Here I go!

2
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,580
Hm?

3
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,930
Makoto, throw the ball already!

4
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,175
Say, did you hear something just now?

5
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,790
Did you hear?

6
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,890
Hear what?

7
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,630
Huh?

Hey, Makoto!

10
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Here goes!

11
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,500
There!

12
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600

Ah, damn it.

17
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,790
Got it!

18
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,890
Yesterday...

19
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,950
My pudding...

20
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,380
I didn't get to eat it.

21
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,280
What's that about pudding?

22
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,160
Your sister probably ate it again.

23
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,405
Based on the novel by
Yasutaka Tsutsui

24
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,410
And I especially saved it for later!

25
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,445
She shouldn't have eaten it... Stupid sister!

26
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:42,545
Uh-oh, there we go.

27
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,230
I did it again...

28
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,340
Big sis?

29
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,440
Big sis!

30
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,050
Huh?

31
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,540
Makoto! Makoto!

32
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,925
Up! Look up!

33
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:05,025
Up?

34
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,290
Ouch!

35
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Get up already.

<b>The Girl Who Leapt Through Time</b>

00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,250
Why did you turn off my alarm?!

38
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,440
You did it yourself. I'm off!

39
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,660
Today, July 13th, is known as NICE day.

40
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,610

From 7-1-3, you get NICE.

44
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,865
You're finally up, Makoto?

45
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:50,965
Morning, Dad.

46
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,205
Mornin'.

47
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,670
I'm off.

48
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,245
Makoto, wait, wait, wait.

49
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:02,500
What?

50
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,810
Take these to Auntie Witch on the way
back. Tell her they're from Grandma.

51
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,005
I don't want to carry this stuff to school!

52
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:10,820
And also...

53
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,370
Ask her when she's finally
going to get married.

54
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,310
Good.

Oh, Makoto.

70
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,485
You should give yourself some
more time to get to school.

71
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:08,292
Like you're one to talk!

72
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,065
Slept in again, I bet.

73
00:05:10,165 --> 00:05:10,860
Shut up!

74
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,270
What's in the basket?

75
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,645
None of your business!

76
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:14,280
Why? Tell me!

Barely on time again?

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,970
You'd probably feel a lot better
if you just came in late.

80
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,850
You're early, Kousuke. Did you
forget to jerk off this morning?

81
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,450
Shut up! You guys are just too late.

82
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,270
I wasn't "barely on time". Look.

83
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,750
We're in luck today.

84
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,340
I'm in luck today.

85
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,470
What's that supposed to mean?

86
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,785
"When you're out of luck, nothing goes
right". I thought that didn't apply to me.

87
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:47,150
Since I'm more lucky than not.

88
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,460
Okay, guess why the teacher was late.

89
00:05:50,495 --> 00:05:51,820
A quiz?!

90
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,920
Yes, Hayakawa, correct!

Director
Hosoda Mamoru

92
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,935
Still, I'm more lucky than not.

93
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,520
I have good luck and intuition.

94
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,750
Thanks to that, my
marks aren't too shabby.

95
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,440
I'm not exactly smart, but
you couldn't call me stupid.

96
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,540
Five minutes left!

97
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,640
Couldn't call me stupid...

98
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,300
Five minutes left.

99
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
That was an exception.

100
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,720
I'm not great with my hands, but I'm
not clumsy enough to be laughed at.

101
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:36,250
I also don't make too many blunders
that need to be erased from my memory.

102
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,155
What are you doing,
stupid! The extinguisher!

103
00:06:44,255 --> 00:06:45,470
Takase-kun, extinguisher!

104
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:45,920
Y- Yes!

105
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,850
That was also an exception.

106
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,180
Are you okay?

107
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,820
Singed my bangs a bit.

108
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:55,010
I'm usually pretty careful, so
I've never been seriously injured.

109
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,850
The same goes for complex
human relations...

110
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,280
H- Hey!

111
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,630
Aw geez!

112
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,200
What the heck is this!

113
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,410
Why you!

114
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,260
I don't think blood-type
fortune telling matters here.

115
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,270
But it says extremely bad
luck. Isn't that risky?

116
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,960
She's the one who gets to
decide if it's risky or not.

117
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,010
Makoto.

118
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,440
What?

119
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,935
Did you decide between
sciences or humanities?

120
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:48,385
Not yet. You?

121
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:49,200
Nope.

122
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,690
That's good.

123
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,865
Can't make up your mind right away, yeah?

124
00:07:52,965 --> 00:07:55,005
Who knows what'll happen in the future?

125
00:07:55,105 --> 00:07:57,500
It never ends...

126
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,910
Hey, Makoto!

127
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,715
How long are you gonna be?

128
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,455
Why don't you help then?

129
00:08:03,555 --> 00:08:05,555
Yeah, right.

130
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,460
Hurry up!

131
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,220
What will Chiaki-kun go with?

132
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,515
Probably sciences. He can't read kanji.

133
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:18,455
He's amazing at math.

134
00:08:18,555 --> 00:08:19,440
And only math.

135
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,440
And why are we talking about him?

136
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,190
Hey, the questionnaires are
still here! Who's on duty today?

137
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,570
Who is it?

138
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,670
You, of course!

139
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,280
What a pain...

140
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,510
"Time waits for no-"

141
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,650
Huh?

142
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Hm?

143
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,940
I thought someone was here...

144
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,960
A locked room mystery...

145
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,490
What's that...

146
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,565
You're such a moron. My stomach hurts!

147
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:09,275
You're laughing way too hard.

148
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,680
Yeah, you are.

149
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,335
But it's hilarious!

150
00:12:12,435 --> 00:12:13,550
It's not.

151
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,815
Want to get a CT scan at our hospital?

152
00:12:15,915 --> 00:12:16,790
I'm fine.

153
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,645
Be careful. Something might happen again.

154
00:12:19,745 --> 00:12:21,955
It won't. I won't have it.

155
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,665
But stuff doesn't usually
fall on its own, yeah?

156
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:27,205
It didn't fall on its own! Someone was there!

157
00:12:27,305 --> 00:12:28,077
Someone?

158
00:12:28,177 --> 00:12:29,050
Who?

159
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,175
You?...

160
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,610
Why would I knock you over?

161
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,650
You?...

162
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,750
So I'm the culprit now?

163
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Then who?

164
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,555
Man, it's hot.

165
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,710
It's almost summer break. Hang in there.

166
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,190
That's right! Summer break! The
three of us should go somewhere!

167
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,350
Like where?

168
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,630
Let's go to a night game.

169
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,665
We just went last month. You
only have baseball in your head.

170
00:12:58,765 --> 00:12:59,782
Where then?

171
00:12:59,882 --> 00:13:00,911
Like the beach.

172
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:02,500
It's too hot.

173
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,310
Then fireworks. In yukatas!

174
00:13:05,345 --> 00:13:06,970
I don't have one.

175
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,875
Kousuke, where do you want to go?

176
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,520
The library.

177
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,790
To study hard.

178
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,680
If you keep studying in
this heat, you'll go crazy.

179
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,230
You guys slack too much.

180
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,355
We're not trying to get into
med school or anything.

181
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:22,835
So what are you going to do?

182
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,060
A hotel tycoon.

183
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,765
Or maybe an oil magnate.

184
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:30,865
Be serious about it!

185
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Say.

186
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,465
What are you going to do, Chiaki?

187
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,430
Me?

188
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:40,530
I'll...

189
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,780
You two should do some serious thinking.

190
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,180
Going home?

191
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,915
Gotta run some errands for Mom.

192
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,975
Don't be like that. You're
leaving me alone with this guy?

193
00:13:56,075 --> 00:13:57,692
Bye. See you.

194
00:13:57,792 --> 00:13:59,792
Hey. Hey!

195
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,480
Come on.

196
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,190
The dwarves are about to pop up!

197
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,290
Sheesh.

198
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,650
Hey! Are you blind or something?!

199
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,750
I'm sorry!

200
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,790
If today...

201
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,940
If today were a normal day, there
wouldn't have been any problems.

202
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,040
But...

203
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,700
I'd forgotten that today was
an extremely unlucky day.

204
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,225
It's crazy... but I'm going to die.

205
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,330
This is it.

206
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,240
If I had known, I would
have gotten up earlier.

207
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,270
I wouldn't have slept in.
Wouldn't have been late.

208
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,460
Done a better job on my tempura.

209
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,960
Avoid being knocked over by stupid boys.

210
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,140
And today was supposed to be NICE day...

211
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,825
Hey! Are you blind or something?!

212
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,190
Apologize! Apologize this very instant!

213
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,800
I'm sorry!

214
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,540
Do you know why you've got
eyes on the front of...

215
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,065
your head? To see where're
you going! Got it?!

216
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:05,240
Yes! I'm very sorry.

217
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,550
Honestly, sheesh...

218
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,190
Mama, look!

219
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,215
Oh, it's already that late.

220
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,970
How...?

221
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,090
How?!

222
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,450
Yes.

223
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,430
Yoshiyama-san.

224
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,745
Don't be so anxious, she'll be here soon.

225
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:18,230
Makoto!

226
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:20,330
Auntie!

227
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,430
Auntie Witch!

228
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,590
Am I alive? I'm alive, right?

229
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,450
I don't look strange anywhere, right?!

230
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,940
Your bangs look strange.

231
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,410
That was a time leap.

232
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,380
Time leap?!

233
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,110
You were about to be hit by a train?

234
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,550
You were thrown off your bike?

235
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,815
But before you knew it, you'd gone
back to a slightly earlier time.

236
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:50,510
Yes!

237
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,610
That's a time leap.

238
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,820
Time is irreversible, you know.

239
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,950
Irreversible?

240
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,160
You can't reverse the flow of time.

241
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,410
Which means that you were the
one who went back in time.

242
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:05,845
You traveled through time
and returned to the past.

243
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,120
Really?

244
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,270
It's not that rare. Many
girls do it at your age.

245
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,015
No, no, no way. Never.

246
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
It happened to me, too.

247
00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:20,610
For real?!

248
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,535
For example, on Sunday
I would sleep in late.

249
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,530
And then I'd think, "I don't feel
like doing anything today," you know?

250
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:33,360
And before I knew it, it was
already night. That gave me a start!

251
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,180
Where did my precious Sunday go?

252
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,150
Listen seriously. I'm being serious here.

253
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,715
Aren't you glad you're alive?

254
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,665
Try to look a little happier?

255
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,730
Hey.

256
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,145
Help me here.

257
00:18:59,245 --> 00:19:01,245
Yes.

258
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,025
Show me how you did it.

259
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,600
As if I could!

260
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,305
If you learn the trick, you can do it again.

261
00:19:10,405 --> 00:19:12,405
I can't, I tell you!

262
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,810
But you actually leaped, didn't you?

263
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,190
Like this?

264
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,290
Yes. Hold it there.

265
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
What? Earthquake?

266
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,290
Big sis, no! Don't!

267
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,590
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was all my fault.

268
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,420
Why are you doing this?
Because I ate your pudding?

269
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,410
Wh-Why what?

270
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,115
Big sis, don't die!

271
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,570
I won't.

272
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,440
Where are you going?

273
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,960
To the convenience store!

274
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,085
If you want pudding, I'll go buy it for you,

275
00:20:21,185 --> 00:20:22,555
No need. Don't worry.

276
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,407
Are you mad?

277
00:20:23,507 --> 00:20:24,770
I'm not.

278
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,455
You really aren't?

279
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:28,555
Yes, really.

280
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,690
Damn!

281
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,880
Awesome!

282
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,295
It's impossible to travel through time.

283
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,960
You can't just leap. No way.

284
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,450
I could never do something like that.

285
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,120
Here I...

286
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:41,410
...go!

287
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
Ouch, ouch!

288
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Where am I?

289
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,340
Oh, back home.

290
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,460
Pudding...

291
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,855
My pudding's here. Which means...

292
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,395
Tuesday, July 12th.

293
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:52,150
Today, Japanese Standard Time...

294
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,265
Wasn't there some pudding?

295
00:23:04,365 --> 00:23:05,250
Can I have it?

296
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,870
Isn't it your sister's?

297
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,225
She'll probably have something to
eat with Kousuke-kun and Chiaki-kun.

298
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:12,750
I can? Yay!

299
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,210
No, you can't! It's mine!

300
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Makoto?

301
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
You're home?

302
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,350
Ouch...

303
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,775
The pudding! Where is it?

304
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,110
Gone...

305
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,210
You saw?

306
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,490
Yeah, I saw!

307
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,700
Eh, what is it?

308
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,155
That girl just did an awesome jump.

309
00:23:48,255 --> 00:23:49,180
She sure did.

310
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,400
And she disappeared for a moment.

311
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,380
How could she do that?

312
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,795
He's starting to tell tales again.

313
00:23:55,895 --> 00:23:57,935
I'm not lying! I saw it!

314
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,960
Did I... leap?

315
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,770
Great!

316
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,440
This...

317
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,270
This...

318
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,370
...is not a dream.

319
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,670
I can leap. I can!

320
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,380
I'm off!

321
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,910
Take care!

322
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,010
Take care.

323
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,335
What time is it?!

324
00:24:51,435 --> 00:24:52,280
Why?

325
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,230
So, why is today, July
13th, known as NICE day?

326
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
Good morning!

327
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,360
Morning!

328
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,460
Good morning!

329
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,810
Mornin'.

330
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,910
Morning!

331
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,760
Huh?

332
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,520
Barely on time again?

333
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,220
You'd probably feel a lot better
if you just came in late.

334
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,885
You're early, Kousuke. Did you
forget to jerk off this morn-

335
00:25:31,985 --> 00:25:34,740
Stop babbling. Make
sure you wake up early.

336
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,390
What? Why are you early today?

337
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,690
I'm done!

338
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Takase-kun.

339
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,445
Let's switch groups.

340
00:25:55,545 --> 00:25:57,545
Sure, but why?

341
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,505
Don't panic! Turn off the gas!

342
00:26:06,605 --> 00:26:07,905
Takase-kun, extinguisher!

343
00:26:08,005 --> 00:26:10,005
Y- Yes!

344
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,490
Takase, you jerk! I'll remember that!

345
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,590
Sorry...

346
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,780
Say, about Chiaki-kun...

347
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:25,335
I don't have time for that right now.

348
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,500
What?

349
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,630
Y- You okay?

350
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,470
Makoto, did you decide between
sciences or humanities?

351
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,910
Maybe I should try going overseas.

352
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,050
What's that?

353
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,370
Like a student exchange or something?

354
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,845
What are you saying? You
failed the English level 3!

355
00:26:50,945 --> 00:26:54,160
Aw, come on. Time waits for no one!

356
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,125
Hey, Makoto!

357
00:26:55,225 --> 00:26:57,225
Yo!

358
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,680
A melon soda and two colas.

359
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,125
Why karaoke instead of baseball?

360
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:04,500
We can do that after karaoke.

361
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,900
I refuse to follow a tight schedule.

362
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:17,500
Time waits for no one,
time waits for no one...

363
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,395
Your time is up in five minutes.

364
00:27:16,495 --> 00:27:17,575
We'll be leaving then.

365
00:27:17,675 --> 00:27:19,520
Time's up?

366
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,740
A melon soda and two colas.

367
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,560
Why karaoke instead of baseball?

368
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,065
What're you doing, Makoto?

369
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:31,020
Nothing.

370
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,160
Actually, I tripped.

371
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,625
Tripped how? And weren't you
sitting here a second ago?!

372
00:27:35,725 --> 00:27:36,830
Who cares. Sing on!

373
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:46,420
Time waits for no one,
time waits for no one...

374
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,055
Your time is up in five minutes.

375
00:27:43,155 --> 00:27:43,730
We'll...

376
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,510
Yes, we'll be leaving then...

377
00:27:47,545 --> 00:27:49,545
Not!

378
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,810
What're you doing, Makoto?

379
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,000
I tripped.

380
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,295
Tripped how? And weren't you
sitting here a second ago?!

381
00:27:57,395 --> 00:28:01,560
I'm not done yet! I'm
gonna sing a hundred songs!

382
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:06,500
Ah, excuse me. A melon soda,
a cola and a ginger ale.

383
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,750
I'm back...

384
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,635
What happened to your voice?

385
00:28:11,735 --> 00:28:12,980
Karaoke.

386
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,085
How much did you sing to
do that to your voice?

387
00:28:15,185 --> 00:28:16,772
About ten hours.

388
00:28:16,872 --> 00:28:18,390
Don't be ridiculous.

389
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,380
I'm beat... What's for dinner?

390
00:28:21,415 --> 00:28:23,415
Chicken stew.

391
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,330
Let's do teppanyaki or something!

392
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,905
We had it the day before yesterday.

393
00:28:28,005 --> 00:28:29,840
Come on, teppanyaki!

394
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,700
Stop moaning. How about coming
home earlier and helping?

395
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,100
W- What happened?

396
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
Nothing.

397
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:44,370
This is it! Let's dig in!

398
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,620
How do you catch my batted balls?! Damn!

399
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,375
Yeah, how do you catch
them with that form?

400
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,950
Again?!

401
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,050
How can you read my pitches?!

402
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,115
There's nothing I can't read!

403
00:29:05,215 --> 00:29:07,225
I can see it all!

404
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,895
One person will win every time!

405
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,120
?? Tes Souhaits? That's quite a treat.

406
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,505
Don't worry. It's to show my appreciation
for all the advice you've given.

407
00:29:37,605 --> 00:29:40,325
Even if I use up my allowance...

408
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:43,395
...I can just return to
the day I get my allowance!

409
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:46,100
This way, I haven't spent a penny!

410
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,230
Really, I can come and go as I please.

411
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:52,345
I can sleep all I want in the morning, I don't
have to go back when I forget something...

412
00:29:52,445 --> 00:29:54,870
...and I don't need to finish
a buffet in 90 minutes!

413
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,445
Oh, if you ever miss a TV show,
let me know. I'll tape it for you.

414
00:29:59,545 --> 00:30:00,395
I'm glad.

415
00:30:00,495 --> 00:30:01,590
Why?

416
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,885
Looks like you're not using
it for anything important.

417
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:05,490
No way!

418
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:09,700
Time leaping is the best! I just can't quit.

419
00:30:09,735 --> 00:30:13,815
Every day is so much fun!
I can't stop laughing!

420
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,930
When you're enjoying yourself, doesn't that...

421
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:25,260
mean somebody else is
suffering as a result?

422
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,660
Does it?

423
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,760
Who knows.

424
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,930
This is good.

425
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:38,735
It doesn't! It's fine. Whatever
happens, I can just go back!

426
00:30:38,835 --> 00:30:41,895
I can reset as many times as I want.

427
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,280
What's this? You've got
extremely good luck today! You...

428
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,165
won't get another chance
like this until next year!

429
00:30:52,265 --> 00:30:54,910
You decided to do it today, right?

430
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,440
Break a leg!

431
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,195
What if she really does?

432
00:30:58,295 --> 00:31:00,295
Senpai!

433
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,440
Me?

434
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,760
No.

435
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,310
Um, it's...

436
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,600
Kaho!

437
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,240
We're going!

438
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,710
Yeah!

439
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,625
What do they want?

440
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:15,725
Just go.

441
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,900
Stop throwing like a girl!

442
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,400
Throw with your shoulder. Your shoulder!

443
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,030
Hey.

444
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,305
You're late!

445
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:31,797
Sorry.

446
00:31:31,897 --> 00:31:33,220
Um...

447
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,655
Those girls? Underclassmen
from the volunteer club.

448
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,185
What'd they want?

449
00:31:39,285 --> 00:31:40,790
Well...

450
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,185
They asked if we're dating.

451
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,290
We're not, right?

452
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,870
That's what I said.

453
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,380
And? What then?

454
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,480
I'm not really sure...

455
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,785
...but I guess I was asked out.

456
00:31:52,885 --> 00:31:54,082
Way to go!

457
00:31:54,182 --> 00:31:55,310
For real?!

458
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,195
So what'd you say?

459
00:31:56,295 --> 00:31:58,295
"I can't".

460
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,390
How mean!

461
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,680
Hey now!

462
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,230
After she confessed?!

463
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,495
Why'd you turn her down?!
I'd definitely date her!

464
00:32:05,595 --> 00:32:06,750
Listen here...

465
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:10,770
Doesn't she look like the girl
you liked in junior high?

466
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,870
She doesn't!

467
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,005
It'll be too late if you
change your mind later!

468
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:20,125
Stop talking about it already.

469
00:32:20,225 --> 00:32:21,237
Bye.

470
00:32:21,337 --> 00:32:23,337
Yeah.

471
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,870
Hm? Where's your bike?

472
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:35,955
A little something...

473
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:36,730
Hop on the back.

474
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,465
You're giving me a ride? Lucky!

475
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,955
I wonder if he's really not interested.

476
00:32:49,055 --> 00:32:51,520
When he says no, he means it.

477
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,795
I'm a bit relieved.

478
00:32:53,895 --> 00:32:54,770
Why?

479
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,175
If he got a girlfriend, he
would take good care about her.

480
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,810
That's how he is.

481
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,160
Then he couldn't play baseball.

482
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,660
You can't call catch playing baseball...

483
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:12,550
Somehow I thought the three of
us would be together forever...

484
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:17,500
Kousuke would scold me
for being late, and you...

485
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,765
would make fun of me for
not catching the ball...

486
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Makoto.

487
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,030
Want to...

488
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,420
...go out with me?

489
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,620
Stop.

490
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,020
Stop for a sec.

491
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,200
What's that?

492
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,715
What did you just say?

493
00:33:56,815 --> 00:33:57,750
Let's go out.

494
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,975
Where did this come from?

495
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,680
From the "what if Kousuke got a girlfriend".

496
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,740
I'm... not that ugly, right?

497
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,575
You serious?

498
00:34:08,675 --> 00:34:10,675
Serious.

499
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,460
W- W-Wait a minute!

500
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,980
What is it now?

501
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,600
Makoto?

502
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,990
What the hell are you doing?

503
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,490
Nothing.

504
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:50,765
It'll be too late if you
change your mind later!

505
00:34:50,865 --> 00:34:52,930
Stop talking about it already.

506
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,020
Bye.

507
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,120
Yeah.

508
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,890
Hm? Where's your bike?

509
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,020
Hop on the back.

510
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,615
That Kousuke beat me to it!

511
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,690
It's not like he actually got a girlfriend.

512
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:15,885
That's what you say now, but once he
gets a girl, he'll put her first.

513
00:35:15,985 --> 00:35:17,370
You can't be sure.

514
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:21,245
Damn, with him gone, we
can only play catch.

515
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,112
Like I said, why don't hold off on the...

516
00:35:23,212 --> 00:35:25,365
speculating until he
actually gets a girlfriend?

517
00:35:25,465 --> 00:35:28,247
Maybe it would be for the best.

518
00:35:28,282 --> 00:35:31,030
In that case... want to go out?

519
00:35:31,065 --> 00:35:33,110
Where did this-

520
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:40,635
That's what you say now, but once he
gets a girl, he'll put her first.

521
00:35:40,735 --> 00:35:44,305
B- By the way, my sister is such an idiot!

522
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,630
I'm talking about Kousuke!

523
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,780
Let's talk about my sister!

524
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,815
If Kousuke got a girlfriend...

525
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,640
My sister was-

526
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,740
Want to date me?!

527
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:01,290
It'll be too late if you
change your mind later.

528
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,120
Stop talking about it already.

529
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,270
Huh? Makoto, get on.

530
00:36:07,305 --> 00:36:07,840
I'm fine.

531
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,085
Hey, what's with you all of a sudden?

532
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,280
What's with her?

533
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,825
Must be your fault!

534
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:17,925
Why?!

535
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,640
I thought that you liked Chiaki-kun.

536
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,955
You think that you have to take care
of him since he's a joker, right?

537
00:36:29,055 --> 00:36:31,820
Well, I did say that before, but...

538
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,180
Why did you undo it? You
could just go out with him.

539
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,315
No, no, no, no.

540
00:36:36,415 --> 00:36:37,280
Why?

541
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,530
I totally can't imagine being
anything but friends with Chiaki.

542
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,370
If it didn't work out, you could just go
back to before you started going out.

543
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,025
You can do that, right?

544
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:47,610
There's no need for that.

545
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,585
It's also possible to fall in love
after you've been confessed to.

546
00:36:50,685 --> 00:36:52,430
That'll NEVER happen!

547
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:55,640
Yes... Because you undid it.

548
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:01,305
Poor Chiaki... He worked so
hard to tell you how he felt.

549
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,590
But he has no idea, huh?

550
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:16,180
Chiaki-kun transferred to our
school this spring, right?

551
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,705
He went through a bunch of schools, right?

552
00:37:18,805 --> 00:37:19,630
Sounds like it.

553
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:22,165
Is it true that he returned from abroad?

554
00:37:22,265 --> 00:37:24,265
Nope.

555
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,890
He's too dumb.

556
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:26,705
So it's not...

557
00:37:26,805 --> 00:37:27,760
Totally.

558
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,945
I wonder if something happened
at his previous school.

559
00:37:30,045 --> 00:37:31,542
Why don't you ask him?

560
00:37:31,642 --> 00:37:33,171
I don't know his e-mail.

561
00:37:33,271 --> 00:37:34,730
You're in the same class!

562
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:37,105
You're such good friends with him.

563
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:39,052
I'm not gonna ask that.

564
00:37:39,152 --> 00:37:40,965
And we're not that close.

565
00:37:41,065 --> 00:37:41,760
Liar.

566
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,860
Nuh-uh, I tell you.

567
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,750
Stop it!

568
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,395
They're getting him back
for the extinguisher.

569
00:37:57,495 --> 00:37:59,495
Stop that!

570
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,930
Who is it?

571
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,310
It's Mamiya!

572
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,410
Not done yet?

573
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,405
See you, Takase!

574
00:38:15,505 --> 00:38:17,505
Bye!

575
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,350
Man, you're dripping wet.

576
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,850
Takase-kun, are you all right?

577
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:27,545
Yesterday they splashed cola on me, so I
returned the favor with some coffee milk.

578
00:38:27,645 --> 00:38:30,605
If you do that, they'll
keep bullying you, right?

579
00:38:30,705 --> 00:38:32,705
Hey, Makoto!

580
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:39,465
Did you see yesterday's nighter?
Saito puts on some mad pressure!

581
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,865
You looked away just now.

582
00:38:41,965 --> 00:38:43,520
I didn't.

583
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,075
What are you up to?

584
00:38:45,175 --> 00:38:46,060
Nothing.

585
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,930
Just spit it out. What are you up to?

586
00:38:49,965 --> 00:38:51,965
I said nothing!

587
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,180
What's wrong?

588
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,730
Konno, you...

589
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:05,580
Why did you ask me to
fry tempura that time?!

590
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,295
Ah, no... I couldn't have known that...

591
00:39:08,395 --> 00:39:10,435
It's your fault, stupid!

592
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,725
Who's stupid? Keep complaining
and I'll throw this!

593
00:39:13,825 --> 00:39:14,570
Hey!

594
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,670
Yeah, throw it!

595
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,130
Sorry, it sorta slipped.

596
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,230
Stupid!

597
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,715
What a rude guy. Calling others stupid?

598
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,710
You call me stupid all the time.

599
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,130
In my case, it's a term of endearment.

600
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:40,260
Come on, where's the comeback?
Don't leave me hangin'.

601
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,640
Isn't she out of sorts today?
Don't you think, Hayakawa-san?

602
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,815
You are absolutely right.

603
00:39:45,915 --> 00:39:46,760
Why so formal?

604
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:50,430
Ah, well, we haven't really talked much...

605
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,380
Makoto!

606
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,320
She's not here.

607
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,820
Why isn't she?

608
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,920
Did something happen?

609
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,650
No, nothing.

610
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,250
You probably pissed her
off over something stupid.

611
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,855
Don't say she has huge feet or
whatever. She's sensitive about it.

612
00:40:47,955 --> 00:40:49,995
I said nothing happened!

613
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,110
Nothing!

614
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,700
Nothing, right?

615
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:04,410
Throw it already!

616
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,945
I can't throw while I'm thinking!

617
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,580
No good.

618
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,680
I don't get it!

619
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,590
Oh, it's from Yuri.

620
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,690
"Something really great happened. "

621
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,120
Something great?

622
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,530
Yes.

623
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,460
Wait a second.

624
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,070
What was that...

625
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:18,135
Hurry up, or they'll be sold out.

626
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,490
Today I don't really feel too well...

627
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,660
No way. Wanna go to the nurse's office?

628
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,760
No, I'm fine.

629
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,820
Hey, hurry up! That's quite a sight!

630
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,680
Stop it, Takase!

631
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,850
You're the ones who didn't
stop when I told you to!

632
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:16,240
We're sorry!

633
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,170
If you're sorry, then you shouldn't
have done this in the first place!

634
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,050
This is dangerous.

635
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:20,695
Did anyone go tell the teachers?

636
00:43:20,795 --> 00:43:22,540
Hey, look there!

637
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,840
Takase-kun, stop it! Takase-kun!

638
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,120
Konno!

639
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,405
You just gave me an order, didn't you?!

640
00:43:34,505 --> 00:43:36,337
I- I didn't!

641
00:43:36,437 --> 00:43:38,437
You did!

642
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:45,050
What?

643
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:48,220
Why? Damn, dammit!

644
00:43:48,255 --> 00:43:50,255
Damn it all!

645
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,230
Stop it!

646
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,410
Takase!

647
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,510
S- S-Sto-

648
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,670
Takase!

649
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,160
Chiaki!

650
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,260
Chiaki!

651
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:32,665
Whoa, that was a really bad sound.

652
00:44:32,765 --> 00:44:33,767
What year are you in?

653
00:44:33,867 --> 00:44:34,835
Quickly, get a teacher!

654
00:44:34,935 --> 00:44:35,540
Where's a teacher?

655
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,730
I'm not my fault! I... I...!

656
00:44:38,765 --> 00:44:39,110
Yuri! Yuri?

657
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,210
Are you all right?!

658
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,930
Don't cry. It's not that serious.

659
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,480
What if it leaves a scar?

660
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,770
Then I'll do something about it.

661
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,000
Something?

662
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,100
I'll do something.

663
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,700
No boys.

664
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,800
Does it hurt?

665
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,340
Let me see.

666
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:27,930
No.

667
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:30,030
Just do it.

668
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,840
Thanks.

669
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:42,210
I'm sorry, really!

670
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,700
Why?

671
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,010
I mean, I'm sorry, really.

672
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:50,460
For real, who goes to a
nighter on the first date!

673
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:55,290
Weren't the three of us supposed to go
together? I was looking forward to it!

674
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:57,460
That's why I said I'm sorry!

675
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,045
Hayakawa-san was okay with a nighter.

676
00:46:00,145 --> 00:46:02,145
So you're going out?

677
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:04,270
Of course.

678
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:07,295
You okay, Makoto?

679
00:46:07,395 --> 00:46:08,372
For real?

680
00:46:08,472 --> 00:46:10,472
I can't?

681
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,850
But yeah, Yuri-chan
understands my hobbies.

682
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,550
Lucky you!

683
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,070
Hey, stupid! Look where you threw it!

684
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,200
I'm home.

685
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:33,810
Hm, where's dinner?

686
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:35,065
I'm making it right now.

687
00:46:35,165 --> 00:46:35,820
Why?

688
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,920
Big sis ate everything.

689
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:39,910
Geez!

690
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:44,000
What is this? After he said he liked me!

691
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,420
I was about to die...

692
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,060
What is this?

693
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,740
Ninety?

694
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:32,730
Makoto!

695
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,555
Let me go!

696
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,590
We've been had.

697
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:39,410
Totally duped.

698
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,135
The world is full of lies.

699
00:47:41,235 --> 00:47:44,180
Wait! Wait for me!

700
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:44,850
Hurry up!

701
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,140
We can only play catch like this.

702
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,395
I'm gonna drag Chiaki here tomorrow.

703
00:47:51,495 --> 00:47:52,920
That would be unfair to Yuri.

704
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:57,780
If I tell him you're feeling
lonely, he'll definitely come.

705
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,090
I'm not especially lonely.

706
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:04,095
He didn't go with Hayakawa
because you turned him down?

707
00:48:04,195 --> 00:48:05,700
I didn't turn him down!

708
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,180
Oh?

709
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,280
What's that "oh" for?!

710
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,550
Good grief.

711
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:14,285
Why don't you get a girlfriend?

712
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:19,390
If I get a girlfriend, you'll be all alone.

713
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,890
I thought you liked Kousuke-kun.

714
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:32,310
He's the one who always helps you
when you're in trouble, right?

715
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,875
He's like that with everyone.

716
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,570
Go out with him.

717
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:38,130
How did you come to that solution?

718
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:42,540
You know... If it doesn't work out,
you can just go back to before.

719
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,385
I'll never do that.

720
00:48:44,485 --> 00:48:45,360
Why?

721
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,255
Playing with the feelings of others...

722
00:48:47,355 --> 00:48:49,355
Is too cruel for you?

723
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:56,890
Isn't that what you've been doing because
you wanted to try going back in time.

724
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:58,860
That's how you saw it?

725
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,960
I guess.

726
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,480
You're a witch.

727
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,380
You really are Auntie Witch.

728
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,955
This painting...

729
00:49:13,055 --> 00:49:14,160
You noticed?

730
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:18,425
Yes, the one you've been
restoring since forever.

731
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:25,763
It's a mysterious painting. If you look at it...

732
00:49:25,863 --> 00:49:29,773
for a long time, you feel
completely at peace.

733
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:36,330
We don't know its artist, or whether
it even has any artistic value.

734
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:40,765
But... we learned one thing
during the restoration.

735
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:47,535
This painting was drawn hundreds
years ago in a time of war and famine.

736
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:56,470
Why did someone draw this painting when
the world was on the verge of destruction?

737
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:40,910
What will you do, Konno? You're the only
one who hasn't turned in a course plan yet.

738
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:43,010
Konno.

739
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,380
Konno.

740
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,740
Konno!

741
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,690
Yes!

742
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:51,300
Don't get carried away just
because you did well on the test.

743
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,400
Yes!

744
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,870
Strange...

745
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:05,420
It was ninety the other day.

746
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,320
Yes, go ask her.

747
00:51:10,355 --> 00:51:11,375
Um, but...

748
00:51:11,475 --> 00:51:12,697
What?

749
00:51:12,797 --> 00:51:14,640
W- W-Wait!

750
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,140
Whatwhatwhatwhat?

751
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,345
Konno-senpai, we're from
the volunteer club.

752
00:51:19,445 --> 00:51:21,625
We have a serious question to ask you.

753
00:51:21,725 --> 00:51:23,280
I- It's nothing!

754
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,145
Lately, you and Kousuke-senpai...

755
00:51:25,245 --> 00:51:26,975
...are together all the time, right?

756
00:51:27,075 --> 00:51:27,697
Well...

757
00:51:27,797 --> 00:51:28,350
Stop!

758
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:31,110
Are you going out, after all?

759
00:51:31,145 --> 00:51:32,407
Are you?

760
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:34,507
Are you?!

761
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:43,480
It was back when I was still in junior high.

762
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:47,100
The volunteer club from
Kuranose high school came...

763
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,170
to the retirement home
where my grandma was.

764
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:57,150
Grandma really liked one of the members,
and told me about him many times.

765
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:04,050
"He's a very kind and wonderful person,"
she would repeat again and again.

766
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:13,350
After hearing that so many times, I came
to like him even though I'd never met him.

767
00:52:13,385 --> 00:52:15,385
What a beautiful story.

768
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:21,530
After I entered high school, I learned
that his name was Tsuda Kousuke.

769
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:24,350
So stuff like that really happens...

770
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:26,865
But, as you see, she's very shy.

771
00:52:26,965 --> 00:52:29,310
So we were urging her to act.

772
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:33,280
The other day we finally got her to confess.

773
00:52:33,315 --> 00:52:34,802
Oh, the other day.

774
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,902
Kousuke-senpai said...

775
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,270
"I already have someone I like. "

776
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:43,835
"So I'm sorry but I can't go out with you. "

777
00:52:43,935 --> 00:52:45,180
Oh, um, well...

778
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,080
It wasn't anything like that.

779
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:50,720
"Someone who's usually stupid
got better grades than me. "

780
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,630
"I can't afford to slack off, so... "

781
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:55,960
"I'm very sorry, but... "

782
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:03,125
That "someone stupid" can't be... me?!

783
00:53:03,225 --> 00:53:04,980
And then Kousuke-senpai said...

784
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,495
...that he's not going out with you!

785
00:53:07,595 --> 00:53:09,975
But what is it with you two lately?

786
00:53:10,075 --> 00:53:12,105
It's like the total opposite?!

787
00:53:12,205 --> 00:53:13,715
Please explain yourself!

788
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,815
W- W-Wait a minute!

789
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,817
I got it. I got it!

790
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,495
I'll do something about it.

791
00:53:21,595 --> 00:53:23,032
Something?

792
00:53:23,132 --> 00:53:24,790
Something...?

793
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:28,890
Something!

794
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:40,390
Ouch!

795
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,640
What's with her?

796
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:48,590
Um, it's...

797
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Kaho!

798
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Um...

799
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,140
Kousuke!

800
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:03,425
Huh? Didn't you go to the field?

801
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:06,910
More importantly, her
grandma said that she's...

802
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:10,605
really grateful for your
help in retirement house.

803
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:13,427
Way to go, Kousuke! And then...

804
00:54:13,462 --> 00:54:16,050
W- W-Why do you know my grandma?

805
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:20,040
How? I, ah, met her in the bowling alley...

806
00:54:20,075 --> 00:54:20,975
She's confined to bed!

807
00:54:21,075 --> 00:54:22,520
Ah, not there-

808
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,840
Call me when you're done talking.

809
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,940
W- Wait, Kousuke!

810
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,540
One more try!

811
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:43,130
Ouch!

812
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,260
Um, it's...

813
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,880
Kousuke!

814
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:53,690
Huh? Didn't you go-

815
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:57,955
First of all, you're a coward!
Don't be jealous of my good grades!

816
00:54:58,055 --> 00:54:59,750
And that's got nothing
to do with this, okay?

817
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:01,878
Why are you popping
out of nowhere to brag?

818
00:55:01,978 --> 00:55:03,765
And it's got nothing to do with what?!

819
00:55:03,865 --> 00:55:08,465
Like I said, my grades have nothing
to do with Kaho-chan liking you!

820
00:55:08,565 --> 00:55:10,430
Y- You're wrong.

821
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:11,890
You're wrong!

822
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:13,990
W- Wait, Kaho-chan!

823
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,770
You're wrong, she says.

824
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:17,870
Kousuke, wait!

825
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,430
What?!

826
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:29,530
I have to start with something more basic...

827
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,480
Big sis, why are you
messing around so early?

828
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:47,720
Went back too far! And I'm late, to boot!

829
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,820
Makoto, the peaches!

830
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,200
Peaches!

831
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:02,420
Good grief.

832
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,520
Oh-oh, it's a headlock!

833
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,620
No good!

834
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:09,340
What was that?

835
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,510
Awesome.

836
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:12,410
Don't look. Carry on!

837
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,510
You all, get away.

838
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:16,590
Kaho!

839
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,135
I don't really get it, but she
said to come to the courtyard.

840
00:56:20,235 --> 00:56:21,860
Who did?

841
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,745
Where are we going? What
do you want from me?

842
00:56:24,845 --> 00:56:26,015
You'll know once we get there.

843
00:56:26,115 --> 00:56:27,072
Makoto...

844
00:56:27,172 --> 00:56:28,860
Later.

845
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,100
I give up, give up!

846
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,470
"Come to the courtyard"... for this?

847
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:34,090
No idea...

848
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,190
Fly!

849
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:38,470
There!

850
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:46,200
Ouch...

851
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,680
What the hell are you doing?

852
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,490
It hurts.

853
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:54,270
Oh, crap!

854
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,980
Can you stand?

855
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:00,190
Did you sprain it?

856
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:01,650
I'm fine.

857
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,260
No, you're not.

858
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,970
Kousuke-senpai!

859
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:06,575
Lean on me.

860
00:57:06,675 --> 00:57:08,560
T- Thank you.

861
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,595
This is quite a development.

862
00:57:10,695 --> 00:57:12,695
Could it be...?

863
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:14,835
It most certainly could be...

864
00:57:14,935 --> 00:57:16,935
All right!

865
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:19,845
I feel like I did a good thing!

866
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,810
What is this feeling of happiness?

867
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,630
It changed again!

868
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:27,980
Ten?

869
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,080
Ten means...

870
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,820
One?

871
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:38,840
No one's here. Am I too early?

872
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:50,340
Here we go...

873
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:05,710
Excuse me! Can I ask something?

874
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,340
Yuri?

875
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,380
I thought someone was here...

876
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,070
Why?

877
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:19,330
I brought the questionnaires for you.
Did you forget that you're on duty today?

878
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,090
Oh, right.

879
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:25,170
I knew it. Really, you should
appreciate our friendship!

880
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,195
So, what was your question?

881
00:59:27,295 --> 00:59:29,095
Ah, it's nothing.

882
00:59:29,195 --> 00:59:31,195
I see.

883
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,780
Yuri...

884
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,885
You didn't see anyone on your way here?

885
00:59:38,985 --> 00:59:40,250
Anyone?

886
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:42,520
No, never mind.

887
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,320
I see.

888
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,330
Kousuke?

889
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:54,235
"Looks like I got confessed to. "

890
00:59:56,390 --> 01:00:00,810
Sheesh, who do you think
you need to thank for that?

891
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:07,430
No way...

892
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,090
Ma...

893
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:11,470
ko...

894
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,300
to... there.

895
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,420
Where's your house?

896
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,645
Past the station in the south district.

897
01:00:16,745 --> 01:00:19,040
We better drop by a clinic.

898
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,750
Our home one is nearby.

899
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,815
By the way, Makoto...

900
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:28,060
...on the way here I met...

901
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:31,980
...Chiaki-kun.

902
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,750
Kousuke!

903
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:38,060
He went home.

904
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,305
Yeah, holding that first-year's hand.

905
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,060
Gone!

906
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:52,680
Kousuke?

907
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:53,810
It's me.

908
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:57,360
Look, Dad, can you treat a sprain?

909
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,800
No, it's not me.

910
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,740
Yeah, now.

911
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,590
Thank you.

912
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:05,890
Leave your message after-

913
01:01:05,925 --> 01:01:07,925
Damn!

914
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,930
What should I do? Go back in time?

915
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,830
But it's not like anything happened yet...

916
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:20,090
E- Excuse me...

917
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,590
There wasn't a bike accident here?

918
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:25,680
No... I don't think so.

919
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,470
Thank you.

920
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:30,190
Accidents are scary.

921
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:37,590
Kousuke? Where are you? Kousuke?

922
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:45,630
Chiaki.

923
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,860
Kousuke went home.

924
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,205
Man, neither of you came to the field.

925
01:02:52,305 --> 01:02:52,860
Sorry.

926
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:53,905
I'm waiting!

927
01:02:54,005 --> 01:02:55,490
Say...

928
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:59,930
I've wanted to ask you
something for a long time.

929
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,665
Is playing baseball with me fun?

930
01:03:03,765 --> 01:03:04,800
What's that?

931
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:07,795
I like playing baseball with you.

932
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:10,840
You sure suck for someone
who likes playing.

933
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:12,670
All you're good at is brute force.

934
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:16,255
Better than being good at nothing at all.

935
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:19,145
What are you laughing about?!

936
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:22,850
It just feels like we haven't
really talked in a while.

937
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:25,295
What are you talking about?
We've been talking since morning.

938
01:03:25,395 --> 01:03:26,830
Oh, right.

939
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:27,880
You're right.

940
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:29,335
Do you miss me that much?

941
01:03:29,435 --> 01:03:31,292
W- What? Stupid!

942
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:33,392
It's a joke! Man...

943
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,650
Look...

944
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:39,735
I also want to ask you something.

945
01:03:39,835 --> 01:03:40,660
What?

946
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,715
It's a really stupid question though.

947
01:03:42,815 --> 01:03:44,815
What is it?

948
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:46,650
Well...

949
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,750
Just say it, come on.

950
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:52,010
Are you time leaping?

951
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:00,890
You are, aren't you?

952
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,880
Hey, Makoto!

953
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Makoto!

954
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:12,510
Look...

955
01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:15,415
I also want to ask you something.

956
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:19,355
It's a really stupid question though.

957
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:20,430
Well...

958
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:22,130
W- W-Wait a minute.

959
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:24,340
Let's talk about my sister.

960
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:24,910
Why?

961
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:26,820
You know, she's so stupid...

962
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,215
Hey there! I'm trying to...

963
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,160
Never mind.

964
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:35,260
I'll be waiting.

965
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:39,260
How did he...?

966
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:48,390
Zero? So it really was the number
of times I could time leap...

967
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:51,390
I wasted the last one on something stupid...

968
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:55,130
Oh, well. I know that Kousuke is fine now.

969
01:04:55,165 --> 01:04:57,165
Yo, Makoto!

970
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:09,780
Let me borrow your bike a little longer.

971
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,555
Wait, Kousuke!

972
01:05:12,655 --> 01:05:14,655
Ko-

973
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:18,115
Hey! Are you blind or something?!

974
01:05:18,215 --> 01:05:20,260
Apologize! Hey!

975
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,890
Stop, Kousuke!

976
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:29,240
Kousuke!

977
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,420
Kousuke!

978
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:37,740
Stop!

979
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:41,460
Kousuke, Kousuke!

980
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,010
Kousuke, Kousuke!

981
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:55,420
Is she all right?

982
01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:59,355
Hey, she's seriously hurt!

983
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:00,682
Call an ambulance!

984
01:06:00,782 --> 01:06:02,782
How did she...

985
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:33,005
Stop, stop, stop!

986
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,735
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

987
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:38,745
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

988
01:06:38,765 --> 01:06:41,290
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

989
01:06:41,325 --> 01:06:42,860
Stop...

990
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,320
Stop!

991
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:13,340
D- Did it stop?

992
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:16,420
So it really was you.

993
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:20,430
Chiaki?

994
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,000
What are you doing here?

995
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,670
Where's Kousuke?

996
01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:26,770
Still home, I guess.

997
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:29,210
But he just...

998
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,560
Did... you do this?

999
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:41,610
You can leap?

1000
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:43,370
You too?

1001
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:47,210
If I told you that I came from the future...

1002
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:49,270
...would you laugh?

1003
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,280
In my era...

1004
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:57,290
...they've developed a device which lets
you go freely back and forth in time.

1005
01:08:57,390 --> 01:08:58,670
This thing here.

1006
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:01,405
You use it to charge your body.

1007
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:05,685
I used this thing to travel to this time.

1008
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:10,460
But then, I managed to lose it somewhere.

1009
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:13,120
I was frantic.

1010
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:16,440
I looked all around and finally found it.

1011
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:18,540
In the science room.

1012
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:22,780
But it was all used up.

1013
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:27,730
But I'm glad.

1014
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,295
That an idiot got its charge.

1015
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:37,000
I was up every night worrying about
someone using it for bad things.

1016
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,080
W- Why?

1017
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:42,340
Because.

1018
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,220
Because?

1019
01:09:48,450 --> 01:09:52,020
Because there was a painting I had to see.

1020
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:57,120
No matter how far away it was...
No matter where it was...

1021
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:01,220
No matter how dangerous it would be...

1022
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,060
I wanted to see it.

1023
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,150
In my era, it was already destroyed in a fire.

1024
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:16,740
Its whereabouts before
this era are unknown.

1025
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:20,285
The only confirmed record
of its existence...

1026
01:10:20,385 --> 01:10:24,465
...was in this time, this
place and this season.

1027
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,990
You just want... to see it?

1028
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,760
That's all I wanted.

1029
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:36,320
I wanted to remember it for all my life.

1030
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:45,030
But...

1031
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:47,185
There's no point anymore.

1032
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,200
None at all.

1033
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:55,745
You can't go back anymore?
Hey, what do you mean?

1034
01:10:55,845 --> 01:10:59,670
Like I said, I can't go back to my era.

1035
01:10:59,705 --> 01:11:01,705
But why?

1036
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:06,045
To go back and snatch your bike
that Kousuke was going to ride...

1037
01:11:06,145 --> 01:11:09,020
I used up my remaining charge.

1038
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:11,420
W- What will you do?

1039
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,050
There's nothing I can do.

1040
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:15,215
Why did you use it?!

1041
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:17,580
Shouldn't it have been
saved for the right time?!

1042
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,680
It was the right time.

1043
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:26,810
You don't remember, but Kousuke and
that girl died once at that crossing.

1044
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:33,010
A certain someone was crying
with guilt, so I had no choice.

1045
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:41,850
I had to go back, but before
I noticed, it was summer.

1046
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:44,990
Being with you two...

1047
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,320
...was too much fun.

1048
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:13,730
It was the first time I ever saw
a running river on the surface.

1049
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:17,315
It was the first time I ever rode a bike.

1050
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:21,870
It was the first time I ever
knew how vast the sky was.

1051
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:23,680
And above all...

1052
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:29,475
...it was the first time I'd ever
seen so many people in one place.

1053
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,000
Say... Chiaki.

1054
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:34,810
Could it be that...

1055
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:39,245
...there was a connection
between the painting...

1056
01:12:39,410 --> 01:12:42,045
...and the future you lived in?

1057
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:47,730
Hey, tell me.

1058
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,680
I like this era.

1059
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:57,060
You have baseball.

1060
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:59,940
There's no more baseball?!

1061
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:02,445
Where are you looking, stupid?

1062
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:05,070
Stop goofing around.

1063
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,960
About that painting...

1064
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:11,050
About that painting!

1065
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:13,620
If you wait a bit longer, you can see it.

1066
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:15,900
It's being restored right now...

1067
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,320
Let's go together! The three
of us including Kousuke.

1068
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:21,365
I mean, summer break is about to start!

1069
01:13:21,465 --> 01:13:23,970
Hey, Chiaki. Chiaki!

1070
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,400
Sorry, I can't.

1071
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:31,425
I'm going to disappear tomorrow.

1072
01:13:31,525 --> 01:13:33,650
W- Why?

1073
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:38,810
People in the past must not
learn about time leaping.

1074
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:41,170
I've violated that rule.

1075
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:43,910
So...

1076
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:46,000
I won't be seeing you again.

1077
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:49,925
I'll keep quiet! I couldn't ever tell anyone.

1078
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:53,290
Chiaki? Where are you?

1079
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:56,390
Hey, Chiaki...

1080
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:58,620
Chiaki...

1081
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:00,690
Chiaki...

1082
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:03,595
You said that we'd go to a nighter together!

1083
01:14:03,695 --> 01:14:04,490
Sorry.

1084
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:07,300
And you said that we'd go
to a fireworks display!

1085
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:08,580
Really sorry.

1086
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:11,825
Don't you want to see me in a yukata?

1087
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,510
Sorry, I kinda wanna see that.

1088
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:19,140
Idiot!

1089
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:25,690
Chiaki!

1090
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:29,020
Chiaki!

1091
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:38,180
Chiaki, wait up! Chiaki!

1092
01:15:05,410 --> 01:15:07,660
Why did Chiaki-kun leave school?

1093
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,390
I heard he got into debt,
and the yakuza are after him!

1094
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:12,795
Really? Wasn't it because
his parents got divorced?

1095
01:15:12,895 --> 01:15:15,440
They say he's marrying an older girl.

1096
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,155
I heard she got pregnant.

1097
01:15:17,255 --> 01:15:19,655
What, for real?!

1098
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:21,985
Hey, what happened, Makoto?

1099
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:26,550
He's not like that!

1100
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:28,750
Sounds like he stabbed
the guy with a box cutter.

1101
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:31,630
I heard he beat him up with a bat.

1102
01:15:31,730 --> 01:15:33,215
Or slashed him up with a knife.

1103
01:15:33,315 --> 01:15:35,525
I said he's not like that!

1104
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:36,745
Hey, Kousuke!

1105
01:15:36,845 --> 01:15:38,845
Hey! Kousuke!

1106
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:47,850
What's going on...

1107
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:54,725
Forget me... He didn't at least let you know?

1108
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:00,960
Even though he liked you...

1109
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:05,810
Did he say that?

1110
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:07,910
It was plain to see.

1111
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:10,290
You didn't notice?

1112
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:14,925
Well, you've never been
good with that stuff.

1113
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:18,640
Maybe that's why he didn't tell you.

1114
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:23,390
Kousuke.

1115
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:26,710
I'm an awful person.

1116
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:30,320
Someone told me something important...

1117
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,420
...but I undid it.

1118
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:35,335
Why didn't I listen properly?

1119
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:39,630
Makoto?

1120
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:42,025
What are you talking about?

1121
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:44,150
H- Hey!

1122
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:26,980
Calmed down?

1123
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:30,380
Actually...

1124
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:36,795
I thought that you would stay friends
with both Kousuke-kun and Chiaki-kun.

1125
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:43,800
Graduate without dating either of them...

1126
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:48,320
...and then end up dating
someone totally different.

1127
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:51,700
That's what I thought until yesterday.

1128
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:54,530
But it's not like that, is it?

1129
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:03,450
I first fell in love in high school.

1130
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:07,970
We became really close as soon as we met.

1131
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:11,400
It was like we'd known each
other since childhood.

1132
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:14,900
But it was over before we became adults.

1133
01:18:17,010 --> 01:18:19,010
Why?

1134
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:22,060
The timing was probably bad.

1135
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:26,010
What is he doing now?

1136
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,560
I wonder.

1137
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:33,200
He said he would definitely return one day.

1138
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:35,500
Though I didn't plan on waiting for him.

1139
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,980
And so much time has passed.

1140
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:41,460
It didn't last long.

1141
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:44,410
A blink of an eye.

1142
01:18:47,550 --> 01:18:49,550
But, Makoto...

1143
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:53,430
...you're not like me, right?

1144
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:01,260
If someone were late for an appointment...

1145
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:04,420
...wouldn't you run out to meet him?

1146
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:15,000
Makoto, watermelon!

1147
01:19:15,035 --> 01:19:16,340
Father!

1148
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:19,790
What's with her? No food...
Not even watermelon?

1149
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:21,005
It's a broken heart.

1150
01:19:21,105 --> 01:19:21,680
No way!

1151
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:24,330
Miyuki, that was uncalled for.

1152
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:37,420
If someone were late for an appointment...

1153
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,580
...wouldn't you run out to meet him?

1154
01:19:58,490 --> 01:20:00,490
Why?!

1155
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,055
It should have been zero...

1156
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:09,270
Could it be...

1157
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:12,025
Makoto!

1158
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:12,780
Big sis!

1159
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,770
Don't do anything foolish, Makoto!

1160
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:19,080
Makoto!

1161
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:21,740
It's because Chiaki went back in time!

1162
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:24,925
Walking home and fooling around

1163
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:29,315
Then it should also apply to him!

1164
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:31,255
wake mo naku kimi wo okoraseta

1165
01:20:31,355 --> 01:20:28,950
I was teasing you for no reason

1166
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:29,780
Oh, Mako-chan.

1167
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,880
Chiaki can also...!

1168
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:37,865
ironna kimi no kao wo mitakattanda

1169
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:41,760
I wanted to see different faces of you

1170
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:40,775
Here I...

1171
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:42,850
...go!

1172
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:47,185
ooki na hitomi ga nakisou na koe ga

1173
01:20:47,285 --> 01:20:50,345
With big eyes and voice about to cry

1174
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:57,690
ima mo boku no mune wo shimetsukeru

1175
01:20:57,690 --> 01:21:04,045
surechigau hito no naka
de kimi wo oikaketa

1176
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:10,400
I was chasing you in a crowd of strangers

1177
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:12,765
All right, no talking.

1178
01:21:12,865 --> 01:21:12,800
kawaranai mono sagashiteita

1179
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:18,990
I was looking for unchanging things

1180
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:14,700
Who're you?

1181
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,040
No talking!

1182
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:16,460
I'm Tsuda, this is Konno.

1183
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,655
This is a transfer student,
Mamiya Chiaki-kun.

1184
01:21:18,755 --> 01:21:18,890
A girl?

1185
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:22,040
ano hi no kimi wo wasure wa shinai

1186
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,165
Not a product of well-breeding,
but let's get along.

1187
01:21:22,265 --> 01:21:24,265
Makoto, come here!

1188
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:24,955
See ya, Makoto.

1189
01:21:25,055 --> 01:21:24,990
toki wo koeteku omoi ga aru

1190
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:27,200
Some thoughts can cross the time

1191
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:30,955
Did you hear that? He used your first name.

1192
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:35,375
boku wa imasugu kimi ni aitai

1193
01:21:35,410 --> 01:21:39,580
I want to see you right now

1194
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:43,300
Makoto.

1195
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,600
Let's go out.

1196
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:49,670
From the "what if Kousuke got a girlfriend".

1197
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:53,200
I'm... not that ugly, right?

1198
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:37,510
Makoto?

1199
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:41,250
Are you okay?

1200
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:48,690
I wonder what Chiaki-kun
does on his days off.

1201
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:52,460
He can't play baseball all day long.

1202
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:58,050
Yuri.

1203
01:22:58,670 --> 01:23:00,160
You know, I...

1204
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:02,370
...have something I couldn't tell you.

1205
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:04,470
What is it?

1206
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:06,520
I...

1207
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:08,800
...like Chiaki.

1208
01:23:11,850 --> 01:23:13,850
Sorry.

1209
01:23:17,690 --> 01:23:18,960
I see.

1210
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,060
That's what I thought.

1211
01:23:21,890 --> 01:23:24,380
I passed him on my way here.

1212
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,120
Go.

1213
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:34,890
Makoto.

1214
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:37,340
Time waits for no one.

1215
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:40,540
Makoto!

1216
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:43,240
Kousuke?

1217
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:44,540
Where's Chiaki?

1218
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:47,230
Got tired of waiting and went to the field.

1219
01:23:47,330 --> 01:23:50,370
He's quite annoyed. We better go quick.

1220
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:53,505
You're leaving your girlfriend
alone? After all my effort...

1221
01:23:53,605 --> 01:23:54,930
Girlfriend? Whose?

1222
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:58,175
Oh, right! I went all the way back...

1223
01:23:58,175 --> 01:23:59,765
What are you talking about?

1224
01:23:59,865 --> 01:24:01,865
Um, that's...

1225
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:12,480
Say, why don't you invite
those girls to play with us?

1226
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,095
Go and invite them!

1227
01:24:14,195 --> 01:24:15,040
What for?

1228
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:18,050
Because it's more fun with more people.

1229
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:21,320
Do you know them?

1230
01:24:21,355 --> 01:24:22,560
Sort of.

1231
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:24,660
Also...

1232
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,310
If you want to use my bike, it'll be 5000 yen.

1233
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:30,480
Got it? Five thousand!

1234
01:24:30,515 --> 01:24:32,515
Hey, what do you mean?!

1235
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:36,630
Say "Let's play baseball
together", you hear me?

1236
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:39,400
And also...

1237
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,710
Thanks for waiting for me!

1238
01:24:44,190 --> 01:24:45,930
Makoto!

1239
01:24:46,030 --> 01:24:49,000
Look in front of you when you're running!

1240
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:51,100
Sure!

1241
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:13,185
You're late. Where's Kousuke?

1242
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,060
He's not coming.

1243
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:17,160
What's with him?

1244
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,480
Where did you find it?

1245
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:30,980
No... Do you know what it is?

1246
01:26:31,650 --> 01:26:33,510
I do.

1247
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:35,030
Who told you?

1248
01:26:35,130 --> 01:26:36,240
You did.

1249
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:38,130
I didn't!

1250
01:26:38,230 --> 01:26:40,100
I couldn't have!

1251
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,200
You told me everything.

1252
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:44,480
About the era you live in.

1253
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:46,720
About this device.

1254
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:48,130
Everything.

1255
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:50,230
H- Hey.

1256
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:52,820
Like I thought.

1257
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:54,400
I'm glad.

1258
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,500
Where are you from?

1259
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:58,260
From the future.

1260
01:26:58,360 --> 01:26:59,355
You can leap?

1261
01:26:59,455 --> 01:27:00,940
Not anymore.

1262
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,040
So I told you that?

1263
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:05,990
And you believed me?

1264
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:07,550
What a fool.

1265
01:27:07,650 --> 01:27:08,190
Maybe so.

1266
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:10,840
Did you come just to say that?

1267
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:20,750
Why did I talk... idiot.

1268
01:28:10,470 --> 01:28:14,720
The painting... you can
see it back in the future.

1269
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:18,110
It won't disappear or burn up.

1270
01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:23,425
It will still be there in your era.

1271
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:26,070
I'll make sure of it.

1272
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:30,280
I'm counting on you.

1273
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:37,550
I had to go back, but before
I noticed, it was summer.

1274
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:42,620
Being with you two was too much fun.

1275
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:48,250
That's not how you said it before.

1276
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:50,350
Then what'd I say?

1277
01:28:59,570 --> 01:29:01,570
I'm not telling.

1278
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:03,670
Why?

1279
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:06,640
Come on, what did I say?

1280
01:29:07,470 --> 01:29:08,750
Not telling.

1281
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:12,030
Tell me! I wanna know, yeah? Hey!

1282
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:15,490
It's a couple!

1283
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:17,590
A couple!

1284
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:19,440
Getting it on!

1285
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:20,520
Couple, couple!

1286
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:22,460
Shut up, idiots!

1287
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,560
Run away quick!

1288
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:39,900
Give my regards to Kousuke.

1289
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,400
And say I'm sorry I didn't do it myself.

1290
01:29:45,190 --> 01:29:47,190
And also...

1291
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:50,140
Makoto.

1292
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,880
What is it?

1293
01:29:56,210 --> 01:30:00,715
There's something I've wanted
to say for a long time.

1294
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:05,640
You...

1295
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:12,845
Make sure you don't get hurt
when you're racing around.

1296
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:18,930
You know, you've got a
short attention span.

1297
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:22,090
Think some more before acting, okay?

1298
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,330
What the heck.

1299
01:30:24,430 --> 01:30:26,810
That's all you have to say in the end?!

1300
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:29,375
Idiot, I'm worried, you know.

1301
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:36,775
Fine! Thank you so much
for worrying about me!

1302
01:30:36,875 --> 01:30:38,627
So hurry up and go!

1303
01:30:38,727 --> 01:30:40,445
What are you mad about?

1304
01:30:40,545 --> 01:30:42,545
Go, I said!

1305
01:30:43,690 --> 01:30:45,290
See ya.

1306
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:47,390
See ya!

1307
01:31:22,370 --> 01:31:24,370
Why is that?

1308
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:02,090
I'll be waiting in the future.

1309
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:11,290
I'll be right there. I'll run there.

1310
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:45,580
Makoto.

1311
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,880
Makoto!

1312
01:32:50,090 --> 01:32:52,120
Hey, Makoto!

1313
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:05,940
Really, what's going on?

1314
01:33:06,230 --> 01:33:09,310
Forget me... He didn't at least let you know?

1315
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:13,850
And he's leaving school to
study abroad all of a sudden?

1316
01:33:13,950 --> 01:33:15,950
Don't make me laugh!

1317
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
I'm sorry!

1318
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:23,480
Kaho, it's okay.

1319
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:27,060
He probably decided on
what he wanted to do.

1320
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:29,220
Did you hear something?

1321
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:30,960
Not really.

1322
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:33,060
Nothing.

1323
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:35,220
There!

1324
01:33:36,270 --> 01:33:37,070
Sorry!

1325
01:33:37,170 --> 01:33:39,365
Kaho, you have no strength at all.

1326
01:33:39,465 --> 01:33:40,860
Good grief.

1327
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:45,040
I also decided on what
I'm going to do from now.

1328
01:33:45,210 --> 01:33:46,190
What?

1329
01:33:46,290 --> 01:33:48,290
Secret.

1330
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:51,390
What's that?

1331
01:33:52,030 --> 01:33:54,030
Maybe later.

1332
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:31,680
Konno-senpai!

1333
01:34:31,715 --> 01:34:33,715
Yeah!

1334
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
There!

1335
01:34:38,660 --> 01:34:40,660
Nice throw!

1336
01:34:41,650 --> 01:34:43,650
