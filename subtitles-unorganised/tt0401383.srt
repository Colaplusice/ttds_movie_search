1
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:33,656
THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY

2
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:17,778
Look! He's waking
- Page Dr. Cocheton. Quickly. 

3
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:19,864
Dr. Cocheton to room 119, please

4
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:23,537
Mr Bauby, open your eyes.
Open your eyes.

5
00:02:24,707 --> 00:02:27,346
Mr Bauby, open your eyes.

6
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:32,420
You've been asleep for a long time, 
you're waking up now. 
Can you hear me?

7
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:33,940
<i>Yes, I'm hearing you.</i>

8
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:38,981
<i>What's happening?</i>

9
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,419
<i>Jesus, a hospital.</i>

10
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:48,021
Mr Bauby, open your eyes wide.

11
00:02:50,507 --> 00:02:52,498
Try to keep them open.

12
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:57,219
Yes, like that.
Follow this lamp with your eyes.

13
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:04,581
Alright.

14
00:03:06,427 --> 00:03:09,942
Don't be alarmed. 
You're in a hospital. 

15
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:15,819
I'm a doctor. My name's Cocheton.
These are nurses. 

16
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:18,897
We're here to take care of you. 

17
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,137
Do you remember what happened?

18
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:26,657
Do you remember what happened?

19
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:30,576
<i>Just vague images</i>

20
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:41,379
You're in the Naval Hospital, Berck-sur-Mer. 
On the coast. At Calais.

21
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:45,626
You were treated first in Paris, 
and then brought here. 

22
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:47,658
Do you remember that? 

23
00:03:49,347 --> 00:03:50,496
Jean-Dominique.

24
00:03:51,907 --> 00:03:53,625
You've had a stroke.

25
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:56,819
You've been in a coma for almost three weeks.

26
00:03:57,027 --> 00:04:00,656
But now you're waking up and you'll be fine.

27
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,341
I promise you.

28
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:07,979
<i>Thank you</i>
- I have to give you some simple tests.

29
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:10,779
Keep your eyes on me. 

30
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:13,306
Good.

31
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:18,464
Follow my finger. Good.

32
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:28,256
When I say blink, please blink. 

33
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:34,456
Excellent.

34
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,376
Now, tell me your name. 

35
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:44,656
<i>Jean-Dominique Bauby.</i>
- Come on, try

36
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:48,462
<i>I just did.</i>
- Try really hard, say your name.

37
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,736
<i>Jean-Dominique Bauby.</i>

38
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:53,701
Try saying your children's names.

39
00:04:55,387 --> 00:04:58,618
<i>Thophile, Cleste, Hortense.</i>

40
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:03,822
Don't worry. 

41
00:05:04,027 --> 00:05:08,498
It's a slow process.
But your speech will come back. 

42
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:13,303
<i>What? Can't you hear me, doctor?
Doctor?</i>

43
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:16,658
<i>What's happening? I can't speak.</i>

44
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:19,984
<i>They can't hear me.
Oh my God.</i>

45
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:22,979
<i>I can't speak.</i>

46
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:25,382
<i>What's happened to me?</i>

47
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:30,020
<i>My name is Jean-Dominique Bauby.</i>

48
00:05:30,227 --> 00:05:31,182
<i>Doctor?</i>

49
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,659
<i>All right, all right.</i>

50
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:39,301
<i>I've had a stroke
my speech'll come back
my memory will come back</i>

51
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:43,705
Everything will be alright, Mr Bauby.
We are here to care for you.

52
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:45,619
<i>I'll be patient.</i>

53
00:05:47,187 --> 00:05:48,666
<i>Ok.</i>

54
00:05:49,507 --> 00:05:51,304
<i>Ok, I believe you.</i>

55
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:05,586
<i>Who brought these flowers?</i>

56
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,625
<i>Roses.</i>

57
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:13,423
 

58
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:25,306
<i>Ins.</i>

59
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:40,697
Did you sleep well?

60
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:45,665
Let's see.

61
00:06:56,147 --> 00:07:00,504
You're going to have an important visitor. 
Dr. Lepage, your neurologist.

62
00:07:00,707 --> 00:07:02,345
So we want you at your very best.

63
00:07:29,307 --> 00:07:30,979
Good morning.

64
00:07:31,787 --> 00:07:35,257
I'm Alain Lepage, your neurologist.
You know Dr. Cocheton, of course.

65
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:38,379
Jean-Dominique...
no, no, your friends call you Jean-Do.

66
00:07:38,587 --> 00:07:41,863
So that's what I'm going to call you. 
Think of me as your friend.

67
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:43,500
<i>Sure Doctor.</i>

68
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:48,223
As a friend I know how difficult this is for you.

69
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:55,385
Nobody here has explained to 
you the full extent of your condition.

70
00:07:56,827 --> 00:08:01,696
You've had what we call a cerebrovascular accident.

71
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,540
It's put your brain stem out of action. 

72
00:08:05,747 --> 00:08:11,504
The brain stem is an essential 
component of our internal computer

73
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:14,665
the link between the brain and the spinal cord.

74
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:19,895
In the past, we would have said you'd had a massive 
stroke. You would very probably have died.

75
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:26,580
But now we have such improved resuscitation techniques 

76
00:08:26,787 --> 00:08:28,903
that we're able to prolong life.

77
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:30,665
<i>Is this life? </i>

78
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:34,381
<i>Is this life? 
- Yes, prolong life.</i>

79
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:42,137
I'm not going to mince words,
Jean-Do. You are completely paralyzed.

80
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:48,616
You have realised you are unable to speak. 

81
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:53,577
You have what we call...

82
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:57,777
...'locked-in syndrome'.

83
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:03,218
<i>locked-in syndrome.
- Locked-in syndrome.</i>

84
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:11,505
It will be of no comfort to you but your 
condition is extremely rare. 

85
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:14,426
And we simply don't know the cause. 

86
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:16,982
You don't smoke and you're not a heavy drinker. 

87
00:09:17,187 --> 00:09:19,826
It just happened all of a sudden.

88
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:25,499
However, apart from being totally 
paralysed ...

89
00:09:25,707 --> 00:09:28,505
...you are normal in every other respect.

90
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:30,345
<i>Normal?</i>
- There is hope.

91
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:34,217
Your brain is functioning. 

92
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:39,022
You're able to understand us. 
You follow our movements with your eyes. 

93
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:41,946
Although I'm not entirely 
happy with your right eye.

94
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:47,659
This muscle doesn't work, see?

95
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:51,546
The eye doesn't get moistured.

96
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,504
I'm afraid we have to cover that.

97
00:09:56,707 --> 00:09:58,345
<i>Don't we?
- Cover?</i>

98
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:02,857
<i>What does he want to cover?
- but I'll take a second guess on that.</i>

99
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:09,781
We want you to take it easy for a few days.

100
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:14,378
<i>What d'you think I'm doing now?
- and then two beautiful young women will visit you.</i>

101
00:10:14,587 --> 00:10:19,183
<i>Awhen I say beautiful, I mean beautiful.
- Fine.</i>

102
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:24,415
They are great. Outstanding therapists and  
miracle workers.

103
00:10:24,627 --> 00:10:28,859
<i>No miracles please.
- And so, as I say, there's hope..</i>

104
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:31,385
<i>That's what you all showed me.</i>

105
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:34,181
You'll be well looked after, Jean-Do. Really.

106
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:37,345
<i>That's a good start.
- You'll be well looked after.</i>

107
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:30,660
Good morning.

108
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:40,581
<i>Have I gone to heaven?
- I'm Henritte.</i>

109
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:45,019
And I'm Marie.
- You can blink your eyes, don't you?

110
00:11:45,227 --> 00:11:48,617
So, I want you to blink once for yes, 
twice for no. 

111
00:11:49,747 --> 00:11:54,298
<i>Fine! Two beauties and I'm helpless.
- Can you read that?</i>

112
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:55,622
<i>Where?</i>

113
00:11:55,827 --> 00:11:59,866
H. Durand, logopediste.
- Can you see Durand?

114
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:02,023
<i>Good, Mr Bauby.
- Mrs or Miss?</i>

115
00:12:02,227 --> 00:12:05,776
I'm your physiotherapist.
First you have to learn again to swallow.

116
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:09,343
So I'll be working on your tongue and lips.

117
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:11,936
<i>Sounds fun.
- And I'm your speech therapist.</i>

118
00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:17,016
Until you can actually speak again 
I have to find a way for you to communicate.

119
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:20,060
<i>Your condition is extremely rare.
- I know.</i>

120
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:24,340
we're going to have to work very hard.
- So we'd better get started.

121
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:29,063
Exactly. I just came in to introduce myself.
See you.

122
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:31,899
<i>See you.</i>

123
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:43,064
I want you to know...

124
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:47,703
...that this is perhaps the most important 
job I've ever been given.

125
00:12:47,907 --> 00:12:52,139
and I'm determined to succeed. 
With your help, of course.

126
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:59,336
I think you understand,
but I will ask you some questions.

127
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:01,780
Ok?

128
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:06,179
Remember, you answer by blinking once for yes 
or twice for no..

129
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:10,775
Am I a man? 

130
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:13,386
Am I a woman? 

131
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:18,104
Is the sun too bright for you?

132
00:13:20,987 --> 00:13:22,261
Is it midnight now? 

133
00:13:22,987 --> 00:13:26,263
<i>What kinds of questions are this?
- Are we in Paris?</i>

134
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:30,101
Are we in Berck?

135
00:13:31,147 --> 00:13:34,503
<i>Does wood float?
- I don't think so.</i>

136
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,736
Do you remember having your stroke?

137
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:41,906
<i>Were you the editor of Elle magazine?</i>

138
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:45,664
<i>Yes, I was the editor-in-chief of Elle.</i>

139
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:47,986
To Alaa.

140
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,665
Your right eye isn't working properly.

141
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,744
Can you hear me?

142
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:31,383
Your right eye isn't working properly.,
I'm going to sew it up.

143
00:14:33,027 --> 00:14:35,416
<i>Sew it up?
- That happens...</i>

144
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:39,301
...an ulcerated cornea.

145
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:45,900
I've been skiing in St. Moritz.
It's wonderful there now.

146
00:14:46,107 --> 00:14:47,745
<i>I don't give a shit.</i>

147
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:51,986
nothing like sailing down a slope 
with the wind in your face..

148
00:14:52,187 --> 00:14:53,745
<i>Keep away from me</i>

149
00:14:53,947 --> 00:14:56,381
<i>Don't worry
- keep away from me</i>

150
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:59,465
<i>You won't feel a thing.
- Please.</i>

151
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:03,899
<i>No, please don't ...
- You won't feel anything. Just be quiet.</i>

152
00:15:04,107 --> 00:15:09,261
<i>Don't</i>

153
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:12,821
I've done this dozens of times.

154
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:16,535
It will be fine.

155
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:26,425
Don't worry.

156
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:30,381
Almost done.
A few more pinpricks.

157
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:34,375
Perfect, even if I say so m yself.

158
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,341
Done.

159
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:47,585
We're going to dress you to cheer you up a bit.

160
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,022
Afterwards we have a surprise.

161
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:19,221
We're going to try 
you in this wheelchair.

162
00:16:24,387 --> 00:16:26,105
Ok.

163
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:31,424
Wheel him up and down, will you? 

164
00:16:32,547 --> 00:16:36,699
These are my students. Pay no attention to them. 

165
00:16:36,907 --> 00:16:41,185
I want to be sure that sitting like that won't 
trigger uncontrollable muscular spasms. 

166
00:16:42,387 --> 00:16:43,945
He needs a cushion behind his head

167
00:16:44,147 --> 00:16:49,016
Sorry we have to do this to you, Jean-Do. 
Excellent. Excellent.

168
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:51,946
You can handle the wheelchair. 

169
00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:55,617
<i>You can handle the wheelchair. What an honor.</i>
- That is good news.

170
00:16:56,907 --> 00:16:58,704
And now for the surprise

171
00:17:11,427 --> 00:17:14,385
<i>Oh my God, who's that? Me?</i>

172
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:20,460
<i>I look as if I've emerged from a vat 
of formaldehyde.</i>

173
00:17:22,147 --> 00:17:23,375
<i>Horrible.</i>

174
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:28,384
<i>Is that my surprise? To see myself?</i>

175
00:17:41,947 --> 00:17:43,096
<i>Cline.</i>

176
00:17:50,907 --> 00:17:54,377
How are you?
Ok, let me explain that.

177
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:59,505
Isn't this a wonderful surprise, Jean-Do? 
Your first visitor is your wife. 

178
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:05,703
<i>No, she's the mother of my children.</i>
- He understands everything. Everything.

179
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:10,621
If you ask a question, make it a yes-or-no question. Ok?

180
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:14,820
He'll blink. One for yes, two for no.

181
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:16,340
Ok.

182
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:22,497
One more thing. Stay in front of him
when you talk to him. Ok?

183
00:18:22,707 --> 00:18:26,620
If you stand here, he can't see you, and here neither. 

184
00:18:26,827 --> 00:18:29,899
Talk to him like this.
Right, Jean-Do?

185
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:34,146
I'll leave you. I'm sure you have a lot 
to say to each other...

186
00:18:53,707 --> 00:18:56,175
They tell me you're doing...

187
00:18:59,027 --> 00:19:02,736
Everyone sends their love. 
And their prayers.

188
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:06,383
I didn't bring the children.

189
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:08,859
I thought I should see you first.

190
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:13,145
They're both well. They miss you.

191
00:19:14,307 --> 00:19:16,821
Celeste prays for you every night. 

192
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:22,545
Do you want me to bring them?

193
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:26,106
Don't you want to see them?

194
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,140
Laurent wants to visit. Do you want to see him?

195
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:40,706
Him you want to see.

196
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:44,019
I'll tell him.

197
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:07,903
Has she been to see you? 

198
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,576
I've met the speech therapist. I like her. 

199
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:21,577
 She thinks she can help you.

200
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:34,618
Please don't cry. 

201
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:45,740
<i>I know Berck station. I can see her now.</i>

202
00:20:45,947 --> 00:20:48,381
<i>It's the most depressing place in the world.</i>

203
00:20:48,587 --> 00:20:52,978
<i>Well, it certainly was when I had my 
holidays here as a child.</i>

204
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:55,860
<i>Berck. The end of summer. </i>

205
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:58,985
<i> Waiting with my father for the Paris train.</i>

206
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:03,419
<i>It was desolate then and it'll be 
more desolate now.</i>

207
00:21:05,147 --> 00:21:09,379
<i>I treated her so badly. And the children, too.</i>

208
00:21:11,427 --> 00:21:15,386
<i>And now I will never be able to make amends.</i>

209
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:18,700
<i>Never.</i>

210
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:20,266
Look at this.

211
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:26,143
As you can see, it's not the alphabet we learned at school.

212
00:21:26,347 --> 00:21:30,659
These letters are presented in order of usage frequency.
Do you understand?

213
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:36,343
E, S, A, R, I, N...

214
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:40,342
Usage frequency?

215
00:21:45,427 --> 00:21:48,544
I've talked to a host of colleagues ...

216
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:50,942
...and I think I've come up with a viable system.

217
00:21:51,147 --> 00:21:53,103
<i>Good for you.</i>
- This is how it works.

218
00:21:53,307 --> 00:21:57,903
You think of something to say.
When you're ready, blink.

219
00:21:58,827 --> 00:22:03,184
I'll recite this alphabet, very slowly, letter by letter.

220
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:06,424
When I get to the first letter of your word, blink.

221
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:11,417
I'll write it down, letter for letter,
and so on.

222
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:14,585
In that way we'll form words and sentences.

223
00:22:14,787 --> 00:22:18,621
Two other things: blink twice when the word is formed.

224
00:22:18,827 --> 00:22:23,981
As if you're hitting the space bar on a keyboard.
And blink rapidly if we make a mistake.

225
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:29,026
I know it sounds terribly arduous but, 
believe me, we'll become expert very quickly. 

226
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:32,856
And your friends and family can use it, too.

227
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:36,343
Are you ready for this?
Look at me.

228
00:22:37,587 --> 00:22:41,944
Do you want to try7
Have you thought of something you want to say? 

229
00:22:42,147 --> 00:22:43,739
Good.

230
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,097
So, let's begin.
<i>- Wait, no...</i>

231
00:22:47,547 --> 00:22:49,856
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>
- E.

232
00:22:50,907 --> 00:22:54,616
Is E the first letter?
<i>- No.</i>

233
00:22:54,827 --> 00:22:58,979
E is not the first letter.
<i>- I don't know what to say.</i>

234
00:22:59,187 --> 00:23:02,657
It's difficult, I know, so let's go slowly.

235
00:23:04,347 --> 00:23:07,578
E, S, A...

236
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:16,745
<i>That's too slow.</i>

237
00:23:17,947 --> 00:23:22,816
<i>I can't keep my eyelids open that long. 
Get cracking!</i>

238
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,022
<i>I...</i>

239
00:23:28,827 --> 00:23:30,738
<i>I?</i>
- Good.

240
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:34,464
Is I the first word?

241
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:38,137
My first word is I.
i begin with myself.

242
00:23:38,347 --> 00:23:39,541
E, S...

243
00:23:40,427 --> 00:23:41,655
S?

244
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:43,858
<i>No.
- No?</i>

245
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:46,786
Not S.
- That was too fast.

246
00:23:50,747 --> 00:23:54,422
<i>It doesn't work. This is a nightmare. It'll never work.</i>

247
00:23:54,627 --> 00:23:56,185
Shall we go on?

248
00:23:57,027 --> 00:23:58,858
<i>I've had enough.</i>

249
00:24:04,187 --> 00:24:06,018
<i>Leave me alone.</i>

250
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:33,857
<i>Up, down, up.</i>

251
00:24:35,147 --> 00:24:36,865
<i>Under my arms.</i>

252
00:24:38,147 --> 00:24:40,377
<i>The back of my legs.</i>

253
00:24:41,387 --> 00:24:43,503
<i>'m forty-two years old...</i>

254
00:24:44,507 --> 00:24:47,340
<i>...and I'm being handled like a big baby.</i>

255
00:24:49,427 --> 00:24:53,261
<i>my private parts wiped and swaddled.</i>

256
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:56,903
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>

257
00:24:58,587 --> 00:25:00,896
<i>But as the poet says:</i>

258
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:03,940
<i>only a fool laughs when there's nothing to laugh at.</i>

259
00:25:05,627 --> 00:25:07,583
Blow me a kiss.

260
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:09,982
Come on.

261
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:13,060
Try it.

262
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:19,421
Come on.

263
00:25:21,547 --> 00:25:22,616
Try.

264
00:25:23,827 --> 00:25:25,943
It's difficult.
<i>- No mirror.</i>

265
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:29,258
<i>But that's what I want you to work at.
- Not that face.</i>qw

266
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:35,542
When you're resting or watching TV, or any time at all, 
I want you to work at blowing me a kiss.  

267
00:25:35,747 --> 00:25:37,260
<i>Okay?
- Okay.</i>

268
00:25:37,987 --> 00:25:40,945
And one other thing you have 
to practise as much as possible. 

269
00:25:41,227 --> 00:25:45,300
And that's sliding your tongue 
to the back of your palate.

270
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:50,499
That's how you'll learn to swallow again. Watch.

271
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:59,020
<i>This just isn't fair. Not fair.</i>

272
00:26:06,827 --> 00:26:09,899
You try it. 
<i>- Put that mirror away.</i>

273
00:26:10,947 --> 00:26:12,539
Open your mouth.

274
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:15,335
Good.

275
00:26:15,547 --> 00:26:18,744
Try sliding your tongue backwards. 

276
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:24,535
<i>I can't.</i>
- Try, go on.

277
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:26,743
<i>I can't.</i>

278
00:26:26,947 --> 00:26:29,222
Good! You moved your tongue.

279
00:26:29,427 --> 00:26:33,181
<i>Don't make a fool of me.
- Very good. Again.</i>

280
00:26:35,787 --> 00:26:40,019
<i>Unbelievable. Good.
- Yes, but true.</i>

281
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:48,664
I'll help you to move your head on your own.
Like that.

282
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:54,219
<i>You're doing it all.
- Left.</i>

283
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,546
Good.

284
00:26:57,187 --> 00:26:59,940
Right. Good.

285
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:03,819
Left again.

286
00:27:14,587 --> 00:27:17,545
Can you feel my hands on your face?

287
00:27:17,747 --> 00:27:19,305
<i>No.</i>

288
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:22,340
Never mind, you will, you will.

289
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:28,745
We're all very sorry for what's happened to you.

290
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:33,816
I'm a regular reader of Elle. I love it.

291
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:38,417
I just wish all the models didn't look like boys.

292
00:27:43,387 --> 00:27:46,618
<i>I don't think so.
- They're getting thinner and thinner.</i>

293
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,585
An odd fashion.

294
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:53,303
<i>How beautiful she is.</i>

295
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:59,260
I have a strong faith. 
I pray for you every day.

296
00:28:02,107 --> 00:28:06,385
He can only see with his right eye.
Look straight at him when you talk.

297
00:28:06,547 --> 00:28:07,662
<i>Who is that?</i>

298
00:28:12,747 --> 00:28:14,385
<i>Pierre Roussin.</i>

299
00:28:17,787 --> 00:28:21,063
Do you remember me?
<i>- Of course.</i>

300
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:24,782
<i>He blinks once for yes....
- Damn, I didn't call him back.</i>

301
00:28:24,987 --> 00:28:28,104
<i>Do you want me to leave? 
- No, please not.</i>

302
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,980
<i>Why didn't I call him back?</i>

303
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:34,577
I heard what happened to you. And I just 
wanted...

304
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:40,536
I was compelled to come and see you 
because of what happened to me.

305
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:47,266
In a way, I know what you're going through

306
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:55,023
Being taken hostage is not so different 
from what you're going through, 

307
00:28:56,347 --> 00:28:58,099
Am I right?
<i>- Hostage? </i>

308
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:04,377
Jean-Dominique was kind enough to give me his seat on a flight

309
00:29:04,587 --> 00:29:10,696
The plane was high-jacked and I remained 
a hostage in Beirut for four years

310
00:29:11,827 --> 00:29:15,820
Four years, four months, two weeks, five days 
and seven hours.

311
00:29:16,707 --> 00:29:21,462
They kept me in a cellar. Very small. Dark. 

312
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:23,544
It was hard to breathe.

313
00:29:24,947 --> 00:29:27,097
I called it my tomb.

314
00:29:30,347 --> 00:29:35,944
<i>I know, a lot about wines. 
- What happened to his hand?</i>

315
00:29:36,147 --> 00:29:42,302
I used to recite aloud the wines of the 
Bordeaux classification of 1855.

316
00:29:43,587 --> 00:29:48,536
Chteau Margaux, Margaux.
Chteau Lafite Rotschild, Pauillac.

317
00:29:52,107 --> 00:29:56,100
That's what preserved my sanity. 

318
00:29:59,947 --> 00:30:06,546
Most times, I was in despair.
Suicidal. Angry.

319
00:30:09,227 --> 00:30:13,140
The beatings, the filth, the cruelty.

320
00:30:13,347 --> 00:30:16,464
But the worst was the waiting.

321
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:19,425
I survived.

322
00:30:21,467 --> 00:30:26,143
I survived, because I held fast to my own humanity.

323
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:34,779
That's all I could do because that's all I had, 
just like you. 

324
00:30:38,907 --> 00:30:45,176
Cling to your own humanity and you'll survive. 

325
00:30:46,147 --> 00:30:50,823
<i>Humanity? Easy.
- I just had to say that to you in person. </i>

326
00:30:51,787 --> 00:30:56,383
<i>Why didn't I call him, when he was back from Beirut?</i>

327
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:58,225
<i>I felt too guilty.</i>

328
00:30:58,427 --> 00:31:02,181
<i>It's ridiculous...
- It's not. I feel ashamed.</i>

329
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:15,702
I?

330
00:31:17,187 --> 00:31:18,540
W?

331
00:31:19,787 --> 00:31:20,742
I want?

332
00:31:22,267 --> 00:31:23,985
What do you want, Mr Bauby?

333
00:31:34,587 --> 00:31:35,861
D.

334
00:31:45,107 --> 00:31:46,335
I.

335
00:31:56,307 --> 00:31:57,296
E.

336
00:32:02,227 --> 00:32:04,502
Die.

337
00:32:05,547 --> 00:32:07,185
You want to die?

338
00:32:09,547 --> 00:32:11,265
How dare you!

339
00:32:14,827 --> 00:32:18,456
There are people who love you and care for you.

340
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:21,943
I hardly know you and yet I'm there for you.

341
00:32:22,147 --> 00:32:24,900
And you're alive. 
So, don't say you want to die.

342
00:32:25,107 --> 00:32:27,223
It's offensive and obscene.

343
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,459
You want to continue? 

344
00:32:36,227 --> 00:32:37,865
Alright.

345
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:41,183
I'll come back another time and see 
if you've changed your mind.

346
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,703
I'm sorry.

347
00:33:15,387 --> 00:33:18,265
<i>Why?</i>
- I went too far.

348
00:33:22,347 --> 00:33:23,939
Rest yourself.

349
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:41,901
Do you like it?
I didn't really know what to bring.

350
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:44,382
Look, I also brought this.

351
00:33:45,187 --> 00:33:47,860
<i>One moment.
- What are you doing?</i>

352
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,058
<i>What is that?</i>

353
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:54,543
<i>That's not true.
This makes me look like a rabbit.</i>

354
00:33:56,587 --> 00:33:59,943
I just read the letters and you blink, 
is that ok?

355
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:01,739
<i>Let it be.
- Ok?</i>

356
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:09,135
<i>S of A?
- As you want it.</i>

357
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:13,260
<i>A.
- Good then A.</i>

358
00:34:20,147 --> 00:34:21,102
N?

359
00:34:22,347 --> 00:34:23,860
<i>Good, N.</i>

360
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:27,066
<i>Anne.</i>

361
00:34:30,587 --> 00:34:32,862
<i>You have to look at me, Laurent.</i>

362
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:37,982
Shit, I forgot to look at you. 
Sorry, I'll start again and slow down.

363
00:34:38,147 --> 00:34:40,297
<i>As you like it...</i>

364
00:34:47,747 --> 00:34:49,066
<i>Funny.</i>

365
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:52,225
I've never been a good hospital visitor.

366
00:34:52,387 --> 00:34:55,743
<i>I'm the sort who brings food and then eats it.
- That's not true.</i>

367
00:34:55,907 --> 00:34:57,579
Why did that have to happen to you?

368
00:34:57,787 --> 00:35:01,177
Everybody's talking about it. 
I was in Cafe de Flore last night...

369
00:35:01,347 --> 00:35:06,705
...I heard someone say, 'Did you know that 
Jean-Do Bauby is now a complete vegetable?'

370
00:35:06,867 --> 00:35:08,983
<i>Vegetable.
- He can't see you.</i>

371
00:35:09,147 --> 00:35:11,741
<i>Who said that?</i>

372
00:35:11,907 --> 00:35:16,822
<i>And what sort of vegetable?
A carrot, a potato, a pickled cucumber?</i>

373
00:36:29,907 --> 00:36:34,662
<i>Today it seems to me that my whole life 
was nothing but a string of failures.</i>

374
00:36:36,507 --> 00:36:41,422
<i>the women I was unable to love, 
the chances I failed to seize...</i>

375
00:36:41,627 --> 00:36:45,506
<i>...the moments of happiness I allowed to drift away...</i>

376
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:48,386
<i>A race whose result you know
beforehand  ...</i>

377
00:36:48,547 --> 00:36:51,459
<i>...but in which you fail to bet on 
the winner.</i>

378
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:55,703
<i>Have I been blind or stupid?</i>

379
00:36:55,907 --> 00:37:00,139
<i>Or does it take the harsh light of disaster
to to show a person their true nature?</i>

380
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:10,859
I'm still here.

381
00:37:14,787 --> 00:37:17,017
Would you like me to work with you today?

382
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:24,302
Good.

383
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:28,306
We're going to master this.

384
00:37:28,467 --> 00:37:30,697
<i>Do you agree?
- Yes, mistress.</i>

385
00:37:30,867 --> 00:37:32,266
Ok.

386
00:37:33,187 --> 00:37:34,700
I'll begin.

387
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:48,702
T?

388
00:37:51,427 --> 00:37:52,382
H?

389
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:57,895
A?

390
00:38:05,027 --> 00:38:07,541
K? Thank you.

391
00:38:08,467 --> 00:38:10,105
Thank you?

392
00:38:10,947 --> 00:38:12,539
Thank you.

393
00:38:13,467 --> 00:38:16,345
<i>May I call you Jean-Do?
- Women are not complicated.</i>

394
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:18,139
Thank you, Jean-Do.

395
00:38:29,747 --> 00:38:31,066
I?

396
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:37,658
I have?

397
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:42,065
<i>I have decided not feel sorry for myself again.</i>

398
00:38:46,187 --> 00:38:50,465
<i>Apart from my eyes, there two more 
things that aren't paralysed.</i>

399
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,345
<i>My imagination...</i>

400
00:38:54,947 --> 00:38:56,426
<i>...and my memory.</i>

401
00:39:09,907 --> 00:39:15,106
<i>My imagination and my memory are the 
only way l can escape my diving bell.</i>

402
00:39:39,387 --> 00:39:43,699
<i>I can imagine anything, anyone, anywhere</i>

403
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:53,745
<i>I let the sea wash over me on the isle of Martinique.</i>

404
00:39:54,107 --> 00:39:56,462
<i>Visit the women I love.</i>

405
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:10,897
<i>Bow before Ozym andias, king of kings.</i>

406
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:18,415
<i>I can imagine anything.</i>

407
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:24,945
<i>As a child I dreamed of my abilities as an adult.</i>

408
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:27,786
<i>Now I want to remember myself as I was.</i>

409
00:40:27,987 --> 00:40:32,503
<i>Handsome, debonair, glamorous. 
And devilishly attractive</i>

410
00:40:32,707 --> 00:40:37,906
<i>Yes, glamorous and handsome, some people said.
That's not me, that's Marlon Brando.</i>

411
00:40:38,747 --> 00:40:40,260
<i>That's me.</i>

412
00:41:12,307 --> 00:41:16,220
<i>Is this Betty Mialet? 
- Yes, this is she. </i>

413
00:41:16,427 --> 00:41:21,421
My name is Henritte Durand. I'm a therapist 
at Berck-sur-Mer Naval Hospital.

414
00:41:21,587 --> 00:41:25,466
I'm calling on behalf of one of my patients, 
Jean-Dominique Bauby. 

415
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:28,386
Jean-Do? How is he? 

416
00:41:29,107 --> 00:41:32,383
Comfortable but...
- I heard he's completely paralyzed.

417
00:41:32,587 --> 00:41:37,138
<i>That he can't communicate with anybody.
- That's not absolutely accurate.</i>

418
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:39,822
Come in.

419
00:41:40,027 --> 00:41:44,305
<i>He wants me to ask you for a favour.</i>

420
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:46,662
Of course. Can you wait a minute?

421
00:41:47,587 --> 00:41:48,906
<i>Anything.</i>

422
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:52,224
He says he has a contract with you for a book.

423
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:55,146
He said that? He can speak, I thought he 
couldn't speak.

424
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:59,579
He can. In a way. I'll explain later.

425
00:41:59,787 --> 00:42:04,144
About this book ...
- Yes, he's got a contract with us,

426
00:42:04,347 --> 00:42:08,135
<i>but now, given the circumstances...
- He wants to fulfill it.</i>

427
00:42:08,347 --> 00:42:12,977
<i>He wants to write the book. 
- You can't be serious?</i>

428
00:42:14,467 --> 00:42:16,981
Let me assure you, he can.

429
00:42:17,187 --> 00:42:23,899
but do you think you can 
find someone to take his dictation?

430
00:42:24,107 --> 00:42:25,665
Someone who's patient.

431
00:42:26,787 --> 00:42:32,339
<i>Somebody with a lot of time.
Someone special.</i>

432
00:42:32,547 --> 00:42:35,505
Yes, I understand. I'll get back to you.

433
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:40,104
Betty Mialet said Claude Mendibil was sent from heaven. 

434
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,696
She said no one could be more perfect for this.

435
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:46,502
Betty always exaggerates. 
I will have to practise with Henritte.

436
00:42:46,707 --> 00:42:48,823
Any time.

437
00:42:49,787 --> 00:42:51,220
He wants to say something.

438
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:01,060
No?

439
00:43:15,347 --> 00:43:17,178
No panic.

440
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:26,018
Claude has taken a room in a hotel. 
Perhaps you ought to discuss a routine.

441
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:32,257
<i>The nurses wake me at five a.m. 
I'll think of what I want to write.</i>

442
00:43:32,467 --> 00:43:36,779
<i>You can come at eight
then I'll dictate it to you.</i>

443
00:43:37,507 --> 00:43:42,706
<i>Good. I'll do my best for you.
- I know you will.</i>

444
00:43:42,907 --> 00:43:46,183
<i>Can we begin tomorrow? ?
- Of course.</i>

445
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:19,746
<i>Through?
- Through the frayed curtain of my window...</i>

446
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:23,217
<i>...a wan glow announces the break of day.</i>

447
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:26,863
<i>My heels hurt, my head weighs a ton</i>

448
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:31,185
<i>my whole body is encased in a kind of diving suit.</i>

449
00:44:31,387 --> 00:44:34,902
<i>My task now is to write the motionless travel notes...</i>

450
00:44:35,107 --> 00:44:38,463
<i>...from a castaway on the shores of loneliness.</i>

451
00:44:39,347 --> 00:44:44,819
<i>This Naval Hospital has in its time been a 
home to children with tuberculosis</i>

452
00:44:46,147 --> 00:44:49,298
<i>In the hall, there's a white marble bust...</i>

453
00:44:49,507 --> 00:44:52,943
<i>...of Empress Eugnie, the wife of Napoleon III...</i>

454
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:57,100
<i>...the hospital's patroness.
She came here regularly.</i>

455
00:44:57,307 --> 00:45:01,983
<i>There was a fat farm, a school and a place where</i>

456
00:45:02,187 --> 00:45:05,065
<i>...the great Diaghilev rehearsed his Ballet Russe. .</i>

457
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:11,058
<i>They say it was here that Nijinsky leapt 
twelve feet into the air.</i>

458
00:45:13,867 --> 00:45:16,335
<i>No one here now leaps into the air.</i>

459
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:23,066
<i>These days they are all elderly, enfeebled 
or, like me, rigid and mute.</i>

460
00:45:23,227 --> 00:45:25,297
<i>A battalion of cripples.</i>

461
00:45:28,507 --> 00:45:32,056
<i>But I like being wheeled to the 
place I call Cinecitta.</i>

462
00:45:32,267 --> 00:45:35,577
<i>A perpetually deserted terrace, a vast series 
of balconies that open onto a landscape...</i>

463

A man. I think. 
- He winked at you.

We're from Telecom France.

We'll let people know you've got a phone now. 
They'll have to book a time for their calls. 


497
00:48:46,467 --> 00:48:48,822
We'll make sure someone's with you.

- Don't talk about him as if he weren't here. 

499

Ask him. 

500

speak what's he want a phone for? 

501
00:49:05,347 --> 00:49:07,542
Perhaps he's a heavy breather.

How's the tongue? 
- I'll open your mouth.

517

The tongue moves

518
00:50:35,267 --> 00:50:39,977
Then we can go further with his speech.
- The movement of the tongue is crucial so there's hope.

You shaving me.

Why?
- Because I'm thinking of writing a modern version.

<i>Of the Count of Monte Cristo? 
- Yes.</i>

Cristo will be a woman.

- Yes, a woman.</i>

You should have married Cline.
- What difference would that have made?

You wouldn't have left her so easily. 
And your children.

- I know what I'm talking about.

No one had more affairs than I did. 
Well,  maybe Casanova, but no one else.

554

Having an affair with another woman is no reason 
for leaving the mother of your children.

There are no standards anymore. 
It's not funny, it's true.

Sylvie brings them, too.

557

- Do I have to smell like a tart?

560

It's an aphrodisiac.

561
00:54:17,867 --> 00:54:25,057
Good. That'll make the girls come running. 
- Sure, but give them a chance chance to smell you. 

562
00:54:25,227 --> 00:54:27,946
Let me look at myself.

them like me anymore.

01:01:27,867 --> 01:01:30,586
<i>I feel sorry for myself, don't you think?</i>

615
01:01:31,507 --> 01:01:33,179
You were genuinely happy. 

616
01:01:34,587 --> 01:01:35,781
<i>You think so?</i>

617
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,426
<i>Perhaps.</i>

618
01:01:45,547 --> 01:01:49,620
<i>I don't want to miss this.
Step aside!</i>

619
01:01:54,827 --> 01:01:59,537
<i>Enjoy. See you.
- Yeah, see you. What are you doing??</i>

620
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:10,501
<i>II want TV-meals.
Or shall I go out for dinner?</i>

621
01:02:11,467 --> 01:02:16,746
<i>I will treat myself to a feast at Le Duc.</i>

622
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:31,139
What a coincidence to find you here. 
- Isn't that amazing?

623
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:33,144
An oyster?

624
01:03:12,947 --> 01:03:16,826
It seems like it was just yesterday 
when I first heard your name. 

625
01:04:36,107 --> 01:04:37,335
Sweet.

626
01:04:41,107 --> 01:04:42,665
No compliments.

627
01:04:46,227 --> 01:04:47,899
And the next chapter?

628
01:04:48,107 --> 01:04:51,497
<i>Sunday. I dread Sunday.</i>

629
01:04:52,507 --> 01:04:57,103
<i>When they turn the TV on,
they have to make sure they're doing it right.</i>

630
01:04:57,307 --> 01:04:59,138
<i>That is very strategic.</i>

631
01:05:00,347 --> 01:05:05,626
<i>It can take hours until the next good samaritan comes by.</i>

632
01:05:06,267 --> 01:05:09,896
<i>Horrible, these Sundays.
No speech therapists, no psychotherapist.</i>

633
01:05:10,107 --> 01:05:14,419
<i>No physiotherapist, no visitors.
A skeleton staff.</i>

634
01:05:14,627 --> 01:05:16,902
<i>Sunday is a long stretch of desert.</i>

635
01:05:17,107 --> 01:05:21,942
<i>But today, Marie nobly suggests she takes me to mass.</i>

636
01:05:22,147 --> 01:05:27,016
<i>I have tried to explain to her that I am not 
a religious man, but without avail.</i>

637
01:05:27,227 --> 01:05:31,857
<i>All over the world people are praying for me.
Top of the list is my daughter, Cleste.</i>

638
01:05:33,147 --> 01:05:34,660
<i>And Marie, of course.</i>

639
01:05:36,467 --> 01:05:39,857
<i>The most diverse deities have been enlisted to help me.</i>

640
01:05:40,267 --> 01:05:43,339
<i>In Nepal, I'm told, they chant a mantra for me.</i>

641
01:05:43,987 --> 01:05:48,617
<i>In Cameroon holy man has procured 
for me the goodwill of Africa's gods.</i>

642
01:05:49,347 --> 01:05:51,338
<i>I have assigned him my right eye.</i>

643
01:05:52,507 --> 01:05:57,103
<i>I can't deny that I have attempted to 
organise this vast spiritual energy...</i>

644
01:05:57,307 --> 01:05:59,184
<i>... to support my existence.</i>

645
01:05:59,387 --> 01:06:04,700
<i>It may not be admirable, it may even be 
a touch hypocritical, but I'll try anything.</i>

646
01:06:13,227 --> 01:06:15,058
I'm very pleased to see you here.

647
01:06:16,107 --> 01:06:20,737
I came to visit you a few days ago. I brought 
the Blessed Sacrament to give you Communion. 

648
01:06:20,947 --> 01:06:22,585
But you were asleep.

649
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:26,456
<i>Yes, he was asleep.
- What?</i>

650
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:29,739
<i>Would you like me to give you Holy Com m union now? 
- No.</i>

651
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:33,459
Yes.
- Would you like me to saya blessing over you? 

652
01:06:33,667 --> 01:06:35,623
<i>No.
- Yes.</i>

653
01:06:36,547 --> 01:06:40,062
Heavenly Father, have mercy on Jean-Dominique, 
who is cruelly afflicted.

654
01:06:41,507 --> 01:06:46,456
Help his body to heal, keep his spirits buoyant,

655
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:49,306
<i>and help him to find faith.
- My spirit is very buoyant, mister.</i>

656
01:06:49,507 --> 01:06:53,022
<i>In the name of the father...
- You made a fool of me.</i>

657
01:07:06,507 --> 01:07:07,576
Fa?

658
01:07:11,707 --> 01:07:12,901
Father?

659
01:07:32,907 --> 01:07:34,226
There are...

660
01:07:34,427 --> 01:07:39,626
<i>Father, there are monks in Bordeaux who 
regularly dedicate their prayers to me.</i>

661
01:07:39,827 --> 01:07:42,421
...who regularly dedicate their prayers to me.

662
01:07:43,227 --> 01:07:47,664
<i>Do they, that's good.
- But the results have been unremarkable.</i>

663
01:07:47,867 --> 01:07:51,542
<i>We must be patient.
- Yes, the doctors saythat, too.</i>

664
01:07:51,747 --> 01:07:54,705
But Jean-Dominque, I want to suggest something to you

665
01:07:54,907 --> 01:07:58,297
In a few weeks time, I shall be 
leading a pilgrimage to Lourdes.

666
01:07:58,507 --> 01:07:59,462
<i>Lourdes?</i>

667
01:07:59,667 --> 01:08:02,625
Dear Beatrice and I thought you 
might want to be part of it.

668
01:08:02,827 --> 01:08:05,102
<i>This is a trap.
- There have been some miraculous cures.</i>

669
01:08:05,307 --> 01:08:08,105
That's true.
<i>- I've been to Lourdes.</i>

670
01:08:33,627 --> 01:08:37,381
Let's stop and return.
- I am not turning back.

671
01:08:37,587 --> 01:08:39,737
Hit's my car, I'll drive where I like.

672
01:08:39,947 --> 01:08:42,939
You said you wanted a dirty weekend.
- I never said that.

673
01:08:43,147 --> 01:08:47,459
Yes you did. Lourdes is not the right place for a dirty week-end.

674
01:08:47,667 --> 01:08:50,022
You've got a one-track mind.

675
01:08:52,267 --> 01:08:54,303
I want to see the Madonna.

676
01:08:56,507 --> 01:09:00,739
I don't believe in any of this.
- I want to see her and drink holy water.

677
01:09:00,947 --> 01:09:02,539
Spare me this.

678
01:09:04,627 --> 01:09:07,539
You should do that too.
It will be good for you.

679
01:09:13,627 --> 01:09:15,424
Imposing, hm?

680
01:09:18,667 --> 01:09:21,261
I'll buy some bottles for the holy water.

681
01:09:43,507 --> 01:09:49,059
That's it for me. I'm leaving.
- Stay. It could do you a lot of good.

682
01:09:49,267 --> 01:09:52,464
Don't be so sure, it might be dangerous. 

683
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:57,502
What if someone in perfect health happened to be here when 
the Madonna appeared? One miracle, and he'd end up paralyzed. 

684
01:09:57,707 --> 01:09:59,186
You are terrible.

685
01:10:00,307 --> 01:10:02,423
Hello.
- Good day, madam.

686
01:10:02,627 --> 01:10:05,300
Look! Here's my Madonna! 

687
01:10:07,747 --> 01:10:12,901
Forget it.
- Yeah, get out of my life.

688
01:10:14,187 --> 01:10:17,179
Okay, I'll give it to you as a present

689
01:10:18,667 --> 01:10:23,297
Madame has a wonderful eye. 
This Madonna been blessed by the Cardinal. 

690
01:10:23,507 --> 01:10:26,544
Do we have more 318's?
- Look in the storage.

691
01:10:26,747 --> 01:10:30,023
How much is that?
-1899 franc.

692
01:10:30,227 --> 01:10:31,455
 

693
01:10:35,387 --> 01:10:39,016
Don't we know each other?
- I don't think so, Mister.

694
01:10:41,627 --> 01:10:43,299
I don't have change.

695
01:10:45,547 --> 01:10:49,984
I can't make love to you with her looking at me. 
- I understand.

696
01:10:50,707 --> 01:10:54,939
I wasn't stating a fact, I was making a complaint. 
Let me turn her off

697
01:10:56,267 --> 01:10:57,416
No.

698
01:10:59,787 --> 01:11:03,700
The only one in the whole world. 
Blessed by the Cardinal. 

699
01:11:06,147 --> 01:11:10,345
Josephine, when we get back to Paris 
we're going to have to split up. 

700
01:11:11,787 --> 01:11:15,541
Because of her? 
- No. Because of everything. 

701
01:11:17,467 --> 01:11:20,459
Ok, you're right.

702
01:11:32,627 --> 01:11:36,336
I'll go out again.
- Turn off the lights.

703
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:40,458
But not my Madonna.

704
01:13:10,707 --> 01:13:12,345
La - la - la - . Come on, Jean-Do. 

705
01:13:16,907 --> 01:13:20,582
If you learn the L sound you'll learn to swallow. 

706
01:13:20,787 --> 01:13:22,982
And you'll learn to say Lourdes.

707
01:13:31,347 --> 01:13:34,225
Is that okay? Is it comfortable?

708
01:13:49,907 --> 01:13:53,695
<i>'The Pressure Cooker' could be the title of the piece...</i>

709
01:13:53,907 --> 01:13:57,183
<i>...I'm writing about my experiences here.</i>

710
01:13:57,387 --> 01:14:00,936
<i>I could also call it 'The Eye' or 'The Diving Bell'.</i>

711
01:14:01,147 --> 01:14:03,661
<i>Plot and location are well known.</i>

712
01:14:03,867 --> 01:14:07,496
<i>In a hospital room, there's Mr. L,
at the climax of his life...</i>

713
01:14:07,707 --> 01:14:13,259
<i>...trying to live with locked-in syndrome 
after a serious stroke.</i>

714
01:14:13,467 --> 01:14:18,018
<i>Ambitious  and somewhat cynical,
because he didn't know failures before...</i>

715
01:14:18,227 --> 01:14:21,663
<i>...becomes acquainted with misfortune.</i>

716
01:14:21,867 --> 01:14:25,143
<i>We his slow transformation
listining to a commentarial voice...</i>

717
01:14:25,347 --> 01:14:27,941
<i>...which tells the inner monologue of Mr. L.</i>

718
01:14:28,147 --> 01:14:31,139
<i>I already have the last scene.
It's ni.</i>

719
01:14:31,347 --> 01:14:34,259
<i>Mr L, who was paralysed since 
the beginning of the piece...</i>

720
01:14:34,467 --> 01:14:39,666
<i>...suddenly jumps out of his bed
and runs over the darkly lit stage.</i>

721
01:14:39,867 --> 01:14:45,419
<i>Then it gets dark again and we hear
Mr L's commentarial voice:</i>

722
01:14:45,627 --> 01:14:47,060
<i>Fuck, it was a dream.</i>

723
01:15:16,027 --> 01:15:18,939
Stand up. I can stand up.

724
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:21,103
Everything is alright.

725
01:16:00,827 --> 01:16:04,058
'I want to remember how all this happened 
to me.'

726
01:16:04,267 --> 01:16:05,985
Shall I ask someone?

727
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:13,056
No?

728
01:16:21,027 --> 01:16:23,985
<i>Hello, room 119.
- Who's that?</i>

729
01:16:26,627 --> 01:16:30,063
I'm Claude Mendibil. 
I'm sitting with Jean-Do.

730
01:16:30,267 --> 01:16:34,738
<i>This is his father speaking.
- Yes, we were expecting your call.</i>

731
01:16:38,707 --> 01:16:41,540
So what do I do? Just talk? 

732
01:16:42,627 --> 01:16:45,858
<i>Jean-Do can hear you.
He will answer you.</i>

733
01:16:46,027 --> 01:16:51,499
<i>You'll hear me saying the alphabet and...
- Yes, Cline told me.</i>

734
01:16:54,747 --> 01:16:57,898
<i>Just talk, Monsieur Bauby.</i>

735
01:16:58,067 --> 01:16:59,705
Can he hear me? 

736
01:17:01,627 --> 01:17:05,063
Jean-Dominique? This is Papinou.

737
01:17:07,987 --> 01:17:11,582
<i>I'm sitting at the open window.</i>

738
01:17:13,987 --> 01:17:17,377
<i>How are you or is that a fool question??</i>

739
01:17:30,027 --> 01:17:32,018
Yes, it's a fool question. 

740
01:17:35,747 --> 01:17:37,339
I miss you. 

741
01:17:51,907 --> 01:17:53,659
<i>I miss you, too.</i>

742
01:17:56,307 --> 01:18:00,061
God Almighty! This is an impossible way to 
conduct a conversation.

743
01:18:00,267 --> 01:18:05,022
Everything goes out of my mind. 
No, no, I've remembered.

744
01:18:06,147 --> 01:18:11,141
<i>I'm sending you a present. 
It's a surprise. </i>

745
01:18:15,627 --> 01:18:17,060
<i>I had a thought....</i>

746
01:18:18,307 --> 01:18:22,346
...about us. We're in the same boat.

747
01:18:22,547 --> 01:18:30,022
I'm stuck in this apartment.
I can't get up and down the stairs.

748
01:18:30,307 --> 01:18:35,301
<i>You try four flights of stairs 
when you're ninety-two years old.</i>

749
01:18:37,267 --> 01:18:40,942
<i>we're both locked-in cases.</i>

750
01:18:41,147 --> 01:18:46,062
<i>You in your body and me in my apartment.</i>

751
01:18:46,267 --> 01:18:48,656
Jean-Dominique, remember,...

752
01:18:48,867 --> 01:18:54,021
...in the top right-hand drawer of my 
writing desk there's a letter..

753
01:18:54,187 --> 01:19:00,023
In it are my last wishes. It's in a file...

754
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:07,616
...marked 'Miscellaneous'.

755
01:19:12,307 --> 01:19:14,298
<i>I must stop now.</i>

756
01:19:28,467 --> 01:19:32,380
Don't cry. 
- That's easy to say.

757
01:19:32,587 --> 01:19:35,465
You're my son for Christ's sake.

758
01:19:36,707 --> 01:19:38,618
Good-bye, Jean-Dominique.

759
01:19:40,147 --> 01:19:43,184
I forgot, it's almost your birthday.

760
01:19:44,787 --> 01:19:46,345
<i>I'll call again.</i>

761
01:19:48,027 --> 01:19:50,018
<i>Happy Birthday.</i>

762
01:20:32,907 --> 01:20:38,584
<i>It can't be easy for a father to speak 
to a son who he knows will never reply.</i>

763
01:20:57,467 --> 01:21:00,584
I thought an outing with a new vista would do you good. 

764
01:21:02,267 --> 01:21:05,942
I have another surprise for you. 
Close your eyes.

765
01:21:07,067 --> 01:21:10,104
Close your eyes.

766
01:21:16,027 --> 01:21:17,858
Okay, now open them. 

767
01:21:18,027 --> 01:21:19,585
THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

768
01:21:19,787 --> 01:21:23,826
<i>That was not necessary.
In two volumes.</i>

769
01:21:24,027 --> 01:21:27,542
It's not a first edition, but it's pretty old. 

770
01:21:31,067 --> 01:21:34,537
Would you like me to read something to you? 
Which chapter?

771
01:21:35,747 --> 01:21:40,298
<i>We should use Roman digits.
We didn't think of Roman digits.</i>

772
01:21:40,507 --> 01:21:42,941
<i>What would it be in Roman digits?</i>

773
01:21:43,147 --> 01:21:46,856
<i>That's L, I, X.</i>

774
01:21:47,907 --> 01:21:51,183
<i>DThat's faster. Next time.</i>

775
01:21:51,667 --> 01:21:55,137
<i>50? Higher?
- Yes, higher.</i>

776
01:21:57,587 --> 01:21:59,418
Nine? 59? Ok.

777
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:03,221
Ok, there we go.

778
01:22:03,427 --> 01:22:07,500
<i>There's even an illustration.
The coincidence frightens me.</i>

779
01:22:08,067 --> 01:22:10,661
'They sat down beside him.'

780
01:22:11,787 --> 01:22:16,781
<i>'Noirtier was sitting in a wheelchair where 
they put him from morning till evening...</i>

781
01:22:16,947 --> 01:22:21,020
<i>...in front of a mirror which allowed 
him to see the whole apartment...</i>

782
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:25,015
<i>without attempting any movement: this was something 
that had become impossible for him.</i>

783
01:22:26,307 --> 01:22:29,105
<i>Sight and hearing were the only two senses...</i>

784
01:22:29,307 --> 01:22:33,425
<i>...which, like two sparks, 
still lit up this human matter.'</i>

785
01:22:34,187 --> 01:22:37,065
'...this human matter.'

786
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:40,940
<i>That's me, don't you think?</i>

787
01:22:41,987 --> 01:22:43,978
<i>But no.
- But yes.</i>

788
01:22:44,187 --> 01:22:47,304
<i>I frighten people, make them shudder.</i>

789
01:22:48,587 --> 01:22:52,899
<i>You don't.
- I should have stayed away from Dumas.</i>

790
01:22:53,107 --> 01:22:56,941
<i>Don't tamper with a masterpiece. 
That's the lesson.</i>

791
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:02,063
<i>I didn't know Noirtier was the man 
I was going to become.</i>

792
01:23:03,707 --> 01:23:07,461
<i>My diving bell has dragged you down 
to the bottom of the sea with me..</i>

793
01:23:07,667 --> 01:23:13,219
Jean-Do, I don't find it so bad that you 
drag me down to the bottom of the sea...

794
01:23:13,427 --> 01:23:16,021
...because you are also my butterfly.

795
01:23:17,507 --> 01:23:19,941
<i>That's a declaration of love.</i>

796
01:23:21,707 --> 01:23:24,301
<i>After we finish this book...</i>

797
01:23:24,427 --> 01:23:28,022
<i>...we'll write another one about 
a long-distance runner.</i>

798
01:23:28,227 --> 01:23:30,457
<i> You never know. Perhaps I'll become like him. .</i>

799
01:23:32,987 --> 01:23:35,581
'I missed you at the bullfight.

800
01:23:35,787 --> 01:23:39,063
I hope we meet again next year.
Jean-Paul.'

801
01:23:39,227 --> 01:23:41,502
Le Tango, Nmes.

802
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:57,306
'Dear Mr Bauby, the customized campmobile...

803
01:23:57,507 --> 01:24:04,504
...can be delivered six to eight 
weeks after your order.

804
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:07,858
Yours sincerely, Henri Raynaud.'
That's good news.

805
01:24:10,947 --> 01:24:12,778
This is from Papinou.

806
01:24:19,867 --> 01:24:21,744
'This is a present.'

807
01:24:24,547 --> 01:24:27,505
Look, a photo of you as a kid.

808
01:24:29,467 --> 01:24:31,981
Jean-Do, aged eight, Berck sur Mer.

809
01:24:36,347 --> 01:24:37,826
From Anne-Marie.

810
01:24:42,027 --> 01:24:45,576
<i>Jean-Dominique Bauby's room.
- Who are you? </i>

811
01:24:45,787 --> 01:24:47,857
Cline Desmoulins. And you?

812
01:24:48,707 --> 01:24:53,223
<i>Ins. I want to speak with Jean-Do.</i>

813
01:24:54,947 --> 01:24:56,175
One moment.

814
01:24:59,507 --> 01:25:02,419
I turned the speaker on, so he can hear you.

815
01:25:02,627 --> 01:25:05,937
<i>I can't speak with you there.</i>

816
01:25:06,147 --> 01:25:10,106
You have to, there's no one else. 

817
01:25:10,267 --> 01:25:12,940
<i>Isn't the therapist there?
- No, she's not here today.</i>

818
01:25:21,747 --> 01:25:22,816
<i>Darling?</i>

819
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:30,741
<i>I know I said I'd come but I got as far as 
the train station and then turned back.</i>

820
01:25:31,827 --> 01:25:33,340
<i>I just can't.</i>

821
01:25:34,427 --> 01:25:36,497
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

822
01:25:40,587 --> 01:25:42,305
<i>Cline?
- Yes.</i>

823
01:25:42,467 --> 01:25:48,144
<i>Can't you just go out for a moment?
I have personal things to say.</i>

824
01:25:48,347 --> 01:25:50,815
<i>I feel embarrassed.
- I can't leave him.</i>

825
01:25:51,027 --> 01:25:54,781
There's nobody else.
Wait, he wants to say something.

826
01:25:57,987 --> 01:25:59,386
O?

827
01:26:03,627 --> 01:26:04,821
One?

828
01:26:13,027 --> 01:26:14,983
One minute?

829
01:26:15,187 --> 01:26:17,860
I'm leaving. But not for long.

830
01:26:24,187 --> 01:26:27,224
<i>Jean-Do, are you alone now? ?</i>

831
01:26:30,827 --> 01:26:32,101
<i>Darling...</i>

832
01:26:33,427 --> 01:26:35,463
<i>I love you more than ever.</i>

833
01:26:37,467 --> 01:26:40,425
<i>I want to see you but I haven't the courage.</i>

834
01:26:42,347 --> 01:26:44,542
<i>I want to think of you as you were.</i>

835
01:26:47,107 --> 01:26:48,540
<i>I hope you'll recover.</i>

836
01:26:50,667 --> 01:26:52,703
<i>I miss you.</i>

837
01:26:53,227 --> 01:26:57,459
<i>I miss you and I feel so alone.</i>

838
01:26:59,027 --> 01:27:01,257
<i>I know you understand.</i>

839
01:27:04,387 --> 01:27:06,696
<i>You're in my thoughts all the time.</i>

840
01:27:13,547 --> 01:27:17,096
<i>I know your family is always with you.</i>

841
01:27:22,067 --> 01:27:23,978
<i>Do you want me to come?</i>

842
01:27:25,267 --> 01:27:27,781
<i>I'm back.
- Do you want me to come?</i>

843
01:27:27,987 --> 01:27:32,265
<i>Do you want me to come?
- I'm back, Ins.</i>

844
01:28:03,787 --> 01:28:05,106
Every...

845
01:28:21,227 --> 01:28:23,183
Every day.

846
01:28:39,707 --> 01:28:41,379
Every day I'm...

847
01:29:02,667 --> 01:29:04,942
Every day I'm waiting for you.

848
01:29:05,227 --> 01:29:07,582
<i>I can't understand you. Could you repeat that?</i>

849
01:29:08,547 --> 01:29:10,105
<i>I can't understand you.</i>

850
01:29:12,467 --> 01:29:15,061
He said: I'm waiting for you every day.

851
01:30:20,427 --> 01:30:25,581
If I don't get a seat on this plane, 
I will miss my connection to Hong- Kong.

852
01:30:28,907 --> 01:30:31,626
Take mine.

853
01:30:32,027 --> 01:30:35,019
I'll take the next flight.
- Thank you.

854
01:30:35,867 --> 01:30:37,220
Have a good trip.

855
01:30:42,107 --> 01:30:45,258
But you're not going to Hong Kong 
you are going to Beirut.

856
01:30:57,747 --> 01:31:00,466
Anything wrong? You don't feel good?

857
01:31:00,907 --> 01:31:03,182
Don't worry.

858
01:31:10,907 --> 01:31:16,345
<i>Most times I forget my dreams.
People who tell you their dreams are tiresome.</i>

859
01:31:17,467 --> 01:31:20,903
<i>But this one comes again and again.
I don't know why.</i>

860
01:31:21,787 --> 01:31:23,505
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

861
01:31:24,547 --> 01:31:28,222
<i>The feeling of doom wouldn't leave.</i>

862
01:31:28,427 --> 01:31:32,466
<i>It took what I can only describe as 
a miracle to lift my spirits.</i>

863
01:31:34,867 --> 01:31:39,622
<i>It's dangerous to believe in personal miracles. 
They tend to make one feel self-important.</i>

864
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:45,106
<i>Nevertheless, I must report that I believe 
something miraculous did occur</i>

865
01:31:45,947 --> 01:31:48,461
<i>I began to sing.</i>

866
01:31:49,947 --> 01:31:52,745
<i>I grunt, I sing.</i>

867
01:31:53,907 --> 01:31:57,786
<i>My hearing isn't great and sometimes 
I think I hear my heart beating.</i>

868
01:31:57,987 --> 01:32:01,297
<i>But I ell myself it's the sound 
of butterfly's wings.</i>

869
01:32:01,467 --> 01:32:06,018
<i>Yes, I am making indomitable progress and 
I may even have butterfly hearing.</i>

870
01:32:06,227 --> 01:32:09,902
<i>I can look forward to the future. 
Soon the summer will come to an end ...</i>

871
01:32:10,107 --> 01:32:12,905
<i>...and I will begin my first 
autumn in this hospital.</i>

872
01:32:15,067 --> 01:32:16,386
<i>My life is here.</i>

873
01:32:17,307 --> 01:32:19,059
<i>An everlasting repetition.</i>

874
01:32:20,547 --> 01:32:21,866
<i>Here.</i>

875
01:32:22,827 --> 01:32:24,704
How goes it?

876
01:32:26,587 --> 01:32:27,542
He's speaking!

877
01:32:28,507 --> 01:32:31,305
You're speaking.
- He can sing a song, too.

878
01:32:31,867 --> 01:32:36,304
Come on, sing for Laurent.
- Please, for me. 

879
01:32:43,627 --> 01:32:47,905
<i>Le kangourou a saut le mur
Le mur du zoo</i>

880
01:32:48,827 --> 01:32:52,581
<i>Mon Dieu qu'il tait haut 
Mon Dieu qu'il tait beau</i>

881
01:32:54,467 --> 01:32:56,298
Are you ok?

882
01:32:56,507 --> 01:32:59,021
Does he sing?
- No, he doesn't.

883
01:33:17,907 --> 01:33:19,306
<i>I have pneumonia.</i>

884
01:33:22,227 --> 01:33:24,377
<i>Just when I thought...</i>

885
01:33:36,947 --> 01:33:43,182
<i>Like a sailor who watches the shore gradually disappear.
II watch my past recede.</i>

886
01:33:44,147 --> 01:33:47,264
<i>Becoming ashes of oblivion.</i>

887
01:34:02,467 --> 01:34:04,185
<i>What a comeback.</i>

888
01:34:04,787 --> 01:34:10,259
<i>That's where I worked.  And that couple, I know them, 
but I can't remember their names.</i>

889
01:34:11,747 --> 01:34:13,578
<i>That's my car!</i>

890
01:34:14,187 --> 01:34:16,143
<i>My new car.</i>

891
01:35:28,667 --> 01:35:30,578
Where is the horn?

892
01:36:13,347 --> 01:36:16,259
Let me hug you.
- See my car?

893
01:36:16,467 --> 01:36:18,219
Lovely.

894
01:36:20,947 --> 01:36:22,699
Everything ok, Tho?

895
01:36:23,147 --> 01:36:24,978
Had a good week?

896
01:36:25,267 --> 01:36:29,943
Are we going to a theatre?
- To a theatre? If you want to.

897
01:36:30,147 --> 01:36:33,856
Can we have oysters? 
- Do you like oysters now?

898
01:36:38,667 --> 01:36:40,703
Don't bring him back too late.

899
01:36:43,227 --> 01:36:45,058
We are leaving.

900
01:36:46,707 --> 01:36:50,825
Can I get in the front?
- Sure, there's no room in the back. 

901
01:36:57,627 --> 01:37:00,380
Binnenkort maken we met z'n tweetjes
een ritje.

902
01:37:01,027 --> 01:37:03,382
A little bit of wind?

903
01:37:16,627 --> 01:37:20,222
Your team ok?
- Yeah, the players are ok.

904
01:37:20,427 --> 01:37:26,536
You take a shower afterwards?
- We shower and wash our stuff.

905
01:37:26,747 --> 01:37:30,422
Got pubic hair around your willy?
- No, not yet.

906
01:37:30,627 --> 01:37:36,099
We had one guy who didn't want to undress for the shower.

907
01:37:36,307 --> 01:37:41,745
The club said he had to.
There was a fight.

908
01:37:42,587 --> 01:37:47,377
He didn't do it.
His mother appeased him.

909
01:37:48,147 --> 01:37:52,265
In the end, he had to leave the team.

910
01:37:55,427 --> 01:37:59,102
You don't have that problem, do you?

911
01:37:59,307 --> 01:38:02,458
*keine Ahnung worber die quatschen*

912
01:38:02,667 --> 01:38:06,546
Other news? Everything ok with mom?
- Yeah, she's ok.

913
01:38:06,747 --> 01:38:10,376
You know this way?
- Yes, it's the way to Aunt Diane.

914
01:38:12,027 --> 01:38:14,097
It's hot. You feel that, too?

915
01:38:15,547 --> 01:38:17,617
No, I don't.

916
01:38:21,347 --> 01:38:22,746
We have...

917
01:38:24,387 --> 01:38:26,105
We have...

918
01:38:36,227 --> 01:38:41,540
It might start to rain. I'll stop for a moment.

919
01:38:58,027 --> 01:39:00,416
Dad, what's the matter? 

920
01:39:50,867 --> 01:39:53,017
Phone your mother!

921
01:39:54,787 --> 01:39:59,383
My last thought was we'll have to cancel 
going to the theatre.

922
01:39:59,547 --> 01:40:04,575
We'd be late in any case.
We'll go tomorrow night.

923
01:40:05,587 --> 01:40:07,782
And then I sank into a coma.

924
01:40:46,187 --> 01:40:48,303
Is it a book? 

925
01:40:58,467 --> 01:41:01,459
For Thophile, Cleste and Hortense.

926
01:41:01,627 --> 01:41:04,824
I wish them lots of butterflys.

927
01:41:07,267 --> 01:41:09,861
And my deepest gratitude to Claude Mendibil.

928
01:41:10,067 --> 01:41:15,300
You'll understand that wihout her 
this book couldn't have been written.

929
01:41:46,067 --> 01:41:47,580
I was here the whole time.

930
01:41:48,107 --> 01:41:49,381
You know that.

931
01:41:52,547 --> 01:41:55,698
These reviews are terrific! 
You want to hear them? 

932
01:41:55,867 --> 01:42:00,065
The man who dictates in silence.
Without gestures or speech.

933
01:42:00,267 --> 01:42:05,057
Jean-Dominque Bauby communicates
with an eyelid and writes this book.

934
01:42:05,267 --> 01:42:10,421
A touching visit at the 
wreckage of abandonment.

935
01:42:10,587 --> 01:42:12,066
By Bernard Chapuis.

936
01:42:12,667 --> 01:42:14,498
'A touching book.'

937
01:42:21,067 --> 01:42:26,300
Jean- Dominique Bauby, 43ans, journaliste rput, 
pre de famille, homme libre...

938
01:42:26,507 --> 01:42:29,738
...projetait d'crire un roman sur la vengeance au fminin

939
01:42:37,067 --> 01:42:40,457
Jean-Dominique Bauby
died on March 9, 1997...

940
01:42:40,667 --> 01:42:44,626
...10 days after the publication of 
'The Diving Bell and the Butterfly'.

English Translation by XL

942
01:43:29,267 --> 01:43:33,300
Couldn't find English subs, so I crated them myself
using an English version of the script
and several online dictionaries

943
01:43:33,508 --> 01:43:38,000
But as a German, I'm no English native speaker
so please excuse any misspellings or other flaws.
Hope you enjoyed as much as I did.
