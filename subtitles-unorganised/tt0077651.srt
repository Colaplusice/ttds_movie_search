1
00:02:07,886 --> 00:02:11,586
{y:i}Black cats and goblins and broomsticks and ghosts.

2
00:02:11,787 --> 00:02:15,186
{y:i}Pumpkins of witches are there to roast.

3
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:18,686
{y:i}You may think, they scare me. You're probably right.

4
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:21,686
{y:i}Black cats and goblins on Halloween night.

5
00:02:21,686 --> 00:02:23,387
{y:i}Trick-or-treat!!!

6
00:02:44,087 --> 00:02:47,586
My parents won't be home untill ten.
- Are you sure?

7
00:02:57,286 --> 00:02:58,787
We're all alone, aren't we?

8
00:02:59,687 --> 00:03:01,586
Michael's around someplace ...

9
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:04,786
Take off that thing.

10
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,187
Let's go upstairs.
- Ok.

11
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:33,286
Look, Judith, it's very late.

12
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:34,587
I gotta go.

13
00:04:34,587 --> 00:04:36,186
Will you call me tomorrow?

14
00:04:36,886 --> 00:04:38,886
Yeah, sure.
- Promise?

15
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:39,886
Yeah.

16
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:48,986
Michael?

17
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:30,287
Michael?

18
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:47,086
Ever done anything like this before?

19
00:07:48,287 --> 00:07:50,186
Only minimum security.

20
00:07:50,586 --> 00:07:51,986
I see.

21
00:07:54,086 --> 00:07:57,486
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on the right.

22
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:02,386
The only thing that ever bothers me is their jibberish.

23
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:06,087
When they start raving on and on ...

24
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,786
You haven't anything to worry about.

25
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:12,586
He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.

26
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:15,287
Are there any special instructions?

27
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:18,686
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here.

28
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:20,786
Don't underestimate it.

29
00:08:20,786 --> 00:08:23,787
Don't you think we could refer to 'it' as him?

30
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:26,286
If you say so.

31
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:29,987
Your compassion's overwhelming, Doctor.

32
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:39,786
What do I give him,
when we're taking him in front of the judge?

33
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,786
Thorazin.

34
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:46,786
Barely be able to sit up.
- That's the idea.

35
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:58,686
You're serious about that, aren't you?

36
00:08:59,187 --> 00:09:00,087
Yeah.

37
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:06,586
You mean, you actually never want him to get out.
- Never ever ...

38
00:09:07,286 --> 00:09:08,186
Never.

39
00:09:09,086 --> 00:09:13,687
Then why we're taking up to Hardy county,
if he just gonna ... - Because that is the law.

40
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:16,486
We are.

41
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:25,386
Since when do they let them wander around?

42
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:30,186
Pull up to the main gate.
- Shouldn't we ... - Pull up?

43
00:09:39,886 --> 00:09:41,086
Stop here.

44
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:47,786
Shouldn't we go on up to the hospital on ...
- Wait!

45
00:10:46,786 --> 00:10:48,086
Are you all right?

46
00:10:48,086 --> 00:10:51,786
You all right?
- Yes, I'm ok. - He's gone. He's gone?

47
00:10:51,786 --> 00:10:53,386
The evil is gone!

48
00:10:58,686 --> 00:10:59,887
I gotta ...

49
00:11:58,686 --> 00:12:01,586
Don't forget to drop the key off the Myers place ...

50
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:03,487
I won't.

51
00:12:03,487 --> 00:12:08,486
They're coming by look at the house at 10:30.
Be sure you leave it under the mat ... - Promise.

52
00:12:41,987 --> 00:12:42,987
Laurie ...

53
00:12:44,786 --> 00:12:46,287
Hi Tommy.

54
00:12:48,786 --> 00:12:51,586
Coming over tonight?
- Same time, same place.

55
00:12:51,586 --> 00:12:53,587
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
- Sure.

56
00:12:53,587 --> 00:12:55,786
And watch the monster movies?
- Sure.

57
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:57,086
Will you read to me?

58
00:12:57,086 --> 00:13:00,186
Can we make popcorn?
- Sure, sure, sure.

59
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:04,286
You better hurry up.

60
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:09,087
How can you walk in the school this way?
- My dad asked me to.

61
00:13:09,087 --> 00:13:10,287
Why?

62
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:11,686
I have to drop off the key.

63
00:13:11,686 --> 00:13:12,786
Why?

64
00:13:12,786 --> 00:13:14,287
Because he's gonna sell a house.

65
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:15,487
Why?

66
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:17,586
Because that's his job.
- Where?

67
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:18,986
The Meyers house.

68
00:13:18,986 --> 00:13:20,687
The Meyers house!

69
00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:31,486
You're not supposed to go up there?

70
00:13:31,486 --> 00:13:32,886
Yes, I am.

71
00:13:34,187 --> 00:13:35,886
That's a spook house.

72
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:37,786
Just watch.

73
00:13:47,386 --> 00:13:49,886
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there.

74
00:13:50,386 --> 00:13:52,787
Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house.

75
00:13:52,787 --> 00:13:57,686
He said real awful stuff happened there once.
- Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.

76
00:13:57,987 --> 00:13:59,087
I gotta go.

77
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:00,287
I see you tonight.

78
00:14:00,686 --> 00:14:02,187
Bye.
- Bye.

79
00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:10,286
* I wish I had you all alone ... *

80
00:14:10,587 --> 00:14:13,787
* Just the two of us ... *

81
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:19,786
* I would hold you close to me ... *

82
00:14:20,586 --> 00:14:23,386
* So close to me ... *

83
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:28,686
* Just the two ... *

84
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:33,086
I'm not responsible, Sam. - Oh, no ...

85
00:14:33,086 --> 00:14:34,286
I told them how dangerous he was!

86
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:37,986
You wouldn't have enough two roadblocks
and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!

87
00:14:37,986 --> 00:14:41,086
But he was your patient, Doctor. If precautions
weren't strong enough, you should have told somebody.

88
00:14:41,086 --> 00:14:42,586
I told everybody!

89
00:14:42,586 --> 00:14:44,186
Nobody listened.
- There's nothing else I can do.

90
00:14:44,186 --> 00:14:46,486
You can get back in there
and get back on the telephone.

91
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,586
Tell them exactly
who walked out of here last night ...

92
00:14:48,586 --> 00:14:51,187
And tell them exactly where he is going.
- Probably going.

93
00:14:51,187 --> 00:14:54,486
I'm wasting my time. - Sam, Haddonfield is
a hundred and fifty miles away from here.

94
00:14:54,486 --> 00:14:58,387
Now, now for God's sake, he can't drive a car!
- He was doing very well last night!

95
00:14:58,387 --> 00:15:00,786
Maybe someone around here gave him lessons.

96
00:15:04,886 --> 00:15:08,286
{Y:i}Doctor Chance, plese come to point C ...

97
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:12,586
{Y:i}Doctor Chance, point C please.

98
00:15:13,187 --> 00:15:15,886
... and the book ends.

99
00:15:15,886 --> 00:15:20,487
But what Samuels is really talking about here ...

100
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,286
is fate.

101
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:24,286
You see ...

102
00:15:24,286 --> 00:15:28,586
fate caught up with several lives here.

103
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:33,586
No matter what course of action Collins took ...

104
00:15:33,586 --> 00:15:37,286
he was destined to his own fate,

105
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:41,287
his own day of reckoning with himself.

106
00:15:41,886 --> 00:15:43,686
The idea ...

107
00:15:43,686 --> 00:15:44,686
is ...

108
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:46,686
that destiny ...

109
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:52,587
is a very real, concrete thing
that every person has to deal with.

110
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:58,586
How does Samuels' view of fate
differ from that of Costaine's? Laurie?

111
00:15:58,586 --> 00:15:59,186
M'am?

112
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:00,987
Answer the question.

113
00:16:02,186 --> 00:16:06,187
Costaine wrote that fate--
was somehow related only to religion

114
00:16:06,287 --> 00:16:11,986
or where Samuels felt that ... well, fate was like
a natural element, like earth, air, fire, and water.

115
00:16:11,986 --> 00:16:15,687
That's right, Samuels definitely personified fate.

116
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:19,687
In Samuels' writing, fate is a moveable like a mountain.

117
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:23,186
It stands, where man passes a way.

118
00:16:23,186 --> 00:16:25,386
Fate never changes.

119
00:16:48,186 --> 00:16:50,286
You, with pumpkin.
- Leave me alone!

120
00:16:50,286 --> 00:16:56,686
He's gonna get you!
- He's gonna get you, he's gonna get you...

121
00:16:56,686 --> 00:16:59,486
The boogeyman is coming!
- Leave me alone!

122
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:02,786
He doesn't believe us.
- Don't you know what happens on Halloween?

123
00:17:02,786 --> 00:17:05,086
Yeah, we get candy.

124
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:12,887
The boogey man!
- The boogey man, the boogey man, the boogey ...

125
00:18:44,286 --> 00:18:45,687
He's on his way.

126
00:18:47,286 --> 00:18:51,086
You gotta believe me officer,
he is coming to Haddonfield.

127
00:18:52,286 --> 00:18:54,586
Because I know him.

128
00:18:55,186 --> 00:18:58,187
I'm his doctor. You must be ready for him.

129
00:18:59,786 --> 00:19:01,486
If you don't, it's your funeral.

130
00:19:53,686 --> 00:19:55,886
We're from Haddonfield, couldn't be prouder.

131
00:19:55,886 --> 00:19:58,286
Can't hear now, we yell a little louder.

132
00:19:58,286 --> 00:20:00,587
We're from Haddonfield, couldn't be prouder!

133
00:20:00,587 --> 00:20:02,086
Can't hear now ... continue
- Oh, look at you.

134
00:20:02,086 --> 00:20:05,586
Get off the books you have.
You neeed a shopping cart to get home.

135
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:11,286
Heeey Haddonfield!
- Yeah, one for me.

136
00:20:12,686 --> 00:20:16,086
You know it's totally insane!
We have three new cheers to learn in the morning,

137
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:19,186
the game in the afternoon, I have to get my hair
done at five and the dance is at eight.

138
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:21,586
I'll be totally wiped out!

139
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:24,086
I don't think get enough to do tommorow.
- Totally!

140
00:20:29,787 --> 00:20:34,786
As usual, I have nothing to do.
- It's your own fault and I don't feel bit sorry for you.

141
00:20:36,186 --> 00:20:38,386
Hey, Lynda, Laurie!

142
00:20:38,886 --> 00:20:40,386
Why didn't you wait for me?

143
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:41,187
We did.

144
00:20:41,187 --> 00:20:45,586
Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed.
- That's not true. Here I am.

145
00:20:48,387 --> 00:20:52,186
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
- I'm never smiling again.

146
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:57,586
Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell ...
- Exploring uncharted territory?- It's been totally charted.

147
00:20:57,586 --> 00:20:58,786
We just talked.

148
00:20:58,786 --> 00:20:59,987
Sure, sure.

149
00:20:59,987 --> 00:21:04,786
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs
and soaping windows. His parents grounded him.

150
00:21:04,786 --> 00:21:06,586
He can't come over tonight.

151
00:21:06,586 --> 00:21:10,586
I thought you were babysitting tonight. - The only reason
she babysits is to have a place to... - Oh shit ...

152
00:21:11,786 --> 00:21:13,786
I have a place for that.

153
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:16,286
I forgot my chemistry book.

154
00:21:16,786 --> 00:21:21,286
So, who cares? I always forget my chemistry book
and my math book and my english book and my ...

155
00:21:21,286 --> 00:21:23,086
and let's see my French book and ...

156
00:21:23,086 --> 00:21:27,586
Who needs books anyway? I don't need books.
I always forget all of my books. I mean ...

157
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,886
it doesn't really matter if I you got that books or not.

158
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:33,287
Hey, isn't that the van Graham?

159
00:21:35,186 --> 00:21:36,487
I don't think so.

160
00:21:37,186 --> 00:21:38,786
I think he's cute.

161
00:21:43,086 --> 00:21:44,586
Hey, jerk ...

162
00:21:45,186 --> 00:21:47,286
Speed kills!

163
00:21:57,386 --> 00:21:59,387
Gosh ... Can't he take a joke?

164
00:22:07,186 --> 00:22:09,886
You know, Annie, some day
you gonna get us all into deep trouble.

165
00:22:12,887 --> 00:22:14,286
Totally.

166
00:22:14,286 --> 00:22:17,786
I hate a guy with a car and no sense of humor.

167
00:22:20,486 --> 00:22:22,486
Well, are we still on for tonight?

168
00:22:22,486 --> 00:22:25,487
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.

169
00:22:25,487 --> 00:22:27,186
Oh come on, Annie ...

170
00:22:27,186 --> 00:22:29,587
Bob and I've been planning on it all week.

171
00:22:29,587 --> 00:22:31,086
All right.

172
00:22:31,486 --> 00:22:33,486
The Wallaces leave at seven.

173
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:34,787
I'm babysitting the Doyles.

174
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:39,786
It's only three houses down. We can keep each other
company. - Ohh, terrific ... I've got three choices.

175
00:22:39,786 --> 00:22:44,087
Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda
screw around or talk to you.

176
00:22:47,586 --> 00:22:49,886
We're so ma ...

177
00:22:49,886 --> 00:22:51,186
Here.

178
00:23:21,286 --> 00:23:22,886
What time at night?

179
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:27,186
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my little
brother trick- or-treating. - Saving the treats for Bob?

180
00:23:27,186 --> 00:23:28,386
Fun-ny.

181
00:23:28,386 --> 00:23:30,586
See you.
- Bye. - Bye.

182
00:23:43,786 --> 00:23:45,086
Annie, look.

183
00:23:45,587 --> 00:23:46,786
Look where?

184
00:23:46,786 --> 00:23:48,186
Behind the bush.

185
00:23:49,787 --> 00:23:53,586
I don't see anything.
- That guy who drove by so fast, when you yelled at.

186
00:23:54,286 --> 00:23:56,186
Subtle, isn't he?

187
00:24:03,287 --> 00:24:05,086
Hey, creep!

188
00:24:07,886 --> 00:24:11,386
Laurie, dear, he wants to talk to you.

189
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:14,687
He wants to take you out tonight.

190
00:24:29,287 --> 00:24:30,786
He was standing right there.

191
00:24:30,786 --> 00:24:32,487
Poor Laurie.

192
00:24:32,487 --> 00:24:34,786
Scared another one away.

193
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:37,986
It's tragic. You never go out.

194
00:24:37,986 --> 00:24:43,086
You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting
so much. - Guys think I'm too smart.

195
00:24:43,086 --> 00:24:47,087
I don't. I think you're whacko.
Now you're seeing men behind bushes.

196
00:24:49,686 --> 00:24:52,086
Well, home sweet home.

197
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:54,186
See you later.

198
00:24:54,686 --> 00:24:56,586
Bye.
- Bye.

199
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:15,586
Excuse me, Laurie. - Oh, Mr. Brackett,
I'm sorry, Mr. Brackett. - Oh, I didn't mean to scary ya.

200
00:25:15,586 --> 00:25:16,786
I'm sorry.

201
00:25:17,287 --> 00:25:20,986
You know, it's Halloween.
I guess everybody's entitled to a one good scare.

202
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:22,387
Yes, sir.

203
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:23,886
Nice evening, sir.

204
00:26:02,486 --> 00:26:05,087
Trick -o - treat, Trick -o - treat.

205
00:26:08,786 --> 00:26:10,387
Oh, kiddo ...

206
00:26:10,387 --> 00:26:12,686
thought you grew up from superstition.

207
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:02,286
Hello?

208
00:27:06,186 --> 00:27:07,086
Hello?

209
00:27:09,986 --> 00:27:11,486
Who is this?

210
00:27:21,586 --> 00:27:22,486
Hello?

211
00:27:22,486 --> 00:27:23,986
{Y:i}Why did you hang up on me?

212
00:27:23,986 --> 00:27:24,786
Annie?

213
00:27:24,786 --> 00:27:26,086
Was that you?

214
00:27:26,086 --> 00:27:29,186
{Y:i}Of course.
- Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.

215
00:27:29,186 --> 00:27:31,186
{Y:i}I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?

216
00:27:31,186 --> 00:27:33,086
I thought it was an obscene phone call.

217
00:27:33,086 --> 00:27:37,887
{Y:i}Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
- I've already lost it.

218
00:27:37,887 --> 00:27:38,786
{Y:i}I Doubt that.

219
00:27:38,786 --> 00:27:42,186
{Y:i}Listen, my mother is letting me use her car.
I'll pick you up. 6:30.

220
00:27:42,186 --> 00:27:44,586
{Y:i}Ok, bye.
-Bye.

221
00:27:56,786 --> 00:27:58,687
Just calm down.

222
00:27:59,986 --> 00:28:01,686
This is ridiculous.

223
00:29:17,787 --> 00:29:18,987
Hurry up.

224
00:29:28,786 --> 00:29:30,186
Just have time.

225
00:29:43,586 --> 00:29:45,887
Judith Myers. Myers.

226
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:49,286
Row 18 ... plot 20.

227
00:29:50,786 --> 00:29:54,086
Hey, you know. You know,
every town has something like this happen.

228
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,686
I remember over in Russellville.

229
00:29:56,686 --> 00:30:00,086
Old Charly Bowles. About fifteen years ago.

230
00:30:00,587 --> 00:30:02,986
One night he, he finished dinner ...

231
00:30:03,286 --> 00:30:06,086
And he excused himself from the table ...

232
00:30:06,586 --> 00:30:08,987
And he went out to the garage ...

233
00:30:09,486 --> 00:30:11,786
He got himself a hack saw ...

234
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,786
And then he went back into the house ...

235
00:30:14,786 --> 00:30:17,686
And he kissed his wife and two children goodbye ...

236
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:20,586
And then he proceeded ...
- Where are we?

237
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:23,786
It's right over here.

238
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:27,587
Myers, Judith Myers. I remember her.

239
00:30:27,587 --> 00:30:28,886
Couldn't believe.

240
00:30:28,886 --> 00:30:30,586
Such a young boy.

241
00:30:31,686 --> 00:30:33,086
Well, you lost?

242
00:30:34,086 --> 00:30:35,786
Why do they do it?

243
00:30:35,786 --> 00:30:37,586
Goddamn kids.

244
00:30:39,486 --> 00:30:41,486
They'll do anything for Halloweens.

245
00:30:42,486 --> 00:30:45,586
It was grave, hers.
- Oh, I know that.

246
00:30:46,286 --> 00:30:47,986
18, 19 ...

247
00:30:50,986 --> 00:30:52,286
Judith Myers.

248
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,186
He came home.

249
00:31:02,087 --> 00:31:03,586
You still spooked?

250
00:31:03,586 --> 00:31:05,187
I wasn't spooked.

251
00:31:06,086 --> 00:31:08,086
Lies.
- I wasn't.

252
00:31:08,086 --> 00:31:11,786
Saw somebody standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
- Probably Mr. Riddle.

253
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:16,486
He was watching me.
- Mr. Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mr. Riddle is 87.

254
00:31:16,486 --> 00:31:17,787
He can still watch.

255
00:31:17,787 --> 00:31:19,687
That's probably all he can do.

256
00:31:20,687 --> 00:31:26,186
What's the pumkin for? - I brought it for Tommy. I figured
carving a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.

257
00:31:26,186 --> 00:31:29,087
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
-

258
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:32,786
Thanks. - And for that matter,
I might as well be a girl scout myself tonight.

259
00:31:32,786 --> 00:31:36,286
I plan on making popcorn
and watching Doctor Demensia.

260
00:31:36,286 --> 00:31:41,186
Six straight hours of horror movies.
Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.

261
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:52,087
My dad!

262
00:31:52,087 --> 00:31:53,386
Get rid of this.

263
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,086
Laurie, stop caughing. What's the matter with you?

264
00:32:06,086 --> 00:32:09,687
Just be natural. There he is. Just be natural, Laurie.

265
00:32:14,186 --> 00:32:15,786
Hi, Annie, Laurie...

266
00:32:16,486 --> 00:32:17,686
Hi, Dad.

267
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:21,187
What happened?
- What? What happened?

268
00:32:21,187 --> 00:32:24,387
Somebody broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.

269
00:32:24,387 --> 00:32:26,586
You blame everything on kids.

270
00:32:26,586 --> 00:32:32,186
What all they took was some Halloween masks, a rope
and a couple of knives. Who do you think it was?

271
00:32:32,186 --> 00:32:34,586
It's hard growing up with a cynical father.

272
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,586
Aren't you gonna be late ...
- Huh?

273
00:32:37,586 --> 00:32:41,586
I said aren't you gonna be late.
- He shouts too.

274
00:32:45,486 --> 00:32:46,586
Bye girls.

275
00:32:46,786 --> 00:32:48,486
Bye dad.
- Bye.

276
00:32:56,786 --> 00:32:57,787
Sheriff.

277
00:32:58,986 --> 00:33:01,887
Pardon me, I'm a Loomis. Dr. Sam Loomis.

278
00:33:01,887 --> 00:33:04,586
Lee Brackett.
- I, I'd like to have a word with you if I could.

279
00:33:04,586 --> 00:33:07,786
Ah, maybe a few minutes. I gotta take that
- It's just important.

280
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:10,287
Ten minutes.
- I'll be here.

281
00:33:26,186 --> 00:33:28,186
What's the matter with you?

282
00:33:28,186 --> 00:33:30,186
I think he knew. I'm sure he could smell it.

283
00:33:30,186 --> 00:33:32,486
No, he didn't.
- He did.

284
00:33:32,486 --> 00:33:34,087
See the look on his face?

285
00:33:34,486 --> 00:33:36,986
He always looks like that.

286
00:33:39,786 --> 00:33:41,686
What  you gonna wear on dance tommorow night?

287
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,286
I didn't know you thought about things like that, Laurie.

288
00:33:51,286 --> 00:33:53,786
You know you could ask somebody.
- No, I couldn't.

289
00:33:53,786 --> 00:33:57,386
Sure you could.
All you have to do is go up to somebody and say ...

290
00:33:57,386 --> 00:33:59,286
You wanna go to the dance?

291
00:33:59,586 --> 00:34:01,586
You could do that, I couldn't.

292
00:34:02,586 --> 00:34:05,786
Or you could ask Dick Paxter.
He could go out with ya.

293
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,286
I try to get out Ben Tramor.

294
00:34:09,487 --> 00:34:11,687
Ben Tramor?

295
00:34:12,286 --> 00:34:14,086
I knew it!

296
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,586
See, you do think about things like that, huh, Laurie?

297
00:34:19,186 --> 00:34:21,586
Shut up.
- He is cute.

298
00:34:21,586 --> 00:34:23,586
Ben Tramor.

299
00:34:56,586 --> 00:34:57,487
Ok.

300
00:34:57,686 --> 00:34:59,086
Bye.

301
00:35:31,086 --> 00:35:41,786
Trick or treat, trick or treat:
give me something good to eat.

302
00:35:52,787 --> 00:35:56,787
Hi. - Hi Annie, come on in.
- How are you doing today? - Fine. How are you?

303
00:35:57,186 --> 00:36:00,887
What time are you in your bed?
- I'm being in bed by nine, ok.

304
00:36:00,887 --> 00:36:02,186
Have a good night, dear.
- Be a good girl.

305
00:36:02,186 --> 00:36:04,087
Bye bye.
- Here.

306
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:33,786
Anybody lives here?
- No, not since 1963 when that happened.

307
00:36:33,786 --> 00:36:37,786
Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
- They may be right.

308
00:36:55,986 --> 00:36:57,586
Look.
- What?

309
00:36:57,786 --> 00:36:59,287
What is that?

310
00:36:59,586 --> 00:37:00,487
It's a dog.

311
00:37:07,687 --> 00:37:08,986
Still warm.

312
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,686
He got hungry.

313
00:37:14,386 --> 00:37:15,786
Could have been a skunk.

314
00:37:15,786 --> 00:37:16,886
Could have.

315
00:37:18,286 --> 00:37:19,786
A man wouldn't do that ...

316
00:37:20,686 --> 00:37:22,187
This is not a man.

317
00:37:58,586 --> 00:38:00,086
It happened in here.

318
00:38:00,687 --> 00:38:03,086
She was sitting right here ...

319
00:38:11,086 --> 00:38:12,786
He could have seen her thru this window.

320
00:38:14,986 --> 00:38:16,586
Standing on the lawn ...

321
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,086
He could have seen in side.

322
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:29,086
You must think of me ...

323
00:38:29,086 --> 00:38:30,686
the very sinister doctor.

324
00:38:33,586 --> 00:38:35,087
I do have a permit.

325
00:38:37,187 --> 00:38:39,686
Seems to me you're just plain scared.

326
00:38:39,686 --> 00:38:40,586
Yes.

327
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:42,086
Yeah, I'm a...

328
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:47,886
I met him ... fifteen years ago.
I was told there was nothing left.

329
00:38:47,886 --> 00:38:55,486
No reason ... nowhere conscience, no understanding
in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death of ...

330
00:38:56,286 --> 00:38:58,986
good or evil, right or wrong.

331
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:00,986
I met this ...

332
00:39:01,486 --> 00:39:04,287
six year-old child with his ...

333
00:39:04,287 --> 00:39:08,286
blank, pale, emotionless face, and ...

334
00:39:09,587 --> 00:39:11,486
the blackest eyes ...

335
00:39:12,086 --> 00:39:13,986
the Devil's eyes.

336
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:17,386
I spent eight years trying to reach him ...

337
00:39:17,386 --> 00:39:20,887
and then another seven trying to keep him locked up,
because I realized that

338
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:24,786
what was living behind that boy's eyes
was purely and simply...

339
00:39:25,087 --> 00:39:26,586
... evil.

340
00:39:27,086 --> 00:39:28,086
What do we do?

341
00:39:29,086 --> 00:39:31,186
He's been here once tonight ...

342
00:39:31,387 --> 00:39:33,086
I think he'll come back.

343
00:39:33,387 --> 00:39:35,186
I'm gonna wait for him.

344
00:39:35,186 --> 00:39:38,286
I still think I should notify the radio and television.
- No.

345
00:39:38,286 --> 00:39:43,987
If you do that, they'll see him on every street corner, they
look for him on every house. Just tell your men to keep their ...

346
00:39:43,987 --> 00:39:46,087
mouth shut and their eyes open.

347
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,586
I'll check back in an hour.

348
00:40:01,886 --> 00:40:03,386
... oh now, cried Arthur.

349
00:40:03,386 --> 00:40:06,186
'Let no one pass this way without a fight!'

350
00:40:06,186 --> 00:40:07,787
'That's so,' said the knight

351
00:40:07,787 --> 00:40:10,086
in a bold and haughty manner.

352
00:40:10,086 --> 00:40:13,886
I don't like that story.
- I thought king Arthur was your favorite.

353
00:40:13,886 --> 00:40:15,386
Not anymore.

354
00:40:17,786 --> 00:40:19,287
Why do you keep them under there?

355
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:21,286
Mom doesn't like me to have them.

356
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,587
'Laser Man' ...

357
00:40:24,186 --> 00:40:27,086
'Neutron Man' ... I can understand why.

358
00:40:27,486 --> 00:40:29,086
'Tarantula Man' ...

359
00:40:29,486 --> 00:40:30,486
Laurie ...

360
00:40:30,486 --> 00:40:32,186
what's the Boogeyman?

361
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,087
Doyle residence.

362
00:40:40,686 --> 00:40:42,786
{Y:i}It's me ...
- Hi Annie, what are you doing?

363
00:40:42,786 --> 00:40:44,586
{Y:i}Making popcorn ...

364
00:40:44,886 --> 00:40:46,387
Having fun ...

365
00:40:46,387 --> 00:40:49,186
Never mind, I'm sure you are.

366
00:40:49,186 --> 00:40:52,687
I have big, big news for you ...

367
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:56,887
Hold on a minute.

368
00:40:58,486 --> 00:40:59,686
Hi Lester...

369
00:41:00,486 --> 00:41:03,187
I'm about to be ripped apart by the family dog.

370
00:41:08,786 --> 00:41:13,086
Lindsey ... get this dog out of the kitchen right now.

371
00:41:23,286 --> 00:41:27,186
I hate that dog ...
I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.

372
00:41:27,686 --> 00:41:29,886
So, what is this big, big news?

373
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:35,086
What would you say if I told you that you were going
to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?

374
00:41:35,886 --> 00:41:37,686
I would probably say you've got the wrong number.

375
00:41:38,387 --> 00:41:39,986
Well ...

376
00:41:40,487 --> 00:41:46,986
I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited
when I told him how attracted you were to him.

377
00:41:46,986 --> 00:41:48,186
Oh, Annie ...

378
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:51,087
Oh, you didn't. Please tell me you didn't.

379
00:41:51,486 --> 00:41:53,187
How could you do that?

380
00:41:53,187 --> 00:41:57,486
I mean how you just call him.
What do you mean it's easy?

381
00:41:58,187 --> 00:41:59,986
I can't believe this.

382
00:42:00,287 --> 00:42:01,886
I can't tell you anything.

383
00:42:09,086 --> 00:42:10,386
Please tell me you didn't.

384
00:42:10,687 --> 00:42:12,286
Oh, you didn't.

385
00:42:13,186 --> 00:42:16,686
Laurie ... - I'm so embarrassed, I couldn't even face him.
- Boogeyman is outside.

386
00:42:17,186 --> 00:42:19,586
Laurie ... out there.
- Hold on.

387
00:42:19,586 --> 00:42:21,686
Laurie, the boogeyman is outside. Look!

388
00:42:27,786 --> 00:42:29,286
Tommy, there is nobody outside.

389
00:42:30,186 --> 00:42:31,587
Go watch TV.

390
00:42:31,986 --> 00:42:33,286
It's just Tommy.

391
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:36,286
Oh, please, Annie ...

392
00:42:36,986 --> 00:42:38,486
You could do that.

393
00:42:39,186 --> 00:42:44,087
Look it's simple. You like him, he likes you.
All you need is a little push.

394
00:42:45,287 --> 00:42:48,287
It won't hurt you to go out with him, for God's sake.

395
00:42:48,786 --> 00:42:49,786
Shit!

396
00:42:50,586 --> 00:42:53,886
No, no, I just made a mess on myself.
I gotta call you back.

397
00:42:53,886 --> 00:42:55,186
Oh, yuck!

398
00:42:55,186 --> 00:42:56,687
Lindsey ...

399
00:42:56,687 --> 00:42:58,787
I need a robe.

400
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:43,286
Lindsey ...

401
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:47,186
Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.

402
00:43:50,687 --> 00:43:52,486
Never mind ...

403
00:43:52,787 --> 00:43:54,586
I guess he found a hot date.

404
00:44:42,787 --> 00:44:45,586
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
- After the movie.

405
00:44:46,286 --> 00:44:49,586
What about the rest of my comic books?
- After the Jack-O-Lantern.

406
00:44:49,786 --> 00:44:51,586
What about the boogeyman?

407
00:44:51,886 --> 00:44:53,387
There is no such thing.

408
00:44:53,387 --> 00:44:55,686
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.

409
00:44:55,686 --> 00:44:57,586
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?

410
00:44:57,586 --> 00:44:58,387
No.

411
00:44:59,587 --> 00:45:03,286
Tommy, Halloween night ...
it's when people play tricks on each other.

412
00:45:03,286 --> 00:45:06,286
It's all make believe.
I think Richie was just trying to scare you.

413
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:10,286
I saw the boogeyman. I saw him outside.

414
00:45:10,286 --> 00:45:12,087
There was nobody outside.

415
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:14,187
There was.
- What did he look like?

416
00:45:15,287 --> 00:45:16,786
The boogyeman!

417
00:45:17,986 --> 00:45:19,586
We're not getting anywhere.

418
00:45:20,287 --> 00:45:21,186
All right.

419
00:45:21,186 --> 00:45:23,487
The boogyeman can only come out
on Halloween night, right?

420
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:24,487
Right.

421
00:45:24,487 --> 00:45:27,787
Welll, I'm here tonight.
I'm not about to let anything happen to you.

422
00:45:28,586 --> 00:45:29,886
Promise?

423
00:45:29,886 --> 00:45:31,386
Promise.

424
00:45:31,386 --> 00:45:33,686
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?

425
00:45:35,086 --> 00:45:36,087
Let's go.

426
00:45:58,686 --> 00:46:00,286
Hmm, terrific.

427
00:46:17,787 --> 00:46:18,687
Hello?

428
00:46:20,687 --> 00:46:22,086
Who's there?

429
00:46:23,887 --> 00:46:27,186
Paul, is this one of your cheap pranks?

430
00:46:30,886 --> 00:46:32,086
Guess not.

431
00:46:33,586 --> 00:46:35,786
No tricks for Annie tonight.

432
00:46:53,586 --> 00:46:55,187
Lindsey!

433
00:46:56,086 --> 00:46:58,086
Lindsey, come out here!

434
00:46:58,086 --> 00:47:02,086
Lindsey, I'm in the laundry room! The door wouldn't open!

435
00:47:02,086 --> 00:47:02,786
{Y:i}Spread out everybody.

436
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:05,186
{Y:i}We gonna try to figure out the shape of this thing.

437
00:47:06,587 --> 00:47:07,886
{Y:i}Holly cat.

438
00:47:07,886 --> 00:47:09,687
{Y:i}Hey.
- Yeah.

439
00:47:10,386 --> 00:47:13,987
{Y:i}Almost perfect.
What's wrong?

440
00:47:14,486 --> 00:47:17,486
{Y:i}We finally got one.
- We found a plain sourcer.

441
00:47:17,987 --> 00:47:20,686
Oh, Lindsey, get the phone, it's Paul.

442
00:47:21,486 --> 00:47:23,287
Lindsey!

443
00:47:24,086 --> 00:47:26,686
Lindseeey!

444
00:47:44,586 --> 00:47:47,386
{Y:i}No, no answer. - Doctor, where are those fingers from?

445
00:47:47,386 --> 00:47:49,186
{Y:i}I don't know, Mr. Scott.
Hallo?

446
00:47:49,186 --> 00:47:52,086
{Y:i}Hi Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?

447
00:47:52,086 --> 00:47:53,387
Yes, she is.

448
00:47:53,387 --> 00:47:54,786
{Y:i}Get her for me, will ya?

449
00:47:54,786 --> 00:47:56,786
She's washing her clothes.

450
00:47:56,786 --> 00:47:59,086
{Y:i}Look, just tell her it's me, ok?

451
00:47:59,286 --> 00:48:00,687
Ok.

452
00:48:05,686 --> 00:48:07,987
Annie, Paul called!

453
00:48:20,386 --> 00:48:23,586
You locked yourself there.
- I know.

454
00:48:25,586 --> 00:48:28,186
Pull my foot. I'm stuck!

455
00:48:46,786 --> 00:48:50,086
Now promise me you won't tell anybody about this.

456
00:49:08,786 --> 00:49:11,286
She got stuck in a window. She'll be right here.

457
00:49:14,286 --> 00:49:16,286
{Y:i}Hello?
Hi Annie.

458
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,486
{Y:i}Oh, hi Paul.
Stuck, huh?

459
00:49:18,486 --> 00:49:23,087
{Y:i}All right, cut it out. It can happen to anyone.
Sure ... stuck in the widow.

460
00:49:23,087 --> 00:49:26,686
Yeah, but I've seen you stuck in plenty of other positions!

461
00:49:26,686 --> 00:49:28,086
My parents are gone.

462
00:49:28,086 --> 00:49:31,186
Oh that's fabulous. When did they leave?

463
00:49:31,186 --> 00:49:34,587
About half ago
- Oh, utterly fantastic.

464
00:49:35,587 --> 00:49:37,787
So why don't you just walk over?

465
00:49:37,787 --> 00:49:41,386
{Y:i}You coming pick me up.
- Well, I can't come now. My clothes are in the wash.

466
00:49:41,386 --> 00:49:47,186
Oh shut up jerk. Can't, I've got a shirt on.
That's all you ever think about.

467
00:49:47,186 --> 00:49:50,886
{Y:i}I think that's all you ever think about.
- That's not true, I think about lots of things.

468
00:49:50,886 --> 00:49:54,886
Now why don't we not stand here
talking about them and get down to doing them?

469
00:49:56,086 --> 00:50:02,986
{Y:i}Lock your doors, bolt your window and turn off the lights.

470
00:50:02,986 --> 00:50:06,787
{Y:i}Don't go away ... cause here is a scene ...
- I'm scared.

471
00:50:07,186 --> 00:50:09,286
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?

472
00:50:09,286 --> 00:50:12,486
I don't know.
- Well, come on get your coat.

473
00:50:12,486 --> 00:50:14,786
I don't want to.

474
00:50:14,786 --> 00:50:20,186
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
- I want to stay here and watch this.

475
00:50:20,186 --> 00:50:24,886
Okay, if I can fix it so you can watch TV
with Tommy Doyle, would you like that?

476
00:50:24,886 --> 00:50:27,787
Yes.
- Well, come with me.

477
00:50:33,186 --> 00:50:34,786
Come on! Hurry up.

478
00:51:00,686 --> 00:51:03,886
{Y:i}That strange that has to short it out.

479
00:51:04,386 --> 00:51:05,686
Hi Tommy.

480
00:51:05,686 --> 00:51:06,386
Hi.

481
00:51:06,386 --> 00:51:10,686
Come on in. We're making a Jack-O-Lantern.
- You know I wanna watch TV.

482
00:51:12,286 --> 00:51:13,886
Annie, come in here.

483
00:51:14,286 --> 00:51:18,186
{Y:i}...now the horrifying conclusion ...

484
00:51:18,186 --> 00:51:20,386
{Y:i}... to ... the them.

485
00:51:22,586 --> 00:51:24,086
Oh, fancy.

486
00:51:24,086 --> 00:51:26,486
This has not been my night.

487
00:51:28,087 --> 00:51:34,786
I spilled butter all over. My cloths are in the wash.
I got stuck in a window. - I'd like you call Ben Tramer

488
00:51:34,786 --> 00:51:39,786
I can't. - Yes, you can. - No, he went drinking with
Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late.

489
00:51:39,786 --> 00:51:42,587
YOU'LL have to call him ... tomorrow.

490
00:51:42,587 --> 00:51:44,886
Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.

491
00:51:45,887 --> 00:51:46,887
Wait a minute.

492
00:51:46,887 --> 00:51:51,886
If you watch her,
I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.

493
00:51:52,286 --> 00:51:53,286
Deal.

494
00:51:54,786 --> 00:51:58,287
I thought Paul was grounded.
- He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out.

495
00:51:58,287 --> 00:52:02,186
Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so, ok?
- Yeah.

496
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:03,786
Bye.

497
00:52:07,587 --> 00:52:10,186
The old girl scout comes through again.

498
00:52:23,086 --> 00:52:27,086
* My Paul ... I give you all *

499
00:52:29,386 --> 00:52:35,787
* No keys, but pleeease ... *
*my Paul *

500
00:53:05,586 --> 00:53:11,086
* Oh, Paul ... *
*I can no longer stall... *

501
00:53:11,086 --> 00:53:19,186
* Oh Paul. Oh Paul ...*
*I can no longer stall... *

502
00:53:19,186 --> 00:53:22,386
* Dearly Paul ... *

503
00:53:23,586 --> 00:53:25,586
* my Paul *

504
00:54:21,686 --> 00:54:22,286
{Y:i}Attention ...

505
00:54:22,286 --> 00:54:24,786
{Y:i}Captain and crew standby reverse polarity.

506
00:54:24,786 --> 00:54:28,586
{Y:i}Standard class A security will be maintained upon landing.

507
00:54:28,786 --> 00:54:31,786
{Y:i}And until further notice all land in and hold on.

508
00:54:31,786 --> 00:54:32,886
{Y:i}That is all.

509
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,386
{Y:i}Artificial gravity are ...

510
00:54:34,386 --> 00:54:36,286
{Y:i}ad lock cut primary coarse.

511
00:54:36,286 --> 00:54:37,787
{Y:i}Primary stature.

512
00:55:01,986 --> 00:55:04,186
Lindsey ...

513
00:55:04,186 --> 00:55:05,787
Lindseyyy ....

514
00:55:06,286 --> 00:55:07,787
Where are you?

515
00:55:33,186 --> 00:55:39,586
There is the boogeyman! He is outside!
Look, there is the boogeyman outside! - What's wrong?

516
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:43,486
I saw the boogeyman! I know that - Oh, Tommy stop it!
- But at Lindsey's! - You're scaring Lindsey.

517
00:55:43,486 --> 00:55:47,186
He's over there!
- Tommy, stop it! There is nobody out there!

518
00:55:47,586 --> 00:55:52,186
There's no boogeyman. And if you don't stop all this
I'll have to turn off the TV and send you to bed.

519
00:55:56,086 --> 00:56:00,686
Nobody believes me.
- I believe you, Tommy.

520
00:56:32,686 --> 00:56:33,686
I'm not afraid.

521
00:56:33,686 --> 00:56:34,986
Bull.

522
00:56:34,986 --> 00:56:36,786
I'm not.
- Then go in.

523
00:56:44,586 --> 00:56:45,687
Chicken.

524
00:56:45,687 --> 00:56:47,186
Go ahead, Lonnie.

525
00:56:48,286 --> 00:56:49,686
Go in!

526
00:56:52,886 --> 00:56:53,686
Hey!

527
00:56:54,386 --> 00:56:55,886
Hey, Lonnie ...

528
00:56:55,886 --> 00:56:58,486
Get your ass away from there ...

529
00:57:10,787 --> 00:57:12,086
Jesus.

530
00:57:12,086 --> 00:57:13,586
Are you all right here?

531
00:57:13,786 --> 00:57:15,086
Yeah.

532
00:57:15,086 --> 00:57:20,786
Well, nothing's going on except kids playing pranks,
trick or treating, partying, getting high.

533
00:57:20,786 --> 00:57:23,086
I have the feeling you're way off on this.

534
00:57:23,086 --> 00:57:26,286
You have the wrong feeling.
- You're not doing very much to prove me wrong.

535
00:57:26,286 --> 00:57:28,086
What more do you need?

536
00:57:28,086 --> 00:57:32,086
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk
to keep me up all night crawling around these bushes.

537
00:57:32,086 --> 00:57:34,586
I, I, I watched him for fifteen years ...

538
00:57:34,586 --> 00:57:38,586
sitting in a room, staring at a wall, not seeing the wall ...

539
00:57:38,586 --> 00:57:40,086
looking past the wall

540
00:57:40,086 --> 00:57:43,486
looking at ... THIS NIGHT inhumanly patient.

541
00:57:45,287 --> 00:57:48,486
waiting for some secret, silent alarm ...

542
00:57:48,486 --> 00:57:50,086
to trigger him off.

543
00:57:50,786 --> 00:57:54,487
Death has come to your little town, sheriff.

544
00:57:54,487 --> 00:57:57,687
You can either ignore it or you can help me to stop it.

545
00:57:58,186 --> 00:57:59,787
More fancy talk.

546
00:58:00,186 --> 00:58:02,086
Doctor, do you know what Haddonfield is?

547
00:58:02,086 --> 00:58:03,186
Families ...

548
00:58:03,186 --> 00:58:06,386
Children ... all lined up in rows,
up and down these streets.

549
00:58:06,386 --> 00:58:08,786
You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.

550
00:58:08,786 --> 00:58:10,386
They could be.

551
00:58:11,686 --> 00:58:13,786
All right, I'll stay with you out tonight ...

552
00:58:13,786 --> 00:58:15,086
just on the chance that you're right.

553
00:58:16,186 --> 00:58:17,686
And if you are right ...

554
00:58:18,186 --> 00:58:20,587
damn you for letting him go.

555
00:58:42,286 --> 00:58:45,286
So we gonna first, we'll go inside, right?
Then we just talk a little.

556
00:58:45,286 --> 00:58:50,286
Then Annie will distract Lindsey, that's when we'll
go upstairs to the first bedroom on the left. You got it?

557
00:58:50,286 --> 00:58:52,586
First I rip your clothes off ...

558
00:58:52,586 --> 00:58:56,286
Don't rip, my blouse is expensive, idiot.
- Then you rip my clothes off...

559
00:58:56,286 --> 00:58:59,187
then we rip Lyndsey's cloth off. Yeah, I think I got it.

560
00:58:59,187 --> 00:59:00,187
Totally.

561
00:59:20,086 --> 00:59:22,786
Bob ... put me down.

562
00:59:22,786 --> 00:59:25,686
Put me down. This is totally silly.

563
00:59:25,686 --> 00:59:26,886
Put me down.

564
00:59:30,086 --> 00:59:32,286
Hey, it's totally dark.
- Yeah.

565
00:59:33,186 --> 00:59:34,386
Annie!

566
00:59:34,786 --> 00:59:37,687
Annie, we're here!
- I wonder where they went.

567
00:59:38,586 --> 00:59:41,286
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something.

568
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:51,187
Hey, let's look for a note.

569
00:59:51,486 --> 00:59:52,686
Let's not.

570
01:00:27,186 --> 01:00:28,787
He's gonna get you ...

571
01:00:28,787 --> 01:00:32,787
No, he's not. - Hey, nobody's getting anybody.
Stop scaring each other.

572
01:00:48,886 --> 01:00:51,386
Everybody's having good time tonight.

573
01:00:52,086 --> 01:00:53,886
All right, guys, what's next?

574
01:00:53,886 --> 01:00:57,887
Let's make more popcorn. - No, we had enough.
Why don't we watch the rest of the movie?

575
01:00:58,086 --> 01:00:59,086
Yeah.

576
01:01:02,886 --> 01:01:04,286
{Y:i}All right, put it back on.

577
01:01:16,587 --> 01:01:17,986
Doyle house.

578
01:01:17,986 --> 01:01:20,086
Hi Laurie ... what's up?

579
01:01:20,086 --> 01:01:22,286
{Y:i}I'm just setting down for the first time tonight.

580
01:01:23,186 --> 01:01:24,786
Hey ... is Annie around?

581
01:01:25,186 --> 01:01:26,486
{Y:i}No, I thought she'd be home by now.

582
01:01:26,486 --> 01:01:29,886
{Y:i}She went to pick up Paul.
- Well, she's totally not here.

583
01:01:31,686 --> 01:01:33,586
She's probably stopped off some place.

584
01:01:33,586 --> 01:01:37,586
Have her call me when she gets home.
I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know

585
01:01:37,786 --> 01:01:41,186
{Y:i}Okay. Later.
- Have a good time.

586
01:01:41,186 --> 01:01:43,286
We definetely will.

587
01:01:44,186 --> 01:01:45,386
Bye.

588
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:52,286
Lindsey is gone for the night.
- Hey, now that's wonderful.

589
01:02:35,486 --> 01:02:37,586
Oh, shit! Not again.

590
01:02:37,586 --> 01:02:39,586
I can't help it. The phone keeps ringing.

591
01:02:40,186 --> 01:02:43,087
Oh, I can't keep you interested, huh?
- Just answer that damn phone.

592
01:02:43,586 --> 01:02:46,086
I can't. What if it's the Wallaces?

593
01:02:46,086 --> 01:02:47,786
We'd get Annie in trouble now.

594
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:53,786
Just take it off the hook.

595
01:03:28,486 --> 01:03:30,486
Fantastic.

596
01:03:32,886 --> 01:03:35,686
Totally.
- Yeah.

597
01:03:47,086 --> 01:03:48,787
Is that all you can say?

598
01:03:48,787 --> 01:03:49,586
Yeah.

599
01:03:52,586 --> 01:03:55,586
Go get me a beer.
- I thought you were gonna get me one.

600
01:03:55,586 --> 01:03:56,686
Yeaah.

601
01:03:59,187 --> 01:04:00,786
I'll be right back.

602
01:04:00,786 --> 01:04:02,986
Don't get dressed.

603
01:04:58,786 --> 01:04:59,786
Annie?

604
01:05:01,086 --> 01:05:02,086
Paul?

605
01:05:05,887 --> 01:05:08,186
Lynda, you asshole!

606
01:05:12,386 --> 01:05:13,786
Ok, Lynda.

607
01:05:13,786 --> 01:05:14,886
Come on out.

608
01:06:18,086 --> 01:06:19,386
Well, did you get my beer?

609
01:06:26,586 --> 01:06:28,786
Cute, Bob. Real cute.

610
01:06:41,186 --> 01:06:42,687
See anything you like?

611
01:06:50,686 --> 01:06:53,087
What's the matter? Can I get your ghost, Bob?

612
01:07:01,586 --> 01:07:03,587
All right, all right. Come on, where is my beer?

613
01:07:09,886 --> 01:07:11,586
Ok, ain't answer me?

614
01:07:15,786 --> 01:07:17,286
Ok, don't answer me?

615
01:07:18,686 --> 01:07:21,986
Oh, you're weird!
- I'm gonna call Laurie.

616
01:07:21,986 --> 01:07:24,586
Well, I'm gonna call Laurie.
I wanna know where Annie and Paul are.

617
01:07:24,586 --> 01:07:26,086
This is going nowhere.

618
01:07:30,286 --> 01:07:31,687
Finally.

619
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:38,686
Hello.

620
01:07:41,987 --> 01:07:42,886
Hello?

621
01:07:45,786 --> 01:07:50,186
All right, Annie. First I get your famous chewing,
now I get your famous squealing?

622
01:07:54,386 --> 01:07:55,886
Annie, you all right?

623
01:08:05,987 --> 01:08:07,786
Are you fooling around again?

624
01:08:09,286 --> 01:08:11,086
I'll kill you if this is a joke.

625
01:08:11,986 --> 01:08:12,986
{Y:i}Annie?

626
01:08:15,986 --> 01:08:16,986
{Y:i}Annie?

627
01:09:06,286 --> 01:09:08,086
Sleep tight, kids.

628
01:12:19,087 --> 01:12:20,287
Paul?

629
01:12:21,287 --> 01:12:22,586
Lynda?

630
01:12:30,687 --> 01:12:31,786
Lynda?

631
01:12:43,286 --> 01:12:44,386
Annie?

632
01:13:02,486 --> 01:13:03,286
Annie?

633
01:13:06,686 --> 01:13:07,786
Lynda?

634
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:11,486
Bob?

635
01:13:27,186 --> 01:13:28,586
All right, Annie ...

636
01:13:53,786 --> 01:13:55,987
All right, meatheads. The joke's over.

637
01:14:00,586 --> 01:14:01,586
Come on, Annie.

638
01:14:01,586 --> 01:14:02,686
It's enough.

639
01:14:06,686 --> 01:14:09,587
This is most definitely stopping funny.
Now cut it out!

640
01:14:12,886 --> 01:14:14,286
You'll be sorry.

641
01:17:26,186 --> 01:17:27,186
No.

642
01:17:53,286 --> 01:17:54,587
Help!

643
01:17:54,986 --> 01:17:57,486
Somebody help me, please!

644
01:17:57,486 --> 01:17:59,586
Somebody help!

645
01:17:59,586 --> 01:18:01,686
Oh, God, help me!

646
01:18:02,286 --> 01:18:03,486

Oh, God, help me, please!

650
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:13,287

01:18:13,786 --> 01:18:14,886
Helloo!

652
01:18:15,186 --> 01:18:16,186

01:18:17,286 --> 01:18:18,886
Helloo, help me!

654
01:18:18,886 --> 01:18:20,786
Will you please help me?

655
01:18:20,786 --> 01:18:22,086
Please!

656
01:18:22,787 --> 01:18:24,386
Can't you hear me?!

657
01:18:24,886 --> 01:18:26,086
Oh,God ...

658
01:18:29,186 --> 01:18:31,486
Help me, please!

659
01:18:43,086 --> 01:18:44,487
The keys!

660
01:18:44,487 --> 01:18:46,486
Oh, the keys!

661
01:18:51,386 --> 01:18:52,686

Who is it?

665
01:19:12,186 --> 01:19:14,186
Tommy please!

666

Tommy, hurry up!

667
01:19:16,586 --> 01:19:18,686
Tommy please!

668
01:19:22,087 --> 01:19:24,986
Hurry up! Tommy please!

669
01:19:24,986 --> 01:19:27,686
Tommy, go upstairs. - What is it, Laurie?
- Tommy go back upstairs,

670
01:19:27,686 --> 01:19:31,086
I'm scared!- Do what I say! Now!
- It's the boogeyman, isn't it? - Hurry!

671
01:19:43,286 --> 01:19:44,786
Oh, no ...

672
01:19:59,986 --> 01:20:01,486
Please, stop.

673
01:20:01,486 --> 01:20:02,986
Please ...

674
01:21:18,086 --> 01:21:21,787
Where were you? I went to the Meyers house.
- I found the car. He is here!

675
01:21:21,787 --> 01:21:26,087
Where? - He's three blocks down.
You go around back off the houses, I'll watch the front.

676
01:21:26,286 --> 01:21:27,186
Go on!

677
01:21:57,686 --> 01:21:59,586
Tommy ... Lyndsey ...

678
01:22:01,686 --> 01:22:03,186
Babies ...

679
01:22:06,986 --> 01:22:08,787
We're gonna take a little walk.

680
01:22:08,787 --> 01:22:10,086
Was it the boogeyman?

681
01:22:10,787 --> 01:22:12,987
-I'm scared.
-There's nothing to be scared of.

682
01:22:12,987 --> 01:22:14,486
Are you sure?

683
01:22:15,786 --> 01:22:16,987
How?

684
01:22:17,286 --> 01:22:18,686
I killed him.

685
01:22:19,386 --> 01:22:21,386
You can't kill the boogeyman.

686
01:22:25,186 --> 01:22:27,786
Get in there! Come on, Tommy! Now, lock the door!

687
01:25:05,887 --> 01:25:07,286
Tommy ...

688
01:25:07,286 --> 01:25:08,586
Unlock the door.

689
01:25:12,087 --> 01:25:13,187
Come here.

690
01:25:14,087 --> 01:25:15,087
Now just listen to me ...

691
01:25:16,187 --> 01:25:17,686
I want you to go down the stairs ...

692
01:25:17,686 --> 01:25:19,287
and out the front door.

693
01:25:19,287 --> 01:25:21,686
And I want you to go down the street
to the Mackenzies' house ...

694
01:25:22,086 --> 01:25:24,286
I want you to tell them to call the police.

695
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:26,286
And tell them to send them over here.

696
01:25:26,286 --> 01:25:28,186
Laurie ...
- Now, do you understand me?

697
01:25:28,186 --> 01:25:29,787
Yes. - Go. Do as I say.

698
01:25:51,386 --> 01:25:52,386
Get help!

699
01:25:52,386 --> 01:25:53,586
Come on!

700
01:25:53,886 --> 01:25:55,186
Come on!

701
01:27:19,386 --> 01:27:21,187
Was that the boogeyman?

702
01:27:26,586 --> 01:27:28,186
As a matter of fact ...

703
01:27:28,186 --> 01:27:29,286
it was.
