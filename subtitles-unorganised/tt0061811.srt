1
00:00:21,697 --> 00:00:27,119
In the heat of the night

2
00:00:30,706 --> 00:00:36,128
Seems like a cold sweat
creepin' across my brow

3
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,339
Yeah

4
00:00:40,758 --> 00:00:45,137
In the heat of the night

5
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:54,146
I'm feelin' motherless somehow

6
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:03,780
Stars with evil eyes

7
00:01:03,905 --> 00:01:06,867
Stare from the skies

8
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:10,037
All mean and bright

9
00:01:10,162 --> 00:01:13,665
In the heat of the night

10
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:20,380
Ain't a woman yet been born

11
00:01:23,842 --> 00:01:29,514
Knows how to make the mornin' come

12
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:38,315
It's so hard to keep control

13
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,402
When I could sell my soul

14
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,363
For just a little light

15
00:01:45,488 --> 00:01:49,117
In the heat of the night

16
00:01:50,285 --> 00:01:54,831
In the heat of the night

17
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:04,174
I've got trouble wall to wall

18
00:02:05,717 --> 00:02:08,177
Oh yes, I have

19
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:10,972
I repeat

20
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,558
I repeat, in the night

21
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:22,275
Must be an ending to it all

22
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:31,826
But hold on, it won't be long

23
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,412
Just you be strong

24
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:37,999
And it'll be all right

25
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:41,794
In the heat of the night

26
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:56,225
Where you keepin' the pie tonight?

27
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:00,688
A man ate the last piece
just before you come in.

28
00:03:06,277 --> 00:03:09,530
What's that little old orphan
sittin' right up there?

29
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,867
Marble cake.

30
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:19,915
Tell you what, Sam. Bein' she's
in there by her little old lonesome,

31
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,959
I'll let you have her for free.

32
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:25,754
I told you 'bout that "Sam" business,
didn't I? Hm?

33
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:30,009
Sorry, Mr. Wood.
I mean, uh... Officer Wood.

34
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:52,197
(car starts)

35
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:16,430
(country music fades in)

36
00:04:17,472 --> 00:04:20,308
Well, a bow-legged Polly
and a knocked-kneed Paul

37
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:22,853
A bow-legged Polly
and a knocked-kneed Paul

38
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:25,522
A bow-legged Polly
and a knocked-kneed Paul

39
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:27,399
They can't get together at all

40
00:04:27,524 --> 00:04:30,610
Just like the worm in the cornfield
said to his brother

41
00:04:30,735 --> 00:04:33,655
"Yeah, go in one ear and out the other"

42
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,824
(singer hums)

43
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:49,421
Well, a bucktoothed Clara
and a cross-eyed Clyde

44
00:04:49,546 --> 00:04:51,715
A bucktoothed Clara
and a cross-eyed Clyde

45
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,926
Like old bow-legged Polly
and a knock-kneed Paul

46
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:57,095
(music stops)

47
00:06:05,246 --> 00:06:08,124
Every time I see your face

48
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:10,793
Its got a way of turnin' me around

49
00:06:22,513 --> 00:06:25,933
You tune me in, pretty baby

50
00:06:26,684 --> 00:06:28,269
Wild things begin

51
00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:31,188
Baby, that ain't love

52
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:35,192
But it sure is groovy

53
00:06:36,276 --> 00:06:38,696
(song continues in background)

54
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:46,179
(doctor) Its Colbert, all right.
Skull's caved in.

55
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:52,394
You ever take a homicide
picture before, son?

56
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,938
Well, at least he won't be movin' on me.

57
00:07:55,063 --> 00:07:59,567
That's for sure. I want you to cover every
angle. Do you hear me? Every angle.

58
00:07:59,693 --> 00:08:02,070
Uh, you boys, move on back now, OK?

59
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:05,365
Came all this way to build us a factory,

60
00:08:05,782 --> 00:08:08,243
make somethin' outta this town.

61
00:08:09,494 --> 00:08:12,038
Look what it got him.

62
00:08:13,832 --> 00:08:15,917
Yeah.

63
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:21,172
Sam, did he have a wallet,
identification, anything like that?

64
00:08:21,297 --> 00:08:24,926
That's the first thing I looked for.
Whoever fixed him musta took 'em.

65
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:26,886
Nothin'.

66
00:08:27,845 --> 00:08:30,932
- Any witnesses?
- I mean, not even a cat.

67
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:36,979
- How long's he been dead?
- Oh, less than an hour.

68
00:08:37,105 --> 00:08:40,525
- Less than an hour.
- Maybe half that.

69
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,693
Maybe half.

70
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:49,033
Could have been a hitchhiker.

71
00:08:49,158 --> 00:08:52,954
Check both ends of town, check
the depot, and check the pool hall. OK?

72
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:56,541
- Pool hall closed at one o'clock, Chief.
- I said check it, Sam.

73
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,043
Yes, sir.

74
00:10:17,621 --> 00:10:20,082
On your feet, boy.

75
00:10:24,878 --> 00:10:27,422
I mean now!

76
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,350
Get against that wall.
Get them hands high!

77
00:10:38,475 --> 00:10:41,353
Spread them fingers out.
I wanna count all ten.

78
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:49,486
You move before I tell you to, boy,
by God, I'm gonna clean your plough.

79
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:17,305
That's pretty fat there, ain't it, boy? Huh?

80
00:11:21,184 --> 00:11:25,563
Now, outside there's a police car.
You're gonna pick up that bag.

81
00:11:25,688 --> 00:11:29,400
You're gonna walk out, and you're
gonna plant yourself in the back.

82
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:32,862
And you're gonna be
a real nice quiet boy all the way in.

83
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:35,323
You hear?!

84
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:57,678
C'mon, boy.

85
00:11:57,803 --> 00:11:59,847
Move it!

86
00:12:11,734 --> 00:12:13,778
Chief here?

87
00:12:14,612 --> 00:12:16,822
- Hey, what's up, Sam?
- (Sam) Chief?

88
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:18,991
What's goin' on?

89
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:22,787
- Sam?
- (squeaking)

90
00:12:30,377 --> 00:12:32,421
(clattering)

91
00:12:33,964 --> 00:12:36,008
(quicker clattering)

92
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:56,403
- Wood?
- Yes, sir?

93
00:12:56,528 --> 00:13:00,824
When's the last time I asked Courtney
to get oil for this damn thing?

94
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:03,035
Uh, last Wednesday.

95
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:08,123
Would you be kind enough to go outside
and remind him what day it is today?

96
00:13:08,248 --> 00:13:10,751
Well, uh... how about the prisoner here?

97
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:14,338
Don't you worry about him.

98
00:13:14,463 --> 00:13:16,924
Got a name, boy?

99
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:19,092
Virgil Tibbs.

100
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:21,970
Virgil?

101
00:13:23,764 --> 00:13:28,935
Well, I don't think we're gonna
have any trouble, are we, Virgil?

102
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:32,481
No trouble at all.

103
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:42,407
Oh, you can go now, Sam.

104
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:44,576
Yes, sir.

105
00:13:49,831 --> 00:13:52,751
- What did you hit him with?
- Hit whom?

106
00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:55,503
"Whom"? Whom?

107
00:13:55,629 --> 00:14:00,425
You a Northern boy? What's a Northern
boy like you doin' all the way down here?

108
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:05,055
- I was waiting for the train.
- There ain't no trains this time of mornin'.

109
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,850
- Tuesdays only. 4.05 to Memphis.
- You say.

110
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,188
(train horn in distance)

111
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:16,983
Well... All right, you say right.

112
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,664
All right... Virgil.

113
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:35,084
Oh!

114
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:37,253
Now look.

115
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:42,967
I try to run a nice, clean, safe town here.

116
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:48,723
A town where a man can sneeze and not
get his brains beat out. You follow me?

117
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:51,309
Yes.

118
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:56,606
Why don't you tell me how you killed
Mr. Colbert? You'll feel a whole lot better.

119
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:58,858
(knocking)

120
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:01,235
Not now!

121
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:19,003
I was visiting my mother.

122
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:22,340
I came in on the 12.35 from Brownsville.

123
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:26,761
I was waiting to go out on the 4.05.

124
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:32,141
Mm-hm.

125
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:44,778
Yeah.

126
00:15:44,904 --> 00:15:49,825
And meanwhile, you killed yourself
a white man and picked yourself up $200!

127
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,786
I earned that money,
ten hours a day, seven days a week.

128
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:58,542
Coloured can't earn that. Its more than I
make in a month! Where did you earn it?!

129
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,753
- Philadelphia.
- Mississippi?

130
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:04,214
- Pennsylvania.
- Just how do you earn that kinda money?

131
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,800
I'm a police officer.

132
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,310
(throws badge on desk)

133
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,549
Oh, yeah.

134
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,979
- Wood!
- Yes, sir!

135
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,234
- Did you question this man?
- No, sir.

136
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,824
Would you mind taking a look at that?

137
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:19,497
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

138
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:26,296
I'll check on this wise city boy.
You take him outside and hold him.

139
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,964
Yes, sir.

140
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:32,343
May I suggest that you call my chief
rather than send a wire or anything?

141
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:36,806
I mean, it would be quicker.
And I'll pay for the call.

142
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,518
Did you hear? Did you hear him
say he'd pay for the call?

143
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,605
How much do they pay you
to do their police work?

144
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,733
$162.39 per week.

145
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:47,859
(whistles)

146
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:52,238
$162.39 a week!

147
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:56,534
Well, boy! Take him outside, Wood.
But treat him easy,

148
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:00,913
because a man that
makes $162.39 a week -

149
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,416
man, we do not wanna ruffle him!

150
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,669
No, sir!

151
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:19,890
Courtney... would you try
and get me long-distance?

152
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:33,320
(Courtney) Police business, honey.
Chief's on the line.

153
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:38,033
No. He catch you listenin' in,
he'll run your butt around the block.

154
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,703
- He don't panic me none.
- No?

155
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,291
- Where's the chief?
- You got the pictures of the dead man?

156
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,794
Sure do. I got him top,
bottom, sideways-you name it.

157
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,047
- Good. I'll take 'em, son.
- No, I wanna give 'em to the chief.

158
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,593
- I said I'd take 'em, Charlie.
- Do like he tells you, Charlie.

159
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,970
Somebody owes me
some money for those.

160
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,140
I had to buy paper and film
and developin'.

161
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:05,811
That's all right. Just bill the department.
Everything will be taken care of.

162
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,898
God Almighty. He sure looks bad.

163
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,821
May I see the man
I am supposed to have killed?

164
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,700
Sure. I don't know why not.

165
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:24,204
(whispers) Hey, Sam. He's finished talkin'.

166
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:30,043
- Here's the photos of the dead man.
- OK.

167
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,673
Got your chief on the phone.
He wants to talk to you.

168
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,599
Hello? Yes, sir. I'm sorry
to have gotten you involved in this.

169
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,185
I really had no choice.

170
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,565
Yes, sir.

171
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:57,445
You can't be serious, sir. I mean, even
if I could be of help, they wouldn't want it.

172
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,491
No, sir. I'm not prejudiced.

173
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:07,163
Yes, sir. I am a police officer
and they're police officers, but...

174
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,715
Hello. This is Gillespie.
Yes, sir. Yep, well...

175
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,884
You don't say?

176
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,096
He's your number one homicide expert?

177
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:25,181
Well, my, my, my.

178
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:28,560
I don't think we need any help.
We can wrap this up ourselves.

179
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,020
Yes, sir. But I do want to thank you

180
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:35,692
for offering me such a powerful piece
of manpower as Virgil Tibbs.

181
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,695
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Yeah. Goodbye, now.

182
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:46,119
Oh, it's all there.
We paid for the phone call ourselves.

183
00:20:51,624 --> 00:20:54,168
Now, you are the number one
homicide expert.

184
00:20:54,293 --> 00:20:58,214
- That's right.
- I bet you look at a lot of dead bodies.

185
00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:00,299
Lots.

186
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,260
Well?

187
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:05,972
- Well, what?
- Well...

188
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:10,726
I just thought maybe, uh... Maybe you
wouldn't mind takin' a look at this one?

189
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,437
No, thanks.

190
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,649
- Why not, expert?
- Because I've got a train to catch.

191
00:21:16,774 --> 00:21:19,443
Wait a minute.
That train don't leave till noon.

192
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:24,115
They pay you $162.39 a week just to look
at bodies. Why can't you look at this one?

193
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,577
- Why can't you look at it for yourself?
- Because I'm not an expert...

194
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:29,829
Officer!

195
00:21:39,422 --> 00:21:44,927
Ten cents, ten million dollars-just
doesn't matter when a man's time comes.

196
00:21:45,052 --> 00:21:46,929
Mm-hm.

197
00:21:47,054 --> 00:21:50,015
I could give him a nicer service
right here in Sparta

198
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,353
than he could ever get up there
in Chicago. And at half the price, too.

199
00:21:54,478 --> 00:21:57,565
- I got a rosewood casket out there...
- (door opens)

200
00:21:58,983 --> 00:22:01,735
Ted Ulam, Chief.
We haven't had the pleasure.

201
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,904
That's for sure.

202
00:22:06,031 --> 00:22:08,075
He's with me.

203
00:22:10,452 --> 00:22:12,496
Hello, Doc.

204
00:22:14,456 --> 00:22:16,291
Yep.

205
00:22:23,382 --> 00:22:25,217
Well...

206
00:22:25,717 --> 00:22:27,553
Uh...

207
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,056
Do you wanna look at it?

208
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,794
(Virgil) New manicure. That's good.

209
00:23:06,508 --> 00:23:08,552
That's very good.

210
00:23:24,025 --> 00:23:26,945
- I'll need a few things.
- (Gillespie) Such as?

211
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:31,699
Ammonium hydrosulphide,
benzidine, superoxide of hydrogen.

212
00:23:33,618 --> 00:23:36,412
Copper powder, distilled water.

213
00:23:47,423 --> 00:23:49,884
A six-inch celluloid scale.

214
00:23:50,802 --> 00:23:52,637
Thermometer.

215
00:23:53,263 --> 00:23:55,306
Some tweezers.

216
00:23:56,641 --> 00:23:59,560
Callipers. And some toothpicks.

217
00:23:59,686 --> 00:24:02,689
Toothpicks?! Copper...?
What's goin' on here, Chief?

218
00:24:02,814 --> 00:24:04,816
Who is this boy anyway?

219
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:08,403
I asked him to look at the body.
That's who he is.

220
00:24:08,528 --> 00:24:10,905
Its 4.45. What time was this man killed?

221
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:16,619
Sam found him at 3am. The doctor says
it's possible he was killed an hour earlier.

222
00:24:16,744 --> 00:24:19,705
- At two?
- Maybe a little later.

223
00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:22,458
2.15... 2.30?

224
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,127
Would you feel the face and jaw, please?

225
00:24:25,836 --> 00:24:28,381
Am I mistaken, or has rigor begun?

226
00:24:29,715 --> 00:24:31,550
It has.

227
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,930
You'll notice too
that postmortem lividity is present.

228
00:24:36,055 --> 00:24:39,975
So the time of death really has
to be earlier. Wouldn't you say?

229
00:24:40,685 --> 00:24:41,686
Mm.

230
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:45,606
Well, we'll be able to pinpoint that
as soon as I get a thermometer.

231
00:24:45,731 --> 00:24:49,819
As you know, the loss of heat from
the brain is the most reliable way

232
00:24:49,944 --> 00:24:52,404
of determining time of death.

233
00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:54,949
Right, Chief?

234
00:24:56,742 --> 00:24:58,327
Oh, yeah.

235
00:25:02,122 --> 00:25:03,958
Well...

236
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:08,796
Which one of you gentlemen
will assist me?

237
00:25:15,344 --> 00:25:17,388
(phone rings)

238
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:21,725
Ulam's Funer... Its for you, Chief.

239
00:25:25,521 --> 00:25:27,356
Yeah. Talk to me.

240
00:25:27,481 --> 00:25:29,316
When?

241
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:34,363
Oh, good. Yeah, yeah. Right away. I've
got a runaway suspect, boy. I gotta go.

242
00:25:35,113 --> 00:25:39,743
Now listen, you. Anything he wants,
man, you better see that he gets it.

243
00:25:43,538 --> 00:25:45,999
Where can I wash my hands?

244
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,683
(dogs barking in the distance)

245
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:30,085
(grunt)

246
00:26:42,931 --> 00:26:45,391
(dogs barking with excitement)

247
00:27:20,301 --> 00:27:23,971
This here's Shagbag, you hear?
He's headed for the river.

248
00:27:25,014 --> 00:27:27,892
The river, you hear?
He's gonna be in Arkansas.

249
00:27:28,893 --> 00:27:30,144
Shoot.

250
00:27:30,394 --> 00:27:32,438
(train horn)

251
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:16,875
OK. I got him.

252
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:25,443
Mrs. Colbert.

253
00:30:26,235 --> 00:30:30,364
- How is she taking it?
- Chief had to leave. She don't know it yet.

254
00:30:38,456 --> 00:30:40,917
Hey! You can't go in there, boy!

255
00:30:45,796 --> 00:30:48,424
- Mrs. Colbert?
- Where's my husband?

256
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,721
What's happened to him? Why won't
anybody tell me what's happened to him?

257
00:30:53,846 --> 00:30:57,600
Why won't anybody here tell me?
I have a right to know if he's hurt,

258
00:30:57,725 --> 00:31:01,103
if he's been in an accident.
I want to know if he is all right!

259
00:31:01,228 --> 00:31:03,564
Your husband is dead, Mrs. Colbert.

260
00:31:06,108 --> 00:31:07,818
Uh...

261
00:31:07,943 --> 00:31:09,987
Somebody killed him.

262
00:31:11,447 --> 00:31:13,908
We don't know who-yet.

263
00:31:36,638 --> 00:31:38,474
Its, uh...

264
00:31:40,476 --> 00:31:42,769
Its very hot in here.

265
00:31:42,895 --> 00:31:45,355
Its very hot in this room.

266
00:31:50,444 --> 00:31:52,279
Sit down.

267
00:31:53,113 --> 00:31:54,948
No.

268
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:16,344
(sobs)

269
00:32:19,556 --> 00:32:21,391
Would you...

270
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:30,984
Would you... leave me alone
for a few minutes, please?

271
00:32:50,837 --> 00:32:52,881
(sobs)

272
00:32:56,926 --> 00:32:58,970
(sobbing continues)

273
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:27,165
Virgil, we don't need you or your
microscopes. Tell that to your chief.

274
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:29,750
We don't need him-or you.

275
00:33:30,501 --> 00:33:32,962
Mrs. Colbert's in there.

276
00:33:33,754 --> 00:33:36,966
- I've already told her.
- I see.

277
00:33:37,091 --> 00:33:41,178
Here is the examination results from
Ulam's. You wanna know what I found?

278
00:33:41,304 --> 00:33:44,181
No. I don't need to look at 'em now.

279
00:33:44,307 --> 00:33:46,642
May I examine this prisoner?

280
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:49,854
Yeah, you can look at him.
C'mon, let him look. Go on.

281
00:34:11,876 --> 00:34:14,503
All right, now! Steady!

282
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,424
You finished?

283
00:34:19,466 --> 00:34:21,510
Thank you.

284
00:34:23,554 --> 00:34:26,432
All right, Fryer, bring him with me.

285
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:33,647
- Now we're grindin' corn!
- You shoulda been there!

286
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:37,568
lf it weren't for them radios,
we woulda lost him goin' over that bridge.

287
00:34:37,693 --> 00:34:40,696
That old boy highballing that train
like to cut us off.

288
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:42,990
And old Charlie's hound dog got loose...

289
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:44,908
- Did he confess?
- Huh?

290
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:48,537
The man you arrested, did he confess?

291
00:34:48,662 --> 00:34:51,123
Well, I believe he will.

292
00:34:51,248 --> 00:34:53,792
Yes siree, I believe he will.

293
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:56,128
I believe he will.

294
00:34:56,253 --> 00:34:59,089
- He's left-handed, isn't he?
- How do I know?

295
00:34:59,506 --> 00:35:01,925
Well, he seemed left-handed to me.

296
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:06,388
I believe Harvey is a southpaw.
Now, ain't he, Shagbag?

297
00:35:06,513 --> 00:35:09,016
What if he is? What's that make him?

298
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,519
Innocent.

299
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,816
Mrs. Colbert... There's just one more thing.

300
00:35:26,283 --> 00:35:27,993
Yeah.

301
00:35:28,118 --> 00:35:33,456
I picked it up, I tell you. He was already
lyin' there. It was lyin' there next to him!

302
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:37,752
I just picked it up, ma'am. That's all I did.

303
00:35:37,877 --> 00:35:39,796
Shut up.

304
00:35:39,921 --> 00:35:43,008
- Get him outta here.
- OK. C'mon, Harvey. Let's go.

305
00:35:56,271 --> 00:36:00,817
Mrs. Colbert, I, uh... I wonder if you'd mind
if I have somebody drive you over

306
00:36:00,942 --> 00:36:05,488
so you could, uh...
complete the identification?

307
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:30,346
Martin, I want you to take
Mrs. Colbert over to the funeral parlour.

308
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:32,557
And, Wood, run Virgil down the depot.

309
00:36:32,682 --> 00:36:37,353
Uh... Virge here, Chief,
he thinks that Harvey's innocent.

310
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,692
- Well, I'll be damned.
- Could I talk to you about it, in private?

311
00:36:42,817 --> 00:36:47,280
No. Because I got Colbert's wallet in my
hand, and we took it from Harvey Oberst.

312
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,532
- You think he gave it to him?
- I don't know.

313
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:53,828
But Oberst could have come along
after the crime, found it, picked it up.

314
00:36:53,953 --> 00:36:57,206
- I don't know.
- That's what the boy said he did.

315
00:36:58,374 --> 00:37:01,252
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am, but I say different.

316
00:37:01,377 --> 00:37:04,880
When I examined the deceased,
it was obvious the fatal blow was struck

317
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:07,174
from an angle of
17 degrees from the right,

318
00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:11,345
which makes it almost certain
the person who did it is right-handed.

319
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:14,473
- So what?
- (Shagbag) Harve's left-handed, Chief.

320
00:37:14,598 --> 00:37:17,685
- Everybody in town knows that.
- We figured that out.

321
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,271
Harvey's a lefty. Uh-huh.

322
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:28,028
You're sure of yourself, Virgil. Funny
name for a nigger boy from Philadelphia.

323
00:37:28,153 --> 00:37:32,616
- What do they call you up there?
- They call me Mr. Tibbs!

324
00:37:32,741 --> 00:37:36,787
Mr. Tibbs! Well, Mr. Wood, take Mr. Tibbs,
take him down to the depot.

325
00:37:36,912 --> 00:37:39,790
And I mean, boy, like now!

326
00:37:48,674 --> 00:37:52,261
I'll have the FBI lab
send you the report on this.

327
00:37:53,595 --> 00:37:55,722
Not that it'll make any difference.

328
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,684
I'll take that.

329
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,437
No, you won't.

330
00:38:05,941 --> 00:38:09,278
I'm sending it in personally.

331
00:38:13,448 --> 00:38:15,909
(Mrs. Colbert) My God!

332
00:38:18,203 --> 00:38:20,747
What kind of people are you?

333
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:24,459
What kind of a place is this?

334
00:38:29,422 --> 00:38:31,341
My husband is dead.

335
00:38:31,466 --> 00:38:35,929
Somebody in this town killed him!
I want you to find out who!

336
00:38:50,694 --> 00:38:53,154
You gonna give me that?

337
00:38:55,198 --> 00:38:57,242
No, I'm not.

338
00:39:00,036 --> 00:39:02,455
Wood, you take him,

339
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,667
and you lock him up
for withholding evidence.

340
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,964
Go on, move! Put him with
his friend, Harvey Oberst!

341
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:24,060
Well, Virgil, nobody threw your brains
to the hogs, that's for damn sure.

342
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,440
Hold on there, Arnold. Open her up again.
We got another customer.

343
00:39:31,693 --> 00:39:33,736
(Harvey) Hey, man, not in here.

344
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:37,073
- Put him somewheres else!
- Don't push the panic button.

345
00:39:37,198 --> 00:39:40,076
Play it cool, boy. Play it cool.

346
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,203
Hey!

347
00:39:42,453 --> 00:39:44,497
- Hey!
- (door shuts)

348
00:39:50,628 --> 00:39:53,714
What you doin'
wearin' white man's clothes?

349
00:39:55,883 --> 00:39:57,677
Where d'you come from?

350
00:40:00,805 --> 00:40:03,349
You deaf or somethin'?

351
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:07,645
Listen, I'm get...

352
00:40:08,396 --> 00:40:11,190
Keep cool, Harvey.

353
00:40:15,945 --> 00:40:18,823
I'm on your side.

354
00:40:18,948 --> 00:40:20,908
Well, I don't need you!

355
00:40:21,033 --> 00:40:23,077
I'm all you've got.

356
00:40:32,086 --> 00:40:34,296
Police?

357
00:40:35,297 --> 00:40:37,841
You're a cop?

358
00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:40,678
- You're a cop.
- Mm-hm.

359
00:40:40,803 --> 00:40:42,638
Yeah?

360
00:40:43,472 --> 00:40:46,558
So, how come they locked you up?
How come they lock up a cop?

361
00:40:46,684 --> 00:40:48,977
Who said they locked me up?

362
00:40:49,103 --> 00:40:53,732
How come with all these empty cells here
they'd throw me in with you? You dig?

363
00:40:58,862 --> 00:41:00,906
Look.

364
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,784
I already told 'em.

365
00:41:04,952 --> 00:41:07,746
I see this fella lyin' on the street there.

366
00:41:09,373 --> 00:41:12,251
And there's this wallet lyin' beside him.

367
00:41:14,586 --> 00:41:17,130
Boy, I mean, I come into
this world outta luck.

368
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:20,842
Here's the first good thing
to come my way. And I pick it up.

369
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:25,263
But when I see whose wallet it is...

370
00:41:26,264 --> 00:41:31,812
I mean, I start to sweat. But I heard
about this new chief. This Gillepsbie?

371
00:41:31,937 --> 00:41:34,106
Got no more smile than a turnip.

372
00:41:34,231 --> 00:41:38,527
So I cut across the fields, headin' for the
line, and got myself as far as the bridge

373
00:41:38,652 --> 00:41:40,862
before Gillepsbie grabbed me.

374
00:41:40,987 --> 00:41:43,448
What time did you find the wallet?

375
00:41:44,616 --> 00:41:50,330
Well, I ain't got no watch, but it must have
been after two, by the courthouse clock.

376
00:41:50,455 --> 00:41:53,833
I'm interested in eleven to two.
Where were you?

377
00:41:53,959 --> 00:41:57,754
Shootin' pool. Larry's Lounge.
I got there about ten.

378
00:41:57,879 --> 00:42:00,840
- What time'd you leave?
- Closin'. Must have been one.

379
00:42:00,965 --> 00:42:05,095
- Anybody can swear for you?
- Packy, Bert, Les.

380
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:11,976
Ever been in trouble
with the police before?

381
00:42:14,229 --> 00:42:16,105
Come on.

382
00:42:16,564 --> 00:42:19,359
I could ask at the desk, you know.

383
00:42:23,863 --> 00:42:26,824
Well, they brought me in one time.

384
00:42:27,909 --> 00:42:30,995
- On account of this Delores Purdy.
- On what charge?

385
00:42:35,124 --> 00:42:37,919
Well, uh, this Delores, she, uh...

386
00:42:39,837 --> 00:42:43,341
she's real proud of what nature
done for her, you know?

387
00:42:44,008 --> 00:42:45,885
And, uh...

388
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:50,473
Well, we was on a date
up to Clarke's Point, and, uh...

389
00:42:51,974 --> 00:42:54,644
she says, uh... (sniggers)

390
00:42:55,144 --> 00:42:58,147
Anyway, she asks me, she says, uh...

391
00:42:58,272 --> 00:43:01,609
"Don't you think I got a classy build?"

392
00:43:01,734 --> 00:43:03,945
And I say "Sure."

393
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,906
And so she starts to show me.

394
00:43:07,907 --> 00:43:10,451
But I didn't do nothin' wrong.

395
00:43:10,576 --> 00:43:14,080
I just didn't stop her from
tryin' to prove her point.

396
00:43:15,289 --> 00:43:18,000
Then this cop, Sam Wood,

397
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:21,253
comes chargin' outta the bush
and hauls me in.

398
00:43:21,629 --> 00:43:24,006
He let you go, didn't he?

399
00:43:24,131 --> 00:43:27,760
Told me not to mess with her no more.
She lives on Third, a block from me.

400
00:43:27,885 --> 00:43:30,846
Traipsin' around in the altogether.
With the lights on.

401
00:43:30,971 --> 00:43:34,725
Now, somebody sure oughta
make her stop doin' that.

402
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,894
Come here.

403
00:43:39,939 --> 00:43:42,399
Let me see your right hand.

404
00:43:46,945 --> 00:43:49,490
- What you doin'?
- Hold still.

405
00:43:58,207 --> 00:44:00,250
(door opens)

406
00:44:10,636 --> 00:44:13,931
All right now, give him
the waiver for false arrest.

407
00:44:14,765 --> 00:44:16,600
(Virgil) Forget it.

408
00:44:16,725 --> 00:44:19,603
I'm askin' you to sign it. Please.

409
00:44:23,565 --> 00:44:26,026
Give him a pen. Give him a pen.

410
00:44:36,953 --> 00:44:39,414
All right. Let him out.

411
00:44:45,921 --> 00:44:49,257
You'll be able to catch the 12.10 train.

412
00:44:52,177 --> 00:44:55,347
It wouldn't be a bad idea
to change the charge against Oberst.

413
00:44:55,472 --> 00:45:00,352
He was nowhere near the scene
of the crime, and I think he can prove it.

414
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:04,814
- I bet you know when Colbert was killed.
- About 12.30.

415
00:45:04,939 --> 00:45:08,860
- While Harvey was still shooting pool.
- Wait a minute. I'll get it.

416
00:45:10,779 --> 00:45:13,698
There's cue chalk under his nails,
not dried blood.

417
00:45:13,823 --> 00:45:17,035
- Thank God I don't live in Philadelphia.
- One more thing.

418
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,746
Colbert wasn't killed
where the body was found.

419
00:45:19,871 --> 00:45:23,458
- What do you mean?
- He was killed then moved to Main Street.

420
00:45:34,844 --> 00:45:36,888
- Courtney?
- Yes, sir?

421
00:45:39,057 --> 00:45:41,809
Change the charge to theft.

422
00:45:41,934 --> 00:45:44,270
D'you mean Harve?

423
00:45:44,395 --> 00:45:47,106
Who the hell else do we have back there?!

424
00:45:47,231 --> 00:45:49,275
Yes, sir.

425
00:45:52,445 --> 00:45:54,489
Hey.

426
00:45:55,448 --> 00:45:57,492
Didn't I ask you to fix that gate?

427
00:45:58,784 --> 00:46:03,539
No, not me, sir. Must have been
my brother Harold. He's on days.

428
00:46:04,165 --> 00:46:06,584
Harold.

429
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:13,174
(slams door)

430
00:46:15,301 --> 00:46:17,762
(phone rings)

431
00:46:17,887 --> 00:46:19,764
Police department.

432
00:46:19,889 --> 00:46:21,932
Yes, he's here. Hold on, sir.

433
00:46:22,808 --> 00:46:24,435
Mayor's on the line, Chief.

434
00:47:11,732 --> 00:47:13,775
(machinery noise/hammering)

435
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:35,047
What's all this Miz Colbert's been
tellin' me about a... a cover-up arrest?

436
00:47:36,965 --> 00:47:39,593
No, ma'am. We ain't had no cover-up.

437
00:47:39,718 --> 00:47:43,889
In fact, we just dropped the charges
for insufficient evidence.

438
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:47,601
Miz Colbert, I told you
he was nobody's man.

439
00:47:48,393 --> 00:47:51,897
I came by to make it
as clear as I possibly can

440
00:47:52,022 --> 00:47:56,151
that I do not want that Negro officer
taken off this case.

441
00:47:58,612 --> 00:48:00,655
Negro officer?

442
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:05,994
Yeah, well, he, uh...
He comes from up North, you see.

443
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:08,663
And he was, uh, kinda...

444
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:15,336
- passin' through...
- lf it wasn't for him,

445
00:48:15,462 --> 00:48:19,883
your impartial chief of police would still
have the wrong man behind bars.

446
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:24,971
I want that officer given a free hand.

447
00:48:25,096 --> 00:48:29,642
Otherwise, I will pack up
my husband's engineers...

448
00:48:33,104 --> 00:48:35,148
and leave you...

449
00:48:37,108 --> 00:48:39,152
to yourselves.

450
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:48,911
Miz Colbert, now don't you
worry about a thing.

451
00:48:49,037 --> 00:48:52,123
Believe me, we're gonna
take care of everything.

452
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:55,752
Bill?

453
00:49:01,716 --> 00:49:05,011
I wanna see you come through
this now, you hear?

454
00:49:05,136 --> 00:49:08,681
Even if we have to
step on Endicott's toes?

455
00:49:08,806 --> 00:49:10,808
Even that.

456
00:49:10,933 --> 00:49:12,977
But do it fast.

457
00:49:14,312 --> 00:49:16,272
All right.

458
00:49:16,397 --> 00:49:19,233
Now, Bill, how about
this here Negro officer?

459
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:21,902
Miz Colbert seems
to have confidence in him.

460
00:49:22,028 --> 00:49:24,572
Oh, he ain't nothin'. Some kind of a...

461
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,827
some kind of a homicide expert.
But I don't need him.

462
00:49:31,704 --> 00:49:35,207
You mean you don't want him.
But you do need him.

463
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:40,504
Now look, Bill.
Suppose he turns up the killer.

464
00:49:40,629 --> 00:49:46,010
He has no police power here. He's gonna
have to hand him over on a platter, right?

465
00:49:46,135 --> 00:49:47,928
That's right.

466
00:49:48,053 --> 00:49:53,976
And if he fails, you're off the hook, cos it
was Miz Colbert's idea in the first place.

467
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:56,520
See what I mean?

468
00:49:56,645 --> 00:49:58,772
Oh, yeah.

469
00:49:58,897 --> 00:50:01,984
Works out all the way around, Bill.
For all of us.

470
00:50:03,235 --> 00:50:05,279
Excuse me.

471
00:50:37,811 --> 00:50:40,355
Any reason why you have to leave today?

472
00:50:41,106 --> 00:50:43,150
There's lots of reasons.

473
00:50:44,526 --> 00:50:48,405
What would you say if
I asked you to stay for a while?

474
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:50,365
No.

475
00:51:02,919 --> 00:51:05,922
This town needs a factory, Virgil.

476
00:51:06,047 --> 00:51:08,633
Colbert come down
from Chicago to build it.

477
00:51:08,758 --> 00:51:12,887
I hear they're gonna hire a thousand men.
Half of them'd be coloured.

478
00:51:13,847 --> 00:51:17,142
- Know what that means?
- Probably got him killed.

479
00:51:17,267 --> 00:51:21,271
That's what Mrs. Colbert thinks.
She wants us to catch her a killer.

480
00:51:21,396 --> 00:51:24,149
No killer, no factory.

481
00:51:24,274 --> 00:51:28,486
Well, it's a lotta jobs for a lotta
coloured people. You follow me?

482
00:51:30,613 --> 00:51:33,032
- I'm going home, man.
- They're your people.

483
00:51:33,158 --> 00:51:36,536
Not mine-yours. You made this scene.

484
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:41,291
- What do you want me to do? Beg you?
- Look, I've had your town up to here!

485
00:51:41,874 --> 00:51:46,129
Boy, it would give me a world
of satisfaction to horsewhip you, Virgil!

486
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,721
My father used to say that.

487
00:51:57,932 --> 00:52:02,103
- Even did, once or twice.
- Yeah, well, not enough to suit me.

488
00:52:03,479 --> 00:52:05,982
Now you listen to me.

489
00:52:06,107 --> 00:52:08,776
Just once in my life
I'm gonna hold my temper.

490
00:52:08,901 --> 00:52:11,112
I'm tellin' you that you're gonna stay.

491
00:52:11,237 --> 00:52:15,783
You'll stay here if I have to have your
chief remind you what he told you to do.

492
00:52:15,908 --> 00:52:18,327
But I don't think
I have to do that, you see?

493
00:52:18,452 --> 00:52:22,748
No. Because you're so damned smart.
You're smarter than any white man.

494
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,543
You're just gonna stay here
and show us all.

495
00:52:25,668 --> 00:52:29,964
You could never live with yourself
unless you could put us all to shame.

496
00:52:31,841 --> 00:52:34,385
You wanna know something, Virgil?

497
00:52:35,469 --> 00:52:40,099
I don't think that you could let
an opportunity like that pass by.

498
00:52:56,365 --> 00:52:58,409
(train horn)

499
00:53:20,722 --> 00:53:22,808
Jess?

500
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:24,852
Jess, this is, uh...

501
00:53:24,977 --> 00:53:27,604
This is Virgil. He's workin' for me.

502
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,691
Give him somethin' that runs. Fix him up.

503
00:53:30,816 --> 00:53:34,278
What I fix, runs. Who pays?

504
00:53:34,528 --> 00:53:36,363
Police.

505
00:53:38,115 --> 00:53:41,368
Well, you know where to find me.

506
00:54:20,949 --> 00:54:23,076
What you doin' here, man?

507
00:54:23,201 --> 00:54:25,370
Policeman.

508
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:28,581
You're a policeman here in Sparta?

509
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:32,794
They've got a murder
they don't know what to do with.

510
00:54:32,919 --> 00:54:35,380
They need a whipping boy.

511
00:54:43,555 --> 00:54:46,015
You got a roof?

512
00:54:46,849 --> 00:54:50,019
No. I'll find a motel.

513
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:52,397
(Jess chuckles)

514
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:58,236
Viola... We got company.

515
00:55:06,035 --> 00:55:08,538
Know what's gonna happen?

516
00:55:08,663 --> 00:55:10,706
He gonna get hisself killed.

517
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:14,377
You watch and see he don't.

518
00:55:14,502 --> 00:55:18,214
I'm aware of the risk, Tom.
But, like it or not, we're stuck with him.

519
00:55:18,339 --> 00:55:21,342
Not if the chief here is right on the ball.

520
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:28,266
What do you say, Chief? You got that old
killer all lined up in your front sights, hm?

521
00:55:29,934 --> 00:55:32,311
I'm workin' on it.

522
00:55:32,436 --> 00:55:34,689
Tom, climb off of Gillespie's back now.

523
00:55:34,814 --> 00:55:38,734
You know damn well we didn't
hire him off a homicide squad.

524
00:55:39,819 --> 00:55:42,738
Yeah, well, it's gonna be his week.

525
00:55:42,863 --> 00:55:45,783
Cos Colbert's only the start.

526
00:55:45,908 --> 00:55:48,202
I say this nigger won't live past Saturday.

527
00:55:59,964 --> 00:56:04,176
Mrs. Colbert, can you tell me
about your husband's enemies?

528
00:56:04,301 --> 00:56:08,472
That's Endicott.
He's been fighting us all the way.

529
00:56:08,597 --> 00:56:12,685
He sits up on his hill
and runs this county.

530
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:15,437
Or did, until we moved in.

531
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:22,945
Did your husband tell you
where he was going last night?

532
00:56:24,655 --> 00:56:28,992
He said he wasn't sleepy. I went to bed.

533
00:56:29,368 --> 00:56:31,912
What time was that?

534
00:56:32,746 --> 00:56:35,249
A little after 11, I think.

535
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:39,878
Did he call you, or anybody
on your staff, after 11?

536
00:56:40,879 --> 00:56:42,714
No.

537
00:56:44,257 --> 00:56:48,220
Maybe the elevator boy
can tell us what time he went out.

538
00:56:48,345 --> 00:56:50,722
They put it on self-service after ten.

539
00:56:55,685 --> 00:56:58,063
Did your husband use a car here?

540
00:58:16,224 --> 00:58:18,434
Find anything?

541
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,188
- Whoever killed Colbert drove this car.
- How do you know?

542
00:58:24,315 --> 00:58:26,359
Where you goin'?

543
00:58:27,777 --> 00:58:32,740
I'd drive up there, but I'm sure you don't
want me running up there by myself.

544
00:58:32,865 --> 00:58:34,909
- Up where?
- Eric Endicott's.

545
00:58:35,034 --> 00:58:36,577
Endicott's?! Come on, now!

546
00:58:44,251 --> 00:58:47,338
("In the Heat of the Night" instrumental)

547
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:29,213
None of that for you, huh, Virgil?

548
00:59:36,595 --> 00:59:40,599
In the heat of the night

549
00:59:40,724 --> 00:59:44,561
Mm-hm, ain't a woman yet been born

550
00:59:47,606 --> 00:59:49,691
Yeah

551
00:59:51,276 --> 00:59:55,781
Knows how to make the mornin' come

552
01:00:00,285 --> 01:00:04,623
Its so hard to keep control

553
01:00:04,748 --> 01:00:06,374
Yes, it is

554
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:10,378
When I could sell my soul

555
01:00:11,546 --> 01:00:13,757
For just a little light

556
01:00:13,882 --> 01:00:18,011
In the heat of the night

557
01:00:34,486 --> 01:00:37,155
Listen. You know
something I don't know?

558
01:00:38,698 --> 01:00:41,993
I found a piece of osmunda
in Colbert's car.

559
01:00:42,118 --> 01:00:45,789
- A piece of what?
- On the brake pedal. Osmunda. Fern root.

560
01:00:45,914 --> 01:00:49,626
Fern root? Oh, is Mr. Endicott here?

561
01:00:49,751 --> 01:00:53,379
Yes, sir. He's out in the greenhouse.
Would you follow me, please?

562
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:21,491
- Gillespie.
- Mr. Endicott.

563
01:01:22,575 --> 01:01:24,744
This here's Virgil.

564
01:01:25,786 --> 01:01:28,664
- Mr. Tibbs.
- How do you do, sir?

565
01:01:28,789 --> 01:01:32,460
Oh, may I have Henry fetch you
somethin'? Some light refreshment?

566
01:01:32,585 --> 01:01:37,506
- No, thank you. We're all right...
- I'll have something cold, soft. Anything.

567
01:01:37,632 --> 01:01:40,593
Henry, bring in a pitcher of lemonade.
I'll have one, too.

568
01:01:40,718 --> 01:01:42,762
Yes, sir.

569
01:01:44,096 --> 01:01:47,266
I didn't know it was possible
to grow this species locally.

570
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,727
- Oh, you like flowers?
- I do.

571
01:01:49,852 --> 01:01:52,188
Mr. Tibbs, do you know
anything about orchids?

572
01:01:52,313 --> 01:01:56,233
- Not very much, but I do like them.
- Well, let me show you.

573
01:01:59,195 --> 01:02:01,238
Endicott's folly.

574
01:02:04,617 --> 01:02:08,829
- What do you think?
- Its beautiful. Its breathtaking.

575
01:02:08,954 --> 01:02:13,834
- Have you a favourite, Mr. Tibbs?
- Well, I'm partial to any of the epiphytics.

576
01:02:13,959 --> 01:02:16,420
Why, isn't that remarkable!

577
01:02:17,296 --> 01:02:21,091
That of all the orchids in this place,
you should prefer the epiphytics.

578
01:02:21,216 --> 01:02:23,260
I wonder if you know why.

579
01:02:24,053 --> 01:02:26,472
Maybe it would be helpful if you'd tell me.

580
01:02:26,597 --> 01:02:29,558
Because, like the Negro,

581
01:02:29,683 --> 01:02:33,520
they need care and feedin' and cultivatin'.

582
01:02:34,605 --> 01:02:36,648
And that takes time.

583
01:02:38,275 --> 01:02:41,820
That's somethin' you can't make
some people understand.

584
01:02:41,945 --> 01:02:45,199
That's somethin'
Mr. Colbert didn't realise.

585
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:54,666
Is this what the epiphytics root in?

586
01:02:54,791 --> 01:02:57,502
My point! They thrive on it.

587
01:02:57,628 --> 01:03:00,339
Take it away from them, they do poorly.

588
01:03:01,048 --> 01:03:04,760
- What do you call this material?
- That's osmunda. Fern root.

589
01:03:11,099 --> 01:03:15,812
Well, we don't wanna take
any more of your time, Mr. Endicott.

590
01:03:19,441 --> 01:03:21,818
Why'd you two come here?

591
01:03:29,284 --> 01:03:31,911
To ask you about Mr. Colbert.

592
01:03:35,373 --> 01:03:38,251
Let me understand this.

593
01:03:38,376 --> 01:03:42,130
You two came here... to question me?

594
01:03:45,383 --> 01:03:48,136
Well, your...

595
01:03:48,261 --> 01:03:50,472
your attitudes, Mr. Endicott,

596
01:03:50,597 --> 01:03:54,017
your points of view,
are a matter of record.

597
01:03:55,185 --> 01:03:58,521
Some people - let us say
the people who work for Mr. Colbert -

598
01:03:58,646 --> 01:04:03,234
might reasonably regard you as the
person least likely to mourn his passing.

599
01:04:05,153 --> 01:04:08,656
We were just trying
to clarify some of the evidence.

600
01:04:09,907 --> 01:04:14,620
Was Mr. Colbert ever in this greenhouse?
Say, last night, about midnight?

601
01:04:21,169 --> 01:04:22,962
Gillespie?

602
01:04:23,087 --> 01:04:25,089
Yeah?

603
01:04:25,214 --> 01:04:29,051
- You saw it.
- Oh, I saw it.

604
01:04:29,844 --> 01:04:33,472
What are you gonna do about it?

605
01:04:35,474 --> 01:04:38,352
I don't know.

606
01:04:38,769 --> 01:04:40,813
I'll remember that.

607
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:49,238
There was a time...
when I could have had you shot.

608
01:05:20,561 --> 01:05:24,607
- You better clear out. And I mean fast!
- What about that speech you gave me?

609
01:05:24,732 --> 01:05:27,985
I didn't know you'd slap any white man!
Least of all Endicott!

610
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:31,030
All right. Give me another day.
Two days. I'm close.

611
01:05:31,155 --> 01:05:35,451
I can pull that fat cat down.
I can bring him right off this hill!

612
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:39,705
Oh, boy.

613
01:05:41,957 --> 01:05:44,501
Man, you're just like the rest of us.

614
01:05:45,711 --> 01:05:47,921
Ain't ya?

615
01:06:02,352 --> 01:06:05,063
Its all my fault.

616
01:06:09,234 --> 01:06:11,278
But there's no point in ducking it.

617
01:06:11,403 --> 01:06:14,114
Its gonna be tough
to keep you in your job now.

618
01:06:16,283 --> 01:06:20,620
Now look here, Bill. I don't have to tell you
how urgent it is to get Tibbs outta town.

619
01:06:20,745 --> 01:06:23,957
- No. I already told him to go.
- All right.

620
01:06:24,082 --> 01:06:27,169
Now, Miz Colbert
is not gonna be back till Thursday.

621
01:06:27,294 --> 01:06:29,379
You catch your guilty party by then,

622
01:06:29,504 --> 01:06:33,133
she won't hold it against us we had
to send Tibbs home for his own good.

623
01:06:33,258 --> 01:06:35,969
But you gotta do it, you hear?

624
01:06:36,094 --> 01:06:38,138
I hear.

625
01:06:39,681 --> 01:06:41,266
Bill?

626
01:06:44,728 --> 01:06:47,230
What's made you change
your mind about Tibbs?

627
01:06:47,355 --> 01:06:49,399
Who says I have?

628
01:06:50,191 --> 01:06:52,610
Last chief we had,

629
01:06:52,736 --> 01:06:58,074
he'd have shot Tibbs one second after he
slapped Endicott, claimed self-defence.

630
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:17,635
- Gillespie here.
- Courtney here, sir.

631
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,056
- Did you take Virgil down the depot?
- No, sir. He just plain wouldn't go.

632
01:07:22,181 --> 01:07:25,268
- Shagbag saw him headin' to River Road.
- Check.

633
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:34,277
(car horn)

634
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:40,283
(car horn)

635
01:07:43,244 --> 01:07:45,496
(car horn)

636
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:51,377
Hey! C'mon! C'mon!

637
01:08:01,887 --> 01:08:03,931
(car horn)

638
01:08:12,857 --> 01:08:14,900
(car horn)

639
01:08:18,654 --> 01:08:20,447
Hey! C'mon!

640
01:08:39,425 --> 01:08:41,468
(car horn)

641
01:10:17,188 --> 01:10:20,400
OK, black boy. We come here
to teach you some manners.

642
01:10:23,236 --> 01:10:27,532
We told you about them bad manners,
boy. You better put that down.

643
01:10:32,829 --> 01:10:35,456
(Virgil) Why don't you
come and get it, baby?

644
01:10:56,018 --> 01:11:00,064
(thug) C'mon, man. You ain't nothin'.
C'mon. Let's get him.

645
01:11:03,609 --> 01:11:05,653
We'll put that round your neck.

646
01:11:11,826 --> 01:11:14,036
Hit him, man! Get him from the side!

647
01:11:27,174 --> 01:11:29,301
Get behind him!

648
01:11:31,845 --> 01:11:34,223
All right, hold it!

649
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:41,814
All right, boys.

650
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:48,695
You've had your fun.
Now go on, you just run along home.

651
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:54,451
Nigger-lover.

652
01:12:04,795 --> 01:12:08,757
- I didn't catch what you said.
- Get rid of the nigger.

653
01:12:08,882 --> 01:12:12,135
You don't... we will.

654
01:12:14,346 --> 01:12:16,932
Now, is that a suggestion,
or is that an order?

655
01:12:17,057 --> 01:12:19,101
That's a warnin'!

656
01:12:22,187 --> 01:12:24,022
I see.

657
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:26,942
I see.

658
01:12:31,488 --> 01:12:35,492
Shut up and take this trash outta here!
Come on, move it and go!

659
01:12:44,376 --> 01:12:47,170
Well, you finally get the message, Virgil?!

660
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:03,228
May I get in?

661
01:13:03,353 --> 01:13:05,980
- Thought you left town.
- Not yet.

662
01:13:11,069 --> 01:13:14,989
Could you follow the same route you
followed Tuesday night, same speed?

663
01:13:15,114 --> 01:13:17,575
- Why?
- Why not?

664
01:13:21,454 --> 01:13:25,375
- Maybe I better check with the chief.
- I wouldn't want him to slap you down

665
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:28,127
for steppin' outta line,

666
01:13:28,252 --> 01:13:31,005
makin' decisions on your own,
and all that.

667
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,676
He don't knock me outta my socks.

668
01:13:38,346 --> 01:13:40,556
Let's get rollin', Virgil.

669
01:13:59,158 --> 01:14:01,827
All you little birds better lock up tight

670
01:14:01,953 --> 01:14:05,247
Cos there's a foul owl
on the prowl tonight

671
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:09,794
Hey, little lark, get outta the dark

672
01:14:09,919 --> 01:14:13,714
Foul owl on the prowl

673
01:14:13,839 --> 01:14:17,426
Cute little jay, stay outta his way

674
01:14:17,551 --> 01:14:20,429
Foul owl on the prowl

675
01:14:21,347 --> 01:14:25,184
You just might be the quail he'll tail

676
01:14:25,309 --> 01:14:28,854
Foul owl on the prowl

677
01:14:28,979 --> 01:14:32,733
You just might be
the swallow he'll follow

678
01:14:32,858 --> 01:14:35,736
Foul owl on the prowl

679
01:14:37,154 --> 01:14:40,115
lf you hear him hoot-scoot

680
01:14:41,033 --> 01:14:43,994
lf you pass his tree-flee

681
01:14:44,828 --> 01:14:47,790
lf you catch his eye-fly

682
01:14:48,624 --> 01:14:51,585
Don't wait to say goodbye

683
01:14:51,919 --> 01:14:55,923
Take ten minutes to get myself
a king-sized Coke and a wedge of pie.

684
01:14:56,965 --> 01:14:59,843
That is, if that peckerwood
ain't sold out again.

685
01:15:02,846 --> 01:15:06,808
- Can I bring you anything?
- No. I'm coming in.

686
01:15:18,028 --> 01:15:20,113
I thought I told you to get outta here.

687
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:23,116
- I'm not ready to leave.
- I was gonna tell you, Chief.

688
01:15:23,241 --> 01:15:26,161
- You forget about those four maniacs?
- I need more time.

689
01:15:26,286 --> 01:15:29,289
- Do I have to put you on the train myself?!
- I guess so!

690
01:15:29,414 --> 01:15:31,458
Whoa.

691
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:36,630
All right, Virgil.
Just what the hell do you want?

692
01:15:37,506 --> 01:15:41,927
I wanna know exactly where Sam was
at all times on the night of the murder.

693
01:15:42,302 --> 01:15:45,263
lf you pass his tree-flee

694
01:15:46,097 --> 01:15:49,184
lf you catch his eye-fly

695
01:15:49,726 --> 01:15:54,689
Virgil, if you get killed, we'll have one hell
of a mess in this town. You know that?

696
01:15:56,483 --> 01:15:58,526
I know.

697
01:16:17,962 --> 01:16:20,924
Got some real luscious cream pie
for you tonight, Sam.

698
01:16:21,049 --> 01:16:24,052
I mean Officer Wood.
Just like you always order.

699
01:16:24,177 --> 01:16:28,681
You know I don't eat that stuff. The chief
likes his boys streamlined. Right, Chief?

700
01:16:28,806 --> 01:16:31,267
Why don't you shut up, Sam?

701
01:16:32,477 --> 01:16:36,105
- All right, what'll you have, Virgil?
- I ain't servin' him!

702
01:16:44,739 --> 01:16:48,910
Tuesday night you walked
out of here at 2.40. Right?

703
01:16:49,035 --> 01:16:51,078
Right on the button.

704
01:16:52,038 --> 01:16:54,499
Two minutes from now.

705
01:17:09,764 --> 01:17:10,973
That's for him.

706
01:17:26,947 --> 01:17:30,034
Now, what'd you do
when you came out that night?

707
01:17:31,035 --> 01:17:33,496
Well, I picked up the radio and called in.

708
01:17:33,621 --> 01:17:35,289
Do it, please.

709
01:17:35,414 --> 01:17:37,875
Go ahead. Go ahead.

710
01:17:45,799 --> 01:17:50,429
Uh... Wood to radio.
I'm leavin' Compton's now.

711
01:17:50,554 --> 01:17:53,849
(Courtney) Sam, look sharp.
Gillespie's sniffin' around.

712
01:17:53,974 --> 01:17:56,018
Gimme that thing!

713
01:17:56,852 --> 01:18:00,773
Courtney, your brother says I didn't
tell him to fix that hinge, so I told you.

714
01:18:00,898 --> 01:18:02,816
Do you read me, Courtney?

715
01:18:02,941 --> 01:18:06,028
- Oh, I'll get right on it, Chief.
- I'd do that if I were you.

716
01:18:06,153 --> 01:18:08,197
Yes, sir. Ten-four.

717
01:18:27,716 --> 01:18:31,219
All right, you can move us. Officer Wood.

718
01:19:14,679 --> 01:19:17,515
- Why'd you do that, Sam?
- Do what?

719
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,518
Change your route
back there at the corner.

720
01:19:23,396 --> 01:19:25,857
Who says I changed?

721
01:19:28,651 --> 01:19:32,614
Look, I oughta know what I did!
Chief, do I have to put up with this?

722
01:19:32,739 --> 01:19:35,199
Do I work for you, or do I work for him?

723
01:19:39,162 --> 01:19:41,205
Good night, gentlemen.

724
01:20:10,359 --> 01:20:12,695
I don't know.

725
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:15,906
- I don't know.
- Well, I appreciate anything you can do.

726
01:20:17,575 --> 01:20:20,745
- This is highly irregular.
- Yeah, I know that.

727
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:26,042
Showing our depositors' accounts?
Hm. I don't know.

728
01:20:28,711 --> 01:20:32,673
- You sure this is an official request?
- Yes. Its official, yes.

729
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:39,805
- You willing to put that in writing?
- Yeah. I'll put it in writing.

730
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:42,224
On police department letterhead?

731
01:20:42,349 --> 01:20:45,769
I would write it on the head of a pin
if you want it there.

732
01:20:45,895 --> 01:20:50,024
- I gotta have somethin' for the file.
- I realise that, but I'm in a hurry.

733
01:20:50,149 --> 01:20:53,110
Well, we'll see.

734
01:20:54,987 --> 01:20:59,116
He's had an account with us
for several years now.

735
01:20:59,241 --> 01:21:01,076
That so?

736
01:21:02,161 --> 01:21:04,204
Not a large account.

737
01:21:05,581 --> 01:21:08,125
Never more than... Yeah.

738
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,174
$208.

739
01:21:15,299 --> 01:21:18,969
That was back in '62. September.

740
01:21:20,137 --> 01:21:24,474
I am not interested in '62 September.
I am interested in yesterday.

741
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:27,269
Yesterday? Well...

742
01:21:29,813 --> 01:21:32,190
Well.

743
01:21:32,316 --> 01:21:37,487
According to this,
he made a deposit of... $632.

744
01:21:37,612 --> 01:21:39,614
- Yesterday?
- Yes.

745
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:43,660
- Thank you.
- Must have been when I was out to lunch.

746
01:21:43,785 --> 01:21:46,455
A deposit that size, I'd remember.

747
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:50,167
Oh, you'll send me that letter
for the file, you hear?

748
01:21:50,292 --> 01:21:54,504
I'll tell you, baby brother, the chief
didn't like him, not even from the first.

749
01:21:54,629 --> 01:21:56,631
(door opens)

750
01:21:56,756 --> 01:21:59,259
- Morning.
- Where do you think you're goin'?

751
01:21:59,384 --> 01:22:01,845
(Courtney) Its all right. Let him go.

752
01:22:06,933 --> 01:22:11,396
I just talked to the FBI lab. We can
prove Colbert was in that greenhouse.

753
01:22:11,521 --> 01:22:13,732
Endicott's covering up.

754
01:22:13,857 --> 01:22:16,943
I'm afraid you're too late.
We already got the guilty man.

755
01:22:17,068 --> 01:22:19,612
- Who?
- Sam.

756
01:22:20,196 --> 01:22:22,449
- Sam?
- That's right.

757
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,788
Our man is Endicott.

758
01:22:29,122 --> 01:22:32,417
You just think a minute.
Didn't you catch Sam in a lie last night?

759
01:22:32,542 --> 01:22:35,879
And yesterday he makes
a big cash deposit at the bank.

760
01:22:36,004 --> 01:22:38,464
lf I told you once,
I told you a hundred times

761
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:42,176
that I won that matchin' quarters
and halves. It took me three years!

762
01:22:42,302 --> 01:22:44,387
Then why was it in big bills? I checked.

763
01:22:44,512 --> 01:22:48,516
Because whenever I got enough change,
I'd trade it in on $20 bills.

764
01:22:48,641 --> 01:22:51,728
And when I got up to $600,
I took it down and put it in the bank.

765
01:22:51,853 --> 01:22:56,899
The day Colbert was killed, he cashed
a cheque for $900, $600 of which is gone,

766
01:22:57,024 --> 01:23:01,404
$300 of which I believe you left in the
wallet as bait for some kid like Oberst!

767
01:23:01,529 --> 01:23:06,075
- What kinda man do you think I am?!
- Now, don't you push me, boy!

768
01:23:10,621 --> 01:23:12,999
Now listen.

769
01:23:13,124 --> 01:23:15,751
lf you weren't suspicious of Sam here,

770
01:23:15,876 --> 01:23:20,006
why did you question him last night
when he changed his route?

771
01:23:22,425 --> 01:23:25,219
- I knew why he changed his route.
- Knew what?

772
01:23:25,344 --> 01:23:29,265
He was afraid I'd see
some naked white girl down the block.

773
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:31,767
- What?
- Some girl named Delores Purdy.

774
01:23:31,892 --> 01:23:36,188
She parades around in the nude
at night to get her kicks. That's...

775
01:23:37,565 --> 01:23:39,316
- How do you know?
- I know.

776
01:23:39,442 --> 01:23:41,694
Well, I know. Do you understand?

777
01:23:41,819 --> 01:23:44,947
I know that Colbert
cashed a cheque for $900.

778
01:23:45,072 --> 01:23:47,700
I know that Sam made a big cash deposit.

779
01:23:47,825 --> 01:23:51,954
I know that you caught him in a lie.
And I know that's enough for me.

780
01:23:53,455 --> 01:23:55,541
C'mon, Sam.

781
01:23:55,666 --> 01:23:57,710
Martin, lock him up.

782
01:24:01,547 --> 01:24:03,382
Well?

783
01:24:06,927 --> 01:24:11,056
Well... you're making a mistake.

784
01:24:11,724 --> 01:24:14,184
Don't you bet against it.

785
01:24:16,812 --> 01:24:19,356
You can catch your train now, Virgil.

786
01:24:42,462 --> 01:24:44,297
Tibbs?

787
01:24:46,925 --> 01:24:49,511
Do you think Sam did it?

788
01:24:52,973 --> 01:24:55,892
- Where do I find the chief?
- What's it all about?

789
01:24:56,017 --> 01:24:57,644
My business.

790
01:24:59,688 --> 01:25:01,940
Hey, look, Purdy.

791
01:25:02,065 --> 01:25:06,069
Now, you got a complaint?
Well, right here's where you file it.

792
01:25:07,654 --> 01:25:10,198
What I got to say, I say to the chief.

793
01:25:11,283 --> 01:25:14,035
Its about Sam Wood.

794
01:25:14,869 --> 01:25:16,705
All right.

795
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,376
- (knock on door)
- (Gillespie) Yeah?

796
01:25:24,629 --> 01:25:27,882
(Harold) Purdy's out here, sir.
Its about Sam.

797
01:25:28,007 --> 01:25:30,468
All right. Send him in.

798
01:25:41,563 --> 01:25:44,107
She is gonna have a baby.
Sam Wood's baby.

799
01:25:50,947 --> 01:25:53,491
Well, ask her yourself
if you don't believe me!

800
01:25:54,075 --> 01:25:56,536
What are you doin' here?

801
01:25:57,912 --> 01:26:00,957
Its important that I hear this.

802
01:26:04,502 --> 01:26:07,505
I ain't talkin' about this
with him in the room.

803
01:26:10,967 --> 01:26:16,055
- Boy, you don't want trouble, you get!
- You be sensible. I'm a police officer.

804
01:26:18,933 --> 01:26:22,562
You gonna get him outta here,
or do I gotta do it?!

805
01:26:22,687 --> 01:26:26,732
You ain't gonna do nothin'.
You just stand there and shut up.

806
01:26:27,441 --> 01:26:29,276
(sniggers)

807
01:26:36,033 --> 01:26:38,077
Sit down, little girl.

808
01:26:41,872 --> 01:26:43,916
All right, now.

809
01:26:45,042 --> 01:26:49,755
You tell me... all about it.
Just tell me how it happened.

810
01:26:53,342 --> 01:26:55,469
Oh, come on. Come on, girl, speak!

811
01:26:55,594 --> 01:26:58,764
- Well, you know how hot it's been.
- Yeah.

812
01:26:58,889 --> 01:27:01,350
Nights, they aren't any better.

813
01:27:02,977 --> 01:27:05,437
My brother works nights.

814
01:27:06,188 --> 01:27:09,024
He leaves me all alone.

815
01:27:09,149 --> 01:27:12,152
This particular night,
I go out on the porch.

816
01:27:13,153 --> 01:27:17,074
I'm thinkin' how nice it'd be
if I had a fountain drink.

817
01:27:19,159 --> 01:27:21,620
Sam comes down our road.

818
01:27:22,496 --> 01:27:24,915
Just like he comes every night.

819
01:27:25,916 --> 01:27:30,295
Passin' like a lord
in that fine, big, shiny car.

820
01:27:33,382 --> 01:27:36,009
Only, this time he stops.

821
01:27:37,511 --> 01:27:41,181
He's got a nice face,
don't you think, Chief?

822
01:27:41,306 --> 01:27:43,141
So he stopped.

823
01:27:47,396 --> 01:27:50,399
- (softly) He says...
- What? I didn't hear what you said.

824
01:27:50,524 --> 01:27:52,567
(louder) He says...

825
01:27:53,985 --> 01:27:56,279
"Hey, little girl,

826
01:27:57,656 --> 01:28:00,534
you know what
the coolest spot in town is?"

827
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:06,206
And I said "No, Sam. I guess I don't."

828
01:28:07,165 --> 01:28:11,378
And he said...
"The cemetery. That's where."

829
01:28:12,754 --> 01:28:14,756
"Know why?"

830
01:28:16,549 --> 01:28:21,846
"Cos they got all of them
big, cool tombstones."

831
01:28:21,972 --> 01:28:25,892
"Ever stretch out
on a tombstone, Delores?"

832
01:28:26,017 --> 01:28:30,605
"Feel all that nice, cool marble
along your body?"

833
01:28:36,277 --> 01:28:39,614
- He said that?
- You hear, Chief? You hear?

834
01:28:39,739 --> 01:28:41,783
Yeah, I hear. I hear.

835
01:28:42,408 --> 01:28:47,580
All right. Sam comes along and stops in
front of your house and talks. What else?

836
01:28:48,039 --> 01:28:51,668
Well, come on now, girl.
What else? What else? What else?

837
01:28:52,877 --> 01:28:56,047
- Then I went for a ride with him.
- Where'd you go?

838
01:28:56,172 --> 01:28:57,256
The cemetery.

839
01:28:57,382 --> 01:29:01,511
So, Wood took you to
the cemetery in the patrol car, right?

840
01:29:01,636 --> 01:29:05,306
And then things went a bit too far.
Is that what you're sayin'?

841
01:29:05,431 --> 01:29:07,683
Did they get a little bit outta line?

842
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:10,686
Come on now.
Is that what you're tryin' to say?

843
01:29:10,812 --> 01:29:12,855
Come on, girl! Is it or ain't it?

844
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:15,650
- Yeah, they went too far!
- Well, fine!

845
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,237
Now, I got one more question.
Very important.

846
01:29:19,737 --> 01:29:22,198
Did he force you, or did you let him?

847
01:29:22,573 --> 01:29:25,993
Don't mean a damn whether
she let him or not! She is still 16!

848
01:29:26,118 --> 01:29:29,121
In this state, that's rape!
I know the plain law on that!

849
01:29:29,247 --> 01:29:33,167
I know the laws in the state
of Mississippi, thank you!

850
01:29:36,253 --> 01:29:39,215
- Are you sure you're pregnant?
- Yes, I am pregnant!

851
01:29:43,928 --> 01:29:45,638
- Courtney!
- Yes, sir?

852
01:29:45,763 --> 01:29:48,849
Better get in here with a pad and a pencil.

853
01:29:54,063 --> 01:29:56,732
Come on in. I want you
to take this all down.

854
01:29:56,857 --> 01:30:00,986
You had no right to keep a nigger
in the room, shame my little sister.

855
01:30:03,405 --> 01:30:05,532
You had no right.

856
01:30:07,493 --> 01:30:10,079
Virge, what's happenin'?

857
01:30:10,204 --> 01:30:11,538
- Hi, Harve.
- How are you?

858
01:30:11,664 --> 01:30:14,208
- Fine.
- Man, uh...

859
01:30:16,794 --> 01:30:21,507
- You sure saved my hide.
- Listen, Harvey. Man, uh...

860
01:30:23,801 --> 01:30:27,513
lf a guy knocks up a girl in this town,
where can he go for help?

861
01:30:30,933 --> 01:30:33,727
- Barbershop.
- Barbershop?

862
01:30:34,269 --> 01:30:37,773
Borrow Mr. Fanning's razor
and cut your throat!

863
01:30:38,607 --> 01:30:40,442
Well...

864
01:30:41,735 --> 01:30:44,613
But suppose
Mr. Fanning's razor is too dull.

865
01:30:44,738 --> 01:30:48,325
Suppose he's got some
real money to spread around.

866
01:30:52,329 --> 01:30:54,373
Uh...

867
01:30:54,498 --> 01:30:56,333
Well, uh...

868
01:30:57,626 --> 01:31:00,587
There used to be a coloured gal.

869
01:31:00,712 --> 01:31:06,426
But she kept bumpin' her price,
and I don't know if she's still in business.

870
01:31:06,551 --> 01:31:10,138
- What's her name?
- Well, I ain't never had to look her up.

871
01:31:11,598 --> 01:31:14,684
But, uh... Packy might know.

872
01:31:15,727 --> 01:31:18,188
Where do I find Packy?

873
01:31:18,897 --> 01:31:23,026
Down at the pool hall.
But, man, he wouldn't tell you.

874
01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:25,987
Not unless I say so.

875
01:31:26,112 --> 01:31:29,366
And how am I gonna say so
locked up in here?

876
01:31:29,699 --> 01:31:34,037
Suppose I get word to Packy that you
wanna see him? Have him come here?

877
01:31:37,332 --> 01:31:40,001
Will you let him
bring me a cheeseburger?

878
01:31:43,755 --> 01:31:45,840
Onions?

879
01:31:45,965 --> 01:31:48,176
Now you're talkin'!

880
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:51,221
(Sam) Uh... Virge?

881
01:32:42,146 --> 01:32:44,315
(footstep)

882
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:46,692
A little careless, ain't you, Virgil?

883
01:32:46,817 --> 01:32:51,781
Parked in the road, you could get yourself
killed. Anybody'd know where you are.

884
01:32:53,616 --> 01:32:57,995
- You know what this land is?
- Yeah. Its the site for the new factory.

885
01:32:59,079 --> 01:33:04,710
I found a piece of wood in Colbert's scalp.
The lab identified it as pine.

886
01:33:04,835 --> 01:33:09,381
Three people saw Colbert drive by -
alone-on the way back from Endicott's.

887
01:33:09,506 --> 01:33:14,219
Colbert must have picked up somebody
in town and then come out here.

888
01:33:14,345 --> 01:33:17,181
I tell you he didn't pick up nobody.

889
01:33:17,306 --> 01:33:21,310
Sam followed him here, come up behind
him, just like I come up behind you.

890
01:33:21,435 --> 01:33:25,105
- I heard you. Colbert would have too.
- He turned and he got smashed!

891
01:33:25,230 --> 01:33:27,357
He was hit from behind!

892
01:33:27,483 --> 01:33:30,819
lf Delores Purdy hadn't come in,
I never would have seen the truth.

893
01:33:30,944 --> 01:33:34,573
I was hung up trying to get Endicott,
for personal reasons.

894
01:33:35,073 --> 01:33:37,242
Do you know what I'm gonna do, Virgil?

895
01:33:37,367 --> 01:33:40,704
I'm gonna take you to Brownsville
and put you on the bus myself.

896
01:33:40,829 --> 01:33:44,541
You aren't taking me anywhere.
You dig? You're holding the wrong man!

897
01:33:44,666 --> 01:33:49,546
The wrong man?! I got the motive, which
is money, and the body, which is dead!

898
01:33:49,671 --> 01:33:52,049
- What makes you so sure?
- Why do you doubt it?!

899
01:33:52,174 --> 01:33:54,509
Because Colbert was killed here!

900
01:33:54,635 --> 01:33:57,888
Then driven back to town in his own car
and dumped on the streets.

901
01:33:58,013 --> 01:34:00,766
Sam couldn't have driven two cars!

902
01:34:30,545 --> 01:34:32,589
What do you want?

903
01:34:35,383 --> 01:34:37,594
Give me till morning.

904
01:35:15,048 --> 01:35:17,091
(Gillespie chuckles)

905
01:35:20,344 --> 01:35:22,638
You know...

906
01:35:22,764 --> 01:35:26,350
You know, Virgil,
you are among the chosen few.

907
01:35:29,020 --> 01:35:31,189
How's that?

908
01:35:31,314 --> 01:35:36,319
Well, I think that you're the first
human being that's ever been in here.

909
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:44,160
Well, you can't be too careful, man.

910
01:35:47,621 --> 01:35:50,166
You know a lotta things, don't you?

911
01:35:51,250 --> 01:35:54,336
Well, just what do you know
about insomnia?

912
01:35:59,717 --> 01:36:01,469
Bourbon can't cure it.

913
01:36:06,098 --> 01:36:08,559
Well... that's for sure.

914
01:36:09,894 --> 01:36:13,647
Now look. I got no wife. I got no kids.

915
01:36:14,607 --> 01:36:19,778
Boy, I got a town that... don't want me.

916
01:36:24,491 --> 01:36:28,078
And I got an air conditioner
that I have to oil myself,

917
01:36:28,954 --> 01:36:32,249
and a desk with a busted leg.
And on top of that, I got...

918
01:36:34,001 --> 01:36:35,836
this, uh...

919
01:36:37,004 --> 01:36:39,131
place.

920
01:36:39,256 --> 01:36:42,926
Now, don't you think that'd
drive a man to takin' a few drinks?

921
01:36:50,726 --> 01:36:53,604
I'll tell you a secret.

922
01:36:53,729 --> 01:36:55,772
Nobody comes here.

923
01:36:57,649 --> 01:36:59,484
Never.

924
01:37:09,911 --> 01:37:12,080
You married?

925
01:37:13,457 --> 01:37:15,292
No.

926
01:37:16,751 --> 01:37:18,795
Ever been?

927
01:37:21,006 --> 01:37:22,841
No.

928
01:37:26,928 --> 01:37:29,389
Ever been close to it?

929
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:44,946
Close to it.

930
01:37:49,617 --> 01:37:54,664
Don't you get just... a little lonely?

931
01:38:00,753 --> 01:38:03,548
No lonelier than you, man.

932
01:38:08,845 --> 01:38:12,098
Oh, now, don't get smart, black boy.

933
01:38:15,059 --> 01:38:17,603
I don't need it.

934
01:38:23,026 --> 01:38:25,403
No pity, thank you.

935
01:38:30,116 --> 01:38:32,160
No, thank you!

936
01:38:34,787 --> 01:38:36,205
(knock at door)

937
01:38:40,459 --> 01:38:41,627
- Yeah?
- Chief?

938
01:38:41,752 --> 01:38:45,715
- Yeah.
- You know where I can find Virgil?

939
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,758
Who are you?

940
01:38:47,883 --> 01:38:52,263
Packy, Chief. Packy Harrison.
I'm a friend of Harve.

941
01:38:55,391 --> 01:38:58,728
- You got something for me?
- Yeah.

942
01:38:58,853 --> 01:39:01,981
- Where you goin'?
- Where whitey ain't allowed.

943
01:39:02,815 --> 01:39:07,069
- What the hell does that mean?
- You gave me till morning. Remember?

944
01:39:15,327 --> 01:39:17,371
(car engine starts)

945
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:43,981
- Here's the car.
- He could have exchanged cars by now.

946
01:39:44,106 --> 01:39:47,109
John, you stick here. We'll keep cruisin'.

947
01:39:57,160 --> 01:40:00,122
You find him,
come back for me, you hear?

948
01:40:03,834 --> 01:40:07,379
That's her place, here.
You want me to wait?

949
01:40:08,213 --> 01:40:11,883
No, thank you, Packy. You go on home.

950
01:40:33,154 --> 01:40:35,198
(bell tinkles)

951
01:40:54,843 --> 01:40:56,803
Mrs. Bellamy?

952
01:40:57,512 --> 01:41:00,390
People around here
call me Mama Caleba.

953
01:41:00,765 --> 01:41:05,103
Mama, I'm not from around here.
But you can put me on my train.

954
01:41:05,687 --> 01:41:09,315
You talk crazy. You gin-drunk?

955
01:41:10,567 --> 01:41:13,152
Just homesick.

956
01:41:13,987 --> 01:41:15,989
Lord, Lord!

957
01:41:16,114 --> 01:41:19,659
Whisper two little words,
Mama, and I'm on my way.

958
01:41:19,784 --> 01:41:25,915
Maybe... I don't want to sever
a beautiful child like you right out.

959
01:41:33,172 --> 01:41:35,216
A man's name.

960
01:41:39,262 --> 01:41:41,305
First name, last name.

961
01:41:42,890 --> 01:41:45,977
The man who's paying you
for Delores Purdy's abortion.

962
01:41:46,102 --> 01:41:48,646
You're the boy who works for Mr. Charlie.

963
01:41:50,648 --> 01:41:53,109
I thought that's who you was.

964
01:41:54,277 --> 01:41:56,737
Why you wanna do that?

965
01:41:58,197 --> 01:42:01,367
Why you wanna help the police like that?

966
01:42:01,492 --> 01:42:04,370
They stealin' your soul.

967
01:42:04,495 --> 01:42:07,748
They chew you up and spit you out.

968
01:42:07,873 --> 01:42:10,418
I'm not here to lay a finger on you, Mama.

969
01:42:12,461 --> 01:42:14,672
Its the white boy I want.

970
01:42:14,797 --> 01:42:17,258
What you got against him?
He's paying for his fun.

971
01:42:17,383 --> 01:42:20,761
How much? I bet you he's not
paying you more than a hundred.

972
01:42:21,303 --> 01:42:25,516
You know how much he's got in
his pocket right now? More than $600!

973
01:42:26,475 --> 01:42:29,687
That cracker? (chuckles)

974
01:42:29,812 --> 01:42:33,941
- Where'd he come off getting 600?
- He killed Mr. Colbert.

975
01:42:37,152 --> 01:42:39,279
You gone crazy out of your mind.

976
01:42:39,405 --> 01:42:42,282
Now listen. Hear me good, Mama, please.

977
01:42:42,408 --> 01:42:44,827
Don't make me have to send you to jail.

978
01:42:45,994 --> 01:42:47,454
A lot you care!

979
01:42:47,579 --> 01:42:51,375
There's white time in jail, and
coloured time. The worst kind you can do

980
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,210
is coloured time.

981
01:42:56,672 --> 01:43:00,008
Child... you promise...

982
01:43:01,843 --> 01:43:04,555
give me understanding.

983
01:43:05,305 --> 01:43:07,766
I got used to better.

984
01:43:08,642 --> 01:43:11,353
You won't take it away?

985
01:43:13,897 --> 01:43:15,982
I won't take it away.

986
01:43:18,235 --> 01:43:22,155
Well... I don't know his name.

987
01:43:23,031 --> 01:43:26,409
But she's coming here tonight.

988
01:43:26,785 --> 01:43:28,829
Get herself straight.

989
01:43:44,886 --> 01:43:47,764
- Leave me alone! Let me go!
- (man) Let go of her!

990
01:43:49,099 --> 01:43:51,726
- Let go of her!
- Let go of me!

991
01:43:55,230 --> 01:43:57,690
Gonna teach you, boy!

992
01:43:58,274 --> 01:44:00,318
No club this time, man?

993
01:44:01,069 --> 01:44:05,323
A gun's not smart. The way
you killed Colbert was much smarter.

994
01:44:06,366 --> 01:44:08,493
You killed Colbert?!

995
01:44:08,618 --> 01:44:11,579
He's crazy. Crazy.

996
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,878
(horn blares)

997
01:44:34,102 --> 01:44:37,271
(thug) OK, nigger. Your time, nigger.

998
01:44:37,647 --> 01:44:39,690
Look in her purse.

999
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:44,028
- What's that mean?
- She's got $100 to pay for an abortion.

1000
01:44:44,153 --> 01:44:46,447
Listen to that. That's crazy.

1001
01:44:46,572 --> 01:44:49,325
Money she got from Ralph.

1002
01:44:49,742 --> 01:44:51,869
You gonna listen to him?

1003
01:44:51,994 --> 01:44:54,872
He got her to tell you
that Sam Wood did it.

1004
01:44:55,539 --> 01:44:58,167
He made a fool out of you, Purdy.

1005
01:44:59,877 --> 01:45:02,338
- Delores?
- Liar!

1006
01:45:02,964 --> 01:45:06,133
You stinkin' liar!

1007
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:08,344
(Purdy) Gimme that purse!

1008
01:45:21,816 --> 01:45:26,779
You turned my little sister...
into a field slut?

1009
01:45:29,448 --> 01:45:32,076
(Delores screams) Lloyd! Lloyd!

1010
01:45:32,201 --> 01:45:35,079
- Hey, man, stay back!
- He's got a gun!

1011
01:45:37,456 --> 01:45:39,500
He's dead.

1012
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:44,963
(Delores sobs)

1013
01:45:51,762 --> 01:45:54,264
When I left her house,
I was going to the diner.

1014
01:45:54,389 --> 01:45:57,476
Mr. Colbert drove by,
so I hitched a ride with him. That's all.

1015
01:45:57,601 --> 01:46:01,438
I said "I sure would like a job in
that new factory once you get started."

1016
01:46:01,563 --> 01:46:05,984
And he said "Sure." And I said
"Well, I wonder where it's gonna be."

1017
01:46:06,109 --> 01:46:10,906
He said that field we were comin' up to
was it, and he would stop and show me.

1018
01:46:11,573 --> 01:46:14,451
I said to myself "Man, he's askin' for it."

1019
01:46:15,077 --> 01:46:18,747
I said "Now, Ralph,
all you gotta do when we get out...

1020
01:46:19,915 --> 01:46:24,378
is just sneak up behind him
and just... tap him."

1021
01:46:25,504 --> 01:46:29,633
"And then just claim that somebody
jumped us from the bushes."

1022
01:46:34,805 --> 01:46:36,848
That's all.

1023
01:46:38,058 --> 01:46:40,519
I didn't mean to kill him.

1024
01:46:45,982 --> 01:46:47,859
Yeah.

1025
01:46:47,984 --> 01:46:50,528
All right, Courtney. That's enough.

1026
01:47:01,414 --> 01:47:04,042
All right. C'mon, Ralph.

1027
01:47:17,514 --> 01:47:19,682
(Ralph on tape) That's all.

1028
01:47:20,767 --> 01:47:23,228
I didn't mean to kill him.

1029
01:48:06,854 --> 01:48:09,398
Well, got your ticket?

1030
01:48:10,232 --> 01:48:12,276
Here you are.

1031
01:48:13,652 --> 01:48:15,696
Thank you.

1032
01:48:17,073 --> 01:48:19,116
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye.

1033
01:48:24,705 --> 01:48:26,749
Virgil?

1034
01:48:31,086 --> 01:48:34,173
You take care. You hear?

1035
01:48:39,053 --> 01:48:40,554
Yeah.
