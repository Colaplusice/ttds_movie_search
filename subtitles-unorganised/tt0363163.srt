1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,076
This way, quickly.

2
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,916
Loyalty and courage
still exist in this world.

3
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,839
Ritter von Greim
and Frulein Reitsch, how good...

4
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,117
...that the both of you arrived
more or less unharmed.

5
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,713
Sit down.

6
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,636
We came under heavy fire,
but still arrived in Gatow.

7
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,758
From there,
we couldn't continue.

8
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,630
We flew in a Fieseler Storch,
over the Russian lines...

9
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,997
...and landed on the
East-West axis, close to here.

10
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,312
Before landing, the Soviets
had a go at us.

11
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,637
A telegram from Gring.

12
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,273
Received yesterday.
Read

13
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,396
You see they spare me nothing.

14
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,476
Neither deception nor infidelity.
Neither infamy nor treason.

15
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,315
You end up regretting
your own kindness.

16
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,189
General Von Greim, I appoint you
Supreme Commander of the Luftwaffe.

17
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,636
I hereby promote you
to General-Field Marshal.

18
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,518
Mein Fhrer, I will not disappoint you.

19
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,470
A big responsibility
rests on your shoulders.

20
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,791
You must rebuild the
Luftwaffe from the ground up.

21
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,509
Many mistakes have been made.
Be ruthless.

22
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,437
Life doesn't forgive weakness.

23
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,951
This so-called humanity
is religious drivel.

24
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,273
Compassion is an eternal sin.
To feel compassion for the weak...

25
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,635
...is a betrayal of nature.

26
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,352
The strong can only triumph
if the weak are exterminated.

27
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,959
I've remained faithful to this law of nature,
and have never shown compassion.

28
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,393
I've always been ruthless
when faced with internal...

29
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,759
...opposition from other races.
And that's the only way.

30
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,872
Apes, for instance...

31
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,635
...kill all outsiders.

32
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,549
And what applies to apes,
most certainly applies to humans.

33
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,357
Himmler made an offer to surrender...

34
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,355
...to the Western powers.

35
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,954
Via Count Bernadotte.

36
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,957
Reported on English radio.

37
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,550
Himmler.
Of all people, Himmler.

38
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:58,671
The most loyal of my loyals.
That is the most terrible treason.

39
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,434
Gring, yes, he was corrupt.
Always has been.

40
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:12,869
Speer, yes, an absent-minded artist.
All the others: yes.

41
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,758
But Himmler?

42
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,517
Has he gone insane?

43
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,878
He must have told
them I'm sick.

44
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,156
Or perhaps already dead.

45
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,352
Leave me alone with Ritter Von Greim
and Frulein Reitsch.

46
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,591
And get Fegelein.
We don't know where he is.

47
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,799
What? He's Himmler's adjutant.
He must be available.

48
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,351
We haven't seen him for days.
I want a report immediately.

49
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,995
Stay, Doctor, Please.

50
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,951
You and Greim must go as quickly
as possible. Fly to Dnitz.

51
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,831
Tell him to do everything
it takes to punish Himmler.

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,549
We've decided to
die with you.

53
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,870
Thank you for this proof of loyalty.

54
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,272
But Himmler must die.
He committed treason.

55
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,912
He's no longer necessary
for my plans.

56
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,471
Do you think I'll just look on as
those Jewish swine slaughter me?

57
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,916
This is part of a huge decoy operation.
I've allowed the enemy...

58
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:44,074
...to invade the Reich.
And they think they've won.

59
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,791
But mark my words:
they'll have a rude awakening.

60
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,192
Dnitz is mobilizing in the north.
Kesselring in the south.

61
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,273
We'll surround the enemy
and crush them in a pincer movement.

62
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,958
From Prague, three armies will attack
the Russians, simultaneously, from the rear.

63
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,114
I didn't know we still had
so many reserve troops.

64
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,470
I made sure you'll soon have
a thousand of the most modern...

65
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,838
...jets at your disposal.

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,551
With those, you can make the
Luftwaffe ready for battle again.

67
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,555
I kneel to your genius, at the
altar of the Fatherland.

68
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,159
He'll be furious if he learns
that Hermann is gone.

69
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,758
Hopefully it's not what it seems.
The Fhrer would never forgive him.

70
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,238
It makes me feel sick.
My sister is carrying Hermann's child.

71
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,910
Don't be so glum, Frulein Braun.

72
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,154
You know the Fhrer as benevolent.
But he can also be quite the opposite.

73
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,031
Heil, mein Fhrer.

74
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,435
You too have requested to leave Berlin?

75
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,678
Mein Fhrer, as you know,
all medical departments...

76
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,515
...that fall under the SS and Himmler,
have left Berlin.

77
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,276
Himmler is a traitor.
He won't escape punishment.

78
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,389
Mein Fhrer, as Reichsarzt SS,
I have no more work here.

79
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,031
Your request to leave Berlin
is unacceptable.

80
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,314
My family...

81
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,078
If the Russians...

82
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,869
I must leave.
You've done nothing wrong.

83
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,910
Future generations will thank you
for your medical research.

84
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,674
I take all the responsibility.

85
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,230
We'll talk about it later.

86
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,552
Gruppenfhrer Fegelein cannot
be found. He's not in the bunker.

87
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,917
What, you can't find Fegelein?

88
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,915
Keep searching. I want to speak
with Fegelein. Immediately.

89
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,278
If he left just like that,
that's desertion. Treason.

90
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,396
Bring me Fegelein.

91
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,836
Fegelein. Fegelein.

92
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,669
Daddy, why are you wearing
your Sunday uniform?

93
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,990
Ernst, is something wrong?
No.

94
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,037
Thank you.

95
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,111
Brigitte is hungry too.

96
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,156
Ilse, you should eat something too.

97
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,072
Thank you.
You're welcome.

98
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,353
Thank you.

99
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,993
What is it?
Gruppenfhrer, you're under arrest.

100
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,435
What?
You're suspected of desertion.

101
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,511
Get dressed.
You'll come with us.

102
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,114
Like hell.

103
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,438
Search the room.

104
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,512
Let go of me.
You can't give me orders.

105
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,990
You won't have Hermann
executed, will you?

106
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,391
There's no doubt.
He wanted to flee.

107
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,348
What does it matter?
Everything's over.

108
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,512
Think of my poor sister.
She's pregnant by Hermann.

109
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,434
He collaborated with Himmler.
He's a traitor.

110
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,274
There's no compassion for traitors.

111
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,159
There's no mercy for them.

112
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,876
He'll be court-martialled
and executed.

113
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,836
What's the point of that?

114
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,357
It is my will.

115
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,032
You're the Fhrer.

116
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,479
Speak.

117
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,154
The Russians are advancing
more and more.

118
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,790
There are no more reserves.
Supplies from the air are impossible.

119
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,269
There's no ammunition
coming in anymore.

120
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,718
In the north, the Russians are standing
in front of the Weidendammer bridge.

121
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,871
In the East: Lustgarten.
South: Potsdammer Platz.

122
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,318
West: Tiergarten, about 400 meters
from the Chancellery.

123
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,359
How long can you hold out?
At most, two days.

124
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,273
Including the government district?
Yes sir, mein Fhrer.

125
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,240
As a soldier, I suggest we
flee Berlin. It's surrounded.

126
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:14,033
The battle of Berlin has killed
20,000 of our best officers.

127
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,236
That's what young people are for.

128
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,310
Your proposal is insane.
Complete madness.

129
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,677
Think of the thousands of wounded.
We can't help them.

130
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,470
Mein Fhrer, the orders have been written.
I give you my word...

131
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,760
The Fhrer cannot make an honorless
disappearance from world history.

132
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,072
Even if such a move was successful...

133
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,710
...I'll end up in another
troublesome situation.

134
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,113
I'd have to stay in the open air,
or on a farm...

135
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,271
...and wait for the end.

136
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,553
Wenck is advancing with the 12th Army.
He can join the 9th...

137
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,510
...and give the Russians
the final blow.

138
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,117
Wenck's an excellent fellow.
Send a telegram to Keitel:

139
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,951
Immediately report to me the following:

140
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,953
First:
Where is Wenck's vanguard located?

141
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,317
Second:
When will they attack again?

142
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,828
Third: Where is the 9th Army?
Fourth: where will they make a breakthrough?

143
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,075
You'll see, gentlemen.
I'll be right.

144
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,118
Wenck will come.

145
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,116
Wenck will come.

146
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,117
I want to know if Wenck
can do anything at all.

147
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,910
It's unlikely that Wenck's
small amount of troops...

148
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,995
What's unlikely about the offensive?
Wenck can't do anything anymore.

149
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,039
Then why don't you tell the Fhrer that?
Has everyone gone mad?

150
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,510
Do you think the Fhrer doesn't know?
He'll never surrender.

151
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,912
And neither will we. I've been
through that once. Never again.

152
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,150
Come on. I have to go.

153
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,118
Stop right there.

154
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,512
Heil Hitler.
155
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:21,918
You have to cut lengthwise.
In the mouth. One shot and you're dead.

156
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,875
Who will win?
Me.

157
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,469
You look very elegant.

158
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,599
I think we're all going to cry today.

159
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:45,596
Have we reached that point?
No, they'll be tears of joy.

160
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,950
What is it, Helga?

161
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,112
Helga, come.

162
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,558
Helga cries easily lately.
Excuse us.

163
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,792
I must go see your Uncle Hitler, children.
Good night.

164
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,714
Excuse me. I fell asleep.

165
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,678
Did you get some rest, my child?

166
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,954
In shorthand.

167
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,752
My political will.

168
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,675
More than 30 years have passed...

169
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,516
...since I made my contribution
as a volunteer...

170
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,389
...during the first World War.

171
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,793
During those 30 years,
I learned to think, act and live...

172
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,509
...out of love and loyalty
for my people.

173
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,319
Excuse me. The artillery...
Yes. Please sit down.

174
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,758
Centuries will pass...

175
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,311
...but from the ruins
of our cities and monuments...

176
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,554
...the hatred of the people...

177
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,678
...who did this to us,
will continue to flare up.

178
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,118
International Jewry
and its accomplices.

179
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,879
What is it, Herr Minister?

180
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,030
Imagine this.
The Fhrer wants me to leave Berlin.

181
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,589
He ordered it.

182
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,593
I've never ignored an order
from the Fhrer.

183
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,389
But I will ignore this order.
I'll stay with the Fhrer.

184
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,116
Please, Frau Junge...

185
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,995
...I want to dictate my will to you.

186
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,114
I'm typing
the Fhrer's will.

187
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,432
Good.

188
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,273
I understand.
Some other time.

189
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,117
Mein Fhrer, according to the racial law
I'm obliged to ask you:

190
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,431
Mein Fhrer, are you
of Aryan descent?

191
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,993
Can I see your identity card?

192
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,316
You're talking to the Fhrer here.
Alright then.

193
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,115
And you, Frulein Braun,
are you of Aryan descent?

194
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,068
Then there's nothing
to stop us.

195
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,119
I'm asking you now:
Do you, mein Fhrer, Adolf Hitler...

196
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,149
...take Eva Braun, present here,
as your wife? Answer "yes."

197
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,239
Do you, Eva Braun, take Fhrer
Adolf Hitler, present here...

198
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,437
...as your husband?
Answer "yes."

199
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,196
Then I declare you
man and wife.
200
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,319
Frau Junge.
Thank you. Krebs.

201
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,838
I'm happy you could be here.
Congratulations, but I didn't know about it.

202
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,313
When I had to sign, I almost
wrote Braun instead of Hitler.

203
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,755
I had to cross it out.

204
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,793
Is there a response from
our telegram to Keitel?

205
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,711
Do we have news of Wenck and his army?

206
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,393
No, mein Fhrer, I regret to report.

207
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,510
He's injured.

208
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,831
Everything will be alright.

209
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,597
You must go to the Fhrer right away.
At this hour?

210
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,199
How long can we hold out?
Twenty hours, no more.

211
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,477
The Russians are within
a few hundred meters.

212
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,598
For the moment we've brought
them to a standstill.

213
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,959
You know, Mohnke, the western
democracies are decadent.

214
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,319
They'll succumb to
the people from the east.

215
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,474
All the best. Thank you.

216
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,550
It wasn't only for Germany.

217
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,717
A message from Keitel.

218
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,395
1. Wenck's vanguard is
stuck south of Schwielowsee.

219
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,473
2. The 12th Army cannot
continue the attack on Berlin.

220
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,633
3. The 9th Army is
completely surrounded.

221
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:18,078
What do we do when the last
ammunition reserves have been exhausted?

222
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,832
I'll never surrender. Never.

223
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,072
I forbid you, and the other
commanders, to surrender.

224
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,551
Listen, Gnsche. My wife and I
are going to commit suicide.

225
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,350
I don't want my corpse
exposed by the Russians.

226
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,796
I don't want them to get me,
dead or alive.

227
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,192
I want to be burned
and never to be found.

228
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,832
Gnsche, I want you to promise me...

229
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,279
...that you will do
all it takes.

230
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,038
Mein Fhrer...

231
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,790
...that's a terrible order,
but I will carry it out.

232
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:46,116
Kempka.
Erich, I need 200 liters of gasoline.

233
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,511
Are you crazy?
Where will I get that from?

234
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,353
From the parked vehicles.

235
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,796
What's all that gas for?
I can't say over the telephone.

236
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,995
Come, please.
The Fhrer wants to see us.

237
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,437
Should I tell the Fhrer
you're indisposed?

238
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,309
It's only my collapsed lung.

239
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,074
I'll die soon anyway.

240
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,437
Excuse me.

241
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,920
Over here, Herr Professor.

242
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,510
One moment, please.

243
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,078
Excuse me.

244
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,159
I'm sorry to interrupt
your important work.

245
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,950
Mein Fhrer, keep faith
in the final victory.

246
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,830
Lead us
and we shall follow.

247
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,478
Come on.

248
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,789
Join the crowd.

249
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,349
Come. Have a drink.

250
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,234
Anyway there isn't much else we can do.
Do sit down.

251
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:11,112
That's better.
Yes sir, the situation is pretty shitty.

252
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,674
Can we sit down?
Please do, Frulein Br...

253
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,072
Frau...
You can call me Frau Hitler.

254
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,638
It's alright.

255
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,514
A pity we can't go outside anymore.

256
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,877
Only if you want
to die a heroic death.

257
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,990
Fritz, control yourself a bit.
Yes. Control.

258
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,478
Take cover.

259
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,231
Let's go.

260
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,315
What are you doing here?
I have to report to the Fhrer.

261
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,914
You can't right now.
Sit down.

262
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,719
Sit. Drink.

263
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,078
May I present Frau Hitler?

264
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,279
So young and so many decorations.
You must be proud.

265
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,517
Excuse me.
I'm not used to drinking anymore.

266
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,797
You can use our toilet.

267
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,199
If your hand shakes, the bullet
might only hit the optic nerve.

268
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:49,434
That's why it's good
to take the poison too.

269
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,390
When you bite through the capsule,
pull the trigger.

270
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,994
Will I have enough time?

271
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,470
The poison starts working
after one or two seconds.

272
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,115
Tornow, you too.

273
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,278
Come Blondi.

274
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,796
You know, Frau Junge,
I've known...

275
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,952
my husband for
more than 15 years.

276
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:11,035
But when I think about it,
I know nothing about him.

277
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,270
Even though he likes to talk.

278
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,590
I longed for Berlin,
but he's so different now.

279
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,673
He only talks about dogs
and vegetarian food now.

280
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,718
I hate Blondi.

281
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,957
Sometimes I kick her, and the Adolf
wonders why she's acting funny.

282
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,676
He doesn't want anyone to see into his heart.

283
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,910
I mean...

284
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,995
...he can be so caring
in his private life.

285
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,035
And then he says
those cruel things.

286
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,237
When he's the Fhrer, you mean?

287
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,556
Come, let's smoke another one.

288
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,912
I'm sorry.

289
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,871
You have so many worries
and here I am, whining.

290
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,599
Frau Junge, I'm giving you this coat
as a farewell gift.

291
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,754
I like fashionable ladies.
I want you to enjoy it.

292
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,672
What a surprise. Thank you.

293
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,313
I just don't know where and when
I can wear it.

294
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,429
Please, try to get out of here.

295
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,158
Promise me.

296
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:33,194
Thank you. That was very good,
Frulein Manziarly.

297
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,631
The time has come. It's finished.

298
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,793
The Fhrer wants to say goodbye.
Come with me.

299
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,111
You're the bravest mother
of the Reich.

300
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,990
Mein Fhrer, you've made me
the happiest woman in Germany.

301
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,154
Say hello to my beautiful Bavaria.

302
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,628
Children, what are you doing here?

303
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,394
We want to see Aunt Eva
and Uncle Hitler.

304
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,439
Have you eaten anything yet?
Only breakfast.

305
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,719
Stay here, I'll get something to eat.
I'll be right back.

306
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:30,030
Comrades, this is the
latest news from the outside.

307
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:35,274
Berlin is full of warehouses: There were
houses here, there were houses there.

308
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,958
Herr Gnsche,
I want to speak to the Fhrer.

309
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,997
Please, I have to.

310
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,913
Frau Goebbels, the Fhrer
doesn't want to be disturbed.

311
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,390
Please, Gnsche,
just for a moment.

312
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,993
Please.

313
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,072
Mein Fhrer, Frau Goebbels is here.

314
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,073
What is it?

315
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,798
Mein Fhrer, I beg you.
Leave Berlin.

316
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:22,195
Mein Fhrer, don't leave us.
What will become of us?

317
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:32,151
Tomorrow, I'll be cursed by millions,
but fate wanted it this way.

318
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,351
Get up. Come on.

319
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,318
Come.

320
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,630
Aunt Traudl, I like it
when it thunders.

321
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,631
Yes? Why?

322
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,112
Nothing can happen to us down here, can it?
No.

323
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,313
Direct hit!

324
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,636
Reichsleiter, it's over.

325
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,434
The Fhrer is dead.

326
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,436
There's daddy.

327
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,279
Are you crazy?
For that damned gasoline of yours...

328
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,431
Erich, shut up.

329
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,152
Stand back.

330
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,751
Come on, keep going.

331
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,353
Go on.

332
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,034
No, don't.

333
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,919
Let grandpa go.

334
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,677
Order. Order.
We must have order.

335
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,116
Order must be restored.

336
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,911
This way. We know the way.
You can trust us.

337
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,638
Hurry.

338
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,638
I was on the side of
the Red Beasts.

339
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,589
I supported the Bolsheviks.

340
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,236
Let's hope the Russians
got our message.

341
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,472
We'll soon find out.
Or not.

342
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,552
Nicely done.

343
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,590
Perfect.

344
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,719
Very good.

345
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,509
Comrade General,
the German delegation is here.

346
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,558
Already?
They're out front.

347
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,399
Ask them to wait a moment.

348
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,237
Come on, comrades.

349
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:08,279
Put these medals on.
My generals are still at the front.

350
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:13,798
You'll replace my general staff.
Act as if you're a general.

351
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,599
Everything must look official.

352
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,472
Let's go, comrade.

353
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,673
Don't say a word. Keep still.

354
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,958
Enter.

355
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,713
We know each other.

356
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,513
From the Kremlin, before the war.
I was an attach at the German embassy.

357
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,070
What news do you have, General?

358
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:59,076
This morning, Adolf Hitler and his
wife committed suicide in the bunker.

359
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,636
We're aware.

360
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,274
Surprising.

361
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,199
The new government
has authorized me...

362
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,235
...to open peace talks...

363
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:29,396
...between our countries, that both
suffered severe losses.

364
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:34,759
General, if you were me,
would you make peace with you?

365
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:40,119
That is my mission.
Notify your government of this:

366
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,759
Berlin must surrender unconditionally.

367
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:49,391
All those who capitulate
must lay down their arms.

368
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,790
Then we can talk.

369
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:59,753
My government will never accept
unconditional surrender.

370
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,871
Given the situation,
you have no other choice.

371
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,112
Surrender? Never.
That's shameful.

372
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,999
Years ago, I conquered
Berlin from the Reds...

373
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,676
...and I'll defend this city
to my last breath.

374
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,752
In the short time I have
as Chancellor...

375
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,391
...I'll never sign
a surrender treaty.

376
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,870
It's for the sake of the people.
The Fhrer's orders are final.

377
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,999
This is crazy.
We have to start negotiations.

378
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,630
I repeat, gentlemen:
I do not surrender.

379
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,997
Send a message to Marshal Zhukov.
Zhukov?

380
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,072
What's happening?
We're surrendering.

381
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,630
Then I must kill you.
The Fhrer forbids any surrender.

382
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,875
How long does it last?
About four hours.

383
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,228
Children, Doctor Stumpfegger has
the medication I told you about.

384
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,392
It's a bit bitter,
but it helps.

385
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,317
A sip for everybody.

386
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,272
Who wants to go first?

387
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,276
Heide, you're always so brave...

388
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,797
Have another sip.

389
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,517
See? That wasn't so bad.

390
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,875
Well done.
Helmut.

391
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:30,195
This medicine will make sure you don't
get sick in this damp bunker.

392
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,477
But it's not damp
in the bunker.

393
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,718
Well done.

394
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,118
Helga.

395
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,398
I don't want to.

396
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:59,032
What's that? Do you want to get sick?
Please, mommy. I don't want to drink it.

397
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,791
Don't cry, baby.
That doesn't help.

398
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,030
You have to drink the medicine.

399
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,833
Helga.

400
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,391
Come on, open your mouth.

401
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,355
Goodnight, children.

402
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,196
One day the lie will collapse...

403
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,750
...and there will be light
in the darkness.

404
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,956
Please read that.

405
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,828
One day the lie will collapse and
there will be light in the darkness.

406
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,073
Let's do it differently.
One day the lie will collapse...

407
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,836
...and truth will triumph once again.

408
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,039
At that moment, we will
stand above everyone...

409
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,794
...pure and...

410
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,958
...immaculate.

411
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:42,914
On April 30 1945, the Fhrer
committed suicide...

412
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:48,875
...and in doing so, deserted
everyone who was loyal to him.

413
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:54,068
You, soldiers of Germany, were loyal to
the Fhrer and were prepared...

414
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,596
...to continue the battle for Berlin,

415
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,513
...despite that ammunition
was in short supply...

416
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:05,993
...and further resistance
was pointless.

417
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:11,029
I hereby declare an
immediate cease-fire.

418
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,873
Each hour you continue fighting...

419
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:18,113
...prolongs the suffering
of the people of Berlin,

420
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,874
...and of our wounded.

421
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,272
In accordance with the supreme
command of the Soviet troops...

422
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,878
...I order you to stop
fighting immediately.

423
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:38,037
Weidling, former commandant
of the Berlin garrison.

424
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,472
A glass of water, please.

425
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,359
Dad, the Fhrer committed suicide.

426
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,988
We don't stand a chance.
So what? I want to get away.

427
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:29,392
How will we get through the lines?
It doesn't matter. I'm leaving.

428
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:33,075
We'll die.
Gerda, it won't be that bad.

429
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:36,835
If we stay, the Russians
will get us for sure.

430
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,632
All the best.

431
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,677
Come on, let's go.

432
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:55,592
Johannes, aren't you going?
I have to stay with the generators.

433
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,709
If they break down, the hospital
will have no electricity or fresh air.

434
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,190
Say hello to the Russians.
I will.

435
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,113
I don't need you anymore.

436
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,439
The game's over.

437
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,515
Doctor, the time is upon us.
Don't you see what's going on here?

438
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,275
I insist that you help us,
as a doctor.

439
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,396
Well then...

440
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:00,516
Go. You've done a lot.
Thank you.

441
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:12,756
Schdle, come with us.
I'm not going anywhere anymore.

442
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,356
Come on.

443
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,677
Listen up.

444
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,597
Tomorrow the General will hand
the city over to the Russians.

445
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,196
For soldiers, that means
becoming a prisoner of war.

446
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:39,435
I must give the Fhrer's will to the
new president, Grand Admiral Dnitz.

447
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,876
Those who wish to join me are welcome.

448
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:48,797
Tomorrow morning we must get through
the Russian lines. Questions?

449
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,999
I will lead the first of ten groups.
The women will come with me.

450
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:58,871
The other groups will leave
every 20 to 30 minutes. Good luck.

451
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,672
Are you alright?

452
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,398
Come on.

453
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,632
Stop. Turn out the light.

454
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:02,675
If those are Russians...
Then we'd be dead already. Flashlight.

455
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:11,874
We thought "Here comes Ivan."
See any Russians over there?

456
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:15,191
No, and you?
They haven't been here yet.

457
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,715
We've got to keep going.

458
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:13,115
Sturmmann Krger and his group
defended the Wolf Bridge...

459
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,874
...and he receives the Iron Cross,
second class.

460
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:20,875
Sturmmann Wagner took out two
machine-gun nests...

461
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:24,350
...and therefore, receives
the Iron Cross, second class.

462
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:27,990
Sturmmann Rauch has gotten
messages through the lines...

463
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:31,197
...and receives the Iron Cross,
second class.

464
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,550
The coast is clear.

465
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,831
Frulein Manziarly, we must go on.

466
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,993
I'm sorry, but I can't.
Come on.

467
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,037
Come on, let's go.

468
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,714
Get up, Gerda. We must go on.

469
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,551
The others are coming.

470
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,916
Oh my god.

471
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,832
Take cover, Mller.

472
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,914
Why don't you come with us?

473
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:25,232
No, we're not leaving here.

474
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,676
Good luck.

475
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,716
Halt. Who's there?

476
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,476
A German.

477
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,476
Herr Hewel?

478
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,634
Thank God, you're alive.

479
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,510
Where are the others?

480
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,791
I don't know, Frau Junge.
Somewhere. Maybe.

481
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,555
Most people from my group
must be dead.

482
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,757
I should have never
left that bunker.

483
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:32,596
I should have shot myself,
but I couldn't.

484
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:38,072
Eat something first.
There's always time to die.

485
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,317
Where is Adolf Hitler?

486
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,429
Adolf Hitler is dead. He shot himself
and his body was burned.

487
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,559
Where is Hitler's wife?
Dead, as well. Poison.

488
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:16,957
Where are their clothes?
I'll show you. Not there.

489
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,431
Come.

490
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,631
You stay with the women.

491
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,438
Come along.

492
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:47,998
I'm tired. I can't go on.

493
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:54,068
Find a way, Gerda.
We've already come this far.

494
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,800
I can't do it anymore.

495
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,398
Go see where the Russians are.

496
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:09,108
They've surrounded us.
What's going to happen to us?

497
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:14,638
Maybe you can get through.
Try. It's better than waiting here.

498
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,270
And you?
What will you and your soldiers do?

499
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,391
For us the trip stops here.

500
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,232
I'm not taking another step.

501
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:27,756
Think about it.
The Russians are upon us.

502
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:32,550
As women, you might have a chance.
Try it.

503
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,398
Good luck.

504
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:42,277
When you walk past the Russians,
don't look them in the eyes.

505
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:46,069
Remember that. All the best.

506
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,150
Herr Doctor.

507
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:58,075
My comrades want to surrender.
May I join you?

508
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:02,074
The Fhrer is dead. Do you want
to continue the war on your own?

509
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,516
I'm bound by my oath.

510
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:09,389
Then you'd best talk to
the Brigade Fhrer.

511
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,830
Enter here.

512
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,513
The Russians.

513
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:52,190
Gerda, let's go.
You go. I can't go on.

514
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,476
Please, Gerda.

515
01:11:55,880 --> 01:12:00,351
I have to give it a try.
Don't be angry with me.

516
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,110
I'll be alright.

517
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,230
The Russians are evacuating the square.
So?

518
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,709
There's no opposition.
No shooting.

519
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,394
Then they'll be here within the hour.

520
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,395
What shall we do?

521
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:52,997
We can't surrender.
Just what does that mean?

522
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:56,869
When the Russians come,
we'll empty our weapons on them.

523
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,874
The last bullets are for ourselves.
That's rubbish.

524
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:05,795
Is this prestigious murder and suicide
our only option?

525
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:09,953
We're SS officers.
We can't outlive the Fhrer.

526
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,634
Who agrees?

527
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:10,834
Germany will need
young people like you.

528
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,231
You must have a girl
who's waiting for you.

529
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,477
After all this
she won't be waiting.

530
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,551
Do you have a photo?

531
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:36,235
She's pretty.

532
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,395
What will your family say
if you don't return?

533
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,949
They'll be proud of me.

534
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:53,155
An enlargement of this one is
hanging above the fireplace in my house.

535
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:59,518
I don't want to insist, but...
My decision is made.

536
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:04,151
Tell my bride hello,
if you survive your captivity.

537
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:28,233
Come and sit down with me?
Gladly.

538
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:38,917
Why do you want to continue living?
And you? Why do you want to die?

539
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,269
Do you see this?

540
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,079
The Fhrer gave it
to me personally.

541
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:49,634
A final decoration?
Maybe.

542
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:54,430
He gave it to me at his farewell.
I had to promise him something.

543
01:16:54,600 --> 01:17:00,630
If the Russians catch me,
I have to kill myself.

544
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:05,555
Hitler made you promise that?
But why?

545
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:11,317
Maybe he didn't want me to be
forced to say anything about him.

546
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:16,031
But you're a diplomat.
You're under international protection.

547
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:19,909
Who benefits
if you comply with your promise?

548
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,832
There they are.

549
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,231
Don't shoot, comrades.

550
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:44,355
We surrendered.
The war is over.

551
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:47,356
It's over.

552
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:20,636
Unconditional surrender
occurred on May 7, 1945.

553
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:25,550
Hostilities were suspended
at midnight on May 8.

554
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,073
The war took the lives of
over 50 million people.

555
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:37,030
6 million Jews were killed
in German concentration camps.

556
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:43,036

and avoid imprisonment.

557

558

Dr. Schenck was released in 1953
by the Soviets.

559
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:54,955
He died in Aachen
on December 21, 1998.

560
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:58,954
Wilhelm Mohnke was released
by the Soviets in 1955.

561
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:03,238
He died in Damp, near Eckernfrde,
on August 6, 2001.

562
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:09,748
Helmut Weidling died in
captivity in 1955.

563
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:14,789
Werner Haase was arrested
in the bunker by the Red Army.

564
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:18,748
He died in captivity,
in 1945.

565
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:22,674
Otto Gnsche was arrested
by the Soviets.

566
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:26,992
He was released in 1956 and
died in Lohmar, in 2003.

567
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:32,075
Hanna Reitsch survived the war
and would break many flying records.

She died on August 28, 1979.

569

arrested by the Soviets.

Constanze Manziarly disappeared without
a trace during her flight from Berlin.

574
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,876
Albert Speer was arrested
in Flensburg, in 1945.

575
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,998
At Nuremberg he was
sentenced to 20 years.

576
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:06,232
He was released in 1966 and
died in London, in 1981.

577
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:12,999
Keitel and Jodl were sentenced to
death in Nuremberg and executed.

578
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,198
Hermann Gring was
sentenced to death.

579
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:19,875
He committed suicide in his cell
shortly before his execution.

580
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:24,830
Heinrich Himmler tried to escape
using a false name.

581
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,549
After he was unmasked,
he committed suicide.

582
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:34,192
Martin Bormann and Ludwig Stumpfegger
committed suicide on May 2, 1945...

583
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:37,238
...near the Lehrter Bahnhof.

584
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:41,871
Rochus Misch was released
by the Soviets in 1955.

585
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,429
He still lives in Berlin.

586
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:47,672
Traudl Junge was classified
as a "young follower."

587
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:51,037
She worked as a secretary and lived
in Munich, until her death in 2002.

588
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:56,433
Of course all the horror I heard
about during the Nuremberg trials...

589
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:01,549
...the 6 million Jews
and dissidents...

590
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:04,280
...and people of other races...

591
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:09,150
...who died, shocked me deeply.

592
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:14,758
But I still didn't make the
connection with my own past.

593
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:19,994
I reassured myself by thinking
I wasn't personally guilty of it.

594
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:25,359
And that I hadn't known
about the sheer size of it.

595
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:31,789
But one day, I walked
past a commemorative plaque...

596
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:36,238
...for Sophie Scholl,
here on Franz-Joseph Street.

597
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,597
I saw that she was my age...

598
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:45,517
...and that she was executed in
the same year I joined Hitler.

599
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:50,913
And only then did I realize...

600
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:54,470
that youth is no excuse.

601
01:22:54,640 --> 01:23:00,670
And that it might have been
possible to have found out the truth.
