00:00:35.45,00:00:37.04
Pick a color.

00:00:37.88,00:00:41.38
- Blue.[br]- B-L-U-E. Pick a number.

00:00:43.09,00:00:46.06
- Eight.[br]- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:00:46.29,00:00:48.76
Pick one more number.

00:00:49.23,00:00:51.25
- Fifteen.[br]- 1, 2, 3, 4...

00:00:51.46,00:00:55.53
...5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,[br]13, 14, 15.

00:00:55.74,00:00:57.70
Pick another number.

00:00:58.07,00:01:00.47
- Six.[br]- Okay.

00:01:04.41,00:01:07.44
"Dream is destiny. "

00:02:50.72,00:02:52.51
Rock out.

00:02:53.15,00:02:55.02
Rock 'n' roll.

00:02:57.92,00:03:00.65
Low strings. Begin!

00:03:32.56,00:03:35.58
Sara, try that thing you asked[br]me about.

00:03:35.80,00:03:39.75
Will you try it more subdued?

00:03:39.97,00:03:42.56
- Try it, see what you think.[br]- That one?

00:03:42.77,00:03:47.10
But I want it to sound rich[br]and almost a little wavy...

00:03:47.31,00:03:49.67
...due to being a bit out of tune.

00:03:49.91,00:03:52.21
- You want it...[br]- Slightly detached.

00:03:52.41,00:03:54.44
That's what I was wondering.

00:03:54.95,00:03:55.94
We're going:

00:03:58.45,00:04:00.42
- Yeah. You got it.[br]- Okay.

00:04:00.65,00:04:02.85
Snazzy, people!

00:04:03.09,00:04:06.08
Okay, pickup to 20, please.

00:04:06.33,00:04:08.32
This is the pickup to 20.

00:04:08.53,00:04:10.15
One, two, three.

00:05:08.02,00:05:10.96
Hey, it's me.[br]I just got back into town.

00:05:11.16,00:05:14.25
I thought I'd bum a ride,[br]but that's cool.

00:05:14.46,00:05:18.12
I can just take a cab,[br]something like that.

00:05:20.77,00:05:24.36
I guess I'll hang out with you later[br]or something.

00:05:35.48,00:05:39.14
Ahoy there, matey![br]You in for the long haul?

00:05:39.62,00:05:42.59
Do you need a lift on down the line?

00:05:44.36,00:05:47.12
I was waiting for a cab, but...

00:05:47.33,00:05:50.35
All right. Don't miss the boat.

00:05:52.00,00:05:54.36
- Hey, thanks.[br]- Not a problem.

00:05:54.57,00:05:57.04
Anchors aweigh!

00:06:01.14,00:06:03.20
What do you think of my vessel?

00:06:03.41,00:06:07.14
She's "see-worthy. " S-E-E.[br]See with your eyes.

00:06:07.45,00:06:11.71
My transport should be an extension[br]of my personality. Voil!

00:06:11.95,00:06:16.82
And this is my window to the world.[br]Every minute's a different show.

00:06:17.02,00:06:20.15
I may not understand it[br]or agree with it...

00:06:20.36,00:06:24.02
...but I accept it[br]and just sort of glide along.

00:06:24.23,00:06:26.79
Keep things on an even keel, I say.

00:06:27.00,00:06:30.49
Go with the flow.[br]The sea refuses no river.

00:06:30.70,00:06:35.83
The idea is to remain in a state[br]of departure, while always arriving.

00:06:36.04,00:06:38.81
It saves on introductions[br]and goodbyes.

00:06:39.01,00:06:42.24
The ride requires no explanation,[br]just occupants.

00:06:42.45,00:06:44.38
That's where you come in.

00:06:44.65,00:06:48.75
It's like you come onto this planet[br]with a crayon box.

00:06:48.99,00:06:52.82
You may get the eight-pack[br]or the 16-pack...

00:06:53.03,00:06:58.09
...but it's all in what you do with[br]the crayons, the colors you're given.

00:06:58.33,00:07:01.39
Don't worry about coloring[br]within the lines.

00:07:01.60,00:07:05.80
Color outside the lines[br]and off the page! Don't box me in!

00:07:06.01,00:07:10.53
We're in motion to the ocean.[br]We are not landlocked!

00:07:10.74,00:07:12.90
So where do you want out?

00:07:13.25,00:07:17.71
Who, me? Am I first? I don't know.[br]Really, anywhere is fine.

00:07:18.22,00:07:21.78
Just give me an address[br]or something, okay?

00:07:22.19,00:07:25.09
Tell you what.[br]Go up three more streets.

00:07:25.29,00:07:30.52
Take a right. Go two more blocks.[br]Drop him off on the next corner.

00:07:32.43,00:07:33.69
Where's that?

00:07:34.27,00:07:36.60
I don't know, but it's somewhere.

00:07:36.80,00:07:41.10
And it'll determine the course[br]of the rest of your life.

00:07:41.87,00:07:44.43
All ashore that's going ashore!

00:09:13.77,00:09:17.90
I refuse to take existentialism[br]as just another fashion...

00:09:18.10,00:09:20.09
...or historical curiosity...

00:09:20.31,00:09:25.17
...because it has something important[br]to offer for the new century.

00:09:25.58,00:09:30.07
I'm afraid we're losing the real[br]virtues of living life passionately...

00:09:30.25,00:09:33.31
...taking responsibility[br]for who you are...

00:09:33.55,00:09:37.51
...making something of yourself[br]and feeling good about life.

00:09:37.92,00:09:42.36
Existentialism is often discussed[br]as a philosophy of despair...

00:09:42.56,00:09:44.83
...but I think it's the opposite.

00:09:45.03,00:09:49.90
Sartre once said he never really[br]felt a day of despair in his life.

00:09:50.47,00:09:53.20
One thing that comes[br]from these guys...

00:09:53.41,00:09:56.84
...is not a sense of anguish[br]so much as...

00:09:57.01,00:09:59.53
...an exuberance of feeling[br]on top of it.

00:09:59.75,00:10:03.41
It's like your life[br]is yours to create.

00:10:03.68,00:10:08.18
I've read the postmodernists with[br]interest, even admiration.

00:10:09.09,00:10:12.92
But I always have this awful,[br]nagging feeling...

00:10:13.13,00:10:15.89
...that something essential[br]is left out.

00:10:16.23,00:10:19.53
The more you talk about a person...

00:10:19.73,00:10:24.10
...as a social construction[br]or a confluence of forces...

00:10:24.30,00:10:27.43
...or as fragmented or marginalized...

00:10:27.64,00:10:31.30
...then you open up[br]a whole new world of excuses.

00:10:31.64,00:10:36.05
When Sartre talks about[br]responsibility, it's not abstract.

00:10:36.25,00:10:40.51
It's not the kind of self or soul[br]that theologians argue about.

00:10:40.75,00:10:44.05
It's something concrete.[br]It's us talking...

00:10:44.26,00:10:47.95
...making decisions[br]and taking the consequences.

00:10:48.43,00:10:51.86
There are six billion[br]people in the world.

00:10:52.23,00:10:55.33
Nevertheless, what you do[br]makes a difference.

00:10:55.53,00:11:00.27
It makes a difference[br]in material terms and to other people.

00:11:00.47,00:11:02.41
It sets an example.

00:11:02.61,00:11:06.48
The message is, we should[br]never write ourselves off...

00:11:06.68,00:11:10.64
...and see ourselves as victims[br]of various forces.

00:11:10.88,00:11:14.28
It's always our decision who we are.

00:11:23.80,00:11:26.56
Creation comes out of imperfection.

00:11:26.77,00:11:32.20
It seems to come out of a striving[br]and a frustration.

00:11:32.40,00:11:35.46
This is where, I think,[br]language came from.

00:11:35.67,00:11:41.04
I mean, it came from our desire[br]to transcend our isolation...

00:11:41.25,00:11:45.05
...and have some connection[br]with one another.

00:11:45.28,00:11:49.22
It had to be easy when[br]it was just simple survival.

00:11:49.42,00:11:52.45
"Water. " We came up[br]with a sound for that.

00:11:52.69,00:11:55.75
"Tiger behind you!"[br]We made a sound for that.

00:11:56.09,00:11:59.86
But when it gets really[br]interesting, I think...

00:12:00.07,00:12:04.87
...is when we use[br]that same system of symbols...

00:12:05.07,00:12:10.47
...to communicate all the abstract and[br]intangible things we're experiencing.

00:12:10.68,00:12:15.64
What is "frustration"?[br]Or what is "anger" or "love"?

00:12:15.85,00:12:18.32
When I say "love"...

00:12:18.55,00:12:22.95
...the sound comes out of my mouth[br]and hits the other person's ear...

00:12:23.16,00:12:27.59
...travels through this byzantine[br]conduit in their brain...

00:12:27.83,00:12:31.79
...through their memories of love[br]or lack of love.

00:12:32.00,00:12:37.94
They say they understand, but how[br]do I know? Because words are inert.

00:12:38.14,00:12:41.47
They're just symbols. They're dead.[br]You know?

00:12:41.67,00:12:46.17
And so much of our experience[br]is intangible.

00:12:46.38,00:12:51.37
So much of what we perceive cannot[br]be expressed. It's unspeakable.

00:12:51.82,00:12:56.25
And yet, you know, when we[br]communicate with one another...

00:12:58.66,00:13:02.99
...and we feel we have connected[br]and think we're understood...

00:13:03.20,00:13:07.93
...I think we have a feeling[br]of almost spiritual communion.

00:13:08.13,00:13:12.19
That feeling may be transient,[br]but it's what we live for.

00:13:23.48,00:13:27.58
To look at human development,[br]look at the organism's evolution...

00:13:27.79,00:13:30.58
...and his environmental interaction.

00:13:30.79,00:13:35.95
Evolution of the organism begins[br]with evolution through the hominid...

00:13:36.16,00:13:40.33
...coming to the evolution of man.[br]Neanderthal, Cro-Magnon.

00:13:40.53,00:13:44.33
Now, what you're looking at here[br]are three strings:

00:13:44.54,00:13:48.34
Biological, anthropological,[br]development of cultures...

00:13:48.54,00:13:52.10
...and cultural,[br]which is human expression.

00:13:52.31,00:13:56.91
What you've seen is the evolution[br]of populations, not individuals.

00:13:57.12,00:13:59.85
Then look at the time scale involved.

00:14:00.09,00:14:04.78
Two billion years for life,[br]six million for the hominid...

00:14:04.99,00:14:08.15
...100,000 years for mankind[br]as we know it.

00:14:08.36,00:14:11.42
You see how the evolutionary[br]paradigm telescopes.

00:14:11.60,00:14:17.54
Then when you get to agriculture,[br]scientific and industrial revolution...

00:14:17.74,00:14:21.43
...you're looking at 10,000 years,[br]400 years, 150 years.

00:14:21.64,00:14:25.10
You see a further telescoping[br]of evolutionary time.

00:14:25.31,00:14:27.97
As we go through the new evolution...

00:14:28.18,00:14:34.18
...it will telescope to the point[br]where we see it within our lifetime.

00:14:34.42,00:14:38.62
The new evolution stems[br]from two types of information:

00:14:38.79,00:14:42.23
Digital and analog.[br]Digital is artificial intelligence.

00:14:42.43,00:14:45.89
Analog results from molecular biology[br]and cloning.

00:14:46.10,00:14:48.57
You knit the two with neurobiology.

00:14:48.77,00:14:53.47
Under the old paradigm, one would[br]die, the other would dominate.

00:14:53.67,00:14:57.70
Under the new paradigm, they exist[br]as a supportive...

00:14:57.91,00:15:02.01
...non-competitive grouping,[br]independent from the external.

00:15:02.21,00:15:06.45
So evolution now becomes an[br]individually centered process...

00:15:06.89,00:15:09.68
...emanating from the individual...

00:15:09.89,00:15:15.16
...not a passive process with the[br]individual at the collective's whim.

00:15:15.36,00:15:18.06
So you produce a neo-human...

00:15:18.26,00:15:21.46
...with a new individuality,[br]a new consciousness.

00:15:21.67,00:15:24.79
That's only the beginning[br]of the cycle.

00:15:24.97,00:15:28.74
As it proceeds,[br]the input is this new intelligence.

00:15:28.94,00:15:32.88
As intelligence piles on intelligence,[br]ability on ability...

00:15:33.08,00:15:36.24
...the speed changes until you reach[br]a crescendo.

00:15:36.45,00:15:42.51
Imagine it as an instant fulfillment[br]of human and neo-human potential.

00:15:42.75,00:15:46.32
It could be the amplification[br]of the individual...

00:15:46.56,00:15:50.36
...the multiplication of individual,[br]parallel existences...

00:15:50.56,00:15:54.83
...with the individual no longer[br]restricted by time and space.

00:15:55.03,00:15:59.06
And the manifestations of this[br]neo-human evolution...

00:15:59.27,00:16:02.40
...could be dramatically[br]counterintuitive.

00:16:02.61,00:16:07.04
The old evolution is cold,[br]it's sterile. It's efficient.

00:16:07.25,00:16:10.27
Its manifestations are[br]those of social adaption.

00:16:10.48,00:16:15.15
You're talking about parasitism,[br]dominance, morality...

00:16:15.39,00:16:16.95
...war, predation.

00:16:17.19,00:16:21.56
These will be subject to de-emphasis[br]and de-evolution.

00:16:21.76,00:16:25.32
The new paradigm would give us[br]the traits...

00:16:25.53,00:16:29.56
...of truth, loyalty,[br]justice and freedom.

00:16:29.77,00:16:35.23
These would be manifestations of[br]this evolution. That's what we hope.

00:18:25.02,00:18:30.35
Self-destructive man feels completely[br]alienated. Utterly alone.

00:18:30.56,00:18:33.02
He's an outsider to the community.

00:18:33.26,00:18:36.52
He thinks to himself,[br]"I must be insane. "

00:18:36.73,00:18:40.82
What he fails to realize[br]is that society has, as he does...

00:18:41.03,00:18:45.09
...an interest in considerable[br]losses, in catastrophes.

00:18:45.30,00:18:49.54
Wars, famines, floods and quakes[br]meet well-defined needs.

00:18:54.11,00:18:58.07
Man wants chaos.[br]In fact, he's gotta have it.

00:18:58.28,00:19:02.72
Depression, strife, riots, murder.[br]All this dread.

00:19:02.95,00:19:08.65
We're drawn to that almost orgiastic[br]state created out of destruction.

00:19:08.86,00:19:12.09
It's in all of us. We revel in it.

00:19:14.13,00:19:19.37
The media puts a sad face on things,[br]painting them as human tragedies.

00:19:19.57,00:19:24.80
But the media's function is not[br]to eliminate the evils of the world.

00:19:25.01,00:19:30.00
They persuade us to accept those evils[br]and get used to living with them.

00:19:30.22,00:19:33.95
The powers that be[br]want us to be passive observers.

00:19:34.72,00:19:36.78
Have you got a match?

00:19:38.52,00:19:42.79
They haven't given us any other[br]options, outside the occasional...

00:19:42.96,00:19:47.06
...purely symbolic,[br]participatory act of "voting. "

00:19:47.27,00:19:52.03
Do you want the puppet on the right[br]or the puppet on the left?

00:19:52.24,00:19:56.73
The time has come to project my[br]inadequacies and dissatisfactions...

00:19:56.94,00:20:00.90
...into the sociopolitical[br]and scientific schemes.

00:20:01.11,00:20:04.67
Let my own lack of a voice be heard.

00:21:09.41,00:21:11.97
I keep thinking about[br]something you said.

00:21:12.22,00:21:14.41
- Something I said?[br]- Yeah.

00:21:14.89,00:21:17.86
About feeling like you[br]observe your life...

00:21:18.09,00:21:23.03
...from the perspective of[br]an old woman about to die. Remember?

00:21:23.26,00:21:25.82
I still feel that way sometimes.

00:21:26.03,00:21:28.43
Like I'm looking back on my life.

00:21:28.63,00:21:31.23
Like my waking life is her memories.

00:21:31.44,00:21:33.43
Exactly.

00:21:34.37,00:21:38.17
I heard that Tim Leary said[br]as he was dying...

00:21:38.38,00:21:42.87
...he looked forward to when his[br]body was dead but his brain was alive.

00:21:43.05,00:21:48.51
Those six to 12 minutes of brain[br]activity after everything shuts down.

00:21:48.72,00:21:54.59
And a second of dream consciousness is[br]infinitely longer than a waking one.

00:21:54.79,00:21:56.35
- Know what I mean?[br]- Yeah.

00:21:56.76,00:22:00.25
Like, I wake up at 10:12.[br]Then I go back to sleep...

00:22:00.47,00:22:06.13
...and have long, intricate dreams that[br]seem hours long. Then I wake up and...

00:22:06.30,00:22:07.29
...it's 10:13.

00:22:07.51,00:22:12.70
Exactly. So in that six to 12 minutes[br]of brain activity...

00:22:12.91,00:22:14.74
...that could be your life.

00:22:14.95,00:22:19.41
You are that woman,[br]looking back over everything.

00:22:19.62,00:22:22.45
If I am? What would you be in that?

00:22:22.65,00:22:24.12
Whatever I am now.

00:22:24.32,00:22:27.69
I mean, maybe I only exist[br]in your mind.

00:22:27.89,00:22:31.52
I'm still just as real[br]as anything else.

00:22:34.67,00:22:38.36
I've been thinking about[br]something you said.

00:22:38.57,00:22:43.56
About reincarnation, and where[br]all the new souls come from over time.

00:22:44.01,00:22:45.50
Everybody always...

00:22:45.71,00:22:51.24
...says they're the reincarnation[br]of Cleopatra or Alexander the Great.

00:22:51.42,00:22:54.54
You know they were a dumb fuck[br]like everyone else.

00:22:54.79,00:22:56.75
I mean, it's impossible.

00:22:56.96,00:23:01.45
The world population has doubled[br]in the past 40 years.

00:23:01.66,00:23:06.56
So if you believe in that ego thing[br]of one eternal soul...

00:23:06.90,00:23:10.53
...you have a 50% chance of your soul[br]being over 40.

00:23:10.74,00:23:16.30
For it to be over 150 years old,[br]it's only one out of six.

00:23:16.51,00:23:21.64
Are you saying reincarnation doesn't[br]exist? Or we're all young souls?

00:23:21.85,00:23:25.54
Half of us are first-round humans?[br]What are you...?

00:23:25.78,00:23:28.25
- What I'm saying...[br]- What's your point?

00:23:28.49,00:23:32.95
I believe reincarnation[br]is a poetic expression...

00:23:33.19,00:23:35.52
...of what collective memory is.

00:23:35.73,00:23:39.86
I read an article by a biochemist[br]not long ago.

00:23:40.06,00:23:43.47
He said when a member of a species[br]is born...

00:23:43.67,00:23:47.43
...it has a billion years[br]of memory to draw on.

00:23:47.77,00:23:51.26
This is where we inherit[br]our instincts.

00:23:51.51,00:23:53.84
I like that. Like there's...

00:23:54.05,00:23:58.00
...this telepathic thing going on[br]that we're a part of...

00:23:58.22,00:24:02.81
...whether we're conscious of it[br]or not. That would explain these...

00:24:03.05,00:24:08.65
...seemingly spontaneous, worldwide,[br]innovative leaps in science and art.

00:24:08.86,00:24:14.09
Like the same results popping up[br]everywhere, independent of each other.

00:24:14.30,00:24:18.26
A guy on a computer figures something[br]out and simultaneously...

00:24:18.44,00:24:21.77
...a bunch of people[br]figure out the same thing.

00:24:21.97,00:24:26.07
They did this study.[br]They isolated a group over time...

00:24:26.28,00:24:30.48
...and they monitored their abilities[br]at crossword puzzles...

00:24:30.65,00:24:33.17
...in relation[br]to the general population.

00:24:33.42,00:24:39.36
Then they secretly gave them a day-old[br]crossword. One already done by people.

00:24:39.56,00:24:42.49
Their scores went up dramatically.[br]Like 20%.

00:24:42.69,00:24:48.06
It's like once the answers are out[br]there, people can pick up on them.

00:24:48.27,00:24:52.50
It's like we're all telepathically[br]sharing our experiences.

00:25:14.99,00:25:18.39
I'll get you fuckers[br]if it's the last thing I do.

00:25:18.60,00:25:21.90
You're gonna pay[br]for what you did to me.

00:25:22.50,00:25:27.20
For every second I spend[br]in this hellhole...

00:25:27.41,00:25:31.27
...I'll see you spend a year[br]in living hell!

00:25:32.94,00:25:37.18
You fucks will beg me to let you die.[br]But no, not yet.

00:25:37.38,00:25:39.87
I want you cocksuckers to suffer.

00:25:40.35,00:25:44.88
I'll fix your asses.[br]Maybe a long needle in your eardrum.

00:25:46.29,00:25:48.38
Or a hot cigar in your eye.

00:25:48.73,00:25:50.19
Nothing fancy.

00:25:51.26,00:25:54.39
Some molten lead up the ass?

00:25:56.37,00:26:01.20
Or, better still,[br]some of that old Apache shit.

00:26:01.41,00:26:04.17
Cut your eyelids off.

00:26:05.68,00:26:08.74
I'll just listen to you fucks[br]screaming.

00:26:09.58,00:26:11.51
What sweet music that'll be.

00:26:12.45,00:26:14.48
We'll do it in the hospital...

00:26:14.72,00:26:19.16
...with doctors and nurses,[br]so you pricks don't die too quick.

00:26:19.36,00:26:21.33
You know the best part?

00:26:21.53,00:26:25.83
The best part is you faggots[br]will have your eyelids cut off...

00:26:26.03,00:26:30.36
...so you'll have to watch me[br]do it to you.

00:26:31.67,00:26:37.80
You'll see me bring that cigar closer[br]and closer to your wide-open eye...

00:26:39.04,00:26:44.28
...till you're almost[br]out of your mind. But not quite.

00:26:44.48,00:26:49.75
I want it to last a long, long time.

00:26:50.86,00:26:56.23
I want you to know it's me.[br]I'm the one doing it to you. Me!

00:26:56.89,00:27:02.20
That sissy psychiatrist,[br]what unmitigated ignorance!

00:27:02.40,00:27:06.89
And that old drunken fart of a judge.[br]What a pompous ass!

00:27:07.11,00:27:10.40
Judge not, lest ye be judged!

00:27:10.61,00:27:16.01
All of you pukes are gonna die[br]the day I get out of this shithole!

00:27:20.08,00:27:25.39
I guarantee you'll regret[br]the day you met me!

00:27:25.82,00:27:30.26
In today's world-view, science[br]has taken the place of God...

00:27:30.43,00:27:34.06
...but some philosophical[br]problems are still troubling.

00:27:34.23,00:27:35.79
Take free will.

00:27:35.97,00:27:39.96
This problem has been around[br]since Aristotle, in 350 B.C.

00:27:40.14,00:27:44.67
St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas[br]worried how we can be free...

00:27:44.84,00:27:47.40
...if God already knows[br]what we're gonna do.

00:27:47.81,00:27:52.51
Nowadays, we know the world works[br]by fundamental physical laws.

00:27:52.72,00:27:57.38
These laws govern the behavior[br]of every object in the world.

00:27:57.59,00:28:03.15
Since these laws are trustworthy, they[br]enable technological achievements.

00:28:03.33,00:28:08.56
We're physical systems too. Complex[br]arrangements of carbon, mostly water.

00:28:08.73,00:28:11.90
Our behavior isn't an[br]exception to these laws.

00:28:12.07,00:28:17.06
So whether it's God setting things up[br]in advance and knowing everything...

00:28:17.24,00:28:21.84
...or physical laws governing us,[br]there's not much room for freedom.

00:28:22.01,00:28:25.81
You might want to ignore[br]the mystery of free will.

00:28:26.02,00:28:29.65
To say, "It's a historical[br]anecdote, it's sophomoric.

00:28:29.85,00:28:33.19
It's a question with no answer.[br]Forget about it. "

00:28:33.36,00:28:38.52
But the question remains. If you think[br]about individuality, who you are...

00:28:38.70,00:28:43.60
...is based on the free choices[br]you make. Or take responsibility.

00:28:43.77,00:28:47.57
You're only held responsible[br]or admired or respected...

00:28:47.74,00:28:50.54
...for things you do[br]of your own free will.

00:28:50.71,00:28:54.24
The question keeps coming[br]and we have no solution.

00:28:54.41,00:28:56.61
Decisions can seem like charades.

00:28:56.78,00:29:00.95
Imagine it. There's electrical[br]activity in the brain. Neurons fire...

00:29:01.15,00:29:06.65
...sending a signal through the nerves[br]into the muscle fibers. They twitch.

00:29:06.86,00:29:10.66
You reach out your arm.[br]It looks like a free action...

00:29:10.83,00:29:13.89
...but every part of that process...

00:29:14.10,00:29:19.00
...is governed by physical laws.[br]Chemical, electrical, and so on.

00:29:19.17,00:29:22.63
It looks like the big bang[br]set the initial conditions...

00:29:22.81,00:29:25.83
...and the whole[br]rest of human history...

00:29:26.04,00:29:31.00
...is the reaction of subatomic[br]particles to basic physical laws.

00:29:31.18,00:29:34.64
We think we're special,[br]we have dignity.

00:29:34.85,00:29:38.79
That now is threatened.[br]It's challenged by this picture.

00:29:38.96,00:29:43.98
You might say, "What about quantum[br]mechanics? I know enough...

00:29:44.16,00:29:46.93
...to know it's a[br]probabilistic theory.

00:29:47.10,00:29:51.23
It's loose, not deterministic.[br]It lets us understand free will. "

00:29:51.40,00:29:54.57
But if you look at details[br]it won't really help...

00:29:54.74,00:29:59.37
...because you have quantum particles,[br]and their behavior is random.

00:29:59.54,00:30:03.10
They sort of swerve.[br]Their behavior is absurd...

00:30:03.28,00:30:08.28
...and unpredictable. We can't[br]study it based on what came before.

00:30:08.49,00:30:10.42
It has a probabilistic framework.

00:30:10.59,00:30:14.05
Is freedom just[br]a matter of probabilities?

00:30:14.29,00:30:16.49
Randomness in a chaotic system?

00:30:16.66,00:30:21.39
I'd rather be a gear in[br]a deterministic, physical machine...

00:30:21.57,00:30:23.62
...than some random swerving.

00:30:23.83,00:30:29.77
We can't ignore the problem. We must[br]find room in our world-view for persons.

00:30:29.94,00:30:34.10
Not just bodies, but persons.[br]There's the freedom problem...

00:30:34.28,00:30:39.94
...find room for choice and responsibility[br]and understanding individuality.

00:30:40.15,00:30:42.38
"You can't fight city hall. "

00:30:42.59,00:30:46.58
"Death and taxes. " "Don't talk about[br]politics or religion. "

00:30:46.79,00:30:50.73
This is all the equivalent[br]of enemy propaganda.

00:30:50.93,00:30:53.12
Lay down, G.I.![br]Lay down, G.I.!

00:30:53.30,00:30:58.50
We saw it in the 20th century. Now, in[br]the 21 st century, we must realize...

00:30:58.67,00:31:01.66
...that we cannot be crammed[br]into this rat maze.

00:31:01.84,00:31:04.27
We should not submit[br]to dehumanization!

00:31:04.44,00:31:07.71
I'm concerned with what's[br]happening in this world.

00:31:07.88,00:31:11.78
I'm concerned with structure,[br]the systems of control.

00:31:12.25,00:31:16.62
Those who control my life and those[br]who seek to control it more!

00:31:16.79,00:31:20.15
I want freedom![br]And that's what you should want!

00:31:20.46,00:31:25.42
It's up to each of us to turn loose[br]the greed, hatred, envy...

00:31:25.60,00:31:31.00
...and insecurities, their mode of[br]control. We feel pathetic, small...

00:31:31.17,00:31:36.07
...so we'll willingly give up our[br]sovereignty, liberty and destiny.

00:31:36.24,00:31:40.18
We must realize we're being[br]conditioned on a mass scale.

00:31:40.34,00:31:42.94
Challenge the corporate slave state!

00:31:43.15,00:31:47.95
The 21 st century is a new century.[br]Not the century of slavery...

00:31:48.15,00:31:50.48
...lies and issues of[br]no significance...

00:31:50.65,00:31:54.59
...and classism, statism[br]and other modes of control.

00:31:54.76,00:31:59.56
It'll be an age of humankind standing[br]up for something pure and right.

00:31:59.86,00:32:04.43
What a bunch of garbage. Liberal[br]Democrat, conservative Republican.

00:32:04.60,00:32:06.73
Two sides of the same coin!

00:32:06.94,00:32:09.17
Two management teams...

00:32:09.37,00:32:12.67
...bidding for the CEO job[br]of Slavery, Inc.!

00:32:12.84,00:32:16.97
The truth is out there,[br]but they lay out a buffet of lies!

00:32:17.18,00:32:20.55
I'm sick of it! And I'm not[br]gonna take a bite out of it!

00:32:20.79,00:32:24.12
Resistance is not futile![br]We will win this!

00:32:24.39,00:32:27.36
Humankind is too good![br]We're not underachievers!

00:32:27.56,00:32:33.52
We'll stand up and be human beings![br]We'll get fired up about real things!

00:32:33.70,00:32:38.29
Creativity and the dynamic human[br]spirit that refuses to submit!

00:32:38.74,00:32:42.76
Well, that's all I got to say.[br]It's in your court.

00:32:45.21,00:32:48.77
The quest is to be liberated[br]from the negative...

00:32:48.95,00:32:53.21
...which is really our[br]own will to nothingness.

00:32:53.42,00:32:58.35
Once having said yes to the instant,[br]the affirmation is contagious.

00:32:58.52,00:33:03.39
It bursts into a chain of affirmations[br]that knows no limit.

00:33:03.56,00:33:07.29
To say yes to one instant...

00:33:07.47,00:33:11.09
...is to say yes to all of existence.

00:33:11.80,00:33:15.00
The main character is[br]what I call "the mind. "

00:33:15.21,00:33:18.47
Its mastery, its capacity[br]to represent.

00:33:18.74,00:33:21.18
In history, attempts have been made...

00:33:21.38,00:33:26.28
...to contain experiences which[br]happen at the edge of the limit...

00:33:26.52,00:33:29.49
...where the mind is vulnerable.

00:33:29.89,00:33:34.15
But I think we are in a very[br]significant moment in history.

00:33:34.56,00:33:39.02
Those moments, those what we[br]might call liminal, limit, frontier...

00:33:39.26,00:33:42.49
...X- zone experiences are[br]now becoming the norm.

00:33:42.70,00:33:47.07
These multiplicities and distinctions[br]send differences, giving...

00:33:47.24,00:33:51.37
...great difficulty to the old mind.

00:33:51.71,00:33:54.80
And through entering into their[br]very essence...

00:33:55.01,00:33:57.78
...tasting and feeling their[br]uniqueness...

00:33:58.05,00:34:01.02
...one makes a breakthrough[br]to that common...

00:34:01.22,00:34:04.71
...something that holds[br]them together.

00:34:05.09,00:34:10.32
And so the main character[br]is to this new mind...

00:34:11.00,00:34:13.33
...greater, greater mind.

00:34:13.50,00:34:15.83
A mind that yet is to be.

00:34:16.20,00:34:19.57
And when we enter into that mode...

00:34:19.77,00:34:23.04
...you can see a radical subjectivity.

00:34:23.24,00:34:27.44
Radical attunement to individuality,[br]uniqueness, to the mind.

00:34:27.61,00:34:29.88
It opens itself to a vast objectivity.

00:34:30.08,00:34:32.74
So the story is of the cosmos now.

00:34:33.22,00:34:37.88
The moment is not just[br]a passing empty, nothing, yet...

00:34:38.09,00:34:42.18
...this is the way in which[br]these secret passages happen.

00:34:42.39,00:34:45.89
Yes, it's empty with such fullness...

00:34:47.16,00:34:50.86
...that the great moment,[br]the great life...

00:34:51.07,00:34:54.27
...of the universe is pulsating in it.

00:34:55.07,00:34:58.94
And each one, each object,[br]each place...

00:34:59.11,00:35:02.31
...each act, leaves mark.

00:35:02.81,00:35:08.38
And that story is singular.[br]But, in fact, it's story after story.

00:35:14.02,00:35:17.62
It dissolves into quick-moving[br]particles that swirl.

00:35:17.80,00:35:22.10
Either I'm moving fast, or time is.[br]Never both simultaneously.

00:35:22.27,00:35:24.89
It's such a strange paradox.

00:35:25.07,00:35:29.01
I'm closer to the end of my life[br]than I've ever been...

00:35:29.17,00:35:32.80
...but I feel more than ever that[br]I have all the time in the world.

00:35:32.98,00:35:35.64
When I was younger,[br]there was a need for...

00:35:35.85,00:35:39.04
...certainty. I had to get to[br]the end of the path.

00:35:39.25,00:35:43.85
I know what you mean.[br]I remember thinking:

00:35:44.05,00:35:47.79
Someday, in my mid-30s maybe...

00:35:47.96,00:35:51.99
...everything's going to somehow[br]gel and settle. Just end.

00:35:52.16,00:35:54.53
It was like there was a plateau...

00:35:54.73,00:35:58.73
...waiting for me. I was climbing up.[br]When I got to the top...

00:35:58.84,00:36:03.24
...all growth and change would stop.[br]Even exhilaration.

00:36:03.41,00:36:06.21
But it hasn't happened,[br]thank goodness.

00:36:06.38,00:36:10.44
In our youth, we don't take into[br]account our curiosity.

00:36:10.61,00:36:13.17
That's what's great about being human.

00:36:13.38,00:36:16.65
You know what Benedict Anderson[br]says about identity?

00:36:16.85,00:36:19.76
He talks about, say, a baby picture.

00:36:19.92,00:36:23.98
You pick up this two-dimensional image[br]and say, "That's me. "

00:36:24.16,00:36:28.93
To connect this baby in this weird[br]image with yourself in the present...

00:36:29.13,00:36:31.07
...you have to make up a story.

00:36:31.24,00:36:35.23
"This is me when I was a year old.[br]Later, I had long hair...

00:36:35.44,00:36:38.77
...and then we moved to Riverdale,[br]and here I am. "

00:36:38.94,00:36:42.40
So it takes a story[br]that's actually a fiction...

00:36:42.58,00:36:45.41
...to make you and the baby identical.

00:36:45.58,00:36:48.57
- To create your identity.[br]- The funny thing is...

00:36:48.79,00:36:52.38
...our cells completely[br]regenerate every seven years.

00:36:52.62,00:36:55.39
We've been several different people.

00:36:55.73,00:36:59.82
And yet, we always remain[br]quintessentially ourselves.

00:37:19.92,00:37:24.51
Our critique began as all critiques[br]begin, with doubt.

00:37:24.89,00:37:26.86
Doubt became our narrative.

00:37:27.09,00:37:30.49
Ours was a quest for[br]a new story, our own.

00:37:30.66,00:37:33.96
We grasped for this new history,[br]driven by suspicion...

00:37:34.13,00:37:36.93
...that ordinary language[br]couldn't tell it.

00:37:37.13,00:37:42.07
Our past appeared frozen in the[br]distance, and our every gesture...

00:37:42.24,00:37:46.57
...signified negation of the old[br]world and the reach for a new one.

00:37:46.74,00:37:51.20
How we lived created a new situation[br]of exuberance and friendship.

00:37:51.42,00:37:55.75
A subversive micro-society in[br]the heart of an ignoring society.

00:37:56.12,00:38:01.25
Art was not the goal, but the occasion[br]and method for locating our rhythm...

00:38:01.43,00:38:03.83
...and buried possibilities[br]of our time.

00:38:03.99,00:38:09.46
It was about the true discovery of[br]communication. Or the quest for such.

00:38:09.67,00:38:11.69
Finding and losing it.

00:38:11.90,00:38:14.70
We, the unappeased,[br]continued looking...

00:38:14.87,00:38:18.00
...filling silences with[br]wishes, fears, fantasies.

00:38:18.31,00:38:22.80
Driven on by the fact that no matter[br]how empty the world seemed...

00:38:22.98,00:38:26.14
...no matter how[br]degraded and used-up...

00:38:26.35,00:38:30.01
...anything was possible.[br]Given the right circumstances...

00:38:30.22,00:38:33.66
...a new world was just[br]as likely as an old one.

00:38:49.24,00:38:51.90
There are two kinds of sufferers:

00:38:52.18,00:38:54.70
Those who suffer[br]from a lack of life...

00:38:54.88,00:38:58.61
...and those who suffer from[br]an overabundance of life.

00:38:58.72,00:39:02.58
I've always found myself[br]in the second category.

00:39:02.75,00:39:07.28
When you think of it, almost all[br]human behavior and activity...

00:39:07.52,00:39:10.96
...is essentially no different[br]from animal behavior.

00:39:11.16,00:39:15.66
The most advanced technologies and[br]craftsmanship bring us at best...

00:39:15.83,00:39:18.39
...up to the super-chimpanzee level.

00:39:18.67,00:39:24.54
Actually, the gap between, say, Plato[br]or Nietzsche and the average human...

00:39:24.71,00:39:29.01
...is greater than between that[br]chimpanzee and the average human.

00:39:29.18,00:39:31.37
The realm of the real spirit...

00:39:31.58,00:39:36.95
...the true artist, the saint, the[br]philosopher, is rarely achieved.

00:39:37.12,00:39:38.95
Why so few?

00:39:39.39,00:39:44.73
Why is world history and evolution[br]not stories of progress...

00:39:44.90,00:39:48.19
...but an endless and futile[br]addition of zeros?

00:39:48.60,00:39:51.76
No greater values have developed.

00:39:51.94,00:39:56.46
Hell, the Greeks 3000 years[br]ago were just as advanced as we are.

00:39:56.77,00:39:59.74
What are the barriers[br]that keep people...

00:39:59.91,00:40:02.97
...from reaching anywhere near[br]their real potential?

00:40:03.15,00:40:07.91
The answer to that can be found in[br]another question, and that's this:

00:40:08.12,00:40:11.65
Which is the most universal[br]human characteristic?

00:40:11.86,00:40:13.62
Fear...

00:40:14.16,00:40:16.06
...or laziness?

00:40:27.10,00:40:29.30
What are you writing?

00:40:32.18,00:40:34.04
A novel.

00:40:35.61,00:40:37.98
What's the story?

00:40:38.28,00:40:41.31
There's no story. It's just...

00:40:41.62,00:40:44.45
...people, gestures, moments.

00:40:44.66,00:40:48.59
Bits of rapture. Fleeting emotions.

00:40:48.99,00:40:50.89
In short...

00:40:51.56,00:40:54.69
...the greatest stories ever told.

00:40:57.10,00:40:59.36
Are you in the story?

00:41:01.51,00:41:04.27
I don't think so.

00:41:04.44,00:41:09.54
But then I'm kind of reading it[br]and then writing it.

00:41:13.88,00:41:18.62
It was in the desert, the middle of[br]nowhere, on the way to Vegas.

00:41:18.82,00:41:22.99
So you know, every once[br]in a while a car would stop for gas.

00:41:23.16,00:41:26.39
It was the last gas stop before Vegas.

00:41:26.60,00:41:31.86
There was a chair and a cash register.[br]That was all the room there was.

00:41:32.04,00:41:36.03
I was asleep and I heard a noise.

00:41:36.24,00:41:42.41
You know, just like in my mind.[br]So I got up...

00:41:43.78,00:41:46.81
...and I walked out[br]and stood on the curb...

00:41:47.02,00:41:50.48
...where the gas station ends.[br]You know, the driveway.

00:41:50.69,00:41:54.38
I'm rubbing my eyes,[br]trying to see what's going on.

00:41:54.56,00:42:00.62
And way down, at the very end of the[br]gas station, they had tire racks...

00:42:00.80,00:42:02.70
...with chains around them.

00:42:02.87,00:42:06.20
And I see there's[br]an Econoline van down there.

00:42:06.40,00:42:09.03
And a guy with his T-shirt off.

00:42:09.21,00:42:13.54
And he's packing this Econoline van...

00:42:13.71,00:42:16.20
...with all these tires.

00:42:16.41,00:42:20.11
He's got the last two tires[br]in his hands.

00:42:20.95,00:42:27.08
Pushes them into the thing.[br]And I, of course, I go, "Hey, you!"

00:42:27.26,00:42:32.49
This guy turns around.[br]He's got no shirt on. He's sweating.

00:42:32.70,00:42:38.07
Built like a brick shithouse.[br]Pulls out a knife, 12 inches long...

00:42:38.24,00:42:42.19
...and starts running at me[br]as fast as he can, going:

00:42:46.91,00:42:48.28
I'm still:

00:42:50.45,00:42:51.88
"This is wrong. "

00:42:53.22,00:42:54.77
I walked in...

00:42:55.92,00:43:01.69
...stuck my hand behind the register[br]where the owner kept a. 41 revolver.

00:43:01.86,00:43:03.16
I pull it out...

00:43:03.46,00:43:04.79
...cock the trigger...

00:43:04.96,00:43:10.46
...and as I turn around, he's coming[br]through the door. I saw his eyes.

00:43:10.63,00:43:13.57
I'll never forget this guy's eyes.

00:43:13.74,00:43:19.04
He just had bad thoughts[br]about me in his eyes.

00:43:19.21,00:43:23.15
I fired a round and it hit him,[br]boom, right in the chest.

00:43:23.31,00:43:28.31
Bang! As fast as he came in the door,[br]he went out the door.

00:43:28.52,00:43:33.22
He went right up between[br]the two pumps, ethyl and regular.

00:43:33.39,00:43:39.76
He must have been on drugs, on speed[br]or something, because he stood up.

00:43:40.00,00:43:45.02
He still had the knife, and blood[br]was just all over his chest.

00:43:45.20,00:43:50.30
He stood up and went like that,[br]just moved a little. I'm in shock.

00:43:50.47,00:43:56.14
So I held the trigger back and fanned the[br]hammer, it was one of those old-time:

00:43:58.28,00:44:01.08
I blew him out of the gas station.

00:44:01.28,00:44:04.72
Ever since then, I always carry this.

00:44:07.79,00:44:11.89
A well-armed populace[br]is the best defense against tyranny.

00:44:12.10,00:44:14.00
I'll drink to that.

00:44:19.64,00:44:24.90
You know, I haven't fired this in[br]a long time, I don't know if it works.

00:44:25.08,00:44:27.94
Pull the trigger and find out.

00:45:24.17,00:45:28.57
Hey, man, I guess you already[br]took off or something.

00:45:29.37,00:45:35.37
Remind me to tell you about this dream[br]I had. There was some funny stuff.

00:45:35.55,00:45:39.61
All right, man.[br]I guess I'll catch you later. Okay.

00:45:47.09,00:45:51.46
- In the bareback riding.[br]Copenhagen William from Mike Sankey...

00:45:52.56,00:45:55.59
Then, for a hatband,[br]sew it into the inside...

00:45:56.17,00:45:58.16
I do not await the future...

00:45:58.34,00:46:02.27
...anticipating salvation, absolution[br]or even enlightenment.

00:46:02.44,00:46:07.81
I believe that this flawed perfection[br]is sufficient and complete...

00:46:07.98,00:46:11.91
...in every single, ineffable moment.

00:46:12.12,00:46:14.55

- venerable tradition of sorcerers,[br]shamans and visionaries...

00:46:27.16,00:46:30.79
...who have perfected[br]the art of dream travel...

00:46:30.97,00:46:36.56
...the so-called lucid dream state,[br]where, by controlling your dreams...

00:46:36.74,00:46:42.70
...you can discover things beyond your[br]apprehension in your awake state.

00:46:47.92,00:46:49.38
- Winning back-to...

00:46:49.85,00:46:52.22
She tells him what Felix is doing.

00:46:52.39,00:46:55.52
A single ego[br]is an absurdly narrow vantage...

00:46:55.73,00:46:58.13
...from which to view this experience.

00:46:58.30,00:47:02.06
Where most consider their[br]relationship to the universe...

00:47:02.23,00:47:07.07
...I contemplate relationships[br]of my various selves to one another.

00:47:07.54,00:47:11.74
While most people with mobility[br]problems can barely get around...

00:47:11.94,00:47:15.34
...at age 92, Joy Cullison's[br]out seeing the world.

00:47:40.10,00:47:42.13
Hey, how's it going?

00:47:43.81,00:47:47.30
They say dreams are real[br]only as long as they last.

00:47:47.61,00:47:49.48
Can't we say that about life?

00:47:49.85,00:47:54.22
A lot of us are mapping the[br]mind-body relationship of dreams.

00:47:54.75,00:47:58.35
We're called oneironauts,[br]explorers of the dream world.

00:47:58.72,00:48:02.68
There are two opposing states[br]of consciousness...

00:48:02.93,00:48:05.02
...that don't oppose at all.

00:48:05.20,00:48:10.16
In the waking world, the neuro system[br]inhibits the vividness of memories.

00:48:10.33,00:48:12.13
It makes evolutionary sense.

00:48:12.30,00:48:14.90
It'd be maladapted if a predator...

00:48:15.07,00:48:18.10
...could be mistaken[br]for the memory of one...

00:48:18.27,00:48:21.21
...and vice versa.[br]If the memory of a predator...

00:48:21.41,00:48:23.31
...conjured up a perceptual image...

00:48:23.48,00:48:26.61
...we'd run whenever we[br]had a scary thought.

00:48:26.82,00:48:30.01
Your serotonic neurons[br]inhibit hallucinations.

00:48:30.22,00:48:33.71
They themselves are inhibited[br]during REM sleep.

00:48:33.92,00:48:38.09
This allows dreams to appear real[br]but prevents competition...

00:48:38.29,00:48:39.92
...from other perceptions.

00:48:40.10,00:48:43.22
This is why dreams[br]are mistaken for reality.

00:48:43.43,00:48:48.20
To the functional system of neural[br]activity that creates our world...

00:48:48.37,00:48:53.87
...there is no difference between[br]dreaming a perception and an action...

00:48:54.04,00:48:59.71
...and actually the waking[br]perception and action.

00:49:12.36,00:49:16.39
A friend once told me the worst[br]mistake you can make...

00:49:16.60,00:49:20.50
...is to think that you are alive...

00:49:22.37,00:49:25.97
...when really you're asleep[br]in life's waiting room.

00:49:34.68,00:49:41.06
The trick is to combine your waking[br]rational abilities...

00:49:41.26,00:49:44.92
...with the infinite possibilities[br]of your dreams.

00:49:45.09,00:49:48.50
Because if you can do that,[br]you can do anything.

00:49:49.70,00:49:53.14
Ever have a job you hated[br]and worked real hard at?

00:49:53.30,00:49:58.47
A long, hard day of work, finally you[br]go home, get in bed, close your eyes.

00:49:58.81,00:50:05.15
Then you wake up and realize the whole[br]day at work had been a dream.

00:50:10.72,00:50:14.99
It's bad enough you sell[br]your waking life for...

00:50:15.19,00:50:19.86
...minimum wage, but now[br]they get your dreams for free.

00:50:22.03,00:50:24.30
Hey, man, what are you doing here?

00:50:24.47,00:50:28.10
I fancy myself a social lubricator[br]of the dream world...

00:50:28.27,00:50:30.83
...helping people get lucid easier.

00:50:31.01,00:50:34.88
Cut out the fear and anxiety[br]and just rock 'n' roll.

00:50:35.04,00:50:38.31
Becoming lucid, you mean knowing[br]you're dreaming?

00:50:38.52,00:50:44.32
Then you can control it. They're more[br]realistic than non-lucid dreams.

00:50:44.49,00:50:46.48
I just woke from a dream.

00:50:46.72,00:50:50.85
It wasn't typical, more like[br]I was in an alternate universe.

00:50:51.03,00:50:55.49
Yep, it's real. Technically,[br]it's a phenomenon of sleep...

00:50:55.67,00:50:58.29
...but you can have so much[br]fun in dreams.

00:50:58.47,00:51:02.80
- And everyone knows, fun rules.[br]- Yeah.

00:51:02.97,00:51:07.07
- What was going on in your dream?[br]- A lot of people talking.

00:51:07.24,00:51:10.54
Some was absurdist,[br]like from a strange movie.

00:51:10.71,00:51:14.62
Mostly people went off about[br]whatever, really intensely.

00:51:14.82,00:51:16.25
I woke up wondering...

00:51:16.42,00:51:20.01
...where did this stuff come from?[br]- You can control that.

00:51:20.22,00:51:24.39
- You have these dreams a lot?[br]- I always make the best of it.

00:51:24.56,00:51:28.52
You have to realize you're[br]dreaming in the first place.

00:51:28.70,00:51:30.13
To recognize it.

00:51:30.30,00:51:34.40
You have to be able to ask yourself,[br]"Is this a dream?"

00:51:34.57,00:51:38.70
Most people never ask themselves that,[br]awake or asleep.

00:51:39.31,00:51:43.80
People sleepwalk in the waking[br]state and wakewalk through dreams.

00:51:43.98,00:51:45.74
They don't get much out of it.

00:51:45.92,00:51:50.82
What snapped me into realizing[br]I was dreaming was my clock.

00:51:50.99,00:51:55.58
I couldn't read it,[br]like the circuitry was screwed up.

00:51:55.76,00:52:00.86
That's common. Small printed material[br]is pretty tough too. Very unstable.

00:52:01.23,00:52:05.46
Another tip-off is trying[br]to adjust light levels. You can't.

00:52:05.64,00:52:09.59
If you see a light switch nearby,[br]see if it works.

00:52:09.77,00:52:12.30
You can't do that in a lucid dream.

00:52:12.51,00:52:17.97
What the hell? I can fly around, have[br]a conversation with Albert Schweitzer.

00:52:18.15,00:52:21.01
I can explore new[br]dimensions of reality.

00:52:21.22,00:52:26.21
Not to mention, I can have any kind[br]of sex I want. Which is way cool.

00:52:26.42,00:52:28.19
So I can't adjust lights!

00:52:28.36,00:52:32.16
So that's what you do to test[br]if you're dreaming?

00:52:32.33,00:52:35.30
You can train yourself to recognize it.

00:52:35.47,00:52:37.33
Hit a switch now and then.

00:52:37.50,00:52:42.10
If the lights are on and you can't[br]turn them off, you're dreaming.

00:52:42.27,00:52:46.61
Then you can get down to business.[br]And it's unlimited.

00:52:46.78,00:52:49.51
- Know what I've been working on?[br]- What?

00:52:49.68,00:52:53.17
It's way ambitious.[br]But I'm getting better at it.

00:52:53.35,00:52:54.61
You'll dig this.

00:52:54.85,00:52:58.88
Three-sixty vision, man. I can see[br]in all directions. Cool, huh?

00:52:59.42,00:53:03.65
Yeah! Man...[br]Well, I gotta go, man.

00:53:03.83,00:53:07.19
Later. Super perfundo[br]on the early eve of your day.

00:53:07.36,00:53:08.52
What's that mean?

00:53:08.70,00:53:11.53
I've never figured it out.[br]Maybe you can.

00:53:11.70,00:53:14.36
This guy always whispers it in my ear.

00:53:14.54,00:53:17.44
Louis.[br]He's a recurring dream character.

00:54:45.36,00:54:47.59
Cinema, in its essence...

00:54:47.80,00:54:54.29
...is about reproduction of reality,[br]which is, reality is reproduced.

00:54:54.50,00:54:57.03
For him,[br]it's not a storytelling medium.

00:54:57.24,00:54:58.73
He feels like...

00:54:58.88,00:55:03.81
...like film... Like literature[br]is better for telling a story.

00:55:04.01,00:55:08.21
Like if you tell a joke.[br]"A guy walks into a bar...

00:55:08.45,00:55:10.58
...and sees a dwarf. "

00:55:10.82,00:55:16.62
That works. You imagine a guy and a[br]dwarf in a bar, and it's imaginative.

00:55:16.83,00:55:19.89
But in film,[br]you film a specific guy...

00:55:20.10,00:55:25.06
...in a specific bar with a specific[br]dwarf who looks a certain way.

00:55:25.27,00:55:30.93
Like, for Bazin, what[br]the ontology of film has to do with...

00:55:31.14,00:55:33.13
...is what photography has...

00:55:33.34,00:55:37.44
...except it adds time[br]and greater realism.

00:55:37.65,00:55:44.14
So it's about that guy,[br]at that moment, in that space.

00:55:44.39,00:55:47.91
And Bazin is, like, a Christian,[br]so he believes...

00:55:48.16,00:55:51.89
...in God, obviously,[br]and that everything...

00:55:52.09,00:55:54.49
For him, reality and God are the same.

00:55:54.70,00:55:59.60
So what film is actually capturing is,[br]like, God incarnate, creating...

00:55:59.80,00:56:04.47
...and, like this very moment,[br]God is manifesting as this.

00:56:04.67,00:56:07.27
What film would capture[br]here right now...

00:56:07.48,00:56:12.28
...would be God as this table, as you,[br]as me. God looking how we look...

00:56:12.48,00:56:17.25
...saying and thinking what we think,[br]because we're all God manifest.

00:56:17.49,00:56:22.69
So film is a record of God,[br]or the ever-changing face of God.

00:56:22.89,00:56:25.16
You have a mosquito. Want me to...?

00:56:25.36,00:56:28.09
- You got it.[br]- I got it?

00:56:28.30,00:56:33.74
Hollywood has taken film and made it[br]a storytelling medium. You take...

00:56:33.94,00:56:39.14
...books or stories, get a script[br]and find someone who fits it.

00:56:39.31,00:56:42.64
It's ridiculous.[br]It shouldn't be based on the script.

00:56:42.81,00:56:46.54
It should be based on the person[br]or the thing.

00:56:47.08,00:56:52.11
They're right to have the star system.[br]Then it's about that person...

00:56:52.36,00:56:54.08
...instead of the story.

00:56:54.29,00:56:57.95
Truffaut said the best films[br]aren't made...

00:56:58.16,00:57:01.62
The best scripts[br]don't make the best films.

00:57:01.83,00:57:04.53
They have a narrative[br]you're a slave to.

00:57:04.73,00:57:10.26
The best films are the ones[br]that aren't tied to that, slavishly.

00:57:10.47,00:57:13.20
So the narrative thing seems to me...

00:57:13.41,00:57:17.28
There's narrativity to film[br]because it's in time, like music.

00:57:17.45,00:57:22.98
But you don't think of the story of[br]the song. It comes out of the moment.

00:57:23.22,00:57:26.95
That's what film has.[br]It's that moment, which is holy.

00:57:27.16,00:57:30.28
This moment is holy.[br]We walk around like it's not.

00:57:30.46,00:57:34.26
Like there are some holy moments[br]and others are not.

00:57:34.46,00:57:40.66
Like, this moment is holy. Film lets us[br]see that, can frame it so we see it.

00:57:41.64,00:57:46.37
"Holy, holy, holy" moment by moment.[br]But who can live that way?

00:57:46.58,00:57:52.38
Because if I were to look at you and[br]let you be holy, I would stop talking.

00:57:52.58,00:57:56.75
You'd be in the moment.[br]The moment is holy, right?

00:57:56.99,00:57:59.89
Yeah, I'd be open.[br]I'd look in your eyes...

00:58:00.12,00:58:04.56
...I'd cry and I'd feel this stuff,[br]and that's not polite.

00:58:04.76,00:58:06.66
It'd make you uncomfortable.

00:58:06.86,00:58:10.70
You could laugh too.[br]Why would you cry?

00:58:10.90,00:58:15.77
Well, I don't know.[br]For me, I just tend to cry.

00:58:16.24,00:58:18.07
Well, is the...?

00:58:18.27,00:58:22.14
Let's do it right now.[br]Let's have a holy moment.

00:58:46.30,00:58:50.24
Everything is layers.[br]There's the holy moment, then...

00:58:50.44,00:58:56.11
...the awareness of it. Like in film,[br]the actual moment happens...

00:58:56.51,00:59:02.68
...then the character pretends to be[br]in a different reality. It's layers.

00:59:03.99,00:59:07.68
I was in and out of the holy moment,[br]looking at you.

00:59:08.02,00:59:10.96
You can't...[br]You're unique that way, Caveh.

00:59:11.16,00:59:16.76
That's one of the reasons I enjoy you.[br]You can bring me into that.

00:59:36.12,00:59:42.32
If the world is false and nothing[br]is true, then everything is possible.

00:59:42.53,00:59:47.33
On the way to finding what we love, we[br]find what blocks us from our desire.

00:59:47.53,00:59:50.06
Comfort will never be comfortable.

00:59:50.27,00:59:53.06
A systematic questioning of happiness.

00:59:53.27,00:59:59.17
Cut the vocal cords of every empowered[br]speaker and devalue currency.

00:59:59.38,01:00:03.40
To confront the familiar.[br]Society is a fraud so complete...

01:00:03.61,01:00:08.24
...and venal, it demands[br]to be destroyed beyond memory.

01:00:08.48,01:00:10.68
If there's fire, we'll carry gas.

01:00:10.92,01:00:15.36
Interrupt everyday experience[br]and the expectations that go with it.

01:00:15.59,01:00:18.08
Live as if things depend[br]on your actions.

01:00:18.33,01:00:21.89
Rupture the spell[br]of the consumer society...

01:00:22.10,01:00:25.30
...so our repressed desires[br]can come forward.

01:00:25.50,01:00:28.90
Demonstrate what life is[br]and what it could be.

01:00:29.11,01:00:32.40
To immerse ourselves[br]in the oblivion of actions.

01:00:32.61,01:00:36.84
There'll be an intensity never known.[br]To exchange love and hate...

01:00:37.05,01:00:39.41
...terror and redemption.

01:00:39.62,01:00:45.95
Affirmation of freedom so reckless[br]it amounts to a denial of limitation.

01:00:57.13,01:01:00.23
- Hey, what are you doing?[br]- I'm not sure.

01:01:00.77,01:01:03.57
You need any help getting down, sir?

01:01:04.57,01:01:07.24
No, I don't think so.

01:01:08.18,01:01:10.20
Stupid bastard.

01:01:10.41,01:01:13.47
No worse than us.[br]He's all action, no theory.

01:01:14.18,01:01:16.88
We're all theory and no action.

01:01:26.23,01:01:28.29
Why so glum, Mr. Deborg?

01:01:28.50,01:01:33.06
What was missing[br]was felt irretrievable.

01:01:33.60,01:01:39.51
The extreme uncertainties[br]of subsisting without working...

01:01:39.71,01:01:42.73
...made excesses necessary...

01:01:42.95,01:01:45.04
...and breaks definitive.

01:01:45.28,01:01:47.11
To quote Stevenson:

01:01:47.32,01:01:51.08
"Suicide carried off many.

01:01:51.42,01:01:54.72
Drink and the devil...

01:01:54.92,01:01:57.52
...took care of the rest. "

01:02:07.67,01:02:09.26
Hey!

01:02:10.31,01:02:12.33
Are you a dreamer?

01:02:13.68,01:02:15.23
Yeah.

01:02:17.55,01:02:20.91
I haven't seen too many around lately.

01:02:21.25,01:02:23.91
Things have been tough for dreamers.

01:02:24.79,01:02:28.19
They say dreaming's dead.[br]No one does it anymore.

01:02:28.82,01:02:31.59
It's not dead.[br]It's just been forgotten.

01:02:32.06,01:02:33.82
Removed from our language.

01:02:34.03,01:02:37.52
Nobody teaches it,[br]so no one knows it exists.

01:02:39.84,01:02:42.83
The dreamer's banished to obscurity.

01:02:43.54,01:02:46.84
I'm trying to change that.[br]I hope you are too...

01:02:48.01,01:02:50.60
...by dreaming every day.

01:02:51.95,01:02:54.44
Dreaming with our hands and minds.

01:02:55.15,01:02:59.71
Our planet is facing the greatest[br]problems it's ever faced. Ever.

01:02:59.96,01:03:01.72
So don't be bored.

01:03:01.92,01:03:06.29
This is the most exciting time[br]we could have hoped to be alive.

01:03:06.56,01:03:08.93
And things are just starting.

01:03:25.18,01:03:28.95
A thousand years is an instant.[br]There's nothing new.

01:03:29.18,01:03:34.92
The same pattern over and over.[br]The same insights felt long ago.

01:03:35.09,01:03:37.92
There's nothing here for me now.

01:03:38.13,01:03:43.43
Now I remember. This happened[br]to me before. This is why I left.

01:03:45.20,01:03:47.33
You have begun to find answers.

01:03:47.54,01:03:50.27
Though difficult,[br]the rewards will be great.

01:03:50.47,01:03:55.27
Exercise your mind fully,[br]knowing it is only an exercise.

01:03:55.48,01:04:00.21
Build artifacts, solve problems,[br]explore the secrets of the universe.

01:04:00.45,01:04:02.71
Savor input from all the senses.

01:04:02.95,01:04:08.89
Feel joy, sorrow, laughter, empathy.[br]Tuck the memory in your travel bag.

01:04:09.26,01:04:12.59
I remember where I'm from[br]and how I became human.

01:04:12.80,01:04:16.09
Why I hung around.[br]Now my departure is scheduled.

01:04:16.67,01:04:21.86
This way out. Escaping velocity.[br]Not just eternity, but infinity.

01:04:48.86,01:04:51.56
- Excuse me.[br]- Excuse me.

01:04:57.47,01:05:00.70
Could we do that again?[br]I know we haven't met...

01:05:00.91,01:05:03.50
...but I don't want to be an ant.

01:05:04.48,01:05:08.01
We go through life[br]bouncing off one another...

01:05:08.25,01:05:10.98
...continuously on ant autopilot...

01:05:11.22,01:05:15.16
...with nothing really human[br]required of us.

01:05:15.42,01:05:18.52
Stop. Go. Walk here. Drive there.

01:05:18.73,01:05:21.20
All action basically for survival.

01:05:21.40,01:05:25.36
All communication to keep[br]the ant colony buzzing along...

01:05:25.57,01:05:28.04
...in an efficient, polite manner.

01:05:28.24,01:05:33.00
"Here's your change. "[br]"Paper or plastic?" "Credit or debit?"

01:05:33.21,01:05:35.18
"Want ketchup with that?"

01:05:35.38,01:05:39.51
I don't want a straw,[br]I want real human moments.

01:05:39.72,01:05:42.95
I want to see you.[br]I want you to see me.

01:05:43.19,01:05:47.62
I don't want to give that up.[br]I don't want to be an ant, you know?

01:05:48.66,01:05:50.99
Yeah, no...

01:05:51.19,01:05:53.96
...I don't want to be an ant, either.

01:05:54.30,01:05:57.89
Thanks for kind of jostling me there.[br]I've been...

01:05:58.10,01:06:03.73
...on zombie autopilot. I don't feel[br]like an ant, but I look like one.

01:06:04.74,01:06:08.57
D.H. Lawrence had this idea[br]of two people meeting...

01:06:08.78,01:06:11.11
...and instead of just passing...

01:06:11.31,01:06:15.41
...they accept "the confrontation[br]between their souls. "

01:06:16.12,01:06:20.21
It's like freeing the brave,[br]reckless gods within us all.

01:06:20.46,01:06:23.05
Then it's like we have met.

01:06:23.83,01:06:28.42
I'm doing a project, maybe you'll be[br]interested. It's a soap opera...

01:06:28.63,01:06:34.90
...and the characters are the fantasy[br]lives of the performers in it.

01:06:35.10,01:06:40.60
So figure out something you've always[br]wanted to do, or a life you want...

01:06:40.81,01:06:43.74
...something like that.[br]We write that in...

01:06:43.95,01:06:50.44
...then you intersect with others[br]in some typical soap-opera fashion.

01:06:50.72,01:06:55.52
Then I also want to show it live,[br]with the actors present.

01:06:55.72,01:06:58.59
So once the episode's screened...

01:06:58.73,01:07:04.79
...the audience can direct the actors[br]for subsequent episodes with menus.

01:07:05.00,01:07:06.70
It has to do with choices...

01:07:06.90,01:07:11.77
...and honoring people's ability[br]to say what it is they want to see...

01:07:11.97,01:07:15.64
...and consumerism and art[br]and commodity...

01:07:15.84,01:07:21.18
...and if you don't like it, send it[br]back, and you get what you pay for...

01:07:21.42,01:07:25.15
...or just participating, you know,[br]making choices.

01:07:25.39,01:07:27.48
So do you want to do it?

01:07:27.72,01:07:32.89
Yeah, that sounds really cool.[br]I'd love to be in it, but...

01:07:34.06,01:07:39.36
...I gotta ask you a question first.[br]I don't know how to say it, but...

01:07:40.30,01:07:44.17
What's it like to be a character[br]in a dream? Because...

01:07:44.37,01:07:48.97
...I'm not awake right now. I haven't[br]worn a watch since 4th grade.

01:07:49.18,01:07:52.41
I think this is the same watch too.

01:07:53.92,01:07:57.37
I don't know if you're able[br]to answer that question.

01:07:57.62,01:08:02.68
I'm just trying to get a sense[br]of where I am and what's going on.

01:08:02.89,01:08:05.52
What about you? What's your name?

01:08:05.73,01:08:09.53
What's your address?[br]What are you doing?

01:08:11.53,01:08:16.27
I can't really remember right now.[br]I can't really recall.

01:08:16.47,01:08:21.97
But that's beside the point, whether[br]I can dredge up information about...

01:08:22.18,01:08:27.51
...my address, or my mom's[br]maiden name or whatnot.

01:08:27.75,01:08:32.19
I've got the benefit in this reality,[br]if you call it that...

01:08:32.42,01:08:34.72
...of a consistent perspective.

01:08:34.92,01:08:37.52
What is your consistent perspective?

01:08:37.73,01:08:41.49
It's mostly just me[br]dealing with a lot of people...

01:08:41.70,01:08:47.93
...who are exposing me[br]to information and ideas...

01:08:48.14,01:08:50.87
...that seem vaguely familiar.

01:08:51.07,01:08:55.37
But at the same time,[br]it's all very alien to me.

01:08:55.58,01:09:00.14
I'm not in an objective,[br]rational world.

01:09:00.35,01:09:03.81
Like, I've been flying around...

01:09:05.35,01:09:08.32
It's weird,[br]because it's not a fixed state.

01:09:08.52,01:09:11.96
It's more like a whole spectrum[br]of awareness.

01:09:12.19,01:09:15.56
The lucidity wavers.[br]Right now I know I'm dreaming.

01:09:15.76,01:09:18.60
We're even talking about it. This is...

01:09:18.80,01:09:23.03
...the most in myself[br]and in my thoughts I've been so far.

01:09:23.24,01:09:26.73
I'm talking about being in a dream.

01:09:26.94,01:09:30.04
But I'm beginning to think...

01:09:30.25,01:09:33.74
...it's something I don't have[br]any precedent for.

01:09:33.95,01:09:36.65
It's totally unique.

01:09:36.89,01:09:40.41
The quality of the environment...

01:09:40.66,01:09:45.75
...and the information I'm receiving.[br]Like your soap opera, for example.

01:09:45.96,01:09:48.59
That's a really cool idea!

01:09:48.80,01:09:52.16
I didn't come up with that.[br]It's outside myself...

01:09:52.37,01:09:56.17
...like something transmitted[br]to me externally.

01:09:56.37,01:09:58.40
I don't know what this is.

01:09:58.61,01:10:03.24
We think we're so limited[br]by the world and the confines...

01:10:03.45,01:10:05.94
...but we're really[br]just creating them.

01:10:06.15,01:10:12.05
You keep trying to figure it out,[br]but now you know you're dreaming...

01:10:12.25,01:10:16.71
...you can do anything.[br]You're dreaming, but you're awake.

01:10:16.96,01:10:18.89
You have...

01:10:19.26,01:10:23.36
...so many options,[br]and that's what life is about.

01:10:23.57,01:10:28.09
I understand what you're saying.[br]It's up to me, I'm the dreamer.

01:10:28.30,01:10:29.60
It's weird.

01:10:29.81,01:10:31.83
So much of the information...

01:10:32.04,01:10:34.74
...these people have been imparting...

01:10:34.94,01:10:38.67
...has got this[br]really heavy connotation to it.

01:10:39.25,01:10:41.58
Well, how do you feel?

01:10:42.32,01:10:45.08
Sometimes I feel kind of isolated.

01:10:45.32,01:10:50.26
Most of the time, I feel connected,[br]engaged in this active process.

01:10:50.49,01:10:56.23
Which is weird. Most of the time[br]I've been passive, not responding...

01:10:56.43,01:10:57.90
...except for now.

01:10:58.10,01:11:00.66
I've let information wash over me.

01:11:00.87,01:11:05.07
It's not necessarily passive[br]to not respond verbally.

01:11:05.27,01:11:10.51
We're communicating[br]on so many levels simultaneously.

01:11:10.71,01:11:14.08
Perhaps you're perceiving directly.

01:11:14.78,01:11:20.19
Most of the people I've encountered[br]and the things I want to say...

01:11:20.39,01:11:24.26
...it's like they say it for me,[br]almost at my cue.

01:11:24.46,01:11:28.56
It's complete unto itself.

01:11:29.26,01:11:32.39
It's not a bad dream.[br]It's a great dream.

01:11:32.60,01:11:34.19
But...

01:11:34.40,01:11:39.03
...it's so unlike any other dream[br]I've ever had before.

01:11:39.24,01:11:42.27
It's like "the" dream.

01:11:43.48,01:11:45.74
It's like I'm being prepared[br]for something.

01:12:15.18,01:12:18.74
"On this bridge," Lorca warns...

01:12:18.95,01:12:21.01
..."life is not a dream.

01:12:21.22,01:12:23.08
Beware and...

01:12:23.32,01:12:27.31
...beware and beware. "

01:12:27.56,01:12:32.82
So many think because "then"[br]happened, "now" isn't.

01:12:33.03,01:12:38.47
But didn't I mention? The ongoing[br]"wow" is happening right now.

01:12:38.67,01:12:42.00
We are all coauthors[br]of this dancing exuberance...

01:12:42.17,01:12:45.20
...where even our inabilities[br]are having a roast.

01:12:45.41,01:12:50.04
We are the authors of ourselves,[br]coauthoring a Dostoyevsky novel...

01:12:50.25,01:12:51.97
...starring clowns.

01:12:52.18,01:12:54.81
This thing we're involved with,[br]the world...

01:12:55.05,01:12:59.58
...is an opportunity to exhibit[br]how exciting alienation can be.

01:12:59.82,01:13:02.52
Life is a matter of a miracle...

01:13:02.72,01:13:07.79
...collected by moments flabbergasted[br]to be in each other's presence.

01:13:08.00,01:13:09.55
The world is an exam...

01:13:09.76,01:13:13.50
...to see if we can rise[br]into the direct experiences.

01:13:13.70,01:13:17.30
Eyesight is a test[br]to see if we can see beyond it.

01:13:17.51,01:13:20.41
Matter is a test for our curiosity.

01:13:20.61,01:13:23.70
Doubt is an exam for our vitality.

01:13:24.08,01:13:29.81
Thomas Mann wrote that he would rather[br]participate in life than write.

01:13:30.15,01:13:34.25
Giacometti was once run down by a car.

01:13:34.49,01:13:37.72
He recalled falling[br]into a lucid faint...

01:13:37.93,01:13:39.72
...a sudden exhilaration...

01:13:39.93,01:13:43.59
...as he realized[br]something was happening to him.

01:13:43.87,01:13:48.63
One assumes you can't understand[br]life and live simultaneously.

01:13:48.84,01:13:53.37
I don't agree entirely. Which is[br]to say, I don't exactly disagree.

01:13:53.71,01:13:58.51
I would say that life understood[br]is life lived.

01:13:58.71,01:14:00.87
But the paradoxes bug me.

01:14:01.08,01:14:05.78
I can learn to love, and make love,[br]to the paradoxes that bug me.

01:14:06.02,01:14:08.49
And on romantic evenings of self...

01:14:08.72,01:14:11.75
...I go salsa dancing[br]with my confusion.

01:14:12.03,01:14:15.19
Before you drift off, don't forget...

01:14:15.40,01:14:17.19
...which is to say, remember.

01:14:17.40,01:14:22.53
Because remembering is so much more[br]a psychotic activity than forgetting.

01:14:22.74,01:14:25.21
Lorca, in that same poem, said...

01:14:25.41,01:14:29.71
...that the iguana will bite[br]those who do not dream.

01:14:30.75,01:14:33.87
And, as one realizes...

01:14:34.08,01:14:39.52
...that one is a dream figure[br]in another person's dream...

01:14:40.22,01:14:43.66
...that is self-awareness.

01:15:08.15,01:15:11.14
You haven't met yourself yet.

01:15:12.79,01:15:16.99
But the advantage to meeting others[br]in the meantime...

01:15:17.19,01:15:21.93
...is that one of them[br]may present you to yourself.

01:15:23.90,01:15:28.73
Examine the nature of everything[br]you observe.

01:15:28.94,01:15:32.20
For instance,[br]you might find yourself...

01:15:32.41,01:15:36.78
...walking through[br]a dream parking lot.

01:15:36.98,01:15:41.01
And, yes, those are dream feet[br]inside your dream shoes.

01:15:41.38,01:15:43.28
Part of your dream self.

01:15:43.49,01:15:47.11
And so, the person you appear to be[br]in the dream...

01:15:47.36,01:15:50.12
...cannot be who you really are.

01:15:50.33,01:15:52.35
This is an image...

01:15:52.56,01:15:55.22
...a mental model.

01:16:16.32,01:16:20.85
- Do you remember me?[br]- No, I don't think so.

01:16:21.36,01:16:26.35
At the station? You were on the[br]pay phone and you looked at me...

01:16:26.56,01:16:28.53
...a few times.

01:16:29.60,01:16:32.93
I remember that,[br]but I don't remember that being you.

01:16:33.80,01:16:35.83
Are you sure?

01:16:38.14,01:16:40.37
Maybe not.

01:16:40.71,01:16:42.90
I was sitting down...

01:16:43.11,01:16:46.10
...and you were looking at me.

01:17:40.34,01:17:44.47
My little friend, dream no more.[br]It's really here.

01:17:44.67,01:17:46.97
It's called Efferdent Plus.

01:17:47.18,01:17:52.41
In hell, you sink. In heaven, you rise[br]to your fullness of love.

01:17:53.58,01:17:57.24
Hurry up! Come on, get in the car.[br]Let's go.

01:17:57.75,01:18:01.78
The story goes like this:[br]Billy Wilder runs into Louis Malle.

01:18:02.02,01:18:04.36
This was the late '50s, early '60s.

01:18:04.56,01:18:09.26
Malle had just made his most expensive[br]film, which cost $ 21/2 million.

01:18:09.46,01:18:12.16
Wilder asks him what the film's about.

01:18:12.37,01:18:15.20
Malle says, "It's a dream[br]within a dream. "

01:18:15.40,01:18:18.57
Wilder says,[br]"You just lost $ 21/2 million. "

01:18:19.77,01:18:22.30
I feel a little apprehensive.

01:18:29.65,01:18:32.62
For years, the notion[br]that life is a dream...

01:18:32.85,01:18:36.95
...has been a pervasive theme[br]of philosophers and poets.

01:18:37.16,01:18:41.32
Doesn't it make sense that death[br]would be wrapped in a dream?

01:18:41.53,01:18:47.53
That, after death, your conscious life[br]would continue in a dream body?

01:18:47.74,01:18:52.10
It would be the same dream body[br]as in your everyday dream life...

01:18:52.31,01:18:57.54
...except that in the post-mortal[br]state, you could never again wake up.

01:18:57.75,01:19:00.65
Never again return[br]to your physical body.

01:19:11.29,01:19:17.09
As the pattern gets more intricate,[br]being swept along isn't enough.

01:19:39.85,01:19:41.69
What's the word, turd?

01:19:43.19,01:19:47.36
- Hey, do you also drive a boat-car?[br]- A what?

01:19:47.73,01:19:51.36
You gave me a ride in a car[br]that was also a boat.

01:19:51.57,01:19:56.13
No, I don't have a "boat-car. "[br]I don't know what you mean.

01:19:56.34,01:20:01.93
This must be parallel universe night.[br]That cat who just ran out the door?

01:20:02.14,01:20:04.77
He comes up and I say,[br]"What's the word?"

01:20:04.98,01:20:08.75
He lays down a burrito,[br]looks at me and says:

01:20:08.98,01:20:11.75
"I've returned[br]from the valley of death.

01:20:11.99,01:20:14.98
I rapturously breathe in[br]the odors of life.

01:20:15.22,01:20:21.36
I've been to oblivion. I ferment[br]the desire to remember everything. "

01:20:23.56,01:20:25.59
So, what did you say to that?

01:20:26.10,01:20:28.30
Well, I mean, what could I say?

01:20:28.50,01:20:32.27
I said, "If you microwave that,[br]poke holes in the plastic...

01:20:32.47,01:20:37.60
...because they explode,[br]and I'm tired of cleaning up burrito. "

01:20:42.72,01:20:44.65
The jalapeos dry up.

01:20:45.52,01:20:47.85
They're like little wheels.

01:20:51.46,01:20:54.79
When it was over,[br]all I could think about was how...

01:20:55.00,01:20:58.56
...this entire notion of oneself...

01:20:58.77,01:20:59.76
...what we are...

01:20:59.97,01:21:03.66
...is just this logical structure.

01:21:03.87,01:21:08.90
A place to momentarily house[br]all the abstractions.

01:21:09.41,01:21:12.00
It was a time to become conscious...

01:21:12.21,01:21:16.51
...to give form and coherence[br]to the mystery.

01:21:16.75,01:21:20.15
And I had been a part of that.[br]It was a gift.

01:21:21.36,01:21:26.76
Life was raging all around me,[br]and every moment was magical.

01:21:27.33,01:21:33.60
I loved all the people, dealing with[br]all the contradictory impulses.

01:21:33.80,01:21:38.57
That's what I loved the most,[br]connecting with the people.

01:21:39.11,01:21:42.51
Looking back, that's all[br]that really mattered.

01:22:39.93,01:22:44.60
Kierkegaard's last words were,[br]"Sweep me up. "

01:25:40.85,01:25:42.61
- Hey, man.[br]- Hey.

01:25:49.62,01:25:54.93
Weren't you in the boat-car?[br]The guy with the hat gave me a ride...

01:25:55.13,01:25:58.86
...in his car-boat thing.[br]You were in the back seat.

01:25:59.07,01:26:02.66
I'm not saying you don't know[br]what you're talking about...

01:26:02.87,01:26:05.36
...but I don't know[br]what you're talking about.

01:26:05.57,01:26:10.88
You guys let me off at this specific[br]spot you gave him directions to.

01:26:11.08,01:26:13.67
I get out,[br]ended up getting hit by a car.

01:26:13.88,01:26:16.08
Then I woke up. I was dreaming.

01:26:16.32,01:26:21.88
Later I found out I was still[br]dreaming, dreaming that I'd woken up.

01:26:22.12,01:26:25.32
False awakenings,[br]I used to have those a lot.

01:26:25.53,01:26:29.05
But I'm still in it now.[br]I can't get out of it.

01:26:29.26,01:26:34.39
It's been going on forever.[br]I keep waking up into another dream.

01:26:34.60,01:26:38.60
I'm getting creeped out, like[br]I'm talking to dead people.

01:26:38.81,01:26:42.07
This woman on TV tells me how death...

01:26:42.28,01:26:46.24
...is this dream-time[br]that exists out of life.

01:26:47.45,01:26:50.18
I'm starting to think I'm dead.

01:26:52.59,01:26:54.88
Let me tell you about a dream I had.

01:26:55.09,01:27:00.36
When someone says that, usually[br]you're in for a very boring few minutes.

01:27:00.56,01:27:03.09
But what else are you gonna do?

01:27:03.30,01:27:08.43
- I read this essay by Philip K. Dick.[br]- In your dream?

01:27:08.64,01:27:12.50
No, I read it before the dream.[br]It was the preamble.

01:27:12.71,01:27:16.40
It was about that book,[br]Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said.

01:27:16.61,01:27:21.84
- He won an award for that one.[br]- That's the one he wrote really fast.

01:27:22.05,01:27:26.49
It just flowed out of him.[br]He felt he was channeling it.

01:27:26.69,01:27:30.05
So four years later,[br]he was at this party.

01:27:30.26,01:27:34.02
He met a woman with the same name[br]as the woman in the book.

01:27:34.23,01:27:38.13
Her boyfriend had the same name[br]as the boyfriend in the book.

01:27:38.33,01:27:41.53
She had an affair[br]with the chief of police.

01:27:41.74,01:27:45.26
He had the same name[br]as the chief in his book.

01:27:45.47,01:27:49.24
Everything she's saying[br]is right out of his book.

01:27:49.44,01:27:53.00
That really freaks him out,[br]but what can he do?

01:27:53.21,01:27:56.41
Shortly after that,[br]he was mailing a letter...

01:27:56.65,01:28:01.82
...and he saw this kind of[br]shady-looking guy standing by his car.

01:28:02.02,01:28:06.96
But instead of avoiding him,[br]he said, "Can I help you?"

01:28:07.16,01:28:09.56
The guy said, "I ran out of gas. "

01:28:09.76,01:28:13.89
He hands him some money,[br]which he never would've done.

01:28:14.10,01:28:15.83
He gets home and thinks:

01:28:16.04,01:28:20.06
"This guy can't get to a gas station.[br]He's out of gas. "

01:28:20.27,01:28:25.58
So he goes back, finds the guy[br]and takes him to a gas station.

01:28:25.91,01:28:29.85
As he pulls up he thinks,[br]"This is in my book too.

01:28:30.22,01:28:33.74
This exact station. This exact guy.[br]Everything. "

01:28:33.99,01:28:37.36
So this whole episode[br]is kind of creepy, right?

01:28:37.56,01:28:41.59
He's telling his priest[br]how he wrote this book...

01:28:41.80,01:28:45.23
...and four years later[br]all these things happened.

01:28:45.43,01:28:49.20
And the priest says,[br]"That's the Book of Acts. "

01:28:49.40,01:28:51.96
He's like, "I've never read it. "

01:28:52.17,01:28:56.08
So he reads the Book of Acts,[br]and it's uncanny.

01:28:56.28,01:29:00.08
Even the characters' names[br]are the same as in the Bible.

01:29:00.28,01:29:03.88
The Book of Acts[br]takes place in 50 A.D.

01:29:04.12,01:29:08.05
So Dick had this theory[br]that time was an illusion...

01:29:08.29,01:29:10.45
...and that we were all in 50 A.D.

01:29:10.66,01:29:14.42
The reason he wrote this book[br]was that he somehow...

01:29:14.63,01:29:17.76
...punctured through[br]this veil of time.

01:29:18.10,01:29:22.19
He'd seen what was going on[br]in the Book of Acts.

01:29:22.40,01:29:26.81
He was really into Gnosticism[br]and the idea that this demon...

01:29:27.01,01:29:30.77
...created this illusion of time[br]to make us forget...

01:29:30.98,01:29:36.31
...that Christ was to return[br]and the kingdom of God would arrive.

01:29:36.55,01:29:41.15
Someone's trying to make us forget[br]that God is imminent.

01:29:41.39,01:29:43.82
That's what time and history is.

01:29:44.02,01:29:48.09
This kind of continuous[br]daydream or distraction.

01:29:48.30,01:29:53.06
I read it and thought, "That's weird. "[br]And that night I had a dream.

01:29:53.27,01:29:56.60
There was this guy who[br]was supposed to be psychic.

01:29:56.80,01:29:59.83
But I was, like,[br]"He's not really a psychic. "

01:30:00.04,01:30:05.00
Then suddenly I start floating,[br]levitating up to the ceiling.

01:30:05.35,01:30:10.48
As I almost go through the roof,[br]I'm like, "Okay, I believe you. "

01:30:10.72,01:30:14.52
And I float down,[br]and as my feet touch the ground...

01:30:14.72,01:30:19.32
...the psychic turns into a woman[br]in a green dress, Lady Gregory.

01:30:19.53,01:30:22.96
Lady Gregory was Yeats' patron,[br]this Irish person.

01:30:23.16,01:30:25.60
Though I'd never seen her image...

01:30:25.80,01:30:30.10
...I was sure that this was[br]the face of Lady Gregory.

01:30:30.30,01:30:32.77
So Lady Gregory turns to me and says:

01:30:32.97,01:30:36.20
"Let me explain[br]the nature of the universe.

01:30:36.41,01:30:40.47
Philip K. Dick is right about time,[br]but wrong that it's 50 A.D.

01:30:40.68,01:30:45.64
Actually, there's only one instant,[br]right now. And it's eternity.

01:30:45.89,01:30:51.02
It's an instant in which God[br]is posing a question, which is:

01:30:51.23,01:30:56.39
'Do you wanna be one with eternity,[br]do you wanna be in heaven? '

01:30:56.60,01:31:00.56
And we're all saying,[br]'No, thank you. Not just yet. "'

01:31:00.77,01:31:05.33
So time is just this constant[br]saying no to God's invitation.

01:31:05.54,01:31:09.87
That's what time is.[br]It's no more 50 A.D. Than it's 2001.

01:31:10.08,01:31:14.24
There's just one instant,[br]and that's what we're always in.

01:31:14.65,01:31:19.48
Then she tells me that this is[br]the narrative of everyone's life.

01:31:19.69,01:31:23.71
Behind the huge difference,[br]there is but one story...

01:31:23.96,01:31:26.43
...of moving from the no[br]to the yes.

01:31:26.66,01:31:29.65
All of life is,[br]"No, thank you. No, thank you. "

01:31:29.86,01:31:32.59
Then ultimately it's, "Yes, I give in.

01:31:32.80,01:31:37.17
Yes, I accept. Yes, I embrace. "[br]That's the journey.

01:31:37.37,01:31:41.21
Everyone gets to the yes[br]in the end, right?

01:31:41.41,01:31:42.43
Right.

01:31:42.64,01:31:46.41
So we continue walking,[br]and my dog runs over to me.

01:31:46.61,01:31:49.38
I'm so happy.[br]He's been dead for years.

01:31:49.62,01:31:53.42
So I'm petting him,[br]and there's this gross stuff...

01:31:53.62,01:31:55.95
...coming out of his stomach.

01:31:56.16,01:31:59.15
I look over at Lady Gregory,[br]and she coughs.

01:31:59.36,01:32:01.39
She's like, "Excuse me. "

01:32:01.60,01:32:06.03
And vomit dribbles down her chin.[br]It smells really bad.

01:32:06.23,01:32:11.07
And I think,[br]"That's not just the smell of vomit.

01:32:11.27,01:32:16.40
That's the smell of dead-person vomit. "[br]So it's, like, doubly foul.

01:32:16.61,01:32:22.01
I realize I'm in the land of the dead.[br]Everyone around me was dead.

01:32:22.22,01:32:26.15
My dog had been dead 10 years,[br]Lady Gregory a lot longer.

01:32:26.35,01:32:30.19
When I woke up, I was like,[br]"That wasn't a dream.

01:32:30.39,01:32:34.62
That was a visitation[br]to this place, the land of the dead. "

01:32:34.83,01:32:37.32
So how did you finally get out of it?

01:32:37.53,01:32:41.70
It was, like, one of those[br]life-altering experiences.

01:32:41.90,01:32:45.00
I never looked at the world[br]the same way again.

01:32:45.21,01:32:48.47
But how did you finally[br]get out of the dream?

01:32:48.68,01:32:51.37
That's my problem. I'm trapped.

01:32:51.58,01:32:56.41
I keep thinking I'm waking up,[br]but I'm still in a dream.

01:32:56.65,01:33:00.71
I wanna wake up for real.[br]How do you really wake up?

01:33:00.95,01:33:04.69
I don't know.[br]I'm not very good at that anymore.

01:33:04.89,01:33:09.92
But if that's what you're thinking,[br]you should, if you can.

01:33:10.13,01:33:13.19
Because someday, you won't be able to.

01:33:13.27,01:33:16.36
But it's easy. You know, just wake up.
