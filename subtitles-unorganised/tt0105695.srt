1
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,400
No, please! No! Please!

2
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,800
Davey!

3
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,200
- Come running, lad!
- Please don't!

4
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,500
- Stop it!
- Brand you like a damn steer!

5
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,300
- Bitch!
- No, please!

6
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,400
Hold the bitch! Hold her!

7
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,800
Hold her or I'll cut her tits off!

8
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,800
Go get Skinny! Quick!

9
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,700
Mike, don't!

10
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Skinny!

11
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,800
Think it's funny?

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Skinny, get the gun!

13
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,200
Get off of her, cowboy.

14
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,300
- They wouldn't let you settle it?
- You know Skinny.

15
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,000
He says he'll shoot them.

16
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,500
I says, "You can't."
He says, "Get Little Bill."

17
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,100
I says, "He's sleeping."
But he don't care.

18
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,800
He'll shoot them boys soon.

19
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,100
She dying?

20
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,100
She'll live.

21
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,100
She didn't steal nothing
or touch his poke.

22
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,700
When she seen his
teensy little pecker...

23
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,600
...she giggled.
She didn't know no better.

24
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,800
Hang them, Little Bill.

25
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,700
Go to the office and get the bullwhip.

26
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,300
A whipping's all they
get after what they done?

27
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,600
- It ain't no little thing.
- But what they done--

28
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,100
Alice!

29
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,600
Shut up!

30
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,900
- Whipping won't settle this.
- No?

31
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,800
Here's a contract between me and
Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut whore.

32
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,700
I brought her from Boston,
paid her expenses and all.

33
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,400
I got a contract that represents
an investment of capital.

34
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,900
Property.

35
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,900
Damaged property.

36
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,500
Like if I hamstrung one of their ponies.

37
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,100
You think nobody'll fuck her now?

38
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,100
Hell, no!

39
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,300
Leastways, won't pay to do it!

40
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,800
Nobody's going to pay good money
for a cut-up whore!

41
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,000
You boys are off the Bar T.

42
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,100
Got your own ponies?

43
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,400
Yeah, I got four.

44
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,500
Six.

45
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,900
Guess you want no trial, no fuss?

46
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,800
No, sir.

47
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,600
All right.

48
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,800
You did the cutting.

49
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,700
This fall, you bring in
five ponies to Skinny.

50
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,500
Five?

51
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,000
And you...

52
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,400
...bring two.

53
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,700
- You give them over, hear?
- Yes, sir.

54
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,800
The whip.

55
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
Maybe we don't need it now.

56
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,400
I'll tell you, come the spring,
Skinny don't have those ponies....

57
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,600
- ...I'll come looking for you.
- You ain't whipping them?

58
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,700
I fined them instead, Alice.

59
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,500
Skinny gets some ponies and that's it?!

60
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,400
That ain't fair.

61
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,000
That ain't fair!

62
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,500
Haven't you seen enough blood tonight?

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,500
Hell, Alice...

64
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,100
...it ain't like they was
tramps or loafers or...

65
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,000
...bad men. They were just...

66
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,200
...hardworking boys that were foolish.

67
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,200
- If they was wicked in a regular way--
- Like whores?

68
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,800
Tend to Delilah.

69
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,300
Go ahead.

70
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,600
I got $85.

71
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,100
I don't know.

72
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,000
If Delilah doesn't care,
what are we so riled up about?

73
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,400
We let them smelly fools
ride us like horses...

74
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,800
...doesn't mean we must let
them brand us like horses.

75
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,700
Maybe we ain't nothing
but whores, but...

76
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,200
...by God, we ain't horses!

77
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,400
I got $112.

78
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,400
That's everything.

79
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,100
And you, Faith?

80
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,300
200.

81
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,500
240... dollars.

82
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,000
Jesus, what you been doing?

83
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,700
Giving Skinny something special?

84
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,800
She laughs.

85
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,200
With what Kate got, and Silky,
me and Little Sue....

86
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,900
It ain't enough.

87
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,800
Not yet, maybe.

88
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,400
You don't look like no son-of-a-
bitching cold-blooded assassin.

89
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,500
Say what?

90
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,100
You call yourself Mr. William Munny.

91
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,600
You have me confused with
someone else, mister.

92
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,100
Shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?

93
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,100
Hey, Pa!

94
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,900
What, son?

95
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,900
Two more hogs got the fever.

96
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,900
You shot Charlie Pepper.

97
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,400
You killed William Harvey and
robbed that train in Missouri.

98
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,800
Hold on.

99
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,700
Son, get those hogs separated there.

100
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,700
Penny, help your brother.

101
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,100
That one's sick too.

102
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,800
We'll talk inside.

103
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So you're Pete Sothow's nephew?

104
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,500
I thought you'd come to kill me for
something I'd done in the old days.

105
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,700
I could have.

106
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,000
Easy.

107
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,900
I guess maybe so.

108
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,200
You don't look like no meaner-than-hell,
cold-blooded damn killer.

109
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,000
Maybe I ain't.

110
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,500
Uncle Pete says you was the meanest
goddamn son-of-a-bitch alive.

111
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,000
And if I wanted a
partner for a killing...

112
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,300
...you were the worst one.

113
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,500
Meaning the best.

114
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,300
Because you're as cold as snow...

115
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,300
...and don't have no
weak nerve nor fear.

116
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,300
Pete said that?

117
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,100
He did.

118
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,600
I'm a killer myself, but I
haven't killed as many as you...

119
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,400
...because of my youth.

120
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,000
Schofield Kid, they call me.

121
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,900
Why?

122
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,400
You from Schofield?

123
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,700
No, it's on account of my...

124
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,300
...Schofield-Smith & Wesson pistol.

125
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,300
How about it?

126
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,800
How about what?

127
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,400
How about being my partner?

128
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,500
I'm heading north in
through Niobrara to Wyoming.

129
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,100
Kill two no-good cowboys.

130
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,000
For what?

131
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,100
For cutting up a lady.

132
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,000
Her face.

133
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,000
Cut her eyes out, her ears off.

134
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,900
They even cut her teets.

135
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,500
Jesus.

136
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,400
$1,000 reward, Will.

137
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,000
500 each.

138
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,400
I can't move those damn pigs!

139
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,900
Watch your cussing.

140
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,100
Do your best. Go to the
pump and get cleaned up.

141
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,700
Come on.

142
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,200
I ain't like that anymore, Kid.

143
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,900
It was whiskey done it as
much as anything else.

144
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,400
I ain't had a drop in over 10 years.

145
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,300
My wife...

146
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,300
...cured me...

147
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,000
...of drink and...

148
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,500
...wickedness.

149
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,500
You don't look so prosperous.

150
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,300
You could buy her a new
dress with your half.

151
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,200
You could buy your wife a fancy--

152
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,100
She's passed on.

153
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,300
Been gone near three years now.

154
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,100
Don't tell anyone about the reward.
I don't need no one else trying to collect.

155
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,900
Don't see no one.

156
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,300
Change your mind, you could catch me.

157
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,900
I'll ride due west for the
trail headed north into Wyoming.

158
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,600
Let's separate those hogs.

159
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,000
Two others.

160
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,800
I think they got the fever.

161
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,200
Took you boys a while.

162
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,600
A few more days and I was
going to call on the sheriff.

163
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,200
How about that?

164
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,400
The river was all swelled up.
Couldn't cross it.

165
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,300
I bet. Get them horses to the livery.

166
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,100
Take that one over around the back.

167
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,600
Now here's a beauty.

168
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,900
You got my two. This one ain't yours.

169
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,700
We'll see about that.

170
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,700
Bastards! Get out of town!

171
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,800
Get out of here!

172
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,900
You are very sick sons-of-bitches!

173
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,800
Don't come back, butcher!

174
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,500
This here pony...

175
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,900
...I brung for the lady my partner cut.

176
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,800
She's the best.

177
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,600
Better than what I gave him.

178
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,800
She can sell her...

179
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,900
...or do what she wants.

180
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,800
A pony?

181
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,700
She ain't got no face left
and you give her a mangy pony?

182
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,300
She ain't mangy!

183
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,500
Get out of here!

184
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,400
We don't need your goddamn charity!

185
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,300
Get out of our town and don't come back!

186
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,100
Get out of our town!

187
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,500
Did Pa use to kill folks?

188
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,400
I could tell your ma liked
those flowers I gave her.

189
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,600
She ain't a saddle horse no more, Pa.
Ain't used to the feel.

190
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,400
Take care of your sister, son.

191
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,100
Kill a few chickens if you must and
keep those hogs with fever separate.

192
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,500
If you have any problem, go see
Sally Two Trees at Ned Logan's.

193
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,700
Ain't been in the saddle
myself in a while.

194
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,200
She's getting even with me
for the sins of my youth.

195
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,400
In my youth before I met
your dear departed ma...

196
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,900
...I was weak and given
to mistreating animals.

197
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,400
This horse and those hogs over there...

198
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,300
...are getting even for
the cruelty I inflicted.

199
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,800
I used to be able to cuss
and whip a horse like this...

200
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,700
...but your ma showed me
the error of my ways.

201
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,800
I'll be back in 2 weeks.

202
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,500
The spirit of your dear
departed ma watches over you.

203
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,800
- Where'd you get the money?
- We ain't got any!

204
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,900
- You told them cowboys you had!
- We was lying!

205
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,000
Lying?

206
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,100
What if somebody comes to collect?

207
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,800
You going to hump them
a thousand times?

208
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,400
The people come for that thousand
won't tolerate you not having it!

209
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,900
They won't just cut up your face!

210
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,100
You stupid bitches.

211
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,800
Stupid bitches.

212
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,600
Shit!

213
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Damn it! Jesus!

214
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,400
Get your finger?

215
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,200
Hello, Skinny.

216
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,500
You snuck up on me.

217
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,800
Like her?

218
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,000
I heard you done the roof yourself.

219
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,400
Roof?

220
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,900
Jesus, I did practically
the whole damn thing myself.

221
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,800
The Roberts boy carried wood
for me, but that's all.

222
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,500
What's that wood?

223
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,900
I'm building a porch here so I can
sit of an evening and smoke my pipe...

224
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,400
...and drink coffee
and watch the sunset.

225
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,100
Came out here just to
take a look at her?

226
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,000
Them whores...

227
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,200
...been humping all them cowboys been
through town the last two weeks.

228
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Shit.

229
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,700
We got railroad barons
and cattle barons.

230
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,100
You'll be the first billiard baron.

231
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,200
They been humping and telling
every bowlegged one of them...

232
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,500
...they'll pay $1,000 to whoever...

233
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,700
...kills the two boys
that cut up Delilah.

234
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,000
Those cowboys are riding that
beef down to Kansas and Cheyenne?

235
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,900
All week long?

236
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,400
I didn't hear till last night myself.

237
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,400
The word's got all the
way to Texas by now.

238
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,800
Nobody will come clear from Texas.

239
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,900
They got all that money?

240
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,900
Women can lie. Ask where the
money is, they say they got none.

241
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,200
But the five of them could have it.

242
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,800
Maybe.

243
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,900
That much?

244
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
You could run off them two cowboys.

245
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
I could run off them whores.

246
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,100
They'll just up and
run anyhow, them two.

247
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,100
They'll stay out at the Bar T.

248
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,400
Close to their friends.

249
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,900
Shit, could be nobody won't come at all.

250
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,400
Got to go. I like your house.

251
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,000
It's Will.

252
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
Come in out of the sun.

253
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,500
See to Will's horse.

254
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,600
What you doing here?

255
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,300
Just thought I'd drop in on you.

256
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,500
We ain't bad men no more.

257
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,300
We're farmers.

258
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,900
Should be easy killing them, if
they don't go on down to Texas.

259
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,000
How long since you fired a gun
at a man, Will? Ten years?

260
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,000
Eleven.

261
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,100
Easy, huh?

262
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,100
It wasn't all that easy even back then.

263
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,500
And we were young and full of beans.

264
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
If you was mad at them...

265
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,400
...over some wrong, I
could see shooting them.

266
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,600
We done stuff for money before.

267
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,700
We thought we did.

268
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,900
What'd these fellows do?

269
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,900
Cheat at cards? Steal some strays?
Spit on a rich fellow? What?

270
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,600
They cut up a woman.

271
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,300
Cut her face, cut her eyes out,
cut her fingers off, cut her tits.

272
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,400
Everything but her cunny, I suppose.

273
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,700
I'll be dogged.

274
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,900
Guess they got it coming.

275
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,800
Of course, Will...

276
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,800
...if Claudia was alive,
you wouldn't do this.

277
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,500
Could you look in on my
youngsters next week?

278
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,000
Got some hogs to separate.

279
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,200
How long will you be gone?

280
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,300
Two weeks, I guess.

281
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,300
What's this Kid like?

282
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,600
Three ways?

283
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,300
I see you still have that Spencer rifle.

284
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,300
And I can still knock the
eye out of a bird flying.

285
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,600
Jesus.

286
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,600
He must be moving right along.

287
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,700
We'll come across him
tomorrow, I reckon.

288
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,700
Got used to my bed.
This ain't going to be like home.

289
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,200
That ain't the only thing I'll miss.

290
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,700
Hell, I'm sorry.

291
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,800
Don't fret it. It ain't nothing.

292
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,500
She don't like it much...

293
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,400
...you riding off with me.

294
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,200
Gave me the evil eye.

295
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,300
You know, Sally's Indian and...

296
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,000
...Indians ain't over-friendly.

297
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,600
I don't blame her.

298
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,900
I won't hold it against her.

299
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,900
She knew me back then.

300
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,800
She knew what a...

301
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,700
...no-good son-of-a-bitch I was.

302
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,000
She ain't allowing that I changed.

303
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,500
She don't realize I
ain't like that no more.

304
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,900
- You know women.
- I ain't the same, Ned.

305
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,000
Claudia straightened me up.
Cleared me of drinking whiskey and all.

306
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,800
Going on this killing...

307
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,800
...don't mean I'll go
back to the way I was.

308
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,000
Just need the money.

309
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,800
Get a new start for them youngsters.

310
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,500
Remember that drover
I shot in the mouth...

311
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,300
...and his teeth came
out the back of his head?

312
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,400
I think about him now and again.

313
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,100
He didn't do anything
to deserve to get shot.

314
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,700
At least nothing I remembered
when I sobered up.

315
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,200
You was one crazy son-of-a-bitch.

316
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,900
No one liked me.

317
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,800
The boys all thought I'd shoot
them out of pure meanness.

318
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,100
You ain't like that no more.

319
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,000
Eagle, he hated my guts.

320
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,200
Bonaparte didn't think too much of me.

321
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,400
Quincy neither, I reckon.

322
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,700
Quincy used to just watch all the time.

323
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,400
Scared.

324
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,900
Like I said...

325
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,300
...you ain't like that no more.

326
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,500
That's right.

327
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
I'm just a fellow now.

328
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,800
I ain't no different than anyone else.

329
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,700
No more.

330
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,200
What son-of-a-bitch shot him?

331
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,900
Was it one of them John Bulls?

332
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,500
No, sir.

333
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,000
The would-be assassin is a gentleman
of French ancestry. Or so it seems.

334
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,600
I don't wish to give offense, but...

335
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,900
...the French are known to
be a race of assassins...

336
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
...who can't shoot worth a damn.

337
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,600
Any Frenchmen present
are excluded, of course.

338
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,500
Says here a fellow by
the name of Guiteau.

339
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,700
Sure as hell sounds
like a John Bull to me.

340
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,600
Again, I don't wish to give offense...

341
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,900
...when I suggest that
this country select...

342
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,400
...a king or even a queen,
rather than a President.

343
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
One isn't that quick to
shoot a king or a queen.

344
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,700
The majesty of royalty, you see.

345
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Maybe you don't wish to
give offense, sir...

346
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,900
...but you are giving it pretty thick.

347
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,800
This country don't need
no queens whatsoever.

348
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,700
- When I heard about queens--
- Shut up, Joe.

349
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,500
What's wrong with you? This dude--

350
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Might be this dude here is English Bob.

351
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,400
Works for the railroad
shooting Chinamen.

352
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,200
Might be waiting for some cowboy...

353
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,200
...to touch his pistol
so he can shoot him.

354
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,200
Is that a fact, mister?

355
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,900
You English Bob?

356
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,300
Pheasants.

357
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,600
Let's shoot some pheasants.

358
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,000
Ten shots.

359
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,000
And let's say $1 a pheasant.

360
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,600
I'll shoot for the Queen, and you for...

361
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,500
...whomever.

362
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,300
That's 8 for me and 1 for you.

363
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,000
That comes to 7 American dollars.

364
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,500
Pretty damn good shooting...

365
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,700
...for a John Bull.

366
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,900
No doubt your aim was
affected by your grief...

367
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,600
...over the injury to your President.

368
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:27,300
It's the climate that does it.
That, and the infernal distances.

369
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,400
Does what?

370
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,900
Induces people to shoot
persons in high places.

371
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,300
It's a savage country, really.

372
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,400
That's the second one
they shot in 20 years.

373
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,200
It's uncivilized shooting
persons of substance.

374
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,100
Thank you.

375
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,200
Pardon me, gentlemen.

376
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,900
The law obliges you to
surrender all sidearms...

377
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,600
...to the proper authorities
during your visit.

378
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,700
Proper authority?

379
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,300
I can assure you...

380
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,000
...that neither my companion or
I carry firearms on our person.

381
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,200
We rely upon the goodwill of
our fellow man and the...

382
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,800
...forbearance of reptiles.

383
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,600
Unarmed, my ass.

384
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,900
Christ, it's hot.

385
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:29,300
If I'm going to get shot, I'd
rather it was hot than cold.

386
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,700
Everything hurts me more when it's cold.

387
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,100
- If you hit your thumb--
- Shut up, Fatty!

388
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,300
- I only said--
- Clyde's back.

389
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,500
- With Little Bill?
- No.

390
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,300
Shit.

391
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,300
- You clean my Remington?
- Cleaned and loaded.

392
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Where's Little Bill, for chrissake?

393
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,200
Building his damn porch.

394
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,200
Building his porch?

395
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,000
If you got shot, would you want
it to be a hot or cold day?

396
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,900
I ain't going to get shot.

397
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,800
He's coming?

398
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
Of course he's coming.

399
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,600
I just loaded that.

400
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,900
I don't trust nobody to load
my guns for a shooting.

401
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
What he say?

402
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,600
Little Bill said he
was building his porch.

403
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,900
You seen that thing?

404
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,700
It was all loaded.

405
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,600
You got three pistols
and you only got one arm!

406
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,100
I don't want to get killed
for lack of shooting back.

407
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,700
He don't have a straight
angle on that whole porch!

408
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,100
Or the whole house, for that matter!

409
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,500
He is the worst damn carpenter.

410
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,700
He didn't say nothing?

411
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
Asked what they looked like.

412
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,600
Maybe he's tough but he
sure ain't no carpenter.

413
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,800
Maybe he ain't so tough.

414
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,600
Seem like he was scared?

415
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,300
Little Bill? Him scared?

416
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,700
We never seen him up
against any like these ones.

417
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,700
Killers.

418
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,200
Little Bill come out of
Kansas and Texas, boys.

419
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,800
He worked them tough towns.

420
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,400
Just wondered.

421
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,100
Anybody could be scared.

422
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,900
He wasn't scared, boys.

423
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,700
He just ain't no carpenter.

424
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,400
There's a dignity in royalty which
precludes the likelihood of assassination.

425
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,400
If you pointed a pistol at a queen...

426
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,100
...your hands would shake as if palsied.

427
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,500
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody.

428
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,700
Always a wise policy.

429
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,000
But if you did, I can assure you...

430
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,600
...the sight of royalty would cause you
to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed.

431
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,300
You would stand, how should I put it...

432
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,600
...in awe.

433
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,100
Now, a President....

434
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,200
Well, why not shoot the President?

435
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,300
Keep the change.

436
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,300
This Strawberry Alice
person, tell me again.

437
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,100
Down the street to Greely's Beer
Garden and Billiards Parlor.

438
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,700
Say you want a game of billiards.

439
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,800
Billiards?

440
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,200
Even though I don't wish to play?

441
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,700
No matter. They burned the
table in '78 for firewood.

442
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,600
Right.

443
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,900
Quite right.

444
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,000
Mr. Beauchamp, I think a cup of tea--

445
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,600
Hello, Bob.

446
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,700
Boys, this here is English Bob.

447
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,900
Shit and fried eggs.

448
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,800
Been a long time.

449
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,400
Run out of Chinamen?

450
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,900
I thought that you were dead.

451
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,300
You've shaved your chin whiskers off.

452
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,100
I was tasting the soup
two hours after I ate it.

453
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,900
Actually, what I heard was you...

454
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,900
...fell off your horse.
Drunk, of course.

455
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,700
And that you broke your bloody neck.

456
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,000
I heard that one myself, Bob.

457
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
Hell, I even thought I was dead.

458
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,000
Till I found out I was just in Nebraska.

459
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,500
Who's he?

460
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,400
W.W. Beauchamp.

461
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,100
This is Little Bill Daggett.

462
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,000
And friends, of course.

463
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,300
From Newton, Hays? From Abilene?

464
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,500
In person.

465
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,300
You work for the railroads too?

466
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,300
I write.

467
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,300
Letters?

468
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,400
Books, Bill. Books.

469
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,500
Actually...

470
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
...he's my biographer.

471
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,300
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

472
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,200
It's only a book.

473
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,700
A book?

474
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,400
That means you boys can read.

475
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,600
That means you saw the signs...

476
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,800
...saying surrender your firearms.

477
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,900
But like you told young Andy...

478
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,200
...you're not armed, are you?

479
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,300
Not really, Bill.

480
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,200
Got a Peacemaker, but that
wouldn't worry you, would it?

481
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,900
If you don't see it.
Or better, if you don't hear it.

482
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,600
I'm afraid so, Bob.

483
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
I don't like firearms around.

484
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,100
Be very careful with it, sonny.

485
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,100
See what kind of books
Mr. Beauchamp is packing.

486
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400
Make sure you don't get wet.

487
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,200
No shit.

488
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,400
All he's got is writing
stuff and this book.

489
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,800
"The Duck of Death?"

490
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,000
Duke.

491
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,400
"The Duke."

492
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,300
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

493
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,400
I'll have that.32, Bob.

494
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,600
Now, Little Bill.

495
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,500
You will leave me at
the mercy of my enemies.

496
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,500
Enemies?

497
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,300
You been talking about the Queen again?

498
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,900
On Independence Day?

499
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,900
I guess you think I'm kicking you.

500
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,000
But it ain't so!

501
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,200
What I'm doing is talking!

502
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,200
Hear?!

503
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,200
Talking to all them villains in Kansas!

504
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,900
To all those villains in Missouri!

505
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,400
And those villains...

506
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,500
...down in Cheyenne!

507
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,600
I'm saying there ain't no whore's gold!

508
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,000
Even if there was, they
don't want to come for it...

509
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,100
...anyhow!

510
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,700
What are you looking at?!

511
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,000
Go on!

512
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Mind your own business!

513
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,100
Ever go into town?

514
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,600
On occasion.

515
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,200
To sell a hog, pick up supplies.

516
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,600
I mean, get yourself a woman.

517
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,000
No, I never go into town for that.

518
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,900
A man like me?

519
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,400
Only woman I could get is
one I'd have to pay for.

520
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,500
That ain't right, buying flesh.

521
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,900
Claudia, rest her soul,
wouldn't want me doing that.

522
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,700
Me being a father, and all.

523
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,100
You just use your hand?

524
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,200
I don't miss it all that much.

525
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,500
Goddamn, somebody's shooting at us!

526
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,100
You hit?

527
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,900
I bumped my head falling off my horse.

528
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,700
Ain't shooting at us no more.

529
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,700
Shooting way over yonder.

530
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,000
What the hell's he shooting at?

531
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,200
Beats the hell out of me.

532
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,400
Reckon we in somebody's field?

533
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,400
I didn't see nothing planted.

534
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,800
Shooting at us again.

535
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,500
He's shooting at the whole horizon.

536
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,300
Wait! You'll mark us!

537
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,700
Hey, Kid!

538
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,600
That's the Kid shooting at us?

539
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,500
Kid, it's me! Will Munny!

540
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,000
What the hell's he shooting at us for?

541
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,300
That you?

542
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,300
Yeah, it's me!

543
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,800
Don't go shooting at us
no more! You hear me?

544
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,700
Who the hell you got with you, Will?

545
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,000
It's Ned Logan, my old partner!

546
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,600
Don't go shooting at us, you hear?

547
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,200
We'll get our horses
and come on over there.

548
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,500
You ain't going to shoot, are you?

549
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,900
I ain't!

550
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,200
Chased that horse a damn mile.

551
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,900
- What was you shooting at us for?
- I thought you was following me.

552
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,700
We was. You said if I changed my mind--

553
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,400
Wasn't nothing said about no partner.

554
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,800
This here's Ned Logan.

555
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,200
He's the Schofield Kid,
nephew to Pete Sothow.

556
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,300
I seen two fellows following me.
My guess is you come to kill me.

557
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,800
We never talked about no other fellow.

558
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,500
There's two cowboys. Better there's
three of us, if they got friends.

559
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,500
I can take care of them two myself.
It don't take three.

560
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,300
Ned's an awful good shot with a rifle.
Hit a bird in the eye flying.

561
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,600
Better than you, anyhow.

562
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,900
- You wasn't even coming close.
- Hands off!

563
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,700
Thought I'd check it for you.
Maybe something's bent.

564
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,200
It ain't... bent.

565
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,200
You were shooting all over creation!

566
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,800
You'll share your half with him?

567
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,200
I figure three ways.

568
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,500
Wrong.

569
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,400
Sorry I wasted your time, Ned.

570
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,500
You going back with him?

571
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,100
He's my partner.

572
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,300
He don't go, I don't.

573
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,100
What's it come to, three ways?

574
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,000
Shit!

575
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,500
What are you pissing on about?

576
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,700
What are you looking at?

577
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,100
Looking at?

578
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,500
Clouds.

579
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,700
He's looking at them clouds on
account of we got a storm coming.

580
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,100
I seen them.

581
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,600
You was smart to change your mind.

582
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,800
I'm a real good shot with this rifle.

583
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,700
See that hawk?

584
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,600
I could hit it with one shot.

585
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,400
Hell, I could hit it too.
If I didn't mind wasting a shot.

586
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,600
There ain't no hawk, Kid.

587
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,500
You can't see for shit, can you?

588
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,300
See your canteen?

589
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,000
How far can you see?

590
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Far enough.

591
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:06,300
- We ain't going to shoot canteens!
- How far? 100 yards?

592
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,400
More.

593
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,800
- See that scrub oak tree yonder?
- Fuck you.

594
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,900
- He's blind, Will!
- I ain't blind, you asshole!

595
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,700
Hold it!

596
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,000
How far can you see, Kid? 50 yards?

597
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,200
You bet your ass I can
see 50 yards, Will.

598
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,900
I can see well enough to
shoot this son-of-a-bitch.

599
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,300
Hold on.

600
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,200
Hear that, Ned?

601
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,800
Kid can see 50 yards. Fine.

602
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,400
Jesus.

603
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,400
Fifty yards'll do just fine.
Now let's move out.

604
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,000
They look like real hard cases, Bob.

605
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,200
Did you kill all 7 of them?

606
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,200
Or just wing some of them?

607
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,500
That you here embalmed on the cover?

608
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,700
"The Duck of Death?"

609
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,700
The Duke.

610
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,000
"The Duke of Death."

611
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:21,600
You always were good with a
pistol, but 7 of them? Boy!

612
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,600
Protecting that woman.
How the hell do you do that?

613
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,700
It's desirable in the publishing
business to take a certain...

614
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,400
...Iiberty when depicting
the cover scene.

615
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,600
For reasons involving the marketplace.

616
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:42,300
From what I read, the writing's not
that much different than the picture.

617
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,700
I can assure you, Mr. Daggett...

618
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,700
...that the events described are
taken from eyewitness accounts.

619
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,700
- Eyewitnesses?
- Yes, sir.

620
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,200
Like the Duck himself, I guess.

621
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,600
The Duke.

622
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,300
Duck, I says.

623
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,500
"'You have insulted the honor of
this beautiful woman, Corcoran'...

624
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,800
...said the Duck.

625
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,100
'You must apologize.'

626
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,800
But Two-Gun Corcoran
would none of it.

627
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,400
Cursing, he reached for his
pistols and would have killed him...

628
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,000
...but the Duck was faster and hot
lead blazed from his smoking six-guns."

629
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:32,200
I consider that an accurate
depiction of events.

630
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,700
There is a certain poetry to the
language which I couldn't resist.

631
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,800
I was in the Blue Bottle
Saloon in Wichita...

632
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,900
...the night English Bob
killed Corky Corcoran.

633
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,200
I didn't see you there...

634
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,500
...nor no woman...

635
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,700
...nor two-gun shooters.

636
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,400
Nor none of this.

637
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,600
- You were there?
- Yeah, I was there.

638
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,100
First off...

639
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,200
...Corky never carried two
guns, though he should have.

640
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,400
He was called Two-Gun Corcoran.

641
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,600
A lot of folks did call him Two-Gun.

642
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,000
But not because he had two pistols.

643
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,600
He had a dick that was so big...

644
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,600
...it was longer than the
barrel on his Walker Colt.

645
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:21,300
The only insulting he did
was stick that thing...

646
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,700
...into a French lady
English Bob was sweet on.

647
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,100
The night Corky walked
into the Blue Bottle...

648
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:32,000
...before he knows what's what,
Bob takes a shot at him!

649
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,800
And misses, he's so damn drunk.

650
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:38,100
That bullet whizzing by panicked
Corky, and he did the wrong thing.

651
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,100
In his hurry, he shot his damn toe off.

652
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,800
Meantime, Bob here...

653
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,200
...aims real good and
squeezes off another...

654
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,600
...but he misses, he's still so drunk!

655
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,500
He hits this thousand-dollar
mirror over the bar.

656
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,300
The Duck of Death is as good as dead...

657
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,000
...because Corky does it right.

658
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,200
He aims real careful.

659
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,900
No hurry....

660
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,000
The Walker Colt blew up in his hand...

661
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,600
...a failing common to that model.

662
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,500
If Corky'd had two guns
instead of just a big dick...

663
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,300
...he'd have defended
himself to the end.

664
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,000
Wait a minute.

665
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:24,700
English Bob killed him when
he didn't even have....

666
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,300
Bob wasn't going to wait for
Corky to grow a new hand.

667
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,700
No, he just walked over
there real slow...

668
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,100
...'cause he's drunk...

669
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,400
...and shot him through the liver.

670
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,500
I don't like rocks on my dad-gum back.

671
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,600
- I sure do miss my bed.
- You said that last night.

672
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:09,500
Last night I said I missed my wife.
Tonight I just miss my dad-gum bed!

673
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,600
You'll miss your dad-gum
roof next, I suppose.

674
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,500
Will?

675
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,900
That business up in Jackson County...

676
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,400
...that really happen?

677
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,700
The way they say it happened?

678
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,600
What business?

679
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,900
Two deputies up close pointing
their rifles right at you.

680
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,700
Got you dead to rights.

681
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,800
You pulled out your pistol
and blew them to hell.

682
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,200
Only took a scratch yourself.

683
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:03,400
Uncle Pete never seen nothing like you
shooting your way out of that scrape.

684
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,900
Well, I don't recollect.

685
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,900
You don't recollect?

686
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,800
Right.

687
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,700
Ned...

688
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,400
...how many men you killed?

689
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,800
Ain't you going to answer?

690
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,000
What the hell's that to you?

691
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:40,500
I got to know what kind of fellow I'm
riding with, case we get into a scrape.

692
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,600
How many men you killed, Kid?

693
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,100
Five.

694
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,300
How many?

695
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:51,900
Five.

696
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,900
I done killed 5 of them.

697
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,900
That's including a Mexican
who come at me with a knife.

698
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,600
Why don't you shut up? Get some rest.

699
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:06,900
You boys're as crotchety
as a couple of old hens.

700
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,700
Actually...

701
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,600
...Mr. Corcoran was faster
on the draw than the Duck--

702
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,500
Than English Bob?

703
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,500
Faster?

704
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,400
Faster was his mistake.

705
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:23,000
If he hadn't rushed, he wouldn't
have shot himself in the toe.

706
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,800
He would've killed old Bob.

707
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,100
Being a good shot and being
quick with a pistol...

708
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:35,700
...don't do no harm, but it don't
mean much next to being cool-headed.

709
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:40,000
A man who'll keep his head,
not get rattled under fire...

710
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,000
...Iike as not will kill you.

711
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,300
But if the other fellow is quicker--

712
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,900
Then he'll hurry and he'll miss.

713
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,200
Look.

714
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:55,700
That's as fast as I can draw, aim and
hit anything more than 10 feet away.

715
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,800
'Less it's a barn.

716
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,300
But if he doesn't miss?

717
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,200
He'll kill you.

718
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,700
That's why there's so few
dangerous men around like Bob.

719
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:12,700
Like me.

720
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,400
It ain't so easy to shoot a
man if he's shooting back.

721
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,400
That'll flat rattle some folks.

722
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,400
- I'll show you something.
- Wait.

723
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,500
Look.

724
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,100
Take that.

725
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,400
Take it.

726
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,200
There's the key.

727
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,600
Just shoot me...

728
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:43,100
...and you and Bob can ride
on out of here free as birds.

729
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:52,600
- Is it loaded?
- Wouldn't do any good if it wasn't.

730
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,300
You got to cock it.

731
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,400
Cock it.

732
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,400
Point it.

733
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,900
Go on. Point it.

734
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,600
Now all you must do
is pull the trigger.

735
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,700
Hot, ain't it?

736
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,400
Your finger wasn't even on the trigger.

737
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,900
What if....

738
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:53,800
What if I gave it to him?

739
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,500
Do it.

740
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,700
You don't--

741
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,000
Do it.

742
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,400
I guess he don't want it, Mr. Beauchamp.

743
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,400
You were right not to take it.

744
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,100
I'd have killed you.

745
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,500
We could use some rain.

746
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,400
You no-good goddamn
pig-fucking whore!

747
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,300
Sorry, horse.

748
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:23,200
I brung this for when
we kill them fellows.

749
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,200
Figured we could use some now.

750
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,000
Not me. I don't touch it no more.

751
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,600
It's raining.

752
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,700
I know it's raining!
Give some to the Kid.

753
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,600
You think that Kid really killed 5 men?

754
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,900
When you talked about the time them
deputies had the drop on you and Pete....

755
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I remember there was
3 men you shot, not 2.

756
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,900
I ain't like that no more, Ned!

757
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,500
I ain't no crazy killing fool.

758
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,900
Still think it'll be easy
to kill them cowboys?

759
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,100
If we don't drown first.

760
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:21,100
Give these keys to the conductor.

761
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,300
He can loose Bob's cuffs as soon
as he's outside the county.

762
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,100
Got my pistols?

763
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,500
I guess you know, Bob, that...

764
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:36,100
...if I see you again I'll
just shoot in self-defense.

765
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,400
I didn't steal your biographer!

766
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,700
He's staying on his own account!

767
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:52,000
He can go stuff himself
as well, can't he?!

768
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:55,200
A plague on the whole
stinking lot of you!

769
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,500
Without morals or laws!

770
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:01,500
And all you whores!
You got no laws and no honor!

771
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:05,200
It's no wonder you all
emigrated to America!

772
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,900
They wouldn't have you in England!

773
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,300
You're a lot of savages!

774
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:14,700
You're all a bunch of bloody
savages! A curse on you!

775
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,600
Nobody's going to come...

776
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:22,500
...after what Little Bill
done to that Englishman.

777
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:27,000
Delilah, can't you
get them tables clean?

778
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:31,900
Cover your face, somebody might hump
you and you wouldn't have to clean.

779
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,700
What do they call that face cover?

780
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:36,900
A veil.

781
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,700
Yeah. Get a veil!

782
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,300
Rain's coming.

783
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,400
Thank God.

784
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:17,000
Sure?

785
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,400
You all right, Will?

786
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,900
Fellow asking for Alice.

787
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,400
Tonight? You ain't joshing?

788
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,900
This way, mister.

789
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:50,100
Must be randy as hell to
come out in this shit.

790
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,700
"No, no! You're wrong,
Little Bill!" he said.

791
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,900
"That's not the Curly J.
That's a Bobbed J!"

792
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,300
He had changed it over.
And I said to him...

793
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,500
..."Jim, you're a liar
and a horse thief!"

794
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,700
He saw nobody would help him none.

795
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,700
He went to start crying and
sobbing and just carrying on.

796
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:24,200
He said, "God, please,
don't kill me, Bill!

797
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:25,600
Please don't kill me!"

798
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,700
I said, "It makes me sick--"

799
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,200
Open the window.

800
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:34,100
"--to see a man carrying two
pistols and a Henry rifle...

801
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,900
...and crying like a damn baby."

802
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,700
So... you killed him?

803
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,800
No.

804
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,700
But I should have.

805
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,600
I can't abide them kind.

806
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,800
You see them in the taverns.

807
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,400
Tramps and drunk teamsters.

808
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,500
Crazed miners.

809
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:55,600
Sporting their pistols and
acting like they was bad men.

810
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:59,800
But without any sand or character.
Not even any bad character.

811
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,500
I do not like assassins.

812
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,900
Or men of low character.

813
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,100
Like English Bob.

814
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,600
But Bob was no coward, you know.

815
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
He wouldn't cry and carry on like that--

816
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,300
Sheriff....

817
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:24,200
I don't have any more receptacles.

818
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,500
Maybe you should just
hang the carpenter.

819
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:35,000
I meant that because of
the--if you hang....

820
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,300
Never mind.

821
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,100
What the hell?

822
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,500
On a night like this!

823
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,200
Who is it?

824
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,500
Deputy Charley Hecker, Bill.

825
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,500
Three fellows just come into town, Bill.
They're down to Greely's.

826
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,400
There's two of them got guns.

827
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,600
What the hell's keeping that Kid?

828
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:12,900
You suppose he's up--

829
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,700
You look like shit.

830
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,500
You remember Eagle Hendershot?

831
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,500
I saw him.

832
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:33,600
Will, he's dead.

833
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,000
No, I saw him, Ned.

834
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:40,200
His head was broke open.
You could see inside of it.

835
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:42,800
Jesus.

836
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,600
You got a fever.

837
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:47,800
- Take your drink.
- Worms were coming out.

838
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,200
I'll go find the Kid.

839
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:57,800
Must be he's getting an advance
on one of the sporting ladies.

840
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,300
If I was to....

841
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,400
If it worked out that I could...

842
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,600
...take a little time
for myself, would you--

843
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,100
I guess you don't want to come.

844
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,100
Give me the pistol.

845
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,100
I says give me over your pistol.

846
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,000
I ain't drunk.

847
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,700
Ordinance says you got to turn
in your firearms to my office...

848
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,700
...day or night.

849
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:08,500
I guess you didn't see the sign,
because of the weather.

850
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,400
No.

851
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:15,300
But I ain't armed.

852
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,900
Your friends upstairs got any pistols?

853
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,900
They ain't armed either.

854
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,500
Spilled your whiskey.

855
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,800
What's your name?

856
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:36,900
William...

857
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:40,700
...Hendershot.

858
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:46,600
Well, Mr. William Hendershot...

859
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,900
...what if I was to say
you was a no-good liar?

860
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:59,100
And if I was to say you shit in your
pants because of a cowardly soul...

861
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,400
...I bet you'd show me that pistol
right quick and shoot me dead.

862
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,700
Is that so?

863
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,200
Maybe, I guess.

864
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:16,400
But the fact...

865
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,400
...is I ain't...

866
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,200
...carrying no firearm.

867
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,600
Get up.

868
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,600
What's this for, snakes and such?

869
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,700
We don't have any snakes
in here, Mr. Hendershot.

870
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:07,100
It ain't loaded.

871
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:09,800
Powder's wet.

872
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:14,600
You see, Mr. Beauchamp?

873
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:19,400
Such is the trash I spoke of!

874
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,800
They're in all the saloons...

875
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,100
...in all your prosperous communities!

876
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,400
Wichita!

877
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,200
Over in Cheyenne!

878
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,700
Abilene!

879
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,600
But not in the town of Big Whiskey.

880
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:53,500
Hurry!

881
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,300
Know what to tell Little Bill?

882
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,800
Look sharp for that lone pine.

883
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,300
Don't miss it.

884
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,400
Not the shirt! Put his boots on!

885
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:13,500
What are we going to do about Will?

886
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:17,000
Come on! Let's hope them
horses are still there!

887
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,800
Let the man out, W.W.

888
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:56,800
He's desiring to leave the
hospitality of Big Whiskey behind him.

889
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,600
Easy. She's got to be able
to turn a dollar a time!

890
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:34,300
How come they lit out the back window?

891
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,100
They seen you beating on their friend.

892
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:39,900
They just come for
the billiards, honest.

893
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:40,900
Billiards?!

894
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,200
They just passing through here?

895
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:46,900
Going to Fort Buford.

896
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:49,900
You kicked the shit
out of an innocent man.

897
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,400
Innocent?

898
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,300
Innocent of what?

899
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,900
You done this before?

900
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,800
Plenty of times.

901
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,400
His pistol must've jammed.

902
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,800
Bring that candle in closer.

903
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:35,100
I can't see.

904
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:49,100
He wouldn't take no beating
if it hadn't jammed.

905
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:52,800
He wouldn't give it over and not shoot.

906
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:58,500
He don't look so good.

907
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,300
He didn't even pull his pistol?

908
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,400
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.

909
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,300
I'd have pulled my pistol.

910
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:07,500
You did!

911
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,500
Out of the lady and out the window!

912
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:12,500
- That was your idea! I wanted to--
- We must go.

913
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:15,900
Already? Darling, I'm
ready for another advance.

914
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:19,400
- You'll use it all up.
- No more advances on what you ain't done.

915
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:23,700
Sweetheart, we're just waiting
on this weather to clear!

916
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,700
We'll need more food!

917
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:27,800
3 days' worth.

918
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,700
3 days?

919
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:33,800
- We'll kill them tomorrow.
- I don't kill nobody without him.

920
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:36,400
We don't need him! We can do it.

921
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,700
He ain't nothing but a
broken-down pig farmer.

922
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:44,700
One of us'll bring food and
some whiskey in the morning!

923
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,900
And some medicine if you got any!

924
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,600
Don't it make you sick hearing him?

925
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,500
Don't you ladies worry!

926
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:57,000
Me and Ned will kill them two
sons-of-bitches for you!

927
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,000
Claudia.

928
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,600
She's not here.

929
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,400
Is that you, Ned?

930
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,400
I've seen him.

931
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,500
I saw the Angel of Death.

932
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,600
I've seen the river, Ned.

933
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:29,900
He's got snake eyes.

934
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,100
Who's got snake eyes?

935
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,900
It's the Angel of Death.

936
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,700
Ned, I'm scared of dying.

937
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:42,800
Easy, partner.

938
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,400
I seen Claudia too.

939
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:49,400
That's good you saw Claudia, ain't it?

940
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,300
Her face was all covered with worms.

941
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,400
Ned, I'm scared.

942
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:57,200
I'm dying.

943
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:04,000
No, don't tell nobody.

944
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,300
Don't tell my kids...

945
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,300
...none of the things I did. Hear me?

946
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:12,400
All right.

947
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,900
He's gonna die, ain't he?

948
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,200
Maybe.

949
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Suppose he does?

950
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,000
We'll bury him.

951
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,400
That ain't what I mean.

952
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:49,300
You mean will I help
you kill them cowboys?

953
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:53,200
I can't spot them myself.

954
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,000
But you could.

955
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,300
You could spot that big
bastard a half-mile off.

956
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:02,300
And if I spot him?

957
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,900
Then I ride up close and shoot him.

958
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,200
Just like that?

959
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,100
I'm a damn killer. I done it before.

960
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:18,200
I'm more of a killer than he is.

961
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,500
I thought you was an angel.

962
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:51,900
You ain't dead.

963
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,500
Some big fellow...

964
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,600
...kicked the hell out of me.

965
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,500
I must look like you now.

966
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:13,700
You don't look nothing like me.

967
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,100
No offense meant.

968
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:22,100
It was you those cowboys cut up.

969
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:31,400
My partners, Ned and that Kid...

970
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:32,800
...they around?

971
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:37,300
They went out scouting
when your fever broke.

972
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,100
Scouting?

973
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,900
Out to the Bar T...

974
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:44,100
...Iooking for them.

975
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:49,800
How long I been here?

976
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:52,200
Three days.

977
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:55,300
Are you hungry or....

978
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,700
Three days?

979
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,400
I should be.

980
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:13,000
I thought I was gone.

981
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:20,100
I wouldn't normally pay no notice
to high country like this.

982
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:23,200
Trees. But I'm sure noticing now.

983
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,100
Thought I was dying for sure.

984
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:29,800
I brought your hat.

985
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,400
You left it down at Greely's.

986
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:34,300
Thanks.

987
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:37,500
That sheriff...

988
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:40,200
...still looking for me?

989
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:41,600
Little Bill?

990
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:44,400
No, he thinks you went south.

991
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:50,100
Are you really going
to kill them cowboys?

992
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:52,600
I guess.

993
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,500
Still a payment coming, isn't there?

994
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,500
The other two, your friends...

995
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:03,200
...they're taking
advances on the payment.

996
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,500
Advances?

997
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:08,900
Free ones.

998
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:14,000
Alice and Silky been
giving them free ones.

999
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:17,000
I see.

1000
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,600
Would you like a free one?

1001
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,500
I guess not.

1002
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:37,600
I didn't mean with me. I meant...

1003
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:41,000
...Alice and Silky would
give you a free one...

1004
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,600
...if you wanted.

1005
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,100
That's all I meant.

1006
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:52,800
I didn't mean I didn't want a
free one because you been cut up.

1007
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,300
What I said about you
looking like me ain't true.

1008
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,700
You ain't ugly like me.

1009
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:03,700
It's just that we both have scars.

1010
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:10,000
You're a beautiful woman and
if I wanted a free one...

1011
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:13,600
...I'd want it with you
more than the other two.

1012
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:17,100
It's just that...

1013
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,200
...I can't on account of my wife.

1014
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:27,700
Your wife?

1015
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,200
I admire you for that...

1016
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,400
...being true to your wife.

1017
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,100
I've known a lot of men...

1018
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,700
...who weren't.

1019
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:51,500
I suppose.

1020
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,400
Is she back in Kansas?

1021
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,900
She's watching over my young ones.

1022
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:11,900
Hang on!

1023
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Get the damn iron!

1024
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,700
Jesus, boys, my leg's broke!

1025
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,300
I'm pinned, boys!

1026
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,900
Better finish him.

1027
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,600
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?

1028
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,400
He got the boy's horse.

1029
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:52,500
Finish him before he gets clear.

1030
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:57,000
Get behind them rocks.

1031
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,000
Get over there!

1032
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:04,800
What happened?
He ain't killed?!

1033
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:06,200
What's going on?

1034
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,900
He gets in those rocks,
we won't get him.

1035
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:11,600
- Unless we go down there.
- What rocks?

1036
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:14,700
Why don't you shoot?
What's going on?

1037
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,400
Shoot!

1038
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:35,600
I ain't very good with one of these.

1039
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,400
Keep going, Davey! The rocks!

1040
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:46,700
Get him?

1041
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:48,900
Where is he?

1042
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,300
How many more shots do I have?

1043
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,900
How many more shots do I have?

1044
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,200
Two.

1045
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:12,800
Did you get him?

1046
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,500
Here, reload this.

1047
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,800
- You missed him.
- I got him.

1048
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:39,900
He ain't killed.

1049
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,300
Maybe, maybe not.

1050
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:44,900
Got him through the gut, I think.

1051
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:50,800
Think he'll die?

1052
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,300
We killed him?

1053
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:05,900
We killed him...

1054
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:07,400
...I guess.

1055
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,200
I'm dying, boys!

1056
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,300
Then you shouldn't have cut
up no woman, you asshole!

1057
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:24,900
Jesus, I'm so thirsty.

1058
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,100
Give me some water, please!

1059
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:32,600
Please, Slim!

1060
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:35,400
I'm bleeding, Slim!

1061
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:42,200
Give him a drink of water, goddamn it!

1062
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:50,000
Give him some water, for chrissake!
We ain't going to shoot!

1063
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,200
You won't?

1064
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,700
Hold on, Davey-boy!

1065
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,300
Here I come now!

1066
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,500
Don't shoot, you bastards!

1067
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:14,200
Shit!

1068
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,000
They take him water?

1069
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:30,000
Jesus, Johnny! They shot him!

1070
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:31,700
Hold on now!

1071
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,600
You murdering bastards!
You killed our Davey-boy!

1072
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,900
When do we double back?

1073
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,300
After a ways.

1074
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:58,700
Not me.

1075
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,700
I'm heading back down to Kansas.

1076
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:03,900
We must kill the other one first.

1077
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:09,000
With any luck, we'll find him
by nightfall or in the morning.

1078
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,700
We'll shoot him and head
back with the money.

1079
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:15,300
Want the Spencer?

1080
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:17,200
It's no time to quit.

1081
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,400
- You'll lose your share.
- Shut up!

1082
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:22,300
I'll see you, Will. So long, Kid.

1083
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,800
I ain't no good with that damn thing.

1084
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:39,100
Me and the Kid'll go over to that ranch
and when we find him we'll shoot him.

1085
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:42,900
We'll meet up with you, get our
money, and head south together.

1086
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,900
Suppose he don't go back to the ranch?

1087
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:50,200
He ain't going into town.
He won't stay out in the open country.

1088
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,500
He'll hole up at that ranch.

1089
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,600
I ain't waiting.

1090
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,700
I'll look in on your young ones.

1091
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:07,800
Forget what the Kid said
about the money and all.

1092
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,100
I'll bring yours.

1093
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:14,800
Kid's full of shit.

1094
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:44,000
Doing some repairs up here.

1095
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,100
They killed one of them cowboys.

1096
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:51,200
Shit.

1097
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:56,900
Parsons said he saw three men,
right after sun-up, headed east.

1098
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:01,600
One was on a dun and another
was on a flea-bitten grey.

1099
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,000
He didn't know what the third
one was on, maybe an Appaloosa.

1100
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:10,500
Amos says to ask if the county will
pay for feed for all the horses.

1101
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:14,000
Witherspoon won't sell us no more
.30-30 shells without we pay.

1102
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,500
Use my dogs.

1103
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:18,000
Then the county must
take responsibility.

1104
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:23,100
Fatty, get on out there to the Bar
T and make sure that other cowboy...

1105
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,800
...stays put and don't expose himself.

1106
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:37,700
I didn't think they'd really do it.

1107
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Think they come clear
from Kansas to fuck us?

1108
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:47,200
But that Kid's just a
boy and the other one...

1109
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:50,600
...Will, the nice one, being
so true to his wife....

1110
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:53,200
Wife? He ain't got no wife.

1111
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:56,500
- Yes, he does. He said--
- He ain't got no wife.

1112
01:33:56,700 --> 01:33:58,700
Not above ground, anyways.

1113
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,900
Murdering whores!

1114
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:08,500
He had it coming...

1115
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:10,300
...for what he done.

1116
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:11,900
And the other one too!

1117
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:14,300
Both of them for what they done!

1118
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:25,400
We got one!

1119
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,300
We got one, Sheriff! Out by Cow Creek!

1120
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,800
Is he alive?

1121
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:35,300
Yeah! Bunch of us from
Bar T went out looking...

1122
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:37,600
...'cause they killed one of our own.

1123
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:41,000
Come across the bastard
on a roan heading south.

1124
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:42,400
He admit it?

1125
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:46,800
No. But I guess he will soon enough.
Had a Spencer rifle on him.

1126
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:48,800
They messing him up?

1127
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:51,800
Little bit.

1128
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:59,300
Get out there. Find out what
happened to those other two!

1129
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,400
See anything out there, Buck?

1130
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:27,400
Hell, yes! Seen about 200
fellows packing rifles.

1131
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,100
Got the place surrounded.
Say they want Quick Mike's ass.

1132
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:35,100
I said, "How much?" They says,
"Five. " I said, "Dollars?"

1133
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:36,500
They said, "Cents."

1134
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,200
I said, "Sold."

1135
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:41,400
Well, I ain't worried!

1136
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:43,900
'Cause I got me some protection.

1137
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,500
- Tell you where them others is?
- Nope.

1138
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:11,700
Names?

1139
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:14,600
Only told us his name, Ned Roundtree.

1140
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:18,300
Bring him in.

1141
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,900
You'll want to tell me
and Mr. Beauchamp here...

1142
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:26,800
...all about your two
villainous friends.

1143
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:31,500
I'll want the names and whereabouts
of those murderous son-of-a-bitches.

1144
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:47,200
Sure is ripe.

1145
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:50,500
Going to get a lot riper.

1146
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:53,400
Think he's still in there?

1147
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,100
He's in there.

1148
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:00,400
He's holding on to his
shit like it was money.

1149
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,500
He's in there.

1150
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,100
Tell me right off if you see him.

1151
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:09,500
You won't shoot him your own self?

1152
01:37:09,700 --> 01:37:11,300
You can shoot him.

1153
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:52,400
You, Mr. Quincy and...
what was the young fellow's name?

1154
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:58,000
Elroy Tate.

1155
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:05,200
No, that's not what you said.

1156
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:06,600
It is.

1157
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,400
No, you said...

1158
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,700
..."Elroy Quincy out
of Medicine Hat and...

1159
01:38:13,100 --> 01:38:15,100
...Henry Tate out of Cheyenne."

1160
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:17,800
Hell if I did.

1161
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:20,100
Hell if I did.

1162
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:25,500
Go get them whores that
fucked these boys that night.

1163
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,600
Strawberry Alice and Silky?

1164
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,600
Go on and get them!

1165
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:41,500
Them whores will tell
different lies than you.

1166
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:46,400
And when their lies ain't
the same as your lies....

1167
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,600
I ain't going to hurt no woman.

1168
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:53,600
But I will hurt you.

1169
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,000
Not gentle like before...

1170
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:01,100
...but bad.

1171
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,200
Where you going?

1172
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,000
- The shithouse.
- Let me finish this hand.

1173
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
To protect me while I take a dump?

1174
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:25,400
- You'll get bushwhacked.
- I'll fart on them.

1175
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:28,600
- I'll go with him.
- You can wipe my ass, Thirsty.

1176
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:32,100
Hell with him. He ain't
polite, he should get shot.

1177
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:36,900
That him?

1178
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:38,800
Yeah, it's him.

1179
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,900
Go get him. He's all yours.

1180
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:21,400
Assassins!

1181
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:25,900
Shoot!

1182
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:43,100
Come on, goddamn it!

1183
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:00,800
Get him?

1184
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:14,200
Cover me.

1185
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:18,700
- I can't see them!
- Just shoot!

1186
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:30,000
Get him!

1187
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:56,900
Was it like that in the old days?

1188
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,800
Everybody riding out, shooting...

1189
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:04,300
...smoke all over, folks yelling,
bullets whizzing by?

1190
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,400
I guess so.

1191
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:13,800
Shit, I thought they'd get us.

1192
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:16,700
I was even scared a little.

1193
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:18,200
For a minute.

1194
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:22,900
You ever scared in them days?

1195
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:26,300
I can't remember.

1196
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:29,800
I was drunk most of the time.

1197
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,700
I shot that fucker three times!

1198
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:43,000
He went for his pistol
and I blazed away.

1199
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:45,100
First shot...

1200
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:48,600
...I got him right in the chest.

1201
01:42:57,900 --> 01:42:59,400
That was the first.

1202
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,100
First what?

1203
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,300
First one I ever killed.

1204
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,500
I know I said I shot five men.

1205
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,300
It weren't true.

1206
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,700
That Mexican who had a knife...

1207
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:22,800
...I busted his leg with a shovel.

1208
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
I didn't kill him or nothing.

1209
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:31,200
You killed the hell out
of that fellow today.

1210
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:34,600
Hell, yeah!

1211
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,200
I killed the hell out of him!

1212
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,700
Three shots while he took a shit....

1213
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:51,600
Take a drink.

1214
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:17,400
It don't seem real.

1215
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:21,700
How he won't never breathe again, ever.

1216
01:44:22,900 --> 01:44:24,400
How he's dead.

1217
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,600
And the other one too.

1218
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,500
On account of pulling a trigger.

1219
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:37,500
It's a hell of a thing, killing a man.

1220
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:41,400
You take away all he's got...

1221
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,400
...and all he'll ever have.

1222
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:51,600
I guess they had it coming.

1223
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:59,500
We all have it coming, Kid.

1224
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:16,600
I was watching you.
You weren't followed.

1225
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:21,800
Silky and Faith rode off to the east
and two deputies followed them.

1226
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:30,400
Want to help me count this?

1227
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:33,800
- I trust you.
- Don't go trusting me too much.

1228
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:38,400
In fact, we'll give
Ned his share together.

1229
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,900
You'll know I ain't holding out on you.

1230
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:42,500
Ned's share?

1231
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:47,500
He went south. We'll catch up.

1232
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,700
He's dead.

1233
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,600
What do you mean?

1234
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:58,500
He went south yesterday. He ain't dead.

1235
01:45:58,900 --> 01:46:01,500
They killed him. I thought you knew.

1236
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,600
Nobody killed Ned!

1237
01:46:03,700 --> 01:46:06,200
He didn't kill anyone, he went south!

1238
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:08,400
Why would anybody kill Ned?

1239
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,200
Who killed him?

1240
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:14,200
Little Bill.

1241
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:17,000
The boys caught him. Little Bill...

1242
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:19,100
...beat him up.

1243
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:24,000
He was making him answer questions and
beating him up, then Ned just died.

1244
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:27,100
They got a sign on him
says he was a killer.

1245
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:28,400
A sign?

1246
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:30,800
In front of Greely's.

1247
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:33,100
A sign on him in front of Greely's!

1248
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:39,700
These questions he was asking...

1249
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:42,100
...what were they?

1250
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,800
About where you and him was.

1251
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,400
Then what?

1252
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:55,700
A cowboy come in saying you killed
Quick Mike in the shithouse at the Bar T.

1253
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:59,500
So Little Bill killed
him for what we done?

1254
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:01,200
Not on purpose.

1255
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:03,700
But he started hurting him worse.

1256
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:05,600
Making him tell stuff.

1257
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:07,300
First, Ned wouldn't talk.

1258
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,900
Then Little Bill hurt him so
bad, he said who you was.

1259
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:17,200
He said how you was really
William Munny out of Missouri...

1260
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:20,500
Little Bill said, "The
same William Munny...

1261
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:24,200
...who dynamited the railroad in '69,
killing women and children?"

1262
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:26,800
Ned said you done a lot worse and was...

1263
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:29,800
...more cold-blooded
than William Bonney.

1264
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:33,200
Said if he hurt Ned again,
you'd come kill him...

1265
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:36,000
...Iike you killed the
U.S. Marshal in '70.

1266
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:42,900
That didn't scare him, did it?

1267
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,000
No, sir.

1268
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:55,100
Give me your Schofield.

1269
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:56,900
Why?

1270
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Give it.

1271
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:06,600
You keep it.

1272
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:08,500
I won't use it.

1273
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,900
I won't kill nobody no more.

1274
01:48:16,300 --> 01:48:17,900
I ain't like you, Will.

1275
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:23,600
You better ride on back, Miss.

1276
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:30,500
Keep all of it. It's yours.

1277
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:34,700
What about spectacles
and fancy clothes?

1278
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:38,100
I'd rather be blind
and ragged than dead.

1279
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:41,300
You don't have to worry, Kid.

1280
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:43,200
I ain't going to kill you.

1281
01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:45,900
You're the only friend I got.

1282
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:55,800
Take this money and give my share...

1283
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:57,800
...and Ned's share to my kids.

1284
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:01,800
Tell them if I ain't back in a week,
to give half to Sally Two Trees.

1285
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:04,600
You keep the rest. Get them spectacles.

1286
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:06,500
You'll go kill Little Bill?

1287
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:09,100
Stay clear of folks you see.

1288
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:10,800
A lot will want to hang you.

1289
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:12,400
Get going.

1290
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:58,900
I'll say this just one more
time, so don't ask me again!

1291
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:03,600
Those on the posse today got one
drink coming from the county budget!

1292
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:08,700
And those who rode
yesterday get another drink.

1293
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:11,400
Hold it!

1294
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:13,200
That's two!

1295
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:16,400
After that, it comes
out of your own pocket!

1296
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:19,100
We'll pull out early in the morning.

1297
01:50:19,200 --> 01:50:23,600
We'll chase them clear to Texas,
so don't spend too much money.

1298
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:27,000
We'll divide up into four parties!

1299
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:29,600
We'll hit all the farms and trails...

1300
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:31,200
...in a big circle.

1301
01:50:31,300 --> 01:50:33,200
We're bound to find somebody...

1302
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:35,500
...who seen these skunks.

1303
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,300
Who owns this shithole?

1304
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:04,700
Fat man.

1305
01:51:05,100 --> 01:51:06,500
Speak up.

1306
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:10,800
I own this establishment.

1307
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:17,400
I bought it from Greely
for a thousand dollars.

1308
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:20,500
Clear out of there.

1309
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:24,700
Hold it!

1310
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:37,700
Sir, you are a cowardly son-of-a-bitch!

1311
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,700
You just shot an unarmed man.

1312
01:51:41,300 --> 01:51:46,100
He should've armed himself if he's going
to decorate his saloon with my friend.

1313
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:49,300
You'd be William Munny
out of Missouri...

1314
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:51,600
...killer of women and children.

1315
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:53,400
That's right.

1316
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:57,100
I've killed women and children.

1317
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:02,200
I killed just about everything
that walks or crawls.

1318
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:05,900
And I'm here to kill you, Little Bill.

1319
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:08,700
For what you did to Ned.

1320
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:15,000
You boys better move away.

1321
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:26,200
Gentlemen...

1322
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:29,000
...he's got one barrel left.

1323
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:32,000
When he fires that, use your pistols...

1324
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:35,100
...and shoot him down like
the mangy scoundrel he is!

1325
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:51,300
Misfire! Kill the son-of-a-bitch!

1326
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:30,400
Any man don't want to get killed,
better clear on out the back.

1327
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:14,800
I'm shot! I've been shot!

1328
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:16,600
You ain't shot.

1329
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:25,000
I don't have a gun. I am not armed.

1330
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:28,100
Pick up that rifle.

1331
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,100
Pick it up.

1332
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:34,500
Shells too.

1333
01:54:47,100 --> 01:54:48,600
You killed Little Bill.

1334
01:54:49,900 --> 01:54:51,500
You ain't armed?

1335
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:55,700
I'm not. I don't have a gun.

1336
01:54:55,700 --> 01:54:58,500
I've never had a gun. I'm a writer!

1337
01:54:59,700 --> 01:55:01,000
A writer?

1338
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:04,100
- Letters and such?
- Books.

1339
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:05,800
Books.

1340
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:10,300
I don't believe it, you killed
five men. Single-handed.

1341
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:20,500
That's a Spencer rifle, right?

1342
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,500
Who'd you kill first?

1343
01:55:34,100 --> 01:55:36,400
"When confronted by superior numbers...

1344
01:55:36,500 --> 01:55:39,800
...an experienced gunfighter will
fire on the best shot first."

1345
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:43,500
Little Bill said that.
You probably killed him first.

1346
01:55:44,900 --> 01:55:47,000
I was lucky in the order.

1347
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:50,700
I'm always lucky when it
comes to killing folks.

1348
01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:56,200
Who was next? Clyde, right?

1349
01:55:56,300 --> 01:55:59,000
You killed Clyde, or
was it Deputy Andy--

1350
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:01,800
All I can tell you is who'll be last.

1351
01:56:36,700 --> 01:56:38,700
I don't deserve this...

1352
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:42,300
...to die like this.

1353
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:46,900
I was building a house.

1354
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:50,400
"Deserve's" got nothing to do with it.

1355
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:55,200
I'll see you in hell, William Munny.

1356
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:36,100
All right, I'm coming out!

1357
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:39,000
Any man I see out there, I'll kill him!

1358
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:42,000
Anyone takes a shot at me...

1359
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:45,600
...I'll not only kill
him, but his wife...

1360
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:47,500
...and all his friends...

1361
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:50,100
...and burn his damn house down!

1362
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:58,700
Nobody better shoot!

1363
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:15,700
Charley, go ahead. Shoot him!

1364
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:32,800
Hell, no! I ain't no deputy!

1365
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:54,900
You better bury Ned right!

1366
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:59,000
You better not cut up nor
otherwise harm no whores!

1367
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:06,400
Or I'll come back and kill every
one of you sons-of-bitches.
