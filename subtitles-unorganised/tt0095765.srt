1
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,565
Yes, Salvatore.
Salvatore Di Vita.

2
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:17,336
What do you mean
you don't know him?

3
00:02:17,413 --> 00:02:21,180
Yes, that's right.
This is his mother.

4
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:25,688
I'm calling from Sicily.
I've been trying all day.

5
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,194
I see. He's not there.

6
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:37,094
Then can you tell me, please...

7
00:02:39,705 --> 00:02:44,201
656-220-56.

8
00:02:44,278 --> 00:02:46,211
Thank you. Good-bye.

9
00:02:51,385 --> 00:02:53,286
Mama, it's no use calling.

10
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:56,324
He's a busy man.
He could be anywhere.

11
00:02:56,391 --> 00:02:58,586
He won't remember anymore.

12
00:02:59,795 --> 00:03:01,957
Come on, let it go.

13
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:04,967
He hasn't been here in 30 years.

14
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,800
You know how he is.

15
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,143
He'll remember.

16
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:17,443
I'm sure he'll remember.
I know him better than you.

17
00:03:17,515 --> 00:03:22,283
If he finds out later
we didn't tell him, he'll be upset.

18
00:03:23,757 --> 00:03:28,285
I'd like to talk
to Mr. Salvatore Di Vita.

19
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:30,829
This is his mother.

20
00:04:05,304 --> 00:04:08,103
What the hell are you looking at?

21
00:04:58,266 --> 00:04:59,699
Salvatore...

22
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:02,904
what time is it?

23
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,374
It's very late.

24
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:13,846
I'm sorry. There was no way
to let you know.

25
00:05:15,452 --> 00:05:17,511
Go back to sleep.

26
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,594
Your mother called.

27
00:05:25,296 --> 00:05:27,788
She took me for someone else.

28
00:05:29,034 --> 00:05:30,866
What did you tell her?

29
00:05:30,937 --> 00:05:34,135
I played along.
I didn't want to disappoint her.

30
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,198
We had a long talk.

31
00:05:37,912 --> 00:05:40,779
She said you haven't visited her
in 30 years.

32
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:43,977
When she wants to see you,
she comes to Rome.

33
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,748
She called just to say that?

34
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:52,956
No.

35
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,263
She said someone died...
someone named Alfredo.

36
00:05:58,335 --> 00:06:00,530
The funeral is tomorrow.

37
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,438
Who is he, a relative?

38
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:08,579
No. Go to sleep.

39
00:07:24,102 --> 00:07:27,402
This boy will be
the death of me.

40
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:42,945
Toto!

41
00:07:54,972 --> 00:07:57,439
Better late than never.

42
00:07:57,507 --> 00:08:02,070
How often must I say it?
Without the bell, I lose my place.

43
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:06,412
You're always sleeping.
What do you do at night, eat?

44
00:08:06,483 --> 00:08:10,819
Father, at my house
we don't even eat at noon.

45
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,382
The veterinarian says so.
That's why I'm tired.

46
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,260
I know why you're tired.
Don't think I don't.

47
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,767
Now run along home.
I've something to do.

48
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,827
- Can I come?
- No, you cannot.

49
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:26,739
- Yes, yes!
- Toto, out!

50
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:28,969
I want to! I want to!

51
00:08:40,156 --> 00:08:41,589
Alfredo.

52
00:08:47,132 --> 00:08:49,066
You can start.

53
00:09:01,347 --> 00:09:03,782
Here we go again.

54
00:09:21,838 --> 00:09:23,703
Fix the picture!

55
00:09:56,077 --> 00:09:59,479
<i>Pepe, one day we'll have it all.</i>

56
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:03,047
<i>We'll go away together...</i>

57
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:06,182
<i>live the easy life...</i>

58
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:08,748
<i>where no one knows us.</i>

59
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:12,023
<i>Forget it.</i>

60
00:10:12,096 --> 00:10:14,963
<i>You don't love me anymore.</i>

61
00:10:31,018 --> 00:10:33,044
<i>It would be nice...</i>

62
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:35,521
<i>if you could spare
a few kind words.</i>

63
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:37,786
<i>I can't.</i>

64
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:40,020
<i>Oh, well. Thanks anyway.</i>

65
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,247
One pair, two pair!

66
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:29,220
One hundred lire! Real nylon!

67
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:48,333
You mustn't come here.

68
00:12:48,411 --> 00:12:51,540
Can't you get it through
your thick skull?

69
00:12:51,615 --> 00:12:53,948
If the film catches fire...

70
00:12:54,018 --> 00:12:57,077
little as you are,
you'll go up... voom!

71
00:12:57,154 --> 00:13:00,215
"And turn into a lump of coal."

72
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:05,823
Like to wag your tongue, eh?

73
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,991
One day I'll cut it off.

74
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:11,469
Like that.

75
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:28,178
Can I have it?

76
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:30,658
Come on, can I have it?

77
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:33,863
Well, can I?

78
00:13:37,202 --> 00:13:38,760
What, are you deaf?

79
00:13:38,836 --> 00:13:42,830
I have to splice it back in
before I return the film.

80
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:45,537
You're such a pest!

81
00:13:45,611 --> 00:13:50,207
Why didn't you splice these in
when you gave the films back?

82
00:13:52,986 --> 00:13:57,651
Sometimes I can't find
the right place, so they stay here.

83
00:13:57,725 --> 00:14:00,159
Anyway, they kiss too much.

84
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:03,795
Then I can have them.

85
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:06,232
No. Now look, come here.

86
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:11,463
Before I kick your behind,
let's make a deal.

87
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,442
All those are yours...
a present.

88
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:15,910
Thanks.

89
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:20,350
But one, you keep out of here,
and two, they stay with me. Got it?

90
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:21,749
All right.

91
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,380
Right. Then we agree.
Now scram.

92
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:38,902
What kind of a deal is that?

93
00:14:38,973 --> 00:14:42,410
If they're mine,
how come you keep them?

94
00:14:46,681 --> 00:14:49,207
Don't come back,
or I'll split your head open!

95
00:14:58,662 --> 00:15:00,096
"Shoot first, think later."

96
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:05,431
"This is no job for cowards,
you backstabbing dog!"

97
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:14,303
"Hey, you! Hands off the gold,
you rotten bastard!"

98
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:21,613
"You dirty swine,
stay away from me...

99
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,159
or I'll smash your face in."

100
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:47,709
Mama, if the war's over,
why doesn't Papa come back?

101
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:52,221
He'll come back, you'll see.
One of these days.

102
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:56,288
I don't remember him.

103
00:15:56,363 --> 00:15:57,830
Where's Russia?

104
00:15:58,664 --> 00:16:01,190
It takes years to get there...

105
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:03,533
and years to come back.

106
00:16:05,273 --> 00:16:07,834
Go to bed. It's late.

107
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:47,019
You can fool your mother,
but not me!

108
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:52,919
Get your diploma
and join the police! Lazybones!

109
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:55,820
Good-for-nothing!

110
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:04,363
Get a move on!

111
00:17:17,022 --> 00:17:20,254
Well?
What is 5 times 5?

112
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:24,519
Thirty.

113
00:17:32,274 --> 00:17:33,936
Silence!

114
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,409
The fives times table, dimwit.

115
00:17:36,478 --> 00:17:38,538
One times 5 is 5...

116
00:17:38,614 --> 00:17:41,379
2 times 5 is 10...

117
00:17:41,452 --> 00:17:44,012
3 times 5 is 15...

118
00:17:44,088 --> 00:17:46,022
4 times 5 is 20.

119
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,320
5 times 5?

120
00:17:49,928 --> 00:17:50,917
Forty.

121
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,869
Silence!

122
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:05,906
Boccia...

123
00:18:07,047 --> 00:18:09,107
twenty-five.

124
00:18:09,183 --> 00:18:13,848
Learn your times tables,
or you'll never get a job.

125
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:17,284
For the last time...

126
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,088
what is 5 times 5?

127
00:18:19,161 --> 00:18:20,150
Christmas!

128
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,037
I paid to get in.
I'm seeing the movie.

129
00:19:03,814 --> 00:19:07,147
Get down from there, you rascal.

130
00:19:07,217 --> 00:19:09,152
Go back to your seat.

131
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,452
Worse than rabbits.
They're all over the place.

132
00:19:13,524 --> 00:19:15,493
Little monsters.

133
00:19:24,938 --> 00:19:26,371
<i>I'm off to Oregon.</i>

134
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:28,499
<i>Wait for me at my ranch.</i>

135
00:19:29,643 --> 00:19:31,771
<i>Wait for a dead man?</i>

136
00:19:31,847 --> 00:19:34,508
<i>A star-studded cast...</i>

137
00:19:34,582 --> 00:19:36,244
<i>featuring John Wayne...</i>

138
00:19:36,318 --> 00:19:37,512
<i>Claire Trevor...</i>

139
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:53,466
Hello, everyone!

140
00:19:53,538 --> 00:19:56,302
- Can't I say hello?
- It's a double feature today.

141
00:19:56,374 --> 00:19:58,365
So? I'm here to sleep.

142
00:19:59,812 --> 00:20:02,406
- Got some smokes?
- American.

143
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:08,850
Cut the news, Alfredo!

144
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:17,792
Shut up!
This stuff is important!

145
00:20:17,865 --> 00:20:21,825
<i>The men and women
who fought in secret...</i>

146
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:24,999
<i>our brave partisans,
are reunited in Rome...</i>

147
00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:27,235
<i>for the first Resistance Rally...</i>

148
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,471
<i>organized by the CVL.</i>

149
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:32,242
<i>Parri is the acting president.
Sandro Pertini...</i>

150
00:20:47,868 --> 00:20:50,234
Good evening, everyone!

151
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:54,471
Will you show the movie already?

152
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:56,305
Sit down and be quiet!

153
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,897
- What does it say?
- I'm illiterate.

154
00:21:23,976 --> 00:21:25,171
You too?

155
00:21:34,822 --> 00:21:37,553
<i>Twelve hours of blood and sweat...</i>

156
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:42,653
<i>and what they bring home
barely keeps them from starving.</i>

157
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:46,992
<i>Yet when they pulled in
their nets...</i>

158
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:49,595
<i>they were full.</i>

159
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:53,605
<i>They wanted 750 lire.</i>

160
00:21:53,677 --> 00:21:55,167
<i>It's always the same.</i>

161
00:21:55,512 --> 00:21:58,710
<i>But they don't pay us enough.</i>

162
00:21:58,783 --> 00:22:00,775
<i>That's how it's always been.</i>

163
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:03,013
<i>And it's never going to change.</i>

164
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,986
I knew it!

165
00:22:34,258 --> 00:22:38,024
In 20 years I've never seen
a kiss on the screen!

166
00:22:39,163 --> 00:22:42,258
As if they'd let us!

167
00:22:44,904 --> 00:22:47,303
Kiss my ass!

168
00:23:45,607 --> 00:23:48,577
- Don Vincenzo.
- You and you, to work.

169
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:50,634
What about me?

170
00:23:50,713 --> 00:23:53,443
Go ask Stalin for a job.

171
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:56,975
His day will come.
You watch.

172
00:23:58,255 --> 00:23:59,848
I always get left out.

173
00:24:00,892 --> 00:24:04,350
Good movie.
The kid really acted well.

174
00:24:04,428 --> 00:24:06,191
Too bad he was so unlucky.

175
00:24:06,264 --> 00:24:09,393
What a jackass to buy that boat.

176
00:24:09,468 --> 00:24:13,097
Idiot, you didn't get it at all.

177
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:19,343
Right, boys,
you work from dawn to dusk.

178
00:24:19,413 --> 00:24:22,383
And don't ask how much it pays.

179
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,380
I've been looking for you all day.
Did you get the milk?

180
00:24:55,354 --> 00:24:57,447
Where's the money?

181
00:24:58,825 --> 00:25:00,190
It got stolen.

182
00:25:02,063 --> 00:25:04,054
You spent it at the movies?

183
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:09,333
Movies, always movies!

184
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:14,269
Signora Maria, stop.

185
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:16,903
Leave him alone. Take it easy.

186
00:25:18,381 --> 00:25:21,317
And you,
why do you tell lies?

187
00:25:21,385 --> 00:25:23,319
You know you got in for free.

188
00:25:23,387 --> 00:25:26,323
Tell your mother.

189
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,722
Maybe he lost the money inside.

190
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:31,284
- How much did you have?
- Fifty lire.

191
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:37,398
What did you find
under the seats tonight?

192
00:25:41,408 --> 00:25:42,705
A comb.

193
00:25:47,115 --> 00:25:48,241
Two shoe lifts.

194
00:25:51,853 --> 00:25:54,084
- A can of tobacco...
- And...

195
00:25:54,857 --> 00:25:58,055
fifty lire.

196
00:26:04,234 --> 00:26:06,294
See?

197
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,566
Thank you, Alfredo.

198
00:26:21,254 --> 00:26:23,745
I knew where you were going.

199
00:26:23,823 --> 00:26:26,793
The square is mine!
It's mine!

200
00:26:30,932 --> 00:26:33,059
It's midnight. Midnight!

201
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:36,070
Out! Shoo!
I have to close the square.

202
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:07,701
Hard on the feet, eh, Father?

203
00:28:08,845 --> 00:28:12,213
On the way there, it's all downhill
and all the saints help out.

204
00:28:12,283 --> 00:28:15,776
But coming back,
the saints just watch.

205
00:28:16,721 --> 00:28:18,814
If that's God's will.

206
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,983
See you tonight.

207
00:28:27,668 --> 00:28:29,158
What's wrong?

208
00:28:29,235 --> 00:28:30,794
Your foot this time.

209
00:28:32,973 --> 00:28:35,408
It's always something with you.
What can I do?

210
00:28:39,381 --> 00:28:42,475
Alfredo,
did you know my father?

211
00:28:42,551 --> 00:28:45,349
What a question.
Of course I knew him.

212
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:50,190
Tall, thin, friendly guy
with a big moustache like mine.

213
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:53,890
Always smiling.
He looked a lot like Clark Gable.

214
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:58,867
Now that I'll be
in fifth grade...

215
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:02,065
I don't say I should
come in the booth...

216
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,406
but can't we at least be friends?

217
00:29:05,478 --> 00:29:10,439
"I choose my friends for looks,
my enemies for intelligence."

218
00:29:10,518 --> 00:29:13,783
You're too sly to be my friend.

219
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:16,653
I always tell my children...

220
00:29:16,724 --> 00:29:19,990
"Be careful
how you choose your friends."

221
00:29:20,061 --> 00:29:22,724
You haven't got any children.

222
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,065
When I do, I'll tell them.

223
00:29:32,376 --> 00:29:36,176
Don't cry, don't cry.
It's all right.

224
00:29:36,246 --> 00:29:40,081
The fire's out.
It's over. Mama's here.

225
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,944
What happened?

226
00:29:43,022 --> 00:29:45,047
Monster!

227
00:29:45,124 --> 00:29:47,957
Your little sister
could have burned to death!

228
00:29:48,027 --> 00:29:50,462
It's all your fault!

229
00:29:54,735 --> 00:29:58,694
I told you not to keep your film
under the bed by the fire pan.

230
00:29:58,773 --> 00:30:01,834
Even the photographs burned!

231
00:30:11,421 --> 00:30:14,585
He could have set
the house on fire!

232
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,658
You and your stupid movies!

233
00:30:19,964 --> 00:30:23,924
Aren't you ashamed to play
with a little boy at your age?

234
00:30:24,003 --> 00:30:26,733
What did I do?

235
00:30:26,806 --> 00:30:28,467
Who gave him the film?

236
00:30:30,543 --> 00:30:33,604
Don't do it again.
He's crazy. Crazy, I tell you!

237
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,739
All I hear about is movies
and Alfredo.

238
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:37,409
Alfredo and movies!

239
00:30:38,785 --> 00:30:41,983
Swear you won't let him in again.
Swear it!

240
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,354
You have my word.

241
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,164
May God grant me one wish.

242
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:53,794
May he send your father home
to whip you!

243
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:57,773
Papa won't come back,
and I know why.

244
00:30:58,102 --> 00:30:59,535
He's dead.

245
00:31:00,672 --> 00:31:02,104
That's not true.

246
00:31:04,376 --> 00:31:06,775
I'll show you. He'll come back.

247
00:31:36,944 --> 00:31:41,210
"Thus man's good
and evil deeds do pass...

248
00:31:41,281 --> 00:31:45,615
while time flows on like a river."

249
00:32:05,274 --> 00:32:07,765
They smoke like chimneys!

250
00:32:15,585 --> 00:32:17,575
No. Go buy a ticket.

251
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:40,574
What was that?

252
00:32:41,846 --> 00:32:45,213
I'll make mincemeat out of you!
You'll have to reckon with me!

253
00:32:59,632 --> 00:33:01,793
Signora Anna!

254
00:33:23,457 --> 00:33:27,224
Don't blame me. Your wife
told me to bring your lunch.

255
00:33:28,762 --> 00:33:32,631
I told my mother
you didn't give me the film.

256
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,395
It wasn't your fault.

257
00:33:34,469 --> 00:33:39,406
I thought it was a joke
about film catching fire.

258
00:33:39,474 --> 00:33:42,535
I just wanted to tell you.
Now I'll go.

259
00:33:45,114 --> 00:33:48,572
Toto, come here.

260
00:33:50,252 --> 00:33:52,949
Come on and sit down.

261
00:33:56,025 --> 00:33:59,894
Now listen.
I got into this business at age ten.

262
00:34:00,897 --> 00:34:03,764
Back then, we didn't have
fancy machines.

263
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:07,735
Movies were silent.

264
00:34:07,804 --> 00:34:10,365
You turned the projector by hand...

265
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:11,998
with a crank.

266
00:34:12,075 --> 00:34:14,135
All the livelong day!

267
00:34:14,212 --> 00:34:18,012
And that damn crank
was so hard.

268
00:34:18,082 --> 00:34:21,984
If you got tired
and slowed down a bit...

269
00:34:23,221 --> 00:34:25,952
like a shot... voom!...
everything went up in flames.

270
00:34:28,961 --> 00:34:31,395
So why not teach me?

271
00:34:31,463 --> 00:34:34,591
Now that there's no crank
and it's easier.

272
00:34:35,434 --> 00:34:38,597
Because I don't want to.

273
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,401
This is no job for you.

274
00:34:41,474 --> 00:34:43,771
You're like a slave...

275
00:34:43,843 --> 00:34:45,834
and always by yourself.

276
00:34:45,912 --> 00:34:49,370
You see a film 100 times.
You've nothing else to do.

277
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:53,511
You talk to Greta Garbo
and Tyrone Power like an idiot.

278
00:34:53,587 --> 00:34:55,612
You work like a dog.

279
00:34:55,689 --> 00:34:59,626
Even holidays...
Easter, Christmas.

280
00:34:59,693 --> 00:35:02,321
You only get Good Friday off.

281
00:35:02,396 --> 00:35:05,957
And if they hadn't
stuck Christ on a cross...

282
00:35:06,033 --> 00:35:08,502
we'd even work then.

283
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,368
So why don't you change jobs?

284
00:35:18,446 --> 00:35:20,347
Because I'm a nitwit.

285
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:26,215
Who else around here
could run a projector?

286
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:30,953
Nobody. It takes
an imbecile like me.

287
00:35:32,261 --> 00:35:34,729
I never had any luck.

288
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:38,461
When I was little,
there was a war.

289
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,795
When I grew up,
there was another war.

290
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:49,775
So, you want to be a stick-in-the-mud
like me? How about it?

291
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,173
Attaboy, Toto.

292
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,556
I'm telling you
for your own good.

293
00:35:58,624 --> 00:36:03,391
In here, you suffocate in summer
and freeze to death in winter.

294
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:05,759
You breathe all these fumes.

295
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,732
And you earn chicken feed.

296
00:36:09,101 --> 00:36:11,899
Don't you like
anything about it?

297
00:36:11,971 --> 00:36:13,905
Oh, you get used to it.

298
00:36:13,973 --> 00:36:15,873
Sometimes you can hear...

299
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:18,206
that the house is full of people...

300
00:36:18,278 --> 00:36:20,508
laughing and having fun.

301
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,980
Then you're happy too.

302
00:36:23,049 --> 00:36:25,847
It makes you feel good
to hear them.

303
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:28,547
Like you're the one
who made them laugh...

304
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:32,981
who made them forget
their troubles.

305
00:36:34,095 --> 00:36:35,858
That part I like.

306
00:36:47,342 --> 00:36:51,335
I might as well be speaking Greek!
What're you up to?

307
00:36:51,413 --> 00:36:55,110
You pretend to listen,
then you trick me!

308
00:36:55,183 --> 00:36:58,483
Your mother's right!
You're crazy!

309
00:36:59,988 --> 00:37:03,948
How'd the rascal do it?
He learned by watching.

310
00:37:06,396 --> 00:37:10,730
I'm telling the cashier
not to let you in!

311
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,636
And I'll see Father Adelfio!
No more altar boy! Finished!

312
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,141
Up yours!

313
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,480
I got it! I won!
I won the football lottery!

314
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:44,468
The Neapolitan won the lottery!

315
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:50,031
Hey, Ciccio from Naples
won the lottery!

316
00:37:51,444 --> 00:37:55,346
It's always the northerners
who get lucky.

317
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:32,118
The square is mine! All mine!

318
00:38:35,324 --> 00:38:38,987
Hold still!
Got ants in your pants?

319
00:38:40,263 --> 00:38:42,560
You got a lice factory up here.

320
00:38:42,631 --> 00:38:44,293
Beat it.

321
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,484
What're you after?

322
00:39:01,552 --> 00:39:03,418
Get out of here.

323
00:39:12,831 --> 00:39:17,530
A merchant owns two stores.

324
00:39:19,138 --> 00:39:22,664
In one, he sells fruit.

325
00:39:23,884 --> 00:39:25,909
Be seated.

326
00:39:25,986 --> 00:39:27,215
Professor...

327
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:31,282
the night-school students are here
for the grade-school diploma exam.

328
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,100
Silence!

329
00:41:31,925 --> 00:41:34,656
Rotten little stinker!

330
00:41:35,296 --> 00:41:37,925
- Toto, help me.
- Silence!

331
00:41:39,567 --> 00:41:41,798
I can't do this damn thing!

332
00:43:03,428 --> 00:43:05,726
<i>Francesco Messana...</i>

333
00:43:05,797 --> 00:43:07,856
<i>you're under arrest.</i>

334
00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:14,071
Good riddance!

335
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:27,114
Kiss my ass!
Pencil pusher!

336
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,179
Right here is where
it can catch fire.

337
00:43:30,256 --> 00:43:35,490
If it does, cut here and here,
or the whole reel will burn. Got it?

338
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:45,228
Never!
We'll never have that here.

339
00:43:45,307 --> 00:43:47,799
Which side is the gelatin on?

340
00:43:50,012 --> 00:43:52,481
It tastes good.

341
00:44:01,892 --> 00:44:06,262
The shipping invoice for the film.
Always keep these.

342
00:44:06,331 --> 00:44:08,060
I will, Alfredo.

343
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:09,997
Don't ever forget them.

344
00:44:28,021 --> 00:44:32,651
This is for you.
Today you load the reels yourself.

345
00:44:34,028 --> 00:44:37,964
- It's so high!
- Now you can run it alone.

346
00:44:38,032 --> 00:44:40,364
Hold it.

347
00:44:44,238 --> 00:44:47,208
- What a build!
- My turn!

348
00:44:47,276 --> 00:44:51,212
Say good-bye to Peppino.
He's leaving for Germany.

349
00:45:00,256 --> 00:45:02,919
Why won't you say good-bye?

350
00:45:02,993 --> 00:45:06,429
My father says he's a communist.

351
00:45:06,497 --> 00:45:08,431
God keep you, Mama.

352
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:10,866
Will he really find work
in Germany?

353
00:45:10,936 --> 00:45:14,064
Who knows?
It's an adventure.

354
00:45:14,139 --> 00:45:16,039
All you can do is hope.

355
00:45:17,443 --> 00:45:19,467
Screw this country!

356
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:25,018
Go work in Germany,
you and your Stalin.

357
00:45:25,085 --> 00:45:26,984
Good-bye, Mama.

358
00:45:28,054 --> 00:45:31,821
Good-bye, Peppino!
Come back soon!

359
00:45:31,892 --> 00:45:33,985
We'll see you.

360
00:45:39,433 --> 00:45:43,427
Lucky thing Germany
is closer than Russia.

361
00:45:47,609 --> 00:45:50,670
<i>After six years,
the return of spring fashion.</i>

362
00:45:51,147 --> 00:45:53,581
<i>Fresh and breezy...</i>

363
00:45:53,649 --> 00:45:56,346
<i>unlike the stodgy wartime styles.</i>

364
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,301
I'll make mincemeat out of you!

365
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:18,309
"You'll have to reckon with me!"

366
00:46:40,602 --> 00:46:42,626
<i>Another sad chapter...</i>

367
00:46:42,703 --> 00:46:44,604
<i>in the tragedy
of our men in Russia.</i>

368
00:46:45,373 --> 00:46:47,034
<i>The Defense Ministry...</i>

369
00:46:47,108 --> 00:46:50,168
<i>has released a new list
of Italian soldiers killed in battle...</i>

370
00:46:50,245 --> 00:46:53,113
<i>until now considered missing.</i>

371
00:46:53,182 --> 00:46:57,915
<i>The names will be posted
by local military authorities...</i>

372
00:46:57,987 --> 00:47:02,083
<i>who will directly notify
the families involved.</i>

373
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:10,330
<i>However, we don't know
where he's buried.</i>

374
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,802
<i>Here's the form for the pension.
Sign it, please.</i>

375
00:49:52,348 --> 00:49:55,839
Get out! Go home!
We can't have another show!

376
00:49:55,917 --> 00:50:00,618
It's late. Be reasonable.
We can't show it again!

377
00:50:02,892 --> 00:50:05,453
Some people
sat through it twice!

378
00:50:08,432 --> 00:50:11,663
We've been waiting for an hour!

379
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:20,175
Tomorrow we'll have
another movie.

380
00:50:20,245 --> 00:50:24,875
A western. Word of honor!
Go home to bed.

381
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:31,886
They'll wreck the Paradiso!
All hell will break loose!

382
00:50:35,562 --> 00:50:38,554
Alfredo, let us in!

383
00:50:38,665 --> 00:50:41,863
What can I do?

384
00:50:46,173 --> 00:50:49,233
"A mob doesn't think.

385
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:51,541
They don't know
what they're doing."

386
00:50:52,681 --> 00:50:56,845
<i>Spencer Tracy said that in Fury.</i>

387
00:50:56,918 --> 00:50:59,945
Well, what do you say?

388
00:51:00,022 --> 00:51:03,753
Shall we let the poor devils
see their film?

389
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:08,189
Sure. But how?

390
00:51:10,366 --> 00:51:15,328
"If you have no faith in me,
have faith in what you see."

391
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:18,602
Now get your butt off that stool.

392
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:24,010
Get ready.

393
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,347
Abracadabra.

394
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:32,847
Look the other direction.

395
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:10,232
Go look out the window.

396
00:52:15,105 --> 00:52:17,768
Alfredo, it's beautiful.

397
00:52:18,742 --> 00:52:22,076
Over there! It's the movie!

398
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,984
Bravo, Alfredo!

399
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:34,053
Thank you, Alfredo!

400
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,429
What's going on?

401
00:52:45,072 --> 00:52:47,302
It's a movie!

402
00:52:49,844 --> 00:52:51,835
To hell with you all!

403
00:52:58,354 --> 00:53:00,947
There's no sound!

404
00:53:01,023 --> 00:53:03,821
Shall we make them happy?

405
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,722
Want to go down?

406
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:41,396
Go on.

407
00:53:58,186 --> 00:54:00,314
- Look.
- Good Lord!

408
00:54:06,195 --> 00:54:08,993
And Nunzio, half price.

409
00:54:21,412 --> 00:54:24,472
You have to buy tickets, folks.

410
00:54:27,853 --> 00:54:29,115
Reduced rates.

411
00:54:29,188 --> 00:54:32,214
Up yours! The square
belongs to everyone!

412
00:54:32,291 --> 00:54:34,282
Oh, no!

413
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,262
The square is mine! Don't joke
about that or you'll piss me off!

414
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:25,605
Someone, help me!

415
00:56:51,645 --> 00:56:55,081
- Nunzio, what's wrong with you?
- I can't breathe!

416
00:57:22,812 --> 00:57:25,304
Alfredo! Alfredo!

417
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,652
Help! Help!

418
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,892
Help!

419
00:57:53,514 --> 00:57:56,415
Poor Alfredo.
What a shame.

420
00:58:00,288 --> 00:58:02,449
All burned!

421
00:58:05,594 --> 00:58:07,619
It all burned down!

422
00:58:23,814 --> 00:58:25,975
What do we do now?

423
00:58:26,049 --> 00:58:29,850
We have no more entertainment.
Nothing.

424
00:58:29,921 --> 00:58:33,220
Where will we get the money
to rebuild?

425
00:58:35,394 --> 00:58:39,159
Take a look at Ciccio.
So spiffy, you'd hardly know him.

426
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:42,758
Who has that kind of money?

427
00:58:50,909 --> 00:58:53,811
The new Cinema Paradiso!

428
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:59,381
Come in, come in!

429
00:59:29,453 --> 00:59:32,650
This theater is for you!

430
00:59:40,331 --> 00:59:43,859
He's just a boy.
What about labor laws?

431
00:59:43,936 --> 00:59:47,770
I got the license
through connections.

432
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,173
Don't ask me
how their minds work.

433
00:59:50,243 --> 00:59:55,010
Officially, I'm the projectionist,
but the money goes to Toto.

434
00:59:55,082 --> 00:59:59,247
Stay on your toes, Toto.
No sleeping.

435
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,480
We've had enough disasters.

436
01:00:01,555 --> 01:00:04,525
Do what poor Alfredo taught you.

437
01:00:04,592 --> 01:00:06,390
And God bless you.

438
01:00:07,662 --> 01:00:09,323
Thank you, Father.

439
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:14,734
What is this, a funeral?
Life goes on! Gaiety! Music!

440
01:01:54,848 --> 01:01:57,112
Get a load of that!

441
01:01:58,718 --> 01:02:00,619
Our Father!

442
01:02:21,277 --> 01:02:23,872
By God, they're kissing!

443
01:02:28,452 --> 01:02:31,444
I won't watch pornography.

444
01:02:36,861 --> 01:02:39,352
Three cheers for Ciccio!

445
01:03:09,931 --> 01:03:12,298
Any room for me
in this new paradise?

446
01:03:17,439 --> 01:03:20,670
Bring him home after you close.

447
01:03:20,742 --> 01:03:22,403
I'm going, Alfredo.

448
01:03:22,478 --> 01:03:24,412
I'm glad you're here.

449
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:30,582
How're things at school?

450
01:03:30,654 --> 01:03:34,111
Fine, but now that I'm working...

451
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:36,284
maybe I won't go anymore.

452
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,295
No. No, Toto.

453
01:03:39,531 --> 01:03:42,090
Don't do that.

454
01:03:42,167 --> 01:03:44,658
You'll end up
with egg on your face.

455
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:47,659
Why? What does that mean?

456
01:03:47,731 --> 01:03:49,664
It means...

457
01:03:51,502 --> 01:03:55,461
that this isn't your real work.

458
01:03:55,539 --> 01:03:58,337
Right now
the Paradiso needs you...

459
01:03:58,408 --> 01:04:00,375
and you need the Paradiso...

460
01:04:00,443 --> 01:04:01,933
but it's a stopgap.

461
01:04:03,813 --> 01:04:05,803
One day you'll go on...

462
01:04:05,882 --> 01:04:07,873
to other things.

463
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:09,041
Things...

464
01:04:11,087 --> 01:04:13,715
that are more important.

465
01:04:13,789 --> 01:04:15,722
Definitely more important.

466
01:04:18,793 --> 01:04:21,386
I know.

467
01:04:21,462 --> 01:04:24,795
Now that I've lost my sight,
I see better.

468
01:04:25,534 --> 01:04:27,660
Things I never saw before.

469
01:04:27,735 --> 01:04:31,227
All thanks to you,
who saved my life.

470
01:04:31,305 --> 01:04:33,238
I won't forget it.

471
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:37,275
And don't look like that.

472
01:04:37,344 --> 01:04:39,937
I'm not senile yet.
Want proof?

473
01:04:41,017 --> 01:04:43,042
Well, let's see.

474
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:45,054
For example...

475
01:04:45,389 --> 01:04:49,350
right now, the film's out of focus.

476
01:04:49,428 --> 01:04:50,486
Go check.

477
01:04:55,169 --> 01:04:57,832
You're right!
It's out of focus.

478
01:04:57,906 --> 01:04:59,498
How'd you know?

479
01:05:01,311 --> 01:05:03,473
Too hard to explain.

480
01:05:13,661 --> 01:05:15,652
Only two days?

481
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:17,824
What do I care
if you've rented all the prints?

482
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:21,599
I've only had it two days.
They'll rip my head off here!

483
01:05:22,473 --> 01:05:27,275
I wouldn't make it
even if I opened at 8:00 a. M!

484
01:05:27,346 --> 01:05:29,907
This is a big town,
and you know it!

485
01:05:29,983 --> 01:05:32,920
If you screw me over,
I'll go straight to Rome!

486
01:05:32,988 --> 01:05:34,979
You'll pay for this!

487
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:39,051
Don't mess with me,
'cause I'll split your skull open!

488
01:05:39,129 --> 01:05:41,724
Don Ciccio, I have an idea.

489
01:05:41,799 --> 01:05:45,065
Do you remember
that old abandoned movie theater?

490
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,331
What about it?

491
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:50,280
The projector's rusted,
but I could fix it in a couple of days.

492
01:05:50,984 --> 01:05:53,181
You have the place cleaned up...

493
01:05:53,588 --> 01:05:58,029
hire a projectionist from the city,
and we'll have two theaters!

494
01:05:58,097 --> 01:05:59,929
Bullshit!

495
01:06:00,001 --> 01:06:01,993
Don't start, Toto.

496
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:05,269
Titanus will only let me have
one print.

497
01:06:05,342 --> 01:06:07,437
If I ask for another one,
they'll cut my head off...

498
01:06:07,513 --> 01:06:10,746
and play ball with it.

499
01:06:11,189 --> 01:06:14,023
Who says we need two copies?

500
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:15,599
Well, don't we?

501
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:57,660
We see the crib.
The child's asleep.

502
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:19,101
<i>Help her!</i>

503
01:07:22,775 --> 01:07:25,938
"The lawyer told me.
Now I know."

504
01:07:26,012 --> 01:07:29,380
<i>The lawyer told me.
Now I know.</i>

505
01:07:30,118 --> 01:07:35,024
"And everyone must know.
Yes, everyone must know."

506
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:36,890
<i>Everyone must know.</i>

507
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:41,633
"You believe me?"

508
01:07:44,373 --> 01:07:46,366
"Yes, I believe you."

509
01:07:58,495 --> 01:08:01,225
"Our own home.
How I've dreamed of it!"

510
01:08:11,781 --> 01:08:12,873
"Tonino!"

511
01:08:17,991 --> 01:08:19,117
"Mama."

512
01:08:40,223 --> 01:08:41,317
"The End."

513
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:54,444
I don't like it!
I don't like it!

514
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,856
I cut the end credits
to go faster.

515
01:09:03,926 --> 01:09:07,489
Hurry back with part one.
I'll show a newsreel.

516
01:09:07,565 --> 01:09:10,161
I'll call the police.
Take him.

517
01:09:11,571 --> 01:09:14,565
Just a minute.
Just a minute!

518
01:09:25,226 --> 01:09:26,716
What do you want?

519
01:09:36,143 --> 01:09:38,441
Give me part two.
Here's part one.

520
01:09:38,612 --> 01:09:41,276
Hurry, the house is packed.

521
01:09:44,088 --> 01:09:48,959
What are you doing? Hurry up!
Light the coal, come on!

522
01:09:49,028 --> 01:09:53,126
- The audience is protesting!
- Get her rolling!

523
01:09:58,975 --> 01:10:02,174
Bunch of animals!
Quiet!

524
01:10:24,415 --> 01:10:26,246
To hell with it!

525
01:10:27,486 --> 01:10:29,477
Toto, what's going on?

526
01:10:29,555 --> 01:10:31,718
What the hell is he doing?

527
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:37,498
Come on, Toto.
They're gonna explode!

528
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,730
It's been a half hour!

529
01:10:39,773 --> 01:10:41,708
What can I do?

530
01:10:43,645 --> 01:10:47,276
Where is that son of a jackass?
I'll be ruined!

531
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:51,448
Calm down, calm down.

532
01:10:54,597 --> 01:10:57,931
I'll have you know,
just to see this movie...

533
01:10:58,001 --> 01:11:00,938
I left my wife home
sick in bed...

534
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:03,442
and I haven't seen a thing.

535
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:06,777
If it's not here in ten minutes,
give us back our money...

536
01:11:06,849 --> 01:11:09,181
me and everyone else here...

537
01:11:09,252 --> 01:11:11,950
or I'll wreck the place
with this cane!

538
01:11:17,131 --> 01:11:21,695
Calm down!
Calm down and let me talk.

539
01:11:21,772 --> 01:11:24,868
Tell you what.
I'll show part one over again.

540
01:11:31,288 --> 01:11:34,418
Quiet, quiet!

541
01:11:34,493 --> 01:11:38,659
I've seen the whole movie.
I'll tell you the plot.

542
01:12:10,349 --> 01:12:12,011
Boccia, what happened?

543
01:12:18,962 --> 01:12:21,694
- What are you doing?
- I'm in heaven.

544
01:12:22,101 --> 01:12:24,127
Get out of here!

545
01:12:24,204 --> 01:12:25,832
Scram!

546
01:12:26,841 --> 01:12:28,139
It feels so good!

547
01:12:59,392 --> 01:13:04,493
What's the idea?
Watch the screen, you perverts!

548
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:15,742
Don't touch.

549
01:14:11,439 --> 01:14:14,375
I told you:
It doesn't catch fire.

550
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:20,952
Progress always comes too late.

551
01:14:41,019 --> 01:14:43,420
<i>Workers...</i>

552
01:15:11,567 --> 01:15:13,365
That's right.

553
01:15:14,438 --> 01:15:16,202
Now you've got it.

554
01:15:16,274 --> 01:15:19,734
Come on, take it easy.

555
01:15:20,414 --> 01:15:22,213
Don't be afraid.

556
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:25,152
Do I really have to squeeze
a lemon on it if it bleeds?

557
01:15:25,222 --> 01:15:27,214
Lemon?

558
01:15:28,994 --> 01:15:32,523
Whoever told you such bullshit?

559
01:15:34,437 --> 01:15:37,032
That's right, keep going.

560
01:15:39,077 --> 01:15:41,342
That's right. See?

561
01:15:42,015 --> 01:15:44,348
It's not dangerous, see?

562
01:15:44,419 --> 01:15:45,887
That's right, keep going.

563
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:01,777
Now you're really a man.

564
01:16:01,847 --> 01:16:06,115
What am I saying?
You're not a man, you're a bull!

565
01:16:49,121 --> 01:16:51,420
She's new.

566
01:16:52,325 --> 01:16:54,191
Not bad.

567
01:16:54,262 --> 01:16:55,696
She looks nice.

568
01:16:55,764 --> 01:16:59,862
Her father's the bank manager.
Pride, pomp and circumstance.

569
01:16:59,937 --> 01:17:03,670
Jerks off with his shirt
to keep his hands clean.

570
01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:10,086
Go, man, go!

571
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,114
Excuse me.

572
01:17:34,558 --> 01:17:36,585
You dropped this.

573
01:17:36,662 --> 01:17:38,255
Oh, thanks.

574
01:17:38,332 --> 01:17:40,597
I didn't even notice.

575
01:17:42,171 --> 01:17:44,698
My name's Salvatore.
What's yours?

576
01:17:44,775 --> 01:17:47,267
Elena.
My name's Elena.

577
01:17:47,346 --> 01:17:52,252
I wanted to tell you, well,
the other day at the station...

578
01:17:57,562 --> 01:18:00,590
<i>It's Charlie Chaplin's
Modern Times, right, Toto?</i>

579
01:18:00,667 --> 01:18:02,294
Yes, that's right.

580
01:18:03,472 --> 01:18:06,772
I know that film by heart.

581
01:18:06,843 --> 01:18:10,975
While I was showing it for the
first time in 1940, my first wife died.

582
01:18:11,216 --> 01:18:15,120
They kept it from me all day,
to keep the theater open.

583
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:18,420
I found out after the last show.

584
01:18:20,598 --> 01:18:22,430
I lost my mind.

585
01:18:25,506 --> 01:18:27,669
It's the kind of thing
you never forget.

586
01:18:29,845 --> 01:18:32,839
The small projector?
Your footage?

587
01:18:32,919 --> 01:18:34,612
What do you see?

588
01:18:34,686 --> 01:18:38,415
Slaughterhouse workers
butchering a calf.

589
01:18:38,492 --> 01:18:42,790
Blood all over the floor,
like a lake.

590
01:18:42,673 --> 01:18:45,403
Another calf passes over the lake...

591
01:18:45,476 --> 01:18:47,739
on his way to being slaughtered.

592
01:18:54,217 --> 01:18:56,776
Why'd you stop?
What do we see?

593
01:18:56,852 --> 01:19:01,084
Nothing. We don't see anything.
It's all fuzzy.

594
01:19:03,914 --> 01:19:05,006
A woman.

595
01:19:07,384 --> 01:19:09,408
It's a woman.

596
01:19:10,586 --> 01:19:13,487
Yes, a girl I saw
at the station.

597
01:19:14,223 --> 01:19:16,747
What's she like?

598
01:19:16,825 --> 01:19:18,759
She's very nice.

599
01:19:19,661 --> 01:19:24,189
My age, slim,
long brown hair.

600
01:19:24,266 --> 01:19:28,361
Big blue eyes,
honest and direct.

601
01:19:28,435 --> 01:19:30,630
A little beauty mark
on her lip.

602
01:19:30,704 --> 01:19:34,264
Very small.
You only see it up close.

603
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:39,972
When she smiles, you feel like...
I don't know.

604
01:19:41,047 --> 01:19:42,479
Love.

605
01:19:43,849 --> 01:19:46,113
Love.

606
01:19:50,189 --> 01:19:55,455
I know how it is.
The blue-eyed ones are the worst.

607
01:19:55,526 --> 01:19:59,360
No matter what you do,
they'll never be your friends.

608
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:01,090
There's nothing you can do.

609
01:20:01,164 --> 01:20:05,032
The bigger the man,
the deeper the footprint.

610
01:20:05,101 --> 01:20:10,629
And if he loves, he suffers,
knowing it's a dead-end street.

611
01:20:10,706 --> 01:20:13,300
That's nice,
what you just said.

612
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:14,808
But sad.

613
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:20,809
<i>I didn't say it. It was John Wayne
in The Shepherd of the Hills.</i>

614
01:20:21,816 --> 01:20:24,046
You old pirate!

615
01:21:05,688 --> 01:21:07,178
Hello, Elena.

616
01:21:08,156 --> 01:21:10,317
Why are you running?

617
01:21:10,692 --> 01:21:12,489
Because...

618
01:21:13,929 --> 01:21:16,795
I wanted to tell you...

619
01:21:17,498 --> 01:21:20,262
You remember when we...

620
01:21:22,536 --> 01:21:24,663
Nice day, isn't it?

621
01:21:29,309 --> 01:21:32,176
Yes, really nice.

622
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:37,344
Excuse me, I have to go.
Bye.

623
01:21:41,353 --> 01:21:46,289
What a jerk. What a jerk!

624
01:21:46,357 --> 01:21:48,348
"Nice day, isn't it?"

625
01:21:48,426 --> 01:21:50,018
What an idiot!

626
01:22:00,469 --> 01:22:02,130
You may not believe me...

627
01:22:02,204 --> 01:22:04,502
but I'll play the leading male role
in the story of your life.

628
01:22:04,573 --> 01:22:09,703
Sure, I'm no Marlon Brando,
but take a good look at me.

629
01:22:09,778 --> 01:22:11,803
Am I really so ugly?

630
01:22:15,617 --> 01:22:17,641
So should I give it another try?

631
01:22:17,718 --> 01:22:20,152
Maybe this time I'll succeed.
What do you think?

632
01:22:28,761 --> 01:22:31,355
Hello, I'd like to speak
to Elena, please.

633
01:22:31,431 --> 01:22:33,455
<i>- This is she.
- Elena, is that you?</i>

634
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:36,365
<i>- Yes.
- I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.</i>

635
01:22:36,501 --> 01:22:38,731
This is Salvatore.
Do you remember me?

636
01:22:39,671 --> 01:22:43,367
Listen, I know I make a fool
of myself every time we meet...

637
01:22:43,441 --> 01:22:47,104
but I swear, it's just that
you make me shy.

638
01:22:47,178 --> 01:22:50,045
But the truth is
I do nothing but think of you.

639
01:22:51,281 --> 01:22:54,250
Yes, Elena, you're my last thought
before I fall asleep...

640
01:22:54,317 --> 01:22:57,650
and the first when I wake up.
I dream of you every night.

641
01:22:57,721 --> 01:23:00,086
It doesn't sound romantic
over the phone, but I care about you...

642
01:23:00,155 --> 01:23:02,680
<i>If you don't stop calling,
I'll call the police.</i>

643
01:23:02,758 --> 01:23:04,248
Who's this?

644
01:23:04,326 --> 01:23:06,556
<i>I'm Elena's mother, you idiot!</i>

645
01:23:06,895 --> 01:23:09,727
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Please believe me, I didn't know...

646
01:23:11,099 --> 01:23:13,158
Oh, shit!

647
01:23:13,801 --> 01:23:15,564
I told you so.

648
01:23:15,636 --> 01:23:17,967
You thought I was joking.

649
01:23:18,038 --> 01:23:23,408
But take it from me:
The blue-eyed ones are the worst.

650
01:23:23,477 --> 01:23:27,105
But why? There must be a way
to make her understand.

651
01:23:27,179 --> 01:23:32,014
Don't even try. With feelings,
there's nothing to understand...

652
01:23:32,084 --> 01:23:34,551
and no way to explain.

653
01:23:34,619 --> 01:23:37,986
You talk like you made the world!

654
01:23:38,156 --> 01:23:41,784
Toto, calm down.
Don't take it out on me.

655
01:23:41,859 --> 01:23:43,850
That's all I need.

656
01:23:44,962 --> 01:23:48,659
- Where'd you go?
- Get out of the way!

657
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:50,562
Toto! Come back here!

658
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:56,361
I can't walk on my own.

659
01:24:07,282 --> 01:24:10,375
You better watch your mouth!

660
01:24:10,451 --> 01:24:13,420
With all due respect
to the Lord...

661
01:24:13,487 --> 01:24:15,751
who made the world
in two or three days...

662
01:24:15,823 --> 01:24:18,484
I'd have taken a bit longer...

663
01:24:18,558 --> 01:24:21,584
but in all modesty,
I would've done it better.

664
01:24:21,661 --> 01:24:25,756
Like I said:
You always have an answer.

665
01:24:27,699 --> 01:24:32,568
Just for you, Toto,
I'll tell you a story.

666
01:24:32,638 --> 01:24:34,571
Let's sit down a minute.

667
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:37,073
These old bones of mine...

668
01:24:38,476 --> 01:24:40,410
Once upon a time...

669
01:24:41,479 --> 01:24:44,038
a king gave a feast...

670
01:24:44,114 --> 01:24:47,777
for the loveliest princesses
in the realm.

671
01:24:47,851 --> 01:24:52,116
Now, a soldier
who was standing guard...

672
01:24:52,188 --> 01:24:54,782
saw the king's daughter go by.

673
01:24:54,857 --> 01:24:57,382
She was the most beautiful of all...

674
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:00,826
and he instantly fell in love.

675
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:03,693
But what is a simple soldier...

676
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:06,495
next to the daughter of a king?

677
01:25:07,035 --> 01:25:11,971
Well, at last he succeeded
in meeting her...

678
01:25:12,339 --> 01:25:16,172
and told her he could no longer
live without her.

679
01:25:16,242 --> 01:25:21,236
The princess was so taken
by the depth of his feeling...

680
01:25:21,314 --> 01:25:23,646
that she said to the soldier...

681
01:25:23,716 --> 01:25:26,741
"If you can wait...

682
01:25:26,818 --> 01:25:31,517
for 100 days and 100 nights
under my balcony...

683
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:36,026
at the end
I shall be yours."

684
01:25:37,828 --> 01:25:42,287
With that, the soldier went
and waited one day...

685
01:25:42,365 --> 01:25:45,266
two days, then ten,
then twenty.

686
01:25:45,335 --> 01:25:48,634
Each evening
the princess looked out...

687
01:25:48,705 --> 01:25:50,934
and he never moved!

688
01:25:51,006 --> 01:25:54,737
In rain, in wind, in snow,
he was always there.

689
01:25:54,810 --> 01:25:58,211
Birds shit on his head,
bees stung him...

690
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:00,213
but he didn't budge.

691
01:26:01,816 --> 01:26:03,750
At the end...

692
01:26:05,019 --> 01:26:06,953
of 90 nights...

693
01:26:08,688 --> 01:26:10,622
he had become...

694
01:26:13,026 --> 01:26:16,222
all dry, all white.

695
01:26:16,295 --> 01:26:20,061
Tears streamed from his eyes.

696
01:26:20,132 --> 01:26:22,396
He couldn't hold them back.

697
01:26:22,468 --> 01:26:26,699
He didn't even have
the strength to sleep.

698
01:26:26,771 --> 01:26:32,073
All that time,
the princess watched him.

699
01:26:32,143 --> 01:26:36,943
At long last
it was the 99th night...

700
01:26:37,014 --> 01:26:39,915
and the soldier stood up...

701
01:26:39,983 --> 01:26:42,177
took his chair...

702
01:26:42,251 --> 01:26:43,684
and left.

703
01:26:43,753 --> 01:26:45,687
What? After all that?

704
01:26:47,523 --> 01:26:49,990
After all that.

705
01:26:50,058 --> 01:26:53,050
And don't ask what it means.
I don't know.

706
01:26:55,530 --> 01:26:58,623
If you understand it,
you tell me.

707
01:28:21,339 --> 01:28:23,364
Alfredo, what is it?

708
01:28:23,441 --> 01:28:25,738
I can't.
It's time for Mass.

709
01:28:25,809 --> 01:28:29,506
Father, I need you urgently...

710
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:32,174
because I have doubts...

711
01:28:32,249 --> 01:28:34,546
terrible doubts
tormenting my soul.

712
01:28:34,617 --> 01:28:35,709
Your soul!

713
01:28:42,858 --> 01:28:43,950
Father, I've sinned.

714
01:28:44,026 --> 01:28:45,721
- We can discuss that later.
- But who...

715
01:28:45,794 --> 01:28:47,853
Stay there. Don't move.

716
01:28:47,929 --> 01:28:50,453
Just act normal.
It's Salvatore.

717
01:28:50,531 --> 01:28:52,158
How'd you get in there?

718
01:28:55,736 --> 01:28:58,932
Alfredo, that's
a terrible thing to say.

719
01:28:59,005 --> 01:29:00,666
I know.

720
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:04,005
But take the miracle
of the loaves and fishes.

721
01:29:04,077 --> 01:29:06,477
What about it?

722
01:29:06,545 --> 01:29:10,675
I always wonder:
How is it possible?

723
01:29:10,749 --> 01:29:12,740
All hell broke loose.

724
01:29:12,818 --> 01:29:16,617
My mother told my father.
How could you mistake her for me?

725
01:29:17,155 --> 01:29:19,555
Forgive me, Elena.
I was a real fool.

726
01:29:19,624 --> 01:29:21,956
I had to talk to you.

727
01:29:31,601 --> 01:29:34,034
You're so beautiful, Elena.

728
01:29:34,103 --> 01:29:36,162
That's what I wanted to tell you.

729
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:40,799
When we meet,
I can't say anything right...

730
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:44,367
because you make me tremble.

731
01:29:44,446 --> 01:29:48,473
I don't know what others do
in a case like this.

732
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:50,039
It's my first time.

733
01:29:52,283 --> 01:29:54,513
But I'm in love with you.

734
01:29:54,585 --> 01:29:56,985
Father, I have sinned.

735
01:29:57,054 --> 01:29:59,214
I absolve you
in the name of the Father...

736
01:29:59,289 --> 01:30:00,722
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

737
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:02,724
Go in peace.

738
01:30:07,229 --> 01:30:09,925
When you smile,
you're even prettier.

739
01:30:17,171 --> 01:30:21,972
Salvatore, you're very sweet,
and I like you very much...

740
01:30:22,043 --> 01:30:24,670
but I don't love you.

741
01:30:28,415 --> 01:30:30,679
I don't care.
I'll wait.

742
01:30:30,751 --> 01:30:32,513
What?

743
01:30:32,585 --> 01:30:35,281
Until you fall in love with me.

744
01:30:35,354 --> 01:30:37,288
Now listen.

745
01:30:38,591 --> 01:30:42,822
Every night after work,
I'll come stand outside your house.

746
01:30:42,894 --> 01:30:44,828
And I'll wait. Every night.

747
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:48,922
When you change your mind,
open your window.

748
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,433
That's all.
I'll understand.

749
01:30:51,502 --> 01:30:52,935
You understand now?

750
01:30:53,003 --> 01:30:58,235
Yes, I finally see the light.

751
01:31:01,778 --> 01:31:04,576
Next time, don't talk heresy.

752
01:31:05,815 --> 01:31:07,839
You survived the fire
in the theater...

753
01:31:07,916 --> 01:31:12,410
but no one can save you
from eternal fire!

754
01:32:42,433 --> 01:32:44,424
What's keeping Toto?

755
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:47,961
The theater's closed by now.

756
01:33:08,389 --> 01:33:12,621
<i>Fifteen seconds to the New Year!</i>

757
01:33:13,361 --> 01:33:16,818
14, 13, 12...

758
01:33:31,976 --> 01:33:35,503
I wouldn't worry.
He must be with his friends.

759
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:39,175
- Let's have a toast.
- Happy New Year!

760
01:33:42,052 --> 01:33:44,782
Happy New Year!

761
01:33:45,422 --> 01:33:48,357
- To Toto as well.
- To Toto!

762
01:36:04,512 --> 01:36:06,979
The movie's over!
Turn the lights on!

763
01:36:53,221 --> 01:36:55,781
This is just the test drive.

764
01:37:01,128 --> 01:37:03,221
How'll we get home?

765
01:37:08,401 --> 01:37:11,097
Oh, God, it's my father!

766
01:37:13,172 --> 01:37:14,536
Good evening, Mr. Mendola.

767
01:37:29,687 --> 01:37:31,677
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.</i>

768
01:37:31,754 --> 01:37:36,623
<i>The "Teatro della Fiera" in Milan

770
01:37:45,667 --> 01:37:48,191
<i>What do you know?
I forgot my lines.</i>

771
01:37:49,170 --> 01:37:51,161
You're kidding me, right?

772
01:37:51,239 --> 01:37:54,003
How can you see this "television"
without any film?

773
01:37:54,075 --> 01:37:56,804
- That's the way it works.
- With no film?

774
01:37:57,611 --> 01:38:01,445
And if you buy a television set,
you can watch it at home.

775
01:38:01,515 --> 01:38:03,813
That may be, but I don't like it.

776
01:38:04,251 --> 01:38:06,241
There's something fishy about it.

777
01:38:06,318 --> 01:38:08,013
<i>- Massa...?
- Macinaia.</i>

778
01:38:08,087 --> 01:38:10,078
<i>Massa Macinaia.</i>

779
01:38:10,256 --> 01:38:12,520
<i>It must be close to Massa Carrara.</i>

780
01:38:12,591 --> 01:38:14,581
<i>No. It's near Lucca.</i>

781
01:38:16,094 --> 01:38:18,722
Isn't this a marvelous invention?

782
01:38:18,796 --> 01:38:21,959
But how was I supposed to buy
the equipment without a mortgage?

783
01:38:22,232 --> 01:38:26,692
In this day and age,
one has to keep up with the times.

784
01:38:27,104 --> 01:38:30,232
It's a new machine
called a teleprojector.

786
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:44,617
The Divine Comedy.

787
01:38:45,387 --> 01:38:48,184
Maybe your father
looks down on my job.

788
01:38:48,289 --> 01:38:50,519
Or the fact my family is poor.
Is that it?

789
01:38:54,728 --> 01:38:57,252
As soon as school is out,
we're going to Tuscany.

790
01:38:58,097 --> 01:39:00,691
If you come up there,
we can meet secretly.

791
01:39:01,267 --> 01:39:04,861
I have to work all summer.
What am I going to do without you?

792
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:08,362
Don't worry.
I'll write you every day.

793
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:12,241
I love you. The summer will end,

01:40:06,324 --> 01:40:08,815
Come on in.

798
01:40:08,893 --> 01:40:10,827

799
01:40:43,190 --> 01:40:44,851

01:41:01,073 --> 01:41:03,541
<i>So we won't see each other
every day.</i>

807
01:41:03,609 --> 01:41:06,907
<i>But don't worry.
Whenever I can get away...</i>

808
01:41:06,978 --> 01:41:10,106
<i>I'll come to you
at the Paradiso.</i>

809
01:41:39,907 --> 01:41:42,876
I caught an octopus!

810
01:42:01,693 --> 01:42:03,786
There's a letter for you!

811
01:42:04,196 --> 01:42:07,460
One a day. Here you go.

812
01:42:08,399 --> 01:42:11,027
- You making fun of me?
- Of course!

813
01:42:23,846 --> 01:42:25,973
<i>I'm blind!</i>

814
01:42:48,834 --> 01:42:55,671
<i>By God's might, by man's actions!
Rise up!</i>

815
01:43:22,697 --> 01:43:26,155
When will this rotten summer end?

816
01:43:26,902 --> 01:43:29,632
In a film, it'd already be over.

817
01:43:29,704 --> 01:43:33,503
Fade-out, cut to storm.
Wouldn't that be great?

818
01:43:47,719 --> 01:43:51,155
<i>Tell them I am Ulysses!</i>

819
01:44:02,333 --> 01:44:04,459
Elena! But when...

820
01:44:04,534 --> 01:44:06,263
I got back today.

821
01:44:06,336 --> 01:44:09,533
You can't imagine the excuses
I made up to come here.

822
01:44:42,502 --> 01:44:45,596
You still can't beat Sophia Loren...

823
01:44:45,671 --> 01:44:48,935
with those long legs
and ample breasts.

824
01:44:49,007 --> 01:44:52,135
- Kind of like Lana Turner?
- Don Ciccio?

825
01:44:52,611 --> 01:44:54,875
This is for Toto.

826
01:44:54,946 --> 01:44:57,505
- You give it to him.
- What is it?

827
01:44:59,116 --> 01:45:02,313
Oh, my God!
What am I going to do now?

828
01:45:07,690 --> 01:45:09,681
What did they say?

829
01:45:09,759 --> 01:45:13,956
As a war orphan, I don't fall
under the mandatory draft.

830
01:45:14,029 --> 01:45:16,862
But there's nothing to be done.
They've made a clerical error.

831
01:45:16,932 --> 01:45:19,264
I leave for Rome on Friday.

832
01:45:19,334 --> 01:45:22,029
They said they'd discharge me
after ten days.

833
01:45:22,103 --> 01:45:24,799
- Come.
- No, Salvatore. You'd better go.

834
01:45:24,872 --> 01:45:26,567
My father's here.

835
01:45:26,641 --> 01:45:30,633
Good. Finally we can talk.
This time I'll make him see reason.

836
01:45:31,211 --> 01:45:34,977
I'm afraid not, Salvatore.
He has other plans for me.

837
01:45:36,249 --> 01:45:37,739
Who?

838
01:45:37,817 --> 01:45:40,011
The son of one
of his business partners.

839
01:45:40,085 --> 01:45:42,383
Don't look so sad.
We'll talk about it later.

840
01:45:42,454 --> 01:45:44,479
Wait for me Thursday
at the Paradiso.

841
01:45:44,557 --> 01:45:47,821
I'll be on the 5:00 bus.
I love you.

842
01:46:06,008 --> 01:46:07,669
"Thursday"

843
01:46:12,581 --> 01:46:13,570
"Today"

844
01:46:27,061 --> 01:46:30,962
This film is too highbrow for us.
One day is more than enough.

845
01:46:31,030 --> 01:46:36,024
Load the reels for tomorrow,
ready for the new guy.

846
01:46:36,703 --> 01:46:37,692
All right.

847
01:46:38,670 --> 01:46:41,468
Hey, cheer up!

848
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:44,031
I'll wait for you.
Don't worry.

849
01:46:44,109 --> 01:46:46,043
The job'll still be here.

850
01:46:46,111 --> 01:46:47,839
I'll wait, you hear?

851
01:46:47,912 --> 01:46:49,277
Don't look so gloomy.

852
01:46:49,347 --> 01:46:51,281
Come on, now!

853
01:47:54,004 --> 01:47:56,233
You weren't expecting me,
were you?

854
01:47:57,006 --> 01:48:00,271
No, Alfredo.
I was coming to help you.

855
01:48:00,343 --> 01:48:02,868
No, you were expecting her.

856
01:48:03,879 --> 01:48:05,938
It's no fun to wait alone.

857
01:48:06,148 --> 01:48:08,514
It's easier
if you have company, right?

858
01:48:09,718 --> 01:48:11,686
Would you rather I left?

859
01:48:11,753 --> 01:48:15,711
No, don't go.
Listen, I need your help.

860
01:48:38,776 --> 01:48:43,270
How did he talk me into this?

861
01:49:10,205 --> 01:49:11,331
Open up!

862
01:49:13,073 --> 01:49:14,597
Open the door!

863
01:49:51,473 --> 01:49:53,134
I don't like it!

864
01:50:18,263 --> 01:50:20,321
- I'm back.
- What took you so long?

865
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:23,430
- I'm here now.
- Where did you go?

866
01:50:24,168 --> 01:50:27,228
Calm down. It's all right.
Sit down.

867
01:50:32,275 --> 01:50:34,266
Did she come?

868
01:50:34,811 --> 01:50:36,802
No, no one came.

869
01:50:57,231 --> 01:51:01,031
Radioman Di Vita, 3rd Battalion,
9th Company, sir!

870
01:51:07,874 --> 01:51:10,399
<i>Colonel, I'd like to know
when I'll be discharged.</i>

871
01:51:10,476 --> 01:51:13,501
<i>As yet we have received
no such order. You may go.</i>

872
01:51:20,784 --> 01:51:23,446
They transferred her father?
It can't be!

873
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:26,011
And no one knows where?

874
01:51:26,090 --> 01:51:29,252
Screw you if you won't tell me!
Asshole son of a bitch!

875
01:51:52,013 --> 01:51:54,242
Colonel, I was only supposed
to be here for ten days.

876
01:51:54,314 --> 01:51:56,578
It's been almost a year
and I haven't been home once.

877
01:51:56,650 --> 01:51:59,175
I demand to be sent home
on leave!

878
01:52:23,540 --> 01:52:27,032
Di Vita, get ready.
Your discharge came through.

879
01:54:05,697 --> 01:54:08,222
You're thinner.

880
01:54:08,299 --> 01:54:10,960
I can tell you've been unhappy.

881
01:54:11,035 --> 01:54:13,435
They tell me you never go out...

882
01:54:13,504 --> 01:54:15,438
and you never talk to anybody.

883
01:54:15,506 --> 01:54:17,201
Why?

884
01:54:17,941 --> 01:54:19,874
You know how it is.

885
01:54:20,943 --> 01:54:24,071
Sooner or later a time comes...

886
01:54:24,147 --> 01:54:29,413
when it's all the same
whether you talk or not.

887
01:54:31,186 --> 01:54:33,848
So you might as well shut up.

888
01:54:40,628 --> 01:54:42,562
It's hot in here.

889
01:54:43,798 --> 01:54:45,492
Take me to the sea.

890
01:54:45,565 --> 01:54:49,331
At a party, a lieutenant
pinches this girl's ass.

891
01:54:49,402 --> 01:54:53,304
She turns around.
It's the colonel's daughter.

892
01:54:53,373 --> 01:54:55,135
Terrified, the lieutenant says...

893
01:54:55,207 --> 01:55:00,406
"If your heart is as hard
as what I just felt, I'm a dead man."

894
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:08,284
You haven't seen her?

895
01:55:12,022 --> 01:55:14,456
And no one knows where she is.

896
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:20,151
That's probably how
it was meant to be.

897
01:55:20,229 --> 01:55:24,962
Each of us has his own destiny.

898
01:55:25,034 --> 01:55:28,799
What do you plan to do now?

899
01:55:39,413 --> 01:55:41,074
I've got another one.

900
01:55:41,548 --> 01:55:43,778
The captain says to the sergeant...

901
01:55:44,284 --> 01:55:46,274
"Do you remember...

902
01:55:46,953 --> 01:55:48,944
when there was a windmill there?"

903
01:55:49,856 --> 01:55:51,983
"Yes, Captain, I remember it well."

904
01:55:53,126 --> 01:55:55,355
The windmill is gone now...

905
01:55:55,427 --> 01:55:57,418
but the wind is still there."

906
01:56:06,570 --> 01:56:09,334
Do you remember the story
about the soldier and the princess?

907
01:56:22,151 --> 01:56:25,018
Now I know why the soldier left
after all that time.

908
01:56:30,992 --> 01:56:33,859
One more night
and the princess would be his.

909
01:56:34,829 --> 01:56:38,355
But she might have broken
her promise...

910
01:56:38,431 --> 01:56:40,797
and that would have been terrible.

911
01:56:40,867 --> 01:56:43,233
It would have killed him.

912
01:56:43,303 --> 01:56:46,430
This way, at least,
for 99 nights...

913
01:56:46,505 --> 01:56:49,497
he had lived with the illusion
that she was waiting for him.

914
01:56:51,610 --> 01:56:54,043
Do as the soldier did, Toto.

915
01:56:54,112 --> 01:56:55,943
Get out of here.

916
01:56:56,447 --> 01:56:59,075
This land is cursed.

917
01:56:59,150 --> 01:57:02,118
Living here day after day...

918
01:57:02,186 --> 01:57:05,747
you think
it's the center of the world.

919
01:57:05,822 --> 01:57:09,690
You believe nothing
will ever change.

920
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:13,456
Then you leave
for a year or two.

921
01:57:13,529 --> 01:57:16,123
When you come back,
everything's changed.

922
01:57:16,199 --> 01:57:19,031
The thread's broken.

923
01:57:19,100 --> 01:57:21,830
What you came to find isn't there.

924
01:57:21,903 --> 01:57:23,871
What was yours is gone.

925
01:57:24,072 --> 01:57:27,802
You have to go away
for a long time...

926
01:57:27,875 --> 01:57:30,139
many years...

927
01:57:30,211 --> 01:57:35,274
before you can come back
and find your people.

928
01:57:35,349 --> 01:57:38,784
The land where you were born.

929
01:57:38,851 --> 01:57:41,376
But not now.
It's not possible.

930
01:57:41,454 --> 01:57:44,218
Right now,
you're more blind than I am.

931
01:57:44,290 --> 01:57:48,225
Who said that? Gary Cooper?
James Stewart? Henry Fonda?

932
01:57:48,293 --> 01:57:50,227
No, Toto.

933
01:57:52,531 --> 01:57:54,964
Nobody said it.

934
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:58,664
This time it's all me.

935
01:57:59,937 --> 01:58:03,736
Life isn't like in the movies.

936
01:58:03,807 --> 01:58:06,105
Life...

937
01:58:06,176 --> 01:58:08,110
is much harder.

938
01:58:09,746 --> 01:58:11,838
Get out of here!

939
01:58:11,914 --> 01:58:13,905
Go back to Rome.

940
01:58:13,983 --> 01:58:17,612
You're young,
and the world is yours.

941
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:20,614
And I'm old.

942
01:58:21,422 --> 01:58:24,687
I don't want to hear you
talk anymore.

943
01:58:24,759 --> 01:58:27,192
I want to hear others
talking about you.

944
01:59:59,443 --> 02:00:01,376
Don't come back.

945
02:00:02,611 --> 02:00:04,636
Don't think about us.

946
02:00:04,714 --> 02:00:07,581
Don't look back. Don't write.

947
02:00:07,650 --> 02:00:13,246
Don't give in to nostalgia.
Forget us all.

948
02:00:13,321 --> 02:00:16,654
If you do and you come back,
don't come see me.

949
02:00:16,725 --> 02:00:20,421
I won't let you in my house.
Understand?

950
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:29,334
Thank you.

951
02:00:30,403 --> 02:00:32,837
For everything you've done for me.

952
02:00:35,407 --> 02:00:38,501
Whatever you end up doing,
love it.

953
02:00:40,078 --> 02:00:42,672
The way you loved
the projection booth...

954
02:00:44,248 --> 02:00:46,682
when you were a little squirt.

955
02:00:55,191 --> 02:00:59,389
He's gone.
Toto! Good-bye!

956
02:01:06,001 --> 02:01:08,435
I got here too late.
What a shame!

957
02:02:07,856 --> 02:02:10,881
It's Toto. I knew it.

958
02:02:28,207 --> 02:02:29,868
- Toto.
- How are you?

959
02:02:42,887 --> 02:02:48,017
Your sister will be so glad
to see you. And the children...

960
02:02:48,091 --> 02:02:51,083
You won't recognize them,
they've grown so much.

961
02:02:51,161 --> 02:02:53,321
They always write to say
they want to come and visit.

962
02:02:53,395 --> 02:02:56,296
See how nice the house is?

963
02:02:56,365 --> 02:03:01,563
We had the whole thing redone,
all thanks to you.

964
02:03:01,636 --> 02:03:05,402
I have a surprise for you.
Come.

965
02:03:05,473 --> 02:03:08,135
Are you tired?

966
02:03:08,209 --> 02:03:11,177
You have time to rest
before the funeral.

967
02:03:11,245 --> 02:03:14,840
No, Mama,
it's only an hour by plane.

968
02:03:14,915 --> 02:03:18,748
You shouldn't have said that
after all these years.

969
02:03:18,818 --> 02:03:23,016
Come. I put all your things in here.

970
02:05:10,283 --> 02:05:13,309
He must be glad you came, Toto.

971
02:05:15,321 --> 02:05:18,312
He always talked about you.
Always.

972
02:05:19,858 --> 02:05:22,292
Right up to the end.

973
02:05:27,632 --> 02:05:29,759
He really loved you.

974
02:05:43,712 --> 02:05:46,146
He left something for you.

975
02:05:47,416 --> 02:05:49,577
Before you leave...

976
02:05:49,652 --> 02:05:51,586
come see me.

977
02:07:36,912 --> 02:07:39,608
When did you close it down?

978
02:07:39,682 --> 02:07:44,243
Six years ago in May.
Nobody came anymore.

979
02:07:44,319 --> 02:07:49,347
You know better than I, Mr. Di Vita...
the economy, TV, videos.

980
02:07:49,424 --> 02:07:53,792
The old movie business
is just a memory.

981
02:07:54,528 --> 02:07:58,692
The city bought the site
for a parking lot.

982
02:07:58,766 --> 02:08:02,599
They're demolishing it Saturday.
It's too bad.

983
02:08:04,771 --> 02:08:06,705
What's this "Mr. Di Vita"?

984
02:08:07,774 --> 02:08:09,832
You used to order me around.

985
02:08:09,908 --> 02:08:14,845
Now that you're a big shot,
it's a little different.

986
02:08:14,913 --> 02:08:18,313
But if you insist, Toto.

987
02:08:21,552 --> 02:08:22,985
Excuse me.

988
02:08:28,291 --> 02:08:31,226
Who would've believed it?
Little Toto.

989
02:09:04,290 --> 02:09:07,919
Uncle, next time Grandma goes
to Rome, I want to go too.

990
02:09:07,993 --> 02:09:10,290
I want to see what you do
when you work.

991
02:09:10,829 --> 02:09:13,593
Fine, but I have to tell you,
there's not much to see.

992
02:09:14,032 --> 02:09:16,592
I sell a lot of smoke
and very little substance.

993
02:09:18,535 --> 02:09:20,196
Watch out, Salvatore.

994
02:09:20,270 --> 02:09:22,465
Don't let them take
advantage of you.

995
02:09:22,539 --> 02:09:26,065
These two will eat you alive.

996
02:09:27,910 --> 02:09:29,707
Uncle, are you leaving tomorrow?

997
02:09:32,281 --> 02:09:35,613
I don't know.
I don't know, Filippo.

998
02:09:36,718 --> 02:09:38,379
I really don't know.

999
02:09:58,037 --> 02:09:59,526
It must be for you.

1000
02:09:59,605 --> 02:10:02,199
They've been calling all afternoon.

1001
02:10:02,274 --> 02:10:04,640
They want to know
whether you're leaving tonight...

1002
02:10:04,943 --> 02:10:06,274
or tomorrow.

1003
02:10:16,087 --> 02:10:17,576
Go on in.

1004
02:13:25,019 --> 02:13:26,850
A double whiskey, please.

1005
02:13:29,957 --> 02:13:31,686
Do you think that's him?

1006
02:13:37,531 --> 02:13:40,125
Excuse me, are you Dr. Lenera?

1007
02:13:41,568 --> 02:13:43,467
I'm a big fan.

1008
02:13:48,274 --> 02:13:50,105
Thank you.

1009
02:14:55,233 --> 02:14:57,064
- Miss?
- Yes?

1010
02:15:04,875 --> 02:15:08,139
I'm sorry.
I mistook you for someone else.

1011
02:16:27,847 --> 02:16:30,145
I always have to call you.

1012
02:16:30,217 --> 02:16:32,208
Why right now?

1013
02:16:32,285 --> 02:16:35,845
You were supposed
to pick me up at noon.

1014
02:16:36,255 --> 02:16:39,247
Forget it. I'm not coming.

1015
02:16:39,325 --> 02:16:41,986
You know what?
I'll go by myself.

1016
02:17:29,569 --> 02:17:31,503
What are you thinking?

1017
02:17:35,340 --> 02:17:39,800
I was thinking that you and I
have never spoken, Mama.

1018
02:17:43,047 --> 02:17:46,483
When I was little,
I saw you...

1019
02:17:48,052 --> 02:17:50,110
as an old woman already.

1020
02:17:51,388 --> 02:17:53,583
Maybe it's the same for all children.
Who knows?

1021
02:18:03,732 --> 02:18:06,166
Only now do I realize...

1022
02:18:07,702 --> 02:18:09,897
that you were young...

1023
02:18:10,605 --> 02:18:12,334
and beautiful.

1024
02:18:13,541 --> 02:18:15,872
You had your whole life
ahead of you.

1025
02:18:17,844 --> 02:18:22,008
How have you managed
to live alone all this time...

1026
02:18:23,450 --> 02:18:25,747
with no one to think of you?

1027
02:18:27,219 --> 02:18:29,210
You could have remarried.

1028
02:18:30,289 --> 02:18:32,120
Why not?

1029
02:18:34,359 --> 02:18:37,522
It's possible that back then
I wouldn't have understood.

1030
02:18:38,396 --> 02:18:41,262
But eventually I would have.

1031
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:46,065
I never had anyone,
if that's what you're thinking.

1032
02:18:46,770 --> 02:18:48,897
It was my choice not to.

1033
02:18:48,972 --> 02:18:52,236
I remained faithful
first to your father...

1034
02:18:52,308 --> 02:18:54,708
and later to you and Lia.

1035
02:18:55,496 --> 02:18:58,556
That's the way I am.
I can't help it.

1036
02:18:59,333 --> 02:19:02,302
And you're a lot like me.

1037
02:19:02,369 --> 02:19:04,860
You're far too attached
to your things.

1038
02:19:05,839 --> 02:19:08,899
I don't know
if it's a good thing.

1039
02:19:09,276 --> 02:19:13,336
Loyalty is hard.

1040
02:19:13,413 --> 02:19:16,576
If you're loyal,
you're forever alone.

1041
02:19:23,923 --> 02:19:25,584
I shouldn't have called you.

1042
02:19:27,927 --> 02:19:30,259
It's not your fault, Mama.

1043
02:19:30,597 --> 02:19:35,261
It's just that I've always been
afraid to come back.

1044
02:19:36,469 --> 02:19:41,463
And now, after all these years,
I thought I was stronger...

1045
02:19:42,408 --> 02:19:44,842
that I'd forgotten
a lot of things.

1046
02:19:45,744 --> 02:19:48,372
But in fact...

1047
02:19:49,281 --> 02:19:51,772
I find I'm right back
where I was...

1048
02:19:51,850 --> 02:19:54,614
as if I'd never been away.

1049
02:19:56,622 --> 02:19:59,557
And yet I look at Lia
and feel that I don't even know her.

1050
02:20:03,528 --> 02:20:05,462
And you, Mama...

1051
02:20:06,798 --> 02:20:08,732
I deserted you.

1052
02:20:09,901 --> 02:20:12,028
Ran out on you like a bandit...

1053
02:20:12,104 --> 02:20:14,197
without any explanation.

1054
02:20:14,273 --> 02:20:16,002
I never asked for any.

1055
02:20:16,074 --> 02:20:18,564
You don't have to explain
anything to me.

1056
02:20:18,643 --> 02:20:23,137
I always thought you did
what was right. Why dwell on it?

1057
02:20:24,749 --> 02:20:26,842
Only one thing caused me pain.

1058
02:20:26,917 --> 02:20:31,616
When I used to bolt
the door at night...

1059
02:20:31,689 --> 02:20:33,486
before going to bed...

1060
02:20:35,159 --> 02:20:37,491
You never used to do that.

1061
02:20:39,196 --> 02:20:42,632
When you worked nights
at the theater...

1062
02:20:42,700 --> 02:20:47,694
I couldn't fall asleep
until you came home.

1063
02:20:48,939 --> 02:20:51,873
When you finally came in...

1064
02:20:52,509 --> 02:20:54,977
I'd pretend to be asleep.

1065
02:20:55,278 --> 02:20:57,974
But I'd hear you
moving around the house.

1066
02:20:58,048 --> 02:21:00,676
Then, when you'd fall asleep...

1067
02:21:00,750 --> 02:21:05,187
I'd get up and bolt the door.

1068
02:21:07,057 --> 02:21:11,050
After you left...

1069
02:21:11,594 --> 02:21:14,085
every time I did it...

1070
02:21:14,164 --> 02:21:17,224
it felt as if I were leaving
someone outside the door.

1071
02:21:19,202 --> 02:21:20,863
Far away.

1072
02:21:22,205 --> 02:21:24,468
You were right to leave.

1073
02:21:24,540 --> 02:21:27,373
You did what you wanted to do.

1074
02:21:29,678 --> 02:21:33,671
Every time I call you,
a different woman answers.

1075
02:21:33,749 --> 02:21:36,684
I pretend to recognize them...

1076
02:21:36,752 --> 02:21:40,882
to save them the embarrassment
of an introduction.

1077
02:21:41,590 --> 02:21:45,617
I'm sure they must think
I'm a crazy old woman.

1078
02:21:47,896 --> 02:21:51,627
But I never heard
in any of their voices...

1079
02:21:51,700 --> 02:21:53,827
that they really loved you.

1080
02:21:53,902 --> 02:21:55,802
I would've known.

1081
02:21:55,871 --> 02:21:58,395
All the same, I'd have liked...

1082
02:21:58,473 --> 02:22:02,910
to see you settled down...

1083
02:22:02,977 --> 02:22:04,911
in love with someone.

1084
02:22:06,214 --> 02:22:08,375
But your life is there.

1085
02:22:08,449 --> 02:22:11,543
Here there are only ghosts.

1086
02:22:11,619 --> 02:22:13,382
Let go, Toto.

1087
02:23:17,450 --> 02:23:19,145
Boccia!

1088
02:23:38,036 --> 02:23:39,867
<i>Hello.</i>

1089
02:24:27,651 --> 02:24:29,642
<i>Hello. Who is it?</i>

1090
02:24:33,613 --> 02:24:36,047
I'd like to speak
to Elena, please.

1091
02:24:36,116 --> 02:24:38,379
<i>Speaking.</i>

1092
02:24:38,684 --> 02:24:40,675
<i>Who is it?</i>

1093
02:24:42,788 --> 02:24:44,619
Salvatore.

1094
02:24:47,291 --> 02:24:51,591
<i>Salvatore... who?</i>

1095
02:24:54,698 --> 02:24:58,134
Di Vita. This is Salvatore Di Vita.

1096
02:25:00,804 --> 02:25:02,465
Do you remember?

1097
02:25:03,706 --> 02:25:06,334
I'm across the street
from your house.

1098
02:25:06,742 --> 02:25:08,710
Right here, Elena.

1099
02:25:20,788 --> 02:25:22,779
<i>Of course I remember.</i>

1100
02:25:27,027 --> 02:25:29,153
I'd like to see you, Elena.

1101
02:25:29,595 --> 02:25:31,563
Let's meet.

1102
02:25:32,832 --> 02:25:35,130
<i>It was so long ago.</i>

1103
02:25:35,601 --> 02:25:37,727
<i>Why should we meet?</i>

1104
02:25:38,804 --> 02:25:40,669
<i>What good would it do?</i>

1105
02:25:41,440 --> 02:25:43,431
Please, don't say no.

1106
02:25:44,509 --> 02:25:47,875
<i>I'm old, Salvatore, and so are you.</i>

1107
02:25:48,612 --> 02:25:50,637
<i>It's better
not to see each other.</i>

1108
02:25:52,049 --> 02:25:54,346
<i>Good-bye.</i>

1109
02:28:02,030 --> 02:28:03,691
How did you know I'd be here?

1110
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:09,496
I don't know how long it's been,
but there are things I remember.

1111
02:28:11,004 --> 02:28:13,598
There weren't many places
to choose from.

1112
02:28:16,676 --> 02:28:18,769
I looked for you.

1113
02:28:37,394 --> 02:28:39,589
You're still beautiful.

1114
02:28:42,832 --> 02:28:46,461
What are you talking about?
I'm old.

1115
02:28:51,573 --> 02:28:53,905
Please don't look at me that way.

1116
02:28:57,778 --> 02:28:59,939
Why did you come back?

1117
02:29:01,182 --> 02:29:03,173
Alfredo died.

1118
02:29:03,885 --> 02:29:05,374
Do you remember him?

1119
02:29:07,187 --> 02:29:09,178
Of course I remember him.

1120
02:29:09,856 --> 02:29:11,517
I'm sorry.

1121
02:29:14,159 --> 02:29:16,150
You loved him very much.

1122
02:29:19,031 --> 02:29:21,090
I saw your daughter.

1123
02:29:22,100 --> 02:29:24,091
She's very beautiful.

1124
02:29:26,371 --> 02:29:28,430
I bet there are many Salvatores
running after her.

1125
02:29:30,774 --> 02:29:32,264
A few.

1126
02:29:33,944 --> 02:29:36,504
But there aren't many like you.

1127
02:29:40,750 --> 02:29:44,151
I also have a son.
He's older.

1128
02:29:46,955 --> 02:29:49,651
- And you?
- No children.

1129
02:29:49,891 --> 02:29:51,882
I'm not married.

1130
02:29:55,130 --> 02:29:56,323
Are you happy?

1131
02:29:57,498 --> 02:29:59,159
All things considered, yes.

1132
02:30:01,602 --> 02:30:04,866
Although it wasn't
what I dreamt of at the time.

1133
02:30:07,507 --> 02:30:09,566
You know my husband, don't you?

1134
02:30:13,111 --> 02:30:15,102
Sure I do. Boccia.
I remember him well.

1135
02:30:17,649 --> 02:30:21,209
What does he do in life?

1136
02:30:22,687 --> 02:30:24,177
He's in politics.

1137
02:30:25,389 --> 02:30:27,323
He's a regional delegate.

1138
02:30:29,793 --> 02:30:32,887
We met up again
at the University of Pisa.

1139
02:30:35,598 --> 02:30:38,623
Why didn't you marry the man
your father had chosen?

1140
02:30:38,701 --> 02:30:40,669
I didn't want to.

1141
02:30:40,736 --> 02:30:42,397
And in the end, I won.

1142
02:30:48,409 --> 02:30:50,877
Back then I was waiting for you.

1143
02:30:57,250 --> 02:31:01,050
But I never forgot you. Ever.

1144
02:31:01,722 --> 02:31:03,712
Neither did I.

1145
02:31:05,458 --> 02:31:07,949
Even though you disappeared.

1146
02:31:12,230 --> 02:31:14,630
But why talk about it now?

1147
02:31:20,471 --> 02:31:23,372
We'll just end up looking pathetic
and ridiculous.

1148
02:31:24,408 --> 02:31:25,739
Do you still live in Rome?

1149
02:31:25,809 --> 02:31:27,799
What are you talking about?

1150
02:31:29,012 --> 02:31:32,675
The last time we spoke, we made
a date to meet at the Paradiso.

1151
02:31:32,749 --> 02:31:36,411
You never showed up!
You disappeared without a trace!

1152
02:31:36,485 --> 02:31:40,182
How many years have gone by?
More than 30!

1153
02:31:45,326 --> 02:31:49,353
I did show up for that date.

1154
02:31:58,271 --> 02:32:00,738
But I was late.

1155
02:32:02,374 --> 02:32:04,740
I had had a long fight
with my parents.

1156
02:32:07,479 --> 02:32:11,209
I had tried to convince them
that they couldn't separate us.

1157
02:32:13,284 --> 02:32:15,445
But it was no use.

1158
02:32:17,788 --> 02:32:19,619
They had decided...

1159
02:32:20,824 --> 02:32:23,816
to leave Sicily once and for all.

1160
02:32:26,195 --> 02:32:28,254
And we did.

1161
02:32:29,932 --> 02:32:33,698
I didn't know what else to do,
what else to say.

1162
02:32:35,670 --> 02:32:38,036
So I said yes.

1163
02:32:38,673 --> 02:32:41,403
I would do as they wished.

1164
02:32:43,277 --> 02:32:45,268
In exchange,
my father agreed...

1165
02:32:45,345 --> 02:32:48,439
to let me see you one last time
to say good-bye.

1166
02:32:50,451 --> 02:32:52,509
I was hoping...

1167
02:32:53,486 --> 02:32:58,185
that we would use that time
to come up with a plan.

1168
02:33:00,258 --> 02:33:02,522
I thought we would...

1169
02:33:04,162 --> 02:33:06,187
run away together.

1170
02:33:12,603 --> 02:33:14,867
My father drove me
to the theater.

1171
02:33:14,939 --> 02:33:17,964
But Alfredo was in the booth,
not you.

1172
02:33:21,077 --> 02:33:24,842
<i>I couldn't wait
for you to get back.</i>

1173
02:33:27,249 --> 02:33:29,274
Hurry up, Elena.

1174
02:33:29,351 --> 02:33:31,717
<i>So I explained
the situation to Alfredo.</i>

1175
02:33:32,254 --> 02:33:34,653
<i>I told him I was leaving
that very night.</i>

1176
02:33:34,889 --> 02:33:37,119
<i>I begged him
to tell you everything.</i>

1177
02:33:39,093 --> 02:33:41,583
<i>He was very nice to me.</i>

1178
02:33:43,163 --> 02:33:44,653
<i>He listened...</i>

1179
02:33:45,465 --> 02:33:47,228
<i>very carefully.</i>

1180
02:33:49,101 --> 02:33:51,365
Calm down.

1181
02:33:51,437 --> 02:33:53,098
Don't cry.

1182
02:33:54,473 --> 02:33:56,771
Now you listen to me.

1183
02:33:57,276 --> 02:34:00,301
If you want me to tell Toto
all that you told me...

1184
02:34:00,378 --> 02:34:02,346
I will.

1185
02:34:02,413 --> 02:34:05,007
But if you want my advice...

1186
02:34:05,083 --> 02:34:06,572
forget about him.

1187
02:34:07,151 --> 02:34:10,018
It would be better for both of you
not to see each other.

1188
02:34:10,888 --> 02:34:12,378
My child...

1189
02:34:12,856 --> 02:34:17,189
fire always turns to ashes.

1190
02:34:17,593 --> 02:34:21,222
Even the greatest love
comes to an end...

1191
02:34:21,297 --> 02:34:25,858
and many other loves come
to take its place.

1192
02:34:25,934 --> 02:34:28,664
But Toto has only one future.

1193
02:34:29,471 --> 02:34:33,429
He can't see it now. I tell him,
but he doesn't believe me.

1194
02:34:34,008 --> 02:34:36,203
He might even kill me.

1195
02:34:38,212 --> 02:34:41,578
But you can understand it.

1196
02:34:42,382 --> 02:34:44,441
<i>You must understand it.</i>

1197
02:34:44,918 --> 02:34:46,579
Do it for him.

1198
02:35:04,834 --> 02:35:07,962
It's a secret I would rather
not even have told you.

1199
02:35:16,278 --> 02:35:18,371
Damn Alfredo!

1200
02:35:20,915 --> 02:35:22,940
He fooled even you.

1201
02:35:25,386 --> 02:35:28,082
I told him
I would take his advice.

1202
02:35:28,156 --> 02:35:30,680
But before I left,
I wrote you that note.

1203
02:35:42,668 --> 02:35:44,795
I was going down the stairs...

1204
02:35:46,638 --> 02:35:49,801
<i>and I figured
that Alfredo couldn't see me.</i>

1205
02:35:51,876 --> 02:35:53,867
<i>So I went back.</i>

1206
02:35:56,113 --> 02:36:00,550
<i>He sat there motionless
at the projector.</i>

1207
02:36:01,852 --> 02:36:04,752
<i>I took one of those slips of paper
off the wall...</i>

1208
02:36:06,889 --> 02:36:09,380
<i>and wrote down the address
where you could find me...</i>

1209
02:36:11,860 --> 02:36:14,226
<i>and that I would wait for you.</i>

1210
02:36:18,367 --> 02:36:20,926
But you disappeared anyway.

1211
02:36:31,244 --> 02:36:34,042
How I looked for you, Elena!

1212
02:36:36,749 --> 02:36:38,740
You have no idea.

1213
02:36:40,319 --> 02:36:42,787
I wrote, I called. Nothing.

1214
02:36:45,056 --> 02:36:47,547
No one ever answered.

1215
02:36:51,396 --> 02:36:53,829
That's why I ran away.

1216
02:36:57,434 --> 02:36:59,732
And why I never came back here.

1217
02:37:02,271 --> 02:37:04,262
But I dreamt of you for years.

1218
02:37:16,618 --> 02:37:18,812
Even though years passed...

1219
02:37:19,820 --> 02:37:22,380
in every woman I met...

1220
02:37:22,990 --> 02:37:25,356
I sought only you.

1221
02:37:26,859 --> 02:37:31,319
I've been very lucky in my career,
it's true.

1222
02:37:35,300 --> 02:37:37,530
But something was always missing.

1223
02:37:41,039 --> 02:37:43,404
I never would have dreamt that...

1224
02:37:43,507 --> 02:37:46,408
everything would end...

1225
02:37:47,511 --> 02:37:50,309
because of the man
who was a father to me.

1226
02:37:51,948 --> 02:37:53,279
That madman.

1227
02:37:54,351 --> 02:37:58,048
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning
I think I hated him too.

1228
02:37:58,855 --> 02:38:00,788
But in time...

1229
02:38:01,990 --> 02:38:04,220
I understood his words...

1230
02:38:06,261 --> 02:38:08,660
and also your silence.

1231
02:38:10,398 --> 02:38:12,491
I never found that note.

1232
02:38:14,869 --> 02:38:16,859
I covered it up
with my own two hands.

1233
02:38:19,272 --> 02:38:22,901
I didn't see it.
It's the only absurd explanation.

1234
02:38:22,976 --> 02:38:25,876
What does it matter now
whether we find the reason?

1235
02:38:27,413 --> 02:38:29,404
What's done is done.

1236
02:38:30,750 --> 02:38:33,240
But Alfredo didn't betray you.

1237
02:38:33,318 --> 02:38:35,980
He was the only one
who truly understood you.

1238
02:38:37,275 --> 02:38:38,935
Salvatore...

1239
02:38:39,510 --> 02:38:42,569
if you had chosen to stay with me,
you wouldn't have made your movies...

1240
02:38:42,645 --> 02:38:44,839
and that would have been
a shame.

1241
02:38:44,913 --> 02:38:47,472
They're wonderful.

1242
02:38:47,548 --> 02:38:49,539
I've seen them all.

1243
02:38:51,985 --> 02:38:54,646
But you never should have changed
your name.

1244
02:38:56,320 --> 02:38:58,311
You should have kept your name.

1245
02:38:59,256 --> 02:39:01,087
Salvatore Di Vita.

1246
02:40:13,438 --> 02:40:16,406
These are the things
he left for you.

1247
02:40:31,083 --> 02:40:36,280
When they showed your films
on television...

1248
02:40:36,353 --> 02:40:38,013
he was happy.

1249
02:40:39,755 --> 02:40:44,315
He'd sit in front of it
and forget all his troubles.

1250
02:40:47,093 --> 02:40:50,755
He knew all the words by heart...

1251
02:40:50,829 --> 02:40:54,423
and I would tell him
what I saw.

1252
02:40:54,498 --> 02:40:57,227
And when the papers
talked about you...

1253
02:40:57,300 --> 02:41:00,132
I'd have to read them to him
two or three times.

1254
02:41:04,805 --> 02:41:09,207
- He never asked to see me?
- No, never.

1255
02:41:11,242 --> 02:41:14,335
Once your mother said to him...

1256
02:41:14,411 --> 02:41:17,641
that you'd surely come
if you wanted him to.

1257
02:41:19,014 --> 02:41:21,743
He was furious and said...

1258
02:41:21,816 --> 02:41:26,377
"No, Toto must never come back
to Giancaldo!"

1259
02:41:29,288 --> 02:41:31,721
He didn't say it to be mean.

1260
02:41:31,789 --> 02:41:33,881
He was a good man.

1261
02:41:35,158 --> 02:41:39,115
Who knows what was going
through his head?

1262
02:41:39,194 --> 02:41:43,391
Towards the end,
he started saying strange things.

1263
02:41:46,032 --> 02:41:50,229
A moment before
he closed his eyes...

1264
02:41:50,302 --> 02:41:54,634
he told your mother
she mustn't let you know.

1265
02:42:08,446 --> 02:42:11,073
1977, '78...

1266

<i>Moby Dick.</i>

<i>Dreams in a Drawer.</i>

02:42:45,171 --> 02:42:46,831
<i>The Challenge.</i>

"Salvatore...

1273
02:43:15,123 --> 02:43:16,920
forgive me.

1274
02:43:18,526 --> 02:43:20,925
When I see you,
I'll explain what happened.

1275
02:43:21,961 --> 02:43:25,327
It was terrible
not to find you here.

1276
02:43:25,397 --> 02:43:31,356
I'm afraid I'll be leaving tonight
for Tuscany with my mother.

1277
02:43:32,535 --> 02:43:34,196
We're moving there.

1278
02:43:35,570 --> 02:43:39,437
But I love only you.

1279
02:43:39,506 --> 02:43:42,668
I'll never be with another man.
I swear it.

1280
02:43:44,810 --> 02:43:49,371
I'm leaving you the address
of a friend where you can write me.

1281
02:43:51,748 --> 02:43:53,738
Don't give up on me.

1282
02:43:56,417 --> 02:43:58,509
Sealed with a kiss...

1283
02:44:00,087 --> 02:44:02,247
Your Elena."

1284
02:44:05,890 --> 02:44:07,880
<i>When are you leaving?</i>

1285
02:44:09,560 --> 02:44:11,390
This afternoon.

1286
02:44:12,794 --> 02:44:16,456
Elena, perhaps in the future
we could...

1287
02:44:16,530 --> 02:44:19,464
No, Salvatore, there is no future.

1288
02:44:19,899 --> 02:44:21,889
There is only the past.

1289
02:44:23,368 --> 02:44:25,961
Even last night's encounter
was just a dream.

1290
02:44:26,571 --> 02:44:28,663
A wonderful dream.

1291
02:44:30,873 --> 02:44:33,363
When we were young,
we never did it.

1292
02:44:34,509 --> 02:44:35,669
Do you remember?

1293
02:44:38,878 --> 02:44:42,313
<i>Now that it has happened,
I can't imagine a better ending.</i>

1294
02:44:49,562 --> 02:44:51,890
I'll never agree with you.

1295
02:44:53,059 --> 02:44:54,886
Never.

1296
02:46:37,571 --> 02:46:41,590
It's my square.
The square is mine.

1297
02:47:06,180 --> 02:47:09,076
Check the leader.
Roll when you're ready.

1298
02:47:09,143 --> 02:47:13,038
- I liked your film. It was terrific.
- Thanks.

1299
02:47:14,440 --> 02:47:17,891
The distributor is moving up
the release date.

1300
02:47:18,136 --> 02:47:20,327
The press conference
is this afternoon.

1301
02:47:20,401 --> 02:47:23,058
The actors will be there,
as well as the producer.

1302
02:47:23,132 --> 02:47:25,255
We just got official confirmation
of the award...

1303
02:47:25,331 --> 02:47:27,851
but we've already received
loads of telegrams.

1304
02:47:28,861 --> 02:47:30,758
Aren't you happy?

1305
02:47:31,625 --> 02:47:34,350
Sure, fine.
We can discuss it later.
