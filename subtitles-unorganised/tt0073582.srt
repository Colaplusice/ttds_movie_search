1
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:36,368
Okay, okay, stop.

2
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:39,030
Great!

3
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:43,969
Really...

4
00:02:45,278 --> 00:02:47,178
...really, that's good. Very good.

5
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:49,972
Maybe a little too good.

6
00:02:50,183 --> 00:02:53,550
Too clean. Yes, too precise. Too...

7
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:56,883
...formal.
It should be more... trashy.

8
00:02:58,225 --> 00:02:59,783
See what I mean?

9
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:03,560
Remember that this sort of Jazz
came out of the...

10
00:03:03,763 --> 00:03:06,630
...the brothels... and the freedom
inspired from...

11
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:09,065
Parapsychology Conference

12
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:13,630
...and this phenomenon,
as the latest studies confirm...

13
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:16,742
...is not restricted to superior species...

14
00:03:16,843 --> 00:03:19,676
...but it includes vertebrates and
invertebrates as well...

15
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,470
Butterflies...

16
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:24,046
...termites, zebras...

17
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,675
...all these animals, and many more...

18
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:32,315
...use telepathy to transmit orders
and relay information.

19
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:36,628
This is a proven fact
that can be easily demonstrated.

20
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,064
For instance: if we put a butterfly
in a cage, within a few hours...

21
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:46,737
...it will be able to gather around it
many other butterflies...

22
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:51,844
...which will quickly swarm in,
in answer to its call...

23
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:55,573
...even covering a distance of
several miles.

24
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:57,615
This is telepathy.

25
00:03:58,285 --> 00:04:02,688
A faculty which comes naturally to the
newborn in the early stages of life...

26
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:06,657
...but which they generally lose
as they acquire the means of...

27
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:08,892
...verbal communication.

28
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:11,692
On the other hand,
certain rare individuals...

29
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:15,666
...for reasons as yet unknown to us,
do not lose this faculty.

30
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:19,034
One such exception is Mrs. Helga Ulman...

31
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,438
...who's here in Italy for
a round of conferences.

32
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:25,610
Helga has extraordinary
telepathic powers...

33
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:29,476
...and her natural bent for the
paranormal has just amazed us.

34
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,575
I will let her tell you herself.
Helga Ulman.

35
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:35,377
I would like to point out immediately...

36
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:39,853
...that my faculties have nothing
whatsoever to do with magic...

37
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:44,157
...the esoteric, or fortune-telling.

38
00:04:44,798 --> 00:04:49,167
I pick up facts the very moment they
occur or have occurred...

39
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:52,299
...but nothing of what is to come.

40
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,239
I can feel thoughts,
the very instant they are formed.

41
00:04:56,343 --> 00:04:58,903
Some I can even sense
a long time afterwards...

42
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:00,707
...because they are so strong.

43
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:04,613
They linger about the room...

44
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:07,245
...like cobwebs.

45
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:14,585
You, sir...

46
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:22,626
Yes you, in the third row,
with your right hand in your pocket.

47
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:27,095
You're clutching a bunch of keys.

48
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:31,569
Four keys... one of them very long.

49
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,881
It's true, look, they're right here!

50
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,742
Your name is Pietro... Pietro...

51
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:45,381
...forgive my pronunciation... Valgoi?

52
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:47,249
Yes, Valgoi, that's right.

53
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,818
Mr. Valgoi, excuse me,
may I ask you something?

54
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:53,256
Do you know Ms. Ulman by any chance?

55
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:54,390
No.

56
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:56,230
Pardon my persistence...

57
00:05:56,403 --> 00:06:00,271
...is it possible you could have met
her before and told her your name?

58
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:06,141
No, how could I? I live in Bologna and
I only arrived in Rome three hours ago!

59
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:08,743
It's absolutely impossible.

60
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:10,816
Good, thank you, sir.

61
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:13,981
No... no!

62
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:17,579
Out! Out! No!
Via! Via! No!

63
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,327
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:28,199
Forgive me.

65
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:32,536
There is something...

66
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:35,640
...someone...

67
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,770
No, I don't know what it is...
Forgive me. I'm sorry.

68
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:43,243
Helga?

69
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,581
It was... I can't explain.

70
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:52,582
Something strange and sharp,
like a knife...

71
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:55,791
...entering my flesh.

72
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,732
Please forgive me,
but it's alright now, thank you.

73
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:07,629
I feel it again.

74
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:13,173
It's here. I can feel death.

75
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:20,185
I feel... a presence.

76
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:27,482
I have entered into contact
with a perverse mind!

77
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:32,924
Its thoughts are of death.

78
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:34,464
Go away!

79
00:07:39,272 --> 00:07:40,261
You...

80
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:43,299
...have killed...

81
00:07:44,477 --> 00:07:46,877
...and you will kill again!

82
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:53,547
That nursery rhyme...

83
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:56,855
...and that house down there...

84
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:00,186
...and the...

85
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:03,761
...death.

86
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:06,061
And that blood!

87
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:09,428
I'm scared, I'm scared!

88
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:12,835
Ms. Ulman! Helga, it's alright!
Calm down, that's enough!

89
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:17,241
Yes, let's hide everything,
everything in the house...

90
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,778
...as if nothing happened.
Back the way it was.

91
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,507
No one must know,
no one must find out, no one!

92
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:26,713
Just forget... forget everything...

93
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:31,120
...forever... forever.

94
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:06,319
Are you okay?

95
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:10,754
Anything I can do for you?
Get some help?

96
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:24,474
It was all so clear, believe me,
so frightfully clear.

97
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:28,414
Like a thorn piercing my brain.

98
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:31,482
I heard his twisted thoughts...

99
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:35,954
...cruel and yet childish
at the same time...

100
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:37,311
How odd.

101
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:39,516
Before, in front of the audience...

102
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:43,187
... I couldn't express all the
sensations that crowded my mind.

103
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,521
...but tonight at home
I'll write them all down.

104
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:48,862
I'll let you have it tomorrow.

105
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:52,371
You may use it as you see fit.

106
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:54,373
I'm saying this because...

107
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,236
...you see... now...

108
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:00,304
... I also know who that person is.

109
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:15,319
- What is it? What's the matter?
- No, it's nothing.

110
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:20,989
Those evil thoughts must be here
stagnating in this room.

111
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:24,469
Just a moment ago it came back to me.

112
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:29,801
I must admit I'm frightened...
I'm really frightened.

113
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:12,075
I don't feel like it...
Non me la sento...

114
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:16,079
...and I really need some rest...
...ed ho bisogno di riposare...

115
00:12:16,182 --> 00:12:18,275
... I feel very tired.
...mi sento molto stanca.

116
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:25,456
So...
Allora...

117
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:29,257
Shouldn't we talk about that right away?
Non pensi che dovremmo parlarne subito?

118
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:39,497
...while I'm still in Italy.
...mentre sono in Italia.

119
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:43,903
Yes...
Si...

120
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:47,045
I am alone.
Sono sola.

121
00:13:14,307 --> 00:13:15,774
...but don't worry.
...ma non preoccuparti.

122
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:22,305
We'll talk again tomorrow?
Ne parliamo ancora domani?

123
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:12,754
Hinno, Marc!

124
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:17,960
Hinno? What does that mean?

125
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:20,198
What are you talking about?

126
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,633
A client just said it to me, in the bar.

127
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,431
He said it's a Tahitian word.

128
00:15:28,975 --> 00:15:30,704
Or was it Madagascar?

129
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:39,275
I'm so damn drunk,
I can't even remember!

130
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:44,213
Anyway, it means...

131
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:50,659
..."alla salute!", "cheers",
"a votre sante", "skol!"

132
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:55,963
Listen, Carlo, when I was in America...

133
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:58,026
... I met a lot of people like you.

134
00:15:58,137 --> 00:16:02,369
Heavy drinkers...
they don't last long, you know?

135
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:04,769
Who says I want to last?

136
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:09,707
You're speaking like a true masochist.
You obviously have the vocation.

137
00:16:11,217 --> 00:16:13,811
Definitely not a masochist,
on the contrary.

138
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:16,487
You know...

139
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:23,795
...as long as I'm drunk...

140
00:16:25,398 --> 00:16:27,263
... I'm as happy as a lark!

141
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:30,329
And I play better too!

142
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:36,439
I mean, the piano is like
the body of a beautiful woman...

143
00:16:37,943 --> 00:16:40,309
...and I tickle her.

144
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:47,913
Cut it out!

145
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,991
Speaking of pianos,
my half hour of fresh air is up.

146
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:59,458
I'll go back in to bang out
a few more notes.

147
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:02,830
Otherwise, I won't get paid tonight.

148
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:04,893
On your feet then, up!

149
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:10,708
You know what, Marc?

150
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:15,372
The difference between you and me
is purely political.

151
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:20,115
You see, we both play rather well.

152
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,823
But I am the proletarian of the pianoforte...

153
00:17:28,561 --> 00:17:31,655
...while you are the bourgeois!

154
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:36,835
You play for the sake of art
and you enjoy it.

155
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:39,327
I play for a living.

156
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:42,498
It's not the same thing.

157
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:47,972
My, my, my! One of your
philosophies I wasn't aware of yet!

158
00:17:48,447 --> 00:17:53,908
Actually, I just thought of it! You know,
I'm really sharp when I'm drunk!

159
00:17:58,758 --> 00:17:59,918
What was that?

160
00:18:03,662 --> 00:18:05,425
A scream, I'd say.

161
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:10,797
Who knows, maybe rape.

162
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:17,673
I drink to you, deflowered virgin!

163
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:31,954
Bye, Marc.

164
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:36,191
- Bye.
- Bye.

165
00:20:01,814 --> 00:20:04,578
Five fatal blows, twelve wounds.

166
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:08,050
Probably from a hatchet
or a butcher's cleaver.

167
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:12,384
The victim seems to be about
35-40 years old.

168
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,359
She has abrasions and cuts
all over her body.

169
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:22,126
So, you are a foreigner, then?

170
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:24,696
Yes, I was born in London but I lived...

171
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:26,998
...several years in America,
before coming here.

172
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:32,141
And what are you doing in Italy?

173
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:36,843
I am a pianist. Jazz.
I teach here at the Conservatory.

174
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:40,352
- I teach Jazz.
- And you play the piano, right?

175
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:46,549
So, in that case,
you don't have any job, right?

176
00:20:47,192 --> 00:20:52,061
- I told you that I am a pianist.
- Hmm, sure, sure...

177
00:20:52,164 --> 00:20:55,759
Yes, in short, that's your only job.

178
00:20:55,868 --> 00:20:59,360
Why? You think playing an instrument
isn't a job? What is it then, a joke?

179
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:03,567
No, what are you saying?
No, I would never say that.

180
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:09,307
In fact, in my family I have
a cousin who plays the...

181
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,308
What?

182
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:15,046
The violin!

183
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,960
Strange paintings, huh?

184
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:26,920
Yes.

185
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:32,160
Let me ask you something.
Did you move anything...

186
00:21:32,237 --> 00:21:35,070
...change something around
or take anything from here?

187
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,471
Are you crazy?

188
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:41,171
We're very careful not to move a thing.
Why? Is there something wrong?

189
00:21:43,148 --> 00:21:47,346
No, no, I mean...
It's just an impression, maybe.

190
00:21:49,488 --> 00:21:51,388
Sorry, you were asking?

191
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,459
Ah yes, the victim!
Please.

192
00:21:56,161 --> 00:21:57,788
You knew her, didn't you?

193
00:21:58,998 --> 00:22:03,059
Yes, I already told you, I live upstairs.
Her name was Helga Ulman.

194
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:06,230
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

195
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,143
A raincoat...Tell me about the raincoat
the murderer was wearing.

196
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,341
Wait a minute. I didn't say the
murderer was wearing it.

197
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:24,111
All I said was that I noticed
a man with a dark raincoat...

198
00:22:24,223 --> 00:22:26,316
...walking away from the building.

199
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:32,189
Good evening! Hi everybody!

200
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:36,064
Get lost!
You can't come in here!

201
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:39,763
Why not? A crime like this, the first
thing you do is call the press!

202
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,239
Get your hands off me!
I told you, you can't come in here!

203
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:45,538
We're conducting a very
complex investigation here!

204
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:47,339
Look who's here!

205
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:49,410
Gianna Brezzi!

206
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:50,982
Yes, Inspector!

207
00:22:52,484 --> 00:22:57,148
- Who told you about the crime?
- I have my sources.

208
00:22:57,256 --> 00:23:00,350
As it happens, the victim
was rather famous even in Italy.

209
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:04,054
In fact, she gave an important
lecture this very afternoon.

210
00:23:04,997 --> 00:23:07,557
What did this famous lady do?

211
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:10,996
She was... a sort of magician.

212
00:23:13,405 --> 00:23:15,930
She could read people's minds.

213
00:23:16,175 --> 00:23:17,699
Well! I'll be...

214
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:19,775
I thought she was...

215
00:23:19,878 --> 00:23:21,368
You! Yes, I am sure!

216
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:26,080
You're the one who saw the whole thing.
The eye witness extraordinaire!

217
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:31,688
Fabbroni, get Mingozzi for me.
I have something to tell him.

218
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,258
- Then call the Station.
- Yes, Inspector.

219
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:38,122
Why must I go to the Police Station?

220
00:23:38,197 --> 00:23:41,132
I told you everything I know!
I don't understand what else...

221
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:45,966
It's for your statement. It has to be
officially typed, you know, bureaucracy!

222
00:23:46,972 --> 00:23:52,308
And also all your information:
place and date of birth, passport, etc.

223
00:24:00,452 --> 00:24:03,478
My head is splitting!

224
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:11,821
And you, what the hell are you
doing here at this hour?

225
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:15,628
I'm on my way home...
after four hours at the Police Station.

226
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:18,464
Oh yeah, right.

227
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:21,666
I forgot about the murder.

228
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:25,270
How did it go?

229
00:24:26,078 --> 00:24:29,912
What kind of question is that?
How do you suppose it went?

230
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:32,279
Come on, I'll walk you home.

231
00:24:32,351 --> 00:24:36,082
No, thank you. I can make it by myself.

232
00:24:38,257 --> 00:24:40,191
I can make it, I said!

233
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:51,569
Oh, my poor head, my head...

234
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:54,902
Tell me, how much did you drink?

235
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:00,777
Who knows? Who can remember
anything about this night?

236
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:03,245
But I'm sure it must have been a lot.

237
00:25:05,317 --> 00:25:08,013
Why not come to my place for coffee?

238
00:25:08,086 --> 00:25:13,285
No thanks, thanks anyway.
I'd rather sleep in my own bed.

239
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,627
Bye.

240
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:20,626
Carlo? Carlo?

241
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,736
Did you see that man
leaving the building?

242
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:27,027
A man?

243
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:30,336
Yeah, a man in a dark raincoat?
Right after the murder.

244
00:25:31,276 --> 00:25:33,267
I think he's the killer.

245
00:25:34,046 --> 00:25:35,570
Wait, wait...

246
00:25:36,148 --> 00:25:39,845
Yes, I saw him for a second
from the back.

247
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:44,819
Listen, Carlo. Something strange
happened to me, very strange...

248
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,154
...and I don't know if it's true or not but...

249
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:50,718
...when I went into that woman's
apartment, the first time...

250
00:25:50,996 --> 00:25:52,987
... I thought I saw a painting.

251
00:25:53,098 --> 00:25:56,158
But then a few minutes later it was gone.

252
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:58,235
What happened to me?

253
00:25:58,537 --> 00:26:02,200
To you, nothing. But maybe
the painting was made to disappear...

254
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:05,107
...because it represented
something important.

255
00:26:05,244 --> 00:26:09,544
- What did you say?
- It represented something important!

256
00:26:09,982 --> 00:26:11,711
No, no, I don't think so.

257
00:26:11,817 --> 00:26:16,049
If I remember well, it was... it was...
some sort of composition of faces...

258
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:17,816
...something very unusual.

259
00:26:19,825 --> 00:26:24,228
Look, maybe you've seen something
so important that you can't realize it.

260
00:26:26,198 --> 00:26:29,634
But I... I'm just trying to understand,
because...

261
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:36,364
You know, sometimes, what you
actually see and what you imagine...

262
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:41,610
...get mixed up in your memory
like a cocktail...

263
00:26:43,782 --> 00:26:47,548
...from which you can no longer
distinguish one flavor from another.

264
00:26:47,653 --> 00:26:49,518
But I'm telling you the truth!

265
00:26:49,588 --> 00:26:55,049
No, Marc. You think you're telling
the truth, but in fact...

266
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,891
...you're only telling
your version of the truth.

267
00:27:00,232 --> 00:27:02,393
It happens to me all the time.

268
00:27:14,446 --> 00:27:17,438
That one there with the raincoat.
That's Giordani.

269
00:27:17,783 --> 00:27:21,742
He's a professor in Psychiatry, and an
enthusiast of parapsychology.

270
00:27:21,853 --> 00:27:24,651
A great friend of Helga's,
he practically kept her.

271
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:28,055
The man with the glasses
is Mario Bardi.

272
00:27:30,696 --> 00:27:32,994
He's also a clairvoyant...

273
00:27:33,365 --> 00:27:36,027
...and was a great friend of poor Helga.

274
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,158
Let's go.

275
00:28:24,516 --> 00:28:27,610
By the way... I wanted to thank you!

276
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:28,777
"I've seen the murderer. "

277
00:28:28,854 --> 00:28:31,914
It's nice to be brought to
the attention of murderers!

278
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,252
Oh, come on!

279
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:38,927
Look, you may not believe me, but I
don't have a steady boyfriend right now.

280
00:28:39,031 --> 00:28:41,625
- Me neither.
- Ah, I should hope not!

281
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,800
I meant a girlfriend!

282
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:46,429
Ah, that's why you're always so jumpy!

283
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:49,336
Me jumpy? Oh please!
I am not jumpy at all!

284
00:28:49,408 --> 00:28:52,002
Yeah right! And stop fidgeting!
You're always scratching...

285
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:55,341
...your hands are shaking.
Tell me, what's going on?

286
00:28:55,414 --> 00:28:58,281
How many times must I tell you
that I'm an artist?

287
00:28:58,383 --> 00:29:03,082
In case you've forgotten, we artists are
very sensitive people, is that clear?

288
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:06,352
We don't have elephant hide
like you journalists!

289
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:11,657
Elephant hide? I'm told I have
very delicate skin.

290
00:29:11,763 --> 00:29:14,197
You can touch it, come on, try!

291
00:29:16,268 --> 00:29:18,702
- Yes, not bad.
- It's fantastic!

292
00:29:20,105 --> 00:29:22,835
I know a way to stop your jumpiness...

293
00:29:22,941 --> 00:29:25,432
What? Here at the cemetery?
Are you crazy?

294
00:29:26,578 --> 00:29:29,706
Anyway, I've other things
on my mind, understand?

295
00:29:29,781 --> 00:29:32,511
- Sure, you are scared witless!
- I am not scared!

296
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:35,280
Right, you're almost
pooping your pants!

297
00:29:35,454 --> 00:29:37,319
And it's all my fault!

298
00:29:37,422 --> 00:29:42,189
And I would like to see him, you know?
I'm curious to see him face to face.

299
00:29:42,561 --> 00:29:44,893
Forget it. You'd be better off
returning to England.

300
00:29:44,963 --> 00:29:47,022
To tell you the truth I decided to stay.

301
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:49,727
- You've just decided that?
- Yes, maybe.

302
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:53,828
Anyway, I need to concentrate.
I must try to remember.

303
00:29:53,939 --> 00:29:56,601
I am sure I saw something very
important that night...

304
00:29:56,675 --> 00:29:59,542
...but I can't remember what exactly,
damn it!

305
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:03,107
Are you driving?

306
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,416
No, Marc, wait!
I have to get in this side.

307
00:30:07,786 --> 00:30:10,152
The other door is jammed.
Oh, sorry!

308
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:23,695
Long live Italy!

309
00:30:29,674 --> 00:30:32,871
That seat broke the other day.
Is it very uncomfortable?

310
00:30:34,646 --> 00:30:37,740
Why don't you help with this
murder story?

311
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:40,613
If you could give me hand on this scoop...

312
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:44,018
...maybe I can get away from reporting
on the environment.

313
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:47,885
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

314
00:30:47,993 --> 00:30:51,292
- You've locked the door!
- Why, shouldn't I have?

315
00:30:51,596 --> 00:30:54,656
The lock jams, and now we'll need
a mechanic to open it!

316
00:30:54,766 --> 00:30:55,960
That's all we need!

317
00:30:56,401 --> 00:31:00,929
Damn! The car's not exactly new,
you know?

318
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:03,733
- Gianna, just drive fast, will you?
- Why?

319
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:07,107
I suffer a little from claustrophobia.

320
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,777
Alright.

321
00:31:40,312 --> 00:31:44,681
Tell me, Enrico, why do Australian
boomerang sellers go bankrupt?

322
00:31:44,749 --> 00:31:46,410
No, I don't know that one.

323
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:50,352
They go bankrupt because the
goods are always returned!

324
00:31:51,656 --> 00:31:53,351
Funny, don't you think?

325
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:58,958
- Carlo's not in yet?
- No, he never shows up before ten.

326
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,430
Could you please tell him I was
looking for him?

327
00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:03,558
- I need to speak to him urgently?
- Of course.

328
00:32:04,536 --> 00:32:09,235
Everything in the house.
Let's hide it all.

329
00:32:10,575 --> 00:32:15,638
No, no one will ever find out.

330
00:32:17,148 --> 00:32:18,615
We must forget.

331
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:22,218
We must forget everything.

332
00:32:22,954 --> 00:32:24,581
Forever...

333
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:29,956
Forever... That's all.

334
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:33,394
She was pointing over there.

335
00:32:33,531 --> 00:32:35,692
To the middle of the 6th or the 7th row.

336
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:40,237
And you can't remember anything?
Not even a face?

337
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:41,930
No, absolutely impossible.

338
00:32:42,073 --> 00:32:46,339
All the lights were on us
and the stalls were in darkness.

339
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:50,677
I must say, in thinking it over,
I seem to recall...

340
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:55,210
...while Helga was speaking,
I noticed some kind of movement...

341
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,222
...in the 6th or 7th...
or maybe the 8th row.

342
00:32:59,457 --> 00:33:02,392
- I can't say exactly.
- What kind of movement?

343
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:06,623
Sorry, what did you say?
Could you repeat that please?

344
00:33:06,731 --> 00:33:09,859
I said... what kind of movement?

345
00:33:10,035 --> 00:33:11,832
It's hard to say.

346
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,530
As if someone had stood up
and left the row...

347
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:18,871
...but of course it was just an impression,
more than anything else.

348
00:33:18,943 --> 00:33:21,070
With the lights on,
we couldn't see anything...

349
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:28,080
You see, you're not jumpy anymore.

350
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:32,181
You can even button your shirt
without shaking at all.

351
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:35,492
Look, will you cut it out
about being jumpy?

352
00:33:35,727 --> 00:33:40,721
It's a question of character, it's in my
nature. It's my artistic temperament.

353
00:33:42,233 --> 00:33:44,201
Why did you become a pianist?

354
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:50,100
Well, my psychiatrist would say
it's because I hated my father.

355
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:56,142
So in pressing the keys,
I was like smashing his teeth.

356
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,250
Actually it's because I love music.

357
00:34:01,953 --> 00:34:05,582
What about you?
Why are you a journalist?

358
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,282
Because I like working.

359
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:11,359
And I think a woman has to be
independent to be equal to a man...

360
00:34:11,463 --> 00:34:13,795
Oh, God, let's not start on sex equality!

361
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:16,190
It's all rubbish, not true at all.

362
00:34:16,534 --> 00:34:20,994
Men and women are different.
Women are delicate...

363
00:34:22,273 --> 00:34:23,240
...fragile.

364
00:34:23,441 --> 00:34:26,376
What? Delicate?

365
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,138
Fragile?

366
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:48,259
- Why are you clearing the table?
- Come over here.

367
00:34:49,334 --> 00:34:52,269
- What's that?
- Arm wrestling.

368
00:34:52,871 --> 00:34:53,860
Come on!

369
00:34:54,272 --> 00:34:55,967
Then we'll see who's delicate!

370
00:34:56,074 --> 00:34:58,508
Don't be ridiculous!
I've better things to do.

371
00:34:58,576 --> 00:34:59,565
Afraid?

372
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:11,285
That was total cheating,
you can't start before I'm ready!

373
00:35:11,356 --> 00:35:14,416
It doesn't count.
You must play by the rules.

374
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:16,115
And you too!

375
00:35:16,194 --> 00:35:19,493
We do it properly or not at all.
Still want to go ahead?

376
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:22,397
Will you play by the rules
without cheating? Properly?

377
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:23,456
Alright.

378
00:35:24,302 --> 00:35:26,327
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

379
00:35:32,177 --> 00:35:33,235
Let's go.

380
00:35:33,545 --> 00:35:36,708
Both elbows must stay on the table
and no sudden movements.

381
00:35:36,781 --> 00:35:39,272
- I know the rules!
- We'll start when I say, okay?

382
00:35:42,954 --> 00:35:43,943
Ready?

383
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:46,682
Steady... steady... wait...

384
00:35:51,229 --> 00:35:52,253
One...

385
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:54,923
Two...

386
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:57,459
Three...

387
00:35:58,369 --> 00:35:59,358
Go!

388
00:36:15,286 --> 00:36:18,915
That doesn't count either!
You lifted your elbow off the table!

389
00:36:19,023 --> 00:36:21,651
It's an old trick, a dirty old trick!

390
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:25,559
- You're a cheat! It's so ridiculous!
- You're right.

391
00:36:25,663 --> 00:36:27,631
And you go around challenging people!

392
00:36:27,732 --> 00:36:31,691
You're big... and macho...
I surrender!

393
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,697
So, where are we going now?

394
00:36:34,806 --> 00:36:36,171
Where are we going?

395
00:36:36,841 --> 00:36:38,900
I'm not going anywhere with you.

396
00:36:38,977 --> 00:36:42,174
If anyone is going anywhere,
I am going by myself.

397
00:36:42,247 --> 00:36:44,215
Oh sure, but where?

398
00:36:45,316 --> 00:36:47,784
I'm going to see a friend,
if you must know.

399
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:50,510
I have things to do.
I can't sit here all day...

400
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:52,749
...arm wrestling just to keep you amused!

401
00:36:52,857 --> 00:36:57,157
I'm on to something important,
but I'm not saying what, is that clear?

402
00:36:57,595 --> 00:37:02,157
Listen, don't be angry now.
Why can't I go with you?

403
00:37:03,568 --> 00:37:07,629
- But we started this job together, right?
- No.

404
00:37:08,506 --> 00:37:14,502
Statistics prove you can't work
seriously with liberated women.

405
00:37:15,313 --> 00:37:18,578
So, whether you like it or not,
I'm going on my own.

406
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:22,819
Listen, have it your own way, stupid!

407
00:37:23,021 --> 00:37:27,390
I'll carry out my own investigation,
and we'll see who comes out on top!

408
00:37:28,393 --> 00:37:30,953
What's that?
Another test of arm wrestling?

409
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:32,620
Yeah, in a way.

410
00:37:33,831 --> 00:37:34,957
So be it.

411
00:37:35,266 --> 00:37:38,235
Wait! You didn't tell me
when I'll see you again.

412
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:39,926
Never.

413
00:37:40,905 --> 00:37:42,099
Oh, really?

414
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,337
How about later tonight?

415
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,810
- When will you be back?
- I don't know.

416
00:38:07,498 --> 00:38:08,931
I'll try to call you.

417
00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:15,295
Okay. But I'll tell you again that I don't...

418
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,031
If you don't want to, just say so.

419
00:38:18,242 --> 00:38:22,576
I was just trying to say that I don't
know what time I'll be back.

420
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,047
Alright.

421
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:30,881
Bye.

422
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:37,050
Tell me the truth.

423
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:41,521
Do you find me so unattractive?

424
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,194
- No.
- So, what's wrong, then?

425
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:49,773
- My smell? What?
- Nothing at all, why?

426
00:38:50,642 --> 00:38:53,611
Oh nothing. I was just wondering!

427
00:38:55,146 --> 00:38:56,170
Yes?

428
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:59,844
Excuse me, I'm Marc Daly,
I'm a friend of Carlo's.

429
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:01,919
Oh do come in, Marc dear.

430
00:39:02,053 --> 00:39:05,216
I know you by name.
Carlo mentions you very often.

431
00:39:05,323 --> 00:39:07,314
You're an engineer, right?

432
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:10,588
No, I'm a pianist.
I teach at the Conservatory.

433
00:39:10,695 --> 00:39:13,721
A pianist? Please, come in.

434
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:17,795
What can I offer you?
Coffee or a drink?

435
00:39:17,902 --> 00:39:22,362
No, thank you, nothing.
I actually came to see Carlo.

436
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:25,336
He wasn't at the Blue Bar, so I thought...

437
00:39:25,443 --> 00:39:27,741
A drink, wasn't it?
Is this alright?

438
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:32,575
It's Coca Cola!
I'll just make some coffee and...

439
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:37,687
No, no, please. Don't go to any trouble.
I just came to see Carlo.

440
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:39,380
I'll call him, then.

441
00:39:43,127 --> 00:39:45,118
I'm so absent-minded.

442
00:39:45,229 --> 00:39:48,596
I'm sorry, Carlo is not here,
he's gone out.

443
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:51,731
Come here Marc, come and talk to me.

444
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,370
Come over here with me.

445
00:39:56,174 --> 00:40:00,008
Tell me something about yourself.
How long have you been an engineer?

446
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:04,773
- No. Madam, I am pianist.
- And I'm an actress.

447
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:08,750
Or rather I was an actress.
That's me in all those photos.

448
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:11,344
What do you think?
Was I good or what?

449
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:13,450
Yes, I'm sure.

450
00:40:13,558 --> 00:40:16,527
I just wish I'd had the opportunity to...

451
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:18,094
Never mind.

452
00:40:18,196 --> 00:40:22,792
When I married Carlo's father-
Carlo wasn't born then, of course...

453
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,301
...he made me give up my career.

454
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:29,433
Now, it's all gone.

455
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:33,438
It's not important now.
I console myself by playing the piano.

456
00:40:33,578 --> 00:40:38,015
- Do you play the piano?
- The piano...? I'm a pianist.

457
00:40:38,182 --> 00:40:41,982
Oh, what a magnificent combination!
A piano playing engineer!

458
00:40:42,086 --> 00:40:44,213
Could we play a duet?

459
00:40:44,388 --> 00:40:47,619
No, unfortunately I just don't have the time.

460
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:52,389
I really need to see Carlo urgently.
Do you know where he is?

461
00:40:52,697 --> 00:40:54,688
He went to see a friend.

462
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:58,667
Someone called Massimo Ricci...
28 Via Crescenzio.

463
00:41:04,575 --> 00:41:06,668
Sorry, my mistake.

464
00:41:21,592 --> 00:41:24,390
I'm... I'm looking for a friend, Carlo.

465
00:41:24,862 --> 00:41:27,422
His mother gave me this address.
Is he here?

466
00:41:27,665 --> 00:41:29,792
Yes, yes, do come in.

467
00:41:31,803 --> 00:41:32,827
Thank you.

468
00:41:42,046 --> 00:41:46,278
You don't know how ill he's been.
I wish I knew what's come over him.

469
00:41:47,084 --> 00:41:48,779
He's still very sick.

470
00:41:55,326 --> 00:41:57,658
He's been like this for over an hour.

471
00:41:58,062 --> 00:42:00,690
He started to drink as he usually does.

472
00:42:00,798 --> 00:42:03,232
Maybe more than usual.

473
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:05,665
Then he started talking nonsense.

474
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,598
Look who's here.

475
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:13,937
You caught me red handed, huh?

476
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:17,538
Good old Carlo...

477
00:42:18,683 --> 00:42:23,245
He's not only a drunk
but a faggot as well.

478
00:42:24,422 --> 00:42:25,787
Surprise!

479
00:42:25,857 --> 00:42:27,757
I don't give a damn about
your preferences!

480
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:32,152
But I already told you that you won't
last for long if you drink that much!

481
00:42:32,897 --> 00:42:36,993
And I told you... who wants to last?

482
00:42:38,302 --> 00:42:42,238
The liver is gone,
and so are the intestines.

483
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,167
Come on, try to get up.

484
00:42:44,242 --> 00:42:46,870
Put your head under a cold tap,
it'll do you good.

485
00:42:46,944 --> 00:42:49,310
Then I'll take you out
to get some fresh air.

486
00:42:58,089 --> 00:43:01,490
I love that guy. But he's such a downer.

487
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:03,389
He drank a lot today.

488
00:43:04,395 --> 00:43:08,923
Then he started talking a lot of nonsense.
I think he's really cracking up.

489
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:12,664
He said he wanted to go away.
And then he wanted to make love.

490
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:14,704
And then he wanted to sleep.

491
00:43:15,206 --> 00:43:17,106
He kept getting worse.

492
00:43:17,408 --> 00:43:20,844
And then he started to scream.
I was about to call a doctor.

493
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:29,009
Would you like some coffee?

494
00:43:29,387 --> 00:43:32,413
No, it's very late already.

495
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:36,289
I need to go, or I'll be thrown out
of the Blue Bar for good.

496
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:43,726
You're coming with me?

497
00:43:45,803 --> 00:43:46,792
Yes.

498
00:43:56,013 --> 00:43:57,037
Bye.

499
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,217
Sorry...

500
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,486
- ...for what happened before.
- Don't be silly. Call me.

501
00:44:16,634 --> 00:44:17,794
Good bye.

502
00:44:23,607 --> 00:44:25,370
Why did you come looking for me?

503
00:44:26,944 --> 00:44:28,605
I wanted to ask you something.

504
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:31,807
Remember the other night,
the night of the murder?

505
00:44:32,616 --> 00:44:36,484
Well, I said... I thought I saw
a painting in that house.

506
00:44:36,587 --> 00:44:39,283
But a few moments later
it was gone, remember?

507
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,618
Vaguely.

508
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:42,258
Do you have a light?

509
00:44:46,964 --> 00:44:51,333
You said that maybe the painting
represented something important.

510
00:44:52,203 --> 00:44:55,570
You said a lot of things
about memory and truth...

511
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,275
A lot of things I didn't really
understand at the time.

512
00:44:59,377 --> 00:45:00,401
Yeah.

513
00:45:01,479 --> 00:45:02,946
I remember something but...

514
00:45:03,047 --> 00:45:06,744
I can't remember what I wanted to say.
I was probably talking nonsense.

515
00:45:08,285 --> 00:45:11,652
I was dead drunk.

516
00:45:11,822 --> 00:45:14,985
Look... listen Marc...

517
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,052
...why don't you just pack up
and clear out?

518
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:26,497
What are you doing messing around
with this business anyway?

519
00:45:27,872 --> 00:45:31,433
Why are you annoying a madman?
A maniac?

520
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:36,839
Anyone who would commit such a
monstrous crime, is certainly a maniac.

521
00:45:40,184 --> 00:45:42,584
If you must know,
I'm attracted to madmen.

522
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,883
I can't help it. I have a morbid
fascination for them.

523
00:45:46,957 --> 00:45:49,187
But wait, wait... listen.

524
00:45:50,661 --> 00:45:54,757
That painting was definitely there,
I didn't imagine that.

525
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:58,965
And I feel it's something important.

526
00:45:59,937 --> 00:46:01,336
So now...

527
00:46:02,706 --> 00:46:06,733
...it's become kind of a challenge...
with my memory.

528
00:46:07,278 --> 00:46:09,269
- A challenge...
- Right, a challenge.

529
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:12,247
I challenge myself too, all the time.

530
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:17,043
And I always lose...
But this is different for you.

531
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:22,485
If you lose, apart from the challenge...

532
00:46:23,527 --> 00:46:25,688
...you'll end up getting murdered yourself!

533
00:46:31,635 --> 00:46:35,731
No further news on the murder of
German mind-reader, Helga Ulman.

534
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,934
Police are concentrating
their investigation...

535
00:46:39,043 --> 00:46:44,504
...on a person seen leaving the
scene of the crime that very night.

536
00:46:45,049 --> 00:46:49,349
According to an unofficial
newspaper report...

537
00:46:49,453 --> 00:46:53,082
...the eye witness can identify
the mysterious night visitor.

538
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:23,115
Carlo should be very careful.

539
00:47:23,187 --> 00:47:26,714
If they find out he's a good pianist,
they'll get rid of him for sure!

540
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:15,276
Whoever you are, please help me!

541
00:52:15,379 --> 00:52:18,280
Marc? It's me, Gianna!
What are you talking about?

542
00:52:19,216 --> 00:52:22,014
You won't get away...

543
00:52:22,686 --> 00:52:28,591
I'll kill you sooner or later...

544
00:52:30,627 --> 00:52:31,753
Hello?

545
00:52:31,862 --> 00:52:35,764
- What is it? Hello? Hello?
- Listen, Gianna, Gianna!

546
00:52:36,066 --> 00:52:40,696
There's somebody in the house.
He talked to me, he wants to kill me!

547
00:52:41,605 --> 00:52:43,937
- Want me to call the police?
- Wait, wait a second.

548
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:45,197
Hello?

549
00:52:56,119 --> 00:52:57,552
Little songs for children

550
00:53:14,204 --> 00:53:19,437
Well, that's it, alright. That's the
same song I heard last night.

551
00:53:19,977 --> 00:53:22,241
And if I remember correctly...

552
00:53:22,346 --> 00:53:26,806
...you said that Helga talked about
a nursery rhyme in the theater.

553
00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:28,240
That's right!

554
00:53:28,452 --> 00:53:32,786
And this song may very well be
the reoccurring theme of the crimes.

555
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:37,383
You see, we are starting to form what
I presume to be the correct profile.

556
00:53:37,995 --> 00:53:40,555
The murderer is a schizophrenic paranoid.

557
00:53:41,131 --> 00:53:43,622
Anyone who kills with such a frenzy...

558
00:53:44,434 --> 00:53:47,198
...surely does it in a state of
temporary insanity!

559
00:53:47,804 --> 00:53:52,070
And well, in every day life this person
could appear quite normal.

560
00:53:52,476 --> 00:53:54,068
Like you or me.

561
00:53:54,378 --> 00:53:59,008
And when he kills he must recreate
these specific conditions...

562
00:53:59,216 --> 00:54:02,185
...which will trigger the release
of all his madness.

563
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:05,517
A particular time of day, a particular
day of the week, even clothing...

564
00:54:05,622 --> 00:54:10,184
Something that recreates the
same images that, in the past...

565
00:54:11,061 --> 00:54:14,428
...were the occasional frame
of his provoking trauma.

566
00:54:16,733 --> 00:54:20,999
I'd like to add something much less
scientific to this business...

567
00:54:21,104 --> 00:54:23,595
...about the children's song.

568
00:54:23,707 --> 00:54:28,838
If you recall, as well as a child singing,
Helga also mentioned a house.

569
00:54:29,346 --> 00:54:30,404
And well...

570
00:54:30,681 --> 00:54:36,449
I remember having read a book,
quite some time ago, a strange book.

571
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:42,117
I think the title was "Ghosts of Today
and Legends of the Modern Age".

572
00:54:42,793 --> 00:54:48,425
The author spoke about a haunted
house, from which the neighbors...

573
00:54:48,498 --> 00:54:52,264
...could sometimes hear singing
like this little song.

574
00:54:53,203 --> 00:54:57,970
The book suggested an act of bloodshed
was once committed in that house.

575
00:54:58,075 --> 00:55:00,134
Do you have that book?

576
00:55:00,277 --> 00:55:06,113
Oh no, but you could easily find it in the
library of folklore and popular traditions.

577
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:08,877
"Ghosts of Today and
Legends of the Modern Age"

578
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:21,991
The House of the Screaming Child

579
00:55:22,065 --> 00:55:24,590
In a house near Rome,
a strange thing happened.

580
00:55:24,668 --> 00:55:26,795
One night, a hunter woke up
before dawn...

581
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:30,101
...and heard a child singing in a
high shrill voice,. soon after...

582
00:55:30,173 --> 00:55:33,506
... the voice stopped, and he heard
shrieking screams and weeping.

583
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,465
No, nothing.

584
00:56:31,768 --> 00:56:36,569
No news other than what Bardi gave me.
No names, no addresses.

585
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,536
So, what are you going to do, now?

586
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:42,237
I'd like to contact the author.

587
00:56:42,312 --> 00:56:46,976
Would you write down her name?
Her name is Amanda Righetti.

588
00:56:47,084 --> 00:56:48,312
Got it.

589
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,061
What the hell! What are you doing?

590
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:02,425
Why did you put the phone right here?!

591
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:05,267
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, listen..

592
00:57:05,469 --> 00:57:08,927
Will you try to find out her address
for me? It's important.

593
00:57:09,473 --> 00:57:11,634
She should know where this house is.

594
00:57:12,042 --> 00:57:15,637
She probably knows other things
that can be useful to us.

595
00:57:15,746 --> 00:57:20,445
Listen, I'll call you back.
I can't hear a thing in this bar.

596
00:57:20,884 --> 00:57:22,215
What did you say?

597
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:25,586
The address! Oh, this is impossible!

598
00:57:25,856 --> 00:57:28,723
Can't you wait until I'm done?
It's a sauna in here!

599
00:58:04,494 --> 00:58:08,362
- When you come, remember the birds.
- Oh, don't worry, Ms. Amanda.

600
00:58:08,465 --> 00:58:14,426
I don't understand why you keep these
strange Indian blackbirds.

601
00:58:14,538 --> 00:58:18,998
I feel less lonely. They whistle, they
imitate things, the television, our voices..

602
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:22,408
Oh, it's like having a madman
around the house!

603
00:58:23,513 --> 00:58:25,071
I'd be scared.

604
00:58:25,882 --> 00:58:28,180
- See you tomorrow.
- See you, Elvira.

605
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:08,484
Elvira!

606
01:01:03,807 --> 01:01:04,796
The child.

607
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:07,834
The house.

608
01:01:09,245 --> 01:01:11,145
The ghost of the house.

609
01:06:58,528 --> 01:07:02,487
You have two choices: you can
either flee to Lebanon and quickly...

610
01:07:02,565 --> 01:07:05,329
...or I can jump right into it and
try to find out what's going on...

611
01:07:05,401 --> 01:07:07,096
...and in the shortest possible time.

612
01:07:07,303 --> 01:07:10,466
How much time will
the police take to find me?

613
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:12,735
Did you take a taxi to Amanda's?

614
01:07:12,809 --> 01:07:15,869
No, a rental car.
Why haven't you fixed this seat?

615
01:07:15,945 --> 01:07:19,779
- I feel stupid sitting so low!
- I forgot, sorry!

616
01:07:19,849 --> 01:07:22,716
You'll see, they'll find you
through your fingerprints.

617
01:07:22,785 --> 01:07:25,345
I bet you left them
all over the house, right?

618
01:07:25,555 --> 01:07:29,992
Right. It would take another
Florence flood to wipe them all!

619
01:07:32,161 --> 01:07:34,561
Let's say they find the body
tomorrow morning...

620
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:37,121
...they'll check the fingerprints with
the usual suspects.

621
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,169
It'll take them some time to connect
the two murders, but in the end...

622
01:07:40,236 --> 01:07:42,227
...they'll be after you.

623
01:07:42,338 --> 01:07:46,866
So, you only have a couple of days,
it's not much.

624
01:07:48,277 --> 01:07:49,266
No, it's not.

625
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:52,707
But first of all, I must find this.

626
01:07:56,386 --> 01:07:58,616
What a nice house, strange looking.

627
01:07:59,589 --> 01:08:01,022
Do you know where it is?

628
01:08:01,124 --> 01:08:03,820
I wouldn't have to find it if I knew!

629
01:08:04,927 --> 01:08:07,725
- So, what will you do?
- I'm not going to tell you.

630
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:12,495
You see, it seems as though
everything here has ears.

631
01:08:12,568 --> 01:08:15,401
How could the killer know
that I was going there?

632
01:08:15,505 --> 01:08:17,496
I have no idea.

633
01:08:19,742 --> 01:08:23,678
One thing is certain. I swear I won't
tell my next move to anyone.

634
01:08:23,746 --> 01:08:27,375
This is so unbelievable!
You are so nice!

635
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:30,613
Hey, darling, I hope you
don't think that I'm...

636
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:35,521
No, listen, I do this to protect you,
to keep you out of danger.

637
01:08:35,591 --> 01:08:38,321
- I promise, as soon as I...
- Bla-bla-bla!

638
01:08:38,394 --> 01:08:42,421
I swear, as soon as I discover
something, I'll tell you.

639
01:08:42,765 --> 01:08:46,132
Why don't we stop this stupid
childish competition?

640
01:08:46,669 --> 01:08:48,660
We should be working together.

641
01:08:48,738 --> 01:08:51,764
You know, two brains
are better than one.

642
01:08:53,142 --> 01:08:55,770
Just where do you women
keep your brain?

643
01:08:56,045 --> 01:08:58,912
Let's stop dreaming: women have the
brute force, the muscles...

644
01:08:58,981 --> 01:09:00,312
...you beat us at arm wrestling...

645
01:09:00,383 --> 01:09:02,908
...but I assure you, men have
the monopoly on intelligence.

646
01:09:02,985 --> 01:09:05,977
- Have I made myself clear?
- Yes, very clear.

647
01:09:06,622 --> 01:09:07,748
At last.

648
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:10,186
A little drink?

649
01:09:12,562 --> 01:09:13,756
I have...

650
01:09:14,764 --> 01:09:18,894
...Anisette, Sambuca,
Caffe Borghetti...

651
01:09:19,001 --> 01:09:21,970
Don't you have anything less sickly?

652
01:09:24,807 --> 01:09:26,468
Whisky, Cognac?

653
01:09:26,976 --> 01:09:29,570
Yes, that's better.

654
01:09:33,616 --> 01:09:36,517
We would be more comfortable
at my place, don't you think?

655
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,650
Maybe, but we're fine here.

656
01:09:41,123 --> 01:09:44,058
Yes, but I think we would
be better at my place.

657
01:09:46,295 --> 01:09:48,263
Okay, let's go.

658
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:04,238
Hey, what do you think you are, idiot!

659
01:10:04,413 --> 01:10:07,610
I never met a more arrogant man
than you!

660
01:10:07,717 --> 01:10:10,311
Women must have spoiled you rotten!

661
01:10:10,453 --> 01:10:13,889
Anyway, it's because I don't have
a boyfriend right now!

662
01:10:14,023 --> 01:10:16,548
That's all!
You've got such a big head.

663
01:10:17,026 --> 01:10:18,323
Oh damn...

664
01:10:18,694 --> 01:10:20,127
What's wrong?

665
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:22,729
Guess.

666
01:10:36,312 --> 01:10:39,509
Yes, yes, it's a Dracena Indivisa,
that's what it is.

667
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:42,846
An exotic tree that grows in the
Canaries.

668
01:10:42,952 --> 01:10:46,115
It's highly delicate and
it suffers if exposed to cold.

669
01:10:46,222 --> 01:10:50,591
We've never imported it.
It's very rare in or around the city.

670
01:10:50,826 --> 01:10:54,159
- No sir, never handled it myself.
- Thanks.

671
01:10:54,497 --> 01:10:55,896
No, never.

672
01:10:55,998 --> 01:10:56,828
Yes.

673
01:10:56,899 --> 01:10:59,197
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

674
01:10:59,335 --> 01:11:00,927
But it was a long time ago.

675
01:11:01,037 --> 01:11:05,269
I remember because I had just opened.
I ordered some from the Canaries.

676
01:11:05,408 --> 01:11:08,206
Unfortunately, most them died.

677
01:11:08,344 --> 01:11:13,213
The climate isn't right. I had a lot of
complaints, I never ordered them again.

678
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:18,078
- Who did you sell them to?
- I'll look up the old invoices.

679
01:11:18,154 --> 01:11:20,782
- Why do you care?
- Well... I'm an architect.

680
01:11:20,890 --> 01:11:24,826
- It's for environmental studies.
- Well, let's see what we can find.

681
01:11:25,428 --> 01:11:29,592
Where's my bottle? Spit out my bottle,
for Christ's sake! Damn you...

682
01:11:29,665 --> 01:11:32,930
Inspector! Finally!
I was looking for you for an hour!

683
01:11:33,002 --> 01:11:35,630
What do you want? Doesn't anybody
check these bloody machines?

684
01:11:35,705 --> 01:11:37,468
They do, sir, but they steal the drinks!

685
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:40,805
But of course, how strange!
Anyway this place is full of thieves!

686
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:44,311
- Sorry, Sir, but you're not thinking...
- Not you, idiot.

687
01:11:45,982 --> 01:11:49,281
So, are you doing overtime?

688
01:11:49,352 --> 01:11:51,980
Yes, for the moment
the strike's called off.

689
01:11:53,389 --> 01:11:55,857
Our requests are
examined by the Ministry.

690
01:11:55,925 --> 01:12:00,157
- But we're planning a sit-in.
- What are you planning?

691
01:12:00,229 --> 01:12:03,926
A protest sit-in. We all gather
outside in the courtyard...

692
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,298
...and we stay there for one,
two, four hours...

693
01:12:06,369 --> 01:12:08,496
Yes, but what did you
want to tell me before?

694
01:12:08,604 --> 01:12:13,234
I almost forgot. The chief is here
and he insists on speaking to you.

695
01:12:13,342 --> 01:12:14,934
Oh crap!

696
01:12:16,278 --> 01:12:20,612
Hello? Hello? Is this Professor Giordani?

697
01:12:21,617 --> 01:12:25,644
My name is Marc Daly.
I need talk to you, it's very important.

698
01:12:27,056 --> 01:12:30,457
No, I would like to see you right now,
if it's possible.

699
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:33,728
You see, Amanda Righetti
was murdered.

700
01:12:39,402 --> 01:12:43,668
She had her arm out to the side and
was pointing at the wall with her finger.

701
01:12:43,773 --> 01:12:45,365
It didn't look natural to me.

702
01:12:45,474 --> 01:12:48,739
It was as if she was trying to point
something out, you know?

703
01:12:54,116 --> 01:12:57,677
You think they've discovered
the body by now?

704
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:58,980
Yes, I think so.

705
01:12:59,088 --> 01:13:02,683
Maybe the pointing finger is
a figment of your imagination.

706
01:13:02,825 --> 01:13:06,124
I'll go over there and take a look.
You never know...

707
01:14:27,276 --> 01:14:30,939
For Sale - For Lease
For information, call Rodi

708
01:14:37,386 --> 01:14:41,152
No, I'm just the caretaker.
The house belonged to Carl Schwartz.

709
01:14:41,957 --> 01:14:43,356
Where is he now?

710
01:14:43,492 --> 01:14:46,893
He died. He was German...
a writer, odd sort of fella.

711
01:14:46,996 --> 01:14:52,127
Bought the place in '68, I think.
Before that, it was empty for a long time.

712
01:14:52,234 --> 01:14:54,794
People used to say it was
haunted by ghosts.

713
01:14:54,904 --> 01:14:59,705
Schwartz never heard the rumors. He just
thought the price was right and bought it.

714
01:14:59,809 --> 01:15:02,471
Knowing him, he'd have
bought it with the ghosts.

715
01:15:02,611 --> 01:15:07,105
- And who lived there before?
- I don't know. I only came here in '67.

716
01:15:07,716 --> 01:15:12,085
This writer, Schwartz...
Do you know how he died?

717
01:15:12,288 --> 01:15:15,451
An accident, poor fellow.
He fell out of a window.

718
01:15:15,691 --> 01:15:18,091
I'm the one who found her, you know?

719
01:15:18,194 --> 01:15:20,754
This morning, very early,
around eight o'clock.

720
01:15:20,863 --> 01:15:23,855
I come every morning to clean the house.

721
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:27,227
I could have died of shock!

722
01:15:27,336 --> 01:15:30,305
And the police, they kept me for hours!

723
01:15:30,406 --> 01:15:33,000
Asking all sorts of questions,
wanting to know everything.

724
01:15:33,108 --> 01:15:35,542
But what could I tell them?
What do I know?

725
01:15:35,644 --> 01:15:38,738
Just think, it hasn't been half an hour
since they took out the body!

726
01:15:38,814 --> 01:15:41,783
Poor Amanda.
Who could have done that?

727
01:15:41,884 --> 01:15:46,150
A maniac, who else? It's always a
maniac and they never catch them!

728
01:15:47,189 --> 01:15:48,850
Where was the body?

729
01:15:49,458 --> 01:15:50,982
In the bathroom.

730
01:15:51,994 --> 01:15:54,360
Come on, I'll show you.

731
01:15:59,468 --> 01:16:01,595
Look at all this blood.

732
01:16:02,571 --> 01:16:03,833
It's everywhere.

733
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:06,134
I'm going to clean up a bit.

734
01:16:06,242 --> 01:16:09,268
I leave before it gets dark.
I won't stay here alone!

735
01:16:09,778 --> 01:16:13,009
Excuse me, I want to at least
clean these marks off.

736
01:16:29,632 --> 01:16:30,690
Excuse me.

737
01:16:34,403 --> 01:16:35,461
Hello?

738
01:16:36,372 --> 01:16:38,431
Oh it's you, Francesca.

739
01:16:39,642 --> 01:16:42,873
Oh, if you only knew
what I've been through.

740
01:16:43,379 --> 01:16:46,007
No, no, no. They're gone.

741
01:16:46,348 --> 01:16:49,112
Yes, they took her away.

742
01:16:49,518 --> 01:16:52,282
Yes, they questioned me,
it was never-ending!

743
01:16:54,123 --> 01:16:58,389
A big man with a moustache said
I was an important witness...

744
01:16:58,527 --> 01:16:59,858
...that I could help him.

745
01:17:00,195 --> 01:17:01,856
I know quite a bit.

746
01:17:04,533 --> 01:17:06,694
Of course I told him everything!

747
01:17:09,638 --> 01:17:12,129
Oh, don't worry, I'll take the 6:30 bus...

748
01:17:51,947 --> 01:17:54,040
IT WAS

749
01:17:57,386 --> 01:17:59,513
What are you doing?

750
01:17:59,888 --> 01:18:01,856
Why are you running the hot water?

751
01:18:01,991 --> 01:18:05,586
I just wanted to find out...
who murdered Amanda.

752
01:18:05,694 --> 01:18:07,855
With hot water?

753
01:18:08,597 --> 01:18:10,155
Yes, with hot water.

754
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,601
You didn't hear if the police
found anything?

755
01:18:14,703 --> 01:18:16,000
Just a little doll...

756
01:18:16,705 --> 01:18:21,005
- Anything else?
- I heard them mentioning a child.

757
01:18:23,112 --> 01:18:24,238
Of course.

758
01:18:26,749 --> 01:18:27,875
A child.

759
01:18:33,455 --> 01:18:34,444
That's right.

760
01:18:36,425 --> 01:18:37,722
A child.

761
01:18:51,874 --> 01:18:55,173
My daughter will go with you.
I don't got time right now.

762
01:18:55,277 --> 01:18:58,508
- No hurry to bring the keys back.
- Okay. Thank you.

763
01:19:03,318 --> 01:19:04,979
Olga, Olga!

764
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,280
Come back this minute!

765
01:19:07,189 --> 01:19:08,281
Come on!

766
01:19:20,202 --> 01:19:22,898
- What is it?
- You little witch.

767
01:19:23,238 --> 01:19:25,638
I told you not to do that again!

768
01:19:26,308 --> 01:19:27,536
Now off you go, go!

769
01:19:36,618 --> 01:19:39,052
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

770
01:19:39,154 --> 01:19:41,622
Don't worry, my father's just a little crazy.

771
01:20:17,259 --> 01:20:18,248
Bye.

772
01:20:22,931 --> 01:20:25,957
Go home. I'll bring the keys back later.

773
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:31,339
- Be careful!
- Why?

774
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,432
- There are ghosts in there!
- What ghosts?

775
01:20:35,043 --> 01:20:37,671
I don't know, but everyone
around here says so!

776
01:20:43,919 --> 01:20:44,908
Bye.

777
01:30:00,141 --> 01:30:01,233
Mr. Daly!

778
01:30:01,976 --> 01:30:04,171
- Mr. Daly!
- Yes?

779
01:30:04,379 --> 01:30:07,576
Thank goodness!
We didn't see you come back.

780
01:30:07,716 --> 01:30:10,879
- Anything wrong?
- No, I was about to leave.

781
01:30:11,286 --> 01:30:14,778
The lights got turned off
a couple of years ago and...

782
01:30:14,923 --> 01:30:17,448
...no one lived there, so...

783
01:30:30,338 --> 01:30:32,932
What took so long?
What happened to your forehead?

784
01:30:33,041 --> 01:30:36,340
It's nothing, just a scratch.
A piece of glass fell on my head.

785
01:30:36,444 --> 01:30:38,571
I warned you to be careful...

786
01:31:11,813 --> 01:31:14,338
Road Assistance
for Heavy Transportation

787
01:35:48,990 --> 01:35:49,922
Hello, Gianna?

788
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:52,626
Hi Marc. What are you doing?
Having fun?

789
01:35:52,927 --> 01:35:55,919
Sure, I'm having a ball.
I finished two crossword puzzles.

790
01:35:56,164 --> 01:35:58,724
On the contrary, here,
I have a tough puzzle to solve.

791
01:35:58,933 --> 01:36:01,060
They killed Giordani not long ago.

792
01:36:01,202 --> 01:36:04,501
The neighbors called the police
because they heard screaming.

793
01:36:08,009 --> 01:36:13,743
- What did you do there?
- Nothing, just a scratch.

794
01:36:15,316 --> 01:36:20,481
Seriously, I must admit, right now
I don't know what's going on.

795
01:36:22,023 --> 01:36:26,119
This son-of-a-bitch knows everything!
He knows every move in advance.

796
01:36:27,295 --> 01:36:30,389
Sorry, but I don't remember where
you said I should flee to?

797
01:36:30,565 --> 01:36:33,295
- In Lebanon.
- Yeah, right.

798
01:36:33,434 --> 01:36:34,662
In Lebanon.

799
01:36:35,736 --> 01:36:39,263
But to go over there, I'd have to fly,
and I am afraid of flying.

800
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:42,832
Oh come on, there's no reason
to be nervous. Once you're in the air...

801
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:45,811
...just think that you'll land soon,
one way or another.

802
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:46,904
Thank you.

803
01:36:48,449 --> 01:36:50,781
How about we take the car
and drive to Spain?

804
01:36:51,486 --> 01:36:55,354
We? You mean that I can come too?

805
01:36:55,823 --> 01:36:57,085
Yes, if you'd like.

806
01:36:58,059 --> 01:36:59,890
Of course I would like it!

807
01:37:00,061 --> 01:37:03,792
Listen, we will have a great vacation!

808
01:37:03,865 --> 01:37:07,528
Sea, sun, bull-fights, parties,
flamenco... how's that sound?

809
01:37:07,702 --> 01:37:10,068
Sure, of course.
I suggested it, after all.

810
01:37:10,438 --> 01:37:13,805
I don't know about you, but I'm
about to have a nervous breakdown.

811
01:37:13,875 --> 01:37:16,776
Wait, wait. It's useless to
stay here and talk about it.

812
01:37:16,878 --> 01:37:20,837
Come on. Let's not waste any time.
Now, you go back home to pack.

813
01:37:23,284 --> 01:37:25,013
I'll be back in an hour!

814
01:37:25,987 --> 01:37:30,788
We'll have to rent a car, because
mine isn't good for long trips.

815
01:37:31,359 --> 01:37:32,724
I know.

816
01:37:33,394 --> 01:37:34,759
I love you!

817
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:40,594
And who's this?

818
01:37:42,737 --> 01:37:47,674
An old girlfriend...
Her name is Carol.

819
01:37:47,808 --> 01:37:49,207
- From Rome?
- No...

820
01:37:49,343 --> 01:37:51,937
She's American,
but now she lives in Paris.

821
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:57,278
You used to go for vamps, huh?
You like super sexy women...

822
01:38:51,405 --> 01:38:55,637
Hello? Good evening.
This is Marc Daly.

823
01:38:55,876 --> 01:38:57,468
Oh, the engineer.

824
01:38:57,645 --> 01:39:00,409
No, the pianist, remember?

825
01:39:01,015 --> 01:39:03,381
Could I speak to Carlo, is he home?

826
01:39:03,584 --> 01:39:05,176
No, he's just gone out.

827
01:39:05,486 --> 01:39:07,818
Would you like to come here
and wait for him?

828
01:39:07,922 --> 01:39:10,652
We could chat. Time flies
when you have company.

829
01:39:10,758 --> 01:39:14,421
Besides, maybe you didn't know,
but I was an actress...

830
01:39:14,528 --> 01:39:17,361
- What an idiot!
- I could recite something for you...

831
01:39:17,665 --> 01:39:21,761
- What did you say?
- Nothing. Sorry. Good evening.

832
01:39:29,176 --> 01:39:31,804
Why didn't I notice that before?

833
01:39:33,581 --> 01:39:36,379
Gianna -
I'm at 24 Via Susa, Marc

834
01:40:03,711 --> 01:40:05,110
I was right!

835
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:08,377
There's no window.

836
01:41:35,436 --> 01:41:36,630
Great!

837
01:45:45,819 --> 01:45:49,687
Forget it. It's too late.

838
01:45:50,391 --> 01:45:51,983
What happened?

839
01:45:52,626 --> 01:45:55,288
I found your note and I hurried here.

840
01:45:56,230 --> 01:45:59,893
I saw a reddish light in
one of the windows.

841
01:46:00,501 --> 01:46:04,494
So, I looked for you and you were
passed out, lying in the flames.

842
01:46:05,939 --> 01:46:07,907
You're lucky to be alive, you know?

843
01:46:08,008 --> 01:46:11,500
A few more minutes and you'd
have been roast chicken!

844
01:46:11,945 --> 01:46:14,436
Damn it! It's all lost.

845
01:46:14,982 --> 01:46:16,313
The body...

846
01:46:17,217 --> 01:46:20,516
...the walled-up room...
and that picture on the wall.

847
01:46:36,003 --> 01:46:39,871
Yes, 24 Via Susa. My name is
Gianna Brezzi, I'm a reporter.

848
01:46:40,607 --> 01:46:43,098
Yes of course, it's urgent.
Try to hurry up.

849
01:46:47,047 --> 01:46:51,882
Yes, hello Fire Department?
I want to report a fire at 24 Via Susa.

850
01:46:52,019 --> 01:46:54,988
This number? Excuse me,
what's the phone number here?

851
01:46:55,789 --> 01:46:58,280
831-4726.

852
01:46:59,159 --> 01:47:02,322
Hurry up, the fire has been
burning for some time...

853
01:47:02,629 --> 01:47:05,427
I want to know how it got started
in the first place.

854
01:47:07,401 --> 01:47:09,096
Well, if there are ghosts...

855
01:47:17,578 --> 01:47:19,910
- Who gave you this?
- This... I did it.

856
01:47:20,013 --> 01:47:23,346
No, that's impossible!
You couldn't have seen it!

857
01:47:23,450 --> 01:47:25,441
Who gave it to you? Don't lie to me!

858
01:47:25,552 --> 01:47:26,746
Leave her alone.

859
01:47:26,887 --> 01:47:29,981
She made it up.
She's a strange child.

860
01:47:30,424 --> 01:47:34,292
If you could just see what she does
to animals! She likes the macabre...

861
01:47:34,394 --> 01:47:38,330
That may be true, but she couldn't
possibly have imagined this!

862
01:47:38,599 --> 01:47:42,695
- It's identical to the one in the house!
- I... I saw it at school.

863
01:47:43,403 --> 01:47:46,634
Good girl, now tell me where
you got this, just tell me.

864
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:50,176
One day, as punishment, they made
me clean up the archives.

865
01:47:50,277 --> 01:47:55,237
There were lots of drawings, and in a
'50s file, there was one just like that.

866
01:47:57,351 --> 01:48:02,812
- Where do you go to school?
- The Leonardo da Vinci School.

867
01:48:12,299 --> 01:48:14,699
Leonardo da Vinci
Junior High School

868
01:49:32,746 --> 01:49:34,077
Principal's Office

869
01:49:34,681 --> 01:49:36,148
Administration

870
01:49:42,055 --> 01:49:43,613
Archives

871
01:50:08,248 --> 01:50:10,113
There must be a million of them!

872
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:13,385
They're all divided by subject
and academic year.

873
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:21,955
Drawing Class

874
01:50:23,597 --> 01:50:24,723
Look.

875
01:50:42,382 --> 01:50:43,906
Academic year
1951-1952

876
01:50:43,984 --> 01:50:45,212
Academic year
1950-1951

877
01:51:13,113 --> 01:51:15,843
- What is it?
- Didn't you hear that?

878
01:51:17,551 --> 01:51:18,813
No, what was it?

879
01:51:19,386 --> 01:51:23,152
I don't know... I can't describe it.

880
01:51:27,794 --> 01:51:31,355
You keep at it. I'm going to take a look.

881
01:51:52,686 --> 01:51:55,553
What do you say I call the police
and tell them we're here?

882
01:51:56,857 --> 01:51:58,290
Yeah, you're right.

883
01:52:11,471 --> 01:52:12,335
Gianna...

884
01:52:38,031 --> 01:52:39,020
Gianna!

885
01:54:10,657 --> 01:54:13,057
Marc, help me.

886
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:23,468
Gianna, darling!

887
01:54:27,474 --> 01:54:30,238
Stay calm, sweetie, calm...

888
01:54:32,712 --> 01:54:36,739
All this for some shitty article!

889
01:54:40,954 --> 01:54:42,512
You know who it is?

890
01:54:42,856 --> 01:54:44,380
Yes, I know.

891
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:48,221
I found the picture.

892
01:54:49,863 --> 01:54:52,832
Did you get that? It's not far,
you'll see it right away.

893
01:54:52,933 --> 01:54:55,265
The name is over the door.
Leonardo da Vinci.

894
01:55:17,924 --> 01:55:19,357
Don't hide.

895
01:55:23,763 --> 01:55:24,923
It's no use hiding.

896
01:55:33,039 --> 01:55:35,030
I know who you are, now.

897
01:55:41,615 --> 01:55:43,173
I read your name.

898
01:55:45,218 --> 01:55:46,344
Carlo.

899
01:55:48,455 --> 01:55:51,652
I got here too late. What a shame.

900
01:55:56,029 --> 01:55:59,487
Well, so now what are you going to do?

901
01:56:01,368 --> 01:56:02,460
Kill you.

902
01:56:03,436 --> 01:56:07,429
And I'm sorry because I like you.

903
01:56:11,144 --> 01:56:13,044
But I have to kill you.

904
01:56:17,784 --> 01:56:20,116
I told you to stay out of it.

905
01:56:21,388 --> 01:56:23,686
Pack up and clear out, I said!

906
01:56:27,227 --> 01:56:31,721
Why? Why didn't you listen to me?!

907
01:56:35,135 --> 01:56:37,865
Because you're stupid and stubborn.

908
01:56:41,107 --> 01:56:43,632
Don't you realize it's all your fault?

909
01:56:48,048 --> 01:56:50,414
You wouldn't let go of it.

910
01:56:50,984 --> 01:56:55,478
If you hadn't become involved, if you
hadn't stuck your damn nose in it all!

911
01:57:11,037 --> 01:57:13,028
You'll pay for this.

912
01:57:17,043 --> 01:57:18,874
And he could have killed you!

913
01:57:18,978 --> 01:57:21,310
Hey, he's over there!
Heading for the wall!

914
01:57:21,414 --> 01:57:22,642
Stop or I'll shoot!

915
01:58:36,589 --> 01:58:38,318
Don't worry, she's much better.

916
01:58:38,425 --> 01:58:41,326
- When will she wake up?
- Not until tomorrow morning.

917
01:58:41,394 --> 01:58:44,124
The operation was difficult,
but successful.

918
01:58:44,230 --> 01:58:46,061
She's a strong girl, don't worry.

919
01:59:46,092 --> 01:59:47,753
No, that's impossible.

920
01:59:49,429 --> 01:59:52,023
He was with me when Helga was killed.

921
01:59:53,967 --> 01:59:57,198
He saw the killer too.
It couldn't have been him!

922
01:59:58,004 --> 01:59:59,835
It has nothing to do with him.

923
02:00:00,273 --> 02:00:01,763
So why?

924
02:00:10,216 --> 02:00:11,808
Police Investigation

925
02:00:27,433 --> 02:00:29,663
Maybe that painting was
made to disappear...

926
02:00:29,769 --> 02:00:32,101
...because it represented
something important.

927
02:00:32,438 --> 02:00:35,669
Something so important
you don't even realize it.

928
02:00:36,042 --> 02:00:39,034
Important... Important...

929
02:00:39,679 --> 02:00:41,010
That painting...

930
02:01:15,381 --> 02:01:16,939
A mirror!

931
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:30,953
What an idiot.
It was just a mirror.

932
02:01:31,998 --> 02:01:33,863
There never was a painting there.

933
02:01:34,767 --> 02:01:37,201
What I saw was a reflection in the mirror.

934
02:01:42,575 --> 02:01:44,975
I saw the face of the murderer.

935
02:01:58,524 --> 02:02:01,721
Damn you! I hate you!

936
02:02:02,261 --> 02:02:05,924
You caused my son's death!
He had nothing to do with any of this!

937
02:02:06,466 --> 02:02:07,592
He was...

938
02:02:12,038 --> 02:02:17,442
He was only trying to... protect me.

939
02:02:18,311 --> 02:02:21,144
He never hurt anyone!

940
02:02:22,181 --> 02:02:25,116
What do you know about
what happened...?

941
02:02:30,757 --> 02:02:34,420
Now, don't worry.
Nothing's going to happen to you.

942
02:02:35,128 --> 02:02:38,325
It's alright. I'll take you to the clinic myself.

943
02:02:38,865 --> 02:02:42,892
No, I told you, I'm not going
back there again.

944
02:02:43,036 --> 02:02:47,063
I told you. You can't force me again.

945
02:02:47,507 --> 02:02:51,705
But it's for your own good, dear.
You heard what the doctor said.

946
02:02:52,345 --> 02:02:53,334
No.

947
02:02:56,549 --> 02:02:57,538
No.
