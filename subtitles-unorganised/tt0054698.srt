1
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,120
Hey, baby, what's going on here?

2
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,519
Oh, hi.

3
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,555
Miss Gorightly!

4
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,640
Some day... Some day...!

5
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,392
Miss Gorightly!

6
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,840
You go to the powder room
and that's the last l see.

7
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,080
- Now, Harry...
- Harry was the other guy.

8
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,640
l'm Sid Arbuck.
You like me, remember?

9
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,040
Miss Gorightly! l protest!

10
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,440
Darling, l am sorry,
but l lost my key.

11
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,240
That was two weeks ago.

12
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,880
You cannot keep ringing my bell.

13
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,320
You disturb me!
You must have a key made!

14
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,440
But l just lose them all.

15
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,280
- Come on. You like me.
- l worship you, Mr Arbuck.

16
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,000
- Good night.
- Wait! What is this?

17
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,480
You like me. l'm a liked guy.

18
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,640
You like me. l picked up
the cheque for five people...

19
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,200
Your friends.

20
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,960
When you wanted change for
the powder room l gave you $50.

21
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,712
That gives me rights.

22
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,120
ln 30 seconds l call the police!

23
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,240
All the time, disturbance!

24
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,760
l get no sleep!

25
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,600
l got to get my rest! l'm an artist!

26
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,160
l going to call vice squad on you!

27
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,600
Don't be angry. l won't do it again.

28
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,875
l might let you take those pictures.

29
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,880
When?

30
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,552
Some time.

31
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,240
Any time.

32
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,719
Good night.

33
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,951
l'm sorry to bother you.
l couldn't get the door open.

34
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,760
l guess they sent me
the upstairs key.

35
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,228
l couldn't get the
downstairs door open.

36
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,200
l said, l guess they sent me
the...upstairs key.

37
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,040
l couldn't get the downstairs
door open. Sorry to wake you.

38
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,268
That's all right.

39
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,520
lt could happen to anyone...
frequently does. Good night.

40
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,794
l hate to...

41
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,713
l hate to bother you,
but could l use the phone?

42
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,440
Sure.

43
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
Why not?

44
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,480
Thank you.

45
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,520
Well, this is a...

46
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,760
nice little place you've got here.

47
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,280
You just moved in, too, huh?

48
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,600
l've been here about a year.

49
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,000
Phone's over there.

50
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,149
Well, it was.

51
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,240
Oh, l remember.

52
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,074
l stuck it in the suitcase
to muffle the sound.

53
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,720
l'm...sorry.

54
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,200
ls he all right?

55
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,120
Sure. He's OK, aren't you, cat?

56
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,440
Poor old cat.

57
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,880
Poor slob. Poor slob without a name.

58
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,800
l don't have the right
to give him one.

59
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,400
We don't own each other.
We just met one day.

60
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,280
l won't own anything

61
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,520
until l find a place where
me and things go together.

62
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,840
l'm not sure where that is,
but l know what it's like.

63
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,440
lt's like Tiffany's.

64
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,040
Tiffany's?
You mean the jewellery store?

65
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,920
That's right.

66
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,760
l'm crazy about Tiffany's.

67
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,160
Listen.

68
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,000
You know those days
when you get the mean reds?

69
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,356
The mean reds? You mean the blues?

70
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,160
The blues are when you're fat
or it's raining, that's all.

71
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,040
The mean reds are horrible.

72
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,960
Suddenly, you're afraid
and don't know what of.

73
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,840
- Do you ever get that feeling?
- Sure.

74
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,720
When l get it, all that does any good

75
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,320
is to jump in a cab to Tiffany's.

76
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,480
Calms me down right away.

77
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,680
The quietness and proudness of it.

78
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,520
Nothing bad could happen there.

79
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,040
lf l could find a real place

80
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,235
that made me feel
like Tiffany's, then...

81
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,033
l'd buy some furniture
and give the cat a name.

82
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,320
l'm sorry. You wanted something.

83
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,120
The telephone.

84
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,000
l was supposed to meet somebody.

85
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,520
This is 1 0:00 Thursday morning?

86
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,360
l just got off a plane.
l'm not sure.

87
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,280
Thursday. ls this Thursday?

88
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,800
- l think so.
- lt can't be!

89
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,756
lt's too gruesome!

90
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,320
Well, what's so gruesome
about Thursday?

91
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,040
l never remember when it's coming up.

92
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,520
Wednesdays,
l generally don't go to bed

93
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,800
because l have to catch the 1 0:45.

94
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,240
They're so particular
about visiting hours.

95
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,040
Be a darling and look under the bed

96
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,395
for a pair of alligator shoes.

97
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,960
l've got to do something
about how l look.

98
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,080
l can't go to Sing Sing
with a green face.

99
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,200
Sing Sing?

100
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,880
lt's a ridiculous name for a prison.

101
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,240
Sounds more like an opera house.

102
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,400
Black, alligator.

103
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,680
All the visitors make an effort
to look their best.

104
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,200
lt's touching, the women wearing
their prettiest things.

105
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,280
l love them for it.
And l love the kids, too.

106
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,200
lt should be sad seeing kids
there, but it isn't.

107
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,960
They have ribbons in their hair
and shine on their shoes.

108
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,400
As l understand it,

109
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,120
you're going to visit somebody
at Sing Sing.

110
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,720
You can tell what kind of person
a man thinks you are

111
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
by the earrings he gives you.

112
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,680
l must say, the mind reels.

113
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,360
- May l ask whom?
- Whom l'm going to visit?

114
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,280
l guess that's what l mean.

115
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,480
l don't know if l should say.

116
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,640
They never told me not to.

117
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,920
Cross your heart and kiss your elbow.

118
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,840
l'll try.

119
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,320
You probably read about him -
Sally Tomato.

120
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,600
Sally Tomato?

121
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,960
Don't look so shocked.

122
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,160
They couldn't prove
he was in the Mafia,

123
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,080
much less head of it.

124
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,960
They only proved
he cheated his income tax.

125
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,080
He's a darling old man.

126
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,400
He wasn't my lover or anything.

127
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,720
l never knew him until
after he was in prison.

128
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,440
l've seen him every Thursday
for seven months.

129
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,120
l'd go even if he didn't pay me.

130
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,192
- Shoes.
- l only found one.

131
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,040
- He pays you?
- That's right. His lawyer does.

132
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,760
lf he is a lawyer, which l doubt.

133
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,560
He only has an answering service

134
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,313
and always wants to meet
at Hamburger Heaven.

135
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,280
There you are, you sneak. Thank you.

136
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,800
You're welcome.

137
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,120
Dress... Dress...

138
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,280
Here we are... Bag.

139
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,800
And a hat, too.

140
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,120
There we are.

141
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,160
Anyway, seven months ago,
this so-called lawyer

142
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,280
asked if l'd like
to cheer up an old man

143
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,760
and pick up 1 00 a week.

144
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,080
l told him, ''You've got
the wrong Holly Golightly.''

145
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,800
l do as well on trips
to the powder room.

146
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,760
Any chic gentleman will give
a girl $50 for the powder room.

147
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,960
And cab fare, that's another 50.

148
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,640
Then he said his client
was Sally Tomato.

149
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,720
Sally had seen me somewhere

150
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,880
and had admired me  la distance.

151
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,800
lt would be a good deed to visit him.

152
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,360
How could l say no?
lt was so wildly romantic.

153
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,510
How do l look?

154
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,880
Very good. l must say l'm amazed.

155
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,440
l could never have
done it without you.

156
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,880
Bag...

157
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,313
Call me any time.

158
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,280
l'm just upstairs,
as soon as l get moved in.

159
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,838
Bye, cat.

160
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,200
You mean he gives you $1 00
for an hour's conversation?

161
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,320
Mr O'Shaughnessy does when
l give him the weather report.

162
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,400
lt's none of my business,
but you could get in trouble.

163
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,356
Hold this for me.

164
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,200
And what do you mean,
weather report?

165
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,680
Just a message
l give Mr O'Shaughnessy,

166
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,960
so he knows l've been there.

167
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,880
Sally tells me things to say like...

168
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,720
''There's a hurricane in Cuba'',

169
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,680
''cloudy over Palermo'',
things like that.

170
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,478
Don't worry. l've taken care
of myself for a long time.

171
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,993
Taxi!

172
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,797
- l never could do that.
- lt's easy.

173
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,960
Paul.

174
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,350
l'm late. l know it.

175
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,400
Were you locked out?
Didn't you get the key?

176
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,358
Oh, darling. l'm so sorry.

177
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,400
No, l got the key.

178
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,920
Miss Golightly, my neighbour,
kindly let me in.

179
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,640
Miss Golightly's
on her way to Sing Sing.

180
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,000
Just visiting, of course.

181
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,320
Miss Golightly,

182
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,920
Mrs Falenson, my...decorator.

183
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,720
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

184
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,320
Darling. Let me look at you.

185
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,600
- Are you through?
- Was the flight ghastly?

186
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,149
Grand Central station,
and step on it, darling.

187
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,400
ls it only three weeks
since l left you in Rome?

188
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,920
Seems like years.

189
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,680
- You seen the apartment?
- Not yet.

190
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,520
lt was wicked of me,
but l couldn't resist.

191
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,640
l fixed it up without you.

192
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,160
l think it's darling,

193
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,359
but if you absolutely hate it,
we can start from scratch.

194
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,474
Hey, baby! Where you going?

195
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,350
Come on, baby. Open the door.

196
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,197
Ah, be a pal!

197
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,475
You're breaking up a beautiful party.

198
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,960
Come on, baby. Open the door.

199
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,880
Hey, the band's swinging.

200
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,553
Aw, come on, baby.

201
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,480
Once again, l must protest!

202
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,400
lf you don't stop
that phonograph now,

203
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,595
l'm going to call
the police department!

204
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,158
Yeah. That's more better.

205
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,557
What's the matter, baby?

206
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,790
Come on. You're a great kid.
Open the door.

207
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,758
Come on, baby. l'm waiting for you.

208
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,680
- lt's only me.
- Wait a minute. Miss...

209
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,800
Golightly. Holly Golightly.

210
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,440
l live downstairs.
We met this morning, remember?

211
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,953
Yeah.

212
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,519
lt's OK. She's gone.

213
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,480
She works late hours for a decorator.

214
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,000
There's the most
terrifying man downstairs.

215
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,440
He's sweet when he isn't drunk,
but some vino,

216
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,920
and, golly, quel beast.

217
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,673
lt got so tiresome,
l went out the window.

218
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,640
You can throw me out if you want,

219
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,680
but you looked so cosy
and your friend had gone,

220
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,274
and it was getting cold out there.

221
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,200
And l'd heard people in New York

222
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,040
never get to know their neighbours.

223
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,320
Well, how was Sing Sing?

224
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,471
Fine. l made the train
and everything.

225
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
And what's the weather report?

226
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,280
Small-craft warnings,

227
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,352
Block lsland to Hatteras...
whatever that means.

228
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,680
You know, you're sweet.
You really are.

229
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,000
And you look a little
like my brother Fred.

230
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,400
Do you mind if l call you Fred?

231
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,833
Not at all.

232
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,310
300. She's very generous.

233
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,560
ls it by the week, hour or what?

234
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,080
The party's over. Out.

235
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,320
Oh, Fred. Darling Fred, l'm sorry.

236
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,480
l didn't mean to hurt
your feelings. Don't be angry.

237
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,120
l was just saying l understand.

238
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,560
l understand completely.

239
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,160
Stick around. Make yourself a drink.

240
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,480
- Throw me my robe.
- Stay where you are.

241
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,160
You must be absolutely exhausted.

242
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,720
l mean, it's late,

243
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,632
and you were sound asleep
and everything.

244
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,360
l suppose you think
l'm trs fou or something.

245
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,280
No fouer than anybody else.

246
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,160
Yes, you do. Everybody does.
l don't mind.

247
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,391
lt's useful being top banana
in the shock department.

248
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,200
What do you do, anyway?

249
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,840
- l'm a writer, l guess.
- You guess? Don't you know?

250
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,920
OK. Positive statement.
Ringing affirmative.

251
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,831
l'm a writer.

252
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,280
The only writer l've ever been
out with is Benny Shacklett.

253
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,440
He's written a lot of TV stuff,
but quel rat.

254
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,920
Tell me, are you a real writer?

255
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,960
l mean, does anybody buy
what you write or anything?

256
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,110
They bought what's in that box.

257
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,269
Yours?

258
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,840
All these books?

259
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,760
There's just the one book,

260
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,320
1 2 copies of it.

261
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,840
''Nine Lives'' by Paul Varjak.

262
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,193
They're stories.

263
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,193
Nine of them.

264
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,872
Tell me one.

265
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,320
They're not the kind you can tell.

266
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,515
Too dirty?

267
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,800
Yeah, l suppose they're dirty, too,

268
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,600
but only incidentally.

269
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,280
Mainly they're angry,
sensitive, intensely felt,

270
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,560
and that dirtiest
of all words - promising.

271
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,678
So said The Times Book Review,
October 1 , 1 956.

272
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,920
- 1 956?
- That's right.

273
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,388
This a ratty question, but what
have you written lately?

274
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,320
Lately, l've been working on a novel.

275
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,360
- Lately, since 1 956?
- lt takes time.

276
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,960
- l want to get it right.
- So no more stories.

277
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,920
l'm supposed to not fritter
my talent on little things.

278
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,600
l'm saving it for the big one.

279
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,760
Do you write every day?

280
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,120
Sure.

281
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,600
- Today?
- Sure.

282
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,880
lt's a beautiful typewriter.

283
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,880
Of course.

284
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,000
lt writes nothing but sensitive,
intensely felt, promising prose.

285
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,480
There's no ribbon in it.

286
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,360
There isn't?

287
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,555
No.

288
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,040
Something you said this morning
has bothered me all day.

289
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,640
What's that?

290
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,000
Do they really give you $50
for the powder room?

291
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,760
Of course.

292
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,120
You must do very well.

293
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,318
l'm trying to save,
but l'm not very good at it.

294
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,600
You know, you do look
a lot like Fred.

295
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,000
l haven't seen him since
l was 1 4, when l left home.

296
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,440
He was already 6'2''.

297
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,600
lt must have been
the peanut butter that did it.

298
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,680
Everybody thought he was dotty,
the way he ate peanut butter.

299
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,400
But he wasn't dotty,

300
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,359
just sweet and vague
and...terribly slow.

301
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,600
Poor Fred. He's in the army now.

302
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,068
lt's best until l get enough money.

303
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,520
- And then?
- And then Fred and l...

304
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,400
l went to Mexico once.

305
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,720
lt's a wonderful place
for raising horses.

306
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,760
l saw one place near the sea that...

307
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,520
Fred's very good with horses.

308
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Even land in Mexico costs something.

309
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,720
Whatever l do, there's never
more than $200 in the bank.

310
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,711
lt can't be 4:30.

311
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,156
lt just can't.

312
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,992
Do you mind if l just
get in with you for a minute?

313
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,800
lt's all right. Really, it is.

314
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,155
We're friends, that's all.

315
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,674
We are friends, aren't we?

316
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,913
Sure.

317
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:35,160
OK, let's don't say another word.

318
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,594
Let's just go to sleep.

319
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,479
Where are you, Fred?

320
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,753
lt's cold.

321
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,553
There's snow and...wind.

322
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,593
What is it?

323
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,519
Why are you crying?

324
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,040
lf we're going to be friends,
let's get one thing straight.

325
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,076
l hate snoops.

326
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,437
- Yeah.
- Lucille, darling?

327
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,560
l've been trying
desperately to reach you.

328
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,440
Bill just got back...

329
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,240
a day early, the beast...

330
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,680
so l'll have to beg off.

331
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,800
You'll explain
to the rest of the girls?

332
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,600
You're a darling.

333
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,080
Maybe we can have
a long lunch tomorrow.

334
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,360
- l'll phone you in the morning.
- Whatever you say.

335
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,200
You'll manage to survive
without me tonight?

336
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,035
Sure. l might even take a wild,
boyish fling at writing.

337
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,478
- Good night.
- Good night.

338
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,720
Got yourself stuffed,
huh, Polly, baby?

339
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,631
Serves you right, big mouth.

340
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,720
- Buon giorno.
- Huh?

341
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,551
Aren't you drinking?

342
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,560
You have pockets or something?
What do you go by?

343
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,400
What's your name?
What do you call yourself?

344
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,640
- lrving.
- Perfect, perfect.

345
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,232
That's wonderful, lrving.

346
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,433
l'll be right back, lrving, baby.

347
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,520
Yeah? Kid's still in the shower.
You expected?

348
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,760
l was invited. That what you mean?

349
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,600
Don't get all tense. Come on in.

350
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,353
lt's a party - lot of characters
come who aren't expected.

351
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,720
l'll buy you a drink. You drink?

352
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,870
Then l'll buy you a drink.

353
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,400
Hey, honey, your skirt's split there.

354
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,920
- What do you drink?
- Bourbon.

355
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,640
- On the rocks?
- Yeah... No. With water.

356
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,960
- Want rocks first?
- Yeah. Not too much.

357
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,320
All right. That'll set you free.

358
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,200
- Know the kid long?
- Not very. l live upstairs.

359
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,000
Look at this place.
lt's unbelievable. What a dump!

360
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,480
What do you think?

361
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,835
- About what?
- ls she or isn't she?

362
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,070
Wait a minute. Hold it.

363
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,920
- Harriet!
- Hi, JB.

364
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,280
''JB''? What's that?

365
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,120
- You know Gil.
- Yeah. How are you?

366
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,510
- How about a drink?
- ln the kitchen.

367
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,560
So... Oh, honey, that is you.

368
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,200
Fred, darling,
l'm so glad you could come.

369
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,840
l brought you a present
for the bookcase.

370
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,600
You're sweet.

371
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,520
Doesn't that look nice?
Give me a cigarette, OJ.

372
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,320
OJ's a great agent.
He knows a lot of phone numbers.

373
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,280
What's Jerry Wald's phone number?

374
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,800
Come on, lay off.

375
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,680
Call him and tell him
Fred's a genius.

376
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,880
Stop blushing, Fred.
You didn't say it. l did.

377
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,440
Quit stalling. How will you make
Fred rich and famous?

378
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,240
Let Fred and me
settle that, huh, puppy?

379
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,520
OK, but remember, l'm the agent.

380
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,875
He's already got a decorator,
l'm the agent.

381
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,760
Hold it.

382
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,800
Hi, boys. Come on in.

383
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,109
Everything you need's
in the kitchen.

384
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,160
So, listen, Fred, baby...

385
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,200
- No, it's Paul, baby.
- l thought it was Fred, baby.

386
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,200
- ls she or isn't she?
- What?

387
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,800
A phoney.

388
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,640
l don't know. l don't think so.

389
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,440
Well, you're wrong - she is.

390
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,320
On the other hand, you're right,
because she's a real phoney.

391
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,240
She honestly believes
all this phoney junk.

392
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,880
Now, l sincerely
like the kid. l do.

393
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,600
l'm sensitive. That's why.

394
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,320
You got to be sensitive
to like the kid.

395
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,600
lt's a streak of the poet.

396
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,120
You known her long?

397
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,880
l discovered her. l'm OJ Berman.
Couple of years ago...

398
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,640
She was just a kid.
Lot of style, class...

399
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,600
- Lot of what?
- Class.

400
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,200
But you didn't know whether
she was a hillbilly or an Okie.

401
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,000
Know how long it took
to smooth that accent?

402
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
One year. Know how?

403
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,920
We gave her French lessons.

404
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,240
Figured once
she could imitate French,

405
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,760
she could imitate English.

406
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,640
Finally, l arranged
for a little screen test.

407
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,760
The night before - l could've
killed myself- the phone rings.

408
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:59,840
l pick it up. She says, ''lt's
Holly. l'm in New York.''

409
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,200
l say, ''You got
a screen test tomorrow.''

410
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,520
l say, ''Get back here!''
She says, ''l don't want to.''

411
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,200
''What do you mean? What do you want?''

412
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,680
She says, ''When l find out,
l'll let you know.''

413
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,200
- Fred, baby...
- lt's Paul, baby.

414
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,440
Sure. Don't tell me
she isn't a phoney.

415
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,352
lrving!
Honey, lrving, where you been?

416
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,800
Mike, darling, l tried
reaching you all day long.

417
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,720
Your answering service
doesn't answer.

418
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,473
That's the trouble
with answering services...

419
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,829
And after all that she said...

420
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,400
- Time, darling.
- What?

421
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
The time?

422
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,520
- You have a watch?
- No.

423
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,193
- Oh, let me see. 6:45.
- Thank you.

424
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,436
Really, was that necessary?

425
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,080
This is some party. Who are
all these people, anyhow?

426
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,360
Who knows? The word gets out.

427
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,510
You don't mind, do you, darling?

428
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,874
Reinforcements.

429
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,919
Right in there.

430
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,760
Holly, darling!

431
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,600
What's that?

432
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,040
Mag Wildwood.

433
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,960
She's a model, believe it
or not, and a thumping bore.

434
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,428
But look at the goodies with her.

435
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,000
He's all right,

436
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,360
if you like handsome,
rich-looking men

437
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,720
with passionate natures
and too many teeth.

438
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,836
l mean the other one.

439
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,518
- The other one?
- He's Rusty Trawler.

440
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,555
He's the ninth richest man
in America under 50.

441
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,880
That's remarkable information
to have at your fingertips.

442
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,280
l keep track of these things.

443
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,990
- Excuse me. You owe me 47...
- Hold this a minute, darling.

444
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,560
Mag, darling,
what are you doing here?

445
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,040
l was upstairs
working with Yunioshi...

446
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,320
Easter stuff for the Bazaar.

447
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,160
Then these two nice boys
came to pick me up.

448
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,600
lt was a mistake, of course.
My wires got crossed somewhere.

449
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,520
They were both very sweet about it.

450
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,800
May l present Jos Silva Pereira?

451
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,234
He's from Brazil.

452
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,390
Miss Golightly.

453
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,600
Very kind of you to allow me
to attend your party.

454
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,680
l'm so interested
in North American culture.

455
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,560
l've been already
to the Statue of Liberty

456
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,480
and to the restaurant Automatique,

457
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,960
but this is the first time

458
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,840
l'm in a typical North American home.

459
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,120
Wouldn't he just melt in your mouth?

460
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,840
And this is Mr Rusty Trawler.

461
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,040
Miss Golightly.

462
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,880
You're not vexed at me
for bringing them?

463
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,400
- Of course not, darling.
- l'm glad.

464
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,280
Now, who's going
to bring me a bourbon?

465
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,400
- OJ.
- Yeah.

466
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,520
Would you get Miss Wildwood a drink?

467
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,880
Which one's Miss Wildwood?

468
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,920
Mr Berman, we haven't been
formally introduced,

469
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,760
but l'm Mag Wildwood
from Wildwood, Arkansaw.

470
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,080
That's...hill country.

471
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,960
Now, you just make yourself
right at home.

472
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,480
Don't trouble yourself.

473
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,760
l'm contented to observe
the customs of your country.

474
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,280
OK, you do that.

475
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,200
Now, come along, Mr Trawler.

476
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,033
Let's see what we
can find to amuse you.

477
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,040
l wasn't supposed to pick you up.

478
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,600
At the last minute, l had...

479
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,353
Look, l wasn't supposed
to pick you up.

480
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,239
Yes?

481
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,920
Miss Gorightly!
This time l'm warning you!

482
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,072
l am definitely this time
going to calling the police!

483
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,960
Good evening!

484
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,280
ls it something important?

485
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,080
No. Just the guy upstairs
complaining about the noise.

486
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,520
He's angry.

487
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,200
He did mention something
about calling the police.

488
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,680
Oh, the police... The police?

489
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,309
That l cannot have. l'd better
find Miss Wildwood and go.

490
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,080
To think l'd find a beau of mine

491
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,960
mousing after
some cheap Hollywood trash.

492
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,200
Mag, darling, you're being a bore.

493
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,080
Shut up!

494
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,360
You know what's going
to happen to you?

495
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,840
l'm going to march you to the
zoo and feed you to the yak.

496
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,638
Just as soon as l finish this drink.

497
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,194
Timber!

498
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,991
Sorry.

499
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,280
- Oh, good evening, Ed.
- lt's Paul, baby.

500
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,600
You remember lrving, don't you?

501
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,640
- This is Jos.
- Nice to meet you.

502
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,000
Yes.

503
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,513
Jewel thieves.

504
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,920
Sally helps me with my accounts.

505
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,560
l have no head for figures at all.

506
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,240
l'm trying desperately
to save some money.

507
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,040
l just can't seem to.

508
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,840
He makes me write down everything.

509
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,000
What l get, what l spend.

510
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,390
l had an cheque account.
l got rid of that.

511
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:40,508
He feels it's better to operate
on a cash basis, taxwise.

512
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,320
Some day, take this book,
turn it into a novel.

513
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,120
Everything is there.
Just fill in the details.

514
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,920
Would be good for some laughs.

515
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,200
No. No, l don't think so.

516
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,080
This book would break the heart.

517
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,760
''Mr Fitzsimmons...powder room, $50.

518
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,280
''Less $1 8... Repair
one black satin dress.

519
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,520
''Cat food, 27 cents.''

520
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,480
Sally, darling, please stop -
you're making me blush!

521
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,760
But you're right about Jack.
He's an absolute rat.

522
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,280
l guess, of course,
l don't know anybody but rats.

523
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,589
Except, of course, Fred here.

524
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,480
You do think Fred is nice, don't you?

525
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,029
For you... l hope he is.

526
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,200
Goodbye, Uncle Sally. Till next week.

527
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,560
Goodbye, Uncle Sally.

528
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,280
Goodbye and don't forget
to send that book.

529
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,320
l won't.

530
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,480
Oh, what about the weather report?

531
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,480
Oh, yes.

532
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,393
Snow flurries expected
this weekend in New Orleans.

533
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,560
Snow flurries expected
this weekend in New Orleans?!

534
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,400
lsn't that just the weirdest?

535
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,280
l bet they haven't had
snow in New Orleans for years.

536
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,874
l don't know how he thinks them up.

537
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,280
Moon River

538
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,080
Wider than a mile

539
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:33,880
l'm crossin' you in style

540
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,553
Some day

541
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,880
Oh, dream maker

542
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,280
You heartbreaker

543
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,400
Wherever you're goin'

544
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,720
l'm goin' your way

545
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,680
Two drifters

546
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,240
Off to see the world

547
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,680
There's such a lot of world

548
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,194
To see

549
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:17,360
We're after

550
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,200
The same

551
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,120
Rainbow's end

552
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,556
Waitin' 'round the bend

553
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,560
My huckleberry friend

554
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:39,439
Moon River

555
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,829
And me

556
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,760
- Hi.
- Hi.

557
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,200
- What you doin'?
- Writing.

558
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,553
Good.

559
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,720
Well, hello.

560
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,640
- What's wrong?
- l don't know.

561
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,960
lt's probably nothing.

562
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,120
l want to see if he's still there.

563
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,908
See if who's still there?
What are you talking about?

564
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,798
Look.

565
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,756
See? l noticed him
yesterday afternoon.

566
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,960
l didn't want
to sound neurotic, but...

567
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,040
- when he's there again today...
- Who do you think he is?

568
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,320
lt could be anybody, of course,

569
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,800
but what crossed my mind was...

570
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,917
suppose Bill's
having us watched, huh?

571
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,675
OK, l'll take care of this.

572
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,000
No. No, don't.

573
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,760
lf that's it,
you'll only make it worse.

574
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,440
l'll be careful. You wait here.

575
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,320
Darling, please don't.
l don't think you should.

576
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,760
Take it easy.

577
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,435
l just want to find out
what this is about.

578
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,070
All right, what do you want?

579
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,998
Son, l need a friend.

580
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,520
That's me, that's her,

581
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,750
that's her brother Fred.

582
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,992
You're Holly's father?

583
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,640
Her name ain't Holly.

584
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,800
She was Lula Mae Barnes.

585
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,760
Was till she married me.

586
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,637
l'm her husband Doc Golightly.

587
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,839
Paul Varjak.

588
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,600
l'm a horse doctor... Animal man.

589
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,398
Do some farming, too,
near Tulip, Texas.

590
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,640
Her brother Fred's
getting out of the army soon.

591
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,120
Lula Mae belongs home with her
husband, brother and children.

592
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,075
Children?

593
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,600
Them's her children.

594
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,560
She's got four children?

595
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,720
Now, son, l didn't claim
they was her natural children.

596
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,320
Their own precious mother -
precious woman -

597
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:09,720
passed away July 4th, 1 955,
the year of the drought.

598
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,480
When l married Lula Mae,
she was going on 1 4.

599
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,280
You might think a person of 1 4
wouldn't know their own mind.

600
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,760
But you take Lula Mae.

601
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,637
She was an exceptional person.

602
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:31,560
She just plumb broke our hearts
when she run off like she done.

603
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,920
Just plain had no reason.

604
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,840
All the housework
was done by her daughter.

605
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,920
Lula Mae could take it easy.

606
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,720
That woman got positively fat,

607
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,360
while her brother,
he growed up into a giant,

608
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,960
which is a sight different
from how they come to us.

609
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,840
A couple of wild young'uns, they was.

610
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,320
l caught 'em stealing milk
and turkey eggs.

611
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:58,000
They'd been living with
some mean, no-account people

612
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,480
about 1 00 mile east of Tulip.

613
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,040
She had cause to run from that house.

614
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,160
Never had none to leave mine.

615
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,799
What about her brother?
Didn't he leave?

616
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:13,160
No. We had Fred with us
till the army took him.

617
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,680
That's why l come.

618
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,640
l had a letter from him.
He's getting out in February.

619
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,880
That's why l come to get her.

620
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,715
Lula Mae's place is with her
husband, children and brother.

621
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,714
The prize from
a Cracker Jack box. Want it?

622
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,157
Never could understand
why that woman run off.

623
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,720
Don't tell me she weren't happy.

624
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,000
Talky as a jay bird she was,

625
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,880
with something to say
on every subject.

626
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,480
Better than the radio.

627
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,680
The night l proposed,
l cried like a baby.

628
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,600
She said, ''Why are you crying?
We'll be married.

629
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,000
''l never been married before.''

630
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,880
l laughed and hugged
and squeezed her.

631
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:58,075
''Never been married before.''

632
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,039
Listen, son,
l advise you l need a friend,

633
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,040
'cause l don't want
to surprise or scare her none.

634
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,315
Let her know l'm here.

635
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,876
Will you do that, son?

636
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,600
Yeah, sure, Doc.
lf that's what you want.

637
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,318
Come on.

638
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,880
All right.

639
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,518
Coming.

640
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,840
Oh, darling, l'm on my way out.

641
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,600
l'm half an hour late.

642
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,040
Maybe we can have a drink tomorrow.

643
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,480
Sure, Lula Mae...

644
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,835
if you're still here tomorrow.

645
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,395
Oh, please, where is he?

646
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,953
Gosh.

647
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,515
Gee, honey, don't they feed you
up here? You're so skinny.

648
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,200
- Hi, Doc.
- Gosh, Lula Mae...

649
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,872
Kingdom come!

650
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,800
What's the matter? You all right?

651
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,520
l guess so... No, l'm not.
Will you help me?

652
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,760
- lf l can.
- Come to the bus station.

653
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,760
He still thinks l'm going back.

654
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,560
l can't play it alone.

655
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,320
He's your husband.

656
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,280
- No, he's not.
- He's not?

657
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,280
lt was annulled ages ago.
He just won't accept it.

658
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,320
Please, Fred.
l'll say you're seeing us off.

659
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,799
Don't say anything.

660
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,550
Just meet us out front
in about an hour. Please?

661
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,640
You wait right here, honey.

662
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,119
l'll get the bag.

663
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,440
Why don't l get some magazines?

664
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,080
Please, Fred, don't leave me.

665
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,880
Attention, please.

666
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,360
Leaving from platform 5,
through coach to Dallas...

667
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,040
Philadelphia, Columbus,
lndianapolis, Terre Haute,

668
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,320
St Louis, Tulsa,
Oklahoma City, Denison, Dallas.

669
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,480
Come on, Lula Mae. That's us.

670
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,640
Doc, l'm not coming with you.

671
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,640
Come on. Let's walk quietly.

672
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,880
l'll try and help you
understand. Help me, Fred.

673
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,400
l appreciate your help, but
it's between Lula Mae and me.

674
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,753
Sure, Doc.

675
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,280
l love you, Lula Mae.

676
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,280
l know you do, and
that's just the trouble.

677
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,720
lt's a mistake you always made,
trying to love a wild thing.

678
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,840
You were always
lugging home wild things -

679
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,840
a hawk with a broken wing,

680
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,200
a full-grown wildcat
with a broken leg...

681
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,680
Remember?

682
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,720
There's something...

683
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,160
You mustn't give your heart
to a wild thing.

684
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,600
The more you do,
the stronger they get,

685
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,320
until they're strong enough
to fly into a tree,

686
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,800
then to higher trees,
then to the sky.

687
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,400
There's something l got to tell you.

688
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,640
Excuse me.

689
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,313
Couple weeks ago,
l got a letter from Fred.

690
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,400
From Fred?
He's all right, isn't he?

691
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,680
Yeah, he's fine, l guess.

692
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,600
He's getting out of the army
in February.

693
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,480
ln February?

694
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,960
Well, that's only four months.

695
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,280
So, you got to come back.

696
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,120
Your place is with us.

697
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,840
Doc, you've got to understand,
l can't come back.

698
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,200
You got to understand
what l'm saying.

699
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,400
l don't want to pressure you,
but l got to.

700
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,800
lf you don't come,

701
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,680
l'll have to tell young Fred

702
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,040
he better sign up for another hitch.

703
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,080
Don't do that.
Don't write that to him.

704
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,000
l'll write him and say
l want him with me.

705
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,440
l'll take care of him.

706
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,080
You're talking crazy, Lula Mae.

707
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:08,312
Doc, stop calling me that.
l'm not Lula Mae any more.

708
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,320
All right, Lula Mae.

709
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,118
l guess you know what you're doing.

710
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,120
Keep an eye on her, will you, son?

711
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,400
At least see she eats
something once in a while.

712
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,753
Sure, Doc.

713
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,917
So skinny.

714
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,440
Please, Doc. Please understand.

715
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,353
l love you,
but l'm not Lula Mae any more.

716
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,716
l'm not.

717
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,440
You know the terrible thing,
darling?

718
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,920
l am still Lula Mae.
Fourteen, stealing turkey eggs

719
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,150
and running through a briar patch.

720
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,716
Except now l call it
having the mean reds.

721
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,320
Well, it's still too early
to go to Tiffany's.

722
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,400
l guess the next best thing
is a drink.

723
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,280
Yes, l very much need a drink.

724
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,200
Buy me one, Fred, darling?

725
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,553
Sure.

726
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,877
Only promise not to take me home
until l'm drunk.

727
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,717
Until l'm very drunk indeed.

728
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,040
Do you think she's talented?

729
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,760
Deeply and importantly talented?

730
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,200
No.

731
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,920
Amusingly and superficially
talented, yes,

732
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:05,038
but deeply and importantly, no.

733
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,520
Gracious.

734
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,159
Do you think she's handsomely paid?

735
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,591
Oh, indeed.

736
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,880
Well, let me tell you something.

737
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,360
lf l had her money,
l'd be richer than she is.

738
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:29,200
- How do you figure that?
- l'd keep the candy store.

739
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,440
Old Sally Tomato -
that's my candy store.

740
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:34,560
l'd always keep Sally.

741
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,597
That's why l'd be richer than she is.

742
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,354
We'd better get a little more air.

743
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,680
..every Tom, Dick and Harry...

744
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,120
No. Correction.

745
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,440
Every Tom, Dick and Sid -
Harry was his friend.

746
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,360
Anyway, every Tom, Dick and Sid

747
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,680
thinks if he takes a girl to dinner,

748
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:07,200
she'll just curl up in a little
furry ball at his feet, right?

749
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,920
l have by actual count
been taken to dinner

750
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,760
by 26 different rats
in the last two months.

751
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,880
27, if you count Benny Shacklett,

752
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,560
who's in many ways a super rat.

753
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,552
- l forgot my key.
- Never mind. l buzzed Yunioshi.

754
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,880
Do you know something funny?

755
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,760
ln spite of the fact these rats
fork up $50

756
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,671
for the powder room
like little dolls...

757
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,800
l find l have $9 less
in the bank account

758
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,720
than l had six months ago.

759
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,840
So, my darling Fred,

760
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,080
l have tonight made
a very serious decision.

761
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,513
And what is that?

762
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,440
No longer will l play the field.

763
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,160
- Congratulations.
- The field stinks...

764
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,000
both economically and socially,

765
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,956
and l'm giving it up.

766
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,680
This time l'm calling
the police, the fire department,

767
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,600
and the New York State
Housing Commission,

768
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,920
and, if necessary,
the Board of Health!

769
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:11,400
Quiet, up there. You want
to wake the whole house?

770
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,920
As Miss Golightly was saying

771
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,200
before she was so rudely interrupted,

772
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,520
Miss Golightly
further announces her intention

773
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,440
to devote her
not inconsiderable talents

774
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,160
to the immediate capture,

775
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,440
for the purpose of matrimony,

776
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,960
of Mr Rutherford...

777
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:35,880
Rusty to his friends, of whom
l'm sure he has many, Trawler.

778
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,120
- Who?
- Rusty Trawler.

779
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,400
You met him at my party.

780
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,320
He came with Mag Wildwood.

781
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,840
Not the beautiful Latin type,

782
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:49,760
the other one - the one
that looks like a pig.

783
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,200
Remember?

784
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,193
The ninth richest man
in America under 50?

785
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,880
Ah...

786
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,880
Do l detect a look
of disapproval in your eye?

787
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,400
Tough beans, buddy,

788
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,680
cos that's the way it's gonna be.

789
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,360
Hi, cat.

790
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:13,035
- Holly, you're drunk.
- True.

791
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,840
Absolutely true.
True, but irrevelant.

792
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,796
What are you doing?

793
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,320
So l think we should have a drink

794
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:25,600
to the new
Mrs Rusty Trawler...me!

795
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,440
Hey, take it easy.

796
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,680
What's up,
don't you think l can do it?

797
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:34,240
Tell me. l'm interested.
Don't you think l can?

798
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,960
You heard the Doc.

799
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,800
My brother gets out in February.

800
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,920
The Doc won't take him back.

801
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,480
lt's all up to me.

802
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,480
l don't know why
you don't understand.

803
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:49,120
l need money, and l'll do
whatever l have to do to get it.

804
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,600
So this time next month,

805
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,990
l'll be the new Mrs Rusty Trawler.

806
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,880
l think we should have
a little drink to that.

807
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,997
lt's all gone. lsn't that too bad?

808
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,197
Got any whisky upstairs?

809
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,000
But you've had enough.

810
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,560
Go ahead. Get the whisky.

811
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,994
l'll pay you for it.

812
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,320
Holly, please.

813
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:22,360
No, no, you disapprove of me,
and l do not accept drinks

814
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,600
from gentlemen who disapprove of me.

815
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:28,115
l'll pay for my own whisky
and don't forget it.

816
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:33,160
l do not accept drinks
from disapproving gentlemen.

817
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,160
Especially not
disapproving gentlemen

818
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,520
who are kept by other ladies.

819
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,320
So take it.

820
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,995
You should be used
to taking money from ladies.

821
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,760
lf l were you, l'd be more
careful with my money.

822
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,719
Rusty Trawler is too hard
a way of earning it.

823
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,120
lt should take you
exactly four seconds

824
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:03,360
to cross from here to that door.

825
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,998
l'll give you two.

826
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,800
Hi. l wanted to talk
about the other night,

827
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:23,720
then l saw the paper, and...

828
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,920
Well, actually, l'm kind
of embarrassed about it,

829
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,880
but since it concerns you,

830
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,760
l thought l should
talk about it in person.

831
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,228
- What?
- What?

832
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,680
Oh, the earplugs.

833
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,720
l can't go through
the whole thing again.

834
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,040
lt's sufficient to say,

835
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,640
l've come to make up.

836
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:46,680
As an added inducement,
l have all kinds of news.

837
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,320
Can l come in?

838
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,760
l guess so.

839
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,040
Just a minute.
Do l have a nightgown on?

840
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:56,120
No, l don't. Would you turn
around for a second?

841
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,240
Never mind. That's corny anyway.

842
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,440
l'll turn around myself.

843
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:01,793
Come in.

844
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,880
Have...you seen the paper?

845
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:09,320
Rusty, you mean?

846
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,360
Yes. l know all about it.

847
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,720
Certainly had him
pegged wrong, didn't l?

848
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,200
l thought he was just a rat,

849
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,880
but he was a super rat all along.

850
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,600
A super rat in rat's clothing.

851
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,080
You don't even know the best part.

852
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,720
Not only was he a super rat,

853
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,840
he was also broke.

854
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:33,120
Broke! l mean, but not a farthing.

855
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:36,560
His family has money,
but he personally is broke.

856
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:40,200
lt turns out he owes $700,000.

857
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:44,040
Can you imagine
anyone owing $700,000?

858
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,560
$43, yes.

859
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,880
Anyway, that's why he decided

860
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,720
to marry the queen
of the pig people.

861
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,200
l'll tell you one thing,
Fred, darling,

862
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,120
l'd marry you
for your money in a minute.

863
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,280
- Would you marry me for mine?
- ln a minute.

864
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:03,556
l guess it's lucky
neither of us is rich.

865
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,433
Yeah.

866
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,877
Oh, Fred, darling,
l'm so glad to see you.

867
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,640
What have you been doing?

868
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,471
Writing, mostly.

869
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,640
l sold a story.
Just got word this morning.

870
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,440
Oh, that's marvellous!

871
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,320
lt really is, but...

872
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,720
Only how does your decorator
friend feel about it?

873
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:35,280
Aren't you supposed
to be saving yourself?

874
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,720
You know something?

875
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,680
l haven't got around
to telling her yet.

876
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,800
Look, why don't we go have a drink

877
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,840
or take a walk to celebrate?

878
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:47,320
All right. There's some
champagne in the icebox.

879
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:51,080
Why don't you open it
while l get dressed?

880
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:55,160
l haven't drunk champagne
before breakfast before.

881
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,880
With breakfast on several occasions,

882
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,560
but never before, before.

883
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,560
l've got a wonderful idea.

884
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,320
We'll spend the day
doing things we've never done.

885
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:07,880
We'll take turns.
First you, then me.

886
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:12,032
Of course, l can't think
of anything l've never done.

887
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:29,360
l've never been
for a walk in the morning.

888
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,400
Not in New York.

889
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,840
l've walked here at six,
but l consider that night.

890
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:38,276
- Do you think it counts?
- Sure. Now we're even.

891
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,680
- Don't you just love it?
- Love what?

892
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,636
Tiffany's.

893
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,880
lsn't it wonderful?

894
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,480
Nothing bad could happen to you
in a place like this?

895
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,680
l don't give a hoot about
jewellery, except diamonds.

896
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,432
Like that.

897
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,360
What do you think?

898
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,839
Well...

899
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:31,640
Personally, l think it's tacky
to wear diamonds before 40.

900
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:34,760
You're right, but meantime,
you should have something.

901
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,280
l'll wait.

902
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,600
No. l'm buying you a present.

903
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,760
You bought me a typewriter
ribbon, and it brought luck.

904
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,920
But Tiffany's can be expensive.

905
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,040
l've got my cheque and $1 0.

906
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,360
l wouldn't let you cash your cheque,

907
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:52,160
but a present for $1 0 or under,
that l'll accept.

908
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:56,039
Of course, l don't know
what we'll find here for $1 0.

909
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,800
May l help you?

910
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,000
Perhaps. We're looking
for a present for the lady.

911
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,360
Certainly, sir. ls there
something you had in mind?

912
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:17,360
Well, we had considered diamonds.

913
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:21,239
No offence, but the lady feels
diamonds are tacky for her.

914
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,920
Oh, l think they're
divine on older women,

915
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,440
but they're not right for me,
you understand.

916
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,680
- Certainly.
- ln fairness, l should explain

917
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,920
there's also
the problem of finance.

918
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,560
We can only afford
to spend...a limited amount.

919
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,720
May l ask how limited?

920
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:43,800
- $1 0.
- $1 0?

921
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,840
That was the outside figure, yes.

922
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:49,200
- l see.
- Do you have anything for $1 0?

923
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,560
Frankly, madam,
within that price range,

924
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:54,240
the variety of merchandise
is rather limited.

925
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,600
However, l do think
we might have, let's see...

926
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,640
Strictly a novelty,
you understand...

927
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,680
For the lady and gentleman
who has everything,

928
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:05,320
a sterling silver telephone dialler.

929
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:08,400
That's $6.75, including tax.

930
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,120
A sterling silver telephone dialler.

931
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:14,840
Yes, sir. That's $6.75,
including federal tax.

932
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:18,040
Well, the price is right,
but l must say,

933
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:21,720
l'd hoped for something more,
how shall l say it,

934
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,517
romantic in feeling.

935
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,840
- What do you think?
- A silver telephone dialler?

936
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:30,628
l certainly think it's handsome,
but, well, you do understand.

937
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,200
Well, we tried, but...

938
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,280
We could have
something engraved, couldn't we?

939
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,840
Yes, l suppose so.

940
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,280
Yes, indeed.

941
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,800
The problem is, you'd have
to buy something first

942
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:47,160
in order to have some object
on which to place the engraving.

943
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,480
You see the difficulty?

944
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:52,760
Well, we could
have this engraved, couldn't we?

945
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,671
l think it would be very smart.

946
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,440
This, l take it,
was not purchased at Tiffany's?

947
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:03,120
No. Actually, it was purchased
concurrent with...

948
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,360
well, actually, it came inside a...

949
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,875
- a box of Cracker Jack.
- l see.

950
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,840
Do they still really have prizes
in Cracker Jack boxes?

951
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,120
Oh, yes.

952
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,880
That's nice to know.

953
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:21,520
lt gives one a feeling
of solidarity,

954
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:24,760
almost of continuity with
the past, that sort of thing.

955
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:27,360
Would Tiffany's really
engrave it for us?

956
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:30,000
They wouldn't feel it
beneath them or anything?

957
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,120
Well, it is rather unusual, madam,

958
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:35,920
but you'll find that Tiffany's
is very understanding.

959
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,400
lf you would tell me the initials,

960
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:42,359
l think we could have something
ready for you in the morning.

961
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:46,597
Didn't l tell you
this was a lovely place?

962
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,880
What is this place, anyway?

963
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,800
You wanted to sit down.
lt's the public library.

964
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:15,440
- You've never been here?
- No. That makes two for me.

965
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:16,960
l don't see any books.

966
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,837
They're in there.

967
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,236
See?

968
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:31,360
Each one of these drawers
is stuffed with little cards.

969
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,560
Each little card
is a book or an author.

970
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,320
l think that's fascinating.

971
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,000
V-A-R-J-A-K.

972
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,353
Really?

973
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:45,160
Look. lsn't it marvellous?

974
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,000
There you are, right
in the public library.

975
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,480
Varjak, Paul. Nine Lives.

976
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,200
Then a lot of numbers.

977
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:55,840
Do they really have
the book itself, live?

978
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,956
Sure. Follow me.

979
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,358
Number 57. That's us.

980
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,400
57, please.

981
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,320
Nine Lives by Varjak, Paul.

982
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,400
Have you read it?
lt's marvellous.

983
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,280
- l'm afraid l haven't.
- You should. He wrote it.

984
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,800
He's Varjak, Paul, in person.

985
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,520
She doesn't believe me.

986
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,440
Show her your driver's licence

987
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,920
or Diner's Club Card or something.

988
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,040
He is the author. Cross my heart
and kiss my elbow.

989
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,000
Would you kindly lower your voice?

990
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,840
Autograph it.

991
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,240
Wouldn't that be nice?
Make it more personal?

992
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,880
Really, Miss...

993
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,920
Go ahead. Don't be so stuck up,
autograph it.

994
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,800
What shall l say?

995
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,920
Something sentimental, l think.

996
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,240
What are you doing? Stop that!

997
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,520
You're defacing public property.

998
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,360
Well, if that's how you feel.

999
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,200
Come on. Let's get out of here.

1000
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:57,988
l don't think this place
is half as nice as Tiffany's.

1001
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:13,560
Did you ever steal anything
from a 5-and-1 0

1002
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,120
when you were a kid?

1003
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,160
No. l'm the sensitive,
bookish type. Did you?

1004
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:22,200
l used to. l still do now
and then, to keep my hand in.

1005
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,720
Come on.

1006
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:26,632
You've never done it,
and it's your turn.

1007
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,717
l can't see.

1008
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,875
Hi, cat.
Lady of the house at home?

1009
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,237
Trick or treat?

1010
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:19,000
You're crazy.
You know that, don't you?

1011
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,160
But l love you anyway.

1012
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,840
- Tooley.
- Yeah?

1013
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,229
l've...got to talk to you.

1014
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,753
All right.

1015
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,437
You want a drink?

1016
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,200
lf this is a serious discussion,

1017
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,760
and suddenly
l'm terribly afraid it is,

1018
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,560
you'll have to take off
that ridiculous mask,

1019
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,028
or l'll have to wear one, too.

1020
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:54,396
Tooley, look, please.

1021
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,600
What's the matter?

1022
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,397
Girl trouble?

1023
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,513
ls that it?

1024
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,074
Oh, l see.

1025
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:13,120
Well, that's not so serious.

1026
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:16,000
As a matter of fact,
l've been expecting it.

1027
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,080
l can't say l like it,
but l've been expecting it.

1028
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,360
Who is she?

1029
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,113
Hasn't got anything to do with her.

1030
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:26,920
This is between you and me.

1031
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,275
Then it is serious.

1032
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:31,880
Well, now.

1033
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:34,480
Tooley, you're a very stylish girl.

1034
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,755
Can't we end this stylishly?

1035
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,920
End it?

1036
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,273
Yes.

1037
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,230
Well...

1038
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:52,200
l do believe love
has found Andy Hardy.

1039
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:55,240
Let's see...a waitress?

1040
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:57,200
A salesgirl?

1041
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:01,280
No. She'd have to be rich,
wouldn't she, Paul?

1042
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,320
Someone who could help you.

1043
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:05,515
Curiously enough...

1044
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:12,280
She's a girl who can't
help anyone, not even herself.

1045
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:17,229
But l can help her, and it's
a nice feeling for a change.

1046
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,639
All right.

1047
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,910
l understand.

1048
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,000
l'll tell you what, Paul.

1049
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,680
l am a very stylish girl.

1050
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:33,240
- What are you doing?
- Writing a cheque.

1051
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,680
Don't look so bewildered.

1052
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:40,360
Surely you've noticed me
writing cheques before.

1053
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:44,760
Pay to the order
of Paul Varjak, $1 ,000.

1054
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:48,680
Take her away somewhere
for a week.

1055
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:51,080
You're entitled
to a vacation with pay.

1056
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:54,080
Simply a matter of fair
labour practice, darling.

1057
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,600
lf you were really smart,

1058
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:58,480
you'd get the boys together
and organise a union.

1059
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,960
That way you'd get
all the fringe benefits -

1060
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,000
hospitalisation, a pension plan

1061
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,000
and unemployment insurance
when you're...

1062
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
how shall l put it...

1063
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,991
between engagements?

1064
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:17,120
Thanks for making it easier for me.

1065
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:20,000
Don't be ridiculous, darling.

1066
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,720
Take the cheque.

1067
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,560
And call your girl.

1068
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:27,109
No, thanks.
l've got a cheque of my own.

1069
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,840
When you get yourself
a new writer to help,

1070
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:34,760
try and find one my size.

1071
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:38,514
That way you won't have
to even shorten the sleeves.

1072
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:42,880
- Oh! What are you doing?
- Excuse me... l'm sorry.

1073
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,000
You look just like
a girl l know named Holly.

1074
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Really!

1075
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,911
l'm sorry.

1076
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,273
Hi.

1077
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,437
What do you want?

1078
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:31,550
l want to talk to you.

1079
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,273
l'm busy.

1080
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,760
What are you doing?

1081
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,200
Reading.

1082
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:43,280
''South America:
Land of Wealth and Promise''?

1083
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,271
lt's very interesting.

1084
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,669
Let's get out of here.

1085
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,355
l said let's get out of here.
l want to talk to you.

1086
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:58,952
What's the matter with you?
What's happened?

1087
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,356
Fred, will you please
just leave me alone?

1088
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,637
l love you.

1089
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:17,680
- Where are you going?
- To the ladies' room.

1090
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:20,600
- What's the matter with you?
- Let me go.

1091
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,640
- No.
- Fred, let me go.

1092
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:23,960
Let's get something straight.

1093
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:27,960
l am not Fred,
nor am l Benny Shacklett.

1094
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:31,200
My name is Paul, Paul Varjak,
and l love you.

1095
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:36,000
- Let me go.
- No. What about South America?

1096
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,280
lf l'm marrying
a South American,

1097
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,840
l'd better find out
about the country.

1098
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:43,480
- Marry? What South American?
- Jos.

1099
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:46,400
- Who's Jos?
- Jos de Silva Pereira.

1100
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:48,400
Who's Jos de Silva Pereira?

1101
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,720
You met him -
Mag Wildwood's friend.

1102
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:54,320
The good-looking one
who came with Rusty.

1103
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,276
Well, you won't believe this -

1104
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:58,800
not only is he handsome and rich,

1105
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,840
he's absolutely cuckoo for me.

1106
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,720
- You're crazy.
- You think you own me?

1107
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:05,080
That's it exactly.

1108
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:08,360
That's what everybody always
thinks, but they're wrong.

1109
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,237
Look, l am not everybody.

1110
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,833
Or am l?

1111
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,760
ls that what you really think?

1112
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,355
That l'm no different from
all your rats and super rats?

1113
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,440
Wait a minute.

1114
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:26,317
lf that's it...

1115
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:30,280
lf that's what you really think...

1116
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:33,238
there's something l want to give you.

1117
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,400
What's that?

1118
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,470
$50 for the powder room.

1119
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:15,240
The place is in such a mess,
l couldn't face it alone.

1120
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,913
- Ah, you have a message.
- No.

1121
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:22,753
Ol.

1122
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,997
Good evening, Mr Yunioshi.

1123
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:45,640
Oh, good evening, Paul.

1124
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,789
Good evening.

1125
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,114
Good evening.

1126
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,718
Please, you must help me.

1127
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:26,237
Let me go. No!

1128
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:29,320
Oh, Fred.

1129
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,673
Fred.

1130
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,758
No! No!

1131
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:15,520
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing.

1132
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,560
There was a telegram,
and then this...

1133
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:19,600
crashing everything,
and acting crazy.

1134
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:20,920
lt's appalling.

1135
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:23,640
l can't have a public scandal.
lt's too delicate.

1136
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:25,720
My name, my position, my family.

1137
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,640
Will there be the police again?

1138
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:31,040
l don't see why. There's no law
against wrecking your apartment.

1139
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:34,635
- Where is the telegram?
- There it is.

1140
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,153
''Received notice
young Fred killed...

1141
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:50,280
''in jeep accident,
Fort Riley, Kansas.

1142
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:52,640
''Your husband and children
join in the sorrow

1143
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,119
''of our mutual loss.

1144
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,919
''Letter following. Love, Doc.''

1145
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,313
Her brother Fred.

1146
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:05,800
This brother,
was she very close to him?

1147
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,153
Yeah.

1148
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,280
What can one do?

1149
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:14,160
Try to help her.

1150
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:17,640
l tried. lt didn't do much good.

1151
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:20,520
You got a ranch
or something in Brazil?

1152
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:22,440
Yes.

1153
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,715
That's good. She'll like that.

1154
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:29,514
Well, you better get in there.

1155
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,920
- Hi.
- Hello. Got your wire.

1156
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:59,400
How did you know where to reach me?

1157
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,880
l tried everything -
called people, asked around,

1158
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:06,271
then suddenly thought of the
phone book. l'm glad you came.

1159
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:08,800
You look fine.

1160
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,160
l'm fat as a pig,
and l haven't had my hair done,

1161
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:15,120
but l'm happy, really happy -
it probably shows.

1162
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,840
You look trs distingu
yourself.

1163
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:19,520
l've got a job.
l've been writing a little.

1164
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,440
l've read three of your stories -

1165
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:25,399
two in the New Yorker and one
in that funny little magazine.

1166
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:29,520
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

1167
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,353
- l've taken up knitting.
- So l see.

1168
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:37,240
lt'll probably look very nice
once it's finished.

1169
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,040
l'm nervous about it.

1170
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:42,040
Jos brought up the blueprints
for a ranch house.

1171
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:46,520
Maybe those and my knitting
instructions got switched.

1172
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:49,353
lt's possible
l'm knitting a ranch house!

1173
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,440
Really, l can't tell you
how divinely happy l am.

1174
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,560
What is that, anyhow?

1175
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:06,480
Portuguese -
a very complicated language.

1176
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,233
4,000 irregular verbs.

1177
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,720
Very impressive.
What's it mean?

1178
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:19,473
l believe you are in league
with the butcher.

1179
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:25,509
Holly, what's this about?

1180
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:28,880
Why did you want to see me?

1181
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:32,960
Jos's in Washington tonight,
so l thought l'd ask you over.

1182
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:36,480
Well, l've said goodbye
to everyone else l care about.

1183
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,120
- You're going somewhere?
- Rio, tomorrow.

1184
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:42,560
l've got the plane ticket, and
l've even said goodbye to Sally.

1185
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:45,400
- Jos's flying with you?
- We're on separate planes.

1186
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:48,120
He thinks it's wrong
to travel together.

1187
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:52,320
His family's important, so he
worries about things like that.

1188
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:56,320
l thought l'd show off
and cook dinner for us.

1189
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:59,240
Did l tell you
how utterly happy l am?

1190
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:00,400
Yes.

1191
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,480
You are getting married, then?

1192
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:05,760
Well, he hasn't really asked me,
not in so many words.

1193
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,193
Four, you mean?

1194
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:11,520
Well, that's how many
words it takes.

1195
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,158
''Will you marry me?''

1196
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:16,640
We'll get married, all right.

1197
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:18,800
ln church and with his family there,

1198
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:22,588
and that's why he's waiting
till we get to Rio...probably.

1199
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:28,040
Do you think it's trying
to tell us something?

1200
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:31,880
l hope you like chicken
and rice with chocolate sauce.

1201
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,880
lt's an lndian classic, dear.

1202
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,836
Three months ago,
l couldn't scramble eggs.

1203
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:42,360
Are you all right?

1204
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:45,280
Golly, darling. l did so want
to impress you.

1205
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:48,920
Look, l'm not much
for chicken with sauce, anyway.

1206
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:53,120
Why don't we go out somewhere
for a farewell dinner?

1207
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,715
That would be fun,
as long as l can go like this.

1208
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,600
Years from now,

1209
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:06,960
years and years,

1210
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,680
l'll be back...

1211
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:11,035
me and my nine Brazilian brats.

1212
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,640
They'll be dark like Jos, of course,

1213
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:17,438
but they'll have bright green,
beautiful eyes.

1214
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,720
l'll bring them back, all right,

1215
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:23,358
because they must see this.

1216
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:26,040
Oh, l love New York.

1217
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:29,635
Then why are you leaving?
What's in it for you, anyway?

1218
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:34,080
l know what you're thinking.
l don't blame you.

1219
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,760
l've always thrown out
such a jazzy line,

1220
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:41,960
but except for Doc and yourself,
Jos's my first non-rat romance.

1221
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:44,840
Not that he's my idea
of the absolute finito.

1222
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:49,080
He's too prim and cautious
to be my absolute ideal.

1223
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:52,880
lf l could choose from anybody,
l wouldn't pick Jos.

1224
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:55,600
Nero, maybe, or Albert Schweitzer.

1225
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,272
Or Leonard Bernstein.

1226
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,000
But l am mad about Jos.

1227
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,753
l'd give up smoking if he asked me.

1228
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,080
Come on, darling, let's eat.

1229
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:09,559
lt's getting late.

1230
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:14,356
l'm leaving tomorrow
and l haven't begun to pack.

1231
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:37,600
Didn't want Jos to think
l'm a girl who loses her key,

1232
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,880
so l had 26 of them made.

1233
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,840
Wait. l got a better idea.

1234
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,273
Kind of a farewell gesture.

1235
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:46,560
Somebody must have tripped the lock.

1236
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:49,280
Ah, crafty devil, that Yunioshi.

1237
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,760
Wake up, wake up!
The British are coming!

1238
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:53,480
Or, in this case, the Brazilians.

1239
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:54,800
Exactly.

1240
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,920
l've still got to clean up that rice.

1241
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:59,239
Hey, you know...

1242
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:07,440
There she are who did it!
The wanted woman! There!

1243
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,320
Groenburger. Narcotics squad.

1244
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:10,520
What do you mean?

1245
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:11,600
What's going on?

1246
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:14,320
- Why don't you ask your boss?
- What boss?

1247
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:16,440
Sally Tomato. Ask him. Come on.

1248
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:19,796
Look around for narcotic!
They got plenty in there.

1249
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:40,280
- What's your name?
- Varjak.

1250
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:42,120
Hold it down over there!

1251
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:46,400
Paul Varjak. V-A-R-J-A-K. Get lost!

1252
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:47,960
Get out!

1253
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:51,589
l'm a writer. W-R-l-T-E-R.

1254
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:56,960
l can't answer all your questions.

1255
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:00,430
One at a time. One, please. Good.

1256
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:04,280
l can't answer all your questions.

1257
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:05,600
One at a time.

1258
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,318
Knock it off!

1259
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:11,000
Now, why don't you start?

1260
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,280
Did you carry messages in code?

1261
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:14,800
Of course not.

1262
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:17,120
l'd just give Mr O'Shaughnessy
the weather report.

1263
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:19,960
Simply do not ask me
what this is all about.

1264
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:23,920
- You did visit Tomato?
- Every week. What's wrong?

1265
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,120
Tomato's part
of the narcotics syndicate.

1266
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:28,160
He never mentioned narcotics.

1267
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,560
These wretched people
keep persecuting him.

1268
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:34,360
He's a deeply sensitive person,
a darling old man.

1269
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:36,560
- Then you're innocent.
- Of course.

1270
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:42,080
What are you going to do
about it? Who's your lawyer?

1271
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:44,469
l don't know.
Mr O'Shaughnessy, l guess.

1272
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,391
Mr O'Shaughnessy!

1273
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:49,520
Hey! Get out of here!

1274
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:52,034
All right, come on! OK, move.

1275
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:55,440
Shut up!

1276
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:56,998
Get in there!

1277
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:20,040
- Yeah.
- Mr Paul Varjak?

1278
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:21,120
Yeah.

1279
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:23,280
Ready with Mr Berman
in Hollywood.

1280
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:26,556
Kindly deposit $3
for the first 3 minutes.

1281
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:38,000
Hello? Hello?

1282
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,240
OJ Berman here. Who's calling?

1283
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:45,520
- This is Paul Varjak.
- Nice to talk to you, kid.

1284
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:48,840
Varjak. V-A-R-J-A-K.

1285
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:51,720
l'm a friend of Holly's.
We met at a party.

1286
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:55,920
- Who?
- Paul. Paul Varjak.

1287
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:57,800
V-A-R...

1288
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:00,760
Mr Berman, this is Fred.

1289
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:02,800
Oh, Fred, baby, huh?

1290
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,240
You're calling about the kid, huh?

1291
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:08,360
Everything's under control.
You can just relax.

1292
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:12,320
l spoke to my lawyer in New York.

1293
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:16,280
l told him to take care of it,
but keep my name anonymous.

1294
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:20,400
- What?
- l want no part of it. Hear me?

1295
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,720
You sound like you're in a tunnel.

1296
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:25,160
lt's this executive phone l have.

1297
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:28,040
- What?
- Executive phone!

1298
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:30,440
They only got her on 1 0,000 bail.

1299
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:32,920
My lawyer can get her out at 1 0am.

1300
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:34,840
l tell you what you do.

1301
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:37,680
You bust into that dump she lives in,

1302
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:39,040
collect all her junk,

1303
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:44,560
go get her, take her to a hotel
under a phoney name.

1304
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:47,080
Keep her away from the reporters.

1305
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:48,480
Will you do that?

1306
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:49,840
Sure, Mr Berman.

1307
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,120
l can't tell you
how much l appreciate...

1308
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:55,829
Forget it.
l mean, l owe her something.

1309
01:38:56,920 --> 01:39:01,080
Not that l owe her anything,
if you get right down to it,

1310
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:03,799
but...she's a crazy.

1311
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,351
She's a phoney.

1312
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:11,080
But she's a real phoney.

1313
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:13,040
Know what l mean, kid?

1314
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,400
Yeah, l know what you mean.

1315
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:17,640
Thanks, Mr Berman. Thanks a lot.

1316
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:19,392
Right!

1317
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:27,875
Why don't you behave?

1318
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,949
Quel night.

1319
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:56,880
l did a little housebreaking
while you were away.

1320
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,314
Clayton Hotel, driver.
84th and Madison.

1321
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:04,920
OJ thinks you should
stay out of sight for a while.

1322
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:07,400
l got your stuff here, including cat.

1323
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:09,720
Hope he's all right.

1324
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,560
Hello, cat...

1325
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:13,551
Poor no-name slob.

1326
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:18,360
Listen, darling,
did you find that plane ticket?

1327
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:21,960
- Here. We can cash it in.
- Are you kidding?

1328
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:25,640
- What time is it?
- A little after 1 0.

1329
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:27,000
ldlewild Airport, driver.

1330
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,480
- Never mind. You can't do that.
- Why not?

1331
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:32,720
You don't understand.
You're under indictment.

1332
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:36,040
You jump bail,
they'll throw away the key.

1333
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:38,960
Don't be ridiculous.
Soon l'll be married

1334
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,960
to the future president of Brazil.

1335
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:43,793
That'll give me diplomatic
immunity or something.

1336
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:47,160
l wouldn't bet on it.

1337
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:50,080
What is it, darling?

1338
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:53,356
l have a message for you.

1339
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,360
Oh, yes, l see.

1340
01:40:56,360 --> 01:41:01,480
Did he bring it in person,
or was it shoved under the door?

1341
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:03,038
A cousin.

1342
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,280
Hand me my purse, will you, darling?

1343
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,760
A girl can't read
that sort of thing...

1344
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,079
without her lipstick.

1345
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:14,960
You read it to me, darling.

1346
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:17,440
l don't think l can quite...bear...

1347
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,635
Are you sure you want me to?

1348
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,280
''My dearest little girl,

1349
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:31,200
''l have loved you
knowing you were not as others,

1350
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:33,240
''but conceive of my despair

1351
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:36,840
''upon discovering in such
a brutal and public style

1352
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:40,440
''how very different you are
from the manner of woman

1353
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:43,720
''a man of my position
could hope to make his wife.

1354
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:47,200
''l grieve for the disgrace
of your present circumstances,

1355
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:50,240
''and l do not find it in my heart

1356
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:52,000
''to add my condemn...

1357
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,840
''to the condemn that surrounds you.

1358
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:59,640
''so l hope you find it
in your heart not to condemn me.

1359
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:02,520
''l have my family
to protect, and my name.

1360
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:06,600
''l am a coward where
these institutions enter.

1361
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:08,880
''Forget me, beautiful child,

1362
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:11,160
''and may God be with you.

1363
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:12,559
''Jos.''

1364
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:16,313
Well...

1365
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:20,160
Well, at least he's honest.

1366
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:22,080
lt's kind of touching.

1367
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,913
Touching! That square-ball jazz.

1368
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,400
He says he's a coward.

1369
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,720
All right! So he's not a regular rat

1370
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:32,240
or even a super rat.

1371
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:35,120
He's just a scared little mouse,
that's all.

1372
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:39,238
But, oh, golly... Gee, damn!

1373
01:42:44,120 --> 01:42:49,240
Well, so much for South America.

1374
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:52,560
You're not cut out
for queen of the Pampas, anyway.

1375
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:55,520
- Clayton Hotel.
- ldlewild.

1376
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:56,880
What?

1377
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:00,440
The plane leaves at 1 2.
On it l plan to be.

1378
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:03,320
- Holly, you can't.
- Et pourquoi pas?

1379
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:05,800
l'm not hotfooting it
after Jos,

1380
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:08,080
if that's what you think. Oh, no.

1381
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,960
As far as l'm concerned, he's
the future president of nowhere.

1382
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:13,720
Only why waste a plane ticket?

1383
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:16,518
Besides, l've never been to Brazil.

1384
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:20,400
Please, darling, don't sit there
looking at me like that.

1385
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:23,278
l'm going and that's that.

1386
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:28,600
All they want are my services
as a witness against Sally.

1387
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,720
Nobody has any intention
of prosecuting me.

1388
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:35,920
To begin with, they don't have
a ghost of a chance.

1389
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,840
This town's finished for me...

1390
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,760
at least for a while.

1391
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:41,640
There are certain shades of limelight

1392
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:44,200
that can wreck a girl's complexion.

1393
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:47,431
They'll have the rope up
at every saloon in town.

1394
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:51,280
l'll tell you what.
When you get back to town,

1395
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:54,360
call the New York Times
or whoever you call.

1396
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:59,957
Mail me a list of the 50 richest
men in Brazil. The 50 richest!

1397
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:02,040
Holly.

1398
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:03,960
l won't let you do this.

1399
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:06,840
- You won't?
- Holly, l'm in love with you.

1400
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:11,040
- So what?
- So what? So plenty!

1401
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:13,760
l love you. You belong to me.

1402
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,200
No. People don't belong to people.

1403
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:17,520
Of course they do.

1404
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:21,200
- Nobody's putting me in a cage.
- l want to love you.

1405
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:22,600
lt's the same thing.

1406
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:24,640
No, it's not! Holly!

1407
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:26,960
l'm not Holly.
l'm not Lula Mae, either.

1408
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:30,600
l don't know who l am!
l'm like cat, a no-name slob.

1409
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:32,440
We belong to nobody.

1410
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:34,635
We don't even belong to each other.

1411
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:36,635
Stop the cab.

1412
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:43,600
What do you think?

1413
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,560
This ought to be the right place

1414
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:49,640
for a tough guy like you -
garbage cans, rats galore.

1415
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:53,160
Scram! l said take off! Beat it!

1416
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:54,593
Let's go.

1417
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,832
Driver...

1418
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:11,751
Pull over here.

1419
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:22,760
You know what's wrong with you,
Miss Whoever-You-Are?

1420
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:24,280
You're chicken.

1421
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:25,800
You've got no guts.

1422
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:28,840
You're afraid to say,
''OK, life's a fact.''

1423
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:30,440
People do fall in love.

1424
01:45:30,440 --> 01:45:32,120
People do belong to each other,

1425
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:35,920
because that's the only chance
anybody's got for happiness.

1426
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:39,280
You call yourself a free spirit,
a wild thing.

1427
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:42,240
You're terrified somebody's
going to stick you in a cage.

1428
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:44,440
Well, baby,
you're already in that cage.

1429
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:45,760
You built it yourself.

1430
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:49,160
And it's not bounded
by Tulip, Texas, or Somaliland.

1431
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:50,200
lt's wherever you go.

1432
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:52,440
Because no matter where you run,

1433
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:55,113
you end up running into yourself.

1434
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:05,640
Here. l've been carrying
this thing around for months.

1435
01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:07,517
l don't want it any more.

1436
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:59,795
Here, cat!

1437
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:01,599
Cat!

1438
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:11,512
Where's the cat?

1439
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:14,591
l don't know.

1440
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:51,440
Two drifters

1441
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:55,040
Off to see the world

1442
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:59,000
There's such a lot of world

1443
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:03,680
To see

1444
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:07,480
We're after

1445
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:10,720
The same

1446
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:15,600
Rainbow's end

1447
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:19,040
Waitin' 'round the bend

1448
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:22,840
My huckleberry friend

1449
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:29,440
Moon River

1450
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:31,192
And me

1451
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:38,118
