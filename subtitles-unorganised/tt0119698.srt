Studio Ghibli presents
A FILM BY MIYAZAKI HAYAO

2
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:35,150
In ancient times the land
lay covered in forest...

3
00:00:35,224 --> 00:00:41,629
...where from ages long past
dwelt the spirits of the gods.

4
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:29,353
PRINCESS MONONOKE

5
00:01:43,306 --> 00:01:44,295
Yakul!

6
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,769
Ashitaka!

7
00:01:52,615 --> 00:01:55,584
Oracle says to get back to the village.

8
00:01:55,652 --> 00:01:57,517
The Old Man, too.

9
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,214
- He says something's wrong.
- No birds.

10
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,279
No animals...

11
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:06,055
I'll go to him. You get back home.

12
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,959
Something's coming!

13
00:02:52,775 --> 00:02:54,174
What is it?

14
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:56,677
It's not a person...

15
00:02:56,746 --> 00:02:59,977
Oracle's called everyone in.

16
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:02,116
There!

17
00:03:31,214 --> 00:03:33,444
A demon god!

18
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,669
Yakul, run!

19
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:23,992
It'll attack the village!

20
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,795
Ashitaka!

21
00:04:25,902 --> 00:04:29,338
Don't touch it!
Its curse will be on you!

22
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:31,570
Yakul!

23
00:04:54,897 --> 00:04:56,888
Quiet your rage, I beg you!

24
00:04:56,999 --> 00:05:01,766
O forest god who cannot be
without name, why do you rampage so?

25
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:20,755
- A monster!
- Run!

26
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:25,293
Stop! Do not destroy our village!

27
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:27,294
Stop! Still your rage!

28
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:32,994
Get up!

29
00:06:28,357 --> 00:06:30,985
- It's down!
- Ashitaka!

30
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,220
Bring Oracle!

31
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:33,489
Watch the fire!

32
00:06:35,164 --> 00:06:36,290
Ashitaka!

33
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:42,403
Don't touch it! It's no ordinary wound!

34
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:45,463
He's hurt! Where's Oracle?!

35
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:48,237
All of you, stay back!

36
00:06:48,744 --> 00:06:49,870
Oracle!

37
00:06:49,946 --> 00:06:53,347
Pour this water over it...slowly.

38
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,788
O raging god unknown to us...

39
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:13,700
...l bow before you.

40
00:07:14,804 --> 00:07:19,366
Where you have fallen we will
raise a mound and perform rites.

41
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:22,206
Bear us no hate, and be at peace.

42
00:07:23,846 --> 00:07:27,111
You loathsome rabble!

43
00:07:28,117 --> 00:07:32,053
You shall know my hatred
and my grief!.

44
00:08:11,227 --> 00:08:14,628
This is very, very bad.

45
00:08:14,697 --> 00:08:18,633
The boar-spirit came from
far to the west.

46
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:22,797
A poison within him goaded him on,
rotting his flesh...

47
00:08:22,872 --> 00:08:28,868
...drawing evil as he ran,
making a monster of him.

48
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:31,162
Prince Ashitaka...

49
00:08:32,564 --> 00:08:34,896
Show your right arm.

50
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:44,397
Oracle!

51
00:08:45,743 --> 00:08:50,703
Prince Ashitaka, are you steeled
to gaze upon your fate?

52
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:54,444
Yes. I was resolved
when I let my arrow fly.

53
00:08:56,754 --> 00:09:00,986
The scar will seep into your bones
and you will die.

54
00:09:05,763 --> 00:09:07,958
Can nothing be done?!

55
00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:11,399
He was defending the girls,
and the village!

56
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:13,664
Can we but sit and wait?

57
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:16,999
You cannot change your fate.

58
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:21,512
You can, though, rise to meet it.

59
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:23,069
Look.

60
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,075
This was inside the boar's body.

61
00:09:28,753 --> 00:09:34,191
He was in agony. It shattered
his bones, tore at his entrails...

62
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:38,093
What else could
have made him that way?

63
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:43,062
Calamity has befallen
the land of the west.

64
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:47,764
Journey there, and see
with eyes unclouded.

65
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:52,173
There might be a way
to lift the curse.

66
00:09:54,345 --> 00:10:01,148
More than 500 years have gone since
the Mikado drove us into this land.

67
00:10:01,219 --> 00:10:04,985
Now we hear how his power fades...

68
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:08,822
...and the fangs of his Shoguns
are broken.

69
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:13,557
But the blood of our tribe
likewise grows thin.

70
00:10:14,098 --> 00:10:19,195
And now, bitter fate...
the youth who was one day to lead us...

71
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,467
...must journey far to the west.

72
00:10:38,256 --> 00:10:42,716
The law forbids that we watch
as you go. Farewell.

73
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,882
Brother!

74
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,119
Kaya, you can't be here!

75
00:11:16,794 --> 00:11:20,628
I don't care. Remember me by this.

76
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,370
But it's your jeweled dagger!

77
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:30,471
Keep it with you to guard you.

78
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:35,103
I'll think of you...
be sure of that.

79
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:38,444
As will l, Kaya.

80
00:13:07,972 --> 00:13:09,234
Fighting?

81
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:18,973
Move up!

82
00:13:22,153 --> 00:13:23,780
A warrior!

83
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:25,879
His head is mine!

84
00:13:36,501 --> 00:13:37,695
Stop!

85
00:13:45,943 --> 00:13:47,604
My arm!

86
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:51,247
Don't let him get away!

87
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:53,816
Let me pass!

88
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,256
A demon!

89
00:14:23,548 --> 00:14:25,448
The scar's growing...

90
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:39,524
This gruel tastes like hot water!

91
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:45,692
There he is!

92
00:14:52,176 --> 00:14:53,438
Will this do?

93
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:55,638
This isn't money!

94
00:14:56,314 --> 00:14:58,009
Give back my rice!

95
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,074
Could I see that, please?

96
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:03,315
Hm?!

97
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:07,517
Woman, this is pure gold!

98
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:11,987
Is it coins you want? I'll pay you.

99
00:15:12,063 --> 00:15:13,291
Give me this.

100
00:15:13,965 --> 00:15:17,628
Is there a money-changer here?

101
00:15:17,702 --> 00:15:19,829
No?

102
00:15:20,237 --> 00:15:25,732
I'm just a simple priest, but I'd say
this is worth three sacks of rice!

103
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,038
Wait, young sir!

104
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:28,806
That's mine! Give it back!

105
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,172
Hey! Don't be in such a rush!

106
00:15:33,884 --> 00:15:39,584
No need to thank me.
It's I who should thank you.

107
00:15:39,657 --> 00:15:43,787
I saw what you did before
against those samurai.

108
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:48,529
You fight like one possessed!

109
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:55,972
Ah, you see those men, too?
Keep your gold hidden, my lad.

110
00:15:56,674 --> 00:15:59,788
Hearts have grown hard
throughout the land.

111
00:16:00,656 --> 00:16:04,217
They'll rob you in your sleep.
Shall we run?

112
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:17,968
So the boar became a monster...

113
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,703
I tracked it back to where
the samurai attacked the village, but...

114
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:25,269
You lost it.

115
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:27,008
See over there?

116
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:33,517
When I was last this way,
there was a fine village here.

117
00:16:33,622 --> 00:16:37,991
There was a flood, maybe,
or a landslide. I'm sure many died.

118
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:43,358
The land teems with the twittering
of bitter ghosts...

119
00:16:43,432 --> 00:16:47,869
...dead from war, sick or starved
and fallen where they stood...

120
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:52,134
A curse, you say?
This world is a curse.

121
00:16:54,676 --> 00:16:56,303
Ah, this is good!

122
00:16:58,046 --> 00:17:01,982
I shouldn't have gotten into
that fight. I killed two men.

123
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,780
You saved me that task.

124
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:07,754
Give me your bowl.

125
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:09,120
We all die.

126
00:17:09,758 --> 00:17:11,885
Some now, some later.

127
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,622
Hm, an elegant bowl...

128
00:17:14,696 --> 00:17:19,133
You remind me of the old tales...

129
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:22,733
A brave people, far to the east...

130
00:17:22,804 --> 00:17:26,365
...who used stone arrowheads
and rode red elk...the Emishi.

131
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:36,314
First, though,
avoid the jaws of death.

132
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:39,582
Or so my old teacher used to say.

133
00:17:39,655 --> 00:17:42,089
Eat, my lad. It's your rice!

134
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:46,261
Would you know what this is?

135
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:51,755
No.

136
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:57,738
It was in the body of the giant boar.
It's what killed him.

137
00:18:07,683 --> 00:18:10,880
Far to the west...

138
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:15,014
...deep in the mountains,
is the forest of the Deer God.

139
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,717
There no man may tread.

140
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:18,316
The forest of the Deer God?

141
00:18:18,393 --> 00:18:23,387
They say the beasts there are giants,
as they were in ages past.

142
00:18:57,466 --> 00:18:59,331
I knew he'd go...

143
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:34,795
It's not far now!
Stay on your guard!

144
00:19:35,937 --> 00:19:37,336
Here they come!

145
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:38,667
The wolves!

146
00:19:46,314 --> 00:19:49,772
Calm the oxen! Don't rush!
Form your ranks!

147
00:19:49,885 --> 00:19:51,785
Keep your powder dry!

148
00:19:52,454 --> 00:19:54,285
Let them come in range!

149
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,025
Number 1 , fire!

150
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,711
Number 2, fire!

151
00:20:29,925 --> 00:20:32,621
They weren't much, as monsters go.

152
00:20:32,694 --> 00:20:35,822
Those were just the pups.
Where's the mother?

153
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:43,997
It's Moro!

154
00:20:50,345 --> 00:20:51,903
Come on!

155
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:07,017
Got her!

156
00:21:07,095 --> 00:21:10,428
She's a god.
She won't die from that.

157
00:21:18,373 --> 00:21:20,204
She did some damage...

158
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:21,708
Move them out.

159
00:21:21,776 --> 00:21:23,573
What about the ones who fell?

160
00:21:23,645 --> 00:21:25,408
Form up and move out!

161
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,897
He's breathing!

162
00:21:47,802 --> 00:21:49,133
Hang on!

163
00:22:51,132 --> 00:22:55,501
I am Ashitaka! I have come
from far to the east!

164
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:59,199
Are you ancient gods
of the forest of the Deer God?

165
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,782
Leave!

166
00:23:37,078 --> 00:23:39,740
A kodama? Are they here, too?

167
00:23:42,017 --> 00:23:44,611
You're hurt. Keep still.

168
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:53,951
They won't harm you.
They're a sign the woods are healthy.

169
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:56,122
They'll bring their lord!

170
00:23:56,197 --> 00:23:58,512
Who? The wolf?

171
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:02,548
No, a huge monster!

172
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:06,418
It's gone!

173
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:15,990
Yakul's not afraid.
There's no danger here.

174
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:21,294
We beg passage
through your woods.

175
00:24:33,147 --> 00:24:34,944
Let's go back! Please!

176
00:24:35,816 --> 00:24:40,014
There's a trail across the river.
We'll never get through these woods!

177
00:24:40,554 --> 00:24:42,886
The current's too strong.

178
00:24:42,957 --> 00:24:46,518
And if we don't get this man back soon,
it'll be too late.

179
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:55,335
Are you showing us the way,
or getting us lost?

180
00:25:09,984 --> 00:25:14,045
Sir! These things
aren't helping us get home.

181
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:15,918
There's more and more of them!

182
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:39,777
This is your mother? A fine tree!

183
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:25,324
That girl and the wolves...
so this is where they live...

184
00:26:25,926 --> 00:26:30,761
We're getting in deeper, sir.
This way leads into the other world.

185
00:26:30,831 --> 00:26:32,856
Yes, let's take a rest.

186
00:26:44,712 --> 00:26:45,940
Tracks...

187
00:26:52,086 --> 00:26:56,284
Three toes...and still fresh.

188
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,371
Sir! What's wrong?

189
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:28,708
Are you all right, sir?
You're awfully pale...

190
00:28:29,783 --> 00:28:31,683
I told you!

191
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,016
Did you see something?

192
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,577
Forget it.

193
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,654
Hang on a little longer.

194
00:28:39,726 --> 00:28:41,489
I'm sorry.

195
00:28:47,868 --> 00:28:49,665
It's gone...

196
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:55,534
Why does he suddenly feel so light?

197
00:28:55,642 --> 00:28:58,543
Hey! It doesn't hurt!

198
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,415
I'm cured!...ow! No, it's broken.

199
00:29:08,055 --> 00:29:12,389
Sir! You're exactly right!
We're back at the ironworks!

200
00:29:44,591 --> 00:29:45,922
It's a fort!

201
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,154
Lady Eboshi's ironworks.

202
00:29:48,228 --> 00:29:51,220
They melt iron sand into iron.

203
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:52,996
Hey!

204
00:29:54,034 --> 00:29:56,025
Hey!

205
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,105
- Someone's coming from the woods!
- The wolf princess?

206
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:04,377
It's me! Koroku the ox-driver!

207
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:11,450
It's true! He's crossing the lake!

208
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:17,183
What's all this noise?!
Be quiet when I'm writing!

209
00:30:17,257 --> 00:30:20,021
Koruku's come back from the dead!

210
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:21,151
What?!

211
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,037
You're not a ghost.

212
00:30:35,108 --> 00:30:38,100
- Where are the others?
- Four of you fell...

213
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:40,169
It's just us left.

214
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:45,749
It's never the guards that die.

215
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:47,150
Move!

216
00:30:47,754 --> 00:30:51,212
Who's the man in the hood, sir?

217
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:52,815
An outsider...

218
00:30:54,194 --> 00:31:00,099
Listen, Riflemen...this gentleman
carried your man all the way here.

219
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:01,896
Thank him.

220
00:31:02,336 --> 00:31:05,794
Ow! Don't grab me there!

221
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,841
Hey, you! Wait!

222
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:24,454
First, my thanks
for bringing back our men.

223
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:27,049
But something bothers me...

224
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:30,722
You got here in less than
half the time we did...

225
00:31:30,797 --> 00:31:34,028
...through the Deer God's forest,
carrying two...

226
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,433
Koroku! You're alive!

227
00:31:36,503 --> 00:31:38,095
Toki!

228
00:31:41,842 --> 00:31:45,642
Look at that leg! How are you
going to drive oxen now?!

229
00:31:45,712 --> 00:31:46,940
But...but...

230
00:31:47,014 --> 00:31:50,882
Scaring me half to death!
The wolf-god should've eaten you!

231
00:31:50,984 --> 00:31:53,248
Then I could find a better husband!

232
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,118
Toki! They're all listening!

233
00:31:56,223 --> 00:31:59,090
Toki, save your love-talk for later.

234
00:32:00,227 --> 00:32:02,654
And you! Leaving them there to die!

235
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:06,485
Some escort you are!
You don't do any real work here.

236
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,549
At least act when there's danger!

237
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:10,595
What could I do?

238
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:14,098
Thank you. My husband's an idiot,
but I'm glad he's safe.

239
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,261
Good. I was afraid maybe
I'd done something wrong.

240
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:26,468
You look very handsome.
Show us your face.

241
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:27,739
Gonza...

242
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:32,975
I would like to thank the traveler.
Bring him to me later.

243
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,040
Koroku...

244
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:38,580
It's good you're back. I apologize.

245
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:44,027
Don't say that, Milady. He'll just
take advantage of you.

246
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:49,029
Forgive me, Toki. I shouldn't
have let it happen.

247
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:52,934
If you hadn't been there, Milady...

248
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:55,029
...the wolves would've got them all.

249
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:00,775
Go and rest, Traveler.

250
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,847
Hey! You are handsome!

251
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:38,780
We had to fight off Moro
to bring this rice, you know.

252
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,340
Dish it out!

253
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,649
Where?

254
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,279
Him?

255
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,722
Toki was right!

256
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:49,761
- He is handsome!
- A bit young...

257
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,523
That never stopped you before!

258
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,496
Quiet out there! We lost two men!

259
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,762
There's lots of handsome men here!

260
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,894
Bunch of cowherds!

261
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:04,806
Come over to our place, Traveler!
Forget this stinking barn!

262
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:09,506
Watch your mouth! We risked our lives
to bring the rice you're eating.

263
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:12,845
And who made the iron
that bought that rice?

264
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:15,284
We work those bellows
all night long!

265
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:19,282
I would like to see where you work,
if you don't mind...

266
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,380
Really?

267
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,653
We'll have to work in make-up!

268
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,388
Rouge, too?

269
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,365
Don't forget! We'll be waiting!

270
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,635
Don't mind them, sir.

271
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,434
Lady Eboshi spoils them.

272
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:38,635
A good town has happy women.

273
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:42,439
But women working the bellows
in an ironworks?

274
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:45,381
Their presence defiles the iron.

275
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:50,082
Milady buys up the contract
of every brothel girl she finds!

276
00:34:50,155 --> 00:34:52,282
She's kind, that's all.

277
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:54,325
There's rice on your face, old man.

278
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:58,522
But she's not afraid
of ancient laws, or of curses.

279
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,532
Or of gods, either.

280
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,433
You should've seen her with Nago!

281
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:05,594
'Nago'?

282
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,401
A huge boar-god. He ruled
the forest around here.

283
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,476
We couldn't get near the mountains.

284
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:15,775
All we could do was
sit here and look up at them.

285
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:19,650
The sand down below was worked out.

286
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:24,982
Lots of people had their eye on
this place. The boars got them all.

287
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,924
To get sand, we have to
clear the trees.

288
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,951
Nago got mad.

289
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,376
There they go again!

290
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,413
Then Lady Eboshi came along
with her guns.

291
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,510
Sir? What's wrong?

292
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:29,986
Does your arm hurt?

293
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:33,047
I was just thinking about that boar...

294
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,758
He must have died full of hate.

295
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:45,835
Sorry to keep you waiting...

296
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:47,496
That's good iron.

297
00:36:47,973 --> 00:36:50,635
We were late with
tomorrow's shipment.

298
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:55,875
Let's have a rest. Tell the others.

299
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,844
Some think you're spying
for the samurai, or the wolf princess.

300
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:05,045
Many have their eyes on our iron.

301
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:07,091
May I ask why you're here?

302
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,465
I'm sure you know this.

303
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:21,428
It shattered the bones of a giant boar,
rotted his flesh and made him a monster.

304
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:26,975
When I tried to stop him, I was left
with this scar: a curse unto death.

305
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:30,946
Where is your land?
I've never seen an elk like yours.

306
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:35,286
Between north and east.
That's all I will say.

307
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:39,346
Answer when you're asked
or I'll cut you in two!

308
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:42,292
What do you plan to do?

309
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:46,196
See with eyes unclouded.

310
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:49,023
'Eyes unclouded'?

311
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,237
I see.

312
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,740
Come. I'll show you my secret.

313
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:59,037
Milady!

314
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,010
Take over, Gonza.

315
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,903
My garden, where none dare come.

316
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,842
Come, if you wish
to know my secret.

317
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:17,487
Good evening.

318
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:27,364
We've just finished.

319
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,198
It's still heavy.

320
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:32,862
You hold it so lightly...

321
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:35,872
Too light and it'll fall apart.

322
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:40,775
They aren't for me.
They're for the other women here.

323
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,210
Won't that be a sight!

324
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:47,080
This is the new gun
these people have contrived.

325
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:49,211
The Chinese ones are too heavy.

326
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:53,220
It will kill monsters
and pierce samurai armor.

327
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:57,589
Beware! Lady Eboshi
wants to rule the world!

328
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,795
I'm sorry to rush you.
I'll send sake later.

329
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,376
Won't that be nice!

330
00:40:05,211 --> 00:40:09,079
You stole the boar's woods
and made a monster of him.

331
00:40:09,149 --> 00:40:12,312
Now will you breed new hatreds
with those guns?

332
00:40:13,386 --> 00:40:15,479
I regret that you suffer.

333
00:40:15,555 --> 00:40:18,388
I fired that shot.

334
00:40:18,858 --> 00:40:22,316
It is me that brainless pig
should have cursed.

335
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,047
Would your right hand like to kill me?

336
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:46,116
To lift the curse, my left would, too.

337
00:40:46,186 --> 00:40:48,620
But I fear it would not stop there.

338
00:40:49,222 --> 00:40:52,191
Must it kill us all to be at peace?

339
00:40:52,258 --> 00:40:56,592
Milady...Osa speaks.

340
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:01,797
Milady...do not scorn
the young man's strength.

341
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:06,771
Young man, I too am cursed.

342
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,367
I know well your rage
and your grief.

343
00:41:10,477 --> 00:41:15,380
I know this, but I beg you
not to kill this lady.

344
00:41:15,448 --> 00:41:21,409
She is the only one
who looked upon us as human.

345
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,983
Without fear of our disease...

346
00:41:25,058 --> 00:41:29,620
...she washed our rotting flesh,
bandaged us...

347
00:41:32,565 --> 00:41:33,691
Osa...

348
00:41:33,766 --> 00:41:37,395
Life is suffering. It is hard.

349
00:41:37,504 --> 00:41:42,203
The world is cursed, people are cursed,
but still we wish to live...

350
00:41:42,275 --> 00:41:44,903
Forgive my foolish raving...

351
00:42:04,497 --> 00:42:06,158
They're back.

352
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:11,600
At night they come to plant trees
and take back the mountain.

353
00:42:11,704 --> 00:42:15,071
Ashitaka, will you stay here
and work with me?

354
00:42:16,009 --> 00:42:18,443
Do you want even
the Deer God's woods?

355
00:42:18,545 --> 00:42:23,005
Without the ancient gods,
the wild ones are mere beasts.

356
00:42:23,516 --> 00:42:28,681
With the forest gone and the wolves
with it, this will be a land of riches.

357
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:30,484
That girl will be human.

358
00:42:31,691 --> 00:42:32,680
Who?

359
00:42:33,293 --> 00:42:36,694
Mononoke, the wild girl whose soul
the wolves stole.

360
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:39,061
She lives to kill me.

361
00:42:44,637 --> 00:42:48,403
It is said the blood of the Deer God
will cure disease.

362
00:42:48,474 --> 00:42:53,912
It could cure these people,
and perhaps even lift your curse.

363
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,848
Milady...what do you think?

364
00:42:58,351 --> 00:43:01,616
Very well made. Perfect
for ruling the world.

365
00:43:01,688 --> 00:43:04,122
But it's still a bit heavy.

366
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,248
Oh, dear!

367
00:43:32,185 --> 00:43:34,278
Look who's here!

368
00:43:34,787 --> 00:43:36,755
Let me work the bellows.

369
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:38,620
Huh? Hey, wait!

370
00:43:41,527 --> 00:43:43,017
May I try?

371
00:43:44,364 --> 00:43:46,525
If he insists...

372
00:43:58,911 --> 00:44:01,106
You really came!

373
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,114
What did I tell you?

374
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,276
Look, she's fixing her kimono!

375
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,515
You'll never keep that pace.

376
00:44:10,423 --> 00:44:11,890
It's hard work.

377
00:44:11,991 --> 00:44:14,653
Yep. We work four days' straight.

378
00:44:15,461 --> 00:44:17,258
Is life hard here?

379
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:21,993
Yeah, but it's better than
life in the towns.

380
00:44:22,068 --> 00:44:25,765
We eat our fill,
and the men know their place.

381
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:27,670
I see...

382
00:45:13,228 --> 00:45:15,696
- You go tomorrow?
- Stay longer!

383
00:45:15,764 --> 00:45:17,356
Work here!

384
00:45:17,433 --> 00:45:20,596
Thank you, but there is someone
I must meet.

385
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:28,302
She's here!

386
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:35,673
The wolf princess!

387
00:46:13,555 --> 00:46:14,544
It's her!

388
00:46:15,524 --> 00:46:17,048
Stop!

389
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:18,992
I don't want to fight you!

390
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,190
She's after Milady!

391
00:46:36,945 --> 00:46:41,177
Build up the fires! Riflemen to
the stockade! Keep her inside!

392
00:46:41,283 --> 00:46:44,480
Stay at your posts!

393
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:47,385
She's up on the roof!.

394
00:46:47,456 --> 00:46:50,289
Don't get excited! Keep working!

395
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:51,986
The fire mustn't go out!

396
00:46:53,095 --> 00:46:56,861
- Is she alone?
- Yes. We have her cornered.

397
00:46:56,932 --> 00:46:59,162
It's Milady she came for.

398
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:01,566
Oh well...come on.

399
00:47:10,379 --> 00:47:14,076
Can you hear me, Princess Mononoke?
I'm here.

400
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:17,714
If you would avenge your tribe...

401
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:22,784
...here are some who seek
vengeance for husbands...

402
00:47:22,858 --> 00:47:24,951
...killed by wolves.

403
00:47:25,027 --> 00:47:27,518
Come out!
We have a score to settle!

404
00:47:37,673 --> 00:47:39,402
There she is!

405
00:47:42,477 --> 00:47:45,708
Out of the way! You'll get hit!

406
00:47:52,521 --> 00:47:54,386
It's a trap! Stop!

407
00:47:55,524 --> 00:47:59,324
Wolf-God Princess!
Go back to the woods!

408
00:48:02,998 --> 00:48:05,694
Don't die for nothing!

409
00:48:06,468 --> 00:48:07,765
I knew it!

410
00:48:07,836 --> 00:48:10,066
Let him do as he likes.

411
00:48:30,926 --> 00:48:33,190
Got her! She's falling!

412
00:48:33,262 --> 00:48:34,695
Stay back!

413
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:37,621
Even cut off, the head can still bite.

414
00:48:39,868 --> 00:48:41,563
Aim where she falls.

415
00:49:00,255 --> 00:49:01,779
Fire!

416
00:49:10,332 --> 00:49:12,163
Stay back!

417
00:49:20,776 --> 00:49:21,765
Wake up!

418
00:49:27,783 --> 00:49:28,943
No!

419
00:49:48,503 --> 00:49:49,492
Get her!

420
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:51,368
Don't let her go!

421
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,634
Kill her!

422
00:49:56,378 --> 00:49:58,539
Are you all right, sir?

423
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:10,322
Out of my way!

424
00:50:16,164 --> 00:50:19,190
Villain! You're one of them, too!

425
00:50:22,004 --> 00:50:23,164
Halt!

426
00:50:27,242 --> 00:50:28,641
Step aside.

427
00:50:45,594 --> 00:50:47,619
What are you doing?!

428
00:50:47,696 --> 00:50:49,493
The girl is mine.

429
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:53,460
I'm sure she'll make a lovely wife.

430
00:50:53,969 --> 00:50:57,063
There is a demon inside you.
And in her.

431
00:51:02,778 --> 00:51:07,613
Look on this! It is the form
of the hate within me!

432
00:51:08,116 --> 00:51:10,516
It rots my flesh,
and summons my death!

433
00:51:11,753 --> 00:51:13,550
Do not make the hate grow!

434
00:51:13,655 --> 00:51:16,681
Enough talk of your curse!

435
00:51:16,758 --> 00:51:18,350
I'll cut that arm off!.

436
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:25,125
Milady!

437
00:51:27,903 --> 00:51:29,632
Someone take her!

438
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:38,473
Don't worry. She'll be all right.

439
00:51:43,552 --> 00:51:45,543
I will take the girl!

440
00:51:46,421 --> 00:51:49,584
Wait! You don't treat
Lady Eboshi like that!

441
00:51:52,794 --> 00:51:53,954
Don't move!

442
00:52:06,007 --> 00:52:07,668
Kiyo, no!

443
00:52:13,143 --> 00:52:14,474
He still walks...

444
00:52:20,951 --> 00:52:23,579
- How's Milady?
- Safe, sir.

445
00:52:23,653 --> 00:52:27,749
Bring me my gun!
Riflemen, assemble here!

446
00:52:27,824 --> 00:52:29,416
They won't get away!

447
00:52:30,927 --> 00:52:32,588
Toki, quick!

448
00:52:37,701 --> 00:52:39,532
You're...

449
00:52:54,551 --> 00:52:56,246
You can't pass, sir.

450
00:52:56,786 --> 00:52:59,311
The gate can't be opened
without leave.

451
00:53:02,892 --> 00:53:04,359
Turn back, please...

452
00:53:04,427 --> 00:53:08,056
You helped one of us.
We don't want to harm you.

453
00:53:09,232 --> 00:53:13,225
I came on my own two feet.
I will leave on them.

454
00:53:14,704 --> 00:53:17,537
It takes ten men
to open that gate!

455
00:53:25,582 --> 00:53:27,550
Sir, no! You'll die!

456
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:38,190
He moved it!

457
00:53:45,235 --> 00:53:47,032
Move aside!

458
00:53:50,874 --> 00:53:52,307
Wolves!

459
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:53,399
Flint!

460
00:53:53,943 --> 00:53:56,411
Stop! Your princess is safe!

461
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:00,747
I'm coming!

462
00:54:00,817 --> 00:54:02,216
Yakul, let's go!

463
00:54:07,123 --> 00:54:08,613
I thank you.

464
00:54:15,498 --> 00:54:16,897
He's gone...

465
00:54:39,956 --> 00:54:41,116
Wait!

466
00:54:42,959 --> 00:54:44,586
He's mine!

467
00:54:56,106 --> 00:54:59,701
Did they shoot you?
Are you dead?

468
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,711
Why did you stop me?
Speak while you still live!

469
00:55:08,585 --> 00:55:11,247
I didn't want you to die.

470
00:55:11,354 --> 00:55:15,484
I'm not afraid to die
if it will drive the humans away!

471
00:55:16,292 --> 00:55:18,988
I knew that when I first saw you.

472
00:55:19,095 --> 00:55:22,531
You've wasted your life
by getting in my way!

473
00:55:26,603 --> 00:55:29,766
I'll cut your throat!
That'll shut you up!

474
00:55:31,241 --> 00:55:32,230
Live...

475
00:55:32,342 --> 00:55:34,902
I don't listen to humans!

476
00:55:36,846 --> 00:55:39,337
You're beautiful...

477
00:55:42,752 --> 00:55:46,449
What's wrong, San?
Shall I crunch him for you?

478
00:55:58,434 --> 00:55:59,765
The apes...

479
00:56:01,171 --> 00:56:05,540
Apes! Do you mean disrespect
to the tribe of Moro?

480
00:56:06,543 --> 00:56:08,738
This is our forest.

481
00:56:08,812 --> 00:56:10,973
Give us man.

482
00:56:11,047 --> 00:56:14,414
Give us man and go.

483
00:56:14,484 --> 00:56:16,816
Leave, before my fangs find you.

484
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,981
Go.

485
00:56:19,055 --> 00:56:21,285
We eat man.

486
00:56:21,457 --> 00:56:22,822
We eat him.

487
00:56:23,326 --> 00:56:25,055
Let us eat man.

488
00:56:25,128 --> 00:56:29,360
Why would the tribe of the apes...

489
00:56:29,432 --> 00:56:31,798
...want to eat a man?

490
00:56:32,402 --> 00:56:36,839
We eat man. We have his strength.

491
00:56:36,906 --> 00:56:40,342
We want strength
to drive humans away.

492
00:56:40,443 --> 00:56:45,005
You won't get that power
by eating a man.

493
00:56:45,081 --> 00:56:49,074
All that will do is turn you
into something else!

494
00:56:49,586 --> 00:56:55,354
We plant trees.
Humans destroy them.

495
00:56:55,425 --> 00:56:58,588
Forest does not come back.
We kill humans.

496
00:56:59,262 --> 00:57:03,358
The Deer God is with us.
Don't give up. Plant your trees.

497
00:57:03,433 --> 00:57:05,594
We will fight for you to the last!

498
00:57:06,169 --> 00:57:10,196
Deer God will not fight. We die.

499
00:57:10,273 --> 00:57:13,606
Wolf girl not care.
Wolf girl human.

500
00:57:15,278 --> 00:57:18,770
You monkey! I'll break your neck!

501
00:57:21,885 --> 00:57:23,216
Stop it!

502
00:57:31,895 --> 00:57:33,692
It's all right.

503
00:57:33,763 --> 00:57:37,893
You go ahead. I'll take care
of the human.

504
00:57:37,967 --> 00:57:39,628
What about him?

505
00:57:39,702 --> 00:57:41,192
Can we eat him?

506
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:46,732
No. Go on.

507
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:56,550
Come here. Let's be friends.

508
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:00,280
Help me carry your master.

509
00:59:55,872 --> 00:59:59,808
You're smart. You know
not to set foot on this island.

510
01:00:01,377 --> 01:00:02,867
Humans stink!

511
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,582
Go where you will. You're free.

512
01:01:47,881 --> 01:01:49,678
There he is!

513
01:01:50,517 --> 01:01:53,350
The night-walker! At last!

514
01:01:53,854 --> 01:01:55,344
Quick! Come and look!

515
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:59,316
There's why we've been sitting
in these stinking bearskins!

516
01:02:00,127 --> 01:02:02,027
Don't look! You'll go blind!

517
01:02:02,696 --> 01:02:05,597
This from the West Land's
best hunter?

518
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:08,464
This is a charter from the Mikado...

519
01:02:08,535 --> 01:02:11,265
...allowing us
to subdue the Deer God!

520
01:02:17,044 --> 01:02:19,979
At night he becomes
the night-walker.

521
01:02:20,047 --> 01:02:22,811
As night becomes day
he changes form.

522
01:02:22,883 --> 01:02:27,286
He's vanishing...over there!

523
01:03:50,003 --> 01:03:51,197
Jiko!

524
01:03:51,271 --> 01:03:53,000
I know.

525
01:03:53,807 --> 01:03:55,297
Over there.

526
01:04:08,522 --> 01:04:10,888
There's hundreds of them.

527
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:13,358
They're not from these woods.

528
01:04:13,427 --> 01:04:15,793
They're lords of some other mountain.

529
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:25,538
It's Okkoto!

530
01:04:25,606 --> 01:04:28,336
From the South Island?

531
01:04:28,408 --> 01:04:30,433
There's no mistaking those tusks.

532
01:04:31,244 --> 01:04:33,678
Looks like he brought his whole tribe!

533
01:04:36,817 --> 01:04:38,808
He's seen us! Fall back!

534
01:04:52,232 --> 01:04:54,393
Come on! Jump!

535
01:05:47,788 --> 01:05:49,551
There's no wound!

536
01:05:59,766 --> 01:06:01,097
Yakul...

537
01:06:24,591 --> 01:06:28,857
If you're awake thankYakul.
He watched you the whole time.

538
01:06:30,797 --> 01:06:32,628
How do you know his name?

539
01:06:33,667 --> 01:06:38,764
He's told me all about you,
your village, your forest...

540
01:06:39,539 --> 01:06:43,202
The Deer God brought you
back to life, so I'll help you.

541
01:06:44,878 --> 01:06:48,575
I had this dream...a golden deer...

542
01:06:48,648 --> 01:06:49,808
Eat.

543
01:06:55,288 --> 01:06:56,277
Chew.

544
01:08:26,081 --> 01:08:29,778
We're here to kill the humans
and save the forest.

545
01:08:29,852 --> 01:08:31,786
Why are there humans here?

546
01:08:31,887 --> 01:08:34,355
The girl is San, my daughter.

547
01:08:34,423 --> 01:08:40,020
The humans are everywhere. Go back
to your mountain and kill them there.

548
01:08:40,729 --> 01:08:44,256
We kill for the forest
of the Deer God.

549
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:46,733
Why is there a man here?

550
01:08:47,503 --> 01:08:51,439
The Deer God healed his wound.
We must give him back.

551
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:56,978
The Deer God saved him?
The Deer God healed his wound?!

552
01:08:58,013 --> 01:09:00,948
Why did he not save Nago?

553
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:04,451
Is he not guardian of the forest?!

554
01:09:04,553 --> 01:09:08,785
The Deer God gives life,
and takes it away.

555
01:09:08,858 --> 01:09:12,555
Have you boars forgotten even that?

556
01:09:13,062 --> 01:09:17,260
No! You begged the Deer God for him.

557
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:19,324
You did not beg for Nago!

558
01:09:19,969 --> 01:09:24,167
He feared death...l, like him...

559
01:09:24,273 --> 01:09:28,505
...carry within me
a poisoned human stone.

560
01:09:28,577 --> 01:09:33,037
Nago fled. I remain,
and contemplate my death.

561
01:09:33,115 --> 01:09:35,015
Go to the Deer God!

562
01:09:35,084 --> 01:09:38,349
I have lived long enough, San.

563
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:41,685
The Deer God will take my life.

564
01:09:42,191 --> 01:09:44,921
No, Mother! You've protected
the Deer God!

565
01:09:45,494 --> 01:09:50,522
We are not fooled! Nago was beautiful
and strong. Our brother would not run!

566
01:09:51,166 --> 01:09:53,760
You wolves ate him!

567
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:57,136
Silence! You slander my mother!

568
01:09:57,473 --> 01:10:00,271
Hear me, O wild mountain gods...

569
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:04,043
It was I who killed Nago.

570
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:08,682
He had become a demon,
and attacked our village.

571
01:10:09,184 --> 01:10:12,779
A huge boar. Here is my proof.

572
01:10:18,594 --> 01:10:22,792
I came to this land to ask
the Deer God to lift this curse.

573
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:27,294
He healed my wound,
but the scar remains.

574
01:10:28,971 --> 01:10:33,305
I must suffer until
the curse destroys me.

575
01:10:37,813 --> 01:10:41,681
Okkoto! Good! Someone who can listen.

576
01:10:46,488 --> 01:10:47,512
Okkoto, wait!

577
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:49,751
You mustn't eat him!

578
01:10:51,827 --> 01:10:56,161
You are Moro's daughter.
I have heard of you.

579
01:10:57,733 --> 01:10:59,166
Your eyes...

580
01:10:59,768 --> 01:11:02,669
Stand back. I will not eat him.

581
01:11:03,038 --> 01:11:04,164
Wolf-God Princess...

582
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:08,874
Do not fear. I tell of Nago's end.

583
01:11:22,124 --> 01:11:25,685
My thanks to you, young one.

584
01:11:25,761 --> 01:11:32,098
It grieves us that a demon
has come from our tribe.

585
01:11:33,769 --> 01:11:37,500
Lord Okkoto...do you know
how I may lift the curse?

586
01:11:38,807 --> 01:11:44,245
Leave this forest. When next we meet,
I will have to kill you.

587
01:11:44,747 --> 01:11:49,241
You cannot win against
the guns of the humans.

588
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:54,914
Look on my tribe, Moro.
We grow small, and we grow stupid.

589
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:57,288
To go on in this manner...

590
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:00,988
...is to end as game
the humans hunt for meat.

591
01:12:01,096 --> 01:12:05,931
To risk all on a final battle
is to play into human hands.

592
01:12:06,568 --> 01:12:09,935
I ask not for the help of wolves.

593
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:16,868
Should we die even to the very last,
we will leave the humans in awe.

594
01:12:42,304 --> 01:12:43,794
The Deer God!

595
01:13:00,020 --> 01:13:02,511
Keep the oxen together!

596
01:13:05,925 --> 01:13:07,756
Hold your fire...let them come!

597
01:13:08,962 --> 01:13:10,122
Fire!

598
01:13:16,169 --> 01:13:17,568
Reload! Quick!

599
01:13:32,652 --> 01:13:36,349
That damned Eboshi's fighting
the wrong enemy!

600
01:13:36,423 --> 01:13:39,085
You go on ahead and hide.

601
01:14:00,447 --> 01:14:02,677
Here they come!

602
01:14:08,321 --> 01:14:09,720
Chief...

603
01:14:09,789 --> 01:14:11,188
Well done.

604
01:14:11,891 --> 01:14:15,054
We're moving out. Tell the others.

605
01:14:19,632 --> 01:14:21,224
Hello, Jiko.

606
01:14:21,301 --> 01:14:25,931
The Emperor presses, and you sport
with country samurai...

607
01:14:26,606 --> 01:14:30,098
Lord Asano sets them against me.

608
01:14:30,510 --> 01:14:33,343
Asano? A powerful man...

609
01:14:33,413 --> 01:14:35,779
He wants my iron.

610
01:14:35,849 --> 01:14:37,578
Greedy, isn't he.

611
01:14:38,418 --> 01:14:41,285
But now is no time to fight men.

612
01:14:41,354 --> 01:14:44,221
The boars are gathering in the forest.

613
01:14:45,158 --> 01:14:47,388
Give him the iron.

614
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:51,226
Keep your promise to the Emperor,
then smash Asano.

615
01:14:51,331 --> 01:14:54,858
Quick, Milady!
Asano's men are coming!

616
01:15:00,206 --> 01:15:03,198
Speak of the devil! A messenger.

617
01:15:03,276 --> 01:15:06,109
A messenger.
Remember your manners.

618
01:15:09,015 --> 01:15:10,676
Welcome home!

619
01:15:13,486 --> 01:15:15,579
Aren't you going to see him?

620
01:15:19,025 --> 01:15:24,224
Eboshi, Mistress of the ironworks,
you have fought well!

621
01:15:25,431 --> 01:15:30,198
I bring a message from my lord.
Open your gates!

622
01:15:30,303 --> 01:15:33,272
We hear you fine from there!

623
01:15:33,339 --> 01:15:36,206
Milady took this mountain
from the boars!

624
01:15:36,276 --> 01:15:38,506
Now it's worth something
and you want it!

625
01:15:38,611 --> 01:15:40,078
On your way!

626
01:15:40,146 --> 01:15:42,774
You have no respect, woman!

627
01:15:42,916 --> 01:15:44,440
No respect?

628
01:15:44,517 --> 01:15:49,420
We haven't had respect
since we were born!

629
01:15:49,489 --> 01:15:51,980
You want iron? Have some!

630
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:02,896
They're really something!

631
01:16:02,973 --> 01:16:05,669
Samurai or forest god,
they don't care.

632
01:16:06,376 --> 01:16:09,777
Eboshi's women don't lack courage.

633
01:16:11,682 --> 01:16:13,547
What good is this paper?

634
01:16:14,184 --> 01:16:17,483
Well, it's helped in getting
the best hunters and trackers.

635
01:16:17,554 --> 01:16:20,489
We're after gods, not just beasts.

636
01:16:21,892 --> 01:16:23,723
Yes, Milady?

637
01:16:24,061 --> 01:16:26,723
Do you know who this paper is from?

638
01:16:27,197 --> 01:16:28,664
The Mikado.

639
01:16:28,732 --> 01:16:31,030
- Mikado?
- Who's he?

640
01:16:31,602 --> 01:16:33,092
The Emperor.

641
01:16:33,770 --> 01:16:36,864
They're really something!

642
01:16:37,307 --> 01:16:38,740
Off you go.

643
01:16:40,444 --> 01:16:44,881
As we make iron here,
the forest grows weak.

644
01:16:44,948 --> 01:16:47,007
That way costs fewer lives.

645
01:16:47,851 --> 01:16:50,342
We've spent too much time
and money.

646
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:54,379
We didn't send 40 riflemen
just for the iron.

647
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:57,450
So the Emperor says, at least.

648
01:16:57,561 --> 01:17:02,521
Surely he doesn't believe that the
Deer God's head confers immortality?

649
01:17:02,633 --> 01:17:07,002
I'm not privy to the thoughts
of the Emperor.

650
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:08,298
Best not to be.

651
01:17:09,606 --> 01:17:11,130
You have my word.

652
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:15,577
The boars will be easier
than Moro and her tribe.

653
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:20,311
Call out that shady bunch
you've got hidden under the cliff.

654
01:17:20,984 --> 01:17:25,182
So I'm found out, am l?

655
01:17:25,255 --> 01:17:27,587
One more thing...

656
01:17:27,991 --> 01:17:30,084
Did a young man pass by here?

657
01:17:30,794 --> 01:17:33,592
Riding a red elk?

658
01:17:34,164 --> 01:17:35,495
He left.

659
01:17:55,085 --> 01:17:57,053
They make my skin crawl!

660
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,954
They're not ordinary hunters.
They're special scouts.

661
01:18:01,758 --> 01:18:03,749
Let us go with you!

662
01:18:03,827 --> 01:18:05,454
Don't trust those men!

663
01:18:06,129 --> 01:18:08,927
We can't help you from here
if anything happens!

664
01:18:08,999 --> 01:18:10,694
We've learned how to shoot...

665
01:18:11,368 --> 01:18:14,565
That's the reason I want you here.

666
01:18:15,072 --> 01:18:17,939
I fear humans more than forest gods.

667
01:18:19,142 --> 01:18:22,805
With the Deer God dead,
things will become clear.

668
01:18:22,879 --> 01:18:26,838
Is the Deer God's head
all the Emperor really wants?

669
01:18:27,818 --> 01:18:31,413
We may have to fight
the riflemen, too.

670
01:18:32,489 --> 01:18:35,925
We can't trust men.
Stay on your toes.

671
01:18:36,526 --> 01:18:40,690
Don't worry about Lady Eboshi.
I'll protect her.

672
01:18:40,764 --> 01:18:43,130
- You will, will you?
- What?!

673
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,600
Maybe if you were a woman...

674
01:19:55,639 --> 01:19:56,970
Does it hurt?

675
01:19:59,176 --> 01:20:02,873
You could end it all
by jumping, you know.

676
01:20:02,946 --> 01:20:06,177
When your strength returns,
the scar will grow restless.

677
01:20:07,384 --> 01:20:09,818
I feel like I've slept for days.

678
01:20:10,554 --> 01:20:13,182
I dreamed San was tending to me.

679
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:20,219
I hoped you would cry out in your sleep,
so I could bite off your head.

680
01:20:20,297 --> 01:20:22,288
A beautiful woods...

681
01:20:22,365 --> 01:20:24,196
Are the boars moving yet?

682
01:20:24,801 --> 01:20:28,737
Go back into the cave, boy.
You can't hear it...

683
01:20:28,805 --> 01:20:31,706
The cry of the woods
trampled under by boars...

684
01:20:32,809 --> 01:20:37,712
I sit here listening to it
and to the crumbling of my body...

685
01:20:37,781 --> 01:20:40,181
...and wait for that woman...

686
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:43,777
...dreaming of the moment
I crush her head in my jaws.

687
01:20:44,421 --> 01:20:47,879
Can't humans and the forest
live together in peace?

688
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:49,815
Can't this be stopped?

689
01:20:49,926 --> 01:20:52,520
The humans are gathering.

690
01:20:52,596 --> 01:20:55,190
Their fire will reach even here.

691
01:20:55,298 --> 01:20:58,699
And San? Do you intend
to take her with you?

692
01:20:58,802 --> 01:21:02,704
How like a human
to think only of himself!.

693
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:09,242
She is a daughter of our tribe.
When the woods die, so will she.

694
01:21:09,346 --> 01:21:11,940
Set her free! She's human!

695
01:21:12,616 --> 01:21:14,049
Silence, boy!

696
01:21:14,117 --> 01:21:17,109
What can you do for her?

697
01:21:18,021 --> 01:21:23,960
The humans who violated the forest
threw her in my path as they ran from me.

698
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:27,427
Now she cannot be human,
and she cannot be wolf.

699
01:21:27,497 --> 01:21:30,989
My poor, ugly,
lovely daughter...

700
01:21:31,101 --> 01:21:33,592
Can you save her?!

701
01:21:35,505 --> 01:21:38,338
I don't know,
but together we can live.

702
01:21:40,644 --> 01:21:45,513
How? Will you join with San
and fight the human race?

703
01:21:46,283 --> 01:21:49,013
No. All that does is cause more hatred.

704
01:21:49,586 --> 01:21:54,046
There is nothing you can do, boy.

705
01:21:54,124 --> 01:21:57,321
Soon the scar will kill you.

706
01:21:57,394 --> 01:21:59,726
Leave here when the sun rises.

707
01:22:13,944 --> 01:22:14,968
Can you walk?

708
01:22:17,781 --> 01:22:20,477
Thanks to you and the Deer God.

709
01:23:21,678 --> 01:23:24,272
Yakul! Were you worried?

710
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:31,382
My legs are so weak!

711
01:24:03,045 --> 01:24:05,673
It's so quiet...where are the kodama?

712
01:24:12,388 --> 01:24:15,118
I can smell the ironworks...

713
01:24:22,031 --> 01:24:25,865
Thank you for guiding me.
I have a favor to ask you.

714
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:29,961
Give this to San.

715
01:24:38,547 --> 01:24:39,878
Let's go.

716
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:13,546
What a stench!

717
01:25:13,615 --> 01:25:18,382
That's not just smoke.
It's to blunt our sense of smell.

718
01:25:18,454 --> 01:25:19,443
That woman!

719
01:25:29,298 --> 01:25:30,788
She knows we're here...

720
01:25:30,866 --> 01:25:34,097
- It's a foolish trap.
- A trap?

721
01:25:34,603 --> 01:25:38,733
They're trying to lure the boars
out of the woods.

722
01:25:38,807 --> 01:25:40,604
They're planning something.

723
01:25:40,709 --> 01:25:44,645
We've got to warn them!
They'll be killed!

724
01:25:45,447 --> 01:25:47,915
Okkoto is no fool.

725
01:25:47,983 --> 01:25:52,511
The boars know it's a trap,
but still they'll charge.

726
01:25:52,588 --> 01:25:55,148
They are a proud race.

727
01:25:55,891 --> 01:25:59,884
The last one alive
will still be charging forward.

728
01:26:04,867 --> 01:26:06,391
They're cutting trees.

729
01:26:06,468 --> 01:26:08,299
To anger them.

730
01:26:10,906 --> 01:26:13,466
Mother, this is farewell.

731
01:26:13,542 --> 01:26:16,238
The smoke will blind Okkoto.

732
01:26:16,311 --> 01:26:17,801
I will be his eyes.

733
01:26:18,747 --> 01:26:20,544
As you will.

734
01:26:20,616 --> 01:26:24,780
Although there is a life for you
with that boy...

735
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,020
I hate humans!

736
01:26:38,967 --> 01:26:41,458
From Ashitaka? For me?

737
01:26:45,207 --> 01:26:46,231
It's pretty...

738
01:26:47,009 --> 01:26:48,772
You two go with San.

739
01:26:48,877 --> 01:26:52,643
- I will stay with the Deer God.
- Let's go.

740
01:27:13,769 --> 01:27:17,637
The tribe of Moro fights with you!
Where is Okkoto?

741
01:27:20,742 --> 01:27:22,039
Thank you.

742
01:28:47,626 --> 01:28:48,991
The ironworks!

743
01:28:54,833 --> 01:28:55,993
Let's go!

744
01:28:59,838 --> 01:29:00,862
Who goes there?!

745
01:29:01,173 --> 01:29:02,162
Samurai!

746
01:29:04,242 --> 01:29:05,231
Halt!

747
01:29:06,311 --> 01:29:07,801
Let me pass!

748
01:29:24,429 --> 01:29:25,896
Who was that?!

749
01:29:29,901 --> 01:29:32,392
He's stopping them!

750
01:29:33,038 --> 01:29:34,767
Don't waste your arrows!

751
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:00,256
Quick!

752
01:30:00,332 --> 01:30:01,924
You're right! It is him!

753
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:02,989
In the flesh!

754
01:30:03,068 --> 01:30:05,366
Ashitaka!

755
01:30:05,437 --> 01:30:06,426
Toki?

756
01:30:06,938 --> 01:30:08,235
Are you all right?

757
01:30:08,306 --> 01:30:09,671
As you see us!

758
01:30:09,774 --> 01:30:14,302
They thought they'd catch us
while the men were away!

759
01:30:14,379 --> 01:30:16,006
We showed 'em!

760
01:30:16,081 --> 01:30:18,914
- They thought we'd be easy!
- Where's Lady Eboshi?

761
01:30:19,017 --> 01:30:23,647
She took every man who could move
and went to kill the Deer God.

762
01:30:23,722 --> 01:30:25,713
We're cut off and can't reach her!

763
01:30:25,824 --> 01:30:29,225
The Deer God?
So that sound before...

764
01:30:29,327 --> 01:30:31,955
Sir! I've still got your bow!

765
01:30:32,030 --> 01:30:34,590
What about his saddle and cloak?!

766
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:36,190
- But...
- Useless!

767
01:30:36,835 --> 01:30:38,496
Koroku, thanks!

768
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:41,232
I'll bring help. Can you hold out?

769
01:30:41,339 --> 01:30:44,797
We'll pour hot iron on them
if we have to!

770
01:30:44,876 --> 01:30:46,400
Hurry, Ashitaka!

771
01:30:46,478 --> 01:30:48,503
Bring Lady Eboshi!

772
01:30:53,685 --> 01:30:54,879
Missed!

773
01:30:54,953 --> 01:30:56,944
They're bringing boats. Hurry!

774
01:30:57,022 --> 01:31:00,924
Bring Lady Eboshi! We'll fight, too!

775
01:31:02,661 --> 01:31:04,561
I'll be back!

776
01:31:07,399 --> 01:31:09,629
We'll be here!

777
01:31:12,871 --> 01:31:14,236
Get that man!

778
01:31:24,215 --> 01:31:26,149
They're after us, Yakul!

779
01:32:09,127 --> 01:32:11,118
Burning flesh...

780
01:32:17,202 --> 01:32:18,499
Yakul!

781
01:32:57,409 --> 01:32:58,501
Stay back!

782
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:13,280
Show me the wound...

783
01:33:15,193 --> 01:33:17,787
Wait here. I'll be right back.

784
01:33:20,732 --> 01:33:22,222
Stay, I said!

785
01:33:33,211 --> 01:33:34,769
We're almost there...

786
01:34:19,190 --> 01:34:20,452
Who goes there?!

787
01:34:21,126 --> 01:34:24,562
Outsiders are not allowed here.

788
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:30,060
I have a message for Lady Eboshi.

789
01:34:30,568 --> 01:34:34,334
She's not here. State your business
and I'll pass it on.

790
01:34:35,039 --> 01:34:37,200
I will speak to her! Where is she?!

791
01:34:37,308 --> 01:34:41,039
Young sir...so you're alive...

792
01:34:41,646 --> 01:34:43,511
You've had a bad time...

793
01:34:43,581 --> 01:34:45,446
There's still men buried.

794
01:34:45,517 --> 01:34:46,677
It was horrible...

795
01:34:47,352 --> 01:34:49,343
The ironworks are under attack.

796
01:34:50,088 --> 01:34:54,354
There's still time. The women are
holding the inner stockade.

797
01:34:54,425 --> 01:34:55,756
The bastards!

798
01:34:55,827 --> 01:34:58,193
Asano waited till we left!

799
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:00,493
Where's Lady Eboshi?

800
01:35:00,565 --> 01:35:03,295
She's gone after the Deer God.

801
01:35:03,368 --> 01:35:05,199
Call her back!

802
01:35:05,904 --> 01:35:08,270
If you're done, get out of here!

803
01:35:08,339 --> 01:35:09,328
Back to work!

804
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,135
And the ironworks?

805
01:35:11,209 --> 01:35:12,938
Now wait a minute!

806
01:35:13,344 --> 01:35:15,567
They want to abandon the ironworks!

807
01:35:16,368 --> 01:35:18,336
If we wait we'll be too late!

808
01:35:18,403 --> 01:35:20,064
Send a messenger!

809
01:35:20,138 --> 01:35:23,266
The woods are huge.
He'd never find her!

810
01:35:23,408 --> 01:35:26,275
Send one of your trackers!

811
01:35:26,912 --> 01:35:29,574
Lady Eboshi's being used.

812
01:35:30,282 --> 01:35:33,547
Were there any wolves
with the boars?

813
01:35:33,619 --> 01:35:35,917
San, er, the wolf girl?

814
01:35:35,988 --> 01:35:39,515
I don't know...it was pitch black
when they came at us.

815
01:35:39,591 --> 01:35:41,525
She was there.

816
01:35:41,927 --> 01:35:44,862
We were in the front...

817
01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:46,022
And?

818
01:35:46,098 --> 01:35:50,228
I don't know. Suddenly
I didn't know what was going on.

819
01:35:50,302 --> 01:35:53,601
The scouts put us out there
to lure the boars in.

820
01:35:53,672 --> 01:35:55,799
There were mines underneath us...

821
01:35:55,874 --> 01:35:58,069
...and grenades from above.

822
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:53,120
Where's San?!

823
01:36:56,802 --> 01:36:59,930
Be still! I want to help you.

824
01:37:03,508 --> 01:37:07,171
A wolf!. There's a wolf
still alive over here!

825
01:37:07,245 --> 01:37:08,405
Sir, what...

826
01:37:12,884 --> 01:37:13,873
Sir!

827
01:37:13,952 --> 01:37:16,147
Move! What are you doing, boy?!

828
01:37:17,222 --> 01:37:20,885
He's going to take me to Eboshi.

829
01:37:20,992 --> 01:37:23,893
So you're with them, are you?

830
01:37:24,396 --> 01:37:25,761
Move.

831
01:37:26,465 --> 01:37:30,128
What's more important, the head of
the Deer God or the ironworks?!

832
01:37:30,802 --> 01:37:31,996
Poison darts!

833
01:37:38,210 --> 01:37:39,438
Stop!

834
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:48,077
Give me a hand!

835
01:37:58,330 --> 01:37:59,820
He's out!

836
01:38:11,409 --> 01:38:14,537
Go through the swamp
and hide near the lake.

837
01:38:14,946 --> 01:38:17,608
The riflemen are with them.
Be careful.

838
01:38:18,216 --> 01:38:21,344
Take this. My last arrow's broken.

839
01:38:23,488 --> 01:38:24,819
You go with them.

840
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:26,585
Take care of him!

841
01:38:30,295 --> 01:38:32,422
Find San! That's where Eboshi is!

842
01:38:44,376 --> 01:38:47,777
Don't fall behind the scouts.
Today we finish this!

843
01:38:50,649 --> 01:38:51,775
Jiko...

844
01:38:51,850 --> 01:38:53,818
Well? How does it look?

845
01:38:53,919 --> 01:38:58,822
Okkoto's hurt. He and the girl
are going to the Deer God.

846
01:38:59,491 --> 01:39:02,858
So they're going to ask him
for help...stay with them.

847
01:39:03,562 --> 01:39:06,122
But stay hidden, or he won't appear.

848
01:39:06,198 --> 01:39:08,291
Of course.

849
01:39:09,167 --> 01:39:12,159
Is that boar's blood on his face?

850
01:39:12,571 --> 01:39:15,301
That's how they trick the boars.

851
01:39:23,381 --> 01:39:26,839
Keep going! We're almost at
the Deer God's pond.

852
01:39:44,302 --> 01:39:45,792
Something's coming!

853
01:39:48,573 --> 01:39:51,736
Something's wrong, Okkoto!
Just a bit further!

854
01:39:52,477 --> 01:39:54,342
Something bad is coming.

855
01:39:54,412 --> 01:39:57,404
There's too much blood.
I can't smell what it is.

856
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,378
The apes!

857
01:40:03,488 --> 01:40:05,183
You did this.

858
01:40:05,257 --> 01:40:07,623
It is your fault. Forest will die.

859
01:40:08,193 --> 01:40:12,129
Is this how you thank those
who fought for your forest?

860
01:40:12,230 --> 01:40:14,391
You brought ruin.

861
01:40:14,466 --> 01:40:17,128
Things neither animal nor human!

862
01:40:17,736 --> 01:40:20,227
Neither animal nor human?

863
01:40:26,344 --> 01:40:28,744
- They're here!
- It's the end!

864
01:40:48,199 --> 01:40:49,257
Warriors!

865
01:40:52,637 --> 01:40:54,264
They've returned!

866
01:40:55,640 --> 01:41:01,510
My warriors have returned
from the land of the dead!

867
01:41:05,483 --> 01:41:10,648
Forward, my warriors!
To the Deer God!

868
01:41:16,995 --> 01:41:20,897
Okkoto, no! Your warriors
haven't come back to life!

869
01:41:26,338 --> 01:41:28,829
They wear boar skins
to hide their scent!

870
01:41:28,940 --> 01:41:30,271
They're men!

871
01:41:32,978 --> 01:41:36,744
Stop! They want us to take them
to the Deer God!

872
01:41:41,219 --> 01:41:43,187
Come out, Deer God!

873
01:41:43,254 --> 01:41:49,090
If you are lord of this forest,
revive my warriors to slay the humans.

874
01:41:51,029 --> 01:41:53,088
Okkoto! Still your heart!

875
01:41:53,932 --> 01:41:57,095
We're surrounded! He's done for.
Leave him!

876
01:41:57,202 --> 01:42:00,103
No! Then he'll become a demon!

877
01:42:00,872 --> 01:42:04,603
Tell Mother it's the Deer God
the humans want!

878
01:42:05,143 --> 01:42:07,577
She'll know what to do!

879
01:42:09,381 --> 01:42:11,645
We can't let our kind die out!

880
01:42:13,084 --> 01:42:14,312
Go!

881
01:42:33,671 --> 01:42:38,665
I'll kill the first one that moves,
and tell the whole forest what you are!

882
01:42:49,654 --> 01:42:51,144
Ashitaka?

883
01:42:57,529 --> 01:42:58,518
Bastards!

884
01:43:05,703 --> 01:43:09,969
I burn! A flame bursts from within me!

885
01:43:11,443 --> 01:43:13,158
No!

886
01:43:13,292 --> 01:43:16,193
No, Okkoto! Don't turn into a demon!

887
01:43:18,130 --> 01:43:19,654
Okkoto!

888
01:43:22,334 --> 01:43:23,358
An answer!

889
01:43:27,272 --> 01:43:28,296
What is it?

890
01:43:28,373 --> 01:43:30,034
- San's in danger!
- Let's go!

891
01:43:58,570 --> 01:44:00,003
I'm hot!

892
01:44:08,981 --> 01:44:10,107
No!

893
01:44:10,182 --> 01:44:13,276
I don't want to be a monster!
Okkoto!

894
01:44:24,930 --> 01:44:26,295
Too slow! Get on!

895
01:44:40,712 --> 01:44:42,304
A wolf!.

896
01:44:44,916 --> 01:44:45,905
Eboshi!

897
01:44:52,858 --> 01:44:54,519
Go on ahead!

898
01:44:55,894 --> 01:44:57,987
Eboshi, listen!

899
01:44:58,096 --> 01:44:59,461
Stop!

900
01:44:59,531 --> 01:45:00,520
Ashitaka?

901
01:45:01,366 --> 01:45:06,030
The samurai are attacking the ironworks!
The women are fighting back!

902
01:45:06,571 --> 01:45:07,799
Leave the Deer God!

903
01:45:08,774 --> 01:45:12,574
The men are heading back!
They're waiting for you!

904
01:45:13,178 --> 01:45:15,510
What proof do you have?

905
01:45:15,580 --> 01:45:19,072
None! I would have stayed
and fought if I could!

906
01:45:19,685 --> 01:45:23,212
So it's 'don't kill the Deer God,
kill the samurai,' is it?

907
01:45:23,755 --> 01:45:27,851
No! Can't the forest
and the ironworks live together?

908
01:45:30,262 --> 01:45:32,093
Whose side is he on?

909
01:45:32,164 --> 01:45:33,290
Let's go back!

910
01:45:34,099 --> 01:45:39,298
I've done all I can for the women.
They can defend themselves.

911
01:45:41,573 --> 01:45:44,371
There's the pond. He's around here!

912
01:45:45,711 --> 01:45:47,941
It's now or never. Stay alert.

913
01:45:49,014 --> 01:45:50,641
Do we need her?

914
01:45:50,716 --> 01:45:54,243
We're killing a god.
Let her do it for us.

915
01:46:21,079 --> 01:46:22,876
Moro! Are you dead?

916
01:46:22,948 --> 01:46:24,313
San!

917
01:46:24,383 --> 01:46:25,714
Where are you?

918
01:46:26,585 --> 01:46:27,916
San!

919
01:46:35,594 --> 01:46:36,652
Ashitaka!

920
01:46:44,269 --> 01:46:45,258
Okkoto...

921
01:46:53,578 --> 01:46:54,567
Leave, boy.

922
01:46:55,881 --> 01:46:58,406
If we fight, the Deer God won't come.

923
01:47:03,054 --> 01:47:05,921
Okkoto! Be still!

924
01:47:10,061 --> 01:47:13,861
Okkoto! Give me the girl!
Where is San?

925
01:47:14,699 --> 01:47:17,725
San, can you hear me?
It's me, Ashitaka!

926
01:47:24,042 --> 01:47:25,304
San!

927
01:47:32,284 --> 01:47:33,945
Shut him up!

928
01:47:38,623 --> 01:47:40,523
Shoot him down!

929
01:48:04,749 --> 01:48:05,977
San!

930
01:48:08,620 --> 01:48:09,951
San!

931
01:48:12,791 --> 01:48:14,281
Ashitaka!

932
01:48:18,363 --> 01:48:19,660
San!

933
01:48:19,764 --> 01:48:20,822
Ashitaka!

934
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:34,977
And here I was saving my last bit
of strength for that woman...

935
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:37,105
Close up!

936
01:48:54,699 --> 01:48:57,224
Stay away from him.

937
01:48:57,302 --> 01:48:59,065
The curse will fall on you.

938
01:49:08,613 --> 01:49:10,308
Can you not even speak now?

939
01:49:11,516 --> 01:49:16,010
Well done. Fall back
and tend to the wounded.

940
01:49:17,422 --> 01:49:19,947
A horrible sight!

941
01:49:28,333 --> 01:49:29,322
There he is!

942
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:44,742
Give me back my daughter!

943
01:50:06,538 --> 01:50:08,062
Ashitaka...

944
01:50:08,139 --> 01:50:10,539
Can you save San?

945
01:50:20,051 --> 01:50:21,780
The Deer God...

946
01:50:32,631 --> 01:50:33,962
Don't shoot!

947
01:50:47,912 --> 01:50:52,110
Eboshi! Your enemy is not
the Deer God!

948
01:50:52,651 --> 01:50:53,948
Guns can't hurt him...

949
01:50:54,019 --> 01:50:55,384
Only through the head...

950
01:51:05,230 --> 01:51:06,219
San!

951
01:51:16,378 --> 01:51:17,709
Don't die!

952
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:47,770
Is the Deer God taking life?!

953
01:52:08,063 --> 01:52:10,088
He's starting to change!

954
01:52:10,165 --> 01:52:11,689
Watch closely.

955
01:52:12,367 --> 01:52:14,426
This is how you kill a god.

956
01:52:14,536 --> 01:52:17,130
He is also the god of death.

957
01:52:17,673 --> 01:52:19,834
Do not shrink back.

958
01:52:36,258 --> 01:52:37,919
Stop!

959
01:52:40,963 --> 01:52:41,952
Eboshi!

960
01:52:54,176 --> 01:52:56,838
You damn freak!

961
01:53:06,855 --> 01:53:09,153
Got him! Get the head!

962
01:53:48,397 --> 01:53:51,161
Jiko! Bring the box!

963
01:53:51,767 --> 01:53:54,759
The porters are dead! Quick!

964
01:53:56,371 --> 01:53:59,932
Don't touch the body!
It'll draw your life into it!

965
01:54:03,979 --> 01:54:06,174
One head, as promised.

966
01:54:14,823 --> 01:54:16,450
Milady!

967
01:54:16,525 --> 01:54:18,925
Moro's head...it moved by itself!.

968
01:54:19,461 --> 01:54:23,124
Come on, hurry! Run!

969
01:54:23,198 --> 01:54:24,187
Jiko!

970
01:54:27,469 --> 01:54:29,232
Run!

971
01:54:45,954 --> 01:54:47,114
To the island!

972
01:54:47,222 --> 01:54:48,621
I can't swim!

973
01:54:48,690 --> 01:54:50,351
Then wade!

974
01:55:18,553 --> 01:55:20,783
Give her to me! I'll kill her!

975
01:55:20,856 --> 01:55:23,984
Moro's already taken her revenge.

976
01:55:24,526 --> 01:55:25,584
Milady!

977
01:55:25,660 --> 01:55:26,888
Help me!

978
01:55:30,365 --> 01:55:32,833
Don't waste your sympathy...

979
01:55:33,368 --> 01:55:36,337
I promised Toki I'd bring you back.

980
01:55:42,210 --> 01:55:45,008
He's looking for his head.
We can't stay here.

981
01:55:45,080 --> 01:55:46,069
San!

982
01:55:46,648 --> 01:55:47,740
Help me!

983
01:55:47,816 --> 01:55:50,478
No! You're on their side!

984
01:55:50,552 --> 01:55:52,452
Take that woman and go away!

985
01:55:55,624 --> 01:55:57,649
Keep away! I hate humans!

986
01:55:58,860 --> 01:56:02,159
I am human...and so are you.

987
01:56:02,264 --> 01:56:05,199
Shut up! I'm a wolf!.

988
01:56:06,568 --> 01:56:08,058
Keep back!

989
01:56:13,842 --> 01:56:17,039
I'm sorry. I tried to stop it.

990
01:56:24,219 --> 01:56:28,280
It's over. Everything.
The forest is dead.

991
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:42,059
No, it's not. We're still alive.
Help me.

992
01:57:08,029 --> 01:57:09,894
Wait! Help us!

993
01:57:09,998 --> 01:57:12,762
A little crisis and they're useless!

994
01:57:16,104 --> 01:57:17,867
Don't stop!

995
01:57:23,478 --> 01:57:25,173
The head's moving!

996
01:57:28,283 --> 01:57:30,046
It's calling him here!

997
01:58:13,461 --> 01:58:14,587
That's fixed it.

998
01:58:14,663 --> 01:58:15,925
Thanks.

999
01:58:16,264 --> 01:58:17,822
It's very quiet...

1000
01:58:17,899 --> 01:58:19,526
They're waiting for dawn.

1001
01:58:20,635 --> 01:58:23,934
I wonder if that young man
found Eboshi...

1002
01:58:24,005 --> 01:58:28,999
I'm sure he did.
She's probably almost here now.

1003
01:58:31,279 --> 01:58:35,306
Look at that face! Hey, Koroku!

1004
01:58:35,383 --> 01:58:38,375
Let him sleep for now.

1005
01:58:48,430 --> 01:58:50,990
I don't like the sound of that...

1006
01:59:03,578 --> 01:59:04,806
The night-walker!

1007
01:59:18,612 --> 01:59:20,910
Hold your positions!

1008
01:59:21,448 --> 01:59:23,416
He's coming this way!

1009
01:59:23,483 --> 01:59:24,472
Run!

1010
01:59:25,185 --> 01:59:28,882
We guard the ironworks!
We promised Milady we would.

1011
01:59:34,961 --> 01:59:37,088
It's him! Ashitaka!

1012
01:59:42,436 --> 01:59:43,425
Get out!

1013
01:59:44,237 --> 01:59:47,070
The Deer God's coming after his head!

1014
01:59:47,707 --> 01:59:49,834
Touch that muck and you're dead!

1015
01:59:50,510 --> 01:59:53,104
Run into the lake!
The water'll slow it up!

1016
01:59:53,947 --> 01:59:57,508
The men and Lady Eboshi are coming
from the other side!

1017
01:59:57,584 --> 02:00:00,644
I'm going to give the head back!

1018
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:01,709
Hurry!

1019
02:00:02,222 --> 02:00:04,087
He's coming!

1020
02:00:04,157 --> 02:00:05,647
What do we do?!

1021
02:00:05,725 --> 02:00:06,783
Stay calm!

1022
02:00:07,294 --> 02:00:08,784
To the lake!

1023
02:00:08,995 --> 02:00:11,395
Stay calm! Help the injured!

1024
02:00:21,308 --> 02:00:23,105
Not that way!

1025
02:00:39,493 --> 02:00:41,256
There goes the roof...

1026
02:00:46,967 --> 02:00:50,596
Once the forge starts to burn,
it's all over.

1027
02:00:51,404 --> 02:00:54,896
As long as we're alive, we'll manage.
Move out deeper.

1028
02:01:13,059 --> 02:01:14,720
There they are!

1029
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:27,898
Go!

1030
02:01:28,875 --> 02:01:30,240
Wait!

1031
02:01:31,878 --> 02:01:34,005
You're still alive? Good!

1032
02:01:34,814 --> 02:01:37,544
I'll give the head back.
Put it down and run.

1033
02:01:37,651 --> 02:01:42,645
Give it back now? Don't be stupid.
The sun's coming up.

1034
02:01:42,722 --> 02:01:46,453
Look...a brainless, swollen
life-sucking god of death.

1035
02:01:46,526 --> 02:01:48,016
When the sun comes up, he'll vanish.

1036
02:01:48,562 --> 02:01:50,427
He's coming, Jiko. Quick!

1037
02:01:50,530 --> 02:01:55,399
Wanting all between heaven and hell
is the human condition.

1038
02:01:55,936 --> 02:01:57,267
I don't want to kill you...

1039
02:01:58,104 --> 02:01:59,765
Oh, dear...

1040
02:01:59,873 --> 02:02:02,501
Don't look so stern...

1041
02:02:09,182 --> 02:02:10,547
Run!

1042
02:02:29,869 --> 02:02:30,858
Ashitaka!

1043
02:02:39,045 --> 02:02:40,103
Uh-oh...

1044
02:02:42,949 --> 02:02:44,473
We're surrounded!

1045
02:02:45,485 --> 02:02:47,146
Come on, sun!

1046
02:02:47,220 --> 02:02:48,278
Open it!

1047
02:02:48,355 --> 02:02:50,380
Don't you understand? It's too late!

1048
02:02:51,024 --> 02:02:53,618
Don't waste time talking to him!

1049
02:02:53,693 --> 02:02:55,684
Human hands must return it!

1050
02:02:56,596 --> 02:02:59,429
Well, I warned you...

1051
02:03:14,247 --> 02:03:15,578
O Deer God...

1052
02:03:15,715 --> 02:03:17,580
We return your head!

1053
02:03:18,385 --> 02:03:20,376
Be at peace!

1054
02:03:31,131 --> 02:03:33,099
Here he comes!

1055
02:04:04,297 --> 02:04:05,594
He's stopped...

1056
02:04:05,665 --> 02:04:06,825
The men!

1057
02:04:19,913 --> 02:04:21,574
Milady!

1058
02:04:21,648 --> 02:04:23,309
Careful, she's hurt!

1059
02:04:52,479 --> 02:04:53,878
He's falling!

1060
02:05:00,086 --> 02:05:01,849
Hang on! Don't let go!

1061
02:06:08,922 --> 02:06:12,483
I didn't know the Deer God
made the flowers bloom...

1062
02:06:43,857 --> 02:06:45,757
San, look!

1063
02:07:16,243 --> 02:07:19,235
Even if they grow back,
they won't be the Deer God's woods.

1064
02:07:20,147 --> 02:07:21,842
The Deer God is dead.

1065
02:07:22,583 --> 02:07:26,110
The Deer God can't die.
He is life itself.

1066
02:07:26,187 --> 02:07:28,587
Life and death are his to give and take.

1067
02:07:29,323 --> 02:07:30,881
He's telling us we should live.

1068
02:07:39,533 --> 02:07:43,594
I like you, but I can't forgive
what people have done.

1069
02:07:43,671 --> 02:07:47,368
That's all right. You live in the
forest, and I'll live at the ironworks.

1070
02:07:48,209 --> 02:07:49,369
Together we'll live.

1071
02:07:50,177 --> 02:07:52,668
Yakul and I will visit you.

1072
02:08:04,525 --> 02:08:09,189
Can you believe it?
Saved thanks to a wolf!.

1073
02:08:09,830 --> 02:08:13,732
Someone bring Ashitaka.
I want to thank him.

1074
02:08:13,801 --> 02:08:17,828
We'll start over again.
We'll build a good village.

1075
02:08:18,539 --> 02:08:22,100
I give up...you can't win against fools!
