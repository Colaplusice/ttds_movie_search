00:03:49,953 --> 00:03:54,151
n''Where life had no value,
death, sometimes, had its price.

2
00:03:54,224 --> 00:03:58,684
That is why
the bounty killers appeared.''

3
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,471
Tickets.

4
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:16,936
Tickets, please.

5
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:25,716
Thank you. Tickets.

6
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:28,223
ls it far to Tucumcari?

7
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,384
We should pass there
in about three or four minutes.

8
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,791
Thanks.

9
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:35,194
Excuse me, but you've
made a mistake, Reverend.

10
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:37,756
l couldn't help hearing
you're going to Tucumcari.

11
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:40,997
l peddle goods around here, and l better
tell you you're on the wrong train.

12
00:04:45,308 --> 00:04:48,106
l think the nearest stop
to Tucumcari is Amarillo.

13
00:04:48,178 --> 00:04:51,443
By getting off at Sante Fe
and returning by way of Amarillo...

14
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:55,280
you should be able to get
right where you're going.

15
00:04:57,687 --> 00:05:01,851
You see, the train
doesn't stop at Tucumcari.

16
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:14,535
This train'll stop at Tucumcari.

17
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,063
Take it easy, everybody!

18
00:05:43,132 --> 00:05:45,396
Why'd you stop?
Something gone wrong?

19
00:05:45,468 --> 00:05:47,663
Somebody pulled the emergency cord.

20
00:05:58,047 --> 00:06:01,676
Hey, mister, you just can't pull
the emergency cord and jump off.

21
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:04,811
Why'd you stop that train?
lf you want to get off, you--

22
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:09,349
Well, the railroad company'd be mighty
pleased to make any arrangements...

23
00:06:09,425 --> 00:06:12,553
for any passenger if you want
to get off here, sir.

24
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:15,325
l did get off. Thanks.

25
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:21,132
All right, let's go!
Go ahead!

26
00:06:54,837 --> 00:06:58,603
Guy passed by here in person
and added on those two zeros.

27
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:02,304
He was spittin' mad when he saw what
they was offerin'. He wasn't flattered.

28
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:05,541
He said, ''A measly thousand bucks
for me is much too little.

29
00:07:05,615 --> 00:07:08,448
l'm worth a lot more than that.''

30
00:07:08,518 --> 00:07:11,510
He said that, and then he added
the zeros on the thousand.

31
00:07:13,356 --> 00:07:16,917
There isn't anyone got the guts
to face that killer, eh?

32
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,400
At least...

33
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:29,233
it's been that way till now.

34
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:10,841
Where is he?

35
00:08:26,362 --> 00:08:28,296
Where is he?

36
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,573
l have no idea
where he'd be today.

37
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,264
- Hold still.
- But Guy--

38
00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:06,233
- Hold still, l said.
- You hurt me with those hands of yours.

39
00:09:06,302 --> 00:09:09,066
- Then do as l tell ya.
- Stop it!

40
00:09:09,138 --> 00:09:12,005
Now see, you've made me drop the soap.

41
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:16,006
- Wait, l'll get it for ya.
- You're killing me.

42
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:20,983
Oh, look. What's that?

43
00:10:03,326 --> 00:10:05,886
Pardon me, ma'am.

44
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:38,416
l'll kill you for this.

45
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,794
There you are.
A thousand dollars.

46
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,474
What do you know about Cavanagh?

47
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:08,608
About a week ago
he was seen at White Rocks.

48
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:10,845
Thanks.

49
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,184
lf it's of any interest to ya...

50
00:12:13,256 --> 00:12:15,850
somebody else dropped in
to see me about him.

51
00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:18,121
Who?

52
00:12:18,194 --> 00:12:20,958
l'd never seen him before.

53
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,658
His name is Monco.

54
00:13:47,883 --> 00:13:49,817
Light?

55
00:13:51,988 --> 00:13:54,422
You know Baby Cavanagh?

56
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,222
Now tell me,
you know where l can find him?

57
00:14:07,236 --> 00:14:10,262
There, at that table.

58
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:12,273
He's got his back to ya.

59
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:17,912
Thanks.

60
00:15:23,245 --> 00:15:25,179
Two cards.

61
00:16:05,054 --> 00:16:07,181
Didn't hear what the bet was.

62
00:16:10,392 --> 00:16:11,882
Your life.

63
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,959
Alive or dead--
it's your choice.

64
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:49,397
Let Red go.

65
00:17:26,402 --> 00:17:29,269
Two thousand dollars.
lt's a lot of money.

66
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:31,602
Takes me three years to earn it.

67
00:17:31,674 --> 00:17:35,906
Tell me, isn't a sheriff
supposed to be courageous, loyal...

68
00:17:35,978 --> 00:17:37,912
and above all, honest?

69
00:17:38,914 --> 00:17:41,144
Yeah, that he is.

70
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:55,993
l think you people
need a new sheriff.

71
00:20:56,845 --> 00:20:58,904
Hughie.

72
00:21:35,017 --> 00:21:36,951
How are you, Nino?

73
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:38,953
Better when l see you.

74
00:21:52,134 --> 00:21:54,068
Go on. Go ahead.

75
00:22:16,124 --> 00:22:17,523
Open it.

76
00:22:36,445 --> 00:22:39,676
- What's up? Who is it?
- Rodriguez, senor.

77
00:23:11,747 --> 00:23:14,375
You. Come along.

78
00:23:29,631 --> 00:23:31,565
l'm letting you live, hero.

79
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:34,830
That's so you can tell everybody
you've seen what takes place here.

80
00:24:30,592 --> 00:24:32,526
For the lousy money.

81
00:24:40,769 --> 00:24:43,203
You took money
to put me behind bars.

82
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:48,175
You should've killed me
when you could.

83
00:24:49,011 --> 00:24:50,945
lt would be better for you.

84
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,271
And for them.

85
00:24:57,552 --> 00:24:59,713
How old's the boy?

86
00:25:03,325 --> 00:25:05,555
How old is the boy, l asked?

87
00:25:06,495 --> 00:25:08,190
He's 18 months now.

88
00:25:09,665 --> 00:25:12,498
Just the time that l was in jail.

89
00:25:15,203 --> 00:25:17,467
You used the reward that you got...

90
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:19,973
to start raising a family.

91
00:25:21,643 --> 00:25:23,873
And that's why l feel
your family is partly mine.

92
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:28,981
l'll take my part now.

93
00:25:29,051 --> 00:25:30,985
Outside.

94
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:38,448
They're both innocent. Please let them
go! l was the one. You know that.

95
00:26:06,788 --> 00:26:10,280
l know.
l'm sure you hate me just enough.

96
00:26:33,582 --> 00:26:36,142
This time you'll have a chance
to shoot me, but not in the back.

97
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:41,115
Let go.

98
00:26:47,596 --> 00:26:49,826
When you hear the music finish, begin.

99
00:26:51,533 --> 00:26:53,467
Or do you think you can?

100
00:26:56,972 --> 00:26:59,031
Let's start.

101
00:28:55,156 --> 00:28:57,124
Now.

102
00:29:35,897 --> 00:29:38,730
- Check those figures again.
- Yes, sir.

103
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,034
Good day, sir. Good afternoon.

104
00:29:44,105 --> 00:29:46,767
Mortimer.

105
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:49,901
- Douglas Mortimer.
- Mortimer. Virginia, isn't it?

106
00:29:49,978 --> 00:29:52,674
- Carolina.
- That's right, Carolina.

107
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:55,011
Can l help in some way?

108
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:59,042
- l'm looking for a first-class bank.
- Oh, but exactly.

109
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,587
Yeah.

110
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:04,056
The largest and most secure bank
in the territory.

111
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:06,923
Well, Mr. Mortimer,
l want to assure you our bank here...

112
00:30:06,995 --> 00:30:09,657
has everything--
all the safeguards you're looking for.

113
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:12,996
l don't doubt that, but l have
a large sum to deposit.

114
00:30:13,068 --> 00:30:15,195
Now, suppose l'm a bandit.

115
00:30:18,006 --> 00:30:19,974
A bandit?

116
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:23,033
A very dangerous bandit
with a gang of killers.

117
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:27,810
What would be the most
impossible bank for me to rob?

118
00:30:27,882 --> 00:30:31,545
ln your case, the one bank
l would suggest is the Bank of El Paso.

119
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:33,746
Not even lndio would dare
to attack that one.

120
00:30:33,822 --> 00:30:36,416
lt's not a bank.
lt's a fortress there.

121
00:30:41,463 --> 00:30:43,863
What time's the next train
for El Paso?

122
00:30:43,932 --> 00:30:46,366
11:30. l'll telegraph
to my colleague...

123
00:30:46,434 --> 00:30:48,732
in the Bank of El Paso
that you're going to arrive.

124
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:50,862
Thanks.

125
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,626
Hey, mister. Captain.
General. Welcome.

126
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,033
Do you need a stable or a room?
Do you want to take a bath?

127
00:31:22,103 --> 00:31:24,867
My name is Fernando.
The stable is right here.

128
00:31:24,939 --> 00:31:26,736
And that is your hotel.

129
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:30,403
Why this hotel
and not some other?

130
00:31:30,478 --> 00:31:33,140
You probably wouldn't like
that other place as much, senor.

131
00:31:33,214 --> 00:31:36,445
You'd have to spend half the night
shootin' cockroaches.

132
00:31:36,518 --> 00:31:38,918
At this hotel, the rooms
will cost you so much less.

133
00:31:38,987 --> 00:31:40,978
And there's a landlady
at this one, senor.

134
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,922
- Married?
- Yes, but she doesn't care.

135
00:32:03,912 --> 00:32:07,211
That's the bank. As soon as l get
some money, l'll put it in.

136
00:32:07,282 --> 00:32:09,580
Well, you're gonna have
to earn it first.

137
00:32:11,486 --> 00:32:13,954
l have 50 cents here for you
if you'll let me know...

138
00:32:14,022 --> 00:32:18,516
when anybody you've never seen before
here in El Paso comes to town.

139
00:32:18,593 --> 00:32:21,790
At the hotel, senor.
A stranger just came outta there.

140
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,904
Where's he staying?

141
00:32:39,948 --> 00:32:41,882
The hotel.

142
00:32:45,587 --> 00:32:48,249
Let me know if you see
any more strangers.

143
00:32:48,323 --> 00:32:50,553
Sure, senor.

144
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:09,072
- Help you, sir?
- l want the room right above.

145
00:33:09,144 --> 00:33:12,477
l'm sorry, it's occupied.
lt's too bad.

146
00:33:12,547 --> 00:33:15,414
The hotel's filled to capacity.
l'm sorry.

147
00:33:15,483 --> 00:33:18,509
The room you want is our best.
lt's always occupied.

148
00:33:18,586 --> 00:33:19,780
By who?

149
00:33:20,822 --> 00:33:22,551
Check the register.

150
00:33:22,624 --> 00:33:24,216
Mary!

151
00:33:25,894 --> 00:33:28,124
lt's Senor Martinez.

152
00:33:36,738 --> 00:33:39,969
- lt's free now.
- That room is taken!

153
00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:43,243
l'll see to it.

154
00:33:48,449 --> 00:33:51,680
He's nothing but a wild,
vicious animal!

155
00:33:51,753 --> 00:33:53,687
He's tall, isn't he?

156
00:33:57,792 --> 00:33:59,726
You're just dirty!

157
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,770
Proprietor, quick! My bill!

158
00:34:14,842 --> 00:34:16,776
l want my bill!

159
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:22,073
- Before he comes down, give me my bill.
- There's no need to check out.

160
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:25,347
Everything's gonna be all right.
l'll give you another room immediately.

161
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,685
lt's the best in the whole hotel.
We'll let him have the bridal suite.

162
00:34:28,756 --> 00:34:31,122
No, Mary, the bill.
l'd like to stay, only l can't.

163
00:34:31,192 --> 00:34:33,922
- Don't go, Mr. Martinez.
- l have an appointment elsewhere.

164
00:34:38,233 --> 00:34:40,360
Yes, senor, what do you want?

165
00:34:46,307 --> 00:34:48,241
l don't wear 'em.

166
00:34:48,309 --> 00:34:50,470
l'm honored that you thought of me.
Thank you.

167
00:35:30,218 --> 00:35:32,846
Watch this.

168
00:35:56,678 --> 00:35:58,612
Hello, my friends.

169
00:35:59,881 --> 00:36:01,678
Hello, lndio.

170
00:36:01,749 --> 00:36:04,718
You see, l didn't waste
a minute coming here.

171
00:36:04,786 --> 00:36:07,687
lndio calls and Groggy
comes running right away.

172
00:36:07,755 --> 00:36:09,245
And Sancho?

173
00:36:09,324 --> 00:36:13,158
lf you're waiting for Sancho, l'll go
and come back in about four years.

174
00:36:13,227 --> 00:36:16,594
He's in prison for four years.

175
00:36:23,237 --> 00:36:26,798
Bad for him.
Not so bad for the rest of us.

176
00:36:26,874 --> 00:36:29,843
A man who gets caught
doesn't deserve respect, huh?

177
00:36:32,313 --> 00:36:34,508
What's it all about, huh?

178
00:36:34,582 --> 00:36:36,140
Now just listen.

179
00:36:40,521 --> 00:36:42,113
A bank at El Paso.

180
00:36:43,991 --> 00:36:45,390
Let's see.

181
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:50,488
We'll say this is the inside
of the bank. Nino is the safe.

182
00:36:50,565 --> 00:36:53,557
Which weighs three tons
and can't be opened with dynamite.

183
00:36:55,203 --> 00:36:57,137
There's the part with two cashiers.

184
00:36:58,439 --> 00:37:01,067
This is the manager's desk.

185
00:37:01,142 --> 00:37:03,940
Right in back is a fancy cabinet
containing bottles...

186
00:37:04,011 --> 00:37:06,605
for offering drinks
to the rich depositors.

187
00:37:08,516 --> 00:37:12,612
There's the main door, and opposite
they built a double wall.

188
00:37:12,687 --> 00:37:14,655
What happens, Groggy?

189
00:37:14,722 --> 00:37:18,715
Let's say you've already killed
the two cashiers and the manager.

190
00:37:18,793 --> 00:37:22,729
For the next few minutes,
you're the boss of the bank.

191
00:37:22,797 --> 00:37:24,731
Now what?

192
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:28,065
The time's been wasted.

193
00:37:29,637 --> 00:37:33,368
Right, a waste of time.
Especially, Groggy, to blast open...

194
00:37:33,441 --> 00:37:37,172
that damn iron safe, we'd have
to be using so much dynamite...

195
00:37:37,245 --> 00:37:40,180
that the whole bank
would just disappear.

196
00:37:40,248 --> 00:37:43,240
And you'd all go up with it.

197
00:37:43,317 --> 00:37:48,050
Besides, the presence of a safe alone
doesn't always signify...

198
00:37:48,122 --> 00:37:49,953
that there is money inside.

199
00:37:51,626 --> 00:37:53,560
To help you understand what l mean...

200
00:37:55,897 --> 00:38:00,334
l would like to relate
a nice little parable.

201
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,734
Once upon a time
there was a carpenter.

202
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:10,204
You don't think a carpenter
can make money, eh?

203
00:38:11,279 --> 00:38:13,713
No? You're wrong.

204
00:38:14,816 --> 00:38:19,583
This one did well because
he was a builder of safes.

205
00:38:20,788 --> 00:38:22,983
There was a banker once...

206
00:38:23,057 --> 00:38:25,685
who decided he must have
his iron safe disguised...

207
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,287
to look like a wood cabinet.

208
00:38:32,467 --> 00:38:34,401
To get it made...

209
00:38:34,469 --> 00:38:39,065
the banker goes to our carpenter
for the job, and one day...

210
00:38:40,174 --> 00:38:42,301
as destiny has it...

211
00:38:42,376 --> 00:38:44,936
the carpenter's in El Paso.

212
00:38:45,012 --> 00:38:48,209
He happens to walk into the bank there,
and what does he find?

213
00:38:49,217 --> 00:38:50,411
The cabinet.

214
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:54,545
Since he'd worked on the cabinet,
he spotted it right away.

215
00:38:55,389 --> 00:38:58,222
From that day on,
he couldn't work anymore.

216
00:38:58,292 --> 00:39:01,318
Pity, because...

217
00:39:01,395 --> 00:39:04,228
there was something he had to do.

218
00:39:04,298 --> 00:39:07,096
There was this crazy idea.

219
00:39:07,168 --> 00:39:09,102
And it stayed--

220
00:39:13,207 --> 00:39:15,971
to put his hands on the money inside.

221
00:39:16,043 --> 00:39:17,977
Get in there and grab all the money.

222
00:39:19,714 --> 00:39:23,616
Sure, you think that carpenter
was lucky the way things work out--

223
00:39:23,684 --> 00:39:26,084
that he was lucky
to go in just that bank.

224
00:39:26,153 --> 00:39:28,087
lt wasn't true.

225
00:39:30,124 --> 00:39:32,319
His good fortune stopped that day.

226
00:39:32,393 --> 00:39:34,759
Because later...

227
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:36,763
as a prisoner...

228
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,434
he ran into me.

229
00:39:46,407 --> 00:39:49,865
The carpenter told me the story,
and l tell you.

230
00:39:56,317 --> 00:39:58,615
The money isn't in the safe.
lt's right in this!

231
00:40:02,223 --> 00:40:04,783
Almost a million dollars in it.

232
00:40:07,595 --> 00:40:10,155
Your colleague in Tucumcari told me
that this bank...

233
00:40:10,231 --> 00:40:13,394
has the largest deposits
in the whole state.

234
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:15,594
Yes, that's correct,
Mr. Mortimer.

235
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:19,868
Here at the bank at El Paso we have half
a million dollars in reserve on hand.

236
00:40:22,877 --> 00:40:26,745
l see. You sure this bank
is secure enough to hold that much?

237
00:40:26,814 --> 00:40:29,647
From the moment your money's
on deposit here...

238
00:40:29,717 --> 00:40:31,651
you can sleep without any worries.

239
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:37,155
Besides...

240
00:40:37,224 --> 00:40:39,954
when the bank is closed,
an armed guard always remains here...

241
00:40:40,027 --> 00:40:42,655
and a patrol
is on guard outside.

242
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:46,723
Even the Bank of San Francisco
isn't that well protected.

243
00:40:46,801 --> 00:40:50,464
Exactly. The truth is...

244
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:53,798
to try robbing us
would be so futile...

245
00:40:53,874 --> 00:40:57,275
that only a complete fool
would attempt it.

246
00:40:57,345 --> 00:40:59,438
Yeah.

247
00:40:59,513 --> 00:41:01,572
Or a complete madman.

248
00:41:12,293 --> 00:41:14,454
Get out of the way!
Get out of here!

249
00:42:00,408 --> 00:42:02,342
More news, amigo.

250
00:42:04,612 --> 00:42:07,342
Another stranger in town?

251
00:42:07,415 --> 00:42:10,043
Yes. And l know something else.

252
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:19,351
There was another stranger
l didn't tell you about.

253
00:42:19,427 --> 00:42:22,396
Listen to me,
you sawed-off little runt!

254
00:42:22,463 --> 00:42:24,954
l want to know how many men
there are all together.

255
00:42:25,032 --> 00:42:27,398
Well, there were two.
Now there's two more.

256
00:42:27,468 --> 00:42:29,868
Where?

257
00:42:29,937 --> 00:42:32,303
ln the saloon.

258
00:44:42,169 --> 00:44:43,500
Whiskey.

259
00:44:43,571 --> 00:44:46,768
Listen, mister, why do you choose
my place to commit suicide?

260
00:44:46,841 --> 00:44:50,242
l know that man.
lt's a miracle you're alive.

261
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:53,940
Why should a man walk around with
a pistol and let himself be insulted?

262
00:44:54,014 --> 00:44:55,948
lt's mighty strange.

263
00:44:56,016 --> 00:44:57,984
lf the hunchback didn't shoot you...

264
00:44:58,052 --> 00:45:01,544
he had a very important reason,
that's all.

265
00:45:03,224 --> 00:45:05,192
l was thinking that myself.

266
00:46:05,252 --> 00:46:07,846
1, 2...

267
00:46:07,922 --> 00:46:12,154
3, now 4, now 5...

268
00:46:20,367 --> 00:46:23,734
11, 12, 13...

269
00:46:23,804 --> 00:46:27,262
14, 15, 16...

270
00:46:27,341 --> 00:46:31,744
17, 18, 19...

271
00:46:31,812 --> 00:46:36,010
20, 21, 22...

272
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:39,143
23, 24...

273
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:42,017
25, 26...

274
00:46:42,089 --> 00:46:47,152
27, 28, 29...

275
00:46:47,227 --> 00:46:50,094
30, 31...

276
00:46:50,164 --> 00:46:53,497
32 and 33.

277
00:48:38,572 --> 00:48:40,506
All right, now.

278
00:48:42,042 --> 00:48:44,738
l don't know him!

279
00:48:44,812 --> 00:48:46,746
Come on, now, you know everybody.

280
00:48:46,814 --> 00:48:50,614
l don't know anybody anymore!
l'm dead! Understand?

281
00:48:50,684 --> 00:48:53,152
Well, there was a time
when l knew everybody.

282
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,053
That was a long time ago
when all this was prairie.

283
00:48:56,123 --> 00:48:58,523
ln these days everybody's in a hurry.
That's right...

284
00:48:58,592 --> 00:49:01,186
with your damned
good-for-nothing trains!

285
00:49:04,565 --> 00:49:06,055
Disgusting!

286
00:49:06,133 --> 00:49:08,465
One day, someone from the railroad
comes here to see me.

287
00:49:08,535 --> 00:49:12,198
He says, ''Prophet, the railway's
gonna go right past your house.''

288
00:49:12,272 --> 00:49:15,207
''ls that so?'' l said.

289
00:49:15,275 --> 00:49:17,641
''Yep, that right,'' he says.

290
00:49:17,711 --> 00:49:19,941
''All those trains
gonna go right past here.

291
00:49:20,013 --> 00:49:22,345
The best thing for you, Prophet,
is sell your land to the company...

292
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:24,145
or else we'll buy Baker's.

293
00:49:24,218 --> 00:49:26,982
He lives next to your place,
and l'll put the tracks here...

294
00:49:27,054 --> 00:49:29,147
and that'll make you go crazy.

295
00:49:29,223 --> 00:49:31,418
Will you sell out
to our company, Prophet?''

296
00:49:31,492 --> 00:49:33,960
''Oh, is that so?'' says l.

297
00:49:35,796 --> 00:49:38,230
He was very anxious
for me to sell out.

298
00:49:38,298 --> 00:49:40,562
You know what l told him
about the railroad?

299
00:49:40,634 --> 00:49:43,501
You know what l told him
he could do with his railroad?

300
00:50:02,556 --> 00:50:05,252
You know what my decision
about selling was?

301
00:50:05,325 --> 00:50:07,259
Well, you said no.

302
00:50:07,327 --> 00:50:10,728
You're right about that.
No to him and his damn trains!

303
00:50:10,797 --> 00:50:12,731
l wouldn't! No!

304
00:50:12,799 --> 00:50:15,734
Look, listen to me, old man.

305
00:50:15,802 --> 00:50:17,736
You're supposed to be a prophet.

306
00:50:17,804 --> 00:50:20,637
l didn't come here to listen to you
rattle on about trains.

307
00:50:20,707 --> 00:50:24,108
l want to find out about this man.
lt's obvious you don't know anything.

308
00:50:24,178 --> 00:50:26,942
No need to be insulting.
lf that's all you came here to do...

309
00:50:27,014 --> 00:50:29,983
you can clear out of my house fast
before l lose my temper.

310
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:31,984
Understand?

311
00:50:35,756 --> 00:50:37,951
Hey! Where you goin'?

312
00:50:40,961 --> 00:50:43,759
l guess l better leave before
you go and lose your temper.

313
00:50:44,831 --> 00:50:47,163
What's the matter with you?
Why are you so dang stupid?

314
00:50:47,234 --> 00:50:49,168
Hurry up,
give me that pistol there.

315
00:50:49,236 --> 00:50:51,670
Yeah, right there behind ya.

316
00:50:51,738 --> 00:50:53,672
Hurry!

317
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:57,141
Yes, that's the one.
Now, hand it over.

318
00:50:57,211 --> 00:51:00,874
That's it. Give me that gun.
The man you asked about.

319
00:51:00,948 --> 00:51:03,940
There's only one question:
How does he carry his gun?

320
00:51:04,017 --> 00:51:06,212
He wears it here,
across his belly?

321
00:51:06,286 --> 00:51:09,744
Well, why didn't you tell me that
in the first place, my boy.

322
00:51:09,823 --> 00:51:12,291
Of course l know the man
you're trying to find out about.

323
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:14,293
Of course l know him.

324
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:17,194
He's Colonel Douglas Mortimer.

325
00:51:17,264 --> 00:51:20,165
Mortimer-- a brave man, a soldier.

326
00:51:21,001 --> 00:51:23,492
He was known as the best shot
in the Carolinas.

327
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,197
A great soldier.

328
00:51:25,272 --> 00:51:29,174
Now he's reduced to being
a bounty killer, same as you.

329
00:51:29,243 --> 00:51:31,006
Because of trains!

330
00:51:31,078 --> 00:51:34,377
Because of the damn trains!
Damn 'em!

331
00:53:00,801 --> 00:53:04,737
Take it to the station.
The gentleman's leavin'.

332
00:53:09,376 --> 00:53:11,139
Hold it.

333
00:53:13,113 --> 00:53:14,580
Take it back.

334
00:53:17,851 --> 00:53:19,944
Take it to the station.

335
00:53:22,022 --> 00:53:24,923
- Go inside.
- The station!

336
00:54:33,927 --> 00:54:36,122
Just like the games we know.

337
00:55:31,751 --> 00:55:34,015
- He's picking it up.
- A trick, maybe.

338
00:57:19,792 --> 00:57:24,195
How can somebody in my business
go around with a contraption like this?

339
00:57:25,298 --> 00:57:27,232
That contraption...

340
00:57:28,501 --> 00:57:30,696
almost sent you to your grave.

341
00:57:32,705 --> 00:57:35,902
You're forgetting one thing, Colonel--
l was shooting at your hat.

342
00:57:35,975 --> 00:57:38,205
Well, l was only shooting at yours.

343
00:57:39,278 --> 00:57:41,542
But l recall firing first.

344
00:57:43,549 --> 00:57:45,380
Boy...

345
00:57:45,451 --> 00:57:48,648
l've reached almost 50 years
of age with my system.

346
00:57:48,721 --> 00:57:51,053
Not many men last long
in these parts.

347
00:57:51,124 --> 00:57:53,388
How long do you expect to last?

348
00:57:55,128 --> 00:57:56,720
Much longer than that.

349
00:57:57,797 --> 00:58:01,631
When l get my hands on lndio
and that $10,000...

350
00:58:01,701 --> 00:58:05,068
l'm gonna buy myself a little place,
possibly retire.

351
00:58:06,673 --> 00:58:09,608
Well, l don't believe we ought
to start another fight.

352
00:58:09,676 --> 00:58:11,735
But you forget one small detail.

353
00:58:11,811 --> 00:58:13,335
What's that?

354
00:58:13,413 --> 00:58:15,677
l wanna get my hands on lndio too.

355
00:58:15,748 --> 00:58:18,182
Sure, after me.

356
00:58:19,852 --> 00:58:22,116
Or before you.

357
00:58:22,188 --> 00:58:24,122
Or at the same time.

358
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:28,921
ls that a proposition?

359
00:58:30,329 --> 00:58:31,887
An equal partnership.

360
00:58:32,965 --> 00:58:34,830
Why? Why should l?

361
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:36,835
l can think of three reasons.

362
00:58:36,903 --> 00:58:39,064
First is there's 14 of them.

363
00:58:39,138 --> 00:58:41,038
Yeah, that's a lot.

364
00:58:41,107 --> 00:58:42,665
A lot for me.

365
00:58:42,742 --> 00:58:45,267
Yeah. No small number
even for two of us.

366
00:58:45,344 --> 00:58:46,936
Second reason?

367
00:58:48,214 --> 00:58:50,273
Second reason--

368
00:58:52,819 --> 00:58:55,447
The second reason is
you could make it 15 to one.

369
00:58:55,521 --> 00:58:57,989
Don't forget l wanna play
in this game too.

370
00:58:58,057 --> 00:59:02,460
As you're aware, when two hunters
go after the same prey...

371
00:59:02,528 --> 00:59:05,964
they usually end up shooting each other
in the back, and we don't want that.

372
00:59:10,336 --> 00:59:12,497
Then the colonel dies, hmm?

373
00:59:14,841 --> 00:59:16,741
All right, l'll be generous.

374
00:59:18,444 --> 00:59:21,072
You can have the reward
for lndio...

375
00:59:21,147 --> 00:59:23,342
and l'll take the reward
for the rest of the band.

376
00:59:26,686 --> 00:59:28,745
All wrong.

377
00:59:28,821 --> 00:59:33,315
lndio's worth $10,000 dollars, but
the rest adds up to much more than that.

378
00:59:33,392 --> 00:59:36,953
Blackie's worth four,
Wild's worth three, Nino two.

379
00:59:37,029 --> 00:59:38,690
Nino's one.

380
00:59:41,367 --> 00:59:43,767
Well, Frisco's worth two.

381
00:59:43,836 --> 00:59:46,327
That's ten thousand.

382
00:59:46,405 --> 00:59:48,305
Yeah, but...

383
00:59:48,374 --> 00:59:51,571
there's a few more that'll
add up to more than that, l'm sure.

384
00:59:51,644 --> 00:59:54,909
- How do you know that?
- l have my information.

385
00:59:54,981 --> 00:59:56,915
When all's said and done...

386
00:59:56,983 --> 01:00:00,043
l think l might just take you up
on your proposition.

387
01:00:03,256 --> 01:00:05,554
Let's drink to this partnership.

388
01:00:09,295 --> 01:00:12,560
To the partnership,
with no tricks, of course.

389
01:00:13,699 --> 01:00:15,394
No tricks.

390
01:00:19,405 --> 01:00:20,804
Now, then...

391
01:00:20,873 --> 01:00:25,276
you realize we're gonna have to figure
out some way to get them in the middle.

392
01:00:28,247 --> 01:00:32,183
One from the outside, one from
the inside. There's no other way.

393
01:00:32,251 --> 01:00:35,687
One of us will have to
join lndio's band.

394
01:00:37,857 --> 01:00:40,382
Why are you looking at me
when you say ''one of us''?

395
01:00:40,459 --> 01:00:42,120
Because they don't know you.

396
01:00:42,195 --> 01:00:45,062
Wild sees me and his hump
will catch on fire.

397
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:49,225
Tell me...

398
01:00:49,302 --> 01:00:52,465
how do you propose that l
join up with lndio?

399
01:00:52,538 --> 01:00:55,507
Maybe bring him
a bunch of roses?

400
01:00:55,575 --> 01:01:00,012
You could do that, but l'd suggest
you take him Sancho Perez.

401
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:02,377
Who's Sancho Perez?

402
01:01:02,448 --> 01:01:05,383
A friend of lndio's.
Right now he's cooling off.

403
01:01:05,451 --> 01:01:08,079
He's cooling off
in Alamogourdo jail.

404
01:01:08,154 --> 01:01:10,714
How do you know all this?

405
01:01:11,924 --> 01:01:14,222
l've got my information too.

406
01:01:16,295 --> 01:01:20,322
Naturally, you'll have to arrange
for his, uh, release.

407
01:01:23,069 --> 01:01:24,502
Naturally.

408
01:01:26,372 --> 01:01:28,340
Tell me...

409
01:01:28,407 --> 01:01:30,875
were you ever young?

410
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,675
And just as reckless as you.

411
01:01:40,086 --> 01:01:43,021
Then one day something happened.

412
01:01:43,089 --> 01:01:44,852
Made life very precious to me.

413
01:01:44,924 --> 01:01:46,516
What's that?

414
01:01:52,498 --> 01:01:54,898
Or is the question indiscreet?

415
01:01:57,904 --> 01:02:00,031
The question isn't indiscreet.

416
01:02:01,374 --> 01:02:03,365
But the answer could be.

417
01:05:17,703 --> 01:05:21,833
They told me you were put away. You'd be
resting for four long years in prison.

418
01:05:24,543 --> 01:05:28,479
No, lndio, for four weeks.
No more than four weeks.

419
01:05:40,126 --> 01:05:41,957
Who is that with you?

420
01:05:42,027 --> 01:05:45,155
He got me out.
The man's a friend of mine.

421
01:05:52,705 --> 01:05:55,674
Why did he help you?
Did you ask him that?

422
01:05:57,276 --> 01:06:00,677
Yeah. Amigo, why did you
help me out?

423
01:06:02,648 --> 01:06:07,779
Well, there's such a big reward
being offered on all you gentlemen...

424
01:06:07,853 --> 01:06:11,016
that l thought l might just tag along
on your next robbery.

425
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:14,225
l might just turn you
into the law.

426
01:06:57,069 --> 01:06:58,661
Amigo...

427
01:07:00,306 --> 01:07:03,503
that's the one answer
that would prove you're all right.

428
01:07:05,711 --> 01:07:09,169
And you arrived just in time too.
The job is already set.

429
01:07:10,249 --> 01:07:11,807
lt's tomorrow.

430
01:07:12,918 --> 01:07:15,011
The place is...

431
01:07:15,087 --> 01:07:17,521
the bank in El Paso.

432
01:07:19,858 --> 01:07:23,021
Not far from El Paso
there's a little town, Santa Cruz.

433
01:07:23,095 --> 01:07:26,587
Tomorrow, Blackie, Chico,
Paco...

434
01:07:26,665 --> 01:07:29,828
and you, amigo...

435
01:07:29,902 --> 01:07:32,496
will rob the bank in Santa Cruz.

436
01:07:32,571 --> 01:07:35,734
Shoot, kill, get every gun
in the area after you...

437
01:07:35,808 --> 01:07:37,742
especially those from El Paso.

438
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:41,211
Any others around,
we'll take care of them.

439
01:07:43,048 --> 01:07:46,017
And then after the job,
we'll all meet again at Las Palmeras.

440
01:07:50,489 --> 01:07:52,719
Where are you going?

441
01:07:58,764 --> 01:08:01,562
Well, if there's gonna be
any shooting...

442
01:08:02,635 --> 01:08:04,569
l gotta get my rest.

443
01:08:21,687 --> 01:08:26,317
Hey, amigo, you know when you told
that story yesterday, l fell for it.

444
01:08:26,392 --> 01:08:28,724
Big joke, wasn't it, amigo?

445
01:08:38,037 --> 01:08:39,868
Who said l was jokin'?

446
01:08:42,141 --> 01:08:44,109
l don't get that.
lf it's true--

447
01:08:44,176 --> 01:08:46,610
Too bad you have to die.

448
01:08:50,783 --> 01:08:52,250
What is it?

449
01:09:48,107 --> 01:09:51,042
By now they should be
at Santa Cruz.

450
01:10:33,385 --> 01:10:34,909
Listen, shorty...

451
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:42,290
lndio and his band have just
robbed the bank here in town.

452
01:10:42,361 --> 01:10:45,819
Now why don't you just sit down
and send out the alarm to El Paso...

453
01:10:45,898 --> 01:10:48,765
and the rest of the towns around here
and warn 'em, right?

454
01:10:48,834 --> 01:10:52,497
But, mister, l didn't hear any shots
at the bank, and l sure would have.

455
01:10:52,571 --> 01:10:54,505
You might hear one.

456
01:10:54,573 --> 01:10:56,200
The alarm.

457
01:11:39,718 --> 01:11:41,743
Easy now.

458
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:44,516
They've robbed the bank
at Santa Cruz!

459
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:47,853
Follow me!

460
01:13:26,124 --> 01:13:28,922
Groggy, the telegraph wires.

461
01:15:22,641 --> 01:15:24,802
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Good day, sir.

462
01:15:27,813 --> 01:15:30,145
- Sir.
- Good afternoon.

463
01:17:20,225 --> 01:17:21,920
The other side.

464
01:18:05,904 --> 01:18:07,804
Eleven...

465
01:18:07,873 --> 01:18:09,238
twelve...

466
01:18:12,244 --> 01:18:14,041
Fourteen...

467
01:20:55,407 --> 01:20:57,068
Let's go!

468
01:22:20,325 --> 01:22:23,624
What are you doin' here?
You're not runnin' away, are you?

469
01:22:23,695 --> 01:22:25,424
No, l'm not running away.

470
01:22:25,497 --> 01:22:29,160
l'm going after them and l'm going
alone. Our partnership is dissolved.

471
01:22:29,234 --> 01:22:31,065
Boy, let's wait
and talk it over.

472
01:22:31,136 --> 01:22:35,266
All we've done is talk.
l've been reasonable with no results.

473
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:38,639
Now take it easy. We only knew
the Santa Cruz part of this plan.

474
01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:41,838
You were the one who had
their strategy all worked out.

475
01:22:41,913 --> 01:22:44,541
- Now l'm gonna meet lndio.
- l see. l better go along.

476
01:22:45,617 --> 01:22:47,551
l'm going alone-- Me.

477
01:22:47,619 --> 01:22:51,020
l have an appointment with lndio
and l'm not gonna let anyone interfere.

478
01:22:51,089 --> 01:22:54,081
- You certain about that?
- That's right.

479
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:56,627
ln that case l'm sorry.

480
01:23:00,498 --> 01:23:05,197
That's not bad. lndio sent
four men to Santa Cruz.

481
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:08,467
And one man returns--
a new man without a scratch.

482
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:10,701
Mm-mm. lndio's no idiot.

483
01:23:10,775 --> 01:23:14,233
When you ride up to him and show him
that little nick, he might believe you.

484
01:23:15,313 --> 01:23:17,406
And don't forget,
that as of today...

485
01:23:17,482 --> 01:23:20,110
the whole gang's worth
$40,000 more.

486
01:23:20,185 --> 01:23:23,211
That's the reward offered by the bank
to get the money back.

487
01:23:23,288 --> 01:23:27,088
- ls the partnership operating again?
- Just how do you figure?

488
01:23:27,158 --> 01:23:32,061
Try to convince lndio to go north,
and then go along the Rio Bravo.

489
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:35,327
lt's a good spot for an ambush
and we can get him between two fires.

490
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:39,200
You on the outside,
me on the inside, right?

491
01:23:40,572 --> 01:23:41,903
North?

492
01:23:46,144 --> 01:23:47,634
North.

493
01:24:06,798 --> 01:24:08,527
Hughie.

494
01:24:16,374 --> 01:24:20,834
Wait a minute. We need time to open it
and this isn't the right place.

495
01:24:50,408 --> 01:24:52,000
And the others?

496
01:24:52,076 --> 01:24:53,543
Dead?

497
01:24:54,746 --> 01:24:59,240
After Santa Cruz, we headed for El Paso
and they hit us from all sides.

498
01:25:00,718 --> 01:25:04,051
And you just saved your own skin,
isn't that right, you yellow--

499
01:25:23,608 --> 01:25:26,907
You did your part of it.
Let's go.

500
01:25:26,978 --> 01:25:28,605
Which way we headed?

501
01:25:29,681 --> 01:25:31,046
North.

502
01:25:31,115 --> 01:25:34,312
North? Along Rio Bravo canyon?

503
01:25:34,385 --> 01:25:35,977
Why not?

504
01:25:37,355 --> 01:25:39,823
Seems like a good place
for an ambush to me.

505
01:25:41,926 --> 01:25:43,860
You know a better way to go?

506
01:25:43,928 --> 01:25:45,862
Yeah, south.

507
01:25:47,932 --> 01:25:49,559
Ride to the border?

508
01:25:49,634 --> 01:25:53,661
They'll never expect you to cross the
border now that the alarm's been sent.

509
01:26:00,144 --> 01:26:02,374
Think we'll head east.

510
01:26:02,447 --> 01:26:05,780
There's a place l know about,
Agua Caliente.

511
01:26:06,851 --> 01:26:09,843
Here we are.
That's Agua Caliente.

512
01:26:10,922 --> 01:26:13,755
Yes, l have many friends here.

513
01:26:13,825 --> 01:26:15,759
lt looks just like a morgue.

514
01:26:16,928 --> 01:26:18,953
But look out.

515
01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:21,157
lt could be one so easily.

516
01:26:22,433 --> 01:26:25,834
- They don't like strangers.
- No, they don't like anybody.

517
01:26:27,705 --> 01:26:31,641
Wild, you never saw
our friend here shoot, right?

518
01:26:35,747 --> 01:26:37,476
Did any of you?

519
01:26:40,485 --> 01:26:43,147
We don't know how you'd be
in emergencies.

520
01:26:44,255 --> 01:26:46,815
l was thinking,
this is the right place.

521
01:26:46,891 --> 01:26:49,155
l got a way
you can show the men.

522
01:26:51,562 --> 01:26:53,086
How's that?

523
01:26:54,565 --> 01:26:56,328
Go into town alone, amigo.

524
01:29:42,967 --> 01:29:44,093
Bravo.

525
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:37,483
Do you mind tellin' me
how you got here?

526
01:30:37,555 --> 01:30:40,115
l just reasoned it out.

527
01:30:40,191 --> 01:30:42,386
l figured you'd tell lndio...

528
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:45,918
to do just exactly the opposite
of what we agreed...

529
01:30:45,997 --> 01:30:48,864
and he's suspicious enough
to figure out somethin' else.

530
01:30:50,101 --> 01:30:53,696
Since El Paso was out of the question,
well, here l am.

531
01:30:56,007 --> 01:30:57,872
Rum-- a double.

532
01:30:58,943 --> 01:31:00,877
Tequila for all of us.

533
01:31:17,628 --> 01:31:20,358
lf it isn't the smoker.

534
01:31:31,509 --> 01:31:33,841
Remember me, amigo?

535
01:31:36,013 --> 01:31:39,176
Of course you do. El Paso.

536
01:31:42,253 --> 01:31:44,721
lt's a small world.

537
01:31:44,789 --> 01:31:47,519
Yes, and very, very bad.

538
01:31:48,626 --> 01:31:51,789
Now, come on.
You light another match.

539
01:31:53,564 --> 01:31:57,864
l generally smoke just after l eat.
Come back in ten minutes.

540
01:31:57,935 --> 01:32:01,837
Ten minutes you'll be smoking
in hell. Get up!

541
01:32:01,906 --> 01:32:03,271
Stay calm.

542
01:32:05,576 --> 01:32:07,510
On your feet.

543
01:32:15,219 --> 01:32:16,880
Cucillo.

544
01:32:18,055 --> 01:32:19,545
Count to three.

545
01:32:29,467 --> 01:32:31,332
One...

546
01:32:33,170 --> 01:32:34,831
two...

547
01:32:36,474 --> 01:32:38,066
three!

548
01:32:41,812 --> 01:32:43,507
Stop it!

549
01:33:05,803 --> 01:33:07,498
Who are you?

550
01:33:09,073 --> 01:33:11,007
l'm the one who can open
the safe for you.

551
01:33:15,813 --> 01:33:17,212
What safe, senor?

552
01:33:17,281 --> 01:33:20,717
The one from El Paso.
You got there ahead of me.

553
01:33:20,785 --> 01:33:22,719
- However--
- However?

554
01:33:24,622 --> 01:33:28,388
Open that safe and you're gonna
destroy half the bank notes.

555
01:33:28,459 --> 01:33:30,984
l can open it
without blowing it up.

556
01:33:39,403 --> 01:33:40,870
What'll it cost?

557
01:33:40,938 --> 01:33:42,428
Five thousand.

558
01:33:46,076 --> 01:33:48,010
Two's all l'll pay you.

559
01:33:49,146 --> 01:33:50,841
Five.

560
01:34:28,018 --> 01:34:29,952
Keep your hands off it!

561
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:33,478
lt's easy to steal.
The trouble is in keeping the loot.

562
01:34:33,557 --> 01:34:35,821
Take it out.

563
01:34:35,893 --> 01:34:38,191
Now every man in New Mexico
is after us.

564
01:34:38,262 --> 01:34:41,925
lf they catch one of us with money
we'll all end up the same way.

565
01:34:41,999 --> 01:34:45,901
We're going to wait here for an
entire month if l think it's necessary.

566
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:48,939
Then everybody will get his share.

567
01:34:49,006 --> 01:34:51,372
And you will wait a month
to get your money.

568
01:34:52,710 --> 01:34:54,337
Naturally.

569
01:34:54,411 --> 01:34:56,777
l'll be in the tavern.

570
01:34:56,847 --> 01:35:00,977
The air around here stinks anyway,
just like the food.

571
01:35:01,051 --> 01:35:03,019
But the month will go fast.

572
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:44,693
Right here.

573
01:35:45,763 --> 01:35:47,355
Let's go.

574
01:38:11,675 --> 01:38:13,870
l was worried about you.

575
01:38:13,944 --> 01:38:17,812
All alone with, uh,
so many problems to solve.

576
01:38:34,431 --> 01:38:36,558
lt's all right here.

577
01:38:41,905 --> 01:38:43,566
Go ahead.

578
01:39:51,909 --> 01:39:54,469
You shouldn't have shot
the apples off that tree.

579
01:40:06,456 --> 01:40:07,889
Put it on.

580
01:41:47,190 --> 01:41:50,182
What's he doing now,
this sheriff of El Paso?

581
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:53,525
Right now? Lookin' for the cash
that was in the bank.

582
01:41:54,665 --> 01:41:56,462
Right.

583
01:41:56,533 --> 01:42:01,334
And suppose he finds the bodies
of these men just outside El Paso...

584
01:42:01,405 --> 01:42:03,703
with lots of money on them?

585
01:42:05,242 --> 01:42:07,210
What will the sheriff think?

586
01:42:07,277 --> 01:42:09,074
Well, he--

587
01:42:09,146 --> 01:42:10,875
That's right.

588
01:43:29,459 --> 01:43:30,983
Slim.

589
01:43:34,231 --> 01:43:35,823
What is it, Nino?

590
01:43:37,734 --> 01:43:39,463
A change of plans.

591
01:43:39,536 --> 01:43:41,766
lndio wants you to--

592
01:44:23,146 --> 01:44:25,080
lt's not loaded.

593
01:44:48,872 --> 01:44:51,500
l think you should
get out fast now.

594
01:44:51,575 --> 01:44:54,840
Here's your guns without bullets.

595
01:44:54,911 --> 01:44:57,812
Listen. Don't you let lndio
find you both around.

596
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:49,988
l know you don't like questions,
but why are you doing this?

597
01:45:53,003 --> 01:45:55,995
How long have you known
that Monco's a bounty killer?

598
01:45:57,908 --> 01:46:00,172
l found out tonight. Why?

599
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:06,406
l knew he was one from
the first moment he arrived.

600
01:46:12,122 --> 01:46:15,057
The other one's also
a bounty killer.

601
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:18,719
So l have an idea.

602
01:46:18,795 --> 01:46:20,956
They'll be useful to us.

603
01:46:22,299 --> 01:46:23,926
We'll try it.

604
01:46:25,001 --> 01:46:28,493
Those men are a lot better
than mine with a gun.

605
01:46:28,572 --> 01:46:32,838
So we'll let all of them
get mixed up in a gun battle.

606
01:46:32,909 --> 01:46:35,844
But that won't
really matter to me.

607
01:46:38,448 --> 01:46:39,972
Or you.

608
01:46:42,118 --> 01:46:45,144
Because we'll be far away, right?

609
01:46:50,627 --> 01:46:53,323
And we'll have all the money.

610
01:46:55,899 --> 01:46:57,696
Go on.

611
01:46:57,767 --> 01:46:59,997
Go on and wake Cucillo.

612
01:47:49,452 --> 01:47:50,783
Who did it?

613
01:47:50,854 --> 01:47:53,414
Why don't you look
at the knife?

614
01:48:01,698 --> 01:48:03,666
lt's mine.

615
01:48:03,733 --> 01:48:06,702
Then it shouldn't be there,
should it?

616
01:48:16,312 --> 01:48:19,475
But l didn't kill him.
l didn't do it.

617
01:48:21,985 --> 01:48:24,647
lt's difficult to prove that.

618
01:48:27,390 --> 01:48:28,880
l am innocent.

619
01:48:28,958 --> 01:48:31,483
One of your horses is outside.

620
01:48:32,562 --> 01:48:35,030
Let's see if you can get to it.

621
01:49:22,779 --> 01:49:24,269
He just killed Slim.

622
01:49:26,249 --> 01:49:30,481
And he-- he helped those
two bounty killers get away.

623
01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:35,848
l want them back...

624
01:49:37,494 --> 01:49:39,189
right now.

625
01:49:52,108 --> 01:49:54,406
What are you doing here?

626
01:49:54,477 --> 01:49:56,968
Go and get them back!

627
01:50:01,217 --> 01:50:06,052
Those two bounty killers are sitting on
our backs and must be killed right away.

628
01:50:11,127 --> 01:50:13,061
We can't let 'em go free.

629
01:50:27,977 --> 01:50:29,535
lt's done now.

630
01:50:31,548 --> 01:50:33,846
Prepare to get out of here.

631
01:51:16,793 --> 01:51:18,055
Here.

632
01:51:19,829 --> 01:51:21,490
Hold it.

633
01:51:26,102 --> 01:51:28,969
Not a bad idea.

634
01:51:29,038 --> 01:51:31,563
But l'm one thing
you forgot about.

635
01:51:31,641 --> 01:51:33,336
Open it up now.

636
01:51:55,131 --> 01:51:57,361
All right, come on now,
open it.

637
01:52:55,825 --> 01:52:58,020
Leave lndio to me.

638
01:53:00,930 --> 01:53:02,454
All right.

639
01:53:34,797 --> 01:53:36,924
Where in hell is it?

640
01:54:05,194 --> 01:54:08,686
l'll kill 'em, but l'll rip
out their guts first.

641
01:54:08,765 --> 01:54:10,699
l have a plan.

642
01:54:17,140 --> 01:54:19,165
What?

643
01:54:19,242 --> 01:54:21,369
Let's just wait.

644
01:54:21,444 --> 01:54:23,571
They'll be back here.

645
01:54:25,615 --> 01:54:28,880
And this way,
there'll be two of us.

646
01:54:28,951 --> 01:54:32,114
Can they come back here?
Your men could've killed them.

647
01:54:32,188 --> 01:54:34,122
Who? They?

648
01:54:37,527 --> 01:54:41,122
Are you sure of that?
That they haven't?

649
01:54:44,734 --> 01:54:46,929
l thought something different.

650
01:54:47,003 --> 01:54:51,838
You made the boys ride on out to
make sure they're both killed, and fast.

651
01:54:51,908 --> 01:54:55,105
l'm not as dumb
as the rest of them.

652
01:54:56,279 --> 01:54:58,213
There was no help for it.

653
01:56:31,741 --> 01:56:33,265
Go on.

654
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:22,683
That watch--

655
01:58:24,153 --> 01:58:26,951
lt's been a long time
that l wanted to ask.

656
01:58:28,424 --> 01:58:31,188
l can see that it means
a lot to you.

657
01:58:31,260 --> 01:58:32,784
Why?

658
02:00:09,492 --> 02:00:11,084
Listen to me!

659
02:00:12,928 --> 02:00:15,089
This is Colonel Mortimer!

660
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:19,327
Douglas Mortimer!

661
02:00:21,604 --> 02:00:24,004
Does the name
mean anything to you?

662
02:01:56,565 --> 02:01:59,796
When the chimes end,
pick up your gun.

663
02:01:59,869 --> 02:02:02,235
Try and shoot me, Colonel.

664
02:02:04,874 --> 02:02:06,899
Just try.

665
02:04:01,991 --> 02:04:04,391
Very careless of you, old man.

666
02:04:30,619 --> 02:04:32,246
Try this.

667
02:04:39,395 --> 02:04:41,329
Now we start.

668
02:06:31,974 --> 02:06:33,271
Bravo.

669
02:07:14,850 --> 02:07:17,444
There seems to be
a family resemblance.

670
02:07:23,825 --> 02:07:25,417
Here.

671
02:07:30,065 --> 02:07:33,057
Naturally, between
brother and sister.

672
02:07:33,135 --> 02:07:34,727
My gun.

673
02:07:39,808 --> 02:07:41,070
My boy...

674
02:07:42,144 --> 02:07:44,510
you've become rich.

675
02:07:44,580 --> 02:07:47,242
You mean we've become rich,
old man.

676
02:07:47,316 --> 02:07:50,376
No, it's all for you.
l think you deserve it.

677
02:07:51,486 --> 02:07:53,818
What about our partnership?

678
02:07:56,258 --> 02:07:57,919
Maybe next time.

679
02:08:40,602 --> 02:08:44,834
Ten thousand, twelve thousand...

680
02:08:44,906 --> 02:08:46,305
fifteen...

681
02:08:47,376 --> 02:08:49,037
sixteen...

682
02:08:49,111 --> 02:08:50,408
seventeen...

683
02:08:52,147 --> 02:08:54,377
twenty-two--

684
02:09:01,823 --> 02:09:03,848
Twenty-seven.

685
02:09:05,527 --> 02:09:06,994
Any trouble, boy?

686
02:09:09,564 --> 02:09:11,156
No, old man.

687
02:09:12,534 --> 02:09:15,594
Thought l was having trouble
with my adding.

688
02:09:15,671 --> 02:09:17,070
lt's all right now.
