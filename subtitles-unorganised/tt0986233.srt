1
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,710
<i>There is a dirty protest, the Blanket Protest,
which has been going on for years,<i>

2
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:26,015
<i>all in support of the same demand: 
political status.<i>

3
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:30,435
<i>That is to say, different treatment 
for people who commit crimes,<i>

4
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,626
<i>hideous crimes,<i>

5
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:33,886
<i>for what the claim to be a political motive<i>

6
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:36,867
<i>and that is what the Government will not grant.

7
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:24,411
So Daniel he here's a noise 
coming from his Granny's room,

8
00:05:24,902 --> 00:05:26,804
he runs up to his Granny's room, 
he opens the door

9
00:05:26,805 --> 00:05:29,081
and there'a a waifer 
having a go with his Granny.

10
00:05:29,082 --> 00:05:32,663
The naughty fellow turns around and says:
"See, it's not so fucking funny with a German one."

11
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:47,520
<i>There is no such thing as political murder,
political bombing or political violence.</i>

12
00:08:47,606 --> 00:08:53,056
<i>There is only criminal murder,
criminal bombing and criminal violence.</i>

13
00:08:53,557 --> 00:09:01,190
<i>We will not compromise on this.
There will be no political status.</i>

14
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:34,517
I will not wear the uniform of a criminal.

15
00:09:34,603 --> 00:09:37,686
I demand to wear me own clothes.

16
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:52,742
<i>Non-conforming prisoner, 08-12-1980</i>

17
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:02,580
What?

18
00:14:07,662 --> 00:14:10,369
What's it you say your name is again?

19
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:13,017
- Gilan.
- Gilan. 

20
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:14,550
Aye. 

21
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,967
Fancy Quinn.

22
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:22,767
Falls Road. Fancy Quinn.
Do you know him?

23
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,911
- No.
- No?

24
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,592
How long did you get?

25
00:14:33,877 --> 00:14:36,136
Twelve years.

26
00:14:38,306 --> 00:14:40,860
And you?

27
00:14:44,396 --> 00:14:48,617
- Six years. Six.
- Six?

28
00:14:48,703 --> 00:14:51,305
Aye.

29
00:14:52,813 --> 00:14:55,736
You lucky bastard.

30
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:09,087
<i>... the political adviser of Merlin Reese,
when he was at the Home Office with Roger Darlington.</i>

31
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:14,298
<i>He rejects the official position on phone taps, 
saying that there has been only a modest overall increase,</i>

32
00:22:14,488 --> 00:22:17,788
<i>and says that Parliament has no way 
of knowing how much tapping goes on,</i>

33
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:23,939
<i>because the Prime Minister and other senior Ministers 
don't even have to get warrants to get a tap put into effect.</i>

34
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:05,892
What?

35
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,185
Get ready.

36
00:29:49,478 --> 00:29:53,521
- Are you all right, Bobby?
- I'm grand, Ma.

37
00:29:54,339 --> 00:29:59,566
- Are they giving you treatment for that?
- It's been looked after.

38
00:30:02,107 --> 00:30:04,212
And the young fellow?

39
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:07,859
He's a handful, I tell you that.

40
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:11,507
- Are you eating all right?
- I'm grand, Ma.

41
00:30:11,593 --> 00:30:15,939
- Are they feeding you all right?
- Don't you two be worrying about me.

42
00:30:17,944 --> 00:30:20,084
Five minutes.

43
00:30:20,596 --> 00:30:23,104
Five minutes.

44
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:27,033
- You eating all right?
- Aye.

45
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,598
- It tastes like shit, doesn't it?
- You get used to it.

46
00:30:35,178 --> 00:30:37,544
You're looking well.

47
00:30:38,901 --> 00:30:43,048
So are you, son. So are you.

48
00:30:58,213 --> 00:31:01,752
The righteous cry out.
And the Lord hears them.

49
00:31:01,838 --> 00:31:04,849
He delivers them from all their troubles.

50
00:31:04,935 --> 00:31:10,901
The Lord is close to the brokenhearted 
and saves those who are Christians first.

51
00:31:10,987 --> 00:31:16,411
The righteous man has many troubles,
but the Lord delivers him from them all.

52
00:31:16,497 --> 00:31:21,447
He protects all his bones
and not one of them will be broken.

53
00:31:23,907 --> 00:31:29,885
Evil will slay the wicked 
and the foes of the righteous will be condemned.

54
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,648
The Lord redeems his servants.

55
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:37,080
No one will be condemned,
who finds refuge in Him.

56
00:31:43,661 --> 00:31:45,919
Let us pray.

57
00:35:36,071 --> 00:35:39,870
- Damn dirty bastards!
- Fucking dirty bastards!

58
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:04,822
I- I- I. R. A. I- I- I. R. A.

59
00:36:04,908 --> 00:36:10,352
- I- I- I. R. A. I- I- I. R. A.
- Fucking bastards!

60
00:36:57,371 --> 00:37:01,152
- Everything in order?
- Yes, sir, in order, sir.

61
00:37:01,238 --> 00:37:03,417
Very good.

62
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:51,902
John! John!

63
00:39:15,975 --> 00:39:20,387
Get the fuck off me!

64
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:27,864
See that? See that?

65
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:30,547
Get the fuck off me!

66
00:39:31,989 --> 00:39:36,546
What are you doing to him?

67
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:41,490
Get the fuck off me, you damn!

68
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:19,525
Hi Mom.

69
00:42:30,995 --> 00:42:34,050
Why are you doing sitting in here?

70
00:43:00,863 --> 00:43:02,026
Daisies.

71
00:43:53,776 --> 00:43:55,481
You can sit down any time you like.

72
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:58,614
Priest etiquette.
Never sit before you're asked.

73
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,629
Sit down, Don.

74
00:44:00,715 --> 00:44:05,004
- Don't look them over till you're eager.
- Best to hover at the door.

75
00:44:05,221 --> 00:44:08,622
You learned that your first week at the seminary, boy.

76
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:16,354
- Cig?
- Come on.

77
00:44:19,902 --> 00:44:24,348
Bit of a break from smoking the Bible, eh?

78
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,473
Work out which pick is the best smoke?

79
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:34,695
We only smoke the Lamentations. 
Just right for a cigarette.

80
00:44:34,781 --> 00:44:38,703
Nice room.  Very clean.

81
00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:41,283
- Where is it you're from again, Don?
- Born, you mean?

82
00:44:41,369 --> 00:44:43,200
Ballygobackwards.

83
00:44:43,286 --> 00:44:46,078
- Oh, the city dog.
- Ballyroberts.

84
00:44:46,164 --> 00:44:49,912
We play south of Ballymonie: Kilrea.

85
00:44:50,793 --> 00:44:55,545
- I remember a homily you did in March sometime.
- Will you listen to it?

86
00:44:55,631 --> 00:44:58,484
- I'm sure the men hold you in high esteem.
- I can feel a dig coming on.

87
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,722
- You're very quick.
- Right.

88
00:45:00,829 --> 00:45:03,434
No, you're respected, you know that.

89
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:05,842
I like those stories you tell about the countryside.

90
00:45:05,928 --> 00:45:09,822
A child held for poaching, robbing apples, 
stampeding cattle...

91
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:13,576
- Fine education for a priest.
- A priest working in West Belfast? It is, aye.

92
00:45:13,662 --> 00:45:15,370
Stampeding comes in handy down in the Falls Road, eh?

93
00:45:15,456 --> 00:45:17,081
The RUC hate me.
(Royal Ulster Police, Protestant police.)

94
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:18,828
- You miss it though?
- What?

95
00:45:18,914 --> 00:45:20,218
The countryside.

96
00:45:20,304 --> 00:45:22,770
I sort of get home 
and see my wee brother every month or so...

97
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:27,028
but I miss the usual clean air... 
space, all that.

98
00:45:27,114 --> 00:45:31,472
- It feels closer to who you are.
- That it is, no question.

99
00:45:32,933 --> 00:45:35,500
Something like a fish out of water 
working in a big city like Belfast...

100
00:45:35,586 --> 00:45:38,500
but it's a job, isn't it?

101
00:45:38,671 --> 00:45:41,294
You stop looking around at your surroundings 
quick enough when you figure

102
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,770
that your business is the business 
of the soul and all.

103
00:45:44,856 --> 00:45:46,915
- Business of the soul?
- Aye. You know what I mean.

104
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:51,007
- I'm going down the same way too?
- Aye, and you can use that for your charge.

105
00:45:51,093 --> 00:45:53,150
Go on.

106
00:45:53,236 --> 00:45:55,852
Well, I suppose what I'm saying is...

107
00:45:55,938 --> 00:45:59,811
you get on.
Kilrea can wait until I'm an old man.

108
00:45:59,897 --> 00:46:03,174
- Too many scavengers will be saved in Belfast anyway.
- Busy work, aye.

109
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,849
- Should God award you in heaven?
- Aye, and I'll be thankful.

110
00:46:05,935 --> 00:46:09,138
Once there's wine involved.

111
00:46:10,532 --> 00:46:13,459
So what does your wee brother do back home?

112
00:46:15,256 --> 00:46:17,507
He is parish priest.

113
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,017
He's a sneaky wee bastard.
You know the sort, Bobby.

114
00:46:22,103 --> 00:46:24,812
- Still goes poaching.
- Poaching jobs.

115
00:46:24,898 --> 00:46:28,995
- And he's younger than me by 8 years all right.
- Go on.

116
00:46:29,748 --> 00:46:34,580
As a clergic, I work in a parish beside Kilrea. 
We hold the place...

117
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,386
working my ass off.

118
00:46:36,472 --> 00:46:38,646
Escorting the elderly, mobile confession.

119
00:46:38,732 --> 00:46:40,651
- The glamorous stuff.
- Oh, aye.

120
00:46:40,737 --> 00:46:44,524
- So, anyway, the position comes up in Kilrea.
- Right.

121
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:47,715
And I'm passed over for some reason or other.
No reason, probably.

122
00:46:47,801 --> 00:46:50,195
- For taking too much cake off the old ladies.
- Probably.

123
00:46:50,281 --> 00:46:52,327
So?

124
00:46:52,517 --> 00:46:56,152
So five years later
the position again comes up back in Kilrea...

125
00:46:56,238 --> 00:47:02,295
- and my brother Michael waltzes right in to it.
- Fuck.

126
00:47:03,136 --> 00:47:05,548
He is made parish priest at 28.

127
00:47:05,634 --> 00:47:08,534
More spiritual probably. 
Less liberal than you.

128
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,019
He worked the bishop. 
He's a golfer.

129
00:47:12,155 --> 00:47:15,052
- He's a pushy little twirp, that's what he is.
- At least you're not bitter.

130
00:47:15,138 --> 00:47:19,787
- Oh no, I couldn't be that.
- Parish priest at 28? Fantastic.

131
00:47:19,873 --> 00:47:22,019
He has two cars.

132
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:26,182
And the house he has is the most.
He has a maid, a cook.

133
00:47:26,268 --> 00:47:28,268
I'm stuck in a two up two down,

134
00:47:28,354 --> 00:47:31,357
with a fat Kerry man 
who drones on and on about Gaelic football.

135
00:47:31,443 --> 00:47:34,686
Can we stop talking about that?
Jesus! You're the one who's talking.

136
00:47:37,512 --> 00:47:40,247
- How's your smoke going?
- Grand.

137
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:43,521
- Filthy habit. Disgusting.
- Oh, yeah, awful. Lovely, though.

138
00:47:43,607 --> 00:47:46,287
Aye. Praise the Lord.

139
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:52,841
- 28. My God!
- Oh, stop it.

140
00:47:55,554 --> 00:47:58,328
- So, what happened to your eye, Bobby?
- What?

141
00:47:58,414 --> 00:48:01,566
- You got to dig for yourself, your eye?
- Differences of opinion.

142
00:48:01,652 --> 00:48:05,612
- How's the other fellow?
- A lot worse. Believe me.

143
00:48:06,345 --> 00:48:09,739
- So, what did you call me here for?
- Why, was that the issue you were trying to avoid?

144
00:48:09,825 --> 00:48:11,901
Priest etiquette. 
Start with the small talk.

145
00:48:11,987 --> 00:48:13,965
I'm learning a lot about the priesthood, Don.

146
00:48:14,051 --> 00:48:16,325
- You'd make a fine priest.
- Why?

147
00:48:16,411 --> 00:48:20,121
- Good talker. Man of principles. A leader of men.
- A political terrorist.

148
00:48:20,207 --> 00:48:23,904
- The church loves a reformed crook.
- Aye.

149
00:48:25,332 --> 00:48:28,574
I always felt that thief next to Jesus got off lightly.

150
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:31,102
- But he recognized his sins.
- Did he, though?

151
00:48:31,188 --> 00:48:33,267
Aye. Said as much.

152
00:48:33,353 --> 00:48:35,685
When you're hung from a cross 
you're gonna say anything.

153
00:48:35,771 --> 00:48:38,952
Jesus offers him a seat next to his Daddy,
in a place called Paradise.

154
00:48:39,038 --> 00:48:40,770
You know, you're always gonna put your hand up
and ask if you can have a piece of that.

155
00:48:40,856 --> 00:48:44,010
Aye. Even when he's nailed to a cross.

156
00:48:44,335 --> 00:48:46,737
- Jesus Christ! That's sacrilegious.
- Sacrilegious?

157
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:50,272
- Aye.
- No, no. He was a dirty thief.

158
00:48:51,575 --> 00:48:54,692
So, what did you want me to tell me?

159
00:48:54,888 --> 00:48:56,979
Where are you at?

160
00:48:57,065 --> 00:48:59,396
Been driven mad by that Governor yet?

161
00:48:59,482 --> 00:49:02,080
Says he's been negotiating.

162
00:49:02,501 --> 00:49:04,476
It's been a sideshow.
I can tell you that for nothing.

163
00:49:04,562 --> 00:49:06,741
But you understand why you need to do it.

164
00:49:06,827 --> 00:49:11,658
- Because we are no longer good propaganda.
- According to whom? The leadership?

165
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:16,762
The time has come.
A decision had to be made.

166
00:49:17,675 --> 00:49:20,266
Do you think that's what the leadership think?

167
00:49:20,352 --> 00:49:23,660
- Maybe. I do not know.
- Is there paranoia there, Bobby?

168
00:49:26,653 --> 00:49:29,594
Ten thousand people marched 
for seven hunger strikers last October, right?

169
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,460
- Right.
- International pressure on the Brits and all that.

170
00:49:31,546 --> 00:49:34,381
- As your time...
- Even the Pope is having a say, getting involved.

171
00:49:34,467 --> 00:49:38,233
The whole world trying to get Maggie Thatcher 
to back down and give us our demands,

172
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:39,369
but it all came to nothing.

173
00:49:39,455 --> 00:49:40,734
Right.

174
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,086
The hunger strike failed.

175
00:49:43,172 --> 00:49:48,229
We are on the frontline. We created the protest. 
It's our responsibility.

176
00:49:48,315 --> 00:49:50,246
Leadership may be very clear to me, Don.

177
00:49:50,332 --> 00:49:52,287
Four and half years in a 'no wash' protest,

178
00:49:52,373 --> 00:49:55,120
as much as it has highlightes republicanism 
to some extent...

179
00:49:55,206 --> 00:49:57,722
it has also distracted 
from the wider development of the organization.

180
00:49:57,808 --> 00:50:01,331
- That's because your needs are specific needs.
- Of course they are.

181
00:50:01,417 --> 00:50:03,892
Some women bringing up three children in West Belfast,

182
00:50:03,978 --> 00:50:07,809
shouldn't care about civilian type clothes
or whatever the fuck they're calling these clown outfits.

183
00:50:07,895 --> 00:50:09,703
- Not so.
- Honest to God, Don.

184
00:50:09,789 --> 00:50:12,816
We were promised our own clothes.
It's childish sculduggery.

185
00:50:12,902 --> 00:50:15,798
So the leadership have had enough of you?

186
00:50:17,207 --> 00:50:19,087
In an ideal world...

187
00:50:19,173 --> 00:50:22,331
we would be fighting our battles independently,
but we're tied.

188
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:24,366
Nothing has changed here,
nothing has moved on.

189
00:50:24,452 --> 00:50:25,644
The leadership are stuck with us,

190
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:28,434
until there's some realistic chance
of moving towards political status.

191
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,979
That's the hard truth of it.

192
00:50:30,065 --> 00:50:33,025
Say get me to negotiate with these lying, 
renegging monkeys,

193
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:35,439
when there's never nothing on the table, 
it's just pure crap.

194
00:50:35,525 --> 00:50:37,563
I'm not going to be marching 
to this Governor's office

195
00:50:37,649 --> 00:50:41,569
and get caught up in some mindless,
pointless dialogue with that pompous bastard.

196
00:50:41,655 --> 00:50:44,418
- He is a big fan of yours.
- Take his two short planks, Don. A moron.

197
00:50:44,504 --> 00:50:47,402
Can you believe that they made him governor though?
It's a bloody insult to humanity.

198
00:50:47,488 --> 00:50:50,913
Mother of Jesus!
Where do you get your energy from?

199
00:50:51,055 --> 00:50:53,711
I was a cross-country runner when I was a boy.

200
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:57,220
I could have guessed it. 
Big engine on you.

201
00:50:57,306 --> 00:50:59,953
Cross-country runner.

202
00:51:00,039 --> 00:51:03,915
- That explains a lot about you, Bobby.
- I loved it so bad.

203
00:51:04,001 --> 00:51:05,584
That's the whole country thing for me.

204
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:09,406
Jesus! They'd have to hold me back at finishing line 
or I'd keep on running.

205
00:51:09,492 --> 00:51:12,256
I was seen as a mongrel from out of the city.

206
00:51:12,342 --> 00:51:14,681
Frightening the cattle and all. 
It was a funny time.

207
00:51:14,767 --> 00:51:17,608
- Frightened the cattle?
- Oh, I terrified them.

208
00:51:17,694 --> 00:51:21,735
Think you can get milk and burgers from them monsters? 
Jesus Christ!

209
00:51:24,557 --> 00:51:28,197
The next time round I'm gonna be born 
in the countryside, guaranteed.

210
00:51:28,283 --> 00:51:32,243
Wild life, birds.
I love all that. Paradise.

211
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:37,399
- Aye. And you'd learn to relax too.
- Aye.

212
00:51:37,485 --> 00:51:41,273
Maybe, you never know. 
I've never tried it before.

213
00:51:42,253 --> 00:51:45,320
I'm starting a hunger strike on the 1st of March.

214
00:51:46,544 --> 00:51:49,572
That's why you're here.
That's what I'm telling you.

215
00:51:49,658 --> 00:51:52,513
Aye, I heard that.

216
00:51:55,714 --> 00:51:58,538
- Does your family know?
- I got word to them, aye.

217
00:51:58,624 --> 00:52:01,922
- Have you spoken with them?
- Got a visit in two week's time. We talked then.

218
00:52:02,008 --> 00:52:04,750
How do you think they will take it?

219
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:08,790
- What do you think, Don?
- And your wee boy?

220
00:52:26,773 --> 00:52:30,747
So, what makes it different from the last time?

221
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,226
Last time the strike was flawed.

222
00:52:34,312 --> 00:52:38,043
It became emotional.
Seven men started at the same time.

223
00:52:38,129 --> 00:52:39,902
They all got weak 
and couldn't let the weakest one die,

224
00:52:39,988 --> 00:52:42,215
which left us susceptible 
to being conned by the Brits,

225
00:52:42,301 --> 00:52:45,329
and that is exactly what we were.
Conned.

226
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:48,608
This time out, 
the men will start consecutively two weeks apart.

227
00:52:48,694 --> 00:52:50,282
Somebody dies, they'll be replaced.

228
00:52:50,368 --> 00:52:53,420
There is no shortage of us.
Seventy five men have put their names forward.

229
00:52:53,506 --> 00:52:55,888
For Christ's sake.

230
00:52:55,974 --> 00:52:58,958
The announcement is being made today.

231
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:06,149
So, what makes this protest different 
is that you accept to die, Bobby?

232
00:53:06,561 --> 00:53:08,132
It may well come to that.

233
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,802
You start a hunger strike to protest 
for what you believe in.

234
00:53:10,888 --> 00:53:15,096
You don't start already determined to die,
or am I missing something here?

235
00:53:15,182 --> 00:53:19,549
It's in their hands. Our message is clear.
They're seeing our determination.

236
00:53:20,018 --> 00:53:23,465
So there'll be a couple of deaths, 
do you think, maybe five or six,

237
00:53:23,551 --> 00:53:27,336
- but you have seventy-five of you.
- Aye, well, it won't come to that.

238
00:53:27,422 --> 00:53:30,726
All right, maybe the Brits will buckle 
after twenty or so.

239
00:53:30,812 --> 00:53:34,585
But why should you care?
Because you're already dead, right?

240
00:53:43,699 --> 00:53:46,780
Have you thought about you're going 
to be putting these boys through?

241
00:53:46,866 --> 00:53:50,066
I mean, putting aside what's going to happen 
to these poor men's families.

242
00:53:50,152 --> 00:53:53,619
You're going head to head with the British Government
who declaredly despise republicanism,

243
00:53:53,705 --> 00:53:56,120
who are unshakeable.

244
00:53:56,206 --> 00:53:59,656
They can easily live with the deaths
of what they call terrorists.

245
00:53:59,742 --> 00:54:02,413
- And the stakes are much higher this time.
- I know that.

246
00:54:02,499 --> 00:54:05,741
And if you're not even willing to negotiate,
you're looking for them to capitulate.

247
00:54:05,827 --> 00:54:07,018
- Is that it?
- Right.

248
00:54:07,104 --> 00:54:11,638
So failure means many dead men, 
families torn apart,

249
00:54:11,724 --> 00:54:14,119
and the whole Republican movement demoralised.

250
00:54:14,205 --> 00:54:16,997
Aye. Worst case scenario 
it might well mean all that,

251
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:19,112
- but in short term, under the ashes...
- Come on!

252
00:54:19,198 --> 00:54:21,456
Guaranteed, there will be a new generation
of men and women,

253
00:54:21,542 --> 00:54:24,070
- even more resilient, more determined.
- Look who you're talking to.

254
00:54:24,156 --> 00:54:27,638
There's a war going on, I thought you might understand. 
You're talking like a foreigner.

255
00:54:27,724 --> 00:54:30,389
You're talking to me like I'm a foreigner.
Do you think I don't know Northern Ireland?

256
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:32,221
- I live here, man.
- Then support us.

257
00:54:32,307 --> 00:54:36,587
I supported the first hunger strike 
on the basis it was a protest.

258
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:40,011
Not some pre-design to die
and balk at negotiation,

259
00:54:40,097 --> 00:54:43,732
other than complete surrender from Thatcher.
That's ridiculous Bobby. It's destructive.

260
00:54:43,818 --> 00:54:45,894
What's happened in here for the last four years?

261
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:49,589
The brutality, humiliation.
Our basic human rights taken away from us.

262
00:54:49,675 --> 00:54:52,822
- All this must come to an end.
- Through talking.

263
00:54:53,068 --> 00:54:54,461
So what?

264
00:54:54,547 --> 00:54:56,124
We take their offer and put their uniform on?

265
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,763
Because the last four years are meant nothing?

266
00:54:58,849 --> 00:55:02,389
We can do that, Don,
or we can behave like the army we proclaim to be

267
00:55:02,475 --> 00:55:04,166
and lay down our lives for our comrades.

268
00:55:04,252 --> 00:55:06,669
Is there not even small part in you
that's open for a breakthrough,

269
00:55:06,755 --> 00:55:10,058
- that could find you negotiating again?
- That won't happen.

270
00:55:10,144 --> 00:55:15,722
Forget about that. I want to know whether your intent 
is just purely to commit suicide here.

271
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:20,437
You want me to argue...

272
00:55:20,523 --> 00:55:24,604
about the morality of what I'm about to do
and whether it's really suicide or not?

273
00:55:25,881 --> 00:55:28,339
For one in your corner it's suicide.
I call it murder.

274
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:30,871
And that's just another wee difference 
between us two.

275
00:55:30,957 --> 00:55:33,402
We are both Catholic men.
Both Republicans.

276
00:55:33,488 --> 00:55:35,495
But while you were poaching salmon
in lovely Kilrea,

277
00:55:35,581 --> 00:55:37,364
- we were being burnt out of our houses in Rathcoole.
- Right.

278
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:41,458
Similar in many ways, Don, 
but life and experience are focused up differently.

279
00:55:41,544 --> 00:55:42,999
- Do you understand me?
- I understand.

280
00:55:43,085 --> 00:55:47,834
I have my belief and in all its simplicity,
that is the most powerful thing.

281
00:55:49,173 --> 00:55:51,576
So what's your statement by dying?

282
00:55:52,845 --> 00:55:55,960
Just highlighting British intransigence, 
so fucking what?

283
00:55:56,046 --> 00:55:58,052
- The whole world knows what the Brits are like.
- Good.

284
00:55:58,138 --> 00:56:00,797
Aye. It is good.
And it has nothing to do with you.

285
00:56:00,883 --> 00:56:02,981
The Brits have been fucking up everything 
for centuries.

286
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:06,546
- I can feel your hatred, Don.
- Are you looking for martyrdom?

287
00:56:06,632 --> 00:56:07,563
- No.
- Are you sure?

288
00:56:07,771 --> 00:56:08,467
Aye. 

289
00:56:08,553 --> 00:56:10,846
Because I've heard you eulogizing Wolf Tone,

290
00:56:10,932 --> 00:56:13,588
McConnely, Mike Sweeney, all them men.

291
00:56:13,674 --> 00:56:16,396
Don't talk thinking you're writing your name 
in laurels for all them history books.

292
00:56:16,482 --> 00:56:18,864
- Oh, and you think that matters to me?
- Aye, I know it does.

293
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:21,091
Well, you're wrong.

294
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,501
You say you're soldiers.

295
00:56:24,587 --> 00:56:27,543
It's all about the freedom.

296
00:56:27,629 --> 00:56:30,329
But you've got no appreciation of a life, Bobby.

297
00:56:30,415 --> 00:56:33,620
You no longer know what a life is, young man.

298
00:56:33,706 --> 00:56:36,954
Four years living in these conditions, 
no one expects you to be normal.

299
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,415
There is nothing normal about you.

300
00:56:40,444 --> 00:56:44,359
Right now the Republican Movement 
has talked itself into a corner.

301
00:56:44,565 --> 00:56:49,360
You and the IRA are standing right behind it 
looking into that corner. All that history.

302
00:56:49,446 --> 00:56:53,041
All them dead men and women.
You're still saying nothing.

303
00:56:53,127 --> 00:56:55,660
And your answer is to kill everything,
you've blinded yourself.

304
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:58,966
And you're scared to stop it.

305
00:56:59,725 --> 00:57:02,969
Afraid of living, afraid to talk in peace.

306
00:57:03,055 --> 00:57:06,479
So what would Ulster be 
if it wasn't turning itself to shit?

307
00:57:07,765 --> 00:57:09,867
And this situation here...

308
00:57:09,953 --> 00:57:13,470
the future of the Republican Movement
is in the hands of you men,

309
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:17,441
who have lost all sense of reality.

310
00:57:17,649 --> 00:57:19,934
You think your head's on right?

311
00:57:21,401 --> 00:57:23,725
Locked up here 24 hours a day in piss and shit,

312
00:57:23,811 --> 00:57:26,762
and you are making decisions
that could see so many men die?

313
00:57:26,848 --> 00:57:30,671
Build a statue to Bobby Sands.
You're joking me!

314
00:57:30,757 --> 00:57:32,969
Freedom Fighter?

315
00:57:33,556 --> 00:57:36,148
They are the men and women
working out there in the community,

316
00:57:36,234 --> 00:57:39,605
and that was you once upon a time, 
am I right?

317
00:57:39,691 --> 00:57:42,486
All that work you did in Twin Brook.

318
00:57:42,633 --> 00:57:46,832
That is where we need you, Bobby,
and you know I'm right.

319
00:57:47,787 --> 00:57:50,747
But I'm deluded.
You want me to answer that?

320
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:53,917
- They're beating your ball, here. You're playing into their hands.
- The strategy's in place.

321
00:57:53,918 --> 00:57:57,253
- Then stop it. Just say you'll stop.
- You don't understand a thing.

322
00:57:57,254 --> 00:57:59,928
You're in no shape to make this call.

323
00:57:59,929 --> 00:58:05,002
- It's done. It won't be stopped.
- Then fuck it! Life must mean nothing to you.

324
00:58:06,565 --> 00:58:09,296
God's gonna punish me.

325
00:58:14,514 --> 00:58:20,428
Well, if not just for the suicide, 
then he'd have to punish you for your stupidity.

326
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:23,397
Aye.

327
00:58:23,483 --> 00:58:25,901
And you for your arrogance.

328
00:58:25,987 --> 00:58:29,378
Because my life is a real life,
not some theological exercise,

329
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:32,715
some religious trick
that's got to fuck all to do with living.

330
00:58:33,234 --> 00:58:34,547
Jesus Christ had a backbone,

331
00:58:34,633 --> 00:58:37,189
but see them disciples, every disciple since?

332
00:58:37,275 --> 00:58:40,892
You're just jumping in and out of the rhetoric
and dead-end semantics.

333
00:58:40,978 --> 00:58:42,233
You need the revolutionaries.

334
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:44,614
You need the cultural political soldier 
to give life a pulse,

335
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,068
- to give life a direction.
- This is stupid talk. You're deluded.

336
00:58:47,154 --> 00:58:48,987
Aye. So you say.

337
00:58:49,073 --> 00:58:51,560
- And what's your wee son going to say?
- Fuck off.

338
00:58:51,646 --> 00:58:53,712
Doesn't that interest you?

339
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:56,177
You're going to attack me with sentiment?

340
00:58:56,501 --> 00:58:58,280
- Typical priest.
- What's your heart saying, Bobby?

341
00:58:58,366 --> 00:59:02,510
- I thought you had me all figured out, Don.
- What is it saying? Tell me.

342
00:59:05,817 --> 00:59:09,421
My life means everything to me.
Freedom means everything.

343
00:59:10,102 --> 00:59:13,857
I know that you don't mean to mock me, Don.
So I just let all that pass.

344
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,183
This is one of those times when we've come to a pause.

345
00:59:17,269 --> 00:59:19,953
It's a time to keep your beliefs pure.

346
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:23,818
I believe that a united Ireland is right and just.

347
00:59:24,236 --> 00:59:27,662
Maybe it's impossible 
for a man like you to understand.

348
00:59:28,156 --> 00:59:29,884
But having respect for my life,

349
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:33,617
a desire for freedom,
an unyielding love for that belief,

350
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:37,013
means I can see past any doubts I may have.

351
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:41,069
Putting my life on the line is not just 
the only thing I can do, Don.

352
00:59:41,155 --> 00:59:43,267
It's the right thing.

353
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,731
This is why you called me here.

354
00:59:51,458 --> 00:59:54,919
Needed a sounding board?
Not 100% sure of yourself.

355
00:59:55,005 --> 00:59:58,632
- Endebting yourself, maybe?
- Aye.

356
00:59:58,918 --> 01:00:02,829
- Well, I'm only human.
- And I've made it clear for you, then.

357
01:00:04,373 --> 01:00:08,610
Man of the guidance, Don. 
Business of the soul.

358
01:00:19,294 --> 01:00:22,697
You been to Gweedore, in Donegal?

359
01:00:22,962 --> 01:00:24,004
Aye.

360
01:00:31,955 --> 01:00:34,434
I went there when I was 12.

361
01:00:35,741 --> 01:00:38,353
Big cross-country race for the boys.

362
01:00:38,439 --> 01:00:42,728
And we were all in the back of a minibus 
headed towards Derry one morning.

363
01:00:43,309 --> 01:00:45,714
I mean, this is big time.

364
01:00:45,927 --> 01:00:50,908
I mean, this is like international athletics for us
because we were racing against boys in the South

365
01:00:50,994 --> 01:00:54,070
and we had this thing to do Belfast pride.

366
01:00:55,222 --> 01:00:59,476
A few boys were Protestants
and the rest of us were Catholics.

367
01:00:59,562 --> 01:01:01,672
It was a cross-community event.

368
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:04,970
I suppose the good people in the south 
think this is great stuff.

369
01:01:05,056 --> 01:01:09,475
Let's get this wee team over from Belfast
and all that patronizing shit.

370
01:01:11,819 --> 01:01:13,081
Anyway...

371
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,373
we went through the border.

372
01:01:17,665 --> 01:01:20,738
The boys singing pop tunes and all...

373
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,210
but I'm just in the back of the bus 
looking out the window.

374
01:01:25,456 --> 01:01:30,554
We're going through the mountains. 
You know, where Mount Errigal is in them?

375
01:01:31,367 --> 01:01:34,186
It's a beautiful sight, Don.

376
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:38,522
Donegal is the most beautiful place in Ireland, 
I reckon.

377
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,563
Aye.

378
01:01:47,048 --> 01:01:49,371
Anyway...

379
01:01:50,788 --> 01:01:57,795
when we arrived at Gweedore... what a place. 
There were about 200 boys in there,

380
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,645
getting into their gear and limnering up.

381
01:02:01,501 --> 01:02:03,084
The whole event is run by Christian Brothers

382
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:08,501
and they're clipping young fellows around in the back of the ears,
basically trying to obtain some order.

383
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:12,925
Our team goes off for a wee jog, 
to stretch out the legs.

384
01:02:14,754 --> 01:02:18,509
And we're surrounded by fields of barley.
 

385
01:02:18,726 --> 01:02:21,637
And I dip down into a wee valley 
where there's a stream

386
01:02:21,638 --> 01:02:23,665
and woods running through it.

387
01:02:26,514 --> 01:02:29,314
The woods and the stream are out of bounds 
so, naturally,

388
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,123
us Belfast boys had to go check it, right?

389
01:02:32,209 --> 01:02:35,607
The woods and the stream 
seemed like the Amazon to us.

390
01:02:37,264 --> 01:02:41,058
As we come across, 
these young fellows from Cork...

391
01:02:41,144 --> 01:02:42,967
there's some banter about our accents...

392
01:02:43,053 --> 01:02:46,667
They could barely talk, 
we couldn't understand what they were saying.

393
01:02:47,334 --> 01:02:50,065
You get the idea that they are lording it over us...

394
01:02:50,151 --> 01:02:53,417
Looking down on us, I'm sensing it anyway.

395
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:56,128
We run along...

396
01:02:56,214 --> 01:03:01,130
and we come up with this idea to go down to the stream 
and check it out for fish.

397
01:03:01,582 --> 01:03:06,655
So we went to the river, downstream,
and there's half a foot of water there...

398
01:03:06,852 --> 01:03:09,277
and a silver fish, but nothing substantial,

399
01:03:09,363 --> 01:03:12,406
until one of our boys calls us further down.

400
01:03:13,618 --> 01:03:16,840
Lying in the water is a wee foal...

401
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:21,508
four or five days old. 
He was all skin and bone, a gray color.

402
01:03:21,594 --> 01:03:26,739
And it's got flakes of blood in his coat 
because he's cut himself up really badly in the sharp rocks...

403
01:03:29,344 --> 01:03:33,210
We were standing over him 
and you could see his back legs snapped...

404
01:03:33,296 --> 01:03:36,691
He's breathing, he's alive, 
but just about.

405
01:03:38,506 --> 01:03:43,875
So this big conversation gets started up between the boys 
who suddenly reckon themselves the leaders...

406
01:03:43,961 --> 01:03:46,138
and deliberating as what we should do.

407
01:03:46,224 --> 01:03:48,027
Someone says drop a rock on his head,

408
01:03:48,113 --> 01:03:51,915
but I'm looking in their faces 
and I can see they are either scared stiff or clueless.

409
01:03:52,001 --> 01:03:54,141
It's all bravado.

410
01:03:54,618 --> 01:03:58,176
And this foal on the ground in real pain.

411
01:03:58,262 --> 01:04:01,883
All this chitchat going on going nowhere.

412
01:04:03,004 --> 01:04:06,369
Next thing, one of the priests sees us, 
sees the foal,

413
01:04:06,455 --> 01:04:08,125
tells us not to move it 
and that we were done for...

414
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:09,770
We were really done for.

415
01:04:09,856 --> 01:04:11,979
Group of boys will always get the blame 
for hurting a foal.

416
01:04:12,065 --> 01:04:14,922
A group of Belfast boys
will get a hammering for sure.

417
01:04:15,008 --> 01:04:16,709
So it's clear to me in an instant.

418
01:04:16,795 --> 01:04:21,686
I get down on my knees and take the foal's head 
in my hands and I put him underwater.

419
01:04:21,962 --> 01:04:26,525
He's thrashing around a bit at the start, 
so I press down harder until he's drowned.

420
01:04:28,626 --> 01:04:30,991
The priests arrived, Don.

421
01:04:31,836 --> 01:04:36,570
Just grabbing me by the hair, dragging me through the woods, 
promising me a proper punishment.

422
01:04:36,656 --> 01:04:40,023
But I knew I did the right thing 
by that wee foal...

423
01:04:40,691 --> 01:04:44,023
and I could take the punishment for all our boys.

424
01:04:44,148 --> 01:04:48,315
I had the respect of the other boys now, 
and I knew that.

425
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:56,877
I'm clear of the reasons, Don.

426
01:04:57,266 --> 01:05:00,594
And clear of all the repercussions.

427
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:04,925
But I will act and I will not stand by 
and do nothing.

428
01:05:41,114 --> 01:05:43,438
You can leave them there if you like.

429
01:05:43,524 --> 01:05:46,888
Don't want me rolling up 
the letter of St. John, do you?

430
01:05:51,766 --> 01:05:54,832
Couldn't have that in my conscience, no.

431
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:05,036
I don't think I'm gonna see you again, Bobby.

432
01:06:06,167 --> 01:06:08,659
There's no need, Don.

433
01:09:35,226 --> 01:09:40,000
<i>Faced now with the failure 
of their discredited cause,</i>

434
01:09:40,086 --> 01:09:43,141
<i>the men of violence 
have chosen in recent months</i>

435
01:09:43,227 --> 01:09:48,118
<i>to play what may well be their last card.</i>

436
01:09:48,204 --> 01:09:51,145
<i>They have turned their violence 
against themselves</i>

437
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:55,376
<i>through the prison hunger strike to death.</i>

438
01:09:55,462 --> 01:10:01,414
<i>They seek to work on the most basic
of human emotions, pity...</i>

439
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,926
<i>as a means of creating tension</i>

440
01:10:04,012 --> 01:10:08,246
<i>and stoking the fires 
of bitterness and hatred.</i>

441
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:43,711
And from week one there has been a gradual deterioration
of the liver, kidney, and pancreatic function.

442
01:10:44,548 --> 01:10:49,777
Also the bone density decreases substantially 
due to calcium and vitamin deficiencies.

443
01:10:53,006 --> 01:10:54,935
The muscles of the heart is also undernourished,

444
01:10:55,021 --> 01:10:58,572
causing impaired function
and eventually cardiac failure.

445
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:08,589
The left ventricle can shrink to 70%
of its normal size.

446
01:11:10,826 --> 01:11:15,393
He will have low blood sugar, 
low energy and muscular wasting.

447
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:21,477
He will be experiencing gastro-intestinal ulcers 
with the thinning of the intestinal wall

448
01:11:21,563 --> 01:11:24,437
