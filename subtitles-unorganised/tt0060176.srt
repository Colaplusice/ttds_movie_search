15
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,531
Can't what?

16
00:05:57,141 --> 00:05:59,083
lt doesn't matter.

17
00:06:04,884 --> 00:06:07,634
who the hell were you with last night?

18
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,834
Reg.

19
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,268
Reg, let's have some noise, can we?

20
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,802
Right.

21
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:04,614
That's good. That's good.
Hold that.

22
00:07:36,938 --> 00:07:38,629
Reg.

23
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:52,929
Give it to me now.
Come on. That's good.

24
00:07:55,592 --> 00:07:57,283
Hunch. Hunch more.

25
00:07:57,448 --> 00:07:59,553
That's it. That's good.

26
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:04,870
That's good. And the hair back.
And the hair back.

27
00:08:05,703 --> 00:08:08,550
That's great. That's great!
That's good. More of that.

28
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,394
Now give it to me. Really give it to me.
Come on, now.

29
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,969
As fast as you can, give it to me.
Come on, right forward.

30
00:08:16,134 --> 00:08:19,745
That's good. This side. This side.
Lean right forward. Hand up.

31
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:22,723
That's great. Just touch the face.
That's very good.

32
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:25,984
And again around this way.
Touch the face again.

33
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:28,734
Good. Now the hair.
Marvelous. That's great.

34
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,769
Good. Yes, the hair.
Much more. Much more.

35
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,452
Good. Yes, that's great.
That's good. Yes. And again. And again.

36
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,871
Oh, hold that.
Hold the hair back. Again. Good.

37
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,942
Okay, Reg, 5o.

38
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:46,455
On your back. On your back. Go on.

39
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:50,459
Yes. Now really give it to me. Come on.

40
00:08:50,626 --> 00:08:53,691
Come on. work, work, work!

41
00:08:53,857 --> 00:08:57,206
Great. Great. And again.
Go on. Back. Back. Arms up.

42
00:08:57,377 --> 00:09:00,028
Stretch yourself, little lady. Great.

43
00:09:00,193 --> 00:09:02,942
And again. Go on. Go. Go.

44
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,767
That's great.

45
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:11,677
That's it. Keep it up. Lovely.

46
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,328
Yeah, make it come. Great.

47
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,364
No, no, head up. Head up.

48
00:09:17,951 --> 00:09:20,090
Now for me, love. For me.

49
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:24,346
Now! Now! Yes! Yes! Yes!

50
00:09:46,972 --> 00:09:48,564
Hello?

51
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:50,422
Yeah, hold on.

52
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:53,397
lt's Peter.

53
00:09:54,523 --> 00:09:56,017
Hello?

54
00:09:57,691 --> 00:09:59,632
Yes.

55
00:09:59,802 --> 00:10:01,777
Yes.

56
00:10:01,946 --> 00:10:04,629
Yeah, l've got it somewhere.
l know l have.

57
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,890
Yeah, hold on.

58
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:12,083
Reg, take down the address
of that bloody junk shop, would you?

59
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,852
why, they're fabulous. Go on.

60
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:47,182
Yeah.

61
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:52,331
Yeah. Great.

62
00:10:52,725 --> 00:10:55,180
Here. You can burn that lot.

63
00:11:17,362 --> 00:11:19,216
Reg!

64
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:23,624
-Get the birds down, will you?
-Okay.

65
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,573
No chewing gum. Get rid of it.

66
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,489
And not on my floor.

67
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:14,986
You, arm down.

68
00:12:15,595 --> 00:12:17,122
Right.

69
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,523
Six millimeter.

70
00:12:26,506 --> 00:12:28,360
Terrible.

71
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:33,219
How about the leg
a little further forward?

72
00:12:34,313 --> 00:12:36,004
Put the head up.

73
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:49,790
Just go. Mouth open. Yes, good. Good.

74
00:13:15,204 --> 00:13:19,132
No, you're all wrong. Start again.
Rethink it. Rethink it.

75
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,009
Stripes, let the dress just fall down.
Keep the stripes straight.

76
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,473
Just let your arms
go up and down.

77
00:13:29,635 --> 00:13:33,464
Yes, very tasty. Yes, l like it.
l like it. Go on.

78
00:13:33,954 --> 00:13:35,296
Yeah.

79
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,498
All right, change position.

80
00:13:41,442 --> 00:13:42,968
Yep.

81
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:46,206
wake up!

82
00:13:48,609 --> 00:13:51,957
You can thank your lucky stars
you're working with me, can't you?

83
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:53,951
All right, one more.

84
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:57,077
And let's smile now. Come on.

85
00:13:57,408 --> 00:13:59,350
Smile.

86
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,658
Smile.

87
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:07,995
God.

88
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,445
l asked you to smile.

89
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,851
what's the matter?

90
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:20,764
Have you forgotten what a smile is?

91
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,748
Hey?!

92
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:33,779
All right, you're all tired now.
Go on, relax.

93
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,617
l can't see your eyeballs anymore.
They're just slits.

94
00:14:39,675 --> 00:14:41,169
Go on.

95
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,705
Close your eyes.

96
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:47,281
Close your eyes.

97
00:14:50,298 --> 00:14:52,632
And stay like that.

98
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,893
lt's good for you.

99
00:15:13,048 --> 00:15:14,771
Close your eyes.

100
00:15:57,842 --> 00:16:00,744
That must be five or six years old.

101
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:09,194
They don't mean anything
when l do them. Just a mess.

102
00:16:10,897 --> 00:16:15,883
Afterwards, l find something
to hang on to, like that--

103
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:18,383
Quite like that leg.

104
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:26,220
Then it sorts itself out and adds up.

105
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:31,726
lt's like finding a clue
in a detective story.

106
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,508
Don't ask me about this one.
l don't know yet.

107
00:16:39,118 --> 00:16:41,605
-Can l buy it?
-No.

108
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:45,383
will you give it to me?

109
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,954
There.

110
00:17:27,912 --> 00:17:29,887
Tight-faced bastard.

111
00:17:30,056 --> 00:17:33,372
He won't float me
one of his crappy paintings.

112
00:17:44,103 --> 00:17:47,070
l'll creep down one night
and knock it off.

113
00:17:57,862 --> 00:18:00,283
Don't stop, it's lovely.

114
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:04,891
You look tired.

115
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,156
l've been all night in a doss house.

116
00:18:38,657 --> 00:18:41,624
They say they've been
asked to come here.

117
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:46,680
-Not by me.
-well, we weren't exactly asked.

118
00:18:48,064 --> 00:18:49,852
Sorry, l'm busy.

119
00:18:50,015 --> 00:18:53,364
They're printing some snaps
for me upstairs. Go and fetch them.

120
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,700
Couldn't you give us
just a couple of minutes?

121
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,458
A couple of minutes?

122
00:19:02,622 --> 00:19:06,102
l haven't even got a couple of minutes
to have my appendix out.

123
00:19:34,235 --> 00:19:36,918
-well, when can we come then?
-Don't.

124
00:19:39,898 --> 00:19:45,015
-The others still waiting with their eyes shut?
-Yes, they're waiting, but their eyes are open.

125
00:19:45,177 --> 00:19:46,835
Good.

126
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,524
Tell them to shut them again.

127
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:02,194
Get rid of that bag. lt's diabolical.

128
00:20:05,911 --> 00:20:08,944
Can we come back this afternoon?

129
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:55,396
-what do you want?
-Just looking around.

130
00:21:55,562 --> 00:21:58,726
There are no cheap bargains here.
You're wasting your time.

131
00:21:58,891 --> 00:22:00,963
well, l'll just have a look.

132
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,610
what are you looking for?

133
00:22:04,778 --> 00:22:07,974
-Pictures.
-No pictures.

134
00:22:12,425 --> 00:22:14,497
what kind of pictures?

135
00:22:18,024 --> 00:22:22,050
-Landscapes.
-Sorry, no landscapes.

136
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:34,083
Sold. All sold.

137
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,951
-You the owner?
-No, the owner is out.

138
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:45,918
Expecting him?

139
00:28:37,855 --> 00:28:39,349
what are you doing?

140
00:28:39,582 --> 00:28:41,556
Stop it! Stop it!

141
00:28:41,726 --> 00:28:44,442
Give me those. You can't
photograph people like that.

142
00:28:44,605 --> 00:28:46,515
who says l can't?

143
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:49,533
l'm only doing my job.
Some people are bullfighters...

144
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:51,580
...some people are politicians.

145
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:53,115
l'm a photographer.

146
00:28:54,429 --> 00:28:58,422
This is a public place. Everyone has
the right to be left in peace.

147
00:28:59,868 --> 00:29:02,802
lt's not my fault if there's no peace.

148
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,871
You know, most girls would pay me
to photograph them.

149
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:10,225
l'll pay you.

150
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:12,754
l overcharge.

151
00:29:12,922 --> 00:29:15,639
There are other things
l want on the reel.

152
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:29,878
what do we do then?

153
00:29:30,616 --> 00:29:32,820
l send you the photographs.

154
00:29:33,016 --> 00:29:35,121
No, l want them now.

155
00:29:41,751 --> 00:29:42,961
No!

156
00:29:43,127 --> 00:29:45,069
what's the rush?

157
00:29:51,574 --> 00:29:54,573
Don't let's spoil everything.
we've only just met.

158
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:09,235
No, we haven't met.
You've never seen me.

159
00:31:15,661 --> 00:31:17,962
-Hello.
-Hello.

160
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,566
-My agent saw you about this shop.
-Did he?

161
00:31:23,084 --> 00:31:24,610
He's a man with a cigar.

162
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:26,721
Throws ash everywhere.

163
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:29,321
l expect l remember him.

164
00:31:30,315 --> 00:31:32,966
l probably asked
for too much money.

165
00:31:33,131 --> 00:31:35,847
Money's always a problem, isn't it?

166
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,769
Tell him to come back.

167
00:31:44,585 --> 00:31:46,472
why are you selling?

168
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:55,175
l'd like to try something different.

169
00:31:55,337 --> 00:31:57,125
Get off somewhere.

170
00:31:57,288 --> 00:32:00,103
l'm fed up with antiques.

171
00:32:00,936 --> 00:32:02,594
Get off where?

172
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,254
To Nepal.

173
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:08,286
Nepal is all antiques.

174
00:32:08,455 --> 00:32:09,949
ls it?

175
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:15,681
Perhaps l better try Morocco.

176
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:26,239
-How much?
-what?

177
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:28,380
The propeller.

178
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,831
You can have it for...

179
00:32:32,996 --> 00:32:35,265
-...8 pounds.
-Right. You're in business.

180
00:32:35,428 --> 00:32:38,078
-Have you got a van?
-You can't take it now.

181
00:32:38,243 --> 00:32:39,803
l must.

182
00:32:39,971 --> 00:32:41,181
l must.

183
00:32:41,347 --> 00:32:43,257
-l can't live without it.
-Hard luck.

184
00:32:43,427 --> 00:32:47,202
That'll teach you to fall in love
with heavy things on Saturday mornings.

185
00:32:57,793 --> 00:33:00,575
-ls that it?
-That's it.

186
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:08,152
You can't treat it like that.
lt's not a delivery van.

187
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,069
-who cares?
-Leave it to me.

188
00:33:11,231 --> 00:33:13,370
Something will turn up.

189
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,951
Yes. All right, but it
better turn up today.

190
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:06,003
Blue 439. Blue 439. Over.

191
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:09,620
439, go ahead, please. Over.

192
00:34:09,913 --> 00:34:11,408
Hello, this is....

193
00:34:11,577 --> 00:34:15,538
Get me Flaxton 2-249.
Mr. walker. Mr. Peter walker.

194
00:34:15,705 --> 00:34:19,250
Tell him l saw the junk shop.
lt's pricey, but the kid will come down.

195
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:21,751
Let him ring her right away, then...

196
00:34:22,136 --> 00:34:24,307
...nobody else will get it.

197
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:27,925
Roger Wilco. Stand by.

198
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:36,333
Blue 439. Blue 439. Over.

199
00:34:36,503 --> 00:34:38,869
Blue 439. Blue 439. Go ahead, echo.

200
00:34:39,031 --> 00:34:42,827
Blue 439, message passed. The number
stored. Your caller doesn't like it.

201
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,070
Tell him to get stuffed.

202
00:34:45,238 --> 00:34:47,987
what about all the buildings
going up around the place?

203
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:51,727
Already there are queers
and poodles in the area.

204
00:34:52,628 --> 00:34:55,017
l saw some in the couple
of minutes l was there.

205
00:34:55,189 --> 00:35:00,142
-lt'll go like a bomb. Over.
-Blue 439. What is in the area? Over.

206
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:04,235
-Forget it. Over.
-Roger Wilco. Standing by.

207
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,262
You want to use the lot?

208
00:35:43,023 --> 00:35:44,910
Don't you like them?

209
00:35:45,135 --> 00:35:46,989
They're great.

210
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:54,853
we'll use three or four.

211
00:35:55,662 --> 00:35:57,036
Spread through the book?

212
00:35:57,742 --> 00:35:59,814
No. All together.

213
00:36:00,045 --> 00:36:01,867
Yeah.

214
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,358
-And a pint.
-Yes, sir.

215
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:11,400
which one last?

216
00:36:11,564 --> 00:36:14,214
None of this lot.
l've got something fab for the end.

217
00:36:14,379 --> 00:36:18,056
ln a park. l only took them this morning.
You'll get them later today.

218
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:21,415
lt's very peaceful, very still.

219
00:36:21,771 --> 00:36:25,894
And the rest of the book will be pretty
violent, so it's best to end it like that.

220
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,431
Yes.

221
00:36:27,594 --> 00:36:29,416
That's best.

222
00:36:29,866 --> 00:36:31,873
Rings truer.

223
00:36:45,992 --> 00:36:48,195
l'm going off London this week.

224
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,986
why?

225
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,298
lt doesn't do anything for me.

226
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:58,210
Yeah.

227
00:36:58,374 --> 00:37:01,309
-l've knocked up a few captions.
-Yeah?

228
00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:14,497
l'm fed up with those bloody bitches.

229
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:17,148
l wish l had tons of money.

230
00:37:17,316 --> 00:37:19,203
Then l'd be free.

231
00:37:19,396 --> 00:37:21,371
Free to do what?

232
00:37:22,116 --> 00:37:23,610
Free like him?

233
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,654
Someone we know?

234
00:39:10,936 --> 00:39:12,594
That'll be all right.

235
00:40:39,726 --> 00:40:44,265
Hello. Could you get me Frobershire 3-229,
please? l've only got a sixpence.

236
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:47,849
Park 1 296.

237
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,975
Hello. lt's me.

238
00:40:56,652 --> 00:41:00,197
weren't you supposed to be
going off to Hurley?

239
00:41:03,116 --> 00:41:07,490
Listen, stay where you are.
Call me soon at home.

240
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:23,941
l've come....

241
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,342
l've come for the photographs.

242
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:30,245
How did you manage to find me?

243
00:41:32,392 --> 00:41:34,431
Do you live here?

244
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:25,917
Drink?

245
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:39,543
what's so important
about my bloody pictures?

246
00:42:40,737 --> 00:42:42,777
That's my business.

247
00:42:54,463 --> 00:42:57,365
The light was very beautiful
in the park this morning.

248
00:42:57,535 --> 00:42:59,738
Those shots should be very good.

249
00:43:00,543 --> 00:43:02,233
Anyway, l need them.

250
00:43:06,686 --> 00:43:10,941
My private life's already in a mess.
lt would be a disaster if....

251
00:43:12,541 --> 00:43:14,450
So what?

252
00:43:16,189 --> 00:43:19,505
Nothing like a little disaster
for sorting things out.

253
00:43:29,275 --> 00:43:31,512
Have you ever done any modeling?

254
00:43:31,867 --> 00:43:34,289
Fashion stuff, l mean.

255
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:37,008
You've got it.

256
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,142
Hold that.

257
00:44:00,568 --> 00:44:03,470
Not many girls can stand
as well as that.

258
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:06,326
No, thanks. l'm in a hurry.

259
00:44:08,343 --> 00:44:10,383
You'll get your pictures.

260
00:44:10,551 --> 00:44:11,925
l promise.

261
00:44:12,087 --> 00:44:14,388
l always keep my word.

262
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,073
Come here.

263
00:44:18,806 --> 00:44:20,661
Show me how you sit.

264
00:44:49,363 --> 00:44:51,151
who is it?

265
00:44:53,106 --> 00:44:56,237
Oh, yes. That's right. Hold on a second.

266
00:44:59,314 --> 00:45:01,201
ls it for me?

267
00:45:06,064 --> 00:45:07,625
lt's my wife.

268
00:45:08,944 --> 00:45:10,667
why should l speak to her?

269
00:45:15,568 --> 00:45:18,633
Sorry, love.
The bird l'm with won't talk to you.

270
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,969
She isn't my wife, really.

271
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,971
we just have some kids.

272
00:45:57,415 --> 00:45:58,659
No.

273
00:45:58,823 --> 00:46:01,638
No kids. Not even kids.

274
00:46:03,367 --> 00:46:07,676
Sometimes, though,
it feels as if we had kids.

275
00:46:09,894 --> 00:46:12,382
She isn't beautiful. She's...

276
00:46:13,222 --> 00:46:15,360
...easy to live with.

277
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:21,122
No, she isn't.

278
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:24,323
That's why l don't live with her.

279
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,405
But even with beautiful girls...

280
00:46:53,571 --> 00:46:56,026
...you look at them, and that's that.

281
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:59,745
That's why they always end up by....

282
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,894
And l'm stuck with them all day long.

283
00:47:07,394 --> 00:47:09,914
lt would be the same with men.

284
00:47:14,529 --> 00:47:16,504
Have a listen to this.

285
00:47:30,624 --> 00:47:32,565
No. Keep still. Keep still.

286
00:47:32,735 --> 00:47:34,644
Listen and keep still.

287
00:47:40,671 --> 00:47:42,775
You can smoke if you like.

288
00:47:46,111 --> 00:47:48,445
Slowly. Slowly.

289
00:47:48,606 --> 00:47:50,646
Against the beat.

290
00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:03,131
That's it.

291
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:46,775
l can't stand it.
l'm nervous enough as it is.

292
00:48:51,385 --> 00:48:53,295
Can l have some water?

293
00:49:37,206 --> 00:49:39,988
And l'm not a fool, love.

294
00:49:48,117 --> 00:49:50,505
Can l have the photographs?

295
00:49:50,901 --> 00:49:52,307
Of course.

296
00:49:52,468 --> 00:49:54,192
Later.

297
00:49:57,235 --> 00:49:59,821
Your boyfriend's a bit past it.

298
00:50:06,451 --> 00:50:08,622
why didn't you say what you want?

299
00:50:40,176 --> 00:50:41,866
Get dressed.

300
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,745
l'll cut out the negatives you want.

301
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,146
They'll go.

302
00:52:44,902 --> 00:52:46,626
They're not going.

303
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:53,092
Don't go.

304
00:53:04,709 --> 00:53:06,978
-Have you bought a propeller?
-what?

305
00:53:07,396 --> 00:53:10,046
You bought a propeller
this morning, right?

306
00:53:10,308 --> 00:53:11,933
Oh, yes.

307
00:53:12,388 --> 00:53:14,363
You'll have to give us a hand with it.

308
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:32,666
-All right?
-Fine. Yeah.

309
00:53:36,994 --> 00:53:38,816
what's it for?

310
00:53:38,977 --> 00:53:41,279
Nothing. lt's beautiful.

311
00:53:41,442 --> 00:53:45,086
lf l had a big room like this, l'd hang it
from the ceiling like a fan.

312
00:53:46,465 --> 00:53:49,563
-Do you live on your own?
-No.

313
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:58,847
Perhaps l'll put it there
like a piece of sculpture.

314
00:53:59,168 --> 00:54:02,168
lt'll look good there.
lt'll break up the straight lines.

315
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:25,976
-Are you going?
-lt's late.

316
00:54:26,142 --> 00:54:28,029
Do l see you again?

317
00:54:30,654 --> 00:54:34,679
well, at least tell me your name
or your telephone number.

318
00:55:04,603 --> 00:55:06,391
Thank you.

319
01:03:16,008 --> 01:03:18,790
Hello?
Knightsbridge 1 -239.

320
01:03:20,232 --> 01:03:21,661
what?

321
01:03:22,983 --> 01:03:24,772
No, l'm sorry.

322
01:06:01,274 --> 01:06:02,703
Ron?

323
01:06:03,067 --> 01:06:05,041
Something fantastic's happened.

324
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:08,821
Those photographs
in the park, fantastic!

325
01:06:09,114 --> 01:06:11,764
Somebody was trying to kill
