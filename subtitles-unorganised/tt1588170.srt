00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,400
I saw the father and the nun today at the church.

3
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Well, I've done this often.

4
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,100
I love the kids here.

5
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:33,949
If I have a baby
I should raise him in a place like this.

6
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,542
...because here we have 
wildflowers and trees to see.

7
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:39,237
And it's close to Seoul.

8
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,415
Uh? Tow truck?

9
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:44,216
They said it might take a while to get here.

10
00:03:50,592 --> 00:03:52,823
(hmm) I love hearing your voice now.

11
00:03:53,674 --> 00:03:57,050
Since I can hear your voice and it's snowing,

12
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,335
the ambiance in my car has livened up.

13
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:07,585
Just a second.

14
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,924
Does your tire have an air leak?

15
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,100
Yes, I called a tow truck.

16
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,027
It'll take a long time to get here since it's snowing.

17
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,492
Let me check your tire.

18
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,471
He said he would check the tire.

19
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,076
Really?

20
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,627
I think you should just wait for the tow truck.

21
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,324
Huh? No, it's not hard to
change a tire.

22
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,900
Hmm? It's strange.

23
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,072
You told him you called the tow truck but the guy wants to check your tire.

24
00:04:54,254 --> 00:04:55,721
Wait, wait.

25
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,200
What's the status?

26
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,380
Okay.

27
00:05:02,811 --> 00:05:04,887
Hello? Joo-yeon, I think I should head out now.

28
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:09,858
Don't open the car door and just wait for
the tow truck.

29
00:05:12,284 --> 00:05:13,426
Huh?

30
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:18,948
Wait.

31
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:34,979
"My love...

32
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:38,631
so sweet...

33
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,295
I just..."

34
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:49,416
I, I just don't like him checking the tire
even though you told him you called the tow truck.

35
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,386
...Well, there are people around here.

36
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,322
Ha...I'm sorry, I couldn't be with you for your birthday.

37
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,477
Okay. I'll be there soon.

38
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,352
Um.

39
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,744
Your car's completely sunk.

40
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,892
Thank you for your help but I think I should just wait for the tow truck.

41
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,484
Thank you so much.

42
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,302
Why isn't he leaving?

43
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:32,230
I Saw the Devil

44
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,621
Mister... Mister... Mister...

45
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,529
It's going to be easy since your skin is so soft.

46
00:11:29,215 --> 00:11:32,535
Can you please not kill me?

47
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,165
Why?

48
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,449
I...

49
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,800
have a baby in my belly.

50
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:59,339
Spare my life, please.

51
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:47,258
Dong-soo! Dong-soo!

52
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,059
What?

53
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,699
Come over here! Hurry Up!

54
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,533
Detective! Why did you come out here?

55
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:49,834
We can let you know the situation later if you stay at home.

56
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:54,049
What happened? What happened to my daughter?

57
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,563
Don't look. Not now.

58
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,219
We don't know yet.

59
00:16:31,796 --> 00:16:32,645
Detective Joh.

60
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:34,835
Here.

61
00:16:36,491 --> 00:16:38,030
Is this...?

62
00:16:38,035 --> 00:16:38,982
Let me see.

63
00:16:41,362 --> 00:16:44,304
It looks like hair. Flip it over.

64
00:17:14,063 --> 00:17:15,073
Forensics team!

65
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,745
Here, here! Come here, hurry!

66
00:17:17,377 --> 00:17:20,122
We found it--we found it over here.

67
00:20:03,992 --> 00:20:07,832
...God helped us.

68
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:12,672
Otherwise we wouldn't have been able to find her.

69
00:20:16,701 --> 00:20:20,029
It's funny how the father couldn't protect his own daughter,

70
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:28,031
even though he has been a detective in charge of violent crime for over 30 years.

71
00:20:38,716 --> 00:20:40,097
...Please stop smoking sir.

72
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,750
I'm sorry.

73
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:58,893
I'm really sorry.

74
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:11,604
To you and to my Joo-yeon.

75
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:22,500
I am terribly sorry.

76
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:51,751
I'm sorry, Joo-yeon.

77
00:21:53,283 --> 00:21:55,160
I couldn't keep the promise.

78
00:21:56,652 --> 00:22:01,543
I was late and couldn't keep the promise.

79
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:05,314
But Joo-yeon,

80
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:10,361
I'll promise this:

81
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:20,563
I'll give him pain that's a thousand times--

82
00:22:20,684 --> 00:22:23,420
no--ten thousand times worse.

83
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:32,821
Soo-hyun.

84
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,889
So, how long do you want?

85
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:21,972
Since there's nothing urgent to do, you can rest for a few months.

86
00:23:22,254 --> 00:23:23,588
Two weeks is enough.

87
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,140
You can rest longer.

88
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,012
No, I'll come back to work after two weeks.

89
00:23:30,253 --> 00:23:33,429
Well, I really appreciate it if you can do that.

90
00:23:34,408 --> 00:23:36,266
But are you going to be okay?

91
00:23:45,446 --> 00:23:46,893
...Alright.

92
00:23:47,016 --> 00:23:50,311
Then I'll be expecting you in two weeks.

93
00:23:50,504 --> 00:23:53,132
In the meantime, please rest yourself fully.

94
00:24:00,332 --> 00:24:02,959
I can't believe this happened to us.

95
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:05,301
They just got engaged less than a month ago.

96
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,524
What a crazy world.

97
00:24:17,887 --> 00:24:19,717
You're here.

98
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,500
Here's the GPS,

99
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:28,052
and the capsule.

100
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:31,156
There's a GPS and a voice mic inside here.

101
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:32,676
Isn't it marvelous?

102
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,085
Good job.

103
00:24:39,222 --> 00:24:40,422
Thank you.

104
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,878
You're welcome.

105
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:49,433
Aren't you going in?

106
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:50,222
Yes?

107
00:24:51,148 --> 00:24:53,349
Isn't there anything to say?

108
00:24:53,745 --> 00:24:55,225
No.

109
00:24:56,271 --> 00:25:02,563
Well, I trust you
but if there's going to be any problem,

110
00:25:02,707 --> 00:25:07,189
we could get into serious trouble 
since I siphoned them off from another division.

111
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:08,439
Don't worry.

112
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,369
I'll make sure there's no problem.

113
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:31,302
The police suspect those four.

114
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:37,350
They were the suspects when there were similar cases before.

115
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:42,209
Soo-hyun, you're here.

116
00:25:42,344 --> 00:25:43,700
Yeah.

117
00:25:44,207 --> 00:25:46,860
Do you want to have supper?

118
00:25:47,283 --> 00:25:49,031
No, I have to leave now.

119
00:25:49,946 --> 00:25:51,968
I went grocery shopping for dad.

120
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,760
I'll get going now.

121
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,463
Don't see me off outside.

122
00:25:59,334 --> 00:26:00,035
Are you leaving?

123
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,116
Yes.

124
00:26:25,911 --> 00:26:28,862
Why isn't this bastard moving a single muscle?

125
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:33,922
Yes.

126
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,395
There's no suspicious movement yet.

127
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,648
Yes.

128
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:41,073
Yes sir.

129
00:26:41,373 --> 00:26:43,845
This guy's the dirtiest pervert, I swear.

130
00:28:09,197 --> 00:28:10,479
Quiet.

131
00:28:14,124 --> 00:28:15,561
Do you remember this?

132
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:21,240
You really don't know?

133
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:30,055
I see.

134
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:48,391
Who the fuck is he?

135
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,707
Why does he look so bruised up?

136
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:51,146
Why's he turning himself in?

137
00:28:51,285 --> 00:28:55,358
Two months ago, there was a dead teenage girl's body
in Bang-Ho river--he said he did that girl.

138
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:58,566
He confessed that the missing Shin-Chun high school girl
a few years ago was his job too.

139
00:28:59,664 --> 00:29:01,985
What the hell is wrong with him?

140
00:29:02,136 --> 00:29:03,238
Why does he have so many bruises?

141
00:29:03,389 --> 00:29:05,121
Who did this? Did you guys do it?

142
00:29:05,614 --> 00:29:12,403
No. All of a sudden paramedics came and went upstairs and found him almost dead like this.

143
00:29:12,757 --> 00:29:14,656
Then who did this? He injured himself?

144
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:16,781
He didn't explain that part yet.

145
00:29:17,128 --> 00:29:20,142
What the--hey, what happened to you last night?

146
00:29:28,408 --> 00:29:29,683
What the hell is he saying?

147
00:29:29,813 --> 00:29:35,252
It sounds like some guy hit his penis with a hammer badly.

148
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:38,593
Ahh, that's nonsense.

149
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,134
Hey retard, who hit your penis?

150
00:30:11,301 --> 00:30:13,187
Who the fuck are you?

151
00:30:21,378 --> 00:30:23,350
Hey you motherfucker!

152
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:20,116
There're no more buses at this time of day.

153
00:33:20,794 --> 00:33:22,126
Where are you going?

154
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:23,894
Pardon me?

155
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,856
I said, where are you going?

156
00:33:27,061 --> 00:33:28,273
Sungmin apartment.

157
00:33:28,426 --> 00:33:29,707
Sungmin?

158
00:33:30,652 --> 00:33:34,065
Since it's not too far from here, I can give you a ride.

159
00:33:34,436 --> 00:33:36,230
I can take you there.

160
00:33:36,611 --> 00:33:37,692
No thanks.

161
00:33:38,379 --> 00:33:40,488
I can take you there.

162
00:33:40,658 --> 00:33:41,910
It's okay.

163
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:46,240
Sungmin apartment is very close to here.

164
00:33:55,672 --> 00:33:57,225
It's okay.

165
00:34:01,932 --> 00:34:03,493
Are you sure?

166
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,145
Yeah, it's okay.

167
00:34:07,322 --> 00:34:08,753
Get in the car.

168
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:28,795
What?

169
00:34:29,054 --> 00:34:31,930
Yes? Nothing.

170
00:34:37,925 --> 00:34:39,897
Is this an after-school academic bus?

171
00:35:03,983 --> 00:35:06,052
Where did I leave it?

172
00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:41,042
What?

173
00:35:42,616 --> 00:35:43,924
Yes?

174
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:46,330
Why are you looking so scared?

175
00:35:49,674 --> 00:35:51,353
Haven't you seen this before?

176
00:37:09,024 --> 00:37:10,626
Who are you?

177
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:31,304
By the way, why do you need these to get the insurance money?

178
00:37:31,813 --> 00:37:35,619
First of all, I need to make sure that your son
is my policyholder, Jang Gyeong-chul,

179
00:37:36,138 --> 00:37:37,853
since there are many people with the same name.

180
00:37:39,438 --> 00:37:41,403
These are all old pictures.

181
00:37:51,933 --> 00:37:55,635
Maybe you can recognize him in this picture.

182
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:02,729
I'll ask a few more questions.

183
00:38:03,813 --> 00:38:07,914
Is there any other way to contact him now?

184
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,012
I don't know, but his son might know how to contact him.

185
00:38:13,409 --> 00:38:16,226
Sang-hoon! Sang-hoon!

186
00:38:16,898 --> 00:38:18,517
Where is he?

187
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:27,018
Yangpyeong? Chungpyeong? I think.

188
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:33,398
Lastly, I want to make sure your son is the one that I'm looking for.

189
00:38:38,813 --> 00:38:40,698
Is this Jang Gyeong-chul?

190
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:46,757
He's Gyeong-chul.

191
00:38:47,647 --> 00:38:52,329
Was this picture taken recently?

192
00:38:53,986 --> 00:38:59,510
How come he looks so scary here?

193
00:38:59,866 --> 00:39:02,065
Insurance my ass.

194
00:39:04,692 --> 00:39:07,416
He insured the family?

195
00:39:08,224 --> 00:39:12,012
He left us, and his son, and never came back!

196
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:14,930
Now you think he has an insurance policy on our names?

197
00:39:15,803 --> 00:39:17,815
That's nonsense!

198
00:39:17,953 --> 00:39:18,857
Why are you saying that?

199
00:39:18,987 --> 00:39:23,378
Am I wrong? Do you still think he's our son?

200
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:27,894
He's good for nothing!

201
00:39:28,063 --> 00:39:31,080
Please shut your mouth and snap out of it.

202
00:39:31,223 --> 00:39:32,796
Why are you saying that?

203
00:39:33,557 --> 00:39:35,297
It's not appropriate to say stuff like that.

204
00:39:35,427 --> 00:39:37,090
Fuck, whatever.

205
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:47,154
By the way, if the policyholder is dead or missing,

206
00:39:47,324 --> 00:39:50,819
does his family get the money?

207
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,719
Are you Sang-hoon?

208
00:40:26,482 --> 00:40:28,415
Do you know where your father lives now?

209
00:40:31,874 --> 00:40:37,376
Shit. Why do you ask?

210
00:44:05,472 --> 00:44:07,871
You guys don't go anywhere but home now, alright?

211
00:44:07,991 --> 00:44:08,953
Yes.

212
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,292
Driver, please don't let them out anywhere else.

213
00:44:15,468 --> 00:44:16,092
Yeah.

214
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:17,379
Thank you.

215
00:45:02,972 --> 00:45:04,177
Who are you?

216
00:45:04,306 --> 00:45:05,243
Is Jang Gyeong-chul here?

217
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:07,004
Why do you ask that?

218
00:45:07,124 --> 00:45:08,861
We're police. Where is he?

219
00:45:09,643 --> 00:45:11,280
He's driving our kids to their homes now.

220
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,780
Can you call him right now? Please?

221
00:46:02,956 --> 00:46:04,557
What? One girl is missing?

222
00:46:04,921 --> 00:46:06,596
What were you guys doing?

223
00:46:06,748 --> 00:46:08,455
How come you guys didn't notice Jang Gyeong-chul leaving the house?

224
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,405
You guys were asleep while staking out, right?

225
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,549
How come you guys missed him?

226
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,026
You're reporting back to me that shit happens?

227
00:46:16,504 --> 00:46:17,861
You guys were all at the front of the house, right?

228
00:46:18,521 --> 00:46:19,312
What were you guys doing there?

229
00:46:19,506 --> 00:46:20,702
Did you guys plan to catch him after greeting him?

230
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:22,414
What a bunch of retards.

231
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:23,501
Now listen.

232
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,840
We need to watch every corner of the after-school academy and we must find Jang Gyeong-chul first.

233
00:46:28,354 --> 00:46:29,549
We don't need a fucking warrant.

234
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:32,027
We just gotta catch him, got it?

235
00:46:32,844 --> 00:46:35,447
Mark my words: he is the murderer.

236
00:46:35,575 --> 00:46:37,462
Go catch him!

237
00:46:42,405 --> 00:46:43,269
It's me.

238
00:46:43,728 --> 00:46:47,411
I just got home to get changed but I don't think I have enough time to get changed now.

239
00:46:47,865 --> 00:46:49,486
So...where are you going?

240
00:46:49,648 --> 00:46:50,441
To my friend's place.

241
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,255
Friend? Who?

242
00:46:51,399 --> 00:46:52,531
Do you know any of my friends?

243
00:46:52,742 --> 00:46:53,193
What?

244
00:46:53,346 --> 00:46:55,592
Do you just want to take the clothes or do you want to get changed now?

245
00:46:55,737 --> 00:46:56,714
No, I don't have time.

246
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:57,731
Just give me the clothes.

247
00:46:57,909 --> 00:46:58,717
No, I wasn't talking to you.

248
00:46:59,206 --> 00:47:00,757
Why are you going to a friend's place at this time?

249
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:02,088
To study!

250
00:47:02,628 --> 00:47:04,111
Why are you studying at your friend's place?

251
00:47:04,505 --> 00:47:06,598
Why are you nagging me now?

252
00:47:06,887 --> 00:47:09,932
Are you talking back to me? Come over here!

253
00:47:10,069 --> 00:47:10,771
No!

254
00:47:11,086 --> 00:47:12,225
Look at this girl!

255
00:47:13,517 --> 00:47:15,342
What are you doing now? Hurry up and go.

256
00:47:53,562 --> 00:47:56,142
Let me see.

257
00:48:32,295 --> 00:48:34,952
Ah...your skin is so pale.

258
00:48:40,498 --> 00:48:41,735
It's okay, it's okay.

259
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:44,359
I'll finish it real quick.

260
00:48:46,005 --> 00:48:52,046
It looks like I can't fucking drive the academic bus anymore.

261
00:48:54,576 --> 00:48:56,231
...Things are getting fucking twisted now.

262
00:49:02,176 --> 00:49:06,546
But shit, can't I like you?

263
00:49:08,941 --> 00:49:10,459
I can like you, right?

264
00:49:12,374 --> 00:49:14,045
It's totally okay that I like you.

265
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:19,332
Then why the fuck is the whole world giving me so much shit, huh?

266
00:49:20,397 --> 00:49:21,537
Why is that?

267
00:49:31,721 --> 00:49:37,027
I'll finish it real quick.

268
00:49:52,883 --> 00:49:55,385
Jang Gyeong-chul.

269
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,372
What? Are you alone?

270
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,881
Are you a cop?

271
00:52:07,475 --> 00:52:09,284
I see, you're a cop.

272
00:52:16,117 --> 00:52:18,545
How come the Korean police found me so quickly?

273
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:22,142
I'm so surprised.

274
00:52:26,145 --> 00:52:29,403
I guess you still don't know who I am now.

275
00:52:30,528 --> 00:52:34,500
Well, what do I expect from the Korean police?

276
00:52:36,426 --> 00:52:38,246
That's that.

277
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:29,593
You shithead!

278
00:53:30,766 --> 00:53:32,980
Fuck you!

279
00:56:59,489 --> 00:57:01,699
What, what the hell is this guy?

280
00:57:03,226 --> 00:57:07,599
This guy's a fucking psycho.

281
00:58:04,613 --> 00:58:06,491
Fucking asshole.

282
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:52,488
Hello, sir!

283
00:58:52,706 --> 00:58:57,039
I don't know where you're headed,
but you can take this taxi.

284
00:58:58,258 --> 00:58:59,304
Aren't you getting in?

285
00:58:59,706 --> 00:59:01,096
There're no more taxis at this time.

286
00:59:04,691 --> 00:59:07,898
How come you decided to walk this road alone?

287
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:13,910
Well, you're lucky that you got a taxi here.

288
00:59:15,284 --> 00:59:17,408
The customer in the back seat is heading in the same direction.

289
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:19,305
You're okay going with this gentleman, right?

290
00:59:19,571 --> 00:59:21,146
Sure.

291
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:40,502
Anyway, it must've been really hard for you to catch a taxi.

292
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:44,177
You can hardly see a taxi around here at this time.

293
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,792
I rarely even drive here.

294
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:49,779
Only once in a while, I come here for work.

295
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:54,393
But you gentlemen are so lucky today.

296
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:57,038
You know that?

297
00:59:57,806 --> 01:00:03,310
Recently, there've been so many bad incidents
around this area that I can't get any customers here.

298
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:07,534
But today I have two customers here.

299
01:00:08,542 --> 01:00:11,726
Come to think of it, I'm also lucky today!

300
01:00:11,863 --> 01:00:13,517
Ain't I, sir?

301
01:00:20,465 --> 01:00:23,696
Where were you gentlemen going from such a dark place?

302
01:00:38,832 --> 01:00:43,681
Sir? Did something good happen to you today, sir?

303
01:00:43,844 --> 01:00:45,014
Mister.

304
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:46,416
Yes?

305
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,901
You said we're all lucky today.

306
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,126
That's what I said.

307
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:58,730
Why?

308
01:01:01,128 --> 01:01:06,746
But I think you're so unlucky today.

309
01:02:33,577 --> 01:02:35,782
Crazy retards.

310
01:04:12,593 --> 01:04:14,655
Your bones will be attached soon since you're young.

311
01:04:15,157 --> 01:04:16,941
Don't worry about it.

312
01:04:17,594 --> 01:04:22,899
How did you break your wrist playing soccer?

313
01:04:25,112 --> 01:04:27,345
Did you play with your fists?

314
01:04:27,628 --> 01:04:30,661
Anyway, from now on take it slowly. Got it?

315
01:04:37,383 --> 01:04:38,060
It's done.

316
01:04:38,206 --> 01:04:39,928
You can leave.

317
01:04:43,964 --> 01:04:45,460
Hey, you motherfucker.

318
01:04:49,178 --> 01:04:50,657
Am I your son?

319
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:56,564
Then why do you talk down to me?

320
01:05:02,571 --> 01:05:03,969
Take off your glasses.

321
01:05:06,801 --> 01:05:08,086
Take off your glasses.

322
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:15,821
Come here.

323
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,100
Come over here.

324
01:05:18,231 --> 01:05:22,209
Sir? You can come outside now.

325
01:05:22,353 --> 01:05:24,388
You need to take the prescription.

326
01:05:34,311 --> 01:05:35,604
How old are you?

327
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:40,756
I'm 22.

328
01:05:41,782 --> 01:05:43,026
Must be nice being 22.

329
01:05:44,237 --> 01:05:45,596
Boyfriend?

330
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:47,656
Pardon me?

331
01:05:49,537 --> 01:05:53,143
You look like you have many boyfriends. Right?

332
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:57,107
No. I don't have a boyfriend.

333
01:05:58,642 --> 01:06:00,848
Don't fucking lie to me.

334
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:06,275
How come a cutie like you don't have a boyfriend?

335
01:06:10,475 --> 01:06:12,789
You don't know about 'IT.'

336
01:06:14,682 --> 01:06:16,058
Excuse me?

337
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:19,637
If you don't know about 'IT,' 
then you can hardly know about men.

338
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:44,909
Yesterday I was going to have some fun,
but some asshole spoiled everything.

339
01:07:49,969 --> 01:07:54,363
So this time I want to go smoothly with you.

340
01:08:23,364 --> 01:08:24,819
Take off your clothes.

341
01:08:26,161 --> 01:08:27,453
Huh?

342
01:08:32,837 --> 01:08:35,111
Take off your clothes, yourself.

343
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,657
Since we're going to do it, you should enjoy it too, right?

344
01:08:42,214 --> 01:08:44,210
So take off your clothes.

345
01:09:03,175 --> 01:09:06,673
Take them off before I put scars on your face
with my knife, bitch.

346
01:09:11,650 --> 01:09:14,840
I said, take them off quickly, you bitch.

347
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,461
That's right.

348
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,438
Take off your bra too. Hurry up.

349
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:35,232
Please don't kill me.

350
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:52,005
That's it. Take off your skirt too.

351
01:12:25,581 --> 01:12:26,760
You son of a bitch.

352
01:12:27,416 --> 01:12:31,076
Who the hell are you, you fucking bitch.

353
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:27,875
Wait.

354
01:13:28,876 --> 01:13:30,147
Don't leave now.

355
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,144
I need to treat you immediately.

356
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:36,707
Why are you pretending to be so weak?

357
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:38,452
It's just the beginning.

358
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:43,191
Remember this.

359
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:46,201
It's going to be even more terrible.

360
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,799
Close your eyes now.

361
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,495
Turn around, and cover your ears too.

362
01:15:59,526 --> 01:16:03,750
Hey fuck you, crazy ass motherfucker, shit!

363
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:12,022
Ha! Son of a bitch!

364
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:14,652
You want to do this against me, huh?

365
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,681
Hey, you son of a bitch! You really want to do this?!

366
01:16:17,904 --> 01:16:19,787
Crazy motherfucker.

367
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:25,372
Alright, you fucking shithead, let's see who's the top dog here.

368
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,908
What is it?

369
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,910
Has there been an accident?

370
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,374
Looks like something's wrong with the car.

371
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:16,086
Yes, sir.

372
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:19,887
Is everything okay with you?

373
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:27,757
I'm just worried about you.

374
01:19:29,433 --> 01:19:34,397
The police think that I'm after Jang Gyeong-chul.

375
01:19:36,363 --> 01:19:40,050
It seems like they're also after Jang Gyeong-chul.

376
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:44,892
So I was wondering....

377
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:51,503
if you can stop chasing him now.

378
01:19:51,504 --> 01:19:52,850
But I...

379
01:19:52,989 --> 01:19:54,970
You've done enough.

380
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,067
I want you to stop it.

381
01:19:58,373 --> 01:20:00,223
But, sir...

382
01:20:11,990 --> 01:20:13,991
never mind.

383
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:16,795
I see. I'll hang up.

384
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:21,387
Soo-hyun, it's me.

385
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:24,597
Soo-hyun.

386
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:27,542
Yeah, how are you doing?

387
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,913
How are you doing, Soo-hyun?

388
01:20:30,247 --> 01:20:33,134
I'm just busy with my work now.

389
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:37,499
Really? What kind of work?

390
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,715
You know what I do.

391
01:20:41,338 --> 01:20:45,127
I know what you do normally, but I don't know what you do secretly.

392
01:20:45,512 --> 01:20:47,573
You got the criminal's information from my dad already?

393
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:55,651
Soo-hyun, I understand how you feel, but I want you to stop it.

394
01:20:57,331 --> 01:20:59,996
My sister won't come back, even if you do this.

395
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:07,219
Even if you catch him, nothing changes.

396
01:21:08,725 --> 01:21:13,774
Revenge is something people do in a movie,
but this man is just crazy.

397
01:21:15,332 --> 01:21:18,653
I'm sorry, but I have nothing to tell you.

398
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:21,019
What do you mean you have nothing to tell me?

399
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,323
Am I nobody to you?

400
01:21:26,823 --> 01:21:29,084
Do you know how I have been lately?

401
01:21:29,438 --> 01:21:33,906
Recently, I started checking back a lot
to see if anyone's following me.

402
01:21:36,439 --> 01:21:39,286
Now you tell me you have nothing to tell me?

403
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,846
So I beg you now.

404
01:21:49,645 --> 01:21:52,342
There's no meaning. Please stop it.

405
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,512
I'm sorry, I have to hang up now.

406
01:21:57,513 --> 01:22:02,231
And this work is not meaningless.

407
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,637
Water.

408
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,882
Give me water.

409
01:23:37,349 --> 01:23:41,146
Do you remember the time when we first met each other?

410
01:23:42,566 --> 01:23:47,022
We wanted to organize a terrorist group and flip the world upside down.

411
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:53,259
I miss those days.

412
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,818
We got nothing to be afraid of.

413
01:23:57,149 --> 01:24:00,710
...Talk about this crap later when your mom dies,
just give me a cigar now.

414
01:24:35,344 --> 01:24:38,299
He must be related to one of the dead girls' families.

415
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:40,520
Who the hell would do that, if he's not?

416
01:24:46,568 --> 01:24:49,321
He's joined our club, too.

417
01:24:49,457 --> 01:24:53,820
He's enjoying it--the same way you feel excited
when you're on the hunt.

418
01:24:55,988 --> 01:25:01,000
Catch it, and release it; catch it, and release it.

419
01:25:01,001 --> 01:25:02,994
He's playing the hunting game now.

420
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:12,739
It looks like you got caught really bad this time.

421
01:25:17,005 --> 01:25:21,438
This guy went crazy after losing his bitch.

422
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,709
Monster appeared.

423
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:27,725
It's funny.

424
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:47,613
Go to bed, you must be tired now.

425
01:25:47,725 --> 01:25:49,424
There are a lot of vacant rooms.

426
01:25:49,772 --> 01:25:51,777
You can sleep in any room.

427
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:58,439
And I will prepare breakfast for tomorrow.

428
01:26:15,135 --> 01:26:17,309
Fucking assholes.

429
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:55,209
Let go. Let go of me!

430
01:27:07,753 --> 01:27:09,661
Fuck you, asshole.

431
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,794
Shit, you guys are fucking crazy.

432
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,676
Little bit more, little bit more.

433
01:28:09,300 --> 01:28:11,057
One more time.

434
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,840
He's enjoying it--the same way you feel excited
when you're on the hunt.

435
01:29:00,845 --> 01:29:04,867
Catch it, and release it; catch it, and release it.

436
01:29:04,870 --> 01:29:07,188
He's enjoying seeing his prey in pain.

437
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,499
He's playing the hunting game now.

438
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,786
It's going to be even more terrible.

439
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:29,503
It's fun.

440
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:49,498
Don't do that.

441
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:52,179
Didn't you see Mi-yeon last night?

442
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:58,325
If you resist, it's more painful and takes longer.

443
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,658
It'll be done quickly.

444
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:06,948
So bear with me for a little bit.

445
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:13,593
Then why did you suspect us? Huh?

446
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:17,090
Did we ask for a house or money?

447
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:20,433
We just wanted to stay here for few days, so why'd you guys give us shit!

448
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:24,848
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

449
01:31:29,964 --> 01:31:34,583
You should've said that earlier. Huh!

450
01:31:36,249 --> 01:31:43,515
You retards always do that after shit happens.

451
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:48,565
Wait, wait, the order is arms, legs, and head. Right?

452
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:52,960
Close your eyes. It's better not to see it.

453
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,771
Where is she?

454
01:33:06,725 --> 01:33:08,462
How did you come inside without making any noise?

455
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,453
I have a baby in my belly.

456
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,843
I was curious how you'd look.

457
01:33:54,743 --> 01:33:57,259
I see you don't look like a monster.

458
01:33:59,446 --> 01:34:01,785
Crazy asshole.

459
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,549
The order is arms, legs and head. Right?

460
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,107
I'll do exactly the same as how you guys did.

461
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:18,010
Don't worry about it, I won't do any more than that.

462
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:21,965
You crazy psycho fuckers.

463
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,435
I am actually relieved right now.

464
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:39,067
I was worried that something might've happened to you.

465
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,089
He's Kim Soo-hyun from NIS (National Intelligence Service), right?

466
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:48,882
Do you want to see what he's been up to?

467
01:41:54,850 --> 01:41:56,506
Please make him stop.

468
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,171
You can't become a monster to fight against a monster.

469
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:06,221
You're worried about him too, right?

470
01:42:08,550 --> 01:42:10,032
Where is he now?

471
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:13,677
You should be okay since I treated you immediately.

472
01:42:18,850 --> 01:42:21,871
You know you both slept for 2 days straight?

473
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:26,463
What happened?

474
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:33,288
Why don't you just hand him over to the police?

475
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,835
Not yet.

476
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:39,873
What are you gonna do?

477
01:42:41,850 --> 01:42:49,431
Do you know how it feels to have a huge lump in your chest?

478
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,712
That feeling...

479
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:58,686
I promised something to Joo-yeon.

480
01:42:58,850 --> 01:43:03,394
I will pay back what he's done.

481
01:43:06,044 --> 01:43:07,596
Not yet.

482
01:43:10,850 --> 01:43:12,944
It's still far from the end.

483
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:18,456
Alright. I won't ask you any more.

484
01:43:18,850 --> 01:43:23,803
By the way, the capsule's really good, right? Unless he has constipation...

485
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:33,658
He was knocked out after I gave him one strong shot.

486
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,204
I don't think he'll wake up until tomorrow.

487
01:43:44,850 --> 01:43:49,772
Soo-hyun, you know you look so different now?

488
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:25,768
Hello.

489
01:45:25,890 --> 01:45:28,356
Can I have a painkiller with Dexibuprofen in it?

490
01:45:28,476 --> 01:45:31,500
What? Dexi- what?

491
01:45:31,759 --> 01:45:32,906
Give me the strongest one.

492
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:34,318
Okay.

493
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:39,251
Where are you now?

494
01:45:39,451 --> 01:45:41,252
It looks like you're not around.

495
01:45:41,647 --> 01:45:46,500
Hey, are you listening? Of course you are.

496
01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:50,275
This is really fun! Huh!?

497
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:55,133
I've never had this kind of fun before, my whole life.

498
01:45:57,250 --> 01:46:00,791
Hey... I know who you are.

499
01:46:01,450 --> 01:46:06,546
Your girlfriend was Jang Joo-yeon, lived in Yeonyi county. Right?

500
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:09,841
Am I correct?

501
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,992
I want you to know that you made a mistake.

502
01:46:14,850 --> 01:46:17,051
You underestimated me.

503
01:46:17,850 --> 01:46:20,749
You'll regret that you didn't kill me when you had a chance.

504
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,098
It doesn't even take much time to kill someone.

505
01:46:23,187 --> 01:46:24,093
Hello?

506
01:46:24,513 --> 01:46:29,630
You'll see. I'll teach you how pain really feels.

507
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:34,484
Hey, excuse me!

508
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:47,200
By the way, before I killed her, she told me that she was pregnant

509
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:50,509
and begged for her life.

510
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:55,253
Did you know that?

511
01:47:03,300 --> 01:47:05,965
Hu, hu, hu, hu, hurry up you asshole.

512
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,105
Otherwise, that woman will die.

513
01:47:09,850 --> 01:47:13,489
You should've been around me, since you let me stay alive.

514
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:59,102
Jang Gyeong-chul. Where did you go?

515
01:50:22,781 --> 01:50:27,024
Shit, do we have to do this to save them?

516
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:32,900
Sometimes when I look at assholes like them, I don't want to be a human.

517
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:36,066
Call me when they wake up.

518
01:50:42,528 --> 01:50:45,314
What is this again?

519
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:48,013
So what?

520
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:55,473
Really? Is that for real?

521
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:59,609
I got it.

522
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,713
Hey, Jang Gyeong-chul is turning himself in.

523
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:08,476
You son of a bitch, you made a mistake.

524
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:03,607
Wake up.

525
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:16,563
I want to ask you something.

526
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:20,991
Where would your friend go?

527
01:52:32,250 --> 01:52:37,694
You shouldn't have got on his nerves.

528
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:43,790
He pays back what he gets.

529
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:48,341
Do you know what I mean?

530
01:52:50,936 --> 01:52:56,354
Your girl, your girl's family, huh?

531
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:05,719
After that, if he turns himself in, it's all done.

532
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:15,190
But your girl must've not felt so bad.

533
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:24,506
Unlike me, he gives pleasure before he gives pain.

534
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:31,250
He gives pleasure first.

535
01:53:33,700 --> 01:53:38,784
Funny? Is that really funny?

536
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:43,049
That really makes you smile?

537
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:57,847
Alright, I'll make you smile for the rest of your life.

538
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:05,908
I wiretapped a call from Jang Gyeong-chul.

539
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:09,646
I was wiretapping the police communication because I was worried about you.

540
01:54:10,100 --> 01:54:13,465
Just a few moments ago, Jang Gyeong-chul called the police,
saying he wants to turn himself in.

541
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:16,839
But before he does that, he said he wants to finish some business.

542
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,490
Is he gonna do it again?

543
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:20,940
What location did you wiretap the call from?

544
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:22,803
Yeonyi County.

545
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,189
Detective Joh?

546
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:15,171
This is Kim Soo-hyun.

547
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:16,836
What?

548
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:20,689
Why did you make things worse and let this happen?

549
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:26,925
You're a dead man if anything happens to him. Got it!?

550
01:55:27,450 --> 01:55:29,839
Fucking answer me!

551
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:40,000
Tell the other teams to go to Detective Jang's place, and turn the car around. Hurry up!

552
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,650
Look alike?

553
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:43,450
No.

554
01:57:43,452 --> 01:57:46,916
Joo-yeon must take after her mom.

555
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:51,388
Thank god she doesn't take after her dad.

556
01:57:55,450 --> 01:57:58,890
Then why did you charge toward me like crazy?

557
01:57:58,900 --> 01:58:01,795
Are you crazy? Crazy?

558
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,100
Let me see.

559
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:09,979
Shit, where is it?

560
01:58:10,889 --> 01:58:15,344
What would make that motherfucker get angry?

561
01:58:16,250 --> 01:58:18,130
Would he get mad if I do this?

562
01:58:18,406 --> 01:58:22,753
Like this? Like this? Like this?

563
01:58:23,302 --> 01:58:30,210
Like this, crazy motherfucker,
like this, you son of a bitch.

564
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:28,780
Dad, I'm home.

565
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:27,690
You can't come inside here.

566
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:29,788
You can't.

567
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:40,981
What is it?

568
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:44,075
Let go of him.

569
02:00:44,600 --> 02:00:48,579
Are you Kim Soo-hyun?

570
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:54,307
You bastard!

571
02:00:54,443 --> 02:00:55,495
Come over here!

572
02:00:55,500 --> 02:01:00,495
Do you have any idea what you've done? How dare you show up here!

573
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:03,195
You worthless, crazy...

574
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:06,800
Let go. Let go of me.

575
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:14,000
What a ruthless bastard.

576
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:18,695
Stay out of the way.

577
02:01:18,700 --> 02:01:20,777
Out of the way.

578
02:03:03,600 --> 02:03:04,795
Hello?

579
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:07,007
This is Jang Gyeong-chul.

580
02:03:07,700 --> 02:03:10,218
You bastard.

581
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,857
Where are you now?

582
02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:18,490
You, you didn't do anything to Sae-yeon. Right?

583
02:03:18,600 --> 02:03:21,425
You can find out later.

584
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,618
What?

585
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:37,604
Here.

586
02:03:53,550 --> 02:03:54,751
Hello.

587
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,432
How do you feel? Can you feel it now?

588
02:04:07,900 --> 02:04:13,271
Why did you fucking start chasing me, you ignorant fucking asshole.

589
02:04:13,900 --> 02:04:15,882
Who do you think won?

590
02:04:16,850 --> 02:04:20,077
You, or me?

591
02:05:46,950 --> 02:05:49,459
Jang Gyeong-chul, Jang Gyeong-chul!

592
02:05:49,978 --> 02:05:52,067
Jang Gyeong-chul showed up!

593
02:05:52,648 --> 02:05:54,846
Wait for my command.

594
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,842
Now!

595
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:04,833
Hurry up!

596
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:11,440
Stop that car! Stop it!

597
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:16,134
Catch him!

598
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:28,255
Catch him! Catch him!

599
02:07:33,700 --> 02:07:35,670
Hey!

600
02:08:47,100 --> 02:08:50,034
Yes, you're right.

601
02:08:52,100 --> 02:08:54,558
I was wrong.

602
02:09:00,850 --> 02:09:04,362
I underestimated you.

603
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:21,887
From now on, I won't go easy on you.

604
02:09:27,953 --> 02:09:29,723
You son of a bitch, what are you doing?

605
02:09:29,851 --> 02:09:34,153
What are you doing?

606
02:09:34,750 --> 02:09:36,595
It's just the beginning.

607
02:09:36,600 --> 02:09:38,881
Why cry like a baby already?

608
02:09:41,413 --> 02:09:43,783
You son of a bitch.

609
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:46,968
Son of a bitch, kill me already.

610
02:09:47,146 --> 02:09:49,055
Kill me already, son of a bitch.

611
02:09:49,329 --> 02:09:51,140
Kill me now, bitch!

612
02:09:52,302 --> 02:09:54,557
Son of a bitch. Kill me already.

613
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:59,344
Kill me already, son of a bitch. Kill me already!

614
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:11,696
No. Not yet. Wait more.

615
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:20,079
Think about it. If I were going to kill you, I would've already killed you before.

616
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:26,142
I'll kill you when you are in the most pain.

617
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:35,089
When you're in the most pain, shivering out of fear--
then, I will kill you.

618
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:47,775
That's a real revenge.
A real, complete revenge.

619
02:10:56,700 --> 02:10:59,994
Spare, spare my life.

620
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:10,069
Spare, spare, spare, spare my life.

621
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:23,999
You heard that a lot, right? "Spare my life."

622
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,559
You must've enjoyed hearing that a lot.

623
02:11:31,435 --> 02:11:36,595
Spare my life. Spare my life.

624
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:49,139
I'll get punished.

625
02:11:51,500 --> 02:12:02,563
So, so spare my life, I've already had enough.

626
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:11,841
Since I've already had enough, stop it.

627
02:12:25,200 --> 02:12:30,522
Please, please spare my life.

628
02:12:31,450 --> 02:12:37,638
I'm really sorry.

629
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:53,202
Please, please spare my life.

630
02:13:10,500 --> 02:13:15,826
Are you scared?

631
02:13:17,450 --> 02:13:23,145
Tell me, now. Are you scared?

632
02:13:26,450 --> 02:13:34,049
Do you realize what you did now?

633
02:13:55,200 --> 02:14:04,309
You've played with me enough,
so stop it, son of a bitch.

634
02:14:08,500 --> 02:14:14,727
Hey...stop talking bullshit now.

635
02:14:17,200 --> 02:14:22,240
You lost already.

636
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:28,213
You think you've played with me till now.

637
02:14:30,600 --> 02:14:33,709
Bullshit.

638
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:46,703
I don't know what pain is.
Fear? Don't know that either.

639
02:14:48,100 --> 02:14:54,706
There's nothing you can get out of me.

640
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:10,051
So...you already lost.

641
02:15:10,100 --> 02:15:13,449
You know that?

642
02:15:42,350 --> 02:15:50,656
I wish you'd still feel pain after you die.

643
02:17:36,300 --> 02:17:37,950
Son of a bitch!

644
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:41,950
Fucking asshole, you're dead!

645
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:46,595
Crazy bitch! I'll stay alive. I'll fucking stay alive.

646
02:17:46,600 --> 02:17:49,900
You son of a bitch, I will stay alive.

647
02:17:50,150 --> 02:17:53,000
Hey, crazy, can you hear me?

648
02:17:53,150 --> 02:17:54,445
Are you listening to me?

649
02:17:54,450 --> 02:17:57,329
I am afraid of nothing.

650
02:18:00,700 --> 02:18:05,384
You crazy bitch. You think I'm bullshitting, right?

651
02:18:12,150 --> 02:18:17,313
Dad. Dad.

652
02:18:20,700 --> 02:18:25,950
Hey. Hey! Don't open the door!

653
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,774
Dad!

654
02:18:31,332 --> 02:18:35,500
No, no, don't open the door!

655
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,950
Sang-hoon! Don't open the door.

656
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:43,850
What the hell is he doing over there? Stay out of it.

657
02:18:44,500 --> 02:18:46,300
Don't open the door!

658
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:50,990
How come it's not opening?

659
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:55,054
No, no, fuck, why did you come here!?

660
02:18:55,800 --> 02:18:56,895
Mom.
