1
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:51,287
- What time is it, hon?
- It's early, you should be asleep.

2
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,077
I told you to wake me.

3
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,878
You have to rest, for both of you.

4
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,459
I love you.

5
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,587
I love you too.

6
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,551
Wait till Daddy comes home, okay?

7
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,876
I'll bring him back.

8
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,619
Okay, listen up.

9
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,503
Our target is Tama Riyadi.

10
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,006
I'm sure most of you know
who I'm talking about.

11
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,043
This man has become something
of a legend in the unerworld.

12
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:35,592
Pushers, gangs, killers,
they all respect him like a god.

13
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,805
For the past 10 years his building
has been a no-go zone for police.

14
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:45,234
I don't care how big he is or who
is behind him, he must be stopped.

15
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,692
That enterprising fuck's been renting
out rooms like it's an apartment.

16
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:52,199
To any low-life piece of shit
looking to keep his head down.

17
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,282
Our mission is simple.

18
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,618
We go in, and we take him out!

19
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,657
Yes, sir!

20
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,417
Now, Tama isn't alone in this.

21
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,874
Intelligence reports
of an in-house narcotics lab.

22
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,215
This means he has more than enough
muscle to protect his investment.

23
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,681
He also has two trusted guards.

24
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,930
One, a fucking mad dog.

25
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,814
A maniac of feet and fists that
would tear down walls for his boss.

26
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,606
The other, Andi.

27
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,440
The brains of Tama's business.

28
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:34,154
He keeps Mad Dog in check,
but don't be fooled.

29
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,487
Given the opportunity,
he will put bullets in you.

30
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,762
Watch this for me, I'll be right back.

31
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,788
Now, where were we?

32
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,676
Focus at all times.

33
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,882
We take the place floor by floor.

34
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,969
Silence every spotter,
secure every corner.

35
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:26,308
Why us? Why today?

36
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,521
Why the fuck not?

37
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,524
It's a valid question.

38
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,685
And ifs a valid answer, boy.

39
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:35,570
Are you done?

40
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,033
Can I continue?

41
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,532
This won't be the first time
the place has come under fire.

42
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,452
For years rival gangs
have tried to take over his patch.

43
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,913
But each and every one of them
has failed.

44
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,627
Be alert.

45
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,293
We are dealing with a force
ready and willing to fight.

46
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,504
Thirty seconds!

47
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,558
Gear up.

48
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,606
I don't want to see any empty seats
on this truck when we're done.

49
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,909
Now let's clean up this fucking city.

50
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,863
- Morning, lieutenant.
- Good morning.

51
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,774
Who are they?

52
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:07,447
Newly assigned to my unit,
don't worry, they won't get in our way.

53
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,081
You do realize why we're here.

54
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,830
Lieutenant, we have a lot
of space to secure.

55
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,712
We need the extra numbers.

56
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:20,425
And a lot of potential fuck ups
by kids who aren't ready.

57
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,961
This isn't the most ideal
training ground, Jaka.

58
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,927
I'll keep them back.

59
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,343
Further, much fucking further back.

60
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,132
Split teams.
I lead my unit to section B-3.

61
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,394
Your unit flanks
and clears the target.

62
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,026
Lieutenant Wahyu, you're on me.

63
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,727
Take him out.

64
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,203
B-3 clear.

65
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,755
Okay, let's move.

66
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,229
Shut your mouth and move.

67
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,531
What the fuck is going on?

68
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,817
I have to get upstairs.

69
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,904
I don't give a shit
where you need to go.

70
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,199
I have <i>a</i> sick wife alone up there.
She needs her medication.

71
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,663
- I'm sorry but I have to go.
- Are you deaf?

72
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,250
One more step and
<i>I'll</i> fucking end you.

73
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,835
What the fuck?

74
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,545
That's enough.

75
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,009
Bows, drop it.

76
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,136
You wanna play hero?!

77
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:59,978
Go ahead, just stay
the fuck away from me.

78
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,397
- What room are you staying at?
-726.

79
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,902
Relax.
We'll get you to your room soon.

80
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,159
For now I need you to stay back
with me, until this area is safe.

81
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,945
And who's going to keep
it safe for my wife?

82
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:20,115
Sir, I understand your concern.
But you have to remain calm.

83
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,876
- This is bullshit.
- Listen.

84
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:26,129
You don't have much of a choice.
You're either with me...

85
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,755
...or with him.

86
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,131
Okay, everyone.

87
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,376
We're going in.

88
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,129
You keep on him like fucking glue.

89
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,927
Clear!

90
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,233
Tie him!

91
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,821
Motherfucker!

92
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,750
Don't move!

93
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,715
Don't do anything stupid.

94
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,760
Don't move an inch.

95
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,691
Good.

96
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,445
Now...

97
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,363
Wait!

98
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,178
Police!

99
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,943
- What the fuck was that?
- Necessity.

100
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,074
Sergeant!

101
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,235
We've got another spotter!

102
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,404
Motherfucker!

103
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,419
Police!

104
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,776
We have company.

105
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,410
They're here.

106
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:20,499
Cut all communications
and lock it down.

107
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:24,252
I'll call the neighbors.

108
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,810
We have visitors.
You know what to do.

109
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,426
<i>I'll</i> take the one on the left,
you take the one on the right.

110
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,220
Now.

111
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,188
Stop! Let him scream.

112
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,563
Exterior secured.

113
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:25,582
Last night was the worst fucking
game I've ever seen.

114
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,750
You didn't miss much,
I saw the whole thing.

115
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,466
I don't know
what they were thinking--

116
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,578
Help me, please!
They're coming to kill me!

117
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,748
- Don't move!
- You gotta help me, please!

118
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,257
Stop!

119
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,181
Fifth ﬂoor secure.

120
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,743
Hold the line!

121
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,653
Find out what is going on
down there.

122
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,447
Lieutenant, stay on me.

123
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,257
Rama, leave him.
Return to your position.

124
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:56,468
Vehicle 1, Vehicle 1.
This is Jake. Come in.

125
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:04,643
All units, this is Jaka.
Come in.

126
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,527
They're all dead.

127
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,737
<i>Good morning, everyone!</i>

128
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:21,077
<i>You may have noticed we have
some guests trawling the halls today.</i>

129
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:27,754
<i>Now I certainly did not invite them, and
they most certainly are not welcome.</i>

130
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,583
<i>So in the interests of public health...</i>

131
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:36,846
<i>...should you help rid this building
of its recent infestation...</i>

132
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:41,509
...well, then you can consider
yourself a permanent resident.

133
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,894
<i>Free of charge.</i>

134
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:49,105
<i>You'll find these fucking
cockroaches on the sixth ﬂoor.</i>

135
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,189
<i>Now go to work.</i>

136
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:56,233
And please, enjoy yourself.

137
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,663
Lieutenant, put a call in,
we need backup.

138
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,285
We can handle this.

139
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:08,169
With all due respect, sir, they'll burn
us along with the truck if we stay here.

140
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,624
Now make the call.

141
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,589
- I just can't.
- What do you mean, you can't?

142
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,045
We're not, this isn't...

143
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,309
Who else knows we're here?

144
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,647
What the fuck have you
brought us into, lieutenant?

145
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,060
We're alone here.

146
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,242
Sergeant!

147
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,543
Stay put.

148
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,604
Wait!

149
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,680
Everyone fall back!

150
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,260
Move!

151
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,285
- What the fuck have you done now?
- Come here.

152
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,254
See for yourself.

153
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,346
Are you out of your fucking mind?

154
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:15,974
Watch your mouth, boy.

155
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,644
It's all under control. I got this.

156
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,904
Then tell me, genius...

157
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,315
...what happens when
they send in reinforcements.

158
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,951
You don't shoot cops.
You buy them!

159
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,954
Yeah, because they look like all
they want is a fucking check.

160
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:35,459
There won't be any reinforcements,
there won't be any repercussions.

161
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:39,918
This is no different from one
of our rivals getting torn to pieces.

162
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:45,591
Once we're done, there won't
be any evidence left behind.

163
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,756
What makes you so sure?

164
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,600
Because I know who's behind this.

165
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:55,722
That quaking old fuck.

166
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:59,150
And I got him right where I want him.

167
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:02,789
- Fall back. Hanggi, open the door.
- Yes sir!

168
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,388
- Clear!
- Clear!

169
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,973
Keep the door shut.

170
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,162
No, wait!

171
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,583
Fuck!

172
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,669
We have to get out of this place.

173
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,150
Alee, the axe!

174
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,252
Sergeant!

175
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,732
Follow me.

176
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,734
Jaka!

177
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,778
Wait!

178
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:29,068
They're coming!

179
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,786
Bows, the axe!

180
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,425
Get me the fuck out of here!

181
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,719
Alee, help!

182
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,227
Dag“!

183
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,501
Once I pop this, turn it around.
One, two, three!

184
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,719
What the fuck was that?

185
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:22,848
Looks like we just learned
what we're dealing with.

186
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,388
What's the damage?

187
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,104
It's pretty contained, I'd guess
we've lost no more than two rooms.

188
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,020
That's not bad.

189
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,151
Around 30 tenants
who once paid us rent...

190
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,312
...are now spread
across the fucking walls.

191
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:40,274
Check which rooms they stayed in.

192
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,776
Clean out their stashes.

193
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,865
They can cover the damage.

194
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:53,538
Both of you get down there.
I want this situation under control.

195
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,674
<i>Yes, boss.</i>

196
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,955
You take the stairs and I'll take the lift.

197
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,836
We'll meet at the seventh ﬂoor.

198
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,793
Tomy, Angga, go with him.

199
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,298
I'm fine alone.

200
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:27,380
Go with him.

201
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,006
They're going-

202
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,723
Fine.

203
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,680
- Where are we going?
- Room 726, he lives here.

204
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,691
- No.
- Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

205
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:52,024
- Don't fucking leave me with that guy.
- He's not one of them.

206
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:55,566
If that bastard cuts me,
I swear to God I'll fucking haunt you.

207
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,359
I can live with that.

208
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,790
Leave it.

209
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,411
Up. Two ﬂoors.

210
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,291
Open the door!

211
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,134
Open the door!

212
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:47,381
I have an injured man here.
If you don't open up, we're dead.

213
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,677
Don't do it, don't get involved.

214
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,446
Please, they're close.

215
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,111
I'm begging you, look at me.

216
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,162
Open the door.

217
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,789
Please.

218
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,618
You can't turn your back on us.

219
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:17,910
Now open the door.

220
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,188
Start from there.

221
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,067
This way.

222
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,571
Wait.

223
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,120
What the fuck is going on?

224
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:40,744
Shut the fuck up or I'll bleed you.

225
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,457
Check everything and every corner.

226
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,751
Don't leave anything to chance.

227
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:52,764
- You hiding anyone here, friend?
- No, I swear it.

228
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,300
You wouldn't be lying
to me now, would you'?

229
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,969
I got no time for liars.

230
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:02,107
Puts me in a bad mood.

231
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:07,567
When I'm in a bad mood,
I tend to lash out.

232
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:12,609
- I promise, I'm telling you the truth.
- We'll see.

233
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,163
What's this?

234
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,974
- No, please don't.
- Hey, stop, goddamn it!

235
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,226
This is all I got, you fucking punks!

236
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,603
Fuck you! Leave us alone!

237
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,190
I'm getting real tired of your shit.

238
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:30,104
Look around you, there's no one
here, you've ruined my home.

239
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:34,524
- Don't fucking question me, friend.
- I told you the truth. Leave us alone.

240
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,062
You want me to slice that bitch up?

241
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:14,151
Well, do you?

242
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,111
Then sit down!

243
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,651
Okay, let's go.

244
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:56,611
Quick, I need a knife
or something sharp.

245
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,665
You're gonna be okay.
But you have to stay calm.

246
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,925
I just gotta patch you up
Hold on, focus-.

247
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,376
All I have is this.

248
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,138
Fuck you, look again.

249
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:26,640
I swear it's all I got.

250
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,851
What about a spoon?
Or some chopsticks?

251
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,856
Fuck it, just do it.

252
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,524
Why?

253
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,869
What the fuck are you doing?

254
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:16,295
You have to tell me all
I need to know about this place.

255
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:19,294
Anything I can use to help
get him out of here.

256
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:25,339
I wish I could, but the truth is Tama
has this place completely in control.

257
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,632
Even if you find a spot
away from his cameras...

258
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,425
...you'll be trapped in the corridors.

259
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:32,892
There's no escape route.
No passage you can take.

260
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:37,229
If you make it, it will be
the same way you came.

261
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,519
You have to break your way out.

262
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:43,030
You should be careful.

263
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:46,068
You're not here to do good.

264
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,405
Don't be blind.

265
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:50,321
I've seen that old man here before.

266
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,913
He knows this building
as well as I do.

267
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:56,585
Not every cop
is swayed by money, sir.

268
00:49:56,744 --> 00:50:01,671
If I believed that, I would
never have opened the door.

269
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:16,772
He's boneheaded and stubborn.

270
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:19,521
But he's a good man.

271
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:24,655
Take care of him,
I'll be back as soon as I can.

272
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,314
Man, that's too much!

273
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,067
He's here!

274
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,523
Up]

275
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,392
Take the leg!

276
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:10,459
Where'd he come from?

277
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:19,520
Stop it! Calm down!

278
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,531
What the fuck are you doing here?

279
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:41,463
Keep watch.

280
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,734
They're gone.

281
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,989
We don't know that yet.

282
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:14,910
Think about it, Jake,
one's a cripple, the other a rookie.

283
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,952
They didn't stand a chance.

284
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:21,840
Now, I'm sorry, but we're not going
up there just to find their dead bodies.

285
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:27,137
Listen to me, you prick.

286
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:31,892
When it comes to the lives of my men,
it'd be wise for you to shut the fuck up.

287
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:34,470
You wanna talk about risking lives?

288
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,764
Well, you already risked theirs.

289
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:39,646
And now I own yours.

290
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,309
Who ordered this?

291
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,023
What?

292
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,904
Well, it sure as shit wasn't you.

293
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:49,284
No one leads the charge when
it comes to their own dirty work.

294
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,537
Careful, Jaka.

295
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:54,706
Remember your rank.

296
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:55,912
Rank?

297
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:58,168
Rank counts for shit now.

298
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:00,294
Once we make it out of here...

299
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:05,210
...you'll be mopping up puddles of piss
in a prison cell for the rest of your life.

300
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:08,549
We're not hereto do good.

301
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:12,015
We're here to make someone rich.

302
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:17,188
I'm asking you one last time,
who ordered this hit?

303
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:24,111
Another time maybe.
I'll take my chances here first.

304
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,533
Suit yourself.

305
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:37,416
We're going back up there.
We're going to find them.

306
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:40,457
And only then do we leave.

307
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:43,247
Any objections?

308
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:48,465
Thought not.

309
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:51,304
Everyone ready.

310
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,759
Move.

311
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:21,664
Protect him!

312
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,749
Now!

313
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,007
I've never really liked using these.

314
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,471
Takes away the rush.

315
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:05,473
Squeezing <i>a</i> trigger...

316
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,350
...it's like ordering takeout.

317
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:10,732
Now this.

318
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:14,277
This is the thing.

319
01:02:16,024 --> 01:02:18,152
This is the pulse.

320
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,701
This is what I do.

321
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:24,721
You shouldn't be here.

322
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:30,056
Nor should you.

323
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:36,273
Who are they?

324
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:44,237
They're no one.

325
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,866
Don't they check for links
before they send you?

326
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:57,378
They got nothing on record
about you, just your first name.

327
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,714
No one knows shit about us.

328
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,303
I almost fucking choked when they
pinned your photo on the board.

329
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:08,974
Six years with no contact,
and this is how I find you.

330
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:17,436
You have to leave this place.

331
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:19,692
Now.

332
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:21,861
I can't.

333
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:23,487
Not without my team.

334
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,899
- What?
- You heard me.

335
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:28,363
I don't think you realize
the situation you're in.

336
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:31,871
Oh, I understand fine.
I'm not the one living here.

337
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:35,037
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

338
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,204
Next time you want to talk,
just pick up the phone.

339
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:41,999
I spent the last 24 hours listening to
my best friends talk about killing you.

340
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:44,543
I'm the only one who can get
you out of here safely.

341
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,382
Without handcuffs
around your wrists.

342
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:48,512
Wait, what's that?

343
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,765
You're getting me out?

344
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:54,303
You need saving. Last I checked my
guys are almost done collecting these.

345
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:57,769
- Fuck you, just do what I say.
- And go where? Home?

346
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:02,982
If I was such a disappointment
to him then...

347
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:09,029
...think how proud he's gonna be
now that I am who I am.

348
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:15,707
He just wants you home,
we all do.

349
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:23,294
You don't get it.

350
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:28,671
That ain't me anymore. This is.

351
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:34,093
Just because you see what I do as
wrong doesn't mean I can't be good at it.

352
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:36,057
This is the one thing
I know how to do.

353
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:38,313
I fucking own it.

354
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:41,232
No, Rama.

355
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:45,107
I won't go back to who I was.

356
01:07:57,115 --> 01:07:58,708
You're going to be an uncle.

357
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:04,418
What?

358
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:08,586
Yeah, a boy, due in two months.

359
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:21,307
You tell me this now,
because you expect me to leave.

360
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:23,520
I told you because
you're my fucking brother.

361
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:25,481
Think about what you're doing!

362
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:28,897
If you stay here you'll be fucking
dead before that boy is born.

363
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:30,531
Haven't you thought about that?

364
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:33,990
I've thought about it every day
since I was given this assignment.

365
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:36,029
And it fucking terrifies me.

366
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,746
This is fucking ridiculous.

367
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:50,009
You should leave,
I don't have much time.

368
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:54,138
At least change your clothing
before you go back out there.

369
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:59,094
No, this fits me just fine.

370
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:13,527
Hang back, till the area is clear.

371
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:35,505
Wait! Hold the lift.

372
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:50,604
- Where are your men?
- Still hunting. And yours?

373
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,480
Same.

374
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:56,780
- Where are you taking him?
- The boss.

375
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:08,296
That's not the guy.

376
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:12,133
- It is.
- No, it definitely isn't.

377
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,293
Plus this guy is dead already.

378
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:16,804
Yeah, well, I'm taking him anyway.

379
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:19,512
What have you got?

380
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:16,481
Rama.

381
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:18,069
Get in.

382
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:28,576
'%'here's Bows?

383
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:30,370
He's safe.

384
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:36,085
- We lost the sergeant.
- They got him, he's dead.

385
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:40,923
Motherfucker dragged him
across the floor like an animal.

386
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:45,302
What happened?
Why did you split up?

387
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:48,813
We were ambushed, outnumbered.

388
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,769
And he ran.

389
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,734
Sergeant ordered me to protect him.

390
01:11:55,603 --> 01:12:00,029
Right now all we can do
is try to survive this.

391
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:01,568
We have to move soon and fast.

392
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,788
You've been the cause of every
drop of blood spilt in this place.

393
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:09,326
But not now. Now you're gonna
be with us step by step.

394
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:10,960
Blow for blow.

395
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:12,461
Until this nightmare is over.

396
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:16,007
Then what?

397
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,167
We go up. We attack.

398
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:22,430
We get who we came here for
and we use him to get out.

399
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:24,928
Finding him won't be easy.

400
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:26,433
The fifteenth ﬂoor.

401
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:29,805
It's where he runs everything.

402
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:33,934
But reaching him
is another thing entirely.

403
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,852
And assuming we do get him...

404
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,986
...what then? What's your plan?

405
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:39,567
We'll convince him.

406
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:41,444
How?

407
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:43,530
Men change with a gun to the head.

408
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:44,740
We don't have a gun.

409
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:47,200
A knife, <i>a</i> chair leg,
your bare hands, anything.

410
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,331
Just do whatever it takes
to make him ours.

411
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,333
We still have time,
we can still get out.

412
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,167
Who the fuck is that?

413
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:02,629
I told him it's the wrong guy.

414
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:07,392
He's wearing a vest, he counts. I'm not
the one who came back empty-handed.

415
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:10,394
That's not true, is it, Andi?

416
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:13,181
Excuse me.

417
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:20,196
Surely you've got something to show.

418
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:24,943
You of all people wouldn't waste
my fucking time for nothing.

419
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:28,529
I'm sorry, I don't.

420
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,992
Show me your hands.

421
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:37,668
Bring them here.

422
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:39,582
- What?
- Here.

423
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,137
Empty'

424
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:57,142
But I'm sure you have something.
Turn them.

425
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:10,321
I was wrong.

426
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:12,957
You did waste my fucking time.

427
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:18,914
I found dead bodies,
there's a lot of them.

428
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,253
Oh, yeah? What else?

429
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:24,885
If I had to guess, I'd say there
are two more cops out there.

430
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:28,464
What if I said there are three cops left,
would you agree?

431
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:33,262
As I said, there's a lot of floors.
You could give or take.

432
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,439
Give or take...

433
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:47,571
You little prick.

434
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:52,075
<i>I'll</i> admit it, I was impressed,
I really was.

435
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:55,742
But never underestimate
the persistence of paranoia.

436
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:07,387
After seeing that, I'd have
sat still with shit in my pants.

437
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:13,309
Seems these monitors
are the only truth I got left.

438
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:18,811
They never lie, they tell me
everything I need to know.

439
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,768
But there's one thing
I wanted to ask.

440
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:24,608
Why?

441
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,489
Ballsy move like that...

442
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:32,111
...ain't from no clash of conscience.

443
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:34,159
No, there's more to this.

444
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:39,623
Then I think, it doesn't matter because
you're going to die soon anyway.

445
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:42,755
I don't really give a shit
about "why" anymore.

446
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:46,008
No, what I want to know is...

447
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:51,469
...who is this little cunt
that's been tearing my place up?

448
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:55,851
And what would it mean for you...

449
01:15:56,635 --> 01:16:01,061
...if you were to die in front of him?

450
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:06,024
Or better yet, for him to be
cut open in front of you!

451
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,195
Fuck you.

452
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:27,378
Hurry!

453
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:53,532
Don't move!

454
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:55,538
Drop the gun.

455
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:00,710
Are we gonna play this game now?

456
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:02,371
Get over here.

457
01:24:03,664 --> 01:24:05,382
Faster!

458
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:10,095
Did I do something wrong, officer?

459
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:13,508
Shut the fuck up!
Put your hands in the air!

460
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:19,059
Dagu, tie him.

461
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:41,327
Now you're going to get me
the fuck out of here.

462
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:48,921
Amazing.

463
01:30:20,457 --> 01:30:22,380
Wahyu, what the hell are you doing?
Dagu?

464
01:30:23,168 --> 01:30:24,260
He didn't make it.

465
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:28,637
Fuck, you motherfucker! Why?

466
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:32,177
Save it. We're almost done here.

467
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:35,223
Just one last thing to clean up.

468
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:37,641
- You'll never get out of here.
- Shut up!

469
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:41,232
Did you honestly think
it would be that easy to get in'?

470
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:43,817
Did you think we were
that fucking stupid?

471
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:47,234
I was waiting for you,
we all were.

472
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,698
Ready to pick you off one by one.

473
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:52,284
Didn't work too well, did it?

474
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:57,499
Oh, I don't know,
you got at least 18 dead.

475
01:30:57,661 --> 01:30:59,413
No transportation.

476
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:01,627
You're stuck here.

477
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:07,963
You got no one left.

478
01:31:09,506 --> 01:31:11,804
And if we're talking strength
in numbers...

479
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:15,471
'We're talking a bullet, and I
only need one for your fucking head.

480
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:19,942
You don't get it,
you're already dead.

481
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:22,853
You've been dead since
I got the call from Reza.

482
01:31:26,272 --> 01:31:30,072
Now I've got your attention.
It was the name, right'?

483
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:35,491
Reza and the rest of the suits have
been happy with me since day one.

484
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:43,499
Because I know who to pay
and more importantly, how much.

485
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:44,712
But you?

486
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:47,093
All you are is a collector.

487
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:49,346
It was never about replacing me.

488
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:54,635
They sent you here to die.

489
01:31:55,844 --> 01:31:57,016
Fuck you!

490
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:59,727
No, fuck you, big fucking man!

491
01:31:59,889 --> 01:32:03,894
You listen to me, you think
they'll let you join them at the top?

492
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:07,940
Never! You'll always be looking up.

493
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:12,657
You think when all this is over they'll
welcome you back and promote you.

494
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:14,162
Make you a hero?

495
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,118
Never! You fuck!

496
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:18,704
You'll be met by someone
emptying a gun into you.

497
01:32:18,867 --> 01:32:23,498
A fucking pillow over your face
when you sleep.

498
01:32:23,663 --> 01:32:28,510
You're done, you're out.

499
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:30,717
Asshole.

500
01:32:31,921 --> 01:32:33,764
Be quiet.

501
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:52,295
<i>All residents, please return
to your rooms.</i>

502
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:55,300
<i>It's all over.</i>

503
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:05,311
<i>He always knew that someday
someone would try to fuck him over.</i>

504
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:07,726
<i>This was his insurance.</i>

505
01:34:07,892 --> 01:34:11,362
<i>It's evidence of every
dirty cop he ever dealt with.</i>

506
01:34:12,188 --> 01:34:15,032
<i>Not everyone you salute is rotten.</i>

507
01:34:15,191 --> 01:34:16,909
<i>Find Bunawar.</i>

508
01:34:17,068 --> 01:34:18,786
<i>He's a good man.</i>

509
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:53,651
Open the gate!

510
01:34:57,942 --> 01:34:59,660
Just keep walking.

511
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:01,412
Follow me.

512
01:35:03,323 --> 01:35:06,497
If there's one thing I know for sure,
it's that in this world...

513
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:09,546
...I can protect you.

514
01:35:10,747 --> 01:35:13,375
But can you do the same
for me in yours?

515
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:16,844
They'll come here.

516
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:20,882
They'll tear this place to the ground.

517
01:35:21,466 --> 01:35:24,686
We'll be long gone
before they get here.

518
01:35:26,763 --> 01:35:28,310
Then why stay?

519
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:31,477
For the same reason
you stayed in that uniform.

520
01:35:33,853 --> 01:35:35,776
It just fits.
