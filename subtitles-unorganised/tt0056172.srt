1
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:42,008
He was the most extraordinary man
I ever knew.

2
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:44,200
Did you know him well?

3
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:46,002
I knew him.

4
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:49,923
Well, nil nisi bonum.

5
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:52,006
But did he really deserve...

6
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:54,404
...a place in here?

7
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:11,522
Lord Allenby, could you give
a few words about Lawrence?

8
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:13,646
What, more words?

9
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,200
The revolt in the desert...

10
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:20,924
...played a decisive part
in the Middle Eastern campaign.

11
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:23,808
Yes, sir, but about
Colonel Lawrence himself.

12
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:28,198
No, no. I didn't know him well,
you know.

13
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:34,206
Mr. Bentley, you know as much
about Lawrence as anybody.

14
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:37,048
Yes, it was my privilege to know him.

15
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,803
And to make him known to the world.

16
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:44,241
He was a poet, a scholar
and a mighty warrior.

17
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:45,478
Thank you.

18
00:08:45,689 --> 00:08:50,205
He was also the most shameless
exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.

19
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:52,241
You, sir. Who are you?

20
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:54,605
My name is Jackson Bentley.

21
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:58,843
I overheard your last remark
and take the gravest exception.

22
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:01,239
-He was a great man.
-Did you know him?

23
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:03,400
No, I can't claim to have known him.

24
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,998
I had the honour to shake his hand
in Damascus.

25
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:07,807
Knew him? I never knew him.

26
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:11,325
He had some minor function
on my staff in Cairo.

27
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:31,802
Michael George Hartley...

28
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:35,200
...this is a nasty, dark little room.

29
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,438
That's right.

30
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:38,805
We are not happy in it.

31
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:42,718
I am. It's better than
a nasty, dark little trench.

32
00:09:42,969 --> 00:09:46,200
-Then you're a big noble fellow.
-That's right.

33
00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:51,204
Here is William Potter
with my newspaper.

34
00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:53,799
-Here you are, Tosh.
-Thanks.

35
00:09:55,849 --> 00:09:58,807
Would you care for one of
Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?

36
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:02,439
-Is it there?
-Of course.

37
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:04,202
Headlines.

38
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:07,806
But I bet it isn't mentioned
in the Times.

39
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:12,607
" Bedouin tribes attack
Turkish stronghold."

40
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:17,038
I bet that no one in this
headquarters even knows it happened.

41
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:20,804
Or would care if it did.
Allow me to ignite your cigarette.

42
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:25,205
-Mr. Lawrence?
-Yes.

43
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:27,604
-Flimsy, sir.
-Thank you.

44
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:37,520
You'll do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood.

45
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:40,408
Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.

46
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:42,406
And you're balmy!

47
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:58,802
-It damn well hurts!
-Certainly, it hurts.

48
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:00,802
What's the trick, then?

49
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:04,922
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

50
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:08,002
By the way, if Captain Gibbon
should enquire for me...

51
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:11,400
...tell him I've gone
for a chat with the general.

52
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,205
-He's balmy.
-He's all right.

53
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,322
Lawrence.

54
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:24,238
Yes?

55
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:26,207
You're supposed to be....

56
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:28,878
Do you usually wear your cap
in the mess?

57
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:30,718
Always.

58
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:33,045
You should be on duty.
Where are you going?

59
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:35,598
Mustn't talk shop,
Freddie, not in the mess.

60
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:37,640
I'm going for a powwow
with the general.

61
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:41,245
I'm not asking as your superior,
but as the secretary of this mess.

62
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:43,798
We don't want chaps in here
who should be on duty.

63
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:45,442
Where are you going?

64
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,001
I must say, Lawrence!

65
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,928
-Sorry.
-You're a clown, Lawrence.

66
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:56,400
Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.

67
00:11:58,929 --> 00:11:59,918
Sorry.

68
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:02,600
It's an intrigue, Dryden.

69
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:05,926
I do not propose to let
an overweening, crass lieutenant...

70
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:09,525
...thumb his nose at his commander
and get away with it.

71
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:12,886
It doesn't sound as though
he'd be any great loss.

72
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:16,361
Don't try that, Dryden.
There's a principle involved.

73
00:12:16,609 --> 00:12:18,042
There is, indeed.

74
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:20,120
He's of no use here in Cairo.

75
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:23,327
He might be in Arabia.
He knows his stuff, sir.

76
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:25,002
Knows the books, you mean.

77
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:28,201
I've already sent out
Colonel Brighton, who's a soldier.

78
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:31,082
If Brighton thinks we should send
some arms, we will.

79
00:12:33,249 --> 00:12:34,807
Well, what more do you want?

80
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:38,001
That there would be no question
of Lieutenant Lawrence...

81
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:40,040
...giving military advice.

82
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:42,120
By God, I should hope not.

83
00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:46,920
It's just that the Arab Bureau would
like its own man on the spot to....

84
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:47,925
To what?

85
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:50,524
To make our own appraisal
of the situation.

86
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:54,643
I'll tell you, it's my considered
opinion and that of my staff...

87
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:57,562
...that time spent on the Bedouin
will be time wasted.

88
00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:00,039
They're a nation of sheep-stealers.

89
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:03,042
They did attack Medina.

90
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:05,519
And the Turks made mincemeat of them.

91
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:07,043
We don't know that.

92
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:11,561
We know that they didn't take it.
A storm in a teacup, a sideshow.

93
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:16,043
In my opinion, this whole theatre
of operations is a sideshow.

94
00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:19,526
The real war's being fought against
Germans, not Turks.

95
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:22,442
Not here, but on
the Western front in the trenches.

96
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:24,998
Your Bedouin Army,
or whatever it calls itself...

97
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:27,723
...would be a sideshow of a sideshow.

98
00:13:27,969 --> 00:13:30,483
Big things have small beginnings, sir.

99
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:34,721
Does the Arab Bureau
want a big thing in Arabia?

100
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:39,247
Does the bureau think they'll sit down
under us when this war is over?

101
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:44,199
The bureau thinks the job of
the moment, sir, is to win the war.

102
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:47,004
Don't tell me my duty, Mr. Dryden.

103
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:49,805
-Lawrence, sir.
-Send him in.

104
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:52,804
Good morning, sir.

105
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:54,402
Salute.

106
00:13:56,489 --> 00:13:59,720
If you're insubordinate,
I shall put you under arrest.

107
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:01,641
-It's my manner.
-Your what?

108
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:04,642
My manner. It looks insubordinate,
but it isn't.

109
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:08,678
I can't make out whether you're
bad-mannered or just half-witted.

110
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:11,807
-I have the same problem, sir.
-Shut up.

111
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:15,280
The Arab Bureau thinks you
would be of use to them in Arabia.

112
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:17,122
Why, I can't imagine.

113
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:19,678
You can't perform
your present duties properly.

114
00:14:20,489 --> 00:14:24,607
" I cannot fiddle, but I can make
a great state from a little city."

115
00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:26,925
-What?
-Themistocles, sir.

116
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:30,605
-A Greek philosopher.
-I know you've been well-educated.

117
00:14:30,849 --> 00:14:32,999
It says so in your dossier.

118
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:38,167
You're the kind of creature
I can't stand, Lawrence.

119
00:14:40,289 --> 00:14:42,405
But I suppose I could be wrong.

120
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:45,648
All right, Dryden.
You can have him for six weeks.

121
00:14:45,849 --> 00:14:49,205
Who knows? It might even
make a man of him. Come in!

122
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:52,408
Yes, what is it?

123
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:55,243
The convoy will be in
Port Said tomorrow night.

124
00:14:55,489 --> 00:14:57,400
-Is that certain?
-Yes, sir.

125
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:00,519
There doesn't seem to be
any artillery.

126
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:03,408
But there must be artillery!

127
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:09,445
Sir, this is something
of an expedition.

128
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:13,682
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,
find the Arabs and then get back.

129
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:16,397
He can't do that in six weeks.

130
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,609
-Two months, then.
-Three.

131
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:24,008
All right, three. Now, will you
let me do some work, Mr. Dryden?

132
00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:25,807
Thank you, sir.

133
00:15:28,249 --> 00:15:31,400
I'd like to say, sir,
that I am gratef ul for this.

134
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:33,446
Shut up and get out.

135
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:40,608
Sir?

136
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:49,126
How can I fight a bloody war
without bloody artillery?

137
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:53,843
-How did you do it?
-Might better ask why I bothered to.

138
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:57,445
-Because I'm the man for the job.
-I just wonder about that.

139
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:00,442
Of course I am.
What is the job, by the way?

140
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:02,327
Find Prince Feisal.

141
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:04,321
Good. And when I've found him?

142
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:08,404
Find out what kind of a man he is.

143
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:12,198
Find out what his intentions are.
Not his immediate intentions.

144
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:14,843
That is Colonel Brighton's business,
not yours.

145
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:19,207
I mean, his intentions
in Arabia altogether.

146
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:23,802
That's new.

147
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:26,608
Where are they now?

148
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:29,607
Anywhere within 300 miles of Medina.

149
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:31,242
They're Hashemite Bedouins.

150
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:35,004
They can cross 60 miles of desert
in a day.

151
00:16:35,249 --> 00:16:37,126
Thanks. This is going to be fun.

152
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:41,404
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature
get fun in the desert:

153
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:45,005
Bedouins and gods, and you're neither.
Take it from me.

154
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:48,400
For ordinary men,
it's a burning fiery furnace.

155
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:52,198
No, Dryden. It's going to be fun.

156
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:59,046
It is recognized that you have
a funny sense of fun.

157
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:13,607
Here you may drink.

158
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:18,397
One cup.

159
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:27,402
You do not drink?

160
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:28,998
No.

161
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,001
I'll drink when you do.

162
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:33,924
I am Bedu.

163
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:33,448
Truly, now, you are a British officer?

164
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:35,008
Yes.

165
00:20:35,689 --> 00:20:37,202
From Cairo?

166
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:39,008
Yes.

167
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:42,601
-You did not ride from Cairo?
-No.

168
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:46,598
Thank heaven. It's 900 miles.
I came by boat.

169
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:48,602
And before?

170
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:51,603
From Britain?

171
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:53,208
Yes.

172
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:55,808
Truly?

173
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:57,642
From Oxfordshire.

174
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:01,008
Is that a desert country?

175
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:06,121
No. A fat country. Fat people.

176
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:08,804
You are not fat?

177
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:10,604
No.

178
00:21:12,089 --> 00:21:13,602
I'm different.

179
00:21:40,489 --> 00:21:41,808
Here...

180
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,002
...take it.

181
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:48,119
First I take you to Lord Feisal,
then you give it to me.

182
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:49,802
Take it now.

183
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:09,207
Bedu food.

184
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:25,208
Good.

185
00:22:25,449 --> 00:22:26,598
More?

186
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:15,605
-Bedu.
-Where?

187
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:38,203
From here to Lord Feisal's camp
is Harith country.

188
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:39,598
Yes, I know.

189
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:41,640
-I am not Harith.
-No.

190
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:44,403
Hazimi, of the Beni Salem.

191
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:22,440
Put the right foot in tight.
Lock it with your left foot.

192
00:24:22,689 --> 00:24:24,202
When you are ready to go...

193
00:24:24,449 --> 00:24:27,407
...hit her on the shoulder
and say, " Hut-hut-hut."

194
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:47,844
Today will be difficult,
but tomorrow, good riding.

195
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:07,559
I think we reach Masturah Well
tomorrow. Yes.

196
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:11,239
And from Masturah Well to
Lord Feisal's camp, one day more.

197
00:25:11,489 --> 00:25:12,604
Now!

198
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:11,397
Good?

199
00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:13,401
It's all right.

200
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,605
This is a Harith well.

201
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,398
The Harith are a dirty people.

202
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,008
Turks?

203
00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:05,478
Bedu.

204
00:28:50,089 --> 00:28:51,807
Who is he?

205
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:44,802
He is dead.

206
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:46,602
Yes.

207
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:48,884
Why?

208
00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:53,002
This my well.

209
00:29:54,569 --> 00:29:56,127
I have drunk from it.

210
00:29:57,049 --> 00:29:58,721
You are welcome.

211
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:01,637
He was my friend.

212
00:30:01,889 --> 00:30:04,608
-That?
-Yes, that.

213
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:17,406
-This pistol yours?
-No, his.

214
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:34,603
His?

215
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,403
Mine.

216
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:38,801
Then I will use it.

217
00:30:46,369 --> 00:30:48,519
Your friend...

218
00:30:50,489 --> 00:30:52,605
...was a Hazimi of the Beni Salem.

219
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:54,202
I know.

220
00:31:01,449 --> 00:31:02,677
I am Ali ibn el Kharish.

221
00:31:04,849 --> 00:31:06,168
I have heard of you.

222
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:09,401
So...

223
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:13,446
...what was a Hazimi doing here?

224
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:16,999
He was taking me to help
Prince Feisal.

225
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:20,799
-You've been sent from Cairo.
-Yes.

226
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:24,599
I have been in Cairo for my schooling.

227
00:31:25,489 --> 00:31:27,798
I can both read and write.

228
00:31:31,409 --> 00:31:35,197
My Lord Feisal already
has an Englishman.

229
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:37,207
What is your name?

230
00:31:38,089 --> 00:31:40,603
My name is for my friends.

231
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:47,845
None of my friends is a murderer.

232
00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:51,640
You are angry, English.

233
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:01,807
He was nothing.

234
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:03,807
The well is everything.

235
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:07,607
The Hazimi may not drink
at our wells.

236
00:32:07,849 --> 00:32:09,407
He knew that.

237
00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:12,798
Salaam.

238
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:15,881
Sherif Ali.

239
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:19,207
So long as the Arabs fight
tribe against tribe...

240
00:32:19,449 --> 00:32:21,838
...so long will they be
a little people...

241
00:32:22,089 --> 00:32:23,408
...a silly people.

242
00:32:23,889 --> 00:32:27,928
Greedy, barbarous and cruel,
as you are.

243
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:42,478
Come.

244
00:32:43,489 --> 00:32:45,002
I will take you to Feisal.

245
00:32:45,209 --> 00:32:47,200
I do not want your company, sherif.

246
00:32:47,449 --> 00:32:50,600
Wadi Saf ra is another day from here.

247
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,847
You will not find it,
and you will die.

248
00:32:54,569 --> 00:32:57,800
I will find it with this.

249
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:08,000
Good army compass.

250
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,400
How if I take it?

251
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:12,043
Then you would be a thief.

252
00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:14,488
Have you no fear, English?

253
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,803
My fear is my concern.

254
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:19,608
Truly.

255
00:33:23,449 --> 00:33:25,405
God be with you, English.

256
00:34:10,209 --> 00:34:14,725
As I walk along the Bois de Boulogne
With an independent air

257
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,760
You can hear the girls declare

258
00:34:17,009 --> 00:34:19,728
He must be a millionaire

259
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:43,166
I'm the man who broke the bank
At Monte Carlo

260
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:02,327
Hey, you!

261
00:35:19,969 --> 00:35:22,961
-I've been waiting for you.
-Did you know I was coming?

262
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:25,359
I knew someone was coming.
Feisal told me.

263
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:26,928
How did he know?

264
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:29,922
Not much happens within 50 miles
of Feisal that he doesn't know.

265
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,125
I'll give him that. No escort?

266
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:34,718
My guide was killed
at the Masturah Well.

267
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:37,727
-Turks?
-No, an Arab.

268
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,324
Bloody savages.

269
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:44,967
-This is Wadi Saf ra, isn't it?
-Yes, they're over there.

270
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,643
Just a minute.
What's your name and who sent you?

271
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:51,723
Lawrence. I've been seconded
to the Arab Bureau.

272
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:56,519
What are you to do
for the Arab Bureau?

273
00:35:56,729 --> 00:36:01,519
Well, it's rather vague, sir.
I'm to appreciate the situation.

274
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:05,918
Well, that won't be difficult.
The situation's bloody awf ul.

275
00:36:06,169 --> 00:36:09,161
Their morale, if they ever had any,
which I doubt...

276
00:36:09,409 --> 00:36:13,243
...the Turks knocked out of them
in front of Medina, with howitzers.

277
00:36:13,489 --> 00:36:15,764
They're fading away by dozens
every night.

278
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:17,567
What I want to say is this:

279
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:20,323
Wherever you are
and whoever you are with...

280
00:36:20,529 --> 00:36:22,326
...you're a British officer.
Here's an order.

281
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:26,124
When we get into that camp,
you're to keep your mouth shut.

282
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:30,117
-Do you understand what I'm saying?
-I understand what you're saying.

283
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:33,127
You'll make your appreciation
and get back to--

284
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,321
Oh, my God.

285
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:39,727
Not again.

286
00:37:07,409 --> 00:37:10,446
I've told him!
God knows I've told him.

287
00:37:10,689 --> 00:37:13,726
" Move South, " I've said.
"You're still in range."

288
00:37:15,569 --> 00:37:18,925
They simply will not understand
what modern weapons do!

289
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:47,645
Stand and fight. Stand and fight.

290
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:53,922
Fire back at them.

291
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:06,001
-Who are you?
-Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.

292
00:39:06,249 --> 00:39:07,841
Seconded to the Arab Bureau.

293
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:11,206
This is a bloody mess, sir.
We'll have to move south.

294
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,724
Yes, colonel, 50 miles south.

295
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:16,722
You were right and I was wrong.

296
00:39:16,969 --> 00:39:18,960
We must take some thought
for the wounded.

297
00:39:19,209 --> 00:39:22,326
-We can take care of them at Yenbo.
-lf they can get to Yenbo.

298
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:24,008
They can hardly come with us.

299
00:39:24,249 --> 00:39:28,367
No. They must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant...?

300
00:39:29,209 --> 00:39:30,358
Lawrence.

301
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:32,918
You understand, Lieutenant Lawrence...

302
00:39:33,129 --> 00:39:37,998
...my people are unused to
explosives and machines.

303
00:39:38,529 --> 00:39:42,317
First the guns, and now this.

304
00:40:34,689 --> 00:40:35,917
Cigarette?

305
00:40:36,129 --> 00:40:37,528
I'm sorry.

306
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:49,640
Cigarette, Your Excellency?

307
00:40:50,529 --> 00:40:51,803
Umph off.

308
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:55,328
Please, Your Excellency.
Just one for two?

309
00:41:12,289 --> 00:41:13,404
Hold it, Jenkins!

310
00:41:17,569 --> 00:41:18,922
Jenkins!

311
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:29,527
Lawrence?

312
00:41:31,809 --> 00:41:33,128
You have no servant.

313
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:35,758
-I don't need a servant.
-No?

314
00:41:36,009 --> 00:41:39,558
We can do everything. Light fires,
cook food, wash clothes.

315
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:41,720
-Yes, everything.
-I don't doubt it.

316
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:44,927
-It will be very nice for you.
-I can't afford it.

317
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:11,321
Recite, then, as much of the Koran
as may be easy to you.

318
00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:15,084
God knoweth that there be
some among you sick...

319
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:21,123
...while others travel through the
Earth in quest for the bounties of God.

320
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:26,448
Others do battle in His cause.

321
00:42:26,689 --> 00:42:30,841
Recite, therefore,
as much as may be easy.

322
00:42:31,409 --> 00:42:34,128
And observe the prayers.

323
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:40,488
This will be best and richest
in the recompense.

324
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:45,318
Seek ye the forgiveness of God.

325
00:42:46,089 --> 00:42:50,924
Verily, God is forgiving, mercif ul--

326
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:52,522
Greetings, Ali.

327
00:42:52,729 --> 00:42:54,447
-My lord.
-Sherif Ali.

328
00:42:54,689 --> 00:42:58,728
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met
Sherif Ali, I think.

329
00:42:59,569 --> 00:43:01,321
Yes, my lord.

330
00:43:03,729 --> 00:43:05,924
And now, Selim, "The Brightness."

331
00:43:06,129 --> 00:43:08,359
" By the noonday brightness...

332
00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:10,645
...and by the night
when it darkeneth...

333
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:13,198
...thy Lord hath not forsaken thee...

334
00:43:13,449 --> 00:43:15,758
...neither hath He been displeased.

335
00:43:16,009 --> 00:43:20,127
And surely the future shall be better
for thee than the past."

336
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:23,725
"And in the end shall your Lord be
bounteous to thee...

337
00:43:23,929 --> 00:43:26,124
...and thou be satisfied."

338
00:43:28,009 --> 00:43:29,328
So?

339
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:32,358
Yes, colonel.

340
00:43:32,769 --> 00:43:36,318
-I want a decision, sir.
-You want me to fall back on Yenbo.

341
00:43:36,569 --> 00:43:39,129
Well, you're not doing
much good here, sir.

342
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:43,083
I'm sorry to rub it in, sir,
but we can't supply you here.

343
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,206
You could supply us through Aqaba!

344
00:43:45,609 --> 00:43:47,122
Aqaba!

345
00:43:47,889 --> 00:43:50,449
If you can get ahold of Aqaba,
we can supply you.

346
00:43:50,649 --> 00:43:52,560
-But you can't!
-You could.

347
00:43:53,009 --> 00:43:55,523
You mean, the navy?

348
00:43:56,369 --> 00:43:59,566
The Turks have 12-inch guns
at Aqaba, sir.

349
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:01,720
Can you imagine what that means?

350
00:44:01,969 --> 00:44:03,607
Yes, I can imagine.

351
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:07,848
Put that out of your mind, sir.
The navy's got other things to do.

352
00:44:08,049 --> 00:44:10,483
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.

353
00:44:11,209 --> 00:44:14,724
The one essential sector of this front
is and must be the canal.

354
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:16,681
You can see that, sir, surely.

355
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:19,722
I see that the canal is
an essential British interest.

356
00:44:19,929 --> 00:44:21,885
It is of little consequence to us.

357
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:24,325
I must ask you not to speak like that.

358
00:44:24,569 --> 00:44:27,083
British and Arab interests are
one and the same.

359
00:44:28,409 --> 00:44:30,001
Possibly.

360
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:33,764
Upon my word, sir, you're ungratef ul.

361
00:44:34,009 --> 00:44:36,523
Fall back on Yenbo and we will
give you equipment.

362
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:38,845
Give you arms, advice,
training, everything.

363
00:44:39,089 --> 00:44:41,842
-Guns?
-A modern rifle for every man.

364
00:44:42,089 --> 00:44:44,842
No. Guns. Artillery.

365
00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:48,206
Guns like the Turkish guns at Medina.

366
00:44:48,409 --> 00:44:51,367
Yes, give us guns
and keep the training.

367
00:44:51,609 --> 00:44:55,124
Your men need training
far more than guns, sir.

368
00:44:55,369 --> 00:44:56,961
English will teach
Bedu to fight?

369
00:44:57,209 --> 00:45:01,122
We will teach them, Sherif Ali,
to fight a modern mechanized army.

370
00:45:02,729 --> 00:45:06,688
Yes, lieutenant?
What do you think about Yenbo?

371
00:45:10,369 --> 00:45:13,088
I think it is far from Damascus.

372
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:16,560
We'll have you in Damascus, sir.
Never fear.

373
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:19,642
Have you been in Damascus,
Mr. Lawrence?

374
00:45:20,209 --> 00:45:21,562
Yes, my lord.

375
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:24,127
It is beautif ul, is it not?

376
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:26,007
-Very.
-That will do, Lawrence.

377
00:45:26,249 --> 00:45:30,162
Dreaming won't get you to Damascus,
but discipline will.

378
00:45:30,409 --> 00:45:35,244
Look, Great Britain is a small
country, much smaller than yours.

379
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:37,684
Small population compared with some.

380
00:45:37,889 --> 00:45:40,926
It's small, but it's great. And why?

381
00:45:41,169 --> 00:45:43,888
-Because it has guns.
-Because it has discipline.

382
00:45:44,129 --> 00:45:48,122
Because it has a navy, because of this,
the English go where they please...

383
00:45:48,369 --> 00:45:50,837
...and strike where they please.
This makes them great.

384
00:45:51,129 --> 00:45:53,120
-Right.
-Mr. Lawrence, that will do!

385
00:45:53,369 --> 00:45:55,519
Lawrence is not your military adviser.

386
00:45:55,769 --> 00:45:57,760
But I would like to hear his opinion.

387
00:45:58,209 --> 00:46:00,325
Damn it!
Who do you take your orders from?

388
00:46:00,569 --> 00:46:03,845
From Lord Feisal, in Feisal's tent.

389
00:46:04,089 --> 00:46:09,117
Old fool! Why turn from him to him?
They are master and man.

390
00:46:10,209 --> 00:46:13,724
My lord, I think....

391
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:16,725
I think your book is right.

392
00:46:17,009 --> 00:46:21,241
The desert is an ocean
in which no oar is dipped.

393
00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:25,038
On this ocean, the Bedu go where they
please and strike where they please.

394
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:27,439
This is the way the Bedu has
always fought.

395
00:46:27,689 --> 00:46:30,487
You're famed through the world
for fighting this way.

396
00:46:30,729 --> 00:46:32,765
And this is the way you should
fight now.

397
00:46:33,009 --> 00:46:34,522
I don't know.

398
00:46:34,769 --> 00:46:36,919
I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong.

399
00:46:37,529 --> 00:46:41,647
Fall back on Yenbo, the Arab Rising
becomes one unit in the British army.

400
00:46:41,889 --> 00:46:43,959
-What is this to you?
-You're a traitor.

401
00:46:44,209 --> 00:46:46,165
No, colonel.

402
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:49,526
He is a young man,
and young men are passionate.

403
00:46:49,769 --> 00:46:52,727
They must say their say.

404
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:58,599
But wiser people must decide.
I know you are right.

405
00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:01,243
Very well. When shall we move?
The sooner the better.

406
00:47:01,489 --> 00:47:03,923
You'll lose another 50 men tonight.

407
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:07,720
You tread heavily...

408
00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:11,329
...but you speak the truth.

409
00:47:12,889 --> 00:47:16,245
I will give you my answer tomorrow.
And now...

410
00:47:16,609 --> 00:47:18,327
...it is late.

411
00:47:33,409 --> 00:47:38,722
Colonel Brighton means to put my men
under European officers, does he not?

412
00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:40,766
In effect, my lord, yes.

413
00:47:41,009 --> 00:47:42,920
And I must do it...

414
00:47:43,529 --> 00:47:47,124
...because the Turks have
European guns.

415
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:49,929
But I fear to do it...

416
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:52,919
...upon my soul I do.

417
00:47:54,809 --> 00:47:58,768
The English have a great hunger for
desolate places.

418
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:02,046
I fear they hunger for Arabia.

419
00:48:02,289 --> 00:48:04,120
Then you must deny it to them.

420
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:07,805
You are an Englishman.
Are you not Ioyal to England?

421
00:48:08,409 --> 00:48:11,207
To England and to other things.

422
00:48:11,489 --> 00:48:13,957
To England and Arabia both?

423
00:48:14,209 --> 00:48:15,927
And is that possible?

424
00:48:22,409 --> 00:48:26,448
I think you are another of these
desert-Ioving English.

425
00:48:26,689 --> 00:48:28,725
Doughty, Stanhope...

426
00:48:29,289 --> 00:48:31,519
...Gordon of Khartoum.

427
00:48:31,729 --> 00:48:33,924
No Arab loves the desert.

428
00:48:34,169 --> 00:48:38,924
We love water and green trees.
There is nothing in the desert.

429
00:48:39,969 --> 00:48:42,324
And no man needs nothing.

430
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:48,759
Or is it that you think we are
something you can play with...

431
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:52,445
...because we are a little people,
a silly people...

432
00:48:52,689 --> 00:48:56,728
...greedy, barbarous and cruel?

433
00:48:57,009 --> 00:49:00,160
Or do you know, lieutenant,
in the Arab city of Cordoba...

434
00:49:00,409 --> 00:49:02,764
...were two miles of lighting
in the streets...

435
00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:04,647
...when London was a village.

436
00:49:04,889 --> 00:49:07,562
Yes, you were great.

437
00:49:07,809 --> 00:49:09,845
Nine centuries ago.

438
00:49:10,089 --> 00:49:12,159
Time to be great again, my lord.

439
00:49:12,409 --> 00:49:15,526
Which is why my father made this war
upon the Turks.

440
00:49:15,769 --> 00:49:19,364
My father, Mr. Lawrence,
not the English.

441
00:49:20,569 --> 00:49:22,719
But my father is old...

442
00:49:23,689 --> 00:49:25,327
...and I...

443
00:49:26,929 --> 00:49:30,524
...I long for the vanished
gardens of Cordoba.

444
00:49:32,289 --> 00:49:35,122
However, before the gardens
must come the fighting.

445
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:40,118
To be great again, it seems that we
need the English...

446
00:49:40,369 --> 00:49:41,358
...or....

447
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:42,928
Or?

448
00:49:43,409 --> 00:49:46,924
What no man can provide, Mr. Lawrence.

449
00:49:47,169 --> 00:49:49,524
We need a miracle.

450
00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:48,198
Aqaba.

451
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:52,922
Aqaba.

452
00:52:53,729 --> 00:52:55,287
From the land.

453
00:52:56,209 --> 00:52:57,927
You are mad.

454
00:52:58,289 --> 00:53:02,521
To come to Aqaba by land we should
have to cross the Nef ud Desert.

455
00:53:02,729 --> 00:53:03,923
That's right.

456
00:53:04,209 --> 00:53:06,325
The Nef ud cannot be crossed.

457
00:53:06,529 --> 00:53:08,326
I'll cross it if you will.

458
00:53:08,529 --> 00:53:12,522
You? It takes more than a compass,
Englishman.

459
00:53:12,769 --> 00:53:15,442
The Nef ud is the worst place
God created.

460
00:53:15,689 --> 00:53:19,523
I can't answer for the place.
Only for myself.

461
00:53:19,929 --> 00:53:21,362
Fifty men?

462
00:53:21,609 --> 00:53:24,043
Fifty? Against Aqaba?

463
00:53:24,289 --> 00:53:26,564
If 50 men came out of the Nef ud...

464
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:29,721
...they would be 50 men
other men might join.

465
00:53:30,489 --> 00:53:32,719
The Howeitat are there, I hear.

466
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,921
The Howeitat are brigands.
They'll sell themselves to anyone.

467
00:53:36,169 --> 00:53:38,319
-Good fighters, though.
-Good--

468
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:42,520
Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.

469
00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:46,728
They face the sea, Sherif Ali,
and cannot be turned around.

470
00:53:46,929 --> 00:53:50,524
From the landward side,
there are no guns at Aqaba.

471
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:55,559
With good reason. It cannot be
approached from the landward side.

472
00:53:55,809 --> 00:53:58,323
Certainly the Turks don't dream of it.

473
00:54:01,609 --> 00:54:03,520
Aqaba's over there.

474
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,125
It's only a matter of going.

475
00:54:09,209 --> 00:54:11,439
You are mad.

476
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:20,723
And where are you going, lieutenant?

477
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,965
With 50 of my men.

478
00:54:25,489 --> 00:54:26,683
To work your miracle.

479
00:54:27,009 --> 00:54:31,127
Blasphemy is a bad beginning
for such a journey.

480
00:54:31,809 --> 00:54:34,277
-Who told you?
-Ali did.

481
00:54:34,489 --> 00:54:36,127
Why not you?

482
00:54:37,689 --> 00:54:40,567
You are falling back from Yenbo, sir?

483
00:54:40,809 --> 00:54:42,959
Yes, I must.

484
00:54:43,209 --> 00:54:46,121
But I will spare these to you.

485
00:54:47,969 --> 00:54:50,927
Did Ali break confidence to tell me?

486
00:54:51,529 --> 00:54:55,317
Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance,
my lord.

487
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,598
Yet you did not tell
Colonel Brighton.

488
00:54:58,849 --> 00:54:59,838
No.

489
00:55:11,209 --> 00:55:13,120
Since you do know...

490
00:55:13,609 --> 00:55:16,999
...we can claim to arrive
in the name of Feisal of Mecca.

491
00:55:17,409 --> 00:55:20,526
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence,
you may claim it.

492
00:55:21,369 --> 00:55:24,327
But in whose name do you ride?

493
00:57:46,769 --> 00:57:49,363
Sherif, I caught them.
They have tracked us.

494
00:57:49,609 --> 00:57:51,725
They were here. I caught them.

495
00:57:51,929 --> 00:57:54,727
Why are you here? Boy!

496
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:56,760
To serve Lord Lawrence, sherif.

497
00:57:57,009 --> 00:57:59,523
This is true, Lawrence.
They do wish it.

498
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:01,521
You have been tracking us.

499
00:58:02,169 --> 00:58:04,319
-You were told to stay.
-No, sherif.

500
00:58:04,569 --> 00:58:06,525
Our camel strayed. We followed her.

501
00:58:06,769 --> 00:58:09,567
She led us here to be
Lord Lawrence's servants.

502
00:58:09,809 --> 00:58:12,323
-It is the will of Allah.
-Blasphemy.

503
00:58:12,529 --> 00:58:13,757
Don't do that.

504
00:58:14,209 --> 00:58:18,725
No, Lawrence, these are not servants.
These are outcasts, parent-less.

505
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,923
Be warned. They are not suitable.

506
00:58:22,129 --> 00:58:25,758
They sound very suitable.
You can ride with the baggage.

507
00:58:27,329 --> 00:58:30,605
These are not servants.
These are worshippers.

508
00:58:34,489 --> 00:58:37,162
One shilling, every week?

509
00:58:37,409 --> 00:58:38,922
That is fair.

510
00:58:39,609 --> 00:58:40,837
-Each?
-No.

511
00:58:41,089 --> 00:58:42,602
-That is too much.
-All right.

512
00:58:50,889 --> 00:58:54,882
They will be lucky for you.
Allah favours the compassionate.

513
00:59:08,209 --> 00:59:09,927
There is the railway.

514
00:59:10,729 --> 00:59:13,562
And that is the desert.

515
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:18,518
From here until the other side,
no water but what we carry.

516
00:59:18,729 --> 00:59:21,880
For the camels, no water at all.

517
00:59:22,489 --> 00:59:24,525
If the camels die...

518
00:59:25,809 --> 00:59:27,128
...we die.

519
00:59:28,009 --> 00:59:30,728
And in 20 days they will start to die.

520
00:59:36,009 --> 00:59:39,126
There's no time to waste, then,
is there?

521
01:02:04,969 --> 01:02:06,607
I was thinking.

522
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:08,487
You were drifting.

523
01:02:10,369 --> 01:02:13,884
Yes. It will not happen again.

524
01:02:14,169 --> 01:02:17,684
Be warned, you were drifting.

525
01:02:18,329 --> 01:02:20,285
It will not happen again.

526
01:03:19,849 --> 01:03:21,680
That water is wasted.

527
01:03:26,889 --> 01:03:29,084
From now on,
we must travel by night...

528
01:03:29,329 --> 01:03:32,127
...and rest while it is
too hot to travel.

529
01:03:32,369 --> 01:03:34,678
A few hours each day.

530
01:03:36,449 --> 01:03:38,280
Why don't we start now?

531
01:03:38,489 --> 01:03:41,083
No. We will rest now.

532
01:03:42,849 --> 01:03:43,918
Three hours.

533
01:03:44,169 --> 01:03:45,488
Fine.

534
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:47,488
I'll wake you.

535
01:06:00,329 --> 01:06:01,808
Do we rest here?

536
01:06:02,049 --> 01:06:05,086
There is no rest now short of water.

537
01:06:05,369 --> 01:06:07,280
The other side of that.

538
01:06:08,369 --> 01:06:10,485
And how much of that is there?

539
01:06:10,769 --> 01:06:12,282
I'm not sure.

540
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:17,487
But however much, it must be crossed
before tomorrow's sun gets up.

541
01:06:18,569 --> 01:06:20,685
This is the sun's anvil.

542
01:07:49,529 --> 01:07:50,723
Have we done it?

543
01:07:50,929 --> 01:07:53,921
No, but we're off the anvil.

544
01:07:54,769 --> 01:07:56,282
Thank God for that anyway.

545
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,286
Yes, thank Him.

546
01:07:58,569 --> 01:08:02,005
Lawrence, I do not think you know
how you have tempted Him.

547
01:08:02,249 --> 01:08:03,477
I know.

548
01:08:06,689 --> 01:08:08,122
We've done it.

549
01:08:08,369 --> 01:08:09,882
God willing.

550
01:08:11,929 --> 01:08:13,885
When do we reach the wells?

551
01:08:14,249 --> 01:08:17,286
God willing, midday.

552
01:08:17,769 --> 01:08:21,000
-Then we've done it.
-Thank Him, Lawrence. Thank Him.

553
01:08:24,569 --> 01:08:26,082
Gasim's.

554
01:08:29,849 --> 01:08:31,487
What's happened to him?

555
01:08:32,249 --> 01:08:33,682
God knows.

556
01:08:35,249 --> 01:08:37,080
Why don't you stop?

557
01:08:37,529 --> 01:08:40,885
For what? He will be dead by midday.

558
01:08:45,969 --> 01:08:47,687
We must go back.

559
01:08:47,929 --> 01:08:50,682
What for, to die with Gasim?

560
01:08:51,929 --> 01:08:54,079
In one hour comes the sun.

561
01:08:55,529 --> 01:09:00,000
In God's name, understand!
We cannot go back!

562
01:09:00,249 --> 01:09:01,477
I can.

563
01:09:02,289 --> 01:09:03,881
Take the boys.

564
01:09:09,529 --> 01:09:11,884
If you go back, you kill yourself,
is all.

565
01:09:12,089 --> 01:09:14,284
Gasim you have killed already.

566
01:09:14,769 --> 01:09:16,043
Get out of my way.

567
01:09:16,369 --> 01:09:20,078
Gasim's time is come, Lawrence.
It is written.

568
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:21,563
Nothing is written!

569
01:09:24,569 --> 01:09:25,922
Go back, then!

570
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:29,480
What did you bring us here for
with your blasphemous conceit?

571
01:09:30,489 --> 01:09:32,286
English blasphemer!

572
01:09:33,329 --> 01:09:34,887
Aqaba?

573
01:09:35,369 --> 01:09:37,087
Was it Aqaba?

574
01:09:37,889 --> 01:09:40,483
You will not be at Aqaba, English!

575
01:09:42,449 --> 01:09:44,007
Go back, blasphemer...

576
01:09:44,569 --> 01:09:46,446
...but you will not be at Aqaba.

577
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,487
I shall be at Aqaba.

578
01:09:48,729 --> 01:09:50,685
That is written.

579
01:09:51,249 --> 01:09:52,477
In here.

580
01:10:01,969 --> 01:10:03,687
English!

581
01:10:03,889 --> 01:10:05,481
English!

582
01:16:22,489 --> 01:16:25,287
Lawrence! Daud!

583
01:18:28,449 --> 01:18:30,485
Nothing is written.

584
01:19:01,369 --> 01:19:02,882
Al Lawrence.

585
01:19:07,129 --> 01:19:08,482
Farraj.

586
01:19:09,569 --> 01:19:10,684
Wash.

587
01:19:46,369 --> 01:19:48,007
Al Lawrence.

588
01:19:48,449 --> 01:19:52,886
Truly, for some men nothing is written
unless they write it.

589
01:19:57,329 --> 01:20:00,207
Not Al Lawrence. Just Lawrence.

590
01:20:00,449 --> 01:20:03,043
-AI Lawrence is better.
-True.

591
01:20:04,969 --> 01:20:07,483
Your father too, just Mr. Lawrence?

592
01:20:13,569 --> 01:20:16,208
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.

593
01:20:16,449 --> 01:20:19,088
-Is that a lord?
-A kind of lord.

594
01:20:19,449 --> 01:20:22,088
Then when he dies,
you too will be a lord.

595
01:20:22,289 --> 01:20:23,483
No.

596
01:20:25,569 --> 01:20:27,241
You have an elder brother.

597
01:20:28,769 --> 01:20:33,684
But then, I do not understand this.
Your father's name is Chapman.

598
01:20:35,169 --> 01:20:37,000
He didn't marry my mother.

599
01:20:38,489 --> 01:20:40,081
I see.

600
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:41,888
I'm sorry.

601
01:20:43,769 --> 01:20:47,523
It seems to me that you are free to
choose your own name, then.

602
01:20:49,969 --> 01:20:52,403
Yes, I suppose I am.

603
01:20:53,689 --> 01:20:55,327
Al Lawrence is best.

604
01:20:58,169 --> 01:21:02,082
All right, I'll settle for
Al Lawrence.

605
01:21:30,569 --> 01:21:33,481
They are the robes of a sherif
of the Beni Wejh.

606
01:21:45,649 --> 01:21:47,287
Very fine.

607
01:21:49,169 --> 01:21:53,128
-Great honour.
-The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.

608
01:21:53,369 --> 01:21:55,678
-Is it permitted?
-Surely.

609
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:05,484
He for whom nothing is written may
write himself a clan.

610
01:22:13,169 --> 01:22:16,320
They are good for riding. Try.

611
01:24:03,849 --> 01:24:05,441
What are you doing, Englishman?

612
01:24:06,769 --> 01:24:08,282
As you see.

613
01:24:09,529 --> 01:24:10,518
Are you alone?

614
01:24:10,969 --> 01:24:12,482
Almost.

615
01:24:20,769 --> 01:24:23,124
Are you with those dogs
drinking at my well?

616
01:24:23,369 --> 01:24:24,688
Yours?

617
01:24:28,169 --> 01:24:29,887
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

618
01:24:31,569 --> 01:24:34,288
I've heard of another man
of that name.

619
01:24:35,169 --> 01:24:36,807
Other? What other?

620
01:24:37,129 --> 01:24:41,168
The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to
summon help to look after his wells.

621
01:24:44,569 --> 01:24:46,605
He must be a great hero.

622
01:24:46,849 --> 01:24:48,487
He is.

623
01:24:48,689 --> 01:24:51,726
He wouldn't ref use water to men coming
out of Nef ud Desert.

624
01:24:52,089 --> 01:24:54,080
Now, would he not?

625
01:24:56,569 --> 01:24:59,288
No, that must be some other man.

626
01:25:01,649 --> 01:25:03,480
Here is my help.

627
01:25:28,129 --> 01:25:30,689
Son, what fashion is this?

628
01:25:31,969 --> 01:25:35,484
-Harith, Father.
-What manner of Harith?

629
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:37,363
A Beni Wejh sherif.

630
01:25:38,289 --> 01:25:39,722
And is he Harith?

631
01:25:39,969 --> 01:25:42,085
No, Father, English.

632
01:25:45,169 --> 01:25:46,488
Son...

633
01:25:47,289 --> 01:25:49,280
...they are stealing our water.

634
01:25:50,169 --> 01:25:51,887
Tell them we are coming.

635
01:25:52,649 --> 01:25:53,684
Tell them.

636
01:27:00,769 --> 01:27:02,361
-Empty that!
-Do not!

637
01:27:04,529 --> 01:27:06,645
It is Auda of the Howeitat who speaks.

638
01:27:07,369 --> 01:27:09,325
It is Ali of the Harith who answers.

639
01:27:24,849 --> 01:27:26,077
Harith.

640
01:27:26,969 --> 01:27:28,084
Ali.

641
01:27:28,769 --> 01:27:30,885
Does your father still steal?

642
01:27:32,929 --> 01:27:34,078
No.

643
01:27:35,649 --> 01:27:38,482
Does Auda take me for
one of his own bastards?

644
01:27:39,649 --> 01:27:42,686
No. There is no resemblance.

645
01:27:43,529 --> 01:27:45,804
Alas, you resemble your father.

646
01:27:46,249 --> 01:27:49,047
-Auda flatters me.
-You are easily flattered.

647
01:27:49,569 --> 01:27:51,878
I knew your father well.

648
01:27:52,329 --> 01:27:54,081
Did you know your own?

649
01:27:57,289 --> 01:28:01,840
We are 50, you are two.
How if we shot you down?

650
01:28:02,329 --> 01:28:05,287
Why, then you have a blood feud
with the Howeitat.

651
01:28:06,529 --> 01:28:09,441
-Do you desire it?
-Not the generals in Cairo...

652
01:28:09,929 --> 01:28:12,887
...nor the sultan himself desire that.

653
01:28:15,889 --> 01:28:17,004
Call off your men.

654
01:28:22,369 --> 01:28:24,883
This honours the unworthy.

655
01:28:25,169 --> 01:28:27,205
I've only just begun to teach him.

656
01:28:27,449 --> 01:28:31,522
And what are you teaching him today?
Howeitat hospitality?

657
01:28:31,769 --> 01:28:33,680
Be not clever with me, English.

658
01:28:35,329 --> 01:28:38,480
-Who is he?
-A friend of Prince Feisal's.

659
01:28:47,569 --> 01:28:50,606
-So you desire my hospitality?
-Yes.

660
01:28:50,849 --> 01:28:52,282
Is he your tongue?

661
01:28:52,969 --> 01:28:54,687
We do desire it.

662
01:28:57,729 --> 01:29:00,687
Then it is given, if you will take it.

663
01:29:02,169 --> 01:29:03,921
I'm at my summer camp, a poor place.

664
01:29:04,169 --> 01:29:08,685
Well, to me it seems a poor place.
Some men find it marvellous.

665
01:29:09,449 --> 01:29:13,681
Tomorrow, maybe I will allow the Turks
to buy you, friends of Feisal.

666
01:29:14,889 --> 01:29:16,083
But...

667
01:29:16,569 --> 01:29:17,797
...dine with me.

668
01:29:19,169 --> 01:29:20,522
Dine with Auda, English.

669
01:29:21,329 --> 01:29:23,718
Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.

670
01:29:24,489 --> 01:29:29,040
It is my pleasure that you dine
with me in Wadi Rumm!

671
01:32:02,169 --> 01:32:05,684
This thing you work against Aqaba...

672
01:32:06,049 --> 01:32:08,324
...what profit do you hope from it?

673
01:32:08,529 --> 01:32:11,043
We work it for Feisal of Mecca.

674
01:32:11,249 --> 01:32:13,285
The Harith do not work for profit.

675
01:32:14,409 --> 01:32:17,958
Well, if it is in a man to be
a servant, Sherif Ali...

676
01:32:18,449 --> 01:32:20,883
...he could find worse masters
than Feisal.

677
01:32:21,169 --> 01:32:23,922
But I....
I cannot serve.

678
01:32:24,769 --> 01:32:27,681
You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.

679
01:32:27,889 --> 01:32:29,845
Yes, it is my pleasure.

680
01:32:34,649 --> 01:32:37,959
We do not work this thing for Feisal.

681
01:32:38,449 --> 01:32:39,438
No?

682
01:32:40,449 --> 01:32:43,009
-For the English, then?
-For the Arabs.

683
01:32:43,569 --> 01:32:44,968
The Arabs?

684
01:32:45,729 --> 01:32:49,847
The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala,
Beni Sahkr, these I know.

685
01:32:50,049 --> 01:32:51,960
I have even heard of the Harith.

686
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:54,042
But the Arabs?

687
01:32:54,449 --> 01:32:56,565
What tribe is that?

688
01:32:58,169 --> 01:33:02,162
They're a tribe of slaves.
They serve the Turks.

689
01:33:02,369 --> 01:33:04,325
Well, they are nothing to me.

690
01:33:04,529 --> 01:33:06,360
My tribe is the Howeitat.

691
01:33:06,569 --> 01:33:08,799
Who work only for profit.

692
01:33:09,009 --> 01:33:10,601
Who work at Auda's pleasure.

693
01:33:10,809 --> 01:33:13,323
And Auda's pleasure is
to serve the Turks.

694
01:33:13,529 --> 01:33:14,644
Serve?

695
01:33:15,049 --> 01:33:16,084
I serve?

696
01:33:16,289 --> 01:33:18,849
It is the servant who takes money.

697
01:33:23,929 --> 01:33:25,567
I am Auda Abu Tayi.

698
01:33:25,849 --> 01:33:27,567
-Does Auda serve?
-No!

699
01:33:27,769 --> 01:33:30,806
-Does Auda Abu Tayi serve?
-No!

700
01:33:35,249 --> 01:33:39,208
I carry 23 great wounds,
all got in battle.

701
01:33:39,649 --> 01:33:43,005
75 men have I killed with
my own hands, in battle.

702
01:33:43,209 --> 01:33:47,202
I scatter, I burn my enemies tents.
I take away their flocks and herds.

703
01:33:47,409 --> 01:33:51,368
The Turks pay me a golden treasure,
yet I am poor!

704
01:33:51,569 --> 01:33:55,562
Because I am a river to my people.

705
01:34:03,929 --> 01:34:05,044
Is that service?

706
01:34:05,569 --> 01:34:06,763
No.

707
01:34:13,249 --> 01:34:16,605
And yet now it seems Auda
has grown old.

708
01:34:16,809 --> 01:34:19,403
And lost his taste for fighting.

709
01:34:19,609 --> 01:34:23,602
It is well you say it in my tent,
thou old tulip.

710
01:34:23,809 --> 01:34:27,404
Yet this is a tulip
that the Turks could not buy.

711
01:34:27,609 --> 01:34:29,327
Why should they wish to?

712
01:34:31,449 --> 01:34:32,438
Now....

713
01:34:33,009 --> 01:34:37,048
I will tell you what they pay me,
and you will tell me if this is...

714
01:34:37,249 --> 01:34:39,399
...a servant's wages.

715
01:34:39,609 --> 01:34:43,443
They pay me, month by month...

716
01:34:43,649 --> 01:34:47,562
...100 golden guineas.

717
01:34:48,729 --> 01:34:51,766
150, Auda.

718
01:34:51,969 --> 01:34:54,767
-Who told you that?
-I have long ears.

719
01:34:54,969 --> 01:34:57,164
And a long tongue between them.

720
01:34:57,369 --> 01:35:00,600
100, 150, what matters?
It's a trifle.

721
01:35:00,809 --> 01:35:04,438
A trifle which they take
f rom a great box they have.

722
01:35:04,649 --> 01:35:06,560
In Aqaba.

723
01:35:07,769 --> 01:35:10,363
-In Aqaba?
-Where else?

724
01:35:11,209 --> 01:35:13,962
You trouble me like women.

725
01:35:14,329 --> 01:35:17,366
Friends, we've been foolish.
Auda won't come to Aqaba.

726
01:35:18,009 --> 01:35:19,078
-For money?
-No.

727
01:35:19,449 --> 01:35:20,564
-For Feisal?
-No!

728
01:35:20,769 --> 01:35:23,681
Nor to drive away the Turks.

729
01:35:24,449 --> 01:35:26,246
He will come...

730
01:35:27,129 --> 01:35:29,359
...because it is his pleasure.

731
01:35:31,249 --> 01:35:34,764
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.

732
01:35:36,129 --> 01:35:39,405
Make God your agent!

733
01:35:40,729 --> 01:35:42,799
Aqaba!

734
01:35:43,009 --> 01:35:44,601
Aqaba!

735
01:35:59,649 --> 01:36:01,560
God be with you.

736
01:36:04,409 --> 01:36:06,001
God be with you.

737
01:36:18,929 --> 01:36:21,363
God be with you.

738
01:36:21,769 --> 01:36:23,760
God be with you.

739
01:39:12,129 --> 01:39:13,528
Yes.

740
01:39:13,809 --> 01:39:14,844
Aqaba.

741
01:39:16,409 --> 01:39:18,969
Tomorrow we will go and get it.

742
01:39:20,129 --> 01:39:22,927
-Do you think we shall?
-Yes.

743
01:39:23,129 --> 01:39:25,768
If you are right about the guns.

744
01:39:52,529 --> 01:39:55,168
He killed. He dies.

745
01:39:55,849 --> 01:39:57,965
This is the end of Aqaba.

746
01:40:00,529 --> 01:40:03,441
-One of our men murdered Auda's man.
-Why?

747
01:40:03,649 --> 01:40:06,561
Theft? Blood feud?
It makes no matter why.

748
01:40:07,009 --> 01:40:08,158
Ali!

749
01:40:08,569 --> 01:40:10,321
It is an ancient wound.

750
01:40:10,529 --> 01:40:13,362
I didn't come here to watch
a tribal bloodbath.

751
01:40:17,649 --> 01:40:19,719
It is the law, Lawrence.

752
01:40:19,929 --> 01:40:22,124
The law says the man must die.

753
01:40:23,049 --> 01:40:25,961
If he dies, will that
content the Howeitat?

754
01:40:26,929 --> 01:40:28,157
Yes.

755
01:40:31,489 --> 01:40:33,002
Sherif Ali!

756
01:40:33,209 --> 01:40:36,042
If none of Lord Auda's men harms
any of yours...

757
01:40:36,449 --> 01:40:39,521
-...will that content the Harith?
-Yes.

758
01:40:45,449 --> 01:40:47,963
Then I will execute the law.

759
01:40:48,929 --> 01:40:50,965
I have no tribe.

760
01:40:52,169 --> 01:40:54,364
And no one is offended.

761
01:41:06,289 --> 01:41:07,278
Gasim.

762
01:41:11,569 --> 01:41:12,968
Did you do it?

763
01:41:38,809 --> 01:41:40,367
Well, Lawrence....

764
01:41:47,569 --> 01:41:48,922
What ails the Englishman?

765
01:41:49,129 --> 01:41:52,439
That that he killed was the man
he brought out of the Nef ud.

766
01:41:52,649 --> 01:41:54,560
It was written, then.

767
01:41:55,369 --> 01:41:57,280
Better to have left him.

768
01:42:00,809 --> 01:42:03,960
It was execution, Lawrence.
No shame in that.

769
01:42:04,369 --> 01:42:06,564
Besides, it was necessary.

770
01:42:07,569 --> 01:42:09,719
You gave life and you took it.

771
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:11,762
The writing is still yours.

772
01:42:47,409 --> 01:42:49,445
Auda Abu Tayi!

773
01:45:57,449 --> 01:45:59,565
The miracle is accomplished.

774
01:46:00,529 --> 01:46:02,087
Garlands for the conqueror.
