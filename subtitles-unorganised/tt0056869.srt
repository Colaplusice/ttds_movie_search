00:28:32,598 --> 00:28:35,632
Mother, I'd like you
to meet Melanie Daniels.
Miss Daniels, my mother.

297
00:28:35,702 --> 00:28:38,189
How do you do?

298
00:28:38,261 --> 00:28:41,294
How do you do, Miss Daniels?
Acknowledge a what?

299
00:28:41,365 --> 00:28:44,594
A delivery.
Miss Daniels brought us
some birds from San Francisco.

300
00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:47,149
Oh.
For Cathy for her birthday.
Where is she?

301
00:28:47,221 --> 00:28:50,537
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Miss Daniels is staying
up here for the weekend.

302
00:28:50,613 --> 00:28:53,460
So I've already invited her
for dinner tonight.

303
00:28:57,237 --> 00:29:01,011
<i>- Well, you did go to the trouble
of bringing those birds.
- Oh, I couldn't possibly.</i>

304
00:29:01,077 --> 00:29:04,906
You did say birds?
Yes, lovebirds.

305
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:06,835
Oh, I see.

306
00:29:10,324 --> 00:29:13,739
<i>So we couldn't let you
get away without thanking you
in some small way.</i>

307
00:29:13,812 --> 00:29:15,951
And you haven't met Cathy,
and you are staying
the weekend.

308
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,354
<i>Well, yes, but...
You are, aren't you?</i>

309
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,591
<i>Certainly, but...
Then it's all settled.</i>

310
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:23,179
What time is dinner,
Mother?
7:00, the same as usual.

311
00:29:23,251 --> 00:29:26,568
- I'll pick you up.
Where are you staying?
- With Annie, of course.

312
00:29:26,643 --> 00:29:30,505
Oh, of course.
How stupid of me.
A quarter of 7:00?

313
00:29:30,579 --> 00:29:33,230
Annie may have
made other plans.
I'll have to see.

314
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,720
<i>Besides, I can find
my own way.</i>

315
00:29:35,795 --> 00:29:38,381
You're sure now?
You won't hire a boat
or anything?

316
00:29:38,451 --> 00:29:40,938
<i>I'm sure.
7:00, then.</i>

317
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,919
Maybe.

318
00:29:42,994 --> 00:29:45,165
We'll be waiting for you.
How's your head?

319
00:29:45,234 --> 00:29:47,144
<i>Much better, thank you.</i>

320
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:50,186
A gull hit me,
Mrs. Brenner, that's all.

321
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:57,385
<i>[Rings]</i>

322
00:30:03,122 --> 00:30:06,667
Oh, hi.
Did you find her all right?
Yes, I did.

323
00:30:06,737 --> 00:30:08,876
I was wondering...

324
00:30:08,946 --> 00:30:11,662
Uh, that sign there.

325
00:30:11,729 --> 00:30:15,176
Do you suppose
I could have the room
for just a single night?

326
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:18,118
I was planning on renting it
for a longer time...
I would appreciate it.

327
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:21,390
I've tried
everywhere in town.
They're all full.

328
00:30:21,457 --> 00:30:24,490
Well, all right.
Got your bags in the car?

329
00:30:25,776 --> 00:30:28,623
[Chuckles]
Well, it's utilitarian,
I'll say that.

330
00:30:28,688 --> 00:30:31,503
I just picked up
some things for the night
at the general store.

331
00:30:31,568 --> 00:30:34,470
I hadn't planned
on staying very long.

332
00:30:34,544 --> 00:30:38,221
Yes, I know.
Did something
unexpected come up?

333
00:30:39,856 --> 00:30:42,987
Yes. May I use your phone?
I'd like to call home.

334
00:30:43,055 --> 00:30:46,154
I just put some coffee
on the stove.

335
00:30:46,224 --> 00:30:50,152
<i>[Seagulls Cawing]
Don't they ever
stop migrating?</i>

336
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:13,770
<i>[Seagulls Cawing]</i>

337
00:31:31,053 --> 00:31:32,908
[Rings]

338
00:31:43,245 --> 00:31:45,132
Hi!

339
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:49,417
Hi!

340
00:31:49,485 --> 00:31:51,590
<i>Miss Daniels?
Yes.</i>

341
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,947
Oh, they're beautiful!

342
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,867
They're just what I wanted.
Is there a man and a woman?

343
00:31:57,932 --> 00:32:01,761
<i>[Cathy]
I can't tell which is which.
Well, I suppose so.</i>

344
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:04,323
<i>Hello there.
Annie had no plans, huh?
No.</i>

345
00:32:04,396 --> 00:32:06,251
We're very glad
you could come.
Are you hungry?

346
00:32:06,316 --> 00:32:08,487
Reasonably.
Dinner's just
about ready.

347
00:32:08,555 --> 00:32:10,792
We've been looking
at the chickens. Something
seems to be wrong with them.

348
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,747
There's nothing wrong
with those chickens.

349
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:15,364
I'm going to call
Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
What good's that gonna do?

350
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:17,355
The chickens won't eat.

351
00:32:17,483 --> 00:32:19,621
He sold the feed to me,
didn't he?

352
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,171
Caveat emptor, Mother.
Let the buyer beware.
Whose side are you on?

353
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:26,374
Merely quoting
the law, dear.
Never mind the law.

354
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:37,346
This won't take long,
Miss Dan... Hello, Fred?
Lydia Brenner.

355
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:39,457
I didn't interrupt
your dinner, did I?
How about a drink?

356
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,458
I'd love one.
That feed you
sold me is no good.

357
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:48,580
The chicken feed.
Well, it's just no good.
The chickens won't eat it.

358
00:32:48,649 --> 00:32:50,656
They're always hungry.

359
00:32:50,729 --> 00:32:53,696
I opened a sack for them
when I got home, and they
just wouldn't touch it.

360
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:55,940
You know chickens
as well as I do,
and when they won't eat,

361
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:59,140
there's something wrong
with what they're being fed.

362
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:02,983
No, they're not
fussy chickens.

363
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:06,082
Who? What's he
got to do with it?

364
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:08,803
Is that your father?
Mm-hmm.
Please sit down.

365
00:33:08,872 --> 00:33:12,898
I don't care how many sacks
of feed you sold him.
My chicken...

366
00:33:14,664 --> 00:33:17,697
Oh, I see.

367
00:33:17,768 --> 00:33:20,004
Dan Fawcett.

368
00:33:20,072 --> 00:33:23,868
This afternoon?
That proves what I'm saying.
The feed you sold us...

369
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:29,218
Oh.

370
00:33:29,288 --> 00:33:32,735
Well, maybe I better
go over and see him.

371
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:36,419
You don't think
there's something
going around, do you?

372
00:33:36,487 --> 00:33:38,821
No, never!

373
00:33:38,887 --> 00:33:43,077
No, they don't
seem sick at all.
They just won't eat.

374
00:33:43,143 --> 00:33:46,339
Uh-huh.

375
00:33:46,407 --> 00:33:50,814
Well, I'll try
to go over and see him.
Maybe he...

376
00:33:50,886 --> 00:33:53,668
Uh-huh.
All right.

377
00:33:53,734 --> 00:33:56,123
Thanks.

378
00:33:57,894 --> 00:34:00,676
He had a call from
Dan Fawcett a while ago.

379
00:34:00,742 --> 00:34:02,596
His chickens
won't eat either.

380
00:34:02,662 --> 00:34:05,957
It's what you said, Mom.
Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed
is no good.

381
00:34:06,022 --> 00:34:09,535
No, Cathy.
He sold Mr. Fawcett
a different brand.

382
00:34:09,606 --> 00:34:12,901
You don't think
they're getting sick,
do you, Mitch?

383
00:34:18,597 --> 00:34:23,234
I still don't understand
how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
Your brother told me.

384
00:34:23,301 --> 00:34:26,978
Then you knew Mitch
in San Francisco?
Is that right?

385
00:34:27,045 --> 00:34:28,987
No, not exactly.

386
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:33,600
Mitch knows a lot
of people in San Francisco.
Of course, they're mostly hoods.

387
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:37,465
- Cathy!
- Well, Mom, he's
the first to admit it.

388
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,086
He's spends half his day
in the detention cells
at the Hall of Justice.

389
00:34:41,156 --> 00:34:44,319
In a democracy, Cathy,
everyone is entitled
to a fair trial.

390
00:34:44,387 --> 00:34:47,038
<i>Your brother's
practice...
Aw, Mom, please!</i>

391
00:34:47,108 --> 00:34:50,174
I know all
that democracy jazz.
They're still hoods.

392
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:56,220
He has a client now
who shot his wife
in the head six times.

393
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:59,259
Six times!
Can you imagine it?

394
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:03,226
I mean, even twice
would be overdoing it,
don't you think?

395
00:35:03,299 --> 00:35:06,648
- Why did he shoot her?
- He was watching
a ball game on television.

396
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,592
- What?
- His wife changed the channel.

397
00:35:11,555 --> 00:35:14,850
Are you coming
to my party tomorrow?
I don't think so.

398
00:35:14,914 --> 00:35:17,248
I have to get back
to San Francisco.

399
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,224
Don't you like us?

400
00:35:19,298 --> 00:35:21,632
Oh, darling,
of course I do.

401
00:35:21,698 --> 00:35:24,415
<i>Don't you like
Bodega Bay?
I don't know yet.</i>

402
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:27,864
Mitch likes it very much.
He comes up every weekend,
you know,

403
00:35:27,937 --> 00:35:30,687
<i>even though he has
his own apartment
in the city.</i>

404
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:33,983
<i>He says San Francisco's
like an anthill
at the foot of a bridge.</i>

405
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,470
I suppose it does get
hectic at times.

406
00:35:36,545 --> 00:35:40,702
Well, if you do decide to come,
don't say I told you about it.

407
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:42,874
It's supposed to be
a surprise party.

408
00:35:42,945 --> 00:35:45,944
<i>They've got
this whole complicated
thing figured out...</i>

409
00:35:46,017 --> 00:35:48,351
where I'm going to Michele's
for the afternoon,

410
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:52,345
and Michele's mother will say
that she has a headache, would
I mind if she took me home.

411
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:55,319
Then when I get home here,
all the kids'll jump out!

412
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,182
Oh, won't you come?
Won't you please come?

413
00:36:03,808 --> 00:36:05,695
I don't think so.

414
00:36:07,872 --> 00:36:11,254
<i>She's a charming girl,
isn't she, Mitch?
Hmm? Yes.</i>

415
00:36:11,328 --> 00:36:13,597
<i>Certainly pretty.
Mm-hmm.</i>

416
00:36:13,663 --> 00:36:17,525
- How long have you known her?
- Now, I told you, dear,
we met yesterday.

417
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,704
<i>In a bird shop.
In a bird shop.</i>

418
00:36:19,775 --> 00:36:21,630
She was selling birds?

419
00:36:21,695 --> 00:36:25,753
No, no. I just led her
into believing that I believed
she was, and then...

420
00:36:25,823 --> 00:36:29,500
<i>It's all very complicated.
But she did buy the lovebirds
and then drove all the way here.</i>

421
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:31,422
<i>Mother.
Yes?</i>

422
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:34,716
Where did you
go to law school?

423
00:36:34,782 --> 00:36:36,637
Forgive me.

424
00:36:36,702 --> 00:36:40,084
I suppose I'm
just naturally curious
about a girl like that.

425
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:42,013
She's very rich,
isn't she?

426
00:36:42,078 --> 00:36:45,526
Yeah, I suppose so.
Her father's part owner of
one of the big newspapers.

427
00:36:45,598 --> 00:36:48,631
You'd think he could manage
to keep her name out of print.

428
00:36:48,702 --> 00:36:52,477
She's always mentioned
in the columns, Mitch.
Yes, I know.

429
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:57,211
She is the one who jumped
into a fountain in Rome
last summer, isn't she?

430
00:36:57,277 --> 00:36:59,132
Yes.

431
00:36:59,197 --> 00:37:03,605
I supposed I'm old-fashioned.
I know it was supposed to be
very warm there, but...

432
00:37:03,677 --> 00:37:07,986
Well, actually the newspapers
said she was naked.
Yes, I know, dear.

433
00:37:08,061 --> 00:37:10,778
It's none of my business,
but when you bring
a girl like that...

434
00:37:10,845 --> 00:37:13,016
<i>Darling?
Yes?</i>

435
00:37:13,084 --> 00:37:16,630
I think I can handle
Melanie Daniels by myself.

436
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:20,475
Well... as long as you know
what you want, Mitch.

437
00:37:21,853 --> 00:37:24,340
I know exactly
what I want.

438
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,636
Be able to find
your way back all right?
Oh, yes.

439
00:37:34,716 --> 00:37:38,011
Will I be seeing you again?
San Francisco's
a long way from here.

440
00:37:38,076 --> 00:37:40,629
I'm in San Francisco
five days a week with a lot
of time on my hands.

441
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,180
I'd like to see you.
Maybe we could go swimming
or something.

442
00:37:44,251 --> 00:37:46,672
Mother tells me
you like to swim.

443
00:37:46,747 --> 00:37:50,325
How does Mother know
what I like to do?
We read the same gossip column.

444
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:54,585
Oh, that... Rome.
I really like to swim.
We might get along very well.

445
00:37:54,651 --> 00:37:58,164
In case you're interested,
I was pushed into that fountain.
Without any clothes on?

446
00:37:58,235 --> 00:38:01,050
With all my clothes on.
The newspaper that ran
that story...

447
00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:03,122
happens to be a rival
of my father's paper.

448
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:06,489
You were just a poor, innocent
victim of circumstances?
I'm neither poor nor innocent.

449
00:38:06,554 --> 00:38:09,849
The truth of that particular...
The truth is, you're running
around with a pretty wild crowd.

450
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:13,045
Yes, that's the truth, but I
was pushed into that fountain,
and that's the truth too.

451
00:38:13,114 --> 00:38:16,375
Uh-huh. Do you really
know Annie Hayworth?

452
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:18,830
No. At least I didn't
until I came up here.

453
00:38:18,905 --> 00:38:20,760
So you didn't go
to school together?
No.

454
00:38:20,825 --> 00:38:22,680
And you didn't come here
to see her?
No!

455
00:38:22,745 --> 00:38:24,654
You were lying!
Yes, I was lying.

456
00:38:24,729 --> 00:38:27,282
What about the letter
you wrote me? Is that a lie?
No, I wrote the letter.

457
00:38:27,353 --> 00:38:30,484
- Well, what did it say?
- It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner.

458
00:38:30,553 --> 00:38:34,099
I think you need
these lovebirds after all.
They may help your personality."

459

<i>That's what it said.
But you tore it up?</i>

460

<i>Yes.
Why?</i>

461
00:38:37,465 --> 00:38:39,636
Because it seemed
stupid and foolish.

462
00:38:39,705 --> 00:38:42,705
- Like jumping into
a fountain in Rome.
- I told you what happened!

463
00:38:42,776 --> 00:38:43,824
You don't expect me
to believe that, do you?

464
00:38:43,897 --> 00:38:45,839
I don't give a damn
what you believe!

465
00:38:45,912 --> 00:38:48,301
- I'd still like to see you.
- Why?

466
00:38:48,376 --> 00:38:49,805
I think it might be fun.

467
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,141
That might've been
good enough in Rome,
but it's not good enough now.

468
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,670
<i>It is for me.
Well, not for me.</i>

469
00:38:54,744 --> 00:38:57,013
- What do you want?
- I thought you knew.

470
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:01,487
I want to go through life...
jumping into fountains naked.

Is that cut beginning
to bother you?

479

No. No, thank you.

481

<i>All right.</i>

<i>Did you meet Lydia?</i>

Or would you rather
I changed the subject?

487
00:40:14,772 --> 00:40:16,714
I think so.

488
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:22,923
- Well, how do you like
our little hamlet?
- I despise it.

491

How did you happen
to come up here?

494
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:43,978
A friend invited me
up for a weekend
a long time ago.

495
00:40:45,171 --> 00:40:47,757
Look, I see no reason
for being coy about this.

496
00:40:47,827 --> 00:40:51,372
<i>It was Mitch Brenner.

<i>Annie, there's nothing
between Mr. Brenner and me.
Isn't there?</i>

500
00:41:01,394 --> 00:41:03,946
Well, maybe there isn't.

501
00:41:04,017 --> 00:41:06,570
Maybe there's
never been anything
between Mitch and any girl.

502
00:41:06,642 --> 00:41:09,392
What do you mean?

503
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:12,425
I think I'll have
some of that.

504
00:41:12,498 --> 00:41:15,148
I was seeing a lot of him
in San Francisco.

505
00:41:15,217 --> 00:41:17,322
One weekend, he invited me
up to meet Lydia.

506
00:41:17,393 --> 00:41:22,412
- When was this?
- Oh, four years ago,
shortly after his father died.

507
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:26,572
<i>Of course, things
may be different now.
Different?</i>

508
00:41:26,641 --> 00:41:29,259
With Lydia.

509
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:33,191
<i>Did she seem
a trifle distant?
Mm, a trifle.</i>

510
00:41:33,265 --> 00:41:36,429
Well, then perhaps things
aren't quite so different.

511
00:41:36,497 --> 00:41:39,845
<i>You know, her attitude
nearly drove me crazy.</i>

512
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,342
When I got back to
San Francisco, I spent days
trying to figure out...

513
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,270
what I'd done
to displease her.

514
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:48,110
- Well, what had you done?
- Nothing.

515
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:52,682
I simply existed.
So what's the answer?
Ajealous woman, right?

516
00:41:52,752 --> 00:41:54,639
<i>A clinging,
possessive mother?</i>

517
00:41:54,703 --> 00:41:58,565
Wrong. With all due respect
to Oedipus, I don't think
that was the case.

518
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:01,541
Then what was it?

519
00:42:01,615 --> 00:42:04,484
Lydia liked me.
That's the strange part.

520
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:07,373
Now that I'm no longer a threat,
we're very good friends.

521
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:11,694
- Then why did she
object to you?
- Because she was afraid.

522
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:15,817
<i>- Afraid you'd take Mitch?
- Afraid I'd give Mitch.</i>

523
00:42:15,886 --> 00:42:17,741
<i>I don't understand.</i>

524
00:42:17,806 --> 00:42:21,734
<i>Afraid of any woman who
would give Mitch the one thing
Lydia can give him: Love.</i>

525
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:24,228
That adds up to
a jealous, possessive woman.

526
00:42:24,302 --> 00:42:27,269
No, I don't think so.

527
00:42:27,342 --> 00:42:30,375
You see, she's not afraid
of losing Mitch.

528
00:42:30,446 --> 00:42:32,650
She's only afraid
of being abandoned.

529
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:36,973
- Someone ought to tell her
she'd be gaining a daughter.
- [Chuckles]

00:42:37,037 --> 00:42:39,884
No. She already
has a daughter.

531
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:44,739
Well, what about Mitch?
Didn't he have anything
to say about this?

532
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:47,300
Well, I can understand
his position.

533
00:42:47,373 --> 00:42:50,056
He'd just been through
a lot with Lydia
after his father died.

534
00:42:50,124 --> 00:42:53,353
- He didn't want to risk
going through it all again.

saw each other now and then,
but we both knew it was over.

537
00:43:00,684 --> 00:43:05,092

here in Bodega Bay?
- I wanted to be near Mitch.

1047

A large flock of seagulls
got lost in a fog,

1048
01:19:53,795 --> 01:19:56,315
and headed into the town
where all the lights were.
