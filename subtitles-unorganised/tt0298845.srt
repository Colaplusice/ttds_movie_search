{764}{836}There are some things you should wish for...
{856}{912}...and some things you shouldn't.
{1006}{1084}That's what my little brother Frankie told me.
{1206}{1268}He told me I only had just three wishes.
{1327}{1377}And I looked in his eyes.
{1413}{1461}And I don't know why I believed him.
{2379}{2480}- Remember, we're on holiday, all right?|- Knock it off, Christy, love.
{2508}{2587}All those with U.S. passports,|use the two left lanes.
{2761}{2847}- Passports, please.|- We're on holidays!
{2868}{2955}- Are you, little girl?|- Yes. And my dad's not working.
{3289}{3337}What are your purposes in visiting the U.S.?
{3339}{3364}We're on holidays.
{3366}{3431}- How long have you been in Canada?|- Just visiting.
{3433}{3473}Listening to my mom and dad...
{3475}{3524}We got the car in Canada.
{3526}{3609}...I was scared we weren't gonna|get across the border.
{3624}{3739}And if I didn't talk to Frankie,|how were we going to get into America?
{3793}{3868}"Please, Frankie. Please.
{3887}{3926}"Please help us," I said.
{3928}{3990}- How many children do you have?|- Three.
{3992}{4019}Two.
{4074}{4101}Two.
{4124}{4203}- It says three here.|- We lost one.
{4472}{4538}- What's your name, little girl?|- Ariel.
{4597}{4637}And who are you?
{4694}{4731}She's Christy.
{4748}{4813}- What age are you, Christy?|- She's 10.
{4939}{5005}- Welcome to America.|- Thanks very much.
{5227}{5289}And that was my first wish used up.
{5313}{5363}But I still had two left.
{5512}{5580}We heard Manhattan before we ever saw it.
{5582}{5661}A thousand strange voices coming|from everywhere.
{5746}{5797}And you're not going to believe this...
{5799}{5868}...but we had to go under the water|to get to the city.
{5870}{5949}{y:i}No, I swear it. It was a real alien.
{5959}{6022}And we lost contact with everything.
{6031}{6097}It was like we were on another planet.
{6543}{6621}{y:i}--classics from the '60s, '70s, '80s, and '90s--
{8514}{8593}We looked all over Manhattan for a place to live...
{8600}{8706}...until finally we found the house|of the man who screams.
{8796}{8873}What are you doing with the camera, little girl?
{8903}{8944}- You the police?|- What?
{8946}{8977}Fingers.
{8987}{9052}- Are you the police?|- No, we're Irish.
{9061}{9121}- All Irish are police.|- We're not.
{9125}{9181}Are we going to live here now?
{9184}{9255}- You're gonna live in here in this building?|- Yeah.
{9289}{9382}All right. Keep an eye on the car.|Papo's gonna keep you safe now.
{9389}{9471}All right? Come on in.|Welcome to your new mansion.
{9590}{9621}Come on.
{9648}{9696}Look, a lift!
{9760}{9823}That hasn't worked forever. Come on.
{10116}{10163}- Are we going to live here now?|- Yeah.
{10165}{10222}- Why?|- Nowhere else will take us.
{10225}{10298}- Why?|- They don't want kids in Manhattan.
{10300}{10382}- Why?|- Why do you think it's called "Man"hattan?
{10520}{10577}Papo, don't come any further, man.
{10579}{10656}Relax, Tony. it's just me.
{10658}{10722}I know who it is.|Go back downstairs to your apartment.
{10724}{10804}I'm clean, man. I'm showing this family|the empty apartment.
{10806}{10865}- No way, Papo.|- All right.
{10867}{10939}All right, Papo. We'll take over from here.
{11068}{11153}- Why does he scream?|- Maybe he sees ghosts.
{11170}{11219}Is this a haunted house?
{11428}{11479}- It's like Fort Knox.|- Cool.
{11481}{11533}- Where did you learn that?|- What?
{11535}{11590}- "Cool."|- I just heard it.
{11592}{11662}You're American already. It's disgusting.
{11685}{11755}- Race you in, Christy.|- It's huge!
{11757}{11807}I know. It's enormous.
{11809}{11855}- This is my room.|- It's big, girls.
{11857}{11910}- This is my room.|- I get top bunk.
{11912}{11995}Look, Dad. There's a bath in the middle of the room.
{12074}{12153}There's pigeons! Ariel, look at this.
{12158}{12245}- It's a bit of a hole.|- It'll be fine when we do it up.
{12277}{12322}It'll cost us, Sarah.
{12411}{12474}How are we gonna pay for this place?
{12491}{12534}We'll sell the car.
{12615}{12658}- Are you okay?|- Yeah, good.
{12660}{12696}- Are you?|- I'm great.
{12698}{12729}Are you?
{12828}{12876}- Dad?|- What?
{12883}{12932}Can we keep the pigeons?
{12983}{13038}Dad, can we keep the pigeons?
{13136}{13191}No, we have to leave them go.
{13492}{13576}It seemed like all our problems were flying away.
{13752}{13839}- Dad, can I help?|- Go and ask your mom.
{13879}{13942}- Mom, can I help?|- Why don't you go on your skates?
{13944}{14006}I'll fast forward through this bit.
{14359}{14437}Ariel got to know everybody in the neighbourhood.
{14630}{14683}My mom couldn't get a job teaching.
{14685}{14792}So she got a job in the ice-cream parlor|so Dad could go to auditions.
{14922}{14976}I really like the character.
{14986}{15030}I'm glad you asked me back.
{15032}{15103}I just wanna say I'm real pleased about that.
{15148}{15195}Has he looked at the part of Vinny?
{15197}{15270}The New York guy? He's a bit of a stereotype.
{15272}{15332}But if you want him, you got him.
{15365}{15417}Can you do a London accent?
{15442}{15495}You having a laugh? He's only got two lines.
{15497}{15576}Do you want me to come up there|and sort you out?
{15643}{15688}- Do you like him?|- Yeah.
{15690}{15761}But acting's about more than just accents.
{15777}{15867}I wanted to cast you.|But you've got to give me much more.
{15869}{15910}Don't you understand?
{15912}{15999}Get it out of your head.|It's from here and from here.
{16007}{16058}Just give me one more chance.
{16072}{16129}But he didn't get another chance.
{16131}{16227}And then summer came. And with it, the heat.
{16298}{16369}And a new word: humidity.
{16442}{16504}- Dad, it's still not working.|- Wait.
{16650}{16686}It's too hot.
{16781}{16871}- It's still not coming through the holes.|- Hang on there.
{16942}{17003}Wait.
{17021}{17071}It's coming.
{17187}{17223}It's working.
{17324}{17406}- Well done, Dad. It's lovely and cold.|- I love you.
{17483}{17544}Ariel, Dad has an audition.
{17551}{17585}- Dad!|- What?
{17624}{17696}- What are you doing?|- I'm reading my scripts.
{17710}{17773}- Why?|- Because I'm learning my lines.
{17906}{17965}Dad, can we stay here all day?
{18064}{18129}- Dad, America's okay.|- Great.
{18162}{18196}- Dad?|- What?
{18208}{18239}Nothing.
{18690}{18738}What are we doing here?
{19005}{19048}Dad, Ariel's upset.
{19063}{19151}- She's been too long in the bath.|- What's wrong with you?
{19153}{19194}- My feet are like prunes.|- What?
{19196}{19232}They're like prunes.
{19234}{19293}Oh, Jesus. Where's your ma?
{19538}{19574}Are you okay?
{19671}{19707}It's too hot.
{19799}{19905}Dad, how are you gonna get that|air conditioner up and down the path?
{19956}{20007}Dad, how are you gonna--
{20078}{20109}Come on!
{20206}{20253}Dad, they're gonna shoot you.
{20483}{20520}- Dad, look out!|- Asshole!
{20648}{20686}Look, it's Dad.
{20800}{20882}- You're using, Papo.|- No.
{20887}{20925}Don't you walk--
{20989}{21052}Can I have some of whatever he's on?
{21064}{21105}Crazy, fucking Irishman.
{21743}{21791}Christy, open the door.
{21795}{21885}Mom, Dad's got an air conditioner!
{21887}{21937}He's coming!
{22010}{22085}- Walk away from me! Go on.|- Jesus! You'll have a heart attack.
{22108}{22175}- Open the window.|- Open the window, Mom!
{23420}{23455}What's wrong?
{23505}{23540}Wrong plug.
{23651}{23685}25 cents short.
{23687}{23764}That's no use to me.|I got to make a living. $1.99.
{23780}{23835}I'll give it to you tomorrow.
{23850}{23926}- You're from the junkies' building, right?|- So?
{23941}{23977}Look at that.
{24003}{24069}That's from holding the knife of a junkie.
{24071}{24134}I got 25 stitches. He got probation.
{24237}{24294}Do I look like a junkie to you?
{24366}{24409}$1.99.
{24989}{25071}- What's that?|- There's 5 cents on each of those.
{25100}{25207}- Where's the $100 I gave you?|-I put it in the bank like you insisted.
{25658}{25694}And 25 cents.
{25780}{25868}And $2. Mr. American Dream.
{25878}{25914}And one plug.
{25962}{25998}And 1 cent.
{26125}{26195}Dad, don't worry. Mom's breathing's okay.
{26197}{26231}Is it okay?
{26273}{26314}It's the lemon drops. They're magic.
{26316}{26398}You take them,|and you forget about your breathing.
{26619}{26660}Say your prayers.
{26784}{26821}It's all right.
{26926}{26985}Go on, get your head in there. Is that good?
{26987}{27032}Is that lovely? Yeah?
{27046}{27086}- Get a load of that!|- Get Christy!
{27088}{27163}Come on, get your face in there. Look at that.
{27202}{27246}You're a genius, Dad.
{27420}{27457}Hey, gringo!
{27459}{27530}Gringo, what the hell's going on up there?
{27616}{27685}We got out of there as fast as we could.
{27711}{27787}We went to the bank, took out our money...
{27802}{27885}...and went to the movies|where it was lovely and cool.
{28624}{28699}Listen, don't be upset. E.T.'s gone to Heaven.
{28712}{28803}- But they said he went home.|- Well, that's the same thing.
{28869}{28901}It's not.
{29018}{29055}I miss things.
{29125}{29166}What do you miss?
{29182}{29266}Things. I have no one to play with.
{29299}{29406}- You have your sister to play with.|- No. She plays with her camcorder.
{29435}{29501}And I have no one to tell my secrets to.
{29513}{29575}Christy tells them to her camcorder.
{29598}{29667}And she won't let me hear what she says.
{29704}{29769}And you don't play with us anymore.
{29847}{29934}- I do play with you.|- Not like you used to.
{30149}{30184}Here you go!
{30274}{30349}Step right up, pop the balloon to win a prize.
{30391}{30444}- Pick a number.|- Dad!
{30465}{30542}Dad, you can win E.T.!
{30657}{30762}It's a game of chance. It's as simple as pie.
{30764}{30833}Just throw the ball|through the hoop seven times...
{30835}{30905}- ...and you win E.T.|- Seven times? Is that all?
{30929}{30971}- Can adults play?|- Sure.
{30973}{31018}- Simple as pie.|- That's $2.
{31020}{31078}Keep throwing as long as|you double up your dollars.
{31080}{31146}If you win, you get the money back|and any prize you like.
{31148}{31254}- You get all your money back if you win?|- Yes. And any doll you like.
{31364}{31389}Yes!
{31391}{31446}- That's one.|- Come on, Johnny.
{31562}{31639}- Two down. Five to go. $4.|- Come on, we'll get there.
{31641}{31701}Come on, Dad. You're excellent. You're brilliant.
{31703}{31755}All right, don't worry. I'll get it in.
{31757}{31841}- Mom, is Dad going to win?|- Of course he is, darling.
{31914}{31954}Come on, Dad.
{31993}{32026}Yes!
{32028}{32092}Three, four, five. Very good. Only two to go.
{32221}{32258}$8.
{32327}{32381}Game of chance. Simple as pie.
{32383}{32453}You can keep throwing|as long as you double up your dollars.
{32455}{32483}Shit!
{32487}{32570}- Number five, two to go. $16.|- Let's go for it.
{32593}{32707}- Come on, Dad. Only two more to go.|- All right. I'll get this. Don't worry.
{32761}{32857}$32. We got $32 over here.
{32861}{32951}- I don't need a crowd.|- Well, you're the main attraction.
{33060}{33126}Game of chance. Simple as pie.
{33406}{33476}$64. Are we finished, sir?
{33499}{33549}Angela. Over here.
{33593}{33632}I got $55.
{33634}{33713}- Here,I have another $5.|- Just need $4 more.
{33715}{33792}- Dad, it doesn't matter.|- No.
{33795}{33840}Just take it, Johnny.
{33853}{33934}And $1 change for the big girl. Only one to go.
{33936}{34019}One ball to go for the big doll|for the little girl.
{34027}{34103}Don't let him break your|concentration, Johnny.
{34353}{34414}- Give me the rent money.|- What?
{34447}{34542}- Give me the rent money.|- Please don't do this to me tonight.
{34553}{34629}I can't lose in front of the kids again, Sarah.
{35073}{35140}Wait a minute. We got $128 over here.
{35163}{35197}Go on, Dad.
{35394}{35480}- We're finished now, sir.|- Leave it, please.
{35549}{35591}Go for it, man!
{35720}{35774}We can't blow all our money.
{35799}{35905}I believe in you, the kids believe in you,|and you can win that doll.
{35914}{35984}- Go on.|- You're gonna win. I just know it.
{36262}{36365}And then I used all my willpower|to quieten the crowd.
{36504}{36547}But it didn't work.
{37084}{37161}Every cent of every penny we owned...
{37163}{37246}...was down for an E.T. doll worth $30.
{37290}{37325}So I said:
{37344}{37435}"Frankie, I have to ask you for a second wish."
{37640}{37763}And to this day, my dad still believes|it was him who won the E.T. doll.
{38378}{38453}Fee, fie, foe...
{38470}{38491}...fum!
{38504}{38586}I smell the blood of an Irishwoman!
{38640}{38686}Give me a bite of you!
{38715}{38761}Come on, Christy. Come on.
{38763}{38798}Run, E.T.!
{38846}{38887}Help! Ariel!
{38920}{38996}Fee, fie, foe, fum!
{39003}{39086}I smell the blood of an Irishwoman!
{39331}{39397}Run, E.T., it's the monster!
{39399}{39481}Fee, fie, foe, fum!
{39518}{39606}I smell the blood of an Irishman!
{40135}{40226}- Johnny, what's wrong?|- I was looking for him.
{40362}{40413}I was looking for Frankie.
{40495}{40553}Just play with the kids, Johnny.
{40601}{40645}I couldn't find him.
{40684}{40726}Am I going insane?
{40783}{40835}Just act, Johnny. Just act.
{40873}{40908}Go on, love.
{41035}{41132}Fee, fie, foe, fum!
{41212}{41276}I still smell the blood...
{41319}{41361}...of an Irishwoman!
{41419}{41481}Come on, give me your finger.
{41530}{41578}Christy, I'll save you!
{41844}{41886}No, get off her now, Dad!
{41976}{42019}You didn't find me.
{42043}{42093}I wasn't looking for you.
{42162}{42239}Exactly. You weren't looking for me.
{42279}{42361}There's nowhere you could hide|I wouldn't find you.
{42602}{42708}Fee, fie, foe, fum!
{42747}{42841}- Girls.|- I still smell the blood of an Irishwoman.
{42890}{42998}Take the bag. Take the money.|Go to Heaven. Marina will look after you.
{43015}{43105}I smell the blood of an Irishwoman.
{43199}{43259}- Hi, you two.|- How are you doing, girls?
{43267}{43336}You're a little later than usual. Where's your mom?
{43338}{43404}My mom is playing with Dad on her own.
{43460}{43521}Fee, fie...
{43523}{43610}...foe, fum!
{43630}{43736}I smell the blood of an Irishwoman.
{44077}{44164}Fee, fie...
{44188}{44265}...foe, fum!
{44294}{44345}I still smell the blood...
{44379}{44426}...of an Irishwoman.
{44551}{44611}- Where are the kids?|- Leave it on.
{44660}{44711}It's all right. It's okay.
{44997}{45040}- Where are the kids?|- They're fine.
{45042}{45096}They're in Heaven. Marina's looking after them.
{45348}{45408}- Come on to me. Come on.|- No!
{47784}{47861}And that was the moment the baby was conceived.
{48291}{48327}What's wrong?
{48388}{48429}Was it that good?
{48499}{48538}Was it that bad?
{48587}{48629}Look at me, Sarah.
{48714}{48756}Are you all right?
{48850}{48886}What's wrong?
{49013}{49053}Come here to me.
{49077}{49108}I can't.
{49153}{49193}Come here to me.
{49283}{49343}Look at me and tell me the truth.
{49598}{49654}Frankie had your eyes, Johnny.
{49974}{50011}Say something.
{50132}{50168}You blame me.
{50219}{50322}I should have been there to catch him|when he fell down the stairs.
{50341}{50378}It's my fault.
{50411}{50453}I don't blame you.
{51547}{51649}We had to go to a Catholic school.|So my dad took a night job.
{51666}{51745}Ariel was worried about a blind man called Jos.
{51753}{51819}Everybody smile and say "cheese."
{51821}{51880}Cheese!
{51884}{51940}Christy, why can Jos not see?
{51967}{52005}It's not Jos, it's:
{52007}{52066}{y:i}O say can you see
{52372}{52403}I helped, too.
{52416}{52474}Fill the bag with these, like that. Yellow ones.
{52476}{52504}Okay.
{52718}{52757}Statue of Liberty.
{52759}{52852}Nation, friends, and caring.
{52863}{52954}So now we're all together.
{52991}{53021}I'm hungry!
{53038}{53079}Keep your eye on the meter.
{53081}{53142}And get in the cab|and keep your ear on the radio.
{53144}{53207}I won't be long. And lock the doors.
{53321}{53421}401 to Base. If you can hear me, come in.
{53438}{53519}Hello, Base here. Where's your dad, girls?
{53528}{53573}He's in his audition.
{53609}{53692}- Where are you?|- I'm not positive.
{53708}{53770}Christy, do you know where you are?
{53804}{53829}No.
{53860}{53888}Are you on Broadway?
{53890}{53937}- Yeah.|- I think so.
{53944}{53974}Near where?
{54017}{54076}- Near the audition.|- Yeah. Very good.
{54236}{54281}Is my baby all right?
{54354}{54397}How are you feeling?
{54400}{54487}Fine. A little bit tired.|But other than that, I'm okay.
{54990}{55059}Mom, do you think Dad will know who I am?
{55169}{55236}You look great. You'll knock them out.
{55269}{55368}- Can you guess what they are?|- Ariel's an angel.
{55409}{55462}Christy's a forest.
{55472}{55519}- She's autumn.|- No, fall.
{55536}{55621}That's what they call it here in America.|Fall. Like leaves fall.
{55623}{55679}You guys look great. They look great.
{55681}{55781}- Irish. Spare a quarter, please?|- I got a quarter.
{55789}{55864}You're the best. He gave me a quarter, Angela.
{55882}{55913}He gave me a quarter.
{55915}{55974}- There you go.|- Thank you, sir.
{56560}{56638}- Who are they?|- That's the Irish.
{56677}{56713}What's wrong?
{56820}{56889}Everyone else has bought their costumes.
{56921}{56988}- We look stupid.|- No, you don't.
{57168}{57242}And last but not least,|a special prize this year...
{57244}{57336}...for the best homemade costume|goes to the Sullivan sisters.
{57542}{57602}You can't throw away your prize.
{57604}{57678}- Best homemade costume.|- They made it up because they pity us.
{57680}{57755}- You got it 'cause you're different.|- We don't want to be.
{57757}{57806}We want to be the same as everybody else.
{57808}{57866}Why would you wanna be the same|as everybody else?
{57868}{57952}- Everybody else goes trick-or-treating.|- What's that?
{57962}{58010}It's what they do here for Halloween.
{58012}{58069}Like "Help-the-Halloween" party?
{58071}{58123}No, not "Help-the-Halloween" party.
{58125}{58190}You don't ask for help in America. You demand it.
{58192}{58251}Trick or treat. You don't ask. You threaten.
{58253}{58306}- You can't do that on our street.|- Why not?
{58308}{58404}Because you can't threaten|drug addicts and transvestites, that's why.
{58417}{58465}What are transvestites?
{58475}{58533}A man who dresses up as a woman.
{58537}{58624}- For Halloween?|- No, all the time.
{58626}{58657}Come on.
{58686}{58786}- Why?|- It's just what they do here, okay?
{58832}{58930}We were allowed to go trick-or-treating|in our stupid building.
{59002}{59079}Trick or treat!
{59114}{59236}- Dad, get out of here!|- Trick or treat!
{59250}{59308}Come on, let's try another door.
{59531}{59588}Answer the fucking door.
{59668}{59743}- Why won't they answer?|- Maybe they're afraid.
{59916}{59961}We're nice kids, so let us in.
{59963}{60019}- How many doors is that?|- Four.
{60070}{60114}Why am I so anxious?
{60193}{60242}It's the stairs, Johnny.
{60388}{60470}- It says "keep away."|- I don't care. Come on, Christy.
{60531}{60571}Trick or treat!
{60843}{60885}Trick or treat.
{61033}{61068}Who's there?
{61111}{61158}- Someone's in there.|- Oh, my God!
{61367}{61423}No drugs here! Other door.
{61473}{61522}Knock again. I dare you.
{61628}{61680}- Trick or treat!|- Who--
{61805}{61834}Go away!
{61928}{61956}What?
{61982}{62011}Hello.
{62264}{62344}- Are you the kids from upstairs?|- Yeah.
{62465}{62515}- Is this Halloween?|- Yeah.
{62600}{62657}- Where are you from?|- Ireland.
{62669}{62744}You came all the way to America to trick-or-treat?
{62746}{62774}Yeah.
{62872}{62903}Come in.
{62993}{63061}- Are there only two of you?|- Two girls.
{64417}{64471}Are they all right in there?
{64683}{64723}They'll be fine.
{65003}{65066}- What's your name?|- Mateo.
{65066}{65125}- What's yours?|- Ariel. Hello.
{65138}{65187}- My name's Christy.|- Hi, Christy.
{65189}{65261}- Is that our building?|- Yes, it is.
{65332}{65388}Looks like a haunted house.
{65419}{65501}It is haunted. But it's not scary.
{65531}{65618}- It's a magic house.|- Frankie believed in magic.
{65649}{65734}- Who's that?|- Frankie. Our brother. He died.
{65772}{65841}He fell down the stairs when he was two.
{65878}{65926}We thought he was okay.
{65940}{66005}But there was something in his brain.
{66021}{66059}A brain tumour.
{66072}{66143}And for three years it got bigger and bigger.
{66145}{66186}It was malignant.
{66355}{66393}Are you crying?
{66537}{66567}Are you?
{66660}{66716}It's okay. He's in Heaven now.
{66764}{66806}Is that your hand?
{66869}{66937}- Yes.|- Is that blood?
{67105}{67145}Spaghetti sauce.
{67179}{67212}Come here.
{67278}{67339}I better treat you or you'll trick me, am I right?
{67341}{67411}- Yeah.|- Okay, let's find something.
{67474}{67548}Let's see. So, what's in the fridge?
{67636}{67673}Nothing.
{67840}{67873}How about this?
{67918}{68004}- How much is in it?|- A lot. Mateo's fortune.
{68006}{68061}- It's too much.|- No, it's not.
{68069}{68141}When luck comes knocking on your door,|you can't turn it away.
{68143}{68213}- Happy Halloween.|- Okay, happy Halloween. Bye.
{68239}{68276}Hi, Dad!
{68354}{68424}We're going to show Mam what we got, okay?
{68795}{68838}Happy Halloween.
{68852}{68900}Happy Halloween, Mateo.
{69026}{69105}He was really nice,|and he gave us lots of money.
{69114}{69178}How much does it add up to, Christy?
{69192}{69284}Two hundred and forty pennies,|twelve nickels, and two dimes.
{69286}{69366}- How much is that all together?|- $3.20.
{69481}{69561}- And he had nothing in his fridge?|- Just medicine.
{69577}{69628}We should invite him over.
{69647}{69677}No way.
{69690}{69747}He gives me the heebie-jeebies.
{70001}{70079}- What is it?|- It's called colcannon.
{70097}{70160}It's potatoes mixed with curly kale.
{70216}{70267}Right. Plates, please.
{70357}{70390}Thank you.
{70725}{70790}Wow! That means you're gonna be rich.
{70934}{70997}Halloween is called the Day of Ancestors.
{70999}{71072}When the dead come back, you hear their voices.
{71077}{71122}How do you hear them?
{71147}{71213}You hear their voices through the men dancing.
{71219}{71260}What do they say?
{71433}{71470}They complain.
{71533}{71593}"You don't pay attention to me.
{71632}{71670}"You don't feed me.
{71706}{71742}"I'm hungry."
{71780}{71824}Are they ever happy?
{71849}{71913}When they're happy, you never hear from them.
{72449}{72509}You're magic. You're winning everything.
{72587}{72650}That means you're gonna get married.
{72941}{72972}Christy!
{73101}{73136}Who's that?
{73689}{73725}You see that?
{73843}{73935}Do you not think I'm bad,|or are you just saying I'm good 'cause--
{73956}{73987}You are.
{74074}{74152}- Am I doing the wings nice?|- You're doing great.
{74154}{74206}- Really?|- Yes.
{74213}{74257}I thought I was bad.
{74313}{74356}You're doing great.
{74398}{74482}- Is that you in the pictures?|- Yeah.
{74554}{74596}So you were rich?
{74689}{74754}Is that why the angel has blue blood?
{74886}{74992}You know, in the Irish language,|the word for "black man" is fear gorm.
{75024}{75081}But that really means "blue man."
{75118}{75187}The word for "black man" is fear dub.
{75198}{75248}And that means "the Devil."
{75283}{75338}You have us figured out?
{75827}{75899}They can't wipe us out, they can't lick us.
{75909}{76004}We'll go on forever, Pa, 'cause we're the people.
{76062}{76121}"I said in mine heart, go to now...
{76138}{76242}"...prove thee with mirth,|therefore enjoy pleasure." Awesome.
{76245}{76326}Johnny, come to bed. It's late, come on.
{76367}{76416}Put the script down now.
{76693}{76805}- You're happy.|- I am. It's something Mateo said.
{76849}{76889}What's he say?
{76911}{76980}He said everything's gonna be all right.
{77027}{77092}And the baby will bring its own luck.
{77163}{77223}The baby will bring its own luck.
{77400}{77459}That's it there. You see?
{77474}{77517}I could be wrong...
{77537}{77624}...but I haven't felt the baby move|for a couple of weeks.
{77971}{78007}It's serious.
{78133}{78191}This baby will not go full term.
{78226}{78322}And if it did, it would be|extremely dangerous to your health.
{78386}{78485}If you decide to go ahead with this,|you'll have to be a very brave woman.
{78512}{78611}But I thought the doctor said|you couldn't have any more babies.
{78626}{78697}Sometimes, Ariel, doctors are wrong.
{78750}{78833}There. It just kicked.
{78857}{78891}Oh, my God!
{78948}{78988}Johnny, feel it.
{79139}{79204}I remember the first time you kicked, Christy.
{79224}{79285}It was in one of your dad's plays.
{79329}{79391}Every time he spoke, you kicked.
{79419}{79460}Like you were applauding him.
{79462}{79567}- Did I ever kick?|- You kicked like a mule, night and day.
{79673}{79715}There it is again.
{79762}{79811}Johnny, did you feel it?
{80039}{80085}I can't feel anything.
{80377}{80423}Do you want me to lie?
{80431}{80503}You're the only actor in the world|who can't lie, Johnny.
{80505}{80585}- Not even for the sake of your kids?|- What does that mean?
{80588}{80641}If you can't touch somebody you created...
{80643}{80713}...how can you create somebody|that'll touch anybody?
{80716}{80781}- What are you going on about?|- Acting, Johnny.
{80787}{80853}And bringing something to life.|It's the same thing.
{80855}{80951}That's why you can't get a job acting,|because you can't feel anything.
{81011}{81068}This baby's not Frankie, Sarah.
{81251}{81349}Look at me. Why don't you look at me?
{81473}{81521}You've gotten over him.
{81664}{81752}I had to get over him, Johnny,|for the sake of the kids.
{81766}{81849}So you're gonna put your life on the line|for the sake of the kids?
{81851}{81911}- And that's protecting them?|- Yes.
{81918}{81980}- That's a total contradiction.|- How?
{81988}{82044}You know what the doctor said.
{82088}{82142}I don't care what they said.
{82177}{82248}What do they know about us? And my baby?
{82311}{82358}I gotta fucking get out of here.
{82360}{82409}Where are you going?
{82411}{82450}- This is real.|- No!
{82452}{82522}This is real. It's not a fucking play!
{82524}{82582}What are you talking about? Where are you going?
{82584}{82621}- Let me get out.|- No.
{82626}{82672}You'll upset the kids!
{82749}{82799}I'll be back in a minute.
{82823}{82933}Johnny, come back. Johnny, where are you going?
{82943}{83002}Johnny, you're scaring me. Come back.
{83013}{83080}Just come back. Johnny, please.
{83683}{83768}All right? Everything all right?
{84245}{84316}The baby will bring its own luck, will it?
{84345}{84442}I'll tell you the luck the baby will bring.|The baby could infect her...
{84446}{84510}...and two giris will be left without their ma.
{84527}{84575}So keep your trap shut.
{84614}{84656}You don't believe.
{84790}{84821}In what?
{84924}{84951}God?
{85006}{85062}You know, I asked him a favour.
{85073}{85139}I asked him to take me instead of him.
{85169}{85221}And he took the both of us.
{85261}{85321}And look what he put in my place.
{85476}{85554}I'm a fucking ghost. I don't exist.
{85583}{85676}I can't think. I can't laugh. I can't cry.
{85697}{85742}I can't fucking feel!
{85894}{85937}Do you wanna be me?
{85952}{86035}- Do you wanna be in my place?|- I wish.
{86191}{86241}Are you in love with her?
{86362}{86442}- Are you in love with her?|- No.
{86543}{86588}I'm in love with you.
{86727}{86797}And I'm in love with your beautiful woman.
{86806}{86863}And I'm in love with your kids.
{86888}{86960}And I'm even in love with your unborn child.
{87098}{87162}I'm even in love with your anger!
{87212}{87277}I'm in love with anything that lives!
{87508}{87544}You're dying.
{87807}{87840}I'm sorry.
{89560}{89598}That's Frankie.
{91634}{91674}I'm just scared.
{91737}{91843}It's gone. I can't make-believe anymore.
{91889}{91963}Sometimes, I think our entire lives|are make-believe.
{92008}{92053}This is make-believe.
{92096}{92157}The air I breathe is make-believe.
{92195}{92290}Just make believe you're happy, Johnny.|Please, for the kids.
{92368}{92433}"Now is the winter of our discontent
{92441}{92527}"Made glorious summer by this sun of York
{92545}{92631}"And all the clouds that there are around
{92648}{92747}"Dance to the lascivious pleasings of a lute
{92749}{92828}"Now is the winter of our discontent
{92840}{92936}"Made glorious summer by this sun of York"
{92996}{93021}So I'm a little high...
{93023}{93106}Sometimes, it seemed like everyone|in New York was an actor.
{93126}{93161}Even the stockbrokers.
{93163}{93212}You might not think it to look at me...
{93214}{93278}...and I know I'm white and everything,|but I can rap.
{93280}{93361}Help, somebody! Somebody call an ambulance!
{93405}{93514}Come on, man. Somebody, help!
{93553}{93597}He's fallen down the stairs!
{93599}{93659}I think someone's fallen down the stairs.
{93679}{93734}I think it's Mateo. Get your coat.
{94008}{94072}It's Mateo. Will I get the lemon drops?
{94074}{94129}- Yeah, and a pillow.|- Okay.
{94131}{94195}Mateo! Did anyone call for help?
{94197}{94230}He just fainted.
{94251}{94299}Keep the dog away, man, keep him away.
{94301}{94375}- Go downstairs.|- Stevie doesn't let me. He'll lock me out.
{94377}{94473}That's because you're a junkie, Papo.|Go and get an ambulance.
{94476}{94513}Don't do that.
{94535}{94611}- I did this to my brother.|- No. It's different.
{94646}{94687}Come on, come on.
{94785}{94821}Are you okay?
{95165}{95247}- Are you okay?|- Can't seem to catch my breath.
{95249}{95313}- Just relax.|- Here.
{95354}{95437}- What are they?|- They're lemon drops. They're magic.
{95448}{95522}If you suck on some, they'll make you better.
{95551}{95612}- Is that right, Christy?|- Yeah.
{95649}{95711}My mom takes them to help the baby.
{95789}{95849}I think you saved my life, Ariel.
{96133}{96193}All right, that's it.|Get out of the fucking cab!
{96267}{96345}What are you talking about?|I was right in the middle of a flow.
{96347}{96415}Come on, what the hell|is the matter with you, you freak?
{96417}{96462}Where's the Bill of Rights?
{96488}{96580}- Get the fuck off me, you piece of shit.|- Take your fucking handbag!
{96623}{96657}Night, E.T.
{96666}{96696}Are you awake, Ariel?
{96698}{96754}- Yeah. Are you, Christy?|- Yeah.
{96787}{96860}- What's wrong with Mateo?|- Some disease.
{96863}{96911}- Will you get it?|- What?
{96945}{96985}Mateo's disease.
{97062}{97131}- Why?|- Because you kissed him.
{97212}{97238}No.
{97245}{97322}- Night, Christy.|- Night.
{98520}{98555}There's Dad.
{98852}{98903}Get him, Frankie, get him.
{100056}{100088}You okay?
{100197}{100247}I was just out of breath.
{100518}{100564}What was Frankie like?
{100624}{100657}A warrior.
{100867}{100911}What does that mean?
{100973}{101045}A warrior who's not afraid|to go to the other side.
{101054}{101102}The other side of what?
{101181}{101209}This.
{101253}{101284}Hi, Dad.
{101383}{101459}Ladies and gentlemen, we are not alone.
{101484}{101559}Here on this little ball we call the Earth...
{101567}{101628}...we have friends among us.
{101826}{101886}Don't be scared. He's not too well now.
{101888}{101943}Did he not take the lemon drops?
{101945}{102015}I don't think they agree with him anymore.
{102555}{102601}Why do you have sores?
{102851}{102961}If I tell you a secret, will you tell nobody else?
{102969}{103004}No, I won't.
{103110}{103205}I'm an alien. Like E.T.
{103352}{103401}From a different planet.
{103442}{103511}My skin is too sensitive for this Earth.
{103533}{103559}Right?
{103596}{103648}The air is too hot for me.
{103706}{103761}Are you going home like E.T.?
{103831}{103881}I suppose I'm going home.
{103906}{103949}When are you going?
{104248}{104276}Soon.
{104313}{104365}Will you say goodbye to me?
{104433}{104482}- I will.|- Promise?
{104569}{104621}Yes, I promise.
{104676}{104720}Mom's having a baby.
{104769}{104832}What do you think we should call it?
{104874}{104934}We're going to call it after you.
{105248}{105292}I think he's asleep.
{105375}{105429}My mom had to go into hospital...
{105431}{105530}...so I thought about using my third wish.|But I had to be careful.
{105546}{105621}If the baby came too soon, the baby might die.
{105628}{105706}And if the baby came too late,|my mom might die.
{105726}{105796}You have to be careful what you wish for.
{105826}{105906}Come on, kids, time to go.|See you later, all right?
{105908}{105939}- Bye, Mom.|- Bye.
{105941}{105991}- Take it easy, love.|- See you tomorrow.
{105993}{106062}- Bye.|- Love you.
{106143}{106192}Excuse me, Mr. Sullivan?
{106208}{106258}We'll need that check by Friday.
{106263}{106320}- For how much?|- $5,000.
{106337}{106403}All right, okay. That's great. Thanks.
{106489}{106592}You know the situation. You know I'm in trouble.
{106633}{106677}- Come on.|- "Shut up.
{106698}{106774}"Look into my eyes. What are they telling you?
{106799}{106847}"They're telling you no.
{106894}{106984}"You either do the job|or you get out of town. Understand?"
{107027}{107108}- I understand.|- That was good, Dad.
{107159}{107209}Yeah, it wasn't so bad from you.
{107233}{107275}You're gonna get it, Dad.
{107319}{107367}- Do you think so?|- Yeah.
{107426}{107478}Will we sell the camcorder?
{107500}{107526}No.
{107594}{107692}Don't be worrying, girl.|Everything's gonna be okay.
{107845}{107927}Hey, Irish. Irish!
{108024}{108111}Hey, Johnny. Haven't seen you for seven days.
{108114}{108184}- That means you owe me $7.|- Jesus, not again.
{108186}{108253}A dollar a day keeps Frank away.|Hey, I'm joking.
{108255}{108284}I've no money.
{108289}{108351}No, no. I got something for you.
{108395}{108429}Here, here.
{108444}{108507}- What are they?|- They're food stamps.
{108532}{108611}- I'm all right, thanks.|- Come on, you helped me out.
{108613}{108697}I'm just trying to help you out for once.|Come on, take them.
{108718}{108780}You can't take something from me?|Take the stamps.
{108782}{108832}Come on, take the stamps.
{108914}{108966}- Thanks.|- No problem, Irish.
{109197}{109251}Come on then. Tuck you in.
{109261}{109341}Dad? Who's gonna iron our school uniforms?
{109349}{109389}Daddo the baddo.
{109439}{109469}- Dad?|- What?
{109471}{109567}- I need money for school.|- I have that sorted. It's all right.
{109576}{109611}- Okay.|- Okay?
{109614}{109662}- Night, Dad.|- Good night.
{109695}{109780}Dad. You forgot to say Christy's prayer.
{109823}{109885}- I don't know it.|- I'll say it.
{109932}{109989}- All right.|- Kneel.
{110038}{110084}- What?|- Will you kneel?
{110126}{110195}No. I'm not kneeling, no.
{110241}{110326}- Mom always kneels.|- But dads are different.
{110447}{110525}- I want Mom.|- Christy, do the prayer, would you?
{110551}{110660}No monsters, no ghosts.|No nightmares, no witches.
{110679}{110755}No people coming into the kitchen,|smashing the dishes.
{110788}{110879}No devils coming out of the mirror,|no dolls coming alive.
{110913}{110989}Mateo going home, Frankie in Heaven.
{111002}{111073}The baby not coming too early or too late.
{111116}{111219}Mom, Dad, Christy, and Ariel,|all together in one happy family...
{111226}{111287}...and all well with the world. Amen.
{111340}{111383}You're great girls.
{111394}{111442}I'll see you in the morning.
{111444}{111493}- Night, Dad.|- Night, Dad.
{111603}{111713}- How much does it cost in the hospital?|- Thousands and thousands.
{111726}{111755}Good night.
{111789}{111833}"To be, or not to be..."
{111839}{111890}Blah, blah, fucking blah.
{111929}{111982}"Whether it be nobler in the mind"...
{111984}{112049}...to stick my head in the fucking oven|and end it all?
{112051}{112086}Where's Dad?
{112248}{112285}I want my dad.
{112325}{112386}- I am your dad.|- You're not my dad.
{112403}{112446}I want my real dad.
{112454}{112514}- Come here.|- Stay away from me.
{112533}{112601}- Come here to me.|- Where's Mom?
{112603}{112691}- What did you do with Mom?|- I'll get Mom. Come here, baby.
{112693}{112751}No! Mom!
{113083}{113116}Come here to me.
{113209}{113269}Look at me, look at me.
{113317}{113392}- Am I your dad?|- No.
{113427}{113482}Here, look. Look at me.
{113560}{113596}Am I your dad?
{113673}{113702}Maybe.
{113803}{113870}So spring came. And with it, the baby.
{113885}{113926}It had come too soon.
{114213}{114263}Can you get Karen for me?
{114317}{114395}Please don't let my baby come.|I don't want my baby to come.
{114397}{114481}No, it's too early. It's too early!
{114643}{114675}Coming through, stat.
{114677}{114710}I need a morphine drip.
{114757}{114797}Nurse, morphine.
{114807}{114867}Johnny, why is my baby not crying?
{114869}{114943}- Just go with the baby, go with the baby.|- I'm going.
{115435}{115492}We've stabilized her for now...
{115499}{115591}...but she will need a blood transfusion|in the next couple of hours.
{115861}{115894}All right?
{115937}{116047}Everything's gonna be okay.|The baby needs a blood transfusion.
{116092}{116189}We have to sign this consent form.|The pair of us.
{116232}{116268}Is that okay?
{116457}{116549}All the blood is bad.|Mateo said all the blood is bad.
{116569}{116632}You're not giving my baby bad blood.
{116692}{116744}You gave my baby bad blood.
{116777}{116869}And that's why he died.|That's why he fell down the stairs.
{116929}{116983}This is the new baby, Sarah.
{117123}{117207}He tried to climb the gate. And he fell.
{117255}{117301}Why did you put it up?
{117398}{117440}- Where is he?|- Who?
{117443}{117474}Frankie.
{117529}{117584}Frankie's not with us, Sarah.
{117915}{117978}You should have taken the gate down.
{118017}{118111}It's your fault.|You should have taken the gate down!
{118127}{118177}- You're hiding him.|- No, I'm not.
{118197}{118282}- I want to get Frankie. I want my baby!|- Calm down, all right?
{118303}{118401}- Where is he? I want Frankie.|- Easy. Easy, now. Doctor!
{118411}{118474}It's your fault he fell down the stairs.
{118476}{118529}Could you ring your bell there? Doctor!
{118531}{118600}Why didn't you take the gate down?
{118602}{118646}- It's all right.|- No, please.
{118648}{118711}Please, I'm begging you, please. Johnny, please.
{118713}{118793}No, no, please. I want to see my baby.
{118803}{118866}- Please don't take my new baby.|- I'm not taking her.
{118868}{118945}- Save my baby, Johnny, please.|- I promise.
{119133}{119163}I will.
{119246}{119315}If the baby dies, just don't wake me up.
{119478}{119554}- There's only one other solution.|- What's that?
{119576}{119635}- Are you O-negative?|- I am.
{119689}{119734}Christy's O-negative.
{119799}{119871}- What if I have it?|- Have what?
{119923}{119963}Mateo's disease.
{120036}{120091}That's not possible, Christy.
{120116}{120161}How do you know, Dad?
{120172}{120224}God won't let that happen to you.
{120250}{120300}You don't believe in God.
{120350}{120424}- I'm scared.|- Don't be scared.
{120437}{120478}Everyone's dying.
{120661}{120744}- Will she survive it?|- She can't survive without it.
{120822}{120898}That's what the doctors said|before they opened Frankie.
{120921}{121018}- What do we do?|- I'll give her the blood.
{121057}{121100}Is that a decision?
{121140}{121190}Christy will give her the blood.
{121395}{121446}Are you okay, little girl?
{121516}{121564}Don't "little girl" me.
{121581}{121661}I've been carrying this family|on my back for over a year.
{121675}{121724}Ever since Frankie died.
{121762}{121810}He was my brother, too.
{121838}{121932}It's not my fault that he's dead.|It's not my fault that I'm still alive.
{121934}{121965}Christy.
{122024}{122088}Mom was always crying|because he was her son.
{122110}{122230}But he was my brother, too.|I cried, too, when no one was looking.
{122277}{122355}- And I talked to him every night.|- She did, Dad.
{122466}{122570}- I talked to him every night until...|- Until when?
{122678}{122748}Until I realized I was talking to myself.
{122933}{122976}Listen, I'll take her home, okay?
{122978}{123039}- All right. Thanks very much.|- No problem.
{123086}{123129}Your check bounced.
{123313}{123416}I sat there with my dad, and all|the noises of New York disappeared.
{123481}{123551}All I could hear|was the blood thumping in my ear.
{123588}{123640}But for some reason, I felt happy.
{123686}{123794}I wondered if Frankie|had felt like this: special.
{123841}{123924}Everybody looking at you|like they were looking in a mirror.
{123935}{124010}And smiling. Except in their eyes.
{124124}{124181}Did Frankie know he was going to die?
{124207}{124272}Is that why he kept nodding and smiling at us?
{124917}{124969}When he died, I cursed God.
{125003}{125068}I told him,|"You're not gonna see these snotty tears...
{125070}{125133}"...running down my cheeks ever again."
{125187}{125231}So now, I can't cry.
{125383}{125450}I thought I'd come in here...
{125493}{125572}...and you'd wake up, you'd hold my hand.
{125629}{125709}I'd cry, and the kid would be all right.
{125741}{125791}Everything would be okay.
{125976}{126026}We need a miracle, Mateo.
{126088}{126139}Hey, Irish, whoa.
{126270}{126314}You can't say hello?
{126333}{126393}What? What's up?
{126425}{126511}- I'm sorry, man.|- A bad day?
{126531}{126612}- You could say that.|- Yeah, the whole world had a bad day.
{126679}{126750}Joe, come on, give me a few bucks.
{126797}{126862}- Come on.|- I don't have any money to give you.
{126886}{126969}I'm sorry. I'm stupid.|I shouldn't be bothering you.
{126998}{127066}Come on, lighten up, Joe. It's gonna get better.
{127111}{127214}Come on, Irish. Fighting Irish.|I'm coming to get you.
{127259}{127305}Just give me some money.
{127307}{127370}I'm not doing this for me. It's for Angela.
{127377}{127443}Come on, put your hand in your pocket.
{127451}{127527}- Take it easy.|- Your other pocket.
{127567}{127653}Your other pocket. Faster, Irish.|Let me see it.
{127680}{127714}Get it out.
{127731}{127787}- I don't know what it is.|- Take it out.
{127789}{127871}I'm taking it out. Okay, there you go.
{128071}{128108}I just needed money.
{128131}{128164}I'm sorry, okay?
{128198}{128242}Okay, that's enough.
{128410}{128513}Stop it. I'm sorry. Joe, I'm sorry.
{128673}{128774}- Hey, Joe. We're still friends?|- Go to hell.
{128864}{128951}We were waiting for the baby|to show some sign of life.
{128978}{129039}She just lay there and lay there.
{132245}{132332}The hospital bill arrived. It came to:
{132339}{132440}$30,420.20.
{132450}{132517}Look, just get me in the door for the audition.
{132529}{132571}I'll give them whatever they want.
{132573}{132622}Sir. Your bill is ready.
{132646}{132679}All right.
{132792}{132845}- Bill's been paid.|- What do you mean?
{132898}{132971}A Mateo Kuamey paid it.
{133031}{133074}There's no balance.
{133167}{133263}{y:i}See, see my playmate|{y:i}Come back
{133265}{133324}Finally, my dad got a part in a play.
{133329}{133385}And he came to tell us the good news.
{133387}{133431}{y:i}Since 1982
{133433}{133472}Got some good news, girls.
{133474}{133549}Sarah Mateo Sullivan is coming home|from the hospital.
{133622}{133656}Cool, yeah!
{133758}{133819}- Look who it is.|- How are you doing there?
{133823}{133864}- You want a look?|- Yeah.
{133877}{133932}- Mom, can I?|- Yeah, grand.
{134102}{134141}Okay, see you later.
{134167}{134207}Big yawn.
{134735}{134771}What's wrong?
{134794}{134849}- He never said goodbye.|- What?
{134864}{134910}He never said goodbye.
{136247}{136289}The baby's asleep.
{136403}{136434}Christy.
{136590}{136630}Come here to me.
{136745}{136812}Look up there and tell me what you see.
{136835}{136861}A full moon.
{136863}{136913}And what else do you see?
{136954}{136983}Stars.
{136994}{137040}Can you not see Mateo?
{137096}{137161}He's going past the moon on his bike.
{137182}{137247}I think he's waving goodbye to Ariel.
{137261}{137302}- Will we tell her?|- Yeah.
{137589}{137631}Look up there.
{137633}{137695}That's Mateo riding past the moon on his bike.
{137697}{137737}- Where?|- There, look.
{137739}{137806}- Can you not see him waving to you?|- No.
{137834}{137938}- He's right there.|- He's there, flying past the moon.
{137976}{138019}- Can you see him?|- No.
{138021}{138096}Can you not see him waving to you?|He's waving goodbye.
{138098}{138144}Just like he promised.
{138152}{138201}Oh, yeah. Bye, Mateo.
{138203}{138285}- Bye, Mateo.|- Bye, Mateo.
{138302}{138373}Bye, Mateo. Look after Frankie.
{138406}{138468}- Look after Frankie.|- Look after...
{138605}{138667}And then I asked for my third wish.
{138724}{138778}Say goodbye to Frankie, Dad.
{138828}{138856}What?
{138892}{138940}Say goodbye to Frankie.
{139100}{139196}- Bye, Frankie.|- He can't hear you, Dad.
{139409}{139450}Goodbye, Frankie.
{139867}{139907}Get out of here.
{140186}{140218}Dad wants you.
{140911}{141005}It was as hard for Frankie to smile,|when the tumour was malignant...
{141040}{141101}...as it was for my dad to cry after.
{141121}{141171}But they both managed it.
{141244}{141304}I'm going to switch this off now.
{141332}{141400}It's not the way I want to see Frankie anymore.
{141732}{141798}Do you still have a picture of me in your head?
{141830}{141906}Well, that's like the picture|I want to have of Frankie.
{141938}{142007}One that you can keep in your head forever.
{142069}{142130}So when you go back to reality...
{142172}{142215}...I'll ask Frankie...
{142255}{142351}...to please, please, let me go.
