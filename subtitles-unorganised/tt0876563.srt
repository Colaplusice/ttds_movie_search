Okay.

14
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,745
A goldfish...

15
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,712
That was weird.

16
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,318
Ow!

17
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,173
Sosuke, we're leaving!

18
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,071
Lisa, I caught a goldfish!

19
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,958
This wind feels strange...
Sosuke, I'm starting the car!

20
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,229
Did you find her?

21
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,935
What, captured by a human?

22
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,642
This is bad... very bad.

23
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,605
Are you dead?

24
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,153
You're alive!

25
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:09,459
Sosuke! I'm going to be late!

26
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,861
Lisa! I caught a goldfish.

27
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,495
A goldfish?

28
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,004
Down by the rocks.

29
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:46,235
I'm sorry, but you can't
use weed killer here.

30
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:54,676
Heavens no! This is pure sea water.
It keeps me humidified.

31
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,476
As long as
it's not weed killer.

32
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,280
Good day!

33
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,351
This is <i>very</i> bad.

34
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,827
What a creepy guy.

35
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:17,163
But don't <i>you</i> say that
about strangers, Sosuke.

36
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,396
Are you taking
that to school?

37
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,864
Won't the teacher complain?

38
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,581
She's cute!

39
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,253
They're using the dry dock.

40
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,384
Here, eat this
before we get there.

41
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,563
Maybe she's hungry.

42
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,727
Want some?

43
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,399
Hey, my cut is gone!

44
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,405
I'm going to call her Ponyo.

45
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,136
She's really special!
She can do magic.

46
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,477
She fixed my cut.

47
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,628
Want some ham?

48
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,569
Ponyo likes ham, Lisa!
That makes two of us.

49
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,628
Oh no...

50
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,967
Disgusting!

51
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,040
Hurry, Lisa!

52
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,548
Such filth! Intolerable!

53
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,058
Good morning!

54
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,462
Look, Ponyo.
There's our house.

55
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,952
I'll drop you here.
Okay.

56
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,118
Have fun.

57
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,820
See you.

58
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,665
Morning.
Sorry I'm late.

59
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,664
Could you get
Noriko's wheelchair?

60
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,911
Good morning, Sosuke.

61
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,816
I'm busy, Yoshie.
Talk to you later.

62
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,183
My!

63
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,790
Hello, Sosuke.

64
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,291
Can't talk now, Toki.

65
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,026
Maybe the teacher
will get mad.

66
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,035
I know!

67
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,779
Wait here.
I'll be back soon.

68
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,383
What if a cat comes?

69
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:06,726
Stay here, I'll be right back.

70
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,437
See you later.

71
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,571
It's all right.
She'll be just fine.

72
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,379
Okay, thanks. Bye bye.

73
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,410
Good morning, teacher.

74
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:27,811
Hello Sosuke.

75
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,443
How are you?

76
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,788
Sosuke!
Kumiko...

77
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:40,194
Like my dress?
Mommy got it for me.

78
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,424
Oh...

79
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,296
Let's play, Sosuke!

80
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,494
Not now. I'm busy.

81
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,161
How come?

82
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,798
I told you, I'm busy.
You're no fun.

83
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,034
Yeah!

84
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,031
Ponyo!

85
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,841
Sosuke!

86
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,067
Kumiko...

87
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,677
What's that?

88
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,870
You're not supposed to
bring stuff.

89
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:33,341
But these trees
aren't on school grounds.

90
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,747
Show me.

91
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,487
Oh, a goldfish.

92
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,918
It's not a goldfish.
It's Ponyo.

93
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,323
Ponyo? I want to see!

94
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,686
Promise not to tell?

95
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,058
I promise.

96
00:17:56,408 --> 00:18:00,276
It looks fat.
My goldfish is lots cuter.

97
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:27,035
It's Kumiko's fault.
She was mean to you.

98
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,972
I'll give you
some more water.

99
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,057
Ponyo!

100
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,075
You scared me.

101
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:15,078
Why, how odd.
That was Sosuke's voice.

102
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:20,120
But he's supposed
to be in school.

103
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,452
I must be hearing things.

104
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,822
Here I am, Yoshie.

105
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:30,164
I knew I heard your voice.

106
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,566
Do I have a secret?

107
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:34,603
Yes!

108
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,230
Bingo!

109
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,100
Okay, what color is my secret?

110
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,612
Red!
Red!

111
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,073
Good guess.

112
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,412
How'd you know?

113
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,816
Show us.

114
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,385
All right.

115
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,359
Oh, how pretty!

116
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,018
Very cute!

117
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,423
Her name is Ponyo.

118
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:02,000
She loves ham
and she can do magic.

119
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,493
I cut my thumb,
but she fixed it.

120
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:12,370
I wonder if she'd
fix our legs.

121
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:16,504
We could run around
just like you.

122
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:20,649
Well, I'd have
to ask Ponyo first.

123
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,981
Can I take a look?

124
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,383
Sure, Toki.

125
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,021
Heavens, it has a face!

126
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,662
You're so superstitious, Toki.

127
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,674
Fish like that are bad luck.

128
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,578
The tsunami! It's here!

129
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,712
The tsunami is here!

130
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,423
What's wrong, Toki?

131
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,992
Just look at my clothes!

132
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,297
Sosuke!

133
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,333
Sosuke!

134
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,149
Sosuke!

135
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,013
Come back here and apologize!

136
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:42,094
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

137
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,331
Sosuke.

138
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,430
Sosuke.

139
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,772
Ponyo!

140
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,581
Ponyo. Sosuke.

141
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,186
Ponyo... loves...

142
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,379
...Sosuke!

143
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,394
I love you too.

144
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,466
Ponyo loves Sosuke!

145
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,607
Ponyo!

146
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,706
Ponyo!

147
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,049
Ponyo!

148
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:11,980
Sosuke!

149
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,126
Ponyo!

150
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,849
Listen, Sosuke.
Maybe it was fate.

151
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,129
Ponyo was born in the sea.

152
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,288
She went back home,
that's all.

153
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:31,665
Anyway, let's hope
that creepy guy is gone.

154
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,661
One lick?

155
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,205
Hurry, it's melting!

156
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,975
Not bad!

157
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:49,449
Cheer up.
Koichi will be home tonight.

158
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:53,615
He'll be disappointed
if you're feeling down.

159
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,183
No more ocean today, okay?

160
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,006
Sosuke?

161
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,384
Time to come inside.

162
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,379
Do you think this bucket
will help Ponyo find us?

163
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,882
There's only one way
to find out.

164
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:19,636
Can you get that, Sosuke?
It must be Koichi.

165
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,208
Hello?

166
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,077
Yes, it's me.

167
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,219
I can't get back tonight.
I'll signal when I'm offshore.

168
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,719
Okay. Here's Lisa.

169
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:39,229
Koichi? Yes...
What?!

170
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,228
Can't you get out of it?

171
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:46,133
Fine... leave your wife
and son up on the cliff!

172
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,929
I give up!

173
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,806
Why bother?

174
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,036
There he is!

175
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,943
Turn off the lights, Lisa.

176
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:58,875
It's Sosuke! He's a genius.
Only five years old.

177
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,841
Your wife must be upset.

178
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:08,975
He says he's sorry.

179
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:09,877
J...

180
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:10,612

JERK!

00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:17,194
JERK!!

189
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:17,692
JERK!!!

JERK!!!!!

192
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,570
He says he loves you!

193
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,769
Lots and lots!

194
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:32,966
J...

JERK

JERK

201
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,318
Wow, that's cool!

202
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:50,755
G...

203
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:51,122

GOOD

206
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:52,223
GOOD L...

GOOD LU...

GOOD LUC...

209
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:53,723
GOOD LUCK

210
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,428
THANKS

211
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:01,294
LOVE AND KISSES

212
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:24,191
Don't cry, Lisa.
I won't cry.

213
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:29,498
I promised Ponyo
I'd take care of her.

214
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,608
I hope she isn't crying.

215
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:43,538
Okay, let's cheer up!

216
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:47,078
<i>"I'm happy as can be</i>... 

217
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,318
Ow!

218
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,944
Don't worry, Sosuke.

219
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:54,183
I'm sure Ponyo is fine too.

220
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:00,994
Now let's eat.
We'll eat Koichi's dinner too!

221
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,399
This is all my fault.

222
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:17,140
Bringing you along
to watch me was a mistake.

223
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:21,248
How often have I
warned you about humans?

224
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,749
Their very breath is polluted.

225
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,254
Come, you must eat.

226
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,891
Can't you hear me, Brunilde?

227
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,184
I want ham.

228
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:37,666
Ham?! What on earth
have you been doing?

229
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:39,599
Answer me, Brunilde!

230
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:43,136
My name's not Brunilde.
It's Ponyo.

231
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,135
Ponyo?

232
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,706
Ponyo loves Sosuke.

233
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,710
Human?

234
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,784
How could you love
such disgusting creatures?

235
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,351
They rob the sea of life.

236
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,989
I was human myself... once.

237
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,692
I finally escaped
that awful heritage.

238
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,698
Of all the nonsense!

239
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:39,363
Look at me!
Hands and feet!

240
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,133
Wanna see Sosuke!

241
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:50,207
No! His blood has
deranged your DNA!

242
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,240
Revert... revert...

243
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:01,083
Go back... go back!

244
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,990
It's not working.
I need more power.

245
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:22,530
Let me out!

246
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:28,909
Be still, you evil blood.
Revert, revert!

247
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:41,953
Just like her mother... so strong.

248
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:29,099
No! My elixir is
too strong for you!

249
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:31,508
Shoo! Go away!

250
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,801
My crab shields were weakening.

251
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,274
I nearly upset
Nature's balance.

252
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,947
When I think
of meeting HER again...!

253
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,751
This batch should be ready.

254
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,896
No leaks down here.

255
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,301
This door is loose.

256
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,113
Superb!

257
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:49,743
I feel the ocears power
in my very DNA.

258
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:54,716
When this well is full,
the Era of the Ocean will begin.

259
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,885
An explosion of life
to match the Cambrian Era!

260
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:01,157
This revolting era
of Man will be over.

261
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,837
Better fix this door.

262
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:33,023
Teeth!

263
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:43,533
I'm going back to Sosuke!

264
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,577
A waterspout?

265
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,950
Captain, look there!

266
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:24,556
Tsunami!
Turn her into the waves!

267
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:28,156
What's that?

268
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,729
Captain!
Radio's out, the radar too!

269
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:42,879
A little girl?
She must be Sosuke's age!

270
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,052
Bye bye.
See you tomorrow.

271
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,595
Thanks.
Take care.

272
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:03,792
Do you want
to wait here for Lisa?

273
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:07,097
It's okay, I'll take the shortcut.
Goodbye.

274
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:08,804
Goodbye.

275
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,864
Be careful out there.

276
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,717
Sorry, Sosuke.
The power's out.

277
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,948
The door wouldn't open, would it?
Was the school okay?

278
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:03,682
Go home, Lisa.
We'll be fine.

279
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,159
Are you sure?

280
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:13,362
We're spending the night anyway.
You should go while you can.

281
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,034
Wait for me, Sosuke.

282
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,945
Yoshie.

283
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,294
This is for you.

284
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:43,499
My, what is it?

285
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,261
One for you, Noriko.

286
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,869
Thank you.

287
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,469
Can't see a thing.

288
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,474
This is such foolishness!

289
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,579
I don't want
to spend the night.

290
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:03,717
Oh good, the power's on.
It's a goldfish!

291
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:08,516
Maybe Sosuke's magic
made the lights go on?

292
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:11,388
<i>Extremely powerful...</i>

293
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:14,053
<i>Ships should exercise</i>

294
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,228
This TV is useless.

295
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:22,370
Those idiots couldn't forecast
their way out of a paper bag.

296
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:24,497
You should go home, Sosuke.

297
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:30,140
Your goldfish will bring us luck.
We're not afraid now.

298
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,489
Here's yours, Toki.

299
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:47,395
It's all wrinkled.
What is it?

300
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:48,589
Like this.

301
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,136
I know!
It's a grasshopper.

302
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:59,107
That's your father's ship.

303
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:01,670
Still looks like
a grasshopper.

304
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:05,948
We're leaving, Sosuke.
Say goodbye to everyone.

305
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,313
Goodbye, everybody.

306
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:12,647
Goodbye.

307
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,724
Don't let the wind
blow you away!

308
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,455
Climb over.

309
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,000
The phones are out too.

310
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,456
The sea is puffed up!

311
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,827
Will the ships sink?

312
00:43:57,234 --> 00:44:01,898
They're safe out at sea.
I'm sure that's where Koichi is.

313
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,077
I see fish, Lisa.
Seat belt!

314
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:30,159
You've got to turn back!

315
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,894
People are going
to the shelters.

316
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:37,607
But there are people
at the senior center!

317
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:41,675
They'll be alright.
They're on the leeward side.

318
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,076
I've just got to get home.

319
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,783
You'd better go
around the mountain.

320
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,682
Here we go, Sosuke.

321
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:55,523
No! Stop!

322
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,627
Look out for that wave!

323
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:03,991
Here it comes!

324
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,600
Run for it, Lisa!

325
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:49,569
The fish are following us.
Seat belt, Sosuke!

326
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,952
Hold on tight!

327
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:58,910
That wave won't quit!

328
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:13,289
A little girl fell in.
She was riding a fish.

329
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:19,699
Where?

330
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,077
The sea keeps rising.

331
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,679
Where did you see her?

332
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,416
Running on top of a fish.

333
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:36,776
A fish!?

334
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:42,685
Come on, Sosuke.

335
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:02,073
Hang on, Sosuke!
We're almost home.

336
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:57,760
A little girl!

337
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:01,129
Here, you'd better
come with us.

338
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,596
Stay there, Sosuke.

339
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,091
Sosuke, do you know her?

340
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:53,750
Ponyo?

341
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:56,921
Yes, it's me!

342
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,955
It's you!

343
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:04,299
Ponyo's a little girl now, Lisa!

344
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:38,933
Now listen, children.

345
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:42,603
No matter how strange
everything seems...

346
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,838
...we have to stay calm.

347
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,506
Now be good.

348
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:53,682
Take off your rain coat, Sosuke.

349
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:56,510
Here Ponyo, you hold the light.

350
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:21,670
C'mon, Ponyo!

351
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,106
It smells just like you!

352
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:29,746
Ouch!

353
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:30,853
Ponyo!

354
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:39,353
Gotcha!
Let's get you dried off.

355
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:45,662
Such pretty red hair!

356
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,128
But your clothes are dry...

357
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:54,633
Ponyo was a fish.
Water doesn't make her wet.

358
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,647
All right!
Who wants a hot drink?

359
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:06,151
Help me with the light, Ponyo.

360
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:07,687
Coming!

361
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:10,283
Think we'll have water?

362
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:11,359
Sure!

363
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:12,789
Sure!

364
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:16,395
Water!

365
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,261
Water!

366
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:21,563
We have a tank outside.

367
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,433
What about the gas?

368
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:26,869
Presto!

369
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:27,904
All right!

370
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,134
All right!

371
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,270
It's propane.

372
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,680
Okay, take your seats.

373
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,714
Okay!

374
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:39,754
Over here, Ponyo.

375
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,120
Sit down, like this.

376
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,165
Put your stuff down.

377
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:56,031
You need your hands.

378
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,072
Wow!

379
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:07,206
What are you two doing?

380
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,248
Her feet are like hands.

381
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:31,263
There you go.

382
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,147
This is the best!

383
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,526
That hit the spot.

384
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:34,269
What shall we do now?

385
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:36,228
I want ham.

386
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:38,668
She's crazy about ham.

387
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:42,202
Then let's eat.

388
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:45,380
But first let's start
the generator.

389
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,947
We need electricity
to talk to Koichi.

390
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:53,547
Koichi is my father.

391
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:58,961
No, silly.
He's a ship captain.

392
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,563
What about your father, Ponyo?

393
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:04,923
Fujimoto!
He keeps me prisoner.

394
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:08,030
I ran away.

395
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:11,164
What about your mother?

396
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:14,600
I love my mother!

397
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:17,545
She's really scary.

398
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,076
Sounds like Lisa.

399
00:55:24,184 --> 00:55:26,049
Can you help me, Ponyo?

400
00:55:42,068 --> 00:55:44,798
Maybe the fuel's too old?

401
00:55:45,372 --> 00:55:46,566
Is it clogged?

402
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:47,866
Clogged.

403
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:50,305
It's clogged there.

404
00:56:05,292 --> 00:56:06,623
Success!

405
00:56:06,927 --> 00:56:08,758
All bright!

406
00:56:10,497 --> 00:56:12,362
Wow, Ponyo!

407
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:32,079
Antenna! Antenna!

408
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:35,211
Did all the ships sink, Lisa?

409
00:56:36,623 --> 00:56:38,853
I can't see a single light.

410
00:56:56,743 --> 00:56:58,472
So loud!

411
00:56:58,745 --> 00:56:59,712
What's wrong?

412
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:03,349
Even the radio
is out of whack.

413
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:18,860
We're going to have dinner.

414
00:57:19,366 --> 00:57:20,731
Ham!

415
00:57:29,509 --> 00:57:33,377
Ready? Careful, it's hot.

416
00:57:48,862 --> 00:57:50,227
It's not ready yet.

417
00:58:07,347 --> 00:58:08,939
Close your eyes!

418
00:58:09,983 --> 00:58:11,610
Not yet!

419
00:58:13,987 --> 00:58:15,887
No peeking, Ponyo.

420
00:58:19,592 --> 00:58:21,617
Okay, you can look now.

421
00:58:22,429 --> 00:58:24,624
And... presto!

422
00:58:30,971 --> 00:58:31,995
Ham!

423
00:58:32,138 --> 00:58:33,765
Good for you, Ponyo.

424
00:58:55,161 --> 00:58:57,186
Ponyo went to sleep.

425
00:59:24,557 --> 00:59:27,355
Look Sosuke.
The sea is calmer.

426
00:59:28,395 --> 00:59:29,862
Because Ponyo's asleep?

427
00:59:29,996 --> 00:59:31,827
Look over there!

428
00:59:39,606 --> 00:59:42,166
It's moving.
Someone's up there.

429
00:59:42,642 --> 00:59:44,439
People from
the senior center?

430
00:59:51,017 --> 00:59:52,143
It's gone.

431
00:59:52,285 --> 00:59:53,980
That's the peak road.

432
00:59:57,724 --> 00:59:59,715
Sosuke, stay there
with Ponyo.

433
01:00:11,071 --> 01:00:15,064
Maybe I could get through
on the mountain road.

434
01:00:17,977 --> 01:00:20,468
I'm going to the senior center.

435
01:00:20,613 --> 01:00:21,773
I'll go too.

436
01:00:23,016 --> 01:00:25,041
Stay here with Ponyo.

437
01:00:25,285 --> 01:00:28,618
I'm going too.
Let's take Ponyo with us.

438
01:00:29,355 --> 01:00:30,788
I'm going with you!

439
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:36,825
Sosuke, our house
is a lighthouse in the storm.

440
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:43,067
Someone has to stay here.

441
01:00:44,037 --> 01:00:48,804
Lots of things are happening
that I don't understand.

442
01:00:48,942 --> 01:00:53,436
But right now I'm worried about
the people at the senior center.

443
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:58,139
Just knowing you're
here will help me.

444
01:00:58,351 --> 01:01:01,320
Don't worry.
I promise to come back.

445
01:01:02,822 --> 01:01:03,811
Promise?

446
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:06,622
I promise.

447
01:01:06,759 --> 01:01:08,283
You promised!

448
01:01:09,229 --> 01:01:10,821
I love you, Sosuke.

449
01:02:05,552 --> 01:02:08,885
I see the lights of the town!

450
01:02:09,155 --> 01:02:10,144
Finally...

451
01:02:10,557 --> 01:02:12,320
Now we can navigate.

452
01:02:12,525 --> 01:02:14,959
I've never seen
that town before.

453
01:02:20,733 --> 01:02:23,531
Did the storm
blow us to America?

454
01:02:41,287 --> 01:02:44,620
That's not a mountain.
And that's no harbor...

455
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:46,288
Those are ships!

456
01:03:00,006 --> 01:03:04,306
It's a ship graveyard.
What's going on?

457
01:03:09,415 --> 01:03:10,746
We lost power!

458
01:03:10,883 --> 01:03:13,875
Heave to!
Drop the sea anchor!

459
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:15,180
Aye aye!

460
01:03:28,501 --> 01:03:30,264
Something is coming!

461
01:03:58,264 --> 01:04:00,027
A sea goddess!?

462
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:11,634
The engine!

463
01:04:11,778 --> 01:04:12,904
We're saved!

464
01:04:13,046 --> 01:04:16,072
The engine started again.
It was Her!

465
01:04:16,215 --> 01:04:19,776
Protect us from harm...

466
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,809
Come on, come on.

467
01:05:02,228 --> 01:05:07,165
A barrier spell!
Where did she learn this?

468
01:05:24,884 --> 01:05:27,648
Good heavens... she's human!

469
01:05:28,755 --> 01:05:31,690
Hey, watch out!
What are you doing?

470
01:05:39,732 --> 01:05:42,428
Stop! This is unsafe!

471
01:05:45,505 --> 01:05:46,870
Stop that at once!

472
01:05:54,647 --> 01:05:57,980
I'm simply trying
to save your sister.

473
01:06:03,322 --> 01:06:06,348
She's here.
She answered my call!

474
01:06:43,162 --> 01:06:46,723
Fujimoto...
You came, my beloved.

475
01:06:47,567 --> 01:06:49,467
Such a beautiful ocean.

476
01:06:58,411 --> 01:07:01,073
It's Ponyo!
She tasted human blood...

477
01:07:01,214 --> 01:07:04,342
...and plundered all of my elixir.

478
01:07:05,218 --> 01:07:08,949
Ponyo... what a lovely name.

479
01:07:14,594 --> 01:07:16,357
It's all my fault.

480
01:07:17,096 --> 01:07:21,465
She's totally beyond my control.
It's complete chaos.

481
01:07:21,601 --> 01:07:24,195
She doesn't understand
what she's done.

482
01:07:24,637 --> 01:07:29,973
Now she's human, and she's...

483
01:07:30,843 --> 01:07:34,370
If we don't stop her,
the planet is doomed!

484
01:07:43,289 --> 01:07:46,019
No! The satellites are falling.

485
01:07:46,158 --> 01:07:48,718
Earth's gravitational field...

486
01:07:50,062 --> 01:07:51,723
Be still...

487
01:07:58,938 --> 01:08:02,806
Sosuke... that is his name, yes?

488
01:08:06,245 --> 01:08:10,079
You love your sister,
don't you?

489
01:08:13,553 --> 01:08:17,284
Listen, dear... what if Ponyo
really became human?

490
01:08:18,157 --> 01:08:19,818
Use the old magic.

491
01:08:20,026 --> 01:08:24,793
If Sosuke's love is real,
she'll lose her powers forever.

492
01:08:25,064 --> 01:08:29,558
But if it's not,
she'll turn to sea foam!

493
01:08:29,969 --> 01:08:33,803
That's where we all
came from, dear.

494
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:36,773
But he's only five!

495
01:08:42,081 --> 01:08:45,778
Sleep well, little children.

496
01:08:58,798 --> 01:08:59,924
Sosuke!

497
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:02,628
Sosuke!

498
01:09:03,869 --> 01:09:05,496
Ow!

499
01:09:08,107 --> 01:09:09,768
Good morning, Ponyo.

500
01:09:10,142 --> 01:09:12,508
Morning, Sosuke.

501
01:09:18,751 --> 01:09:21,311
We almost got flooded.

502
01:09:44,744 --> 01:09:48,771
Where's Lisa?
She must be stuck someplace.

503
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,444
There's a boat!

504
01:09:58,658 --> 01:09:59,852
We can't fit.

505
01:09:59,992 --> 01:10:01,619
Can so.

506
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:18,502
Awesome!

507
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:23,471
The candle's bigger too.

508
01:10:23,616 --> 01:10:24,913
We can fit.

509
01:10:25,051 --> 01:10:26,279
This is cool.

510
01:10:26,485 --> 01:10:27,782
Cool!

511
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,080
Grab that end.

512
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:34,084
Ready?

513
01:10:34,393 --> 01:10:35,621
Ready!

514
01:10:48,741 --> 01:10:50,402
She's seaworthy!

515
01:10:52,712 --> 01:10:55,112
Awesome. No leaks!

516
01:10:55,247 --> 01:10:57,681
Now we fill the boiler.

517
01:10:58,384 --> 01:11:00,852
The water goes in here.

518
01:11:01,353 --> 01:11:03,947
It goes in the boiler.

519
01:11:40,192 --> 01:11:41,625
Everything's shipshape.

520
01:11:41,827 --> 01:11:43,351
Shipshape...

521
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:45,119
Shipshape?

522
01:11:45,264 --> 01:11:45,992
Shipshape!

523
01:11:46,265 --> 01:11:48,927
Shipshape! Shipshape!

524
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:14,554
Hot!

525
01:12:19,298 --> 01:12:21,027
It's hot.

526
01:12:24,003 --> 01:12:26,631
The candle's burning.
It's burning!

527
01:12:26,906 --> 01:12:30,307
Hot hot hot!

528
01:12:37,917 --> 01:12:39,782
It's hot.

529
01:12:50,696 --> 01:12:51,993
Awesome!

530
01:12:56,936 --> 01:12:58,733
This is great.

531
01:13:06,111 --> 01:13:08,204
This is so much fun.

532
01:13:12,551 --> 01:13:14,678
It's really hot.

533
01:13:15,421 --> 01:13:19,187
Keep a lookout in front.
I'll steer the boat.

534
01:13:19,725 --> 01:13:21,386
Okay, I'm the lookout.

535
01:13:48,454 --> 01:13:49,978
There's a road.

536
01:13:50,122 --> 01:13:52,113
That's the road Lisa took.

537
01:13:56,629 --> 01:14:00,065
You will.
She gave me her promise.

538
01:14:04,837 --> 01:14:08,068
Ancient fish...
from the Devonian age!

539
01:14:08,207 --> 01:14:10,300
There's Bothriolepis.

540
01:14:15,447 --> 01:14:16,505
That one is...

541
01:14:16,782 --> 01:14:17,749
Dipnorhynchus.

542
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:19,417
Dipnorhynchus!

543
01:14:19,618 --> 01:14:21,882
That one's really huge.

544
01:14:22,154 --> 01:14:23,849
That's Devonynchus.

545
01:14:24,056 --> 01:14:26,217
Devonynchus!

546
01:14:32,564 --> 01:14:34,828
Ahoy!

547
01:14:38,137 --> 01:14:39,104
A boat!

548
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:41,831
Ahoy!

549
01:14:43,142 --> 01:14:44,837
They're calling us.

550
01:14:46,045 --> 01:14:47,842
Ahoy!

551
01:14:49,715 --> 01:14:50,977
Ow!

552
01:14:58,157 --> 01:14:59,488
Pretty good, huh?

553
01:15:03,262 --> 01:15:04,854
Now, Ponyo.

554
01:15:11,136 --> 01:15:13,195
Hello.

555
01:15:16,275 --> 01:15:19,267
Why, you're Lisa's little boy.

556
01:15:19,578 --> 01:15:22,069
He's not little, he's Sosuke.

557
01:15:22,281 --> 01:15:23,805
This is Ponyo.

558
01:15:27,252 --> 01:15:28,685
A fish?

559
01:15:29,488 --> 01:15:31,388
Ponyo... that's a nice name.

560
01:15:33,726 --> 01:15:35,626
Have you seen Lisa?

561
01:15:35,828 --> 01:15:37,159
Lisa?

562
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:39,824
She's not with you?

563
01:15:39,965 --> 01:15:41,262
She's at the center.

564
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,765
The senior center...?

565
01:15:42,968 --> 01:15:44,401
This is my baby.

566
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,925
Oh my, what happened?

567
01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:40,219
Give me the cup, dear.

568
01:16:45,097 --> 01:16:46,291
Thank you.

569
01:16:46,765 --> 01:16:48,494
Let's try it.

570
01:16:54,673 --> 01:16:56,573
Lisa made it.

571
01:16:57,009 --> 01:16:58,306
It's for the baby.

572
01:16:59,078 --> 01:17:04,038
Oh, I'm sorry.
He can't handle soup yet.

573
01:17:04,316 --> 01:17:08,309
But this will help me
make milk for him.

574
01:17:10,556 --> 01:17:12,820
Lisa gave me her milk too.

575
01:17:13,425 --> 01:17:16,656
Ponyo, may I have this soup?

576
01:17:16,795 --> 01:17:18,660
Sure.

577
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:20,530
Thank you.

578
01:17:37,883 --> 01:17:41,341
People from the town.
It's like a festival.

579
01:17:41,787 --> 01:17:46,247
You there!
Do you need assistance?

580
01:17:46,725 --> 01:17:51,492
Thanks, we're okay right now!

581
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:54,590
Then please follow us.

582
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,735
We're going to
the hotel on the peak.

583
01:17:58,003 --> 01:18:00,904
Okay! Will do.

584
01:18:02,474 --> 01:18:03,907
The whole towrs here.

585
01:18:06,845 --> 01:18:10,303
Let's go, Ponyo.
Hold on a second.

586
01:18:16,021 --> 01:18:16,988
Milk!

587
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:19,389
Oh my...

588
01:18:20,425 --> 01:18:21,483
Milk!

589
01:18:21,627 --> 01:18:24,118
She ate up all the ham.

590
01:18:24,263 --> 01:18:27,164
This will help me
make good milk.

591
01:18:27,399 --> 01:18:31,529
Can you use another candle
for your boat, Sosuke?

592
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:35,003
Thanks.
Ponyo will make it bigger.

593
01:18:35,974 --> 01:18:37,032
Be careful!

594
01:18:37,176 --> 01:18:38,803
Thank you both!

595
01:18:44,783 --> 01:18:46,341
What is it, dear?

596
01:18:50,889 --> 01:18:52,413
Don't cry.

597
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:13,102
Ponyo!

598
01:19:25,891 --> 01:19:27,381
Sosuke!

599
01:19:29,361 --> 01:19:32,228
Where's Lisa?
Isn't she with you?

600
01:19:32,497 --> 01:19:35,694
I'm going to pick her up.

601
01:19:35,968 --> 01:19:39,335
So she survived that wave?

602
01:19:39,805 --> 01:19:42,433
Sosuke, take me with you!

603
01:19:42,841 --> 01:19:45,537
Later, Kumiko.
I'm busy now.

604
01:19:45,811 --> 01:19:49,212
Everyone from the center
evacuated to the park.

605
01:19:49,414 --> 01:19:51,609
Keep safe!
You can do it!

606
01:19:52,084 --> 01:19:55,747
We'll send a boat
for them later.

607
01:19:55,988 --> 01:19:58,218
Good luck, captain!

608
01:20:47,272 --> 01:20:50,139
Time for a new candle, Ponyo.

609
01:20:57,916 --> 01:21:00,885
Ow! It's still pretty hot.

610
01:21:05,991 --> 01:21:08,653
Bye bye.

611
01:21:09,461 --> 01:21:12,828
Can you make this candle bigger?

612
01:21:13,031 --> 01:21:14,498
All right.

613
01:21:20,038 --> 01:21:22,905
Are you sleepy, Ponyo?

614
01:21:30,082 --> 01:21:31,310
Ponyo!

615
01:21:47,265 --> 01:21:48,926
Ponyo! Ponyo!

616
01:22:46,858 --> 01:22:49,326
Good... it's shallow enough to walk.

617
01:23:15,821 --> 01:23:17,288
A road!

618
01:23:32,904 --> 01:23:34,303
Ponyo!

619
01:23:56,127 --> 01:23:58,152
Ponyo, wake up!

620
01:24:00,832 --> 01:24:02,595
Sosuke...

621
01:24:08,507 --> 01:24:09,997
Don't scare me.

622
01:24:10,208 --> 01:24:13,268
I thought you were
turning into a fish.

623
01:24:25,524 --> 01:24:26,513
Lisa's car!

624
01:24:26,925 --> 01:24:29,086
Ponyo, that's her car!

625
01:24:32,998 --> 01:24:34,795
Lisa!

626
01:24:38,169 --> 01:24:39,101
Lisa!

627
01:24:43,108 --> 01:24:44,837
Lisa!

628
01:24:47,012 --> 01:24:48,741
Lisa!

629
01:24:57,188 --> 01:24:59,349
Lisa!

630
01:25:02,027 --> 01:25:03,619
Lisa!

631
01:25:32,123 --> 01:25:34,421
Here's your boat.

632
01:25:34,593 --> 01:25:37,528
Your eyes are wet.

633
01:25:44,235 --> 01:25:46,203
Let's find Lisa.

634
01:26:33,485 --> 01:26:36,352
You forgot your wrap!
Who needs it?

635
01:26:36,488 --> 01:26:38,979
Look, it's a whale!

636
01:26:39,991 --> 01:26:45,486
My knees don't hurt anymore!
What were we so afraid of?

637
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:49,031
Is this the Other Side?
Who cares? It's wonderful.

638
01:26:51,403 --> 01:26:54,463
Attention, please!
Gather round.

639
01:26:54,773 --> 01:26:56,070
Coming!

640
01:26:56,207 --> 01:26:57,868
Shall we?

641
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:04,280
Meet you there!

642
01:27:07,452 --> 01:27:09,386
The winner!

643
01:27:11,456 --> 01:27:13,720
You're so fast, Kayo.

644
01:27:14,492 --> 01:27:16,187
Quiet, everyone!

645
01:27:17,062 --> 01:27:19,326
The moment
of truth is at hand.

646
01:27:19,564 --> 01:27:22,032
Sosuke and Ponyo
are almost here.

647
01:27:23,735 --> 01:27:27,933
Will love triumph?
I'm so excited!

648
01:27:29,374 --> 01:27:30,602
Quiet!

649
01:27:37,315 --> 01:27:41,718
Mr. Fujimoto, you're not
up to something, are you?

650
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,889
Nonsense, he's her father.

651
01:27:49,527 --> 01:27:51,222
Now excuse me!

652
01:28:01,973 --> 01:28:04,407
Where's Lisa gone to?

653
01:28:04,576 --> 01:28:09,309
She's been talking with
Ponyo's mother for ages.

654
01:28:20,058 --> 01:28:22,652
What are they talking about?

655
01:28:22,794 --> 01:28:25,456
Let's find out. Lisa!

656
01:28:25,597 --> 01:28:28,828
Lisa!

657
01:28:34,405 --> 01:28:41,368
We're all rooting
for Sosuke and Ponyo!

658
01:28:54,692 --> 01:28:55,886
Lisa!

659
01:28:56,027 --> 01:28:59,519
You must be worried.
Sosuke will be just fine.

660
01:28:59,664 --> 01:29:02,292
He's a strong little boy.

661
01:29:03,268 --> 01:29:06,863
Thanks, everyone.
He'll need your support.

662
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:17,548
Ponyo, it's a tunnel.

663
01:29:25,723 --> 01:29:28,556
"STOP"

664
01:29:36,434 --> 01:29:37,560
Ponyo?

665
01:29:44,075 --> 01:29:46,100
Don't let go of my hand.

666
01:30:24,082 --> 01:30:25,413
Ponyo!

667
01:30:44,569 --> 01:30:45,536
Ponyo!

668
01:30:53,912 --> 01:30:54,879
Ponyo!

669
01:31:16,834 --> 01:31:19,132
Please don't die!

670
01:31:19,570 --> 01:31:21,265
Ponyo!

671
01:31:22,073 --> 01:31:24,541
Wake up, Ponyo!

672
01:31:24,676 --> 01:31:27,270
Let her sleep.

673
01:31:28,346 --> 01:31:30,314
I've been waiting for you, Sosuke.

674
01:31:30,448 --> 01:31:33,781
Lisa and the old ladies
are waiting too.

675
01:31:34,752 --> 01:31:35,776
Lisa?!

676
01:31:35,987 --> 01:31:39,423
Won't you come with me?
You and Ponyo.

677
01:31:42,193 --> 01:31:44,923
Let's not wake her.

678
01:31:45,063 --> 01:31:47,224
Sosuke!

679
01:31:47,598 --> 01:31:50,499
Don't listen to him!

680
01:31:51,102 --> 01:31:54,367
He tricked everyone
into going with him.

681
01:31:54,505 --> 01:31:55,301
Toki!

682
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,374
But he couldn't fool me!

683
01:31:58,176 --> 01:32:03,705
There's no time, I tell you.
Don't you see what's happening?

684
01:32:03,848 --> 01:32:07,375
If the Moon comes
any closer, we're finished!

685
01:32:07,752 --> 01:32:10,778
Is that the best
you can do?

686
01:32:11,255 --> 01:32:13,655
Sosuke, come here!

687
01:32:13,858 --> 01:32:17,294
Listen to me, Sosuke.
You're the planet's last hope.

688
01:32:17,428 --> 01:32:19,362
Don't make me use force.

689
01:32:20,832 --> 01:32:21,992
Ponyo!

690
01:32:23,568 --> 01:32:26,196
Is this how you
treat your father?

691
01:32:33,044 --> 01:32:34,306
Ponyo!

692
01:32:34,445 --> 01:32:37,039
Run, Sosuke!

693
01:32:37,181 --> 01:32:39,411
You don't understand!

694
01:32:44,489 --> 01:32:46,150
You can make it!

695
01:32:48,259 --> 01:32:49,658
Jump!

696
01:33:28,966 --> 01:33:30,263
Now what?

697
01:34:25,189 --> 01:34:26,121
Lisa!

698
01:34:26,257 --> 01:34:27,451
Sosuke!

699
01:34:27,692 --> 01:34:28,852
Ponyo!

700
01:34:33,898 --> 01:34:37,425
Look over there.
Where are we?

701
01:34:47,812 --> 01:34:49,939
So, you are Sosuke.

702
01:34:50,148 --> 01:34:53,481
Hello. Are you
Ponyo's mother?

703
01:34:53,751 --> 01:34:54,683
Yes.

704
01:34:55,186 --> 01:34:59,680
I want to thank you for bringing
my daughter back to me.

705
01:35:00,324 --> 01:35:05,785
Ponyo wanted to be like you,
but she unleashed a terrible power.

706
01:35:06,864 --> 01:35:10,732
To become human, she must be loved...

707
01:35:14,305 --> 01:35:18,366
Do you know that Ponyo was a fish?

708
01:35:18,609 --> 01:35:19,576
Yes.

709
01:35:19,710 --> 01:35:23,669
Your blood made her human... almost.

710
01:35:23,814 --> 01:35:24,781
That's right!

711
01:35:24,916 --> 01:35:28,374
Ponyo licked
my cut and made it better.

712
01:35:28,519 --> 01:35:30,919
So that's why she changed!

713
01:35:32,023 --> 01:35:35,686
Can you accept her as she is?

714
01:35:36,027 --> 01:35:38,086
I'll always love Ponyo...

715
01:35:38,262 --> 01:35:40,787
...whether she's a fish, a human...

716
01:35:40,932 --> 01:35:43,332
...or in between.

717
01:35:56,681 --> 01:35:59,047
Come, Ponyo.

718
01:36:13,331 --> 01:36:18,132
Sosuke has promised
to accept you as you are.

719
01:36:20,972 --> 01:36:24,635
But first, you must
give up your powers.

720
01:36:25,176 --> 01:36:26,837
Can you do that?

721
01:36:37,054 --> 01:36:40,751
Kiss this bubble
when you return to land...

722
01:36:40,891 --> 01:36:45,260
...and Ponyo
will be a little girl.

723
01:36:48,065 --> 01:36:50,363
Way to go, Ponyo!

724
01:36:51,068 --> 01:36:53,730
Thank you, Ponyo's mother!

725
01:36:59,577 --> 01:37:03,172
Now the planet is safe again.

726
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:08,443
Splendid, Sosuke!

727
01:37:14,659 --> 01:37:16,354
Sosuke!

728
01:37:40,284 --> 01:37:42,115
I'm grateful, Lisa.

729
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:45,182
Thank you, Gran Mamare.

730
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:59,865
There you are!
Are you all right?

731
01:38:04,842 --> 01:38:06,810
Wait, I'll get the wheelchairs.

732
01:38:06,944 --> 01:38:09,105
Don't bother, we'll walk.

733
01:38:09,246 --> 01:38:11,680
It's all so exciting.

734
01:38:14,952 --> 01:38:16,681
I believe this is yours.

735
01:38:19,223 --> 01:38:20,190
Thanks.

736
01:38:20,758 --> 01:38:24,694
I hope you'll
forgive me... may I?

737
01:38:30,434 --> 01:38:32,493
Take good care of her.

738
01:38:40,911 --> 01:38:42,970
Koichi!

739
01:38:46,484 --> 01:38:49,851
It's Lisa!
And there's Sosuke!

740
01:38:52,189 --> 01:38:55,317
Look, Ponyo.
It's Koichi!

741
01:39:14,178 --> 01:39:16,147
We made this movie

742
01:39:16,147 --> 01:39:19,674
We made this movie
<i>Ponyo Ponyo Ponyo, tiny little fish</i>

743
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:47,772
<i>Look, I have legs. I'm gonna run</i>

744
01:39:48,212 --> 01:39:51,807
<i>Squishy squeeze, wave them around</i>

745
01:39:52,082 --> 01:39:55,984
<i>Look, I have hands!
Let's hold them now!</i>

746
01:40:14,104 --> 01:40:15,799
<i>Rosy rosy red red</i>

747
01:40:16,073 --> 01:40:19,565
<i>Ponyo Ponyo Ponyo, tiny little fish</i>
