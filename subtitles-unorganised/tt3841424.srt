1
00:01:12,017 --> 00:01:17,433
Denmark, May 1945
Five year German occupation ends.

2
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,167
You there! Stop! Yes you!

3
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:11,333
What is this? That's not yours.
Do you understand?

4
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:18,460
What's the matter?
Do you have a problem? Huh?

5
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:22,460
What do you have now?
Go back home! Get out!

6
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,626
This is not your flag!

7
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:36,918
Please! Please! Stop!

8
00:02:43,835 --> 00:02:48,086
Get up! Up, I said!

9
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:54,003
Here! Take your cap and get out.

10
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:56,211
Asshole!

11
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:59,586
Get out! Get out, I said!

12
00:02:59,753 --> 00:03:02,711
This is my country! Do you understand? Get out!

13
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:08,086
You're not welcome here!

14
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:14,336
Get lost! This is my country! Understood?

15
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:18,962
Get them out of here, man.
Yes, sir. Sergeant.

16
00:05:06,696 --> 00:05:12,623
Land Of Mine

17
00:05:59,844 --> 00:06:04,053
I'm Capt.Ebbe Jensen from the
Danish Pioneer Corps.

18
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:07,469
For those of you who do not
know why you are here:

19
00:06:07,636 --> 00:06:14,137
I have been brought to Denmark
to clean up after the war.

20
00:06:15,845 --> 00:06:20,929
Denmark is not your friend.
You should understand that.

21
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:26,846
Don't expect Danes to receive you with open arms.

22
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,804
No one wants Germans here.

23
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:36,096
And I'm here only for one reason:

24
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:40,930
Clear the Danish west coast of German land mines.

25
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:45,013
Mines that have been planted here.

26
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:50,889
There are approximately 2.2 million
mines along the Danish west coast...

27
00:06:52,264 --> 00:06:57,514
more than, in all European countries put together.

28
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,014
Someone must have thought the
Allied invasion would take place here.

29
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,847
What a shame, whoever had that idea.

30
00:07:07,014 --> 00:07:10,056
And too bad for you.

31
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,140
Who has seen or handled a land mine before?

32
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,348
Has anyone tried to disarm one?

33
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:29,598
Who has seen this before?

34
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:33,973
That's the most common mine.

35
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:42,974
For maximum effect, mines are buried
15 to 20 cms in the sand...

36
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:46,516
which makes them relatively easy to find.

37
00:07:50,475 --> 00:07:53,058
You just lost your hands.

38
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:59,891
Come on. We have no time for self-pity.

39
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:06,225
You're dead.

40
00:08:06,391 --> 00:08:10,476
Here, we have been shown our first death.

41
00:08:10,643 --> 00:08:13,684
If you don't see your family again,

42
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:16,976
will you be the first one to die?

43
00:08:17,143 --> 00:08:21,018
No.
I can't hear you.

44
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:23,893
I will not be the first to die.

45
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:26,934
I'm happy to hear that. Again.

46
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:32,309
Dead again.

47
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,144
The mines here are not duds.

48
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,977
If you do anything wrong,

49
00:08:44,144 --> 00:08:48,727
you will either die or be seriously injured.

50
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:52,269
Is that understood?
Yes, sir. Captain!

51
00:08:52,436 --> 00:08:55,644
Good. Come here.

52
00:08:55,811 --> 00:08:58,644
You are the first man.
Yes, sir. Captain.

53
00:08:58,811 --> 00:09:00,269
Now.

54
00:09:03,852 --> 00:09:06,061
Next.

55
00:09:35,937 --> 00:09:41,355
Excellent. That was fast.
Next.

56
00:10:01,355 --> 00:10:02,897
Faster!

57
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:19,606
Next.

58
00:10:39,108 --> 00:10:40,983
Excellent.

59
00:10:42,524 --> 00:10:43,858
Next.

60
00:10:57,983 --> 00:10:59,775
Next.

61
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:15,609
Next.

62
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:36,319
Next.

63
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,277
Excellent.

64
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,903
Faster!

65
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,820
Come on!

66
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:23,362
Others would have long ago
done all mines by now.

67
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,320
Have you fallen asleep?

68
00:12:28,987 --> 00:12:32,446
Sir. Captain, request permission to retrieve him.

69
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:35,155
Under no circumstance.

70
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,155
Fuck this!

71
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:42,613
I'm coming in.

72
00:12:49,488 --> 00:12:52,488
Let the mine be as it's.
I can do this.

73
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:57,488
Get up, soldier. Get up!
No, I can do this.

74
00:12:57,655 --> 00:13:02,114
Soldier! Get up!
No, please! I know I can handle it.

75
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:12,031
Cover your ears.

76
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,281
Next.

77
00:13:35,074 --> 00:13:37,866
When the mine is disarmed...

78
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:27,034
Elisabeth. Come here.

79
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,160
Come here, baby.

80
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:09,078
Are you soldiers?

81
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,870
Answer me, you dirty swine!
Are you soldiers?

82
00:15:17,037 --> 00:15:18,995
Yes, sir. Sergeant!

83
00:15:19,162 --> 00:15:22,495
Fall on a rank! Now!

84
00:15:24,328 --> 00:15:28,121
Hurry up! Now, now, now, now!

85
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:31,746
Fall on a rank!
Come on!

86
00:15:32,955 --> 00:15:34,538
Attention!

87
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:40,371
Don't you understand 'Attention'?
Yes I do.

88
00:15:40,538 --> 00:15:43,246
Then stand like a man!

89
00:15:46,788 --> 00:15:48,163
At ease!

90
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:58,248
Name?
Marklein, sir. Sergeant.

91
00:15:58,414 --> 00:16:01,831
First name?
Hermann, sir. Sergeant.

92
00:16:01,998 --> 00:16:05,289
Rodolf Selke, sir. Sergeant.
Friedrich Schnurr.

93
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:07,539
Wolff what?
Johann Wolff.

94
00:16:07,706 --> 00:16:09,831
Kluger.
Full name?

95
00:16:09,998 --> 00:16:12,123
August Kluger.
Sir, Sergent.

96
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:16,873
And you two? You look like brothers.

97
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:21,456
We are twins, sir. Sergeant.
Twins?

98
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:23,873
Name?

99
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,957
Werner and Ernst Lessner,
Sir, Sergent.

100
00:16:27,124 --> 00:16:29,416
Did I ask you?
No you did not.

101
00:16:29,582 --> 00:16:31,749
Then shut up.

102
00:16:33,332 --> 00:16:35,957
Pardon me.
What?

103
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,249
What did you say?
Pardon me.

104
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:44,582
Why are you apologizing?
Because I mentioned my brother's name.

105
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:47,207
You are apologizing?
Yes, Sir Sargent.

106
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:54,083
To hell with your excuse!
I can't pardon! Do you understand?

107
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:56,500
Yes, sir. Sergeant.

108
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:04,167
And you, little guy?
Wilhelm Lebern, sir. Sergeant.

109
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:09,084
Are you a soldier?
Yes, sir. Sergeant.

110
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,792
Ludwig Haffke, sir. Sergeant.
Sebastian Schumann, sir. Sergeant.

111
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:17,001
Look at me when you talk.

112
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:28,085
Helmut Morbach, sir. Sergeant.
What a fine uniform.

113
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:32,293
Have you been at war?
Yes, sir. Sergeant.

114
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,377
Are you crying?
No, sir. Sergeant!

115
00:17:38,127 --> 00:17:41,585
What is it? Are you crying?
No, sir. Sergeant!

116
00:17:41,752 --> 00:17:44,960
Are you scared?
No, sir. Sergeant!

117
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,169
Are you homesick?
No, sir. Sergeant!

118
00:18:33,171 --> 00:18:37,838
Can everyone see the black flag out there?
Yes, sir. Sergeant.

119
00:18:38,713 --> 00:18:44,213
Between the flags are 45,000 buried mines.

120
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,046
You must disarm and remove them.

121
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:52,422
When you are finished,
you may be allowed to go home.

122
00:18:53,422 --> 00:18:56,506
Is that understood?
Yes, sir. Sergeant!

123
00:18:56,672 --> 00:19:00,006
Not until they are disarmed, you can get home!
Is that understood?

124
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,922
Yes, sir. Sergeant!

125
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:08,881
If you disarm six mines an hour
and don't blow yourselves up,

126
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:12,464
you may go home in three months.

127
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:15,923
Is that understood?
Yes, sir. Sergeant!

128
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:20,298
You! Did you want to say something?
No, sir. Sergeant.

129
00:19:20,464 --> 00:19:23,799
Are you sure?
Absolutely sure, sir. Sergeant.

130
00:19:25,174 --> 00:19:28,090
You card.
Ludwig, sir. Sergeant.

131
00:19:28,257 --> 00:19:29,924
Give me the map.

132
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:34,674
Can you see it?
Yes, sir!

133
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,132
Each field has a number.

134
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:41,216
The star and the dot show the type of mine.

135
00:19:41,382 --> 00:19:48,549
Those of you who count the mines,
make sure my card is updated.

136
00:19:48,716 --> 00:19:53,175
This task is as important as defusing mines.

137
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:56,633
Is that understood?
Yes, sir. Sergeant!

138
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:04,300
From the stone, mark the water
to create a safety zone.

139
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:10,092
Do I need to tell you what happens
to those who try to escape?

140
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:13,009
No, sir. Sergeant!

141
00:20:42,135 --> 00:20:45,718
One, two, three, four.

142
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:04,178
One, two...

143
00:21:04,345 --> 00:21:07,220
three, four.

144
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:14,303
One, two, three, four.

145
00:21:18,304 --> 00:21:20,596
I have one!

146
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:23,182
I have one!

147
00:22:24,765 --> 00:22:29,015
I have one!
I have one too!

148
00:22:41,765 --> 00:22:46,058
It's not so bad here.

149
00:22:53,142 --> 00:22:56,308
What will I do when I
get back to your family?

150
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,600
I will be a mechanic.

151
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:04,808
One of my father's friends has a good factory.

152
00:23:04,975 --> 00:23:07,892
He would hire me, when I get home.

153
00:23:08,058 --> 00:23:12,559
Aren't you forgetting something?
Mind your own business.

154
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:17,976
Surely he should know that his
fine future is a damn illusion.

155
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:22,476
It's no illusion.
He has already promised me.

156
00:23:22,643 --> 00:23:24,935
And if...
Stop.

157
00:23:32,768 --> 00:23:37,560
Should I ask would he employ an apprentice?

158
00:23:37,727 --> 00:23:40,977
Yes. That would be nice.

159
00:23:41,143 --> 00:23:46,394
Then we can work together.
Yes.

160
00:23:46,561 --> 00:23:50,353
Should I also ask for you, Wilhelm?

161
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:53,478
Stop.
That would be nice.

162
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:55,978
The three...
Helmut.

163
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,519
Shut up!
Stop.

164
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:02,186
The three of us, hand in hand.

165
00:24:07,978 --> 00:24:10,270
What!?

166
00:24:24,354 --> 00:24:27,396
See? I think she has some food.

167
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:32,313
She has some bread.

168
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,813
Hi there.

169
00:24:43,189 --> 00:24:45,939
What is her name?

170
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:51,689
Do you understand German?

171
00:24:55,189 --> 00:24:57,939
She is hurt. See.

172
00:25:04,856 --> 00:25:08,314
A soldier must always be ready to help.

173
00:25:12,857 --> 00:25:18,232
I did not have a doll as a child.
I'm a boy, so I had a car.

174
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:24,732
That should make her better.

175
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,607
Thanks.

176
00:25:26,774 --> 00:25:28,690
You are welcome.

177
00:25:28,857 --> 00:25:31,940
Elisabeth!?

178
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,857
Elisabeth!?

179
00:25:35,024 --> 00:25:37,149
You'd better go.

180
00:25:37,315 --> 00:25:40,274
Elisabeth! Come here, when I call for you.

181
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,025
What are you doing over there?

182
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:49,983
No, you know what?

183
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:54,900
I told you, don't go over to
the fishing house, right?

184
00:25:56,775 --> 00:25:59,358
What is that you don't understand?

185
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:06,358
Don't you understand what I'm saying?
I'm tired of you drifting.

186
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:13,234
It's now, if you need to take a leak.

187
00:26:13,401 --> 00:26:16,234
No? Get to bed.

188
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:19,776
Go now! Move!

189
00:26:21,443 --> 00:26:24,985
Are you all in here?
Yes, sir. Sergeant.

190
00:27:12,654 --> 00:27:15,862
Can't you talk to him?

191
00:27:18,446 --> 00:27:22,821
I haven't eaten in two days.
Does no good complaining.

192
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:28,154
How do I defuse mines on an empty stomach?

193
00:28:01,197 --> 00:28:04,947
It's me, Sebastian.
What do you want?

194
00:28:05,114 --> 00:28:08,948
Do you know, we haven't had anything
to eat in two days, sir. Sergeant?

195
00:28:10,365 --> 00:28:14,448
If we don't get some food...
So what?

196
00:28:17,448 --> 00:28:20,948
Do you think I feel sorry for you?

197
00:28:21,823 --> 00:28:25,907
No, sir. Sergeant.
I fucking don't care.

198
00:28:26,073 --> 00:28:29,907
I don't care if you are nasty.
I know, sir. Sergeant.

199
00:28:30,073 --> 00:28:35,323
I don't know when the food comes.
The Germans are not ahead of the game.

200
00:28:45,616 --> 00:28:48,241
Good night, Sebastian.

201
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:53,033
Back to bed.

202
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:57,741
Put yourselves to sleep!
Get in the bed!

203
00:29:44,161 --> 00:29:46,452
Psst...

204
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:50,411
Where are you going?
Shh! Just sleep now.

205
00:29:51,452 --> 00:29:55,244
Are you running away?
I need to find something to eat.

206
00:30:13,454 --> 00:30:16,829
He can't. I know my brother.

207
00:30:16,995 --> 00:30:21,829
I saw him this morning, vomiting constantly.

208
00:30:21,995 --> 00:30:25,121
Look at me when you talk to me.

209
00:30:26,871 --> 00:30:30,329
Ernst?
That's right, sir. Sergeant.

210
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:34,622
Look at me!
He's right. I'm not feeling well.

211
00:30:34,788 --> 00:30:38,080
If only you could allow me
to rest an hour, please.

212
00:30:38,247 --> 00:30:42,455
Ernst, you know, I can't allow that.

213
00:30:42,622 --> 00:30:46,705
Well I feel sick...
He may not be up for it, please sir. Sergeant.

214
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:56,664
You are a little warm,
but you can work, right?

215
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,789
Sir. Sergeant

216
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:08,248
What do you say, Otto?
Should we leave them to rest an hour? Shall we?

217
00:31:08,415 --> 00:31:12,206
Should we let them rest?
He could pass out.

218
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,498
Do you think they're trying to cheat us?
What?

219
00:31:22,082 --> 00:31:25,582
No, they wouldn't dare.

220
00:31:25,748 --> 00:31:28,915
Well? No, they wouldn't dare.

221
00:31:29,082 --> 00:31:31,540
Look at me, boys.

222
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:36,458
Back to work.
But...sir. Sergeant

223
00:31:36,624 --> 00:31:40,749
Do you hear me?
Back to work, I said! Now!

224
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:44,958
Move it now!

225
00:33:45,422 --> 00:33:48,380
Wilhelm? Wilhelm?

226
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,965
Somethings wrong.
Take off my helmet.

227
00:34:25,673 --> 00:34:28,591
Take off this shit helmet.

228
00:34:28,757 --> 00:34:30,383
Help me!

229
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:38,633
I want to go home.
Quiet now.

230
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:42,133
You'll be all right.

231
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:46,383
Helmut, help me to get him
away from this beach.

232
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:54,841
Help me.
You will be OK. Take it easy.

233
00:34:55,008 --> 00:34:56,884
Calm down.

234
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:01,092
Hey! Help me out!
Why did you help him?

235
00:35:03,176 --> 00:35:05,592
Help me!

236
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:11,634
I want to go home! I want to go home!

237
00:35:14,801 --> 00:35:16,717
Help me!
Calm down.

238
00:35:21,176 --> 00:35:23,717
Help!
Calm down.

239
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:42,344
Help me! Help me!
Sir. Sergeant! We need help!

240
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:48,010
I want to go home!
Don't worry. Look at me.

241
00:35:48,177 --> 00:35:51,677
It will be OK.
You'll make it.

242
00:35:51,844 --> 00:35:56,137
Mother! Mother!
Sir. Sergeant, help us!

243
00:35:57,262 --> 00:36:00,637
Do something! Please! Help us!

244
00:36:00,803 --> 00:36:03,512
Come here! Please! Help us!

245
00:36:03,678 --> 00:36:07,387
Sir. Sergeant!
Mother!

246
00:36:08,678 --> 00:36:11,053
Mother! I want to go home!

247
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:17,262
Look at me. You will go home.
It will be OK. Trust me.

248
00:36:17,428 --> 00:36:20,345
I don't want this anymore!

249
00:36:22,804 --> 00:36:25,638
I want to go home!

250
00:36:25,805 --> 00:36:29,013
I want to...I want to...

251
00:36:39,055 --> 00:36:41,471
Thank you, sir. Sergeant.

252
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:17,098
What's going on?
It's my fault, sir. Sergeant.

253
00:37:17,265 --> 00:37:21,390
Your fault?
It's my fault. We were...

254
00:37:21,556 --> 00:37:25,391
Look at me when you talk to me!
We were so hungry last night that,

255
00:37:25,557 --> 00:37:31,182
I stole some fodder from the farm.
That's why we have become ill.

256
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:35,599
As an officer it's my responsibility,
that everyone gets some food.

257
00:37:35,766 --> 00:37:39,141
You have no responsibility here.

258
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:49,516
Where is your mother?

259
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:03,975
When I say there is no food here,
that's how it's.

260
00:38:04,142 --> 00:38:05,975
What is this?

261
00:38:06,142 --> 00:38:09,017
If they ate it, they would get sick.

262
00:38:09,226 --> 00:38:12,809
It's full of rat feces. Look...

263
00:38:12,976 --> 00:38:15,226
What is so funny?

264
00:38:15,392 --> 00:38:19,017
Anyway, I get to ram the Germans.

265
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:28,310
What did she laugh at?
Listen, kid...

266
00:38:28,477 --> 00:38:31,852
we don't speak to one another.
Is that understood?

267
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:36,227
You don't talk to me!
I ask and you answer.

268
00:38:36,394 --> 00:38:40,685
And always with 'Sir, Sergeant'. Understand?
Yes, sir. Sergeant.

269
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:49,060
Why did you do something?
I was not offered anything.

270
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,103
Throw up!

271
00:39:06,603 --> 00:39:11,187
Drink, drink, drink! Down with it! Come on!

272
00:39:11,353 --> 00:39:14,187
Seawater!
Would you like to die instead?

273
00:39:17,145 --> 00:39:20,438
All right, boys. Drink.

274
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:30,146
Wash yourselves.

275
00:39:34,146 --> 00:39:36,605
Wash yourselves. Lower your head.

276
00:39:36,771 --> 00:39:41,021
Wash yourselves good.
Down with the head.

277
00:39:41,855 --> 00:39:46,980
You are good, you are good.
Come on. Here, come on. Come on. Sit.

278
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:16,398
Get to bed.

279
00:40:17,731 --> 00:40:21,399
May I show you something, Sir. Sergeant?

280
00:40:21,565 --> 00:40:24,816
I said, get to bed.
I want to show you something.

281
00:40:29,607 --> 00:40:34,441
With this framework, its easier to clear mines.

282
00:40:34,607 --> 00:40:40,941
With this the area is bounded,
so we can look for mines.

283
00:40:41,107 --> 00:40:44,399
Fine! I understand. I'm not stupid.

284
00:40:44,566 --> 00:40:49,817
I understand.
Take your toy and get back to bed.

285
00:40:49,983 --> 00:40:52,484
I know why you hate us,

286
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:57,150
and don't care whether we get
blown up or die of hunger.

287
00:40:57,317 --> 00:40:58,734
Yes. You are correct.

288
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:03,234
But it's not good that we die while
we clear the mines on the beach.

289
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:09,192
I don't care.
Take your toy and get to bed.

290
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,150
The beach must be cleared of mines,
is it not, sir. Sergeant?

291
00:41:13,317 --> 00:41:17,901
Yes, I understand that.
Do you understand you need to get to bed now?

292
00:41:18,068 --> 00:41:21,777
All I ask is you listen.

293
00:41:21,943 --> 00:41:24,735
Then hurry up.
Do you understand me?

294
00:41:24,902 --> 00:41:27,693
Do I understand you?
Do you understand me?

295
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,443
Yes, sir. Sergeant.
Take your toy and get back to bed.

296
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,402
Come on.

297
00:41:38,902 --> 00:41:40,652
Good night, sir. Sergeant.

298
00:42:27,738 --> 00:42:30,446
Good morning.
Good morning.

299
00:42:31,738 --> 00:42:35,029
A Wilhelm Lebern?
Yes.

300
00:42:36,029 --> 00:42:38,821
He came in, a couple of days ago.

301
00:42:42,571 --> 00:42:45,739
Wilhelm died yesterday.

302
00:42:48,072 --> 00:42:51,197
He's still here, if you would like to see him.

303
00:42:51,364 --> 00:42:55,364
No. No, it's not necessary.
Thanks.

304
00:43:51,783 --> 00:43:54,200
Get up, boys!

305
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,867
Stand up!

306
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,909
Line up!

307
00:45:17,996 --> 00:45:19,996
Fall in!

308
00:45:28,371 --> 00:45:30,621
At ease!

309
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,079
I have good and bad news.

310
00:45:36,246 --> 00:45:39,788
The good thing is, I just visited Wilhelm.

311
00:45:39,955 --> 00:45:42,705
He is feeling better.

312
00:45:43,997 --> 00:45:48,580
They are taking good care of him,
and he will live.

313
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:53,747
You should greet him.
He will go home soon.

314
00:45:56,831 --> 00:46:00,164
The bad news is that
we are behind schedule.

315
00:46:00,331 --> 00:46:04,581
For the rest of the week we need to
disarm eight mines an hour.

316
00:46:04,747 --> 00:46:07,956
Is that understood?
Yes, sir. Sergeant.

317
00:46:08,122 --> 00:46:11,623
I can't hear you!
Yes, sir. Sergeant!

318
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,498
Good.

319
00:46:14,832 --> 00:46:20,582
We depart in ten minutes.
Finish up eating.

320
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:19,043
As soon as I get home,
I will have beer and girls.

321
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:24,085
Yeah? Do you have a girlfriend back home?
No, I'll go straight out and get one.

322
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:29,210
Won't you be visiting your parents first?
They can wait.

323
00:47:29,376 --> 00:47:31,626
What is your plan?

324
00:47:31,793 --> 00:47:36,043
Make a lot of money, right?
Namely with my friend.

325
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:39,211
And what work would that be?
As masons, of course.

326
00:47:39,377 --> 00:47:43,919
The Reich needs to be rebuilt.
That will be our task.

327
00:47:44,086 --> 00:47:47,711
Werner, Ernst and sons.
And sons?

328
00:47:47,878 --> 00:47:50,461
Our sons will take over the company.

329
00:47:50,628 --> 00:47:54,086
Sounds better, when we use 'and sons'.

330
00:47:54,253 --> 00:47:58,919
We own the company and no one would
detect that there are no sons.

331
00:47:59,086 --> 00:48:02,711
Good idea! 'Ludwig and Sons'.
Sounds great, right?

332
00:48:02,878 --> 00:48:07,087
Yes. Almost as good as
'Werner, Ernst and Sons'.

333
00:48:07,254 --> 00:48:10,004
Shut up! This is heavy.

334
00:48:26,004 --> 00:48:28,296
Gently, I said!

335
00:48:31,212 --> 00:48:34,921
How many anti-tank mines are there?
44. Sir, Sargent.

336
00:48:35,088 --> 00:48:39,422
Count them again.
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12...

337
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:44,130
14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26...

338
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:46,964
44. Sir, Sargent.
And the S mines?

339
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:51,422
16. Sir, Sargent.
Count them again.

340
00:49:03,797 --> 00:49:07,965
What shall we call it?
Benny. He's called Benny.

341
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:12,798
Benny, Benny, Benny.

342
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,590
No, it shall be called Timmy.
No.

343
00:49:16,757 --> 00:49:20,090
Is it because of the color?
What has Timmy got to do with black?

344
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:23,132
It just sounds black.

345
00:49:24,132 --> 00:49:26,465
Benny is fine.

346
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,049
Lets call it...

347
00:49:31,965 --> 00:49:35,466
Tim Benny.
Tim is its first name.

348
00:49:35,633 --> 00:49:40,675
Benny is its last name.
No. No, my friend.

349
00:49:43,466 --> 00:49:46,633
Come on, Tim Benny.

350
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,550
Look at the purple color.

351
00:49:50,716 --> 00:49:53,383
A beautiful insect.

352
00:49:54,341 --> 00:49:59,050
What kind of insect is it?
A six-legger.

353
00:49:59,217 --> 00:50:02,717
A bark beetle.
No.

354
00:50:02,883 --> 00:50:06,343
Benny Tim, the bark beetle.

355
00:50:06,509 --> 00:50:11,134
Benny Tim, the six-legged bark beetle.
Yes.

356
00:50:11,301 --> 00:50:14,968
Benny Tim, the six-legger?

357
00:50:19,551 --> 00:50:22,301
So back to bed, boys.

358
00:50:25,676 --> 00:50:27,343
Sebastian.

359
00:50:30,968 --> 00:50:33,344
Everyone here?

360
00:50:34,761 --> 00:50:39,344
Are you all here?
Yes, sir. Sergeant.

361
00:51:21,096 --> 00:51:24,429
Stop! Look at him!

362
00:51:24,596 --> 00:51:27,762
Close your mouth!
Stop!

363
00:51:31,138 --> 00:51:35,972
Stop!
Close as your mouth!

364
00:51:37,555 --> 00:51:41,597
Stop! Stop it!

365
00:51:44,805 --> 00:51:49,972
Shoot the bastard right between the eyes!
Gentlemen?

366
00:51:50,139 --> 00:51:53,639
Look, how Nazi boys care of each other.

367
00:51:57,097 --> 00:52:00,848
One two...
Up with the head!

368
00:52:01,723 --> 00:52:06,306
Gentlemen, look here.
Please! Please, I need these boys.

369
00:52:09,348 --> 00:52:12,598
Who the fuck are you?
Sergeant Carl Rasmussen.

370
00:52:12,765 --> 00:52:15,973
This is my Unit.
My assignment is to clean the beach.

371
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:19,515
I need these boys.
I need all of them.

372
00:52:29,182 --> 00:52:33,974
Needs them to work.
Fucking Danes.

373
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:46,891
Go inside, boys.

374
00:52:56,308 --> 00:52:58,225
Come, Ludwig.

375
00:53:01,226 --> 00:53:04,309
Ludwig. Go and wash him.

376
00:53:09,143 --> 00:53:12,059
Hey!?

377
00:53:12,226 --> 00:53:16,351
What the hell are you doing, Ebbe?
I just got them up and running.

378
00:53:16,518 --> 00:53:19,268
Do you know, I don't think there was an order,

379
00:53:19,434 --> 00:53:22,643
to steal food for the Germans from the kitchen.

380
00:53:22,809 --> 00:53:25,934
I'll let myself and my dog when I want.

381
00:53:27,434 --> 00:53:31,769
People talk. Pain in the ass.
Isn't that you?

382
00:53:31,935 --> 00:53:35,144
No, but isn't it strange.
You have to steal food,

383
00:53:35,311 --> 00:53:38,561
when we pay the farm
for your room and boarding.

384
00:53:38,727 --> 00:53:42,602
Do you hear what I'm saying?
Look at me when I talk to you.

385
00:53:44,352 --> 00:53:48,227
You could have told me,
I would get small boys.

386
00:53:48,394 --> 00:53:52,061
It changes the situation a little.
I don't think it does.

387
00:53:52,227 --> 00:53:56,936
If they are old enough to go to war,
they are old enough to clean up.

388
00:53:57,103 --> 00:53:59,645
The boys have no idea what is going on.

389
00:53:59,812 --> 00:54:03,895
No, but you must teach them that, Carl.
That's why you're here.

390
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:10,062
You haven't started liking them, right?

391
00:54:13,729 --> 00:54:15,687
No.

392
00:54:15,854 --> 00:54:18,979
Remember what they did.

393
00:54:19,145 --> 00:54:21,812
Better them than us.

394
00:54:24,812 --> 00:54:30,022
Could you help me get some
experienced men to my unit?

395
00:55:32,358 --> 00:55:33,691
Shit!

396
00:55:34,941 --> 00:55:37,399
Ludwig, stop!

397
00:55:38,566 --> 00:55:43,149
Ludwig! There are two mines
on top of one another!

398
00:55:43,316 --> 00:55:46,483
Stop! There are two mines
on top of one another!

399
00:55:46,649 --> 00:55:48,608
Werner! Stop!

400
00:55:50,983 --> 00:55:54,776
I got you now, you little bugger.

401
00:55:54,942 --> 00:55:57,942
Werner! Stop!

402
00:56:09,234 --> 00:56:13,401
Werner! Werner, where are you?

403
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:17,318
Werner! Werner!

404
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:22,401
Werner, where are you?

405
00:56:22,568 --> 00:56:26,402
Ernst, sit down.
Werner? Werner!

406
00:56:26,569 --> 00:56:29,235
Werner, where are you?
Say something!

407
00:56:30,735 --> 00:56:35,360
Werner, where are you?
Ernst, calm down.

408
00:57:09,278 --> 00:57:12,445
Get off me!
Take it easy.

409
00:57:12,612 --> 00:57:14,695
We must look for him!

410
00:57:14,862 --> 00:57:18,279
Get off me!
Hold him down.

411
00:57:20,456 --> 00:57:24,988
Werner!
Hold him down. Hold him down.

412
00:57:25,113 --> 00:57:28,321
Calm down.
Take it easy, kid.

413
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,530
That's good.

414
00:57:41,363 --> 00:57:43,697
Out now, boys.

415
00:57:46,988 --> 00:57:49,113
Sebastian, out.

416
00:57:54,281 --> 00:57:56,614
You have to sleep.

417
00:58:03,614 --> 00:58:07,906
No. Take it easy.
We must look for Werner.

418
00:58:08,073 --> 00:58:11,906
We'll look for Werner tomorrow.
Now you need to sleep.

419
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:15,281
Come on.
I will find Werner first.

420
00:58:15,448 --> 00:58:21,324
We must get down to the beach.
I would have saved him, but he ran away.

421
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:24,449
We must find him.

422
00:58:24,616 --> 00:58:26,907
He slept there.

423
00:58:27,074 --> 00:58:31,574
I can't fall asleep without him.

424
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:34,908
Come on.
No. You have to sleep.

425
00:58:35,074 --> 00:58:37,908
We'll look for him tomorrow.

426
00:58:38,074 --> 00:58:41,241
Tomorrow? That sounds good.

427
00:58:48,033 --> 00:58:52,242
When we find Werner...

428
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:56,159
I'll take him to Germany,

429
00:58:56,325 --> 00:59:01,409
and build it all up again.
We'll build it all up.

430
00:59:01,576 --> 00:59:07,451
The country is in ruins.
It needs to be rebuilt.

431
00:59:09,076 --> 00:59:13,034
Masons...we have to be masons.

432
00:59:13,201 --> 00:59:15,284
It's a good job.

433
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:19,827
Sir. Sergeant...
Don't hate him.

434
00:59:19,993 --> 00:59:25,368
I don't.
Don't hate him.

435
00:59:28,952 --> 00:59:34,160
No. Lie down.
Relax. You have to sleep now.

436
00:59:34,327 --> 00:59:41,827
If you knew him as I did,
that would have helped.

437
01:00:40,163 --> 01:00:42,955
I lied to you.

438
01:00:46,372 --> 01:00:49,497
Wilhelm did not survive.

439
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:54,289
I know, sir. Sergeant.

440
01:00:55,289 --> 01:01:01,414
It was best that way, so that we could
continue with the mine clearance.

441
01:01:02,623 --> 01:01:06,498
So that we may go home one day.

442
01:01:06,664 --> 01:01:08,789
Perhaps.

443
01:01:19,582 --> 01:01:22,832
Don't worry. I won't take it from you.

444
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:28,707
Does the cross help you?

445
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:47,292
You can try it on, sir. Sergeant.
No.

446
01:01:47,459 --> 01:01:52,000
Come on, sir. Sergeant.
Just try.

447
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:56,625
No.
I mean it, sir. Sergeant. Try.

448
01:02:16,627 --> 01:02:18,918
My father gave it to me.

449
01:02:21,377 --> 01:02:26,210
He always did like that and
I would startle every time.

450
01:02:29,627 --> 01:02:32,710
That's why I have it on all the time.

451
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,627
Is your father alive?

452
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:49,586
I don't know.

453
01:04:35,716 --> 01:04:38,466
Sebastian.
Hermann.

454
01:04:40,425 --> 01:04:43,550
Rodolf.
August.

455
01:04:45,133 --> 01:04:47,050
Johann.
Johann.

456
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:50,133
Come, Friedrich.
Helmut, you're on our team.

457
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,050
Come, Helmut! Wake up!

458
01:05:01,717 --> 01:05:05,967
Well, Helmut! Such!

459
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:12,426
Shoot!

460
01:05:24,968 --> 01:05:29,343
August! I can't do it alone!
I need some help here!

461
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:32,218
Not again, you idiot!

462
01:05:32,385 --> 01:05:36,343
It's football, not handball.
Down to earth, thank you.

463
01:05:37,802 --> 01:05:40,969
Ludwig, come here!

464
01:05:45,469 --> 01:05:47,553
We play on!

465
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:49,428
Who is that?
A new one.

466
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:56,136
Hello.

467
01:05:58,345 --> 01:06:02,720
He must join the unit.
Where is Sergeant Rasmussen?

468
01:06:03,678 --> 01:06:07,553
There he is. But I can take him with me.
My name is Ludwig.

469
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:11,637
Josef Becker.
Albert Brauer.

470
01:06:11,804 --> 01:06:14,429
Come on. We have the day off.

471
01:06:53,097 --> 01:06:56,972
What's your name?
Tell me.

472
01:06:59,014 --> 01:07:00,931
Take it easy.

473
01:07:05,681 --> 01:07:07,557
Stay there.

474
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:14,140
It will all be good.

475
01:07:15,515 --> 01:07:18,849
One, two, three! Run!

476
01:07:36,391 --> 01:07:40,225
Morbach has beaten the world record!

477
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:44,475
Look here!

478
01:07:53,058 --> 01:07:55,850
The first goal was fantastic.

479
01:07:56,017 --> 01:07:58,183
Next time we will win.

480
01:07:59,267 --> 01:08:01,433
Come on. Come on.

481
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:04,350
Do you think?

482
01:08:07,018 --> 01:08:10,518
Here, Otto. Come on. Come on.

483
01:08:10,685 --> 01:08:15,768
Here. Hopti. Come on. Come on.

484
01:08:15,935 --> 01:08:19,268
The water was lovely.

485
01:08:19,435 --> 01:08:23,893
We have some beautiful dunes.
Yes. You must explore.

486
01:10:07,898 --> 01:10:12,732
Soldier Ludwig Haffke.
You were responsible for field 7, right?

487
01:10:12,898 --> 01:10:16,190
Yes, sir. Sergeant.
Everything has been accounted for.

488
01:10:16,357 --> 01:10:21,565
1,200 mines were buried, 1200 were found, disarmed and accounted for.

489
01:10:21,732 --> 01:10:27,107
But you have counted wrong, right?
No, I counted them twice.

490
01:10:27,274 --> 01:10:31,233
1,200 mines were buried and
1200 mines were removed.

491
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:47,316
Get the ball.

492
01:10:47,483 --> 01:10:49,567
Get the ball!

493
01:10:50,567 --> 01:10:53,358
Like a dog! With your mouth!

494
01:10:58,567 --> 01:11:01,651
Good dog. Very good dog.

495
01:11:03,651 --> 01:11:06,276
Get the ball. Quick!

496
01:11:07,568 --> 01:11:09,693
Without the hands! Use your mouth!

497
01:11:17,693 --> 01:11:20,235
Good dog.

498
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:23,651
Good dog. Yeah? Good dog.

499
01:11:23,818 --> 01:11:26,026
Good dog. Sit!

500
01:11:31,486 --> 01:11:32,902
Bark!

501
01:11:33,069 --> 01:11:35,486
Bark!
Woof, sir. Sergeant.

502
01:11:35,652 --> 01:11:38,194
What?
Woof.

503
01:11:38,361 --> 01:11:40,069
Louder.

504
01:11:40,236 --> 01:11:42,694
Bark! Louder!

505
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,257
Woof.

506
01:11:48,278 --> 01:11:51,653
Is there anything you want to say?
What? Is there?

507
01:11:51,819 --> 01:11:54,653
Anything you want to say? Huh?

508
01:11:56,111 --> 01:12:00,070
Maybe...
Please stop, sir. Sergeant.

509
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:06,404
Idiot!

510
01:12:07,695 --> 01:12:09,945
You're all idiots!

511
01:12:10,112 --> 01:12:14,987
I have a bunch of German idiots! Do you hear?
Each and every one of you!

512
01:12:15,904 --> 01:12:20,654
How can I now guarantee the beach is safe?
Tell me!

513
01:12:20,821 --> 01:12:26,987
Sir. Sargent, we could count them again
to see if the numbers match.

514
01:12:27,154 --> 01:12:32,447
If the numbers match?
What do I need the numbers for now? Huh?

515
01:12:32,613 --> 01:12:36,238
What should we use it for?
What for? Huh?

516
01:12:36,405 --> 01:12:39,947
Can you guarantee the beach is safe?
Can you?

517
01:12:40,114 --> 01:12:43,905
No, sir. Sergeant!
Then keep your mouth shut!

518
01:12:46,655 --> 01:12:50,114
I've been too kind to you.

519
01:12:53,364 --> 01:12:57,030
That's the problem.
And you got used to it!

520
01:13:36,033 --> 01:13:40,700
From now on you go along.

521
01:13:40,866 --> 01:13:44,283
Arm in arm.
Next to each other.

522
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:48,116
Through all the cleared fields.

523
01:13:48,283 --> 01:13:53,616
I must assure myself there are no mistakes!

524
01:13:53,783 --> 01:13:56,742
It was a mistake to trust you.

525
01:13:58,076 --> 01:14:02,451
But it's over now.
Is that understood?

526
01:14:02,618 --> 01:14:06,576
Is that understood?
Yes, sir. Sergeant!

527
01:14:08,409 --> 01:14:12,409
You might as well put us up
against the wall and shoot us.

528
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:18,159
Do you have something to say, soldier?

529
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:27,827
Are you laughing?

530
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:37,994
Are you laughing?
Do you think I'm funny?

531
01:14:41,244 --> 01:14:45,202
Do you think I'm funny?
Laughing are you, soldier?

532
01:14:45,369 --> 01:14:49,744
No, sir. Sergeant!
Why are you laughing then?

533
01:14:51,161 --> 01:14:53,661
Why are you laughing?

534
01:14:55,662 --> 01:14:58,245
Are you a man?
Yes, sir. Sergeant!

535
01:14:58,412 --> 01:15:00,704
Are you a soldier?
Yes, sir. Sergeant!

536
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:03,995
So act like a soldier!
Is that clear?

537
01:15:04,162 --> 01:15:06,579
Yes, sir. Sergeant!

538
01:15:07,829 --> 01:15:11,537
You still think I'm funny?
No, sir. Sergeant.

539
01:15:11,704 --> 01:15:14,287
Pull yourself together!

540
01:15:17,037 --> 01:15:19,662
Man up!

541
01:15:31,622 --> 01:15:34,788
Is there anyone who has something to say?

542
01:15:37,747 --> 01:15:40,497
Tell me now.

543
01:15:40,663 --> 01:15:43,913
Is there anyone who has something to say?

544
01:16:04,998 --> 01:16:08,581
Excellent. Forward march!

545
01:16:10,248 --> 01:16:13,790
Come on! Forward march!

546
01:16:15,373 --> 01:16:19,707
Through all the cleared fields!
Centimeter by centimeter!

547
01:16:19,873 --> 01:16:23,249
Until we are absolutely sure!

548
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:55,920
Let's run away, before we all die.

549
01:18:02,962 --> 01:18:07,754
Are you deaf?
Did you just find yourselves in it?

550
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,462
I rather, the British shoot us.

551
01:18:11,629 --> 01:18:15,379
We'll be here until we're done.
Then we go home.

552
01:18:15,545 --> 01:18:19,046
The sergeant said we go
home when we're done.

553
01:18:19,213 --> 01:18:24,546
The sergeant? You think, your friend,
the sergeant would keep his word?

554
01:18:27,505 --> 01:18:32,338
Continue this death march,
please, please please!

555
01:18:32,505 --> 01:18:35,588
But don't tell me what to do!

556
01:18:35,755 --> 01:18:39,547
And what happens to us,
when he realizes you're gone?

557
01:18:40,922 --> 01:18:45,338
I can't allow it.
It's not your decision!

558
01:18:45,505 --> 01:18:48,964
I'm out of here!
You stay here!

559
01:18:52,298 --> 01:18:57,464
A fat-head you are!
He hates you, just as he hates us all!

560
01:18:57,631 --> 01:19:01,381
Maybe you can make sergeant like us?

561
01:19:01,548 --> 01:19:03,798
Take him!
Tie him!

562
01:19:05,381 --> 01:19:09,756
Tie him up, I said!
Get off me!

563
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,298
Damned traitors!

564
01:19:16,465 --> 01:19:19,674
Get off me! Get off me!

565
01:19:25,341 --> 01:19:27,258
Keep your mouth shut.

566
01:19:28,174 --> 01:19:30,633
Keep your mouth shut.

567
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:29,385
Carl! Carl!

568
01:20:31,677 --> 01:20:34,677
Where's the sergeant? Where's the sergeant?

569
01:20:34,844 --> 01:20:37,052
Help! Help! My little girl!

570
01:20:37,219 --> 01:20:40,177
My little girl! Help me!

571
01:20:40,344 --> 01:20:43,719
Help! My little girl!

572
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:02,303
Elisabeth! Elisabeth!

573
01:21:03,970 --> 01:21:08,262
Sit down, honey.
Someone will come help you.

574
01:21:31,055 --> 01:21:33,263
Wake up!

575
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:36,430
Ernst, where are the others?

576
01:21:36,596 --> 01:21:38,888
Wake up, kid!

577
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:43,263
Hey? Where are the others?
Did they run away?

578
01:21:55,181 --> 01:21:59,306
You must be seated. Be seated.

579
01:22:02,223 --> 01:22:05,056
You must sit still.

580
01:22:05,223 --> 01:22:08,098
Shortly one of the boys
will come get you out.

581
01:22:24,182 --> 01:22:25,307
Ernst!

582
01:22:27,891 --> 01:22:30,266
Ernst!

583
01:22:34,182 --> 01:22:36,099
Hi there.

584
01:22:39,683 --> 01:22:42,350
Did she heal?

585
01:23:06,476 --> 01:23:08,101
Here?

586
01:23:12,518 --> 01:23:14,477
Here?

587
01:23:20,102 --> 01:23:22,977
Did you know Werner?

588
01:23:23,143 --> 01:23:26,352
He's a good brother.
He looks like me on a bullet.

589
01:23:28,768 --> 01:23:30,977
I would do anything for him.

590
01:23:35,810 --> 01:23:37,602
It's all good. It's all good.

591
01:23:43,353 --> 01:23:45,811
Ernst, give her to me.

592
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:10,813
Come here, Ernst.

593
01:24:13,938 --> 01:24:17,979
Ernst, come please.
Ernst, come here.

594
01:24:18,146 --> 01:24:20,938
Ernst, come here!

595
01:24:21,104 --> 01:24:24,188
Ernst. What are you doing?
Ernst, come here!

596
01:24:24,354 --> 01:24:29,188
Ernst, came back.
Come on, Ernst.

597
01:24:29,355 --> 01:24:32,688
What are you doing?
Come back.

598
01:25:22,399 --> 01:25:24,941
Wipe your eyes.

599
01:25:26,774 --> 01:25:30,774
Repeat with me, 'It will soon be over'.
It will soon be over.

600
01:25:30,941 --> 01:25:34,649
I'm coming home soon.
I'm coming home soon.

601
01:25:36,524 --> 01:25:38,525
Okay?
Yes.

602
01:25:38,692 --> 01:25:41,025
Stop crying.

603
01:25:44,317 --> 01:25:48,609
I need you. The other needs you. Okay?

604
01:25:49,609 --> 01:25:55,150
Be strong. Can you do it?
Yes. I can do that.

605
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:58,025
You are strong.
I'm strong.

606
01:25:58,192 --> 01:26:00,775
Say it again.
I'm strong.

607
01:26:00,942 --> 01:26:04,317
I'm coming home soon.
I'm coming home soon.

608
01:26:07,276 --> 01:26:09,693
It will soon be over.

609
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:12,610
Thanks.

610
01:27:48,572 --> 01:27:51,156
Gustav?
Yes.

611
01:27:51,322 --> 01:27:54,447
What are you going to do,
when you go home?

612
01:27:54,614 --> 01:27:57,364
Eat! I just need to eat.

613
01:27:57,531 --> 01:28:02,322
My mother is the best cook in Berlin.
I'm tired of the Danish pigswill.

614
01:28:02,489 --> 01:28:04,907
You must invite us to your home.

615
01:28:05,074 --> 01:28:08,824
Yes, come to Oranienburger Strasse in Berlin,

616
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:13,490
and you will get potatoes, meat and gravy.

617
01:28:13,657 --> 01:28:15,824
The best.
Yes, the best.

618
01:28:59,034 --> 01:29:01,159
Bloody hell!

619
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:46,161
Go.

620
01:30:23,288 --> 01:30:25,496
Sit down.
What do you want?

621
01:30:26,496 --> 01:30:29,663
We need more experienced people at Skallingen.

622
01:30:29,829 --> 01:30:32,330
Yes, but I need them at Ringkobing.

623
01:30:32,497 --> 01:30:36,622
Yes, please. It's not you, I'm talking about.

624
01:30:38,830 --> 01:30:41,122
What are we talking about?

625
01:30:42,414 --> 01:30:45,914
Your German boys.

626
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:50,331
We need them down there.
People, who can die like flies.

627
01:30:53,706 --> 01:30:56,872
The mines have budged.
It's a place of chaos.

628
01:30:57,039 --> 01:30:59,582
We need experienced Germans.

629
01:30:59,748 --> 01:31:03,665
I wish I could help you,
but they have been sent home.

630
01:31:03,832 --> 01:31:05,957
Mm. That I heard.

631
01:31:06,123 --> 01:31:10,332
Four out of 14 made it.
But they will not be sent back.

632
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:16,415
I promised, they can go home when done.
And we're done.

633
01:31:16,582 --> 01:31:20,749
All German soldiers must stay,
until all mines are cleared.

634
01:31:20,915 --> 01:31:23,374
And I mean, all.

635
01:31:26,374 --> 01:31:28,458
Ebbe?

636
01:31:37,041 --> 01:31:40,500
I ask you to send those boys home.

637
01:31:40,666 --> 01:31:43,833
Just let them go.
They will die down there.

638
01:31:46,375 --> 01:31:49,167
I understand, Carl.

639
01:31:49,333 --> 01:31:52,458
But I can't. The Order has been given.

640
01:31:52,625 --> 01:31:56,667
It's just four boys!
Now you hear what I say!

641
01:31:56,833 --> 01:31:59,459
If I hear anymore about those boys,

642
01:31:59,626 --> 01:32:03,459
I'll shoot them myself one by one.

643
01:32:03,626 --> 01:32:08,418
They are not good people.
You don't know what is on their conscience.

644
01:32:08,584 --> 01:32:12,626
You lied to me, right from day one.

645
01:32:12,793 --> 01:32:16,460
They are little boys.
Little boys who cry for their mothers,

646
01:32:16,626 --> 01:32:20,876
when they get scared or blowup arms and legs.

647
01:32:23,585 --> 01:32:28,211
They're Germans, Carl.
The order has been given.

648
01:32:28,377 --> 01:32:31,044
Find yourself out.

649
01:32:32,086 --> 01:32:36,169
Thank you for today, Carl.
Shut up!

650
01:32:39,586 --> 01:32:41,919
Ebbe...

651
01:32:42,544 --> 01:32:45,169
That would be all, Carl.

652
01:33:00,379 --> 01:33:05,379
We assume, there are 72,000 German mines,

653
01:33:05,546 --> 01:33:08,921
buried here at Skallingen.

654
01:33:09,087 --> 01:33:12,837
Some of you may have had the luxury,

655
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:17,837
to detail available cards.

656
01:33:18,004 --> 01:33:22,921
Here at Skallingen we don't have such cards.

657
01:33:40,964 --> 01:33:44,547
Helmut Morbach?
Yes.

658
01:33:44,714 --> 01:33:47,714
Rodolf Selke?
Yes.

659
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:50,630
Ludwig Haffke?
Yes.

660
01:33:50,797 --> 01:33:52,589
Sebastian Schumann?

661
01:33:52,755 --> 01:33:56,715
Come up.
Come on! Come up!

662
01:34:15,298 --> 01:34:18,757
Get out! All of you.
Come on. Out!

663
01:34:26,091 --> 01:34:28,216
You must go that way.

664
01:34:28,383 --> 01:34:31,633
The boundary's about 500 meters from here.

665
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:34,675
And you will be in Germany.

666
01:34:34,841 --> 01:34:36,925
Run.

667
01:34:38,383 --> 01:34:40,050
Run!

668
01:35:34,807 --> 01:35:41,058
After the war, over 2000 German prisoners were forced to clear
more than 1.5 million land mines from the Danish west coast.

669
01:35:42,017 --> 01:35:46,100
Almost half of them died or were severely injured.

670
01:35:47,058 --> 01:35:51,286
Many of them were just very young boys.
