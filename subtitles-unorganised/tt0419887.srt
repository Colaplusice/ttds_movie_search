1
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,840
-You ready?
-Yeah. Let's go.

2
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,654
-Is that what I think it is?
-I think so.

3
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,885
-You nervous?
-As long as they spelled my name right.

4
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:29,500
-You want a moment alone with it?
-I want you right here with me.

5
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,544
There it is.

6
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,376
There it is.

7
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:43,886
Your baby.

8
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:51,857
I'll get it.

9
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:01,996
Hello?

10
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,538
Hello?

11
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,156
You should come home.

12
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,294
Home?

13
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,534
I don't know if now's such a good time.

14
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,937
It's a very bad time,
but you should come.

15
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,377
There is a way to be good again, Amir.

16
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,770
Amir jan.

17
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,894
Hassan! Hassan!

18
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:12,485
Omar! Omar! Omar!

19
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,663
Omar!

20
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,258
Amir.

21
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,442
Amir jan.

22
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,180
Baba.

23
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:14,840
Ali.

24
00:45:11,607 --> 00:45:12,767
Ali.

25
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:21,796
A pack of those.

26
00:53:25,133 --> 00:53:27,226
-Is that your car?
-Yeah.

27
00:53:31,373 --> 00:53:33,238
-Beautiful car.
-Thanks.

28
00:53:45,487 --> 00:53:47,853
Richard Hidalgo.

29
00:53:53,929 --> 00:53:56,022
Erin Hill.

30
00:54:01,203 --> 00:54:03,501
Denise Hawking.

31
00:54:07,676 --> 00:54:10,304
Damon Hooper.

32
00:54:15,617 --> 00:54:17,915
June Kitagawa.

33
00:54:28,964 --> 00:54:31,296
-Hi.
-Hello.

34
00:54:32,067 --> 00:54:34,968
-Tonight I'm very happy.
-Well, that's good.

35
00:54:35,437 --> 00:54:38,634
-Tonight I drink with my son.
-Hi.

36
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,538
How are you, my friend?
Let's have a drink with us.

37
00:54:41,643 --> 00:54:43,508
-What you like to drink?
-Scotch.

38
00:54:43,612 --> 00:54:46,240
-Three Scotch, please.
-I'll have a beer instead. Thanks.

39
00:54:46,348 --> 00:54:48,111
-Budweiser?
-Sure.

40
00:54:48,216 --> 00:54:49,478
Please.

41
00:54:52,688 --> 00:54:55,452
My son, the college graduate.

42
00:54:56,124 --> 00:54:59,457
-It's just community college.
-It's college.

43
00:55:00,629 --> 00:55:03,029
And someday, Dr. Amir!

44
00:55:04,466 --> 00:55:06,957
-You know I want to write.
-Write?

45
00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:09,303
I don't want to be a doctor.

46
00:55:10,772 --> 00:55:11,966
Cheers.

47
00:55:17,479 --> 00:55:19,003
One more, sir.

48
00:55:19,915 --> 00:55:22,509
So instead of being doctor
and saving lives,

49
00:55:22,617 --> 00:55:24,278
he wants make up stories.

50
00:55:41,103 --> 00:55:43,833
Beautiful! Beautiful shot!
You see that shot?

51
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,731
A pitcher of beer for gentlemen, please.

52
00:55:48,777 --> 00:55:51,610
Cheers. My son,
he graduates college today.

53
00:55:51,713 --> 00:55:54,045
-Way to go, man. Congratulations.
-Thank you.

54
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:57,277
Fuck the Russia!

55
00:55:58,019 --> 00:56:00,817
-Fuck the Russia!
-Fuck Russia.

56
00:56:17,572 --> 00:56:20,302
-Four, so that's $6.
-Okay.

57
00:56:30,185 --> 00:56:31,516
Amir jan.

58
00:57:52,667 --> 00:57:54,032
A story.

59
00:58:06,481 --> 00:58:09,279
-How much?
-$160.

60
00:58:09,384 --> 00:58:10,749
Not bad.

61
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:14,248
-You want a Coke?
-Sure. Be careful.

62
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:16,182
Of what?

63
00:58:27,002 --> 00:58:28,264
I won't.

64
00:58:36,144 --> 00:58:39,375
-Hi.
-Hi.

65
00:58:39,481 --> 00:58:42,780
-Is General Sahib here today?
-Yeah, he went that way.

66
00:58:44,152 --> 00:58:47,315
Will you tell him that I stopped by
to pay my respects?

67
00:58:47,422 --> 00:58:49,287
I will.

68
00:58:49,391 --> 00:58:52,792
Thank you. Oh, and my name's Amir.

69
00:58:52,894 --> 00:58:57,058
In case you need to know,
so you can tell him that I stopped by.

70
00:58:57,165 --> 00:58:58,962
To pay my respects.

71
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:05,595
-I'll go now. Sorry to disturb you.
-Oh, no, no, you didn't.

72
00:59:07,275 --> 00:59:08,765
Good.

73
00:59:11,746 --> 00:59:13,771
Can I ask what you're reading?

74
00:59:15,417 --> 00:59:17,044
Have you read it?

75
00:59:17,786 --> 00:59:19,413
It's a sad story.

76
00:59:20,855 --> 00:59:22,447
I heard you write.

77
00:59:25,827 --> 00:59:28,387
Would you like to read
one of my stories?

78
00:59:31,299 --> 00:59:32,698
I'd like that.

79
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:36,732
Great.

80
01:00:16,144 --> 01:00:18,908
-How much for this?
-$5.

81
01:00:19,614 --> 01:00:22,674
-I'll give you three.
-Okay.

82
01:00:23,485 --> 01:00:24,918
Thank you.

83
01:00:25,771 --> 01:00:28,262
-You're not much of a haggler.
-I know.

84
01:00:29,742 --> 01:00:31,767
I brought you something.

85
01:00:33,412 --> 01:00:35,972
-You remembered.
-Of course.

86
01:01:26,999 --> 01:01:29,365
-For your granddaughter?
-My granddaughter.

87
01:01:29,468 --> 01:01:31,868
-lmpossible.
-Thank you very much.

88
01:01:32,404 --> 01:01:33,769
Here you go. Thank You.

89
01:01:33,873 --> 01:01:35,966
-Have a good day.
-You're welcome.

90
01:01:40,346 --> 01:01:41,540
Amir.

91
01:01:42,815 --> 01:01:44,248
What's wrong?

92
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:46,244
Nothing.

93
01:01:47,586 --> 01:01:49,053
The General?

94
01:01:53,058 --> 01:01:54,423
You okay?

95
01:01:59,431 --> 01:02:00,591
You all right?

96
01:02:00,699 --> 01:02:01,996
Have you been coughing?

97
01:02:02,368 --> 01:02:03,335
Yes.

98
01:02:04,837 --> 01:02:06,327
Where are you from?

99
01:02:06,438 --> 01:02:09,930
I grew up in Michigan.
Came out here for medical school.

100
01:02:10,042 --> 01:02:12,738
Once you get used to
that California sunshine...

101
01:02:12,845 --> 01:02:15,109
-But your family?
-My family.

102
01:02:15,214 --> 01:02:17,375
We're originally from Russia.

103
01:02:21,053 --> 01:02:22,247
I'm sorry.

104
01:02:40,873 --> 01:02:43,307
-How are you feeling?
-The same.

105
01:02:44,577 --> 01:02:46,477
We have your results back.

106
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:52,984
Wait outside for me.

107
01:03:11,904 --> 01:03:14,964
"The citizens of Kabul
were skeletons now,

108
01:03:15,074 --> 01:03:17,702
"skeletons selling naswar
in the night market,

109
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:20,438
"skeletons drinking cups of strong tea,

110
01:03:21,146 --> 01:03:23,671
"skeletons playing cards
in the moonlight.

111
01:03:25,017 --> 01:03:29,181
"They greeted me as I passed,
teeth clacking together in their jaws.

112
01:03:30,923 --> 01:03:33,517
"'Salaam, brother,' they said.

113
01:03:35,294 --> 01:03:36,818
"'Welcome home."'

114
01:03:43,636 --> 01:03:45,331
It's sort of a work in progress.

115
01:03:47,439 --> 01:03:49,839
It's called The Sultans of Kabul.

116
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:52,341
Good title.

117
01:03:54,213 --> 01:03:55,578
Keep going.

118
01:03:57,149 --> 01:03:58,582
That's the end.

119
01:03:59,818 --> 01:04:01,547
That's not an ending.

120
01:04:02,888 --> 01:04:05,083
It's my story.

121
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:07,249
I get to end it how I want.

122
01:04:17,569 --> 01:04:19,764
It's not Dr. Amani's decision.

123
01:05:43,021 --> 01:05:44,613
I'm really sorry.

124
01:05:47,793 --> 01:05:51,422
You better go back inside
or your father will come after me.

125
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,165
Your story made me cry.

126
01:05:59,938 --> 01:06:01,303
You read it?

127
01:06:03,609 --> 01:06:04,940
Our secret?

128
01:06:07,112 --> 01:06:08,170
Yeah.

129
01:06:09,815 --> 01:06:11,112
Our secret.

130
01:06:43,615 --> 01:06:45,879
Can I do anything else for you?

131
01:06:52,024 --> 01:06:54,584
Then I wonder
if you'd do something for me.

132
01:08:06,598 --> 01:08:08,964
Okay. Good luck.

133
01:08:15,073 --> 01:08:16,062
Hello?

134
01:08:22,581 --> 01:08:24,811
-About what?
-About what?

135
01:08:28,253 --> 01:08:30,050
Okay. Okay. I'm on my way.

136
01:09:00,452 --> 01:09:02,477
You do want to get married?

137
01:09:03,755 --> 01:09:06,246
-To me, I mean.
-Of course I do.

138
01:09:08,627 --> 01:09:11,460
It's just... I want to tell you something,

139
01:09:12,664 --> 01:09:14,655
something you need to know.

140
01:09:16,034 --> 01:09:18,195
I don't want us to start with secrets.

141
01:09:21,773 --> 01:09:24,207
We lived in Virginia
before we came here.

142
01:09:24,309 --> 01:09:25,936
We left because

143
01:09:27,579 --> 01:09:29,877
I ran away with an Afghan man.

144
01:09:30,649 --> 01:09:33,709
I was 18.
I guess I thought I was being rebellious.

145
01:09:34,619 --> 01:09:37,053
We lived together for almost a month.

146
01:09:38,323 --> 01:09:41,121
All the Afghans in Virginia
were talking about it.

147
01:09:43,362 --> 01:09:44,624
My father eventually found us.

148
01:09:44,730 --> 01:09:48,598
He showed up at the door
and he made me come home.

149
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:52,192
I was hysterical,
and I told him I hated him.

150
01:09:55,374 --> 01:09:58,036
We moved out to California
a few weeks later.

151
01:09:58,643 --> 01:10:02,135
I didn't talk to my father
for a very long time. And now...

152
01:10:03,615 --> 01:10:06,550
Now I feel like he's the reason
why I'm here.

153
01:10:09,121 --> 01:10:11,385
Does what I told you bother you?

154
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,288
A little.

155
01:10:15,827 --> 01:10:18,318
Does it bother you enough
to change your mind?

156
01:10:19,464 --> 01:10:20,726
No.

157
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:23,896
Not even close.

158
01:10:26,471 --> 01:10:28,496
I'd marry you tonight if I could.

159
01:11:58,363 --> 01:11:59,830
What do you see?

160
01:12:01,733 --> 01:12:03,462
The rest of my life.

161
01:12:58,823 --> 01:13:02,486
-They're so funny.
-They were crazy.

162
01:13:04,863 --> 01:13:06,421
That's a funny picture.

163
01:13:07,999 --> 01:13:09,296
They're so cute.

164
01:13:10,502 --> 01:13:13,232
-Amir jan?
-Right here, Baba.

165
01:15:02,447 --> 01:15:04,210
It will not be easy.

166
01:15:05,216 --> 01:15:07,446
But you must come, Amir.

167
01:15:10,288 --> 01:15:11,312
You're a good man.

168
01:15:32,043 --> 01:15:33,374
You all right?

169
01:15:34,913 --> 01:15:36,574
I have to go to Pakistan.

170
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:39,511
Pakistan?

171
01:15:40,318 --> 01:15:42,218
Rahim Khan is very sick.

172
01:15:42,754 --> 01:15:45,086
Your father's friend?

173
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:46,987
Is it safe right now?

174
01:15:49,327 --> 01:15:51,192
What about the book tour?

175
01:15:53,665 --> 01:15:56,566
There wouldn't be any books
if not for Rahim Khan.

176
01:16:07,212 --> 01:16:09,373
It's terrible what's happening
in your country.

177
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:12,314
Afghani people and Pakistani people,
they are like brothers.

178
01:16:12,417 --> 01:16:14,112
Muslim have to help Muslim.

179
01:16:15,453 --> 01:16:18,217
They call this area Afghan Town.

180
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:21,656
Sometimes it feels like Peshawar
is a suburb of Kabul.

181
01:16:28,366 --> 01:16:29,833
This way.

182
01:16:50,789 --> 01:16:52,313
Amir jan.

183
01:16:54,859 --> 01:16:56,292
Amir jan.

184
01:18:10,635 --> 01:18:14,662
"For Rahim Khan,
who listened to my stories

185
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,835
"before I knew how to write them."

186
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:27,884
This is a great honor, Amir.

187
01:18:34,926 --> 01:18:36,791
Let me take you home with me.

188
01:18:37,629 --> 01:18:39,790
I can find you a good doctor.

189
01:18:40,498 --> 01:18:42,989
They're coming up with new treatments
all the time.

190
01:18:45,537 --> 01:18:47,198
Amir, Amir, Amir.

191
01:18:49,607 --> 01:18:52,735
I see America has infused you
with her optimism.

192
01:18:54,012 --> 01:18:57,345
But there is such a thing as God's will.

193
01:19:05,056 --> 01:19:08,116
I didn't bring you here
to complain about my health.

194
01:19:09,661 --> 01:19:14,064
Forgive me, Amir jan.
Forgive me for what I have to tell you.

195
01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:21,062
Hassan is dead.

196
01:19:28,713 --> 01:19:29,771
How?

197
01:19:31,382 --> 01:19:34,647
You know I watched over
your father's house after you left.

198
01:19:36,454 --> 01:19:40,049
But none of the caretakers I hired
lasted more than a year.

199
01:19:41,092 --> 01:19:43,754
Some were dishonest, some lazy.

200
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:49,231
So a few years ago I went to Hazarajat

201
01:19:51,169 --> 01:19:53,865
and brought Hassan
and his family home with me.

202
01:19:56,474 --> 01:20:00,467
His wife, Farzana, and his son, Sohrab.

203
01:20:06,884 --> 01:20:08,943
It was so good to have them there.

204
01:20:10,688 --> 01:20:13,555
Hassan kept the house
from falling apart.

205
01:20:13,891 --> 01:20:16,485
And Farzana cooked the meals.

206
01:20:21,633 --> 01:20:24,067
But when my health began to fail,

207
01:20:24,168 --> 01:20:28,229
well, there isn't a hospital in
Afghanistan that can help me,

208
01:20:28,339 --> 01:20:29,738
so I came here.

209
01:20:31,843 --> 01:20:35,609
A few weeks after I left,
the Taliban came to the house.

210
01:20:35,713 --> 01:20:39,513
Hassan told them that he was looking
after the house for me, but...

211
01:20:40,718 --> 01:20:44,950
They said that he was a liar and a thief
like all the other Hazaras.

212
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:48,253
And they ordered him to leave
with his family by nightfall.

213
01:20:53,231 --> 01:20:57,793
So they took him to the street
and ordered him to kneel

214
01:21:00,038 --> 01:21:02,768
and shot him in the back of the head.

215
01:21:04,842 --> 01:21:08,278
Farzana came screaming
and attacked them and...

216
01:21:10,682 --> 01:21:12,274
They shot her, too.

217
01:21:14,552 --> 01:21:15,849
And the boy?

218
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:19,848
Sohrab?

219
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:23,625
He is in an orphanage

220
01:21:25,863 --> 01:21:27,592
in Karteh Seh.

221
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:32,934
Hassan sent this to me a week
before he died.

222
01:21:35,306 --> 01:21:36,705
It's for you.

223
01:21:42,013 --> 01:21:44,311
He taught himself to read and write.

224
01:21:46,384 --> 01:21:50,081
He didn't want to send you a letter
until he could do it properly.

225
01:21:57,095 --> 01:21:58,289
Amir,

226
01:22:00,565 --> 01:22:02,760
you need to go back to Kabul.

227
01:22:03,768 --> 01:22:06,464
I've arranged for a driver.
He's a good man.

228
01:22:06,571 --> 01:22:08,232
I can't go back to Kabul.

229
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:12,601
Can't you pay someone here to go?
I'll pay for it if it's a matter of money.

230
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:14,405
It's not about money.

231
01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:18,141
You are a storyteller.

232
01:22:18,916 --> 01:22:21,476
Some part of you
has always known this story.

233
01:22:23,588 --> 01:22:26,455
Ali's first wife was from Jaghori.

234
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:30,419
What does that
have to do with anything?

235
01:22:30,795 --> 01:22:34,060
After five years she left him childless,

236
01:22:35,166 --> 01:22:37,361
and married a man from Khost.

237
01:22:39,470 --> 01:22:41,870
She bore that man three daughters.

238
01:22:43,508 --> 01:22:46,443
Do you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

239
01:22:47,512 --> 01:22:49,571
Ali was sterile.

240
01:22:51,082 --> 01:22:52,515
But he had Hassan.

241
01:22:52,617 --> 01:22:55,984
He raised Hassan. He didn't father him.

242
01:22:57,889 --> 01:23:02,690
Your father loved you both
because you were both his sons,

243
01:23:02,794 --> 01:23:05,262
-and Sohrab...
-No.

244
01:23:35,359 --> 01:23:38,089
-He lied to me.
-He lied to both of you.

245
01:23:38,963 --> 01:23:42,091
And now there is a way
to be good again.

246
01:24:23,674 --> 01:24:26,643
"ln the name of God,
the merciful, the compassionate,

247
01:24:26,744 --> 01:24:30,043
"Amir agha, with my deepest respects.

248
01:24:30,781 --> 01:24:33,773
"My wife and son and l
pray this letter finds you in fine health,

249
01:24:33,885 --> 01:24:36,251
"and in the light of God's good graces.

250
01:24:36,354 --> 01:24:38,948
"I'm hopeful that one day I will hold
one of your letters in my hands

251
01:24:39,056 --> 01:24:41,524
"and read of your life in America.

252
01:24:41,626 --> 01:24:45,323
"l am trying to learn English.
It's such a tricky language.

253
01:24:45,429 --> 01:24:48,660
"But one day, agha. I miss your stories.

254
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:52,769
"I've included a picture of me
and my son, Sohrab.

255
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:54,633
"He's a good boy.

256
01:24:54,739 --> 01:24:56,536
"Rahim Khan and l
taught him how to read and write,

257
01:24:56,641 --> 01:24:59,474
"so he doesn't grow up
stupid like his father.

258
01:24:59,577 --> 01:25:02,740
"And can he shoot
with that slingshot you gave me!

259
01:25:04,815 --> 01:25:08,046
"But I fear for him, Amir agha.

260
01:25:08,152 --> 01:25:10,712
"The Afghanistan of our youth
is long dead.

261
01:25:10,821 --> 01:25:15,758
"Kindness is gone from the land,
and you cannot escape the killings.

262
01:25:15,860 --> 01:25:17,953
"Always the killings.

274
01:25:52,396 --> 01:25:53,954
"Hassan. "

275
01:26:06,377 --> 01:26:07,503
Hello?

276
01:26:08,379 --> 01:26:09,471
Hi.

277
01:26:10,982 --> 01:26:13,450
-Did I wake you up?
-No.

278
01:26:14,819 --> 01:26:16,343
You all right?

279
01:26:17,488 --> 01:26:19,422
I have to tell you a story.

280
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:23,959
What's his name?

281
01:26:49,687 --> 01:26:51,552
Stop playing with it.

282
01:26:55,793 --> 01:27:00,093
You know what the Taliban will do to
you if they see you are clean-shaven?

283
01:27:56,053 --> 01:27:58,248
So what brings you back
to Afghanistan?

284
01:27:58,355 --> 01:28:01,415
Come to sell off your father's land,
pocket the money?

285
01:28:02,526 --> 01:28:04,255
I'm not here to sell anything.

286
01:28:05,229 --> 01:28:07,356
I'm going to Kabul to find a boy.

287
01:28:08,632 --> 01:28:10,099
A boy?

288
01:28:18,609 --> 01:28:20,133
This boy?

289
01:28:20,244 --> 01:28:22,303
This Hazara boy?

290
01:28:22,413 --> 01:28:23,812
Yeah.

291
01:28:25,082 --> 01:28:26,982
What he means to you?

292
01:28:29,386 --> 01:28:33,152
His father meant a lot to me.
He's the man in the photo.

293
01:28:34,592 --> 01:28:36,253
He's dead now.

294
01:28:37,528 --> 01:28:39,519
It was a friend of yours?

295
01:28:41,198 --> 01:28:42,722
He was my brother.

296
01:28:53,844 --> 01:28:57,336
You've always been a tourist here.
You just didn't know it.

297
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:05,649
-What happened to the trees?
-The Russians chopped them down.

298
01:29:16,333 --> 01:29:18,301
You know what they're doing?

299
01:29:20,037 --> 01:29:21,527
He's selling his leg?

300
01:29:22,273 --> 01:29:24,400
He can get good money for it.

301
01:29:24,508 --> 01:29:26,908
Feed your kids for a couple of weeks.

302
01:29:40,591 --> 01:29:42,616
-What's that smell?
-Diesel.

303
01:29:44,195 --> 01:29:47,460
The power's always going off
so people use generators.

304
01:34:34,985 --> 01:34:36,577
Pull over here.

305
01:35:30,641 --> 01:35:32,734
Nothing that you remember
has survived.

306
01:49:45,528 --> 01:49:46,722
Sohrab?

307
01:49:56,439 --> 01:49:57,633
Sohrab?

308
01:50:19,429 --> 01:50:20,487
Sohrab?

309
01:50:38,581 --> 01:50:39,707
Sohrab?

310
01:54:51,734 --> 01:54:53,861
-Missed you.
-Missed you, too.

311
01:55:39,014 --> 01:55:40,504
You don't look so bad.

312
01:55:44,186 --> 01:55:46,154
I don't think he's looked at me once.

313
01:55:48,290 --> 01:55:49,689
Give him time.

314
01:56:02,872 --> 01:56:04,134
Amir jan.

315
01:56:32,301 --> 01:56:34,496
-Amir?
-It's all right.

316
01:56:40,676 --> 01:56:42,439
You see, General Sahib,

317
01:56:43,512 --> 01:56:46,140
my father slept with his servant's wife.

318
01:56:47,583 --> 01:56:50,074
And she bore him a son named Hassan.

319
01:56:52,021 --> 01:56:53,579
Hassan is dead now.

320
01:56:54,390 --> 01:56:57,791
That boy sleeping in the other room
is Hassan's son.

321
01:56:59,595 --> 01:57:01,062
He's my nephew.

322
01:57:02,164 --> 01:57:04,758
That's what you tell people
when they ask.

323
01:57:06,802 --> 01:57:09,100
And one more thing, General Sahib.

324
01:57:10,072 --> 01:57:14,168
You will never again refer to him
as "a Hazara boy" in my presence.

325
01:57:14,844 --> 01:57:18,974
He has a name, and it's Sohrab.

326
01:57:45,140 --> 01:57:46,732
-lt felt so real.
-Thank you.
