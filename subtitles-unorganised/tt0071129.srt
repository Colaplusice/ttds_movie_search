1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:05,293
How are you?
- And how are you?

2
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:07,199
I'm fine, I go to school.

3
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:12,402
Guess where we're taKing you today?

4
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:13,976
To eat "passatelli" at the farm.

5
00:00:15,614 --> 00:00:17,377
What do you thinK of that?

6
00:00:17,983 --> 00:00:20,349
LooK, Dad's here too.
He's a lovely lad!

7
00:00:21,787 --> 00:00:23,948
Give Dad a Kiss.

8
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:27,959
How's he?
- He's normal.

9
00:00:28,794 --> 00:00:31,024
He's grown, hasn't he?
He's in the fifth grade.

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,425
And he got dead drunK
the other night.

11
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:38,629
How are you Keeping?
- I'm much better.

12
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:43,098
Mamma, the pastries!
Uncle, Mamma brought you pastries.

13
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:46,742
We'll be bacK before evening.

14
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:50,143
Have a smoKe on me.

15
00:00:56,989 --> 00:00:58,786
Is Father Pazzaglia still alive?

16
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:02,359
He's been dead ten years now.

17
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:04,654
He's been gone quite a time!

18
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,492
He was alive last year.
- That was Father Amadeo.

19
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:12,836
Is he dead as well?
- No, he's alive.

20
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,201
Exactly, that's what I was saying.

21
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:20,206
I saw him last year, walKing
along with a bunch of flowers.

22
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:22,878
I wonder where he was going?

23
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:29,418
Teo was a bright lad
when he was eight.

24
00:01:30,856 --> 00:01:32,721
I don't want
to offend you, Aurelio,

25
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:35,452
but Teo was smarter than you
at school.

26
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,996
I grant you that.
That's quite true.

27
00:01:39,198 --> 00:01:41,598
He still is, even now.

28
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,964
Do you liKe being with us, Teo?

29
00:01:46,405 --> 00:01:49,602
Uncle, the sea's over there.
It's liKe a blue streaK.

30
00:01:51,143 --> 00:01:53,270
Dad, can I drive the horse?
- No!

31
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:57,182
What can I do just sitting here,
then? Let me drive it!

32
00:01:57,416 --> 00:02:00,647
That'll be the first time a horse
was driven by a mule!

33
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:06,118
That's a shorter road.

34
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:10,291
An awful road, full of potholes,
enough to taKe this carriage.

35
00:02:10,996 --> 00:02:12,588
Is something wrong?

36
00:02:18,337 --> 00:02:21,238
Why do you carry those
in your pocKet?

37
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:25,966
These stones!

38
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,077
Aren't they heavy?
- They're beautiful, stones are.

39
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:39,217
Stop the carriage!

40
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,727
Teo needs to taKe a leaK!

41
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,994
If he has to...

42
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,992
Watch how you get down.

43
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:54,231
You too?

44
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,537
Don't be long, Grandpa,
I'm hungry.

45
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,938
My father's father used to say:

46
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,314
To be fit as a fiddle,
you have to piddle!

47
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,278
To be fit as a frog,
pee often liKe a dog.

48
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,122
How green!
How beautiful, Teo...

49
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:19,522
How old's the mare?
- Three years and two months.

50
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,257
She's only got one vice,
she can't stand train whistles.

51
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:27,095
When I'm at the station stand,
it's really a job to hold her!

52
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:32,443
What'll you give her to eat today?
- Cappelletti (pasta).

53
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:34,670
You forgot to unbutton your fly!

54
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,404
Uncle pissed in his pants!

55
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:41,513
They said he was normal!

56
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,382
You didn't undo your fly!

57
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,052
He forgot.

58
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,924
It's really true.

59
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,290
The sea looKs liKe a blue streaK.

60
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,695
You pissed in your pants!
- Shut up!

61
00:03:56,702 --> 00:03:58,329
He didn't open the shop!

62
00:03:59,705 --> 00:04:01,935
It doesn't matter,
you can change at the farm.

63
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,881
Come here, or I'll throw myself
under the wheels!

64
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,108
Sit down, you criminal!

65
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,278
Shall we move on?

66
00:04:26,865 --> 00:04:29,163
Ah, that was a fine meal!

67
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:32,426
You all go and see the spring.

68
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:36,597
My son Teo and I will stay here
and have another glass of wine.

69
00:04:37,142 --> 00:04:39,804
Fine, but just one and no more.

70
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:43,610
Know what I'll do?
I'll have a nap.

71
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:48,649
Good. It won't do you any harm
here in the shade.

72
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:51,816
The eggs's lovely, isn't it, Teo?

73
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:57,427
Me too. When I see an egg,
I could looK at it for hours.

74
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:01,963
I asK myself how Nature manages
to maKe things so perfect.

75
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:06,435
God made Nature,
not an ignorant lout liKe you!

76
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:10,337
Oh, don't bust my chops!
See you later here.

77
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:15,480
I'm relying on you, Dad. Menghino,
how far away is this spring?

78
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,523
Uncle, looK, I'm hypnotizing it.

79
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:39,132
Oliva, there's a toad!
It looKs liKe Father Balosa!

80
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:50,178
What's it liKe?
- Fantastic!

81
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,510
It won't give you a hangover.
We'll put it here.

82
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,186
Throw that stone away!

83
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,854
You naughty little boy!

84
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:10,901
I Know what your name is,
you delinquent!

85
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:19,107
Dad, Uncle Teo's up a tree!

86
00:06:20,245 --> 00:06:23,544
What's that? What's he shouting?
- I can't understand.

87
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:26,809
Uncle Teo's up a tree!

88
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:32,848
I want a woman!

89
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,325
I want a woman!

90
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,300
But where am I going
to get you a woman, my boy?

91
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:49,201
Uncle's up there.

92
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,274
I want a woman!

93
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:54,873
There he is, up there!

94
00:06:57,883 --> 00:07:00,408
Come down, Teo,
you'll hurt yourself.

95
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,745
QuicKly, get a ladder!

96
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:06,723
Is this how you Keep an eye on him?
How did he get up there?

97
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:11,386
I'll go up.
- I'll hammer you into the ground.

98
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:19,728
How did he get up there?
If he falls he'll breaK every bone.

99
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:22,805
You go indoors and stop
playing the actress.

100
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:25,809
How did he do it?

101
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,446
We were having a drinK,
and liKe a shot...

102
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:31,047
He was away and up there
liKe a cat.

103
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,486
What're you doing?
Throwing stones at your old dad!

104
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,746
That's enough, now!

105
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:43,418
Now, now! Don't you do the same!

106
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,626
Come down, Teo,
your brother's angry.

107
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:49,232
Come down, now!

108
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:52,733
I WANT A WOMAN!!!

109
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:58,776
It's quite a normal urge. He's 42!
- Yes, but he'll fall down.

110
00:07:58,977 --> 00:08:01,673
When I was 42... I'll tell you!

111
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:07,075
Now, that's enough, Teo!

112
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:09,653
Climb down, Teo!

113
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:14,018
Good shot, Uncle,
right on his head!

114
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:19,626
Right on the target.

115
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:26,626
Now, I'll come up,
but don't throw anything at me!

116
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:29,670
We'll taKe some birds home.

117
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:33,870
Do you want to Kill us all?
- Now, I'm coming up.

118
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,977
Yes sirree! If you throw
one at me, you'll hear about it!

119
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:48,658
What a shot! Murderer! I hope
somebody KicKs you in the nuts!

120
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,066
Christ, what'll I do now?
JerK off?

121
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,907
I'm an asshole, a stupid asshole.

122
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:08,070
Well, let's all go home!

123
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,741
Driver, hitch up the horse,
we're going home!

124
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:18,686
Are you going to leave him up there?
- Yes! Hitch up the horse. Let's go!

125
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:22,018
As you wish.
- Dad! Titta!

126
00:09:22,227 --> 00:09:24,752
Call your mother!
Where's your mother?

127
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:27,865
Leaving him there?
- He's all right up there.

128
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,363
Let's go! I want to go home.

129
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:32,298
But he's my son!
Aurelio, listen to me.

130
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:36,167
I want a woman!
- Miranda!

131
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,367
Teo, we're going. Come down!

132
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:43,843
We're just pretending.

133
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,583
Listen, Aurelio...
Send me up there. He'll come down.

134
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,890
Everyone in the carriage!

135
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,865
We're leaving right away. Get in.

136
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:08,028
Teo, what're you doing? Staying
there? We're going now. It's late.

137
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,540
It's getting darK.
Who'll taKe you bacK?

138
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:16,345
You going to stay up there?
All right, then, ciao!

139
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:27,251
Come down!

140
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:38,359
Teo, Holy Mother of God!
Are you going to come down?

141
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,528
We're leaving!

142
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:46,534
Good-bye, Uncle!

143
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:09,558
He'll Kill the lot of us, today.

144
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:15,001
Come on, let's have you all out!
Get out, now! No questions!

145
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,072
What're you crying about?

146
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:21,310
Now, you drive to the hospital
and call the attendants.

147
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:23,606
And come bacK right away,
or I'll throw myself down the well!

148
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,845
What're you crying about?
It's a big laugh, it's just comic!

149
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:48,696
Listen to him, Miranda.
Poor lad.

150
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,204
Do you feel better?

151
00:11:56,181 --> 00:12:00,641
I want a woman!

152
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:14,129
I can't stand any more!

153
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:16,857
MaKe him shut up!
I've had enough!

154
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:19,434
Dad... Dad...
- What do you want?

155
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,333
Shall I go and call Volpina?

156
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:29,473
LooK, Dad.

157
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,682
Mamma, they've arrived.

158
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,183
Good evening, Doctor.
- What's happened?

159
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:41,520
He's up the tree.
- Nice place. Fresh air. All yours?

160
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:43,557
It's only an old farm.

161
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,524
He's been up there for five hours.

162
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:51,293
You can't see him now,
because of the foliage.

163
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:53,494
What have you done to him?
- Nothing.

164
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:56,299
He's been shouting
and throwing stones.

165
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:58,635
I hope he won't always be liKe
this... his whole life, Doctor.

166
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,539
A dwarf nun!

167
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:07,374
Lt'll be bad for him
and worse for us.

168
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:09,052
Keep cool, she'll attend to things.

169
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,213
Were you getting a bit of air?

170
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,051
Is she going up?

171
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:21,132
Come down! I'm not going
to play these damn silly games!

172
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:28,271
Jesus, just looK at that!
She's got him to come down!

173
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:33,236
She's got him down
and he's quite happy.

174
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:38,673
Teo, Teo...

175
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,083
Here he is.

176
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:45,053
So, have you been up
to your tricKs again, have you?

177
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,555
What were you doing up there?

178
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,557
Counting how many stones
fig trees grow in this season.

179
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:51,956
TaKe him home.

180
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,500
Some days he's normal, some days
he isn't... just liKe all of us.

181
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:03,340
Ciao, Uncle!
- Titta, taKe care.

182
00:14:09,047 --> 00:14:11,277
You can see Gigino's place
from up there.

183
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:14,285
It's a long time since
I saw him.

184
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:22,525
Between 11 o'clocK and midnight,
in Caghetta's boat.

185
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:28,224
It's thirty stories high
and has sixteen smoKestacKs.

186
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:31,300
ThinK what a pirate could do
with a ship liKe that!

187
00:15:00,865 --> 00:15:03,197
Where's "Ronald Coleman"?
I don't see him.

188
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,793
Gradisca! Hurray for Gradisca!

189
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:12,837
Hello, sister.
- Your steamboat. Climb aboard!

190
00:15:18,683 --> 00:15:21,481
Where're all these people going?

191
00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:26,851
Where're they going with hearts
all pounding? Where're they going?

192
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:32,522
Today is a very important day for
our country, for our fatherland...

193
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,596
Come on, we're off!

194
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,030
If you drop me,
you'll have to pay for it all.

195
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:44,403
I'd liKe to tell you, but I can't
because it's all still in the air.

196
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:47,970
Where're these people going?

197
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:06,693
How far out will it be?
- Eight Kilometers.

198
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:10,629
But thanKs to Galileo, it will
seem liKe 400 meters to us.

199
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:13,395
Marvelous! Lt'll seem liKe
it's coming straight at us.

200
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:31,881
Mr. Lawyer, how much will it weigh?

201
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:37,053
About two and a half times
the weight of the Grand Hotel.

202
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:39,723
Plus the Arch of Augustus!

203
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:43,392
"Go thou, Queen of the Sea

204
00:16:43,601 --> 00:16:47,264
"Thou passeth and thy destiny

205
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:50,305
"I shall follow in the waves

206
00:16:50,508 --> 00:16:55,275
"Watching the glistening waKe..."

207
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,210
Get closer to your mother,
and you move nearer to your son.

208
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,745
SucK me off! The water's
really freezing!

209
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:08,282
My nuts has shriveled to the size
of two dried beans.

210
00:17:10,228 --> 00:17:12,856
You swam out?
- Sure!

211
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:15,624
I did the Australian crawl.

212
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:25,741
"I want to dance with you

213
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,105
"All night liKe this..."

214
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:35,877
The third day I went there
with my boat, whistled as usual

215
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,920
and out came the dolphin.

216
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,752
It looKed at me
and said "mamma"!

217
00:17:43,294 --> 00:17:45,353
What a load of bull!

218
00:17:45,563 --> 00:17:47,963
Dolphins are intelligent,
my dentist told me so.

219
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:53,433
LooK how many there are.

220
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,664
Millions and millions
and millions of stars.

221
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,609
Jesus Christ, you guys!
I wonder

222
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:02,976
how the whole lot
stays up there in place?

223
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:08,075
It's pretty simple for us.

224
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:11,650
If we have to build a house,
so many bricKs, so much lime...

225
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,757
But up there, Sweet Jesus!
Where do you put the foundations?

226
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,757
They aren't just confetti,
you Know!

227
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,429
Are you asleep? Answer me!

228
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:26,729
Are you cold? Want my jacKet?
Come on, taKe my jacKet.

229
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:31,037
Put it round your shoulders or
you'll get a chill and complain.

230
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:35,037
We've still a long time to wait,
haven't we? It's one o'clocK.

231
00:18:35,246 --> 00:18:37,510
How would I Know? They said
it'd be around midnight.

232
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:39,479
Even if it's late, it's coming
from America, you Know.

233
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:42,885
Go fucK yourselves, all of you!

234
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:44,952
He's a friend...

235
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:51,260
He sent you best wishes.

236
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:57,925
Every time I was full of hope,
but it never came to anything.

237
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:00,998
And now...

238
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,539
Know how old I am?
- Fifty-two?

239
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,903
I'm not ashamed to tell the truth.

240
00:19:07,078 --> 00:19:11,242
In fact, I always add
a few years on. I'm thirty.

241
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:14,007
That's surprising, my darling.
- I haven't given up hope.

242
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:16,220
I thought you were seventeen age.

243
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:21,124
I want one of those long encounters
that last a lifetime.

244
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:26,730
I want a family, children,
a husband

245
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:32,062
to chat with in the evening
at supper, maybe,

246
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,205
and to maKe love with now and then,
because that's important too.

247
00:19:36,307 --> 00:19:38,775
But affection is perhaps
even more necessary than love.

248
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,672
I'm so full of affection.

249
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:47,014
But who can I lavish it on,
who wants it?

250
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:50,653
Why are you crying? LooK at
the silly girl, she's crying!

251
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:55,349
The girl is delicate
and sensitive, oh yes!

252
00:19:56,327 --> 00:20:01,230
She's right! Men are all the same!
- Don't cry, my darling!

253
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,156
Here it is!
- Dad, Dad!

254
00:20:28,726 --> 00:20:31,286
The Rex! The Rex!

255
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:36,756
Hurray for the Rex! The greatest
thing the regime has built!

256
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:44,974
As the representative of the Podesta,
I wish you a safe journey!

257
00:20:45,176 --> 00:20:46,700
Long live Italy!

258
00:20:47,178 --> 00:20:50,579
What's it liKe?
What's it liKe?

259
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,053
Just looK at this!

260
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:53,470
Can't see a darned thing!

261
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,271
I'll Keep to the wall.

262
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:03,218
The last fog liKe this was in '22.

263
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,162
Careful now, stop.
There's a man here!

264
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:19,569
Well, damn it all.

265
00:22:23,107 --> 00:22:27,635
Gina! Gina!

266
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:36,916
Where am I?
I don't seem to be anywhere.

267
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:46,355
If death is liKe this,
I don't thinK much of it.

268
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:54,529
Everything's gone.
People, trees, birds, wine...

269
00:22:57,608 --> 00:22:58,836
Up yours!

270
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:12,783
Dino, I can't even find
my house. Where am I?

271
00:23:13,357 --> 00:23:16,258
You are in front of your house.

272
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:17,655
It's there...

273
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:33,408
Where're you going in all this fog?
- To school. Ciao, Grandpa.

274
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:36,777
Just thinK of that.

275
00:24:55,726 --> 00:24:58,889
I was in Norway. Two women...

276
00:24:59,864 --> 00:25:03,960
beautiful, huge, Norwegians!

277
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:06,863
Beans, olives,
toasted melon seeds...

278
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:19,040
It's open, you can get in.

279
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,846
Last one in's a queer!

280
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:25,479
Naso, get an eyeful of this.

281
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:41,934
It's gorgeous!

282
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:42,659
Where are you, my love?

283
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,685
It was number 18.
18... Campari.

284
00:27:43,227 --> 00:27:45,491
Aldina, do you want to Know
who it was?

285
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:47,454
We Know, it was Campari.

286
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:49,696
I Knew him in the race at Monza.

287
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:01,599
Aldina!

288
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,717
Be careful, Lallo!

289
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:24,819
What is it?
- An ear.

290
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:27,392
LooK, an ear!

291
00:29:44,515 --> 00:29:47,313
Can I come in?
- I'm closed.

292
00:29:47,551 --> 00:29:48,848
Can I come in, miss?

293
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,911
What do you want?
- A cigarette.

294
00:29:57,394 --> 00:30:00,557
Can I help you?
- You couldn't manage.

295
00:30:00,764 --> 00:30:05,861
What do you mean? I can lift 80
Kilos. I can even lift my father.

296
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:12,331
What do you weigh?
- I don't Know.

297
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,508
I could lift you, too.

298
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:37,224
Let's see you.

299
00:30:37,935 --> 00:30:40,995
I really can.
- Let's see.

300
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,342
You silly boy,
put me down, let me go!

301
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:56,646
You're strong!
- I'll lift you again.

302
00:31:04,595 --> 00:31:05,960
Now that's enough.

303
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:21,605
What're you doing?
You'll let me fall! You mad thing!

304
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,113
Put me down, that's enough!

305
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:27,440
You'll let me drop, you crazy boy!

306
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,788
You really are mad...
What's happened to me? My head...

307
00:31:32,022 --> 00:31:34,889
See how many times I did it?

308
00:31:40,264 --> 00:31:46,362
Yes, my little darling...
Come here... you really are nice.

309
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:52,564
Drive me crazy, just a little.

310
00:31:53,143 --> 00:31:56,306
What should I do?
- SucK!

311
00:31:57,781 --> 00:31:59,942
Come on...

312
00:32:04,421 --> 00:32:06,912
You can have this one, too...

313
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,623
Don't blow! SucK!

314
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:15,788
Is this right?
- Yes, darling, yes!

315
00:32:17,768 --> 00:32:19,895
You have to sucK, you idiot!

316
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,362
I can't breathe!

317
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:27,203
Let me alone. Get out, now,
I've got to close up.

318
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:31,571
What was it you wanted?
A cigarette?

319
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:35,279
I'll give you one.
Now, beat it!

320
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:44,593
I can't manage it.

321
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:51,958
Come on, get out!
- Good night!

322
00:32:59,376 --> 00:33:01,003
DrinK it. It'll do you good.

323
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,207
It's hot!
- It has to be hot.

324
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:23,661
There's a fly.

325
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:26,935
Where is it?
- It was there.

326
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,905
The only house with flies
in winter...

327
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:37,779
How did it happen with you and Dad?

328
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:43,813
What? - How'd you meet,
fall in love, get married?

329
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:51,821
What's all this about?
Anyway, who remembers!

330
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:55,259
Your dad's not a great one
for compliments.

331
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:58,365
He was a laborer at Saludecio,

332
00:33:59,369 --> 00:34:03,669
my folKs had a bit of money and
they didn't thinK much of him...

333
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,568
Well, we eloped

334
00:34:08,779 --> 00:34:13,716
without saying a word to anyone.

335
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,553
When did he give you
your first Kiss?

336
00:34:18,422 --> 00:34:20,754
What Kind of a question is that?

337
00:34:22,292 --> 00:34:24,658
I don't even Know whether
there was one.

338
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:29,763
The first time, he raised his hat,
and that's all.

339
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:33,594
It was the most one could do
in those days.

340
00:34:33,804 --> 00:34:38,503
It's not liKe now,
when all Kinds of things go on.

341
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:43,339
But I never manage anything.
- Stay covered, you're all sweaty.

342
00:34:43,547 --> 00:34:46,675
What do you mean "manage,"
and you still in short pants?

343
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:50,683
Well, get me some long ones then,
liKe the other Kids!

344
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:52,913
What others? Gina!

345
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:56,955
She told me I wasn't to send
any more love letters.

346
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:00,858
Go and asK the doctor
to come as soon as he can.

347
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:04,724
Get him to examine you
at the same time.

348
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:06,061
Run along...

349
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:13,037
But I'll send letters
just when I liKe.

350
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:21,275
In Africa! I'll become
a doctor and go to Africa!

351
00:35:21,952 --> 00:35:23,544
That'll teach her!

352
00:35:37,734 --> 00:35:39,759
It's snowing outside!

353
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:51,644
It's true, it's snowing!

354
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:56,283
Professor Fighetta, up yours!

355
00:35:57,554 --> 00:36:00,216
If it goes on liKe this, there'll
be no school for a few days.

356
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:03,317
The mountains are all white.

357
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:06,052
Let's go and see the snow
on the sea.

358
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,691
It's wet, it won't sticK.

359
00:36:18,742 --> 00:36:21,302
Go away!
Get the hell out of the way!

360
00:36:46,436 --> 00:36:49,599
Stop there! The sparrows!

361
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:16,494
Wait, I'll come with you.

362
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:33,075
Titta! LooK how it's coming down!

363
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:38,319
Let's open the window.

364
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,550
Lovely!

365
00:37:46,396 --> 00:37:47,761
Me too!

366
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:56,498
It's still snowing! Four days
this goddamn stuff's been around!

367
00:38:05,315 --> 00:38:07,783
This will go down as
the Year of the Big Snow.

368
00:38:08,318 --> 00:38:10,684
Since the last Ice Age,

369
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:15,322
it never snowed so heavily
in our town.

370
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,394
That must've been a boy,
not the other person.

371
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:27,662
As I was saying...
the exceptional years were

372
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:30,840
1541... 1694...

373
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:34,499
1728... 1888...

374
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:38,875
when oddly enough,
it snowed on July 13th.

375
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:27,323
Where's she?

376
00:39:36,606 --> 00:39:40,565
How's your mother?
- Better now.

377
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:44,838
She's still in hospital,
but she's off the critical list.

378
00:39:45,315 --> 00:39:49,376
That's good, poor woman.
Give her my regards.

379
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,254
Your mother's a Kind lady.

380
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:55,049
She always gave me soup

381
00:39:55,258 --> 00:39:59,922
and wine. She's good...

382
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:36,726
How are you feeling?

383
00:40:38,401 --> 00:40:41,097
I've brought you some flowers.
- ThanK you. How are you?

384
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:46,297
Hello, Aurelio. They're lovely!

385
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:50,313
I was just looKing out,
now I'll go bacK to bed.

386
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:54,775
But I'm feeling better today.
What lovely colors!

387
00:40:55,785 --> 00:40:57,446
Are you hot, with this?

388
00:40:58,188 --> 00:41:00,622
Have you eaten?
- Yes.

389
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:22,876
Are you still annoying your father?
- He whips so hard!

390
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,615
I'll finish up, stupid!

391
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:39,590
There's a nice garden here,
I didn't Know.

392
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:43,324
It looKs as though it's in bloom,
with the snow.

393
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:45,057
It's still snowing.

394
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:53,106
In one way you're lucKy to be here
warm in bed, with this weather.

395
00:41:55,378 --> 00:41:59,405
He's tired, poor man,
when he gets home.

396
00:41:59,649 --> 00:42:02,584
You shouldn't answer bacK,
you're a grown up now.

397
00:42:04,854 --> 00:42:07,914
Don't throw ice! It hurts!

398
00:42:12,362 --> 00:42:15,889
Wind and rain, go home again.
I don't want to feel the pain.

399
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,163
Idiot! No!

400
00:42:26,142 --> 00:42:27,769
A quite difficult shot, Excellency!

401
00:42:38,054 --> 00:42:39,954
No! Not at Gradisca! No!

402
00:42:45,428 --> 00:42:47,328
Enough! I give up!

403
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:51,133
If you breaK my windows,
I'll breaK your sKull!

404
00:42:59,709 --> 00:43:00,698
Who is it?

405
00:43:07,917 --> 00:43:09,145
What is it?

406
00:43:17,794 --> 00:43:20,388
LooK, it's the Count peacocK!

407
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:26,427
There it is!
It's coming down!

408
00:43:35,178 --> 00:43:36,770
Shall we catch it, boys?

409
00:43:53,029 --> 00:43:56,260
I don't understand.
What's happened?

410
00:43:56,466 --> 00:43:58,866
I'll tell you in the car, Uncle.

411
00:43:59,402 --> 00:44:01,802
Why in the car?
Where're we going?

412
00:44:02,372 --> 00:44:05,034
Quite near. To Aunt Zaira's farm.

413
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:08,303
A relative's come from America
and wants to say hello to you.

414
00:44:09,412 --> 00:44:12,848
Well, why doesn't he
come here, then?

415
00:44:13,249 --> 00:44:14,910
Who is this relative?

416
00:44:42,712 --> 00:44:44,236
My aunt is dead.

417
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,046
Bear up.

418
00:44:58,795 --> 00:45:04,392
No, don't do that...
Open up!

419
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,204
No, I won't!

420
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,566
Lallo! He's fainted.

421
00:45:38,935 --> 00:45:40,630
Dad, Uncle's feeling poorly.

422
00:45:44,974 --> 00:45:47,238
TaKe him to the whorehouse, then!

423
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,106
MaKe the sign of the cross.

424
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:17,901
How do you feel now?
- Better!

425
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:24,036
Don't taKe it so hard...
be strong!

426
00:46:52,742 --> 00:46:55,643
Now everybody in line.
Where're the orphans?

427
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,510
Stop that!

428
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,047
Give me your arm, Naso.

429
00:49:47,717 --> 00:49:51,153
MaKe way, maKe way,
my breasts are full of milK!

430
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:58,694
I raise my glass
to the newly weds and say...

431
00:50:00,029 --> 00:50:02,224
May bride and groom find
marriage glowing in Battipaglia.

432
00:50:02,465 --> 00:50:05,434
When you're drunK,
you can even rhyme!

433
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:13,708
Gradisca's getting married
and going away!

434
00:50:15,778 --> 00:50:19,908
We're sorry if we made you angry,
and we hate to see you go!

435
00:50:23,419 --> 00:50:24,852
You'll miss us badly!

436
00:50:30,393 --> 00:50:32,861
Silence is golden,
but words are silver.

437
00:50:33,062 --> 00:50:35,724
May this married couple live
happily ever after!

438
00:50:36,699 --> 00:50:38,098
Where's the bride?

439
00:50:39,268 --> 00:50:43,466
Our Gradisca is going away because
she's found her Gary Cooper.

440
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,541
It's true that Gary's cowboy,
while Matteo is a carabiniere

441
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:51,339
but love's always love.
Good lucK, Gradisca!

442
00:50:52,515 --> 00:50:55,040
Long live the bride and groom!

443
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:57,913
You have crowned
your dream of love.

444
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:01,582
Now it's your duty
to have many children.

445
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:06,562
For your family, for the church
and for your country!

446
00:51:09,632 --> 00:51:13,830
Now we're all together...
one more toast before we leave.

447
00:51:16,906 --> 00:51:18,703
Photograph! Photograph!

448
00:51:18,908 --> 00:51:21,399
Now we'll taKe the photograph.

449
00:51:22,111 --> 00:51:23,703
A mirror!

450
00:51:25,648 --> 00:51:27,377
Everybody get behind the bride!

451
00:51:28,651 --> 00:51:31,916
She's lovely, our Ninola!
- Why're you crying?

452
00:51:32,121 --> 00:51:35,022
I'm not, now.
- Get closer together.

453
00:51:35,191 --> 00:51:37,125
The carabiniere
must move bacK a little.

454
00:51:39,061 --> 00:51:40,392
Stand in the light.

455
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:43,294
Hold it!
It's raining.

456
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:49,737
Smile.
- O.K., O.K. Another one.

457
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,801
Don't fall all over us,
you drunKen lout! - Gangway!

458
00:51:57,446 --> 00:52:01,007
Let's move into the sun, the bride
in the center. Ready for a photo?

459
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,924
I've made up another rhyme
that goes liKe this.

460
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:15,059
Though the world may be full
of beautiful things

461
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:20,031
Full of towns that are attractive,
even more than here,

462
00:52:20,236 --> 00:52:23,933
A drop of water'll be good
for you... you'll get a bath.

463
00:52:24,273 --> 00:52:25,570
Get up!

464
00:52:26,108 --> 00:52:30,101
It's stopped raining, sit down.
