1
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,589
Can I tell you a secret,
Sverine?

2
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,925
I love you more each day.

3
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,629
I love you too, Pierre.

4
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,263
You are everything to me,
but...

5
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,670
But what?

6
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:25,342
I would like everything
to be perfect.

7
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:29,405
-I feel this coldness from you.
-I don't want to talk about it.

8
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:34,079
I didn't mean to upset you.
I care about you so much.

9
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,179
What good is your care?

10
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,824
You can be very cruel
when you wish.

11
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,496
I'm really sorry, Pierre.

12
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,429
Stop!

13
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:02,540
Get out.

14
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,745
-Why? What's going on?
-I said get out.

15
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,150
But why?

16
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,381
Come!

17
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:09,979
-Let go of me!
-Come!

18
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,355
-Let go!
-Come!

19
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,155
Let me go!

20
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,219
Do what I said.

21
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,797
How dare you?!

22
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,205
Let go of me!

23
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,741
Let go of me!

24
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,943
It's not my fault.
I can explain.

25
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,679
Come on.

26
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,283
You can be rough with
the little tramp. Hurry!

27
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,226
Pierre, it's your fault too.

28
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:50,695
I'll explain.
I can explain everything.

29
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,426
Shut up, madame.
Or I'll shut you up.

30
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:02,934
Stop!

31
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,644
I beg you to tell them
to let me go!

32
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,547
Help!

33
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,782
Shut up, tramp!

34
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,090
Come on. Come.

35
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,562
Pull.

36
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:34,465
Don't scream. If you do
I'll kill you, you hear?

37
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,738
Pierre, I beg you.
Please forgive me.

38
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,277
Honestly.

39
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,557
Pierre, please,
don't let the cats out.

40
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,873
That's enough.

41
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,213
She's yours now.

42
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,151
-Pierre, I love you.
-Go ahead.

43
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,660
What are you thinking?

44
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,094
What are you thinking about?

45
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,568
I'm thinking about you.
About us.

46
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,578
We were riding on a coach.

47
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,079
The coach again?

48
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,446
Kiss me.

49
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,126
We have to wake up
early tomorrow.

50
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,064
-What for?
-To pack our bags.

51
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,692
-We're leaving?
-Yes.

52
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:10,100
To where?

53
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,331
It's my surprise
for our wedding anniversary.

54
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,866
Our happiness has lasted
a year already.

55
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,137
What about work?

56
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,668
I don't want to think
about it for a while...

57
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,510
and think only about you.

58
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,912
Happy?

59
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,424
Yes, specially
when you are here.

60
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,949
I wish we were
always together.

61
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,700
No, please!

62
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,946
Sleep tight.

63
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,317
Good night.

64
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,028
Pierre...

65
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,361
Yes?

66
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,594
Please forgive me.

67
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:19,537
You are so good,
so understanding and I...

68
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,802
All right. Go to sleep.

69
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,051
Are you going to the party?

70
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,783
I don't know.
Husson goes to bed at sundown.

71
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,724
Let him sleep
and come with us.

72
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,818
They say it's going
to snow tonight.

73
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:45,194
I'd love to see the magician.
They say he's great.

74
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,755
I won't let him
put me to sleep.

75
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:50,565
A magician is not a hypnotist.
He does magic.

76
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,731
The hypnotist digs into
your darkest secrets.

77
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,241
Well, I'll be going.
See you later.

78
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,970
-Bye.
-Bye.

79
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,617
What time is it?

80
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,918
Five o'clock.

81
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,892
You look bored.
Don't let me keep you.

82
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,484
How can I be bored?

83
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,725
It's not like I'm in a church
alone with the souls.

84
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,634
I want to say something
nice to you.

85
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,160
I love you.

86
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,831
Thank you.

87
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,898
Your hands are so soft.

88
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,670
Oh, please!

89
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,141
Do we have to go?
Husson is here.

90
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,813
Too late. They saw us.

91
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,846
What do you have against him?
He's interesting.

92
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,416
You think so?
I don't like his stares.

93
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,620
Let's go.

94
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,365
Hello.

95
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:57,835
Hello.

96
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,442
I saw you two go by before.
Arm in arm.

97
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,177
It's always nice
to see newlyweds.

98
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,878
That's a ridiculous greeting.

99
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:17,447
Not at all.
It's beautiful, very reassuring.

100
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,688
Pierre, sometimes you make
me feel so bad.

101
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:26,687
Men like you are
very hard to find.

102
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,832
I'm being sincere.

103
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,168
Well...thanks.

104
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,341
Look at that.
Two beautiful sights.

105
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,942
Why do you say that?
Do you know them?

106
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,044
No.

107
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,714
Is that all
you're interested in?

108
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,485
Everything else is useless.
A lot of wasted time.

109
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,824
You should take your obsession
to a specialist.

110
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:59,422
His two problems are having too
much money and too much time.

111
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:01,365
Don't forget hunting.

112
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,233
Also, I have a special
weakness for the poor.

113
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,329
I think about them
when it snows.

114
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,431
Without hope,
without anything.

115
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,601
You're so attractive, Sverine.

116
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:12,941
Keep your compliments
to yourself.

117
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,708
You're asking
for the impossible.

118
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:18,444
I've been here for too long.
I'm getting a headache.

119
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,543
-Is it cold outside?
-No, it's nice.

120
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:23,077
I need some fresh air.
I'll see you later, Rene.

121
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,522
-See you later.
-Have a nice walk.

122
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,093
I like him, he's funny.

123
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,723
He's strange.

124
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,529
Worse than that.

125
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,988
Any news from Husson?

126
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,049
He's fine.

127
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,252
You're still together?

128
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,954
Unfortunately.
Let's not talk about it.

129
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:07,159
-Do you remember Henriette?
-Of course.

130
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,429
It seems...

131
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,629
It seems she's working
in a whorehouse.

132
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,660
What?

133
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,570
You heard.
In a whorehouse.

134
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,939
It's true,
several times a week.

135
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:17,965
Oh, my...

136
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,979
Can you believe it?
Henriette!

137
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,574
-You must be shocked.
-No.

138
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:28,781
Think about it.
A woman like you and me.

139
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,153
Going with anybody.

140
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,886
In those places
you don't get to pick.

141
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:37,259
You have to take everyone.
Old, not old. Ugly, not ugly.

142
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:41,323
Even with someone you love
there are bad moments.

143
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,767
With a stranger
it must be horrible.

144
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,532
Those places still exist?

145
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:50,167
If you'll excuse me, ladies,
those places do exist.

146
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:55,579
They're not like they were
before the war.

147
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:58,378
Of course, there are
no more red lights.

148
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:02,148
And believe me,
their business is strong.

149
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,622
I can take you
to many of them.

150
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,852
It's my job, you see.

151
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,794
Driving a cab for 20 years,
I've seen everything.

152
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,492
I've been robbed twice,
if you care to know.

153
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,159
And I'm still here.

154
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,436
What's the matter?

155
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,804
We're here.

156
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,901
These flowers
arrived for you.

157
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,104
Good.

158
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,444
-Who sent them?
-Mr. Husson.

159
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,424
Why did you put them here?

160
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,763
I'll go get a cloth.

161
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,638
It's nothing.
It's just water.

162
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,005
What's the matter with me today?

163
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,495
Sverine, come fast!

164
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,278
Are you coming or not?

165
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,029
-Will you work much more?
-I'm almost done.

166
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,944
Can I ask you a stupid question?

167
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,378
Go ahead.

168
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,878
Before you met me,
did you go to those...

169
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,946
houses?

170
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,321
Whorehouses?

171
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,551
Not often. Why?

172
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,324
Are you interested?

173
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,628
Everything close to you
interests me.

174
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,359
Funny, I thought
they had been closed down.

175
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,268
Now they're clandestine.

176
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,771
I wonder what goes on in them.

177
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,504
-Listen, I have to work.
-Please.

178
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,780
You go in,
the women are there...

179
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,375
you pick one.

180
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,081

You spend
half an hour with her...

181
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:28,025
and after you leave
you're depressed all day.

182
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,960
Semen retentum venenum est!

183
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,257
Shut up.

184
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,026
Shut up. I don't want
to hear anymore, please.

185
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,502
What's the matter?

186
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,741
I've never seen you like this.

187
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,004
What's going on?

188
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,979
Nothing.
I'm just tired and nervous.

189
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,674
Go rest.

190
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,205
You're right.

191
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,751
Goodnight.

192
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,486
-Can I join you?
-No! No.

193
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,492
Yes, stay with me
until I fall asleep.

194
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,059
You'll never grow up.

195
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,977
I can't hit one ball today.
Replace me.

196
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,989
-Are you leaving?
-No, I'll wait inside. See you.

197
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,866
-Hello, how are you?
-Not bad.

198
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,597
We don't see much of you lately.

199
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,070
That's true.

200
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,437
See you.

201
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,639
Our mysterious Henriette.

202
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,711
The woman with two faces...

203
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,384
a double life.
How interesting!

204
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,986
-Did Rene tell you?
-Yes. But why?

205
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,964
For the money, definitely.

206
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:16,456
Most of the women that do it,
do it for the money.

207
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,269
It's good to see you, Sverine.

208
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,037
I can't understand
women like that.

209
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,443
It's the oldest profession
in the world.

210
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,504
Today, all you have to do
is make a phone call.

211
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,778
The women that work
in these houses are rare.

212
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,115
It seems like
you know them well.

213
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,850
Yes, I go there often.
I like the place.

214
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,859
The perfume,
women at your disposal.

215
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,587
I recall one near the Opera.

216
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,224
Madame Anais.

217
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:50,963
11 Cit Jean de Saumur.
I have great memories.

218
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,403
-Are you crazy?
-Don't take it seriously.

219
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,169
Cute compulsion
as the English say.

220
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,472
I'm harmless, anyway.

221
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:02,708
Sverine, one day I'd like to
see you without your husband.

222
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,808
I like Pierre, but it's better
if he's not there.

223
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,821
Madame Anais.
11 Cit Jean de Saumur.

224
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:07,189
Sverine, Sverine.
What's the matter with you?

225
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:45,761
What is it?

226
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,295
-I'd like to talk to you.
-Come in.

227
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,539
Good morning, madame.

228
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:53,839
Good morning.

229
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,177
Are you in charge of...?

230
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,239
I'm Madame Anais.

231
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:01,047
I came to see if...

232
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,554
Let's go in.
We'll be more at ease.

233
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,997
Sit down.
Can I offer you anything?

234
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,225
No, thanks.


235
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,394
-Cigarette?
-Thanks, I don't smoke.

236
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,599
Don't be afraid.
Make yourself at home.

237
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,164
I can help you. Sit down.

238
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:31,171
You're nice and fresh.
The kind they like here.

239
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,707
I know it's hard at first...

240
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,380
but we all need the money.

241
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,355
We split it half and half.

242
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:44,123
I have my expenses.

243
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:47,063
Thank you very much.
I have to go.

244
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,898
It's all right.
You're just nervous.

245
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,869
I can tell it's the first time
you're working.

246
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,102
It's not that bad.

247
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:01,806
It's still early.
The other girls aren't here yet.

248
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,781
You're about to lose a button.

249
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,751
When do you want to begin?

250
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,377
I don't know.

251
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,819
Today?

252
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,790
Maybe.
But only in the afternoon.

253
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:16,555
I have to leave at five.
I have to. Absolutely!

254
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:20,531
Two to five, no problem.
Be on time.

255
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,529
At five you'll be free to go.
I promise.

256
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,863
Good-bye. Excuse me.

257
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,397
I'll wait for you today at two.

258
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,326
What's the matter?
Something wrong?

259
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,831
No, I was shopping
in the neighborhood.

260
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,924
I just wanted to say hi.

261
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,832
I thought you hated hospitals.

262
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,005
I do. But I don't want
to stay alone.

263
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,803

Let's have lunch together.

264
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:06,277
I can't. I'm having lunch
with the boss. I told you.

265
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,802
-That's true but...
-I'm sorry.

266
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:11,839
Don't forget we're going out
with the Fvrets tonight.

267
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:13,510
Yes.

268
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,453
-Sorry to bother you.
-It's no bother.

269
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,716
See you tonight.

270
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,621
I'll go home
as soon as possible.

271
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:20,955
Pierre...

272
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,843
I wasn't counting on you.

273
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,812
You left in such a hurry
this morning...

274
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,610
I thought I had scared you.
Come in.

275
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,883
Put your things in here.

276
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,351
You'll meet the other
two girls very soon.

277
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:32,921
Mathilde and Charlotte.
Both very nice.

278
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:39,100
My girls have to be polite
and very cheerful.

279
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,896
You have to enjoy your work.

280
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:48,137
Just last week I let a girl go.
Very beautiful.

281
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:52,548
But she was too vulgar.
Too bad.

282
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:53,983
Sit down.

283
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,049
What's your name?

284
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:04,126
-I don't want...
-I don't want your real name.

285
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:06,756
Do you think my name is Anais?

286
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,495
We have to celebrate
your arrival.

287
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,059
No, thanks, madame.

288
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:15,766
Just a bit.

289
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:20,005
We need to find you a name.
Simple and cute.

290
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:22,172
Easy to remember.

291
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,147
Let's think together.

292
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:32,715
That's Mr. Adolphe,
one of our best clients.

293
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,454
You'll see, he's funny.

294
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,662
I have an idea.

295
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,961
Would you like to be called
Belle de Jour?

296
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,057
Belle de Jour?

297
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,863
Since you only come
in the afternoons.

298
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,460
If you wish.

299
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,271
You look nervous.

300
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,800
Relax.

301
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:55,677
You'll leave at five.
Don't worry.

302
00:26:57,182 --> 00:27:00,083
Is someone waiting for you?

303
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,450
A boyfriend?

304
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:04,614

A husband?

305
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,147
I don't want to be nosy.

306
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,819
Kiss me.

307
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,623
The girls are thirsty.

308
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,567
Wait for me. I'll be back.

309
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:26,842
Madame Anais!

310
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,313
A new girl!
Are you hiding her?

311
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,911
Go get her, fast!
Or I'll go get her myself.

312
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:45,794
Belle?

313
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,893
You'll see, he's funny.
He sells candy.

314
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,371
He has factories in Bordeaux.

315
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,534
He's a millionaire. Come.

316
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:04,506
If I don't get it every night,
I can't sleep.

317
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,575
The other day I had a black one.

318
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,450
What a party!

319
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,152
Here is Belle de Jour!

320
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,788
-Hello.
-Hello.

321
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,730
I told you
to close the curtain.

322
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:24,997
Belle de Jour, join the fun.
Have some champagne with us.

323
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,869
Anais, another round.
Hurry up!

324
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:31,672
Lucky girl!
Champagne on your first day!

325
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,974
It sounds like you
already had some.

326
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:39,482
Get to know each other.
I'll be right back.


327
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:40,916
Watch it!

328
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:46,386
Beautiful woman!
From head to toe.

329
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,585
Forget it!
She's too much for you.

330
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,526
That's exactly why.

331
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,053
Listen to him.
He wants everything.

332
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,565
What a guy!

333
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,296
That's very nice.

334
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,803
But you need to wear
something easy to take off.

335
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,169
Right?

336
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:04,369
She looks good to me
in that dress.

337
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,469
Very classy.
Just how I like them.

338
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,776
You promised me a present.

339
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:13,341
-I'd love a dress like that.
-I'm not a millionaire, honey.

340
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:14,749
Too bad.

341
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,650
What a great cut.

342
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,891
The details are incredible.

343
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,359
Dressing nicely
is easy with money...

344
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:27,125
-But you can't buy class.
-Here is the champagne.

345
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,594
Good, I was feeling dry.

346
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,530
No, let me do that.
That's a man's job.

347
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:40,772
I'm a world champion
bottle opener!

348
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,905
How talented!

349
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,246
I like ham and sausage

350
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,344
I really like
a good piece of ham

351
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:53,323
But I like even more
a good pair of legs

352
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,252
This is what happens
when it's not cold enough.

353
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:01,129
Warm champagne is like tea.

354
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:04,397
I'm sorry, I should have
placed it in the freezer.

355
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:06,232
You knew I was coming.

356
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,671
But I didn't know
Belle de Jour was coming.

357
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:13,006
To the person
I care most about! Me!

358
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:14,909
And to Belle de Jour.

359
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,408
It's good, just a little warm.

360
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,113
Mathilde,
I have a present for you.

361
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,621
I had forgotten.

362
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,458
-Here.
-What is it?

363
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,051
Open and see.

364
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,102
Thank you.

365
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:49,477
He's funny. You never know
what to expect from him.

366
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:53,541
Here's to fun! That's me!
I love life, I love to have fun.

367
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,020
Well, Belle de Jour?

368
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,460
Are you sad?

369
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,462
What's the matter?

370
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,403
You'll see.

371
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:20,235
We'll be happy together.
I promise.

372
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:30,252
-What's the matter with her?
-Give me a minute with her.

373
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,552
Don't rush her.
It's her first time.

374
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,423
-I've heard that before.
-It's true, I swear.

375
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,634
-Who does she think she is?
-She's new.

376
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:47,797
You're doing well.
You already did something.

377
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,172
Mr. Adolphe is a simple man.
Don't get worked up.

378
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,406
Do what he wants,
that's all he asks of you.

379
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:57,141
-No, I want to leave.
-What?

380
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:01,049
Do you think this is a game?
Remember why you're here.

381
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,313
Now go.

382
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,051
Yes, madame. I'll go.

383
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,079
I'll go.

384
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,423
Leave her alone with me.

385
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,758
You need a firm hand.

386
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,132
Go.

387
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:26,834
Hello.

388
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,436
Close the door.

389
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:32,843
Come.

390
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:37,583
I've sent the others away,
it will be more intimate.

391
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,522
Now...

392
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:42,287
it seems you're new at this.

393
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:47,293
Listen to me.
I have a nose for these things.

394
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,357
You don't fool me.

395
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:54,628
But if it's true,
you shouldn't be ashamed.

396
00:32:56,374 --> 00:33:00,242
Don't tell me that at your age
you're still a virgin.

397
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:03,877
We'll find out soon.

398
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:07,749
Well, do I scare you?

399
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,947
You don't like my face?

400
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:14,685
You better get used to it,
my little friend.

401
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,962
No, you can't do this to me.

402
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,333
Who do you think you are,
you little slut?

403
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,430
You turn me on and
then you take off?

404

00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:31,840
Games are fun for a while,
but enough is enough.

405
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,544
There.

406
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,674
See?

407
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,775
That's more like it.

408
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,645
So, you like it rough?

409
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:55,697
Jack of clubs, it's my gin.

410
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,905
Mr. Adolphe
is taking a long time.

411
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,498
That's normal.

412
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:08,939
Gin.

413
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,640
Sverine, where are you?
Are you ready?

414
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,140
There you are.

415
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,775
What's the matter?
Something wrong?

416
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,119
Are you sick?

417
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,487
You don't have a fever.

418
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,189
Do you want me to call someone?

419
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:08,221
It's nothing.
I fell asleep.

420
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,996
I had a headache.

421
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,798
I had an aspirin
and a hot shower.

422
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,499
I'll feel better tomorrow.
What time is it?

423
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,201
It's late.

424
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,937
I'll call the Fvrets
to tell them we're not going.

425
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,138
-You can go.
-I don't think so.

426
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,738
I'd rather stay here.

427
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,749
And I have some work to do.

428
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,520
Sleep well. Goodnight.

429
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,940
How's the soup?

430
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,753
It's cold.
It doesn't warm up.

431
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:13,029
Do bulls have names, like cats?

432
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,329
Sure. You could call
that one Remorse.

433
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,928
The one behind it
is Expiation.

434
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,014
What time is it?

435
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:35,212
Between 2 and 5 o'clock.
Not later than five.

436
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,847
-How is your wife?
-She's fine, thanks.

437
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,015
Where is she?

438
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,184
Over there.
Let's go say hello.

439
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:43,386
It will be a pleasure.

440
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:48,228
-How are you, little slut?
-Doing all right, bitch?

441
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,733
Old whore!

442
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,098
Maggot!

443
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:52,500
Pig!

444
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:53,935
Scum!

445
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:55,302
Garbage!

446
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:57,671
Tramp! Slut!

447
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,871
Pierre, I beg you to stop!
I love you!

448
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:07,107
What do you want?

449
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,676
I want to...

450
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,587
Have your spot back
and disappear suddenly...

451
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,457
-for a week without a word?
-Forgive me, I...

452
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:20,055
This place is not for amateurs.
The streets are for those.

453
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,689
Please, madame.

454
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,765
You're lucky
you're dealing with me.

455
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,136
I know people that would
throw you out without a word.

456
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:33,701
But I'm too good.

457
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:38,545
If you want to come back,
I need you to be serious.

458
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:39,810
Yes.

459
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,909
Can I count on you every day?

460
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,750
Yes, but only until five.

461
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:46,120
Let's go.

462
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,257
Hello, madame.
I'm happy to see you again.

463
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:52,489
-Hello.
-Hello.

464
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,498
Look. It's Belle de Jour.
How are you?

465
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,625
-Fine, thanks.
-You let us down.

466
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,295
-Why didn't you come back?
-I couldn't.

467
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,635
-Let me help.
-Thanks.

468
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:05,870
It's so cute.
I want to ask you a favor.

469
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:09,676
Can I borrow it this Sunday?
I'll bring it back Monday.

470
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:14,549
Listen, I hate to say no...
but it would be difficult.

471
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,018
Because...

472
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:18,078
It's all right.
You can find it at any store.

473
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,556
Cardin! How fancy!

474
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,291
Who are you?

475
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,123
-Was it tough coming back?
-No.

476
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,099
I do it
because of my boyfriend.

477
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,932
After his accident
he can't work anymore.

478
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,870
He knows I come here.

479
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,566
I love him very much.


480
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:39,440
Of course,
I could be a waitress...

481
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:42,810
-But how much would you make?
-That's true.

482
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:46,339
The Professor
will be here any minute.

483
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,842
I'll introduce you.
You're his type.

484
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:53,983
-Who is he?
-A famous gynecologist.

485
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:55,787
An international name.

486
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:58,124
He just got back from
an operation in Copenhagen.

487
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,625
Here he is.

488
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:03,098
-Fill her in.
-Yes, madame.

489
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,095
We need the light on.

490
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,338
You'll see, it's easy.
If they were all like him.

491
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,669
I have a new girl.

492
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,341
You'll like her.

493
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:21,442
A little shy, perhaps.
But a real aristocrat.

494
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,453
-Really?
-Trust me.

495
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,648
Good, send her in.

496
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,056
Come in, please.

497
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,472
What are you doing?

498
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,668
I'm...

499
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,200
Didn't they tell you?
Get dressed!

500
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:05,649
Come in.

501
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:14,053
The Duchess has called me?

502
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,258
Yes.

503
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:21,398
The Duchess is not happy
with my services?

504
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,269
Well...

505
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:25,172
No. Not really.

506
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,540
No.

507
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,640
-Madame Anais?
-Yes, here I am.

508
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:37,017
You belong in the kitchen.

509
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,454
She's no good.
Get me Charlotte. Hurry!

510
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,481
Right away.

511
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:42,822
Come.

512
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,256
-Charlotte?
-Yes.

513
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,633
The Professor wants you.
Hurry.

514
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,934
Just a second, madame.
I'm getting ready.

515
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:57,532
Come in here.
It isn't difficult.

516
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:10,580
Look.

517
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:16,217
Watch what Charlotte does.

518
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,125
And be very quiet.

519
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,339
Come in!

520
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:42,611
-The Duchess has called me?
-Yes, Victor.

521
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:45,121
The Duchess is not happy
with my services?

522
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:47,248
You're always making mistakes.

523
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:52,055
Yes, that's true.
It's true, I admit it.

524
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:56,829
But the Duchess is so good,
so forgiving, so beautiful.

525
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,300
How insolent!

526
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,067

Look!

527
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:07,635
Are you blind?
See this? Dust everywhere.

528
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:10,044
There, there and there!

529
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,849
I broke a vase.

530
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:17,319
A vase?
I'll break it on your head.

531
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:18,912
Victor, you're fired.

532
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:22,653
No, I beg you, Duchess,
to keep me.

533
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:27,255
Keep me. I'll pay attention.
I'll be careful. I swear.

534
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:31,632
-Not yet. Give me that.
-Sorry.

535
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,365
The Duchess can punish me
if she wishes.

536
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:37,841
She can beat me,
but don't fire me.

537
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:40,002
What are you doing?
You old man.

538
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,205
Nothing.
I'm not doing anything.

539
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:44,305
I keep my distance.

540
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:48,444
I shouldn't tell you this.
It's a secret, Duchess.

541
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,316
-I love you.
-What?

542
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:54,383
I love you.

543
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:59,961
And now that I've told you
I love you.

544
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,430
Walk on me.
Spit and stomp on my face.

545
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:11,299
You dirty old man.
You pig. I'll teach you.

546
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:14,606
But, Duchess, I love you.

547
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,578
Harder.

548
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,675
Hit me harder.

549
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:24,185
Come. Someone's waiting.

550
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,219
Did you watch?

551
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,919
What do you say?

552
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,690
How can anyone sink so low?

553
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,631
You might be used to it,
but I'm disgusted.

554
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,635
No, sir. I don't think so.

555
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:52,175
What about her?

556
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,706
Will she do?

557
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:03,816
What's this?

558
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:06,125
Credit card. Geisha Club.

559
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:09,462
No good here. Only cash.

560
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:20,207
All right. Go ahead.

561
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,919
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.

562
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:53,430
-Did you do well today?
-Yes, Mom.

563
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,131
-Did you behave?
-Yes, Mom.

564
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:59,939
Go say hello to your aunt
and show her your grades.

565
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:01,444
-Hello, Cathy.
-Hello.

566
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:03,173
How are you?

567
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,010
Show me your report card.

568
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,413
Aren't you going
to say hello to me?

569
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:11,045
Hello, Mathilde.

570
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:12,783
Hello.

571
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:14,688
Do you want to go
to the fair on Sunday?

572
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,124
Are you happy?

573
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:20,262
B in History,
but an A in Language.

574
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:23,931
Madame Anais!

575
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,527
-Madame Anais!
-What?

576
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,630
Now the Professor wants a pen.

577
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:32,164
-What's going on?
-He wants a pen.

578
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,541
A pen?

579
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,341
I don't have one.

580
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:02,998
-Go upstairs, do your homework.
-Yes, Mom.

581
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,628
That man would scare me, too.

582
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:32,100
Sometimes it must be hard.

583
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,533
What would you know, Pallas?

584
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,478
-May I, Miss?
-Please do.

585
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,887
Thank you.

586
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:32,462
-Miss or Mrs.?
-Miss.

587
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:35,260
Perfect.

588
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:36,856
What's your name?

589
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,834
Belle de Jour.

590
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,359
How charming.

591
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,532
I had a cat
called Dark Beauty.

592
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:48,007
Do you often come here?

593
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,979
In spirit, every day.

594
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:55,244
Beautiful day, isn't it?

595
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,446
Yes, truly.

596
00:50:57,487 --> 00:51:00,979
There's nothing as beautiful
as the autumn sun.

597
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:02,457
The dark sun.

598
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,756
Dark sun?

599
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:08,094
You look very elegant.

600
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:09,894
Thanks.

601
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,833
Do you like money?

602
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:14,833
Yes.

603
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:17,431
I would pay you well
to come to my house.

604
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:19,738
-To your house?
-Don't get me wrong.

605
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:22,404
It's for a religious ceremony.

606
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:25,677
It's very touching
and important to me.

607
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:28,810
I'm old fashioned.

608
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:31,252
Death still touches me.

609
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:36,686
If you accept,
I'd be a very happy man.

610
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:39,456
You're exactly
the woman I look for.

611
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,422
I live an hour away from Paris.

612
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:44,934
Here is my card.

613
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:48,162
I'll meet you at the station.

614
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:29,874
Here. Put this on, please.

615
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:32,711
What's this all about?

616
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:36,549
You don't need to be afraid.

617
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:40,454
The girls before you
would love to come again.

618
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,482
But the Duke
is very strict about that.

619
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:50,623
Would you follow me?

620
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:56,837
This way.

621
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,587
This way.

622
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:41,884
I brought you some lilies.

623
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:44,409
You loved them so.

624
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:46,285
You're so beautiful.

625
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:49,619
Your skin is even fairer.

626
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,461
Your hair is even softer.

627
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,143
My beloved girl.

628
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,043
Your face is cold.

629
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:21,349
Do you remember how
we had fun together?

630
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:23,689
We'd laugh and sing.

631
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:30,261
Now you're lying there,
saying nothing.

632
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:35,566
Please, forgive me.

633
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:38,665
It wasn't my fault.
I loved you so.

634
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,575
Your Lordship.
Can I let the cats in?

635
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,306
Leave us alone!

636

00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:50,576
We are alone.

637
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:54,289
The doors are closed.

638
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:01,790
Now...

639
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,766
your eyes won't open again.

640
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:08,861
Your body is still.

641
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:12,841
Worms are eating you up.

642
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:17,946
And the smell of dead flowers...

643
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,078
fills the room.

644
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:57,284
Still here?
What are you waiting for?

645
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,311
It's raining.

646
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,687
So?

647
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:05,460
Get the hell out of here!
Out!

648
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,182
Are you done?


649
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,655
Coming!

650
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:48,701
Want me to sleep with you?

651
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:05,319
I wish you'd want
to do this more often.

652
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:08,222
I will, Pierre.
Give me some time.

653
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,716
I feel like I'm pressuring you.

654
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,025
Don't feel that way.

655
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:17,191
I want you more every day.

656
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:19,258
I'm not afraid anymore.

657
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:22,169
I think
I understand you better.

658
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:25,038
We're getting closer.

659
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:27,304
Every day I love you more.

660
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:39,978
-Hello.
-Hello.

661
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,718
Is the missis here?

662
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:45,057
-Who should I announce?
-Mr. Husson.

663
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:51,532
Mr. Husson
would like to see you.

664
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:53,559
Tell him I'm not in.

665
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:03,612
Good-bye. Thank you.

666
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:19,192
You're so beautiful, Sverine.

667
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:24,661
-Can I give you a letter?
-I'd like that.

668
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:26,464
Would you accept?

669
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:29,298
There are a lot
of people around.

670
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,000
Even better.

671
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,235
Do we have a deal?

672
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,834
Deal.

673
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,316
-Like this?
-Yes.

674
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,616
What are they doing?

675
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,957
Nothing. Fooling around.
Take a look.

676
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:55,828
No, just tell me.

677
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,961
-He's giving her an envelope.
-And now?

678
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,097
It has some lily seeds.

679
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:07,306
Okay. I see.

680
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:09,174
Herald Tribune!

681
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,680
New York Herald Tribune!

682
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,375
Herald Tribune!

683
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:20,448
Herald Tribune!

684
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:26,990
New York Herald Tribune!

685
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:02,956
-What floor?
-Fourth, please.

686
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:08,771
Excuse me.

687
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:10,830
What are you doing?

688
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:13,341
Help! Help!

689
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:19,941
Don't goof up. Let's go.

690
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:21,712
Hurry up. Go.

691
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,998
Hippolyte!
What a surprise.

692
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:19,475
Hello, Anais.
Can we come in?

693
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,101
I suppose.

694
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:28,915
That way.

695
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,553
-It's Hippolyte.
-The Latin guy?

696
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:43,758
I thought we had
gotten rid of him?

697
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,633
There are two. I don't know
who the other one is.

698
01:01:46,669 --> 01:01:48,000
Who is this Hippolyte?

699
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:51,473
You'll find out soon.
Don't trust him.

700
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:53,805
When he has money,
he doesn't spare.

701
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:56,971
When he's broke,
he wants it for free.

702
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:59,447
Come on, girls.
All three.

703
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,019
-How about the little girl?
-Yes, sir?

704
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,891
Can we kiss her yet?

705
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:16,057
I don't think so.
She's still in school.

706
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:17,430
Great.

707
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:25,369
-Here they are.
-Hello.

708
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,808
-Hello, Mr. Hippolyte.
-Hello, Hippolyte.

709
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:31,439
-Buen ganado.
-What does that mean?

710
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:34,507
-How are you?
-Fine, and you?

711
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,812
Working.

712
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:38,787
We haven't seen you in months.

713
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:40,982
-We missed you.
-Really?

714
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:42,251
Where were you?

715
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:45,783
Traveling, in New York...

716
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:47,295
on business.

717
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:51,897
Put three bottles on the ice.
Good ones.

718
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,401
The best!

719
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:59,872
From Paris to heaven.

720
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:03,902
When I'm away what I miss
the most is the champagne.

721
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:07,211
And hot ladies like you.

722
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:12,079
I brought someone, a friend.

723
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:15,090
You must treat him well.

724
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,092
Sure, Mr. Hippolyte.

725
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:22,190
When we're alone,
I'll tell you another story.

726
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:25,064
-You'll love it.
-Save your breath, honey.

727
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:27,331
-Too bad.
-Nonsense...

728
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,439
Get off. You're heavy.

729
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,100
Come on.

730
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,302
Stop scratching. Go away.

731
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,744
Come here, new girl.

732
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:42,548
Now.

733
01:03:45,221 --> 01:03:46,688
Leave her to me.

734
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:56,560
All right, if you wish.
Go ahead, she's your age.

735
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:04,167
Thanks.

736
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:08,769
For less,
I'd break my father's head.

737
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:13,111
But friendship first.
We won't fight over a slut.

738
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:19,545
Tell me.

739
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:23,218
-Your friend is shy.
-Very much so.

740
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:25,853
The champagne is cold.
For everyone?

741
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,065
What's your name?

742
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:34,035
Belle de Jour.

743
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:35,799
What else?

744
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:36,930
That's it.

745
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:38,941
You don't trust me?

746
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:41,136
I want to know your name.

747
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:44,578
-Belle de Jour.
-Why? Is this your day job?

748
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,479
What do you do later?

749
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:49,450
Nice boots.

750
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,253
Your teeth...

751
01:04:57,293 --> 01:04:58,726
What happened to them?

752
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:00,956
Came out in one blow.

753
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:05,660
-Does that bother you?
-No.

754
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:07,635
Then let's get to it.

755
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:15,970
-How old are you?
-Twenty-three.

756
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:17,980
Does anyone take care of you?

757
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:19,413
What do you mean?

758
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:21,939
-Are you free or not?
-No.

759
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:25,647
Making money?
Business is good?

760
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:28,179
-Yes, but...
-Don't lie.

761
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:31,090
Leave your stockings on.

762
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:34,890
A girl tried
to strangle me once.

763
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,762
Poor girl.

764
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,994
If you want,
I won't charge you.

765
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:41,832
That's normal.

766
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:44,567
Many girls would love
to be in your place.

767
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:48,839
Are you going to
tell me your name?

768
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,937
Or you don't talk much?

769
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:54,245
Fine with me.
Girls that talk are a bore.

770
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:56,982
Not bad.

771
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:01,720
Too bad you only have two.

772
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:03,520
Let me see.

773
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:04,924
Turn around.

774
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:09,827
What's that little brown spot?

775
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:11,264
It's a birth mark.

776
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:14,167
Damn! I can't stand that!

777
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:15,693
Get dressed!

778
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:22,409
Not cold enough.
As always.

779
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:25,312
-You read in English now?
-Me? Not at all.

780
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:26,440
So?

781
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:28,143
Why do you care?

782
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:31,950
Abberfan inquiry accused...

783
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,979
Enough.

784
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,992
Take this to the room.
I'll be right over.

785
01:06:37,026 --> 01:06:38,994
The other one is for Marcel.

786
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:42,997
Who is your friend?

787
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:46,661
He saved my life a year ago.
I love him like a son.

788
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:49,671
That's why I let him
have the blonde.

789
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:52,265
-What's her story?
-Who? Belle de Jour?

790
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:54,742
Yes, is she in demand?

791
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:56,677
All the time.

792
01:06:56,712 --> 01:06:59,203
She's got class and...

793
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:01,182
And what?

794
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:03,617
-She's a pearl.
-A pearl?

795
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:08,752
A pearl!

796
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,925
I thought you wanted to leave.

797
01:07:12,962 --> 01:07:14,930
I'm glad I stayed.

798
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:16,864
I can tell you.

799
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:20,335
I like you.

800
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,098
Look at my hand.

801
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:23,867
It's still shaking.

802
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:28,937
What's this?

803
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:31,546
A scar.

804
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,605
-A knife wound?
-Maybe.

805
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:36,545
What are you doing here?

806
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:39,179
Don't ask.

807
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:42,088
I'd like to have you
till tonight, but I can't.

808
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:44,456
I like you too, Marcel.

809
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:46,188
Will you come back?

810
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,219
Maybe.

811
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:49,754
If you don't have money...

812
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:54,065
Money...is not a problem.

813
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:55,593
You scare me.

814
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:26,032
Looks like you're
having a good time.

815
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:28,901
I am. I would just like
to go to Paris.

816
01:08:30,139 --> 01:08:32,437
Why don't you tell me
everything?

817
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:34,409
What you're hiding from me.

818
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:39,312
If you tell me your problem,
maybe I can help.

819
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:40,713
Tell you what?


820
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:43,548
That you love someone.

821
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:45,645
-Someone else?
-Yes.

822
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:49,089
That's impossible.

823
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:53,721
I suggested this vacation to see
if anything held you to Paris.

824
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:56,663
I was right.
You want to go back.

825
01:08:56,699 --> 01:09:00,191
I always feel from you...
this distance.

826
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:04,000
I never feel you close to me.

827
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:05,700
Please forgive me.

828
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:08,643
I guess it's my fault.

829
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:12,340
-So you think I don't love you.
-That's what I think, yes.

830
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:21,288
I don't know how to explain.

831
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,451
So much of it
I don't understand.

832
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,859
What I worry about...

833
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:29,592
has nothing
to do with pleasure...

834
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:31,395
it's much more than that.

835
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:33,526
I don't expect you
to believe me...

836
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:36,436
but I've never felt
so close to you.

837
01:09:36,472 --> 01:09:38,064
You want to go home?

838
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:40,507
I'm telling you
I'm having a good time.

839
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:42,534
We can stay
another week if you want.

840
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:45,570
No, we'll go back tomorrow.
I must go back anyway.

841
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:03,827
See you.

842
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:06,633
Something wrong, Marcel?

843
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:09,832
I've never seen you like this.

844
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,237
Oh, shut up.

845
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:14,401
You're acting like an idiot.
Not like a man.

846
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:17,812
How is it going?

847
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:26,248
We were expecting you Thursday.

848
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:28,756
-So?
-Next time we won't wait.


849
01:10:29,858 --> 01:10:32,884
-We almost didn't come today.
-Really?

850
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:34,953
Money is tight.

851
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:38,262
We're sick of the two of you.
You and that creep.

852
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:41,235
Don't waste your time.
They're not worth it.

853
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:42,794
Forget it.

854
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:45,830
Mister, if you want to discuss,
do it outside.

855
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:47,671
Shut up.

856
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:51,975
Give me the money.
We know you have it.

857
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:00,181
Now, get out.

858
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:06,089
We'll talk about
the little creep.

859
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:07,527
If you wish.

860
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:40,093
Bartender! Another one!

861
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:52,304
-Where are you going?
-Make a phone call.

862
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:53,638
Again?

863
01:11:57,379 --> 01:12:00,075
Amazing, women.

864
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:03,573
You can say that again.
He's in love.

865
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:05,814
It's costing him a bundle.

866
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:08,550
But what can I do?
Nothing.

867
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:12,720
Hello, Anais. It's Marcel.


868
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:14,285
Any news?

869
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:17,995
Since when?

870
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:19,295
Really?

871
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,061
I'll be right there.

872
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:33,104
I need a four letter word.

873
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:37,177
The second is an N.

874
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:41,155
Enee with two E's.

875
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:44,682
Of course, that word always
comes up in crossword puzzles.

876
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:49,056
Belle, it's him.
He's waiting.

877
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:02,801
Hello, how are you?

878
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:12,352
Where were you?
Why did you leave?

879
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:15,357
I had to leave
for a couple of days.

880
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,383
-I can explain.
-I'll do the explaining.

881
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:20,361
And leave my signature.

882
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:29,027
Don't hit my face.

883
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:31,931
Don't touch me!

884
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:36,176
Do that one more time
and you'll never see me again.

885
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,011
This time you got lucky.

886
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,034
I missed you.

887
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:11,536
I waited like an idiot.

888
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:16,342
I want to see you more often.
Even at night.

889
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:18,319
I'm here every day.
That's not enough?

890
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:20,583
-No.
-You know I'm not free.


891
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:22,089
I don't care.

892
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:38,637
I don't understand.

893
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:40,642
I think you like me.

894
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:42,268
A lot.

895
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,643

But that's not enough.

896
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,170
You love him?

897
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:50,041
Then why are you here?

898
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:51,575
I don't know.

899
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:53,349
It's different.

900
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:20,142
I'm starving.
Where should we eat?

901
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,673
I have no idea. We'll think of
something on the way.

902
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:24,913
I won't be long.
I'll be back at 3.

903
01:15:26,822 --> 01:15:29,222
You've changed.
I don't recognize you.

904
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:32,955
-I'm happy to see you smile.
-I feel much better.

905
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:35,691
I've never seen you like this.
If only...

906
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:36,891
What?

907
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:40,368
If one day
you had big news for me.

908
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:41,733
What do you mean?

909
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:45,706
You know.
What I want the most. A child.

910
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:03,887
What are you looking at?

911
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:05,518
The wheelchair.

912
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:09,053
It caught my eye,
I don't know why. Funny.

913
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:12,089
-It's just a wheelchair.
-Yes, you're right.

914
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:23,667
It's been so long.
I didn't recognize you.

915
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:27,614
Thought you forgot about us.
It's been a while.

916
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:30,550
You haven't changed, though.

917
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,486
First door to your right.

918
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:39,527
Come on, girls.
Meet an old friend.

919
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:44,195
Go. Let's go. Cheer up.

920
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:51,539
Yes, you look beautiful.

921
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:58,037
-You're flattering me.
-No, I remember you well.

922
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,049
Sometimes
I even dream about you.

923
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,377
I like that.

924
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:06,785

-Oh, no, sir.
-Please, it's a pleasure.

925
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:08,187
Thank you.

926
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,554
-Good afternoon. Sit down.
-Thanks.

927
01:17:14,596 --> 01:17:18,032
These are Mathilde,
Charlotte, and Belle de Jour.

928
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:20,500
Belle de Jour...

929
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:22,765
that's original.

930
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:25,364
Would you like a drink?

931
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:26,840
Later, later.

932
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:30,342
Nothing has changed, Anais.

933
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:32,711
Still the same warm welcome...

934
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:35,239
the same curtains.

935
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,984
Whatever happened
to the lion tamer?

936
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:43,083
I don't know.
Haven't heard from him.

937
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:45,320
And the heater is on?

938
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,659
-You haven't changed, either.
-Look. The same chair.

939
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:53,363
I remember.

940
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:55,962
It was snowing.
And that same perfume...

941
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:58,268
Always jasmine.

942
01:17:58,306 --> 01:18:00,706
I hope you have
some time for us.

943
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:03,370
All my life.
I always have free time.

944
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:05,607
Well...

945
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:08,241
I'd like to be alone
with Belle de Jour.

946
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:15,880
No, I don't want to.

947
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:18,950
Where are your manners?
You will stay.

948
01:18:22,064 --> 01:18:23,725
She is really nice.

949
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:27,258
A little nervous sometimes.

950
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:32,974
Are you happy?

951
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:35,670
This is no coincidence,
you knew I was here.

952
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,303
You're wrong.

953
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:40,872
It's your fault.
You gave me this address.

954
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:43,646
-Again, you're wrong.
-Get any closer and I'll scream.

955
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:45,983
I'll cry for help,
I'll jump out the window.

956
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:53,324
Is this your bed?

957
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:55,829
You make me sick,
I already told you that.

958
01:18:55,864 --> 01:18:58,662
Yes, it's my bed!
What else do you want to know?!

959
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:02,466
You like being humiliated.
I don't.

960
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:06,597
Don't tell Pierre.

961
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:09,610
Pierre?
I admire him even more.

962
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:13,971
Please don't tell him.

963
01:19:14,015 --> 01:19:16,381
Why can't you understand?

964
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,079
I'm lost.

965
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,681
I can't help it.
I can't resist it.

966
01:19:22,824 --> 01:19:25,384
I know I'll pay dearly.

967
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:28,992
I can't live without it.

968
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:33,060
Do as you wish with me.

969
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:36,766
Not now.

970
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:41,640
What attracted me to you
was your virtue.

971
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:45,942
You were the wife of
a boy scout. That's changed.

972
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:48,472
I have principles, unlike you.

973
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:51,042
But I won't tell Pierre.

974
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:54,914
I have some friends that
would love to see you.

975
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:57,516
I can send them over.

976
01:19:57,559 --> 01:19:59,857
They'd be good business.

977
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:01,988
Sorry I'm not up to it.

978
01:20:02,998 --> 01:20:05,159
Next time, maybe.

979
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,827
Who knows.

980
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:08,961
Don't let me waste your time.

981
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:17,572
This isn't for you.

982
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:19,637
Get Pierre
some chocolates for me.

983
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:20,909
Bye.

984
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:11,424
Ready? Go!

985

01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:18,165
Ready!

986
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:19,537
Fire!

987
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:00,844
-He already left?
-Yes.

988
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:02,747
May I talk to you?

989
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:05,482
Go on.

990
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:15,263
-I must go.
-When?

991
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:16,821
Now.

992
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:19,265
-Will you come back?
-I don't think so.

993
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:21,269
Why?

994
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:23,703
Like that?

995
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:27,606
-Aren't you happy here?
-Yes, but...

996
01:22:27,642 --> 01:22:29,234
I understand.

997
01:22:31,012 --> 01:22:32,479
It's Marcel.

998
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:35,779
He was just here, furious.

999
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:38,809
Almost kicked your door in.

1000
01:22:38,853 --> 01:22:40,980
It has gone too far.

1001
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:45,752
He was saying you're only his.

1002
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:47,762
Day and night.

1003
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:50,959
Yes.

1004
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:54,162
Same old story with men.

1005
01:22:55,537 --> 01:22:58,472
You should go, you're right.

1006
01:22:58,506 --> 01:23:00,701
Before it gets worse.

1007

01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:04,804
But I'll be sad.

1008
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:07,542
Women like you...

1009
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:09,743
We got along well.

1010
01:23:09,784 --> 01:23:11,308
That's true.

1011
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:15,380
Keep in touch.
Give me a call once in a while.

1012
01:23:15,423 --> 01:23:17,220
It would be nice.

1013
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:20,421
-Give me your address...
-No.

1014
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:22,953
Well, I guess that's it, then.

1015
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:36,192
There is a man here to see you.

1016
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:37,966
-Me?
-Yes, madame.

1017
01:24:38,006 --> 01:24:39,837
Who is it?
Do you know him?

1018
01:24:39,874 --> 01:24:42,468
No.
But he says it's urgent.

1019
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:48,943
Hello.

1020
01:24:52,187 --> 01:24:54,712
-Did you bring the catalogue?
-Yes, I did.

1021
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:56,849
Sit down. Thanks, Maria.

1022
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,019
The catalogue idea is not bad.

1023
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:05,628
I like this place.

1024
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:08,135
What are you doing here?
Are you crazy? Go away!

1025
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:10,729
Since you're not
at Anais's anymore...

1026
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:12,706
I thought I should
pay you a visit...

1027
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:14,970
see how you're doing.

1028
01:25:15,009 --> 01:25:17,477
-How did you find me?
-Child's play.

1029
01:25:17,512 --> 01:25:19,878
Is this your husband?

1030
01:25:19,914 --> 01:25:23,281
Nice looking guy.
Very nice.

1031
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:24,945
Much better than me,
that's for sure.

1032
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:27,216
-Will you go?
-Don't worry.

1033
01:25:27,255 --> 01:25:29,621
I won't make a scene.

1034
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:32,285
I want to know why you left.
That's it.

1035
01:25:32,327 --> 01:25:34,056
-Do you hear me?
-Shut up!

1036
01:25:34,095 --> 01:25:35,687
The maid will hear us.

1037
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:38,528
Go. He'll be home soon.

1038
01:25:38,566 --> 01:25:41,194
I just got here
and you want me to leave?

1039
01:25:41,236 --> 01:25:43,466
-What do you want?
-To see you again.

1040
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:46,167
That's impossible.
I'm not going back there.

1041
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:53,247
I give you three days.

1042
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:55,476
Find an excuse,
doesn't matter what.

1043
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:57,451
I'll meet you
at the Hotel Dubois.

1044
01:25:57,485 --> 01:25:59,180
Fromentin St.

1045
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:02,314
-You'll stay with me all night.
-That's impossible.

1046
01:26:07,462 --> 01:26:08,861
Very well.

1047
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:10,364
I'll wait for him.

1048
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,128
-I have a lot to say to him.
-You wouldn't dare.

1049
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:18,833
Yes.
Maybe now you'll oblige me.

1050
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:22,975
It's just as well.

1051
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:24,672
I was going to tell him anyway.

1052
01:26:24,712 --> 01:26:25,974
Really?

1053
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:28,482
Sooner or later
he would have found out.

1054
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:30,575
A friend saw me.

1055
01:26:30,618 --> 01:26:32,848
It will take
a load off my mind.

1056
01:26:34,889 --> 01:26:37,289
Fine. We'll wait for him.

1057
01:26:37,325 --> 01:26:39,885
We'll give him the full picture.

1058
01:26:39,928 --> 01:26:41,589
It could be fun.

1059
01:26:50,672 --> 01:26:53,800
I beg you, leave.
He'll be arriving.

1060
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:09,650
Don't worry.

1061
01:27:09,691 --> 01:27:11,181
I'm leaving.

1062
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:14,785
I didn't believe you,
but I understand.

1063
01:27:20,034 --> 01:27:21,695
He is the obstacle.

1064
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:33,170
See you soon, Sverine.

1065
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:12,777
-Did you see her?
-Yes. Leave me the car.

1066
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:15,516

-What for?
-I need it.

1067
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:18,081
Leave me the car and go.

1068
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:20,253
What are you going to do?

1069
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:24,162
Leave, I said.

1070
01:28:24,198 --> 01:28:26,996
This once, kid. That's it.

1071
01:29:52,186 --> 01:29:54,450
Where do you think you're going?

1072
01:30:44,672 --> 01:30:46,071
Any news?

1073
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:48,439
The assassin is dead.
The police have no clues.

1074
01:30:48,476 --> 01:30:51,274
Either he made a mistake
or he went crazy.

1075
01:30:51,312 --> 01:30:53,405
-Was he identified?
-No good news.

1076
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:56,281
-He had a history.
-It's strange.

1077
01:30:56,317 --> 01:30:58,979
-And Srizy, how is he?
-Too early to tell.

1078
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:01,181
His wife is in the waiting room.

1079
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:24,104
How is he?

1080
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:27,512
Too early to tell,
but he'll live. Relax.

1081
01:31:27,548 --> 01:31:30,608
-Can I see him?
-No, he's still in a coma.

1082
01:31:30,651 --> 01:31:31,948
Maybe tomorrow.

1083
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:35,046
You should go home
and try to rest for a while.

1084
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:38,388
We'll update you every hour.
I promise.

1085
01:31:38,426 --> 01:31:40,485
Thank you.

1086
01:31:40,528 --> 01:31:42,018
Don't worry.

1087
01:31:46,067 --> 01:31:48,558
Come, I'll take you home.
Come.

1088
01:32:57,204 --> 01:32:59,934
Maria is getting the newspaper.

1089
01:32:59,974 --> 01:33:02,067
I'll read you the news.

1090
01:33:04,845 --> 01:33:08,008
Maria is so nice.
She likes you a lot.

1091
01:33:11,953 --> 01:33:13,978
Everyone's asking about you.

1092
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:17,948
You're getting better.

1093
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:20,859
The doctors are optimistic.

1094
01:33:20,895 --> 01:33:24,922
You're making a lot of progress.
Especially your eyes.

1095
01:33:27,301 --> 01:33:31,362
It's funny,
since your accident...

1096
01:33:31,405 --> 01:33:32,997
I haven't dreamt.

1097
01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:37,477
It's time for your medicine.

1098
01:34:04,438 --> 01:34:07,635
Mr. Husson, madame.
He wants to see your husband.

1099
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:14,679
I'm coming.

1100
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:27,654
Hello, Sverine.

1101
01:34:27,695 --> 01:34:29,959
I'm sorry to bother you.

1102
01:34:29,997 --> 01:34:31,726
You want to see Pierre?

1103
01:34:31,766 --> 01:34:34,064
Just for a moment.

1104
01:34:34,101 --> 01:34:37,002
He doesn't speak yet.

1105
01:34:37,038 --> 01:34:40,565
I know. I'm sorry
I couldn't come sooner.

1106
01:34:40,608 --> 01:34:44,169
I admire Pierre a lot,
but I was out of town.

1107
01:34:44,211 --> 01:34:45,803
Beautiful dress.

1108
01:34:46,914 --> 01:34:49,576
I'd call it
a precocious schoolgirl.

1109
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:52,876
What do you want
to tell Pierre?

1110
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,615
All I know about you.

1111
01:34:54,655 --> 01:34:55,644
What?

1112
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:57,521
Relax!

1113
01:34:57,558 --> 01:35:01,961
Now that he's paralyzed,
he feels like a burden.

1114
01:35:04,465 --> 01:35:07,628
He's ashamed of the trouble
he gives his pure wife.

1115
01:35:07,668 --> 01:35:10,330
So I decided
to tell him everything.

1116
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:14,674
He'll be hurt,
but I'll be doing him a favor.

1117
01:35:17,778 --> 01:35:20,212
You can't say I'm a cruel man.

1118
01:35:23,517 --> 01:35:25,314
Show me in, please.

1119
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:29,287
He's in there.

1120
01:35:34,962 --> 01:35:37,863
Would you like to witness
our conversation?

1121
01:35:42,503 --> 01:35:43,765
Hello, Pierre.

1122
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:19,593
Pierre.

1123
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:07,510
What are you thinking about?

1124
01:38:10,217 --> 01:38:11,809
About you.

1125
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:14,147
I'm thirsty.

1126
01:38:33,874 --> 01:38:36,843
-Would you like some ice?
-No, don't bother.

1127
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:41,939
I think I can take
a few days off.

1128
01:38:41,982 --> 01:38:44,507
-Can we go to the mountains?
-If you like.

1129
01:38:57,464 --> 01:38:58,988
Do you hear that?

1130
01:39:34,168 --> 01:39:40,300
THE END
