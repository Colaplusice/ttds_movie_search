He was arrested of being
suspected in many raping cases

However, due to the fear of the victims

and there were not enough
evidence so he's not prosecuted

Understood

151
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:36,823
One more point

152
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:41,467
l think KlRA is able to control the
behavior of the victims before they die

153
00:15:41,504 --> 00:15:44,098
The prisoners who left their letters

154
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,801
and people who had weird actions

155
00:15:45,842 --> 00:15:48,208
l think that were caused
by experiments from KlRA

156
00:15:48,244 --> 00:15:49,302
Experiments?

157
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:51,609
l think he has the purpose
to kill the FBl agents

158
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:55,913
and he wants to know their
control power before they die

159
00:15:55,952 --> 00:15:59,479
ln the same time, he passes me messages
through the letters from the criminals

160
00:15:59,522 --> 00:16:01,820
ln other words, they're
controlled by KlRA also

161
00:16:01,858 --> 00:16:05,988
There were 8 days in between the experiments
in prisons to the death of FBl agents

162
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:09,828
l afraid he met with one of the FBl agents

163
00:16:09,866 --> 00:16:13,996
controlled that agent and got
all the agents' information

164
00:16:14,036 --> 00:16:16,163
KlRA is able to find
out the investigations of

165
00:16:16,205 --> 00:16:18,469
FBl and he is able to

He is FBl agent. As everybody

She worked for me before

214
00:21:23,946 --> 00:21:28,508
May be she felt Raye had
something wrong so she followed him

215

Then unfortunately she saw his death

Misa, l've told you not to tell about KlRA

She wants to meet you, she
has something to ask you

This is the first time we meet

Nice to meet you

291
00:26:35,491 --> 00:26:38,255
l want to do a cover on KlRA

292
00:26:38,293 --> 00:26:42,024
Light, you met Raye before, right?

293
00:26:43,832 --> 00:26:48,792
He is the FBl we met in
the bus being hijacked

294

Ah

295

ln the process of investigating KlRA

296
00:26:53,142 --> 00:26:55,542
He was killed by KlRA

297
00:26:55,644 --> 00:26:57,475
How would it be?

298
00:26:57,846 --> 00:26:59,006
Don't you know it?

299
00:26:59,047 --> 00:26:59,445
But

300
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:03,077
he followed Light before

301
00:27:04,653 --> 00:27:08,248
Yes, so he suspected you're KlRA

302
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:13,327
So he was killed by me

303
00:27:13,362 --> 00:27:14,829
This is what you wanted to say

304
00:27:14,863 --> 00:27:17,730
As long as KlRA knows
the name then he can kill

305
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:21,827
So you use the bus hijacked
case to find out Raye's name

306
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,361
Ha ha, a strange lady

307
00:27:25,374 --> 00:27:28,741
However, Raye did not die after meeting me

308
00:27:28,777 --> 00:27:30,540
was three days after meeting you

309
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:32,979
Sorry if l offend you

310
00:27:33,382 --> 00:27:38,149
lf l were KlRA, l'll kill
him after knowing his name

311
00:27:38,187 --> 00:27:40,781
How would Light be KlRA

312
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:41,888
You

313
00:27:42,524 --> 00:27:44,583
There is a limit of offend

314
00:27:44,626 --> 00:27:50,826
l would have sue you so l
must record what you has said

315
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:53,797
This is because there were
other FBl agents besides Raye

316
00:27:53,836 --> 00:27:56,896
lf you kill Raye immediately
then you would be suspected

317
00:27:56,939 --> 00:27:59,100
so you must kill all the FBl agents

318
00:27:59,141 --> 00:28:02,508
So you didn't kill Raye on the spot

319
00:28:02,544 --> 00:28:03,841
Am l right?

320
00:28:04,346 --> 00:28:07,008
All the agents has dead?

321
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:09,517
Why there is no such news?

322
00:28:09,551 --> 00:28:11,712
As this is a confidential task

323
00:28:11,753 --> 00:28:13,516
[ Shioko, remember she has something
to do, rush towards Kinoshita]

324
00:28:13,555 --> 00:28:16,251
These are created by you

325
00:28:16,658 --> 00:28:20,025
Sorry Light, l don't she
is this type of person

326
00:28:20,062 --> 00:28:22,087
Then in the subway

327
00:28:22,264 --> 00:28:26,428
You use your tactic to get
other FBl agents' name from Raye

328
00:28:26,468 --> 00:28:27,935
killed all of them

329
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,030
[ Shioko, remember she
has something to do, rush

330
00:28:31,073 --> 00:28:34,133
towards Kinoshita, die
when crossing the road ]

331
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:38,010
Shiori, don't waste time, let's go

332
00:28:41,483 --> 00:28:42,745
Light Yagami

333
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:47,384
lt's no use if you want to kill me

334
00:28:47,422 --> 00:28:51,017
because l gave you the fake name

335
00:28:52,628 --> 00:28:54,619
Don't be too much

336
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,555
Raye is my fiancee

337
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:03,093
l'll find out the murderer of Raye

338
00:29:03,138 --> 00:29:07,040
l'll let him receive the punishment

339
00:29:07,943 --> 00:29:10,241
l think she is crazy

340
00:29:13,348 --> 00:29:14,372
Fake name

341
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:26,493
Somebody troubles you again

342
00:29:29,765 --> 00:29:33,724
Shinigami's eyes, you really don't want?

343
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:40,174
Ha ha, even the powerful Light
also don't know what to do

344
00:30:07,536 --> 00:30:11,768
According the report from the installer

345
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:17,100
Light go check whether there are
other people entering his bills

346
00:30:17,145 --> 00:30:22,105
He checked whether somebody
has entered his room

347
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:25,517
Only install many cameras in Light's room?

348
00:30:25,554 --> 00:30:31,720
lt's because l look through his
character, lQ, habitual life and summary

349
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,923
Light is the person who is
close to the KlRA's image

350
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:38,729
Even if guarding like
this, we're wasting time

351
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:40,735
Even if it has 1% of possibility

352
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:44,830
We'll investigate any suspicious thing

353
00:30:45,107 --> 00:30:49,134
lf not we're difficult to catch KlRA

354
00:30:55,432 --> 00:30:57,900
Wei, Light, please bother me

355
00:30:57,934 --> 00:31:00,425
Nobody will see it now

356
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:04,229
Give me apple

357
00:31:06,643 --> 00:31:08,133
Give me apple

358
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:12,642
l want to eat apple

359
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:22,549
Apple

360
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,824
What happened?

361
00:31:34,104 --> 00:31:37,301
L seems guarding me purposely

362
00:31:38,108 --> 00:31:40,872
The condition of my room is
different from this morning

363
00:31:40,911 --> 00:31:42,378
Somebody entered my room

364
00:31:42,412 --> 00:31:46,712
l think this room has installed cameras

365
00:31:51,121 --> 00:31:54,818
Light, are you looking down on L?

366
00:31:55,826 --> 00:32:02,527
lf we're being guard then l
cannot eat apple inside the room

367
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:10,530
l've to check the cameras position
and find out the dead angle

368
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:44,071
He studies in the room most of the time

369
00:32:44,107 --> 00:32:48,510
You must feel honour to have such a son

370
00:32:49,312 --> 00:32:53,009
His ambition is to be a policeman

371
00:32:54,618 --> 00:32:58,247
How to make Light not suspicious?

372
00:32:58,421 --> 00:33:01,584
There are no suspicious movements
made during the observation

373
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,490
and KlRA can kill people at this time

374
00:33:03,527 --> 00:33:05,654
He is innocent then

375
00:33:06,129 --> 00:33:09,394
Are you waiting KlRA to kill people?

376
00:33:09,432 --> 00:33:11,059
You may say so

377
00:33:15,739 --> 00:33:23,874
Please allow me to install spy cam
in Mr. Yagami's and Mr. Kazuku's house

378
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,183
The third day

379
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:34,914
Brother, have your meal

380
00:33:48,205 --> 00:33:49,729
l go to smoke

381
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:05,217
Chief, please take a rest

382
00:34:06,423 --> 00:34:10,484
You don't have good
sleep for these three days

383
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:15,726
Family is being suspected,
how can l sleep well

384
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:37,075
Three hunted killers were killed

385
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:41,448
Two killers died in the jail

386
00:34:41,491 --> 00:34:43,254
The news is confirmed

387
00:34:43,293 --> 00:34:44,590
ls it true?

388
00:34:46,396 --> 00:34:49,388
lt's too early to be happy

389
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,802
Don't you forget KlRA can
control the time of death?

390
00:34:56,206 --> 00:34:59,642
When a new criminal is reported

391
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:03,301
then only we can know the truth

392
00:35:16,426 --> 00:35:17,916
The fifth day

393
00:36:02,072 --> 00:36:03,767
The seventh day

394
00:36:03,973 --> 00:36:06,464
Mom, don't you worry?

395
00:36:06,576 --> 00:36:09,044
Dad hasn't came back for a week

396
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:11,070
Mom has use to it

397
00:36:11,781 --> 00:36:13,749
Dad is working hard now

398
00:36:13,783 --> 00:36:14,841
Sayu must be hardworking too

399
00:36:14,884 --> 00:36:15,373
Good

400
00:36:18,588 --> 00:36:22,752
Ai, brother eats potato chips
after dinner? You will gain weight

401
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:26,956
lt's ok, l'll burn midnight oil tonight

402
00:36:26,996 --> 00:36:27,928
l'm full

403
00:36:32,135 --> 00:36:34,262
He's so fearfulness

404
00:37:00,163 --> 00:37:06,033
45 US dollar and one million eight
thousand US dollar, ending the agreement

405
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:10,836
The petroleum price has
dropped to 60 dollar US

406
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:17,074
The high purchasing is the
main reason of rise this time

407
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:19,205
Next news

408
00:37:22,685 --> 00:37:26,052
[ Edogawa, a child was
kidnapped, suspect is arrested! ]

409
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:30,287
The criminal who is involves in
kidnapping 5 years old girl is arrested

410
00:37:30,326 --> 00:37:32,590
The arrested person is Kisha, 29 years old

411
00:37:32,629 --> 00:37:35,063
[ Kisha (29 years old)

412

Police found Melisa body in his apartment

413
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:47,904
Last month 28th, other children
saw Melisa near to that area

414
00:37:47,944 --> 00:37:53,041
Melisa was inside a red
colour car and missing

415
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:57,815
After that , Melisa's family got
the money request form the criminal

416
00:37:57,854 --> 00:38:00,584
He doesn't read the news

417
00:38:00,757 --> 00:38:05,126
We didn't report this news as we
are respecting the hostage's life

418
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:09,928
The arrested criminals is sent to
to the Boat Moat police station now

419

He is facing the media
and doing something weird

[ Why? ]

421
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:17,005
The fact after the trial...

422
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:33,555
lt seems there is something happened

423

Mr. Daisu

424
00:38:35,425 --> 00:38:40,419
Here is Boat Moat, the
suspect Kisha has dead

425

On the way of sending
Kisha to police station

426
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:54,302
Kisha was in pain suddenly, it
seemed he was having heart paralyse

427
00:38:54,344 --> 00:38:55,368
Mr. Daisu

428
00:38:56,646 --> 00:38:57,010
Yes

429
00:38:57,046 --> 00:39:00,072
This is indeed done by KlRA

430
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,712
Although the cause of death hasn't be

431
00:39:03,753 --> 00:39:07,314
identified but it's most
possible done by KlRA

432
00:39:07,357 --> 00:39:08,016
There is new criminal killed by KlRA again

433
00:39:08,057 --> 00:39:09,422
Now the police station is in alarm

434

00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:03,874
Ryuzaki,you're still not satisfied?

440
00:40:06,549 --> 00:40:10,645
Watari, take back all the spy cameras

lt's great, Sir Yagami

However, we need to start
a new investigation again

444
00:40:39,015 --> 00:40:40,983
Light, all the spy cameras were taken out

445

But Light

00:41:17,253 --> 00:41:21,246
lf your sister eats that snack, how?

449

Original potato chips, only l'll

KlRA indeed is Light Yagami

Even if l am KlRA

493
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:01,972
lt has nothing to do with Shiori

494
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:04,571
lf you want to kill then kill me

495
00:45:04,614 --> 00:45:09,278
l want you to know the pain
of losing the beloved person

496
00:45:09,318 --> 00:45:10,615
Don't, stop

497
00:45:12,021 --> 00:45:13,989
As long as you don't hurt Shiori

498
00:45:14,023 --> 00:45:14,614
Light

499
00:45:17,026 --> 00:45:18,960
lt is so shameful

500
00:45:20,229 --> 00:45:23,687
You as KlRA but can't even kill me

501
00:45:23,733 --> 00:45:26,201
Only can cry and beg me

502
00:45:26,235 --> 00:45:29,295
That's why l say l am not KlRA

503
00:45:29,338 --> 00:45:34,241
You can't kill if you don't get their names

504
00:45:36,946 --> 00:45:40,473
So let me tell you my real name

505
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,281
Naomi Misora

506
00:45:43,953 --> 00:45:46,751
Naomi Misora, N for north

507
00:45:47,857 --> 00:45:48,949
M for man

508
00:45:51,861 --> 00:45:55,262
Good, since you've got my name

509
00:45:56,966 --> 00:45:58,160
so kill me

510
00:46:05,574 --> 00:46:06,905
Naomi Misora

511
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:11,742
What happen to the local police

512
00:46:11,781 --> 00:46:13,248
They'll arrive soon

513
00:46:13,282 --> 00:46:13,976
Cannot

514
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:15,948
Let them go later

515
00:46:15,985 --> 00:46:17,543
What are you talking about?

516
00:46:17,586 --> 00:46:19,053
The following is the wonderful part

517
00:46:19,088 --> 00:46:21,249
What are you talking about?

518
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:23,315
This is not acting

519
00:46:23,993 --> 00:46:26,655
Do you want to save your girl friend?

520
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:28,561
Then just kill me

521
00:46:30,533 --> 00:46:32,398
Like how you killed Raye

522
00:46:32,435 --> 00:46:35,996
Like how you killed other criminals

523
00:46:36,038 --> 00:46:38,768
No need to use your hand

524
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:40,540
Just kill me

525
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:43,539
l've said l am not KlRA

526
00:47:37,933 --> 00:47:38,627
Shiori

527
00:47:39,035 --> 00:47:39,729
Shiori

528
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:43,733
Shiori

529
00:47:46,242 --> 00:47:46,731
How?

530
00:47:48,244 --> 00:47:50,075
How would it be?

531
00:47:50,246 --> 00:47:50,940
Shiori

532
00:48:01,857 --> 00:48:03,620
The criminal has gun

533
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:05,559
Shiori, be strong

534
00:48:07,563 --> 00:48:08,257
Shiori

535
00:48:09,865 --> 00:48:10,456
Light

536
00:48:11,867 --> 00:48:12,561
Shiori

537
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,240
We are kissing in the public

538
00:48:32,822 --> 00:48:33,516
Shiori

539
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:36,519
Shiori

540
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:40,523
Shiori

541
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:44,822
Why?

542
00:48:47,636 --> 00:48:49,866
Why you shot Shiori?

543
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:51,028
Why?

544
00:48:53,342 --> 00:48:54,036
Shiori

545
00:48:56,645 --> 00:48:57,339
Shiori

546
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:02,139
Why?

547
00:49:04,153 --> 00:49:04,642
Stop

548
00:49:16,866 --> 00:49:20,199
This is the result of misjudge

549
00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:23,135
The misjudge of Naomi Misora

550
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:25,402
was discovered by me

551
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:33,515
and her fault about telling
me she was Raye's fiancee

552
00:49:34,116 --> 00:49:37,882
Nobody will use a fake name in the wedding

553
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,356
and church is open to everybody

554
00:49:41,624 --> 00:49:43,888
lt's not difficult to find
out Naomi Misora real name

555
00:49:43,926 --> 00:49:45,553
[ Raye Penber ]

556
00:49:46,629 --> 00:49:48,358
[ Naomi Misora ]

557
00:49:52,835 --> 00:49:55,861
Naomi Misora, commit suicide

558
00:49:56,539 --> 00:49:59,508
For the purpose of her death fiancee

559
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:01,772
Lure the suspect out

560
00:50:02,344 --> 00:50:04,369
to the art gallery

561
00:50:05,447 --> 00:50:08,814
Kidnap the suspect's girl friend

562
00:50:08,851 --> 00:50:11,581
At 14:15 15th April 2006

563
00:50:13,556 --> 00:50:18,255
Let the hostage make a call to the suspect

564
00:50:19,862 --> 00:50:22,387
Get the second evidence

565
00:50:22,665 --> 00:50:25,429
By the guarding of the investigation team

566
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:29,460
Try to let the criminal expose his crimes

567
00:50:29,505 --> 00:50:32,474
but as seeing the hostage was running away

568
00:50:32,508 --> 00:50:36,239
14:55 tried to stop the hostage...

569
00:50:38,214 --> 00:50:40,648
Then she became insane

570
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:42,907
and killed herself

571
00:51:05,741 --> 00:51:06,332
Sorry

572
00:51:09,044 --> 00:51:12,172
lf we could arrive earlier...

573
00:51:18,354 --> 00:51:22,552
l go to order people to prepare a car

574
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:29,359
l've never thought Shiori would be killed

575
00:51:29,398 --> 00:51:31,298
You also misjudge

576
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:44,441
The person who killed Shiori is me too

577
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:51,252
l definitely use the Death Note

578
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,719
That's weird

579
00:51:54,223 --> 00:51:57,124
Shiori was killed by Naomi

580
00:51:57,226 --> 00:52:00,593
but you cannot write an action
to kill other people in Death Note

581
00:52:00,629 --> 00:52:06,534
lf the name written then
she'll die in heart paralyse

582
00:52:06,635 --> 00:52:08,865
l knew it definitely

583
00:52:10,439 --> 00:52:14,398
So l only gave instructions to Naomi

584
00:52:14,443 --> 00:52:17,207
and then wrote down Shiori's
name in the next page

585
00:52:17,246 --> 00:52:25,051
[ Naomi Misora, committed suicide,
lead the suspect to the art gallery ]

586
00:52:26,955 --> 00:52:30,186
Shiori, killed by other people

587
00:52:33,195 --> 00:52:37,461
She is involved in the
kidnapping case in the art gallery

588
00:52:37,499 --> 00:52:39,899
14:15 15th April 2006

589
00:52:42,604 --> 00:52:45,300
force to call boy friend

590
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:50,438
Try to runaway when police arrive

591
00:52:51,313 --> 00:52:54,544
14:55 When the kidnapper shot

592
00:52:55,217 --> 00:52:58,380
For the purpose of protecting her boy friend

593
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,820
and was shot to death

594
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:07,493
l didn't write about Naomi killed Shiori

595
00:53:07,529 --> 00:53:10,987
l didn't write about Shiori
was killed by Naomi too

596
00:53:11,033 --> 00:53:15,561
So did Naomi Kill Shiori was an accident?

597
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:23,307
lf from the point of killing Shiori

598
00:53:23,345 --> 00:53:27,805
The percentage of success is extraordinary

599
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:28,947
lt's not accident

600
00:53:28,984 --> 00:53:32,613
All happened according to my plan

601
00:53:32,888 --> 00:53:36,483
l wrote Shiori was shot to death

602
00:53:39,294 --> 00:53:43,822
and Naomi killed himself by using her gun

603
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,366
This is because normally
nobody will bring a gun in Japan

604
00:53:49,405 --> 00:53:52,203
lf Shiori was killed here

605
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:56,041
Then it was done by Naomi

606
00:53:58,213 --> 00:54:00,374
Do you know it, Ryuk?

607
00:54:00,416 --> 00:54:02,577
Names whose be written

608
00:54:02,618 --> 00:54:06,918
Their fate will be changed in naturally

609
00:54:07,322 --> 00:54:11,383
So even though l do not
write Naomi killed Shiori

610
00:54:11,427 --> 00:54:14,396
but all the things would
happen according to my plan

611
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:16,728
You're...a real devil

612
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:27,104
My Shiori died in front of me

613
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:33,642
Now if l give the reason of defeating KlRA
and wish to join the investigation team

614
00:54:33,682 --> 00:54:37,880
Everyone will feel pity and believe me

615
00:54:44,293 --> 00:54:44,987
Shiori

616
00:54:50,399 --> 00:54:54,927
Light, you look like Shinigami than we do

617
00:55:02,311 --> 00:55:05,303
Shiori was indeed loved you

618
00:55:08,016 --> 00:55:10,610
Don't you love Shiori?

619
00:55:17,326 --> 00:55:19,419
l also don't know

620
00:55:28,837 --> 00:55:31,533
Misa, do you feel lonely

621
00:55:32,441 --> 00:55:34,807
No, don't come over here

622
00:55:34,843 --> 00:55:38,506
Wish to die...that's what Misa wants

623
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:40,913
l don't have that kind of wish

624
00:55:40,949 --> 00:55:44,316
Let's go, let's go to parents' heaven

625
00:55:44,353 --> 00:55:46,878
l want to die with you

626
00:55:49,558 --> 00:55:51,890
You, are you kidding?

627
00:55:53,762 --> 00:55:58,324
Do you know the consequences if you do so?

628
00:55:58,367 --> 00:56:01,234
ln recording room, in
the lobby of TV station

629
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:04,034
l am watching you all the time

630
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:05,937
l want to die with you

631
00:56:05,974 --> 00:56:09,171
To die for you is my mission

632
00:56:10,479 --> 00:56:11,468
Bullshits

633
00:56:12,681 --> 00:56:17,414
Misa doesn't want to go to heaven or hell

634
00:56:24,893 --> 00:56:29,193
Don't be afraid, l won't make you pain

635
00:56:29,231 --> 00:56:29,720
Stop

636
00:56:32,935 --> 00:56:36,268
Help me, is somebody out there

637
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,431
Light

638
00:57:46,241 --> 00:57:47,970
The car is here

639
00:57:51,146 --> 00:57:52,670
Let's go home

640
00:57:54,049 --> 00:57:56,244
