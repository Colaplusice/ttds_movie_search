1
00:01:52,253 --> 00:01:55,086
Happy Thanksgiving!

2
00:02:02,699 --> 00:02:04,237
- Here!
- Right here!

3
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,879
Here you go, fellas!

4
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,719
Come! Come here.

5
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,658
This is the problem.

6
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:39,557
This is what's wrong with America.

7
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,635
It's gotten so big

8
00:02:41,964 --> 00:02:43,891
you just can't find your way.

9
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:45,792
The grocery store

10
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:48,233
on the corner is a now a supermarket.

11
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:49,548
The candy store

12
00:02:50,306 --> 00:02:51,709
is a MacDonald's.

13
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:54,109
And this place...

14
00:02:54,944 --> 00:02:57,225
a super fucking discount store.

15
00:02:57,434 --> 00:02:59,479
Where's the pride of ownership?

16
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:03,378
Where's the personal service?

17
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,163
See what I mean?

18
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,656
Shit...

19
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,592
What right do they have

20
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:19,642
of cutting out the suppliers?

21
00:03:20,278 --> 00:03:22,706
Pushing out all the middlemen.

22
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,106
Buying direct from the manufacturer.

23
00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:29,743
Sony this.

24
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:31,592
Toshiba that.

25
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,750
All them Chinks...

26
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:36,022
put Americans out of work.

27
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,348
<i>...plans to take place
in Quang Tri Province.</i>

28
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:41,635
<i>From Laos...</i>

29
00:03:43,764 --> 00:03:45,396
That's the way it is now.

30
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:50,437
You're all right ?

31
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:53,443
You can't find the heart of anything...

32
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:57,020
to stick the knife.

33
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:02,612
Anybody here?

34
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,037
- Can I help you?
- Call an ambulance.

35
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:07,552
Forget it, Frank.

36
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,718
There's no one in charge.

37
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:18,437
Call an ambulance!

38
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:22,148
<i>Some say Bumpy Johnson
was a great man,</i>

39
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,312
<i>according to eulogies,
a giving man.</i>

40
00:04:24,606 --> 00:04:26,710
<i>A man of the people.
No one chose to use</i>

41
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,283
<i>in remembrances
the word most often associated</i>

42
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,684
<i>with Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson :
Gangster,</i>

43
00:04:31,858 --> 00:04:34,183
<i>whose passing has brought
a Who's Who of mourners</i>

44
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:35,636
<i>on this chilly afternoon.</i>

45
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:37,870
<i>The KC mob boss,
Dominic Cattano.</i>

46
00:04:38,075 --> 00:04:40,208
<i>Harlem crime figure,
Nicky Barnes.</i>

47
00:04:40,843 --> 00:04:42,175
<i>From the political arena,</i>

48
00:04:42,398 --> 00:04:44,476
<i>the Governor has come down.
The Mayor of New York,</i>

49
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:46,572
<i>the Chief of Police and Commissioner.</i>

50
00:04:46,727 --> 00:04:48,532
<i>Sports and entertainment luminaries.</i>

51
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:52,132
<i>Bumpy Johnson,
age 62 when he passed</i>

52
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:55,725
<i>was a folk hero among Harlem locals
for over four decades.</i>

53
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:58,584
<i>Regarded by some as
the Robin Hood of Harlem,</i>

54
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:01,033
<i>by others as a ruthless criminal.</i>

55
00:05:02,526 --> 00:05:05,040
I would've thought that Warnfield
put out a better spread.

56
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:08,792
- Want some ?
- No, thanks.

57
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:11,028
I want chicken wings on mine.

58
00:05:11,813 --> 00:05:12,858
Who is that ?

59
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:14,903
He didn't know what hit him.

60
00:05:15,056 --> 00:05:16,780
I just kept poppin'
him in the face.

61
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,429
You got a light?

62
00:05:38,628 --> 00:05:39,882
That's very good.

63
00:05:40,657 --> 00:05:41,739
Hey, Frank !

64
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:45,657
Get me a light while you're at it.

65
00:05:48,408 --> 00:05:49,432
Appreciate it.

66
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:51,952
Don Cattano.

67
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:53,911
How you doing, Rossi?

68
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:56,975
- Good.
- A drink, Sir?

69
00:05:57,174 --> 00:05:58,410
Give him a scotch.

70
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:05,912
Come on.

71
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:17,846
I know you're hurting, Frank.

72
00:06:19,106 --> 00:06:20,123
So am I.

73
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:21,947
I'm all right.

74
00:06:22,622 --> 00:06:24,426
- You going to be all right?
- Yeah.

75
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,459
I'm sure Bumpy didn't tell you,
but he made me promise

76
00:06:27,635 --> 00:06:29,455
if anything happened to him...

77
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,071
I should make sure

78
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:32,856
that you're want for nothing.

79
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:35,660
I appreciate that.

80
00:06:36,715 --> 00:06:39,765
Half the people here
owed Bumpy money when he died.

81
00:06:40,464 --> 00:06:43,489
They think I'll forget to collect,
but I'll get that money.

82
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,571
Well... that's the spirit.

83
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:47,358
Go get them.

84
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:51,461
<i>Mr. Roberts!</i>

85
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,596
Taking the prosecution side,

86
00:06:53,972 --> 00:06:55,377
give us U.S. vs. Meade,

87
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:58,137
subject, issues,
what the determination was

88
00:06:58,325 --> 00:07:00,260
and what it means to us today.

89
00:07:01,168 --> 00:07:02,674
Class shall be critiquing,

90
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:05,020
Mr. Roberts, so pay attention.

91
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:09,713
<i>I hate hearing my name,
ya know ?</i>

92
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:12,035
Means I gotta get up
in front of the class,

93
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:15,016
I gotta turn around,
and I know everyone in there,

94
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,836
they know more than I do.

95
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:18,952
The N1 fear of people...

96
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:21,086
it ain't dying.
It's public speaking.

97
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,947
I get physically ill.
Wanna throw up.

98
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,777
And you wanna do that
for a living.

99
00:07:24,915 --> 00:07:26,910
I don't like being like that.
I want to beat it.

100
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:29,303
- Should I do this?
- No, he'll take it from me.

101
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:30,802
He knows me since high shool.

102
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:32,684
- High school?
- Good morning.

103
00:07:33,023 --> 00:07:34,901
He doesn't take it, just throw it in.

104
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:37,281
- That's good service.
- Throw it in?

105
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:41,004
- What's up, Suzie?
- Hi, Jay.

106
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:42,994
- How you doing, baby?
- All right.

107
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:10,741
You, punk !

108
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:14,460
You bit me, asshole !

109
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:18,294
I swear to God, Richie.
I didn't know it was you.

110
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:21,314
I'd never slam a door
on your hand, knowingly.

111
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:22,711
You bit my fucking hand.

112
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:24,534
What you doing
serving subpoenas anyway?

113
00:08:24,696 --> 00:08:26,585
- We're on loan to County.
- County?

114
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,981
- How's that working for you?
- Fuck you.

115
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:31,485
I'm sorry.
Consider me served.

116
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:33,049
Can we leave it there?

117
00:08:33,273 --> 00:08:34,999
Assault on a police officer?

118
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,426
I don't think so.

119
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:39,891
For old time's sake, what can we do,
what do you want, what can I give you?

120
00:08:40,194 --> 00:08:42,377
What do you get for assault
with a deadly weapon, Jay?

121
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,194
- 5 years minimum.
- 5 years.

122
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:46,304
Guys, c'mon ! No.

123
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:48,517
Guys, what do you want?
Who do you want?

124
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:50,249
- Who do you got ?
- You want...

125
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:52,727
Big Al's bookie, his accountant?

126
00:08:53,469 --> 00:08:54,911
I'll give him to you.

127
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:04,938
Stop, stop.

128
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:07,407
There he is.

129
00:09:10,254 --> 00:09:11,913
That's him. The bookie.

130
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:13,834
All right. Get lost.

131
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,209
- Right here?
- Right here. Get out of the car.

132
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:17,722
- This is nuts.
- Come on.

133
00:09:18,005 --> 00:09:19,013
Let's go.

134
00:09:19,978 --> 00:09:20,993
Take it easy.

135
00:09:41,505 --> 00:09:43,095
We stay with him or the car?

136
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:45,391
Let's see who comes for the car.

137
00:10:00,381 --> 00:10:01,763
Think he made us?

138
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:05,002
You called in a warrant, right?
So where are they?

139
00:10:05,185 --> 00:10:06,486
I just called, man!

140
00:10:06,992 --> 00:10:10,302
I called and walked back here,
and ten seconds has gone by.

141
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:14,853
We saw him with the slips, Jay.

142
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:17,359
You saw policy slips?
You saw grocery bags.

143
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:19,841
- You don't know what's in them.
- I do, and so do you.

144
00:10:20,004 --> 00:10:21,252
Don't give me that bull.

145
00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:22,735
What's the rush, Richie?

146
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,158
- Half an hour, the warrant'll be here.
- I got night school.

147
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:26,972
Guess you're gonna miss it.

148
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,498
- Fuck this. Come on!
- You sure?

149
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:39,189
Yeah, let's go.

150
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:33,704
Fuck!

151
00:11:43,658 --> 00:11:44,698
Fuck!

152
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:12,135
- It's not just a couple of bucks.
- It's the same thing, in principle.

153
00:12:13,161 --> 00:12:14,763
We're talking principles?

154
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,161
A cop who turns in
this kind of money...

155
00:12:17,343 --> 00:12:20,460
says one thing.
He turns in cops who take money.

156
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,472
- We'll be fucking pariahs.
- We're fucked both ways.

157
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:26,530
Not if we keep it. Only if we don't,
then right, we're fucked,

158
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:27,911
but not if we keep it.

159
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,909
Goddamn it, man!

160
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,291
Did we ask for it?
Did we put a gun to someone's head

161
00:12:33,474 --> 00:12:34,928
and say : "Give us your money"?

162
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:37,366
Cops... kill cops

163
00:12:37,718 --> 00:12:39,078
they can't trust.

164
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:43,729
We can't turn it in, man.

165
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:54,860
You believe that?

166
00:13:04,438 --> 00:13:05,797
How much is there?

167
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,076
Nine hundred
and eighty seven thousand.

168
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:12,703
What happened to the rest?

169
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:19,410
What the hell are you doing counting it
in front of everybody. Are you nuts?

170
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,855
Get it back in the bags, seal'em up,
and down it to the property room.

171
00:13:34,913 --> 00:13:36,269
Fucking boy-scouts.

172
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:50,809
So nice to see you here this evening.

173
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,604
What?

174
00:14:02,657 --> 00:14:03,555
What?

175
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:28,976
Detective Trupo.
Sign here.

176
00:14:34,017 --> 00:14:35,926
You guys ready
to make a lot of fuckin money?

177
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,713
- Always.
- Hell yeah.

178
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:43,345
Here you go!

179
00:14:43,969 --> 00:14:45,478
All right. Look at this.

180
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:48,083
- Fucking dealers.
- Here's three more boats.

181
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,221
Hey, don't lose any of that shit.

182
00:14:58,571 --> 00:15:00,317
- I know.
- Be careful.

183
00:15:04,743 --> 00:15:06,328
Just enough for the reagent test.

184
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:09,319
A little less.

185
00:15:15,557 --> 00:15:17,799
<i>This is the French Connection dope.</i>

186
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:21,880
<i>Kilos of the same dope Eddie Egan
and Sonny Grasso took from us!</i>

187
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:24,723
<i>The cops seize it, arrest everyone,</i>

188
00:15:24,894 --> 00:15:27,200
<i>and they start taking it out
of the evidence room,</i>

189
00:15:27,396 --> 00:15:30,498
<i>whacking it down to nothing
and selling it back to us.</i>

190
00:15:30,954 --> 00:15:33,265
<i>They basically
control the market with it.</i>

191
00:15:33,468 --> 00:15:35,439
Mr. Rossi.
A surprise.

192
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,139
<i>They've been doin this for years.
They live off it.</i>

193
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,817
- <i>Our dope.</i>
- Many thanks.

194
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,271
What the fuck is happening
to the world, Frank?

195
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:44,104
Fuckin crooks.

196
00:15:45,535 --> 00:15:46,893
Sad about Bumpy.

197
00:15:49,273 --> 00:15:51,181
Things are never gonna be the same
in Harlem.

198
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:53,139
You walk down the street.

199
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:56,184
Nobody bothers you
cause Bumpy was making sure of it.

200
00:15:56,821 --> 00:15:57,918
Here, Frankie.

201
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:00,257
How is it there now?

202
00:16:01,346 --> 00:16:03,377
It's chaos.
Every gorilla for himself.

203
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:12,335
Who can live like that?

204
00:16:12,794 --> 00:16:14,291
There has to be order.

205
00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:16,453
That would've never happened
with Italians.

206
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:18,985
More important than
any one man's life...

207
00:16:19,663 --> 00:16:20,820
is order.

208
00:16:28,628 --> 00:16:29,648
Frank.

209
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:33,727
Come on in.
Sit down.

210
00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:40,164
- How y'all doin?
- Good.

211
00:16:40,635 --> 00:16:43,281
- So, you seen Nate over there?
- Yeah, all the time.

212
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,636
Nate is everywhere.

213
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:46,469
- He's good.
- He's still over there.

214
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:48,105
Got himself a club now.

215
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,740
Where, Saigon?

216
00:16:49,923 --> 00:16:50,959
Bangkok.

217
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:52,900
I don't think he's ever comin home.

218
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:58,940
Come on.

219
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:28,235
On the house
for our boys in uniform.

220
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:30,686
Thank you, sugar,
that's very kind.

221
00:17:32,044 --> 00:17:33,230
Thank Frank.

222
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,508
Thanks, Frank.

223
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:37,560
Just relax.

224
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:41,184
You gonna have to boot this,
shoot a couple times.

225
00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:44,064
Cops keep cutting it.

226
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,946
Selling the shit.

227
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:50,945
I won't say anything
cause the price is right.

228
00:17:51,586 --> 00:17:53,087
But that shit in Nam

229
00:17:53,378 --> 00:17:54,674
is way...

230
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,694
way...

231
00:17:57,251 --> 00:17:58,606
heavy...

232
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:25,024
Didn't you see the jar, Frank?

233
00:18:26,353 --> 00:18:28,361
I think you walked right past it.

234
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,200
The money jar.
What I gotta do?

235
00:18:31,464 --> 00:18:33,089
Put a fuckin sign on it?

236
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,517
What are you thinking?
You know,

237
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,054
Bumpy don't own 116th no more.

238
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:44,903
He don't own no real estate
in Harlem right now. I'm the landlord,

239
00:18:45,065 --> 00:18:46,669
and the lease is 20 %.

240
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:50,851
Well, don't sell dope then, Frank.

241
00:18:51,186 --> 00:18:53,471
Get a real job.
Need a fuckin job, Frank?

242
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:56,246
Is that what you need?
You come work for me.

243
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:59,402
You can drive me around.
You open my doors.

244
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:03,770
Yes sir, no sir, right away sir.
Anything you want, Master Johnson.

245
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,481
20 %.

246
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:17,923
20 % is my profit, Tango.

247
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:22,525
I give you that, what do I got left?
Nothing.

248
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,719
20 % puts me and everyone you know
out of business.

249
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:28,484
There are legitimate ways
of doing things,

250
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,489
and there's this way.
Not even Bumpy took 20 %.

251
00:19:32,192 --> 00:19:33,613
Bumpy's fuckin dead.

252
00:19:37,364 --> 00:19:38,371
My man.

253
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:40,165
20 %?

254
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:50,326
20 %.

255
00:19:50,969 --> 00:19:52,416
Doc! Let's go.

256
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,713
<i>The drug problem in Vietnam
is more</i>

257
00:19:57,922 --> 00:19:59,525
<i>than marijuana.
At this point,</i>

258
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,416
<i>it is estimated that one third
of American troops are experimenting</i>

259
00:20:03,614 --> 00:20:05,299
<i>with opium and heroin.</i>

260
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:07,948
<i>The authorities say they've confiscated</i>

261
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:11,564
<i>large quantities of marijuana,</i>
<i>heroin, and pills.</i>

262
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:14,619
<i>Every person and every vehicle
going through the gates</i>

263
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:17,009
<i>is subject to a thorough shakedown.</i>

264
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,991
<i>Soldiers have access to the drugs</i>

265
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:23,308
<i>at many rest and relaxation spots
in Bangkok, Saigon, and other areas</i>

266
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:25,236
<i>throughout Vietnam and Thailand.</i>

267
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:27,613
<i>Officials say the easy availability</i>

268
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:30,971
<i>of relatively cheap cost
of high purity heroin</i>

269
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:33,217
<i>throughout Saigon and the Far East</i>

270
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:35,664
<i>is leading to an epidemic
of heroin addiction</i>

271
00:20:35,847 --> 00:20:37,451
<i>among U.S. soldiers.</i>

272
00:20:41,264 --> 00:20:43,069
- <i>Operator.</i>
- Yeah, international.

273
00:20:43,252 --> 00:20:45,310
- <i>What city?</i>
- Bangkok.

274
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:46,762
<i>You know the country code?</i>

275
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:48,123
Yeah, 376.

276
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,436
- <i>For the first 3 minutes, it'll...</i>
- I got it, I got it.

277
00:20:57,114 --> 00:20:58,562
- <i>Sawadeekap.</i>
- Hello?

278
00:20:58,682 --> 00:21:00,416
<i>"Soul brothers".
Can I help you?</i>

279
00:21:00,536 --> 00:21:01,497
Nate!

280
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,008
- <i>Do I know you?</i>
- It's me.

281
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:06,785
- <i>Who?</i>
- Me, Frank! Your cousin, negro.

282
00:21:11,097 --> 00:21:12,457
Go get yourself a new suit.

283
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,268
Look, I'm sorry.

284
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,702
Please, Richie.

285
00:21:53,214 --> 00:21:55,815
Couldn't be avoided.
I'll take him next weekend, OK?

286
00:21:56,923 --> 00:21:58,003
We're moving.

287
00:21:58,582 --> 00:22:00,205
What? Where?

288
00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:03,603
The St. Regis.
What do you care?

289
00:22:06,913 --> 00:22:08,071
My sister's.

290
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,095
Your sister's. In Vegas?

291
00:22:10,523 --> 00:22:12,561
- Yeah.
- You're not moving to Las Vegas.

292
00:22:12,681 --> 00:22:13,970
Not with Michael.

293
00:22:14,553 --> 00:22:17,066
What am I supposed to do with him?
Leave him with you?

294
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:18,777
There's a picture.

295
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:20,881
Hey, guys!
Be cool.

296
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,934
Laurie, Las Vegas

297
00:22:25,183 --> 00:22:26,970
is not the kind of place
to raise a kid.

298
00:22:27,235 --> 00:22:28,781
Oh, like this is a good environment?

299
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:30,398
And around your friends?

300
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:32,288
When am I supposed to see my boy?

301
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:34,285
This weekend, last weekeend.

302
00:22:38,895 --> 00:22:40,561
I asked you nice to shut up, right?

303
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:42,307
Now I'll have to kill you.
I swear

304
00:22:42,592 --> 00:22:45,052
I'll pull out my gun
and put a bullet in your fuckin head!

305
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:47,113
Stop what you're doin,
and pick up the glass!

306
00:22:47,315 --> 00:22:48,838
Calm down, man. Be cool.

307
00:22:52,593 --> 00:22:53,983
He's fuckin crazy.

308
00:22:55,198 --> 00:22:56,396
You don't have a gun.

309
00:22:59,743 --> 00:23:00,819
You sure?

310
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:10,856
You're crazy, Richie.

311
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,967
You don't have room for us.

312
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,714
I'll see you in court.

313
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:23,809
Come on, Michael!

314
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:25,963
Say bye to your dad.

315
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:28,846
Hey, kiddo!

316
00:23:31,216 --> 00:23:33,470
See you next week.
We'll do something.

317
00:23:35,395 --> 00:23:37,141
Let's get you an ice cream.

318
00:24:02,328 --> 00:24:03,884
<i>You have 10 minutes remaining.</i>

319
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:06,316
10 minutes.

320
00:25:20,073 --> 00:25:22,814
Girl, don't talk.
I wanna do a little funk.

321
00:26:00,787 --> 00:26:01,889
How much you want?

322
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,362
Tell him I want a 100 kis.

323
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,879
Ain't nobody I know
who can get you that much.

324
00:26:10,042 --> 00:26:12,133
You have to piece it together
from different sources.

325
00:26:12,377 --> 00:26:14,001
And it's not gonna be 100 % pure.

326
00:26:14,895 --> 00:26:16,218
I don't want that.

327
00:26:16,486 --> 00:26:18,054
I know what you don't want.

328
00:26:18,225 --> 00:26:22,478
But you'll need to get
to the Chi-Chou syndicate, all right?

329
00:26:23,078 --> 00:26:25,480
In Cholon, Saigon.
If they'll deal with you at all.

330
00:26:25,643 --> 00:26:28,063
I understand, but
by then, it'll be too late.

331
00:26:28,215 --> 00:26:30,785
It'll be already chopped up.
I want to get it where they get it from.

332
00:26:30,905 --> 00:26:31,944
The source.

333
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:34,279
- And get it yourself?
- Why not?

334
00:26:36,352 --> 00:26:37,553
I came this far.

335
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:40,866
- You'd go into the motherfuckin jungle?
- I'm in it. Look around,

336
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,998
They're eating these roaches,
whatever that is.

337
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,663
Nigga, I'm talking about snakes.

338
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:49,371
Tigers, Vietcongs, mosquitos
that'll fuckin kill your ass.

339
00:26:51,681 --> 00:26:53,593
- You wanna go into the jungle?
- We're going.

340
00:26:56,508 --> 00:26:58,043
- Fuck it, let's go.
- We're going.

341
00:26:58,186 --> 00:26:59,180
Why not?

342
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:43,267
Hey, Frank.

343
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:47,404
This whole spot's locked down
by the Kuomintang.

344
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,403
General Chang Kai Chek's
defeated army.

345
00:28:30,282 --> 00:28:32,221
How would you get it into the States?

346
00:28:32,705 --> 00:28:34,483
You ain't got to worry about that.

347
00:28:34,654 --> 00:28:37,903
- Who do you work for in there?
- Don't worry about that either.

348
00:28:38,527 --> 00:28:39,667
Who are you really?

349
00:28:40,835 --> 00:28:42,897
Frank Lucas,
like it says on my passport.

350
00:28:43,115 --> 00:28:45,634
- I mean, who you represent?
- Me.

351
00:28:48,237 --> 00:28:51,904
You think you're going to take
a 100 kilos of heroin into the U.S.

352
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:55,332
and you don't work for anyone?
Someone's going to allow that?

353
00:28:56,306 --> 00:28:57,410
That's right.

354
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,710
After this first purchase...

355
00:29:07,388 --> 00:29:10,018
if you're not killed
by Marseilles importers...

356
00:29:10,723 --> 00:29:12,918
or their people in the States...

357
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:15,626
then, what?

358
00:29:16,312 --> 00:29:19,159
Then there'll be more, much more.
I guarantee you.

359
00:29:19,963 --> 00:29:23,111
And if it's all the same to you, I don't
have to drag my ass here no more.

360
00:29:24,842 --> 00:29:25,956
Of course not.

361
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:30,185
My man.

362
00:29:31,161 --> 00:29:33,277
- Soul brothers?
- Soul brothers.

363
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:19,539
Fifty grand. It'll cover them,
the pilot and the boys on the other end.

364
00:30:20,796 --> 00:30:22,223
Give them a hundred.

365
00:30:23,246 --> 00:30:24,680
Fifty will cover it.

366
00:30:25,294 --> 00:30:27,466
Give them a hundred, the whole thing.

367
00:30:28,263 --> 00:30:29,283
And look.

368
00:30:30,324 --> 00:30:31,550
That's all I got.

369
00:30:31,703 --> 00:30:34,242
If that dope don't arrive,
for any reason...

370
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,021
Listen.

371
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:42,050
Cousin or no cousin,
I'm a busy man, all right?

372
00:30:42,261 --> 00:30:44,616
I got no time to go
to nobody's funeral.

373
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,993
I'll let you know
when it's in the air.

374
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,635
My man.

375
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:15,921
<i>Richie?
Fuckin guy made me,</i>

376
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,052
don't know how he did,
but he did.

377
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:19,959
<i>He went for his gun!</i>

378
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,625
I had to do it, man!

379
00:31:21,782 --> 00:31:23,233
A hundred people out there heard

380
00:31:23,446 --> 00:31:25,549
the shot. You gotta help me,
you gotta do something!

381
00:31:27,836 --> 00:31:28,999
Where are you, Jay?

382
00:31:30,312 --> 00:31:31,674
That's the problem.

383
00:31:35,013 --> 00:31:36,733
Dispatch, I got a 10-13.

384
00:31:36,913 --> 00:31:38,247
I got a 10-13.

385
00:31:38,722 --> 00:31:40,445
<i>Copy that. What's your 20?</i>

386
00:31:41,228 --> 00:31:42,388
Tower 2.

387
00:31:44,329 --> 00:31:45,532
Floor 1G.

388
00:31:46,593 --> 00:31:48,482
Canton West, in the projects.

389
00:31:48,766 --> 00:31:51,472
- <i>Identify yourself, please.</i>
- Detective Richard Roberts.

390
00:31:51,816 --> 00:31:54,158
<i>Negative, I got no units in that area.</i>

391
00:31:54,422 --> 00:31:55,437
Bullshit.

392
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:58,526
Please put the call out again.
I'll need assistance.

393
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:02,130
<i>Det. Roberts, I got no units
in that area, that's a negative.</i>

394
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:31,684
Why you goin' thru, motherfucker?

395
00:32:33,307 --> 00:32:34,430
Be cool!

396
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:36,079
Be cool, all right?

397
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:38,379
I'll find out what's going on in here.

398
00:32:47,431 --> 00:32:48,479
Richie.

399
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,037
<i>Open the motherfuckin door!</i>

400
00:32:57,189 --> 00:32:58,468
Where's your backup ?

401
00:33:00,031 --> 00:33:01,879
You got no backup?
Why is that?

402
00:33:05,906 --> 00:33:06,921
Bandage his neck.

403
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:09,701
- Richie, he's dead.
- I know he's fuckin dead, right?

404
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:12,527
Bandage his neck, clean up his head.
Prop him up on the gurney

405
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:14,663
so he's sittin,
and open his fuckin eyes.

406
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,343
- All right? Let's go!
- Fuck.

407
00:33:21,655 --> 00:33:23,057
OK, clean him up.

408
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,666
Give me your gun.

409
00:33:35,937 --> 00:33:36,993
Your gun!

410
00:33:40,305 --> 00:33:41,425
You have your badge?

411
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,460
You guys ready?

412
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:47,434
Just keep moving forward.

413
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:49,780
- You all right?
- Yeah.

414
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,393
It's OK!

415
00:33:53,962 --> 00:33:55,600
Injured man coming out.
Step back.

416
00:33:59,018 --> 00:34:00,845
Let them do their job.
He'll be all right.

417
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:04,453
Step back.

418
00:34:07,316 --> 00:34:08,926
That's fine.
That's it.

419
00:34:11,436 --> 00:34:12,655
He's alive.

420
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:15,258
What happened inside?

421
00:34:26,121 --> 00:34:27,183
Thanks, man.

422
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,651
Fuck.

423
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:33,160
The asshole pulled a piece on me.
Can you fuckin believe it?

424
00:34:33,352 --> 00:34:35,916
He pulls a piece on a cop?
Had to do it, man.

425
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,439
Kill or be killed.

426
00:34:38,438 --> 00:34:40,118
Fuckin crazy world, right?

427
00:34:43,318 --> 00:34:45,189
What the fuck were you doing
on the projects?

428
00:34:45,432 --> 00:34:47,886
Investigating stuff, man,
you know.

429
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:50,327
Just like you taught me.

430
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:53,289
Checking on guys,
following things up,

431
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,135
putting the pieces together.

432
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,565
The guy was a fucking dealer.
Scum of the earth!

433
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:02,874
That guy
didn't pull a gun on a cop, Jay.

434
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:05,043
That guy pulled a gun on a junkie.

435
00:35:06,153 --> 00:35:07,630
The junkie was trying to rob him.

436
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,282
What the fuck you sayin?

437
00:35:10,872 --> 00:35:12,821
What the fuck you doin, man?

438
00:35:13,025 --> 00:35:15,231
- What the fuck is that?
- That money's mine, man!

439
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:17,164
I earned this shit!
It's mine!

440
00:35:17,405 --> 00:35:19,050
I earned it doing good cop work.

441
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:21,760
- I got it doin good cop work!
- You murdered him!

442
00:35:21,943 --> 00:35:24,054
- And gettin shot at!
- You murdered the guy!

443
00:35:24,971 --> 00:35:26,791
You murdered him,
you robbed his money,

444
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,483
then you called me to get you out.

445
00:35:28,608 --> 00:35:30,222
Makes me an accessory after the fact.

446
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:31,603
I'll tell you the facts,

447
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:34,264
just write the report
the way i see it happened.

448
00:35:34,495 --> 00:35:36,248
And then that's the way it is.

449
00:35:36,483 --> 00:35:38,351
And that's how it'll all be.

450
00:35:39,542 --> 00:35:40,709
I can't do that.

451
00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:45,604
I'm a leper because I listened to you
and turned in a million bucks.

452
00:35:45,956 --> 00:35:47,715
No one will work with me after that.

453
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:51,041
I can give up this shit, Richie!

454
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,679
That's easy.

455
00:35:53,302 --> 00:35:54,836
Just write the report.

456
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:56,461
Between us.

457
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:57,879
As partners.

458
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:00,841
I can't do that.

459
00:36:07,054 --> 00:36:08,043
Stop!

460
00:36:47,907 --> 00:36:49,064
Open the trunk.

461
00:37:11,975 --> 00:37:14,716
<i>Get out!
Get out of Vietnam!</i>

462
00:37:18,108 --> 00:37:21,222
<i>As loud as we can
that the Vietnam war should stop,</i>

463
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,477
<i>and that the best way to stop it</i>
<i>is for the United States</i>

464
00:37:24,712 --> 00:37:27,988
<i>to simply pack up</i>
<i>and get out of Vietnam right now!</i>

465
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,943
How are we looking?

466
00:37:37,938 --> 00:37:41,286
Typically what I see
is 25 to 45 % pure.

467
00:37:41,641 --> 00:37:44,507
There are no adulterants, no alkaloids,
no dilutents.

468
00:37:45,623 --> 00:37:47,134
It's a hundred percent.

469
00:37:52,445 --> 00:37:54,308
- May I?
- Take it with you.

470
00:37:56,076 --> 00:37:57,132
Thank you, Frank.

471
00:39:53,904 --> 00:39:54,953
I'll take it.

472
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,528
No contingencies, no loan,
no nothing.

473
00:39:59,023 --> 00:40:00,038
Cash.

474
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,353
Fabulous.

475
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:09,589
Im not talking
about your proclivities.

476
00:40:09,815 --> 00:40:12,954
Those I only know too well.
Im talking about being a cop.

477
00:40:13,943 --> 00:40:15,830
You talking about taking money?

478
00:40:16,466 --> 00:40:17,867
I don't do that.
Not my thing.

479
00:40:18,118 --> 00:40:20,537
And your friends from the hood,
still hang out with them?

480
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:22,863
Yeah. Play baseball on the weekends.

481
00:40:23,265 --> 00:40:25,316
Wise guys?
It's gonna look good.

482
00:40:26,146 --> 00:40:28,252
Guys I went to school with, so what?

483
00:40:28,548 --> 00:40:30,175
What about Joseph Sadano?

484
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:32,981
What about him?

485
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:35,757
Im just trying to understand
things your wife has said.

486
00:40:35,938 --> 00:40:38,655
- If they're not true, tell me.
- Yeah, hes one of them.

487
00:40:39,121 --> 00:40:41,125
Is he also your sons godfather?

488
00:40:41,748 --> 00:40:43,292
He's definitely fucking her.

489
00:40:43,586 --> 00:40:45,255
Do you really care about this?

490
00:40:45,867 --> 00:40:48,213
Or do you just not want her
to win ever?

491
00:40:52,004 --> 00:40:55,219
You know there's an interview room?
On the second floor.

492
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,663
- That's what I thought.
- Door locks from the inside.

493
00:40:57,939 --> 00:40:59,062
All rise!

494
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:09,094
Fuck me like a cop, not a lawyer.

495
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,161
Don't answer!

496
00:41:41,801 --> 00:41:43,573
- Richie Roberts.
- Hey, Norm!

497
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:48,649
- Richie Roberts.
- Hi, Det. Norman Riley.

498
00:41:48,811 --> 00:41:50,476
- Hi, Norman. How are you?
- Good.

499
00:41:51,786 --> 00:41:53,147
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

500
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:04,484
Nice night to come out, huh?
It's like Grand Central around here.

501
00:42:05,321 --> 00:42:06,626
It's been like this.

502
00:42:07,084 --> 00:42:08,810
I'm lucky if I get home by midnight.

503
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,022
It's like nothing we've seen before.

504
00:42:16,405 --> 00:42:17,770
Something I gotta sign?

505
00:42:18,149 --> 00:42:19,612
Yeah, this way.

506
00:42:20,398 --> 00:42:22,921
I'm taking this with me.
I'll register it, all right?

507
00:42:26,696 --> 00:42:29,095
<i>America's public enemy number one</i>

508
00:42:29,324 --> 00:42:32,042
<i>in the United States</i>
<i>is drug abuse.</i>

509
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,518
<i>In order
to fight and defeat this ennemy,</i>

510
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,424
<i>It is necessary to wage</i>

511
00:42:38,072 --> 00:42:39,635
<i>a new all out offensive.</i>

512
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,595
<i>Federal authorities
have announced their intention</i>

513
00:42:43,736 --> 00:42:47,045
<i>to establish special
narcotics bureaus in Washington</i>

514
00:42:47,204 --> 00:42:49,037
<i>New York, Los Angeles, Chicago...</i>

515
00:42:49,228 --> 00:42:50,975
A detective without the support

516
00:42:51,198 --> 00:42:53,480
of his fellow detectives
really can't do much.

517
00:42:55,507 --> 00:42:57,010
You know why I don't have it.

518
00:42:58,353 --> 00:43:00,509
Doesn't matter.
You do what you have to do.

519
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:04,455
The greatest city in the world
is turning into an open sewer.

520
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,018
Everybody's stealing.

521
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,036
Dealing.

522
00:43:10,313 --> 00:43:12,362
You can't work
because you did your job!

523
00:43:13,822 --> 00:43:16,624
Good news is you're not
the only honest cop in town.

524
00:43:17,236 --> 00:43:19,183
This special narcotics bureau
in Washington

525
00:43:19,345 --> 00:43:21,150
is not a dog and pony show.

526
00:43:21,998 --> 00:43:23,200
They're sincere.

527
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,376
I know it because
they want us to orchestrate it

528
00:43:25,537 --> 00:43:27,829
and I want you
to head up things here on our end.

529
00:43:28,104 --> 00:43:29,667
If it's federal,
who do I answer to?

530
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:31,366
- Post office?
- You answer to me.

531
00:43:31,617 --> 00:43:33,911
Me and the U.S. Attorney,
nobody else.

532
00:43:36,037 --> 00:43:38,162
You never step foot
in a police station again,

533
00:43:38,561 --> 00:43:39,927
work out at your own place.

534
00:43:40,122 --> 00:43:41,384
You pick your own guys,

535
00:43:41,533 --> 00:43:44,870
Guys that you know wouldnt
take a nickel off the sidewalk.

536
00:44:07,308 --> 00:44:08,762
- Huey.
- <i>Huey!</i>

537
00:44:09,227 --> 00:44:10,713
- What of what?
- <i>Who's this?</i>

538
00:44:10,998 --> 00:44:12,054
Who you think, boy?

539
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:14,360
- <i>Frank!
- Frank who?</i>

540
00:44:14,813 --> 00:44:16,234
<i>Your brother, negro.</i>

541
00:44:20,403 --> 00:44:22,079
- That's right.
- Marvin!

542
00:44:22,561 --> 00:44:23,759
- Where's Ma?
- What?

543
00:44:24,145 --> 00:44:25,931
Where's...
Frank's on the phone!

544
00:44:26,347 --> 00:44:27,626
How you doin, Frankie?

545
00:44:27,778 --> 00:44:29,223
Frank, on the phone!

546
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,465
- Say what?
- Ma, Frank on the phone!

547
00:44:32,906 --> 00:44:33,929
Oh, my Lord!

548
00:44:34,156 --> 00:44:36,267
Yo, when?
You just say it, man.

549
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:37,627
<i>I'll call you back</i>

550
00:44:37,821 --> 00:44:40,196
at 6 o'clock.
Get everybody together, all right?

551
00:44:40,371 --> 00:44:41,386
Mama, everybody.

552
00:45:02,888 --> 00:45:04,347
How you doin, Uncle Frank?

553
00:45:05,143 --> 00:45:06,949
Get out of the car!
It's here.

554
00:45:08,521 --> 00:45:09,586
Look at this!

555
00:45:10,479 --> 00:45:11,737
My Lord!

556
00:45:12,102 --> 00:45:14,008
So glad to see you, boy.

557
00:45:14,714 --> 00:45:18,913
I'm telling you,
some piece of land you got here.

558
00:45:20,398 --> 00:45:22,855
- I wonder what the Boro people'd say.
- And whose house is that?

559
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:24,891
That is your house, Mama.

560
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:27,302
- Mine?
- That's yours.

561
00:45:28,914 --> 00:45:30,093
And who else?

562
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:46,164
Listen!

563
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:48,334
I wanna tell you how happy I am.

564
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:50,660
Seeing all my children at the table,

565
00:45:50,843 --> 00:45:52,992
and the grand children
at the same time.

566
00:45:53,424 --> 00:45:54,621
I'm so happy!

567
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:56,997
- Right on, Grandma!
- Enjoy yourselves.

568
00:45:57,393 --> 00:45:59,395
I hope you got a job,
the way you eatin all this.

569
00:45:59,864 --> 00:46:01,884
That boy, he got an arm on him.

570
00:46:02,657 --> 00:46:03,738
A Major League arm.

571
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:05,270
- Oh yeah?
- Right?

572
00:46:06,326 --> 00:46:07,341
Right on, Pop.

573
00:46:07,624 --> 00:46:10,261
After dinner,
let's see him throw around a bit.

574
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:11,991
You can't catch him, man.

575
00:46:12,162 --> 00:46:14,875
I'm telling you,
he throws harder than Gibson.

576
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:17,580
We're talking 95 miles an hour.

577
00:46:17,867 --> 00:46:18,903
Can you catch him?

578
00:46:20,192 --> 00:46:21,625
He'd go catch the grass.

579
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:24,479
He might have catched that thing
when I was about 5 years old.

580
00:46:24,783 --> 00:46:26,266
Since then, he can't keep up.

581
00:46:30,044 --> 00:46:31,633
This is your room.

582
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:32,824
Perfect.

583
00:46:35,812 --> 00:46:37,083
Look at this.

584
00:46:40,104 --> 00:46:41,351
It's beautiful.

585
00:46:41,597 --> 00:46:43,216
Real beautiful, this.

586
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:52,681
How did you...

587
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:54,263
I had it made.

588
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,367
From memory.

589
00:46:57,622 --> 00:46:59,235
You were 5 when they took it away.

590
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:00,760
- Right.
- How could you...

591
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,527
How could I forget, Mamma?

592
00:47:07,388 --> 00:47:08,954
I thought you did.

593
00:47:09,776 --> 00:47:11,295
It, it... is perfect.

594
00:47:11,755 --> 00:47:13,398
It's all perfect.

595
00:47:18,956 --> 00:47:21,380
I can't tell you
how much I love you.

596
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:23,174
I love you too, Mother.

597
00:47:24,545 --> 00:47:25,548
It's okay.

598
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:37,606
Both these guys, good with wires.
They got solid informants.

599
00:47:37,985 --> 00:47:39,293
They're honest.

600
00:47:39,466 --> 00:47:40,682
And fearless.

601
00:47:41,023 --> 00:47:42,958
They're insane, Richie,
like you.

602
00:47:43,941 --> 00:47:45,048
Where are they?

603
00:47:48,506 --> 00:47:50,653
That's Jones,
with the skinny white broad.

604
00:47:51,262 --> 00:47:53,018
Best I've ever seen on the street.

605
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,739
He knows dope,
but he's together.

606
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:58,727
He's a stand up guy, all around.

607
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:00,677
That's Abruzzo

608
00:48:00,941 --> 00:48:02,589
with the two black fat ones.

609
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:05,501
He loves a big ass, man.

610
00:48:07,341 --> 00:48:08,686
He's a bulldog.

611
00:48:09,243 --> 00:48:11,889
He don't fuck around,
he got a bit of a temper yeah, but,

612
00:48:12,149 --> 00:48:14,403
you could trust this guy
with your grandma.

613
00:48:14,908 --> 00:48:15,917
Listen.

614
00:48:16,246 --> 00:48:19,170
We work together. You want me,
you got to take them, too.

615
00:48:31,824 --> 00:48:32,961
When do we start?

616
00:48:36,072 --> 00:48:37,328
<i>The man I worked for</i>

617
00:48:37,486 --> 00:48:41,268
ran one of the biggest companies
in New York City for more than 50 years.

618
00:48:41,965 --> 00:48:43,290
15 years,

619
00:48:43,595 --> 00:48:45,337
8 months and 9 days

620
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:47,153
I was with him every day,

621
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,029
protected him, looked after him.
I learned from him.

622
00:48:51,907 --> 00:48:54,169
Bumpy was rich,
but wasn't white man rich.

623
00:48:54,372 --> 00:48:55,648
He wasn't wealthy.

624
00:48:56,219 --> 00:48:58,298
He didnt own his own company.
He thought he did.

625
00:48:58,490 --> 00:48:59,693
He just managed it.

626
00:49:00,174 --> 00:49:01,926
White men owned it,
so they owned him.

627
00:49:02,754 --> 00:49:04,060
Nobody owns me though.

628
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:05,830
- How you doin, babe?
- Good.

629
00:49:06,272 --> 00:49:09,057
Cause I own my own company,
and my company sells a product

630
00:49:09,254 --> 00:49:11,203
thats better than the competitions.

631
00:49:12,261 --> 00:49:14,714
At a price thats lower
than the competitions.

632
00:49:16,102 --> 00:49:17,442
What are we selling here?

633
00:49:33,383 --> 00:49:34,527
How you doin, Red?

634
00:49:35,423 --> 00:49:37,332
My brothers,
just got here from North Carolina,

635
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,753
Guys, this is Redtop.

636
00:49:39,672 --> 00:49:41,174
- How you doin?
- And the ladies.

637
00:49:41,337 --> 00:49:42,487
Nice family.

638
00:49:42,721 --> 00:49:44,949
What? Ya'll niggas
never seen hoochie before?

639
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:46,991
Why they all naked?

640
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:48,712
So they can steal nothin.

641
00:49:51,592 --> 00:49:54,106
Most important thing in business
is honesty.

642
00:49:54,582 --> 00:49:56,045
Integrity, hard work.

643
00:49:57,447 --> 00:49:58,454
Family.

644
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:01,377
Never forgetting
where we came from.

645
00:50:01,884 --> 00:50:03,092
Thank you, Charlene.

646
00:50:08,525 --> 00:50:10,708
See, you are what you are
in this world.

647
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:13,591
That's either one of two things.

648
00:50:15,266 --> 00:50:16,799
Either you're somebody.

649
00:50:18,206 --> 00:50:20,137
Or nobody.
I'll be right back.

650
00:50:36,497 --> 00:50:37,603
I need this fresh,

651
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,913
cause if I come back here,
you'll know what it is.

652
00:50:40,123 --> 00:50:41,687
- You don't play that.
- I hear you,

653
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:44,459
you won't have to come back.
There will be no problem.

654
00:50:45,523 --> 00:50:46,571
Where's my money?

655
00:50:46,774 --> 00:50:49,259
Redtop gave you the package,
you supposed to hand me my money.

656
00:50:49,462 --> 00:50:51,205
Here's a jar right here.
20 %.

657
00:50:51,461 --> 00:50:53,126
- You got the jar?
- That's right.

658
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:55,960
Get the fuck outa here...

659
00:50:56,223 --> 00:50:58,337
What you gonna do?
What the fuck you gonna do?

660
00:50:59,651 --> 00:51:00,666
What you doin?

661
00:51:00,889 --> 00:51:02,818
You wanna shoot me,
in front of everybody?

662
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,106
Huh? Come on!

663
00:51:06,886 --> 00:51:07,927
Shit.

664
00:51:20,137 --> 00:51:21,176
Here you go.

665
00:51:21,822 --> 00:51:22,843
20 %.

666
00:51:46,593 --> 00:51:48,083
So, what was I sayin?

667
00:51:58,817 --> 00:52:02,083
This is the newly formed
Essex County narcotics squad.

668
00:52:03,551 --> 00:52:07,337
Our mandate is to make major arrests.
No street guys.

669
00:52:08,276 --> 00:52:10,911
We're looking for the suppliers
and the distributors.

670
00:52:11,431 --> 00:52:13,092
Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines.

671
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:15,997
No grass under 1,000 pounds.
No powder under 40 kilos.

672
00:52:16,373 --> 00:52:18,395
Less than that,
someone else can waste their time.

673
00:52:18,598 --> 00:52:20,696
We'll be handling big shipments,
big money,

674
00:52:20,923 --> 00:52:22,140
and big temptation.

675
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:24,286
I heard a story about you.
That you found

676
00:52:24,565 --> 00:52:27,595
a million $ in unmarked cash.
And you gave that shit back.

677
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:29,119
Is that true?

678
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:31,792
Yeah, I did.
Anyone got a problem with that?

679
00:52:37,186 --> 00:52:39,153
So do I.
I think about it everyday.

680
00:52:39,347 --> 00:52:42,362
I should be down in Florida with
a 68 full cruiser dual, fishing sharks.

681
00:52:42,507 --> 00:52:44,096
- You and me both.
- But you know...

682
00:52:44,279 --> 00:52:46,266
I didn't, so here I am, and...

683
00:52:47,782 --> 00:52:49,636
We'll try to land
some other kinda sharks.

684
00:53:16,952 --> 00:53:18,368
- All right?
- Bingo.

685
00:53:42,233 --> 00:53:43,233
See that?

686
00:53:44,598 --> 00:53:46,486
And this stuff is everyday's stuff.

687
00:53:47,353 --> 00:53:48,748
But this Blue Magic,

688
00:53:48,931 --> 00:53:50,291
twice the potency.

689
00:53:50,608 --> 00:53:52,853
The purest thing
I've ever seen in the street.

690
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:54,789
Strong enough to smoke.

691
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:58,013
That's for those suburban
white kids scared of needles.

692
00:53:58,426 --> 00:54:00,009
You paid 10 bucks for that?

693
00:54:00,277 --> 00:54:02,708
And it's everywhere,
on every corner.

694
00:54:02,926 --> 00:54:04,495
So how's that possible?

695
00:54:04,979 --> 00:54:08,163
Who can afford to sell shit
twice as good for half as much?

696
00:54:16,535 --> 00:54:19,084
Hey man, good to see you!

697
00:54:19,421 --> 00:54:21,127
- Doin good?
- Yeah, just got back

698
00:54:21,333 --> 00:54:22,933
from a trip to the south of France.

699
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:39,458
Know what I'm sayin?

700
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:42,166
Here you go!

701
00:54:46,974 --> 00:54:48,193
Who is that?

702
00:54:59,632 --> 00:55:01,139
Ladies and gentlemen.

703
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,765
The Proud Bomber, the champ.

704
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:05,947
Mr. Joe Louis!

705
00:55:15,093 --> 00:55:16,448
Who's that with Joe?

706
00:55:16,908 --> 00:55:18,177
Miss Puerto Rico.

707
00:55:19,006 --> 00:55:20,064
Puerto Rico?

708
00:55:20,839 --> 00:55:23,519
- She a beauty queen.
- Real. The beauty queen.

709
00:55:49,969 --> 00:55:51,350
My main man.

710
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:58,283
Excuse us for a minute, please.

711
00:55:58,439 --> 00:55:59,616
Sure, Frank.

712
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:03,109
Thank you.

713
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:08,526
What's goin on?

714
00:56:08,737 --> 00:56:09,970
What you smiling about?

715
00:56:10,136 --> 00:56:11,517
- I dunno.
- What is this?

716
00:56:11,886 --> 00:56:12,982
What's what?

717
00:56:13,366 --> 00:56:14,684
- What?
- Come here.

718
00:56:17,013 --> 00:56:18,215
What's that you wearin?

719
00:56:18,457 --> 00:56:19,613
What's what?

720
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:21,951
That, what you got on?

721
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,805
A very, very, very nice suit.

722
00:56:23,986 --> 00:56:25,376
Very, very nice suit, huh?

723
00:56:25,557 --> 00:56:27,259
That's a clown suit,
a costume, man,

724
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,608
with a big sign that says:
"Arrest me".

725
00:56:29,882 --> 00:56:32,357
Understand? You too loud,
you're making too much noise.

726
00:56:32,547 --> 00:56:34,638
Look at me.
The loudest one in the room

727
00:56:35,123 --> 00:56:37,763
is the weakest one in the room,
I tell you that.

728
00:56:38,555 --> 00:56:41,448
- You tryin to be like Nicky Barnes?
- What's the problem with him?

729
00:56:41,655 --> 00:56:43,799
- I like him.
- I got no problem. You like him?

730
00:56:44,153 --> 00:56:46,081
You wanna be like him?
You wanna be Superfly?

731
00:56:46,401 --> 00:56:47,795
You wanna work for him?

732
00:56:47,983 --> 00:56:49,709
Share a jail cell with him?
Cook for him?

733
00:56:49,871 --> 00:56:52,985
- He wants to talk to you.
- So, you talkin to him about me now?

734
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,513
What about?

735
00:56:54,649 --> 00:56:56,326
- It ain't like that.
- Then what is it?

736
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:58,381
- Your name came up.
- About what?

737
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:01,280
I don't know, I told him I'd tell you.

738
00:57:03,688 --> 00:57:04,978
You know, boy...

739
00:57:07,183 --> 00:57:09,562
If you wasn't my bro', I'd kill you.
You know that?

740
00:57:09,714 --> 00:57:11,727
I'd blow your fuckin brains out.

741
00:57:11,893 --> 00:57:14,208
- Don't be like that.
- I'm taking you shoppin this week.

742
00:57:14,353 --> 00:57:15,897
- I can do it alone.
- I can tell.

743
00:57:49,984 --> 00:57:51,368
You still owe me that dance.

744
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:52,667
Doc, come on.

745
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,149
Frank.

746
00:57:54,718 --> 00:57:55,733
Check this.

747
00:58:06,263 --> 00:58:07,705
- How you doing?
- Hi.

748
00:58:08,027 --> 00:58:09,979
- Frank Lucas.
- Eva Jendo.

749
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:11,978
Nice to meet you, Eva.

750
00:58:12,262 --> 00:58:13,805
Nice to meet you, Frank.

751
00:58:15,055 --> 00:58:16,872
You're Frank,
and this is your place.

752
00:58:17,206 --> 00:58:19,613
That's right, I'm Frank
and this is my place.

753
00:58:25,817 --> 00:58:27,462
Why is it called Small's?

754
00:58:27,807 --> 00:58:29,235
Why not Frank's?

755
00:58:31,025 --> 00:58:33,211
When you own something,
you call it what you want.

756
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,682
Small's.

757
00:58:36,203 --> 00:58:37,360
Or Frank's.

758
00:58:37,882 --> 00:58:39,007
Frankie Small's.

759
00:58:39,344 --> 00:58:40,380
Small's Frankie.

760
00:58:42,325 --> 00:58:43,363
That's right.

761
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:45,816
You want to let my hand go?

762
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:49,010
Okay.

763
00:58:50,404 --> 00:58:51,509
You're leaving?

764
00:58:51,793 --> 00:58:53,296
No, I was going to my table.

765
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:55,306
You need someone to go with you?

766
00:58:57,939 --> 00:58:58,995
Yes?

767
00:59:05,476 --> 00:59:07,225
Wash your hand?
I got one print of that.

768
00:59:07,398 --> 00:59:08,576
You'll smudge it.

769
00:59:10,543 --> 00:59:12,573
- Here you go.
- What about him?

770
00:59:12,754 --> 00:59:14,231
- Who's that?
- Joey Sadano.

771
00:59:14,383 --> 00:59:15,729
Don Cattano's nephew.

772
00:59:16,193 --> 00:59:18,813
- Put him up there by the big man
- He looks like you, Abruzzo.

773
00:59:18,959 --> 00:59:20,010
- Not as handsome.

774
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,468
- Looks more like your sister.
- Where's Ice Pick Paul?

775
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,762
Funny. You guys should
take that show on the road.

776
00:59:25,097 --> 00:59:26,769
So we need...
Ice Pick Paul.

777
00:59:28,771 --> 00:59:29,831
There you go.

778
00:59:31,278 --> 00:59:32,696
He goes near the top.

779
00:59:33,258 --> 00:59:36,246
No, Ice Pick Paul is a soldier,
this guy is a lieutenant.

780
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:38,597
"...you have passed the
New Jersey Bar Examination."

781
00:59:40,584 --> 00:59:42,056
That guy is a soldier.

782
00:59:42,218 --> 00:59:44,170
This guy's a lieutenant.
No way he's on top.

783
00:59:44,332 --> 00:59:46,647
You're thinking Benny the Bishop.
Benny Two Socks,

784
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:49,785
- Cattano's deadbeat son-in-law.
- Jonesy's right.

785
00:59:50,098 --> 00:59:53,152
Which one of you has actually seen
Ice Pick Paul selling drugs?

786
00:59:53,796 --> 00:59:54,813
Actually,

787
00:59:55,057 --> 00:59:56,950
- seen it go down?
- Yeah, seen it go down,

788
00:59:57,098 --> 00:59:59,202
been in his place,
seen him handle drugs?

789
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:00,924
That rat Rickie has told us.

790
01:00:01,387 --> 01:00:02,630
He's fuckin dead!

791
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,397
About 4 weeks ago.

792
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,019
He's dead.

793
01:00:07,268 --> 01:00:09,197
Well, we can take him
off the fuckin board.

794
01:00:09,516 --> 01:00:11,995
I don't think
we got any solid evidence

795
01:00:12,534 --> 01:00:14,127
on anybody on that board.

796
01:00:14,516 --> 01:00:17,137
What you saying?
This is weeks and weeks of work, man.

797
01:00:17,557 --> 01:00:20,389
I say take it down.
We start again from the street.

798
01:00:23,235 --> 01:00:26,007
That's considerably more
than one year's salary.

799
01:00:27,787 --> 01:00:29,098
If it disappears...

800
01:00:29,757 --> 01:00:31,602
we'll not be able
to get it for you again.

801
01:00:33,289 --> 01:00:34,467
That's yours.

802
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:36,429
Sign on my life for you again?

803
01:00:37,053 --> 01:00:38,653
For a lousy twenty grand?

804
01:00:42,034 --> 01:00:43,516
It has to be Blue Magic, OK?

805
01:00:44,102 --> 01:00:45,198
It's gonna be Blue.

806
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:48,024
- Pick it up here tomorrow.
- $ 20,000.

807
01:00:48,301 --> 01:00:49,708
Just leave it there.

808
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,663
- How did it go?
- Good.

809
01:01:08,045 --> 01:01:09,203
Here he comes.

810
01:01:09,579 --> 01:01:10,883
- That's him?
- Yeah.

811
01:01:12,207 --> 01:01:13,242
He's quick.

812
01:01:25,259 --> 01:01:28,082
- He goes into the City. What do we do?
- Stay with the fuckin money.

813
01:01:28,307 --> 01:01:29,931
We stay with the money, all right?

814
01:01:30,121 --> 01:01:31,777
- We can't go there!
- Yes, we can.

815
01:01:32,058 --> 01:01:34,128
That's 20 grand in there
that I'm responsible for.

816
01:01:34,311 --> 01:01:37,239
- I ain't losin it, follow the money!
- It's out of our jurisdiction!

817
01:01:37,503 --> 01:01:39,350
- Follow the money!
- All right!

818
01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:55,710
He's pulling over.

819
01:01:55,969 --> 01:01:57,466
All right, here we go.

820
01:01:58,092 --> 01:01:59,209
Let me out here.

821
01:02:01,779 --> 01:02:04,512
- Don't disappear, all right?
- I'll circle the block.

822
01:02:43,205 --> 01:02:44,133
Sit down!

823
01:02:46,371 --> 01:02:48,074
Happy birthday, gentlemen.
How you doin?

824
01:02:49,034 --> 01:02:51,585
<i>You're up to something, huh?
He's going bowling.</i>

825
01:02:53,472 --> 01:02:55,117
Look at that.
Right between the legs.

826
01:02:55,299 --> 01:02:56,834
- What's in the bag?
- Nothing.

827
01:02:56,996 --> 01:02:58,042
Get the fuck up!

828
01:02:58,317 --> 01:03:00,769
<i>- It's my bag.
- Shut the fuck up! What did I tell you?</i>

829
01:03:01,013 --> 01:03:02,921
<i>- Keep your your head down!
- What you doin?</i>

830
01:03:03,104 --> 01:03:05,236
<i>- Sit down and shut up!
- Don't you move!</i>

831
01:03:18,122 --> 01:03:19,129
Hey guys!

832
01:03:19,427 --> 01:03:20,662
Guys! Officers!

833
01:03:22,001 --> 01:03:23,808
I'm Richie Roberts.
Newark.

834
01:03:26,069 --> 01:03:27,206
That's... my money.

835
01:03:28,467 --> 01:03:30,337
What the fuck?
What money?

836
01:03:32,619 --> 01:03:35,086
The bills are sequenced,
they're registered with the Essex

837
01:03:35,313 --> 01:03:36,741
County Prosecutors Office.

838
01:03:36,944 --> 01:03:39,655
Check them up.
They all start with CF3500.

839
01:03:39,922 --> 01:03:40,937
Have a look.

840
01:03:45,997 --> 01:03:47,162
Fucking registers.

841
01:03:47,424 --> 01:03:50,139
I thought I had a fucking Chris-Craft
sitting in my driveway.

842
01:03:50,545 --> 01:03:51,738
Honest mistake.

843
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,444
I'll just get the money.

844
01:03:55,205 --> 01:03:56,206
This time.

845
01:04:00,335 --> 01:04:02,873
When's the last time I was in Jersey?
Let me think.

846
01:04:05,227 --> 01:04:06,276
Never.

847
01:04:08,356 --> 01:04:10,448
Whatre you doing coming over here
unannounced?

848
01:04:10,701 --> 01:04:12,706
You know you can get hurt
doing that?

849
01:04:14,663 --> 01:04:16,403
You got your fucking money.

850
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:17,628
Richie.

851
01:04:18,516 --> 01:04:19,809
And never ever

852
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,199
come into this city again unannounced.

853
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:24,672
You come in to see
a fuckin Broadway show?

854
01:04:24,964 --> 01:04:27,244
You call ahead first to see
if its okay with me.

855
01:04:29,338 --> 01:04:30,475
No problem.

856
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:37,247
- Go hit some ball.
- Great suits.

857
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,458
Is that your car?

858
01:04:42,456 --> 01:04:43,662
Fucking great car.

859
01:04:44,371 --> 01:04:46,570
Have a nice fuckin trip
back to Jersey.

860
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:48,154
All right.

861
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:50,660
Come on, I got a tea time.
Let's go.

862
01:05:03,544 --> 01:05:04,945
This is your father?

863
01:05:06,225 --> 01:05:07,943
That's Martin Luther King.

864
01:05:08,948 --> 01:05:10,798
- It is not.
- Yes, it is Martin Luther King.

865
01:05:10,971 --> 01:05:13,438
- You know, "I have a dream".
- Of course.

866
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:15,046
No, that's...

867
01:05:15,849 --> 01:05:18,123
He was just as important
as Martin Luther King.

868
01:05:18,538 --> 01:05:20,440
- To me.
- What did he do?

869
01:05:21,523 --> 01:05:24,037
A lot of things, he was a...
friend.

870
01:05:25,152 --> 01:05:27,284
Served New York,
New York served him.

871
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,834
He was my boss.

872
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:31,544
My teacher.

873
01:05:32,001 --> 01:05:33,402
What did he teach you?

874
01:05:33,681 --> 01:05:35,732
He taught me a lot of things. He...

875
01:05:37,963 --> 01:05:39,871
Taught me how to take my time.

876
01:05:41,497 --> 01:05:45,114
That if I was going to do something,
to do it with care, love.

877
01:05:46,335 --> 01:05:47,339
Anything else?

878
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:53,890
Taught me to be a gentleman.

879
01:05:54,603 --> 01:05:55,712
That's what you are?

880
01:05:55,955 --> 01:05:58,100
That's what I try to be.
Come here.

881
01:05:59,524 --> 01:06:00,803
Come sit here.

882
01:06:03,742 --> 01:06:04,798
Look at me.

883
01:06:05,986 --> 01:06:08,743
I own about five apartments
in Manhattan.

884
01:06:10,373 --> 01:06:12,955
Homes all over the East Coast.
Could've taken you to anyone of'em,

885
01:06:13,146 --> 01:06:15,272
but I didn't.
I brought you here.

886
01:06:15,929 --> 01:06:19,039
- I was looking for you, boy.
- Cause I want you to meet my mother.

887
01:06:19,479 --> 01:06:20,779
How you doin, Ma?

888
01:06:21,181 --> 01:06:22,829
- Is this her?
- Eva,

889
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,524
- this is my mother.
- Hi, Eva.

890
01:06:25,168 --> 01:06:26,433
Nice to meet you.

891
01:06:26,633 --> 01:06:27,939
She's beautiful.

892
01:06:28,606 --> 01:06:29,690
Look at her.

893
01:06:29,985 --> 01:06:31,274
She's an angel

894
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:33,175
come down from Heaven.

895
01:06:33,636 --> 01:06:34,655
Thank you.

896
01:06:42,817 --> 01:06:43,826
Mr. Roberts.

897
01:06:44,435 --> 01:06:46,108
I'm here for our appointment.

898
01:06:50,578 --> 01:06:51,974
- Morning.
- Morning.

899
01:06:54,337 --> 01:06:56,043
Sorry, our appointment?

900
01:06:56,654 --> 01:06:58,130
Child Social Services.

901
01:07:12,851 --> 01:07:14,821
She did mention your name though.

902
01:07:15,913 --> 01:07:18,532
- The stewardess?
- No, not her.

903
01:07:19,767 --> 01:07:22,451
The lady from Social Services,
she mentioned your name.

904
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:25,091
Right after she asked me

905
01:07:25,283 --> 01:07:27,415
if I associated with any criminals.

906
01:07:27,591 --> 01:07:29,406
- All right, go!
- You want to see this?

907
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:30,890
Hey, boys!

908
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:32,690
Joey!

909
01:07:33,535 --> 01:07:34,794
Get in the pool.

910
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:37,388
Come on!

911
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:44,202
How'd she get my name?

912
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,550
Laurie.

913
01:07:47,005 --> 01:07:48,887
She's been saying a lot lately.

914
01:07:50,194 --> 01:07:51,229
A lot.

915
01:07:55,267 --> 01:07:57,645
When you asked me to be
your son's godfather,

916
01:07:57,799 --> 01:07:59,464
- I took it very seriously.
- I know.

917
01:07:59,761 --> 01:08:01,082
And I appreciate that.

918
01:08:01,279 --> 01:08:03,974
And I said yes, I would take on
that responsability

919
01:08:04,261 --> 01:08:06,849
to take care of your son, if God forbid,
something happened to you.

920
01:08:07,026 --> 01:08:09,601
Jo, the things she said
to Child Social Services

921
01:08:09,762 --> 01:08:11,280
make me look really bad.

922
01:08:11,527 --> 01:08:12,397
You know.

923
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:14,628
All kinds at the house at night time,

924
01:08:14,851 --> 01:08:17,166
low life informants around.
Women...

925
01:08:17,491 --> 01:08:18,831
Old friends like me.

926
01:08:19,947 --> 01:08:21,486
Old friends like you, yeah.

927
01:08:23,867 --> 01:08:25,694
Uncle Joey!
Watch me!

928
01:08:29,717 --> 01:08:30,834
I understand.

929
01:08:31,101 --> 01:08:33,618
They ask me, I'll tell them
what you want me to tell.

930
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,830
- I'll lie for you.
- Don't lie.

931
01:08:36,123 --> 01:08:37,321
You don't have to lie.

932
01:08:37,554 --> 01:08:40,356
Just... omit certain details.

933
01:08:41,243 --> 01:08:42,441
Sure, all right.

934
01:08:45,433 --> 01:08:47,423
I have something else to ask you.

935
01:08:47,685 --> 01:08:50,041
You don't have to answer
if you don't want.

936
01:08:52,975 --> 01:08:54,031
Blue Magic.

937
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:55,375
Anything?

938
01:08:56,970 --> 01:09:00,706
A lot of sorrow, misery from guys
getting put out of work. That's all.

939
01:09:02,883 --> 01:09:04,172
What, your guys?

940
01:09:04,744 --> 01:09:05,723
His guys.

941
01:09:07,129 --> 01:09:09,024
You know where it's comin from?

942
01:09:10,088 --> 01:09:12,333
Guys down south,
that's all I heard.

943
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:14,786
- Cubans?
- I dunno.

944
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:17,256
Or Mexico?

945
01:09:18,004 --> 01:09:19,060
Don't know.

946
01:09:19,676 --> 01:09:21,849
You're telling me
it's from South America?

947
01:09:22,029 --> 01:09:23,066
I don't know!

948
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:28,211
Whoever it is, they're upsetting
the natural order of things.

949
01:09:29,388 --> 01:09:30,525
That's all there is.

950
01:09:46,712 --> 01:09:48,205
- What's up?
- <i>My man.</i>

951
01:09:48,497 --> 01:09:49,507
<i>How's it lookin?</i>

952
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:20,614
I want you to meet Mike Sobota.

953
01:11:20,966 --> 01:11:22,448
- How're you doing?
- How're you?

954
01:11:22,631 --> 01:11:24,806
- What can I get you?
- A left hander, Charlie told me

955
01:11:24,965 --> 01:11:26,427
- about your nephew.
- Oh, Mr...

956
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:28,864
- Yankees.
- Yeah, yeah! Hey, Steve!

957
01:11:29,181 --> 01:11:30,476
- Come here.
- Excuse me.

958
01:11:30,638 --> 01:11:33,247
He's good. Put him in the team.
You're good enough, right?

959
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,943
I'm a Lucas.
Good enough on a bad day.

960
01:11:36,144 --> 01:11:38,964
So don't make it a bad day,
make it a good day, you understand?

961
01:11:40,498 --> 01:11:43,320
Excuse me. Police department.
Now back out, baby.

962
01:11:46,838 --> 01:11:48,219
I'll take your ass in, Jimmy.

963
01:11:48,635 --> 01:11:50,381
You can't take me in for that.

964
01:11:50,943 --> 01:11:52,839
I got a licence for that, motherfucker.

965
01:11:53,504 --> 01:11:55,681
You got a licence for this?
Excuse me, all right?

966
01:11:58,571 --> 01:11:59,801
Shit, all right!

967
01:12:01,361 --> 01:12:03,788
I got to arrest you.
Shit's too good to be on the street.

968
01:12:04,963 --> 01:12:07,300
- What you doin, man?
- You ain't arresting nobody.

969
01:12:07,778 --> 01:12:09,316
You bribing me now?

970
01:12:09,724 --> 01:12:13,215
I tell you what,
I'm arresting everybody. All of you.

971
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:14,663
You first!

972
01:12:19,588 --> 01:12:21,849
- How can that be?
- What was that?

973
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:24,091
Get this fuckin...
what's the matter with you?

974
01:12:24,307 --> 01:12:25,639
- What was that?
- What?

975
01:12:25,935 --> 01:12:28,824
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- What's your fuckin problem?

976
01:12:33,967 --> 01:12:35,366
I just shot him in the leg.

977
01:12:35,834 --> 01:12:36,869
Damn, Jimmy!

978
01:12:38,499 --> 01:12:39,535
Get up!

979
01:12:53,459 --> 01:12:54,693
Everybody, get out!

980
01:12:55,021 --> 01:12:56,091
Get out!

981
01:12:57,436 --> 01:13:00,062
- Frank, it was an accident.
- Wasn't no goddamn accident.

982
01:13:00,488 --> 01:13:03,360
He don't feel shit cause he's coked up
all the motherfuckin time!

983
01:13:04,253 --> 01:13:06,165
He's your driver,
get rid of him.

984
01:13:06,455 --> 01:13:07,655
He's your cousin!

985
01:13:07,837 --> 01:13:09,568
He ain't shit to me,
he means nothin.

986
01:13:09,741 --> 01:13:12,116
- What'll he do, go back home?
- I don't give a damn!

987
01:13:12,344 --> 01:13:13,424
Send his ass home!

988
01:13:14,446 --> 01:13:16,415
Don't rub on that.
You'd block that.

989
01:13:16,697 --> 01:13:20,394
You understand?
That's alpaga, $25,000 alpaga.

990
01:13:20,586 --> 01:13:23,668
You'd block that shit.
Don't rub, put club soda on it.

991
01:13:25,773 --> 01:13:27,016
Listen, from now on,

992
01:13:27,231 --> 01:13:29,220
don't nobody talk to me directly,
understand?

993
01:13:29,403 --> 01:13:30,711
You got business with me,

994
01:13:30,934 --> 01:13:33,095
you talk to Huey,
Huey talks to me, got it?

995
01:13:33,307 --> 01:13:35,715
- All right.
- Never on the phone, got it?

996
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:39,245
And take them
goddamn sunglasses off!

997
01:13:39,566 --> 01:13:42,247
- Take the goddamn sunglasses off!
- Damn it, man!

998
01:13:45,385 --> 01:13:47,402
Simple-minded ass motherfuckers.

999
01:14:03,006 --> 01:14:04,777
The whole place was imported

1000
01:14:05,929 --> 01:14:07,147
brick by brick.

1001
01:14:08,536 --> 01:14:09,612
Gloucestershire.

1002
01:14:10,849 --> 01:14:12,649
- Who?
- Quite famous.

1003
01:14:13,633 --> 01:14:14,648
Yours.

1004
01:14:19,809 --> 01:14:20,819
Here you go.

1005
01:14:25,937 --> 01:14:26,992
Pull!

1006
01:14:32,559 --> 01:14:33,630
Come, Eva.

1007
01:14:35,206 --> 01:14:37,947
I'm sure you're dying to see
the rest of the house.

1008
01:14:41,857 --> 01:14:43,816
Of course. Excuse me.

1009
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:48,327
Thank you for a wonderful lunch.
It was delicious.

1010
01:14:52,290 --> 01:14:54,178
What do you think of monopolies?

1011
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,266
- You mean, like the game?
- No, I just think

1012
01:14:58,608 --> 01:15:00,798
monopolies are made illegal
in the country, Frank,

1013
01:15:00,986 --> 01:15:02,901
cause no one wants to compete.

1014
01:15:03,219 --> 01:15:05,974
Nobody wants to compete,
not with a monopoly.

1015
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:07,932
Let the dairy farmers do that,

1016
01:15:09,214 --> 01:15:11,213
half of them'd
go out of business tomorrow.

1017
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:14,142
- Im just trying to make a living.
- It's your right.

1018
01:15:14,851 --> 01:15:16,887
Everybody's right. It's America.

1019
01:15:17,709 --> 01:15:21,201
We just can't do it
at the unreasonable expense of others.

1020
01:15:22,353 --> 01:15:24,221
Cause it becomes un-American.

1021
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:26,613
That's why the price we pay
for that gallon of milk

1022
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:28,687
never represents the true cost
of production

1023
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:31,287
cause it's gotta be controlled.
It's gotta be set.

1024
01:15:31,828 --> 01:15:32,885
It's gotta be fair.

1025
01:15:33,078 --> 01:15:35,464
Controlled by who?
I set a price I think is fair.

1026
01:15:35,627 --> 01:15:37,175
- I don't think it is.
- You don't?

1027
01:15:37,338 --> 01:15:38,333
I don't.

1028
01:15:38,515 --> 01:15:40,613
I know your customers
are happy, Frank.

1029
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:43,104
Bunch of fuckin junkies
that they are.

1030
01:15:43,591 --> 01:15:45,765
What about your fellow dairy farmers?

1031
01:15:46,738 --> 01:15:48,148
Are you thinking of us?

1032
01:15:48,871 --> 01:15:50,254
You thinking of them?

1033
01:15:50,807 --> 01:15:52,127
The dairy farmers?

1034
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:56,692
I'm thinking of them, Dominic, about
as much as they've thought about me.

1035
01:15:57,646 --> 01:15:59,256
I'm just thinking out loud.

1036
01:16:00,626 --> 01:16:02,762
If you took some of your inventory,

1037
01:16:03,342 --> 01:16:05,027
and you sold it wholesale.

1038
01:16:06,867 --> 01:16:09,642
Sit.
We could work.

1039
01:16:10,535 --> 01:16:12,342
You could use some distribution.

1040
01:16:13,604 --> 01:16:16,780
I dunno, I'm pretty good.
I got 110th to 155th,

1041
01:16:17,045 --> 01:16:18,568
river to river, I'm all right.

1042
01:16:19,019 --> 01:16:21,991
It's kind of a mom and pop store
next to what Im talking about,

1043
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:23,859
and that's bigger than K-Mart.

1044
01:16:24,026 --> 01:16:26,889
I'm talking about L.A.,
Chicago, Detroit, Las Vegas.

1045
01:16:27,158 --> 01:16:28,620
Let's go nationwide.

1046
01:16:29,272 --> 01:16:31,729
I'm gonna guarantee you
peace of mind here.

1047
01:16:32,303 --> 01:16:33,620
You don't want that?

1048
01:16:34,871 --> 01:16:36,252
You gonna need it.

1049
01:16:37,056 --> 01:16:38,687
I don't know how you feel me.

1050
01:16:38,918 --> 01:16:40,705
I'm kind of a Renaissance man.

1051
01:16:40,901 --> 01:16:42,729
The people I deal with on a daily basis,

1052
01:16:42,962 --> 01:16:44,751
they're not enlightened.

1053
01:16:45,012 --> 01:16:47,428
You talk to them about civil rights,
they don't know.

1054
01:16:47,654 --> 01:16:48,994
They're not open to change.

1055
01:16:49,452 --> 01:16:52,132
Not from the way things are done,
and who's doing it.

1056
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:55,994
I can talk to them,
so there's no misunderstanding.

1057
01:16:57,964 --> 01:17:00,746
That's what I mean
by peace of mind.

1058
01:17:03,423 --> 01:17:04,432
Here

1059
01:17:05,523 --> 01:17:08,069
You're paying what,
75, 80 thousand a kilo?

1060
01:17:10,912 --> 01:17:12,639
I'm a Renaissance man too.

1061
01:17:14,141 --> 01:17:15,704
I'd consider 50,000.
