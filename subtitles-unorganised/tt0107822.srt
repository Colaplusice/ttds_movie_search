00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,480
<i>'The voice you hear
is not my speaking voice...</i>

2
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,920
<i>'but my mind's voice.</i>

3
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,960
<i>'I have not spoken
since I was six years old.</i>

4
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,560
<i>'No-one knows why. Not even me.</i>

5
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,440
<i>'My father says
it is a dark talent,</i>

6
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,880
<i>'and the day I take it into my head
to stop breathing will be my last.</i>

7
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,400
<i>'Today, he married me
to a man I've not yet met.</i>

8
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,400
<i>'Soon, my daughter and I
shall join him in his own country.</i>

9
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,800
<i>'My husband said
my muteness does not bother him.</i>

10
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,160
<i>'He writes, and hark this, God
loves dumb creatures so why not he!</i>

11
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,280
<i>'Were good he had God's patience...</i>

12
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,960
<i>'for silence
affects everyone in the end.</i>

13
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,440
<i>'The strange thing is
I don't think myself silent.</i>

14
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,320
<i>'That is because of my piano.</i>

15
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,200
<i>'I shall miss it on the journey.'</i>

16
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,560
Take her hand, come on.

17
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,800
You're with me.

18
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,040
I've got the lady.

19
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,680
You go ahead.

20
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,360
Paddington Station.

21
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,360
Over here, my lovely!

22
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,120
All right, lads, unbutton your muftis.

23
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,360
Piss like a tom.

24
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,720
Jesus Christ,
whose bloody coffin is this?

25
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,960
Christ, it's heavy!
Hold it!

26
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,480
Fuck them. Well, just leave them behind.
It's what they fucking want.

27
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,320
Aye, very good. Leave them
and be lynched for the pleasure!

28
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,720
It's a bit rough out there. Could be they
can't get through you in this weather.

29
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,560
Do you have things for shelter?

30
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,800
She says, "Thank you."

31
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,800
Does your mother prefer
to come on with us to Nelson?

32
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:34,720
She says, "No." She says, she'd rather be boiled
alive by natives than get back in your tub.

33
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,960
You be damn fortuned I don't smack
your puppy gob, young missy!

34
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,360
Damn lucky!

35
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,360
We're all ready now, sir.

36
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,680
Mother, watch out!

37
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,320
The hens! Are they all right? Here.

38
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,920
Look, I'm a very big moth.

39
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,680
Will it catch fire?

40
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,920
I'm not gonna call him Papa.
I'm not gonna call him anything.

41
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm not even going to look at him.

42
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,480
Are we stopping?

43
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,920
Shall we stop?

44
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,000
We must get on.

45
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,560
Miss McGrath? Alisdair Stewart.

46
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,640
You'll have to wake yourselves.
I've got men here to carry your things.

47
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,920
Well, I see you've got a good many boxes.

48
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,120
I'd like to know what's in each...

49
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,440
Can you hear me?

50
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,960
Well, that's good.
Yes, that's good.

51
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,760
What's in this one?

52
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,160
You're small.
I never thought you'd be small.

53
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,400
And this one? This is very large.

54
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,440
- What's in it, then, a bedstead?
- It's my mother's piano.

55
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,440
Baines, tell them to carry in pairs.

56
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,600
Take all the boxes, table
and the suitcases.

57
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,080
What do you think?

58
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,440
She looks tired.

59
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,760
She's stunted, that's one thing.

60
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,160
And the big case?

61
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,360
No, no. Just the trunks
and the boxes as I explained.

62
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,680
- No, it can't come now.
- It must. She wants it to come.

63
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,080
Yes, so do I. But there are too few
of us here to carry it now.

64
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,400
Too heavy!

65
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,920
What, you mean you don't want your
clothing or kitchenware to come?

66
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,680
Is that what you mean?

67
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,720
We can't leave the piano!

68
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,960
Let's not discuss this any further.
I'm very pleased that you arrived safely.

69
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,120
But we must know if they can
come back directly for it.

70
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,080
Could I apologise for the delay...

71
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,920
After they've taken the other things.

72
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,440
Might I suggest that you prepare
yourself for a difficult journey.

73
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,400
The bush will tear clothing, and
the mud is very deep in places.

74
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,840
What do they think they're doing?
We don't have time for this.

75
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,120
What's the matter?
Why are they stopping?

76
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,160
That's the way to the
burial grounds. It's tapu.

77
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,000
They want more money. They're
trying to make two days out of it.

78
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,400
No.

79
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,760
No, they know another track
to the side of this.

80
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,640
Septimus, now take that off!

81
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,600
Take that off!

82
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,520
Watch your feet! Mind your feet!

83
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,800
- Septimus! Please stop it!
- Stop it!

84
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,960
- Stop, please! You'll tear it!
- Oh, the tag is broken.

85
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,440
Septimus, now stop!

86
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,480
You'll tear it. Be careful.

87
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,720
Arm down.

88
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,360
If you cannot have a ceremony together...

89
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,760
...you'll have at least a photograph.

90
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,320
Careful. The lace is most fragile.

91
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,560
My real father was
a famous German composer.

92
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,240
They met when my mother was
an opera singer in Luxembourg.

93
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,560
Why?

94
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,600
I want to be in the photograph.

95
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,760
Going to leave the cloth here?

96
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,800
No, no. It is just to keep
the chair dry.

97
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,520
We must have slipped on the planks.
They have gotten very greasy.

98
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,880
Get in that chair.

99
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,080
Pull the tarpaulin off.

100
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,720
I am sorry it rained.
We have not light enough inside.

101
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,160
- Shall I have the umbrella on this side on t'other?
- On t'other! On t'other!

102
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,560
Can you take this, please?

103
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,600
And sitting...

104
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,840
...very still.

105
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,400
And where did they get married?

106
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,320
In an enormous forest
with fairies as bridesmaids...

107
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,160
...each holding a little elf's hand.

108
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,920
No, I tell a lie. It was in a small
country church in the mountains.

109
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,040
- Which mountains are those, dear?
- The Pyrenees.

110
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,200
I've never been there.

111
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,240
Mother used to sing songs in German,
and her voice echoed across the valleys.

112
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,080
- That was before the accident.
- And what happened?

113
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,000
One day, while my mother and father
were singing together in the forest...

114
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,320
...a great storm blew up.

115
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,120
But, so passionate was the singing...

116
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,840
...that they didn't notice.
They didn't stop as rain began to fall.

117
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,240
And when their voices rose for the final bars
of the duet, a great bold of lightning...

118
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,840
...came out of the sky and struck my
father, who lit up like a torch.

119
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,840
At the same moment my father
was struck dead...

120
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,880
...my mother was struck dumb.
She never spoke another word.

121
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,960
Oh, dear!

122
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,920
Not another word?

123
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,640
Well, from the shock. Yes.

124
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,560
It would be. Terrible.

125
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,920
Terrible.

126
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Terrible, terrible.

127
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,160
Sorry.

128
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,920
I have to go away for some days.

129
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,480
Some Maori land I'm interested in
which I may buy very reasonably.

130
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,600
Well, I hope you'll spend the time
to get settled in. And perhaps...

131
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,360
...in some ways...

132
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,920
...we could start again.

133
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,680
All right?

134
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,080
I'm not able to read.

135
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,480
Please take us back to
the beach where we landed.

136
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,640
I am sorry. I can't do that.

137
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,880
I don't have the time.

138
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,240
Goodbye.

139
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,920
I can't take you there.

140
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,640
I can't do it.

141
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,760
Mumma! Mumma, watch me! Look!

142
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,360
Mumma! Mumma!

143
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,800
- Hello, there.
- Hello.

144
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,840
Well, you've stopped combing your hair which
is a good thing. It was looking overdone.

145
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,520
You see, these're the slits
of the heads will go through.

146
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,560
Show him, Nessie.

147
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,440
The Reverend's going to use animal blood.
No doubt it'll be very dramatic.

148
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,520
- Very dramatic.
- Tea!

149
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,480
Morag...

150
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,520
...what would you think if someone...

151
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,280
...were to play a kitchen table?

152
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,080
Like it were a piano.

153
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,720
Like it were a piano?

154
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,920
It's strange, isn't it?
I mean, it's not a piano.

155
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,360
It doesn't make any sound.

156
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,280
Biscuits!

157
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,760
No, no sound.

158
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,680
I knew...

159
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,640
...she was mute
but now I'm thinking...

160
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,640
...perhaps it's more than that.
I wonder if she's not brain-affected.

161
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,960
Shush!

162
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,480
- No sound at all?
- No. It was a table.

163
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:10,280
Well, she was very violent with the gown.
She tore off a chunk of lace.

164
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,920
I've had been here to see it. I'd have sworn you
she'd have used her teeth and wiped her feet on it.

165
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,440
It hasn't come to anything yet.
It's simply a concern, that's all.

166
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,760
Yes.

167
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,400
Yes, of course. A concern.

168
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,640
There's something
to be said for silence.

169
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,280
Indeed. Cotton?

170
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,360
With time, I'm sure
she'll become affectionate.

171
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:48,080
Sure, there's nothing so easy to like
as a pet. And they're quite silent.

172
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,600
# The grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men #

173
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,000
# He marched them up and up
and marched them down again #

174
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,440
Those 80 acres across the stream,
what do you think of them?

175
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,120
I don't have any money.
What are you on about?

176
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,120
I'd like to make a swap.

177
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,840
- What for?
- The piano.

178
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,320
What, the piano on the beach?

179
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,760
- It's not marshy, is it?
- No.

180
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,880
Baines the music lover. I never would have
thought. Hidden talents, George?

181
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,120
I'd have to get lessons. It
wouldn't be much use without them.

182
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,880
Yes, I suppose you would.

183
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,720
Ada can play. I have it in a letter
that she plays very well.

184
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,520
She's been playing
since she was five or six.

185
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,040
What on?

186
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,400
Well, on... on your piano.
That's the swap.

187
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,280
What's she saying?

188
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,520
She says, it's her piano
and she won't have him touch it!

189
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,080
He can't read! He's ignorant!

190
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,280
He wants to improve himself,
and you'll be able to play it.

191
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,200
Teach him how to look after it!

192
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,320
You can't go on like this!

193
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,680
We're a family now. We all
make sacrifices, and so will you!

194
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,120
You will teach him,
and I will see to it!

195
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,320
A Broadwood!

196
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,880
A fine instrument!

197
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,080
I've not seen one here...

198
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,160
...nor in New South Wales
where I've tuned 200.

199
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,720
They like their pianos there.

200
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,160
Scent?

201
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,440
And salt, of course.

202
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,840
Mother says she can't stand to
teach piano with it out of tune.

203
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,200
So, I'm to do scales.

204
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,280
I hope you've scrubbed your hands.

205
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,080
It's in tune.

206
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,000
It's in tune.

207
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
I was teaching!

208
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,160
Mom would like to see what you can play.

209
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,760
I'd rather not play.

210
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,320
I want to listen, and learn that way.

211
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,800
Everyone has to practise.

212
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,840
I just want to listen.

213
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,120
Lovely.

214
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,440
Oh, but tell me again.

215
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,000
Was he your teacher?

216
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,160
How did you speak to him?

217
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,520
What happened?
Why didn't you get married?

218
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,920
Shall I kiss you good night?

219
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,760
Get out! You need a bath!

220
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,320
Out! Bad dog!

221
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,360
Move! Go on!

222
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,480
Bad bloody dog!

223
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,320
Ada, wait. Wait.

224
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,520
Do you know how to bargain?

225
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,160
There's a way
you could have your piano back.

226
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,000
Do you want it back?

227
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,960
You want it back?

228
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,560
You see...

229
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,720
I'd like us to make a deal.

230
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,520
There's things I'd...

231
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,960
...like to do while you play.

232
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,440
If you let me,
you can earn it back.

233
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,480
What do you think?
One visit for every key.

234
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,480
Your dress?

235
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,880
Skirt?

236
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,160
For every black one?

237
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,640
That's a lot less. Half.

238
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:12,360
All right, all right.
Then the black keys.

239
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,520
Poor baby!

240
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,840
What horrid little person
put you in the rain...

241
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,320
...and shoved you with a stick?

242
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,600
Hmm, baby? Huh?

243
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,480
You're all right with moi.

244
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,400
Scissors.

245
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,040
Thank you.

246
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,080
Nessie! Put that down
and come and put your hand out.

247
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,240
Oh, no. Use Mr. Stewart.

248
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,080
- No, no, no. Go on, Nessie.
- Nessie, please!

249
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,160
All right, Mary, come along.
Down here.

250
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,280
- Come on, girl.
- All right, then!

251
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,040
Down here. Put out your hand.

252
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,480
Now.

253
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,560
No, no. Put out your hand. Here.

254
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,440
Now.

255
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,680
Look, look! You're being attacked.

256
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,440
No, there you go.

257
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,360
With the blood,
it will be a very good effect!

258
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,200
Here, Flynn!

259
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,600
Flynn, Flynn, Flynn!

260
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,680
Flynn, Flynn! Bad boy!

261
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,920
Bad, bad boy!

262
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,040
Flynn, you want to be in trouble?

263
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,200
Flynn! Flynn!

264
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,600
I want to speak to my mother.

265
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,120
I don't want to be outside.
I want to watch.

266
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,640
I'll be very quiet!

267
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,760
I won't look at him!

268
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,840
- Be very careful.
- Careful.

269
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:14,240
I hardly need to give one to you,
but here you are, anyway.

270
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,800
Don't be late.

271
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,760
You will see that there're two times. And
since you're accompanying a performer...

272
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,400
...you will need to make the earlier time.

273
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,360
Wait!

274
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,960
How are the lessons going?

275
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,160
Is he getting on all right, then, is he?

276
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,760
She seems quietened down.
Is she more affectionate?

277
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,120
Ah, well. Slowly, slowly.

278
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,680
Lift your skirt.

279
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,680
Lift it higher.

280
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,120
Higher.

281
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,200
Higher!

282
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,280
Lift it higher.

283
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,220
You no worry, Peini.

284
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,100
- I save you.
- I have a wife.

285
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,260
I save her, too!

286
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,100
- Where's your wife?
- My wife?

287
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:09,300
She has a life of her own,
in Hull, England.

288
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:13,740
Must be ugly... for you to run away.

289
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,500
You need another wife.

290
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,860
Undo your dress.

291
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,020
I want to see your arms.

292
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,420
Play.

293
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,660
Two keys.

294
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,460
"I shall listen hard at rehearsal...

295
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:25,780
...because I live too far
to come often."

296
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,180
Which sign is the word "rehearsal"?

297
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:35,700
I can't imagine
a fate worse than being dumb.

298
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,340
To be deaf.

299
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:42,500
Aye. Deaf, too? Terrible! Awful!

300
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:47,340
To tell you the whole truth, mother
says most people speak rubbish...

301
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,300
...and it's not worth the listen.

302
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,780
Well, that is a strong opinion.

303
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:56,140
Aye. It's unholy.

304
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,600
What do they say? Are they selling?

305
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,240
Offer blankets for half the land.

306
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,880
Twelve.

307
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,600
Offer the guns, Baines.
Offer the guns.

308
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,280
What do they want the land for?
They won't do anything with it?

309
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,520
They don't cultivate it,
they don't burn it back. Nothing.

310
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,120
I mean, how do they
even know that it's theirs?

311
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,040
Thought I might as well
mark it out as we agreed.

312
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,320
Yes, why not?

313
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:07,320
Well, Ada says
you're doing well with the piano.

314
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,120
I'd like to come and hear you play.

315
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,560
- What do you play?
- Nothing just yet.

316
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,560
No?

317
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,960
Ada, four keys.

318
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,920
Why five? I just want to lie.

319
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,720
All right, all right, five.

320
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,800
# Early in the month of May #

321
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,680
# The angels were sweetly singin' #

322
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,720
# A young man on his deathbed lay #

323
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,760
# For love of Barbara Allen #

324
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,440
We're running late!

325
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:25,160
If you haven't got your lip colour on,
can you line up behind Rose, please?

326
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:29,000
- You all been to the lavatory?
- Yes!

327
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,360
I want no running on the stage!

328
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,480
They're bringing in extra chairs!

329
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,160
Do not touch the blood!

330
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,520
Look who's here?
The musical Mr. Baines!

331
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:56,200
What are you going to play for us
tonight? "Twinkle, Twinkle", George?

332
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,040
How about a little tinkle-tinkle, George?

333
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,880
Perhaps you would like to turn pages
for Nessi. She's playing for the children.

334
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,120
I'm in costume.

335
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,360
I'm very pleased
you've taken up the piano.

336
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,760
Now, where's this song?

337
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:42,600
George, excuse me.
How about "Mary Had A Little Lamb"?

338
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,760
Or a polka?
Come on, Geroge, what's it to be?

339
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,960
Fools.

340
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,560
Come on, George. Move along.

341
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,720
Ladies and gentlemen,
could you take your seats, please?

342
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,560
We're about to begin.

343
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,520
# Early in the month of May

344
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,200
# The angels were sweetly singin'

345
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,640
# A young man on his deathbed lay

346
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,480
# For love of Barbara Allen

347
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,560
# Out of there sprung a red rose full

348
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,440
# And out of it a briar

349
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,240
# Then they flew up
to the high church wall

350
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,200
# Till they could go no higher

351
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:48,320
# And then
they came in a true love's lock

352
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:53,680
# The roses and sweet briar #

353
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,280
And so the young maid came upon...

354
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,000
...each and all of
Bluebeard's missing wives.

355
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,640
Their severed heads still bleeding...

356
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,400
...their eyes still crying!

357
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,200
Slow down, Nessie. Slow down.

358
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,920
But hush!

359
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,000
Who comes?

360
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,120
I am home early, my sweet wife!

361
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,760
Where art thou?

362
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,800
Oh! Husband!

363
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,720
- What a surprise!
- Yes, wife!

364
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,040
A surprise, indeed!

365
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:43,200
- So now you know my secret!
- No! No!

366
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,440
You, the youngest...

367
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,320
...and sweetest...

368
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,480
...of all my wives...

369
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,800
- No!
- ...must be prepared...

370
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,320
...to die!

371
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,760
No! No! Wait!

372
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,240
I shall not wait!

373
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,120
Bare your neck!

374
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:39,450
Chief, I'd like to introduce you.
This is Mrs Williams...

375
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:45,570
...this is Mrs Parsons, this is
Mrs Reid, this is Miss Palmer...

376
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:48,330
...and this is Miss Kerr.

377
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,370
Very... very nice.

378
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,810
Do what you like.

379
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,850
Play what you like.

380
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:24,610
I want to lie together
without clothes on.

381
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:29,050
How many would that be?

382
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:39,570
Yes. Ten keys.

383
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,480
What the clock say, Missa Tewart?

384
01:01:55,530 --> 01:01:58,290
Never behave like that.
Never nowhere.

385
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:03,450
I'm greatly shamed!
You've shamed these trunks!

386
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:24,730
I know why Mr. Baines
can't play the piano.

387
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:29,450
You missed some here.

388
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:35,690
She never gives him a turn.
She just plays what she pleases.

389
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:39,970
And sometimes she doesn't play at all.

390
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:42,890
When's the next lesson?

391
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:45,810
Tomorrow.

392
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:25,110
I have given the piano back to you.

393
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,550
I've had enough.

394
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:35,950
The arrangement...

395
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:41,390
...is making you a whore
and me wretched.

396
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:46,670
I want you to care for me...

397
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:48,870
...but you can't.

398
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:57,430
It's yours. Leave.

399
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:01,190
Go on, go.

400
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:19,710
Stop right there!

401
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:28,830
This isn't yours. What are you
doing with the piano? Hmm?

402
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,710
He's given it to us.

403
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:34,270
Put that down. Put it down!

404
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:41,390
You're cunning, Ada.
I've seen through you.

405
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:46,030
I'm not going to lose
the land this way. Stay there!

406
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:58,790
Hori George don't wanna see nobody.
He's sick.

407
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:03,710
You got the tupeka for Hira?

408
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:06,630
No.

409
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:12,790
Baines.

410
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:16,830
Baines... Baines, look.

411
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:20,310
I don't think you should
have given up the piano.

412
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:25,470
I'll make sure you're properly
taught. Music on sheets and so on.

413
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:27,830
I don't want to learn.

414
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:31,470
- You don't want to learn?
- No.

415
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:36,790
But our bargain...

416
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:41,270
I can't afford the piano
if you mean me to pay.

417
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:44,630
No, no payment.
I have given it back.

418
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,350
I'm not sure I want it myself.

419
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:53,510
It was more to your wife that I gave it.

420
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:59,270
Oh, I see.

421
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:04,630
Well...
I expect she will appreciate it.

422
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:15,230
This is all I have.

423
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:18,550
Bring that back!

424
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:34,910
Is it all right?

425
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:39,030
Why don't you play something?

426
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,830
What will I play?

427
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:50,790
Play a jig.

428
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:54,750
- Do I know any jigs?
- Play a song then.

429
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:32,590
Why won't she play? We get the
thing back, she just wanders off.

430
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:37,710
Keep playing.

431
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:35,670
Wait! Wait!

432
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:45,030
Why? Why can't I?

433
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:54,790
I shan't practise and I don't care!

434
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:57,150
Blast and damn! Bugger her!

435
01:09:57,310 --> 01:10:00,390
Bloody... bloody... bugger her!

436
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:04,870
Let her fall face down
in boiling... bloody... mud!

437
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:09,430
Let a mad dog bite her till she bleeds!

438
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:10,790
Where is your mother?

439
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:14,230
- Where's she gone?
- TO HELL!

440
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:27,590
So, what brings you here?

441
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:33,030
Did you leave something?

442
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:36,190
I've not found anything.

443
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:44,510
Does he know something?

444
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:58,070
The piano was not harmed?

445
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:00,550
It arrived safely?

446
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:07,550
Would you like to sit?

447
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:11,150
I am going to sit.

448
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:24,270
Ada...

449
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:28,470
Ada.

450
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:32,310
I am unhappy...

451
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:39,910
...because I... want you...

452
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:44,870
...because my mind has seized on you
and can think of nothing else.

453
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:48,790
This is why I suffer.

454
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:52,430
I...

455
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:55,150
...am sick with longing.

456
01:11:55,230 --> 01:11:58,350
I don't eat. I don't sleep.

457
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:05,990
So, if you've come
with no feeling for me...

458
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:08,710
...then go.

459
01:12:15,550 --> 01:12:17,670
Go.

460
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:20,550
Go.

461
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:29,430
Get out.

462
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:33,150
Leave!

463
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:10,910
What?

464
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:14,990
Whisper it.

465
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:38,150
Now you are going I am miserable.

466
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:41,350
Why is that?

467
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:46,030
Ada, I need to know what will
you do. Will you come again?

468
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:54,710
Wait...

469
01:16:54,830 --> 01:16:58,630
I don't know what you're thinking.

470
01:16:58,790 --> 01:17:02,550
Does this mean something to you?

471
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:06,510
I already miss you.

472
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:09,630
Ada...

473
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:12,390
...do you love me?

474
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:31,510
Come tomorrow.
If you are serious, come tomorrow.

475
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:45,630
Mumma, stay still!

476
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:39,990
MUMMA! MUMMA!

477
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:44,230
THEY'RE PLAYING YOUR PIANO!

478
01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:10,470
Here, Papa.

479
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:45,390
You shouldn't have gone
up there, should you?

480
01:20:46,190 --> 01:20:49,310
I don't like it, and nor does Papa.

481
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:59,590
We can play cards if you like.

482
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:37,670
She's asleep. Look.

483
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:43,030
One night she was found
on the road to London.

484
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:47,550
Grandpa said her feet were cut very
badly. She couldn't walk for a week.

485
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:04,870
Ada.

486
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:40,790
Alisdair, is it because of our play?

487
01:23:40,910 --> 01:23:43,910
Have the natives aggressed you?

488
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:46,790
Well, I'll have to say.
You have done the wrong thing here.

489
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:49,710
You've put the latch on
the outside. You see.

490
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:53,590
Now when you close the door...

491
01:23:53,710 --> 01:23:56,310
...it will be the Maoris
that lock you in. You see.

492
01:23:56,430 --> 01:23:58,910
With the latch on that side,
you are quite trapped.

493
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:00,790
Quite trapped.

494
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:05,470
We have just come from George Baines. They
have taken him over. No wonder he is leaving.

495
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:08,430
He got in too deep with the natives.

496
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:12,350
- They sit on his floors as proud as kings...
- ...but without any shred of manners!

497
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:18,230
He's quite altered. As if they've been
trying some native witchcraft on him.

498
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:21,870
Well, tomorrow or the day after he'll be gone.

499
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:25,310
So Baines is packing up?

500
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:29,910
Well, he's nothing to pack, but he's
leaving. And it is just as well.

501
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:33,750
Nessie has foolishly grown fond of him.

502
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:36,230
We have had some tears.

503
01:24:36,350 --> 01:24:38,830
Stop it! Stop!

504
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:40,750
STOP!

505
01:24:42,430 --> 01:24:44,710
I am frightened of the way back.

506
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:48,870
We must leave in good light.
Will we be safe?

507
01:24:48,990 --> 01:24:51,310
Oh, yes. If you leave now,
I'm sure of it.

508
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:27,990
Nessie, hold this.

509
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:40,550
You know, I am thinking of the piano?

510
01:25:41,310 --> 01:25:45,870
She does not play the piano
as we do, Nessie. Up! Up!

511
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:55,430
No. She is a strange creature.
And her playing is strange...

512
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:58,270
...like a mood that passes into you.

513
01:25:58,550 --> 01:26:00,470
Up!

514
01:26:03,270 --> 01:26:07,870
Now, your playing is plain and true
and that is what I like.

515
01:26:07,990 --> 01:26:11,910
To have a sound creep
inside you is not at all pleasant.

516
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:14,950
What's that?

517
01:26:18,430 --> 01:26:20,510
It's a pigeon.

518
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:22,950
I should have waited.

519
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:20,190
I want to touch you.
Why can't I touch you?

520
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:24,150
Don't you like me?

521
01:27:56,910 --> 01:28:01,830
Come on, Lucky! Who's gonna be
my friend? I'm coming to get you!

522
01:28:19,190 --> 01:28:21,510
We must... get on.

523
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:26,790
I've decided to...

524
01:28:26,910 --> 01:28:29,190
...trust you to stay here.

525
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:32,470
You won't see Baines?

526
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:40,070
Good.

527
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,670
Good.

528
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:51,230
Perhaps with time...
you might come to like me.

529
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:56,990
Stop complaining, I said.
And be quiet.

530
01:29:57,030 --> 01:30:02,030
You just have to be naked until
I finish washing and drying your clothes.

531
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:07,390
I don't mind if you're cold.
Be quiet!

532
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:21,830
No, we're not supposed to visit him.

533
01:30:35,070 --> 01:30:36,830
What?

534
01:31:00,430 --> 01:31:04,830
# The grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men

535
01:31:04,950 --> 01:31:07,390
# He marched them up
to the top of the hill

536
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:09,870
# And marched them down again

537
01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:11,830
# And when they're up, they're up

538
01:31:11,950 --> 01:31:14,070
# And when they're down,
they're down

539
01:31:14,190 --> 01:31:20,030
# And when they're only halfway up
They're neither up nor down #

540
01:31:25,310 --> 01:31:27,710
Crooked, Mister Tewart.

541
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:29,950
Crooked.

542
01:31:34,630 --> 01:31:37,590
Mother want me to give this to Mr. Baines.

543
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:41,870
I thought maybe it was not
the proper thing to do.

544
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:45,630
- Shall I open it?
- No. Give it to me.

545
01:32:51,870 --> 01:32:54,590
Why? I trusted you!

546
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:01,670
I TRUSTED YOU! I TRUSTED YOU!
D'YOU HEAR?!

547
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:05,230
Why do you make me hurt you?!

548
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:09,150
We could be happy.

549
01:33:10,350 --> 01:33:13,070
YOU MAKE ME ANGRY! SPEAK!

550
01:33:19,470 --> 01:33:22,430
YOU LIED TO ME!

551
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:25,750
SPEAK! OR, BY GOD,
YOU WILL ANSWER FOR THIS!

552
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:50,790
DO YOU LOVE HIM?!

553
01:33:50,910 --> 01:33:52,630
DO YOU?!

554
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:57,630
- IS IT HIM YOU LOVE?!
- SHE SAYS... NO!

555
01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:03,070
MOTHER!

556
01:34:04,190 --> 01:34:06,070
MOTHER!

557
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:04,590
Mumma!

558
01:35:08,710 --> 01:35:10,390
You give this to Baines.

559
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:14,710
Tell him if he ever sees her again,
I'll take off another..

560
01:35:14,830 --> 01:35:17,910
...and another and another...

561
01:35:22,670 --> 01:35:24,670
- Mumma!
- RUN!

562
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:44,520
What has happened?

563
01:35:45,690 --> 01:35:47,170
Hush, hush!

564
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:53,020
What is it?

565
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:57,300
You are not to see her,
he'll chop her up!

566
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:04,780
What happened? Tell me.

567
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:06,700
TELL ME!

568
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:14,320
Where is she?

569
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:18,440
Ssh! Quiet down! Quiet down!
Where is she?!

570
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:20,680
HE CHOPPED IT OFF!

571
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:24,080
What did she tell him?
What did she tell him?

572
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:40,600
- I am going to crush his skull!
- NO! NO! NO!

573
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,800
He'll chop them off!

574
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:06,400
You pushed me too hard. You cannot
send love to him. You cannot do that.

575
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:12,040
Just even... even to think
about it makes me very angry.

576
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:18,680
I meant to love you.

577
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I clipped your wing, that's all.

578
01:37:24,240 --> 01:37:28,440
# We will be together #

579
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:33,320
# You will see it will be better #

580
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:37,800
Are you hot? My sweet love bird.

581
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,880
Are you feeling better?

582
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:10,080
What?

583
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:24,760
Look at you.

584
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:28,000
It's your face.

585
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:31,960
I've had that face in my head
hating it.

586
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:35,000
But now I'm here seeing it...

587
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:38,520
it's nothing.

588
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:44,640
You have your marks.
You look at me through your eyes.

589
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:48,440
You're even afraid of me.

590
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:51,800
Get up.

591
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:01,200
Baines...

592
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,600
...has Ada ever spoken to you?

593
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,480
You mean in signs?

594
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:13,320
No. Words.

595
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,600
Have you ever heard words?

596
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:19,240
No. Not words.

597
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:22,480
You never thought you heard words?

598
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:33,240
I heard it here. I heard her voice.
There in my head.

599
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:38,840
The lips didn't make the words.

600
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:44,320
But, yet, the harder I
listened... the clearer I heard her.

601
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:48,680
You punished her wrongly.
It was me... my fault.

602
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,760
She said...

603
01:41:57,480 --> 01:42:00,120
"I am afraid of my will...

604
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:05,200
...of what it might do.
It is so strange and strong."

605
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:07,240
She said...

606
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:11,720
"I have to go. Let me go.

607
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:16,760
Let Baines take me away.
Let him try and save me."

608
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:23,200
I wish her gone. I wish you gone.

609
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:29,960
I want to wake up...

610
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:33,440
...and find that this...

611
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:36,280
...was all a dream.
That's what I want.

612
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:54,480
It was a terrible shock.

613
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:57,640
Oh, dear!

614
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:25,040
No. She needs it. She must have it.

615
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:45,920
- What did she say?
- She said, "Throw the piano overboard."

616
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:49,280
It's quite safe. They are managing.

617
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:55,240
She doesn't want it.
She says it's spoiled!

618
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:59,360
I've been given the key.
I'll have it mended.

619
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:11,320
Please, Ada. Ada!

620
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:15,120
You'll regret it. It's your
piano, I want you to have it.

621
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:17,440
- She doesn't want it!
- Sit down!

622
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,320
- Throw it over!
- Stop!

623
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:26,040
All right, we'll throw it over.

624
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:41,480
