{3031}{3090}A fiddler on the roof.
{3092}{3153}Sounds crazy, no?
{3242}{3342}But here, in our little|village of Anatevka...
{3343}{3399}you might say...
{3400}{3477}every one of us|is a fiddler on the roof...
{3508}{3588}trying to scratch out...
{3590}{3641}a pleasant, simple tune...
{3670}{3730}without breaking his neck.
{3767}{3843}It isn't easy. You may ask...
{3845}{3895}why do we stay up there...
{3897}{3946}if it's so dangerous?
{3981}{4043}Well, we stay because...
{4045}{4123}Anatevka is our home.
{4170}{4246}And how do we keep our balance?
{4247}{4307}That I can tell you in one word:
{4332}{4367}Tradition!
{4439}{4488}Tradition
{5073}{5154}Because of our traditions...
{5155}{5252}we've kept our balance|for many, many years.
{5396}{5445}Here in Anatevka...
{5447}{5515}we have traditions|for everything:
{5541}{5601}how to sleep, how to eat...
{5658}{5704}how to work...
{5772}{5819}how to wear clothes.
{5878}{5986}For instance, we always|keep our heads covered...
{5988}{6089}and always wear|a little prayer shawl.
{6091}{6209}This shows|our constant devotion to God.
{6211}{6257}You may ask...
{6259}{6342}how did this tradition|get started?
{6344}{6391}I'll tell you.
{6422}{6457}I don't know.
{6459}{6510}But it's a tradition.
{6535}{6595}And because of our traditions...
{6623}{6722}every one of us knows who he is...
{6723}{6809}and what God expects him to do.
{6902}{6973}Who day and night|must scramble for a living
{6975}{7048}Feed a wife and children|Say his daily prayers
{7050}{7114}And who has a right|as master of the house
{7116}{7171}To have the final word at home
{7199}{7246}The papa
{7320}{7367}Tradition
{7575}{7646}Who must know the way|to make a proper home
{7647}{7721}A quiet home, a kosher home
{7723}{7792}Who must raise a family|and run the home
{7794}{7865}So Papa's free to read|the Holy Book
{7942}{7996}The mama
{8051}{8086}Tradition
{8351}{8428}At three I started Hebrew school
{8430}{8497}At ten I learned a trade
{8499}{8573}I hear they picked|a bride for me
{8575}{8645}I hope she's pretty
{8647}{8715}And who does Mama teach
{8717}{8787}To mend and tend and fix
{8789}{8871}Preparing her to marry
{8872}{8926}Whoever Papa picks
{8955}{9002}The daughters
{9059}{9094}Tradition
{9095}{9141}- The papa|- Mama
{9143}{9178}- Sons|- The daughters
{9210}{9244}Tradition
{9372}{9466}And in the circle|of our little village...
{9467}{9534}we've always had our special types.
{9535}{9562}For instance...
{9585}{9657}Yente the matchmaker...
{9659}{9718}Reb Nachum the beggar...
{9795}{9875}and most important of all...
{9876}{9919}our beloved rabbi.
{9921}{9982}Rabbi, may I ask a question?
{9984}{10019}Certainly.
{10020}{10102}Is there a proper blessing|for the czar?
{10103}{10188}A blessing for the czar?|Of course.
{10190}{10272}May God bless and keep the czar...
{10274}{10334}far away from us.
{11248}{11332}Then there are the others|in our village.
{11334}{11425}They make a much bigger circle.
{11511}{11557}We don't bother them...
{11559}{11642}and so far, they don't bother us.
{11711}{11765}And among ourselves...
{11767}{11842}we always get along perfectly well.
{11875}{11922}Of course, there was the time...
{11923}{11985}when he sold him a horse...
{11987}{12051}and told him it was six years old...
{12053}{12117}when it was really 12.
{12119}{12190}But now, it's all over...
{12192}{12295}and we all live|in simple peace and harmony.
{12390}{12442}- It was really 12 years old.|- It was six.
{12443}{12494}Tevye knows it was 12.
{12662}{12719}Twelve!
{12720}{12783}It was 12!
{12952}{13003}Tradition
{13395}{13462}Traditions, traditions.
{13464}{13519}Without our traditions...
{13521}{13628}our lives would be as shaky as...
{13654}{13744}as a fiddler on the roof.
{19108}{19195}Mama! Yente the matchmaker|is coming.
{19196}{19271}Maybe she's finally found a match|for you, Tzeitel.
{19272}{19329}From your mouth to God's ears.
{19331}{19407}Why does she come now?|It's almost Sabbath.
{19408}{19470}I want to talk to Yente alone.
{19472}{19528}But, Mama, the men she finds.
{19530}{19651}The last was so old,|and he was bald. He had no hair.
{19674}{19744}A girl without a dowry|can't be so particular.
{19745}{19795}You want hair, marry a monkey.
{19796}{19873}Even a poor girl has to look|at her husband sometime.
{19875}{19935}A husband's to get, not to look at.
{19937}{19984}I'm not yet 20...
{20026}{20084}Do you have to boast|about your age?
{20085}{20171}Do you want to tempt the evil eye?|Out, all of you.
{20173}{20251}There's work to be done|before the Sabbath. Hurry!
{20484}{20541}Golde, I have such news for you.
{20543}{20595}Not every day in the week news.
{20597}{20662}Once in a lifetime news.
{20664}{20774}Such diamonds, such jewels.
{20776}{20865}I'll find a husband|for every one of them...
{20867}{20939}but you shouldn't be|so picky, right?
{20941}{21003}Of course right,|because after all...
{21004}{21071}even the worst|husband, God forbid...
{21073}{21143}is better than no husband,|God forbid.
{21144}{21218}Who should know better than me?|Since my husband died...
{21220}{21336}I've been a poor widow,|all alone, no one to talk to.
{21337}{21398}All I do at night|is think of him.
{21400}{21486}Even that gives me no pleasure.
{21617}{21691}- Is Tzeitel in the house?|- Go in and find out.
{21693}{21740}Thank you, Bielke.
{21876}{21968}- He never raised his voice.|- Good afternoon.
{21970}{22002}Is Tzeitel here?
{22004}{22053}She's busy. Come back later.
{22055}{22132}- I'd like to tell her something.|- Later.
{22153}{22237}Later. Oh, all right.
{22239}{22322}What does that skinny tailor|want with Tzeitel?
{22324}{22398}They've been friends since they|were babies. They talk, they play.
{22400}{22461}Play? What do they play?
{22463}{22509}I don't know. They're children.
{22511}{22572}From such children|come other children.
{22574}{22625}Motel is nothing.
{22627}{22705}Yente, you said|you had news for me.
{22707}{22756}Children.
{22758}{22822}They are your blessing|in your old age.
{22824}{22931}But my Aaron, may he rest in peace,|couldn't give me children.
{22933}{23007}To tell the truth,|Golde, he hardly tried.
{23009}{23071}But what's the use complaining?
{23073}{23162}Other women enjoy complaining.|Not Yente.
{23164}{23249}Not every woman|in the world is a Yente.
{23251}{23327}Well, l...|I have to go home now...
{23328}{23390}to prepare my poor Sabbath meal.
{23392}{23443}So good-bye, Golde...
{23444}{23535}and it was a pleasure|talking our hearts out.
{23536}{23594}You said you had news.
{23596}{23651}Oi, I'm losing my head.
{23653}{23709}Someday it'll fall off altogether...
{23711}{23760}and a horse will kick it in the mud...
{23762}{23808}and good-bye, Yente.
{23810}{23872}Of course, the news.
{23897}{23966}It's about Lazar Wolf, the butcher.
{23968}{24014}A good, fine man...
{24016}{24082}and I don't have to say|he's well off, no?
{24084}{24176}Yes. But he's Ionely, the poor man.
{24178}{24243}He's been a widower all these years.
{24245}{24326}Of course you understand.|So, to make it short.
{24328}{24420}Out of the whole town,|he's cast his eye...
{24422}{24474}on Tzeitel.
{24476}{24565}- My Tzeitel?|- No, the czar's Tzeitel.
{24567}{24624}Of course your Tzeitel.
{24626}{24699}Such a match for my Tzeitel.
{24749}{24863}But Tevye wants a learned man.|He doesn't like Lazar.
{24865}{24919}Good, so Lazar won't marry him.
{24920}{24986}He wants the daughter, not the father.
{24988}{25047}Listen to me, Golde.
{25048}{25136}You send Tevye to him.|Don't tell him what it's about.
{25138}{25187}Let Lazar discuss it himself.
{25189}{25296}He'll win him over.|He's a good man and a wealthy man.
{25298}{25349}Let me know how it went.
{25351}{25423}You don't have to thank me...
{25424}{25518}because aside from my fee,|which Lazar will pay anyway...
{25520}{25566}it gives me satisfaction...
{25568}{25615}to make people happy.
{25617}{25695}True? Of course true.
{25697}{25788}So good-bye, Golde,|and you're welcome.
{25794}{25838}Good-bye, Yente.
{25884}{25965}Come, children, get changed|for the Sabbath. Hurry.
{25967}{26066}- Hurry with your work.|- I wonder if Yente found you a husband.
{26068}{26137}I'm not anxious for that.
{26139}{26207}- Unless it's Motel the tailor.|- I didn't ask you.
{26208}{26276}You're the oldest.|They have to make a match for you...
{26278}{26324}before making one for me.
{26326}{26360}Then after her, one for me.
{26361}{26417}- So if Yente...|- Yente!
{26446}{26501}Well, somebody has to|arrange the matches.
{26503}{26567}- She might bring someone wonderful.|- Someone interesting.
{26569}{26623}- Well-off.|- And important.
{26692}{26788}Matchmaker, matchmaker|Make me a match
{26790}{26856}Find me a find
{26858}{26900}Catch me a catch
{26926}{27037}Matchmaker, matchmaker|Look through your book
{27039}{27122}And make me a perfect match
{27191}{27290}Matchmaker, matchmaker|I'll bring the veil
{27292}{27345}You bring the groom
{27347}{27416}Slender and pale
{27417}{27495}Bring me a ring|for I'm longing to be
{27497}{27576}The envy of all I see
{27578}{27656}For Papa, make him a scholar
{27658}{27736}For Mama, make him rich as a king
{27738}{27811}For me, well, I wouldn't holler
{27812}{27919}If he were as handsome as anything
{27921}{27993}Matchmaker, matchmaker|Make me a match
{27995}{28074}Find me a find|Catch me a catch
{28076}{28142}Night after night|in the dark I'm alone
{28144}{28190}So find me a match
{28192}{28299}Of my own
{28343}{28403}Since when are you|interested in a match, Chava?
{28405}{28473}I thought you had|your eye on books.
{28475}{28534}You have your eye|on the rabbi's son.
{28536}{28630}Well, why not?|We only have one rabbi...
{28632}{28700}and he only has one son.
{28702}{28745}Why shouldn't I want the best?
{28747}{28806}Because you're from a poor family...
{28808}{28857}so whatever Yente brings, you'll take.
{28859}{28939}Right? Of course right.
{28956}{29029}Hodel, oh, Hodel|Have I made a match for you
{29031}{29101}He's handsome, he's young|All right, he's 62
{29103}{29195}But he's a nice man|A good catch, true, true
{29196}{29278}I promise you'll be happy|And even if you're not
{29280}{29328}There's more to life than that
{29330}{29379}Don't ask me what
{29446}{29523}Chava, I found him|Will you be a lucky bride
{29524}{29599}He's handsome, he's tall|That is, from side to side
{29601}{29657}But he's a nice man|A good catch
{29659}{29694}- Right|- Right
{29696}{29775}- You heard he has a temper|- He'll beat you every night
{29777}{29860}But only when he's sober|So you're all right
{29892}{29950}Did you think you'd get a prince
{29952}{30022}Well, I'll find the best I can
{30024}{30131}With no dowry, no money
{30133}{30199}No family background
{30200}{30295}Be glad you've got a man
{30443}{30515}Matchmaker, matchmaker|You know that I'm
{30516}{30559}Still very young
{30560}{30624}Please take your time
{30627}{30722}Up to this minute|I misunderstood
{30722}{30810}That I could get stuck for good
{30812}{30885}Dear Yente|See that he's gentle
{30887}{30963}Remember you were also a bride
{30965}{31061}It's not that I'm sentimental
{31063}{31162}It's just that I'm terrified
{31164}{31236}Matchmaker, matchmaker|Plan me no plans
{31238}{31319}I'm in no rush|Maybe I've learned
{31320}{31431}Playing with matches|a girl can get burned
{31432}{31487}So bring me no ring
{31488}{31562}Groom me no groom|Find me no find
{31564}{31612}Catch me no catch
{31614}{31735}Unless he's a matchless match
{32179}{32275}Dear God, was that necessary?
{32324}{32415}Did you have to make him lame|just before the Sabbath?
{32446}{32519}Ah, that wasn't nice.
{32520}{32559}It's enough you pick on me...
{32561}{32638}bless me with five daughters,|a life of poverty.
{32640}{32733}That's all right, but what|have you got against my horse?
{32770}{32846}Really, sometimes I think...
{32848}{32916}when things are too quiet|up there...
{32918}{32974}you say to yourself...
{32976}{33036}"Let's see.|What kind of mischief...
{33038}{33106}can I play on my friend Tevye?"
{33246}{33320}Aha! So you're finally here,|my breadwinner.
{33322}{33362}I'll talk to you later.
{33364}{33445}- So why are you late today?|- His foot went lame.
{33447}{33508}Hurry. The sun won't wait.
{33510}{33562}I have something|important to say.
{33564}{33651}- I still have deliveries.|- You'll be late for the Sabbath.
{33653}{33685}I won't be late.
{33687}{33722}You'll be late.
{33724}{33770}I won't be late.
{33816}{33885}If you ever stop talking,|I won't be late!
{33887}{33926}You can die from him.
{33928}{33980}As the Good Book says...
{33982}{34050}"Heal us, O Lord,|and we shall be healed."
{34089}{34161}In other words,|send us the cure.
{34163}{34221}We've got the sickness already.
{34458}{34525}Well, I'm not really complaining.
{34557}{34608}After all, with your help...
{34677}{34727}I'm starving to death.
{34764}{34813}Oh, dear Lord.
{34919}{35016}You made many, many poor people.
{35018}{35131}I realize, of course,|it's no shame to be poor...
{35132}{35185}but it's no great honor either.
{35328}{35407}So what would have been|so terrible...
{35408}{35507}if I had a small fortune?
{35626}{35675}If I were a rich man
{35798}{35883}All day long|I'd biddy biddy bum
{35885}{35971}If I were a wealthy man
{35973}{36020}I wouldn't have to work hard
{36144}{36232}If I were a biddy biddy rich
{36234}{36320}Idle deedle daidle daidle man
{36322}{36369}I'd build
{36371}{36428}A big, tall house
{36430}{36483}With rooms by the dozen
{36484}{36560}Right in the middle of the town
{36562}{36675}A fine tin roof|with real wooden floors below
{36711}{36818}There would be one long staircase|just going up
{36820}{36901}And one even longer coming down
{36903}{37018}And one more leading nowhere|Just for show
{37085}{37159}I'd fill my yard
{37161}{37222}With chicks and turkeys and geese
{37224}{37317}And ducks for the town|to see and hear
{37319}{37422}Squawking just as noisily as they can
{37459}{37505}And each loud
{37568}{37643}Will land like|a trumpet on the ear
{37645}{37689}As if to say
{37691}{37810}Here lives a wealthy man
{37948}{38008}If I were a rich man
{38122}{38210}All day long|I'd biddy biddy bum
{38212}{38275}If I were a wealthy man
{38276}{38350}I wouldn't have to work hard
{38467}{38557}If I were a biddy biddy rich
{38559}{38655}Idle deedle daidle daidle man
{38657}{38779}I'd see my wife, my Golde
{38780}{38831}Looking like a rich man's wife
{38832}{38903}With a proper double chin
{38904}{39002}Supervising meals|to her heart's delight
{39046}{39159}I'd see her putting on airs|and strutting like a peacock
{39161}{39240}Oh, what a happy mood she's in
{39242}{39348}Screaming at her servants|day and night
{39450}{39503}The most important men in town
{39504}{39571}Will come to fawn on me
{39587}{39673}They will ask me to advise them
{39675}{39767}Like Solomon the Wise
{39769}{39855}If you please, Reb Tevye
{39857}{39964}Pardon me, Reb Tevye
{39966}{40100}Posing problems that|would cross a rabbi's eyes
{40372}{40457}And it won't make|one bit of difference
{40459}{40545}If I answer right or wrong
{40547}{40660}When you're rich|they think you really know
{40717}{40797}If I were rich
{40799}{40873}I'd have the time that I lack
{40875}{40959}To sit in the synagogue and pray
{40961}{41074}And maybe have a seat|by the Eastern wall
{41105}{41189}And I'd discuss the holy books
{41191}{41301}With the learned men|seven hours every day
{41303}{41342}And that would be
{41344}{41453}The sweetest thing of all
{41599}{41650}If I were a rich man
{41770}{41857}All day long|I'd biddy biddy bum
{41859}{41918}If I were a wealthy man
{41920}{41995}I wouldn't have to work hard
{42112}{42188}Lord who made|the lion and the lamb
{42190}{42270}You decreed I should be what I am
{42272}{42393}Would it spoil|some vast eternal plan
{42435}{42474}If I were
{42476}{42577}A wealthy man
{43009}{43074}Where's your horse?
{43075}{43167}Well, he decided|to take the day off.
{43169}{43262}- Have a good Sabbath.|- Thank you, Your Honor.
{43311}{43379}- Tevye, you're late.|- Where's your horse?
{43381}{43466}- It's almost the Sabbath.|- You kept us all waiting.
{43468}{43505}What happened to your horse?
{43507}{43607}Look at this!|Look what it says in the paper!
{43609}{43674}- Look.|- What's the matter, Avram?
{43675}{43718}Sha! Quiet!
{43743}{43861}Stop braying like a pack of mules,|and let a man talk. Talk, Avram.
{43863}{43962}My paper came to the post office|today like it does every week.
{43963}{44027}Usually it comes Thursday,|but sometimes...
{44029}{44123}Avram, that's not talking.|That's babbling.
{44125}{44194}- Tell us the news.|- What does it say?
{44195}{44267}Quiet!|Talk, Avram.
{44269}{44330}Well, I was reading my paper.
{44332}{44418}It's nothing very important... a story|about the crops in the Ukraine...
{44419}{44454}and this and that.
{44455}{44502}Avram, talk.
{44559}{44630}And then, I saw this.
{44682}{44749}All right. We all see it.
{44796}{44852}What does it say?
{44926}{44995}"In a village called Rajanka...
{44997}{45043}all the Jews were evicted...
{45044}{45114}forced to leave their homes."
{45152}{45187}For what reason?
{45231}{45336}It doesn't say. Maybe the czar|wanted their land. Maybe a plague.
{45338}{45384}May the czar have|his own personal plague!
{45386}{45426}Amen!
{45427}{45515}Why don't you ever bring us|some good news?
{45517}{45597}It's not my fault.|I only read it.
{45599}{45653}"An edict from the authorities."
{45655}{45702}May the authorities|grow like onions...
{45703}{45751}with their heads in the ground.
{45789}{45841}What good will your cursing do?
{45877}{45995}You stand around, curse and chatter,|and you don't do anything.
{45996}{46060}You'll all chatter your way|into the grave.
{46062}{46155}Excuse me.|You're not from this village.
{46179}{46210}Where are you from?
{46212}{46250}Kiev.
{46252}{46293}I studied at the university.
{46295}{46358}The university.
{46360}{46422}Tell me, is that a place|where you learned...
{46423}{46473}how not to respect your elders?
{46475}{46556}That's where I learned|there is more to life than talk.
{46558}{46655}- You need to know the outside world.|- Careful, my paper.
{46657}{46722}Why should I break my head|about the outside world?
{46724}{46778}Let the outside world|break its own head.
{46780}{46827}Well put!
{46843}{46925}He's right.|As the Good Book says...
{46927}{47028}"If you spit in the air,|it lands in your face."
{47030}{47076}Nonsense.
{47078}{47147}You can't close your eyes|to what's happening in the world.
{47197}{47226}He's right.
{47227}{47281}He's right, and he's right?
{47283}{47338}They can't both be right.
{47366}{47412}You know, you are also right.
{47414}{47486}He's too young|to wipe his own nose.
{47488}{47555}Good Sabbath, Tevye.|The university!
{47607}{47661}- Here. Good Sabbath.|- Good Sabbath, Tevye.
{47745}{47840}Oh, yes. I'm sorry.|I apologize. Here.
{47889}{47940}Tevye, the rabbi's order.
{47942}{47976}Of course.
{47999}{48054}So you are from Kiev, Reb...
{48055}{48091}Perchik.
{48117}{48183}So you are a newcomer here, huh?
{48211}{48261}As Abraham said...
{48263}{48358}"I'm a stranger|in a strange land."
{48360}{48407}Moses said that.
{48408}{48443}Forgive me.
{48445}{48556}As King David said, "I'm slow of speech|and slow of tongue."
{48558}{48604}That was also Moses.
{48659}{48729}For a man with a slow tongue|he talked a lot.
{48800}{48850}Here, Reb Perchik.
{48852}{48906}Have a piece.
{48908}{48974}I have no money,|and I'm not a beggar.
{48976}{49067}Take it. It's a blessing|for me to give.
{49118}{49174}Very well. For your sake.
{49175}{49245}Thank you.
{49247}{49318}You know, it's no crime|to be poor.
{49320}{49379}In this world,|the rich are the criminals.
{49380}{49461}- Someday their wealth will be ours.|- That would be nice.
{49463}{49544}If they would agree, I would agree.
{49546}{49615}Who will make this miracle|come to pass?
{49617}{49672}People. Ordinary people.
{49674}{49742}- Like you?|- Like me.
{49743}{49847}Until your golden day comes,|Reb Perchik, how will you live?
{49849}{49934}By giving lessons to children.|Do you have any children?
{49935}{49982}I have five daughters.
{50004}{50048}Five!
{50050}{50092}Daughters!
{50094}{50167}Girls should learn too.|Girls are people.
{50169}{50206}- A radical!|- Go away.
{50207}{50313}I'd be willing to teach them,|open their minds to great thoughts.
{50315}{50374}I'd like them|to know the Good Book.
{50376}{50451}The Bible has many lessons|for our times.
{50453}{50511}Perchik...
{50512}{50579}I'm a very poor man...
{50581}{50667}but food for lessons, huh?
{50669}{50733}Good. Stay with us for the Sabbath.
{50735}{50791}Of course, we don't|eat like kings...
{50793}{50832}but we don't starve either.
{50834}{50919}As the Good Book says,|when a poor man eats a chicken...
{50921}{50973}one of them is sick.
{50975}{51016}Where does the Book say that?
{51018}{51106}All right. It doesn't|exactly say that...
{51108}{51186}but someplace it has something|about a chicken.
{51187}{51242}Good Sabbath.
{51244}{51333}- Did Yente find somebody?|- I don't know.
{51335}{51389}- Good Sabbath, children.|- Good Sabbath, Papa.
{51391}{51453}Children, this is Perchik.
{51455}{51505}Perchik, this is|my eldest daughter.
{51507}{51558}Good Sabbath. You have|a pleasant daughter.
{51560}{51638}I have five pleasant daughters.
{51639}{51726}This is mine, and this is mine...
{51728}{51785}and this is mine...
{51787}{51886}and this is mine,|and this is mine, and...
{51919}{52001}Well, this is not mine.|This is Motel Kamzoil.
{52003}{52092}So, you did us a favor|and came home.
{52143}{52190}Well, this is also mine.
{52227}{52302}This is Perchik from Kiev.
{52304}{52380}He'll be staying the Sabbath|with us. He is a teacher!
{52382}{52482}- Would you like to take lessons?|- I'm a good teacher.
{52483}{52596}I heard that the rabbi who must praise|himself has a congregation of one.
{52642}{52699}Your daughter has a quick|and witty tongue.
{52700}{52797}The wit she gets from me.|As the Good Book says...
{52799}{52848}The Good Book can wait.|Wash.
{52850}{52896}The tongue she gets|from her mother.
{52898}{52962}Motel, you're also eating with us?
{52963}{53036}Of course. Another blessing.
{53038}{53122}Tzeitel, get the small table.|Chava, the two chairs from outside.
{53124}{53180}Children, finish dressing.|You can wash at the well.
{53182}{53284}Hurry. Hodel, help them.|It's almost the Sabbath. Hurry!
{53386}{53436}Tevye, I have something|to say to you.
{53438}{53503}Why should today be different?
{53504}{53560}I have something to tell you!
{53561}{53608}Tzeitel, I have|something to tell you.
{53609}{53668}- Yente was here.|- I saw her.
{53670}{53754}If there's a match,|it will be too late for us.
{53756}{53866}But I've found someone who will|sell me his sewing machine.
{53868}{53943}So maybe in a few weeks|I can buy it, and then your father...
{53944}{53989}That might be too late.
{53991}{54037}Lazar Wolf wants to see you.
{54039}{54080}The butcher?|What is it about?
{54082}{54140}I don't know, only|he says it's important.
{54142}{54220}I have nothing|for him to slaughter.
{54222}{54283}After the Sabbath,|talk with him.
{54284}{54405}About what? If he's thinking|about buying my new milk cow...
{54407}{54453}he can forget it.
{54455}{54495}I want you to talk...
{54653}{54700}I want you to talk to...
{54808}{54855}What else can I do?
{54902}{54951}You could ask my father|for my hand tonight.
{54953}{55000}Now.
{55002}{55060}Why should he consider me?|I'm a poor tailor.
{55062}{55154}I'm only a poor milkman's daughter.|Just talk to him.
{55156}{55250}Tzeitel, if your father|says no, that's it. It's final.
{55276}{55332}He'll yell at me.
{55333}{55402}I'm just a poor tailor.
{55404}{55485}Even a poor tailor|is entitled to some happiness.
{55555}{55589}That's true.
{55669}{55741}Amen. A man sends you an important|message, you can talk to him.
{55743}{55780}- I don't want to...|- Talk to him!
{55782}{55864}All right!|After the Sabbath I'll talk to him!
{55865}{55924}All right. I'll talk to him.
{56147}{56192}Well, it's getting late.
{56220}{56293}- Where is everybody?|- I don't know, Papa.
{56295}{56395}Children! Come down, children!|We are lighting the candles.
{56396}{56491}Not now, Motel. Hurry up, children!
{56492}{56535}Not now, Motel.
{56561}{56617}The sun is almost down.
{56619}{56649}What is it?
{56704}{56750}Yes?
{56796}{56844}Well, Motel, what is it?
{56916}{56974}Good Sabbath, Reb Tevye.
{57076}{57111}Hurry up.
{57113}{57189}Hurry, children.|It's getting late.
{58112}{58238}May the Lord|protect and defend you
{58264}{58392}May he always|shield you from shame
{58417}{58488}May you come to be
{58489}{58629}In Israel a shining name
{58731}{58851}May you be like Ruth|and like Esther
{58877}{59010}May you be deserving of praise
{59028}{59094}Strengthen them, O Lord
{59096}{59224}And keep them|from the stranger's ways
{59339}{59438}May God bless you
{59440}{59506}And grant you long lives
{59508}{59648}May the Lord fulfill|our Sabbath prayer for you
{59649}{59745}May God make you
{59747}{59809}Good mothers and wives
{59811}{59863}May he send you husbands
{59865}{59977}Who will care for you
{59979}{60105}May the Lord protect and defend you
{60131}{60248}May the Lord preserve you from pain
{60280}{60359}Favor them, O Lord
{60361}{60421}With happiness and peace
{60423}{60516}Oh, hear our Sabbath prayer
{60547}{60677}Amen
{61179}{61226}Is Reb...
{61276}{61331}Is Reb Lazar Wolf at home?
{61446}{61507}Is Reb Lazar Wolf at home?
{61508}{61559}He's in the back.
{61561}{61612}Oh. May l...
{61679}{61750}- Come in.|- Oh, thank you.
{62068}{62143}And all this from|killing innocent animals?
{62145}{62219}- Don't touch anything.|- All right.
{62958}{63061}Well, Tevye.|You're here.
{63063}{63149}- Well, sit down.|- Thank you.
{63151}{63247}- Have a drink.|- I won't insult you by saying no.
{63308}{63403}Well. How goes it with you,|Reb Tevye?
{63405}{63474}- How should it go?|- You're right.
{63476}{63536}- And you?|- The same.
{63538}{63584}I'm sorry to hear that.
{63908}{64014}How is your brother-in-law|in America?
{64016}{64077}- He's doing very well.|- Oh, he wrote you?
{64079}{64140}- No, not lately.|- Then how do you know?
{64142}{64197}If he was doing badly,|he would write.
{64579}{64626}Yes?
{64664}{64771}I suppose you know|why I wanted to see you.
{64773}{64850}Oh, yes, I do, but...
{64852}{64917}there is no use talking about it.
{65006}{65080}I understand how you feel...
{65082}{65136}but...
{65138}{65215}After all, you have|a few more without her.
{65217}{65267}Ah, I see.
{65269}{65351}Today you want one.|Tomorrow you may want two.
{65353}{65446}Two? What would I do with two?
{65448}{65502}The same as you do with one.
{65833}{65903}This is very important to me.
{65905}{65979}Why is it so important to you?
{66014}{66061}Frankly...
{66062}{66109}because...
{66146}{66193}I'm Ionely.
{66255}{66313}Lonely?
{66315}{66408}Reb Lazar, what are|you talking about?
{66409}{66460}How can a little cow|keep you company?
{66461}{66538}Little cow?|Is that what you call her?
{66540}{66619}What else should I call her? That's|what she is. What are you talking about?
{66621}{66709}- Don't you know?|- We're talking about my milk cow...
{66711}{66761}you want to buy from me.
{66763}{66809}A milk cow?
{66906}{66956}A milk cow so I won't be Ionely?
{67104}{67168}I'm talking about...
{67169}{67254}your daughter Tzeitel.
{67256}{67319}My daughter Tzeitel?
{67321}{67379}Of course.|Your daughter Tzeitel.
{67381}{67491}I see her every Thursday|in my butcher shop...
{67493}{67568}and she's made|a very good impression on me.
{67570}{67617}A very good impression.
{67680}{67724}I like her.
{67785}{67843}Why don't we just shake hands...
{67845}{67891}and call it a match?
{67981}{68032}And...
{68034}{68086}I'll be good to her.
{68245}{68292}l...
{68309}{68355}I like her.
{68429}{68476}Well?
{68516}{68595}- What do you think?|- What do I think?
{68789}{68835}I never really liked him.
{68881}{68983}Why should I? You can have a fine|conversation with him...
{68985}{69061}if you talk|about kidneys and livers.
{69063}{69101}On the other hand...
{69135}{69207}not everyone has to be a scholar.
{69241}{69300}And with a butcher...
{69301}{69372}my daughter will|surely never know hunger.
{69409}{69455}Maybe I misjudged him.
{69505}{69552}He's a good man.
{69604}{69650}He likes her.
{69713}{69783}And he'll try|to make her happy.
{69886}{69928}What do I think?
{69961}{69997}It's a match.
{70024}{70076}- You agree?|- I agree.
{70141}{70201}- You've made me a happy man.|- Good.
{70202}{70256}- Let's drink on it.|- Why not?
{70309}{70368}- To you.|- No, my friend. To you.
{70370}{70468}- To both of us.|- To our agreement!
{70473}{70516}To our prosperity.
{70574}{70642}To our good health|and happiness.
{70687}{70738}And most important of all...
{70840}{70902}To life, to life|Le'chayim
{70928}{71003}Le'chayim, le'chayim|To life
{71005}{71064}Here's to the father|I've tried to be
{71065}{71114}Here's to my bride-to-be
{71116}{71187}Drink le'chayim to life
{71314}{71376}Life has a way|of confusing us
{71378}{71428}Blessing and bruising us
{71513}{71574}God would like us to be joyful
{71576}{71685}Even when our hearts|lie panting on the floor
{71687}{71752}How much more can we be joyful
{71753}{71795}When there's really something
{71797}{71867}To be joyful for
{71958}{72034}- To Tzeitel, my daughter|- My wife
{72036}{72095}It gives you|something to think about
{72097}{72147}Something to drink about
{72277}{72344}- Mordcha!|- Yes. What is it?
{72345}{72405}- Drinks for everyone!|- What's the big occasion?
{72406}{72460}I'm taking myself a bride!
{72461}{72551}- Who's the lucky one?|- Tevye's eldest, Tzeitel!
{72669}{72707}To Lazar Wolf
{72709}{72750}To Tevye
{72752}{72819}- To Tzeitel, your daughter|- My wife
{72821}{72872}May all your futures|be pleasant ones
{72873}{72911}Not like our present ones
{73098}{73149}It takes a wedding|to make us say
{73151}{73196}Let's live another day
{73253}{73318}We'll raise a glass|and sip a drop of schnapps
{73320}{73399}In honor of the great good luck|that favored you
{73420}{73493}We know that when good fortune|favors two such men
{73495}{73557}It stands to reason|we deserve it too
{73586}{73666}To us and our good fortune
{73668}{73736}Be happy, be healthy, long life
{73737}{73790}And if our good fortune|never comes
{73792}{73836}Here's to whatever comes
{74912}{75007}Heaven bless you both
{75057}{75136}To your health
{75138}{75248}And may we live|together in peace
{75250}{75304}Thank you.
{75583}{75659}May you both be favored|with the future of your choice
{75661}{75738}May you live to see|a thousand reasons to rejoice
{78224}{78302}Hey! I like it!
{80013}{80061}Drinks for everybody!
{80188}{80234}To life!
{80793}{80835}After...
{80837}{80883}the marriage...
{80885}{80946}we will be related.
{80970}{81039}You will be my...
{81041}{81104}papa.
{81105}{81152}Your papa?
{81265}{81315}Lazar Wolf...
{81317}{81390}I always wanted a son.
{81437}{81537}But I wanted one|a little younger than myself.
{81817}{81863}Good night.
{82116}{82195}I hear that congratulations|are in order, Tevye.
{82197}{82254}Oh, thank you, Your Honor.
{82533}{82576}Yes, Your Honor?
{82609}{82696}I have news I think|I should tell you as a friend.
{82725}{82821}I'm giving you this news|because I like you.
{82823}{82905}You're an honest, decent person,|even though you are a Jew.
{82907}{83016}Oh, thank you, Your Honor.
{83017}{83140}How often does a man get|a compliment like that?
{83156}{83218}And the news?
{83220}{83275}We have received orders|that sometime soon...
{83277}{83388}this district is to have|a little unofficial demonstration.
{83425}{83472}What?
{83537}{83608}A pogrom? Here?
{83609}{83692}No. Just a little|unofficial demonstration.
{83693}{83728}Little?
{83754}{83814}- How little?|- Not too serious.
{83816}{83885}Just mischief so that if|an inspector comes...
{83887}{83933}he can see that we did our duty.
{83969}{84060}Personally, I don't know why there has|to be trouble between people.
{84061}{84115}But I thought I should tell you.
{84155}{84201}Thank you, Your Honor.
{84246}{84293}You're a good man.
{84333}{84394}If I may say so...
{84396}{84452}it's too bad|you're not a Jew.
{84492}{84538}That's what I like about you.
{84540}{84586}You're always joking.
{84718}{84781}Congratulations again|for your daughter.
{84783}{84852}Thank you, Your Honor.
{84853}{84917}Oh, about the other matter,|it won't be too bad.
{84919}{84997}- I wouldn't worry.|- Of course not.
{85429}{85496}Dear God...
{85497}{85588}did you have to send me|news like that...
{85589}{85636}today of all days?
{85689}{85784}I know, we are the chosen people...
{85825}{85934}but once in a while,|can't you choose someone else?
{86095}{86147}Anyway...
{86149}{86231}thank you for sending a husband...
{86233}{86279}for my Tzeitel.
{87890}{88006}Now, after Jacob had worked|for Laban for seven years...
{88008}{88055}do you know what happened?
{88057}{88164}Laban fooled him and gave him|his ugly daughter Leah.
{88166}{88276}So to marry Rachel, Jacob was forced|to work another seven years.
{88277}{88312}So you see, children...
{88313}{88373}the Bible clearly teaches us...
{88374}{88428}you can never trust an employer.
{88449}{88499}And that is what|the Bible teaches us?
{88501}{88556}That is the lesson of Jacob...
{88557}{88617}if you interpret it correctly.
{88619}{88691}- Is your papa up yet?|- No, Mama.
{88719}{88803}Enough lessons. Back to the house.|There's work to be done.
{88805}{88877}Go on, children.|Another story tomorrow.
{89017}{89080}That was a very interesting|lesson, Perchik.
{89125}{89169}Do you think so?
{89195}{89280}Although I don't know if the rabbi|would agree with your interpretation.
{89322}{89412}Neither, I suppose,|would the rabbi's son.
{89413}{89485}My little sisters|talk too much.
{89487}{89567}What do you know about him,|except that he is a rabbi's son?
{89569}{89652}At least I know|he doesn't have strange ideas...
{89653}{89703}about turning|the world upside-down.
{89705}{89749}Good day, Perchik.
{89751}{89821}- You have wit, even intelligence.|- Thank you.
{89822}{89883}Perhaps. But what good|is your brain?
{89885}{89961}Without curiosity,|it is a rusty tool.
{89963}{90045}- Good day, Hodel.|- We have an old custom here!
{90046}{90116}A boy talks|respectfully to a girl.
{90117}{90212}But that is too traditional|for an advanced thinker like you.
{90214}{90310}Nothing must change. Everything|is perfect exactly as it is!
{90312}{90405}- We like our ways.|- Our ways are changing all over.
{90406}{90487}In the city, boys and girls|can be affectionate...
{90489}{90535}without the permission|of a matchmaker.
{90561}{90641}They hold hands together.|They even dance together!
{90642}{90695}New dances, like this.
{90848}{90894}I learned it in Kiev.
{90980}{91061}- Do you like it?|- It's very nice.
{91485}{91512}There.
{91545}{91623}We've just changed|an old custom.
{91625}{91661}Yes.
{91709}{91770}I mean... thank you.
{91861}{91909}I mean...
{91911}{91957}good day!
{92743}{92813}So, my prince is finally|out of bed.
{92814}{92864}- Not now.|- Open your eyes.
{92866}{92926}- Go away.|- The day's half gone.
{92928}{92972}Well?
{92973}{93070}Well, what happened last night|besides your drinking like a peasant?
{93072}{93118}Did you see Lazar Wolf?
{93217}{93307}Well, what did he say?|What did you say?
{93309}{93355}Where...
{93357}{93403}Where's Tzeitel?
{93405}{93478}She's in the barn.|Do you have news for me?
{93480}{93548}Did you talk with Lazar Wolf?|Well, what happened?
{93549}{93612}Woman, patience.
{93654}{93741}As the Good Book says,|good news will stay...
{93743}{93811}and bad news|will refuse to leave.
{93813}{93899}- And there's another saying...|- You can die from such a man!
{93962}{94017}Did you see Lazar?|Was it friendly?
{94019}{94102}- Sha, woman!|- Are you still drunk, or what?
{94104}{94154}Here she is.
{94156}{94228}Tzeitel, my lamb, come here.
{94230}{94319}You are to be congratulated.
{94321}{94371}You are going to be married.
{94373}{94405}Married?
{94407}{94462}What do you mean, Papa?
{94491}{94554}Lazar Wolf has asked|for your hand.
{94556}{94593}I knew it!
{94595}{94667}- The butcher?|- Dear God, I thank thee.
{94669}{94740}- I thank thee!|- Why do you have to...
{94742}{94785}What do you say, Tzeitel?
{94787}{94855}- What can she say?|- Let her say one word.
{94857}{94927}My firstborn, a bride.
{95006}{95109}May you grow old with him|in fortune and honor.
{95111}{95171}Not like Fruma Sarah,|Lazar's first wife.
{95173}{95242}She was a bitter woman.|May she rest in peace.
{95243}{95305}Not like my Tzeitel.
{95339}{95396}And now I must thank Yente.
{95398}{95457}My Tzeitel, a bride.
{95459}{95522}A bride! I thank thee!
{95581}{95604}Well, Chaveleh?
{95670}{95713}Mazel tov, Tzeitel.
{95742}{95791}"Mazel tov, Tzeitel."
{95793}{95851}What kind of|a mazel tov is that?
{95853}{95962}You, Reb Perchik, aren't you going|to congratulate her?
{95990}{96025}Congratulations, Tzeitel...
{96027}{96087}for getting a rich man.
{96118}{96208}Again with the rich.|What's wrong with being rich?
{96210}{96297}It's no reason to marry.|Money's the world's curse.
{96331}{96388}May the Lord|smite me with it...
{96426}{96474}and may I never recover!
{96515}{96549}"The world's curse."
{96603}{96682}My Tzeitel knows|I mean only her welfare.
{96683}{96736}Am I right, Tzeitel?
{96738}{96799}- Yes, Papa.|- There, you see?
{96801}{96871}I see. I see very well.
{97125}{97177}Well, my child...
{97179}{97250}why are you so silent?
{97252}{97328}Aren't you happy|with this blessing?
{97389}{97427}Papa...
{97463}{97509}What is it? Tell me.
{97538}{97595}Papa, I don't want|to marry him.
{97597}{97670}I can't marry him.
{97672}{97726}What do you mean you can't?
{97727}{97837}If I say you will, you will.
{97839}{97929}Papa, if it's a matter of money,|I'll do anything.
{97931}{97985}I'll work as a servant.
{97987}{98067}- Just don't...|- But we made an agreement!
{98069}{98130}And with us, an agreement|is an agreement.
{98180}{98226}Is that...
{98251}{98332}more important than I am, Papa?
{98447}{98510}Papa, don't force me, please!
{98511}{98580}I'll be unhappy all my days!
{98694}{98779}- I don't want to marry him.|- All right.
{98827}{98878}I won't force you.
{98879}{98971}Oh, thank you, Papa.
{98973}{99019}"Thank you, Papa."
{99109}{99202}It seems it was not ordained...
{99203}{99282}that you should have|all the comforts of life.
{99499}{99582}- Reb Tevye, may I speak to you?|- Later.
{99584}{99668}- But I would like to speak to you.|- Not now.
{99670}{99716}I have problems.
{99743}{99851}That's why I want to speak to you.|I think I can help.
{99853}{99946}Like a bandage can help a corpse.|Good-bye, Motel.
{99947}{100031}At least listen to him, Papa.
{100033}{100122}All right.|You have a tongue. Talk.
{100123}{100200}I hear you are arranging|a match for Tzeitel.
{100202}{100236}He also has ears.
{100238}{100276}Well...
{100303}{100388}- I have a match for Tzeitel.|- What kind of a match?
{100390}{100449}A perfect fit.
{100451}{100502}Like a glove.
{100504}{100561}This match was made|exactly to measure.
{100563}{100693}"Made to measure." Stop talking|like a tailor and tell me who is it?
{100695}{100754}Please don't shout|at me, Reb Tevye.
{100756}{100800}I won't shout.
{100855}{100889}Who is it?
{101143}{101190}It's me.
{101225}{101266}Myself.
{101332}{101430}It's him. Himself.
{101432}{101506}Either you're out of your mind|or you're crazy!
{101508}{101599}He must be crazy!|Arranging a match for yourself?
{101601}{101703}Are you everything? The bridegroom,|the matchmaker, the guests?
{101705}{101777}I suppose you'll|perform the ceremony yourself!
{101779}{101838}Please don't shout at me.
{101839}{101909}Being my own matchmaker...|I know it's a little unusual.
{101911}{101959}Unusual? It's crazy!
{101962}{102012}Times are changing, Reb Tevye.
{102014}{102111}Over a year ago, your daughter and I|gave each other our pledge...
{102113}{102159}that we would marry.
{102283}{102338}You gave each other a pledge?
{102530}{102568}Yes, Papa.
{102603}{102673}We gave each other our pledge.
{102720}{102783}They gave each other a pledge.
{102785}{102846}Unheard of, absurd.
{102847}{102931}You gave each other a pledge|Unthinkable
{102966}{103057}Where do you think you are|In Moscow, in Paris
{103059}{103103}Where do they think they are
{103105}{103157}America
{103159}{103244}And what do you think you're doing|You stitcher, you nothing
{103246}{103332}Who do you think you are|King Solomon
{103334}{103426}This isn't the way it's done|Not here, not now
{103428}{103486}Some things I will not
{103487}{103570}I cannot allow
{103625}{103672}Tradition
{103674}{103728}Marriages must be arranged
{103730}{103782}By the papa
{103783}{103830}This should never be changed
{103831}{103878}One little time|you pull out the prop
{103879}{103934}And where does it stop
{103995}{104077}Do I still have something to say|about my daughter?
{104079}{104149}Doesn't anyone have to ask|a father anymore?
{104151}{104210}I've wanted to ask you for some time.
{104212}{104284}First I wanted to save enough|for a sewing machine.
{104286}{104348}You stop talking nonsense.
{104350}{104398}You are just a poor tailor!
{104399}{104494}But even a poor tailor|is entitled to some happiness!
{104784}{104858}I promise you, your daughter|will not starve.
{105009}{105086}He's beginning|to talk like a man.
{105131}{105181}On the other hand...
{105183}{105238}what kind of a match would that be...
{105239}{105302}with a poor tailor?
{105358}{105463}On the other hand, he is an honest,|hard worker.
{105509}{105560}But on the other hand...
{105562}{105622}he has absolutely nothing.
{105659}{105740}On the other hand,|things could never get worse for him.
{105742}{105788}They could only get better.
{105908}{105967}They gave each other a pledge
{105968}{106034}Unheard of, absurd
{106035}{106090}They gave each other|a pledge
{106091}{106127}Unthinkable
{106159}{106226}But look at my daughter's face
{106227}{106302}She loves him|She wants him
{106304}{106376}And look at my daughter's eyes
{106378}{106424}So hopeful
{106530}{106576}Tradition!
{106817}{106863}Well, children...
{106894}{106940}when shall we make the wedding?
{107023}{107069}Thank you, Papa!
{107131}{107177}You won't be sorry.
{107200}{107250}- I won't be sorry?|- No.
{107252}{107299}I'm sorry already!
{107301}{107347}Thank you, Papa.
{107384}{107422}All right.
{107696}{107752}They gave each other a pledge.
{108079}{108123}What shall I tell Golde?
{108282}{108332}You were wonderful!
{108334}{108380}It was a miracle!
{108406}{108473}Wonder of wonders|Miracle of miracles
{108474}{108549}God took a Daniel once again
{108550}{108623}Stood by his side|and miracle of miracles
{108625}{108694}Walked him through|the lion's den
{108695}{108773}Wonder of wonders|Miracle of miracles
{108775}{108849}I was afraid|that God would frown
{108851}{108922}But like he did|so long ago in Jericho
{108924}{108994}God just made|a wall fall down
{109075}{109148}When Moses softened|Pharaoh's heart
{109150}{109196}That was a miracle
{109226}{109305}When God made the waters|of the Red Sea part
{109307}{109374}That was a miracle too
{109376}{109453}But of all God's miracles|large and small
{109455}{109529}The most miraculous|one of all
{109530}{109637}Is that out of|a worthless lump of clay
{109639}{109769}God has made a man today
{109805}{109878}Wonder of wonders|Miracle of miracles
{109880}{109953}God took a tailor|by the hand
{109955}{110030}Turned him around|and miracle of miracles
{110032}{110098}Led him to the Promised Land
{110100}{110181}When David slew Goliath, yes
{110182}{110229}That was a miracle
{110257}{110344}When God gave us manna|in the wilderness
{110346}{110457}That was a miracle too
{110458}{110553}But of all God's miracles|large and small
{110555}{110653}The most miraculous|one of all
{110682}{110798}Is the one I thought|could never be
{110842}{110958}God has given you
{110959}{111044}To me
{111754}{111786}Good day.
{111788}{111829}Hello, Sarah.
{111830}{111888}- Mazel tov, Chava.|- Thank you.
{111890}{111935}- Soon it will be you.|- I hope so.
{111937}{111997}- Give my best wishes to Tzeitel.|- I will.
{112410}{112478}No, don't... Please.|I just want to pass.
{112544}{112596}All right, stop it.
{112598}{112641}What's wrong with you, Fyedka?
{112643}{112726}- Just stop it.|- We're just having a little fun.
{112727}{112783}Good-bye, Sasha.
{112785}{112837}I said good-bye.
{113270}{113332}I'm sorry about that.|They mean no harm.
{113334}{113372}Don't they?
{113703}{113750}Is there something you want?
{113751}{113826}Yes. I'd like|to talk to you.
{113828}{113874}I'd rather not.
{113924}{113985}I've often noticed you|at the bookseller's.
{113986}{114079}Not many girls in this village|like to read.
{114081}{114173}Would you like to|borrow this book?
{114174}{114221}It's very good.
{114378}{114405}Thank you.
{114407}{114461}Why?
{114463}{114510}Because I'm not Jewish?
{114556}{114598}Do you feel about me...
{114600}{114669}the way they feel about you?
{114670}{114717}I didn't think you would.
{114762}{114847}And what do you|know about me, eh?
{114849}{114920}Let me tell you about myself.
{114922}{115002}I'm a pleasant fellow.|Charming...
{115003}{115113}honest, ambitious, quite bright...
{115133}{115179}and very modest.
{115390}{115473}Go ahead.|Take the book...
{115474}{115534}and after you return it...
{115535}{115574}I'll ask you how you like it...
{115576}{115646}and we can talk|about it for a while.
{115647}{115685}Then we can talk about life...
{115687}{115761}how we feel about things.
{115788}{115822}Here.
{116076}{116114}Thank you.
{116198}{116236}Good day, Chava.
{116238}{116268}Good day.
{117514}{117555}- Help!|- Tevye, what's the matter?
{117557}{117646}- Motel, Tzeitel, help!|- Wake up! What is the matter?
{117648}{117690}Wake up!
{117692}{117739}- Where is she?|- Where? Who?
{117741}{117799}- Where is she?|- What are you talking about?
{117801}{117874}Fruma Sarah,|Lazar Wolf's first wife.
{117876}{117921}She was standing here a minute ago.
{117922}{117981}What are you talking about?
{117982}{118069}Fruma Sarah's been dead for years.|Sha!
{118071}{118125}- You must have been dreaming.|- Yes.
{118206}{118250}Now...
{118252}{118298}tell me what you dreamt...
{118300}{118375}and I'll tell you what it meant.
{118377}{118438}- It was terrible.|- Tell me.
{118440}{118473}All right...
{118474}{118536}only don't be frightened!
{118612}{118670}In the beginning...
{118672}{118718}I dreamt that...
{118766}{118812}we were having...
{118838}{118893}a celebration of some kind.
{118969}{119033}Everybody we knew...
{119034}{119108}all of our beloved departed...
{119110}{119148}were there.
{119202}{119265}All of them...
{119266}{119341}even your|Great Uncle Mordechai...
{119342}{119390}was there...
{119415}{119500}and your cousin Rachel|was there.
{119502}{119545}And in the middle of the dream...
{119547}{119649}in walks your grandmother Tzeitel,|may she rest in peace.
{119650}{119720}Grandmother Tzeitel!|How did she look?
{119722}{119773}Well, for a woman|who's dead 30 years...
{119774}{119840}she looked very good.
{119842}{119918}Naturally, I went up|to greet her.
{119920}{119959}A blessing on your head
{119961}{120010}Mazel tov, mazel tov
{120012}{120047}To see a daughter wed
{120094}{120180}And such a son-in-law|Like no one ever saw

{120650}{120698}- She meant the butcher.|- I'll tell her.
{120700}{120786}You must have heard wrong, Grandma

{121000}{121107}No, no, no|I mean the tailor, Tevye
{121108}{121178}My great-grandchild
{121180}{121265}My little Tzeitel|who you named for me
{121267}{121358}Motel's bride was meant to be
{121360}{121398}For such a match I prayed
{121442}{121480}In heaven it was made
{121529}{121572}A fine upstanding boy
{121574}{121613}A comfort and a joy
{121615}{121672}The tailor Motel Kamzoil
{121722}{121798}- Stop it!|- We made a bargain with the butcher.

{122587}{122624}- Yes, it could|- Why not
{122626}{122680}Who could be mistaken
{122731}{122797}It's the butcher's wife|come from beyond the grave
{122799}{122834}Oh, here she comes.
{122836}{122909}It's the butcher's dear|darling, departed wife

{123273}{123364}Would you do this to your friend|and neighbor, Fruma Sarah
{123366}{123463}Have you no consideration|for a woman's feelings
{123465}{123559}Handing over my belongings|to a total stranger
{123561}{123646}How can you allow it, How can you|let your daughter take my place
{123648}{123695}Live in my house, carry my keys
{123696}{123758}And wear my clothes, pearls
{123759}{123815}How can you allow your daughter|to take her place
{123817}{123839}- Pearls|- House
{123841}{123862}- Pearls|- Keys
{123864}{123907}- Pearls|- Clothes
{124103}{124199}Such a learned man as Tevye|wouldn't let it happen
{124201}{124299}Tell me that it isn't true|and then I wouldn't worry
{124301}{124399}Say you didn't give your blessing|to your daughter's marriage
{124401}{124498}Let me tell you what would follow|such a fatal wedding
{124725}{124829}If Tzeitel marries Lazar Wolf
{124863}{124910}I pity them both
{124950}{125074}She'll live with him three weeks
{125075}{125138}And when three weeks are up
{125159}{125227}I'll come to her by night
{125264}{125362}I'll take her by the throat
{125364}{125408}This I'll give your Tzeitel
{125410}{125456}This I'll give your Tzeitel
{125769}{125807}Jump!
{125863}{125923}Here's my wedding present
{125925}{126018}If she marries Lazar Wolf
{126083}{126138}Oh, spirit, away!
{126140}{126194}Such an evil spirit.
{126196}{126283}May it sink back into the earth.
{126285}{126374}Such a dark and horrible dream.
{126376}{126408}It was brought on...
{126410}{126462}because you went|to see that butcher.
{126530}{126619}My grandmother Tzeitel,|may she rest in peace...
{126621}{126690}took the trouble to come|from the other world...
{126692}{126735}to tell us about the tailor.
{126737}{126830}All I can say is that it's for the best|and couldn't be any better.
{126831}{126885}- But, Golde...|- Amen.
{126887}{126925}Amen.
{128617}{128665}Do you like|these troublemakers?
{128667}{128745}- These Christ killers?|- Of course not.
{128747}{128841}I just meant that things have|been peaceful here.
{128946}{129002}I have other|villages to visit.
{129003}{129114}If you don't want to follow orders,|we shall get someone else who will.
{129115}{129160}No, sir.
{129162}{129212}I'll take care of it,|of course.
{131984}{132040}Quiet down!
{133132}{133197}Is this the little girl
{133199}{133292}I carried
{133294}{133410}Is this the little boy|at play
{133455}{133592}I don't remember|growing older
{133618}{133721}When did they
{133763}{133824}When did she get to be
{133826}{133919}A beauty
{133921}{134030}When did he grow|to be so tall
{134075}{134138}Wasn't it yesterday
{134139}{134270}When they were small
{134428}{134507}Sunrise, sunset
{134572}{134705}Swiftly flow the days
{134731}{134803}Seedlings turn overnight
{134805}{134887}To sunflowers
{134888}{135001}Blossoming even as we gaze
{135199}{135326}Swiftly fly the years
{135351}{135423}One season following
{135424}{135505}Another
{135507}{135590}Laden with happiness
{135591}{135666}And tears
{135802}{135862}What words of wisdom
{135863}{135965}Can I give them
{135967}{136088}How can I help|to ease their way
{136127}{136174}Now they must learn
{136176}{136278}From one another
{136279}{136396}Day by day
{136431}{136495}They look so natural
{136497}{136580}Together
{136582}{136691}Just like two|newlyweds should be
{136735}{136851}Is there a canopy in store
{136852}{136940}For me
{139700}{139735}Quiet down!
{143850}{143901}That was really beautiful.
{143945}{144004}Take your places, everybody.
{144006}{144063}Quiet! Quiet down!
{144280}{144317}The newlyweds.
{144319}{144376}Friends...
{144378}{144459}we are gathered here|to share in the joys...
{144461}{144534}of the newlyweds,|Motel and Tzeitel.
{144536}{144655}May they live together|to a ripe old age. Amen!
{144687}{144738}And now I want to say...
{144809}{144889}Please! Not here!
{144890}{144971}Now I'd like to announce|that the bride's parents...
{144973}{145029}are giving the newlyweds|the following:
{145030}{145065}a new feather bed...
{145086}{145121}two pillows...
{145122}{145185}Goose pillows.
{145186}{145240}A Sabbath tablecloth...
{145267}{145345}and a pair of candlesticks.
{145384}{145438}Quiet!
{145440}{145558}Now, we are just here on earth|for a short visit.
{145560}{145654}Even the great|and wealthy must die.
{145656}{145777}In fact, if the rich could|hire others to die for them...
{145779}{145865}we, the poor, would all|make a nice living.
{145891}{145923}Well put.
{145982}{146069}Lazar Wolf.|Talking about the rich.
{146071}{146173}There sits our|good friend Lazar Wolf.
{146174}{146241}Lazar has everything|in the world...
{146242}{146289}except a bride.
{146334}{146415}But Lazar has|no ill feelings.
{146417}{146511}In fact, he has|a gift for the newlyweds...
{146513}{146559}that he himself|wants to announce.
{146561}{146633}Come on, Lazar.
{146713}{146762}Just like he said...
{146764}{146839}I have no ill feelings.
{146841}{146931}What's done is done.
{146933}{147061}I am giving the newlyweds|five chickens...
{147063}{147149}one for each of the first|five Sabbaths...
{147151}{147224}of their wedded life.
{147418}{147529}Reb Lazar Wolf,|you are a decent man...
{147531}{147580}and on behalf|of my daughter...
{147582}{147661}and her new husband...
{147663}{147700}I accept your gift.
{147728}{147805}There is a famous|saying that...
{147807}{147865}I am not marrying your daughter.
{147867}{147929}I don't have to listen|to your sayings.
{147930}{148007}- If you would only listen...|- Why should I listen?
{148009}{148111}A man who breaks an agreement...|I have a right to talk!
{148113}{148169}What right?|It's not your wedding.
{148170}{148206}It should have been!
{148207}{148250}But it's not, thank goodness.
{148252}{148317}- Don't shame Tevye...|- He shamed me...
{148318}{148379}in front of the whole village.
{148381}{148416}He shamed me!
{148502}{148548}Rabbi, say something.
{148574}{148613}I say...
{148615}{148647}Yeah.
{148649}{148716}I say let's sit down.
{148766}{148865}Yes. Well, we all heard|the words of the rabbi.
{148866}{148903}Let's sit down.
{148905}{148981}Now I'm going|to sing a little song.
{149196}{149244}I don't want that.|Leave me alone.
{149326}{149387}You can keep your|diseased chickens!
{149389}{149460}You leave my chickens|out of this!
{149462}{149543}- We made a bargain!|- The terms weren't settled!
{149545}{149582}We drank on it!
{149608}{149653}Just sit down, all right?
{149655}{149710}Once a butcher,|always a butcher.
{149712}{149796}- Once a liar, always a liar.|- Sit down!
{149798}{149903}Those happen to be my chickens.|That man...
{149905}{149942}I had a sign!
{149944}{150020}Quiet, I'm singing.
{150023}{150108}Quiet!
{150108}{150160}What's all|the screaming about?
{150162}{150224}"They drank on it."|"An agreement."
{150225}{150297}"A sign."|It's all nonsense.
{150298}{150367}Tzeitel wanted to marry|Motel and not Lazar.
{150369}{150425}A young girl|decides for herself?
{150426}{150478}Why not?|They love each other.
{150480}{150526}- Love?|- Terrible.
{150528}{150591}- He's a radical.|- Musicians, play.
{150593}{150675}It's a dance. Everybody dance.
{150677}{150727}- It's a wedding!|- Some wedding.
{150729}{150804}- What is he doing?|- Who will dance with me?
{150845}{150900}- That's a sin.|- It's no sin to dance.
{150901}{150942}- But with a girl?|- Yes!
{150944}{151019}That's what comes of taking a wild man|into your house.
{151021}{151114}He's not a wild man!|He is a little bit different.
{151116}{151162}- Come on.|- It's a sin.
{151164}{151225}It's no sin.|Ask the rabbi.
{151227}{151282}Go on, ask him.
{151317}{151363}Well, rabbi?
{151365}{151411}Dancing?
{151413}{151532}- It's not exactly forbidden, but...|- Well, there you see!
{151534}{151597}- It's not forbidden!|- And it's no sin.
{151599}{151660}Now, who will dance with me?
{151827}{151874}He's asking her to dance!
{151989}{152058}It's only a dance, Mama.
{152125}{152172}Play!
{152337}{152375}Say something.
{152574}{152612}She's dancing with a man!
{152614}{152697}I can see that she's|dancing with a man!
{152783}{152849}And I'm going to dance|with my wife!
{152914}{152952}Mama, no!
{153123}{153157}- No, I will not.|- Tzeitel!
{153346}{153432}See that? You are|responsible for that...
{153433}{153484}and I can't stand it!
{153485}{153508}I tried my best!
{153749}{153807}Everybody dance!
{154277}{154336}Come on!|Dance, rabbi, dance!
{156258}{156305}All right! Enough!
{156452}{156488}I said enough!
{156490}{156528}Come!
{156927}{157009}Orders are orders,|you understand?
{157897}{157935}Well...
{157986}{158057}why are you all|standing around?
{158090}{158128}Clean up!
{162994}{163051}Tradition
{163888}{163960}Troubles, troubles.
{163997}{164053}That's all you hear from me, right?
{164079}{164166}But who else|can we simple people...
{164168}{164229}take our troubles to?
{164271}{164339}You know, sometimes I wonder.
{164340}{164399}Who do you take your troubles to?
{164496}{164543}Go away.
{164689}{164799}Anyway, Motel and Tzeitel|have been married for some time now.
{164859}{164905}They work very hard.
{164931}{164980}And...
{164982}{165060}they're as poor|as squirrels in winter.
{165109}{165224}But they're so happy|they don't know how miserable they are.
{165392}{165464}Motel keeps talking|about a sewing machine.
{165489}{165579}I know.|You are very busy now.
{165580}{165640}Wars, revolutions,|floods, plagues...
{165642}{165768}all those little things|that bring people back to you.
{165770}{165896}But couldn't you take a second|and get him his sewing machine?
{165926}{166032}And while you're in the neighborhood...
{166059}{166149}as you can see,|my horse's leg is...
{166151}{166205}Am I bothering you too much?
{166207}{166247}I'm sorry.
{166248}{166308}As the Good Book says...
{166337}{166434}Why should I tell you|what the Good Book says?
{166612}{166673}So you must go away?
{166675}{166722}Yes.
{166724}{166780}So soon?
{166782}{166828}Yes.
{166829}{166876}Tomorrow morning.
{166996}{167053}- Alone?|- No. With a few friends.
{167055}{167095}We'll be joining others.
{167096}{167143}- Where?|- In the city... Kiev.
{167181}{167288}Hodel, there are some things|I cannot tell even you.
{167326}{167372}I see.
{167403}{167443}Don't be upset.
{167445}{167509}Why should I be upset?|If you must leave, you must.
{167511}{167549}I do have to.
{167551}{167644}- So you've told me.|- Great changes are about to take place.
{167645}{167692}Tremendous changes.
{167693}{167751}But they can't happen|by themselves.
{167752}{167799}So you feel that you personally...
{167800}{167851}Not only me!|Many people!
{167852}{167959}Jews, Gentiles... many people hate|what's going on. Don't you understand?
{167960}{168026}I understand, of course.
{168028}{168066}You want to leave.
{168092}{168151}Then good-bye.
{168177}{168221}Hodel, listen to me!
{168223}{168288}I have work to do.
{168290}{168351}The greatest work|a man can do.
{168417}{168464}Don't you understand?
{168513}{168556}Yes, Perchik.
{168745}{168797}Wait!
{168799}{168839}There's a question...
{168841}{168905}a certain question|I wish to discuss with you.
{168907}{168970}- Yes?|- It's a political question.
{168972}{169055}- What is it?|- The question of marriage.
{169147}{169211}Is this a political question?
{169213}{169261}Well, yes.
{169263}{169332}Everything's political.
{169333}{169407}Like everything else, the relationship|between a man and a woman...
{169408}{169466}has a socioeconomic base.
{169513}{169637}Marriage must be founded|on mutual beliefs.
{169639}{169700}A common attitude|and philosophy towards society.
{169702}{169765}And affection?
{169767}{169830}Well, yes. Of course.
{169832}{169878}That is also necessary.
{169904}{170018}Such a relationship|can have positive social values.
{170020}{170119}When two people face the world|with unity and solidarity...
{170121}{170163}And affection!
{170164}{170235}Yes, that is an important element!
{170315}{170367}At any rate, l...
{170368}{170488}I personally am in favor|of such a socioeconomic relationship.
{170569}{170616}I think...
{170652}{170711}you're asking me to marry you.
{170762}{170803}Well...
{170805}{170860}in a theoretical sense.
{170862}{170905}Yes, I am.
{170960}{171004}I was hoping you were.
{171106}{171167}I'm very happy, Hodel.
{171193}{171255}I'm very, very happy.
{171991}{172074}- Good afternoon.|- Good afternoon, Reb Tevye.
{172076}{172123}I have some bad news.
{172125}{172183}- What?|- I must leave here.
{172184}{172250}- When?|- Tomorrow morning.
{172252}{172330}I'm sorry to hear that.
{172332}{172403}- We'll all miss you.|- But I also have some good news.
{172404}{172462}- Good.|- You can congratulate me.
{172463}{172532}- Congratulations. What for?|- We are engaged.
{172556}{172616}- Engaged?|- Yes, Papa. We're engaged.
{172618}{172661}No, you're not.
{172663}{172744}I know. You like him,|and he likes you.
{172746}{172837}But you're going away,|and you're staying here.
{172839}{172912}So have a nice trip.|I hope you'll be happy.
{172914}{173000}- And my answer is no!|- Please, Papa. You don't understand.
{173002}{173041}I understand.
{173043}{173168}I gave permission to Motel and Tzeitel,|so you feel you also have a right.
{173170}{173248}I'm sorry. I like you.
{173250}{173325}But you're going away.|So go in good health.
{173327}{173419}- And my answer is still no!|- You don't understand.
{173420}{173478}And you are not listening.|I said no!
{173479}{173554}Reb Tevye,|we're not asking for your permission.
{173556}{173616}Only for your blessing.
{173642}{173698}We are going to get married.
{173855}{173949}You are not asking|for my permission?
{174003}{174080}But we would like your blessing, Papa.
{174187}{174255}I can't believe my own ears.
{174257}{174320}My blessing? For what?
{174322}{174368}For going over my head
{174370}{174425}Impossible
{174427}{174473}At least with Tzeitel and Motel
{174475}{174520}They asked me|They begged me
{174522}{174563}But now, if I like it or not
{174565}{174614}You'll marry him
{174615}{174656}What do you want from me
{174658}{174704}Go on|Be wed
{174706}{174814}And tear out my beard|and uncover my head
{174893}{174938}Tradition
{174939}{174995}And not even asking permission
{174997}{175052}From the papa
{175054}{175109}What's happening to the tradition
{175111}{175162}One little time|I pulled out a thread
{175163}{175220}And where has it led
{175222}{175279}Where has it led? To this!
{175281}{175345}A man tells me he's getting married!
{175347}{175393}He doesn't ask me. He tells me!
{175395}{175450}But first he abandons you.
{175452}{175499}He's not abandoning me!
{175501}{175578}As soon as I can,|I'll send for her and marry her.
{175604}{175645}I love her.
{175718}{175780}He loves her.
{175795}{175837}Love.
{175839}{175880}It's a new style.
{175906}{175948}On the other hand...
{175950}{176026}our old ways|were once new, weren't they?
{176059}{176142}On the other hand,|they decided without parents...
{176144}{176195}without the matchmaker!
{176223}{176271}One the other hand...
{176273}{176343}did Adam and Eve|have a matchmaker?
{176395}{176456}Yes, they did.
{176486}{176578}And it seems these two|have the same matchmaker.
{176699}{176758}They're going over my head.
{176759}{176820}Unheard of. Absurd!
{176822}{176895}For this, they want to be blessed
{176897}{176964}Unthinkable
{176966}{177032}I'll lock her up in her room
{177034}{177103}I couldn't|I should
{177104}{177189}But look at my daughter's eyes
{177191}{177247}She loves him
{177336}{177424}Tradition
{177563}{177693}Well, children. I've decided to give you|my blessing and my permission!
{177744}{177791}Thank you, Papa!
{177840}{177918}- What else could I do?|- Thank you, Papa.
{178033}{178095}What am I going to tell your mother?
{178097}{178143}Another dream?
{178212}{178252}Perhaps if you tell her...
{178254}{178302}that I'm going to visit a rich uncle!
{178303}{178413}Perchik, please!|I can handle my own wife!
{178621}{178698}- Hello, Golde.|- Have some soup.
{178859}{178934}I have something|very important to tell you.
{178936}{178977}Have the soup.
{178979}{179029}It's warm.
{179199}{179306}- I've just met Perchik and Hodel.|- Well?
{179433}{179518}Well, they seem to be|very fond of each other.
{179520}{179577}So? What do you mean?
{179579}{179613}So...
{179695}{179828}So, I've decided to give them|my permission to become engaged.
{179830}{179875}- I'll eat later...|- What?
{179877}{179956}Just like that?|Without even asking me?
{179958}{180038}Who asks you?
{180039}{180107}- I'm the father!|- Who is he?
{180109}{180203}A pauper! He has absolutely nothing!
{180279}{180337}I wouldn't say that!
{180403}{180497}I hear he has a rich uncle.
{180499}{180545}A rich uncle!
{180755}{180801}Golde, he's a good man.
{180831}{180935}I like him. He's a little crazy,|but I like him.
{180965}{181058}And what's more important...
{181109}{181155}Hodel likes him.
{181190}{181230}Hodel loves him.
{181307}{181353}So what can we do?
{181423}{181473}It's a new world.
{181631}{181665}Love.
{181826}{181884}Do you love me
{181886}{181922}Do I what?
{181952}{182020}Do you love me
{182022}{182077}Do I love you
{182079}{182115}Well?
{182117}{182220}With our daughters getting married|and this trouble in the town
{182222}{182318}You're upset, you're worn-out|Go inside, go lie down
{182320}{182376}Maybe it's indigestion.
{182378}{182456}No, Golde.|I'm asking you a question.
{182482}{182547}Do you love me
{182549}{182626}- You're a fool!|- I know.
{182627}{182706}But do you love me
{182707}{182790}- Do I love you|- Well?
{182791}{182860}For 25 years|I've washed your clothes
{182862}{182925}Cooked your meals|cleaned your house
{182927}{182997}Given you children|milked your cow
{182999}{183100}After 25 years|why talk about love right now
{183163}{183272}The first time I met you|was on our wedding day
{183274}{183327}- I was scared|- I was shy
{183329}{183406}- I was nervous|- So was I
{183407}{183544}But my father and my mother|said we'd learn to love each other
{183546}{183622}And now I'm asking|Golde
{183624}{183686}Do you love me
{183688}{183759}- I'm your wife|- I know!
{183761}{183833}But do you love me
{183861}{183955}- Do I love him|- Well?
{183985}{184046}For 25 years|I've lived with him
{184048}{184122}Fought with him|starved with him
{184124}{184219}Twenty-five years|my bed is his
{184221}{184312}If that's not love, what is
{184314}{184405}Then you love me
{184407}{184472}I suppose I do
{184531}{184660}And I suppose I love you too
{184719}{184799}It doesn't change a thing
{184825}{184903}But even so
{184932}{185018}After 25 years
{185091}{185186}It's nice to
{185188}{185248}Know
{185892}{185930}Halt!
{186105}{186202}There is no authority|above the will of the people.
{186204}{186252}And we are the people!
{186253}{186343}We are Russia!
{186392}{186487}The time has come,|and the time is now.
{186516}{186604}We stand here before you,|not one, but many.
{186606}{186726}Many, like you...|students, workers...
{186728}{186804}striving for a better life.
{186806}{186872}And I urge you, fellow workers...
{186874}{186937}to band together with us.
{186939}{186992}Join our movement.|In the factories!
{187048}{187163}In the schools!|In the army!
{187165}{187223}The winds of freedom...
{187225}{187312}are beginning to blow|all over Russia!
{187781}{187831}Halt.
{188036}{188095}Wait! Stand!
{188168}{188254}Wait, fellow workers!|Don't let them break up our meeting!
{188256}{188310}We have our rights!
{188697}{188755}- So I found a girl...|- Good day to you, Esther.
{188793}{188867}She didn't like her.|Just a minute.
{188869}{188910}Tzeitel!
{188912}{188976}- Good day, Yente.|- Tzeitel!
{188978}{189096}I happened to stop in the post office|today to say hello... see what's what.
{189098}{189165}It doesn't cost anything|to be friendly.
{189167}{189226}So few people are like that.
{189252}{189367}People! I tell you,|if God lived on Earth...
{189369}{189426}people would break his windows.
{189428}{189509}- So you went to the post office?|- The postman told me...
{189511}{189579}there was a letter|for your sister Hodel.
{189580}{189649}- Thanks. I'll go get it.|- I got it.
{189651}{189723}It's from her intended, Perchik.
{189725}{189823}Hodel will be so happy. She's been|waiting to hear from him for...
{189825}{189920}- But it's opened.|- So it happened to be opened.
{190558}{190613}You don't have to wait|for the train.
{190615}{190661}You'll be late for your customers.
{190687}{190737}It's all right.
{190739}{190791}They'll just have to wait|for a while.
{191040}{191118}Is he in bad trouble...
{191120}{191171}that hero of yours?
{191260}{191295}Arrested?
{191361}{191452}- Convicted?|- Yes. But he did nothing wrong.
{191454}{191502}He cares nothing for himself.
{191504}{191550}Everything he does|is for other people.
{191552}{191663}But if he did nothing wrong,|he wouldn't be in trouble.
{191664}{191751}Oh, Papa. How can you say that?
{191752}{191821}What wrongs did Joseph do?
{191823}{191878}And Abraham? And Moses?
{191880}{191935}And they had troubles.
{191937}{192002}Yes, but...
{192004}{192095}But why won't you tell me...
{192097}{192192}where he is now,|this Joseph of yours?
{192243}{192289}It is far, Papa.
{192342}{192388}Terribly far.
{192468}{192522}He is in a settlement in Siberia.
{192649}{192775}And he asks you|to leave your father and mother...
{192777}{192866}and join him in that frozen wasteland...
{192868}{192915}and marry him there?
{192916}{192955}No, Papa.
{192957}{193021}He did not ask me to go.
{193023}{193082}I want to go.
{193084}{193134}I don't want him to be alone.
{193136}{193205}I want to help him in his work.
{193294}{193400}How can I hope to make you understand
{193402}{193458}Why I do
{193460}{193532}What I do
{193534}{193650}Why I must travel|to a distant land
{193652}{193759}Far from the home I love
{193761}{193879}Once I was happily content to be
{193881}{193939}As I was
{193941}{194009}Where I was
{194011}{194124}Close to the people|who are close to me
{194126}{194215}Here in the home I love
{194268}{194353}Who could see that a man would come
{194355}{194458}Who would change the shape|of my dreams
{194460}{194599}Helpless now|I stand with him
{194600}{194651}Watching
{194653}{194789}Older dreams grow dim
{194827}{194933}Oh, what a melancholy choice this is
{194959}{195022}Wanting home
{195024}{195080}Wanting him
{195082}{195211}Closing my heart|to every hope but his
{195212}{195316}Leaving the home I love
{195370}{195482}There where my heart|has settled long ago
{195484}{195543}I must go
{195666}{195728}Who could imagine
{195730}{195804}I'd be wandering so
{195806}{195904}Far from the home I love
{195932}{195982}Yet
{195984}{196077}There with my love
{196104}{196188}I'm home
{196737}{196799}And who, my child will there be...
{196801}{196859}to perform a marriage...
{196860}{196927}there in the wilderness?
{196928}{196978}Papa, I promise you.
{196980}{197047}We will be married under a canopy.
{197048}{197083}Yes.
{197179}{197259}No doubt, a rabbi or two...
{197260}{197314}were also arrested.
{198378}{198412}Papa!
{198452}{198528}God alone knows|when we shall see each other again.
{198575}{198674}Then we will leave it in his hands.
{199572}{199619}Take care of her.
{199695}{199762}See that she dresses warm.
{200159}{200275}Even though she only|burned his cooking...
{200277}{200335}he is permitted to divorce her!
{200337}{200444}- Just for supper?|- That's what it says.
{200446}{200506}- I'm sorry, Rabbi...|- Yes, of course.
{200508}{200558}What news of the outside world, Avram?
{200560}{200623}- It's terrible!|- Then don't tell me!
{200625}{200731}If I want bad news,|I'll read about Noah and the flood.
{200786}{200829}Tell me, Avram.
{200831}{200931}Surely somewhere|there are good things happening?
{200933}{201027}Can't you buy a paper|that prints those things?
{201029}{201109}It's not my fault!|I only read it!
{201111}{201175}- Rabbi! Did you hear the news?|- More bad news?
{201177}{201291}No! Good news!|At Motel and Tzeitel's! A new arrival!
{201482}{201566}We just heard the good news!|Mazel tov!
{201568}{201620}Thank you very much.
{201622}{201668}- It's a nice thing.|- Yes, it is.
{201670}{201718}- Very nice.|- Thank you.
{201720}{201805}- What is it?|- It's a sewing machine!
{201807}{201856}It can work twice as fast.
{201858}{201905}You got it!
{201907}{201948}I got it!
{201950}{202006}- It's beautiful.|- I know.
{202008}{202057}- Have you tried it yet?|- Look!
{202095}{202134}- Beautiful!|- I know!
{202135}{202229}And in less than a minute!|See how close and even the stitches are?
{202231}{202274}- It's beautiful!|- I know!
{202276}{202353}From now on my clothes will be perfect!
{202355}{202456}Made by machine!|No more handmade clothes!
{202483}{202527}Look, Mama!
{202597}{202651}It's wonderful!
{202689}{202723}The rabbi!
{202867}{202929}Rabbi, is there a blessing|for a sewing machine?
{202931}{203015}There is a blessing for everything.
{203239}{203341}That's your new arrival?|What is it, a boy or a girl?
{203343}{203390}Well put.
{203445}{203511}Yankeleh!
{203568}{203613}Why isn't he asleep?
{203615}{203658}Oh, Mama. But he's wonderful!
{203660}{203710}He never cries or any...
{203712}{203757}Do you want to invite bad luck?
{203804}{203863}Well, Motel!
{203894}{203944}I never thought|you'd amount to anything.
{203946}{204054}But look at you!|A baby, a new sewing machine.
{204079}{204109}You're a person.
{204140}{204207}- I'll show you how it works.|- Go, children!
{204292}{204342}First you put the cloth in, like this.
{204343}{204443}It's an amazing thing. You work it|with your foot and your hand.
{204667}{204707}Your father is coming.
{204785}{204840}Chava, let me talk to him.|Let me tell him about us.
{204842}{204902}No, Fyedka.|That would be the worst thing.
{204904}{204955}- But let me try!|- No!
{204957}{205042}I'll talk to him.|I promise.
{205214}{205261}Good afternoon, sir.
{205293}{205339}Good afternoon.
{205427}{205496}It's a cold day, isn't it?
{205632}{205666}Well...
{205716}{205763}Good day, sir.
{205804}{205875}- Good day, Chava.|- Good day.
{206012}{206103}What were you and he talking about?
{206105}{206164}Nothing. We were just talking.
{206215}{206254}Good.
{206302}{206335}Papa!
{206375}{206472}Fyedka and l... We've known each other|for a long time now.
{206474}{206518}Chaveleh...
{206520}{206578}I would be much happier...
{206579}{206673}if you would remain friends|from a distance.
{206675}{206757}You must not forget who you are...
{206759}{206809}and who that man is.
{206839}{206903}- He has a name, Papa.|- Of course.
{206904}{206971}All creatures on Earth|have a name.
{206973}{207026}Fyedka's not a creature, Papa.
{207028}{207096}- Fyedka is a man!|- Who says he isn't?
{207133}{207224}It's just that he's|a different kind of man.
{207247}{207303}As the Good Book says...
{207304}{207378}"Each shall seek his own kind."
{207380}{207485}In other words,|a bird may love a fish...
{207487}{207558}but where would they build|a home together?
{207660}{207744}- The world is changing, Papa!|- No, Chaveleh.
{207770}{207808}No.
{207810}{207870}Some things do not change for us.
{207898}{207953}Some things will never change.
{207997}{208051}We don't feel that way.
{208102}{208147}"We"?
{208149}{208250}Fyedka and I.|We want to be married.
{208252}{208352}What? Are you out of your mind?
{208353}{208400}What?
{208401}{208517}Don't you understand what that means,|marrying outside of the faith?
{208518}{208557}- But, Papa!|- No!
{208559}{208609}I said no!
{208611}{208678}Never talk about it again.
{208680}{208728}Never mention his name again.
{208730}{208778}Never see him again.
{208780}{208818}Never.
{208848}{208908}Do you understand me?
{208959}{209005}Yes, Papa.
{209039}{209106}I understand you.
{209269}{209336}You're finally here!|Let's go home. It's late.
{209337}{209385}I want to see Motel's new machine.
{209387}{209433}See it another time!|It's late!
{209435}{209481}Quiet, woman, before I get angry!
{209483}{209579}Because when I'm angry,|even flies don't dare to fly!
{209581}{209688}I'm very frightened of you.|After we finish supper I'll faint.
{209719}{209793}I am the man in the house!
{209795}{209846}I'm the head of the family!
{209848}{209958}And I want to see|Motel's new machine now!
{210105}{210156}Now let's go home!
{212293}{212340}What are you doing here?|What do you want?
{212399}{212460}May I see His Honor the Priest?
{212461}{212515}- The Reverend Father?|- Yes.
{212517}{212575}Why do you want to see him?
{212577}{212628}It's a family matter.
{212629}{212681}A personal matter.
{212719}{212801}- My daughter.|- Yes? What about your daughter?
{212802}{212858}Please, if I could speak with the pr...
{212896}{212978}If I could speak with|the Reverend Father.
{212980}{213010}Please!
{213069}{213115}Wait here.
{214309}{214357}What is it?
{214359}{214418}It's Chava.
{214420}{214468}She left home this morning...
{214469}{214507}with Fyedka.
{214509}{214531}What?
{214533}{214599}I've looked everywhere for her.
{214601}{214660}I even went to the priest.
{214751}{214810}He told me they were married.
{214923}{214962}Married?
{214964}{214998}Yes.
{215104}{215138}Well...
{215173}{215220}go home, Golde.
{215269}{215315}We have other children at home.
{215349}{215419}You have work to do.|I have work to do.
{215421}{215478}- Go home.|- But Chaveleh!
{215480}{215546}Chava is dead to us!
{215639}{215685}We'll forget her.
{215718}{215767}Go home.
{216723}{216790}Little bird
{216792}{216870}Little Chaveleh
{216872}{216958}I don't understand|what's happening today
{216960}{217038}Everything is all a blur
{217081}{217167}All I can see is a happy child
{217169}{217249}The sweet little bird you were|Chaveleh
{217434}{217481}Little bird
{217506}{217556}Little Chaveleh
{217585}{217680}You were always such|a pretty little thing
{217682}{217762}Everybody's favorite child
{217880}{217961}Gentle and kind and affectionate
{217963}{218048}What a sweet little bird you were|Chaveleh
{220259}{220294}Papa.
{220464}{220538}Papa, I've been looking|everywhere for you.
{221045}{221091}Papa, stop!
{221158}{221209}At least listen to me.
{221250}{221309}Papa!
{221310}{221368}I beg you to accept us!
{221551}{221598}Accept them?
{221627}{221678}How can I accept them?
{221726}{221785}Can I deny everything|I believe in?
{221850}{221896}On the other hand...
{221923}{221971}can I deny my own daughter?
{222140}{222196}On the other hand...
{222222}{222319}how can I turn my back on my faith?
{222321}{222367}My people?
{222419}{222500}If I try and bend that far...
{222538}{222584}I'll break.
{222672}{222718}On the other hand...
{222838}{222881}No!
{222883}{222930}There is no other hand!
{222968}{223041}No, Chava!
{223043}{223098}But, Papa!
{223679}{223812}Golde, here they are!|The boys I told you about!
{223814}{223853}Wonderful boys!
{223854}{223945}From good families!|Each of them a prize, a jewel!
{223946}{224001}You couldn't do better|for your girls.
{224002}{224087}I don't know, Yente.|My girls are still so young.
{224089}{224153}So what do they look like?|Grandfathers?
{224154}{224207}True, the marriage can wait.
{224209}{224305}But meanwhile their future|will be all signed and sealed!
{224338}{224380}Which one for which one?
{224382}{224428}What's the difference?|Take your pick.
{224430}{224473}They're both wonderful boys!
{224475}{224600}Yankel, the fat one,|is apprenticed to a carpenter.
{224602}{224673}- I'm Yankel.|- Did I ask you?
{224674}{224769}- Yankel, the skinny one, is...|- Mama, is Reb Tevye in the house?
{224771}{224827}He's in the barn.|Is there trouble?
{224855}{224909}Stay inside, children.
{224958}{225001}What is it?|What's the matter?
{225026}{225096}Tevye, have you seen|the constable lately?
{225098}{225192}- No. Why?|- There's some rumors in town.
{225194}{225266}We thought since you knew him so well...
{225268}{225334}maybe he told you what is true|and what is not.
{225336}{225409}Rumors? What rumors?
{225411}{225476}Quiet! Talk, Avram.
{225478}{225596}Someone from Zolodin said an edict|was issued in St. Petersburg that...
{225810}{225859}Welcome, Your Honor.
{225861}{225949}- What's the good news in the world?|- I see that you have company.
{226000}{226055}They are my friends.
{226057}{226103}It's just as well.
{226105}{226157}What I have to say|is for their ears also.
{226187}{226261}How much time do you need|to sell your house and household goods?
{226316}{226378}Why should I sell my house?
{226380}{226426}Is it in anybody's way?
{226428}{226499}I came to tell you|you have to leave Anatevka.
{226544}{226622}And how did I come|to deserve such an honor?
{226624}{226687}Not just you.|But all of you.
{226784}{226842}Stop it!
{226889}{226991}I thought you might be spared because|of the marriage of your daughter.
{226993}{227072}My daughter is dead.
{227074}{227151}I understand.
{227153}{227260}At any rate, it affects all of you.|You all have to leave.
{227262}{227365}But this corner of the world...
{227366}{227433}has always been our home.
{227458}{227493}Why should we leave?
{227494}{227589}I don't know why. There's trouble|in the world! Troublemakers!
{227642}{227709}- Like us?|- You aren't the only ones.
{227710}{227790}Your people must leave|all the villages: Zolodin, Rabalevka...
{227792}{227849}The entire district must be emptied!
{227874}{227919}I have an order here!
{227993}{228086}You must sell your homes|and be out in three days.
{228088}{228134}Three days! It's impossible!
{228136}{228182}The children!
{228378}{228421}And you!
{228423}{228500}You who have known us|all your life...
{228502}{228559}you'd carry out this order?
{228561}{228624}I've nothing to do with it!|Don't you understand?
{228626}{228679}I wish you wouldn't say "me"!
{228721}{228759}I understand.
{228761}{228819}Suppose we refuse to go?
{228821}{228860}You will be forced out!
{228862}{228943}- We will defend ourselves.|- We'll stay in our homes.
{228945}{228989}- We won't move!|- We'll keep our land!
{228990}{229064}- Fight!|- Against our militia? Our army?
{229066}{229179}- I wouldn't advise that!|- I have some advice for you.
{229210}{229263}Get off my land.
{229289}{229333}This is still my home...
{229359}{229405}my land.
{229406}{229461}Get off my land.
{229687}{229734}You have three days!
{230020}{230080}After a lifetime...
{230082}{230149}a piece of paper,|and get thee out.
{230151}{230221}Let's get together|with the people of Zolodin.
{230222}{230294}- Maybe they have a plan.|- We should defend ourselves!
{230295}{230342}An eye for an eye,|and a tooth for a tooth!
{230343}{230469}Very good. That way the whole world|will be blind and toothless.
{230473}{230502}Rabbi...
{230530}{230623}we've been waiting for the Messiah|all our lives.
{230625}{230683}Wouldn't this be a good time|for him to come?
{230781}{230877}We'll have to wait for him|someplace else.
{231001}{231087}Meanwhile, let's start packing.
{231544}{231677}Well, Anatevka hasn't exactly been|the Garden of Eden.
{231679}{231724}That's true.
{231725}{231806}After all, what have we got here?
{231808}{231871}A little bit of this
{231873}{231929}A little bit of that
{231931}{231989}- A pot|- A pan
{231990}{232060}- A broom|- A hat
{232061}{232196}Someone should have set a match|to this place years ago.
{232198}{232249}- A bench|- A tree
{232251}{232324}- What's a house|- Or a stove
{232326}{232441}People who pass through Anatevka|don't even know they've been here.
{232442}{232504}A stick of wood
{232506}{232557}A piece of cloth
{232559}{232616}What do we leave
{232617}{232676}Nothing much
{232677}{232751}Only Anatevka
{232943}{233003}Underfed, overworked
{233005}{233077}Anatevka
{233079}{233154}Where else would Sabbath
{233156}{233217}Be so sweet
{233435}{233493}Intimate, obstinate
{233568}{233618}Where I know
{233620}{233706}Everyone I meet
{233795}{233885}Soon I'll be a stranger
{233887}{234002}In a strange, new place
{234037}{234084}Searching for
{234085}{234201}An old familiar face
{234203}{234308}From Anatevka
{234810}{234925}I belong in Anatevka
{234926}{234985}Tumbledown, workaday
{235062}{235141}Dear little village
{235143}{235228}Little town
{235230}{235309}Of
{235310}{235366}Mine
{235853}{235909}It's just a place.
{235911}{236051}Our forefathers have been forced out|of many places at a moment's notice.
{236053}{236101}Maybe that's why...
{236127}{236187}we always wear our hats.
{238933}{238974}Golde, darling!
{238976}{239033}I had to see you before I left.
{239034}{239083}Because I have such news for you.
{239085}{239172}You remember I told you|I didn't know where to go...
{239173}{239219}what do to with these old bones?
{239221}{239295}Now I know. You wanna hear?|I'll tell you.
{239297}{239391}All my life I've dreamed|of going to one place.
{239393}{239464}Guess where.|You'll never guess.
{239465}{239545}Every year at Passover,|what do we say?
{239547}{239605}"Next year in Jerusalem."
{239607}{239668}"Next year in the Holy Land."
{239670}{239719}You're going to the Holy Land!
{239721}{239755}You guessed.
{239757}{239820}Good-bye, Yente.
{239821}{239877}Be well...
{239878}{239928}and go in peace.
{239929}{240069}So good-bye. And sometime maybe|we'll meet on a happier occasion.
{240071}{240149}Meanwhile we suffer.|Oh, we suffer!
{240151}{240233}We suffer in silence.|Right? Of course, right.
{240235}{240286}Where are you going?
{240288}{240356}You don't know where you're going?
{240357}{240416}Come, Golde. We have to leave.
{240417}{240480}Leave. It sounds so easy.
{240481}{240564}Golde, we'll all be together soon.
{240566}{240616}Motel, Tzeitel and the baby...|they'll come too.
{240618}{240697}You'll see. This Motel is a person.
{240699}{240787}And Hodel and Perchik?|When will we ever see them again?
{240789}{240873}Do they visit us from Siberia|every Sabbath?
{240875}{240921}You know what she writes.
{240923}{240996}He sits in prison. She works.
{240998}{241070}But soon he'll be set free.
{241072}{241157}And together they'll turn the world|upside-down.
{241159}{241212}She couldn't be happier.
{241213}{241296}And the other children will be with us.
{241297}{241344}Not all.
{241377}{241412}AII!
{241565}{241612}Come, Golde.
{241613}{241697}I have to clean up.|Sweep the floor.
{241725}{241785}I don't want to leave a dirty house!
{242032}{242097}I'm on my way.
{242099}{242145}Where are you going?
{242188}{242247}Chicago, in America.
{242310}{242387}We are going to New York, America.
{242389}{242427}We'll be neighbors.
{242429}{242520}My wife, Fruma Sarah, may she|rest in peace, has a brother there.
{242521}{242581}- That's nice.|- I hate him!
{242611}{242643}But...
{242669}{242713}a relative is a relative.
{242777}{242833}- Good-bye, Tevye.|- Good-bye, Lazar Wolf.
{244376}{244448}Well, my old friends.|It's time to say good-bye.
{244631}{244704}The farmer Busenko|will be coming for you later.
{244730}{244785}He's not a bad sort.
{244815}{244881}If you are good to him,|he'll be good to you.
{244976}{245023}Take care of your leg.
{245315}{245373}Thanks for everything.
{245939}{245990}- Papa will see you.|- I want him to.
{245992}{246039}I want to say good-bye to him.
{246089}{246160}- He won't listen to you.|- But at least he will hear.
{246162}{246236}Maybe it would be better|if I told Mama.
{246723}{246758}Papa?
{247235}{247288}We came to say good-bye.
{247414}{247483}We're also leaving this place.
{247519}{247576}We're going to Krakow.
{247578}{247656}We cannot stay among people|who do such things to others.
{247763}{247810}We wanted you to know that.
{248139}{248187}Some are driven away by edicts...
{248221}{248268}others, by silence.
{248524}{248578}Good-bye, Papa.
{248631}{248669}Mama.
{248755}{248797}Come, Chava.
{249186}{249243}Good-bye, Chava, Fyedka!
{249351}{249413}And God be with you.
{249612}{249654}And God be with you.
{249656}{249720}We will write to you in America|if you like.
{249722}{249793}We will be staying with Uncle Avram!
{249795}{249841}Yes, Mama!
{250097}{250195}"We'll be staying with Uncle Avram"!
{250197}{250283}The whole world|has to know our business!
{250285}{250347}Stop yelling, and finish packing!
{250349}{250404}We have a long way to go!
{250406}{250490}Golde, I don't need your advice!
{250492}{250556}Tzeitel, don't forget the baby!
{250983}{251030}Good-bye, Papa.
{251247}{251294}Work hard, Motel.
{251319}{251384}And come to us soon.
{251386}{251432}I will, Papa.
{251471}{251518}I'll work hard.
{252403}{252449}All right, children.
{252518}{252564}Let's go.
