{3763}{3863}I don"t understand... | I just don"t understand.
{4935}{5007}Idon'tunderstanditatall.
{5076}{5114}I just don"t understand.
{5630}{5659}What"s wrong?
{5743}{5779}What don"tyou understand?
{5877}{5938}I"ve never heard | such a strange story.
{5959}{5994}Why don"tyou tell me about it?
{6033}{6140}We happen to have | a wise priest in our midst.
{6195}{6320}No, not even the renowned, | wise priest from Kiyomizu Temple
{6352}{6430}has heard a story | as strange as this.
{6436}{6537}Soyou know something | about this strange story?
{6555}{6673}This man and I havejust seen it | and heard it ourselves.
{6686}{6774}- Where? | - In the courthouse garden.
{6787}{6820}The courthouse?
{6867}{6917}A man was murdered.
{6931}{6997}Just one? So what?
{7035}{7207}On top ofthis gate, you"ll fi nd | at least five or six unclaimed bodies.
{7231}{7282}You"re right.
{7285}{7395}War, earthquake, winds,
{7428}{7526}fi re, famine, the plague...
{7530}{7606}Year afteryear, | it"s been nothing but disasters.
{7729}{7842}And bandits descend upon us | every night.
{7881}{8058}I"ve seen so many men | getting killed like insects,
{8102}{8251}but even I have never heard | a story as horrible as this.
{8397}{8482}Yes. So horrible.
{8579}{8719}This time, I may fi nally lose | my faith in the human soul.
{8751}{8852}It"s worse than bandits, | the plague,
{8863}{9015}famine, fi re, orwar.
{9040}{9099}Look here, priest.
{9117}{9169}Enough with the sermon.
{9171}{9263}It sounded interesting, | at least while I kept out ofthe rain.
{9279}{9374}But ifit"s a sermon, | I"d sooner listen to the rain.
{10136}{10267}Hear me out. Maybeyou can | tell me what it means.
{10269}{10371}I don"t understand | any ofthose three.
{10375}{10427}- Which three? | - Well...
{10447}{10522}I"ll tell you about them.
{10526}{10581}Calm down and tell me slowly.
{10618}{10695}The rain"s not going to stop | any time soon.
{10722}{10782}RASHOMON
{11184}{11228}It was three days ago.
{11246}{11337}I went into the mountains | to get wood.
{16661}{16717}Iranas fastas Icould | to tell thepolice.
{16742}{16845}Then, three days later-- today-- | I was calledto testify.
{16907}{16972}Yes. That"s right.
{17068}{17203}I was the one | who fi rst found the body.
{17210}{17287}What? Did I see a sword | or something?
{17289}{17356}No, nothing at all.
{17410}{17477}Just a woman"s hat | caught on a branch,
{17510}{17594}and the cap ofa samurai | that had been trampled on.
{17611}{17698}There was a cut-up piece ofrope | near the body,
{17742}{17915}and further along in the leaves, | a shiny amulet case with red lining.
{17918}{17958}Yes.
{17991}{18125}That was all I found, yes.
{18164}{18203}Yes.
{18244}{18359}I met the murdered man | before his death.
{18387}{18525}It was three days ago, | in the afternoon.
{18569}{18671}On the road from Sekiyama | to Yamashina.
{19103}{19258}The womanhada veil, | so Icouldn'tseeherface.
{19287}{19449}Theman was armedwith asword, | as wellas abowandarrows.
{19544}{19712}Little did I expect | that he would meet such a fate.
{19770}{19930}A human life is truly as frail | and feeting as the morning dew.
{19993}{20090}What a shame | that his should end this way.
{20099}{20160}I"m sorry.
{20250}{20356}This man I caught is Tajomaru.
{20385}{20506}Yes, the notorious bandit | everyone speaks of.
{20567}{20683}The last time I almost caught him, | he looked the same
{20687}{20744}and he carried that same sword.
{20802}{20903}It was two days ago at dusk, | by the banks ofthe Katsura...
{21312}{21404}What"s wrong?
{21674}{21767}There were 17arrows | with eagle feathers,
{21769}{21878}aleatherbow, andahorse.
{21899}{21993}All these belonged | to the dead man, yes.
{22044}{22172}The irony ofTajomaru being | thrown off his stolen horse,
{22184}{22238}this had to be fateful retribution.
{22439}{22541}I fell off the horse? | You fool!
{22646}{22681}On that day...
{22903}{22965}I was riding that horse | and I was suddenlyvery thirsty.
{22999}{23050}So around Osaka, | I drank from a spring.
{23367}{23433}There must have been | a dead poisonous snake upstream.
{23447}{23524}After a while, I got | an incredible stomachache.
{23546}{23654}By the time I came to the river, | I couldn"t hold it any longer.
{23682}{23773}So I got off the horse | and crouched in the field.
{23895}{23954}I fell off?
{23980}{24032}Obviously, a fool can think only | foolish thoughts.
{24111}{24191}I know sooner or later | you"ll have my neck,
{24218}{24267}so I"m not going to hide anything.
{24341}{24404}It was this Tajomaru | who killed that man.
{24483}{24568}I saw that couple three days ago. | It was a hot afternoon.
{24591}{24677}Suddenly a cool breeze | rustled the leaves.
{24711}{24824}Ifit hadn"t been for that wind, | I wouldn"t have killed him.
{28519}{28620}I caught a glimpse | and then she was gone.
{28647}{28691}Maybe that"s why.
{28703}{28782}I thought I saw a goddess.
{28797}{28875}At that moment I decided to capture her, | even ifI had to kill her man.
{28961}{29083}But ifI could have her | without killing, all the better.
{29095}{29218}My intention then was to take her | without killing the man.
{29275}{29356}But I couldn"t do it | on that road to Yamashina.
{29769}{29795}What doyou want?
{30122}{30147}What doyou want?
{30418}{30444}What is it?
{30943}{30985}Don"t be suspicious.
{31071}{31122}See? Isn"t this nice?
{31194}{31231}Take a good look at it.
{31406}{31493}There are some ruins over there.
{31518}{31656}When I dug up the mound, I found | a heap ofswords and mirrors.
{31674}{31771}I buried them in a grove behind the mountain | so no one else would fi nd them.
{31815}{31890}Ifyou"re interested, | I"ll sell them toyou cheap.
{34185}{34218}It"s over there.
{34287}{34317}Walk ahead ofme.
{35394}{35463}It"s here. Beyond those pines.
{38208}{38306}Your husband | has taken sick.
{38499}{38666}Her face turned pale. | She stared at me with frozen eyes,
{38673}{38760}her expression intense like a child"s.
{38795}{38902}When I saw that, I envied the man | and I suddenly hated him.
{38923}{39022}I wanted to show her how pathetic | he looked tied to that pine tree.
{39035}{39140}These thoughts that weren"t there | before fi lled my head.
{41418}{41474}Ihadneverseen | such fierceness in a woman.
{44910}{45015}And so I had succeeded in having her | without killing her husband.
{45129}{45241}I still had no intention | ofkilling him.
{45284}{45321}But then...
{45369}{45409}Wait!
{45444}{45482}Stop!
{45505}{45613}Eitheryou die or my husband dies.
{45632}{45685}One ofyou must die.
{45943}{46069}To have my shame known to two men | is worse than dying.
{46149}{46349}I will go with the survivor.
{50553}{50623}So I had to kill him, | but I wanted to do it honorably.
{50637}{50742}He fought verywell. | We crossed swords 23 times.
{50771}{50883}I remember this | because I"m still impressed.
{50903}{50986}No one had ever crossed swords | with me more than 20 times.
{51093}{51156}What? The woman?
{51211}{51262}I don"t know.
{51275}{51411}When the man died, | I turned to her. She was gone.
{51450}{51555}The fighting must have scared her | and she ran away.
{51579}{51642}I ran out to the mountain road.
{51646}{51717}All I found was her horse | grazing calmly.
{51756}{51848}I was attracted to her fierce spirit,
{51852}{51946}but, after all, she wasjust | like otherwomen.
{51961}{52007}I didn"t even look for her.
{52085}{52147}What? His sword?
{52194}{52254}I exchanged it in town for liquor.
{52295}{52363}What? Her dagger?
{52425}{52575}It had pearl inlay. | Looked veryvaluable.
{52599}{52722}I totally forgot about it. | That was foolish.
{52740}{52787}The biggest mistake I ever made!
{53323}{53459}Even amongst the bandits, | Tajomaru is famous for being a womanizer.
{53503}{53627}Why, last fall, a young wife went | to the temple and she and her maid
{53631}{53768}were found dead in the mountains. | That must have been him too.
{53934}{54040}Who knows what really happened | to that woman who left her horse?
{54189}{54266}Well, that woman showed up | at the courthouse.
{54349}{54494}She was hiding in the temple | when the police found her.
{54499}{54537}It"s a lie.
{54557}{54646}It"s all a lie. | Tajomaru"s story and the woman"s.
{54675}{54727}It"s human to lie.
{54832}{54911}Most ofthe time we can"t even | be honest with ourselves.
{54915}{54957}That may be.
{55100}{55306}But it"s because men are weak | that they lie, even to themselves.
{55311}{55357}Not another sermon.
{55381}{55485}I don"t care ifit"s a lie, | as long as it"s entertaining.
{55561}{55614}What story did the woman | come up with?
{55645}{55763}Well, it"s completely different | from Tajomaru"s story.
{55818}{55996}So different that her face didn"t even | show the fierceness he spoke of.
{56173}{56245}She was so docile, | she was almost pitiful.
{56943}{56991}That man in the blue kimono,
{57074}{57142}after forcing me toyield to him,
{57174}{57306}proudly announced that | he was the infamous Tajomaru,
{57383}{57487}and laughed mockingly at my husband | who was tied up.
{57753}{57938}How horrified my husband | must have been.
{58023}{58098}The more he struggled,
{58165}{58339}the tighter the ropes dug in.
{58413}{58571}I ran to his side. Or rather, I tried to.
{61169}{61312}Even now, when I think ofhis eyes,
{61348}{61442}my blood turns cold in myveins.
{61534}{61639}What I saw in them was neither anger,
{61674}{61709}nor sorrow,
{61747}{61958}but a cold light, a look ofloathing.
{62141}{62181}Don"t.
{62201}{62252}Don"t look at me like that.
{62375}{62407}It"s too cruel.
{62448}{62498}Beat me,
{62522}{62684}kill me, but don"t look at me like that. | Please, stop.
{64713}{64765}Now kill me.
{64791}{64848}Kill me at once.
{65667}{65702}Stop.
{65739}{65788}Don"t.
{65910}{65948}Please don"t.
{67002}{67142}I must have fainted after that.
{67371}{67433}When I came to | and looked around...
{67639}{67700}Imagine my shock.
{68103}{68301}I saw my dagger | in my dead husband"s chest.
{68652}{68735}I was in shock
{68808}{68878}and I don"t remember | how I left the woods.
{69027}{69081}But when I came to,
{69173}{69220}I was standing by the pond,
{69261}{69303}at the foot ofthe hill.
{69481}{69532}I threw myselfinto the pond.
{69585}{69680}I tried many different things.
{69724}{69828}But I failed to kill myself.
{70126}{70400}What should a poor, | helpless woman like me do?
{71255}{71335}I see. The more I hear, | the more confused I get.
{71405}{71482}But women use their tears | to fool everyone.
{71498}{71541}They even fool themselves.
{71579}{71657}Soyou have to beware | ofthe woman"s story.
{71711}{71767}When you hear | the dead man"s story--
{71789}{71910}He"s dead. | How can he tell his story?
{71933}{71977}He spoke through a medium.
{72025}{72115}Lies. His storywas also lies.
{72183}{72283}But dead men don"t lie.
{72307}{72348}Why is that?
{72396}{72467}I refuse to believe | that man would be so sinful.
{72507}{72541}Suityourself.
{72567}{72613}But is there anyone who"s | really good?
{72634}{72703}Maybe goodness isjust make-believe.
{72706}{72760}What a frightening--
{72778}{72839}Manjust wants to forget | the bad stuff
{72861}{72914}and believe in the made-up | good stuff.
{72923}{72979}It"s easier that way. | - Ridiculous.
{73071}{73109}Nevermind.
{73111}{73177}Let"s hear the dead man"s story.
{74319}{74399}I am in darkness now.
{74401}{74507}I am suffering in the dark.
{74528}{74644}Cursed be those who cast me | into this dark hell.
{75558}{75726}After the bandit attacked mywife, | he tried to console her.
{75764}{75890}Shesaton theleaves, | staring down atherknees.
{75924}{75990}Thebandit was cunning.
{76015}{76071}Nowthather virtue was stained,
{76075}{76135}she couldnolongerbe | with herhusband.
{76139}{76218}Leave thehusband | andwhynotmarryhim instead?
{76234}{76322}He saidhe onlyattackedher | outofhis love forher.
{76364}{76474}Whensheheard that, | my wife raisedherfaceas ifin a trance.
{76634}{76768}She had never looked so beautiful.
{76930}{77090}Andwhat was mybeautiful wife's | response to thebandit
{77123}{77171}in frontofherhelpless husband?
{77255}{77296}Wherever.
{77363}{77422}Take me whereveryou want.
{77470}{77522}That"s what she said.
{77601}{77662}But that wasn"t her only sin
{77683}{77782}or I wouldn"t be suffering | in the dark like this.
{78147}{78186}Please kill him.
{78200}{78265}While he"s alive, | I cannot go with you.
{78291}{78329}Kill him!
{78371}{78468}Those words were like a wind that
{78478}{78557}threatened to blow me | into the depths ofdarkness.
{78684}{78870}Has such a hateful thing | ever been uttered by a human before?
{78883}{78974}Even the bandit turned pale | at those words.
{79011}{79122}Please kill him.
{79971}{80046}What doyou want me | to do with her?
{80081}{80199}Kill her or save her? | You only have to nod.
{80296}{80444}Forthese words alone, | I was ready topardonhis crime.
{80520}{80653}Kill her or let her go?
{81340}{81407}Idon'tknow | howmanyhourspassed.
{82439}{82530}She got away. Now I"ll have | to worry about my own fate.
{83161}{83206}Everything was silent.
{83251}{83336}Iheardsomeone crying.
{83362}{83424}Someoneis crying.
{83443}{83488}Whois that?
{86984}{87023}Everything was silent.
{87076}{87124}How quiet it was.
{87173}{87231}Suddenly the sun went away.
{87287}{87381}I was enveloped in deep silence.
{87451}{87567}I lay there in the stillness.
{87638}{87758}Then someone quietly approached me.
{87787}{88035}That someone gentlywithdrew | the dagger from my heart.
{88737}{88776}It"s not true!
{88779}{88874}There was no dagger. | He was killed by a sword.
{89798}{89846}Now it"s getting interesting.
{89869}{89978}It seems you saw the whole thing.
{90095}{90148}So why didn"tyou tell the court?
{90190}{90235}I didn"t want to get involved.
{90254}{90294}You can talk about it here, right?
{90335}{90399}Tell me, then.
{90402}{90453}Your story seems to be | the most interesting.
{90459}{90553}I don"t want to hear it. | No more horror stories.
{90587}{90647}They are common stories | these days.
{90659}{90731}I even heard that the demon living | here in Rashomon
{90735}{90796}fed in fear ofthe ferocity ofman.
{90894}{90985}Come on. | How much doyou know?
{91119}{91199}I found the woman"s hat | in the mountains.
{91207}{91250}You already said that.
{91314}{91426}About 20 yards further, | I heard a woman crying.
{91457}{91559}From behind a bush, | I saw a man tied up,
{91568}{91642}a woman crying and Tajomaru.
{91683}{91787}Soyou lied when you said | you found the body.
{91790}{91837}I didn"t want to get involved.
{91839}{91878}All right, then.
{91916}{92024}Go on. | What was Tajomaru doing?
{92123}{92238}He was down on his knees, | begging the woman for forgiveness.
{92309}{92420}until now, whenever I wanted | to do something bad, I did it.
{92427}{92487}That way I suffered less.
{92522}{92583}But today, it"s different.
{92587}{92717}I already had you, but I only | wantyou more. It"s very hard.
{92741}{92797}I beg you to be mywife.
{92903}{93071}The notorious bandit Tajomaru | is begging you on his hands and knees.
{93179}{93258}Ifyou wish, I"ll even stop | being a bandit.
{93279}{93347}I have enough stashed away | to giveyou a lavish life.
{93379}{93476}And ifyou don"t want my dirty money, | I"ll even work.
{93490}{93640}I"ll stoop to selling odds and ends | on the street to supportyou.
{93656}{93737}I"ll do anything | ifyou come with me.
{93739}{93806}Marry me, please.
{93862}{93976}Ifyou say no, | I have no choice but to kill you.
{94014}{94071}Please, sayyes.
{94171}{94232}Stop crying and answer me.
{94249}{94288}Tell meyou"ll be mywife!
{94306}{94370}Say it!
{94651}{94690}It"s impossible.
{94733}{94855}How could I, a woman, | say anything?
{95347}{95426}I get it. You mean | it"s up to us men to decide.
{95500}{95530}Hold it!
{95563}{95662}I refuse to risk my life | for such a woman.
{96336}{96412}You"ve been with two men. | Why don"tyou kill yourself?
{96564}{96592}Hopeless.
{96686}{96770}I don"t want this shameless whore. | You can have her.
{96816}{96928}At this stage, I"d rather lose her | instead ofthe horse.
{98263}{98317}- Wait! | - Don"t follow me!
{98647}{98734}Stop crying. | It"s not going to work anymore.
{98797}{98879}Stop it. Don"t bully her.
{98897}{98955}Women are weak by nature.
{99609}{99645}It"s you who are weak.
{99723}{99767}Ifyou are my husband,
{99794}{99854}why don"tyou kill this man?
{99878}{99941}Then you can tell me to kill myself. | That"s a real man.
{99997}{100050}You"re not a real man either.
{100256}{100339}When I heard you were Tajomaru, | I stopped crying.
{100355}{100411}I was sick ofthis tiresome daily farce.
{100451}{100590}I thought, ""Tajomaru might | get me out ofthis.""
{100599}{100732}""Ifhe"d only save me, | I"d do anything for him.""
{100735}{100780}I thought to myself.
{100899}{100978}Butyou werejust as petty | as my husband.
{101020}{101140}Just remember: A woman loves a man | who loves passionately.
{101162}{101231}A man has to make a woman his | by his sword.
{109395}{109454}I don"t want to die!
{113459}{113510}So that"s the real story.
{113526}{113590}I don"t tell lies. | I saw it with my own eyes.
{113602}{113637}I doubt it.
{113647}{113710}It"s true. I don"t lie.
{113715}{113762}No one lies after he says | he"s going to do so.
{113766}{113810}It"s horrifying.
{113813}{113880}Ifmen don"t trust each other, | this earth might as well be hell.
{113886}{113923}That"s right. This world is hell.
{113927}{113968}No, I believe in men.
{114022}{114071}I don"t want this place to be hell.
{114094}{114142}Shouting doesn"t help.
{114163}{114252}Think about it. Out ofthese three, | whose story is believable?
{114263}{114345}No idea.
{114381}{114478}In the end, you cannot understand | the things men do.
{115975}{116015}What areyou doing?
{116115}{116148}What"s it toyou?
{116225}{116282}- That"s terrible! | - Terrible?
{116296}{116404}Someone else would have taken | the kimono. Why shouldn"t I?
{116445}{116503}- It"s evil. | - Evil?
{116526}{116579}What about this kid"s parents?
{116598}{116730}They had their fun and then they | throw out the kid? They"re evil.
{116748}{116804}No, you"re wrong.
{116832}{116972}Look at the amulet on the kimono. | It was left to protect the baby.
{116995}{117062}Think about what theywent through | to abandon this baby.
{117074}{117126}I don"t have time to mind | everyone"s feelings.
{117130}{117187}- You selfish... | - What"s wrong with that?
{117210}{117268}Dogs are better off in this world.
{117288}{117362}Ifyou"re not selfish, | you can"t survive.
{117584}{117635}Damn it.
{117655}{117723}Everyone is selfish and dishonest.
{117743}{117815}Making excuses.
{117843}{118041}The bandit, the woman, | the man and you!
{118193}{118280}And you aren"t? That"s funny.
{118301}{118404}You may have fooled the court, | but not me.
{118809}{118868}So what did you do | with the dagger?
{118888}{118966}The valuable one | with the pearl inlay
{118975}{119022}that Tajomaru was talking about?
{119033}{119098}What happened to it? | Did it disappear in the grass?
{119124}{119208}Ifyou didn"t, who stole it?
{119303}{119344}It seems I"m right.
{119427}{119534}A bandit calling another a bandit. | Now that"s selfish.
{119871}{119938}Doyou have anything else to say?
{119968}{120010}Ifnot, I"ll be going.
{121875}{121951}What areyou doing? | Taking what little it has left?
{122206}{122299}I have six kids ofmy own.
{122343}{122513}Another one | wouldn"t make a difference.
{122691}{122840}I am ashamed ofwhat I said.
{122923}{123110}It"s inevitable to be suspicious ofothers | on a day like this.
{123211}{123259}I"m the one | who should be ashamed.
{123313}{123420}I don"t understand my own soul.
{123433}{123506}No, I"m grateful toyou.
{123819}{123866}Thanks toyou,
{123889}{124050}I think I can keep | my faith in man.
{124079}{124118}Don"t mention it.
{126445}{126554}THE END
