1
00:01:17,747 --> 00:01:28,247
RAISE THE RED LANTERN

2
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:36,043
Mother, stop!

3
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,810
You've been talking for three days.

4
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:42,827
I've thought it over.

5
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:45,005
Alright, I'll get married.

6
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:49,327
Good! To what sort of man?

7
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:53,267
What sort of man? Is it up to me?

8
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:59,397
You always speak of money.
Why not marry a rich man?

9
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:04,827
Marry a rich man and you'll
only be his concubine.

10
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:12,321
Let me be a concubine.

11
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,890
Isn't that a woman's fate?

12
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:49,360
SUMMER

13
00:04:52,087 --> 00:04:54,087
Miss, looking for someone?

14
00:04:57,902 --> 00:05:01,402
I'm Songlian. We met once, remember?

15
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,230
It's our Fourth Mistress! Please wait.

16
00:05:12,744 --> 00:05:16,244
We sent the bridal sedan for you.
Didn't it arrive?

17
00:05:16,744 --> 00:05:18,744
I walked here myself.

18
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,918
- Let me carry it.
- I can manage.

19
00:05:52,722 --> 00:05:56,222
Wait here. I'll go take a look.

20
00:06:14,618 --> 00:06:16,618
Who are you?

21
00:06:19,578 --> 00:06:23,078
Fourth Mistress, please come in.

22
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:26,311
So the Fourth Mistress is you!

23
00:06:34,713 --> 00:06:37,713
Yes. I'm the Fourth Mistress!

24
00:06:44,252 --> 00:06:46,752
Bring my suitcase inside.

25
00:06:57,888 --> 00:07:00,888
This is where you will live.

26
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:05,888
My name is Chen Baishun, the housekeeper.
I am at your service.

27
00:07:07,606 --> 00:07:11,606
Why are there so many red lanterns?

28
00:07:12,106 --> 00:07:14,606
Because you're coming!

29
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:52,257
Fourth Mistress, this is part of
our family custom.

30
00:08:52,757 --> 00:08:53,966
I'm here to serve you.

31
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:05,343
You'll get used to it.

32
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:20,876
Fourt Mistress, we're here to do your hair
and help you change.

33
00:11:45,743 --> 00:11:49,243
Master, congratulations on your wedding.

34
00:11:58,836 --> 00:12:02,336
How was the foot massage?

35
00:12:05,313 --> 00:12:07,813
A woman's feet are very important.

36
00:12:08,814 --> 00:12:11,314
When they're comfortable, she is healthier...

37
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:14,314
...and better able to serve her man.

38
00:12:15,331 --> 00:12:17,831
Pick up that lantern.

39
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:23,831
Yes, that one.

40
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,490
Higher...

41
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,419
Look up.

42
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:02,401
Educated girls are different.

43
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,871
Now, undress and get in bed.

44
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:03,871
Put out the lights.

45
00:14:04,371 --> 00:14:09,371
What? I have all these lanterns so I can see.

46
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:13,381
I like it bright and formal.

47
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,917
Who's there?

48
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,544
Third Mistress is sick.
She wants you to come.

49
00:14:48,044 --> 00:14:50,416
I'm in bed.

50
00:14:50,544 --> 00:14:54,044
It's an emergency.
She said you must come.

51
00:14:54,063 --> 00:14:56,563
It can wait till tomorrow.

52
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:00,563
If something serious happens to her,
we'll be blamed.

53
00:15:01,063 --> 00:15:03,563
Damn it! What is she up to?

54
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:13,336
I'll have to go see.
Or she won't let me sleep tonight.

55
00:15:16,861 --> 00:15:19,471
The Master is leaving?
Going to the third house?

56
00:15:19,608 --> 00:15:20,743
Yes!

57
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:24,769
Light the lanterns at the third house!

58
00:17:02,123 --> 00:17:04,448
Fourth Mistress...

59
00:17:07,123 --> 00:17:09,044
Fourth Mistress...

60
00:17:11,557 --> 00:17:17,694
According to our custom,
you should visit the other three mistress.

61
00:17:17,776 --> 00:17:21,010
Take your breakfast later.

62
00:17:39,361 --> 00:17:43,371
It's our custom t o have all
meetings and meals here.

63
00:17:44,372 --> 00:17:47,872
The Chen family's customs
go back many generations.

64
00:17:48,372 --> 00:17:51,872
It is important that you obey them.

65
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:20,872
Kowtow to our ancestors.

66
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:32,872
First, go to greet the master
at the Third Mistress' house.

67
00:18:41,948 --> 00:18:47,470
It seems they're still asleep.
We'll come back.

68
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:09,850
First Mistress,
the Fourth Mistress is here to visit.

69
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:11,850
Big sister.

70
00:19:16,152 --> 00:19:17,850
How old are you?

71
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,850
Nineteen.

72
00:19:21,718 --> 00:19:24,350
I heard you went to university.

73
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,350
For six months.

74
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:35,850
It's good you're educated.

75
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,745
You'll get used to living here.

76
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:49,350
Get on well with your sisters.
Serve the Master well.

77
00:19:52,884 --> 00:19:55,350
You can go now.

78
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,836
Such sins. Such sins...

79
00:20:12,505 --> 00:20:16,476
What is she, about 100 years old?
Ancient!

80
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:28,561
Second Mistress,
the fourth Mistress has come to visit.

81
00:20:32,537 --> 00:20:35,537
Fourth sister is here. Come in!

82
00:20:35,782 --> 00:20:36,537
Second sister.

83
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:38,782
Do come in.

84
00:20:44,092 --> 00:20:47,092
What a pretty face!
What is your name?

85
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:49,092
Songlian.

86
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:51,271
A pretty name, too.

87
00:20:52,092 --> 00:20:55,592
I'm Zhuoyun. Just call me by my name.

88
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:59,112
You look like a student.

89
00:20:59,113 --> 00:21:01,612
I was at university for six months.

90
00:21:02,092 --> 00:21:04,612
Why did you leave?

91
00:21:04,613 --> 00:21:08,592
My father died.
The family couldn't afford it.

92
00:21:10,092 --> 00:21:12,112
How old was your father?

93
00:21:12,113 --> 00:21:14,112
Fifty three.

94
00:21:14,113 --> 00:21:16,612
So young!

95
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,592
Life is so unpredictable!

96
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,150
Tea, Fourth Mistress.

97
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,150
Where are you from?

98
00:21:30,151 --> 00:21:32,150
Fengcheng.

99
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:34,650
They grow tea there.

100
00:21:34,717 --> 00:21:37,810
My father was in the tea business.

101
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,151
His shop closed down.

102
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:46,652
Your mother let you marry
someone from so far away?

103
00:21:49,076 --> 00:21:51,480
She's my stepmother.

104
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,455
I see.

105
00:21:57,521 --> 00:22:01,832
So, how was the foot massage last night?

106
00:22:02,773 --> 00:22:05,644
Is it like that every night?

107
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:11,357
Silly. You can't have it whenever you wish.

108
00:22:11,387 --> 00:22:13,529
Where the master spends the night...

109
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,715
...that mistress gets o foot massage
and lighted lanterns.

110
00:22:17,114 --> 00:22:21,029
With a new wife as young and pretty, as you...

111
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:26,113
...I'm afraid I won't be enjoying
these privileges for some time.

112
00:22:29,075 --> 00:22:31,753
But don't underestimate
the importance of this custom.

113
00:22:31,754 --> 00:22:34,253
If you can manage to have
a foot massage everyday...

114
00:22:34,254 --> 00:22:38,414
...you'll soon be running this household.

115
00:22:41,113 --> 00:22:45,113
Yizhen, come meet your Fourth Aunt.

116
00:22:45,613 --> 00:22:47,613
Fourth Aunt!

117
00:22:47,614 --> 00:22:51,228
How useless! I only have a daughter.

118
00:22:51,229 --> 00:22:55,728
It's getting late.
We must visit the Third Mistress.

119
00:22:56,339 --> 00:22:58,339
Sorry. I just keep talking.

120
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,839
Of course you must meet the Third Mistress.

121
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,339
She was a famous opera singer.

122
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,839
She sings well and is pretty too.

123
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:10,339
But she can be so difficult.

124
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:15,339
Asking for the Master on your wedding night!

125
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,839
So impolite to you!

126
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,874
Wasn't she sick?

127
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:24,374
Sick? She's just spoiled!

128
00:23:52,316 --> 00:23:53,816
Has the Master left?

129
00:23:53,817 --> 00:23:57,316
Just now. They're putting out the lanterns.

130
00:23:57,317 --> 00:24:00,121
Let's meet the Third Mistress.

131
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,870
Third Mistress says she isn't feeling well...

132
00:24:03,871 --> 00:24:07,370
...and says she'll meet you another day.

133
00:24:14,102 --> 00:24:20,137
Third Mistress' son, Feilan.
Same age as Miss Yizhen.

134
00:24:20,138 --> 00:24:22,637
Come meet your Fourth Aunt.

135
00:24:22,638 --> 00:24:24,137
Fourth Aunt!

136
00:24:29,848 --> 00:24:31,848
Four Mistress...

137
00:24:35,848 --> 00:24:37,848
...this is Yan'er.

138
00:24:38,348 --> 00:24:44,348
Master says she'll be your maid.

139
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,848
Yan'er, come greet the Fourth Mistress.

140
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:49,848
Fourth Mistress.

141
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:53,848
I've seen her before.
Bad tempered, isn't she?

142
00:24:53,849 --> 00:24:56,349
No, she's a good girl.
Quick and hardworking too.

143
00:24:56,384 --> 00:24:58,849
Been here for several years.

144
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,849
No lice in her hair, are there?
I hate lice.

145
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:08,349
Let the Fourth Mistress take a look.

146
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:17,849
Kneel down. Let's look at your hair.

147
00:25:22,866 --> 00:25:26,349
What is that smell! Go wash your hair!

148
00:25:29,293 --> 00:25:31,793
Didn't you hear?

149
00:25:31,794 --> 00:25:33,793
I only washed it yesterday.

150
00:25:33,794 --> 00:25:38,020
And wash the clothes I just took off
while you're at it.

151
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:39,520
Go, quickly!

152
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:44,020
Or the Fourth Mistress will be angry. Go!

153
00:25:48,654 --> 00:25:50,154
Yan'er!

154
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:53,175
Yan'er!

155
00:25:55,897 --> 00:25:58,397
Why haven't you washed your hair?

156
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:03,897
The Master favours you and you thought
he'd choose you as a wife.

157
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:10,397
You as our Fourth Mistress?
You were born to be a servant.

158
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,500
Serve the Fourth Mistress well!
Don't waste your time dreaming!

159
00:26:19,097 --> 00:26:22,097
And don't forget to wash your hair!

160
00:26:34,582 --> 00:26:39,082
Where is Meishan?

161
00:26:39,582 --> 00:26:42,082
The Third Mistress is coming.

162
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:46,525
Doctor Gao is writing her a prescription.

163
00:26:53,385 --> 00:26:55,385
Here comes third sister.

164
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:59,708
Third sister, this is our fourth sister.

165
00:26:59,983 --> 00:27:01,983
You haven't met, have you?

166
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,340
Third sister!

167
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,866
Songlian is new here.
Take good care of her.

168
00:27:17,867 --> 00:27:21,966
From now on, you sisters must get
on well with each other.

169
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:23,254
Let's eat.

170
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:37,209
Why aren't you eating?

171
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,709
I don't like meat.

172
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,561
What vegetable dishes do we have today?

173
00:27:42,562 --> 00:27:45,651
Master, today we have...

174
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:50,651
...fragrant mushrooms,
chrysan themum moss hair, bird's nest...

175
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:54,651
...thrice-fried mushrooms,
five-color vegetables...

176
00:27:54,652 --> 00:27:59,651
...vegetarian hot-pot and also heart of cactus.

177
00:28:03,568 --> 00:28:05,068
According to custom...

178
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:07,568
...the one with lighted lanterns
can have whatever she likes.

179
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:10,568
What would you like?

180
00:28:12,068 --> 00:28:14,068
I want spinach and beancurd.

181
00:28:15,313 --> 00:28:18,813
Bring some spinach and beancurd.

182
00:28:18,814 --> 00:28:21,698
Also some young been sprouts.

183
00:28:23,698 --> 00:28:26,198
Fourth Mistress...

184
00:28:30,198 --> 00:28:36,198
Master asks you to wait at the door for instructions.

185
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:39,715
What instructions?

186
00:28:39,716 --> 00:28:42,444
Please wait outside.

187
00:28:42,445 --> 00:28:45,731
The Master may have instructions before he retires.

188
00:28:45,732 --> 00:28:50,231
But why do we have to wait outside?

189
00:28:50,232 --> 00:28:55,731
It's another old family custom.
All the other mistresses ago.

190
00:29:07,241 --> 00:29:09,241
But I wasn't called before.

191
00:29:09,242 --> 00:29:12,241
Not for nine days after the wedding.

192
00:29:12,242 --> 00:29:15,741
This is your 10th day.

193
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:23,452
Light the lanterns at the fourth house!

194
00:31:12,986 --> 00:31:13,986
Well?

195
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:19,486
Lighted lanterns, foot massages.
Dou you like it here?

196
00:31:21,483 --> 00:31:25,483
After a few days, you won't want to leave.

197
00:31:28,808 --> 00:31:31,308
Who is it?

198
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:34,308
Third Mistress says she's sick again.

199
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,808
She wants the master to come over.

200
00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:40,808
Third sister is asking for you again.
You must go.

201
00:31:41,808 --> 00:31:45,308
Meishan is so impossible!

202
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:48,808
Go, don't come to me again.

203
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:52,655
You don't mean that.

204
00:31:52,656 --> 00:31:57,155
Tell the Third Mistress
I won't see her tonight!

205
00:31:57,156 --> 00:31:59,327
What am I to hell her?

206
00:31:59,328 --> 00:32:01,827
Nonsense! What do you mean?

207
00:32:01,828 --> 00:32:04,827
Tell her I'll see her tomorrow!

208
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,500
- Who's singing? Third sister?
- Yes.

209
00:32:22,618 --> 00:32:28,618
She was sick last night but
she's singing at this hour.

210
00:32:29,061 --> 00:32:34,061
She won't let us sleep.

211
00:32:34,062 --> 00:32:39,561
She sings when she's happy,
cries when she's mad.

212
00:32:39,562 --> 00:32:43,886
That bitch! Never mind her!

213
00:35:31,565 --> 00:35:37,065
Third sister, have you recovered?

214
00:35:38,693 --> 00:35:42,193
Did I wake you from your sweet dreams?

215
00:35:42,194 --> 00:35:45,693
Yes, you did.

216
00:35:45,694 --> 00:35:50,717
Good, or you'll sleep till you're silly.

217
00:35:52,157 --> 00:35:58,157
Silly, hardly!
I came up to hear third sister sing.

218
00:35:58,254 --> 00:35:59,754
Do continue.

219
00:36:00,156 --> 00:36:02,156
You want to listen...

220
00:36:02,157 --> 00:36:05,156
...but I don't feel like singing anymore.

221
00:36:39,768 --> 00:36:42,768
You went to hear Meishan sing?

222
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:51,006
I've spoiled her.

223
00:36:51,141 --> 00:36:55,141
When she's angry, she even curses my ancestors.

224
00:36:55,142 --> 00:36:57,141
Bitch!

225
00:36:57,142 --> 00:36:59,641
I must teach her a lesson.

226
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:12,194
What? Angry?

227
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:19,370
Don't be childish.

228
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:24,505
I'll take you to Wumei Lane today to eat dumplings.

229
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:28,070
Didn't you say you liked the dumplings there?

230
00:37:34,404 --> 00:37:36,904
You really don't want me to stay?

231
00:37:37,224 --> 00:37:42,224
There are others desperate for a foot massage,
you know.

232
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:50,858
The Master has left! Blow out the lanterns!

233
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:15,590
Light the lanterns at the third house!

234
00:38:39,779 --> 00:38:41,279
Yan'er!

235
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:47,564
Yan'er! Yan'er!

236
00:38:47,565 --> 00:38:49,495
Coming!

237
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,680
Can't you walk faster?

238
00:39:27,853 --> 00:39:30,353
Go away if you don't like working for me.

239
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,920
Don't think because the master touched you.
You can behave this way.

240
00:39:35,933 --> 00:39:39,933
Always pulling a long face?

241
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,179
No, I wouldn't dare.

242
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,510
But any face is better than having none!

243
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:58,394
Why did you come to me?

244
00:39:58,395 --> 00:40:01,894
Tired of your new wife already?

245
00:40:02,544 --> 00:40:05,544
What's so good about my place?

246
00:40:05,545 --> 00:40:10,776
She's mad at me. Of course it's good here.

247
00:40:10,777 --> 00:40:14,776
You are gentle and you'll sing for me.

248
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:28,239
Well done!

249
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:53,426
The more you sing, the better it gets. Again!

250
00:41:52,515 --> 00:41:57,515
Fourth sister, come down here!

251
00:41:58,126 --> 00:42:02,626
I've something to say to you.

252
00:42:02,627 --> 00:42:04,215
Second sister.

253
00:42:05,517 --> 00:42:08,517
You don't look well.

254
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,827
No more lighted lanterns and foot massages...

255
00:42:11,828 --> 00:42:14,327
...are you unhappy?

256
00:42:15,548 --> 00:42:19,548
I don't care. I like being alone.

257
00:42:21,493 --> 00:42:24,993
You don't want to be alone in this family.

258
00:42:24,994 --> 00:42:29,532
No foot massages for a few days and the servants
don't treat you the same way.

259
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:32,532
The master can come and go as he pleases.

260
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:37,032
Doesn't he find these customs troublesome?

261
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:42,235
Lighting lanterns is an old family custom.

262
00:42:42,777 --> 00:42:45,777
It was like this when I arrived.

263
00:42:45,778 --> 00:42:50,277
This is silk from Suzhou.
Have some dresses made with it.

264
00:42:50,278 --> 00:42:53,777
I'm embarrassed.

265
00:42:54,588 --> 00:42:56,088
I should be giving you gifts.

266
00:42:56,089 --> 00:42:58,088
Why?

267
00:42:58,556 --> 00:43:03,056
I thought of this silk when I first saw you.

268
00:43:04,973 --> 00:43:09,473
I wouldn't give it to that singer even
if she paid for it.

269
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:14,467
Did you see how self-satisfied she was just now?

270
00:43:16,737 --> 00:43:22,737
What is that small room for up above?
It's locked with a big chain.

271
00:43:23,237 --> 00:43:25,237
That house of death?

272
00:43:25,238 --> 00:43:29,237
Don't go there.
Several people have died there.

273
00:43:29,238 --> 00:43:34,168
What people?

274
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:39,345
Women from past generations.
They hanged there.

275
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:46,292
Don't ask about this.
Nobody here wants to talk about it.

276
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:54,083
Visit me when you have time.
Don't go there again.

277
00:43:57,734 --> 00:44:02,234
The Master's out.
He said you shouldn't wait from him.

278
00:44:06,979 --> 00:44:08,979
Let's eat then.

279
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:23,220
Why is there no spinach and beancurd?

280
00:44:26,419 --> 00:44:30,419
There are too many vegetable dishes already.

281
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:35,135
Go, bring some pork steamed in lotus leaves.

282
00:44:35,136 --> 00:44:36,635
Yes.

283
00:44:49,774 --> 00:44:53,274
Why so many meat dishes today?

284
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:57,104
The third house had lighted lanterns yesterday.

285
00:44:57,105 --> 00:44:59,509
Didn't the master remarry recently?

286
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:02,509
Who knows about these things?

287
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:04,661
It's up to him.

288
00:45:04,662 --> 00:45:07,249
The house with lighted lanterns sets the menu.

289
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,749
We just follow orders.

290
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:26,827
Who is it?

291
00:46:26,828 --> 00:46:28,827
Yan'er.

292
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,100
Why are you sneaking around like that?

293
00:46:32,101 --> 00:46:35,100
Third Mistress asks you over to play majong.

294
00:46:35,101 --> 00:46:39,100
Me, play majong? What an ideal!

295
00:46:40,747 --> 00:46:42,247
I won't go!

296
00:46:44,419 --> 00:46:47,919
Fourth sister...

297
00:46:51,015 --> 00:46:54,015
...whe need one more player. Come!

298
00:46:57,416 --> 00:46:59,916
I don't like majong.

299
00:47:01,725 --> 00:47:05,725
Come on. Don't stay in your house all day.

300
00:47:12,189 --> 00:47:15,189
Still angry about the spinach and beancurd?

301
00:47:15,626 --> 00:47:17,626
I couldn't care less.

302
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:22,570
Good. I knew fourth sister wasn't petty.

303
00:47:23,238 --> 00:47:26,238
Don't like losing your money to me too?

304
00:47:26,682 --> 00:47:30,182
Don't worry. I'll let you win.

305
00:47:33,332 --> 00:47:38,332
Since you put it that way, then I must go.

306
00:47:39,729 --> 00:47:41,229
But no need to let me, win.

307
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:44,229
Who knows how the game will end?

308
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,691
Good!

309
00:47:49,814 --> 00:47:51,814
This is Doctor Gao, a regular visitor.

310
00:47:51,815 --> 00:47:53,814
He is our family doctor.

311
00:47:53,815 --> 00:47:58,186
His friend, Mr. Wang. This is our Fourth Mistress.

312
00:47:58,686 --> 00:48:01,686
Please sit down.

313
00:48:01,687 --> 00:48:03,904
Let's start.

314
00:48:04,898 --> 00:48:08,398
Our Fourth Mistress was a university student.

315
00:48:08,399 --> 00:48:12,398
I'm only an opera singer.

316
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:18,219
She plays to win today.
Both of you should be careful.

317
00:48:18,426 --> 00:48:20,426
Come, it's just a game.

318
00:48:24,317 --> 00:48:28,817
Third sister's house is decorated like a stage.

319
00:48:29,317 --> 00:48:32,817
No one can forget their past.

320
00:48:36,604 --> 00:48:41,104
The Master's back.
Why wasn't it announced?

321
00:48:41,105 --> 00:48:42,604
I just came in.

322
00:48:42,605 --> 00:48:44,104
The Master must be tired.

323
00:48:44,105 --> 00:48:45,604
Where is she?

324
00:48:45,605 --> 00:48:48,605
Playing majong with the Third Mistress.
I'll call her.

325
00:48:48,606 --> 00:48:50,605
Never mind.

326
00:48:51,605 --> 00:48:55,105
Why can't she stay in her own house?

327
00:48:55,106 --> 00:48:58,605
Light the lanterns at the second house.

328
00:49:22,116 --> 00:49:28,116
The master's back.
He couldn't find you and went to the second house.

329
00:49:34,665 --> 00:49:38,665
Nevermind. Let's play.

330
00:49:45,372 --> 00:49:49,872
Fourth sister has done Zhuoyun a favour.

331
00:49:50,251 --> 00:49:53,251
She is so lonely.

332
00:49:53,252 --> 00:49:55,608
Lend her the Master for one night.

333
00:49:55,609 --> 00:49:57,608
If you lose money, have her pay you back.

334
00:49:57,609 --> 00:49:59,462
Then you're even.

335
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:10,440
I heard the Fourth Mistress didn't finish university. Why?

336
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:16,099
What's the use? I'm just one of the Master's robes.

337
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,099
He can wear it or he can take it off.

338
00:50:37,218 --> 00:50:42,218
Efendim, I want to give you a son.

339
00:51:20,674 --> 00:51:27,174
Meishan was famous for singing this opera.

340
00:51:31,526 --> 00:51:34,026
That was years ago.

341
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:15,833
AUTUMN

342
00:52:38,007 --> 00:52:41,007
This place must be haunted.

343
00:52:41,008 --> 00:52:44,642
Haunted? Nonsense!

344
00:52:45,491 --> 00:52:47,991
That room on the roof.

345
00:52:47,992 --> 00:52:53,742
Two people hanged there, that's all.

346
00:52:54,411 --> 00:52:56,411
Why?

347
00:52:56,412 --> 00:53:01,911
Need you ask?
They were having illicit affairs.

348
00:53:02,411 --> 00:53:05,411
Who were they?

349
00:53:05,412 --> 00:53:10,411
Nobody you know. Two women from past generations.

350
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:14,858
Concubines?

351
00:53:18,108 --> 00:53:21,108
Don't talk nonsense!

352
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:37,611
What is it now?

353
00:53:37,612 --> 00:53:38,841
She's peeping at us.

354
00:53:38,842 --> 00:53:42,341
- Who?
- Yan'er.

355
00:53:42,342 --> 00:53:47,206
What's there to look at.
She can't see anything anyway.

356
00:53:47,207 --> 00:53:49,384
You're always on her side.

357
00:53:50,183 --> 00:53:54,183
I can smell her miles away.

358
00:54:04,611 --> 00:54:07,111
- Who is it?
- Master.

359
00:54:09,611 --> 00:54:10,611
What is it?

360
00:54:10,612 --> 00:54:16,111
The Fourth Mistress' spinach and beancurd is ready.

361
00:54:16,342 --> 00:54:20,342
The other mistresses are waiting.

362
00:54:20,343 --> 00:54:24,585
I'm not going. Ask them to bring it here.

363
00:54:27,944 --> 00:54:30,444
That's not right.

364
00:54:30,445 --> 00:54:34,124
We should go or they'll talk.

365
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:39,625
Them! What do I care if they talk!

366
00:54:39,995 --> 00:54:43,495
Alright, we'll eat here.

367
00:54:43,598 --> 00:54:47,598
Go, tell them to bring the food here.

368
00:54:54,939 --> 00:54:58,439
The Master asks that you go ahead.
He isn't coming.

369
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,439
The food will be taken to the Fourth Mistress' room.

370
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:12,949
We don't have this custom here.

371
00:55:14,413 --> 00:55:17,913
Is this not the Fourth Mistress' idea?

372
00:55:27,855 --> 00:55:33,855
Third sister, don't be angry.
Let's eat.

373
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:41,642
Big sister, let me make this clear.

374
00:55:43,142 --> 00:55:48,142
If my lanterns are lit.
I want my food brought to me too.

375
00:55:48,143 --> 00:55:52,642
You want to be as foolish?

376
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,642
How does that make our big sister feel?

377
00:55:56,643 --> 00:56:01,703
What do I matter? I'm just an old woman.

378
00:56:01,704 --> 00:56:07,203
One of these days,
this family will perish in your hands.

379
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:18,110
Who is playing the flute?

380
00:56:18,111 --> 00:56:21,110
Our young master.
He came back this morning.

381
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:25,453
Feipu, son of the First Mistress?
I heard he's always away.

382
00:56:25,454 --> 00:56:29,953
He's very busy.
He's going Yunnan in the morning.

383
00:57:25,101 --> 00:57:27,101
Are you Songlian?

384
00:57:31,101 --> 00:57:34,601
You shouldn't call me by my name.

385
00:57:34,602 --> 00:57:38,101
How should I address you?
Fourth Mistress?

386
00:57:44,084 --> 00:57:46,584
Did the music bring you here?

387
00:57:48,322 --> 00:57:51,822
Go on, don't let me stop you.

388
00:57:52,234 --> 00:57:53,734
Can you play too?

389
00:57:56,029 --> 00:57:59,029
Feipu, come down here!

390
00:58:03,127 --> 00:58:07,127
My mother wants me. I must go.

391
00:58:48,436 --> 00:58:51,048
Yan'er!

392
00:58:51,049 --> 00:58:52,548
Yan'er!

393
00:58:52,943 --> 00:58:55,443
Come here.

394
00:58:58,484 --> 00:59:00,984
Did you open my suitcase?

395
00:59:00,985 --> 00:59:05,011
Yes, to tidy up your clothes.

396
00:59:05,286 --> 00:59:07,786
Did you see a flute inside?

397
00:59:07,787 --> 00:59:12,932
Flute? No. Only men play the flute.

398
00:59:16,944 --> 00:59:18,444
You stole it.

399
00:59:18,445 --> 00:59:23,944
Why would I want to steal it?

400
00:59:24,264 --> 00:59:27,264
You're always sneaking about.
Stop pretending.

401
00:59:27,951 --> 00:59:30,451
Don't blame it on me.

402
00:59:30,452 --> 00:59:35,828
Ask the other mistress.
Have I even stolen anything?

403
00:59:42,904 --> 00:59:47,904
Fourth Mistress, I really didn't take your flute!

404
00:59:51,189 --> 00:59:52,689
I didn't!

405
00:59:55,785 --> 00:59:57,785
I didn't take it!

406
00:59:59,723 --> 01:00:03,223
Don't go in! I didn't take your flute!

407
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:08,290
Then what are you afraid of?
I must take a look!

408
01:00:14,767 --> 01:00:19,767
How dare you light lanterns here!

409
01:00:19,768 --> 01:00:22,767
You're only a servant!

410
01:00:22,768 --> 01:00:25,569
Don't you know the rules here?

411
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:27,807
Do you know what could happen to you?

412
01:00:27,808 --> 01:00:32,013
I beg you. Don't tell anyone!

413
01:00:32,481 --> 01:00:35,981
Alright, then give me back my flute.

414
01:00:35,982 --> 01:00:40,481
I really didn't take you flute.

415
01:00:46,224 --> 01:00:47,224
Fourth Mistress...

416
01:01:06,435 --> 01:01:09,935
"Songlian"

417
01:01:14,697 --> 01:01:19,197
You've put a curse on me!

418
01:01:19,659 --> 01:01:23,159
You want me to die!

419
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:12,451
Don't cry.

420
01:02:14,754 --> 01:02:19,254
I shouldn't treat you this way.

421
01:02:19,255 --> 01:02:22,754
I'll forget what you did.

422
01:02:27,256 --> 01:02:33,756
You can't read or write.
