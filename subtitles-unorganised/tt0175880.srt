{418}{461}In the "New York Herald..."
{462}{543}November 26,year--1911...
{544}{621}there is an account|of the hanging of three men.
{713}{798}They died for the murder|of Sir Edmund William Godfrey...
{799}{837}husband,father, pharmacist...
{838}{889}and all-around|gentleman resident...
{890}{980}of Greenberry Hill, London.
{981}{1033}He was murdered|by three vagrants...
{1034}{1087}whose motive was simple robbery.
{1088}{1128}They were identified as...
{1129}{1189}Joseph Green...
{1190}{1240}Stanley Berry...
{1241}{1286}and Daniel Hill.
{1378}{1448}Green, Berry, Hill.
{1485}{1598}And I would like to think this|was only a matter of chance.
{1654}{1709}As reported|in the "Reno Gazette..."
{1710}{1778}June of 1983...
{1779}{1826}there is the story of afire...
{1827}{1880}the water that it took|to contain the fire...
{1915}{2005}and a scuba diver|named Delmer Darion.
{2071}{2176}Employee of the Nugget Hotel|and Casino, Reno, Nevada...
{2177}{2225}engaged as a blackjack dealer.
{2226}{2277}Well-liked and well-regarded...
{2278}{2352}as a physical, recreational,|and sporting sort...
{2353}{2413}Delmer's true passion|was for the lake.
{2672}{2747}As reported by the coroner,|Delmer died of a heart attack...
{2748}{2807}somewhere between|the lake and the tree...
{2807}{2844}but most curious side note...
{2845}{2921}is the suicide the next day|of Craig Hansen...
{2922}{2998}volunteer firefighter,|estranged father of four...
{2999}{3055}and a poor tendency to drink.
{3056}{3133}Mr. Hansen was the pilot of|the plane that accidentally...
{3134}{3199}lifted Delmer Darion|out of the water.
{3200}{3269}Added to this,|Mr. Hansen's tortured life...
{3270}{3356}met before with Delmer Darion|just two nights previous.
{3357}{3391}All l need is a two.
{3392}{3466}All you need is a deuce.|All right.
{3467}{3503}That is an eight.
{3504}{3567}Glad you like my work.|Moment of truth.
{3595}{3630}The weight of the guilt...
{3631}{3697}and the measure|of coincidence so large...
{3698}{3746}Craig Hansen took his life.
{3792}{3839}And l am trying to think...
{3840}{3928}this was all only|a matter of chance.
{3929}{4007}The tale told|at a 1961 awards dinner...
{4008}{4079}for the American Association|of Forensic Science...
{4080}{4161}by Dr. John Harper,|president of the association...
{4162}{4237}began with|a simple suicide attempt.
{4238}{4317}Seventeen-year-old|Sydney Barringer...
{4318}{4445}in the city of Los Angeles|on March 23, 1958.
{4828}{4885}The coroner ruled that|the unsuccessful suicide...
{4886}{4961}had suddenly become|a successful homicide.
{4962}{5046}To explain--the suicide|was confirmed by a note...
{5047}{5123}in the right hip pocket|of Sydney Barringer.
{5124}{5228}At the same time young Sydney|stood on the ledge...
{5229}{5293}an argument swelled|three stories below.
{5293}{5370}The neighbors heard,|as they usually did...
{5371}{5413}the arguing of the tenants...
{5414}{5448}and it was not uncommon|for them...
{5449}{5502}to threaten each other|with a shotgun...
{5503}{5557}or one of the many handguns|kept in the house.
{5558}{5603}I'm going to put you down!
{5604}{5657}And when the shotgun|accidentally went off...
{5658}{5687}You asshole!
{5726}{5773}Sydney just happened to pass.
{5774}{5801}What?
{5802}{5873}Shut the fuck up!
{5874}{5960}Added to this,|the tenants turned out to be...
{5961}{6002}Fay and Arthur Barringer...
{6003}{6077}Sydney's mother and father.
{6078}{6128}When confronted|with the charge...
{6129}{6215}which took some figuring out|for the officers on the scene...
{6216}{6316}Fay Barringer swore she did not|know the gun was loaded.
{6317}{6401}She always threatens me with it,|but l don't keep it loaded.
{6402}{6466}And you didn't load the gun?
{6467}{6502}Why would l load the gun?
{6502}{6555}A young boy|who lived in the building...
{6556}{6626}sometimes a visitor and friend|to Sydney Barringer...
{6627}{6683}said that he had seen,|six days prior...
{6684}{6723}the loading of the shotgun.
{6724}{6762}Ricky, come here a minute.
{6763}{6817}It seems that all|the arguing and fighting...
{6818}{6894}and violence was far too much|for Sydney Barringer...
{6895}{6975}and knowing his mother and|father's tendency to fight...
{6976}{7039}he decided to do something.
{7040}{7108}He said he wanted them|to kill each other...
{7109}{7177}and all they wanted to do|was to kill each other...
{7178}{7255}and he would help them do that|if that's what they wanted.
{7256}{7352}Sydney Barringer jumps|from the ninth floor rooftop.
{7353}{7415}His parents argue|three stories below.
{7416}{7490}Her accidental shotgun blast|hits Sydney in the stomach...
{7491}{7562}as he passes the arguing|sixth floor window.
{7563}{7638}He is killed instantly,|but continues to fall...
{7639}{7697}only to find,|five stories below...
{7698}{7754}a safety net|installed three days prior...
{7755}{7816}for a set of window washers|that would've broken his fall...
{7817}{7899}and saved his life--if not|for the hole in his stomach.
{7900}{7987}So Fay Barringer was charged|with the murder of her son...
{7988}{8110}and Sydney Barringer noted as|an accomplice in his own death.
{8111}{8152}And it is in the humble opinion|of this narrator...
{8153}{8229}that this is not just|"something that happened."
{8230}{8322}This cannot be|"one of those things."
{8323}{8391}This, please, cannot be that.
{8392}{8459}And for what|l would like to say, l can't.
{8460}{8523}This was not just|a matter of chance.
{8573}{8628}These strange things|happen all the time.
{9340}{9407}In this big game|that we play, life...
{9408}{9458}it's not what you hope for|or deserve...
{9459}{9515}it's what you take.

{20446}{20487}No. l said that already.
{20488}{20545}-Are you lying to me?|-l live by myself.
{20546}{20635}That might be true, but|the question I'm asking you...
{20636}{20690}Is there anyone else|in this house right now?
{20762}{20826}-What is your name?|-Marcie.
{20827}{20898}Marcie, I'm going to need you|to take a seat here.

{21483}{21547}-What was that?|-l didn't hear nothing.

{23933}{23988}That ain't mine.
{24013}{24088}He's fucking dying|as we're sitting here.
{24089}{24126}There's not a fucking...
{24127}{24176}Jesus, how can you tell me|to calm down?
{24177}{24245}l can help you through this|the best way l know how...
{24245}{24305}but there's certain things|you have to take care of.

{24344}{24386}but l need to know that|you're listening to me.
{24387}{24447}I'm in a fucking state.
{24448}{24496}It's like he's going,|and l don't know...
{24497}{24572}Just tell me practical things,|like what to do with his body.
{24573}{24652}What do l do when he dies?|What happens then?
{24653}{24697}That's what Hospice|can take care of for you.
{24698}{24745}They'll send over a nurse...
{24746}{24802}No. He has Phil now.
{24803}{24838}Phil's one of the nurses|from the service?
{24868}{24940}IF you're happy with Phil|taking care of him,fine...
{24942}{25009}but contact Hospice|to arrange for the body.
{25010}{25050}You don't understand.
{25051}{25156}There's more pain, and the|fucking pills aren't working.
{25157}{25242}The past two days,|he can't really swallow...
{25243}{25334}and l don't know|if the pills are going down.
{25334}{25370}l can't see inside|his mouth anymore.
{25370}{25421}I'm up all night|staring at him...
{25422}{25459}and l don't know|if the pills are going down.
{25460}{25502}He moans and he hurts.
{25502}{25562}We can fix that,|because l can give you...
{25563}{25610}Are you listening?
{25610}{25661}I'm listening.|I'm getting better.
{25662}{25700}Do you want to sit down?
{25701}{25739}l need to sit down.
{25840}{25898}Linda,|Earl's not going to make it.
{25898}{25982}He's dying. He is.|Very,very rapidly.
{25983}{26076}The thing here is|to make this experience...
{26077}{26158}as painless and easy|for him as possible.
{26159}{26201}You understand?
{26202}{26300}Hospice will take care of|all the technical things.
{26301}{26380}They will help you|and take care of the body.
{26381}{26434}They are who you call|when he dies.
{26465}{26509}There's the number of Hospice.
{26569}{26654}Now, as far as|the morphine pills go...
{26655}{26702}there's something else|to consider.
{26703}{26822}There's a very potent solution|of liquid morphine.
{26823}{26899}And it's a little bottle,|has an eyedropper.
{26900}{26959}Very easy to get into his mouth|and drop on his tongue...
{26959}{27034}and it will certainly diminish|the pain that he's in.
{27081}{27179}But you need to realize|that once you give ti him...
{27180}{27236}there really is no going back.
{27237}{27299}It will|certainly cure his pain...
{27300}{27352}but he will drift|in and out of consciousness...
{27353}{27426}even worse than he is now.
{27427}{27543}All sign of the recognizable|Earl will pretty much go away.
{27611}{27661}What the fuck can l say to that?
{27662}{27705}l don't know|what to say to that.
{27980}{28028}l don't want to do this...
{28068}{28103}Sit here.
{28156}{28229}l can see the thing,you know.
{28230}{28302}It's getting there,|that's the cock sucker.
{28353}{28412}l see that pen.
{28413}{28464}l see it.|l know it's there.
{28465}{28502}l reach for it.
{28617}{28668}No, no goddamn use.
{28718}{28765}l have a son,you know.
{28766}{28840}You do? Where is he?
{28841}{28880}l don't know.
{28881}{28944}l mean...
{28945}{28981}he's around.
{29010}{29125}He's here in town,|but l don't know.
{29125}{29181}You know...
{29181}{29229}He's a tough one.
{29261}{29297}Very.
{29409}{29441}Got a girlfriend, Phil?
{29470}{29540}-Get a girlfriend.|-I'm trying.
{29541}{29619}Do good things with her.|Share the things.
{29620}{29686}All that bullshit is true.
{29687}{29777}Find a good one,|hold on, and all that.
{29778}{29818}Where's Linda?
{29819}{29874}She went out|to run some errands.
{29875}{29911}She'll be back.
{29912}{29992}She's a good girl.
{30023}{30131}She's a little nuts,|but she's a good girl, l think.
{30181}{30234}She's a little daffy.
{30235}{30285}She loves you.
{30286}{30355}Well, maybe.
{30356}{30455}Yeah. She's a good one.
{30456}{30545}When's the last time|you talked to your son?
{30546}{30616}l don't know.
{30617}{30677}Ten.
{30678}{30764}Maybe ten...five.
{30839}{30956}Fuck. Fuck.
{30957}{31016}It's another thing that goes.
{31017}{31051}Your memory?
{31051}{31128}Time lines,you know?
{31129}{31271}l can remember things,|but not right there.
{31272}{31370}You know?|The fuck you know.
{31371}{31419}I've seen it before.
{31420}{31455}Other fucking assholes like me?
{31455}{31550}-There's no asshole like you.|-Cock sucker.
{31551}{31595}How come every word you use...
{31595}{31649}is "cock sucker.,"|"shit-balls," or "fuck"?
{31650}{31729}-Do me a personal favor.|-Go fuck myself.
{31730}{31809}You got it. God.
{31970}{32023}l can't...
{32024}{32069}l can't hold on to this|any longer.
{32070}{32122}Want another morphine pill?
{32123}{32173}No.|Give me the fucking phone.
{32174}{32210}Who you gonna call?
{32211}{32308}l want to see this.|Where is he?
{32309}{32356}-Who?|-Jack.
{32357}{32445}Is Jack your son?
{32446}{32519}Do you want to call him|on the phone?
{32520}{32590}l can dial the number|if you can remember it.
{32591}{32625}It's not him.
{32626}{32714}It's not him.|He's a fucking asshole.
{32715}{32799}Phil, come here.|This is so boring.
{32800}{32876}So goddamn...
{32877}{32945}That dying wish...
{32946}{33062}and all that|old-man-on-a-bed...
{33063}{33152}wants one thing...
{33153}{33221}Find him on a...
{33304}{33387}Frank.
{33389}{33508}His name's Frank Mackey.
{33557}{33662}Frank Mackey?|That's your son?
{33663}{33700}Not my name.
{33776}{33836}Go find...
{33837}{33876}Find Lily.
{33920}{33996}Give me that. Give me.
{34054}{34141}Give me--|IF you give me that...
{34142}{34266}over there on...
{34267}{34328}Fuck. l can't hold on to this.
{34329}{34375}l got it.
{36862}{36937}Respect the cock.
{36986}{37072}And tame the cunt!
{37145}{37187}Tame it!
{37188}{37224}Take it on headfirst|with the skills...
{37224}{37344}that l will teach you at work|and say no!
{37345}{37404}You will not control me!|No!
{37404}{37477}You will not take my soul!|No!
{37478}{37542}You will not win this game!
{37543}{37620}Because it's a game, guys.|You want to think it's not?
{37620}{37669}Go back to the school yard...
{37670}{37778}and you have that crush|on big-titted Mary Jane.
{37873}{37940}Respect the cock.
{38062}{38134}You are embedding this thought.
{38135}{38194}l am the one who's in charge.
{38230}{38308}l am the one who says yes!
{38309}{38344}No!
{38345}{38404}Now!
{38405}{38435}Here!
{38608}{38660}Because it's universal, man.
{38661}{38728}It is evolutional.|It is anthropological.
{38729}{38841}It is biological.|It is animal.
{38842}{38925}We...
{38926}{38962}are...
{39066}{39104}men!
{39270}{39306}You Gwenovier?
{39306}{39349}I'm Captain Muffy,|Frank's personal assistant.
{39350}{39418}This is Doc.|We can go in right down here.
{39419}{39469}He started|about thirty-five minutes ago...
{39470}{39526}but he's probably getting|all pumped up right now.
{39527}{39590}Look down|at the top of the page.
{39591}{39636}What does it say?
{39637}{39677}Get a calendar!
{39678}{39746}That's right.|l cannot stress this enough.
{39746}{39826}It's a simple item.|It's 99 cents at the store.
{39827}{39914}But if you look into your packs,|reach deep...
{39915}{40027}you'll see l have been|nice enough to include one.
{40028}{40120}That's just|the kind of prick l am.
{40121}{40212}You need this calendar.|It doesn't seem like much.
{40213}{40249}It's a simple, small item...
{40250}{40339}but it is going to make all|the difference in your world.
{40340}{40388}You meet a girl,|you work an A-3 interruption.
{40389}{40475}Say, an eight-day waiting period|before next contact.
{40476}{40534}How are you going to know|when those eight days are up?
{40535}{40612}That's right.|You mark that calendar.
{40613}{40698}You're going to stick with me|and this calendar...
{40699}{40735}and you're going to set goals.
{40736}{40811}IF you really want to make|that friend something else...
{40812}{40871}you have to be tough|on yourself.
{40871}{40943}You have to set goals.
{40943}{41001}You, sir,|in the brown short-sleeve shirt.
{41002}{41059}l can't read your name tag.|What's your name?
{41259}{41324}Hi, is Frank there?
{41325}{41376}No,you have the wrong number.
{41377}{41453}I'm sorry.|I'm looking for a Frank Mackey.
{41454}{41515}There's no Frank here.
{41516}{41639}Is this 818-775-3993?
{41640}{41705}Yeah, but you have|the wrong number.
{41706}{41802}Do you know a Jack,|by any chance?
{41832}{41888}Just a regular deal.|Loosers and tighters.
{41889}{41946}-We're all set upstairs.|-Thanks.
{41947}{42094}She called me up and asked me|for advice about a guy.
{42095}{42149}-Got everything you need?|-All set.
{42150}{42221}Does she know|how you feel about her?
{42222}{42259}Yes. Absolutely.
{42260}{42315}And what did she say?
{42316}{42397}She says she doesn't|feel that way about me.
{42398}{42451}l don't think there's|anyone in this room...
{42452}{42512}who doesn't understand|that kind of pain, Geoff...
{42513}{42566}and l want to thankyou|for sharing that.
{42567}{42615}Let me tell you what|we're going to teach Denise...
{42616}{42722}when we put our calendars|to work and set goals.
{42723}{42779}What l say is, "Denise..."
{42780}{42831}"Denise the Piece."
{42832}{42913}l mark it down.|l write it up.
{42914}{42964}And you have been warned.
{42965}{43044}Because l have my lasers...
{43045}{43108}l have my tasers,|l have my lCBMs...
{43109}{43228}l have my bazookas,|my jets pointed right at you.
{43229}{43299}Because me and my brothers,|we like to celebrate.
{43300}{43408}And on the first of May,|we celebrate V-Day.
{43483}{43607}And come June, baby,|it is the lick of my spoon.
{43631}{43697}Come August,|we like to celebrate...
{43698}{43805}Saint Suck My Big Fat|Fucking Sausage!
{43805}{43858}l set goals for myself...
{43859}{43914}and when l say l do not|want to take it anymore...
{43915}{43955}l will not take it anymore.
{43956}{44032}You think|she's your friend, Geoff?
{44033}{44065}They're not your friends.
{44066}{44167}Do you really think she'll|be there when things go bad?
{44168}{44241}When things go wrong,|think they'll be therefor us?
{44242}{44277}You think again.
{44278}{44365}Fucking Denise,|Denise the Piece...
{44366}{44457}you're gonna give me that|cherry pie, sweet mama baby.
{44564}{44618}Yeah, but listen up,|that is not to say...
{44619}{44676}that we don't all need|females just as friends...
{44677}{44720}because we'll learn later|in Chapter Twenty-three...
{44721}{44767}having a couple|of chick friends...
{44768}{44816}comes in real handy|in setting jealousy traps.
{44817}{44860}We'll get to that later.
{44861}{44962}Right now, pull out|your blue booklets, page 18.
{44963}{45036}We're going quickly,|but we'll workshop it later.
{45037}{45071}Eighteen, blue booklet.
{45142}{45217}This is simple and clean,|and if done correctly...
{45218}{45262}can be very effective|in getting some bush.
{45263}{45299}Here we go.
{45299}{45342}Call your so-called friend|and set a date.
{45343}{45427}Make it around 7:30.|Call her on the phone.
{46038}{46104}Hi. Is Claudia here?

{48085}{48162}Why are you here?|Why are you doing this?
{48163}{48209}You want to call me a whore?
{48210}{48282}l don't want you to think|I'm that way to you.
{48283}{48334}l won't call you a slut.
{48335}{48442}Yeah, right.|What are you doing here?

{49354}{49423}I'm not lying to you.|This is the truth.
{49424}{49482}I'm telling you, Claudia,|I'm going to lose.

{83251}{83305}What?
{83306}{83345}Did you hear what l just said?
{83346}{83409}Yes, but l don't know what...
{83410}{83486}You're listening|to your music so loud...
{83487}{83546}you're going to damage|your ears.
{83602}{83666}You continue to listen|to your music at that level...
{83667}{83731}then you're going to damage|not only your ears...
{83732}{83785}but your neighbors' ears|as well.
{83786}{83830}l didn't realize|it was that loud.
{83831}{83955}That right there is the first|sign of hearing loss.
{84019}{84087}l see you got|your TV on there,too.
{84088}{84150}You usually keep that on|at the same time?
{84151}{84238}l don't know.|What is this?
{84268}{84321}You been doing|some drugs today, Claudia?
{84383}{84432}Have you been doing|some drinking?
{84551}{84640}l got a call|of a disturbance here.
{84641}{84738}Some loud music--"A"...
{84739}{84781}Some screaming and yelling.
{84782}{84837}Has there been some|screaming and yelling here?
{84955}{85030}l had someone come to my door.
{85031}{85091}Someone that l didn't|want to hear.
{85092}{85245}And l told them to leave,|so it's no big deal.
{85246}{85328}They left. I'm sorry.
{85329}{85363}Was that your boyfriend?
{85409}{85466}You don't have a boyfriend?
{85555}{85595}Well,who was it?
{85596}{85678}l was--He's gone.
{85679}{85755}l mean, it's not--|It's over,you know?
{85901}{85983}Mind if l have a look around|for your safety?
{85984}{86024}It's fine.
{86056}{86122}What are you looking for?
{86123}{86223}Claudia,why don't you let me|handle the questions...
{86224}{86301}and you handle the answers?
{86302}{86338}I'm here to help you.
{86388}{86441}Do you still|have to do homework?
{86442}{86477}Not as much as l used to.
{86478}{86537}Since we started,|l haven't gone to school much.
{86538}{86573}I've had so many auditions.
{86574}{86609}l don't have|regular classes anymore.
{86610}{86641}What do you do?
{86642}{86694}They let me have|my own study time...
{86695}{86739}my own reading time|in the library.
{86740}{86768}That's pretty cool.
{86769}{86825}Do you have an agent, Stanley?
{86826}{86861}You should get one.|I'm serious.
{86862}{86905}You could get a lot|of stuff out of this.
{86906}{86937}Like what?
{86938}{86997}Like endorsements and shit!
{86998}{87057}Bite it, Cynthia.|You can get free stuff...
{87057}{87107}from people who want you|to endorse their product.
{87108}{87171}Commercials, a sitcom,|an M.O.W. or something.
{87172}{87200}What's M.O.W.?
{87201}{87243}Hello! Movie of the week.
{87244}{87305}l went for one this morning|with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim.
{87306}{87341}Was it a callback?
{87342}{87390}No. But I'll probably|get a callback.
{87390}{87450}IF we beat the record,|you might get a callback.
{87450}{87498}I'll get it because|I'm a good actress, Richard.
{87498}{87569}-Saucy, saucy!|-Guys, settle down.
{87570}{87617}-Cynthia?|-What?
{87618}{87690}-l gotta go to the bathroom.|-Can you hold it?
{87691}{87751}Yes siree!
{87752}{87844}That was absolutely fantastic,|and l thank you very much.
{87845}{87880}As a matter of fact...
{87881}{87928}we may take you folks|on the road with us...
{87929}{87964}That's my thing.
{87965}{88010}I'm serious.|Milk and sports, man.
{88010}{88071}You never heard milk and sports?
{88072}{88140}Anything baseball|or dealing with numbers...
{88141}{88228}when it comes to those|or who broke whatever record.
{88229}{88311}Any kind of dairy product|or dairy recipe.
{88312}{88387}Like goat milk, goat cheese,|all that stuff.
{88388}{88432}Check this out over here.
{88433}{88502}So, guys,|just work with me on that.
{88503}{88569}Excuse me, can you bring me|low fat milk, please?
{88570}{88613}A couple of ice cubes.
{88614}{88660}They don't look so tough.
{88661}{88716}Do they look smart?
{88717}{88765}What are they going to do,|beat us?
{88767}{88796}Maybe.
{88797}{88888}We're not going out two days|before we set the record.
{88889}{88982}They want us done,they'll call|in the Harvard SWAT team.
{89010}{89045}Ready to run.
{89395}{89467}-You smell like trouble.|-l'm fucking hammered.
{89468}{89506}You OK?
{89507}{89563}Good. You have a chance|to look those over?
{89563}{89634}It's the same fucking shit|for thirty years, Burt.
{89704}{89771}You look like you have money|in your pocket.
{89824}{89917}Maybe I'm just happy to see|my friend Brad there.
{89918}{89995}Just throw some money around.
{89996}{90046}Money, money, money.
{90080}{90139}This sounds threatening.
{90140}{90196}Do you have love in your heart?
{90197}{90246}l have love all over.
{90247}{90310}l even have love for you,|friend.
{90311}{90371}Is it real love?
{90372}{90411}The kind of love|that makes you feel...
{90412}{90519}that intangible joy|in the pit of your stomach...
{90520}{90592}like a bucket of acid and nerves|running around...
{90593}{90674}making you hurt|and happy and all over...
{90675}{90737}You're head over heels?
{90738}{90841}You lost me with the last|couple of cocktail words...
{90842}{90906}but l believe|it's that sort of love.
{90907}{90954}Sounds nice to me.
{91022}{91056}l have love.
{91057}{91107}A very chatty kind.|indeed you do.
{91108}{91177}No, l mean I'm telling you.
{91178}{91225}l have love.
{91226}{91316}Yes, and I'm listening|avidly,fellow.
{91414}{91499}My name is Donnie Smith,|and l have lots of love to give.
{91970}{92017}Lots of stuff here, huh?
{92681}{92748}It's thirty seconds.
{92749}{92791}Got my eye on you.|I'll be back.
{92977}{93024}What the fuck's|going on over there?
{93025}{93068}l gotta go to the bathroom.
{93069}{93104}Jesus Christ, Stanley!
{93105}{93160}No,you cannot do that.
{93161}{93208}Let me explain something|to you people.
{93209}{93264}You have to tone it.|Don't be real aggressive.
{93265}{93348}You have to be subtly abusive|so they don't know it.
{93349}{93417}"No,you're not going outside|and play with your friends...
{93418}{93480}"until that entire room|is cleaned floor to ceiling."
{93481}{93524}Julia's room's the same way.
{93525}{93594}Like a pigsty.|But it's outfits now.
{93595}{93694}You should have seen what she|had on walking out the door!
{93695}{93767}l said, "We're going to school,|not a fashion show."
{93767}{93864}It's not a fashion show.|It's school,for goodness sake!
{93865}{93936}Let's make some fucking|money here, people.
{93937}{93977}You with me,Jimmy?
{93978}{94048}The book says, "We may be|through with the past...
{94049}{94095}"but the past|ain't through with us."
{94095}{94182}"We met upon the level, and|we're parting on the square."
{94183}{94224}In my fucking sleep, Burt.
{94272}{94383}And five,four,three,two...
{94430}{94495}Live,|from Burbank, California...
{94495}{94544}it's "What Do Kids Know?"
{94545}{94591}Going into our|thirty-third year on the air...
{94592}{94642}it's America's|longest-running quiz show...
{94644}{94715}and the place where three kids|get to challenge three adults...
{94716}{94784}and in the end,|we'll see who's the boss.
{94785}{94855}Moving towards their eighth|consecutive week as champions...
{94856}{94938}we have the kids--|Richard,Julia, and Stanley!
{94940}{95052}And our new adult challengers|are Mim, Luis, and Todd.
{95053}{95117}And me, I'm Dick Jennings...

{95211}{95294}Jimmy Gator!
{95436}{95497}Back again, again, again!
{95498}{95541}I'm Jimmy Gator,|and believe it or not...
{95542}{95621}we are at the end of week seven,|heading towards week eight...
{95622}{95719}with these three incredible kids|who--hello, hello...
{95720}{95769}are just two days|and two games away...
{95770}{95818}from the|"What Do Kids Know?" record...
{95819}{95901}for the longest-running|quiz show in television history.
{95902}{95961}Now,we are|endorsed by the PTA...
{95962}{96021}and the North American|Teacher's Foundation.
{96021}{96081}We do try to keep|our standards high...
{96082}{96129}and that's why we are|the longest-running quiz show...
{96130}{96161}in television history!
{96162}{96209}l want to say something|about these kids.
{96210}{96273}These kids right here,|they'll be here a while.
{96274}{96345}But today's|a dangerous day because...
{96346}{96412}l have just met with the adult|challengers backstage...
{96413}{96464}and let me tell you...
{96465}{96518}they are a terrific challenge|for our kids.
{96519}{96588}So let's get this show|up and away, shall we?
{96693}{96754}We want to know|where your son is, Marcie.
{96755}{96788}Jerome Samuel Hall.
{96789}{96836}Did he fight with your husband?|Is this the Worm?
{96837}{96893}Maybe they had a fight.|Maybe it was an accident.
{96893}{96924}Do they call him Worm?
{96925}{96985}We want to know|where your son is, Marcie.
{96986}{97025}Do they call him Worm?
{97026}{97073}Help us help your son,|Marcie.
{97074}{97104}Do they call him Worm?
{97105}{97148}Help us help your son,|Marcie.

{97197}{97244}Is this the Worm?
{97289}{97324}Let's jump right in.
{97325}{97377}A quick recap|for those who don't know.
{97378}{97460}Round One. Three categories.|Steals are OK.
{97461}{97524}Point scale escalating|from 25 to 250...
{97525}{97583}one of which|is a conversation bonus.

{97823}{97870}The categories are...
{97871}{97926}"Authors,|Chaos versus Super string...
{97927}{97965}"and Rub-a-Dub."

{98107}{98154}Adults won a coin toss|backstage...
{98155}{98198}so they get to pick first.
{98199}{98246}Team captain...Mim.
{98547}{98584}Got it.
{98585}{98631}First question for twenty-five.
{98631}{98714}This female author's most famous|work--"O Pioneers!"
{98823}{98850}Willa Cather.
{98851}{98887}Willa Cather for twenty-five.
{98887}{98986}Best known for the Tragedy and|Blood genre,this playwright...
{98987}{99055}Thomas Kyd.
{99056}{99144}This French playwright and actor|joined the Bejart troupe...
{99145}{99190}Moliere.
{99191}{99259}I'm afraid I'm going|to need a full name, Stanley.
{99259}{99309}Jean-Batiste Poquelin Moliere.
{99345}{99389}What the fuck is this?
{99390}{99437}God damn.|My little fucker.
{99438}{99497}l have no idea|where he gets this shit.
{99498}{99545}He's a fucking genius, really.
{99546}{99617}This is Chad.|Can l have your phone number?
{99618}{99665}Hello. Great.|This is "Seduce and Destroy"?
{99666}{99743}Yes, it is. Can l have|your home phone number?
{99744}{99777}l don't want|to order anything.
{99778}{99845}l have a situation|that's just come up...
{99846}{99889}that's really pretty serious...
{99890}{99961}and l don't know who to talk to|or what l should do...
{99962}{100009}but maybe you could put me|in touch with somebody...
{100010}{100061}if l explain myself.?
{100062}{100111}We're really only equipped|to take orders here, sir.
{100112}{100193}It's just us with the phones,|and that's what we do.
{100194}{100281}Could you connect me with|somebody else,you think?
{100282}{100333}What's the situation?
{100334}{100381}OK, great.
{100382}{100464}Let me try to explain myself.|without it seeming crazy.
{100464}{100496}But here l go.
{100496}{100544}My name is Phil Parma...
{100545}{100617}and l work for a man|named Earl Partridge...
{100618}{100665}Mr. Earl Partridge.
{100666}{100733}I'm his nurse.|He's a very sick man.
{100734}{100805}He's a dying man,|and he's sick...
{100806}{100884}and he's asked me|to help him....
{100885}{100934}to help him find his son.
{100986}{101033}Hello? Are you there?
{101034}{101072}I'm here. I'm listening.
{101073}{101129}OK. You see...
{101130}{101215}Frank T.J. Mackey|is Earl Partridge's son.
{101216}{101261}So where are you|from originally?
{101262}{101325}-Around here.|-Valley?
{101326}{101397}-Hollywood, mainly.|-What did your parents do?
{101398}{101443}My father was in television.
{101444}{101497}My mother--This is going|to sound silly to you.
{101498}{101561}-Try me.|-She was a librarian.
{101562}{101601}Why does that sound silly?
{101602}{101649}l don't know.|l guess it doesn't.
{101650}{101681}Does your mother still work?
{101682}{101729}No, she's retired.
{101730}{101777}Are you close?
{101778}{101822}She's my mother.
{101823}{101889}Yes, but she's a woman,too.
{101890}{101962}How does she feel about|"Seduce and Destroy"?
{101962}{102006}What does she say?
{102056}{102141}Well, she says,|"You go get them, honey."
{102142}{102196}What about your father?
{102197}{102268}My father.|Unfortunately, he passed away.
{102269}{102320}I'm sorry.|l had no idea.
{102321}{102356}No, please.
{102357}{102414}l wouldn't have brought|that up if l had known.
{102415}{102448}It's a very hard thing.
{102449}{102496}Please.|Yes, it is, but...listen.
{102497}{102568}You have to move forward.|The past has its place.
{102569}{102665}It was a long time ago|and people die.
{102666}{102764}Let's switch gears here.
{102765}{102844}According to your book,|you ended up at UC Berkeley?
{102845}{102892}-'84-'89.|-Psychology major.
{102893}{102940}-That's right.|-Get your masters?
{102941}{102993}This close.
{102994}{103044}That's impressive in five years.
{103045}{103096}Cap, can l have some coffee?
{103097}{103144}Can l get you anything?
{103145}{103179}No, I'm good.
{103180}{103236}She's good.|l need coffee.
{103307}{103365}Cats and dogs out there., huh?
{103422}{103529}Must have a lot going on|for all that stuff back there.
{103530}{103576}You could...
{103577}{103644}You could have quite a party|with all that stuff.
{103707}{103790}You been on Prozac long?|Dexedrine?
{103791}{103827}l don't...
{103827}{103872}Interesting drugs.
{103873}{103946}Dexedrine's basically|speed in a pill,you know?
{103947}{103998}But l guess|a lot of the doctors...
{103999}{104074}are balancing out the Prozac|with the Dexedrine.
{104075}{104139}That liquid morphine|will knock you down, out...
{104139}{104200}around, up and down,|someone's not careful.
{104270}{104327}You can't mix those up.
{104760}{104831}Strong stuff here, boy.
{104832}{104912}What exactly you have wrong,|you need all this stuff?
{104912}{104983}-Mother fucker!|-What?
{104984}{105023}What are you talking about?
{105024}{105057}You fucking asshole!
{105058}{105105}Who the fuck|do you think you are?
{105106}{105149}l come in here...
{105150}{105197}you don't know who l am,|what my life is...
{105198}{105241}and you have the balls,|the indecency...
{105242}{105287}to ask me a question|about my life?
{105288}{105329}Please, lady,|why don't you just calm down?
{105330}{105373}Fuck you,too!|Don't you call me lady!
{105374}{105435}l come in here,|l give these things to you...
{105436}{105485}you check,|you make your phone calls...
{105486}{105533}look suspicious, ask questions!
{105534}{105569}I'm sick!
{105570}{105661}l have sickness all around me,|and you ask me my life?
{105662}{105693}What's wrong?
{105694}{105781}Have you seen death in your bed?|In your house?
{105782}{105825}Where's your fucking decency?
{105826}{105873}And then I'm asked|fucking questions.
{105874}{105949}What's...wrong?!
{105950}{106035}You suck my dick!|That's what's wrong!
{106036}{106092}And you fucking call me lady?!
{106093}{106197}Shame on you!
{106198}{106253}Shame on both of you!
{106294}{106349}So why don't they|have the same last name?
{106350}{106405}Because they don't|have the same last name.
{106406}{106491}l know, and l can't|really explain that.
{106492}{106604}But l have a feeling there is|a situation between them...
{106605}{106657}like they don't know|each other much or well.
{106658}{106765}Something like they don't|talk much any more, even.
{106766}{106838}God, does this sound weird?
{106838}{106889}l just don't understand|why you're calling me.
{106890}{107000}There's no number for Frank|in any of Earl's stuff...
{107001}{107048}and he's pretty out of it.
{107049}{107124}Like l said, he's dying...
{107125}{107192}dying of cancer. So...
{107193}{107268}-What kind of cancer?|-Brain and lung.
{107269}{107336}-My mother had breast cancer.|-I'm sorry.
{107337}{107412}-Is she all right?|-She's fine now.
{107413}{107476}-That's good.|-It was scary,though.
{107477}{107544}-It's a hell of a disease.|-It sure is.
{107545}{107618}Wait, I'm sorry.|So why call me?
{107619}{107724}l know this sounds silly,|and l might sound ridiculous...
{107725}{107772}like this is the scene|of the movie...
{107773}{107868}where the guy tries to get ahold|of the long-lost son...
{107869}{107938}but this is that scene.
{107939}{108014}And l think they have|those scenes in movies...
{108015}{108054}because they're true.
{108055}{108103}Because they really happen...
{108103}{108179}and you gotta believe me,|this is really happening.
{108215}{108304}l can give you my number|and you can go check with...
{108305}{108366}whoever you gotta check with|and call me back...
{108367}{108427}but do not leave me|hanging on this.
{108427}{108468}All right? Please.
{108469}{108552}I'm just--Please.
{108553}{108605}See...
{108653}{108743}this is the scene of the movie|where you help me out.
{108744}{108827}You're great.|These are great questions.
{108827}{108925}Good. l thought|you grew up in the Valley.
{108926}{108956}Like l said...around.
{108957}{109007}You went to Van Nuys High?
{109008}{109067}l wouldn't say l went.|I frequented.
{109067}{109096}l was misguided, pathetic.
{109097}{109143}Definitely not|the Frank T.J. Mackey...
{109144}{109207}you're so eagerly wanting|to put on national television.
{109208}{109255}Because l was swimming|in what was...
{109256}{109291}as opposed to what l wanted.
{109292}{109365}-Where does that name come from?|-My name?
{109366}{109413}It's not your given name?
{109414}{109461}It's my mother's name, actually.
{109462}{109509}That's good.|Done your research.
{109510}{109577}-And Frank?|-My mother's father.
{109578}{109661}That's why.|See, l had some trouble...
{109662}{109738}locating your school records|at UCLA and Berkeley.
{109739}{109787}It's your name change...
{109788}{109833}because they had|no official enrollment for you.
{109834}{109892}No,they wouldn't.
{109892}{109953}No. Because l was never|officially enrolled there.
{109954}{110013}-Was that unclear?|-Kind of.
{110014}{110085}God, l wouldn't want|that to be misunderstood.
{110086}{110168}My enrollment|was totally unofficial.
{110168}{110216}Sadly, l couldn't afford|to pay the tuition up there.
{110217}{110257}But there were|three wonderful professors...
{110258}{110303}kind enough to let me|to sit in their classes.
{110304}{110364}Macready, Horn, and Langtree,|among others.
{110365}{110413}You're welcome|to call them if you like.
{110414}{110460}l didn't get a free ride.
{110461}{110548}So what we're looking at here|is a true rags-to-riches story.
{110549}{110613}That's why people respond|so strongly to "Seduce."
{110614}{110661}Because at the end of the day...
{110662}{110721}"Seduce" may not be just|about picking up chicks...
{110722}{110765}and sticking your cock in.
{110766}{110840}It's about finding out|what you can be in this world...
{110841}{110900}defining it,|controlling it, and saying...
{110901}{110965}"l will take what is mine."
{110966}{111041}And you just happen to get|a little blow job out of it...
{111042}{111088}then, hey,what the fuck?
{111089}{111118}There you go.
{111119}{111188}End of Round One.|Excellent work.
{111189}{111284}l think we should take|a look at the scores here.
{111285}{111332}Kids are up a leg with 1,500...
{111333}{111404}and the adults are down|a little bit with 1025.
{111405}{111490}So we'll be back for Round Two|in a ring-dang-doo!
{111491}{111581}Hello, hello!|Bonus musical question.
{111582}{111629}And the winner is...
{111721}{111751}Kids!
{111813}{111848}Kids are in the lead.
{111849}{111916}They get a chance to pull|further and farther ahead...
{111917}{112016}if they answer the following|secret bonus musical question.
{112017}{112100}Now what I'm going to do|is read a line from an opera.
{112101}{112148}l want you to give me|that line back...
{112149}{112208}in the language in which the|opera was originally written.
{112209}{112314}And for a bonus 250--250...
{112315}{112372}you can sing it!
{112373}{112434}Here's the line.
{112435}{112538}"Love is a rebellious bird|that nobody can tame.
{112539}{112610}"And it's all in vain|to call it...
{112611}{112646}"if it chooses to refuse."
{112695}{112758}Well,that was in French...
{112759}{112816}and that was from|the opera "Carmen..."
{112817}{112874}and that goes...
{112875}{112950}L'amour est|un oiseau rebelle
{112951}{113042}Que nul ne peut apprivoiser
{113043}{113130}Et c'est bien en vain|qu'on l'appelle
{113131}{113221}S'il lui convient de refuser
{113359}{113419}See you got|some coffee brewing here.
{113419}{113491}Yeah, it's not--|It's been on for a bit.
{113491}{113542}l like iced coffee, generally...
{113543}{113636}but a day like today,|with the rain and whatnot...
{113637}{113686}l enjoy a warm cup.
{113828}{113878}Do you want a cup?
{113879}{113925}Is that all right?
{113926}{113973}It's raining|cats and dogs out there.
{113974}{114046}I'd just as soon|not go back in it.
{114048}{114140}l don't know how fresh|it's going to be.
{114141}{114195}I'm sure it's fine, Claudia.
{114282}{114365}Do you take cream or sugar?
{114366}{114413}That'd be fine.
{114414}{114469}So, Claudia,|let me just say...
{114470}{114533}so l can get my role|as an LAPD officer...
{114534}{114597}out of the way here|before we enjoy our coffee.
{114598}{114656}l don't like to talk shop|over coffee.
{114657}{114710}I'm not going to write you up.
{114711}{114769}I'm not going to give you|a citation here...
{114770}{114865}but the real problem is that|you got people around you...
{114866}{114956}people who work from home,|trying to get work done.
{114956}{115009}And if you're listening|to your music that loud...
{115010}{115085}they're inconvenienced by that.
{115086}{115181}IF you had a job,|you'd probably understand...
{115182}{115241}but you like listening|to your music.
{115242}{115301}That's fine.
{115302}{115406}Just want to keep an eye|on the volume level.
{115407}{115496}Maybe memorize what number|you see on the dial.
{115497}{115558}IF it's the middle of the day,|that's what l do.
{115559}{115605}l just set it|at two and a half...
{115606}{115677}and then l know that's|a good listening level for me.
{115678}{115758}But you like listening|to your music loud.
{115782}{115825}That's fine.|That's cool.
{115826}{115876}It's good to rock out sometimes.
{115877}{115924}But you can't do it every day...
{115925}{115996}or else you risk damaging|your ears. Seriously.
{116085}{116165}You listen to it|all the time like that?
{116166}{116217}You're going to drive|these people crazy.
{116218}{116294}Anyway,you get the point.
{116386}{116422}Cheers.
{116654}{116704}So this boyfriend bothering you?
{116705}{116752}l don't have a boyfriend.
{116753}{116800}The gentleman|who was at the door...
{116801}{116843}He's not my boyfriend.
{116913}{116996}A lot of times,|in domestic abuse situations...
{116997}{117060}the young woman|is afraid to speak out.
{117061}{117152}You don't have to be afraid|to tell me anything.
{117153}{117224}And as a police officer,|l can tell you...
{117225}{117292}it goes bad places.
{117293}{117340}Young woman's|afraid to speak out...
{117341}{117400}next thing you know,|I'm here on a 187.
{117401}{117458}What's a 187?
{117459}{117504}It's not good.
{117505}{117580}And it's where situations|like this always lead.
{117581}{117634}It's not my boyfriend,|and it's not anything.
{117635}{117716}It's over. Really.|He won't come back.
{117717}{117763}l don't want to have|to come back here...
{117764}{117796}You won't have to!
{117863}{117952}l wouldn't mind coming back.
{117953}{118034}You know, get a look|at your pretty face again.
{118035}{118065}I'll be right back.
{118231}{118311}Here you go.|Let's get the jacket off.
{118312}{118359}It'll help you to breathe.
{118399}{118439}l can't fucking do this.
{118529}{118592}I've--l...
{118593}{118677}l think I'm gonna throw up.|l think.
{118735}{118832}l haven't thrown up|since l was twenty years old.
{118948}{119006}-What's the problem?|-l need to go to the bathroom.
{119007}{119066}Jesus Christ, Stanley.|You can't go now.
{119068}{119131}You have exactly one minute|before we're on the air.
{119132}{119175}Now is not the time|to go to the bathroom!
{119176}{119248}Why does this fucking|shit always happen, Stanley?
{119249}{119280}Excuse me, is there a problem?
{119281}{119319}Mind your own business!
{119320}{119367}You watch your mouth,young man!
{119368}{119419}Why don't you mind|your own business?
{119420}{119452}Oh, no, she didn't!
{119452}{119559}Wait for the commercial break,|then you can go.
{119560}{119608}Just hold it.
{119608}{119680}Don't taunt the kids.
{119681}{119748}-I'm trying to be helpful.|-Don't start trouble.
{119748}{119820}You haven't seen trouble!|Wait till next commercial break.
{119821}{119882}-What's the problem?|-Nothing.
{119883}{119945}Lily! Please!
{119946}{119995}Get away from me,you shit head!
{120146}{120188}Watch out,watch out.
{120529}{120558}Don't eat these.
{120767}{120809}Here you go.
{121097}{121161}Out of the trash!
{121201}{121280}Phil, are you there?|It's Chad.
{121281}{121364}I'm going to put you in touch|with Janet, Frank's assistant.
{121365}{121416}And she'll see what she can do,|all right?
{121417}{121496}Thank you., and good luck|to you and your mother.
{121497}{121568}Thanks, man. You,too.|Janet, are you there?
{121569}{121622}All right,Janet,|you have Phil Parma.
{121777}{121903}l have cancer, Mary.|l have about two months.
{121904}{121972}l have no time.|It's in my bones.
{121973}{122036}l don't have a chance.
{122037}{122066}l'm fucked.
{122186}{122250}And fifteen seconds.
{122331}{122373}Ten seconds.
{122432}{122563}And five,four,three,two...
{122563}{122618}We're back,|ready for Round Two!
{122620}{122697}And we're talking to our|adult contestants here today.
{122698}{122757}Mim, it says here that you live|in Chatsworth, California...
{122758}{122786}and that you have two kids.
{122787}{122830}That's right.|l have a six-year-old...
{122831}{122889}Do you know who l am?
{122890}{122953}You're a friend. of the family,|l presume.
{122954}{122999}What does that mean?
{122999}{123071}Nothing special.|Just a spoke in the wheel.
{123071}{123175}You talk in rhymes|and riddles and Rub-a-Dub.
{123176}{123226}But that doesn't mean|anything to me.
{123227}{123275}See, l used to be smart.
{123276}{123323}I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith.
{123375}{123443}I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith|from TV.
{123443}{123491}It might have been|before my time.
{123491}{123574}l remember.|In the Sixties, right?
{123576}{123643}-I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith.|-Like you said.
{123644}{123691}Smart kid!
{123692}{123742}You got struck|by lightning once.
{123743}{123768}So what?
{123769}{123835}-l heard about that.|-Did it hurt?
{123874}{123947}But you're all right now.|So what's the what?
{123948}{124001}-What?|-That's right.
{124002}{124117}l used to be smart.|Now I'm just stupid.
{124118}{124182}Brad, dear,|who was it that said...
{124183}{124278}"A man of genius has seldom|been ruined but by himself"?
{124334}{124407}It was|the lovely Samuel Johnson.
{124408}{124481}Who also spoke of a fellow|"who was not only dull...
{124482}{124539}"but a cause of dullness|in others"?
{124540}{124578}"The cause of dullness|in others."
{124579}{124606}Picky, picky!
{124607}{124651}Let me tell you this.
{124652}{124721}Samuel Johnson never|had his life shit on...
{124722}{124801}and taken from him|and his money stolen!
{124802}{124857}Who took his life and his money?
{124858}{124947}His parents?|His mommy and daddy?
{124948}{125015}Make him live this life|like this...
{125016}{125117}A man of genius who gets|shit on as a child...
{125118}{125185}and that scars! That hurts!
{125186}{125238}Have you ever been|hit by lightning?
{125239}{125333}It hurts.|It doesn't happen to everyone.
{125334}{125372}It's an electrical charge.
{125373}{125424}It finds its way|across the universe...
{125425}{125538}and it lands in your body|and your head!
{125539}{125664}And as for ruined|but by himself...
{125665}{125735}not if his parents|took his freaking life...
{125736}{125794}and his money|and tell you to do this...
{125795}{125864}and to do that,|and if you don't...
{125865}{125936}Your parents took your money|you won on that game show?
{125937}{126004}Yes! They did.
{126079}{126162}What does that mean,|a spoke in the wheel?
{126162}{126228}Things go round and round,|don't they?
{126229}{126304}Yes,they do. They do.
{126305}{126377}But I'll make my dreams|come true.
{126378}{126457}Sounds sad as a weeping willow.
{126458}{126506}l used to be smart.
{126507}{126571}But now I'm just stupid.
{126613}{126658}Shall we drink to that?
{126658}{126738}l want to talk a little bit more|about your background.
{126739}{126798}You made|some references earlier...
{126798}{126920}to subjective human experiences|and terrible things...
{126921}{127005}Actually,|I'm confused about your past.
{127006}{127070}Is that still lingering?
{127071}{127104}It's so boring.
{127105}{127147}Just want to clear|some things up.
{127148}{127216}Excuse me.|Thank you., Muff.
{127217}{127266}It's a funny thing that...
{127267}{127325}This is an important element|of "Seduce and Destroy..."
{127326}{127410}facing the past is an important|way of not making progress.
{127411}{127483}This is something l tell my men|over and over and over.
{127483}{127519}This isn't meant...
{127519}{127579}l try to teach|my students to ask...
{127579}{127627}"What is it in aid of?"
{127627}{127702}Are you asking me that?
{127703}{127752}Well, in trying to|figure out who you are...
{127753}{127794}In aid of what?
{127795}{127878}Frank, I'm saying that|in trying to figure out...
{127879}{127985}l have more important things|to put myself. into.
{127986}{128030}l think this is|something important...
{128031}{128100}you might need to think about|putting yourself into.
{128101}{128128}Not really.
{128129}{128221}It's not like I'm trying|to attack you here.
{128222}{128311}This is how you want to spend|your time, go, go, go.
{128311}{128362}But you'll be surprised|at what a waste it is.
{128364}{128419}The most useless thing|in the world...
{128419}{128474}is that which is behind me.|Chapter Three.
{128504}{128556}We talked earlier|about your mother...
{128557}{128617}and about|your father and his death.
{128618}{128711}l don't want to be challenging,|but l have to ask.
{128712}{128867}l just want to clarify|something that l understand...
{128868}{128940}I'm not sure|l hear a question in here.
{128940}{129012}I'm trying to put this|as delicately as l can.
{129013}{129061}What's the question?
{129062}{129105}Do you remember Miss Simms?
{129106}{129173}l know a lot of women.|I'm sure she remembers me.
{129174}{129251}From when you were a boy.|She lived in Tarzana.
{129252}{129313}That's my old stomping ground.
{129371}{129481}Is this the attack portion|of the interview?
{129482}{129530}Is the girl coming in|for the kill?
{129531}{129581}No. This is about|getting something right...
{129582}{129653}and clarifying your answers|to an earlier question.
{129654}{129685}What question?
{129686}{129753}l was told that|your mother died, Frank.
{129946}{129995}That's what you heard.
{130045}{130096}Do you remember Miss Simms?
{130246}{130333}l talked to Miss Simms,|your neighbor and caretaker...
{130334}{130417}after your mother died in 1980.
{130418}{130501}And in my research...
{130502}{130638}l have you as the only son|of Earl and Lily Partridge.
{130639}{130689}And what l learned|from Barbara Simms...
{130690}{130831}is that your mother, Lily,|died in 1980.
{130832}{130918}So, it's my understanding|that information supplied...
{130919}{130994}by you and your company|and the answers...
{130995}{131051}to the questions I've asked|is incorrect, Frank.
{131052}{131108}And if l want to get|to the bottom...
{131109}{131158}of who you are|and why you are...
{131159}{131212}then l think that|your family history...
{131213}{131290}your actual family history...
{131291}{131413}Well,this is important.
{131459}{131528}What is your fucking question?
{131593}{131700}Well, l guess|my question's this...
{131701}{131777}Why would you lie, Frank?
{131811}{131894}Kids...adults...
{131895}{131972}l would like you|to put yourself at a picnic.
{131973}{132051}Place yourself there with|your family and friends...
{132052}{132089}if you'd like.
{132090}{132161}You'll hear three musical notes,|and you are to tell me...
{132162}{132256}what it might represent|that you would find at a picnic.
{132257}{132303}The first three notes.|Guys.
{132439}{132466}Yes,Todd.
{132467}{132506}Well,Jimmy, l know this.
{132507}{132590}l have perfect pitch,|and that would be A-D-E...
{132591}{132639}and that would represent|lemonade.
{132639}{132701}For 250.|Next notes, please.
{132827}{132924}Got it. That's E-G-G,|which would be egg.
{132925}{133010}For 500. And the third|set of notes. Guys?
{133097}{133136}You don't want any water?
{133137}{133182}No. l just...
{133183}{133231}I'm so fucked up|right now,Alan.
{133232}{133278}There's just so much,|so many things.
{133279}{133322}Are you on drugs right now?
{133323}{133418}IF l tell you something,|you're a lawyer, right?
{133419}{133466}You can't say anything,|tell anybody.
{133467}{133510}It's like a privilege.|Attorney/Client.
{133511}{133558}-You understand?|-Not exactly.
{133559}{133586}Like a shrink.
{133587}{133634}IF l go see a shrink,|I'm protected.
{133635}{133682}l can say things--Fuck!
{133683}{133727}l don't know what I'm doing.

{134463}{134565}When l met him, I fucked him,|and l married him...
{134566}{134626}because l wanted his money.|You understand?
{134627}{134669}I'm telling you this...
{134670}{134725}I've never told anyone,|l didn't love him...

{135254}{135298}As you probably heard by now...
{135299}{135345}we sure gave that Pope|a run for his money.
{135393}{135450}That would be Robert E. Lee.
{135451}{135546}His wife was Mary Parke Custis.|l know he had seven children.
{135548}{135616}And he would be|talking about Pope...
{135617}{135665}who he defeated|at the Battle of Manassas.
{135666}{135742}Absolutely right, Miss Mim.|Next question.
{135743}{135815}Come on.|Snap out of it, man.
{135816}{135859}Come on, Stanley.
{135912}{135942}Bonjour,Josephine.
{135943}{136017}Maintenant|je suis en Egypte.
{136018}{136045}Yes, Mim.
{136046}{136111}That would be Napoleon|speaking to Josephine.
{136112}{136196}Absolutely right,for 500.|Next voice.
{136197}{136253}l don't want him to die.
{136254}{136309}l didn't love him when we met...
{136310}{136380}and l did so many bad things|to him that he doesn't know.
{136380}{136417}Things that|l want to confess to him...
{136418}{136488}But now l do. l love him.
{136489}{136558}Linda,what kind of|medication are you on?
{136559}{136609}This isn't any fucking|medication talking!
{136610}{136686}Can you give me nothing?|You have power of attorney.
{136687}{136769}Can you go in the final moments|and change the will?
{136770}{136820}l don't want any money.
{136821}{136912}l couldn't live with myself.|with this thing that I've done.
{136913}{136990}I fucked around.|I fucking cheated on him.
{136991}{137054}There.|You're his lawyer, our lawyer.
{137055}{137120}l am his wife. l broke|the contract of marriage.
{137121}{137167}I fucked around on him|many times.
{137168}{137220}l sucked other men's cocks.
{137221}{137267}Adultery is not|against the law.
{137268}{137341}You can't use it in court|to discredit the will.
{137342}{137399}-Linda, calm down.|-l can't.
{137400}{137451}You don't have|to change the will.
{137452}{137535}IF you want nothing, renounce|the will when the time comes.
{137536}{137584}What does that mean?|Where does the money go?
{137585}{137628}It goes to the nearest relative.
{137629}{137704}What's that?|That's Frank?
{137705}{137764}No. That can't happen.
{137765}{137796}Earl doesn't want him|to have anything.
{137797}{137828}That's what will happen.
{137829}{137871}This is so fucked up|l can hardly stand it.
{137872}{137899}Linda, stop!
{137900}{137981}Now,you take a moment,|you breathe...
{137982}{138029}and one thing at a time.
{138030}{138090}-Shut the fuck up.|-Want me to help you?
{138091}{138150}-Shut the fuck up!|-You need to sober up.
{138151}{138210}Now,you must really|shut the fuck up.
{138210}{138248}Please, shut the fuck up.
{138249}{138302}l have to go.
{138303}{138380}-Let me call you a car.|-Shut the fuck up!
{138381}{138480}Now, imagine that you|are attending a jam session...
{138481}{138539}of classical composers...
{138540}{138578}and they have each done|an arrangement...
{138579}{138647}of the classic favorite|"Whispering."
{138648}{138728}Now,we have here|the New World Harmonica Trio...
{138729}{138801}who are going to play...
{138802}{138914}three variations on the theme...
{138915}{139014}as three classical composers|might have written it.
{139014}{139103}So you are to name|the first composer.
{139104}{139133}Guys.
{139446}{139473}Yes,Todd.
{139474}{139514}That sounded like Brahms.
{139515}{139580}A bit like his|"Hungarian Dance Number Six."
{139581}{139661}That is excellent,Todd.|Next composer, guys.
{140314}{140346}Stanley the man.
{140374}{140436}l don't know the answer.
{140437}{140511}That is not right.
{140512}{140555}That's not right, Stanley.
{140556}{140630}The correct answer is Ravel.
{140661}{140692}Ravel.
{140724}{140861}And now I'm gonna|have our three whistlers...
{140862}{140957}please to present|the next musical...
{140958}{141036}There were three|musical sections here...
{141037}{141128}and this'll be the third section|that the whistlers...
{141128}{141217}and they'll|play a piece that's...
{141218}{141299}It's very recognizable.|Chopin, actually.
{141300}{141437}And it's in the style|of "Marche Militaire."
{141438}{141510}It's a very recognizable piece.
{141511}{141595}So if you please|just listen to this...
{141597}{141698}and I'm sure|you can identify the...
{141699}{141748}I'm sort of giving away|the answer here.
{141749}{141821}It's Chopin. l don't mean|to give away the answer.
{141821}{141894}It's just--please just...
{141895}{141980}Well, sing us a ditty, guys.|A Chopin ditty.
{141981}{142065}Let's have a Chopin ditty here.|l can't...

{153310}{153379}Well,the kids|have an even 2,000...
{153380}{153484}and the adults|are way up with forty-seven.
{153485}{153534}Now,that doesn't mean|that this game...
{153535}{153617}is out of reach for the kids.

{156316}{156421}It's a dangerous thing|to confuse children with angels.
{156421}{156498}Want to know the common element|for the entire group?
{156499}{156559}I'll tell you the answer,|because l had that one.
{156560}{156606}l had that question.
{156607}{156687}Carbon. Carbon.
{156688}{156740}In pencil lead,|it's in the form of graphite.
{156741}{156816}In coal, it's mixed up|with other impurities.
{156817}{156891}And in the diamond,|it's in hard form.
{156892}{156994}All we really wanted to know|was the common element...
{156995}{157039}but thank you for all|that unnecessary knowledge.
{157040}{157117}Kids. Heads so full|of useless knowledge.
{157118}{157151}Thank you. Thank you.
{157190}{157249}And the book says, "We may be|through with the past...
{157250}{157330}"but the past is not|through with us!"
{157331}{157375}And...
{157376}{157431}no, it is not dangerous...
{157432}{157485}to confuse children with angels.
{157824}{157917}Well,that is what l wait for.
{157918}{158001}l wait for those calls.|And l wait and l pray.
{158002}{158074}And sometimes Jesus says...
{158074}{158133}"Jim, l got a surprise|for you today.
{158134}{158196}"l want you to meet|this young lady, OK?
{158197}{158266}"Now,where it goes|from there is up to you.
{158267}{158332}"And l don't think|you're going to screw it up."
{158333}{158404}And, God,|I'm telling you right now...
{158405}{158452}l will not screw it up.
{158453}{158493}You gave me an opportunity.
{158494}{158536}I'm going to treat|this young lady right.
{158537}{158613}I'm a happy cop.
{158614}{158694}It's called jaywalking.|Slow down.
{159426}{159484}I'm going to pass,Jimmy.
{159485}{159559}Stanley, passing|to one of the other kids.
{159594}{159656}We want Stanley to go,Jimmy.
{159689}{159762}l don't want to go.
{159763}{159809}I'm walking towards|the elevator,Janet.
{159810}{159851}Fine. Phil,|are you still there?
{159852}{159879}Yeah, I'm here.
{159880}{159915}l want to ask you one question.
{159916}{159982}Phil, have you talked|to anyone else about this.?
{159983}{160006}No, l haven't.

{160054}{160108}All the security and whatnot.|You understand?
{160109}{160172}This is a delicate situation|for Frank and the family.
{160173}{160206}What's going on,Janet?
{160207}{160240}Doc,fuck off.

{160593}{160702}We want Stanley to go,Jimmy,|and we're not sure why he won't.
{160703}{160772}l always answer the questions...
{160773}{160812}and l don't want|to do it anymore.
{160813}{160902}What the fuck is he doing?|What's wrong with him?
{160903}{160937}l have no idea.
{161021}{161068}I'm getting off of the elevator,|Janet.
{161069}{161138}Good. Good boy.
{161139}{161222}I'm walking down the hall.
{162398}{162505}This kid ain't getting up,|we don't have a show.
{162506}{162557}Live television,|ladies and germs.
{162558}{162597}Little prick.
{162598}{162666}What's this, a point?|A game?
{162666}{162711}What the hell's he doing?
{162712}{162809}Get the fuck up, kid, come on.
{162927}{162958}Time's up.
{163002}{163074}So that's what you did?|You sat it out?
{163106}{163200}You wanted my time.|l gave ti you.
{163201}{163280}You called me a liar.|You made accusations.
{163281}{163354}You said,|"Well, if l had known...
{163355}{163400}"then l wouldn't have asked."
{163401}{163462}So it's not an attack.
{163463}{163566}l don't want to be the sort|who doesn't keep his word.
{163567}{163623}So l gave you|my fucking time, bitch.
{163623}{163651}Now,fuck...
{163810}{163837}It's fucking Janet.
{163838}{163878}There's a situation|on the phone.
{164416}{164491}The indecision of a child,|ladies and germs.
{164772}{164855}This isn't funny.
{164856}{164907}This isn't cute.
{164908}{164955}See,the way we're looked at?
{165016}{165079}Because I'm not a toy.
{165080}{165118}I'm not a doll.
{165119}{165216}The way we're looked at|because you think we're cute?
{165217}{165264}Because--What?

{168050}{168081}What did he say?

{174896}{174936}That's not an official rule,|Luis.
{174937}{174992}That's an official rule, baby.
{174993}{175023}That's bullshit,|and you know it!
{175024}{175073}Who says that?|In what rule book?

{181549}{181667}You are here for me|to enlighten you, edify you...
{181668}{181758}to send you off into the now|not-so-unknown future.
{181759}{181804}So come along with me.
{181805}{181876}"How to fake like you|are nice and caring."
{181877}{181932}No, l don't want a microphone.
{181933}{181979}Now,this...
{181980}{182033}this is quite|an important chapter...
{182034}{182093}as you will see.
{182094}{182127}But let's get down|to brass tacks.
{182128}{182214}Let's get right down to it,|boys.
{182215}{182303}Men are shit.
{182341}{182475}What? Men are shit.
{182476}{182526}Isn't that what they say?
{182527}{182565}Because we do bad things,|don't we?
{182566}{182706}We do horrible, heinous,|terrible things.
{182707}{182848}Things that no woman|would ever do.
{182849}{182921}No,women,they don't lie.
{182922}{182972}No,women don't cheat.
{182973}{183040}Women don't manipulate us.
{183093}{183175}But you see what I'm getting at.
{183176}{183218}You see what society does?
{183219}{183310}Little boys, it's, "Wow,woman!"
{183359}{183394}We are taught to apologize.
{183395}{183436}"l am sorry.
{183437}{183504}"l am so sorry, baby.|l am so sorry."
{183597}{183652}What is it that...
{183653}{183714}What is it that we need?
{183715}{183820}Is it their pussies?|Their love?
{183821}{183866}Mommy wouldn't|let me play soccer...
{183867}{183973}and Daddy, he hit me,|so that's who l am.
{183974}{184029}That's why l do what l do?
{184030}{184083}Fucking bullshit.
{184194}{184298}l will not apologize|for who l am.
{184299}{184389}l will not apologize|for what l need.
{184390}{184519}l will not apologize|for what l want!
{184558}{184592}Go to your blue booklets now.
{184593}{184689}l want you to turn to page 18|in your blue booklets.
{184723}{184827}This is fucking bullshit!
{184828}{184917}l want you to go|to your white books.
{184918}{184975}That's what l want you to go to.
{184976}{185032}Go to twenty-three|in your white books.
{185071}{185162}"How to fake like you are|a nice and caring person."
{185333}{185411}Hey, come here.
{185532}{185590}I'm...
{185591}{185665}I'm gonna try talk.
{185666}{185726}You know, I'm trying to...
{185727}{185764}to say something-something.
{185809}{185885}Do you know Lily, Phil?|Do you know her?
{185949}{185998}No, l don't.
{185999}{186129}She's my love, my life,|love of it.
{186130}{186186}In school...
{186187}{186285}I'm twelve years old in school,|in sixth grade.
{186286}{186323}l saw her.
{186354}{186434}l didn't go to that school,|but...
{186469}{186538}but we met.
{186539}{186606}My friend knew her.
{186607}{186678}l said...
{186679}{186748}"What's that girl?|How's that Lily?"
{186749}{186857}"Oh, she's bad.|She sleeps with guys."
{186858}{186952}Yeah, he said this,|but then sometimes...
{186953}{187031}l went to another school,|you see.
{187032}{187125}But then...
{187126}{187194}When high school at an end,|what's that?
{187195}{187262}What is that when|it gets to the end?
{187262}{187291}Graduation.
{187292}{187357}No, no,the grade.|What grade are you in?
{187358}{187464}That's 12th.
{187465}{187576}So l went to her school|for that grade.
{187577}{187650}Grade--that's grade twelve.
{187651}{187700}And we meet.
{187735}{187763}She was...
{187805}{187865}fucking like a doll.
{187908}{187991}A beautiful porcelain doll.
{187991}{188038}And the hips...
{188039}{188094}The child-bearing hips,|you know that?
{188095}{188127}l know.
{188128}{188209}So beautiful.
{188347}{188395}And l cheated on her...
{188396}{188542}over and over and over again.
{188543}{188602}Because l wanted to be a man.
{188603}{188695}And l didn't want her|to be a woman.
{188696}{188886}A smart,free person|who was something.
{188888}{188942}My fucking mind then.
{189006}{189053}So stupid,that fucking mind.
{189054}{189100}Stupid.
{189100}{189148}Jesus Christ!
{189188}{189232}What would l think?
{189232}{189306}Did l think for what I'd done?
{189348}{189432}She was my wife|for twenty-three years...
{189433}{189555}and l went behind her|over and over.
{189556}{189590}Fucking asshole that l am.
{189591}{189666}I'd go out and I'd fuck...
{189667}{189760}and I'd come home|and get in her bed...
{189761}{189870}and say, "l love you."
{189871}{189953}This is Jack's mother.
{189954}{190020}His mother, Lily.
{190021}{190056}These two...
{190109}{190139}that l had...
{190207}{190246}and l lost.
{190309}{190414}This is the regret|that you make.

{206855}{206930}Linda? No, she went out.|She's not here.

{207035}{207091}Your dad asked me|to get in touch with you...

{209296}{209334}What's wrong with you?
{210157}{210187}Here.
{210502}{210550}How do we do this,then?
{210603}{210665}Well,we just do it.
{210666}{210747}We do it.|We figure it out.
{210748}{210804}We do as we do, l guess.
{210850}{210892}Do you love me, Rose?
{210918}{210972}You are my handsome man.
{211022}{211067}I'm a bad person.
{211139}{211183}l mean...
{211184}{211257}I'm telling you this now...
{211258}{211340}because l want everything|to be clear and clean...
{211341}{211433}and l want to apologize for me|and the stupid things I've done.
{211503}{211546}I've cheated on you.
{211606}{211716}I've cheated on you,|and...it kills me...
{211717}{211796}and the guilt|of what I've done...
{211797}{211853}l don't want you|to think that...
{211903}{211941}Maybe you knew.
{211975}{212017}l think maybe you've known.
{212044}{212133}So l hope this is not|just for me...
{212134}{212227}for me to make myself feel|better about what I've done...
{212228}{212300}but for you not to feel|like you're sitting there...
{212301}{212348}like a jerk.
{212349}{212410}You're the good one.
{212411}{212447}You understand?
{212475}{212580}Did you ever go out|with someone and just lie...
{212581}{212649}question after question?
{212650}{212713}Maybe you're trying to|make yourself look cool...
{212714}{212772}or better than you are|or whatever...
{212773}{212832}smarter, cooler...
{212832}{212871}and you just...
{212917}{212950}Not really lie...
{212951}{213020}but maybe you just don't|say everything.
{213020}{213075}That's a natural thing.
{213076}{213180}You know,two people go out|on a date or something.
{213180}{213226}They want to impress people...
{213227}{213273}the other person.
{213274}{213323}Or they're scared|they'll say something...
{213324}{213396}that will make the other person|not like them.
{213436}{213481}-Thank you.|-Thank you.
{213512}{213552}So you've done it?
{213601}{213655}l don't go out very often.
{213656}{213684}Why not?
{213731}{213851}l never found someone, really,|that I'd like to go out with.
{213852}{213923}l bet you say that|to all the girls.
{214013}{214082}Want to make a deal with me?
{214121}{214157}What l just said...
{214158}{214246}people afraid to say things...
{214247}{214349}no guts to say the things|that are real or something...
{214376}{214419}to not do that.
{214420}{214540}To not do that|that maybe we've done before.
{214613}{214654}Let's make a deal.
{214687}{214795}I'll tell you everything,|and you tell me everything...
{214796}{214873}and maybe we can get through|all the piss, shit, and lies...
{214873}{214927}that kill other people.
{215081}{215128}"Piss and shit."
{215130}{215159}What?
{215160}{215256}You really use strong language.
{215257}{215285}I'm sorry.
{215286}{215373}No, it's fine.
{215374}{215450}l didn't mean--It seems vulgar|or something, l know.
{215451}{215485}-It's fine.|-I'm sorry.
{215486}{215518}It's nothing.|I'm sorry.
{215518}{215656}I'm gonna run to the bathroom|for a minute maybe,just...
{218003}{218085}I'm going to go in.|Are the dogs in there?
{218086}{218139}Yeah, but they stay|by the window.
{218140}{218229}l want you to come in with me|and stay away from me.
{218230}{218272}l want you there|in case he needs anything...
{218273}{218348}because l am not|going to help him.
{218349}{218435}And, Phil, l will drop-kick|the fucking dogs...
{218436}{218477}if they come near me.
{219135}{219183}You don't look that bad.
{219573}{219614}You prick.
{219756}{219821}"Cock sucker." That's what you|used to like to say, right?
{219822}{219852}"Cock sucker."
{219906}{219955}But you are a cock sucker., Earl.
{219993}{220035}It hurts, doesn't it?

{220970}{221047}She waited for your call.
{221143}{221182}For you to come.
{221371}{221452}l am not going to cry.
{221453}{221548}l am not going to cry for you!
{221691}{221769}You cock sucker.,|l know you can hear me.
{221770}{221879}l want you to know|that l hate your fucking guts.

{221982}{222054}And l hope it hurts.|I fucking hope it hurts.
{223105}{223160}Her resps are down to six.
{223161}{223220}Let's get the gurney over here.

{223440}{223497}With the neck|of a long-time oppressor
{223498}{223535}And he's runnin' from the devil
{223537}{223581}But the debt is always gainin'
{223582}{223622}And if he's worth bein' hurt
{223623}{223662}He's worth bringin' pain in
{224155}{224264}Do you feel better|now that you've said this?
{224265}{224304}l don't know.
{224343}{224411}Well, I'm not...mad.

{229777}{229812}"You touched me wrong.|l know that."

{232492}{232540}Why didn't you call?
{232928}{233001}I fucking hate you.
{233064}{233174}God damn you,fucking asshole.

{234078}{234158}What the fuck am l doing?
{237515}{237550}Oh,fuck.
{238068}{238140}What?
{238217}{238265}What are you doing, dummy?
{238296}{238336}Oh, brother.
{241497}{241574}There are frogs|falling from the sky.
{244634}{244690}Come on! Come on!
{245133}{245195}Claudia, it's Mom!|Open the door, honey!
{245234}{245295}Claudia, are you there?
{245296}{245359}Mom! Mom! Mom! Mommy!
{245360}{245397}All right. All right.
{245399}{245459}It's OK.|It's all right now.
{245460}{245557}It's OK.|It's gonna be all right.
{245810}{245863}This happens.
{245864}{245912}This is something that happens.
{247944}{248051}And there is the account|of the hanging of three men...
{248052}{248089}and a scuba diver...
{248090}{248139}and a suicide.
{248361}{248459}There are stories of|coincidence and chance...
{248460}{248535}and intersections|and strange things told...
{248536}{248605}and which is which|and who only knows?
{248729}{248759}And we generally say...
{248760}{248849}"Well, if that was in a movie,|l wouldn't believe it."
{248850}{248922}Someone's so-and-so|met someone else's so-and-so...
{248923}{248964}and so on.
{248965}{249041}And it is in the humble opinion|of this narrator...
{249042}{249101}that strange things|happen all the time.
{249102}{249155}And so it goes, and so it goes.
{249156}{249202}And the book says...
{249203}{249254}"We may be through|with the past...
{249255}{249316}but the past|ain't through with us."
{249421}{249478}I'm sorry,Jack.
{249478}{249546}It's the hospital|calling about Linda.
{249546}{249573}Who?
{249574}{249628}Linda.|She's in the hospital.
{249629}{249720}I figured you should probably|talk to them since you're here.
{249991}{250069}Is she gonna be all right?
{250172}{250305}Could you please tell me|where you're located?
{250728}{250796}Are you with us, Linda? Good.
{250797}{250839}It is, Linda, isn't it?
{250952}{251023}Just relax. That's it.
{251076}{251111}You'll get through this.
{251396}{251426}Dad.
{251618}{251682}Dad,you need to be nicer to me.
{251720}{251762}Go to bed.
{251806}{251870}You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
{251957}{251993}Go to bed.
{252184}{252284}l know l did a stupid thing.
{252285}{252340}So stupid.
{252341}{252405}Getting braces.
{252406}{252436}l thought...
{252484}{252532}l thought he would love me.
{252533}{252610}Getting...braces.
{252611}{252640}For what?
{252641}{252722}For something l don't even...
{252787}{252859}l don't know where|to put things,you know?
{252945}{253015}l really do have love to give.
{253016}{253080}l just don't know|where to put it.
{253325}{253415}A lot of people think this is|just a job that you go to.
{253453}{253534}Take a lunch hour...|job's over.
{253535}{253565}Something like that.
{253623}{253672}But it's a 24-hour deal.
{253733}{253774}No two ways about it.
{253810}{253881}And what most people|don't see...
{253930}{254018}is just how hard it is|to do the right thing.
{254094}{254144}People think if l make|a judgment call...
{254145}{254217}that's a judgment on them,|but that is not what l do.
{254264}{254320}And that's not|what should be done.
{254366}{254434}l have to take everything...
{254435}{254484}and play it as it lays.
{254594}{254641}Sometimes people|need a little help.
{254642}{254707}l got a buddy who's|supposed to be real good...
{254708}{254744}at corrective oral surgery.
{254856}{254928}Sometimes people|need to be forgiven.
{255085}{255150}And sometimes|they need to go to jail.
{255181}{255254}Call me about that. guy|with the teeth, OK?
{255279}{255359}And that is a very|tricky thing on my part...
{255393}{255433}making that call.
{255532}{255608}l mean,the law is the law.
{255609}{255668}And heck if I'm gonna break it.
{255852}{255898}You can forgive someone.
{256075}{256113}Well,that's the tough part.
{256266}{256310}What can we forgive?
{256588}{256629}Tough part of the job.
{256722}{256778}Tough part of walking|down the street.
{258159}{258207}l just wanted to come here...
{258244}{258301}to come here|and say something...
{258301}{258375}say something important,|something that you said.
{258411}{258490}You said we should say things|and do things.
{258491}{258576}Not lie, not keep things back...
{258577}{258633}these sorts of things|that tear people up.
{258634}{258701}Well, I'm gonna do that.
{258702}{258795}I'm gonna do what you said,|Claudia.
{258796}{258848}l can't let this go.
{258921}{258963}l can't let you go.
{259083}{259115}Now,you...
{259147}{259214}You listen to me now.
{259270}{259314}You're a good person.
{259378}{259451}You're a good|and beautiful person...
{259452}{259513}and l won't let you|walk out on me.
{259566}{259629}And l won't let you|say those things...
{259630}{259723}those things about how stupid|you are and this and that.
{259750}{259794}l won't stand for that.
{259859}{259925}You want to be with me...
{259974}{260050}then you be with me.
{260092}{260120}You see?
