1
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,660
<i>I knocked, I cried
She wouldn't open up</i>

2
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:20,332
<i>So I put my little head
Down on the stone</i>

3
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,361
<i>Head on stone
Feet on the threshold</i>

4
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:49,698
<i>Open up, my love
For the fear of God</i>

5
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,465
You're not afraid
it's too crude, too primitive?

6
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,346
No, why?

7
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,269
Where I come from
every drunk sings like this.

8
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,155
<i>No, no, I won't marry a master</i>

9
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,249
<i>I'll marry someone of my own ilk</i>

10
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,732
<i>I won't go drinking with you
Because I'll only regret it</i>

11
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:30,177
<i>Two hearts, four eyes</i>

12
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,261
<i>Crying all day and all night</i>

13
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:45,984
<i>Dark eyes, you cry because</i>

14
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:51,107
<i>You can't be together</i>

15
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:18,267
<i>Is this a God given love</i>

16
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,811
<i>Or one whispered by the Devil?</i>

17
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,601
This is beautiful.

18
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,570
What language
are they singing in?

19
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,939
Lemko.

20
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,737
Thought so.

21
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,488
Shame.

22
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,497
Why?

23
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,826
That it's not ours.

24
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,751
Mr. Kaczmarek, whether it's ours
or not is none of your business.

25
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:37,189
Young friends!
You may be wondering...

26
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,318
What you're doing here,
in front of this stately home.

27
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,491
Well, this is now your home.

28
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:48,333
Through this door you will enter
a world of music, song and dance.

29
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,710
Music, born in the fields.

30
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,377
The music of your grandparents,
and their grandparents.

31
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:57,752
The music of pain and humiliation.

32
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,470
Of joy too, even if through tears.

33
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:04,971
You may also be wondering, will everyone
be allowed through this door?

34
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,103
And my answer is: absolutely not.

35
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,268
Only the best of the best
will make it.

36
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,397
And then, under the careful
supervision of our tutors,

37
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:19,239
you will step onto our nation's stages,
and the stages of our brotherly nations.

38
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:22,235
So I invite you to join
the fierce and noble struggle

39
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,202
with yourselves
and with each other.

40
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:28,491
No more will the talents
of the People go to waste. Hurrah!

41
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,395
Do we have to be able
to read music?

42
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,355
They want it peasant-style.

43
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,241
And you? What will you sing?

44
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,111
A mountain tune.

45
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,573
And you?

46
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,876
Don't know yet.

47
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,538
How does it go,
this tune of yours?

48
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,844
Nice, I know it.

49
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,269
It would be nice with two voices.

50
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:41,359
<i>I'm over the water
And you're over the water</i>

51
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,030
<i>How are we going
To get together</i>

52
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,461
Thank you.

53
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,089
Excuse me, miss with the fringe...

54
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,880
What else have you got?

55
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,299
- To sing?
- Yes.

56
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:21,069
<i>How many sweet, good girls</i>

57
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:25,157
<i>With pretty names</i>

58
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,865
<i>But only one of them suffers</i>

59
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,910
<i>There's no sleep when you're in love.</i>

60
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,954
- Thank you.
- And the chorus.

61
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:41,086
<i>Heart, you don't care for peace</i>

62
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:46,675
<i>Heart, it's great to be alive</i>

63
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:52,472
<i>Heart, it's so good you're like this</i>

64
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,351
<i>Thank you, Heart, for knowing</i>

65
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,563
<i>How to love like this</i>

66
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,820
- Where did you get that song?
- The movies.

67
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:07,362
A travelling cinema showed
a Russian musical in our village.

68
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,325
That's where it's from.

69
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,867
- And what is it about?
- Love, of course! "Heart."

70
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,657
How's your dancing?

71
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,410
I know the basic moves.
The rest I can learn.

72
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,378
That's wonderful. Thank you.

73
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,754
Thank you.

74
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,506
The other one
had a beautiful, pure voice.

75
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,468
- But this one also has something...
- What?

76
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,967
Energy. Spirit.
She's original.

77
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,220
As you like.

78
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,738
We should get a dozen dancers
together from that bunch.

79
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,697
You see your girl?

80
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,159
Which girl?

81
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,873
The "Heart" one.

82
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,660
She is up to something.

83
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,843
Quite a number.

84
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,550
She's not from the mountains,
but from Tomaszéw. Bit of a con.

85
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,848
- But she sings well.
- And she did time, too.

86
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,220
What?

87
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,598
Apparently she killed her father.

88
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,189
Apparently. And she still has
a suspended sentence.

89
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,736
How do you know?

90
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,700
Kaczmarek checked her out.

91
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,794
Head, Zula...

92
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,785
WE WELCOME TOMORROW.

93
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,830
Now fix it there.

94
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,798
Fuck.

95
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,691
So what's the story with the father?

96
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,274
- Whose father?
- Yours.

97
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,522
What do you mean?

98
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,904
What did you do time for?

99
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:01,574
He mistook me for my mother so I used
a knife to show him the difference.

100
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,951
He didn't die, don't worry.

101
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:15,421
Are you interested in me
because of my talent? Or just in general?

102
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,183
Try this.

103
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,678
Not bad.

104
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,956
Leg higher!

105
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,000
Good.

106
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,935
Beautiful, Mateusz, bravo!

107
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,570
Keep to the tempo!

108
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,031
Look at each other!

109
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:50,291
One two three, one two three,
hook and... turn!

110
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:32,625
<i>Two hearts, four eyes</i>

111
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:42,761
<i>Crying all day and all night</i>

112
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:54,139
<i>Dark eyes, you cry because</i>

113
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:59,941
<i>You cannot be together</i>

114
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:25,504
<i>My mother forbade me</i>

115
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:35,559
<i>From loving this lad</i>

116
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:48,319
<i>A heart would have to be
Made of stone</i>

117
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:52,993
<i>Not to love that boy</i>

118
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,461
I've had enough of this.

119
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,124
Let's go.

120
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,962
- Wait a bit. Let's enjoy this.
- Let them have their fun.

121
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,219
We can have our own.

122
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,977
I have to tell you something.

123
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,519
I never believed
in all this folky stuff.

124
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:09,274
But this... it moved me.
You are a genius.

125
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,944
To take something so...
And make it so beautiful...

126
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,947
Thank you both.

127
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,826
This is the most beautiful
day of my life.

128
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:23,105
In your repertoire you access
priceless treasures

129
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,271
of our People's culture.
This is highly commendable.

130
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:32,031
We want you to become
a living calling card for our Fatherland.

131
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:37,495
But I think it's time to add
something new to your repertoire.

132
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:42,492
About Land Reform,
World Peace and the threats to it.

133
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:47,964
A strong number about
the Leader of the World Proletariat.

134
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:53,128
And we, in turn, will do everything
in our power to show our gratitude.

135
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:59,392
And then, who knows...
Berlin, Prague, Budapest, Moscow.

136
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,594
What do you think?

137
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,063
I would like to express gratitude
on behalf of the whole ensemble

138
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,482
for your appreciation
of our hard work.

139
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,732
But when it comes to our repertoire,
it's based on authentic folk art.

140
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,817
The rural population
doesn't sing about

141
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,820
Land Reform,
Peace and Leaders.

142
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,539
Simply doesn't do it,
so it would be difficult.

143
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,287
I understand.

144
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:30,381
If I may... Kaczmarek Lech,
Administrative Manager.

145
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:34,469
Comrade Bielecka,
I assure you that our nation

146
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:37,589
is not so ignorant,
including its rural elements.

147
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:41,763
Quite the contrary.
And it will sing about those issues.

148
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,395
As long as it is encouraged...

149
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,524
and given direction.

150
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,319
This, I believe, is exactly
what the role of our ensemble should be.

151
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,406
Thank you.

152
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,414
Thank you.

153
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:37,607
<i>...of the wise, beloved by all</i>

154
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:42,787
<i>Wonderful Stalin</i>

155
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:48,459
<i>Most beautiful songs
Of our age are sung</i>

156
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,406
We swear to you, Fatherland...

157
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:32,253
On the testament of the great
patriots and revolutionaries...

158
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,547
Feliks Dzieriyfiski
and Karol Swierczewski...

159
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,671
We're going to Berlin.

160
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,926
To the International
Festival of Youth in December.

161
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,690
Berlin today, Moscow tomorrow,
and then... God knows where.

162
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:03,447
Shouldn't we do something
about Janicka?

163
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,656
- What about her?
- She's too dark.

164
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,915
We need a folk appearance.
A pure Polish, Slav look.

165
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,170
Just look at her eyes.

166
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,847
How do you know about Berlin?

167
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,675
From the Minister.

168
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,314
Maybe I exaggerate.
We could dye her hair.

169
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,672
I'll be with you
till the end of the world.

170
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,678
But I have to tell you something.

171
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,403
I am ratting on you.

172
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,864
What do you mean "ratting"?

173
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,952
I go to Kaczmarek
every week and "confess."

174
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,759
But I never tell anything
that could hurt you.

175
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,715
The worst part is,
he's hitting on me.

176
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,264
What does he want to know?

177
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,480
Things... What you did during the war.
If you listen to Radio Liberty.

178
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,807
If you have dollars.
If you believe in God.

179
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,477
Do you?

180
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,278
I do.

181
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,032
I knew it!
Fuck, I'm an idiot.

182
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,909
What would you do in my place?
I'm on probation.

183
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,455
They wouldn't have let me in otherwise!

184
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,378
Wiktor!

185
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:26,756
Go and fuck yourself, bourgeois wanker!
Whatever!

186
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,966
If I wanted, I could fuck you up
good and proper!

187
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,781
As you all know,
these days Berlin is the front line

188
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:14,323
between the socialist
and the imperialist camp.

189
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:17,993
Between the forces
of Peace and the Revanchists.

190
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:23,164
And on the front line, as is the way
with front lines, anything can happen.

191
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:28,879
So we must stick together, be vigilant
and responsible for one another.

192
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:34,719
And whatever they say,
Germans are still Germans.

193
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:39,928
So here's to the adventure
of a lifetime.

194
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,606
Excuse me.

195
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,057
400 metres means
ten minutes walk from the theatre.

196
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:29,644
This is where the Russian sector ends.
I'll wait here.

197
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:48,413
As you all know,
these days Berlin is the front line

198
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:54,715
You'll be with me.
We'll be together.

199
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,421
I can't speak French, or anything.

200
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:01,467
You'll learn.
You have an ear, you have talent.

201
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,928
You're unique.

202
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:07,098
I don't want to live without you.

203
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,778
Alright then, let's do it.

204
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:50,159
What's the matter with you?
There's a banquet.

205
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,794
The comrades want to meet you.

206
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,539
Let me fix my hair.
I'll be down soon.

207
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,260
You look great by the way.

208
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,388
Get a move on.

209
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:49,886
Poland and German Democratic
Republic are good friends.

210
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:55,975
We have to establish
communist friendship.

211
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,278
We are brothers and sisters.

212
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,403
How's the food?

213
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:11,908
Made here, on the premises.
Our specialty.

214
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,785
Thank you, it's truly excellent.

215
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,870
Fish fresh from the Baltic.

216
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:30,025
- Another one, please.
- Sorry, sir. We have to close now.

217
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:34,318
You could go to "Chez Mariette",
they stay open till one.

218
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,160
But between you and me,

219
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,247
if she hasn't turned up by now
she never will.

220
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,061
How long are you in Paris?

221
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,978
We're leaving tomorrow morning.

222
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:11,905
How is life here?

223
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,950
I get by...

224
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:19,826
arranging and composing.
I play at a club.

225
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:23,117
It's good.

226
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,087
Are you with someone?

227
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:29,956
Yes.

228
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,083
Me too.

229
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:37,055
So are you happy?

230
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:51,482
- I'll walk you to the hotel.
- Better not, you know how it is.

231
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,896
For a bit.

232
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,281
No one will see us.

233
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,915
So can you tell me
why you never came?

234
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:11,835
I felt it wouldn't work.

235
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,128
Not the actual escape...

236
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:21,850
But I wasn't up to it,
wasn't good enough.

237
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,343
Not good enough?

238
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,682
Not as good as you...

239
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,605
and in general.

240
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,439
- You know what I mean.
- I don't.

241
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,945
I know that love is love
and that's that.

242
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:37,778
And I know one thing.
I wouldn't have escaped without you.

243
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,111
That's far enough.

244
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,896
Have you been whoring?

245
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,613
I don't have money for whores.

246
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:06,367
I was with the woman of my life.

247
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,369
That's wonderful.

248
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,827
Let me go to sleep then.

249
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:26,447
Looks good, doesn't it?

250
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,237
Welcome.

251
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,743
- Do you have a ticket?
- Yes.

252
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,617
I'd be very interested
to hear your thoughts.

253
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:39,039
We've got quite a few new numbers,
even one in Yugoslav.

254
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:41,754
A nod to our hosts.

255
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,459
Nice.

256
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,259
It's got more style now, more zing.

257
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,642
It's a pity you had to leave us.
You had talent.

258
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,680
Would you like to sit
in our VIP box?

259
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:57,057
Thank you,
but I have a very good seat.

260
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,520
Well, well...

261
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,526
See you then.

262
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:11,155
<i>Silken thread, Serbian cut</i>

263
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:18,453
<i>A tiny string, a fine thread</i>

264
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,546
<i>I am your, Milan, darling</i>

265
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:33,977
<i>My caresses from the Morava</i>

266
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,732
<i>An embroidered shirt</i>

267
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:44,150
<i>And I am promised to Milan</i>

268
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:51,445
<i>I'm sewing a silken thread from dreams</i>

269
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:29,751
Where are you taking me?

270
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,756
To Moscow.

271
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:36,175
But I'm here legally. I have a visa.

272
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:40,057
I'm a resident in France.
I'm not a Polish citizen anymore!

273
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,430
Yes, we know.

274
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:45,316
Relax, you're not going to Moscow

275
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:51,315
You going to Zagreb
and then Paris or wherever.

276
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,860
The Poles wanted us
to send you to Warsaw,

277
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:58,329
which wouldn't be
good for you, right?

278
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:15,714
- Let me stay just one night.
- The train is waiting.

279
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:20,927
It's about a woman,
the love of my life.

280
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:24,188
So you wanna go back
to Warsaw with her?

281
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,978
Femme fatale, eh?

282
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,813
They say Warsaw
is the Paris of the East.

283
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:38,946
<i>Mother forbade me...</i>

284
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:49,665
<i>From loving the lad...</i>

285
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,180
The piano doesn't sound right here.

286
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,054
Let's drop it and use it
for the actual murder.

287
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:28,646
The strings come in a bit early.
Let's wait until the shadow appears.

288
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,352
Fine.

289
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,434
So you're married?

290
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,345
Yes.

291
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:12,102
I did it for us.

292
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:17,312
But it wasn't a church wedding,
so it doesn't count.

293
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:21,445
- So what's your name now?
- Gangarossa-Lichofi.

294
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:25,286
- Ganga... what?
- Gangarossa, Sicilian name.

295
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,327
The main thing is you're not married.

296
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:32,080
- Or are you?
- Come on...

297
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,502
I've been waiting for you.

298
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,121
<i>Two hearts, four eyes...</i>

299
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:22,630
<i>Crying all day and all night...</i>

300
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:32,219
<i>Dark eyes, you cry</i>

301
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,851
<i>You cannot be together</i>

302
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,720
It's too many "r's" in a row.

303
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:58,972
No.

304
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:10,904
And it doesn't fit the music.

305
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,405
It fits, when you
pronounce it properly.

306
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:20,202
But what does it have
to do with "Hearts"?

307
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,951
It's a free translation.

308
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,791
I wonder who translated it?

309
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,539
Don't tell me it was
that poetess of yours.

310
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:31,918
Yes, so what?

311
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,341
Juliette did it as a favour, for free.

312
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:36,805
I should hope so.

313
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,308
Bit silly if you ask me.

314
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,598
"The Pendulum killed time."

315
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,054
Oh, my God.

316
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:48,943
What a critic!
Juliette is a very well known poet.

317
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:53,106
- They just brought out her anthology.
- I won't be singing that.

318
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,609
- Then there will be no record.
- Then there won't be.

319
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:34,071
Be nice to Michel, he can be helpful.

320
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:38,072
We like each other
and he'll like you even more.

321
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,869
- Why?
- Because you're charming.

322
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,197
You've got
"charme slave" as they say.

323
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:45,074
But go easy on the make up.

324
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:47,748
- Why?
- You look good already.

325
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,212
Be yourself, relax.

326
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,428
- Tie or no tie?
- Tie.

327
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:13,565
- Who are the guests?
- Various interesting people.

328
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:16,564
- Your famous poetess as well?
- Probably yes.

329
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,149
She's no threat.

330
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:20,822
She's already had two lovers since me.

331
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:23,571
And with Michel, just play it by ear.

332
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:26,824
Good evening.

333
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,585
- Wiktor!
- This is Michel.

334
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:40,633
- How are you?
- This is Michel and this is Zula.

335
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,924
I'm delighted to meet you.

336
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,847
I've heard a lot about you.

337
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,018
Thank you.

338
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:51,975
- How did the film go down?
- Very good. We're pleased.

339
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:55,228
- Which is good news for you too.
- I'm glad.

340
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,901
You converse away, I'll look around.

341
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,941
She's got something.

342
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:29,640
Good evening.

343
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,810
Excuse me.
Good evening.

344
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:35,184
I thought a lot about your lyrics.

345
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,023
Really? What lyrics?

346
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,650
- To my song.
- I see...

347
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,111
"The pendulum has killed time."

348
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:44,075
Nice, but I don't get it.

349
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:46,529
You don't? It's a metaphor.

350
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,367
To mean what?

351
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,747
That time doesn't matter
when you're in love.

352
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:01,218
Do you like it here?

353
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:03,971
Paris? It's fine.

354
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,050
It must have been a shock.

355
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,097
A shock? Why?

356
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:14,481
Cinemas, cafes, restaurants, shops.
As far as I know...

357
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:18,189
Between you and me
my life was better in Poland.

358
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,483
So why did you run away?

359
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:22,072
I didn't run away.

360
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,779
I married an Italian and left legally.

361
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:29,071
Ever been to Palermo?

362
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:30,788
No.

363
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:33,326
That's a shame.

364
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,291
Nice meeting you.

365
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:55,981
Excuse me.

366
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,144
- What the fuck did you tell him?
- What do you mean?

367
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:02,938
That I pretended to
be a village girl...

368
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:05,699
That I ratted on you.
That I killed my father.

369
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:08,952
That I danced
for Stalin at the Kremlin.

370
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,995
- That was a nice touch.
- Really, why?

371
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,950
- I wanted to give you more colour.
- More colour?!

372
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,873
Yes, that's how it works here.

373
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:18,044
How?

374
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,046
I don't know.

375
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,666
Edith Piaf for instance
worked in a brothel

376
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,964
and they love her all
the more for it.

377
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:27,634
A brothel! What the hell
are you doing to me?

378
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:31,429
And Giovanni wasn't a Duke,
he traded in cut glass.

379
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,270
Christ, all right, I won't do it again.
Shall we go home?

380
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,812
I met your lover.

381
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:43,021
Nice.
A pretty back, but...

382
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:46,365
A bit on the old side.
You look good together.

383
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,537
"Métaph0re..."

384
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:58,793
Idiot.

385
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:08,804
What a jerk.

386
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,090
Oh, well...

387
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,521
Don't you worry, Zula.

388
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,308
What will be will be.

389
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:27,481
I love him and that's that.

390
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:32,990
Zula, what's up?

391
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:42,963
What are you doing?

392
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,253
Come in here. I'm a bit sad.

393
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,964
Not now, love, we're off to "Eclipse."

394
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,345
Everyone's leaving.

395
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,509
Ok, give me a moment.

396
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:54,970
In Poland you were a man.
You're different here.

397
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,521
Maybe I just imagined things.

398
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:20,449
But everything is wonderful.
We are in Paris.

399
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:22,789
I love you with all my heart.

400
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:28,504
And don't worry about Michel,
we get on like a house on fire.

401
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,210
I'll take care of everything.

402
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:21,055
<i>Stop!</i>

403
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,426
What?

404
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,977
That's blank.

405
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:29,556
Blank?

406
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:35,771
We have forty minutes left.
Don't blow it, please.

407
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:46,911
Fine. I'll do it right.
You'll get what you want.

408
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:49,750
Me?

409
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:54,335
Everything here is for you.

410
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:59,552
- Believe in yourself.
- I do. It's you I don't believe in.

411
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:04,890
Shall we?

412
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:07,598
Let's go again.

413
01:05:30,677 --> 01:05:32,224
Why so sad?

414
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:36,145
Look.

415
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:37,855
Our first child.

416
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:39,732
A bastard.

417
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,033
What's wrong?

418
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:47,576
Nothing really.

419
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,822
Everything is great.

420
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:54,292
The French know
what they're doing.

421
01:05:54,409 --> 01:05:59,131
And Michel is a real master.
He fucked me six times in one night.

422
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:02,629
Not like a Polish artist in exile.

423
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:09,720
Now we're talking.

424
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:59,816
- What did you do to her?
- I didn't do anything. She left.

425
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,393
For Poland.

426
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,654
Poland?

427
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:39,412
Is this Mazurek?

428
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:42,873
<i>Mazurek, 'm Bmkaczéw.</i>

429
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:45,914
0418.

430
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,169
Zuzanna Lichofi, please.

431
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:53,675
Lichor'1.

432
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:55,969
Zula.

433
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,888
She's just got back.

434
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:06,396
I see.

435
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:09,983
You don't know where she is?

436
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:41,345
Honestly, I don't know
how to help you.

437
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:45,978
You're not French,
and you're not a Pole either.

438
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:49,736
As far as we're concerned,
you don't exist.

439
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:53,861
But between you and me...

440
01:09:54,482 --> 01:09:57,201
Why on earth
would you want to leave this place?

441
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:58,695
I'm Polish.

442
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:02,199
- Please, stop it.
- I am.

443
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:07,830
You ran away. You betrayed us.
You letdown young people who trusted you.

444
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:10,423
You don't love Poland.

445
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:12,675
- I do.
- No, you don't.

446
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:22,685
But there is a solution.

447
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:28,733
If you truly regret your deeds.

448
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:34,902
You have a certain position
in artistic circles here.

449
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:39,865
You know all kinds of emigres.

450
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:49,931
Good day.

451
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:16,461
You look terrible.

452
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,053
How many years?

453
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:28,265
Fifteen.

454
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:34,150
Apparently I'm lucky.

455
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,362
Illegal border crossing
in both directions

456
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:40,190
and it turns out
I spied for the British.

457
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,174
You've got ten minutes.

458
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:22,444
What have we done?

459
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:35,748
I'll wait for you.

460
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,295
Don't.

461
01:13:37,455 --> 01:13:41,085
Find some normal guy.
One who'll put up with you.

462
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:45,838
That sort hasn't been born yet.

463
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,474
I'll get you out of here.

464
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:57,960
It's nice of you to find time.

465
01:14:58,077 --> 01:14:59,624
Don't be sad, Piotrué.

466
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,622
Come, introduce yourself.

467
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,049
That's Piotrué.

468
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:05,881
Hello.

469
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:09,759
He's shy.

470
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:14,347
Do we look alike?

471
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:16,224
A spitting image.

472
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:20,642
So? You're going back to music?

473
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:23,269
Not really.

474
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:29,826
I'm glad we were able to get you
out of there. It wasn't easy.

475
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:33,287
But the deputy minister
is our neighbor and a good friend.

476
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:36,036
Thank you. I'm really grateful.

477
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:44,048
I've listened to your Parisian record.
It's really good.

478
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:46,008
Wonderful arrangements.

479
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:51,263
It would be good to record
it again here. In Polish.

480
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:54,808
Zula could use that.
And so could you.

481
01:15:58,554 --> 01:15:59,976
Here comes Mummy.

482
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:18,119
Love you to bits,
but I need to throw up.

483
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:22,203
Stay for the reception.

484
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:25,039
There will be many interesting people.

485
01:16:26,457 --> 01:16:28,334
Come, it's all right.

486
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:46,898
Get me out of here.

487
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:49,814
That's why I'm here.

488
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,358
I mean for good.

489
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:01,362
Repeat after me.

490
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:07,085
I, Wiktor Warski, take you,
Zuzanna Lichofi, to be my wife

491
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:15,134
And I swear to be with you
always, until death do us part.

492
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:23,681
I, Zuzanna Lichofi, take you,
Wiktor Warski, to be my husband.

493
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:27,263
And I swear to be with you
always until death do us part.

494
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,648
So help us God.

495
01:19:40,734 --> 01:19:42,953
More for you. You're heavier.

496
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,292
Now I'm yours.

497
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:00,967
For ever and ever.

498
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:44,385
Let's go to the other side.

499
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:49,678
The view will be better there.
