1
00:01:39,044 --> 00:01:40,534
What are you doing there, fella?

2
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:45,744
I just cut these.

3
00:01:48,754 --> 00:01:50,051
You better come along with us.

4
00:02:09,941 --> 00:02:11,568
Taking it off here, Boss.

5
00:02:12,277 --> 00:02:13,938
Yeah, take it off, Dragline.

6
00:02:22,287 --> 00:02:24,778
-Wiping it off here, Boss?
-All right, Koko, wipe it off.

7
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,285
Drinking it up here, Boss.

8
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:29,859
All right, drink it up, Gambler.

9
00:03:02,994 --> 00:03:04,621
You eyeballing there, Society?

10
00:03:04,996 --> 00:03:06,327
Checking my yo-yo, Boss.

11
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,841
Drag, new-meat bus.

12
00:03:26,017 --> 00:03:28,508
Bunch. Must be half a dozen new-meat.

13
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:33,650
No more than five, for a cold drink.

14
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:16,397
All right, you men get lined up there.

15
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:19,894
Dogboy, shut them dogs up.

16
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:22,566
They just smell new-meat, s'all, Boss.

17
00:04:29,714 --> 00:04:31,579
What did they bring us today?

18
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:41,419
Gibson, 507 manslaughter.

19
00:04:42,093 --> 00:04:43,720
Good for a two spot.

20
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:46,363
It was an accident.
I've never been in trouble before.

21
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:47,728
You call the Captain, "Captain."

22
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:51,432
Edgar Potter, 302 and resisting arrest.

23
00:04:52,437 --> 00:04:53,597
One year.

24
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:55,804
I was trying to keep in
out of the rain.

25
00:04:57,242 --> 00:04:59,733
Get the wax out of your ears.
You call the Captain, "Captain."

26
00:05:00,946 --> 00:05:02,937
And you call the rest of us "Boss,"
you hear?

27
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:07,448
This man is going to make us
proud of him, Mr. Hunnicutt.

28
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:10,351
Raymond Pratt.

29
00:05:11,256 --> 00:05:12,245
Yes, Captain.

30
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:14,751
Breaking, entering, and assault.

31
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,757
Five spot.

32
00:05:17,362 --> 00:05:18,226
And a seaman.

33
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:21,796
'Spect that should come in real handy
around here, Captain.

34
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:23,399
Maybe.

35
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:25,362
Lucas Jackson.

36
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:26,633
Here, Captain.

37
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:30,468
Maliciously destroying municipal
property while under the influence.

38
00:05:30,775 --> 00:05:32,265
What was that?

39
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,270
Cutting the heads off
parking meters, Captain.

40
00:05:39,985 --> 00:05:41,612
We ain't never had
one of them before.

41
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:43,381
Where do you think that's
going to get you?

42
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:45,986
I guess you could say
I wasn't thinking, Captain.

43
00:05:48,994 --> 00:05:51,485
It says here that you did
real good in the war.

44
00:05:51,796 --> 00:05:54,788
A Silver Star, Bronze Star,
couple of Purple Hearts...

45
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:58,795
...Sergeant. Then came out
the same way you went in.

46
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:00,998
Buck Private.

47
00:06:01,806 --> 00:06:04,206
Like I was just passing time,
Captain.

48
00:06:05,677 --> 00:06:08,805
Well, you got yourself
some time now...two years.

49
00:06:10,682 --> 00:06:12,013
Well, hell, that ain't much.

50
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:14,677
We got a couple of men here
doing 20 spots.

51
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,181
We got one that's got all of it.

52
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:21,523
We got all kinds, and you're
going to fit in real good.

53
00:06:22,193 --> 00:06:25,026
Of course, in case you get
rabbit in your blood...

54
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,323
...and you decide to take off for home,
you get a bonus of some time...

55
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:32,833
...and a set of leg chains to keep
you slowed down just a little bit.

56
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:36,830
For your own good,
you'll learn the rules.

57
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:40,834
It's all up to you.

58
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:46,711
Now I can be a good guy or I can
be one real mean son of a bitch.

59
00:06:51,856 --> 00:06:54,347
It's all up to you.

60
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,622
All right, let's move it.

61
00:07:14,446 --> 00:07:15,470
One at a time. Move it!

62
00:07:27,892 --> 00:07:29,416
Them clothes got
laundry numbers on them.

63
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:31,826
You remember your number and always
wear the ones that has your number.

64
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:34,091
Any man forgets his number
spends a night in the box.

65
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,492
These here spoons
you keep with you.

66
00:07:36,701 --> 00:07:38,896
Any man loses his spoon
spends a night in the box.

67
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,261
There's no playing grab-ass
or fighting in the building.

68
00:07:41,606 --> 00:07:44,097
You got a grudge against another man,
you fight him Saturday afternoon.

69
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:47,276
Any man playing grab-ass or fighting in
the building spends a night in the box.

70
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:50,907
First bell's at five minutes of eight
when you will get in your bunk.

71
00:07:51,282 --> 00:07:52,408
Last bell is at eight.

72
00:07:52,684 --> 00:07:55,414
Any man not in his bunk at eight
spends the night in the box.

73
00:07:55,787 --> 00:07:57,687
There is no smoking in the prone
position in bed.

74
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:00,417
To smoke you must have both legs
over the side of your bunk.

75
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:02,885
Any man caught smoking
prone in bed...

76
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:04,121
...spends a night in the box.

77
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:05,618
You get two sheets.

78
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,864
Every Saturday, you put
the clean sheet on the top...

79
00:08:07,932 --> 00:08:09,297
...the top sheet on the bottom...

80
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:11,298
...the bottom sheet you turn in
to the laundry boy.

81
00:08:11,636 --> 00:08:13,797
Any man turns in the wrong sheet
spends a night in the box.

82
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:16,130
No one'll sit in the bunks
with dirty pants on.

83
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:19,433
Any man with dirty pants on sitting
on the bunks spends a night in the box.

84
00:08:19,944 --> 00:08:22,640
Any man don't bring back his empty
pop bottle spends a night in the box.

85
00:08:22,947 --> 00:08:25,438
Any man loud talking
spends a night in the box.

86
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:28,444
You got questions, you come to me.

87
00:08:29,454 --> 00:08:32,821
I'm Carr, the floor walker.
I'm responsible for order in here.

88
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:35,319
Any man don't keep order
spends a night in...

89
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,649
...the box.

90
00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:40,456
I hope you ain't going
to be a hard case.

91
00:08:51,176 --> 00:08:53,406
Ain't but four. What did I tell you?
You owe me a cold drink.

92
00:08:53,478 --> 00:08:54,467
I owe you. I owe you.

93
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:03,847
Hey, any of you guys from Connecticut?

94
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:06,924
Forget it.

95
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:08,782
Wash them up!

96
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:11,628
Wash them up!

97
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:24,364
Well, what are you still doing here?
Get at them beans!

98
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:42,955
Next time you stay out of my place.

99
00:09:43,128 --> 00:09:45,028
You try that again
and I'll bounce you off the floor.

100
00:09:45,363 --> 00:09:47,354
Well, man, I didn't know
it was your special seat.

101
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:49,189
You don't take another man's seat, man.

102
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:51,126
It wasn't his fault.
Nobody said anything...

103
00:09:51,202 --> 00:09:54,535
You better mind you manners, boy.
You're acting like a hillbilly tramp.

104
00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:56,667
"Tramp." There you go, Beauty.

105
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:59,369
Hey, yeah, man, you got
your bull-gang name now.

106
00:10:00,044 --> 00:10:02,205
Yeah, well, it ain't no worse
than some I been called.

107
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:04,178
When I was in the Navy...

108
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:05,238
All you new-meats...

109
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,178
...you're going to have to shape up
fast and hard for this gang.

110
00:10:08,253 --> 00:10:09,550
We got rules here.

111
00:10:09,654 --> 00:10:10,552
In order to learn them...

112
00:10:10,622 --> 00:10:12,988
...you gotta do more work
with your ears than your mouth.

113
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,549
Somebody say something?

114
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:19,390
No, I didn't say nothing, Boss.

115
00:10:20,331 --> 00:10:21,320
What have we got there?

116
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,231
Got a Lucas Jackson.

117
00:10:24,903 --> 00:10:27,235
You don't have a name here
until Dragline gives you one.

118
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:32,699
Maybe we ought to call it No-Ears.
You don't listen much, do you, boy?

119
00:10:32,744 --> 00:10:34,644
I ain't heard that much
worth listening to.

120
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:37,237
A lot of guys laying down
a lot of rules and regulations.

121
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:41,908
New-meat looks like
a poker player, Drag.

122
00:10:43,855 --> 00:10:45,516
Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me none.

123
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,387
I know you've got five dollars
pocket money.

124
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:50,086
That would buy you a whole fistful
of cards. You in or out?

125
00:10:51,262 --> 00:10:52,251
Out.

126
00:11:05,777 --> 00:11:06,766
First bell.

127
00:11:17,288 --> 00:11:18,448
How'd you get that scar?

128
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,779
What scar?

129
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,949
Last bell.

130
00:11:23,294 --> 00:11:24,454
Last bell.

131
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,820
Fifty, Boss.

132
00:11:57,495 --> 00:11:58,655
Right, Carr. Fifty.

133
00:12:10,008 --> 00:12:10,997
Getting up here, Carr.

134
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:37,918
Get out of my eyeballing seat,
you new-meat dummy.

135
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:12,960
I'm a salesman. I used to drive
these roads all the time.

136
00:14:14,298 --> 00:14:16,129
Drag, it's going to be
one hot mother today.

137
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:20,460
Yeah, I reckon the Bear's going
to be walking the road today.

138
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:22,636
Then I'm lucky I got me a broom.

139
00:14:22,974 --> 00:14:27,308
I work on top, real cush job. I would
hate to be down in that ditch today.

140
00:14:27,645 --> 00:14:28,805
We work in a ditch?

141
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:31,470
What's the matter with you?

142
00:14:31,816 --> 00:14:34,979
All your big-time driving around,
you never seen a chain gang before?

143
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:38,645
I ain't used to hard work, neither.
I always tried to avoid it.

144
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:41,148
I ain't exactly crazy about it, myself.

145
00:14:41,993 --> 00:14:44,655
Well, man, it's going to be
one tough day to learn on.

146
00:14:47,498 --> 00:14:49,591
Why don't you give one of these
new-meat a break...

147
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:51,157
...and let him use your broom today?

148
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:54,335
Oh, hell, Society, I ain't
going down in that ditch.

149
00:14:54,672 --> 00:14:57,835
Well, I sure would appreciate it.
I ain't in too good a shape right now.

150
00:14:58,176 --> 00:15:00,838
Hey, Koko,
you really going to sell your job?

151
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:02,669
Well, Drag, I may have to.

152
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:05,842
Maybe that Lucas War Hero
would give you your price.

153
00:15:06,184 --> 00:15:07,674
I'll give you 50 cents.

154
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:11,682
Fifty cents for a sweet job like that?
That's worth at least a buck.

155
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:13,345
I'll make it a dollar.

156
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:14,680
Dollar's a deal.

157
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:21,524
Where'd you get that about war hero?

158
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:23,834
A little birdie told me.

159
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:25,664
Tearing the heads off of...what was it?

160
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,360
Gumball machines?

161
00:15:27,905 --> 00:15:30,396
What kind of thing
is that for a grown man?

162
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,702
You know how it is. Small town.
Not much to do in the evening.

163
00:15:37,715 --> 00:15:39,876
Mostly was just settling an old score.

164
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:59,567
Boss, I made this arrangement
with this man to take his broom.

165
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:06,066
-You don't understand, I made this deal.
-Get moving.

166
00:16:07,245 --> 00:16:08,576
But I made this arrangement.

167
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,914
Get to work.

168
00:16:33,437 --> 00:16:36,895
Better take it easy.
You won't last two hours.

169
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:41,939
Taking it off here, Boss?

170
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,271
Yeah, Dragline, take it off there.

171
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:46,579
-Taking it off here, Boss?
-Take it off.

172
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:49,608
Drinking it up here, Boss?

173
00:17:04,969 --> 00:17:06,300
Man bear-clawed here, Boss!

174
00:17:30,161 --> 00:17:31,185
All right, men.

175
00:17:31,662 --> 00:17:33,152
Let's eat them beans!

176
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,670
Cold drink he don't make it.

177
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:54,443
He won't.

178
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:56,676
Hey, Babalugats, got a bet here.

179
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:24,979
-Boss, drinking it up here.
-Right.

180
00:18:30,621 --> 00:18:31,610
Who's that?

181
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:33,312
That's Godfrey.

182
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,451
The Walking Boss.

183
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:49,799
Don't he ever talk?

184
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:56,239
Think he just said somethin'.

185
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,011
You owe that fella a cold drink.

186
00:19:51,035 --> 00:19:51,865
All right!

187
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:54,769
You, Gibson, step out.

188
00:19:56,373 --> 00:19:58,705
Boss Paul says you wasn't
happy with your job.

189
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:00,703
Says you was complaining.

190
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:04,036
Well, we going to give you
a chance to think about it.

191
00:20:04,548 --> 00:20:05,537
All right.

192
00:20:05,683 --> 00:20:07,048
Let's go.

193
00:20:15,893 --> 00:20:17,224
Get them clothes off.

194
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,909
First bell.

195
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:24,284
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard
road finally got to Mr. Lucas War Hero.

196
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:27,123
I'll be back at it in the morning.
Just need a little nap.

197
00:21:27,464 --> 00:21:29,955
Man, I never thought they'd put him
in the box on his first day.

198
00:21:31,302 --> 00:21:32,792
It was only supposed to be a joke.

199
00:21:34,471 --> 00:21:35,961
There ain't no brooms.

200
00:21:36,307 --> 00:21:38,298
Well, can't expect to learn
everything the first day.

201
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,801
They've taught him
a very valuable lesson.

202
00:21:44,315 --> 00:21:46,306
You guys sure give him
all night to think about it.

203
00:21:47,151 --> 00:21:49,483
We can't help it if he's square.
Huh, Drag?

204
00:21:50,154 --> 00:21:54,488
Of course not. He ain't in the box
because of a joke played on him.

205
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:57,320
He back-sassed a free man.

206
00:21:57,995 --> 00:22:00,657
They got their rules and we
ain't got nothing to do with that.

207
00:22:01,832 --> 00:22:05,165
Probably happen to him sooner or
later anyway, complainer like him.

208
00:22:06,003 --> 00:22:08,836
He's gotta learn the rules,
same as anybody else.

209
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:13,003
Yeah, them poor old bosses need
all the help they can get.

210
00:22:14,345 --> 00:22:15,334
Trying to say something?

211
00:22:21,318 --> 00:22:22,444
Last bell!

212
00:22:23,888 --> 00:22:25,014
Last bell!

213
00:22:26,857 --> 00:22:29,189
One of these days I'm gonna have to
flap me up some dust with it.

214
00:22:29,693 --> 00:22:35,256
-Forty-nine and one in the box, Boss.
-Right, Carr, 49 and one in the box.

215
00:23:07,464 --> 00:23:08,761
Putting them on here, Boss.

216
00:23:11,402 --> 00:23:12,892
You see that, you see that?

217
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,198
I got eyes, don't I?

218
00:23:14,271 --> 00:23:16,967
How am I not going to see someone
that looks like that?

219
00:23:20,911 --> 00:23:22,401
Man, oh, man, look at that.
Look at that!

220
00:23:31,956 --> 00:23:34,117
-Wipin' it off here, Boss.
-Wipe it off.

221
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,697
-Taking them off here, Boss?
-All right.

222
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:47,760
Damn thing's blocking the scenery.

223
00:23:51,442 --> 00:23:54,104
Oh man, I'm dying. I'm dying!

224
00:24:02,219 --> 00:24:03,550
Nice broad.

225
00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:06,878
Great set.

226
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:18,794
Lucille, baby.

227
00:24:28,712 --> 00:24:31,840
Oh man, I'm dying! I'm dying!

228
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:39,653
She ain't got nothing, but...one
safety pin holding that thing on!

229
00:24:41,658 --> 00:24:44,149
Come on, safety pin, pop!

230
00:24:47,364 --> 00:24:48,695
C'mon baby, pop!

231
00:24:51,668 --> 00:24:52,657
Hey, Lord...

232
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:56,503
...whatever I done, don't strike me
blind for another couple of minutes.

233
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:00,499
My Lucille.

234
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:04,840
Your Lucille, boy.
Where did you get that?

235
00:25:05,682 --> 00:25:07,172
That's Lucille, you mother-head.

236
00:25:07,684 --> 00:25:10,847
Anything so innocent,
and built like that...

237
00:25:11,188 --> 00:25:12,849
...just gotta be named Lucille.

238
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:18,052
Rub it, baby. Clean that car.

239
00:25:18,128 --> 00:25:20,119
Rub...rub...

240
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:51,717
She don't know what she's doing.

241
00:25:52,396 --> 00:25:54,728
Oh boy, she knows exactly
what she's doing.

242
00:25:55,065 --> 00:25:57,556
She's driving us crazy,
and loving every minute of it!

243
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:00,901
Shut your mouth about my Lucille.

244
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,930
Shut up, Babalugats.

245
00:26:30,267 --> 00:26:31,700
You leave him alone? He's happy.

246
00:26:31,768 --> 00:26:33,099
Because he's a damn moron!

247
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,221
Oh, man, that little Lucille.

248
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:09,729
She was really a big
lot of little gal, wasn't she?

249
00:28:12,436 --> 00:28:16,429
Did you see how she was just about
popping out of the top of that dress?

250
00:28:17,074 --> 00:28:18,564
Come on, Drag, cut it out.

251
00:28:19,743 --> 00:28:21,233
And down below...

252
00:28:21,945 --> 00:28:24,573
...man, that thing
didn't reach no higher than...

253
00:28:28,585 --> 00:28:31,247
She's liable to catch a cold
running around like that.

254
00:28:32,456 --> 00:28:35,948
It was stretched so tight
across her bottom...

255
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,396
...I do believe I saw
one of those seams bust loose.

256
00:28:41,765 --> 00:28:43,756
And the opening got wider...

257
00:28:44,968 --> 00:28:46,265
...and wider...and wider.

258
00:28:48,772 --> 00:28:49,761
Forget it, man.

259
00:28:52,276 --> 00:28:53,470
What do you mean, forget it?

260
00:28:54,778 --> 00:28:58,612
Stop beating it into the ground.
You ain't doing nobody no good.

261
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:04,118
Okay, new-meat. You get some sleep.

262
00:29:05,489 --> 00:29:07,616
And save your strength,
'cause you're going to need it.

263
00:29:10,494 --> 00:29:11,483
Tomorrow.

264
00:30:44,888 --> 00:30:46,378
Why don't you just stay down, Luke?

265
00:30:46,456 --> 00:30:48,219
He's just going to
knock you down again, buddy.

266
00:30:48,592 --> 00:30:50,219
It's not your fault. He's just too big.

267
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:52,755
Let him hit you in the nose
and get some blood flowing.

268
00:30:52,896 --> 00:30:54,727
Maybe the bosses'll stop it
before he kills you.

269
00:30:55,098 --> 00:30:56,395
I don't want to frighten him.

270
00:30:56,867 --> 00:30:57,993
Stay down, Luke.

271
00:31:00,904 --> 00:31:03,896
Stay down, Luke. He's gonna kill you.

272
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,539
Stay down!

273
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:08,160
Somebody ought to stop this thing.

274
00:32:49,713 --> 00:32:50,839
Stay down.

275
00:32:51,515 --> 00:32:52,504
You're beat!

276
00:32:54,518 --> 00:32:56,008
You're going to have to kill me.

277
00:34:07,057 --> 00:34:08,422
All right, pass right. Here we go.

278
00:34:08,592 --> 00:34:13,086
King gets a three, queen deuce,
seven pair of savannah's right here.

279
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:16,422
Deuce gets a four. No hell.
Three gets a big ace.

280
00:34:22,939 --> 00:34:23,928
I call.

281
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:36,677
Kick a buck.

282
00:34:36,753 --> 00:34:38,050
A dollar?

283
00:34:41,124 --> 00:34:43,024
One time.

284
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,018
All right, I'll call.

285
00:34:45,595 --> 00:34:47,790
Hell, if I catch, I'm gonna
burn you out. I call.

286
00:34:48,632 --> 00:34:51,465
King, three, he got a four.
Queen, deuce gets a five.

287
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:53,636
Pair of seven gets a john.

288
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:56,468
And the big ace gets...slop in the face.

289
00:34:58,141 --> 00:35:00,336
Okay, you still do the talking.

290
00:35:01,344 --> 00:35:02,333
Cuter again.

291
00:35:03,046 --> 00:35:04,035
I call.

292
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:08,406
Kick a buck.

293
00:35:11,621 --> 00:35:13,282
-What you got?
-Pair of sevens.

294
00:35:13,356 --> 00:35:16,348
I can see that, mother-head.
What have you got in the hole?

295
00:35:18,662 --> 00:35:20,653
He ain't got nothing showing.
Raze his head off.

296
00:35:21,064 --> 00:35:22,053
He's been betting...

297
00:35:22,265 --> 00:35:24,233
All right, why don't you call him.

298
00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:28,360
You've got to see it, Gambler.

299
00:35:28,672 --> 00:35:30,606
I can't. I can't catch a damn thing...

300
00:35:30,674 --> 00:35:32,665
I'm snake-bit. I fold.

301
00:35:34,377 --> 00:35:37,676
King, four, three. You got a nine.
You got a nine. Nothing visible.

302
00:35:38,381 --> 00:35:40,542
Pair of sevens and a jack gets a six.

303
00:35:41,351 --> 00:35:43,410
Savannahs, you still a better, man.

304
00:35:51,127 --> 00:35:52,116
Kick a buck.

305
00:35:52,529 --> 00:35:54,087
Kick him back a buck!

306
00:35:54,197 --> 00:35:56,529
I'll see your buck and back a buck.

307
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:00,058
Kick a buck.

308
00:36:00,136 --> 00:36:01,068
Damn!

309
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:02,536
Don't look at me, mother-head.

310
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:08,704
What're you going to do, play like
a coconut? You got to call him.

311
00:36:09,913 --> 00:36:12,541
I know he's got a pair of kings.
You don't have to stuff'em up my nose.

312
00:36:12,916 --> 00:36:14,543
Well, you still got to call him, anyway.

313
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,517
The man's got kings. Get your tail out.

314
00:36:22,992 --> 00:36:24,983
You wanna see him? Right there.

315
00:36:31,234 --> 00:36:33,225
Nothing. Handful of nothing.

316
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:36,061
You stupid mullet-head,
he beat you with nothing.

317
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:40,336
Just like today when he kept
coming back at me. With nothing.

318
00:36:44,748 --> 00:36:47,080
Sometimes nothing
can be a real cool hand.

319
00:36:51,454 --> 00:36:52,443
Move over.

320
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:55,455
I'm going to sit in here
next to my boy.

321
00:36:57,761 --> 00:36:59,456
Cool Hand Luke.

322
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:25,745
Hey, Loudmouth!

323
00:37:26,689 --> 00:37:29,351
Come on, get up there.
Your mama's waiting for you.

324
00:37:31,795 --> 00:37:33,285
She never leaves me alone!

325
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,995
Be glad you got somebody, kid.

326
00:37:36,299 --> 00:37:38,290
Luke, visitor for you.

327
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,931
-Coming out here, Boss.
-Come out, Luke.

328
00:39:07,557 --> 00:39:08,581
How did you find me?

329
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:11,787
That Helen...

330
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:14,493
...she sent your things along
with a note...

331
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:18,665
...and then John here,
he wrote to the police.

332
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,671
Goin' around here, Boss?

333
00:39:30,013 --> 00:39:31,674
Well, Arletta, I've got to stay here.

334
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:38,351
I always hoped to see you well-fixed...

335
00:39:39,522 --> 00:39:43,185
...have me a crop of grandkids
to fuss around with.

336
00:39:44,694 --> 00:39:46,821
I'd like to oblige you, Arletta, but...

337
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:49,362
...right off, I just don't know
where to put my hands on 'em.

338
00:39:53,369 --> 00:39:54,700
You know, sometimes...

339
00:39:55,705 --> 00:39:58,367
...I wish people was like dogs, Luke.

340
00:40:01,044 --> 00:40:04,036
Comes a time, a day like when...

341
00:40:05,214 --> 00:40:08,706
...the bitch just don't recognize
the pups no more, so...

342
00:40:11,054 --> 00:40:15,548
...she don't have no hopes,
nor love to give her pain.

343
00:40:18,561 --> 00:40:20,222
She just don't give a damn.

344
00:40:25,401 --> 00:40:26,891
They letting you smoke here?

345
00:40:27,403 --> 00:40:28,734
Smoking it up here, Boss?

346
00:40:37,413 --> 00:40:38,744
You done your best, Arletta.

347
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:44,648
What I've done with myself
is my own problem.

348
00:40:44,754 --> 00:40:48,588
Oh, no, it ain't, Luke.
You ain't alone.

349
00:40:49,258 --> 00:40:51,590
Everywhere you go, I'm with you.

350
00:40:52,762 --> 00:40:54,093
And John, too.

351
00:40:56,766 --> 00:40:58,597
You never thought maybe
that's a heavy load?

352
00:41:01,604 --> 00:41:05,768
Why, we always thought you
were strong enough to carry it.

353
00:41:07,777 --> 00:41:09,108
Was we wrong?

354
00:41:09,445 --> 00:41:10,434
I don't know.

355
00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:14,648
Well, things are just
never the way...

356
00:41:14,717 --> 00:41:16,048
...they seem, Arletta, you know that.

357
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:17,609
A man's gotta go his own way.

358
00:41:18,121 --> 00:41:19,611
Guess, I've just got to...

359
00:41:21,624 --> 00:41:23,455
...got to love you and let go.

360
00:41:26,129 --> 00:41:26,788
I guess.

361
00:41:29,966 --> 00:41:32,457
I ain't asking what you're going to do
when you get out because...

362
00:41:32,802 --> 00:41:35,635
...l'll be dead and it don't matter.

363
00:41:39,976 --> 00:41:41,739
You never did want to live forever.

364
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:43,642
I mean, it wasn't such a hell of a life.

365
00:41:45,314 --> 00:41:48,647
I had me...some high old times.

366
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:50,808
Your old man, Luke...

367
00:41:51,654 --> 00:41:53,815
...he wasn't much good
for sticking around...

368
00:41:54,157 --> 00:41:57,149
...but, dammit, he made me laugh.

369
00:42:00,663 --> 00:42:02,995
I would have liked to have known him,
the way you talk about him.

370
00:42:14,677 --> 00:42:16,167
He'd have broke you up.

371
00:42:33,696 --> 00:42:35,357
What went wrong?

372
00:42:35,698 --> 00:42:38,030
Nothing. Everything's cool as can be.

373
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:42,531
Arletta, I tried.

374
00:42:43,706 --> 00:42:44,695
I mean to...

375
00:42:46,876 --> 00:42:49,037
...live always free and
above board like you, but...

376
00:42:50,379 --> 00:42:52,711
...I don't know, I just can't seem
to find any elbow room.

377
00:42:58,054 --> 00:43:00,386
You always had good jobs.

378
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:04,382
And that girl in Kentucky.

379
00:43:04,727 --> 00:43:07,890
Oh...l'd taken a shine to her.

380
00:43:08,397 --> 00:43:12,060
She sure took off
with that convertible fella.

381
00:43:12,401 --> 00:43:13,732
Well, why not?

382
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:18,904
Idea of marrying got you all,
all bollixed up.

383
00:43:21,077 --> 00:43:23,238
Trying to be respectable.

384
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,913
You was boring the hell
out of all of us.

385
00:43:38,261 --> 00:43:39,922
I'm leaving the place to John.

386
00:43:40,263 --> 00:43:41,252
That's good. He earned it.

387
00:43:42,265 --> 00:43:43,755
Ain't nothing to do with it.

388
00:43:47,603 --> 00:43:49,434
I just never gave John...

389
00:43:51,607 --> 00:43:54,440
...the kind of, you know,
feeling that I gave you.

390
00:43:54,777 --> 00:43:58,269
So, I'm going to pay him back now.

391
00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:03,341
Don't feel you have to say anything.

392
00:44:06,122 --> 00:44:08,113
The way it is, you see...

393
00:44:13,796 --> 00:44:18,130
...sometimes you just
have a feeling for a child...

394
00:44:20,136 --> 00:44:21,467
...or else you don't.

395
00:44:23,306 --> 00:44:25,297
With John, I just didn't.

396
00:44:31,647 --> 00:44:32,978
I gotta go, Arletta.

397
00:44:35,151 --> 00:44:37,813
Laugh it up, kid.
You, you'll make out.

398
00:44:48,497 --> 00:44:51,830
Uncle Luke, why can't you have chains?

399
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:56,263
John-Boy, let me tell you something.

400
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:59,672
You know them chains ain't medals.
You got them for making mistakes.

401
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:04,307
And you make a bad enough mistake,
then you've got to deal with the Man.

402
00:45:05,014 --> 00:45:06,845
And he is one rough old boy.

403
00:45:21,597 --> 00:45:23,588
So long, Arletta. Take care.

404
00:45:24,367 --> 00:45:25,698
You know it, kid.

405
00:45:30,373 --> 00:45:32,204
Now there ain't nothing
to come back for.

406
00:45:39,382 --> 00:45:43,716
"Just a closer walk with Thee.

407
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:52,054
"Grant it, Jesus, is my plea.

408
00:45:55,564 --> 00:46:00,228
"Daily walking close to Thee.

409
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:07,072
"Let it be, dear Lord...

410
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:09,571
"...let it be.

411
00:46:12,915 --> 00:46:17,409
"Through the days of
toil that's near...

412
00:46:19,922 --> 00:46:24,586
"...if I fall, dear Lord, who cares?

413
00:46:29,098 --> 00:46:31,589
"Who but Thee...

414
00:46:31,934 --> 00:46:34,596
"...my burden shares?

415
00:46:36,272 --> 00:46:37,933
"None but Thee...

416
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:41,874
"...dear Lord, none but Thee!"

417
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:10,131
This gang's been doing so good...

418
00:47:11,474 --> 00:47:13,965
...the Captain decided
to give you something special.

419
00:47:16,445 --> 00:47:19,778
You've got yourselves
a whole road of tarring to do.

420
00:47:21,984 --> 00:47:23,815
And I want to see you roll it.

421
00:47:29,658 --> 00:47:31,148
Pick up your shovels.

422
00:47:31,827 --> 00:47:33,488
Get with it. Move!

423
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:39,100
We're sure going to be walking
the road today.

424
00:47:39,168 --> 00:47:40,328
What's the deal?

425
00:47:40,503 --> 00:47:44,337
-Man, you think you been working hard?
-This mother's going to break your back.

426
00:48:25,948 --> 00:48:27,779
Let's move! Let's see those shovels!

427
00:48:32,288 --> 00:48:36,622
Going to twist my arm off if it
don't kill me first. Right, Boss?

428
00:48:45,134 --> 00:48:47,295
Hey, buddy, slow down.

429
00:48:48,137 --> 00:48:49,627
That's a long road.

430
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,303
Well, the man wants speed,
let's just give it to him.

431
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:59,971
Cram it in and break it out.
Yeah. Go hard.

432
00:49:01,817 --> 00:49:03,478
What are we racing for?

433
00:49:04,653 --> 00:49:07,144
Wants speed, let's give it to him.

434
00:49:08,324 --> 00:49:10,155
Use that shovel like it was your spoon.

435
00:49:25,508 --> 00:49:27,169
The man, boy, get the man!

436
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:28,670
Moving it up here, Boss.

437
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:10,708
Now you tell me, Rabbit,
what's going on here?

438
00:50:11,554 --> 00:50:14,216
I don't know, Boss.
Think they're all bear-clawed.

439
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:23,891
They don't know whether
to smile, spit or swallow.

440
00:50:24,567 --> 00:50:27,900
Well, they've never seen
a bull gang before.

441
00:51:43,145 --> 00:51:44,476
Where'd the road go?

442
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:48,143
That's it. That's the end of it.

443
00:51:48,817 --> 00:51:50,148
Man, there's still daylight.

444
00:51:50,986 --> 00:51:52,476
About two hours left.

445
00:51:54,323 --> 00:51:55,654
What do we do now?

446
00:51:57,326 --> 00:51:58,315
Nothing.

447
00:51:59,161 --> 00:52:02,494
Oh, Luke, you wild, beautiful thing!

448
00:52:03,666 --> 00:52:05,998
You crazy handful of nothing!

449
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:28,850
"As Carol pressed her lips to him...

450
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:33,689
"...his right hand started a slow
descent down her silken body.

451
00:52:34,697 --> 00:52:38,189
"Desire and fear,
temptation and terror...

452
00:52:38,867 --> 00:52:42,701
"...yearning and horror warred
within her beautiful young body."

453
00:52:45,374 --> 00:52:48,036
Have to close those things,
or we'd drown,

454
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:49,099
but it's suffocating in here.

455
00:52:50,379 --> 00:52:51,710
Talk about drowning.

456
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:54,439
When I was in the navy...

457
00:52:54,516 --> 00:52:57,212
...I was on submarine duty once,
and when you get down there...

458
00:52:57,553 --> 00:53:00,386
Will you tell your story walkin'?
It's too hot.

459
00:53:10,899 --> 00:53:13,060
Did you see my skinny little boy
chow tonight?

460
00:53:13,235 --> 00:53:15,066
He's matching you plate for plate.

461
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:18,734
I wasn't feeling good.
I think I got an ulcer or something.

462
00:53:20,075 --> 00:53:22,737
He had a bigger spoon. Make you
look like yours had a hole in it.

463
00:53:23,412 --> 00:53:24,401
Come on, Clarence.

464
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:27,242
What do you mean, Clarence?
You call me a liar?

465
00:53:27,316 --> 00:53:28,305
No, not a liar.

466
00:53:28,383 --> 00:53:31,910
You just have a common, likeable
tendency toward exaggeration.

467
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:38,253
That there's the champion
hog-gutter of this camp.

468
00:53:39,094 --> 00:53:41,255
Well, I've seen him eat
ten chocolate bars...

469
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:44,259
...and seven cold drinks
in 15 minutes.

470
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:49,594
He can eat busted bottles and
rusty nails, any damn thing.

471
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:53,271
If you be so kind to let me cut off
your Yankee head, he'll even eat that.

472
00:53:55,611 --> 00:53:56,942
I can eat 50 eggs.

473
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:03,281
Nobody can eat 50 eggs.

474
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:04,950
You just said he could eat anything.

475
00:54:05,287 --> 00:54:06,276
You ever eat 50 eggs?

476
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:08,453
Nobody ever eat 50 eggs.

477
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:10,452
Hey, Babalugats! We got a bet here.

478
00:54:11,293 --> 00:54:14,285
My boy says he can eat 50 eggs,
he can eat 50 eggs.

479
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:15,394
Yeah, but in how long?

480
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:18,326
In an hour.

481
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:20,458
Well, I believe I'll take part
in that wager.

482
00:54:20,803 --> 00:54:21,963
Two dollars. Right here.

483
00:54:22,304 --> 00:54:23,635
Come on now, let's talk some money.

484
00:54:23,972 --> 00:54:25,803
All right, $20. Anything.

485
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:27,972
The syndicate will cover any bet
you want to make.

486
00:54:28,043 --> 00:54:29,169
Koko, get some paper.

487
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:32,644
Drag, 50 eggs got to weigh
a good six pounds.

488
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:35,973
Man's gut can't hold that.
They'll swell up and bust him open.

489
00:54:36,819 --> 00:54:39,982
All right, get your money up. Now,
Gambler, Dynamite, come on, get it up.

490
00:54:40,322 --> 00:54:42,984
Koko-head's going to take all the money.
Come on, Loudmouth, get it up.

491
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:44,990
Wait just a minute, now.
How's he gonna eat them?

492
00:54:45,194 --> 00:54:47,526
Boiled for 15 minutes.
Eat the whole thing in an hour.

493
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:49,991
One rule. No throwing up.

494
00:54:50,365 --> 00:54:52,856
He throws up, you forfeit everything.

495
00:54:53,168 --> 00:54:55,830
Now when was the last time
you ever saw my boy throw up?

496
00:54:56,171 --> 00:54:58,162
Now shut your mouth
and give your money to Koko.

497
00:55:05,214 --> 00:55:07,546
Why did you have to say 50 for?

498
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:11,013
Why couldn't you say 35 or 39.

499
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,844
It seemed a nice round number.

500
00:55:13,522 --> 00:55:16,184
That's money you're talking about.
What's the matter with you?

501
00:55:17,192 --> 00:55:19,854
Yeah, well, it'll be something to do.

502
00:55:26,435 --> 00:55:27,925
-Ten!
-Ten, right!

503
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:33,731
What did I do?

504
00:55:35,711 --> 00:55:37,872
I stole and I told lies.

505
00:55:40,215 --> 00:55:42,706
But I loved my neighbor. And his wife.

506
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:44,708
He'll never make it.

507
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:51,382
What we've got to do is stretch
that little old belly of yours.

508
00:55:52,895 --> 00:55:55,227
Get all this stuff out of the way.
Them eggs's coming down.

509
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,369
We've got to get it all in fighting
shape, like a barrage balloon.

510
00:56:06,508 --> 00:56:07,736
Ready...

511
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:09,977
...and go!

512
00:56:20,756 --> 00:56:24,248
Hey, Boss, man needs a brown
bomber and a dose of salts.

513
00:56:31,733 --> 00:56:33,360
You can't do that!

514
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:38,638
-I want my money back.
-No money back.

515
00:56:49,785 --> 00:56:52,117
Twenty of those pills still won't
make any difference.

516
00:56:52,454 --> 00:56:54,285
What are you worried about?
He can't do it.

517
00:56:55,757 --> 00:56:57,019
What's he doing?

518
00:57:35,964 --> 00:57:39,127
All right, stand back, you pedestrians.
This ain't no automobile accident.

519
00:57:39,201 --> 00:57:40,225
That's all 50?

520
00:57:40,302 --> 00:57:42,634
Move over, losers.
I got money riding here.

521
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,573
All right, I've got it figured out.

522
00:57:46,641 --> 00:57:49,838
If he eats an egg a minute, he's got
ten minutes left to swallow them.

523
00:57:50,145 --> 00:57:53,137
Hey, I just got five bucks
from a rodeo outfit.

524
00:57:55,484 --> 00:57:57,975
-Hey, you're peeling his eggs.
-That's right, mister.

525
00:57:58,487 --> 00:58:00,478
He peels his eggs himself.
That's understood.

526
00:58:00,822 --> 00:58:03,552
Now you may be just great
at hanging paper around the big city...

527
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:04,649
...and passing bad checks...

528
00:58:04,993 --> 00:58:06,984
...but us country boys
ain't entirely brainless.

529
00:58:07,329 --> 00:58:10,321
When it comes to the law,
nothing is understood.

530
00:58:10,665 --> 00:58:12,496
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

531
00:58:12,834 --> 00:58:15,667
Who made what law
about peeling the eggs?

532
00:58:16,004 --> 00:58:18,837
I'm his trainer. I'm the syndicate
covering all bets.

533
00:58:19,174 --> 00:58:22,007
And I'm his official egg-peeler.
That's the law.

534
00:58:27,182 --> 00:58:29,013
Just wait till the hour starts,
that's all.

535
00:58:29,351 --> 00:58:31,342
I was banking on the fact
he had to peel 'em.

536
00:58:34,189 --> 00:58:35,247
What's going on?

537
00:58:45,033 --> 00:58:46,193
You ready, Champ?

538
00:58:51,907 --> 00:58:53,067
Ready?

539
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:55,970
Go!

540
00:58:59,815 --> 00:59:00,975
Two...

541
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:02,405
...three...

542
00:59:02,551 --> 00:59:04,883
Man, he's going to lose a finger
eating eggs like that.

543
00:59:14,062 --> 00:59:15,324
Twenty-four...

544
00:59:21,103 --> 00:59:22,195
...twenty-five...

545
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:23,259
Slow down a little.

546
00:59:28,076 --> 00:59:29,065
Twenty-six...

547
00:59:33,081 --> 00:59:34,912
Forget it, he's wasting time.

548
00:59:52,934 --> 00:59:53,923
Thirty-two.

549
00:59:59,241 --> 01:00:00,333
Just have 18 more to go...

550
01:00:01,643 --> 01:00:02,575
What's wrong?

551
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:04,441
-I think he's gonna throw up!
-Oh, no.

552
01:00:04,513 --> 01:00:06,413
-That's it. He's finished.
-C'mon Luke!

553
01:00:06,448 --> 01:00:07,608
Eighteen to go.

554
01:00:10,952 --> 01:00:11,611
He's finished.

555
01:00:20,962 --> 01:00:23,954
Just like a ripe watermelon
that's about to bust itself open.

556
01:00:24,299 --> 01:00:26,631
Your boy's done for, Drag.
I'm putting in my last tenner.

557
01:00:26,968 --> 01:00:30,131
-lt don't look good, Drag.
-Man's gut can't hold more than that.

558
01:00:39,981 --> 01:00:42,973
-He's all right, he's all right.
-He's going to make it.

559
01:00:54,229 --> 01:00:57,255
I give you a dollar he don't eat
all 50 eggs, I get two dollars back.

560
01:00:57,666 --> 01:00:59,657
Fixer, you're a sweet old boy.

561
01:01:00,001 --> 01:01:03,334
Better take that dollar and buy yourself
a new spark plug or something.

562
01:01:03,672 --> 01:01:06,163
But as long as you done took a stand...

563
01:01:06,508 --> 01:01:09,500
...why don't you put some money where
your mouth is and not no measly buck!

564
01:01:09,844 --> 01:01:11,175
Well, all I got is 3.75, Drag.

565
01:01:11,513 --> 01:01:12,844
That's a bet, Koko.

566
01:01:13,181 --> 01:01:16,207
All right, now the rest of you, I want
to hear from some big-money men.

567
01:01:16,284 --> 01:01:17,683
Where's all the high rollers?

568
01:01:18,019 --> 01:01:22,353
I believe you've got it all, Dragline.
Every cent in the camp is riding.

569
01:01:35,971 --> 01:01:37,962
-What's the time?
-Come on, baby.

570
01:01:38,974 --> 01:01:40,805
Twenty-four minutes to go.

571
01:01:41,209 --> 01:01:45,202
Just let that little old belly sag
and enjoy itself.

572
01:01:58,226 --> 01:01:59,386
Forty-one.

573
01:02:00,228 --> 01:02:04,562
Stay loose, buddy. Just nine more
between you and everlasting glory.

574
01:02:04,899 --> 01:02:07,561
-ls he eating them, Alibi?
-He's chewing. Look at that.

575
01:02:08,703 --> 01:02:11,570
They're pigeon eggs, that's all.
Fish eggs, practically.

576
01:02:11,906 --> 01:02:13,066
How much more time, Carr?

577
01:02:13,408 --> 01:02:14,568
Six minutes to go, Stevie.

578
01:02:16,144 --> 01:02:17,873
Chew, chew, chew!

579
01:02:17,946 --> 01:02:19,106
You're helpin' him chew now!

580
01:02:19,147 --> 01:02:19,806
Oh, no.

581
01:02:22,751 --> 01:02:23,740
Forty-two.

582
01:02:26,288 --> 01:02:28,153
Tiny, tiny egg.

583
01:02:34,262 --> 01:02:35,752
Two minutes to time!

584
01:02:44,306 --> 01:02:45,295
Forty-four.

585
01:02:45,607 --> 01:02:48,770
All right, now, get mad
at them damned eggs.

586
01:02:49,077 --> 01:02:50,066
Eat it there, boy.

587
01:02:50,278 --> 01:02:51,210
Chew on it.

588
01:02:51,346 --> 01:02:52,335
Gnaw on it.

589
01:02:58,386 --> 01:02:59,216
Thirty seconds.

590
01:03:00,422 --> 01:03:02,014
You got the last one.

591
01:03:02,223 --> 01:03:04,123
Stuff it down in there. Get it in.

592
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:07,951
That's the last one in there now, baby.
Chew. Chew.

593
01:03:10,832 --> 01:03:12,823
Ten...nine...eight...

594
01:03:13,835 --> 01:03:16,827
...seven...six...five...

595
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:20,034
...four...three...two...

596
01:03:20,842 --> 01:03:23,037
...one...zero!

597
01:03:26,314 --> 01:03:27,975
Hold it! He didn't swallow the last.

598
01:03:28,683 --> 01:03:31,015
You think so? Just take a look here.

599
01:03:31,786 --> 01:03:33,276
Open that mouth.

600
01:03:49,504 --> 01:03:51,495
Nobody can eat 50 eggs.

601
01:04:10,692 --> 01:04:12,557
Snake in the grass here, Boss!

602
01:04:12,627 --> 01:04:14,060
Get it.

603
01:04:14,162 --> 01:04:15,754
Get it!

604
01:04:32,213 --> 01:04:33,077
Hey, Boss.

605
01:04:34,048 --> 01:04:35,777
Forgot your walking stick?

606
01:04:48,062 --> 01:04:49,552
Man, you sure can shoot.

607
01:04:57,906 --> 01:05:00,739
You gone too far when you mess
with the Man With No Eyes.

608
01:05:01,242 --> 01:05:02,766
You'll be out of here in a little bit.

609
01:05:02,844 --> 01:05:04,539
Why don't you take it a little easy?

610
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:27,090
All right, everybody in the trucks.

611
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:38,272
Boy, look at Him go! Bam! Bam!

612
01:05:38,947 --> 01:05:42,940
Just knock it off, Luke!
You can't talk about Him that way.

613
01:05:43,618 --> 01:05:45,848
You still believe in that big
bearded Boss up there?

614
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:46,944
You think He's watching us?

615
01:05:47,288 --> 01:05:48,619
Get in here!

616
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:50,457
Ain't you scared?

617
01:05:51,459 --> 01:05:53,120
Ain't you scared of dying?

618
01:05:53,461 --> 01:05:56,123
Dying? Boy, He can have this
little life anytime He wants to.

619
01:05:56,464 --> 01:05:58,295
You hear that? You hear it?

620
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:02,463
Come on! You're welcome to it,
Old Timer.

621
01:06:03,304 --> 01:06:05,135
Let me know You're up there.
Come on.

622
01:06:05,473 --> 01:06:08,465
Love me, hate me, kill me, anything.
Just let me know it.

623
01:06:13,147 --> 01:06:14,478
Just standing in the rain...

624
01:06:15,817 --> 01:06:16,806
...talking to myself.

625
01:06:22,156 --> 01:06:25,489
Blind Dick is paying back
three and borrowing five.

626
01:06:26,027 --> 01:06:27,153
Next.

627
01:06:27,328 --> 01:06:28,659
You borrowing or paying back?

628
01:06:28,763 --> 01:06:29,593
Borrowing.

629
01:06:30,164 --> 01:06:33,497
Well, Mr. Cool Hand here is
the soft heart in our loan department.

630
01:06:34,636 --> 01:06:35,625
I just need five, Luke.

631
01:06:39,007 --> 01:06:40,838
I knew you could really
eat all them eggs.

632
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:43,500
Yeah, well, I didn't.

633
01:06:46,681 --> 01:06:49,343
That's my darling Luke.
He grins like a baby...

634
01:06:50,351 --> 01:06:51,841
...but he bites like a 'gator.

635
01:06:52,854 --> 01:06:54,344
I believe I still owe you thirty.

636
01:06:54,422 --> 01:06:56,014
I don't suppose you'd care
to take a check?

637
01:07:05,233 --> 01:07:06,200
For you.

638
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,051
His mother's dead.

639
01:08:19,607 --> 01:08:23,099
"I don't care if it rains or freezes...

640
01:08:23,444 --> 01:08:27,278
"...as long as I got my plastic Jesus...

641
01:08:27,615 --> 01:08:32,279
"...sitting on the dashboard of my car.

642
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:40,124
"Comes in colors pink and pleasant.

643
01:08:40,461 --> 01:08:44,124
"Glows in the dark
'cause it's iridescent.

644
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:47,290
"Take it with you...

645
01:08:48,636 --> 01:08:51,628
"...when you travel far.

646
01:08:54,642 --> 01:08:58,476
"Get yourself a sweet Madonna...

647
01:08:58,813 --> 01:09:02,476
"...dressed in rhinestone sittin' on...

648
01:09:03,151 --> 01:09:07,315
"...a pedestal of abalone shell.

649
01:09:10,658 --> 01:09:14,492
"Going 90, I ain't scary...

650
01:09:15,163 --> 01:09:18,826
"...'cause I got the Virgin Mary...

651
01:09:19,167 --> 01:09:21,158
"...assuring me...

652
01:09:21,836 --> 01:09:24,669
"...that I won't go to hell.

653
01:09:31,212 --> 01:09:34,045
"Get yourself a sweet Madonna...

654
01:09:34,215 --> 01:09:37,048
"...dressed in rhinestone sittin' on...

655
01:09:37,118 --> 01:09:41,054
"...pedestal of abalone shell.

656
01:09:43,324 --> 01:09:46,157
"Going 90, I ain't scary...

657
01:09:46,761 --> 01:09:50,891
"...'cause I got the Virgin Mary.
assuring me...

658
01:09:51,232 --> 01:09:54,065
"...that I won't go to hell."

659
01:10:14,388 --> 01:10:15,719
Luke, fall out.

660
01:10:25,233 --> 01:10:27,565
When a man's mother dies and...

661
01:10:28,069 --> 01:10:32,062
...he gets to thinkin' about her
funeral and paying respects...

662
01:10:32,907 --> 01:10:36,070
...before he knows it,
his mind ain't right.

663
01:10:37,078 --> 01:10:39,740
He's got rabbit in his blood
and he runs.

664
01:10:41,082 --> 01:10:43,073
We're keeping you
off the road for a while.

665
01:10:50,591 --> 01:10:52,752
I'm going to say a prayer
for your ma, Luke.

666
01:11:33,801 --> 01:11:38,135
Sorry, Luke, I'm just doing my job.
You've got to appreciate that.

667
01:11:40,641 --> 01:11:42,802
Calling it your job
don't make it right, Boss.

668
01:13:04,558 --> 01:13:07,391
Ma's in the ground now,
God rest her soul.

669
01:13:09,063 --> 01:13:10,394
You best forget about it, Luke.

670
01:13:11,899 --> 01:13:15,232
Got a day and a half lay-in.
Tomorrow's a holiday.

671
01:14:07,788 --> 01:14:10,313
-Happy Fourth of July!
-Same to you!

672
01:14:56,003 --> 01:14:59,166
Break it up. Come on,
you've had your fun.

673
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,375
First bell! Move it, Stevie.

674
01:15:08,182 --> 01:15:10,173
What have you got,
another one of them dirty books?

675
01:15:10,518 --> 01:15:14,181
Do yourself a favor. Read this part
that Koko underlined for me.

676
01:15:17,191 --> 01:15:20,524
"She moved her head another inch
while he reached up...

677
01:15:21,529 --> 01:15:24,020
"...and put his left hand on Carol's...

678
01:15:25,032 --> 01:15:26,522
"...as Carol pressed her..."

679
01:15:27,368 --> 01:15:29,359
Oh, I can't stand it!

680
01:15:31,539 --> 01:15:33,871
You're just coming to
the interesting part now.

681
01:15:46,587 --> 01:15:48,919
-I can't hear you.
-"Her trembling body..."

682
01:15:56,897 --> 01:15:59,730
Last bell. Last bell.

683
01:16:02,103 --> 01:16:02,933
Move it.

684
01:16:04,405 --> 01:16:06,066
What's that noise outside?

685
01:16:10,578 --> 01:16:11,567
Man on the fence, Boss!

686
01:16:24,625 --> 01:16:25,614
Wait a minute, damn it!

687
01:16:27,294 --> 01:16:29,125
Come back here! Dammit!

688
01:16:33,934 --> 01:16:37,267
Forty-eight, Boss.
One in the box and one in the bush.

689
01:16:37,938 --> 01:16:41,271
Forty-eight.
One in the box and one in the bush.

690
01:17:04,298 --> 01:17:06,129
Oh, listen to Blue sing!

691
01:17:07,301 --> 01:17:10,634
He's on to him, he says. He's got him.

692
01:17:10,971 --> 01:17:12,802
Hell, that dog's running
around in circles.

693
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:14,300
No, he's on to him.

694
01:17:14,808 --> 01:17:17,470
Captain says for us to wait
till the patrol gets here.

695
01:17:18,312 --> 01:17:20,143
Shoulda waited for me to get him out.

696
01:17:20,214 --> 01:17:21,977
Loose like that he can run him crazy.

697
01:17:22,316 --> 01:17:25,149
Didn't even have enough sense to run
from the road like everybody else.

698
01:17:25,486 --> 01:17:27,818
Oh, I'm beat. This ain't my job nohow.

699
01:18:27,548 --> 01:18:29,345
Your dogs are crazy.

700
01:18:31,051 --> 01:18:32,848
He's smarter than a dog. Let's go!

701
01:21:12,012 --> 01:21:13,206
He made it!

702
01:21:16,016 --> 01:21:17,210
Look, Captain!

703
01:21:18,352 --> 01:21:19,842
Look what he done to Blue.

704
01:21:21,355 --> 01:21:22,344
He's dead.

705
01:21:25,526 --> 01:21:27,517
He run himself plumb to death.

706
01:22:01,895 --> 01:22:04,056
Get in line facing the Captain.

707
01:22:47,808 --> 01:22:51,437
You're going to get used to wearing
them chains after a while, Luke...

708
01:22:51,812 --> 01:22:54,440
...but you never stop
listening to them clinking.

709
01:22:55,949 --> 01:22:59,441
'Cause they're going to remind
you of what I've been saying...

710
01:23:00,621 --> 01:23:01,952
...for your own good.

711
01:23:02,823 --> 01:23:04,814
Wish you'd stop being
so good to me, Captain.

712
01:23:09,463 --> 01:23:11,954
Don't you ever talk that way to me.

713
01:23:13,033 --> 01:23:14,022
Never!

714
01:23:14,101 --> 01:23:15,159
Never!

715
01:23:22,476 --> 01:23:24,967
What we've got here is...

716
01:23:25,979 --> 01:23:28,140
...failure to communicate.

717
01:23:29,483 --> 01:23:32,475
Some men you just can't reach.

718
01:23:33,487 --> 01:23:38,151
So you get what we had here last week.
Which is the way he wants it.

719
01:23:38,859 --> 01:23:40,349
Well, he gets it.

720
01:23:42,996 --> 01:23:46,488
I don't like it any more than you men.

721
01:23:55,542 --> 01:23:57,032
Well, lookie here.

722
01:23:58,879 --> 01:24:00,369
I knew they'd get you.

723
01:24:01,014 --> 01:24:02,777
Them chains and a bonus
of a couple of years...

724
01:24:02,849 --> 01:24:05,682
Your running days are over forever, boy.

725
01:24:06,386 --> 01:24:08,183
Hell, I'd like to see you
try to run again.

726
01:24:09,523 --> 01:24:12,890
You know, you getting so you smell
so bad I can track you myself.

727
01:24:14,895 --> 01:24:18,194
Yeah, well, that ought to be easy
for a genuine son of a bitch.

728
01:24:30,911 --> 01:24:32,344
What happened. How far did you get?

729
01:24:32,412 --> 01:24:33,538
Shut up and let him eat.

730
01:24:34,548 --> 01:24:35,913
About a mile and a half.

731
01:24:39,052 --> 01:24:40,576
This supermarket parking lot.

732
01:24:40,687 --> 01:24:42,245
Found a car with keys in the ignition.

733
01:24:42,923 --> 01:24:46,051
Hit this red light and this police car
slides up alongside.

734
01:24:48,729 --> 01:24:50,060
Then what did you do?

735
01:24:51,231 --> 01:24:52,562
Waited for that light to change.

736
01:24:54,935 --> 01:24:57,426
This cop kept looking over, wondering
what somebody looks like me...

737
01:24:57,738 --> 01:25:00,571
...dressed in state issue, was doin'
driving a shiny new buggy.

738
01:25:03,343 --> 01:25:05,174
So what did you do?

739
01:25:05,579 --> 01:25:08,241
He leaned over and said, "Hey!"

740
01:25:09,249 --> 01:25:11,513
Top flight police work,
that's all there is to it.

741
01:25:11,652 --> 01:25:13,449
Fella's probably a lieutenant by now.

742
01:25:21,094 --> 01:25:23,961
Now, we're just gonna lay low
and build time.

743
01:25:24,097 --> 01:25:26,429
Before you know it,
the heat's going to be off of you.

744
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:29,967
Everything will be right back
where it was. Right, sweet buddy?

745
01:25:43,483 --> 01:25:45,781
I hear tell you don't believe
in no God, Luke.

746
01:25:46,987 --> 01:25:49,717
I was wondering how come a nice,
clean-cut young fellow like you...

747
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:52,485
...gets put on the hard road.

748
01:25:53,493 --> 01:25:54,790
Now I reckon I knows.

749
01:25:56,496 --> 01:25:59,988
I've been on the road gang
almost 22 years.

750
01:26:01,301 --> 01:26:03,633
In all that time, I ain't never
killed a white man...

751
01:26:05,138 --> 01:26:06,799
...but I ain't afraid to because...

752
01:26:07,307 --> 01:26:10,140
Excuse me, Boss, don't mean
to interrupt. Caught short here.

753
01:26:10,677 --> 01:26:12,577
So did I. It's okay.

754
01:26:13,313 --> 01:26:15,645
You just go on out there
behind them trees.

755
01:26:16,316 --> 01:26:18,511
Man's gotta have his privacy sometime.

756
01:26:19,519 --> 01:26:22,010
You just keep shaking that bush
so we know you're there.

757
01:26:22,823 --> 01:26:24,814
Just keep shaking that bush.

758
01:26:53,053 --> 01:26:54,350
Shaking it up here, Boss!

759
01:26:58,558 --> 01:26:59,547
Still shaking it, Boss.

760
01:27:03,864 --> 01:27:05,559
I'm shaking it, Boss.

761
01:27:29,723 --> 01:27:31,213
He's gone. Get the dogs.

762
01:28:30,951 --> 01:28:32,612
What you got them on for?

763
01:28:32,953 --> 01:28:34,113
How do you take your pants off?

764
01:28:36,189 --> 01:28:39,681
Best way is to get rid
of them leg irons...

765
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:41,291
...but you ain't strong enough.

766
01:28:41,628 --> 01:28:42,959
Strong enough for what?

767
01:28:44,965 --> 01:28:46,455
Hell, you couldn't heft an axe.

768
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,630
Can, too.

769
01:28:47,968 --> 01:28:49,799
-I bet you can't.
-Can, too.

770
01:28:51,271 --> 01:28:52,704
Bet you can't.

771
01:28:53,306 --> 01:28:54,967
Well, then, go get it, man.

772
01:29:01,648 --> 01:29:02,808
What's your name, boy?

773
01:29:05,318 --> 01:29:07,479
Aren't you going to take
those stripes off your pants?

774
01:29:09,322 --> 01:29:10,482
You know it, kid.

775
01:29:25,672 --> 01:29:27,503
-You want to see something real funny?
-Yeah?

776
01:29:27,674 --> 01:29:29,835
Well, you go on in there
and you get me...

777
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:32,174
...chili powder and pepper and the like.

778
01:29:52,365 --> 01:29:54,026
You better let me handle that, son.

779
01:30:27,467 --> 01:30:28,798
Here they are.

780
01:30:29,869 --> 01:30:30,665
Thank you, son.

781
01:30:30,737 --> 01:30:32,068
What's the matter with him?

782
01:30:32,739 --> 01:30:33,728
He'll be all right.

783
01:30:40,914 --> 01:30:43,906
Now listen. You're going to
have some fun. You hear that?

784
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:46,309
Well, you remember how them dogs do
when they come through here...

785
01:30:46,386 --> 01:30:48,251
...so you can tell me about it
someday, okay?

786
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:05,821
My wife hasn't written me for a month.

787
01:32:08,668 --> 01:32:09,999
She's probably sick of you.

788
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:19,000
Magazine for you.

789
01:32:23,516 --> 01:32:26,349
Hey, Koko,
who's sending me magazines?

790
01:32:29,355 --> 01:32:30,686
Don't know. It's from Atlanta.

791
01:32:31,024 --> 01:32:32,013
My uncle!

792
01:32:32,859 --> 01:32:35,851
Ain't heard from him in eight years
and now he's sending me magazines!

793
01:32:37,697 --> 01:32:39,358
He must have gone crazy!

794
01:32:44,204 --> 01:32:45,364
Look at that!

795
01:32:45,705 --> 01:32:47,696
-That's Luke?
-Look at that, two of 'em.

796
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:52,200
What's the writing say?

797
01:32:53,046 --> 01:32:54,536
What's that, that writing say?

798
01:32:55,048 --> 01:32:57,039
"Dear Boys: Playing it cool."

799
01:33:05,058 --> 01:33:07,049
They must be six feet tall.

800
01:33:13,566 --> 01:33:14,897
Look at that!

801
01:33:15,235 --> 01:33:17,203
My baby! We're in here
digging and dying...

802
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:19,738
...he's out there living and flying.

803
01:33:47,934 --> 01:33:49,424
Koko, will you stop that?

804
01:33:50,436 --> 01:33:52,097
Why don't you try making me?

805
01:34:03,783 --> 01:34:07,116
-Hey, Drag? Let me see the picture.
-What for?

806
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:09,281
Come on, Drag, let us see the picture.

807
01:34:09,622 --> 01:34:11,681
No, you're just a kid.
What you know about it?

808
01:34:11,758 --> 01:34:13,555
You don't want to see
that dirty picture.

809
01:34:14,294 --> 01:34:16,285
Luke and those broads
and all that booze.

810
01:34:16,896 --> 01:34:18,420
Come on, let me take a look.

811
01:34:18,464 --> 01:34:20,659
It would go to your coconut head.
You're liable to get ideas...

812
01:34:20,733 --> 01:34:22,394
...and pass right out.

813
01:34:23,303 --> 01:34:26,295
Now, what you figure it's worth?
A peek at that there picture?

814
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:28,971
A quick look now. I'm not
talking about no memorizing job.

815
01:34:29,309 --> 01:34:30,469
Cold drink.

816
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:32,801
A coke? One cold drink...

817
01:34:33,146 --> 01:34:36,479
...to feast your starving, fishy,
little eyes on the picture?

818
01:34:36,816 --> 01:34:38,807
A true vision of paradise itself...

819
01:34:39,152 --> 01:34:41,814
...with two of the angels right there
frisking around with my boy?

820
01:34:44,190 --> 01:34:45,521
Okay, it's a deal.

821
01:34:45,992 --> 01:34:47,823
One cold drink, in advance.

822
01:35:02,508 --> 01:35:04,408
One chilly bottle right
in my hot little hand.

823
01:35:04,477 --> 01:35:06,968
That goes for the rest of you
mother-heads, too.

824
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:08,838
Let me see.

825
01:35:09,082 --> 01:35:10,481
Did you pay?

826
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:15,680
Come on in there, Wicker Man.

827
01:35:45,218 --> 01:35:49,211
You run one time,
you got yourself a set o' chains.

828
01:35:49,789 --> 01:35:51,950
You run twice,
you get yourself two sets.

829
01:35:53,393 --> 01:35:55,190
You ain't going to need no third set...

830
01:35:55,261 --> 01:35:57,388
...because you're going to get
your mind right.

831
01:35:58,731 --> 01:36:00,892
And I mean "right."

832
01:36:02,568 --> 01:36:04,559
Take a good look at Luke.

833
01:36:06,906 --> 01:36:07,895
Cool Hand Luke.

834
01:36:17,850 --> 01:36:19,784
Easy, easy! Let him breathe!

835
01:36:22,255 --> 01:36:24,416
Oh my poor baby.
They done you real good.

836
01:36:25,258 --> 01:36:27,089
I don't know if you're going
to have the girls chasing you.

837
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:28,684
I'll get some aspirin.

838
01:36:28,728 --> 01:36:29,854
He should have a doctor.

839
01:36:29,929 --> 01:36:30,725
Ain't you gonna learn?

840
01:36:30,797 --> 01:36:33,493
They ain't gonna let no doctor see
what they done.

841
01:36:33,599 --> 01:36:35,760
Get your razor. We'll clean up
some them cuts on his head.

842
01:36:37,603 --> 01:36:40,265
How you feeling, buddy?
How you feeling?

843
01:36:41,441 --> 01:36:44,103
Somebody ought to give him
something cold to drink.

844
01:36:45,278 --> 01:36:47,769
-That's my baby.
-Now he's going to be all right.

845
01:36:48,614 --> 01:36:51,447
Hey, Luke, look we got the picture
you sent us. Look here.

846
01:36:56,956 --> 01:36:58,617
You really can pick 'em, Luke.

847
01:36:58,958 --> 01:37:01,290
Come on...tell us.
What were they like?

848
01:37:01,627 --> 01:37:03,288
Can't you wait until he stops bleeding?

849
01:37:03,696 --> 01:37:06,221
-Why don't ya go back to your knitting?
-Oh, knock it off, you guys.

850
01:37:06,299 --> 01:37:08,460
Picture's a phoney.
Cost me a week's pay.

851
01:37:08,801 --> 01:37:10,132
What do you mean, a phoney?

852
01:37:10,470 --> 01:37:11,664
What you talking about, man?

853
01:37:11,738 --> 01:37:13,638
We saw them two women
right here in the picture.

854
01:37:14,307 --> 01:37:16,138
Did you have them both at once?
I mean, together?

855
01:37:16,476 --> 01:37:19,809
Picture's a phoney.
I had it made up for you guys.

856
01:37:20,146 --> 01:37:21,636
What do you mean? We saw it all!

857
01:37:22,281 --> 01:37:23,441
You was having a big time, man.

858
01:37:23,549 --> 01:37:24,880
You had it made!

859
01:37:25,151 --> 01:37:27,312
Nothing. Made nothing, had nothing.

860
01:37:27,987 --> 01:37:29,818
Couple of towns, couple of bosses.

861
01:37:30,490 --> 01:37:32,651
I laughed out loud once,
he turned me in.

862
01:37:32,992 --> 01:37:33,981
But I got it here!

863
01:37:34,327 --> 01:37:37,660
Oh, come on! Stop beating it!

864
01:37:38,998 --> 01:37:40,488
Get out there yourself!

865
01:37:42,001 --> 01:37:45,835
Stop feeding off me! Get outa here!

866
01:37:45,972 --> 01:37:47,735
Can't breathe. Give me some air!

867
01:37:54,847 --> 01:37:56,781
Well, he ain't himself,
can't you see that?

868
01:37:56,883 --> 01:37:59,181
He's all beat up. He don't know
what he's sayin'.

869
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:03,250
All right, come on, break it up.

870
01:38:03,389 --> 01:38:04,947
Now, straighten out that bench.

871
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:28,847
You were eyeballing.

872
01:38:28,915 --> 01:38:31,543
Can't get your mind on them weeds
if you're eyeballing.

873
01:38:32,218 --> 01:38:34,880
You don't need reasons to kick me, Boss.

874
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:42,421
First bell. Move it.

875
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:49,231
He'll never make it.

876
01:38:49,569 --> 01:38:50,729
What are you talking about?

877
01:39:02,548 --> 01:39:06,040
That old box will collapse and fall
apart before old Luke calls it quits.

878
01:39:06,385 --> 01:39:08,546
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.

879
01:39:08,888 --> 01:39:10,549
Well, I don't see
no sign of guts in you.

880
01:39:10,890 --> 01:39:13,552
No. No chains, either.

881
01:39:13,893 --> 01:39:16,054
Big deal paperhanger,
passing two bit checks.

882
01:39:16,395 --> 01:39:19,228
You haven't had much luck playing
follow-the-leader, have you?

883
01:39:25,571 --> 01:39:27,562
You want to spend the night
in the box, too?

884
01:39:32,411 --> 01:39:36,404
Well, here's our champion hog-gut.
Hasn't eaten for four days.

885
01:39:36,749 --> 01:39:39,741
You're going to need a little extra.
Got plenty for you.

886
01:39:40,086 --> 01:39:41,212
Now you know the rules.

887
01:39:41,354 --> 01:39:43,584
Got to clean your plate or go back
to the box. Right, Boss?

888
01:39:43,923 --> 01:39:44,912
That's enough, Dogboy.

889
01:39:45,258 --> 01:39:47,249
Oh, man used to free-world food
has got a big appetite.

890
01:39:47,393 --> 01:39:49,759
We're going to stretch that
hog-belly right out?

891
01:41:15,948 --> 01:41:17,939
Well, you made the week, boy.

892
01:41:18,684 --> 01:41:21,676
Now you got a day and a half
to rest up for old Monday.

893
01:41:51,717 --> 01:41:54,208
That ditch is Boss Kean's ditch.

894
01:41:54,887 --> 01:41:57,048
I told him that dirt in it is your dirt.

895
01:41:58,057 --> 01:42:00,048
What's your dirt doing in his ditch?

896
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:02,720
I don't know, Boss.

897
01:42:03,896 --> 01:42:05,727
You better get in there
and get it out, boy.

898
01:42:21,914 --> 01:42:25,406
"We work in the morning
hear the ding-dong ring...

899
01:42:26,252 --> 01:42:29,744
"...go march to the table,
see the same damn thing.

900
01:42:30,423 --> 01:42:34,086
"Well, it's on the table,
a knife, a fork and a pan.

901
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:38,093
"Say anything about it you
get in trouble with the man.

902
01:42:40,766 --> 01:42:44,429
"That Midnight Special.
Shine a light on me.

903
01:42:45,104 --> 01:42:48,938
"Let the Midnight Special shine
your ever-loving light on me.

904
01:42:51,110 --> 01:42:54,443
"If you ever go to Houston,
boy, you better walk right.

905
01:42:54,780 --> 01:42:58,773
"And you better not stagger,
and you better not fight...

906
01:42:59,452 --> 01:43:01,613
"...Because the sheriff
will arrest you."

907
01:43:01,954 --> 01:43:03,615
Luke, what you think you're doing?

908
01:43:06,625 --> 01:43:09,458
Just getting my dirt out of
Boss Kean's ditch, Boss.

909
01:43:09,795 --> 01:43:12,628
I'm damned if you're going
to put your dirt in my yard.

910
01:43:12,965 --> 01:43:14,830
You hear me?

911
01:43:14,900 --> 01:43:16,197
Now let's get it out of here.

912
01:43:59,845 --> 01:44:03,178
I told you to get your dirt out
of Boss Kean's ditch, didn't I?

913
01:44:06,952 --> 01:44:08,112
Yeah, Boss.

914
01:44:08,420 --> 01:44:10,320
Then how come it ain't out?

915
01:44:16,862 --> 01:44:18,693
I don't know, Boss.

916
01:44:19,031 --> 01:44:20,692
You don't know.

917
01:44:44,223 --> 01:44:48,216
"Ain't no grave going
to keep my body down.

918
01:44:50,229 --> 01:44:52,561
"Ain't no grave...

919
01:44:52,898 --> 01:44:55,890
"...going to hold my body down.

920
01:44:58,237 --> 01:45:01,729
"Keep Your mind on me above.

921
01:45:02,575 --> 01:45:06,067
"Keep Your heart full of love.

922
01:45:06,579 --> 01:45:10,071
"Ain't no grave
gonna hold my body down..."

923
01:45:51,290 --> 01:45:53,281
What's all this dirt doing in here?

924
01:46:00,532 --> 01:46:02,523
I don't know...

925
01:46:13,479 --> 01:46:18,143
"When I was a little bitty baby, my
mamma used to rock me in my cradle.

926
01:46:18,484 --> 01:46:21,976
"In them old cotton fields back home."

927
01:46:25,157 --> 01:46:26,488
Don't, Boss.

928
01:46:26,792 --> 01:46:28,157
Get to work.

929
01:46:28,994 --> 01:46:30,825
Don't, Boss. Don't hit me anymore.

930
01:46:34,166 --> 01:46:35,997
For God's sake, don't hit me anymore.

931
01:46:36,835 --> 01:46:40,669
What was that you said?
What was that name you used, Luke?

932
01:46:42,508 --> 01:46:43,497
Oh, God!

933
01:46:46,011 --> 01:46:47,000
Oh, God!

934
01:46:52,518 --> 01:46:55,180
Oh, God, I pray to God
you don't hit me anymore.

935
01:46:58,357 --> 01:47:01,349
I'll do anything you say,
but I can't take anymore.

936
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:06,191
-You got your mind right, Luke?
-Yeah...

937
01:47:07,533 --> 01:47:08,693
...mind right.

938
01:47:12,538 --> 01:47:14,529
Oh, I got it right, Boss.

939
01:47:22,381 --> 01:47:24,042
Suppose you was to backslide on us?

940
01:47:24,383 --> 01:47:26,374
Oh, no, I won't, Boss.

941
01:47:27,219 --> 01:47:29,380
Suppose you was to back-sass?

942
01:47:29,888 --> 01:47:32,220
Oh, no, I won't. I won't.
I got my mind right.

943
01:47:40,733 --> 01:47:42,724
You try to run again,
we're going to kill you.

944
01:47:43,235 --> 01:47:44,725
I won't, I won't, Boss.

945
01:47:51,410 --> 01:47:55,744
Go get cleaned up and get yourself
some sleep. Expect you need it.

946
01:47:58,250 --> 01:47:59,581
Come on, son.

947
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:02,910
Come on up outa there.

948
01:49:06,518 --> 01:49:07,849
I got my mind right.

949
01:49:44,223 --> 01:49:45,383
Where are you?

950
01:49:47,226 --> 01:49:48,716
Where are you now?

951
01:50:35,908 --> 01:50:39,400
-All right. Smoke it up.
-Yes, sir.

952
01:50:41,613 --> 01:50:43,604
Luke, water 'em down.

953
01:50:45,317 --> 01:50:46,409
Yes, Boss.

954
01:51:08,473 --> 01:51:10,464
Luke! Fetch the rifle.

955
01:52:01,026 --> 01:52:02,186
You got him, Boss. You got him.

956
01:52:03,362 --> 01:52:04,693
Go fetch it, Luke.

957
01:52:25,384 --> 01:52:28,217
There he is, Boss.
Deader than hell, but won't let go.

958
01:52:38,730 --> 01:52:40,561
You cut that up for our lunch, Luke.

959
01:52:42,501 --> 01:52:44,332
Yes, Boss Paul.

960
01:53:30,615 --> 01:53:33,106
He took the keys off of Dogboy's truck.

961
01:53:34,119 --> 01:53:35,950
He got the keys here, too.

962
01:53:52,304 --> 01:53:55,467
"I'm shaking it here, Boss.
I'm shaking it."

963
01:54:01,646 --> 01:54:03,307
That's my baby, Luke.

964
01:54:06,818 --> 01:54:09,981
"Don't hit me, Boss.
Only don't hit me.

965
01:54:10,989 --> 01:54:12,650
"I'll do whatever you say."

966
01:54:14,993 --> 01:54:17,553
You are an original,
that's what you are.

967
01:54:17,629 --> 01:54:20,325
Those mullet-heads didn't
even know you were fooling.

968
01:54:22,167 --> 01:54:25,762
Fooling them? You can't fool them
about something like that.

969
01:54:25,837 --> 01:54:26,895
They broke me.

970
01:54:28,340 --> 01:54:31,002
But they didn't get my mind right.
Not with no sticks. No, sir.

971
01:54:32,677 --> 01:54:35,009
All that time you were planning
on running again.

972
01:54:36,348 --> 01:54:38,339
Never planned anything in my life.

973
01:55:04,709 --> 01:55:07,542
That's just a little old farm road.
Clean as a whistle.

974
01:55:07,879 --> 01:55:11,212
I worked it a couple times.
We're home free. Come on.

975
01:55:11,550 --> 01:55:12,710
We ain't going nowhere.

976
01:55:12,818 --> 01:55:14,513
Now, what are you talking about, Luke?

977
01:55:15,053 --> 01:55:17,715
We're going by my house and
we're going to have a big meal.

978
01:55:18,056 --> 01:55:22,390
Then I'm going to show you a couple of
farm girls that really know what fun...

979
01:55:23,728 --> 01:55:25,389
And then we're going
to get Koko out of there.

980
01:55:25,730 --> 01:55:28,392
And then the terrible trio
is gonna be complete again.

981
01:55:28,467 --> 01:55:31,766
Man, this old free world ain't going
to know which ear to stand on.

982
01:55:32,904 --> 01:55:35,896
Yeah, well, you and Koko
can handle it without me.

983
01:55:37,209 --> 01:55:39,200
What's you mean, Luke?

984
01:55:39,578 --> 01:55:41,409
I done enough world-shaking
for a while.

985
01:55:41,746 --> 01:55:44,738
You do the rest of it for me.
Send me a postcard about it.

986
01:55:44,983 --> 01:55:46,541
-But Luke...
-Take it easy, Drag.

987
01:55:47,085 --> 01:55:48,074
Where are you going?

988
01:55:49,087 --> 01:55:50,315
Just on my own.

989
01:55:51,756 --> 01:55:54,418
But what am I going to do
all by myself?

990
01:55:56,928 --> 01:56:00,261
Man, if I hadn't lost my head.
I only had a couple of years to do.

991
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:04,763
But when I saw you tearing down
the road in that truck...

992
01:56:08,106 --> 01:56:09,767
Well, you're right, Luke.

993
01:56:11,109 --> 01:56:12,770
We ought to split up.

994
01:56:13,445 --> 01:56:17,245
And then, and then it will be
safer for the both of us.

995
01:56:22,454 --> 01:56:25,446
Just the same,
you're a good old boy, Luke.

996
01:56:28,793 --> 01:56:30,124
You take care!

997
01:57:27,385 --> 01:57:28,716
Anybody here?

998
01:57:44,402 --> 01:57:46,233
Hey, Old Man. You home tonight?

999
01:57:51,743 --> 01:57:54,735
Can You spare a minute.
It's about time we had a little talk.

1000
01:57:59,250 --> 01:58:01,081
I know I'm a pretty evil fellow...

1001
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:05,253
...killed people in the war
and got drunk...

1002
01:58:06,091 --> 01:58:08,184
...and chewed up
municipal property and the like.

1003
01:58:08,326 --> 01:58:10,294
I know I got no call to ask for much...

1004
01:58:10,428 --> 01:58:13,591
...but even so, You've got to admit You
ain't dealt me no cards in a long time.

1005
01:58:16,434 --> 01:58:19,767
It's beginning to look like You got
things fixed so I can't never win out.

1006
01:58:21,606 --> 01:58:22,766
Inside, outside, all of them...

1007
01:58:24,342 --> 01:58:27,834
...rules and regulations and bosses.

1008
01:58:27,912 --> 01:58:29,743
You made me like I am.

1009
01:58:30,081 --> 01:58:32,276
Now just where am I supposed to fit in?

1010
01:58:35,286 --> 01:58:38,119
Old Man, I gotta tell You.

1011
01:58:39,958 --> 01:58:42,290
I started out pretty strong and fast.

1012
01:58:46,965 --> 01:58:48,626
But it's beginning to get to me.

1013
01:58:51,636 --> 01:58:52,796
When does it end?

1014
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:56,300
What do You got in mind for me?

1015
01:58:57,475 --> 01:58:58,965
What do I do now?

1016
01:59:14,159 --> 01:59:15,649
On my knees, asking.

1017
01:59:28,339 --> 01:59:30,000
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1018
01:59:32,510 --> 01:59:34,501
I guess I'm pretty tough
to deal with?

1019
01:59:36,014 --> 01:59:37,504
A hard case.

1020
01:59:40,852 --> 01:59:42,820
Guess I gotta find my own way.

1021
02:00:07,679 --> 02:00:09,340
Is that Your answer, Old Man?

1022
02:00:11,883 --> 02:00:13,874
I guess You're a hard case, too.

1023
02:00:19,390 --> 02:00:21,381
Luke, you all right?

1024
02:00:23,561 --> 02:00:27,395
They got us, boy. They're out there,
thicker than flies.

1025
02:00:28,066 --> 02:00:30,057
Bosses, dogs, sheriffs...

1026
02:00:30,401 --> 02:00:33,393
...more guns than I've ever seen
in my life. You ain't got a chance.

1027
02:00:33,738 --> 02:00:36,400
They caught up with me
right after we split up.

1028
02:00:36,908 --> 02:00:40,400
And they were aiming to kill you.
But I fixed that.

1029
02:00:41,079 --> 02:00:44,071
I got them to promise
if you give up peaceful...

1030
02:00:44,916 --> 02:00:47,077
...they ain't even going
to whip you this time.

1031
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:51,411
They even going to give us
our same bunks back?

1032
02:00:51,756 --> 02:00:53,587
Sure, why not?

1033
02:00:53,925 --> 02:00:58,089
We only been gone a couple of hours.
They're reasonable men.

1034
02:01:07,438 --> 02:01:09,099
You've got to listen to me.

1035
02:01:10,441 --> 02:01:13,774
All you've got to do is give up...

1036
02:01:14,445 --> 02:01:15,776
...nice and quiet.

1037
02:01:17,115 --> 02:01:18,946
Just play it cool.

1038
02:01:21,953 --> 02:01:23,477
Yeah, like I always do?

1039
02:01:24,055 --> 02:01:25,818
Yeah, just play it...

1040
02:01:54,319 --> 02:01:58,153
"What we got here
is a failure to communicate."

1041
02:02:41,866 --> 02:02:42,855
Go get him.

1042
02:03:20,071 --> 02:03:23,268
You hang on in there, Luke.
You hang on.

1043
02:03:25,410 --> 02:03:28,243
There's going to be some
world-shaking, Luke.

1044
02:03:29,580 --> 02:03:31,571
We're going to send you a postcard.

1045
02:03:33,251 --> 02:03:35,742
You follow me and I'll radio
the emergency clinic to open up.

1046
02:03:36,087 --> 02:03:38,078
I'm taking him to the prison hospital.

1047
02:03:38,289 --> 02:03:40,154
But that's an hour away.
He isn't going to make it.

1048
02:03:40,258 --> 02:03:42,089
Get out of the way. He's ours.

1049
02:04:27,772 --> 02:04:29,865
They took him right down that road.

1050
02:04:30,141 --> 02:04:32,632
-What'd he look like, Drag?
-Yeah, Drag.

1051
02:04:33,144 --> 02:04:34,873
Did he have his eyes open or closed?

1052
02:04:34,979 --> 02:04:37,504
-He was smiling.
-Smiling?!

1053
02:04:39,384 --> 02:04:40,681
That's right. You know...

1054
02:04:42,353 --> 02:04:44,014
...that...Luke smile of his?

1055
02:04:44,822 --> 02:04:46,983
He had it on his face
right to the very end.

1056
02:04:47,492 --> 02:04:48,459
Hell, if they didn't know it 'fore...

1057
02:04:48,526 --> 02:04:51,324
...they could tell right then that they
weren't ever going to beat him.

1058
02:04:53,331 --> 02:04:54,821
That old Luke smile.

1059
02:04:57,201 --> 02:05:00,864
Oh, Luke. He was some boy.

1060
02:05:01,039 --> 02:05:03,098
Cool Hand Luke, hell!

1061
02:05:03,274 --> 02:05:05,435
He's a natural born world-shaker!
