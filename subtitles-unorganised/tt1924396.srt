1
00:00:25,617 --> 00:00:28,734
Pinewood marriage chest
with groove joinery

2
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:32,608
and hand-forged hinges
in the shape of tulip buds.

3
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:36,361
Walnut sideboard.

4
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:38,858
16th-century French decorations

5
00:00:39,035 --> 00:00:41,950
of herms
and griffin-shaped cartouches.

6
00:00:42,118 --> 00:00:45,200
Embellished deplorably
in the 19th century.

7
00:00:47,496 --> 00:00:51,110
A pair of oak veneer cabinets
in the Flemish style.

8
00:00:51,288 --> 00:00:52,946
Upper section with two doors,

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,404
featuring carved anthropomorphic
figures and caryatids.

10
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:04,994
Something wrong, Mr. Oldman?

11
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:26,904
Is it important?

12
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:30,076
If you were kind enough
to let me have this as a gift,

13
00:01:30,252 --> 00:01:32,240
I'd be delighted to accept.

14
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,410
I don't remember that.

15
00:01:34,584 --> 00:01:36,540
It may look like mouldy wood,

16
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,830
but centuries ago,
beneath the mould,

17
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:41,325
there must have been a painting.

18
00:02:33,092 --> 00:02:35,877
- Good evening. How are you?
- Very well.

19
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:43,890
The management
and staff of Styrorex

20
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,679
would like to offer our best wishes,
Mr. Oldman.

21
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,175
Happy birthday, Mr. Oldman.

22
00:03:49,352 --> 00:03:52,185
This year, our chefs wish
to dedicate in your honour

23
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:54,890
an ancient recipe
of a Renaissance dessert

24
00:03:55,062 --> 00:03:57,516
made of choux cream
and bitter almonds.

25
00:04:02,105 --> 00:04:03,301
Enjoy.

26
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:12,186
- Most likely a rash.
- lt must be that.

27
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:32,308
Was it not to your taste,
Mr. Oldman?

28
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:36,098
Quite the contrary, but you see,
my birthday is tomorrow.

29
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:40,483
It is now 10:35pm
and I'm very superstitious.

30
00:04:40,818 --> 00:04:42,274
Pretend I had accepted.

31
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:47,525
The day after tomorrow, then.

32
00:04:50,277 --> 00:04:53,643
The director of the Vatican Museum
wants you to call him back.

33
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:56,521
The reliquary attributed to Cellini,
I presume.

34
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:58,437
The report on this is ready.

35
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:01,315
There's a pile of gifts.
What shall I do with them?

36
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:03,727
Send them to my house
except the mobile.

37
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,942
Only one this year.

38
00:05:06,114 --> 00:05:07,938
Good. Word's out that I hate them.

39
00:05:08,115 --> 00:05:11,562
Unless you've changed your habits,
you'll have to answer that.

40
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:13,776
It's the first call on your birthday.

41
00:05:14,946 --> 00:05:16,108
Tradition.

42
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:20,811
Hello.

43
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:23,277
I have no wish
to waste your time.

44
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,105
- Who's speaking?
- It's me, Claire Ibbetson.

45
00:05:26,282 --> 00:05:27,904
Please don't hang up on me.

46
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:30,857
You're Mr. Oldman's secretary,
aren't you?

47
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:33,602
You can speak to me.
It makes no difference.

48
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,031
You see, I... I don't know anybody.
I'm on my own.

49
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:39,903
I'm sorry, Miss lbbetson,
this is not a helpline.

50
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:42,114
I'm not explaining myself very well.

51
00:05:42,285 --> 00:05:44,854
I'm not in the habit
of speaking to people much.

52
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:47,737
That's a considerable stroke
of good fortune.

53
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:50,612
- Talking to people is perilous.
- I'm desperate...

54
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:53,190
You made the call
so you're running the risk.

55
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,905
It's about the furniture
of my parents' villa.

56
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,111
They... about a year ago.

57
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:01,408
- You see?
- I understand.

58
00:06:01,745 --> 00:06:02,987
An estate of great...

59
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,698
I've always heard it referred to
as being of...

60
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,245
Extremely valuable.

61
00:06:07,414 --> 00:06:10,080
Very rare pieces,
including paintings.

62
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:12,949
Unfortunately,
I have no photographs.

63
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,283
So what?

64
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:17,985
To be honest, I haven't decided yet,
but I would like to have a...

65
00:06:18,163 --> 00:06:20,533
Oh, I'm out of my depth.
What's the word?

66
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:22,743
- Valuation.
- Exactly.

67
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:26,281
That is why I asked
to speak to Mr. Oldman.

68
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:29,574
Does Mr. Oldman have the pleasure
of knowing you?

69
00:06:29,748 --> 00:06:32,451
Oh, no, not at all.
He doesn't know me.

70
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:34,496
But... but I know a lot about him.

71
00:06:35,707 --> 00:06:38,991
Mr. Oldman's assistants
are responsible for assessments.

72
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:42,995
- I'll put you through.
- Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

73
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:45,288
I must speak
to Mr. Oldman in person.

74
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:48,458
Mr. Oldman never presides
over early appraisals.

75
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:50,583
But you see, before he died,

76
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:53,370
Dad told me that
if I decided to sell everything,

77
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:56,542
I should entrust the auction sale
to Mr. Virgil Oldman.

78
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,242
- In his opinion, the best.
- Sold!

79
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,542
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me
great pleasure to present lot 231,

80
00:07:04,878 --> 00:07:09,951
a refracting elongated telescope
constructed by Galileo Galilei.

81
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:12,335
It's still in perfect working order.

82
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:15,076
Can we open bidding,
please, at 1,000,000?

83
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:18,503
- 1,100,000.
- 1,100,000. 1,200,000.

84
00:07:18,797 --> 00:07:22,376
1,300,000.
1,400,000 on the telephone.

85
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:25,339
1,500,000 back in the room.
1,600,000.

86
00:07:25,632 --> 00:07:28,497
1,700,000.
1,800,000 in the room.

87
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:33,042
1,900,000. 2,000,000.
At 2,000,000.

88
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:34,834
Gesundheit. Was that a bid?

89
00:07:35,134 --> 00:07:39,754
At 2,000,000. 2,100,000.

90
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:42,205
2,300,000 on the telephone.

91
00:07:42,507 --> 00:07:45,043
2,500,000. I can sell it. 2,700,000.

92
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:48,673
At 2,700,000.
Any more? Are we all done?

93
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,757
At 2,700,000.

94
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:53,501
Sold. Congratulations, sir.

95
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:55,673
Lot 232.

96
00:07:55,844 --> 00:07:59,705
Disciple of Boris Gregorian, Thurst.
Oil on canvas, 60 x 70.

97
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:01,881
This one will go to the best offer.

98
00:08:03,052 --> 00:08:05,968
1,000. 2,000.

99
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:11,002
3,000. 4,000. 5,000 online.

100
00:08:12,054 --> 00:08:15,301
6,000. 7,000.

101
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:18,962
8,000. 9,000 on the telephone.

102
00:08:19,263 --> 00:08:21,717
10,000 back in the room.
11,000 online.

103
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:25,427
12,000. 13,000 online.
14,000. 15,000.

104
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:28,796
This is not doing my neck any good.

105
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:30,840
At 15,000.

106
00:08:32,932 --> 00:08:35,220
20,000. At 20,000.

107
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:37,048
Any more? Sold!

108
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:55,018
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes. Very.

109
00:09:55,317 --> 00:09:58,067
You never miss a trick,
do you, governor?

110
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:03,602
- Who is it really?
- Yansky.

111
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,357
A Russian painter
who died in the late '30s.

112
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:08,608
An outstanding landscape painter.

113
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:13,564
But among his many landscapes,
he painted three portraits.

114
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:16,437
Only three in his whole life.

115
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:19,111
And this is one of the three.

116
00:10:22,114 --> 00:10:23,820
It's double, alright?

117
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:26,855
How long have
we known each other?

118
00:10:27,155 --> 00:10:28,232
Quite a while.

119
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,978
We've pulled off some sharp tricks
time after time.

120
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:33,774
Remember Milo Hensen?

121
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:37,030
You were the only one who knew
he was going to be big.

122
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:39,733
We got that portrait of his mother
for a song

123
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:43,363
from under the noses
of that bunch of idiots.

124
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:45,032
Must be worth a fortune now.

125
00:10:45,198 --> 00:10:47,603
You almost sound bitter
you didn't get more.

126
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:50,480
Have we ever talked about money,
you and me?

127
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:53,194
- Honestly, no.
- It's been good enough for you.

128
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:55,606
It's been good enough for me,
you misery.

129
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:57,941
What matters is that you're satisfied.

130
00:10:58,243 --> 00:11:01,361
My only regret is never being able
to persuade you

131
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,906
that my paintings are evidence
of a great artistic talent.

132
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:07,775
A love of art
and knowing how to hold a brush

133
00:11:08,077 --> 00:11:09,451
doesn't make an artist.

134
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:12,820
You need an inner mystery.
A knack you've never possessed.

135
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,237
You're right. Double wasn't enough.

136
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:35,679
In my 36 years in this business,

137
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:39,461
never has anyone had the gall
to keep me waiting 40 minutes.

138
00:13:39,638 --> 00:13:42,305
It's a disgrace.
A display of bad manners.

139
00:13:42,472 --> 00:13:44,713
Let me explain.
I tried to call.

140
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,964
- There's no excuse.
- I tried to call.

141
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,929
Never come near me again.

142
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:51,965
Nobody answered and
I don't have your mobile number.

143
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,213
I do not possess a mobile phone.

144
00:14:02,183 --> 00:14:04,672
lt's the lbbetson woman
on the phone.

145
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:07,678
- Tell her to go to hell.
- She's crying.

146
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:09,301
Serves her right.

147
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,631
She was hit by a car
on her way to meet you.

148
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,677
So much the worse for her.
It's no concern of mine.

149
00:14:14,976 --> 00:14:16,386
She was left unconscious.

150
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:19,761
She was lying in a pool of blood
when the ambulance arrived.

151
00:14:21,144 --> 00:14:23,467
Alright. Put her through.

152
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:32,343
- Yes?
- Please forgive me.

153
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:37,054
I had no intention
to be in any way disrespectful.

154
00:14:37,229 --> 00:14:39,184
Nothing too serious, I hope.

155
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:42,721
No. Fortunately,
they'II... they'll let me out tomorrow.

156
00:14:42,897 --> 00:14:46,015
Good.
I hope you make a speedy recovery.

157
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:48,226
Would you consent
to a new appointment?

158
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,306
- Please.
- Alright.

159
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,471
But I'm sending an assistant.

160
00:14:54,648 --> 00:14:57,647
I hope it's the same one
I spoke to last time.

161
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,562
What do you mean?

162
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:04,896
Well, I can't explain it,
but I understood from the outset

163
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:08,562
that voice could only
have been yours, Mr. Oldman.

164
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:11,394
Truly surprising,
wouldn't you say?

165
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:14,352
We think we'll be able
to bring out the whole face,

166
00:15:14,525 --> 00:15:17,609
part of her dress
and the left side of the background.

167
00:15:17,903 --> 00:15:21,102
Incredible. But what made
Mr. Oldman think that?

168
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:24,020
- What period is it from?
- Too soon to say.

169
00:15:24,193 --> 00:15:26,729
Perhaps Mr. Oldman
will be able to work this out

170
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:29,024
more quickly and better than us.

171
00:15:30,945 --> 00:15:33,398
- It's a fake.
- How is that possible?

172
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:35,852
- It's beautiful!
- I didn't say it wasn't.

173
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:37,523
I said it wasn't authentic.

174
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:40,065
From an analysis
of the pigments and wood,

175
00:15:40,362 --> 00:15:42,268
we thought it was pre-17th century.

176
00:15:42,446 --> 00:15:44,982
- Even older.
- Then it must be worth something.

177
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:49,694
It is a work by Valiante,
the female forger of the 16th century.

178
00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:51,315
She copied masterpieces,

179
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:53,943
but couldn't sign them
as she was a woman,

180
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:56,361
so she marked them
with a personal code

181
00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:58,399
hidden in the folds of the drapery

182
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:00,985
or in this case,
in the gaze of the subject.

183
00:16:01,282 --> 00:16:04,399
The beam of light on the iris
is nothing if not a V.

184
00:16:04,575 --> 00:16:06,031
That is Valiante.

185
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:10,774
It is worth something,
but nothing compared to the original.

186
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:35,695
- Are you Mr. Oldman's assistant?
- Yes.

187
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:38,280
I'm Fred, the caretaker.
Pleased to meet you.

188
00:16:40,162 --> 00:16:42,830
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

189
00:16:43,705 --> 00:16:44,735
And Miss lbbetson?

190
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,282
She sends her apologies,

191
00:16:47,455 --> 00:16:50,025
but overnight,
she was running a temperature.

192
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:53,820
She should have called me.
Spared myself a wasted trip.

193
00:16:54,122 --> 00:16:55,828
Well, give her my best wishes.

194
00:16:55,997 --> 00:16:58,665
She asked if you would go ahead
with valuation.

195
00:16:58,832 --> 00:17:00,988
She's instructed me
to show you around.

196
00:17:01,165 --> 00:17:04,744
Everything's at your disposal.
Come with me.

197
00:17:09,248 --> 00:17:11,869
Miss lbbetson was hoping
to meet your boss.

198
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:15,123
It doesn't matter.
Your mistress didn't show up either.

199
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:16,455
Fair enough.

200
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,911
I suppose
it'll get the job done quicker.

201
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,745
Forgive the mess.

202
00:17:27,877 --> 00:17:31,789
It's gone to wrack and ruin ever since
Miss lbbetson's parents died.

203
00:17:33,877 --> 00:17:35,121
Let's go up.

204
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:38,958
How long since the owners died?

205
00:17:39,128 --> 00:17:41,878
By the look of it,
you'd think it was centuries ago,

206
00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:43,669
but it's only been one year.

207
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:47,661
First Mrs. Ibbetson and then,
scarcely 45 days later,

208
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,082
poor Mr. Ibbetson.

209
00:17:49,254 --> 00:17:51,921
You have a good look.
Take your time.

210
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:54,044
Just getting these curtains open.

211
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,456
Too many windows in this room.

212
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,293
Okay.

213
00:18:08,592 --> 00:18:11,459
How many brothers and sisters
does Miss lbbetson have?

214
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,173
None. She is an only child.

215
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,207
- Is she married?
- No.

216
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:18,003
- Has she ever been?
- No, no.

217
00:18:18,174 --> 00:18:20,379
I don't think
she even has a boyfriend.

218
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:23,882
- Grandparents, aunts, uncles?
- No, none at all.

219
00:18:24,176 --> 00:18:26,926
As far as I know,
Miss lbbetson is on her own.

220
00:18:31,052 --> 00:18:32,082
So many rooms.

221
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:35,873
You know, I've never managed
to count them all.

222
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,133
Have there been other valuations
before me?

223
00:18:54,305 --> 00:18:56,841
Absolutely none. Yours is the first.

224
00:18:57,139 --> 00:18:59,972
Miss lbbetson is extremely fond
of this house.

225
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,799
Maybe too fond.

226
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,886
She'd prefer to keep everything,
but what can you do?

227
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,014
The empire crumbles.
A woman on her own can't cope.

228
00:19:09,305 --> 00:19:12,390
Is she thinking of putting
the house up for sale as well?

229
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,177
That, I don't know. Maybe a part of it.

230
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:17,382
She won't get rid of the whole place.

231
00:19:17,683 --> 00:19:19,426
What kind of work does she do?

232
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:23,006
I couldn't say.
I only dealt with her parents.

233
00:19:25,976 --> 00:19:28,263
- May I see the cellars?
- It's this way.

234
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:31,100
It's a long way down.

235
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:37,639
Go ahead.

236
00:20:21,233 --> 00:20:22,429
I honestly don't get it.

237
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:25,815
In the time I've known you,
I've never seen you beaten.

238
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:29,023
I've watched you produce
all manner of gadgets

239
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:31,149
from most unremarkable ironwork.

240
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:34,062
Optical, arithmetical devices,
water clocks...

241
00:20:34,362 --> 00:20:38,650
Even that hairdryer that probably
dried the locks of Jules Verne's wife.

242
00:20:38,944 --> 00:20:42,191
But you've nothing to say
about this curious contraption?

243
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:45,234
I'm surprised that
an art connoisseur like yourself

244
00:20:45,404 --> 00:20:48,233
can get so carried away
by a banal piece of ironwork.

245
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:51,071
It's not the object
that arouses my curiosity,

246
00:20:51,238 --> 00:20:52,612
but it's contradiction.

247
00:20:52,904 --> 00:20:55,855
- Contradiction?
- Look.

248
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:59,444
I found it in this position
in contact with damp flooring,

249
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:03,649
but the rust is all along the top
of the cogs, nowhere near the damp.

250
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:05,059
What does this mean?

251
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,818
The object hadn't been there
for very long.

252
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:11,944
It got rusted in some other place.
Or someone turned it upside down.

253
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:15,446
That's all, nothing more than
a useless exercise in deduction.

254
00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:17,275
Hi. Did you manage it?

255
00:21:17,449 --> 00:21:18,727
Did you ever doubt me?

256
00:21:19,073 --> 00:21:21,609
This works perfectly now.

257
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:25,278
And I transcribed
the recording from the tape.

258
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,488
You're a genius.
How much do I owe you?

259
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,034
Oh, nothing.

260
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:31,074
Maybe you'll invite me out.

261
00:21:31,243 --> 00:21:32,321
Count on it.

262
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,229
- Can I give you a kiss?
- Yes, you can!

263
00:21:35,576 --> 00:21:36,737
That I am good at.

264
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:38,901
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

265
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:42,693
William-Adolphe Bouguereau.
The Birth Of Venus.

266
00:21:45,661 --> 00:21:46,691
Authentic.

267
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:53,775
Umberto Veruda,
The Honest, 1890.

268
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:14,990
You've been
the talk of the town lately.

269
00:22:15,332 --> 00:22:16,989
I hoped to see you
on TV.

270
00:22:17,164 --> 00:22:19,997
I don't like to appear.
I prefer to remain in shadow.

271
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,741
We're much the same that way.

272
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:23,622
That doesn't mean we'll agree.

273
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:25,866
My secretary's been looking for you.

274
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:29,039
How do you know that a painter
will become collectable?

275
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:32,824
Intuition, which also makes
me doubt your intentions.

276
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,041
Sorry for that impression but I've
entrusted you with my belongings.

277
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:38,538
That's not how it works.

278
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,662
There must be a signed contract
before the inventory.

279
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:44,537
It takes time,
and unless you stop fooling around

280
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,413
and decide to come out
it will never get started.

281
00:22:47,586 --> 00:22:49,661
Go ahead with the inventory.

282
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,294
I'll meet you at the villa.

283
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:53,085
We'll reach an agreement.

284
00:22:53,255 --> 00:22:54,663
You have my word.

285
00:22:55,003 --> 00:22:57,077
- Take these.
- Yes.

286
00:22:57,255 --> 00:22:58,333
Be careful!

287
00:22:58,505 --> 00:23:00,624
I'm not sure
but it looks German to me.

288
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,287
Austrian. Careful with that.

289
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,668
It's 11:00
The appointment was 8:30.

290
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:09,500
She's not answering.
She said she'll come. She'll be here.

291
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:12,043
The piano doesn't need restoration.

292
00:23:12,215 --> 00:23:13,245
Quite so.

293
00:23:13,423 --> 00:23:15,461
We have to check it
but there's no key.

294
00:23:15,631 --> 00:23:16,874
But here it is.

295
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:18,919
Last time there was no key.

296
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,169
Looks good.

297
00:23:20,509 --> 00:23:22,333
Mr Oldman!

298
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:24,463
Would you help me
with the bookcase?

299
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,584
Italian bookcase, wood. First half
of...

300
00:23:27,758 --> 00:23:28,787
Who smashed this?

301
00:23:28,965 --> 00:23:31,290
Nobody, Mr Oldman,
it was already broken.

302
00:23:31,466 --> 00:23:33,422
Is this part of the house inhabited?

303
00:23:33,591 --> 00:23:34,789
Why?

304
00:23:34,966 --> 00:23:36,875
There have been some changes.

305
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:38,416
No, no, Mr...

306
00:23:38,594 --> 00:23:40,668
I'm sorry, I'm not sure of your name.

307
00:23:40,844 --> 00:23:42,122
I thought you were...

308
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:43,925
It doesn't matter who I am.

309
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,633
Nobody lives here.

310
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:49,334
Be that as it may, if your mistress
is not here by midday

311
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,344
I will have no option but to
suspend operations.

312
00:23:57,513 --> 00:23:58,591
Mr Oldman!

313
00:24:03,428 --> 00:24:04,543
Miss lbbetson.

314
00:24:04,888 --> 00:24:06,759
Hello, Mr Oldman?

315
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:09,383
Mr Oldman, can you hear me?

316
00:24:09,555 --> 00:24:13,170
Mr Oldman, I apologise.
What must you think of me?

317
00:24:13,347 --> 00:24:16,133
Spare me
the self-serving justifications.

318
00:24:16,307 --> 00:24:17,337
Let me speak.

319
00:24:17,516 --> 00:24:20,881
I cannot touch your things
without a contract. Is that clear?

320
00:24:21,055 --> 00:24:23,924
Would you leave it on the table
in the hallway?

321
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:26,588
I'll sign it.
I accept all your conditions.

322
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:28,473
Yes, but I do not accept yours.

323
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:32,054
I will not do business
with a silly, superficial phantom.

324
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:35,135
Be careful!

325
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,512
I understand your exasperation.

326
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,469
But please believe me
I didn't mean anything by it.

327
00:24:40,642 --> 00:24:44,886
It's been a series of unfortunate,
unintentional mishaps.

328
00:24:45,227 --> 00:24:47,383
So what exactly happened today?

329
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,637
My car was stolen and I had to go
to the police to report it.

330
00:24:52,395 --> 00:24:54,884
Which police station did you go to?

331
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:57,052
The one in the city.
- Whereabouts?

332
00:24:57,396 --> 00:25:00,013
- On the main square.
- Which square?

333
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:02,516
No more interrogation!

334
00:25:02,687 --> 00:25:05,011
No more!
Who do you think you are?

335
00:25:10,148 --> 00:25:11,854
Are you here, Miss lbbetson?

336
00:25:12,023 --> 00:25:14,261
What kind of question is that?

337
00:25:14,438 --> 00:25:15,634
Are you here?

338
00:25:15,812 --> 00:25:18,137
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

339
00:25:18,315 --> 00:25:20,518
- lf you're here, come out now.
- Stop it!

340
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,972
Explain the meaning of this game
which I do not find amusing.

341
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:26,187
Call me tonight. I'll explain.

342
00:25:29,565 --> 00:25:31,474
lt's the same material

343
00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:33,439
and the same workmanship too.

344
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:35,647
These belong to the same system.

345
00:25:35,984 --> 00:25:38,555
There's no signature,
no inscription?

346
00:25:38,901 --> 00:25:44,482
I mean when I've got the rust and
the oxidisation off the other piece.

347
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:46,931
There's nothing.

348
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:52,230
I can do the same with these but, I
mean, right now I can't see anything.

349
00:25:55,986 --> 00:25:57,892
What have you found?

350
00:25:58,236 --> 00:26:01,437
The technique, how the cog
has been attached to it's axis.

351
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:04,184
It's really old.
I've never seen it before.

352
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:06,485
Here, look. Have a look.

353
00:26:14,238 --> 00:26:16,524
It's 18th century.

354
00:26:16,864 --> 00:26:18,854
We could be onto
something big here.

355
00:26:19,032 --> 00:26:20,902
Could you guess what it is?

356
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:25,399
Three pieces of the mosaic
is not enough, Mr Oldman.

357
00:26:27,283 --> 00:26:29,900
In the last few years
the old couple were unwell.

358
00:26:30,073 --> 00:26:32,360
The house was in
a terrible state then.

359
00:26:33,615 --> 00:26:37,148
Mr lbbetson always said
that they'd have to sell something.

360
00:26:37,492 --> 00:26:39,447
And Miss Claire. How old is she?

361
00:26:41,285 --> 00:26:42,907
About 27.

362
00:26:44,286 --> 00:26:46,689
What else can you tell me
about her?

363
00:26:46,867 --> 00:26:48,195
Nothing really.

364
00:26:48,534 --> 00:26:51,781
I've never had much to do with her.
I don't really know her.

365
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:56,278
And yet you've been in the service
of the lbbetsons for about 10 years.

366
00:26:58,536 --> 00:27:01,240
Well, 11 years to be exact.

367
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,528
I don't have much to do with her.

368
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,156
I talk to her often
at all hours but...

369
00:27:06,495 --> 00:27:07,870
But?

370
00:27:08,204 --> 00:27:10,243
I've never seen her.

371
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,118
- How could that be?
- It's the truth. Not once.

372
00:27:14,455 --> 00:27:15,996
Why?

373
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:22,781
Because Miss Claire
suffers from a very strange illness.

374
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:26,823
- Hello.
- Good evening. It's Oldman.

375
00:27:26,997 --> 00:27:28,455
I was expecting your call.

376
00:27:28,623 --> 00:27:32,203
I have no wish to quarrel
and I'm sorry if I was rude today.

377
00:27:32,374 --> 00:27:33,452
It doesn't matter.

378
00:27:33,624 --> 00:27:36,493
But if I confirm I am available,
at the same time

379
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:40,116
I cannot permit this joke in poor taste
to continue any longer.

380
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,077
I wish you to stop
all involvement in my affairs.

381
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,956
I apologise for the trouble.

382
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:47,081
Send me your bill.
Good night.

383
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:57,497
Lot 93. Valiante.
Portrait of a Lady.

384
00:27:57,669 --> 00:27:58,699
16th century,

385
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:02,373
inspired by the Portrait of
a Young Girl by Petrus Christus.

386
00:28:02,544 --> 00:28:03,659
Oil on wood. 30 x 40.

387
00:28:04,004 --> 00:28:06,409
I have here an opening
bid of 20,000.

388
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:09,290
- 22,000.
- 22,000.

389
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:12,413
24,000. 26,000 on the telephone.

390
00:28:12,587 --> 00:28:15,751
28,000 in the room. 30,000.

391
00:28:16,088 --> 00:28:17,877
35,000. Thank you, sir.

392
00:28:18,672 --> 00:28:21,956
40,000 on the telephone.
45,000 in the room.

393
00:28:22,132 --> 00:28:23,458
50,000.

394
00:28:23,797 --> 00:28:28,289
55,000. 60,000.
65,000 on the telephone.

395
00:28:28,631 --> 00:28:31,251
70,000. At 70,000.

396
00:28:31,423 --> 00:28:35,547
Any advance on 70,000? 75,000.

397
00:28:35,882 --> 00:28:37,921
80,000 on the telephone.
Any more?

398
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,963
All done at 80,000.

399
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,958
All done at 80,000.

400
00:28:43,216 --> 00:28:46,003
90,000. Any more?

401
00:28:47,052 --> 00:28:48,295
Sold.

402
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:52,206
- Thank you, sir.
- I bid 90,000 too.

403
00:28:52,552 --> 00:28:55,503
Mr Oldman should have been
aware of that.

404
00:28:55,843 --> 00:28:59,374
I don't believe so, Mrs Derain.
Mr Whistler bid 90,000.

405
00:28:59,718 --> 00:29:03,001
- He was the only one.
- They bid simultaneously.

406
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:05,583
She got her bid in first.
I saw it.

407
00:29:05,928 --> 00:29:07,301
What should we do?

408
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,844
I'm the biggest collector of Valiante
forgeries and I'll sue you!

409
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,758
You were too slow, Billy! You didn't
get in with your bid in time.

410
00:29:16,096 --> 00:29:17,801
And you were too late. Too late.

411
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:20,258
You didn't keep up with me
for God's sake!

412
00:29:20,595 --> 00:29:23,429
She was behind me.
If I'd seen I'd have bid again.

413
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,636
You're losing it!

414
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:26,920
Maybe you're right

415
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:29,716
but it's not the first time
we've messed up.

416
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:33,552
It's the way things go. Never went
into a rage like this before.

417
00:29:35,348 --> 00:29:37,139
That wasn't a Valiante forgery.

418
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:39,927
It was the genuine one
by Petrus Christus.

419
00:29:40,764 --> 00:29:43,220
It'll be worth 8 million.

420
00:29:45,391 --> 00:29:47,051
Woe be me.

421
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:50,640
I'm sorry. Honestly.

422
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:55,306
But even when we lost
Van Gogh's Lady With The Fan

423
00:29:55,476 --> 00:29:57,300
you didn't take it this hard.

424
00:29:58,143 --> 00:29:59,851
What's going on, Virgil?

425
00:30:03,853 --> 00:30:05,725
642.

426
00:30:05,895 --> 00:30:07,435
729.

427
00:30:08,978 --> 00:30:11,347
918.

428
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,758
1,011.

429
00:30:14,102 --> 00:30:17,434
1,119.

430
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:20,095
1,320.

431
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:22,679
1,404.

432
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,226
- What will you have?
- 1,581.

433
00:30:25,396 --> 00:30:26,427
Tea, thank you.

434
00:30:29,939 --> 00:30:31,597
8,109.

435
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,896
8,725.

436
00:30:34,231 --> 00:30:37,313
Sorry, darling, 8,625.

437
00:30:37,483 --> 00:30:40,052
8,725!

438
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,514
8,725.

439
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,728
Take a closer look,
you moron.

440
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:48,147
Shit! You're right, 8,725.
Well done, girl!

441
00:30:48,316 --> 00:30:49,774
That's it?

442
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,234
- Bye!
- Bye!

443
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,229
I gave them a clean
with this special fluid.

444
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,278
And I have studied them
by the millimetre

445
00:31:12,445 --> 00:31:14,731
and look what's come up.

446
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:16,810
Vaucanson.

447
00:31:18,362 --> 00:31:21,064
I can't believe it!
Jacques Vaucanson.

448
00:31:21,238 --> 00:31:23,394
18th century constructor
of automata.

449
00:31:23,738 --> 00:31:26,487
When I was a student
I did my thesis on him.

450
00:31:26,822 --> 00:31:28,647
That's incredible!

451
00:31:28,823 --> 00:31:31,987
One of his most famous androids
even managed to talk.

452
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:35,404
Exactly.
People would pay to ask it questions.

453
00:31:35,573 --> 00:31:40,444
The android would move its head,
bow, and give its reply.

454
00:31:40,825 --> 00:31:42,694
I bet there was someone inside.

455
00:31:42,865 --> 00:31:44,322
You know, a dwarf maybe.

456
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:48,188
Just like Edgar Allan Poe suspected
with Maelzel's Chess Player.

457
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,570
More than likely.

458
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,027
But the mystery
that nobody could explain

459
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,034
was how Vaucanson's
automaton always got it right.

460
00:31:56,409 --> 00:31:59,692
Of course there was trickery
in making the automaton talk.

461
00:32:01,243 --> 00:32:02,902
Everything it said was true.

462
00:32:04,535 --> 00:32:06,278
You bring me all the pieces.

463
00:32:06,451 --> 00:32:10,528
I promise to put them back together
exactly how Vaucanson had them.

464
00:32:10,702 --> 00:32:11,946
I don't doubt it

465
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:15,238
but I fear I've lost my chance
to get the missing pieces.

466
00:32:15,578 --> 00:32:18,198
They must be in the same place
you found these.

467
00:32:18,538 --> 00:32:20,777
And all I need is 80%
of the elements,

468
00:32:20,955 --> 00:32:23,821
and I can work out the rest
and rebuild it myself.

469
00:32:23,996 --> 00:32:25,903
It's not that easy.

470
00:32:27,495 --> 00:32:29,535
I'm sorry. That's my girlfriend.

471
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:33,492
Hey, Sarah, this is Mr Virgil Oldman.

472
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:39,370
Pleased to meet you, Sarah.

473
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:42,573
It's a pleasure. Robert has told me
so much about you.

474
00:32:42,748 --> 00:32:45,747
Don't young people talk about
more exciting things?

475
00:32:46,084 --> 00:32:47,742
Why don't you eat with us?

476
00:32:47,917 --> 00:32:50,287
That's very kind.
Another time, thank you.

477
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:53,119
Alright, we won't insist.
We'll promise.

478
00:32:53,459 --> 00:32:55,165
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

479
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:04,956
Cancel New York and tell
the Alphasons to meet us here.

480
00:33:05,294 --> 00:33:06,951
We called the meeting.

481
00:33:07,335 --> 00:33:10,202
So we've changed our minds.
Is that a problem?

482
00:33:10,544 --> 00:33:11,741
Alright, Mr Oldman.

483
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:18,500
Claire lbbetson phoned.

484
00:33:19,713 --> 00:33:20,991
What does she want now?

485
00:33:21,337 --> 00:33:23,244
She asked you to meet her
at 2:30.

486
00:33:23,588 --> 00:33:25,376
Meet her where?

487
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:27,620
At the lbbetson villa.

488
00:33:27,796 --> 00:33:29,206
Where else?

489
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:29,962
I'm extremely grateful to you
for coming, Mr Oldman.

490
00:34:31,554 --> 00:34:33,677
How did you know it was me?

491
00:34:33,847 --> 00:34:36,051
Fred has a limp. You don't.

492
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:37,762
Ah.

493
00:34:39,347 --> 00:34:42,215
To be honest I didn't expect
you'd want to speak to me.

494
00:34:43,556 --> 00:34:47,219
I know you can't stand my excuses.
If I were you, I wouldn't either.

495
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,670
In fact, your beh...

496
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,009
How should I put it?

497
00:34:50,182 --> 00:34:51,805
Speak frankly. Don't worry.

498
00:34:53,807 --> 00:34:56,093
I won't deny that your whimsical
little ways

499
00:34:56,265 --> 00:34:57,724
are getting a bit tiresome.

500
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:01,350
I hope not too tiresome.

501
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:06,891
But I wanted to say sorry
for... well, my behaviour.

502
00:35:07,934 --> 00:35:11,430
Typical of a "silly, superficial
woman", as you put it.

503
00:35:11,603 --> 00:35:14,349
Why do you systematically
avoid meeting me?

504
00:35:14,518 --> 00:35:16,641
Nothing personal, believe me.

505
00:35:16,812 --> 00:35:19,299
Why would you want to do
business with a person

506
00:35:19,645 --> 00:35:21,636
who arouses such aversion in you

507
00:35:21,812 --> 00:35:24,382
that you can't even look him
in the face?

508
00:35:24,853 --> 00:35:27,805
It's hard to explain. You won't
believe me anyway.

509
00:35:28,145 --> 00:35:32,518
If I didn't believe you, I wouldn't be
here playing hide and seek.

510
00:35:32,689 --> 00:35:34,145
I don't meet many people.

511
00:35:35,396 --> 00:35:37,554
It's been a long time now.

512
00:35:37,731 --> 00:35:40,729
I see nothing serious in that.

513
00:35:40,897 --> 00:35:42,095
Everyone has moments

514
00:35:42,272 --> 00:35:44,974
when they prefer solitude
to the multitudes.

515
00:35:45,147 --> 00:35:47,980
I haven't left this house
since I was 15.

516
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,979
- I don't think I understand.
- You understand perfectly.

517
00:35:52,315 --> 00:35:53,726
This is my room.

518
00:35:53,899 --> 00:35:56,518
If there's somebody in the house
or in the villa,

519
00:35:56,691 --> 00:35:58,729
I lock myself up in here.

520
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,597
I've always done that,
even when my parents were here.

521
00:36:02,775 --> 00:36:04,396
I hardly ever saw them.

522
00:36:04,566 --> 00:36:05,765
I don't see anybody.

523
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:07,812
But why?

524
00:36:07,984 --> 00:36:11,185
Why do you go around with
your hands covered by gloves?

525
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,358
lt's a question of hygiene.
I don't see the connection.

526
00:36:14,527 --> 00:36:16,399
You're afraid to touch others.

527
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,855
To touch their possessions
disgusts you.

528
00:36:19,194 --> 00:36:22,062
I'm afraid of going to places
where others live.

529
00:36:22,235 --> 00:36:25,020
These seem to me
very similar personal choices.

530
00:36:26,195 --> 00:36:29,893
You'd like me to believe you haven't
walked a street in 12 years?

531
00:36:30,237 --> 00:36:31,434
I see you know my age.

532
00:36:31,779 --> 00:36:35,690
Being a hermit and employing
a caretaker doesn't add up.

533
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:39,311
I walk about quite a bit,
if that's what you want to know,

534
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:42,606
inside the villa
when there's nobody here,

535
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:45,732
which is often now,
but I never go out.

536
00:36:46,906 --> 00:36:49,061
The very idea paralyses me.

537
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,778
I hope you understand me now.

538
00:36:54,114 --> 00:36:57,399
I hope that, within the limits
of your work, you'll help me.

539
00:36:58,742 --> 00:37:00,697
You have my word, Miss lbbetson.

540
00:37:00,866 --> 00:37:04,278
As to any agreement between us,
I leave it to you to set your fee.

541
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,729
I trust you blindly.

542
00:37:09,158 --> 00:37:11,031
Leave the contract on the table.

543
00:37:11,366 --> 00:37:13,195
You'll find it signed next time.

544
00:37:13,368 --> 00:37:14,946
Now, please, I'm very tired.

545
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,033
Apart from your fondness
for my gloves,

546
00:37:30,372 --> 00:37:32,408
what made you decide
to call me again?

547
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:33,906
I haven't been kind.

548
00:37:35,037 --> 00:37:38,451
I was taken by the way you
were looking at my house yesterday

549
00:37:38,622 --> 00:37:40,031
from the bar opposite.

550
00:37:43,872 --> 00:37:45,829
You found the missing pieces.

551
00:37:45,998 --> 00:37:49,613
In the meantime
make do with this one.

552
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:51,864
How much would the
automaton be worth

553
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,327
if we manage to make it work?

554
00:37:54,499 --> 00:37:56,405
Think of a really, really high figure.

555
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:01,035
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

556
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:03,454
You've probably pitched it
too low.

557
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:06,541
You're good at talking
without saying anything.

558
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:08,997
I'll take that as a compliment.

559
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:11,947
Should things go
the way I trust they will,

560
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:14,163
you'll be very handsomely rewarded.

561
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:18,447
I didn't mean to talk about money.
It's a real privilege for me.

562
00:38:18,626 --> 00:38:20,203
Where did you find these?

563
00:38:20,544 --> 00:38:23,744
There are very precise rules
in the world of antiques.

564
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,207
It's forbidden to reveal
one's sources.

565
00:38:34,878 --> 00:38:37,794
There's a few more gears
but bigger in that corner.

566
00:38:37,963 --> 00:38:41,495
Gather them together. I'll take
care of the cataloguing myself.

567
00:38:41,671 --> 00:38:42,702
Of course.

568
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,036
Candlesticks.

569
00:38:45,214 --> 00:38:47,963
- Which period?
- 17th-century. Repair.

570
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,958
Mr Oldman.

571
00:38:56,799 --> 00:38:58,078
Mr Oldman.

572
00:38:59,258 --> 00:39:00,420
Yes.

573
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:03,589
What have you decided
about the furniture in this wing?

574
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:05,831
We're only drawing up
the inventory.

575
00:39:06,008 --> 00:39:08,127
Later you can tell me
what to leave out.

576
00:39:08,299 --> 00:39:09,378
Thank you.

577
00:39:11,509 --> 00:39:15,585
Listen, Miss lbbetson, I can't help
thinking about your situation.

578
00:39:15,759 --> 00:39:18,164
I'm sorry to have
intruded on your thoughts.

579
00:39:18,342 --> 00:39:19,918
That's not the point.

580
00:39:20,093 --> 00:39:22,713
I've been wondering how you
can live like this.

581
00:39:22,885 --> 00:39:24,958
I'm organised and self-sufficient,

582
00:39:25,135 --> 00:39:27,968
I don't need any help
but I appreciate your concern.

583
00:39:28,136 --> 00:39:29,464
You're welcome.

584
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:34,796
- See you soon, then.
- Have a good day.

585
00:39:37,136 --> 00:39:38,298
Mr Oldman!

586
00:39:40,388 --> 00:39:41,761
Your contract.

587
00:39:57,681 --> 00:39:59,508
I read it and it seems fine to me.

588
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:02,378
I initialled every page
and signed the last.

589
00:40:02,557 --> 00:40:04,381
That's how it's done, isn't it?

590
00:40:04,557 --> 00:40:05,670
Perfect.

591
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:08,135
But your personal details
are missing.

592
00:40:11,892 --> 00:40:13,384
Take them from my passport.

593
00:40:23,976 --> 00:40:25,966
But it expired quite some time ago.

594
00:40:26,142 --> 00:40:29,722
- Personal details never expire.
- That's true enough, I suppose.

595
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:32,762
I was just a girl then
but it'll do for your purposes.

596
00:40:47,729 --> 00:40:50,599
I wanted to mention
that in certain critical cases

597
00:40:50,773 --> 00:40:53,521
my advice is to proceed
directly to restoration.

598
00:40:53,689 --> 00:40:54,886
You know best.

599
00:40:55,064 --> 00:40:57,812
It means the whole thing
will take a little longer.

600
00:40:57,981 --> 00:41:00,303
We can widen
the scope of the valuation.

601
00:41:00,648 --> 00:41:01,761
I understand.

602
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,973
You dye your hair.
I never noticed.

603
00:41:19,317 --> 00:41:22,979
I'm disgusted by people
who don't trust their own hair!

604
00:41:23,152 --> 00:41:25,984
I don't trust people who think so
much of themselves

605
00:41:26,152 --> 00:41:27,978
that they won't come outside.

606
00:41:29,402 --> 00:41:33,348
Ah, sir, there'll be no more
caretaker service as from Monday.

607
00:41:33,528 --> 00:41:36,478
I'll just come in to bring
Miss lbbetson her shopping.

608
00:41:36,652 --> 00:41:39,770
- The matter is of no interest to me.
- These are the keys.

609
00:41:40,905 --> 00:41:44,980
- Why give them to me?
- It's what Miss lbbetson wanted.

610
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:48,021
In case you needed access
for further inspection.

611
00:41:50,864 --> 00:41:52,936
When you come in, slam the door,

612
00:41:53,281 --> 00:41:55,734
otherwise she'll get scared
and panic.

613
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:09,864
I'm going off my head

614
00:42:10,033 --> 00:42:12,782
trying to work out the alignment
of these devices,

615
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:15,651
trying to figure out
which one fitted into which.

616
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:18,195
- That can't be easy.
- But not impossible.

617
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,152
You know,
gearboxes are like people.

618
00:42:23,076 --> 00:42:25,281
If they've been together
long enough,

619
00:42:25,451 --> 00:42:27,939
eventually,
they take on each other's forms.

620
00:42:28,868 --> 00:42:33,193
So, you believe time can make
any kind of cohabitation possible?

621
00:42:33,369 --> 00:42:34,944
Yeah, well, absolutely.

622
00:42:35,287 --> 00:42:38,533
You've reminded me of a friend
who met a much younger girl.

623
00:42:38,703 --> 00:42:40,244
She had agoraphobia.

624
00:42:40,578 --> 00:42:42,733
Fear of open spaces
and distances?

625
00:42:43,077 --> 00:42:47,025
Exactly. She lived for years locked
up in an apartment on her own.

626
00:42:48,245 --> 00:42:52,536
Recently, she gave him the keys
to her house and ever since,

627
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:54,861
he's been in a state of...

628
00:42:56,455 --> 00:42:57,828
...permanent anxiety.

629
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:04,119
What did I tell you? Now
he'll be constantly worried about her.

630
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,535
He'll be thinking,

631
00:43:05,707 --> 00:43:09,571
"What does she need, shampoo,
medicine, tights... yoghurt?"

632
00:43:09,915 --> 00:43:11,457
lt's beautiful, isn't it?

633
00:43:12,331 --> 00:43:13,824
I'm not so sure.

634
00:43:14,165 --> 00:43:15,954
Tell your friend to stay calm,

635
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:18,956
'cause time is already
working on their gearboxes.

636
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:30,121
And there you are, Mr. Oldman.

637
00:43:34,585 --> 00:43:37,371
- Are you angry with me?
- Why should I be?

638
00:43:37,545 --> 00:43:40,115
- What I said about your hair.
- Not at all.

639
00:43:41,172 --> 00:43:42,497
I was just calling to ask

640
00:43:42,671 --> 00:43:46,829
if you wish the sale of the furniture
to be identified by your family name.

641
00:43:47,003 --> 00:43:48,875
Or do you prefer anonymity?

642
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:51,582
- Anonymity, anonymity.
- Good.

643
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:54,538
This time, I did see you.

644
00:43:54,714 --> 00:43:56,207
- Oh?
- On TV.

645
00:43:56,382 --> 00:43:59,379
I don't generally give interviews
but I was forced to.

646
00:43:59,548 --> 00:44:01,373
You're more intriguing this way.

647
00:44:01,548 --> 00:44:04,214
You'll be a great success
with the ladies.

648
00:44:04,547 --> 00:44:06,585
So, we go to Lot 132.

649
00:44:06,756 --> 00:44:09,293
Gustave Rett,
Portrait of a Woman With a Hat.

650
00:44:09,633 --> 00:44:14,704
1956. Oil on canvas. 80 x 100 cm.

651
00:44:14,881 --> 00:44:17,253
This one goes to the best offer.

652
00:44:17,591 --> 00:44:19,214
10,000.

653
00:44:29,051 --> 00:44:32,499
Fred, any news from Miss lbbetson?
She hasn't answered in days.

654
00:44:32,677 --> 00:44:34,916
It's a while
since I heard from her.

655
00:44:35,093 --> 00:44:36,918
I've been in bed all week, ill.

656
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:39,048
Who's been bringing her food?

657
00:44:47,137 --> 00:44:48,416
Miss lbbetson?

658
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:56,678
Miss lbbetson?

659
00:45:07,098 --> 00:45:09,136
Miss lbbetson? Answer me!

660
00:45:12,722 --> 00:45:14,926
Claire?

661
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,014
Claire, are you alright?

662
00:45:19,515 --> 00:45:21,305
Oh, no. Please!

663
00:45:21,475 --> 00:45:23,430
- No. It's me, Claire.
- Get out!

664
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,471
- It's me, Mr. Oldman.
- Go away!

665
00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:27,927
- Listen to me, it's Mr. Oldman.
- Get out!

666
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:30,637
There's nobody else here.
Calm down.

667
00:45:30,809 --> 00:45:32,847
What's wrong?
Tell me what happened.

668
00:45:34,102 --> 00:45:35,593
I wasn't well.

669
00:45:35,768 --> 00:45:37,805
I didn't know who to call.

670
00:45:37,976 --> 00:45:39,139
Nobody answered.

671
00:45:39,311 --> 00:45:41,633
And then I fell.

672
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:44,761
I fell and I hit my...

673
00:45:45,102 --> 00:45:46,808
Open the door.

674
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:48,686
You need to see a doctor.

675
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:51,688
No, please! Please!

676
00:45:52,021 --> 00:45:54,344
Please, no!

677
00:45:57,437 --> 00:45:59,641
Can you fix a broken auctioneer
as well?

678
00:45:59,979 --> 00:46:01,768
I wouldn't know where to begin.

679
00:46:02,105 --> 00:46:04,427
It's good to see you again,
Mr. Oldman.

680
00:46:04,605 --> 00:46:08,222
Is something wrong? You seem
more preoccupied than usual.

681
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,354
Too many woodworms
and spider webs

682
00:46:10,523 --> 00:46:12,762
and too few masterpieces.

683
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:14,480
Could we put it that way?

684
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,344
- So, how's our toy coming along?
- Ah.

685
00:46:18,524 --> 00:46:21,605
Well, I've managed to put
some sections back together.

686
00:46:23,483 --> 00:46:27,181
But, I mean, there's just still
too many pieces missing.

687
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:30,105
The entire exterior.

688
00:46:30,442 --> 00:46:33,274
We can't establish
what kind of character he is.

689
00:46:33,608 --> 00:46:36,098
Like my friend
and his girl in the tower.

690
00:46:36,443 --> 00:46:39,311
Yeah, maybe, although
we've never seen our android.

691
00:46:39,484 --> 00:46:41,640
We're still groping around
in the dark.

692
00:46:41,985 --> 00:46:43,360
So is he.

693
00:46:43,776 --> 00:46:46,017
He speaks to her
through a closed door.

694
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:48,434
- Closed door?
- Yes.

695
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:52,687
If anybody moves in the house,
she barricades herself in her room.

696
00:46:53,028 --> 00:46:57,188
- He's never seen her face?
- Not only him, no-one has.

697
00:46:57,362 --> 00:47:00,361
That's like when two young people
meet on the internet.

698
00:47:00,697 --> 00:47:03,813
They get to know each other,
then reveal themselves.

699
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:05,694
She won't reveal herself.

700
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,730
Maybe he hasn't
got a good strategy.

701
00:47:10,197 --> 00:47:13,777
So, it's more difficult for my friend
to succeed in his enterprise

702
00:47:13,948 --> 00:47:16,899
than for us to reconstruct
the Vaucanson automaton?

703
00:47:17,074 --> 00:47:20,902
Depends on the number of rusty
pieces you're able to bring me.

704
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,614
Well...

705
00:47:23,824 --> 00:47:25,364
...here's one more.

706
00:47:27,365 --> 00:47:28,859
That's a mobile phone.

707
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:31,189
This is brand new.

708
00:47:31,367 --> 00:47:34,649
I'm the one that's rusty
because I don't know how to use it.

709
00:47:34,993 --> 00:47:37,943
Could you teach me
before your girlfriend gets here?

710
00:47:57,037 --> 00:47:59,526
- Hello.
- Good evening, Mr. Oldman.

711
00:47:59,704 --> 00:48:02,075
It's Claire Ibbetson.
Am I disturbing you?

712
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:04,202
No, not at all, Miss lbbetson.

713
00:48:04,371 --> 00:48:07,866
I told you, from now on,
you can call me any time you like.

714
00:48:08,037 --> 00:48:09,578
I wanted to thank you for...

715
00:48:10,705 --> 00:48:12,282
...everything, really.

716
00:48:12,455 --> 00:48:15,867
No need. All that's important
is you're feeling better now.

717
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:19,039
Yes, it was just a small cut
on the head. I'm much better.

718
00:48:19,209 --> 00:48:21,992
I wanted to tell you,
I looked over the inventory.

719
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,571
Oh! What do you think?

720
00:48:25,832 --> 00:48:28,155
You've done a great job.
Really, you have.

721
00:48:29,375 --> 00:48:31,531
But I'm troubled
by so many doubts.

722
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:35,406
I'm not sure if it's a good idea
to sell. What would you advise?

723
00:48:35,585 --> 00:48:38,369
I couldn't say. I don't know
what your plans are.

724
00:48:38,709 --> 00:48:41,280
Why did you decide
to sell in the first place?

725
00:48:41,459 --> 00:48:45,324
Out of necessity in order to start
life afresh or another reason?

726
00:48:45,668 --> 00:48:47,623
All of the above, I suppose.

727
00:48:47,793 --> 00:48:50,827
I'd even sell the house.
It's too big for me now.

728
00:48:51,003 --> 00:48:54,664
Sometimes, I feel as though
I were in a public square.

729
00:48:54,836 --> 00:48:56,873
I'd like something smaller.

730
00:48:57,045 --> 00:48:58,953
But the idea of having to leave here

731
00:48:59,127 --> 00:49:01,414
and go somewhere else
fills me with dread.

732
00:49:01,587 --> 00:49:03,210
How would I manage it?

733
00:49:03,379 --> 00:49:06,661
Wear blindfolds? Have myself
carried out while asleep?

734
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:10,169
I'd get into a state and end up
putting everything off.

735
00:49:13,256 --> 00:49:16,206
You have all the time in the world
to make up your mind.

736
00:49:16,505 --> 00:49:19,457
- You think?
- Well, until the catalogue is printed.

737
00:49:19,797 --> 00:49:23,743
Don't torment yourself.
Think of yourself, your future.

738
00:49:23,923 --> 00:49:25,998
That's the biggest torment of all.

739
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,497
When I think about it,
I can't even work.

740
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,080
I didn't know you were working.

741
00:49:31,258 --> 00:49:35,582
I write. I write novels, stories,
things like that.

742
00:49:35,926 --> 00:49:38,045
I'd like to read them. I'll buy some.

743
00:49:38,382 --> 00:49:40,787
Luckily for us,
you'll never manage to.

744
00:49:41,133 --> 00:49:42,508
Why not?

745
00:49:42,675 --> 00:49:46,422
Because I write under a pseudonym
and I loathe what I write.

746
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,758
Artists always loathe
what they make, Miss lbbetson.

747
00:49:49,928 --> 00:49:51,882
Yesterday, you called me Claire.

748
00:49:53,926 --> 00:49:56,879
I wasn't aware.
I was in a state of alarm.

749
00:49:57,053 --> 00:49:59,423
- Sorry.
- I'd like you to continue.

750
00:50:00,887 --> 00:50:04,883
"I'd like you to continue."
She said it to him, just like that.

751
00:50:05,055 --> 00:50:06,593
Well, what did he say?

752
00:50:06,762 --> 00:50:09,759
He was taken back but he went
along with what she wanted.

753
00:50:10,096 --> 00:50:11,554
What else could he do?

754
00:50:11,886 --> 00:50:14,969
I'd have asked her to do the same,
call me by my first name.

755
00:50:15,139 --> 00:50:16,631
That's not his style.

756
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,757
Besides, I don't think my friend
intends to court her.

757
00:50:19,932 --> 00:50:22,336
Then he'll never get her out of there.

758
00:50:22,513 --> 00:50:25,677
I don't
think my friend intends to court her.

759
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:28,763
I don't think my friend
intends to court her.

760
00:50:28,933 --> 00:50:30,129
Horrible voice!

761
00:50:30,473 --> 00:50:33,721
I'd have thought he'd at least
have desired to see her face.

762
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:36,723
'Desired's probably
not the right word.

763
00:50:36,892 --> 00:50:40,802
Curious to see her, perhaps.
Yes, I could understand that.

764
00:50:40,975 --> 00:50:44,057
But the chances of it happening
seem to be really remote.

765
00:50:44,226 --> 00:50:45,553
There might be a way.

766
00:50:45,894 --> 00:50:48,216
Just depends on how brave
your friend is.

767
00:50:49,518 --> 00:50:52,006
- The French bureau.
- Yes.

768
00:50:52,185 --> 00:50:56,049
- The table with the roll top.
- No, I'd like to keep that.

769
00:50:56,393 --> 00:50:59,143
That's it.
Next time, we'll do the paintings.

770
00:50:59,478 --> 00:51:01,385
- OK.
- One last thing, Claire.

771
00:51:01,562 --> 00:51:05,425
You'll have to decide whether we do
the photography here or in a studio.

772
00:51:05,769 --> 00:51:08,721
In a studio. I don't want
many people around the house.

773
00:51:09,062 --> 00:51:11,729
That's the best solution.
Well, I'm off now.

774
00:51:11,896 --> 00:51:14,811
- Anything you need?
- No. Thank you, Mr. Oldman.

775
00:51:16,146 --> 00:51:18,019
When will we next see each other?

776
00:51:19,356 --> 00:51:24,014
You mean, when do you see me?
Since I am not given that privilege.

777
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:27,435
- Forgive me.
- But soon.

778
00:51:28,523 --> 00:51:30,679
- Have a good day.
- You too.

779
00:53:07,286 --> 00:53:08,363
Hello?

780
00:53:33,749 --> 00:53:36,865
- I can't believe it.
- I couldn't sleep at night, Virgil.

781
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,121
I had to do something to make
you forgive me.

782
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:42,033
But how did you get it?

783
00:53:42,376 --> 00:53:45,456
I heard that Mrs. Durane
had fallen on hard times,

784
00:53:45,625 --> 00:53:50,330
so I persuaded her to sell it to me
for 250,000.

785
00:53:50,499 --> 00:53:52,706
Hmm, not exactly cheap!

786
00:53:52,876 --> 00:53:54,867
I thought it was a reasonable price.

787
00:53:55,209 --> 00:53:57,199
You were talking about 8 million.

788
00:53:57,376 --> 00:53:59,615
This way,
everyone gets a good deal.

789
00:54:01,086 --> 00:54:02,873
How much do you want, Billy?

790
00:54:03,042 --> 00:54:05,662
I don't want a penny more
than I gave the old girl.

791
00:54:05,836 --> 00:54:07,873
Now you're really losing your grip.

792
00:54:08,212 --> 00:54:10,368
I just want to get back
to where we were.

793
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:13,461
How was your friend,
your accomplice,

794
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:15,833
your trusted procurer of women?

795
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:21,200
lf you're doing this to win back my
trust, it's been a bad deal for you.

796
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,918
You never lost it in the first place.

797
00:54:25,257 --> 00:54:27,163
Oh!

798
00:54:28,674 --> 00:54:31,753
This is great.
This is great!

799
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:33,831
You found important stuff.

800
00:54:34,005 --> 00:54:35,877
Best bit is this.

801
00:54:38,172 --> 00:54:41,042
- An ear.
- A step forward, wouldn't you say?

802
00:54:41,382 --> 00:54:43,837
I'd say!
I'd say we're at a turning point.

803
00:54:44,008 --> 00:54:45,251
Look.

804
00:54:51,383 --> 00:54:53,090
- Huh?
- Excellent.

805
00:54:53,424 --> 00:54:55,914
The pieces are attracting each other.

806
00:54:56,093 --> 00:54:57,123
So...

807
00:54:58,469 --> 00:55:01,716
How did things go with your... friend?

808
00:55:04,052 --> 00:55:08,045
How many seconds did it take you
to realise I was talking about myself?

809
00:55:08,218 --> 00:55:10,044
Quite a few, to be honest.

810
00:55:10,218 --> 00:55:12,838
Let me confess,
I didn't follow your advice.

811
00:55:13,928 --> 00:55:17,969
There was something too contorted
about it, too imprudent.

812
00:55:18,137 --> 00:55:19,714
Yeah, OK, I see your point.

813
00:55:40,806 --> 00:55:44,883
The mathematical set
of a six-day week.

814
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:51,131
The mathematical set
of a 51-minute hour.

815
00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:55,302
- What will you have, sir?
- Tea, please.

816
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,599
Have you thought of anything else?

817
00:55:57,769 --> 00:56:00,387
The length of a point.
The direction of a circle.

818
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,799
Your tea's ready, sir.

819
00:56:02,976 --> 00:56:06,722
The edge of a circumference.
The centre of space.

820
00:56:08,853 --> 00:56:13,178
- The area of a segment.
- Amazing. Well done!

821
00:56:14,312 --> 00:56:16,930
The vertical position of a sphere.

822
00:56:18,854 --> 00:56:21,604
I brought the furniture
and painting valuations.

823
00:56:21,771 --> 00:56:25,183
Look at them carefully because
you'll have to authorise them.

824
00:56:25,354 --> 00:56:29,301
- I don't know a thing about this.
- I know. Trust me, Miss lbbetson.

825
00:56:29,481 --> 00:56:32,311
You've been spending time
in the cellars recently.

826
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,142
- Is that why you changed the locks?
- I change them every six months.

827
00:56:39,107 --> 00:56:41,891
And I take care to double-check,
compare and correct

828
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:45,017
when dealing with
odds and ends in cellars.

829
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:47,643
It's how I work.
If it upsets you, speak now.

830
00:56:48,024 --> 00:56:51,686
You'll find the new keys on the table.
Please take them.

831
00:56:56,109 --> 00:56:58,230
Thank you for your trust.

832
00:56:58,401 --> 00:57:00,557
Were you offended
at being locked out?

833
00:57:00,734 --> 00:57:01,930
No, but I was worried.

834
00:57:03,275 --> 00:57:06,357
You're right, I should have told you.
I'm sorry.

835
00:57:08,484 --> 00:57:12,065
Claire, you're ruining your life
for reasons which are beyond me.

836
00:57:12,403 --> 00:57:15,983
This illness of yours is so absurd,
it almost seems unreal.

837
00:57:17,653 --> 00:57:20,271
My mother thought
I was faking it the first time.

838
00:57:20,444 --> 00:57:21,819
We were abroad.

839
00:57:21,987 --> 00:57:24,985
I was so afraid of walking
at the foot of the Eiffel Tower

840
00:57:25,155 --> 00:57:26,563
that it paralysed me.

841
00:57:26,737 --> 00:57:29,691
I started screaming,
fell to the ground.

842
00:57:29,864 --> 00:57:33,064
I was just a little girl, but it kept
happening more and more

843
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:34,779
and she had to believe me.

844
00:57:34,947 --> 00:57:36,737
Has there ever been an open space

845
00:57:36,905 --> 00:57:39,274
where you weren't overcome
by anxiety?

846
00:57:39,447 --> 00:57:44,189
Only one. During a school trip
to Prague. I was 14.

847
00:57:44,365 --> 00:57:46,652
The square
with the astronomical clock.

848
00:57:46,824 --> 00:57:50,818
I must have walked across it
a hundred times. It was beautiful.

849
00:57:51,158 --> 00:57:54,273
I remember a restaurant
with very strange decor.

850
00:57:55,492 --> 00:57:58,939
If there's one place in the world
I'm nostalgic for, it's that.

851
00:57:59,117 --> 00:58:00,574
I was really happy there.

852
00:58:01,992 --> 00:58:04,397
It was called Night and Day.

853
00:58:05,869 --> 00:58:08,819
- You've never been back?
- Never.

854
00:58:10,243 --> 00:58:14,024
Why not go now?
I'd be happy to take you.

855
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:23,155
Well, you don't seem too pleased.
We're almost there.

856
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:27,572
Our automaton is about
to emerge from the shadows.

857
00:58:27,747 --> 00:58:30,151
No, I'm delighted.
You're a force of nature.

858
00:58:32,455 --> 00:58:33,698
It's just that...

859
00:58:34,871 --> 00:58:36,661
...this is one of those evenings

860
00:58:36,831 --> 00:58:39,366
when one feels like this contraption
here...

861
00:58:45,415 --> 00:58:46,576
...incomplete.

862
00:58:47,831 --> 00:58:50,828
Why did you never marry?
You know, never have kids?

863
00:58:51,123 --> 00:58:52,617
The regard I have for women

864
00:58:52,792 --> 00:58:55,789
is equal to the fear
I've always had of them...

865
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:58,448
...and to my failure
to understand them.

866
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:01,788
If that's the rule, then Miss lbbetson

867
00:59:01,958 --> 00:59:05,407
gives every impression
of being the exception.

868
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:06,745
I'm afraid so.

869
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:09,621
Have you really never
set eyes on her?

870
00:59:09,792 --> 00:59:10,955
Just once.

871
00:59:12,002 --> 00:59:13,376
What's she like?

872
00:59:13,543 --> 00:59:17,205
I suppose feeling a certain interest
in a person

873
00:59:17,376 --> 00:59:20,957
necessarily engenders
a conviction that she's beautiful.

874
00:59:21,128 --> 00:59:22,786
Up to a point.

875
00:59:24,546 --> 00:59:28,207
It's her birthday in two days.
I'd like to get her something useful.

876
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:32,623
I don't think useful
is probably your best approach.

877
00:59:32,961 --> 00:59:34,420
- No?
- Not the first time.

878
00:59:34,587 --> 00:59:37,586
It's better to get her something
more... traditional.

879
00:59:42,674 --> 00:59:43,869
Morning, sir.

880
00:59:46,298 --> 00:59:48,122
Hello, sir.

881
00:59:48,465 --> 00:59:51,332
Hey, Mr. Oldman.
Look what I found in the cellar.

882
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:54,877
I saw you were interested
in this old junk.

883
00:59:56,257 --> 00:59:58,379
The supports for
the Murano chandelier.

884
00:59:58,717 --> 01:00:00,671
My colleagues couldn't find them.

885
01:00:00,842 --> 01:00:04,041
- I can put them in your car.
- That's very kind.

886
01:00:05,801 --> 01:00:07,043
Wait.

887
01:00:08,801 --> 01:00:09,962
Oh, thanks.

888
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,456
Morning, Mr. Oldman.

889
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:18,459
I took the liberty of remembering
it's your birthday.

890
01:00:18,928 --> 01:00:20,338
Happy birthday, Claire.

891
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:26,051
I read
the valuation documents.

892
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:28,460
Did you manage to understand
some of it?

893
01:00:28,635 --> 01:00:30,674
Of course.
Ridiculous sums of money.

894
01:00:30,845 --> 01:00:33,844
Even a backwards child
would know she's being cheated.

895
01:00:34,013 --> 01:00:36,845
They need interpretation.
They're starting bids.

896
01:00:37,013 --> 01:00:40,095
- There'll be higher bids later.
- Suppose there aren't!

897
01:00:40,263 --> 01:00:43,012
Unlikely, but in that case,
we'll even things out.

898
01:00:43,179 --> 01:00:45,503
We'll raise the margins
on other pieces.

899
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:48,299
A gamble? Where I'm the only one
that can lose?

900
01:00:48,473 --> 01:00:51,554
You're trying to cheat me.
It's all to your advantage.

901
01:00:51,724 --> 01:00:53,348
You're a fucking thief!

902
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:57,264
I'm willing to resign
the commission forthwith.

903
01:00:58,473 --> 01:00:59,503
Huh!

904
01:01:01,349 --> 01:01:05,094
I'll have them replace all your
mediocre bric-a-brac immediately.

905
01:01:05,267 --> 01:01:07,887
And do me the favour
of disappearing completely

906
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,518
from the face of the earth!

907
01:01:54,106 --> 01:01:55,648
1984, sir.

908
01:02:12,651 --> 01:02:15,648
- Hello.
- I behaved so badly.

909
01:02:19,735 --> 01:02:24,025
I feel so stupid. I constantly have
to offer justifications.

910
01:02:26,486 --> 01:02:29,023
I've never been given flowers
before.

911
01:02:29,195 --> 01:02:34,100
I don't know what this says to me.

912
01:02:35,904 --> 01:02:39,565
There's no need for this display
of anguish. I'm not angry with you.

913
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:46,018
My birthdays have always been
so horrible.

914
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:49,571
And you...

915
01:02:49,739 --> 01:02:51,195
Since you came along...

916
01:02:52,406 --> 01:02:55,275
...you've turned my life upside down.

917
01:02:57,989 --> 01:03:00,739
The other day, I went downstairs.

918
01:03:01,991 --> 01:03:05,985
I opened the main door
and looked out onto the garden.

919
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:10,112
- Did you go out?
- No.

920
01:03:11,991 --> 01:03:13,781
I was afraid.

921
01:03:13,949 --> 01:03:15,490
I felt terrible.

922
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:19,447
But I never even got that far before.

923
01:03:23,494 --> 01:03:25,034
Do you want me to come over?

924
01:03:26,867 --> 01:03:28,574
I already know it's pointless.

925
01:03:28,742 --> 01:03:31,824
There are new treatments
nowadays. They might help you.

926
01:03:31,993 --> 01:03:34,281
I'd rather talk to you
than to some shrink.

927
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:38,660
- Should I take that as a compliment?
- Yes.

928
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:44,900
I see you brought up
the portrait of the dancer.

929
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,827
- It's something I want to keep.
- No great value.

930
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:50,947
It's a portrait of my mother.

931
01:03:51,123 --> 01:03:53,327
She was about my age
when she had it done.

932
01:03:57,456 --> 01:03:58,865
Do you look like her?

933
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:02,536
- She was prettier, I can assure you.
- I cannot judge.

934
01:04:12,083 --> 01:04:13,576
Alright, Claire. I'll go.

935
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,950
Don't hesitate to call
if you need anything at all.

936
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:19,201
Thank you, Mr. Oldman.
See you soon, I hope.

937
01:05:07,174 --> 01:05:10,087
Hello? Oh, it's you, director.

938
01:05:10,466 --> 01:05:12,955
No, I would've called you,
it's just that...

939
01:05:13,132 --> 01:05:15,966
...clearing the furniture
has been complicated.

940
01:05:17,426 --> 01:05:19,796
Yes. Oldman is dealing with it.

941
01:05:20,676 --> 01:05:24,455
What's he like?
Not as old as you might think.

942
01:05:24,842 --> 01:05:28,587
He dresses in an odd way,
but he's still a good-looking man.

943
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:30,924
I know I can trust him.

944
01:05:31,095 --> 01:05:34,426
Why? Are you jealous?

945
01:05:35,053 --> 01:05:37,885
In love? No, I don't think so.

946
01:05:38,094 --> 01:05:40,842
He's too put off by my illness,
like everybody.

947
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:45,416
Oh no, it's nothing.
I... I hurt my foot.

948
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:47,420
Can we talk later?

949
01:06:13,059 --> 01:06:14,302
Who is it?

950
01:06:15,183 --> 01:06:16,723
Who's there?

951
01:06:17,725 --> 01:06:20,260
No, get out!
No, please, get out!

952
01:06:20,683 --> 01:06:22,969
Go away! Get out!

953
01:06:23,351 --> 01:06:26,349
Get out! Please, leave me alone!

954
01:06:28,227 --> 01:06:29,767
Get out!

955
01:06:32,435 --> 01:06:33,974
Get out!

956
01:06:49,146 --> 01:06:53,091
- Hello?
- Please, help me, please.

957
01:06:53,353 --> 01:06:55,925
Calm down, Claire.
What's happened?

958
01:06:56,189 --> 01:06:58,890
You have to help me!
Help me!

959
01:06:59,147 --> 01:07:02,063
- I'll be there as soon as I can.
- Please.

960
01:07:57,654 --> 01:07:59,196
Claire!

961
01:07:59,404 --> 01:08:03,353
- It's me. I'm here. What's happened?
- There's somebody in the house!

962
01:08:03,574 --> 01:08:06,605
- Please get them out!
- Calm down. There's nobody here.

963
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:09,151
- There's someone in the house!
- Calm down.

964
01:08:09,489 --> 01:08:12,523
It was me before, Claire.
It was me.

965
01:08:14,115 --> 01:08:15,656
It was me.

966
01:08:18,409 --> 01:08:20,978
I hid in the room so I could see you.

967
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:24,949
You were spying on me?

968
01:08:26,075 --> 01:08:28,150
You were spying on me?

969
01:08:28,742 --> 01:08:30,200
Get out!

970
01:08:30,367 --> 01:08:33,484
I want nothing more to do with you!
Get out!

971
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:46,179
Please, Virgil. Don't go.

972
01:09:03,944 --> 01:09:07,060
Believe me,
I don't normally behave like this...

973
01:09:08,653 --> 01:09:10,193
Neither do I.

974
01:09:11,194 --> 01:09:14,312
So I'm bound to make some
mistakes...

975
01:09:16,779 --> 01:09:20,309
...but nothing in the world
would make me want to hurt you.

976
01:09:21,486 --> 01:09:24,769
It's just that I can't help myself.

977
01:09:26,989 --> 01:09:28,861
I need to see you.

978
01:10:05,411 --> 01:10:07,235
You should've seen her.

979
01:10:08,619 --> 01:10:11,403
Pale, like a Durer etching.

980
01:10:11,953 --> 01:10:15,284
She had the look of some creature
terrified of the universe.

981
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:18,369
And I could read my own terror
in her eyes.

982
01:10:18,704 --> 01:10:23,243
Every man on earth would like to be
as terrified as you at this moment.

983
01:10:31,374 --> 01:10:34,156
- You've worked a miracle.
- It's too soon to tell.

984
01:10:34,539 --> 01:10:38,201
And you be careful, alright?
This is when mistakes occur.

985
01:10:38,539 --> 01:10:40,495
When you think you've made it,

986
01:10:40,873 --> 01:10:42,663
that is when you lose strategy.

987
01:10:42,999 --> 01:10:46,946
- And what strategy would that be?
- Never stop surprising them.

988
01:10:47,124 --> 01:10:51,746
Do things they couldn't have
foreseen. Take a gamble, run a risk.

989
01:10:52,083 --> 01:10:54,916
You're asking me to behave
in a way that isn't me.

990
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,325
That's why you have to do it.

991
01:10:58,125 --> 01:11:00,875
As long as you're playing
according to her rules,

992
01:11:01,043 --> 01:11:04,244
you're always gonna make her
feel like... like a patient.

993
01:11:04,418 --> 01:11:06,824
She needs to be treated
like a woman.

994
01:11:37,589 --> 01:11:39,663
What do you think? Do you like it?

995
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:45,048
I don't know.

996
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:47,882
What do you think?

997
01:11:48,882 --> 01:11:50,873
lt looks marvellous on you, Claire.

998
01:11:51,631 --> 01:11:53,255
Perhaps the smaller size?

999
01:11:54,134 --> 01:11:56,753
Yes. I think so too.

1000
01:12:10,467 --> 01:12:13,302
It's been a long time
since I got a present like this.

1001
01:12:14,929 --> 01:12:18,340
- Long overdue, don't you think?
- I don't know.

1002
01:12:18,718 --> 01:12:21,468
I'm a little,
you know, taken a back.

1003
01:12:28,513 --> 01:12:30,551
- I'm sorry, I can't...
- What?

1004
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:33,667
Oh, certainly.

1005
01:12:34,554 --> 01:12:37,470
I'm sorry.
I didn't understand.

1006
01:12:46,057 --> 01:12:49,139
I don't honestly know
if I deserve all this.

1007
01:12:52,473 --> 01:12:54,929
Let me be the judge of that.

1008
01:13:13,435 --> 01:13:16,103
If we don't set a date
for the Stockholm auction,

1009
01:13:16,269 --> 01:13:17,763
they'll shoot themselves.

1010
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:20,423
It's too far.
Let them shoot themselves.

1011
01:13:23,187 --> 01:13:26,350
We have to schedule the meeting
with the Hermitage

1012
01:13:26,687 --> 01:13:29,436
and the auctions in
San Francisco and Madrid.

1013
01:13:29,603 --> 01:13:31,062
Ditto. Too far away.

1014
01:13:31,354 --> 01:13:34,887
- We can't abandon them.
- There are auctioneers galore.

1015
01:13:35,064 --> 01:13:37,978
They'll find someone else
and it will cost them less.

1016
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:39,425
As you wish.

1017
01:13:44,816 --> 01:13:46,936
Lambert, are you married?

1018
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:50,310
Yes. Nearly 30 years.

1019
01:13:50,648 --> 01:13:53,184
What's it like, living with a woman?

1020
01:13:53,566 --> 01:13:55,439
Like taking part in an auction.

1021
01:13:56,107 --> 01:13:59,271
You never know if yours
will be the best offer.

1022
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:27,647
- This one.
- Very well, sir.

1023
01:14:29,404 --> 01:14:32,319
What do you think?
Have I made myself pretty?

1024
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:36,600
- Beautiful. You've done very well.
- Liar.

1025
01:14:36,779 --> 01:14:39,149
- Claire.
- I haven't done this for years.

1026
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:42,487
I've forgotten how to do it.
I look like a monster.

1027
01:14:42,656 --> 01:14:45,569
Trust me. Some practice
and you'll be wonderful.

1028
01:14:45,739 --> 01:14:48,193
And you'll take me to
one of your auctions,

1029
01:14:48,364 --> 01:14:50,272
and to galas with elegant people,

1030
01:14:50,614 --> 01:14:54,062
and to the most refined restaurants
in the world.

1031
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:58,402
That's the reason for your
presents, isn't it, Virgil?

1032
01:14:59,366 --> 01:15:02,613
To help me recover little by little,
and then take me out.

1033
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:04,739
Isn't that right?

1034
01:15:07,159 --> 01:15:08,616
No!

1035
01:15:08,785 --> 01:15:11,024
Claire. Don't be like this.
Let's talk.

1036
01:15:15,283 --> 01:15:19,527
Maybe we did get the last moves
wrong. I was a bit rash.

1037
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:21,403
Don't blame yourself.

1038
01:15:21,578 --> 01:15:24,944
It's always her who manages
to pull everything apart.

1039
01:15:25,285 --> 01:15:27,490
Robert. My aunt's gone missing
again.

1040
01:15:27,662 --> 01:15:29,367
- You're kidding.
- Pardon me.

1041
01:15:29,704 --> 01:15:32,820
- We found her in Central Park.
- I'm sorry, Terry.

1042
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:35,910
It was no good
trying to reset this thing.

1043
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:39,410
It was much more easy
just to make a new one.

1044
01:15:39,579 --> 01:15:42,116
This one has a much wider range.

1045
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:44,778
She can go off
and you won't lose touch.

1046
01:15:45,122 --> 01:15:47,659
Just make sure
you reprogram the PC, okay?

1047
01:15:47,831 --> 01:15:49,987
I can manage that.
You're an angel.

1048
01:15:50,915 --> 01:15:52,705
- Thanks, darling.
- No worries.

1049
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:56,414
- I'll see you tomorrow night, yeah?
- Yeah.

1050
01:15:58,583 --> 01:16:03,785
You need an idea that'll excite her
but at the same time reassure her.

1051
01:16:03,999 --> 01:16:08,574
Yes, but she'll still see through it
as some deceitful therapy.

1052
01:16:08,875 --> 01:16:12,241
- You should invite her to dinner.
- Yes! Noma in Copenhagen!

1053
01:16:12,586 --> 01:16:15,119
At the climax of the evening,
by candlelight,

1054
01:16:15,459 --> 01:16:17,746
tell her that she's beautiful.

1055
01:16:18,084 --> 01:16:20,205
And after
you'll have coffee with us?

1056
01:16:20,544 --> 01:16:22,085
Why not?

1057
01:16:24,002 --> 01:16:28,376
Joking apart, I'd be glad
if you did see her, hear her talk.

1058
01:16:28,754 --> 01:16:31,585
I'm sure you'd understand
far more than I.

1059
01:16:33,377 --> 01:16:35,416
Who said anything about joking?

1060
01:16:36,962 --> 01:16:41,172
129,403.

1061
01:16:41,339 --> 01:16:43,045
Your champagne.

1062
01:16:43,673 --> 01:16:45,710
- Thank you.
- Calculate this.

1063
01:16:46,629 --> 01:16:52,628
12,624,831.333.

1064
01:16:55,049 --> 01:16:56,591
Unbelievable!

1065
01:17:02,131 --> 01:17:03,707
You're radiant, Claire.

1066
01:17:05,757 --> 01:17:07,167
You did all this?

1067
01:17:07,341 --> 01:17:10,043
I can turn my hand
to interior decorating.

1068
01:17:19,007 --> 01:17:22,505
You've done a wonderful job, Virgil.
Thank you.

1069
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:32,042
I can't tell you how long I've wanted
to spend time alone with you.

1070
01:17:32,386 --> 01:17:35,883
Somewhere quiet,
far from the madding crowd.

1071
01:17:41,303 --> 01:17:43,377
To your serenity, Claire.

1072
01:17:45,972 --> 01:17:47,678
To your irony, Virgil.

1073
01:17:53,723 --> 01:17:56,092
- Now I feel I can finally tell you.
- What?

1074
01:17:56,431 --> 01:17:58,965
You are more beautiful than the
dancer.

1075
01:18:01,682 --> 01:18:03,175
Dinner is served.

1076
01:18:03,557 --> 01:18:06,047
- Please be seated.
- Thank you.

1077
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:08,761
I warn you, as a waiter
I'm not the best.

1078
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,471
I offer no guarantees.

1079
01:18:12,184 --> 01:18:15,300
- I'll take the risk.
- Somewhat foolhardy of you.

1080
01:18:15,933 --> 01:18:18,968
- Why?
- lf the service is not to your liking,

1081
01:18:19,142 --> 01:18:21,299
next time I'd have to
make a reservation

1082
01:18:21,478 --> 01:18:23,100
at the best restaurant in town.

1083
01:18:25,769 --> 01:18:27,889
Let's not ruin this evening, Virgil.

1084
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:31,509
- Please, let's not talk about me.
- Alright.

1085
01:18:31,853 --> 01:18:34,520
Instead I'd like you to tell me
about your past.

1086
01:18:34,895 --> 01:18:38,094
You see, there's nothing
very original about my life.

1087
01:18:38,438 --> 01:18:41,555
A child loses his parents,
a horrible orphanage...

1088
01:18:41,896 --> 01:18:45,308
The only point of interest is
that the nuns would punish the boy

1089
01:18:45,479 --> 01:18:48,892
by making him work with a restorer
who had a workshop there.

1090
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:50,973
That's beautiful.

1091
01:18:51,147 --> 01:18:53,352
He loved to observe
this craftsman,

1092
01:18:53,689 --> 01:18:57,350
so the little boy got up to
all sorts of mischief

1093
01:18:57,522 --> 01:19:00,438
to ensure he'd be punished
as often as possible.

1094
01:19:00,606 --> 01:19:02,433
So he became acquainted with art,

1095
01:19:02,772 --> 01:19:06,554
techniques of painting,
how to tell a forgery from an original

1096
01:19:06,733 --> 01:19:08,523
etc., etc.

1097
01:19:08,691 --> 01:19:13,681
In an old article of yours
I found on the internet, you said,

1098
01:19:14,023 --> 01:19:17,272
"There's something authentic
in every forgery."

1099
01:19:17,609 --> 01:19:19,018
What did you mean?

1100
01:19:19,191 --> 01:19:21,266
When simulating another's work

1101
01:19:21,651 --> 01:19:25,563
the forger can't resist the temptation
to put in something of himself.

1102
01:19:25,736 --> 01:19:28,850
Often it's just a trifle,
a detail of no interest.

1103
01:19:29,192 --> 01:19:30,770
One unsuspected stroke,

1104
01:19:30,944 --> 01:19:34,191
by which the forger inevitably
ends up betraying himself,

1105
01:19:34,527 --> 01:19:37,811
and revealing his own,
utterly authentic sensibilities.

1106
01:19:38,778 --> 01:19:41,019
I really love the way you talk.

1107
01:19:41,361 --> 01:19:43,732
You couldn't have been
more convincing.

1108
01:19:43,903 --> 01:19:45,695
Huh? A born seducer.

1109
01:19:46,028 --> 01:19:50,070
- So you'd give me a pass?
- A+. With distinction!

1110
01:19:50,404 --> 01:19:53,023
Sorry, you've been
a bit neglected lately.

1111
01:19:54,822 --> 01:19:57,441
You haven't said
anything about Claire.

1112
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:01,901
If I didn't know about her problems,
I'd say she was normal.

1113
01:20:02,281 --> 01:20:05,613
And she's much more beautiful
than you described.

1114
01:20:05,948 --> 01:20:08,402
Really. I liked her.

1115
01:20:08,573 --> 01:20:10,530
You're going to make me jealous?

1116
01:20:10,699 --> 01:20:13,947
lf you want my advice,
you pray that girl never gets better.

1117
01:20:14,282 --> 01:20:16,854
Do you want lots 87 and 88
done separately?

1118
01:20:17,033 --> 01:20:19,405
No, together. That's important.

1119
01:20:25,866 --> 01:20:27,774
How can I help you?

1120
01:20:29,493 --> 01:20:31,899
- It's about Robert.
- What's going on?

1121
01:20:33,910 --> 01:20:35,284
Don't be afraid to tell me.

1122
01:20:37,411 --> 01:20:40,245
We're not getting on so well,
that's the problem.

1123
01:20:40,577 --> 01:20:42,946
All those girls hovering around him...

1124
01:20:44,201 --> 01:20:45,744
I guess I'm just...

1125
01:20:46,327 --> 01:20:47,952
...l'm afraid of losing him.

1126
01:20:49,037 --> 01:20:50,909
Is there anything I can do?

1127
01:20:52,247 --> 01:20:53,788
Do you want me to talk to him?

1128
01:20:55,913 --> 01:21:00,037
For a while now he's been
talking about someone called Claire.

1129
01:21:02,497 --> 01:21:04,039
Claire?

1130
01:21:04,998 --> 01:21:06,870
I don't understand

1131
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:11,449
With him everybody's got to
be on their guard, all the time.

1132
01:21:11,789 --> 01:21:13,532
That goes for you, too.

1133
01:21:16,459 --> 01:21:18,331
I feel so stupid.

1134
01:21:21,626 --> 01:21:23,995
Promise me you won't say a word
to him.

1135
01:21:25,083 --> 01:21:26,742
I promise.

1136
01:21:31,877 --> 01:21:34,448
Have you been
waiting long?

1137
01:21:34,628 --> 01:21:37,378
lf you'd phoned,
I wouldn't have kept you waiting.

1138
01:21:37,545 --> 01:21:40,210
- I prefer to see you.
- Is something wrong?

1139
01:21:40,544 --> 01:21:42,452
My assistant will come by today.

1140
01:21:42,628 --> 01:21:45,626
Kindly hand over the
Vaucanson as it is.

1141
01:21:45,795 --> 01:21:47,868
Alright. Whatever you want.

1142
01:21:48,212 --> 01:21:50,702
Tell him how much you're owed.
He'll pay you.

1143
01:21:52,713 --> 01:21:54,751
Aren't I at least due an explanation?

1144
01:21:54,921 --> 01:21:57,871
You're not the trustworthy man
I thought you were.

1145
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:03,246
lt's weird seeing them so
perfect and polished up.

1146
01:22:03,589 --> 01:22:05,045
It's as if they weren't mine.

1147
01:22:16,258 --> 01:22:18,295
I believe nothing is missing.

1148
01:22:19,465 --> 01:22:21,089
There is something missing.

1149
01:22:41,635 --> 01:22:45,795
How could you have lived
the best years of your life in here?

1150
01:22:46,553 --> 01:22:49,671
I don't know. I don't know.

1151
01:22:50,388 --> 01:22:51,927
It was just the right thing.

1152
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:56,962
"Was."

1153
01:22:58,763 --> 01:23:00,305
lt still is.

1154
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:02,179
It always will be.

1155
01:23:02,930 --> 01:23:04,472
Always.

1156
01:23:11,515 --> 01:23:15,212
You have to get out of here.
You have to do it by yourself.

1157
01:23:16,224 --> 01:23:18,096
I don't have the courage.

1158
01:23:20,267 --> 01:23:23,513
It's a spider's web that
I don't know how to break free of.

1159
01:23:27,975 --> 01:23:30,380
It's an old collection
my father was fond of.

1160
01:23:30,725 --> 01:23:32,846
I never did understand what it was.

1161
01:23:40,019 --> 01:23:42,720
Hello?
Good morning, director.

1162
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:45,683
Yes, I'm nearly finished.

1163
01:23:46,436 --> 01:23:48,924
But I would like to rewrite
the last chapter.

1164
01:23:49,602 --> 01:23:51,678
A more upbeat ending.

1165
01:23:53,771 --> 01:23:55,643
If that's all you want...

1166
01:23:56,479 --> 01:23:59,395
Yes. Talk to you soon. Thanks.

1167
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:05,096
I wouldn't rule out them
being part of something valuable,

1168
01:24:05,272 --> 01:24:07,311
but exactly what I couldn't say.

1169
01:24:07,646 --> 01:24:10,135
- I often wonder if...
- What?

1170
01:24:10,439 --> 01:24:13,354
lf you're more interested
in my furniture than in me.

1171
01:24:15,106 --> 01:24:17,181
How could you say that?

1172
01:24:19,023 --> 01:24:21,938
I shouldn't have let you in here.
I shouldn't have.

1173
01:24:45,485 --> 01:24:47,939
I've found all the missing pieces.

1174
01:24:48,236 --> 01:24:50,523
How do you feel about
finishing the job?

1175
01:24:51,403 --> 01:24:53,310
Well, it's your problem.

1176
01:24:55,486 --> 01:24:57,526
Sarah came to see me
a few days ago.

1177
01:24:57,696 --> 01:24:59,935
She was upset
about your relationship.

1178
01:25:03,405 --> 01:25:07,812
- Are you here to advise me now?
- No, you're the expert on women.

1179
01:25:09,155 --> 01:25:11,821
Alright.
We can pick up where we left off.

1180
01:25:12,156 --> 01:25:13,317
On two conditions.

1181
01:25:13,657 --> 01:25:17,319
You just stop involving me
in your private life.

1182
01:25:18,574 --> 01:25:19,652
And the second?

1183
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:26,947
Is that you take this back.

1184
01:25:32,368 --> 01:25:35,983
I didn't get excited about
your Vaucanson for the money.

1185
01:25:39,451 --> 01:25:41,359
I brought it back. It's in the car.

1186
01:25:41,701 --> 01:25:43,525
And the new pieces too?

1187
01:25:43,868 --> 01:25:47,944
You'll have to be patient for those.
They're tied up with my private life.

1188
01:25:48,287 --> 01:25:51,118
I don't know
and I don't want to know.

1189
01:25:52,495 --> 01:25:56,619
If you were forced to choose
between Claire and the automaton,

1190
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:58,861
which would you take?

1191
01:26:06,246 --> 01:26:09,612
- This one.
- An excellent choice, Mr. Oldman.

1192
01:26:09,955 --> 01:26:11,283
If it's the wrong size,

1193
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:14,573
please inform the lady to pass by
whenever she wishes.

1194
01:26:14,748 --> 01:26:16,453
Thank you, I'll let her know.

1195
01:26:16,789 --> 01:26:18,495
Claire? lt's me.

1196
01:26:33,832 --> 01:26:38,574
Claire! I've brought lunch.

1197
01:26:48,210 --> 01:26:49,751
Claire!

1198
01:26:51,376 --> 01:26:56,201
Claire, answer me!

1199
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,460
Claire!

1200
01:27:01,172 --> 01:27:02,710
Claire!

1201
01:27:04,547 --> 01:27:06,087
Claire!

1202
01:27:11,713 --> 01:27:13,289
Are you down here?

1203
01:27:18,797 --> 01:27:21,500
Claire!

1204
01:27:57,220 --> 01:27:59,211
Have any of you seen a woman

1205
01:27:59,386 --> 01:28:02,302
going out the gate
of the villa across the road?

1206
01:28:02,471 --> 01:28:03,929
No, I can't say I have.

1207
01:28:04,262 --> 01:28:07,295
Has anybody seen someone
coming out of the villa?

1208
01:28:07,636 --> 01:28:10,387
A young woman.
Medium height, light hair.

1209
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:13,210
- A bit pale.
- I think I saw her.

1210
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:14,833
I didn't see her go out,

1211
01:28:15,014 --> 01:28:17,219
but she was walking away
from the gate.

1212
01:28:17,557 --> 01:28:19,842
- When?
- This morning at breakfast.

1213
01:28:20,181 --> 01:28:23,345
- What else can you tell me?
- She seemed a bit weird.

1214
01:28:23,681 --> 01:28:28,007
- Weird? Which way did she go?
- That way. Towards the park.

1215
01:28:28,348 --> 01:28:30,091
231.

1216
01:28:30,432 --> 01:28:33,681
Idiot!

1217
01:28:35,849 --> 01:28:38,055
- Hello? Virgil?
- She's gone.

1218
01:28:38,225 --> 01:28:40,844
- Who? What's going on?
- Claire's disappeared.

1219
01:28:41,017 --> 01:28:43,885
I've looked.
They saw her leave this morning.

1220
01:28:44,225 --> 01:28:46,548
- Do you want me to come over?
- Please.

1221
01:28:49,434 --> 01:28:50,976
Has this happened before?

1222
01:28:51,143 --> 01:28:53,299
She never even appeared
at the windows.

1223
01:28:53,476 --> 01:28:55,019
Just behind the shutters.

1224
01:28:55,352 --> 01:28:57,592
Did she have friends
she could go to?

1225
01:28:57,937 --> 01:29:02,225
She'd talk to people on her
computer under different names.

1226
01:29:02,561 --> 01:29:06,141
- She can't have gone far.
- Let's hope so.

1227
01:29:06,477 --> 01:29:08,516
I've already been round three times.

1228
01:29:11,146 --> 01:29:12,937
- Hello?
- Mr. Oldman.

1229
01:29:13,105 --> 01:29:15,889
- Listen, has Miss lbbetson phoned?
- No.

1230
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:18,765
- lf she calls, let me know.
- I will.

1231
01:29:18,940 --> 01:29:22,718
Mr. Oldman, I wouldn't like
to think you'd forgotten.

1232
01:29:22,895 --> 01:29:24,770
Forgotten what?

1233
01:29:32,191 --> 01:29:35,603
- There he is. Here we go.
- Lot number one.

1234
01:29:35,941 --> 01:29:39,981
Late Baroque, Venetian,
mid-18th-century mirror.

1235
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:42,271
Inlaid wood with gold leaf,

1236
01:29:42,608 --> 01:29:45,606
with adornments,
floral motifs and festoons.

1237
01:29:47,816 --> 01:29:49,357
Upper frame richly...

1238
01:29:57,610 --> 01:30:00,359
Inlaid wood with gold leaf,
with adornments,

1239
01:30:00,527 --> 01:30:02,270
floral motifs and festoons.

1240
01:30:02,446 --> 01:30:04,814
Upper frame richly
engraved with whirls.

1241
01:30:04,986 --> 01:30:06,444
Can we say 130,000 euros?

1242
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:09,147
140,000 euros.

1243
01:30:09,486 --> 01:30:11,809
150,000 euros.
Gentleman on my left.

1244
01:30:11,987 --> 01:30:14,026
160,000 euros. Lady up the back.

1245
01:30:14,405 --> 01:30:18,528
170,000 euros.
180,000 euros on the telephone.

1246
01:30:18,863 --> 01:30:22,443
200,000 euros.
Gentleman on my left in the room.

1247
01:30:22,613 --> 01:30:24,818
220,000 euros.

1248
01:30:24,989 --> 01:30:28,106
250,000 euros on the tele...

1249
01:30:28,448 --> 01:30:31,482
Still nothing, Mr. Oldman.
I'll keep looking.

1250
01:30:31,658 --> 01:30:34,276
- Robert's looking further afield.
- Alright.

1251
01:30:34,448 --> 01:30:37,233
- I'll call you later.
- Alright

1252
01:30:39,615 --> 01:30:42,318
- He's gone crazy.
- 280,000.

1253
01:30:42,657 --> 01:30:44,778
310,000. Any more?

1254
01:30:45,658 --> 01:30:47,947
Sold!

1255
01:30:48,283 --> 01:30:52,149
I'm doing the rounds
of the hospitals, but there's nothing.

1256
01:30:52,327 --> 01:30:53,523
Just keep looking.

1257
01:30:53,701 --> 01:30:56,319
- We'll find her. I'll keep in touch.
- Thanks.

1258
01:30:57,368 --> 01:30:58,944
Lot number 2.

1259
01:30:59,119 --> 01:31:02,033
A 17th-century
Fassadenschranke wardrobe

1260
01:31:02,201 --> 01:31:04,028
in walnut, maple, oak and ash.

1261
01:31:04,203 --> 01:31:06,871
The carved frame
surmounts an inlaid stripe,

1262
01:31:07,204 --> 01:31:10,486
and two doors engraved
with architectural motifs,

1263
01:31:10,829 --> 01:31:12,819
surrounded by carvings of fruit.

1264
01:31:13,162 --> 01:31:16,280
Three spiralled,
tapered columns flank the doors.

1265
01:31:16,618 --> 01:31:19,654
The lower body has two drawers.

1266
01:31:22,664 --> 01:31:23,861
And um...

1267
01:31:28,414 --> 01:31:31,530
There's nothing for it
but to call the police.

1268
01:31:31,705 --> 01:31:34,574
It'll be all over the papers.
They'll drag me into it.

1269
01:31:34,746 --> 01:31:36,206
Let's wait a bit longer.

1270
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:38,117
What do you hope will happen?

1271
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:41,787
That she'll come back... or turn up.

1272
01:31:43,125 --> 01:31:45,793
Or they'll find out where she is.

1273
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:49,702
Someone with her problems
doesn't just disappear into thin air.

1274
01:31:49,875 --> 01:31:51,948
Well, that depends.

1275
01:31:52,291 --> 01:31:54,165
No matter how deeply rooted it is,

1276
01:31:54,334 --> 01:31:57,119
sometimes a phobia
can just disappear by itself.

1277
01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:59,118
So, why did she run away?

1278
01:31:59,294 --> 01:32:01,414
Maybe something happened
between you

1279
01:32:01,751 --> 01:32:04,322
that drove her
to take that kind of decision.

1280
01:32:04,501 --> 01:32:07,785
You know perfectly well
that's impossible.

1281
01:32:07,961 --> 01:32:10,795
You're the only person
who knows everything

1282
01:32:10,963 --> 01:32:12,667
that happened between us.

1283
01:32:16,212 --> 01:32:18,452
Excuse me a minute.

1284
01:32:37,924 --> 01:32:40,922
- Hello?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Oldman.

1285
01:32:41,091 --> 01:32:43,496
I've called
all the publishers in existence

1286
01:32:43,674 --> 01:32:45,711
but none of them knows
who she is.

1287
01:32:45,882 --> 01:32:48,122
They said that often
even they don't know

1288
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:51,464
the identity of authors
who use pseudonyms.

1289
01:32:51,801 --> 01:32:53,957
I'd never have guessed that you

1290
01:32:54,134 --> 01:32:56,587
would have ended up
in a mess like this.

1291
01:32:56,759 --> 01:33:00,540
- I don't know how I can help you.
- All you had to do was listen.

1292
01:33:00,885 --> 01:33:03,041
Ah.

1293
01:33:03,219 --> 01:33:07,675
Considering the lady's illness,
it seems highly unrealistic

1294
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:09,836
that she's just run away.

1295
01:33:11,136 --> 01:33:15,544
I'd say, I don't know,
she'd been abducted or something.

1296
01:33:15,887 --> 01:33:18,803
That's not likely.
I don't think she had any enemies.

1297
01:33:19,138 --> 01:33:22,503
It could be somebody became
so besotted with her

1298
01:33:22,679 --> 01:33:24,256
and carried her off by force.

1299
01:33:24,596 --> 01:33:28,010
- But who?
- I've had my doubts about Robert.

1300
01:33:28,347 --> 01:33:29,377
The young guy?

1301
01:33:29,721 --> 01:33:32,721
The way you describe him,
he doesn't seem the type.

1302
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:36,221
From the literary point of view,
he fits the bill.

1303
01:33:37,349 --> 01:33:39,385
The young knight
rescuing the damsel

1304
01:33:39,557 --> 01:33:43,005
from the clutches of the old man
incapable of love.

1305
01:33:43,349 --> 01:33:46,098
Literature, exactly.

1306
01:33:46,431 --> 01:33:48,422
Don't go overboard, Virgil.

1307
01:33:48,766 --> 01:33:52,050
She could have had her own reasons
for disappearing.

1308
01:33:52,391 --> 01:33:54,881
I can't imagine what reasons.

1309
01:33:55,227 --> 01:33:58,425
Recently, she's been experiencing
emotions and feelings

1310
01:33:58,601 --> 01:34:00,887
that are incompatible with flight.

1311
01:34:01,225 --> 01:34:03,216
I wouldn't be so sure,
if I were you.

1312
01:34:03,559 --> 01:34:06,048
Human emotions
are like works of art.

1313
01:34:06,393 --> 01:34:08,101
They can be forged.

1314
01:34:08,269 --> 01:34:12,181
They seem just like the original,
but they're a forgery.

1315
01:34:14,729 --> 01:34:18,674
- Forgery?
- Everything can be faked, Virgil.

1316
01:34:19,019 --> 01:34:21,970
Joy, pain, hate.

1317
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:25,976
Illness, recovery.

1318
01:34:27,521 --> 01:34:29,595
Even love.

1319
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,183
- Hello?
- Listen.

1320
01:34:49,357 --> 01:34:51,894
There's something
that hadn't occurred to us.

1321
01:34:52,066 --> 01:34:56,106
Are you sure there are
no other secret rooms in the villa?

1322
01:34:56,275 --> 01:34:58,395
I don't remember
any other doors

1323
01:34:58,566 --> 01:35:00,772
like the one to Miss lbbetson's room.

1324
01:35:02,192 --> 01:35:04,433
Claire!

1325
01:35:04,609 --> 01:35:09,315
The only place we haven't looked at
is the attic... if you want?

1326
01:35:15,277 --> 01:35:18,111
Did you know
that Miss Claire was a writer?

1327
01:35:18,277 --> 01:35:20,850
I heard her parents
talk about it.

1328
01:35:21,028 --> 01:35:24,062
She used a pseudonym
for her books.

1329
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:28,147
I never knew that.
I've never seen the books.

1330
01:35:28,487 --> 01:35:30,228
She never wanted them here.

1331
01:35:30,570 --> 01:35:31,945
Claire!

1332
01:35:33,239 --> 01:35:36,521
We're wasting time.
There are no other secret rooms.

1333
01:35:36,698 --> 01:35:38,273
You've come back.

1334
01:35:38,447 --> 01:35:40,273
- We should...
- Quiet!

1335
01:35:40,615 --> 01:35:41,942
You've...

1336
01:35:43,114 --> 01:35:44,524
You've come back.

1337
01:35:44,698 --> 01:35:46,571
You've...

1338
01:35:48,615 --> 01:35:50,441
You've come back.

1339
01:35:50,781 --> 01:35:52,155
You've...

1340
01:35:52,324 --> 01:35:53,983
Claire?

1341
01:35:59,325 --> 01:36:03,024
Claire, I can feel you're there.
Answer me.

1342
01:36:05,493 --> 01:36:06,985
You've come back.

1343
01:36:09,827 --> 01:36:12,907
- You've come back.
- Of course I have.

1344
01:36:14,244 --> 01:36:15,902
Were you afraid I wouldn't?

1345
01:36:27,870 --> 01:36:30,822
I thought
you'd abandoned me.

1346
01:36:30,995 --> 01:36:34,492
- Like last time.
- Last time?

1347
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:37,663
When we got back from Prague.

1348
01:36:40,832 --> 01:36:42,157
Claire.

1349
01:37:04,083 --> 01:37:06,157
I will never abandon you.

1350
01:37:09,710 --> 01:37:13,240
I'd been happy in Prague
in that very odd restaurant.

1351
01:37:15,919 --> 01:37:18,834
I was there with my first
and only boyfriend.

1352
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:22,626
He was older than me.

1353
01:37:27,503 --> 01:37:30,206
When we got back
from that excursion,

1354
01:37:30,379 --> 01:37:33,293
one afternoon,
we were walking in the city centre.

1355
01:37:36,131 --> 01:37:38,204
A car crashed into us.

1356
01:37:39,380 --> 01:37:43,126
When I came to,
he wasn't there anymore.

1357
01:38:04,634 --> 01:38:09,008
I went back home
and I never went out again.

1358
01:38:37,388 --> 01:38:39,545
I've never slept
with a woman.

1359
01:38:39,889 --> 01:38:42,886
In fact, I didn't close my eyes.

1360
01:38:43,221 --> 01:38:46,719
I spent the whole night
just looking at her.

1361
01:38:47,055 --> 01:38:51,299
- It was wonderful.
- Well, welcome to the grown-up club.

1362
01:38:51,641 --> 01:38:54,424
You've succeeded
in making her fall in love.

1363
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:58,012
I had a good teacher.

1364
01:39:00,516 --> 01:39:02,672
I understood where the dwarf hid.

1365
01:39:03,016 --> 01:39:05,884
Look, there must have been
a sunken pedestal here.

1366
01:39:06,226 --> 01:39:07,850
He would crouch in there

1367
01:39:08,018 --> 01:39:10,422
and his voice would reverberate
in the body.

1368
01:39:10,601 --> 01:39:12,390
It must have made an impression.

1369
01:39:12,725 --> 01:39:14,846
Do you think love can be faked?

1370
01:39:19,602 --> 01:39:22,434
In keeping with what you say
about art forgeries,

1371
01:39:22,771 --> 01:39:25,092
I'd say it can't be completely faked.

1372
01:39:25,436 --> 01:39:27,474
If one could say love is a work of art.

1373
01:39:27,812 --> 01:39:30,299
It'd be amazing if it were,
wouldn't it?

1374
01:39:30,478 --> 01:39:32,350
lt could be sold off at an auction.

1375
01:39:32,686 --> 01:39:36,348
The highest bidder could relive
the greatest love stories.

1376
01:39:36,521 --> 01:39:39,009
I hope I haven't destroyed
your love story.

1377
01:39:39,355 --> 01:39:41,261
No problem. No problem.

1378
01:39:41,606 --> 01:39:44,010
A new valve, two hinges, one fuse...

1379
01:39:44,187 --> 01:39:46,643
It'll be good as new.
Just like the first day.

1380
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:49,303
What do you think
you're going to do now?

1381
01:39:51,272 --> 01:39:53,596
I want to coax her out.

1382
01:39:53,939 --> 01:39:57,804
Yeah, I wouldn't push too hard
if I were you.

1383
01:39:58,149 --> 01:40:00,223
She's too fragile.

1384
01:40:00,566 --> 01:40:04,939
You'll see. When you least expect it,
things will fall into place naturally.

1385
01:40:20,110 --> 01:40:24,019
No!

1386
01:41:12,326 --> 01:41:16,486
Hello? Hello?

1387
01:41:16,659 --> 01:41:19,494
Virgil? Virgil, is that you?

1388
01:41:51,872 --> 01:41:54,540
Virgil! Virgil!

1389
01:42:00,705 --> 01:42:02,615
Virgil?

1390
01:42:23,249 --> 01:42:25,041
Help! Help!

1391
01:42:26,377 --> 01:42:28,912
- Hold it up!
- It is up!

1392
01:42:58,172 --> 01:43:00,922
Why don't you love it?

1393
01:43:01,089 --> 01:43:04,920
I've never felt it to be a real home.
More like a hotel.

1394
01:43:05,258 --> 01:43:07,378
You come home a night,
sleep if you can.

1395
01:43:07,550 --> 01:43:09,919
Next morning,
you're off somewhere else.

1396
01:43:11,257 --> 01:43:13,331
Let's go back inside.

1397
01:43:14,715 --> 01:43:18,498
Seems to have been planned
to welcome a lot of people.

1398
01:43:18,676 --> 01:43:22,040
Yes, but the plan was never realised.

1399
01:43:22,217 --> 01:43:24,884
Except for the inaugural reception.

1400
01:43:25,218 --> 01:43:27,173
I was so distrustful of other people

1401
01:43:27,343 --> 01:43:32,047
that I kept them away from
the perimeter of my personal hotel.

1402
01:43:34,344 --> 01:43:36,215
I was a fool.

1403
01:43:37,678 --> 01:43:39,255
Even now, I still get upset

1404
01:43:39,429 --> 01:43:42,711
when I see the housekeeper
and the maids walking about.

1405
01:43:42,886 --> 01:43:44,961
After dinner, I send them home.

1406
01:43:46,513 --> 01:43:49,047
I wasn't wrong when I said
we were very similar.

1407
01:43:49,221 --> 01:43:50,962
Yes, you were right.

1408
01:43:52,637 --> 01:43:54,712
And thanks to you, I understood.

1409
01:44:12,932 --> 01:44:15,551
- Where are you taking me?
- You'll soon find out.

1410
01:44:17,767 --> 01:44:21,676
Close your eyes.
I'll tell you when you can open them.

1411
01:44:30,269 --> 01:44:33,016
Don't be afraid. I'll lead the way.

1412
01:44:33,186 --> 01:44:36,467
I never liked games
where you had to close your eyes.

1413
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:47,301
- Mind the step.
- Gently, please.

1414
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:52,764
We're almost there.

1415
01:44:54,396 --> 01:44:55,805
Stop now.

1416
01:44:58,105 --> 01:44:59,812
Open your eyes.

1417
01:45:07,647 --> 01:45:09,353
I don't believe it.

1418
01:45:12,856 --> 01:45:14,350
It's overwhelming.

1419
01:45:14,982 --> 01:45:17,307
I've been collecting them
all my life.

1420
01:45:19,318 --> 01:45:22,397
So, I'm not the first.
You have had other women

1421
01:45:22,732 --> 01:45:25,102
Yes.

1422
01:45:25,275 --> 01:45:27,846
I've loved them all
and they loved me back.

1423
01:45:28,193 --> 01:45:30,315
They taught me to wait for you.

1424
01:45:32,152 --> 01:45:33,977
And now that you're here,

1425
01:45:34,153 --> 01:45:36,356
we'd like you to come
and live with us

1426
01:45:36,527 --> 01:45:38,980
and make this beautiful hotel
your home.

1427
01:45:40,527 --> 01:45:42,067
Oh, Virgil.

1428
01:45:44,735 --> 01:45:47,226
If anything should ever happen to us,

1429
01:45:47,404 --> 01:45:49,477
I want you to know that I do love you.

1430
01:45:51,695 --> 01:45:53,319
I love you too.

1431
01:45:53,487 --> 01:45:57,150
The catalogue for the sale
of the paintings and furniture

1432
01:45:57,322 --> 01:45:58,813
of Ibbetson Villa is ready.

1433
01:45:58,987 --> 01:46:02,437
Congratulations. It's a lovely volume.
About time!

1434
01:46:04,113 --> 01:46:07,148
I wonder who'll buy this wonderful
stuff... Oh, sorry.

1435
01:46:07,324 --> 01:46:10,653
I can't conceal my anxiety to know
what you think about it.

1436
01:46:21,491 --> 01:46:23,032
Well, don't you like it?

1437
01:46:25,741 --> 01:46:27,116
No, it's just that...

1438
01:46:29,117 --> 01:46:31,902
...ever since I decided
to come and live with you...

1439
01:46:33,494 --> 01:46:37,190
...I've been thinking I... don't want
to sell anymore.

1440
01:46:39,577 --> 01:46:41,947
I'd like to leave everything
the way it was.

1441
01:46:48,786 --> 01:46:49,863
I understand.

1442
01:46:50,911 --> 01:46:51,941
Are you sure?

1443
01:46:52,787 --> 01:46:55,322
Believe me, if I were you,
I'd do the same thing.

1444
01:46:57,495 --> 01:47:00,861
Tomorrow, everything
will be back in its place.

1445
01:47:03,912 --> 01:47:05,076
Alright, Virgil!

1446
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:13,948
To the most tortured and most
fortunate catalogue of my career.

1447
01:47:14,124 --> 01:47:15,782
That's saying something.

1448
01:47:15,956 --> 01:47:17,993
- Here, here.
- Cheers.

1449
01:47:19,582 --> 01:47:21,987
And since you've become
my family...

1450
01:47:23,873 --> 01:47:26,577
...I too have an important
announcement to make.

1451
01:47:27,418 --> 01:47:29,621
Next week,
I have an auction in London.

1452
01:47:29,959 --> 01:47:33,324
It will be the finest of my career
and the very last.

1453
01:47:39,043 --> 01:47:41,874
They say he's been seen
recently in female company.

1454
01:47:42,043 --> 01:47:43,786
- Who? Virgil?
- Yes.

1455
01:47:43,962 --> 01:47:48,086
It's finally come home to him that the
worst sexual perversion is chastity.

1456
01:47:49,295 --> 01:47:51,913
How is it going
onstage for the last time?

1457
01:47:52,087 --> 01:47:55,949
I've never felt better. There's
a whiff of anticipation in the air.

1458
01:47:56,129 --> 01:47:58,416
All my colleagues
have come to see me off.

1459
01:47:58,587 --> 01:47:59,962
That's nice of them.

1460
01:48:00,130 --> 01:48:03,958
This affection is because they won't
have to put up with me anymore.

1461
01:48:06,297 --> 01:48:09,544
Anyhow, I'm happy, Claire.
I just wish you were here.

1462
01:48:09,713 --> 01:48:11,172
Me too.

1463
01:48:11,339 --> 01:48:14,788
But I'm not ready to travel yet.
I got dizzy in the car yesterday.

1464
01:48:14,964 --> 01:48:18,496
Don't let it get to you. We have
all the time in the world to travel.

1465
01:48:18,673 --> 01:48:20,829
- We're ready, Mr. Oldman.
- I'm coming.

1466
01:48:21,715 --> 01:48:23,919
Have you heard
from our young friends?

1467
01:48:24,092 --> 01:48:26,875
Constantly.
I'm never left on my own.

1468
01:48:27,049 --> 01:48:29,088
Good. Give them my love.

1469
01:48:30,258 --> 01:48:32,925
- I can hear you've got to go.
- Yes.

1470
01:48:34,009 --> 01:48:37,541
- But I can't wait to get back home.
- Good luck, my darling.

1471
01:48:38,510 --> 01:48:40,964
12,100,000.

1472
01:48:44,136 --> 01:48:45,544
Any more?

1473
01:48:47,426 --> 01:48:49,832
12,300,000.

1474
01:48:51,137 --> 01:48:52,677
Any advance?

1475
01:48:55,679 --> 01:48:58,168
12,500,000 on the telephone.

1476
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:01,670
Any more?

1477
01:49:01,845 --> 01:49:04,463
All done at 12,500,000.

1478
01:49:04,804 --> 01:49:08,301
Sold for 12,500,000.

1479
01:49:09,638 --> 01:49:13,005
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.

1480
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:28,680
- Good to see you.
- Thank you. Not a bad price.

1481
01:49:29,016 --> 01:49:31,172
Can I say hello to you in public?

1482
01:49:31,349 --> 01:49:33,339
Oh, Billy.

1483
01:49:33,682 --> 01:49:37,808
You were fantastic, my friend! I'm
happy for you. I'm going to miss you.

1484
01:49:38,142 --> 01:49:40,347
You say it like
we'll never meet again.

1485
01:49:40,767 --> 01:49:42,261
Of course we will.

1486
01:49:42,434 --> 01:49:45,965
But I'm feeling nostalgic
thinking about all our exploits.

1487
01:49:46,685 --> 01:49:48,592
- You'll get over it.
- Virgil?

1488
01:49:49,727 --> 01:49:52,512
To remind you of
what a great artist I could've been

1489
01:49:52,852 --> 01:49:56,717
if only you'd believed in me,
I've sent you one of my paintings.

1490
01:49:56,895 --> 01:49:58,685
I promise I won't burn it.

1491
01:50:08,980 --> 01:50:10,520
Claire.

1492
01:50:12,063 --> 01:50:13,605
Claire, I'm back!

1493
01:50:15,605 --> 01:50:17,147
Hello?

1494
01:50:20,356 --> 01:50:23,224
- Have you seen Miss Claire?
- No, sir.

1495
01:50:23,606 --> 01:50:25,148
Claire?

1496
01:50:26,774 --> 01:50:28,184
Where are you?

1497
01:50:29,943 --> 01:50:31,104
Claire?

1498
01:50:32,317 --> 01:50:35,101
Mr. Oldman,
she must have gone out.

1499
01:50:35,442 --> 01:50:36,899
It was the same yesterday.

1500
01:50:37,066 --> 01:50:40,397
Sarah and Robert came to get her,
then came back for lunch.

1501
01:50:40,567 --> 01:50:41,810
Alright.

1502
01:52:05,286 --> 01:52:07,195
"There is always

1503
01:52:07,371 --> 01:52:10,404
something authentic
concealed in every forgery."

1504
01:52:10,579 --> 01:52:13,992
I couldn't agree more.
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

1505
01:52:14,162 --> 01:52:16,368
"There is always something
authentic

1506
01:52:16,537 --> 01:52:18,327
concealed in every forgery."

1507
01:52:18,497 --> 01:52:20,370
I couldn't agree more.

1508
01:52:20,539 --> 01:52:23,158
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

1509
01:52:23,330 --> 01:52:25,536
"There is always something
authentic

1510
01:52:25,707 --> 01:52:27,448
concealed in every forgery."

1511
01:52:27,624 --> 01:52:29,496
I couldn't agree more.

1512
01:52:29,664 --> 01:52:32,284
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

1513
01:52:32,456 --> 01:52:34,578
"There is always something
authentic

1514
01:52:34,748 --> 01:52:36,456
concealed in every forgery."

1515
01:52:36,791 --> 01:52:40,787
I couldn't agree more.
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

1516
01:52:40,959 --> 01:52:43,116
"There is always something
authentic

1517
01:52:43,294 --> 01:52:44,999
concealed in every forgery."

1518
01:52:45,168 --> 01:52:47,205
I couldn't agree more.

1519
01:52:47,375 --> 01:52:49,412
That's why I'll miss you, Mr. Oldman.

1520
01:52:49,584 --> 01:52:53,033
"There is always something
authentic concealed in every..."

1521
01:53:09,544 --> 01:53:13,539
Good morning, Mr. Oldman.
We have visitors today.

1522
01:53:13,711 --> 01:53:16,831
Isn't this nice?
Look who's come to see you!

1523
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:26,538
How are you, Mr. Oldman?

1524
01:53:31,172 --> 01:53:32,915
I've brought your mail,

1525
01:53:33,258 --> 01:53:36,540
some newspapers
and a few magazines.

1526
01:55:03,435 --> 01:55:07,299
A few days ago, they brought
some furniture to the villa opposite.

1527
01:55:10,854 --> 01:55:12,016
Did you notice?

1528
01:55:12,812 --> 01:55:15,680
I think so,
but I don't see much from in here.

1529
01:55:16,395 --> 01:55:17,425
Ask her.

1530
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:26,890
Claire?

1531
01:55:27,063 --> 01:55:29,518
Listen to what
this gentleman wants to say.

1532
01:55:30,649 --> 01:55:31,679
Yes.

1533
01:55:33,064 --> 01:55:34,474
And the day after,

1534
01:55:34,649 --> 01:55:37,896
other workmen came
and took everything away again.

1535
01:55:40,024 --> 01:55:41,564
The day after?

1536
01:55:42,857 --> 01:55:46,804
In 18 months,
three deliveries and three removals.

1537
01:55:49,777 --> 01:55:52,062
I was here a while ago.

1538
01:55:53,359 --> 01:55:55,563
- Do you remember?
- Nine.

1539
01:55:58,025 --> 01:56:01,974
- What do you mean?
- You've been here nine times.

1540
01:56:04,028 --> 01:56:05,485
Today makes 10.

1541
01:56:05,820 --> 01:56:09,433
I was wondering if you saw
a woman leave the villa.

1542
01:56:10,693 --> 01:56:13,894
Medium height, light hair,
a bit pale?

1543
01:56:15,194 --> 01:56:19,060
- Yes.
- That time was 231.

1544
01:56:20,657 --> 01:56:22,112
Are you sure?

1545
01:56:22,446 --> 01:56:24,105
Then another six.

1546
01:56:24,948 --> 01:56:29,899
In a year and a half,
I saw her go out 237 times.

1547
01:56:30,279 --> 01:56:31,690
What did I say?

1548
01:56:31,864 --> 01:56:34,318
She's a phenomenon,
remembers everything.

1549
01:56:36,365 --> 01:56:37,906
It's not possible.

1550
01:56:40,447 --> 01:56:42,569
You were at the villa 63 times.

1551
01:56:42,908 --> 01:56:46,818
36 during the day and 27 at night,

1552
01:56:47,157 --> 01:56:49,480
excluding the night
of the accident.

1553
01:56:50,949 --> 01:56:54,363
- One, four, four.
- One, four, four?

1554
01:56:54,701 --> 01:56:56,941
The telephone number
for the ambulance.

1555
01:56:58,409 --> 01:56:59,986
The villa is free now.

1556
01:57:00,368 --> 01:57:03,284
If you're interested,
I'll get you a good deal.

1557
01:57:04,911 --> 01:57:07,527
- Who owns it?
- Me.

1558
01:57:08,744 --> 01:57:10,818
But I don't know what to do with it.

1559
01:57:11,910 --> 01:57:14,578
I often rent it out to cinema people.

1560
01:57:15,494 --> 01:57:16,869
Cinema people?

1561
01:57:17,454 --> 01:57:20,404
For the past two years,
it's been taken by the engineer

1562
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:23,115
who does the lift
that takes me up to my house.

1563
01:57:23,912 --> 01:57:25,619
He's really nice, that boy.

1564
01:57:26,539 --> 01:57:28,196
He can do anything.

1565
01:57:28,371 --> 01:57:30,862
There's nothing he can't fix.

1566
01:57:31,454 --> 01:57:34,787
And he's always kissing me.

1567
01:57:34,955 --> 01:57:36,747
Bringing me flowers.

1568
02:00:22,102 --> 02:00:25,884
The Paris Express
is now arriving at platform seven.

1569
02:00:27,353 --> 02:00:29,060
Your attention, please.

1570
02:00:29,228 --> 02:00:32,062
The Berlin-Prague Arrow
is running 40 minutes late

1571
02:00:32,228 --> 02:00:33,426
due to fog on the line.

1572
02:00:35,272 --> 02:00:36,812
Come in, sir.

1573
02:00:38,146 --> 02:00:40,517
We furnished it
exactly as you requested.

1574
02:00:41,939 --> 02:00:44,428
And tomorrow, your trunks
will be delivered.

1575
02:00:44,606 --> 02:00:47,723
And later, I'll pass by
with a copy of your contract.

1576
02:00:48,066 --> 02:00:51,432
If there's anything else,
please don't hesitate to call.

1577
02:00:57,899 --> 02:00:59,441
Oh, Virgil.

1578
02:01:00,858 --> 02:01:05,066
If anything should happen to us,
I want you to know that I do love you.

1579
02:03:28,878 --> 02:03:30,951
Are you on your own, sir?

1580
02:03:41,588 --> 02:03:44,292
No. I'm waiting for someone.
