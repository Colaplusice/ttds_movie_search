1
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:05,270
Hey, okay ...
now ...

2
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:08,873
let's go again.

3
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:15,207
Which one's this, number9?
- Yeah, number 9.  Bright eyes.

4
00:03:16,736 --> 00:03:18,157
Are you watching this?

5
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:23,023
This, this is unbelieveable.

6
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:28,498
Oh, my God.

7
00:03:29,511 --> 00:03:31,242
Oh, my God.

8
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:36,843
How many moves was that?
- 20.

9
00:03:37,095 --> 00:03:40,259
The perfect score is 15.
God, what, what are you giving her?

10
00:03:40,352 --> 00:03:41,605
Hey, give me that video!

11
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:49,839
Chimp number 9, just one dose.

12
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:52,495
Couldn't I see you later?
- We're good to go.

13
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,876
I'm going to call you back. Yeah,
all right.  Thanks, Bye.

14
00:03:55,004 --> 00:03:56,701
112, it works.

15
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:00,461
On just the one primate?
- One is all we need.

16
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,264
Full cognitive recovery.

17
00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:03,182
We're ready.

18
00:04:03,232 --> 00:04:05,858
Look, are you sure you're
not rushing this?

19
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:09,250
I've been working on this for
five and a half years.

20
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:12,663
The data is clear.
We're ready, Steven.

21
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:15,036
All I need is your approval
for human trials.

22
00:04:15,142 --> 00:04:17,265
Oh, for this, you're going to need
the Board's approval.

23
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:19,790
There's a lot of money riding
 on this, Will.

24
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:22,831
You only get one shot.
- One shot is all I need.

25
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:26,016
[sighs]

26
00:04:27,088 --> 00:04:29,714
All right. I'll need to see
all the research.

27
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:30,773
You got it!

28
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:32,582
Oh, and Will ...
- Yeah?

29
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:35,236
Keep your personal emotions
out of it.

30
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:37,834
These people invest in results,
not dreams.

31
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,365
Okay!

32
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:46,964
Meet chimp 9. Here she's tasking at
what is called the Lucas Tower.

33
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:50,133
The object of which is to move the tower
from peg to peg

34
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:53,813
without placing a larger block
on top of a smaller block.

35
00:04:53,948 --> 00:04:58,005
As expected, she was unable 
to complete the puzzle at all.

36
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:04,157
Then, we gave her what we call,
ALZ-112, a gene therapy

37
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:09,102
that allows the brain to create its
own cells in order to repair itself.

38
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:12,116
In biology, this is
called neurogenesis.

39
00:05:12,273 --> 00:05:14,072
Here, at GEN-SYS,

40
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:17,745
we call it a cure to Alzheimer's.

41
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:24,068
Donnie, you get her ready?
- She's got stage fright.

42
00:05:24,162 --> 00:05:25,534
Is that what it is?

43
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,897
Hey, ape.

44
00:05:36,217 --> 00:05:37,591
She's gonna break my arm!

45
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:40,008
Bright Eyes!  
Let go!

46
00:05:43,486 --> 00:05:45,019
Are you all right?

47
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:54,083
We're ready to move
on to the next phase.

48
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:56,376
Human trials.

49
00:05:57,492 --> 00:06:01,129
Here you go, Bright Eyes.  
It's your favorite fizzy soda. 

50
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,239
Come on, let's go, Donnie.

51
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:03,767
We should have her downstairs already.

52
00:06:04,021 --> 00:06:06,664
Okay. Good girl!

53
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:10,022
Come on out, girl, that's right.

54
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:12,874
That's for you.

55
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:17,972
Got her!

56
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:20,236
Jesus!

57
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:24,669
Donnie, open the cage!
Open up! Open up!

58
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:28,473
Going to sedate her!

59
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,109
 No, no!
- Get the door!

60
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:39,388
No, no! Hold it! Now!

61
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:41,635
Call help! Donnie, Donnie!

62
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,770
There have been absolutely no side 
effects associated

63
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,204
with 112, with one exception.

64
00:06:47,203 --> 00:06:48,151
For some reason,

65
00:06:48,245 --> 00:06:51,369
the chimps irises exhibit 
flecks of green.

66
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:54,204
Actually, we first noticed it in chimp 9,

67
00:06:54,254 --> 00:06:56,378
hence her nickname, Bright Eyes.

68
00:06:56,468 --> 00:06:58,122
You'll see when we bring her in.

69
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,438
Move!

70
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:07,236
In theory, this therapy
can be used

71
00:07:07,324 --> 00:07:10,320
to treat a wide range
 of brain disorders.

72
00:07:15,492 --> 00:07:16,950
It's virtually limitless.

73
00:07:17,059 --> 00:07:19,433
As are the potential profits.

74
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,313
which is why we are confident that

75
00:07:22,363 --> 00:07:25,467
you will vote to approve human trials.

76
00:07:31,488 --> 00:07:33,202
No, no, no!

77
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:54,922
Mr. Jacobs, Mr. Jacobs I am begging you,

78
00:07:54,972 --> 00:07:56,846
I am begging you, not to do this.

79
00:07:56,956 --> 00:07:58,048
Look, it costs a small fortune to

80
00:07:58,098 --> 00:07:59,360
run lab workups on all of those chimps

81
00:07:59,484 --> 00:08:02,153
only to tell me what I already know,

82
00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:04,199
that they are contaminated.

83
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:05,397
There are lives at stake here.

84
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,542
These, these are animals
with personalities,

85
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:08,533
with attachments.

86
00:08:09,925 --> 00:08:12,113
 Attachments?
- Yeah.

87
00:08:12,393 --> 00:08:15,216
I run a a business,
not a petting zoo.

88
00:08:15,778 --> 00:08:18,722
Find the most cost effective way
to put those apes down.

89
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,575
I can't do that.

90
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,202
You're the chimp handler.

91
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:22,351
Handle it.

92
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:24,456
Steven!

93
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,194
Well, that was fun!

94
00:08:26,243 --> 00:08:27,575
They've taken the 112.

95
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,165
Board has rejected your proposal.

96
00:08:29,215 --> 00:08:30,960
They've chosen to advance other programs.

97
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,780
Well, there must be something
that you can do.

98
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,252
Yes. There is, I could fire you.

99
00:08:35,406 --> 00:08:37,448
Believe me, we talked about it.

100
00:08:37,543 --> 00:08:39,806
We have five years of conclusive data.

101
00:08:39,912 --> 00:08:41,275
Parade all the data you want,

102
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,421
you will never convince anyone
to invest another dime.

103
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:47,882
This drug has the potential
to save lives!

104
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:49,939
Bankrupt this company, more like.

105
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:52,858
I swear, you know everything
about the human brain

106
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:55,578
except the way it works.

107
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,571
Go back to the drawing board
on the 112.

108
00:09:01,664 --> 00:09:03,990
Start again in
molecular development.

109
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,359
Find a way to get there
before someone else does.

110
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:10,343
And, clean up this mess.

111
00:09:27,582 --> 00:09:29,088
Franklin!

112
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:39,502
It's very small. She must have been

113
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:41,352
pregnant when we brought her in.

114
00:09:42,085 --> 00:09:43,672
So that's why ...

115
00:09:43,722 --> 00:09:47,205
She wasn't being aggressive. 
She was just being protective.

116
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:49,328
She thought we were going to
hurt her baby.

117
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:54,024
I would take it myself,

118
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:58,123
but my brother-in-law works for security.
He'd rat me out in a seceond.

119
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,770
What, you want me to take it home?

120
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,617
I can't take care of a monkey.

121
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:05,380
He's not a monkey! He's an ape.
- Franklin ...

122
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,862
You know, it's just for a couple days until

123
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:08,177
 I find a sanctuary.  That's all I need.

124
00:10:08,277 --> 00:10:10,124
Franklin, no!

125
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:12,406
Look, this isn't my responsibility.

126
00:10:12,456 --> 00:10:14,380
This, this is company property.

127
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:18,416
Okay ...

128
00:10:18,682 --> 00:10:20,185
I tell you what, Doc.

129
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,975
Jacobs made me put down the other 12.
 

130
00:10:22,968 --> 00:10:24,712
I'm done.

131
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,676
Be my guest.

132
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:54,477
Hey!
- Oh, hi. 

133
00:10:54,568 --> 00:10:58,435
You look beat.
- Yeah. How's he doing?

134
00:10:58,965 --> 00:11:01,169
Well, he has good days and bad days.

135
00:11:01,322 --> 00:11:03,619
Today, not so good, although he

136
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:05,816
has been quoting Shakespeare.

137
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:09,075
Oh, you got a pet?

138
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:12,337
Uh, it's just a temporary house guest.

139
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:14,257
Well, maybe that'll be good for him.

140
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,257
Good night!

141
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:22,921
[discordant piano playing]

142
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,462
Hi, Dad!

143
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:35,756
Dad?

144
00:11:35,865 --> 00:11:39,870
Will! I didn't hear 
you come in.

145
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:42,942
Today's the day, right?

146
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:44,558
You thought I'd forget?

147
00:11:44,608 --> 00:11:46,750
You have a big test today, right?

148
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,747
Chemistry?

149
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,553
Hey, Dad ...

150
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:55,080
You want to see something?
- What?

151
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,306
What is that? Is he injured?

152
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:10,477
No, I think that's a birthmark.

153
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:19,601
"As for Caesar, kneel down,
kneel down and wonder!"

154
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:21,602
Yeah, don't get too attached.

155
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:25,390
He's a cute little guy, isn't he?

156
00:13:12,632 --> 00:13:14,672
Where's my car keys?

157
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:18,341
My car keys, where'd you put 'em?

158
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:23,179
Dad, ... you a, you don't drive anymore.

159
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:26,419
I know that.

160
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:30,694
Here ...

161
00:13:32,352 --> 00:13:35,529
Why don't you feed him. 
Can you do that?

162
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:36,995
Of course, I can..

163
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:48,025
Will! ... Look at this!

164
00:13:51,322 --> 00:13:55,511
How old is he? 
Like, a day old? Two days old?

165
00:13:55,561 --> 00:13:56,624
Yeah ...

166
00:13:57,762 --> 00:14:00,176
He's a smart one, isn't he?

167
00:14:00,226 --> 00:14:03,002
What are you going to name him?

168
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:06,457
I do not know ...

169
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:17,599
Three years later

170
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:20,445
Right away, Caesar displayed signs
of intelligence heightened intelligence,

171
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:23,988
so I kept him.   And, brought
my work home.

172
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:39,855
By 18 months,
Caesar was signing up to 24 words.

173
00:14:45,908 --> 00:14:49,051
By age two,
Caesar completing puzzles and models

174
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:52,277
designed for children
eight years and up.

175
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:59,217
At age three,

176
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,587
Caesar continues to show cognative skills

177
00:15:01,697 --> 00:15:05,051
that far exceed
that of his human counterpart. 

178
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:08,241
Home ... home.

179
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,098
He completed the Lucas Tower in
 15 moves, a perfect score.

180
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:17,793
I maintain my hypothesis that:
A. The green in his eyes indicate

181
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:22,063
that the ALZ-112 was passed 
genetically from mother to son

182
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:26,344
and, B. That in the absence of damaged
 cells that need to be replacing

183
00:15:26,513 --> 00:15:32,536
the drug in his system has radically
boosted healthy brain functioning.

184
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:36,601
And, ... 

185
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:40,300
he plays chess pretty well.

186
00:15:42,137 --> 00:15:44,137
[shouting]

187
00:15:45,437 --> 00:15:47,385
Dad!

188
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:51,333
I'm sorry.
- I can't do this, anymore.

189
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,962
He belongs in a home.

190
00:15:53,012 --> 00:15:55,245
This is no way for him to live.

191
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:03,620
No way to live?

192
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:07,898
I broke my lamp ...

193
00:17:02,532 --> 00:17:04,184
It'll make you better, Dad.

194
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,666
[Shhh...]

195
00:17:44,178 --> 00:17:45,400
Dad!

196
00:17:46,254 --> 00:17:47,818
Dad!

197

[exuberant piano playing]

198
00:18:10,844 --> 00:18:13,352
Todd, come inside for breakfast.

199
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:34,632
I'll need to keep track of
what I take from the lab,

200
00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:37,539
although I don't see you needing
more than one treatment a month.

201
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:39,201
Something amazing has happened!

202
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:43,293
I'll need a blood test,
a scan and the dosage ...

203
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,035
carefully monitored.

204
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:46,954
Now, if I can sneak ...

205
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:50,059
Will!  I'm not sick, anymore!

206
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,067
It was nothing, Dad.

207
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:55,507
Ceasar.  Where's Caesar?
 I want to see him.

208
00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:04,340
Caesar!

209
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:11,543
Caesar!

210
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:13,223
He can't have gone far.

211
00:19:13,497 --> 00:19:15,289
Caesar!

212
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:18,081
Daddy!

213
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:19,614
Caesar!

214
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:21,717
Get out of here! Get out!

215
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:25,678
Get out!

216
00:19:27,994 --> 00:19:31,008
Hey, hey, hey ...
Enough! Enough!

217
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:32,675
It doesn't matter what you do.

218
00:19:32,768 --> 00:19:34,910
If I catch that animal anywhere
 near my house or my kids, again ...

219
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:36,343
He's not dangerous.

220
00:19:36,393 --> 00:19:38,076
It won't happen again.

221
00:19:38,181 --> 00:19:39,665
Damn right, it won't!

222
00:19:40,228 --> 00:19:43,722
Come on, Dad.
- He, he just wanted to play.

223
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:47,856
Stay in the house!
Daddy's got you.

224
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:50,573
I told you not to go out without us.

225
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:54,034
It's okay ...

226
00:19:55,344 --> 00:19:56,747
How bad is it?

227
00:19:57,518 --> 00:19:58,931
I do not know.

228
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:20,750
He likes you.
- Uh, huh.

229
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:23,703
Don't worry. It'll be over soon.

230
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:25,327
Then, we can go get a treat.

231
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,024
I'm thinking, ice cream.

232
00:20:33,391 --> 00:20:34,612
Good idea!

233
00:20:35,655 --> 00:20:38,841
You taught him to sign?

234
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:41,100
Just, handful of things, basic stuff.

235
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:45,063
What's he saying?

236
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:45,895
Nothing.

237
00:20:47,577 --> 00:20:50,159
So, when do you think we should come back?

238
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:50,680
Well, you won't need to come back.

239
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:54,166
because, um, 
the stiches are dissolveable.

240
00:20:54,216 --> 00:20:56,544
I would just say, watch for
signs of infection.

241
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:58,610
Fever ... redness ...

242
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,557
Okay, what's he saying, now?

243
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:04,898
Um, 

244
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:06,341
well, ...

245
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:10,398
he thinks that you and I should
have dinner together.

246
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:15,898
(chuckling) I ... know ...

247
00:21:20,151 --> 00:21:22,226
Caesar! Come on!

248
00:21:22,336 --> 00:21:24,531
Good to see you, again, Caroline.

249
00:21:24,939 --> 00:21:26,669
You coming, Caesar?

250
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:28,479
So, what's your secret?

251
00:21:29,135 --> 00:21:32,224
Oh, I can't take any credit.
It's in his genes.

252
00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:34,217
I think you're being very modest.

253
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:35,207
He's pretty amazing.

254
00:21:37,449 --> 00:21:41,146
I think you've built a pretty good
home for Caesar, here.

255
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,339
You know he won't stay this way for long.

256
00:21:46,084 --> 00:21:47,937
He's going to soon grow into

257
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:49,705
a large, powerful, animal.

258
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:51,329
Come here!

259
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:54,463
How's he been doing?

260
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:55,857
Okay, I think.

261
00:21:56,842 --> 00:21:58,892
I love chimpanzees.

262
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,538
I'm also afraid of them.

263
00:22:02,366 --> 00:22:05,006
And, it's appropriate to
be afraid of them.

264
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:06,965
Caesar will never hurt anyone.

265
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,728
He's happy here.

266
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:13,584
Yeah, I see that.

267
00:22:14,922 --> 00:22:17,864
We can at least give him some open space?

268
00:22:17,914 --> 00:22:20,132
- Yeah. That would prpbably be a good idea.

269
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,610
I know a place right across the bridge, 

270
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,774
the Redwoods.  It's a paradise.

271
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,805
Come on!

272
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:48,161
Come here.

273
00:22:48,274 --> 00:22:50,410
Doesn't need a leash!
He'll be fine. Come on!

274
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,703
Just to be safe.
- Come on, Caesar!

275
00:22:57,849 --> 00:23:00,099
It's the redwoods.

276
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,148
Caesar!

277
00:23:10,378 --> 00:23:11,178
All right.

278
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:16,383
If I take this off you can
not leave my sight.

279
00:23:16,473 --> 00:23:18,551
I'll never find you again.

280
00:23:19,092 --> 00:23:20,482
Okay.

281
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:24,493
What's this?
- What's he doing?

282
00:23:24,741 --> 00:23:27,366
I don't believe that!
- What?

283
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,720
He's asking your permission.

284
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,026
It's a supplicating gesture.

285
00:23:32,573 --> 00:23:34,555
It's okay.

286
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,593
Come on, Caesar!
Off you go!

287
00:23:49,655 --> 00:23:51,390
Look at him go!

There you are ...

Come on, Caesar, climb!

295
00:24:23,341 --> 00:24:24,874
Go higher!

296
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,849
Climb!

297
00:24:35,823 --> 00:24:37,288
Be careful!

298
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,567

What's going on, buddy?

302
00:25:38,618 --> 00:25:40,475
Give some love.

303

Come on, honey.

304
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,735

It's all right. Come on.

Come on!

314
00:26:19,794 --> 00:26:21,055
Let's go.

315
00:26:22,354 --> 00:26:25,690
Are you getting in? 

316
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,395
Caesar ...

317
00:26:45,762 --> 00:26:47,281
You okay, pal?

318
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:52,541
Are you pet? ... No.

319
00:26:52,592 --> 00:26:55,852
You're not a pet.

320
00:27:02,178 --> 00:27:04,124
I am your father.

321
00:27:09,512 --> 00:27:11,196
What is Caesar?

322
00:27:14,351 --> 00:27:15,656
Okay ...

323
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:25,932
Caesar, this is where I work.

324
00:27:25,982 --> 00:27:28,750
This is were you were born.

325
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:32,758
Your mother was here
with other chimpanzees.

326
00:27:35,485 --> 00:27:39,345
But she's not here, anymore ...

327
00:27:39,395 --> 00:27:40,122
so ...

328
00:27:41,568 --> 00:27:44,938
... that's why I took home
to live with me.

329
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:53,301
Yeah.

330
00:27:54,704 --> 00:27:57,106
Your mother's dead.

331
00:27:59,182 --> 00:28:02,692
The thing is, she was given medicine,

332
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,142
like the medicine I give to Charles.

333
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:08,870
She passed it on to you.

334
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,557
That's why you're so smart.

335
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:16,409
Let's take him home.

336
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:35,446
Come on, explain it to me.

337
00:28:35,496 --> 00:28:36,173
All right.

338
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:40,166
I snuck him out of the lab
to save his life.

339
00:28:40,306 --> 00:28:44,157
I had no idea that the effects had
been transfered vertically from his mother.

340
00:28:44,312 --> 00:28:48,134
But, since then, he's been displaying
incredible signs intelligence.

341
00:28:48,244 --> 00:28:52,696
I designed the 112 to repair,
but Caesar's gone way beyond that.

342
00:28:52,846 --> 00:28:55,656
Here's his IQ from last year.

343
00:28:55,763 --> 00:28:58,470
Since then, it's doubled.

344
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:01,710
This is all wrong.

345
00:29:01,804 --> 00:29:04,900
My father was on gone
this drug brought him back.

346
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:06,856
You never saw how bad he was.

347
00:29:06,906 --> 00:29:08,308
He has his life again.

348
00:29:08,211 --> 00:29:10,571
And, what about Caesar?
- What about him?

349
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,359
How does he fit in?

350
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:16,801
With me, ... with us ...

351
00:29:17,168 --> 00:29:18,108
Listen, ... 

352
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:20,708
I know it has been hard for you,

353
00:29:21,222 --> 00:29:24,222
but you are trying to control things
that were never meant to be controlled.

354
00:29:24,332 --> 00:29:25,526
The 112 works.

355
00:29:25,576 --> 00:29:28,076
Do you realize how you sound?

356
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:30,411
All I'm saying is
this is a good thing.

357
00:29:30,604 --> 00:29:32,748
Caesar's proof of that.

358
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:34,188
So's my father.

359
00:29:38,742 --> 00:29:40,103
Caesar, eat your food.

360
00:30:06,185 --> 00:30:09,732
Dad, are you okay?

361
00:30:09,782 --> 00:30:10,551
Yeah, I'm fine.

362
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:20,800
Antibodies.

363
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,182
His system has found a way
to fight the 112 virus

364
00:30:24,292 --> 00:30:26,723
so that it can't deliver
its therapy.

365
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:30,951
My father's disease is going
to return with a vengence.

366
00:31:20,217 --> 00:31:21,434
Stop!

367
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:27,316
Stop, right now!

368
00:31:27,993 --> 00:31:30,892
Hey! Get out there! 
Get out of that car!

369
00:31:31,449 --> 00:31:34,856
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of my car!

370
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:37,087
I said, get out of my car!

371
00:31:38,117 --> 00:31:39,884
I'm a pilot! I've got to get 
to the airport!

372
00:31:39,934 --> 00:31:42,111
How am I gonna get there now, huh?

373
00:31:42,242 --> 00:31:44,599
Answer the God-damn question! 
What were you doing?

374
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:46,831
I have a car just exactly ...

375
00:31:46,881 --> 00:31:49,387
I'm done ... 
the police can handle it.

376
00:31:49,568 --> 00:31:53,176
Stay right there!
You aren't going nowhere, mister!

377
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,139
You will pay!

378
00:31:55,294 --> 00:31:58,110
This is your problem,
you make it happen!

379
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,264
... not through with you! 
Stay right there!

380
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:50,346
Caesar, stop!

381
00:32:51,313 --> 00:32:52,434
Daddy!

382
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:03,543
Caesar!

383
00:33:13,526 --> 00:33:15,775
It's okay.

384
00:33:17,255 --> 00:33:18,386
It's okay. 

385
00:33:18,436 --> 00:33:20,303
He didn't mean it.

386
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:22,818
It's okay ...

387
00:33:45,866 --> 00:33:48,933
Hey, hey, take that thing off of him!

388
00:33:49,822 --> 00:33:51,942
Take that thing off of him!

389
00:33:51,993 --> 00:33:54,272
Look, I'll take him in, okay?

390
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,284
No, he's under court orders.
We can't do that.

391
00:33:56,405 --> 00:33:57,810
It's fine! Let him.

392
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,168
Bring him in when you're ready.

393
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:01,824
Take it off.

394
00:34:02,102 --> 00:34:03,378
Thank you!

395
00:34:03,944 --> 00:34:06,848
Caesar, Caesar, Caesar,
... Caesar, Caesar.

396
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:10,476
Not right now.
It's going to be okay.

397
00:34:10,571 --> 00:34:12,965
Let's just see what it's like
inside, okay.

398
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,971
Come on, Caesar.

399
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:16,748
Let's go.

400
00:34:20,555 --> 00:34:23,767
Come on, ... trust me.

401
00:34:38,654 --> 00:34:40,294
It's okay.

402
00:34:42,992 --> 00:34:44,454
Go.

403
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:55,278
He hasn't spent any time with other chimps.

404
00:34:55,328 --> 00:34:57,092
Oh, we're used to that.

405
00:34:57,221 --> 00:35:00,167
He'll be a little skittish at first,
but we'll integrate him.

406
00:35:03,873 --> 00:35:06,884
You'd be surprised
how quick they adapt.

407
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,787
We provide a stimulating environment.

408
00:35:09,837 --> 00:35:11,717
He's going to thrive here.

409
00:35:12,341 --> 00:35:14,177
Come, let's do some paperwork.

410
00:35:14,227 --> 00:35:17,054
Make sure you lock that door
when you come in.

411
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:42,674
Caesar!

412
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:45,384
You'll be okay!

413
00:35:46,397 --> 00:35:49,521
Everything's going to be okay!

414
00:35:49,572 --> 00:35:51,226
Don't be scared.

415
00:35:51,347 --> 00:35:53,529
You're going to stay here, now.

416
00:35:56,303 --> 00:36:00,635
No ... Not going home right now.

417
00:36:00,686 --> 00:36:01,750
It's OK.

418
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:06,072
The longer you drag out the good-byes,

419
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,693
the harder it is.

420
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:10,411
Can I sign that later?

421
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:15,057
You'll probably miss him more than
he'll miss you.

422
00:36:15,313 --> 00:36:17,313
You'd best give him a couple of weeks
to get used too the place.

423
00:36:17,924 --> 00:36:19,676
Will, we have to go.

424
00:36:19,726 --> 00:36:21,389
We have to go home.

425
00:36:21,526 --> 00:36:24,803
Coming back soon, okay?

426
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:32,468
Just call ahead, before you do.

427
00:36:36,478 --> 00:36:38,288
Hey, over here!

428
00:36:39,956 --> 00:36:42,025
Hey, I can get you out!

429
00:36:45,748 --> 00:36:48,645
Come on!  Over here!

430
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,108
Hey, down here.

431
00:37:16,497 --> 00:37:18,525
Stupid monkey ...

432
00:37:40,642 --> 00:37:45,923
So you? Come on, make it!

433
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,807
Court order hasn't been filed,
so it's not in the system.

434
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,836
Once it comes through,

435
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,270
it will take about 90 days before
you receive an appeal date.

436
00:37:58,383 --> 00:37:59,923
90 days?
- Yes, sir, 90 days.

437
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:01,689
You'll be notified by mail.

438
00:38:03,184 --> 00:38:04,458
Here's what's going to happen. 

439
00:38:04,484 --> 00:38:06,484
You're going to go back to your computer,
you know, shift things around

440
00:38:07,564 --> 00:38:10,247
and you're going to get me a date for
my appeal, this week, you got it?

441
00:38:10,377 --> 00:38:12,249
I can't help you.

442
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,947
All right, then we have a problem.

443
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:15,684
Because, I'm not moving until you do.

444
00:38:16,023 --> 00:38:19,891
90 days, sir. Be thankful
you're talking about court dates.

445
00:38:20,061 --> 00:38:22,559
You're lucky they
didn't put that animal down.

446
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,827
I promised to get him back
soon, Dad.

447
00:38:30,327 --> 00:38:32,469
Dad?

448
00:38:37,952 --> 00:38:41,653
My father's immune system
continues to reject the 112 virus,

449
00:38:41,788 --> 00:38:44,627
rendering the gene therapy obsolete.

450
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:50,107
his health is deteriorating,
and the disease is progressing rapidly.

451
00:38:51,012 --> 00:38:53,348
I need a more aggressive virus strain,

452
00:38:53,444 --> 00:38:55,915
a faster delivery method,

453
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,528
because at this rate ...

454
00:39:06,984 --> 00:39:08,984
I can't lose them both.

455
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:15,470
I won't lose them both.

456
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:20,007
Hi .... Can we talk?

457
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:22,595
Make it fast.  I've got a meeting.

458
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,106
The ten years you have been
running GEN-SYS,

459
00:39:26,246 --> 00:39:30,283
how many drugs have come down the pipeline
that could save millions of lives?

460
00:39:30,397 --> 00:39:32,562
 That could change everything?

461
00:39:32,654 --> 00:39:34,177
What are you talking about?

462
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:36,179
The ALZ-112.

463
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,174
What happened to you, Will?

464
00:39:40,301 --> 00:39:43,955
You used to be the star of this lab.
Now, you hardly ever show

465
00:39:44,058 --> 00:39:46,051
and when you do, you waste your time 
and that of your team's

466
00:39:46,101 --> 00:39:47,994
fixating on a drug

467
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:51,080
that, after what happened,
is never ever going to get approved.

468
00:39:51,204 --> 00:39:53,090
The 112 is dangerous, Will,

469
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,531
and it doesn't work.

470
00:39:54,651 --> 00:39:56,995
I treated my father with it.

471
00:39:57,045 --> 00:39:58,120
It does work.

472
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:01,478
You did, what?

473
00:40:01,528 --> 00:40:02,801
You did, what!?

474
00:40:02,927 --> 00:40:05,106
Beat the disease, like we predicted.

475
00:40:05,234 --> 00:40:05,767
Brilliant.

476
00:40:05,817 --> 00:40:07,356
There's been a complication.

477
00:40:07,484 --> 00:40:08,949
Well, does it work or doesn't it?

478
00:40:08,986 --> 00:40:11,539
My father's disease eventually 
outran the cure.

479
00:40:11,652 --> 00:40:13,085
Oh, for goodness sake.

480
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:16,459
The immune system produced antibodies
to beat the viral component,

481
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:18,018
but it will work.

482
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,357
I've have already developed a virus strain

483
00:40:20,407 --> 00:40:22,372
that I think will be more aggressive.

484
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,647
You think?

485
00:40:23,697 --> 00:40:26,175
Just, let me test it.

486
00:40:26,676 --> 00:40:28,991
You're wasting my time.

487
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:30,339
There's more!

488
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:34,706
The applications go beyond the disease.

489
00:40:34,803 --> 00:40:38,841
There are indications that show the 
therapy can improve cognitive functioning,

490
00:40:38,973 --> 00:40:40,231
 memory quality ...

491
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,604
What, what are you saying?

492
00:40:42,654 --> 00:40:45,270
My father didn't just recover.

493
00:40:45,425 --> 00:40:46,470
He improved.

494
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,439
You mean, increased intelligence?

495
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:50,884
It's not conclusive, but yes.

496
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:58,320
I want you, to start testing the
revised 112 on chimps, A-S-A-P. 

497
00:40:58,972 --> 00:40:59,872
Okay.

498
00:40:59,964 --> 00:41:01,964
I'll give you whatever you need, 
but get started.

499
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,344
Dinner time!

500
00:41:20,454 --> 00:41:22,232
Great Ape, primate!

501
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:28,249
Go on, don't you know food
when you see it?

502
00:41:40,076 --> 00:41:41,779
You think that's funny, huh?

503
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,462
I show you something funny!

504
00:41:59,046 --> 00:42:01,399
You'll learn who's boss, soon enough.

505
00:42:03,449 --> 00:42:04,689
What about his clothes?

506
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:05,595
What about 'em?

507
00:42:05,725 --> 00:42:10,307
I don't know ... May cause problems 
with the other apes.

508
00:42:11,742 --> 00:42:13,738
Good!

509
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,855
I counted ten apes, correct?

510
00:43:17,905 --> 00:43:18,576
Yep.

511
00:43:19,573 --> 00:43:21,836
Good.  All the way to the back.

512
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:27,306
You guys are moving really quick on this.
What's the big rush?

513
00:43:27,425 --> 00:43:29,750
First day back, 
you're still complaining.

514
00:43:45,337 --> 00:43:48,500
Koba. Hi, I'm Will.

515
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,082
This one.

516
00:43:59,984 --> 00:44:01,388
He's very calm.

517
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:01,889
Yeah.

518
00:44:02,028 --> 00:44:05,586
He's been through a whole lot of labs.
He knows the drill.

519
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,856
Could I join you,
what's our progress.

520
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:13,364
Get him prepped.

521
00:44:18,293 --> 00:44:20,191
Tighten your masks.

522
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,835
Pass me the 113.

523
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:26,188
Pulse-ox is good, 
blood pressure is steady.

524
00:44:30,513 --> 00:44:32,648
Perisol delivery, in place.

525
00:44:37,918 --> 00:44:40,107
Releasing the 113.

526
00:44:56,679 --> 00:44:58,503
We have a break!

527
00:44:58,597 --> 00:45:00,598
Franklin, get your mask on!

528
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:04,455
Got it?

529
00:45:04,505 --> 00:45:05,495
Yeah.

530
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,572
You okay?

531
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:09,195
Yeah, okay.

532
00:45:15,933 --> 00:45:17,348
Move it!  Let's go!

533
00:45:18,397 --> 00:45:21,014
Get up and do some exercises
you lazy baboons!

534
00:48:04,383 --> 00:48:06,626
Intelligence results are remarkable.

535
00:48:06,729 --> 00:48:07,877
There are no adverse effects.

536
00:48:07,999 --> 00:48:10,045
Apes have amazingly strong
immune systems.

537
00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:13,274
All right, keep an eye on him.

538
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:14,867
Okay. [Franklin sneezes]

539
00:48:14,929 --> 00:48:16,130
Sorry about that.

540
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:19,112
These guys are more resiliant than I am. 

541
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:23,959
Excuse me a second.

542
00:49:18,486 --> 00:49:19,796
He's good.

543
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:35,956
You're working late tonight.

544
00:49:36,064 --> 00:49:38,139
GEN-SYS needs three more.

545
00:50:03,807 --> 00:50:05,533
Hey, Caesar!

546
00:50:07,021 --> 00:50:10,526
Are you hurt?

547
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:13,275
Show me.

548
00:50:16,299 --> 00:50:20,402
Caesar, give me your hand. 
Give me your hand.

549
00:50:20,497 --> 00:50:22,590
Sometimes, the new kid on the
block gets picked on.

550
00:50:22,695 --> 00:50:26,004
Stay calm. What did they do?

551
00:50:26,331 --> 00:50:27,583
That's bullshit!

552
00:50:29,632 --> 00:50:31,530
What's the problem here?

553
00:50:33,419 --> 00:50:35,539
I'm taking him out of here, right now.

554
00:50:35,589 --> 00:50:37,709
Not without a court order, you're not.

555
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,030
He's not yours, anymore.

556
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,295
I promise, if I find out he's been 
mistreated in any way,

557
00:50:42,405 --> 00:50:45,350
I'll have this place shut down.

558
00:50:47,117 --> 00:50:48,375
Go on ...

559
00:50:57,096 --> 00:51:01,099
No.  No, we're not going home, 
right now. 

560
00:51:01,149 --> 00:51:05,788
I'm going to get you out of here,
 I promise.

561
00:51:08,205 --> 00:51:09,872
You have to trust me.

562
00:51:09,998 --> 00:51:12,459
Caesar, you have to trust me, okay?

563
00:51:12,509 --> 00:51:14,402
I think this visit's over.

564
00:51:14,676 --> 00:51:15,834
Trust me.

565
00:51:15,884 --> 00:51:17,831
You'll be okay.

566
00:52:01,246 --> 00:52:03,275
Come on, move it!
Let's go!

567
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:54,438
There are hundreds of them!
Looks like you're own private zoo!

568
00:52:54,553 --> 00:52:56,824
Rather like a prison
for hairy dudes.

569
00:52:57,017 --> 00:52:58,555
They watch TV?

570
00:52:58,605 --> 00:53:01,036
We call it enrichment.

571
00:53:03,088 --> 00:53:06,208
Aw, this one's so cute!

572
00:53:06,258 --> 00:53:08,557
 What's his name?

573
00:53:08,607 --> 00:53:11,321
Uh, name's Cornelia. It's a she.

574
00:53:11,371 --> 00:53:12,031
[shreek]

575
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:13,940
Oh, my God!

576
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:14,780
Don't get too close!

577
00:53:14,897 --> 00:53:16,812
This one scared me half to death.

578
00:53:16,862 --> 00:53:18,718
That big guy is called, Maurice.

579
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:20,935
It's no fun.

580
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:23,851
Here, I'll show you something fun.

581
00:53:27,584 --> 00:53:29,110
Check this out!

582
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,257
It's crazy!

583
00:53:34,414 --> 00:53:36,683
You shouldn't be in here.

584
00:53:36,733 --> 00:53:38,268
Hey, you're next!

585
00:53:44,942 --> 00:53:46,208
Come on, let's go.

586
00:53:46,258 --> 00:53:49,172
We spent too much time in here,
 as it is.

587
00:53:51,307 --> 00:53:52,479
Come on!

588
00:53:52,571 --> 00:53:54,226
Check out this guy.

589
00:53:54,276 --> 00:53:58,141
Hey, Alan, he's a pain in the ass. 
He thinks he's special, or something

590
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:01,388
Freaky!

591
00:54:02,561 --> 00:54:04,074
Hey, come here.

592
00:54:04,568 --> 00:54:06,617
I think he's thinking or something.

593
00:54:07,929 --> 00:54:10,284
Oh, my God, he's got him by the throat!

594
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:10,980
Let him go!

595
00:54:11,075 --> 00:54:12,510
Let go!

596
00:54:14,336 --> 00:54:16,100
Are you okay?

597
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:16,675
Yes.

598
00:54:17,225 --> 00:54:19,405
I told you not
 to get too close, man.

599
00:54:19,499 --> 00:54:21,700
Come on, guys, let's get out of here.

600
00:59:10,193 --> 00:59:13,064
Some things aren't meant
be changed.

601
00:59:13,659 --> 00:59:15,592
You need to accept that.

602
00:59:19,555 --> 00:59:20,730
Hey!

603
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,955
Hey!

604
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:24,010
What's going on here?

605
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,662
More 113 trials.
We're just prepping ...

606
00:59:25,776 --> 00:59:28,347
Oh, no, we have to analyze
Koba's blood work first!

607
00:59:28,455 --> 00:59:30,386
Franklin knows this.
Where is he?

608
00:59:30,437 --> 00:59:32,012
He's out sick for two days.

609
00:59:32,105 --> 00:59:34,586
Well, I didn't authorized this.

610
00:59:34,636 --> 00:59:35,554
No!

611
00:59:35,646 --> 00:59:37,103
I did.

612
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:39,531
We agreed to test sparingly
on one subject.

613
00:59:39,646 --> 00:59:42,214
And, that one subject is stunning!

614
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:44,998
It's a virus. We don't know the human
related effects.

615
00:59:45,133 --> 00:59:46,782
The drug works, Will.

616
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,083
Tell him, Linda.

617
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,097
For starters, Koba scored
a perfect 15 on the Lucas Tower.

618
00:59:52,219 --> 00:59:54,219
Every test result verifies
its effectiveness.

619
00:59:54,431 --> 00:59:55,942
No more tests.
- What are you ...?

620
00:59:56,042 --> 00:59:57,954
Not until we have a better understanding
of what we're dealing with.

621
00:59:58,065 --> 01:00:00,042
Look, I'll tell you exactly
what we do. Look ...

622
01:00:00,092 --> 01:00:00,859
Give us a minute.

623
01:00:00,985 --> 01:00:03,586
Excuse me!   Put the ape
back in the cage. Be gentle.

624
01:00:03,698 --> 01:00:06,773
Will, I'll tell you exactly what 
we're dealing with, here.

625
01:00:06,925 --> 01:00:09,086
We're dealing with a drug
that is worth more

626
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:12,247
than everything else
we are developing, combined.

627
01:00:12,417 --> 01:00:14,315
You make history, 

628
01:00:14,365 --> 01:00:15,729
I make money.

629
01:00:15,838 --> 01:00:18,251
Isn't that our arrangement?
- No! There are risks.

630
01:00:18,346 --> 01:00:20,126
Don't you tell me about risks.

631
01:00:20,237 --> 01:00:23,293
You give your own father
an experimental drug.

632
01:00:23,461 --> 01:00:25,935
I could finish your career
with one phone call.

633
01:00:26,054 --> 01:00:28,436
I'll save you the trouble. I quit.

634
01:00:29,779 --> 01:00:32,669
We will proceed without you.

635
01:00:33,832 --> 01:00:36,226
Look ... You do not know what you're doing.

636
01:00:36,276 --> 01:00:38,164
 These tests need to be contained.

637
01:00:38,272 --> 01:00:40,516
You have no idea if the 113 is stable,

638
01:00:40,566 --> 01:00:43,109
what kind of damage it can
do to people ...

639
01:00:43,203 --> 01:00:48,171
Well, that is why we test it 
on chimps, ... isn't it?

640
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:52,390
Dr. Rodman, it's, me, Franklin!
I need to talk to you!

641
01:00:52,489 --> 01:00:54,516
Can you come to the door?

642
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:08,958
Doc!
[coughing]

643
01:01:09,289 --> 01:01:11,487
Who the hell are you?
[Franklin sneezes on neighbor]

644
01:01:14,699 --> 01:01:16,339
Get out of here!

645
01:01:16,447 --> 01:01:18,649
I'm sorry, ... I'm sorry.   

646
01:01:34,328 --> 01:01:37,406
You wouldn't be trying to entrap me,
would you?

647
01:01:40,335 --> 01:01:43,753
Well, ... I can't say that I approve.

648
01:01:43,803 --> 01:01:46,477
They're not people, you know.

649
01:01:46,586 --> 01:01:48,411
You gonna to let him go or not?

650
01:02:01,629 --> 01:02:04,669
Caesar, ... hey, come on.

651
01:02:05,462 --> 01:02:07,802
Come on, we're go home.

652
01:02:09,582 --> 01:02:11,394
Home.

653
01:02:12,013 --> 01:02:13,967
Come on, we're really going.

654
01:02:15,933 --> 01:02:17,709
Let's get out of here.

655
01:02:25,902 --> 01:02:29,539

I guess he likes it better here

I ain't dodging. 
I'm telling the truth.

666
01:09:32,422 --> 01:09:33,780
Yeah, well, if I've didn't 
take the cookies,

667
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:34,545
Then, who the hell did?

668
01:09:34,655 --> 01:09:35,859
I, I do not know ...

He spoke.

[Video] I'll beat each and
everyone of you.

I need someone to coordinate
with the S.F.P.D.

Tell them we got a fatality.

What is it?

Look, something terrible 
has happened.

Franklin is dead
from a viral infection.

What the hell are you
talking about?

 He was exposed to the 113.  
It does something 

720
01:19:10,631 --> 01:19:12,676
to people that it doesn't
do to apes.

721

We'll have to go through the city
and across the bridge.

to destroy them.

Just, trust me on this!
Okay?

728

Find the lead!

They're being led.  These apes
are smarter than you think.

They've got a leader!

735
01:22:46,335 --> 01:22:50,375
Do not tell them I am stuck in traffic.
Make up with something smarter!

736
01:22:50,671 --> 01:22:51,827
Hold on.
