1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,140
I, Olof Henrik Edvard Vergerus...

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,140
take thee,
Elisabet Emilie Josefin Ekdahl...

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,140
to be my wedded wife...

4
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,260
to love you for better and for worse...

5
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,620
and as a symbol of this love
I give you this ring.

6
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,660
I, Elisabet Emilie Josefin Ekdahl...

7
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,660
take thee,
Olof Henrik Edvard Vergerus,

8
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,100
to be my wedded husband...

9
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,180
to love you for better and for worse...

10
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,900
and as a symbol of this love
I take this ring.

11
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:27,860
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

12
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,420
Amen.

13
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,900
As well as they have consented
in sacred marriage...

14
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,260
I wonder if this is a good thing.

15
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,420
You saw how happy she was.

16
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,900
- I'm thinking of the children.
- They'll get used to it, dear mama.

17
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,340
He's a devil of a lady killer,
the Bishop is.

18
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,340
You don't know that for sure, Carl.

19
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,060
I don't know
why I just want to cry.

20
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,220
They should have taken a honeymoon.

21
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,020
I invited them to our house in Provence,
but Emilie refused.

22
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,060
That's not so strange.

23
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,580
She has great respect
for her new husband.

24
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,820
He's a handsome man,
whatever you say.

25
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,540
- I expect he has false teeth.
- Petra, don't be silly.

26
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,340
His mother was nice.

27
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,980
They say his sister's a bitch.

28
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,100
I've a feeling we'll have Emilie back...

29
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,660
quite soon.

30
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,660
the children don't appear
to have an appetite.

31
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,700
Everything's new and strange to them.
You must understand, Henrietta.

32
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,300
Perhaps they're turning up
their noses at the food.

33
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,660
Let's be happy
on our first evening together.

34
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,060
I have no desire to spoil it,

35
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,420
but in the future -

36
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,820
yes, I might as well mention it now.

37
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,340
In the future no one may leave the table
without having eaten up -

38
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,580
Dearest Henrietta,
Ill tell my children what to do.

39
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,980
There's a basic rule in this house
which no one must break,

40
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,380
not even you, dear Emilie,

41
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,260
and that is respect
for the temporal gifts.

42
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,620
I think you've misunderstood
an essential point, dearest Henrietta.

43
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,860
But I suggest we postpone this discussion
to a more suitable time.

44
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,500
Forgive me, dear Emilie.
I am forgetting myself.

45
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,140
I'm sure you're a more capable
housewife than I.

46
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,380
I'll ask your advice in all things.

47
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,420
Edvard has admonished me
a hundred times.

48
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,660
It's not easy to realize

49
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,620
one has become superfluous!

50
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,740
That will do, Henrietta.

51
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,860
Perhaps I may be allowed to share

52
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,180
that we are early risers in this house,
both weekdays and Sundays.

53
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,740
At 6:00 we gather
for morning prayers in Edvard's study.

54
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,380
I'd also like to mention that we make
our own beds and tidy our rooms.

55
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,020
In this house, punctuality,
cleanliness and order are the rule.

56
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,580
Don't be alarmed, children.

57
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,100
My sister makes it sound
worse than it actually is.

58
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,300
We'll start out very gently.

59
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,500
I'm not sure I understand.

60
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,100
If you mean to apply
a new method of upbringing -

61
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,140
Not at all, dear Emilie.

62
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,700
I'm convinced that the children
will soon realize

63
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,900
how fun it is to perform
one's duties conscientiously.

64
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,220
It's all to be like a game.

65
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,460
My children don't care
for that sort of game,

66
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,460
and neither do I.

67
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,660
Time will tell, dear Emilie.

68
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,700
They're coming now.
Into bed, both of you!

69
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,500
Now we'll say our prayers.

70
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,820
Thank you, God, for this day.
Please make me good.

71
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,780
May your angel stay by me
through the night.

72
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,780
God bless papa and mama
and grandpapa and grand -

73
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,260
and uncle Edvard.

74
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,500
and uncle Edvard.

75
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,620
myself and my brothers and sisters
and cousins, uncles and aunts,

76
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,580
Vega, Ester, Maj,
Siri, Berta, Alida, Lisen.

77
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,540
and uncle Isak
and everybody else. Amen.

78
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,180
Good night, Alexander.

79
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,380
Justina, Id like to speak to you
about tomorrow.

80
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,660
What's that book you're reading,
Alexander?

81
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,060
What's that book you're reading,
Alexander?

82
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,740
Good night, my boy.

83
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,700
Good night, my child.
God bless you.

84
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,180
Good night, uncle Edvard.

85
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,300
My dearest wish is for us to live
at peace with one another.

86
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,300
Love cannot be commanded,

87
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,180
but we can show respect
and consideration.

88
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,980
You go ahead, my dear.
I'll come later.

89
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,380
Whose doll house is this?

90
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,140
Fifteen years ago,
two little girls lived in this room.

91
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,300
They drowned in the river
with their mother.

92
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,100
- Perhaps the house is haunted.
- There are no such things as ghosts.

93
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,100
- Did they live in this room?
- I think this was the nursery.

94
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,940
Good night. Sleep well.

95
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,900
I think we've got
a terrible stepfather.

96
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,940
And the sister is crazy.

97
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,060
And that tub of lard
that has to be fed.

98
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,500
I don't want to live here.

99
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,020
You have to give me time.

100
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,580
Much has to be changed.

101
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,580
Some things will go quickly,
others will take time.

102
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,620
The main thing is not to lose heart.

103
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,180
Why did you marry the Bishop?

104
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,020
Because I love him.

105
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,460
Now let us sleep. Things will seem
better when we're not so tired.

106
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,460
Don't play Hamlet, my son.

107
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,580
I'm not queen Gertrude,

108
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,300
your kind stepfather
isn't the king of Denmark,

109
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,260
and this is not Elsinore castle,

110
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,980
even if it does look rather gloomy.

111
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,620
Hell and damnation.

112
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,900
Come, Fanny.
I'll show you something.

113
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,580
The windows are barred.

114
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,580
They can't be opened.

115
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,860
Yes, Oscar, that's how it is.

116
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,700
One is old and a child
at the same time.

117
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,020
What became
of those long years in between

118
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,940
that seemed so important
at the time?

119
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,380
May I take your hand?

120
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,380
I remember your hand as a child.

121
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,500
It was small and firm and dry.

122
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,500
And your wrist
was so awfully slender.

123
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,980
I enjoyed being a mother.

124
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,500
I enjoyed being an actress, too,
but I preferred being a mother.

125
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,820
I liked having a big belly,

126
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,060
and I didn't give two shakes
about the theatre then.

127
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,420
It's all acting anyway.

128
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,820
Some roles are nice,
others not so nice.

129
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,500
I played a mother.

130
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,820
I played Juliet and Margareta.

131
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,860
Then suddenly I played a widow
or a grandmother.

132
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,620
One role follows the other.

133
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,460
The thing is
not to shrink from them.

134
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,660
But what became of it all?

135
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,260
Can you tell me that, my boy?

136
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,940
You're a good boy

137
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,460
to listen to your old mother's soliloquies,
as Isak calls them.

138
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,460
Yes, you're a good boy, Oscar...

139
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,180
and I grieved terribly
when you passed away.

140
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,260
That was a strange role to play.

141
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,980
My feelings came
from deep in my body.

142
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,500
Even though I could control them...

143
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,100
they shattered reality,
if you know what I mean.

144
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,700
Reality has remained broken
ever since...

145
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,700
and, oddly enough,
it feels more real that way.

146
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,940
So I don't bother to mend it.

147
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,220
I just don't care anymore
if nothing makes sense.

148
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,020
Oscar, my dear boy?

149
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,620
- Yes, mama.
- Are you sad?

150
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,700
I'm worried.

151
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,460
About the children?

152
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,300
Supper time.

153
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,660
Then you are to go straight to bed.

154
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,500
The tray can be left until tomorrow.

155
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,780
Mrs. Tander sent some cookies for you.

156
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,300
I'll be upset if miss Vergerus
finds out I gave these to you.

157
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,060
Hasn't mother returned?

158
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,980
No, your mother has not returned.

159
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,180
She said she'd be back this evening.

160
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,500
Oh, dear, I don't know what to say.

161
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,020
Why do you keep sighing like that?

162
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,180
I haven't been in this house long,
thank goodness...

163
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,940
but Mrs. Tander,
who's been here since the first wife,

164
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,860
could tell you a thing or two.

165
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,620
Would you like a cookie?

166
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,820
- Yes, thank you.
- What does Mrs. Tander say?

167
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,980
That it was the same
in the first wife's day.

168
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,100
Only worse.

169
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,580
- Poor children.
- You mean us?

170
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,260
No, I don't mean you.

171
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,020
I mean the poor little ones who found
their grave in the dark river outside.

172
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,420
Their mother tried to save them,

173
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,900
but she was pulled down
by the current.

174
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,660
They found them later by the bridge.

175
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,100
They clung tightly to each other

176
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,900
as if they were one big body.

177
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,980
The arms had to be sawn off
to get the bodies into separate coffins.

178
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,060
Mrs. Tander says that since then,
it has never been quiet in this house.

179
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,100
There are no ghosts.

180
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,100
I don't mean to frighten you...

181
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,380
but this house
does funny things to you.

182
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,180
Look at my hand.

183
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,620
Skin's been completely ripped off,
stripped down to the flesh.

184
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,220
I was taking his grace his coffee.

185
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,060
When I grabbed the doorknob,
the skin stuck and ripped off.

186
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,260
Someone laughed behind me.

187
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,580
I heard it clearly and turned around..

188
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,260
But there was no one there.

189
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,420
I feel sorry for anyone who -

190
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,100
I shouldn't chatter on like this.

191
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,060
I'll keep quiet.

192
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,020
I'll close the door now.

193
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,940
Don't worry.

194
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,540
Your mother will probably
be back tomorrow,

195
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:28,260
and his grace will personally
release you from captivity.

196
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,860
- I've seen them.
- Who?

197
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,940
The woman and the children.

198
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,500
Is that the truth?

199
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,380
Are you telling the truth, Alexander?

200
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,620
Word of honour as a Swedish citizen.

201
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,460
Where did you see them?

202
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,340
I had been in the library
with that man who married my mother.

203
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,260
He'd been lecturing me.

204
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,420
I don't remember why.

205
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,780
I was passing through
the dining room...

206
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,380
and it was unusually bright.

207
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,460
Then I saw a little girl
in the doorway.

208
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,780
She ran past me without a sound.

209
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,620
Then I saw the older girl,

210
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,660
with the dark hair and big eyes.

211
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,460
She stopped and looked at me

212
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,380
and motioned to me to turn around.

213
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,900
And there in the bright sunlight...

214
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,900
stood the woman in her black dress.

215
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:44,260
She said in a faint,
almost inaudible voice...

216
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,300
not to be afraid,

217
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,620
that she had something to tell me.

218
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,860
What did she say?

219
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,860
I don't want to frighten anyone,

220
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,100
but these were her very words:

221
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,780
"I want you to know our secret.

222
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,420
Your stepfather, my husband,

223
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,820
locked me and my children
in the bedchamber.

224
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,980
For five days and nights

225
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,860
he kept us without food and water.

226
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,340
In our misery

227
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,620
we decided to escape.

228
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:34,220
We tied sheets together
and tried to climb down

229
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,900
to the finger of land sticking out
into the deep, swirling water.

230
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,860
My daughters went first,

231
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,580
but they fell headfirst into the water

232
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,220
and were dragged under.

233
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,460
I tried to save them..

234
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,500
but was sucked down into a black whirlpool
that grabbed my clothes.

235
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,060
Underwater I grasped
my children's hands

236
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,340
and drew them to me."

237
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,180
Maj! How nice.

238
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,860
Come in, dear child.

239
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,900
I hope Im not disturbing you.

240
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,020
Not at all.
Give me a kiss.

241
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,580
That's nice.

242
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,700
Very pretty.
Did you make it yourself?

243
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,860
Yes.

244
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,380
A pretty pattern.

245
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,020
So you didn't go on the excursion?

246
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,340
No, I wouldn't fit in the boat
with my big belly.

247
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,100
Nonsense.

248
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,660
- Is something wrong?
- I'm silly to worry.

249
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,740
Let's sit here.

250
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,540
Are you worried about the children?

251
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,620
Alexander and I agreed to write.

252
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,900
I've written seven letters.

253
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,500
And you've received no reply?

254
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,820
One postcard three weeks ago.

255
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,700
"Dear Maj. We are well.

256
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,100
Uncle Edvard took us to..."

257
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,860
the botanical gardens.

258
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,260
"We learned about rare flowers."

259
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,060
"Thank you for your letters.
I'll write when I get some time.

260
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,900
Love from Alexander.

261
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,020
Fanny sends her love."

262
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,460
We mustn't underestimate Emilie.

263
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,260
She's perfectly capable
of looking after her children.

264
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,380
We're worrying for no reason.

265
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,980
I came to the family
before Fanny was born.

266
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,700
They're my children too.

267
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,980
You're going already?

268
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,500
I wanted to speak with you,
since I knew you were alone.

269
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,020
Stay a moment.

270
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,420
Thank you for your kindness,

271
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,220
but I promised to have dinner ready
when they came home.

272
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,660
I haven't put the steak
in the oven yet.

273
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,220
Dear child, are things that bad?

274
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,940
Yes.

275
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,700
- Is it the cafe?
- That too.

276
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,860
Has Gustav Adolf been pestering you?

277
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,860
I don't want to hurt him.
He's so kind.

278
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,380
What worries me most
is the children.

279
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,540
I'm sorry to be crying.
I'm behaving badly.

280
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,220
Forgive me.

281
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:04,780
Mrs. Tander wants to know
if your grace will have supper alone.

282
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,900
Tell her I don't want any supper.

283
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,700
A glass of milk and a sandwich
in my room will be sufficient.

284
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,060
Thank you, sir. I'll tell her.

285
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,820
Was there something else?

286
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,540
I don't know.

287
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,500
I don't know how to say it.
It's so unpleasant. It might seem -

288
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,820
Well?

289
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,580
Sir, I can't stand here
in the doorway.

290
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,700
Come in, then, and close the door.

291
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,980
You said I was to keep an eye
on the children,

292
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,780
listen to their conversation
and tell you of anything unusual.

293
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,980
Well?

294
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,140
Alexander made up a terrible story.

295
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,500
Really?

296
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,420
It was about -

297
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,420
Oh, it's so awful
I don't know how to get it out.

298
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,620
He says you locked
your first wife up,

299
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,700
and she was drowned with her children
when they tried to escape.

300
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,420
- That's all, sir.
- You can go.

301
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,940
Who's there?

302
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,140
It's just me.

303
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,460
Get up. Your stepfather
wants to talk to you.

304
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,020
Get dressed.
Your stepfather wants to talk to you.

305
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,340
Hurry up!

306
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,180
Alexander, my boy.

307
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,460
In the presence of your sister
and Justina you have accused me

308
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,500
of having murdered
my wife and children.

309
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,740
What?

310
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,940
Justina, please repeat
what you told me.

311
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,900
Alexander said he had seen
your first wife and children.

312
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,260
She spoke to him
and said that the bishop

313
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:47,260
had locked them all up
without food and water.

314
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,460
On the fifth day they tried to escape

315
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,300
but drowned in the attempt.

316
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,580
- Do you recognize the story?
- No.

317
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,900
- So Justina has given false testimony?
- She could have dreamt it.

318
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,340
Justina, are you prepared to confirm
your statement under oath?

319
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,660
Yes, your grace.

320
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,580
Good, Justina.

321
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,260
Fanny, did you hear
Alexander's story?

322
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,300
No.

323
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,300
So you maintain that Justina

324
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,220
was either lying or dreaming?

325
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,420
yes.

326
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,620
Please come here, Alexander.

327
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,140
Are you prepared to swear to it?

328
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,700
Of course.

329
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,940
It's a mortal sin to swear falsely.

330
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,740
It's called perjury
and is severely punished.

331
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,060
Really?

332
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,340
Lay your hand on the bible
and say after me:

333
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,700
"I, Alexander Ekdahl...

334
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,460
swear by holy writ
and by the living God...

335
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,620
that all I have said,
say and will say...

336
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,940
is the whole truth
and nothing but the truth."

337
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,380
Alexander, my boy.

338
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,180
You remember that the two of us

339
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,220
had an important conversation
about a year ago.

340
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,180
It concerned certain moral questions.

341
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,820
It wasn't really a conversation.

342
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,380
What do you mean?

343
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,900
The bishop spoke
and Alexander said nothing.

344
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,420
And felt ashamed, perhaps,
on account of your lies.

345
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,340
I've grown wiser since then.

346
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,780
You mean you lie better.

347
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,220
More or less.

348
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,900
I don't know what you imagine.

349
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:18,460
Do you think you can besmirch
another person's honour with impunity?

350
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,420
I think the bishop hates Alexander.
That's what I think.

351
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,020
Oh, so that's what you think.

352
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,620
I'll tell you something

353
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,820
that may come as a surprise.

354
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,580
I don't hate you.

355
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,900
I love you.

356
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:48,780
But the love I feel for you

357
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,740
and your mother and sister

358
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,980
is not blind and sloppy.

359
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,620
It is strong and harsh.

360
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,220
- Do you hear what I say?
- No.

361
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,180
You're hardening your heart.

362
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,420
Moreover, you misjudge the situation.

363
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,620
- I am much stronger than you are.
- I don't doubt it.

364
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,660
I mean stronger spiritually.

365
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,780
Because I have truth and justice

366
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,820
on my side.

367
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,580
I know you'll confess
in a little while.

368
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:47,660
Your confession and punishment
will be a relief to you.

369
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,060
You're a wise little man, Alexander.

370
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,380
You realize that the game is up...

371
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:00,020
but you are proud and stubborn...

372
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,940
and of course you are ashamed.

373
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,820
I've forgotten what Im to confess.

374
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:07,780
Have you now.

375
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,420
What does the bishop want
Alexander to confess?

376
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,060
You know I have means at my disposal.

377
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,860
I didn't, but I do now.

378
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,740
In my childhood,
parents were not so soft-hearted.

379
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,700
They had the cane.
I have one too.

380
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,500
It's an ordinary carpet beater,
but it can dance a fine step!

381
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:32,260
If that didn't work, we had other
effective means, namely castor oil.

382
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,900
There you see the bottle and a glass.

383
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:39,340
A few mouthfuls of this
and you're more docile.

384
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:45,060
If that didn't help,
there was a dark and cold cubby-hole

385
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,140
where you sat for a few hours until
the rats started sniffing at your face.

386
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,020
Why must I be punished?

387
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,140
That is obvious, my boy.

388
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,420
You have a weakness in your character.

389
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,260
You can't distinguish lies from truth.

390
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:07,460
So far they are just child's lies,
however dreadful they may be.

391
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,700
But soon you will be
a grown man, Alexander,

392
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,620
and life punishes liars
ruthlessly and indiscriminately.

393
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:24,780
The punishment is to teach you

394
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,020
a love of truth.

395
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,460
I confess I made it up about locking
your wife and children in.

396
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:38,420
- Do you also confess to perjury?
- I suppose so.

397
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:43,220
Now you've won a great victory,

398
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,780
a victory over yourself.

399
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,940
Which punishment do you choose?

400
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,700
Cane, castor oil
or the dark cubby-hole?

401
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,020
- How many strokes of the cane?
- Ten.

402
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,300
Then I choose the cane.

403
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:09,140
Take two cushions
and put them on the table.

404
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,820
Pull your pants down.

405
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,380
Bend over.

406
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,620
Stand up.

407
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,820
- You have something to say to me.
- No.

408
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,340
You must ask my forgiveness.

409
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,540
I won't.

410
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,380
Then I must cane you
until you think better of it.

411
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,100
Can't you spare us both
that unpleasant experience?

412
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,060
I'll never apologize.

413
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,660
You won't apologize?

414
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,780
No.

415
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,620
Bend over.

416
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,540
No more, please!

417
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,460
Will you ask forgiveness now?

418
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,900
Yes.

419
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:41,740
Button your pants and blow your nose.
Lend him a handkerchief, Justina.

420
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,020
What do you have to say now?

421
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,140
Alexander asks the bishop
for forgiveness.

422
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,420
Speak up.
I want everyone to hear your regret.

423
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,820
Alexander asks the bishop
for forgiveness.

424
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,900
For the lies and the perjury.

425
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:08,500
You do understand
that I punished you out of love?

426
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,140
Yes!

427
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,900
Kiss my hand, Alexander.

428
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,860
- May I go to bed now?
- Yes, you may.

429
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:23,580
But so that you may contemplate
the day's events in peace and quiet...

430
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,460
you're to sleep in the attic.

431
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,660
Justina will provide
a mattress and a blanket.

432
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:35,060
At 6:00 in the morning
you will be let out. Understood?

433
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,820
Yes, your grace!

434
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,580
I must go.
A carriage is waiting at the gate.

435
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,660
I'm afraid something might have
happened while Ive been here.

436
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,340
I'm in constant fear that Alexander
will say something to displease him.

437
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,980
Alexander is so foolhardy.
I've tried to warn him,

438
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,100
but he can't see that his stepfather
is a dangerous opponent

439
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,820
who's just waiting
for the right opportunity to crush him.

440
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,740
You must leave him, Emilie.

441
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,220
I'm pregnant.

442
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,500
Nevertheless, you must -

443
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,060
forgive me for interrupting.

444
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,220
I've asked him for a divorce.

445
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,820
He refuses.

446
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,140
I tell him that Ill leave
just the same.

447
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,820
Then he explains in detail
what will happen.

448
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,260
In a court of law, Ill lose on grounds
of "desertion," as it's called.

449
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:43,100
The children will be taken from me,
to be brought up by him.

450
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,780
I've written in secret
to a friend of mine who's a lawyer.

451
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,340
He's confirmed what Edvard says.

452
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,380
I am shut in

453
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,460
and can no longer breathe.

454
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,020
I'm dying, Helena!

455
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,620
I hate that man so violently

456
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,340
that I could -

457
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,860
Don't mention that Ive been here.

458
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,460
To anybody.

459
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,420
- Give me the key!
- Edvard has forbidden it.

460
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,060
Give me the key now!

461
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,140
Edvard has forbidden it!

462
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,620
You're hurting me!

463
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,900
Emilie, you can't!

464
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,060
Take your damn paint box!

465
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,340
Listen to me.

466
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,900
I told you, there's none left.

467
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,830
- Alma, we're to go up to see grandmama.
- What are you shouting about?

468
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,510
I'm just shouting!

469
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:49,590
Punch will do just as well!

470
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,650
The old girl's not here.

471
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,210
She's probably in the dining room.

472
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,370
Good evening, mama.
We came to see how you are.

473
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,050
I am very well.

474
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,770
I hope you aren't lonely.

475
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,770
Lonely? I love being alone.

476
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,770
Vega was bitten by a wasp.

477
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,970
A wasp stings, my dear.

478
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,010
It has a stinger
just like your old man.

479
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,850
Don't pinch me.

480
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,810
And Petra fell in the lake
and got soaked.

481
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,530
Where shall I serve supper?

482
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,290
I don't want any.

483
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:27,810
- How's the wasp sting?
- Not worth talking about

484
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,810
And mama is busy
with the old man's photographs.

485
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,730
How many thousands
have you sorted by now?

486
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,530
Here's one of you and your brothers.

487
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,730
You couldn't have been
more than five years old.

488
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:44,450
- You can already tell which brother -
- who is this beautiful woman?

489
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,210
Did it rain on you the whole time?

490
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,440
No, not at all, dearest mama.

491
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,760
Not a cloud over the outer islands,

492
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,720
but we saw the rain over the mainland,
and heard the thunder

493
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,160
it's rained all day here.

494
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,800
This woman with the low neckline
was one of papa's lady friends.

495
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,720
You're mistaken.
We were at school together.

496
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,440
She married a count, had 12 children
and became as big as a house.

497
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,320
I always admired your skilful way
of handling papa's little adventures.

498
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,520
We must be going.

499
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,760
Mr. Ohman and his lovely wife
are going to stop by.

500
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,680
I'm going into town tomorrow.
Anything I can do for you?

501
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,200
Thank you, Gusten.
I don't need anything.

502
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,680
But I'd like to talk
to you about Maj.

503
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,400
What the hell is it now?
She's got it good.

504
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,240
Now I'm damned angry -
if you'll excuse me, mama.

505
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,800
Calm down, Gusten!

506
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,960
He loses his temper
at the mention of Maj's name.

507
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,640
I just want to say -

508
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,880
you have to realize
Maj is not your private plaything.

509
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,520
Thanks to Alma's broad-mindedness,
she's a member of our family,

510
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,240
and she's expecting my grandchild.

511
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,640
In your dictatorial way,
you've decided her future.

512
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,210
I don't give a damn -

513
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,930
I don't like it when you swear
in your mother's presence.

514
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,970
You hear me, Gusten?

515
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,500
I like the girl. I wish her well.

516
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,020
I want to ensure her future.

517
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,140
I don't want her to be dependent
on the family's benevolence if I die.

518
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,020
She's accepted my suggestions.

519
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,940
She doesn't need any protectors,
especially against me.

520
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,830
Stop your twaddle!

521
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,120
Don't make me out as a dictator!
Maj has decided it all herself!

522
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,450
I like her.

523
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,730
I'm kind to her.
Alma's kind to her.

524
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:44,930
Now I'm hurt, let me tell you.
Damned hurt!

525
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:50,290
There's no reason
to side with Maj against me!

526
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,660
I'm fond of her.
Alma's fond of her.

527
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,580
She is loved in the same way
as Jenny, Petra and Putte.

528
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,020
Well, not exactly in the same way,
but almost.

529
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,710
She's good to me.

530
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,830
She doesn't think
I'm fat and old and disgusting.

531
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:14,390
Nobody thinks that, by the -

532
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:17,630
Ive a soft spot for the ladies.
What's to be done about it?

533
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,630
That's nothing to giggle at.

534
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,030
Maj is to go her own way through life,

535
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,110
and I'm going to give her
solid ground to stand on.

536
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:25,870
That's enough said about that.

537
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:29,710
The opera singer said he would stop by
with his wife and children. Come now.

538
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,070
Good-bye, mama. Give me a kiss.

539
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:40,190
I don't want you and alma
to sit gossiping about Maj's future.

540
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,550
I'll see to that!

541
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,870
Or rather, she will.

542
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,830
Good night, mama.
Come, Alma.

543
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:51,950
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.
- Like hell you will! Come on!

544
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:55,510
Calm down or you'll have a stroke.

545
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:59,230
I am calm.
You're the one who's shouting.

546
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,350
I want an end to all that gossip
between you and mama!

547
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,800
Good day, Mr. Jacobi.

548
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,000
Good day, miss Vergerus.

549
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,960
What is it?

550
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,840
Is His Grace -

551
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,240
he is not to be disturbed.

552
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,640
May I speak to his wife?

553
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,600
She is indisposed,
resting in her room -

554
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,160
and not to be disturbed.

555
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,200
My mother is out and I am busy.

556
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,280
His Grace might be annoyed if -

557
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,000
What is this concerning?

558
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:28,800
Some months ago,
His Grace proposed a business deal.

559
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,520
Really? I don't recall.

560
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,360
Of course not, miss Vergerus.

561
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,200
His grace is careful to spare
his family such trivial worries.

562
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:40,690
What worries of his
could concern you?

563
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,850
Please don't force me to be vulgar.

564
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:47,810
To be candid, Mr. Jacobi,
I find you unpleasant.

565
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:50,810
I've neither the time
nor the inclination to speak with you.

566
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:53,810
- Good-bye, Mr. Jacobi.
- A pecuniary predicament.

567
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:56,370
I beg your pardon?

568
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:00,410
Your brother, His Grace,
was in a pecuniary predicament.

569
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:03,370
- May I sit down?
- Not there! There.

570
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,210
In a peculiar way -
I don't know why -

571
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:08,450
I appreciate your straightforwardness.

572
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,930
And I do not appreciate
your fawning.

573
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,910
What business do you have
with my brother?

574
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:18,430
None at all, as far as I know.

575
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:20,630
I'm tired of your riddles.

576
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,430
Tell me what's on your mind and go.

577
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:25,630
I must speak to His Grace first.
It's a matter of money.

578
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,590
A lot of money.

579
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:31,350
Does my brother owe you money?

580
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:34,950
On the contrary.
It's like this:

581
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:37,750
In November
His Grace wanted to borrow money.

582
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:41,830
Regrettably, Jews have certain principles,
like never lending money to the clergy.

583
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:46,750
He suggested I should buy that chest
for a reasonable sum.

584
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:48,510
I declined.

585
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,910
So you declined.

586
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,430
Foolishly so,
since Ive now changed my mind.

587
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:59,190
I'd like to buy that chest,
and at almost any price.

588
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,070
Almost.

589
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:05,550
I will get my brother.

590
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:16,070
I told you not to disturb me.

591
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:18,310
Mr. Jacobi wants to buy the chest.

592
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:20,550
That man hangs on like vermin!

593
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,030
Stay where you are.
I'll come get you in a few minutes.

594
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,790
Take your shoes off.

595
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:52,350
Forgive an old man's
unfortunate weakness, your grace.

596
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:57,990
- You wish to buy the chest?
- Yes.

597
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,870
For how much?

598
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:01,830
Here is the sum.

599
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:11,470
It seems you've changed your mind.

600
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,510
I may have an interested buyer.

601
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:21,110
- I'm being cheated, of course.
- You're free to say no.

602
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:24,670
- Do you have the money with you?
- The money?

603
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:27,750
The money!
Of course, your grace.

604
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:29,710
I have large bills right here.

605
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,870
Let me see.

606
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:37,070
Yes, here they are.

607
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,880
- Give me the money.
- Of course.

608
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,440
If I may have your grace's name
on the contract?

609
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,760
Forgive me if I retire.

610
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,880
I shall miss you, miss Vergerus.

611
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,960
Do not take anything
that is not your due.

612
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,120
Suspicions recoil
on those who harbour them.

613
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,760
Your grace will want to ensure
that Im not taking more than my due.

614
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,200
That's quite all right.

615
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,040
I just wanted to return
the signed contract.

616
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,480
Please have a seat.

617
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,760
What would you say
about that painting?

618
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,120
A beautiful and valuable work.

619
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,160
Would it interest you?

620
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,920
My resources are regrettably
a bit strained at present.

621
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,480
- How is your wife?
- It's kind of you to inquire.

622
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,680
She is indisposed.
This sudden heat disagrees with her.

623
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,480
- May I pay my respects?
- Unfortunately not.

624
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,120
I understand.

625
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,960
Here is a letter for her
from old Mrs. Ekdahl.

626
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,120
- I shall give it to her.
- You're too kind.

627
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,040
Filthy Jewish swine!
You damned, filthy Jewish swine!

628
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,960
You thought you could cheat me.

629
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:23,800
You'll regret this,
you repulsive, hook-nosed bastard!

630
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,560
Calm down!

631
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,760
That swine is trying
to steal my children!

632
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,160
He can't.
I have the key to the nursery.

633
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,160
Don't touch them!

634
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:42,770
Come here.

635
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,810
First and foremost,
let's have something to eat.

636
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,170
This is my nephew, Aron.

637
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:54,770
Let's go to the table.

638
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:58,810
I'd like to sleep.

639
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,130
Our guests are tired.

640
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:07,890
Have you tidied the room
and made the beds?

641
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:10,050
I've done all you asked, uncle.

642
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:34,610
This is Aron's puppet theatre.

643
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:38,810
If you ask him nicely,
he may give a performance.

644
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:53,290
Behind this door lives
my nephew Ismael. He's sick.

645
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:58,370
The door must always be kept shut.
Remember that, both of you.

646
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,890
Sometimes he sings, even at night.

647
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:05,450
It's nothing to worry about.
You'll get used to it.

648
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:09,890
This will be your home
for the time being.

649
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:11,410
I hope you'll like it.

650
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:13,210
Go to bed now.

651
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,210
Good night, Fanny.

652
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:17,690
Good night, Alexander.

653
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:21,610
Lock the door at night
and don't open it for anyone.

654
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:24,690
- Don't forget to say your prayers.
- Don't go.

655
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:29,170
You want me to stay?
Then I'll sit here.

656
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:37,330
I'll go and see to Ismael.

657
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:45,650
My name is Aron.
Ismael is my brother.

658
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:47,570
Our parents died
when we were small.

659
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:54,570
I have to pee.

660
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:01,930
Damn, there's no chamber pot.

661
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:08,490
It won't be easy
to find the toilet in the dark.

662
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,300
I hope there aren't any ghosts.

663
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,940
Damn, I think I've lost my way.

664
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,540
Now Im lost for sure.

665
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,940
It's not my fault
it's all gone wrong.

666
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:11,820
I can't leave you.
I just can't.

667
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:14,540
It would be better
if you'd take off for heaven.

668
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,060
You can't help us anyway.

669
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:32,980
I lived my whole life
with you children and Emilie.

670
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,660
Death makes no difference.

671
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,460
What is it, Alexander?

672
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:48,420
Why can't you go to God
and tell him to kill the Bishop?

673
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:54,230
Or doesn't God give a damn about you,
or any of us?

674
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:58,990
Have you even seen God
on the other side?

675
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:03,910
Not a bastard
has a thought in his head.

676
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:09,030
Idiots, the whole bunch of 'em.

677
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:18,190
You must be gentle with people.

678
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:40,870
Aren't you coming to bed?

679
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:44,470
The clock has struck 4:00.

680
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:46,470
I can't sleep.

681
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:50,510
Neither can I.

682
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:55,350
Elsa's very sick.
We ought to send for the doctor.

683
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,310
He's coming in the morning.

684
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,470
- What are you drinking?
- Hot broth.

685
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:01,830
- It helps against insomnia.
- May I?

686
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:11,350
Be my guest.

687
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:15,510
Can't you forgive me?

688
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:18,590
I'm staying with you, aren't I?

689
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:24,310
I don't understand
this sudden yielding.

690
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:26,550
Drink while it's hot.

691
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:37,510
- You insist that the children return?
- Yes.

692
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:39,470
In that case, it's hopeless.

693
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:42,950
I don't care if it's hopeless.
I care only for what is right.

694
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:45,750
Isn't that Elsa calling?

695
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:52,310
Stay here. I'll see to her.

696
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:07,910
Can I help you, aunt?

697
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:09,830
It's so dark.

698
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:32,750
What time is it?

699
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,910
Almost half past 4:00.

700
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,470
It's been a long night.

701
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:40,190
Try to get some sleep.

702
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,840
My legs hurt.

703
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,560
They're swollen and aching.

704
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:00,880
You once said
you were always changing masks...

705
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,760
until finally
you didn't know who you were.

706
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,480
I have only one mask.

707
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,720
But it's branded into my flesh.

708
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,320
If I tried to tear it off -

709
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,400
I always thought people liked me.

710
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,520
I saw myself as wise,
broad-minded and fair.

711
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,280
I had no idea...

712
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,560
that anyone could hate me.

713
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,120
I don't hate you.

714
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,800
No, but your son does.

715
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,680
I'm afraid of him.

716
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,600
Who's behind the door?

717
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,000
It is God behind the door.

718
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:36,920
- Can't you come out?
- No living being may see God's face.

719
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:43,160
- What do you want?
- To prove that I exist.

720
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,840
This is the end of me.

721
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,760
Shall I show myself?

722
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,520
Now you will see me.

723
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,360
- Admit you were scared.
- I wasn't a damned bit scared.

724
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,720
"This is the end of me."

725
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:31,130
Ouch! That hurts.

726
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:33,650
Don't cry.

727
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:38,210
I didn't mean to scare you.
At least not that much.

728
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:46,210
I've been working all night
on this puppet.

729
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:51,690
A rich circus owner in England
is mad about our puppets.

730
01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:54,530
I heard you tiptoeing around.

731
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:59,930
Hear that?
My brother Ismael is awake.

732
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,170
He's singing.

733
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:10,850
Poor Ismael.

734
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:13,010
Human beings are more
than he can bear.

735
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:15,090
Sometimes he gets furious.
Then he's dangerous.

736
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:20,010
You said you'd been up all night,
but I saw you asleep.

737
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,730
There are many strange things
that can't be explained.

738
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:25,410
You realize that
when you dabble in magic.

739
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:29,330
- Have you seen our mummy?
- No.

740
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:31,370
Come.

741
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:16,930
Look carefully, Alexander.

742
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:20,010
Can you see it breathing?

743
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:24,410
It's been dead 4,000 years,
but it breathes.

744
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:27,850
I'll make the room dark.

745
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:36,210
- What do you see?
- It's shining.

746
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:38,170
Exactly.

747
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:41,610
No one knows why it's luminous.

748
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:44,610
No one can explain why.

749
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:49,530
The unknown makes people angry.

750
01:04:49,610 --> 01:04:53,610
It's better to blame it on mirrors,
machines and projections.

751
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:55,450
Then people laugh,

752
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:59,300
and that's healthier from all viewpoints,
especially financially.

753
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:02,140
Watch carefully now.

754
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,540
Uncle Isak says we're surrounded
by different realities,

755
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:28,100
one on top of the other.

756
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:31,620
There are swarms
of ghosts, spirits, phantoms,

757
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:34,860
souls, poltergeists,
angels and demons.

758
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:40,060
He says the smallest pebble
has a life of its own.

759
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:42,500
- More coffee?
- Yes, please.

760
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:45,980
Everything is alive,

761
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:48,820
and everything
is God or God's thought.

762
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:51,740
Not only good things,
but the cruellest too.

763
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:54,780
What do you think?

764
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,340
If there is a God,

765
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:00,540
then he's a shit,
and I'd like to kick him in the butt.

766
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:03,060
Your theory is very interesting

767
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:05,860
and appears to be justified.

768
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:08,940
Shall we take Ismael his breakfast?

769
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:16,620
I've brought your breakfast.

770
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:35,660
Your sister gave me sleeping pills
for my insomnia.

771
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,540
I had put three in the broth.

772
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:42,420
I didn't mean for you to drink it.

773
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:47,300
When you went to see Elsa,
I put in three more.

774
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:52,820
You will sleep soundly.

775
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:57,500
When you wake up, I will be gone.

776
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,980
I'm going back to my children...

777
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:03,860
to my home...

778
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:07,500
and my family.

779
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:32,060
I'll change and you'll come back.

780
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:34,700
I'll never come back!

781
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,700
I'll poison your life!

782
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:38,220
I'll follow you from town to town!

783
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:40,460
I'll ruin your children's future!

784
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:43,470
Poor Edvard, you don't know
what you're saying!

785
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:44,910
I am awake!

786
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:47,710
I'm horribly awake.

787
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:55,030
Help me into bed at least.

788
01:07:56,790 --> 01:07:58,910
I can't see anymore...

789
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,510
and I feel dizzy.

790
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:09,510
Are you there? I can't see.

791
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:18,230
Ismael, I've brought your breakfast.

792
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:38,990
Good morning, Ismael.

793
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:42,110
This is Alexander Ekdahl, a friend.

794
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:45,790
Leave us alone, Aron.

795
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:49,790
Don't worry. I won't eat him...

796
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:52,950
even if he does look appetizing.

797
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:57,670
You can come back in half an hour.

798
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:00,910
- Go now, Aron.
- Uncle Isak -

799
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:04,190
uncle Isak is an old goat
and needn't know of Alexander's visit.

800
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,750
Go now.

801
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:27,710
No, thank you.

802
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:31,790
My name is Ismael,
but you already know that.

803
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:37,350
"And he will be a wild man.

804
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:41,430
His hand will be against every man,

805
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:44,470
and every man's hand against him."

806
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:50,750
I'm considered dangerous.
That's why Im locked up.

807
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:52,230
Dangerous in what way?

808
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:56,390
Write your name here.

809
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:01,230
The pencil's pretty dull,
but it should still serve.

810
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:07,230
There, Alexander Ekdahl.

811
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:09,350
Now read what you've written.

812
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:14,910
It says "Ismael Retzinsky."

813
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:24,830
Perhaps we're the same person,
with no boundaries.

814
01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:27,990
Perhaps we flow through each other,

815
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:31,520
stream through each other
boundlessly and magnificently.

816
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,880
You bear such terrible thoughts...

817
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,040
it's almost painful to be near you.

818
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,160
Yet it's also enticing.

819
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,600
- Do you know why?
- I don't think I want to know.

820
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,040
You've heard of making an image
of someone you dislike

821
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,040
and sticking pins in it?

822
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,560
It's a rather clumsy method

823
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:08,200
when you think of the swift paths
an evil thought can travel.

824
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,800
You're a strange little person.

825
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:21,000
You won't speak of that
which is constantly in your thoughts.

826
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,600
You're thinking of a man's death.

827
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,640
Wait a moment.

828
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,240
I know who you're thinking of:

829
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,080
A tall man with fair, greying hair.

830
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,760
Correct me if Im wrong.

831
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:49,760
He has clear blue eyes
and a boyish face.

832
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,520
Correct me if Im wrong.

833
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:56,360
He's asleep and dreams
he's kneeling at the altar.

834
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,880
Above the altar
hangs the crucified prophet.

835
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,200
In his dream he gets up
and cries out,

836
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:08,440
"my God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me?"

837
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,200
There is no answer,

838
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,760
not even a laugh.

839
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,360
Don't talk like that.

840
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,000
It is not I talking.

841
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,120
It is yourself.

842
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,000
You are not to hesitate.

843
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:35,320
He's sound asleep,
plagued by nightmares.

844
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,640
Give me your hands.

845
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:44,160
It isn't really necessary,
but it's safer.

846
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,720
The doors will be thrown open.

847
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:52,120
A scream will echo through the house.

848
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
- I don't want to.
- It's too late.

849
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:59,440
You have only one way to go,
and I am with you.

850
01:12:59,570 --> 01:13:01,370
I obliterate myself.

851
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:03,490
I merge into you, my child.

852
01:13:03,730 --> 01:13:06,010
Don't be afraid.
I am with you.

853
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:08,130
I am your guardian angel.

854
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:15,530
It is 5:00 in the morning,
and the sun has just risen.

855
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:17,890
The doors are thrown open.

856
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:19,930
No, wait.

857
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:25,010
First a horrible scream
echoes through the house.

858
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:30,690
A shapeless burning figure
moves across the floor,

859
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:32,170
...screaming.

860
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:33,610
I don't want to.

861
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:35,610
Let me go! Let me go!

862
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:15,850
The police are here
and insist on speaking to you.

863
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:28,570
Your husband,

864
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:30,970
His Grace the Bishop,

865
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:36,050
lost his life this morning
under terrible circumstances.

866
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:39,810
May I, madam?

867
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:46,370
We think we've been able to determine
the course of events.

868
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:51,370
Miss Elsa Bergius,
who was gravely ill, lay in bed.

869
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:54,050
On her bedside table stood a lamp.

870
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:56,810
By some unfortunate accident,
the lamp fell on the bed

871
01:14:56,970 --> 01:15:01,210
igniting her nightgown,
hair and bed linens.

872
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:05,450
Blazing like a torch,
she ran through the house

873
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:10,210
and by chance made it
into the Bishop's bedchamber.

874
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:17,290
According to His Grace's sister,
miss Henrietta Vergerus,

875
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:21,170
he was in a heavy sleep

876
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:22,730
from a soporific

877
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:26,930
you had given him earlier that night.

878
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:29,650
Miss Bergius flung herself on him,

879
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:32,650
igniting his bedclothes
and nightshirt.

880
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:35,290
His grace woke up
and succeeded in freeing himself

881
01:15:35,370 --> 01:15:37,850
from the dying woman
who was still ablaze.

882
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:42,890
But he could not
extinguish the flames

883
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:45,060
that were now engulfing him.

884
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:50,020
Old Mrs. Vergerus found her son

885
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:54,380
with his body burnt
and face charred.

886
01:15:56,100 --> 01:16:00,540
He showed faint signs of life
and said he was in unbearable agony.

887
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:06,780
Although I can't overlook the fact

888
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:11,820
that the sleeping aid you gave him
possibly made the disaster worse,

889
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:15,220
I also cannot attach
any serious importance to it.

890
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:19,100
Therefore, I must characterize the event
as an ill-fated coincidence

891
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:22,460
of extremely unfortunate
circumstances.

892
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:53,060
My dear, dear friends.

893
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,740
I am more moved than I can say.

894
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,940
My wisdom is simple.

895
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:12,820
There are those who despise it,
but I don't give a damn -

896
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:15,900
forgive me, mama.
I noticed you raised your right eyebrow.

897
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:19,020
You think your son is talking too much.
Don't worry. I will be brief.

898
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:22,460
Therefore... and consequently...

899
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:28,900
we Ekdahls have not come
into the world to see through it.

900
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,020
Never think that.

901
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:35,700
We are not equipped
for such excursions.

902
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:40,060
We might just as well ignore
the big things.

903
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:46,740
We must live in the little world.

904
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:50,660
We will be content with that

905
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:55,420
and cultivate it
and make the best of it.

906
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:00,980
Suddenly death strikes.

907
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:06,380
Suddenly the abyss opens.

908
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:11,100
Suddenly the storm howls,
and disaster is upon us.

909
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:13,380
All that we know.

910
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:17,420
But let us not think
of all that unpleasantness.

911
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:21,860
We Ekdahls love our subterfuges.

912
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:27,740
Rob a man of his subterfuges
and he goes mad and begins lashing out.

913
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:32,150
Damn it all,
people must be intelligible!

914
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:36,670
Otherwise we don't dare to love them
or speak ill of them.

915
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:41,990
We must be able to grasp
the world and reality

916
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:47,070
so we can complain of their monotony
with a clear conscience.

917
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:53,710
Don't be sad, dear splendid artists.

918
01:18:55,390 --> 01:19:00,070
Actors and actresses,
we need you all the same.

919
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:05,990
It is you who must give us
our supernatural shivers,

920
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:09,910
or better yet,
our innermost diversions.

921
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:17,790
The world is a den of thieves
and night is falling.

922
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:23,510
Evil breaks its chains
and runs through the world like a mad dog.

923
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:27,750
The poison affects us all,

924
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:30,750
us Ekdahls and everyone else.

925
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:38,910
No one escapes, not even
Helena Viktoria or little Aurora.

926
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:43,550
So it shall be.

927
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:50,950
Therefore let us be happy
while we are happy.

928
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:56,430
Let us be kind, generous,
affectionate and good.

929
01:19:57,630 --> 01:20:01,390
It is necessary,
and not at all shameful...

930
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:06,230
to take pleasure in the little world.

931
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:09,870
Good food...

932
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:12,750
gentle smiles...

933
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:18,470
fruit trees in bloom, waltzes.

934
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:24,390
My dearest friends,
Im done talking,

935
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:26,310
and you can take it as you like:

936
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:30,950
The sentimental ramblings
of an uneducated restaurateur

937
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:33,270
or the pitiful babbling of an old man.

938
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:35,230
I don't care.

939
01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:52,350
I hold a little empress in my arms.

940
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:59,670
It's tangible yet immeasurable.

941
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:05,670
One day she will prove
everything I just said wrong.

942
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:10,630
One day she will not only rule
the little world,

943
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,200
but everything.

944
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:15,880
Everything.

945
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,960
Be a good girl now,
so that mama can go to bed.

946
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:30,480
I think you've finished eating,
in any case.

947
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,440
- I'll take her.
- Thank you, Rosa.

948
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,960
- How do you like it here?
- Everyone's so kind.

949
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,240
Especially Mr. Ekdahl.

950
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:43,560
He must be a real friend of humanity.

951
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,600
That he certainly is.

952
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:49,680
He's particularly kind to young girls,
so you watch out, Rosa.

953
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,360
Oh, my!

954
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,280
- Good night, madam.
- Good night, Rosa.

955
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,720
Come on, you're tired.

956
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:10,160
- Oh no, let's stay.
- Let's go to bed.

957
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,000
We're going to have champagne.

958
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:15,840
If you're a good boy, I'll bring you
a beer and sandwich in bed.

959
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:21,560
I'm sure Emilie will want
a glass of champagne.

960
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:24,840
We'll raise a toast to our daughters.

961
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,000
Go to bed now, Gusten.

962
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:30,520
I'm so damned happy!

963
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:35,640
That's nice, Gusten,
but you'll have a headache tomorrow.

964
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:38,640
Imagine: We're together again.

965
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,880
I'm going to the country tomorrow
to speak with the workmen.

966
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:49,840
Do you need anything taken care of?

967
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:53,320
- I'll be there until Thursday.
- I'll come on Tuesday.

968
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,800
Don't you think I have
the best wife in the world?

969
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,560
Much better than you deserve.

970
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:03,120
And the world's
prettiest little mistress.

971
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,560
A real darling.

972
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,200
- Are you going in the morning?
- Not until 2:00.

973
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:15,600
When I see you,
I want to weep with joy.

974
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,240
To think you're back with us again!

975
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,440
- Good night, Gusten.
- Good night.

976
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,920
Be a good boy now, and remember
that Alma needs her sleep.

977
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:33,650
I know what Alma needs.

978
01:24:00,010 --> 01:24:01,090
Aunt Emilie.

979
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:05,530
- What do you two want at this hour?
- We want to move to Stockholm.

980
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:09,130
Marianne Egerman is opening
a boutique and wants us to help.

981
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:12,130
- And we'd like to.
- We'd very much like to.

982
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:15,250
But we have a big problem.

983
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:17,850
Papa insists on that cafe for Maj.

984
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:19,530
He's so kind.

985
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:24,890
- Maj's had enough of his tutelage.
- He's so kind.

986
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:28,610
She wants to live her own life
and decide for herself and her baby.

987
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:30,690
I don't know what to do.

988
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:32,290
We've spoken to mama.

989
01:24:32,330 --> 01:24:36,170
She was awfully upset at first
and said we couldn't do that to papa.

990
01:24:36,450 --> 01:24:40,690
Then she calmed down and said
that life must take its course...

991
01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:43,890
and that one shouldn't force
one's children.

992
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:46,690
Though she felt sorry
for papa's sake.

993
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:49,250
It's awful.

994
01:24:49,650 --> 01:24:51,570
You must think of yourself.

995
01:24:51,690 --> 01:24:55,610
After all, papa's an old man.
Isn't that true, aunt Emilie?

996
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:58,370
Go to bed now.
I'll have a word with grandmama.

997
01:25:44,690 --> 01:25:47,210
Emilie, how nice to see you!
Welcome!

998
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:49,130
I need to speak with you.

999
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:51,090
- Would you like a cognac?
- No, thank you.

1000
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:52,810
Is it anything serious?

1001
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:56,410
Oh, yes. Maj and Petra
want to move to Stockholm.

1002
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:58,380
What do you think?

1003
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:25,060
You can't escape me.

1004
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:32,500
One other thing.

1005
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:34,060
You're right.

1006
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:38,220
On his deathbed, Oscar asked you
to take charge of the theatre.

1007
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:41,220
I was there.
I remember it well.

1008
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:43,180
Gustav Adolf will be awfully hurt.

1009
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:46,180
Why all this concern
for Gustav Adolf?

1010
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:48,940
He has a good head for business,

1011
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:51,860
but he doesn't know
a thing about theatre.

1012
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:54,540
It's your theatre, my dear Emilie.

1013
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:58,420
It's about time we explain
to our backwoods Napoleon

1014
01:26:58,620 --> 01:27:00,260
that he's facing his Waterloo.

1015
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:04,540
I'd like you to read a new play
by August Strindberg.

1016
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:08,020
That nasty misogynist!

1017
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:08,980
No, thank you.

1018
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:10,900
It's called a dream play.

1019
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,780
I thought we'd both perform in it.

1020
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:18,180
Not on your life.
I haven't appeared on stage in -

1021
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:21,980
all the more reason.
I won't disturb you any longer.

1022
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:25,700
You never disturb me.

1023
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,340
What are you laughing at?

1024
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:36,140
Now we're the ones in charge,
aren't we?

1025
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:37,740
Do you think so?

1026
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:42,660
- Good night, dearest.
- Good night, my dear.

1027
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:28,340
"Everything can happen.
Everything is possible and probable.

1028
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:31,660
Time and space do not exist.

1029
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:35,420
On a flimsy framework of reality,

1030
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:41,060
the imagination spins,
weaving new patterns."
