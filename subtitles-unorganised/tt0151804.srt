00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,035
which is why I work
at lnitech to begin with.

164
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,787
MICHAEL: Uh, yeah, well,
I work at lnitech...

165
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,872
and I don't consider myself
a pussy, OK?

166
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:01,291
SAMIR:
Yes. I am also not a pussy.

167
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,460
MICHAEL: They're gonna find out
the hard way I'm not a pussy...

168
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,212
if they don't start treating
their software people better.

169
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,797
SAMIR: That's right.

170
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,507
MICHAEL: They don't understand.

171
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,676
I could program a virus that'd
rip that place off big time.

172
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,302
PETER: Yeah.

173
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,512
MICHAEL: Big time.

174
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,557
STAN: Whoa!

175
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:17,724
There she is.

176
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,395
SAMIR: Peter, you know,
you always talk about this girl.

177
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,565
If you're so obsessed with her,
why don't you just ask her out?

178
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,732
Oh, I can't do that.

179
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:28,026
I'm just another
asshole customer.

180
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,654
You can't just walk up
to a waitress and ask her out.

181
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,739
Besides, I'm still trying
to work it out with Anne.

182
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,577
Oh, that reminds me.
I can't play poker on Friday.

183
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,953
Why not?

184
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:42,040
I'm gonna see this occupational
hypnotherapist with Anne.

185
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,501
Dude,
an occupational hypnotherapist?

186
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,962
PETER:
I know. Anne wants me to go.

187
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,255
She thinks it might help.

188
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,008
Um...

189
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,510
You know,
sometimes I think that...

190
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,096
I get thinking
that she's cheating on me.

191
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,556
Yeah. I know what you mean.

192
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,099
Yeah.

193
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,476
What is that supposed to mean?

194
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:03,979
Nothing.

195
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,274
Why don't you just tell Anne
that you're not into hypnosis...

196
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:08,442
and you wanna play poker
with us?

197
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,068
I can't do that.
She'll get all pissed off...

198
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,531
and, besides, I think the guy
might actually be able to help.

199
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,116
I mean,
he did help Anne lose weight.

200
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,410
Peter, she's anorexic.

201
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,287
Yeah, I know.

202
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,663
The guy's really good.

203
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,334
Yeah, well, I don't think any
occupational hypnotherapist...

204
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,127
is gonna help you solve
any of your problems.

205
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:28,921
Hey, and speaking of problems...

206
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,464
what's this I hear about you
having problems...

207
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:31,840
with your T.P.S. reports?

208
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,218
SAMIR:
Yeah. Didn't you get that memo?

209
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,472
TOM: Hey! Hey, guys! Peter!

210
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,098
SAMIR: ls that Smykowski?

211
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,142
-Samir!
-What's he doing?

212
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,894
MICHAEL: Oh, probably workin' on
another heart attack.

213
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:45,771
TOM: I've been lookin'
all over for you guys!

214
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,565
Have you seen this?
I knew it. I knew it.

215
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,275
PETER: What?
It's a staff meeting. So what?

216
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,903
TOM: So what?
We're all screwed. That's what.

217
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:54,613
They're gonna downsize lnitech.

218
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,907
SAMIR: What are you talking
about? How do you know that?

219
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:59,159
TOM: How do I know? They're
bringing in a consultant.

220
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,327
That's how I know.

221
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:02,162
That's what this staff meeting's
all about.

222
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,039
It happened
at lnitrode last year.

223
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,874
You have to interview
with this consultant.

224
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,668
They call them
efficiency experts...

225
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,919
but what you're really doing...

226
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,337
is interviewing
for your own job.

227
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,755
MICHAEL: Every week you say
you're gonna lose your job...

228
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,006
and you're still here.

229
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,509
TOM: Not this time. I bet
I'm the first one laid off.

230
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,678
The thought of having to go to
the state unemployment office...

231
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,805
and stand in line
with those scumbags...

232
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,223
SAMIR: Shit.

233
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,309
TOM: You know there are people
in this world...

234
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,812
that don't have to put up
with all this shit?

235
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:29,022
Like that guy
that invented the pet rock.

236
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,276
You see,
that's what you have to do.

237
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,195
You have to use your mind...

238
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:37,364
and come up with some really
great idea like that...

239
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,783
and you can make millions--
never have to work again.

240
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,994
MICHAEL: You think the pet rock
was a really great idea?

241
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,871
Sure it was.

242
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,039
The guy made a million dollars.

243
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,461
You know, I had an idea
like that once...

244
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:52,921
a long time ago.

245
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,632
PETER: Really? What was it, Tom?

246
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,218
Well, all right.

247
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,222
It was
a "Jump to Conclusions" mat.

248
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,143
You see, it would be this mat...

249
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:08,395
that you would
put on the floor...

250
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:12,691
and it would have different
conclusions written on it...

251
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,027
that you could jump to.

252
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,409
MICHAEL: That is the worst idea
I've ever heard in my life, Tom.

253
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:26,121
SAMIR: Yes. Yes, it's horrible,
this idea.

254
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,209
Uh, look...

255
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,543
I gotta get outta here.

256
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,462
I'll see you guys later...

257
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:35,464
if I still have a job.

258
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,424
MICHAEL: Yeah.

259
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,301
Our high school
guidance counselor...

260
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:41,720
used to ask us what you would do
if you had a million dollars...

261
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:42,888
didn't have to work...

262
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,183
and whatever you'd say
was supposed to be your career.

263
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,684
So if you wanted
to fix old cars...

264
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,603
then you're supposed
to be an auto mechanic.

265
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:50,729
SAMIR: So what did you say?

266
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,648
I never had an answer.

267
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,400
I guess that's why
I'm working at lnitech.

268
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,944
No. You're working at lnitech...

269
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,071
'cause that question
is bullshit to begin with.

270
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,781
If everyone listened to her,
there'd be no janitors...

271
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,158
because no one would clean shit
if they had a million dollars.

272
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,619
SAMIR: You know what I would do
if I had a million dollars?

273
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,872
I would invest half of it
in glorious mutual funds...

274
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,333
and then take the other half
to my friend Asadulah...

275
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,501
who works in securities--

276
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:14,753
MICHAEL: Samir. Samir,
you're missing the point.

277
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,463
The point of the exercise is
you're supposed to figure out...

278
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,966
what you would want to do if--

279
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,970
"PC load letter"?
What the fuck does that mean?

280
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,072
[Turns on television]

281
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,953
LAWRENCE: Hey, Peter, man!
Check out channel nine!

282
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,204
Check out this chick!

283
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,707
Damn it! Lawrence,
can't you just pretend...

284
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,792
Iike we can't hear
each other through the wall?

285
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,128
LAWRENCE: Oh, sorry, man!
Anne over there or somethin'?

286
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,296
No, but...

287
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,799
If you want to talk to me,
just come over.

288
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:07,264
Hey, man, check this out, dude.

ANNOUNCER:
The key is early detection.

290
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,312
Tumors that are detected--

291
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,314
Aw, jeez, Lawrence.

292
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,149
LAWRENCE: Sorry, man. I thought
you'd want to see this.

293
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,693
Doesn't that chick
look like Anne?

294
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,320
Yeah.

295
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,654
A little bit. I...

296
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,531
Hey, she hasn't been over here
in a while.

297
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:25,991
You two still goin' out?

298
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:27,701
Yeah.

299
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,286
I guess. I--I don't know.

300
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:31,663
Sometimes I get the feeling
like she's cheating on me.

301
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,832
Yeah. I get that feeling,
too, man.

302
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:36,793
What do you mean by that?

303
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:38,378
I don't know, man.

304
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,548
I just get that feeling
lookin' at her, like...

305
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,884
she's the type of chick
that just...

306
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,094
Uhh.

307
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,183
Oh, I'm sorry, man. Look, l--I--

308
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,352
You know,
I'm talkin' outta my ass.

309
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,770
PETER: Forget it. Don't worry.
It's all right.

310
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,563
Just--I had a rough day.

311
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,273
LAWRENCE: Tell me about it, man.

312
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,733
Ohh...

313
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:02,569
Ooh, I gotta wake my ass up...

drag up to Las Golindas.

316
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,702
I'm doin' the drywall up there
at the new McDonald's.

317
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,496
Let me ask you something.

318
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,124
When you come in on Monday, and
you're not feelin' real well...

319
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,376
does anyone ever say to you...

320
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,878
"Sounds like someone
has a case of the Mondays"?

321
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:22,714
No.

322
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:24,967
No, man.

323
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,678
Shit, no, man.

324
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,347
You'd get your ass kicked,
sayin' something like that, man.

325
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:32,015
PETER: Huh.

326
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,517
LAWRENCE: We still goin' fishin'
this weekend?

327
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,686
Ah, Lumbergh's gonna have me
come in on Saturday.

328
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:36,854
I just know it.

329
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,355
LAWRENCE: Well, you can
get out of that easily.

330
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,482
PETER: Yeah? How?

331
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:41,692
Well...

332
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,236
when a boss wants you
to work on Saturday...

333
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:47,239
he generally asks you
at the end of the day, right?

334
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:48,407
PETER: Yeah.

335
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,492
LAWRENCE: So all you gotta do is
avoid him--that's all right...

336
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,786
I got it--on the last few hours
on Friday...

337
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,705
duck out early...

338
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,373
turn off
your answering machine...

339
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,083
you should be home free, man.

340
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,212
That's a really good idea.

341
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,256
Fuckin' "A," man.

342
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:09,887
Lawrence, what would you do
if you had a million dollars?

343
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,805
I'll tell you what I'd do, man.

344
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,142
Two chicks
at the same time, man.

345
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,106
That's it?

346
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,399
If you had a million dollars...

347
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:24,484
you'd do two chicks
at the same time?

348
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,321
Damn straight. I've always
wanted to do that, man.

349
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:30,199
I think if I were a millionaire,
I could hook that up, too...

350
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,992
'cause chicks dig dudes
with money.

351
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,452
Well, not all chicks.

352
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,330
The type of chicks that would
double up on a dude like me do.

353
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,497
Good point.

354
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,541
LAWRENCE: What about you, now?
What would you do?

355
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,001
Besides two chicks
at the same time?

356
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,252
Well, yeah.

357
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:43,837
Nothing.

358
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,964
Nothin', huh?

359
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,175
I would relax.

360
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,385
I would sit on my ass all day.

361
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,722
I would do nothing.

362
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,391
You don't need a million dollars
to do nothin', man.

363
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,893
Take a look at my cousin.

364
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,937
He's broke, don't do shit.

365
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:05,817
NINA: Corporate accounts
payable. Nina speaking.

366
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,319
Just a moment.

367
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,821
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

368
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,782
Just a moment.

369
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:14,076
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

370
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,702
Just a moment.

371
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:18,413
BILL:
So, you should ask yourself...

372
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:21,083
with every decision you make...

373
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,252
"ls this good for the company?

374
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,045
"Am I helping with..."

375
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:26,588
PETER: ls that the guy?

376
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,841
TOM: Yeah. We're screwed.

377
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,426
BILL: OK, then, um...

378
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:34,972
I'd like to go ahead
and welcome, uh...

379
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,391
a new member to our team here.

380
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,767
This is, uh...

381
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:41,353
Bob Slydell.

382
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,982
Yeah. Uh...

383
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,401
Bob is a consultant.

384
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:51,071
Yeah. He's gonna be
sort of, uh...

385
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:53,740
helping us out...

386
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,242
a little here...

387
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:56,743
asking some questions...

388
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,328
maybe seeing
if there are some ways...

389
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,039
we can make things run
a little more smoothly...

390
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,249
around here.

391
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,127
Yeah.

392
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:07,546
Oh, and remember, next Friday...

393
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,923
is Hawaiian shirt day.

394
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:15,554
So, you know, if you want to,
go ahead and, uh....

395
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:17,181
wear a Hawaiian shirt and jeans.

396
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,101
And I said I don't care
if they lay me off, either.

397
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:22,352
Because I told Bill...

398
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,897
that if they move my desk
one more time...

399
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,733
then I'm--I'm quitting.
I'm going to quit...

400
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,276
and I told Dom, too...

401
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:32,613
because they've moved my desk
four times already this year...

402
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,823
and I used to be over
by the window...

403
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:38,118
and I could see the squirrels,
and they were married...

404
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,412
but then they switched
from the Swingline...

405
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,915
to the Boston stapler, but
I kept my Swingline stapler...

406
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:44,917
because it didn't
bind up as much...

407
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,544
and I kept the staples
for the Swingline stapler.

408
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:48,712
PETER: OK, Milton.

409
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,923
MILTON: No, it's not OK,
because if they make me--

410
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:54,426
If they take my stapler,
then I'll--I'll--I'll--

411
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,762
I'll set the building on fire.

412
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:59,014
PETER:
OK, well, that sounds great.

413
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,849
Uh, I'll talk to you later,
all right? Bye.

414
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,100
MILTON: Peter--

415
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:19,243
BILL: Good-bye.

416
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,100
Come on.

417
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,229
Oh, for cryin'--

418
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,545
Hello, Peter. What's happening?

419
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:13,255
Um...

420
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:15,257
I'm gonna need you...

421
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,176
to go ahead
and come in tomorrow...

422
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:21,388
so if you could be here
around...

423
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,932
nine, that would be great.

424
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,184
OK?

425
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,937
Oh, oh, and I almost forgot.

426
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,772
Um...

427
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,609
I'm also gonna need you
to go ahead and come in...

428
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,236
on Sunday, too, OK?

429
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:37,946
We, um...

430
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,823
Iost some people this week...

431
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,950
and, uh...

432
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:44,036
we need to sort of play
catch-up.

433
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,329
Thanks.

434
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:50,959
PETER: So I was sitting
in my cubicle today...

435
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:55,005
and I realized, ever since
I started working, um...

436
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:58,800
every single day of my life
has been worse than...

437
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:00,511
the day before it.

438
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:05,182
So that means that every single
day that you see me...

439
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,018
that's on the worst day
of my life.

440
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,229
What about today?

441
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,563
Is today
the worst day of your life?

442
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,233
-Yeah.
-Wow. That's messed up.

443
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,695
I'm sorry.

444
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:19,988
Go on.

445
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:23,575
PETER: ls there any way
that you could sort of...

446
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:26,453
just zonk me out so that, like,
I don't know...

447
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,956
that I'm at work...in here?

448
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,457
Could I come home...

449
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:34,002
and think that I've been fishing
all day or something?

450
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,755
That's...really not what I do,
Peter.

451
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,131
Heh.

452
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,341
However...

453
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,886
the good news is,
I think I can help you.

454
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:46,014
I want you to do something
for me, Peter.

455
00:21:47,683 --> 00:21:49,893
I want you to try and relax.

456
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:56,441
I want you to relax
every muscle in your body...

457
00:21:56,483 --> 00:22:00,779
beginning with your toes
to your fingertips.

458
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,701
Now I want you
to relax your legs.

459
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:09,705
You're beginning to feel
your eyelids getting heavy...

460
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:13,083
as you slip deeper and deeper...

461
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,503
into a state
of complete relaxation.

462
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:20,716
All your cares and concerns
are disappearing.

463
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,301
Deeper and deeper.

464
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,303
Way down.

465
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,555
Your concern about your job...

466
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,600
melts away...

467
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:31,602
way...

468
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:33,103
way down.

469
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:34,521
Unh.

470
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:38,984
Now, when I count backwards
from three...

471
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:42,487
you'll be in a state
of complete relaxation.

472
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:45,532
Your worries, cares,
and inhibitions will be gone...

473
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:48,202
and you will remain
in that state...

474
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:51,747
until I snap my fingers.

475
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,290
Three.

476
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:55,083
Deeper and deeper.

477
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:56,793
Way...

478
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:58,337
way down.

479
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,380
Two.

480
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,466

that we did start

Peter, what's gotten into you?

First, you just sit there
while Dr. Swanson dies...

00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:21,563
then you walk out and embarrass
me in front of my friends...

00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:23,315
and don't blame this
on hypnosis, either.

is you take the specifications

to the software engineers?

Well, then I just have to ask...

why couldn't the customers...

00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:29,191
just take them directly
to the software people, huh?

TOM: Well, I'll tell you why.

578

you physically take the specs
from the customer?

Well...

583
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:51,755

say you do here?

Well, look,
I already told you.

593
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:12,860
I deal with
the goddamn customers...

594
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:14,778
so the engineers don't have to.

595

I have people skills.

with people!

to the pop singer?

607

MICHAEL: No, it's--it's
just a coincidence.

608
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:52,024

To be honest with you...

609
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:53,734

know if it gets any better...

612

than when he sings
"When a Man Loves a Woman."

613
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,201
But you must really
love his music, huh?

he's pretty--
he's pretty good, I guess.

617
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,875
You're goddamn right, he is.

620
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,257
Mmm...

621

[Michael clears throat]

00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,054
I don't--I don't know.
Heh heh.

623
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:24,473
I mean, I guess I sort
of like them all.

624
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:27,684
SLYDELL: That's a riot.
I'm the exact same way.

625
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:29,019
But it must be twice
as hard for you...

626
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:30,521
being you have
the same name as him.

627
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:33,482
I celebrate
the guy's entire catalog.

628
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:36,026
Anyway, let's get down
to business, Michael.

629
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:38,278
You know,
you can just call me Mike.

630
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:44,868
Hi.

631
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,203
Hey.

632
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:51,041
I wonder if I'm allowed
to, uh, wear this in here?

633
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,210
I think it would be OK.

634
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:56,004
Would you like to sit down?

635
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:57,256
OK.

Yeah. Is it?

JOANNA: Yeah, my God,
compared to Chotchkie's!

I like the uniforms better,
anyways.

642
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,106
I like yours.

643
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:15,315
JOANNA: Ugh!

644
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:20,195
"We're not in Kansas anymore."

645
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:22,322
JOANNA: Yeah.

646
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:24,783
Really. Ha ha.

647
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:26,243
It's on your...

648
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:29,788
Ohh! Yeah. That's...

649
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,832
That's, uh...

650
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:34,835
That's one of my--
my pieces of flair.

651
00:30:34,877 --> 00:30:36,003
PETER:
What's a "piece of flair"?

652
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:38,088
JOANNA:
Oh, it's, uh, where, you know...

653
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,717
Iike these suspenders and, uh,
buttons, they're all sort of...

654
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,844
We're actually required
to wear...

655
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:46,889
um, fifteen pieces of flair.

656
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,141
It's really stupid, actually.

657
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:50,434
Do you get to pick 'em
yourself?

658
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:51,935
JOANNA: Yeah, yeah, we do.

659
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:53,187
Although I didn't actually
choose these.

660
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:57,566
I just sort of grabbed,
you know, fifteen buttons.

661
00:30:57,608 --> 00:31:00,277
I don't even know what they say.
I don't really care.

662
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:02,613
I don't really like
talking about my flair.

663
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:04,114
OK.

664
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:07,159
JOANNA:
So, where do you, work, Peter?

665
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:08,744
PETER: lnitech.

666
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:10,579
JOANNA: And--Yeah?
What--what do you do there?

667
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:13,457
I sit in a cubicle...

668
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:16,460
and I update bank software
for the 2000 switch.

669
00:31:17,878 --> 00:31:19,046
What's that?

670
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:21,298
PETER: Well, see, they wrote
all this bank software...

671
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,300
and, uh, to save space...

672
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:25,135
they used two digits
for the date instead of four.

673
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:28,138
So like 98 instead of 1998.

674
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,391
Uh, so I go through these
thousands of lines of code...

675
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:34,269
and, uh...
It doesn't really matter.

676
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:37,231
I, uh, I don't like my job,
and, uh...

677
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:39,566
I don't think I'm gonna go
anymore.

678
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,110
You're just not gonna go?

679
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:43,362
PETER: Yeah.

680
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:44,571
Won't you get fired?

681
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:46,740
I don't know.

682
00:31:46,782 --> 00:31:50,577
But I really don't like it,
and, uh, I'm not gonna go.

683
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:52,871
So you're gonna quit?

684
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:56,083
Nah-uh. Not really. Uh...

685
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:57,709
I'm just gonna stop going.

686
00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:01,088
PETER: What?

687
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:03,215
Uh, when did you decide
all that?

688
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:04,383
PETER: About an hour ago.

689
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:05,884
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

690
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:07,094
JOANNA: An hour ago.

691
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,013
So you're gonna get another job?

692
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:12,224
I don't think I'd like
another job.

693
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:16,186
Well, what are you going to do
about money and bills and--

694
00:32:16,228 --> 00:32:18,772
You know, I've never
really liked paying bills.

695
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:20,274
I don't think
I'm gonna do that, either.

696
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:23,527
Ahh...

697
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,696
well, so what do you want to do?

698
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:27,698
I want to take you
out to dinner...

699
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:30,117
and then I want to go back to my
apartment and watch "Kung Fu."

700
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:31,451
Do you ever watch "Kung Fu"?

701
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,372
I love "Kung Fu."

702
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:37,708
-Channel 39.
-Totally.

703
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:39,543
PETER: You should come over
and watch "Kung Fu" tonight.

704
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:41,545
-OK.
-Great.

705
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:43,797
OK. Can we order lunch first?

706
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,382
-Yeah.
-OK.

707
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:49,511
[Mumbles]

708
00:32:52,931 --> 00:32:54,766
[Inaudible conversation]

709
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:03,066
BILL:
Took a stapler off my desk...

710
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:09,615
[Laughter]

711
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:12,367
BILL: Anyway, sounds great, Bob.
See you in a few.

712
00:33:15,037 --> 00:33:17,581
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

713
00:33:17,706 --> 00:33:19,208
MILTON: Nothing.

714
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:21,210
BILL: I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead...

715
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:23,545
and move your desk
again, so...

716
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:26,381
if you could go ahead
and get it as far back...

717
00:33:26,423 --> 00:33:28,342
against that wall as possible...

718
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:29,635
that would be great.

719
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:31,220
MILTON: No, because I was--

720
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:32,763
BILL: That way,
we'll have some room...

721
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:34,681
for some of these boxes
and things...

722
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:37,851
we need to put in here,
and, uh...

723
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:41,355
Oh. Oh, there it is.

724
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:44,149
Here, let me just go ahead
and get that from you.

725
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:46,193
[Milton moans]

726
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:47,528
Great.

727
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:52,032
So if you could just get to that
as soon as possible...

728
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:54,826
that would be terrific, OK?

729
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:57,621
Thanks a bunch, Milton.
Good-bye.

730
00:33:57,663 --> 00:33:59,873
[Mumbles] OK.

731
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:03,335
I could set the building
on fire.

732
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:08,632
-Peter.
-Michael.

733
00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:09,800
What the hell's going on, man?

734
00:34:09,842 --> 00:34:11,677
I thought you'd come in here
and start shooting.

735
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:13,804
No. I just came to get
my address book.

736
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:15,055
I'm not gonna stay.

737
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:17,432
I got a phone number,
Mike, that I don't wanna lose.

738
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:19,226
MICHAEL: What?
Peter, you're in deep shit.

739
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:21,270
You were supposed to come in
Saturday. What were you doing?

740
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:25,023
PETER: Michael, I did nothing.

741
00:34:25,023 --> 00:34:26,525
I did absolutely nothing...

742
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:29,570
and it was everything
that I thought it could be.

743
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,239
MICHAEL: I hope you have
a better story for Lumbergh.

744
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:34,867
You're supposed to be at your
interview with the consultants.

745
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:36,118
PETER: The who?

746
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,495
MICHAEL: The consultants.
What has gotten into you?

747
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:43,709
PETER: Oh, yeah...right.

748
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:47,546
MICHAEL: Wait, Peter.
You gotta postpone it, man.

749
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:48,672
Tell 'em you've been sick.
Make something up.

750
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:50,924
Oh, no way. No, I feel great.

751
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:52,801
It's the best day of my life.

752
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:57,431
SLYDELL: Next batter
looks like a Peter Gibbons.

753
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:58,640
PORTER: Uh-huh.

754
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:00,934
SLYDELL: Ah, there you are.
We were just talking about you.

755
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:02,644
You must be Peter Gibbons.

756
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:04,062
Uh-huh. Terrific.

757
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:06,565
I'm Bob Slydell. This is
my associate Bob Porter.

758
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:08,066
PETER: Oh, hi, Bob. Bob.

759
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:10,611
SLYDELL: Grab a seat
and join us for a minute or two.

760
00:35:12,154 --> 00:35:13,906
You see, what we're
actually trying to do here...

761
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:16,950
is we're just,
we're trying to get a feel...

762
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,869
for how people spend their day
at work.

763
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:20,621
So if you would...

764
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:24,249
would you walk us through
a typical day for you?

765
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:27,753
-Yeah.
-Great.

766
00:35:27,753 --> 00:35:31,256
PETER: Well, I generally come in
at least fifteen minutes late.

767
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:33,800
Uh, I use the side door.

768
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,803
That way Lumbergh can't see me.

769
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:40,807
And after that, I just sort of
space out for about an hour.

770
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:43,393
PORTER: Uh, "space out"?

771
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:44,603
PETER: Yeah.

772
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:46,480
I just stare at my desk.

773
00:35:46,522 --> 00:35:48,023
But it looks like I'm working.

774
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:51,944
I do that for probably
another hour after lunch, too.

775
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:53,779
I'd say in a given week...

776
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,697
I probably only do
about fifteen minutes...

777
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:58,617
of real, actual work.

778
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:03,372
SLYDELL: Peter,
would you be a good sport...

779
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:05,415
and indulge us and just...

780
00:36:05,457 --> 00:36:06,500
tell us a little more?

781
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:08,085
Oh, yeah.

782
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:11,797
Let me tell you something
about T.P.S. reports.

783
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,006
Ahh...

784
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:16,510
The thing is, Bob,
it's not that I'm lazy.

785
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,554
It's that I just don't care.

786
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:20,764
PORTER: Don't...don't care?

787
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:23,392
It's a problem of motivation,
all right?

788
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:25,060
Now, if I work my ass off...

789
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:27,020
and lnitech
ships a few extra units...

790
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,897
I don't see another dime.

791
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:30,524
So where's the motivation?

792
00:36:31,316 --> 00:36:33,235
And here's something else,
Bob...

793
00:36:33,277 --> 00:36:35,237
I have eight different bosses
right now.

794
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:36,405
-I beg your pardon?
-Eight bosses.

795
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:37,573
-Eight?
-Eight, Bob.

796
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:40,367
So that means that
when I make a mistake...

797
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:44,079
I have eight different people
coming by to tell me about it.

798
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:47,457
That's my only real motivation,
is not to be hassled.

799
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:48,750
That and the fear
of losing my job.

800
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,669
But you know, Bob...

801
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:52,379
that'll only make someone
work just hard enough...

802
00:36:52,421 --> 00:36:53,589
not to get fired.

803
00:36:54,256 --> 00:36:57,259
SLYDELL: Would you bear with me
for just a second, please?

804
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:58,594
PETER: OK.

805
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:01,597
SLYDELL: What if--
and believe me...

806
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:04,641
this is strictly hypothetical--

807
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:08,729
but what if you were offered
some kind of a stock option...

808
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,522
equity-sharing program?

809
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:11,857
Would that do anything for you?

810
00:37:11,899 --> 00:37:14,151
I don't know. I guess.
Listen, I'm gonna go.

811
00:37:14,193 --> 00:37:17,196
Uh, it's been really nice
talking to both of you guys.

812
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:18,530
-Yes.
-Absolutely.

813
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:21,200
SLYDELL: Pleasure's all on this
side of the table, trust me.

814
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:22,826
Good luck
with your layoffs, all right?

815
00:37:22,868 --> 00:37:24,703
I hope your firings
go really well.

816
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:25,913
-OK.
-Thanks a lot.

817
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:27,706
SLYDELL: Great. Wow.

818
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:37,716
BILL:
So, Peter, what's happening?

819
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:39,134
Listen, uh...

820
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:48,894
STAN: Joanna, would you
come here a minute, please?

821
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:50,854
JOANNA: Yeah.

822
00:37:50,896 --> 00:37:55,108
I'm sorry I was late, but I
was having lunch, and l, uh...

823
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,735
STAN: We need to talk about
your flair.

824
00:37:57,653 --> 00:38:00,489
JOANNA: Really?
l--I have fifteen pieces on.

825
00:38:00,531 --> 00:38:02,032
I also...

826
00:38:02,074 --> 00:38:05,285
STAN: Well, fifteen
is the minimum, OK?

827
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:06,453
JOANNA: Oh. OK.

828
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:08,455
STAN: Now, you know,
it's up to you whether or not...

829
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:11,416
you want to just
do the bare minimum or...

830
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:12,668
Well, like Brian, for example...

831
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:16,129
has thirty-seven pieces of flair
on today.

832
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:17,548
And a terrific smile.

833
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:19,883
OK, so you want me to wear more?

834
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,636
Look, Joanna...

835
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:23,804
Yeah?

836
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:25,764
People can get
a cheeseburger anywhere, OK?

837
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:28,892
They come to Chotchkie's for
the atmosphere and the attitude.

838
00:38:29,685 --> 00:38:31,061
OK? that's what
the flair's about.

839
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:32,771
-It's about fun.
-Yeah.

840
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:34,982
OK, so more then, yeah?

841
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:39,987
Look, we want you
to express yourself, OK?

842
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:44,491
Now if you feel that the bare
minimum is enough, then, OK...

843
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:47,411
but some people choose
to wear more...

844
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:49,288
and we encourage that, OK?

845
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:52,624
You do want to express yourself,
don't you?

846
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,877
Y-yeah.

847
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:57,379
OK, great, great.
That's all I ask.

848
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:58,964
OK.

849
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:02,885
SLYDELL: Right, so there's
three more people...

850
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,970
we can easily lose.

851
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:08,223
Then there's Tom Smykowski.

852
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:10,267
He's useless.

853
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:11,894
Gone.

854
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:13,562
DOM: Sounds good to me.

855
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:16,023
SLYDELL: Here's a peculiar...

856
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:18,358
-Uh, Milton Waddams.
-Who's he?

857
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,444
PORTER: You know, squirrelly
looking guy. Mumbles a lot.

858
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:21,612
DOM: Oh, yeah.

859
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:23,322
SLYDELL: We--we can't actually
find a record...

860
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:25,699
of him being
a current employee here.

861
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:27,618
PORTER: I looked into it
more deeply...

862
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:29,620
and I found that
apparently what happened...

863
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:32,414
is that he was laid off
five years ago...

864
00:39:32,456 --> 00:39:33,624
and no one ever
told him about it...

865
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:36,168
but through some kind of glitch
in the payroll department...

866
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,586
he still gets a paycheck.

867
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:40,506
So we just went ahead
and fixed the glitch.

868
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:41,632
BILL: Great.

869
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:44,426
DOM:
So, uh, Milton has been let go?

870
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:45,594
SLYDELL: Just a second there,
professor.

871
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:49,223
We, uh, we fixed the glitch.

872
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:51,433
So he won't be receiving
a paycheck anymore.

873
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:53,977
So it'll just work itself out
naturally.

874
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:57,105
PORTER: We always like to avoid
confrontation whenever possible.

875
00:39:57,147 --> 00:39:58,273
The problem is solved
from your end.

876
00:39:58,315 --> 00:39:59,441
[Laughter]

877
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:02,986
SLYDELL: I'd like to move us
right along to a Peter Gibbons.

878
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:05,614
Now, we had a chance
to meet this young man...

879
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:08,283
and, boy, that's just
a straight shooter...

880
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:10,077
with upper management
written all over him.

881
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:12,538
Eech. Ooh.

882
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:15,874
Yeah. Um...

883
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:17,209
I'm going to have to go ahead...

884
00:40:17,251 --> 00:40:19,461
and sort of disagree
with you there.

885
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:22,089
Yeah, uh, he's been
real flaky lately...

886
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:25,926
and I'm just not sure
that he's the caliber person...

887
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:28,262
that we would want
for upper management.

888
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:31,014
He's also been having
some problems...

889
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:32,933
with his T.P.S. reports.

890
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,978
PORTER: I'll handle this.

891
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:39,106
We feel...

892
00:40:39,147 --> 00:40:41,275
that the problem
isn't with Peter.

893
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:43,110
SLYDELL: Mm-mmm.

894
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:45,279
PORTER: It's that you haven't
challenged him enough...

895
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,446
to get him really motivated.

896
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:47,656
SLYDELL: There it is.

897
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:51,618
Yeah...Ah, well...

898
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,954
I'm just not sure about that
right now.

899
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:56,748
SLYDELL: Yeah, Bill, let me ask
you a real quick question here.

900
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:00,085
How much time would you say
you spend each week...

901
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:02,087
dealing with
these T.P.S. reports?

902
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:08,468
Yeah...

903
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:19,479
GETO BOYS RAPPING: Damn,
it feels good to be a gangsta

904
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:31,783
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta

905
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:34,453
A real gangsta ass nigger
plays his cards right

906
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:37,080
A real gangsta ass nigger
never runs his mouth

907
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:40,167
'Cause real gangsta ass
niggers don't start fights

908
00:41:40,209 --> 00:41:42,711
And niggers always
gotta hide here

909
00:41:42,753 --> 00:41:45,589
Showin' all his boys
how we shot 'em

910

Real gangsta ass niggers
don't flex nuts

911
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:50,594
'Cause real gangsta ass
niggers know they got 'em

912
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:53,680
And everything is cool
in the mind of a gangsta

913
00:41:53,722 --> 00:41:56,183
'Cause gangsta ass niggers
think deep

GETO BOYS RAPPING:
Although I was born in Jamaica

926
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:45,023
Now I'm in the U.S. making deals

927

Damn, it feels good

00:42:58,871 --> 00:43:01,248
Some got killed in the past

933
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,917
But this gangsta here
was a smart one

934
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:05,919
Started living for the Lord

941
00:43:30,027 --> 00:43:31,153
what's happening?

942
00:43:31,195 --> 00:43:34,531
Ahh, now,
are you going to go ahead...

943
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:38,493
and have those T.P.S. reports
for us this afternoon?

944
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:39,912
PETER: No.

00:43:41,163 --> 00:43:43,707
Ahh...yeah...

946
00:43:43,749 --> 00:43:45,667
So I guess we should
probably go ahead...

947
00:43:45,709 --> 00:43:48,670
and have a little talk, hmm?

948
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:51,715

I'm--I'm kinda busy.

949
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:55,594
In fact, I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead.

00:43:56,512 --> 00:43:57,721
Just come back another time.

951
00:43:57,763 --> 00:44:00,140
I got a meeting with the Bobs
in a couple of minutes.

952
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:03,393
BILL: Uh, I wasn't aware
of a meeting with them.

953
00:44:03,435 --> 00:44:05,604
PETER:
Yeah, they called me at home.

954
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:11,568
BILL: That sounds good, Peter.

955
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,820
And, uh, we'll go ahead and...

956
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:16,156
get this all fixed up for you.

957
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:17,324
Great.

958
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:19,868
[Mumbles]

959
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:25,082
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

960
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:26,291
[Mumbles]

961
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,669
I--I didn't receive
my paycheck this week.

962
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:33,340
Uh, you're going to have to talk
to payroll about that.

963
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:34,675
I did and they said--

964
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:36,593
BILL:
Milt, we're gonna go ahead...

965
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:40,389
and move you downstairs
into storage "B."

966
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,182
No, l--I...

967
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:46,186
BILL: New people are coming,
and we need the space.

968
00:44:46,228 --> 00:44:47,563
MILTON: But there's no space--

969
00:44:47,604 --> 00:44:51,191
BILL: So if you could go ahead
and pack your stuff...

970
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:52,985
and move it down there...

971
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:55,028
that would be terrific.

972
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,446
OK?

973
00:44:56,488 --> 00:44:58,532
MILTON: Uh, excuse me...

974
00:44:58,574 --> 00:45:04,162
I believe you have my stapler,
please. Hmm.

975
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:06,498
PORTER: You've been missing
a lot of work lately.

976
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,709
PETER: I wouldn't say
I've been missing it, Bob.

977
00:45:10,169 --> 00:45:11,461
PORTER: Good one.

978
00:45:11,503 --> 00:45:13,338
SLYDELL:
Oh, that's terrific, Peter.

979
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,550
I'm sure you've--you've heard
some of the rumors...

980
00:45:16,592 --> 00:45:18,343
circulating
around the hallways...

981
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:21,221
about how we're going to do
a little "housecleaning..."

982
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:22,556
with some software people.

983
00:45:22,556 --> 00:45:25,767
Well, Bob, I have heard that.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

984
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:27,853
PORTER: We'll be getting rid
of these people.

985
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:32,733
First, Mr. Samir Naga...

986
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:33,984
SLYDELL: Naga...

987
00:45:34,026 --> 00:45:37,279
PORTER: Naga-gonna work here
anymore, anyway.

988
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:40,782
And Mr. Mike Bolton.
Nobody's gonna miss him.

989
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:42,534
You're gonna layoff
Samir and Michael?

990
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:45,120
PORTER: Yeah. We're gonna bring
in some entry-level graduates.

991
00:45:45,162 --> 00:45:47,372
Farm some work out to Singapore,
that's the usual deal.

992
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:48,707
SLYDELL: It's standard
operating procedure.

993
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:50,959
PETER: Do they know this yet?

994
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:53,212
SLYDELL: No. No, of course not.

995
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:56,131
We find it's always better
to fire people on a Friday.

996
00:45:56,131 --> 00:45:58,383
Studies have
statistically shown...

997
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:00,052
there's less chance
of an incident...

998
00:46:00,093 --> 00:46:01,803
if you do it at the end
of the week.

999
00:46:01,845 --> 00:46:05,015
Peter, what we'd like to do
is put you into position...

1000
00:46:05,057 --> 00:46:08,769
to have as many
as four people...

1001
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,103
working right underneath you.

1002
00:46:10,145 --> 00:46:12,314
This is a big promotion, Pete.

1003
00:46:12,356 --> 00:46:15,067
So you're going
to fire Michael and Samir...

1004
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:16,902
and give me more money?

1005
00:46:18,904 --> 00:46:20,614
SLYDELL: Uh-huh.

1006
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:22,950
Wow!

1007
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:25,953
MICHAEL: Hmm. Yeah.

1008
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:28,830
That's it.
That's exactly what I need.

1009
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:30,207
Give it to me.

1010
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:31,750
Come on, you little fucker,
let's go.

1011
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:33,377
That's what I need.
Let's do that.

1012
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:35,963
Let's do exactly that,
you little fuck--

1013
00:46:36,004 --> 00:46:37,881
-Michael.
-Hey.

1014
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:39,299
PETER: Listen to me.

1015
00:46:41,802 --> 00:46:43,387
What are you doing tonight?

1016
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:47,850
PETER: Michael, there comes
a point in a man's life...

1017
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:50,435
and maybe that time for you
is now...

1018
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,232
when it doesn't hurt to start
thinking about the future.

1019
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:57,359
Uh, no offense there, Peter...

1020
00:46:57,401 --> 00:46:59,152
but speak for yourself there,
sport.

1021
00:46:59,152 --> 00:47:02,447
I'm not the one who's been
flakin' out at work.

1022
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:06,535
I know you had this religious
experience or whatever...

1023
00:47:06,577 --> 00:47:09,329
but get your shit together,
or you're gonna get canned.

1024
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,833
Yeah, and, uh, and l--Listen...

1025
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:15,669
That virus
you're always talking about...

1026
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,880
the one that could
rip off the company...

1027
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:19,381
for a bunch of money.

1028
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:20,716
Yeah, what about it?

1029
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:22,426
Well, how does it work?

1030
00:47:23,218 --> 00:47:24,636
It's pretty brilliant.

1031
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:26,805
What it does is every time
there's a bank transaction...

1032
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:29,349
where interest is computed--
there are thousands a day--

1033
00:47:29,391 --> 00:47:31,393
the computer ends up with
these fractions of a cent...

1034
00:47:31,435 --> 00:47:32,978
which it usually rounds off.

1035
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,397
What this does is it takes
those little remainders...

1036
00:47:35,439 --> 00:47:37,399
and puts it into an account.

1037
00:47:37,441 --> 00:47:40,152
-This sounds familiar.
-They did it in "Superman Ill."

1038
00:47:40,194 --> 00:47:41,403
PETER: Right, uh...

1039
00:47:41,445 --> 00:47:43,197
MICHAEL:
An underrated movie, actually.

1040
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:46,617
There were hackers that did it
in the seventies as well.

1041
00:47:46,658 --> 00:47:49,703
-So they check for this now.
-No, here's the thing.

1042
00:47:49,745 --> 00:47:53,040
Initech's so backed up with all
the software we're updating...

1043
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:54,249
they'd never notice.

1044
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:56,335
You're right.

1045
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:58,754
Even if they wanted to, they
couldn't check all that code.

1046
00:47:58,795 --> 00:48:01,757
MICHAEL: Thumbs up their asses.
Thumbs up their asses.

1047
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:05,761
PETER: So, Michael, what's
to stop you from doing this?

1048
00:48:05,802 --> 00:48:08,347
It's not worth the risk.
I got a good job.

1049
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:12,059
What if you didn't have
a good job?

1050
00:48:13,477 --> 00:48:14,728
MICHAEL: Cock gobblers!

1051
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:22,152
Samir and I are
the best programmers they got.

1052
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:24,404
You haven't been showin' up,
and you get to keep your job.

1053
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:26,323
Actually, I'm being promoted.

1054
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:29,034
-What?!
-I know, Michael.

1055
00:48:29,076 --> 00:48:31,620
It's completely unfair.

1056
00:48:31,662 --> 00:48:34,206
And I realized something today.

1057
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:37,209
It's not just about me
and my dream of doing nothing.

1058
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:39,211
It's about all of us together.

1059
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:44,258
I don't know what happened to me
at that hypnotherapist.

1060
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:46,844
Maybe it was just shock,
and it's wearing off now...

1061
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:49,596
but when I saw that fat man
keel over and die...

1062
00:48:49,638 --> 00:48:52,641
Michael, we don't have
a lot of time on this earth.

1063
00:48:52,683 --> 00:48:55,644
We weren't meant to spend it
this way.

1064
00:48:55,686 --> 00:48:58,939
Human beings were not meant
to sit in little cubicles...

1065
00:48:58,981 --> 00:49:00,983
staring at computer screens
all day...

1066
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:02,150
filling out useless forms...

1067
00:49:02,192 --> 00:49:03,861
and listening
to eight different bosses...

1068
00:49:03,902 --> 00:49:06,405
drone on
about mission statements.

1069
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:09,366
I told those fudgepackers
I liked Michael Bolton's music.

1070
00:49:09,408 --> 00:49:13,120
Ohh. That is not right, Michael.

1071
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:16,039
For five years now,
you've worked your ass off...

1072
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:20,169
hoping for a promotion,
profit sharing, or something.

1073
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:21,628
Five years...

1074
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,464
of your mid-twenties now gone.

1075
00:49:24,506 --> 00:49:25,799
And you're gonna
go in tomorrow...

1076
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:28,510
they're gonna throw you
out on the street.

1077
00:49:28,552 --> 00:49:30,345
You know why?

1078
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:34,850
So Bill Lumbergh's stock
will go up a quarter of a point.

1079
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:36,518
Ugh.

1080
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,687
Michael, let's make
that stock go down...

1081
00:49:38,729 --> 00:49:40,731
and let's take enough money
out of that place...

1082
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:44,067
so that we never have
to sit in a cubicle ever again.

1083
00:49:45,485 --> 00:49:47,487
Your software works, right?

1084
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:49,239
Of course it works.
That's not the point.

1085
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:52,784
Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't
know how to install it.

1086
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:55,412
I don't know the credit union's
software well enough. OK?

1087
00:49:55,454 --> 00:49:59,166
Yeah. But Samir does.

1088
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,667
SAMIR:
But that's not much money.

1089
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:01,960
PETER: That's the beauty of it.

1090
00:50:02,002 --> 00:50:06,089
Each withdrawal, it's a fraction
of a cent, too small to notice.

1091
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:08,383
But you take a few thousand
withdrawals a day...

1092
00:50:08,425 --> 00:50:09,885
you space it out
over a couple of years...

1093
00:50:09,927 --> 00:50:12,221
that's a few
hundred thousand dollars.

1094
00:50:12,262 --> 00:50:13,514
It's like "Superman Ill."

1095
00:50:13,555 --> 00:50:15,641
SAMIR: "Superman Ill"?

1096
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:19,394
I have to leave now.
I have to get my rsum ready.

1097
00:50:19,436 --> 00:50:23,690
PETER: For another job where
they can fire you for no reason?

1098
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:26,443
SAMIR:
That's right. If I'm lucky.

1099
00:50:26,485 --> 00:50:30,656
I'm tired of being
pushed around. Aren't you?

1100
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:33,492
Yes, but I'm not going to do
anything illegal.

1101
00:50:33,534 --> 00:50:35,994
Illegal?
Samir, this is America.

1102
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:38,080
Come on. Sit down.

1103
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:41,291
Come on. This isn't Riyadh.

1104
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:44,294
They're not going
to saw your hands off here.

1105
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:46,755
The worst they'd do is put you
for a couple of months...

1106
00:50:46,797 --> 00:50:50,217
into a white-collar,
minimum-security resort.

1107
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:53,929
Shit, we should be so lucky.
They have conjugal visits there.

1108
00:50:53,971 --> 00:50:55,639
-Really?
-Yes.

1109
00:50:55,681 --> 00:50:57,057
MICHAEL: Shit!

1110
00:50:57,057 --> 00:50:59,810
I'm a free man. I haven't had
a conjugal visit in six months.

1111
00:50:59,852 --> 00:51:01,645
So what do you think?

1112
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:04,189
This thing is actually
pretty fail-safe, Samir.

1113
00:51:04,273 --> 00:51:05,440
PETER: Samir?

1114
00:51:07,192 --> 00:51:09,987
You came here looking
for a land of opportunity.

1115
00:51:10,028 --> 00:51:13,198
And this is the knock
of that opportunity.

1116
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,617
Tomorrow is your last day
at lnitech.

1117
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:17,202
You have two options--

1118
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:19,705
unemployment
or early retirement.

1119
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:21,290
What's it gonna be?

1120
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:23,750
-I have a question.
-Yes?

1121
00:51:23,792 --> 00:51:27,546
In this conjugal visits,
you can have sex with women?

1122
00:51:27,588 --> 00:51:30,257
Yep, you sure can.

1123
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:35,053
OK, I'll do it.

1124
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:38,015
PETER: That's what I'm talkin'
about when I talk about America!

1125
00:51:38,056 --> 00:51:39,433
Can we discuss the plan?

1126
00:51:39,474 --> 00:51:41,226
OK, yeah, good, right.

1127
00:51:41,268 --> 00:51:42,728
It works like a computer virus.

1128
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:45,397
All we do is load it into
the credit union's mainframe.

1129
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,690
It'll do the rest.

1130
00:51:46,732 --> 00:51:49,109
PETER: Get me that disk,
and I'll take it from there.

1131
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:52,029
Before we go any further,
all right?

1132
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:54,573
We have to swear to God,
Allah...

1133
00:51:54,615 --> 00:51:57,159
that nobody knows about this
but us, all right?

1134
00:51:57,201 --> 00:52:00,287
No family members,
no girlfriends. Nobody.

1135
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:01,580
-Of course.
-Agreed.

1136
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:03,832
LAWRENCE: Don't worry, man!
I won't tell anyone, either.

1137
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:06,084
-What the fuck is that?
-Don't worry. He's cool.

1138
00:52:06,126 --> 00:52:09,588
PETER: All right. Here's how
I see it all going down.

1139
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:12,508
SLYDELL: Peter, congratulations.
This is one heck of a promotion.

1140
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:13,800
PETER: Thank you, Bob.

1141
00:52:13,842 --> 00:52:16,094
PORTER: We'll get some people
under you right away.

1142
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:23,810
ICE CUBE RAPPING:
I got something for your mind

1143
00:52:23,852 --> 00:52:25,521
Your body and your soul

1144
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:30,317
I got something for your mind

1145
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:31,902
Your body and your soul

1146
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:36,156
[Bang bang]

1147
00:52:38,158 --> 00:52:42,120
ICE CUBE RAPPING: Here comes
the big-headed naked ass dippin'

1148
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:44,373
Sippin' on Crevassier

1149
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:47,459
Goddamn,
I must have the floss today

1150
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:49,086
Now, pimpin' ain't easy

1151
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:50,629
But it's necessary

1152
00:52:50,712 --> 00:52:54,216
So I'm chasin' bitches
like Tom chases Jerry

1153
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:56,802
I put the pedal to the floor

1154
00:52:56,844 --> 00:52:59,763
In my two-tone Ford Explorer

1155
00:52:59,805 --> 00:53:02,099
You know how it's done

1156
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,684
Slammin', bumpin'

1157
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:07,312
Make that somethin' jump
on the one-ten

1158
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:09,857
She's flyin' in the Blazer

1159
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:11,984
Like no Speed Racer

1160
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:13,443
But I ain't gonna chase her

1161
00:53:13,485 --> 00:53:15,863
Like Racer X

1162
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:17,739
But I won't flex

1163
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:20,492
Till it's time to have sex

1164
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:22,786
So when you want
to get together?

1165
00:53:22,828 --> 00:53:27,666
'Cause you know a nigger like me
is down for whatever

1166
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:29,710
[Bang]

1167
00:53:41,847 --> 00:53:43,140
MICHAEL: That was easy.

1168
00:53:43,182 --> 00:53:45,225
Yeah, I guess it was.

1169
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:46,894
What'd you do with the--

1170
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:48,896
DREW: Hey, man.

1171
00:53:48,896 --> 00:53:50,606
PETER: Oh, hey, Drew.

1172
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:52,316
You guys hear
about Tom Smykowski?

1173
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:53,525
That he got laid off?

1174
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:55,068
No, man, check it out.

1175
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:57,696
Last week, after he found out
he was getting laid off...

1176
00:53:57,738 --> 00:54:01,116
he tries to kill himself by
running the car in the garage.

1177
00:54:01,158 --> 00:54:02,326
PETER: ls he dead?

1178
00:54:02,367 --> 00:54:03,952
DREW: No, man, check it out.

1179
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:07,164
His wife comes home early
and catches him.

1180
00:54:07,206 --> 00:54:09,082
DREW: He tries to play it off
like nothing happened.

1181
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:12,085
TOM: I was having some trouble
with the shifter here.

1182
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:13,504
It's jammed.

1183
00:54:13,545 --> 00:54:16,048
I--I couldn't get it
into drive.

1184
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:18,842
-I--I--I mean, reverse.
-You OK, Tom?

1185
00:54:18,884 --> 00:54:21,220
DREW:
Then as he's lookin' at her...

1186
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:23,263
he decides he wants to live.

1187
00:54:23,305 --> 00:54:24,848
TOM: Yeah, I think I'm OK.

1188
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:26,266
Right.

1189
00:54:26,308 --> 00:54:28,519
Seems to be working now.

1190
00:54:30,312 --> 00:54:32,064
See you later, honey.

1191
00:54:32,105 --> 00:54:33,315
Love ya.

1192
00:54:34,942 --> 00:54:38,862
DREW: But as soon as he backs
out of his driveway...Bam !

1193
00:54:38,904 --> 00:54:41,573
He gets slammed big-time
by a drunk driver.

1194
00:54:41,615 --> 00:54:43,575
-Is he OK?
-Sort of.

1195
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:46,828
Broke both his wrists, legs,
a couple of ribs, his back...

1196
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:49,081
but he's getting
a huge settlement out of this.

1197
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:50,332
Like seven figures.

1198
00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:51,917
He's getting out
of the hospital tomorrow.

1199
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:53,919
He's throwing a big party
this weekend to celebrate.

1200
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:55,963
We're all invited.

1201
00:54:56,004 --> 00:54:58,757
I'm thinking I might take
that new chick from logistics.

1202
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:01,301
Things go well, I might be
showing her my "Oh" face.

1203
00:55:01,343 --> 00:55:03,762
Oh, oh, oh...

1204
00:55:03,804 --> 00:55:06,890
You know what I'm talking about.
Oh.

1205
00:55:06,932 --> 00:55:09,142
Yeah. Right.

1206
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:10,477
See you guys there.

1207
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:15,023
MICHAEL:
Wow, our last day at lnitech.

1208
00:55:16,316 --> 00:55:18,360
SAMIR: I can't believe
they had security escort us out.

1209
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:20,612
It's not like
we're going to steal something.

1210
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:24,074
I stole something.

1211
00:55:24,116 --> 00:55:26,159
Oh, yeah. I guess we all did.

1212
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:28,871
PETER:
No, I stole something else.

1213
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:31,373
What did you steal?

1214
00:55:32,958 --> 00:55:35,252
Call it a going-away present.

1215
00:55:51,977 --> 00:55:54,646
GETO BOYS RAPPING: Back up in
your ass with the resurrection

1216
00:55:54,688 --> 00:55:56,106
Is the group
harder than an erection

1217
00:55:56,148 --> 00:55:57,941
That shows no affection

1218
00:55:57,983 --> 00:55:59,776
They want to ban us
on Capitol Hill

1219
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:01,236
'Cause it's die, motherfuckers

1220
00:56:01,278 --> 00:56:03,155
Die, motherfuckers

1221
00:56:03,197 --> 00:56:05,282
Nothing but the ghetto

1222
00:56:05,324 --> 00:56:07,117
Taking drugs, step slow

1223
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:08,619
Kept my head low

1224
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,912
And never let go

1225
00:56:09,953 --> 00:56:11,788
'Cause if I let go,
then I'd be spineless

1226
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:13,707
I'm going insane

1227
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:15,083
My mind, yes,
goes out of control

1228
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:16,919
On some subjects
motherfuckers read on

1229
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,671
I done the shit
that they believe in

1230
00:56:19,713 --> 00:56:21,465
I see this motherfucker's
nine smokin'

1231
00:56:21,507 --> 00:56:22,633
I seen this

1232
00:56:22,674 --> 00:56:24,343
I bet you motherfuckers
will, too

1233
00:56:24,384 --> 00:56:26,011
Because it's die, motherfucker

1234
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:27,554
Die, motherfucker

1235
00:56:27,596 --> 00:56:29,473
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1236
00:56:29,515 --> 00:56:32,476
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1237
00:56:32,518 --> 00:56:35,938
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1238
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:38,440
Die, motherfuckers,
die, motherfuckers

1239
00:56:38,482 --> 00:56:41,485
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1240
00:56:41,527 --> 00:56:44,238
Die, motherfuckers,
die, motherfuckers

1241
00:56:44,279 --> 00:56:46,615
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1242
00:56:46,657 --> 00:56:48,242
I think it's something
in the water

1243
00:56:48,283 --> 00:56:50,619
I think it's something
in the water

1244
00:56:50,661 --> 00:56:52,579
So good to be free again

1245
00:56:52,621 --> 00:56:54,248
With unity for men

1246
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:56,917
I walk around town
with a frown on my face

1247
00:56:56,959 --> 00:56:59,253
The whole world
gonna catch a murder case

1248
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:01,588
The murder rate may decrease

1249
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:03,590
If you're caught up
in the world while it's dying

1250
00:57:03,632 --> 00:57:05,968
I guarantee you'll fry,
'cause I am

1251
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:08,345
On the verge of knocking
motherfuckers out

1252
00:57:08,387 --> 00:57:09,346
For no reason

1253
00:57:09,388 --> 00:57:12,432
Once I get down,
there'll be no breathin'

1254
00:57:12,474 --> 00:57:13,976
MICHAEL: Who's got my keys?

1255
00:57:14,017 --> 00:57:15,435
SAMIR: I'm driving.

1256
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:17,187
PETER:
Everything is gonna be OK.

1257
00:57:17,229 --> 00:57:19,106
All right? OK?

1258
00:57:19,147 --> 00:57:20,774
It's fun, and it's exciting.

1259
00:57:20,816 --> 00:57:23,402
I gotta--I gotta go. All right?

1260
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:24,653
Joanna's coming over.

1261
00:57:24,695 --> 00:57:27,906
Don't worry.
You're worrying. All right?

1262
00:57:27,948 --> 00:57:30,117
Monday morning, we're gonna
check the account balance.

1263
00:57:30,158 --> 00:57:31,285
Everything will be OK.

1264
00:57:31,326 --> 00:57:33,495
Don't miss Tom's barbecue.
I'll see you there.

1265
00:57:33,537 --> 00:57:35,289
All right? Good night!

1266
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:38,000
[Rapping] Back up in your ass
with the resurrection

1267
00:57:40,586 --> 00:57:42,754
What were you guys
celebrating last night?

1268
00:57:42,796 --> 00:57:47,551
Oh, um...l'm not really
at liberty to talk about it.

1269
00:57:50,762 --> 00:57:52,389
I really can't.

1270
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,187
So, when the subroutine
compounds the interest...

1271
00:57:58,228 --> 00:58:00,397
it uses all these
extra decimal places...

1272
00:58:00,439 --> 00:58:02,357
that just get rounded off.

1273
00:58:02,399 --> 00:58:03,984
So we simplified
the whole thing...

1274
00:58:04,026 --> 00:58:07,321
and we round 'em all down
and drop the remainder...

1275
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:09,364
into an account that we opened.

1276
00:58:10,532 --> 00:58:11,909
So you're stealing?

1277
00:58:12,993 --> 00:58:14,828
Uh, no.
No, you don't understand.

1278
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:18,665
It's, uh, very complicated.
It's, uh...

1279
00:58:18,707 --> 00:58:21,793
It's aggregate, so I'm talking
about fractions of a penny...

1280
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:25,172
and, uh, over time,
they add up to a lot.

1281
00:58:25,214 --> 00:58:29,009
Oh, OK. So you're gonna make
a lot of money, right?

1282
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:30,344
-Yeah.
-Right.

1283
00:58:30,385 --> 00:58:31,512
It's not yours?

1284
00:58:31,553 --> 00:58:33,805
Uh...well, it becomes ours.

1285
00:58:33,847 --> 00:58:35,641
How is that not stealing?

1286
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:41,563
I don't think
I'm explaining this very well.

1287
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:44,733
Um, the 7-Eleven, right?

1288
00:58:44,775 --> 00:58:47,069
You'd take a penny
from the tray.

1289
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:48,403
From the crippled children?

1290
00:58:48,445 --> 00:58:49,655
No, that's the jar.

1291
00:58:49,696 --> 00:58:53,200
I'm talking about the tray--
the pennies for everybody.

1292
00:58:53,242 --> 00:58:54,660
Oh, for everybody. OK.

1293
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:56,787
Yeah.
Well, those are whole pennies.

1294
00:58:56,828 --> 00:59:00,707
I'm just talking about
fractions of a penny, OK?

1295
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:02,584
But we do it
from a much bigger tray...

1296
00:59:02,626 --> 00:59:04,711
and we do it
a couple of million times.

1297
00:59:04,753 --> 00:59:06,296
So what's wrong with that?

1298
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:08,006
I don't know.
It just seems wrong.

1299
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:09,216
PETER: It's not wrong.

1300
00:59:09,258 --> 00:59:10,509
Initech is wrong.

1301
00:59:10,551 --> 00:59:13,095
Initech is an evil corporation,
all right?

1302
00:59:13,136 --> 00:59:15,222
Chotchkie's is wrong.

1303
00:59:15,264 --> 00:59:17,224
Doesn't it bother you that you
have to get up in the morning...

1304
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:19,351
and you have to put on
a bunch of pieces of flair?

1305
00:59:19,393 --> 00:59:21,812
Yeah, but I'm not about
to go in and start...

1306
00:59:21,854 --> 00:59:23,522
taking money from the register.

1307
00:59:23,564 --> 00:59:24,815
Well, maybe you should.

1308
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:29,903
The Nazis had pieces of flair
that they made the Jews wear.

1309
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:31,238
What?

1310
00:59:32,906 --> 00:59:34,616
Look, we don't...l'm--

1311
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:36,326
We don't have
to talk about this now.

1312
00:59:36,368 --> 00:59:39,872
Let's just go to the barbecue,
all right?

1313
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:45,627
TOM: Michael, Samir,
how you doin'?

1314
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:46,837
-Hey, Tom.
-Hello, Tom.

1315
00:59:46,879 --> 00:59:50,007
I'd like you to meet
my lawyer Rob Newhouse.

1316
00:59:50,048 --> 00:59:52,801
Rob, Michael. Samir.

1317
00:59:52,843 --> 00:59:56,305
Peter! How are you?
I'm glad you could make it.

1318
00:59:56,388 --> 00:59:59,391
PETER: Tom, hi. This is somebody
I'd like you to meet.

1319
00:59:59,433 --> 01:00:01,351
-This is, uh, Joanna.
-Hi.

1320
01:00:01,393 --> 01:00:03,770
Hi. Forgive me
for not getting up.

1322

[Coughing]
Ooh, ooh.

1323
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:15,782
Peter, come here a minute.
I wanna show you something.

1324
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:19,828
Well...what do you think?
It's a prototype.

1325
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:21,663
PETER: Huh...that's...

1326
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:24,249
that's exactly as you
described it.

1327
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:28,879
Uh, listen, I heard about
your--your settlement.

1328
01:00:28,921 --> 01:00:30,130
Congratulations.

1329
01:00:30,172 --> 01:00:31,340
Well, thanks, Peter.

1330
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:35,302
You know, I'm glad you're here,
because I wanted to talk to you.

1331
01:00:35,344 --> 01:00:38,722
I know how you get depressed
about your job and all, and...

1332
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:41,433
I just wanted you to know
that I know how you feel.

1333
01:00:41,475 --> 01:00:43,227
I used to be the same way.

1334
01:00:43,268 --> 01:00:45,270
-Really?
-Sure.

1335
01:00:45,312 --> 01:00:47,022
Maybe I didn't whine as much.

1336
01:00:47,064 --> 01:00:49,942
But I bet I hated my job
even more than you...

1337
01:00:49,942 --> 01:00:52,277
and I'd been doing it
for over thirty years.

1338
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:53,695
Wow.

1339
01:00:53,737 --> 01:00:57,324
Just remember, if you
hang in there long enough...

1340
01:00:57,366 --> 01:01:00,577
good things can happen
in this world.

1341
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:02,704
I mean, look at me.

1342
01:01:03,705 --> 01:01:05,123
Thanks, Tom.

1343
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:08,085
TOM: Ah, sure.

1344
01:01:08,126 --> 01:01:09,586
[Music playing]

1345
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:16,718
ROB: Conjugal visits?
Not that I know of.

1346
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,429
Minimum-security prison
is no picnic.

1347
01:01:19,471 --> 01:01:21,640
I have a client in there
right now.

1348
01:01:21,682 --> 01:01:23,350
He says the trick is...

1349
01:01:23,392 --> 01:01:25,310
kick someone's ass
the first day...

1350
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:26,812
or become someone's bitch.

1351
01:01:26,854 --> 01:01:29,481
Then everything
will be all right.

1352
01:01:29,523 --> 01:01:31,191
Why do you ask, anyway?

1353
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:33,527
MICHAEL: Oh, no, we just--

1354
01:01:33,569 --> 01:01:34,778
SAMIR: It's a...

1355
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:43,120
-Hey, Peter.
-Drew.

1356
01:01:43,161 --> 01:01:45,372
That's something
about old Smykowski, huh?

1357
01:01:45,414 --> 01:01:47,207
-Yeah.
-Lucky bastard.

1358
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:51,628
DREW: Hey, isn't that the girl
that works over at Chotchkie's?

1359
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:53,463
PETER: Yep.

1360
01:01:53,505 --> 01:01:55,132
Who's she here with?

1361
01:01:55,174 --> 01:01:56,466
She's with me.

1362
01:01:58,302 --> 01:02:00,429
-Really?
-Yep.

1363
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:03,891
All right, Peter.
Ooh, ooh, right on.

1364
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:07,060
Make sure you wear a rubber,
dude.

1365
01:02:09,354 --> 01:02:10,522
Why's that, Drew?

1366
01:02:10,564 --> 01:02:12,274
Are you kidding me?

1367
01:02:12,316 --> 01:02:14,359
She gets around. All right?

1368
01:02:15,861 --> 01:02:17,905
She does, does she?

1369
01:02:17,946 --> 01:02:20,073
Oh, yeah, like a record.

1370
01:02:22,993 --> 01:02:24,453
PETER: Like with who?

1371
01:02:24,494 --> 01:02:27,456
Oh, let's see, uh...

1372
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:29,625
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

1373
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:32,461
Uh, let me see, who else?

1374
01:02:34,588 --> 01:02:35,756
Lumbergh?

1375
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:40,552
JOANNA: What if you get caught?

1376
01:02:40,552 --> 01:02:43,847
Oh, I just don't know
if this was such a good idea.

1377
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:46,975
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
for you to sleep with Lumbergh.

1378
01:02:47,017 --> 01:02:48,352
What?

1379
01:02:48,393 --> 01:02:49,603
What are you--

1380
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:52,814
Oh, right, Lumbergh.

1381
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:54,316
Aah!

1382
01:02:54,399 --> 01:02:57,528
Oh...God...Lumbergh!

1383
01:02:57,569 --> 01:02:59,571
Peter, what is wrong with you?

1384
01:02:59,613 --> 01:03:01,365
That was, like, two years ago.

1385
01:03:01,406 --> 01:03:02,824
What? Did you know him?

1386
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:04,493
Yeah, I know him. I know him.

1387
01:03:04,535 --> 01:03:05,869
He's my boss.

1388
01:03:05,911 --> 01:03:09,373
He's my unholy,
disgusting pig of a boss.

1389
01:03:09,373 --> 01:03:11,500
Oh, he's not that disgusting.

1390
01:03:11,542 --> 01:03:14,837
PETER: He represents all
that is soulless and wrong...

1391
01:03:14,878 --> 01:03:16,630
and you slept with him.

1392
01:03:16,672 --> 01:03:20,092
Hey, that is none
of your business, OK?

1393
01:03:20,133 --> 01:03:23,011
I didn't ask you who you slept
with before we were together.

1394
01:03:23,053 --> 01:03:24,263
I don't care.

1395
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:26,390
I didn't think you
slept with guys like Lumbergh!

1396
01:03:26,431 --> 01:03:28,684
Listen to you.

1397
01:03:28,725 --> 01:03:30,185
Who do you think you are?

1398
01:03:30,269 --> 01:03:32,813
How dare you judge me?

1399
01:03:32,855 --> 01:03:35,691
I mean, what are you?
You think you're an angel?

1400
01:03:35,732 --> 01:03:38,485
No, you're just
this penny-stealing...

1401
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:41,238
wannabe criminal man.

1402
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,990
Yeah, well, that may be.

1403
01:03:43,031 --> 01:03:45,534
But at least I never
slept with Lumbergh.

1404
01:03:45,576 --> 01:03:46,869
OK, that's...l'm done.

1405
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:50,163
I wanna get out of the car, OK?
Stop.

1406
01:03:50,205 --> 01:03:52,082
Call me when you grow up.

1407
01:03:52,124 --> 01:03:54,293
Wait. That's probably
never gonna happen.

1408
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:55,586
So don't call me, OK?

1409
01:03:55,627 --> 01:03:57,838
Say hello to Lumbergh for me!

1410
01:04:04,678 --> 01:04:06,513
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

1411
01:04:06,555 --> 01:04:08,140
Lumbergh fucked her.

1412
01:04:08,182 --> 01:04:10,392
Lumbergh fucked her.

1413
01:04:10,434 --> 01:04:12,394
That is great.

1414
01:04:12,436 --> 01:04:15,522
I mean, she was seeing
the "Oh" face for sure.

1415
01:04:15,564 --> 01:04:19,359
Ohh, ohh, ohh.

1416
01:04:19,401 --> 01:04:21,028
Ooh.

1417
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:23,739
If you could just move
a little bit to the left.

1418
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:26,241
That's it. Great.

1419
01:04:26,241 --> 01:04:28,410
Peter, what's happening?

1420
01:04:28,452 --> 01:04:33,373
Um, could you give me
those T.P.S. reports ASAP, OK?

1421
01:04:33,373 --> 01:04:34,583
Oh!

1422
01:04:48,805 --> 01:04:50,390
-Joanna.
-Yeah.

1423
01:04:50,974 --> 01:04:52,809
We need to talk.

1424
01:04:52,851 --> 01:04:54,770
Do you know what this is about?

1425
01:04:58,649 --> 01:05:00,275
My, uh, flair?

1426
01:05:00,317 --> 01:05:02,486
Yeah.

1427
01:05:02,528 --> 01:05:06,365
Or your lack of flair,
because, uh...

1428
01:05:06,406 --> 01:05:08,825
I'm counting,
and I only see fifteen pieces.

1429
01:05:08,867 --> 01:05:11,203
Let me ask you a question,
Joanna.

1430
01:05:11,245 --> 01:05:15,332
What do you think of a person
who only does the bare minimum?

1431
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:19,628
Huh, what do I think?
Um, you know what, Stan...

1432
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:23,966
if you want me to wear
thirty-seven pieces of flair...

1433
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:26,385
Iike your, uh, pretty boy
over there, Brian...

1434
01:05:26,426 --> 01:05:28,053
why don't you just
make the minimum...

1435
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:30,097
thirty-seven pieces of flair?

1436
01:05:30,138 --> 01:05:32,766
Well, I thought
I remembered you saying...

1437
01:05:32,808 --> 01:05:35,060
that you wanted
to express yourself.

1438
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:37,104
JOANNA: Yeah.
You know what? Yeah, I do.

1439
01:05:37,145 --> 01:05:39,606
I do want to express myself.

1440
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:42,484
And I don't need thirty-seven
pieces of flair to do it.

1441
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:46,697
All right? There's my flair. OK?

1442
01:05:46,738 --> 01:05:51,076
And this is me
expressing myself. OK?

1443
01:05:51,118 --> 01:05:52,828
There it is.

1444
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:54,454
I hate this job.

1445
01:05:54,496 --> 01:05:57,165
I hate this goddamn job,
and I don't need it.

1446
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:14,099
Oh, shit.

1447
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:15,767
-Shit.
-Shit.

1448
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:18,353
-Shit.
-Son of a bitch.

1449
01:06:18,395 --> 01:06:21,148
-Shit.
-This is a fuck.

1450
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:22,316
SAMIR: l--I...Shit.

1451
01:06:22,357 --> 01:06:23,817
MICHAEL: What happened?

1452
01:06:23,901 --> 01:06:26,069
PETER: You tell me, Michael!
It's your software!

1453
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:27,696
SAMIR: Yes, it's your software.

1454
01:06:27,738 --> 01:06:29,948
PETER: Corporate accounting
is sure as hell gonna notice...

1455
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:32,701
three hundred five thousand,
three hundred....

1456
01:06:32,743 --> 01:06:36,038
twenty-six thirteen, Michael!

1457
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,414
SAMIR: Oh, shit.

1458
01:06:37,456 --> 01:06:39,499
MICHAEL: They probably
won't know it's gone...

1459
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:41,335
for another three or four days.

1460
01:06:41,376 --> 01:06:44,963
Michael! You said this thing
was gonna take two years.

1461
01:06:45,005 --> 01:06:47,508
What happened? You said
the thing was supposed to work!

1462
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:48,842
MICHAEL:
Technically, it did work.

1463
01:06:48,884 --> 01:06:50,219
No, it didn't!

1464
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:53,222
SAMIR:
It did not work, Michael, OK?

1465
01:06:53,263 --> 01:06:54,848
MICHAEL: OK.

1466
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:58,060
I must have put a decimal point
in the wrong place or something.

1467
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:00,646
I always do that. I always
mess up some mundane detail.

1468
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:04,733
Oh! Well, this is not
a mundane detail, Michael!

1469
01:07:04,775 --> 01:07:06,360
MICHAEL:
Quit getting pissed at me.

1470
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:08,278
This was all your idea, asshole.

1471
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:11,573
All right. OK.

1472
01:07:11,573 --> 01:07:14,117
Let's try not to get
pissed off at each other.

1473
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:16,703
Let's calm down, try to figure
this thing out together.

1474
01:07:16,745 --> 01:07:20,499
We gotta close that account
before it gets bigger.

1475
01:07:20,541 --> 01:07:24,753
WORKERS SINGING:
Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday, Mr. Lumbergh

BILL: Looks terrific.

1480
01:07:45,399 --> 01:07:46,567
Mmm.

1481
01:07:46,608 --> 01:07:49,278
Here, Peg, you wanna
get everybody started?

1482
01:07:52,573 --> 01:07:53,782
Mmm.

1483
01:07:53,782 --> 01:07:55,242
Oh, that is terrific.

1484
01:07:55,284 --> 01:07:56,618
Just terrific.

1485
01:07:56,660 --> 01:08:00,414
Thanks, everybody.
I really, really appreciate it.

1486
01:08:00,455 --> 01:08:01,832
It's very special.

1487
01:08:01,832 --> 01:08:04,126
NINA:
Now, Milton, don't be greedy.

1488
01:08:04,168 --> 01:08:07,462
Let's pass it along and make
sure everyone gets a piece.

1489
01:08:07,504 --> 01:08:10,632
MILTON: But last time I didn't
receive a piece and I was told--

1490
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:12,217
Just pass.

1491
01:08:12,259 --> 01:08:17,472
OK, here. But this...

1492
01:08:19,057 --> 01:08:22,561
The cake...
There's lots of cake?

1493
01:08:23,604 --> 01:08:26,607
The ratio of people to cake
is too big.

1494
01:08:43,832 --> 01:08:46,668
[Mumbles] I could set
the building on fire.

1495
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:50,839
Is there some way
to just give the money back?

1496
01:08:50,881 --> 01:08:53,717
Hand them a check for the exact
amount they're missing?

1497
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,720
I--I think
they'd figure that out.

1498
01:08:56,762 --> 01:08:58,972
Well, we have to do something.

1499
01:08:59,014 --> 01:09:01,016
Maybe we could launder
the money.

1500
01:09:02,392 --> 01:09:04,353
That's a great idea.

1501
01:09:04,394 --> 01:09:05,521
OK, how do we do that?

1502
01:09:05,562 --> 01:09:07,272
I don't know.

1503
01:09:07,314 --> 01:09:09,024
I don't even know what it means.
I was hoping you knew.

1504
01:09:09,066 --> 01:09:10,859
I think coke dealers do it.

1505
01:09:10,901 --> 01:09:13,445
OK, all right.
Do we know any coke dealers?

1506
01:09:14,363 --> 01:09:15,822
My cousin's a cokehead.

1507
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:22,913
Fuck.

1508
01:09:22,955 --> 01:09:24,248
We're in deep shit.

Yes, we are in very,
very deep shit.

-Milton.
-Yes.

1511
01:09:35,008 --> 01:09:36,218
BILL: What's happening?

1512
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,804
Say, Milton,
you know what'd be great?

1513
01:09:38,846 --> 01:09:39,972
MILTON: But...no.

1514
01:09:40,013 --> 01:09:41,849
BILL: Since you're down here...

1515
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:45,102
it would be really great
if you could just sort of...

1516
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:47,938
take care of the cockroach
problem we've had in here.

1517
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:51,024
That's really not my job, and I
haven't received my paycheck...

1518
01:09:51,066 --> 01:09:52,943
For now,
why don't you go ahead...

1519
01:09:52,943 --> 01:09:56,363
and get yourself a flashlight
and a can of pesticide...

1520
01:09:56,405 --> 01:09:57,573
and crawl down--

DOM: Bill?
We need you upstairs right away.

1522
01:10:00,117 --> 01:10:01,994
We got a big problem--big.

1523
01:10:02,035 --> 01:10:04,955
Some major glitch in accounting,
a lot of money missing.

the last straw.

help us, Michael.

what a bunch of nerds we are.

01:10:41,033 --> 01:10:43,202
We're looking up money
laundering in a dictionary.

Yeah, well, you guys
can both eat my ass, OK?

-Yeah, you didn't know that?

MICHAEL: A couple of years ago,
before he moved to Atlanta.

1541
01:10:58,467 --> 01:11:02,304
You mean Ron Lumbergh,
the lnitrode guy? The young guy?

Yeah.

Good evening, sir.
My name is Steve.

magazine subscriptions...

1573
01:12:22,968 --> 01:12:24,469
than I ever did at lnitrode.

1574

Heh. At lnitrode?

I mean, we know a lot of
the same people. That's...

1578
01:12:35,272 --> 01:12:37,900
Actually, um,
that all depends.

1579

What am I gonna do with
forty subscriptions to "Vibe"?

We never should have done this.

1581
01:12:48,327 --> 01:12:50,162
What were we thinking?

1582
01:12:51,121 --> 01:12:52,206
You know what I can't
figure out?

1583
01:12:52,289 --> 01:12:55,501
How is it that all these stupid
Neanderthal Mafia guys...

1584
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:56,960
can be so good at crime...

and smart guys like us
can suck so badly at it?

SAMIR: We're new to it, though.

1587

If we had more experience...

1588
01:13:03,759 --> 01:13:07,179
No. You know what I think?
I think we're screwed.

1589
01:13:07,221 --> 01:13:08,722

there's enough evidence...

all over that building
to link us to this.

1591

Even if we could launder money,
I wouldn't want to.

1592
01:13:13,018 --> 01:13:14,645
What we've done is bad enough.

1593
01:13:14,686 --> 01:13:15,979
We get caught
laundering money...

1594
01:13:16,021 --> 01:13:18,065
we're not going
to white-collar resort prison.

to any prison.

Why the hell did I do this?

1598
01:13:25,572 --> 01:13:28,283
I've never done anything wrong
in my whole life.

1599
01:13:28,283 --> 01:13:29,576
We weren't thinking clearly...

1600
01:13:29,618 --> 01:13:31,787
because you told us
we were losing our jobs.

1601
01:13:31,828 --> 01:13:34,248
Now look at us, we're worried
about going in a prison.

1602
01:13:34,289 --> 01:13:36,542
Don't worry about it.
I'll think of something.

Actually, a line cook...

01:23:10,407 --> 01:23:13,076
I asked for a mai tai,
and they brought a pia colada.

1729
01:23:13,118 --> 01:23:15,495
And I said no salt, no salt...

1730
01:23:15,495 --> 01:23:17,247
for the margarita,
but it had salt on it.

1731
01:23:17,289 --> 01:23:19,917
Lo siento mucho, seor.
Pinche gringo.

1732
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:23,629
I won't be leaving a tip,
'cause I could...

1733
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:25,506
I could shut
this whole resort down.

1734
01:23:25,547 --> 01:23:27,132
Sir?

1735
01:23:27,174 --> 01:23:31,637
I'll take my traveler's checks
to a competing resort.

1736
01:23:33,555 --> 01:23:36,141
I could write a letter
to your board of tourism.

1737
01:23:36,183 --> 01:23:38,435
I could have this place
condemned.

1738
01:23:38,477 --> 01:23:43,315
I could put, I could put
strychnine in the guacamole.

1739
01:23:43,357 --> 01:23:45,150
There was salt on the glass,
big grains of salt.

1740
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:45,817
There was salt on the glass,
big grains of salt.

1741
01:24:00,749 --> 01:24:02,751
DREW: Give a ride
on the old bone roller coaster.

1742
01:24:02,793 --> 01:24:04,795
Aaaah!

1743
01:24:05,838 --> 01:24:07,256
CANIBUS RAPPING:
Yeah

1744
01:24:07,297 --> 01:24:10,676
Yo, 6:00 every morning,
you're waking up yawnin'

1745
01:24:10,717 --> 01:24:12,803
To the sound
of your alarm clock alarmin'

1746
01:24:12,803 --> 01:24:14,137
About an hour from now

1747
01:24:14,137 --> 01:24:16,265
You should be
at your place of employment

1748
01:24:16,306 --> 01:24:18,183
Which is annoyin'
'cause it's so borin'

1749
01:24:18,225 --> 01:24:19,393
You coworkers are talking

1750
01:24:19,434 --> 01:24:21,103
LAWRENCE: Don't come back
in a dress, man.

1751
01:24:21,144 --> 01:24:23,355
Ha ha ha. You big fag.

1752
01:24:23,397 --> 01:24:25,816
CANIBUS RAPPING: You wonder
why your workload is so enormous

1753
01:24:25,816 --> 01:24:29,111
'Cause your boss just laid
off 3/4 of the whole office

1754
01:24:29,152 --> 01:24:31,321
People get depressed,
they get ulcers

1755
01:24:31,363 --> 01:24:34,032
From the stress that
the corporate environment causes

1756
01:24:34,074 --> 01:24:36,785
Regardless of how
you ultimately wanna solve this

1757
01:24:36,827 --> 01:24:39,371
Seems to me like you've
got one of four choices

1758
01:24:39,413 --> 01:24:41,832
You can take a new job offer
for more chips

1759
01:24:41,874 --> 01:24:44,543
Stick it out a little longer
or forfeit

1760
01:24:44,585 --> 01:24:46,086
But my advice to anybody--

1761
01:24:46,128 --> 01:24:47,379
JOANNA: I'm working
at Hooters now, you know...

1762
01:24:47,421 --> 01:24:49,464
and it's very cool.

1763
01:24:49,506 --> 01:24:52,134
BIZ MARKIE SINGING:
Take this job and shove it

1764
01:24:52,176 --> 01:24:55,137
I ain't working here no more

1765
01:24:55,179 --> 01:24:57,347
Take this job and shove it

1766
01:24:57,389 --> 01:25:00,475
I ain't working here no more

1767
01:25:00,517 --> 01:25:02,644
Take this job and shove it

1768
01:25:02,686 --> 01:25:05,564
CANIBUS RAPPING: Just shove it,
take this job and shove it

1769
01:25:05,606 --> 01:25:08,358
BIZ MARKIE SINGING:
Take this job, take this job

1770
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,360
take this job and shove it,
shove it

1771
01:25:10,402 --> 01:25:12,571
CANIBUS RAPPING:
Yo, if your boss is a S.O.B.

1772
01:25:12,613 --> 01:25:15,699
Tell him to s-h-o-v-e the j-o-b

1773
01:25:15,741 --> 01:25:18,118
Put your middle finger
up slowly

1774
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:21,496
Put it close enough to his face
so he can examine it closely

1775
01:25:21,538 --> 01:25:23,290
Say "l ain't working here
no more

1776
01:25:23,332 --> 01:25:24,583
"Who do you think you are?"

1777
01:25:24,625 --> 01:25:26,335
Whip the apron off,
throw it on the floor

1778
01:25:26,376 --> 01:25:29,713
Run to the door, to the pay
phone, make a toll-free call

1779
01:25:29,755 --> 01:25:31,882
Tell your stocks what happened
and where you are

1780
01:25:31,882 --> 01:25:34,343
So they can come
and get you in the car later on

1781
01:25:34,384 --> 01:25:37,012
And help you search
for a new nine-to-five job

1782
01:25:37,054 --> 01:25:39,473
If the unemployment line
ain't that long

1783
01:25:39,515 --> 01:25:42,226
You can take your time
filling out W-9 forms

1784
01:25:42,267 --> 01:25:45,187
Eventually, you'll get on
if you try hard enough

1785
01:25:45,229 --> 01:25:47,856
And you get money if you keep
punching your time card enough

1786
01:25:47,898 --> 01:25:49,525
Maybe you hate it,
maybe you love it

1787
01:25:49,566 --> 01:25:51,485
But if you hate it,
all you gotta do

1788
01:25:51,527 --> 01:25:53,070
Is get mad
and tell your boss to

1789
01:25:53,111 --> 01:25:55,030
BIZ MARKIE SINGING:
Take this job and shove it

1790
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:58,408
I ain't working here no more

1791
01:25:58,450 --> 01:26:00,327
Take this job and shove it

1792
01:26:00,369 --> 01:26:03,580
I ain't working here no more

1793
01:26:03,622 --> 01:26:05,916
Take this job and shove it

1794

I ain't working here no more

1795
01:26:08,877 --> 01:26:13,632
Take this job, take this job,
take this job and shove it

1796
01:26:13,674 --> 01:26:16,301
CANIBUS RAPPING: Yo, so mind
your patience or like slave gigs

1797
01:26:16,343 --> 01:26:18,804
The boss' favorite to get
placed in something spacious

1798
01:26:18,846 --> 01:26:20,389
While the most hated get placed

1799
01:26:20,472 --> 01:26:22,057
In some small cubicle spaces

1800
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:23,725
Or get thrown down
in the basement

1801
01:26:23,767 --> 01:26:26,520
Get your stapler confiscated,
you constantly waitin'

1802
01:26:26,562 --> 01:26:28,772
For a paycheck,
twelve months pass by

1803
01:26:28,814 --> 01:26:30,107
And you still ain't get paid yet

1804
01:26:30,148 --> 01:26:31,650
Here's an optimistic motto

1805
01:26:31,692 --> 01:26:33,360
If you ever late for today

1806
01:26:33,402 --> 01:26:35,279
You can stay early for tomorrow

1807
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,989
Most nine-to-fives are hard

1808
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:38,448
'Cause the description
of the job

1809
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:40,242
Ain't no picnic in the park

1810
01:26:40,284 --> 01:26:43,120
People get hired,
drink coffee to stay wired

1811
01:26:43,161 --> 01:26:45,664
So they don't get tired,
sleep late, and get fired

1812
01:26:45,706 --> 01:26:48,125
BIZ MARKIE RAPPING: You came in
late, you already ate

1813
01:26:48,166 --> 01:26:50,752
Now, you want
to take a lunch break?

1814
01:26:50,794 --> 01:26:53,547
CANIBUS RAPPING: Yo, bust it,
ain't no need to discuss it

1815
01:26:53,589 --> 01:26:56,550
Just take this job and shove it
right between your buttocks

I ain't working here no more

Ay-ya ya-ya-ya,

CANIBUS RAPPING: Just shove it

BIZ MARKIE SINGING:
Canibus and the Biz

1833

Ah-aah aah-ah

It's coming from
Canibus and the Biz

1835

It's coming from
Canibus and the Biz

1836
01:27:55,317 --> 01:28:06,745
From, from Canibus
