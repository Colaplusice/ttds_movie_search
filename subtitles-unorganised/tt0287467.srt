1
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,120
TALK TO HER

2
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,360
The stage is full of wooden
chairs and tables.

3
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,760
Two women come out with robes.

4
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,720
Their eyes are closed.
Like two sleepwalkers.

5
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,280
You get scared...They trip
on everything, poor them.

6
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,120
But suddenly, a man appears.

7
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,040
With a very sad face, the
saddest I have ever seen.

8
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,160
He pushes tables and chairs
out of their way.

9
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,080
You can't imagine how touching
it was.

10
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,120
Someone was sitting next to me.
In his 40s, hundsome.

11
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,520
He cried with emotion,
lots of times.

12
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,680
I don't understand why...
It was very beautiful!

13
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,360
I have a surprise for you!

14
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,520
I have an autograph of
Rina Baus for you.

15
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,280
I had to buy the photo.

16
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,000
It is in english and says:

17
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,360
I hope you surpass all
the obstacles...

18
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,160
... and start dancing.

19
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,600
-She has her period.
-It's early.

20
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,680
Good evening.

21
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,240
Benigno, can you
stay tonight?

22
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,840
My sister can't,
and I don't have anyone else.

23
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,920
Why did you come?
You should have called.

24
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,520
I am not taking advantage of you.
This week you did 3 nights.

25
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,640
Don't worry. A free afternoon
is enough for me.

26
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,440
I have to see the house
workers. It's a mess.

27
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,800
And to frame a photo.

28
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,080
My condition is not improving.
The hospital will decide.

29
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,560
Your husband left you
and the children.

30
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,440
Just come the nights you can.
We will be ok.

31
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,120
Thanks a lot.

32
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,680
-You cut off the intestinal food.
-She couldn't take it.

33
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,080
-We will try again tomorrow.
-Yes, go now.

34
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,280
And keep the spirits up!

35
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,000
Six bulls and a woman.
Wednesday at Briuega.

36
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,800
Lydia P Gonzales will
fight six bulls.

37
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,280
Why such a drastic decision?

38
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,920
It's my job. 2 bulls, or 6.
Whatever they say.

39
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,560
People say a lot of bullfighters
won't fight with you...

40
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,480
...because you are a woman.

41
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,120
People can say what they want.

42
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,840
Too much chauvinism in bullfighting,
but there are exceptions.

43
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,000
Nino Valencia was happy to share
billing with you for several months.

44
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,920
Do you think he did it
to promote himself?

45
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,520
And when he succeeded that,
he abandoned you?

46
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,720
I told you, I don't want
to talk about this!

47
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,280
But by talking about
certain problems...

48
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,800
...is the first step
towards their solution.

49
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,400
-Nino Valencia...
-Enough!

50
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,720
My dear Lydia, let me
finish the question.

51
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,960
I am not discussing this.
I told you earlier.

52
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,320
You didn't say anything earlier!
It's bad what you are saying!

53
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,400
They will think
it's a fixed interview.

54
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,200
And I am on of the few who
dare say the truth...

55
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,360
...and you should dare accept

56
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,560
...that Nino Valencia
took advantage of you.

57
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,440
He shared with you not only
the fame, but sex as well.

58
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,880
And he left you when
time was right.

59
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,280
Juan Luis, Marco here...
How are you?

60
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,040
I want to ask you something.

61
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,160
I would like to do an article
about Lydia Gonzales.

62
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,280
Yes, I see it too...

63
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,680
I would like to do something
deep.

64
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,760
For the Sunday issue?
Great...

65
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,600
-The woman has gone crazy!
-She dedicates it to you.

66
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,680
She would let the bull injur
her, just so that you see it.

67
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,200
You shouldn't have come,
especially you.

68
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,120
Don't tell me anything.
I know what I am doing.

69
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,480
Nino should concentrate.
He doesn't want any more worries.

70
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,720
Nothing to worry about. He should
just come to pick up his stuff.

71
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,920
-Or tell me where to send them.
-Send them at my place.

72
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,880
He, himself, should say so.
This is nothing to do with you.

73
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,720
You can leave whenever you want.

74
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,800
-Good evening.
-Scotch on the rocks, please.

75
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,040
-What glass do you prefer?
-A tall one.

76
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,640
Can I talk to you for
a minute, please?

77
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,480
Forget it. When something is
over, it's over.

78
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,640
-What are you saying?
-Can I talk to you?

79
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,920
If you take me to Madrid,
we can talk on the way.

80
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,040
It will be my pleasure.

81
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,960
-Who named you Lydia;
-My father.

82
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,320
It's as if he sealed your destiny.

83
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,720
He always wanted to be a bullfighter,
but stayed a banderillero.

84
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,120
He is the one that was there
for me, more than anyone else.

85
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,840
But he died last year.

86
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,080
I am sorry.

87
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,080
'El Pais' wants me to do a profile
on you for their Sunday issue.

88
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,720
Do you write on bullfighting?
I don't know your name.

89
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,120
To be honest,
I know nothing of it.

90
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,000
But I know a lot about
desperate women.

91
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,680
And who told you I am
desperate?

92
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,440
-This is the impression I have.
-Bullfighting doesn't interest you.

93
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,480
You are interested in my
relationship with Nino Valencia.

94
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,800
Tell EI Pais to leave me alone!

95
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,160
-Take me from here!
-What's going on?

96
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,880
Take me from here! There is
a snake in the kitchen.

97
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,240
-Give me the keys.
-The door is open.

98
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,720
Calm down.
And stay there.

99
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
My purse.

100
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,160
Take me to a hotel.

101
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,200
I am never coming back to
this house.

102
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,560
-To which hotel?
-To Eurobuilding, lets say.

103
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,360
Don't tell anyone about
the snake, please.

104
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,880
Only my family knows.

105
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,240
I always respect other
people's phobias.

106
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,720
After what you have done, how
can I say no to to the profile?

107
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,440
Think about it again. I will
call tomorrow, tell me then.

108
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,520
Thanks for everything.

109
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,560
Do you want me to stay? I can
sleep in the sofa.

110
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,920
No, I need to get used to
being alone.

111
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,720
Do you wash her?

112
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,880
What do you think?

113
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,200
-How was the night?
-normal.

114
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,160
-Give it to me. I will do it.
-I am going now.

115
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,640
-Good bye.
-Bye, Matilde.

116
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's so hot!

117
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,000
-Lets cut her hair.
-short, it's more practical.

118
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,960
We will leave it as it was
when she came here...

119
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,120
...so that she is not surprised
when she wakes up.

120
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,120
After 4 years, it will be great.

121
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,680
I believe in miracles.
So should you.

122
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,680
-Why me?
-Because you need them.

123
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,960
One might happen to you,
and you will not know.

124
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,720
So hot!

125
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,040
I took something from the
drugstore...

126
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,040
...to help stop the perspiration
stains on my uniform.

127
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,880
My armpits are ok,
but look at my face.

128
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,240
-What's it called?
-Perspirex.

129
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,120
It's Marco...
Remember me?

130
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,320
-How are you?
-Naked.

131
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,440
I need to buy some clothes.
That's all I've got.

132
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,400
I can bring you some
from your place.

133
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,840
I don't want anything from there.
Maybe another time.

134
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,280
-Where are we going?
-To Sybilla.

135
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,960
-You think I am crazy.
-Why?

136
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,720
-Because I don't want to go home.
-No, I understand.

137
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,280
When I separated, I couldn't
sleep in the same bed...

138
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,680
I was sleeping in the sofa,
in the living room.

139
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,080
For a week. Until I finally
bought a new bed.

140
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,600
So, you are separated.

141
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,240
I am alone.

142
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,760
AFTER A FEW MONTHS

143
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,640
Marco, we should
talk afterwards.

144
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,400
-We've been talking for an hour.
-You have, not me.

145
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,320
Indeed.

146
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,280
Did you read about the nuns
that got raped by the misionaries?

147
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,640
Priests, themselves!
It's horrible!

148
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,040
Yeah, they've gone bad too!
Where are we heading to?

149
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,520
First they raped the locals.

150
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,240
Then, due to AIDS, they started
raping nuns.

151
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,800
And I admired them so much!

152
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,800
Not all of them are rapists,
for sure.

153
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,840
No, some of them are
pedophiles.

154
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,840
-What's that? Everyone loves fucking.
-Antonio, you are an animal!

155
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,600
-How do the bulls look?
-Good, but fat.

156
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,160
-How much do you think?
-Over 500 kilos.

157
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,640
I am going to the bar. And don't
forget, we are eating home.

158
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,240
If the kids don't see their aunt,
there'll be hell to pay.

159
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,320
Don't cry, my love.

160
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,720
-How is it?
-Very bad.

161
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,520
It tore her apart.

162
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,120
The father will be happy now!

163
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,320
'Not the little one!', we kept
telling him, my mother and I.

164
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,560
And yet, she became like him.

165
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,800
Don't be upset.

166
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,840
What time is it?

167
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,160
It has been four hours.

168
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,320
AFTER THREE WEEKS

169
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,760
Are you going to Cordoba?

170
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,400
Yes...I would like to stay,
but I can't.

171
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,920
We can't do anything extra.

172
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,440
The bar's been closed for 20 days.

173
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,880
The kids are with the neigbhour,
and I've neglected the other one.

174
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,560
If something happens, can
you be here in 2 hours?

175
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
-Rest assured for that.
-We have to have faith.

176
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,680
I light some candles...

177
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,600
...but I find it very
difficult to have faith.

178
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,400
When can we put her medals
back on her?

179
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,280
Not yet.

180
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,400
With all these...
wounds, the tracheotomy...

181
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,520
She never took them off.

182
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,200
I will get a vase.

183
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,320
I have to go to the US
for three months.

184
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,880
It is very important,
says my agent.

185
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,080
And yet...the way things
stand here...

186
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,320
...I don't want to go.

187
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,000
Can you get out for
a moment, please?

188
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,120
No smoking here.

189
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,840
Did she talk to you that day?

190
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,880
-Or rather, I talked.
-And what did you say?

191
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,280
Things that concern me.

192
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,960
Did she tell you anything
about me?

193
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,920
Honestly, Lydia hadn't talked
about you for a long time.

194
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,120
-It's my fault for what happened.
-No, it's my fault.

195
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,320
Caetano made me
freak out.

196
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,080
Marco, I've always wanted
to ask you something.

197
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,000
Why did you cry that night,
after you killed the snake?

198
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,120
It brought me lots of memories.

199
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,280
Years ago, I had to
kill another snake.

200
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,760
We were in Africa.

201
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,200
She had the same phobia as you.

202
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,240
She was waiting outside the tent,
terrified, defenseless...

203
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,800
...and totally naked...

204
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,720
...because she had seen the snake,
while we were asleep.

205
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,240
Was it the same one who made
you sleep in the living room?

206
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,920
I hate that woman.

207
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,880
-I haven't seen her for years.
-Even worse.

208
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,880
What can I do to make you
forget her?

209
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,440
Exactly what you are doing now.

210
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,760
You were sound asleep. We didn't
want to wake you up.

211
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,240
-Is Dr Vega here?
-He is in his office.

212
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,680
Rosa, close the door.
There's a draft.

213
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,560
-She opened her eyes.
-That gives me the creeps!

214
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,880
-And when she yawns?
-I shit myself!

215
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,840
Good morning, doctor.
I want to talk to you.

216
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,680
How are you? Did you sleep well?

217
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,160
I will buy you coffee.

218
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,040
How long for might Lydia
stay like that?

219
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,000
Months... years...
maybe for the rest of her life...

220
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,320
There is no hope?

221
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,160
As a doctor, I have to say
no... However...

222
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,400
RESUSCITATION

223
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,160
Meryl Moon wakes up after
15 years in a coma.

224
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,600
She went into a coma during
childbirth.

225
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,880
Meryl was a PVS, persistent
vegetative state, like Lydia, for life.

226
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,880
Her recovery contradicts
everything I am about to say.

227
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,800
That is, that there is hope.

228
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,600
I insist. Scientifically, no.

229
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,720
But if you want to have faith,
OK.

230
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,360
Is she opening her eyes?
Or I imagine this?

231
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,760
She does, but that doesn't mean
she is aware of anything.

232
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,160
Her brain cell has been
completely destroyed.

233
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,280
However, it can control
the automatic functions...

234
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,080
such as breathing, sleeping,
waking up and intestinal functions.

235
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,880
She opens her eyes,
but mechanically.

236
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,120
Her brain is dead. She has
no ideas and feelings.

237
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,840
Come in, please.

238
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:03,120
-My name is Benigno.
-Marco Zuloaga

239
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,360
This is Alicia.

240
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,520
Was it your first night here?

241
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,480
The first one is the worst.
Then you get used to it.

242
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,520
Why these boots?

243
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,920
They prevent her feet from
twisting or falling.

244
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,480
-They look like 'Ibiza' boots.
-I've never been to Ibiza.

245
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,120
-I know you.
-From my books?

246
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,680
It was in Cafe Muller...
We happened to be sitting together.

247
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And at some stage,
you started crying.

248
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,480
I told you about him.
He cried watching "Caf?Muller".

249
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,080
I have to go.

250
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,440
That fast?
We barely talked.

251
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,680
-Maybe another time.
-Will you come in the afternoon?

252
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,560
Come to see us. I am always here,
even during the night.

253
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,920
I am a 'veteran' here.
If you need something...

254
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,080
-Should I call Dr Vega;
-Carry on with what you are doing.

255
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,440
The other day, while browsing
my notes...

256
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,160
...I found some
from your visit.

257
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,960
I wrote a topic to be discussed
during the second visit...

258
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,560
...that never took place.

259
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,320
-What about?
-Your sexual orientation.

260
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,520
-My sexual orientation?
-yes, your sexuality.

261
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,800
Whether you like men or women.

262
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,840
During your visit, you said
you were still a virgin.

263
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,000
Answering your question
somehow...

264
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,520
... I think I look for men,
mostly.

265
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,920
-Is this why you came to see me?
-I can't remember now.

266
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,200
I guess that's it...
But I am very well now.

267
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,320
Do you have a partner?

268
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,880
More or less. I am not alone
anymore. I don't have a problem.

269
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,400
I hope you were not offended
by my question.

270
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,120
Was her father here?

271
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,560
He asked me if I am a fag.

272
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,200
He used an american expression,
more subtle.

273
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,320
-What is my orientation?
-And what did you say?

274
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,920
-That I like men.
-Really?

275
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,960
No, you fool. I lied.

276
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,560
How can he dare ask whether
I like men or women?

277
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,800
-What does he care?
-I am glad I found out.

278
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,920
Did he ask the head nurseor you
if you like bestiality or coprophagy?

279
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,880
No, you are right. They don't
ask such things.

280
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,800
I might go on a trip, and I won't
be able to come and see you.

281
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:51,320
But, in Geneva, they've
offered me a creation...

282
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,400
...a chorography
that thrills me.

283
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,120
An old idea for a ballet.
I call it 'Trenches'.

284
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,280
It is about the first
world war.

285
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,160
I will need a lot of dancers...

286
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,160
...because in the war there
are a lot of soldiers.

287
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,000
But everyone dances in Geneva.
It is great.

288
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,920
I want female dancers too, because
the soldier when dying...

289
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,760
...lets his soul
get out of his body...

290
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,720
...the ghost of which
will be a female dancer.

291
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,760
With a white classic skirt
like 'Giselle'...

292
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,520
...but with red stains of blood.

293
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,920
Very good!

294
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,960
Alicia loved it.

295
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,000
It's good because life emerges
out of death.

296
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,920
the female emerges from
the male.

297
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,240
And from the earthly emerges the...

298
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,040
The beach?

299
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,480
And from the earthly emerges the...

300
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
The water?

301
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,720
The ethereal.

302
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,840
The ethereal...
the impreceptible, the ghost.

303
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,800
I have the music. It is from
Kristof Penderesky.

304
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,040
It was written for the victims
of Hiroshima, but it's OK.

305
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,240
Of course. Alicia remembers
it perfectly well.

306
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,720
It's music for the battle.
It's wild and beastly.

307
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,760
And regarding the music during deaths
I have a masterpiece...

308
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,200
...which you will listen to,
right now.

309
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,040
It will drive you crazy.

310
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,680
Alicia, my dear.

311
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,560
Good bye, my dear.

312
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,560
Good bye, Katerina.
And you look beautiful.

313
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,920
-You should go ahead with 'Trenches'.
-I will.

314
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,280
Look...We will place you
next to the window.

315
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,960
You will be able to see your
friends dancing.

316
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,440
I love this room.

317
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,720
I will order everything.

318
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,480
Come in and shut the door...

319
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,920
How are you?...Shit down.

320
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,880
Alicia, look who's here.

321
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,720
We're just getting some air,
reading magazines...

322
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,680
Who was the lady that just left?

323
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,400
Katerina, Alicia's teacher.

324
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,920
Dancing teacher.

325
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,440
Nice character, Katerina.

326
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,920
She has a dancing school somewhere
here. Alicia was her student.

327
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,240
And Katerina loves her like
her daughter.

328
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,040
FOUR YEARS AGO

329
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,960
Benigno, You are by the window
for half an hour.

330
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,120
I am coming, mum.

331
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,280
What's the matter? Are you
following me?

332
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,400
This is yours, I think.
It must have dropped you.

333
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,160
is everything there?...
I didn't touch anything...

334
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,680
-Where are you going?
-Home.

335
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,040
Can I accompany you?
I have nothing else to do.

336
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,120
-Yes, but I am going home.
-Of course...It will do me good.

337
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,120
Dancing is my life.
I love dancing shows.

338
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,680
-Do you like dancing?
-Yes, of course

339
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,000
But I don't follow it.

340
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,640
What else do you do,
besides dancing?

341
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,440
I travel and watch old movies.

342
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,600
Silent Cinema is attractive
to me, in particular.

343
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,240
-Where do you go when you go out?
-I don't.

344
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,400
You should go out.

345
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,680
I was taking care of my mother,
but she passed away 2 months ago.

346
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,480
I am sorry. Mine died too,
years ago though.

347
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,480
Here we are...
Thanks for the wallet.

348
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,000
Dr Roncero, psychiatrist.
7th left.

349
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,080
Twenty three.

350
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,600
I was waiting for her by the window,
but that day she didn't come.

351
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,280
But I knew her address and that
her father was a psychiatrist.

352
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,440
Dr Roncero's office.

353
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:01,120
I would like to make an
appointment.

354
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,080
-Is it tomorrow at 5 OK?
-Isn't earlier possible?

355
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,560
No, tomorrow at 5.

356
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,760
Your name?

357
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,000
-What do you want?
-I have an appointment at 5.

358
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,280
Come in. Don't stand there.

359
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,160
Benigno Martin?...
I need some proof.

360
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,200
I just wanted to see Alicia,
but I was there, in a psychiatrist.

361
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,440
I decided to tell him I missed
my mother.

362
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,040
I started when I was little.

363
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:10,720
And all those 15 years
you took care of your mother?

364
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,080
I was always next to her...
I was studying to be a nurse.

365
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,760
I was only going out to the
classes.

366
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:24,000
I was also studying aesthetics,
make-up and hairdressing.

367
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,440
But those by post.

368
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,320
So you did those on your mother?

369
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,240
Of course, and I cut her hair,
dyed it, did her nails.

370
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,280
And I scrubbed her down well,
front and back.

371
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,800
My mother wasn't disabled, or mad.

372
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,400
She was only a bit lazy.

373
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:48,120
She was a beautiful woman
and I didn't want to let herself go.

374
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,200
-What did your father say?
-Nothing. What could he?

375
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,320
-Is he dead?
-God, no.

376
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,400
He is in Sweden, I guess.
I haven't heard of him for years.

377
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,160
Doesn't he come to see you?

378
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,480
He has his own family there,
after he left my mother.

379
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,640
We are not in touch.

380
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,960
Why did you come to see me,
Benigno?

381
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,240
-What's your problem?
-Me? Nothing.

382
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:25,360
You must have since you came
to see a psychiatrist.

383
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,520
Loneliness, I guess.

384
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,360
Did you have a sexual
relationship with a woman?

385
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,000
-With a man?
-No, neither.

386
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,080
I will see you in a week.

387
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,480
-Am I not well doctor?
-That's not it...

388
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:53,520
However, your adolescence was
kind of special.

389
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,080
-It wasn't special.
-It was. Very special.

390
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,280
And we must analyse it in depth.

391
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,400
Yes, lets analyse it.

392
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,240
-Should I come in a week?
-Very well.

393
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,040
I am glad.

394
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,480
-What are you doing here?
-I was just going. Don't be angry.

395
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,000
I just wanted to see you...
But I am harmless.

396
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:11,000
Dr Roncero's office...
Hi, Lola...

397
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:15,200
I just had a shit of
huge dimensions.

398
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:04,040
Can you be in charge?

399
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:23,640
Alicia never came back. I
didn't want to scare her again.

400
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,640
After a week I went to her
place, to see her father.

401
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:31,200
It was raining during that
whole week.

402
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,400
Next time I saw her was here.

403
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,120
What happened to her?

404
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,280
A car accident,
during a rainy day.

405
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,600
Her father didn't want her to
be alone, not even for a moment.

406
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,200
He asked for the best nurses.

407
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:57,960
And I have a good reputation here...
So they suggested me...

408
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:03,280
And when he saw me, he remembered
me, and hesitated for a moment.

409
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,240
But in the end, he took
Matilde and me, exclusively.

410
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:11,280
And this was four years ago...
And here we are now...

411
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,200
Right, Alicia?

412
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,920
I started going to the ballet,
when I had a day-off.

413
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:24,520
And to the film library to watch
silent movies.

414
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,000
German, american, italian
films, everything.

415
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,320
And afterwards I would tell her
about all that she had seen.

416
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,920
The four most complete years
of my life.

417
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,120
I take care of Alicia...

418
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,880
I do what she would, except
the trips, of course.

419
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,120
With me and Lydia
it's the opposite.

420
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,440
I can't touch her.

421
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,640
I don't recognize her body.

422
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,720
Neither can I help the nurses
turn her around.

423
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,440
And I feel I am lousy.

424
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:05,400
Talk to her. Tell her that.

425
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,720
I would like to,
but she can't hear me.

426
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,560
How are you so certain
about this?

427
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,760
Her brain is dead, Benigno.

428
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:17,960
The woman's mind is a mystery,
especially in such sickness.

429
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,160
You must look after the woman,
talk to her...

430
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,200
...don't foget that she's alive
and that you love her.

431
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:30,320
This is the only therapy.
I know from experience.

432
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,800
And what do you know
about women?

433
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,120
Benigno, what do you know
about women?

434
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,520
What do you know about women?

435
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:51,040
A lot. 20 years next to one,
4 with another.

436
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,960
I like the bullfighter's boyfriend.
He has style.

437
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,920
How do you know? You saw him?

438
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,040
Of course not, but I can tell
from his face.

439
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,320
And his bulging trousers.

440
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,840
He is a good friend of
Benigno, right;

441
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:19,200
-Is he gay too?
-No way. What are you saying now?

442
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,360
-Is Benigno, you think?
-Rumours say so!

443
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,880
-You are wrong.
-Dr Vega told me so as well.

444
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,680
-And where did he find out?
-From Alicia's father.

445
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,960
I don't like the intimacy
he has with the patient...

446
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,560
...but Vega told me not to
worry, becayse he is gay.

447
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,000
I am going and I'll let you
carry on talking crap about him.

448
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,640
-She likes Benigno.
-She is not with her senses.

449
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,640
I have the day off.
I am going to the film library.

450
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,760
-Are you coming?
-I will see my publisher tonight.

451
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,600
I have to go back to work soon.

452
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,120
This woman is not well.

453
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,680
You know what I mean.
Her skin is dry.

454
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,080
lets see... Here...

455
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:24,200
-Did you talk to her?
-No, and don't insist.

456
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,120
Hi, Lydia. You must be
patient with him.

457
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,560
Have a good time at work.

458
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,880
'Shrinked lover'.

459
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,920
Rosa has the flu.
I hope you didn't get it from her.

460
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:17,560
I am glad you feel well,
but I will massage you...

461
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,640
...and I will rub you with
a rosemary lotion.

462
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,520
No, nothing is happening to me.

463
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:53,000
Last night I saw a movie that
shook me a lot.

464
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,440
It was the love story...

465
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:02,800
...of Alfredo, a nice young
guy, but a bit fat...

466
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:07,280
...kai Amparo's friend
who is a scientist.

467
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,080
Amparo prepares a new
experimental diet...

468
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,400
...that will revolutionize
the food industry.

469
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,280
What egoism! You only
think of yourself!

470
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,120
I found it!

471
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,600
It might be dangerous. I never
gave it to a human before.

472
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,160
You still think I act
with selfishness?

473
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,600
It has done miracles for you!

474
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,520
Don't worry, my love!
I will find the antidote!

475
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,400
Time was passing by...

476
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,360
...but Amparo couldn't find
the antidote...

477
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,080
...and poor Alfredo,
day by day, shrank in misery.

478
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,160
I will always love you.

479
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,880
So that Amparo doesn't suffer...

480
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,600
...Alfredo leaves and goes
to find his mother.

481
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:30,880
He hadn't seen her for 10 years,
beacause he was lousy.

482
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,960
He hadn't told Ambaro
where his mother lived.

483
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:38,640
Lots of things going on
in this movie.

484
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,840
But the most important
thing is...

485
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,760
...after years full of
regrets and studies...

486
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:52,160
...Amparo finds the address
of his mother.

487
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,800
And goes there.

488
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,280
Hotel Iukali.
Room 15.

489
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,240
-Sleep, my darling.
-And what if I be a burden by mistake?

490
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,000
And Alfredo...

491
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,240
...stays inside her...

492
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,280
...for ever.

493
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,680
AFTER ONE MONTH

494
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:21,720
Come on, put your hands
correctly ... This way...

495
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,400
It's quite cool...
It's great...

496
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,800
It's nice here by
the balcony, right?

497
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:37,120
Lydia likes to sit by
the balcony as well.

498
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,400
Did you hear that? She likes
it a lot.

499
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:45,200
Look at them... It's as if
they are talking about us.

500
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,600
What do you think they say?

501
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,880
They have no shame.

502
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,240
Women talk about everything
with each other.

503
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:01,480
Lydia would tell her she has
completed two months sick.

504
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,240
Benjamin and Angela...

505
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:43,360
...will you bond in marriage,
with your own will?

506
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,120
Join your hands together...

507
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:54,600
...and declare your wish
in front of God.

508
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,840
I, Angela,
take you, Benjamin...

509
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:05,480
...to be my lawful husband...

510
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:09,480
I will love you
in happiness and in sickness...

511
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:14,040
...so long as we shall both live.

512
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,480
The Lord that joined you in love...

513
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:22,960
...let him accept your declaration
of love today.

514
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:27,040
May your love last eternally.

515
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,840
What are you doing here? We
were gonna meet at the hotel.

516
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:34,960
I changed my mind.
I've always liked weddings.

517
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:38,520
Weren't you gonna see
your sister before the game?

518
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:41,720
I called her.
She will come to the hotel.

519
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,920
I promised her we will eat at
the restaurant tonight.

520
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,840
As you wish.

521
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,360
-Nice ceremony, right?
-Excellent.

522
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:02,440
-I didn't expect her so young.
-You don't trust me right?

523
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,720
We can't have another day
passing by without talking.

524
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:11,200
Don't worry. Finish with Angela,
I have proof.

525
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:15,640
For example, at the ceremony
I didn't cry, you did.

526
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:18,480
-Right.
-And you shouldn't have.

527
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,680
Don't you believe me?

528
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:25,120
I needed 10 years to get over
it. I finally made it.

529
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,280
Lydia, trust me,
it's over.

530
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,440
I travelled with Angela.

531
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,960
The excuse was to write
a travel guide.

532
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:41,680
In reality, I wanted her
out of Madrid and drugs.

533
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:46,320
Madrid is hell. Our relationship
functioned outside it.

534
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:50,680
After five trips,
I brought her to her parents...

535
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:54,760
...who kept her away
from drugs and from me.

536
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,400
Did you still love her?

537
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I cried not being able to share
things with her.

538
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,960
It's terrible to leave
a person you love so much.

539
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,840
What a sad story!

540
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,920
Love is a sad thing when
it ends...

541
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,360
...as the song says.

542
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,360
Marco, we need to talk afterwards.

543
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,520
-We've been talking for an hour.
-You have, not me.

544
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:27,200
You're right.

545
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,840
My leg needs two months of therapy,
said the doctor.

546
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:59,120
But you know what? I am glad
that bull hit me.

547
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:02,800
Now I can stay with you until
you wake up.

548
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,240
No one will take me away from you.

549
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:10,120
We got back together,
a month ago...

550
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:15,240
Lydia would tell you at the
wedding. She didn't in the end.

551
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:20,680
It was you she cried for.

552
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:27,240
She called me to tell me
she cried for me.

553
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:31,400
Last time we spoke.

554
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,760
Now that I don't fight
due to injury...

555
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,920
...I would like to stay
near her during the night.

556
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,200
Like at your place.

557
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,880
I am alone again.

558
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,520
You were looking at her breasts.

559
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,600
Difficult to avoid it.
They grow by the day.

560
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:33,400
Benigno, I am thinking of taking
a trip... I have to work.

561
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,880
And Lydia?

562
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,800
She doesn't need me anymore.

563
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,720
Did you break up?

564
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,560
You can call it that way.

565
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:50,520
I expected this, Marco.
Don't ask why, I just did.

566
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:56,560
There was something in your
relationship that didn't function right.

567
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,920
When are you going?

568
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,800
Soon, but I'll see you before
I go.

569
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,440
I am so sorry you are going.

570
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,160
I am leaving, Benigno.
I'll see you soon.

571
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:18,000
She didn't have her period yet?

572
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:23,400
I am looking at the month's report.
She should have had it.

573
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,080
Yes, it's a bit late.

574
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:42,720
Two weeks. That's a lot.
Are you sure she had it last month?

575
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:47,480
I personally dealt with it.
It was when you had the flu.

576
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,920
She seems a bit swollen.

577
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,760
They often have abnormalities.

578
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,040
For example, Lydia
doesn't have a period anymore.

579
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,120
Anyway, we should tell Dr Vega.

580
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,560
I brought some of my guides
for Alicia and you.

581
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,560
I said goodbye to Lydia.

582
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:32,280
I went to see Alicia, but they
didn't let me enter the room.

583
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:36,360
Is there something wrong?

584
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:39,720
No. Just some infection
that Alicia got.

585
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,880
Can you drive me home?
I am done with work.

586
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,960
-It's not serious, I hope.
-I don't know.

587
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:49,880
They do some medical exams,
but they haven't told me anything.

588
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,920
Brazil...

589
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,160
...Turkey, Cuba.

590
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,080
-I will read them to Alicia.
-They are guides.

591
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:03,360
Yours. They must be good.

592
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,880
-Are you travelling alone?
-Yes.

593
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:09,200
I would like to talk to you
about this before you go.

594
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,680
-About what?
-loneliness.

595
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,120
I want to get married.

596
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:20,680
-Alicia, of course!
-Benigno, you are nuts!

597
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:23,720
We will get along better than
most couples.

598
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:26,960
-Why shouldn't I marry her?
-Because she is in a coma!

599
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,200
Because she can't say 'yes'
in the church!

600
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:36,160
Because, she is virtually dead!

601
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,000
Get in the car!

602
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,440
-What are you talking about?
-Get in the car!

603
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:49,880
Your relationship with Alicia
is a crazy monologue!

604
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:53,680
We often talk to PVS,
but we don't marry them.

605
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:58,080
Incredible what you are saying.
I had a different opinion of you.

606
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:01,880
Don't say or think about it
ever again!

607
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:07,040
Promise!...If you say that to
anyone else, you will be in trouble!

608
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,080
If that calms you down,
then I promise.

609
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:15,360
-Regardless of how much you like her...
-You like her too, right?

610
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,440
Of course I like her.

611
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,680
-She likes you too.
-She is virtually dead!

612
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:25,560
She has no feelings about me,
you, or herself!

613
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:28,080
Understand that!

614
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:36,880
Our patient Alicia Roncero
was raped and is pregnant.

615
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,160
Before I tell her father
I want you to tell me...

616
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:43,200
...which bastard did it!

617
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,560
Everyone is upset.

618
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:49,240
You are responsible. Alicia
was on your floor.

619
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,680
Then allow me to explain the
situation.

620
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,480
Rosa, please.

621
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,400
Alicia's period stopped
two months ago.

622
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:04,760
I thought it was one month
initially, but I was wrong.

623
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:08,000
It wasn't in last month's report.

624
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:11,200
It says it was dealt with normally.

625
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:14,640
I was down with flu
during that week.

626
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,560
You wrote that.
Right, Benigno?

627
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,840
-It is your typewriting.
-Yes, it was me.

628
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,880
Why did you lie?

629
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,840
I didn't want it to become a problem.

630
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,280
On other occasions, the patients'
periods have also stopped.

631
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:36,480
How come no one noticed?
Where is the night person?

632
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,880
She can't come today.
She phoned.

633
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,120
Didn't see notice anything strange?

634
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:46,320
She has problems at home.
A lot of nights she doesn't come.

635
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,120
And who replaces her?

636
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,680
I will tell Roncero
that his daughter...

637
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,840
...is day and night with
a nutter?

638
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:01,080
Lets calm down for a bit.

639
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:07,760
Benigno, do you realise you
are the prime suspect?

640
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,720
Why did you hide the first delay?

641
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:15,920
What explanation do you have?
Would you ever harm Alicia?

642
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:18,040
Definitely not!

643
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,200
Last night I was
at the parkin lot...

644
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:30,000
...and overheard a discussion
between Benigno and Marco.

645
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:33,480
Benigno said he wanted to
marry Alicia.

646
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:37,680
Marco tried to change his mind,
but in vain.

647
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,840
Lots of couples, he said...

648
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:46,160
...don'r get along
as well as him and Alicia.

649
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:51,720
AFTER EIGHT MONTHS

650
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:11,360
It was Lydia Gonzales' funeral
yesterday, at Almudena.

651
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:17,760
The thirty-year old bullfighter
was in a coma since...

652
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,720
Can I speak with
Benigno Martin?

653
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,800
He doesn't work here anymore.

654
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,120
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

655
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,960
-And sister Rosa Lazaga;
-Who are you?

656
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:34,520
-Marco Zuloaga.
-I will put you through.

657
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,800
-Who is it?
-Marco Zuloaga.

658
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:45,720
I am calling from Jordan.
I found out about Lydia.

659
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:48,160
I am sorry, Marco.

660
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,160
You should have called me.

661
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,960
We had a lot of problems here.

662
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,320
What happened? Benigno isn't
there anymore, I was told.

663
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,800
Benigno is in jail.

664
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,280
He is accused of raping Alicia.

665
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:13,760
Help him. He has no one
the poor guy.

666
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,800
Did you go see him?

667
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,600
After what he did, I can't.

668
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:22,000
However he does need help,
and you are his friend.

669
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,560
-What prison is he in?
-In Zegovia.

670
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,920
Wait for me here.

671
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:35,080
-I want to see a prisoner.
-In the visting section.

672
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:37,520
Through this door,on the left.

673
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:51,360
I want prisoner Benigno Martin.

674
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,360
It isn't a visting day,
but I will see whether...

675
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:56,480
I am sorry, I can't hear you.

676
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:00,000
It isn't a visiting day.

677
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,800
And the lodger didn't ask
for a visit.

678
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:07,400
He doesn't know I am in Madrid.
I came today.

679
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:11,040
-Are you a relative?
-A friend.

680
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:14,840
-Marco Zuloaga is my name.
-Can I see your I.D.?

681
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,400
-Can I call him?
-He will call you.

682
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:25,160
I have changed number. Can you
give him the new one?

683
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,120
And remember.

684
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:39,400
Visiting days are Saturday
and Sunday.

685
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:43,520
But the lodger should ask for
the visit.

686
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,920
If he doesn't want to see you,
there is nothing we can do.

687
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:52,360
And something else. We don't
have prisoners here...

688
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:57,640
We don't have prisoners here,
we have lodgers.

689
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:35,360
Marco, is that you?

690
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:40,440
I am glad to hear your voice.
I asked your visit on Saturday.

691
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,040
-Where are you?
-Outside the clinique.

692
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:51,040
Dr Vega told me everything.
How could you do it?

693
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,800
Did you come back to Spain
to get on my back?

694
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:59,040
Do you need anything?
What should I bring you on Saturday?

695
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:02,640
I need information.
What do you know about Alicia?

696
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,880
They wouldn't say anything
from the clinique.

697
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,320
She is in a different one.
They don't know where.

698
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:10,200
-I don't believe this.
-Neither do I.

699
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:13,000
But I am not surpised they
won't tell us.

700
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,720
-Are you still my friend?
-Of course. Since I am here.

701
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,120
Then find out about Alicia.

702
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,800
Whether she's alive, whether she gave
birth, whether the baby is alive...

703
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,680
I need to know, Marco...
You understand, right?

704
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:33,560
I will try to...
Talk to you on Saturday...

705
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:39,080
-Did you find out anything?
-I will. Be patient.

706
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:44,520
I was, until the day she would
give birth. One month ago.

707
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,480
You must wait.

708
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:57,640
-What do you do during the day here?
-I work in the recovery room.

709
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:02,800
It's a new prison, few people.
It's quiet in here.

710
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:06,760
-It doesn't look like a prison from outside.
-The problem is elsewhere!

711
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,080
That I don't see Alicia.

712
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:14,720
The doctor ki o Dr Roncero
say I am a psychopath.

713
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:21,840
This is good for the trail, they say,
but I don't care about the trial.

714
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:26,120
I need to see Alicia,
to find out how everything went.

715
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:30,800
If this goes on, I don't
know what I am capable of doing!

716
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,200
I am a psychopath, they say?
Then I will act like one!

717
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,120
Don't say that, Benigno!

718
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:40,480
And find me another lawyer.
The one I have despises me.

719
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:47,040
I will rent my place so that
I can pay him.

720
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:50,520
I will rent it.
I am currently homeless.

721
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,760
Great. I am glad you will be
my tenant.

722
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:58,440
I was thinking about you a lot,
especially during the nights.

723
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,560
-Why during the nights?
-Because I study during the nights.

724
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,480
I read all your guides.

725
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:09,200
Like travelling with you
next to me...

726
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,600
...telling me things.

727
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,920
I liked Avan's the most.

728
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:17,400
I became one with those people...

729
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:20,520
...that have nothing
and invent everything.

730
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:24,640
And you describing
the Cuban girl...

731
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:27,560
...in front of her window
by the sea...

732
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,600
...waiting in vain...

733
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:33,160
...for something that will
never happen.

734
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,720
I was thinking that woman is me.

735
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,880
Good morning. I am Benigno's
friend.

736
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,120
You are Marco, the Argentinian?

737
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:06,120
Benigno called me.
Will you take his appartment?

738
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:11,160
It will be dirty. He wouldn't
let me in to clean it.

739
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:16,560
-And I didn't want any money...
-It's OK, I will take care of it.

740
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:20,480
Shall I give you the key?...
I will go look for it...

741
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,960
Did you see him?

742
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,800
-How is he?
-Well.

743
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,920
Poor guy, he wasn't even lucky
during his imprisonment.

744
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,120
No publicity!

745
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:44,240
No TV, no reporters.
No one came here.

746
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:47,880
They didn't condescend!
And they show such garbage!

747
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,960
I would give them an interview!

748
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,720
The media is shit in this country!

749
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,800
You are right.

750
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,320
The keys...

751
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:02,280
Anyway...Do you know why
Benigno is in prison?

752
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:06,840
He is very quiet. He didn't say
a word last time he came.

753
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:10,360
-Benigno is innocent.
-Yes, I know.

754
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,520
-Innocent about what?
-I don't know.

755
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:17,000
You do, but you don't want
to tell me.

756
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,360
If you need something,
you know where I am.

757
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:22,760
I was glad you stepped in
by yourself today, without crutches.

758
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,960
-How did the exercise go today?
-Very well.

759
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:30,120
-Were you tired?
-A lot.

760
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:33,600
It doesn't matter. We will
do some extra exercises.

761
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:37,520
We will do some stretches.

762
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:41,520
-But I already did 100.
-We'll do a few more.

763
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,760
I have an appointment with
Mr. Sainz.

764
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,920
The boy was born dead.

765
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:30,120
Alicia recovered.
Benigno hasn't found out.

766
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:33,320
In his condition,
he could do something crazy.

767
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:37,440
I can't lie to him.
He is my only friend.

768
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:41,360
I will tell him.
I have no problem.

769
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:44,880
Alicia is still in coma and
the baby dead, I will say.

770
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,920
But you don't tell him anything.

771
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:52,520
-Can he bail out?
-Very difficult, and expensive.

772
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:22,720
-You are wet.
-A little.

773
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:27,360
Be careful not to catch a cold.
Drink hot milk with honey.

774
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:42,320
Since I am here,
I like rainy days.

775
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:47,400
DId you see the new lawyer?

776
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:54,120
He was here...
he told me everything...

777
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:00,080
-I will loose, right?
-Frankly, yes, you will.

778
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:03,480
At least nothing happened to
Alicia during birth.

779
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:08,040
It's the only thing that consoles
me and gives me hope.

780
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,960
Are you ok, Benigno?

781
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:19,200
I would like to hug you
so much, Marco.

782
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:24,200
But I have to ask for a meeting
face to face.

783
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:26,240
I tried.

784
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:30,680
They asked me whether you are
my lover.

785
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:34,880
I didn't dare say 'yes' since
that would annoy you.

786
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:39,440
It wouldn't annoy me at all.
You can say whatever you want.

787
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:43,240
I have hugged very few people
in my life.

788
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,160
Message!

789
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:45,880
I was very happy to see you
and say goodbye today.

790
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:49,280
They won't let me get
out of here...

791
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:52,200
...or they will put me
somewhere else

792
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:55,120
I don't want to live
without Alicia...

793
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:58,760
...without being able to hold
not one pin of hers.

794
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:01,680
Therefore I will escape.

795
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:05,680
I didn't tell you so that you
won't stop me.

796
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,360
I hug you firmly, Marco.

797
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:28,400
In Zegovia...
Yes, in prison...

798
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:51,000
I urgently need to see Benigno Martin.

799
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:54,240
It's a matter of life and death.

800
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:57,560
The warden is waiting for you
in his office.

801
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,160
Me? Where is his office?

802
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:03,120
The guard will accompany you.

803
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:12,760
Empty your pockets, please.

804
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,160
Wait, don't run.

805
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,000
In there at the end.

806
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:40,520
Good morning. I am
Marco Zuloaga.

807
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:44,440
Benigno Martin left this
letter for you.

808
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:53,840
Dear Marco...

809
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,800
It's still raining, and this
is a good sign.

810
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:02,680
When Alicia had the accident,
it was raining too.

811
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:06,840
I am writing to you a few
minutes before I escape.

812
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:10,360
I hope, with all these,
to fall in a coma as well...

813
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:12,560
...and to be near her.

814
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,760
You are my only friend.

815
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:20,000
I am leaving you the house
I prepared for me and her.

816
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:26,160
Wherever they take me, come to
see me and talk to me.

817
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:30,440
Tell me everything, without
hiding anything.

818
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:33,440
Goodbye, my friend.

819
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:54,400
I took these from him and these
I found at his cell.

820
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,240
You must sign here.

821
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:16,400
Benigno, it's me.

822
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:23,200
Alicia is alive...
You woke her up.

823
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:30,960
I got your message and ran
immediately to tell you...

824
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,640
...but it was too late.

825
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:37,200
I put a pin of Alicia
in your pocket.

826
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:41,720
And a photo of hers.

827
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:45,480
And a photo of your mother.

828
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:49,600
So that they can be with you
in eternity.

829
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:14,840
Like wild waves. The male on top,
the female below.

830
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:16,800
I will bring some water.

831
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:46,840
Are you ok?

832
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:51,640
I don't know...

833
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,400
I am much better now.

834
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,600
Come on, lets go inside.

835
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:18,600
You tremble.

836
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:21,680
Why?

837
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:34,960
-What did you tell her?
-Noting.

838
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,960
I saw you talking.

839
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:40,320
She asked if I am ok, and I
thanked her.

840
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:46,600
You will see me around.
I live near the dancing school.

841
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:50,160
In Benigno's place?

842
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:54,160
-Why do you stay there?
-Benigno is dead.

843
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:02,360
One day, we should talk.

844
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:06,120
Yes, and it will be simpler
than you thought.

845
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:08,440
Nothing is simple.

846
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:11,920
I am a dancing teacher, and nothing is simple.
and nothing is simple.
