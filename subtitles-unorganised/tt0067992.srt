1
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:56,190
All right, what's it going to be?

2
00:02:56,392 --> 00:02:58,792
A Triple Cream Cup for Christopher.

3
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:01,463
A Squelchy Snorter for Otis.

4
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:04,861
A Sizzler for June Marie.
And listen!

5
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:07,366
- Wonka's got a new one today.
- What is it?

6
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,004
This one's a Scrumpdiddleumptious Bar.

7
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:13,205
Scrumpdiddleumptious Bar?
How does he do it?

8
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:15,400
Do you ask a fish how it swims?

9
00:03:15,678 --> 00:03:17,805
Or a bird how it flies?

10
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:19,038
No, you don't.

11
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:20,978
They were born to do it.

12
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:24,017
Just like Willy Wonka was born
to be a candy man...

13
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:26,913
...and you were born to be a Wonkerer.

14
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:30,383
Who can take the sunrise

15
00:03:30,593 --> 00:03:33,255
Sprinkle it with dew

16
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:37,825
Cover it in chocolate
and a miracle or two

17
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:39,695
The Candy Man!

18
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:43,038
The Candy Man can

19
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:47,508
'Cause he mixes it with love

20
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,110
And makes the world taste good

21
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:54,911
Who can take a rainbow

22
00:03:55,118 --> 00:03:57,052
Wrap it in a sigh

23
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:02,183
Soak it in the sun
And make the strawberry-lemon pie

24
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:03,689
The Candy Man?

25
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:05,554
The Candy Man!

26
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:08,293
The Candy Man can!

27
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:13,125
'Cause he mixes it with love
And makes the world...

28
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:15,564
...taste good

29
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,706
Willy Wonka makes

30
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:19,431
Everything he bakes

31
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:23,043
Satisfying and delicious

32
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:26,113
Talk about your childhood wishes

33
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:29,808
You can even eat the dishes

34
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,455
Who can take tomorrow

35
00:04:42,665 --> 00:04:44,826
Dip it in a dream

36
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:48,666
Separate the sorrow
And collect up all the cream

37
00:04:48,938 --> 00:04:51,964
- The Candy Man
- Willy Wonka can

38
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:54,837
The Candy Man can

39
00:04:56,112 --> 00:05:00,139
The Candy Man can
'Cause he mixes it with love

40
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,047
And makes the world taste good

41
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:07,652
And the world tastes good

42
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:13,962
'Cause the Candy Man thinks it should

43
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:34,774
Hi, Mr. Jopeck.

44
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:37,880
Come along, Charlie.
You're late.

45
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:41,449
It's payday, Mr. Jopeck.

46
00:05:41,657 --> 00:05:42,749
You're right.

47
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,891
- There you are.
- Thanks.

48
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:48,653
Say hello to your Grandpa Joe.

49
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:34,068
Up the airy mountain...

50
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:36,507
...down the rushing glen.

51
00:06:36,712 --> 00:06:38,873
We dare not go a-hunting...

52
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:39,946
...for fear...

53
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,117
...of little men.

54
00:06:42,385 --> 00:06:43,943
You see...

55
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:46,717
...nobody ever goes in...

56
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:52,452
...nobody ever comes out.

57
00:07:02,905 --> 00:07:04,372
Charlie's late.

58
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:07,270
He works too hard for a little boy.

59
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:09,604
He should have some time to play.

60
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:11,780
Not enough hours in the day.

61
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:14,211
With you four bedridden for 20 years...

62
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:17,284
...it takes work
to keep this family going.

63
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:19,785
If only his father were alive.

64
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:23,618
When I get my strength back,
I'll get out of bed to help him.

65
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:26,989
In all the years
you've been saying that...

66
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,263
...I've yet to see you
set foot on the floor.

67
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:34,096
Maybe if the floor wasn't so cold...

68
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:36,738
Hi, everybody!

69
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:40,169
Wake up, Charlie's home!

70
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:42,741
Grandpa George.

71
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:46,108
Grandma Georgina.

72
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:47,973
Grandma Josephine.

73
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:51,183
Grandpa Joe!

74
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:55,689
Is this your supper, Grandpa?

75
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,755
It's yours, too.

76
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,656
I'm fed up with cabbage water.
It's not enough!

77
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:01,989
It's all we have!

78
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:03,859
What are you saying?

79
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:07,431
- How about this?
- Where did you get that?

80
00:08:07,637 --> 00:08:10,765
What difference
does it make where? He got it.

81
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:12,501
My first payday.

82
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:15,506
Good for you.
We'll have a real banquet.

83
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:16,871
Mom?

84
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:20,205
Here's what's left.
You keep it.

85
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:22,510
Except for this.

86
00:08:22,718 --> 00:08:25,380
From now on,
I'm paying for your tobacco.

87
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:30,021
No one's going to pay for it.
I'm giving it up.

88
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,657
Dad, it's only one pipe a day.

89
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:36,362
When bread looks like a banquet,
I've no right to tobacco.

90
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:38,329
Go on, Grandpa.

91
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:40,725
Please take it.

92
00:08:47,243 --> 00:08:50,872
After my paper route,
I was in front of Wonka's.

93
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,344
There was this strange man there.

94
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:55,878
I think he was a tinker.

95
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:59,486
He was standing behind me
looking up at the factory.

96
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:01,816
Just before he left he said...

97
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:05,323
"Nobody ever goes in,
and nobody ever comes out."

98
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:07,553
And right he was, Charlie!

99
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:10,391
Not since the tragic day
Willy Wonka locked it.

100
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,692
Why did he?

101
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:15,233
Because all the other chocolate makers
were sending spies...

102
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:18,896
...dressed as workers to steal
Mr. Wonka's secret recipes.

103
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:23,044
Especially Slugworth.
That Slugworth was the worst!

104
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:26,241
Finally, Mr. Wonka shouted,
"I'll be ruined!"

105
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:30,351
"Close the factory!"
And that's just what he did.

106
00:09:30,553 --> 00:09:34,114
He locked the gates
and vanished completely.

107
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,257
And then, suddenly,
about three years later...

108
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,020
...the most amazing thing happened.

109
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:42,857
The factory started again,
full blast!

110
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:46,432
And more delicious candies
were coming out than ever.

111
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:49,764
But the gates stayed locked.
So that no one...

112
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:52,702
...not even Slugworth,
could steal them.

113
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:56,935
But Grandpa, someone must be helping
Mr. Wonka work the factory.

114
00:09:57,146 --> 00:09:58,943
Thousands must be.

115
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:00,115
But who?

116
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:01,977
Who are they?

117
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:05,579
That is the biggest mystery of them all.

118
00:10:07,723 --> 00:10:09,953
- Charlie Bucket?
- Yes, Mr. Turkentine?

119
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,320
I need an assistant.
Give me a hand.

120
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,396
We have nitric acid, glycerine...

121
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,727
...and a special mixture of my own.

122
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:22,733
Together it's dangerous stuff,
blows you up.

123
00:10:22,938 --> 00:10:26,965
But mixed together right,
as only I know how, what's it make?

124
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:28,575
- I don't know.
- Of course not!

125
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:30,245
Because only I know.

126
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:33,973
If you knew, you'd be teaching me
instead of me teaching you.

127
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:38,745
And for a student to teach his teacher
is presumptuous. Is that clear?

128
00:10:38,954 --> 00:10:40,251
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

129
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:44,825
Mixed together in the right way,
these dangerous ingredients...

130
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:47,257
...make the finest wart remover.

131
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:50,258
The trick is to pour equal amounts.

132
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:53,730
Charlie, you take
the nitric acid and glycerine...

133
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:56,803
...and I'll take my special mixture.
Ready?

134
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:59,167
Good lad. Pour.

135
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:02,743
Did we do it wrong?

136
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:05,675
Certainly not.
This is for big warts.

137
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:08,506
What's going on out there?

138
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,318
Come here! What's happening?

139
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:15,854
Willy Wonka's opening his factory!

140
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,251
Are you sure?

141
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,587
He's giving lots of chocolate away!

142
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:21,956
- Class dismissed!
- It's only for 5 people!

143
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:24,660
Class un-dismissed.

144
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:27,768
He hid 5 Golden Tickets.
Whoever finds them wins the prize.

145
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,371
- Where'd he hide them?
- Inside 5 Wonka Bars, you must buy them.

146
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,971
Class re-dismissed!

147
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:47,280
Now, details of the announcement...

148
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,015
...that has captured
the world's attention.

149
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:52,854
Hidden among the billions
of Wonka Bars...

150
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:54,962
...are 5 Gold Tickets.

151
00:11:55,164 --> 00:11:59,533
And to the 5 people who find them
will come the most fabulous prize.

152
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:02,033
A lifetime supply of chocolate.

153
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:05,969
If this were not enough, each winner,
before receiving his prize...

154
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:07,972
...will be personally escorted...

155
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:09,542
They're all crazy!

156
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:11,042
The man's a genius!

157
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:12,908
He'll sell a million bars.

158
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,711
Do you think I've got a chance
to find one?

159
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,581
One?! I'm counting on you
to find all five!

160
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:21,152
One's enough for me.

161
00:12:21,357 --> 00:12:22,551
We have reports...

162
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:25,386
...the response is phenomenal!
Wonka Bars...

163
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:27,391
...are disappearing...

164
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:29,826
...at a rate to boggle the mind.

165
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:31,499
It is incredible...

166
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,498
...the way Wonkamania
has descended upon the globe.

167
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:38,230
While the world searches,
we watch and wait, wondering...

168
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:42,070
...where it will lead,
and how long the spirit will hold up...

169
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:43,336
...under the strain.

170
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:47,676
I still have these dreams, Doctor,
And I still can't stop believing them.

171
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:49,748
I've told you, Mr. Hoffstedder...

172
00:12:49,952 --> 00:12:52,750
...to believe in dreams
is a manifestation of insanity.

173
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:55,788
The sooner you accept this,
the sooner you'll get well.

174
00:12:56,392 --> 00:13:01,056
I dreamed the Archangel whispered into
my ear where to find a Golden Ticket.

175
00:13:02,064 --> 00:13:03,429
What did he say?

176
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:06,760
What difference does that make?
This was a dream.

177
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:10,063
- You said...
- Shut up and tell me where's the ticket!

178
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:12,374
We begin with 5 Golden Tickets.

179
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:17,205
Like 5 lucky bolts of lightning
ready to strike at any point on the map.

180
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:20,280
No one knew where or when
the first one would hit.

181
00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:22,951
But last night we got our answer.

182
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:26,451
While America slept,
the first Golden Ticket was found...

183
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,715
...in the small town of
Duselheim, Germany.

184
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:34,419
We've been waiting for the story,
and we're ready with a live report.

185
00:13:35,097 --> 00:13:37,964
Proud we are,
for the attention of the world...

186
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,294
...focuses today here in Duselheim.

187
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:42,971
A community thrust into prominence...

188
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:46,801
...by the discovery of
the first Wonka Golden Ticket.

189
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:49,978
Its finder is the son
of a prominent butcher.

190
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:52,875
The boys name, Augustus Gloop!

191
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:58,146
The pride of Duselheim,
the fame of Western Germany.

192
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:01,152
An example for the whole world.

193
00:14:01,357 --> 00:14:04,326
How does it feel to be
the first Golden Ticket finder?

194
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:06,154
- Hungry.
- Any other feelings?

195
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:09,354
Sorry for Wonka.
It'll cost him a fortune in fudge.

196
00:14:09,798 --> 00:14:11,959
Mr. Gloop, would you mind...

197
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:16,093
Mrs. Gloop, would you say
a few words to the audience?

198
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:20,173
I knew he would find a Golden Ticket.
Eating is his hobby.

199
00:14:20,376 --> 00:14:24,039
He wouldn't do it unless
he needed the nourishment.

200
00:14:26,982 --> 00:14:29,041
Happy birthday, Charlie!

201
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:32,350
Here you are, Charlie.

202
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:33,988
Thank you.

203
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:41,696
It's terrific!

204
00:14:41,897 --> 00:14:45,128
We each knitted, Grandmas
Georgina, Josephine and me.

205
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:47,859
I did the end pieces with the tassels.

206
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,369
And here's a little gift
from Grandpa George and me.

207
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:53,906
I think I know what this is.

208
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,538
- It is! A Wonka!
- Open it, Charlie.

209
00:14:57,746 --> 00:14:59,043
Let's see that Golden Ticket.

210
00:14:59,248 --> 00:15:01,682
- Wouldn't it be fantastic?
- Don't raise his hopes.

211
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:04,882
Never mind. Open it.
I want to see that gold!

212
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:06,315
Stop it!

213
00:15:06,522 --> 00:15:09,889
- I've got the same chance as anybody!
- You've got more.

214
00:15:10,092 --> 00:15:11,582
You want it more.

215
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,225
Go on, open it!

216
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:15,021
Here goes!

217
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:19,265
- I got it!
- Where?

218
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:20,691
Let's see!

219
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:22,867
Fooled you, didn't I?

220
00:15:23,105 --> 00:15:25,039
You thought I really had it.

221
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,510
Never mind, Charlie.

222
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:30,269
You'll find one.

223
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:34,038
- Here, everybody have a bite.
- No, no!

224
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,993
I wanted to find the first
Golden ticket, Daddy!

225
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,395
I know, angel.
We're doing the best we can.

226
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:55,331
I've got every girl on staff
hunting for you.

227
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,732
Where is it?
Why can't they find it?

228
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,103
Veruca, sweetheart,
I'm not a magician!

229
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,567
Give me time!

230
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:05,906
I want it now!
What's the matter with those twerps?

231
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:09,573
For five days now,
the entire factory's been on the job!

232
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:12,515
They haven't shelled a peanut
since Monday!

233
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:16,213
They've been shelling
chocolate bars from dawn to dusk!

234
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:17,756
Work nights!

235
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:21,559
Come along, you girls!

236
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:24,597
Put a jerk in it,
or you'll be out on your ears!

237
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,562
And listen: The first girl...

238
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:31,229
...that finds a Golden Ticket
gets a bonus in their pay packet!

239
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,101
What do you think of that?!

240
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,677
They're not even trying!

241
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,211
They don't want to find it!

242
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:41,609
Sweetheart,
I can't push them no harder.

243
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:44,182
19,000 bars an hour they're shelling!

244
00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:46,752
760,000 they've done so far!

245
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:48,013
You promised!

246
00:16:48,223 --> 00:16:50,851
You promised I'd have it the first day!

247
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,928
You're going to be very unpopular
if you don't deliver soon.

248
00:16:55,164 --> 00:16:58,429
It breaks my heart.
I hate to see her unhappy.

249
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:00,192
I won't talk to you!

250
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:03,701
You're a rotten father!
You never give me anything!

251
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:05,703
I won't go to school!

252
00:17:05,908 --> 00:17:08,468
Veruca! Sweetheart! Angel!

253
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:11,439
There are only 4 tickets
left in the world...

254
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:14,275
...and the whole world's
hunting for them!

255
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:15,313
What can I do?

256
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:18,815
I got it, Mr. Salt! Here it is!

257
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:23,758
About time, too! I want it!

258
00:17:28,664 --> 00:17:31,633
Give me my ticket! It's mine!

259
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:34,325
I found the Golden Ticket!

260
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:41,066
Thank God!

261
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:44,404
Happiness is what counts with children.

262
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:46,672
Happiness and harmony.

263
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:51,909
This is the sign of our times.
The symbol of the havoc...

264
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:54,817
...the mad craze
that's sweeping the world.

265
00:17:55,023 --> 00:17:59,153
Whatever corner of the globe we are in,
whichever continent we're on...

266
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:02,956
...the great Wonka Bar search continues.
We're near the end...

267
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:06,963
...of our 43rd day
in the Golden Ticket hunt.

268
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:09,300
Everywhere, are signs of anxiety.

269
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:11,265
Every hour...

270
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:14,135
...new shipments
are sent around the globe.

271
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:16,467
But they're not moving fast enough.

272
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:21,115
And as time passes the men who seek them
become more and more desperate.

273
00:18:21,316 --> 00:18:25,446
Gentlemen, I know how anxious
you've been during these last few days.

274
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:28,020
But now I think I can safely say...

275
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,953
...that your time and money
have been well spent.

276
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:35,159
We're about to witness
the greatest miracle of the machine age.

277
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:39,198
Based on the revolutionary
law of probability, this machine...

278
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:43,462
...will tell us the precise location
of the three remaining...

279
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:45,567
...Golden Tickets.

280
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:55,043
It says...

281
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:58,083
..."I won't tell.
That would be cheating."

282
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:06,824
I am now telling the computer...

283
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:11,056
...if it will tell me the correct answer
I will gladly share with it...

284
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:13,029
...the grand prize.

285
00:19:17,706 --> 00:19:18,331
He says...

286
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:23,273
..."What would a computer do
with a lifetime supply of chocolate?"

287
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:32,352
I am now telling the computer exactly
what he can do with the chocolate.

288
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,021
It can happen here, too,
unbelievable as it sounds...

289
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:39,854
...right here in America.

290
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:44,021
Where even in the smallest town,
the happiest dreams can come true.

291
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:46,129
Here she is...

292
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:50,199
...Violet Beauregarde,
finder of Golden Ticket number 3.

293
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:52,100
From Miles City, Montana.

294
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:53,706
And the proud parents.

295
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:57,106
Mr. Beauregarde,
a local politician, civic leader...

296
00:19:57,312 --> 00:19:59,439
Sam Beauregarde,
Square Deal Sam to you...

297
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:01,582
...with great giveaway bargains.

298
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:04,217
The finest values in the entire country!

299
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:06,546
- Here's a sedan...
- Dad, they don't want you!

300
00:20:06,755 --> 00:20:08,586
- Care to say a few words?
- Sure!

301
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:11,987
Here is Golden Ticket number 3,
and it's all mine!

302
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:16,060
I'm a gum chewer,
but when I heard about the tickets...

303
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:18,392
...I laid off gum and switched to candy.

304
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:20,964
Now, of course, I'm back on gum.

305
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,071
I chew it all day, except at mealtimes
when I stick it behind my ear.

306
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:25,730
- Violet!
- Cool it, Mother!

307
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:30,810
This piece of gum I've been chewing
for three months. A world record!

308
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:34,244
It beat the record
held by my friend, Cornelia...

309
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:36,246
...and was she mad!

310
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:37,918
Hi Cornelia, sweetie!

311
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,021
Let me just say,
if any of you folks watching...

312
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:55,765
- What are you doing here?
- I'll walk you home.

313
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:59,266
I'm not ready.
I'm going to be here late.

314
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:02,102
Then I guess I'll be going.

315
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:04,006
Why not stay a minute.

316
00:21:04,212 --> 00:21:07,306
Pull up a pile of clothes and sit down.

317
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:11,443
School all right?

318
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:12,449
Yep.

319
00:21:12,654 --> 00:21:13,712
Good.

320
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:16,148
Go on your newspaper route?

321
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:17,358
Just finished.

322
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:18,651
Good.

323
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,389
I wanted to tell you something.

324
00:21:26,234 --> 00:21:27,963
They found the third ticket.

325
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,398
Did they?

326
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:34,836
I guess I'll be going now.

327
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:37,338
That's all?

328
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,480
I thought you'd like to know.

329
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:44,311
Most people are pretty interested.
I know I'm interested.

330
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:47,682
There are only two tickets left,
you know. Just two.

331
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:49,720
Pretty soon, just one.

332
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:51,654
I wonder who'll be the lucky ones.

333
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,885
If you're wondering,
it won't be me.

334
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:56,997
If you're wondering,
you can count me out.

335
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:00,560
There are 100 billion people...

336
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:03,897
...and only 5 will find Golden Tickets.

337
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:07,337
Even with a sack of money,
you probably wouldn't find one.

338
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:12,172
When this is over you'll be no different
from billions of others who didn't.

339
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:15,179
But I am different.
I want it more than any of them.

340
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:19,583
You'll get your chance.
One day things will change.

341
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:22,120
When? When will they change?

342
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:24,723
Probably when you least expect it.

343
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:29,055
See you later.

344
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:46,904
You get blue like everyone

345
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:50,809
But me and Grandpa Joe

346
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:55,153
Can make your troubles go away

347
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,816
Blow away

348
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:01,659
There they go

349
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:05,995
Cheer up, Charlie

350
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:09,667
Give me a smile

351
00:23:10,272 --> 00:23:14,675
What happened
to that smile I used to know

352
00:23:16,945 --> 00:23:19,072
Don't you know your grin

353
00:23:19,281 --> 00:23:22,682
Has always been my sunshine

354
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:27,178
Let that sunshine show

355
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:32,288
Come on, Charlie

356
00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:36,461
No need to frown

357
00:23:37,032 --> 00:23:38,693
Deep down you know

358
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:41,696
The world is still your toy

359
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:46,132
When the world gets heavy

360
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:49,040
Never pit-a-pat 'em

361
00:23:50,378 --> 00:23:53,370
Up and at 'em, boy

362
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:58,146
Some day...

363
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:01,045
...sweet as a song

364
00:24:02,057 --> 00:24:06,050
Charlie's lucky day will come along

365
00:24:08,663 --> 00:24:13,327
Till that day
you've got to stay strong, Charlie

366
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:19,897
Up on top is right where you belong

367
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:25,910
Look up, Charlie

368
00:24:26,348 --> 00:24:29,317
You'll see a star

369
00:24:29,518 --> 00:24:31,008
Just follow it

370
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:35,412
And keep your dream in view

371
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:41,255
Pretty soon the sky
is going to clear up, Charlie

372
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:48,092
Cheer up, Charlie, do

373
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:53,367
Cheer up, Charlie

374
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:58,543
Just be glad you're you

375
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:10,284
While the world searches...

376
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,220
...here it has actually happened.

377
00:25:12,794 --> 00:25:16,696
There's only one Golden Ticket
left in the entire world.

378
00:25:16,898 --> 00:25:20,356
Because right here,
in Marble Falls, Arizona...

379
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:22,366
...is lucky winner number four!

380
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:26,371
The name to be heard around
the universe is Mr. Mike Teevee!

381
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:28,374
Can we shut that off?

382
00:25:28,577 --> 00:25:31,375
- Are you crazy?
- He won't answer till station break.

383
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,605
The country wants to hear from you!

384
00:25:33,815 --> 00:25:35,942
Can't you shut up?
I'm busy.

385
00:25:36,151 --> 00:25:37,277
What a show!

386
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:39,282
I serve all his dinners here.

387
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:40,954
He's never been to the table.

388
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:42,955
- You love TV?
- You bet!

389
00:25:43,158 --> 00:25:44,785
About that Golden ticket...

390
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:46,392
I want to catch this!

391
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:49,564
- Like killings?
- What do you think life's all about?

392
00:25:49,764 --> 00:25:51,493
Mike, would you tell us if...

393
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:54,635
Wait till I get a real one.

394
00:25:54,836 --> 00:25:55,928
Colt 45.

395
00:25:56,171 --> 00:25:58,401
Pop won't let me have one yet, will you?

396
00:25:58,607 --> 00:26:00,598
Not till you're 12, son.

397
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:08,980
Four down, one to go.

398
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:13,314
And somewhere out there another
lucky person is moving closer...

399
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:18,288
...to finding the last of the most
sought-after prizes in history.

400
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:21,421
Though we can envy him,
whoever he is...

401
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,599
...and might be tempted
to be bitter at our losing...

402
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,768
...we must remember there are
more important things.

403
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:30,460
Many more important things!

404
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:34,536
Offhand, I can't think of what they are
but I'm sure there's something.

405
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:36,299
Now for weather and...

406
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:41,880
Why did you wake me up?
Is something wrong?

407
00:26:47,822 --> 00:26:49,983
Grandpa!
That money was for tobacco.

408
00:26:50,258 --> 00:26:52,351
I've told you, I've given it up.

409
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:53,958
Go on, open it!

410
00:26:54,162 --> 00:26:56,187
One ticket left.
Let's see that gold.

411
00:26:56,398 --> 00:26:58,730
No, you do it. I can't.

412
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:02,029
We're going to be lucky this time.

413
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:04,671
I've got a funny feeling inside.

414
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:08,840
Which end shall I open first?

415
00:27:10,011 --> 00:27:12,070
That end. Just a tiny bit.

416
00:27:13,848 --> 00:27:16,408
- Like this?
- Now a bit more.

417
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:20,520
- You finish it! I can't.
- No, Grandpa! You do it.

418
00:27:21,022 --> 00:27:22,353
All right.

419
00:27:22,691 --> 00:27:24,181
Here goes.

420
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,592
You know...

421
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,593
...I bet those Golden Tickets
make the chocolate taste terrible.

422
00:27:46,881 --> 00:27:48,940
Lot 403.

423
00:27:49,217 --> 00:27:51,583
I can personally guarantee...

424
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,517
...that this is the absolutely
last case of Wonka Bars...

425
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:57,248
...left in the United Kingdom.

426
00:27:57,459 --> 00:28:01,225
Shall we start the bidding at
1,000 pounds? Do I hear 1,000?

427
00:28:01,996 --> 00:28:03,190
1,500 pounds?

428
00:28:03,398 --> 00:28:04,797
2,000?

429
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:06,227
I have 2,500.

430
00:28:06,468 --> 00:28:07,230
4,000?

431
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:09,436
4,500 pounds?

432
00:28:09,637 --> 00:28:11,264
5,000?

433
00:28:11,473 --> 00:28:13,134
Your Majesty!

434
00:28:16,644 --> 00:28:18,373
I'm sorry, Mrs. Curtis.

435
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,775
There isn't anything to give us a clue.

436
00:28:20,982 --> 00:28:23,041
They kidnapped my husband
12 hours ago.

437
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:25,276
When will we hear?
What do they want?

438
00:28:25,487 --> 00:28:29,150
Stay calm. They want ransom.
We wait to hear their demands.

439
00:28:29,657 --> 00:28:31,887
I'll give them anything they want.

440
00:28:32,093 --> 00:28:33,924
All I want is Harold back!

441
00:28:39,334 --> 00:28:40,767
Go ahead, we're listening.

442
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:49,001
Whatever they asked for
they can have it.

443
00:28:49,944 --> 00:28:52,435
They want your case of Wonka Bars.

444
00:28:57,685 --> 00:28:59,346
Did you hear me?

445
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:03,123
It's your husband's life
or your Wonka Bars.

446
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:06,452
How long do I have to think it over?

447
00:29:08,196 --> 00:29:09,163
That's it!

448
00:29:09,364 --> 00:29:11,832
The Wonka contest is all over.

449
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:14,092
The final ticket has been found...

450
00:29:14,302 --> 00:29:18,705
...we've got a live report in from
Paraguay, South America.

451
00:29:18,873 --> 00:29:21,341
It is finished.
The end has come.

452
00:29:21,543 --> 00:29:24,273
The last Golden Ticket has been found...

453
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:25,844
...right here in Paraguay.

454
00:29:26,047 --> 00:29:29,016
The finder is lucky Alberto Minoleta...

455
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:33,017
...the millionaire owner
of South America gambling casinos.

456
00:29:33,221 --> 00:29:36,679
Here is the most recent picture
of the happy finder.

457
00:29:38,126 --> 00:29:39,457
Turn it off!

458
00:29:40,895 --> 00:29:42,863
Well, that's that.

459
00:29:43,064 --> 00:29:44,622
No more Golden Tickets.

460
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,858
A lot of rubbish, the whole thing.

461
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:48,501
Not to Charlie, it wasn't.

462
00:29:48,736 --> 00:29:53,537
A boy needs something to hope for.
What's he got to hope for now?

463
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:55,834
Who's going to tell him?

464
00:29:56,077 --> 00:29:58,978
Let's not wake him.
He'll find out soon enough.

465
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,647
Yeah, let him sleep.

466
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:03,249
Let him have one last dream.

467
00:30:11,025 --> 00:30:13,823
I've decided to switch
Friday's schedule to Monday.

468
00:30:14,028 --> 00:30:17,657
Which means Friday's test
on what we learned during the week...

469
00:30:17,866 --> 00:30:20,164
...will now be Monday
before we've learned it.

470
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:22,598
Since today's Tuesday,
it doesn't matter.

471
00:30:23,037 --> 00:30:24,766
Pencils ready!

472
00:30:26,374 --> 00:30:29,275
Today, we are going to learn about...

473
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:31,743
...percentages.

474
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:35,575
For example, let's take
the recent unpleasantness.

475
00:30:35,783 --> 00:30:38,843
Suppose there are
1,000 Wonka Bars in the world...

476
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:42,853
...and you each opened
a certain number of them.

477
00:30:43,057 --> 00:30:45,218
That number is...

478
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,221
...a percent. Understand?

479
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:52,156
Madeline Durkin, how many
Wonka Bars did you open?

480
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:53,792
About 100.

481
00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:59,095
There are ten 100's in 1,000,
therefore, you opened 10 percent.

482
00:30:59,574 --> 00:31:01,872
Peter Goff, how many did you open?

483
00:31:02,076 --> 00:31:03,304
150.

484
00:31:03,745 --> 00:31:08,546
10% half over again, which makes
15 percent. Charlie Bucket!

485
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,945
- How many did you open?
- Two.

486
00:31:11,152 --> 00:31:12,642
That's easy. 200 is twice...

487
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,354
Not 200.

488
00:31:15,924 --> 00:31:16,948
Just 2.

489
00:31:17,592 --> 00:31:20,322
What do you mean, you only opened 2?

490
00:31:20,828 --> 00:31:22,796
I don't care much for chocolate.

491
00:31:22,997 --> 00:31:24,897
I can't figure out just 2!

492
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:27,226
Let's pretend you opened 200.

493
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:31,735
If you opened 200 Wonka Bars,
apart from being dreadfully sick...

494
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,567
...you'd use 20% of 1,000...

495
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:36,676
...which is 15 percent half again,
10 percent...

496
00:32:26,394 --> 00:32:28,259
I'd like a bar of chocolate, please.

497
00:32:28,463 --> 00:32:29,589
Why, sure.

498
00:32:29,797 --> 00:32:30,855
What kind?

499
00:32:31,065 --> 00:32:34,034
A Slugworth Sizzler?
A Wonka Scrumdiddleumptious?

500
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:37,227
- Whichever's biggest.
- Try a Wonka Scrumdiddleumptious.

501
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:41,302
Now that the tickets are found,
I don't have to hide them.

502
00:32:54,255 --> 00:32:55,882
Take it easy!

503
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,251
You'll get a stomach ache.

504
00:32:58,593 --> 00:33:00,493
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye, now.

505
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:11,602
I think I'll buy just one more,
for my Grandpa Joe.

506
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:13,101
Sure.

507
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:16,075
Try a regular Wonka Bar.

508
00:33:16,277 --> 00:33:17,608
Fine.

509
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:33,653
- Take it easy! One at a time!
- Did you hear the news?

510
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:36,193
That gambler from Paraguay
made a phony ticket.

511
00:33:36,397 --> 00:33:39,525
There's one Golden Ticket
still floating around.

512
00:33:39,734 --> 00:33:42,669
The nerve of that guy!
Trying to fool the world!

513
00:33:43,504 --> 00:33:47,338
He was a crook! This means
the contest goes on forever.

514
00:34:31,285 --> 00:34:33,185
You got the last Golden Ticket!

515
00:34:33,387 --> 00:34:36,220
The kid's found the last Golden Ticket!

516
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:42,127
Stand back!
Leave the boy alone!

517
00:34:44,966 --> 00:34:46,297
Break it up!

518
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:49,535
Charlie! Hold onto that ticket!

519
00:34:49,737 --> 00:34:52,205
Run for it! Run straight home!

520
00:34:52,406 --> 00:34:54,465
Don't stop till you get there!

521
00:35:26,107 --> 00:35:27,734
I congratulate you.

522
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:29,170
Well done.

523
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:32,078
You've found the fifth Golden Ticket.

524
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,111
May I introduce myself?

525
00:35:34,348 --> 00:35:35,906
Arthur Slugworth.

526
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:38,677
President of Slugworth Chocolates.

527
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,422
Listen carefully, because
I'm going to make you very rich.

528
00:35:43,624 --> 00:35:47,355
Mr. Wonka is working on
a fantastic invention.

529
00:35:47,862 --> 00:35:50,126
The Everlasting Gobstopper.

530
00:35:50,798 --> 00:35:52,823
If he succeeds, he'll ruin me.

531
00:35:53,034 --> 00:35:56,333
I want you to get just one
Everlasting Gobstopper...

532
00:35:56,537 --> 00:35:59,870
...and bring it to me
so I can find the secret formula.

533
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:01,505
Your reward will be...

534
00:36:01,709 --> 00:36:03,768
...10,000 of these.

535
00:36:03,978 --> 00:36:05,639
Think it over, will you?

536
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,848
A new house for your family...

537
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:11,314
...food and comfort
for the rest of their lives.

538
00:36:12,153 --> 00:36:13,950
And don't forget the name...

539
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:16,385
...Everlasting Gobstopper.

540
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:48,916
I've got it!
The fifth Golden Ticket is mine!

541
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,817
You're pulling our legs, Charlie.

542
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:54,824
There aren't any more Golden Tickets.

543
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:57,395
The last one's fake!
It's in the paper!

544
00:36:57,598 --> 00:37:01,159
I found money, bought a Wonka Bar
and the ticket was in it!

545
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:03,701
Look at it! See for yourself!

546
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:06,706
Read it, Joe, for heaven's sake!

547
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:11,575
"Greetings to you, the lucky finder
of this Golden Ticket...

548
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:15,738
"...from Mr. Willy Wonka. Present
this ticket at the factory gates...

549
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:20,182
"...at 10 o'clock in the morning,
October 1st, and do not be late!"

550
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:25,189
"You may bring with you one member
of your own family, but no one else.

551
00:37:25,393 --> 00:37:28,521
"In your wildest dreams
you could not imagine...

552
00:37:28,729 --> 00:37:31,755
"...the marvelous surprises
that await you!"

553
00:37:31,966 --> 00:37:32,898
You've done it!

554
00:37:35,403 --> 00:37:38,031
It says I can take somebody with me.

555
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:39,900
I wish you could go.

556
00:37:50,418 --> 00:37:51,578
Charlie!

557
00:37:58,426 --> 00:38:00,223
That's good, Charlie.

558
00:38:00,428 --> 00:38:01,986
Now help me up.

559
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:16,569
Are you okay?

560
00:38:16,777 --> 00:38:18,836
I'm fine, Charlie.

561
00:38:28,856 --> 00:38:30,346
Watch it, Joe!

562
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:41,023
Look at me!

563
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:45,869
Look at me!

564
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,531
Up and about!

565
00:38:50,144 --> 00:38:53,477
I haven't done this in 20 years!

566
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:03,354
I never thought my life could be

567
00:39:05,026 --> 00:39:08,359
Anything but catastrophe

568
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:12,689
But suddenly I begin to see

569
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:16,697
A bit of good luck for me

570
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,703
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket

571
00:39:24,712 --> 00:39:27,704
I've got a golden twinkle...

572
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,041
...in my eye

573
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:37,616
I never had a chance to shine

574
00:39:37,825 --> 00:39:39,850
Never a happy song to sing

575
00:39:40,061 --> 00:39:42,029
But suddenly half the world is mine

576
00:39:42,229 --> 00:39:43,787
What an amazing thing

577
00:39:43,998 --> 00:39:45,863
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket

578
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:47,557
It's ours, Charlie!

579
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:51,402
I've got a golden sun up in the sky

580
00:39:51,906 --> 00:39:53,567
Slippers, Charlie!

581
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:59,309
I never thought I'd see the day
When I would face the world and say

582
00:39:59,613 --> 00:40:02,446
Good morning
Look at the sun

583
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:06,811
I never thought that I would be
Slap in the lap of luxury

584
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:08,579
'Cause I'd have said

585
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:10,313
It couldn't be done

586
00:40:10,524 --> 00:40:12,287
But it can be done

587
00:40:13,861 --> 00:40:15,852
The cane, Charlie!

588
00:40:20,634 --> 00:40:22,192
Here I go!

589
00:40:23,137 --> 00:40:24,968
Watch my speed!

590
00:40:31,545 --> 00:40:35,106
I never dreamed that I would climb
Over the moon in ecstasy

591
00:40:35,316 --> 00:40:39,343
But nevertheless it's there that I'm
Shortly about to be

592
00:40:39,553 --> 00:40:40,986
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket

593
00:40:42,556 --> 00:40:46,356
I've got a golden chance to make my way

594
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,553
And with a Golden Ticket
It's a golden day

595
00:41:07,915 --> 00:41:10,907
Good morning! Look at the sun!

596
00:41:15,356 --> 00:41:19,087
'Cause I'd have said
It couldn't be done

597
00:41:19,426 --> 00:41:21,587
But it can be done

598
00:41:22,763 --> 00:41:26,665
I never dreamed that I would climb
Over the moon in ecstasy

599
00:41:26,867 --> 00:41:30,735
But, nevertheless, it's there that I'm
Shortly about to be

600
00:41:30,938 --> 00:41:33,429
'Cause I've got a Golden Ticket

601
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:35,674
I've got a Golden Ticket

602
00:41:35,876 --> 00:41:39,505
I've got a golden chance to make my way

603
00:41:39,713 --> 00:41:43,706
And with a Golden Ticket
It's a golden day

604
00:41:48,556 --> 00:41:51,923
Stop! It says the first of October.
That's tomorrow.

605
00:41:52,126 --> 00:41:56,187
We've got a lot to do! Comb your hair,
wash your face, polish your shoes...

606
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:59,423
- I'll take care of everything.
- We don't have much time.

607
00:41:59,633 --> 00:42:03,626
Grandpa... on the way home today,
I ran into Mr. Slugworth.

608
00:42:28,495 --> 00:42:30,224
Hey, Mom, we're on TV!

609
00:42:30,431 --> 00:42:32,399
Hi, everybody in Marble Falls!

610
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,228
Hi, Billy! Hi, Maggie! Hi, Fishface!

611
00:42:35,436 --> 00:42:36,300
How do I look?

612
00:42:36,503 --> 00:42:37,970
- You guys ready?
- You're on.

613
00:42:38,172 --> 00:42:39,799
This is the big day.

614
00:42:40,007 --> 00:42:44,910
The day Willy Wonka will open his gates
and shower gifts on the 5 lucky winners.

615
00:42:45,112 --> 00:42:48,411
From over the globe, people have
gathered, waiting for the hour...

616
00:42:48,616 --> 00:42:51,847
...to see that legendary magician,
Mr. Willy Wonka.

617
00:42:54,355 --> 00:42:57,813
Hi, friends! Don't forget
to visit Beauregarde's Auto Mart...

618
00:42:58,025 --> 00:43:00,926
Cut it out, Dad!
This is my show!

619
00:43:01,128 --> 00:43:04,962
Hi, Cornelia! I've still got it.
How's this for a stretch?

620
00:43:18,145 --> 00:43:20,443
I want to go in first, before anybody.

621
00:43:20,648 --> 00:43:22,479
Anything you say.

622
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:29,155
Save some room for later,
Augustus liebling.

623
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:35,790
I don't believe it! We did it.
We're actually going in.

624
00:43:35,996 --> 00:43:39,727
To see the greatest of them all,
Mr. Willy Wonka!

625
00:45:24,671 --> 00:45:26,002
Thank you.

626
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:28,235
Welcome, my friends.

627
00:45:28,509 --> 00:45:30,534
Welcome to my chocolate factory.

628
00:45:31,178 --> 00:45:32,440
Would you come forward?

629
00:45:33,614 --> 00:45:35,741
Get back!
Come on, Veruca!

630
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:44,089
That's Slugworth,
the man I told you about.

631
00:45:48,762 --> 00:45:51,595
Welcome.
It's nice to have you here.

632
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,398
I'm so glad you could come.

633
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,502
This is going to be such an
exciting day. I hope you enjoy it.

634
00:45:57,938 --> 00:45:59,428
I think you will.

635
00:45:59,773 --> 00:46:01,866
Please show me your Golden tickets.

636
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,409
I'm Veruca Salt.

637
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:06,738
Dear Veruca, what a pleasure!

638
00:46:06,947 --> 00:46:09,074
You look pretty in that mink coat!

639
00:46:09,283 --> 00:46:10,944
I've got three others.

640
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,352
Overjoyed to see you, sir.
Would you just step over there?

641
00:46:15,622 --> 00:46:16,589
Augustus Gloop.

642
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:18,758
Augustus, my dear boy!

643
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:21,587
Good to see you, and in such fine shape!

644
00:46:21,795 --> 00:46:25,663
This must be the radiant Mrs. Gloop.
Over there, dear lady.

645
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,994
- Violet Beauregarde.
- Darling child! Welcome to Wonka's.

646
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,670
What kind of gum you got?

647
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,133
Charming!

648
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:33,936
Sam Beauregarde here!

649
00:46:34,141 --> 00:46:35,665
What a genuine pleasure.

650
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:39,107
Any automotive needs, call.
Phone number's on the card.

651
00:46:39,313 --> 00:46:41,372
"With Sam B., it's a guarantee!"

652
00:46:42,316 --> 00:46:44,011
I'm Mike Teevee.

653
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,685
Wham, you're dead!

654
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,183
Wonderful to meet you!

655
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,184
Mrs. Teevee, how do you do?

656
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:52,051
- What an adorable boy you have.
- Thank you.

657
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:53,522
Charlie Bucket.

658
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:58,187
I read all about you in the papers.
I'm so happy for you. And who's this?

659
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,956
My grandfather, Grandpa Joe.

660
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:01,099
Delighted.

661
00:47:01,335 --> 00:47:03,462
Overjoyed. Enraptured. Entranced.

662
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:05,160
Are we ready?
Yes! Good!

663
00:47:05,506 --> 00:47:06,837
In with you!

664
00:47:42,175 --> 00:47:44,507
Hats, coats, galoshes over here.

665
00:47:44,678 --> 00:47:47,738
Hurry, we have so much time
and so little to see.

666
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,916
Wait a minute! Strike that.

667
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,449
Reverse it. Thank you.

668
00:47:54,354 --> 00:47:57,653
- When do I get my chocolate?
- First take off your coat, Violet.

669
00:47:57,858 --> 00:47:59,291
Boy, what weird coat hangers!

670
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:06,365
Surprises around every corner, but
nothing dangerous! Don't be alarmed.

671
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:09,261
As soon as your outer vestments
are in hand...

672
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,800
...we'll begin.

673
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,335
Now...

674
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:15,531
...will the children
kindly step up here.

675
00:48:26,587 --> 00:48:28,646
Accidents? What kind of accidents?

676
00:48:28,922 --> 00:48:31,390
I didn't know we had to sign anything.

677
00:48:31,592 --> 00:48:33,150
I can't read the bottom.

678
00:48:33,694 --> 00:48:35,559
Violet, you first.

679
00:48:35,762 --> 00:48:36,888
Sign here.

680
00:48:37,097 --> 00:48:38,064
Hold it!

681
00:48:38,265 --> 00:48:40,495
Let me through.
Don't sign anything.

682
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:41,995
What's this about?

683
00:48:42,202 --> 00:48:43,829
Standard form of contract.

684
00:48:44,037 --> 00:48:47,666
Don't talk contracts, I use them myself.
They're for suckers.

685
00:48:47,874 --> 00:48:51,173
You wouldn't begrudge me
a little protection? A drop?

686
00:48:51,378 --> 00:48:52,709
I don't sign anything without my lawyer.

687
00:48:52,946 --> 00:48:55,676
- Veruca don't sign anything either!
- Then she don't go in.

688
00:48:55,949 --> 00:48:57,507
I'm sorry. House rules.

689
00:48:57,718 --> 00:49:01,677
- I want to go in. Don't try to stop me!
- I'm only trying to help.

690
00:49:01,888 --> 00:49:06,291
Give me that pen!
You're always making things difficult.

691
00:49:07,127 --> 00:49:10,756
Nicely handled! She's a girl
who knows where she's going.

692
00:49:11,898 --> 00:49:13,729
What's all that small print?

693
00:49:14,401 --> 00:49:17,097
Any problems? Dial Information.
Thanks for calling.

694
00:49:20,674 --> 00:49:23,142
I assume there's
an accident indemnity clause?

695
00:49:23,343 --> 00:49:24,332
Never between friends.

696
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:28,108
Saw this in a movie. A guy signed
his wife's insurance policy.

697
00:49:28,515 --> 00:49:30,312
- Then he bumped her off.
- Clever.

698
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:31,382
What about me, Grandpa?

699
00:49:31,585 --> 00:49:33,985
Sign away, Charlie!
We've got nothing to lose.

700
00:49:34,187 --> 00:49:36,155
Let's go in! Come on!

701
00:49:36,356 --> 00:49:39,484
Patience.
Everything has to be in order.

702
00:49:39,693 --> 00:49:41,524
Everyone signed? Yes?

703
00:49:41,862 --> 00:49:43,352
Good. On we go!

704
00:49:52,873 --> 00:49:54,431
Ninety-nine...

705
00:49:54,775 --> 00:49:55,935
...forty-four...

706
00:49:56,276 --> 00:49:58,039
...one hundred percent pure.

707
00:49:59,713 --> 00:50:01,874
Just through the other door, please.

708
00:50:04,217 --> 00:50:06,048
There's some mistake here.

709
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,449
There is no other door.

710
00:50:08,722 --> 00:50:09,848
There's no way out!

711
00:50:10,057 --> 00:50:12,855
I know there's a door here someplace.

712
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,925
I don't like this, Wonka!

713
00:50:15,128 --> 00:50:16,425
Is this a trick?

714
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:18,530
Mr. Wonka, help!

715
00:50:18,732 --> 00:50:20,199
I'm getting squashed!
Save me!

716
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,766
Is it my soul that calls my name?

717
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:24,402
Let me out or I'll scream!

718
00:50:24,738 --> 00:50:27,104
- Somebody's touching me!
- Now look here, Wonka!

719
00:50:27,307 --> 00:50:31,903
Question time will come at the end
of the session. We must press on.

720
00:50:33,513 --> 00:50:35,140
- Here we are.
- Don't be a fool.

721
00:50:35,348 --> 00:50:36,781
That's the way we came in.

722
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,244
It is? Are you sure?

723
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,648
We've just come through there.

724
00:50:41,855 --> 00:50:43,345
How do you like that?

725
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:46,489
- There we are.
- What is this, Wonka?

726
00:50:46,693 --> 00:50:47,489
A funhouse?

727
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:49,588
Why? Having fun?

728
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,764
I'm not going in there.

729
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:53,592
We're getting out of here.

730
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,258
You can't get out backwards.
You have to go forward to go back.

731
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,961
Better press on.

732
00:50:59,873 --> 00:51:02,433
- The room is getting smaller.
- No, it's not!

733
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,872
- He's getting bigger.
- He's at it again.

734
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:08,008
- Where's the chocolate?
- I doubt if there is any.

735
00:51:08,215 --> 00:51:10,308
I doubt if any of us will get out alive.

736
00:51:10,851 --> 00:51:13,183
Never doubt what nobody is sure about.

737
00:51:13,386 --> 00:51:15,616
You can't squeeze me through that door.

738
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,290
You're off your nut.
No one can get through there.

739
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,857
My dear friends...

740
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,961
...you are now about to enter
the nerve center...

741
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,427
...to the entire Wonka factory.

742
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:30,463
Inside this room,
all of my dreams become realities.

743
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,695
And some of my realities become dreams.

744
00:51:32,906 --> 00:51:36,706
And almost everything you'll see
is eatable... edible.

745
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:38,901
I mean, you can eat almost everything.

746
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,703
Let me in, I'm starving!

747
00:51:40,914 --> 00:51:43,940
Don't get overexcited.
Don't lose your head.

748
00:51:44,151 --> 00:51:45,914
We wouldn't want to lose that.

749
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,147
Yet.

750
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,153
Now, the combination.

751
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,349
This is a musical lock.

752
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,056
Rachmaninoff.

753
00:51:57,264 --> 00:51:58,356
Ladies and gentlemen...

754
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:01,360
...boys and girls...

755
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,098
...the Chocolate Room.

756
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,107
Hold your breath. Make a wish.

757
00:52:45,145 --> 00:52:46,339
Count to three.

758
00:52:47,147 --> 00:52:48,614
Come with me

759
00:52:48,982 --> 00:52:50,779
And you'll be

760
00:52:50,984 --> 00:52:54,647
In a world of pure imagination

761
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,555
Take a look

762
00:52:56,756 --> 00:53:00,749
And you'll see into your imagination

763
00:53:08,168 --> 00:53:10,159
We'll begin

764
00:53:10,837 --> 00:53:12,202
With a spin

765
00:53:12,405 --> 00:53:16,102
Traveling in the world of my creation

766
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,272
What we'll see will defy

767
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:23,281
Explanation

768
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:37,286
If you want to view paradise

769
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,626
Simply look around and view it

770
00:53:42,402 --> 00:53:44,893
Anything you want to, do it

771
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,297
Want to change the world

772
00:53:50,076 --> 00:53:52,135
There's nothing to it

773
00:54:00,887 --> 00:54:01,717
Hurry, Violet!

774
00:54:01,922 --> 00:54:03,514
This way, Grandpa!

775
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:13,064
There is no life I know

776
00:54:13,266 --> 00:54:16,292
To compare with pure imagination

777
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,937
Living there
You'll be free

778
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:22,841
If you truly wish to be

779
00:55:04,851 --> 00:55:07,877
If you want to view paradise

780
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,550
Simply look around and view it

781
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:15,719
Anything you want to, do it

782
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,123
Want to change the world

783
00:55:19,332 --> 00:55:21,323
There's nothing...

784
00:55:22,002 --> 00:55:24,061
...to it

785
00:55:35,348 --> 00:55:38,408
There is no life I know

786
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:45,024
To compare with pure imagination

787
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,587
Living there

788
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:52,757
You'll be free

789
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:57,066
If you truly...

790
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:02,702
...wish to be

791
00:56:14,821 --> 00:56:16,584
What a disgusting, dirty river!

792
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,189
It's industrial waste.

793
00:56:18,391 --> 00:56:20,518
A ruined watershed, Wonka.
It's polluted.

794
00:56:20,727 --> 00:56:21,694
It's chocolate.

795
00:56:21,895 --> 00:56:23,192
That's chocolate?

796
00:56:23,396 --> 00:56:24,590
That's chocolate.

797
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,265
A chocolate river.

798
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,866
The most fantastic thing I've ever seen.

799
00:56:29,069 --> 00:56:30,730
10,000 gallons an hour.

800
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:34,736
Look at my waterfall.
That's the most important thing.

801
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:39,609
It's mixing my chocolate.
It's actually churning my chocolate.

802
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:43,579
No other factory in the world
mixes chocolate by waterfall.

803
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:47,214
But it's the only way
if you want it just right.

804
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,820
Grandpa, look over across the river!

805
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,123
Little men!

806
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,258
Jumping crocodiles, Charlie!

807
00:56:53,593 --> 00:56:55,424
Now we know who makes it.

808
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,825
I never saw anybody
with an orange face before.

809
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,566
Funny looking people.

810
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:03,463
What are they doing?

811
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,069
Creaming and sugaring time.

812
00:57:05,271 --> 00:57:08,331
- They can't be real people.
- Of course, they're real people.

813
00:57:08,608 --> 00:57:09,734
Nonsense!

814
00:57:09,943 --> 00:57:11,843
No, Oompa Loompas.

815
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:13,975
From Loompaland.

816
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,977
Loompaland?
There's no such place!

817
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,649
Excuse me, dear lady...

818
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,148
I teach geography.

819
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:20,751
Then you know all about it.

820
00:57:20,954 --> 00:57:22,478
And what a terrible country it is.

821
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,817
Nothing but desolate wastes
and fierce beasts.

822
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:29,085
The poor little Oompa Loompas
were so small and helpless...

823
00:57:29,295 --> 00:57:31,593
...they would get gobbled up.

824
00:57:31,998 --> 00:57:34,865
A Wangdoodle would eat
ten of them for breakfast.

825
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,033
And so I said...

826
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:40,168
"Come and live with me
in peace and safety...

827
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:43,274
"...away from all the Wangdoodles
and Hornswogglers...

828
00:57:43,476 --> 00:57:47,003
"...and Snozzwangers
and rotten Vermicious Knids."

829
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:51,172
Snozzwangers? Vermicious Knids?
What kind of rubbish is that?

830
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,875
I'm sorry, questions
must be submitted in writing.

831
00:57:54,154 --> 00:57:56,122
So, in the greatest of secrecy...

832
00:57:56,322 --> 00:57:59,849
...I transported the entire population
of Oompa Loompas here.

833
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:03,961
I want an Oompa Loompa.
I want you to get me one right away!

834
00:58:04,164 --> 00:58:06,655
All right, I'll get you one
before the day's out.

835
00:58:07,167 --> 00:58:09,533
I want an Oompa Loompa now!

836
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,067
Can it, you nit!

837
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,532
This is terrific.

838
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:17,073
- Grandpa, look at Augustus.
- Don't worry, he can't drink it all.

839
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:21,071
Augustus, sweetheart,
save some room for later.

840
00:58:21,347 --> 00:58:25,340
Don't do that! My chocolate
must never be touched by human hands.

841
00:58:26,186 --> 00:58:28,814
Don't do that!
You're contaminating my entire river!

842
00:58:29,022 --> 00:58:31,183
Please, I beg you!
Augustus!

843
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,718
My chocolate!

844
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,019
Help!

845
00:58:36,196 --> 00:58:38,426
My chocolate!
My beautiful chocolate!

846
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,231
Don't just stand there!
Do something!

847
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,528
Help. Police. Murder.

848
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,531
Grab this!

849
00:58:48,474 --> 00:58:50,101
What's happening to him?

850
00:58:50,376 --> 00:58:51,843
- Looks like he's drowning.
- Dive in!

851
00:58:52,045 --> 00:58:53,410
- Save him!
- It's too late.

852
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,012
- Too late?
- He's had it now.

853
00:58:55,215 --> 00:58:57,706
- The suction's got him.
- Augustus, come back!

854
00:58:58,218 --> 00:58:59,344
Where is he?

855
00:58:59,552 --> 00:59:00,610
Watch the pipe.

856
00:59:01,221 --> 00:59:03,382
How long is he going to stay down?

857
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,951
- He can't swim!
- No better time to learn.

858
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:08,186
His coat's going up the pipe!

859
00:59:08,394 --> 00:59:09,418
Call a plumber!

860
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,597
He's stuck in the pipe, isn't he?

861
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:13,129
It's his stomach.

862
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,734
- He's blocking the chocolate!
- What happens now?

863
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:21,569
The pressure will get him out.
It's building up behind the blockage.

864
00:59:22,408 --> 00:59:24,774
I wonder how long it's going to take?

865
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,037
The suspense is terrible.

866
00:59:27,247 --> 00:59:28,236
I hope it'll last.

867
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:33,114
He'll never get out.

868
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:34,445
Yes, he will.

869
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,885
Remember you once asked me
how a bullet comes out of a gun?

870
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:41,388
He'll be marshmallows in 5 seconds!

871
00:59:41,594 --> 00:59:44,495
- Impossible, dear lady! Unthinkable!
- Why?

872
00:59:45,265 --> 00:59:47,631
Because that pipe
goes to the Fudge Room.

873
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,165
You terrible man!

874
00:59:51,938 --> 00:59:54,566
Take Mrs. Gloop to the Fudge Room,
but look sharp...

875
00:59:54,774 --> 00:59:56,969
...or her boy will get in the boiler.

876
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,905
You boiled him up!

877
00:59:59,112 --> 01:00:02,741
Nil desperandum. Across the desert
lies the promised land.

878
01:00:02,949 --> 01:00:04,314
Goodbye, Mrs. Gloop.

879
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:09,011
Adieu! Auf wiedersehen.
Gesundheit. Farewell.

880
01:00:10,456 --> 01:00:12,754
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do

881
01:00:12,959 --> 01:00:16,019
I've got a perfect puzzle for you

882
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,887
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Dee

883
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:22,660
If you are wise you'll listen to me

884
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,861
What do you get
when you guzzle down sweets?

885
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:29,197
Eating as much as an elephant eats

886
01:00:29,475 --> 01:00:32,444
What are you at getting terribly fat?

887
01:00:32,645 --> 01:00:37,048
What do you think will come of that?

888
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,211
I don't like the look of it

889
01:00:39,419 --> 01:00:42,217
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da

890
01:00:42,655 --> 01:00:45,556
If you're not greedy,
you will go far

891
01:00:45,792 --> 01:00:48,727
You will live in happiness too

892
01:00:49,128 --> 01:00:52,723
Like the Oompa Loompa
Doompa Dee Do

893
01:01:02,675 --> 01:01:05,235
What kind of place you running here?

894
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:10,681
What's he talking about?

895
01:01:30,036 --> 01:01:31,333
Wow, what a boat!

896
01:01:31,537 --> 01:01:33,528
Looks good enough to eat!

897
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,166
That's a nice little canoe.

898
01:01:36,376 --> 01:01:40,403
"All I ask is a tall ship
and a star to sail her by."

899
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:41,671
All aboard!

900
01:01:41,881 --> 01:01:43,906
Ladies first.
That means Veruca.

901
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:47,086
If she's a lady,
I'm a Vermicious Knid.

902
01:01:47,286 --> 01:01:50,847
- You sure this thing will float?
- With your buoyancy, rest assured.

903
01:01:51,057 --> 01:01:53,252
She's <i>trs jolie</i>,
but is she seaworthy?

904
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:57,020
Nothing to worry about.
I take good care of my guests.

905
01:01:57,230 --> 01:02:01,132
- You took good care of that August kid.
- Everybody aboard!

906
01:02:02,568 --> 01:02:04,433
You're going to love this.

907
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:05,968
Just love it.

908
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:40,461
I want a boat like this. A beautiful
paddle boat, that's what I want.

909
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:43,267
What she wants is a kick in the pants.

910
01:02:43,609 --> 01:02:44,906
I'm going to be seasick.

911
01:02:45,111 --> 01:02:46,578
- Try one of these.
- What are they?

912
01:02:46,779 --> 01:02:49,407
Rainbow drops.
You can spit in 7 colors.

913
01:02:49,615 --> 01:02:51,082
Spitting's a dirty habit.

914
01:02:51,284 --> 01:02:52,842
I know a worse one.

915
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:07,463
- What business are you in?
- Nuts.

916
01:03:19,812 --> 01:03:20,710
Where are we going?

917
01:03:21,147 --> 01:03:22,910
I don't like that tunnel.

918
01:03:23,115 --> 01:03:24,412
I want off!

919
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:29,553
Around the world and home again.
That's the sailor's way!

920
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,555
I don't like this ride, Daddy!

921
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:38,359
We're going too fast!

922
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:40,031
We're going to sink!

923
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,360
- Why doesn't he stop the boat?!
- Faster!

924
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,729
Close your eyes and hang on tight!

925
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:51,740
- What is this, a freak-out?!
- This isn't funny!

926
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:54,372
You can't possibly see
where you're going!

927
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,514
You're right. I can't.

928
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:58,683
This would make a great series!

929
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:05,023
- This is kind of strange.
- Yes, strange, Charlie. But it's fun!

930
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,924
I want to get off the boat, Wonka!

931
01:04:11,197 --> 01:04:12,164
I may get sick!

932
01:04:12,365 --> 01:04:13,832
This is going too far!

933
01:04:14,033 --> 01:04:16,695
Tell that little guy to turn us around!

934
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:18,701
Now I am going to be sick!

935
01:04:26,712 --> 01:04:30,273
There's no earthly way of knowing

936
01:04:31,551 --> 01:04:34,543
Which direction we are going

937
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:38,955
There's no knowing where we're rowing

938
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:42,551
Or which way the river's flowing

939
01:04:43,062 --> 01:04:45,087
Is it raining

940
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,698
Is it snowing

941
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:51,893
Is a hurricane a-blowing

942
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:57,405
Not a speck of light is showing,
so the danger must be growing!

943
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,468
Are the fires of hell a-blowing?

944
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,942
Is the grizzly reaper mowing?

945
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,447
Yes!

946
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:10,281
The danger must be growing
for the rowers keep on rowing!

947
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:13,481
And they're certainly not showing...

948
01:05:13,793 --> 01:05:17,661
...any signs that they are slowing!

949
01:05:22,435 --> 01:05:24,562
Make him stop, Daddy!

950
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:26,795
- This has gone far enough!
- Quite right, sir.

951
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:28,200
Stop the boat!

952
01:05:29,942 --> 01:05:31,637
- We're there.
- Where?

953
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:32,742
Here.

954
01:05:32,945 --> 01:05:36,608
A small step for mankind,
but a giant step for us.

955
01:05:36,949 --> 01:05:38,416
All ashore!

956
01:05:38,618 --> 01:05:40,586
Let me off this freight!

957
01:05:40,786 --> 01:05:43,812
- Why don't they show that stuff on TV?
- I don't know.

958
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,081
What a nightmare!

959
01:05:45,291 --> 01:05:47,919
Daddy, I do not want a boat like this.

960
01:05:48,127 --> 01:05:48,991
"Dairy cream."

961
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,093
"Whipped cream."

962
01:05:50,296 --> 01:05:52,127
- "Coffee cream."
- "Vanilla cream."

963
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:54,727
"Hair cream?"

964
01:05:58,004 --> 01:05:59,198
That's not French.

965
01:06:05,978 --> 01:06:07,468
I can't take much more.

966
01:06:10,149 --> 01:06:12,515
The Inventing Room.

967
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:15,680
Now remember, no messing about.

968
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:18,618
No touching, no tasting, no telling.

969
01:06:18,824 --> 01:06:19,688
No telling what?

970
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:24,158
All of my most secret inventions
are cooking and simmering in here.

971
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:28,294
Old Slugworth would give his false teeth
to get inside for five minutes.

972
01:06:28,501 --> 01:06:31,231
So don't touch a thing!

973
01:06:56,629 --> 01:06:57,425
Inventing room?

974
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:59,530
Looks more like a Turkish bath.

975
01:06:59,732 --> 01:07:03,190
Even if Slugworth did get in here,
he couldn't find anything.

976
01:07:03,402 --> 01:07:05,870
- You got a garbage strike?
- Who does cleaning?

977
01:07:06,072 --> 01:07:07,437
Shouldn't you wear gloves?

978
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,767
You'll have health inspectors after you.

979
01:07:09,975 --> 01:07:13,775
Invention, my dear friends,
is 93% perspiration...

980
01:07:13,979 --> 01:07:16,038
...6% electricity...

981
01:07:16,248 --> 01:07:18,045
...4% evaporation...

982
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,548
...and 2% butterscotch ripple.

983
01:07:20,753 --> 01:07:22,948
That's one hundred and five percent!

984
01:07:23,155 --> 01:07:24,417
Any good?

985
01:07:25,858 --> 01:07:26,916
Yes.

986
01:07:27,326 --> 01:07:28,759
Excuse me.

987
01:07:31,163 --> 01:07:34,599
Time is a precious thing.
Never waste it.

988
01:07:36,435 --> 01:07:40,166
- He's absolutely bonkers!
- That's not bad.

989
01:07:42,675 --> 01:07:45,906
In springtime
The only pretty ring time

990
01:07:46,112 --> 01:07:49,138
Birds sing
Hey, ding a ding-a-ding

991
01:07:49,348 --> 01:07:51,748
Sweet lovers love...

992
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:53,345
...the spring

993
01:07:56,422 --> 01:07:58,481
I told you not to, silly boy.

994
01:07:58,691 --> 01:07:59,988
Your teeth!

995
01:08:00,192 --> 01:08:01,784
Boy, that's great stuff.

996
01:08:02,128 --> 01:08:05,655
That's exploding candy,
for your enemies. Great idea.

997
01:08:05,865 --> 01:08:08,459
Not ready yet.
Needs more gel ignite.

998
01:08:18,644 --> 01:08:19,941
What's that for?

999
01:08:20,146 --> 01:08:21,636
Gives it a little kick.

1000
01:08:24,316 --> 01:08:25,476
Wonka!

1001
01:08:27,486 --> 01:08:29,716
Butterscotch? Buttergin?

1002
01:08:29,989 --> 01:08:31,786
Something going on inside?

1003
01:08:31,991 --> 01:08:34,892
"Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker."

1004
01:08:38,564 --> 01:08:40,964
What's the matter?
Too hot, Mr. Wonka?

1005
01:08:41,167 --> 01:08:43,192
Too cold! Far too cold.

1006
01:08:43,402 --> 01:08:45,734
That's gourmet cooking for you.

1007
01:08:46,572 --> 01:08:48,631
No! Don't, please.

1008
01:08:48,974 --> 01:08:51,738
Forgive me, but no one
must look under there.

1009
01:08:52,011 --> 01:08:54,878
This is the most secret machine
in my factory.

1010
01:08:55,247 --> 01:08:58,739
- This one's going to sizzle Slugworth.
- What's it do?

1011
01:09:00,352 --> 01:09:02,513
- Would you like to see?
- Yeah!

1012
01:09:26,045 --> 01:09:27,171
What's it do?

1013
01:09:27,379 --> 01:09:30,348
Can't you see?
It makes Everlasting Gobstoppers.

1014
01:09:30,549 --> 01:09:32,244
Everlasting Gobstoppers?

1015
01:09:32,451 --> 01:09:35,579
For children with little pocket money.
You can suck them forever.

1016
01:09:35,788 --> 01:09:37,585
I want an Everlasting Gobstopper!

1017
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:38,757
- Me, too!
- And me!

1018
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:41,518
Fantastic. Revolutionize the industry.

1019
01:09:41,727 --> 01:09:45,356
You suck them and they'll
never get smaller. Never...

1020
01:09:45,564 --> 01:09:46,690
...I think.

1021
01:09:46,899 --> 01:09:48,924
- Few more tests.
- How do you make them?

1022
01:09:49,134 --> 01:09:52,695
I'm a trifle deaf in this ear.
Speak louder next time.

1023
01:09:52,905 --> 01:09:56,306
- Who wants an Everlasting Gobstopper?
- Me! Me! I do!

1024
01:09:57,309 --> 01:10:01,712
I can only give them to you if you
swear to keep them for yourselves.

1025
01:10:01,914 --> 01:10:05,907
And never show them
to another soul as long as you live.

1026
01:10:06,485 --> 01:10:07,213
Agreed?

1027
01:10:07,419 --> 01:10:08,386
Agreed!

1028
01:10:08,587 --> 01:10:12,045
Good. One for you,
and one for you, and one for you.

1029
01:10:12,258 --> 01:10:13,589
What about Charlie?

1030
01:10:13,926 --> 01:10:15,223
And one for Charlie.

1031
01:10:15,427 --> 01:10:17,793
Hey, she's got two!
I want another!

1032
01:10:17,997 --> 01:10:20,795
- Stop squawking, you twit!
- Everybody has one.

1033
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,492
And one is enough for anybody.
Now, come along.

1034
01:10:25,938 --> 01:10:27,633
If you'll follow me...

1035
01:10:27,907 --> 01:10:30,068
...I have something special to show you.

1036
01:10:30,276 --> 01:10:31,766
It's special, all right.

1037
01:10:32,278 --> 01:10:34,473
I only hope Veruca doesn't want one.

1038
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:35,806
What a contraption!

1039
01:10:36,015 --> 01:10:37,073
Isn't she scrumptious?

1040
01:10:37,283 --> 01:10:40,081
My revolutionary,
non-pollutionary mechanical wonder.

1041
01:10:41,086 --> 01:10:43,611
Button, button,
who's got the button?

1042
01:10:44,023 --> 01:10:45,513
It's over there.

1043
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:47,285
- Here?
- Yeah.

1044
01:11:03,375 --> 01:11:05,502
What you are witnessing, dear friends...

1045
01:11:05,711 --> 01:11:08,680
...is the most enormous miracle
of the Machine Age.

1046
01:11:08,881 --> 01:11:11,816
The creation of a confectionery giant!

1047
01:11:21,493 --> 01:11:22,892
- Finito!
- That's all?

1048
01:11:23,562 --> 01:11:25,553
Don't you know what this is?

1049
01:11:25,831 --> 01:11:27,526
- By gum, it's gum!
- Wrong!

1050
01:11:27,733 --> 01:11:30,861
It's the most fabulous,
sensational gum in the world!

1051
01:11:31,437 --> 01:11:32,802
What's so fab about it?

1052
01:11:33,005 --> 01:11:36,133
- This piece of gum is a 3-course dinner.
- Bull!

1053
01:11:36,342 --> 01:11:39,311
- Roast beef, but it's not right yet.
- I don't care!

1054
01:11:39,511 --> 01:11:41,638
I wouldn't do that.
I really wouldn't.

1055
01:11:41,847 --> 01:11:43,542
If it's gum, that's for me.

1056
01:11:43,749 --> 01:11:45,808
Violet, don't do anything stupid.

1057
01:11:46,018 --> 01:11:47,849
What's it taste like?

1058
01:11:48,187 --> 01:11:50,747
Madness! It's tomato soup!

1059
01:11:51,190 --> 01:11:53,920
It's creamy. I can feel it
running down my throat!

1060
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,827
Stop. Don't.

1061
01:11:56,028 --> 01:11:57,552
Why doesn't she listen?

1062
01:11:57,763 --> 01:12:00,323
Because, Charlie, she's a nitwit.

1063
01:12:00,699 --> 01:12:01,825
Great soup!

1064
01:12:02,034 --> 01:12:03,831
The second course is coming.

1065
01:12:04,036 --> 01:12:06,368
Roast beef and a baked potato!

1066
01:12:06,872 --> 01:12:08,601
With sour cream?

1067
01:12:10,109 --> 01:12:12,907
- What's for dessert?
- Dessert? Here it comes!

1068
01:12:13,112 --> 01:12:17,173
Blueberry pie and cream! It's
the most marvelous pie I've ever tasted!

1069
01:12:17,383 --> 01:12:19,851
- What's happening to your face?
- Cool it!

1070
01:12:20,052 --> 01:12:21,076
Let me finish.

1071
01:12:21,286 --> 01:12:22,913
You're face is turning blue!

1072
01:12:23,122 --> 01:12:26,250
- You're turning violet, Violet!
- What are you talking?

1073
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:28,688
I told you I hadn't got it right yet.

1074
01:12:28,894 --> 01:12:31,260
Look what it's done to my kid!

1075
01:12:31,463 --> 01:12:34,796
It always goes wrong when we
come to the desserts. Always.

1076
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:37,193
What are you doing!

1077
01:12:37,403 --> 01:12:39,371
- You're blowing up!
- I feel funny!

1078
01:12:39,571 --> 01:12:41,596
- I'm not surprised.
- What's happening?!

1079
01:12:41,807 --> 01:12:43,775
- You're like a balloon!
- Like a blueberry.

1080
01:12:43,976 --> 01:12:45,910
- Call a doctor!
- Stick her with a pin.

1081
01:12:46,245 --> 01:12:48,611
- She'll pop!
- It happens every time!

1082
01:12:48,814 --> 01:12:51,874
- They all become blueberries.
- You've done it this time!

1083
01:12:52,084 --> 01:12:53,608
I'll break you for this!

1084
01:12:53,819 --> 01:12:55,787
I'll get it right in the end.

1085
01:12:56,055 --> 01:12:56,783
Help!

1086
01:12:56,989 --> 01:12:59,457
We've got to let the air out of her!

1087
01:12:59,691 --> 01:13:00,885
There's no air.

1088
01:13:01,093 --> 01:13:02,617
- That's juice.
- Juice?

1089
01:13:02,828 --> 01:13:05,956
Would you roll her down
to the juicing room?

1090
01:13:06,165 --> 01:13:08,224
- What for?
- For squeezing.

1091
01:13:08,434 --> 01:13:10,800
She has to be squeezed
before she explodes.

1092
01:13:11,003 --> 01:13:13,403
- Explodes?!
- It's a fairly simple operation.

1093
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,308
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do

1094
01:13:17,509 --> 01:13:20,967
I've got another puzzle for you

1095
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:24,343
Oompa Loompa Doompa Da Dee

1096
01:13:24,950 --> 01:13:28,408
If you are wise you'll listen to me

1097
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:31,680
Gum chewing's fine
When it's once in a while

1098
01:13:31,957 --> 01:13:35,586
It stops you from smoking
And brightens your smile

1099
01:13:35,794 --> 01:13:39,093
But it's repulsive
Revolting and wrong

1100
01:13:39,298 --> 01:13:41,163
Chewing and chewing

1101
01:13:41,366 --> 01:13:43,459
All day long

1102
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:46,961
The way that a cow does

1103
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:51,202
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da

1104
01:13:52,211 --> 01:13:55,203
Given good manners
You will go far

1105
01:13:55,881 --> 01:13:58,543
You will live in happiness too

1106
01:13:59,384 --> 01:14:02,842
Like the Oompa Loompa
Doompa Dee Do

1107
01:14:07,826 --> 01:14:11,193
I'll get even with you for this,
if it's the last thing I do!

1108
01:14:11,396 --> 01:14:13,990
I got a blueberry for a daughter!

1109
01:14:14,933 --> 01:14:18,733
"Where is fancy bred?
In the heart or in the head?"

1110
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:21,729
Shall we roll on?

1111
01:14:26,011 --> 01:14:27,342
Thank you.

1112
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:32,640
Well, well, well!
Two naughty, nasty little children gone.

1113
01:14:33,185 --> 01:14:36,586
Three good, sweet little children left.

1114
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:41,523
Hurry, please.
Long way to go yet.

1115
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:47,157
Wait a minute.
Must show you this.

1116
01:14:47,366 --> 01:14:49,994
Lickable wallpaper for nursery walls.

1117
01:14:50,202 --> 01:14:54,730
Lick an orange or pineapple.
It tastes like them. Try it!

1118
01:14:56,408 --> 01:14:58,376
I got a plum!

1119
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:02,013
Grandpa, this banana's fantastic!
It tastes so real!

1120
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:05,341
Try some more. The strawberries
taste like strawberries.

1121
01:15:05,551 --> 01:15:07,917
The snozzberries
taste like snozzberries.

1122
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:11,283
Snozzberries?
Whoever heard of a snozzberry?

1123
01:15:12,357 --> 01:15:14,757
We are the music makers.

1124
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:18,392
And we are the dreamers of dreams.

1125
01:15:19,531 --> 01:15:20,998
Come along.

1126
01:15:24,036 --> 01:15:26,869
Something very unusual in here.

1127
01:15:27,206 --> 01:15:30,505
Bubbles, bubbles everywhere,
but not a drop to drink.

1128
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:31,505
Yet.

1129
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:33,177
What's it making?

1130
01:15:33,378 --> 01:15:38,042
Fizzy-Lifting drinks. They fill you
with gas and the gas lifts you...

1131
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:40,684
...off the ground like a balloon.

1132
01:15:40,886 --> 01:15:42,478
Isn't it high?

1133
01:15:43,055 --> 01:15:44,579
But it's still too powerful.

1134
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:45,984
Let us try some!

1135
01:15:46,725 --> 01:15:51,094
No, no. There'd be children
floating all over the place!

1136
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:53,230
Come along, don't hang about.

1137
01:15:53,899 --> 01:15:56,299
You'll be wild about this next one.

1138
01:15:57,536 --> 01:15:59,936
Let's take a drink.
No one's watching.

1139
01:16:00,138 --> 01:16:01,901
A small one won't hurt us.

1140
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:08,745
Not bad.

1141
01:16:10,916 --> 01:16:12,144
Well?

1142
01:16:12,417 --> 01:16:13,975
Nothing's happening.

1143
01:16:14,253 --> 01:16:17,450
You're right, Charlie.
I can't understand why...!

1144
01:16:19,925 --> 01:16:21,517
I feel terribly strange.

1145
01:16:21,727 --> 01:16:24,594
- What do we do now?
- I don't know, Charlie...!

1146
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:29,562
- Mr. Wonka isn't going to like this!
- We can't stay up here all day!

1147
01:16:29,768 --> 01:16:31,565
- You're right, but...
- I'll try and get down.

1148
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:34,762
All right, Charlie,
but, please, be careful.

1149
01:16:35,774 --> 01:16:39,642
It's fun! It works!
Come on in! The air's fine!

1150
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:42,814
- I haven't swam in 20 years.
- Give me your hand!

1151
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:44,949
I don't think I ought to.

1152
01:16:47,619 --> 01:16:49,519
This is great!

1153
01:16:49,955 --> 01:16:51,354
Try this, Grandpa!

1154
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:53,954
All right, Charlie.
Wait for me!

1155
01:16:57,796 --> 01:17:00,663
- I'm a shooting star!
- I'm a rocket!

1156
01:17:02,134 --> 01:17:03,999
This is really great!

1157
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:06,227
Look, I'm a bird!

1158
01:17:08,307 --> 01:17:10,468
I feel light as a feather.

1159
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:12,470
Look down.

1160
01:17:12,678 --> 01:17:14,543
We're really high now.

1161
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:20,378
Watch this, Grandpa.

1162
01:17:23,989 --> 01:17:25,456
Wonderful, Charlie!

1163
01:17:25,657 --> 01:17:27,852
- Try it, Grandpa!
- I don't know!

1164
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,527
Come on, Grandpa!

1165
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:31,218
All right.

1166
01:17:33,565 --> 01:17:35,726
Hey, you did it, Grandpa!

1167
01:17:37,169 --> 01:17:38,966
I hit an air pocket.

1168
01:17:39,171 --> 01:17:41,196
You can fly to the moon this way!

1169
01:17:41,406 --> 01:17:43,374
Let's fly south for the winter.

1170
01:17:43,575 --> 01:17:45,008
Why not?

1171
01:17:46,845 --> 01:17:47,903
I'm a bird!

1172
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:49,477
I'm a plane!

1173
01:17:49,681 --> 01:17:50,670
I'm...

1174
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:52,747
...going too high!

1175
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:55,849
Hey, Grandpa, I can't get down!

1176
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:57,055
Help!

1177
01:17:57,255 --> 01:17:58,882
Grandpa, the fan!

1178
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:01,150
It'll chop us to bits!

1179
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,590
We're in trouble!
I can't stop!

1180
01:18:03,862 --> 01:18:05,159
It's pulling me in!

1181
01:18:05,364 --> 01:18:07,229
I can't stop!

1182
01:18:07,432 --> 01:18:09,798
- What do we do?
- Grab hold of something!

1183
01:18:10,435 --> 01:18:13,029
There's nothing to grab onto! Help!

1184
01:18:13,505 --> 01:18:14,836
We'll be killed!

1185
01:18:15,173 --> 01:18:16,800
Help! Help!

1186
01:18:17,008 --> 01:18:19,841
Mr. Wonka, please!
Turn off the fan!

1187
01:18:23,248 --> 01:18:25,011
I'm going down!

1188
01:18:25,417 --> 01:18:28,147
Burp! If you don't,
it'll cut you to ribbons!

1189
01:18:28,353 --> 01:18:30,480
- I can't! Help!
- You've got to burp!

1190
01:18:30,689 --> 01:18:32,589
It's the only way!

1191
01:18:32,858 --> 01:18:35,156
That-a-boy! Burp again!

1192
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,260
That-a-boy! Come on!

1193
01:18:39,531 --> 01:18:41,692
That's wonderful, Charlie!

1194
01:18:48,206 --> 01:18:50,504
Grab on.
We're going to be all right.

1195
01:18:59,451 --> 01:19:00,645
Good boy!

1196
01:19:01,219 --> 01:19:03,585
From now on
we keep our feet on the ground.

1197
01:19:03,789 --> 01:19:05,882
Let's catch up to the others!

1198
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,187
I know what you're thinking.

1199
01:19:10,395 --> 01:19:12,420
They can't be doing that.

1200
01:19:12,631 --> 01:19:14,690
But they are. They have to.

1201
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:17,027
The Oompa Loompas can't do it.

1202
01:19:17,602 --> 01:19:19,797
The geese that lay the golden eggs!

1203
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:22,633
They're larger than ordinary geese.

1204
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:24,968
They're quadruple-size,
which produce...

1205
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:28,305
...octuple-size eggs.
They're laying overtime for Easter.

1206
01:19:28,513 --> 01:19:29,844
But Easter's over!

1207
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:32,081
They don't know that.

1208
01:19:32,284 --> 01:19:34,582
I'm trying to get ahead for next year.

1209
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:38,122
What if they drop an egg?

1210
01:19:38,623 --> 01:19:41,183
An omelette fit for a king, sir.

1211
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:43,118
Are they chocolate eggs?

1212
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:46,159
Golden chocolate eggs!
A great delicacy.

1213
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:47,831
But don't get too close.

1214
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:51,628
The geese are temperamental.
So we have the Eggdicator.

1215
01:19:51,970 --> 01:19:55,133
The Eggdicator tells the difference
between a good egg...

1216
01:19:55,807 --> 01:19:57,001
...and a bad egg.

1217
01:19:57,209 --> 01:20:00,610
If it's good, it's shined
and shipped over the world.

1218
01:20:00,979 --> 01:20:02,879
If it's a bad egg...

1219
01:20:03,815 --> 01:20:05,305
...down the chute.

1220
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:11,181
An educated Eggdicator.

1221
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:12,981
It's a lot of nonsense.

1222
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:16,527
A little nonsense now and then...

1223
01:20:16,728 --> 01:20:20,061
...Is relished by the wisest men.

1224
01:20:20,832 --> 01:20:22,527
I want a golden goose!

1225
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:23,826
Here we go again.

1226
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:25,696
All right, sweetheart.

1227
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:28,099
You'll get one as soon as we get home.

1228
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:30,672
No, I want one of those!

1229
01:20:31,343 --> 01:20:33,538
How much do you want for the goose?

1230
01:20:33,745 --> 01:20:35,144
- Not for sale.
- Name your price.

1231
01:20:35,347 --> 01:20:36,371
She can't have one.

1232
01:20:36,581 --> 01:20:37,878
Who says I can't?

1233
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:39,812
- The man with the funny hat.
- I want one!

1234
01:20:40,018 --> 01:20:42,043
I want a golden goose!

1235
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:43,312
Gooses!

1236
01:20:43,522 --> 01:20:44,716
Geeses!

1237
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:47,551
I want my geese to lay
gold eggs for Easter.

1238
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:49,989
- It will, sweetheart.
- At least 100 a day.

1239
01:20:50,195 --> 01:20:53,164
- Anything you say.
- And by the way!

1240
01:20:53,365 --> 01:20:54,662
I want a feast.

1241
01:20:54,866 --> 01:20:56,561
You ate before you came.

1242
01:20:56,768 --> 01:20:58,565
I want a bean-feast

1243
01:20:58,770 --> 01:20:59,566
One of those.

1244
01:20:59,771 --> 01:21:02,672
Cream buns and doughnuts
And fruitcake with no nuts

1245
01:21:02,874 --> 01:21:06,071
- So good you could go nuts
- You'll have it when you get home.

1246
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:09,543
No, now! I want a ball!

1247
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:11,840
I want a party

1248
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:14,108
Pink macaroons
And a million balloons

1249
01:21:14,386 --> 01:21:16,581
And performing baboons and...

1250
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:18,119
...give it to me

1251
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:19,521
Now!

1252
01:21:19,724 --> 01:21:21,851
I want the world

1253
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:24,358
I want the whole world

1254
01:21:24,563 --> 01:21:28,863
I want to lock it all up in my pocket
It's my bar of chocolate

1255
01:21:29,067 --> 01:21:32,036
Give it to me now

1256
01:21:32,237 --> 01:21:34,364
I want today

1257
01:21:34,573 --> 01:21:36,598
I want tomorrow

1258
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:39,436
I want to wear them
Like braids in my hair

1259
01:21:39,644 --> 01:21:41,737
And I don't want to share them

1260
01:21:45,584 --> 01:21:49,213
I want a party with roomfuls of laughter

1261
01:21:49,421 --> 01:21:52,219
10,000 tons of ice cream

1262
01:21:52,424 --> 01:21:56,793
And if I don't get the things I am after

1263
01:21:56,995 --> 01:22:00,431
I'm going to scream

1264
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:12,139
I want the works

1265
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:13,743
I want the whole works

1266
01:22:13,945 --> 01:22:16,573
Presents and prizes
And sweets and surprises

1267
01:22:16,781 --> 01:22:19,443
Of all shapes and sizes
And now

1268
01:22:19,684 --> 01:22:23,518
Don't care how
I want it now

1269
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:27,886
Don't care how
I want it now

1270
01:22:36,301 --> 01:22:38,030
She was a bad egg.

1271
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:40,697
Where's she gone?

1272
01:22:40,972 --> 01:22:44,135
Where all the other bad eggs go.
Down the garbage chute.

1273
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,367
The garbage chute!

1274
01:22:46,978 --> 01:22:48,343
Where does it lead to?

1275
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:50,138
To the furnace.

1276
01:22:50,482 --> 01:22:52,313
The furnace?

1277
01:22:53,151 --> 01:22:55,949
- She'll sizzle like a sausage.
- Not necessarily.

1278
01:22:56,154 --> 01:22:58,486
She could be stuck inside the tube.

1279
01:22:59,057 --> 01:22:59,853
Hold on!

1280
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:01,616
Veruca! Sweetheart!

1281
01:23:01,826 --> 01:23:03,657
Daddy's coming!

1282
01:23:06,131 --> 01:23:08,292
There'll be a lot of garbage today.

1283
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:11,367
Mr. Salt finally got what he wanted.

1284
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:14,129
- What's that?
- Veruca went first.

1285
01:23:14,339 --> 01:23:18,400
Mr. Wonka, they won't really
be burned in the furnace, will they?

1286
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:21,978
I think that furnace is lit
only every other day.

1287
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:24,740
So they have a good sporting chance.

1288
01:23:25,517 --> 01:23:28,975
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do

1289
01:23:29,187 --> 01:23:32,645
I've got another puzzle for you

1290
01:23:32,857 --> 01:23:35,917
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Dee

1291
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:39,864
If you are wise you'll listen to me

1292
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:43,397
Who do you blame
When your kid is a brat

1293
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:46,900
Pampered and spoiled
Like a Siamese cat

1294
01:23:47,105 --> 01:23:50,336
Blaming the kids
Is a lie and a shame

1295
01:23:50,542 --> 01:23:52,407
You know exactly

1296
01:23:52,610 --> 01:23:54,669
Who's to blame

1297
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:57,871
The mother and the father

1298
01:24:00,051 --> 01:24:02,281
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da

1299
01:24:02,721 --> 01:24:06,179
If you're not spoiled
Then you will go far

1300
01:24:06,391 --> 01:24:10,327
You will live in happiness too

1301
01:24:11,629 --> 01:24:15,622
Like the Oompa Loompa
Doompa Dee Do

1302
01:24:17,068 --> 01:24:19,866
The children are
disappearing like rabbits!

1303
01:24:20,071 --> 01:24:23,199
We still have each other.
Shall we press on?

1304
01:24:23,408 --> 01:24:25,376
Can't we sit down for a minute?

1305
01:24:25,577 --> 01:24:29,741
- The pace is killing me.
- Transportation has been arranged.

1306
01:24:34,419 --> 01:24:36,546
Behold the Wonkamobile!

1307
01:24:36,755 --> 01:24:38,723
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever."

1308
01:24:38,923 --> 01:24:41,756
Places, please.
The dance is about to begin.

1309
01:24:42,026 --> 01:24:44,551
Grab a seat, they're going fast!

1310
01:24:44,763 --> 01:24:47,231
What's that they're filling it up with?

1311
01:24:47,432 --> 01:24:50,230
Ginger ale, ginger pop,
ginger beer, beer bubbles...

1312
01:24:50,435 --> 01:24:53,734
...bubble cola, double cola,
double-bubble burp-a-cola...

1313
01:24:53,938 --> 01:24:56,907
...that carbonated stuff
that tickles your nose.

1314
01:24:57,108 --> 01:25:00,009
Few people realize the power
in one of those things.

1315
01:25:00,278 --> 01:25:02,143
I'm sorry I asked.

1316
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:05,406
Would Slugworth pay extra
to know about this?

1317
01:25:05,617 --> 01:25:08,552
Just keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut.

1318
01:25:10,054 --> 01:25:11,248
Everybody set?

1319
01:25:11,456 --> 01:25:12,753
Will this go fast?

1320
01:25:12,957 --> 01:25:15,755
It should. It's got more gas
than a politician!

1321
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:19,896
Hold on. I'm going to open her up
and see what she can do.

1322
01:25:27,972 --> 01:25:29,963
Swifter than eagles...

1323
01:25:30,241 --> 01:25:32,300
...stronger than lions.

1324
01:25:40,251 --> 01:25:42,151
It's getting in my eyes!

1325
01:25:42,587 --> 01:25:44,452
It's seeping in my shoes!

1326
01:25:44,656 --> 01:25:47,318
I'm soaked!
It'll never come out!

1327
01:25:47,826 --> 01:25:49,157
It's sticking to my gun!

1328
01:25:57,669 --> 01:26:01,105
My dress! My hair! My face!

1329
01:26:02,173 --> 01:26:05,006
I'm sending you
the cleaning bill, Mr. Wonka!

1330
01:26:08,112 --> 01:26:09,977
I'm dry cleaned!

1331
01:26:13,918 --> 01:26:15,044
Hey, Grandpa...

1332
01:26:15,253 --> 01:26:17,551
...what was that we just went through?

1333
01:26:17,755 --> 01:26:19,120
Hsaw Aknow.

1334
01:26:19,324 --> 01:26:22,293
- Is that Japanese?
- No, Wonka Wash spelled backwards.

1335
01:26:22,493 --> 01:26:24,620
That's it. The journey's over.

1336
01:26:24,829 --> 01:26:27,127
Finest bath I've had in twenty years!

1337
01:26:27,332 --> 01:26:28,731
Let's do it again!

1338
01:26:28,933 --> 01:26:32,266
- That's as far as it goes?
- Couldn't we have walked?

1339
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:36,968
If the Lord meant for us to walk
He wouldn't have invented roller-skates.

1340
01:26:37,175 --> 01:26:38,972
Would you put these on?

1341
01:26:39,177 --> 01:26:41,441
We have to be careful.

1342
01:26:41,946 --> 01:26:44,278
There's dangerous stuff inside.

1343
01:26:47,018 --> 01:26:48,212
Wonkavision!

1344
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:50,887
My very latest and greatest invention.

1345
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:53,822
- It's television!
- It's Wonkavision.

1346
01:26:54,025 --> 01:26:57,085
You all know how
ordinary television works.

1347
01:26:57,295 --> 01:26:59,593
I do! You photograph something...

1348
01:26:59,797 --> 01:27:02,425
...then it's split
into millions of pieces...

1349
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:06,570
...that fly through the air and arrive
at your TV set in the right order.

1350
01:27:07,372 --> 01:27:10,466
You should open your mouth
a little wider when you speak.

1351
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:13,336
If they can do it with a photograph...

1352
01:27:13,544 --> 01:27:15,637
...why not a bar of chocolate?

1353
01:27:18,549 --> 01:27:22,952
I shall now send this chocolate bar
from one end of the room to the other.

1354
01:27:23,154 --> 01:27:26,555
It has to be big, because
when you transmit by television...

1355
01:27:26,824 --> 01:27:28,382
...it always ends up smaller.

1356
01:27:29,227 --> 01:27:30,888
Goggles on, please.

1357
01:27:33,064 --> 01:27:35,157
Lights... camera...

1358
01:27:35,366 --> 01:27:36,560
...action!

1359
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:40,065
You can remove your goggles.

1360
01:27:40,905 --> 01:27:42,133
Where's the chocolate?

1361
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:44,570
It's flying over our heads
in a million pieces.

1362
01:27:47,412 --> 01:27:49,073
Now watch the screen.

1363
01:27:51,916 --> 01:27:53,247
Here it comes.

1364
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:55,986
There it is.

1365
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:57,343
Take it.

1366
01:27:57,622 --> 01:27:59,214
How? It's just a picture.

1367
01:27:59,424 --> 01:28:00,755
All right, you take it.

1368
01:28:02,193 --> 01:28:03,057
It's real!

1369
01:28:03,261 --> 01:28:04,159
Taste it!

1370
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:06,262
Delicious
It's just gotten smaller.

1371
01:28:08,599 --> 01:28:09,566
It's perfect!

1372
01:28:09,767 --> 01:28:10,734
Unbelievable!

1373
01:28:10,935 --> 01:28:11,663
A miracle!

1374
01:28:11,869 --> 01:28:12,733
A TV dinner!

1375
01:28:12,937 --> 01:28:13,733
It's Wonkavision.

1376
01:28:13,938 --> 01:28:15,405
It could change the world!

1377
01:28:15,606 --> 01:28:17,403
Can you send other things?

1378
01:28:17,608 --> 01:28:19,667
- Not just chocolate.
- Anything you like.

1379
01:28:19,877 --> 01:28:21,208
What about people?

1380
01:28:21,446 --> 01:28:22,879
People?

1381
01:28:24,282 --> 01:28:27,012
I don't really know.
I suppose I could.

1382
01:28:27,218 --> 01:28:30,244
Yes, I'm sure I could.
I'm pretty sure I could.

1383
01:28:30,455 --> 01:28:32,082
But it might have messy results.

1384
01:28:32,290 --> 01:28:35,521
I'm going to be the first person
to be sent by television!

1385
01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:36,785
Get away!

1386
01:28:37,128 --> 01:28:38,425
Stop. Don't. Come back.

1387
01:28:38,629 --> 01:28:40,290
Lights... camera... action!

1388
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:45,767
Where are you?

1389
01:28:45,970 --> 01:28:48,200
He's up there, in a million pieces.

1390
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:51,967
- Mike, are you there?
- No good shouting. Watch the screen.

1391
01:28:55,146 --> 01:28:57,444
Mike? Why is he taking so long?

1392
01:28:57,648 --> 01:28:59,707
A million pieces
take time to put together.

1393
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:02,613
- Where are they?
- There's something coming through.

1394
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:05,584
- Is it Mike?
- It's hard to tell, but...

1395
01:29:06,424 --> 01:29:08,517
The little groover's getting smaller.

1396
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:12,958
Look at me! I'm the first person
in the world to be sent by television!

1397
01:29:13,731 --> 01:29:16,131
Wow, what a wild trip that was!

1398
01:29:16,334 --> 01:29:18,894
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me!

1399
01:29:19,103 --> 01:29:22,266
Am I coming in clear?
Mom I said, am I coming in clear?

1400
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:24,808
Great. He's completely unharmed.

1401
01:29:25,009 --> 01:29:27,136
You call that unharmed?!

1402
01:29:27,345 --> 01:29:30,314
Wow! That was something!
Can I do it again?

1403
01:29:30,982 --> 01:29:32,142
There'll be nothing left!

1404
01:29:32,350 --> 01:29:34,477
Don't worry, Mom.
I feel fine.

1405
01:29:34,685 --> 01:29:36,653
I'm famous! I'm a TV star!

1406
01:29:36,854 --> 01:29:38,913
Wait till the kids 
back home hear about this!

1407
01:29:39,123 --> 01:29:40,420
Nobody is gonna hear about this!

1408
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:42,058
Where are you taking me?

1409
01:29:42,293 --> 01:29:43,760
I don't want to go in there!

1410
01:29:43,961 --> 01:29:45,189
Be quiet!

1411
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:46,622
Well?

1412
01:29:47,298 --> 01:29:50,995
Fortunately, small boys
are extremely springy and elastic.

1413
01:29:51,202 --> 01:29:55,002
So, I think we'll put him in my
special taffy-pulling machine.

1414
01:29:55,206 --> 01:29:56,764
To the Taffy-Pulling Room.

1415
01:29:56,974 --> 01:30:00,740
The boy is in his mother's purse.
But be extremely careful.

1416
01:30:02,713 --> 01:30:04,647
What's he saying?

1417
01:30:04,882 --> 01:30:07,476
No, I won't hold you responsible.

1418
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:12,450
And now, my dearest lady,
it's time to say good-bye.

1419
01:30:12,657 --> 01:30:14,454
No, no! Don't speak!

1420
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:18,891
For some moments in life,
there are no words. Run along now.

1421
01:30:25,403 --> 01:30:26,233
Adieu.

1422
01:30:27,905 --> 01:30:30,567
"Parting is such sweet sorrow."

1423
01:30:39,584 --> 01:30:42,576
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do

1424
01:30:43,187 --> 01:30:46,020
I've got another puzzle for you

1425
01:30:46,724 --> 01:30:49,386
Oompa Loompa Doompa Da Dee

1426
01:30:50,394 --> 01:30:53,056
If you are wise you'll listen to me

1427
01:30:53,931 --> 01:30:56,627
What do you get from a glut of TV?

1428
01:30:56,834 --> 01:31:00,065
A pain in the neck and an IQ of 3

1429
01:31:00,571 --> 01:31:03,563
Why don't you try simply reading a book?

1430
01:31:04,075 --> 01:31:06,635
Or could you just not bear to look?

1431
01:31:06,844 --> 01:31:08,334
You'll get no

1432
01:31:11,415 --> 01:31:14,009
You'll get no commercials

1433
01:31:14,418 --> 01:31:18,081
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Da

1434
01:31:18,923 --> 01:31:21,585
If you like reading you will go far

1435
01:31:23,027 --> 01:31:25,689
You will live in happiness too

1436
01:31:26,764 --> 01:31:28,026
Like the...

1437
01:31:28,432 --> 01:31:29,592
...Oompa...

1438
01:31:30,434 --> 01:31:33,198
...Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Do!

1439
01:31:37,141 --> 01:31:41,578
So much to do, so much to do.
Invoices, bills, letters.

1440
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:44,570
I must answer that note from the Queen.

1441
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:47,543
What will happen to the others?

1442
01:31:49,153 --> 01:31:50,177
My dear boy...

1443
01:31:50,421 --> 01:31:52,446
...they'll be quite all right.

1444
01:31:52,657 --> 01:31:57,594
When they leave here they'll be restored
to their normal, terrible old selves.

1445
01:31:58,162 --> 01:32:00,790
But maybe a little wiser for the wear.

1446
01:32:00,998 --> 01:32:02,465
Don't worry.

1447
01:32:02,667 --> 01:32:05,101
What do we do now, Mr. Wonka?

1448
01:32:05,503 --> 01:32:09,735
I hope you enjoyed yourselves.
Excuse me for not showing you out.

1449
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:11,806
Up the stairs. I'm busy.

1450
01:32:12,009 --> 01:32:14,944
A whole day wasted.
Good-bye to you both.

1451
01:32:18,516 --> 01:32:22,008
What happened?
Did we do something wrong?

1452
01:32:22,286 --> 01:32:24,186
I don't know, Charlie.

1453
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:26,848
But I'm going to find out.

1454
01:32:45,209 --> 01:32:47,507
I am extraordinarily busy, sir.

1455
01:32:47,712 --> 01:32:50,203
I wanted to ask about the chocolate.

1456
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:54,049
The lifetime supply of chocolate?
For Charlie.

1457
01:32:54,552 --> 01:32:56,019
When does he get it?

1458
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:58,347
- He doesn't.
- Why not?

1459
01:32:58,556 --> 01:33:00,683
Because he broke the rules.

1460
01:33:00,891 --> 01:33:03,689
What rules?
We didn't see any rules, did we?

1461
01:33:03,894 --> 01:33:05,953
Wrong, sir! Wrong!

1462
01:33:06,163 --> 01:33:09,621
Under Section 37-B of the
contract signed by him...

1463
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:13,895
...it states clearly that all offers
shall become null and void if...

1464
01:33:14,171 --> 01:33:17,140
...and you can read it
for yourself in this copy:

1465
01:33:17,341 --> 01:33:18,808
"I, the undersigned...

1466
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:21,877
"...shall forfeit all rights,
privileges and licenses...

1467
01:33:22,079 --> 01:33:24,206
"...herein contained," etcetera...

1468
01:33:24,415 --> 01:33:25,382
"...fax mentis...

1469
01:33:25,583 --> 01:33:28,552
"...incendium gloria culpam,"
etcetera, etcetera.

1470
01:33:28,753 --> 01:33:31,381
"Memo bis punitor della cattum!"

1471
01:33:31,589 --> 01:33:34,888
It's all there! Black and white!
Clear as crystal!

1472
01:33:35,092 --> 01:33:37,322
You stole Fizzy-Lifting drinks!

1473
01:33:37,528 --> 01:33:41,157
You bumped into the ceiling which 
now has to be washed and sterilized!

1474
01:33:41,365 --> 01:33:43,390
So you get nothing!

1475
01:33:43,601 --> 01:33:44,898 
You lose!

1476
01:33:45,102 --> 01:33:47,263
Good day, sir!

1477
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:49,438
You're a crook!

1478
01:33:49,874 --> 01:33:52,570
A cheat and a swindler,
that's what you are!

1479
01:33:52,777 --> 01:33:54,745
How can you do this?!

1480
01:33:54,945 --> 01:33:58,574
Build up a little boy's hopes and
then smash his dreams to pieces!

1481
01:33:58,783 --> 01:34:00,580
You're an inhuman monster!

1482
01:34:00,785 --> 01:34:03,049
I said, "Good day"!

1483
01:34:06,791 --> 01:34:09,282
Come on, Charlie.
Let's get out of here.

1484
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:12,588
I'll get even,
if it's the last thing I do.

1485
01:34:12,797 --> 01:34:15,732
If Slugworth wants a Gobstopper,
he'll get one.

1486
01:34:48,599 --> 01:34:51,124
"So shines a good deed...

1487
01:34:51,335 --> 01:34:53,667
"...in a weary world."

1488
01:34:57,641 --> 01:34:59,268
My boy.

1489
01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:01,241
You've won!

1490
01:35:01,445 --> 01:35:03,310
You did it! You did it!

1491
01:35:03,514 --> 01:35:06,779
I knew you would!
I just knew you would!

1492
01:35:08,018 --> 01:35:10,816
Forgive me for putting you through this.

1493
01:35:11,021 --> 01:35:14,149
Come in, Mr. Wilkinson.
Charlie, meet Mr. Wilkinson.

1494
01:35:14,358 --> 01:35:15,586
- Pleasure.
- Slugworth!

1495
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:18,318
That's not Slugworth!
He works for me!

1496
01:35:18,529 --> 01:35:20,827
- For you?
- I had to test you, Charlie.

1497
01:35:21,031 --> 01:35:24,023
And you passed the test.
You won!

1498
01:35:24,301 --> 01:35:26,428
- Won what?
- The jackpot, my dear sir!

1499
01:35:26,637 --> 01:35:29,265
- The grand and glorious jackpot!
- The chocolate?

1500
01:35:29,473 --> 01:35:32,840
The chocolate, yes.
But, that's just the beginning!

1501
01:35:33,043 --> 01:35:36,501
We have so much time
and so little to do!

1502
01:35:36,714 --> 01:35:38,614
Strike that. Reverse it.

1503
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:40,579
This way, please!

1504
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:43,044
We'll take the Wonkavator.

1505
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:46,312
Step in, Charlie.
Grandpa Joe, sir.

1506
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:58,124
- This is the great glass Wonkavator.
- It's an elevator.

1507
01:35:58,335 --> 01:36:00,701
A Wonkavator.
An elevator goes up and down.

1508
01:36:00,905 --> 01:36:04,033
But the Wonkavator goes
sideways, slantways, backways...

1509
01:36:04,241 --> 01:36:05,538
And frontways?

1510
01:36:05,743 --> 01:36:07,711
...and any ways you can think of.

1511
01:36:08,245 --> 01:36:12,545
It can take you to any room by pressing
one of these buttons. Any button.

1512
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:15,412
Press a button and zing!
You're off.

1513
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:18,678
And up until now,
I've pressed them all.

1514
01:36:19,089 --> 01:36:20,522
Except one.

1515
01:36:21,358 --> 01:36:22,222
This one.

1516
01:36:23,594 --> 01:36:24,993
Go ahead, Charlie.

1517
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:26,424
Me?

1518
01:36:29,099 --> 01:36:30,361
There it goes!

1519
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:33,867
Hold on tight!

1520
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:37,204
I'm not exactly sure
what's going to happen.

1521
01:36:37,942 --> 01:36:41,400
Faster! If we don't pick up speed,
we won't get through.

1522
01:36:41,612 --> 01:36:43,045
Through what?

1523
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:45,746
- You mean, we're going...?
- Up and out.

1524
01:36:45,950 --> 01:36:48,885
This roof is glass.
It'll shatter in 1,000 pieces!

1525
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:51,553
- We'll be cut to ribbons!
- Probably.

1526
01:36:55,292 --> 01:36:56,953
Hold on, everybody!

1527
01:36:58,128 --> 01:37:00,494
Here it comes!

1528
01:37:15,579 --> 01:37:19,413
- You did it! Congratulations!
- Get up, take a look.

1529
01:37:20,150 --> 01:37:21,777
Our town looks so pretty.

1530
01:37:21,986 --> 01:37:23,283
Look over here, Charlie.

1531
01:37:23,487 --> 01:37:25,148
I think I see our house.

1532
01:37:27,491 --> 01:37:28,890
It really looks beautiful.

1533
01:37:29,093 --> 01:37:30,617
There's my school!

1534
01:37:37,167 --> 01:37:39,260
How did you like the chocolate factory?

1535
01:37:39,603 --> 01:37:42,401
It's the most wonderful place
in the world.

1536
01:37:42,606 --> 01:37:44,631
I'm pleased to hear you say that...

1537
01:37:44,842 --> 01:37:47,140
...because I'm giving it to you.

1538
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:50,577
- What?
- That's all right, isn't it?

1539
01:37:50,781 --> 01:37:53,443
- You're giving Charlie the...
- I can't go on forever.

1540
01:37:53,684 --> 01:37:55,709
And I don't really want to try.

1541
01:37:56,020 --> 01:38:00,957
Who can I trust to run the factory, and
take care of the Oompa Loompas for me?

1542
01:38:01,191 --> 01:38:02,488
Not a grown-up.

1543
01:38:02,693 --> 01:38:05,856
A grown-up would do
everything his way, not mine.

1544
01:38:06,196 --> 01:38:09,825
That's why I decided long ago
that I had to find a child.

1545
01:38:10,034 --> 01:38:11,695
A very honest...

1546
01:38:12,036 --> 01:38:13,469
...loving child...

1547
01:38:13,971 --> 01:38:17,338
...to whom I can tell all my
precious candy-making secrets.

1548
01:38:17,541 --> 01:38:20,066
- That's why you sent the Golden Tickets.
- That's right.

1549
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:22,802
The factory's yours.
You can move in immediately.

1550
01:38:23,047 --> 01:38:25,038
- And me?
- Absolutely.

1551
01:38:25,482 --> 01:38:27,677
- What happens to the rest...
- The whole family.

1552
01:38:27,885 --> 01:38:29,716
I want you to bring them all.

1553
01:38:33,390 --> 01:38:34,823
But Charlie...

1554
01:38:35,993 --> 01:38:39,690
...don't forget what happened to the man
who got everything he wanted.

1555
01:38:39,897 --> 01:38:40,955
What happened?

1556
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:43,497
He lived happily ever after.
