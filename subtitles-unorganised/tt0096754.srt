1
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:07,109
Sixty knots? No way, Barnes.
The Reds don't have anything that fast.

2
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,571
Checked it twice.
I mean, it's a real unique signature...

3
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:14,116
no cavitation,
no reactor noise.

4
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,869
It doesn't even sound
like screws.

5
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,921
What the hell is it?

6
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:31,884
I'll tell you what it's not.
It's not one of ours.

7
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:36,263
<i>Sir, contact changing
to heading 2-1-4,</i>

8
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,807
Speed:

9
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,809
Eighty knots.

10
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,770
<i>Eighty knots,</i>

11
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,231
<i>Still diving,
Depth, 900...</i>

12
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:49,109
Still diving.
Depth, 900 feet.

13
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:52,446
Port clearance, 150 feet
from the cliff wall, sir.

14
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,115
- It's getting tight in here.
- Yeah?

15
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,534
We can still give 'em
a haircut.

16
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:02,706
Helm, come right to 0-6-niner,
down five degrees.

17
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,334
<i>Coming right 0-6-niner,
down five degrees, aye,</i>

18
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,086
Port side clearance, 120 feet.
Narrowing to 75.

19
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,756
<i>Sir, we have a proximity warning light.</i>

20
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,300
It's too damn close.
We gotta back off.

21
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,469
<i>Sir, range to contact, 200,</i>

22
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:19,765
Contact just jinked to bearing 2-6-0
and accelerated to...

23
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:24,019
to 130 knots, sir.

24
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,563
Nothin' goes 130.

25
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,483
Sir, range to contact,
100 yards.

26
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,610
<i>Eighty yards, sir!</i>

27
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,654
Sixty!

28
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,167
It's turbulence.
We're in its wake.

29
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,211
Helm, all stop.
Full right rudder.

30
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,714
Hydraulics failure.
Planes not responding, sir.

31
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,554
Hydraulics restored, sir.

32
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,934
Oh, my God.

33
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:11,316
Collision alarm!
Collision alarm!

34
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,362
Fire control to sonar!

35
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,702
Let's get out of here!

36
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:25,455
- Lighten her up, Charlie!
- Torpedo room is flooded, sir!

37
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:29,543
Blow all tanks! Blow all the tanks!
Blow everything!

38
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,551
- All back full!
- Answering. All back full.

39
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,179
Give me a damage report.
What's our depth?

40
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,058
Passing 1,400, sir.

41
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,269
Main's forward tanks
are ruptured!

42
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,271
<i>Still descending, sir,</i>

43
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,857
1,450.

44
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,154
Passing 1,500, sir.

45
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,781
<i>Still descending,</i>

46
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,034
We're too deep
to pump auxiliary.

47
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,329
<i>- Passing 1,650, Still descending, sir,
- We're losin' her.</i>

48
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:09,958
<i>- Passing 1,600, and still descending,
- Launch the buoy.</i>

49
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:14,046
<i>- Passing 1,650, Passing 1,700, sir,
- Launching!</i>

50
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,272
<i>Benthic Explorer, Salvor 1 on final.</i>

51
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,983
<i>Copy you, Salvor 1,
This is Benthic Explorer.</i>

52
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,402
You're cleared to land.

53
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,779
Hey. They're coming.

54
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:32,708
- This, uh, could get pretty ugly.
- Yeah.

55
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,252
<i>It does not look good
at all,</i>

56
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:12,748
Oh, no.
Look who's with 'em.

57
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,541
<i>Queen bitch
of the universe,</i>

58
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,045
<i>Sonny, how you doing?</i>

59
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,964
I got two more welds
on this bypass valve.

60
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,968
<i>No light from the surface,
How deep are they?</i>

61
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,013
- McBride?
- 1,700 feet.

62
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,015
I need them
to go below 2,000.

63
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,392
No problem.
They can do that.

64
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,937
So that's it?

65
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,357
You just cheerfully turn
the whole thing over to the goon squad?

66
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:42,653
Look, I was told to cooperate.
I'm cooperating.

67
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,655
Kirkhill, you're pathetic.

68
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,157
Get Brigman on the line.

69
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,243
Hippy, get me Bud.

70
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,962
Catfish. Get them old buns
up here and give me a hand.

71
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:04,132
<i>Hang on, I'll be
up there in a second,</i>

72
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,139
You guys are milkin'
that job.

73
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:16,228
It's 'cause we love freezin'
our butts off out here for you so much.

74
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,571
- Hey, Bud!
- Yeah?

75
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,656
Hippy's on the bitch box.

76
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,701
It's a call from Topside.
Benthic company man.

77
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:32,703
- Kirkhill?
- Yeah.

78
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,205
That guy don't know his butt
from a rat hole.

79
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,875
Harry, do me a favor.
Square away this mud hose.

80
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,795
Get rid of these empty sacks. This place
is startin' to look like my apartment.

81
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,797
You got it, boss.

82
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,178
<i>Bud, pick up the topside line, urgent,</i>

83
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:53,515
I'm comin'. I'm comin'.
Geez, keep your panty hose on.

84
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,690
Brigman here.

85
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:02,774
Yeah, Kirkhill,
what's goin' on?

86
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,820
At 0922 local time today,

87
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,907
<i>an American nuclear submarine,
the USS Montana,</i>

88
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:14,161
with 156 men aboard went down
about 22 miles from here.

89
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,872
<i>- Damn.
- Been no contact with the sub since,</i>

90
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,458
<i>The cause of the incident
is not known,</i>

91
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:24,046
<i>Your company's authorized the Navy's use
of this facility for a rescue operation,</i>

92
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,299
<i>Code name.
"Operation Salvor,"</i>

93
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:31,595
- You want us to search for the sub?
- No. We know where it is.

94
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,931
But she's in 2,000 feet of water
and we can't reach her.

95
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:37,559
We need divers to enter the sub
and search for survivors, if any.

96
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,229
Don't you guys have your own stuff
for this kind of thing?

97
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:44,107
By the time we get our rescue
submersibles, storm front will be on us.

98
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,944
You can get your rig in under the storm
and be on site in 15 hours,

99
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:49,196
and that makes you
our best option.

100
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,324
Why should we risk our butts
for something like this?

101
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,285
I have been authorized to
offer special bonuses...

102
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,788
equivalent to three times
normal dive pay.

103
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,790
Yes, sir, buddy!

104
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,668
Hell, for triple time,
I'd eat Beanie.

105
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:05,671
They could set me on fire and
put me out with horse piddle.

106
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:09,716
I don't know what kind of deal
you made with the company,
but my people are not qualified.

107
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,010
- We're oil workers.
- This is a paycheck, man!

108
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,346
Shut up!
Hold it down.

109
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,349
This is Lieutenant Coffey.

110
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,519
He'll transfer down to you with
a SEAL team and supervise the operation.

111
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:23,814
You can send down whoever you like,
but I'm the tool pusher on this rig,

112
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:28,902
and when it comes to the safety
of these people, there's me and
then there's God, understand?

113
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:33,323
<i>If things get dicey,
I'm pullin'the plug,</i>

114
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:36,952
I think we're all
on the same wavelength, Brigman.

115
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,997
Now, let's get the wellhead
uncoupled, shall we?

116
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,334
All right,
let's get ready to move.

117
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:14,406
Let's take it
about five degrees left, all right?

118
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,202
Roger.
Five degrees left, Bud.

119
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:29,838
Plot these numbers to our position.
I need to know when...

120
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,383
Well, it's official, sports fans.
They're calling it Hurricane Frederick.

121
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:38,305
And it's gonna be making our lives
real interesting in a few hours.

122
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,849
<i>Fred, huh?
I don't know, man,</i>

123
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:43,227
I think hurricanes should be
named after women, don't you?

124
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,571
- I can't believe you're
letting them do this.
- Hi, Linds.

125
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,407
I thought you were
in Houston.

126
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,661
I was. Now I'm here.

127
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:04,039
- Only here isn't where
I left it, is it, Bud?
- Wasn't up to me.

128
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:08,126
Jesus! We were that close
to proving a submersible
drilling platform could work.

129
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:11,713
- I can't believe
you let them grab my rig!
- Your rig?

130
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,715
I designed the damn thing.

131
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,844
And Benthic Petroleum paid for it, so as
long as they're holding the pink slip,

132
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,846
I go where they tell me.

133
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,057
I had a lot riding on this,
and they bought you, didn't they?

134
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,059
More like rented you cheap!

135
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,104
I'm switchin' off now.
Bye-bye.

136
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:30,983
Oh, okay, Virgil, you wiener!
You never could stand up to a fight.

137
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,318
Bye-bye.

138
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,320
Virgil?

139
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:40,659
God, I hate that bitch.

140
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,662
Probably shouldn't have
married her then, huh?

141
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,586
Try to get it settled!

142
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:58,177
<i>Roger, Cab 3, You're clear to launch,</i>

143
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:03,473
- Hang on, gentlemen.
- She's clear!

144
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,687
Touchdown.
Crowd goes wild.

145
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,818
<i>Explorer,
this is Cab 3. We are styling.</i>

146
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:19,031
- How are you boys doing back there?
- Great.

147
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:24,828
<i>Explorer, this is Cab 3 starting
our descent along the umbilical.</i>

148
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:29,500
<i>- Roger that, Cab 3, Good luck,
- Luck is not a factor.</i>

149
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:36,089
#And I've been from Tucson
to Tucumcari #

150
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:39,051
#Tehachapi to Tonopah #

151
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:44,723
# Driven every kind of rig
that's ever been made #

152
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:49,603
# Driven the back roads
so I wouldn't get weighed ##

153
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:53,065
<i>Deep Core, Deep Core,
this is Cab 3 on final approach,</i>

154
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,401
Roger, Cab 3.
Is that you, Lindsey?

155
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:58,987
None other.

156
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,075
Oh, no.

157
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,059
Howdy, boys. Hey, Lindsey.
I'll be damned.

158
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:32,771
<i>Y'all shouldn't be down here,
sweet thing, Might ruin your stockings,</i>

159
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:41,905
The bad news is we got eight
hours in this can blowing down,

160
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:46,076
and the worse news is it's gonna
take us three weeks to decompress later.

161
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,328
We've all been fully briefed,
Mrs. Brigman.

162
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,914
Just don't call me that, okay?
I hate that.

163
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:56,753
All right. Well, what would you
like us to call you?

164
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,755
"Sir"?

165
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,594
Okay, here we go.

166
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:06,471
Y'all start equalizin'...
now.

167
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:14,229
Let's watch each other closely
for signs of H.P.N.S.

168
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:17,441
High Pressure Nervous Syndrome... muscle
tremors, usually in the hands first,

169
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:20,194
- nausea, increased excitability...
- Disorientation...

170
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,613
#And a partridge
in a pear tree ##

171
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:28,243
About one person in 20 can't handle it.

172
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:30,245
They just go "buggo. "

173
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,956
Look, they've all made runs
to this depth. They're checked out.

174
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,918
I understand that. What I'm saying
is that it's impossible...

175
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,920
to predict
just who's susceptible...

176
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:41,256
They're checked out.

177
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:47,012
- These guys are SEALs?
- Yeah. These guys ain't so tough.

178
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,264
I've fought guys
plenty tougher than them.

179
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:52,684
Now we get to hear how
you could have been a contender?

180
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,604
<i>- Hey! You see this?
- Yeah,</i>

181
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,649
They used to call this
"the Hammer. "

182
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,567
Wow.

183
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,911
Y'all are done to a turn
and ready to serve.

184
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,455
Everybody okay?

185
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,878
- They're really very sweet.
- Oh, yeah.

186
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:23,674
Hey! I don't remember putting
a wall here. How you doing, Jammer?

187
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,176
- Pretty good. How are you, little lady?
- I'm okay.

188
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,853
- I want a full check on that gear.
- Yes, sir.

189
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:39,606
- These guys are about
as much fun as a tax audit.
- You got that right.

190
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:58,876
<i>Hippy, you're gonna give
that rat a disease,</i>

191
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,878
<i>Hi, Linds,</i>

192
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,757
Well, well.
Mrs. Brigman.

193
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:07,759
Not for long.

194
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:14,308
You never did like
being called that, did you?

195
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,269
Not even when
it meant something.

196
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,857
- Is that One Night in Flatbed?
- Yeah. Who else?

197
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,861
- Here. Say hi.
- Hey, One Night, it's Lindsey.

198
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,654
Oh, hi, Lindsey.

199
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,954
So, what are you doing down here,
hot rod?

200
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,167
You need me. Nobody knows the systems
on this rig better than I do.

201
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,713
<i>Once you're disconnected from
Explorer, you are on your own
for how long this storm lasts.</i>

202
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:48,467
What if something was to happen
after surface support clears?
What would you have done?

203
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:52,554
You're right. Us poor, dumb old boys
might've had to think for ourselves.

204
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,807
It could have been
a disaster.

205
00:16:55,933 --> 00:17:00,062
- Wanna know what I think?
- Jesus, look where this thing is set.

206
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:03,440
- You wanna know what I think?
- Not particularly.

207
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,443
- I think you were worried about me.
- Then that must be it.

208
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,238
Seriously, I think you were.
Come on.

209
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:12,616
It's okay.
You can admit it.

210
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:17,621
I was worried about the rig. I've
got four years invested in this project.

211
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:22,251
Yeah. You only had
three years invested in me.

212
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:25,003
Well, you have
to have priorities.

213
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,504
Oh, shit.

214
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,383
I'm cuttin' you loose, Bud.

215
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:14,928
<i>One Night,
stay clear, We're settin'her down,</i>

216
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:21,935
<i>Touchdown!</i>

217
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,608
This is us. We're sitting right
on the edge of the Cayman Trough.

218
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,610
<i>This is the Montana,</i>

219
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:33,697
300 meters away,
70 meters below us.

220
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:38,202
We think she slid down the wall,
and now sits here on this outcropping.

221
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:41,538
So we're gonna have to
drop straight down here.

222
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:44,166
This tell us how much radiation
we're gettin'?

223
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:49,421
- I'm not going near radiation. No way!
- Aw, Hippy, you pussy.

224
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:53,383
What good is the money?
Six months later, your dick drops off.

225
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:56,470
What is your problem, huh?

226
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,555
<i>On this dive, you'll do
absolutely nothing...</i>

227
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:02,476
without direct orders from me,
and you'll follow those orders
without discussion.

228
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,603
Is that clear?

229
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:06,188
<i>All right,</i>

230
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:09,024
I want everyone finished, prepped and
ready to get wet in 15 minutes.

231
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:14,905
Keep it coming.

232
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,741
Keep it coming.

233
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:21,245
- Hippy, throw me one
of them cyalumes, please.
- Yeah, sure.

234
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,039
- Good. Good.
- Excuse me.

235
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:28,085
- What is all this stuff?
- Fluid-breathing system.
We just got them.

236
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:32,005
- You use it when you go really deep.
- How deep?

237
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,716
- Deep.
- How deep?

238
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:39,596
It's classified. Anyway, you breathe
liquid so you can't get compressed.

239
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:40,889
- The pressure doesn't get you.
- You mean you got liquid in your lungs?

240
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:46,395
- Oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion.
- Bullshit.

241
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:50,107
Check this out.

242
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,485
- Can I borrow your rat?
- What are you doin'?

243
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,738
- Hey, no, no, no.
- You're gonna kill her!

244
00:19:56,864 --> 00:20:00,534
- It's okay. I've done this myself.
- Are you just drownin' her?

245
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,536
She's gonna be fine.

246
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:05,122
I've breathed this myself.
It's gonna be fine.

247
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,875
No, man. She's gonna drown!
Look! She's freakin' out!

248
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,919
<i>- Just going through
a normal adjustment period,
- Does this look normal to you?</i>

249
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:14,882
<i>- She's gonna drown!
- He's taking the fluid into his lungs,</i>

250
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:18,886
He's taking the fluid
into his lungs.

251
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:24,516
There he goes.
There's a bit of anxiety here.

252
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,061
<i>Now he's starting to relax,
He's breathing fine,</i>

253
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:31,023
<i>See his chest moving?
He's getting plenty of oxygen,</i>

254
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,692
<i>Ha, Damn rat's
breathin'that shit,</i>

255
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:38,530
That is no bullshit, hands down,
the goddamnedest thing I ever saw.

256
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:42,034
See, the fluid's harder to push in
and out than air.

257
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:45,245
<i>It's a little more work to breathe,
but he's doing fine,</i>

258
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,248
- He's diggin' it.
- She's doin' it. She ain't diggin' it.

259
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,042
Let her out now. Now!

260
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,711
Okay. All right.

261
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:56,548
Okay, now we let
the fluid drain from his lungs.

262
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:59,218
All right. Give her here.
Give her. Give her.

263
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:01,637
Here's your rat.

264
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:05,891
<i>- See? He's fine,
- It's a she.</i>

265
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:06,099
Going over the wall.

266
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,143
Going over the wall.

267
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:10,687
Coming to bearing 0-6-5.

268
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,899
Flatbed, you on line?

269
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:16,902
<i>10-4, Lindsey,
We read you loud and clear,</i>

270
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:21,281
Starting our descent.
Divers, how you doin'?

271
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,367
Everybody's okay so far.

272
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,912
Hang on, boys.
It's all downhill from here.

273
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:29,915
Hey, how deep's
the drop-off here?

274
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:34,920
This here's a bottomless pit, baby...
two-and-a-half miles straight down.

275
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,927
<i>Cab 3, it's Bud, You on-line?</i>

276
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,847
Cab 3, check.
I'm right behind you.

277
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:52,104
Cab 1, do you see it yet?

278
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:56,149
Magnetometer's twitching,
but I don't see anything yet.

279
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:59,111
Hang on. I want to test my strobes.

280
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:05,576
<i>Cab 1, do you have a visual?</i>

281
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:11,582
<i>- Cab 1, do you copy?
- Yeah.</i>

282
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:14,001
Roger that. Found it.

283
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:31,185
<i>Cab 1, radiation readings,</i>

284
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,896
Neutron counter's
not showing much.

285
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:37,816
All right. Just continue
forward and along the hull.

286
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,988
Copy that. Continuing forward. You want
me to get shots of everything, yes?

287
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:46,033
<i>Roger that, Document as much as you can,
but please keep moving,</i>

288
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:48,785
Remember, we're on
a tight time line.

289
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:50,787
Copy that.

290
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:57,586
Coming up to the midship's hatch.
Do you see it, Cab 3?

291
00:22:57,711 --> 00:23:00,172
Yeah, roger.
I got it.

292
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:06,720
<i>- How do you want me?
- Just hold above it,</i>

293
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,806
<i>- Roger. Holding.
- Okay, it's all yours, Lieutenant,</i>

294
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,935
All right, A-team.
Let's do it.

295
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:31,411
Okay, Perry, Hippy,
let's get that R.O.V. Launched.

296
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:34,540
Okay, we're on it, boss. Go.

297
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,421
<i>Little Geek
is on the case,</i>

298
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,517
Monk here, sir.

299
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,644
We got the midship's
outer hatch open.

300
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:57,771
Goin' in.

301
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,029
<i>- Coffey, these are
the missile hatches, right?
- That's right,</i>

302
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:11,160
Looks like a couple of the hatches
have sprung. Radiation's nominal.

303
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:13,245
Warheads must
still be intact.

304
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:18,292
- How many are there?
- 24 trident missiles.
8 MI RVs per missile.

305
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:22,421
That's 192 warheads,
Coffey.

306
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:25,632
- How powerful are they?
- Your MI RV is a tactical nuke.

307
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:29,094
50 kilotons
nominal yield,

308
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,180
say, five times Hiroshima.

309
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:49,990
<i>- Just set it down here,
- Copy that,</i>

310
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:54,578
There's a breach in the pressure hull.
That's where we go in.

311
00:24:56,497 --> 00:24:59,416
- We're solid.
- Let's go.

312
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,878
All right. Let's go.

313
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:15,599
Okay, let's just take it
slow and easy goin' in.

314
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:18,268
Don't take any chances.

315
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:46,088
Where are we, Coffey?

316
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:50,259
This is the forward
berthing compartment. This way.

317
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:06,233
Come on. Let's keep up.

318
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:09,444
All right. Up this way
to the control center.

319
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:40,976
- It's jammed. Give me a hand.
- Get up here with that pry bar.

320
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,229
It's moving!
Pull!

321
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:54,531
Jesus!

322
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:59,453
All right. We knew we were
gonna see this. Just move on.

323
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:05,834
Come on, Jammer.
Let's go.

324
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:43,080
<i>Okay, let's stay cool,</i>

325
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:45,332
Everybody stay cool.

326
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:50,379
We can't help these guys,
but we might find somebody further in.

327
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:00,347
- Hey, Jammer. You okay?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

328
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,058
How you guys doin'?

329
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:06,770
- I'm dealin'.
- Triple time sounded like
a lot of money, Bud. It ain't.

330
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:08,814
We're here.
Let's get 'er done.

331
00:28:08,939 --> 00:28:12,776
Brigman, take your men
and continue aft.

332
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,988
Split up into two teams.

333
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:19,158
Come on. Let's get moving.
We head back in 14 minutes.

334
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:21,743
Let's go.

335
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:38,260
- You still with me, Jammer?
- Where are we?

336
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:42,014
Missile compartment.
Those are the launch tubes.

337
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:54,359
Shit! Shit, shit, shit!

338
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:57,654
Hey, Jammer.

339
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:01,325
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! You okay?

340
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,494
Deep and slow,
big guy.

341
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:05,954
Deep and slow.
Just breathe easy.

342
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:08,290
Everybody's dead!
They're all dead.

343
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:11,168
- I'm taking you back out. Let's go.
- No!

344
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:13,504
I'm okay. I'm okay.

345
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:22,054
- I just can't go any further in.
- Okay, Jammer. No problem.
You stay right here.

346
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:25,307
I've got to check out
this compartment, all right?

347
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:29,478
We'll stay in voice contact.
You hold on the end of this rope here.

348
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:33,774
- You have any problem whatsoever,
you tug twice.
- I got it.

349
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:38,153
Pull it hard. Five more minutes.
Just relax. You'll be okay.

350
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,864
- Okay.
- Be right back.

351
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,287
You still readin' me
okay, big guy?

352
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,539
<i>Read you fine, Bud,</i>

353
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:38,714
Okay, just a few
more minutes.

354
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:42,676
There's a couple compartments
up ahead that might have air.

355
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:45,804
<i>- Okay, no problem,
- We got to be sure, right?</i>

356
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:49,725
<i>Hang on, Jammer, You just hold
on to that...</i>

357
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:59,067
Shit!
Bud?

358
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:02,821
Bud, can you hear me?
Bud? Bud?

359
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:07,201
Goddamn it!

360
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,633
Oh, Jesus!

361
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:53,163
Bud, is that you?

362
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:19,231
Hang on, Jammer.

363
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:24,778
Lew, Cat, hurry up! On the double!

364
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:27,114
<i>I'm on my way,</i>

365
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:37,791
Jammer!

366
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:40,836
<i>- What's the problem?
- He's convulsing!</i>

367
00:32:41,962 --> 00:32:45,340
It's his mixture.
Too much oxygen.

368
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:50,429
Got to get the O-2 cut down!
Turn him over!

369
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:53,640
Crank it down, man!
You're losin' him!

370
00:32:55,642 --> 00:33:00,606
All right. We got to get him
out of here. Let's go. Let's move it.

371
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:03,942
Easy, big fella.
That's it.

372
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:07,613
One Night, do you see the divers?
Are they out yet?

373
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:11,742
Negative, Lindsey.
Haven't seen hide nor hair.

374
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:15,621
Let's give them two minutes more max,
and then I'll sound a diver recall...

375
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:38,560
Lindsey, do you copy?

376
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:42,773
Meet me at Flatbed. This is a diver
emergency. Linds, do you copy?

377
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:45,984
Uh, yeah, copy you, Bud.
L-I'm on my way.

378
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:56,411
Look, I'm just a medic,
which is mostly about patchin' holes.

379
00:33:56,537 --> 00:34:01,625
This type of thing, it's...
There's not much I can do.

380
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:04,628
A coma could last
hours or days.

381
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:14,054
So you didn't get
anything on the cameras.

382
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,515
No. I didn't get
a picture of it.

383
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:18,725
- What about the video?
- No.

384
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:23,730
We lost power right then. Look, I just
don't want to talk about this, okay?

385
00:34:23,814 --> 00:34:26,483
Fine. Be that way.

386
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:29,027
Look, I don't know
what I saw, Bud, okay?

387
00:34:29,111 --> 00:34:33,240
Coffey wants to call it
a Russian submersible, fine,
it's a Russian submersible.

388
00:34:33,365 --> 00:34:37,870
- No problem.
- Yeah, but you think
it was somethin' else.

389
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:41,665
What?
One of ours?

390
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:48,005
- No.
- Well, whose then?

391
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:53,093
Come on, Lindsey,
talk to me.

392
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:57,055
Look, Jammer saw something
down there, something that
scared the hell out of him.

393
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:00,767
His mixture got screwed up.
Jammer panicked.

394
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:03,437
He pranged his regulator,
and his mixture got screwed up.

395
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:05,981
But what did he see
that made him panic?

396
00:35:08,025 --> 00:35:09,985
Well, what do you
think he saw?

397
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:14,239
I don't know.

398
00:35:14,364 --> 00:35:18,410
- Did any of you see it?
- No, sir. The Brigman woman saw it.

399
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:20,496
It could have been
a Russian bogey.

400
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:25,375
Oh, Cinclantfleet's
gonna go ape shit.

401
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:29,588
Two Russian attack subs,
a Tango and a Victor,
were tracked within 50 miles of here.

402
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:33,091
<i>Now they don't know
where the hell they are, Okay,</i>

403
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:36,178
I haven't got any choice.

404
00:35:36,303 --> 00:35:38,639
I'm confirming you
to go to phase two.

405
00:35:38,764 --> 00:35:41,099
<i>You'll recover
one warhead, arm it...</i>

406
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:42,142
<i>and wait for
further instructions,</i>

407
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:48,065
- We got a problem with that?
- Negative, sir.

408
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:52,820
- Better come on.
- Turn it up, folks.

409
00:35:52,903 --> 00:35:56,031
<i>Sources have not confirmed any reports
that the Montana encountered...</i>

410
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:59,201
a Soviet fast-attack sub
prior to its sinking,

411
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:02,371
and the Kremlin continues
to deny any involvement.

412
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:05,916
<i>- Oh, that's us. That's us, man.
- That's the Explorer.</i>

413
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:08,377
...off-shore driling rig is apparently
participating in the recovery operation.

414
00:36:08,502 --> 00:36:11,004
There is a tremendous
amount of activity.

415
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:13,382
With Cuba only 80 miles away,

416
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:15,717
the massive buildup
of American forces...

417
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:19,263
has drawn official protest
from Havana and Moscow.

418
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:23,892
<i>Russian and Cuban trawlers,
undoubtedly surveillance vessels,</i>

419
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:26,228
<i>have been circling
the area,</i>

420
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:30,065
<i>- and Soviet aircraft have
repeatedly been warned away,
- This sucks.</i>

421
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:32,568
Hippy, what's the matter
with you?

422
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:34,570
What's the matter with me?
Nothing.

423
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:37,573
We're just in the middle
of some big-time international incident,

424
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:39,616
like the Cuban missile crisis
or something.

425
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:41,869
Figured that out for yourself,
did you, Hip?

426
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:43,871
We got Russian subs
creepin' around.

427
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:47,875
Anything goes wrong, they could say
whatever they want happened.

428
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:50,460
Relax, will you?
You're makin' the women nervous.

429
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:55,215
- Cute, Virgil.
- You know, those SEALs
ain't telling us diddly.

430
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:57,759
- Somethin' is going on!
- Come on, come on.

431
00:36:57,843 --> 00:37:00,304
Hippy, you think everything's
a conspiracy.

432
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:02,306
Everything is.

433
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:05,058
Hurry up!
Coffey's splitting with Flatbed.

434
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:08,187
- I showed him how to work the controls,
and they're outta here.
- Damn it.

435
00:37:08,312 --> 00:37:11,398
- Didn't you tell him
we need it right now?
- He didn't pay attention.

436
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:13,734
<i>- Where the hell is he taking it?
- I have no idea!</i>

437
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:17,404
Shit! Coffey! Come back!

438
00:37:17,488 --> 00:37:21,074
We need the big arm
to unhook the umbilical.

439
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:24,453
There's a goddamn
hurricane comin'!

440
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:26,914
<i>- He switched off,
- It's unbelievable.</i>

441
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:29,875
Go back down.

442
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,587
Tell those men to get below
and stay there.

443
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:47,017
We need to get unhooked
and get out of here now.

444
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:49,019
All right, do it then.

445
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:51,855
No problem, except your boys
went sightseeing with Flatbed.

446
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,608
My people need Flatbed
to get unhooked at their end.

447
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:56,819
- Back in two hours.
- Two hours?

448
00:37:56,944 --> 00:38:00,656
We're gonna get the shit kicked
out of us by our pal Fred in two hours.

449
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:03,325
Okay, it's clear.

450
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,203
It's all yours, sir.

451
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:10,999
- Swing it away and drop it.
- Check. Okay.

452
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:15,587
Bypass the ground connection
on the separation sequencer.

453
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:20,592
- Got it?
- Separation sequencer disconnected.

454
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:24,304
Remove explosive bolts one through
six in counterclockwise sequence.

455
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:26,306
Check.
Removing bolt one.

456
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:52,791
All right. Let's get their gear off!
Then clear the sub.

457
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:56,461
We got to get it out of here!
Come on. Let's go. Let's move it.

458
00:38:56,545 --> 00:38:59,506
One Night, you're up.
Get ready to roll, baby.

459
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:02,176
<i>- Don't touch that. Just back away.
- Excusez-moi,</i>

460
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:07,681
Hey, Coffey, we are
a little pressed for time.

461
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:16,231
Prick. This ain't no drill,
slick. Make me proud.

462
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:19,693
Piece of cake, baby.

463
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:54,603
<i>What's the problem, One Night?</i>

464
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:59,858
All hell must be breaking loose
up there. This cable's pissin' me off.

465
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:04,196
<i>- I can't get a grip on it.
- Well, keep tryin', baby,
Just keep tryin',</i>

466
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:07,032
Son of a bitch!

467
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:11,161
Shit! We got a problem!

468
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:14,206
- What's going on?
- We're losing number two thruster!

469
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:17,042
<i>Bearing's going!</i>

470
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:20,712
- It's not holding. We're
swinging out of position here!
- Goddamn it!

471
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:32,015
Ooh! Jesus.

472
00:40:39,273 --> 00:40:40,941
Ah, shit!

473
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:54,413
- The rig is movin'!
- Yeah, I can see that.

474
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:57,332
Topside! Pay out some slack.
We're gettin' dragged.

475
00:40:57,457 --> 00:41:00,502
<i>- Down on number one winch!
Down on one!
- We're gettin'dragged!</i>

476
00:41:06,175 --> 00:41:09,178
Bud, we're headed right
for the drop-off.

477
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:42,211
<i>What the hell?
We just lost all the topside feeds,</i>

478
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:49,676
Shit! Get him on the U.Q. C.!
Bud!

479
00:41:51,303 --> 00:41:53,639
<i>- We lost the crane!
- Say again. What?</i>

480
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:58,560
The crane! We've lost the crane!
It's on its way down to you!

481
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:02,814
All right, everybody.
Everybody, rig for impact!

482
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,818
<i>Close all the exterior hatches!</i>

483
00:42:05,943 --> 00:42:09,196
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

484
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:11,198
Wait, wait, wait!

485
00:42:11,323 --> 00:42:14,243
Get in here!

486
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:17,496
What the hell is goin'
on around here?

487
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,498
I don't know.

488
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:29,299
You two help secure the rig.
Let's go.

489
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:41,186
One Night, you hear me?
Get the hell out of there!
The crane's comin' down!

490
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,198
I'm okay. I'm clear, Bud.

491
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:06,211
I've got it.
It's headed straight for us.

492
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:12,569
Oh, shit.

493
00:44:24,998 --> 00:44:28,335
<i>- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Oh, my God!</i>

494
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:31,588
<i>- Bud!
- Grab on to something!</i>

495
00:44:36,468 --> 00:44:38,929
Jesus!

496
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:50,607
- Battery rooms front. Let's go!
- Cat, put that out!

497
00:44:52,067 --> 00:44:53,986
- Bud!
- Yeah?

498
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:58,115
- Drill room's floodin'!
- Get back down there!

499
00:44:58,198 --> 00:45:02,536
Go! I'll take
the battery room. Jesus!

500
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:23,932
Shit!

501
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:28,645
Get out of there!
Close the door! Seal the room!

502
00:45:37,112 --> 00:45:41,033
Lindsey,
let's get out of here!

503
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:53,253
Whoa!

504
00:46:44,429 --> 00:46:46,849
Let's get the hell
out of here!

505
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:50,727
Aaah!

506
00:46:50,853 --> 00:46:52,729
Let's go!

507
00:46:52,855 --> 00:46:55,232
Let's go!
Get the door!

508
00:46:55,357 --> 00:46:57,234
Get the door!

509
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:00,612
- Aaah!
- Jesus!

510
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:05,576
Bud! Bud!

511
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:15,210
Finler, cut the hose!

512
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:17,212
Cut the line
to the motor!

513
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:19,548
I can't open it
from out here!

514
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:23,051
<i>Finler, cut the hose!</i>

515
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:26,722

Hey! Hey!

518
00:48:00,589 --> 00:48:02,466
Come on, Sonny!

519
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:04,593
<i>Hey, Cat!
Help me out, man!</i>

520
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:06,970
Hang on!

521
00:48:07,095 --> 00:48:09,932
The hose! Cut the hose!

522
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:12,434
The line to the motor!
Hurry up!

523
00:48:16,772 --> 00:48:19,107
Come on, Cat!

524
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:21,109
Hurry!

525
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:24,029
Come on, Sonny, help me out!
Come on, push!

526
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:26,615
Come on, Sonny!

527
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:32,037
- Let's go!
- Come on, let's go!
We gotta go, go, go!

528
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,706
Get outta here!
Come on, move it!

529
00:48:34,832 --> 00:48:38,335
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Get the hatch, Cat!

530
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,379
Get the hatch!
Get the hatch!

531
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:56,687
You all right?
Everybody okay?

532
00:48:56,812 --> 00:48:59,356
<i>- Yeah,
- Yeah. Oh, son of a bitch.</i>

533
00:48:59,481 --> 00:49:01,358
Oh, man.

534
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:10,576
<i>Benthic Explorer, this is Deep Core 2,</i>

535
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:11,660
<i>Do you read me?</i>

536
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:19,126
<i>Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer,
this is Deep Core.</i>

537
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:21,128
Do you read me?
Over.

538
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:23,630
Forget it, Sonny.
They're gone, man.

539
00:49:26,383 --> 00:49:28,302
Mayday, mayday,
mayday.

540
00:49:28,385 --> 00:49:30,304
Hey.

541
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:32,306
They're gone.

542
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:43,066
Hey, Jammer.

543
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:49,448
<i>Jesus,</i>

544
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:52,868
<i>- Shh!
- Wait a second, I got it, I got it,</i>

545
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:55,871
<i>- I'll do it,
- You'll do it yourself,</i>

546
00:49:55,996 --> 00:49:57,873
Find your buddy?

547
00:49:57,998 --> 00:49:59,875
No.

548
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,960
Tighter. Tighter.

549
00:50:02,044 --> 00:50:04,296
- Brigman.
- What?

550
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:09,384
I was under orders.
I had no choice.

551
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:25,734
How's it goin', Cat?

552
00:50:37,788 --> 00:50:39,665
What's the scoop, Ace?

553
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:43,168
Well, I can get power
to this module in sub bay...

554
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:45,170
if I reroute these buses,

555
00:50:45,295 --> 00:50:48,715
but I gotta get past the mains,
which are a total meltdown.

556
00:50:48,841 --> 00:50:53,303
Bud, there won't be enough
to run the heaters.

557
00:50:53,428 --> 00:50:57,015
In a few hours, this place
is gonna be as cold as a meat locker.

558
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,017
What about O-2?

559
00:50:59,142 --> 00:51:01,019
Yeah, well, brace yourself.

560
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:05,524
If we close off the sections
we're not using, we have
about maybe 12 hours' worth.

561
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:10,696
Storm's gonna last
a lot longer than 12 hours.

562
00:51:10,821 --> 00:51:15,701
Yeah, well,
I can maybe extend that. Maybe.

563
00:51:15,826 --> 00:51:19,538
There's some storage tanks outboard
next to the wrecked module.

564
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:22,541
I'll have to go outside,
though, and tie onto them.

565
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:28,213
Hey, Linds.

566
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:30,966
- Linds.
- Yeah?

567
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:32,968
I'm glad you're here.

568
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:34,970
Yeah.

569
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:37,389
I'm not.

570
00:51:49,776 --> 00:51:52,654
<i>Where are you now, Linds?</i>

571
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:55,157
I'm under
the starboard trimodule.

572
00:51:57,618 --> 00:52:00,871
<i>- Still with me, Hip?
Right behind you, Linds,</i>

573
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:12,674
How's it look?

574
00:52:12,758 --> 00:52:15,677
You guys really screwed up my rig.

575
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:17,679
There's a lot
of wreckage out here.

576
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:21,183
- Well, don't get fouled.
- Hit me with that 9/16, okay?

577
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:22,726
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

578
00:52:58,428 --> 00:53:01,139
<i>Come on,
Let's see those muscles,</i>

579
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:04,726
<i>Bingo, That's one,</i>

580
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,728
Two for two.

581
00:53:06,812 --> 00:53:08,730
Hey. Hey.

582
00:53:10,107 --> 00:53:11,984
Lindsey, do you read me?
Over.

583
00:53:13,235 --> 00:53:15,779
Copy you, Hippy.
What's the matter?

584
00:53:17,364 --> 00:53:20,576
Oh, shit. The power's jackin'
around with us again.

585
00:53:20,659 --> 00:53:22,494
Lindsey, come back.

586
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:25,747
<i>I just lost video,
Lindsey, are you there?</i>

587
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:29,751
Hippy, do you copy?

588
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:35,090
Linds, you copy?

589
00:53:35,174 --> 00:53:37,092
Shit.

590
00:53:37,176 --> 00:53:40,304
What the hell...
Hippy, do you copy?

591
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:44,850
Damn it.
Bud, do you copy? Over.

592
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:50,689
Uh, I seem to be having
a problem here.

593
00:56:08,702 --> 00:56:10,621
Shit.

594
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:25,511
Damn it.

595
00:56:57,876 --> 00:57:01,421
- That's a great shot, Linds.
- You drop your dive line?

596
00:57:01,547 --> 00:57:03,423
Come on, you guys.
Come on.

597
00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:07,094
That's the smaller one. You can
kinda see how it's zigging around.

598
00:57:07,219 --> 00:57:10,097
- Yeah, whatever it is.
- I'm telling you what it is.

599
00:57:10,222 --> 00:57:12,599
- You're just not hearing me.
- Now, Lindsey, you...

600
00:57:12,724 --> 00:57:16,061
There is something down there.
Something not us.

601
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:18,897
You could be more... specific.

602
00:57:18,981 --> 00:57:21,900
- Something that zigs.
- Not us.

603
00:57:21,984 --> 00:57:24,611
Not human. Get it?

604
00:57:24,736 --> 00:57:27,364
Something nonhuman, but intelligent.

605
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:37,583
A nonterrestrial intelligence.

606
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:40,252
- A nonterrestrial intelligence.
- Yes.

607
00:57:40,377 --> 00:57:43,589
N.T.I.s. Oh, man,
that's better than U.F.O.s.

608
00:57:43,714 --> 00:57:46,800
But that works too, huh?
Underwater flying objects.

609
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:55,058
Are we talking
little space friends here?

610
00:57:55,142 --> 00:57:58,061
Hell, yeah! Hot rods of the gods!
Right, Linds?

611
00:57:58,145 --> 00:58:00,230
No, really.
It could be N.T.I.s.

612
00:58:00,355 --> 00:58:02,274
The C.I.A. Has known
about 'em forever.

613
00:58:02,357 --> 00:58:04,276
They abduct people
all the time.

614
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:08,405
Hippy, would you do me a favor?
Stay off my side.

615
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:11,450
- Will you step into my office, please?
- Certainly.

616
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:14,953
L... Come here.

617
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:18,874
- Jesus, Linds.
- Oh, Bud, come on.

618
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:20,876
Something really important
is happening here.

619
00:58:20,959 --> 00:58:22,878
I'm trying to keep this situation
under control.

620
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:25,881
- I can't allow you to create
this kind of hysteria.
- Who's hysterical?

621
00:58:25,964 --> 00:58:28,383
- Nobody's hysterical!
- Shh.

622
00:58:28,467 --> 00:58:31,386
All I'm saying is, when you're
hangin' on by your fingernails,

623
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:33,805
you don't go
waving your arms around.

624
00:58:33,931 --> 00:58:36,850
Look, I saw something. I'm not gonna
say I didn't see it when I did.

625
00:58:36,975 --> 00:58:38,852
I'm sorry.
Please.

626
00:58:38,977 --> 00:58:41,355
You are the most stubborn woman
I ever knew.

627
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,357
Yes. I am.

628
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:46,360
But I need you
to believe me right now.

629
00:58:46,485 --> 00:58:49,530
Come on, look at me.
Am I stressed out?

630
00:58:49,655 --> 00:58:53,617
Do I have any symptoms of pressure
sickness? Tremor? Slurred speech?

631
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:57,204
- No.
- No.

632
00:58:57,329 --> 00:59:00,332
Bud, this is me, Lindsey.
Okay?

633
00:59:00,457 --> 00:59:04,294
You know me better
than anybody in the world.

634
00:59:04,378 --> 00:59:06,630
Now watch my lips.

635
00:59:06,713 --> 00:59:09,800
I saw these things.

636
00:59:09,883 --> 00:59:11,802
I touched one of them,

637
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:15,806
and it wasn't some clunky steel can
like we would build.

638
00:59:17,224 --> 00:59:19,143
It glided.

639
00:59:20,394 --> 00:59:23,313
It was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

640
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:27,526
Oh, God,
I wish you'd been there.

641
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:31,029
It was a machine...
It was a machine, but it was alive.

642
00:59:31,155 --> 00:59:33,740
It was like a...
like a dance of light.

643
00:59:36,785 --> 00:59:39,204
Please. You have to trust me.

644
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:42,958
Now, I don't think they mean us
any harm. I don't know how I know that.

645
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:45,919
It's just a feeling.

646
00:59:46,044 --> 00:59:48,922
Geez. I'm supposed to
go on a feeling?

647
00:59:49,047 --> 00:59:51,925
How can I? You think Coffey's
gonna go on a feeling?

648
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:55,345
Well, we all see
what we wanna see.

649
00:59:55,429 --> 00:59:58,140
Coffey looks,
and he sees Russians.

650
00:59:58,223 --> 01:00:00,142
He sees hate and fear.

651
01:00:01,727 --> 01:00:04,938
You have to look
with better eyes than that.

652
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:10,944
- Please.
- I can't, Linds.

653
01:00:10,944 --> 01:00:13,280
- Please.
- I can't, Linds.

654
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:16,658
- No? Mmm.
- I'm sorry.

655
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:26,335
Got it.

656
01:00:48,357 --> 01:00:50,275
All right.

657
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:54,696
Come on, A.J. Squared-away,
a little to the left.

658
01:00:55,823 --> 01:00:57,699
<i>What is that?</i>

659
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:08,502
Oh, this is not happening.

660
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:12,965
Oh, man.

661
01:01:16,176 --> 01:01:19,847
<i>Look at me, I'm shakin',
All right, wait, wait, wait,</i>

662
01:01:19,972 --> 01:01:21,890
And now...

663
01:01:21,974 --> 01:01:24,059
here's MI RV.

664
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:30,023
Come on, man.
What else could it be?

665
01:01:30,149 --> 01:01:32,067
Why bring it here?

666
01:01:32,151 --> 01:01:36,196
It's gotta be some kind of emergency
plan to keep it away from the Russians.

667
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,199
Look, they hot-wire
one of the nukes,

668
01:01:39,283 --> 01:01:42,202
they use some kind of detonator
that they brought,

669
01:01:42,286 --> 01:01:45,706
then they stick it back in the sub,
fry the whole thing up.

670
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:48,208
Bam! Slicker than snot.

671
01:01:50,085 --> 01:01:53,130
I'm tellin' ya.
And I'm not bein' paranoi...

672
01:01:54,339 --> 01:01:56,258
Hi, Linds.

673
01:02:03,849 --> 01:02:06,268
Linds, will you just
wait a second.

674
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:09,271
Goddamn it, if you don't
do something about it, I will!

675
01:02:09,354 --> 01:02:12,608
Lindsey, we'll do something about it!
Just wait a second!

676
01:02:12,691 --> 01:02:14,610
- Lindsey.
- What?

677
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:16,695
- Just stop and think about this.
- What?

678
01:02:37,508 --> 01:02:40,511
<i>You got some huevos
bringing that thing into my rig.</i>

679
01:02:42,346 --> 01:02:46,099
With all that's going on
up in the world, you bring
a nuclear weapon in here?

680
01:02:46,183 --> 01:02:48,101
Mrs. Brigman...

681
01:02:48,185 --> 01:02:52,105
Does this strike anyone as particularly
psychotic, or is it just me?

682
01:02:52,189 --> 01:02:55,609
Mrs. Brigman, you don't need to know
the details of our operation.

683
01:02:55,692 --> 01:02:57,611
It's better if you don't.

684
01:02:57,694 --> 01:02:59,613
You're right.
I don't need to know.

685
01:02:59,696 --> 01:03:03,659
What I need to know
is that thing is off this rig!
Do you hear me, Roger Ramjet?

686
01:03:05,369 --> 01:03:08,455
You're becoming
a serious impediment to our mission.

687
01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:11,625
Now, you either do an about-face
and walk out of here,

688
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:13,669
or I'll have you
escorted out.

689
01:03:13,752 --> 01:03:16,922
I will not do an about-face
and get out of here.

690
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:19,424
Who do you think you're talking...

691
01:03:19,508 --> 01:03:22,344
Emergency! Maintenance Room B!
Everybody move it!

692
01:03:22,427 --> 01:03:24,763
<i>- On the double!
- Now! Now!</i>

693
01:03:24,847 --> 01:03:27,975
<i>In here! Come on! We've got trouble!</i>

694
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,018
- Now! Come on!
- What's goin' on?

695
01:03:30,102 --> 01:03:33,480
<i>- All right, all right,
all right, all right!</i>

696
01:03:33,564 --> 01:03:35,482
<i>What's up? What's happening?</i>

697
01:03:35,566 --> 01:03:38,318
You let her go, man.
Do it. Do it now!

698
01:03:39,403 --> 01:03:40,863
Let her go.

699
01:03:42,948 --> 01:03:45,492
That was the smartest thing
you ever did.

700
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:51,665
- Coffey, you son of a bitch...
- Lindsey! Cool it.

701
01:03:51,748 --> 01:03:54,334
<i>- What's the problem?
- Nothin'.</i>

702
01:03:54,418 --> 01:03:56,503
We were just leaving.
Weren't we?

703
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:19,359
W-We don't need them.

704
01:04:20,486 --> 01:04:22,404
We can't trust them.

705
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:29,369
We may have to take steps.

706
01:04:31,246 --> 01:04:33,665
We're gonna have to
take steps.

707
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:40,881
Linds, I want you to stay away
from that guy.

708
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:43,258
- I mean it.
- The guy is gone.

709
01:04:43,342 --> 01:04:45,260
Did you see his hands?

710
01:04:45,344 --> 01:04:47,262
What? He's got the shakes?

711
01:04:47,346 --> 01:04:49,264
Look, he's operating
on his own,

712
01:04:49,348 --> 01:04:51,767
he's cut off from
his chain of command,

713
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:55,103
he's showing signs
of pressure-induced psychosis...

714
01:04:55,187 --> 01:04:58,106
and he's got
a nuclear weapon.

715
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:02,110
So, as a favor to me, try to put
your tongue in neutral for a while.

716
01:05:02,194 --> 01:05:07,115
I gotta tell you, I give this whole
thing a sphincter factor of about 9.5.

717
01:05:07,783 --> 01:05:11,662
Look, you can just punch into
his primary guidance chip
where you want him to go...

718
01:05:11,787 --> 01:05:13,664
and he'll go there,
right?

719
01:05:13,789 --> 01:05:16,166
- No. Bad idea, Lindsey. Bad.
- Why? Hip, come on.

720
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:19,169
Because even if it could
take the pressure at that depth,

721
01:05:19,294 --> 01:05:21,171
- which I don't think it can,
- Yeah?

722
01:05:21,296 --> 01:05:24,174
Without the tether you know what'd
happen when it got down there?

723
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:26,176
It would just sit like...
Please.

724
01:05:26,301 --> 01:05:28,679
It would just sit
like a dumb shit.

725
01:05:28,804 --> 01:05:32,182
Something would have to pass in front
of the camera for you to see anything.

726
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:35,352
But we could get lucky, right?
So we should go for it.

727
01:05:35,477 --> 01:05:38,856
- I really ought to talk
to Bud about this.
- This is between you and me.

728
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:41,692
We get proof,
and then we tell the others.

729
01:05:41,817 --> 01:05:46,029
If we can prove to Coffey
that there aren't Russians down there,

730
01:05:46,155 --> 01:05:49,533
maybe he'll ease off the button
a little bit.

731
01:05:49,658 --> 01:05:54,496
I gotta tell ya, that guy
scares me more than anything
we're gonna find down there.

732
01:05:54,621 --> 01:05:58,917
He's a goddamn A.J. Squared-away,
jar-head robot.

733
01:05:59,001 --> 01:06:00,544
It's...

734
01:06:02,004 --> 01:06:04,882
All right, give me a couple hours
to see what I can do.

735
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:06,508
Great. Thanks.

736
01:06:20,272 --> 01:06:22,691
Virgil, turn on your side.

737
01:06:51,428 --> 01:06:54,348
All right,
you're all set, big guy.

738
01:06:54,431 --> 01:06:57,851
Hey, I told you
to wipe that grin off your face.

739
01:07:06,568 --> 01:07:08,445
Good night,
little buddy.

740
01:08:57,179 --> 01:08:59,681
Bud. Bud. Bud!

741
01:08:59,807 --> 01:09:01,683
Get up.

742
01:09:03,685 --> 01:09:05,562
What?

743
01:09:15,405 --> 01:09:17,324
Cat.

744
01:09:18,867 --> 01:09:20,869
- Cat!
- Hey!

745
01:09:20,953 --> 01:09:23,372
God... Leave me alone.

746
01:09:31,255 --> 01:09:33,257
Bud.

747
01:09:35,717 --> 01:09:38,178
Wait. It's okay.

748
01:09:38,262 --> 01:09:40,180
Sweet Christ Almighty.

749
01:09:40,264 --> 01:09:43,058
I think it likes you.

750
01:10:01,535 --> 01:10:03,787
It's trying to communicate.

751
01:10:05,581 --> 01:10:07,624
<i>That's Bud,</i>

752
01:10:09,918 --> 01:10:11,795
It's wonderful.

753
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:13,797
It's me.

754
01:10:17,092 --> 01:10:19,094
- No, no, no.
- Shh. It's okay.

755
01:10:19,219 --> 01:10:20,929
<i>What is it?</i>

756
01:10:23,807 --> 01:10:26,185
<i>Is it alive?</i>

757
01:10:28,896 --> 01:10:30,939
<i>Lindsey, no,</i>

758
01:10:32,608 --> 01:10:34,943
Sea water.

759
01:10:35,068 --> 01:10:36,904
<i>Oh, man,</i>

760
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:51,960
Come on. Come on!

761
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:57,216
- Hurry!
- Where the hell's it goin'?

762
01:10:58,759 --> 01:11:00,636
Huh?

763
01:11:07,726 --> 01:11:10,604
<i>Hurry! I think it's headed
for "B" module,</i>

764
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:12,606
Linds, you see it?

765
01:11:42,302 --> 01:11:44,179
- Aah!
- Aah!

766
01:11:47,599 --> 01:11:49,643
Aaah!

767
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:16,545
<i>So, raise your hand if you
think that was a Russian water tentacle,</i>

768
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:19,548
Lieutenant?

769
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:21,550
No? Well.

770
01:12:22,676 --> 01:12:24,553
A breakthrough.

771
01:12:24,678 --> 01:12:27,806
Hey, Ace, you done
impressin' yourself?

772
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:31,143
No way that thing
could just be sea water.

773
01:12:31,226 --> 01:12:35,856
They must have learned to control water.
I mean at a molecular level.

774
01:12:35,981 --> 01:12:39,359
They can plasticize it, polymerize it,
do whatever they want to do with it.

775
01:12:39,485 --> 01:12:42,362
They can put it
under intelligent control.

776
01:12:42,488 --> 01:12:46,241
Maybe their whole technology's
based on that.

777
01:12:46,366 --> 01:12:48,202
<i>- What?
- Controlling water.</i>

778
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:54,041
<i>- Was it the same thing
that you saw the last time?
- No,</i>

779
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:57,753
You know, I don't think that
that thing you saw was one of them.

780
01:12:57,878 --> 01:13:01,256
- What are you talking about?
- I mean, I don't think it was an N.T.I.

781
01:13:01,381 --> 01:13:05,093
I think it was their version
of an R.O.V., like Big Geek.

782
01:13:06,762 --> 01:13:10,140
<i>- Hippy, you mean
they was just checkin'us out?
- Yeah,</i>

783
01:13:10,224 --> 01:13:12,643
<i>- How come?
- Curious, I suppose,</i>

784
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:16,647
<i>We're probably the first people
that have ever seen one,
Who's been down this far?</i>

785
01:13:16,772 --> 01:13:20,651
<i>- Sure hope they don't
judge the rest of us by him,</i>

786
01:13:32,788 --> 01:13:34,623
Went straight
for the warhead,

787
01:13:34,748 --> 01:13:36,625
and they think it's cute.

788
01:13:55,727 --> 01:13:57,604
You need to get
some sleep.

789
01:14:07,948 --> 01:14:10,492
We have no way...

790
01:14:10,617 --> 01:14:13,662
of warning the surface.

791
01:14:13,787 --> 01:14:16,165
You know what that means?

792
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,503
It means whatever happens...

793
01:14:21,628 --> 01:14:23,505
is up to us.

794
01:14:24,882 --> 01:14:26,300
Us.

795
01:15:47,256 --> 01:15:49,132
Sniff somethin'?

796
01:15:52,761 --> 01:15:54,638
Did you, rat boy?

797
01:15:58,976 --> 01:16:01,520
Hey, hey, hey!

798
01:16:01,645 --> 01:16:04,189
Freeze! Don't move!

799
01:16:05,524 --> 01:16:07,276
That's right.

800
01:16:08,694 --> 01:16:10,696
You okay, Hip?

801
01:16:10,821 --> 01:16:14,199
- They're using Big Geek
to take the bomb to the N.T.I.s.
- What?

802
01:16:14,324 --> 01:16:17,452
- We set it up to go right to 'em.
- Oh, my God.

803
01:16:17,536 --> 01:16:19,454
Oh, my God.

804
01:16:19,538 --> 01:16:21,623
Take this.
We're going to phase three.

805
01:16:21,707 --> 01:16:25,127
What? We don't have orders for that!

806
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:27,045
<i>I programmed Big Geek...</i>

807
01:16:27,171 --> 01:16:30,048
<i>to go down to the bottom of the trench
and shoot some video,</i>

808
01:16:30,174 --> 01:16:33,719
<i>- Now they've got the warhead tied to it,
- Coffey?</i>

809
01:16:35,846 --> 01:16:38,056
- Linds...
- Coffey... No. Come on.

810
01:16:38,182 --> 01:16:41,059
Just think about
what you're doing just one minute.

811
01:16:41,185 --> 01:16:43,270
Just think about
what you're... Aaah!

812
01:16:43,353 --> 01:16:45,689
Get back!

813
01:16:45,814 --> 01:16:50,152
This is something
I've wanted to do since we first met.

814
01:16:58,118 --> 01:17:00,662
Easy. Easy.
Take it easy.

815
01:17:02,748 --> 01:17:04,666
Into the kitchen.
Let's go.

816
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,668
- Move, partner!
- Get your damn hands off of me!

817
01:17:06,752 --> 01:17:08,670
- Get in there!
- I know the way.

818
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:12,174
Your boss is fixin'
to pull the pin on 50 kilotons,

819
01:17:12,257 --> 01:17:15,010
and we're all
gonna be ringside!

820
01:17:15,093 --> 01:17:17,513
<i>He's having
a full-on meltdown!</i>

821
01:17:17,596 --> 01:17:19,973
<i>- What's the timer set for?
- Three hours,</i>

822
01:17:20,057 --> 01:17:21,975
<i>- Shut up. Don't talk.
- Three hours?</i>

823
01:17:22,059 --> 01:17:26,396
We can't get to minimum safe distance
in three hours.

824
01:17:26,522 --> 01:17:29,858
- We can't go to phase three.
What about these people?
- Shut up.

825
01:17:29,942 --> 01:17:32,361
What's the matter with you?

826
01:17:37,533 --> 01:17:39,409
Everybody just stay calm.

827
01:17:39,535 --> 01:17:41,411
The situation
is under control.

828
01:17:45,916 --> 01:17:48,794
Anybody touches that door, kill 'em.

829
01:17:53,757 --> 01:17:57,344
Schoenick, your lieutenant's about to
make a real bad career move.

830
01:17:57,427 --> 01:17:59,888
- The guy's crazier
than a shithouse rat!
- Schoenick!

831
01:17:59,972 --> 01:18:02,182
<i>- They're trying to make contact!
- Can't you see he's lost it?</i>

832
01:18:02,266 --> 01:18:04,810
- Shut up!
- The shock wave'll kill us.

833
01:18:04,935 --> 01:18:08,063
- Quiet!
- It'll crush this rig like a beer can.

834
01:18:08,147 --> 01:18:10,649
- What are you talking about?
- We gotta stop him.

835
01:18:10,774 --> 01:18:12,651
Shut up!

836
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:15,279
<i>This is not our mission,
We can't detonate without orders,</i>

837
01:18:15,404 --> 01:18:17,281
<i>Schoenick, please!</i>

838
01:18:30,294 --> 01:18:34,923
He's about to declare war
on an alien species just when
they're trying to make contact!

839
01:18:35,048 --> 01:18:36,967
Please!

840
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:39,470
- I think I'm reaching him.
- Yeah.

841
01:18:41,555 --> 01:18:43,974
<i>I'll be damned.</i>

842
01:18:47,019 --> 01:18:48,937
<i>- Jammer!
- Is everybody okay?</i>

843
01:18:49,021 --> 01:18:52,524
Oh, man!

844
01:18:52,649 --> 01:18:55,986
- Don't move, jar face!
- I'm the least of your problems.

845
01:18:56,069 --> 01:18:58,071
- Take it easy, Hippy.
- I'm all right.

846
01:18:58,155 --> 01:19:00,073
How you feelin',
big guy?

847
01:19:00,157 --> 01:19:02,075
I'm okay, Bud, I...

848
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:07,456
I just figured I was dead back there
when I saw that angel comin' for me.

849
01:19:08,665 --> 01:19:11,543
Uh... Yeah, okay.

850
01:19:12,669 --> 01:19:14,546
Tell us about it later.

851
01:19:20,427 --> 01:19:22,346
Come on.

852
01:19:22,429 --> 01:19:24,848
He's got it tied off
with somethin'.

853
01:19:24,932 --> 01:19:26,850
Ready?

854
01:19:28,185 --> 01:19:31,271
We're not gonna be able to budge it.

855
01:19:31,355 --> 01:19:33,941
Now what?
This is the only door to sub bay.

856
01:19:45,244 --> 01:19:48,664
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna swim to hatch six.

857
01:19:48,747 --> 01:19:50,332
What?

858
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:55,546
I'm gonna get inside
and open the door from the other side.

859
01:19:55,671 --> 01:19:58,048
Bud, this water is freezing.

860
01:19:58,173 --> 01:20:00,551
Then I guess
you'd better wish me luck.

861
01:20:00,676 --> 01:20:03,095
<i>- Wish us luck.
- You comin'along?</i>

862
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:05,681
<i>Looks that way,</i>

863
01:20:05,764 --> 01:20:08,809
- All right, Cat.
- Come on.

864
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:12,729
<i>- In case I don't die.
- This is insane,</i>

865
01:20:12,855 --> 01:20:15,482
Come on, Bud. Let's go, partner.
I ain't got all day.

866
01:21:15,959 --> 01:21:17,836
Come on, yank on it.

867
01:21:23,467 --> 01:21:25,594
Gonna have to...

868
01:21:25,719 --> 01:21:29,473
Have to go to the moon pool.
It's the only way.

869
01:21:29,598 --> 01:21:32,976
I can't.
I can't make it, partner.

870
01:21:33,101 --> 01:21:34,978
I'm real sorry.

871
01:21:36,605 --> 01:21:38,982
Okay. Okay, Cat.

872
01:21:39,107 --> 01:21:40,984
You head on back, all right?

873
01:21:50,285 --> 01:21:52,162
Shit!

874
01:23:15,537 --> 01:23:18,415
- What is he doing?
- He can't make it to the door.

875
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:21,418
He's gonna try
and take him out himself.

876
01:23:21,543 --> 01:23:25,130
No. Oh, God, he couldn't be that dumb.
That guy's a trained killer.

877
01:24:14,304 --> 01:24:15,764
No!

878
01:24:15,848 --> 01:24:18,475
Coffey. Coffey, listen...

879
01:24:32,281 --> 01:24:34,533
Hey!

880
01:25:24,917 --> 01:25:26,960
Aaaah!

881
01:25:54,071 --> 01:25:55,447
<i>Hey!</i>

882
01:26:10,254 --> 01:26:12,131
<i>Bud! You all right?</i>

883
01:26:12,256 --> 01:26:13,841
Get him, Cat!

884
01:26:18,804 --> 01:26:21,098
He's dogged it, Bud.

885
01:26:21,223 --> 01:26:23,100
We gotta get this
off of here.

886
01:26:26,728 --> 01:26:30,232
Come on, help me.
Pull the gripper! Pull it!

887
01:26:40,742 --> 01:26:42,619
<i>Cat, get the door,</i>

888
01:26:51,336 --> 01:26:53,255
Ohh! Shit.

889
01:26:54,339 --> 01:26:55,883
Come on!

890
01:26:57,468 --> 01:26:59,720
- Shoot! Shoot!
- Are you all right?

891
01:26:59,803 --> 01:27:02,139
The safety's on!
Safety's on!

892
01:27:02,264 --> 01:27:04,057
Give me that!

893
01:27:08,687 --> 01:27:11,482
<i>Come on, let's go!
Help me out!</i>

894
01:27:11,565 --> 01:27:14,485
- Give me a hand! Move it!
- One Night, what about Cab 1?

895
01:27:14,568 --> 01:27:16,069
Ready to launch.

896
01:27:16,153 --> 01:27:19,865
<i>Go! You're better
in these than I am!</i>

897
01:27:19,990 --> 01:27:22,117
You got air?
Come on, come on.

898
01:27:24,536 --> 01:27:26,580
<i>You got air,
You got air,</i>

899
01:28:18,382 --> 01:28:20,384
Shit.

900
01:29:51,141 --> 01:29:54,728
<i>Bud, get out of the way!</i>

901
01:30:00,526 --> 01:30:02,528
Shit!

902
01:30:23,924 --> 01:30:26,635
Get in! Hurry up!

903
01:30:26,718 --> 01:30:30,305
I'm comin', baby.
Keep your panty hose on.

904
01:30:39,148 --> 01:30:41,859
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

905
01:30:45,529 --> 01:30:48,365
- Do you see Big Geek?
- Yeah. Right out in front.

906
01:30:55,914 --> 01:30:57,708
- Oh, my God!
- Get after him!

907
01:30:57,791 --> 01:31:00,210
- Okay, okay! Get on the arm.
- Ease up. To the left.

908
01:31:00,294 --> 01:31:02,254
- A little more.
- You missed. Try it again.

909
01:31:02,379 --> 01:31:04,047
- Stand steady. Stand steady.
- Okay.

910
01:31:04,173 --> 01:31:05,757
- Grab it.
- Yeah. Got it!

911
01:31:05,883 --> 01:31:08,719
- Pretty slick, Slick.
- Hold it really steady.

912
01:31:08,844 --> 01:31:11,847
- Just hold it still.
- I am. I am.

913
01:31:20,772 --> 01:31:24,193
Shit! We lost Geek!

914
01:31:30,199 --> 01:31:32,284
Where is he?
Do you see him?

915
01:31:32,409 --> 01:31:34,369
I'll take a look.

916
01:31:36,205 --> 01:31:38,290
He's comin' up fast.
Step on it.

917
01:31:38,415 --> 01:31:40,542
Shit!

918
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:53,096
- Go to the right. Swing to the right.
- Shit.

919
01:32:08,695 --> 01:32:11,532
<i>Keep movin', baby,</i>

920
01:32:12,783 --> 01:32:15,452
Come here.

921
01:32:15,577 --> 01:32:18,080
That's right.

922
01:32:20,457 --> 01:32:23,585
<i>That son of a bitch,</i>

923
01:32:29,591 --> 01:32:31,844
- Ohhh!
- Hard left, baby. Left, left, left!

924
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:50,445
- Jesus Christ, lady.
- If you can do any better,
then you're welcome up here.

925
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:58,954
Son of a bitch.

926
01:33:01,582 --> 01:33:03,792
- Is he right on us?
- Yeah, he is right on your ass.

927
01:33:03,876 --> 01:33:06,336
- Okay. Okay.
- Where you goin'?

928
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:08,297
Hang on.

929
01:33:36,408 --> 01:33:38,744
Aaah!

930
01:34:51,441 --> 01:34:54,820
<i>Deep Core, this is Cab 1, Do you read?</i>

931
01:34:56,238 --> 01:34:59,116
Deep Core, Deep Core,
this is Cab 1. Over.

932
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:03,162
I'm not getting any answer.

933
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:06,957
And we're flooding
like a son of a bitch.

934
01:35:07,082 --> 01:35:08,959
Yeah? You noticed?

935
01:35:09,084 --> 01:35:12,296
You know, you did okay back there,
Virgil. I was fairly impressed.

936
01:35:12,421 --> 01:35:16,008
Yeah, well, not good enough.
We still gotta catch Big Geek.

937
01:35:16,133 --> 01:35:18,469
<i>Yeah? Well, not in this thing,</i>

938
01:35:18,552 --> 01:35:21,388
Deep Core, Deep Core,
this is Cab 1. Over.

939
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:26,101
Try it again.

940
01:35:26,226 --> 01:35:28,520
Deep Core, this is Cab 1.
We need assistance.

941
01:35:28,645 --> 01:35:30,939
<i>Over... Aaah!</i>

942
01:35:31,023 --> 01:35:33,400
<i>You all right?</i>

943
01:35:34,485 --> 01:35:37,029
Yeah.

944
01:35:41,909 --> 01:35:44,828
- Well, that's that.
- Yeah. Wonderful.

945
01:35:46,747 --> 01:35:50,083
There's light comin' from somewhere.
It's off to the right.

946
01:35:50,167 --> 01:35:52,169
<i>Yeah, That's the rig,</i>

947
01:35:52,252 --> 01:35:54,421
It's a good 60, 70 yards,
I'd say.

948
01:35:54,505 --> 01:35:56,632
Well, they'll come after us.

949
01:35:56,757 --> 01:35:59,676
Yeah, but it's gonna take 'em
a while to get here.

950
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:01,678
We gotta get
this flooding stopped.

951
01:36:03,931 --> 01:36:07,476
- Can you see where it's coming in?
- Yeah. Hold the lamp for me.

952
01:36:07,601 --> 01:36:10,020
There's a busted fitting
behind this panel.

953
01:36:10,103 --> 01:36:13,148
Problem is,
I don't think I can get to it.

954
01:36:13,273 --> 01:36:15,526
You got any tools?

955
01:36:15,609 --> 01:36:18,529
I don't know.
I'll have to look around.

956
01:36:18,612 --> 01:36:20,531
Yeah, well,
I looked already.

957
01:36:22,491 --> 01:36:25,869
Goddamn it, all I need is
a goddamn crescent wrench.

958
01:36:28,539 --> 01:36:31,750
Come on.

959
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:34,586
Aaaah!

960
01:36:34,711 --> 01:36:36,130
Shit!

961
01:36:36,213 --> 01:36:38,132
Son of a bitch!

962
01:36:38,215 --> 01:36:40,092
Okay, calm down, Bud.

963
01:36:41,218 --> 01:36:43,137
- Calm down.
- Okay.

964
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:45,139
Okay.

965
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:48,308
Okay.

966
01:36:50,102 --> 01:36:53,522
- We gotta get you out of here.
- How?

967
01:36:53,605 --> 01:36:56,525
- I don't know how.
- All right, we've only got one suit.

968
01:36:56,608 --> 01:36:59,778
- We've gotta come up with s...
- Oh, my God. I'm freezing.

969
01:36:59,903 --> 01:37:02,281
Come here. Come here a sec.

970
01:37:02,406 --> 01:37:06,160
Listen, you're smart.
Think of somethin'.
Can't you think of somethin'?

971
01:37:06,243 --> 01:37:09,830
Okay, why don't you swim back
to the rig and bring back another suit.

972
01:37:11,248 --> 01:37:14,835
That'd take me about
seven, eight minutes to swim,

973
01:37:14,918 --> 01:37:17,087
get the gear, come back.

974
01:37:17,212 --> 01:37:20,591
I wouldn't make it.
By the time I got back you'd be...

975
01:37:22,134 --> 01:37:24,052
- Okay.
- Linds.

976
01:37:24,136 --> 01:37:26,430
Let's look around.
Just look a... Oh, my God.

977
01:37:28,599 --> 01:37:30,517
Is that working?

978
01:37:30,601 --> 01:37:33,103
Shit.

979
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:46,700
- All right. All right, all right.
- Bud, I'm getting cold.

980
01:37:46,783 --> 01:37:49,703
- Here. You put this on.
- No, no! What are you...

981
01:37:49,786 --> 01:37:52,039
Don't argue with me.
Just put it on.

982
01:37:52,122 --> 01:37:55,042
- Look, this is not an option,
so just forget about it.
- Lindsey, shut up!

983
01:37:55,125 --> 01:37:56,794
Put this thing on.

984
01:37:56,919 --> 01:37:58,504
- Just be logical.
- Fuck logic!

985
01:37:58,629 --> 01:38:01,507
Please listen!
Just listen to me for one second.

986
01:38:01,632 --> 01:38:04,968
You've got the suit on, and you're a
much better swimmer than I am. Right?

987
01:38:05,052 --> 01:38:06,970
- Yeah, maybe...
- Right? Yes. So I've got a plan.

988
01:38:07,095 --> 01:38:10,140
- What's the plan?
- I drown, and you tow me
back to the rig.

989
01:38:10,265 --> 01:38:11,683
No. No!

990
01:38:11,809 --> 01:38:14,686
Yes. This water is only
a couple of degrees above freezing.

991
01:38:14,812 --> 01:38:17,189
I'd go into deep hypothermia.

992
01:38:17,314 --> 01:38:19,191
My blood'll go
like ice water. Right?

993
01:38:19,316 --> 01:38:22,152
My body systems will slow down.
They won't stop.

994
01:38:22,236 --> 01:38:24,655
- Linds...
- You tow me back and I can...

995
01:38:24,738 --> 01:38:28,158
I can be revived after
maybe 10 or 15 minutes.

996
01:38:28,283 --> 01:38:31,161
- Linds, you put this on.
- No! It's the only way.

997
01:38:31,286 --> 01:38:34,206
You just put this on.
You know I'm right.

998
01:38:34,331 --> 01:38:36,208
Please. It's the only way.

999
01:38:36,333 --> 01:38:39,628
You've got all the...
stuff... on the rig to do this.

1000
01:38:39,711 --> 01:38:41,922
Put this on.
Bud, please!

1001
01:38:43,006 --> 01:38:44,925
This is insane.

1002
01:38:45,008 --> 01:38:47,344
- Oh, my God. I know.
- You okay?

1003
01:38:47,469 --> 01:38:49,346
It's the only way.

1004
01:38:49,471 --> 01:38:51,849
Here, hold this.

1005
01:38:54,351 --> 01:38:56,353
- Just hold on.
- Okay.

1006
01:38:58,522 --> 01:39:01,692
You can do this, you know.

1007
01:39:05,112 --> 01:39:07,030
You can do this.

1008
01:39:07,114 --> 01:39:09,032
- Oh, God, Linds, I...
- I know.

1009
01:39:09,116 --> 01:39:11,034
You can tell me later.

1010
01:39:19,877 --> 01:39:22,004
<i>Oh, God!</i>

1011
01:39:22,129 --> 01:39:24,047
<i>Oh, God!</i>

1012
01:39:28,135 --> 01:39:31,054
This is maybe not
such a good idea!

1013
01:39:31,138 --> 01:39:34,183
Oh, my God!

1014
01:39:34,308 --> 01:39:37,644
Bud! Ohh!

1015
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:49,907
I can't...
Help, Bud! I'm scared!

1016
01:40:20,437 --> 01:40:23,440
No!

1017
01:40:46,922 --> 01:40:49,508
<i>I got him!
I got him!</i>

1018
01:40:49,633 --> 01:40:51,510
- Where?
- Oh, my God. It's Lindsey.

1019
01:40:51,635 --> 01:40:54,138
<i>- Deep Core, do you read? Over,
- We got you, Bud.</i>

1020
01:40:54,263 --> 01:40:56,932
<i>- We're here,
- Go to the infirmary.</i>

1021
01:40:57,057 --> 01:41:00,561
Get the cart oxygen,
defib kit,

1022
01:41:00,644 --> 01:41:04,565
adrenaline and a 10cc syringe,
some heating blankets.

1023
01:41:04,648 --> 01:41:06,567
- You got all that?
- Got it. Over.

1024
01:41:06,650 --> 01:41:09,153
- Meet me at the moon pool!
Make it fast!
- Now! Let's go!

1025
01:41:09,278 --> 01:41:12,281
- Hippy, get the hot packs.
- Got 'em.

1026
01:41:29,673 --> 01:41:31,300
Here he comes!

1027
01:41:36,722 --> 01:41:38,932
- Get her up.
- Watch her head.

1028
01:41:39,016 --> 01:41:41,435
- I got it. I got it.
- Watch her feet.

1029
01:41:44,438 --> 01:41:48,192
Watch her head comin' down.
Watch it. Okay.

1030
01:41:53,030 --> 01:41:56,033
Clear that.
Is she clear? Is she clear?

1031
01:41:56,158 --> 01:41:58,660
Get the defib ready.
Hurry up, Cat.

1032
01:41:58,785 --> 01:42:00,704
Okay, okay. Got it.

1033
01:42:02,039 --> 01:42:04,249
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1034
01:42:04,374 --> 01:42:06,919
Three-one thousand,
four-one thousand,

1035
01:42:07,044 --> 01:42:09,421
- five-one thousand...
- Breathe!

1036
01:42:09,546 --> 01:42:12,424
One-one thousand, two-one thousand,
three-one thousand...

1037
01:42:12,549 --> 01:42:15,928
No, no, no. You gotta
have bare skin or it won't work.

1038
01:42:16,053 --> 01:42:18,931
Three-one thousand,
four-one thousand... Breathe.

1039
01:42:19,056 --> 01:42:21,058
Here.

1040
01:42:21,183 --> 01:42:23,060
Is that right?
Is this it?

1041
01:42:23,185 --> 01:42:25,062
- I got it, Bud.
- Well, do it!

1042
01:42:25,187 --> 01:42:27,064
<i>Breathe!</i>

1043
01:42:27,189 --> 01:42:29,733
- Come on, zap her.
- Clear!

1044
01:42:29,858 --> 01:42:32,736
Come on, baby. Aw, Christ!

1045
01:42:32,861 --> 01:42:35,280
<i>- Nothing.
- Breathe!</i>

1046
01:42:35,405 --> 01:42:38,617

- All right, do it again, One Night.

1047
01:42:38,742 --> 01:42:41,995
- Zap her again.
- It's going, it's going. It's charging.

1048
01:42:42,079 --> 01:42:45,833
Charging. Charging. Charging.

1049
01:42:45,916 --> 01:42:47,459
- Now.
- Clear!

1050

<i>- Anything?
- No pulse,</i>

1051

1052
01:42:53,257 --> 01:42:56,844
Zap her again. Come on!

- Clear!

1054
01:43:02,266 --> 01:43:03,892
God! No pulse.

1055
01:43:03,976 --> 01:43:06,145
Bud, it's flat.
Goddamn, it's flat.

1056
01:43:08,605 --> 01:43:11,942
One, two, three, four, five,
one thousand.

1057
01:43:12,025 --> 01:43:14,945
One-one thousand,
two-one thousand... Breathe.

1058
01:43:15,028 --> 01:43:18,323
One, two, three, four...
Breathe!

1059
01:43:24,663 --> 01:43:26,790
Breathe. Come on, baby.

1060
01:43:26,915 --> 01:43:28,709
One-one thousand,
two-one thousand,

1061
01:43:28,792 --> 01:43:31,587
three-one thousand,
four-one thousand...

1062
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:33,839
Come on, baby.
One-one thousand, two-one thousand,

1063
01:43:33,964 --> 01:43:36,300
three-one thousand,
four-one thousand, five-one thou...

1064
01:43:36,383 --> 01:43:38,427
Come on, baby, breathe.
Come on.

1065
01:43:38,510 --> 01:43:41,430
- Two-one thousand, three-one thousand...
- Bud. Bud.

1066
01:43:41,513 --> 01:43:43,932
Bud? Bud.

1067
01:43:45,767 --> 01:43:47,811
It's all over, man.

1068
01:43:50,105 --> 01:43:52,316
It's all over.

1069
01:43:52,441 --> 01:43:54,651
I'm sorry.

1070
01:43:54,776 --> 01:43:56,653
No pulse.

1071
01:44:18,926 --> 01:44:21,762
No! No!
She has a strong heart!

1072
01:44:21,845 --> 01:44:23,764
She wants to live!

1073
01:44:23,847 --> 01:44:26,058
Come on, Linds!
Come on, baby!

1074
01:44:59,508 --> 01:45:01,385
Zap her again. Do it!

1075
01:45:01,510 --> 01:45:03,387
- Charging.
- Do it!

1076
01:45:09,226 --> 01:45:11,103
<i>- Come on, baby.
- Clear.</i>

1077
01:45:11,228 --> 01:45:13,772
Clear!

1078
01:45:13,897 --> 01:45:16,233
Get back.

1079
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:25,617
Come on, breathe, baby.

1080
01:45:25,742 --> 01:45:27,619
Goddamn it, breathe.

1081
01:45:27,744 --> 01:45:30,706
Goddamn it, you bitch! You never
backed away from anything in your life!

1082
01:45:30,831 --> 01:45:33,584
Now fight!
Fight! Fight!

1083
01:45:33,667 --> 01:45:36,295
Right now! Do it!

1084
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:38,297
Fight, goddamn it!

1085
01:45:39,423 --> 01:45:42,926
Fight! Fight! Fight!

1086
01:45:43,051 --> 01:45:46,472
Fight!

1087
01:45:51,602 --> 01:45:54,229
Linds. That's it, Lindsey.

1088
01:45:54,313 --> 01:45:56,273
That's it, Linds.
You can do it.

1089
01:45:56,398 --> 01:46:00,277
That's it, Linds. Come on back.
You can do it, baby.

1090
01:46:02,779 --> 01:46:04,656
Lindsey.

1091
01:46:09,077 --> 01:46:10,954
Okay.

1092
01:46:11,079 --> 01:46:13,957
Get her some air. Get her some air.

1093
01:46:14,082 --> 01:46:15,959
- Easy. Breathe easy.
- Look at that.

1094
01:46:16,084 --> 01:46:19,004
<i>All right. All right.</i>

1095
01:46:19,129 --> 01:46:21,965
You did it, ace! Huh?

1096
01:46:27,054 --> 01:46:28,972
Yeah! Yeah!

1097
01:46:30,891 --> 01:46:32,810
You did it, babe.

1098
01:46:32,893 --> 01:46:34,812
Easy. Breathe easy.

1099
01:46:34,895 --> 01:46:39,274
Watch her... Make sure...
Make sure her heart's doin' okay.

1100
01:46:56,041 --> 01:46:58,961
Big boys don't cry.
Remember?

1101
01:47:04,758 --> 01:47:06,802
Hi, lady.

1102
01:47:07,928 --> 01:47:09,972
Hi, tough guy.

1103
01:47:13,559 --> 01:47:17,062
- I guess it worked, didn't it?
- Yeah, of course it did.

1104
01:47:18,856 --> 01:47:20,691
You're never wrong, are you?

1105
01:47:23,485 --> 01:47:26,155
How you feelin'? Huh?

1106
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:28,198
I've felt better.

1107
01:47:28,282 --> 01:47:31,827
What did you do to me?

1108
01:47:37,374 --> 01:47:39,835
Next time it's your turn. Okay?

1109
01:47:39,918 --> 01:47:42,379
Yeah.

1110
01:47:42,504 --> 01:47:45,507
Yeah, you got that right.

1111
01:47:45,716 --> 01:47:49,011
Okay, these are so your eyes can focus
in the breathing fluid.

1112
01:47:49,094 --> 01:47:51,513
How's that feel?
There it is.

1113
01:47:51,597 --> 01:47:54,516
If you can't see, you can't
disarm the bomb. Right?

1114
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:58,395
Okay, with this much weight
you're gonna fall like a brick.

1115
01:47:58,479 --> 01:48:02,649
We still got about an hour, so
we should get there in plenty of time.

1116
01:48:02,733 --> 01:48:05,652
When you get down there,
all you gotta do is cut one wire,

1117
01:48:05,736 --> 01:48:08,655
drop the weights
and come on home.

1118
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:14,077
<i>- Hand me that wrench, will ya?
- Maybe I oughta check and see...</i>

1119
01:48:14,203 --> 01:48:17,414
<i>Uh, yeah, that's a good place,</i>

1120
01:48:17,539 --> 01:48:20,709
This is loose.
I'll fix that up.

1121
01:48:20,793 --> 01:48:23,837
Bud, you don't
have to do this.

1122
01:48:25,005 --> 01:48:26,924
Somebody's gotta do it.

1123
01:48:27,007 --> 01:48:28,926
It doesn't have to be you.

1124
01:48:29,009 --> 01:48:31,637
Who, then?

1125
01:48:35,557 --> 01:48:37,434
So, I... I can hear you,

1126
01:48:37,559 --> 01:48:39,436
but I can't talk, right?

1127
01:48:39,561 --> 01:48:42,439
The fluid prevents the larynx
from making sound... Excuse me.

1128
01:48:42,564 --> 01:48:45,442
- It'll feel a little strange.
- Yeah, no shit.

1129
01:48:45,567 --> 01:48:49,112
I gotta warn you all...
I'm a pretty lousy typist.

1130
01:48:51,281 --> 01:48:54,743
The moment of truth.

1131
01:48:55,994 --> 01:48:57,913
- Come on. Let's go.
- Let's go.

1132
01:48:57,996 --> 01:48:59,915
Okay. Easy.

1133
01:48:59,998 --> 01:49:02,417
Okay.

1134
01:49:02,501 --> 01:49:05,420
I need it in the front
a little bit. Thank you.

1135
01:49:05,504 --> 01:49:07,965
Got it.

1136
01:49:08,090 --> 01:49:09,925
<i>- Set.
- Set,</i>

1137
01:49:10,008 --> 01:49:11,927
<i>- Clamp,
- Set.</i>

1138
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:24,148
Okay, let's rock and roll.

1139
01:49:24,273 --> 01:49:26,692
Crack it.

1140
01:49:26,817 --> 01:49:29,194
Headset. Headset, please.

1141
01:49:30,529 --> 01:49:33,323
- Okay?
- Relax now, Bud. Just relax.

1142
01:49:34,825 --> 01:49:37,703
<i>- Bud. Watch me.
- Relax now, Bud,</i>

1143
01:49:37,828 --> 01:49:40,205
<i>- Relax, It's okay,
- Okay? Watch me. Watch me.</i>

1144
01:49:40,330 --> 01:49:42,624
<i>Don't hold your breath,
Take it in,</i>

1145
01:49:42,708 --> 01:49:45,502
Just let yourself take it in.
Take it in.

1146
01:49:47,087 --> 01:49:49,006
<i>- That's it,
- Oh, man,</i>

1147
01:49:49,089 --> 01:49:52,342
<i>Don't hold your breath, Take it in,
There you go, Don't hold your breath,</i>

1148
01:49:52,468 --> 01:49:54,720
<i>Take it in,
That's it, There you go,</i>

1149
01:49:54,845 --> 01:49:58,182
Bud... This is not normal!

1150
01:49:58,307 --> 01:50:01,685
This is normal. It'll pass
in a second. It's perfectly normal.

1151
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:03,687
It's perfectly normal.

1152
01:50:03,812 --> 01:50:07,691
We all breathed liquid for nine months,
Bud. Your body will remember.

1153
01:50:07,774 --> 01:50:10,694
That's it. That's it.

1154
01:50:10,777 --> 01:50:13,822
<i>- Perfectly normal,
- Christ, he's breathin'it,</i>

1155
01:50:13,906 --> 01:50:15,908
Give me that.

1156
01:50:16,033 --> 01:50:17,910
Can you hear me?

1157
01:50:18,035 --> 01:50:19,912
<i>- There he goes, He's got it,
- Yes. Yes.</i>

1158
01:50:20,037 --> 01:50:21,872
- Okay, Bud.
- That's it.

1159
01:50:21,997 --> 01:50:24,374
Try your key pad.

1160
01:50:35,636 --> 01:50:37,554
<i>Right,</i>

1161
01:50:38,972 --> 01:50:40,891
I already have.

1162
01:50:44,394 --> 01:50:47,147
Okay, let's go.

1163
01:50:47,231 --> 01:50:49,650
- Okay.
- That's okay. I got it.

1164
01:50:50,734 --> 01:50:53,362
<i>I got it,</i>

1165
01:50:53,487 --> 01:50:56,114
<i>- Okay, Hippy, you got that?
- Hold on, Jammer,</i>

1166
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:58,116
<i>- Okay, Bud.
- Easy, Easy,</i>

1167
01:50:58,242 --> 01:51:01,119
<i>Watch out, Watch the back,</i>

1168
01:51:02,412 --> 01:51:04,289
Careful.

1169
01:51:05,791 --> 01:51:10,087
I rigged in Little Geek's chip
the same as Big Geek.

1170
01:51:10,170 --> 01:51:12,089
It should take you
straight there.

1171
01:51:12,172 --> 01:51:15,759
All you have to do
is hang on.

1172
01:53:01,281 --> 01:53:04,201
- What's his depth?
- Thirty-two hundred feet.

1173
01:53:04,284 --> 01:53:06,203
Your depth is 3,200 feet.

1174
01:53:06,328 --> 01:53:08,205
You're doing fine.

1175
01:53:08,330 --> 01:53:12,376
You'd better watch out for crane
wreckage. You should be almost to it.

1176
01:53:22,970 --> 01:53:25,013
Forty-eight hundred feet.
It's official.

1177
01:53:25,139 --> 01:53:27,057
Yeah.

1178
01:53:27,141 --> 01:53:30,936
Bud, according to Monk here, you just
set a record for the deepest suit dive.

1179
01:53:31,061 --> 01:53:34,898
Bet you didn't think you'd be doing
this when you got up this morning, huh?

1180
01:53:43,740 --> 01:53:46,785
One mile down.
Still grinnin'.

1181
01:54:02,468 --> 01:54:04,386
Eighty-five hundred feet.

1182
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:07,931
Eighty-five hundred feet, Bud.

1183
01:54:08,056 --> 01:54:09,933
Everything okay?

1184
01:54:11,727 --> 01:54:13,604
Ask him about
pressure effects...

1185
01:54:13,729 --> 01:54:15,606
tremors, vision problems, euphoria.

1186
01:54:17,441 --> 01:54:19,902
Ensign Monk wants to know
how you feel.

1187
01:54:31,330 --> 01:54:34,291
It's starting.
It hits the nervous system first.

1188
01:54:35,417 --> 01:54:37,503
Keep talking.
Let him hear your voice.

1189
01:54:37,628 --> 01:54:40,714
Okay, Bud, your depth is 8,900 feet.
You're doing fine.

1190
01:54:40,798 --> 01:54:43,342
No, Lindsey.

1191
01:54:43,467 --> 01:54:45,469
<i>Talk to him.</i>

1192
01:54:51,725 --> 01:54:53,644
Bud.

1193
01:54:54,812 --> 01:54:56,730
There are some...

1194
01:54:56,814 --> 01:54:58,732
some things I need to say.

1195
01:55:00,025 --> 01:55:02,069
It's hard for me, you know.

1196
01:55:03,529 --> 01:55:06,615
It's not easy
being a cast-iron bitch.

1197
01:55:06,698 --> 01:55:09,618
Takes discipline
and years of training.

1198
01:55:10,869 --> 01:55:12,788
A lot of people
don't appreciate that.

1199
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:20,212
Jesus, I'm sorry I can't
tell you these things to your face.

1200
01:55:20,337 --> 01:55:21,630
I have to wait till
you're alone in the dark,

1201
01:55:23,257 --> 01:55:27,177
freezing, and there's 10,000 feet
of water between us.

1202
01:55:27,261 --> 01:55:29,346
Comin' up on
the big ten thou.

1203
01:55:36,186 --> 01:55:39,231
Twelve thousand feet.
Jesus, I don't believe he's doin' this!

1204
01:55:39,356 --> 01:55:42,276
Hippy!
Shut up! What's wrong with you?

1205
01:55:46,947 --> 01:55:48,824
Bud, how are you doing?

1206
01:55:53,495 --> 01:55:54,496
Bud?

1207
01:55:58,625 --> 01:56:01,170
He's losing it.
Talk to him.

1208
01:56:01,295 --> 01:56:04,214
<i>- Keep him with us.
- Coming up on 16,000,</i>

1209
01:56:04,298 --> 01:56:06,216
B-Bud, it's the pressure.
All right?

1210
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:09,511
Listen to my voice.
You have to try. Concentrate.

1211
01:56:09,636 --> 01:56:13,557
<i>All right?
Just listen to my voice, Please,</i>

1212
01:56:13,682 --> 01:56:15,559
Seventeen thousand feet.

1213
01:56:15,684 --> 01:56:18,520
Christ Almighty,
this is insane.

1214
01:56:18,604 --> 01:56:21,356
Bud... I'm not getting anything.

1215
01:56:26,653 --> 01:56:29,072
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa... Oh, come on. No. No.
- What? What?</i>

1216
01:56:29,156 --> 01:56:31,074
Little Geek just folded.

1217
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:33,076
Jesus.

1218
01:57:22,167 --> 01:57:24,545
He can still make it.

1219
01:57:29,466 --> 01:57:31,885
Bud,

1220
01:57:31,969 --> 01:57:33,887
I know how alone you feel.

1221
01:57:36,014 --> 01:57:39,977
Alone in all that
cold blackness.

1222
01:57:43,230 --> 01:57:46,108
<i>But I'm there in the dark
with you,</i>

1223
01:57:46,233 --> 01:57:48,110
<i>Oh, Bud, you're not alone,</i>

1224
01:57:53,073 --> 01:57:54,992
I'm with you.

1225
01:57:55,075 --> 01:57:58,078
I'll always be with you, Bud.
I promise that.

1226
01:58:11,467 --> 01:58:14,720
How you doin', partner?

1227
01:58:14,803 --> 01:58:17,723
You still with us?
Come back.

1228
01:58:17,806 --> 01:58:20,392
You talk to us, Buddy boy.

1229
01:58:20,476 --> 01:58:22,895
- Come on.
- Bud.

1230
01:58:22,978 --> 01:58:25,898
Bud? Now, come on.
You hangin' in there?

1231
01:58:27,274 --> 01:58:30,152
You have to talk to me, Bud.
Please.

1232
01:58:30,277 --> 01:58:31,737
I need to know
if you're okay.

1233
01:58:46,919 --> 01:58:49,296
<i>You see... You see a light?</i>

1234
01:58:49,379 --> 01:58:52,883
What kind of light, Bud?

1235
01:58:53,008 --> 01:58:55,886
He's hallucinating badly.

1236
01:59:16,907 --> 01:59:20,577
<i>- He made it,
- Oh, my God.</i>

1237
01:59:20,702 --> 01:59:22,579
Oh, man.

1238
01:59:23,997 --> 01:59:27,417
Okay, Bud,
we'll go step by step.

1239
01:59:27,543 --> 01:59:30,671
Remove the detonator housing...

1240
01:59:30,754 --> 01:59:34,049
by unscrewing it counterclockwise.

1241
02:00:04,413 --> 02:00:08,792
All right, Bud,
you have to cut the ground wire,

1242
02:00:08,917 --> 02:00:11,253
not the lead wire.

1243
02:00:11,336 --> 02:00:13,422
It's the blue wire
with the white stripe.

1244
02:00:13,547 --> 02:00:15,966
<i>Not... I repeat...</i>

1245
02:00:16,049 --> 02:00:19,928
<i>not the black wire
with the yellow stripe,</i>

1246
02:01:15,901 --> 02:01:18,737
- Yes!
- Quiet! Quiet. Save your air.

1247
02:01:18,862 --> 02:01:21,490
Bud, give me a reading
off your liquid oxygen gauge.

1248
02:01:29,039 --> 02:01:31,917
What?

1249
02:01:32,042 --> 02:01:35,212
- It took him 30 minutes
just to get down there!
- Bud, do you hear me?

1250
02:01:35,337 --> 02:01:39,216
You drop your weights and start back
now, Bud! That gauge could be wrong!

1251
02:01:39,341 --> 02:01:43,178
Do you hear me? Just drop
your weights and start back now.

1252
02:01:43,262 --> 02:01:46,473
Your gauge could be wrong!
Your gauge could be wrong!

1253
02:01:46,557 --> 02:01:49,560
You drop your weights
and start back now!

1254
02:01:52,646 --> 02:01:55,858
<i>No, you won't stay there!
Do you hear me? You drop your weights,</i>

1255
02:01:55,983 --> 02:01:58,485
You can breathe shallow!
Do you hear me?

1256
02:01:58,569 --> 02:02:01,446
Bud, please! Listen to me,
please! Goddamn it!

1257
02:02:01,572 --> 02:02:06,118
You dragged me
back from the bottomless pit!
You can't leave me here alone now!

1258
02:02:06,243 --> 02:02:09,872
Please.
Oh, God, Virgil, please.

1259
02:02:09,955 --> 02:02:12,374
Please.

1260
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:54,958
I love you.

1261
02:08:00,931 --> 02:08:02,933
Howdy.

1262
02:08:03,016 --> 02:08:06,019
Uh, how you guys doin'?

1263
02:09:25,182 --> 02:09:28,060
<i>Deep Core, do you
read? This is Benthic Explorer. Over,</i>

1264
02:09:28,143 --> 02:09:30,896
Do you hear, Deep Core?

1265
02:09:31,021 --> 02:09:34,608
Deep Core, do you read?
Do you read me, Deep Core?

1266
02:09:36,944 --> 02:09:41,949
<i>Deep Core, do you read?
This is Benthic Explorer. Over,</i>

1267
02:09:42,074 --> 02:09:44,535
Hell, yes, we read.
Good of you to join us.

1268
02:09:44,660 --> 02:09:49,039
- Copy, Deep Core. Hey, I've got 'em!
- How's that storm up there?

1269
02:09:49,123 --> 02:09:51,917
It's strange. It just blew
itself out all of a sudden.

1270
02:09:52,042 --> 02:09:55,420
Hell, son, you better get
a line down to us.

1271
02:09:55,504 --> 02:09:59,883
<i>We're in moderately
poor shape down here,
We lost seven people, includin'Bud,</i>

1272
02:09:59,967 --> 02:10:03,971
<i>And we're about out of O-2, so whatever
you're gonna do, you better do it fast,</i>

1273
02:10:03,971 --> 02:10:04,471
<i>And we're about out of O-2, so whatever
you're gonna do, you better do it fast,</i>

1274
02:10:05,931 --> 02:10:08,559
<i>You boys make up your mind
how to get us out of here yet?</i>

1275
02:10:08,642 --> 02:10:11,145
They're talking about flying
in a D.S.R.V. From Norfolk.

1276
02:10:11,228 --> 02:10:14,231
<i>You'll come into Guantanamo
on a C-133,</i>

1277
02:10:14,314 --> 02:10:16,817
Okay, I understand it,
but how long is it gonna take...

1278
02:10:16,942 --> 02:10:20,279
Hey. Hey. Hey, it's Bud!

1279
02:10:20,404 --> 02:10:23,449
That's impossible.

1280
02:10:23,574 --> 02:10:26,952
<i>- Do you read me,
Deep Core? Do you hear?
- No, it's not.</i>

1281
02:10:27,077 --> 02:10:32,332
- Yes!
- W-Wait. We got a message from Bud.

1282
02:10:32,458 --> 02:10:35,252
- Bud?
- What's it say?

1283
02:10:35,335 --> 02:10:38,714
Here. Here.

1284
02:10:38,839 --> 02:10:42,426
It says, " Virgil Brigman
back on the air. "

1285
02:10:42,509 --> 02:10:45,012
<i>Yes!</i>

1286
02:10:53,145 --> 02:10:55,689
"Have some new friends
down here. "

1287
02:11:04,364 --> 02:11:06,742
What the hell's goin' on?

1288
02:11:06,867 --> 02:11:10,913
- One Night, get to sonar.
- Good God Almighty.

1289
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:16,376
Fellas, I'm gettin' some
awful big readings here.

1290
02:11:16,502 --> 02:11:19,213
- Something's coming up the wall.
- What is it?

1291
02:11:19,338 --> 02:11:22,049
Whatever it is, it's major!

1292
02:11:41,568 --> 02:11:44,988
Something's definitely
going on down there.

1293
02:11:45,072 --> 02:11:48,867
Active is pinging back
something really big. It's huge.

1294
02:11:48,992 --> 02:11:51,537
- And it's coming up right underneath us.
- Where?

1295
02:11:51,662 --> 02:11:53,038
Where? It's everywhere.
There! Starboard bow.

1296
02:11:58,877 --> 02:12:00,879
<i>This is the Benthic Explorer,</i>

1297
02:13:17,748 --> 02:13:20,000
There! Look! Look!

1298
02:13:33,096 --> 02:13:34,973
Help, Cat.

1299
02:14:02,543 --> 02:14:05,921
We should be dead.
We didn't decompress.

1300
02:14:08,048 --> 02:14:10,843
They must've done something to us.

1301
02:14:12,719 --> 02:14:16,849
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think
you could say that.

1302
02:14:42,875 --> 02:14:46,503
Ha! Hoo!

1303
02:15:06,857 --> 02:15:08,734
Hi, Brigman.

1304
02:15:10,027 --> 02:15:12,237
Hi, Mrs. Brigman.
