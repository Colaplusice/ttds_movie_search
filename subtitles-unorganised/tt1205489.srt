1
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:14,477
God, I am sorry for Dorothy, Walt.
She was a real peach.

2
00:01:14,562 --> 00:01:17,645
Thanks for coming, Al.

3
00:01:45,318 --> 00:01:48,361
Spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch.

4
00:01:55,764 --> 00:01:58,827
Look at the Old Man glaring at Ashley.

5
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,244
He can?t even tone it
down at Mom?s funeral?

6
00:02:02,662 --> 00:02:05,921
What do you expect? Dad?s still
living in the ?50s.

7
00:02:05,922 --> 00:02:08,556
He expects his granddaughter to dress a
little more modestly.

8
00:02:08,557 --> 00:02:11,023
Yeah, well your kid?s wearing
a Timberwolves jersey.

9
00:02:11,024 --> 00:02:12,494
I?m sure Dad appreciates that.

10
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:14,443
The point I am trying to make is that there?

11
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:17,013
s nothing anyone can do that
won?t disappoint the Old Man.

12
00:02:17,014 --> 00:02:19,376
It?s inevitable.

13
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:23,907
That?s why we stopped doing Thanksgivings.

14
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:27,524
the deal with the boat motor, the
broken bird bath,

15
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,468
It?s always something.

16
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:30,948
What are we going to do with him?

17
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:33,336
Don?t you think he?ll get in trouble over

18
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:36,015
there all by himself in
the old neighborhood?

19
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:40,857
Why don?t you have him move in with you?

20
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:07,873
Death is often a bittersweet
occasion to us Catholics.

21
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:10,378
Bitter in the pain.

22
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,599
Sweet in the salvation.

23
00:03:13,684 --> 00:03:17,759
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased.

24
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:19,978
... and their families

25
00:03:20,064 --> 00:03:25,966
Sweet to those who know the salvation that
awaits.

26
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:29,933
And some may ask,
what is death?

27
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:32,667
Is it the end?

28
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:35,331
Or is it the beginning?

29
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:37,704
And what is life?

30
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:40,480
What is this thing we call life?

31
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:45,188
All these questions can frustrate you at
times like this.

32
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:48,306
And that's why you have to turn to the Lord.
- Jesus ...

33
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:52,282
Because the Lord is the sweetness.

34
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:10,406
Is that dad?
- No, that's grandpa Walt.

35
00:04:10,493 --> 00:04:14,413
There is a platoon, E-Company,
March 2, 1952.

36
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,522
Korea?
- Where's Korea?

37
00:04:21,434 --> 00:04:23,563
Well, people showed up after
the service, huh?

38
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:26,363
Yeah, well, I suppose they heard
there?d be a lot of ham.

39
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:28,557
I?ll go down the basement and get some
chairs.

40
00:04:28,642 --> 00:04:30,753
Oh, I can do that, Dad..
- No, we need them now

41
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:33,753
not next week.

42
00:04:37,464 --> 00:04:40,717
Cool, I found a medal.
Look at this.

43
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,975
How much longer do we have to stay?

44
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,151
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell
and I?m bored.

45
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:10,838
Ashley, honey. Why don?t you help
Grandpa Walt with the chairs?

46
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:13,808
Me?
- Yes, you.

47
00:05:15,694 --> 00:05:20,128
Grandpa Walt, would you like some help with
these four chairs.

48
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:24,649
No, you probably just painted your nails.

49
00:05:27,784 --> 00:05:30,929
Your dad is driving me crazy.

50
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:36,524
Why didn't you guys make him a hint we're
leaving soon?

51
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,179
Come on, let's go.

52
00:06:09,094 --> 00:06:12,917
Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats
can get in one room?

53
00:06:31,823 --> 00:06:35,444
Grandpa, when?d you get the
vintage car??

54
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,703
1972.

55
00:06:42,057 --> 00:06:44,186
I never knew you had a cool old car.

56
00:06:44,272 --> 00:06:49,170
Yeah, it's been here since
before you were born.

57
00:06:49,793 --> 00:06:54,136
So, what are you going do with it when you
like...

58
00:06:54,222 --> 00:06:58,203
die?

59
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,031
Then what about that super cool
retro couch that you have in the den

60
00:07:07,032 --> 00:07:08,943
Cause I was thinking I?m going
to State next year,

61
00:07:08,944 --> 00:07:12,096
and I think it would look really
good in my dorm room.

62
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:14,373
And I don't have any furniture at all.

63
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:22,776
God.

64
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,284
Who are you? - Hi, I am Tao. - What do you
want?

65
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:30,312
I live next door.
- Come on, get the shit out of your mouth.

66
00:07:30,313 --> 00:07:31,542
I am ...
- Tell me what you want.

67
00:07:31,543 --> 00:07:34,054
Do you have jumper cables? My
uncle?s car is old and.....

68
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:35,553
- No we don't any jumper cables .

69
00:07:35,638 --> 00:07:40,027
And have some respect, zipper head, we?re
mourning  here..

70
00:07:41,313 --> 00:07:43,221
How you holding up, Walt?

71
00:07:43,307 --> 00:07:45,147
Mr. Kowalski.

72
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:49,617
Huh?
- Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.

73
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:52,319
Right, Mr. Kowalski.

74
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:55,219
Your wife and I became quite close these
last few months.

75
00:07:55,305 --> 00:07:58,009
She asked that I
watch over you when she passed on.

76
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,806
I told her I watch out for my
entire flock.

77
00:07:59,807 --> 00:08:02,991
But she made me promise I?d keep an extra
sharp eye on you.

78
00:08:03,078 --> 00:08:06,001
I appreciate your kindness you've shown to
my wife.

79
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:07,762
Now that you?ve spoken your piece,

80
00:08:07,763 --> 00:08:10,226
why don?t go and attend
some of your other sheep?

81
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:12,082
Ok?

82
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:16,748
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was
her desire for you to go to confession.

83
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:19,295
She said she couldn?t remember the last time
you went.

84
00:08:19,381 --> 00:08:22,382
Is that so?
- It is.

85
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:26,400
Well, I confess that I never really cared
for church very much.

86
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:28,848
The only reason I went was because of her.

87
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:31,325
And I confess that I have no
desire to confess

88
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:35,028
to a boy that is
just out of the seminary.

89
00:09:07,404 --> 00:09:11,356
Wish I could help dad, but gotta get kids
home.

90
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:14,520
Kids getting restless.
- Yeah, fine, just go.

91
00:09:14,607 --> 00:09:18,317
I?ll call in a few, see how you?re doing.
- Alright.

92
00:09:21,948 --> 00:09:24,530
Kill you to buy American.

93
00:09:24,615 --> 00:09:26,834
Huh ...

94
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,819
Did you see the way he looked at the truck?

95
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:31,988
Jesus. It?s always Rice-Burner this or
Jap-Burner that. You know.

96
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,851
Even at Mom?s funeral, he can?t let it go.

97
00:09:33,852 --> 00:09:36,460
At least he didn?t say anything this time.
-He didn?t need to.

98
00:09:36,461 --> 00:09:39,699
Well, what do you expect, Mitch? The man
worked at a Ford plant for a lot of years.

99
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,070
I suppose that?s my goddamned fault?

100
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:43,150
Just give it a rest. Drive. Ok?

101
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:47,489
Kids, do you want the radio on? Yes.
You want to listen to some music? Good.

102
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,052
Damn, barbarians

103
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:46,364
Oh, Jesus ...

104
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:51,367
Polarski would roll over in his grave if he
could see his lawn now.

105
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:55,767
What the hell the chinks had to move in
this neighborhood for?

106
00:12:22,748 --> 00:12:25,961
Have you gone completely deaf or something??

107
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:30,052
Hi there, Walt.

108
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:34,153
I kind of not a friend of yours.
Why do you insist on calling me Walt?

109
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:36,606
Sorry , Mr.Kowalski.

110
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:40,401
What are you peddling today, padre?
- Nothing.

111
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:41,915
Thought I?d drop by and
see how you are doing.

112
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,232
I haven?t seen you in church in a while

113
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:45,109
Okay. Well now when you
tipped on your good deed,

114
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,910
now why don?t you just
take off down the road?

115
00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:50,937
I?d really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.

116
00:12:51,024 --> 00:12:52,203
Why?

117
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,637
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
- You don't want to know.

118
00:12:54,638 --> 00:12:56,590
No, I do.

119
00:12:56,675 --> 00:13:00,369
Well I think you?re an  overeducated,
27-year-old virgin

120
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:03,464
who likes to  hold the hands of old ladies
who are superstitious

121
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,707
and promises them eternity.

122
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:27,127
Is you a boy or is you a girl, I can?t
tell

123
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,777
Hey, Chicito.  If you was in pink, I would
fuck you and your ass would be my bitch.

124
00:13:31,862 --> 00:13:34,042
What you reading, jackass
and The rice stalk?

125
00:13:34,128 --> 00:13:38,050
That?s right, you keep walking.

126
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:42,743
Look at me when I am talking to you.
-Fucking slopes everywhere you look, man.

127
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:46,634
Fucking pigs

128
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:49,369
Look at that, man.

129
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:58,201
That's my little cousin, over there.
- You sure that's your cousin, man?

130
00:13:58,288 --> 00:14:01,426
Fuck yes, that's my little cousin.
- He tight with anybody?

131
00:14:01,513 --> 00:14:03,811
No he is flying solo, man.
- Flying solo?

132
00:14:03,897 --> 00:14:07,409
Let's go down and see what the fucking
they're doing to him.

133
00:14:13,614 --> 00:14:16,380
I love your jungles too.

134
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:19,663
Hey, they fucking with you?

135
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:23,448
They fucking with you?

136
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:26,047
We can do this right now.

137
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:27,772
You go fucking back here, don't you?

138
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:29,906
Yeah!

139
00:14:30,092 --> 00:14:33,961
You are fucking rise niggers!

140
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:43,072
Ok go!

141
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:52,148
Tao, come on man, get in the car.

142
00:14:52,234 --> 00:14:55,684
Dog, get in the car.

143
00:14:58,114 --> 00:15:00,388
We just bailed your ass out, dawg.

144
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:03,680
Come on, dawg, get the fuck in here.

145
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:05,680
Get in the car, man, come on.

146
00:15:05,766 --> 00:15:08,038
Chill with us, man.

147
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:11,313
We just bailed your ass out!

148
00:15:11,398 --> 00:15:12,613
Come on.

149
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:19,242
Come on, Tao, man.
- Fuck him, man, let's go.

150
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:21,201
Come on Spider.
- Fuck it.

151
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:22,965
Get it man, let's go.
fuck his ass.

152
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:26,107
Tomorrow, I have to see your ass.

153
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,211
- Don't be like a little girl!
Tomorrow.

154
00:15:28,297 --> 00:15:31,454
Come let's go, man. We've got a gun, man.

155
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,302
Let's get the fuck out of here. Let's get
this strapped.

156
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,057
Pussy!

157
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:50,141
Hey, Tao.

158
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:56,135
Hey what's up?

159
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,746
What's up, Tao?

160
00:16:00,935 --> 00:16:03,280
What are you doing little man?

161
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:05,781
Why are you doing woman's work?

162
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:07,882
What do you want?

163
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,671
What? We can't just come and talk to my
little cousin?

164
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:15,177
He doesn't want to talk to you.

165
00:16:15,263 --> 00:16:17,554
I am here right.
- Hey, Spider, who is that?

166
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,281
What's up?
- Spider?

167
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:22,056
Is that what he just
called you, Fong?

168
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:26,264
Spider?
- Is there something wrong with Spider?

169
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:28,250
What are you doing here?

170
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:30,185
Hey, so how old are you anyways?

171
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:33,770
Mentally, I am way too old for you.
- What?

172
00:16:33,857 --> 00:16:36,303
You are just stupid.
I am going inside.

173
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:38,921
Sue!

174
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:42,122
How your little brother, do this gardening.

175
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,981
Fine, stupid.

176
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:48,247
Hey, you will roll with us man, come on?

177
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:52,178
Come on ride with us.
- Chill with us.

178
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:55,397
You need somebody to protect you, man.
That's what your big cousins are for.

179
00:16:55,398 --> 00:16:58,147
Look, dawg. I've been there, I've done it
and I've seen it.

180
00:16:58,232 --> 00:17:00,521
Back in a day everybody wanted to beat me,
dawg.

181
00:17:00,608 --> 00:17:02,478
But now look, nobody wants to fuck with me.

182
00:17:02,508 --> 00:17:05,126
Come on man, let's go.
- We are cousins right?

183
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:07,524
Come on.
- We are cousins right?

184
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,087
We are a family.

185
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:13,492
Look, I am brother to Spider, as he is
brother to me.

186
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:16,614
Come on.
Take this shit off.

187
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,920
That's a woman's work man.
- Come get your hands dirty, man.

188
00:17:24,053 --> 00:17:26,692
So what do I have to do?

189
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:31,006
Spider told that old boy next door had a
bad ass whip.

190
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:34,459
Told you we got him.

191
00:17:34,545 --> 00:17:36,859
Come on.

192
00:17:37,044 --> 00:17:42,307
Nice.
- Ya, my little cousin being little man.

193
00:17:49,965 --> 00:17:52,333
Yo, that's a nice car.

194
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:56,766
1972 Gran Torino,  Fastback.

195
00:17:56,851 --> 00:18:00,524
Cobra jet engine.
- Yo man it can still in mint condition.

196
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:05,502
Yo man, it's in mint condition man.

197
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:08,277
I've got one.

198
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:11,910
A Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy go into
the bar.

199
00:18:11,996 --> 00:18:16,479
The bartender looks up and says:
"Get the fuck out of here!"

200
00:18:17,486 --> 00:18:20,723
So, here?s where my flock
congregates when they?re not in church..

201
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:23,743
Hey Father J.
- Hey, Mel. Hey, Darrel.

202
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:26,689
Hey father.
- Hi, Walt.

203
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:30,636
What brings you in here, father.
Meat raffle?

204
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:34,915
No, I just came down to talk
Walt if that's ok.

205
00:18:36,302 --> 00:18:40,411
Damn, padre.
You are persistent, aren't you?

206
00:18:40,498 --> 00:18:43,033
I promised your wife.

207
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:46,342
All right, let's get booze.

208
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:53,524
I'll have Pabst and a shot of Jack.
And whatever he's having.

209
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,730
I'll have a  Diet Coke.
- Bullshit. This is a bar. You have a drink.

210
00:18:57,817 --> 00:19:02,083
I'll have a  gin and tonic.
- Attaboy!

211
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:06,735
So, what you want?

212
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,653
I promised your wife I?d get you
to go to confession.

213
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:13,206
Now, why would you do that?
- She was very insistent.

214
00:19:13,293 --> 00:19:15,248
She made me.

215
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:19,137
Well you're kinda found of promising
things you can?t deliver on, right, father?

216
00:19:19,222 --> 00:19:21,819
Let?s talk about something else.
- What?

217
00:19:21,904 --> 00:19:23,994
Life and death.

218
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:28,980
Life and death. What the hell do you know
about life and death?

219
00:19:29,065 --> 00:19:30,885
I?d like to think I know a lot.

220
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:32,948
I?m a priest..

221
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:35,779
Yeah, you get up and preach about life and
death.

222
00:19:35,866 --> 00:19:38,723
But all what you know is what you learned
in a priest school.

223
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:41,922
Right out of the rookie Preacher's Handbook

224
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:43,998
I don't know about that. I think...

225
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:45,927
That is bittersweet.

226
00:19:46,013 --> 00:19:50,306
Sort of bitter in its pain. But
sweet in its salvation.

227
00:19:50,392 --> 00:19:54,448
That's what you know of life and death,
and that's pathetic.

228
00:19:54,534 --> 00:19:56,845
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?

229
00:19:56,931 --> 00:20:03,056
I know a lot. I lived there almost three
years in Korea. Thanks.

230
00:20:04,196 --> 00:20:05,370
We shot men.

231
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:11,888
We stabbed them with bayonets, hacked
seventeen-year-olds to death with shovels

232
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,627
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.

233
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:20,790
Horrible things,
but things I live with.

234
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:23,385
And what about life?

235
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:29,338
Well, I ...

236
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:32,070
I survived the war.

237
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:37,285
got married... and had a family.

238
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:41,669
Sounds like you know more about
death than you do living.

239
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,639
Maybe so, father.

240
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:52,946
Maybe so.

241
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:04,883
Son of a bitch.

242
00:21:58,647 --> 00:22:01,225
Hey, man, get in a car!
- Tao, what the fuck, get in!

243
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,348
Come on Tao.
- Come, let's go,man, get in!

244
00:22:03,434 --> 00:22:05,860
Fuck man, get in!

245
00:22:26,296 --> 00:22:27,500
Hello?

246
00:22:27,587 --> 00:22:30,137
Morning, Dad, it?s your number one
son, Mitch.

247
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:33,983
Morning? It's after one in the afternoon.
It's not morning.

248
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:37,835
Oh, right.
Afternoon, then.

249
00:22:38,807 --> 00:22:42,292
So what do you want?
- What?

250
00:22:42,788 --> 00:22:45,626
Me? Nothing. I mean, what would I want?

251
00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:50,866
Well, I don?t know. Your wife has already
gone through all of your mother?s jewelry.

252
00:22:51,858 --> 00:22:54,242
No, dad. I was just calling to see how are
you doing?

253
00:22:54,328 --> 00:22:57,371
Well, anything new with the old
neighborhood?

254
00:22:57,788 --> 00:23:02,239
No.
- Great. Smooth sailing then.

255
00:23:02,326 --> 00:23:05,370
Yah.
- Ok, good, good, then.

256
00:23:05,456 --> 00:23:08,733
Oh, hey, dead.
- Yeah.

257
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:14,266
You wouldn't happen to still know that guy
from the plant who has Lion season tickets?

258
00:23:18,379 --> 00:23:20,341
Dad?

259
00:23:51,155 --> 00:23:54,198
Ain't she sweet?

260
00:24:09,636 --> 00:24:11,937
Come on.

261
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:28,500
Hey, what's up?

262
00:24:28,586 --> 00:24:31,161
What are you doing here, man?
- Nothing.

263
00:24:31,248 --> 00:24:35,382
Minding our own business.
- Just hanging out.

264
00:24:35,831 --> 00:24:37,916
What are you guys doing here?

265
00:24:39,072 --> 00:24:40,574
What?

266
00:24:40,661 --> 00:24:43,700
Can I just come here to hang with my little
cousin?

267
00:24:47,982 --> 00:24:52,044
We have good new for you.
- Really, and what's that?

268
00:24:52,131 --> 00:24:55,210
Only for guy talk.
- I don't think so.

269
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:58,272
Why not? - Come on, man, we are going to
give you another shot.

270
00:24:58,358 --> 00:25:01,116
Don't go, Tao.
- Mind your own business girl.

271
00:25:01,202 --> 00:25:03,824
Come on, let's go
- Come.

272
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:38,157
What the hell is this?

273
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,988
Get up.
- G?t off my lawn.

274
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,172
Listen old man, you don't want to fuck with
me.

275
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:50,665
Did you hear me?
I said get off my lawn, now.

276
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,878
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in a house.

277
00:25:52,964 --> 00:25:56,676
Yeah, I'll blow the hole in your face
and then I'll go in a house.

278
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,666
And I'll sleep like a baby
You can count on that.

279
00:25:59,752 --> 00:26:03,531
We used to stack fucks like you five
feet high in Korea,

280
00:26:03,617 --> 00:26:06,561
used you for sandbags.

281
00:26:09,614 --> 00:26:11,704
Ok.

282
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:16,249
You better watch your back...

283
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,449
Thank you.

284
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:34,168
Get off my lawn.

285
00:27:07,656 --> 00:27:10,329
What the hell is this?

286
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:26,711
No, no, no, no more.

287
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,887
Stay right there.

288
00:27:31,888 --> 00:27:33,729
Why can't you people just leave me alone?

289
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,522
We brought you some shallots to plant in
the garden.

290
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:37,162
I don't want them. They?re perennials, they
come back every year.

291
00:27:37,163 --> 00:27:40,720
Look, why are bringing me all this garbage
anyway.

292
00:27:40,806 --> 00:27:42,873
Because

293
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,032
Because you saved, Tao.

294
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:49,730
I didn't save anybody. I just. I kept a
bunch of jabbering gooks off of my lawn .

295
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:52,076
You are a hero to the neighborhood.
I am not a hero.

296
00:27:52,077 --> 00:27:55,064
Too bad, they think you are and that?s why
they're keep bringing you the gifts.

297
00:27:55,065 --> 00:27:56,761
Please take them.
- All they are wrong.

298
00:27:56,817 --> 00:28:00,922
I just want to be left alone, thank you.
- Wait!

299
00:28:03,357 --> 00:28:06,737
This is my mom, Vu, I?m Sue and
that's  my brother, Tao.

300
00:28:06,822 --> 00:28:09,413
We live next door.
- So?

301
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:12,842
Tao wants to say something.

302
00:28:14,243 --> 00:28:17,999
I am sorry.
- Sorry for what?

303
00:28:18,084 --> 00:28:20,479
For trying to steal your car.

304
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,540
Let me tell you something boy.

305
00:28:24,626 --> 00:28:28,852
You step on this property again, you are
done...

306
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:53,638
Good afternoon, Walt.

307
00:28:54,005 --> 00:28:58,502
I  told you I?m not going to confession..
- Why didn't you just call the police?

308
00:28:58,588 --> 00:29:00,521
What?

309
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:02,528
I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I

310
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:04,712
heard there was some trouble
in the neighborhood.

311
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:07,633
Why didn't call the police?

312
00:29:08,144 --> 00:29:10,063
Well ...

313
00:29:11,323 --> 00:29:16,195
You know why, I've prayed that they would
show up, but..

314
00:29:16,281 --> 00:29:19,628
.. nobody answered.
- What were you thinking?

315
00:29:19,713 --> 00:29:23,418
Someone could have been killed.
We?re talking life and death here.

316
00:29:23,504 --> 00:29:26,907
When things go wrong, you gotta act quickly.

317
00:29:26,994 --> 00:29:31,419
When we were in Korea and a thousand
screaming gooks came across our land..

318
00:29:31,505 --> 00:29:36,248
... we didn't call the police. We reacted.
- We are not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski,

319
00:29:37,386 --> 00:29:40,644
I?ve been thinking about our
conversation on life and death.

320
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,549
About what you said.

321
00:29:42,634 --> 00:29:46,462
About how you carry around all the horrible
things you were forced to do

322
00:29:46,548 --> 00:29:48,988
Horrible things that won?t leave you.

323
00:29:49,223 --> 00:29:54,525
It seems that it would do you good to
unload some of that burden.

324
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,520
Things done during war are terrible.

325
00:29:57,643 --> 00:29:59,641
being ordered to kill ...

326
00:29:59,727 --> 00:30:02,666
killing to save yourself,
killing to save others.

327
00:30:02,753 --> 00:30:06,932
You?re right, those are things I
know nothing about.

328
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:09,749
But I do know about forgiveness.

329
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:13,792
And I?ve  seen a lot of men who
have confessed their sins,

330
00:30:13,793 --> 00:30:17,683
admitted their guilt and left
their burdens behind them.

331
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,104
Stronger men than you!

332
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,282
Men at war who were ordered
to do appalling things...

333
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:26,115
and are now at peace.

334
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:31,623
Well I got to hand it to you, padre, You
came here with your guns loaded this time.

335
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:35,313
Thank you!
- And you're right about one thing.

336
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:39,360
About stronger men than me,
reaching their salvation.

337
00:30:39,447 --> 00:30:42,480
Well, Hallefuckinlujah.

338
00:30:42,566 --> 00:30:47,926
- But you are wrong about something else.
- What's that, Mr. Kowalski?

339
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:53,926
The thing that haunts a man the most is what
he isn?t ordered to do.

340
00:30:58,504 --> 00:31:02,148
There, finally, you look like a human being
again. .

341
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:06,076
You shouldn?t wait so long
between haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.

342
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:08,379
Well I am surprised you are still around.

343
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,444
I was always hoping that
you die off and they get

344
00:31:10,445 --> 00:31:12,847
somebody in here they knew what
the hell they are doing.

345
00:31:12,848 --> 00:31:16,528
Instead you just keep hanging around, like
the dump wop dago you are.

346
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:20,872
- That?ll be ten dollars, Walt.
- Ten bucks, Jesus Christ, Martin.

347
00:31:20,873 --> 00:31:24,291
What are you half-Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices all the time.

348
00:31:24,292 --> 00:31:27,465
It?s been ten bucks for the last
five years and you hard-mellows,

349
00:31:27,466 --> 00:31:28,637
Pollack son of a bitch.

350
00:31:28,724 --> 00:31:33,030
Keep the change.
- See you in three weeks, prick.

351
00:31:33,205 --> 00:31:36,536
Not if I see you first, dipshit.

352
00:31:44,907 --> 00:31:46,827
That's cool, you know.

353
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:56,283
Look at this.

354
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:02,233
You tight ass over here.
Come here girl.

355
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,164
You can't say hi?
Or are you acting like stuck-up and shit.

356
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:11,983
What are you supposed to be man?
- Yo, it's cool dog.

357
00:32:12,699 --> 00:32:14,889
The fuck are you doing in my neighborhood,
boy?

358
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:20,161
None, Just going to the corner spot, you
know get some CDs, sound good, bro?

359
00:32:20,247 --> 00:32:23,829
He called, you bro!
- Come on sound good, bro?

360
00:32:23,914 --> 00:32:25,746
Sound good.
- Shut the fuck up.

361
00:32:25,832 --> 00:32:28,708
Call me bro again, and I'll bite your
motherfucking face off .

362
00:32:28,794 --> 00:32:32,723
Yeah, motherfucker.
- Now what the fuck you come down here for?

363
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:37,009
You here to bring this little present?

364
00:32:37,095 --> 00:32:41,016
Oriental yummy? Don't worry, I'll take a
real good care with her.

365
00:32:41,102 --> 00:32:44,360
Fuck out of here, .
- Fuck out of here, man!

366
00:32:46,854 --> 00:32:49,334
Oh shit, you have a bitch with you.

367
00:32:51,466 --> 00:32:53,679
Keep your ass right here.

368
00:32:53,766 --> 00:32:54,964
Oh great.

369
00:32:55,052 --> 00:32:59,488
Another asshole who has a fetish for Asian
girls. God, it gets so old.

370
00:32:59,574 --> 00:33:01,749
Oh, shit, what's your name girl?

371
00:33:01,835 --> 00:33:03,364
My name?

372
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,230
Get your ass out of here, okay.

373
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,441
It?s 'take your crude,

374
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,871
overly obvious come-on to every woman
who walks past and cram it.'

375
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:12,043
That?s my name.

376
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,480
Who do you think you are talking to?

377
00:33:15,567 --> 00:33:19,530
Who does it look like?

378
00:33:20,116 --> 00:33:22,150
Man she's tough.
- What? You gonna hit me now?

379
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:24,347
That'd pretty much complete the picture.

380
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:26,315
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.

381
00:33:26,316 --> 00:33:28,874
Put a choke chain on her and
yank that motherfucker.

382
00:33:28,961 --> 00:33:31,555
Oh, of course, right to the stereotype
thesaurus - Oh yeah

383
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:35,438
Call me a whore and a bitch in the same
sentence. -Bitch is crazy.

384
00:33:35,523 --> 00:33:38,811
I like her like that
- Now take that bitch.

385
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:47,366
You don't know when to quit do you, girl?
- Let me teach you a lesson

386
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,101
Stop! Let me go!

387
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:54,755
Take your ass over there.

388
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:01,638
What the fuck are you looking at old man?

389
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:04,413
What the hell are you spooks up to?

390
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,881
Spooks?

391
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:09,108
You'd better get your ass on honkey, while
I still let you.

392
00:34:09,194 --> 00:34:11,523
That's you'd better do.

393
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:14,257
What the fuck he thinks he is?

394
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:27,127
Have you noticed how you come across
somebody once in a while  ...

395
00:34:27,215 --> 00:34:30,600
... you shouldn't fucking with?

396
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,481
That's me.

397
00:34:36,086 --> 00:34:38,328
You are fucking crazy, get out of here, man.

398
00:34:38,413 --> 00:34:42,856
Why don't you get your ass out of here
before we kicked your wrinkly white ass.

399
00:34:44,903 --> 00:34:47,827
What's wrong with him man?

400
00:34:52,353 --> 00:34:57,441
The motherfucker's crazy!
-What is this thing? What the hell?

401
00:34:57,783 --> 00:35:00,430
Get in a truck.

402
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:07,314
Crazy motherfucker.
- What's wrong with him, man.

403
00:35:07,474 --> 00:35:12,399
Hey pops come on now.
- Shut your fucking face!

404
00:35:13,457 --> 00:35:16,101
You don't fucking listen, do you?

405
00:35:16,186 --> 00:35:19,861
Now get in a truck.
- Go get in a truck girl.

406
00:35:19,948 --> 00:35:24,092
Let her go, old man!
Shut up pussy.

407
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,525
What is this 'bro' shit anyway?

408
00:35:27,863 --> 00:35:29,808
You want to be superb page, or something

409
00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:32,292
These guy don't want to be your bro and I
don't blame them.

410
00:35:32,293 --> 00:35:35,936
Now get your old faint paddy ass on down
the road.

411
00:35:41,637 --> 00:35:44,096
Take care now.

412
00:35:46,455 --> 00:35:48,590
You too.

413
00:35:51,464 --> 00:35:54,040
Oh, yeah.

414
00:36:03,653 --> 00:36:05,977
Why didn't you do nothing?

415
00:36:06,062 --> 00:36:07,477
Man you fucking!

416
00:36:07,563 --> 00:36:11,035
Shit man.

417
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,578
If he had cannon at your fucking face, you
would do nothing.

418
00:36:14,859 --> 00:36:17,725
What's the matter with you, for Christ sake?

419
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,839
Trying to get yourself killed?

420
00:36:20,926 --> 00:36:23,694
I thought you Asian girls were supposed to
be smart.

421
00:36:23,695 --> 00:36:25,552
Hanging around in the neighborhood like that

422
00:36:25,553 --> 00:36:27,495
is the fast way to get
you in the obituaries.

423
00:36:27,496 --> 00:36:30,196
I know, I know. Take it easy.

424
00:36:30,282 --> 00:36:33,020
And what about that goofball guy you were
with.

425
00:36:33,106 --> 00:36:35,581
Is that a date or something?

426
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:41,176
Yeah, kind of. His name is Trey.
- You should be hanging out with them.

427
00:36:41,262 --> 00:36:44,575
You should be hanging out with your
own people.  The other Hummongs.

428
00:36:44,576 --> 00:36:45,501
- You mean, Hmong?

429
00:36:45,587 --> 00:36:50,470
Hmong, not Hummong
- Whatever.

430
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:55,352
What the hell is Hmong, I mean Mong anyway?

431
00:36:56,305 --> 00:36:59,351
Wow, you so enlighten you know that?

432
00:36:59,438 --> 00:37:02,207
No, Hmong is not a place,
it is a people.

433
00:37:02,294 --> 00:37:06,640
My people come from different parts
of Laos, Thailand and China.

434
00:37:06,732 --> 00:37:11,161
Well how you ended up in my neighborhood?
Why didn't you stay there?

435
00:37:11,342 --> 00:37:12,916
It's Vietnam thing.

436
00:37:13,002 --> 00:37:15,945
We thought on your side
And when American quit ...

437
00:37:16,031 --> 00:37:18,300
... the communists started killing all the
Hmong.

438
00:37:18,387 --> 00:37:20,333
So we came over here.

439
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:24,116
Yeah, well I don't know how
you ended up in Midwest.

440
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:27,174
Snow on the ground six months in the year.

441
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,582
What is it? Jungle people wanted to be
on great frozen tundra?

442
00:37:30,668 --> 00:37:36,175
Hill people. We are hill people. Not jungle
people. BOO-ga, ga-Boo, BOO-ga!

443
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,858
Yeah, whatever ...

444
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,313
Blame the Lutherans. They brought
us up here.

445
00:37:41,398 --> 00:37:45,082
Everybody blames the Lutherans.

446
00:37:45,168 --> 00:37:50,494
Well,  you'd think the cold will keep all
the idiots out.

447
00:37:51,577 --> 00:37:53,686
Thanks for the ride.

448
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:56,727
You know something kid, you are all right.

449
00:37:56,813 --> 00:38:01,225
But what about that dimwit brother of yours?
He is little slow or something?

450
00:38:01,311 --> 00:38:07,497
Tao is actually really smart. He just
doesn't know what direction to go in.

451
00:38:07,941 --> 00:38:10,905
Poor toad.
- It is really common.

452
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,938
Hmong girls over here fit in better.

453
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:16,644
The girls go to college
and the boys go to jail.

454
00:38:30,448 --> 00:38:33,911
That old hag hates my ass.

455
00:38:42,908 --> 00:38:46,319
Your birthday today, Daisy.

456
00:38:46,405 --> 00:38:50,629
This year you have to make a choice between
two life paths.

457
00:38:50,715 --> 00:38:52,801
Second chances come your way.

458
00:38:52,887 --> 00:38:57,996
Extraordinary events culminate in what
might seem to be an anticlimax.

459
00:38:58,082 --> 00:39:06,678
You lucky numbers are: 84, 23, 11, 78 and
99.

460
00:39:07,336 --> 00:39:10,247
What a load of shit.

461
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,704
Yea.

462
00:39:27,697 --> 00:39:30,959
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?

463
00:39:32,635 --> 00:39:34,511
All right.

464
00:39:34,596 --> 00:39:39,609
Let me help you with those.
- Oh, thank you.

465
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,704
How about that?

466
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,753
How about that, Daisy?

467
00:39:58,326 --> 00:40:01,771
It's too heavy for a bag.
- No problem.

468
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,023
Good, Karen, give it to him.
-Here you go.

469
00:40:16,405 --> 00:40:20,129
Well, what is it?
-It's a Gopher.

470
00:40:20,214 --> 00:40:24,013
So you can reach stuff.
It makes things a lot of easier.

471
00:40:24,693 --> 00:40:27,080
This is from me.

472
00:40:27,165 --> 00:40:30,002
It's a phone.

473
00:40:30,716 --> 00:40:32,563
Oh, I can see that.

474
00:40:32,649 --> 00:40:36,842
I just thought...well, we thought
that it would make things easier.

475
00:40:36,928 --> 00:40:38,120
Thank you, Karen.

476
00:40:38,206 --> 00:40:41,154
There?s nothing wrong with making
things less hard on yourself.

477
00:40:41,155 --> 00:40:43,830
You know Karen?s right, Dad. You?ve worked
hard your whole life.

478
00:40:43,831 --> 00:40:48,523
Maybe it's time you start thinking about
taking it a easier?

479
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:53,890
And some other thing, Dad. You really
should get rid of the coffin nails.

480
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:56,770
We were thinking about the house.

481
00:40:56,855 --> 00:41:00,492
You know, when Mom?s gone, it?s got to be a
lot to maintain around here.

482
00:41:00,578 --> 00:41:05,085
Let alone clean.
And you are here all alone ...

483
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:09,250
Yeah, you know, there?s these great places
now, you know, these communities

484
00:41:09,336 --> 00:41:12,646
Where you don?t have to worry about mowing
the lawn or shoveling snow.

485
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:17,763
You know, People who are like you, active
and alert, but are alone.

486
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:21,381
And would benefit from being around folks
their own age.

487
00:41:21,468 --> 00:41:24,865
Yeah Dad, look. You got to check it out. We
brought some brochures.

488
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:28,311
These places are nothing like that you
think they would be. They are great.

489
00:41:28,312 --> 00:41:29,477
- No, they are beautiful.

490
00:41:29,563 --> 00:41:32,564
They are really nice
They really are.

491
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:35,107
These are top-notch like resorts.

492
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:38,539
It is like staying in a hotel, practically.
- They're beautiful.

493
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:39,775
They really are.
- Yeah.

494
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:43,503
They care of everything.
They clean up. They're really nice.

495
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:46,299
Oh, there are wonderful stores, where you
can buy new shoes.

496
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,701
They are amazing, they really are.

497
00:41:47,702 --> 00:41:51,779
You have a good time, play some golf maybe.

498
00:41:51,865 --> 00:41:54,181
Meet other people.

499
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,829
Son of a bitch. Kicked us out on his
birthday. I've told you that was a bad idea.

500
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:01,553
I know, you were right
- He  won?t let anybody help him.

501
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:03,473
Well, we tried. Now can we just drop it?

502
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:05,351
No one can say we didn?t try

503
00:42:05,437 --> 00:42:07,979
What the hell with him,
we shouldn't have done it.

504
00:42:08,064 --> 00:42:10,064
We should?ve stayed home with Josh and
Ashley.

505
00:42:10,096 --> 00:42:12,895
At least they were smart
enough to not come here.

506
00:42:12,896 --> 00:42:15,466
The goddamn kids have more sense than we do.

507
00:42:16,604 --> 00:42:19,729
We miss mom, don't we Daisy?

508
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:42,701
Hey, Walt.
What are you up to?

509
00:42:44,251 --> 00:42:46,779
We?re having a barbecue. You want
to come over?

510
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:50,611
What do you think?
- There's tons of food.

511
00:42:50,696 --> 00:42:56,517
Just keep you hands off my dog.
-No worries. We only eat cats.

512
00:42:56,603 --> 00:42:59,389
Really?
- No I am kidding, you moron.

513
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:04,166
Come on you can be my special guest.
-No, I am fine right here.

514
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:06,852
Yeah ...

515
00:43:08,072 --> 00:43:13,557
Son of a bitch.
- Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?

516
00:43:13,961 --> 00:43:18,606
I had a piece of cake.
And a little beef jerky.

517
00:43:18,692 --> 00:43:23,106
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.

518
00:43:24,726 --> 00:43:26,442
Well ...

519
00:43:26,529 --> 00:43:33,486
I might as well drink with strangers better
than drinking alone. It is my birthday.

520
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:38,613
Really. Happy birthday Wally
- Don't call me Wally.

521
00:43:45,274 --> 00:43:52,071
You have no Pabts among the beer.
- As they say, "when in Hmong."

522
00:43:52,652 --> 00:43:57,024
What am I doing wrong? Every time I look at
somebody they always look at the ground.

523
00:44:03,357 --> 00:44:05,652
What is she saying?
- She said welcome to our home.

524
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:08,889
Oh no, she is not.
- Yes, she didn't.

525
00:44:09,195 --> 00:44:12,489
She hates me.
Yeah, she hates you.

526
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,566
Okay.

527
00:44:21,216 --> 00:44:25,125
What?! What are all you fish heads looking
at anyway?

528
00:44:25,212 --> 00:44:29,953
I think we should go to other room. Sorry.

529
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:36,178
All the people in this house are very
traditional.

530
00:44:36,179 --> 00:44:39,077
Number 1. Never touch a Hmong person on the
head,

531
00:44:39,163 --> 00:44:43,442
not even a child.. Hmong-people
believe that the soul resides on the head.

532
00:44:43,527 --> 00:44:47,130
So, don't do that.
- Sounds dumb, but fine.

533
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:51,995
And a lot of Hmong people consider looking
at someone eye to be very rude.

534
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:55,879
That's why they look away, when you look at
them. - Anything else?

535
00:44:55,965 --> 00:45:01,246
Yeah, some Hmong people tend to smile or
grin when they?re yelled at.

536
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:03,494
It's a cultural thing.

537
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:05,998
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity,

538
00:45:05,999 --> 00:45:08,772
it's not that they?re laughing
at you, really.

539
00:45:08,858 --> 00:45:11,420
You people are nuts

540
00:45:13,552 --> 00:45:15,570
But the food..

541
00:45:15,657 --> 00:45:20,732
It looks good, smells good too.
-Of course, its Hmong food.

542
00:45:20,919 --> 00:45:24,618
Okay, and I come back in few seconds.

543
00:45:33,613 --> 00:45:36,078
Here you go.
- Thanks. You mentioned about..

544
00:45:36,165 --> 00:45:39,634
looking at people, he's been staring at me
the whole evening.

545
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:42,565
That's  Kor Khue.
He is the Lor's family shaman.

546
00:45:42,652 --> 00:45:46,021
What's that some sort of witch doctor or
something. -  Something like that.

547
00:45:46,106 --> 00:45:50,505
Boeki Boo.
- You're funny, Wally.

548
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:08,023
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.

549
00:46:08,108 --> 00:46:09,426
He would like to read you.

550
00:46:09,512 --> 00:46:13,214
It would be rude not allow him this.
It's a great honor.

551
00:46:13,408 --> 00:46:18,059
Yeah sure. It's fine by me.
- All right, take a seat.

552
00:46:35,047 --> 00:46:39,392
He says people do not respect you. They
don't even want to look at you.

553
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:50,036
He says the way you live, your food has no
flavor. You wearied by your life.

554
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:02,228
You made a mistake. And you past life
is like a mistake what you did.

555
00:47:02,229 --> 00:47:03,697
You are not satisfied with.

556
00:47:09,677 --> 00:47:15,503
He says, you have no happiness in your life.
It's like you are not at peace.

557
00:47:40,347 --> 00:47:42,554
Are you all right?

558
00:47:43,216 --> 00:47:46,670
Yeah, I am fine.

559
00:47:46,756 --> 00:47:50,157
Fine, I am fine.

560
00:48:10,561 --> 00:48:12,963
God,  I?ve got more in common with these

561
00:48:12,964 --> 00:48:16,146
gooks than I have with my
own spoiled-rotten family.

562
00:48:16,232 --> 00:48:18,883
Jesus Christ ...

563
00:48:21,147 --> 00:48:23,765
Happy Birthday.

564
00:48:24,937 --> 00:48:29,109
Are you ok?
Yeah, I am fine.

565
00:48:29,638 --> 00:48:33,488
You were bleeding.
- No, I bit my tongue.

566
00:48:33,574 --> 00:48:34,696
It's nothing.

567
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:39,261
Why don't we get down and get some of that
good gook food. I am starving.

568
00:48:39,348 --> 00:48:41,335
Okay.

569
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:50,051
You ladies are wonderful.

570
00:48:50,137 --> 00:48:52,701
That stuff is really good.

571
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:03,219
Come on you glutton!
- What's up?

572
00:49:03,306 --> 00:49:05,807
Let's go.
- What for?

573
00:49:05,893 --> 00:49:10,041
To mingle.
- We can mingle right here.

574
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:13,598
No. You told me not to leave you alone.

575
00:49:16,671 --> 00:49:20,285
Thank you very much.
I have to go now.

576
00:49:21,698 --> 00:49:25,637
I'll be back.
Don't let me go right of it .

577
00:49:35,881 --> 00:49:40,698
Well, well, look he is over there.
- Yeah, the kid who steal my Gran Torino.

578
00:49:40,785 --> 00:49:45,849
My brother Tao.
- Tried to anyway, yeah, toad.

579
00:50:16,015 --> 00:50:20,283
It was wobby a bit.
But it should fix it.

580
00:50:49,941 --> 00:50:51,144
What's this?

581
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:54,206
Little rice liquor
Here, try it.

582
00:50:54,292 --> 00:50:56,304
All right.

583
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:22,373
My friends and I were just
wondering what you?re doing here?

584
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:26,022
That's a good question. What am I doing
here?

585
00:51:26,453 --> 00:51:29,526
My name is Walt.
- Hey, Walt. I am Wa Xam.

586
00:51:29,611 --> 00:51:33,536
Wa Yum?
- No Wa Xam.

587
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:38,743
Wa Xam, Ok.
- So what do you do?

588
00:51:38,832 --> 00:51:41,913
I fix things. Stuff like that.
- Like what?

589
00:51:41,999 --> 00:51:45,214
I've just fixed that dryer over there.

590
00:51:45,299 --> 00:51:48,420
I fixed my wife's friend sink.

591
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:53,548
I took old aunt Merry to doctor to get a
prescription. Fixed up.

592
00:51:53,635 --> 00:51:57,381
I've even the fixed the door, what had't
even broken yet.

593
00:51:57,467 --> 00:51:59,214
You're funny

594
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,583
I've been called a lot of things, but never
funny.

595
00:52:02,724 --> 00:52:08,156
Well, I have to take off. Enjoy yourself.
- Okay, Yum Yum. Later.

596
00:52:11,919 --> 00:52:14,610
Come on.

597
00:52:18,617 --> 00:52:22,926
Relax, zipper headed.
I am not gonna shoot you.

598
00:52:23,503 --> 00:52:26,664
I'd look down too if
I was you.

599
00:52:26,665 --> 00:52:29,315
You know, I knew you were a dipshit the
first time I ever saw you.

600
00:52:29,316 --> 00:52:35,564
You?re worse with women than
you are with stealing cars, Toad.

601
00:52:36,265 --> 00:52:39,223
It's  Tao.
- What?

602
00:52:39,309 --> 00:52:42,272
It's not toad, it's Tao.
My name is Tao.

603
00:52:42,358 --> 00:52:44,748
You were blowing it with that girl who was
there.

604
00:52:44,834 --> 00:52:47,991
Not that I give two shits about a Toad
like you.

605
00:52:48,078 --> 00:52:49,771
You don't what you are talking about.

606
00:52:49,857 --> 00:52:53,125
You are wrong egg roll.
I know exactly what I am talking about.

607
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,517
I may not be the most
pleasant person to be around.

608
00:52:55,603 --> 00:52:59,162
But I got the best woman who was ever
on this planet to marry me.

609
00:52:59,163 --> 00:53:02,424
I had to work at it. That was the best
thing that ever happened to me. Hangs down.

610
00:53:02,425 --> 00:53:03,717
But you ... you know

611
00:53:03,801 --> 00:53:09,106
You let Click Clack,  Ding Dong and Charlie
Chan just walk out with what?s-her-face.

612
00:53:09,192 --> 00:53:12,813
She likes you, you know. I don't know why.

613
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:15,275
Who?

614
00:53:15,805 --> 00:53:17,464
Yum yum!

615
00:53:17,551 --> 00:53:22,995
You know that girl in the purple sweater.
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.

616
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:27,949
Do you mean, Wa Xam?
- Yeah, Yum Yum.Yeah.

617
00:53:28,035 --> 00:53:31,825
Nice girl, very charming girl.
I talked with her.

618
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:35,426
But you let her just walk right out.
With the three stooges.

619
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:38,862
And you know why?
Cause you are big, fat pussy.

620
00:53:40,626 --> 00:53:42,723
Well ...

621
00:53:42,877 --> 00:53:48,055
I gotta go. Good day. Puss cake.

622
00:54:01,221 --> 00:54:03,868
No, no more.

623
00:54:06,198 --> 00:54:08,896
Okay, put them over there.

624
00:54:23,123 --> 00:54:26,953
No. No. No more
No more. No more.

625
00:54:28,923 --> 00:54:31,504
No more, please ...

626
00:54:32,292 --> 00:54:35,255
Is that chicken dumpling thing you brought
before?

627
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,351
Alright.

628
00:54:42,894 --> 00:54:46,107
Better than beef jerky all the time.

629
00:54:58,693 --> 00:55:00,850
What's going on?

630
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,452
What's going on?
-Tao is here to make amends.

631
00:55:04,538 --> 00:55:07,537
He is here to work for you.
-No, he isn't.

632
00:55:07,623 --> 00:55:10,082
He's not gonna work for me.

633
00:55:10,233 --> 00:55:14,045
My mom said dishonored the family.
And now he has to work off his dept.

634
00:55:14,129 --> 00:55:16,801
He starts tomorrow morning.
- Oh not tomorrow, not any time.

635
00:55:16,887 --> 00:55:20,964
I don't even want him on my property
I thought we went over all that.

636
00:55:21,926 --> 00:55:24,054
It is very important to my mom that you
accept.

637
00:55:24,055 --> 00:55:26,035
And that would be an insult if you refuse.

638
00:55:26,121 --> 00:55:30,138
Why is it being put back on me, all of this?
He is the one who tried to steal my car ...

639
00:55:30,224 --> 00:55:32,470
all of the sudden I am a bad guy in this
thing.

640
00:55:32,556 --> 00:55:35,015
Look my family is very traditional

641
00:55:35,102 --> 00:55:38,008
and would be very much upset if you don't
let Tao repay.

642
00:55:38,094 --> 00:55:40,787
If you doesn't want to do it, then let's
just go.

643
00:55:40,873 --> 00:55:44,219
Shut up!

644
00:55:45,265 --> 00:55:47,957
Yeah, shut up.

645
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:53,631
All right, tomorrow, tomorrow.

646
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,091
Thank you.

647
00:55:57,139 --> 00:56:02,486
Jesus, Joseph and Mary. These Hmong broads
are like badgers.

648
00:56:06,987 --> 00:56:10,444
Son of a bitch. I never thought he'd show.

649
00:56:17,098 --> 00:56:19,953
All right, what are you good at?

650
00:56:20,725 --> 00:56:24,962
Like what?
- That's what I am asking.

651
00:56:25,661 --> 00:56:28,139
You gonna work for me, I gotta know what
you are good at.

652
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:32,597
I gotta know what you can do.
- I don't know.

653
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:36,207
That's kind of half way what I expected you
to say.

654
00:56:36,971 --> 00:56:42,086
See that tree right there?
You just go over there and count the birds.

655
00:56:42,283 --> 00:56:46,048
You want me to count the birds?
- Yeah, you can count?

656
00:56:46,134 --> 00:56:49,674
All you slopes are supposed to be good at
math, right?

657
00:56:49,896 --> 00:56:52,885
Yeah, I can count.
- Good.

658
00:56:59,046 --> 00:57:02,166
One, two ...

659
00:57:05,915 --> 00:57:09,860
So, what do you have for me to do?  You
want me to watch paint dry

660
00:57:09,946 --> 00:57:12,119
or maybe count the clouds that pass by?

661
00:57:12,204 --> 00:57:14,839
Don't get flip with me, boy.

662
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:18,560
I am not the one who is trying to steal,
don't you forget that.

663
00:57:20,378 --> 00:57:21,813
Go ahead.

664
00:57:21,899 --> 00:57:24,160
I don?t care if you insult me and say
racist things.

665
00:57:24,195 --> 00:57:28,124
Cause you know what? I'll take it.
- Of cause you'll take it.

666
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:31,399
Cause you have no teeth, you have no balls,
kid.

667
00:57:33,015 --> 00:57:39,244
Look, I am stuck here. Why don't you find
something useful for me to do.

668
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:44,516
Unlike you, I am not useless. And I
maintain my own property.

669
00:57:44,835 --> 00:57:49,078
These swamp rats, on the other hand, you
just can help it.

670
00:57:50,515 --> 00:57:53,359
How long do I have you for?

671
00:57:55,655 --> 00:57:58,658
Toad, how long?

672
00:57:58,744 --> 00:58:01,142
Till next Friday.

673
00:58:04,244 --> 00:58:09,199
All right. Go get the ladder out of the
garage.

674
00:58:11,607 --> 00:58:14,083
When you got finished with that roof there.

675
00:58:14,084 --> 00:58:16,791
You can take that gutter,
and nail it back up.

676
00:58:16,877 --> 00:58:20,073
I am tired looking at it for the last three
years.

677
00:58:27,619 --> 00:58:30,182
Yeah, you said it, brother.

678
00:59:35,091 --> 00:59:36,614
Hello.

679
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,417
Grandpa says he want to know if

680
00:59:38,503 --> 00:59:45,114
you can have Tao clear out the big
wasp nest under our porch?

681
00:59:45,202 --> 00:59:49,310
Wasp nest?
That's terrible.

682
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:53,074
I think we can handle that after the lunch.

683
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:32,392
Lord All Mighty, knock it off.

684
01:00:32,478 --> 01:00:36,747
It's my last day. What else do have for me
do?

685
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:42,260
Take a day-off. You did enough.

686
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:49,228
Toad!

687
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:55,487
Nothing.
Nevermind.

688
01:01:20,573 --> 01:01:22,687
Kowski?

689
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:26,503
Kowski?

690
01:01:27,466 --> 01:01:29,542
Kowski?

691
01:01:35,865 --> 01:01:38,711
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.

692
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:41,295
I looked over your paperwork and I think we

693
01:01:41,296 --> 01:01:44,141
should immediately start
a full battery of tests

694
01:01:44,226 --> 01:01:46,793
I feel that this would be the best way to go

695
01:01:46,794 --> 01:01:49,537
about checking all the
issues that you've had.

696
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:54,292
Excuse me, what happened to Dr.Felmon, my
regular doctor?

697
01:01:54,379 --> 01:01:59,612
Dr. Felmon retired three years ago. I am
his replacement Dr. Chang.

698
01:02:07,158 --> 01:02:08,956
It's grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.

699
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:11,688
You talk to him!
Mitch.

700
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:16,644
I'm doing bills here.
- You talk to him, he is yours father.

701
01:02:21,009 --> 01:02:22,295
Hey, Dad.

702
01:02:22,381 --> 01:02:26,746
Hey, Mitch.
It's me your dad.

703
01:02:26,833 --> 01:02:29,082
Yeah, I know.
What's up?

704
01:02:29,167 --> 01:02:32,121
Oh, nothing, nothing much really.

705
01:02:32,556 --> 01:02:33,935
How is everything going?

706
01:02:34,021 --> 01:02:36,686
I am fine, fine.

707
01:02:37,374 --> 01:02:42,834
How about Karen and the kids?

708
01:02:42,964 --> 01:02:46,710
Fine, everybody is great. Doing fine.

709
01:02:46,795 --> 01:02:50,231
Good. How about work?

710
01:02:50,318 --> 01:02:53,453
Busy.

711
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,909
Yeah, I suppose...

712
01:02:55,994 --> 01:02:58,090
In fact, um, speaking of busy.

713
01:02:58,091 --> 01:03:03,054
I got a lot on my plate right now,
so if it is not something pressing.

714
01:03:03,861 --> 01:03:07,981
No, not it all.

715
01:03:08,067 --> 01:03:09,791
Why don't you call me this weekend?

716
01:03:09,877 --> 01:03:11,668
Sure.

717
01:03:11,754 --> 01:03:14,678
Ok, It was nice talking to you. Thanks for
talk.

718
01:03:14,764 --> 01:03:18,299
Thanks.

719
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:05,663
This kid doesn't have a chance.

720
01:04:19,907 --> 01:04:22,271
What do you know about faucets?

721
01:04:22,357 --> 01:04:25,048
I know a lot about them, boy.

722
01:04:25,317 --> 01:04:27,778
Tender side.

723
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:31,417
Jesus. For the love of Pete.
- What?

724
01:04:31,503 --> 01:04:36,265
It must be a hundred degrees here.
Just, turn on the fan.

725
01:04:45,032 --> 01:04:48,035
This place is wobbling apart.

726
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:54,256
Where did you get all the stuff?

727
01:04:54,342 --> 01:04:58,365
What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.

728
01:04:59,234 --> 01:05:02,636
Well, may come as surprise to a thief,

729
01:05:02,723 --> 01:05:06,109
but I bought this stuff. Everything in here
with my own money.

730
01:05:06,196 --> 01:05:10,757
Yeah, yeah. This is not what I meant.
I mean this is so much shit packed in here.

731
01:05:10,843 --> 01:05:16,859
Yeah, well. Every tool in here has a
purpose. Everything has a job to do.

732
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:21,611
They are all used when necessary.
- Okay, so, what is that?

733
01:05:21,695 --> 01:05:24,041
it is a post hole digger.
- That

734
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:26,051
Vice-grips.

735
01:05:26,137 --> 01:05:29,372
Wire cutters, you know that's a trowel.

736
01:05:29,457 --> 01:05:31,537
There is shears right there,
and that's a saw.

737
01:05:31,623 --> 01:05:34,778
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me kid.

738
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:39,998
Alright, what's on your mind.

739
01:05:40,434 --> 01:05:44,323
It's just.. I can't afford to buy all this
stuff.

740
01:05:44,409 --> 01:05:48,334
Well, I guess, even a bonehead like you,
could understand...

741
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:51,646
that a man acquires it over the period of
50 years.

742
01:05:51,732 --> 01:05:56,320
Yeah, but...
All right, look, here.

743
01:05:56,878 --> 01:06:00,109
These three items right here, you can have
this.

744
01:06:00,195 --> 01:06:05,741
WD-40, vice grips and some duck tape.

745
01:06:05,826 --> 01:06:07,650
Any man who is worth his salt,

746
01:06:07,651 --> 01:06:11,421
can do half of the house chores
with just those three things.

747
01:06:11,506 --> 01:06:13,856
Anything else you need you just borrow it,
that's all.

748
01:06:13,941 --> 01:06:17,031
Ok, cool.

749
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,413
Fuck me.
- What's with that?

750
01:06:28,499 --> 01:06:30,814
Nothing.
What?

751
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,812
Nothing, huh? I just saw
you've coughed out blood.

752
01:06:33,813 --> 01:06:36,666
That's not good. You should
really see a doctor.

753
01:06:40,372 --> 01:06:42,469
Look..

754
01:06:42,762 --> 01:06:46,141
Those guys over here, the other night ...

755
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:51,180
on my lawn, what a bout them? - Just a
gang. A bunch of Hmong gang bangers.

756
01:06:51,267 --> 01:06:53,978
I assume that.
What they were doing here?

757
01:06:54,064 --> 01:06:56,245
They were going to take me away.

758
01:06:56,246 --> 01:07:00,269
They were kind of pissed, that
I blew my first initiation.

759
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:06,494
Yeah, well you are, you are a pussy. You
wanna hang out with guys like that.

760
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:09,785
What was your initiation supposed to be?

761
01:07:18,603 --> 01:07:21,074
My Gran Torino?

762
01:07:49,074 --> 01:07:51,548
Toad, you got a minute?

763
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:56,304
Here it is.

764
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:57,848
Here is the deal.

765
01:07:57,934 --> 01:08:00,732
I take the top, cause that's the heaviest.
I'll pull on that.

766
01:08:00,818 --> 01:08:05,006
And you stand right back here, and you push.
And help me push it up each step.

767
01:08:05,093 --> 01:08:06,870
like that.
- Then, let me take the top.

768
01:08:06,955 --> 01:08:08,580
No, no, I've got a top.

769
01:08:08,666 --> 01:08:10,623
No, I'll take the top.
It looks pretty heavy.

770
01:08:10,697 --> 01:08:12,835
Look I am not crippled.
I've got the top.

771
01:08:12,919 --> 01:08:16,162
If you don't let me take the top.
I ain't helping. I will go back home.

772
01:08:16,248 --> 01:08:18,723
Listen to me, zipper head.
No, you listen, old man!

773
01:08:18,808 --> 01:08:20,940
I am here because you need help.

774
01:08:21,026 --> 01:08:23,708
So it is either top of I am
out of here.

775
01:08:26,619 --> 01:08:32,128
All right, you take the top and I'll push.

776
01:08:32,214 --> 01:08:37,433
Don't let it slip off you little girl hands
and crush me.

777
01:08:37,945 --> 01:08:40,755
Don't give me any ideas.

778
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:52,485
That thing weighs a ton.

779
01:08:52,599 --> 01:08:56,457
Runs like a clock.
They don't make them like this anymore.

780
01:08:56,543 --> 01:09:02,490
So what are you going to do with it?
- Sell it I guess.

781
01:09:03,053 --> 01:09:07,013
How much?
- 60 bucks.

782
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:11,880
I am tired of having this sit around down
in the basement there.

783
01:09:11,966 --> 01:09:15,353
Why?
You are looking for a freezer?

784
01:09:15,539 --> 01:09:20,572
Our downstairs one kind of died.
- Okay, 25 bucks and it's yours.

785
01:09:20,658 --> 01:09:22,985
25?
You've just said 60.

786
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:26,134
I know, it will save me money putting an ad
in the paper.

787
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:29,734
Come on, let haul it over your place.

788
01:09:34,694 --> 01:09:37,452
Kind of ironic, huh?
- What?

789
01:09:37,538 --> 01:09:41,414
Toad washing a car they tried to steal from
you.

790
01:09:41,501 --> 01:09:45,306
Yeah, he misses one spot.
He is doing it all over again too.

791
01:09:45,393 --> 01:09:47,654
It is nice of you to kind
look after him like this.

792
01:09:47,655 --> 01:09:49,872
He doesn't have any real
role models in his life.

793
01:09:49,958 --> 01:09:53,564
Well, I am not a role model.
But you are a good man, Wally.

794
01:09:53,651 --> 01:09:57,239
I wish our father would have been more like
you. Don't go calling me Wally.

795
01:09:57,326 --> 01:10:01,081
No, I am serious. He was really hard on us.
Really traditional...

796
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:04,560
and really old school.
Well, I am old school.

797
01:10:04,647 --> 01:10:08,390
yeah, but you an American.

798
01:10:08,603 --> 01:10:10,921
What's that supposed to me?

799
01:10:14,194 --> 01:10:16,765
You like him, don't you?
- Are you kidding?

800
01:10:16,851 --> 01:10:19,169
He tried to steal my car.

801
01:10:19,255 --> 01:10:21,864
And you spend time with him,
teaching him how to fix things.

802
01:10:21,905 --> 01:10:26,062
Saved him from a fucked cousin of ours...
- Hey, what you language lady.

803
01:10:26,146 --> 01:10:30,822
And you're a good man
- I am not a good man.

804
01:10:30,908 --> 01:10:35,024
Give me another beer, dragon lady.
This one is empty.

805
01:10:41,251 --> 01:10:45,334
You know, Hmong consider gardening to be a
woman's work.

806
01:10:45,978 --> 01:10:50,005
Yeah, that probably why I see in the garden
over there all the time.

807
01:10:50,092 --> 01:10:54,414
Besides we ain't in Hu-Mong.
- Funny.

808
01:10:56,622 --> 01:10:58,897
You know you should quit.

809
01:10:58,984 --> 01:11:04,610
That's bad for you.
Yeah? So it is being in a gang, dipshit.

810
01:11:04,809 --> 01:11:06,905
Didn't you hear what I've just said?

811
01:11:06,991 --> 01:11:11,501
I saw you coughed out blood.
You should quit.

812
01:11:13,648 --> 01:11:18,204
What's that emblem supposed to mean anyway?
Your ancient camp scout emblem?

813
01:11:18,698 --> 01:11:22,039
1'st cavalry. I've had it since 1951.

814
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:25,954
So what you wanna do with you life kid.
I was thinking maybe sales.

815
01:11:59,965 --> 01:12:05,766
So you wanna be in sales? What about going
to school, maybe.

816
01:12:05,852 --> 01:12:10,731
But school costs money.
Maybe you should get a job.

817
01:12:10,818 --> 01:12:15,762
You can't just sit there and spread mulch
in my garden for the rest of your life.

818
01:12:16,143 --> 01:12:19,835
Maybe you can just pay me.
Yeah, very funny.

819
01:12:20,783 --> 01:12:26,978
What kind of job could I ever get? - Yeah
you're right, nobody would ever hire you.

820
01:12:27,871 --> 01:12:30,839
Look I am just kidding zip... I mean.

821
01:12:30,924 --> 01:12:34,277
You can get a job. You can get a job
everywhere.

822
01:12:34,364 --> 01:12:35,718
Like what?

823
01:12:35,803 --> 01:12:38,138
How about construction?
- Me?

824
01:12:38,223 --> 01:12:39,901
Yeah.
- Construction?

825
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:41,832
Yeah.
- Do you have Alzheimer?s or something?.

826
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:46,148
No, get a job in the construction. I know
people in the trades.

827
01:12:46,233 --> 01:12:50,530
Of course I have to make a little
adjustment and man you up a little bit.

828
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,800
Man me up?
- Yeah.

829
01:12:52,886 --> 01:12:57,048
And I think you ought to date
Miss Yum Yum too.

830
01:12:57,353 --> 01:12:59,727
Do you little good.

831
01:13:01,909 --> 01:13:03,039
Get carbon off the vaults.

832
01:13:08,297 --> 01:13:11,177
Now you just gonna learn,
how guys talk.

833
01:13:11,264 --> 01:13:15,100
You just listen the way Martin and I banter
back and forth.

834
01:13:15,185 --> 01:13:17,386
You okay? You are ready?
- Sure.

835
01:13:17,473 --> 01:13:20,701
Let's go in.

836
01:13:22,042 --> 01:13:26,153
Perfect. A pollack and a chink.

837
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:29,002
How are you doing, Martin,
you crazy Italian prick.

838
01:13:29,003 --> 01:13:31,513
Walt, you cheap bastard, I should have
known you?d come in,

839
01:13:31,514 --> 01:13:33,982
I was having such a pleasant day
- What did you do?

840
01:13:34,068 --> 01:13:36,286
Jew some poor blind guy out of his money.

841
01:13:36,372 --> 01:13:38,912
Giving him a wrong change?
- Who's the nip?

842
01:13:38,999 --> 01:13:44,963
He is a pussy kid from next door.
I am just trying to man him up a little bit.

843
01:13:45,809 --> 01:13:49,432
You see kid?
That's how guys talk to one another .

844
01:13:49,564 --> 01:13:51,696
They do?
-Do you have shit in your ears?

845
01:13:51,782 --> 01:13:55,903
Now go out and come back in and talk to him
like a man.

846
01:13:55,989 --> 01:13:57,477
Like a real man.

847
01:13:57,564 --> 01:14:00,990
Come on. Get your ass out of here.

848
01:14:01,075 --> 01:14:03,847
Come on back now. Sorry about this.

849
01:14:03,933 --> 01:14:05,774
That's ok.

850
01:14:10,883 --> 01:14:13,427
What's up you old Italian prick?

851
01:14:13,514 --> 01:14:17,349
Get out of my shop before I blow your head
off you goddamn dick smoker.

852
01:14:17,435 --> 01:14:20,619
Jesus Christ.
Shit.

853
01:14:20,892 --> 01:14:25,461
Take it easy. What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

854
01:14:25,548 --> 01:14:28,195
That's what you said.
That what you said men say.

855
01:14:28,281 --> 01:14:32,549
You don't just come in and insult a man in
his own shop.

856
01:14:32,636 --> 01:14:34,465
What happens if you meet some stranger?

857
01:14:34,466 --> 01:14:37,608
If you get the wrong one he's gonna
blow you gook head right off.

858
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:42,448
What should I've said then?
- Why don't you start with Hi or Hello.

859
01:14:42,533 --> 01:14:46,210
Yeah just come in and say: 'Sir, I'd like a
haircut if you have a time'

860
01:14:46,297 --> 01:14:48,449
Yeah, be polite but don't kiss ass.

861
01:14:48,535 --> 01:14:51,448
In fact you can talk about the construction
job you just came from.

862
01:14:51,468 --> 01:14:54,425
And bitch about your girl friend in your
car.

863
01:14:54,511 --> 01:14:56,903
Son of a bitch, I've just got breaks fixed

864
01:14:56,989 --> 01:15:00,552
and those sons of the bitches really nailed
me. They screwed right in the ass.

865
01:15:00,638 --> 01:15:04,829
Yeah, don't swear at the guy. Just talk
about people who are not in the room.

866
01:15:04,915 --> 01:15:09,066
You can bitch about your boss making you
work overtime when it is bowling night.

867
01:15:09,152 --> 01:15:13,763
Right, my old lady bitches for two goddamn
hours about how..

868
01:15:13,849 --> 01:15:16,153
they don't take expired coupons at the
grocery store.

869
01:15:16,207 --> 01:15:20,775
and the minute I turn on a fucking game she
starts crying we never talk.

870
01:15:20,861 --> 01:15:23,206
See now go out, come back and talk to him.

871
01:15:23,292 --> 01:15:26,416
And it ain't a rocket science for Christ
sake.

872
01:15:26,503 --> 01:15:31,513
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car, or a
girlfriend.

873
01:15:31,599 --> 01:15:34,542
Jesus, I should have blown his head off
when I had a chance.

874
01:15:34,628 --> 01:15:39,101
Maybe so, I want you to turn around and go
outside

875
01:15:39,186 --> 01:15:42,310
and come back and don't talk about having
no job,

876
01:15:42,396 --> 01:15:50,250
no car, no girlfriend, no future, no dick.
Ok, just turn around and go.

877
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:07,499
Excuse me sir, I need a hair cut if you
ain't too busy.

878
01:16:07,584 --> 01:16:11,765
You old Italian son of a bitch prick barber.

879
01:16:12,265 --> 01:16:16,779
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys at
my construction job.

880
01:16:21,219 --> 01:16:25,370
Fuck me.

881
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:38,463
All set to go through with this, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

882
01:16:38,549 --> 01:16:43,025
Don't yeah, yeah me.
Just say: Yes sir and I'll do my best.

883
01:16:43,111 --> 01:16:46,073
Yes, I'll do my best.
- Cause when I vouch for somebody

884
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:49,785
that means I am give them my word.
I don't want you making me look bad.

885
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:52,455
No I am good. Totally into this.

886
01:16:52,539 --> 01:16:53,752
Don't lay down either.

887
01:16:53,838 --> 01:16:58,881
Just look em straight in the eye. And a man
can tell a lot by your handshake.

888
01:16:58,967 --> 01:17:02,793
Here, put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.

889
01:17:02,879 --> 01:17:05,251
Don't blow this.

890
01:17:05,947 --> 01:17:09,742
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?

891
01:17:09,828 --> 01:17:13,631
I am shitty. But who's gonna listen?
- Not me, that's for sure.

892
01:17:13,716 --> 01:17:17,838
Help yourself there, Walt.
You dumb pollack.

893
01:17:18,405 --> 01:17:20,885
Ok this is the kid, I was telling you about.

894
01:17:20,971 --> 01:17:25,217
Tao, this is Tim Kennedy,
he is super on this job.

895
01:17:25,698 --> 01:17:28,463
What we got here, Walt?

896
01:17:29,105 --> 01:17:33,210
Well he knows construction and he is a
smart kid.

897
01:17:33,296 --> 01:17:35,196
He'll do anything you need him for.

898
01:17:35,281 --> 01:17:37,511
You sure?
- Yeah.

899
01:17:37,596 --> 01:17:40,675
You speak English?
- Yes, sir.

900
01:17:40,762 --> 01:17:43,099
Were you born here?
- You bet.

901
01:17:43,185 --> 01:17:46,395
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?

902
01:17:46,482 --> 01:17:51,348
Not at the moment. Taking a bus for now.
- Bus? Jesus Christ. You don't have a car?

903
01:17:51,434 --> 01:17:53,513
My head gasket cracked and the goddamned

904
01:17:53,514 --> 01:17:56,165
pricks at the shop wants
to bend me over for $2100

905
01:17:56,249 --> 01:17:59,088
Oh please. I just replaced the tranny in my
Tahoe

906
01:17:59,173 --> 01:18:03,342
and the sons a bitches fucked me hard, just
under $3200.

907
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:07,309
Goddamned thieves. It ain?t right.
- You got that right.

908
01:18:07,395 --> 01:18:13,002
Come on in on Monday and we?ll find
something for you to do.

909
01:18:13,088 --> 01:18:14,671
Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.

910
01:18:14,757 --> 01:18:18,416
That's Tim, and what's you name again?
- Tao.

911
01:18:18,501 --> 01:18:22,094
T. .., okay.
You owe me one, Walt.

912
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:25,461
Well I'll buy a fruit cake for Christmas.

913
01:18:25,547 --> 01:18:26,781
Fuck a fruit cake.

914
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:31,023
How about you just hand over the keys to
that Gran Torino.

915
01:18:31,108 --> 01:18:35,089
What the hell does everybody want my car?
- Yeah, I am not surprised.

916
01:18:35,174 --> 01:18:39,298
Yeah, you don't know a half of it.
Alright, come on, zipper head.

917
01:18:39,623 --> 01:18:44,101
Let the Mick stay here and play with
himself.

918
01:19:04,076 --> 01:19:05,763
What are we doing?

919
01:19:05,848 --> 01:19:10,070
What do you want to do?
Carry you tools in a rice bag?

920
01:19:18,821 --> 01:19:22,021
Here.
You can use one of these ...

921
01:19:22,422 --> 01:19:25,325
and you'll need one of this here.

922
01:19:26,153 --> 01:19:27,785
I can't afford any of this.

923
01:19:27,871 --> 01:19:30,892
I'll cover it. You can pay me back with
your first pay check.

924
01:19:30,977 --> 01:19:34,604
Cool
- Here, we need something like that.

925
01:19:34,691 --> 01:19:38,421
This is what I am looking for here, tool
belt.

926
01:19:38,522 --> 01:19:39,701
There you go.

927
01:19:39,787 --> 01:19:42,216
Not to bitch. But won't I be needing some
tools.

928
01:19:42,217 --> 01:19:44,485
Tools I've got but I am not going to lend
you my tool belt.

929
01:19:44,486 --> 01:19:47,139
You can pick up tools as you go.

930
01:19:47,386 --> 01:19:49,597
I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.

931
01:19:49,682 --> 01:19:52,980
No, I really do
Thank you.

932
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:30,845
What's up homeboy, what are you doing?

933
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:33,576
What up man?
- What you got, punk?

934
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:37,716
Checking up on my little cousin.  - Yeah,
man.

935
01:20:38,169 --> 01:20:41,076
My little cousin ...
What's this?

936
01:20:41,164 --> 01:20:44,058
Where you come from man?
- I am coming

937
01:20:44,145 --> 01:20:47,046
Home from work
I know you guys don't know much about that.

938
01:20:47,132 --> 01:20:49,871
So that's true, you got a job.
- You can't just leave me alone?

939
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,055
What?

940
01:20:54,062 --> 01:20:55,233
He is scared, huh?

941
01:20:55,234 --> 01:20:57,742
Who bought this shit for you? Your dad?
- What you guys want with me?

942
01:20:57,743 --> 01:20:59,691
Your dad bought this shit for you?
- Keep your hands off my stuff.

943
01:20:59,692 --> 01:21:04,128
What's the fuck is that shit?
- What the fuck, you make me look bad?

944
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:07,705
Keep your hands off my stuff!
This massive my job man.

945
01:21:09,222 --> 01:21:11,930
Give me that, that.
- Hey come on, this is my stuff.

946
01:21:12,017 --> 01:21:14,366
You wanna smoke man? Fuck it.

947
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:17,268
Let me go.

948
01:21:17,354 --> 01:21:19,991
Give me that, man.
Give me that.

949
01:21:22,107 --> 01:21:24,815
What's the phrase I am looking for?

950
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:28,501
Oh yeah, 'saving face'

951
01:21:35,014 --> 01:21:36,826
Hey, there.

952
01:21:36,912 --> 01:21:39,715
Hey.
I gotta run.

953
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:42,749
Haven't seen you for a few days.
Where you've been?

954
01:21:42,836 --> 01:21:44,943
Been busy.

955
01:21:45,606 --> 01:21:47,583
Busy, huh?

956
01:21:50,821 --> 01:21:53,899
What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it.

957
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:56,763
What do you mean don't worry about it.
Look at your goddamn face.

958
01:21:56,764 --> 01:21:59,529
I said don't worry about it.
Okay, it's not your problem.

959
01:21:59,615 --> 01:22:01,511
When?

960
01:22:01,597 --> 01:22:05,325
Grabbed me a couple of days ago right after
I go off work.

961
01:22:05,413 --> 01:22:07,154
Cowards.

962
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,558
I did everything I can possibly do.

963
01:22:09,644 --> 01:22:12,474
But they broke some of your tools.

964
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:16,810
I will replace them.
Don't worry about the tools.

965
01:22:19,812 --> 01:22:22,193
Where is your cousin lives?

966
01:22:24,492 --> 01:22:27,883
No, Walt.
I'll be ok.

967
01:22:27,969 --> 01:22:32,094
I don't want you to do anything.
- Right,.

968
01:22:32,867 --> 01:22:37,671
You could need extra tools, you just let me
know.

969
01:22:38,189 --> 01:22:45,375
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.
-Good, go in my garage and get it.

970
01:23:19,982 --> 01:23:22,796
This should be the last stop.

971
01:23:47,879 --> 01:23:52,042
Here is the deal.
You stay away from Tao, understand?

972
01:23:52,129 --> 01:23:55,366
You tell your friends to stay away from Tao.

973
01:23:55,367 --> 01:23:58,397
You want to fight with us than I could
sound don't want to see him anymore.

974
01:23:58,398 --> 01:24:00,200
That's it, got it?

975
01:24:00,287 --> 01:24:06,148
I'll take that as yes. Cause if I have to
come back here it is gonna get fucking ugly.

976
01:24:29,997 --> 01:24:32,450
Get off of my way.

977
01:24:50,175 --> 01:24:54,330
How do you want your dog?
I mean steak?

978
01:24:54,416 --> 01:24:59,035
Funny.
I told you we only eat cats.

979
01:25:01,607 --> 01:25:03,506
I've never seen you like this before.

980
01:25:03,592 --> 01:25:06,686
Well I am feeling good.
I god beautiful women, great food.

981
01:25:06,771 --> 01:25:09,971
And Tao.
And even Tao isn't bugging me.

982
01:25:10,056 --> 01:25:12,210
You are having a good time, I see.
-Yeah.

983
01:25:12,296 --> 01:25:13,846
And it never ends.

984
01:25:13,932 --> 01:25:17,203
What happened to your knuckles anyways?

985
01:25:17,754 --> 01:25:20,393
I slipped in a shower. No big problem.

986
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:25,364
Look Yum-Yum if he doesn't ask you out I
will ask you out.

987
01:25:25,451 --> 01:25:29,513
Wa Xam, don't listen to him. He is a white
devil.

988
01:25:29,598 --> 01:25:31,464
Yeah, I am. I am a white devil.

989
01:25:31,549 --> 01:25:34,605
I've loved to Walt,
but he beat you to it.

990
01:25:34,689 --> 01:25:39,356
Really? No kidding!
Dinner and a movie, or what?

991
01:25:42,356 --> 01:25:45,728
Yeah, they are taking a bus.

992
01:25:45,821 --> 01:25:50,603
No, you can't take a bus. You gonna get you
something more stylish that that.

993
01:25:50,688 --> 01:25:53,768
Like what? Take a limo?

994
01:25:53,994 --> 01:25:56,372
How about that?

995
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:01,081
The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.

996
01:26:01,167 --> 01:26:05,987
You'd let me take the Gran Torino.
- Yeah, I let you take the Gran Torino.

997
01:26:06,072 --> 01:26:08,187
Really?

998
01:26:08,651 --> 01:26:10,948
Yeah, really.

999
01:26:57,650 --> 01:26:59,976
Is everybody all right?

1000
01:27:03,742 --> 01:27:06,185
Tao!

1001
01:27:07,293 --> 01:27:10,855
It's all right.
Where's grandma?

1002
01:27:12,405 --> 01:27:14,547
Where is Sue?

1003
01:27:14,633 --> 01:27:16,654
Where is Sue?
- She went to our aunts.

1004
01:27:16,741 --> 01:27:18,955
To her aunts? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1005
01:27:19,042 --> 01:27:21,916
Get on the phone and call her right now.

1006
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:53,296
Sue ...

1007
01:27:53,382 --> 01:27:56,729
I knew, this was gonna happen.

1008
01:27:57,182 --> 01:28:00,438
What the hell am I doing here?

1009
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:04,634
Maybe some of her friends called her and
she changed her plans.

1010
01:28:04,718 --> 01:28:06,717
Yeah.

1011
01:28:08,668 --> 01:28:15,121
At the war we just  all of us lost a lot of
friends but you gotta stand for it.

1012
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:17,090
You can care to it.

1013
01:30:20,636 --> 01:30:23,010
Mr. Kowalski?

1014
01:30:32,601 --> 01:30:34,211
Are you Ok?

1015
01:30:34,295 --> 01:30:38,211
Yeah, I am Ok.

1016
01:30:38,325 --> 01:30:42,391
Police finally left, no one is talking.

1017
01:30:42,608 --> 01:30:45,577
One thing about Hmong, they keep their
mouths shut.

1018
01:30:45,663 --> 01:30:48,353
Yeah, I've noticed that.

1019
01:30:54,940 --> 01:31:00,362
You know, Tao and Sue will never gonna find
peace in this world

1020
01:31:00,448 --> 01:31:03,265
as long as those gangs around.

1021
01:31:03,593 --> 01:31:07,843
Until they go away. You know forever.

1022
01:31:09,836 --> 01:31:12,269
What are you saying?

1023
01:31:12,626 --> 01:31:15,229
You know what I am saying.

1024
01:31:16,176 --> 01:31:18,540
I took Sue to the hospital.

1025
01:31:18,843 --> 01:31:20,862
She is scared.

1026
01:31:20,948 --> 01:31:25,213
They are all scared..
Yeah

1027
01:31:26,290 --> 01:31:31,259
Tao especially. He?s sitting out there
right now staring at your front door.

1028
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:35,836
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.

1029
01:31:36,367 --> 01:31:38,438
What would you do?

1030
01:31:39,053 --> 01:31:44,172
What should Tao do?
I know what I would do if I was you.

1031
01:31:44,436 --> 01:31:48,882
Or at least what you think you should do.
- Really

1032
01:31:49,027 --> 01:31:52,305
If I was Tao I guess I'd wanted vengeance.

1033
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:56,431
I'd wanted to stand shoulder to shoulder
with you and kill those guys.

1034
01:31:57,126 --> 01:32:01,274
And you?
- What would I do?

1035
01:32:03,901 --> 01:32:07,048
I'd come over here and talk to you I guess.

1036
01:32:07,958 --> 01:32:12,462
I know you are close with these people, but
this pisses me off too. Mr.Kowalski.

1037
01:32:14,686 --> 01:32:18,305
Wanna beer?
- I'd love one.

1038
01:32:18,391 --> 01:32:22,195
There some in the chest, right over there
behind you.

1039
01:32:46,963 --> 01:32:49,088
Damn all this.

1040
01:32:50,081 --> 01:32:54,761
It just isn't fair.
- Nothing is fair, father.

1041
01:32:57,561 --> 01:33:00,212
So what you gonna do, Mr. Kowalski?

1042
01:33:01,681 --> 01:33:04,087
Call me Walt.

1043
01:33:04,783 --> 01:33:06,829
All right.

1044
01:33:07,604 --> 01:33:09,895
What you gonna do,  Walt?

1045
01:33:10,229 --> 01:33:12,561
I don't know.

1046
01:33:12,778 --> 01:33:15,227
But I'll think of something.

1047
01:33:15,945 --> 01:33:20,035
Whatever it is, they won't have a chance.

1048
01:33:31,295 --> 01:33:33,217
What are you doing?

1049
01:33:33,747 --> 01:33:35,176
Thinking.

1050
01:33:35,261 --> 01:33:38,175
Thinking.
Thinking time is over.

1051
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:41,240
Now it's time to knock shit out of these
pricks.

1052
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:45,400
I know you don't want to hear this, but now
it's the time to stay calm.

1053
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:47,901
Calm? You want me to be calm?

1054
01:33:47,986 --> 01:33:50,785
We stay calm or else mistakes will get made.

1055
01:33:50,871 --> 01:33:53,832
We have to step back from this thing.

1056
01:33:53,918 --> 01:33:57,329
No, don't let me down Walt. Not you.

1057
01:33:57,415 --> 01:33:59,695
This is gonna end today.

1058
01:34:00,014 --> 01:34:01,229
Sit down.

1059
01:34:01,314 --> 01:34:04,904
I don't want to sit. I said sit down.

1060
01:34:08,281 --> 01:34:10,051
Now, listen to me.

1061
01:34:10,136 --> 01:34:13,147
We gotta plan this and plan it very
carefully.

1062
01:34:13,233 --> 01:34:15,062
Can't make any mistakes.

1063
01:34:15,148 --> 01:34:18,549
You know I am the right man for this job.

1064
01:34:18,635 --> 01:34:23,870
I want to go home and stay calm, and come
back here at 4 this afternoon.

1065
01:34:24,102 --> 01:34:28,762
And this to be done will be done.
I say we go now, Right now.

1066
01:34:28,848 --> 01:34:31,925
And what? Kill that cousin of yours and the
rest of those zips.

1067
01:34:32,010 --> 01:34:37,905
Mr. Tough Guy is out for blood all of the
sudden. I know nothing about it.

1068
01:34:40,643 --> 01:34:43,172
Now go home.

1069
01:34:43,704 --> 01:34:49,381
You stay calm come back here at 4.

1070
01:34:49,522 --> 01:34:52,036
Ok?

1071
01:34:53,865 --> 01:34:56,116
Okay.

1072
01:35:26,039 --> 01:35:28,025
I know, I know. Give me a break,

1073
01:35:28,026 --> 01:35:31,750
please,  it?s the first time
I?ve ever smoked in the house.

1074
01:35:33,621 --> 01:35:38,207
Let a man enjoy himself,would you girl.

1075
01:35:40,868 --> 01:35:43,363
All finished. 10 dollars American.

1076
01:35:43,364 --> 01:35:45,588
I don?t suppose your guinea  hands are
steady enough

1077
01:35:45,589 --> 01:35:47,955
to do a straight shave?
- Straight shave?

1078
01:35:47,956 --> 01:35:49,685
You've never asked about straight shave
ever.

1079
01:35:49,686 --> 01:35:51,565
I know but I always wondered about it.

1080
01:35:51,652 --> 01:35:56,430
That's unless you are too busy.
No, just let me heat up a towel.

1081
01:35:56,517 --> 01:35:58,458
Here is 20.

1082
01:35:58,543 --> 01:36:03,311
Keep the change. It is just in case you hit
my jugular.

1083
01:36:11,279 --> 01:36:16,913
Yes sir, It gonna take about one hour. We
gonna shorten these sleeves little bit.

1084
01:36:17,319 --> 01:36:19,883
Gonna fix at the shoulder.

1085
01:36:19,970 --> 01:36:22,862
I never had a suited suit before.
Yes sir, look very good.

1086
01:36:22,949 --> 01:36:25,162
Yes, sir.

1087
01:36:25,747 --> 01:36:28,016
Look very good.

1088
01:36:35,221 --> 01:36:39,894
What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?
- I am here for a confession.

1089
01:36:39,979 --> 01:36:43,551
Lord Jesus, what have you done?
- Nothing you just take it easy now.

1090
01:36:43,636 --> 01:36:48,046
What are you up to?
Are you gonna give a confession or not?

1091
01:36:50,978 --> 01:36:53,587
How long has it been since your last
confession?

1092
01:36:53,674 --> 01:36:55,844
Forever.

1093
01:36:57,398 --> 01:37:02,937
Bless me father, for I have sinned.
What are your sins, my son?

1094
01:37:05,852 --> 01:37:11,701
In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski
at the factory Christmas party.

1095
01:37:11,786 --> 01:37:15,110
Dorothy was in the other room with the
other wives.

1096
01:37:15,472 --> 01:37:17,507
it just happened.

1097
01:37:17,939 --> 01:37:19,701
Yes, go on.

1098
01:37:19,787 --> 01:37:24,261
Well, I made 900 dollars profit selling a
boat and motor.

1099
01:37:24,594 --> 01:37:28,514
I didn't pay the taxes it is the same as
stealing.

1100
01:37:28,881 --> 01:37:31,189
Yes, fine.

1101
01:37:31,712 --> 01:37:34,064
Lastly...

1102
01:37:34,901 --> 01:37:38,755
I was never very close with my two sons.

1103
01:37:39,003 --> 01:37:43,310
I don't know them. I didn't know how.

1104
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:48,347
That's it?
- That's it.

1105
01:37:48,522 --> 01:37:52,071
It's bothered me most of my life.

1106
01:37:52,973 --> 01:37:56,253
Say 10 "Hail Maries"
and 5 "Our fathers".

1107
01:37:56,352 --> 01:38:00,596
God loves and forgives you and absolves you
of all your sins.

1108
01:38:00,681 --> 01:38:05,516
In the name of the Father, Son and the Holy
Spirit.

1109
01:38:06,332 --> 01:38:09,120
Thank you padre.

1110
01:38:12,171 --> 01:38:14,923
Are you going to retaliate for what
happened to Sue.

1111
01:38:15,908 --> 01:38:18,179
I?m going over to that house today, Mr.
Kowalski.

1112
01:38:18,266 --> 01:38:20,913
Is that so?
- It is.

1113
01:38:20,914 --> 01:38:23,934
And every other day until you see the folly
of what you are planning.

1114
01:38:23,935 --> 01:38:28,340
Busy day, gotta go.
- Go in peace.

1115
01:38:29,721 --> 01:38:32,557
Oh I am at peace.

1116
01:38:34,602 --> 01:38:37,184
Jesus Christ.

1117
01:38:50,596 --> 01:38:53,089
So which one is mine?

1118
01:38:54,015 --> 01:38:59,407
You ever fired a weapon before?
- No

1119
01:39:01,189 --> 01:39:03,839
Why don't you put that one down.

1120
01:39:03,924 --> 01:39:06,398
I got something more to show you.

1121
01:39:06,483 --> 01:39:08,511
What?

1122
01:39:11,829 --> 01:39:16,968
In 1952 we were sent to take out a chink
machine gun nest.

1123
01:39:17,055 --> 01:39:21,346
They trod us up pretty good. I was the only
one who came back out there.

1124
01:39:21,430 --> 01:39:25,776
For that they gave me a silver star.
Here it is.

1125
01:39:27,533 --> 01:39:30,501
Here I want you to have it.

1126
01:39:30,993 --> 01:39:33,060
Why?

1127
01:39:33,566 --> 01:39:37,119
Because we all knew the danger that night.
But we went anyway.

1128
01:39:37,205 --> 01:39:39,563
That's the way it might be tonight.

1129
01:39:39,650 --> 01:39:43,204
There is always a chance you don't come
back. The hell we won?t.

1130
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:44,986
We?re will  roll in there and tear ass.

1131
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:49,513
Yeah, that's foolish. That's the exact
reaction they are waiting for.

1132
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,407
Come on and close this up.

1133
01:39:51,493 --> 01:39:54,938
How many?
- How many what?

1134
01:39:55,311 --> 01:39:58,240
How many men did you kill in Korea?

1135
01:39:58,353 --> 01:40:03,348
13, maybe more.
-What was it like to kill a man.

1136
01:40:04,059 --> 01:40:07,070
You don't want to know.

1137
01:40:07,235 --> 01:40:09,887
Now close it up.

1138
01:40:24,601 --> 01:40:28,502
Walt! Walt!
What are you doing?

1139
01:40:28,685 --> 01:40:30,807
What are you doing?

1140
01:40:30,893 --> 01:40:34,200
Relax, you can't get out of there.
You let me out right now !

1141
01:40:34,286 --> 01:40:37,725
Let me out. You fuck let me out, I'll
fucking kill you.

1142
01:40:37,811 --> 01:40:39,086
Shut the fuck up!

1143
01:40:39,171 --> 01:40:41,508
You want to know what is like to kill a man?

1144
01:40:41,593 --> 01:40:44,038
Well, that's goddamn awful.

1145
01:40:44,039 --> 01:40:47,142
The only thing worse is get a medal of
valor for killing some poor kids..

1146
01:40:47,143 --> 01:40:50,115
that wanted just to give up that's all

1147
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:52,883
Yeah, some scared little gook just like you.

1148
01:40:52,968 --> 01:40:56,954
I shot them right in a face with that rifle
you were holding in there a while ago.

1149
01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:01,626
So if the day goes by that I don't think
about it. You don't that on your soul.

1150
01:41:02,117 --> 01:41:04,877
I got blood on my hands. I am soiled.

1151
01:41:04,963 --> 01:41:08,233
That's why I am going alone tonight.

1152
01:41:08,319 --> 01:41:12,257
Walt you take me with you right now,
let me out.

1153
01:41:12,366 --> 01:41:15,184
Look, you've come a long way.

1154
01:41:15,270 --> 01:41:18,994
I am proud to say that you are my friend.
But you got your whole life ahead of you.

1155
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:25,132
But me, I finished things.  That's what I
do and I am going alone.

1156
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:28,371
No, wait. Walt! Walt!

1157
01:41:47,592 --> 01:41:50,432
I need you to watch my dog.

1158
01:41:52,498 --> 01:41:54,946
Yeah I love you too.

1159
01:41:59,986 --> 01:42:03,005
Yeah, she is old too.

1160
01:42:05,964 --> 01:42:08,822
Her name is Daisy.

1161
01:42:25,091 --> 01:42:26,761
Hello.
- It is Walt.

1162
01:42:26,847 --> 01:42:30,297
The keys to my house are under the ceramic
turtle on the from porch.

1163
01:42:30,382 --> 01:42:35,262
Let yourself in. Your brother is in the
basement. I gotta go.

1164
01:42:50,889 --> 01:42:53,375
Sorry father, we have to go.

1165
01:42:53,830 --> 01:42:57,275
I am telling if we are not here there will
be a bloodshed.

1166
01:42:57,362 --> 01:42:58,875
We've been here for hours.

1167
01:42:58,961 --> 01:43:01,600
We can't afford to anchor a unit down to
one location.

1168
01:43:01,685 --> 01:43:03,798
I am bagging you to stay.

1169
01:43:03,883 --> 01:43:07,334
Just got a word from my sergeant, we're
pulling the plug.

1170
01:43:07,467 --> 01:43:10,611
I am staying. No you aren't.

1171
01:43:11,751 --> 01:43:15,804
We have specific orders you came with us,
you are leaving with us.

1172
01:43:15,891 --> 01:43:17,950
Watch your head.

1173
01:43:27,104 --> 01:43:30,057
Sue, over here, over here.

1174
01:43:30,143 --> 01:43:31,573
Unlock this right now.

1175
01:43:31,659 --> 01:43:33,237
He left without me.

1176
01:43:33,323 --> 01:43:35,752
He went to Smokie without me.

1177
01:43:36,865 --> 01:43:39,020
Tao!

1178
01:44:08,598 --> 01:44:11,578
Any swamp rats in there.

1179
01:44:12,083 --> 01:44:15,574
I didn't know your ass would came.
-Shut up, gook.

1180
01:44:16,207 --> 01:44:20,726
I have nothing to say to you, shrimp dick,
lizard like you.

1181
01:44:23,362 --> 01:44:27,560
Yeah, yeah. You go ahead watch out for your
boyfriend.

1182
01:44:27,645 --> 01:44:32,567
Cause it was either he or you or something
who raped one of their own family.

1183
01:44:32,653 --> 01:44:35,453
You own blood, for Christ sake.

1184
01:44:35,539 --> 01:44:39,351
Now go ahead and pull those pistols, like
miniature cowboys.

1185
01:44:39,437 --> 01:44:41,052
Go ahead.

1186
01:44:41,138 --> 01:44:43,951
So where's Tao at? That pussy motherfucker
not gonna come.

1187
01:44:44,037 --> 01:44:46,093
Don't worry about Tao.

1188
01:44:46,178 --> 01:44:49,492
Tao's got not one second for you.

1189
01:44:49,743 --> 01:44:53,389
Says who?
You?

1190
01:44:54,063 --> 01:44:57,127
What the fuck you gonna do, old man?

1191
01:44:59,189 --> 01:45:01,776
What are you gonna do? You bitch.
-

1192
01:45:02,894 --> 01:45:05,790
Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
- Shut the fuck up.

1193
01:45:05,876 --> 01:45:08,974
You should the fuck up!

1194
01:45:19,429 --> 01:45:21,956
Got a light?
- What the fuck?

1195
01:45:26,314 --> 01:45:28,605
No

1196
01:45:28,691 --> 01:45:33,574
Me.. I've got a light...

1197
01:45:36,112 --> 01:45:39,813
'Hail Mary, full of grace..'

1198
01:46:44,665 --> 01:46:46,133
Yes, sergeant.

1199
01:46:46,219 --> 01:46:48,094
What happened?
- You need to step back.

1200
01:46:48,179 --> 01:46:51,522
He is a friend of mine.
- He said step back.

1201
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:54,844
Hey, did you hear him.
Step back.

1202
01:46:54,930 --> 01:46:57,492
What happened?
- Hey, step back.

1203
01:46:57,578 --> 01:46:59,719
He is my friend.

1204
01:47:15,067 --> 01:47:19,365
Officer Chang! get those people back.
- Hey, step back now, Ok.

1205
01:47:38,834 --> 01:47:42,016
Get the fuck out of here!

1206
01:49:19,591 --> 01:49:23,999
Walt Kowalski once said to me that I didn't
know anything about life or death.

1207
01:49:24,085 --> 01:49:26,276
Because I was an overeducated,

1208
01:49:26,277 --> 01:49:31,318
27-year-old virgin who held the hands
of superstitious old women and

1209
01:49:31,402 --> 01:49:34,273
promised they eternity.

1210
01:49:34,621 --> 01:49:38,194
Walt definitely had no problem calling
it like he saw it.

1211
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:40,552
But he was right.

1212
01:49:40,639 --> 01:49:46,432
I knew really nothing about life or death,
until I got to know Walt.

1213
01:49:46,878 --> 01:49:49,584
And boy did I learn.

1214
01:49:55,549 --> 01:50:00,578
And I want to leave my house  to the church
becouse Dorothy would've liked it...

1215
01:50:02,812 --> 01:50:07,514
... now which brings to out last item . And
again please excuse the language.
