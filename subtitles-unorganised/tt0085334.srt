{1268}{1325}Ah, there it is. My house.
{1346}{1428}And good old Cleveland Street.|How could I ever forget it?
{1444}{1514}And there I am,|with that dumb round face and...
{1515}{1559}that stupid stocking cap.
{1579}{1650}But no matter. Christmas was on its way.
{1658}{1725}Lovely, glorious, beautiful Christmas...
{1733}{1795}around which the entire kid year revolved.
{2366}{2457}Downtown Hohman was prepared|for its yearly bacchanalia of...
{2461}{2523}peace on earth and good will to men.
{3721}{3809}Higbees' corner window|was traditionally a high-water mark...
{3811}{3859}of the pre-Christmas season.
{3890}{3993}First nighters, packed earmuff to earmuff,|jostled in wonderment...
{4006}{4086}before a golden tinkling display...
{4094}{4169}of mechanized, electronic joy.
{5238}{5281}Wow, there it is.
{5307}{5366}The holy grail of Christmas gifts.
{5367}{5437}The Red Ryder 200-shot range model...
{5438}{5466}air rifle.
{5488}{5535}And there he is.
{5547}{5583}Red Ryder himself.
{5594}{5697}In his hand was the knurled stock|of as coolly deadly-looking...
{5698}{5794}a piece of weaponry|as ever I had laid eyes on.
{5907}{6003}For weeks, I had been scheming|to get my mitts on one of these...
{6006}{6070}fearsome blue-steel beauties.
{6075}{6177}My fevered brain seethed|with the effort of trying to come up with...
{6178}{6271}the infinitely subtle devices|necessary to implant...
{6273}{6349}the Red Ryder range model|air rifle indelibly...
{6357}{6414}into my parents' subconscious.
{6420}{6443}Ralphie!
{6456}{6479}Randy!
{6483}{6527}Down here in two minutes!
{6537}{6584}And I mean two minutes!
{6586}{6645}Come on, Ralphie. I got here first!
{6795}{6828}Cut it out.
{7446}{7523}My mother, grabbing for her copy|of Look magazine...
{7533}{7636}would find herself cleverly trapped|into reading a Red Ryder sales pitch.
{7704}{7762}They traded Bullfrog. I don't believe it.
{7777}{7805}What's that?
{7817}{7884}Well, for Christ's sake,|the Sox traded Bullfrog...
{7886}{7937}the only player they've got,|for Shottenhoffer.
{7940}{8001}"Four Eyes" Shottenhoffer,|a utility infielder.
{8007}{8079}Got a whole goddamned team|of utility infielders.
{8081}{8114}That's nice.
{8118}{8164}Ralphie, on the double!
{8203}{8257}Did you hear about this guy|who swallowed a yo-yo?
{8259}{8323}- Swallowed a yo-yo?|- On a bet.
{8325}{8385}Some clodhopper down in Griffith, Indiana.
{8418}{8483}They write the silliest things|in the newspapers.
{8493}{8556}What do you mean, silly?|I mean that's real news.
{8558}{8609}That's not like that politics slop.
{8635}{8747}What is the name|of the Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?
{8764}{8807}Victor. His name is Victor.
{8817}{8889}- How the hell did you know that?|- Everybody knows that.
{8929}{8992}That's another one of your silly puzzles?
{8997}{9053}Yeah, it's another one of our silly puzzles.
{9054}{9135}Could be worth $50,000.
{9162}{9205}What kind is it this time?
{9215}{9290}Name the great characters|in American literature.
{9309}{9392}Victor?|The Lone Ranger's nephew's horse?
{9398}{9476}Meanwhile, I struggled|for exactly the right BB gun hint.
{9478}{9512}It had to be firm, but subtle.
{9518}{9590}Flick says he saw some grizzly bears|near Pulaski's candy store.
{9732}{9824}They looked at me as if|I had lobsters crawling out of my ears.
{9850}{9940}I could tell that I was in imminent danger|of over-playing my hand.
{9960}{10006}Casually, I switched tactics.
{10022}{10048}Hey, Dad!
{10079}{10157}I'll bet you'll never guess|what I got you for Christmas.
{10194}{10226}A new furnace.
{10270}{10308}That's a good one, Dad.
{10342}{10419}My old man was one|of the most feared furnace-fighters...
{10421}{10463}in northern Indiana.
{10472}{10537}Hurry up,|you're going to be late for school.
{10545}{10602}Yeah. I'm running late already.
{10608}{10645}Round one was over.
{10666}{10693}Parents, one.
{10696}{10721}Kids, zip.
{10758}{10827}I could feel the Christmas noose|beginning to tighten.
{10835}{10906}Maybe what happened next|was inevitable.
{10908}{10970}Ralphie, what would you like|for Christmas?
{10974}{11026}Horrified, I heard myself blurt it out.
{11029}{11125}I want an official Red Ryder carbine action|200-shot range model air rifle.
{11155}{11202}No. Shoot your eye out.
{11203}{11293}Oh, no! It was|the classic mother-BB gun block.
{11304}{11341}"You'll shoot your eye out."
{11346}{11433}That deadly phrase uttered|many times before by hundreds...
{11436}{11483}of mothers was not surmountable...
{11485}{11533}by any means known to kid-dom.
{11538}{11629}But such was my mania,|my desire for a Red Ryder carbine...
{11631}{11709}that I immediately began|to rebuild the dike.
{11736}{11810}I was just kidding.|Even though Flick is getting one.
{11826}{11861}I'd just like some Tinkertoys.
{11862}{11924}I couldn't believe my own ears.|Tinkertoys?
{11927}{11961}She'd never buy it.
{11971}{12015}BB guns are dangerous.
{12017}{12055}I don't want anyone shooting his eye out.
{12196}{12288}Randy, will you eat?|There are starving people in China.
{12514}{12578}Mothers know nothing|about creeping marauders...
{12582}{12630}burrowing through the snow|toward the kitchen...
{12632}{12717}where only you, and you alone,|stand between your tiny...
{12721}{12786}huddled family and insensate evil.
{12975}{13053}Save us, Ralphie!|I just knew those bad guys...
{13054}{13113}would be coming for us in the end!
{13134}{13212}Don't worry, Dad.|As long as I got OI' Blue...
{13324}{13358}What've we got here, folks?
{13360}{13430}Well, we figure it's Black Bart, Ralph.
{13439}{13493}Well, just me and my trusty old...
{13496}{13585}Red Ryder carbine-action|200-shot range model air rifle.
{13597}{13658}Lucky I've got a compass in the stock.
{13664}{13717}Well, I think I better have a look here.
{14052}{14080}Oh, no!
{14091}{14146}It's OI' Blue!
{14154}{14187}Oh, no!
{14206}{14245}Cheese it, boys!
{14534}{14623}There's another one!|He's a dead-eye, ain't he?
{14796}{14833}Okay, Ralphie!
{14835}{14909}You win this time, but we'll be back!
{15030}{15063}Adios, Bart.
{15080}{15168}But if you do come back,|you'll be pushing up daisies!
{15286}{15322}And don't you forget it!
{15323}{15361}Well, son, you saved us!
{15362}{15435}We were goners for sure!|And you saved us!
{15638}{15671}Oldsmobile!
{15681}{15717}A pile of junk!
{15747}{15800}That goddamned Olds is froze up again!
{15802}{15917}Some men are Baptists, others Catholics.|My father was an Oldsmobile man.
{15924}{16021}That son of a bitch would freeze up|in the middle of summer on the Equator!
{16030}{16094}- Little pitchers...|- Hold it!
{16415}{16452}It's a clinker!
{16495}{16546}That blasted, stupid furnace.
{16548}{16580}Dadgummit!
{16706}{16741}Damn skates!
{16811}{16864}For Christ's sake,|open up the damper, will you?
{16866}{16930}Who the hell turned it|all the way down again?
{16954}{16978}Blasted!
{17210}{17323}In the heat of battle,|my father wove a tapestry of obscenity...
{17329}{17434}that as far as we know is still hanging|in space over Lake Michigan.
{17707}{17765}Preparing to go to school|was like getting ready...
{17766}{17826}for extended deep-sea diving.
{18293}{18386}- Come on, Mom, we're going to be late!|- Just wait, Ralph!
{18416}{18477}My kid brother looked like|a tick about to pop.
{18479}{18498}What?
{18527}{18547}What is it?
{18570}{18610}What is it?
{18706}{18785}- What is it?|- I can't put my arms down!
{19062}{19124}Well, put your arms down|when you get to school.
{19842}{19878}Hey, Flick! Wait up.
{19882}{19911}Wait up!
{19928}{19953}So what are you doing?
{19959}{20018}What does it look like I'm doing?|Picking goobers?
{20023}{20105}Hey, listen, smart ass.|I asked my old man about sticking...
{20106}{20164}your tongue to metal light poles|in winter...
{20166}{20247}and he says it will freeze right to the pole|just like I told you.
{20253}{20277}Baloney.
{20279}{20326}What would your old man know|about anything?
{20328}{20383}He knows because he once saw a guy|stick his tongue...
{20385}{20471}to a railroad track on a bet|and the fire department had to come...
{20473}{20566}to get the guy's tongue off the track|because he couldn't get it off.
{20567}{20609}Come on, guys, wait up!
{20611}{20647}Come on, guys!
{20658}{20712}Come on, guys, wait up!
{20838}{20871}I can't get up!
{20902}{20945}I can't get up!
{20946}{20969}Help!
{21003}{21057}I can't get out! Help me!
{21091}{21131}Come on, Flick, wait up for me.
{21134}{21177}I can't get up!
{21260}{21279}Come on.
{21281}{21337}Get up. Sit up. Come on.
{21381}{21415}You're okay. Come on, let's go.
{21417}{21449}Come on, you're all right!
{21670}{21694}Miss Shields!
{21718}{21743}All right, everyone...
{21745}{21785}take your seats, please.
{21978}{22021}Good morning, class.
{22022}{22102}Good morning, Miss Shields.
{22938}{22995}Open your books to Page 32.
{22997}{23066}And as you'll remember, Silas Marner...
{23317}{23380}You're full of beans and so's your old man.
{23408}{23461}- Says who?|- Says me.
{23463}{23509}Well, I double-dare you.
{23510}{23573}The exact exchange and nuance...
{23576}{23659}of phrase in this ritual is very important.
{23665}{23726}Are you kidding?|Stick my tongue to that stupid pole?
{23729}{23752}That's dumb.
{23754}{23801}That's 'cause you know it will stick!
{23803}{23841}You're full of it.
{23854}{23905}Well, I double dog-dare you!
{23918}{23996}Now it was serious. A double dog-dare.
{24008}{24060}What else was left but a "triple-dare you"?
{24062}{24123}And finally,|the coup de grace of all dares...
{24125}{24182}the sinister triple dog-dare!
{24197}{24258}I triple dog-dare you!
{24282}{24342}Schwartz created|a slight breach of etiquette...
{24344}{24431}by skipping the triple-dare|and going right for the throat.
{24433}{24465}All right, all right.
{24698}{24777}- Go on, smart ass, and do it!|- I'm going!
{24794}{24891}Flick's spine stiffened,|his lips curled in a defiant sneer.
{24904}{24951}There was no going back now.
{25024}{25062}This is nothing.
{25167}{25206}Stuck? Stuck!
{25208}{25258}Stuck! Stuck!
{25400}{25426}Jeez!
{25430}{25464}It really works!
{25466}{25500}Look at him!
{25748}{25782}Ralphie, come back!
{25783}{25865}- Come back! Don't leave me! Come back!|- But the bell rang!
{25868}{25952}- What are we going to do?|- I don't know! The bell rang!
{26196}{26226}Where's Flick?
{26268}{26300}Has anyone seen Flick?
{26304}{26345}Flick? Flick who?
{26347}{26398}He was at recess, wasn't he?
{26438}{26497}Ralphie, do you know where Flick is?
{26633}{26714}I said has anyone seen Flick?
{26771}{26810}Yes, Esther Jane?
{26956}{26994}Oh, my God!
{27494}{27554}Holy cow, it's the fire department!
{27725}{27766}Wow, it's the cops!
{29025}{29121}Now, I know that some of you|put Flick up to this.
{29186}{29248}But, he has refused to say who.
{29310}{29373}But those who did it know their blame.
{29425}{29498}And I'm sure the guilt you feel...
{29504}{29599}is far worse than any punishment|you might receive.
{29702}{29753}Now, don't you feel terrible?
{29780}{29848}Don't you feel remorse|for what you have done?
{29906}{29972}That's all I'm going to say|about poor Flick.
{30045}{30128}Adults love to say things like that.|But kids know better.
{30130}{30221}We knew darn well|it was always better not to get caught.
{30224}{30302}Now, boys and girls,|I'm going to give you an assignment.
{30331}{30372}I want you to write...
{30398}{30426}a theme.
{30513}{30568}"What I want for Christmas."
{30601}{30636}The clouds lifted.
{30650}{30707}And I want it handed in|tomorrow morning...
{30709}{30783}I saw a faint gleam of light|at the other end of...
{30785}{30829}the black cave of doom.
{30831}{30928}I knew that when Miss Shields|read my magnificent, eloquent theme...
{30930}{30997}that she would sympathize|with my plight...
{30998}{31075}and everything would work out, somehow.
{31443}{31502}Boy, did you see how it stuck?
{31516}{31593}- Did it hurt, Flick?|- No. I never felt a thing.
{31595}{31634}It just caught me off-guard.
{31636}{31699}- You sure were bawling.|- I never bawled!
{31702}{31738}Baloney.
{32053}{32090}Scut Farkus!
{32105}{32191}Scut Farkus! What a rotten name.|We were trapped.
{32193}{32262}There he stood, between us and the alley.
{32264}{32337}Scut Farkus, staring out at us|with his yellow eyes.
{32346}{32423}He had yellow eyes!|So help me God, yellow eyes.
{32795}{32860}Grover Dill, Farkus' crummy little toady.
{32862}{32897}Mean. Rotten.
{32899}{32957}His lips curled over his green teeth.
{32971}{33017}Randy lay there like a slug.
{33018}{33068}It was his only defense.
{33184}{33235}- Say "uncle."|- Uncle!
{33419}{33448}Louder!
{33493}{33564}In our world, you were|either a bully, a toady...
{33566}{33629}or one of the nameless rabble of victims.
{33633}{33660}All right.
{33665}{33702}Who's next?
{34264}{34353}In the jungles of kid-dom,|the mind switches gears rapidly.
{34362}{34423}Weeks ago I had sent away|for my Little Orphan Annie...
{34425}{34473}secret society decoder pen.
{34482}{34527}Oh, skunked again.
{34529}{34592}No matter. Today I had serious work to do.
{34608}{34659}"What I want for Christmas."
{34661}{34736}"What I want is a Red Ryder BB gun|with a compass in the stock...
{34738}{34782}"and this thing which tells time."
{34786}{34820}Wow, that's great.
{34822}{34894}"I think that everybody should have|a Red Ryder BB gun.
{34897}{34941}"They're very good for Christmas.
{34956}{35041}"I don't think that a football's|a very good Christmas present."
{35060}{35144}Oh, rarely had the words poured|from my penny pencil...
{35146}{35189}with such feverish fluidity.
{35318}{35356}I've won! I've won!
{35625}{35654}The Bumpus hounds.
{35686}{35749}Our hillbilly neighbors, the Bumpuses,|had at least...
{35751}{35796}785 smelly hound dogs.
{35810}{35901}And they ignored every other human being|on earth but my old man.
{35972}{36003}I won!
{36033}{36061}I won!
{36100}{36139}- What?|- A major prize!
{36141}{36169}I won!
{36188}{36261}Hey, look at that. Look at that.|A Western Union telegram.
{36262}{36339}Tonight, he's coming tonight.|Tonight. Hot damn, tonight!
{36341}{36381}What does this mean here?
{36383}{36425}It means it's coming tonight!
{36427}{36474}I called Ernie McClosky|at the freight depot.
{36475}{36543}He said the telegram was late,|the prize was already there...
{36545}{36597}he was going to send it on tonight.
{36601}{36681}Come on. Have a chew, fellas, on me.|It's my gift.
{36706}{36810}You know, maybe it'll be one of those|Spanish adobe houses down in Coral...
{36914}{36972}Serves you right, you smelly buggers.
{36974}{37026}Or it could be a bowling alley.
{37040}{37093}A guy down in Terre Haute|won a bowling alley.
{37096}{37161}How are they going to deliver|a bowling alley here tonight?
{37173}{37253}They could send the deed,|for cripesake. I mean...
{37260}{37341}I didn't expect they were going|to send the whole damn bowling alley.
{37342}{37410}Yeah, well. How about eating?|I'm starving to death.
{37417}{37482}Getting rich is hard work, kid. Come on.
{37671}{37724}Every family has a kid who won't eat.
{37732}{37829}My kid brother had not eaten voluntarily|in over three years.
{37873}{37954}Oh, Randy, don't play|with your food, eat it!
{38024}{38080}Starving people would be happy|to have that.
{38089}{38130}Can I have some more red cabbage?
{38297}{38373}Stop playing with your food,|or I'll give you something to cry about.
{38384}{38460}You better stop fooling around with it|and eat it or you'll be sorry.
{38589}{38621}Can I please have some more?
{38623}{38708}My mother had not had a hot meal|for herself in 15 years.
{38760}{38833}Meatloaf, double beetloaf.
{38847}{38885}I hate meatloaf.
{38916}{38976}All right. I'll get that kid to eat.
{38986}{39028}Where's my screwdriver|and plumber's helper?
{39030}{39086}I'll open up his mouth and I'll shove it in.
{39093}{39142}My mother was more subtle.
{39155}{39209}How do the little piggies go?
{39227}{39285}That's right. Oink, oink.
{39287}{39366}Now, show me how the piggies eat.|This is your trough.
{39371}{39440}Show me how the piggies eat.
{39450}{39517}Be a good boy.|Show Mommy how the piggies eat.
{40207}{40237}Oh, my.
{40248}{40295}Mommy's little piggy.
{40784}{40817}It's here.
{41002}{41021}Are you Parker?
{41034}{41085}- All right, sign here.|- Yeah. Well, what is it?
{41088}{41117}I don't know.
{41121}{41158}What's in it?
{41160}{41205}Here. Bring it in.
{41206}{41264}Okay, boys. Haul that on in here.|Move your tails.
{41266}{41349}Bring it right on in. Right here.|Bring it ahead. Straight ahead.
{41353}{41378}That's right.
{41406}{41433}Right.
{41434}{41501}Here, bring it right in, fellas.|That's it. Here we go.
{41504}{41554}A little more. Little more.
{41556}{41580}That's it.
{41647}{41688}Watch the lady.
{41897}{41937}Thanks a lot, guys.
{41939}{41971}Merry Christmas.
{41973}{42042}Get the crowbar and a hammer, Ralphie.|Go on.
{42080}{42128}"Fra-gi-ley."
{42133}{42213}- That must be Italian.|- I think that says "fragile."
{42219}{42257}Oh, yeah.
{42290}{42324}Here we go.
{42462}{42516}They did a job on this, you know?
{42666}{42721}No, here, Ralph, hold this.
{42875}{42949}There could be anything in there!
{42950}{42978}Jesus!
{43050}{43082}Maybe they forgot.
{43088}{43156}It's in there. It's gotta be in there.
{43318}{43375}- Would you look at that?|- What?
{43378}{43433}Would you look at that?
{43496}{43532}What is it?
{43550}{43582}It's a leg!
{43594}{43621}But what is it?
{43630}{43677}Well, it's a leg.
{43685}{43718}You know, like in a statue.
{43732}{43780}- Statue?|- Yeah, statue!
{43796}{43836}Yeah, statue!
{43842}{43877}Ralphie!
{43888}{43982}My mother was trying to insinuate herself|between us and the statue.
{43988}{44037}Holy smoke, would you...
{44038}{44086}Do you know what this is?
{44087}{44146}This is a lamp.
{44173}{44216}It was indeed a lamp.
{44218}{44286}Isn't that great? What a great lamp!
{44312}{44355}I don't know.
{44378}{44440}Here, hold it. Hold it. Here, go on.
{44450}{44506}The old man's eyes boggled...
{44535}{44572}overcome by art.
{44574}{44621}I know just the place for it.
{44622}{44694}Right in the middle|of our front room window!
{45146}{45189}Jesus, God.
{45286}{45340}- Honey?|- No. It's all right.
{45385}{45420}Let's see...
{45428}{45534}This goes to the radio|and this goes to the...
{45560}{45620}Well, it's just one too many.
{45715}{45739}Well, let's see.
{45741}{45818}The snap of a few sparks,|a quick whiff of ozone...
{45820}{45903}and the lamp blazed forth|in unparalleled glory.
{45909}{45968}Look at that! Will you look at that?
{45973}{46025}Isn't that glorious?
{46061}{46158}It's indescribably beautiful.|It reminds me of the Fourth of July!
{46178}{46202}Turn off all the lights.
{46203}{46250}I wanna see what it looks like|from the street.
{46251}{46318}- I'll go get the dining room.|- Couldn't we talk this over?
{46813}{46891}Move it a little bit to the right.|A little that way.
{46910}{46994}Just a little... More to the right.
{47020}{47068}Yeah. More. That's it. No, stop!
{47071}{47125}Right there. That's wonderful.
{47130}{47167}Parker, what is that?
{47169}{47214}Don't bother me now.|Can't you see I'm busy?
{47218}{47283}- Yeah, but what is that?|- It's a major award.
{47309}{47341}A major award?
{47366}{47427}Shucks, I wouldn't have known that.|It looks like a lamp.
{47429}{47510}It is a lamp, you nincompoop.|But it's a major award.
{47512}{47542}I won it.
{47547}{47613}- Damn, hell, you say you won it?|- Yeah.
{47618}{47681}Mind power, Sweed, mind power.
{47694}{47749}The entire neighborhood was turned on.
{47752}{47821}You should see what it looks like|from out here!
{47825}{47896}It could be seen|up and down Cleveland Street.
{47898}{47945}The symbol of the old man's victory.
{47948}{48000}Yeah, he won that. It's a major award.
{48002}{48085}Isn't it about time|for somebody's favorite radio program?
{48126}{48181}Holy smokes, it was 6:45.
{48185}{48237}Only one thing that|could've dragged me away...
{48238}{48334}from the soft glow of electric sex|gleaming in the window.
{48632}{48687}Kids, it's Little Orphan Annie time.
{48689}{48753}Brought to you by rich, chocolaty Ovaltine.
{48768}{48799}I could still taste it.
{48841}{48884}Hey, you turned the light off!
{49284}{49366}I knew I was handing Miss Shields|a masterpiece.
{49375}{49457}Maybe Miss Shields, in her ecstasy,|would excuse me from theme writing...
{49458}{49520}for the rest of my natural life.
{49706}{49747}You call this a paragraph?
{49757}{49857}Margins! Margins! "F"!
{49879}{49946}My life's work down the drain.
{49969}{50013}A semicolon, you dolt!
{50015}{50041}A period.
{50049}{50067}"F"!
{50070}{50176}Oh, I should weep|if I have to read one more "F"!
{50215}{50252}Ralphie Parker.
{50628}{50691}The theme I've been waiting for all my life.
{50702}{50740}Listen to this sentence.
{50750}{50854}"A Red Ryder BB gun with a compass|in the stock...
{50885}{50949}"and this thing which tells time."
{51000}{51029}Poetry.
{51030}{51065}Sheer poetry.
{51074}{51151}Ralph, an "A+."
{51162}{51200}My Ralph!
{51206}{51278}Oh, Ralphie, you've made me proud.
{51324}{51357}"A+"!
{52278}{52315}Is there something you want, Ralph?
{52331}{52394}I'm just turning in my theme.
{52446}{52486}Well, you can take your seat now.
{52559}{52588}Take your seat.
{53029}{53070}Come on, you guys.
{53210}{53255}Get in the car. Get in the car.
{53276}{53353}If we don't hurry|we're going to miss all the good trees!
{53414}{53488}My mother was about to make|another brilliant maneuver...
{53491}{53561}in the legendary battle of the lamp.
{53565}{53681}The epic struggle which followed lives|in the folklore of Cleveland Street...
{53683}{53714}to this very day.
{53717}{53783}Don't want to waste electricity.
{53788}{53829}"Don't want to waste electricity."
{53835}{53897}Come on, Ralphie. Get in the car.
{54033}{54081}You folks looking for a tree?|We got 300 trees.
{54083}{54161}This is the Christmas tree emporium|of the entire Midwest.
{54163}{54248}Now, you ain't gonna find no better tree|than this here tree.
{54258}{54307}This here tree is built to last.
{54310}{54353}Ain't no needles coming off this here tree.
{54430}{54482}Okay. Now here's a tree.
{54484}{54529}This here is a tree.
{54531}{54636}- That's a little skimpy in the front.|- Well, you just put it in the corner.
{54640}{54727}- Haven't you got a big tree?|- Hell, this ain't no tree.
{54740}{54797}Now here's a tree. This here is a tree.
{54837}{54924}- Wait'll the dogs see that one.|- Don't you think it's a little large?
{54926}{55005}Listen, Christmas only comes|once a year. Why not?
{55014}{55059}- How much?|- I'll knock off $2...
{55062}{55112}because I can see you're a man|who knows his trees.
{55114}{55195}This isn't one of those trees|that all the needles falls off, is it?
{55198}{55238}No, that's them balsams.
{55241}{55305}The old man loved bargaining|as much as an Arab trader...
{55307}{55349}and he was twice as shrewd.
{55350}{55408}You know, Dew Lock just bought|one of those brand new...
{55410}{55463}green plastic trees.
{55498}{55550}Darn thing looks like it was made out of...
{55566}{55611}green pipe cleaners.
{55626}{55677}This is a very nice tree.
{55681}{55739}I'll throw in some rope|and tie it to your car for you.
{55741}{55776}You got a deal.
{55781}{55801}Deal.
{56278}{56318}Damn it. Blow out!
{56521}{56558}Not again.
{56587}{56621}Four minutes!
{56623}{56660}Time me.
{56687}{56731}Actually, my old man loved it.
{56734}{56813}He always saw himself in the pits|at the Indianapolis Speedway...
{56815}{56839}in the 500.
{56960}{57030}My old man's spare tires|were actually only tires...
{57032}{57061}in the academic sense.
{57066}{57127}They were round.|They had once been made of rubber.
{57234}{57308}Ralphie, why don't you|go help your father?
{57318}{57357}- Really? Can I?|- Yes.
{57370}{57417}- Watch the traffic, there.|- Okay.
{57437}{57497}It was the first time that|it had been suggested that...
{57499}{57556}I go help my father with anything.
{57657}{57721}- What are you doing here?|- Mom says I should help.
{57761}{57822}Okay, sit down here. Squat down.
{57843}{57874}Yeah, that's it.
{57879}{57922}Here. Hold this.
{58010}{58094}No, not that way.|Come on, rat trap, hold it like this.
{58096}{58118}- How?|- Like this.
{58120}{58165}I want to put the nuts in it. There we are.
{58167}{58239}There's four of them. And we got it!
{58298}{58331}There it is.
{58337}{58413}That son of a gun.|I'm gonna get that dirty...
{58423}{58443}There we go.
{58473}{58529}For one brief moment|I saw all the bolts silhouetted...
{58530}{58591}against the lights of the traffic.|And then they were gone.
{58706}{58756}Oh, fudge!
{58773}{58818}Only I didn't say "fudge."
{58821}{58865}I said the word.
{58870}{58947}The big one.|The queen mother of dirty words.
{58955}{59013}The "f, dash, dash, dash" word.
{59014}{59060}What did you say?
{59130}{59195}That's what I thought you said.
{59254}{59297}Get in the car.
{59367}{59392}Go on.
{59394}{59448}It was all over. I was dead.
{59454}{59517}What would it be?|The guillotine? Hanging?
{59518}{59588}The chair? The rack?|The Chinese water torture?
{59600}{59696}Mere child's play|compared to what surely awaited me.
{59764}{59818}Everything go all right?
{60171}{60212}Eight minutes.
{60267}{60347}- Do you know what your son just said?|- No. What?
{60365}{60420}I'll tell you what he said. Randy!
{60508}{60525}Ralphie!
{60576}{60645}Over the years,|I got to be quite a connoisseur of soap.
{60648}{60749}My personal preference is for Lux,|but I found Palmolive had a nice...
{60753}{60803}piquant, after-dinner flavor.
{60805}{60889}Heady, but with just a touch|of mellow smoothness.
{60971}{61029}Lifebuoy, on the other hand...
{61077}{61121}You ready to tell me?
{61234}{61296}All right. Where did you hear that word?
{61300}{61393}Now I had heard that word at least|10 times a day from my old man.
{61398}{61453}My father worked in profanity the way...
{61455}{61513}other artists might work in oils or clay.
{61516}{61581}It was his true medium. A master.
{61582}{61640}But I chickened out. And I blurted out...
{61644}{61691}the first name that came to mind.
{61693}{61723}Schwartz!
{61764}{61802}I see.
{62075}{62144}Hello, Mrs. Schwartz? Yes, I'm fine.
{62157}{62240}Mrs. Schwartz,|do you know what Ralph just said?
{62283}{62306}No.
{62313}{62349}He said...
{62397}{62433}Not that!
{62438}{62469}Yes, that.
{62472}{62543}- Do you know where he heard it?|- Probably from his father.
{62546}{62605}No! He heard it from your son!
{62607}{62631}What?
{62825}{62855}What'd I do, Mom?
{62874}{62921}Why? I didn't do nothing!
{63042}{63129}Another shot of mysterious,|inexorable, official justice.
{63143}{63257}Rinse out and go to bed.|Am I glad you finished your homework!
{63262}{63332}Get right into bed,|and I don't want to see any lights on.
{63334}{63405}You are being punished,|so no comic book reading!
{63407}{63455}I'll come in, and if any lights are on...
{63458}{63527}Don't you give me that look!|You're gonna get it!
{64049}{64115}Three blocks away,|Schwartz was getting his.
{64154}{64212}There has never been a kid|who didn't believe...
{64217}{64309}vaguely but insistently,|that he would be stricken blind...
{64314}{64405}before he reached 21.|And then they'd be sorry.
{64663}{64706}Why, it's Ralph!
{64727}{64805}Well, come on in, Ralph.|Where've you been?
{64925}{64957}Why, he's carrying a cane!
{64958}{64994}What is it, Ralph? What happened?
{64996}{65041}Why, he's blind!
{65042}{65086}Blind? Oh, my God!
{65162}{65201}Ralph, is it something we did?
{65204}{65272}What brought you to this lonely state?
{65303}{65373}Ralph, please tell us no matter|how it hurts. What did we do?
{65394}{65437}Look, I can't.
{65438}{65484}Please, Ralph. I must know what we did.
{65490}{65535}What brought you to this?
{65763}{65815}Soap poisoning.
{65983}{66036}Oh, how could we do it?
{66052}{66125}I'll manage to get along, somehow.
{66149}{66207}- I'll never forgive myself.|- Thanks, Mom.
{66211}{66273}I told you not to use Lifebuoy.
{66299}{66342}I feel awful!
{66942}{66963}Thank you, Heather.
{66965}{67008}- Merry Christmas.|- Merry Christmas.
{67027}{67046}Thank you, Flick.
{67062}{67099}Merry Christmas, Miss Shields.
{67700}{67772}I just thought that you'd be getting tired|of the same old stuff.
{67775}{67853}Yes, truly, a little bribe never hurts.
{67866}{67916}Well, thank you very much, Ralph.
{68046}{68089}Merry Christmas.
{68155}{68185}Happy New Year.
{68254}{68303}You can take your seat now, Ralph.
{68869}{68942}The weeks of drinking gallons of Ovaltine,|in order to get...
{68945}{69027}the Ovaltine inner seal to send off|for my Little Orphan Annie...
{69029}{69113}secret decoder pen, was about to pay off.
{69132}{69197}I got it. "Master Ralph Parker."
{69198}{69240}My decoder pen!
{69345}{69380}All right!
{69507}{69575}"Be it known to all|that Ralph Parker is hereby appointed...
{69577}{69643}"a member of|the Little Orphan Annie secret circle and...
{69645}{69714}"is entitled to all the honors|and benefits occurring thereto."
{69727}{69778}Signed, Little Orphan Annie.
{69784}{69841}Countersigned, Pierre Andre!
{69850}{69881}In ink!
{69885}{69970}Honors and benefits.|Already at the age of nine.
{70110}{70142}Come on. Let's get on with it.
{70144}{70215}I don't need all that jazz|about smugglers and pirates.
{70240}{70301}Listen tomorrow night|for the concluding adventure of...
{70304}{70376}The Black Pirate Ship. Now it's time...
{70379}{70476}for Annie's secret message|for you members of the secret circle.
{70495}{70545}Remember, kids, only members of...
{70547}{70644}Annie's secret circle|can decode Annie's secret message.
{70650}{70724}Remember, Annie is depending on you.
{70746}{70798}Set your pins to B-2.
{70807}{70858}Here is the message.
{70865}{70897}12. 11. 2...
{70899}{70958}I am in my first secret meeting.
{70960}{71026}...25. 14. 11. 18.
{71052}{71070}16. 23...
{71072}{71113}Pierre was in great voice tonight.
{71114}{71205}I could tell that tonight's message|was really important.
{71214}{71240}...3. 25.
{71242}{71342}That's a message from Annie herself.|Remember, don't tell anyone.
{71434}{71505}Ninety seconds later|I'm in the only room in the house...
{71506}{71585}where a boy of nine can sit in privacy|and decode.
{71646}{71707}Ah! "B." I went to the next.
{71731}{71794}"E." The first word is "be"!
{71806}{71880}"S." It was coming easier now. "U."
{71923}{71985}Come on, Ralphie! I gotta go.
{72002}{72043}I'll be right down, Ma.
{72046}{72079}Gee whiz.
{72139}{72189}"T. O."
{72214}{72272}"Be sure to." Be sure to what?
{72274}{72340}What was Little Orphan Annie|trying to say? Be sure to what?
{72345}{72416}Ralphie! Randy has got to go!|Will you please come out?
{72418}{72484}All right, Ma! I'll be right out!
{72493}{72528}I was getting closer now.
{72530}{72602}The tension was terrible. What was it?
{72603}{72657}The fate of the planet|may hang in the balance.
{72670}{72719}Ralphie! Randy's gotta go!
{72742}{72805}I'll be right out, for crying out loud!
{72814}{72879}Almost there! My fingers flew.
{72882}{72921}My mind was a steel trap.
{72924}{72957}Every pore vibrated.
{72967}{73007}It was almost clear.
{73011}{73036}Yes!
{73208}{73237}Ovaltine?
{73327}{73369}A crummy commercial?
{73432}{73468}Son of a bitch!
{73522}{73582}I went out to face the world again.
{73586}{73620}Wiser.
{73930}{73965}Red cabbage?
{73967}{74038}No, that's for tomorrow night.|You love red cabbage, Ralphie.
{74085}{74132}You filthy system!
{74134}{74173}I hate it!
{74178}{74241}Schmucker! Smelly watt-buster!
{74450}{74554}What happened next|was a family controversy for years.
{74960}{74987}What was that? What happened?
{75089}{75123}What happened?
{75142}{75177}What broke?
{75184}{75226}I don't know what happened.
{75228}{75282}I was watering my plant and...
{75314}{75356}I broke your lamp.
{75720}{75760}Don't you touch that!
{75784}{75835}You were always jealous of this lamp.
{75853}{75888}Jealous of a plastic leg?
{75890}{75918}Jealous!
{75922}{75976}Jealous because I won.
{76022}{76057}That's ridiculous! Jealous?
{76061}{76088}Jealous of what?
{76118}{76149}That is...
{76150}{76245}the ugliest lamp|I have ever seen in my entire life!
{76254}{76292}Now it was out.
{76302}{76333}Get the glue.
{76346}{76401}We're out of glue.
{76456}{76560}You used up all the glue on purpose!
{76604}{76661}The old man stood quivering with fury...
{76664}{76722}stammering as he tried|to come up with a real crusher.
{76732}{76762}All he got out was:
{76764}{76795}Not a finger!
{77772}{77825}With as much dignity as he could muster...
{77828}{77889}the old man gathered up the sad remains...
{77892}{77952}of his shattered major award.
{77974}{78041}Later that night, alone in the backyard...
{78050}{78094}he buried it next to the garage.
{78109}{78149}Now I could never be sure...
{78160}{78246}but I thought that I heard|the sound of taps being played...
{78254}{78284}gently.
{78294}{78335}Know what I'm getting my old man|for Christmas?
{78337}{78380}- What?|- A rose that squirts.
{78382}{78431}People come to smell it, it squirts them.
{78435}{78520}- I'm getting my old man a Flit gun.|- A Flit gun?
{78600}{78628}Stop right there!
{78633}{78727}Ordinarily, if Dill so much as|said "hi" to you, you felt great...
{78739}{78824}warm inside.|But mostly he just hit you in the mouth.
{78830}{78894}I can't now, Grover.|I've gotta go see Miss Shields.
{78902}{78972}Hey, come here! Get over here!
{78982}{79029}Come on, you! Hey, come here!
{79065}{79087}You! Come here!
{79093}{79110}Who, me?
{79116}{79185}- No, your Aunt Tilly.|- Yeah, you. Get over here!
{79190}{79262}I left Flick to certain annihilation.
{79287}{79347}But BB gun mania knows no loyalties.
{79358}{79405}Uncle! Uncle!
{79525}{79549}All right, class.
{79560}{79622}I have your Christmas themes for you.
{79647}{79680}I'm pleased.
{79694}{79747}In general, you did very well.
{79823}{79908}However, I was disappointed|in the margins.
{79971}{80009}This is it.
{80042}{80095}"C+"? No, it can't be.
{80106}{80139}C+?
{80143}{80192}C+!
{80378}{80408}Oh, no!
{80436}{80476}"You'll shoot your eye out"?
{80532}{80579}My mother|must have gotten to Miss Shields.
{80583}{80621}There could be no other explanation.
{80628}{80727}You'll shoot your eye out.|You'll shoot your eye out.
{80789}{80878}Was there no end to this conspiracy|of irrational prejudice...
{80880}{80935}against Red Ryder and his peacemaker?
{80940}{81041}These multiplication questions|were most missed in our last math test.
{81043}{81080}Would you answer in unison, please?
{81088}{81157}I was surrounded by happier kids|who were all going to get...
{81160}{81197}what they wanted for Christmas.
{81206}{81236}...fifty-six.
{81971}{82008}Hey, four-eyes!
{82010}{82071}How'd you like your snowball sandwich?
{82087}{82135}Maybe you'd like another one!
{82268}{82292}Listen, jerk.
{82298}{82377}When I tell you to come, you better come!
{82406}{82465}What? Are you going to cry now?
{82470}{82560}Come on, cry baby, cry for me. Come on.
{82569}{82604}Cry!
{82608}{82651}Deep in the recesses of my brain...
{82654}{82735}a tiny red-hot little flame began to grow.
{83065}{83092}Something had happened.
{83096}{83192}A fuse blew|and I had gone out of my skull.
{83410}{83469}I'm telling my dad!
{83502}{83552}Hey, Ralphie!
{83717}{83768}Beat him up! Beat him up!
{84115}{84169}Did you hear what he said?
{84280}{84338}I have since heard of people under...
{84341}{84429}extreme duress speaking|in strange tongues.
{84436}{84519}I became conscious|that a steady torrent of obscenities...
{84523}{84626}and swearing of all kinds|was pouring out of me as I screamed.
{84838}{84876}Ralphie!
{85281}{85325}We're going home. Come on.
{85784}{85855}Calm down. Come on in here, Ralph.
{85963}{85997}Put your head down in here.
{86008}{86060}Come on, get down in here.
{86086}{86124}Settle down.
{86179}{86269}I want you to go in there|and lie down in your room for a while.
{86295}{86346}Ralphie, just settle down.
{86435}{86477}Here, dry off.
{86483}{86530}All right, calm down.
{86534}{86592}All right. Now go lie down.
{87066}{87127}The light was getting purple|and soft outside.
{87130}{87198}Almost time for my father|to come home from work.
{87687}{87725}What's the matter? What you crying for?
{87749}{87807}Daddy's going to kill Ralphie.
{87821}{87857}No, he's not.
{87860}{87893}Yes, he is, too.
{87895}{87932}No, he's not.
{87935}{88036}I promise you|Daddy is not going to kill Ralphie.
{88057}{88093}Why don't you come on out of there?
{88179}{88207}Would you like some milk?
{88252}{88293}You would?
{88453}{88481}Here you go.
{88513}{88538}All right?
{88555}{88621}I'll see you later? Okay. Bye.
{88916}{89004}I heard the car roar up the driveway,|and a wave of terror broke over me.
{89010}{89082}He'll know what I said,|the awful things that I said.
{89088}{89131}Get out of here!
{89147}{89225}Go on home, you mangy mutts.|Get out of here, you rotten, filthy...
{89232}{89249}Hey, Bumpus!
{89251}{89310}Get over here and get your stinking dogs!
{89337}{89410}Hey, come on, what's for dinner?|I'm starving to death.
{89887}{89950}Well, what happened today?
{89967}{89999}Where's your glasses?
{90034}{90073}Did you lose your glasses again?
{90082}{90105}Ralphie.
{90113}{90187}Remember, you left these|on the radio again.
{90193}{90261}Now try not to do that anymore.
{90285}{90323}So what else happened today?
{90359}{90393}Nothing much.
{90398}{90429}Ralphie had a fight.
{90449}{90467}A fight?
{90472}{90504}What kind of a fight?
{90562}{90612}You know how boys are.
{90651}{90697}I gave him a talking to.
{90730}{90811}I see that the Bears|are playing Green Bay on Sunday.
{90856}{90874}Oh, yeah.
{90878}{90927}Zudock's got tickets. I wish I had.
{90934}{90980}He'll freeze his keister off out there.
{91053}{91137}I slowly began to realize|I was not about to be destroyed.
{91146}{91181}The Chicago Bears.
{91196}{91232}The terror of the midway.
{91255}{91339}From then on, things were different|between me and my mother.
{91393}{91467}More like the Chicago Chipmunks, maybe.
{91471}{91498}But Bears, never.
{91545}{91569}Strange.
{91576}{91665}Even something as monumental|as "The Scut Farkus Affair"...
{91671}{91708}as it came to be known...
{91712}{91774}was pushed out of my mind|as I struggled for a way out...
{91776}{91844}of the impenetrable BB gun web...
{91845}{91895}in which my mother had me trapped.
{91903}{91929}Santa!
{91946}{91988}Yeah, I'll ask Santa.
{92005}{92045}Of course! Santa.
{92052}{92101}The big man. The head honcho.
{92107}{92137}The connection.
{92143}{92205}My mother had slipped up this time.
{92737}{92776}Mickey!
{93185}{93246}The store's going to close soon|and Santa will be gone.
{93248}{93344}Ralphie, Santa's not going anyplace.|Just be still!
{93576}{93634}Mom, this is just|the same old dumb parade as last year.
{93637}{93713}- Ralphie, will you please calm down.|- Mom...
{93723}{93762}- Hush!|- Shut up, Ralphie!
{93993}{94012}There he is!
{94013}{94065}Santa!
{94241}{94300}Have you been a good boy? Have you?
{94304}{94372}- Can we go now? Can we go?|- Yes, we can go now.
{94375}{94428}Come on, Ralphie.
{94707}{94757}Merry Christmas!
{94822}{94879}Come on, Randy, hurry up.
{95193}{95246}Ralphie, look over there.
{95248}{95320}See, the line's not so long. Get in it.
{95322}{95391}Take Randy's hand and hold on to him.|We'll see you later, okay?
{95393}{95469}Stay together, you hear?|And don't get lost.
{95554}{95580}Come on.
{95584}{95619}Let's go.
{95689}{95728}Young man.
{95732}{95759}Hey, kid.
{95768}{95853}- Just where do you think you're going?|- We're going up to see Santa.
{95874}{95941}The line ends here. It begins there.
{95951}{95992}Merry Christmas!
{95997}{96071}Come on, come up, boys and girls.|Hurry up.
{96213}{96247}Come on.
{96341}{96456}The line waiting to see Santa stretched|all the way back to Terre Haute!
{96471}{96517}And I was at the end of it.
{96573}{96622}I like Santa.
{96727}{96780}Let's face it. Most of us were scoffers.
{96781}{96902}Moments before zero hour,|it did not pay to take chances.
{96925}{97024}The chocolate snowman eats little boys.
{97065}{97103}My pretty...
{97109}{97160}What a tasty little boy.
{97190}{97260}Don't bother me. I'm thinking.
{97365}{97416}I like The Wizard of Oz.
{97495}{97541}I like the Tin Man.
{97642}{97740}If Higbee thinks I'm working one minute|past 9:00, he can kiss my foot.
{97780}{97829}Come on up on Santa's lap.
{97832}{97938}There's a wet one.|And what's your name, little boy?
{97943}{97967}Billy.
{97969}{97997}Come on, Randy.
{98035}{98112}And what do you want for Christmas,|Billy? A toy truck?
{98114}{98161}Get him off my lap.
{98164}{98207}Quick, get me a towel.
{98393}{98443}I hate the smell of tapioca.
{98480}{98562}Attention shoppers! It is now 9:00|and our store is closing.
{98572}{98642}9:00! Great Scott!|The store is gonna close!
{98667}{98729}Santa can't wait all night.
{98743}{98793}Come on up on Santa's lap.
{99028}{99055}Get moving, kid.
{99087}{99128}Quit dragging your feet.
{99442}{99480}Get him out of here.
{99737}{99779}Come on, kid.
{99925}{99984}Come on up.
{100233}{100316}And what's your name, little boy?
{100320}{100402}Hey, kid, hurry up, the store's closing!
{100475}{100587}Listen, little boy, we got|a lot of people waiting here, so get going!
{100640}{100711}What do you want for Christmas,|little boy?
{100720}{100770}My mind had gone blank.
{100773}{100827}Frantically I tried to remember|what it was I wanted.
{100829}{100866}I was blowing it, blowing it.
{100939}{101012}How about a nice football?
{101016}{101088}Football. What's a football?
{101105}{101156}Without conscious will,|my voice squeaked out:
{101158}{101188}Football.
{101201}{101239}Okay, get him out of here.
{101252}{101332}A football! Oh, no. What was I doing?
{101333}{101390}Wake up, stupid, wake up!
{101577}{101652}I want an official Red Ryder|carbine-action 200-shot...
{101654}{101680}range model air rifle.
{101729}{101770}You'll shoot your eye out, kid.
{101812}{101855}Merry Christmas.
{102232}{102275}I'll see you in Oz, folks.
{102481}{102528}Well, did you see Santa Claus?
{102541}{102600}Did you tell him|what you wanted for Christmas?
{102602}{102692}Did he ask you if you'd been|a good boy all year?
{102701}{102719}No.
{102739}{102790}Don't worry, he knows.
{102807}{102844}He always knows.
{102910}{102973}Merry Christmas.
{102996}{103052}Okay, down you go.
{103058}{103086}Bye, Chris.
{103334}{103389}That's fine.
{103409}{103470}Now wait a minute. All right. Plug her in!
{103516}{103555}Well, the green string is out.
{103557}{103612}No, the green is on. It's the blue that's out.
{103618}{103668}Oh, don't tell me what color it is.
{103671}{103699}I'm not color blind.
{103717}{103753}I'm not color blind, either.
{103841}{103877}There, see, I told you it was green.
{103937}{103988}Hold it! Don't anybody move!
{104024}{104057}Hold it right there!
{104073}{104115}A fuse is out.
{104127}{104216}The old man could replace fuses|quicker than a jackrabbit on a date.
{104217}{104256}He bought them by the gross.
{104398}{104440}Oh, Ralph.
{104447}{104504}My, isn't that pretty?
{104508}{104539}That son of a gun.
{104586}{104615}Yeah. No.
{104618}{104658}That star is crooked.
{104665}{104711}That star is perfectly straight.
{104771}{104821}- Oh, you've got to be careful.|- I am.
{104886}{104961}It's just... Let me get it fixed.|That's all right.
{105107}{105144}Perfect.
{105213}{105257}Oh, goodness, look at the time.
{105258}{105306}I hope Santa hasn't had to pass up|this house...
{105308}{105380}just because some boys|weren't in bed when he came by.
{105384}{105446}I thought I heard Santa's sleigh bells...
{105448}{105508}a little while ago,|going up the other side of the street.
{105534}{105566}All right, you two, upstairs.
{105593}{105642}Go on the double, on the double.
{105918}{105944}Okay, let's get them.
{107464}{107513}Randy, come on! Get up, Randy!
{107770}{107820}Santa Claus had come!
{107906}{107959}Wow! A truck! That's mine!
{107973}{108026}Wow, look over here! That's mine!
{108028}{108064}What's in here?
{108072}{108096}It's hard.
{108105}{108178}Fire truck. Oh boy, that's mine!
{108396}{108427}Does this raise?
{108791}{108821}Merry Christmas.
{108856}{108912}Merry Christmas, you two.
{108931}{108996}Randy, no.|Wait for Christmas to start, honey.
{109006}{109080}- I want to play Santa!|- Well, wait a minute, Randy.
{109081}{109127}He played Santa last year, didn't he?
{109136}{109187}Ralphie, you play Santa this time.
{109193}{109240}- Come on, Ralphie.|- Who should I start with?
{109247}{109302}Well, give Randy a present.
{109305}{109405}And, I think I see Aunt Clara's gift to you|right over there.
{109407}{109465}She always sends you|such wonderful presents.
{109474}{109539}Give me mine, Ralphie! Come on.
{109944}{110052}Christmas had come. Officially.|We plunged into the cornucopia...
{110053}{110146}quivering with desire|and the ecstasy of unbridled avarice.
{110149}{110184}Didn't I get a tie this year?
{110355}{110434}- A zeppelin!|- A can of Simonize.
{110453}{110529}Ralphie, what did Aunt Clara give you?|Show everybody.
{110653}{110674}I don't want to.
{110689}{110747}Ralphie, show everybody|what Aunt Clara gave you.
{110769}{110837}Aunt Clara had for years labored|under the delusion that...
{110839}{110948}I was not only perpetually four years old,|but also a girl.
{110960}{111053}She just always gives you|the nicest things, Ralphie.
{111161}{111228}Oh, isn't that sweet?
{111238}{111305}- Ralph, go upstairs and try it on you...|- I don't want to!
{111308}{111365}Go upstairs right now|and try on that present!
{111368}{111449}She went to all that trouble to make it!|Now go on.
{111633}{111733}While Ralphie is changing,|I'm going to play Santa Claus.
{111734}{111773}Now, let me see what can I find.
{111778}{111864}I see something! Randy.
{111869}{111912}This is for you, honey.
{111933}{111979}And this is for Daddy.
{112049}{112066}Here.
{112068}{112113}From me to you.
{112167}{112211}Thanks a lot.
{112221}{112274}I wonder what it could be?
{112298}{112370}Only one way to find out, isn't there?
{112377}{112429}Well, it's a blue ball!
{112469}{112512}It's a bowling ball.
{112536}{112566}Thank you, darling.
{112569}{112644}- Do you like it?|- Yes, very much. Very much.
{112661}{112682}Ralphie.
{112687}{112736}We're waiting.
{112740}{112777}Oh, come on, Mom.
{112788}{112828}Right now!
{113069}{113156}Lmmediately my feet began to sweat|as those two fluffy little bunnies...
{113158}{113239}with the blue button eyes|stared sappily up at me.
{113257}{113321}Come down here so I can see you better.
{113341}{113385}I just hoped Flick would never spot them...
{113388}{113467}as the word of this humiliation|could easily make life...
{113469}{113537}at Warren G. Harding School|a veritable hell.
{113595}{113619}Isn't that cute?
{113635}{113722}That is the most precious thing|I've ever seen in my life.
{113741}{113763}Shut up, Randy.
{113787}{113837}He looks like a deranged Easter bunny.
{113890}{113931}- He does not!|- He does, too.
{113933}{113973}He looks like a pink nightmare.
{113989}{114037}Are you happy wearing that?
{114045}{114069}Do you want to take it off?
{114074}{114104}You tell the kid to take it off.
{114105}{114177}You'll only wear it when Aunt Clara visits.|Go on and take it off.
{114178}{114218}Take it off!
{114305}{114350}My God, will you look at that mess?
{114360}{114418}- Who's going to clean the papers up?|- Not me.
{114452}{114508}- Randy did it last year.|- Well, he can do it again.
{114569}{114639}You know, this wine is not bad.|It's not good either, but...
{114641}{114702}- You want a sip?|- No, you don't.
{114737}{114764}Did you have a nice Christmas?
{114781}{114805}Yeah, pretty nice.
{114807}{114842}Did you get everything you wanted?
{114865}{114929}- Well, almost.|- Almost?
{114932}{114971}Well, that's life.
{114987}{115028}Well, there's always next Christmas.
{115105}{115138}That's funny.
{115160}{115203}What's that over there behind the desk?
{115228}{115250}Where?
{115252}{115296}Behind the desk,|against the wall over there.
{115364}{115396}Why don't you go check it out?
{115796}{115827}What did we put over there, honey?
{115862}{115912}Santa Claus probably put it.
{116797}{116889}Oh, it was beautiful.|I could hardly wait to try it out.
{116907}{116947}Do you know how to load it?
{117029}{117060}That's right.
{117244}{117265}Be careful.
{117277}{117311}Don't. They run all over.
{117475}{117505}Close her up. Close it up.
{117531}{117596}Can I try it out, Ma? Can I?
{117598}{117633}- Sure.|- Okay.
{117645}{117672}But outside.
{117674}{117719}I still say those things are dangerous.
{117755}{117817}Put on your galoshes and your coat.|It's cold out.
{117900}{117970}I had one when I was eight years old.
{117985}{118045}What if he hurts himself?|Ralphie, your coat!
{118077}{118170}- Don't shoot any animals or birds!|- Except the Bumpuses' dogs!
{118209}{118256}Be careful, Ralphie!
{118273}{118347}Now it is well known throughout|the Midwest that the old man...
{118349}{118393}is a turkey junkie.
{118414}{118517}A bona fide garley turkicanus freak.|A few days before Christmas...
{118521}{118619}his eyes would begin to gleam|with a wild and ravenous light.
{118714}{118817}Okay, Black Bart, now you get yours.
{119153}{119199}Oh, my God! I shot my eye out!
{119203}{119240}You'll shoot your eye out, kid.
{119252}{119354}You'll shoot your eye out,|you'll shoot your eye out!
{119377}{119453}Ralphie, you be careful out there.|Don't shoot your eye out!
{119455}{119504}She hadn't seen! She didn't know!
{119520}{119582}My eye's all right.|The BB must've hit my glasses.
{119616}{119657}My glasses! Oh, no!
{119658}{119698}Where are my glasses?
{119737}{119804}Few things brought such swift|and terrible retribution...
{119806}{119877}on a kid as a pair of busted glasses!
{119981}{120012}Stop!
{120305}{120340}Oh, no!
{120399}{120453}Oh, no! Pulverized.
{120738}{120838}For a moment I thought, I'll fake it.|They'll never know the lens is gone!
{120902}{120970}Randomly, my mind evolved|a spectacular plot.
{120975}{121027}Let's see, an icicle!
{121035}{121092}Falls off the garage and hits me in the eye!
{121100}{121201}It would work. It had to work.|Quickly, I whipped up some tears.
{121351}{121417}What's the matter, honey?|What happened?
{121419}{121449}What happened? Let me see that.
{121450}{121541}There was this icicle|and it fell off the garage and it hit me.
{121645}{121723}- What is it?|- No, it's okay. Just read your funnies.
{121823}{121859}Wake up, Randy.
{121973}{122005}Oh, God.
{122009}{122083}It hit my cheek and it broke my glasses.
{122095}{122184}And I tried to get out of the way, but I...
{122230}{122324}There, see, it's just a little bump.
{122333}{122372}You're lucky it didn't cut your eye.
{122374}{122425}Those icicles have been known|to kill people.
{122575}{122657}- What's going on up there?|- Nothing. We'll be right down.
{122664}{122728}You stay away from that turkey!|It's got an hour to cook.
{122730}{122758}You'll get worms!
{122882}{122918}But what about my glasses?
{122932}{122988}You can wear the old ones|with the crack in them...
{122989}{123033}until we get you some new ones.
{123101}{123147}I had pulled it off!
{123181}{123225}But I left my gun outside.
{123257}{123325}When you get dressed|you can go out and get your gun.
{123330}{123363}Hold that on there.
{123375}{123413}Life is like that.
{123425}{123543}Sometimes at the height of our reveries,|when our joy is at its zenith...
{123545}{123615}when all is most right with the world...
{123618}{123698}the most unthinkable disasters|descend upon us.
{124069}{124106}Oh, turkey!
{124462}{124539}Sons a bitches! Bumpuses!
{124904}{124990}The heavenly aroma still hung heavy|in the house. But it was gone.
{124993}{125066}All gone. No turkey.|No turkey sandwiches.
{125068}{125164}No turkey salad. No turkey gravy,|turkey hash, turkey a la king...
{125167}{125198}or gallons of turkey soup.
{125200}{125217}Gone.
{125219}{125249}All gone.
{125361}{125384}All right.
{125396}{125417}Everybody upstairs.
{125423}{125454}Get dressed.
{125506}{125542}We are going out to eat.
{126125}{126232}No! Not, "ra ra ra ra ra." "La la la la la."
{126241}{126261}Sing like this:
{126463}{126499}Try again.
{126739}{126768}Stop!
{126786}{126829}Sing something else.
{127154}{127180}No!
{127181}{127208}Stop!
{127229}{127283}Kitchen. Bring food. For customers.
{127502}{127534}Oh, I'm sorry.
{127602}{127642}It's a beautiful duck.
{127652}{127692}It really is.
{127711}{127750}But you see...
{127810}{127829}What?
{127831}{127878}It's smiling at me.
{128012}{128038}Okay?
{128072}{128106}Beautiful!
{128191}{128240}That Christmas would live|in our memories...
{128242}{128325}as the Christmas when|we were introduced to Chinese turkey.
{128359}{128407}All was right with the world.
{128909}{128965}Oh, honey, come over here. Look at this.
{128985}{129032}Is that beautiful!
{130133}{130236}Next to me in the blackness|lay my oiled blue-steel beauty.
{130254}{130310}The greatest Christmas gift|I had ever received...
{130313}{130347}or would ever receive.
{130375}{130463}Gradually, I drifted off to sleep,|pranging ducks on the wing...
{130465}{130525}and getting off spectacular hip shots.
