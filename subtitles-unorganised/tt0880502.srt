1
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:51,062
- Happy Bayram.
- Thanks. Same to you.

2
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:53,422
- Shall I fill her up?
- Please.

3
00:00:53,662 --> 00:00:56,102
Happy Bayram.

4
00:01:00,662 --> 00:01:02,701
- Happy Bayram.
- Thanks. Same to you.

5
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:05,221
Can you make me one with cheese?

6
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:16,181
- What's the music?
- Its Kazim Koyuncu.

7
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:19,141
- Don't you know him?
- No.

8
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:22,301
His music is very popular
here on the Black Sea Cost.

9
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,501
- I've never heard of him.
- He was from Artvin.

10
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:27,980
He died of cancer two years ago.

11
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,260
He was young. Like you.

12
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,060
All because of Chernobyl.

13
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,340
It's only now that's becoming clear.

14
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,300
120, Brother.

15
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,060
- And a toast?
- yes.

16
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,900
That makes 130.

17
00:02:08,579 --> 00:02:11,859
YETER'S DEATH

18
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:22,818
PROLETARIANS UNITE!

19
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:15,416
- Hello!
- Hello.

20
00:03:16,336 --> 00:03:18,376
It's 50 euros for half an hour.

21
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:22,016
- What's your name?
- Jessy.

22
00:03:23,016 --> 00:03:25,296
Jessy, do you do French?

23
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:31,536
French, Italian, Greek.
I'll do it international for you.

24
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:35,295
Bravo! Bravo

25
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:43,415
- Is music all right?
- Yes, why not?

26
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:46,215
- Have you got the 50 euros??
- Yes!

27
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:53,015
- Take your clothes off.
- Yes.

28
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:01,174
Are you Turkish?

29
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:05,094
- Could be...
- Now I'm ashamed.

30
00:04:07,694 --> 00:04:10,214
- What's your name, girl?
- I told you: Jessy.

31
00:04:10,454 --> 00:04:13,174
- And your real name?
- Yeter. That's enough.

32
00:04:13,414 --> 00:04:17,134
- What's enough?
- "Yeter" means "that's enough", right?

33
00:04:17,374 --> 00:04:20,854
I'm the youngest of seven sisters.
The baby of the family.

34
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,574
- What will you have to drink?
- Water. Water.

35
00:04:29,493 --> 00:04:30,893
Where are you from?

36
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:36,413
Uncle, have you come here
to chat or to fuck?

37
00:04:36,773 --> 00:04:39,093
Don't call me uncle,
that's embarrassing.

38
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,413
What shall I call you, then?

39
00:04:41,853 --> 00:04:43,653
"My divine lover"?

40
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,772
Please call me Ali.

41
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:54,973
- Ali?
- Yes.

42
00:05:01,212 --> 00:05:05,452
- Can you still get it up at your age?
- God willing.

43
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:08,612
Show me..

44
00:05:19,411 --> 00:05:22,571
- Goodbye, my rose!
- Take care, Brother Ali!

45
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:30,331
She was speaking Turkish!

46
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:41,571
Ladies and gentlemen,

47
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:45,010
in ten minutes
we will be arriving in Bremen.

48
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,370
we would like to say goodbye
to all the passengers leaving us here,

49
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,330
and wish you a good onward journey.

50
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:13,409
Hello, Papa!

51
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:17,969
Hello Nejat. Sit yourself down.
I'm still frying the fish.

52
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:20,569
- How are you?
- Good.

53
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:23,569
- And how are you?
- Fine.

54
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:26,849
I've brought you a book.

55
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:29,329
Whats it about?

56
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:32,529
Just read it.

57
00:06:39,928 --> 00:06:41,688
Are you having some raki?

58
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:44,168
- Sure, and you?
- Of course!

59
00:06:49,688 --> 00:06:52,368
I've got this Iranian friend, Mahmut.

60
00:06:52,608 --> 00:06:57,328
He's given me a tip
for the fourth race.

61
00:06:57,888 --> 00:07:01,887
- Which horse?
- "Ofliff Sunshine"

62
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:03,967
"Ofliff Sunshine"?

63
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:04,968
Yes.

64
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:08,887
The fifth horse in the fourth race?

65
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:13,047
Do you mean "Sunshine of Life"?

66
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:16,767
- What does that mean?
- The sun of life.

67
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:23,287
It would be nice if the sun of life
would shine for us someday.

68
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:26,946
It's an outsider, Papa.

69
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,086
We'll see, shall we?

70
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:40,985
Yes! Yes!

71
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:54,245
the odds were at least 70 to1!

72
00:07:56,005 --> 00:08:01,885
100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, there you are.- Thank you!

73
00:08:08,165 --> 00:08:11,645
Come on, I'll treat you
to ice cream, with chocolate.

74
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:19,724
Who are you screwing at the moment?

75
00:08:21,004 --> 00:08:24,004
A gentleman
doesn't talk about such matters.

76
00:08:25,324 --> 00:08:27,364
I didn't know that!

77
00:08:28,244 --> 00:08:31,684
It's impossible to talk to you
about anything, anyway.

78
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:36,684
Take care, Papa!

79
00:08:40,444 --> 00:08:42,843
Read the book, okay?

80
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:45,083
Yeah, yeah..

81
00:08:53,643 --> 00:08:56,323
Goethe was opposed to the revolution.

82
00:08:56,563 --> 00:08:58,643
Not on ethical grounds.

83
00:08:58,683 --> 00:09:01,683
but because it seemed to him
to be too uncontrollable.

84
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:06,803
Two quotes illustrate this.

85
00:09:07,443 --> 00:09:10,922
"Who wants to see a rose bloom
in the depths of winter?"

86
00:09:11,162 --> 00:09:14,762
"Everything to it's own time.
Leaves, buds, flowers.

87
00:09:15,282 --> 00:09:17,882
"Only a fool could want
this untimely intoxication."

88
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,282
Come on now, old man!

89
00:09:22,882 --> 00:09:25,842
I'm not 14 any more.
I don't come that quickly.

90
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:29,722
-I'll have to charge you extra.
- I'll give you another 50!.

91
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:31,362
Talk, talk!

92
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:35,241
Tell me to grab your arse!
- Grab my arse!

93
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,761
Come on now, my lion!

94
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:44,241
I want to ask you something:

95
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:46,841
are you happy with your job?

96
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:49,201
I can't complain.

97
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:52,561
Look, I live on my own.

98
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:55,841
m a pensioner, and a widower, too.

99
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:58,201
What's the saying?

100
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:01,560
"Only God is entitled to solitude."
- Bravo.

101
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,800
m looking for a woman to live with me.

102
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,800
I would pay you
as much as you earn here.

103
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,840
In return, you'd sleep only with me.

104
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,600
Agreed?

105
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,720
Have you fallen for me, old man?

106
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,520
You don't have to say anything now.

107
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,159
Here's my cell phone number.

108
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,359
Call me whenever you like.

109
00:11:15,477 --> 00:11:17,317
Peace be with you.

110
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,957
No understand.

111
00:11:19,837 --> 00:11:22,717
Don't lie to me!
We heard you speaking Turkish

112
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:25,757
Or are you ashamed of being a Turk?

113
00:11:27,877 --> 00:11:30,637
You're both a Moslem and a Turk,

114
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:32,797
understood?

115
00:11:34,397 --> 00:11:38,157
- I'm not deaf.
- Don't try to be funny

116
00:11:39,357 --> 00:11:42,076
You are on the false path.
Repent!

117
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:44,076
Repent!

118
00:11:46,556 --> 00:11:48,116
I repent!

119
00:11:49,156 --> 00:11:51,156
Don't let me catch you there again.

120
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,396
It would be a shame about you.

121
00:12:11,195 --> 00:12:12,195
Peace be with you.

122
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:18,595
-Peace be with you.
- And peace be with you.

123
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:29,275
He's made his move too soon.

124
00:12:45,554 --> 00:12:48,874
I'm glad you came

125
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:55,234
Will you treat me to a coke?
- Of course.

126
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:20,233
Are you hungry?

127
00:13:22,153 --> 00:13:25,712
When you said you'd pay me
what I earn in the brothel,

128
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:29,192
were you being serious?

129
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:31,352
How much do you earn?

130
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:35,672
I'm left with 3,000 a month.
Do you have that much?

131
00:13:37,432 --> 00:13:39,792
I'll get it.
- How?

132
00:13:42,272 --> 00:13:46,632
I get a pension
and I have a bit of money in the bank.

133
00:13:47,032 --> 00:13:50,951
I've got
some land and property back home.

134
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:57,031
And I have a son.
He's a professor at a German university.

135
00:13:57,591 --> 00:14:02,991
He earns good money.
If the worst comes to the worst, he'll help me.

136
00:14:09,991 --> 00:14:12,591
- Where are you from?
- Trabzon.

137
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,750
Look, I won't make any demands.

138
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,550
All I want is for you to live with me
and sleep with me.

139
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:31,230
I am hungry after all.
Take me out to dinner!

140
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,710
Fine, let's go!

141
00:14:57,109 --> 00:15:00,909
-The soup is delicious
- Enjoy

142
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:05,628
Where did you learn to cook so well?

143
00:15:07,068 --> 00:15:09,028
I taught myself.

144
00:15:09,668 --> 00:15:13,628
I was both mother and father to the boy.
I raised him.

145
00:15:14,908 --> 00:15:16,468
I'll do that.

146
00:15:24,228 --> 00:15:27,668
- You've brought him up well.
- Like a girl.

147
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:32,507
Here you are.

148
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:38,507
It's fish cakes. You'll love them.
Tuck in!

149
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:46,147
- How old were you when your mother died?
- He was six months.

150
00:15:47,627 --> 00:15:50,387
Didn't you ever remarry?

151
00:15:51,227 --> 00:15:54,907
I did, A widow with a daughter.

152
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:59,266
It didn't work out.
They're long gone.

153
00:16:01,986 --> 00:16:06,186
I'm a widow too
My husband was shot in Maras in 78.

154
00:16:06,426 --> 00:16:08,746
- You're from Maras?
- Yes.

155
00:16:10,306 --> 00:16:12,026
More coke?
- I'll get it.

156
00:16:12,426 --> 00:16:14,106
Sit yourself down.

157
00:16:14,546 --> 00:16:16,346
I'll fetch it!

158
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:26,865
- Are you really a professor?
- Yes.

159
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:43,265
I'll fetch the dessert.
- I'll go.

160
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:47,425
- No, youre a guest.
- If I'm to live here, I'll have to.

161
00:16:51,784 --> 00:16:57,344
- Don't drink so much, Papa.
-I'm not drinking so much.

162
00:17:10,384 --> 00:17:13,024
You got me drunk deliberately!

163
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:22,543
Keep your hands off her!

164
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:27,143
Are you okay?
- Piss off!

165
00:17:33,663 --> 00:17:37,463
Yeter! Where are you, Yeter?

166
00:17:40,182 --> 00:17:42,102
How did you two meet?

167
00:17:44,182 --> 00:17:45,822
He came to me.

168
00:17:47,582 --> 00:17:49,302
How?

169
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:50,942
Hasn't he told you?

170
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,342
I'm a lady of easy virtue.

171
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:03,862
What does that mean?

172
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:07,741
A whore. A hooker if you like.

173
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:17,501
Good night.

174
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:28,021
Nejat!

175
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,540
Papa!

176
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,980
Papa!

177
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,100
Hello, I'm Doctor Ozada.

178
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,860
Your father
has had a serious heart attack

179
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,899
His condition is critical.
He'll be in intensive care overnight.

180
00:18:56,139 --> 00:18:58,619
We'll have to open up an artery.

181
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:03,259
When his condition improves,
we II keep him in for observation.

182
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:05,539
Do you have any questions?

183
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:08,979
Can we see him now?
- I'm afraid not.

184
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:12,299
Any excitement
isn't good for him right now.

185
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:17,019
Come back again in the morning, okay?

186
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:45,898
Do you have any children?

187
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,617
I have a daughter.

188
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:55,057
How old is she?
-27.
II

189
00:20:00,537 --> 00:20:03,577
Does she know what you do?

190
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:07,937
She thinks I work in a shoe shop.

191
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:11,377
I often send her shoes.

192
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:20,096
I'd do anything for her.
I didnt t want her to be uneducated

193
00:20:20,336 --> 00:20:25,736
I wanted her to study
and become like you.

194
00:20:34,576 --> 00:20:37,256
Getting old is evil.

195
00:20:37,895 --> 00:20:40,895
There's absolutely
nothing good about it

196
00:20:43,095 --> 00:20:45,335
It's completely pointless.

197
00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:49,535
- You'll soon be okay.
- Right...

198
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:55,135
Don't forget to water the tomatoes.

199
00:21:03,614 --> 00:21:07,534
Nejat,
the tomatoes are ripe for plucking.

200
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:21,734
Do you want one
- Just to try.

201
00:21:27,894 --> 00:21:30,133
Let's take him some!

202
00:21:51,013 --> 00:21:52,853
What's wrong?

203
00:21:55,492 --> 00:21:57,612
I miss my daughter.

204
00:21:59,972 --> 00:22:03,332
haven t heard her voice for so long.

205
00:22:05,652 --> 00:22:08,412
I can't get hold of her for some reason.

206
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,690
Did you screw her?

207
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:16,529
Ive made some borek.
Would you like some?

208
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,609
Take that away.
I don't want any borek.

209
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:23,129
Don't look at me like that.

210
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:27,769
The doctor said   "No pastry"
- Then eat shit!

211
00:23:37,768 --> 00:23:41,648
You won t eat borek, but you smoke.
Are you taking the piss?

212
00:23:43,768 --> 00:23:48,688
Don't get involved in my life.
You have yours and I have mine.

213
00:23:59,928 --> 00:24:01,608
You re leaving?

214
00:24:06,927 --> 00:24:08,087
Wait!

215
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:12,847
Here, for the journey.

216
00:24:17,348 --> 00:24:18,348
Yeter!

217
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,407
Get me a raki, girl.

218
00:24:31,686 --> 00:24:36,926
We will soon be arriving in Hamburg.
Your connections...

219
00:25:14,485 --> 00:25:16,645
Did you screw him?

220
00:25:19,364 --> 00:25:21,044
I asked you a question.

221
00:25:23,844 --> 00:25:25,324
You're drunk.

222
00:25:26,604 --> 00:25:29,084
No, I'm not.

223
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,443
Don't touch me!

224
00:25:49,643 --> 00:25:51,163
Stop that!

225
00:25:52,323 --> 00:25:54,163
I've paid you,

226
00:25:54,403 --> 00:25:56,203
and I'll fuck you whenever I like!

227
00:25:56,523 --> 00:26:00,043
You don t own me
- Yes, I do.

228
00:26:00,883 --> 00:26:04,443
I own you!
Go on, give me a French job.

229
00:26:05,003 --> 00:26:07,563
You can shove your money up your arse.

230
00:26:10,242 --> 00:26:12,002
Where are you going?

231
00:26:16,082 --> 00:26:17,722
Where?

232
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:20,162
I'll go wherever I want.

233
00:26:20,722 --> 00:26:22,602
You're not going anywhere!

234
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,282
You're not going!

235
00:26:25,522 --> 00:26:30,642
-I'll say it again: I'll go wherever
I want. Ive seen plenty like you.

236
00:26:45,681 --> 00:26:47,001
Yeter?

237
00:26:51,561 --> 00:26:53,001
Yeter!

238
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,840
Then here to the right

239
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,080
And stop

240
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,079
So, then you go in here, please.

241
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:34,399
It's small.
- Yes, I'm afraid so.

242
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:36,799
So, in you go.

243
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:42,399
You II be given
your personal items later.

244
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:44,839
So, goodbye

245
00:29:39,034 --> 00:29:43,954
We haven t seen Ayten for a long time.
She's disappeared.

246
00:29:44,194 --> 00:29:47,994
- Since when?
- A few months.

247
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:50,434
That's her.

248
00:29:55,274 --> 00:29:58,434
Don't you have a more recent photo?
- No.

249
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:02,193
I'm afraid not.
have A look yourself.

250
00:30:03,673 --> 00:30:05,193
Very sweet.

251
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:10,353
- What was she studying?
- Economics...

252
00:30:10,593 --> 00:30:13,273
- Medicine...
- No, sociology.

253
00:30:13,513 --> 00:30:17,873
- Economics or medicine?
- To be honest, I don't know.

254
00:30:18,153 --> 00:30:19,313
Enough now!

255
00:30:19,993 --> 00:30:25,033
- Can I have the photo?
- But that s her mother...

256
00:30:25,473 --> 00:30:26,752
Take it.

257
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:32,952
- Where will you stay, cousin?
- In a hotel.

258
00:30:33,272 --> 00:30:35,512
Stay at my place.

259
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:36,952
It's okay.

260
00:30:37,232 --> 00:30:41,032
- I'm serious!
- I'm happy of my own.

261
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:45,152
How long will you stay
- Until I've found her.

262
00:30:45,392 --> 00:30:55,031
With 20 million people in Istanbul,
you're sure to run into her.

263
00:30:57,871 --> 00:31:00,311
Name? '
- Ayten Ozturk.

264
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:07,791
Place of origin?
- Either Maras or Istanbul.

265
00:31:08,911 --> 00:31:11,231
Kahramanmaras.......

266
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:32,910
One moment, please!

267
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:44,549
Name?
- Ayten Ozturk.

268
00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:49,749
I meant your name.
- Nejat. Nejat Aksu.

269
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:54,629
Why are you looking for the girl?

270
00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:57,789
I want to finance her studies.

271
00:31:58,629 --> 00:32:03,549
Why?

272
00:32:06,069 --> 00:32:09,948
Because knowledge and education
are human rights.

273
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:15,468
Well put.

274
00:32:20,748 --> 00:32:22,148
Listen, Nejat.

275
00:32:24,668 --> 00:32:27,868
The streets, these case files,

276
00:32:28,188 --> 00:32:31,028
are full of Kurdish children.

277
00:32:31,348 --> 00:32:34,027
We deal with them every day.

278
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:39,187
They are illiterate
and have to turn to violence.

279
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,987
Wouldn't you rather
help one of them?

280
00:32:54,947 --> 00:32:59,546
What good will this do?
- Maybe someone will get in touch.
.

281
00:33:24,844 --> 00:33:26,844
FOR SALE

282
00:33:27,345 --> 00:33:29,225
Shall we have a look inside?

283
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:34,665
I don't understand books.
Especially not in German.

284
00:33:34,905 --> 00:33:37,585
I'm off to my workshop.
If you need me, give me a call.

285
00:33:37,825 --> 00:33:39,825
I'll take the things with me.

286
00:33:41,785 --> 00:33:43,145
See you soon!

287
00:34:23,943 --> 00:34:25,383
Good afternoon.

288
00:34:29,223 --> 00:34:30,503
Good afternoon.

289
00:34:56,382 --> 00:35:00,742
Is this your bookshop?
- Yes.

290
00:35:02,062 --> 00:35:04,182
Do you like it?
- Yes

291
00:35:05,222 --> 00:35:06,462
..a lot.

292
00:35:06,861 --> 00:35:08,541
I'm glad.

293
00:35:08,781 --> 00:35:11,341
- My name's Markus Obermuller.
- I'm Nejat Aksu.

294
00:35:11,581 --> 00:35:13,461
Would you like a cay?
-  Thanks.

295
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:16,301
Or rather a mocha?
- Cay is fine.

296
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:19,821
Cengiz,
can you bring us two teas, please?

297
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:22,941
Please have a seat.

298
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:31,541
Why do you want to sell such a lovely shop?
- You know...

299
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,500
I've been here for about ten years.
And all of a sudden...

300
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,940
find myself missing Germany,
and the language as well,

301
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:48,220
Even though I'm surrounded by it here,
with all this literature.

302
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,180
But it's...

303
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,860
like a museum here.
Extinct. Like Latin.

304
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,819
And I've been feeling...

305
00:36:00,139 --> 00:36:01,379
homesick.

306
00:36:04,219 --> 00:36:05,979
I understand.

307
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:08,459
How much would it cost?

308
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:12,539
What was your name again?

309
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:14,459
Nejat Aksu.

310
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:16,859
What's your occupation?

311
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:22,259
m a professor of German in Germany.
- That would be funny, if...

312
00:36:24,738 --> 00:36:28,618
A Turkish professor of German
from Germany

313
00:36:28,858 --> 00:36:32,578
ends up in a German bookshop in Turkey.

314
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:35,218
That fits!

315
00:36:36,338 --> 00:36:38,098
Yes, maybe...

316
00:37:02,817 --> 00:37:06,017
So you're staying in Turkey
for the time being.

317
00:37:07,457 --> 00:37:08,577
Yes.

318
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:10,377
What about your work?

319
00:37:12,777 --> 00:37:15,056
Maybe teaching isn t my calling.

320
00:37:19,376 --> 00:37:20,856
What about your father?

321
00:37:23,096 --> 00:37:26,056
A murderer is not my father.

322
00:38:52,053 --> 00:38:56,293
LOTTE'S DEATH

You know that is punishable.
