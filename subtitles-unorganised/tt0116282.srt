1
00:02:42,527 --> 00:02:48,204
Fargo, North Dakota

2
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:30,158
I'm Jerry Lundegaard.

3
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:33,716
- You're Jerry Lundegaard?
- Yah.

4
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:38,085
- Shep Proudfoot said...
- He said you'd come at 7.30. What gives????????????

5
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:39,759
Shep said 8.30.

6
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:42,645
We've been here an hour.
He's peed three times already.

7
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:48,040
Aw. I'm sure sorry. Shep told me 8.30.
It was a mix-up, I guess.

8
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:51,119
- You got the car?
- Yah, you bet. Its out in the lot there.

9
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:55,246
- Brand-new, burnt-umber Ciera.
- Yeah, OK. Well, sit down, then.

10
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:59,398
I'm Carl Showalter.
This is my associate, Gaear Grimsrud.

11
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:00,886
Yah. How ya doin'?

12
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:05,040
- So, we all set on this thing, then?
- Sure, Jerry. Why wouldn't we be?

13
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:10,406
Yeah, no, I'm sure you are. Shep vouched
for you. I've got every confidence in you.

14
00:04:15,447 --> 00:04:18,166
I guess thats it, then. Here are the keys.

15
00:04:18,247 --> 00:04:19,885
No, thats not it, Jerry.

16
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:23,164
- Huh?
- The new vehicle, plus $40,000.

17
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:28,924
Yah, but the deal was the car first, then
the $40,000, like as if it was the ransom.

18
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:31,760
- I thought Shep told you.
- Shep didn't tell us much.

19
00:04:31,847 --> 00:04:34,919
- Well, OK. Its...
- Except that you'd be here at 7.30.

20
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:37,805
- Yah, that was a mix-up.
- Yeah. You already said that.

21
00:04:37,887 --> 00:04:41,436
Yah. But its not
a whole pay-in-advance deal.

22
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:45,600
See, I give you a brand-new vehicle
in advance, and then...

23
00:04:45,687 --> 00:04:48,247
- I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
- OK.

24
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:50,318
I'm not gonna sit here and debate.

25
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:53,922
I will say this, though. What Shep told us
didn't make a lot of sense.

26
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:56,805
Oh, no, its real sound. Its all worked out.

27
00:04:57,607 --> 00:05:00,883
- You want your own wife kidnapped?
- Yah.

28
00:05:02,287 --> 00:05:04,005
You...

29
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:08,160
My point is, you pay the ransom,
what, 80,000 bucks?

30
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:11,922
I mean, you give us half the ransom -
40,000. You keep half.

31
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:14,601
Its like robbin' Peter to pay Paul.
Makes no sense.

32
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:17,997
OK. See, its not me paying the ransom.

33
00:05:18,087 --> 00:05:22,285
The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy.
Her dad, he's real well-off.

34
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:25,404
- Now, I'm in trouble.
- What kind of trouble you in, Jerry?

35
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:30,402
Well, thats... I'm not gonna get into...
See, I just need the money.

36
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:34,162
- Now, her dad, he's real well-off.
- So why not just ask him for the money?

37
00:05:34,247 --> 00:05:36,966
- Or your fucking wife.
- Or your fucking wife, Jerry.

38
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:38,844
Well...

39
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:40,918
Its all part of this...

40
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:45,366
They don't know I need it, see.
OK, so there's that.

41
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:49,042
And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.
So there's that on top, then.

42
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:51,595
- These are personal matters.
- Personal matters?

43
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:54,599
Yah. Personal matters that needn't...

44
00:05:54,687 --> 00:06:00,284
OK, Jerry. You're tasking us
to peftorm this mission, but you won't...

45
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:02,642
You won't...

46
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:06,480
Oh, fuck it. Lets take a look at that Ciera.

47
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:12,676
Minneapolis, Minnesota

48
00:06:13,927 --> 00:06:17,363
- Hon!
- Hi, hon. Welcome back.

49
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,516
- How was Fargo?
- Yah. Real good.

50
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:23,722
Dad's here.

51
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:30,637
- How ya doin', Wade?
- Yah. Pretty good.

52
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:32,718
- What you watchin' there?
- Gophers.

53
00:06:32,807 --> 00:06:35,002
Who they playin'?

54
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:45,879
- Is he stayin' for supper, then?
- Yah, I think so. Dad?

55
00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:47,764
- What?
- You stayin' for supper?

56
00:06:47,847 --> 00:06:49,644
Yeah.

57
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:57,439
- May I be excused?
- What?

58
00:06:57,527 --> 00:06:59,802
- You done there?
- Uh-huh. I'm going out.

59
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:02,765
- Where are you going?
- Just McDonald's.

60
00:07:02,847 --> 00:07:04,838
- Back at 9.30.
- OK.

61
00:07:05,287 --> 00:07:09,439
He just ate. He didn't finish. He's going
to McDonald's instead of finishing here.

62
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:13,117
- He sees his friends there. Its OK.
- Its OK, McDonald's?

63
00:07:13,207 --> 00:07:16,756
What do you think they do there?
They don't drink milkshakes!

64
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:18,838
Its OK, Dad.

65
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:28,361
Wade, have you had a chance to think
about that deal I was talkin' about?

66
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:31,803
- Those 40 acres there on Wayzata?
- You told me about it.

67
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:35,277
Yah. You said you'd think about it.
I understand its a lot of money.

68
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:38,200
Its a heck of a lot.
What did you want to put there?

69
00:07:38,287 --> 00:07:40,881
- A lot. Its a limited...
- I know its a lot.

70
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:45,757
- I mean a parking lot.
- Yeah, well, $750,000 is a lot.

71
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:50,682
- Yeah, well, its a chunk, but...
- I had two lots. Lost a lot of money.

72
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:55,921
- Yah, but the difference...
- Why not show it to Stan Grossman?

73
00:07:56,007 --> 00:07:58,601
Stan'll say no dice.
Thats why you pay him.

74
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,326
I'm askin' you here, Wade.

75
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:04,956
This could work out real good
for me and Jean and Scotty.

76
00:08:05,047 --> 00:08:07,277
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.

77
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:23,962
Where is Pancake's House?

78
00:08:24,847 --> 00:08:27,839
- What?
- We stop at Pancake's House.

79
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:31,237
You nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast.

80
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:34,922
I gotta go to a place where
I can get a shot and a beer and steak.

81
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:37,237
Not more fucking pancakes. Come on.

82
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:43,998
Oh, come on, man.

83
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:47,363
OK, here's an idea.

84
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:51,122
We can stop outside of Brainerd.
I know a place there we can get laid.

85
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:53,880
- I'm fuckin' hungry now.
- Yeah, yeah. Jesus.

86
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:58,677
I'm saying we can stop, get pancakes
and then we'll get laid. All right?

87
00:09:11,287 --> 00:09:14,120
We sat right here in this room
and went over this.

88
00:09:14,207 --> 00:09:18,120
- Yah, but that TruCoat...
- I said I didn't want any TruCoat.

89
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:23,679
Yah, but I'm saying, that TruCoat, you
don't get it, you get oxidation problems...

90
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:27,806
You're sitting there talking in circles
like we didn't go over this already.

91
00:09:27,887 --> 00:09:30,924
- Yeah, but this TruCoat...
- We had a deal for $19,500.

92
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:36,240
Darned if you didn't tell me you'd get me
this car without the sealant for $19,500.

93
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:39,956
- All right, I'm not saying I didn't.
- You called me and said you had it.

94
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:42,686
"Ready to make delivery" you says.

95
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:46,885
And here you are and you're
wasting my time and my wife's time.

96
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:50,277
And I'm paying $19,500
for this vehicle here.

97
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:52,323
All right.

98
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:54,443
I'll talk to my boss.

99
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:01,160
See, they install that TruCoat
at the factory. There's nothing we can do.

100
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:03,556
But I'll talk to my boss.

101
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:06,236
These guys here. These guys.

102
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:10,000
Its always the same. Its always more.

103
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:16,879
- You going to the Gophers on Sunday?
- Oh, you betcha.

104
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:19,117
You wouldn't have an extra ticket?

105
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:22,203
You kiddin'?

106
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:25,164
Well.

107
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:31,479
He's never done this before, but seein' as
its special circumstances an' all,

108
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:34,639
he says I can knock $100 off that TruCoat.

109
00:10:36,007 --> 00:10:37,838
One hundred?

110
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:42,001
You lied to me, Mr Lundegaard.
You're a bald-faced liar.

111
00:10:42,087 --> 00:10:43,759
Bucky, please.

112
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:46,156
A fucking liar.

113
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:47,839
Bucky, please.

114
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:52,681
Where's my goddamn chequebook?
Lets get this over with.

115
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:55,078
Where is it?

116
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:32,564
From Hollywood,
The Tonight Show, star...

117
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:36,322
I am talking about your potential.

118
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:40,117
You're not a C student.

119
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:41,481
Yeah.

120
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:43,922
Yet you're gettin' C grades.

121
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:46,840
Its that disparity there
that concerns your dad and me.

122
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:50,677
- You know what a disparity is?
- Yeah!

123
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:54,806
OK. Well, thats why we
don't want you goin' out for hockey.

124
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:58,520
Oh, man! Come on. Whats the big deal? 
It's just an hour....

125
00:11:59,807 --> 00:12:00,762
Hold on.

126
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:03,077
- Whats the big deal?
- Hello.

127
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,044
- Yeah, hi, hon.
- Oh, hi, Dad.

128
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:08,517
- Is Jerry around?
- Yah. Hon? Yah, he's here.

129
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:12,043
- I'll catch him for ya. Hon? Its Dad.
- OK.

130
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:14,561
- Look, Dad, there's no fucking way...
- Scotty!

131
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:17,400
Hey, lets watch that language there.

132
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,762
- How ya doin' there, Wade?
- Whats goin' on?

133
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:22,122
Nothin', Wade. How ya doin' there?

134
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:25,677
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal.
He says its pretty sweet.

135
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:27,962
- No kiddin'?
- Might be interested.

136
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:33,280
No kiddin'? I'd need the cash pretty quick
there, in order to close the deal.

137
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:38,077
Come by at 2.30. We'll talk about it. If your
numbers are right, Stan says its sweet.

138
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:39,964
- Stan, you know, Grossman.
- Yah.

139
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:42,038
- 2.30.
- Yah. OK.

140
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,044
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?

141
00:12:58,127 --> 00:13:01,756
Say, you know those two fellas you
put me in touch with up there in Fargo?

142
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:05,476
- Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
- Well, he had a buddy there. He...

143
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,603
- I don't vouch for him.
- Thats OK.

144
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:11,077
- I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
- Carl something.

145
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,442
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.

146
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:17,156
He's a buddy of the guy you vouch for,
so I'm not worrying.

147
00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:19,317
I gotta get in touch with him.

148
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:24,401
This deal I needed 'em for, I may not need
it any more. Something's happenin', see.

149
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:28,446
- Call him up.
- I did, and I haven't been able to get him.

150
00:13:28,527 --> 00:13:31,599
So I thought maybe you'd know
an alternate number.

151
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,598
- Nope.
- OK.

152
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,678
Well, real good, then.

153
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:57,881
Can you crack
a fuckin' window open, man?

154
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:04,642
You know, its proven second-hand smoke
is a carcino... You know, a cancer agent.

155
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:10,841
Look at that - Twin Cities.
Thats the IDS building, the big glass one.

156
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:15,443
The tallest skyscraper in the Midwest,
after the Sears in Chicago,

157
00:14:15,527 --> 00:14:18,280
or John Hancock Building, whatever.

158
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,756
Have you ever been to Minneapolis?

159
00:14:20,847 --> 00:14:22,246
Nope.

160
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,405
Would it kill you to say something?

161
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:29,876
- I did.
- "No"?

162
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:33,277
Thats the first thing you've said
in the last four hours.

163
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:38,566
Thats a fountain
of conversation, man. Thats a geyser.

164
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:42,084
I mean, whoa, daddy. Stand back, man.

165
00:14:43,127 --> 00:14:44,526
Shit.

166
00:14:44,607 --> 00:14:49,362
I'm sittin' here drivin' - I'm doin' all the
drivin', whole fuckin' way from Brainerd -

167
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:55,363
just tryin' to chat, you know, keep our
spirits up, fight the boredom of the road,

168
00:14:55,447 --> 00:14:59,645
and you can't say one fuckin' thing
just in the way of conversation?

169
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:03,721
Oh, fuck it. I don't have to talk either, man.

170
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:05,798
See how you like it.

171
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:13,525
Just total fuckin' silence.
Two can play at that game, smart guy.

172
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:15,598
We'll just see how you like it.

173
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:20,038
Total silence.

174
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:26,206
Mr Lundegaard, this is Reilly Diefenbach
from GMAC. How are you this morning?

175
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:30,280
- Real good. How you doin'?
- Good. You're hard to get on the phone.

176
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:33,518
Yah, its pretty darn busy here,
but thats the way we like it.

177
00:15:33,607 --> 00:15:38,442
Thats for sure. Now, I just need, on these
last financing documents you sent us,

178
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:40,518
I can't read the serial numbers.

179
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:45,317
Yah, but its OK. The loans are in place.
I already got the... What?

180
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:49,161
- $320,000. You got the money last month.
- Yah. So we're all set, then.

181
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:55,561
Yes, but the vehicles you're borrowing on,
I can't read the serial numbers. If you...

182
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:59,276
- But the deal's done. I got the money.
- Yes. We have an audit here.

183
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:03,360
I just have to know that these vehicles
you're financing with this money exist.

184
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:07,235
- Yah, well, they exist all right.
- Well, I'm sure they do.

185
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:10,603
But I can't read the serial numbers,
so if you could read me...

186
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:16,842
Yah, but, see... I don't have 'em in front
of me. Why don't I fax you over a copy?

187
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:20,397
Fax is no good. Thats what I have,
and I can't read the darn thing...

188
00:16:20,487 --> 00:16:23,285
Yah, OK. I'll have my girl
send you a copy, then.

189
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:28,361
OK. Because if I can't correlate this note
with the vehicles, I call back that money.

190
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:31,041
- Yah. How much money was that?
- $320,000.

191
00:16:31,127 --> 00:16:34,244
I gotta correlate that money
with the cars its being lent on.

192
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,205
- OK. No problem. I'll fax that over...
- No, no. Fax is...

193
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,245
- I mean send it. I'll shoot it over to you.
- OK, fine.

194
00:16:40,327 --> 00:16:42,318
OK. Real good, then.

195
00:16:48,327 --> 00:16:50,124
- We're with Katie Carlson.
- Hi.

196
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:53,244
Now, we just want to remind
all of our viewers at home

197
00:16:53,327 --> 00:16:57,605
that this March, for the second year in
a row, Katie and I, with Twin City Travel,

198
00:16:57,687 --> 00:17:00,360
will be leading
a two-week trip down the Nile.

199
00:17:00,447 --> 00:17:05,282
Its a terrific time. I know you've heard
about it. We want all of you to come with.

200
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:08,165
And thats the truth.

201
00:17:08,247 --> 00:17:11,478
OK, for those who've just joined us,
Katie is gonna show us

202
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:14,764
how to make Holidazzle eggs at home.

203
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:16,838
- Now, Katie, I gotta admit.
- What?

204
00:17:16,927 --> 00:17:21,398
I was a little bit surprised when I first
picked this up. This is an empty egg.

205
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:24,320
- Thats right, Dale.
- There was an egg in here, right?

206
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:26,921
- Yeah.
- OK, well, how do you...

207
00:17:27,007 --> 00:17:30,443
You don't have an empty chicken
somewhere that lays empty eggs?

208
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:34,076
No, no. I guarantee this was
an honest-to-goodness Grade A...

209
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:50,684
- Unguent.
- What?

210
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:52,917
I need unguent.

211
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:33,196
- Am I doin' it?
- Push it.

212
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:37,883
Shit.

213
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:34,560
- How're you, Stan? How ya doin', Wade?
- Good to see you again, Jerry.

214
00:19:34,647 --> 00:19:37,207
If the numbers are right,
this looks pretty sweet.

215
00:19:37,287 --> 00:19:40,836
- Oh, those numbers are right, all right.
- This is doable.

216
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,397
- Congratulations, Jer.
- Thanks, Stan. Its a pretty...

217
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:47,320
What kind of finder's fee
were you looking for?

218
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:54,407
The financials are pretty thorough, so
the only thing we don't know is your fee.

219
00:19:54,487 --> 00:19:58,321
My fee? Wade, what the heck
are you talkin' about?

220
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,443
- Stan and I are OK.
- Yah.

221
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:03,166
- We're good to load in.
- Yah.

222
00:20:03,247 --> 00:20:06,398
But we never talked about your fee
for bringing it to us.

223
00:20:06,487 --> 00:20:10,400
No, Wade, I was bringing you this deal
for you to loan me the money to put in.

224
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:12,478
Its my deal here, see.

225
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,442
We thought you were
bringing us an investment.

226
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:21,078
- Yah. Right.
- You're sayin'... What are you sayin'?

227
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:25,240
You're saying we put in all the money
and you collect when it pays off.

228
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:30,758
No, no, see, but I'd pay you back
the principal, and interest.

229
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,681
- Heck, I'd go one over prime.
- We're not a bank, Jerry.

230
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:39,841
If I wanted bank interest on $750,000, I'd
go to Midwest Federal, talk to Bill Diehl.

231
00:20:39,927 --> 00:20:41,519
- He's at Norstar.
- He's at...

232
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:45,805
No, no. But, see,
I don't need a finder's fee.

233
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:47,479
I need...

234
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:52,357
Finder's fee's, what, 10%? Heck, thats not
gonna do it for me. I need the principal.

235
00:20:52,447 --> 00:20:56,918
- We're not gonna give you $750,000.
- What the heck were you thinking?

236
00:20:57,007 --> 00:21:00,761
If I'm only getting bank interest,
I want complete security. Heck, FDIC.

237
00:21:00,847 --> 00:21:04,442
- I don't see nothing like that here.
- Yeah, but I...

238
00:21:06,447 --> 00:21:09,519
OK. I'd guarantee you your money back.

239
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:12,724
I'm not talking about
your damn word, Jerry.

240
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:16,083
- Jeez, what the heck are you...
- We're not a bank, Jerry.

241
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:20,877
Well, look, I don't wanna cut you out
of the loop, but this here's a good deal.

242
00:21:20,967 --> 00:21:25,643
I assume if you're not interested,
you won't mind if we move on it.

243
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:27,922
Independently.

244
00:22:25,087 --> 00:22:27,282
Dammit! Dammit!

245
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:58,164
Hon?

246
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:01,918
Got the groceries.

247
00:23:36,607 --> 00:23:39,440
Yah, Wade, its Jerry.

248
00:23:39,527 --> 00:23:41,324
I...

249
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:45,842
Wade, its Jerry.
I don't know what to do. Its Jean.

250
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:48,395
I don't know what to do. Its my wife.

251
00:23:48,487 --> 00:23:50,557
I don't know what to do. Its Jean.

252
00:23:52,687 --> 00:23:55,884
Yeah, Wade, its Jerry. I...

253
00:23:57,967 --> 00:24:03,360
Wade, its Jerry. I... We gotta talk.
Its somethin'... Aw, jeez, its terrible.

254
00:24:11,127 --> 00:24:13,118
Yes?

255
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:15,198
Yeah. Wade Gustafson, please.

256
00:24:49,727 --> 00:24:54,039
Shut the fuck up, or I'll throw you
back into the trunk, you know.

257
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:57,604
Jeez, thats more than
I've heard you say all week.

258
00:25:04,487 --> 00:25:06,364
Ah, shit.

259
00:25:09,047 --> 00:25:11,038
Oh, the tags.

260
00:25:15,687 --> 00:25:19,316
All right, its just the tags.
I never put my tags on the car.

261
00:25:22,047 --> 00:25:24,322
Don't worry. I'll take care of this.

262
00:25:47,527 --> 00:25:52,521
Keep it still back there, lady, or else
we're gonna have to, you know, shoot ya.

263
00:26:00,047 --> 00:26:02,686
Hey, I'll take care of this.

264
00:26:24,807 --> 00:26:26,798
How can I help you, Officer?

265
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:40,678
- This a new car, then, sir?
- Certainly is, Officer. Still got that smell.

266
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:44,241
You're required to display temporary tags,

267
00:26:44,327 --> 00:26:46,921
either in the plate area
or taped to the back window.

268
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:50,238
- Certainly.
- Can I see your licence and registration?

269
00:26:50,327 --> 00:26:52,318
Certainly.

270
00:26:54,367 --> 00:26:58,758
Yeah, I was gonna tape up the tag,
you know, to be in full compliance,

271
00:26:58,847 --> 00:27:01,884
but it must've...

272
00:27:01,967 --> 00:27:03,958
It must've slipped my mind.

273
00:27:05,247 --> 00:27:10,446
So maybe the best thing to do would be
to take care of that right here in Brainerd.

274
00:27:10,527 --> 00:27:14,236
- Whats this, sir?
- My licence and registration.

275
00:27:15,687 --> 00:27:17,678
Yeah, I wanna be in compliance.

276
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:24,005
I was just thinking we could
take care of it right here, in Brainerd.

277
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:32,359
Put that back in your pocket, please.

278
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:35,120
And step out of the car, please, sir.

279
00:27:58,007 --> 00:27:59,998
Shut the fuck up!

280
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:18,324
Whoa.

281
00:28:19,327 --> 00:28:21,318
Whoa, daddy.

282
00:28:23,207 --> 00:28:25,198
You'll take care of it.

283
00:28:29,247 --> 00:28:31,397
You are smooth smooth, you know.

284
00:28:33,207 --> 00:28:35,004
Oh, daddy.

285
00:28:36,607 --> 00:28:38,723
Just clear him off the road.

286
00:28:39,607 --> 00:28:41,404
Yeah.

287
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,798
Oh, jeez.

288
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,838
Hi, its Marge.

289
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:35,277
Oh, my. Where?

290
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:36,959
Yah.

291
00:32:37,807 --> 00:32:39,798
Aw, jeez.

292
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,362
OK, there in a jiff.

293
00:32:43,447 --> 00:32:45,438
Real good, then.

294
00:32:50,527 --> 00:32:52,324
OK.

295
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:55,840
You can sleep. Its early yet.

296
00:32:55,927 --> 00:32:57,918
- Gotta go?
- Yeah.

297
00:32:59,007 --> 00:33:01,237
I'll fix you some eggs.

298
00:33:01,327 --> 00:33:03,318
Thats OK, hon. I gotta run.

299
00:33:03,407 --> 00:33:05,602
You gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.

300
00:33:07,447 --> 00:33:09,438
I'll fix you some eggs.

301
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,438
Oh, hon, you can sleep.

302
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:14,518
You gotta eat a breakfast.

303
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:20,163
I'll fix you some eggs.

304
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:22,238
Ah, Norm.

305
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:31,081
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.

306
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:33,362
- Love you, Margie.
- Love you, hon.

307
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:07,398
- Hon.
- Yah?

308
00:34:07,487 --> 00:34:09,796
Prowler needs a jump.

309
00:34:28,047 --> 00:34:30,197
Hiya, Lou.

310
00:34:30,287 --> 00:34:33,040
Whoo! What ya got there?

311
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:35,766
Margie, thought you might
need a little warm-up.

312
00:34:35,847 --> 00:34:37,644
Thanks a bunch.

313
00:34:37,727 --> 00:34:40,161
Whats the deal?
Gary says triple homicide.

314
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:43,398
Yah. Looks pretty bad.
Two of 'em are over here.

315
00:34:43,487 --> 00:34:46,365
- Where is everybody?
- Well...

316
00:34:46,447 --> 00:34:48,642
Its cold, Margie.

317
00:34:49,927 --> 00:34:52,122
Watch your step, Margie.

318
00:35:01,207 --> 00:35:03,562
Aw, jeez. So...

319
00:35:03,647 --> 00:35:05,444
Aw, jeez.

320
00:35:05,527 --> 00:35:07,438
Here's the second one!

321
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:11,040
Its in the head and the hand there.

322
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:15,564
- I guess thats a defensive wound.
- Oh, yah?

323
00:35:16,607 --> 00:35:18,598
Where's the state trooper?

324
00:35:18,687 --> 00:35:22,475
Back there a good piece,
in the ditch next to his prowler.

325
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:24,364
OK.

326
00:35:24,447 --> 00:35:29,999
So we got a trooper pulls someone over,
we got a shooting, these folks drive by,

327
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:34,638
there's a high-speed pursuit, ends here,
and then this execution-type deal.

328
00:35:34,727 --> 00:35:36,206
Yah.

329
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:40,119
I'd be very surprised
if our suspect was from Brainerd.

330
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:41,606
Yah.

331
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:47,119
And I'll tell you what. From his footprint,
he looks like a big fella.

332
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:53,481
You see something down there, Chief?

333
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:56,479
No, I just think I'm gonna baft.

334
00:35:56,567 --> 00:35:58,558
Jeez.

335
00:35:58,647 --> 00:36:01,525
- You OK, Margie?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

336
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:06,002
Its just morning sickness.

337
00:36:08,047 --> 00:36:10,515
- Well, that passed.
- Yah?

338
00:36:10,607 --> 00:36:12,916
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.

339
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:14,918
You had breakfast yet, Margie?

340
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,804
Oh, yah.

341
00:36:16,887 --> 00:36:19,082
- Norm made some eggs.
- Yah?

342
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:22,282
Well...

343
00:36:22,367 --> 00:36:24,597
What now, do you think?

344
00:36:24,687 --> 00:36:26,564
Lets go take a look at that trooper.

345
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,955
- There's different footprints here, Lou.
- Yah?

346
00:36:32,047 --> 00:36:35,642
- Yah. This guy's smaller than his buddy.
- Oh, yah?

347
00:36:36,847 --> 00:36:39,884
- For Pete's sake.
- How's it look, Marge?

348
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:45,644
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there,
and he looks like a nice enough guy.

349
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:48,321
- Its a real shame.
- Yah.

350
00:36:51,447 --> 00:36:54,405
- Didn't monkey with his car there, did ya?
- No way.

351
00:36:54,487 --> 00:36:58,639
Somebody shut his lights. Guess the little
guy sat in there waiting for his buddy.

352
00:36:58,727 --> 00:37:01,321
- Yah. Would've been cold out here.
- Heck, yah.

353
00:37:01,407 --> 00:37:04,001
- Ya think, is Dave open yet?
- Dave?

354
00:37:05,087 --> 00:37:06,884
You think he's mixed up in this?

355
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:09,925
Oh, no. I just wanna get Norm
some night crawlers.

356
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,525
- Did you look in his citation book?
- Yah.

357
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:21,796
Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at
2.18am. Under plate number he put DLR.

358
00:37:21,887 --> 00:37:25,846
I figure they shot him before
he could finish filling out the tag number.

359
00:37:26,647 --> 00:37:29,957
So I got the state looking for a Ciera
with a tag startin' DLR.

360
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,880
They don't got no match yet.

361
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:36,880
I'm not sure that I agree with you 100%
on your police work there, Lou.

362
00:37:36,967 --> 00:37:38,764
- Yah?
- Yah.

363
00:37:38,847 --> 00:37:43,967
I think that vehicle there
probably had dealer plates. DLR.

364
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,446
Jeez.

365
00:37:51,447 --> 00:37:55,645
Lou, d'you hear the one about the guy
who couldn't afford personalised plates,

366
00:37:55,727 --> 00:37:59,242
so he went and
changed his name to J3L2404?

367
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:02,042
Yah, thats a good one.

368
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:12,442
Look, all's I know is you got
a problem, you call a professional.

369
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:17,840
No. They said no cops. They said
"You call your cops, we're gonna shoot..."

370
00:38:17,927 --> 00:38:21,522
Of course they'll say that.
Where's my protection? They got Jean.

371
00:38:21,607 --> 00:38:25,156
If I give 'em a million,
where's my guarantee they'll let her go?

372
00:38:25,247 --> 00:38:27,841
- Well, they...
- A million dollars is a lot of money.

373
00:38:27,927 --> 00:38:30,521
- They got my daughter.
- Think this thing through.

374
00:38:30,607 --> 00:38:33,405
You give 'em what they want,
why won't they let her go?

375
00:38:33,487 --> 00:38:36,399
You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.

376
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:40,002
Heck, you don't know.
You're just whistling Dixie here.

377
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:43,238
The cops can advise us on this.
I'm saying call a professional.

378
00:38:43,327 --> 00:38:45,318
No. No cops!

379
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:48,761
Thats final. This is my deal here, Wade.

380
00:38:48,847 --> 00:38:51,725
- Yeah...
- Jean is my wife here.

381
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:54,844
I gotta tell you, Wade,
I'm leaning to Jerry's viewpoint.

382
00:38:54,927 --> 00:38:57,805
- Well...
- We gotta protect Jean. These...

383
00:38:57,887 --> 00:39:01,402
We're not holding any cards.
They got 'em all, so they call the shots.

384
00:39:01,487 --> 00:39:03,682
- You're darned tootin'.
- Oh, dammit.

385
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:07,157
- I'm tellin' ya.
- Well, why don't we...

386
00:39:08,047 --> 00:39:10,800
Stan, I'm thinking
we should offer 'em half a million.

387
00:39:10,887 --> 00:39:14,277
Now, come on here!
No way, Wade. No way.

388
00:39:14,367 --> 00:39:16,676
- We're not horse-tradin' here, Wade.
- Yeah.

389
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:19,964
- We gotta just bite the bullet on this thing.
- Yeah.

390
00:39:21,407 --> 00:39:24,046
So whats the next step here, Jerry?

391
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:28,439
They're gonna call me with instructions
for a drop. I need the money by tomorrow.

392
00:39:28,527 --> 00:39:30,324
Dammit!

393
00:39:32,127 --> 00:39:35,164
- How was everything today?
- Yah. Real good now.

394
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:39,277
How you doin'?

395
00:39:39,367 --> 00:39:44,600
OK. Now, we'll get the money together.
Don't worry about it, Jerry.

396
00:39:44,687 --> 00:39:48,123
Now, do you want anyone at home
with you till they call?

397
00:39:48,207 --> 00:39:52,837
No, I... They were just supposed to be
dealing with me. They were real clear.

398
00:39:52,927 --> 00:39:56,681
You know, they said no one listening in.
They'll be watchin', you know.

399
00:39:56,767 --> 00:40:00,726
Maybe its all bull, but, like you said,
Stan, they're callin' the shots.

400
00:40:02,287 --> 00:40:04,801
Now, is Scotty gonna be all right?

401
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,876
Yah. Jeez, Scotty.

402
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:11,401
Yah. I'll go talk to him.

403
00:40:25,847 --> 00:40:28,122
How ya doin' there, Scotty?

404
00:40:28,207 --> 00:40:30,243
Dad.

405
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,557
What are they doin'?

406
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:36,037
- What do you think they're doin' to Mom?
- Its OK, Scotty.

407
00:40:36,127 --> 00:40:40,757
They're not gonna wanna hurt her any.
These men, they just want money.

408
00:40:41,087 --> 00:40:46,605
- What if something goes wrong, Dad?
- No, no, no. Nothing's going wrong here.

409
00:40:46,687 --> 00:40:51,442
Granddad and I, we're making sure
this gets handled right.

410
00:40:51,527 --> 00:40:55,076
- I really think we should call the cops.
- No, no.

411
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:59,240
No one can know about this thing.
We gotta play ball with these guys.

412
00:40:59,327 --> 00:41:02,239
- Stan Grossman'll tell ya the same thing.
- But, Dad...

413
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:06,684
We're gonna get Mom back for ya,
but we gotta play ball, you know.

414
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:10,922
Thats the deal here.

415
00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:17,126
So if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia,

416
00:41:17,207 --> 00:41:20,643
you just say Mom's down in Florida
with Pearl and Marty.

417
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:26,642
Thats the best we can do here.

418
00:42:08,807 --> 00:42:10,525
No!

419
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,719
Whoops!

420
00:42:50,807 --> 00:42:52,798
Thanks, Myra.

421
00:42:54,167 --> 00:42:56,237
- Mornin'.
- Carol.

422
00:42:56,327 --> 00:42:59,285
Oh, Janie, two more
of those Skin-So-Softs, please.

423
00:43:00,687 --> 00:43:04,760
- Hiya, hon.
- I brought you some lunch, Margie.

424
00:43:04,847 --> 00:43:07,156
- What are those, night crawlers?
- Yah.

425
00:43:07,247 --> 00:43:10,319
- Aw, thanks, hon.
- You bet. Thanks for lunch.

426
00:43:10,407 --> 00:43:12,921
Oh, yah, looks pretty good.

427
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,601
What have we got here? Arby's?

428
00:43:15,687 --> 00:43:18,247
- How's the paintin' goin'?
- Pretty good.

429
00:43:19,247 --> 00:43:23,923
- The Hautmans are entering a painting.
- Aw, hon, you're better than them.

430
00:43:24,007 --> 00:43:28,046
- They're real good.
- They're good, Norm. But you're better.

431
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:32,640
You think so?

432
00:43:32,727 --> 00:43:34,718
Hey, you got Arby's all over me.

433
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:40,637
- Hey, Norm. How's the paintin' goin'?
- Not too bad, you know.

434
00:43:40,727 --> 00:43:44,845
- How we doin' on that vehicle?
- No motels registered a Ciera last night.

435
00:43:44,927 --> 00:43:47,999
But the night before,
two men checked into the Blue Ox

436
00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:51,238
registering a Ciera
and leaving the tag space blank.

437
00:43:51,327 --> 00:43:53,443
- Jeez, thats a good lead.
- Yah.

438
00:43:53,527 --> 00:43:56,519
- Thats that truckers' joint on I-35?
- Yah.

439
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:00,198
Owner was on the desk then.
Said these two had company.

440
00:44:00,647 --> 00:44:03,115
- Oh, yah?
- Yah.

441
00:44:06,567 --> 00:44:10,606
- We both did. She went to college, too.
- I went to Normandale for about a year.

442
00:44:10,687 --> 00:44:12,882
- Yah, thats where we met.
- I dropped out.

443
00:44:12,967 --> 00:44:15,276
- Yah, she dropped.
- Yah.

444
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:17,676
- So where are you girls from?
- Chaska.

445
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:22,318
Le Sueur, but I went to high school
in White Bear Lake. Go, Bears.

446
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:26,476
OK. I want you to tell me
what these fellas look like.

447
00:44:26,567 --> 00:44:29,479
- The little guy was kinda funny-Iookin'.
- In what way?

448
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:33,355
- I don't know. Just funny-Iookin'.
- Can you be any more specific?

449
00:44:33,847 --> 00:44:36,680
I couldn't really say.
He wasn't circumcised.

450
00:44:37,887 --> 00:44:41,800
- Was he funny-Iookin' apart from that?
- Yah.

451
00:44:42,607 --> 00:44:46,122
So, you were having sex
with the little fella, then?

452
00:44:47,847 --> 00:44:50,441
- Anything else you can say about him?
- No.

453
00:44:50,527 --> 00:44:54,566
Like I say, he was funny-Iookin'.
More than most people, even.

454
00:44:54,647 --> 00:44:57,002
- What about the other fella?
- He was older.

455
00:44:57,087 --> 00:44:59,555
- He looked like the Marlboro Man.
- Oh, yah?

456
00:44:59,647 --> 00:45:04,357
Yah. But maybe I'm saying that
cos he smoked a lot of Marlboros.

457
00:45:04,447 --> 00:45:08,122
- Like a subconscious type of thing.
- Oh, yah, that can happen.

458
00:45:08,207 --> 00:45:10,926
- Hey, they were goin' to the Twin Cities.
- Oh, yah?

459
00:45:11,007 --> 00:45:13,202
Yah. Yah. Is that useful to ya?

460
00:45:13,287 --> 00:45:14,879
Oh, you betcha, yah.

461
00:45:14,967 --> 00:45:16,958
Yah.

462
00:45:18,247 --> 00:45:21,683
Come on! Goddammit!

463
00:45:24,007 --> 00:45:26,202
Jesus Christ.

464
00:45:26,287 --> 00:45:29,085
Come on, you fucking shit box.

465
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:32,562
Been here for days.

466
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,922
Goddammit, nothin' to do.

467
00:45:36,207 --> 00:45:38,482
Fucking TV doesn't even...

468
00:45:40,087 --> 00:45:43,682
Dammit, come on! Plug me in, man.
Give me a fucking signal.

469
00:45:45,607 --> 00:45:47,598
Goddammit!

470
00:45:49,407 --> 00:45:51,637
Unbelievable. Come on.

471
00:45:51,727 --> 00:45:53,524
God...

472
00:45:53,607 --> 00:45:54,801
Fuck!

473
00:45:54,887 --> 00:45:58,084
Come on, plug me into the ozone, baby.
Come on.

474
00:45:59,407 --> 00:46:01,398
Come on!

475
00:46:02,367 --> 00:46:04,835
Fuck. Fuck.

476
00:46:04,927 --> 00:46:06,645
Fuck! Fuck!

477
00:46:12,887 --> 00:46:17,324
The bark beetle
carries the worm to its nest,

478
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:20,797
where it will feed its young
for up to six months.

479
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:26,198
In the spring, the larvae hatch
and the cycle begins again.

480
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:28,642
Well.

481
00:46:28,727 --> 00:46:30,877
I'm turning in, Norm.

482
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:32,958
Oh, yeah?

483
00:46:35,047 --> 00:46:37,607
Here it is throwing off the larval envelope.

484
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:53,878
- Hello.
- Yah, is this Marge?

485
00:46:53,967 --> 00:46:56,356
- Yah.
- Margie Olmstead?

486
00:46:57,687 --> 00:46:59,757
Yah. Who's this?

487
00:46:59,847 --> 00:47:01,963
This is Mike Yanagita!

488
00:47:02,047 --> 00:47:04,436
You know, Mike Yanagita.
Remember me?

489
00:47:06,927 --> 00:47:08,519
Mike Yanagita?

490
00:47:08,607 --> 00:47:10,199
Yah!

491
00:47:10,287 --> 00:47:12,881
Well, yah.

492
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:15,925
Course I remember you.
How are ya doin'?

493
00:47:16,007 --> 00:47:19,636
- What time is it?
- Oh, jeez, its a quarter to eleven.

494
00:47:19,727 --> 00:47:23,436
- I hope I didn't wake you.
- No. Thats OK.

495
00:47:23,527 --> 00:47:25,882
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities.

496
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:28,765
I was watching on TV
about these shootings in Brainerd,

497
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:30,644
- and I saw you on the news.
- Yah.

498
00:47:30,727 --> 00:47:33,958
I thought "Jeez, is that Margie Olmstead?
I can't believe it."

499
00:47:34,047 --> 00:47:36,880
Yah. Thats me.

500
00:47:36,967 --> 00:47:38,559
Well, how the heck are ya?

501
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,639
OK, you know. OK.

502
00:47:41,727 --> 00:47:43,877
- Yah?
- Yah.

503
00:47:43,967 --> 00:47:46,765
- How are you doin'?
- Oh, pretty good.

504
00:47:47,927 --> 00:47:51,886
Aw, heck.
Its been such a long time, Mike.

505
00:47:52,887 --> 00:47:54,878
Its great to hear from ya.

506
00:47:57,847 --> 00:48:02,875
Yah, you got your... This is loaded
here. This has your independent...

507
00:48:02,967 --> 00:48:05,959
Your front-wheel drive,
rack-and-pinion steering,

508
00:48:06,047 --> 00:48:09,164
antilock brakes, alarm, radar.

509
00:48:09,247 --> 00:48:11,841
And I can give it to you
with a heck of a sealant.

510
00:48:11,927 --> 00:48:15,886
- This TruCoat stuff, itll keep the salt off.
- I don't need no sealant.

511
00:48:15,967 --> 00:48:17,764
Yah, you don't need that.

512
00:48:17,847 --> 00:48:22,967
Were you thinking of financing here?
You aware of this GMAC plan? Its super.

513
00:48:23,047 --> 00:48:25,641
- Got a call for you, Jerry.
- Yah, OK.

514
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:35,757
- Jerry Lundegaard.
- Jerry, got the phone to yourself?

515
00:48:35,847 --> 00:48:37,883
- Well, yah.
- You know who this is?

516
00:48:37,967 --> 00:48:41,642
Well, yah. I got an idea.
How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?

517
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,957
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.

518
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:46,766
Well, what do you mean?

519
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:51,318
Things have changed. Circumstances
beyond the... Acts of God, force majeure.

520
00:48:51,407 --> 00:48:53,602
What the... How's Jean?

521
00:48:55,527 --> 00:48:58,200
- Who's Jean?
- My wife. What the...

522
00:48:58,287 --> 00:49:01,723
She's all right, but there's three people
in Brainerd who aren't OK.

523
00:49:01,807 --> 00:49:04,640
What are you talking about?
Lets finish this deal here.

524
00:49:04,727 --> 00:49:07,480
Blood has been shed, Jerry.

525
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:10,559
- What the heck do you mean?
- Three people in Brainerd.

526
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:13,719
- Oh, jeez.
- Thats right. And we need more money.

527
00:49:13,807 --> 00:49:16,844
What are you talkin' about?
What have you got mixed up in?

528
00:49:16,927 --> 00:49:19,964
- We need more money...
- This was a no-rough-stuff deal.

529
00:49:20,047 --> 00:49:24,404
- Don't interrupt me. Shut the fuck up!
- Well, I'm sorry, but I just...

530
00:49:24,487 --> 00:49:28,275
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
We now want the entire $80,000.

531
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:32,599
- Oh, for Chrissake here.
- Blood's been shed. We've incurred risks.

532
00:49:32,687 --> 00:49:34,962
I'm coming to town tomorrow
for the money.

533
00:49:35,047 --> 00:49:37,402
Now, we had a deal here. A deal's a deal.

534
00:49:37,487 --> 00:49:41,844
Is it, Jerry? Ask those three poor souls
up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal. Ask 'em!

535
00:49:41,927 --> 00:49:45,283
- The heck do you mean?
- "Heck d'you mean?" See you tomorrow.

536
00:49:49,367 --> 00:49:51,358
- Yah.
- Jerome Lundegaard?

537
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:54,325
- Yah.
- This is Reilly Diefenbach at GMAC.

538
00:49:54,407 --> 00:49:57,001
Sir, I've not received those vehicle IDs.

539
00:49:57,087 --> 00:49:59,885
Yah. I... Those are in the mail.

540
00:49:59,967 --> 00:50:05,121
That may be. However, absent the receipt
of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon,

541
00:50:05,207 --> 00:50:07,926
I'll have to refer this matter
to our legal department.

542
00:50:08,007 --> 00:50:09,998
- Yah.
- My patience is at an end.

543
00:50:10,087 --> 00:50:11,486
- Yah.
- Good day, sir.

544
00:50:11,567 --> 00:50:13,364
Yah.

545
00:51:08,567 --> 00:51:11,559
Hi, Norm. How ya doin', Margie?

546
00:51:11,647 --> 00:51:14,525
- How's the fricassee?
- Pretty darn good. You want some?

547
00:51:14,607 --> 00:51:18,805
Oh, no. I got... Hey, Norm. I thought
you was goin' ice fishing up at Mille Lacs.

548
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,522
- Yah. After lunch.
- Ah.

549
00:51:22,607 --> 00:51:25,963
- What you got there?
- Oh. The numbers you asked for.

550
00:51:26,047 --> 00:51:30,757
Calls made from the lobby phone at the
Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.

551
00:51:30,847 --> 00:51:35,477
First one's a trucking company, second's
a private residence. A Shep Proudfoot.

552
00:51:35,567 --> 00:51:37,637
A what?

553
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:40,082
Shep Proudfoot. Thats a name.

554
00:51:43,087 --> 00:51:45,555
OK. Yah.

555
00:51:45,647 --> 00:51:49,606
- Think I'll take a drive down there, then.
- Oh, yah? Twin Cities?

556
00:51:52,127 --> 00:51:54,436
Oh, yah?

557
00:52:06,847 --> 00:52:09,600
Dammit, I wanna be a part of this thing.

558
00:52:09,687 --> 00:52:13,726
No. Wade, they were clear. They said
they'd call tomorrow with instructions,

559
00:52:13,807 --> 00:52:18,198
- and its gotta be delivered by me alone.
- Its my money. I'll deliver it.

560
00:52:18,287 --> 00:52:20,801
- What do they care?
- Wade's got a point there.

561
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:25,961
- I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
- No, no. See, they only deal with me.

562
00:52:26,047 --> 00:52:29,517
You feel this nervousness
on the phone there.

563
00:52:29,607 --> 00:52:32,167
They're very... These guys are dangerous.

564
00:52:32,247 --> 00:52:34,602
All the more reason. I don't want you...

565
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:37,565
With all due respect,
I don't want you mucking this up.

566
00:52:37,647 --> 00:52:40,161
- What?
- They want my money, they deal with me,

567
00:52:40,247 --> 00:52:43,523
or I go to a professional.
There's a million dollars here!

568
00:52:43,607 --> 00:52:47,122
- No, see...
- Jerry, you're not selling me a damn car!

569
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:49,562
Its my show here. Thats that.

570
00:52:51,127 --> 00:52:54,324
Its the way we prefer to handle it, Jerry.

571
00:52:59,767 --> 00:53:01,758
Hi. How ya doin'?

572
00:53:01,847 --> 00:53:05,840
- Real good. How you doin' today, ma'am?
- I'm doing really super there, thanks.

573
00:53:05,927 --> 00:53:08,487
I'm Mrs Gunderson. I have a reservation.

574
00:53:09,647 --> 00:53:12,207
Yup, you sure do, Mrs Gunderson.

575
00:53:12,287 --> 00:53:14,960
Is there a phone down here, ya think?

576
00:53:16,807 --> 00:53:18,399
Detective Sibert?

577
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:22,685
Yeah, this is Marge Gunderson
from up Brainerd. We spoke.

578
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:26,999
Yeah, well, actually I'm in town here.
I had to do a few things in the Twin Cities,

579
00:53:27,087 --> 00:53:31,638
so I thought I'd check in with ya about
that USFI search on Shep Proudfoot.

580
00:53:32,807 --> 00:53:34,843
Oh, yah?

581
00:53:34,927 --> 00:53:37,839
Well, maybe I'll go visit
with him if I have a...

582
00:53:37,927 --> 00:53:40,725
No, I can find that.

583
00:53:40,807 --> 00:53:43,640
Yah, well, thanks a bunch. Oh, say, say.

584
00:53:43,727 --> 00:53:48,278
Would you happen to know a good place
for lunch in the downtown area?

585
00:53:48,367 --> 00:53:50,562
The Radisson.

586
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:52,956
Oh, yah. Is it reasonable?

587
00:55:06,927 --> 00:55:10,476
- Hi. How ya doin'?
- Yeah. I decided not to park here.

588
00:55:11,527 --> 00:55:13,757
What? You decided not to park here?

589
00:55:13,847 --> 00:55:16,520
Yeah, I just came in.
I decided not to park here, so...

590
00:55:16,607 --> 00:55:18,962
But... Well, I'm sorry, sir...

591
00:55:19,047 --> 00:55:22,084
Yeah, I decided not to... I...

592
00:55:22,167 --> 00:55:25,284
I'm not... I decided not
to take the trip, as it turns out.

593
00:55:25,727 --> 00:55:29,322
Well, I'm sorry, sir.
We've still gotta charge you the $4.

594
00:55:30,567 --> 00:55:33,206
I just pulled in here.
I just fucking pulled in here.

595
00:55:33,287 --> 00:55:36,802
Well, but, see,
there's a minimum charge of $4.

596
00:55:36,887 --> 00:55:39,560
Long-term parking charges by the day.

597
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:48,797
I guess you think you're like an authority
figure, with that stupid fucking uniform?

598
00:55:49,687 --> 00:55:52,804
Fucking clip-on tie there.
Big fucking man, huh?

599
00:55:52,887 --> 00:55:56,482
These are the limits of your life.
Ruler of your little fucking gate.

600
00:55:56,567 --> 00:55:59,559
Here. There's your $4,
you pathetic piece of shit.

601
00:56:01,687 --> 00:56:04,963
- Where's Shep?
- Talking to a cop.

602
00:56:05,047 --> 00:56:08,198
- Cop?
- Said she was a cop.

603
00:56:10,807 --> 00:56:13,401
Do you remember getting a call
Wednesday night?

604
00:56:13,487 --> 00:56:14,681
Nope.

605
00:56:15,047 --> 00:56:19,165
- You reside at 1425 Freemont Terrace?
- Yup.

606
00:56:19,247 --> 00:56:22,239
- Anyone else residing there?
- No.

607
00:56:22,327 --> 00:56:26,366
Well, Mr Proudfoot, this call
came in past three in the morning.

608
00:56:26,447 --> 00:56:30,759
Its just hard for me to believe
you don't remember anyone calling.

609
00:56:30,847 --> 00:56:32,917
Now, I know you've had some problems.

610
00:56:33,007 --> 00:56:37,876
Struggling with the narcotics, some
other entanglements, currently on parole.

611
00:56:38,367 --> 00:56:40,801
- So?
- Well, associating with criminals,

612
00:56:40,887 --> 00:56:45,165
if you're the one they talked to, that right
there would be a violation of your parole.

613
00:56:45,247 --> 00:56:47,966
Would end you up back in Stillwater.

614
00:56:48,047 --> 00:56:51,483
I saw some rough stuff on your priors,
but nothing like a homicide.

615
00:56:51,567 --> 00:56:55,355
I know you don't wanna be
an accessory to something like that.

616
00:56:57,327 --> 00:57:01,559
So, you think you might remember
who those folks were who called ya?

617
00:57:09,487 --> 00:57:11,717
- Mr Lundegaard?
- Yeah.

618
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:15,641
- Could I take a minute of your time here?
- What is it all about?

619
00:57:15,727 --> 00:57:18,924
D'you mind if I sit down?
Carrying quite a load here.

620
00:57:19,447 --> 00:57:23,679
- You're the owner here, Mr Lundegaard?
- No, I... Executive sales manager.

621
00:57:23,767 --> 00:57:27,646
- You can help me. I'm Marge Gunderson.
- My father-in-law is the owner.

622
00:57:27,727 --> 00:57:32,562
Well, I'm a police officer from up
Brainerd investigating some malfeasance.

623
00:57:32,647 --> 00:57:37,846
I was wondering if you'd had any vehicles
stolen off the lot in the past two weeks.

624
00:57:39,087 --> 00:57:41,476
Specifically, a tan-coloured Ciera.

625
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,365
Mr Lundegaard?

626
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:51,678
Brainerd?

627
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:55,282
Yah, yah. Home of Paul Bunyan,
Babe the Blue Ox.

628
00:57:55,487 --> 00:57:57,478
Babe the Blue Ox.

629
00:58:01,047 --> 00:58:04,198
Yeah, you know,
we got that big statue up there.

630
00:58:06,367 --> 00:58:09,882
So, you haven't had any vehicles
go missing, then?

631
00:58:09,967 --> 00:58:11,559
No. No, ma'am.

632
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:16,998
Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch. I'll let you
get back to your paperwork, then.

633
00:58:30,287 --> 00:58:32,755
- Yah, get me Shep.
- He's not here right now.

634
00:58:32,847 --> 00:58:35,122
- What the heck d'you mean?
- He stepped out.

635
00:58:35,207 --> 00:58:37,004
- Where did he go?
- I'll get Arty.

636
00:58:37,087 --> 00:58:40,284
No, I don't need a mechanic.
I need a...

637
00:58:42,527 --> 00:58:46,361
Aw, jeez. I gotta talk to a friend of his.

638
00:58:46,447 --> 00:58:50,326
So have him...

639
00:58:52,007 --> 00:58:53,998
- What?
- Aw, jeez.

640
00:59:13,927 --> 00:59:15,645
Mike?

641
00:59:15,727 --> 00:59:17,524
Marge?

642
00:59:18,607 --> 00:59:20,006
Jeez!

643
00:59:20,087 --> 00:59:22,123
- Oh, you look great.
- Yeah, so do you.

644
00:59:22,207 --> 00:59:25,597
Oh, easy there, easy there.
Easy there, easy there.

645
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,882
You do, too. I'm expecting.

646
00:59:27,967 --> 00:59:30,527
Oh, I see that. Thats great.

647
00:59:30,607 --> 00:59:33,883
- Oh, what can I get ya?
- Oh, just a Diet Coke, please.

648
00:59:33,967 --> 00:59:36,117
- OK.
- Great.

649
00:59:36,207 --> 00:59:38,198
- This is a nice place.
- Yah.

650
00:59:38,287 --> 00:59:42,246
You know, its a Radisson,
so its pretty good. Yah.

651
00:59:46,527 --> 00:59:48,006
So...

652
00:59:48,087 --> 00:59:51,841
- You're living in Edina, then?
- Yah, yah, yah. A couple of years now.

653
00:59:51,927 --> 00:59:55,124
Its actually Eden Prairie,
that school district.

654
00:59:55,207 --> 00:59:58,119
So, Chief Gunderson, then!

655
00:59:58,207 --> 01:00:00,596
So, you married
Norm son-of-a-Gunderson.

656
01:00:00,687 --> 01:00:04,157
- Oh, yah. Long time ago.
- Great. Great.

657
01:00:04,247 --> 01:00:06,920
So, what brings you down...

658
01:00:07,007 --> 01:00:10,966
Are you down here on that homicide,
if you're allowed to discuss that?

659
01:00:11,047 --> 01:00:14,801
Oh, yah, yah. But there's not
a heck of a lot to discuss.

660
01:00:17,407 --> 01:00:21,082
Well, what about you, Mike?
Are you married? You got kids?

661
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:23,476
Yah, yah. Well...

662
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:26,035
I was married. I was married to...

663
01:00:26,127 --> 01:00:28,322
You mind if I sit over here?

664
01:00:28,407 --> 01:00:32,923
- I was married to Linda Cooksey.
- No, why not sit over there? I prefer that.

665
01:00:40,047 --> 01:00:42,561
- Sorry.
- Oh, no, no. Just so I can see ya.

666
01:00:42,647 --> 01:00:47,038
- Don't have to turn my neck.
- Oh, sure, sure. I understand.

667
01:00:47,127 --> 01:00:50,119
- I didn't mean to...
- No, no.

668
01:00:50,207 --> 01:00:52,198
Thats fine.

669
01:00:53,687 --> 01:00:56,155
Yah. Sorry. Sorry.

670
01:00:56,887 --> 01:01:02,200
So, I was married to Linda Cooksey. You
remember her. She was a year behind us.

671
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:06,166
Yeah, I think I remember her.
Yeah. She... Oh, yeah, yeah.

672
01:01:06,247 --> 01:01:07,839
So it didn't work out, huh?

673
01:01:07,927 --> 01:01:11,522
And then I've been working
for Honeywell for a few years now.

674
01:01:11,607 --> 01:01:16,362
- Oh, well, they're a good outfit.
- If you're an engineer, you can do worse.

675
01:01:16,447 --> 01:01:19,962
But its not...
Its nothing like your achievement.

676
01:01:20,287 --> 01:01:23,199
Oh, well, it sounds like
you're doing really super.

677
01:01:23,287 --> 01:01:26,279
Its not that things didn't work out.

678
01:01:26,367 --> 01:01:28,358
Its...

679
01:01:29,207 --> 01:01:32,438
Linda had leukaemia, you know.

680
01:01:32,527 --> 01:01:34,597
She was a... She passed away.

681
01:01:35,247 --> 01:01:37,238
No!

682
01:01:38,487 --> 01:01:41,081
- It was tough.
- There you go.

683
01:01:41,167 --> 01:01:44,079
It was long...

684
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:47,000
She fought real hard, Marge.

685
01:01:49,767 --> 01:01:51,962
What can you say?

686
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,277
Oh. Better times, huh?

687
01:01:56,367 --> 01:01:58,676
Better times.

688
01:02:00,167 --> 01:02:02,601
Oh, and then I saw ya on the TV

689
01:02:02,687 --> 01:02:06,157
and I remembered, you know,
I always liked you.

690
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:10,800
- Well, I always liked you, Mike.
- I always liked you so much.

691
01:02:13,847 --> 01:02:16,407
So, Mike, should we
get together another time?

692
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:18,842
No! I... I...

693
01:02:21,847 --> 01:02:24,520
I'm sorry. Its...

694
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:28,316
I shouldn't have done this.
I shouldn't have done this. I shouldn't.

695
01:02:28,407 --> 01:02:31,638
- I thought we'd have a really terrific time.
- Its OK, Mike.

696
01:02:31,727 --> 01:02:34,321
You were such a super lady.

697
01:02:34,407 --> 01:02:37,205
And then... I've been so Ionely.

698
01:02:40,407 --> 01:02:42,398
Its OK, Mike.

699
01:02:47,967 --> 01:02:51,642
Here's a song I dedicate
to all the ladies out here tonight.

700
01:02:52,327 --> 01:02:54,363
It goes like this.

701
01:03:05,487 --> 01:03:08,877
So, are you from around here?

702
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:12,362
Just in town on business.

703
01:03:12,447 --> 01:03:14,438
Just in and out.

704
01:03:16,047 --> 01:03:18,277
Just a little of the old "in and out".

705
01:03:19,727 --> 01:03:21,558
What do you do?

706
01:03:26,007 --> 01:03:30,842
Have you been to the Celebrity Room
before with other clients?

707
01:03:30,927 --> 01:03:33,805
I don't think so. Its nice.

708
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:36,321
Yeah, well, it depends on the artist.

709
01:03:36,407 --> 01:03:39,843
You know, Jose Feliciano,
you got no complaints.

710
01:03:39,927 --> 01:03:42,077
Waiter.

711
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:45,397
Is he deaf?

712
01:03:45,487 --> 01:03:50,038
So, how long you work for
the escort service?

713
01:03:50,127 --> 01:03:52,118
I don't know. A few months.

714
01:03:53,127 --> 01:03:55,357
Find that work interesting, do you?

715
01:03:56,487 --> 01:03:58,682
What are you talkin' about?

716
01:03:58,767 --> 01:04:00,325
All right.

717
01:04:00,407 --> 01:04:02,967
Come on. I'm hearing bells.

718
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,197
Come on, huh?

719
01:04:05,287 --> 01:04:07,801
All right. Where were ya?

720
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:15,561
Shep, what the hell you doin'?
I'm bangin' that girl. Ow!

721
01:04:15,647 --> 01:04:19,560
Fucking asshole! Get the fuck outta here!

722
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:24,960
Put me back in Stillwater, you little
fucking shithead. Get the fuck outta here!

723
01:04:25,047 --> 01:04:29,563
Yo! Cut that shit out, man. I'm trying
to get some goddamn sleep here.

724
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:32,323
- Come on, brother.
- Fuck you.

725
01:04:38,687 --> 01:04:40,882
- Fuck you.
- Animals!

726
01:04:40,967 --> 01:04:44,482
- Animals! Animals!
- Stay away from me, man.

727
01:04:44,567 --> 01:04:48,321
Hey, smoke a fucking peace pipe!
Wait! Don't you dare fucking hit me!

728
01:04:55,407 --> 01:04:58,763
- Fucking little weasel. Fuck you, man.
- Stop it!

729
01:04:58,847 --> 01:05:02,556
You fucking, motheftucking,
son-of-a-bitching, fucking cock!

730
01:05:02,647 --> 01:05:06,606
Jesus Christ!
You fucking shitbag motheftucker!

731
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:12,276
- Yah?
- Jerry, I'm through fucking around.

732
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:15,439
- You got the fucking money?
- Yah, I got the money, but...

733
01:05:15,527 --> 01:05:20,681
Don't you fucking "but" me! Meet me
at the Radisson parking ramp, 30 minutes,

734
01:05:20,767 --> 01:05:23,235
- and we wrap this thing up.
- OK, but...

735
01:05:23,327 --> 01:05:27,878
You're there in 30 minutes or I shoot you,
your fucking wife and all your children.

736
01:05:27,967 --> 01:05:30,083
And I shoot 'em in the back of their heads.

737
01:05:30,167 --> 01:05:33,079
- OK, you stay away from Scotty now.
- Got it?

738
01:05:33,167 --> 01:05:35,158
OK. Real good, then.

739
01:05:58,767 --> 01:06:00,439
Dad?

740
01:06:00,527 --> 01:06:02,916
- Its OK, Scotty.
- Where you goin'?

741
01:06:03,927 --> 01:06:06,043
I'll be back in a minute.

742
01:06:06,127 --> 01:06:10,120
If Stan calls, you just tell him
I went to Embers.

743
01:06:12,407 --> 01:06:15,365
OK. Here's your damn money.

744
01:06:17,047 --> 01:06:19,197
Now where's my daughter?

745
01:06:19,287 --> 01:06:20,686
You...

746
01:06:20,767 --> 01:06:24,043
You goddamn punk!

747
01:06:39,327 --> 01:06:41,318
Who the fuck are you?

748
01:06:43,687 --> 01:06:45,279
Who the fuck are you?

749
01:06:45,367 --> 01:06:47,961
I've got your damn money.
Where's my daughter?

750
01:06:49,407 --> 01:06:52,717
I am through fucking around.
Drop that fucking briefcase!

751
01:06:52,807 --> 01:06:56,436
- Where's my daughter?
- Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry?

752
01:06:56,527 --> 01:06:58,757
I gave simple fucking instructions!

753
01:06:59,047 --> 01:07:01,959
Where's my damn daughter?
No Jean, no money.

754
01:07:02,047 --> 01:07:05,596
- Drop that fucking money!
- No Jean, no money!

755
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:09,158
Is this a fucking joke here?

756
01:07:17,607 --> 01:07:18,881
Jeez.

757
01:07:18,967 --> 01:07:22,357
You happy now, asshole?
Whats with you people?

758
01:07:22,607 --> 01:07:24,598
You fucking imbeciles.

759
01:07:32,047 --> 01:07:34,038
You fucking shot me!

760
01:08:47,887 --> 01:08:49,764
May I have your ticket, please?

761
01:08:49,847 --> 01:08:52,077
Open the fucking gate!

762
01:09:29,647 --> 01:09:31,638
Oh, jeez.

763
01:10:00,127 --> 01:10:02,357
- Dad?
- Yah?

764
01:10:02,447 --> 01:10:04,438
Stan Grossman called.

765
01:10:04,527 --> 01:10:06,757
- Yeah, OK.
- Twice.

766
01:10:09,127 --> 01:10:11,687
Is everything OK?

767
01:10:11,767 --> 01:10:13,166
Yah.

768
01:10:14,767 --> 01:10:16,758
Are you callin' Stan?

769
01:10:18,327 --> 01:10:20,318
Well, I'm...

770
01:10:21,367 --> 01:10:23,562
I'm going to bed now.

771
01:10:58,767 --> 01:11:00,758
- How ya doin'?
- Mr Mohra?

772
01:11:00,847 --> 01:11:02,644
- Yah.
- Officer Olson.

773
01:11:02,727 --> 01:11:05,036
Yah. Righto.

774
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:09,200
Well, so I'm tendin' bar down there
at Ecklund and Swedlin's last Tuesday.

775
01:11:09,287 --> 01:11:13,041
This little guy's drinkin' and he says
"Where can a guy find some action?"

776
01:11:13,127 --> 01:11:15,436
"I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake."

777
01:11:15,527 --> 01:11:18,997
I says "What kind of action?" He says
"Woman action. What do I look like?"

778
01:11:19,087 --> 01:11:22,682
And I says "What do I look like?
I don't arrange that kind of thing."

779
01:11:22,767 --> 01:11:28,205
He says "I'm goin' crazy at the lake." And
I says "But this ain't that kind of place."

780
01:11:28,287 --> 01:11:31,757
He says "Oh, I get it.
So you think I'm a jerk for askin'?"

781
01:11:31,847 --> 01:11:34,919
Only he don't use the word "jerk".
Then he calls me a jerk.

782
01:11:35,007 --> 01:11:39,080
Says the last guy who thought he was
a jerk is dead now, so I don't say nothin'.

783
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:44,366
He says "What d'you think of that?" I says
"Don't sound like a good deal for him."

784
01:11:44,447 --> 01:11:48,565
- You got that right!
- Says "Guy's dead, and not of old age."

785
01:11:48,647 --> 01:11:51,923
Then he says "Jeez,
I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake."

786
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:53,281
White Bear Lake?

787
01:11:53,367 --> 01:11:57,599
Ecklund and Swedlin's closer to
Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.

788
01:11:57,687 --> 01:12:01,202
Anyway, he's drinkin' at the bar,
so I don't think a great deal of it.

789
01:12:01,287 --> 01:12:05,997
But Mrs Mohra heard about the homicides
down here and thought I should call it in,

790
01:12:06,087 --> 01:12:08,476
so I called it in.

791
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:12,363
End of story.

792
01:12:12,447 --> 01:12:17,999
- What did this guy look like, anyways?
- Oh, he's a little guy, kinda funny-Iookin'.

793
01:12:18,087 --> 01:12:21,318
- In what way?
- Oh, just in a general kind of way.

794
01:12:21,407 --> 01:12:26,720
OK, thanks. You're right, its probably
nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.

795
01:12:26,807 --> 01:12:28,206
Sure.

796
01:12:28,287 --> 01:12:33,156
- Looks like she'll turn cold tomorrow.
- Oh, yah. Got a front comin' in.

797
01:12:33,247 --> 01:12:35,636
Yah, you got that right.

798
01:12:53,807 --> 01:12:55,445
Jesus Christ.

799
01:15:07,367 --> 01:15:09,562
I'm leavin' this morning, back to Brainerd.

800
01:15:09,647 --> 01:15:13,003
- Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
- But you think he's all right?

801
01:15:13,087 --> 01:15:15,521
- I saw him last night and...
- What did he say?

802
01:15:15,607 --> 01:15:20,556
Its nothing specific. It just seemed like
it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin'...

803
01:15:20,647 --> 01:15:22,239
- His wife?
- Linda.

804
01:15:22,327 --> 01:15:24,124
- Who?
- Linda Cooksey.

805
01:15:24,207 --> 01:15:26,402
No. No, no, they weren't...

806
01:15:26,487 --> 01:15:32,198
He was bothering Linda for a year, really
pestering her. Wouldn't leave her alone.

807
01:15:32,287 --> 01:15:33,959
So...

808
01:15:34,047 --> 01:15:36,561
He didn't... They never...

809
01:15:36,647 --> 01:15:38,797
No. No, they never married.

810
01:15:38,887 --> 01:15:42,641
- Mike's had psychiatric problems.
- Oh, my.

811
01:15:42,727 --> 01:15:46,515
Yah. He's been struggling.
He's living with his parents now.

812
01:15:47,527 --> 01:15:51,122
- Oh, jeez.
- Linda's fine. You should call her.

813
01:15:51,207 --> 01:15:54,404
Jeez. Well... jeez.

814
01:15:56,167 --> 01:15:58,158
Thats a surprise.

815
01:16:07,447 --> 01:16:09,244
Hello?

816
01:16:47,767 --> 01:16:50,679
Mr Lundegaard. Sorry to
bother you again. Can I come in?

817
01:16:50,767 --> 01:16:53,645
Yah. No, I'm kinda busy here.

818
01:16:53,727 --> 01:16:56,002
I understand. I'll keep it real short, then.

819
01:16:56,087 --> 01:16:58,885
I'm on my way outta town,
but I was wondering...

820
01:16:58,967 --> 01:17:01,959
- Mind if I sit down? Carryin' a load here.
- No. I...

821
01:17:02,047 --> 01:17:05,084
Its this vehicle I asked you about.
I was wondering...

822
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:08,125
Yah, like I told ya,
we haven't had any vehicles go missing.

823
01:17:08,407 --> 01:17:10,523
OK. Are ya sure?

824
01:17:11,207 --> 01:17:13,198
Cos, I mean, how do you know?

825
01:17:13,567 --> 01:17:18,595
The perpetrators were driving a car with
dealer plates and called someone here,

826
01:17:18,687 --> 01:17:22,726
so it would be quite a coincidence
if they weren't, you know, connected.

827
01:17:22,807 --> 01:17:25,685
- Yah, I see.
- So how do you...

828
01:17:25,767 --> 01:17:29,521
- Have you done an inventory recently?
- The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

829
01:17:29,607 --> 01:17:33,395
- How can you be sure without doin' a...
- Well, I would know.

830
01:17:33,487 --> 01:17:36,638
- I'm the executive sales manager.
- Yah, but I understand...

831
01:17:36,727 --> 01:17:41,323
- We run a pretty tight ship here.
- I know, but how do they establish that?

832
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:44,558
Are the cars counted daily,
or what kind of a routine here?

833
01:17:44,647 --> 01:17:47,286
Ma'am! I answered your question.

834
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:54,364
- I'm sorry, sir?
- Ma'am, I answered your question.

835
01:17:55,087 --> 01:17:59,478
I answered the darn...
I'm cooperating here, and there's no...

836
01:18:02,807 --> 01:18:07,119
Sir, you have no call to get snippy
with me. I'm just doing my job here.

837
01:18:07,207 --> 01:18:08,879
I'm...

838
01:18:09,887 --> 01:18:13,163
I'm not arguin' here.

839
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:16,842
I'm cooperating and there's no...
We're doin' all we can.

840
01:18:23,967 --> 01:18:26,401
Sir, could I talk to Mr Gustafson?

841
01:18:30,647 --> 01:18:32,524
Mr Lundegaard.

842
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:38,317
Well, heck!
If you wanna play games here...

843
01:18:38,407 --> 01:18:41,001
I'm workin' with ya
on this thing here, but...

844
01:18:41,087 --> 01:18:43,840
OK, I'll do a damn lot count.

845
01:18:43,927 --> 01:18:46,316
- Sir, right now?
- Yah, right now.

846
01:18:47,207 --> 01:18:49,402
You're darned tootin'.

847
01:18:49,487 --> 01:18:53,002
If its so damned important to ya.

848
01:18:53,087 --> 01:18:54,964
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

849
01:18:55,047 --> 01:18:57,038
Ah, what the Christ. Jesus!

850
01:19:38,847 --> 01:19:41,156
Oh, for Pete's sake.

851
01:19:45,487 --> 01:19:50,117
For Pete's sake, he's fleein' the interview.
He's fleein' the interview!

852
01:19:50,807 --> 01:19:53,116
How do I get an outside line here?

853
01:19:54,727 --> 01:19:56,524
Great.

854
01:19:58,807 --> 01:20:00,877
Yah, Detective Sibert, please.

855
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:05,282
I said it was over. I made myself clear.

856
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:10,361
Oh, you did. You made yourself
peftectly clear, but something's come up.

857
01:20:10,447 --> 01:20:13,166
- What?
- Its something kind of small,

858
01:20:13,247 --> 01:20:15,477
but it might be a big problem.

859
01:20:15,567 --> 01:20:17,717
I'm pregnant.

860
01:20:18,407 --> 01:20:20,557
I'm pregnant.

861
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:26,800
I've had a doctor's test and there's no
doubt about it. I'm gonna have your baby.

862
01:20:36,687 --> 01:20:38,678
You should see the other guy.

863
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:47,718
What the fuck happened to her?

864
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:51,367
Oh, she started shriekin', you know.

865
01:20:51,447 --> 01:20:53,278
Jesus.

866
01:20:53,367 --> 01:20:55,483
Well, I got the money.

867
01:20:55,567 --> 01:20:58,923
All of it. All 80 grand.

868
01:21:00,287 --> 01:21:03,085
Thats 40 for you. 40 for me.

869
01:21:04,927 --> 01:21:06,918
Thats it, then.

870
01:21:10,887 --> 01:21:13,640
You can have my truck.
I'm takin' the Ciera.

871
01:21:14,047 --> 01:21:16,402
We split that.

872
01:21:17,407 --> 01:21:22,242
How the fuck do you split a fuckin' car,
you dummy? With a fuckin' chain saw?

873
01:21:23,007 --> 01:21:25,475
One of us pays the other for half.

874
01:21:25,807 --> 01:21:28,765
Hold on. No fuckin' way.

875
01:21:28,847 --> 01:21:31,725
Did you fuckin' notice this?

876
01:21:31,807 --> 01:21:33,763
I got fuckin' shot!

877
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:35,997
I got fuckin' shot in the face.

878
01:21:36,087 --> 01:21:39,363
I went and got the fuckin' money.
I got shot fuckin' pickin' it up.

879
01:21:39,447 --> 01:21:42,245
I've been up for 36 fuckin' hours.

880
01:21:43,327 --> 01:21:48,162
I'm takin' that fuckin' car.
That fucker's mine, you fuckin' asshole.

881
01:21:48,247 --> 01:21:51,444
I've had to listen to
your fuckin' bullshit all week.

882
01:21:51,527 --> 01:21:53,882
Are we square?

883
01:21:54,887 --> 01:21:56,957
Are we square?

884
01:21:58,607 --> 01:22:00,882
Yeah, you fuckin' mute.

885
01:22:02,567 --> 01:22:07,402
If you see your friend Shep Proudfoot,
tell him I'm gonna nail his fuckin' ass.

886
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:25,318
His wife, this guy says,
was kidnapped last Wednesday.

887
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:27,841
- The day of our homicides.
- Yah.

888
01:22:27,927 --> 01:22:31,806
- And this guy was who?
- Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.

889
01:22:31,887 --> 01:22:34,685
- Gustafson's accountant?
- Yah.

890
01:22:34,767 --> 01:22:37,918
But we still haven't found Gustafson?

891
01:22:38,007 --> 01:22:41,317
- Sorry. Didn't copy, Lou.
- Still missing. We're looking.

892
01:22:41,407 --> 01:22:45,719
- Copy. And Lundegaard, too?
- Yah. Where are ya, Margie?

893
01:22:45,807 --> 01:22:48,685
I'm almost back.
I'm takin' a drive round Moose Lake.

894
01:22:48,767 --> 01:22:52,203
- Oh, Gary's loudmouth.
- Yah, the loudmouth.

895
01:22:52,287 --> 01:22:55,597
So the whole state has it?
Gustafson and Lundegaard.

896
01:22:55,687 --> 01:22:58,360
Yah, its over the wire. They'll find them.

897
01:22:58,447 --> 01:23:00,881
- Copy.
- Yah, we got a lead on a...

898
01:23:00,967 --> 01:23:03,435
- There's the car! There's the car!
- Whose car?

899
01:23:03,527 --> 01:23:07,156
My car! My car! Tan Ciera. Tan Ciera.

900
01:23:07,247 --> 01:23:10,239
OK. Careful, Margie.
I'll send a couple of cars.

901
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:01,118
Police!

902
01:25:07,687 --> 01:25:09,484
Hands up!

903
01:25:09,567 --> 01:25:11,558
Police!

904
01:25:14,047 --> 01:25:16,322
Police!

905
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:15,559
So that was Mrs Lundegaard
on the floor in there?

906
01:26:20,727 --> 01:26:24,242
And I guess that was your accomplice
in the wood chipper.

907
01:26:28,287 --> 01:26:31,040
And those three people in Brainerd.

908
01:26:36,007 --> 01:26:38,567
And for what?

909
01:26:38,647 --> 01:26:40,638
For a little bit of money.

910
01:26:45,647 --> 01:26:48,764
There's more to life
than a little money, you know.

911
01:26:58,087 --> 01:27:00,282
Don't you know that?

912
01:27:05,967 --> 01:27:07,844
And here y'are.

913
01:27:08,847 --> 01:27:11,236
And its a beautiful day.

914
01:27:19,607 --> 01:27:21,598
Well.

915
01:27:33,127 --> 01:27:35,118
I just don't understand it.

916
01:28:06,167 --> 01:28:10,524
Outside of Bismarck, North Dakota

917
01:28:15,807 --> 01:28:17,798
Mr Anderson?

918
01:28:18,487 --> 01:28:20,637
- Who?
- Mr Anderson.

919
01:28:20,727 --> 01:28:22,877
Is this your burgundy '98 out here?

920
01:28:24,407 --> 01:28:27,365
- Just a sec.
- Could you open the door, please?

921
01:28:27,447 --> 01:28:29,836
Yah, yah, just a sec.

922
01:28:29,927 --> 01:28:31,918
Just a sec.

923
01:28:40,407 --> 01:28:42,398
No!

924
01:29:19,407 --> 01:29:22,205
They announced it.

925
01:29:22,287 --> 01:29:25,199
- They announced it?
- Yah.

926
01:29:25,287 --> 01:29:27,198
So?

927
01:29:27,287 --> 01:29:29,517
Three-cent stamp.

928
01:29:29,607 --> 01:29:32,963
- Your mallard?
- Yah.

929
01:29:33,047 --> 01:29:35,038
Oh, thats terrific.

930
01:29:35,127 --> 01:29:38,278
- Its just the three-cent.
- Its terrific.

931
01:29:38,367 --> 01:29:41,518
Hautmans' blue-winged teal
got the 29-cent.

932
01:29:41,607 --> 01:29:43,643
People don't much use the three-cent.

933
01:29:43,727 --> 01:29:46,116
Oh, for Pete's sake, of course they do.

934
01:29:47,247 --> 01:29:51,160
Whenever they raise the postage,
people need the little stamps.

935
01:29:51,247 --> 01:29:52,282
Yah?

936
01:29:52,367 --> 01:29:55,484
When they're stuck with
a bunch of the old ones.

937
01:29:55,567 --> 01:29:58,559
Yah, I guess.

938
01:30:00,127 --> 01:30:03,119
Its terrific. I'm so proud of you, Norm.

939
01:30:06,407 --> 01:30:09,319
Heck, Norm, you know,
we're doin' pretty good.

940
01:30:12,047 --> 01:30:14,561
I love you, Margie.

941
01:30:14,647 --> 01:30:16,638
I love you, Norm.

942
01:30:19,207 --> 01:30:21,198
Two more months.

943
01:30:24,167 --> 01:30:26,158
Two more months.
