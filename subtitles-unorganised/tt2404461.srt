3
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:52,662
You still smoke?

4
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:54,677
No, it's because of getting old

5
00:01:58,591 --> 00:01:59,391
Here you are

6
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:01,175
Look at your bag...

7
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:09,754
Have you got a car?

8
00:02:10,044 --> 00:02:11,696
No, I borrowed it

9
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:16,425
What's this?

10
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:26,416
It's too cold

11
00:02:27,657 --> 00:02:28,557
Yeah

12
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,366
What's up?

13
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:38,433
My wrist hurts

14
00:02:38,496 --> 00:02:40,152
Leave it to me..

15
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:42,907
You have become old, too

16
00:02:44,796 --> 00:02:47,006
Look over there see if I can pass

17
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,950
Yeah, there is enough space

18
00:02:51,312 --> 00:02:52,832
Stop...Stop

19
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,565
What are you doing?

20
00:02:56,907 --> 00:03:02,700
The past

21
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:07,572
Do the girls know that I've arrived?

22
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,530
No

23
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:10,650
Didn't you tell them?

24
00:03:10,671 --> 00:03:14,732
I was afraid that you couldn't come
like the last time

25
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:25,369
Put it in fourth gear

26
00:03:33,872 --> 00:03:36,645
Now I'm here, you can tell them

27
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,222
I want to see them

28
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:40,196
We're going to see them

29
00:03:40,443 --> 00:03:41,843
Where?

30
00:03:42,548 --> 00:03:44,237
We'll pick up Luci from school then we get home

31
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,666
Didn't you book the hotel?

32
00:03:45,676 --> 00:03:46,776
No

33
00:03:47,723 --> 00:03:49,753
You were supposed to...

34
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,690
I wasn't sure you would come.

35
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:52,932
What't than supposed to mean?

36
00:03:53,226 --> 00:03:56,055
I Was not SURE

37
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,901
Look, last time I got so busy...

38
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:02,735
Two days before my flight...

39
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:04,129
Forget it...

40
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:06,510
If you want to explain, it takes the whole time you're here

41
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,364
Because I had to cancel my flight?

42
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:09,311
No

43
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,469
For many things

44
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:26,158
Children will be happy if you come home.

45
00:04:26,963 --> 00:04:28,687
I didn't mean any trouble for you.

46
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:30,181
You don't.

47
00:04:32,818 --> 00:04:36,027
Anyway, you had to come home to take your suitcase.

48
00:04:39,694 --> 00:04:42,775
At least you can change your clothes not to get cold.

49
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:56,165
She was going to fine you, I had to move the car.

50
00:05:56,643 --> 00:05:58,043
What happend?

51
00:05:58,056 --> 00:05:59,256
She is gone.

52
00:06:00,764 --> 00:06:03,561
Did you tell her we would pick her up?

53
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,450
Let's go.

54
00:06:19,742 --> 00:06:22,747
Maybe we're late then she has gone home.

55
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:26,535
It's not her first time.

56
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:28,479
Last time she got home at 11.

57
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:30,876
It's because of their age, It's normal.

58
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,604
No it's not normal.

59
00:06:34,505 --> 00:06:36,521
What has happened to her?

60
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,379
She has been irritating me
for silly things for two months.

61
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:48,914
Can you talk to her?

62
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:52,863
Maybe you can get what is wrong with her.

63
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:56,879
If she remembers me, after this long time.

64
00:06:59,258 --> 00:07:01,119
She loves you very much.

65
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:02,379
Yet?

66
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,704
Don't go that way...where are you going?...
This way.

67
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:17,835
Sorry

68
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,009
you forgot everything.

69
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:22,929
I got distracted.

70
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:46,431
Marie, don't put them in the car it's dangerous.

71
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:24,141
Is Luci back?

72
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:25,963
No

73
00:08:47,262 --> 00:08:49,818
Fouad, you broke it.

74
00:08:50,605 --> 00:08:51,453
Pull it firm.

75
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,309
I can't... it's cutting my hand.

76
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:55,393
No, no...Not this way.

77
00:08:55,421 --> 00:08:59,282
First, one side should be set then the othe side.

78
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:02,216
Let me show you.

79
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:03,822
This one...

80
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:07,399
We set it in this way...

81
00:09:08,652 --> 00:09:09,796
Alright

82
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:15,320
It needs some oil, do you know where it is?

83
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:19,184
We used to put it on that shelf in the store

84
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:21,455
Ahmad

85
00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:24,769
Lea, Are you ok?

86
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:28,169
You have really grown up..!

87
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:31,865
Hello Sir

88
00:09:34,843 --> 00:09:37,217
Your friend is a bit stuck-up!!

89
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:38,553
What's his name?

90
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:41,949
My name is Fouad

91
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:43,899
Hello Fouad.

92
00:09:44,612 --> 00:09:45,924
Are you alright?

93
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,530
Ahmad, Come in

94
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:28,847
Fouad, come to your room and take your things, come on

95
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,632
It was not in the store

96
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:39,020
So, it must have been moved when I was not here.

97
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:43,463
My father has some in his car.

98
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:47,120
What happend to bookcase that was there?

99
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:48,841
The old one, it was wooden.

100
00:10:48,906 --> 00:10:49,818
We threw it out.

101
00:10:49,888 --> 00:10:52,901
Really? some of my books were in that bookcase.

102
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,790
We gathered all of your stuff and put them in the store.

103
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:58,373
Fouad, take your your stuff.

104
00:10:58,451 --> 00:10:59,648
I don't like to sleep upstairs.

105
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:00,582
What?

106
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:01,683
I do not like to sleep up.

107
00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:03,613
Do what I said.

108
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:09,472
Be careful not to be painted.

109
00:11:13,068 --> 00:11:15,292
Wasn't the last colour better?

110
00:11:15,387 --> 00:11:20,865
It isn't done yet, my wrist didn't keep up
I couldn't finish it up

111
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:30,100
You should have waited for me
I would have painted it myself.

112
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:33,133
It would've kept me busy here.

113
00:11:33,854 --> 00:11:36,951
You were going to go to hotel.

114
00:11:39,771 --> 00:11:42,283
Give it to me.

115
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:56,881
Ouch..! keep it back
I got burned.

116
00:11:56,948 --> 00:11:58,148
Sorry

117
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,788
That's enough, thank you.

118
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:01,009
It's ok.

119
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,016
I put the car keys here.

120
00:12:13,087 --> 00:12:14,287
Thanks.

121
00:12:14,974 --> 00:12:19,463
I put you some clothes upstairs
change them not to get cold.

122
00:12:28,676 --> 00:12:31,270
What are you doing here?

123
00:12:34,312 --> 00:12:37,677
Come on... you sleep up
and Luci sleeps down.

124
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:50,836
Luci, call me pleaase, I have got a good news for you.

125
00:12:55,014 --> 00:12:58,087
Just till Ahmad is here.

126
00:12:59,382 --> 00:13:01,275
Go please...

127
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,347
She drives me crazy.

128
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,527
Is that your father's car in front of the door?

129
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:00,183
Yes

130
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,293
Do you live here?

131
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,259
Yes

132
00:14:06,331 --> 00:14:08,292
With your father?

133
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,880
Yes

134
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,620
How long?

135
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:20,929
Since the school began.

136
00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:29,823
You don't need to make this bed,
come down go to your own bed.

137
00:14:37,036 --> 00:14:39,817
Go up... Get down.

138
00:14:39,857 --> 00:14:40,757
What?

139
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,850
One says go up, one says get down.

140
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:51,098
I'm sorry.

141
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,832
Why did you come down?

142
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,879
He told me.

143
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:03,105
Ask himself
such beard he has.

144
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,114
There isn't enough bed for three of them down there.

145
00:15:15,037 --> 00:15:19,202
Do you live with someone here?

146
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:22,378
Yeah

147
00:15:27,798 --> 00:15:29,346
You didn't tell me.

148
00:15:29,435 --> 00:15:30,635
I didn'tell you?

149
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:32,477
I wrote you in one of my E-mails.

150
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:33,537
What E-mail?

151
00:15:33,556 --> 00:15:37,241
I can't remember, I told you in one of them.

152
00:15:37,266 --> 00:15:40,235
I didn't recieve such an E-mail.

153
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:43,180
So, why did you want to go to hotel?

154
00:15:43,215 --> 00:15:46,376
I didn't want to make you uncomfortable.

155
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,325
Anyway, I had told you.

156
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:52,164
But  I didn't recieve such an E-mail.

157
00:16:00,678 --> 00:16:06,451
So what did you think I told you come to court to get divorced for?

158
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,358
Does he know that I'm here?

159
00:16:14,536 --> 00:16:16,736
Yes

160
00:16:25,992 --> 00:16:28,372
So I leave.

161
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:31,785
He doesn't come till you are here.

162
00:16:31,803 --> 00:16:35,348
If he does, he will let us know.

163
00:16:37,783 --> 00:16:41,016
When did you send me that e-mail?

164
00:16:42,062 --> 00:16:43,707
I don't know.

165
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,249
So it must be in your E-mails now, yeah?

166
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,141
Yes, I suppose.

167
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:52,217
Do you want me to show you?

168
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,369
You were supposed to book me a hotel.

169
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:58,734
Last time I did, But you didn't come.
I had to cancel it.

170
00:16:58,808 --> 00:17:02,217
How much did you pay for canceling?

171
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:06,884
When should I be in the court tomorrow?

172
00:17:07,745 --> 00:17:11,158
You said you would talk to Luci.

173
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:13,580
When does she come?

174
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,835
I don't know.

175
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:18,751
I'll see her tomorrow.

176
00:17:22,322 --> 00:17:26,495
I hoped you would keep your promise
just for once in your life.

177
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,337
I didn't make you any promise.

178
00:17:30,408 --> 00:17:33,677
Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry.

179
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,831
Fouad, Is it hard for you to look where you step on?

180
00:17:46,424 --> 00:17:50,325
Why do I clean here?

181
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,691
that you make it dirty!!

182
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,519
Look at me.

183
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:55,840
We went to bring this.

184
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:57,436
I don't care what you went to bring.

185
00:17:57,441 --> 00:17:58,865
Fouad, Get back here.

186
00:17:58,887 --> 00:18:00,848
I told you get back here.

187
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:02,981
Told you come here.

188
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:06,405
Leave me alone.

189
00:18:06,456 --> 00:18:07,256
Leave me.

190
00:18:07,282 --> 00:18:08,562
Stop it.

191
00:18:09,446 --> 00:18:11,034
Fouad, Come here.

192
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:13,431
Leave me.

193
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:15,432
Come down, I'm tired of you.

194
00:18:16,783 --> 00:18:18,183
Leave me alone.

195
00:18:18,772 --> 00:18:19,952
Stop it.

196
00:18:23,246 --> 00:18:24,762
Stop it Foaud.

197
00:18:24,768 --> 00:18:25,968
Leave me.

198
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:27,101
Leave me.

199
00:18:28,177 --> 00:18:29,882
Look what you've done here.

200
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:31,421
Stop it.

201
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:35,060
Go...Get in.

202
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:38,635
I told you leave me...leave me.

203
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,755
Please...sorry...sorry

204
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:45,220
Let go of me, I want to go my own home.

205
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,360
Sorry

206
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,388
Get out.

207
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:51,975
You drive me crazy, Fouad

208
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,493
Put an end to this Fouad.

209
00:18:53,585 --> 00:18:54,785
I want to go to our own home.

210
00:18:54,877 --> 00:18:57,110
You stay here Fouad.

211
00:19:01,476 --> 00:19:02,776
Open it.

212
00:19:03,718 --> 00:19:04,918
Open the door.

213
00:19:09,112 --> 00:19:11,177
I want to go to our own home.

214
00:19:12,293 --> 00:19:13,981
You should go, you're running late.

215
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:14,969
I'm cleaning

216
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:15,906
I'll do it

217
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:16,831
No, I'll do it myself

218
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,468
Don't do that with your injured wrist.

219
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,753
Give it to me

220
00:19:23,197 --> 00:19:25,058
You wanted to go?

221
00:19:25,826 --> 00:19:30,075
I'll wait for Luci to come

222
00:19:30,565 --> 00:19:32,765
You should go

223
00:19:35,404 --> 00:19:42,030
Lea, give me my shoes please, come on

224
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:09,754
Do you keep an eye on them?

225
00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:11,865
Yes, you can go

226
00:20:15,908 --> 00:20:16,908
Thank you

227
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,373
Open the door...

228
00:20:25,855 --> 00:20:27,343
Open it...

229
00:20:31,144 --> 00:20:32,144


230
00:20:32,225 --> 00:20:36,173
Foaud, come down

231
00:20:36,904 --> 00:20:40,649
Stay back, I want to open the door

232
00:20:43,235 --> 00:20:45,347
What?

233
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,645
hmm?

234
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,654
Where are you going?

235
00:20:54,973 --> 00:20:55,774
Stop

236
00:20:55,858 --> 00:20:56,558
Leave me

237
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:57,333
Stop

238
00:20:57,415 --> 00:20:58,115
Leave me

239
00:20:58,198 --> 00:20:59,127
Ok, come down

240
00:20:59,128 --> 00:21:00,044
Let go of my hands

241
00:21:00,057 --> 00:21:04,482
Come down Fouad, first tell me where you wanna go

242
00:21:05,028 --> 00:21:06,852
Take it easy Fouad

243
00:21:07,086 --> 00:21:08,070
What are you doing?

244
00:21:10,048 --> 00:21:11,364
I want to go

245
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,078
Where?

246
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:14,073
Our home

247
00:21:14,164 --> 00:21:15,684
Where is it?

248
00:21:15,726 --> 00:21:17,527
Paris, it's too far
he can't go there

249
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:19,649
Shut up, no one asked you anything

250
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,764
Don't talk like that here..
Got it?

251
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:30,090
You go, I want to talk to Fouad

252
00:21:37,301 --> 00:21:39,217
What's up Fouad?

253
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:48,970
What has happened?

254
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,420
I want to go to our own home

255
00:21:52,608 --> 00:21:55,545
Do you want make a call there?

256
00:21:59,704 --> 00:22:02,197
No one is there

257
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:16,705
What is bothering you here?

258
00:22:17,932 --> 00:22:21,065
Becuase she had a fight with you? yeah?

259
00:22:24,571 --> 00:22:27,676
You were not a good kid either

260
00:22:27,689 --> 00:22:32,126
You splashed the paints over the floor

261
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,023
Didn't you?

262
00:22:38,094 --> 00:22:39,987
That's not because of the paints

263
00:22:40,507 --> 00:22:43,431
So why?

264
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,743
Because I'm here? yeah?

265
00:22:50,374 --> 00:22:52,794
Do you want me to leave?

266
00:23:13,496 --> 00:23:14,208
Hello Madam

267
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:15,392
Hello

268
00:23:19,056 --> 00:23:20,356
You ok?

269
00:23:22,714 --> 00:23:23,858
Not bad

270
00:23:23,868 --> 00:23:26,424
His flight had a delay

271
00:23:27,856 --> 00:23:28,956
Has he arrived?

272
00:23:29,152 --> 00:23:30,452
Yeah

273
00:23:40,407 --> 00:23:41,807
Here you are

274
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:44,358
Where did you park it?

275
00:23:44,402 --> 00:23:45,702
Over there

276
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,830
Where?

277
00:23:46,832 --> 00:23:48,032
There

278
00:23:48,764 --> 00:23:52,446
Don't put them in the car, it's dangerous

279
00:23:53,739 --> 00:23:55,268
Did you go to the hospital today?

280
00:23:55,326 --> 00:23:56,426
yes

281
00:23:57,154 --> 00:23:58,347
So how is she?

282
00:23:58,423 --> 00:23:59,735
As usual

283
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,548
Didn't you bring Fouad?

284
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:09,211
What for?

285
00:24:09,219 --> 00:24:11,916
He called me to pick him up

286
00:24:12,052 --> 00:24:14,717
He said he doesn't want to be ther any more

287
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:19,483
I had a fight with him, with both of them

288
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:28,276
I'll pick him up tonight,
I take him to my place tonight

289
00:24:28,287 --> 00:24:29,924
Why are you so tough about it?

290
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:31,328
It's the first time that he says so

291
00:24:31,354 --> 00:24:33,555
Because it's the first time I had an argument with him

292
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:36,120
I promised him

293
00:24:36,302 --> 00:24:37,540
Ok, I shouldn't have got angry

294
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:40,182
I make it up to him tonight

295
00:25:01,854 --> 00:25:04,863
If you wanna come, let me know before

296
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:51,800
Such a great popcorn (speaking persian)

297
00:25:55,207 --> 00:25:58,332
Fouad, Don't do that

298
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:05,301
Take it to him...be careful

299
00:26:09,412 --> 00:26:10,612
Take it

300
00:26:12,128 --> 00:26:13,172
I don't want it

301
00:26:13,194 --> 00:26:14,142
You cut your hand

302
00:26:14,216 --> 00:26:15,545
No I didn't, it has been before

303
00:26:15,571 --> 00:26:17,555
It's bleeding

304
00:26:17,652 --> 00:26:20,676
Ahmad, he cut himself

305
00:26:37,991 --> 00:26:39,991
Luci

306
00:26:59,931 --> 00:27:01,431
Ahmad?

307
00:27:05,993 --> 00:27:08,349
How did you get it's me?

308
00:27:08,721 --> 00:27:10,082
I knew you would come today

309
00:27:10,181 --> 00:27:11,865
Little Luci

310
00:27:13,433 --> 00:27:14,426
What do you eat Luci?

311
00:27:14,524 --> 00:27:15,573
I don't, Tanks

312
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,732
Come on..please

313
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:25,751
You won't find such A great Qorme Sabzi (Persian Food) anywhere else
Unless you marry two cool iranian men

314
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:30,312
You should marry a persian woman too

315
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,801
How is it?

316
00:27:36,229 --> 00:27:37,345
You want more?

317
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,810
No

318
00:27:39,776 --> 00:27:42,769
What does a persian woman look like?

319
00:27:42,978 --> 00:27:48,099
A persian woman...like me but a womanly type

320
00:27:48,163 --> 00:27:53,079
See...like this

321
00:27:55,518 --> 00:27:56,698
Did you like that?

322
00:27:56,747 --> 00:27:59,800
Always like this...does she have a beard?

323
00:28:02,362 --> 00:28:05,203
Do you like to go to Iran with Ahmad?

324
00:28:05,645 --> 00:28:07,265
How are they?

325
00:28:08,442 --> 00:28:10,279
Do you always get home late?

326
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,005
Just for sleep

327
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:13,706
Really?

328
00:28:13,748 --> 00:28:16,257
Because I have no other place to sleep in

329
00:28:16,307 --> 00:28:19,585
Why don't you want to stay here?

330
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,304
Like yourself...

331
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:26,270
So you move to your friend's home tomorrow

332
00:28:26,286 --> 00:28:28,815
This is not my home

333
00:28:29,837 --> 00:28:33,074
But your frind's home is?

334
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:36,148
I'm not comfortable here

335
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:38,892
Neither am I

336
00:28:39,647 --> 00:28:41,303
Your case is different

337
00:28:41,571 --> 00:28:48,049
It's hard for me to see someone everyday
who wants to marry my ex-wife

338
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:51,554
She is just your ex-wife now?

339
00:28:51,554 --> 00:28:52,954
yeah

340
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:56,593
It's ridiculous

341
00:28:56,604 --> 00:28:57,604
What?

342
00:28:57,683 --> 00:29:00,924
You lived with her for several years
Now she is just your ex-wife

343
00:29:00,988 --> 00:29:03,349
Now everything is different

344
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,464
We seprated

345
00:29:05,516 --> 00:29:07,281
Give me a hand

346
00:29:13,736 --> 00:29:16,297
I think you're old enough to understand

347
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,279
Old enough not to be advised by everyone

348
00:29:18,569 --> 00:29:21,738
I didn't come here to advise you

349
00:29:24,448 --> 00:29:28,705
Your mother asked me to have a word with you
to see what's wrong with you

350
00:29:28,786 --> 00:29:31,624
I don't know why she thinks you're more comfortable with me than her

351
00:29:31,694 --> 00:29:34,491
She knows what I'm angry about

352
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:38,836
I don't want to be here when that bastard comes

353
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:44,509
Luci

354
00:29:48,678 --> 00:29:51,743
Come, take sit here for a moment

355
00:30:03,392 --> 00:30:05,744
Isn't he a good man?

356
00:30:09,754 --> 00:30:11,583
I don't know...I barely know him

357
00:30:11,613 --> 00:30:14,406
So why do you call him a "bastard"?

358
00:30:14,463 --> 00:30:16,583
What has he done?

359
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,821
Nothing

360
00:30:21,963 --> 00:30:24,532
He has nothing to do here

361
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,137
Look, your mother is going to marry him

362
00:30:27,224 --> 00:30:29,565
She has the right to marry everyone she wants

363
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:30,978
Everyone?

364
00:30:31,726 --> 00:30:36,119
Even someone who has a child and his wife is in coma

365
00:30:36,302 --> 00:30:38,854
Fouad's mother?

366
00:30:43,585 --> 00:30:48,495
What if she was going to marry someone else?
Was it ok with you?

367
00:30:48,511 --> 00:30:50,727
It makes no difference

368
00:30:50,764 --> 00:30:54,029
So that guy is not your problem?

369
00:30:55,495 --> 00:31:00,389
She has married three men since I was born

370
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,324
We had always this issue

371
00:31:07,858 --> 00:31:14,303
This one also stays a couple of years and then will leave us

372
00:31:21,154 --> 00:31:23,123
Can you talk to her?

373
00:31:23,178 --> 00:31:25,578
What should I say to her?

374
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,437
Talk her out of it

375
00:31:47,518 --> 00:31:50,055
Kids, are you still awake?

376
00:31:50,064 --> 00:31:51,933
Fouad, get up and go to sleep

377
00:31:51,983 --> 00:31:53,616
Just two mintues more...please

378
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:56,149
Just two minutes

379
00:31:57,811 --> 00:31:59,111
Hi

380
00:32:03,692 --> 00:32:05,400
Goog night (In Persian)

381
00:32:06,172 --> 00:32:07,672
Luci

382
00:32:07,695 --> 00:32:09,860
Would you sleep downstairs tonight?

383
00:32:09,918 --> 00:32:12,223
Fouad and Ahmad go up

384
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:19,064
I made dinner, if you didn't have

385
00:32:20,216 --> 00:32:21,916
Thanks

386
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,987
Do you want me to warm it up?

387
00:32:24,014 --> 00:32:25,314
No thanks

388
00:32:26,702 --> 00:32:29,626
Where did you get vegetables?

389
00:32:30,132 --> 00:32:33,694
I went shopping with kids

390
00:32:35,498 --> 00:32:37,986
You're still a good cook

391
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:41,552
Just a good cook...nothing more

392
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:48,169
What time should we be there tomorrow?

393
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,285
You don't eat Qorme Sabzi with fork
Did you forget it?

394
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,394
Take this

395
00:33:14,777 --> 00:33:16,665
Did you talk to her?

396
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:17,951
Yes

397
00:33:19,658 --> 00:33:20,958
So what?

398
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:22,983
As you guess

399
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:28,719
She doesn't like you marring again

400
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:41,469
She is afraid that he leaves you after a while

401
00:33:42,595 --> 00:33:46,428
Make her sure that he doesn't

402
00:33:48,002 --> 00:33:51,492
I think I'm not the right person to make her understand

403
00:33:51,994 --> 00:33:56,027
That she should be happy about your marriage

404
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:59,655
I didn't say she should be happy

405
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:03,178
I just wanted to know what's her problem
What she want

406
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:06,733
She wants you don't marry

407
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:11,736
Yes, I laughed too

408
00:34:13,124 --> 00:34:18,249
Try to convince her before you make youe decision

409
00:34:19,573 --> 00:34:23,534
I've already made my decision

410
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:42,175
Fouad

411
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,440
Yes

412
00:34:44,038 --> 00:34:47,667
If you aren't comfortable, we can change our bed

413
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,384
No, I'm ok

414
00:34:55,522 --> 00:34:56,866
I need to pee

415
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,548
Ok, get up...

416
00:35:02,273 --> 00:35:03,685
Come on

417
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:02,789
Did you talk to her doctor?

418
00:36:03,049 --> 00:36:07,137
No, just her nurse

419
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:10,996
What did she say?

420
00:36:11,223 --> 00:36:16,884
What do you mean?
The scratches on her stomache

421
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:23,428
She said she did that to herself after I paied her a visit again

422
00:36:24,299 --> 00:36:27,344
Maybe it has nothing to do with you visiting her

423
00:36:27,411 --> 00:36:29,385
Maybe it was unintentional

424
00:36:29,423 --> 00:36:31,492
Do you like it to be unintentional?

425
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,090
I'm sorry

426
00:36:48,687 --> 00:36:50,716
You know waht you're saying?

427
00:36:50,716 --> 00:36:55,985
You can't say whatever you want and then make an apology

428
00:37:00,547 --> 00:37:03,267
Why are you here?

429
00:37:05,549 --> 00:37:08,850
It's dark, I fear to go up

430
00:37:08,922 --> 00:37:10,778
Why do you want to go up?

431
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:15,380
I told him to go up with Ahmad
The girls sleep downstairs

432
00:37:15,471 --> 00:37:20,152
Maybe he doesn't feel comfortable to sleep next to a stranger

433
00:37:21,518 --> 00:37:23,119
Go, get dressed

434
00:37:23,179 --> 00:37:26,631
I want to go to bed, I feel sleepy

435
00:37:26,818 --> 00:37:28,987
Didn't you tell me to pick you up?

436
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,754
I want to saty here

437
00:37:32,587 --> 00:37:34,284
Get in, sleep next to me

438
00:37:46,343 --> 00:37:48,681
Ahmad, It's running late

439
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,478
It's clogged

440
00:37:50,558 --> 00:37:53,475
Put it for later, we must be there at 9

441
00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:57,413
Kids, shake a leg

442
00:38:07,094 --> 00:38:08,510
Is it delicious?

443
00:38:16,332 --> 00:38:17,832
How are you?

444
00:38:18,594 --> 00:38:19,142
Hello kids

445
00:38:19,154 --> 00:38:20,254
Hi

446
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,133
Hi

447
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,780
Hi

448
00:38:23,236 --> 00:38:24,636
Samir

449
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:28,468
Sorry, my hands are dirty

450
00:38:28,938 --> 00:38:30,558
It's blocked again?

451
00:38:30,705 --> 00:38:37,655
No, I fixed it, I just need to fasten it

452
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:52,597
Would you please give me the tea?

453
00:38:58,139 --> 00:38:59,432
Get ready, we give you a ride

454
00:38:59,435 --> 00:39:02,547
I go myself

455
00:39:03,531 --> 00:39:05,460
Ahmad, we're running late

456
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,653
It's done

457
00:39:08,124 --> 00:39:10,705
Come on kids, get ready

458
00:39:12,515 --> 00:39:14,267
It's still dripping

459
00:39:14,304 --> 00:39:16,605
It was dripping before

460
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,273
I had told you that it needs a washer

461
00:39:21,422 --> 00:39:23,552
Let me fix it

462
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:29,084
Please go over there

463
00:39:40,824 --> 00:39:42,112
Have you had your breakfast?

464
00:39:42,116 --> 00:39:43,628
Not yet

465
00:39:47,766 --> 00:39:49,422
Can I see you somewhere?

466
00:39:49,424 --> 00:39:50,308
Don't you go to school?

467
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:51,022
Ahmad

468
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,399
I'm coming

469
00:39:54,749 --> 00:39:56,314
I can skip the school today

470
00:39:56,322 --> 00:39:57,851
When are you off?

471
00:39:57,941 --> 00:39:59,141
At one

472
00:40:19,286 --> 00:40:20,679
Are you looking for something?

473
00:40:20,723 --> 00:40:21,823
No

474
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,030
Wait

475
00:40:57,812 --> 00:40:59,473
I'm attacking...

476
00:41:00,514 --> 00:41:02,175
Isn't the school Luci used to go?

477
00:41:02,215 --> 00:41:03,727
Yeah, it is

478
00:41:08,038 --> 00:41:09,386
Get off

479
00:41:10,597 --> 00:41:11,649
Goodbye kids

480
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:12,886
Goodbye

481
00:41:12,914 --> 00:41:14,498
Bye mom

482
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,297
Bye dear

483
00:41:17,848 --> 00:41:19,232
Bye mom

484
00:41:19,237 --> 00:41:20,853
Hold on

485
00:41:24,925 --> 00:41:26,641
You can go, bye

486
00:41:28,584 --> 00:41:31,145
Where did you meet each other?

487
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:33,281
In pharmacy

488
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:36,709
He used to come and get medicine for his wife

489
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,543
What was wrong with his wife?

490
00:41:39,566 --> 00:41:42,582
She had depression

491
00:41:43,789 --> 00:41:45,089
What's up?

492
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:46,372
What?

493
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:48,765
Hmm....What does that mean?

494
00:41:48,815 --> 00:41:50,244
In our culture it means laugh

495
00:41:50,265 --> 00:41:52,565
But here it means mocking

496
00:41:52,622 --> 00:41:53,342
Was it funny?

497
00:41:53,346 --> 00:41:55,043
Have you missed fighting?

498
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:57,611
Here it means making fun of...was it funny
Is her depression funny?

499
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:02,500
If you get on my nerve, I'll stop here and go to Tehran right away

500
00:42:02,536 --> 00:42:07,525
- I dont divorce you and your plans will be cancelled
- You haven't changed a bit

501
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:09,076
Should I pull over?

502
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:10,167
We're late

503
00:42:10,242 --> 00:42:11,854
Should I stop?

504
00:42:15,456 --> 00:42:20,301
Now...What do you really think about him?

505
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:25,627
You first tell me how serious it is...the I'll tell you

506
00:42:27,227 --> 00:42:33,436
If it wasn't serious, I wouldn't get pregnant

507
00:42:35,508 --> 00:42:38,932
Miss, come please

508
00:42:42,131 --> 00:42:43,711
Were you kiding?

509
00:42:43,734 --> 00:42:45,734
No

510
00:42:50,021 --> 00:42:53,967


511
00:42:54,025 --> 00:42:57,974
The terms of both side would be considered

512
00:42:57,999 --> 00:43:01,735
Ms. Brisson you no longer use your husband's name

513
00:43:01,785 --> 00:43:06,162
And you're called with your own last name

514
00:43:06,202 --> 00:43:10,703
It needs to be mentioned that Ms.Brisson keeps her house

515
00:43:10,784 --> 00:43:11,484


516
00:43:11,527 --> 00:43:15,481
Your divorce will be registered on Oct 19, 2012 which means today

517
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,656
Both sides keep their own possessions...

518
00:43:17,697 --> 00:43:18,997
Sorry

519
00:43:25,754 --> 00:43:27,787
Turn it off please!

520
00:43:31,211 --> 00:43:36,039
Both sides keep their own possessions and common properties
will be divided by your own agreement

521
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:39,914
you both should pay the tax
and the cost of divorce is divided between you two

522
00:43:39,952 --> 00:43:44,173
This document explains the agreements of your divorce

523
00:43:44,196 --> 00:43:49,578
If you approve what I read, let the divorce proceed

524
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,566
Are you sure about this madam?

525
00:43:53,619 --> 00:43:55,319
Yes

526
00:43:55,799 --> 00:44:00,979
What about you sir?

527
00:44:01,078 --> 00:44:02,478
Yes

528
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:15,367
Your divorce will be registered here today
and I attach the terms I read to finish off everything

529
00:44:15,479 --> 00:44:17,244
Please turn it off

530
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:28,194
Marie, It's me. They brought the suitcase from the airport
but it's handle is broken, I don't know if somethong is missed

531
00:44:29,622 --> 00:44:31,922
Take it...what else can I do?!!

532
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,723
Give me a call

533
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:35,619
Ok?

534
00:44:35,845 --> 00:44:37,054
What if something is missed?

535
00:44:37,147 --> 00:44:38,828
Does it have insurance?

536
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:40,419
I don't know.

537
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:47,455
What should I do? Do you get it or should I take it back to airport?

538
00:44:51,012 --> 00:44:53,873
Please sign here

539
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,622
You ok? youre yes?

540
00:45:01,954 --> 00:45:03,947
I'm allergic to paints

541
00:45:04,437 --> 00:45:06,466
So you should find another job

542
00:45:12,677 --> 00:45:13,877
Luci

543
00:45:19,102 --> 00:45:21,102
How are you?

544
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:49,600
Sorry Sir!  Where can I get the bus to Tajrish?!! (In Persian)

545
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,800
How are you?

546
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,400
What the hell are you doing here?!!

547
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,400
When did you get here?

548
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,600
Yesterday

549
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Do you know her?

550
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,600
She is really grown up.

551
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,100
How are you?

552
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,200
Have you had lunch?

553
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,500
So what do you think I came here for?

554
00:46:12,496 --> 00:46:15,309
Such a beautiful lady! you remember how litte you were!

555
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,608
He used to bring you here with his bicycle

556
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,308
Shahryar...hat was her sister, she's Luci

557
00:46:20,896 --> 00:46:22,376
Really...Excuse me

558
00:46:22,408 --> 00:46:24,908
You always used to confuse them

559
00:46:24,976 --> 00:46:25,976
Go and take a sit

560
00:46:25,976 --> 00:46:26,976
Where is Valeria?

561
00:46:26,976 --> 00:46:27,976
I call her

562
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:30,514
Valeria, your friend is here

563
00:46:30,609 --> 00:46:32,609
Who?

564
00:46:33,686 --> 00:46:36,530
Ahmad?...Ahmad !

565
00:46:38,476 --> 00:46:40,612
Hello dear Valeria, How are you?

566
00:46:40,612 --> 00:46:42,494
- Hello...How are you?
- ...You ok?

567
00:46:42,494 --> 00:46:44,494
- I'm alright
- I missed you a lot

568
00:46:46,907 --> 00:46:47,963
Oh...little Luci

569
00:46:47,994 --> 00:46:49,418
Not that much little

570
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:51,831
How beautiful you are!

571
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,856
Are you two still together?

572
00:46:54,237 --> 00:46:57,756
There's still something in common between us in order to not get seprated

573
00:46:59,056 --> 00:47:00,056
The color of our flags

574
00:47:00,084 --> 00:47:01,132
What are you saying again?

575
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,075
What is your husban saying?

576
00:47:02,171 --> 00:47:04,391
He talks a lot

577
00:47:04,524 --> 00:47:06,040
How is your mom?

578
00:47:06,046 --> 00:47:07,346
She is ok

579
00:47:10,852 --> 00:47:12,768
Did you go ot court?

580
00:47:12,971 --> 00:47:14,071
Yeah

581
00:47:14,628 --> 00:47:16,676
Is it done?

582
00:47:16,724 --> 00:47:18,240
It was done long time ago

583
00:47:18,345 --> 00:47:21,655
Do you still like Ravioli (Italian food)?

584
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,557
What?

585
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:33,772
I think this guy is not that much bad that you hate him.

586
00:47:33,814 --> 00:47:37,843
Also he isn't in a good situation,

587
00:47:38,024 --> 00:47:42,665
Put yourself in his place
His wife, his kid

588
00:47:42,822 --> 00:47:47,147
How is she going to marry someone who has a wife?

589
00:47:48,077 --> 00:47:50,438
You said his wife is in coma

590
00:47:50,456 --> 00:47:52,680
Not dead yet

591
00:47:52,775 --> 00:47:54,795
Maybe she never dies

592
00:47:54,854 --> 00:47:56,878
well, this is their own problem

593
00:48:00,786 --> 00:48:03,887
You know why his wife is in coma?

594
00:48:03,911 --> 00:48:05,111
No

595
00:48:05,759 --> 00:48:07,607
How should I know?

596
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:09,921
Didn't mom tell you?

597
00:48:11,186 --> 00:48:12,486
No

598
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:17,957
She commited a suicide

599
00:48:20,706 --> 00:48:23,554
Because of depression?

600
00:48:28,115 --> 00:48:31,263
Luci, What's wrong?

601
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:37,754
Luci

602
00:48:40,609 --> 00:48:42,357
Look at me

603
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:47,223
Let's get some fresh air

604
00:48:49,422 --> 00:48:50,023
What happened?

605
00:48:51,123 --> 00:48:53,123
We want to get some fresh air

606
00:48:58,323 --> 00:49:01,523
Ahmad...Take her back room there

607
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,729
You know why she doesn't tell anyone that his wife has commited a suicide?

608
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:23,370
Come down then we talk

609
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:26,579
Because she doesn't want anyone to know

610
00:49:26,879 --> 00:49:28,279
What?

611
00:49:29,303 --> 00:49:33,252
That she attempted suicide because of their relationship

612
00:49:37,805 --> 00:49:41,774
You shouldn't talk about it with such certainty

613
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:44,366
Especially at your age

614
00:49:46,193 --> 00:49:51,294
That woman told me I grew up, but you think I didn't

615
00:49:51,854 --> 00:49:53,254
Sorry

616
00:49:57,030 --> 00:50:01,415
Ahmad, I don't want them to be together

617
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:04,343
You think it's in my hands or yours

618
00:50:04,354 --> 00:50:06,327
I can do nothing

619
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:12,544
If they get married, I never get back to that home

620
00:50:16,933 --> 00:50:21,557
Your mother is pregnant with his baby

621
00:50:25,567 --> 00:50:27,147
That's not right!!

622
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:31,950
Hold on

623
00:50:34,439 --> 00:50:35,427
Hold on I told you

624
00:50:35,493 --> 00:50:38,578
You know why she went to went to that filthy man?

625
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:41,288
Because he was like you

626
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,449
Get the keys out of my pocket

627
00:50:55,317 --> 00:50:56,617
The other side

628
00:52:11,164 --> 00:52:12,464
Hi

629
00:52:12,503 --> 00:52:14,383
You're all wet

630
00:52:14,409 --> 00:52:15,609
Yeah

631
00:52:18,253 --> 00:52:20,109
It suddenly got heavy

632
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,557
You want some coffee

633
00:52:25,618 --> 00:52:27,523
No, I just came to take my suitcase

634
00:52:27,595 --> 00:52:29,247
I have to get back

635
00:52:29,543 --> 00:52:31,299
Look, It's over there

636
00:52:32,213 --> 00:52:33,918
Wait the rain stop

637
00:52:33,974 --> 00:52:36,651
I don't suppose it stop soon

638
00:52:38,677 --> 00:52:39,729
Is Luci back?

639
00:52:39,733 --> 00:52:41,617
No, watch out not to be painted

640
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,533
It's handle was broken when they delivered it

641
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:53,583
Have you called her friends?

642
00:52:53,649 --> 00:52:57,958
No, I can't call them anymore

643
00:53:01,007 --> 00:53:02,668
Did you talk to her today?

644
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:04,023
Yes

645
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:07,517
Have got some sort of rope to tie it up with?

646
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:11,169
There're some in a suitcase in the store

647
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,280
You can take them.

648
00:53:16,265 --> 00:53:17,985
Are the kids asleep?

649
00:53:18,688 --> 00:53:19,789
No

650
00:54:16,658 --> 00:54:19,642
Would you turn it on?

651
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,813
Would you call the kids to give them their souvenirs

652
00:54:35,827 --> 00:54:36,847
What about Fouad?

653
00:54:36,862 --> 00:54:37,606
Yes, sure

654
00:54:37,646 --> 00:54:39,712
You didn't have any plan for him

655
00:54:39,746 --> 00:54:42,759
I've found somethig for him now

656
00:54:43,273 --> 00:54:45,470
May I ask you don't do that

657
00:54:46,572 --> 00:54:47,772
Why?

658
00:54:48,537 --> 00:54:52,850
He has done something bad that should be punished for

659
00:54:52,909 --> 00:54:55,835
Both of them are responsible for that,
And both of them should be punished

660
00:54:55,885 --> 00:54:57,994
I speak on behalf of my own child

661
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:01,607
What has he done?

662
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:05,426
Without permission they took the present out of your suitcase

663
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:08,237
But the present is here now

664
00:55:08,301 --> 00:55:09,895
I put it back

665
00:55:09,957 --> 00:55:12,162
I don't want him to think that the problem is solved

666
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:15,079
The suitcase was open, they got temptated

667
00:55:15,162 --> 00:55:17,167
I ask them to make an apology

668
00:55:17,175 --> 00:55:20,716
This way they learn to get away by making an apology

669
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:26,348
I told them that I brought them some gifts
I can't ignore that

670
00:55:27,252 --> 00:55:29,304
Would you stop it?

671
00:55:29,308 --> 00:55:31,849
I punished them enough today

672
00:55:31,989 --> 00:55:34,558
I just said if that's possible

673
00:56:38,198 --> 00:56:39,398
Hello

674
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:41,047
Hi kids

675
00:56:41,811 --> 00:56:45,005
No..no, at first they should make an apology
Both of them

676
00:56:48,526 --> 00:56:49,826
I'm sorry

677
00:56:53,537 --> 00:56:54,837
YOU?

678
00:56:55,248 --> 00:56:56,781
I didn't take anything

679
00:56:56,835 --> 00:57:00,373
But you were there, weren't you?

680
00:57:01,094 --> 00:57:02,014
But I didn't take anything

681
00:57:02,031 --> 00:57:03,624
It's not important who did

682
00:57:03,672 --> 00:57:06,869
You both were there, you should've told her not to do that

683
00:57:10,643 --> 00:57:11,891
Say you are sorry

684
00:57:24,368 --> 00:57:25,616
Apologize

685
00:57:28,842 --> 00:57:30,226
I apologize

686
00:57:33,057 --> 00:57:34,718
Say I'm sorry

687
00:57:34,797 --> 00:57:36,581
I'm sorry

688
00:57:37,249 --> 00:57:38,801
Look at him

689
00:57:39,238 --> 00:57:40,322
Apologize

690
00:57:40,505 --> 00:57:41,989
I'm sorry

691
00:57:53,104 --> 00:57:56,881
Ok, Come and take your presents

692
00:57:58,711 --> 00:58:00,491
Come on

693
00:58:01,051 --> 00:58:04,137
You spoke in a way as if I took it

694
00:58:04,501 --> 00:58:06,006
I just said I took nothing

695
00:58:06,032 --> 00:58:07,316
So I did it

696
00:58:07,356 --> 00:58:08,808
Yes You took it

697
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:10,081
No

698
00:58:10,118 --> 00:58:13,587
You told me that the suitcase is open

699
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,761
You didn't have to listen to me

700
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,845
I know why you're upset

701
00:58:18,908 --> 00:58:22,082
Because he gave a helicopter but gave you coloured pencils

702
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,420
Shut up

703
00:58:25,883 --> 00:58:26,683
Crazy

704
00:58:26,688 --> 00:58:27,288
Shut up

705
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,088
You crazy sick

706
00:58:34,917 --> 00:58:37,455
I took your size four years ago

707
00:58:39,155 --> 00:58:40,507
It hasn't changed

708
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:43,619
I've got something for Luci, I give it to her tomorrow

709
00:58:44,749 --> 00:58:46,197
Thank you Ahmad

710
00:58:53,287 --> 00:58:54,975
You smoke alot

711
00:58:58,351 --> 00:59:00,724
She hasn't been late this much before

712
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:04,817
I go after her

713
00:59:04,857 --> 00:59:05,957
Where?

714
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:09,692
I don't know...subway, street
Give me the car keys

715
00:59:09,693 --> 00:59:11,305
They're with youself

716
00:59:11,418 --> 00:59:13,047
Is it ok if I come?

717
00:59:15,264 --> 00:59:17,120
Ok, If you want

718
00:59:22,347 --> 00:59:25,885
Maybe she won't get back with him

719
00:59:35,219 --> 00:59:38,219
Why did she cry in the restaurant?

720
00:59:38,303 --> 00:59:40,051
Who told you?

721
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:43,955
I called Shahryar he told me she burst to tears

722
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:47,771
She hasn't been late this much before

723
00:59:47,863 --> 00:59:50,047
What did you tell her?

724
00:59:51,938 --> 00:59:54,403
Hadn't you told her that you're pregnant?

725
00:59:54,411 --> 00:59:56,027
Did you tell her?

726
00:59:56,772 --> 00:59:59,085
I thought she would back off

727
00:59:59,731 --> 01:00:01,760
That's why she isn't back

728
01:00:03,008 --> 01:00:03,964
You shouldn't have told her

729
01:00:04,025 --> 01:00:06,105
I didn't know

730
01:00:06,637 --> 01:00:09,930
You couldn't hide it forever

731
01:00:11,148 --> 01:00:13,041
Not in this situation

732
01:00:13,353 --> 01:00:15,730
Her problem isn't your preanancy

733
01:00:16,161 --> 01:00:18,061
What is it so?

734
01:00:19,972 --> 01:00:22,060
What is her problem? hmm?

735
01:00:22,569 --> 01:00:24,102
She knows everything

736
01:00:24,126 --> 01:00:25,626
She knows what?

737
01:00:27,402 --> 01:00:28,631
I can't find car keys

738
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:30,579
Search for them yourself

739
01:00:33,909 --> 01:00:35,106
we talk later

740
01:00:35,154 --> 01:00:37,599
What did you mean she knows evetything?

741
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:41,191
I don't get it

742
01:00:44,625 --> 01:00:48,658
She thinks his wife has committed suicide because of your relationship

743
01:00:52,033 --> 01:00:53,830
She killed herself because of...

744
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:55,803
I'll call you tomorrow

745
01:01:01,968 --> 01:01:03,856
Keys are not here

746
01:01:05,052 --> 01:01:06,104
I found them

747
01:01:06,196 --> 01:01:08,316
So what are you doing here?

748
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:09,379
What do you mean?

749
01:01:10,586 --> 01:01:12,519
Does anyone have a problem with me being here?

750
01:01:13,729 --> 01:01:14,613
I mean...

751
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,000
Enough

752
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,416
Wait for me please

753
01:01:34,681 --> 01:01:36,281
Ahmad

754
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:57,974
His wife had been depressed long time ago

755
01:01:57,975 --> 01:02:02,309
every time I took my clothes to his dry cleaning...
 he didn't feel well

756
01:02:02,391 --> 01:02:03,879
Why didn't he feel well?

757
01:02:04,877 --> 01:02:06,393
What do you mean why?

758
01:02:07,301 --> 01:02:08,249
Forget it

759
01:02:08,381 --> 01:02:10,934
Yoy can say nothing but When you do
you have to make it clear

760
01:02:10,986 --> 01:02:13,219
Look, you say he got a bad feeling whenever you saw him

761
01:02:13,231 --> 01:02:15,408
I didn't say he got, I said he had

762
01:02:15,882 --> 01:02:17,431
He didn't feel well

763
01:02:17,988 --> 01:02:20,085
Forget it, it's getting worse

764
01:02:22,596 --> 01:02:24,313
You want to hear that I'm guilty

765
01:02:24,382 --> 01:02:26,579
I don't want to hear anything

766
01:02:27,046 --> 01:02:29,659
You asked me talk to your daughter to see what's her problem

767
01:02:29,668 --> 01:02:33,026
Now I'm telling you what she thinks

768
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:35,327
She is making a mistake

769
01:02:39,542 --> 01:02:40,498
I'll tell her, if he comes

770
01:02:40,542 --> 01:02:42,435
What are you going to tell her?

771
01:02:43,587 --> 01:02:46,643
You think she believes you!?

772
01:02:50,911 --> 01:02:53,067
You don't believe it too

773
01:02:53,715 --> 01:02:56,016
You have to do something to make me believe it
She believes it

774
01:02:56,049 --> 01:02:58,426
Why don't you believe it, what's odd about it?

775
01:02:58,516 --> 01:03:02,910
I don'think a a mother with a five years old kid
may kill herself because of depression

776
01:03:05,045 --> 01:03:08,238
You are saying that!!!

777
01:03:08,754 --> 01:03:11,019
Don't you remember yourself??

778
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:25,077
A mother with a nine months old baby killed herself,
Was that because of me?

779
01:03:25,126 --> 01:03:27,031
when we were together...

780
01:03:27,662 --> 01:03:30,303
She had depression when she delivered her baby

781
01:03:32,382 --> 01:03:36,344
You know what kind of medicine he used to get for his wife?

782
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:44,381
How long are you going to stay in Paris?

783
01:03:44,386 --> 01:03:47,979
I haven't bought my ticket back yet, I don't know

784
01:03:50,084 --> 01:03:54,963
Couldn't you get a lawyer instead of coming here yourself?

785
01:03:56,985 --> 01:04:00,565
I prefered to come here myself to visit the girls and Marie

786
01:04:01,366 --> 01:04:05,271
To end everything in a good way

787
01:04:05,366 --> 01:04:08,379
Seemingly everrything isn't finished yet

788
01:04:08,451 --> 01:04:10,320
Somethings are left

789
01:04:10,996 --> 01:04:12,296
No

790
01:04:12,341 --> 01:04:14,538
Why do you think so?

791
01:04:16,489 --> 01:04:22,552
When two people see each other after four years and make a fight
It means that somethings are left

792
01:04:22,649 --> 01:04:24,918
Our argument was about Luci

793
01:04:25,284 --> 01:04:27,313
I'm her problem, yeah?

794
01:04:28,804 --> 01:04:29,904
No

795
01:04:29,928 --> 01:04:30,912
It's a misunderstanding

796
01:04:30,917 --> 01:04:32,865
About what?

797
01:04:38,044 --> 01:04:41,130
Something personal that I shouldn't know about?

798
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:42,575
No, It's not personal

799
01:04:42,668 --> 01:04:44,084
So tell me

800
01:04:44,167 --> 01:04:46,824
I don't know if you're aware of that or not, she is pregnant

801
01:04:46,828 --> 01:04:49,305
All the time stress, smoking and fight

802
01:04:49,409 --> 01:04:50,457
I'm worried about her, too

803
01:04:50,543 --> 01:04:53,336
She didn't smoke before

804
01:04:55,822 --> 01:04:57,553
I don't let that girl
to spoil everything

805
01:04:57,554 --> 01:04:59,360
she should talk to me if she
has any problem with me

806
01:04:59,456 --> 01:05:02,256
She dosen't have any problem, it's just a misunderstanding

807
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:05,631
What kind of misunderstanding is that has ruined my life

808
01:05:05,682 --> 01:05:07,819
Let Marie tell you

809
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,718
Don't involve her, ok?

810
01:05:14,801 --> 01:05:17,614
She thinks something else about your wife suicide

811
01:05:23,073 --> 01:05:25,931
That she has killed herself because of our relationship

812
01:05:25,991 --> 01:05:28,052
You know it yourself

813
01:05:28,915 --> 01:05:30,680
I heard you saying that to Marie

814
01:05:30,686 --> 01:05:32,086
Really?

815
01:05:36,262 --> 01:05:41,435
She did that to herself over a silly fight with a client

816
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:45,243
I've been told that sha had depression

817
01:05:45,248 --> 01:05:50,145
She wouldn't have done it, if she hadn't

818
01:05:51,652 --> 01:05:54,600
A silly fight

819
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:56,971
What sould I do that
Luci doesn't believe it?

820
01:05:56,972 --> 01:06:00,454
Tomorrow I send my worker to
talk to her who was there

821
01:06:21,037 --> 01:06:23,714
Call the police and give them her characteristic

822
01:06:23,809 --> 01:06:25,582
Has it happend before?

823
01:06:25,656 --> 01:06:28,640
No, it's her first time

824
01:06:29,847 --> 01:06:31,816
Maybe he is with his father

825
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:34,350
Brussels?

826
01:06:35,016 --> 01:06:37,713
Isn't her father in Paris?

827
01:06:38,631 --> 01:06:40,415
He has gone back to Brussels

828
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,435
Is it possible that she goes there?

829
01:06:42,474 --> 01:06:43,774
No

830
01:06:45,245 --> 01:06:48,146
She doesn't have a good relationship with her father

831
01:06:52,114 --> 01:06:55,191
Do you want me to call him?

832
01:06:58,238 --> 01:07:00,126
Let Ahmad do that

833
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:14,389
I don't think she has gone to Brussels

834
01:07:18,613 --> 01:07:20,633
I call him myself

835
01:07:21,452 --> 01:07:23,349
Ok, give me his number

836
01:07:25,668 --> 01:07:28,017
Shahryar called, he wants you to call him back

837
01:07:28,018 --> 01:07:29,266
Where is the phone?

838
01:07:29,326 --> 01:07:30,774
In the kitchen

839
01:07:39,536 --> 01:07:41,433
Why does she think so?

840
01:07:41,531 --> 01:07:43,175
About what?

841
01:07:44,883 --> 01:07:46,976
About Cline suicide

842
01:07:51,207 --> 01:07:52,551
I don't know

843
01:08:04,724 --> 01:08:05,824
Here it is

844
01:08:05,845 --> 01:08:07,393
Her father's number

845
01:08:07,846 --> 01:08:09,583
Don't make him worried

846
01:08:09,637 --> 01:08:11,293
She is with Shahryar

847
01:08:14,962 --> 01:08:19,315
She went to his restaurant then he took her to his home

848
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:27,609
He called here twice,
why didn't he tell me anything

849
01:08:29,124 --> 01:08:30,748
He knew how much worried I was

850
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,093
Let me explain

851
01:08:32,161 --> 01:08:34,366
Why didn't he tell me she was there

852
01:08:34,409 --> 01:08:37,811
I was about to die, why he told me nothing?

853
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:39,491
Ok, I explain

854
01:08:39,565 --> 01:08:41,742
What are you going to explain? hmm?

855
01:08:42,066 --> 01:08:45,135
What do you want to explain?

856
01:08:46,584 --> 01:08:47,684
What happened?

857
01:08:47,705 --> 01:08:48,517
Nothing

858
01:08:48,602 --> 01:08:51,084
I told you once in the car,
 if anything happens you tell me not her

859
01:08:51,149 --> 01:08:53,371
And I tell you don't shout at me

860
01:08:53,468 --> 01:08:55,781
Why didn't he tell me Luci was there?

861
01:08:55,864 --> 01:08:57,429
Luci made him promise

862
01:08:57,769 --> 01:08:58,813
Whose house?

863
01:08:58,857 --> 01:09:01,654
She had agreed to stay there
on the condition that he tell no one

864
01:09:01,716 --> 01:09:04,633
He made a promise to hide a sixteen years old girl,
why did he take her to his home?

865
01:09:04,667 --> 01:09:09,013
What do you mean hiding her?
he took pity on her

866
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:10,431
He cares about her not her mother

867
01:09:10,442 --> 01:09:11,422
Where are the keys?

868
01:09:11,427 --> 01:09:12,747
What for?

869
01:09:12,824 --> 01:09:16,349
She has to get back, sit there and talk to me

870
01:09:16,863 --> 01:09:17,563
Now

871
01:09:17,589 --> 01:09:18,301
Right now

872
01:09:18,392 --> 01:09:19,853
She thinks we don't know where she is

873
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:21,250
I don't care

874
01:09:23,566 --> 01:09:30,064
She needs to see what a mess she has made.
her suicide has nothing to do with us

875
01:09:33,203 --> 01:09:35,040
She doesn't get back with you.

876
01:09:35,181 --> 01:09:36,542
I call the police if she doesn't

877
01:09:36,694 --> 01:09:38,627
I really call the police

878
01:09:38,652 --> 01:09:43,301
Police can get her back tonight.
What about the other nights

879
01:09:43,608 --> 01:09:49,165
She stays here or goes to Brussels to her father

880
01:09:49,446 --> 01:09:52,943
She won't get back till I'm here

881
01:10:10,743 --> 01:10:11,743
Come in...

882
01:10:12,843 --> 01:10:14,943
Why are you so late?

883
01:10:15,943 --> 01:10:17,643
Don't you have an umbrella?

884
01:10:18,143 --> 01:10:19,143
No

885
01:10:20,143 --> 01:10:22,143
Put it here

886
01:10:22,743 --> 01:10:24,543
How did you get here?

887
01:10:24,543 --> 01:10:25,643
Subway

888
01:10:25,643 --> 01:10:26,843
You'd better take a taxi

889
01:10:27,143 --> 01:10:28,843
I couldn't find one

890
01:10:28,843 --> 01:10:30,843
You've put yourself in trouble.

891
01:10:31,443 --> 01:10:32,943
Is she awake?

892
01:10:33,843 --> 01:10:34,843
She fell asleep

893
01:10:34,843 --> 01:10:36,133
When did she come to you?

894
01:10:36,133 --> 01:10:38,433
That was late...
I thought she was waiting for you

895
01:10:38,433 --> 01:10:41,633
You should've informed us at once
Her was about to die...

896
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:44,033
How?...You don't have cellphone!

897
01:10:44,133 --> 01:10:47,093
I called her home to find you
But you were not there either

898
01:10:47,393 --> 01:10:50,300
I feard if I tell her mother, she would leave

899
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:51,700
What has happened?

900
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:55,400
Some illusions...

901
01:11:16,453 --> 01:11:20,134
Sorry to wake you up.

902
01:11:25,327 --> 01:11:28,848
She wanted to come herself, but I asked her not

903
01:11:29,991 --> 01:11:31,803
Let's go

904
01:11:31,957 --> 01:11:33,041
Where is your coat?

905
01:11:33,128 --> 01:11:35,189
No, I don't go there.

906
01:11:36,964 --> 01:11:40,525
I don't want to get back tonight.

907
01:11:40,575 --> 01:11:44,516
Ok, I call her talk to her yourself

908
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:59,016
Allo Marie?

909
01:11:59,117 --> 01:12:01,243
She wants to talk to you

910
01:12:03,627 --> 01:12:06,939
Yeah

911
01:12:08,714 --> 01:12:11,438
I saty here tonight.

912
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:17,355
Why did you hang it up?

913
01:12:17,393 --> 01:12:19,809
She put the phone down.

914
01:12:24,971 --> 01:12:26,683
Let's go.

915
01:12:26,729 --> 01:12:27,929
No.

916
01:12:36,616 --> 01:12:37,960
Get up.

917
01:12:37,989 --> 01:12:40,386
I want to talk to you.

918
01:12:56,184 --> 01:12:59,793
I want you to listen to me carefully.

919
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:05,301
I don't know how well you can remember
 the last months that I was with your mother

920
01:13:05,666 --> 01:13:07,986
You remember anything?

921
01:13:12,047 --> 01:13:14,184
You remember how bad my situation was?

922
01:13:14,238 --> 01:13:15,638
Yeah.

923
01:13:15,967 --> 01:13:17,887
I didn't feel well at all.

924
01:13:17,928 --> 01:13:23,415
I didn't work. I didn't get out.
I just wanted not to exist anymore.

925
01:13:23,415 --> 01:13:26,904
That's why when your mother
says that woman committed suicide

926
01:13:26,905 --> 01:13:30,393
bacause of depression
I completely understand.

927
01:13:30,397 --> 01:13:31,570
Even if she had a little kid.

928
01:13:31,594 --> 01:13:35,231
Did you think about suicide much?

929
01:13:36,655 --> 01:13:38,511
Yes, sometimes.

930
01:13:38,585 --> 01:13:41,670
Like drinking laundry liquid in front of us.

931
01:13:42,144 --> 01:13:43,544
What?

932
01:13:45,131 --> 01:13:46,631
No.

933
01:13:49,982 --> 01:13:54,670
You think when a woman drinks
laundry liquid and tries to kills herself,

934
01:13:54,671 --> 01:14:01,650
when his husband is enjoying himself,
 she only wants to die?

935
01:14:03,643 --> 01:14:08,200
Why not taking pills on her bed?

936
01:14:13,611 --> 01:14:20,541
We can sit here and make up thousands of these stories.
But they're only a guess.

937
01:14:20,612 --> 01:14:26,527
Tomorrow we're going to meet Samir's worker.
She has something to tell you.

938
01:14:46,027 --> 01:14:51,304
Tell her I'm gone. 
She can get back now.

939
01:14:55,173 --> 01:14:57,034
We would better not be here for a while.

940
01:15:55,635 --> 01:15:57,690
Fouad...get off

941
01:16:23,314 --> 01:16:24,858
Get up.

942
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:27,341
Leave me.

943
01:16:27,426 --> 01:16:29,810
I told you get up.

944
01:16:29,888 --> 01:16:32,021
Come on. Stop it.

945
01:16:36,118 --> 01:16:37,018
Thanks.

946
01:16:37,213 --> 01:16:41,482
What are you doing?
When I tell you get off, you have to do it.

947
01:16:41,692 --> 01:16:46,217
Look at me. When I'm talking listen to me.

948
01:16:47,395 --> 01:16:48,095
Leave me.

949
01:16:48,191 --> 01:16:48,935
What did you say?

950
01:16:48,946 --> 01:16:50,546
Leave me.

951
01:16:53,669 --> 01:16:57,698
Don't do that again to me.
Why is that?

952
01:16:58,051 --> 01:17:00,424
Look at me. What is it?

953
01:17:12,157 --> 01:17:13,873
Take your pillow.

954
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:15,359
No.

955
01:17:17,659 --> 01:17:20,159
What's wrong with you?

956
01:17:25,294 --> 01:17:28,318
Fouad, Speak up.

957
01:17:28,573 --> 01:17:31,574
I want to get back to Marie home.

958
01:17:31,726 --> 01:17:33,632
We have to get back to our own home for a while.

959
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:36,189
you said we live there no more.

960
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:38,273
Forever.

961
01:17:38,869 --> 01:17:42,578
Yeah. But now is different.

962
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:44,747
Because that man came?

963
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:47,294
No.

964
01:17:47,964 --> 01:17:49,230
Because I was naughty yesterday?

965
01:17:49,232 --> 01:17:50,632
No.

966
01:17:52,097 --> 01:17:55,466
Why does Luci hate you?

967
01:17:58,846 --> 01:18:01,871
Because she thinks I want to take her mothar away from her.

968
01:18:01,933 --> 01:18:04,070
She doesn't like her mother too.

969
01:18:04,137 --> 01:18:06,987
Of course she does. Like all the kids.

970
01:18:07,443 --> 01:18:11,856
Like you.. Didn't you miss your mom?

971
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:17,662
Mom is not home.

972
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,490
Do you want to see her?
Do you want me to take to her?

973
01:18:21,524 --> 01:18:22,724
No.

974
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:26,993
Why?

975
01:18:28,855 --> 01:18:30,707
I'm afraid

976
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:32,318
Of mom?

977
01:18:33,095 --> 01:18:34,739
Of that man.

978
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:38,715
Why do you say that Fouad?

979
01:18:40,143 --> 01:18:43,072
If he hadn't been there they wouldn't
 have kept her in the hospital

980
01:18:43,073 --> 01:18:45,537
and unplugged the wires.

981
01:18:45,762 --> 01:18:50,279
Does she die if they unplug the wires?

982
01:18:58,354 --> 01:19:01,815
Why don't they do that?

983
01:19:05,858 --> 01:19:12,725
Because they don't know if she wants to live with that wires or not

984
01:19:12,897 --> 01:19:15,017
She wants to die.

985
01:19:16,152 --> 01:19:17,672
How do you know?

986
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:22,742
When someone commits suicide 
it means that he wants to die.

987
01:19:36,488 --> 01:19:38,304
Sorry dad.

988
01:19:47,623 --> 01:19:51,247
Here it is. That stain.

989
01:19:51,345 --> 01:19:53,518
Did his wife work there?

990
01:19:53,606 --> 01:20:00,693
A couple of days. Samir asked her to come...
for a change of mood.

991
01:20:02,168 --> 01:20:05,389
That day Cline went on a fight with one of the clients.

992
01:20:05,402 --> 01:20:07,058
"Cline" his wife?

993
01:20:07,098 --> 01:20:08,982
Yes his wife.

994
01:20:09,047 --> 01:20:13,462
She had a fight because that client insisted
that her clothes were stained here.

995
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:19,583
But Cline told her that they had been stained before.

996
01:20:21,278 --> 01:20:22,278
That's all?

997
01:20:22,304 --> 01:20:26,441
Yeah. Then I said we wash her clothes again she can take them tomorrow.

998
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:32,676
Then Cline got angry with me and said no one asked
you anything I'm the one makes decision here.

999
01:20:34,757 --> 01:20:40,187
She said these clothes were stained before and it has
nothing to do with us and then threw it out of the store.

1000
01:20:40,255 --> 01:20:43,372
And that client called the police.

1001
01:20:43,619 --> 01:20:47,636
I wanted to get out of the store.

1002
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:49,307
Are you a illegal worker here?

1003
01:20:49,377 --> 01:20:50,770
Yes I am.

1004
01:20:50,824 --> 01:20:57,587
Cline asked me to stay and tell the police
that her clothes were stained before.

1005
01:20:57,964 --> 01:21:01,979
I didn't know waht to do. Then I quietly called Samir to come.

1006
01:21:02,419 --> 01:21:08,950
When he came he made an apology to her
and accepted to pay for the damage caused

1007
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:17,358
That client agreed on the condition that
 Cline make an apology

1008
01:21:18,459 --> 01:21:26,713
Cline said no and then started fighting with me for calling Samir.

1009
01:21:27,947 --> 01:21:39,087
When I gathered up my stuff to go Samir caught my hand
and told me to saty and asked his wife to leave.

1010
01:21:39,099 --> 01:21:44,924
He fired her in front of me and that client and I stayed.

1011
01:21:45,902 --> 01:21:49,287
How many days later she atempted suicide?

1012
01:21:49,973 --> 01:21:51,334
About four or five.

1013
01:21:57,097 --> 01:21:58,313
Can I go?

1014
01:21:58,376 --> 01:21:59,876
Merci.

1015
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:28,012
That's the way depression is.

1016
01:22:28,016 --> 01:22:30,557
You kill yourself for nothing.

1017
01:22:33,736 --> 01:22:41,290
One day before Cline suicide I sent her all the
love affair E-mails between Samir and my mother.

1018
01:23:32,739 --> 01:23:35,872
What are you gonna do now?

1019
01:23:37,424 --> 01:23:39,040
I go to Brussels.

1020
01:23:39,117 --> 01:23:45,647
That's nonsense, you don't stay with your father
even for two days, you have to get back to your mother.

1021
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:56,933
I can't stand to see someone everyday who I caused
his wife kill herselef. I can't look at her kid.

1022
01:23:57,289 --> 01:23:58,873
Take a sit.

1023
01:24:07,979 --> 01:24:09,435
Do you want me to help you?

1024
01:24:09,491 --> 01:24:10,960
You don't want to talk to my mom, do you?

1025
01:24:11,055 --> 01:24:11,855
Listen.

1026
01:24:11,935 --> 01:24:12,691
I don't.

1027
01:24:12,766 --> 01:24:15,831
I told you take a sit.

1028
01:24:21,112 --> 01:24:22,312
Sit down.

1029
01:24:25,697 --> 01:24:27,194
I shouldn't have told you.

1030
01:24:27,197 --> 01:24:28,597
Listen.

1031
01:24:30,116 --> 01:24:34,758
You have two choices, 
you can keep it secret and be in torment forever

1032
01:24:35,817 --> 01:24:37,926
or tell your mom everything

1033
01:24:38,619 --> 01:24:40,240
What's the difference?

1034
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:43,205
It may have an impact on her getting married.

1035
01:24:43,283 --> 01:24:45,800
She won't change her decision. She's pregnant.

1036
01:24:46,567 --> 01:24:54,689
Imagine she learns when she has his baby,
 It's too late then.

1037
01:24:54,939 --> 01:24:58,673
If I'd wanted I could've told her during the last months.

1038
01:24:59,355 --> 01:25:08,165
It doesn't matter what you want, You should see
if it's important for your mothar to know or not

1039
01:25:11,095 --> 01:25:15,028
She deserves to know.

1040
01:25:25,169 --> 01:25:26,849
Hi mom.

1041
01:25:27,458 --> 01:25:29,703
You ok? Would you open the door for me?

1042
01:25:30,462 --> 01:25:31,750
Did you get me potato crisp?

1043
01:25:31,772 --> 01:25:33,384
Yes I did.

1044
01:25:53,797 --> 01:25:56,197
You're here!!

1045
01:25:56,426 --> 01:25:59,787
I was upstairs with Luci.

1046
01:25:59,819 --> 01:26:01,119
Are you ok?

1047
01:26:02,654 --> 01:26:04,419
How was your meeting?

1048
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:07,374
What meeting?

1049
01:26:08,327 --> 01:26:10,528
With Samir's worker.

1050
01:26:10,675 --> 01:26:12,459
Yeah...not bad.

1051
01:26:15,248 --> 01:26:16,548
Well?

1052
01:26:17,875 --> 01:26:21,304
You didn't tell Luci that I was coming?

1053
01:26:21,398 --> 01:26:22,298
No.

1054
01:26:22,351 --> 01:26:24,420
So how did she know it?

1055
01:26:25,322 --> 01:26:26,806
Did she know it?

1056
01:26:29,937 --> 01:26:30,838
How?

1057
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,384
I don't know.

1058
01:26:33,132 --> 01:26:35,473
Maybe she checks your E-mails.

1059
01:26:37,775 --> 01:26:38,899
Where do you put it?

1060
01:26:38,945 --> 01:26:40,357
Something happend?

1061
01:26:47,059 --> 01:26:48,796
Are you in the mood of taking a walk?

1062
01:26:48,813 --> 01:26:50,513
No I'm tired?

1063
01:26:53,201 --> 01:26:54,781
What's wrong Ahmad?

1064
01:27:00,123 --> 01:27:02,889
You want to live with father?

1065
01:27:03,907 --> 01:27:06,608
If you go I'll come with you.

1066
01:27:08,293 --> 01:27:10,266
You need to saty with mom.

1067
01:27:10,398 --> 01:27:11,827
I want to be with you.

1068
01:27:13,741 --> 01:27:16,297
Don't think about these matters.

1069
01:27:20,427 --> 01:27:23,992
Father's wife is strange, isn't she?

1070
01:27:46,264 --> 01:27:47,949
It's ok.

1071
01:28:17,915 --> 01:28:19,271
Is he right?

1072
01:28:25,316 --> 01:28:27,449
Why did you do that to me?

1073
01:28:29,015 --> 01:28:32,200
Why did you do that to me? What did I do to deserve this?
you piece of shit

1074
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,660
What did I do to you?

1075
01:28:34,161 --> 01:28:36,213
Let her go Marie

1076
01:28:38,624 --> 01:28:40,325
Come down...Come down

1077
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:43,784
Take it easy.

1078
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:46,119
Let go of my hand...Let go of my hand

1079
01:28:46,179 --> 01:28:49,829
Don't do this...Didn't you promise?

1080
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:51,420
Get out of this house.

1081
01:28:52,818 --> 01:28:54,474
Go out for a moment.

1082
01:28:54,602 --> 01:28:55,402
Leave me alone.

1083
01:28:55,498 --> 01:28:58,211
She is in a difficult situation herself

1084
01:29:00,542 --> 01:29:03,307
I asked her to tell you.

1085
01:29:03,370 --> 01:29:07,656
She could keep it hidden.

1086
01:29:09,304 --> 01:29:10,525
Was it better?

1087
01:29:10,574 --> 01:29:12,594
You don'talk.

1088
01:29:14,336 --> 01:29:17,197
Why are you still here? Get out of this house.

1089
01:29:17,258 --> 01:29:19,395
Get lost.

1090
01:29:19,415 --> 01:29:20,616
I don't want to see you anymore.

1091
01:29:20,670 --> 01:29:22,350
Stop it.

1092
01:29:24,502 --> 01:29:26,018
Go to your room.

1093
01:29:27,008 --> 01:29:28,620
Go dear.

1094
01:29:32,093 --> 01:29:37,446
Keep it in your mind that it was you who
 wrote them She just re-send them.

1095
01:29:33,775 --> 01:29:35,948


1096
01:29:37,426 --> 01:29:39,570
I don't want to listen to you...Go

1097
01:29:39,842 --> 01:29:43,852
I hate it when you make as if you're a good man 
and want to give me lessions.

1098
01:29:43,853 --> 01:29:46,154
I don't want to give you lessions.

1099
01:29:46,511 --> 01:29:49,984
You told me to come here and talk to Luci.

1100
01:29:50,064 --> 01:29:55,575
It wasn't for Luci that I asked you to come,
It was for that fucking divorce paper

1101
01:29:56,403 --> 01:29:57,203
Listen

1102
01:29:57,276 --> 01:29:58,765
Not to see you after four years...forever

1103
01:29:58,812 --> 01:30:00,312
Listen

1104
01:30:00,663 --> 01:30:04,020
Why didn't you tell me to come last year?

1105
01:30:04,992 --> 01:30:08,081
Why you told me come in this shit?

1106
01:30:08,382 --> 01:30:09,394
Shame on you.

1107
01:30:09,421 --> 01:30:11,703
You wanted to get married without telling me.

1108
01:30:11,733 --> 01:30:13,094
Go check your e-mails...

1109
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:14,597
You didn't book any hotel.

1110
01:30:14,778 --> 01:30:16,071
Don't talk rubbish.

1111
01:30:16,241 --> 01:30:20,691
You made me to sleep with his kid in one room, why?

1112
01:30:22,557 --> 01:30:23,513
I sent you that e-mail.

1113
01:30:23,571 --> 01:30:28,489
You brought me here to avenge.

1114
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:31,483
Yeah, You're right. You happy now?

1115
01:30:36,177 --> 01:30:41,534
Then you tell me you're pregnant in court.

1116
01:30:42,447 --> 01:30:44,448
Why?

1117
01:30:51,222 --> 01:30:53,019
Don't you want to go?

1118
01:30:53,477 --> 01:30:56,578
Go for God's sake...Go

1119
01:31:00,184 --> 01:31:01,284
Just go...

1120
01:31:01,376 --> 01:31:02,888
She's leaving...

1121
01:31:08,167 --> 01:31:10,240
Luci, Where're you going? Get back

1122
01:31:10,261 --> 01:31:12,874
Who are you to tell me what to do?

1123
01:31:12,954 --> 01:31:16,096
Please Luci...Don't make it worse.

1124
01:31:16,109 --> 01:31:17,193
Why did you tell her?

1125
01:31:17,242 --> 01:31:18,462
you allow it.

1126
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,156
You made me.

1127
01:31:20,181 --> 01:31:24,218
I didn't want you to be in torment for the rest of your life.

1128
01:31:24,258 --> 01:31:27,723
I'm not now?

1129
01:31:29,592 --> 01:31:32,645
Is everything ok now?

1130
01:31:36,999 --> 01:31:38,647
Wait...

1131
01:31:54,307 --> 01:31:56,208
Have you got some money?

1132
01:31:56,211 --> 01:32:00,240
Hold on...I come with you.

1133
01:32:02,809 --> 01:32:04,009
Hold on...

1134
01:32:11,595 --> 01:32:13,607
I go myself

1135
01:32:30,136 --> 01:32:31,436
Ahmad

1136
01:32:41,483 --> 01:32:43,848
Can I ask you something?

1137
01:32:44,287 --> 01:32:45,487
What?

1138
01:32:48,187 --> 01:32:50,193
What was in those e-mails?

1139
01:32:50,274 --> 01:32:51,618
I don't know.

1140
01:33:17,910 --> 01:33:19,094
Get back home

1141
01:33:38,295 --> 01:33:39,011
Ahamd

1142
01:33:39,912 --> 01:33:42,414
Ahamd...look at me

1143
01:33:42,815 --> 01:33:45,310
If you stretch it anymore, you're done...

1144
01:33:45,311 --> 01:33:46,094
Cut

1145
01:33:47,795 --> 01:33:49,171
You remember me and Mitra?

1146
01:33:49,172 --> 01:33:49,727
Cut

1147
01:33:53,828 --> 01:33:56,966
This word can go on without me and you !!

1148
01:33:59,667 --> 01:34:02,300
Sometimes I think if I hadn't gone for years ago...

1149
01:34:02,301 --> 01:34:04,697
If you hadn't gone four years ago 
you'd gone the next year

1150
01:34:05,698 --> 01:34:07,759
Not one year after...two years after

1151
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:12,824
You didn't belong here...

1152
01:34:13,125 --> 01:34:15,177
What did I tell you the frist day?

1153
01:34:15,478 --> 01:34:20,490
You have to chose to be here or there...

1154
01:34:42,647 --> 01:34:44,467
You wanna tell him?

1155
01:34:48,519 --> 01:34:51,307
You can tell him nothing.

1156
01:34:56,934 --> 01:34:58,786
Go to sleep.

1157
01:35:01,994 --> 01:35:03,923
Turn the lights off.

1158
01:35:29,781 --> 01:35:30,961
Is Samir here?

1159
01:35:31,035 --> 01:35:32,451
Yeah..Upstairs

1160
01:35:39,046 --> 01:35:39,946
Hello.

1161
01:35:40,045 --> 01:35:41,393
Hello Fouad

1162
01:35:59,641 --> 01:36:00,441
You ok?

1163
01:36:00,495 --> 01:36:01,295
Yes

1164
01:36:01,394 --> 01:36:02,506
Do you have a minute?

1165
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:04,190
Yeah

1166
01:36:04,262 --> 01:36:05,959
Come in.

1167
01:36:15,885 --> 01:36:17,197
What are they?

1168
01:36:17,232 --> 01:36:19,148
Her perfumes.

1169
01:36:20,861 --> 01:36:26,503
I take them to hospital for test.
Her nurse said sense of smell is the last step

1170
01:36:39,952 --> 01:36:41,940
This one is yours.

1171
01:36:45,033 --> 01:36:46,999
She liked it.

1172
01:36:52,087 --> 01:36:53,387
What's up?

1173
01:36:53,455 --> 01:36:54,855
Nothing

1174
01:37:02,274 --> 01:37:03,858
Why don't you come in?

1175
01:37:03,858 --> 01:37:05,402
I have to go.

1176
01:37:11,042 --> 01:37:12,955
I don't like to hide your happiness from me.

1177
01:37:12,965 --> 01:37:15,338
I'm not hiding anything.

1178
01:37:15,353 --> 01:37:21,168
You mean you're not happy!!
It's a good news that she reacts to something.

1179
01:37:21,355 --> 01:37:23,388
What do you like me to answer you?

1180
01:37:36,839 --> 01:37:39,968
You stuck between me and her.

1181
01:37:45,848 --> 01:37:48,817
Did you come to this conclusion at one night?

1182
01:37:48,865 --> 01:37:50,265
No.

1183
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,557
It's been a long time.

1184
01:37:54,647 --> 01:37:55,947
When?

1185
01:37:58,696 --> 01:38:00,748
What do you mean when?

1186
01:38:03,469 --> 01:38:07,787
Because you didn't speak like that till the last week.

1187
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,477
I didn't dare to...

1188
01:38:15,968 --> 01:38:18,061
Maybe I wasn't sure

1189
01:38:19,105 --> 01:38:20,998
Sure about what?

1190
01:38:22,001 --> 01:38:25,666
I feel I'm only going to fill her empty place.

1191
01:38:27,263 --> 01:38:30,520
Whose empty place am I going to fill?

1192
01:38:32,512 --> 01:38:33,512
No one

1193
01:38:33,601 --> 01:38:35,301
You sure?

1194
01:38:36,833 --> 01:38:41,682
That I'm not a compensation for your unrequited love?

1195
01:38:42,862 --> 01:38:44,675
If it was so, I wouldn't get pregnant.

1196
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:46,869
It was something unwanted.

1197
01:38:56,007 --> 01:38:58,608
I could abort him.

1198
01:39:03,257 --> 01:39:07,138
You kept him to forget that man.

1199
01:39:07,274 --> 01:39:11,353
Believe me this relationship has come to an end !!!

1200
01:39:14,213 --> 01:39:20,074
You wouldn't beleive it. Otherwise you let him go to hotel.

1201
01:39:20,945 --> 01:39:26,136
You think I don't know why you feel bad?
I don't know you anymore.

1202
01:39:29,885 --> 01:39:32,514
I feel bad because I know why your wife committed suicide.

1203
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:35,015
Do not involve her, Ok?

1204
01:39:36,655 --> 01:39:37,839
Your wife knew it.

1205
01:39:37,894 --> 01:39:41,908
Don't repeat the nonsense that your daughter says.

1206
01:39:51,606 --> 01:39:55,627
Finally she would've told me, if she had known it.

1207
01:40:08,991 --> 01:40:11,236
She never asked you anything about me?

1208
01:40:11,524 --> 01:40:13,413
Like what?

1209
01:40:14,367 --> 01:40:19,212
Don't know, Why you go out and come back that much!

1210
01:40:21,042 --> 01:40:23,287
No, You were like the other clients.

1211
01:40:26,929 --> 01:40:28,899
What about you? Wasn't she suspicious about you?

1212
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:30,150
No.

1213
01:40:32,714 --> 01:40:34,498
I wish she were.

1214
01:40:34,686 --> 01:40:38,699
I wish she were worried that I'm with someone or not.

1215
01:40:38,927 --> 01:40:41,716
Thus I knew I was important to her.

1216
01:41:34,355 --> 01:41:38,132
Luci sent her our e-mails.

1217
01:41:44,786 --> 01:41:47,983
How did she get her e-mail?

1218
01:41:48,669 --> 01:41:50,857
Your wife gave her.

1219
01:41:50,978 --> 01:41:53,207
Had she met her?

1220
01:41:53,222 --> 01:42:02,636
Luci calls the dry cleaning and tells your wife that
she has some of our e-mails that wants to send her.

1221
01:42:03,957 --> 01:42:08,413
And your wife told her to send them.

1222
01:42:17,952 --> 01:42:20,773
When did she call her?

1223
01:42:22,563 --> 01:42:25,763
The day before her suicied.

1224
01:42:43,889 --> 01:42:45,850
Nama come here.

1225
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:03,022
After that fight that I told my wife to leave here...

1226
01:43:03,584 --> 01:43:04,584
ok

1227
01:43:04,667 --> 01:43:06,733
Did she used to come when I wasn't here?

1228
01:43:06,813 --> 01:43:08,313
No.

1229
01:43:09,661 --> 01:43:11,934
When she wanted to go up

1230
01:43:11,996 --> 01:43:15,185
The last days I didn't see her to go up.

1231
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:27,713
Didn't she never come down?

1232
01:43:27,877 --> 01:43:30,454
Yeah. Just the last day.

1233
01:43:31,162 --> 01:43:32,662
How about before?

1234
01:43:32,781 --> 01:43:34,181
No, Why?

1235
01:43:34,189 --> 01:43:39,046
I've been told that someone has
called here and talked to my wife.

1236
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:44,480
You can go.

1237
01:43:56,449 --> 01:43:57,549
Thanks.

1238
01:43:57,610 --> 01:43:58,210
Take it.

1239
01:43:58,283 --> 01:44:00,003
I get back.

1240
01:45:14,102 --> 01:45:15,518
Sorry mom.

1241
01:45:25,833 --> 01:45:27,998
Just don't lie to me again.

1242
01:45:33,603 --> 01:45:36,627
What did I lie you about?

1243
01:45:41,798 --> 01:45:44,476
That you send those e-mails.

1244
01:45:51,022 --> 01:45:52,602
Do you promise me?

1245
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:58,040
Ok?

1246
01:46:01,162 --> 01:46:04,567
Why do you think that I lied to you?

1247
01:46:06,859 --> 01:46:11,208
Because she wasn't in dry cleaning the day before her suicide.

1248
01:46:27,255 --> 01:46:29,116
But I talked to her.

1249
01:46:30,318 --> 01:46:31,018
No.

1250
01:46:31,096 --> 01:46:32,944
Yes I did.

1251
01:46:32,957 --> 01:46:34,377
She had an accent.

1252
01:46:34,429 --> 01:46:36,377
His wife is french.

1253
01:46:51,969 --> 01:46:53,369
Hello.

1254
01:47:12,757 --> 01:47:14,281
Why did you do that?

1255
01:47:14,361 --> 01:47:15,961
What?

1256
01:47:16,395 --> 01:47:18,419
Why did you do that?

1257
01:47:18,466 --> 01:47:19,210
What?

1258
01:47:19,309 --> 01:47:24,638
Why did you introduced yourself instead of my wife and
give that girl her e-mail address?

1259
01:47:28,629 --> 01:47:30,129
I'm sorry.

1260
01:47:34,445 --> 01:47:37,458
I don't want you to say sorry, Just tell me why.

1261
01:47:40,790 --> 01:47:42,390
Speak up.

1262
01:47:43,064 --> 01:47:44,120
She didn't like me.

1263
01:47:44,158 --> 01:47:47,551
She didn't like you? why?
Had you done something?

1264
01:47:47,603 --> 01:47:48,303
No.

1265
01:47:48,337 --> 01:47:51,037
So why didn't she like you?

1266
01:47:55,392 --> 01:47:57,973
She believed there is something between me and you.

1267
01:47:58,032 --> 01:47:59,929
She believed so?

1268
01:47:59,974 --> 01:48:03,523
Why? Why did she think so?

1269
01:48:03,531 --> 01:48:08,046
Because you let me work here without any paper.
she was supicious of me.

1270
01:48:08,657 --> 01:48:10,757
Did she tell you anything?

1271
01:48:10,844 --> 01:48:11,644
No.

1272
01:48:11,771 --> 01:48:13,704
So what are these bullshits?

1273
01:48:16,367 --> 01:48:19,860
I think she always wanted to get rid of me.

1274
01:48:19,957 --> 01:48:22,201
You think?

1275
01:48:26,757 --> 01:48:27,757
Out.

1276
01:48:29,028 --> 01:48:31,425
She never asked me to fire you.

1277
01:48:31,464 --> 01:48:33,125
But she always...

1278
01:48:35,070 --> 01:48:37,292
She always used to do something that you fire me.

1279
01:48:37,302 --> 01:48:39,482
Like waht? hmm?

1280
01:48:42,179 --> 01:48:43,948
Ha? I asked you like waht?

1281
01:48:47,451 --> 01:48:48,299
Many things.

1282
01:48:48,391 --> 01:48:49,907
Like waht?

1283
01:48:50,008 --> 01:48:50,924
Like waht?

1284
01:48:51,009 --> 01:48:52,109
Sorry

1285
01:48:53,523 --> 01:48:55,039
Like waht?

1286
01:48:57,450 --> 01:49:03,709
The day that client called the police she didn't let me go.
She said I had to saty.

1287
01:49:05,416 --> 01:49:06,900
It doesn't have any relationship.

1288
01:49:06,935 --> 01:49:10,609
She wanted the police know that I'm not allowed to work here.

1289
01:49:11,606 --> 01:49:13,006
Just this?

1290
01:49:13,741 --> 01:49:17,046
That's why she is in coma now?

1291
01:49:17,987 --> 01:49:19,167
Get lost!

1292
01:49:19,246 --> 01:49:26,350
I washed, ironed and put in cover the clothes we had a fight about.

1293
01:49:26,879 --> 01:49:27,891
Get out.

1294
01:49:27,964 --> 01:49:32,182
I'm sure there was no stain on them.
She did it herself on purpose.

1295
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:35,697
I'm here for one year, No clothes is stained like that before.

1296
01:49:35,757 --> 01:49:37,718
How much of your payment is left?

1297
01:49:37,738 --> 01:49:40,187
That's what I do everydaY
There was no stain on those clothes.

1298
01:49:41,144 --> 01:49:47,539
I swear to God those clothes weren't stained.
She did that on purpose.

1299
01:49:52,069 --> 01:49:53,369
Get lost.

1300
01:49:57,197 --> 01:49:58,709
Get out.

1301
01:50:51,140 --> 01:50:55,897
I just wanted her to know that there is nothing between me and you.

1302
01:50:55,937 --> 01:51:04,652
You were always in a bad mood and thinking about someone else.
But she thought it's because of me.

1303
01:51:09,071 --> 01:51:21,635
That day when you took my hand and didn't let me go
insted, you booted her out of, I looked upon her eyes

1304
01:51:22,273 --> 01:51:25,082
I know what she was thinking.

1305
01:51:25,122 --> 01:51:33,849
You know what you did...mother of a eight years
old boy is in the hospital like a piece of meat.

1306
01:51:36,696 --> 01:51:38,180
I didn't do anything.

1307
01:51:38,502 --> 01:51:41,715
You gave that girl her e-mail address.

1308
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:49,602
If she had read the e-mails
she would have understood everything.

1309
01:51:50,301 --> 01:51:57,155
She wouldn't have come in front of me to drink laundry liquid
She would've gone to that pharmacy in front of taht woman to do that

1310
01:51:57,163 --> 01:51:59,787
Or up there in front of you.

1311
01:51:59,833 --> 01:52:02,281
Why before me?

1312
01:52:57,303 --> 01:53:00,332
Doesn't she come here anymore?

1313
01:53:00,549 --> 01:53:01,849
Who?

1314
01:53:02,858 --> 01:53:04,258
Nama

1315
01:53:06,471 --> 01:53:07,771
No

1316
01:53:10,780 --> 01:53:12,180
Why?

1317
01:53:14,599 --> 01:53:17,792
She had done something bad.

1318
01:53:20,784 --> 01:53:22,868
She said she is sorry.

1319
01:53:26,849 --> 01:53:30,662
Somethings couldn't be forgiven.

1320
01:53:30,881 --> 01:53:32,201
Like what?

1321
01:53:36,997 --> 01:53:38,350
What has happened to your finger?

1322
01:53:38,421 --> 01:53:39,421
Nothing.

1323
01:53:44,309 --> 01:53:46,878
I want to get back to Lea

1324
01:53:48,928 --> 01:53:51,193
Currently we cant

1325
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:57,499
Till when?

1326
01:54:04,240 --> 01:54:06,749
Until your mother's situation becomes clear.

1327
01:54:06,779 --> 01:54:07,763
When it becomes clear?

1328
01:54:07,779 --> 01:54:08,923
I dont know.

1329
01:54:13,990 --> 01:54:16,631
I get bored here.

1330
01:54:20,010 --> 01:54:23,079
Why don't you come down with me?

1331
01:54:25,289 --> 01:54:26,882
I don't like it down there.

1332
01:55:26,902 --> 01:55:28,102
Hello

1333
01:55:28,132 --> 01:55:29,532
Hello

1334
01:55:29,868 --> 01:55:31,101
Go up for a moment Fouad.

1335
01:55:31,108 --> 01:55:32,508
How are you?

1336
01:55:33,505 --> 01:55:36,070
Can I go with Marie then?

1337
01:55:38,796 --> 01:55:40,361
Go and get your stuff.

1338
01:55:41,103 --> 01:55:42,203
Go.

1339
01:55:49,492 --> 01:55:51,529
Would you draw something for mom?

1340
01:55:51,591 --> 01:55:52,791
Ok.

1341
01:56:15,861 --> 01:56:17,361
Sit down.

1342
01:56:31,826 --> 01:56:34,071
You think she read those e-mails?

1343
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:39,140
I don't know.

1344
01:56:39,148 --> 01:56:41,189
If she had read them...

1345
01:56:42,633 --> 01:56:46,410
She would've told you something about it.

1346
01:56:46,490 --> 01:56:53,285
We didn't talk to each other after that fight.
She went into a sulk with me.

1347
01:56:54,598 --> 01:57:02,584
Even if she had read them...
 it wasn't impportant for her

1348
01:57:08,441 --> 01:57:10,457
Was it important?

1349
01:57:13,716 --> 01:57:14,816
Maybe

1350
01:57:15,487 --> 01:57:22,298
I don't know...Now I want to talk about the present
The past is gone

1351
01:57:22,672 --> 01:57:25,669
What I know now is that you're pregnant

1352
01:57:25,699 --> 01:57:27,628
We have to forget it

1353
01:57:28,717 --> 01:57:29,917
Could we?

1354
01:57:30,666 --> 01:57:31,814
We have to

1355
01:57:36,888 --> 01:57:38,932
What if we don't?

1356
01:57:58,365 --> 01:58:00,213
Is your hand better?

1357
01:58:00,331 --> 01:58:02,387
It still hurts a little.

1358
01:58:03,076 --> 01:58:04,496
Didn't you go to doctor?

1359
01:58:05,147 --> 01:58:08,893
Lack of calcium, The baby takes it all.

1360
01:58:09,229 --> 01:58:11,281
How many months?

1361
01:58:14,101 --> 01:58:15,757
About three

1362
01:58:17,061 --> 01:58:21,042
I thought your wrist hurt because of painting.

1363
01:58:22,949 --> 01:58:24,293
Don't know.

1364
01:58:25,169 --> 01:58:26,469
Maybe.

1365
01:58:46,099 --> 01:58:49,651
There's something I want to tell you before I go.

1366
01:58:52,927 --> 01:58:54,476
About what?

1367
01:59:01,801 --> 01:59:03,298
When I left...

1368
01:59:07,332 --> 01:59:08,716
It's not important

1369
01:59:13,074 --> 01:59:14,479
I wanted to make it clear

1370
01:59:14,499 --> 01:59:15,799
No.

1371
01:59:19,342 --> 01:59:22,179
I don't want to get back to the past

1372
01:59:22,788 --> 01:59:24,200
Forget it.

1373
01:59:38,741 --> 01:59:40,121
So I go.

1374
01:59:40,334 --> 01:59:42,268
What about your stuff in store?

1375
01:59:44,189 --> 01:59:45,437
I don't want them

1376
01:59:47,699 --> 01:59:48,899
Take them.

1377
01:59:59,205 --> 02:00:00,366
What are you doing?

1378
02:00:00,404 --> 02:00:02,877
My helicopter got stuck

1379
02:00:05,147 --> 02:00:08,803
You broke it!

1380
02:00:08,862 --> 02:00:10,382
No, It just stuck

1381
02:00:14,246 --> 02:00:15,158
Did you reach it?

1382
02:00:15,197 --> 02:00:16,577
Wait...Wait

1383
02:00:17,127 --> 02:00:18,439
Be careful

1384
02:00:25,392 --> 02:00:26,740
You're going?

1385
02:00:27,383 --> 02:00:28,767
Yeah I'm going

1386
02:00:29,310 --> 02:00:30,762
Bye Fouad

1387
02:00:30,854 --> 02:00:31,954
Bye

1388
02:00:43,304 --> 02:00:44,404
Bye

1389
02:01:37,378 --> 02:01:40,707
Unfortunately she has no reaction.

1390
02:01:41,681 --> 02:01:42,681
Nothing?

1391
02:01:42,697 --> 02:01:44,381
I saw nothing.

1392
02:01:45,594 --> 02:01:49,460
You mean both time that she
clawed at her stomach were involuntary

1393
02:01:49,545 --> 02:01:56,439
Maybe, this test doesn't help us
to know how much conscience she is

1394
02:01:56,953 --> 02:01:59,438
But she had never clawed at her stomach before.

1395
02:01:59,449 --> 02:02:04,756
I can't tell, Maybe it has happened when
the nurse was trying to move her

1396
02:02:04,774 --> 02:02:06,639
Their skin is so sensitive.

1397
02:02:09,089 --> 02:02:10,737
Sorry doctor

1398
02:02:10,759 --> 02:02:13,336
How can I make sure that she has not clawed herself?

1399
02:02:13,404 --> 02:02:19,370
Through next tests. However, If they're
negative there will be still some doubts

1400
02:02:19,449 --> 02:02:21,858
In this situation every cetainty is dobious

1401
02:02:36,559 --> 02:02:39,528
I put the perfumes next to her bed.

1402
02:02:41,037 --> 02:02:44,014
Sorry, Did you test all of them?

1403
02:02:44,102 --> 02:02:45,963
No just one or two.

1404
02:03:08,885 --> 02:03:09,985
Bye.

1405
02:06:49,162 --> 02:06:53,562
If you can smell it Cline, squeeze my finger.

1406
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:59,094
