1
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,179
Kissing it all good-bye.
These four stinkin' walls,

2
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,381
six flights up,

3
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:40,180
six flights up,

4
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:42,221
the el that roars by at 3 a.m.

5
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:44,182
Like a cast-iron wind.

6
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:45,742
Kiss 'em good-bye for me, Maury.

7
00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:48,182
I'll miss 'em...
like hell I will.

8
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:49,261
Dreamin' again.

9
00:01:49,262 --> 00:01:51,544
Not anymore, Lil.
I'm awake now,

10
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:54,585
awake for the first time in years.

11
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:56,025
Uncle Dave said it...

12
00:01:56,105 --> 00:01:57,465
"Daylight is a dream

13
00:01:57,505 --> 00:01:59,985
if you live with your eyes closed."

14
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:02,906
Well, my eyes are open now.
I see the choir.

15
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:04,947
I know they're dressed in rags,

16
00:02:05,027 --> 00:02:07,107
but we're part of that choir.

17
00:02:07,188 --> 00:02:08,468
Yeah, both of us,

18
00:02:08,548 --> 00:02:10,708
and you, Maury, and Uncle Dave.

19
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,149
Sun's comin' up, kid.

20
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:13,869
They'll be hawkin' the fish

21
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,310
down on Fulton Street.

22
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,750
Let 'em hawk.

23
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:18,831
Let 'em sing their hearts out.

24
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,111
That's it, kid.

25
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:22,512
Take that ruined choir.
Make it sing.

26
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,872
So long, Maury.

27
00:02:23,952 --> 00:02:25,352
So long.

28
00:02:27,553 --> 00:02:29,233
We'll hear from that kid,

29
00:02:29,314 --> 00:02:31,954
and I don't mean a postcard.

30
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:34,195
Fish!

31
00:02:34,274 --> 00:02:36,355
Fresh fish!

32
00:02:38,596 --> 00:02:41,396
Let's spit on our hands
and get to work.

33
00:02:41,477 --> 00:02:42,837
It's late, Maury.

34
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:44,277
Not anymore, Lil.

35
00:02:44,358 --> 00:02:45,638
It's early.

36
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,801
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

37
00:02:59,602 --> 00:03:00,642
Bravo!

38
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:02,562
Bravo!

39
00:03:02,602 --> 00:03:04,123
Bravo!

40
00:03:05,483 --> 00:03:07,684
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

41
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,766
- Author!
- Author!

42
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:18,967
- Author!
- Author!

43
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:20,527
- Author!
- Author!

44
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:23,088
- Author!
- Author!

45
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:25,848
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

46
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:39,132
Your table is ready, Monsieur Fink.

47
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:42,493
In fact, several members of your party
have already arrived.

48
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:43,934
Is Garland Stanford here?

49
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:46,854
He called to say
he'd be a few minutes late.

50
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:48,735
Ah, here we are.

51
00:03:48,815 --> 00:03:51,655
Barton!
Barton, so glad you could make it.

52
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:53,536
You know Richard St. Claire

53
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:55,136
and Poppy Carnahan.

54
00:03:55,216 --> 00:03:57,297
Charmed, charmed, charmed.

55
00:03:57,377 --> 00:03:59,817
We're drinking champagne
in honor of the occasion.

56
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:01,938
Have you seen the Herald?

57
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:03,099
Not yet.

58
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:04,419
I won't embarrass you,

59
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:06,499
but Caven could
hardly contain himself.

60
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,619
More important,

61
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,820
Richard and Poppy here loved the play.

62
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,941
Weeping.

63
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,980
Copious tears.

64
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:14,021
What did the Herald say?

65
00:04:14,102 --> 00:04:15,380
I happen to have it.

66
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:16,381
Please, Derek...

67
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,782
"Bare Ruined Choirs:

68
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:20,223
Triumph of the Common Man.

69
00:04:20,263 --> 00:04:22,383
The star of Bare Ruined Choirs

70
00:04:22,464 --> 00:04:24,664
was nowhere seen
on the stage last night,

71
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:26,984
though the thespians
acquitted themselves admirably.

72
00:04:26,985 --> 00:04:28,666
The find of the evening

73
00:04:28,745 --> 00:04:31,586
was the author of this drama
about simple folk,

74
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,027
fishmongers, in fact,

75
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:34,747
whose brute struggle for existence

76
00:04:34,787 --> 00:04:37,308
cannot quite quell their longing
for something higher.

77
00:04:37,388 --> 00:04:38,788
The playwright finds nobility

78
00:04:38,828 --> 00:04:40,548
in the most squalid corners

79
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:43,149
and poetry in the most callous speech.

80
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:46,109
A tough new voice
in the American theater has arrived,

81
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,551
and the owner of that voice is named...

82
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,471
Barton Fink."

83
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:54,112
They'll be wrapping fish in it
in the morning.

84
00:04:54,152 --> 00:04:55,872
Cynic.

85
00:04:55,953 --> 00:04:58,473
I can't start listening to the critics,

86
00:04:58,553 --> 00:05:01,354
and I can't kid myself
about my own work.

87
00:05:01,394 --> 00:05:03,274
A writer writes from his gut.

88
00:05:03,314 --> 00:05:06,155
His gut tells him
what's good and what's...

89
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:08,075
merely adequate.

90
00:05:09,236 --> 00:05:12,077
I don't pretend to be a critic,

91
00:05:12,117 --> 00:05:14,557
but Lord knows I have a gut,

92
00:05:14,638 --> 00:05:17,958
and my gut tells me it's simply...

93
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:20,039
marvelous.

94
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,320
And a charming gut it is.

95
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,160
Oh, you dog.

96
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:26,200
Aroo!

97
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:27,561
Oh, stop.

98
00:05:32,802 --> 00:05:35,603
I thought you were going to join us.

99
00:05:35,643 --> 00:05:38,604
Jesus, Garland,
you left me alone with those people?

100
00:05:38,644 --> 00:05:39,763
Don't panic.

101
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:41,805
I'll join you in a minute.

102
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:44,325
We have to talk a little business.

103
00:05:44,406 --> 00:05:47,206
I've just been on the phone
to Los Angeles.

104
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:50,087
Barton, Capitol Pictures wants to
put you under contract.

105
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:52,488
They've offered you $1,000 a week.

106
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:55,369
I think I can get them
to go as high as 2.

107
00:05:55,448 --> 00:05:56,728
To do what?

108
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:58,849
What do you do for a living?

109
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,650
I'm not sure anymore.

110
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,971
I guess I try to make a difference.

111
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,971
There's no pressure here
because I respect you,

112
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:09,172
but a brief tenure in Hollywood

113
00:06:09,212 --> 00:06:11,332
could support you through the writing

114
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,094
of any number of plays.

115
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,533
I don't know, Garland.

116
00:06:14,613 --> 00:06:16,734
My place is here right now.

117
00:06:16,814 --> 00:06:19,455
I feel I'm on the brink of success.

118
00:06:19,535 --> 00:06:21,736
I'd say you're already enjoying some.

119
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,336
No. Don't you see?

120
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,176
Not the kind of success
where critics fawn over you

121
00:06:26,257 --> 00:06:28,897
or producers like Derek
make a lot of money.

122
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:30,698
No. A real success.

123
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:32,738
The success we've been dreaming about...

124
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,619
the creation of a new living theater

125
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:38,580
of and about and for the common man.

126
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,021
If I ran off to Hollywood now,

127
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:42,421
I'd be making money,

128
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:44,261
going to parties,
meeting the big shots,

129
00:06:44,342 --> 00:06:46,021
but I'd be cutting myself off

130
00:06:46,102 --> 00:06:48,303
from the wellspring of that success,

131
00:06:48,382 --> 00:06:49,903
from the common man.

132
00:06:51,943 --> 00:06:55,585
Oh, I guess I'm spouting off again.

133
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,305
You see Caven's review?

134
00:06:57,385 --> 00:06:58,985
No. What did it say?

135
00:06:59,065 --> 00:07:00,466
Here, take my copy.

136
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:02,306
You're the toast of Broadway,

137
00:07:02,347 --> 00:07:04,067
and you have an opportunity

138
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:07,388
to redeem that for a little cash...

139
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:09,628
Strike that.
A lot of cash.

140
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:14,469
The common man will still be here
when you get back.

141
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,910
Who knows?

142
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,271
They may even have one or two of them
out in Hollywood.

143
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:21,831
That's a rationalization, Garland.

144
00:07:21,912 --> 00:07:26,073
Barton, it was a joke.

145
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:50,495
Welcome to Hotel Earle.
May I help you?

146
00:08:50,535 --> 00:08:51,936
I'm checking in.

147
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:53,215
Barton Fink.

148
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:55,777
All righty.

149
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,297
Okay...

150
00:08:59,378 --> 00:09:01,538
F-I-N-K?

151
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:05,298
"Fink, Barton."

152
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:06,699
That must be you, huh?

153
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:07,779
Must be.

154
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,261
Okay, then everything
seems to be in order.

155
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:15,301
Everything seems to be in order.

156
00:09:15,382 --> 00:09:16,582
Just...

157
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:20,463
Are you a trans or a res?

158
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:21,584
Excuse me?

159
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,143
Transient or resident?

160
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:24,264
I...

161
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:26,225
I... I... I don't know.

162
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:28,385
I mean, I'll be here indefinitely.

163
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:31,186
Res. That's 25.50 a week
payable in advance.

164
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:32,906
Check-out time's 12:00 sharp,

165
00:09:32,987 --> 00:09:34,827
only forget that.
You're a res.

166
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,026
If you need anything,
pick up your personal in-room telephone.

167
00:09:36,027 --> 00:09:37,987
If you need anything,
pick up your personal in-room telephone.

168
00:09:37,988 --> 00:09:39,267
My name is Chet.

169
00:09:39,268 --> 00:09:40,628
Although we provide privacy

170
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:42,068
for the residential guests,

171
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,789
we're a full-service hotel,

172
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:45,109
including complimentary shoe shine.

173
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,710
My name is Chet.

174
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,391
Okay.

175
00:09:54,392 --> 00:09:56,192
Those your only bags?

176
00:09:56,273 --> 00:09:59,194
The others are being sent.

177
00:09:59,273 --> 00:10:02,194
Welcome to Los Angeles, Mr. Fink.

178
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:15,397
Six, please.

179
00:10:18,478 --> 00:10:21,479
Next stop... six.

180
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:31,402
This stop... six.

181
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:27,689
Is that him?

182
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:30,890
Is that Barton Fink?

183
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:32,290
Let me at him.

184
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,890
Let me put my arms
around this guy.

185
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:36,811
Let me hug this guy.

186
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:38,772
How the hell are ya?

187
00:13:38,812 --> 00:13:39,812
Good trip?

188
00:13:39,892 --> 00:13:41,293
My name's Jack Lipnick.

189
00:13:41,332 --> 00:13:43,133
You know that.
You read the papers.

190
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:44,854
Lou treating you all right?

191
00:13:44,933 --> 00:13:47,054
What's the matter
with your face?

192
00:13:47,134 --> 00:13:49,375
What's the matter
with his face, Lou?

193
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,775
It's not so bad.

194
00:13:50,855 --> 00:13:52,775
A mosquito in my room.

195
00:13:52,855 --> 00:13:54,094
Where'd we put him?

196
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:55,416
I'm at the Earle.

197
00:13:55,496 --> 00:13:57,817
Never heard of it.
Let's move him.

198
00:13:57,897 --> 00:13:59,176
Stay at my place.

199
00:13:59,177 --> 00:14:00,697
I wanted a place a little less...

200
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:03,178
Less Hollywood. Say it.
It's not a dirty word.

201
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,218
Say whatever you want.

202
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:07,739
The writer is king
at Capitol Pictures.

203
00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:09,020
Look at your paycheck.

204
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,100
That's what
we think of writers.

205
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,981
So, what kind of pictures
does he like?

206
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,582
Mr. Fink hasn't given
a preference, Mr. Lipnick.

207
00:14:16,662 --> 00:14:18,662
So, how about it, Bart?

208
00:14:18,743 --> 00:14:20,583
Well, uh, to be honest,

209
00:14:20,663 --> 00:14:23,264
I don't go to the pictures much.

210
00:14:23,343 --> 00:14:24,383
That's okay.

211
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:26,025
You probably
walked in here

212
00:14:26,104 --> 00:14:28,545
thinking that was going
to be a handicap,

213
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:31,425
thinking we wanted people
who knew something about the medium,

214
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:33,945
thinking there's technical
mumbo jumbo to learn.

215
00:14:33,946 --> 00:14:35,427
You were dead wrong.

216
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,588
There's only one thing...
Can you tell a story?

217
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,788
Can you make us laugh,
make us cry,

218
00:14:40,868 --> 00:14:43,309
make us want
to break out in song?

219
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:44,709
That more than one thing?

220
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:47,670
I run this dump, and I don't know
technical mumbo jumbo.

221
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,270
Why do I run it?

222
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:51,711
'Cause I got horse sense, showmanship!

223
00:14:51,751 --> 00:14:54,432
And also I'm bigger
and meaner and louder

224
00:14:54,472 --> 00:14:56,753
than any other kike
in this town.

225
00:14:56,832 --> 00:14:59,193
I don't mean my dick's
bigger than yours.

226
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,593
It's not a sexual thing.
Coffee?

227
00:15:04,074 --> 00:15:05,475
Yes, thank you.

228
00:15:05,555 --> 00:15:06,475
Lou!

229
00:15:13,677 --> 00:15:16,478
Used to have shares
in the company,

230
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:17,637
ownership interest,

231
00:15:17,638 --> 00:15:20,118
got bought out...
muscled out.

232
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:22,999
We keep him around.
He's got a family.

233
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,359
Poor schmuck.
He's sensitive.

234
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,640
Don't mention the old days.
Hell, say whatever you want.

235
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:28,041
Look, barring a preference,

236
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,922
you'll be working on
a wrestling picture... Wallace Beery.

237
00:15:30,961 --> 00:15:33,803
They say you know
the poetry of the street.

238
00:15:33,882 --> 00:15:35,643
That rules out
westerns, pirates,

239
00:15:35,723 --> 00:15:37,483
screwball, Bible, Roman...

240
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:39,964
I'm not some guy
that thinks poetic is fruity.

241
00:15:40,044 --> 00:15:41,404
We're together on that.

242
00:15:41,485 --> 00:15:43,325
I'm from New York myself.

243
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:46,246
Minsk... if you want
to go all the way back,

244
00:15:46,286 --> 00:15:48,806
which we won't
if you don't mind.

245
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:50,527
People will say to you...

246
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:53,128
Wallace Beery, wrestling...
it's a B picture.

247
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:54,528
You tell them... bullshit!

248
00:15:54,608 --> 00:15:57,649
We don't make B pictures
here at Capitol.

249
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:00,889
Let's put a stop
to that rumor right now.

250
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:05,650
Thanks, Lou.

251
00:16:05,651 --> 00:16:07,051
Join us.
Join us.

252
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:09,772
We're talking about
the Wally Beery picture.

253
00:16:09,812 --> 00:16:11,413
Excellent picture.

254
00:16:11,452 --> 00:16:13,653
Got a treatment on it yet?

255
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:15,333
We just bought the story.

256
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:16,814
Saturday Evening Post.

257
00:16:16,854 --> 00:16:18,214
The hell with the story.

258
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:19,495
Wally Beery's a wrestler.

259
00:16:19,574 --> 00:16:21,775
Give me his hopes, his dreams.

260
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,616
Naturally he gets mixed up
with a bad element

261
00:16:24,696 --> 00:16:27,417
and a romantic interest
or else an orphan.

262
00:16:27,496 --> 00:16:31,018
Lou, think Wally's too old
for a romantic interest?

263
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:35,178
Look at me.

264
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:37,139
A writer in the room,

265
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:39,780
and I'm asking Lou
about the goddamn story.

266
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,181
Which is it, Bart?

267
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,621
Orphan?
Dame?

268
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:48,102
Both maybe?

269
00:16:51,983 --> 00:16:54,424
Maybe we should do a treatment.

270
00:16:54,503 --> 00:16:57,024
Hell!
Let Bart take a crack at it.

271
00:16:57,105 --> 00:16:59,465
He'll get into the swing of things

272
00:16:59,545 --> 00:17:01,346
or I don't know writers.

273
00:17:01,426 --> 00:17:03,906
Let's make it a dame.
Keep it simple.

274
00:17:03,986 --> 00:17:05,346
The important thing

275
00:17:05,427 --> 00:17:08,227
is we all want it to have
that Barton Fink feeling.

276
00:17:08,308 --> 00:17:10,028
We all have that feeling,

277
00:17:10,108 --> 00:17:11,788
but since you're Barton Fink,

278
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:13,989
I'm assuming you have it in spades.

279
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,309
I like you.

280
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,350
If all my writers
were like you,

281
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,270
I wouldn't have
to get involved.

282
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,151
Have something
by the end of the week.

283
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:27,352
I heard about your show,
by the way.

284
00:17:27,432 --> 00:17:30,113
My man in New York saw it.

285
00:17:30,154 --> 00:17:32,594
Says it's damn moving,
a little fruity,

286
00:17:32,674 --> 00:17:34,955
but I guess you know
what you're doing.

287
00:17:35,035 --> 00:17:36,395
Thanks for your heart.

288
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:38,756
We need more heart
in motion pictures.

289
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:40,716
We're all expecting great things.

290
00:19:55,752 --> 00:19:57,152
Front desk.

291
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:59,032
Hello? Uh, Chet?

292
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:00,153
Speaking.

293
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,994
This is Barton Fink in room 621.

294
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:07,195
Yes. There's, uh, someone in the room
next door to mine...

295
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:08,316
623...

296
00:20:08,395 --> 00:20:11,036
and he's, uh...

297
00:20:11,116 --> 00:20:12,317
he's, uh...

298
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:17,798
making a lot of... noise.

299
00:20:17,878 --> 00:20:20,519
I'll take care of it
right away, sir.

300
00:20:20,598 --> 00:20:21,759
Thank you.

301
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:34,162
Hello.

302
00:20:34,242 --> 00:20:35,962
What?

303
00:20:36,043 --> 00:20:38,003
Huh?

304
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,284
Who?

305
00:21:12,052 --> 00:21:13,773
Did you...

306
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:18,414
Somebody just complained.

307
00:21:18,494 --> 00:21:19,774
No. I didn't.

308
00:21:19,815 --> 00:21:22,175
I mean, I did call down,

309
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:23,454
not to complain exactly.

310
00:21:23,455 --> 00:21:25,456
I was concerned that you might...

311
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:27,256
not that it's my business...

312
00:21:27,337 --> 00:21:29,617
might be in some kind of... distress.

313
00:21:29,697 --> 00:21:32,818
See, I was trying to work,
and it's...

314
00:21:32,898 --> 00:21:35,019
Well, it was... difficult.

315
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,540
Yeah.

316
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,101
I'm damned sorry
if I bothered you.

317
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,541
The damn walls here...

318
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:46,461
I just apologize like hell.

319
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:47,902
My name's Charlie Meadows.

320
00:21:47,982 --> 00:21:49,702
I guess we're neighbors.

321
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:50,861
Barton Fink.

322
00:21:50,862 --> 00:21:52,223
Neighbor, I'd feel better

323
00:21:52,303 --> 00:21:53,663
about the damned inconvenience

324
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:56,144
if you let me buy you a drink.

325
00:21:58,024 --> 00:21:59,545
That's all right.
Really.

326
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:00,986
Thank you.

327
00:22:01,065 --> 00:22:02,385
All right, hell.

328
00:22:02,466 --> 00:22:03,826
You trying to work,

329
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,706
me carrying on in there.

330
00:22:05,747 --> 00:22:07,427
The liquor's good.
What do you say?

331
00:22:07,507 --> 00:22:08,827
You got a glass?

332
00:22:08,908 --> 00:22:11,588
It's the least I can do.

333
00:22:11,668 --> 00:22:13,949
Okay, a quick one.

334
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:15,829
Sure.

335
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:17,670
Yeah, just a nip.

336
00:22:18,831 --> 00:22:21,111
I sure do forget myself sometimes.

337
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,992
I feel like a heel...

338
00:22:24,032 --> 00:22:25,872
All the carryings-on next door.

339
00:22:25,992 --> 00:22:27,672
That's okay, I assure you.

340
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,433
It's just I was trying to work.

341
00:22:30,513 --> 00:22:34,234
What kind of work do you do, Barton,
if you don't mind my asking?

342
00:22:34,315 --> 00:22:36,075
Well, I'm a writer, actually.

343
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,556
You don't say?
That's a tough racket.

344
00:22:38,635 --> 00:22:40,395
My hat's off to you.

345
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:42,476
Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.

346
00:22:42,557 --> 00:22:44,117
It's not easy, but...

347
00:22:44,157 --> 00:22:46,077
Damn difficult, I'd imagine.

348
00:22:46,118 --> 00:22:48,478
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?

349
00:22:48,518 --> 00:22:50,038
Hell, no, call me Charlie.

350
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,318
Well, Barton...

351
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:54,119
you might say I sell peace of mind.

352
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,880
Insurance is my game.
Door-to-door.

353
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,201
Human contact's the only way
to move merchandise.

354
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:01,921
In spite of what you might think,
I'm pretty good at it.

355
00:23:02,002 --> 00:23:03,442
It doesn't surprise me.

356
00:23:03,522 --> 00:23:04,802
I believe in it.

357
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,963
Fire, theft, and casualty aren't things

358
00:23:07,043 --> 00:23:09,164
that only happen to other people.

359
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:10,644
Writing doesn't work out,

360
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:13,005
you may want to look into it.

361
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:15,325
Providing basic needs...
you could do worse.

362
00:23:15,365 --> 00:23:17,285
I'll keep that in mind.

363
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:19,526
What kind of scribbler are you?

364
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,406
Newspaperman did you say?

365
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:24,167
No. Actually, I'm writing
for the pictures now.

366
00:23:24,248 --> 00:23:25,448
Pictures?

367
00:23:25,527 --> 00:23:26,928
Jesus!

368
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,850
Aw, I'm sorry, brother.

369
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:33,090
I was just sitting here thinking

370
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,451
I was talking to some ambitious
youngster eager to make good.

371
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:38,331
Hell, you've got it made.

372
00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:40,372
Beating out that competition?

373
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,852
And me being patronizing?

374
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:46,894
Is the egg showing or what?

375
00:23:46,973 --> 00:23:49,614
Actually, I'm just starting out
in the movies,

376
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,495
though I was well established
in New York,

377
00:23:52,575 --> 00:23:54,215
some renown there.

378
00:23:54,255 --> 00:23:56,576
Oh, it's an exciting time, then.

379
00:23:56,657 --> 00:23:59,097
I'm not the best-read mug on the planet,

380
00:23:59,177 --> 00:24:02,338
so it's not surprising
I didn't recognize your name.

381
00:24:02,418 --> 00:24:04,739
Jesus, I feel like a heel.

382
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,539
That's okay, Charlie.
I'm a playwright.

383
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:09,859
My shows have only played New York.

384
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,260
The last one got
a hell of a write-up.

385
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,221
Must be why they wanted me.

386
00:24:14,261 --> 00:24:16,061
Why not?
Everyone wants quality.

387
00:24:16,142 --> 00:24:20,343
What kind of venue...
that is to say,

388
00:24:20,422 --> 00:24:21,782
thematically,

389
00:24:21,863 --> 00:24:23,583
um...

390
00:24:23,664 --> 00:24:25,464
What do I write about?

391
00:24:26,864 --> 00:24:29,184
Caught me trying to be fancy.

392
00:24:29,265 --> 00:24:30,666
Yeah, that's it, Bart.

393
00:24:30,745 --> 00:24:32,505
Well, that's a good question.

394
00:24:32,586 --> 00:24:34,907
Strange as it may seem, Charlie,

395
00:24:34,986 --> 00:24:37,387
I write about people like you...

396
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:39,548
the working stiff,
the common man.

397
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:41,828
Well, ain't that
a kick in the head.

398
00:24:41,908 --> 00:24:44,548
I guess it is, but in a way,

399
00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:45,949
that's exactly the point.

400
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,510
There's a few people in New York...

401
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,230
hopefully our numbers are growing...

402
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:52,391
who feel we have an opportunity

403
00:24:52,471 --> 00:24:55,752
to forge something real
out of everyday experience,

404
00:24:55,832 --> 00:24:58,152
create a theater for the masses

405
00:24:58,233 --> 00:25:00,393
based on a few simple truths,

406
00:25:00,473 --> 00:25:02,953
not on some shopworn abstractions
about drama

407
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:05,314
that don't hold true today.

408
00:25:05,395 --> 00:25:07,996
I don't guess this means much to you.

409
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:10,235
Hell, I could tell you stories.

410
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:12,996
And that's the point...
we all have stories.

411
00:25:13,077 --> 00:25:16,358
The hopes and dreams
of the common man

412
00:25:16,397 --> 00:25:19,038
are as noble as those of any king.

413
00:25:19,078 --> 00:25:20,479
The stuff of life...

414
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:23,039
Why shouldn't it be
the stuff of theater?

415
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:25,920
Why should that be
such a hard pill to swallow?

416
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,161
Don't call it new theater, Charlie.

417
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,601
Call it real theater.

418
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:31,442
Call it our theater!

419
00:25:31,521 --> 00:25:34,762
I can see you feel
pretty strongly about it.

420
00:25:34,842 --> 00:25:37,643
I don't mean to get up
on my high horse,

421
00:25:37,723 --> 00:25:40,523
but why shouldn't we
look at ourselves up there?

422
00:25:40,604 --> 00:25:43,044
Who cares about
the fifth Earl of Bastrop

423
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:44,525
and Lady Higginbottom

424
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:45,925
and...

425
00:25:45,965 --> 00:25:48,406
and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?

426
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:50,326
My butt's getting sore already.

427
00:25:50,406 --> 00:25:52,647
Exactly.
You understand what I'm saying

428
00:25:52,687 --> 00:25:55,207
a lot more than some
of these literary types

429
00:25:55,248 --> 00:25:56,808
because you're a real man.

430
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:59,529
I could tell you some stories...

431
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:00,929
Sure, you could,

432
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:03,690
yet many writers insulate themselves
from the common man,

433
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,731
from where they live,

434
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,051
from where they trade
and fight and love

435
00:26:08,092 --> 00:26:09,491
and converse and...

436
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:10,892
and...

437
00:26:12,252 --> 00:26:14,133
So, naturally, their work suffers

438
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:16,493
and regresses into
empty formalism and...

439
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,414
Well, I'm spouting off again,

440
00:26:18,454 --> 00:26:20,894
but to put it in your language...

441
00:26:20,975 --> 00:26:23,176
the theater becomes
as phony as a $3 bill.

442
00:26:23,255 --> 00:26:25,255
That's a tragedy right there.

443
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:28,816
You're all right, Charlie.

444
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:31,418
I'm glad you stopped by.

445
00:26:31,497 --> 00:26:33,298
I know sometimes I run on.

446
00:26:33,338 --> 00:26:36,459
Well, Christ, if there's
any way I can contribute

447
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:37,778
or help or whatever...

448
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:39,979
You can help by just being yourself.

449
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,901
Well, I can tell you some stories.

450
00:26:42,941 --> 00:26:44,020
Now, look...

451
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:45,901
I'm sorry about
the interruption.

452
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:48,301
Too much revelry late at night,

453
00:26:48,382 --> 00:26:51,303
you forget there's other people
in the world.

454
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,409
I'll be eating on the lot today.

455
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:31,449
Who's this?

456
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,770
Barton Fink, Mr. Geezler.

457
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:33,690
Geisler.

458
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:35,210
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler.

459
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:36,811
Ted Okum said to drop by.

460
00:28:36,891 --> 00:28:37,811
Ever act?

461
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:39,131
Huh? No. I'm a...

462
00:28:39,132 --> 00:28:41,491
We need Indians
for a Norman Steele western.

463
00:28:41,532 --> 00:28:42,651
I'm a writer.

464
00:28:42,652 --> 00:28:45,213
Writers come and go.
We always need Indians.

465
00:28:45,293 --> 00:28:46,572
I'm a writer.

466
00:28:46,573 --> 00:28:49,374
Ted Okum said you're producing
this Wallace Beery picture.

467
00:28:49,414 --> 00:28:50,734
Ted Okum doesn't know shit.

468
00:28:50,815 --> 00:28:53,214
They've assigned me
enough pictures for a year.

469
00:28:53,215 --> 00:28:54,656
What Ted Okum doesn't know

470
00:28:54,695 --> 00:28:57,055
you could almost squeeze
into the Hollywood Bowl.

471
00:28:57,056 --> 00:28:58,617
Who should I talk to?

472
00:29:01,098 --> 00:29:02,938
Get me Lou Breeze.

473
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:05,738
Mr. Breeze's office.

474
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:07,459
Is he in for Mr. Geezler?

475
00:29:07,499 --> 00:29:08,539
Geisler.

476
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:11,380
Lou! How's Lipnick's ass
smell this morning?

477
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,500
Yeah? Yeah?

478
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:14,820
Yeah. All right.
Listen.

479
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:17,181
I got a writer here...
Fink... all screwy.

480
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:19,622
Says I'm producing
that Wallace Beery wrestling picture.

481
00:29:19,623 --> 00:29:21,182
What am I, the goddamn janitor?

482
00:29:21,223 --> 00:29:23,583
Yeah?
Who'd you get that from?

483
00:29:23,623 --> 00:29:26,144
Well, tell Lipnick
he can kiss my dimpled ass.

484
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,744
No, no. All right. Shit.

485
00:29:27,824 --> 00:29:29,505
All right. No.
All right.

486
00:29:31,305 --> 00:29:32,986
Okay, Fink.

487
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:34,346
Let's chow.

488
00:29:40,268 --> 00:29:41,508
Don't worry about it.

489
00:29:41,548 --> 00:29:42,949
It's just a B picture.

490
00:29:42,988 --> 00:29:44,789
I bring it in on budget,

491
00:29:44,869 --> 00:29:46,669
they book it without screening it.

492
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:49,270
Lipnick said he wanted
to look at the script

493
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,031
by the end of the week.

494
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,390
Sure, he did.

495
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,630
He forgot about it
before your ass left his sofa.

496
00:29:54,631 --> 00:29:55,791
He forgot about it
before your ass left his sofa.

497
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:56,952
Okay.

498
00:29:59,473 --> 00:30:01,714
I'm just having trouble
getting started.

499
00:30:01,753 --> 00:30:03,273
It's funny.
I'm blocked up.

500
00:30:03,354 --> 00:30:04,594
I just feel

501
00:30:04,674 --> 00:30:06,834
like I need
some kind of indication

502
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:08,275
of what's expected.

503
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:10,915
Wallace Beery.
Wrestling picture.

504
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:12,876
What do you need, a road map?

505
00:30:12,956 --> 00:30:14,437
Look,

506
00:30:14,516 --> 00:30:15,717
you're confused.

507
00:30:15,797 --> 00:30:17,277
You need guidance?

508
00:30:19,118 --> 00:30:20,399
Talk to another writer.

509
00:30:20,438 --> 00:30:21,798
Who?

510
00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:23,039
Oh, Jesus.

511
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,160
You throw a rock in here,
you'll hit one.

512
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,520
Do me a favor, Fink...

513
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:30,041
Throw it hard.

514
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:47,502
Bill Mayhew.
Sorry about the odor.

515
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:49,222
Barton Fink.

516
00:31:54,104 --> 00:31:56,144
Jesus. W.P.?

517
00:31:57,064 --> 00:31:58,303
I beg your pardon?

518
00:31:58,304 --> 00:32:00,304
W.P. Mayhew?
The writer?

519
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,746
Just Bill, please.

520
00:32:02,826 --> 00:32:04,826
Bill!

521
00:32:04,906 --> 00:32:07,026
You're the finest novelist
of our time.

522
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:08,827
Why, thank you, son.
How kind.

523
00:32:08,907 --> 00:32:09,947
My God.

524
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:13,549
I had no idea
you were in Hollywood.

525
00:32:13,589 --> 00:32:15,429
All of us undomesticated writers

526
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:17,349
eventually make our way out here

527
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,270
to the great salt lick.

528
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,711
That's probably why

529
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,591
I always have
such a powerful thirst.

530
00:32:23,671 --> 00:32:25,992
A little social lubricant, Mr. Fink?

531
00:32:26,072 --> 00:32:27,952
No. It's a little early for me.

532
00:32:33,274 --> 00:32:34,714
Bill...

533
00:32:34,754 --> 00:32:37,915
if I'm imposing,
you should say so.

534
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:39,516
I know you're very busy.

535
00:32:39,595 --> 00:32:43,316
I just wanted to ask...
you a favor.

536
00:32:43,357 --> 00:32:47,157
Have you ever written
a wrestling picture?

537
00:32:50,078 --> 00:32:52,318
You are drippin', sir.

538
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:55,879
They have not invented
a genre of picture

539
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,200
that Bill Mayhew has not
at one time or other

540
00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:00,480
been invited to assay.

541
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:03,041
Yes, I've taken my stab
at the wrestling form,

542
00:33:03,122 --> 00:33:05,443
as I have stabbed
at so many others.

543
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:06,722
Well, how do you...

544
00:33:06,803 --> 00:33:08,603
I gather you're a freshman here,

545
00:33:08,643 --> 00:33:10,403
eager for an upperclassman's counsel.

546
00:33:10,443 --> 00:33:11,964
However, just at the moment

547
00:33:12,004 --> 00:33:13,405
I have drinking to do.

548
00:33:13,444 --> 00:33:16,085
Why don't you stop
by my bungalow, number 15,

549
00:33:16,165 --> 00:33:17,404
later on this afternoon?

550
00:33:17,405 --> 00:33:19,086
We will discuss wrestling scenarios

551
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,166
and other things literary.

552
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:24,086
Sons of bitches!

553
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:25,647
Sons of bitches!

554
00:33:26,568 --> 00:33:28,408
Where's honey?

555
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:29,809
Huh?

556
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,810
Honey!

557
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,411
Where's my honey?

558
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:39,651
The water's lapping up on me, honey!

559
00:33:39,691 --> 00:33:41,052
Honey, just stop it.

560
00:33:44,653 --> 00:33:47,173
I can't.
I'm trying to help you.

561
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:48,894
Ohh!

562
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:50,534
Can I help you?

563
00:33:50,575 --> 00:33:51,774
I'm sorry. I...

564
00:33:51,775 --> 00:33:53,175
Where are you, damn it?

565
00:33:53,255 --> 00:33:54,575
My name is Fink.

566
00:33:54,655 --> 00:33:57,016
Bill asked me to drop by
this afternoon.

567
00:33:57,096 --> 00:33:58,376
Is he, uh...

568
00:33:58,376 --> 00:33:59,217
Honey!

569
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,216
In?

570
00:34:00,297 --> 00:34:01,857
Oooh!

571
00:34:01,937 --> 00:34:04,057
Mr. Mayhew is indisposed
at the moment.

572
00:34:04,138 --> 00:34:05,698
Where's my honey?

573
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:06,937
Is he, uh...

574
00:34:06,938 --> 00:34:07,819
Honey!

575
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:09,259
Is he okay?

576
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:10,980
He'll be fine.

577
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,981
Mr. Fink, I'm Audrey Taylor,

578
00:34:15,061 --> 00:34:16,741
Mr. Mayhew's personal secretary.

579
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,022
Where's my honey?

580
00:34:18,101 --> 00:34:21,423
I know this all must sound horrid.

581
00:34:21,463 --> 00:34:22,823
I really do apologize.

582
00:34:22,903 --> 00:34:25,183
Where are you, damn it?

583
00:34:26,104 --> 00:34:28,424
When he can't write, he drinks.

584
00:34:28,504 --> 00:34:30,545
It's so embarrassing.

585
00:34:30,585 --> 00:34:33,825
How about you?
Will you be all right?

586
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:36,547
I'll be fine.

587
00:34:37,587 --> 00:34:39,467
Are you a writer, Mr. Fink?

588
00:34:39,548 --> 00:34:41,348
Yes. I'm working on a wrestling...

589
00:34:41,428 --> 00:34:42,948
Please call me Barton.

590
00:34:43,868 --> 00:34:45,709
I'll tell Bill you dropped by.

591
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:48,189
I'm sure he'll want to reschedule
your appointment.

592
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,911
Perhaps you and I can get together
at some point also.

593
00:34:51,991 --> 00:34:53,671
Sorry if that sounds abrupt.

594
00:34:53,751 --> 00:34:54,951
I just...

595
00:34:55,031 --> 00:34:58,272
I... I don't know anyone here in town.

596
00:35:00,273 --> 00:35:02,874
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.

597
00:35:02,913 --> 00:35:04,914
Please. Barton.

598
00:35:04,994 --> 00:35:06,875
Barton.

599
00:35:06,914 --> 00:35:09,715
You see, Barton,

600
00:35:09,795 --> 00:35:11,955
I'm not just Bill's secretary.

601
00:35:12,036 --> 00:35:14,036
Bill and I are...

602
00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:17,317
in love.

603
00:35:19,078 --> 00:35:20,958
Where's my honey?

604
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:23,319
Look, I know this must look...

605
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,480
Funny.

606
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,960
Bastard-ass sons of bitches!

607
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,520
I'm sorry.

608
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:31,921
Please don't judge us, Mr. Fink.

609
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:33,361
Where's that woman?

610
00:35:33,442 --> 00:35:35,282
Bastard-ass sons of bitches!

611
00:35:35,362 --> 00:35:37,723
The water's lapping up!

612
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,644
Oh, honey!

613
00:36:08,371 --> 00:36:10,532
Oh...

614
00:36:10,611 --> 00:36:11,972
Oh...

615
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:15,973
Oh...

616
00:36:16,053 --> 00:36:17,733
Oh...

617
00:36:20,534 --> 00:36:22,894
Ah...

618
00:36:22,935 --> 00:36:25,135
Oh...

619
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:30,456
Oh...

620
00:36:31,737 --> 00:36:33,418
Oh...

621
00:36:48,181 --> 00:36:49,462
Ah...

622
00:37:05,546 --> 00:37:06,826
Howdy, neighbor.

623
00:37:06,907 --> 00:37:09,227
Charlie. How are you?

624
00:37:09,307 --> 00:37:12,588
Oh, Jesus, I hope
I'm not interrupting you again.

625
00:37:12,668 --> 00:37:14,869
Heard you walking around in here.

626
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:16,269
Figured I'd drop by.

627
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:18,670
Yeah. Come on in.
Have a seat.

628
00:37:18,749 --> 00:37:21,230
I haven't really gotten started yet.

629
00:37:21,311 --> 00:37:23,270
What happened to your ear?

630
00:37:23,351 --> 00:37:25,071
Oh, yeah.
An ear infection.

631
00:37:25,152 --> 00:37:26,231
Chronic thing.

632
00:37:26,232 --> 00:37:28,873
Goes away for a while,
then it comes back.

633
00:37:28,952 --> 00:37:31,873
I got cotton in it
to staunch the pus.

634
00:37:31,993 --> 00:37:33,192
Don't worry.
It's not contagious.

635
00:37:33,193 --> 00:37:34,594
You seen a doctor?

636
00:37:34,634 --> 00:37:36,194
What's he going to tell me?

637
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:38,755
Can't trade my head
for a new one.

638
00:37:38,835 --> 00:37:41,436
I guess you're stuck
with the one you got.

639
00:37:41,515 --> 00:37:43,316
I'd invite you to my place,

640
00:37:43,396 --> 00:37:44,997
but it's a goddamn mess.

641
00:37:45,037 --> 00:37:46,597
You married, Bart?

642
00:37:47,437 --> 00:37:48,517
No.

643
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:51,078
I myself have yet
to be lassoed.

644
00:37:51,158 --> 00:37:53,038
Hey, Bart.

645
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,840
Ouch.

646
00:38:00,561 --> 00:38:02,041
Got a sweetheart?

647
00:38:02,921 --> 00:38:04,082
No.

648
00:38:05,162 --> 00:38:07,363
I guess it's something
about my work.

649
00:38:07,442 --> 00:38:09,563
I get so worked up over it.

650
00:38:09,643 --> 00:38:11,843
I don't have much attention left over,

651
00:38:11,924 --> 00:38:14,685
so it would be a little... unfair.

652
00:38:14,764 --> 00:38:17,085
Yeah. Ladies do ask for attention.

653
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:19,525
In my experience,
they pretend to give it,

654
00:38:19,606 --> 00:38:20,926
but it's generally a smoke screen

655
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,846
for demanding it back with interest.

656
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:24,206
How about family, Bart?

657
00:38:24,207 --> 00:38:26,407
How you fixed in that department?

658
00:38:26,488 --> 00:38:28,528
My folks live in Brooklyn
with my uncle.

659
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,768
Mine have passed on.

660
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,209
It's just us three now.

661
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,649
What's that expression?

662
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,050
Me, myself, and I.

663
00:38:36,091 --> 00:38:37,171
Sure.

664
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,131
That's tough.

665
00:38:39,171 --> 00:38:40,852
But in a sense,

666
00:38:40,892 --> 00:38:44,092
we're all alone in the world,
aren't we, Charlie?

667
00:38:44,132 --> 00:38:46,973
I'm often surrounded
by family and friends,

668
00:38:47,053 --> 00:38:48,414
but...

669
00:38:51,134 --> 00:38:54,135
You're no stranger
to loneliness, then.

670
00:38:54,175 --> 00:38:56,055
I guess I got no beef,

671
00:38:56,096 --> 00:38:57,936
especially where the dames
are concerned.

672
00:38:58,016 --> 00:39:00,857
In my line of work,
I got opportunities galore.

673
00:39:00,897 --> 00:39:03,697
I could tell you stories
to curl your hair,

674
00:39:03,778 --> 00:39:06,139
but it looks like you've
already heard them.

675
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,498
That's me in Kansas City
plying my trade.

676
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,419
That was taken by
one of my policyholders.

677
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,859
They're more than just customers
to me, Barton.

678
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,741
They appreciate
what I have to offer.

679
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,662
Her hubby was out of town,

680
00:39:17,701 --> 00:39:19,862
and they were carrying
fire and life.

681
00:39:19,942 --> 00:39:22,262
The third quarter payment
was way past due.

682
00:39:22,343 --> 00:39:24,183
In a way, I envy you...

683
00:39:24,263 --> 00:39:26,424
your daily routine,
you know what's expected.

684
00:39:26,503 --> 00:39:27,864
You know the drill.

685
00:39:29,865 --> 00:39:32,385
My job is to plumb the depths,

686
00:39:32,425 --> 00:39:33,705
so to speak.

687
00:39:33,706 --> 00:39:35,866
Dredge up something from inside,

688
00:39:35,946 --> 00:39:37,746
something honest.

689
00:39:37,827 --> 00:39:39,187
I got to tell you,

690
00:39:39,267 --> 00:39:40,747
the life of the mind...

691
00:39:40,828 --> 00:39:43,948
There's no road map
for that territory.

692
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:46,749
And exploring it
can be painful.

693
00:39:48,029 --> 00:39:51,750
I have pain most people
don't know anything about.

694
00:39:53,551 --> 00:39:55,112
This must be boring you.

695
00:39:55,191 --> 00:39:57,432
Not at all.
It's damned interesting.

696
00:39:57,512 --> 00:39:58,872
Yeah.

697
00:39:58,953 --> 00:40:00,273
Probably sounds a little grand

698
00:40:00,352 --> 00:40:02,593
for someone who's writing
a wrestling picture

699
00:40:02,674 --> 00:40:03,792
for Wallace Beery.

700
00:40:03,793 --> 00:40:05,674
Beery?
You got no beef there.

701
00:40:05,714 --> 00:40:07,555
He's a hell of an actor,

702
00:40:07,634 --> 00:40:09,515
though you can't beatJack Oakie.

703
00:40:09,555 --> 00:40:10,955
A stitch, Oakie.

704
00:40:10,996 --> 00:40:12,396
Funny stuff, funny stuff.

705
00:40:12,435 --> 00:40:13,996
But don't get me wrong.

706
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,237
Beery? Wrestling picture?
Could be a pip.

707
00:40:16,276 --> 00:40:17,837
Could be a pip.

708
00:40:17,878 --> 00:40:19,798
Wrestled myself some back in school.

709
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:21,999
I guess you know the basic moves.

710
00:40:22,038 --> 00:40:23,439
No. I never watched any.

711
00:40:23,479 --> 00:40:25,440
I'm not interested in the act.

712
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:27,720
Hell, you should know
what it's about.

713
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,041
I can show you
the wrestling basics in 30 seconds.

714
00:40:31,121 --> 00:40:33,441
You're a little
out of your weight class,

715
00:40:33,522 --> 00:40:34,842
but just for demonstration purposes...

716
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:35,961
That's all right.

717
00:40:35,962 --> 00:40:37,722
Not a bit of it, compadre.

718
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:39,203
Easiest thing in the world.

719
00:40:39,283 --> 00:40:42,083
Just get on your knees
to my left here.

720
00:40:42,164 --> 00:40:44,925
Slap your right hand here,
your left hand here.

721
00:40:45,004 --> 00:40:47,845
Come on, champ.
You can do it. Come on.

722
00:40:47,926 --> 00:40:49,566
Come on.

723
00:40:50,486 --> 00:40:51,606
Come on.

724
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:53,367
Come on.

725
00:40:54,487 --> 00:40:56,048
Yeah. There you go.

726
00:40:56,127 --> 00:40:57,608
Right there.

727
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:00,488
All right.

728
00:41:00,569 --> 00:41:02,449
Now, when I say, "Ready, wrestle,"

729
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:04,329
we try to pin each other.

730
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,290
That's the whole game.
Got it?

731
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,290
Yeah. Okay.

732
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:08,450
Ready? Wrestle.

733
00:41:08,451 --> 00:41:09,371
Oh!

734
00:41:09,411 --> 00:41:10,611
1, 2, 3.

735
00:41:10,692 --> 00:41:12,531
Damn. There I go again.

736
00:41:12,612 --> 00:41:14,612
Going to wake up
the downstairs neighbors.

737
00:41:14,693 --> 00:41:16,573
I didn't hurt you, did I?

738
00:41:16,613 --> 00:41:17,533
It's okay.

739
00:41:17,574 --> 00:41:19,013
Well, that's all wrestling is.

740
00:41:19,054 --> 00:41:20,734
Usually there's
more grunting and squirming

741
00:41:20,774 --> 00:41:22,013
before the pin.

742
00:41:22,014 --> 00:41:24,415
Well, you're out of your weight class.

743
00:41:24,495 --> 00:41:26,856
Jesus, I did hurt you.

744
00:41:26,896 --> 00:41:28,135
I sure do apologize.

745
00:41:28,136 --> 00:41:30,177
I'm just a big, clumsy lug.

746
00:41:30,256 --> 00:41:32,017
I sure do apologize.

747
00:41:32,097 --> 00:41:33,618
You sure you're okay?

748
00:41:33,697 --> 00:41:35,498
I'm fine, really.

749
00:41:36,538 --> 00:41:38,139
Actually, it's been helpful.

750
00:41:41,259 --> 00:41:44,581
But I guess I should get to work.

751
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,941
It wasn't fair of me to do that.

752
00:41:47,021 --> 00:41:48,862
I'm pretty well-endowed physically.

753
00:41:49,902 --> 00:41:51,182
Don't feel bad, though.

754
00:41:51,222 --> 00:41:54,063
I wouldn't be
much of a match for you

755
00:41:54,103 --> 00:41:55,343
at mental gymnastics.

756
00:41:55,383 --> 00:41:57,504
Give me a holler
you need anything.

757
00:42:30,472 --> 00:42:31,993
If I close my eyes,

758
00:42:32,073 --> 00:42:35,034
I can almost smell the live oak.

759
00:42:35,113 --> 00:42:38,434
That's chicken fat, Bill.

760
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:41,475
Well, my olfactory's
turning womanish on me...

761
00:42:41,556 --> 00:42:42,996
lying and deceitful.

762
00:42:43,075 --> 00:42:46,516
Still, I must say I haven't
felt peace like this

763
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:49,038
since the grand productive days.

764
00:42:49,117 --> 00:42:52,438
Don't you find it so, Barton?

765
00:42:52,479 --> 00:42:54,559
Ain't writing peace?

766
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,440
Well...

767
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,961
actually...

768
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,321
no, Bill.

769
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:07,483
No. I've always found

770
00:43:07,522 --> 00:43:10,523
that writing comes
from a great inner pain.

771
00:43:10,563 --> 00:43:13,484
Maybe it's a pain
that comes from a realization

772
00:43:13,564 --> 00:43:16,845
that one must do something
for one's fellow man

773
00:43:16,925 --> 00:43:20,046
to help somehow ease the suffering.

774
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:22,927
Maybe it's personal pain.

775
00:43:23,006 --> 00:43:25,327
At any rate, I don't believe

776
00:43:25,407 --> 00:43:27,728
good work is possible without it.

777
00:43:27,807 --> 00:43:28,808
Hmm.

778
00:43:28,889 --> 00:43:33,289
Well, me, I just enjoy
making things up.

779
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:35,650
Yes, sir. Escape.

780
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:39,211
It's when I can't write
and escape myself,

781
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:41,612
that I want to rip my head off

782
00:43:41,691 --> 00:43:43,532
and run screaming through the street

783
00:43:43,612 --> 00:43:46,452
with my balls
in a fruit picker's pail.

784
00:43:46,533 --> 00:43:47,373
Hmm.

785
00:43:47,453 --> 00:43:49,134
This will sometimes help.

786
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:51,174
That doesn't help anything, Bill.

787
00:43:51,214 --> 00:43:53,494
I've never found that
to help my writing.

788
00:43:53,575 --> 00:43:55,255
Your writing?

789
00:43:55,335 --> 00:43:58,816
Son, have you ever heard
the story of Solomon's mammy?

790
00:43:58,896 --> 00:44:00,697
Barton, you should read this.

791
00:44:00,776 --> 00:44:02,137
I think it's Bill's finest,

792
00:44:02,217 --> 00:44:03,578
or among his finest, anyway.

793
00:44:03,657 --> 00:44:05,498
So now I'm supposed to roll over

794
00:44:05,578 --> 00:44:06,898
and get my belly scratched?

795
00:44:06,938 --> 00:44:07,858
Bill.

796
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:09,058
Look, uh...

797
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:10,899
maybe it's none of my business,

798
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:13,780
but don't you think
a man with your talent...

799
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,700
your first obligation
is to your gift?

800
00:44:15,741 --> 00:44:17,941
Shouldn't you be doing
whatever you have to

801
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:19,260
to work again?

802
00:44:19,261 --> 00:44:20,782
What would that be?

803
00:44:20,862 --> 00:44:22,102
I don't know.

804
00:44:22,103 --> 00:44:23,381
But with that drink,

805
00:44:23,382 --> 00:44:25,463
you're cutting yourself
off from your gift

806
00:44:25,544 --> 00:44:26,784
and your fellow man

807
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,704
and everything your art is about.

808
00:44:28,784 --> 00:44:30,065
Oh, no, son.

809
00:44:30,104 --> 00:44:31,785
I'm building a levee...

810
00:44:31,864 --> 00:44:34,385
gulp by gulp,
brick by brick...

811
00:44:34,426 --> 00:44:35,705
Putting up a levee

812
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:37,906
to keep that raging river of manure

813
00:44:37,946 --> 00:44:39,387
from lapping at my door.

814
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,827
Maybe you better, too, Barton,

815
00:44:40,867 --> 00:44:43,068
before you get buried
under his manure.

816
00:44:43,108 --> 00:44:45,228
My honey pretends
to be impatient with me,

817
00:44:45,309 --> 00:44:47,149
but she'll put up with anything.

818
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:48,509
Not anything, Bill.

819
00:44:48,549 --> 00:44:49,790
Don't test me.

820
00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:53,631
You're lucky she puts up with you
as much as she does.

821
00:44:53,671 --> 00:44:55,071
Maybe to a schoolboy's eyes.

822
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:57,472
People who know about
the human heart, though,

823
00:44:57,512 --> 00:44:59,392
maybe they'd say,
"Bill over here,

824
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:00,832
he gives his honey love,

825
00:45:00,913 --> 00:45:03,073
and she pays him back with pity,

826
00:45:03,153 --> 00:45:04,514
the basest coin there is."

827
00:45:04,594 --> 00:45:06,514
Stop it, Bill.

828
00:45:06,634 --> 00:45:08,355
Gone are the days

829
00:45:08,435 --> 00:45:12,036
When my heart was young and gay

830
00:45:12,075 --> 00:45:15,036
Gone are my friends

831
00:45:15,116 --> 00:45:19,517
From the cotton fields away

832
00:45:19,558 --> 00:45:21,998
Gone from the earth

833
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,199
To a better land I know

834
00:45:25,279 --> 00:45:27,760
I hear their gentle voices

835
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,161
Callin'Old Black Joe

836
00:45:33,241 --> 00:45:34,922
I'm comin'

837
00:45:35,001 --> 00:45:37,322
I'm comin'

838
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:41,483
Oh, my head is bending low

839
00:45:41,524 --> 00:45:44,965
I hear their gentle...

840
00:45:45,044 --> 00:45:47,885
The truth, my honey, is a tart

841
00:45:47,925 --> 00:45:50,765
that does not bear scrutiny.

842
00:45:50,806 --> 00:45:53,767
Breach my levee at your peril!

843
00:45:53,847 --> 00:45:57,168
Gone are my friends

844
00:45:57,247 --> 00:45:58,928
From the cotton fields...

845
00:45:59,008 --> 00:46:00,849
That son of a bitch!

846
00:46:00,889 --> 00:46:03,249
Don't get me wrong.
He's a fine writer.

847
00:46:03,289 --> 00:46:06,130
Gone from the earth

848
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:07,450
Are you all right?

849
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:09,331
To a better life I know

850
00:46:09,371 --> 00:46:11,251
Audrey, y-you can't...

851
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:12,692
Oh, Barton.

852
00:46:12,731 --> 00:46:14,932
You can't put up with that.

853
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:17,453
Old Black Joe

854
00:46:17,533 --> 00:46:19,654
I feel so sorry for him.

855
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:22,534
What? He's... He's a son of a bitch.

856
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:24,295
No.

857
00:46:24,374 --> 00:46:25,736
No.

858
00:46:26,936 --> 00:46:28,336
He...

859
00:46:28,376 --> 00:46:30,336
He sometimes just...

860
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:32,937
I hear their angel voices...

861
00:46:33,017 --> 00:46:35,497
Well, he thinks about Estelle.

862
00:46:35,578 --> 00:46:38,219
His wife still lives
in Fayettesville.

863
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:40,459
She's...

864
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,780
disturbed.

865
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,541
Really?

866
00:46:48,221 --> 00:46:51,342
I'll just walk on down
to the Pacific,

867
00:46:51,422 --> 00:46:53,583
and from there I'll improvise.

868
00:46:53,663 --> 00:46:55,703
He'll wander back
when he's sober

869
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,863
and apologize.

870
00:46:56,864 --> 00:46:58,104
He always does.

871
00:46:58,143 --> 00:46:59,984
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his...

872
00:47:00,064 --> 00:47:01,265
Silence upon the hill...

873
00:47:01,345 --> 00:47:02,265
behavior.

874
00:47:02,305 --> 00:47:03,225
In Darien!

875
00:47:03,265 --> 00:47:05,626
Empathy requires understanding.

876
00:47:05,665 --> 00:47:06,866
I'm comin'

877
00:47:06,946 --> 00:47:07,987
What?

878
00:47:08,066 --> 00:47:09,467
What don't I understand?

879
00:47:09,506 --> 00:47:10,387
I'm comin'

880
00:47:10,467 --> 00:47:15,028
Oh, my head is hangin'low

881
00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:18,150
I hear their gentle voices

882
00:47:18,229 --> 00:47:23,030
Callin'Old Black Joe

883
00:48:44,892 --> 00:48:47,293
I hope these are your shoes.

884
00:48:47,332 --> 00:48:48,694
Charlie.

885
00:48:48,733 --> 00:48:50,614
Because that would mean...

886
00:48:50,653 --> 00:48:51,894
they gave you mine.

887
00:48:51,934 --> 00:48:53,014
Yeah.

888
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,895
As a matter of fact, they did.

889
00:48:55,935 --> 00:48:57,696
Come on in.

890
00:48:57,736 --> 00:48:59,576
Jesus, what a day I had.

891
00:49:01,216 --> 00:49:03,577
Ever have one of those days?

892
00:49:03,617 --> 00:49:05,177
Seems like nothing but lately.

893
00:49:05,258 --> 00:49:06,618
Jesus, what a day.

894
00:49:06,658 --> 00:49:10,299
Felt like I couldn't have sold
ice water in the Sahara.

895
00:49:10,339 --> 00:49:12,179
Okay. So you don't want insurance.

896
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,740
Okay. So that's your loss.

897
00:49:13,819 --> 00:49:15,821
But, God, people can be rude.

898
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,941
I feel like I have to talk

899
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,822
to a normal person like you

900
00:49:19,901 --> 00:49:22,062
just to restore a little of my...

901
00:49:22,142 --> 00:49:23,503
It's my pleasure.

902
00:49:23,582 --> 00:49:25,943
I could use a little lift myself.

903
00:49:26,023 --> 00:49:27,664
A little lift? Yeah.

904
00:49:27,744 --> 00:49:30,385
Good thing they bottle it, huh, pal?

905
00:49:31,264 --> 00:49:32,625
Did I say rude?

906
00:49:32,705 --> 00:49:35,346
People can be goddamn cruel,

907
00:49:35,426 --> 00:49:37,466
especially some of these housewives.

908
00:49:37,546 --> 00:49:38,386
Okay.

909
00:49:38,467 --> 00:49:40,467
So I have a weight problem.

910
00:49:40,547 --> 00:49:42,068
That's my cross to bear.

911
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:43,708
I don't know.

912
00:49:43,788 --> 00:49:45,108
It's a defense mechanism.

913
00:49:45,188 --> 00:49:46,549
Defense against what, insurance?

914
00:49:46,628 --> 00:49:47,868
Something they need?

915
00:49:47,869 --> 00:49:50,710
Something they should be
grateful to me for offering?

916
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:52,470
A little peace of mind.

917
00:49:55,271 --> 00:49:57,591
Finally decided
to knock off early.

918
00:49:57,672 --> 00:49:59,832
Went to see a doctor about this.

919
00:49:59,912 --> 00:50:02,273
He told me I had an ear infection.

920
00:50:02,353 --> 00:50:03,593
$10, please.

921
00:50:03,593 --> 00:50:06,874
I says, "Hell, I told you
my ear was infected.

922
00:50:06,954 --> 00:50:08,795
Why don't you give me $10?"

923
00:50:08,874 --> 00:50:11,276
Well, that led to an argument.

924
00:50:15,076 --> 00:50:16,917
Listen to me bellyaching,

925
00:50:16,956 --> 00:50:20,397
as if my problems amounted
to a hill of beans.

926
00:50:20,478 --> 00:50:23,118
How goes the life of the mind?

927
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:25,199
Well, it's been better.

928
00:50:25,279 --> 00:50:28,120
I can't seem to get going
on this thing.

929
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:29,439
That one idea,

930
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,640
the one that lets you get started,

931
00:50:31,721 --> 00:50:33,081
I still haven't gotten it.

932
00:50:33,161 --> 00:50:35,481
Maybe I only had one idea in me...

933
00:50:35,562 --> 00:50:36,442
my play.

934
00:50:36,482 --> 00:50:37,883
Maybe once that was done,

935
00:50:37,962 --> 00:50:39,803
I was done being a writer.

936
00:50:39,883 --> 00:50:41,884
Christ, I feel like a fraud,

937
00:50:41,963 --> 00:50:44,404
sitting here staring at this paper.

938
00:50:44,444 --> 00:50:48,725
Those two lovebirds next door
driving you nuts?

939
00:50:50,526 --> 00:50:52,447
How do you know about that?

940
00:50:52,486 --> 00:50:53,725
Know about it?

941
00:50:53,726 --> 00:50:56,087
I can practically see
how they're doing it.

942
00:50:56,167 --> 00:50:58,968
Brother, I wish I had
a piece of that.

943
00:50:59,008 --> 00:51:00,448
Seems like I hear everything

944
00:51:00,488 --> 00:51:02,329
that goes on in this dump...

945
00:51:02,369 --> 00:51:03,689
the pipes or something.

946
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:04,889
Yeah, but...

947
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,290
You'll lick this picture business.

948
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:08,410
You got a head on your shoulders.

949
00:51:08,491 --> 00:51:09,769
What do they say?

950
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:11,331
Where there's a head, there's hope.

951
00:51:11,411 --> 00:51:12,771
Where there's life, there's hope.

952
00:51:12,852 --> 00:51:15,292
See, that proves
you really are a writer.

953
00:51:15,332 --> 00:51:17,253
There's hope for you, too, Charlie.

954
00:51:17,292 --> 00:51:20,134
Tomorrow I bet you sell
a half-dozen policies.

955
00:51:20,173 --> 00:51:22,054
Thanks, brother, but the fact is

956
00:51:22,094 --> 00:51:24,735
I got to pull up stakes for a while.

957
00:51:28,776 --> 00:51:30,015
You're leaving?

958
00:51:30,016 --> 00:51:31,295
In a few days.

959
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,577
Out to your stomping grounds...
New York City.

960
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:36,458
Things got all balled up
at the head office.

961
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:40,939
I'm truly sorry to hear that.
I'll miss you.

962
00:51:40,979 --> 00:51:43,300
Well, hell, buddy.
Don't pull a long face.

963
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,060
I keep a room here,

964
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,461
and I'll be back sooner or later.

965
00:51:47,501 --> 00:51:48,702
And mark my words,

966
00:51:48,781 --> 00:51:50,622
by the time I get back,

967
00:51:50,702 --> 00:51:52,062
your picture will be finished.

968
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:54,463
New York can be
pretty cruel to strangers.

969
00:51:54,543 --> 00:51:56,543
If you need a home-cooked meal,

970
00:51:56,623 --> 00:51:59,424
you just look up
Sam and Lillian Fink.

971
00:51:59,504 --> 00:52:01,664
They live on Fulton Street...

972
00:52:02,545 --> 00:52:04,066
with my uncle Maury.

973
00:52:14,268 --> 00:52:16,629
Christ.

974
00:52:16,669 --> 00:52:19,509
Your room does that, too.

975
00:52:19,589 --> 00:52:22,710
I guess the heat's
sweating off the wallpaper.

976
00:52:23,911 --> 00:52:25,271
What a dump.

977
00:52:25,311 --> 00:52:28,152
I guess this must seem pretty pathetic

978
00:52:28,231 --> 00:52:30,072
to a guy like you.

979
00:52:30,112 --> 00:52:31,513
Well...

980
00:52:31,552 --> 00:52:34,394
But it's pathetic, isn't it?

981
00:52:34,473 --> 00:52:37,274
I mean, to a guy from New York?

982
00:52:37,314 --> 00:52:39,514
What do you mean?

983
00:52:39,595 --> 00:52:40,955
This kind of heat.

984
00:52:41,035 --> 00:52:42,395
It's pathetic.

985
00:52:42,436 --> 00:52:44,957
Well, I guess
you pick your poison.

986
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,877
So they say.

987
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:49,758
Don't pick up and leave
without saying good-bye.

988
00:52:49,797 --> 00:52:51,678
'Course not, compadre.

989
00:52:51,758 --> 00:52:53,719
You'll see me again.

990
00:54:09,419 --> 00:54:10,378
Zing! Bango!

991
00:54:10,379 --> 00:54:11,699
You're dead.
You're a corpse.

992
00:54:11,779 --> 00:54:13,058
You got me.

993
00:54:13,059 --> 00:54:15,540
Okay, go, go, you son of a gun.

994
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,981
Yeah, Fink.

995
00:54:19,941 --> 00:54:21,301
Come on, come on.

996
00:54:22,822 --> 00:54:25,262
What do you got for me?

997
00:54:25,343 --> 00:54:27,024
What the hell happened to your face?

998
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:29,144
Nothing.
It's just a mosquito bite.

999
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,385
There are no mosquitoes
in Los Angeles.

1000
00:54:31,464 --> 00:54:33,305
Mosquitoes breed in swamps.
This is a desert.

1001
00:54:33,385 --> 00:54:34,785
What do you got for me?

1002
00:54:34,865 --> 00:54:35,865
Well, I...

1003
00:54:35,946 --> 00:54:38,147
On the Beery picture, where are we?

1004
00:54:38,226 --> 00:54:40,466
Well, I'm having a little trouble
getting started.

1005
00:54:40,467 --> 00:54:41,947
Getting start...
ChristJesus, started?

1006
00:54:42,027 --> 00:54:43,507
You don't have anything yet?

1007
00:54:43,588 --> 00:54:44,828
Well, not much.

1008
00:54:44,908 --> 00:54:47,228
What the hell do you
think this is, Hamlet,

1009
00:54:47,309 --> 00:54:49,149
Gone With the Wind,
Ruggles of Red Gap?

1010
00:54:49,229 --> 00:54:50,909
It's a goddamn B picture...

1011
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:52,670
big men in tights...
you know the drill.

1012
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:54,471
I don't really understand that genre.

1013
00:54:54,551 --> 00:54:56,271
Maybe that's the problem.

1014
00:54:56,351 --> 00:54:57,550
Understand? Shit!

1015
00:54:57,551 --> 00:54:59,431
You were going to consult
another writer on this.

1016
00:54:59,432 --> 00:55:00,992
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew.

1017
00:55:01,072 --> 00:55:03,473
Mayhew? Some help.
The guy's a souse.

1018
00:55:03,553 --> 00:55:04,712
He's a great writer.

1019
00:55:04,713 --> 00:55:05,793
A great souse!

1020
00:55:05,794 --> 00:55:08,315
He's in pain
because he can't write.

1021
00:55:08,394 --> 00:55:09,473
Souse! Souse!

1022
00:55:09,474 --> 00:55:10,915
He manages to write his name

1023
00:55:10,955 --> 00:55:13,116
on the back
of his paycheck every week.

1024
00:55:13,155 --> 00:55:15,476
I thought no one cared
about this picture.

1025
00:55:15,556 --> 00:55:16,676
You thought?

1026
00:55:16,677 --> 00:55:19,357
I don't know
what the hell you said to Lipnick,

1027
00:55:19,438 --> 00:55:21,797
but the son of a bitch likes you.

1028
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:24,639
He's taken a interest.

1029
00:55:24,678 --> 00:55:27,079
Never make Lipnick like you.

1030
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,040
Never!

1031
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,319
I... I don't understand.

1032
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,560
Are you deaf?
He likes you.

1033
00:55:31,641 --> 00:55:33,961
What the hell did you say to him?

1034
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:34,922
Nothing.

1035
00:55:34,961 --> 00:55:36,642
Well, he's taken a interest.

1036
00:55:36,682 --> 00:55:39,043
He'll make your life hell.

1037
00:55:39,082 --> 00:55:40,523
Since I drew the short straw

1038
00:55:40,563 --> 00:55:41,923
to supervise this turkey,

1039
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,883
he'll be all over me, too.

1040
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,884
Fat-ass son of a bitch called yesterday

1041
00:55:45,964 --> 00:55:47,685
to ask how it's going.

1042
00:55:47,724 --> 00:55:50,085
I said you were making progress.

1043
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:51,526
We were all very excited.

1044
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:54,127
I told him it was great.

1045
00:55:54,206 --> 00:55:55,206
Understand that?

1046
00:55:55,207 --> 00:55:57,207
Now my ass is on the line.

1047
00:55:57,288 --> 00:56:00,128
He wants you to tell him
all about it tomorrow.

1048
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:01,969
I can't write anything by tomorrow.

1049
00:56:02,049 --> 00:56:04,409
Who said write?
Jesus, Jack can't read.

1050
00:56:04,489 --> 00:56:06,330
You got to tell it to him.

1051
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:09,250
Tell him something,
for Christ's sake.

1052
00:56:09,331 --> 00:56:11,731
Well, what do I t-tell him?

1053
00:56:17,453 --> 00:56:18,813
Yes, Mr. Geezler.

1054
00:56:18,893 --> 00:56:20,293
Projection!

1055
00:56:20,373 --> 00:56:21,213
Jerry.

1056
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,654
Jerry, Ben Geisler here.

1057
00:56:22,734 --> 00:56:24,094
Any screening rooms free?

1058
00:56:24,175 --> 00:56:26,055
Good! Book it for me.

1059
00:56:26,135 --> 00:56:27,935
I got a writer here.
He's coming in.

1060
00:56:28,016 --> 00:56:30,016
You're going to show him
wrestling pictures.

1061
00:56:30,096 --> 00:56:31,737
I don't give a shit which ones!

1062
00:56:31,816 --> 00:56:34,697
Isn't Victor Sjoderberg
shooting one now?

1063
00:56:34,777 --> 00:56:36,138
Show him some dailies on that.

1064
00:56:36,218 --> 00:56:37,258
Okay, Ben.

1065
00:56:37,338 --> 00:56:38,498
All right.

1066
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:40,418
This will give you some ideas.

1067
00:56:40,499 --> 00:56:44,180
8:15 tomorrow morning
at Lipnick's house.

1068
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:49,021
Ideas.

1069
00:56:49,101 --> 00:56:50,461
Broad strokes.

1070
00:56:52,222 --> 00:56:55,303
Don't cross me, Fink.

1071
00:56:56,623 --> 00:56:58,464
Devil on the Can...

1072
00:56:58,543 --> 00:57:01,024
Devil on the Canvas,
12 Apple, take 1.

1073
00:57:01,105 --> 00:57:02,305
Action!

1074
00:57:02,384 --> 00:57:03,865
I will destroy him!

1075
00:57:03,905 --> 00:57:05,466
Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut!

1076
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,306
Devil on the Canvas,
12 Apple, take 2.

1077
00:57:08,386 --> 00:57:09,747
Action!

1078
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:11,387
I will destroy him!

1079
00:57:11,467 --> 00:57:12,787
Cut! Cut!

1080
00:57:13,828 --> 00:57:14,828
Rolling!

1081
00:57:14,908 --> 00:57:17,348
Devil on the Canvas,
12 Apple, take 4.

1082
00:57:17,429 --> 00:57:18,309
Action!

1083
00:57:18,389 --> 00:57:20,749
I will destroy him!

1084
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:22,109
Cut! Cut! Cut!

1085
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:24,391
Devil on the Canvas,
12 Apple, take 5.

1086
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:26,631
I will destroy him!

1087
00:57:26,711 --> 00:57:28,232
12 Apple, take 6.

1088
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:29,832
I will destroy him!

1089
00:57:29,912 --> 00:57:31,912
12 Apple, take 7.

1090
00:57:31,992 --> 00:57:33,673
I will destroy him!

1091
00:57:33,753 --> 00:57:35,032
12 Baker, take 1.

1092
00:57:35,033 --> 00:57:38,675
I will destroy him!

1093
00:57:38,754 --> 00:57:40,395
Aah!

1094
00:57:41,955 --> 00:57:44,556
Aah!

1095
00:57:44,636 --> 00:57:46,276
Aah!

1096
00:57:46,357 --> 00:57:47,277
Aah!

1097
00:57:47,356 --> 00:57:49,077
12 Charlie, take 1.

1098
00:57:49,157 --> 00:57:50,517
- Aah!
- Aah!

1099
00:57:50,598 --> 00:57:52,278
- Aah!
- Aah!

1100
00:57:52,358 --> 00:57:53,398
Take 2.

1101
00:57:53,478 --> 00:57:55,879
- Aah!
- Aah!

1102
00:57:55,959 --> 00:57:58,040
2...

1103
00:57:58,119 --> 00:57:59,200
Take 7.

1104
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,520
- Aah!
- Aah!

1105
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,081
2...

1106
00:58:03,161 --> 00:58:05,481
- Aah!
- Aah!

1107
00:58:05,521 --> 00:58:06,962
- Aah!
- Aah!

1108
00:58:07,042 --> 00:58:08,482
- Aah!
- Aah!

1109
00:58:08,562 --> 00:58:10,723
- Aah!
- Aah!

1110
00:58:10,803 --> 00:58:13,163
Aah!

1111
00:58:34,649 --> 00:58:36,209
Orphan.

1112
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:37,490
Dame.

1113
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:40,851
Front desk.

1114
00:58:40,931 --> 00:58:42,291
Hello, Chet?

1115
00:58:42,331 --> 00:58:44,171
This is Barton Fink in room 621.

1116
00:58:44,252 --> 00:58:46,132
Could you try a number for me
in Hollywood?

1117
00:58:46,172 --> 00:58:49,053
Slauson 6-4304.

1118
00:58:49,093 --> 00:58:50,613
Right away, sir.

1119
00:58:52,854 --> 00:58:54,255
Pick it up.
Pick it up.

1120
00:58:54,334 --> 00:58:55,215
Hello.

1121
00:58:55,294 --> 00:58:56,655
Audrey, I need help.

1122
00:58:56,735 --> 00:58:59,016
I know I shouldn't be
calling you like this.

1123
00:58:59,096 --> 00:59:01,536
I wouldn't have
if I could see any alternative.

1124
00:59:01,537 --> 00:59:03,817
I'm sorry.
Listen, how are you?

1125
00:59:03,897 --> 00:59:05,297
You doing okay?

1126
00:59:05,378 --> 00:59:06,698
Who is this?

1127
00:59:06,778 --> 00:59:09,099
Barton! I'm sorry.
It's Barton Fink.

1128
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:11,979
Barton, I'm afraid
it's not a good time.

1129
00:59:12,059 --> 00:59:14,420
I'm sorry.
I just feel like I need...

1130
00:59:14,499 --> 00:59:16,300
I know I shouldn't ask.

1131
00:59:16,381 --> 00:59:19,221
I just need some kind of help.

1132
00:59:19,301 --> 00:59:21,621
I have a deadline tomorrow.

1133
00:59:21,702 --> 00:59:23,022
All right, Barton.

1134
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:24,983
I'll see if I can slip away.

1135
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:26,383
Oh, if you could...

1136
00:59:26,463 --> 00:59:28,343
If I can.

1137
00:59:28,424 --> 00:59:30,264
He... He gets jealous.

1138
00:59:30,344 --> 00:59:31,664
I need help, Audrey.

1139
00:59:33,225 --> 00:59:34,545
I'll try to slip out

1140
00:59:34,626 --> 00:59:37,906
if he quiets down, passes out.

1141
00:59:37,986 --> 00:59:40,266
I'm afraid he thinks...

1142
00:59:40,347 --> 00:59:43,187
Well, he said you were
a buffoon, Barton.

1143
00:59:43,268 --> 00:59:44,188
Uh-huh.

1144
00:59:44,267 --> 00:59:45,628
He becomes irrational.

1145
00:59:46,949 --> 00:59:47,947
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1146
00:59:47,948 --> 00:59:49,349
I'll try and slip away.

1147
00:59:49,389 --> 00:59:51,109
Who is that?

1148
01:00:07,674 --> 01:00:10,515
Audrey, thank you for coming.

1149
01:00:10,594 --> 01:00:11,475
Thank you.

1150
01:00:11,555 --> 01:00:12,514
Hello, Barton.

1151
01:00:12,515 --> 01:00:14,356
I'm sorry to be...

1152
01:00:14,435 --> 01:00:16,877
such a... such a...

1153
01:00:18,276 --> 01:00:19,157
Thank you.

1154
01:00:19,197 --> 01:00:21,837
That's all right, Barton.

1155
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:24,279
Everything's going to be all right.

1156
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:26,199
Yes. Thank you.

1157
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:27,440
Thank you.

1158
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,880
Yes. Thank you.

1159
01:00:31,681 --> 01:00:33,041
How's Bill?

1160
01:00:33,081 --> 01:00:35,962
Oh, he's, uh...

1161
01:00:36,001 --> 01:00:37,402
He drifted off.

1162
01:00:37,442 --> 01:00:39,923
He'll sleep for a while now.

1163
01:00:41,283 --> 01:00:43,843
What is it you have to do exactly?

1164
01:00:43,923 --> 01:00:47,924
Well, I have to come up
with an outline,

1165
01:00:47,965 --> 01:00:49,805
I guess you call it,

1166
01:00:49,885 --> 01:00:52,686
the whole goddamn story,
soup to nuts, three acts,

1167
01:00:52,766 --> 01:00:54,526
the whole goddamn...

1168
01:00:54,607 --> 01:00:55,886
That's all right, Barton.

1169
01:00:55,967 --> 01:00:58,168
You don't have to write
actual scenes.

1170
01:00:58,207 --> 01:01:01,968
No, but the whole goddamn...

1171
01:01:03,329 --> 01:01:05,170
Audrey...

1172
01:01:05,249 --> 01:01:08,370
have you ever read
any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?

1173
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:11,011
Yes, I'm afraid I have.

1174
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:14,452
What are they like?
What are they about?

1175
01:01:14,531 --> 01:01:16,212
Well...

1176
01:01:16,293 --> 01:01:19,933
usually they're simple morality tales.

1177
01:01:19,973 --> 01:01:23,414
There's a good wrestler
and a bad wrestler,

1178
01:01:23,494 --> 01:01:25,455
whom he confronts at the end.

1179
01:01:25,534 --> 01:01:27,815
In between, the good wrestler
has a love interest

1180
01:01:27,816 --> 01:01:30,616
or a small child he has to protect.

1181
01:01:30,696 --> 01:01:32,376
Bill would usually make
the good wrestler

1182
01:01:32,457 --> 01:01:34,737
a backwards type or a convict,

1183
01:01:34,818 --> 01:01:38,058
and sometimes, instead of a waif,

1184
01:01:38,138 --> 01:01:41,699
he'd have the wrestler
protecting an idiot man-child.

1185
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:44,620
The studio always hated that.

1186
01:01:44,699 --> 01:01:47,180
Some of the scripts were so...

1187
01:01:47,261 --> 01:01:48,461
spirited.

1188
01:01:52,502 --> 01:01:56,502
Barton, look,
it's really just a formula.

1189
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:58,863
You don't have to type
your soul into it.

1190
01:01:58,944 --> 01:02:01,144
We'll invent some names
and a new setting.

1191
01:02:01,224 --> 01:02:03,185
I'll help you.
It won't take any time at all.

1192
01:02:03,264 --> 01:02:05,585
I did it for Bill so many times.

1193
01:02:05,666 --> 01:02:07,506
You did what for Bill?

1194
01:02:07,546 --> 01:02:10,386
Well... this.

1195
01:02:10,467 --> 01:02:13,547
You wrote his scripts for him?

1196
01:02:16,228 --> 01:02:20,309
Well, the basic ideas
were frequently his.

1197
01:02:20,389 --> 01:02:23,830
You wrote Bill's scripts?

1198
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:25,590
Jesus, you wrote his...

1199
01:02:25,671 --> 01:02:27,391
Well, what about before that?

1200
01:02:27,471 --> 01:02:28,390
Before what?

1201
01:02:28,391 --> 01:02:31,032
Before Bill came to Hollywood.

1202
01:02:31,112 --> 01:02:33,913
Bill was always the author,
so to speak.

1203
01:02:33,993 --> 01:02:36,914
What do you mean, "so to speak"?

1204
01:02:36,993 --> 01:02:40,795
Audrey, how long have you been his...

1205
01:02:40,834 --> 01:02:42,075
secretary?

1206
01:02:42,155 --> 01:02:44,795
Let's concentrate
on our little project.

1207
01:02:44,876 --> 01:02:47,315
I want to know how many
of Bill's books you wrote!

1208
01:02:47,316 --> 01:02:48,515
I want to know!

1209
01:02:48,516 --> 01:02:50,517
Barton, honestly...

1210
01:02:53,238 --> 01:02:55,118
Only the last couple.

1211
01:02:55,199 --> 01:02:56,279
Hah!

1212
01:02:56,318 --> 01:03:00,400
And my input was
mostly editorial, really,

1213
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,120
after he had been drinking.

1214
01:03:02,201 --> 01:03:03,281
I'll bet.

1215
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:07,082
Jesus, "the grand productive days"!

1216
01:03:07,161 --> 01:03:09,322
What a goddamn phony.

1217
01:03:09,402 --> 01:03:10,923
W.P. Mayhew...

1218
01:03:11,002 --> 01:03:13,564
William goddamn Phony Mayhew!

1219
01:03:13,604 --> 01:03:15,364
All his guff about escape!

1220
01:03:15,444 --> 01:03:18,284
I'll say he escaped!

1221
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:21,885
We don't have much time.

1222
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:28,207
It'll be fine.

1223
01:03:28,287 --> 01:03:31,408
Don't judge him, Barton.

1224
01:03:32,649 --> 01:03:35,889
Don't condescend to him.

1225
01:03:35,969 --> 01:03:40,171
I help Bill most
by understanding him,

1226
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:42,211
by appreciating him.

1227
01:03:44,052 --> 01:03:47,372
We all need understanding, Barton...

1228
01:03:47,412 --> 01:03:50,213
even you tonight.

1229
01:03:50,253 --> 01:03:52,654
It's all you really need.

1230
01:06:55,382 --> 01:06:57,143
Aah!

1231
01:06:57,183 --> 01:06:58,903
Aah!

1232
01:06:58,984 --> 01:07:00,263
Aah!

1233
01:07:07,746 --> 01:07:08,626
Barton?

1234
01:07:20,949 --> 01:07:22,550
Barton, are you all right?

1235
01:07:22,629 --> 01:07:23,589
I'm fine, thanks.

1236
01:07:23,589 --> 01:07:24,470
You sure?

1237
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:25,591
No! No.

1238
01:09:33,745 --> 01:09:35,825
Barton. Are you all right?

1239
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:37,785
No. Can I come in?

1240
01:09:37,866 --> 01:09:39,666
Let's go to your room.

1241
01:09:39,746 --> 01:09:42,547
Charlie, I'm in trouble.
You got to help me.

1242
01:09:42,627 --> 01:09:44,468
Get a grip on yourself, brother.

1243
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:47,348
Whatever the problem is,
we can sort it out.

1244
01:09:47,428 --> 01:09:49,828
Charlie, I'm in trouble.
Something horrible's happened.

1245
01:09:49,829 --> 01:09:51,669
I got to call the police.

1246
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:54,550
Will you stay with me
till they get here?

1247
01:09:54,631 --> 01:09:57,551
Don't worry about it.
We can work it out.

1248
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:59,832
Before you go in...
I didn't do this.

1249
01:09:59,911 --> 01:10:02,713
I don't know how it happened, but...

1250
01:10:02,792 --> 01:10:04,033
I didn't.

1251
01:10:04,112 --> 01:10:06,233
I want you to know that.

1252
01:10:12,754 --> 01:10:13,755
Okay.

1253
01:10:19,997 --> 01:10:21,037
Ohhh!

1254
01:10:25,919 --> 01:10:26,839
Oh...

1255
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:35,561
Oh...

1256
01:10:39,842 --> 01:10:42,203
Jesus, Barton,
what the hell is this?

1257
01:10:42,243 --> 01:10:43,683
What are we going to do?

1258
01:10:43,763 --> 01:10:44,722
Call the police.

1259
01:10:44,723 --> 01:10:45,724
Hold on.

1260
01:10:45,804 --> 01:10:47,084
I didn't do this.

1261
01:10:47,164 --> 01:10:48,604
I did not do this!

1262
01:10:48,685 --> 01:10:49,524
Hold on!

1263
01:10:49,605 --> 01:10:50,645
Stop.

1264
01:10:50,685 --> 01:10:53,125
Take a deep breath.
Tell me what happened.

1265
01:10:53,206 --> 01:10:55,886
I passed out! I don't know!
Won't the police...

1266
01:10:55,966 --> 01:10:57,927
Stop with the police!
Wake up!

1267
01:10:58,007 --> 01:11:00,127
This looks bad!
They hang people for this!

1268
01:11:00,208 --> 01:11:03,089
But I didn't do it.
Don't you believe me?

1269
01:11:03,168 --> 01:11:06,289
I believe you! I know you!
Why should the police?

1270
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:09,130
Did you...

1271
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:12,170
Barton, between you and me,

1272
01:11:12,251 --> 01:11:14,332
did you have sexual intercourse?

1273
01:11:17,052 --> 01:11:18,813
Jesus, they can tell that.

1274
01:11:18,892 --> 01:11:21,853
Got to believe me!

1275
01:11:21,933 --> 01:11:24,294
They got to have mercy!

1276
01:11:24,334 --> 01:11:25,735
You're in pictures, Barton.

1277
01:11:25,774 --> 01:11:28,055
Even if they cleared you eventually,

1278
01:11:28,135 --> 01:11:29,576
this would ruin you.

1279
01:11:32,056 --> 01:11:32,936
Come on.

1280
01:11:33,016 --> 01:11:34,497
Wait in the bathroom.

1281
01:11:56,183 --> 01:12:00,144
Oh, Lord.
Oh, Lordy. Oh, my Lord.

1282
01:12:00,223 --> 01:12:03,025
Oh, my Lord.

1283
01:12:04,785 --> 01:12:05,825
Ooh!

1284
01:12:17,308 --> 01:12:19,028
You passed out.

1285
01:12:21,029 --> 01:12:22,148
Where's Audrey?

1286
01:12:22,149 --> 01:12:23,509
She's dead, Barton!

1287
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:26,030
She's dead, if that was her name!

1288
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:29,112
You got to act
as if nothing has happened.

1289
01:12:29,191 --> 01:12:31,512
Put this totally out of your head.

1290
01:12:31,592 --> 01:12:34,713
Your play is to go about
your business as usual.

1291
01:12:34,793 --> 01:12:37,874
Give us some time
to sort this out.

1292
01:12:46,836 --> 01:12:49,436
Bart!
So happy to see ya!

1293
01:12:50,477 --> 01:12:52,678
Sit. Talk.
Relax for a minute.

1294
01:12:52,757 --> 01:12:54,118
Then talk.

1295
01:12:54,198 --> 01:12:55,238
Drink?

1296
01:12:55,319 --> 01:12:56,799
Uh...

1297
01:12:56,878 --> 01:12:57,959
yeah.

1298
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:00,318
Rye whiskey?

1299
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:02,560
Boy, you writers.
Work hard, play hard.

1300
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,441
That's what I hear, anyway.
Lou!

1301
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:08,682
Anyway, Ben Geisler tells me things
are going along great.

1302
01:13:08,762 --> 01:13:11,042
Says we got a real winner
in this one.

1303
01:13:11,122 --> 01:13:13,443
I'll tell you something.
I'm counting on it.

1304
01:13:13,523 --> 01:13:16,124
I've taken an interest.
Nothing to fear, mind you.

1305
01:13:16,203 --> 01:13:18,044
Hardly seems necessary in your case...

1306
01:13:18,085 --> 01:13:20,444
a writer,
a storyteller of your stature.

1307
01:13:20,485 --> 01:13:22,846
Give it to me
in bold strokes, Bart.

1308
01:13:22,886 --> 01:13:24,446
Give me the broad outlines.

1309
01:13:24,486 --> 01:13:26,886
I'm in the audience,
the lights go down,

1310
01:13:26,926 --> 01:13:28,287
Capitol logo comes up.

1311
01:13:28,327 --> 01:13:30,168
You're on, huh?

1312
01:13:33,768 --> 01:13:35,008
Yeah.

1313
01:13:35,049 --> 01:13:36,649
Uh... okay.

1314
01:13:36,809 --> 01:13:37,889
Huh?

1315
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:40,930
Well, uh...

1316
01:13:42,051 --> 01:13:43,371
we... we fade in...

1317
01:13:43,451 --> 01:13:44,931
Uh-huh.

1318
01:13:46,772 --> 01:13:49,733
It's... It's a tenement building
on the Lower East Side.

1319
01:13:49,812 --> 01:13:51,693
Great!
He's poor, this wrestler.

1320
01:13:51,733 --> 01:13:53,253
He's had to struggle, huh?

1321
01:13:55,174 --> 01:13:56,374
And then...

1322
01:13:56,375 --> 01:13:57,415
Uh-huh?

1323
01:13:57,494 --> 01:13:59,095
Well, uh...

1324
01:14:01,615 --> 01:14:03,656
Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnick?

1325
01:14:03,696 --> 01:14:06,537
Can you?
Jesus, you damn well better be!

1326
01:14:06,577 --> 01:14:08,858
If I wasn't honest
in my business dealings...

1327
01:14:08,938 --> 01:14:10,779
Well, you can't always be honest,

1328
01:14:10,858 --> 01:14:13,099
not with the sharks
swimming around this town.

1329
01:14:13,179 --> 01:14:14,579
If I'd been totally honest,

1330
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:16,500
I wouldn't be near this pool

1331
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:17,940
unless I was cleaning it.

1332
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,741
But that's no reason
for you not to be.

1333
01:14:20,821 --> 01:14:23,061
Honest, I mean.
Not cleaning the pool.

1334
01:14:25,983 --> 01:14:27,022
Oh.

1335
01:14:28,703 --> 01:14:29,743
Uh-huh.

1336
01:14:36,225 --> 01:14:38,105
To be honest, uh...

1337
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:39,546
I'm never really comfortable

1338
01:14:39,586 --> 01:14:41,507
discussing work in progress.

1339
01:14:41,586 --> 01:14:44,307
I got it all worked out in my head,

1340
01:14:44,388 --> 01:14:47,788
but sometimes,
if you force it into words...

1341
01:14:47,868 --> 01:14:49,788
prematurely...

1342
01:14:49,869 --> 01:14:51,229
uh, the wrong words...

1343
01:14:51,269 --> 01:14:52,669
Well, your meaning changes,

1344
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:56,790
and it changes in your own mind,
and you never get it back,

1345
01:14:56,871 --> 01:15:00,592
so I'd... I'd just as soon
not talk about it.

1346
01:15:05,513 --> 01:15:07,393
Mr. Fink... never mind me.

1347
01:15:07,473 --> 01:15:09,714
Never mind how long
I've been in pictures.

1348
01:15:09,794 --> 01:15:11,314
Mr. Lipnick's been in pictures

1349
01:15:11,395 --> 01:15:13,115
about since they was invented.

1350
01:15:13,155 --> 01:15:14,515
He practically invented them.

1351
01:15:14,595 --> 01:15:16,076
I think if he's interested

1352
01:15:16,156 --> 01:15:18,837
in what one of
his contract employees is doing,

1353
01:15:18,916 --> 01:15:21,637
that employee
should be able to tell him

1354
01:15:21,718 --> 01:15:25,118
if he wants to stay an employee.

1355
01:15:25,158 --> 01:15:27,999
Right now,
the contents of your head

1356
01:15:28,038 --> 01:15:30,559
are the property
of Capitol Pictures.

1357
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:33,241
If I was you...

1358
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,681
I would speak up.

1359
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,761
And pretty goddamn fast.

1360
01:15:40,042 --> 01:15:46,244
You lousy kike...
son of a bitch.

1361
01:15:46,283 --> 01:15:48,484
You're telling this man...
this artist...

1362
01:15:48,524 --> 01:15:49,965
what to do?

1363
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:51,325
Mr. Lipnick, I...

1364
01:15:51,405 --> 01:15:52,885
He creates for a living!

1365
01:15:52,966 --> 01:15:55,886
Thank him, you son of a bitch,
or you're fired!

1366
01:15:55,966 --> 01:15:58,287
Mr. Lipnick,
that's really not necessary.

1367
01:15:58,367 --> 01:16:00,967
Get down on your knees,
you son of a bitch!

1368
01:16:01,048 --> 01:16:02,327
Kiss this man's feet!

1369
01:16:02,328 --> 01:16:04,329
Mr. Lipnick, please.

1370
01:16:04,408 --> 01:16:05,729
Kiss this man's feet!

1371
01:16:11,091 --> 01:16:13,291
Get out of here!
You understand me?

1372
01:16:13,331 --> 01:16:17,732
You're out of here. You're fired.
Get out of my sight.

1373
01:16:24,934 --> 01:16:25,854
I...

1374
01:16:25,934 --> 01:16:27,053
I apologize, Barton.

1375
01:16:27,054 --> 01:16:29,415
No. Mr. Breeze actually
has been a great help.

1376
01:16:29,496 --> 01:16:32,856
You don't have to cover for him.
That's very noble.

1377
01:16:32,936 --> 01:16:35,337
I'd feel much better
if you'd just reconsider.

1378
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:38,057
If that son of a bitch
won't apologize to you,

1379
01:16:38,138 --> 01:16:39,978
then goddamn it, I will.

1380
01:16:40,058 --> 01:16:42,379
I respect your artistry
and your methods.

1381
01:16:42,459 --> 01:16:43,859
If you can't fill us in yet,

1382
01:16:43,939 --> 01:16:47,820
hell, we should be kissing your feet
for your fine efforts.

1383
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:50,621
You know...

1384
01:16:54,142 --> 01:16:56,982
in the old country,
we were taught as young children

1385
01:16:57,023 --> 01:16:59,623
that there's no shame
in supplicating yourself

1386
01:16:59,703 --> 01:17:01,223
when you respect someone.

1387
01:17:01,304 --> 01:17:03,264
On behalf of Capitol Pictures,

1388
01:17:03,344 --> 01:17:06,745
the administration,
and all of the stockholders,

1389
01:17:06,825 --> 01:17:08,706
please accept this

1390
01:17:08,745 --> 01:17:11,987
as a symbol of
our apology and respect.

1391
01:17:38,033 --> 01:17:40,194
Barton, can I come in?

1392
01:17:52,397 --> 01:17:55,198
Jesus... you're leaving?

1393
01:17:55,278 --> 01:17:58,199
Have to, old-timer,
just for a little while.

1394
01:17:58,278 --> 01:17:59,919
Jesus.

1395
01:17:59,999 --> 01:18:01,119
Charlie, I...

1396
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,800
Everything's okay, believe me.

1397
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,720
I know it's rough mentally,

1398
01:18:04,801 --> 01:18:07,081
but everything's been taken care of.

1399
01:18:07,121 --> 01:18:09,801
Charlie, I got no one else here.

1400
01:18:09,882 --> 01:18:14,323
You're the only person
I know in Los Angeles

1401
01:18:14,403 --> 01:18:18,084
that I...
that I can talk to.

1402
01:18:25,366 --> 01:18:26,686
I feel like I'm...

1403
01:18:26,767 --> 01:18:30,088
like I'm losing my mind,
like I'm going crazy.

1404
01:18:30,167 --> 01:18:32,448
I don't know what to do.

1405
01:18:32,528 --> 01:18:35,409
I didn't do it, believe me.

1406
01:18:35,489 --> 01:18:37,329
I... I'm sure of that, Charlie.

1407
01:18:37,369 --> 01:18:40,210
You got to get a grip on, brother.

1408
01:18:40,249 --> 01:18:43,091
You got to carry on till I get back.

1409
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:45,891
Try and stay here.
Don't talk to anyone.

1410
01:18:45,972 --> 01:18:47,972
We got to keep our heads,

1411
01:18:48,052 --> 01:18:49,852
and we'll figure it out.

1412
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:50,932
Okay, but...

1413
01:18:50,933 --> 01:18:51,892
Don't argue.

1414
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:55,214
You asked me to believe you and I do.

1415
01:18:55,294 --> 01:18:56,695
Now, don't argue with me.

1416
01:18:56,734 --> 01:19:01,015
Look, pal,
can you do something for me?

1417
01:19:01,056 --> 01:19:03,817
Keep that for me
till I get back.

1418
01:19:03,896 --> 01:19:05,656
It's just a lot of personal stuff,

1419
01:19:05,697 --> 01:19:08,537
but I don't want
to drag it with me.

1420
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:09,818
Funny, huh?

1421
01:19:09,858 --> 01:19:12,699
When everything
that's important to a guy,

1422
01:19:12,739 --> 01:19:15,579
everything he wants to keep
from a lifetime,

1423
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:20,381
and he can fit it all
into a little box like that.

1424
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,622
I guess...

1425
01:19:22,661 --> 01:19:24,862
I guess it's pretty pathetic.

1426
01:19:24,902 --> 01:19:27,102
It's more than I've got.

1427
01:19:28,142 --> 01:19:29,543
Well, keep it for me.

1428
01:19:29,583 --> 01:19:31,463
Maybe it'll bring you good luck.

1429
01:19:31,504 --> 01:19:33,384
It'll help you finish your script.

1430
01:19:33,464 --> 01:19:35,785
You'll think about me.
Make me your wrestler.

1431
01:19:35,865 --> 01:19:37,706
Then you'll lick that story.

1432
01:19:37,785 --> 01:19:38,945
Thanks, Charlie.

1433
01:19:38,946 --> 01:19:40,306
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1434
01:19:40,386 --> 01:19:43,187
I'll see you soon, friend.
You'll be fine.

1435
01:19:43,267 --> 01:19:44,588
And you'll be back?

1436
01:19:44,667 --> 01:19:46,547
Don't worry about that, compadre.

1437
01:19:46,628 --> 01:19:48,148
I'll be back.

1438
01:22:38,113 --> 01:22:40,434
You read the Bible, Pete?

1439
01:22:42,395 --> 01:22:43,995
Holy Bible?

1440
01:22:46,236 --> 01:22:47,476
Yeah.

1441
01:22:48,836 --> 01:22:50,396
Yeah, I think so.

1442
01:22:51,677 --> 01:22:53,717
Anyway, I've heard about it.

1443
01:23:07,361 --> 01:23:08,442
Fink?

1444
01:23:08,521 --> 01:23:09,642
Yeah.

1445
01:23:09,721 --> 01:23:11,402
Detective Mastrionotti.

1446
01:23:11,483 --> 01:23:13,243
Detective Deutsch.

1447
01:23:13,282 --> 01:23:14,523
L.A.P.D.

1448
01:23:14,603 --> 01:23:15,844
Uh-huh.

1449
01:23:15,923 --> 01:23:18,244
Got some questions
we want to ask you.

1450
01:23:18,324 --> 01:23:20,925
Just routine.
Sit down.

1451
01:23:21,005 --> 01:23:23,126
What do you do, Fink?

1452
01:23:24,926 --> 01:23:26,446
I... I write.

1453
01:23:26,526 --> 01:23:28,327
Oh, yeah?
What kind of writing?

1454
01:23:28,406 --> 01:23:30,887
As a matter of fact,
I write for the pictures.

1455
01:23:30,968 --> 01:23:32,328
Big fucking deal.

1456
01:23:32,408 --> 01:23:34,368
Should my partner
kiss your ass?

1457
01:23:34,448 --> 01:23:35,808
I didn't mean to sound...

1458
01:23:35,889 --> 01:23:37,249
What did you mean?

1459
01:23:37,289 --> 01:23:39,810
I got respect
for working guys like you.

1460
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:41,770
Jesus, ain't that a load off.

1461
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,171
You live in 621?

1462
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:44,290
Yeah.

1463
01:23:44,371 --> 01:23:45,451
How long?

1464
01:23:45,531 --> 01:23:47,092
A week. Eight, nine days.

1465
01:23:47,171 --> 01:23:48,452
This multiple choice?

1466
01:23:48,532 --> 01:23:50,853
You know this slob?

1467
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:02,295
Yeah, he lives next door to me.

1468
01:24:02,376 --> 01:24:03,736
That's right, Fink.

1469
01:24:03,816 --> 01:24:06,417
He lives next door to you.

1470
01:24:06,497 --> 01:24:08,777
You ever talk to him?

1471
01:24:08,818 --> 01:24:10,178
Once or twice.

1472
01:24:10,258 --> 01:24:12,738
His name is Charlie Meadows.

1473
01:24:12,818 --> 01:24:14,659
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.

1474
01:24:14,738 --> 01:24:17,060
His name's Mundt.
Karl Mundt.

1475
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:18,980
Also known as Madman Mundt.

1476
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:21,340
A little funny in the head.

1477
01:24:21,421 --> 01:24:22,781
What did he...

1478
01:24:22,861 --> 01:24:25,662
He likes to ventilate people
with a shotgun

1479
01:24:25,742 --> 01:24:27,182
and cut their heads off.

1480
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:28,622
Yeah, he's funny that way.

1481
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:30,904
Started in Kansas City.
Couple of housewives.

1482
01:24:30,983 --> 01:24:33,304
We got the same M.O. in Los Feliz.

1483
01:24:33,384 --> 01:24:35,224
Doctor.
Ear, nose, and throat man.

1484
01:24:35,305 --> 01:24:36,665
All of which is missing.

1485
01:24:36,745 --> 01:24:38,105
Well, some throat was there.

1486
01:24:38,186 --> 01:24:39,585
Physician, heal thyself.

1487
01:24:39,666 --> 01:24:41,746
Good luck with
no fucking head.

1488
01:24:41,786 --> 01:24:44,186
Hollywood precinct finds
another stiff yesterday

1489
01:24:44,187 --> 01:24:45,507
not too far from here.

1490
01:24:45,588 --> 01:24:48,068
This one's better-looking
than the doc.

1491
01:24:48,148 --> 01:24:50,389
Female Caucasian,
about 30 years old,

1492
01:24:50,428 --> 01:24:51,869
nice tits, no head.

1493
01:24:51,909 --> 01:24:54,268
Ever see Mundt with anyone
fits that description?

1494
01:24:54,269 --> 01:24:57,310
But, you know,
with the head still on.

1495
01:24:58,471 --> 01:25:01,311
No, I never saw him
with anyone else.

1496
01:25:01,352 --> 01:25:04,192
So you did talk to Mundt.
What about?

1497
01:25:04,272 --> 01:25:05,753
Nothing, really.

1498
01:25:05,832 --> 01:25:08,673
He said he was
in the insurance business.

1499
01:25:08,754 --> 01:25:10,593
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.

1500
01:25:10,674 --> 01:25:13,435
No reputable company
would hire a guy like that.

1501
01:25:13,515 --> 01:25:14,754
That's what he said.

1502
01:25:14,755 --> 01:25:16,036
What else?

1503
01:25:18,275 --> 01:25:20,516
I'm trying to think.

1504
01:25:20,596 --> 01:25:23,357
Nothing, really. He...

1505
01:25:23,397 --> 01:25:28,038
He said he liked
Jack Oakie pictures.

1506
01:25:28,119 --> 01:25:33,040
You know, ordinarily we say
anything you might remember

1507
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,480
could be helpful,

1508
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,401
but I'll be frank with you, Fink.

1509
01:25:37,481 --> 01:25:39,121
That is not helpful.

1510
01:25:39,202 --> 01:25:42,123
Notice how he's not writing it down?

1511
01:25:42,202 --> 01:25:44,243
Fink.

1512
01:25:44,323 --> 01:25:46,524
That's a...

1513
01:25:46,603 --> 01:25:48,724
a Jewish name, isn't it?

1514
01:25:48,804 --> 01:25:49,925
Yeah.

1515
01:25:49,964 --> 01:25:51,484
Yeah.

1516
01:25:51,565 --> 01:25:54,686
I didn't think
this dump was restricted.

1517
01:25:54,765 --> 01:25:57,126
Mundt has disappeared.

1518
01:25:57,166 --> 01:25:59,527
I don't think he'll be back,

1519
01:25:59,566 --> 01:26:03,048
but give me a call
if you see him...

1520
01:26:04,808 --> 01:26:08,529
or if you remember something
that isn't totally idiotic.

1521
01:27:49,516 --> 01:27:50,957
"Fade in.

1522
01:27:50,996 --> 01:27:57,238
Ayoung hussy opens the door...

1523
01:27:57,318 --> 01:28:01,119
to the burlyman's...

1524
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:02,279
apartment.

1525
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,560
If you were a man,

1526
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:08,361
a real man,

1527
01:28:08,401 --> 01:28:10,321
you'd slap me."

1528
01:28:11,522 --> 01:28:15,763
"I put my mark on you first...

1529
01:28:15,803 --> 01:28:19,244
in... delibly."

1530
01:28:29,087 --> 01:28:30,927
"Boardinghouse,

1531
01:28:31,008 --> 01:28:32,286
painted women,

1532
01:28:32,287 --> 01:28:34,168
and the burlyman..."

1533
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:35,568
"Why'd you arrest him?"

1534
01:28:35,649 --> 01:28:39,530
"With one lightning move
with his mighty arms,

1535
01:28:39,610 --> 01:28:40,729
the burlyman..."

1536
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:42,090
"She's a good woman..."

1537
01:28:42,170 --> 01:28:46,851
"I don't care what people say..."

1538
01:28:46,932 --> 01:28:50,412
"So, Burlyman,
we have to deduct those expenses

1539
01:28:50,493 --> 01:28:52,253
from your personal..."

1540
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:56,413
"Don't you care for me
after all these years?"

1541
01:28:56,494 --> 01:28:58,815
Hold the line, sir.
I have your call.

1542
01:28:58,894 --> 01:29:01,736
Hello, operator!
I can't...

1543
01:29:01,815 --> 01:29:04,256
Oh, God.

1544
01:29:06,617 --> 01:29:07,776
Ahem. Hello?

1545
01:29:07,777 --> 01:29:09,177
Garland, it's me.

1546
01:29:09,217 --> 01:29:10,458
Barton?

1547
01:29:10,498 --> 01:29:12,418
Wh-What time is it?

1548
01:29:12,459 --> 01:29:13,819
Are you all right?

1549
01:29:13,899 --> 01:29:15,259
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

1550
01:29:15,339 --> 01:29:17,660
I have to talk to you, Garland.

1551
01:29:17,699 --> 01:29:19,100
I'm calling long-distance.

1552
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:21,501
What is it, Barton?
Are you okay?

1553
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:22,981
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland,

1554
01:29:23,021 --> 01:29:24,382
but we have to talk.

1555
01:29:24,421 --> 01:29:26,342
It's about what I'm writing.

1556
01:29:26,382 --> 01:29:27,902
I think...

1557
01:29:27,982 --> 01:29:29,463
it's really...

1558
01:29:30,663 --> 01:29:32,543
I think it's really big.

1559
01:29:32,584 --> 01:29:34,384
What do you mean, Barton?

1560
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,825
Not big in the sense of large,

1561
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:38,265
although it's that, too.

1562
01:29:38,345 --> 01:29:40,065
I... I mean important.

1563
01:29:40,106 --> 01:29:42,946
This may be
the most important work

1564
01:29:42,986 --> 01:29:44,387
I've ever done.

1565
01:29:44,427 --> 01:29:46,707
Barton, is everything okay?

1566
01:29:46,787 --> 01:29:49,028
You sound a little, um...

1567
01:29:49,068 --> 01:29:51,348
Sound a little what?

1568
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:53,509
You sound a little, um...

1569
01:29:53,549 --> 01:29:55,429
Thanks, Garland.

1570
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:57,670
Thanks for all the encouragement.

1571
01:30:00,151 --> 01:30:01,432
Nitwit.

1572
01:31:02,927 --> 01:31:04,048
Whoo!

1573
01:31:04,128 --> 01:31:05,649
You're cute.

1574
01:31:31,655 --> 01:31:34,055
Excuse me, buddy.
Mind if I cut in?

1575
01:31:34,136 --> 01:31:36,976
This is my dance, sailor.

1576
01:31:37,057 --> 01:31:40,537
Hey, come on, buddy.
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

1577
01:31:40,618 --> 01:31:42,658
I'm a writer

1578
01:31:42,698 --> 01:31:45,379
celebrating the completion
of something good.

1579
01:31:45,459 --> 01:31:47,580
Do you understand that, sailor?

1580
01:31:47,659 --> 01:31:49,340
Beat it, creep.

1581
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,741
Come on, buddy,
give the navy a dance.

1582
01:31:51,821 --> 01:31:53,541
Let somebody else spin the dame.

1583
01:31:53,621 --> 01:31:55,302
Step aside, four eyes!

1584
01:31:55,341 --> 01:31:56,862
4-F, take a hike!

1585
01:31:56,942 --> 01:31:58,662
Go sit on a tomato.

1586
01:31:58,743 --> 01:32:01,503
I'm a writer, you monsters!

1587
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:02,704
I create!

1588
01:32:02,783 --> 01:32:04,624
I create for a living!

1589
01:32:04,704 --> 01:32:06,505
I'm a creator!

1590
01:32:06,584 --> 01:32:07,944
I am a creator!

1591
01:32:08,025 --> 01:32:09,065
Screwy!

1592
01:32:09,146 --> 01:32:11,666
This is my uniform.

1593
01:32:11,746 --> 01:32:14,546
This is how I serve the common man!

1594
01:32:14,627 --> 01:32:16,147
This is where I...

1595
01:32:17,587 --> 01:32:19,188
Get 'em, boys!

1596
01:32:57,198 --> 01:32:58,559
"He left this morning.

1597
01:32:58,638 --> 01:33:01,440
Said he had a job to do.

1598
01:33:01,519 --> 01:33:04,520
There was something in his eyes,

1599
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:06,280
something new.

1600
01:33:06,361 --> 01:33:09,642
What's to become of him?"

1601
01:33:12,562 --> 01:33:15,723
We'll be hearing
from that crazy wrestler,

1602
01:33:15,803 --> 01:33:18,644
and I don't mean a postcard.

1603
01:33:18,724 --> 01:33:20,524
Fade out.

1604
01:33:20,604 --> 01:33:21,804
The end."

1605
01:33:23,525 --> 01:33:25,406
I thought you said
you were a writer.

1606
01:33:25,446 --> 01:33:28,607
I don't know, Duke.
I kind of liked it.

1607
01:33:28,646 --> 01:33:31,247
Keep your filthy eyes
off of that.

1608
01:33:32,487 --> 01:33:34,528
You made the morning papers, Fink.

1609
01:33:34,608 --> 01:33:36,929
Second one of
your friends to die.

1610
01:33:37,008 --> 01:33:39,329
You do get around, don't you?

1611
01:33:39,409 --> 01:33:41,890
You didn't tell us
you knew the dame.

1612
01:33:41,970 --> 01:33:44,611
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?

1613
01:33:44,651 --> 01:33:46,172
Give you nosebleeds?

1614
01:33:47,051 --> 01:33:48,931
Just tell me one thing.

1615
01:33:49,012 --> 01:33:50,852
Where'd you put the heads?

1616
01:33:50,932 --> 01:33:53,093
Charlie.

1617
01:33:53,133 --> 01:33:54,654
Charlie's back.

1618
01:33:54,733 --> 01:33:56,134
No kidding, bright boy.

1619
01:33:56,213 --> 01:33:58,775
We smelled Mundt all over this.

1620
01:33:58,854 --> 01:34:00,454
Was he the idea man?

1621
01:34:00,495 --> 01:34:01,895
Tell us where the heads are.

1622
01:34:01,975 --> 01:34:03,895
Maybe they'll go easy on you.

1623
01:34:03,976 --> 01:34:05,256
Only fry you once.

1624
01:34:05,336 --> 01:34:07,017
Come back later.
It's too hot.

1625
01:34:07,056 --> 01:34:08,297
My head's killing me.

1626
01:34:08,377 --> 01:34:10,257
All right, forget the heads.

1627
01:34:10,337 --> 01:34:11,658
Where's Mundt, Fink?

1628
01:34:11,738 --> 01:34:13,098
He teach you how to do it?

1629
01:34:13,138 --> 01:34:14,858
You two have some sick sex thing?

1630
01:34:14,939 --> 01:34:15,819
Sex?

1631
01:34:15,899 --> 01:34:17,259
He's a man.

1632
01:34:17,339 --> 01:34:19,220
We wrestled.

1633
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:23,821
You're a sick fuck, Fink.

1634
01:34:23,861 --> 01:34:26,062
Charlie's back.

1635
01:34:26,142 --> 01:34:27,502
It's hot.

1636
01:34:27,542 --> 01:34:28,423
He's back.

1637
01:34:52,669 --> 01:34:54,309
Fred.

1638
01:34:59,831 --> 01:35:01,391
Sit tight, Fink.

1639
01:35:06,793 --> 01:35:09,834
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?

1640
01:35:11,434 --> 01:35:12,474
Duke.

1641
01:35:39,721 --> 01:35:41,242
Mundt!

1642
01:35:45,803 --> 01:35:46,883
Mundt!

1643
01:35:46,923 --> 01:35:49,084
Show yourself.

1644
01:36:09,849 --> 01:36:11,530
There's a boy, Mundt.

1645
01:36:13,530 --> 01:36:15,371
Put the policy case down

1646
01:36:15,411 --> 01:36:17,131
and your mitts in the air.

1647
01:36:26,573 --> 01:36:27,894
He's complying.

1648
01:36:32,375 --> 01:36:34,776
Look upon me!

1649
01:36:34,856 --> 01:36:37,777
I'll show you the life of the mind!

1650
01:36:37,857 --> 01:36:39,858
Aah!

1651
01:36:39,937 --> 01:36:41,618
Aah!

1652
01:36:41,657 --> 01:36:44,018
Aah! Look upon me!

1653
01:36:44,058 --> 01:36:47,979
Aah! I'll show you
the life of the mind!

1654
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:50,540
I'll show you the life of the mind!

1655
01:36:50,620 --> 01:36:52,341
I'll show you the life of the mind!

1656
01:36:52,421 --> 01:36:56,182
I will show you the life
of the mind!

1657
01:36:57,262 --> 01:36:59,063
Aah!

1658
01:37:23,228 --> 01:37:25,270
Heil, Hitler.

1659
01:37:25,309 --> 01:37:28,470
Aah!

1660
01:37:37,993 --> 01:37:39,193
Barton.

1661
01:37:42,194 --> 01:37:44,634
Brother, is it hot.

1662
01:37:45,955 --> 01:37:47,636
How you been, buddy?

1663
01:37:49,315 --> 01:37:52,117
Well, don't look at me like that.

1664
01:37:52,196 --> 01:37:54,877
It's just me... Charlie.

1665
01:37:54,917 --> 01:37:56,358
I hear it's Mundt.

1666
01:37:56,398 --> 01:37:59,358
Madman Mundt?

1667
01:37:59,439 --> 01:38:01,679
Jesus, people can be cruel.

1668
01:38:01,759 --> 01:38:05,720
If it's not my build,
it's my personality.

1669
01:38:11,322 --> 01:38:13,963
They say I'm a madman, Bart,

1670
01:38:14,042 --> 01:38:16,563
but I'm not mad at anyone.

1671
01:38:16,643 --> 01:38:17,964
Honest, I'm not.

1672
01:38:18,043 --> 01:38:21,484
Most guys I just feel sorry for.

1673
01:38:21,564 --> 01:38:23,405
It tears me up inside

1674
01:38:23,485 --> 01:38:26,286
to think about what
they're going through,

1675
01:38:26,365 --> 01:38:28,686
how trapped they are.

1676
01:38:29,727 --> 01:38:31,607
I understand it.

1677
01:38:32,687 --> 01:38:34,447
I feel for them.

1678
01:38:36,889 --> 01:38:39,729
So I try and help them out.

1679
01:38:39,770 --> 01:38:40,970
Jesus.

1680
01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:43,891
Yeah.

1681
01:38:43,970 --> 01:38:45,570
Yeah.

1682
01:38:45,651 --> 01:38:47,972
I know what it feels like

1683
01:38:48,051 --> 01:38:50,372
when things get all balled up

1684
01:38:50,452 --> 01:38:51,813
at the head office.

1685
01:38:51,892 --> 01:38:54,373
They put you through hell, Barton.

1686
01:38:55,733 --> 01:38:58,134
So I help people out.

1687
01:39:00,534 --> 01:39:04,456
I just wish someone
would do as much for me.

1688
01:39:05,977 --> 01:39:08,937
Jesus, it's hot.

1689
01:39:12,498 --> 01:39:14,298
Sometimes it gets so hot

1690
01:39:14,378 --> 01:39:17,780
I want to crawl
right out of my skin.

1691
01:39:17,819 --> 01:39:20,980
But, Charlie, why me?

1692
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:22,100
Why...

1693
01:39:22,141 --> 01:39:25,621
Because you don't listen!

1694
01:39:33,144 --> 01:39:34,784
Jesus.

1695
01:39:34,864 --> 01:39:36,425
I'm dripping again.

1696
01:39:39,385 --> 01:39:41,626
Come on, Barton,

1697
01:39:41,665 --> 01:39:44,667
you think you know pain?

1698
01:39:45,987 --> 01:39:49,148
You think I made your life hell?

1699
01:39:50,428 --> 01:39:51,748
Look around this dump.

1700
01:39:51,828 --> 01:39:54,669
You're just a tourist
with a typewriter.

1701
01:39:54,749 --> 01:39:57,510
I live here.
Don't you understand that?

1702
01:40:04,031 --> 01:40:06,873
And you come into my home...

1703
01:40:08,913 --> 01:40:10,753
and you complain

1704
01:40:10,793 --> 01:40:14,594
that I'm making too much noise.

1705
01:40:25,678 --> 01:40:27,558
I'm sorry.

1706
01:40:34,359 --> 01:40:36,400
Don't be.

1707
01:41:22,053 --> 01:41:25,013
I'll be next door
if you need me.

1708
01:41:28,854 --> 01:41:30,135
Oh...

1709
01:41:30,175 --> 01:41:32,575
I dropped in on
your folks in New York.

1710
01:41:32,655 --> 01:41:35,536
And Uncle Maury.

1711
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:36,936
Good people.

1712
01:41:43,018 --> 01:41:45,858
By the way,
that package I gave you...

1713
01:41:45,899 --> 01:41:47,379
I lied.

1714
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:49,380
It isn't mine.

1715
01:42:50,836 --> 01:42:52,116
Fink.

1716
01:42:52,197 --> 01:42:53,557
Samuel or Lillian Fink.

1717
01:42:53,637 --> 01:42:54,997
85 Fulton Street.

1718
01:42:55,077 --> 01:42:56,478
Or Uncle Maury.

1719
01:42:56,558 --> 01:42:59,278
I understand that,
but there's still no answer.

1720
01:42:59,318 --> 01:43:00,238
Mr. Fink?

1721
01:43:00,279 --> 01:43:03,119
Shall I check for trouble
on the line?

1722
01:43:08,761 --> 01:43:10,921
Fink.

1723
01:43:11,002 --> 01:43:12,281
Mr. Lipnick.

1724
01:43:12,362 --> 01:43:14,683
Colonel Lipnick...
if you don't mind.

1725
01:43:14,762 --> 01:43:15,962
Sit down.

1726
01:43:16,043 --> 01:43:18,162
I was commissioned yesterday
in the army reserve.

1727
01:43:18,163 --> 01:43:20,763
Henry Morgenthau arranged it.
Dear friend.

1728
01:43:20,844 --> 01:43:22,684
Congratulations.

1729
01:43:22,724 --> 01:43:23,884
It hasn't officially
gone through yet.

1730
01:43:23,885 --> 01:43:25,245
Had wardrobe whip this up.

1731
01:43:25,325 --> 01:43:27,206
Got to pull teeth
to get anything done.

1732
01:43:27,286 --> 01:43:29,407
Can understand
red tape in peacetime,

1733
01:43:29,486 --> 01:43:31,486
but now it's all-out warfare
against theJaps.

1734
01:43:31,567 --> 01:43:34,168
They'd love to see me
sit this one out.

1735
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:36,608
Yes, sir.
They, uh...

1736
01:43:36,688 --> 01:43:40,169
Anyway, I had Lou
read your script for me.

1737
01:43:40,249 --> 01:43:42,570
I got to tell you, Fink...

1738
01:43:42,650 --> 01:43:44,211
it won't wash.

1739
01:43:44,290 --> 01:43:45,329
With all due respect,

1740
01:43:45,330 --> 01:43:47,491
I think it's
the best work I've done.

1741
01:43:47,571 --> 01:43:48,810
Don't gas me, Fink.

1742
01:43:48,811 --> 01:43:52,612
If your opinion mattered,
I'd let you run the studio.

1743
01:43:52,693 --> 01:43:55,132
The lunatics aren't going to run
this particular asylum.

1744
01:43:55,133 --> 01:43:57,774
Let's put a stop
to that rumor right now.

1745
01:43:57,894 --> 01:43:59,934
Yes, sir.

1746
01:43:59,975 --> 01:44:01,495
Had to call Beery this morning,

1747
01:44:01,575 --> 01:44:04,135
tell him we were pushing
the picture back.

1748
01:44:04,175 --> 01:44:06,016
After all I told him about quality,

1749
01:44:06,056 --> 01:44:07,296
about that Barton Fink feeling,

1750
01:44:07,377 --> 01:44:08,697
how disappointed we were.

1751
01:44:08,777 --> 01:44:11,577
Wally was heartbroken.
The man was devastated.

1752
01:44:11,658 --> 01:44:13,978
I didn't actually call him.
Lou did.

1753
01:44:14,058 --> 01:44:16,659
That's a fair description,
isn't it, Lou?

1754
01:44:16,739 --> 01:44:17,738
Yes, Colonel.

1755
01:44:17,739 --> 01:44:21,060
I could take you
through it step-by-step,

1756
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:22,980
explaining why
your story stinks,

1757
01:44:23,021 --> 01:44:25,341
but I won't insult
your intelligence.

1758
01:44:25,421 --> 01:44:26,421
Well, all right.

1759
01:44:26,421 --> 01:44:28,702
First of all,
this is a wrestling picture.

1760
01:44:28,782 --> 01:44:31,903
The audience wants to see action,
adventure, wrestling.

1761
01:44:31,983 --> 01:44:35,143
They don't want to see a guy
wrestling with his soul.

1762
01:44:35,224 --> 01:44:36,704
All right, some for the critics.

1763
01:44:36,784 --> 01:44:39,145
You make it the carrot
that wags the dog.

1764
01:44:39,185 --> 01:44:40,945
Too much,
they head for the exits.

1765
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:43,826
There's plenty of poetry
inside that ring, Fink.

1766
01:44:43,906 --> 01:44:46,027
Look at Hell 10 Feet Square.

1767
01:44:46,067 --> 01:44:47,307
Blood, Sweat, and Canvas.

1768
01:44:47,347 --> 01:44:48,547
Blood, Sweat, and Canvas.

1769
01:44:48,548 --> 01:44:51,388
These are big movies,
Fink, about big men.

1770
01:44:51,468 --> 01:44:52,308
In tights!

1771
01:44:52,389 --> 01:44:54,709
Both physically
and mentally...

1772
01:44:54,749 --> 01:44:56,429
especially physically.

1773
01:44:56,469 --> 01:44:58,991
We don't put Wally Beery
in a fruity movie about suffering.

1774
01:44:59,030 --> 01:45:01,791
I thought we were
together on that.

1775
01:45:03,031 --> 01:45:05,272
I'm sorry if I let you down.

1776
01:45:05,352 --> 01:45:07,312
You didn't let me down
or even Lou.

1777
01:45:07,353 --> 01:45:10,033
We don't live or die
by what you scribble.

1778
01:45:10,073 --> 01:45:11,314
You let Ben Geisler down.

1779
01:45:11,353 --> 01:45:13,234
He liked you,
trusted you.

1780
01:45:13,273 --> 01:45:15,194
That's why he's gone.
He's fired.

1781
01:45:15,234 --> 01:45:17,075
That man had a big heart.

1782
01:45:17,114 --> 01:45:18,354
You fucked him.

1783
01:45:18,355 --> 01:45:20,436
He tried to convince me
to fire you, too,

1784
01:45:20,476 --> 01:45:21,876
but that'd be too easy.

1785
01:45:21,916 --> 01:45:23,797
You're under contract.
You'll stay that way.

1786
01:45:23,836 --> 01:45:26,236
Anything you write is
property of Capitol Pictures.

1787
01:45:26,237 --> 01:45:29,078
Capitol Pictures won't produce
anything you write...

1788
01:45:29,118 --> 01:45:31,518
not until you
grow up a little.

1789
01:45:31,599 --> 01:45:33,919
You ain't no writer, Fink.

1790
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:36,320
You're a goddamn write-off.

1791
01:45:37,961 --> 01:45:41,121
I... I tried to show you...

1792
01:45:41,161 --> 01:45:42,521
something beautiful.

1793
01:45:44,482 --> 01:45:46,403
Something about all of us.

1794
01:45:46,443 --> 01:45:47,483
I...

1795
01:45:47,523 --> 01:45:51,164
You arrogant
son of a bitch.

1796
01:45:51,204 --> 01:45:53,484
You think
you're the only writer

1797
01:45:53,565 --> 01:45:55,926
that can give me
that Barton Fink feeling?

1798
01:45:56,005 --> 01:45:58,405
I got 20 writers
under contract

1799
01:45:58,486 --> 01:46:01,247
I can ask for
a Fink-type thing from!

1800
01:46:01,286 --> 01:46:02,607
You swell-headed hypocrite.

1801
01:46:02,687 --> 01:46:03,888
You don't get it.

1802
01:46:03,967 --> 01:46:05,247
You think the whole world

1803
01:46:05,248 --> 01:46:06,769
revolves around
whatever rattles

1804
01:46:06,848 --> 01:46:09,809
inside that little
kike head of yours.

1805
01:46:09,889 --> 01:46:12,370
Get him out of my sight, Lou!

1806
01:46:12,450 --> 01:46:14,130
I want him in town, though.

1807
01:46:14,210 --> 01:46:15,610
He's still under contract.

1808
01:46:15,691 --> 01:46:19,691
I want you in town
and out of my sight.

1809
01:46:19,732 --> 01:46:21,812
Now, get lost.

1810
01:46:21,892 --> 01:46:23,412
There's a war on.

1811
01:47:19,267 --> 01:47:21,588
It's a beautiful day.

1812
01:47:21,628 --> 01:47:22,708
Huh?

1813
01:47:28,670 --> 01:47:31,511
I said it's a beautiful day.

1814
01:47:31,551 --> 01:47:32,831
Yes.

1815
01:47:32,911 --> 01:47:34,591
It is.

1816
01:47:37,152 --> 01:47:39,033
What's in the box?

1817
01:47:40,874 --> 01:47:42,674
I don't know.

1818
01:47:43,914 --> 01:47:45,634
Isn't it yours?

1819
01:47:50,596 --> 01:47:52,596
I don't know.

1820
01:47:58,278 --> 01:48:00,398
You're very beautiful.

1821
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Are you in pictures?

1822
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:10,041
Don't be silly.
