1
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,022
Yo, Maurice!

2
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,429
Jackie-Jack!

3
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,300
How you doin'?

4
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,930
And Miss lovely Amber Waves.

5
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,105
You haven't been around.

6
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,110
We were on vacation.

7
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,271
Don't ever stay away
from my club that long again.

8
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,541
You got it.

9
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:55,707
And not for nothing, honey...

10
00:01:55,748 --> 00:02:00,208
but you are the sexiest bitch
here, and I love you!

11
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,379
Such a charmer.

12
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:05,755
I got your booth
set up in the back.

13
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,226
I'm ready, I'm available.

14
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:11,424
You put me in a movie,
we're talking box office.

15
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,021
G.G.!

16
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,066
Jack and Amber's table...

17
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:20,129
take them over
an order of clams.

18
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,540
How's it going here?

19
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,374
It's gonna be me and you.
We'll take a picture later on.

20
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,970
I love you, baby.

21
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,174
How's it goin'?

22
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:36,119
I was looking for you.
Where were you?

23
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,351
I was here.

24
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,489
I love you back.

25
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,397
Hey, Maurice, cowboy.

26
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,922
That's the cowboy?

27
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,234
You like it?

28
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,739
Yeah, if you like it.

29
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,673
I love it!

30
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,512
Compliments of Maurice.

31
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,742
- Thank you.
- Can I get a margarita?

32
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,374
A 7-UP.

33
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,817
Hi, Rollergirl.

34
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,585
Did you call that girl today?

35
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,091
I forgot.

36
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,926
If you don't do it tomorrow,
you'll never see her.

37
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,398
What's the matter down there?

38
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,957
I gotta go pee.

39
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,491
Well, go then.

40
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,454
Hey, Little Bill.

41
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,052
Hi, Amber. How are you?

42
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,826
How's our schedule? Are we
still on for day after tomorrow?

43
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,197
More like the day after
the day after tomorrow.

44
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:32,227
Come on. I gotta call
Rocky and Scotty and Kurt.

45
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,797
It's going to be
a small group on this one.

46
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,173
- A low-key deal?
- Exactly.

47
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,272
Do we... I'm sorry.

48
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,543
Do we have a script?

49
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,807
How you doin'?

50
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,212
Fine.

51
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,046
How old are you?

52
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,348
I have a work permit.
I have all the papers.

53
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,980
Not that.
Been working here long?

54
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,990
A month.

55
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,288
Maurice give you the job?

56
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,730
You from around here?
Canoga? Reseda?

57
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,164
You know where Torrance is?

58
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,565
How do you get here?

59
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,125
Take the bus.

60
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,962
What do you want to be?

61
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,234
Excuse me?

62
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:45,734
You take the bus to Reseda
for this job.

63
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,178
Can't you get a job
like this in Torrance?

64
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:51,377
Yeah, but I don't want to.

65
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,250
So...

66
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,892
Do you want a five or a ten?

67
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,861
What?

68
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:06,763
If you want to see me jack off,
it's ten...

69
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,199
but if you only want
to look at it, it's five.

70
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,097
Guys pay to watch you do it?

71
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,004
You already done it tonight?

72
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,508
Couple times.

73
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,907
And you can do it again?

74
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,378
If you want.
If you got ten bucks.

75
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,181
My name is Jack.

76
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,243
Eddie. Eddie Adams.

77
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,117
Eddie Adams from Torrance.

78
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,183
I'm Jack Horner, filmmaker.

79
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,749
Really?

80
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:37,559
I make adult films,
exotic pictures.

81
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,725
I know who you are.
I read about you in a magazine.

82
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,758
Inside Amber, Amanda's Ride.
You made those, right?

83
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,326
Those are great.

84
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,601
So, now you know
I'm not full of doggy doo-doo.

85
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,300
Want to come back
to the table and have a drink?

86
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:54,279
I'd love to,
but I have to work.

87
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,873
You have to work,
get money, pay the rent.

88
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,317
I need money,
but I don't pay rent.

89
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,843
I still live at home.

90
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,684
How old are you?

91
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,090
Seventeen.

92
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,762
Seventeen-year-old
piece of gold.

93
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,162
Yeah, right.

94
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,689
Why don't you
come back to the table?

95
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,134
I do know you.
I know who you are.

96
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,606
I'd love to come for a drink,
and you're not full of...

97
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,937
Doggy doo-doo.

98
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:25,876
But I just couldn't walk out
on Maurice. I'm sorry.

99
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,006
I got a feeling
beneath those jeans...

100
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,916
there's something wonderful
just waiting to get out.

101
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,093
Hey, Bill. What's up?

102
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,658
What are you guys doing?

103
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,636
A couple of bad girls.

104
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,104
I guess I'll see you later.

105
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,039
What are you still doing here?

106
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,564
Half hour be OK.

107
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,278
Listen, thank you.

108
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,145
Love you, mamita. Take care.

109
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:06,276
This is the man you let in
any time, understand?

110
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,286
All right.

111
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,787
A luego.

112
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,312
Hasta maana.

113
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,453
Make you some eggs, beauty?

114
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,592
No. I'm going to sleep.
Good night.

115
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,568
Good night, honeytits.

116
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,661
Sleep beautiful.

117
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,902
Tom? It's me.

118
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,638
I know it's late, but I...

119
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,077
Is Andy there?

120
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:15,153
I'd like to say hello to my son,
and that's all.

121
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,121
Let me tell you something
you don't know.

122
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,630
I know a lawyer, you understand?

123
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,828
You think I don't, but I do,
and I'll take you to court!

124
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,670
Don't. Please.

125
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,838
What the fuck are you doing?

126
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,472
What the fuck
does it look like I'm doing?

127
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:44,999
Can you close the door?

128
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,837
Will I close the door?

129
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,743
That's my wife, you asshole.

130
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,216
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:56,949
Get out.

132
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,923
Go sleep on the couch.

133
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,984
Don't stop, big stud.

134
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,683
That's right.

135
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,492
Shave if you're gonna do that.

136
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:16,893
You'll scratch my face.

137
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,191
Sorry.

138
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,497
Morning.

139
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,873
How's that work?
You get home late now?

140
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,348
You work in a nightclub.

141
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,578
If it means so much to you,
find one that's closer.

142
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,614
I gotta get to work.

143
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,285
- A car wash.
- What?

144
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,294
You work at a car wash
and a nightclub.

145
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,228
School never occurred to you?

146
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:12,283
You're getting twice the bass
with the TK-421...

147
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,878
which we've got on this system
right here.

148
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,084
I don't know
if I need all that bass.

149
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,684
I think you need all that bass.

150
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:24,287
If you want a system
to handle what you want...

151
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,695
you need the bass.

152
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:30,832
This is hi-fi, OK?

153
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,498
High fidelity.

154
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,631
You know what that means?

155
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,107
That means this is
the highest quality fidelity.

156
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:40,202
Hi-fi. Two very important
things in a stereo system.

157
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,538
It's the price for the...

158
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,016
I have this very unit
in my home.

159
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,985
Really?

160
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,045
But I got it modified
with the TK-421...

161
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,956
which kicks it up another...

162
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:58,157
three or four quads per channel.

163
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,926
But that's technical talk.

164
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:01,796
That doesn't really concern you.

165
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,402
Still a little uncertain,
aren't you?

166
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,832
You know what you need?
You need a test drive.

167
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,808
That's what you need.

168
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,038
It's one thing to hear it
from Buck's mouth.

169
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,444
It's another thing to hear it
from the TK-421.

170
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,506
So let me just pop in
this 8-track...

171
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,608
and you just give a listen,
tell me what you think.

172
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:26,583
You hear that?

173
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,559
You hear the bass? Right?

174
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,824
You hear it? It kicks.

175
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,491
It turns.
It curls up your belly.

176
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,625
Makes you want
to freaky-deaky, right?

177
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:38,637
You got that?
If you get this system as is...

178
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,606
it won't sound like this without
the TK-421 modification...

179
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,098
and we do that in the store,
very small price.

180
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,578
Move with it if you need to.
It helps me.

181
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:50,975
Thank you for your time.

182
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,044
So long, pardner.

183
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,745
What the fuck was that?

184
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,520
Have I told you?

185
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,220
I don't know
what you're talking about.

186
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:05,526
With that country-western shit,
no one's going to buy a stereo.

187
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,226
What kind of brother are you,
listening to that shit?

188
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,997
Look, Jerry...

189
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:14,130
I gave you a job here because
I thought your acting stuff...

190
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,970
might bring some nice pussy
into the place...

191
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,569
and it has, but I can't have
any more fuckups.

192
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:20,771
You dig?

193
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,406
- You dig?
- Yeah, I dig.

194
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,011
Now get in the back
and unload those new 484s.

195
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,544
All right. Sorry.

196
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,716
Settle down, class.

197
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,227
This is your final.

198
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:40,994
Keep your test papers facedown
until I tell you to turn them.

199
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,001
Clear your tables, please.

200
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,003
There should be nothing
on your desk...

201
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,505
but your test paper
and a pencil.

202
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:52,499
We're covering chapters
seventeen through twenty-eight.

203
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:56,503
Your eyes should stay
on your test papers, please.

204
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,846
Are we ready?

205
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,181
Class, begin.

206
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,492
Honey?

207
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,463
You OK?

208
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,022
Sweetheart?
Is something wrong?

209
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,067
I got to get back.

210
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,594
I need it once more.

211
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,106
I have to go back to work.

212
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,005
Come on. Give it to me.

213
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,771
Don't make me pounce you,
Sheryl Lynn.

214
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,079
- I'll do it.
- You promise?

215
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:03,479
That's it!

216
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,039
- You want it?
- Yeah.

217
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,847
- How bad?
- Bad.

218
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:08,580
- You sure?
- Yeah.

219
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,110
You asked for it!

220
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,451
Oh, God. Wait.

221
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,894
Stop.

222
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,928
What?

223
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,839
Your cock is so beautiful.

224
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,979
Do you know
how good you are doing it?

225
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,981
Having sex? Fucking me?

226
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,607
Making love to me?

227
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,487
Everyone has one thing,
you think?

228
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,990
I mean, everyone's given
one special thing, right?

229
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,355
That's right.

230
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,223
Everyone's blessed
with one special thing.

231
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,562
I want you to know
I plan on being a star.

232
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,435
A big, bright shining star.

233
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,444
That's what I want.

234
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,446
That's what I'm going to get.

235
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,947
I know.

236
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,142
I got to go.

237
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,248
Get lucky.

238
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,162
Want a ride?

239
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,397
I'm going really far.

240
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:45,205
Do you remember me
from a couple hours ago?

241
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,404
I remember.

242
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,312
Come with us, sweetie.

243
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,216
This is a really cool car.

244
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,997
What I'm trying to tell you...

245
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:12,993
is it takes a lot of the good
old American green stuff...

246
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,734
to make one of these things.

247
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,670
You've got your camera...

248
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:22,009
you got your film,
you got your lights...

249
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,880
your sound, your lab costs,
your developing...

250
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:28,010
your synching, and your editing.

251
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,214
Before you turn around,
you spent maybe $20,000...

252
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:33,520
$25,000, $30,000 on a movie.

253
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,253
That's a lot of money.

254
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,285
You bet your ass it is...

255
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,092
but if you make a good one...

256
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,532
there's practically no end
to how much money you can make.

257
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,159
Have you seen Jack's house?

258
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:46,670
- No.
- He will.

259
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:47,865
He'll see it.

260
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,038
You got maybe fifteen,
twenty guys standing around...

261
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:55,535
just making sure
that your lighting is right.

262
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,014
But you can work out
in the morning...

263
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,951
you can work out at noon,
you can work out at night.

264
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,945
Doesn't matter if you don't
have those juices flowing...

265
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,324
down there in the Mr. Torpedo
area, in the fun zone.

266
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,955
But you got to get
the people in the theater.

267
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,966
You need the big dicks,
the big tits.

268
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,968
Here we go.

269
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,869
How do you keep them in
the theater after they've come?

270
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,666
With beauty...

271
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,369
and with acting.

272
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:30,848
I understand you've got
to get them in the theater.

273
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,679
You got to keep
the seats full...

274
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,982
but I don't want
to make a film...

275
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,614
where they show up, sit down,
jack off...

276
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,489
and get up and get out
before the story ends.

277
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,993
It is my dream, it is my goal...

278
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:50,833
it is my idea to make a film
that the story sucks them in...

279
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,997
and when they spurt out
that joy juice...

280
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,337
they just got to sit in it.

281
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:02,439
They can't move until they
find out how the story ends.

282
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:07,441
I want to make a film
like that.

283
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,954
And I understand
they have to make films.

284
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:13,446
I've made them myself
that are a few laughs...

285
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,460
everybody fucks
their brains out...

286
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,462
and that's fine...

287
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,464
but it's my dream...

288
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,658
to make a film...

289
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,963
that is true...

290
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:26,800
and right...

291
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,499
and dramatic.

292
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,303
You sure
you don't want a Fresca?

293
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,744
- No, thanks.
- Are you sure?

294
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,714
You're out of limes.

295
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,375
Check in the kitchen.

296
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:44,481
I'm going to bed.
Good night, Jackie.

297
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,491
Don't stay up too late.

298
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,015
Good night, beauty.

299
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,957
Good night, Eddie.

300
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,588
Glad you came by.

301
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:55,992
You're great.

302
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,524
Thank you.

303
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,968
She's the best.

304
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:07,445
She's a wonderful mother.

305
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:10,448
She's a mother
to all those who need love.

306
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,882
She's really nice.

307
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,947
You know what I'm thinking?

308
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:20,446
I'm thinking I want to be
in business with you.

309
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,461
- Really?
- Yeah. What do you think?

310
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,826
I'd love it.

311
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,132
What do you think of Rollergirl?

312
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,964
She's great.

313
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:32,970
Would you like to do it?

314
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,973
- Have sex?
- Oh, yeah.

315
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,975
I'd love to.

316
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,476
She's really foxy.

317
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,479
You bet your ass she is.

318
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,481
You're officially
out of limes, Jack.

319
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,983
I'll pick up
some for you tomorrow.

320
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:49,475
Come here, darling.
I want you to go over there...

321
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,489
and sit on the couch with Eddie.

322
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,981
Here we go.
Are we going to fuck?

323
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,017
Wait a minute.

324
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,840
Are you ready?

325
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,310
Yeah. Are you?

326
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:20,117
Are you going
to take your skates off?

327
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,641
I don't take my skates off...

328
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,822
and don't fucking come in me.

329
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,556
Aim it at her tits, Eddie.

330
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:54,978
Where were you?

331
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,488
- Nowhere.
- Shut up.

332
00:25:57,522 --> 00:26:00,719
You see that little slut girl
you see?

333
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,420
Sheryl? Sheryl Lynn?

334
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,927
Don't say that.

335
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,954
Make you feel like a stud
to see trash like that?

336
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,024
Is she your girlfriend?

337
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,036
She's not my girlfriend.

338
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,937
She's a little whore
and a little piece of trash...

339
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,533
and I know you're not
the only one she sees.

340
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,100
Why would you say something
like that?

341
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,408
I heard things about her.

342
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,539
Don't think I don't know
what goes on when I'm not here.

343
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,948
I wash your sheets.
I know she's been here.

344
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:27,952
Or you doing something else
in there...

345
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:30,420
with your music
and your posters on the wall?

346
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,389
What is your problem?

347
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,618
OK. Fine.

348
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,455
Go to that little whore
Sheryl Lynn.

349
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,961
- Why don't you go to her?
- Maybe I will.

350
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,464
What are you going to do?

351
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,125
I don't know.
I'll do something.

352
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,464
You can't do anything!

353
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,061
You'll always be a loser!

354
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,096
You couldn't finish high school
because you were too stupid!

355
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,438
- What are you going to do?
- I'll do something!

356
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:52,807
I'll go somewhere,
and I'll do something!

357
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,334
Maybe I'll run away
where you can never find me!

358
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,244
Go ahead!
Fuck that little girl!

359
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,408
What do you think you're doing?

360
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,580
- I'm getting my stuff.
- You think that's your stuff?

361
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,591
That's not your stuff!
You didn't pay for it!

362
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,423
That is not your stuff
because you didn't pay for it!

363
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,929
None of this is yours!

364
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:15,592
You leave here,
you leave with what you've got!

365
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,363
Nothing!

366
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,204
You understand me?

367
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:21,933
You want to treat me
like this?

368
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,703
This is what happens!
Is that fair?

369
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,678
- I didn't do anything!
- You want to live that way?

370
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,442
You think
you're going to do this?

371
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,779
Goddamn poster!

372
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,944
Don't do that!
Why are you doing that?

373
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:38,114
You're not going to be shit,
because you're too stupid!

374
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,215
- I'm not stupid!
- Yes, you are!

375
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:41,953
Please! Don't fucking do that!

376
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,961
Please don't be mean to me!

377
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,725
I'm not being mean to you.
You're too stupid to see it!

378
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,960
You don't know
what I could do...

379
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,968
what I'm going to do,
what I'm going to be.

380
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,162
You don't know. I'm good.

381
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:53,795
I have good things
you don't know about...

382
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,533
and I'm going to be something!
I am!

383
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,871
Don't fucking tell me I'm not!

384
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:01,242
Don't be mean!
And you don't talk to me!

385
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,439
Fuck!

386
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,926
Eddie Adams from Torrance.

387
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,428
I knew you'd make it.

388
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,431
You take the bus
the whole way here?

389
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:21,955
It wasn't bad.

390
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,095
Great. I got some people
I want you to meet.

391
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:33,944
You like music?

392
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,377
- I love music.
- What kind?

393
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:38,439
All kinds of music...
rock, jazz, classical.

394
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,451
I want you to meet
a couple of great people...

395
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:41,952
Buck and Becky.

396
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,783
I'm Eddie Adams.

397
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,619
Buck Swope. Nice to meet you.

398
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,955
- Our new fella.
- Becky Barnett.

399
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:51,291
- It's nice to meet you.
- This is the new fella?

400
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:55,095
- Is that a faccia?
- That is a faccia.

401
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,760
- Faccia's "face," right?
- That's right.

402
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,893
- Nice to meet you guys.
- All right.

403
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,801
Great people.

404
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,604
He's one hell of an actor.

405
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,610
Hey, Reed. Reedo!

406
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:12,411
I want you to meet the new boy
on the street... Eddie Adams.

407
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,917
I'm Eddie.

408
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,249
Reed Rothchild.

409
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:17,413
I want you to stick around
for a while, OK?

410
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:18,922
Sure.

411
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,926
- Make him something special.
- Aye, aye.

412
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,259
- You live on this street?
- No.

413
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,127
I thought Jack
just said you did.

414
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:30,762
- Want a drink?
- Sure.

415
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,100
- Margarita?
- Great.

416
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,696
Wow.

417
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,443
Two, four...

418
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:40,944
whatever.

419
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,781
Can I ask you something?

420
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,683
Do you work out?

421
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,450
You look like it.
What do you squat?

422
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,956
About two.

423
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,458
Super, super.

424
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:58,155
What about you?
What do you squat?

425
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,129
- 350.
- Wow.

426
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,965
- It's no B.S.
- That's a lot.

427
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:08,131
- Where do you work out?
- In Torrance, where I live.

428
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:09,470
Cool.

429
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,975
Do you ever go to Vince's
out here?

430
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,171
No, I would have seen you.
I'm there every day.

431
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,703
I've always wanted to work out
at Vince's.

432
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,909
Cool. Here. Taste that.

433
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,713
- Rock and roll.
- All right?

434
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,994
Did you ever see that movie
Star Wars?

435
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,496
About four times.

436
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,998
People tell me
I look like Han Solo.

437
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,364
Really?

438
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,663
What do you bench?

439
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,695
You tell first.

440
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,334
I asked you first.

441
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,706
Same time.

442
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:48,004
Cool.

443
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,172
Are you ready?

444
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,340
Ready.

445
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:53,350
One... two... three...

446
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:56,046
- You didn't say anything.
- Neither did you.

447
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,447
Hey, guys. Look at me.

448
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,530
Thank you, Johnny.

449
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,633
My dear, it's party time.

450
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:22,043
Do you look lovely?

451
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,809
Hello, Colonel. How are you?

452
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,645
This is my lady friend.

453
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,984
Darling, I'd like you
to meet Jack Horner...

454
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,990
the finest director
in the business.

455
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,992
Do you have any coke
at this party?

456
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,994
I'm sure they can find some
somewhere.

457
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,495
Great.

458
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,657
You're no bigger
than a minute, are you?

459
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,098
Shy as a butterfly, I'll bet.

460
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,007
He doesn't have the right
to tell me how to dress.

461
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,738
Baby, it's just plain old.

462
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,006
Wait. Let me tell you something.

463
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,606
First, he was obviously
pissed off about the music.

464
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,207
What's wrong with it?

465
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,150
Second, the cowboy look
ended about six years ago.

466
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:04,621
- It's coming back.
- No, it's not. It's dead.

467
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,590
I don't think you know
what you're talking about.

468
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,785
I know what I'm talking about...

469
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:11,294
and it sounds like your bosses
are saying the same thing.

470
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:15,459
- What?
- You have to get a new look.

471
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,967
You get a new look.

472
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:19,469
I have a look, OK?
The look I have is just fine.

473
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:22,473
- What's your look?
- Chocolate love.

474
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:23,974
Take a pill.

475
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,805
You don't have to lash out
like that.

476
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,435
I'm just trying
to be your friend.

477
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:30,208
I tried opening up a club
there...

478
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:33,775
but I'm just this poor fellow
from Puerto Rico.

479
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:35,979
I got this club here.
That's one thing.

480
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,853
But soon that goes,
I die, and what do I have?

481
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,551
I got nothing.

482
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:43,219
I want something
I can send home.

483
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:47,891
Something I can send my brothers
and say, "Look at me...

484
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:51,732
and all the beautiful women
I've been with."

485
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,498
So, what?
You want me to talk to Jack?

486
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,506
Yeah. I mean, you know.

487
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,008
What am I asking you here?

488
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,442
Honey, Amber, baby,
please talk to Jack.

489
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,174
Tell him I can do this.
Tell him I won't be bad.

490
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,841
You want to be in a movie?

491
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:07,146
- Baby, please.
- I'll see what I can do.

492
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:10,951
Would you, love?
Thank you very much.

493
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,479
Thank you, mamita.

494
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,756
Maurice, can I talk to you?

495
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,455
I need to talk to you now.

496
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,963
Pal, buddy...

497
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,659
Excuse me.

498
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,633
Can I join in?

499
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,965
Most certainly.

500
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,971
The cowboy look,
that's not dead.

501
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,973
What is Becky talking about?

502
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,975
She's got a fucking
something up her ass.

503
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,842
- Fuck that shit.
- Bitch.

504
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:52,989
Do a cannonball!

505
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,022
No. Watch this jackknife.

506
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:04,433
- Did it look cool?
- Pretty good.

507
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,772
Let me show you
what you did wrong.

508
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,980
Full flip.

509
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:39,966
You all right?

510
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:43,640
You got to bring your legs
all the way around.

511
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:46,343
I know. I know.

512
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,976
This is my point.

513
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,548
You know what I say?
Wear what you dig.

514
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:57,494
Just wear what you dig.

515
00:34:57,528 --> 00:35:00,122
- That's what I say.
- What's the problem?

516
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,225
Should I get that?

517
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,440
Can you speak
a little louder, please?

518
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:13,205
Who? Maggie.

519
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:14,438
- Do you know a Maggie?
- I don't know a Maggie.

520
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,344
Sorry.
There's no Maggie here.

521
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,281
Your mother.

522
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,444
Just give me a second.

523
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,046
Watch that for me, OK?

524
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:29,460
Excuse me.
Is there a Maggie here?

525
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,325
Maggie? Are you Maggie?

526
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:36,155
Do you know Maggie?

527
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,735
You Maggie?

528
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:43,869
Can you believe this?

529
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,977
I'm sorry.
There's no Maggie here.

530
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,980
OK. No. It's not a problem.

531
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:51,481
Ciao.

532
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:52,983
Who was that?

533
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,713
Some kid looking for his mom.

534
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,027
What the fuck are you doing?

535
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:46,969
What's it look like
they're doing?

536
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:49,973
- That's my wife.
- Shut up, Bill.

537
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:52,475
You're embarrassing me.

538
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,671
Yeah, Little Bill. Shut up.

539
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:09,926
Hey, Kurt. How's it going?

540
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,258
What's wrong?

541
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:12,922
My fucking wife.

542
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,592
She's down there,
some idiot's dick in her.

543
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,430
Everybody's standing around
watching.

544
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:18,935
It's a fucking embarrassment!

545
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:22,269
Yeah, I know. Anyway, listen.

546
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:23,967
For the shoot,
I want to talk about the look.

547
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:26,476
I want to see about
getting this new zoom lens.

548
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,411
I was wondering if we'd get
some more lights, too.

549
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:30,971
Jack wants a minimal thing.

550
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:33,882
Very often, minimal means
a lot more photographically...

551
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,546
than most people understand.

552
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,078
- I understand.
- I know you understand.

553
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,249
I'm talking about
some other people.

554
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,953
I think what Jack
is talking about is minimal...

555
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:45,963
not really natural, but minimal.

556
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,591
- I was just saying...
- I understand.

557
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,965
Because I'm trying to give
each picture its own look.

558
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,970
Can we talk about this later?

559
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,336
Oh, yeah.
You got to go somewhere?

560
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,701
I was hoping
for the shoot tomorrow...

561
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:05,079
we could send Rocky down,
and he could pick it up.

562
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,414
No, hey. Got you.
You got to go somewhere...

563
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,419
so what the fuck?
It's only the photography...

564
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,421
of the film we're talking about.

565
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,423
Are you giving me shit?

566
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,254
Hey, no way, Little Bill.

567
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,421
My wife has an ass
in her cock in the driveway!

568
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,930
I'm sorry if my thoughts
are not on the photography...

569
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,933
of the film
we're shooting tomorrow, OK?

570
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,935
OK. No big deal. Sorry.

571
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,437
- All right?
- Got you.

572
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,976
All right. Where is this?

573
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,656
I think she's sick.

574
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,665
What the fuck is this?

575
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,963
I didn't do anything.
I didn't.

576
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,468
Is she breathing?

577
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,402
I don't know.
I think she did too much coke.

578
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,803
Do you think so, Doctor?

579
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,397
This girl's definitely OD'd.

580
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:07,741
I want you to handle this
for me, Johnny.

581
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,076
Pick her up, get her in the car,
and drive her to Saint Joe's.

582
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:12,082
Drop her off in the front.

583
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,050
Got you.

584
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,417
Make sure no one sees the limo.

585
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,115
What the fuck is this?

586
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:21,852
This is twice in two days
that a chick has OD'd on me.

587
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:26,261
Do you think maybe
you ought to get some new shit?

588
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:29,232
Shit. She's freaking out!

589
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,426
See? Look at this.

590
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,436
With all this fucking
conversation. Come on.

591
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,960
Please don't die!

592
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:36,940
Come on!

593
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,541
Back door, Johnny.

594
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:42,443
You got it.

595
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,710
Fuckin' shit!

596
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,151
Get out of my way.

597
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:55,087
- Is she all right?
- Shut the fuck up!

598
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,489
Hey, Scotty J. How are you?

599
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:31,052
You know, you know. Who's this?

600
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,824
Eddie, this is Scotty J.
He's a friend.

601
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,160
He works on some of the films.

602
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:36,826
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, yeah. Me, too.

603
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,994
You going to be working or...

604
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:40,401
Maybe.

605
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,463
Probably.

606
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:44,667
That's great.
How'd you meet Jack?

607
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:47,006
Because I work on the films
sometimes.

608
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,978
So if you ever...

609
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,815
Come here a second, will you?

610
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:57,014
Could you excuse me
for a minute?

611
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,453
Very nice to meet you.

612
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,649
Take care.

613
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,792
Eddie Adams,
this is the Colonel.

614
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,458
How do you do?

615
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:10,763
Eddie is interested in film.

616
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,962
I can't give you much advice...

617
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,971
that Jack probably
doesn't know...

618
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:17,269
but I can advise that maybe
you think about your name.

619
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,468
My name?

620
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,535
Think about some name
that makes you happy...

621
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,479
or something
with a little pizzazz.

622
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,175
Sure.

623
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:29,983
The Colonel here puts up
all the money for our films.

624
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,284
It's an important part
of the process.

625
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,722
Great.

626
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,486
I'm looking forward
to seeing you in action.

627
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:36,823
Jack says you got
a great big cock.

628
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,489
I don't know. I guess so.

629
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,499
- May I see it?
- Really?

630
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:43,693
Please.

631
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,508
Thank you, Eddie.

632
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,009
No problem.

633
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,510
Thanks, Eddie.

634
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,035
All right.

635
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,000
You want to hear a poem
I wrote?

636
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:30,469
I love you, you love me...

637
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:33,483
going down the sugar tree.

638
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,985
We'll go down the sugar tree...

639
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,488
and see lots of bees...

640
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:41,980
playing, playing.

641
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:44,494
But the bees won't sting...

642
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,496
because you love me.

643
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,997
That's it.

644
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:50,000
That's fucking great.
Did you write that?

645
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:53,003
- I write songs, too.
- Wow.

646
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:55,505
How's it going, boys?

647
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,507
Having a good time?

648
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,008
Excellent time.
Thank you, Jack.

649
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,944
- It was a great party.
- The best.

650
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,812
That's what
Jackie's house is for.

651
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:05,940
- Right?
- That's right!

652
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,041
Coming in.

653
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,786
How about
a little bubbles, Reed?

654
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:20,327
Excuse me, Jack.

655
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:24,300
I'm thinking about what
the Colonel said about my name.

656
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:25,768
I was just wondering
if you had any ideas.

657
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:27,464
I had some thoughts on it.

658
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:29,369
What about you?
What do you think?

659
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:32,967
My idea was
I just want a name...

660
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,945
I want it so it can cut glass,
like razor-sharp.

661
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,413
Razor-sharp. Right.

662
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,473
When I close my eyes,
I see this thing.

663
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:40,983
It's this big sign...

664
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:44,215
and the name
is in bright blue neon lights...

665
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:45,482
with purple outline...

666
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:48,491
and this name is just so bright
and so sharp...

667
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:54,088
that the sign blows up
because the name's so powerful.

668
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,968
It says, "Dirk Diggler."

669
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:11,944
I think Heaven has
sent you here, Dirk Diggler.

670
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:16,442
I think the angels have blessed
us all because of you.

671
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,749
You're Dirk!

672
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,380
Amen.

673
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,629
Talk to me, Kurt.

674
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,135
- Twenty to thirty.
- Why?

675
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,467
I got a couple of
tough shadows to deal with.

676
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,496
There's shadows in life, babe.

677
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:42,135
You want to go over this?

678
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,807
The setup is... Here we go.

679
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,817
One, Amber talking to Becky.

680
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,819
They make the telephone
call to the agents...

681
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,650
to send over some actors.

682
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,987
Two, enter Reed
to audition for Amber.

683
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,992
They go at it. Becky watches.

684
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,995
Three, Becky goes
to the bathroom to jack off.

685
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:02,430
She gets interrupted by Amber.
They go at it.

686
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:03,956
Four...

687
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:07,429
Who's Dirk Diggler?

688
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:10,201
That's that new boy,
good-Iooking kid...

689
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,764
Eddie at the club.

690
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,606
Good name.

691
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,942
Anyway, enter Dirk.
He meets Becky. They go at it.

692
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:17,606
Change that, will you?

693
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,946
I want Eddie to be auditioning
for Amber.

694
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,473
Got it.

695
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,450
Darling, where are you going?

696
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:26,285
I got to go wash my vagina.

697
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:27,950
How long will you be?

698
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:30,221
Two seconds.
You want it clean, don't you?

699
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,294
I'm back now.

700
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:37,493
I'm ready to start.

701
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:50,474
I'm supposed
to come get you now...

702
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:52,505
and tell you
that they're all ready now.

703
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:59,853
Do you think you could
give me a minute?

704
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:03,782
Thanks.

705
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,931
I'm back now.

706
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:11,298
I'm ready to start
my acting career.

707
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:22,305
That's right.

708
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:32,455
- You look really good.
- Thank you.

709
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:34,457
And you look really sexy.

710
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:35,981
Thanks.

711
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:44,459
- I like your name a lot.
- You do?

712
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:47,163
- It's really cool.
- Thanks.

713
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:53,499
You'll be right down there.

714
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,117
Thanks.

715
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:05,921
How's my boy?

716
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:10,416
- Great. Let's do it.
- All right.

717
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,428
Remember everything
we talked about?

718
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,930
Now, you're going
to come through the door...

719
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,262
walk right over here.

720
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,428
I'll say, "Action, Eddie."

721
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:21,437
That will be your cue, right?

722
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:23,439
You come through the door...

723
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:27,739
you walk right over to
the desk to Amber, and we shoot.

724
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,439
Do we go right into
the sex or...

725
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:31,447
Is that all right?

726
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:33,472
Is it OKwith you?

727
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,451
Good.

728
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:40,456
You don't need a rehearsal?

729
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,958
No. It's OK. I can do it.

730
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:44,961
Then we'll shoot the rehearsal.

731
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:47,122
- Great.
- All right.

732
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:48,927
Could I ask you something?

733
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:53,630
Can you call me
Dirk Diggler from now on?

734
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,797
- Absolutely.
- Great.

735
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,137
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

736
00:47:58,175 --> 00:47:59,437
From now on.

737
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:00,909
Let's get a good one.

738
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:03,412
Do you want to practice
your lines with me?

739
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:04,914
No. I know it.

740
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,416
- You look great, honey.
- Thanks.

741
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:10,420
Does he want me to keep going
until I come?

742
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,422
Yeah. You just come
when you're ready.

743
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:14,424
Where should I do it?

744
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:17,086
- Where do you want?
- Wherever you tell me.

745
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:19,425
Come on my tits if you can, OK?

746
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:22,432
Just pull it out and do it
on my stomach and my tits.

747
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:24,127
Yeah. No problem.

748
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:30,633
Are you all right, honey?

749
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:32,437
This is great. I'm fine.

750
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,444
I just want to do good.

751
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,446
I just want it to be
really good.

752
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,948
Is it OK if I really try
to make it look sexy?

753
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:41,450
Would that be OK?

754
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:42,816
Great.

755
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:48,151
You ready?

756
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,455
You're going to enter
through this door right here.

757
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:54,453
He'll call "Action."
You got the lines for the scene?

758
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:56,966
If you drop one, just call
for it, but do not stop, OK?

759
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,194
You want some water
or something?

760
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:00,203
- No. I'm fine. Thanks.
- You're going to do fine.

761
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,270
Roll it, Scotty.

762
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,908
Speed.

763
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,410
Sticks.

764
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,934
Marker.

765
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,915
Camera's set.
We're ready, chief.

766
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,941
And...

767
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,945
Action, Dirk.

768
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,088
Hello. Are you John?

769
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,127
Your agency recommends you
very highly.

770
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,692
I'm a really hard worker...

771
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:35,261
and if you give me a job,
I won't disappoint you.

772
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,273
What special skills do you have?

773
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,434
I've been in the Marines
for three years.

774
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,944
I just got back
from a tour of duty.

775
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,447
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.

776
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:48,440
It got really hard being
surrounded by guys all day.

777
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,112
How long has it been
since you've had a woman?

778
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,621
- A long time.
- That's terrible.

779
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:57,454
But I'm back and ready
to pursue my acting career.

780
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,462
As you may or may not know...

781
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,464
this is an important film
for me.

782
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,467
If it's not a hit, I'll get
kicked out of my apartment.

783
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:07,265
- My landlord's a real jerk.
- Really?

784
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:08,794
Why don't you
take your pants off?

785
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,307
It's important
I get an idea of your size.

786
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,501
No problem.

787
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:46,504
I think that you have the job...

788
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:49,034
but why don't I make sure
of something?

789
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,381
This is a giant cock.

790
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,481
We've rolled out.

791
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,715
We got to change mags.

792
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,851
Do it quickly.

793
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,493
- Kids.
- Is everything cool?

794
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:53,503
It's going great.
We just got to change the angle.

795
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,505
Does it look sexy?

796
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:57,507
It's great.

797
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:59,509
You're doing so good, Dirk.

798
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:01,272
Does it feel good?

799
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:10,953
Roll sound, Scotty.

800
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:15,818
Speed.

801
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,693
Quiet. Sticks.

802
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,398
Marker.

803
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:26,959
We're back.

804
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:29,096
Action, kids.

805
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:33,973
We're going to go down now.

806
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,774
No. Do it again.

807
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:47,447
John, you're a wonderful actor.

808
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:17,453
You're amazing.

809
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:19,955
- You feel so good, Amber.
- You ready to come?

810
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:23,451
- Come in me.
- What?

811
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:24,960
Don't worry. I'm fixed.

812
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:26,986
I want you to come in me.

813
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:38,838
Oh, God.

814
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:46,004
Wonderful.

815
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:48,977
Cut. Terrific!

816
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:50,509
Nice work!

817
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:54,980
That's great!
Wasn't that sexy?

818
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:56,492
Rock and roll!

819
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:57,993
Really good.

820
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:00,929
- Looked great. Very sexy.
- Doesn't he fuck like a champ?

821
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,693
- He rocked.
- Thanks, Reed.

822
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:05,758
- The camera loves you.
- We didn't get the come shot.

823
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:08,930
We missed the come shot.
He came inside her.

824
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,440
Maybe we could go
to stock footage or...

825
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:14,773
Are you crazy?
It won't match.

826
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:19,715
I could do it again
if you need a close-up.

827
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,988
Here we go!

828
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:30,916
Everyone say, "Dirk."

829
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:35,455
These are real wood.

830
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,988
I know.

831
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,967
These are the ones.
These are great.

832
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,970
Those are really cool.
Are they lizard?

833
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,598
No. They're Italian.
I'm going to fucking buy these.

834
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,041
Guys!

835
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,376
It's funny you say that,
because we should be in a band.

836
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,482
- You like my shoes?
- They're pretty cool.

837
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:05,653
I got them with Reed and Scotty.
They're cool, huh?

838
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:10,428
They're embossed leather
with this reptilian pattern.

839
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:11,934
Cool.

840
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:13,936
Can we have some hot sauce here?

841
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,438
Hiya, Scotty.
Sit down and help yourself.

842
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:17,940
Thanks.

843
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:19,373
Say hello to Jaimelyn.

844
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,746
- You're a Leo?
- That's right.

845
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:27,977
My girlfriend wants to meet you.

846
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,110
- Is that right?
- This is Raymond.

847
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:31,643
How do you do?
What's your name?

848
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:33,656
- Becky Barnett.
- Excuse me?

849
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:38,760
- Raymond's a Leo.
- I knew it.

850
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:40,387
- What's your sign?
- I'm a Pisces.

851
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,762
What?
I can't deal with no Pisces.

852
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,391
That shirt's pretty sexy, too.

853
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:47,460
This is
imported Italian nylon...

854
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:50,473
and it's a special edition
limited silk print...

855
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:55,467
and it was done by this really
famous design artist.

856
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:56,979
Pick a card.

857
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:59,379
What's up, baby? I love you.
Bitch you later, baby.

858
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,348
What table's that going to?

859
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:02,749
Four? Five, Jose.

860
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:04,344
What's happening, my man?

861
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:07,049
You alive, man.

862
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,421
What's up, people?

863
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:11,427
Rise from the deck.

864
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:12,928
Damn! That's...

865
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:14,429
Two of diamonds, right?

866
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:16,932
That's my card.
That is incredible.

867
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:20,458
Doesn't it make you nervous
dealing with those evil forces?

868
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:23,939
- Horses?
- No. Evil forces.

869
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:25,440
Evil? No, man.

870
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:27,943
It's not evil.
It's an illusion.

871
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:30,775
Yeah, it's confusing.

872
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:32,975
Thank you.

873
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,480
Listen up, kid.

874
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:36,985
We're going to try and do this
all in one shot.

875
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:41,218
We start like this,
and you roll her over, Dirk.

876
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:42,485
Rollergirl,
you roll right over with him...

877
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:46,120
but try to give me every single
position. Is that possible?

878
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:48,892
If you wrap your leg around...

879
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:52,459
The other one, the left leg...
around and over. Good.

880
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,493
See, we can go
right into doggy style.

881
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:55,697
Perfect.

882
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,172
Is the movement of the waterbed
a problem?

883
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:01,575
No, not at all.
I dig it. It's great.

884
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:02,737
OK, can we do this?

885
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,940
All right, everybody,
here we go.

886
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,348
This is going to be great.

887
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:10,284
Do you want me to use
the Spanish accent?

888
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,818
"Jack Horner has found
something special...

889
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:22,093
"in newcomer Dirk Diggler.

890
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:26,124
"Another stellar sexual standout
from Horner and company.

891
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:29,468
"Diggler delivers a performance
worth a thousand hard-ons.

892
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:32,475
His presence when dressed
is powerful and demanding."

893
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,977
"When stripped to the bone...

894
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:38,469
"Diggler's more eruptive
than a volcano on a bad day.

895
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,245
"Amber Waves' ripe cherry lips
do a wonderful job...

896
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,980
of handling Diggler's
wide load."

897
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,012
"And Reed Rothchild's
stiff biceps...

898
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:50,583
do a slapping good job with
Becky Barnett's supple ass."

899
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:52,492
"But Diggler remains
the standout in this film.

900
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,498
"It's easy to predict
that after only two films...

901
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:59,229
that Diggler's suck-cess can
only grow and grow and grow..."

902
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,569
What else?

903
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,974
That's it for now.

904
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,969
Look at the character
Holmes came up with.

905
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:19,709
And look, I just...

906
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:21,148
Tell me.

907
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:23,482
I don't like seeing women
treated that way.

908
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:25,316
This guy he plays, Johnny Wadd...

909
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:27,823
it's always about
slapping some girl around.

910
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:30,325
It's not right. It's not cool.
It's just not sexy.

911
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,828
It's not sexy like it should be.

912
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:35,831
This guy's more
a James Bond type character.

913
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:37,833
You know, he's classy.

914
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:39,732
He's a world-traveled guy.

915
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,327
I like that.

916
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:43,362
Reed could play my partner.

917
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:47,907
I like that a lot.

918
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:49,502
We could make it really good.

919
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:52,514
If you direct it, we make
a series with a whole story.

920
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:54,812
It's exactly
what we've always talked about.

921
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:57,012
Please?

922
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:59,021
When we get back...

923
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:00,920
set up the typewriter.

924
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:03,858
We'll see what comes out of it.

925
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:06,953
I have to talk to the Colonel
when we get to Vegas.

926
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:10,693
And you got to work
on the Colonel, too.

927
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:11,961
You got to be committed.

928
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:15,459
I'll do whatever I have to do.

929
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:18,064
Does this character
have a name?

930
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:22,471
His name is Brock Landers.

931
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:25,447
His partner's name
is Chest Rockwell.

932
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,917
Those are great names!

933
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:34,489
And the award
for best newcomer goes to...

934
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,822
Yes! My baby boy!

935
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,495
And the award
for best cock goes to...

936
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,657
Here we go again.

937
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,668
The award
for best actor goes to...

938
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,297
I've seen all his movies, and
I can't wait to work with him.

939
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:32,470
Wow. I don't know what to say.

940
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:33,982
I guess...

941
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:37,474
Wow. I guess
the only thing I can say...

942
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,420
is I'll promise
to keep rockin' and rollin'...

943
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:40,786
and making better films.

944
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:47,322
It seems we make these movies,
and sometimes, you know...

945
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:49,991
they're considered filthy
or something by some people...

946
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:52,500
but I don't think that's true.

947
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:55,504
These movies we make,
they can be better.

948
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,507
They can help. They really can.
I mean that.

949
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,441
We can always do better.

950
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:03,934
I'm going to keep trying
if you guys keep trying.

951
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,345
Let's keep
rockin' and rollin', man.

952
01:03:21,664 --> 01:03:24,155
Marker.

953
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,497
Set.

954
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:46,121
Shot of tequila, straight up.

955
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:51,059
I've been in this place
for twenty minutes...

956
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:53,391
just to get a seat.

957
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,294
Are you alone?

958
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,458
Yeah. Just visiting L.A.

959
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,697
Some people told me the food
in here was really good.

960
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:02,294
Good? It's not good.

961
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:05,307
It's probably the best place
to eat in Los Angeles.

962
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:08,936
- It's excellent.
- I certainly hope so.

963
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:12,072
I could die of starvation before
I get something in my mouth.

964
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,506
Still hungry?

965
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,509
Starving.

966
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:23,749
Why don't you feast on that?

967
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,839
Oh, it's true.

968
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,501
What's that?

969
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:42,670
You are Brock Landers.

970
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:08,998
Freeze! Don't make me
chase you, Raphael!

971
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:22,507
Freeze!

972
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:38,500
We're almost there.

973
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:41,503
Here's what I want.
I want you to trim the head.

974
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:44,506
Dump that shot of Reed
with the revolver.

975
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,167
And switch the title card.

976
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:49,666
I want it to come flying out
of the screen at the audience.

977
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:51,179
Nice. Piece of cake.

978
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:52,646
That's my guy.

979
01:05:55,551 --> 01:05:58,349
I told him, "This is
a special party for Scotty J.

980
01:05:58,387 --> 01:06:00,719
I want your lightest,
bubbliest champagne."

981
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:01,950
So this is
what he gave me, Scotty.

982
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:04,960
Take a little sip of this
and tell me what you think.

983
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:06,962
This is supposed
to be really good stuff.

984
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:09,464
Here. Take a sip.

985
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:10,965
Isn't that pretty light?

986
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,797
What do you think, huh?

987
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:13,961
Beautiful.

988
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:15,800
Great. Look how spacious it is.

989
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,806
Look, I like this, too.

990
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,808
That's custom-made.
Real imported Italian leather.

991
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:22,470
- Very unusual.
- Watch this.

992
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:25,480
- What's that?
- My initials.

993
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:27,482
That's so imaginative.
How'd you think of that?

994
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:29,484
I was thinking of my name
one day and dreamt it up.

995
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:30,985
How are you?

996
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,487
I'm almost finished.

997
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:33,818
Looks great.

998
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:36,484
I used a little poetic license
to capture your essence.

999
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:37,992
Looks great, Jessie.

1000
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:39,824
It's good for conversation.

1001
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:42,990
Jessie did
that oil painting as well...

1002
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:44,329
and Buck is still installing
the stereo.

1003
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:46,164
- That's a beanbag.
- You're kidding.

1004
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:48,670
And that lamp,
those are real sterling silver.

1005
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:50,672
They have
a very modern feel, too.

1006
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:53,834
This could be the place
you could have conversations.

1007
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:56,344
You ready? Ta-da!

1008
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:57,846
It's my dojo.

1009
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,347
It's all Asian.

1010
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:00,940
You have an Asian dojo.

1011
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:02,951
It has that whole karate feel.

1012
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:04,452
It's very comfortable.

1013
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:06,114
A lot of ancient China.

1014
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:08,282
I have my statues
for my best-actor awards.

1015
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:10,451
A good place
to keep your awards. I'm glad.

1016
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:12,461
Yeah. Look at this.

1017
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:15,964
- Oh, that's handy.
- Can you see yourself?

1018
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:17,329
It's great, huh?

1019
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:20,802
My whole entire wardrobe.

1020
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:22,303
That's great.

1021
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:24,636
It's all perfectly organized
by color and designer.

1022
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:26,971
You don't have to think
about it or anything.

1023
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:28,476
No. It's all ready.

1024
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,978
You're going to love it.

1025
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:31,980
This is my favorite thing
in the whole entire world.

1026
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:33,982
You ready?
Close your eyes, please.

1027
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:35,176
Yeah, baby.

1028
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:43,624
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Oh, God!

1029
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:46,492
This is it.
This is the thing.

1030
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:47,996
You deserve this, baby.

1031
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,827
Isn't it great?

1032
01:07:49,865 --> 01:07:52,333
This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1033
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:55,098
Want to go for a ride?

1034
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:56,934
She rocks!

1035
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,937
You set us up, Chico.

1036
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:08,108
You want to fuck with Raphael
and Ringo, that's your business.

1037
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:09,981
You don't fuck
with Chest and Brock!

1038
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:14,118
You know what?
You're not even worth it!

1039
01:08:14,156 --> 01:08:15,646
I gave you a chance!

1040
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:21,986
I trusted him.

1041
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:26,657
Well, we almost solved the case.

1042
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:30,972
At least the women are safe.

1043
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:33,998
Let's go get some
of that Saturday-night beaver.

1044
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:39,477
No one fucks
with Chest and Brock.

1045
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:42,484
This is the best work
we've ever done.

1046
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:44,509
It's a real film, Jack.

1047
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:47,989
It feels good.

1048
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:49,513
You made it fly.

1049
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:54,985
You know, this is the film...

1050
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:58,090
I want them to remember me by.

1051
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,578
Thank you.

1052
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:31,960
As far as I'm concerned,
it's all about love, you know?

1053
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:35,960
I mean, if you love someone,
how hard can the world be?

1054
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:40,305
People will come and go,
and so will problems...

1055
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:43,641
but ultimately, if you have
got love on your side...

1056
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,476
and it is just...

1057
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:49,041
I mean, it is just deep down
in your soul...

1058
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:51,979
what's a problem going to be...

1059
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:54,512
that takes your attention
away from that?

1060
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,515
Do you understand?

1061
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:00,995
I'm Becky Barnett.

1062
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,998
I'm Jerome.

1063
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,499
Nice to meet you.

1064
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,501
Nice to meet you, too, Becky.

1065
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:08,503
So what do you do?

1066
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:11,665
I'm in the auto industry.

1067
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:14,676
Yeah, I'm a regional manager
over at Pep Boys.

1068
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,678
Oh, wow! That's great.
That's great.

1069
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:20,512
You've got
a really nice smile, Becky.

1070
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:24,007
Thank you... Jerome.

1071
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:38,859
The Colonel.

1072
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,493
Excuse me.

1073
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:42,026
Floyd Gondolli.

1074
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,062
Great you could make it.

1075
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:47,542
How are you? You look happy.

1076
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:49,043
I'm fine.

1077
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,046
Meet boys... Tommy, Pete.

1078
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:54,049
Meet girls... Cyndi, Angie.

1079
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,711
These are the next stars.

1080
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:59,118
These are the real people
in the world.

1081
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:02,650
I think we ought to do that talk
with Jack now.

1082
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:05,159
Maybe iron this thing out
before we start the new year?

1083
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:06,422
Let's do it.

1084
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:08,327
What were you thinking?
What were you feeling?

1085
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:09,854
Did you do research?

1086
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:12,493
What are you
talking about here?

1087
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:13,660
Nothing.

1088
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:15,829
You want to come with me
for a little while?

1089
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:18,499
- Where?
- It's a surprise.

1090
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,007
Yeah. Let's go.

1091
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:21,475
Excuse me, Jessie.

1092
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:52,040
Hey, Buck.

1093
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:54,042
Hey, Jessie.
How you doing?

1094
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:56,442
- You sitting alone?
- Yes.

1095
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:01,983
Todd Parker!

1096
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:03,484
Rockin' Reed Rothchild!

1097
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:07,979
- Aw, you made it!
- Yeah!

1098
01:12:08,023 --> 01:12:10,992
An amazing party, man.
Fuckin' chicks everywhere.

1099
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:12,994
You bet.
Courtesy of Jack Horner.

1100
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:16,828
I wouldn't mind having a piece
of that action over there.

1101
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:18,332
Michelle.
I'll introduce you.

1102
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:20,335
Sure. Introduce her to my lap.

1103
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:22,337
Did you get off work, man?

1104
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:23,838
Don't dance Sunday nights.

1105
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:24,998
Right.

1106
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,008
Whose 'vette is that
out in the driveway?

1107
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:28,509
Dirk. I'm so jealous.

1108
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:30,171
That shit's jammin', man.

1109
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:32,510
Start down low
with a 350 cube...

1110
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:35,016
3.25 horsepower,
4-speed, 4-10 gears...

1111
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:37,518
10 coats of competition orange
hand-rubbed lacquer...

1112
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:39,521
with a dual-plane manifold...

1113
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:41,546
Full fuckin' race cams.

1114
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:53,034
I'm pretty happy with it,
you know.

1115
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,536
It's a great look for you,
I think.

1116
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:58,039
It's pretty original,
you know, I think.

1117
01:12:58,073 --> 01:12:59,563
Right.

1118
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:03,500
Take this off.

1119
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:10,985
What were we talking
about before?

1120
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:14,477
- Oil painting?
- No.

1121
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:16,991
No... Yes.
I mean, but I was saying that...

1122
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:18,492
Oh, sunsets.

1123
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:20,995
Right, yeah.
I was saying I love sunsets.

1124
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:22,496
But sunrises are better.

1125
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:24,021
Exactly.

1126
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:27,331
I thought I was the only one
who felt that way.

1127
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:30,167
- No. I feel that way.
- Really?

1128
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:33,663
Yes, really. Have you ever heard
my stereo system?

1129
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:35,677
I'm going to open
my own business.

1130
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:38,339
- Really?
- Yes.

1131
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,177
It's my dream, OK?

1132
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:45,016
It's hi-fi stereo equipment
at discount prices.

1133
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:48,022
It's called
Buck's Super Stereo World.

1134
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:50,024
That is a fucking great idea.

1135
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:54,518
Yeah. The Eighties,
that's when it's gonna happen.

1136
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:57,532
- Really?
- Really. The 1980s.

1137
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:58,999
Wow.

1138
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:02,470
I wanted you to come in
and give me a minute...

1139
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:04,472
so I could tell you
how much I love you.

1140
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:06,474
I mean, it's going
to be a new year.

1141
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:08,476
We're going to start things
and do things...

1142
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:11,479
and I just wanted you to know
how much I care about you.

1143
01:14:11,513 --> 01:14:13,981
I really care about you, honey.
You're my little baby.

1144
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:15,483
Thank you, Amber.

1145
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:17,542
You're the best thing
that's happened to me...

1146
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:19,315
since my son went off,
and I just...

1147
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:22,990
I love you, honey.

1148
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:24,515
I love you, too.

1149
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:29,156
Fuckin' 1980, you know?

1150
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:30,665
Can you believe it?

1151
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:33,827
I can't. It's, like,
the next thing you know...

1152
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:36,167
it's going to be,
like, 1990 and 2000.

1153
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:38,002
I mean, can you imagine?

1154
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:41,009
Good-bye, 1979.

1155
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:43,534
Hello, 1980.

1156
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:48,015
Make sure you snort it back...

1157
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:51,178
real quick and hard.

1158
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:52,710
Like this.

1159
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:07,468
It burns.

1160
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,970
It's good, though, right?

1161
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:10,972
It's going in my throat.

1162
01:15:11,006 --> 01:15:13,474
That's the drip.
The drip's the best part.

1163
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:14,976
It tastes like aspirin.

1164
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:17,478
Here. Do one more
in the other nostril.

1165
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,481
I need a drink of water.

1166
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:23,007
One more...
and then a drink of water.

1167
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:32,453
Do you think
I look cool when I do it?

1168
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:39,964
Let's talk about the future.

1169
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:42,994
Let's talk about what it really
means to this industry...

1170
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:45,506
and let's talk about
how all of us, not one of us...

1171
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,441
how all of us
are going to profit.

1172
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:52,243
Now, I've been doing theater
in San Francisco, San Diego...

1173
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:54,613
about as long as you've been
doing stag and hard core.

1174
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:57,118
We're all familiar
with your biography, Floyd.

1175
01:15:57,152 --> 01:16:00,053
No one doubts your credentials
or your history.

1176
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:01,715
Then why the resistance?

1177
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:05,420
This industry is going to be
turned upside down soon enough.

1178
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:09,556
- Why help it?
- Why not be prepared?

1179
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:11,725
The Colonel's got the money.
You got the talent.

1180
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:13,735
I got the connections
to the equipment...

1181
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:15,396
and the mail-order
distribution...

1182
01:16:15,437 --> 01:16:17,405
not to mention
those kids out there...

1183
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:19,600
who are hot fuck action
to the max, Jack.

1184
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:23,401
This is the future.
Videotape tells the truth.

1185
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:24,935
Wait a minute.

1186
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:27,972
You come into my house,
my party...

1187
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:30,484
to tell me about the future?

1188
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:33,488
That the future is tape...
videotape... and not film?

1189
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:35,990
It's amateurs
and not professionals?

1190
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:37,491
I'm a filmmaker.

1191
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:40,825
That's why I will never
make a movie on videotape.

1192
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:42,454
I'll tell you something else.

1193
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:44,522
I will never, ever loan out...

1194
01:16:44,566 --> 01:16:46,830
any of the actors
that I have under contract.

1195
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:48,665
Wait, Jack.

1196
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:52,800
I'm not a complicated man.
I like cinema.

1197
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:54,832
In particular, I like to see
people fucking on film...

1198
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:56,844
but I don't want
to win an Oscar...

1199
01:16:56,878 --> 01:16:58,846
and I don't want
to reinvent the wheel.

1200
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,279
I like simple pleasures...

1201
01:17:00,315 --> 01:17:02,943
like butter in my ass,
lollipops in my mouth.

1202
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:05,613
That's just me. That's just
something that I enjoy.

1203
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:07,622
Call me crazy,
call me a pervert...

1204
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:10,955
but there's one little thing
I want to do in this life...

1205
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:14,952
and that is to make a dollar
and a cent in this business.

1206
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:17,465
I'm not trying to hurt you.

1207
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:21,060
I'm trying to help you stay
one step ahead of the game.

1208
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:22,968
We're going in circles now...

1209
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:24,939
but we're in familiar territory.

1210
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:27,134
The territory we're in
is the future...

1211
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:28,904
not to mention the cost.

1212
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:32,971
If it looks like shit,
and it sounds like shit...

1213
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:34,846
then it must be shit.

1214
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:37,147
You're holding on too tight.

1215
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:39,312
It doesn't have to look good.

1216
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:41,481
Film is just
too damn expensive...

1217
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:45,289
and the theaters are already
converting to video projectors.

1218
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:46,988
I haven't heard that.

1219
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:48,519
Well, it's true.

1220
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:53,160
Well...

1221
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,895
ten minutes before the new year.

1222
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:02,032
I'd like to spend it
with my friends.

1223
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:05,843
We will or will not continue
this conversation.

1224
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:15,116
What's up?

1225
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:16,624
Fuckin' New Year's, right?

1226
01:18:16,658 --> 01:18:17,784
1980.

1227
01:18:17,826 --> 01:18:19,953
Man, right.
Did you see my new car?

1228
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:21,462
You got a new car?

1229
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:23,123
- Want to see?
- Yeah.

1230
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:24,792
All right, cool.
It's out front.

1231
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:26,460
Come on. It's out front.

1232
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:29,629
I want you to meet my friend.
Todd Parker, Dirk Diggler.

1233
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:31,298
What's up, man? How are you?

1234
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:32,806
We finally meet.

1235
01:18:32,841 --> 01:18:35,309
I was telling you
about him before.

1236
01:18:35,343 --> 01:18:37,470
Todd Parker... he works
at Party Boys Strip Club.

1237
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:39,139
Cool. You're a dancer.

1238
01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:40,773
Yeah. I got some moves.

1239
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:45,142
I'm sorry. Are you coming?

1240
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:46,984
Listen, I'll be around
in a little bit.

1241
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:49,650
We can talk then, all right?

1242
01:18:49,691 --> 01:18:51,181
See you later, Reed.

1243
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:57,464
When you get by the lights,
close your eyes, OK?

1244
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:58,966
All right.

1245
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,400
All right,
just follow my voice.

1246
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:03,927
All right, here,
here, here, here...

1247
01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:09,410
Where?

1248
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:11,412
Keep coming.
All right, open them.

1249
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:13,414
This is it.

1250
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:14,915
It's cool!

1251
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:16,577
Yeah!
You want to get inside?

1252
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:18,245
When did you get this?

1253
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:20,254
Yesterday. Actually I had it
painted yesterday...

1254
01:19:20,288 --> 01:19:22,256
so the paint might still be
kind of sticky.

1255
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:23,757
This is great, man.

1256
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:25,760
You want to go for a ride?

1257
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:28,627
Wait. Fuck.
Hell, how much time is left?

1258
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:31,599
I'm sorry, Dirk.

1259
01:19:31,633 --> 01:19:33,601
What the hell
is the matter with you?

1260
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:35,262
Why did you do that, Scotty?

1261
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:36,930
You look at me sometimes.

1262
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:38,940
I want to know if you like me.

1263
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:40,942
Of course...
Yeah, I like you, Scotty.

1264
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:42,443
Can I kiss you?

1265
01:19:42,477 --> 01:19:44,445
Please?
Can I kiss you on the mouth?

1266
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:46,447
- No!
- Please let me.

1267
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:48,813
- Scotty!
- I'm really sorry.

1268
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:51,250
I didn't mean to grab you
like that or scare you.

1269
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:53,083
- It's all right, man.
- Do you want to kiss me?

1270
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:57,787
- What is the matter with you?
- All right, forget it.

1271
01:19:57,826 --> 01:19:59,623
I'm really drunk. Really, I am.

1272
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:02,129
I'm out of my head.

1273
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:04,632
I'm really wasted.
Really, Dirk.

1274
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:06,133
I understand, man.

1275
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:08,466
I'm crazy right now.
I'm really crazy.

1276
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:10,494
Do you want to go back inside?

1277
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,169
Do you like my car, Dirk?

1278
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:16,473
What? Yeah.

1279
01:20:16,511 --> 01:20:18,479
Because I wanted to...

1280
01:20:18,513 --> 01:20:20,981
I wanted to make sure
you thought it was cool...

1281
01:20:21,016 --> 01:20:23,177
or else I was going
to take it back.

1282
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:28,286
- It's great, Scotty.
- Happy New Year.

1283
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:31,993
I love you.
I really love you.

1284
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:34,825
I love you, too, Scotty.

1285
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:36,660
Let's go back inside, OK?

1286
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:38,188
All right. All right.

1287
01:20:45,974 --> 01:20:48,499
Fuckin' idiot.

1288
01:20:48,543 --> 01:20:51,034
I'm a fuckin' idiot.

1289
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:16,994
Two minutes, pops. Two minutes.

1290
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:28,482
Come on, Little Bill!

1291
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:31,007
OK, Becky. I'm...

1292
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:38,151
Little Bill! Smile, man!

1293
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:40,927
Right.

1294
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:51,505
Little Bill, champagne?

1295
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:53,507
Aw, thanks.
That's really nice of you.

1296
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:56,533
- Happy New Year.
- To you, too.

1297
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:12,289
Hey, Kurt,
have you seen my wife?

1298
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,124
No. Hey, they're doing
that countdown thing.

1299
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:16,062
Come on in, man.

1300
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:59,166
We need something
to make a toast.

1301
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:01,801
Hey, Little Bill, look at me.

1302
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:06,107
Ten, nine, eight...

1303
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:09,110
seven, six, five...

1304
01:24:09,144 --> 01:24:12,136
four, three, two...

1305
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:33,461
What about your character
Brock Landers...

1306
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:37,335
and what some people consider
violent attitudes towards women?

1307
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:39,363
Violence?

1308
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:41,272
No. What...

1309
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:46,305
I mean, if there's
a certain amount of...

1310
01:24:46,347 --> 01:24:49,783
you know, violence or action
in this series of films,

1311
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:50,978
you know, that's the movie.

1312
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:56,953
If Brock Landers
is slick with a gun...

1313
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:59,892
he does so only in the vein
of good and right.

1314
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:02,522
Brock protects the values
of the American ideal...

1315
01:25:02,564 --> 01:25:05,158
and fights for causes
that instill pride...

1316
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:08,328
in a society where morals
are hard to come by.

1317
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,337
Who sent you?!

1318
01:25:10,371 --> 01:25:11,838
Get the fuck off me.

1319
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:14,398
Lie still, or I'll punch you
in the goddamn face!

1320
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:15,966
Get the fuck off!

1321
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:19,239
I'll find out who sent you.

1322
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:24,877
Amber, I live in this world.

1323
01:25:24,919 --> 01:25:28,377
I don't like violence
any more than you do.

1324
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:30,891
Violence is a bad thing.

1325
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:33,894
But when you see
violence in films...

1326
01:25:33,928 --> 01:25:35,896
it's... you know...

1327
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:40,367
if movies...
films caused violence...

1328
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:42,426
we'd be able to wipe out
violence tomorrow.

1329
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:44,461
Boom. No more films.
That's fine with me.

1330
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:46,906
I'll find something else to do.
I'll fuck on my own time.

1331
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:51,742
You know, I got other interests.
I'm a magician.

1332
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:54,407
That will be something that
I focus on in the future...

1333
01:25:54,449 --> 01:25:56,417
because you can't fuck forever.
I realize that.

1334
01:25:56,451 --> 01:25:58,419
Anyway, violence...

1335
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:02,082
is something that plagues us
as a society.

1336
01:26:02,123 --> 01:26:06,719
The fine line is,
I'm playing a character.

1337
01:26:06,761 --> 01:26:08,558
You know, I mean,
I'm Dirk Diggler.

1338
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:12,924
Brock Landers is a character
that I'm playing.

1339
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:16,027
I'm going to ask you once more,
and I'm going to ask you nice.

1340
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:18,368
Where the fuck is Ringo,
you bitch?

1341
01:26:18,406 --> 01:26:19,930
Fuck you.

1342
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:23,875
Why do I love him?

1343
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:27,871
He's very special,
and he can fuck hard...

1344
01:26:27,916 --> 01:26:30,043
or he can fuck,
like, really gently.

1345
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:31,949
He's the best.

1346
01:26:31,986 --> 01:26:34,216
I think that's... that's...

1347
01:26:34,255 --> 01:26:37,224
part of my reason
for doing this, you know.

1348
01:26:37,258 --> 01:26:39,886
I've gotten thousands
upon thousands of letters...

1349
01:26:39,928 --> 01:26:41,896
you know,
from people telling me...

1350
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:43,625
"God, you've taught me this...

1351
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:46,065
and you've made our love life
so much better."

1352
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:48,227
And this isn't go out
and have sex...

1353
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:50,567
with ten million people
and how to get a girl off.

1354
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:52,402
It's about how to get
your wife off.

1355
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:55,409
If only people could have
been doing this before...

1356
01:26:55,443 --> 01:26:57,911
we could have saved
a million relationships.

1357
01:26:57,946 --> 01:26:59,811
I've saved thousands.

1358
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:02,008
Blocking,
an idea of movement...

1359
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,348
Jack will put
the final touches together...

1360
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:06,785
for what the camera needs
for editing and stuff...

1361
01:27:06,821 --> 01:27:10,018
but he allows me
to block my own sex scenes...

1362
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:14,358
gives me the freedom to develop
the character and stuff.

1363
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:19,355
God, I don't know any other
director who'd let an actor...

1364
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,891
you know, do that.
You know?

1365
01:27:24,138 --> 01:27:27,198
I don't allow him to block
his own sex scenes.

1366
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,870
It is. It's jealousy.

1367
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:31,879
It's deceitfulness.
It's vindictiveness.

1368
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:34,040
It's all of that stuff,
you know?

1369
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:38,041
But I mean, God, what can you
expect when you're on top?

1370
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:40,384
It's like Napoleon.
When he was the king...

1371
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:43,049
people were just constantly
trying to conquer him...

1372
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:45,423
in the Roman empire, so it's...

1373
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:49,328
history repeating itself
all over again.

1374
01:27:49,364 --> 01:27:51,059
To all the critics out there...

1375
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:53,067
I know they're going
to be reviewing this...

1376
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:54,898
and I know they're going
to try to knock me.

1377
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:56,062
I just want them to know...

1378
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:58,231
Is it OK if I say this
into the camera?

1379
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:03,839
I only am who I am
because I was born that way.

1380
01:28:03,878 --> 01:28:07,177
I have a gift, and I am trying
to not be selfish about it...

1381
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:08,842
but to use it, OK?

1382
01:28:08,883 --> 01:28:13,115
If you want to knock me
for that, it's your own problem.

1383
01:28:13,154 --> 01:28:14,553
Jealousy will get you nowhere.

1384
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:17,752
I'm going to keep rockin' on.

1385
01:28:19,227 --> 01:28:20,854
For Dirk Diggler...

1386
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:24,854
the future is something
to look forward to, not to fear.

1387
01:28:24,899 --> 01:28:27,868
He is a creative man
of many interests...

1388
01:28:27,902 --> 01:28:31,861
film, poetry, karate,
music, dance.

1389
01:28:31,906 --> 01:28:34,670
He is a man
of passion and mystery.

1390
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:36,301
He is a man of lust.

1391
01:28:46,888 --> 01:28:48,219
It's my poem to you.

1392
01:28:48,256 --> 01:28:49,723
It's good, Amber.
It's really good.

1393
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:51,384
You're a director now.

1394
01:28:51,426 --> 01:28:53,394
So have you shown Jack yet?

1395
01:28:53,428 --> 01:28:55,896
No. I wanted you
to be the first.

1396
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:57,898
It's really good, Amber.
Congratulations.

1397
01:28:57,932 --> 01:28:59,627
Thanks, baby.

1398
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:03,765
The only thing
I was wondering is...

1399
01:29:03,805 --> 01:29:06,171
you might want to cut that part
where Jack talks about...

1400
01:29:06,207 --> 01:29:07,970
About blocking the sex?

1401
01:29:09,444 --> 01:29:11,173
That stuff about me not being
a black belt is not true.

1402
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:13,305
Yeah. I can fix that.

1403
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:16,144
- Ace of spades.
- How'd it turn out?

1404
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:18,378
Are you sure?

1405
01:29:21,222 --> 01:29:22,849
Hey, how was it, man?

1406
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:24,380
What?

1407
01:29:26,394 --> 01:29:29,852
Look, slow down.

1408
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:31,865
Guys, guys, guys.

1409
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:35,391
Slow down, Colonel.
Say again?

1410
01:29:38,906 --> 01:29:40,897
I'll be right there.

1411
01:29:49,917 --> 01:29:51,384
So?

1412
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:53,910
Let me tell you, Jack.

1413
01:29:55,423 --> 01:29:58,392
I don't mean
to laugh about it...

1414
01:29:58,426 --> 01:30:02,055
but she was 15 going on 150,
believe me.

1415
01:30:02,096 --> 01:30:05,065
She was. You would
never know it, never know.

1416
01:30:05,099 --> 01:30:07,567
I was fooled completely.

1417
01:30:07,602 --> 01:30:10,594
I've had a few of them.
Anyhow...

1418
01:30:11,939 --> 01:30:13,839
You do believe me,
don't you, Jack?

1419
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:15,809
Yeah, I believe you.

1420
01:30:15,843 --> 01:30:17,777
Anyway, so I take her home,
Jack...

1421
01:30:17,812 --> 01:30:19,803
you know,
and I got her there...

1422
01:30:19,847 --> 01:30:22,816
and I tell her not
to do so much coke...

1423
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:26,308
but she must have done
twenty lines in five minutes.

1424
01:30:26,354 --> 01:30:28,481
It's like a vacuum in her nose.

1425
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:30,491
Just going up like crazy.

1426
01:30:30,525 --> 01:30:32,493
Anyway, she's got
all this stuff going on...

1427
01:30:32,527 --> 01:30:34,495
and the next thing,
she stopped...

1428
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:36,326
something must have
broken up there...

1429
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:38,332
because blood poured
all over the place...

1430
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:39,958
all over the sheets
and everything.

1431
01:30:40,001 --> 01:30:42,993
Just pouring out. Oh, Jack.

1432
01:30:43,037 --> 01:30:46,006
All right,
you thought she was older.

1433
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:48,167
You didn't do anything.

1434
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:50,837
She was just at your place.

1435
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:52,675
You didn't do anything, right?

1436
01:30:52,713 --> 01:30:55,011
- Right. Nothing.
- You didn't do anything to her?

1437
01:30:55,049 --> 01:30:56,346
Not a thing. You know me, Jack.
I didn't do a thing.

1438
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:59,012
- You didn't do anything?
- I didn't do anything.

1439
01:30:59,053 --> 01:31:00,577
All right, nothing.

1440
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:05,481
But they...

1441
01:31:07,161 --> 01:31:09,721
they found something
at the house.

1442
01:31:11,499 --> 01:31:12,966
What?

1443
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,592
There's something that's...

1444
01:31:16,504 --> 01:31:18,972
Jack, it's my fuckin' weakness.

1445
01:31:19,006 --> 01:31:22,464
They're so small,
and they're so cute...

1446
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:24,705
and they're so adorable.

1447
01:31:24,745 --> 01:31:26,303
I just can't help it when...

1448
01:31:26,347 --> 01:31:27,814
Jesus Christ.

1449
01:31:27,849 --> 01:31:30,317
Listen,
I don't touch them, Jack.

1450
01:31:30,351 --> 01:31:32,319
I don't touch them
in any way, honestly.

1451
01:31:32,353 --> 01:31:34,480
Jack, please.

1452
01:31:34,522 --> 01:31:36,353
All right.

1453
01:31:39,527 --> 01:31:42,325
Now you think I'm an asshole.

1454
01:31:43,865 --> 01:31:45,833
Jack, let me tell you this.

1455
01:31:45,867 --> 01:31:48,335
I love you, Jack.
I'm your friend.

1456
01:31:48,369 --> 01:31:51,668
There's one thing
I want you to do, though.

1457
01:31:51,706 --> 01:31:55,073
Jack, come on.
Tell me that you're my friend.

1458
01:31:55,109 --> 01:31:56,974
Just tell me.
Am I your friend?

1459
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:25,131
- I do.
- I do, too.

1460
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:32,509
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1461
01:32:38,419 --> 01:32:42,014
Listen, I'm dying
to do a movie with you.

1462
01:32:53,034 --> 01:32:55,764
I'll tell you
what comes to mind.

1463
01:32:57,038 --> 01:33:00,007
What comes to mind is,
I am the ultimate Latin lover.

1464
01:33:00,007 --> 01:33:02,441
There is no Latin lover
like me. You understand?

1465
01:33:02,476 --> 01:33:04,444
Once you get Maurice
as the Latin lover...

1466
01:33:04,478 --> 01:33:06,946
Have you ever been
to Niagara Falls?

1467
01:33:06,981 --> 01:33:10,280
That is great!
That's so great, you guys.

1468
01:33:10,318 --> 01:33:13,446
It's an opportunity for me
to run the store my way.

1469
01:33:13,487 --> 01:33:15,955
Just get those guys off my back.

1470
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:17,116
Exactly.

1471
01:33:17,158 --> 01:33:18,955
I'll run the store my way.

1472
01:33:18,993 --> 01:33:20,790
Are you guys
moving to Bakersfield?

1473
01:33:20,828 --> 01:33:22,955
- Yeah.
- Soon?

1474
01:33:22,997 --> 01:33:24,965
Aren't your folks
from Bakersfield?

1475
01:33:24,999 --> 01:33:26,967
Hey, guys,
we're losing these two.

1476
01:33:27,001 --> 01:33:29,469
- Wow.
- You like it there?

1477
01:33:29,503 --> 01:33:31,664
Big promotion!

1478
01:33:31,739 --> 01:33:34,640
You look at the movies
and say, "Hell, I can do that."

1479
01:33:34,675 --> 01:33:36,142
I can do it.

1480
01:33:36,177 --> 01:33:38,304
It's a little more complicated
than that.

1481
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:41,543
It's a tough racket.
Dirk, you made it.

1482
01:33:41,582 --> 01:33:44,312
- Hey, Jack.
- How you doing?

1483
01:33:44,352 --> 01:33:46,547
Good. Who's that?

1484
01:33:46,587 --> 01:33:48,987
Hi. I'm Johnny Doe.

1485
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:51,514
You're... Dirk Diggler.

1486
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:54,852
It's great to meet you.

1487
01:33:57,365 --> 01:34:00,266
Johnny's the new boy
on the street.

1488
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:03,464
He's interested
in show business.

1489
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:12,108
He's very tired.

1490
01:34:12,146 --> 01:34:14,637
And he's shy, you know?

1491
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:20,113
So like I said,
it's a tough business.

1492
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:22,213
You got a great kisser...

1493
01:34:22,256 --> 01:34:26,454
but there's a lot of work
involved, a lot of people.

1494
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:29,463
We all have to work
our buns off.

1495
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:30,964
Know what I mean?

1496
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:35,492
It takes sixteen guys
just to do the lighting.

1497
01:34:37,638 --> 01:34:40,129
No, it's crystal, man.
You just want to do bumps.

1498
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:41,334
Shut up, man.

1499
01:34:44,011 --> 01:34:45,376
Hey, you guys.

1500
01:34:46,547 --> 01:34:49,482
- What?
- Just saying hey.

1501
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:51,485
Yeah, whatever.

1502
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:53,009
Oh, man.

1503
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:57,157
You all right?

1504
01:34:57,191 --> 01:34:59,159
It's getting me
fuckin' high, man.

1505
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:00,888
It's that carpet dope.

1506
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:03,595
The kind of dope
they used to put carpet in.

1507
01:35:03,631 --> 01:35:05,724
They'd mix it up
in the bathtub...

1508
01:35:05,766 --> 01:35:08,929
and while they were mixing it up
in the bathtub...

1509
01:35:08,969 --> 01:35:10,698
they'd drop in
a hunk of carpet into it.

1510
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:16,138
It's a lot better
than that pink shit.

1511
01:35:16,177 --> 01:35:17,303
The pink shit's fuckin' weird.

1512
01:35:17,344 --> 01:35:19,471
They put fish scales
in that shit.

1513
01:35:41,502 --> 01:35:43,470
You look good.

1514
01:35:43,504 --> 01:35:44,664
You ready?

1515
01:35:54,014 --> 01:35:55,675
Come on.

1516
01:35:58,519 --> 01:36:01,579
I am a star. I'm a fuckin'
rock and roll star.

1517
01:36:01,622 --> 01:36:04,250
Man, I got to get hard.
Come on. Fuck.

1518
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:06,088
Please don't do this to me.

1519
01:36:06,127 --> 01:36:07,754
No, please. Come on.

1520
01:36:07,795 --> 01:36:09,456
I'm a star.

1521
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:18,131
You ready?

1522
01:36:20,307 --> 01:36:22,434
I was born ready.

1523
01:36:22,476 --> 01:36:23,966
Come on.

1524
01:36:32,153 --> 01:36:33,745
I'm ready to shoot.

1525
01:36:35,089 --> 01:36:36,215
Twenty minutes, huh?

1526
01:36:36,257 --> 01:36:38,452
No. I'm ready now.
It's got to be now.

1527
01:36:38,492 --> 01:36:39,857
Twenty minutes, babe.

1528
01:36:39,894 --> 01:36:43,455
Fuck it. Hey, Jack.
I'm ready to shoot now.

1529
01:36:43,497 --> 01:36:45,965
My cock is ready.
I want to fuck.

1530
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,467
Twenty minutes.

1531
01:36:47,501 --> 01:36:49,628
I want to fuck.
Who's it going to be?

1532
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:51,001
What?

1533
01:36:51,038 --> 01:36:52,972
Who do you want
to start fucking? Me or him?

1534
01:36:53,007 --> 01:36:55,134
- Me? What?
- Shut up, OK?

1535
01:36:55,176 --> 01:36:56,643
I didn't do anything to you.

1536
01:36:56,677 --> 01:37:00,010
You're not even an actor, man.
You got no business being here.

1537
01:37:00,047 --> 01:37:01,241
Yes, I am.

1538
01:37:01,282 --> 01:37:03,250
No, I'm an actor, man.

1539
01:37:03,284 --> 01:37:04,410
Shut up!

1540
01:37:04,451 --> 01:37:05,611
What?

1541
01:37:06,787 --> 01:37:08,584
Stop this Mickey Mouse
bullshit.

1542
01:37:08,622 --> 01:37:10,749
I want you to go in there.

1543
01:37:10,791 --> 01:37:12,918
I want you to cool off, OK?

1544
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,088
Just cool off, and we'll
come back and shoot the scene.

1545
01:37:16,130 --> 01:37:17,757
I said I'm ready to shoot.

1546
01:37:17,798 --> 01:37:18,924
Not now.

1547
01:37:18,966 --> 01:37:20,763
I'm not going
to tell you again, Jack.

1548
01:37:22,069 --> 01:37:23,934
I'm not going to shoot you
in the state you're in.

1549
01:37:23,971 --> 01:37:26,940
What do you mean, state?
State of California?

1550
01:37:26,974 --> 01:37:28,601
I know where the fuck I am.

1551
01:37:28,642 --> 01:37:30,269
Jesus Christ,
you've been up for two days.

1552
01:37:30,311 --> 01:37:32,279
I haven't been up for two days.

1553
01:37:32,313 --> 01:37:34,611
You look like
you haven't been to sleep...

1554
01:37:34,648 --> 01:37:37,617
so I ain't gonna shoot you
because you don't look good.

1555
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:39,778
You know what?
You don't tell me anything.

1556
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:41,617
- Really?
- You're not the boss of me.

1557
01:37:41,655 --> 01:37:44,715
- Yes, I am.
- You're the king?

1558
01:37:44,758 --> 01:37:46,282
Don't you fuckin' touch me, man!

1559
01:37:46,327 --> 01:37:48,955
- Dirk, honey...
- You shut up, too.

1560
01:37:48,996 --> 01:37:51,123
You're not the mother of me,
and you're not my boss!

1561
01:37:51,165 --> 01:37:53,292
You're not my mother!
You're not my fuckin' mom!

1562
01:37:53,334 --> 01:37:55,131
I'll take you home.

1563
01:37:55,169 --> 01:37:57,467
No.
I'm ready to shoot the scene.

1564
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:59,404
I want to shoot the scene.
I'm fine.

1565
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,067
I want you out of here.

1566
01:38:01,108 --> 01:38:02,905
Look, it's over, OK?
I'm done.

1567
01:38:02,943 --> 01:38:04,911
Listen to me, kid.
I want you...

1568
01:38:04,945 --> 01:38:06,913
Don't you fuckin' call me a kid!

1569
01:38:06,947 --> 01:38:08,847
I'll fuck you up! You want
to see me kick some ass?

1570
01:38:08,883 --> 01:38:11,408
I know fuckin' karate!

1571
01:38:11,452 --> 01:38:13,682
You're fuckin' fired!

1572
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:15,416
You're fired, you goddamn kid!

1573
01:38:15,456 --> 01:38:16,855
Jack, what the hell...

1574
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:18,916
You know what?
No, no, no.

1575
01:38:18,959 --> 01:38:21,757
You know what?
I'm the biggest star here, man.

1576
01:38:21,795 --> 01:38:23,592
That's the way it is!

1577
01:38:23,631 --> 01:38:26,099
I want to fuck!
It's my big dick!

1578
01:38:26,133 --> 01:38:28,294
So everybody get ready
fuckin' now!

1579
01:38:30,170 --> 01:38:32,434
You know what?
I don't need this shit!

1580
01:38:32,473 --> 01:38:35,101
Fuck you! Fuck all of you!

1581
01:38:35,142 --> 01:38:37,610
You're not my boss!
You're not the king of me!

1582
01:38:37,645 --> 01:38:39,613
I am the fuckin' king of Dirk!

1583
01:38:39,647 --> 01:38:42,775
You're nothing without me, Jack!
You're fuckin' nothing!

1584
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:44,784
Fuck this, man!
I don't need this shit!

1585
01:38:44,818 --> 01:38:46,786
Dirk, wait. I'm so sorry, Jack.

1586
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:49,311
I'll take care of this.
I'll straighten him out.

1587
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:06,633
OK, Dirk, you ready?

1588
01:39:06,674 --> 01:39:09,040
I was born ready, Nick.
Let's go, man.

1589
01:39:09,076 --> 01:39:12,136
- Dirk Diggler demo...
- Keep the vocals up.

1590
01:39:12,179 --> 01:39:13,874
You Got The Touch, take seven.

1591
01:39:15,349 --> 01:39:16,509
Excuse me, Reed.

1592
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:25,023
You got the touch

1593
01:39:26,694 --> 01:39:29,527
You got the power

1594
01:39:40,874 --> 01:39:44,332
After all is said and done

1595
01:39:44,378 --> 01:39:47,677
You never walk, you never run

1596
01:39:47,715 --> 01:39:49,706
You're a winner

1597
01:39:52,052 --> 01:39:55,852
You've got the moves,
you know the streets

1598
01:39:55,889 --> 01:39:59,017
Break the rules, take the heat

1599
01:39:59,059 --> 01:40:01,391
You're nobody's fool

1600
01:40:03,731 --> 01:40:06,859
You're at your best
when the goin' gets rough

1601
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:11,860
You've been put to the test,
but it's never enough

1602
01:40:11,905 --> 01:40:13,839
You got the touch

1603
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:17,639
You think the bass
is taking away from the vocal?

1604
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:21,548
No, not really. Maybe.

1605
01:40:21,582 --> 01:40:23,982
It sounds balanced to me.

1606
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:26,213
It's definitely taking away
from my vocal.

1607
01:40:26,253 --> 01:40:29,222
Just take the bass down
and bring up the vocal.

1608
01:40:29,256 --> 01:40:30,780
OK, let's do it, Nick.
You heard him.

1609
01:40:31,925 --> 01:40:33,722
You want to take it
from the top?

1610
01:40:33,761 --> 01:40:35,092
Yeah. Let's try it.

1611
01:40:37,431 --> 01:40:42,391
Heat will rock you

1612
01:40:42,436 --> 01:40:47,032
And heat will roll you

1613
01:40:48,108 --> 01:40:53,068
Baby, don't you know?

1614
01:40:53,113 --> 01:40:58,745
My heat will move your soul

1615
01:40:58,786 --> 01:41:02,187
Come on, come on,
come on, come on

1616
01:41:02,222 --> 01:41:05,885
Love me today

1617
01:41:07,561 --> 01:41:11,554
Love me tomorrow

1618
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:14,364
All day

1619
01:41:14,401 --> 01:41:15,868
All night

1620
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:17,200
You feel

1621
01:41:17,237 --> 01:41:19,705
My heat

1622
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:23,699
Feel, feel, feel, feel my heat

1623
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:25,871
I think we should repeat
that again.

1624
01:41:25,913 --> 01:41:30,373
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel

1625
01:41:30,417 --> 01:41:32,248
Feel my heat

1626
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:35,388
Yeah.
It's definitely cool.

1627
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:38,724
Let's lay it down. Nick.

1628
01:41:38,759 --> 01:41:39,885
You want to lay it down?

1629
01:41:39,927 --> 01:41:41,121
Were we rolling
on that rehearsal?

1630
01:41:41,161 --> 01:41:43,129
Is he going to fuck me
in the ass?

1631
01:41:44,331 --> 01:41:45,457
Is that what you want?

1632
01:41:45,499 --> 01:41:47,467
It would be nice.

1633
01:41:47,501 --> 01:41:49,969
Fuck her in the ass.

1634
01:41:50,003 --> 01:41:51,994
Lock and load, Jack.

1635
01:41:59,813 --> 01:42:01,906
I was gonna take a pottery class
at Everywoman's Village.

1636
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:04,144
I want to do that.

1637
01:42:04,184 --> 01:42:06,709
Mondays, Wednesdays,
and Fridays at 3:00.

1638
01:42:06,753 --> 01:42:07,981
I was thinking something.

1639
01:42:09,723 --> 01:42:11,247
I was going to see
about taking the G.E.D.

1640
01:42:11,291 --> 01:42:12,918
Do you know what that is?

1641
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,894
For high school, to graduate.

1642
01:42:14,928 --> 01:42:17,260
I never got my diploma.
I feel bad that...

1643
01:42:17,297 --> 01:42:18,696
I think you were right
about that.

1644
01:42:18,732 --> 01:42:20,757
You should do it, Rollergirl,

1645
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:22,598
because you know what?

1646
01:42:22,636 --> 01:42:24,797
If you wanted to,
you could do anything.

1647
01:42:31,578 --> 01:42:33,102
- Mr. Swope.
- Yes. That's me.

1648
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:35,775
Do you have
your loan application?

1649
01:42:35,816 --> 01:42:38,341
- Do you want to follow me?
- Yes, I do.

1650
01:42:38,385 --> 01:42:40,945
Kurt, are we gonna
have any more coverage on this...

1651
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:44,321
No. We keep shooting.
This is video.

1652
01:42:44,358 --> 01:42:47,054
We shoot and shoot,
and then we deal with it later.

1653
01:42:47,094 --> 01:42:48,459
All right, now, Summer...

1654
01:42:48,495 --> 01:42:50,292
I want you to take Skye's
thong off.

1655
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:52,127
Actually take it off.

1656
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:53,633
That's good. And finger it.

1657
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:55,635
That's good. Lick the thong.

1658
01:42:55,669 --> 01:42:59,127
That's really good technically,
but it lacks passion.

1659
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:01,073
I want to see some passion here.

1660
01:43:01,108 --> 01:43:02,939
Yes, bitch!

1661
01:43:04,545 --> 01:43:08,572
Yeah, that's it. Lick my balls.

1662
01:43:08,615 --> 01:43:09,843
Fuck me.

1663
01:43:11,451 --> 01:43:13,180
Who's your daddy, bitch?

1664
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:14,949
You'll live.

1665
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,427
I'm back.

1666
01:43:21,461 --> 01:43:23,725
Perfect timing.

1667
01:43:27,768 --> 01:43:30,066
What the fuck
took you so long, man?

1668
01:43:40,948 --> 01:43:42,074
Fuck.

1669
01:43:42,115 --> 01:43:45,448
That's what Buck's
Super Stereo World is about.

1670
01:43:45,485 --> 01:43:47,612
It's about the customer
who wants to know...

1671
01:43:47,654 --> 01:43:50,054
what they're
getting into technically...

1672
01:43:50,090 --> 01:43:51,955
and I have the specific
technical hi-fi background...

1673
01:43:51,992 --> 01:43:54,460
to answer any technical question
somebody's going to have.

1674
01:43:54,494 --> 01:43:56,257
I've been in sound equipment
long enough to know exactly...

1675
01:43:56,296 --> 01:43:58,787
what a guy wants when
he walks through that door...

1676
01:43:58,832 --> 01:44:00,390
and that's the kind
of personal touch...

1677
01:44:00,434 --> 01:44:02,129
that Buck's Super Stereo World's
going to have.

1678
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,905
I miss my two sons.

1679
01:44:08,942 --> 01:44:12,400
I miss my little Andrew
and... and my Dirk.

1680
01:44:12,446 --> 01:44:16,075
I always felt
like Dirk was my baby...

1681
01:44:16,116 --> 01:44:17,583
my new baby.

1682
01:44:17,618 --> 01:44:19,210
Don't you miss Dirk?

1683
01:44:21,355 --> 01:44:23,414
He's so fuckin' talented,
the bastard.

1684
01:44:23,457 --> 01:44:24,947
You know, I just...

1685
01:44:27,227 --> 01:44:29,957
I love him, Rollergirl.
I really love the stupid jerk.

1686
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:34,733
I love you, Mom.

1687
01:44:35,802 --> 01:44:38,635
I want you to be my mom, Amber.
Are you my mom?

1688
01:44:38,672 --> 01:44:42,233
I'll ask you
if you're my mom, OK?

1689
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:45,268
And you say yes, OK?
Are you my mom?

1690
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:47,143
Yes, honey.

1691
01:44:52,686 --> 01:44:55,120
Hold on.
Come on, all right?

1692
01:44:55,155 --> 01:44:57,453
All we need is the tapes, Burt.

1693
01:44:57,491 --> 01:44:59,857
No. You don't get them
until you pay.

1694
01:44:59,893 --> 01:45:02,384
In our situation, that doesn't
make any fucking sense!

1695
01:45:02,429 --> 01:45:05,398
Wait! We can't pay
the price of the demo tapes...

1696
01:45:05,432 --> 01:45:08,629
unless we take the tapes to
the record company and get paid!

1697
01:45:08,669 --> 01:45:10,159
Hello?! Exactly!

1698
01:45:11,371 --> 01:45:12,929
That's not an M.P.

1699
01:45:12,973 --> 01:45:15,407
That's a Y. P... your problem.

1700
01:45:15,442 --> 01:45:16,909
Come up with the money,
and I'll give you the tapes.

1701
01:45:16,943 --> 01:45:18,069
That's it.

1702
01:45:18,111 --> 01:45:20,409
All right, now you're talking
above my head.

1703
01:45:20,447 --> 01:45:23,416
I don't know this industry
jargon... Y.P., M. P... whatever.

1704
01:45:23,450 --> 01:45:26,419
All I know is that I cannot get
a record contract.

1705
01:45:26,453 --> 01:45:29,422
We cannot get a record contract
unless I take these tapes...

1706
01:45:29,456 --> 01:45:31,924
and granted,
the tapes themselves are your...

1707
01:45:31,958 --> 01:45:34,426
You own them, OK?

1708
01:45:34,461 --> 01:45:36,429
But the magic
that is on the tapes...

1709
01:45:36,463 --> 01:45:39,432
that fuckin' heart and soul
we put into those tapes...

1710
01:45:39,466 --> 01:45:41,764
that is ours,
and you don't own that.

1711
01:45:41,802 --> 01:45:44,771
I need to take that magic and
get it to the record company.

1712
01:45:44,805 --> 01:45:46,432
And they're waiting for us.

1713
01:45:46,473 --> 01:45:48,532
We were supposed to be there
a half-hour ago.

1714
01:45:48,575 --> 01:45:51,135
We look like assholes
right now, man!

1715
01:45:57,718 --> 01:45:59,583
I don't want to do this
anymore, honey.

1716
01:45:59,619 --> 01:46:01,883
I can't.
Let's have fun now.

1717
01:46:01,922 --> 01:46:04,220
Let's just go and go and go...

1718
01:46:04,257 --> 01:46:06,725
because it's over.
There's too many things.

1719
01:46:10,597 --> 01:46:12,622
Let's go walk.

1720
01:46:12,666 --> 01:46:14,258
I don't want to leave this room.

1721
01:46:14,301 --> 01:46:15,928
Me, either.

1722
01:46:15,969 --> 01:46:19,530
- I love you, honey.
- I love you, Mom.

1723
01:46:19,573 --> 01:46:21,666
Let me explain to him...

1724
01:46:21,708 --> 01:46:24,233
in simple arithmetic...
one, two, three!

1725
01:46:24,277 --> 01:46:26,905
Because you don't
fuckin' get it, Burt!

1726
01:46:26,947 --> 01:46:30,713
You give us the tapes.
We get the record contract.

1727
01:46:30,751 --> 01:46:32,412
We come back and give you
your fuckin' money.

1728
01:46:32,452 --> 01:46:34,920
Have you heard the tapes?
Have you even heard them?

1729
01:46:34,955 --> 01:46:37,287
We're guaranteed a record deal.
Our stuff is that good!

1730
01:46:37,324 --> 01:46:39,884
Now I got it. Now I understand.

1731
01:46:39,926 --> 01:46:42,258
You want it to happen...

1732
01:46:42,295 --> 01:46:47,426
but it's not going to happen
because it's a Catch-22.

1733
01:46:47,467 --> 01:46:50,436
What the fuck does that mean?
What is a Catch-22, Burt?

1734
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:52,461
Catch-22, gentlemen.
Think about it.

1735
01:46:54,674 --> 01:46:57,108
You know what
I'm thinking about, man?

1736
01:46:57,144 --> 01:46:59,271
I'm thinking about
kicking some fuckin' ass!

1737
01:46:59,312 --> 01:47:01,041
Scotty, get him out of here!

1738
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:04,073
Thanks a lot for
backing us up, too. Real good.

1739
01:47:05,585 --> 01:47:07,143
Fuck!

1740
01:47:15,095 --> 01:47:17,063
We can't help you.

1741
01:47:19,766 --> 01:47:20,892
I have all the papers, though.

1742
01:47:20,934 --> 01:47:23,402
Everything's in order, yes?

1743
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:28,397
Yes, but we can't
give you a loan. I'm sorry.

1744
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:31,309
I don't understand.
Why can't you give me the loan?

1745
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:35,407
Mr. Swope,
you're a pornographer.

1746
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:37,917
This bank is not in business
to support pornography.

1747
01:47:37,951 --> 01:47:40,419
I'm not a pornographer.
I'm an actor.

1748
01:47:40,454 --> 01:47:42,922
- I'm sorry.
- Please.

1749
01:47:42,956 --> 01:47:45,925
This is a new business for me.

1750
01:47:45,959 --> 01:47:49,793
All right? It's a real thing
that I want to do.

1751
01:47:49,830 --> 01:47:51,263
It's a real thing that I can do.

1752
01:47:51,298 --> 01:47:52,526
Please.

1753
01:47:52,566 --> 01:47:54,033
I'm sorry.

1754
01:47:54,067 --> 01:47:55,591
We did everything right.

1755
01:47:55,635 --> 01:47:57,762
Honey, it's OK.
Just wait a minute.

1756
01:47:57,804 --> 01:47:59,772
Let's just take a minute, OK?

1757
01:47:59,806 --> 01:48:02,741
You have something to say.

1758
01:48:02,776 --> 01:48:03,936
I have something to say,
all right?

1759
01:48:03,977 --> 01:48:05,638
Let's just talk, OK?

1760
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:10,116
If there's something I didn't
fill out correctly on this...

1761
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:11,708
or if there is something
I left out...

1762
01:48:11,751 --> 01:48:13,719
or something maybe
you want me to write on there...

1763
01:48:13,753 --> 01:48:16,187
just tell me what to write.

1764
01:48:17,491 --> 01:48:18,651
I'm sorry.

1765
01:48:21,595 --> 01:48:23,392
You're not being fair!

1766
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:25,022
This isn't fair!

1767
01:48:25,065 --> 01:48:28,694
This financial institution
cannot endorse pornography.

1768
01:48:28,735 --> 01:48:32,227
Stop saying pornography!
Why are you doing this to me?

1769
01:48:32,272 --> 01:48:34,035
Please! Please!

1770
01:48:34,074 --> 01:48:35,541
I'm sorry.

1771
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:40,573
I am an ac...
I am an actor.

1772
01:48:45,085 --> 01:48:46,985
Come on.

1773
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:14,840
Aaron wants that thing
for the thing from...

1774
01:49:14,881 --> 01:49:16,348
You fix it up.

1775
01:49:29,896 --> 01:49:31,523
Who's your daddy?

1776
01:49:31,565 --> 01:49:33,032
How is it?

1777
01:49:33,066 --> 01:49:35,557
It is what it is.

1778
01:49:38,638 --> 01:49:40,572
Suck that cock, bitch.

1779
01:49:56,456 --> 01:49:58,048
You must be Maggie.

1780
01:49:58,091 --> 01:50:00,082
Kathleen O'Malley.
I'm the judge.

1781
01:50:03,763 --> 01:50:05,060
You have a lawyer with you?

1782
01:50:05,098 --> 01:50:07,658
No, I don't. I do not.

1783
01:50:24,618 --> 01:50:26,085
Hello, Judge.

1784
01:50:26,119 --> 01:50:27,609
Good morning, Counselor.

1785
01:50:49,442 --> 01:50:51,103
You've been divorced
for six years?

1786
01:50:51,144 --> 01:50:53,612
Yes, since 1977.

1787
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:57,105
The money settlement
has been taken care of?

1788
01:51:00,587 --> 01:51:02,145
So what we're
talking about, then...

1789
01:51:02,188 --> 01:51:04,554
is coming to an agreement
on the custody of...

1790
01:51:04,591 --> 01:51:06,081
of Andrew.

1791
01:51:09,095 --> 01:51:11,563
What was decided
during the divorce?

1792
01:51:11,598 --> 01:51:16,058
Initially, Andrew
was to go with his father...

1793
01:51:16,102 --> 01:51:21,768
for visitation with his mother
from Saturday noon...

1794
01:51:21,808 --> 01:51:25,073
to Sunday at 7:00 with his
mother entitled to bring him...

1795
01:51:25,111 --> 01:51:28,979
to her house
or any reasonable place.

1796
01:51:29,015 --> 01:51:30,277
Was that the understanding?

1797
01:51:32,385 --> 01:51:34,080
Why wasn't that visiting
privilege honored, then?

1798
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:36,588
It was for a while.

1799
01:51:36,623 --> 01:51:38,591
I only saw him twice.

1800
01:51:38,625 --> 01:51:41,594
It said "reasonable place."

1801
01:51:41,628 --> 01:51:43,095
I didn't think
that a house of prostitution...

1802
01:51:43,129 --> 01:51:45,597
and drugs and pornography
was that.

1803
01:51:45,632 --> 01:51:47,600
I'm sorry?

1804
01:51:47,634 --> 01:51:50,432
My wife
is in the pornography business.

1805
01:51:52,372 --> 01:51:54,533
I didn't think that environment
was a safe place for my son.

1806
01:51:54,574 --> 01:51:58,101
No, this is not right.
My son was never exposed...

1807
01:51:58,144 --> 01:52:01,545
to drugs or pornographic
material or any of those things.

1808
01:52:01,581 --> 01:52:03,549
My husband just assumed...

1809
01:52:03,583 --> 01:52:06,074
I saw it with my own eye,
Maggie.

1810
01:52:07,587 --> 01:52:10,055
Did you register a complaint?

1811
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:12,752
My client didn't officially
register, Your Honor...

1812
01:52:12,792 --> 01:52:17,991
but I think the circumstances
call for immediate action...

1813
01:52:18,031 --> 01:52:20,192
for the safety of the child.

1814
01:52:20,233 --> 01:52:23,498
The problem is, Judge,
is that my ex-wife...

1815
01:52:23,536 --> 01:52:26,334
she's a sick person,
and she needs help.

1816
01:52:26,372 --> 01:52:29,205
She deals in sex and drugs
for a living.

1817
01:52:29,242 --> 01:52:31,005
No, I don't do drugs.

1818
01:52:31,044 --> 01:52:34,502
Your Honor, she has been in and
out of trouble with the law...

1819
01:52:34,547 --> 01:52:38,449
on several occasions
for this sort of thing.

1820
01:52:38,485 --> 01:52:40,009
Not anymore.

1821
01:52:40,053 --> 01:52:42,021
Have you ever been arrested?

1822
01:52:46,893 --> 01:52:49,521
When was the last time
you were arrested...

1823
01:52:49,562 --> 01:52:50,927
and what was the charge?

1824
01:53:09,182 --> 01:53:13,209
OK, let's get ready
for this... experiment.

1825
01:53:13,353 --> 01:53:17,551
Hi. Jack Horner here.

1826
01:53:17,590 --> 01:53:19,319
We're in the back
of this beautiful limousine...

1827
01:53:19,359 --> 01:53:23,455
in the back seat riding west
along Sherman Way...

1828
01:53:23,496 --> 01:53:28,957
and beside me is a beautiful,
talented, gorgeous...

1829
01:53:29,002 --> 01:53:31,470
young actress
from adult cinema...

1830
01:53:31,504 --> 01:53:33,972
Miss Rollergirl.

1831
01:53:35,508 --> 01:53:38,966
Are you ready to get on
with this experiment?

1832
01:53:39,012 --> 01:53:41,981
Ready like Freddy.

1833
01:53:42,015 --> 01:53:44,984
Yes. And we're going along,
like I said...

1834
01:53:45,018 --> 01:53:46,986
west on Sherman Way...

1835
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:49,989
and this is called
On The Lookout...

1836
01:53:50,023 --> 01:53:51,888
that's the name of this show...

1837
01:53:51,925 --> 01:53:55,486
on the lookout
for a young stud...

1838
01:53:55,528 --> 01:53:58,986
who maybe will get
in the back seat here...

1839
01:53:59,032 --> 01:54:01,933
and get it on
with Rollergirl.

1840
01:54:01,968 --> 01:54:06,428
We're going
to make film history...

1841
01:54:06,472 --> 01:54:09,373
right here on videotape.

1842
01:54:26,793 --> 01:54:28,055
Waiting for someone?

1843
01:54:31,931 --> 01:54:33,421
I'm waiting
for somebody, but...

1844
01:54:33,466 --> 01:54:35,434
I'm not sure
if they're going to show up.

1845
01:54:36,970 --> 01:54:38,130
You want to wait in the car?

1846
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:42,100
Cool.

1847
01:55:10,536 --> 01:55:11,833
I'm Joe.

1848
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:18,943
You know who I am?

1849
01:55:24,550 --> 01:55:26,245
My name's Dirk Diggler.

1850
01:55:30,723 --> 01:55:33,214
I mean, you're a guy.
I'm just helping you out.

1851
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:38,227
What do you see here?

1852
01:55:39,632 --> 01:55:41,190
I see a girl.

1853
01:55:42,402 --> 01:55:43,960
Do you like what you see?

1854
01:55:45,138 --> 01:55:46,366
Yeah, I do.

1855
01:55:47,573 --> 01:55:49,939
Get in...

1856
01:55:49,976 --> 01:55:52,945
and let's make film history.

1857
01:55:56,449 --> 01:55:57,609
So...

1858
01:55:58,952 --> 01:56:00,146
what do you want to do?

1859
01:56:01,721 --> 01:56:03,484
It's what you want to do.

1860
01:56:05,792 --> 01:56:07,350
I want to watch you.

1861
01:56:08,895 --> 01:56:11,363
I mean, I'm not gay.
I just want to...

1862
01:56:12,966 --> 01:56:15,457
Maybe you could jerk off,
and I could watch.

1863
01:56:17,136 --> 01:56:18,296
Maybe I'll join in later...

1864
01:56:18,338 --> 01:56:20,602
but for now,
I just want to watch.

1865
01:56:22,875 --> 01:56:24,502
Twenty bucks.

1866
01:56:26,946 --> 01:56:28,504
Ten's all I have.

1867
01:56:33,319 --> 01:56:35,082
Go to school?

1868
01:56:35,121 --> 01:56:37,783
Yeah, I do.

1869
01:56:37,824 --> 01:56:39,155
Where do you go?

1870
01:56:41,995 --> 01:56:44,020
Is it OK if I don't tell you?

1871
01:56:44,063 --> 01:56:46,054
That's cool.

1872
01:56:48,034 --> 01:56:50,434
You recognize Rollergirl
from her films?

1873
01:56:52,538 --> 01:56:54,972
We watch her films a lot
at my frat house.

1874
01:56:55,008 --> 01:56:57,442
I go to CSUN.

1875
01:56:57,477 --> 01:56:58,603
Wonderful.

1876
01:56:58,644 --> 01:57:00,805
The fuckin' guys
will never believe this.

1877
01:57:02,382 --> 01:57:04,907
We've done
a bunch of films together...

1878
01:57:04,951 --> 01:57:07,146
Rollergirl and I.

1879
01:57:07,186 --> 01:57:08,710
Do you remember me?

1880
01:57:10,523 --> 01:57:12,218
We went to school together.

1881
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:16,021
Your name's Brandy, right?

1882
01:57:17,630 --> 01:57:19,928
Brandy's your name, right?

1883
01:57:24,037 --> 01:57:25,163
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1884
01:57:25,204 --> 01:57:26,796
Your name's not Brandy?

1885
01:57:38,217 --> 01:57:39,411
Can you do it harder?

1886
01:57:49,495 --> 01:57:51,725
Do it a little faster.

1887
01:57:55,868 --> 01:57:57,028
All right.

1888
01:58:01,207 --> 01:58:02,799
You're hiding her again.

1889
01:58:02,842 --> 01:58:04,969
Let's get on the other side.
That's it.

1890
01:58:07,046 --> 01:58:09,606
Just nice and sexy.

1891
01:58:17,423 --> 01:58:19,755
Listen, pal...

1892
01:58:19,792 --> 01:58:21,555
make it a little more sexy.

1893
01:58:21,594 --> 01:58:24,324
Don't just ram it in like that.

1894
01:58:24,363 --> 01:58:27,355
She's not a hole in the wall.
This is Rollergirl.

1895
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:29,095
Faster.

1896
01:58:33,005 --> 01:58:34,131
Do it faster.

1897
01:58:35,708 --> 01:58:37,175
Get your hand wet.

1898
01:58:37,210 --> 01:58:38,370
Be quiet.

1899
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:42,342
Can you be more sexy?

1900
01:58:42,381 --> 01:58:44,941
Like, cinematically sexy.

1901
01:58:44,984 --> 01:58:46,451
Just don't ram it.

1902
01:58:46,486 --> 01:58:48,215
Don't...

1903
01:58:48,254 --> 01:58:50,779
Be respectful.
This is Rollergirl.

1904
01:58:52,391 --> 01:58:53,790
Are you listening to me?

1905
01:58:53,826 --> 01:58:55,350
Just let me do my thing.

1906
01:58:55,394 --> 01:58:57,055
This is stupid.

1907
01:58:57,096 --> 01:58:59,496
That's it. Cut.

1908
01:58:59,532 --> 01:59:00,658
Pull over.

1909
01:59:11,010 --> 01:59:12,910
I can't fucking believe this.

1910
01:59:12,945 --> 01:59:14,071
You gave me a hard-on.

1911
01:59:14,113 --> 01:59:16,206
The least you could do
is jack me off.

1912
01:59:17,783 --> 01:59:19,546
What the fuck did you say?

1913
01:59:20,953 --> 01:59:24,411
I said it's not cool to leave me
with a hard-on.

1914
01:59:24,457 --> 01:59:25,788
Fuck you.

1915
01:59:28,361 --> 01:59:30,192
I don't fucking believe this.

1916
01:59:33,232 --> 01:59:35,257
This is a fine life
you've made for yourself.

1917
01:59:37,203 --> 01:59:39,467
You really should be proud.

1918
01:59:39,505 --> 01:59:40,802
I mean really.

1919
01:59:44,544 --> 01:59:45,704
Fuck you.

1920
01:59:47,013 --> 01:59:49,243
And your fucking films
suck now anyway.

1921
01:59:54,954 --> 01:59:56,148
Come on.

1922
01:59:58,958 --> 02:00:00,823
I can't.

1923
02:00:00,860 --> 02:00:03,556
I can't get it hard.
I just can't. I'm sorry.

1924
02:00:07,300 --> 02:00:09,962
You shouldn't do
this sort of thing, faggot.

1925
02:00:11,204 --> 02:00:12,569
Get him out of the car!

1926
02:00:12,605 --> 02:00:14,004
Jack, Jesus!

1927
02:00:19,812 --> 02:00:22,280
Get him out of the truck!

1928
02:00:22,315 --> 02:00:24,215
You shouldn't be
coming down here!

1929
02:00:31,490 --> 02:00:34,186
- You piece of shit!
- You faggot!

1930
02:00:37,430 --> 02:00:38,727
Amateur fucker!

1931
02:00:39,765 --> 02:00:41,289
Come on!

1932
02:00:49,575 --> 02:00:52,510
You don't ever disrespect me,
fucker!

1933
02:00:52,545 --> 02:00:55,776
You don't ever disrespect me!

1934
02:00:55,815 --> 02:00:57,908
Motherfucker!
Look at you now, huh?

1935
02:00:57,950 --> 02:00:59,542
That's what you get, you faggot!

1936
02:00:59,585 --> 02:01:02,679
You think you can fuck?
You can't fuck me!

1937
02:01:02,722 --> 02:01:04,713
You can't touch me!

1938
02:01:07,059 --> 02:01:08,492
Stop it!

1939
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:12,461
You don't do this, donkey-dick!

1940
02:01:15,434 --> 02:01:17,629
Fucking faggot!

1941
02:01:21,907 --> 02:01:24,967
You don't ever disrespect me...

1942
02:01:25,011 --> 02:01:26,706
you fucker!

1943
02:01:26,746 --> 02:01:29,146
You fucking piece of shit!

1944
02:01:29,181 --> 02:01:31,775
You fucking...

1945
02:01:31,817 --> 02:01:34,149
Fucking die, you shithead!

1946
02:02:13,459 --> 02:02:14,585
What do you want?

1947
02:02:14,627 --> 02:02:19,121
I want an apple fritter,
jelly...

1948
02:02:19,165 --> 02:02:20,359
chocolate with sprinkles...

1949
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:23,027
and a bear claw, too.

1950
02:02:24,970 --> 02:02:26,130
And hurry.

1951
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:29,369
How's my little
kung fu fighter?

1952
02:02:29,408 --> 02:02:32,343
He's kicking ass
inside my stomach.

1953
02:02:32,378 --> 02:02:33,868
See? That's a boy.

1954
02:02:35,348 --> 02:02:36,474
Di!

1955
02:02:36,515 --> 02:02:37,812
Ki!

1956
02:02:37,850 --> 02:02:39,010
Be right back.

1957
02:02:43,089 --> 02:02:44,454
What's up?

1958
02:02:44,490 --> 02:02:46,219
Can I help you?

1959
02:02:46,258 --> 02:02:47,418
I'm going to get a dozen.

1960
02:02:52,698 --> 02:02:54,962
Let me get
a couple of bear claws...

1961
02:02:58,104 --> 02:02:59,264
and...

1962
02:03:00,706 --> 02:03:02,071
a couple glazed.

1963
02:03:04,677 --> 02:03:06,508
Oh, apple fritter.

1964
02:03:06,545 --> 02:03:08,536
Not that one.
The one in front of it.

1965
02:03:08,581 --> 02:03:09,775
That one.

1966
02:03:15,688 --> 02:03:17,121
Two chocolate.

1967
02:03:19,892 --> 02:03:22,224
Old-fashioned, yeah.
Give me two of those.

1968
02:03:25,064 --> 02:03:26,827
Is this...

1969
02:03:26,866 --> 02:03:29,892
Did you do this
for the Christmas?

1970
02:03:29,935 --> 02:03:31,334
That's cute.

1971
02:03:31,370 --> 02:03:35,136
Give me two of those sprinkly
christmas things.

1972
02:03:37,510 --> 02:03:38,841
That's great.

1973
02:03:42,615 --> 02:03:44,810
- How many is that?
- That's eleven.

1974
02:03:48,954 --> 02:03:50,922
Empty the cash register!

1975
02:03:50,956 --> 02:03:52,685
Now, motherfucker, and hurry up!

1976
02:03:52,725 --> 02:03:53,851
Jesus Christ.

1977
02:03:53,893 --> 02:03:57,795
Shut the fuck up!
Hurry up with that shit!

1978
02:04:02,735 --> 02:04:05,397
Empty the safe, too, asshole.

1979
02:04:08,808 --> 02:04:10,207
And I ain't got all night.

1980
02:04:13,245 --> 02:04:14,803
Don't even move.

1981
02:04:14,847 --> 02:04:16,508
I'm not moving.

1982
02:04:16,549 --> 02:04:17,811
Shut up!

1983
02:04:22,655 --> 02:04:24,213
Don't fucking move.

1984
02:04:24,256 --> 02:04:25,382
I'm not...

1985
02:04:25,424 --> 02:04:27,619
Shut the fuck up.

1986
02:04:27,660 --> 02:04:30,424
Don't do that.

1987
02:04:30,463 --> 02:04:32,954
You shut the fuck up!

1988
02:04:32,998 --> 02:04:34,488
Give me the shit.

1989
02:05:25,484 --> 02:05:27,509
This could be the thing...

1990
02:05:27,553 --> 02:05:29,817
something to help us
score a little extra cash.

1991
02:05:29,855 --> 02:05:32,449
The guy's name is Rahad Jackson.

1992
02:05:32,491 --> 02:05:34,118
He's got more money than God.

1993
02:05:34,159 --> 02:05:35,922
He's got twice as much
coke, crank, and smack.

1994
02:05:35,961 --> 02:05:37,223
All right?

1995
02:05:37,263 --> 02:05:40,824
This guy's going to buy anything
anybody wants to sell him.

1996
02:05:40,866 --> 02:05:42,834
Just likes people
hanging around at his house...

1997
02:05:42,868 --> 02:05:44,165
partying, the whole thing.

1998
02:05:44,203 --> 02:05:45,636
How do you know him?

1999
02:05:45,671 --> 02:05:49,163
Used to come to the Party Boys
a lot. Mutrix introduced me.

2000
02:05:49,208 --> 02:05:51,802
How would we do it exactly?
How would it all go down?

2001
02:05:51,844 --> 02:05:52,970
It's going to go down like this.

2002
02:05:53,012 --> 02:05:55,947
I'm going to call him
on the phone and tell him...

2003
02:05:55,981 --> 02:05:58,142
I got a half a key
of quality stuff.

2004
02:05:58,183 --> 02:05:59,514
Do you have his phone number?

2005
02:06:02,154 --> 02:06:03,815
So I'm going
to call him on the phone.

2006
02:06:03,856 --> 02:06:05,187
I'm going to give him a price.

2007
02:06:05,224 --> 02:06:06,851
How much?

2008
02:06:06,892 --> 02:06:09,190
It's half a key.
It's, like, 5,000 bucks.

2009
02:06:09,228 --> 02:06:11,196
We'll split that up three ways.

2010
02:06:11,230 --> 02:06:13,198
It's enough to get
the 'vette fixed.

2011
02:06:13,232 --> 02:06:14,597
That's right.

2012
02:06:14,633 --> 02:06:16,430
So we're going to do the deal.

2013
02:06:16,468 --> 02:06:18,663
We're going to drop half a key
of baking soda into a bag.

2014
02:06:18,704 --> 02:06:21,798
We're going to walk over there.
We're going to...

2015
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:23,205
Right there.

2016
02:06:23,242 --> 02:06:26,473
This is going to be a nifty
little bit of hustle-bustle.

2017
02:06:26,512 --> 02:06:28,639
Do you have his address?

2018
02:06:28,681 --> 02:06:31,206
I got his fucking address.

2019
02:06:31,250 --> 02:06:33,480
Question. Sorry.

2020
02:06:33,519 --> 02:06:36,545
What if he tests the stuff out?

2021
02:06:36,589 --> 02:06:38,056
He won't.

2022
02:06:38,090 --> 02:06:39,853
How do you know that?

2023
02:06:39,892 --> 02:06:42,486
Because I know he won't.

2024
02:06:42,528 --> 02:06:43,790
I'm positive.

2025
02:06:43,829 --> 02:06:45,922
You guys should be careful.

2026
02:06:46,999 --> 02:06:48,728
What?

2027
02:06:48,767 --> 02:06:49,961
What do you mean, what?

2028
02:06:50,002 --> 02:06:52,129
Just mind your business.

2029
02:06:52,171 --> 02:06:53,638
What the fuck?

2030
02:06:53,672 --> 02:06:55,503
Sorry.

2031
02:06:55,541 --> 02:06:57,668
Anyway...

2032
02:06:57,710 --> 02:06:59,678
Dump it in there good.

2033
02:07:01,747 --> 02:07:03,612
You can't lay this all on me.

2034
02:07:03,649 --> 02:07:05,776
We're going to go in there.

2035
02:07:05,818 --> 02:07:07,649
This is it. Fine.

2036
02:07:09,655 --> 02:07:11,782
You guys ready for this?

2037
02:07:11,824 --> 02:07:13,792
I am.

2038
02:07:13,826 --> 02:07:14,952
Me?

2039
02:07:14,994 --> 02:07:16,621
I was born ready.

2040
02:07:16,662 --> 02:07:18,596
All right.

2041
02:07:18,631 --> 02:07:20,599
What the fuck is that?

2042
02:07:20,633 --> 02:07:22,624
- It's a big gun.
- But why?

2043
02:07:22,668 --> 02:07:24,101
Just in case.

2044
02:07:24,136 --> 02:07:25,433
Shit!

2045
02:07:26,905 --> 02:07:29,567
You never said anything
about a gun.

2046
02:07:29,608 --> 02:07:30,973
Now I'm getting nervous.
Do you have a gun, too?

2047
02:07:31,010 --> 02:07:32,978
I don't have a gun.

2048
02:07:33,012 --> 02:07:35,480
Let's just get
in and out, all right?

2049
02:07:35,514 --> 02:07:37,846
Not too fast.
It makes it look suspicious.

2050
02:07:37,883 --> 02:07:40,147
God damn it.

2051
02:07:40,185 --> 02:07:42,016
You all right?

2052
02:07:42,054 --> 02:07:44,488
Just let me do all the talking.

2053
02:07:44,523 --> 02:07:46,013
Just be cool.

2054
02:07:57,069 --> 02:07:59,731
How you doing? Come on in.

2055
02:08:06,545 --> 02:08:08,513
Hey, man!

2056
02:08:22,061 --> 02:08:24,529
Hey, Rahad.

2057
02:08:24,563 --> 02:08:26,554
Hello, friends!

2058
02:08:27,766 --> 02:08:29,461
Which one is Todd?

2059
02:08:29,501 --> 02:08:33,164
That's me. We met before,
down at the Party Boys.

2060
02:08:33,205 --> 02:08:35,332
Come on in.

2061
02:08:35,374 --> 02:08:37,842
These are my friends
Dirk and Reed.

2062
02:08:37,876 --> 02:08:40,344
Good to see you. Take a seat.

2063
02:08:40,379 --> 02:08:43,246
You want something to drink?
A little pill, a little coke?

2064
02:08:43,282 --> 02:08:46,376
You sure
you don't want something?

2065
02:08:46,418 --> 02:08:47,715
So...

2066
02:08:47,753 --> 02:08:49,345
got something?

2067
02:08:49,388 --> 02:08:51,549
We got something here?

2068
02:08:51,590 --> 02:08:52,852
Here it is.

2069
02:08:52,891 --> 02:08:55,086
That's about half a key there.

2070
02:08:55,127 --> 02:08:58,756
That is some quality shit...

2071
02:08:58,797 --> 02:09:00,458
Don't worry about him.

2072
02:09:00,499 --> 02:09:02,194
If you want to test that out...

2073
02:09:02,234 --> 02:09:03,861
Wait.

2074
02:09:06,105 --> 02:09:07,572
Love this part.

2075
02:09:12,678 --> 02:09:15,943
You're motorin'

2076
02:09:15,981 --> 02:09:20,008
What's your price for flight?

2077
02:09:20,052 --> 02:09:22,282
So anyway, what's the price?

2078
02:09:28,727 --> 02:09:30,024
We...

2079
02:09:37,736 --> 02:09:40,967
I don't know... five grand?

2080
02:09:47,613 --> 02:09:49,581
That's cool.

2081
02:09:55,521 --> 02:09:56,715
Five grand.

2082
02:10:18,977 --> 02:10:20,842
You guys want to play baseball?

2083
02:10:20,879 --> 02:10:22,574
No, thank you.

2084
02:10:25,150 --> 02:10:27,277
The black guy
has a gun in his jacket.

2085
02:10:37,196 --> 02:10:39,721
Let's just get the fuck
out of here.

2086
02:10:39,765 --> 02:10:41,630
Count the money in the car.

2087
02:10:58,217 --> 02:11:01,209
You want to see something
really fascinating?

2088
02:11:06,258 --> 02:11:07,623
Check it out.

2089
02:11:07,659 --> 02:11:10,025
That's sweet.

2090
02:11:10,062 --> 02:11:12,656
That thing's not loaded, is it?

2091
02:11:12,698 --> 02:11:14,131
- Not yet.
- Is that silver?

2092
02:11:14,166 --> 02:11:18,330
- Look, we...
- Let's see what happens now.

2093
02:11:18,370 --> 02:11:20,930
Could you not point the gun,
please?

2094
02:11:24,576 --> 02:11:26,043
Why? You think I can't do it?

2095
02:11:26,078 --> 02:11:27,306
Wait!

2096
02:11:27,346 --> 02:11:29,746
You think I can't do it?

2097
02:11:29,781 --> 02:11:31,305
You dare me?

2098
02:11:31,350 --> 02:11:33,682
No, we don't dare you!

2099
02:11:33,719 --> 02:11:35,744
Fucking dare me!

2100
02:11:40,559 --> 02:11:42,288
Thank you. Thank you.

2101
02:11:45,264 --> 02:11:47,425
Your fucking faces.

2102
02:11:50,602 --> 02:11:52,092
What the fuck?

2103
02:11:54,339 --> 02:11:57,001
I love this thing.
I make these little mix tapes.

2104
02:11:57,042 --> 02:11:59,010
I put all my favorite songs
together.

2105
02:11:59,044 --> 02:12:00,944
Which one is this?
Number eleven.

2106
02:12:00,979 --> 02:12:02,606
I love it.

2107
02:12:02,648 --> 02:12:04,775
When you buy
a tape or an album...

2108
02:12:04,816 --> 02:12:07,614
the bands put the songs
in some fucking order...

2109
02:12:07,653 --> 02:12:09,780
like they want you
to listen to it in that order.

2110
02:12:09,821 --> 02:12:12,289
I hate that.

2111
02:12:12,324 --> 02:12:14,189
I don't like to be told
what to listen to...

2112
02:12:14,226 --> 02:12:16,558
when to listen to it...

2113
02:12:27,940 --> 02:12:29,601
It's Cosmo.

2114
02:12:29,641 --> 02:12:31,199
He's Chinese.

2115
02:12:32,177 --> 02:12:34,202
That's why he likes
lighting off firecrackers.

2116
02:12:47,826 --> 02:12:50,727
Jessie is a friend

2117
02:12:50,762 --> 02:12:54,892
Yeah, I know he's been
a good friend of mine

2118
02:12:54,933 --> 02:12:58,562
But something's changed,
it ain't hard to define

2119
02:12:58,603 --> 02:13:00,264
Jessie's got himself a girl

2120
02:13:00,305 --> 02:13:02,102
And I want to make her mine

2121
02:13:02,140 --> 02:13:05,268
And she's watchin' him
with those eyes

2122
02:13:05,310 --> 02:13:07,744
And she's lovin' him
with that body

2123
02:13:07,779 --> 02:13:09,542
I just know it

2124
02:13:09,581 --> 02:13:12,072
Ricky Springfield.
He's a buddy of mine.

2125
02:13:12,117 --> 02:13:13,812
...late at night

2126
02:13:13,852 --> 02:13:16,616
You know,
I wish that I had Jessie's girl

2127
02:13:16,655 --> 02:13:17,781
I'm so jealous.

2128
02:13:17,823 --> 02:13:20,223
I want to have Jessie's girl

2129
02:13:20,258 --> 02:13:22,624
She should be with me!

2130
02:13:22,661 --> 02:13:25,926
Why can't I have a woman
like that?

2131
02:13:26,798 --> 02:13:29,198
I play along with the charade...

2132
02:13:29,234 --> 02:13:30,758
We're leaving.

2133
02:13:32,904 --> 02:13:34,565
Right?

2134
02:13:34,606 --> 02:13:37,632
You know, I feel so dirty
when they start talking cute

2135
02:13:37,676 --> 02:13:39,268
I want to tell her
that I love her

2136
02:13:39,311 --> 02:13:41,302
But the point is probably moot

2137
02:13:41,346 --> 02:13:44,804
'Cause she's watchin' him
with those eyes

2138
02:13:44,850 --> 02:13:46,943
And she's lovin' him
with that body

2139
02:13:46,985 --> 02:13:48,509
I just know it

2140
02:13:48,553 --> 02:13:52,785
And he's holdin' her
in his arms late, late at night

2141
02:13:52,824 --> 02:13:56,988
You know,
I wish that I had Jessie's girl

2142
02:13:57,029 --> 02:13:59,998
I wish that I had Jessie's girl

2143
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:04,933
Where can I find a woman
like that

2144
02:14:04,970 --> 02:14:07,996
Like Jessie's girl?

2145
02:14:08,040 --> 02:14:10,804
I wish that I had Jessie's girl

2146
02:14:12,978 --> 02:14:15,344
Where can I find a woman

2147
02:14:15,380 --> 02:14:16,506
We're leaving.

2148
02:14:16,548 --> 02:14:18,709
We got to split.

2149
02:14:18,750 --> 02:14:20,240
We got to go.

2150
02:14:20,285 --> 02:14:22,776
You just got here.

2151
02:14:22,821 --> 02:14:24,379
We got somewhere else to go.

2152
02:14:27,159 --> 02:14:28,820
We're not leaving yet.

2153
02:14:31,997 --> 02:14:35,057
We're here now, and we want
something else from you.

2154
02:14:41,673 --> 02:14:44,039
We want something else from you.

2155
02:14:44,076 --> 02:14:45,634
What?

2156
02:14:45,677 --> 02:14:48,202
What the hell are you doing?
Let's just go.

2157
02:14:50,315 --> 02:14:51,509
In the master bedroom...

2158
02:14:53,418 --> 02:14:54,680
under the bed...

2159
02:14:54,719 --> 02:14:56,118
in a floor safe.

2160
02:14:57,255 --> 02:14:58,745
Understand?

2161
02:14:58,790 --> 02:15:01,782
What is the matter with you?
Let's go.

2162
02:15:01,827 --> 02:15:03,260
Shut up, Dirk.

2163
02:15:03,295 --> 02:15:05,889
I told you I got a plan.

2164
02:15:05,931 --> 02:15:08,195
Are you kidding me, Kitty?

2165
02:15:08,233 --> 02:15:09,791
No, I'm not.

2166
02:15:09,835 --> 02:15:13,566
I'm not kidding.
I want what's in the safe.

2167
02:15:13,605 --> 02:15:15,163
We want
what is in the goddamn safe...

2168
02:15:15,207 --> 02:15:17,175
in the goddamn master bedroom...

2169
02:15:17,209 --> 02:15:20,406
in the goddamn fucking
floor safe.

2170
02:15:20,445 --> 02:15:21,969
Don't be crazy, OK?

2171
02:15:22,013 --> 02:15:23,674
We don't know anything
about this.

2172
02:15:23,715 --> 02:15:25,649
This is not at all
what we wanted.

2173
02:15:25,684 --> 02:15:29,017
Shut the fuck up.
Do not reach for your gun.

2174
02:15:29,054 --> 02:15:30,885
Don't reach for your gun!

2175
02:15:44,636 --> 02:15:46,297
He went in the bedroom!

2176
02:15:46,338 --> 02:15:48,670
What are you doing?

2177
02:15:48,707 --> 02:15:50,299
He went in the bedroom.

2178
02:15:50,342 --> 02:15:52,936
Did you go crazy?

2179
02:15:52,978 --> 02:15:55,845
He's got coke, and he's got cash
in that safe...

2180
02:15:55,881 --> 02:15:58,247
and if we leave here without it,
we're idiots.

2181
02:15:58,283 --> 02:16:00,274
We came here to do something...

2182
02:16:00,318 --> 02:16:03,185
and we can do it, all right?
Are you with me?

2183
02:16:03,221 --> 02:16:07,715
Listen to me!
Let's just split right now.

2184
02:16:07,759 --> 02:16:09,750
This is not supposed
to be the thing!

2185
02:16:09,794 --> 02:16:12,888
That's what
we came here to do...

2186
02:16:12,931 --> 02:16:16,526
and that's what
I'm going to do right now.

2187
02:16:16,568 --> 02:16:17,694
Fuck you!

2188
02:16:17,736 --> 02:16:20,705
Don't be stupid!

2189
02:16:23,875 --> 02:16:25,900
Come on!

2190
02:16:25,944 --> 02:16:27,605
Come on, you puppies!

2191
02:16:31,816 --> 02:16:33,716
It's coming down for puppies!

2192
02:16:43,261 --> 02:16:44,956
Come back!

2193
02:16:56,975 --> 02:16:58,306
Shit!

2194
02:17:13,692 --> 02:17:16,559
Fucking son of a bitch!

2195
02:17:16,595 --> 02:17:18,256
Oh, God.

2196
02:17:18,296 --> 02:17:19,456
Oh, fuck!

2197
02:17:21,866 --> 02:17:24,801
Fucking stupid motherfucker!

2198
02:17:35,580 --> 02:17:37,104
Bitch.

2199
02:18:34,039 --> 02:18:35,404
Could you please help me?

2200
02:18:45,583 --> 02:18:47,073
I'm...

2201
02:18:59,130 --> 02:19:02,224
I just wanted to come
and say sorry.

2202
02:19:02,267 --> 02:19:03,825
And...

2203
02:19:06,871 --> 02:19:09,339
I just want to know
if you can help me.

2204
02:19:11,976 --> 02:19:13,603
I need help.

2205
02:19:15,747 --> 02:19:16,907
And...

2206
02:19:17,982 --> 02:19:19,745
I'm sorry, you know?

2207
02:19:23,822 --> 02:19:25,312
I need help.

2208
02:19:44,175 --> 02:19:45,767
I'm sorry, too, kid.

2209
02:19:48,246 --> 02:19:50,214
It's OK, baby.

2210
02:19:50,248 --> 02:19:53,217
We all need to start again.

2211
02:19:58,022 --> 02:19:59,751
It's OK.

2212
02:20:10,902 --> 02:20:12,164
You're all right, baby.

2213
02:20:20,478 --> 02:20:22,878
Did I hear someone say deal?

2214
02:20:22,914 --> 02:20:25,348
This weekend
and this weekend only...

2215
02:20:25,383 --> 02:20:28,045
Buck's Super Cool Stereo Store
is making super-cool deals...

2216
02:20:28,086 --> 02:20:29,951
on all name brands.

2217
02:20:29,988 --> 02:20:31,649
We're open. We're ready.

2218
02:20:31,689 --> 02:20:35,056
All you need to do is walk over,
get down, and come inside us.

2219
02:20:37,128 --> 02:20:38,959
Word.

2220
02:20:38,997 --> 02:20:40,294
Cut.

2221
02:20:40,331 --> 02:20:41,855
Excellent.

2222
02:20:41,900 --> 02:20:43,925
That was great.

2223
02:21:00,518 --> 02:21:02,418
I said shut up, Colonel!

2224
02:21:14,799 --> 02:21:15,925
Cinco...

2225
02:21:15,967 --> 02:21:17,730
cuatro...

2226
02:21:17,769 --> 02:21:18,895
tres...

2227
02:21:18,937 --> 02:21:20,063
dos...

2228
02:21:20,104 --> 02:21:21,230
uno...

2229
02:21:21,272 --> 02:21:22,432
Dale!

2230
02:21:34,085 --> 02:21:35,245
Wait!

2231
02:21:37,455 --> 02:21:40,481
No, that's a "Q"!
That's supposed to be a "G"!

2232
02:21:40,525 --> 02:21:42,254
Oh, man!

2233
02:22:04,749 --> 02:22:05,909
Go!

2234
02:22:11,356 --> 02:22:12,687
What the heck?

2235
02:22:14,325 --> 02:22:16,088
Naughty, naughty, Candi.

2236
02:22:20,632 --> 02:22:21,826
Let's push.

2237
02:22:23,234 --> 02:22:24,360
Come on, baby.

2238
02:22:24,402 --> 02:22:26,597
Go, go, go. Push, push, push.

2239
02:22:28,840 --> 02:22:31,604
God almighty, fucking Christ!

2240
02:22:31,643 --> 02:22:34,339
Don't cuss, sweetie.
Just push, all right?

2241
02:22:34,379 --> 02:22:37,246
Last big push for the doctor.
Big push. This is it.

2242
02:22:38,616 --> 02:22:39,776
I got it!

2243
02:22:41,886 --> 02:22:43,012
He got it!

2244
02:22:43,054 --> 02:22:44,248
It's a boy!

2245
02:22:52,564 --> 02:22:55,362
No hurry.
Just sometime this year, huh?

2246
02:22:56,868 --> 02:22:58,495
Put it where I told you
to put it.

2247
02:23:04,342 --> 02:23:06,071
You've got to turn the fan on.

2248
02:23:06,110 --> 02:23:07,839
It smells good, doesn't it?

2249
02:23:07,879 --> 02:23:09,779
It smells like shit.

2250
02:23:09,814 --> 02:23:11,907
This is Puerto Rican cooking.

2251
02:23:11,950 --> 02:23:14,180
Everybody's complaining
in the whole neighborhood.

2252
02:23:14,218 --> 02:23:16,277
This is what they're
complaining about. Taste this.

2253
02:23:16,321 --> 02:23:18,414
Not now. I'll taste it later.

2254
02:23:23,895 --> 02:23:25,795
Honey, honey.

2255
02:23:25,830 --> 02:23:27,661
Take the dirt
on one side of your room...

2256
02:23:27,699 --> 02:23:29,291
and move it
to the other side of your room.

2257
02:23:29,334 --> 02:23:31,894
Then one side will look clean
that used to look dirty.

2258
02:23:31,936 --> 02:23:33,335
Then that will be good, huh?

2259
02:23:36,207 --> 02:23:38,004
Johnny Weissmuller!

2260
02:23:38,042 --> 02:23:39,304
That's my swimmer!

2261
02:23:39,344 --> 02:23:41,369
Say, "Hello, Uncle Jack."

2262
02:23:45,984 --> 02:23:48,748
Who is the olympic-fever baby?

2263
02:23:50,722 --> 02:23:52,053
Say, "Hi, Jack."

2264
02:23:53,658 --> 02:23:54,852
"Watch me kick."

2265
02:23:54,892 --> 02:23:55,984
He's not going
to piss in the pool?

2266
02:23:56,027 --> 02:23:57,426
I don't think so.

2267
02:24:02,634 --> 02:24:03,760
I got to talk to you...

2268
02:24:03,801 --> 02:24:05,268
about the stereo modification
for this system.

2269
02:24:05,303 --> 02:24:06,827
No technical shit.

2270
02:24:06,871 --> 02:24:08,361
If you don't get
the right modification...

2271
02:24:08,406 --> 02:24:10,670
it's not going to be loud.

2272
02:24:10,708 --> 02:24:13,233
I don't want loud. I want...

2273
02:24:13,277 --> 02:24:14,938
Mellow.

2274
02:24:14,979 --> 02:24:16,503
That's what I want.

2275
02:24:23,721 --> 02:24:25,188
Great, honey.

2276
02:24:35,867 --> 02:24:37,835
Are we ready?

2277
02:24:37,869 --> 02:24:40,895
We've got all the time we want.

2278
02:24:42,507 --> 02:24:44,941
What are you looking at?

2279
02:24:44,976 --> 02:24:46,568
I'm looking at you.

2280
02:24:46,611 --> 02:24:48,135
You're staring.

2281
02:24:48,179 --> 02:24:49,373
You know what I'm staring at?

2282
02:24:51,282 --> 02:24:56,276
I'm staring at the foxiest bitch
in the whole world.

2283
02:25:25,750 --> 02:25:28,241
I've been around this block
twice now.

2284
02:25:28,286 --> 02:25:30,345
I'm looking for something.

2285
02:25:30,388 --> 02:25:32,447
A clue.

2286
02:25:32,490 --> 02:25:35,118
Been looking for clues,
and something led me back here.

2287
02:25:36,994 --> 02:25:39,258
So here I am.

2288
02:25:39,297 --> 02:25:40,992
Could have been me
that was at Ringo's place...

2289
02:25:41,032 --> 02:25:42,499
when the shit went down.

2290
02:25:44,335 --> 02:25:47,270
I know how it is.
I've been there.

2291
02:25:47,305 --> 02:25:49,739
We've all done bad things.

2292
02:25:49,774 --> 02:25:53,141
We've all had those guilty
feelings in our heart.

2293
02:25:53,177 --> 02:25:54,610
You want to take
your brain out of your head...

2294
02:25:54,645 --> 02:25:56,977
and wash it and make it clean.

2295
02:26:01,652 --> 02:26:04,086
I'm going to help you
settle this.

2296
02:26:04,122 --> 02:26:07,182
First we're going to check
for holes, see what we can find.

2297
02:26:07,225 --> 02:26:09,352
Then we're going
to get nice and wet...

2298
02:26:09,393 --> 02:26:12,123
and you're going
to spread your legs.

2299
02:26:12,163 --> 02:26:13,790
That's good.

2300
02:26:13,831 --> 02:26:15,856
So you know me.

2301
02:26:15,900 --> 02:26:18,130
You know my reputation.

2302
02:26:18,169 --> 02:26:21,935
Thirteen inches is a tough load.
I don't treat you gently.

2303
02:26:21,973 --> 02:26:23,770
That's right.

2304
02:26:23,808 --> 02:26:25,400
I'm Brock Landers.

2305
02:26:26,711 --> 02:26:28,269
So I'm going to be nice.

2306
02:26:36,354 --> 02:26:38,788
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

2307
02:26:38,823 --> 02:26:41,223
Where the fuck is Ringo?

2308
02:27:06,617 --> 02:27:08,084
I am a star.

2309
02:27:11,923 --> 02:27:14,517
I am a big, bright,
shining star.

2310
02:27:31,275 --> 02:27:32,435
That's right.
