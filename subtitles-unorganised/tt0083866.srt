01:25:51,793 --> 01:25:55,354
what does it do?

1011
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:59,059
The communicator?

1012
01:25:59,134 --> 01:26:02,035
Is it still working?

1013
01:26:02,103 --> 01:26:05,163
It's doing something.

1014
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,037
What?

1015
01:26:07,108 --> 01:26:10,407
I really
shouldn't tell.

1016
01:26:10,479 --> 01:26:12,913
He came to me.

1017
01:26:12,981 --> 01:26:16,382
He came to me.

1018
01:26:16,451 --> 01:26:19,887
Elliott,
he came to me, too.

1019
01:26:19,955 --> 01:26:21,889
I've been
wishing for this

1020
01:26:21,957 --> 01:26:24,391
since I was
1 0 years old.

1021
01:26:24,459 --> 01:26:26,893
I don't want him
to die.

1022
01:26:26,962 --> 01:26:30,557
What can we do that
we're not already doing?

1023
01:26:30,632 --> 01:26:35,365
He needs to go home.

1024
01:26:35,437 --> 01:26:39,032
He's calling
his people...

1025
01:26:39,107 --> 01:26:43,669
and I don't know
where they are.

1026
01:26:43,745 --> 01:26:46,441
He needs to go home.

1027
01:26:46,515 --> 01:26:48,278
Elliott, I don't think

1028
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:51,046
that he was left here
intentionally.

1029
01:26:53,522 --> 01:26:57,424
But his being here
is a miracle, Elliott.

1030
01:26:57,492 --> 01:27:00,461
It's a miracle,

1031
01:27:00,529 --> 01:27:04,124
and you did the best
that anybody could do.

1032
01:27:07,002 --> 01:27:09,630
I'm glad
he met you first.

1033
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:20,012
He's got DNA.

1034
01:27:20,081 --> 01:27:21,480
Incredible.

1035
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:23,017
He's got DNA!

1036
01:27:23,051 --> 01:27:25,281
He doesn't have
four nucleotides like we do.

1037
01:27:25,353 --> 01:27:27,821
He has six.
Desynchronization
of the two brain waves.

1038
01:27:30,892 --> 01:27:31,824
E.T.!

1039
01:27:31,893 --> 01:27:33,861
The boy's condition
is stabilizing.

1040
01:27:33,929 --> 01:27:35,453
Blood pressure's
back up.

1041
01:27:37,032 --> 01:27:39,364
E.T.

1042
01:27:39,434 --> 01:27:41,925
Elliott.

1043
01:27:42,003 --> 01:27:43,664
He's speaking.
He's talking.

1044
01:27:43,738 --> 01:27:45,865
E.T...

1045
01:27:45,941 --> 01:27:48,603
stay with me.

1046
01:27:50,111 --> 01:27:51,305
Please.

1047
01:27:51,379 --> 01:27:53,540
Stay...

1048
01:27:53,615 --> 01:27:54,946
Together.

1049
01:27:55,016 --> 01:27:58,713
I'll be right here.

1050
01:27:58,787 --> 01:28:02,120
I'll be right here.

1051
01:28:03,792 --> 01:28:06,352
Stay...

1052
01:28:06,428 --> 01:28:11,195
Elliott.

1053
01:28:11,266 --> 01:28:13,291
Stay.

1054
01:28:14,469 --> 01:28:16,767
Stay.

1055
01:28:19,007 --> 01:28:22,909
Stay.

1056
01:28:22,978 --> 01:28:25,378
Stay.

1057
01:28:25,447 --> 01:28:28,143
The creature's pressure
is bottoming out.

1058
01:28:28,216 --> 01:28:29,547
How's the boy?

1059
01:28:29,618 --> 01:28:32,985
He's converting back
to normal sinus rhythm.

1060
01:28:34,422 --> 01:28:35,354
They're separating.

1061
01:28:35,423 --> 01:28:37,721
Boy and creature
are separating.

1062
01:28:37,792 --> 01:28:39,225
What does
that mean?

1063
01:28:39,294 --> 01:28:41,694
The boy's coming back.
We're losing E.T.

1064
01:28:41,763 --> 01:28:45,790
E.T., answer me, please.

1065
01:28:45,867 --> 01:28:47,494
Please.

1066
01:28:47,569 --> 01:28:49,537
Just relax.

1067
01:29:57,205 --> 01:29:58,570
No!

1068
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,198
E.T., don't go!

1069
01:30:00,275 --> 01:30:01,674
No blood pressure.

1070
01:30:01,743 --> 01:30:04,177
He's got no pulse
or respiration.

1071
01:30:04,245 --> 01:30:07,180
We can't
get a pulse
or blood pressure.

1072
01:30:07,248 --> 01:30:09,614
It doesn't look
like he's breathing.

1073
01:30:09,684 --> 01:30:12,050
[Groaning]

1074
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:13,917
Leave him alone!

1075
01:30:13,988 --> 01:30:16,047
You're killing him!

1076
01:30:16,124 --> 01:30:17,557
Leave him alone!

1077
01:30:17,625 --> 01:30:19,456
Let's move it!

1078
01:30:19,527 --> 01:30:21,586
Get the boy out.

1079
01:30:21,663 --> 01:30:23,961
Stop it!
You're killing him!

1080
01:30:24,032 --> 01:30:25,761
You're killing him!

1081
01:30:25,834 --> 01:30:27,893
Let's go.
Move it out.

1082
01:30:27,969 --> 01:30:30,403
You're killing him!
You're killing him!

1083
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:33,805
You're killing him!
He came to me!

1084
01:30:33,875 --> 01:30:35,866
Let's ventilate him.
Any pulses?

1085
01:30:35,944 --> 01:30:37,070
Move it.

1086
01:30:37,145 --> 01:30:39,045
He came to me!

1087
01:30:39,114 --> 01:30:40,206
Let's start.

1088
01:30:40,281 --> 01:30:41,976
60 per minute.

1089
01:30:44,619 --> 01:30:46,177
Minimal breath sounds.

1090
01:30:46,254 --> 01:30:49,246
Calm down.
Calm down. Calm...

1091
01:30:51,159 --> 01:30:52,751
Let's try some
bertyllium.

1092
01:30:52,827 --> 01:30:54,795
Can we have
some bertyllium?

1093
01:30:54,863 --> 01:30:56,455
Getting a pulse?

1094
01:30:56,531 --> 01:30:57,555
5 milligrams.

1095
01:30:57,632 --> 01:30:59,930
Compressed air.
Compressed air's fine.

1096
01:31:00,001 --> 01:31:01,866
Thank you.

1097
01:31:01,936 --> 01:31:03,494
All IV push.

1098
01:31:03,571 --> 01:31:05,334
He's not ventilating.

1099
01:31:05,406 --> 01:31:08,432
His pupils are fixed
and dilated.

1100
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:09,477
More drugs.

1101
01:31:09,544 --> 01:31:10,442
Quiet.

1102
01:31:10,512 --> 01:31:12,412
Defibrillate him.

1103
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,641
Losing him.
We're losing him.

1104
01:31:14,716 --> 01:31:16,149
Let's go.

1105
01:31:16,217 --> 01:31:17,684
Everybody stand clear.

1106
01:31:17,752 --> 01:31:18,719
Clear.

1107
01:31:18,787 --> 01:31:20,482
We're losing him.

1108
01:31:20,555 --> 01:31:22,182
One more time.

1109
01:31:23,792 --> 01:31:24,690
Quiet!

1110
01:31:24,759 --> 01:31:26,226
It's still defib.

1111
01:31:26,294 --> 01:31:27,727
O.K., let's go.

1112
01:31:27,796 --> 01:31:29,320
Let's go.
Let's go.

1113
01:31:35,136 --> 01:31:37,195
Elliott?

1114
01:31:38,973 --> 01:31:40,201
Mom.

1115
01:31:51,686 --> 01:31:54,154
He needs calcium
in his body.

1116
01:31:54,222 --> 01:31:55,917
Let's continue CPR,
please.

1117
01:32:11,472 --> 01:32:13,497
Would you people
stand back?

1118
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:20,413
Something's
happening.

1119
01:32:20,481 --> 01:32:22,449
Ooh, they're
going to die.

1120
01:32:22,517 --> 01:32:23,916
Shut up, Greg.

1121
01:32:23,985 --> 01:32:25,850
Something is
definitely happening.

1122
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,319
Anybody have
any ideas?

1123
01:32:27,388 --> 01:32:29,288
EEG's flat.
EKG's flat.

1124
01:32:29,357 --> 01:32:31,825
O.K., I'm going
to call it.

1125
01:32:31,893 --> 01:32:33,292
I think he's dead.

1126
01:32:33,361 --> 01:32:34,794
No. I don't know.

1127
01:32:34,863 --> 01:32:36,831
What time
do you have?

1128
01:32:36,898 --> 01:32:37,796
1 5:36.

1129
01:32:37,866 --> 01:32:40,391
1 5 hours,
36 minutes.

1130
01:32:40,468 --> 01:32:41,935
O.K.

1131
01:32:42,003 --> 01:32:44,267
Let's pack him in ice.

1132
01:32:45,807 --> 01:32:47,138
Let's leave.

1133
01:33:53,141 --> 01:33:56,338
Is he dead, mama?

1134
01:33:56,411 --> 01:33:58,504
I think so,
sweetheart.

1135
01:33:58,579 --> 01:34:02,515
Can we wish
for him to come back?

1136
01:34:02,583 --> 01:34:04,517
Yeah.

1137
01:34:04,585 --> 01:34:06,712
I wish.

1138
01:34:06,788 --> 01:34:08,779
I wish, too.

1139
01:34:17,498 --> 01:34:18,931
Come on, Gert.

1140
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,901
We'll wait for Elliott
in the front room.

1141
01:34:23,571 --> 01:34:25,129
Cardiac arrest
was terminated

1142
01:34:25,206 --> 01:34:28,505
at 1 500 hours
and 36 minutes.

1143
01:34:28,576 --> 01:34:31,409
He received
intravenous
lidocaine,

1144
01:34:31,479 --> 01:34:32,946
intravenous
epinephrine

1145
01:34:33,014 --> 01:34:34,447
on a lidocaine
drip,

1146
01:34:34,515 --> 01:34:37,040
2.7%
sodium-chloride
solution,

1147
01:34:37,118 --> 01:34:39,018
catheters from
the " A'' line.

1148
01:34:39,087 --> 01:34:40,554
And the
intravenous line

1149
01:34:40,621 --> 01:34:43,488
should be sent
for culture.

1150
01:34:43,558 --> 01:34:45,992
He was monitored
with a...

1151
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:49,393
EEG and an EKG,

1152
01:34:49,464 --> 01:34:51,295
he was
defibrillated.

1153
01:34:51,366 --> 01:34:54,301
They're going to have
to take him away now.

1154
01:34:54,369 --> 01:34:56,803
They'll just
cut him all up.

1155
01:34:56,871 --> 01:35:00,898
Would you like
to spend some time
alone with him?

1156
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:20,024
Could we all step out
for a minute, please?

1157
01:36:13,614 --> 01:36:16,606
Look at what
they've done to you.

1158
01:36:19,487 --> 01:36:21,421
I'm so sorry.

1159
01:36:26,994 --> 01:36:29,428
You must be dead...

1160
01:36:31,399 --> 01:36:32,559
because...

1161
01:36:32,633 --> 01:36:35,466
I don't know
how to feel.

1162
01:36:39,006 --> 01:36:41,531
I can't feel
anything anymore.

1163
01:36:43,978 --> 01:36:47,311
You've gone
someplace else now.

1164
01:36:54,655 --> 01:36:57,818
I'll believe in you
all my life.

1165
01:36:59,327 --> 01:37:00,954
Every day.

1166
01:37:05,533 --> 01:37:06,830
E.T...

1167
01:37:10,071 --> 01:37:11,595
I love you.

1168
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:45,000
Oh, my God.

1169
01:37:51,345 --> 01:37:53,905
E.T. phone home.

1170
01:37:53,981 --> 01:37:55,881
Ah ha!

1171
01:37:55,950 --> 01:37:57,781
Phone home.

1172
01:37:57,852 --> 01:37:59,376
Phone home.

1173
01:37:59,453 --> 01:38:01,580
Does this mean
they're coming?

Shut up.

Phone home.

1182
01:38:14,402 --> 01:38:15,426
Quiet!

1183
01:38:15,503 --> 01:38:16,595
Phone! Phone!

1184
01:38:16,671 --> 01:38:18,866
Would you shut up?

1185
01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:19,907
Phone home.

Elliott.

1195
01:38:32,086 --> 01:38:33,018
Stay.

1196
01:38:33,087 --> 01:38:34,111
Stay.

[Crying]

1199
01:38:44,565 --> 01:38:47,500
Elliott,
why don't you
come with me?

1200
01:38:47,568 --> 01:38:48,557
No.

1201
01:38:48,636 --> 01:38:51,002
Why don't you
come with me?

1202
01:38:51,072 --> 01:38:52,096
No.

1203
01:38:52,173 --> 01:38:53,265
No.

1204
01:38:53,341 --> 01:38:54,273
No. No.

1205
01:38:54,342 --> 01:38:55,673
It's all right.

1206
01:38:55,743 --> 01:38:56,767
No!

1207
01:39:00,948 --> 01:39:02,916
Would you like
the flower?

1208
01:39:02,984 --> 01:39:04,315
Aah!

1209
01:39:07,688 --> 01:39:09,349
He's alive!

1210
01:39:09,423 --> 01:39:10,913
He's alive!

1211
01:39:10,992 --> 01:39:11,890
All right!

1212
01:39:11,959 --> 01:39:13,756
It's glowing
right here.

1213
01:39:25,172 --> 01:39:27,140
Are they gone, mama?

1214
01:39:27,208 --> 01:39:28,607
Who's gone, honey?

1215
01:39:28,676 --> 01:39:29,768
The boys.

1216
01:39:29,844 --> 01:39:31,106
What boys?

1217
01:39:31,178 --> 01:39:35,615
I'm supposed to give you
this note when they're gone.

1218
01:39:35,683 --> 01:39:38,550
Give it to me now,
Gertie.

1219
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:47,855
Oh, my God.

1220
01:39:56,237 --> 01:39:58,762
Give me
a hand with this.

1221
01:40:05,479 --> 01:40:06,411
Aah!

1222
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:07,913
Where's your mask?

1223
01:40:07,982 --> 01:40:08,914
Back here.

1224
01:40:08,983 --> 01:40:10,917
Well, get it on!

1225
01:40:10,985 --> 01:40:12,282
I'm trying!

1226
01:40:17,692 --> 01:40:19,956
Hey, who are you?

1227
01:40:20,027 --> 01:40:21,961
I'm driving.

1228
01:40:23,898 --> 01:40:25,297
Open the door,
son.

1229
01:40:25,366 --> 01:40:27,630
Somebody's here.
What do I do?

1230
01:40:27,702 --> 01:40:31,160
What are you waiting for?
Let's go!

1231
01:40:31,238 --> 01:40:32,762
Let's get out of here!

1232
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:35,741
I've never driven
forward before!

1233

[Engine Starts]

1234
01:40:37,611 --> 01:40:38,805
Aah!

1235
01:40:43,217 --> 01:40:44,206
Get the bikes.

1236
01:40:44,285 --> 01:40:46,253
Meet us
at the playground

1237
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,652
at the top
of the hill.

1238
01:41:08,676 --> 01:41:11,941
We'll all die,
and I'll never
get my license.

1239
01:41:15,416 --> 01:41:16,883
Where's
the playground?

1240
01:41:16,951 --> 01:41:18,816
It's near the preschool!

1241
01:41:18,886 --> 01:41:19,910
Where's that?

1242
01:41:19,987 --> 01:41:21,352
I don't know streets.

1243
01:41:21,422 --> 01:41:23,413
Mom always drives me.

1244
01:41:23,491 --> 01:41:25,516
Son of a bitch.

1245
01:41:51,419 --> 01:41:52,647
Where are you going?

1246
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:54,051
To the spaceship.

1247
01:41:54,121 --> 01:41:55,213
Shh!

1248
01:41:55,289 --> 01:41:58,725
To the spaceship
to the moon.

1249
01:41:58,793 --> 01:41:59,817
Quiet!

1250
01:42:01,495 --> 01:42:03,258
Oh, my God.

1251
01:42:03,330 --> 01:42:05,696
Stop the van!

1252
01:42:09,637 --> 01:42:11,264
Don't pull it off!.

1253
01:42:24,418 --> 01:42:25,976
That did it!

1254
01:43:13,534 --> 01:43:16,560
O.K. He's a man
from outer space,

1255
01:43:16,637 --> 01:43:19,299
and we're taking him
to his spaceship.

1256
01:43:19,373 --> 01:43:22,001
Well, can't he
just beam up?

1257
01:43:22,076 --> 01:43:24,135
This is reality,
Greg.

1258
01:43:25,980 --> 01:43:27,379
Keep her back!

1259
01:43:27,448 --> 01:43:28,415
No!

1260
01:43:28,482 --> 01:43:29,881
Hold her back!

1261
01:43:31,852 --> 01:43:34,821
No! No! No! No!

1262
01:43:34,889 --> 01:43:36,356
Where are they?

1263
01:43:36,423 --> 01:43:38,152
There's nobody here.

1264
01:43:44,198 --> 01:43:45,756
Runff runff.

1265
01:43:45,833 --> 01:43:47,232
Where are we going?

1266
01:43:47,301 --> 01:43:48,825
To the forest!

1267
01:43:52,206 --> 01:43:53,537
Follow me!

1268
01:44:25,573 --> 01:44:27,905
We got them
at the hill.

1269
01:44:43,591 --> 01:44:45,058
This is Unit 302.

1270
01:44:45,125 --> 01:44:46,558
We've cut
the kids off

1271

at the bottom
of the hill.

Tell me when it's over!

Stop the car, Mama!

They're over there!

They're over there!

to say goodbye.

goodbye.

Be good.

Yes.

Ouch.
