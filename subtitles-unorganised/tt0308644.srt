(orchestra warming up)

00:00:16.58,00:00:19.04
(tapping of baton)

00:00:19.08,00:00:20.75
- (man) Lights up![br]- (man #2) Beginners, please!

00:00:21.08,00:00:23.04
- (man #3) Your five-minute call, sir.[br]- (man #1) Places.

00:00:23.08,00:00:25.46
(man #2) Places. Everyone to their places.

00:00:25.59,00:00:27.05
(man #1) Sh. Quiet, everyone.

00:00:27.09,00:00:29.55
(man) Opening nights?[br]I love opening nights.

00:00:29.59,00:00:30.93
(laughter)

00:00:31.09,00:00:33.55
- How are you? Good to see you.[br]- (man #2) Good evening, Charles.

00:00:33.59,00:00:35.14
- (Charles) Sir Herbert, how are you?[br]- This is my wife.

00:00:35.60,00:00:37.35
- Oh, Lady Herbert.[br]- How do you do?

00:00:37.35,00:00:38.14
May I give you a peck?

00:00:38.60,00:00:40.10
(Herbert) One of Mr Barrie's finest?

00:00:40.10,00:00:41.85
(Charles) Oh, that genius Scotsman[br]has done it again.

00:00:42.10,00:00:44.23
It's the best thing I've produced[br]in 25 years.

00:00:44.61,00:00:47.02
I already have investors interested[br]back home in New York.

00:00:47.07,00:00:50.74
- (Herbert) See you on Broadway![br]- (laughter)

00:01:04.58,00:01:07.34
(man) First positions, people.

00:01:08.59,00:01:11.26
(man #2) Standing by, please,[br]ladies and gentlemen.

00:01:11.59,00:01:13.84
If you could take[br]your opening positions, please.

00:01:18.10,00:01:21.93
Beginners, please take[br]your opening positions.

00:01:21.98,00:01:25.35
Audience are coming in. Standing by.

00:01:28.48,00:01:30.21
- Good audience.[br]- Sorry?

00:01:30.21,00:01:31.94
Good audience tonight.

00:01:31.99,00:01:34.36
OK. That's great, thank you.[br]How much longer?

00:01:34.49,00:01:36.66
Um, ten minutes, sir.

00:01:38.49,00:01:41.33
(Charles) I love opening nights.

00:01:41.50,00:01:43.83
I want to dance with your wife[br]at the after-party.

00:01:44.29,00:01:45.83
- Oh, my goodness.[br]- Good evening, Mr Frohman.

00:01:46.17,00:01:47.50
- How are you, John?[br]- V ery well.

00:01:47.50,00:01:50.25
(Charles) It's the best thing[br]that I've produced in 25 years.

00:01:50.50,00:01:52.47
- Hello, George. How are you?[br]- Healthy and wealthy, I see.

00:01:52.51,00:01:54.43
(Charles) You've rearranged a holiday[br]for me and I won't forget it.

00:01:54.47,00:01:55.93
- For you, Charles, anything.[br]- You won't regret it.

00:01:55.97,00:01:56.93
(John) I'm sure.

00:01:57.30,00:02:00.06
- Have you got the tickets?[br]- They're in my pocket.

00:02:00.81,00:02:03.93
- There's Mrs Barrie.[br]- Oh, Mr and Mrs Snow.

00:02:04.39,00:02:08.65
We were so hoping to speak[br]with your husband before the show.

00:02:08.90,00:02:12.23
- (Mr Snow) Have you seen him?[br]- I'm not sure where he is, actually.

00:02:20.37,00:02:22.45
(audience murmurs)

00:02:31.17,00:02:35.51
(Mrs Snow) We do miss seeing you[br]on stage. You were so wonderful.

00:02:35.51,00:02:39.85
Yes, well, it's been some time now.[br]Are you right to find your seat?

00:02:40.30,00:02:42.26
Oh, yes, yes.

00:02:42.31,00:02:45.35
See you at the party, then.

00:02:45.48,00:02:46.85
Excuse me. Could you find Mr Barrie

00:02:47.10,00:02:50.15
and remind him that they're doing his play[br]this evening.

00:02:50.15,00:02:52.86
- Yes, ma'am.[br]- Thank you.

00:03:13.80,00:03:14.84
(Charles) Let's close the doors.

00:03:47.00,00:03:48.96
(applause)

00:03:56.59,00:03:58.63
(actor) Really, I mustn't[br]inconvenience you in this way.

00:03:59.09,00:04:00.93
I can wait quite well in the shop.

00:04:01.09,00:04:05.56
'Tis no inconvenience.[br]The shop is chilly. And there is a fire here.

00:04:05.60,00:04:06.93
(actor #1) Really,[br]you are uncommonly good.

00:04:07.10,00:04:09.56
Sorry, sir.

00:04:09.60,00:04:12.73
Mrs Barrie wanted me to remind you[br]that the play's begun.

00:04:13.11,00:04:16.17
- Though I imagine you know that.[br]- They hate it.

00:04:16.17,00:04:19.24
- Sir?[br]- It's like a dentist's office out there. Why?

00:04:19.57,00:04:25.45
- I wouldn't say they hate it, sir.[br]- What do you think? Do you like it?

00:04:25.58,00:04:28.04
- I've just been hired here, sir.[br]- Yes or no? I'm not bothered.

00:04:28.08,00:04:32.46
- I'm not really qualified to...[br]- Do you like it? Is it crap?

00:04:32.58,00:04:34.84
- Crap, sir?[br]- Go on, say it. Just say it.

00:04:34.84,00:04:36.55
It's shite, isn't it? Go on. Say it.

00:04:36.59,00:04:39.55
- Don't know if I'm...[br]- "It's bull's pizzle, Mr Barrie." Go on, say it.

00:04:39.59,00:04:41.05
- It's bull's pizzle, Mr Barrie.[br]- I knew it.

00:04:41.59,00:04:45.35
- No, I haven't even seen it.[br]- I knew it. Thank you.

00:04:45.35,00:04:47.56
Thank you very much.

00:04:50.10,00:04:53.56
(actor) Might I knock a tune, milord,[br]for a moment?

00:04:55.11,00:04:57.57
(rumble of thunder)

00:04:57.57,00:04:58.86
- I'm an old man...[br]- (snoring)

00:04:59.49,00:05:01.15
...and I've seen few of the sights.

00:05:19.01,00:05:20.97
(man) Absolute rubbish from start to finish.

00:05:21.38,00:05:22.88
(man #2) Yes, I found it fearfully dull.

00:05:22.88,00:05:24.84
(man #3) Say goodbye to your investment,[br]old boy.

00:05:24.89,00:05:27.35
Good to see you. My apologies.

00:05:27.39,00:05:28.89
We'll get them with the next one, Charles,[br]I promise.

00:05:28.89,00:05:32.35
- Of course we will, James.[br]- I know you put a lot into this one.

00:05:32.39,00:05:36.36
A fortune, James, but I am fortunate[br]because I can afford to lose a fortune.

00:05:36.90,00:05:39.03
- Can you?[br]- No, I can't. How are you?

00:05:39.69,00:05:41.65
- Arthur.[br]- James.

00:05:41.69,00:05:43.45
You were sorely missed[br]at the last club meeting.

00:05:43.70,00:05:44.66
Was I?

00:05:44.99,00:05:48.74
We were beginning to wonder[br]which is your hobby, writing or cricket.

00:05:48.74,00:05:50.54
You wanted to speak with Mr Barrie,[br]didn't you?

00:05:50.70,00:05:53.66
Oh, yes, but we shouldn't interrupt them,[br]should we?

00:05:53.71,00:05:55.75
I don't see why not.

00:05:56.00,00:05:59.25
If you ask me, the problem[br]lies in our batting order.

00:05:59.25,00:06:01.05
- James.[br]- Hello, darling.

00:06:01.09,00:06:02.84
You remember Mr and Mrs Snow,[br]don't you?

00:06:03.09,00:06:04.84
- Mrs Snow.[br]- Mr Barrie.

00:06:04.84,00:06:06.05
Mr Snow.

00:06:06.47,00:06:08.93
The Snows have been waiting[br]to meet with you all evening.

00:06:09.10,00:06:11.35
- (Mrs Snow) Oh, yes.[br]- Is that right?

00:06:11.47,00:06:17.15
Your play this evening,[br]it was remarkable, wasn't it?

00:06:17.90,00:06:19.86
Was it?

00:06:20.40,00:06:25.74
Well, thank you. That's very kind of you.[br]I'm glad you liked it.

00:06:27.57,00:06:29.74
How did you feel it went?

00:06:30.70,00:06:32.66
- I think I can do better.[br]- Really?

00:06:36.79,00:06:38.83
(ringing)

00:06:48.80,00:06:52.26
- Mary? Hello?[br]- (distant) Yes, James?

00:06:52.31,00:06:57.14
I'm headed off for the park if you'd[br]like to join me. It's a beautiful morning.

00:06:57.27,00:06:59.65
You'll be working, won't you?

00:07:00.77,00:07:03.03
Perhaps, yes.

00:07:03.28,00:07:06.03
I'll let you to your work then.

00:07:13.58,00:07:16.83
- Morning, Mr Barrie.[br]- Morning, Emma.

00:07:20.08,00:07:21.54
- Have a good day, sir.[br]- And you.

00:07:23.00,00:07:26.55
That's it. Go on, boy. Go get it, boy.

00:07:27.47,00:07:31.43
That's right. Good boy. Grab it. Good.

00:07:59.50,00:08:01.00
(woman laughs)

00:08:01.00,00:08:04.46
Who do you belong to?[br]Come on, boy. Come on.

00:08:08.17,00:08:12.14
Excuse me, sir,[br]you're standing on my sleeve.

00:08:12.14,00:08:14.85
Am I? So sorry.

00:08:16.10,00:08:18.23
I might point out[br]you're lying under my bench.

00:08:18.60,00:08:20.60
I have to, I'm afraid.

00:08:20.60,00:08:25.07
I've been put in a dungeon[br]by the evil Prince George.

00:08:25.07,00:08:27.36
I'm sorry if it bothers you.

00:08:27.90,00:08:31.53
Well, if you're trapped in the dungeon,[br]there isn't much to be done now, is there?

00:08:31.53,00:08:33.45
Perhaps I could slide a key to you[br]through the bars.

00:08:33.70,00:08:39.46
I wouldn't risk it, sir. The evil[br]Prince George has tortured many men.

00:08:39.87,00:08:41.37
I'm sorry. Is he bothering you, sir?

00:08:41.37,00:08:45.75
My brother can be[br]an extremely irritating sort of person.

00:08:45.75,00:08:47.63
Aha, Prince George, I gather.

00:08:48.17,00:08:52.34
I understand you are the horrible tyrant[br]who imprisoned this unfortunate wretch.

00:08:52.34,00:08:56.35
I'm not horrible really, but a firm ruler, yes.[br]Kind and tolerant.

00:08:56.81,00:08:59.85
And what precisely is...[br]What did you say your name was?

00:08:59.98,00:09:02.85
- Michael.[br]- What precisely is Michael's crime?

00:09:02.90,00:09:05.73
- He's my younger brother.[br]- Ah.

00:09:05.98,00:09:11.15
- Fair enough. Sorry, lad. Cannot free you.[br]- That's all right.

00:09:11.15,00:09:13.16
- Do you mind us playing with your dog?[br]- No. Go on.

00:09:13.49,00:09:17.45
This is Jack, second in line to the throne[br]and that one's Michael. He's only five.

00:09:17.79,00:09:20.83
And I'm in prison for it.

00:09:20.87,00:09:25.25
- I'm so sorry. Are my boys bothering you?[br]- (Michael) We're not bothering him, Mum.

00:09:25.38,00:09:27.25
Michael, darling,[br]come out from under there.

00:09:27.25,00:09:29.13
I can't. I'm in prison.

00:09:29.67,00:09:31.76
Oh, I see.

00:09:32.01,00:09:33.97
JM Barrie. Pleased to meet you.

00:09:33.97,00:09:37.56
JM Barrie, the author? A pleasure.[br]Sylvia Llewelyn Davies.

00:09:37.81,00:09:39.35
- (Jack) Are you a writer?[br]- I am.

00:09:39.60,00:09:42.73
He's a playwright, Jack.[br]Quite a famous one, at that.

00:09:42.77,00:09:45.06
- I apologize. I imagine you're writing.[br]- No. Not at all.

00:09:45.19,00:09:48.57
- Where's Peter?[br]- What have you written, Mr Barrie?

00:09:48.69,00:09:55.36
Well, currently, I make my living[br]entertaining princes and their courts

00:09:55.37,00:09:57.83
with my trained bear, Porthos.

00:09:58.20,00:09:59.70
If you command your brother,[br]Peter, to join us,

00:09:59.70,00:10:03.04
I am willing, Prince George,[br]to give you just such a performance

00:10:03.71,00:10:06.46
in exchange for the freedom[br]of this prisoner, of course.

00:10:06.46,00:10:08.04
- V ery well.[br]- V ery well.

00:10:09.09,00:10:10.59
Now...

00:10:10.59,00:10:14.93
I want you to pay particular attention[br]to the teeth.

00:10:15.09,00:10:17.80
(Porthos whines)

00:10:17.80,00:10:22.56
Some unscrupulous trainers will show you[br]a bear whose teeth have all been pulled,

00:10:22.77,00:10:27.15
while other cowards[br]will force the brute into a muzzle.

00:10:27.27,00:10:33.44
Only the true master would attempt these[br]tricks without either measure of safety.

00:10:35.57,00:10:38.95
- What did you bring me over here for?[br]- (whispers) Peter.

00:10:38.99,00:10:41.83
This is absurd. It's just a dog.

00:10:43.79,00:10:46.33
Come on, darling.

00:10:46.71,00:10:50.63
- "Just a dog"? "Just"?[br]- (Porthos whines)

00:10:50.63,00:10:52.76
Porthos, don't listen to him.

00:10:53.01,00:10:54.76
Porthos dreams of being a bear

00:10:54.80,00:10:59.55
and you want to dash those dreams[br]by saying he's "just a dog"? (tuts)

00:10:59.55,00:11:01.64
What a horrible, candle-snuffing word.

00:11:01.81,00:11:05.94
That's like saying, "He can't climb[br]that mountain, he's just a man."

00:11:06.27,00:11:10.65
Or, "That's not a diamond, it's just a rock."

00:11:12.07,00:11:14.15
"Just."

00:11:16.07,00:11:21.24
Fine then. Turn him into a bear. If you can.

00:11:21.58,00:11:23.08
Peter, where are your manners?

00:11:23.08,00:11:27.96
With those eyes, my bonny lad,[br]I'm afraid you'd never see it.

00:11:28.50,00:11:33.75
However, with just a wee bit of imagination,

00:11:33.88,00:11:37.93
I can turn around right now and see...

00:11:37.93,00:11:40.05
the great bear, Porthos.

00:11:41.39,00:11:43.64
Dance with me.

00:11:43.97,00:11:46.43
(laughter)

00:11:50.10,00:11:53.15
(bear snarls)

00:11:53.98,00:11:56.03
(applause)

00:12:13.09,00:12:15.76
(crowd gasps and laughs)

00:12:45.28,00:12:49.16
Thank you. I don't think I've ever seen[br]a performance quite like it.

00:12:49.29,00:12:53.33
We're here every day, and the bear[br]is always more than happy to perform.

00:12:53.50,00:12:55.54
(Sylvia) Well, perhaps we'll see you here[br]tomorrow then.

00:12:55.59,00:12:57.84
Perhaps.

00:12:58.09,00:13:00.84
- Peter, jump up please, darling. Quick.[br]- (children) Bye.

00:13:00.97,00:13:03.26
Bye.

00:13:03.30,00:13:06.76
- Peter, didn't you enjoy that?[br]- I've seen better.

00:13:06.81,00:13:09.73
Well, Michael wanted the bear[br]kept prisoner with him,

00:13:09.77,00:13:12.85
and Peter insisted[br]that Michael was hardly a prisoner

00:13:13.10,00:13:15.94
and Porthos simply wasn't a bear at all.

00:13:17.57,00:13:20.15
I do very much hope to see them tomorrow.

00:13:20.28,00:13:23.74
- What's her name?[br]- Sylvia. Um...

00:13:23.78,00:13:27.66
Mrs... something Davies.

00:13:28.79,00:13:30.96
Llewelyn Davies?

00:13:31.29,00:13:35.33
- You know her?[br]- I know who she is, of course.

00:13:35.58,00:13:38.09
Why, she's a du Maurier,[br]for heaven's sake.

00:13:38.09,00:13:44.34
Her father was the artist.[br]Her brother's the actor.

00:13:44.59,00:13:49.43
And there was something... tragic[br]that happened with her husband.

00:13:49.68,00:13:52.56
Oh, yes. He died.

00:13:52.77,00:13:56.15
Cancer of the jaw, I believe.

00:13:56.15,00:13:57.73
That's horrible.

00:13:58.27,00:14:04.24
Yes. Apparently, he left her with four boys[br]and no income to speak of.

00:14:05.28,00:14:08.53
If it wasn't for her mother's help...

00:14:12.29,00:14:15.04
James.

00:14:15.29,00:14:20.46
- We should have them to dinner.[br]- Should we?

00:14:20.80,00:14:25.11
Absolutely. I've always wanted[br]to meet Madam du Maurier.

00:14:25.11,00:14:29.43
Why, she knows practically[br]everyone there is worth knowing.

00:14:42.28,00:14:46.36
- What are you writing about?[br]- Oh.

00:14:46.78,00:14:49.03
Nothing of any great consequence.

00:14:50.28,00:14:52.83
I can't write.

00:14:53.29,00:14:55.83
Have you ever kept a journal?

00:14:56.79,00:14:59.84
Ever tried your hand at writing a play?

00:15:00.80,00:15:02.96
Well, then how do you know?

00:15:03.80,00:15:07.13
I know. That's all.

00:15:07.30,00:15:11.64
I see. Where's your mother today[br]and the rest of the boys?

00:15:11.81,00:15:15.64
Home. Mother's got a bit of a chest cold.

00:15:17.19,00:15:22.23
I'm sure everyone would be happy[br]to see you though. One afternoon.

00:15:24.90,00:15:27.15
I should leave you to your writing.

00:15:31.20,00:15:33.70
Peter.

00:15:33.70,00:15:35.96
I'll see you later then.

00:15:45.59,00:15:49.11
Why didn't you tell me, Charles?[br]You knew it wasn't any good.

00:15:49.11,00:15:52.64
Why didn't you tell me, James?[br]You knew it wasn't any good. Hm?

00:15:52.68,00:15:57.35
I took an extended lease on the theater,[br]keeping the actors on.

00:15:57.69,00:16:01.56
- I don't have another play.[br]- I'm sure you will.

00:16:04.19,00:16:06.36
- Won't you?[br]- We'll see.

00:16:06.69,00:16:09.36
I need you to sign for the storage,[br]Mr Frohman.

00:16:10.20,00:16:14.24
- (man) Lower.[br]- (man #2) Easy does it. Take your time.

00:16:19.71,00:16:23.46
It was never meant to be taken seriously.

00:16:23.67,00:16:27.26
You know what happened, James?[br]They changed it.

00:16:28.17,00:16:32.14
- They changed what?[br]- The critics.

00:16:33.30,00:16:36.35
They made it important.

00:16:41.27,00:16:42.65
Hm?

00:16:42.77,00:16:44.86
What's it called?

00:16:47.28,00:16:49.97
What's it called?

00:16:49.97,00:16:52.66
- "Play."[br]- "Play."

00:17:03.79,00:17:04.58
(whip crack)

00:17:04.59,00:17:06.75
(boys) Bang, bang, bang!

00:17:07.17,00:17:08.84
Bang!

00:17:10.80,00:17:13.14
Return the boy to us, you nasty Injun.

00:17:13.18,00:17:16.43
Our people teach boy Indian ways,[br]make him great warrior.

00:17:16.89,00:17:20.64
Our chief, Running Nose, never let him go.

00:17:20.89,00:17:22.94
Bang, bang, bang!

00:17:25.48,00:17:28.86
Me wounded, Peter. Time's short.

00:17:28.99,00:17:33.32
You go. Spread wings[br]and soar like eagle above enemy.

00:17:33.32,00:17:37.66
Fly back to our chief.[br]Tell her of my brave defeat.

00:17:37.99,00:17:40.33
That's crazy. Indians can't fly.

00:17:40.50,00:17:42.50
Of course they can. Go on, go on, go on.

00:17:42.50,00:17:45.04
Listen to us, boy.[br]This Injun kidnapped you.

00:17:45.50,00:17:49.59
Not true. We kidnap no one. You lost boy.

00:17:49.59,00:17:54.34
I teach you ways of the brave.[br]I take you as my own son.

00:17:54.80,00:17:57.14
You are not my father.

00:17:59.10,00:18:01.14
(boys) Bang, bang, bang, bang!

00:18:01.18,00:18:02.94
- I've got him![br]- Let me go!

00:18:03.10,00:18:05.44
- (George) Stop it, you two.[br]- Ooh, we are awful, aren't we?

00:18:05.44,00:18:07.57
- I'm warning you.[br]- Oh, I'm scared.

00:18:07.77,00:18:09.44
Of course, you had a bit of fun[br]for a change.

00:18:09.78,00:18:12.36
- (George) Stop it, you two. Get off![br]- (Peter) Don't.

00:18:12.36,00:18:14.36
- Jack![br]- (George) Stop it!

00:18:14.41,00:18:17.45
- (Jack) Get off, George![br]- (Sylvia) Peter.

00:18:20.08,00:18:23.83
- I'm terribly sorry.[br]- No, it wasn't your fault.

00:18:24.00,00:18:25.75
I'm afraid it might have been.

00:18:26.00,00:18:29.84
To be honest, I'm just happy you got him[br]to join in the game.

00:18:30.00,00:18:32.47
Oh, yes, I was a tremendous success.

00:18:32.51,00:18:36.26
Mr Barrie, it's more[br]than I've been able to achieve.

00:18:36.47,00:18:40.26
Peter's a different boy since his father died.

00:18:40.47,00:18:44.27
You know, I don't think[br]he's even had a good cry about it.

00:18:44.27,00:18:48.06
Well, grief affects us all in different ways,[br]doesn't it?

00:18:48.07,00:18:49.57
Yes, it does.

00:18:49.98,00:18:56.16
Oh, by the way, my wife would like[br]to invite you and the boys over to dinner.

00:18:56.28,00:18:59.33
Your mother as well.

00:18:59.37,00:19:01.24
Oh.

00:19:01.37,00:19:05.16
How kind. That would be lovely.

00:19:07.79,00:19:08.96
Well...

00:19:09.17,00:19:12.17
Don't you all look lovely in your little suits?

00:19:12.17,00:19:17.93
And, Mrs du Maurier, what a shame it is[br]that we've not met until this evening.

00:19:18.59,00:19:20.10
How kind of you to say so.

00:19:20.10,00:19:24.56
Not at all. I can't tell you how many times[br]I've been to a charity or a social event

00:19:24.60,00:19:28.35
and seen your name listed[br]among the organizers.

00:19:30.61,00:19:35.44
It's the very thing I would love to do myself

00:19:35.70,00:19:38.78
- if I could just find the time.[br]- (boys snigger)

00:19:38.78,00:19:42.66
My problem is in finding the time[br]to do everything else.

00:19:42.79,00:19:45.79
At the moment I am running[br]two households.

00:19:45.79,00:19:48.17
Sylvia believes she can get by[br]without a housekeeper.

00:19:48.21,00:19:49.33
Mother.

00:19:49.50,00:19:51.25
My house is quite large enough for us all,

00:19:51.38,00:19:55.55
- but the idea of living with me seems...[br]- Not now, please, mother.

00:19:56.01,00:19:58.84
- We help her keep the house in order.[br]- Don't interrupt, George.

00:19:58.84,00:20:02.47
- Where did you get your manners?[br]- Sorry, Grandmother.

00:20:02.47,00:20:07.94
Mr Barrie, I understand you've become[br]playmates of my grandchildren.

00:20:08.19,00:20:13.07
- Oh, they indulge me, really.[br]- On the contrary.

00:20:13.19,00:20:18.24
The other day we took to an exploration[br]of darkest Africa in our garden.

00:20:18.57,00:20:23.83
But Mr Barrie was taken ill[br]by the bite of a... What was it?

00:20:23.83,00:20:26.33
Tsetse fly. Quite horrible.

00:20:26.58,00:20:29.04
Yes, and he swelled to the size[br]of a hippopotamus.

00:20:29.08,00:20:30.46
Fingers like sausages.

00:20:30.58,00:20:33.96
And we had to float in him down the river[br]like he was a great bloated raft.

00:20:34.59,00:20:37.84
(Jack) But the fishing was good, wasn't it?

00:20:41.59,00:20:43.43
James.

00:20:45.97,00:20:48.23
- Please.[br]- (boys snigger and laugh)

00:20:48.27,00:20:51.06
- (James) Bye.[br]- (Mrs du Maurier) Thank you so much.

00:20:51.10,00:20:52.73
- (Mary) Lovely evening.[br]- (Peter) Thank you. Bye.

00:20:53.11,00:20:56.53
- (Mary) Good night.[br]- (George) Good night.

00:21:00.07,00:21:03.53
Well, that was a disaster.

00:21:04.08,00:21:08.95
(Mrs du Maurier) Painful.[br]Utterly painful to see.

00:21:09.58,00:21:11.83
I don't know what you mean.[br]I had a lovely time.

00:21:12.00,00:21:14.08
Oh, James, please.

00:21:14.09,00:21:18.46
"My problem is in finding[br]the time to do everything else."

00:21:18.59,00:21:23.14
- I never felt so judged in my life.[br]- Judged? How do you mean?

00:21:23.14,00:21:25.43
(Mrs du Maurier) A grown man,[br]for heaven's sake,

00:21:25.60,00:21:28.35
playing all day long with children?

00:21:28.77,00:21:33.15
In any case, I hardly think they'll be[br]the social contact we'd hoped for.

00:21:33.15,00:21:37.53
I hadn't really thought of them that way.[br]I just enjoy their company.

00:21:37.90,00:21:41.03
He's been a good friend to us, Mother.

00:21:41.03,00:21:44.87
Yes. But what does that mean? Hm?

00:21:44.91,00:21:45.83
Surely you don't intend...

00:21:46.37,00:21:51.33
...to keep spending your afternoons[br]with those children, do you?

00:21:55.38,00:21:56.96
And so today, ladies and gentlemen,

00:21:58.59,00:22:01.05
using only the wind[br]and his own physical strength,

00:22:01.17,00:22:04.64
George Llewelyn Davies shall test[br]the very limits of the atmosphere

00:22:04.68,00:22:07.10
using his tethered craft. Go on, boy.

00:22:07.10,00:22:09.77
- (Jack) Go on, George.[br]- (Peter) You're going to break it, George.

00:22:09.97,00:22:12.06
- George, stop![br]- I just need a bit more speed.

00:22:12.10,00:22:13.85
(Michael) I want to do it.

00:22:14.19,00:22:16.86
Hold off a bit, George.[br]I think it's in need of a tail.

00:22:16.86,00:22:18.73
(Sylvia) Oh, wait.

00:22:20.40,00:22:22.40
- Here. James, this will do.[br]- That's a good idea.

00:22:22.40,00:22:24.53
- (George) No, it's not heavy enough.[br]- (Michael) I want to do it.

00:22:24.78,00:22:28.53
- You coming, Peter?[br]- (James whistles) Porthos!

00:22:28.70,00:22:30.75
Lt'll work this time.

00:22:30.79,00:22:33.75
Porthos, give us your bell. That's good.

00:22:33.79,00:22:34.87
- Michael?[br]- Yeah?

00:22:34.87,00:22:38.34
- Now, would you like to give it a go?[br]- Yes, please.

00:22:38.50,00:22:41.84
- (Jack) Oh, he can't run fast enough.[br]- Of course he can.

00:22:42.30,00:22:44.76
- Let him try, Jack.[br]- (James) Now, George, you hold the kite.

00:22:44.80,00:22:45.80
George.

00:22:45.80,00:22:49.64
Come on, boys, let's go back up to the top.[br]Come on, Peter.

00:22:50.10,00:22:55.06
Right, George, hold it up. Darling,[br]you've got to run now. Ready? Ready?

00:22:55.19,00:22:58.06
- Run! Run, Michael![br]- Run!

00:22:58.69,00:23:02.74
- Oh, I told you this wasn't going to work.[br]- I don't think he's fast enough.

00:23:02.90,00:23:04.74
It's not going to work[br]if no one believes in him.

00:23:04.90,00:23:07.24
- Now, give him a chance.[br]- Michael, go back to your starting position.

00:23:07.24,00:23:09.66
- Come on, darling, try again.[br]- George, you take the kite.

00:23:09.78,00:23:15.83
Now this time, I don't want a flea's breath[br]of doubt. We must get that kite in the air.

00:23:16.29,00:23:19.13
(Sylvia) Right. Look, I think I feel a bit[br]more breeze. Are you ready, Michael?

00:23:19.17,00:23:22.13
- You can do it, Michael.[br]- You've got to run. Run, Michael, run.

00:23:22.13,00:23:24.05
- (all) Run![br]- (James) That's it!

00:23:24.59,00:23:28.09
(George) Yes! He did it!

00:23:28.09,00:23:31.35
(Jack) Keep running! Keep running!

00:23:34.27,00:23:36.35
(bells tinkles)

00:24:01.00,00:24:03.34
What are you writing about now?

00:24:03.50,00:24:05.63
Oh, just making notes.

00:24:05.80,00:24:10.14
I'm never really certain what they're about[br]until I've read them over later.

00:24:10.80,00:24:12.93
Something about the kite?

00:24:15.60,00:24:18.14
Now, why do you ask that?

00:24:19.90,00:24:21.73
I don't know.

00:24:21.90,00:24:26.74
If I were a writer I think I could tell[br]a whole story about flying the kite today.

00:24:26.90,00:24:31.62
Perhaps you should then. That's[br]a fantastic idea. Why not give it a try?

00:24:31.62,00:24:36.33
I hope you haven't been talking about[br]anything too serious with this one.

00:24:36.70,00:24:40.62
No. Talking a bit of silliness really.

00:24:49.38,00:24:51.34
Can we have him for supper?

00:24:51.39,00:24:53.76
Have him to stay for supper, Michael.[br]We're not cannibals.

00:24:53.89,00:24:55.26
You are welcome, you know.

00:24:55.39,00:24:57.85
(laughter)

00:24:57.89,00:25:00.42
Sylvia. Mr Barrie.

00:25:00.42,00:25:02.94
Where have you been?

00:25:03.19,00:25:04.86
Flying a kite, Mother,[br]and having a wonderful time.

00:25:05.19,00:25:06.94
I'm sorry. I didn't know[br]you were coming this evening.

00:25:07.19,00:25:10.20
No? Well, apparently you forgot then.

00:25:10.20,00:25:13.24
- I brought some supper along for us all.[br]- You didn't need to do that.

00:25:13.41,00:25:15.83
Well, there's no food in the house, is there?

00:25:15.87,00:25:18.04
Really. You don't need to wait[br]till the cupboard is bare.

00:25:18.29,00:25:20.00
Please, Mother. Come on, darlings.

00:25:20.00,00:25:23.13
Wipe feet. There's been[br]enough tracking round here.

00:25:23.50,00:25:26.63
George, I thought you said you were going[br]to help your mother take care of the house.

00:25:26.63,00:25:28.84
Coat, Michael, please. Yes.

00:25:29.30,00:25:33.55
- And... coat hanger. Good.[br]- (Michael) Will we see you tomorrow?

00:25:33.55,00:25:36.64
No. You're going to be helping[br]round the house tomorrow.

00:25:36.89,00:25:39.43
Mother, there is absolutely no need for this.

00:25:39.77,00:25:42.14
You can't do everything yourself.

00:25:42.40,00:25:47.53
Look at you. You're horribly flush.[br]You're wearing yourself out.

00:25:47.53,00:25:50.95
Thank you for a lovely day, James.[br]Excuse me, Mother.

00:25:51.20,00:25:57.03
So from tomorrow, we're going to have[br]some discipline around here.

00:25:57.04,00:26:01.66
And not one of you will escape.

00:26:06.67,00:26:08.46
- Good evening, Mr Barrie.[br]- Good evening, Sarah.

00:26:08.50,00:26:12.63
- Good evening, Mr Barrie.[br]- Good evening, Emma.

00:26:20.77,00:26:22.73
You missed supper.

00:26:24.19,00:26:27.57
Perhaps I'll have something later.[br]I have a bit of writing I wanted to do.

00:26:27.57,00:26:31.65
Are you sure? It was a lovely meal. Duck.

00:26:31.99,00:26:35.74
Sarah let Emma cook this evening.

00:26:35.91,00:26:40.16
Is that right? Listen, what would you think[br]of loaning Emma out to the Davies

00:26:40.37,00:26:41.83
for the occasional evening?

00:26:41.87,00:26:44.25
They don't actually have a cook.

00:26:45.21,00:26:48.54
I take it Mrs Davies enjoyed the meal[br]that she had here?

00:26:51.59,00:26:55.13
I imagine she could use an extra hand[br]now and again. That's all.

00:26:55.14,00:26:57.85
That's very charitable of you.

00:26:58.97,00:27:02.06
Perhaps we can send over[br]some of the silver as well.

00:27:02.48,00:27:04.48
And what about linen?

00:27:04.48,00:27:07.44
I wouldn't be surprised if some of hers[br]was looking a bit shabby.

00:27:07.44,00:27:09.73
Please, Mary, stop.

00:27:10.90,00:27:14.95
Maybe she can send over[br]some of the things we've run short on.

00:27:14.95,00:27:17.66
My husband, for example.

00:27:18.57,00:27:21.74
We rarely see him in this house.

00:27:22.08,00:27:24.75
That hasn't seemed to bother you[br]for some time now.

00:27:25.00,00:27:27.46
(clatter)

00:27:28.79,00:27:30.63
(rumble of thunder)

00:28:04.70,00:28:07.54
(carriage draws up, horses whinny)

00:28:10.00,00:28:15.76
(James) Lords and ladies, His Royal[br]Highness, King Michael the Benevolent,

00:28:15.80,00:28:18.30
protector of the realm.

00:28:18.30,00:28:21.14
(Peter) That scepter's made of wood.

00:28:21.30,00:28:24.27
Yes, well, we dream on a budget here,[br]don't we?

00:28:24.81,00:28:29.85
No, I mean, everyone thinks it's made[br]of gold, but it's just an old hunk of wood.

00:28:29.86,00:28:32.15
The means to an end, Peter.

00:28:32.69,00:28:36.15
What we've done is taken[br]an old hunk of wood

00:28:36.19,00:28:40.45
and transformed it for all the world to see[br]into the most magnificent gold.

00:28:41.57,00:28:45.16
- There you go.[br]- What's this?

00:28:45.20,00:28:50.75
All great writers begin with a good[br]leather binding and a respectable title.

00:28:51.29,00:28:53.54
Open it.

00:28:56.59,00:28:58.55
"The Boy Castaways."

00:28:58.59,00:29:03.14
"Being a record of the terrible adventures[br]of the brothers Davies,

00:29:03.60,00:29:08.10
faithfully set forth by...[br]Peter Llewelyn Davies."

00:29:08.10,00:29:11.06
Kipling would swallow his own ear[br]for a title like that.

00:29:11.19,00:29:14.15
Stab him, George. You can do it.

00:29:14.69,00:29:17.23
I still have no idea what to write.

00:29:17.57,00:29:20.03
Write about anything.[br]Write about your family.

00:29:20.28,00:29:23.03
- Write about the talking whale.[br]- What whale?

00:29:23.20,00:29:29.16
The one that's trapped in your imagination[br]and desperate to get out. Come sit down.

00:29:32.38,00:29:36.34
I have actually begun writing about the[br]adventures of the Davies brothers myself.

00:29:36.38,00:29:39.63
- A play?[br]- A play indeed, yes.

00:29:39.88,00:29:42.34
And I would be extremely honored

00:29:42.39,00:29:46.85
if you would allow me the use of your name[br]for one of the characters.

00:29:46.89,00:29:49.64
I don't know what to say.

00:29:49.64,00:29:51.44
Say yes.

00:29:53.40,00:29:54.40
Good man.

00:29:54.40,00:29:56.44
Porthos! That's mine. Let go.

00:29:56.77,00:29:59.57
(Michael) I won't go to bed. I won't, I won't.

00:29:59.57,00:30:04.45
You should have been in bed[br]half an hour ago, young man.

00:30:05.20,00:30:07.74
I'm afraid I've grown hopelessly lax[br]in my discipline.

00:30:07.74,00:30:11.04
Nonsense. Young boys[br]should never be sent to bed.

00:30:11.21,00:30:14.25
They always wake up a day older.

00:30:14.50,00:30:18.46
And then, before you know it,[br]they're grown.

00:30:18.50,00:30:20.51
Their father would have been horrified.

00:30:20.51,00:30:22.63
Of course, he never would have allowed[br]a dog in the house either.

00:30:22.97,00:30:25.55
He'd have tied him up in the yard.

00:30:25.59,00:30:29.43
Right! Last one in bed's a hairy toad.

00:31:19.48,00:31:22.53
You mean a lot to my boys, you know.

00:31:24.07,00:31:26.86
Especially Peter.

00:31:27.57,00:31:31.66
It seems to me[br]that Peter's trying to grow up too fast.

00:31:33.58,00:31:39.25
I imagine he thinks that grown-ups don't[br]hurt as deeply as children do when they...

00:31:39.25,00:31:41.63
when they lose someone.

00:31:44.59,00:31:49.43
I lost my elder brother, David,[br]when I was just Peter's age.

00:31:49.60,00:31:52.56
And it nearly destroyed my mother.

00:31:53.10,00:31:56.06
James, I'm so sorry.

00:31:57.10,00:32:00.94
Your poor mother.[br]I can't imagine losing a child.

00:32:01.11,00:32:03.03
Aye.

00:32:04.07,00:32:06.45
She didn't get out of bed for months.

00:32:06.78,00:32:09.16
She wouldn't eat.

00:32:09.41,00:32:12.54
I tried everything to make her happy, but...

00:32:13.87,00:32:16.25
she only wanted David.

00:32:16.37,00:32:17.96
So...

00:32:18.08,00:32:20.13
one day...

00:32:21.17,00:32:24.26
I dressed myself in David's clothing

00:32:26.67,00:32:29.09
and I went to her.

00:32:29.09,00:32:32.26
You must have frightened her to death.

00:32:32.47,00:32:38.23
I think it was the first time[br]she ever actually... looked at me.

00:32:42.90,00:32:45.94
And that was the end of the boy James.

00:32:48.40,00:32:51.24
I used to say to myself[br]he'd gone to Neverland.

00:32:51.28,00:32:53.33
Where?

00:32:53.37,00:32:56.95
Neverland. It's a wonderful place.

00:33:06.88,00:33:10.26
I've not spoken about this before[br]to anyone.

00:33:10.89,00:33:12.76
Ever.

00:33:22.69,00:33:26.65
What's it like... Neverland?

00:33:29.40,00:33:32.24
One day I'll take you there.

00:33:33.78,00:33:35.45
(Charles) Wait a minute, James.[br]He's a fairy?

00:33:35.79,00:33:39.46
Er, no. He's the irrepressible[br]spirit of youth. Tinker Bell is the fairy.

00:33:39.46,00:33:42.54
- Tinker Bell is a woman?[br]- She's not a woman. She's a fairy.

00:33:42.79,00:33:45.75
He is a boy who stays young forever.

00:33:45.80,00:33:48.13
James, how does anyone[br]stay young forever? It doesn't work.

00:33:48.30,00:33:50.93
He just believes, Charles.[br]He imagines life the way he wants it to be,

00:33:51.30,00:33:56.43
and he believes in it long enough and hard[br]enough that it all appears before him, see?

00:33:56.43,00:33:58.93
James, I'm your friend.[br]You're coming off a flop.

00:33:59.27,00:34:03.56
- You have a man who is a fairy.[br]- No, a boy who has a fairy.

00:34:03.56,00:34:05.23
And this girl calls herself Tinker.

00:34:05.48,00:34:09.44
And you have a pirate ship on stage[br]surrounded by tons and tons of water.

00:34:09.49,00:34:11.49
- That's a lot of water.[br]- It's a lot of water.

00:34:11.49,00:34:15.24
- Yes, and that's a lot of money.[br]- It is, but we can fake the water.

00:34:15.49,00:34:18.24
Oh, well, if we can fake the water[br]then I'm sure your play will be a hit.

00:34:18.49,00:34:21.83
You know what I think I'll do? I think[br]I'll imagine life the way I want it to be...

00:34:22.00,00:34:22.83
Long enough and hard enough?

00:34:23.00,00:34:27.34
Yes, and then the money for the play[br]will appear magically before me.

00:34:27.50,00:34:29.26
- That's right. That's it.[br]- Yes.

00:34:29.51,00:34:32.34
How does the clock wind up[br]inside the crocodile?

00:34:32.47,00:34:34.64
- He swallows it.[br]- Ah, of course he does.

00:34:36.80,00:34:38.26
(men) Out!

00:34:40.60,00:34:42.10
How was he?

00:34:42.10,00:34:43.94
- Well done.[br]- (woman) Good show!

00:34:46.11,00:34:48.23
I finally get the courage[br]to invite the boys to a game

00:34:48.23,00:34:51.24
and we have to suffer[br]this grave humiliation.

00:34:51.49,00:34:53.19
It's perfect actually.

00:34:53.20,00:34:55.45
Spend a good deal of time with them,[br]don't you?

00:34:55.70,00:34:57.95
Every moment I can spare, in fact.

00:34:58.20,00:35:00.33
I'm glad for you.

00:35:00.70,00:35:04.25
And Mrs Davies seems to be[br]having a good time of it as well.

00:35:04.29,00:35:08.84
You should be aware though, James,[br]what some people have been saying.

00:35:09.30,00:35:13.05
Mind you, I wouldn't bring it up[br]if I thought the rumors would pass.

00:35:13.30,00:35:16.05
I'm not surprised. What are they saying?

00:35:17.80,00:35:19.30
V ery well.

00:35:19.31,00:35:22.73
That you spend much more time with Mrs[br]Davies than you do with your own wife.

00:35:22.77,00:35:25.44
She's a widow. And...

00:35:25.90,00:35:29.15
And a friend. That's it. Nothing more.

00:35:29.90,00:35:35.15
There have also been questions about[br]how you spend your time with those boys.

00:35:35.40,00:35:37.45
And why.

00:35:38.28,00:35:42.54
That's outrageous. How could anyone[br]think something so evil?

00:35:42.79,00:35:47.25
They're children.[br]They're innocent children.

00:35:48.50,00:35:50.54
You find a glimmer of happiness[br]in this world,

00:35:50.59,00:35:52.96
there's always someone[br]who wants to destroy it.

00:35:53.09,00:35:59.43
No. Thank you, Arthur, but I don't think[br]many will give credence to such nonsense.

00:35:59.60,00:36:02.06
Then why is no one sitting with them?

00:36:03.39,00:36:06.06
Once you get a bit of notoriety, James,

00:36:06.48,00:36:12.36
people watch you and they will[br]look for ways to drag you down.

00:36:15.99,00:36:18.74
(Sylvia) Are you sure your wife doesn't[br]object to us taking over your cottage

00:36:18.74,00:36:19.87
for the summer, James?

00:36:20.07,00:36:22.33
- She doesn't go there anymore.[br]- Really?

00:36:22.49,00:36:25.25
It's such a relief to get away.[br]You'll come and visit, I hope?

00:36:25.50,00:36:28.25
- Of course. Are we in?[br]- Everyone in?

00:36:28.50,00:36:31.34
- Can I drive, Uncle Jim?[br]- Er, no.

00:36:31.50,00:36:32.46
(laughter)

00:36:34.59,00:36:37.05
(horn)

00:36:46.60,00:36:48.56
Out of the way[br]or I'll make haggis out of you.

00:36:49.10,00:36:51.15
(Michael) Get the sheep out the way.

00:36:51.77,00:36:54.15
(horn)

00:37:08.50,00:37:12.13
- (Peter) Are we there yet?[br]- (James) Almost. Almost there.

00:37:12.50,00:37:15.46
(George) I can see the cottage!

00:37:33.27,00:37:36.23
- (Jack) Shall we explore, Michael?[br]- Don't tear your clothes, please.

00:37:36.28,00:37:39.24
- Come on. Follow me.[br]- (Sylvia) Be careful of stinging nettles.

00:37:39.28,00:37:40.24
(Jack) Hurry up, everyone.

00:37:46.29,00:37:49.96
- Would you like to see the rest of it?[br]- Mm. Yes.

00:38:11.89,00:38:13.40
'Ello!

00:38:13.40,00:38:16.36
Thought you could escape[br]from Captain Swarthy, eh?

00:38:16.40,00:38:20.44
Off to the ship with you, then.[br]Off to the ship, son!

00:38:22.91,00:38:27.03
So now you can either choose[br]to become a pirate with the rest of us,

00:38:27.37,00:38:30.04
or we'll toss you to the sharks.

00:38:30.58,00:38:35.46
- (Michael) How marvelous.[br]- Well, maybe the crocodiles, eh?

00:38:35.58,00:38:38.96
- No one's escaped, Captain.[br]- Excellent work, matey.

00:38:39.09,00:38:39.96
Now then.

00:38:40.09,00:38:43.43
Now is your only chance to speak.

00:38:43.59,00:38:46.93
Who amongst you is ready[br]to tie your hopes and dreams to the sea?

00:38:47.10,00:38:49.35
- I am![br]- Not finished yet.

00:38:49.39,00:38:52.73
To enter upon[br]the most dangerous chapter

00:38:52.89,00:38:56.23
in your young[br]and soon-to-be-wasted lives?

00:38:56.27,00:38:57.36
(giggling)

00:38:57.61,00:38:59.53
What did you say? What are doing, son?

00:38:59.57,00:39:02.74
Are you giggling? On my ship?[br]Giggling? What did you say?

00:39:03.07,00:39:05.24
- I said I'm ready, Captain.[br]- What's your name, boy?

00:39:05.57,00:39:08.45
I'm Curly, the oldest and wisest of the crew.

00:39:08.58,00:39:10.83
Cut him loose, matey.

00:39:11.08,00:39:15.25
Welcome aboard, Curly.[br]Your job will be to mop the deck.

00:39:16.08,00:39:18.34
And who be you, young squire?

00:39:18.59,00:39:23.92
My name be Nibs the Cut-throat. Feared[br]by men and greatly desired by the ladies.

00:39:23.97,00:39:24.84
Jack!

00:39:25.18,00:39:29.26
Welcome aboard, Nibs.[br]You shall polish all wood surfaces.

00:39:29.26,00:39:31.56
Grab a hold of that rigging.

00:39:31.89,00:39:35.06
- And you, lad?[br]- I'm Peter.

00:39:35.48,00:39:39.86
That's not a pirate name.[br]What about Dastardly Jim, eh?

00:39:39.98,00:39:42.42
No. Just Peter.

00:39:42.42,00:39:44.86
I like my name.

00:39:45.99,00:39:48.24
V ery well.

00:39:48.49,00:39:54.16
In punishment for lack of an interesting[br]pirate name, Peter shall walk the plank.

00:39:54.16,00:39:56.33
Cut him loose.

00:40:18.48,00:40:21.36
- What are you playing again?[br]- The boy.

00:40:21.48,00:40:22.86
What have you got...? Excuse me.

00:40:23.48,00:40:26.36
Mr Barrie, sir?

00:40:26.49,00:40:29.66
There's been a mistake here, sir.[br]It says here I'm to play the nanny.

00:40:29.99,00:40:35.16
- I don't imagine I quite fit that part, eh?[br]- You're not actually the nanny.

00:40:35.16,00:40:37.04
You're a dog.

00:40:37.50,00:40:39.50
- What?[br]- A Newfoundland.

00:40:39.50,00:40:41.84
We'll put you in a great big fluffy dog suit.

00:40:42.00,00:40:44.46
Rrr.

00:40:45.51,00:40:47.63
Oh, right.

00:40:49.47,00:40:53.06
Actually, we don't have a Tinker Bell cast,[br]do we? He could play Tinker Bell.

00:40:53.60,00:40:57.44
Heavens, no. Tinker Bell's a light.[br]It moves around the stage.

00:40:57.44,00:41:00.06
Just a wee light[br]that moves around the stage.

00:41:02.98,00:41:05.03
Bit worried about this.

00:41:05.48,00:41:09.03
(Charles, under his breath) Let's see.[br]We've got John Darling, Michael Darling,

00:41:09.03,00:41:12.03
Tiger Lily, Smee, Skylights.

00:41:12.49,00:41:16.54
It's a play for puppets.[br]Tootles, Nibs, Curly.

00:41:17.00,00:41:19.54
All these names are absurd[br]when you see them all together.

00:41:19.54,00:41:21.63
Captain Hook, S...

00:41:22.50,00:41:25.55
(under his breath) Oh, hello, James.

00:41:27.01,00:41:28.47
You're out of your mind.

00:41:28.51,00:41:31.26
(door opens and closes)

00:41:40.98,00:41:43.23
How were rehearsals?

00:41:43.48,00:41:48.94
Fine. Great. They're going... quite well.

00:41:48.99,00:41:52.37
- Good.[br]- Yes. Thank you.

00:42:18.31,00:42:20.73
(coughs)

00:42:21.77,00:42:24.36
(car approaches)

00:42:30.49,00:42:33.86
- Hello.[br]- Hello.

00:42:34.49,00:42:38.74
- How was your journey?[br]- It was quite long. I'm exhausted.

00:42:39.08,00:42:42.96
- Let's get you some tea.[br]- That'd be nice. Thanks.

00:42:44.08,00:42:49.00
- Can you come to the playhouse?[br]- In a moment, Michael. He's just arrived.

00:42:49.01,00:42:53.93
But I said I'd get him. They always[br]send Peter to do things. I said I'll do it.

00:42:54.30,00:42:58.31
- It will spoil the surprise.[br]- What surprise, darling?

00:42:58.31,00:43:02.94
It's a great surprise. We've taken[br]most of the day preparing for it.

00:43:03.39,00:43:07.48
- Everybody's waiting for you.[br]- Then we mustn't keep them waiting.

00:43:07.48,00:43:11.86
(gasps) Please don't tell them[br]that I told you the surprise. I said I wouldn't.

00:43:11.99,00:43:13.86
Oh, well, you didn't really tell us[br]anything about it, did you?

00:43:13.86,00:43:17.74
- Yes I did. It's a play.[br]- It's a play?

00:43:19.29,00:43:21.33
(medieval music)

00:43:29.80,00:43:32.63
(Peter) "The Lamentable Tale[br]of Lady Ursula."

00:43:32.80,00:43:35.93
"A play in one act[br]by Peter Llewelyn Davies."

00:43:38.68,00:43:42.85
- This is just a bit of silliness, really.[br]- I should hope so. Go on.

00:43:42.98,00:43:45.44
I just wanted to take a stab at writing,[br]you know.

00:43:45.69,00:43:48.15
Well, the others do[br]a good job with it anyway.

00:43:48.27,00:43:50.36
Well, let's see it then.

00:43:52.57,00:43:56.16
"The Lamentable Tale of Lady Ursula."

00:43:56.57,00:43:58.57
"One morning, just after sunrise,

00:43:58.57,00:44:02.16
Lady Ursula, the most beautiful daughter[br]of Lord and Lady Dubon,

00:44:02.37,00:44:07.63
made her way up the steps of the great[br]cathedral to pray to her blessed saint."

00:44:08.00,00:44:10.73
"Suddenly, as she reached[br]the cathedral doors,

00:44:10.73,00:44:13.46
the gargoyle that guarded[br]the sacred structure

00:44:13.80,00:44:16.34
came to life and swooped down upon her."

00:44:16.47,00:44:18.55
(Sylvia coughs)

00:44:18.80,00:44:20.93
"The people of the village all ran to safety,

00:44:20.97,00:44:23.77
but Lady Ursula slipped[br]on the cathedral steps

00:44:23.77,00:44:27.94
and the gargoyle descended upon her,[br]wrapping her in its huge wings

00:44:28.27,00:44:32.53
and taking her high up into the spires[br]of the cathedral."

00:44:32.78,00:44:36.15
- Go on, Peter.[br]- "Not long after this sorrowful event,

00:44:36.40,00:44:40.95
a young knight named JM Barnaby[br]came into the city."

00:44:41.70,00:44:43.95
Sylvia.

00:44:44.29,00:44:46.66
- Do you want some water?[br]- Mother?

00:44:46.79,00:44:50.25
- No, James.[br]- Let's get her back to the house. Go on.

00:44:53.88,00:44:57.93
She won't discuss it with me at all.[br]She claims it was nothing.

00:44:57.93,00:45:00.89
I tell you, Doctor, she couldn't breathe.

00:45:00.89,00:45:04.43
You can't very well treat a patient[br]who won't admit there's anything wrong.

00:45:04.89,00:45:08.35
Well, you'll have to make her understand[br]that something is.

00:45:08.39,00:45:12.15
- I'll try and do my best.[br]- Great. Just there.

00:45:42.97,00:45:45.26
Get your hand flat like that.

00:45:46.39,00:45:48.35
Ow.

00:45:49.39,00:45:51.65
Then... Like that.

00:46:16.09,00:46:18.13
(knock at door)

00:46:18.17,00:46:20.26
Come in.

00:46:29.18,00:46:32.85
The good doctor didn't feel[br]up to the challenge on this one.

00:46:33.19,00:46:36.65
He thinks you need to go to hospital[br]for further tests.

00:46:36.69,00:46:40.15
Nonsense.[br]When would I have time for that?

00:46:40.19,00:46:44.45
Besides, this family's[br]had enough of hospitals.

00:46:45.70,00:46:49.25
- Perhaps they can help you.[br]- I know what they can do for me.

00:46:49.70,00:46:52.71
I saw what they did for my husband.

00:46:52.71,00:46:55.96
No, James. I've no interest in hospitals.

00:46:57.17,00:46:59.76
I'm keenly interested[br]in having some supper.

00:47:02.17,00:47:04.26
(banging and crashing)

00:47:29.58,00:47:34.04
What did you and Mother decide[br]to tell us this time? "It's only a chest cold"?

00:47:34.50,00:47:36.96
- We hadn't decided anything.[br]- Stop lying to me!

00:47:36.96,00:47:40.05
I'm sick of grown-ups lying to me.

00:47:40.38,00:47:43.30
I'm not lying to you.[br]I don't know what's wrong.

00:47:43.30,00:47:47.76
"Father might take us fishing,"[br]that's what she said. "In just a few weeks."

00:47:48.10,00:47:50.51
And he died the next morning.

00:47:50.52,00:47:52.93
That wasn't a lie, Peter.

00:47:53.27,00:47:54.27
That was your mother's hope.

00:47:54.27,00:47:58.65
He barely moved for a week,[br]but I started planning our fishing trip.

00:47:58.90,00:48:02.86
I will never lie to you. I promise you that.

00:48:02.99,00:48:06.53
No, all you'll do is teach me[br]to make up stupid stories

00:48:06.91,00:48:11.33
and pretend that things[br]aren't happening until...

00:48:14.87,00:48:17.25
I won't! I'm not blind.

00:48:17.50,00:48:19.96
I won't be made a fool.

00:48:20.80,00:48:23.84
What's this? Peter.

00:48:24.17,00:48:26.26
The play.

00:48:26.80,00:48:30.05
Darling, I wanted to see the rest of it.

00:48:31.81,00:48:35.23
Magic's gone out of it a bit now,[br]hasn't it?

00:48:35.77,00:48:38.44
All because of a silly chest cold.

00:49:08.09,00:49:11.26
(speak in low voices)

00:49:22.77,00:49:24.65
James.

00:49:26.78,00:49:29.16
Well, you remember Gilbert Cannan,[br]don't you?

00:49:29.28,00:49:30.28
Good evening.

00:49:30.28,00:49:36.45
Mr Cannan has been working on the[br]committee to fight government censorship.

00:49:36.79,00:49:39.25
I know how involved you've been as well.

00:49:39.29,00:49:44.55
He wanted to speak to you.[br]I did think you'd be home so much sooner.

00:49:44.80,00:49:47.34
It's been a long evening, Mary.

00:49:48.30,00:49:50.26
Yes.

00:49:50.30,00:49:52.80
Well, if I'd realized how late it was,[br]of course.

00:49:52.80,00:49:56.06
I should perhaps talk to you[br]at another time? Not so late?

00:49:56.31,00:49:58.35
That will be fine.

00:50:00.77,00:50:02.77
We'll talk then.

00:50:02.77,00:50:05.65
Thank you for your patience, Mrs Barrie.

00:50:05.78,00:50:07.53
Mr Barrie.

00:50:07.78,00:50:09.95
- Good night.[br]- Night.

00:50:27.00,00:50:30.03
Well, aren't you going to speak?

00:50:30.03,00:50:33.05
What would you like me to say?

00:50:33.89,00:50:37.26
"Curious how late Mr Cannan stayed,"[br]I suppose.

00:50:37.39,00:50:40.85
And then, let's see. What comes next?

00:50:42.90,00:50:45.86
"No later than you were out, James."

00:50:45.90,00:50:48.65
"And how is Mrs Davies this evening?"

00:50:49.57,00:50:51.95
Oh, yes, I would have a great answer[br]for that one, wouldn't I?

00:50:51.95,00:50:53.66
How dare you.

00:50:56.20,00:50:58.54
This isn't one of your plays.

00:50:58.70,00:51:02.46
I know that, Mary. It's quite serious.

00:51:05.00,00:51:08.13
But I'm not ready for this conversation,[br]wherever it may lead.

00:51:08.50,00:51:13.34
Perhaps we can talk in the morning, yes?[br]Good night then.

00:51:20.47,00:51:22.56
(door shuts)

00:52:36.38,00:52:40.81
Mr Barrie. Don't you agree[br]this is a little bit tight?

00:52:40.81,00:52:45.23
- No. No, in fact I think it's quite... baggy.[br]- Baggy?

00:52:45.39,00:52:48.06
Quite frumpy. I'd bring it right in just there.

00:52:48.19,00:52:49.73
That's very tight.

00:52:50.19,00:52:52.65
And put maybe a plank of wood there[br]to straighten him up.

00:52:52.69,00:52:54.65
- Oh, aye. Yes, Mr Barrie.[br]- Plank of wood?

00:52:54.69,00:52:57.03
Some wood there on the shoulders as well.

00:52:57.20,00:53:01.03
- Otherwise, it's marvelous.[br]- Right, sir.

00:53:01.99,00:53:03.83
(Porthos barks)

00:53:12.30,00:53:13.25
(gasps)

00:53:13.38,00:53:16.26
- You'll be sick tomorrow.[br]- I'll be sick tonight.

00:53:16.38,00:53:19.14
(quacking)

00:53:20.30,00:53:22.64
James.

00:53:22.81,00:53:26.56
We're just having some tea.[br]You remember my mother, of course.

00:53:26.77,00:53:29.94
Yes. Of course. How do you do?

00:53:32.27,00:53:36.15
- May I take your hat?[br]- (Mrs du Maurier) That's enough, boys.

00:53:39.57,00:53:42.03
Boys, please don't run in the house.[br]You'll break something.

00:53:42.37,00:53:44.33
Come away from that door.[br]Come on, come on.

00:53:44.49,00:53:47.66
(Mrs du Maurier) I'd like a word with you,[br]Mr Barrie, before you go.

00:53:47.66,00:53:49.75
We'll only be a few minutes.

00:53:50.21,00:53:52.46
Boys, why don't you go[br]and play in the garden? Go on.

00:53:52.46,00:53:54.05
- Is he in trouble?[br]- Sh.

00:53:54.50,00:53:58.34
Because I've been alone with Grandmother[br]and I know what it's like.

00:53:58.51,00:54:02.55
- Should we retire into the study?[br]- Why don't you join them, dear?

00:54:02.55,00:54:04.26
V ery well.

00:54:06.47,00:54:09.85
- I do apologize for interrupting.[br]- Would you close the door, please?

00:54:10.10,00:54:11.60
Certainly.

00:54:11.60,00:54:16.65
Sylvia has told me you have offered her[br]the services of your household staff.

00:54:16.65,00:54:20.86
- Well, not exactly.[br]- That won't be necessary.

00:54:21.20,00:54:23.37
I'll leave that to Sylvia, of course.

00:54:24.08,00:54:26.20
You'll leave that to me, Mr Barrie.

00:54:26.20,00:54:29.20
You see, I'm moving in here from now on.

00:54:29.21,00:54:33.83
- You're moving in?[br]- I'm going where I'm most needed.

00:54:34.09,00:54:36.75
And I can certainly see to it[br]that this house is managed

00:54:37.00,00:54:39.26
without resorting to your charity.

00:54:39.38,00:54:44.26
It isn't charity, Mrs du Maurier.[br]I was only trying to help, as a friend.

00:54:44.30,00:54:48.56
Have you no idea how much your[br]friendship has already cost my daughter?

00:54:48.77,00:54:51.44
Or are you really that selfish?

00:54:51.69,00:54:54.23
I beg your pardon?

00:54:54.61,00:54:58.65
Don't you see what a visit[br]to the summer cottage of a married man

00:54:58.65,00:55:01.74
does for a widow's future prospects?

00:55:03.41,00:55:07.33
Sylvia needs to find someone.[br]The boys need a father.

00:55:10.29,00:55:14.75
And you are destroying any hope this[br]family has of pulling itself together again.

00:55:14.79,00:55:18.55
I have only wanted good things[br]for this family, Mrs du Maurier.

00:55:18.55,00:55:21.05
I'll look after them.

00:55:22.47,00:55:25.26
You have your own family[br]to concern yourself with.

00:55:25.30,00:55:27.05
What are you suggesting?

00:55:27.10,00:55:31.06
I'm suggesting that you protect[br]what you have, Mr Barrie.

00:55:31.39,00:55:35.15
That is precisely what I am doing.

00:55:57.29,00:56:00.96
I was so certain what I would find in this.

00:56:01.38,00:56:06.14
Some little confession[br]would leak out onto the page.

00:56:06.39,00:56:08.76
I don't write love notes in my journal.

00:56:08.80,00:56:11.27
No.

00:56:11.39,00:56:14.85
Still, you knew who I meant, didn't you?

00:56:14.89,00:56:17.65
That's some comfort, actually.

00:56:18.48,00:56:21.15
It means I know you just a little after all.

00:56:21.28,00:56:24.95
You needn't steal my journal[br]to get to know me, Mary.

00:56:25.07,00:56:29.53
No. I suppose I could just go see the plays.

00:56:31.99,00:56:36.75
I was hopelessly naive when I married you.

00:56:37.88,00:56:43.34
I imagined that brilliant people[br]disappeared to some secret place

00:56:43.34,00:56:47.34
where good ideas floated around[br]like leaves in autumn.

00:56:47.97,00:56:52.64
And I hoped, at least once...

00:56:54.10,00:56:56.94
you would take me there with you.

00:56:57.10,00:57:00.06
There is no such place.

00:57:01.48,00:57:03.53
Yes, there is.

00:57:05.19,00:57:07.24
Neverland.

00:57:09.70,00:57:12.28
It's the best you've written, James.

00:57:12.28,00:57:16.33
And I'm sure the Davies will adore[br]the world you've created for them.

00:57:16.79,00:57:19.83
I only wish I were part of it.

00:57:20.79,00:57:24.34
I've wanted you to be. I've tried.

00:57:27.97,00:57:29.47
Mary.

00:57:29.47,00:57:34.35
I always imagined us going off on[br]great adventures once we were together.

00:57:34.47,00:57:38.06
But we moved into this house[br]and you started, I don't know,

00:57:38.60,00:57:42.36
- you started rearranging the furniture.[br]- What was I supposed to do, James?

00:57:42.61,00:57:43.82
You were always gone.

00:57:43.82,00:57:45.03
I was right here.

00:57:45.57,00:57:52.53
Sitting in your parlor, staring off[br]into other worlds as though I didn't exist.

00:57:53.49,00:57:56.04
Look. Just give me bit more time[br]to finish up the play.

00:57:56.20,00:57:58.16
To spend with your muse?

00:57:58.21,00:58:03.75
No, I'm tired of waiting, James.[br]I'm tired of looking like a fool.

00:58:05.09,00:58:08.34
Well, I can't very well give up the play.

00:58:09.47,00:58:12.14
Of course not.

00:58:12.47,00:58:17.93
Just come home to me at the end of[br]the day. Rehearse and be home for dinner.

00:58:18.18,00:58:23.06
No more trips to the country,[br]no more long afternoons in the park.

00:58:23.07,00:58:27.23
If you can't give us that much of a chance,

00:58:27.69,00:58:30.66
then we must end this.

00:58:31.49,00:58:34.33
And I will.

00:58:39.37,00:58:41.83
Pitiful display.

00:58:45.88,00:58:46.96
(whistle)

00:58:47.38,00:58:49.55
(James) Nanny. Nanny.

00:58:49.55,00:58:51.93
What?

00:58:54.39,00:58:57.77
First you get the pajamas,[br]then you make the bed.

00:58:57.77,00:58:59.73
With my paws?

00:59:00.18,00:59:04.21
You make the bed with your paws.[br]The pajamas you get with your teeth.

00:59:04.21,00:59:08.23
Because in fact, being a dog,[br]you haven't any proper digits, have you?

00:59:09.28,00:59:11.74
Well, I don't have any teeth, either.

00:59:11.78,00:59:14.24
I mean, I can't see. I can't breathe.

00:59:14.57,00:59:17.74
All I've got is this rubbery snout.

00:59:20.71,00:59:24.63
- Can we get him some teeth?[br]- He can have mine.

00:59:24.67,00:59:26.84
We'll get you teeth.

00:59:27.17,00:59:30.55
- Let's have a wee break, shall we?[br]- Right.

00:59:33.47,00:59:34.84
- I thought you were wonderful.[br]- You were marvelous.

00:59:35.39,00:59:37.35
I think you're better on four legs[br]than you are on two.

00:59:37.39,00:59:39.85
- Oh, give it a rest.[br]- I do.

00:59:41.39,00:59:44.35
- Just say it, Charles, go on.[br]- Well, you picture it, James.

00:59:44.40,00:59:48.07
Opening night, doctors, lawyers,[br]businessmen and their wives,

00:59:48.40,00:59:49.86
all dressed to the nines.

00:59:49.90,00:59:54.53
They've paid good money, they're[br]expecting theater, what we call theater.

00:59:54.53,00:59:59.16
The curtain opens and it's crocodiles[br]and fairies and pirates and Indians.

00:59:59.37,01:00:02.75
I don't even know what it is.

01:00:02.87,01:00:07.13
But you did know, Charles. You're[br]an absolute genius, Charles. That's it.

01:00:07.38,01:00:09.25
Oh, don't patronize me, James.

01:00:09.38,01:00:12.34
You know how much money I put into[br]this show that I haven't even found yet?

01:00:12.67,01:00:15.84
Listen, listen. Opening night,[br]I want 25 seats set aside.

01:00:15.84,01:00:17.68
- Set aside? 25?[br]- 25 seats.

01:00:17.68,01:00:20.35
Scattered throughout the theater.[br]Two here, two there, three up there.

01:00:20.68,01:00:22.64
- Are they paying for it?[br]- They're filled.

01:00:22.68,01:00:25.06
- No, no, no. I'm asking...[br]- The seats are filled.

01:00:25.19,01:00:27.73
- Uncle Jim?[br]- Hello, boys.

01:00:28.19,01:00:29.44
Could I speak to you for a moment,[br]please?

01:00:29.44,01:00:30.86
Certainly.

01:00:31.19,01:00:34.15
25 seats, Charles. It'll be great.[br]It'll be fantastic.

01:00:34.20,01:00:35.74
25 scattered seats?[br]Who's paying for them?

01:00:35.74,01:00:36.66
Throughout the theater.

01:00:37.20,01:00:40.66
- Who's paying for these 25 seats?[br]- They're filled-up seats, Charles.

01:00:40.70,01:00:42.70
Whoa. Look.

01:00:42.70,01:00:45.46
This is great. I'm flying.

01:00:45.58,01:00:49.84
We don't need to use much pull at all, see?[br]As long as we've got the balance down.

01:00:50.17,01:00:52.63
Mother asked me to take the boys out[br]for the afternoon.

01:00:52.80,01:00:55.30
She said she only wanted a bit of quiet,

01:00:55.30,01:00:59.64
but she was trembling so badly[br]she couldn't even finish her tea.

01:00:59.68,01:01:02.85
I'm not a fool, Uncle James.[br]I deserve to know the truth.

01:01:03.10,01:01:06.44
I don't know the truth.[br]She won't talk about it.

01:01:06.44,01:01:08.85
But you think it's serious?

01:01:10.98,01:01:13.73
It could be. The doctor felt[br]she should go and have some tests.

01:01:13.99,01:01:15.74
Then you'll have to convince her[br]to go then.

01:01:15.99,01:01:18.36
I've tried. She won't listen to me.

01:01:19.57,01:01:20.57
And lately, to be quite honest,

01:01:20.57,01:01:25.25
it seems that all my best intentions for[br]your family have come to nothing but harm.

01:01:25.58,01:01:27.75
Apparently I've made[br]quite a mess of things.

01:01:28.08,01:01:31.25
It's Grandmother, isn't it?[br]She's run you off, hasn't she?

01:01:31.29,01:01:36.47
Oh, she's absolutely tried with great effort.[br]And perhaps with good reason.

01:01:36.47,01:01:39.84
It isn't you, Uncle Jim. She just...

01:01:39.89,01:01:44.14
She just doesn't want[br]to see Mother hurt anymore.

01:01:47.77,01:01:50.65
Look at that.

01:01:50.77,01:01:53.36
How magnificent.

01:01:54.48,01:01:56.53
The boy's gone.

01:01:58.99,01:02:03.47
Somewhere during the last 30 seconds,[br]you've become a grown-up.

01:02:03.47,01:02:07.96
Right then. I think you should be the one[br]to talk to her, George.

01:02:08.29,01:02:14.05
- But I wouldn't know what to say.[br]- You'll do fine. You'll do just fine.

01:02:14.09,01:02:17.09
Mr Barrie, sir. Sorry to interrupt.

01:02:17.09,01:02:21.26
- It's Nana, he's expired backstage.[br]- What's happened?

01:02:21.59,01:02:24.35
I think his costume is too tight.

01:02:24.60,01:02:29.94
It's not possible, too tight.[br]George, give me a minute, I'll be back.

01:02:30.10,01:02:32.56
(laughter from the boys)

01:02:33.40,01:02:38.03
(stage manager) Pull that one tight.[br]Here, last one.

01:02:39.90,01:02:42.03
OK. Flap those wings.

01:02:42.03,01:02:44.16
- There you go.[br]- Whoa!

01:02:44.99,01:02:47.45
- Can I have a go?[br]- Yeah, you can have a little go if you want.

01:02:47.50,01:02:48.96
Give that a tug. Go on.

01:02:49.00,01:02:51.33
- Just give it a little pull.[br]- (Michael) Can I have a go?

01:02:51.50,01:02:52.83
- In a minute. In a minute.[br]- Can I have a go?

01:02:53.00,01:02:54.96
- Jack. Pull me higher.[br]- I have to concentrate.

01:02:55.00,01:02:56.63
- Stop it now, boys.[br]- No, Michael.

01:02:56.88,01:02:58.34
Stop mucking about, boys. Come on now.

01:02:58.38,01:03:00.26
- I want to do it now.[br]- No, don't go down there.

01:03:00.80,01:03:01.93
What are you...?

01:03:04.68,01:03:06.26
Ow!

01:03:10.48,01:03:12.73
(stage manager) Oh, no. Oh, no, I'm sorry.

01:03:12.77,01:03:15.86
- I'm so sorry.[br]- (Jack) George?

01:03:22.07,01:03:23.45
Mr Barrie?

01:03:23.57,01:03:27.16
Mrs Davies would like a word with you.

01:03:27.49,01:03:29.75
No, just Mr Barrie.

01:03:46.10,01:03:51.35
- Did you encourage this?[br]- Encourage what?

01:03:51.39,01:03:55.56
Oh, James, please.[br]You know perfectly well what.

01:03:56.40,01:04:02.65
George won't allow them to set his arm[br]unless I submit to an examination.

01:04:04.20,01:04:07.24
I see. Well, I suppose you'll have to then,

01:04:07.70,01:04:12.75
because he's quite a stubborn young man[br]when he sets his mind to it.

01:04:12.87,01:04:17.63
This is absurd.[br]They won't tell me anything different.

01:04:17.63,01:04:19.84
Different?

01:04:20.00,01:04:22.47
So you've already spoken to a doctor then?

01:04:23.01,01:04:25.64
That is not your concern.

01:04:31.31,01:04:35.56
(Sylvia, quietly) My understanding[br]is that my condition may be quite serious.

01:04:35.90,01:04:40.65
However... my wish is that[br]life should go on as normal.

01:04:41.57,01:04:43.03
So,

01:04:43.57,01:04:46.07
I'll have the examination,

01:04:46.07,01:04:49.16
and I'll take whatever medications[br]they advise.

01:04:49.16,01:04:51.83
But I don't want to know what they're for.

01:04:52.08,01:04:56.17
And I don't want you inquiring into it[br]any further.

01:04:57.08,01:04:59.46
Wouldn't dream of it.

01:05:00.59,01:05:03.26
(clock strikes three)

01:05:18.19,01:05:20.23
Mary?

01:05:22.19,01:05:24.44
Mary? (knocks)

01:05:45.59,01:05:48.43
Peter, could you help George[br]to fold a pocket handkerchief, please?

01:05:48.68,01:05:51.93
- They're in the linen cupboard. Darling?[br]- Yes, Mother.

01:05:51.93,01:05:55.73
Jack, how do you manage[br]to always come untucked?

01:05:55.98,01:05:58.14
Would you check your shirt-tails[br]in the intermission, please?

01:05:58.48,01:05:59.65
Yes, Mother.

01:05:59.98,01:06:02.44
You're not planning on attending[br]any after-theater events, are you?

01:06:02.48,01:06:06.15
Only for a short time if we do. The tickets!

01:06:06.19,01:06:08.19
- With the children?[br]- George!

01:06:08.20,01:06:11.43
Um, possibly. Would you see[br]if George has the tickets, please?

01:06:11.43,01:06:14.66
- I'll just check the dressing table.[br]- Sylvia, there's a...

01:06:15.20,01:06:19.75
Mother, please see if George has[br]the tickets. Michael, where are your socks?

01:06:19.75,01:06:22.04
Wait here, don't move.

01:06:22.88,01:06:25.25
(coughs)

01:06:28.51,01:06:30.55
(coughs)

01:06:42.69,01:06:45.23
(orchestra warms up)

01:06:56.70,01:06:59.54
Take her feet, George.

01:07:01.71,01:07:04.04
We'll need some more blankets.

01:07:05.29,01:07:08.26
Oh, take Michael with you, would you?

01:07:10.80,01:07:15.05
She looks much worse[br]than when we were at the cottage.

01:07:15.30,01:07:18.31
(George, whispering) Sh, Michael.

01:07:18.31,01:07:21.23
- Those 25 seats, has anyone shown up?[br]- No, sir. Not yet.

01:07:21.27,01:07:23.73
Precisely. Have there been[br]many people asking for seats?

01:07:24.40,01:07:25.23
- Yes, sir.[br]- (James) Charles.

01:07:25.40,01:07:27.36
I suggest you start selling them.[br]Yes, James?

01:07:27.48,01:07:29.24
Have you seen any of the Davies family[br]yet this evening?

01:07:29.24,01:07:30.24
The 25 seats, are they filled?

01:07:30.49,01:07:32.15
- It's taken care of.[br]- Yes. Yes.

01:07:32.49,01:07:35.53
Who did you invite? Because obviously[br]whoever you invited decided not to come.

01:07:35.57,01:07:38.16
- The seats will be filled, I promise.[br]- Yes. You've been promising me all...

01:07:38.16,01:07:39.66
- Charles?[br]- Hello, Mr Stanley.

01:07:40.08,01:07:41.75
Have you seen the Davies family[br]this evening?

01:07:41.75,01:07:42.54
No, sir.

01:07:43.50,01:07:46.63
- Jack has gone to get Dr Brighton.[br]- Oh, no, Mother. I don't need a doctor.

01:07:46.63,01:07:48.55
Yes, you do, dear.

01:07:50.51,01:07:53.43
I think I'll get some camomile[br]to help you relax.

01:07:53.47,01:07:57.43
Peter will be here if you need anything.

01:08:03.48,01:08:05.06
Peter.

01:08:05.48,01:08:07.44
Peter.

01:08:15.49,01:08:17.83
Can I do anything, Mother?

01:08:17.99,01:08:20.04
No, darling.

01:08:21.50,01:08:23.83
You must go to the play.

01:08:25.00,01:08:29.05
- I can't do that.[br]- Yes, you can.

01:08:29.05,01:08:31.55
I need you to.

01:08:31.88,01:08:36.64
I need you to come back tonight[br]and tell me every bit of it.

01:08:36.89,01:08:38.39
Please.

01:08:38.39,01:08:41.35
It's only a play, Mother.

01:08:41.39,01:08:44.23
It doesn't matter.

01:08:48.77,01:08:50.94
What do you want?

01:08:51.28,01:08:54.03
(Sylvia) Take it out.

01:08:56.28,01:08:58.95
Open it.

01:09:08.08,01:09:11.46
I've never been so proud of you.

01:09:24.77,01:09:27.65
Last call, please, ladies and gentlemen.[br]Last call.

01:09:27.65,01:09:30.56
Yes, yes, yes. It's all right. They know.

01:09:30.77,01:09:34.53
We had time to sell those 25 seats.[br]The play's starting.

01:09:46.87,01:09:47.83
- Charles.[br]- What?

01:09:47.87,01:09:51.75
- They're here.[br]- Who's here?

01:09:54.88,01:09:58.43
Do forgive them being a bit late -[br]short legs, long walk from the orphanage.

01:09:58.43,01:10:00.55
I'm not clear what they're doing here.

01:10:00.89,01:10:02.43
- They've come to see the play.[br]- Mm-hm.

01:10:02.43,01:10:04.27
- That's the 25 seats.[br]- Mm.

01:10:04.39,01:10:08.44
25 seats given to orphans. Right.[br]Now my nightmare is complete.

01:10:08.89,01:10:10.86
You can start your play now.

01:10:10.90,01:10:12.86
Your play.

01:10:17.90,01:10:20.87
(Charles) Get them in the scattered seats.

01:10:29.50,01:10:31.96
(overture plays)

01:10:36.01,01:10:39.13
(usher, whispering) Just there, boys.

01:11:10.58,01:11:13.63
(usher) Excuse me, sir. This way.

01:11:13.63,01:11:15.63
(Peter) Thank you.

01:11:16.09,01:11:19.13
Looks like we got[br]one of the better-dressed ones.

01:11:19.59,01:11:24.05
I just want you to know,[br]I think you're a wonderful dog.

01:11:24.10,01:11:26.35
Thanks.

01:11:59.67,01:12:02.43
(barks)

01:12:04.59,01:12:07.05
(giggling)

01:12:18.27,01:12:20.94
(children laugh)

01:12:22.49,01:12:24.45
(Nana barks)

01:12:25.99,01:12:29.95
- I won't go to bed. I won't. I won't.[br]- (Nana barks)

01:12:29.95,01:12:31.33
Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet.

01:12:31.87,01:12:34.17
- Two minutes more.[br]- (Nana growls)

01:12:34.17,01:12:36.33
Please. One minute more.

01:12:36.79,01:12:41.55
Nana, I will not be bathed.[br]I tell you, I will not be bathed.

01:12:41.55,01:12:43.92
(Nana barks, she squeaks)

01:12:46.59,01:12:49.14
(actress) Who are you?

01:12:55.77,01:13:00.44
No one there. Yet I feel sure I saw a face.

01:13:01.28,01:13:03.65
My children.

01:13:04.99,01:13:08.24
- How is she?[br]- She's resting.

01:13:08.49,01:13:10.37
- May I see her?[br]- No, Mr Barrie.

01:13:10.37,01:13:13.33
I don't think we need to include you in[br]everything that goes on in this household.

01:13:13.70,01:13:15.75
- But she'd want to see him.[br]- Be quiet, George.

01:13:15.75,01:13:16.96
And since, as I've discovered,

01:13:17.00,01:13:20.84
you've seen fit to conceal certain facts[br]about my daughter's condition from me,

01:13:21.30,01:13:24.26
I feel no remorse at excluding you[br]from my home.

01:13:24.26,01:13:25.13
But you can't...

01:13:25.59,01:13:29.05
- Go upstairs, George, now.[br]- Stop ordering me about.

01:13:29.10,01:13:31.26
This isn't your home. It's our home.

01:13:31.60,01:13:33.56
Just cos Mother's[br]needed your help recently

01:13:33.60,01:13:35.85
doesn't give you the right[br]to rule over her existence.

01:13:35.85,01:13:38.23
She's not a child anymore,[br]and neither am I.

01:13:38.60,01:13:40.94
If she wants to see Uncle Jim,[br]she can see Uncle Jim.

01:13:40.94,01:13:43.94
There's nothing you can do about it.

01:13:45.40,01:13:47.45
(coughs)

01:13:47.91,01:13:50.83
- Mother?[br]- Yes, darling?

01:13:53.37,01:13:55.87
James.

01:13:55.87,01:13:58.54
No. Your play.

01:14:01.38,01:14:04.34
Look at all this.

01:14:04.38,01:14:06.63
I'd have come tonight, it's just...

01:14:06.88,01:14:09.93
- Mother, you need to rest.[br]...I still have things to do here.

01:14:10.89,01:14:13.89
See? This needs mending.

01:14:13.89,01:14:17.44
Four boys, no end of patches.

01:14:17.44,01:14:20.23
Can't seem to keep up.

01:14:21.40,01:14:24.15
I haven't the time for all this.

01:14:24.98,01:14:30.87
Don't look at me like that, James.[br]You make me feel so utterly exposed.

01:14:32.70,01:14:38.16
Boys, would you give me a moment[br]with your mother, please? Thank you.

01:14:57.98,01:15:00.65
(James) They can see it, you know.

01:15:01.98,01:15:04.36
You can't go on just pretending.

01:15:05.48,01:15:08.36
"Just pretending"?

01:15:10.49,01:15:14.33
You brought pretending[br]into this family, James.

01:15:15.99,01:15:18.96
You showed us we can change things[br]by simply believing them to be different.

01:15:19.00,01:15:21.46
A lot of things, Sylvia, not everything.

01:15:21.50,01:15:24.63
But the things that matter.

01:15:25.80,01:15:32.26
We've pretended for some time now[br]that you're a part of this family, haven't we?

01:15:37.31,01:15:44.36
You've come to mean so much to us all[br]that now it doesn't matter if it's true.

01:15:47.78,01:15:50.15
And even if it isn't true,

01:15:50.99,01:15:53.95
even if that can never be...

01:15:56.49,01:15:59.45
I need to go on pretending.

01:16:01.50,01:16:03.67
Until the end.

01:16:06.00,01:16:08.05
With you.

01:16:09.01,01:16:13.34
- (actress) Oh, I am sweet.[br]- (actor) How do you do it?

01:16:13.68,01:16:18.26
You just think lovely, wonderful thoughts[br]and they lift you up in the air.

01:16:18.27,01:16:21.14
(gasps)

01:16:21.18,01:16:26.65
You are so nippy at it.[br]Couldn't you do it very slowly once?

01:16:30.57,01:16:34.45
- Yes, I've got it now, Wendy.[br]- (audience laughs)

01:16:34.57,01:16:37.83
I must blow fairy dust on you first.

01:16:46.08,01:16:47.13
(spits)

01:16:47.59,01:16:50.05
Now try. Try it from the beds.

01:16:50.67,01:16:54.55
Just wriggle your shoulders like this[br]and then let go.

01:16:54.68,01:16:56.14
(she gasps, audience gasps)

01:16:56.30,01:16:59.35
- I flew![br]- How ripping!

01:16:59.97,01:17:01.93
Now join hands.

01:17:05.98,01:17:08.86
- Look at me![br]- (Michael) I do like it!

01:17:10.98,01:17:14.24
- (man in audience) Bravo![br]- (Peter Pan) Let's go out.

01:17:14.57,01:17:18.45
Second on the right[br]and straight on till morning.

01:17:18.57,01:17:20.83
Genius.

01:17:24.71,01:17:29.54
- (James) Sylvia, don't move.[br]- I feel a little better.

01:17:29.67,01:17:33.34
(she sighs) It's been a bad day, that's all.

01:17:34.67,01:17:37.64
Now I want you to go back to the theater.

01:17:37.68,01:17:40.26
Find Peter.

01:17:40.30,01:17:44.23
- Of course.[br]- Thank you.

01:17:47.77,01:17:51.86
Are you sure there's nothing else[br]I can do for you?

01:17:52.78,01:17:54.86
No.

01:17:56.78,01:17:58.28
Well,

01:17:58.28,01:18:01.45
I have always wanted to go to Neverland.

01:18:01.87,01:18:04.95
You did promise to tell me about it,[br]you know.

01:18:05.50,01:18:08.46
Aye. That I did.

01:18:09.67,01:18:13.05
It's a bit late for it tonight though, I'm afraid.

01:18:14.67,01:18:18.13
Perhaps some time soon though?

01:18:25.10,01:18:27.60
Most definitely.

01:18:27.60,01:18:32.73
- D'you mean we shall both be drowned?[br]- (Peter Pan) Look how the water is rising.

01:18:36.07,01:18:39.57
It must be the tail of the kite[br]we made for Michael.

01:18:39.57,01:18:44.83
You remember. It tore itself[br]out of his hands and floated away.

01:18:46.08,01:18:50.63
- The kite. Why shouldn't it carry you?[br]- Both of us.

01:18:51.58,01:18:54.96
It can't lift two. Michael and Curly tried.

01:18:54.96,01:18:57.63
I won't go without you, Peter.

01:18:58.09,01:19:00.64
Let us draw lots which is to stay behind.

01:19:00.64,01:19:03.55
And you a lady? Never.

01:19:06.60,01:19:08.14
- Ready, Wendy?[br]- (gust of wind)

01:19:08.14,01:19:10.06
Peter!

01:19:10.10,01:19:12.56
Don't let go, Wendy.

01:19:12.61,01:19:15.07
Peter, I'm frightened.

01:19:15.11,01:19:17.94
Hang on, Wendy!

01:19:19.57,01:19:21.20
Peter!

01:19:21.20,01:19:24.95
To die will be an awfully big adventure.

01:19:41.38,01:19:43.93
- I'm glad you came.[br]- Well...

01:19:45.39,01:19:49.06
I've never missed an opening.

01:19:49.06,01:19:50.94
So I...

01:19:51.89,01:19:54.94
assume you heard about Gilbert and I.

01:19:54.94,01:19:56.73
Yes.

01:19:57.90,01:20:00.24
Quite the scandal, so I'm told.

01:20:07.87,01:20:10.66
How are you?

01:20:15.00,01:20:17.75
I'm all right.

01:20:18.00,01:20:20.34
How are you?

01:20:21.51,01:20:24.14
I'm sorry.

01:20:26.97,01:20:29.64
Don't be.

01:20:29.97,01:20:35.06
Without that family, you could[br]never have written anything like this.

01:20:35.06,01:20:37.57
You need them.

01:20:38.98,01:20:42.53
(applause and cheering)

01:20:44.49,01:20:47.24
Goodbye.

01:20:58.59,01:21:00.84
- Mr Barrie.[br]- Mrs Snow.

01:21:01.59,01:21:05.43
Thank you. That was quite the nicest[br]evening I've ever spent in the theater.

01:21:05.43,01:21:08.64
V ery kind of you to say. Thank you.[br]Where's Mr Snow this evening?

01:21:09.10,01:21:10.10
Oh.

01:21:10.10,01:21:12.93
I'm afraid he's left us.

01:21:13.10,01:21:16.06
And he would so have loved this evening.

01:21:16.10,01:21:18.56
The pirates and the Indians.

01:21:19.11,01:21:22.94
He was really just a boy himself, you know.

01:21:22.94,01:21:25.36
To the very end.

01:21:25.57,01:21:28.82
I'm terribly sorry. How are you doing?

01:21:29.08,01:21:32.99
I'm doing well enough now, thank you.

01:21:33.00,01:21:38.25
I suppose it's all the work[br]of the ticking crocodile, isn't it?

01:21:38.79,01:21:43.55
Time is chasing after all of us.[br]Isn't that right?

01:21:44.59,01:21:47.55
- That's right, Mrs Snow.[br]- Aunt Rose, your drink.

01:21:47.59,01:21:50.93
Thank you. I mustn't keep you.[br]You've a lot of friends here.

01:21:51.10,01:21:54.56
Well, it's lovely to see you.[br]I'm terribly sorry, once again.

01:21:56.10,01:21:59.86
- Was that Mr Barrie?[br]- That was Mr Barrie.

01:22:00.11,01:22:02.86
Well done, Mr Barrie.

01:22:03.07,01:22:05.86
- Good show.[br]- Well done.

01:22:09.28,01:22:12.03
Psst.

01:22:12.29,01:22:14.33
What did you think?

01:22:14.87,01:22:17.83
- It's about our summer together, isn't it?[br]- It is.

01:22:17.87,01:22:20.04
- About all of us.[br]- That's right.

01:22:21.88,01:22:24.55
Did you like it?

01:22:24.88,01:22:27.55
It's magical. Thank you.

01:22:27.88,01:22:30.26
Oh, thank you.

01:22:30.39,01:22:32.14
Thank you, Peter.

01:22:32.39,01:22:36.43
- This is Peter Pan! How wonderful.[br]- (man) Really?

01:22:36.89,01:22:40.35
You're Peter Pan? Why, you must be[br]quite the little adventurer.

01:22:40.40,01:22:43.57
(woman) Look, it's true.[br]He has no shadow.

01:22:44.90,01:22:47.36
But I'm not Peter Pan.

01:22:47.57,01:22:49.95
- He is.[br]- (laughter)

01:23:00.37,01:23:05.05
(man) And there's been no improvement[br]since my last visit?

01:23:05.05,01:23:06.96
(Sylvia) No.

01:23:12.30,01:23:15.77
Has James been by at all today, Mother?

01:23:16.81,01:23:17.73
(knock)

01:23:18.27,01:23:20.44
Dr Brighton. May I have a word?

01:23:22.19,01:23:24.86
Excuse me a moment.

01:23:29.28,01:23:32.74
You haven't been keeping him from me,[br]have you?

01:23:32.91,01:23:35.03
As a matter of fact,[br]I actually hoped he might come.

01:23:35.04,01:23:37.83
Would have proved me wrong about him.

01:23:37.87,01:23:39.75
Of course, with the success of his play,

01:23:40.21,01:23:44.13
the whole of London[br]must be knocking at his door.

01:23:47.88,01:23:49.97
I'm sorry, dear.

01:23:53.89,01:23:56.89
- What is it?[br]- (Michael) It's a secret.

01:23:56.89,01:23:59.85
- (Jack) Quiet, Michael.[br]- I didn't say anything.

01:23:59.98,01:24:02.56
Mother, could you come downstairs[br]for a moment?

01:24:03.10,01:24:05.86
Oh, she can't come downstairs.[br]What are you thinking of, George?

01:24:05.90,01:24:10.44
Actually, I think a trip downstairs[br]might do her good, ma'am.

01:24:10.45,01:24:13.16
(coughs)

01:24:19.29,01:24:23.17
- (whispers) What have you been up to?[br]- (Peter) Just wait and see.

01:24:31.67,01:24:33.59
It's a play.

01:24:33.59,01:24:37.43
It's not just a play, Michael. It's the play.

01:24:38.68,01:24:41.93
Of course, we'll have to make do[br]with a few compromises.

01:24:42.69,01:24:44.69
Much of it will have to be imagined.

01:24:44.69,01:24:47.94
- (Peter) As it should be.[br]- As it should be, that's right.

01:24:55.99,01:24:59.33
(Peter) Michael, come and sit here,[br]next to Mum.

01:25:03.29,01:25:05.88
When you're ready.

01:25:05.88,01:25:08.46
(overture begins)

01:25:18.39,01:25:21.06
(laughter)

01:25:24.39,01:25:26.35
(Porthos barks, Nana growls back)

01:25:28.90,01:25:30.86
(Porthos whines)

01:25:31.78,01:25:34.36
- I won't go to bed. I won't. I won't.[br]- (Nana barks)

01:25:34.70,01:25:39.95
Nana, it isn't six o'clock yet.[br]Two minutes more. Please.

01:25:39.99,01:25:43.66
- You know fairies, Peter?[br]- Yes.

01:25:44.50,01:25:46.83
But they're nearly all dead now.

01:25:47.00,01:25:51.63
You see, Wendy, when the first baby[br]laughed for the first time,

01:25:52.00,01:25:56.05
the laugh broke into a thousand pieces[br]and they all went skipping about

01:25:56.18,01:25:58.18
and that was the beginning of fairies.

01:25:58.18,01:26:03.64
And now when every new baby is born,[br]its first laugh becomes a fairy.

01:26:03.77,01:26:07.06
So there ought to be one fairy[br]for every boy and girl.

01:26:07.27,01:26:10.36
- Ought to be? Isn't there?[br]- Oh, no.

01:26:10.40,01:26:14.94
Children know such a lot now.[br]Soon, they don't believe in fairies.

01:26:14.95,01:26:18.53
And every time a child says,[br]"I don't believe in fairies,"

01:26:18.91,01:26:22.03
there's a fairy somewhere[br]that falls down dead.

01:26:22.87,01:26:25.70
(tinkling sound)

01:26:25.71,01:26:28.75
- Who is that?[br]- (tinkling)

01:26:30.29,01:26:32.84
The redskins were defeated?

01:26:33.38,01:26:37.34
Wendy and the boys[br]captured by the pirates?

01:26:37.47,01:26:40.34
I'll rescue her. I'll rescue her!

01:26:42.47,01:26:45.27
- Oh, that's just my medicine.[br]- (tinkling)

01:26:45.68,01:26:49.65
Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?

01:26:49.77,01:26:51.56
(tinkling)

01:26:51.77,01:26:55.44
Why, Tink. You've drunk my medicine.

01:26:55.78,01:26:57.57
(tinkling)

01:26:57.57,01:27:00.53
It was poisoned.

01:27:01.57,01:27:04.83
And you drank it to save my life?

01:27:06.79,01:27:08.96
Tink.

01:27:10.29,01:27:13.13
Are you dying?

01:27:17.17,01:27:19.55
Her light is growing faint.

01:27:21.18,01:27:25.14
If it goes out, that means she's dead.

01:27:27.39,01:27:31.06
Her voice is so low I can scarcely hear[br]what she's saying.

01:27:31.06,01:27:34.73
She says she thinks[br]she could get well again

01:27:34.77,01:27:37.53
if children believed in fairies.

01:27:44.28,01:27:47.16
Do you believe in fairies?

01:27:48.70,01:27:51.96
Say quick that you believe.

01:27:54.67,01:27:57.76
If you believe, clap your hands.

01:27:59.38,01:28:02.55
Clap louder.

01:28:07.60,01:28:10.64
Thank you. Thank you.

01:28:53.89,01:28:56.56
(whispers) That is Neverland.

01:30:20.11,01:30:22.86
(James) So many perfect days.

01:30:24.07,01:30:28.66
I really began to believe[br]we'd go on like that forever.

01:30:29.07,01:30:31.24
Oh, stop it.

01:30:31.28,01:30:34.45
She wasn't going to stay with you forever.

01:30:35.29,01:30:38.71
She had a husband. My father.

01:30:38.71,01:30:42.25
She never cared for you[br]the way she did for him.

01:30:43.38,01:30:46.47
I'm not trying to replace your father, Peter.

01:30:47.01,01:30:49.84
I could never do that.

01:30:57.18,01:30:59.15
You'd best let him go.

01:31:01.90,01:31:07.03
George, would you take the boys back[br]to the house? I'll be with you in a moment.

01:31:07.40,01:31:09.45
Go on, dear.

01:31:17.00,01:31:19.04
I'm terribly sorry.

01:31:20.00,01:31:23.34
I've ruined everything I've touched[br]in this family.

01:31:23.50,01:31:26.00
Stop giving yourself so much credit.

01:31:26.01,01:31:30.26
Peter's grieving.[br]It has nothing to do with you.

01:31:31.47,01:31:33.85
Perhaps if I just had[br]a bit more time with him.

01:31:33.97,01:31:37.14
No, Mr Barrie. That won't be good enough.

01:31:37.48,01:31:43.73
If "a bit more time" is all you can provide,[br]you'd better leave him alone.

01:31:45.27,01:31:49.03
I know you don't much care for me,[br]Mrs du Maurier, and I respect that,

01:31:49.28,01:31:52.87
but I loved your daughter very much.

01:31:53.28,01:31:55.53
And I love those boys.

01:31:55.79,01:31:57.75
And I think they need me right now.

01:31:57.79,01:31:59.79
Is that so?

01:31:59.79,01:32:01.96
And for how long after?

01:32:03.29,01:32:05.17
Meaning what?

01:32:05.17,01:32:10.55
Sylvia has requested a co-guardianship[br]for the boys in her will.

01:32:10.80,01:32:15.26
You, Mr Barrie, and myself.

01:32:17.81,01:32:23.15
- And what do you have to say about that?[br]- I shall respect my daughter's wishes.

01:32:23.15,01:32:27.86
Something I should have done more of[br]while she was alive.

01:32:29.57,01:32:31.53
But if you feel you're not ready[br]for such a commitment,

01:32:31.57,01:32:36.95
I assure you I can certainly[br]look after the boys by myself.

01:32:37.08,01:32:40.16
Do you think I could abandon those boys?

01:32:49.59,01:32:51.76
Sit down, Peter.

01:33:12.07,01:33:15.53
Mother pasted it back together

01:33:15.53,01:33:17.66
after I ruined it.

01:33:18.87,01:33:20.87
And then I saw the play.

01:33:20.87,01:33:25.75
I just started writing[br]and I haven't been able to stop.

01:33:27.38,01:33:30.63
She would be very pleased to know that.

01:33:34.38,01:33:38.64
Listen. I've just spoken[br]with your grandmother

01:33:39.89,01:33:42.06
and I'm staying.

01:33:42.06,01:33:44.85
For good.

01:33:47.40,01:33:49.94
I'm sorry I was so horrible.

01:33:51.19,01:33:53.15
Don't worry.

01:33:56.70,01:33:59.66
It's just...

01:33:59.70,01:34:02.95
I thought she'd always be here.

01:34:04.87,01:34:06.83
So did I.

01:34:08.88,01:34:11.05
But, in fact...

01:34:13.67,01:34:16.09
she is.

01:34:16.09,01:34:21.26
Because she's on every page[br]of your imagination.

01:34:22.68,01:34:25.85
You'll always have her there. Always.

01:34:31.61,01:34:35.24
But why did she have to die?

01:34:42.37,01:34:44.66
I don't know, boy.

01:34:49.17,01:34:51.63
When I think of your mother...

01:34:52.67,01:34:55.63
I will always remember[br]how happy she looked

01:34:55.67,01:34:57.84
sitting there in the parlor,

01:34:57.97,01:35:00.85
watching a play about her family.

01:35:00.89,01:35:04.85
About her boys that never grew up.

01:35:08.60,01:35:11.06
She went to Neverland.

01:35:13.11,01:35:17.95
And you can visit her any time you like

01:35:18.07,01:35:20.95
if you just go there yourself.

01:35:23.08,01:35:26.08
How?

01:35:26.08,01:35:29.25
By believing, Peter.

01:35:29.25,01:35:31.54
Just believe.

01:35:44.97,01:35:47.35
(whispers) I can see her.
