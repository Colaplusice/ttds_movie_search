1
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,570
- (bell rings)
- All right, fellas, here they come.

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,530
Come on, we haven't got all night!
Let's get goin'. Move it outta here. Move!

3
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,610
Come in here!

4
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,730
They're in trouble, folks. Get these
papers while they're hot. Latest paper!

5
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,530
- Come on!
- Keep your sweatshirt on, Sidney.

6
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,450
Latest paper here!

7
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,290
Want a hot item on Hunsecker's column?
Two rolls got fresh with the baker!

8
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,530
Hey, the late paper just came in!
Who wants the late paper?

9
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,570
Just a minute, Mr Welden. I think...

10
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,650
Uh-uh.

11
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,700
I'm sorry, I thought I heard Mr Falco.

12
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,170
Yes, I'll tell him when he returns.

13
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,700
I know. He's been trying to get in touch...

14
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,250
It's the third time he's called today.

15
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,530
- Probably wants me to break a leg.
- No, an arm, he said.

16
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,210
I told him the item would be in
Mr Hunsecker's column tomorrow.

17
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,290
- It isn't.
- But...

18
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,770
I saw the early edition.

19
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,410
- But, Sidney...
- But. But, but, but what?

20
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,680
That makes five days in a row
Mr Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.

21
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,850
May I rent you out as an adding machine?
Get me Joe Robard.

22
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,130
Anybody else call?

23
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,640
The renting agent and your tailor.

24
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,850
Pay the rent and tell the tailor to wait.

25
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,640
It won't leave much balance in the bank.

26
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,290
Hello, Mr Robard?

27
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,370
Could you locate him, please?

28
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,210
Here.

29
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,450
Watch me run a 50-yard dash
with my legs cut off.

30
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,530
Hey, Joe. It's Sidney.

31
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,010
How do you like this?
I'm running outta alibis.

32
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,090
Oh, no. I asked JJ to withhold the item
until he'd give you a fat paragraph.

33
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,850
- You're a liar, Sidney.
- What do mean, "a liar"?

34
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,010
Oh, it's a publicity man's nature to be
a liar. I wouldn't hire you if you wasn't.

35
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,290
I pay you a C and a half,
where you plant big lies

36
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,370
about me and the club all over the map.

37
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,770
- If that's the way you mean it...
- Yeah, I do.

38
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,410
But also in the sense
that you are a personal liar too,

39
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,650
because you don't do the work
I pay you for.

40
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,130
When I spoke to JJ last night...

41
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,210
(Joe hangs up)

42
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,330
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.

43
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,090
You could help
with two minutes of silence.

44
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,050
I hate to see you like this.
If you feel nervous...

45
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,730
So what'll you do if I feel nervous?
Open your meaty, sympathetic arms?

46
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,770
Oh, Sidney, you got me so...
I don't know what.

47
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,250
Sally, you oughta know me by now.

48
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,610
- I know ya.
- No, you don't.

49
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,210
You think I'm a hero.

50
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,040
Well, I'm no hero. I'm nice to people
where it pays me to be nice.

51
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,530
I do it enough on the outside,
so don't expect me to do it in my office.

52
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,220
I'm in a bind right now with Hunsecker.

53
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,530
Maybe I'm dumb, but...

54
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,330
why does Mr Hunsecker wanna
squeeze your livelihood away?

55
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,560
Why do you stand for
that kind of treatment?

56
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,210
He's punishing me. His sister's
having a romance with a guitar player.

57
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:08,250
He asked me to break it up. I thought I did,
but maybe I didn't. Now I gotta go find out.

58
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,170
Hunsecker's the golden ladder
to the places I wanna get.

59
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,610
Sidney, you make a living.
Where do you wanna get?

60
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,090
Way up high, where it's always balmy.

61
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,090
Where no one says
"Hey, shrimp, rack the balls."

62
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,290
Or "Hey, mouse, go out
and buy me a pack of butts! "

63
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,010
I don't want tips from the kitty.
I'm in the big game with the big players.

64
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,730
My experience I can give you in a
nutshell, and I didn't dream it either:

65
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,930
dog eat dog. In brief, from now on, the
best of everything is good enough for me.

66
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,770
Sidney, I'm not trying
to tell you what to do.

67
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,850
It's just that it makes me feel bad
when Mr Hunsecker hurts you.

68
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,610
- (phone rings)
- Every dog will have his day.

69
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,690
If that's for me, tear it up.

70
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,090
Sidney Falco office.

71
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,690
- Take your topcoat.
- And leave a tip in every hatcheck room?

72
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,050
One, two, three, four.

73
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,970
Don't you get messages, eyelashes?
I called you twice.

74
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,050
Hey, man, I been up to here.

75
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,170
Look, you know
Susie Hunsecker? JJ's sister?

76
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,730
Has she been in? I mean lately,
in the last couple of days?

77
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,890
- I don't think so.
- Are you sure? Find out for me.

78
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,090
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?

79
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,850
- You seen Frank D'Angelo around?
- At the bar.

80
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,410
Sidney, I'm in troub...

81
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,090
- Joe! Give my nephew a drink.
- Your nephew doesn't want a drink.

82
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,570
That's a lollipop, that boy.
The kid's only great.

83
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,480
With ten percent of his future,
you're great too, Frank.

84
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,570
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.

85
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,090
Look, Sidney. You're my own sister's son,

86
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,050
but where does that give you
the right to call me a liar?

87
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,410
I thought you said your boy
was washed up with Susie Hunsecker?

88
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,890
It's the truth,
to the best of my knowledge.

89
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,370
Frankly, I'm glad.
For Steve's sake, not yours.

90
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,810
I handle these boys with
their best interests at heart.

91
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,050
Steve shouldn't get mixed up
with no bimbo at his age.

92
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,330
Listen, Frank.
You better be tellin' me the truth.

93
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,490
I don't like this threatening attitude.
I told you what I know.

94
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,240
And what business is it of yours
what they do, this boy and girl...

95
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,730
(whispers)

96
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,450
If you knew Hunsecker like I do, you
might understand why it is my business.

97
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,530
You're walking around blind,
Frank, without a cane.

98
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,490
And in case you didn't know it, Susie
Hunsecker's out the back right now.

99
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,370
(applause)

100
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,850
Thank you very much
on behalf of the Quintet -

101
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,570
Chico Hamilton, Fred Katz,
Paul Horn, Carson Smith and myself.

102
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,890
- Hi, Susan.
- Hello, Chico.

103
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,370
Hey, Paul, cool this chick here
while I go get Steve.

104
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,490
It's an interesting fusion
of traditional and progressive.

105
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,890
- How did you come to form the group?
- We just sort of got together.

106
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,130
Why don't you ask Fred Katz?
He writes all the stuff.

107
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,090
Mr Katz, I'm very interested
in music, in jazz...

108
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,730
What's the answer?

109
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,530
Steve...

110
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,640
I'll try to make you a good wife.

111
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,370
- Where's the cat?
- Who?

112
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,800
Dallas. Is he around?

113
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,210
He's around somewhere. Upstairs, maybe.

114
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,970
Thank you.

115
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,490
Look, let's go out later.
Come on. I'll get the boys.

116
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,690
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything
to anybody until I tell my brother.

117
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,610
You haven't told him yet?

118
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,330
I'm telling him
in the morning at breakfast.

119
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,850
Susie, don't you want me
to be with you when you tell him?

120
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,610
My brother isn't as bad as
he's painted. He's not perfect...

121
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,440
But he isn't gonna like this.
And he makes you nervous, not me.

122
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,570
I take that back.
He makes me nervous too.

123
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,370
Steve, let's don't talk about my brother.

124
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,450
I've missed you the last few days.

125
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,530
I have a message for you.

126
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,090
I love you.

127
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,690
May I dedicate the next number
to you, and the next, and the next...

128
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,850
- Every Sunday I'll buy you a bonnet.
- If the stores are open.

129
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,850
On Monday, I'll take it off
and stroke your hair.

130
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,410
And on Tuesday, hasenpfeffer?

131
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,250
(Steve) You know how
I realised I loved you?

132
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,650
(Susie) I made you write a beautiful song?

133
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,370
You had me eating that Chinese food!

134
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,050
Hi. Can more than two enjoy this?

135
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,850
Where are those prints you promised me?
I can't place them after tonight.

136
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,690
Thanks very much just the same.
Let's forget about it.

137
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,850
Come on, Susie, it's cold out here.

138
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:46,360
I apologise for getting you a press spread!
It's been an honour serving you gratis.

139
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,690
Falco, I get the feeling
you're always snooping around.

140
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,520
- Boys, what are you fightin' about?
- Kill me. Push me through a window.

141
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,200
I walked into this hallowed
ground without knocking.

142
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,450
I feel too good to fight with you,
but that isn't what I said. I said you snoop.

143
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,880
What were you doing at
my hotel the other night?

144
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,410
- I haven't been in the Bowery in years.
- Come on, boys. Break it up.

145
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,810
When you want information,
don't scratch for it like a dog.

146
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,530
Just ask for it like a man.

147
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,570
If you're going home,
Susie, I'll drop you off.

148
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,200
Steve, it's time for us to hit it again.

149
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,720
- In a minute, Chico.
- OK.

150
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,290
- Headache?
- It's all the excitement.

151
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,530
I'll go home and go to bed early,
and you go to work.

152
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,250
OK. Just don't leave me in a minor key.

153
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,210
You haven't been playing
around with Leo Bartha?

154
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,490
No. That's what I mean.
I'm bein' fired for what I didn't do.

155
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,330
He came in last week
on a real dull, rainy night.

156
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,130
I knew who he was, but I didn't let on.
He kept starin' at me all night.

157
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,690
- Are you listening?
- Avidly.

158
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,610
- He was staring.
- Starin'.

159
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,650
So when he approached me
on his way out, I wasn't surprised.

160
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,480
- He was doing a Sunday piece on...
- Cigarette girls. Naturally...

161
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,180
You were thrilled
about being interviewed.

162
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,410
And were you "interviewed"?

163
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,970
In his apartment.

164
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,090
- Where was his wife?
- I don't know. It's a big apartment.

165
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,690
Only I wasn't interviewed. In fact, I was
totally unprepared for what happened.

166
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,610
Oh, come on, chickie.
We're friends from way back.

167
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,130
A columnist without his ball and chain,
you make like a delicatessen counter...

168
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,450
What did you expect
he'd do in his apartment!

169
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,250
But, Sidney, sweetheart.
The man must have been out of his mind.

170
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,840
It was only 1 1 o'clock in the morning.

171
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,770
I was so taken aback, I said anything
that popped into my sleepy head.

172
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,410
If I'm not mistaken, I think I even
ordered the man out of his own house.

173
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,450
He was furious. By the time I could've
been put in a tropical-island mood,

174
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,370
I was out on the street.

175
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,800
That night, Van Cleve
calls me into his office.

176
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,290
He's got nothin' against me, he says, only
he can't afford to antagonise columnists.

177
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,330
So I tell him how I still have Sonny
at the military academy...

178
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,210
- Could you do something?
- That's what I'm thinkin', Rita. Maybe.

179
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,290
Sidney, do you still keep
your key under the mat?

180
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,850
Can you be there at 2.30?

181
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,250
You're touchy, Sidney.
Don't be so touchy.

182
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,930
Do a guy a favour.
Well, live and learn.

183
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,010
- You want something to eat?
- No, no.

184
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,370
161 9 Broadway.

185
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,140
I wish you and Steve
could like each other.

186
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,480
We stick in each other's craw.

187
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,570
Yes, but why?

188
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,930
For one thing, he thinks
JJ is some kind of a monster.

189
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,210
Don't you?

190
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,010
Susie, JJ happens to be
one of my very best friends.

191
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,250
I know. But I'd like to look
into your clever little mind

192
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,330
and see what you really think of him.

193
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,020
- Why make that remark?
- Who could love a man

194
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,130
who makes you jump through
burning hoops like a trained poodle?

195
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,210
Do you think JJ really likes Steve?

196
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,010
Frankly, yes. Much to my surprise.

197
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,330
He thinks he's a big talent.
Those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.

198
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,210
You feel pretty strong
about Dallas, don't you?

199
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,850
Yes.

200
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,570
- Wedding bells?
- I'm discussing it with JJ in the morning.

201
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,530
Makes me feel good to know that
some people want me for myself.

202
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,650
- Not just because I'm my brother's sister.
- I'm gonna have to laugh at that.

203
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,730
An attractive girl like you.

204
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,450
I hope JJ likes Steve,
that he isn't just putting on an act.

205
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,490
Why should he put on an act for him?

206
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,850
He's told presidents
where to go and what to do.

207
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,810
The act would be for my sake.

208
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,250
Not for Steve's.

209
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,290
Wait for me. I'll be back in a minute.

210
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,570
Susie.

211
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,650
I wanna talk to you a minute.

212
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,810
Susie, don't sell your brother short.

213
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,610
Talk this over with him.
You'll find him a real friend.

214
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,960
In case I see JJ, any message?

215
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:19,490
Tell him from me that Steve is the first
real man I've ever been in love with.

216
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,530
21 .

217
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,730
- Excuse me.
- Hey, wait... Jimmy, what a coincidence!

218
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,050
Yeah, a coincidence running into
the very man you been ducking all week.

219
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,530
- This is my press agent, Joan.
- I tried to call you twice, but...

220
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,370
What do ya do for that 100 a week?
Fall outta bed?

221
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,690
I was on my way
to talk to Hunsecker. I got...

222
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,770
- I'll have this kid arrested for larceny.
- When the band was at Roseland...

223
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,050
That was two months ago. Take
your hands outta my pocket, thief.

224
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,130
- Jimmy, now take it easy.
- Why?

225
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,610
It's a dirty job, but I pay
clean money for it.

226
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,360
No more, you don't. What is this,
showin' off for the girl?

227
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,850
He's clever.
He knows when he's bein' fired.

228
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,090
If you're funny, James,
I'm a pretzel. Drop dead.

229
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,120
- How are you tonight, Mr Falco?
- Fine. Is he here?

230
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,370
- Of course.
- Alone or surrounded?

231
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,450
A senator, an agent
and a thing with blonde, wavy hair.

232
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,690
Good evening.

233
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,730
- Honey, get me Mr Hunsecker.
- Oh, he's right inside.

234
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,810
So it isn't long-distance.

235
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,450
- Hello?
- JJ, it's Sidney.

236
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,360
- Could you come out for a minute?
- Could I come out? No.

237
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,090
I have to talk to you, JJ. That's why.

238
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,330
You had to do something for me.
You didn't do it.

239
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:20,450
- Could I come in for a minute?
- No. You're dead. Get yourself buried.

240
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,530
(hangs up)

241
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,090
Just a moment. I'm ringing.

242
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,420
He doesn't answer.
Shall I take a message?

243
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,530
- Oh, uh, Sidney?
- Later.

244
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,040
I often wish I were deaf
and wore a hearing aid.

245
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,130
With a flick of the switch, I could
shut out the greedy murmur of little men.

246
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,960
- JJ, I need your ear for two minutes.
- Mac, I don't want this man at my table.

247
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,530
I've got a message from your sister.

248
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,450
- Forgive me. We were interrupted.
- The Supreme Court story. Justice Black.

249
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,450
Oh, yes. Justice Black.

250
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,730
- I believe I had it in my column.
- Last July. The lead item.

251
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,010
I believe that's where I read it too.

252
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,250
See where I get my reputation for being
the best-informed man in Washington?

253
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,330
Now don't kid a kidder.

254
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,530
I don't think we caught
your name, young man.

255
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,890
Sidney Falco, sir. But everybody
knows and admires you, Senator Walker.

256
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,010
Every six years
I become less convinced of that.

257
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,050
This young lady is Miss Linda James.
She's managed by Manny Davis.

258
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,290
- I know Manny Davis.
- Everyone knows Manny Davis.

259
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,050
(phone buzzes)

260
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,130
Except Mrs Manny Davis.

261
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,530
(JJ) Go ahead, Billy. Shoot.

262
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,730
Sports cars are getting
smaller and smaller in California.

263
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,930
You were crossing Hollywood Boulevard
and you got hit by one.

264
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,370
And you had to go
to the hospital to get it removed.

265
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,690
(Manny laughs)

266
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,810
Billy, you're not following
the column. I had it last week.

267
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,930
Senator, do you believe
in capital punishment?

268
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,010
- Why?
- A man has just been sentenced to death.

269
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,170
Manny, tell me,

270
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:28,010
what exactly are the unseen gifts of
this lovely young thing that you manage?

271
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,850
Well, she sings a little.
You know, she sings and...

272
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,930
Manny's faith in me is simply
awe-inspiring, Mr Hunsecker.

273
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,810
- Actually, I'm still studying.
- What subject?

274
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,930
Singing, of course. Straight concert and...

275
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:47,210
Why "of course"? You might,
for instance, be studying politics.

276
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,690
- Uh, me?
- Well, you see, JJ...

277
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,410
I mean, I? You must be
kidding, Mr Hunsecker.

278
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,410
Me, with my Jersey City brains?

279
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,010
The brains may be Jersey City,

280
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,600
but the clothes are Traina Norell.

281
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,170
Are you an actor, Mr Falco?

282
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,770
That's what I was thinking.
Are you, Mr Falco?

283
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,530
How did you guess it, Miss James?

284
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,930
He's so pretty, that's how.

285
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:15,930
Mr Falco, let it be said at once,
is a man of 40 faces, not one.

286
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,810
None too pretty, and all deceptive.

287
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,090
You see that grin? That's the, uh...

288
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,280
That's the "charming street urchin" face.

289
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,770
It's part of his helpless act.
He throws himself upon your mercy.

290
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,050
He's got a half dozen faces for the ladies.

291
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,410
But the one I like, the really cute one,
is the "quick, dependable chap".

292
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:39,160
Nothing he won't do for you in a pinch.
So he says.

293
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,570
Mr Falco, whom I did not invite to sit at
this table tonight, is a hungry press agent

294
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,320
and fully up to all the tricks
of his very slimy trade.

295
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,170
Match me, Sidney.

296
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,210
Not right this minute, JJ.

297
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,530
I know, your wonder boy
is opening at the Latin Quarter.

298
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,610
- JJ...
- Say goodbye, Lester.

299
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,770
May I ask you a naive question, Mr Falco?

300
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,010
Exactly how does a press agent work?

301
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,890
Uh...

302
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,370
Answer the man, Sidney.
He's trying to take you off the hook.

303
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,930
You just saw a good
example of it, Senator.

304
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,650
A press agent eats a columnist's dirt
and is expected to call it manna.

305
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,690
Don't you help columnists
by furnishing them with items?

306
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,970
Sure. The columnists can't do without us,

307
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,480
except our friend JJ
forgets to mention that.

308
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,920
You see, we furnish him with items.

309
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,690
- Want some cheap, gruesome gags?
- You print 'em.

310
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,930
Yes, with your clients' names attached.

311
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:47,130
That's the only reason the poor slobs pay
you, to see their names in my column.

312
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,290
Now I make it out
you're doing me a favour?

313
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,330
The day I can't get along
without a press agent's handouts,

314
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,730
I'll close up shop and move
to Alaska, lock, stock and barrel.

315
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,610
Sweep out my igloo, here I come.

316
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,850
You rode in on the Senator's
shirt-tails, so shut your mouth.

317
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,490
Now, come, JJ. That's a little too harsh.

318
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,240
Anyone seems fair game for you tonight.

319
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,610
This man is not for you, Harvey. And you
shouldn't be seen in public with him.

320
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,250
Because that's another part
of a press agent's life.

321
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:19,090
They dig up scandal about prominent
people and spread it among columnists.

322
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,450
There seems to be some allusion
here that escapes me.

323
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:28,300
We're friends, Harvey. We go back to
when you were a fresh-kid congressman.

324
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,690
Why is it that everything
you say sounds like a threat?

325
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,610
Maybe it's a mannerism.
I don't threaten friends.

326
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,300
But why furnish your
enemies with ammunition?

327
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,530
You're a family man, Harvey. Some day,
God willing, you may wanna be president.

328
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:45,770
And here you are, out in the open,
where any hep person knows

329
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,520
that this one...
is toting that one around for you.

330
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,770
Are we kids or what?

331
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,690
Next time you come up,
you might join me on my TV show.

332
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,610
Thanks, JJ, for what
I consider sound advice.

333
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,570
Go, thou, and sin no more.

334
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,730
- Senator.
- Goodbye, Mr Falco.

335
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,890
- Don't let the Senator pay that check.
- I'll take care of it.

336
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,730
President! My big toe
would make a better president.

337
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,010
- Mr Hunsecker's coat, Joe.
- Pick me a good one, Joe.

338
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,090
Thanks, Al.

339
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,090
Anyone calls, Dan, I'll be at El Morocco.

340
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,680
Where's your coat, Sidney? Saving tips?

341
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,010
My curiosity's killing me, but what
are you so rambunctious about tonight?

342
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,010
There's your fat friend.

343
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,570
(car radio)
Police car, 1 6th precinct. Attention.

344
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,930
- Hello, Harry.
- Buona sera. Come sta?

345
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,290
Italian, Sidney. That shows
Lieutenant Kello likes your people.

346
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,610
It's my Brooklyn background, JJ.
Good with Yiddish, too.

347
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,090
Harry! Am I supposed to say "Uncle"?

348
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,370
- Hello, Phil. How's the kids?
- Just great, Mr Hunsecker.

349
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,800
- Anything fit for me to print tonight?
- Nah.

350
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,690
I just checked downtown.
It's quiet everywhere.

351
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,450
What happened to that doll?
She still alive?

352
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,890
Yeah. She's hanging on.
We still don't know if she was pushed.

353
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,170
- Maybe she jumped? Love suicide.
- Could be.

354
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,370
Check that, will ya, Phil?
It's a real heartthrob.

355
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,970
Harry, say hello to Sidney Falco.
Tickle him. He's been a bad boy tonight.

356
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,400
He called you my "fat friend."

357
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,850
- I don't believe it.
- I know! The strongest cop in town.

358
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,090
(Harry laughs)

359
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,810
I call him "the boy
with the ice-cream face".

360
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,290
That's good. In fact, it's apt, Harry.

361
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,130
Yeah, I got eyes. I put things together.

362
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,690
I remember once when you didn't
quite put things together.

363
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,170
Boy, was the mayor mad.

364
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,890
Citizens' committee.
I didn't mean to hit the boy so hard.

365
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,850
That's when a fella needed a friend.
I won't forget his initials, JJ.

366
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,290
Mr Hunsecker!
She died 20 minutes ago.

367
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,650
That's show business. Thanks, Phil.

368
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,730
See you, Harry.

369
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,130
See ya, Kello.

370
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,490
Hasta la vista, JJ.
Hasta luego.

371
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,610
Spanish. That shows
he likes the spics, too, huh?

372
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,850
I like Harry, but I can't
deny he sweats a little.

373
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,970
(bouncer) Don't try to come back!

374
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,770
(drunk man) Just a minute!
My hat's in there and I paid you.

375
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,850
(woman) Leave him alone!

376
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,770
I love this dirty town.

377
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,930
Sidney. Conjugate me a verb.

378
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,010
For instance, "to promise".

379
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,490
You promised to break up
that romance. When?

380
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,970
- I doubt if you know what it involves.
- I'm a schoolboy. Teach me.

381
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,690
You break it up. You know
you can do it in two minutes.

382
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,380
At this late date you need explanations?

383
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,960
Susie's all I've got. Now she's growing up,

384
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,410
I want my relationship with her
to remain at least at par.

385
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:24,410
I don't intend to do anything
to antagonise her if I don't have to.

386
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,250
Be warned, son. I'll have to blitz you.

387
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,940
Frankly, I don't think
you got the cards to blitz me.

388
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,490
- I don't?
- I don't think so.

389
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,570
I'll listen for one more minute.

390
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,250
A year ago, I did you a certain favour.

391
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,290
It was a thing... I never did
such a dirty thing in my life.

392
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,810
All right, it's forgotten.
Which brings us up to five weeks ago.

393
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,450
"Sidney, I got a nasty problem.
Do so-and-so and I'll appreciate it."

394
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,360
Did I say no? I'm the first to admit
it didn't jell as fast as we'd like.

395
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,210
But why, all of a sudden,
can't I get you on the phone?

396
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,290
And why am I frozen out of the column?

397
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,250
- You finished?
- No. Let me finish.

398
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,330
I don't like this job.
That boy is dumb on matine days only.

399
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,770
Otherwise he's got a head.
Susan is growing up-two heads.

400
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,090
We got a slippery,
dangerous problem here.

401
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,650
- Not "we", Sidney. You.
- Correct me if I'm wrong. We.

402
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,730
If I'm gonna go out on a limb for you,
you gotta know what's involved.

403
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,290
My right hand hasn't seen
my left hand in 30 years.

404
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,960
I'll do it, JJ. Don't get me wrong.
I'll go through with it.

405
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,900
But stop beating me on the head.
Let me make a living!

406
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,170
Sidney, what you promised, do it.
Don't finagle around.

407
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,090
It's later than you think.

408
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:33,690
Excuse me, JJ. It's later than you think.
That boy proposed to her.

409
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,410
Susie told you that?

410
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,210
Uh-huh.

411
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:48,210
- What was her answer?
- She'll discuss it with you at breakfast.

412
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,730
That means you've got a plan.
Can you deliver?

413
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:58,370
Tonight. Before you go to bed.
Cat's in the bag and the bag's in the river.

414
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,890
Don't be a two-time loser, Sidney.
The penalty could be severe.

415
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,850
Good evening, Mr Falco.

416
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,410
- Hi, Harry. You seen Bartha?
- Yeah, he's around here someplace.

417
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,130
- Hiya, Sid. Want a table?
- No. Leo Bartha been in?

418
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:42,490
Yeah. He's having' supper with the Mrs.
She's over there and he's...

419
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,570
Oh. I see him. Thanks.

420
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,200
Hello, Leo. How goes
the Sunday piece on cigarette girls?

421
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:55,570
- Who told you about it?
- The cigarette girl. Rita.

422
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,450
And she took out all her hairpins, too.

423
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,730
I never had the pleasure of meeting
your wife. You know what I wonder, Leo?

424
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,450
Maybe you can use a hot item
for tomorrow's column?

425
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,960
What is this? Blackmail?

426
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,050
Beat it.

427
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,690
Leo, I've never had the pleasure
of meeting your wife.

428
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,810
- Sidney Falco, Loretta.
- How do you do, Mr Falco?

429
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,050
If you know about the horses, sit down.

430
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,740
Have a glass of this
New York State champagne.

431
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:41,130
- That's what my husband buys me.
- Imported wines aren't that great.

432
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,090
Who's side are you on? His or mine?

433
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,290
Frankly, I'm a neutral observer
for the United Nations.

434
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,370
- What's your first name?
- Sidney.

435
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,770
- No horse running by that name.
- Why don't you stop these $2 bets?

436
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,970
It's compensation, Leo,
for the marginal life we lead.

437
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,090
Sidney, did you hear
about the cloak-and...

438
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,170
You tell him and I read it
in Hunsecker's column first.

439
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,250
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?

440
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,610
No. I actually sat down
to give Leo an item.

441
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,330
Leo, he wants to give you
an item. Don't be sullen.

442
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,410
- Would you mind your own business?
- Hitler.

443
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,050
In case you wanna use it,
it's a blind. No names mentioned.

444
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,050
For your private information,
the guy's name is Dallas.

445
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,720
There's not a single name here
that gives off vibrations.

446
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,410
Is there anything with a name
like Cigarette Girl?

447
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:39,930
Cigarette Girl. No.
There's no name here like that.

448
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,130
- I don't print blind items.
- What is this? Chess or checkers?

449
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,970
Neither does Hunsecker.
He likes to use the real names.

450
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,610
- Waiter, the check!
- (Loretta) Why are we running?

451
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,120
This man is trying
to hold a gun to my head.

452
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,640
That's the horse. Shotgun, in the fifth.

453
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,290
You wanna tell my wife something?
What, Sidney?

454
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,410
- That you spilled champagne over me.
- Go on, tell her.

455
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,000
What are ya gettin' excited
about? Calm down.

456
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,330
Sorry, Lorrie. I can't let
this man blackmail me.

457
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,450
Blackmail?

458
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,490
He wants me to print
a dirty little smear item,

459
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,890
in exchange for keeping his mouth shut.

460
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,970
About what?

461
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,650
Foolishly, Lorrie...
I hope you'll understand...

462
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:37,370
This cigarette girl. I was kidding
around. With the girl, I mean.

463
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,610
I was kidding, she took it seriously.

464
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:46,210
A case of bad judgment. Bad taste.

465
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,210
I'm just sorry. That's all.

466
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,810
Your friend, Hunsecker.

467
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,170
You tell him for me
he's a disgrace to his profession.

468
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,650
Never mind about my bilious private life.

469
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,010
I run a decent, responsible column.
That's the way it stays.

470
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,610
Your man prints anything! Use any
spice to pepper up his daily garbage.

471
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,650
You tell him I said so.

472
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,130
Tell him that, like yourself,
he's got the scruples of a guinea pig

473
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,130
and the morals of a gangster.

474
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,210
What do I do now?
Whistle "Stars and Stripes Forever"?

475
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,290
What you do now, Mr Falco,
is crow like a hen.

476
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,050
You have just laid an egg.

477
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:29,850
Leo, this is the first clean thing
I've seen you do in years.

478
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,160
Mr Elwell wants to see you, Mr Falco.

479
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,890
I see Bartha gave you
cold tongue for supper.

480
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,490
- I got a date with a dame.
- Hey!

481
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:14,730
Look, Otis, if you're trying to blow this
into an item for your column, forget it.

482
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:18,530
By the way, what's this I hear about
JJ giving you the flit-gun treatment?

483
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,090
He shut you out of his column.

484
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,290
Why?

485
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,090
You don't know that lunatic yet?
Whims, whims. Egotistic whims.

486
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,210
He's like the gag-you got him for
a friend, you don't need an enemy.

487
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,650
That's what my beef with Leo Bartha was
about. "Leo," I says, "JJ froze me out."

488
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,400
"So I'm eating humble pie this month.
Please, please print me an item."

489
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,690
Instead he printed his heel
on your face, huh?

490
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,730
- You're full of human feelings.
- Turn the record over.

491
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,160
Like most of the human race, I'm bored.

492
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,410
I'd go a mile for a... chuckle.

493
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,810
Or two miles for a pretty girl.

494
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,610
Three.

495
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,970
Then you're really washed up
with Hunsecker, huh?

496
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,930
This is how much
I'm washed up with Hunsecker.

497
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,250
Look, Otis. I make no brief
about my bilious private life,

498
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:28,370
but he's got the morals of a guinea pig
and the scruples of a gangster.

499
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,010
A fine, fat, dirty item.

500
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,090
Who's it about?

501
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,330
Um, a kid named Dallas.
He runs a dinky jazz quintet.

502
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,090
But he happens to be keeping
company with JJ's screwball sister.

503
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:47,680
It's a real goody, if, like me,
you wanna clobber JJ.

504
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,330
He's got his TV tomorrow.
He'd read it before rehearsals.

505
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,530
I want to clobber JJ.

506
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,890
But I can't think of a good reason why
I should print anything you give me.

507
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,370
I can't even think of a bad reason.

508
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,850
Suppose I introduce you
to a... lovely reason?

509
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,410
It's both good and bad...

510
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,490
and available.

511
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,130
I'm not an unreasonable man.

512
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,250
(buzzer)

513
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,370
Hi.

514
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,490
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.

515
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,690
- Hello.
- Hello!

516
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:06,760
My friends call me Otis.
Sometimes Tricky Otis.

517
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,050
Otis was outraged when I told him
Van Cleve was gonna fire you.

518
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,690
- He... He was?
- Mm-hm.

519
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:17,330
- Don't I know you from somewhere?
- (Sidney) Otis.

520
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,610
Saratoga. Last summer?

521
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,810
Relax, relax. Come on, take
the weight off those lovely gams, huh?

522
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,530
Look, I fixed you a drink.

523
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,010
Sure, relax, Rita.

524
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,570
When you look at me,
you look at a friend in disguise.

525
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,450
Miami Beach?

526
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,570
Haven't been to Florida
since I was a little girl.

527
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:52,170
Well, here's to the time when we played
with dolls and dreamed of better things.

528
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,450
Here, Otis.

529
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:58,330
- A cosy place you've got here, Sidney.
- Make yourself at home.

530
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,130
Nice, nice.

531
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,770
And snug.

532
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,170
Otis carries a lot
of weight with your boss.

533
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,810
He's gonna tell him to ignore anything

534
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,650
you-know-who says
about you-know what.

535
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,050
- Right, Otis?
- Right.

536
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,850
Why don't you two
talk it over until I get back?

537
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,130
- Back?
- These business meetings.

538
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,890
Always coming up
in the middle of the night.

539
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,130
Hold on! You can drop me off
on your way.

540
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,890
- Consternation reigns.
- Now, Otis...

541
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,530
I hate JJ, but not that much
at this moment.

542
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,170
Look, give me a chance, huh?

543
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,000
- Don't you know who that man is?
- Yeah!

544
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,890
- Otis Elwell, the columnist.
- Yeah.

545
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,170
And he's a perfect stranger to me.

546
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,650
So take five minutes.
Get acquainted.

547
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:03,690
He's an important man.
He's lonely. Don't be dumb.

548
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,610
What do you want all of a sudden?
Lady Godiva?

549
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,250
Where's my other shoe?

550
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,930
- What kind of an act is this?
- Don't you think I have any feelings?

551
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,130
What am I? A bowl of fruit?
A tangerine that peels in a minute?

552
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,770
I beg your pardon.
How do you like this!

553
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,520
I turn myself inside out
to do you a favour, now I'm the heavy!

554
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,650
Here's your shoe. There's your coat.

555
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,850
And there's the door.

556
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,890
Sidney, I don't do this sorta thing.

557
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,770
- What sorta thing?
- This sorta thing!

558
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,130
You need him for a favour, don't you?

559
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,930
Well, so do I. I need his column tonight.

560
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,530
Didn't you ask me
to do something about your job?

561
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,170
Don't you have a kid in military school?

562
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,290
You're a snake, Falco.

563
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,210
You're a louse. A real louse.

564
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,290
Honey, he's gonna help you!

565
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,370
Huh?

566
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,610
How many drinks does it take...
to put you in that tropical-island mood?

567
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,620
Havana, that's where we met.

568
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,490
Here's mud in your column.

569
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,650
Blessings on thee, the both.

570
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,210
Well, gotta run. See you kids later.

571
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,490
Hurry back.

572
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,730
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
And that gives you a lotta leeway.

573
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,050
Palm Springs.

574
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,610
Two years ago.

575
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,930
Don't tell Sidney.

576
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,410
(phone rings)

577
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,250
(ringing continues)

578
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,250
Hello, JJ? Sidney.

579
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,330
JJ?

580
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,410
Yes, Sidney?
You sound happy, Sidney.

581
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,840
Why should you be happy when I'm not?

582
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:20,360
How do you spell "Picasso"?
One s or two?

583
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,450
Two.

584
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:27,170
- An item. He dates three-eyed girls.
- It'd be nice if you'd mention R-o-b-a-r-d.

585
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,010
Robard's jazz joint.
It's his 20th anniversary.

586
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,370
Don't begrudge it to me, JJ.
I owe him a lot of favours.

587
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:38,250
I think you understand
that the Dallas skull is badly dented.

588
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,210
Oh, yeah. Very bad.

589
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,410
Starting today, you can play
marbles with his eyeballs.

590
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,610
Now don't begrudge it to me, JJ.
Mention Robard...

591
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,300
We shall see what we shall see, Sidney.

592
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,770
And, Sidney, don't use
this phone any more.

593
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,890
I have a nervous sister.

594
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,450
Get your paper here!

595
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,850
- Record.
- Thank you.

596
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,330
Get your paper here! Read all about it!

597
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:03,130
I have no power to retract, Mr Cummings.
I'm only Mr Hunsecker's secretary.

598
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:08,730
No. Nor do I agree that any retraction
is necessary. Thank you for calling.

599
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,300
I fail to see what's amusing
about these papers.

600
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,290
- I'll get the boss to sign them.
- They're important.

601
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,570
You've said that six times.
That's why I'm smiling.

602
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,290
Hello, Mary, my darling.
What are you up to today?

603
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,250
That's a question I usually like to ask you.

604
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,130
- Your secretary phoned.
- About what?

605
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:33,690
Something about a Frank D'Angelo
trying to reach you.

606
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,770
Is, um... that the man
who manages Susie's boyfriend?

607
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,690
- Mm-hm.
- Have you seen this?

608
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,770
Otis Elwell's column today?

609
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,890
"The dreamy marijuana smoke of a lad
who heads a highbrow jazz quintet

610
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:52,530
is giving an inelegant odour to that
elegant East Side club where he works."

611
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,130
"That's no way for
a card-holding party member to act."

612
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:59,170
"Moscow won't like it,
you naughty boy."

613
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:04,400
- Sidney Falco office.
- Hello, Sally. I got your message.

614
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,370
If D'Angelo calls, tell him
I'll be at the office around noon. Bye.

615
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,610
- Could this be that boy?
- Dallas? Could be.

616
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:17,250
- Doesn't look like a flier to me.
- If it's true, JJ's gonna hit the ceiling.

617
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:22,130
Can it be news to you that JJ's ceiling
needs a new plaster job every six weeks?

618
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,330
Sidney.

619
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,650
JJ doesn't like people to look
at the column proof in advance.

620
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:34,170
Mary, I'm not people. There's Falco
blood, sweat and tears in that column.

621
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,290
How about dinner tonight?

622
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,530
Bribing me again?

623
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:42,050
Why should I bribe the woman
that holds most of my heart?

624
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,850
You're a real rascal, Sidney.

625
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:51,130
An amusing boy, but you haven't got
a drop of respect in you for anything alive.

626
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:55,770
You're so immersed in
a theology of making a fast buck.

627
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,890
Not that I don't sometimes feel
that you yearn for something better.

628
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:07,050
Don't try and sell me the Brooklyn Bridge.
I know it belongs to the Dodgers.

629
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:12,370
Oh, I don't mind you seeing the column
in advance, so long as JJ doesn't know.

630
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,490
But don't do it like a little boy
stealing gum from a slot machine.

631
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:25,970
Who put this item in about the comic?

632
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,450
"If there's a more hilarious man
than Herbie Temple at the Palace,

633
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:33,770
pardon us for not catching the name.
We were too busy screaming."

634
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,570
- Does this Temple have a press agent?
- No.

635
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,650
It's one of JJ's occasional beaux gestes.

636
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,850
Evidently the fellow's funny,
so he gave him a plug.

637
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:46,130
What's your favourite ribbon
for your favourite chocolate?

638
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:49,650
Let's wait till Christmas.
It's more legitimate then.

639
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,090
- Hey!
- Herbie Temple on stage yet?

640
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,850
Yeah, but you can't go in there now.

641
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,970
I said "Figo, I'm not
selling ya a dozen eggs."

642
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:09,490
"I'm selling ya Herbie Temple,
so don't gimme any of your lip."

643
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:14,370
- Hi, Al.
- Since when did you two get acquainted?

644
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,650
- How do you do, Mr Temple?
- D-d-delighted.

645
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,450
- I'm Sidney Falco.
- Oh, d-d-d I'm glad to know you.

646
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,210
Watch out for this guy.
He's a press agent.

647
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:25,130
You watch out for him, Al. I stutter.

648
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:29,290
- I caught your act the other night...
- On the first or the second bounce?

649
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,930
- I thought you were great.
- Well, that's fine.

650
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,170
What time is it, Al?

651
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,490
You got ten minutes yet.

652
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,080
I hate to bother you, but we're kinda busy.

653
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,370
It's all right. A little busy myself.

654
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,210
I'm busy, too. Don't call us, we'll call you.

655
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:47,970
May I ask an impertinent question,
with no criticism intended?

656
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:54,730
but how can you let a sock act like Herbie
tiptoe along without a publicity build?

657
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:57,210
We're not buyin' it, Falco.
No fish today.

658
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:59,370
I'm not selling any. I'm just curious.

659
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,690
Answer his question fast
before he asks you five more.

660
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:06,440
Mr Temple don't believe in press agents.
Does that answer ya something?

661
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,850
Take your hands off me, lump.

662
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,650
Look, nobody believes
in a press agent, Temple,

663
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,340
if he makes claims he can't produce.

664
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:17,970
I'm not here to sell anything
and I'm not gonna peddle anything.

665
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:23,530
But when I tell a client I can
get him space in Hunsecker's column,

666
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,930
it's not talk.

667
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,050
Excuse me.

668
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,730
- Listen, you bull artist, if you think...
- Let him alone, Al.

669
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,840
(phone rings)

670
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:39,570
- Hello, Sidney...
- Hello, Mary. Could I talk to JJ?

671
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:43,210
Now, look. Nobody hired you.
We didn't talk any deal.

672
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:47,120
Relax, lump. I told you,
I wasn't peddling any fish today.

673
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:50,730
JJ, hi. Sidney Falco.
How are you, sweetheart?

674
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,290
Fine. Just fine, thanks.

675
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:58,570
Look, I know it's late, but is it too late
to add something to your column?

676
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,330
No, no. No relative, but very important.

677
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,530
If you got some paper and a pencil,
I can suggest a word or two. Good.

678
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:14,330
"If there's a more hilarious man around
than, uh... Herbie Temple at the Palace,

679
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:20,370
you'll, uh... pardon us for not catching
his name. We were too busy laughing."

680
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,770
No, make that "We were
too busy screaming."

681
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,930
Right. Thanks, JJ.
Probably see ya at 21 later.

682
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,930
No, supper. Right.
Goodbye and thanks again.

683
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,370
Speak to the man, Al.

684
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,290
Wait a minute. Hold it, will ya?

685
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,210
Al, speak to Mr Falco.

686
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:42,330
- See me in my office.
- Al makes all the deals, doc.

687
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,610
I don't like a fella so quick with his hands.

688
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:48,210
Temple, you've been three
passes behind for the last 20 years.

689
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:51,770
This could start you off real big.
TV, movies... anywhere.

690
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,570
- Probably cost us a pretty penny, too?
- You tell him. I st-st-stutter.

691
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,080
Look, why don't we wait until tomorrow?

692
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,770
Wait as long as you like.

693
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,850
You know where my office is.

694
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,490
(D'Angelo) Take it easy, Steve.

695
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,410
Hi.

696
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,970
What is here? A wake?

697
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,730
- You read as you run, don't you?
- It's a habit with me.

698
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,930
So now I'm briefed. So what?

699
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:44,340
- Frank thought I shouldn't come...
- Excuse me.

700
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:49,210
I said you shouldn't go around wild,
blaming people without justification.

701
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:55,210
I thought you might have
a faint idea how that item originated.

702
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,050
- Why me?
- Why not you?

703
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,850
Wha... Oh, that's your idea of logic, huh?

704
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,130
I say to the judge
"I didn't murder the man",

705
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,250
but the judge says to me "Why not you? "

706
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,410
There's only two men who
could be responsible for that smear:

707
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,730
you or Hunsecker, or both.

708
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:13,240
Hunsecker and Elwell
are enemies to the knife.

709
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,250
- How do you get him doing JJ a favour?
- It is a favour, isn't it?

710
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:20,690
Dallas, your mouth is as big
as a basket and twice as empty.

711
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,970
I don't like you, period.

712
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,290
But neither do I agree with the column,

713
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:28,050
that you smoke marijuana
and belong with the Reds.

714
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:32,650
Also, since we're talking repulsive,
JJ won't like this for two cents.

715
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,690
Don't gimme that look, Dallas.
JJ believes in fair play.

716
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:39,290
And this could splatter his sister
with rotten egg by implication.

717
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,050
- You're the boyfriend.
- You're talking very fast.

718
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:47,010
I'll tell you what! Excuse me for breathing.
How do you like this two-bit banjo player!

719
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,010
- He comes into my office...
- Look!

720
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:52,450
- Wise guys...
- Boys, boys. This gets nobody nowhere.

721
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,960
- You're overexcited.
- Don't apologise for me.

722
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,010
And with good reason, I wanted to say.

723
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,490
This endangers the future of the Quintet.

724
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:02,770
- Should I cry?
- People catch on quick to such an item.

725
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:05,650
Van Cleve already called me.
He's firing the Quintet.

726
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,050
So why are you here?
Go over there and fight.

727
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:11,770
Look, if Van Cleve fires your boy,
that'll give that lie a ring of truth.

728
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,010
(Steve) I wanna speak
to Miss Hunsecker, please.

729
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:18,960
- Hello?
- Susie, this is Steve.

730
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:23,970
Don't be alarmed, but I want you to look
at Elwell's column in the Record. Today.

731
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,570
No, it's about me. A smear.

732
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:32,290
A smear? What kind of a smear?
Where are you?

733
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:36,970
On our way to the Elysian to dicker
with Van Cleve. He's fired us already.

734
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,050
Look, I'll call you later, dear.

735
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,130
Goodbye.

736
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,770
Come on, Frank.

737
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:00,800
If I told Steve what I really think,
he'd tear your head off.

738
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:03,050
- Tell him.
- No.

739
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,890
I'm interested in his future.

740
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:14,120
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

741
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:24,090
Sally, I sometimes get the impression
you think you live in Star Bright Park.

742
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,370
This is life. Get used to it.

743
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,650
(phone rings)

744
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:46,810
- Yes.
- JJ, I presume you saw the Elwell smear.

745
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,170
No. No medals. Not yet.

746
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,930
It's a lot worse than that.

747
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:55,010
Aunty Van Cleve is firing 'em.

748
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:59,880
I got it from the horse's mouth.
They were just here in a panic.

749
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,250
They're already traced the smear to you?

750
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,810
Then what are you so smug about?
Susie isn't dumb.

751
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,970
If she puts two and two together,
I'm a chicken in a pot.

752
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,130
JJ, peace on earth and goodwill to men.

753
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,560
Everything's working out
just how I planned.

754
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,570
I guarantee the bomb'll
pop right on schedule.

755
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,330
"Get him back his..."
You said "Get him back his job".

756
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,490
For what?

757
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:27,250
Sidney, this is travelling in the dark. You
better get over here as fast as you can.

758
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:31,610
Wait a minute. Susie's up and about.
I'll have to do a fine song and dance.

759
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,890
Meet me at the TV about three o'clock.

760
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:55,330
Susie. Come in a minute, dear.

761
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,970
Susie, you're very much
in my thoughts today.

762
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,650
Why?

763
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:12,690
"Why? " What a question, dear,
with that newspaper in your hand.

764
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,920
Did Sidney tell you about it?

765
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,410
Yes, he phoned.

766
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,810
Susie, I don't know this boy too well.

767
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,050
Anything in these charges?

768
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:33,410
- You're not being partial, are you?
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

769
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:36,290
Now, take it easy. You don't
have to protest with me.

770
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,410
I'll trust your judgment.

771
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:41,530
Come into camp, you poor kid.
You look so nervous.

772
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,450
You're trembling, dear.

773
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,330
Sidney didn't take long
to phone you, did he?

774
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:55,170
Naturally. Anything that
touches you touches me.

775
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,330
Doesn't it?

776
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,930
You know, dear, we're
drifting apart, you and I.

777
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,090
And I don't like it.

778
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,890
A year ago, would you have
walked past that door

779
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,650
without coming in to take
up the situation with me?

780
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:18,250
- Today I had to call you in!
- I'm taking up the situation with you now.

781
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,970
Let me finish. You've had
your say. Let me have mine.

782
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,170
But I haven't said anything, JJ.

783
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,090
Susie, I wanna help you.

784
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,570
You're all I've got
in this whole wide world.

785
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:38,650
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you.
What do you want me to do? Name it.

786
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:42,010
Because I don't like
that troubled look on your face.

787
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:47,810
If you really wanna help me, JJ,
get Steve back his job.

788
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:51,010
He means that much to you?

789
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,090
Yes.

790
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,720
With your prestige,
it'll only take a minute.

791
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:59,810
10 cents worth of American Tel and Tel.

792
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:05,290
- You're picking up my lingo, honey.
- I read your column every day.

793
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:15,370
I like this crisp, new attitude of yours.
You're growing up, and I like it.

794
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:20,090
I don't like it when you're limp
and dependent, or odd and wayward.

795
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,570
This Dallas boy must be good for you.

796
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:27,290
Bring him around today, before the show.
I'll clean my glasses for a better look.

797
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,850
Let me have Billy Van Cleve.

798
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,210
Don't ever tell anyone
how I'm tied to your apron strings.

799
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:38,290
Billy? JJ Hunsecker.

800
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,250
Now what about this Dallas boy?

801
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:05,730
"A man has a right to face his accuser.
That's the American way. The man said."

802
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:09,250
Don't hang around. If I run over,
I'll cut some items off the tail.

803
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:12,410
"From Washington through Jefferson,
from Lincoln and FDR,

804
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:15,210
right up to today,
the democratic way of life."

805
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:19,040
"That's what the man said.
Nowadays, it doesn't export too well."

806
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:24,610
"But you know and I know that our best
secret weapon is d-e-m-o-c-r-a-c-y."

807
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:29,250
That's grand. Just grand, JJ.

808
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:32,650
- Is my make-up all right? Despite the...
- It's fine, it's fine.

809
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:36,770
Mary, take care of Miss Tam. Anything
she wants. She's our star today.

810
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:47,080
I got that boy coming here today.
If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can,

811
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:50,210
Susie knows all about your dirty work.

812
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,330
Can't hurt.

813
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:55,930
"Can't hurt"? I had to get
that boy his job back.

814
00:59:56,060 --> 01:00:00,090
Look, JJ. We can tie this off
into one neat bundle.

815
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:02,410
Address it to the dumps, to oblivion.

816
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,610
We're doing great,
but please do it my way.

817
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:07,650
I've cased this kid.
I know his ins and outs.

818
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:12,090
He's full of juice and vinegar, waiting for
a big shot like you to put on the squeeze.

819
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:15,490
You got the boy's job back.
But he's not gonna accept your favour.

820
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:18,290
The manager, yeah, but not that boy.

821
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:27,130
- What has this boy got that Susie likes?
- Integrity. Acute, like indigestion.

822
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,450
What does this mean, "integrity"?

823
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:35,050
A pocketful of firecrackers...
waitin' for a match.

824
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,970
You know, it's a new wrinkle.

825
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:42,690
I never thought I'd make a killing
on some guy's integrity.

826
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:48,730
I'd hate to take a bite out of you.
You're a cookie full of arsenic.

827
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,050
I still think he's behind the smears.

828
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:02,490
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll
never prove it in a 1,000 years.

829
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:05,370
Steve,

830
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,930
you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt.

831
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:11,490
If he offers you an olive branch,
so today like olives.

832
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:15,810
Excuse me.

833
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,490
Steve, before we go in, could I...

834
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:29,810
Hi! Just in time.
JJ just finished up his rehearsal.

835
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:40,090
(JJ) Looks like a wedding.

836
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,850
You look lovely, dear.

837
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:50,170
- Steve, you've met my brother?
- Of course.

838
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,570
Frank.

839
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:55,370
Looks like you went out and got
a packet of trouble for yourself.

840
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,530
You've been very kind about it.

841
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:01,050
Give Susie credit for that.
She said there was nothing to the smear.

842
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:05,090
As a matter of fact, I'll have plenty
to say about smears on my show today.

843
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:09,570
And that's why I'd...
Well, I'd like your personal assurance too.

844
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:13,730
Mr Hunsecker, there is nothing to
this smear. You have my sincere word.

845
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:16,570
I'll buy that. Now you do me a favour.

846
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:21,730
- Be good to my kid sister.
- Yeah. She's had a lotta trouble for a kid.

847
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:24,730
Susie has her girlish secrets,
but in her heart of hearts,

848
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:28,330
I imagine she fancies you
in an uncommon way.

849
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,760
Now how about you? Not just, uh...

850
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:33,200
Well, not just tomcatting around, I hope?

851
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:35,970
- JJ, Steve is not...
- Take it easy, Susie.

852
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:40,800
Steve wouldn't be much of a man
if he didn't understand my concern.

853
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:43,130
No, I wouldn't.

854
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:46,770
Serious as a deacon.
I like it. I like it fine.

855
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,650
In a world of old rags and bones, I like it.

856
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,690
Now, you take Sidney here.

857
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,000
If Sidney ever got anywhere near Susie,

858
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:59,250
I'd take a baseball bat
and break it over his head.

859
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:04,410
Sidney lives so much in moral twilight,

860
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:07,650
that when I said you were
coming here, he predicted disaster.

861
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,730
Said you wouldn't take my favour.

862
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:12,690
He said you'd chew up the job
and spit it back in my face.

863
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:15,380
- Any truth in that?
- Since you bring it up...

864
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:18,170
No, Mr Hunsecker. If I can amplify...

865
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,250
Don't amplify.

866
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,810
Steve would like
to thank you for this favour.

867
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:26,640
You don't listen very good, do you?
JJ said to keep your mouth shut.

868
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:31,010
Isn't it time you shut yours? Who are
you to tell Frank D'Angelo to shut up?

869
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,090
Steve, this isn't important.

870
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:35,170
Does he have to be here?

871
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,250
Why? Has he bothered you before?

872
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:42,250
- Is it news to you?
- People tell me I'm a very gifted man,

873
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,610
but I still can't see around corners.

874
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:47,730
Just what exactly are you so hot about?

875
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:51,770
I know it's difficult to be an artist
in this crudest of all possible worlds...

876
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:54,490
Look, I'm not here as an artist.

877
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:57,810
I'm here as an average Joe
who happens to love your sister.

878
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:01,480
Well, just be careful
you don't knock her off her feet, hm?

879
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:08,250
Frankly, son, I lost you on that last hill.
Just give us the punch line.

880
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:10,730
Steve.

881
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:13,730
There's no punch line.

882
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:16,650
Maybe I was admiring your
know-how. Yours and Falco's.

883
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:19,410
Why do you keep
coupling me with Falco?

884
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,490
Why is he here?

885
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:26,410
Tell me, sir, when he dies do you think
he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?

886
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:30,370
Let's forget about dogs and cats
and all that pseudo-literary junk.

887
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,850
I'll lay it on the line. What about
that ruckus in my office today?

888
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:38,970
You were there, Frank. According to
St Dallas, JJ was behind the Elwell smear.

889
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:42,330
- Don't go wild, Sidney.
- Look at them and tell me who's wild.

890
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:45,930
- Steve was overexcited. He didn't mean...
- How did you mean it?

891
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,170
Quiet! All of you.

892
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,530
Susie, sit down.
This requires investigation.

893
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:56,530
How did you mean it?
Come on, I'm waiting.

894
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:59,890
I don't take kindly to you
and Falco teaching me ethics.

895
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,970
Who's the injured party here? You?

896
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,810
You have no right to ask questions.
And your snide...

897
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:08,610
Wait a minute. I haven't handed over
punishing privileges to you yet.

898
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:11,090
Lay the whip down.
I might respect what you say.

899
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,130
- Steve...
- Shut up.

900
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:18,160
Susie, did you know
about this accusation?

901
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:20,250
No.

902
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:26,920
Before you leave, son,
I'll answer your question.

903
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:29,010
Susan Hunsecker's the injured party.

904
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:33,010
Or perhaps you'll be telling me
I don't have my sister's welfare at heart.

905
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:36,210
You've got more twists
than a barrel of pretzels.

906
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,290
Did you hear that, Susie?

907
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,660
- Continue, please.
- I can't cope with them.

908
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:44,370
You're too shrewd for me,
so I'll just be honest.

909
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,880
Susie and I are in love.
We wanna get married.

910
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:50,290
Give him credit.
The boy's gall is gorgeous.

911
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:53,980
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?

912
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:59,850
That's stout of you, but perhaps Susie
may not care to air her views in public.

913
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:05,010
Susie?

914
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:07,850
Susie, as always, is free
to say anything she wants.

915
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:11,090
Go on, dear.
Say exactly what's on your mind, dear.

916
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:13,650
Those "dears" sound like daggers.

917
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:16,450
- What are you trying to do?
- Get her to stand up to you,

918
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:18,570
but you make her afraid to speak!

919
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:23,170
- Son, you raise your voice once more...
- Steve, please, please stop.

920
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:25,250
- JJ...
- I'm sorry, Susie.

921
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:42,970
Well, son, it looks like we may have
to call this game on account of darkness.

922
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:46,890
If looks could kill, I'd be dead.

923
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:51,690
No, I don't care about you. My whole
interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie.

924
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:55,450
And how to undo what you've done to her.

925
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:58,890
What have I done to her, except
not buy her a new fur coat lately?

926
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:01,650
You were right, Sidney. This boy is a dilly.

927
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:07,290
Why? Because I don't like the way you toy
with people? Your contempt and malice?

928
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:10,610
Sorry, Frank. You think
about yourself and your column.

929
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:13,570
To you, you're some kind
of a national glory,

930
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,970
but to me, and a lot of people like me,

931
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:19,570
your slimy scandal
and your phoney patriotics...

932
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:22,690
To me, Mr Hunsecker,
you're a national disgrace.

933
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:31,530
Son, I don't relish shooting
mosquitoes with elephant guns.

934
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:34,170
Suppose you just shuffle
along and call it a day?

935
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,250
My day with Susie isn't over yet.

936
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:39,290
Here's your head. What's your hurry?

937
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,570
You did it, JJ. You did it good.

938
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:57,730
Susie, I'd have to take it very much
amiss if you ever saw that boy again.

939
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:05,570
I'll never see him again.

940
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:43,250
Mary, call Van Cleve at this number.

941
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:47,810
Tell him I said he was right. Those
Dallas boys are not worthy of his club.

942
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,930
Taxi!

943
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,530
Susie. Susie!

944
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,250
Ouch!

945
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:10,960
Mr Hunsecker, this was to be
delivered to you personally.

946
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,770
- This is warm.
- You wanted them at the table.

947
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:23,880
Are you a critic?

948
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:26,530
- I'll change them.
- Forget it, forget it.

949
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,770
We're on the verge of a farce. A real farce.

950
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:34,050
As I see it, if Susie had stood behind him
today, he might have proved a threat.

951
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:38,250
But since primarily he's wedded to his
work, he's not gonna be able to take it.

952
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:40,650
Stop tinkering. That horseradish is fine.

953
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:44,810
It's all over, because any hour now
that boy will give her up.

954
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:47,250
Now, is it a farce, or is it?

955
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:50,730
Sidney, this syrup you're giving out,

956
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:53,320
you pour over waffles, not JJ Hunsecker.

957
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:57,570
What do you mean,
this lousy kid'll give up my sister?

958
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:04,650
How does it matter whose sister?
The main thing is that they're through.

959
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:09,280
Am I supposed to forget
how that kid talked to me today?

960
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:12,650
JJ, is he worthy of a second glance
from a man like you?

961
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:15,160
- I mean that...
- Bite on this.

962
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:22,450
- Steamship tickets.
- The next sailing. Susie's run down.

963
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:29,650
That's good. Now that louse
is outta Susie's hair for good.

964
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:32,050
I want that boy taken apart.

965
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:42,890
JJ, why do something that's gonna drive
them right back into each other's arms?

966
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:45,480
I know how to handle Susie. You just...

967
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:51,730
You just handle the boy.

968
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:53,810
Preferably tonight.

969
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:56,530
What's tomorrow? A holiday?

970
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:02,530
(JJ) Your fat cop friend.

971
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:07,450
I think I'm going home. Maybe I left
my sense of humour in my other suit.

972
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:10,690
You've got a god-given brain,
Sidney. Use it.

973
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:13,380
You think this is
a personal thing with me?

974
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:16,930
Are you telling me I think of this
in terms of personal pique?

975
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:19,690
Today that boy wiped
his feet on the choice,

976
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:24,610
on the predilections of 60 million people
in the greatest country in the world.

977
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:29,530
If you had any morals, you'd understand
the immorality of that boy's stand today.

978
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:33,490
It wasn't me he criticised.
It was my readers.

979
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:42,650
Don't remove the gangplank, Sidney.
You may wanna get back on board.

980
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,760
JJ, it's one thing to wear your dog collar.

981
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:48,460
When it turns into a noose,
I'd rather have my freedom.

982
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:51,410
The man in jail is always for freedom.

983
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,770
Except, if you'll excuse me,
I'm not in jail.

984
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:58,210
You're in jail. You're a prisoner of your
own fears, your own greed and ambition.

985
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:01,650
You're blind, Mr Magoo.
This is the crossroads for me.

986
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:04,890
I won't get Kello. Not for
a lifetime pass to the Polo Grounds.

987
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:07,480
Not if you served me Cleopatra on a plate.

988
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:10,730
- Sidney, I told you...
- I swear on my mother's life,

989
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:14,850
I wouldn't do that. Not if you gave me
a column would I do a thing...

990
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:28,050
Who do you think writes the column while
Susie and I are away for three months?

991
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:31,930
The man in the moon?
Thank you, Sidney.

992
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:35,610
And, Sidney, I'll have
that piece of paper back.

993
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:47,650
Two cups of coffee.

994
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:06,160
Steve, I love the way
you stood up to my brother.

995
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:10,090
Nobody ever did that before.

996
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,850
But it frightened me.

997
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:17,570
Is that why you walked out?

998
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,450
Yes.

999
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:25,530
What you say to me, it's true.

1000
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:29,690
I'm weak. I can't change.

1001
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:41,210
I gather... you're trying to say goodbye.

1002
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:45,330
Yes.

1003
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:50,850
I came here with half
an idea of saying goodbye.

1004
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,720
But I guess I'll hang around...

1005
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,810
to plead.

1006
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:03,490
Susie, is this really what you want?

1007
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:07,330
Yes.

1008
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:11,210
My brother's capable of doing you
very great harm. I can't let that happen.

1009
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:14,490
- I won't give you up.
- We can't see each other again.

1010
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:17,570
Susie, that's fish four day's old.
I won't buy it.

1011
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:21,210
Outta that mouth I love,
like a ventriloquist's dummy,

1012
01:14:21,340 --> 01:14:24,850
- Your brother is saying goodbye.
- No, Steve.

1013
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:26,730
Please don't.

1014
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,770
Please don't.

1015
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:32,200
At least this way I'll know that...

1016
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:37,290
you'll be somewhere in the world,
alive and happy, working.

1017
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:40,890
I won't give you up.

1018
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:49,250
You've got to go.

1019
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,170
This coat is your brother.

1020
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,250
I've always hated this coat.

1021
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:22,010
Goodbye, Mr D'Angelo.
Take care of Steve.

1022
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,930
Say something funny, Mr Hasenpfeffer.

1023
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,650
Look back and see
if she's still standing there.

1024
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:07,560
She's still standing there.

1025
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:36,690
I'll have a straight coke.

1026
01:16:48,860 --> 01:16:51,050
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1027
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:53,810
Excuse me, Joe.

1028
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:56,890
- Steve don't feel too good.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

1029
01:16:57,020 --> 01:17:00,010
So, if you don't mind,
he'd like to leave after this set.

1030
01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:04,330
(Joe) I like that boy, Frank.
Anything he wants to do is OK with me.

1031
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,730
Hey, Mr Falco!

1032
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:23,600
I hate to give you the satisfaction,

1033
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:29,130
but they broke it off tonight for good.

1034
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:33,090
Tell that to Hunsecker.
Tell him we agree, he's a big man.

1035
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:35,210
He wins all the marbles.

1036
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:13,930
What's all the rush?
I thought you said three o'clock.

1037
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:18,170
He's leaving early, right after this set.

1038
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:21,010
It's nice, Sidney, you giving me this tip.

1039
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:23,370
- He's got 'em on him.
- And he's got 'em on him.

1040
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,800
I appreciate a thing like this.

1041
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:29,890
And I appreciate where you're
lookin' out for the virtue of the city.

1042
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:32,370
- What's ya hurry?
- Let go of me, Kello.

1043
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:35,770
Hey, Murph! Do you like this face?

1044
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:40,410
Well, I'll be doggoned, it's melting.
Something got you scared, Sidney?

1045
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:43,100
Listen. Rectify me a certain thing.

1046
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:46,890
Weren't you kiddin', snooks,
when you told JJ I was fat?

1047
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:53,010
Rest in peace, Kello, you're skinny.
But JJ says you sweat.

1048
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:56,010
(laughs)

1049
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,810
Is that a fact?

1050
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:00,320
He's a dilly, ain't he?

1051
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:05,770
I get the distinct impression, snooks,
that you don't like me. Could I be wrong?

1052
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:08,280
You could be right, ya fat slob!

1053
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:10,290
(laughter)

1054
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:14,010
Come back, Sidney! I wanna chastise you.

1055
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:38,210
Thank you very much.

1056
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:37,370
Hey, fella.

1057
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:53,810
Three Scotches,
one vodka and orange juice...

1058
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:58,890
- Sidney, there's a phone call for you.
- Lou, I told you I'm not takin' any calls.

1059
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,530
I don't care who calls. No calls.

1060
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:06,330
- I still wanna make a toast.
- I'm buyin' the booze, so I make the toast.

1061
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:10,970
Here's to the thing we dream about.
It makes you cool in the summertime...

1062
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:12,320
Hey, how ya been?

1063
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:14,290
- Sidney.
- Hello, Charlie.

1064
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:16,980
I'm Herbie, remember?
The funniest man in town.

1065
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:20,610
Gentlemen, I'm toasting
my favourite new perfume.

1066
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:23,890
Success.

1067
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:29,650
Sorry, kid. It's important.
The operator at 21 took the message.

1068
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:32,370
I'm not takin' messages
unless it's JJ Hunsecker.

1069
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,650
It is. He wants you
to come over to his house.

1070
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:37,690
Gentlemen, duty calls,
and the best of friends must part.

1071
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:41,850
Sidney, Al and I talked it over
and we want you to handle our account.

1072
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:45,010
One of you guys want
a bread-and-butter account?

1073
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:48,410
Sidney, why don't you take me along?
Maybe I'll rub his back for ya.

1074
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:16,090
JJ?

1075
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:34,810
JJ?

1076
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:49,130
Susie?

1077
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:56,650
Susie?

1078
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,330
What...

1079
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:09,250
What are you doing out there
this time of the night?

1080
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:10,930
The door was open.

1081
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:15,050
- Where's JJ?
- He isn't here.

1082
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:17,800
- I got a message to come over.
- Did you?

1083
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:22,130
- Well, if he isn't here, I...
- Mr D'Angelo phoned.

1084
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:26,970
- Yeah?
- About Steve.

1085
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:33,210
I went down...

1086
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:37,010
I went down to the hospital,
but they wouldn't let me in.

1087
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:39,920
It's all over town about Dallas.

1088
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:42,770
How is he?

1089
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,450
They wouldn't let me in.

1090
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:50,930
But I gave Steve up.

1091
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,090
Why'd you and JJ do it?

1092
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:59,000
What are you talking about?
Who gives you the right to talk like that?

1093
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:01,090
Don't bother to lie, Sidney.

1094
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:04,450
I don't care any more.

1095
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:10,010
Look, Susie, you're very upset,
so I'm not gonna argue with you.

1096
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:12,250
Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.

1097
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,890
Why don't you go to bed
and get a good night's sleep?

1098
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:17,400
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself.

1099
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:20,740
I'm sorry about my brother.

1100
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:25,920
And I'm sorry about you too,
because you're going down with the ship.

1101
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:28,010
- What ship?
- This ship.

1102
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:34,320
Don't you know how my brother's
gonna see you after tonight?

1103
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:36,490
You're gonna be the man who...

1104
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:39,330
drove his beloved little sister to suicide.

1105
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:45,810
You know, I've heard
this woman-talk before.

1106
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:48,450
Why don't you start growin' up, huh?

1107
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:52,290
Start thinking with your head
instead of your hips.

1108
01:24:55,820 --> 01:25:00,290
I got nothing against women thinking
with their hips. That's their nature.

1109
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:05,130
Just like it's a man's nature to go out
and hustle and get the things he wants.

1110
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:07,850
Susie, look at yourself.

1111
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:11,850
You're 1 9 years old. Just a kid,
and you're falling apart at the seams.

1112
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:16,130
You tiptoe around on those bird legs
of yours, nervous and incompetent,

1113
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:19,130
with a fatality for
doing wrong, picking wrong,

1114
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:21,890
and giving up even
before you start a fight.

1115
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:29,370
Wait a minute.
It's the truth and the truth hurts.

1116
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:32,180
Visit me when I'm not
writing your brother's column

1117
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:35,170
and I'll revise that delicate outlook of life.

1118
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:38,490
To give credit where credit is due,

1119
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:43,330
that body of yours deserves a better
fate than tumbling off some terrace.

1120
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:45,930
Susie?

1121
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:48,930
A bed is the best friend a girl ever had.

1122
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:51,010
Pleasant dreams.

1123
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:57,050
Hey, now, don't be no square.
Don't do anything stupid.

1124
01:25:59,060 --> 01:26:01,010
Susie?

1125
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,130
Susie!

1126
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:15,530
Su... Susie!

1127
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:17,610
Susie!

1128
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:29,610
Are you crazy? Are you outta your mind?

1129
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:37,050
(Susie yells)

1130
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:40,810
What would your brother say
if I told him you tried a thing like that?

1131
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:43,050
- I'll get you a drink.
- No! Go away!

1132
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:50,490
Susie, look, I'm sorry.

1133
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:52,920
If I did anything to hurt you...

1134
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:53,810
Get out of here!

1135
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:56,290
I did it for you.

1136
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:05,850
(JJ) It's all right, Susie. I'm here.

1137
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:11,770
Take it easy, dear.

1138
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:16,400
- JJ, Susie wasn't...
- Calm yourself, dear. Don't worry.

1139
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:18,490
(Susie sobs)

1140
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:29,290
Put this on, Susie.

1141
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:43,760
It's lucky I came over
after I got your message.

1142
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:47,290
- I got here as quickly as I could, but...
- What message?

1143
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:52,170
What message?

1144
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,490
Well, be that as it may,
someone called me.

1145
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:59,570
It's just lucky I came over here in time.

1146
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:01,650
Why?

1147
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:05,650
JJ, Susie was so depressed
she tried to kill herself.

1148
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,730
Depressed?

1149
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:12,410
- About what?
- She heard the news about Dallas.

1150
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:19,410
What news about Dallas?

1151
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:23,640
Oh, uh...

1152
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:27,050
I took it for granted
that you heard about it around town.

1153
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:31,170
You're not gonna like this, but they
picked him up on a marijuana rap.

1154
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:34,090
And is that why
you put your hands on my sister?

1155
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:40,210
JJ, please.

1156
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:43,130
Susie tried to throw herself
off the terrace.

1157
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:47,090
Susie, tell him the truth!

1158
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:55,370
Tell him!

1159
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,530
JJ, please. Look, I can explain.

1160
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:01,730
JJ...

1161
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:08,570
Stop!

1162
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,850
You're defending your sister, ya phoney?!

1163
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:13,930
Didn't you tell me
to get Kello? Didn't you...

1164
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:26,410
Susie, just as I know he's lying
about your attempted suicide,

1165
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:29,210
you know he's lying about me.

1166
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:31,850
We can't leave it like this, can we?

1167
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:37,410
I suggest you go to bed, dear.

1168
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:42,890
You're growing up.

1169
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:45,930
Cute!

1170
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:51,170
Sergeant? This is JJ Hunsecker.
Let me talk to Lieutenant Kello.

1171
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:54,650
Harry? Sorry to bother you,
but a bad mistake has been made.

1172
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:58,130
JJ, you've got such contempt
for people, it makes you stupid.

1173
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:02,370
You didn't beat those kids.
You've lost her. You'll never get her back.

1174
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:05,970
Harry, Sidney Falco
planted that stuff on Dallas.

1175
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,810
Jealousy. Behind my back,
he was tryin' to make my sister.

1176
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:17,160
That fat cop can break my bones, but he'll
never stop me from telling what I know.

1177
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:22,370
He's leavin' right now.

1178
01:30:29,660 --> 01:30:31,610
Where do you think you're going?

1179
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:40,490
I'm leaving. I'm going to Steve.

1180
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:45,970
No. You're going to the hands
of a good psychoanalyst.

1181
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:48,330
You tried to kill yourself tonight.

1182
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:53,890
Yes.

1183
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:59,410
I'd rather be dead than living with you.

1184
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:20,930
For all the things you've done,
JJ, I know I should hate you.

1185
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:25,210
But I don't. I pity you.

1186
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:35,890
