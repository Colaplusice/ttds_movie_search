1
00:01:57,052 --> 00:01:59,054
Where's Bailey?

2
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:05,810
Deaf and dumb, eh?

3
00:02:16,946 --> 00:02:19,240
Can you read lips?

4
00:02:19,824 --> 00:02:22,410
Where is Bailey?

5
00:02:24,162 --> 00:02:26,498
Coming back today?

6
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:29,876
Come on.

7
00:02:57,737 --> 00:03:00,699
- Hello, Marny.
- Well, look who is back.

8
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:02,325
- Did you dye your hair?
- Why?

9
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:04,119
I keep thinking of you as a blond.

10
00:03:04,202 --> 00:03:07,330
For all the thinking you do about me,
I could be bald-headed.

11
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:10,083
Ham on rye. Did you miss me, honey?

12
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,128
If I didn't, I can't think
of anybody else who did.

13
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:15,765
One thing's sure, Bailey
don't miss nothing.

14
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:16,673
Neither do you.

15
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:18,633
She's your girl,
and he ain't my man.

16
00:03:18,717 --> 00:03:21,636
So it's no skin off my nose.
I just see what I see.

17
00:03:21,678 --> 00:03:23,513
You sure you don't see what you hear?

18
00:03:23,596 --> 00:03:26,933
Nothing can happen in this town
that I don't hear about it.

19
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:30,687
I'm just saying what I see.
Every day they go fishing together.

20
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:32,313
Look, the sandwich.

21
00:03:32,397 --> 00:03:37,110
Two things I can smell inside 100 feet:
Burning hamburger and a romance.

22
00:03:37,162 --> 00:03:39,195
You got a customer.

23
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,739
- What'll you have?
- Coffee.

24
00:03:40,864 --> 00:03:44,159
- Nothing else?
- Cream.

25
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:46,870
- Where you been this time?
- L.A.

26
00:03:46,911 --> 00:03:48,663
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

27
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:51,332
First she's got you,
now she's got you and Bailey.

28
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,377
And the only thing I seem to get is older.

29
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:57,005
Thanks a lot, Marny.
I'll see you later.

30
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:03,219
I guess I must have said something.

31
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,679
You talked enough.

32
00:04:05,305 --> 00:04:08,350
Everything people ought to know
they just don't want to hear.

33
00:04:08,402 --> 00:04:10,226
That's the trouble with the world.

34
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:13,480
Either that or you're on the wrong
side of the counter.

35
00:04:13,563 --> 00:04:16,983
- Tell me something.
- You don't look as though I could.

36
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:20,403
That Bailey who burns you up,
he run the gas station?

37
00:04:20,445 --> 00:04:23,698
- Do you know him?
- I might have once.

38
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,993
If he keeps mooning around Jim's girl,
nobody'll know him...

39
00:04:27,035 --> 00:04:29,371
...and that'd be too bad.

40
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:33,083
You see much of this Bailey?

41
00:04:33,124 --> 00:04:36,044
Yeah, every day from here.

42
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:38,088
I often wondered what happened to him...

43
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:42,926
...then one day I'm breezing through here,
and there's his name up on a sign.

44
00:04:43,218 --> 00:04:47,931
- It's a small world.
- Yeah, or a big sign.

45
00:05:03,822 --> 00:05:08,993
- They're just not feeding today.
- They will later. It's clouding up.

46
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:12,664
They say the day you die,
your name is written on a cloud.

47
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:14,791
- Who says?
- They.

48
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:17,001
Never heard of them.

49
00:05:17,085 --> 00:05:20,255
Nothing in that one but rain.
Think we ought to go home?

50
00:05:20,338 --> 00:05:21,631
Yes.

51
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:24,426
- Do you want to?
- No.

52
00:05:26,636 --> 00:05:30,640
Every time I look at the sky,
I think of all the places I've never been.

53
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:34,310
Yes, and every time you look up,
they're all the same.

54
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,481
- You've been a lot of places, haven't you?
- One too many.

55
00:05:38,523 --> 00:05:41,776
- Which did you like best?
- This one right here.

56
00:05:41,818 --> 00:05:45,780
- I bet you say that to all the places.
- You see that cove over there?

57
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:47,741
I'd like to build a house right there...

58
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:51,327
...marry you, live in it
and never go anywhere else.

59
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,539
I wish you would.

60
00:06:01,171 --> 00:06:04,799
You were never married before, were you?

61
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:07,010
Not that I can remember.

62
00:06:07,093 --> 00:06:08,928
That's good.

63
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:12,140
You'd be amazed the way
people talk about you.

64
00:06:12,182 --> 00:06:15,685
The mysterious Jeff Bailey.

65
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:20,273
My mother tells me that I've only
known you for such a short time.

66
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:22,776
And where'd you come from?
And what did you do?

67
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:27,655
My father was...

68
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,752
- We'd better go.
- Is something the matter?

69
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,712
Maybe not.

70
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:48,635
Here.

71
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,684
You sure are a secret man.

72
00:06:57,686 --> 00:06:59,646
Thanks.

73
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:02,899
Oh, a man just wants to see me.

74
00:07:23,503 --> 00:07:27,528
- A long time.
- Hello, Joe. I wish it was nicer to see you.

75
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,553
Everyone sure missed you, Jeff,
but not as much as I have.

76
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:33,680
- How's that?
- Whit used to look at me...

77
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:37,100
...shake his head,
and wish I had brains like you.

78
00:07:37,142 --> 00:07:41,229
- What's the other reason?
- I had to find you.

79
00:07:41,281 --> 00:07:43,231
- I owe you something?
- Not me.

80
00:07:43,314 --> 00:07:45,108
Who?

81
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:48,903
- How far can that kid read lips?
- I don't know. I'll ask him some time.

82
00:07:48,955 --> 00:07:50,822
This far?

83
00:07:50,947 --> 00:07:54,743
- You don't like to make mistakes, do you?
- They don't let me have many.

84
00:07:54,795 --> 00:07:57,120
All right, come on inside.

85
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:07,047
- Funny racket to find you in, Jeff.
- Yeah, me and the kid laugh all the time.

86
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:09,007
I guess that's because it's respectable.

87
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,093
That hash slinger across
the street says you are too.

88
00:08:12,135 --> 00:08:16,639
- How did you happen to find me, Joe?
- I was driving down the road one day...

89
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:21,144
...and who do I see pumping gasoline
but my old chum from the old times.

90
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:23,355
Of course, there's a different
name on the sign.

91
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,191
- So you just dropped in?
- Why not?

92
00:08:26,232 --> 00:08:29,319
Okay, then I'm glad to see an old pal too.

93
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:33,323
So I take you to dinner, buy you
drinks, it gets late chewing the fat...

94
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,617
...you hop in your car
and you're gone. Right?

95
00:08:35,742 --> 00:08:38,578
- Almost.
- What else?

96
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,872
I'm still working for that guy, Jeff.

97
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:43,166
- Whit?
- He'd like to see you.

98
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:45,877
As much as you did?

99
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,953
- Worse.
- I see.

100
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:51,341
No one ever thought more of you than Whit.

101
00:08:51,424 --> 00:08:52,759
Or more about me.

102
00:08:52,884 --> 00:08:56,429
Well, that could be too.

103
00:08:56,471 --> 00:09:00,934
- All right, what's he want, Joe?
- Maybe he's got something nice for you.

104
00:09:00,986 --> 00:09:02,519
Try once more.

105
00:09:02,602 --> 00:09:06,189
Look, Whit never steered
you into anything bad, did he?

106
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:09,984
Why, he never even squawked when
you blew the best thing he ever gave you.

107
00:09:10,036 --> 00:09:14,114
- Go on.
- The guy just wants to see you.

108
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:16,157
Well, you put it that way, what can I do?

109
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:19,035
You know of any other way to put it?

110
00:09:22,247 --> 00:09:24,499
- Say tomorrow morning?
- Where?

111
00:09:24,624 --> 00:09:30,380
Lake Tahoe. Turn right at Emerald Bay.
Big house on a hill. You won't miss it.

112
00:09:30,797 --> 00:09:33,466
You can't.

113
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:58,241
Ann? John, are you letting
her out like this?

114
00:09:58,283 --> 00:10:03,329
Are you gonna stand for it, with a man
who won't even come to the door?

115
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:07,792
Don't worry about them.

116
00:10:08,585 --> 00:10:11,379
- Darling.
- It's no good, is it?

117
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:16,092
- It doesn't matter. It's just that they...
- Oh, honey, I know how they feel.

118
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:18,762
- Don't worry about it.
- I'm not.

119
00:10:18,845 --> 00:10:22,974
- Then don't look so grim.
- No, it's something else.

120
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:26,144
- What?
- That guy that showed up today...

121
00:10:26,227 --> 00:10:28,313
Yes?

122
00:10:28,438 --> 00:10:30,398
You want to ride with me
up to Lake Tahoe?

123
00:10:30,482 --> 00:10:32,609
- Now?
- Yes, now.

124
00:10:32,692 --> 00:10:34,152
I want to tell you something.

125
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:36,321
All right, Jeff.

126
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:39,324
You told me once
I'd have to tell you sometime.

127
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:42,285
Well, this is it.

128
00:10:57,592 --> 00:11:02,472
Now, the first thing I wanna get off my
chest: My name isn't Bailey, it's Markham.

129
00:11:02,524 --> 00:11:07,102
- Markham. Jeff Markham?
- I should have told you before.

130
00:11:07,154 --> 00:11:10,297
I meant to, but I kept putting it off...

131
00:11:10,349 --> 00:11:13,441
...because I didn't like any part of it.

132
00:11:13,566 --> 00:11:16,820
- Please tell me, Jeff.
- Some of it's gonna hurt you.

133
00:11:16,872 --> 00:11:19,197
It doesn't matter.

134
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,867
Well, our friend Markham
lived in New York.

135
00:11:22,909 --> 00:11:27,622
He worked with a sort of stupid,
oily gent by the name of Jack Fisher.

136
00:11:27,674 --> 00:11:30,959
We called ourselves detectives.

137
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:34,629
That was about three years ago,
maybe more.

138
00:11:34,671 --> 00:11:39,384
Wintertime. One of the coldest days
I remember in the town.

139
00:11:39,436 --> 00:11:41,594
And we got a call to come and see a big op.

140
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,473
- A what?
- An operator, gambler.

141
00:11:45,515 --> 00:11:49,727
He didn't come to see us because he was
too high-powered a character.

142
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:53,940
Also, because some dame had taken
four shots at him with his own.38.

143
00:11:53,992 --> 00:11:56,317
Made one of them good.

144
00:12:00,363 --> 00:12:03,867
He was taking it in stride,
but he had a friend who was a ball of fire.

145
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,954
Newspaper guys, wise guys,
who do they think they're kidding?

146
00:12:08,006 --> 00:12:10,331
So he shot himself
cleaning a cap pistol.

147
00:12:10,373 --> 00:12:13,752
So I shot the ace of spades
out of a sleeve during a gin game.

148
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:15,712
A guy can't even get shot by a dame...

149
00:12:15,795 --> 00:12:18,882
...without the whole town
starting to buzz like a...

150
00:12:18,965 --> 00:12:23,053
Like you? Smoke a cigarette, Joe.

151
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:29,893
You just sit and stay inside yourself.
You wait for me to talk. I like that.

152
00:12:29,945 --> 00:12:33,355
I never found out much
listening to myself.

153
00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:40,987
- It amazes me how she missed so often.
- Maybe you were moving.

154
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,656
A dame with a rod is like a guy
with a knitting needle.

155
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:47,577
- What's he doing here? I called you.
- My partner.

156
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:54,709
- Should I ask why you didn't call the law?
- Should you?

157
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:56,795
I guess not.

158
00:12:56,878 --> 00:12:59,297
- Anything happen to her?
- She ran out on me.

159
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:01,800
- With 40,000 bucks.
- I want her back.

160
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:04,135
Or the money?

161
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:10,475
You know, I once bet $40,000 on a horse
that ran dead last, so I bought the horse.

162
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,268
Yeah, that's what I mean.

163
00:13:12,352 --> 00:13:16,043
Oh, you're wrong. I put that horse
in a nice green pasture...

164
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:19,734
...so he'd never get his foot
caught in a mutuel machine.

165
00:13:19,776 --> 00:13:22,153
You should go out and visit it sometime.

166
00:13:23,905 --> 00:13:29,452
No, I just want her back.
When you see her, you'll understand better.

167
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:31,830
Maybe she's just an impulsive girl.

168
00:13:33,206 --> 00:13:37,961
- Shall we let it go at that?
- I can let it all go.

169
00:13:38,712 --> 00:13:43,591
An even 5000 now
and 5 when you bring her back.

170
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,760
And expenses.

171
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:48,680
Now, that should have been
the first thing you said.

172
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:52,392
- Find her, Jeff. Bring her back.
- Why me?

173
00:13:52,434 --> 00:13:58,773
Well, I know a lot of smart guys
and a few honest ones, and you're both.

174
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:04,612
What happens to her?

175
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:07,490
I won't touch her.

176
00:14:12,203 --> 00:14:14,706
Okay.

177
00:14:14,748 --> 00:14:18,168
Get me the stuff on her family,
pictures, anything interesting.

178
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:20,211
- You'll get it.
- I'll see you.

179
00:14:20,295 --> 00:14:23,840
You bring it over, Joe.
Come on, let's go.

180
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,887
Oh, by the way, you mind
telling me her name?

181
00:14:30,305 --> 00:14:34,684
- Kathie Moffat.
- Thanks.

182
00:14:36,603 --> 00:14:42,056
She must be quite a dame.
A wild goose with 40 G's.

183
00:14:42,108 --> 00:14:45,528
You know, for a smart guy, that Sterling
sure trusts you, don't he?

184
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,988
Why not?

185
00:14:47,072 --> 00:14:48,990
- Am I going along?
- No.

186
00:14:49,074 --> 00:14:53,411
Oh, he doesn't like my personality, huh?
Well, I'm still in, Jeff, 50/50.

187
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:56,581
- Did I say anything different?
- All right. It's a good soft touch.

188
00:14:56,623 --> 00:15:00,418
Don't get hot at me.
And don't get any cute ideas.

189
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:20,605
These are on me.

190
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,859
This is an old friend of mine, Jeff Markham.
He wants to ask you something.

191
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:28,571
- Which one of you is Eunice Leonard?
- Me.

192
00:15:28,613 --> 00:15:31,533
May I ask you a few questions?

193
00:15:34,703 --> 00:15:37,497
Come on, honey, let's dance.

194
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,919
You work for Katherine Moffat?

195
00:15:42,961 --> 00:15:45,880
Not anymore, she's gone.
She got pushed around.

196
00:15:45,964 --> 00:15:49,092
I wouldn't have stayed myself,
only she got sick being vaccinated.

197
00:15:49,175 --> 00:15:51,720
- How come you're asking?
- I want to find her.

198
00:15:51,803 --> 00:15:55,755
- You want to find her for that man?
- No, for myself. Where'd she go?

199
00:15:55,807 --> 00:15:59,561
- Maybe I oughtn't to tell nothing.
- More harm might come to her if you didn't.

200
00:15:59,613 --> 00:16:03,299
- Is she in harm now?
- I don't know, she disappeared.

201
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:06,985
- Maybe you better say, honey.
- Well, I can't say much.

202
00:16:07,027 --> 00:16:09,612
It wasn't no cold place though.
That girl hated snow.

203
00:16:09,696 --> 00:16:13,491
Them clothes she took,
she was looking for sun. Florida.

204
00:16:13,543 --> 00:16:17,287
- You sure about that?
- Now I seem to remember, and I'm sure.

205
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:20,707
- No trunk?
- She only took suitcases.

206
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:23,877
- You're sure again?
- I know, I weighed them for her.

207
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:26,629
- How much did they weigh?
- 131 pounds.

208
00:16:26,671 --> 00:16:28,048
- Exactly?
- Exactly.

209
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:31,843
- On account of that's what I weigh myself.
- Thanks.

210
00:16:31,895 --> 00:16:34,137
Bring them another round.

211
00:16:36,097 --> 00:16:39,809
<i>You don't get vaccinated for Florida,
but you do for Mexico.</i>

212
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:44,105
<i>So I just followed that 90 pounds
of excess baggage to Mexico City.</i>

213
00:16:44,157 --> 00:16:46,191
<i>She had been at the Reforma
and then gone.</i>

214
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:48,651
<i>I took the bus south like she did.</i>

215
00:16:48,777 --> 00:16:52,822
<i>It was hot in Taxco.
You say to yourself, "How hot can it get?"</i>

216
00:16:52,874 --> 00:16:55,367
<i>And then in Acapulco, you find out.</i>

217
00:16:55,408 --> 00:16:56,743
<i>She had to wind up here...</i>

218
00:16:56,826 --> 00:16:59,913
<i>... because if you wanna go south,
here's where you get the boat.</i>

219
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:01,790
<i>All I had to do was wait.</i>

220
00:17:02,415 --> 00:17:06,711
<i>Near the plaza was a little caf
called La Mar Azul next to a movie house.</i>

221
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:11,257
<i>I sat there in the
afternoons and drank beer.</i>

222
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:14,678
<i>I used to sit there half-asleep
with a beer and the darkness...</i>

223
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:18,973
<i>... only that music from the movie
next door kept jarring me awake.</i>

224
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:22,800
<i>And then I saw her
coming out of the sun...</i>

225
00:17:22,852 --> 00:17:26,523
<i>... and I knew why Whit didn't
care about that 40 grand.</i>

226
00:17:26,564 --> 00:17:29,526
Cuba Libre, please.

227
00:17:48,837 --> 00:17:52,716
"Senorita, senor," may I speak some words?

228
00:17:52,757 --> 00:17:57,178
- You will be seated, "senor", huh? Yes?
- With pleasure, "senor".

229
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:02,892
I am Jos Rodriguez, a guide,
a most excellent guide.

230
00:18:02,944 --> 00:18:05,061
- Indeed?
- You ask them.

231
00:18:05,186 --> 00:18:08,982
They can tell you that Jos Rodriguez
knows Acapulco as no one else.

232
00:18:09,024 --> 00:18:11,359
- Each little street...
- I don't want a guide.

233
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:15,238
- A very difficult girl.
- Is there one not so, "senor"?

234
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,741
- Perhaps a lottery ticket?
- No.

235
00:18:17,824 --> 00:18:22,454
I have here, wrought
by skilled hands, a ring...

236
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:26,041
...and earrings of jade and pure silver.

237
00:18:26,082 --> 00:18:28,126
These.

238
00:18:34,632 --> 00:18:37,886
- I never wear them.
- Nor I. Please.

239
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:40,055
No, thank you.

240
00:18:40,138 --> 00:18:42,932
My name is Jeff Markham,
and I haven't talked to anybody...

241
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:45,560
...who hasn't tried to sell me
something for 10 days.

242
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,857
If I don't talk, I think. It's too late
in life for me to start thinking.

243
00:18:52,067 --> 00:18:55,393
I could go down to the cliff and look
at the sea like a good tourist.

244
00:18:55,445 --> 00:18:59,532
But it's no good if there isn't somebody
you can turn to and say, "Nice view, huh?"

245
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:03,244
It's the same with the churches,
the relics, the moonlight or a Cuba Libre.

246
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:06,039
Nothing in the world is any good
unless you can share it.

247
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:07,665
Maybe you ought to go home.

248
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:11,711
- Maybe that's why I'm here.
- Is it?

249
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,299
Well, there's always Jos Rodriguez.

250
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:20,011
If it gets too lonely, there's a cantina
down the street called Pablo's.

251
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:24,953
It's nice and quiet. The man there
plays American music for a dollar.

252
00:19:25,005 --> 00:19:29,437
Sip bourbon and shut your eyes.
It's like a little place on 56th Street.

253
00:19:30,146 --> 00:19:31,606
I'll wear my earrings.

254
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:35,819
I sometimes go there.

255
00:19:47,872 --> 00:19:50,750
<i>I went to send a wire to Whit
that I'd found her...</i>

256
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:54,129
<i>... but the telegraph office
was closed for the siesta.</i>

257
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:56,881
<i>I was glad it was,
and I suddenly knew why.</i>

258
00:20:05,265 --> 00:20:07,225
<i>I went to Pablo's that night.</i>

259
00:20:07,308 --> 00:20:09,561
<i>I knew I'd go every night
until she showed up...</i>

260
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:12,272
<i>... and I knew she knew it.</i>

261
00:20:12,772 --> 00:20:15,525
<i>I sat there and drank bourbon,
and I shut my eyes...</i>

262
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:18,611
<i>... but I didn't think
of a joint on 56th Street.</i>

263
00:20:18,653 --> 00:20:24,200
<i>I knew where I was and what I was doing.
I just thought what a sucker I was.</i>

264
00:20:24,252 --> 00:20:27,162
<i>I even knew she wouldn't
come the first night...</i>

265
00:20:27,203 --> 00:20:31,833
<i>... but I sat there, grinding it out.</i>

266
00:20:38,256 --> 00:20:41,467
<i>But the next night I knew she'd show.</i>

267
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,679
<i>She waited until it was late...</i>

268
00:20:44,763 --> 00:20:49,768
<i>... and then she walked in
out of the moonlight, smiling.</i>

269
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:13,375
- Well, this is a coincidence.
- Yes, it is.

270
00:21:14,084 --> 00:21:17,754
- American music.
- You know, I've been here for two nights.

271
00:21:17,796 --> 00:21:21,132
- Thinking?
- No, just waiting.

272
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:23,051
I haven't been lonely.

273
00:21:23,134 --> 00:21:25,887
- Bourbon?
- As you suggested.

274
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:28,139
Thank you, sir.

275
00:21:28,556 --> 00:21:30,433
I've been sitting here for three hours.

276
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:34,437
I thought the guy was gonna
break out with "Melancholy Baby."

277
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:37,732
You know, you're a curious man.

278
00:21:37,816 --> 00:21:40,735
You're gonna make every guy
you meet a little bit curious.

279
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:44,322
That's not what I mean.
You don't ask questions.

280
00:21:44,374 --> 00:21:47,325
You don't even ask me what my name is.

281
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:49,994
All right, what's your name?

282
00:21:50,078 --> 00:21:52,414
Kathie.

283
00:21:52,497 --> 00:21:55,625
- I like it.
- Or where I come from.

284
00:21:55,677 --> 00:21:58,753
I'm thinking about where we're going.

285
00:21:58,837 --> 00:22:02,340
- Don't you like it in here?
- I'm just not ready to settle down.

286
00:22:02,392 --> 00:22:03,883
Shall I take you somewhere else?

287
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:06,386
You're gonna find it very easy
to take me anywhere.

288
00:22:06,511 --> 00:22:11,349
You know, I'm a much better guide
than Jos Rodriguez. Wanna try me?

289
00:22:19,983 --> 00:22:21,818
- That isn't the way to play.
- Why not?

290
00:22:21,901 --> 00:22:24,279
- Because it isn't the way to win.
- Is there a way?

291
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,282
There's a way to lose more slowly.

292
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:32,245
- I prefer it like that.
- Chunk it in.

293
00:22:32,287 --> 00:22:36,416
- Don't you like to gamble?
- Not against a wheel.

294
00:22:37,042 --> 00:22:41,963
- Tell me why you're so hard to please.
- Take me where I can tell you.

295
00:22:42,015 --> 00:22:44,382
All right, come on.

296
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,230
Wait a minute.

297
00:23:33,098 --> 00:23:35,934
When are you taking me back?

298
00:23:37,477 --> 00:23:41,564
- Is that why you kissed me?
- No.

299
00:23:42,065 --> 00:23:44,943
Whit didn't die.

300
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:46,695
- He didn't?
- No.

301
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:49,781
- Then why...
- He just wants you back.

302
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,618
I hate him.

303
00:23:53,743 --> 00:23:58,123
- I'm sorry he didn't die.
- Give him time.

304
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:03,795
- You are taking me back.
- There's no hurry.

305
00:24:03,847 --> 00:24:06,881
I could have run away last night.

306
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:11,428
- I'd find you.
- Yes, I believe you would.

307
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:15,640
Are you glad you did?

308
00:24:15,724 --> 00:24:18,309
I don't know.

309
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,271
I am.

310
00:24:22,105 --> 00:24:25,650
- There was a little business about $40,000.
- I didn't take it.

311
00:24:25,692 --> 00:24:28,403
How'd you know it was taken?

312
00:24:28,486 --> 00:24:31,156
It's what you meant.

313
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:34,826
I don't want anything of his
or any part of him.

314
00:24:35,452 --> 00:24:38,538
- Except his life.
- I didn't know what I was doing.

315
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,125
I didn't know anything,
except how much I hated him.

316
00:24:42,177 --> 00:24:45,587
But I didn't take anything.

317
00:24:45,628 --> 00:24:48,298
I didn't, Jeff.

318
00:24:49,758 --> 00:24:52,135
Won't you believe me?

319
00:24:52,177 --> 00:24:55,138
Baby, I don't care.

320
00:25:01,936 --> 00:25:05,690
<i>I never saw her in the daytime.
We seemed to live by night.</i>

321
00:25:05,732 --> 00:25:09,652
<i>What was left of the day went away
like a pack of cigarettes you smoked.</i>

322
00:25:09,704 --> 00:25:12,364
<i>I didn't know where she lived.
I never followed her.</i>

323
00:25:12,447 --> 00:25:16,232
<i>All I ever had to go on
was a place and time to see her again.</i>

324
00:25:16,284 --> 00:25:19,954
<i>I don't know what we were waiting for.
Maybe we thought the world would end.</i>

325
00:25:20,006 --> 00:25:21,623
<i>Maybe we thought it was a dream...</i>

326
00:25:21,706 --> 00:25:24,209
<i>... and we'd wake up
with a hangover in Niagara Falls.</i>

327
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,669
<i>I wired Whit, but I didn't tell him.</i>

328
00:25:26,753 --> 00:25:29,589
<i>"I'm in Acapulco," I said,
"I wish you were here."</i>

329
00:25:29,672 --> 00:25:32,926
<i>And every night I went to meet her.</i>

330
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:36,262
<i>How did I know she'd ever
show up? I didn't.</i>

331
00:25:36,304 --> 00:25:40,725
<i>What stopped her from taking
a boat to Chile or Guatemala? Nothing.</i>

332
00:25:40,777 --> 00:25:45,689
<i>How big a chump can you get to be?
I was finding out.</i>

333
00:25:46,815 --> 00:25:50,276
<i>And then she'd come along
like school was out...</i>

334
00:25:50,318 --> 00:25:53,780
<i>... and everything else was just
a stone you sailed at the sea.</i>

335
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:57,242
- I didn't know you were so little.
- I'm taller than Napoleon.

336
00:25:57,283 --> 00:25:59,536
You're prettier too.

337
00:26:01,955 --> 00:26:04,708
- Did you miss me?
- No more than I would my eyes.

338
00:26:04,749 --> 00:26:09,504
- Where should we go tonight?
- Let's go to my place.

339
00:26:13,466 --> 00:26:16,960
<i>It was the first time she had
mentioned her place or going there.</i>

340
00:26:17,012 --> 00:26:21,891
<i>Maybe she'd decided something, or it
was because the sky looked full of rain.</i>

341
00:26:35,989 --> 00:26:40,660
<i>It was a nice little joint with bamboo
furniture and Mexican gimcracks.</i>

342
00:26:40,712 --> 00:26:43,455
<i>One little lamp burned. It was all right.</i>

343
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:47,709
<i>And the rain hammering like that
on the window made it good to be in there.</i>

344
00:26:47,751 --> 00:26:49,711
Here.

345
00:26:51,171 --> 00:26:54,132
Hey, hey, not so hard.

346
00:26:59,012 --> 00:27:00,805
- Now yours.
- No, Joe, it's all right.

347
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:03,266
- Oh, come on.
- No, not so hard, Jeff. My earring.

348
00:27:03,308 --> 00:27:07,020
Hush! I'm trying to dry your hair.

349
00:27:29,501 --> 00:27:31,836
- Are you going with me?
- Where?

350
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,714
- Wherever it takes us.
- Why?

351
00:27:34,756 --> 00:27:40,220
To make a life for ourselves,
to get away from Whit. He knows I'm here.

352
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:44,683
- When?
- Tomorrow.

353
00:27:44,724 --> 00:27:48,957
Pack in the morning, meet me
at the hotel if you can make it.

354
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:52,872
- I can make it. Can we get away with it?
- Let's find out.

355
00:27:52,924 --> 00:27:56,736
- You don't know Whit. He won't forget.
- Everybody forgets.

356
00:27:56,778 --> 00:27:58,029
Not Whit.

357
00:27:58,196 --> 00:28:01,533
So we'll send him a postcard
every Christmas.

358
00:28:02,242 --> 00:28:04,369
Jeff, I'm glad you're not afraid of him.

359
00:28:04,452 --> 00:28:07,205
I've been afraid of half
the things I ever did.

360
00:28:07,288 --> 00:28:12,419
- And this time?
- I'm only afraid you might not go.

361
00:28:13,294 --> 00:28:15,755
Don't be.

362
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:18,633
I'll be there tomorrow.

363
00:28:18,717 --> 00:28:21,094
Love me?

364
00:28:21,928 --> 00:28:24,639
- "Poco?"
- What's that?

365
00:28:24,723 --> 00:28:28,143
- A little.
- "Mucho."

366
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:54,826
- Well, the last guy in the world.
- I hate surprises myself.

367
00:28:54,878 --> 00:28:58,840
- You wanna just shut the door and forget it?
- No, no. Come on in.

368
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:03,084
I like surprises. When I was a kid,
we were so busted...

369
00:29:03,136 --> 00:29:06,473
...that if we got anything at all
for Christmas it was a big surprise.

370
00:29:06,514 --> 00:29:09,184
- Sit down, have a chair.
- Thanks.

371
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:11,853
Been here long?

372
00:29:12,354 --> 00:29:15,190
- How long, Joe?
- Hardly at all.

373
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:20,320
I just wondered who might
be following whom.

374
00:29:20,362 --> 00:29:22,989
What makes you think that?

375
00:29:23,073 --> 00:29:26,910
Look, I know how you trust people. About
as far as you can throw Stephanos here.

376
00:29:26,951 --> 00:29:31,414
And that's all right with me,
only let's not get so cute about it.

377
00:29:31,466 --> 00:29:36,419
I'm on my way to Mexico City,
see a man about a horse.

378
00:29:37,003 --> 00:29:41,841
On the level.
A racehorse from South America.

379
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:46,805
- Checking out?
- Sure. Why waste your money?

380
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:51,226
- Did you find her?
- No, only her trail.

381
00:29:51,601 --> 00:29:57,565
Not quite as hot as a prairie fire, but
there. Sometimes a little too obvious.

382
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:01,945
She's a clever little girl.

383
00:30:01,986 --> 00:30:05,407
- Is she?
- Wouldn't you say so?

384
00:30:05,448 --> 00:30:08,326
You should have told me,
I would have played it differently.

385
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,204
Maybe she wouldn't have
heard my shoes squeaking.

386
00:30:11,246 --> 00:30:16,501
Always a hop, skip and a jump ahead of me.
Mexico City to Taxco to here.

387
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:20,364
- And here, Jeff, did you see her?
- No. I wish I had.

388
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:24,175
I don't like playing games
when I'm the fall guy.

389
00:30:24,217 --> 00:30:26,678
You might remember that, Whit.

390
00:30:38,023 --> 00:30:39,983
Thank you.

391
00:30:47,073 --> 00:30:51,745
- Nice shoes. Sporty for you, aren't they?
- Yeah, I got them down here.

392
00:30:51,797 --> 00:30:54,789
As I said before, I thought
maybe the others squeaked.

393
00:30:54,873 --> 00:30:59,294
Let's go down to the bar. You can cool off
while we try to impress each other.

394
00:31:00,503 --> 00:31:02,339
Fine.

395
00:31:06,968 --> 00:31:10,388
Nice place. I'd like to stay here
a while myself.

396
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,016
You did, by proxy.

397
00:31:23,234 --> 00:31:25,820
Something tall and cool,
I don't care what.

398
00:31:25,904 --> 00:31:27,322
- Two.
- Make it three.

399
00:31:27,447 --> 00:31:29,407
Certainly, sir.

400
00:31:29,491 --> 00:31:32,619
- So you blew it.
- Anybody can have bad luck.

401
00:31:32,702 --> 00:31:36,498
- And squeaky shoes.
- Think of a number, Joe.

402
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:40,919
- Where were you off to?
- The telegraph office to wire you.

403
00:31:40,971 --> 00:31:44,214
I told you, I don't like
to spend your money.

404
00:31:44,964 --> 00:31:49,094
- I can stand it.
- Well, it's your business.

405
00:31:49,552 --> 00:31:53,556
Whit, my friend, there's a million dames
in this world, and they all look like her.

406
00:31:53,608 --> 00:31:56,142
No, they don't.

407
00:31:57,435 --> 00:31:59,270
So she was here.

408
00:31:59,354 --> 00:32:02,691
Well, according to all
available evidence, she was.

409
00:32:02,732 --> 00:32:05,318
Maybe I should've sent Stephanos.

410
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,906
- Could you find one dame in a million, Joe?
- A one with 40 grand.

411
00:32:15,328 --> 00:32:16,788
Sorry.

412
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:18,164
You picked up some nerves.

413
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:21,292
I don't need a crack like that
any more than I need your dough.

414
00:32:21,376 --> 00:32:26,589
That's what I've been telling you. I missed
her. The dame caught a boat south.

415
00:32:26,641 --> 00:32:29,801
- Where?
- Look, I got along before this job.

416
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:34,014
I ate good, and I grew as big as you did.
If there's something you don't like, say so.

417
00:32:34,055 --> 00:32:38,341
- I just asked where.
- Chile. Guatemala.

418
00:32:38,393 --> 00:32:42,397
You wanna go see the guy in the steamship
company? You wanna talk to him right now?

419
00:32:42,449 --> 00:32:44,566
Why not?

420
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,870
- Taxi, sir?
- Yeah.

421
00:32:57,203 --> 00:33:00,749
I'm sorry.
You missed her and you feel bad.

422
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:02,292
I shouldn't have joked about it.

423
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:04,169
All right, then I won't either.

424
00:33:04,252 --> 00:33:07,714
You get your 5 grand back
and Stephanos can take over from here.

425
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:09,382
You're wrong.

426
00:33:09,507 --> 00:33:12,385
I fire people, but nobody quits me.

427
00:33:12,427 --> 00:33:14,971
You started this and you'll end it.

428
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:18,641
Besides, Joe couldn't find
a prayer in the Bible.

429
00:33:18,725 --> 00:33:21,061
You'll find her. Take it easy.

430
00:33:21,186 --> 00:33:24,522
Take your time.
Well, better get back to the airport.

431
00:33:24,564 --> 00:33:25,982
Good luck, Jeff.

432
00:33:26,107 --> 00:33:27,859
See you someday.

433
00:33:34,699 --> 00:33:37,535
<i>It wasn't all a lie
because she did take a steamer.</i>

434
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:40,330
<i>It was just that it went north
instead of south.</i>

435
00:33:40,372 --> 00:33:42,540
<i>And I was on it too.</i>

436
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:46,086
I opened an office in San Francisco.

437
00:33:46,878 --> 00:33:49,839
A cheap little rat hole
that suited the work I did.

438
00:33:49,923 --> 00:33:52,884
Shabby jobs for who'd ever hire me.

439
00:33:52,926 --> 00:33:57,722
It was the bottom of the barrel,
and I scraped it, but I didn't care.

440
00:33:58,181 --> 00:34:00,100
I had her.

441
00:34:01,184 --> 00:34:03,019
<i>We kept pretty much to ourselves.</i>

442
00:34:03,103 --> 00:34:05,647
<i>We found a little movie house
in North Beach.</i>

443
00:34:05,689 --> 00:34:09,317
<i>We were on the run. We went to places
we never would've seen in our lives.</i>

444
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,153
<i>And after a while,
we grew a little more sure of ourselves.</i>

445
00:34:12,237 --> 00:34:16,814
<i>We drifted back to more familiar places,
ballparks and the racetracks.</i>

446
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:22,080
<i>Why not? After all, there wasn't one chance
in a million we'd bump into our past.</i>

447
00:34:24,624 --> 00:34:26,376
<i>One chance in a million.</i>

448
00:34:27,377 --> 00:34:31,464
<i>One chance in a million was all that chump
ever had in his life, and he made it good.</i>

449
00:34:31,516 --> 00:34:35,093
<i>He stood there with our lives in his pocket,
because I knew if he saw her...</i>

450
00:34:35,145 --> 00:34:38,013
<i>... he'd sell us both for $ 1.95.</i>

451
00:34:38,221 --> 00:34:40,515
<i>So we had to separate.</i>

452
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,854
<i>I went alone to L.A.,
and I made it easy for him to follow me.</i>

453
00:34:45,895 --> 00:34:49,816
<i>He was a good gumshoe.
It was the one thing he could really do.</i>

454
00:34:50,108 --> 00:34:52,610
<i>So I went everywhere
like a guy enjoying the country.</i>

455
00:34:52,694 --> 00:34:55,447
<i>I didn't write to her or phone or telegraph.</i>

456
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,574
<i>I just waited and moved.</i>

457
00:34:57,741 --> 00:35:01,077
<i>When it seemed right,
I blew out of town to go and meet her.</i>

458
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,457
<i>I wasn't bad at the game myself. I was sure
I had shaken him loose, and I felt good.</i>

459
00:35:12,005 --> 00:35:15,592
<i>Fisher was back there somewhere,
and I could see her again.</i>

460
00:35:16,217 --> 00:35:20,221
<i>We'd arranged to meet at a little cabin
off the highway on Pyramid Creek.</i>

461
00:35:20,273 --> 00:35:22,515
<i>It was dark when I was getting there.</i>

462
00:35:22,557 --> 00:35:25,477
<i>And then I saw her
walking up the road in the headlights.</i>

463
00:35:31,775 --> 00:35:35,570
- You want a lift, babe?
- Well, I really hadn't ought.

464
00:35:37,197 --> 00:35:40,158
You're a cute little package
to be out walking alone at night.

465
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,994
You're kind of cute yourself
to be walking alone any night.

466
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:44,537
That does it.

467
00:35:49,709 --> 00:35:52,921
<i>It was meeting her somewhere,
like in the first times.</i>

468
00:35:53,004 --> 00:35:55,632
<i>There was still that something
about her that got me.</i>

469
00:35:55,715 --> 00:35:58,009
<i>A kind of magic or whatever it was.</i>

470
00:35:58,426 --> 00:36:02,347
<i>Well, I held her, and we could laugh
because we were together again.</i>

471
00:36:02,514 --> 00:36:05,684
<i>We'd played it smart and forgotten nothing.</i>

472
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:08,520
<i>Forgotten nothing except one thing.</i>

473
00:36:18,863 --> 00:36:20,532
<i>He had followed her.</i>

474
00:36:20,657 --> 00:36:22,033
Hello, Jeff.

475
00:36:31,918 --> 00:36:33,712
Don't I get introduced?

476
00:36:36,297 --> 00:36:38,508
I don't blame you, Jeff.

477
00:36:38,758 --> 00:36:41,511
Maybe I'd have lied
my head off just like you did.

478
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:44,889
Your picture don't do you justice, baby.

479
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,102
- Why don't you break his head, Jeff?
- Cute.

480
00:36:49,185 --> 00:36:52,751
Whit should've got her back.
As I understand, they deserve each other.

481
00:36:52,803 --> 00:36:56,317
- You working for him now?
- Who else would he get to find my partner?

482
00:36:56,369 --> 00:36:58,611
All right, Fisher, what's the pitch?

483
00:36:58,987 --> 00:37:01,614
You and I had a little deal, Jeff.

484
00:37:01,698 --> 00:37:04,993
Ten grand and expenses, 50/50.

485
00:37:05,035 --> 00:37:08,496
Remember? You used to have a good
memory. Whatever happened to it?

486
00:37:08,538 --> 00:37:10,874
- I didn't collect.
- Not the 10 grand.

487
00:37:10,957 --> 00:37:15,086
I can give you a tip. You tell Whit where
we are, he might slip you a sawbuck.

488
00:37:15,138 --> 00:37:16,463
Jeff.

489
00:37:16,755 --> 00:37:18,715
He isn't going to tell Whit anything.

490
00:37:18,798 --> 00:37:22,990
Sure not. You just come up with that
40 grand, and we're all pals again.

491
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:27,182
- I might even cut you in for a piece of it.
- There isn't any 40 grand.

492
00:37:27,223 --> 00:37:29,184
Of course Whit's broad-minded.

493
00:37:29,267 --> 00:37:31,603
He don't care about a few slugs
in the stomach...

494
00:37:31,644 --> 00:37:33,772
...or the 40 grand the dame went off with...

495
00:37:34,147 --> 00:37:36,816
...or even Jeff pretending
he fell down on the job.

496
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,654
But you and Jeff ganging up together,
he might not like that.

497
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:43,865
Tell him, Kathie.

498
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:46,242
Sure, I shot him.

499
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,119
I'm not sorry about that.

500
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,121
But I didn't take his money.

501
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:53,666
- Beat it.
- Look at all the angles.

502
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:56,419
You know Whit and you know
how far he can reach.

503
00:37:56,461 --> 00:38:00,131
So just pay me off
and I'm quiet, but use cash.

504
00:38:00,173 --> 00:38:04,344
Don't try to pay me off with pitch handed
to you by this cheap piece of baggage.

505
00:38:05,428 --> 00:38:07,389
I was hoping you'd do this.

506
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,887
- You didn't have to kill him.
- Yes, I did.

507
00:38:48,555 --> 00:38:52,183
You wouldn't have killed him. You would've
beaten him up and thrown him out.

508
00:38:52,235 --> 00:38:55,186
- You didn't have to do it.
- You wouldn't have killed him.

509
00:38:56,396 --> 00:38:59,399
He'd have been against us,
gone to Whit.

510
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:39,481
I buried him up there.

511
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:42,317
I wasn't sorry for him or sore at her.

512
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,069
I wasn't anything.

513
00:39:45,445 --> 00:39:48,365
- Did you ever see her again?
- No.

514
00:39:49,157 --> 00:39:51,117
Did you want to?

515
00:39:52,035 --> 00:39:53,703
No.

516
00:40:03,588 --> 00:40:05,674
Well, I told you it wasn't a nice story.

517
00:40:05,757 --> 00:40:08,259
And I said once that whatever had
happened was done.

518
00:40:08,426 --> 00:40:10,887
Yeah, but you should've known
about it long ago.

519
00:40:10,929 --> 00:40:13,473
It's all right. I understand.

520
00:40:13,556 --> 00:40:15,266
And it's all past.

521
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,893
Maybe it isn't.

522
00:40:16,976 --> 00:40:19,312
- What'll happen?
- I don't know.

523
00:40:19,396 --> 00:40:22,273
It's been a long time.
I don't know how much he knows.

524
00:40:22,315 --> 00:40:23,608
Don't go, Jeff.

525
00:40:23,692 --> 00:40:27,987
I've got to. I'm tired of running.
I gotta clean this up some way.

526
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:29,864
Just one thing, Ann.

527
00:40:29,948 --> 00:40:31,449
Do you want me to come back?

528
00:40:31,533 --> 00:40:33,159
Of course.

529
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:41,584
Put that in your pocket.

530
00:41:15,827 --> 00:41:17,746
Look who's here.

531
00:41:20,457 --> 00:41:22,751
Hello, Markham.
Glad to see you again.

532
00:41:22,876 --> 00:41:24,836
I always wondered if you missed me.

533
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:27,464
Same guy. Time-proof, weatherproof.

534
00:41:27,505 --> 00:41:29,716
- Cigarette?
- Smoking.

535
00:41:35,055 --> 00:41:36,848
- Thanks. Had breakfast?
- No.

536
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:39,309
Joe, tell the boy we have a guest.

537
00:41:39,392 --> 00:41:42,562
Say, I understand you're operating
a little gasoline station.

538
00:41:42,604 --> 00:41:45,315
- You say it like it's hard to understand.
- Well, it is.

539
00:41:45,398 --> 00:41:48,568
It's very simple. I sell gasoline.
I make a small profit.

540
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,738
With that I buy groceries,
the grocer makes a profit.

541
00:41:51,821 --> 00:41:55,408
They call it earning a living.
You may have heard of it somewhere.

542
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:58,693
I may have, but it wasn't from you.

543
00:41:58,745 --> 00:42:01,456
- I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, Whit.
- My feelings?

544
00:42:01,498 --> 00:42:05,043
Ten years ago, I hid them somewhere
and I haven't been able to find them.

545
00:42:05,126 --> 00:42:06,753
Where did you look?

546
00:42:06,836 --> 00:42:08,838
In my pocketbook.

547
00:42:10,215 --> 00:42:11,508
Nice, isn't it?

548
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:14,469
Yeah, it must have set you back
a few shells.

549
00:42:15,345 --> 00:42:17,764
Always worrying about my expenses.

550
00:42:17,847 --> 00:42:19,891
It's a nice view.
Am I here to admire it?

551
00:42:19,974 --> 00:42:21,601
Not exactly.

552
00:42:22,185 --> 00:42:23,853
I need your help.

553
00:42:23,978 --> 00:42:25,397
Like old times.

554
00:42:25,522 --> 00:42:27,774
I always liked you.

555
00:42:28,149 --> 00:42:31,778
You liked me because you could use me.
You could use me because I was smart.

556
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,905
I'm not smart anymore.
I run a gas station.

557
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,699
I like the view.

558
00:42:35,782 --> 00:42:37,575
Can you still listen?

559
00:42:37,701 --> 00:42:39,244
I can hear.

560
00:42:39,452 --> 00:42:41,329
Well, you told me about your business.

561
00:42:41,413 --> 00:42:45,417
Well, mine is a little more precarious,
and I earn considerably more.

562
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:46,668
So I've heard.

563
00:42:46,793 --> 00:42:48,586
So has the government.

564
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:51,715
Well, this may sound ridiculous,
but you could pay them.

565
00:42:51,756 --> 00:42:54,759
- That would be against my nature.
- All right, forget I said it.

566
00:42:54,843 --> 00:42:59,431
So I collaborated with a certain man
who understands these things.

567
00:42:59,483 --> 00:43:01,725
He saved me quite a bit of money,
$ 1 million.

568
00:43:01,808 --> 00:43:06,438
I didn't particularly trust him,
so I paid him well, but he's unhappy.

569
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:09,274
- He wants more money.
- Well, he saved you a lot.

570
00:43:09,315 --> 00:43:13,194
Oh, I appreciate it. I always remember
what any man did for me.

571
00:43:13,246 --> 00:43:14,529
Or didn't.

572
00:43:14,654 --> 00:43:18,690
Perhaps. The point is that
now he wants 200,000.

573
00:43:18,742 --> 00:43:22,704
Or he could get 10 percent of the million
from the government, if he turns you in.

574
00:43:22,756 --> 00:43:24,581
You're up on these things.

575
00:43:24,664 --> 00:43:28,449
- Has he got anything to trade?
- Well, he has the income tax records.

576
00:43:28,501 --> 00:43:32,672
But I don't see why I should buy them
when I might persuade you to get them.

577
00:43:32,724 --> 00:43:34,466
- Then I'd have them.
- I know.

578
00:43:34,549 --> 00:43:36,092
But I can trust you.

579
00:43:36,176 --> 00:43:38,636
You know, I don't think
you can trust anybody.

580
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,181
You better go in there
and get them yourself.

581
00:43:41,222 --> 00:43:43,808
- I'd rather you did it.
- I pass.

582
00:43:43,892 --> 00:43:45,143
You don't like it?

583
00:43:45,268 --> 00:43:47,979
No, I just can't get away
from my business.

584
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:50,398
Well, it's a nice view.

585
00:43:50,482 --> 00:43:52,400
Let's have some breakfast.

586
00:43:59,491 --> 00:44:01,826
You remember Kathie, don't you?

587
00:44:04,162 --> 00:44:06,247
Yeah, I remember Kathie.

588
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:09,918
Sit down.

589
00:44:10,085 --> 00:44:12,879
Kathie's back in the fold now.

590
00:44:12,962 --> 00:44:16,424
- You're back in the fold too, Jeff.
- I see what you mean.

591
00:44:16,466 --> 00:44:18,802
You see, Jeff, you owe me something.

592
00:44:18,885 --> 00:44:21,221
You'll never be happy
until you square yourself.

593
00:44:21,513 --> 00:44:24,265
Did you bare your heart to him, Kathie?

594
00:44:24,891 --> 00:44:26,434
I couldn't help it, Jeff.

595
00:44:28,103 --> 00:44:30,980
- Well, that settles things.
- Does it?

596
00:44:31,022 --> 00:44:32,649
You're working for me.

597
00:44:32,899 --> 00:44:35,610
This man I told you about,
his name is Leonard Eels...

598
00:44:35,652 --> 00:44:37,487
...but you won't go to him directly.

599
00:44:37,612 --> 00:44:40,073
He has a secretary
that he's rather fond of.

600
00:44:40,115 --> 00:44:43,159
Her name is Meta Carson.
You'll find her charming.

601
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:45,161
She may even find you charming.

602
00:44:45,453 --> 00:44:47,747
I understand that women have.

603
00:44:47,789 --> 00:44:50,000
She'll tell you how it's lined up.

604
00:44:51,126 --> 00:44:53,920
You know San Francisco, don't you?

605
00:44:54,838 --> 00:44:57,173
Yeah, I was there once at a party.

606
00:44:57,257 --> 00:44:59,843
- Then you get around.
- Like the monkey and the weasel.

607
00:45:00,844 --> 00:45:03,096
We'll put you on a train this afternoon.

608
00:45:03,763 --> 00:45:07,934
- Right now, I'd like to get some sleep.
- Find Joe. He'll show you to your room.

609
00:45:08,727 --> 00:45:11,396
And don't start worrying.

610
00:45:11,438 --> 00:45:13,231
Why should I?

611
00:45:35,503 --> 00:45:39,174
Jeff, I had to come back.
What else could I do?

612
00:45:39,716 --> 00:45:41,885
You can never help anything, can you?

613
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:46,348
You're like a leaf that the wind blows
from one gutter to another.

614
00:45:46,931 --> 00:45:49,809
You can't help anything you do,
even murder.

615
00:45:49,893 --> 00:45:53,146
- You can't say it was that.
- I can say one thing. I buried him.

616
00:45:53,198 --> 00:45:56,441
What did you tell him? About us?

617
00:45:58,651 --> 00:46:02,530
- But you couldn't help it, could you?
- He looked right into me and he knew it.

618
00:46:02,572 --> 00:46:04,491
- How much?
- What, Jeff?

619
00:46:04,574 --> 00:46:06,951
About Fisher.
Did he look into you for that too?

620
00:46:06,993 --> 00:46:09,037
No, I didn't tell that.

621
00:46:10,163 --> 00:46:11,790
- Don't lie to me.
- I didn't.

622
00:46:11,873 --> 00:46:14,918
I wouldn't tell him that.
I wouldn't tell anyone that.

623
00:46:14,959 --> 00:46:17,087
I swear it, Jeff. Believe me.

624
00:46:17,212 --> 00:46:19,297
Sure. Sure, I believe you.

625
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:21,299
I didn't know what to do.

626
00:46:21,383 --> 00:46:24,177
I was always afraid of him
and afraid of what I'd done.

627
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:27,263
I couldn't live that way anymore.
I couldn't stand it.

628
00:46:27,315 --> 00:46:29,265
Oh, Jeff, I've missed you.

629
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:32,852
I've wondered about you
and prayed you'd understand.

630
00:46:32,936 --> 00:46:34,229
Can you understand?

631
00:46:34,354 --> 00:46:35,939
You prayed, Kathie?

632
00:46:36,147 --> 00:46:38,233
Can't you even feel sorry for me?

633
00:46:38,441 --> 00:46:40,902
- I'm not going to try.
- Jeff...

634
00:46:40,985 --> 00:46:44,155
Look, just get out, will you?
I have to sleep in this room.

635
00:46:47,117 --> 00:46:50,537
Let's just leave it where it all is.
Get out.

636
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:39,419
- Meta Carson?
- Yes.

637
00:47:39,544 --> 00:47:42,464
- My name is Bailey.
- Come in.

638
00:47:45,383 --> 00:47:48,543
- I was expecting you.
- Well, I wasn't expecting you.

639
00:47:48,595 --> 00:47:51,931
- Should I take that as a compliment?
- Whit told me you'd be charming.

640
00:47:52,015 --> 00:47:54,267
Really? Would you like a gin and tonic?

641
00:47:54,351 --> 00:47:56,853
- That'd be nice.
- You may have whiskey, if you like.

642
00:47:56,936 --> 00:47:59,064
That'd be even nicer.

643
00:48:02,484 --> 00:48:05,320
Miserable weather we're having,
isn't it?

644
00:48:06,112 --> 00:48:10,325
- Are you acquainted with San Francisco?
- We were quite intimate.

645
00:48:10,533 --> 00:48:13,370
- Indeed?
- We lived together.

646
00:48:13,411 --> 00:48:15,205
It's a nice apartment you have here.

647
00:48:15,288 --> 00:48:18,792
Yes, these old houses can be amusing
when they're remodeled, can't they?

648
00:48:18,844 --> 00:48:21,336
I used to live in one
in New York that was old.

649
00:48:21,419 --> 00:48:23,004
It wasn't very amusing.

650
00:48:23,088 --> 00:48:26,716
- I've never been to New York.
- You take a trip there sometime.

651
00:48:26,758 --> 00:48:29,636
You'll see one reason
why I'm in San Francisco.

652
00:48:29,678 --> 00:48:31,388
Whit said you'd tell me the other.

653
00:48:31,471 --> 00:48:35,684
You know, you're rather charming yourself,
but I'm afraid I don't quite understand you.

654
00:48:35,736 --> 00:48:37,769
If you'll drop this Junior League patter...

655
00:48:37,894 --> 00:48:40,397
...we may get the conversation
down where it belongs.

656
00:48:40,897 --> 00:48:44,109
- You worried about something?
- I don't know. Should I be?

657
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:48,279
- Not if you do what you're told.
- That's why I'm here. I do what I'm told.

658
00:48:48,331 --> 00:48:52,325
People trust me.
Whit even trusts me twice. Do you?

659
00:48:52,367 --> 00:48:54,786
Just as far as I have to.

660
00:48:55,286 --> 00:48:58,623
Can you find your way
to 114 Fulton Street?

661
00:48:58,665 --> 00:49:00,542
- When?
- Tonight.

662
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:04,045
I'll be there in the apartment
of an attorney named Leonard Eels.

663
00:49:04,097 --> 00:49:06,673
You can call for me at 8
and look around.

664
00:49:06,715 --> 00:49:10,051
I can depend on that.
We'll leave together.

665
00:49:10,093 --> 00:49:12,512
In a day or so,
he'll take some papers home.

666
00:49:12,554 --> 00:49:13,972
I'll let you know.

667
00:49:14,097 --> 00:49:16,391
Then you get them.
He won't be there.

668
00:49:16,433 --> 00:49:17,767
Where will he be?

669
00:49:17,934 --> 00:49:21,386
With me. I'm his secretary.

670
00:49:21,438 --> 00:49:24,774
- Well, it sounds simple enough.
- It is.

671
00:49:24,858 --> 00:49:27,986
- Like two and two make four.
- That's right.

672
00:49:32,157 --> 00:49:35,952
Just remember, I'm coming out of this
in one piece, Miss Carson.

673
00:49:36,244 --> 00:49:39,789
Do you always go around leaving
your fingerprints on a girl's shoulder?

674
00:49:39,873 --> 00:49:44,836
Not that I mind particularly.
You've got nice strong hands.

675
00:50:00,685 --> 00:50:02,437
- Jeff.
- Petey, how are you?

676
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,481
Where you been?
You marry an honest dame?

677
00:50:04,564 --> 00:50:08,193
- I went in the gasoline business.
- But you're looking for me now, ain't you?

678
00:50:08,234 --> 00:50:11,654
I went out of business.
Come on, let's take a ride in your hack.

679
00:50:15,658 --> 00:50:17,827
Buddy, you look like you're in trouble.

680
00:50:17,911 --> 00:50:20,997
- Why?
- Because you don't act like it.

681
00:50:21,331 --> 00:50:23,708
I think I'm in a frame.

682
00:50:24,125 --> 00:50:25,919
Don't sound like you.

683
00:50:26,002 --> 00:50:28,463
I don't know.
All I can see is the frame.

684
00:50:28,588 --> 00:50:30,840
I'm going in there now
to look at the picture.

685
00:50:30,882 --> 00:50:34,552
- I don't have to tell you to wait.
- You don't have to tell me nothing.

686
00:51:04,165 --> 00:51:05,458
My name is Jeff Bailey.

687
00:51:05,583 --> 00:51:08,545
Oh, yes, Miss Carson said
you'd pick her up. I'm Leonard Eels.

688
00:51:08,628 --> 00:51:11,256
- How do you do?
- Bring him out here, Leonard.

689
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:19,305
Thank you.

690
00:51:19,431 --> 00:51:21,099
Hello, Jeffrey.

691
00:51:21,224 --> 00:51:24,102
I always wanted my favorite cousin
to meet my favorite boss.

692
00:51:24,144 --> 00:51:26,146
- Apple martini?
- Thanks.

693
00:51:26,229 --> 00:51:29,274
Meta talked about you like
you're the ninth wonder of the world.

694
00:51:29,357 --> 00:51:31,526
- She skipped one.
- Meta must be the eighth.

695
00:51:31,568 --> 00:51:35,530
All women are wonders because
they reduce all men to the obvious.

696
00:51:35,572 --> 00:51:37,615
And so do martinis.

697
00:51:38,658 --> 00:51:40,785
So nice here, I hate to go.

698
00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:43,621
Don't then. Why don't you both stay
and have dinner?

699
00:51:43,955 --> 00:51:45,248
Yes, why don't we?

700
00:51:45,373 --> 00:51:48,376
We can't, Jeffrey.
We promised the Bigelows, remember?

701
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,670
Oh, call them up.
We can see them anytime.

702
00:51:50,754 --> 00:51:52,839
We can't, Jeffrey. I'm sorry, Leonard.

703
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:55,800
Some other time.
How long will you be in town, Mr. Bailey?

704
00:51:56,343 --> 00:51:59,220
- I don't really know.
- You're on business?

705
00:51:59,304 --> 00:52:02,390
- You might call it that.
- Where are you from? The South?

706
00:52:03,058 --> 00:52:07,228
- No. Tahoe.
- We must go, Jeff.

707
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,022
All right.

708
00:52:12,067 --> 00:52:15,111
Your cousin is a very charming young lady.

709
00:52:15,153 --> 00:52:19,324
No, he isn't. His name is Norman
and he's a bookmaker in Cleveland, Ohio.

710
00:52:21,743 --> 00:52:24,329
- Where did you say you were from?
- Tahoe...

711
00:52:24,371 --> 00:52:27,540
...where we worry as much
about the income tax as anybody.

712
00:52:29,084 --> 00:52:30,752
Frankly, you don't make sense.

713
00:52:30,919 --> 00:52:33,171
Neither does my being her cousin...

714
00:52:33,254 --> 00:52:35,590
...or my being brought up here...

715
00:52:35,715 --> 00:52:37,717
...to leave my fingerprints around.

716
00:52:37,801 --> 00:52:39,844
On the other hand, maybe it does.

717
00:52:39,886 --> 00:52:42,972
You know, it could be that I'm the patsy,
and you're on the spot.

718
00:52:43,014 --> 00:52:45,600
- Coming, Jeff?
- Right away.

719
00:52:45,642 --> 00:52:48,687
Keep the martinis dry, I'll be back.

720
00:52:53,858 --> 00:52:56,236
I'm glad you could come, both of you.

721
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,697
- Mr. Eels, you make a great martini.
- Thank you.

722
00:52:58,738 --> 00:53:00,031
- Good night.
- Good night.

723
00:53:00,156 --> 00:53:02,617
- Good night, Leonard.
- Good night.

724
00:53:09,332 --> 00:53:12,252
For a man who appears to be clever,
you can act like an idiot.

725
00:53:12,335 --> 00:53:15,547
That's one way to be clever:
Look like an idiot.

726
00:53:16,798 --> 00:53:19,926
He looked like an underweight ghost.
What did you say to him?

727
00:53:19,968 --> 00:53:21,845
I told him he made a great martini.

728
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:24,097
- You are an idiot.
- So is he.

729
00:53:24,222 --> 00:53:27,809
- You think so?
- Why not? He's in love with you.

730
00:53:32,647 --> 00:53:34,983
Mason Building.

731
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:43,199
Doesn't your conscience bother you,
crossing a nice guy like that?

732
00:53:43,241 --> 00:53:45,118
Maybe he isn't such a nice guy.

733
00:53:45,201 --> 00:53:47,162
Maybe he crosses people too.

734
00:53:54,169 --> 00:53:57,005
- Do I go alone?
- No, you go back to your hotel and wait.

735
00:53:57,047 --> 00:53:59,090
Yes, ma'am.

736
00:54:02,844 --> 00:54:06,973
- Nice.
- Awfully cold around the heart. Let's go.

737
00:54:07,015 --> 00:54:08,558
Hold it.

738
00:54:08,683 --> 00:54:11,478
Drive around the block
and stop right here.

739
00:54:59,025 --> 00:55:02,862
Follow her, Petey, then wait for me
at Eels' apartment house.

740
00:57:47,819 --> 00:57:50,196
- I lost her.
- She's worth losing.

741
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:54,451
I jumped a signal and I got stopped
by a gabby cop.

742
00:57:54,503 --> 00:57:57,078
Here. You finish it.

743
00:57:57,871 --> 00:57:59,873
- Shall I pick up her hack?
- No.

744
00:57:59,956 --> 00:58:02,917
- Where to?
- Telegraph Hill.

745
00:58:02,959 --> 00:58:04,586
Did you have some bad luck?

746
00:58:04,711 --> 00:58:07,922
Yeah. My timing was a few minutes off.

747
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,056
- "Hello?"
- Mr. Tillotson.

748
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,600
- "Yes."
- This is Mr. Eels' secretary.

749
00:59:42,726 --> 00:59:44,436
I'm worried about Mr. Eels.

750
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:46,980
I know he's home,
but he doesn't answer his phone.

751
00:59:47,022 --> 00:59:49,607
- Would you see if he's all right?
- "Maybe he went out."

752
00:59:49,691 --> 00:59:51,484
No, he was to wait for my call.

753
00:59:51,568 --> 00:59:56,072
I don't want to be a nuisance,
but I'm sure he's there and I'm worried.

754
00:59:56,124 --> 00:59:58,408
- Would you call me right back?
- "Yes".

755
00:59:58,491 --> 01:00:00,827
Fillmore 0710.

756
01:00:00,869 --> 01:00:04,205
- Yes, Miss Carson. Right away.
- "Thank you."

757
01:00:37,989 --> 01:00:40,116
- Yes?
- "He isn't there."

758
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:41,868
He isn't?

759
01:00:42,243 --> 01:00:44,079
- Did you go in the apartment?
- "Yes."

760
01:00:44,162 --> 01:00:46,498
But he must be there.

761
01:00:46,873 --> 01:00:48,583
Thank you.

762
01:01:00,345 --> 01:01:02,597
- "Hello?"
- Joe Stephanos, please.

763
01:01:02,681 --> 01:01:03,973
<i>He isn't here.</i>

764
01:01:04,099 --> 01:01:07,727
Then leave word for him to call
Miss Carson's apartment right away.

765
01:01:12,857 --> 01:01:14,359
Was there a slip-up, baby?

766
01:01:18,238 --> 01:01:20,949
Did you send your friend up there
to find Eels dead?

767
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:23,785
- No, Jeff.
- Tell me.

768
01:01:24,703 --> 01:01:25,954
- Tell me.
- Don't, Jeff.

769
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:27,914
- Don't what?
- I don't want to die.

770
01:01:27,998 --> 01:01:31,126
Neither do I, baby.
But if I have to, I'm gonna die last.

771
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:32,711
Something slipped up, didn't it?

772
01:01:32,794 --> 01:01:36,089
They told you they'd knock him off,
and haven't done it, have they?

773
01:01:36,131 --> 01:01:39,134
They haven't because I tipped him off.
He blew.

774
01:01:39,217 --> 01:01:41,261
- He's all right?
- Didn't you want him to be?

775
01:01:41,386 --> 01:01:44,931
Yes. Yes, because if he dies,
they'll say you did it.

776
01:01:45,098 --> 01:01:47,809
Oh, you're wonderful, Kathie.
You're magnificent.

777
01:01:47,892 --> 01:01:52,147
- You can change sides so smoothly.
- Don't, Jeff. You're hurting me.

778
01:01:53,148 --> 01:01:54,941
I'm almost getting it.

779
01:01:55,066 --> 01:01:56,776
Very pretty.

780
01:01:56,943 --> 01:02:00,196
Whit wants Eels out of the picture
and to square an account with me.

781
01:02:00,248 --> 01:02:02,949
Two birds together.
So I come to town with an address.

782
01:02:02,991 --> 01:02:05,785
A redhead takes me up to visit
the chump who has to go.

783
01:02:05,827 --> 01:02:08,163
I have a drink, leave my prints around.

784
01:02:08,246 --> 01:02:10,123
I leave and somebody gets him.

785
01:02:10,206 --> 01:02:12,584
Eels dies and the tax papers...

786
01:02:12,667 --> 01:02:15,503
...they were in the briefcase
that Meta took, weren't they?

787
01:02:15,545 --> 01:02:18,340
The papers go back to Whit.
I'm the fall guy.

788
01:02:18,423 --> 01:02:20,008
There's only one thing missing:

789
01:02:20,091 --> 01:02:21,551
The plant.

790
01:02:21,634 --> 01:02:25,764
What was there to give me a motive?
I wouldn't kill a guy for a martini.

791
01:02:25,816 --> 01:02:27,599
- Tell me, Kathie.
- They made me sign it.

792
01:02:27,724 --> 01:02:29,351
- Sign what?
- An affidavit.

793
01:02:29,476 --> 01:02:31,269
- Go on.
- I couldn't help it, Jeff.

794
01:02:31,353 --> 01:02:34,189
They made me sign it.
I swear I couldn't help it.

795
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:37,275
They said they'd find the body
and tell the police I killed him.

796
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:40,153
Fisher. Then you did tell them about Fisher.

797
01:02:40,195 --> 01:02:42,197
Only you told them I did it.

798
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,823
Perfect.

799
01:02:44,366 --> 01:02:46,242
Foolproof and beautiful.

800
01:02:46,326 --> 01:02:48,036
That Whit can really hate, can't he?

801
01:02:48,161 --> 01:02:50,288
You said it once, he can remember.

802
01:02:50,413 --> 01:02:52,624
I never stopped hating him, Jeff.

803
01:02:52,707 --> 01:02:55,168
I couldn't help myself. I was caught too.

804
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:57,337
We don't have to be against
each other now.

805
01:02:57,462 --> 01:02:59,673
- Aren't we?
- No. We can break out of it.

806
01:02:59,714 --> 01:03:01,341
All we need is the briefcase.

807
01:03:01,508 --> 01:03:05,136
Then we've got them, Jeff.
We can get anything we want from them.

808
01:03:05,188 --> 01:03:06,971
I'd like that affidavit you signed.

809
01:03:07,055 --> 01:03:09,724
We can get it. It's in Eels' office safe.

810
01:03:09,766 --> 01:03:13,353
We can make Meta get it.
We can make them do anything.

811
01:03:13,405 --> 01:03:14,979
Sure.

812
01:03:15,105 --> 01:03:16,439
Oh, Jeff...

813
01:03:16,564 --> 01:03:18,858
You ought to have killed me
for what I did.

814
01:03:18,983 --> 01:03:21,548
- There's time.
- No. You won't.

815
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,114
I've never stopped loving you.

816
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:27,367
I was afraid and no good,
but I never stopped...

817
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:29,494
...even if you hated me.

818
01:03:29,577 --> 01:03:30,870
Did you?

819
01:03:30,954 --> 01:03:34,499
- Yes.
- But you don't now.

820
01:03:36,126 --> 01:03:37,794
No.

821
01:03:38,503 --> 01:03:40,255
We can be together again.

822
01:03:40,338 --> 01:03:43,570
In a way we never were.
We can go back to Acapulco...

823
01:03:43,622 --> 01:03:46,803
...and start all over
as though nothing had happened.

824
01:03:46,845 --> 01:03:48,638
Yes.

825
01:03:54,436 --> 01:03:56,855
How do we get the briefcase?

826
01:03:56,938 --> 01:03:58,481
Whit owns a club.

827
01:03:58,606 --> 01:04:00,567
The Sterling Club on North Beach.

828
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:03,945
Meta took it there
to a man named Baylord.

829
01:04:03,987 --> 01:04:05,739
I might get by with it.

830
01:04:05,864 --> 01:04:07,907
You will, darling.

831
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:10,243
Hurry.

832
01:04:31,848 --> 01:04:33,266
What happened to you?

833
01:04:33,391 --> 01:04:36,061
I went to a bar and bought a double.
I must be slipping.

834
01:04:36,102 --> 01:04:38,021
I guess you must be.

835
01:04:38,104 --> 01:04:42,984
He just stood there shaking so hard
he couldn't even pray.

836
01:04:43,036 --> 01:04:46,279
I never saw anyone so afraid to die.

837
01:04:46,321 --> 01:04:48,656
- I didn't like it.
- You killed him?

838
01:04:49,949 --> 01:04:51,701
Certainly.

839
01:04:52,285 --> 01:04:56,164
But I called. A man went up and looked
in the apartment and he wasn't there.

840
01:04:56,539 --> 01:05:00,033
- Eels?
- Yes, Eels. He wasn't there.

841
01:05:00,085 --> 01:05:03,004
I was there. And the way I left him,
he didn't walk away.

842
01:05:04,464 --> 01:05:07,008
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

843
01:05:08,218 --> 01:05:10,595
I do. Where's Bailey?

844
01:05:55,098 --> 01:05:56,975
What do you want?

845
01:06:01,021 --> 01:06:03,023
- Yeah?
- "Mr. Baylord, a man just went up..."

846
01:06:03,106 --> 01:06:05,817
- "...heading toward your office."
- Forget it.

847
01:06:39,601 --> 01:06:43,229
- You wanted to see somebody?
- I just saw him. Thanks.

848
01:07:10,173 --> 01:07:12,676
- You know that hack driver?
- Yeah, I think so.

849
01:07:12,759 --> 01:07:14,761
- Rafferty.
- Yeah?

850
01:07:14,844 --> 01:07:17,931
Get Joe. Bring back that guy
any way you have to.

851
01:07:18,014 --> 01:07:21,184
- Just so that briefcase comes with him.
- Right.

852
01:07:23,478 --> 01:07:24,557
All arranged, sir.

853
01:07:24,558 --> 01:07:27,315
Twenty for you, the
rest for transportation.

854
01:07:27,367 --> 01:07:30,151
Have the boy meet me
at the airport with the ticket.

855
01:07:30,193 --> 01:07:34,280
- Thank you, sir.
- You know, a bad memory is like an ill wind.

856
01:07:34,332 --> 01:07:38,368
- It can blow somebody luck.
- I always say everybody's right.

857
01:07:46,334 --> 01:07:48,420
After you.

858
01:07:50,755 --> 01:07:52,882
- You won't need this.
- I couldn't do nothing.

859
01:07:52,924 --> 01:07:54,634
You can now. Start moving.

860
01:07:54,759 --> 01:07:59,222
- I sure get into a lot of trouble, don't I?
- You shouldn't steal so much.

861
01:08:10,108 --> 01:08:12,360
Well, we meet in all kinds of places.

862
01:08:18,658 --> 01:08:21,411
That evens this. Fold your hands,
or I'll do it for you.

863
01:08:21,453 --> 01:08:23,705
You talk big, mister.

864
01:08:34,507 --> 01:08:36,092
- All right, wise guy.
- I wouldn't.

865
01:08:36,176 --> 01:08:38,386
I told you. I'm tired
of getting pushed around.

866
01:08:38,511 --> 01:08:41,598
You'll only get yourself out of breath.
Won't he, Joe?

867
01:08:41,639 --> 01:08:43,141
Cut it, Lou.

868
01:08:43,224 --> 01:08:46,478
Your move now is to do a little thinking.
A little talking.

869
01:08:46,561 --> 01:08:49,460
See, I've got the files
that were in your briefcase.

870
01:08:49,512 --> 01:08:52,359
I also know the address
of the Treasury Department.

871
01:08:52,442 --> 01:08:55,945
That's the theory, isn't it?
Keep the files away from the treasury boys.

872
01:08:55,997 --> 01:08:58,323
Save Whit from doing 10 years
in a federal pen.

873
01:08:58,365 --> 01:09:02,118
- Now, you correct me if I make a mistake.
- We may do that.

874
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:05,862
Sure. Of course, the government
may just pat Whit on the back and say:

875
01:09:05,914 --> 01:09:09,918
"Go on home. We got all the dough we need.
We'll never miss your million dollars."

876
01:09:09,959 --> 01:09:12,337
You wanna lay a price on that?

877
01:09:12,379 --> 01:09:14,255
How did you know I had the briefcase?

878
01:09:15,924 --> 01:09:18,093
I had Meta tailed.

879
01:09:18,176 --> 01:09:21,054
You sure about that?

880
01:09:21,096 --> 01:09:24,683
Look, I don't have to be sure
about anything except the files.

881
01:09:24,724 --> 01:09:28,144
Now, do you wanna talk business,
or do you wanna play house?

882
01:09:28,436 --> 01:09:30,980
What's your idea?

883
01:09:31,022 --> 01:09:34,109
You get the files,
and you also get Eels' body...

884
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:36,486
...in case you wanna
keep it from the cops.

885
01:09:36,611 --> 01:09:38,530
What do you want?

886
01:09:39,197 --> 01:09:43,326
I want the affidavit that Meta put
in Eels' safe when she took the files out.

887
01:09:43,702 --> 01:09:48,248
A lie that somebody put on paper
that I killed a guy named Jack Fisher.

888
01:09:48,665 --> 01:09:50,417
Because, you see, I only buried him.

889
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:53,336
And you don't get the gas
for being the undertaker.

890
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:56,798
Four of us knew about that affidavit
outside of Whit.

891
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,717
Somebody talked.

892
01:10:04,889 --> 01:10:07,809
- Did Meta tell you?
- No.

893
01:10:08,351 --> 01:10:10,311
Sorry.

894
01:10:12,105 --> 01:10:14,566
- Put in a call for Whit Sterling...
- No, sit down.

895
01:10:14,649 --> 01:10:17,767
- We better keep Whit out of this.
- He's right, Kathie.

896
01:10:17,819 --> 01:10:21,656
Oh, you've hurt her feelings, Lou.
I can tell you, she's a sensitive girl.

897
01:10:21,708 --> 01:10:24,701
- I'm kind of sensitive myself.
- And you won't need Whit.

898
01:10:24,784 --> 01:10:28,163
All you'll need is Meta
to unlock that safe in Eels' office.

899
01:10:28,246 --> 01:10:31,082
- I hope Meta's still around.
- She's around.

900
01:10:31,124 --> 01:10:33,710
Good. Then you can start right now.

901
01:10:33,752 --> 01:10:37,839
I'll call you in about an hour. That'll
give you time to find her and get there.

902
01:10:37,881 --> 01:10:41,259
Give you a little extra time to figure out
how you're gonna cross me.

903
01:10:41,311 --> 01:10:43,136
But you won't.

904
01:11:35,021 --> 01:11:36,940
Will you bust this for me, Jackson?

905
01:11:37,023 --> 01:11:38,692
Sure.

906
01:11:41,194 --> 01:11:44,572
That's right. Whit Sterling
at the Blue Sky Club in Reno.

907
01:11:44,614 --> 01:11:48,535
- Shut the door.
- Don't forget, those dames listen in.

908
01:11:53,832 --> 01:11:55,125
- Hello?
- "Mr. Sterling?"

909
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:56,543
- Speaking.
- "One moment."

910
01:11:56,626 --> 01:11:59,379
- Thank you.
- "Go ahead."

911
01:11:59,421 --> 01:12:02,465
- Whit, darling, this is Kathie.
- "Everything all right?"

912
01:12:02,507 --> 01:12:04,467
- No.
- "Seldom is."

913
01:12:04,592 --> 01:12:07,095
I think you'd better stay
where you are for a while.

914
01:12:07,178 --> 01:12:10,140
- Well, could you tell me why?
- "I can't talk now."

915
01:12:10,223 --> 01:12:11,933
<i>Things are mixed up.</i>

916
01:12:12,017 --> 01:12:13,643
Bailey mix them?

917
01:12:13,768 --> 01:12:16,396
<i>I can't talk on the phone.
We're trying to get a plane.</i>

918
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:18,648
But you're bringing me something?

919
01:12:18,732 --> 01:12:23,194
<i>No, Whit. I can't explain now, darling.
I just wanted to tell you.</i>

920
01:12:23,246 --> 01:12:25,822
<i>I don't want anything
to happen to you.</i>

921
01:12:25,905 --> 01:12:28,450
- Like what, honey?
- "Don't go to Tahoe."

922
01:12:28,575 --> 01:12:32,162
<i>Be careful and wait in Reno for me.
Goodbye.</i>

923
01:12:39,836 --> 01:12:43,506
- You look like I might be in trouble.
- You will be if we don't find Bailey.

924
01:12:43,558 --> 01:12:46,092
I might be if I do.

925
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:18,375
"Bridgeport service station operator
sought in San Francisco slaying.

926
01:13:18,416 --> 01:13:21,336
Five-year-old murder motive,
the police say.

927
01:13:21,378 --> 01:13:24,798
Leonard Eels, attorney, was found
murdered in his apartment house...

928
01:13:24,839 --> 01:13:28,541
...114 Fulton Street,
early this morning." Well.

929
01:13:28,593 --> 01:13:32,055
"Jeff Bailey, at one time
private detective and more recently...

930
01:13:32,097 --> 01:13:35,183
...operator of a small gas station
in Bridgeport...

931
01:13:35,266 --> 01:13:39,218
...is hunted for two murders."
- I knew he was no good.

932
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:43,108
I said all along, "There's a man
who should be run out of town."

933
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:47,320
Look at that. Police are hunting him
for two murders.

934
01:13:47,372 --> 01:13:50,365
- I told you, Ann.
- Ann.

935
01:13:50,448 --> 01:13:52,993
Oh, leave me alone.

936
01:14:01,459 --> 01:14:05,046
<i>Cooper reporting. Road is now blocked
20 miles south of Bridgeport.</i>

937
01:14:05,088 --> 01:14:07,465
<i>Checking all cars. That is all.</i>

938
01:14:07,507 --> 01:14:10,635
- Hi, Jim.
- Hello, Ed. You talked to the kid yet?

939
01:14:10,677 --> 01:14:13,013
He's gone. The station's locked up tight.

940
01:14:13,096 --> 01:14:16,516
- Gone where?
- Maybe with Bailey.

941
01:14:16,558 --> 01:14:19,644
Well, that doesn't make sense.
If you had the law on your tail...

942
01:14:19,728 --> 01:14:22,731
...would you let a guy working for you
come up to chew the fat?

943
01:14:22,814 --> 01:14:26,234
I'd want a partner, if I could get him.

944
01:14:27,694 --> 01:14:29,446
- Ed?
- Yeah?

945
01:14:29,529 --> 01:14:31,031
Our attention.

946
01:14:31,114 --> 01:14:34,951
Says, "Bailey took a plane to L.A.
Last night. No trace since."

947
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:36,953
Says, "May be headed this way."

948
01:14:37,037 --> 01:14:38,621
Okay.

949
01:14:38,913 --> 01:14:43,043
Would you consider it too dumb
for him to try to hole up here?

950
01:14:43,209 --> 01:14:45,920
He'll come here.
And when he does, I'll know it.

951
01:14:45,962 --> 01:14:47,922
See you.

952
01:14:52,344 --> 01:14:56,931
- What's he mean, he'll know it?
- What do you suppose? Ann Miller.

953
01:14:56,983 --> 01:15:00,101
Me? I'll take the kid.

954
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:13,615
You all right, Ann?

955
01:15:14,074 --> 01:15:17,452
I know what you're going to say,
and I don't wanna hear it.

956
01:15:17,702 --> 01:15:20,330
Jeff didn't kill anybody.

957
01:15:20,413 --> 01:15:21,998
He told me everything.

958
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:24,793
Has he got you mixed up in this?

959
01:15:25,001 --> 01:15:28,380
- Has he?
- Whatever he's mixed up in, I am too.

960
01:15:28,421 --> 01:15:30,965
Well, I'm not going to stand by
and see him hurt you.

961
01:15:31,049 --> 01:15:33,593
- Lf he comes back here...
- What'll you do?

962
01:15:33,635 --> 01:15:36,388
- You won't go to the police.
- I don't know what I'll do.

963
01:15:36,471 --> 01:15:37,847
No, Jimmy.

964
01:15:37,972 --> 01:15:40,934
Do you expect me to help him get away?

965
01:15:41,935 --> 01:15:43,186
Jim.

966
01:15:50,735 --> 01:15:53,154
He can read your lips.

967
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,659
Mr. Sterling is fishing.

968
01:15:57,784 --> 01:16:00,370
No. In the high mountains.

969
01:16:00,412 --> 01:16:02,747
Tell Jeff we're sending for him.

970
01:16:02,831 --> 01:16:05,125
Where can we reach you?

971
01:16:13,425 --> 01:16:17,012
Joe will find you at the station
when we have word.

972
01:16:27,689 --> 01:16:30,066
I'm not so sure this is a bright idea.

973
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:33,278
You think of a brighter one
on the way, come back with it.

974
01:18:22,595 --> 01:18:25,098
He follow you from Tahoe?

975
01:18:25,181 --> 01:18:27,350
Who'd you see? Sterling?

976
01:18:27,434 --> 01:18:29,352
Kathie?

977
01:18:33,314 --> 01:18:35,734
Cute kids, aren't they?

978
01:19:05,347 --> 01:19:07,807
What are you scared about?

979
01:19:08,141 --> 01:19:12,812
Joe isn't coming back.
He got careless and fell in the river.

980
01:19:13,772 --> 01:19:17,025
Didn't you hear what I said?
Joe's dead, Kathie.

981
01:19:17,067 --> 01:19:19,903
Can't you find some tears for him?

982
01:19:20,654 --> 01:19:23,990
- Come on.
- What are you gonna do?

983
01:19:24,074 --> 01:19:26,201
Talk to Whit.
Don't you think I should?

984
01:19:26,242 --> 01:19:29,954
Yes, of course you should.
He wants to see you. He's waiting for you.

985
01:19:30,006 --> 01:19:32,874
With his fishing rod?
You told the kid he was fishing.

986
01:19:32,916 --> 01:19:35,585
He came back late this afternoon.

987
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:38,254
I'll bet he's pacing up and down,
worrying about Joe.

988
01:19:38,338 --> 01:19:43,124
- You think I sent Joe?
- Oh, you're wonderful, Kathie.

989
01:19:43,176 --> 01:19:47,263
- All right. Where is the gentleman?
- Downstairs. In the library, I think.

990
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:50,100
Jeff, don't let him trick you.

991
01:19:50,141 --> 01:19:52,727
He'll pay anything you ask.
He'll do anything you ask.

992
01:19:52,769 --> 01:19:55,605
Sure he will. Anything.

993
01:20:00,026 --> 01:20:03,154
If only there was some way about Fisher.

994
01:20:03,206 --> 01:20:05,073
There is.

995
01:20:17,377 --> 01:20:20,422
Well, you getting things in shape
for the treasury boys?

996
01:20:20,463 --> 01:20:24,259
Hello, Jeff. I've been sort of
expecting you.

997
01:20:24,676 --> 01:20:28,179
Well, let's get down to business.
Start all over again, right?

998
01:20:28,221 --> 01:20:31,975
- You have some papers of mine.
- All right, you take the frame off me.

999
01:20:32,017 --> 01:20:34,352
You pin the Eels murder on Joe.

1000
01:20:35,854 --> 01:20:38,356
Sure. Sure.

1001
01:20:38,648 --> 01:20:41,526
I get a modest settlement. Say...

1002
01:20:41,568 --> 01:20:43,403
Oh, say 50,000.

1003
01:20:43,570 --> 01:20:47,198
That should be enough for me
to spend my waning years in Mazatl""n.

1004
01:20:47,615 --> 01:20:50,702
Not Acapulco because I'd keep
thinking about you, Kathie.

1005
01:20:50,785 --> 01:20:53,747
Up there in the women's prison
in Tehachapi.

1006
01:20:53,788 --> 01:20:57,042
It won't be too bad.
Hills all around you, plenty of sun.

1007
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:00,503
You make me nervous.

1008
01:21:00,587 --> 01:21:04,966
You'll be happier if you let the cops
have her. That's what you'll have to do.

1009
01:21:05,018 --> 01:21:09,054
Somebody's gotta take the rap
for Fisher's murder. It's not gonna be me.

1010
01:21:09,106 --> 01:21:10,972
Wait a minute.

1011
01:21:11,097 --> 01:21:14,434
- I'm not framing any woman.
- When did you reform?

1012
01:21:14,684 --> 01:21:17,437
I wouldn't try it, Whit.
You're out of shape.

1013
01:21:17,729 --> 01:21:21,274
- Besides, it's not a frame. She shot him.
- He was gonna kill you.

1014
01:21:21,316 --> 01:21:25,362
See, Whit? Self-defense. A cinch to beat.
She might not even have to do time.

1015
01:21:25,414 --> 01:21:28,150
I'll say you killed
him. They'll believe me.

1016
01:21:28,151 --> 01:21:29,366
Do you believe her?

1017
01:21:31,493 --> 01:21:33,536
Go on, Kathie, tell him about Joe.

1018
01:21:33,828 --> 01:21:35,872
What about Joe? Where is he?

1019
01:21:35,955 --> 01:21:38,792
Last time I saw him,
he was in the East Walker River.

1020
01:21:38,875 --> 01:21:42,462
I didn't send him after Jeff.
It was his own idea.

1021
01:21:44,881 --> 01:21:47,801
- Did you kill him?
- He slipped and fell.

1022
01:21:47,842 --> 01:21:51,596
When I got there, it was too late.
That's a mean river.

1023
01:21:51,638 --> 01:21:52,931
He was trailing you?

1024
01:21:53,014 --> 01:21:55,558
Well, you don't go fishing
with a.45 in your hand.

1025
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,311
But stop worrying about it.
It makes everything simple.

1026
01:21:58,395 --> 01:22:02,273
A dead man? Fish him out.
Stick a note in his pocket. Suicide.

1027
01:22:02,325 --> 01:22:05,433
He couldn't stand living
with what he had done.

1028
01:22:05,485 --> 01:22:08,905
Don't look so stricken, Whit.
You'll get over it. I did.

1029
01:22:09,072 --> 01:22:12,534
But you talk it out if you want to.
I'll be waiting in there.

1030
01:22:12,659 --> 01:22:14,494
Oh, one thing, Kathie:

1031
01:22:14,577 --> 01:22:17,831
Did it take much persuasion
to make you say I killed Fisher?

1032
01:22:17,914 --> 01:22:21,605
Come on. Feed my ego.
Tell me he beat you.

1033
01:22:21,657 --> 01:22:25,296
Tell me he had to drag
every word out of you.

1034
01:22:25,755 --> 01:22:29,718
- Well, that's the way it is.
- You said you were going.

1035
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:31,594
Get out.

1036
01:22:48,153 --> 01:22:51,031
You dirty little phony.
Go on, lie some more.

1037
01:22:51,114 --> 01:22:53,742
Tell me how you handled things
for me in San Francisco.

1038
01:22:53,783 --> 01:22:55,910
Tell me it was all Joe's idea.
Go on, Kathie.

1039
01:22:55,994 --> 01:22:58,705
Show me how you're gonna
squirm your way out this time.

1040
01:22:58,747 --> 01:23:01,750
- Listen...
- What a sucker you must think I am.

1041
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:05,337
I took you back when you
came whimpering and crawling.

1042
01:23:05,378 --> 01:23:08,256
I should have kicked your teeth in.

1043
01:23:08,298 --> 01:23:11,509
No, I'm not going to.

1044
01:23:11,593 --> 01:23:15,805
Not now, Kathie.
We'll let the law push you around.

1045
01:23:15,857 --> 01:23:17,640
- You can't.
- You're wrong.

1046
01:23:17,724 --> 01:23:19,851
You're gonna take the rap and play along.

1047
01:23:19,934 --> 01:23:22,812
You're gonna make every exact move
I tell you.

1048
01:23:22,896 --> 01:23:25,315
If you don't, I'll kill you.

1049
01:23:25,398 --> 01:23:28,193
And I'll promise you one thing:
It won't be quick.

1050
01:23:28,234 --> 01:23:30,236
I'll break you first.

1051
01:23:30,362 --> 01:23:34,366
You won't be able to answer a phone or open
a door without thinking, "This is it."

1052
01:23:34,418 --> 01:23:38,078
And when it comes,
it still won't be quick.

1053
01:23:38,203 --> 01:23:40,288
And it won't be pretty.

1054
01:23:41,623 --> 01:23:44,250
You can take your choice.

1055
01:23:44,834 --> 01:23:46,586
Whit.

1056
01:24:05,689 --> 01:24:09,192
I have to go to Reno for your money.
Where's the file?

1057
01:24:09,234 --> 01:24:11,653
Lt'll be mailed to you.

1058
01:24:11,987 --> 01:24:15,115
I crossed you once. I know better
than to try it a second time.

1059
01:24:16,116 --> 01:24:18,827
I've got a reason for wanting
to be let alone.

1060
01:24:18,868 --> 01:24:21,538
You'll get the file,
after I'm out of reach.

1061
01:24:22,872 --> 01:24:25,750
Well, if that's the way it has to be.

1062
01:24:25,834 --> 01:24:29,045
While you're in Reno, find a pilot
who can keep his mouth shut.

1063
01:24:29,087 --> 01:24:32,590
Tell him to set his plane down
in the desert where he won't be seen.

1064
01:24:32,642 --> 01:24:34,551
Make it about dawn.

1065
01:24:34,634 --> 01:24:37,512
And cheer up, Kathie.
You'll get out of it all right.

1066
01:24:37,554 --> 01:24:39,889
You always have.

1067
01:25:28,813 --> 01:25:31,274
- They say you killed a man.
- Do you believe them?

1068
01:25:31,358 --> 01:25:35,403
- Not until you tell me.
- You believe everything I say, don't you?

1069
01:25:35,455 --> 01:25:38,406
Everything you say to me, I believe.

1070
01:25:38,448 --> 01:25:41,076
I don't know why I do this.

1071
01:25:41,493 --> 01:25:44,621
I don't know why I let you come back
into my life. Why I don't...

1072
01:25:44,704 --> 01:25:48,041
...slap your face and send you home.
I don't know.

1073
01:25:48,083 --> 01:25:51,294
- Because you said you'd come back.
- But not like this.

1074
01:25:51,336 --> 01:25:54,464
- You didn't kill him, did you?
- No.

1075
01:25:55,173 --> 01:25:57,634
You know, I had to come back.

1076
01:26:01,888 --> 01:26:05,767
- Take me with you, Jeff.
- I have to play this alone.

1077
01:26:06,601 --> 01:26:10,480
- You've seen her again?
- Yeah, I saw her.

1078
01:26:10,522 --> 01:26:14,067
- Was it the same?
- I saw her, and it was nothing.

1079
01:26:15,151 --> 01:26:18,029
She can't be all bad. No one is.

1080
01:26:18,071 --> 01:26:20,699
Well, she comes the closest.

1081
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:23,660
- Are you going to see her again?
- Tonight, for the last time.

1082
01:26:23,702 --> 01:26:26,746
Then look at her. And look at yourself.

1083
01:26:26,788 --> 01:26:32,043
And be very sure that there isn't even
a little bit of love left for her.

1084
01:26:32,836 --> 01:26:37,590
Then when you find out
and you know it once and forever...

1085
01:26:37,642 --> 01:26:39,467
...send for me.

1086
01:26:39,551 --> 01:26:43,263
I don't have to find out.
I know it now.

1087
01:26:45,181 --> 01:26:48,768
- That's all I wanted to hear.
- You know, maybe I was wrong...

1088
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:52,355
...and luck is like love.
You have to go all the way to find it.

1089
01:26:52,522 --> 01:26:54,524
You do to keep it.

1090
01:26:54,607 --> 01:26:57,527
You better go.
Did the kid do what I told him?

1091
01:26:57,610 --> 01:27:00,530
They're following him south,
the state police and all of them.

1092
01:27:00,613 --> 01:27:01,948
Good.

1093
01:27:03,074 --> 01:27:05,452
I can't go.

1094
01:27:25,138 --> 01:27:28,350
- You can put that away.
- I can't think of a better place to put it.

1095
01:27:29,976 --> 01:27:33,396
- I just want to tell you something.
- Tell it.

1096
01:27:33,438 --> 01:27:35,023
I was going to kill you.

1097
01:27:35,315 --> 01:27:37,942
- Who isn't?
- Or tell the cops where you were.

1098
01:27:40,445 --> 01:27:41,905
I followed Ann tonight.

1099
01:27:42,864 --> 01:27:46,826
- What stopped you?
- Some things you said to her.

1100
01:27:46,868 --> 01:27:50,622
- You said were gonna tell me something.
- I grew up with her.

1101
01:27:50,664 --> 01:27:53,375
I've loved her ever since
I fixed her roller skates.

1102
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:56,711
I don't know whether I'm good enough
for her, but I know you aren't.

1103
01:27:56,753 --> 01:27:59,964
That's one difference.
The other is that she loves me.

1104
01:28:00,006 --> 01:28:03,488
You told her you didn't know why
you let her back into your dirty life.

1105
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:06,971
I don't know what got you where you are
or where it's gonna take you.

1106
01:28:07,013 --> 01:28:09,349
She's not going with it.

1107
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:12,602
Why don't you say it to the law.

1108
01:28:12,686 --> 01:28:16,147
Then all the rest of your life
you can tell her how you did it.

1109
01:29:02,777 --> 01:29:06,114
You can't make deals
with a dead man, Jeff.

1110
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:08,783
No, you can't.

1111
01:29:15,206 --> 01:29:18,126
- Let's get out of here.
- There's someplace left to go?

1112
01:29:18,168 --> 01:29:21,671
- I think so.
- You're running the show now?

1113
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:27,385
Do you mind, Jeff?

1114
01:29:29,721 --> 01:29:34,121
Remember the mountains? Higher than these
and always snow on them.

1115
01:29:34,173 --> 01:29:38,521
- We should have stayed there.
- I'm trying to remember something else.

1116
01:29:38,563 --> 01:29:41,066
I never told you I was anything
but what I am.

1117
01:29:41,107 --> 01:29:43,276
You just wanted to imagine I was.

1118
01:29:43,401 --> 01:29:46,853
That's why I left you.
Now we're back to stay.

1119
01:29:46,905 --> 01:29:50,742
- And I have nothing to say about it?
- Well, have you?

1120
01:29:50,784 --> 01:29:54,579
Whit's dead.
A bundle of papers isn't any good.

1121
01:29:54,621 --> 01:29:58,041
If Joe was around, you could
use him, but Joe's dead too.

1122
01:29:58,083 --> 01:30:00,460
So, what are you gonna do
about Eels and Fisher?

1123
01:30:00,502 --> 01:30:02,962
For that matter,
what are you gonna do about this?

1124
01:30:03,088 --> 01:30:05,215
Someone has to take the blame.

1125
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:09,761
You have nothing on me, but I'd make
a fine witness for the prosecution.

1126
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:14,641
Don't you see? You've only me
to make deals with now.

1127
01:30:15,308 --> 01:30:18,144
- Well, build my gallows high, baby.
- No.

1128
01:30:18,812 --> 01:30:22,357
No, we're starting all over.
I wanna go back to Mexico.

1129
01:30:22,409 --> 01:30:25,902
I wanna walk out of the sun again
and find you waiting.

1130
01:30:25,944 --> 01:30:30,156
I wanna sit in the same moonlight and
tell you all the things I never told you...

1131
01:30:30,208 --> 01:30:33,994
...until you don't hate me.
Until sometime you love again.

1132
01:30:34,035 --> 01:30:37,122
They'll always be looking for us.
They won't stop till we die.

1133
01:30:37,163 --> 01:30:40,667
I don't care.
Just so they find us together.

1134
01:30:41,584 --> 01:30:45,880
If you're thinking of anyone else, don't.
It wouldn't work.

1135
01:30:45,922 --> 01:30:48,341
You're no good for anyone but me.

1136
01:30:48,425 --> 01:30:50,468
You're no good and neither am I.

1137
01:30:50,927 --> 01:30:53,680
That's why we deserve each other.

1138
01:30:59,352 --> 01:31:01,312
Did he get the plane?

1139
01:31:01,438 --> 01:31:04,774
- Where is it?
- I'm running the show, don't forget.

1140
01:31:04,858 --> 01:31:07,068
I doubt you'll ever let me.
Where's the money?

1141
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:11,239
- Upstairs.
- Better pack a couple of bags and get it.

1142
01:31:13,325 --> 01:31:16,995
- Put a few things in for me.
- I have.

1143
01:32:06,836 --> 01:32:08,296
Thanks.

1144
01:32:10,548 --> 01:32:13,134
Do you remember La Mar Azul?

1145
01:32:13,802 --> 01:32:16,930
If I remember, you were a very
clumsy flirt, but I liked that.

1146
01:32:16,971 --> 01:32:19,182
We owe it all to Jos Rodriguez.

1147
01:32:20,433 --> 01:32:24,062
I wonder if he'll ever know
what a bad guide he really was.

1148
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:28,692
Jeff, we've been wrong a lot
and unlucky a long time.

1149
01:32:28,744 --> 01:32:31,361
I think we deserve a break.

1150
01:32:32,988 --> 01:32:35,281
We deserve each other.

1151
01:33:07,147 --> 01:33:09,107
Hurry, Jeff.

1152
01:33:54,736 --> 01:33:56,613
Dirty, double-crossing rat!

1153
01:34:43,827 --> 01:34:45,662
Sorry.

1154
01:34:49,457 --> 01:34:53,044
Too many people. Too much talk.

1155
01:34:53,169 --> 01:34:55,422
Maybe that's why I like this town.

1156
01:34:55,505 --> 01:34:58,717
Here, three people are really a crowd.

1157
01:35:00,385 --> 01:35:03,430
Let's get in the car
and get away from them.

1158
01:35:03,471 --> 01:35:06,433
I won't talk to you, Ann.
I just wanna be with you.

1159
01:35:06,516 --> 01:35:09,811
Thanks, Jim, but I can't.

1160
01:35:19,821 --> 01:35:23,783
You can tell me.
You knew him better than I did.

1161
01:35:24,075 --> 01:35:26,786
Was he going away with her?

1162
01:35:28,038 --> 01:35:30,290
I have to know.

1163
01:35:32,125 --> 01:35:33,960
Was he going away with her?
