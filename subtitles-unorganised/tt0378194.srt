1
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,504
(man) Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:00:18,237 --> 00:00:20,473
You know, Kiddo...

3
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,907
...I'd like to believe...

4
00:00:22,972 --> 00:00:26,268
...you're aware enough, even now...

5
00:00:26,332 --> 00:00:30,325
...to know that there's nothing sadistic...

6
00:00:30,428 --> 00:00:32,467
...in my actions.

7
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:36,815
At this moment...

8
00:00:36,924 --> 00:00:39,444
...this is me...

9
00:00:39,515 --> 00:00:42,035
...at my most masochistic.

10
00:00:42,107 --> 00:00:44,528
Bill.

11
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:45,847
It's your ba...

12
00:00:50,747 --> 00:00:52,535
(woman) Looked dead, didn't I?

13
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:54,195
Well, I wasn't.

14
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:57,681
But it wasn't from lack of trying,
I can tell you that.

15
00:00:57,754 --> 00:01:00,753
Actually, Bill's last bullet
put me in a coma -

16
00:01:00,826 --> 00:01:04,023
a coma I was to lie in for four years.

17
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:09,017
When I woke up, I went on what
the movie advertisements refer to as

18
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:12,397
"a roaring rampage of revenge."

19
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:15,407
I roared, and I rampaged,

20
00:01:15,482 --> 00:01:18,896
and I got bloody satisfaction.

21
00:01:18,968 --> 00:01:22,645
I've killed a hell of a lot of people
to get to this point,

22
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:25,843
but I've only one more.

23
00:01:25,912 --> 00:01:27,887
The last one.

24
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:31,343
The one I'm driving to right now.

25
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:34,133
The only one left.

26
00:01:34,232 --> 00:01:37,712
And when I arrive at my destination,

27
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:40,881
I am gonna kill Bill.

28
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:42,838
(# instrumental)

29
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,426
(woman) The incident that happened
at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel

30
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:11,501
that put this whole gory story into motion

31
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:14,126
has since become legend.

32
00:02:14,197 --> 00:02:16,783
"Massacre at Two Pines."

33
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:18,763
That's what the newspapers called it.

34
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,594
The local TVnews called it,

35
00:02:20,661 --> 00:02:24,490
"The El Paso, Texas
Wedding Chapel Massacre."

36
00:02:24,565 --> 00:02:27,150
How it happened, who was there,

37
00:02:27,221 --> 00:02:30,036
how many got killed
and who killed them -

38
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:33,516
changes depending on
who's telling the story.

39
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:38,804
In actual fact, the massacre didn't
happen during a wedding at all.

40
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,201
It was a wedding rehearsal.

41
00:02:41,268 --> 00:02:43,690
Now, when we come
to the part where I say,

42
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:47,855
"You may kiss the bride,"
you may kiss the bride.

43
00:02:47,924 --> 00:02:50,160
But don't stick your tongue in her mouth.

44
00:02:50,227 --> 00:02:52,136
(laughter)

45
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:54,218
This might be funny to your friends,

46
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:57,324
but it would be embarrassing
to your parents.

47
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:58,921
(laughter continues)

48
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:01,897
We'll try to restrain ourselves, Reverend.

49
00:03:03,122 --> 00:03:04,945
Y'all got a song?

50
00:03:08,306 --> 00:03:11,502
How 'bout "Love Me Tender"?
I can play that.

51
00:03:11,602 --> 00:03:13,489
- Sure.
- Yeah.

52
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:15,822
"Love Me Tender" would be great.

53
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:18,856
Rufus - he's the man.

54
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:21,864
Rufus, who was that
that you used to play for?

55
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:23,847
Rufus Thomas.

56
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:26,703
Rufus Thomas.
Rufus Thomas.

57
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:30,925
I was a Drell. I was a Drifter.
I was a Coaster.

58
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:34,440
I was part of the Gang.
I was a Barkay.

59
00:03:34,513 --> 00:03:38,539
If they come through Texas,
I done played with 'em.

60
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:41,925
Rufus - he's the man.

61
00:03:44,912 --> 00:03:46,984
- Have I forgotten anything?
- Um...

62
00:03:47,088 --> 00:03:50,404
Oh yes, you forgot, uh,
the seating arrangements.

63
00:03:50,512 --> 00:03:52,999
- Thank you, Mother.
- Yes.

64
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:55,210
Now, the way we normally do this -

65
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,208
we have the bride's side,
and then we have the groom's side.

66
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:02,377
But since the bride
ain't got nobody comin',

67
00:04:02,447 --> 00:04:06,222
and the groom's got
far too many people comin'...

68
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,418
Well, yeah, they're comin'
all the way from Oklahoma.

69
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,237
Right...

70
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:15,172
Well, I don't see no problem with...

71
00:04:15,278 --> 00:04:18,409
...the groom's side
sharing the bride's side.

72
00:04:18,477 --> 00:04:21,379
- Do you, Mother?
- I don't have a problem with that.

73
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:23,144
But, uh...

74
00:04:23,214 --> 00:04:27,272
Honey, you know, it would be good
if you had somebody come.

75
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:29,414
You know, as a sign of good faith?

76
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:33,252
Well, I don't have anybody...

77
00:04:33,325 --> 00:04:37,100
...except for Tommy and my friends.

78
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:41,420
- You have no family?
- Well, I'm workin' on changing that.

79
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:45,575
Mrs. Harmony, we're all the family
this little angel's ever gonna need.

80
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,049
I'm not feeling very well,
and this bitch is starting to piss me off.

81
00:04:51,148 --> 00:04:54,409
So while y'all blather on,
I'm gonna go outside and get some air.

82
00:04:54,476 --> 00:04:57,475
OK. Um, uh, Reverend, sorry, uh...

83
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:01,027
- She's gonna go out and get some air.
- Yeah. Given her delicate condition...

84
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:03,652
She just needs a few minutes
to get it together. She'll be OK.

85
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:06,057
(Reverend) Right...

(# flute)

87
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:21,283
Hello, Kiddo.

88
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,747
- How did you find me?
- I'm the man.

89
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:37,316
What are you doin' here?

90
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:39,803
What am I doin'?

91
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:43,100
Well...

92
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:46,304
...moment ago I was playin' my flute.

93
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:54,972
At this moment...

94
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:59,353
...l'm lookin' at the most beautiful bride
these old eyes have ever seen.

95
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:04,602
- Why are you here?
- Last look.

96
00:07:07,204 --> 00:07:10,749
- Are you gonna be nice?
- I've never been nice in my whole life.

97
00:07:12,643 --> 00:07:15,839
But I'll do my best to be sweet.

98
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,014
Hmm.

99
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:20,417
I always told you...

100
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:23,679
...your sweet side is you best side.

101
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:28,056
I guess that's why you're
the only one who's ever seen it.

102
00:07:30,402 --> 00:07:33,599
- So you got a bun in the oven.
- Hmm.

103
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,906
- I'm knocked up.
- Jeez, Louise.

104
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:45,243
That young man of yours sure doesn't
believe in wasting time, does he?

105
00:07:45,313 --> 00:07:47,768
Have you seen Tommy?

106
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:52,888
- Big guy in the tux?
- Yes.

107
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,000
Then I saw him.

108
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,135
I like his hair.

109
00:07:59,457 --> 00:08:01,725
You promised you'd be nice.

110
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:07,359
No, I said I'd do my best.
That's hardly a promise.

111
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:10,331
But you're right.

112
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,367
What does your young man
do for a living?

113
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,918
He owns a used record store
here in El Paso.

114
00:08:17,983 --> 00:08:22,489
- Ah. Music lover, eh?
- He's fond of music.

115
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,688
Aren't we all?

116
00:08:29,182 --> 00:08:32,826
And what are you doing
for a J-O-B these days?

117
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:37,268
I work in the record store.

118
00:08:37,374 --> 00:08:40,603
Aso.

119
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:43,636
It all suddenly seems so clear.

120
00:08:45,982 --> 00:08:50,204
- Do you like it?
- Yeah. I like it a lot, smartass.

121
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:53,845
I get to listen to music all day...

122
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:57,746
...talk about music all day.
It's really cool.

123
00:08:58,557 --> 00:09:02,069
It's gonna be a great environment
for my little girl to grow up in.

124
00:09:04,828 --> 00:09:09,335
As opposed to jetting around the world,
killing human beings,

125
00:09:09,404 --> 00:09:14,008
and being paid vast sums of money?

126
00:09:14,076 --> 00:09:15,352
Precisely.

127
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:18,289
Well, my old friend...

128
00:09:18,363 --> 00:09:20,632
...to each his own.

129
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,074
However, all cockblockery aside...

130
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,463
I am looking forward
to meeting your young man.

131
00:09:28,538 --> 00:09:33,589
I happen to be, more or less,
particular whom my gal marries.

132
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,633
- You want to come to the wedding?
- Only if I can sit on the bride's side.

133
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:43,672
You'll find it a bit lonely on my side.

134
00:09:43,738 --> 00:09:47,054
Your side always was a bit lonely.

135
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,039
But I wouldn't sit anywhere else.

136
00:09:52,313 --> 00:09:54,255
You know...

137
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:56,696
...I had the loveliest dream about you...

138
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:59,095
Oh, here's Tommy!
Call me Arlene.

139
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:01,358
- You must be Tommy!
- Uh-huh.

140
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:03,766
Arlene's told me so much about you.

141
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:06,516
- Honey, you OK?
- Oh, I'm fine.

142
00:10:06,617 --> 00:10:09,551
Tommy, I'd like you to meet my father.

143
00:10:09,657 --> 00:10:12,275
Oh, my God!

144
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:14,034
Oh, my God, this is great!

145
00:10:14,104 --> 00:10:16,788
I'm so glad to meet you, sir... uh, Dad.

146
00:10:16,856 --> 00:10:19,059
The name's Bill.

147
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:21,364
Well, it's great to meet you... Bill.

148
00:10:21,432 --> 00:10:24,498
- Arlene told me you couldn't make it.
- Surprise.

149
00:10:24,568 --> 00:10:27,699
That's my pop for ya.
Always full of surprises.

150
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:31,028
Well, in the surprise department...

151
00:10:31,095 --> 00:10:34,323
...the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

152
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:36,463
- When did you get in?
- Just now.

153
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,535
- Did you come straight from Australia?
- Of course.

154
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:43,282
Daddy, I told Tommy that you were
in Perth mining for silver, and...

155
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,292
...no one could reach you.

156
00:10:45,398 --> 00:10:48,529
Lucky for us all, that's not the case.

157
00:10:48,598 --> 00:10:50,605
So...

158
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:54,289
What's this all about?
I've heard of wedding rehearsals,

159
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:58,416
but I don't believe I've ever heard of
a wedding dress rehearsal before.

160
00:10:58,485 --> 00:10:59,761
We thought,

161
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,895
"Why pay so much money for a dress
you're only gonna wear once?"

162
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:05,835
Especially when Arlene looks
so goddamn beautiful in it.

163
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:09,486
So, I think we're gonna try to get
all the mileage we can out of it.

164
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:13,999
Isn't it supposed to be bad luck
for the groom to see the bride

165
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,969
in her wedding dress
before the ceremony?

166
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:21,196
Well, I guess I just believe
in living dangerously.

167
00:11:22,964 --> 00:11:25,004
I know just what you mean.

168
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:28,142
(Reverend) Son.
Some of us have places to be.

169
00:11:28,212 --> 00:11:29,804
(Rufus) Sure do.

170
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:34,065
Look, we got to go through this one
more time. So, why don't you have a s...

171
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:37,961
Oh, my God. What am I thinking?
You should give her away!

172
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:41,612
Tommy, that's not exactly
Daddy's cup of tea.

173
00:11:41,682 --> 00:11:44,071
I think Father would be
much more comfortable

174
00:11:44,146 --> 00:11:46,993
- sitting with the rest of the guests.
- Hmm. Really?

175
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,977
That's asking a lot.

176
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:53,099
Oh. OK.
Well, forget it.

177
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,821
But how about we go out
to dinner tonight to celebrate?

178
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,508
Only on the condition that
I pay for everything.

179
00:11:58,578 --> 00:12:01,065
Deal. We got to do this now.

180
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,966
- Can I watch?
- Absolutely. Have a seat.

181
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,888
- Which is the bride's side?
- Right over here.

182
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:13,350
(Reverend) Mother, here we go!

183
00:12:14,993 --> 00:12:17,894
Now son, about them vows...

184
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:21,772
(# guitar)

185
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,315
Bill...

186
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:30,693
- I just want...
- You don't owe me a damn thing.

187
00:12:30,768 --> 00:12:33,223
If he's the man you want...

188
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:36,230
...then go stand by him.

189
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:02,476
- Do I look pretty?
- Oh, yes.

190
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:15,081
Thank you.

191
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:49,633
(Reverend) What the hell?

192
00:13:49,706 --> 00:13:50,983
(screaming)

193
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,970
(bride) No! Bill!

194
00:13:53,034 --> 00:13:55,205
(machine gunfire)

195
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:00,962
(barking)

196
00:14:01,034 --> 00:14:03,368
(bells toll)

197
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:22,142
(bird chirps)

198
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,296
You tellin' me she cut her way through
88 bodyguards before she got to O-Ren?

199
00:14:36,488 --> 00:14:38,462
Nah, there wasn't really 88 of 'em.

200
00:14:38,536 --> 00:14:41,187
They just called themselves
"The Crazy 88"

201
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,328
- How come?
- I don't know.

202
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:46,432
I guess they thought it sounded cool.

203
00:14:46,503 --> 00:14:49,983
Anyhow, they all fell
under her Hanzo sword.

204
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,884
- She got a Hanzo sword?
- He made one for her.

205
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:57,286
Didn't he swear a blood oath
to never make another sword?

206
00:14:57,735 --> 00:15:00,801
It would appear he has broken it.

207
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:06,461
Them Japs sure know how
to hold a grudge, don't they?

208
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:10,428
Or maybe...

209
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:13,759
...you just tend
to bring that out in people.

210
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:18,336
I know this is a ridiculous question
before I ask it,

211
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:22,813
but you haven't, by any chance,
kept up with your... swordplay?

212
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:27,163
I, um...

213
00:15:27,268 --> 00:15:30,617
(belches) I pawned that years ago.

214
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:33,921
You hocked a Hattori Hanzo sword?

215
00:15:34,788 --> 00:15:35,966
Yep.

216
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:37,946
It was priceless.

217
00:15:42,404 --> 00:15:46,594
Well, not in El Paso, it ain't.

218
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:49,528
In El Paso, I got me $250 for it.

219
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:54,651
I'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill.

220
00:15:54,723 --> 00:15:56,862
(sniffs)

221
00:15:56,931 --> 00:15:59,713
If she wants to fight with me, all she's
got to do is come down to the club

222
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:02,429
and start some shit,
and we'll be in a fight.

223
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:08,734
I know we haven't spoken in some time,

224
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:12,446
and the last time we spoke
wasn't the most pleasant,

225
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:16,769
but you've got to get over
being mad at me,

226
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,873
and start becoming afraid of (bleep),

227
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:22,523
because she is coming,
and she's coming to kill you.

228
00:16:23,713 --> 00:16:27,674
And unless you accept my assistance,
I have no doubt she will succeed.

229
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,048
I don't dodge guilt, and I don't Jew
out of paying my comeuppance.

230
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,429
Can't we just... forget the past?

231
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,126
That woman...

232
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,265
...deserves her revenge.

233
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,958
And...

234
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:02,714
...we deserve to die.

235
00:17:06,846 --> 00:17:09,334
But then again...

236
00:17:09,438 --> 00:17:11,413
...so does she.

237
00:17:14,718 --> 00:17:17,205
So I guess...

238
00:17:17,278 --> 00:17:19,580
...we'll just see.

239
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,576
Won't we?

Budd, can't you tell time?

244
00:18:02,523 --> 00:18:04,246
There ain't nobody in here, man.

245
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:06,552
- (man) Is that Budd?
- Yeah.

246
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:09,499

his fucking ass back here!

247
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:11,383
OK.

00:18:11,451 --> 00:18:15,542
Budd, Larry'd like a word with ya.

00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,679

Be somebody, baby.

250
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:32,944
You looking for me?

251
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:42,097
I don't know what car wash
you worked before you came here

252
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:45,364
that let you stroll in 20 minutes late,
but it wasn't owned by me

253
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:47,985
- and I own a fuckin' car wash.
- Do you want me to leave?

254
00:18:48,056 --> 00:18:51,090
No, I don't want you to leave.
I want you to sit and wait.

255
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:53,265
Larry...

256
00:18:53,336 --> 00:18:56,151
...there ain't nobody out there, so...

257
00:18:56,216 --> 00:19:01,453
(slurring) "There's nobody
out there, Larry."

258
00:19:01,527 --> 00:19:03,698
What's your point?

259
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:08,175
- That you're not needed here?
- My point is...

260
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:12,687
...l'm the bouncer, and there
ain't nobody out there to bounce.

261
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,889
You saying that the reason...

262
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:19,636
...that you're not doing the job that I'm...

263
00:19:19,703 --> 00:19:24,012
...paying you to do is that
you don't have a job to do?

264
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,433
- No...
- Is that what you're saying?

265
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,356
What are you trying
to convince me of, exactly?

266
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:34,218
That you're as useless
as an asshole right here?

267
00:19:34,294 --> 00:19:36,530
Well, guess what, buddy?

268
00:19:36,597 --> 00:19:41,583
I think... you just fucking convinced me.

269
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:43,725
Let's go to the calendar.

270
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:45,967
It's calendar time.

271
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:48,458
Calendar time for Buddy.

272
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:51,793
- OK. You working tomorrow?
- Yeah.

273
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,788
Mm. No, you're n... You don't even know
what fucking day you work.

You're working Wednesday.
Here you are. There you go.

- Workin' Thursday?
- Yeah.

277
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:07,183
I don't think so.

I d... There's your name.

279
00:20:09,235 --> 00:20:12,082
- If you say so.
- There used to be your name. OK?

280
00:20:12,148 --> 00:20:14,864
- Saturday. There used to be your name.
- Oh.

281
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,872
Uh, Monday...

282
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:18,386
Here. How about that?

283
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:23,054
Fuckin' with your cash is the only thing
you kids seem to understand. OK?

284
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:26,603

Before you leave, talk to Rocket.
She's got a job for you to do.

And...

288
00:20:37,106 --> 00:20:39,724
...the hat.

289
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:41,615
That fuckin' hat.

291
00:20:45,425 --> 00:20:48,272
How many times have I told you,

292
00:20:48,337 --> 00:20:52,133
don't wear that fucking hat here?
How many?

293
00:20:56,528 --> 00:20:57,935
Customers wear hats.

294
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,553
Well, I'm not the boss of the customers.

295
00:21:00,624 --> 00:21:04,421
I'm the boss of you.
And I'm telling you...

296
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:09,165
...that I want you to keep
that shit-kicker hat at home.

Yeah. Budd, honey, uh,
the toilet is at it again.

There's shitty water all over the floor.

301
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,978
OK... Rocket.

302
00:21:53,805 --> 00:21:56,489
- I'll clean it up.

00:40:10,954 --> 00:40:16,518
...the Massacre of the Shaolin Temple,
and all sixty of the monks inside,

486
00:40:16,585 --> 00:40:19,901
at the fists of the White Lotus.

487
00:40:19,977 --> 00:40:23,621
And... so began the legend...

488
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:27,911
...of Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

489
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:30,115
And what, pray tell,
is the Five-Point-Palm

490
00:40:30,217 --> 00:40:32,704
- Exploding-Heart Technique?
- Quite simply,

491
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,670
the deadliest blow in all of martial arts.

492
00:40:39,048 --> 00:40:42,463
He hits you with his fingertips...

493
00:40:42,536 --> 00:40:46,310
...at five different pressure
points on your body...

494
00:40:46,376 --> 00:40:50,237
...and then lets you walk away.

495
00:40:50,311 --> 00:40:53,158
But once you've taken five steps...

496
00:40:53,223 --> 00:40:57,084
...your heart explodes inside your body...

497
00:40:57,158 --> 00:41:00,125
...and you fall to the floor, dead.

498
00:41:01,222 --> 00:41:03,164
- Did he teach you that?
- No.

499
00:41:05,158 --> 00:41:09,249
He teaches no one the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

500
00:41:10,022 --> 00:41:12,258
Now...

501
00:41:12,326 --> 00:41:15,457
...one of the things
I've always liked about you...

502
00:41:15,526 --> 00:41:17,435
...Kiddo...

503
00:41:18,662 --> 00:41:21,695
...is you appear
wise beyond your years.

504
00:41:25,221 --> 00:41:29,661
So, allow me to impart
a word to the wise:

505
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:31,293
Whatever...

506
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:35,161
...whatever Pai Mei says, obey.

507
00:41:36,549 --> 00:41:41,469
If you flash him, even for an instant,
a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.

508
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:46,555
And if you throw any
American sass his way...

509
00:41:46,627 --> 00:41:49,693
...he'll snap your back and your neck
like they were twigs.

510
00:41:52,995 --> 00:41:55,678
And that will be the story of you.

511
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:01,209
(# flute)

512
00:42:15,105 --> 00:42:17,560
He'll accept you as his student.

513
00:42:17,633 --> 00:42:19,640
- What happened to you?
- Nothin'.

514
00:42:19,713 --> 00:42:22,747
- Get in a fight?
- Friendly contest.

515
00:42:22,817 --> 00:42:24,192
Why did he accept me?

516
00:42:24,257 --> 00:42:28,348
Because he's a very, very, very old man.

517
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:31,515
And like all rotten bastards...

518
00:42:31,584 --> 00:42:36,538
...when they become old,
they get lonely.

519
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:39,478
Which has no effect
on their dispositions,

520
00:42:39,553 --> 00:42:44,092
but it does teach them
the value of company.

521
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,526
Whew. Oh.

522
00:42:46,624 --> 00:42:51,326
(sighs) Just seein' those
steps again makes me ache.

523
00:42:51,935 --> 00:42:53,211
You're gonna have a lot of fun

524
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,989
carrying buckets of water
up and down that fucker.

525
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:03,286
When will I see you again?

526
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:06,707
That's the title of my favorite
soul song of the seventies.

527
00:43:06,783 --> 00:43:08,506
- What?
- Nothin'.

528
00:43:08,574 --> 00:43:10,909
When he tells me you're done.

529
00:43:11,935 --> 00:43:13,527
When do you think that might be?

530
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:16,445
That, my dearest,
depends entirely on you.

531
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,990
Now remember,
no sarcasm, no backtalk.

532
00:43:20,062 --> 00:43:22,266
At least not for the first year or so.

533
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:25,400
You're gonna have to let him
warm up to you.

534
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:29,146
He hates Caucasians,
despises Americans,

535
00:43:29,214 --> 00:43:31,897
and has nothing
but contempt for women.

536
00:43:34,172 --> 00:43:37,434
So in your case...
it might take a little while.

537
00:43:38,397 --> 00:43:40,982
- Adis.
- (engine starts)

538
00:45:16,215 --> 00:45:17,262
Master...

539
00:45:19,062 --> 00:45:20,655
Your Mandarin is lousy.

540
00:45:21,623 --> 00:45:22,932
It causes my ears discomfort.

541
00:45:22,999 --> 00:45:24,493
You bray like an ass!

542
00:45:25,302 --> 00:45:27,342
You are not to speak unless spoken to.

543
00:45:28,214 --> 00:45:31,661
Is it too much to hope...
you understand Cantonese?

544
00:45:35,254 --> 00:45:36,595
I speak Japanese very well...

545
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:39,825
I didn't ask if you speak Japanese...

546
00:45:39,893 --> 00:45:41,965
I asked if you understand Cantonese?

547
00:45:43,445 --> 00:45:44,394
A little.

548
00:45:45,045 --> 00:45:49,452
You are here to learn the mysteries
of Kung Fu, not linguistics.

549
00:45:49,844 --> 00:45:51,852
If you can't understand me...

550
00:45:51,956 --> 00:45:53,363
I will communicate with you
like I would a dog.

551
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:57,000
When I yell, when I point,
when I beat you with my stick!

552
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:04,593
Bill is your master, is he not?

553
00:46:06,419 --> 00:46:07,848
Yes, he is.

554
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:13,743
Your master tells me...
you're not entirely unschooled.

555
00:46:14,643 --> 00:46:15,952
What training do you possess?

556
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:19,306
I am proficient in Tiger-Crane Style,

557
00:46:19,379 --> 00:46:23,208
and I am more than proficient in the
exquisite art of the Samurai sword.

558
00:46:23,315 --> 00:46:24,460
(scoffs)

559
00:46:24,562 --> 00:46:26,929
The exquisite art of the Samurai sword.
Don't make me laugh!

560
00:46:27,474 --> 00:46:31,881
Your so-called exquisite art,
is only fit for...

561
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:33,737
Japanese fat heads!

562
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:36,199
(laughs)

563
00:46:38,674 --> 00:46:43,594
Your anger amuses me.
Do you believe you are my match?

564
00:46:44,113 --> 00:46:44,680
No.

565
00:46:45,489 --> 00:46:47,377
Are you aware I kill at will?

566
00:46:48,017 --> 00:46:49,032
Yes.

567
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:50,863
Is it your wish to die?

568
00:46:51,249 --> 00:46:51,598
No.

569
00:46:51,793 --> 00:46:53,615
(laughs)

570
00:46:53,713 --> 00:46:54,641
Then you must be stupid...

571
00:46:54,641 --> 00:46:56,942
Then you must be stupid... so stupid.

572
00:46:57,009 --> 00:47:00,521
Rise, and let me look at your
ridiculous face.

573
00:47:01,009 --> 00:47:02,121
Rise.

574
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,847
So my pathetic friend...
Is there anything that you can do well?

575
00:47:12,687 --> 00:47:14,542
What's the matter?

576
00:47:14,959 --> 00:47:16,814
Cat got your tongue?

577
00:47:18,223 --> 00:47:21,070
- Oh yes, you speak Japanese.

578
00:47:21,678 --> 00:47:23,053
I despise the Goddamn Japs!

579
00:47:25,999 --> 00:47:27,624
Go to that rack.

580
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:36,557
Remove the sword.

581
00:47:42,766 --> 00:47:45,253
(whooshes)

582
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,560
Let's see how good you really are.

583
00:48:04,396 --> 00:48:05,957
lf...

584
00:48:06,604 --> 00:48:08,229
...you land a single blow,

585
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,558
I'll bow down and call you master.

586
00:48:12,268 --> 00:48:14,406
(whipping)

587
00:48:16,203 --> 00:48:18,058
(grunts)

588
00:48:18,123 --> 00:48:19,585
(grunts)

589
00:48:22,635 --> 00:48:23,748
(grunting)

590
00:48:25,227 --> 00:48:27,529
From here you can get
an excellent view of my foot.

591
00:48:27,659 --> 00:48:28,641
(thud)

592
00:48:30,027 --> 00:48:31,936
(laughs)

593
00:48:32,587 --> 00:48:35,783
Your swordsmanship...
is amateur at best.

594
00:48:35,978 --> 00:48:37,320
(whipping)

595
00:48:41,162 --> 00:48:42,950
(grunting)

596
00:48:49,353 --> 00:48:54,471
Your so-called kung-fu... is really...
quite pathetic.

597
00:48:57,129 --> 00:49:00,773
I asked you to demonstrate...
what you know... and you did...

598
00:49:01,449 --> 00:49:02,594
Not a goddamn thing!

599
00:49:03,657 --> 00:49:07,104
Let's see your Tiger Crane...
match my Eagle's Claw.

600
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,106
(whooshes)

601
00:49:21,256 --> 00:49:23,590
(grunting)

602
00:49:30,151 --> 00:49:31,558
(grunts)

603
00:49:38,566 --> 00:49:40,955
(grunting)

604
00:49:41,575 --> 00:49:44,258
(grunts/laughs)

605
00:49:50,694 --> 00:49:52,155
(grunting continues)

606
00:49:52,805 --> 00:49:53,983
(laughs)

607
00:49:56,485 --> 00:49:57,914
(screams)

608
00:50:00,389 --> 00:50:01,850
(screams)

609
00:50:01,925 --> 00:50:03,813
Like all Yankee women...

610
00:50:03,877 --> 00:50:07,226
...all you can do is order in restaurants
and spend a man's money.

611
00:50:08,356 --> 00:50:09,883
Excruciating... isn't it?

612
00:50:09,988 --> 00:50:11,166
Yes!

613
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:13,984
If it was my wish...

614
00:50:14,468 --> 00:50:15,744
...I could chop your arm off.

615
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:17,023
No, please don't!

616
00:50:17,093 --> 00:50:18,369
(laughs)

617
00:50:18,436 --> 00:50:20,640
It's my arm now. I can do what I please.

618
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:23,390
If you can stop me... I suggest you try.

619
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,467
(screams)

620
00:50:25,539 --> 00:50:26,488
I can't.

621
00:50:27,619 --> 00:50:28,797
Because you're helpless?

622
00:50:29,635 --> 00:50:30,496
Yes.

623
00:50:33,027 --> 00:50:35,034
Have you ever felt this before?

624
00:50:35,427 --> 00:50:36,191
No.

625
00:50:36,546 --> 00:50:39,710
Compared to me... you're as helpless
as a worm fighting an eagle?

626
00:50:40,707 --> 00:50:41,819
YES!!!

627
00:50:43,971 --> 00:50:44,669
THAT'S THE BEGINNING!

628
00:50:50,178 --> 00:50:52,666
Is it your wish to possess
this kind of power?

629
00:50:55,266 --> 00:50:56,792
Yes!

630
00:50:58,306 --> 00:51:00,956
Your training will begin... tomorrow.

631
00:51:06,945 --> 00:51:08,734
(yells)

632
00:51:09,377 --> 00:51:10,686
Since your arm now belongs to me...

633
00:51:11,585 --> 00:51:12,795
...I want it strong.

634
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:15,679
Can you do that?

635
00:51:17,313 --> 00:51:18,906
I can, but not that close.

636
00:51:19,073 --> 00:51:20,316
Then you can't do it.

637
00:51:21,504 --> 00:51:25,116
What if your enemy...
is three inches in front of you...

638
00:51:26,144 --> 00:51:27,354
...What do you do then...

639
00:51:28,448 --> 00:51:29,495
...Curl into a ball...

640
00:51:31,104 --> 00:51:32,314
...or do you put your FIST through him?

641
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:34,554
Now begin.

642
00:51:44,606 --> 00:51:45,784
(grunts)

643
00:51:47,455 --> 00:51:49,015
(grunts)

644
00:51:57,054 --> 00:51:58,941
(grunts)

645
00:52:00,573 --> 00:52:02,002
(grunts)

646
00:52:03,038 --> 00:52:04,598
(groans)

647
00:52:05,437 --> 00:52:06,899
It's the wood that should
fear your hand...

648
00:52:06,974 --> 00:52:09,340
- not the other way around.

649
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:14,201
No wonder you can't do it...
you acquiesce to defeat...

650
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:15,643
- before you even begin.

651
00:52:16,253 --> 00:52:17,627
(scoffs)

652
00:52:30,172 --> 00:52:32,027
(grunting)

653
00:52:33,563 --> 00:52:35,221
(continues grunting)

654
00:52:38,171 --> 00:52:40,081
(grunting)

655
00:52:50,523 --> 00:52:53,108
(continues grunting)

656
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:57,715
(gasping)

657
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:09,496
(grunting)

658
00:53:11,994 --> 00:53:14,099
(yelling)

659
00:53:21,689 --> 00:53:24,623
(continues yelling)

660
00:53:26,936 --> 00:53:29,108
(rainfall)

661
00:53:52,471 --> 00:53:53,399
(chopsticks fall)

662
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:01,809
If you want to eat like a dog...

663
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,940
You can live and sleep
outside like a dog.

664
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:09,172
If you want to live and sleep
like a human...

665
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:12,139
...pick up those sticks.

666
00:54:42,836 --> 00:54:44,723
(sighs)

667
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:53,196
(sighs)

668
00:55:03,507 --> 00:55:05,263
(whoosh)

669
00:55:55,887 --> 00:55:57,382
(grunts)

670
00:56:40,845 --> 00:56:42,667
(grunts)

671
00:57:34,441 --> 00:57:37,889
Come on, you bitch.

672
00:57:39,528 --> 00:57:40,772
(grunts)

673
00:58:17,255 --> 00:58:19,775
OK, Pai Mei.

674
00:58:21,894 --> 00:58:24,131
Here I come.

675
00:58:26,694 --> 00:58:30,338
(grunting)

676
00:58:59,908 --> 00:59:01,567
(grunting faster)

677
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:32,765
(gasping)

678
00:59:34,594 --> 00:59:36,568
(wheezing)

679
00:59:45,441 --> 00:59:47,350
(grunts)

680
00:59:48,449 --> 00:59:50,489
(gasping)

681
00:59:56,256 --> 00:59:58,973
(wheezing)

682
01:00:00,672 --> 01:00:03,520
(breathing softly)

683
01:00:18,847 --> 01:00:20,440
(chimes)

684
01:00:27,422 --> 01:00:31,383
May I have a glass of water, please?

685
01:00:52,637 --> 01:00:53,946
(screeching)

686
01:03:02,101 --> 01:03:05,396
- So that's a Texas funeral?
- Yep.

687
01:03:06,933 --> 01:03:09,136
I have to give it to ya, Budd.

688
01:03:09,204 --> 01:03:12,172
That's a pretty fucked up way to die.

689
01:03:12,244 --> 01:03:14,579
What's the name on the grave
she's buried under?

690
01:03:15,412 --> 01:03:17,135
Paula...

691
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:20,522
...Schultz.

692
01:03:25,652 --> 01:03:26,994
Can I look at the sword?

693
01:03:27,091 --> 01:03:30,474
That's my money right there
in that red bag, isn't it?

694
01:03:30,579 --> 01:03:33,165
It sure is.

695
01:03:33,236 --> 01:03:35,537
Well then, it's your sword now.

696
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:52,781
(blender whirring)

697
01:03:54,034 --> 01:03:55,889
What's that you said?

698
01:03:55,954 --> 01:03:58,255
So this is a Hattori Hanzo sword?

699
01:03:58,353 --> 01:04:00,557
That's a Hanzo sword, all right.

700
01:04:00,658 --> 01:04:03,308
Bill tells me you once had
one of these of your own.

701
01:04:04,817 --> 01:04:06,704
Yeah, once.

702
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:09,452
Yeah? How does this one
compare to that?

703
01:04:18,128 --> 01:04:21,511
If you're gonna compare
a Hanzo sword...

704
01:04:23,056 --> 01:04:26,700
...you compare it
to every other sword ever made -

705
01:04:26,768 --> 01:04:31,470
wasn't made - by Hattori Hanzo.

706
01:04:36,336 --> 01:04:38,474
(sniffs/clears throat)

707
01:04:39,023 --> 01:04:41,837
Here you go.
Wrap your lips around that.

708
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:53,475
So...

709
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,939
...which "R" are you filled with?

710
01:04:56,686 --> 01:04:58,595
What?

711
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:03,012
They say...

712
01:05:03,118 --> 01:05:05,190
...the number one killer...

713
01:05:05,293 --> 01:05:07,202
...of old people...

714
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:10,506
...is retirement.

715
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:16,269
People got a job to do, they tend to live
a little bit longer so they can do it.

716
01:05:17,805 --> 01:05:20,041
I've always figured that...

717
01:05:20,108 --> 01:05:23,043
...warriors and their enemies...

718
01:05:23,117 --> 01:05:25,669
...share the same relationship.

719
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:28,969
So now that you're not gonna have
to face your enemy no more

720
01:05:29,036 --> 01:05:31,076
on the battlefield...

721
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:35,009
...which "R" ya filled with?

722
01:05:36,779 --> 01:05:38,667
Relief...

723
01:05:41,195 --> 01:05:42,886
...or regret?

724
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:48,713
- A little bit of both.
- Horseshit.

725
01:05:49,899 --> 01:05:52,649
I'm sure you do feel a little bit of both.

726
01:05:53,354 --> 01:05:56,321
But I know damn well that you feel one...

727
01:05:56,394 --> 01:05:58,915
...more than you feel the other.

728
01:05:58,986 --> 01:06:02,947
And the question was:
Which one is it?

729
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:06,180
Regret.

730
01:06:07,914 --> 01:06:10,248
You know,
you gotta hand it to the ol' girl.

731
01:06:10,314 --> 01:06:14,918
I never saw anybody buffalo Bill
the way she buffaloed Bill.

732
01:06:14,985 --> 01:06:16,992
Bill thought she was so damn smart.

733
01:06:17,065 --> 01:06:19,334
And I tried to tell him...

734
01:06:19,401 --> 01:06:21,506
...she was just smart for a blond.

735
01:06:39,975 --> 01:06:41,633
Thanks a bunch.

736
01:06:48,167 --> 01:06:51,014
(sniffs/clears throat)

737
01:06:51,079 --> 01:06:53,534
(chuckles)

738
01:06:53,607 --> 01:06:55,396
All right.

739
01:06:55,463 --> 01:06:58,048
(hissing)

740
01:06:58,118 --> 01:07:00,638
(screaming)

741
01:07:09,894 --> 01:07:11,803
(continues screaming)

742
01:07:23,909 --> 01:07:26,364
Mmm.

743
01:07:26,437 --> 01:07:28,259
I'm sorry, Budd.

744
01:07:28,324 --> 01:07:30,844
That was rude of me, wasn't it?

745
01:07:30,916 --> 01:07:34,299
Budd, I'd like to introduce my friend,
the black mamba.

746
01:07:34,373 --> 01:07:37,242
Black mamba, this is Budd.

747
01:07:37,317 --> 01:07:39,683
You know, before I picked
that little fella up,

748
01:07:39,748 --> 01:07:41,919
I looked him up on the Internet.

749
01:07:42,019 --> 01:07:45,053
Fascinating creature, the black mamba.

750
01:07:45,155 --> 01:07:46,464
Listen to this:

751
01:07:47,716 --> 01:07:48,643
(groans)

752
01:07:51,619 --> 01:07:53,757
"In Africa, the saying goes,

753
01:07:53,827 --> 01:07:57,853
"'ln the bush, an elephant can kill you,
a leopard can kill you,

754
01:07:57,923 --> 01:08:01,785
"'and a black mamba can kill you.
But only with the mamba,

755
01:08:01,859 --> 01:08:06,049
"and this has been true in Africa
since the dawn of time, is death sure.'

756
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:11,614
Hence its handle, 'Death Incarnate."'
Pretty cool, huh?

757
01:08:14,049 --> 01:08:17,627
"lts neurotoxic venom is one of
nature's most effective poisons,

758
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:20,926
"acting on the nervous system,
causing paralysis.

759
01:08:20,993 --> 01:08:24,376
"The venom of a black mamba
can kill a human being in four hours

760
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:27,068
"if, say, bitten on the ankle or the thumb.

761
01:08:27,137 --> 01:08:30,432
"However, a bite to the face or torso

762
01:08:30,497 --> 01:08:33,977
can bring death from paralysis
within 20 minutes."

763
01:08:34,049 --> 01:08:37,147
Now, you should listen to this,
'cause this concerns you.

764
01:08:38,912 --> 01:08:41,629
"The amount of venom that can be
delivered from a single bite

765
01:08:41,696 --> 01:08:44,762
can be gargantuan."

766
01:08:44,832 --> 01:08:47,287
You know, I've always liked
that word, "gargantuan."

767
01:08:47,392 --> 01:08:49,847
I so rarely have an opportunity
to use it in a sentence.

768
01:08:51,135 --> 01:08:53,404
"If not treated quickly with antivenom,

769
01:08:53,471 --> 01:08:56,188
"ten to 15 milligrams
can be fatal to human beings.

770
01:08:56,255 --> 01:08:58,710
"However, the black mamba can deliver

771
01:08:58,783 --> 01:09:03,387
as much as 100 to 400 milligrams
of venom from a single bite."

772
01:09:06,398 --> 01:09:09,246
Now...

773
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:13,653
...in these last agonizing
minutes of life you have left,

774
01:09:13,726 --> 01:09:16,541
let me answer that question
you asked earlier more thoroughly.

775
01:09:20,254 --> 01:09:22,709
Right at this moment...

776
01:09:22,813 --> 01:09:26,293
...the biggest "R" I feel is regret.

777
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:33,562
Regret that maybe
the greatest warrior I have ever met

778
01:09:33,629 --> 01:09:39,509
met her end at the hands
of a bushwhackin', scrub,

779
01:09:39,581 --> 01:09:43,290
alkie, piece of shit like you.

780
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:47,352
That woman deserved better.

781
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:50,169
(moans/stops moaning)

782
01:10:25,498 --> 01:10:26,676
(cell phone rings)

783
01:10:29,657 --> 01:10:30,704
Bill...

784
01:10:32,314 --> 01:10:34,223
...I have some tragic news.

785
01:10:35,385 --> 01:10:38,135
Your brother's dead.

786
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:39,924
I am so sorry, baby.

787
01:10:41,017 --> 01:10:43,351
She put a black mamba in his camper.

788
01:10:44,345 --> 01:10:46,167
I got her, sweetie.
She's dead.

789
01:10:49,176 --> 01:10:50,965
Let me put it this way:

790
01:10:51,032 --> 01:10:55,188
You ever start feeling sentimental,
go to Barstow, California.

791
01:10:55,288 --> 01:10:58,965
When you get here, walk into a florist
and buy a bunch of flowers.

792
01:10:59,032 --> 01:11:01,814
Then you take those flowers
to Huntington Cemetery

793
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:06,070
on Fuller and Guadalupe, look for
the headstone marked "Paula Schultz,"

794
01:11:06,135 --> 01:11:08,044
and lay them on the grave.

795
01:11:08,119 --> 01:11:13,814
'Cause you will be standing at the final
resting place of Beatrix Kiddo.

796
01:11:13,879 --> 01:11:16,268
- Marty Kitrosser?
- Here.

797
01:11:16,342 --> 01:11:18,098
- Melanie Harrhouse?
- Here.

798
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:20,533
- Beatrix Kiddo?
- Here.

799
01:11:20,598 --> 01:11:23,827
Look... I can be there
in about four hours.

800
01:11:23,894 --> 01:11:26,283
Do you want me to come over?

801
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:29,521
No, no, no, no.
You need me, baby, I'm there.

802
01:11:32,278 --> 01:11:34,961
OK. I'm leaving now.

803
01:11:35,029 --> 01:11:38,062
You go smoke some pot or somethin',
I'll be there soon.

804
01:11:52,436 --> 01:11:54,673
(grunting)

805
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:06,122
(grunting continues)

806
01:12:10,323 --> 01:12:12,047
(grunting continues)

807
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:38,865
Ugh.

808
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:40,239
Gross.

809
01:12:59,632 --> 01:13:02,447
(yelling)

810
01:13:34,511 --> 01:13:35,493
(grunts)

811
01:13:48,845 --> 01:13:50,569
Hi-ya!

812
01:13:59,917 --> 01:14:04,521
"To my brother, Budd.
The only man I ever loved. Bill."

813
01:14:15,755 --> 01:14:17,894
What's that?

814
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:21,706
Budd's Hanzo sword.

815
01:14:21,771 --> 01:14:24,160
He said he pawned it.

816
01:14:24,235 --> 01:14:27,715
Guess that makes him
a liar now, don't it?

817
01:14:31,243 --> 01:14:33,796
- Elle?
- Bea.

818
01:14:34,731 --> 01:14:37,665
Somethin' I've always
been curious about.

819
01:14:37,738 --> 01:14:41,251
Just between us girls...

820
01:14:41,354 --> 01:14:45,577
...what did you say to Pai Mei
to make him snatch out your eye?

821
01:14:45,642 --> 01:14:48,260
(screams) Ow!

822
01:14:49,162 --> 01:14:52,227
I called him a miserable old fool.

823
01:14:52,297 --> 01:14:56,225
Ooh. Bad idea.

824
01:14:57,353 --> 01:14:58,946
Know what I did?

825
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:03,040
I killed that miserable old fool.

826
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:07,713
(EIle) How do you like the fish head,
you miserable old fool?

827
01:15:07,784 --> 01:15:10,086
I poisoned his fish heads.

828
01:15:10,184 --> 01:15:13,479
Elle, you treacherous dog.

829
01:15:13,576 --> 01:15:16,358
(EIle laughs)

830
01:15:17,928 --> 01:15:20,132
I - give - you - my - word...

831
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,661
(EIle) And I told him,

832
01:15:21,735 --> 01:15:25,477
"To me, the word
of an old fool like you

833
01:15:25,543 --> 01:15:29,438
is worth less than nothing."

834
01:15:29,511 --> 01:15:30,940
(laughs)

835
01:15:34,151 --> 01:15:36,038
That's right.

836
01:15:36,103 --> 01:15:37,990
I killed your master.

837
01:15:38,054 --> 01:15:40,574
And now I'm gonna kill you, too.

838
01:15:40,646 --> 01:15:43,199
With your own sword, no less.

839
01:15:43,302 --> 01:15:49,281
Which, in the very immediate future,
will become my sword.

840
01:15:51,333 --> 01:15:53,308
Bitch...

841
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,869
...you don't have a future.

842
01:16:23,652 --> 01:16:26,172
(yelling)

843
01:16:36,547 --> 01:16:39,809
(screaming)

844
01:16:43,138 --> 01:16:45,375
(screaming) Fucking bitch!

845
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:49,595
(screaming) Fucking bitch!

846
01:16:56,962 --> 01:17:00,061
(screaming) I'll kill you!
You're fuckin' dead!

847
01:17:02,818 --> 01:17:05,371
(screaming) You bitch! You bitch!

848
01:17:05,441 --> 01:17:08,824
(moaning/screaming)

849
01:17:08,897 --> 01:17:11,896
I'll fucking kill you, you bitch!

850
01:17:11,968 --> 01:17:14,270
(hisses)

851
01:17:14,337 --> 01:17:18,527
(screaming) Oh, I'll get you!

852
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:21,439
I'm gonna...

853
01:17:21,504 --> 01:17:24,374
(screaming) Where are you?
Lemme fuckin' at you!

854
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,367
(continues screaming)

855
01:17:26,432 --> 01:17:30,076
Where are you?
I'm coming, you fucking bitch!

856
01:17:30,144 --> 01:17:32,893
(screaming) You're fucking dead!
You're dead!

857
01:17:32,959 --> 01:17:35,261
(continues screaming)

858
01:17:35,327 --> 01:17:38,010
(cries) Oh... shit!

859
01:17:40,671 --> 01:17:43,867
(screaming)

860
01:17:43,935 --> 01:17:47,829
(wind blowing)

861
01:17:59,294 --> 01:18:02,742
(# choral music)

862
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:38,649
(# male singing in Spanish)

863
01:19:01,755 --> 01:19:03,958
(the bride) Like most men
who never knew their father,

864
01:19:04,026 --> 01:19:06,677
Bill collected father figures.

865
01:19:06,746 --> 01:19:09,615
The first was Esteban Vihaio.

866
01:19:09,689 --> 01:19:13,584
Esteban was a pimp
and a friend of Bill's mother.

867
01:19:13,657 --> 01:19:17,585
He ran a brothel in Acuna, Mexico
for over 50 years.

868
01:19:17,657 --> 01:19:19,894
His army, the Acuna Boys,

869
01:19:19,961 --> 01:19:24,151
made up of the fatherless offspring
of his whores, ran Acuna.

870
01:19:24,217 --> 01:19:27,086
He ran the Acuna Boys.

871
01:19:28,313 --> 01:19:33,047
Now, at the age of 80, it would be
this retired gentleman of leisure

872
01:19:33,112 --> 01:19:36,014
who could point me in Bill's direction.

873
01:19:37,879 --> 01:19:40,148
Seor Esteban Vihaio?

874
01:19:41,623 --> 01:19:42,932
Yes.

875
01:19:42,999 --> 01:19:44,887
May I join you?

876
01:19:46,872 --> 01:19:49,938
Only on the condition
that you call me Esteban.

877
01:19:50,007 --> 01:19:54,000
- May I join you, Esteban?
- Please.

878
01:19:58,038 --> 01:19:59,980
Americana?

879
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:01,679
Yes.

880
01:20:01,782 --> 01:20:04,302
I speak a little Spanish, if you prefer.

881
01:20:04,406 --> 01:20:07,821
No, no, no, no.
I prefer English.

882
01:20:07,894 --> 01:20:10,315
I haven't spoken it in a while,

883
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:13,619
but I would relish
the opportunity to converse

884
01:20:13,686 --> 01:20:16,435
with such a pretty
companion as yourself.

885
01:20:16,501 --> 01:20:20,724
It's my pleasure to be in the company
of such a fine gentleman as yourself.

886
01:20:20,789 --> 01:20:23,604
I must warn you, young lady...

887
01:20:23,669 --> 01:20:26,516
...I am susceptible to flattery.

888
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:31,412
How may I be of service to you?

889
01:20:39,444 --> 01:20:41,070
Where's Bill?

890
01:20:43,348 --> 01:20:45,868
Ahh.

891
01:20:45,939 --> 01:20:47,881
You must be Beatrix.

892
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:51,947
I can see the attraction.

893
01:20:54,515 --> 01:20:59,633
I remember when Bill was only
five years old, I took him to the movies.

894
01:20:59,699 --> 01:21:03,244
It was a movie starring Lana Turner.

895
01:21:03,347 --> 01:21:08,168
The Postman Always Ring Twice,
with John Garfields.

896
01:21:08,274 --> 01:21:11,405
And whenever she would
appear on the screen,

897
01:21:11,474 --> 01:21:16,875
Bill would begin compulsively to
suck his thumb to an obscene amount.

898
01:21:16,946 --> 01:21:22,281
And I knew from this very moment,
this boy was a fool for blonds.

899
01:21:27,569 --> 01:21:29,576
Mmm.

900
01:21:29,649 --> 01:21:31,242
You know...

901
01:21:31,313 --> 01:21:34,957
...being a fool for a woman
such as yourself...

902
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:38,318
...is always the right thing to do.

903
01:21:40,241 --> 01:21:45,030
If we had met when I was
back in business...

904
01:21:45,104 --> 01:21:49,479
...you would have been
my number one lady.

905
01:21:51,792 --> 01:21:55,304
- Well, I'm flattered.
- You goddamn well better be.

906
01:21:57,583 --> 01:22:01,925
This... I heard you were driving a truck.

907
01:22:01,999 --> 01:22:03,854
My Pussy Wagon died on me.

908
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:07,717
The Pussy died. Hmm.

909
01:22:10,447 --> 01:22:13,130
Bill shot you in the head, no?

910
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:15,686
- Yes.
- Hmm.

911
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:19,877
I would have been much nicer.

912
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:22,154
I would have just cut your face.

913
01:22:25,102 --> 01:22:26,662
You must forgive me.

914
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:29,067
Please... you have a drink with me.

915
01:22:32,334 --> 01:22:36,359
Clara! (smooches)

916
01:22:37,869 --> 01:22:39,494
Coming.

917
01:22:42,156 --> 01:22:43,912
Dos aejo.

918
01:22:45,964 --> 01:22:47,044
(mumbles)

919
01:22:55,916 --> 01:22:57,345
Gracias.

920
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:05,346
What were we talking about?

921
01:23:11,467 --> 01:23:13,354
Bill.

922
01:23:15,050 --> 01:23:18,847
- Where's Bill?
- Where's Bill.

923
01:23:18,954 --> 01:23:21,343
Yeah. Hmm.

924
01:23:21,418 --> 01:23:26,655
Bill is at the Villa Quatro,
on the road to Salina.

925
01:23:26,730 --> 01:23:28,934
I will draw you a map.

926
01:23:30,409 --> 01:23:32,646
Bill is like a son to me.

927
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:38,047
- Do you know why I help you?
- No.

928
01:23:38,121 --> 01:23:39,975
Because he would want me to.

929
01:23:41,385 --> 01:23:43,752
Now, that I don't believe.

930
01:23:43,817 --> 01:23:46,151
Ahh.

931
01:23:46,216 --> 01:23:50,526
How else is he ever
going to see you again?

932
01:24:55,748 --> 01:24:57,309
Freeze, Mommy.

933
01:24:57,381 --> 01:24:59,290
Bang, bang! Oh!

934
01:24:59,364 --> 01:25:01,502
Oh! She got us, B.B.

935
01:25:01,572 --> 01:25:04,387
Mommy got us.
Oh, I'm dying!

936
01:25:04,452 --> 01:25:07,583
(groaning) I'm dying.

937
01:25:08,996 --> 01:25:12,312
Fall down, sweetheart.
Mommy shot us.

938
01:25:13,795 --> 01:25:20,058
But little did Quickdraw Kiddo know
that little B.B. was only playing possum,

939
01:25:20,163 --> 01:25:24,952
due to the fact that
she was impervious to bullets.

940
01:25:25,059 --> 01:25:27,001
I am pervious to bullets, Mommy.

941
01:25:27,106 --> 01:25:30,586
Hey, get back down there.
You're playing possum.

942
01:25:30,722 --> 01:25:36,123
So, as the smirking killer
advanced on what she thought

943
01:25:36,193 --> 01:25:41,408
was a bullet-ridden corpse,
that's when little B.B. fired.

944
01:25:43,585 --> 01:25:44,534
Bang, bang!

945
01:25:52,129 --> 01:25:56,187
You're dead, Mommy.
So die.

946
01:25:57,185 --> 01:25:58,646
Oh!

947
01:26:01,632 --> 01:26:02,614
B.B.

948
01:26:06,432 --> 01:26:10,109
Oh! B. B...

949
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:12,347
(grunts)

950
01:26:12,415 --> 01:26:15,415
I should've known.

951
01:26:15,488 --> 01:26:18,651
You are... the best.

952
01:26:25,375 --> 01:26:27,830
Oh, Mommy.
Don't die.

953
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:30,391
I was just playing.

954
01:26:35,422 --> 01:26:36,884
I know.

955
01:26:50,461 --> 01:26:53,308
I told her that you were asleep...

956
01:26:53,405 --> 01:26:58,074
...but that one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.

957
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:02,199
And she asked me, "If Mommy's
been asleep since I was born,

958
01:27:02,269 --> 01:27:04,854
then how will she know what I look like?"

959
01:27:04,924 --> 01:27:11,318
To which I replied, "Because
Mommy's been dreaming of you."

960
01:27:12,252 --> 01:27:15,034
That's what I said.

961
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:18,231
Did you dream of me?
I dreamed of you.

962
01:27:19,259 --> 01:27:22,804
Every single night, baby.
Every single night.

963
01:27:22,875 --> 01:27:25,810
I waited a long time
for you to wake up, Mommy.

964
01:27:37,498 --> 01:27:39,407
Now, let me look at you.

965
01:27:41,146 --> 01:27:42,323
Oh.

966
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:50,039
My, my, my,
what a pretty little girl you are.

967
01:27:50,106 --> 01:27:51,764
You're pretty too, Mommy.

968
01:27:57,913 --> 01:28:01,295
Tell Mommy what you said
when I showed you her picture.

969
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:02,415
Mnh-mnh.

970
01:28:02,521 --> 01:28:05,073
- Come on, shy girl.
- Mnh-mnh.

971
01:28:05,144 --> 01:28:07,697
Come on. You know what you said.

972
01:28:07,768 --> 01:28:11,859
Come on. Tell Mommy.
It'll make her feel good. Come on.

973
01:28:11,928 --> 01:28:14,262
- Mnh-mnh.
- Yeah. Come on.

974
01:28:14,328 --> 01:28:16,716
I said... I said,

975
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:22,738
"You're the most beautifulest woman
I ever saw in the whole wide world."

976
01:28:24,312 --> 01:28:27,923
That's the truth.
That's what she said.

977
01:28:28,599 --> 01:28:34,447
B.B., don't you think Mommy has the
prettiest hair in the whole wide world?

978
01:28:34,551 --> 01:28:38,195
- Yes, I do.
- Matter of fact, it's better than pretty.

979
01:28:39,606 --> 01:28:44,145
- What's better than pretty?
- Mmm... Gorgeous.

980
01:28:44,214 --> 01:28:48,818
Very good. Gorgeous.
Mommy is gorgeous.

981
01:28:51,573 --> 01:28:56,395
Hmm. You know, sweetie,
Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy.

982
01:28:56,469 --> 01:28:59,251
Why, Daddy?
Were you being a bad daddy?

983
01:28:59,317 --> 01:29:03,572
I'm afraid I was.
I was a real bad daddy.

984
01:29:05,077 --> 01:29:08,874
Our little girl learned about
life and death the other day.

985
01:29:08,981 --> 01:29:13,618
Wanna tell Mommy about
what happened to Emilio?

986
01:29:15,253 --> 01:29:18,067
I killed him.

987
01:29:18,132 --> 01:29:23,020
- Emilio was her goldfish.
- Emilio was my goldfiss.

988
01:29:23,091 --> 01:29:27,564
She came running into my room,
holding the fish in her hand and crying,

989
01:29:27,636 --> 01:29:30,483
"Daddy. Daddy.
Emilio's dead."

990
01:29:32,115 --> 01:29:36,010
And I said, "Really? That's so sad.

991
01:29:36,115 --> 01:29:38,188
How did he die?"

992
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:41,226
- And what did you say?
- I stepped on him.

993
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:46,349
Actually, young lady, the words
you so strategically used were,

994
01:29:46,419 --> 01:29:50,161
"I accidentally stepped on him."

995
01:29:50,226 --> 01:29:52,080
To which I queried,

996
01:29:52,146 --> 01:29:57,415
"And just how did your foot accidentally
find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?"

997
01:29:57,490 --> 01:30:01,581
And she said, "No, no, no. Emilio was
on the carpet when I stepped on him."

998
01:30:01,649 --> 01:30:05,424
Mmm. The plot thickens.

999
01:30:05,489 --> 01:30:10,158
"And just how did Emilio
get on the carpet?"

1000
01:30:10,225 --> 01:30:13,454
And Mommy, you would've been
so proud of her.

1001
01:30:15,792 --> 01:30:17,734
She didn't lie.

1002
01:30:17,808 --> 01:30:21,801
She said she took Emilio
out of his bowl...

1003
01:30:21,872 --> 01:30:25,255
...and put him on the carpet.

1004
01:30:26,736 --> 01:30:30,631
And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet?

1005
01:30:30,703 --> 01:30:32,459
Flapping.

1006
01:30:33,519 --> 01:30:37,163
- And then you stomped on him.
- Uh-huh.

1007
01:30:37,231 --> 01:30:40,875
And when you lifted up your foot...

1008
01:30:40,975 --> 01:30:44,837
...what was Emilio doing then?
- Nothing.

1009
01:30:44,942 --> 01:30:47,593
He stopped flapping, didn't he?

1010
01:30:49,998 --> 01:30:52,365
She told me later...

1011
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:54,634
...that the second she lifted up her foot

1012
01:30:54,702 --> 01:30:58,760
and saw Emilio not flapping,
she knew what she had done.

1013
01:30:58,830 --> 01:31:03,718
Is that not the perfect
visual image of life and death?

1014
01:31:03,789 --> 01:31:08,677
A fish flapping on the carpet,
and a fish not flapping on the carpet.

1015
01:31:10,765 --> 01:31:16,548
So powerful, even a four-year-old
with no concept of life or death...

1016
01:31:16,653 --> 01:31:19,173
...knew what it meant.

1017
01:31:19,852 --> 01:31:22,819
- You loved Emilio, didn't you?
- Uh-huh.

1018
01:31:22,892 --> 01:31:25,707
Well... I love Mommy, too.

1019
01:31:27,117 --> 01:31:29,255
But I did to Mommy
what you did to Emilio.

1020
01:31:29,324 --> 01:31:33,121
- You stomped on Mommy?
- Worse.

1021
01:31:33,196 --> 01:31:35,203
I shot Mommy.

1022
01:31:35,276 --> 01:31:38,309
Not pretend shooting
like we were just doing.

1023
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:39,973
I shot her for real.

1024
01:31:40,044 --> 01:31:42,410
Why? Did you want to see
what would happen?

1025
01:31:42,507 --> 01:31:47,046
No, I knew what would happen
to Mommy if I shot her.

1026
01:31:47,115 --> 01:31:51,425
What I didn't know was, when I shot
Mommy, what would happen to me.

1027
01:31:51,499 --> 01:31:55,011
- What happened?
- I was very sad.

1028
01:31:57,258 --> 01:31:59,397
And that's when I learned...

1029
01:31:59,466 --> 01:32:04,321
...some things, once you do,
they can never be undone.

1030
01:32:07,370 --> 01:32:12,290
- What happened to Mommy?
- Why don't you ask Mommy?

1031
01:32:12,361 --> 01:32:15,395
You OK, Mommy?
Did it hurt?

1032
01:32:15,497 --> 01:32:19,010
No, sweetie.

1033
01:32:19,113 --> 01:32:21,414
Doesn't hurt anymore.

1034
01:32:26,825 --> 01:32:28,734
Did it make you sick?

1035
01:32:30,025 --> 01:32:34,181
No. It made me sleep.

1036
01:32:34,248 --> 01:32:36,834
That's why I haven't been with you, B.B.
I've been asleep.

1037
01:32:36,904 --> 01:32:40,482
But you're awake now, Mommy. Right?

1038
01:32:40,552 --> 01:32:43,551
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.

1039
01:32:43,623 --> 01:32:48,674
B.B., would you like Mommy to watch
a video with you before sleepy time?

1040
01:32:48,775 --> 01:32:50,182
Uh-huh.

1041
01:32:50,247 --> 01:32:53,858
Mommy, do you wanna watch
a video with me before sleepy time?

1042
01:32:53,926 --> 01:32:56,512
Oh, yeah!
I would love to.

1043
01:32:56,583 --> 01:32:59,266
- Which one do you wanna watch?
- Shogun Assassin.

1044
01:32:59,334 --> 01:33:01,603
No, B.B.
Shogun Assassin is too long.

1045
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:05,499
- Mnh-mnh.
- No, it's not.

1046
01:33:05,574 --> 01:33:09,665
Well, then, I'll leave you ladies to it.

1047
01:33:16,294 --> 01:33:21,476
(boy) When I was little,
my father was famous.

1048
01:33:21,541 --> 01:33:25,698
He was the greatest samurai
in the empire.

1049
01:33:25,765 --> 01:33:28,928
And he was the shogun's decapitator.

1050
01:33:28,996 --> 01:33:34,047
He cut off the heads of 131 lords.

1051
01:33:34,116 --> 01:33:38,393
My father would come home to Mother
and when he would see her,

1052
01:33:38,468 --> 01:33:41,054
he would forget about the killings.

1053
01:33:41,124 --> 01:33:46,077
He wasn't scared of the shogun,
but the shogun was scared of him.

1054
01:33:46,148 --> 01:33:48,733
Maybe that was the problem.

1055
01:33:48,803 --> 01:33:51,520
One night, the shogun sent...

1056
01:33:51,651 --> 01:33:55,994
(# "About Her"by Malcolm McLaren)

1057
01:34:03,810 --> 01:34:08,927
# My man got a heart

1058
01:34:08,995 --> 01:34:15,770
# Like the rock that's in the sea

1059
01:34:21,474 --> 01:34:28,031
# Well, no one told me about her

1060
01:34:28,098 --> 01:34:30,945
# The way she lied

1061
01:34:33,377 --> 01:34:39,671
# Well, no one told me about her

1062
01:34:39,744 --> 01:34:42,908
# How many people cried

1063
01:34:51,391 --> 01:34:56,825
# My man got a heart

1064
01:34:56,927 --> 01:35:03,550
# Like the rock that's in the sea

1065
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:08,765
# My man got a heart

1066
01:35:08,830 --> 01:35:16,053
# Like the rock that's in the sea

1067
01:35:21,278 --> 01:35:27,835
# Well, no one told me about her

1068
01:35:27,933 --> 01:35:30,966
# The way she lied

1069
01:35:33,181 --> 01:35:39,476
# Well, no one told me about her

1070
01:35:39,548 --> 01:35:42,963
# How many people cried

1071
01:35:43,773 --> 01:35:49,653
# But it's too late to say you're sorry

1072
01:35:49,724 --> 01:35:52,179
# How would I know?

1073
01:35:52,252 --> 01:35:55,896
# Why should I care?

1074
01:35:55,963 --> 01:36:01,397
# Please don't bother trying to find her

1075
01:36:01,499 --> 01:36:06,006
# She's not there

1076
01:36:07,483 --> 01:36:10,265
I was just admiring your sword.

1077
01:36:10,331 --> 01:36:13,713
Quite a piece of work.

1078
01:36:13,787 --> 01:36:17,845
Speaking of which, how is Hanzo-san?

1079
01:36:18,362 --> 01:36:19,769
He's good.

1080
01:36:21,754 --> 01:36:24,601
Has his sushi gotten any better?

1081
01:36:27,610 --> 01:36:32,214
You know, I couldn't believe it.
You got him to make you a sword.

1082
01:36:32,313 --> 01:36:36,405
It was easy.
I just dropped your name, Bill.

1083
01:36:36,474 --> 01:36:38,481
That'd do it.

1084
01:36:51,129 --> 01:36:56,911
# Well, no one told me about her

1085
01:37:02,967 --> 01:37:07,407
# Well, no one told me about her

1086
01:37:08,439 --> 01:37:13,490
I suppose the idea is we cross
Hanzo swords. Am I right?

1087
01:37:15,415 --> 01:37:16,975
Well,

1088
01:37:17,047 --> 01:37:22,065
it just so happens this hacienda
has its own private beach.

1089
01:37:22,135 --> 01:37:26,160
And that private beach just so happens
to look particularly beautiful

1090
01:37:26,230 --> 01:37:29,100
bathed in moonlight.

1091
01:37:29,173 --> 01:37:31,857
And there just so happens to be
a full moon out tonight.

1092
01:37:31,926 --> 01:37:38,417
So, swordfighter, if you want
a swordfight, that's where I suggest.

1093
01:37:39,062 --> 01:37:42,542
But if you wanna be old school about it...

1094
01:37:42,613 --> 01:37:46,093
...and you know
I'm all about old school...

1095
01:37:46,165 --> 01:37:49,710
...then we could wait until dawn
and slice each other up at sunrise

1096
01:37:49,781 --> 01:37:51,952
like a couple of real-life honest...

1097
01:37:54,132 --> 01:37:58,834
Now, if you don't settle down, I'm gonna
have to put one in your kneecap.

1098
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:02,064
And I hear tell that's
a very painful place to get shot in.

1099
01:38:04,084 --> 01:38:07,662
(laughing) I'm just fuckin' with you.

1100
01:38:09,491 --> 01:38:11,498
Now...

1101
01:38:11,604 --> 01:38:14,025
...when it comes to you...

1102
01:38:14,131 --> 01:38:16,019
...and us...

1103
01:38:17,587 --> 01:38:20,620
...I have a few unanswered questions.

1104
01:38:20,691 --> 01:38:26,888
So, before this tale of bloody revenge
reaches its climax,

1105
01:38:26,963 --> 01:38:32,014
I'm gonna ask you some questions,
and I want you to tell me the truth.

1106
01:38:32,082 --> 01:38:36,140
However, therein lies a dilemma.

1107
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:38,599
Because when it comes
to the subject of me,

1108
01:38:38,705 --> 01:38:43,855
I believe you are truly and utterly
incapable of telling the truth.

1109
01:38:43,921 --> 01:38:48,078
Especially to me.
And least of all, to yourself.

1110
01:38:48,145 --> 01:38:51,493
And when it comes to the subject of me,

1111
01:38:51,569 --> 01:38:58,093
I am truly and utterly incapable
of believing anything you say.

1112
01:38:58,160 --> 01:39:00,102
How do you suppose
we solve this dilemma?

1113
01:39:00,176 --> 01:39:01,867
Well,

1114
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:03,845
it just so happens,

1115
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,960
I have a solution.

1116
01:39:06,032 --> 01:39:08,366
- Aah!
- Gotcha!

1117
01:39:08,432 --> 01:39:10,504
(grunting) Goddamn!

1118
01:39:10,608 --> 01:39:12,877
(laughs)

1119
01:39:12,944 --> 01:39:16,205
What the fuck
did you just shoot me with?

1120
01:39:16,272 --> 01:39:19,850
My greatest invention.
Or at least my favorite.

1121
01:39:20,591 --> 01:39:23,340
Don't touch it, or I'll stick another one
right in your cheek.

1122
01:39:27,887 --> 01:39:33,899
What lies within that dart, just begging
to course its way through your veins...

1123
01:39:33,966 --> 01:39:38,308
...is an incredibly potent
and quite infallible truth serum.

1124
01:39:38,382 --> 01:39:41,382
I call it "The Undisputed Truth."

1125
01:39:41,454 --> 01:39:46,668
Twice as strong as sodium pentothal,
with no druggie aftereffects.

1126
01:39:46,765 --> 01:39:52,264
Except for a slight wave of euphoria.
You feel it?

1127
01:39:52,333 --> 01:39:55,202
- Euphoria?
- Yeah.

1128
01:39:55,277 --> 01:39:58,124
- No.
- Too bad.

1129
01:39:59,213 --> 01:40:01,417
As you know...

1130
01:40:01,485 --> 01:40:04,801
...l'm quite keen on comic books.

1131
01:40:05,581 --> 01:40:08,330
Especially the ones about superheroes.

1132
01:40:08,396 --> 01:40:13,731
I find the whole mythology
surrounding superheroes fascinating.

1133
01:40:13,835 --> 01:40:18,210
Take my favorite superhero, Superman.

1134
01:40:18,316 --> 01:40:21,218
Not a great comic book.
Not particularly well-drawn.

1135
01:40:22,827 --> 01:40:24,452
Mmm.

1136
01:40:24,523 --> 01:40:26,825
But the mythology...

1137
01:40:26,891 --> 01:40:30,120
The mythology is not only great,
it's unique.

1138
01:40:30,187 --> 01:40:34,278
How long does this shit take
to go into effect?

1139
01:40:34,346 --> 01:40:38,121
About two minutes. Just long enough
for me to finish my point.

1140
01:40:38,186 --> 01:40:43,106
Now, a staple of the superhero
mythology is,

1141
01:40:43,178 --> 01:40:46,080
there's the superhero
and there's the alter ego.

1142
01:40:46,186 --> 01:40:50,212
Batman is actually Bruce Wayne,
Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker.

1143
01:40:51,369 --> 01:40:55,046
When that character wakes up
in the morning, he's Peter Parker.

1144
01:40:55,113 --> 01:41:00,066
He has to put on a costume
to become Spider-Man.

1145
01:41:00,137 --> 01:41:05,734
And it is in that characteristic
Superman stands alone.

1146
01:41:05,801 --> 01:41:08,518
Superman didn't become Superman.

1147
01:41:08,585 --> 01:41:11,170
Superman was born Superman.

1148
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:15,396
When Superman wakes up
in the morning, he's Superman.

1149
01:41:15,464 --> 01:41:17,886
His alter ego is Clark Kent.

1150
01:41:18,888 --> 01:41:21,888
His outfit with the big red "S" -

1151
01:41:21,991 --> 01:41:25,504
that's the blanket he was wrapped in
as a baby when the Kents found him.

1152
01:41:25,575 --> 01:41:28,324
Those are his clothes.

1153
01:41:28,392 --> 01:41:33,410
What Kent wears - the glasses,
the business suit - that's the costume.

1154
01:41:33,479 --> 01:41:39,392
That's the costume Superman wears
to blend in with us.

1155
01:41:39,463 --> 01:41:42,724
Clark Kent is how Superman views us.

1156
01:41:42,791 --> 01:41:45,922
And what are the characteristics
of Clark Kent?

1157
01:41:45,990 --> 01:41:48,226
He's weak...

1158
01:41:48,294 --> 01:41:51,044
...he's unsure of himself...

1159
01:41:51,141 --> 01:41:52,767
...he's a coward.

1160
01:41:53,798 --> 01:41:58,532
Clark Kent is Superman's critique
on the whole human race.

1161
01:42:00,230 --> 01:42:04,769
Sorta like Beatrix Kiddo
and Mrs. Tommy Plimpton.

1162
01:42:05,925 --> 01:42:08,064
Aso.

1163
01:42:08,133 --> 01:42:10,238
The point emerges.

1164
01:42:11,877 --> 01:42:15,259
You would've worn the costume
of Arlene Plimpton.

1165
01:42:15,333 --> 01:42:18,944
But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.

1166
01:42:19,012 --> 01:42:23,769
And every morning when you woke up,
you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.

1167
01:42:23,875 --> 01:42:25,915
Oh, you can... take the needle out.

1168
01:42:32,995 --> 01:42:35,166
Are you calling me a superhero?

1169
01:42:35,235 --> 01:42:37,275
I'm calling you a killer.

1170
01:42:37,347 --> 01:42:40,129
A natural born killer.

1171
01:42:40,194 --> 01:42:43,674
You always have been,
and you always will be.

1172
01:42:43,746 --> 01:42:45,885
Moving to El Paso...

1173
01:42:45,954 --> 01:42:49,215
...working in a used record store...

1174
01:42:49,283 --> 01:42:51,704
...goin' to the movies with Tommy...

1175
01:42:51,778 --> 01:42:53,207
...clipping coupons.

1176
01:42:53,282 --> 01:42:55,037
That's you...

1177
01:42:55,138 --> 01:42:58,454
...trying to disguise yourself
as a worker bee.

1178
01:42:58,562 --> 01:43:01,431
That's you tryin' to blend in with the hive.

1179
01:43:01,537 --> 01:43:03,839
But you're not a worker bee.

1180
01:43:04,801 --> 01:43:07,518
You're a renegade killer bee.

1181
01:43:07,585 --> 01:43:10,268
And no matter how much beer you drank
or barbecue you ate

1182
01:43:10,337 --> 01:43:13,501
or how fat your ass got,

1183
01:43:13,569 --> 01:43:17,278
nothing in the world
would ever change that.

1184
01:43:19,616 --> 01:43:21,558
First question:

1185
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:28,830
Did you really think your life in El Paso
was gonna work?

1186
01:43:34,336 --> 01:43:36,190
No!

1187
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:42,101
But I would've had B.B.!

1188
01:43:42,175 --> 01:43:44,761
Don't get me wrong.

1189
01:43:44,831 --> 01:43:48,573
I think you would have been
a wonderful mother.

1190
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:51,060
But you are a killer.

1191
01:43:55,038 --> 01:43:57,689
All those people you killed to get to me...

1192
01:43:57,790 --> 01:44:00,157
...felt damn good, didn't they?

1193
01:44:02,238 --> 01:44:04,605
Yes.

1194
01:44:04,669 --> 01:44:06,873
Every single one of them?

1195
01:44:16,733 --> 01:44:18,391
Yes.

1196
01:44:21,596 --> 01:44:24,084
That was the warmup round.

1197
01:44:24,157 --> 01:44:29,241
Now comes the $64,000 question.

1198
01:44:35,676 --> 01:44:39,123
Why did you run away
from me with my baby?

1199
01:44:42,812 --> 01:44:46,107
Do you remember the last assignment
you sent me on?

1200
01:44:46,171 --> 01:44:48,505
Of course.

1201
01:44:48,571 --> 01:44:50,513
Lisa Wong.

1202
01:44:51,803 --> 01:44:54,258
The morning I left, I was sick.

1203
01:44:55,866 --> 01:44:58,387
On the plane, I threw up.

1204
01:45:00,154 --> 01:45:03,896
So I started thinking:

1205
01:45:03,962 --> 01:45:06,002
Maybe I was pregnant.

1206
01:45:06,105 --> 01:45:10,360
"Easy to use. Remove cap and urinate
on the absorbent end for five seconds.

1207
01:45:12,473 --> 01:45:14,862
"Accurate results in only 90 seconds.

1208
01:45:14,938 --> 01:45:18,286
You can read the results as soon as
the line appears in the window."

1209
01:45:18,361 --> 01:45:19,408
(sighs)

1210
01:45:19,481 --> 01:45:21,620
(clock ticking)

1211
01:45:53,207 --> 01:45:54,189
Fuck.

1212
01:45:54,263 --> 01:45:56,335
(the bride) What I didn't know...

1213
01:45:56,407 --> 01:46:00,301
...was that somewhere on my journey
I had been spotted.

1214
01:46:00,374 --> 01:46:06,222
With me in L.A., it didn't take Lisa Wong
long to send an assassin of her own.

1215
01:46:06,327 --> 01:46:08,912
- (doorbell)
- (the bride) Hello, can I help you?

1216
01:46:09,014 --> 01:46:12,210
(woman) Hello, I'm Karen Kim.
I'm the hospitality manager of the hotel.

1217
01:46:12,278 --> 01:46:14,001
I have a welcome gift
from the management.

1218
01:46:14,069 --> 01:46:17,135
Oh, that's nice. Um...

1219
01:46:17,205 --> 01:46:19,115
Can you just leave it by the door?

1220
01:46:31,029 --> 01:46:34,095
- You pretty good with that shotgun?
- Not that I have to be at this range,

1221
01:46:34,165 --> 01:46:35,987
but I'm a fuckin' surgeon
with this shotgun.

1222
01:46:36,052 --> 01:46:38,987
Well, guess what, bitch?
I'm better than Annie Oakley.

1223
01:46:39,092 --> 01:46:42,354
- And I got you right in my sight.
- I could blow your fuckin' head off.

1224
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:46,413
Not before I put one
right between your eyes, so let's talk.

1225
01:46:48,019 --> 01:46:50,092
Karen...

1226
01:46:51,955 --> 01:46:54,191
...I just found out...

1227
01:46:54,259 --> 01:46:56,147
...right now...

1228
01:46:56,211 --> 01:47:01,927
...not a moment before
you blew a hole through the door...

1229
01:47:02,003 --> 01:47:04,753
...that I'm pregnant.
- What is this?

1230
01:47:06,195 --> 01:47:08,912
On the floor by the door...

1231
01:47:08,978 --> 01:47:11,977
...is a strip that says I'm pregnant.

1232
01:47:12,082 --> 01:47:13,162
Bullshit.

1233
01:47:14,418 --> 01:47:17,931
Any other time
you'd be 100 percent right.

1234
01:47:18,002 --> 01:47:20,751
This time...

1235
01:47:20,817 --> 01:47:22,759
...you're 100 percent wrong.

1236
01:47:25,138 --> 01:47:28,585
I'm the deadliest woman in the world.

1237
01:47:28,657 --> 01:47:30,762
But right now...

1238
01:47:30,833 --> 01:47:33,102
...l'm just scared shitless for my baby.

1239
01:47:33,936 --> 01:47:35,846
Please.

1240
01:47:36,913 --> 01:47:39,214
Just look at the strip.

1241
01:47:41,201 --> 01:47:42,859
Please.

1242
01:47:44,144 --> 01:47:48,683
Stay where you are and don't move.

1243
01:48:05,166 --> 01:48:07,435
I don't know what this fuckin' shit means.

1244
01:48:07,503 --> 01:48:09,804
The box with the directions -
it's right there.

1245
01:48:21,102 --> 01:48:22,662
"Easy to use.

1246
01:48:22,734 --> 01:48:27,109
Remove the cap and urinate
on the absorbent end."

1247
01:48:27,182 --> 01:48:28,775
Blue means pregnant.

1248
01:48:29,550 --> 01:48:31,459
I'll read it myself, thank you.

1249
01:48:38,061 --> 01:48:40,875
Oh, OK.

1250
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:43,079
Say I were to believe you.
What then?

1251
01:48:43,149 --> 01:48:45,669
Just go home.

1252
01:48:46,764 --> 01:48:48,739
I'll do the same.

1253
01:48:53,644 --> 01:48:55,531
(door opens)

1254
01:49:07,563 --> 01:49:09,089
Congratulations.

1255
01:49:12,618 --> 01:49:15,302
(the bride) Before that strip turned blue...

1256
01:49:15,371 --> 01:49:18,687
...I was a woman, I was your woman.

1257
01:49:18,763 --> 01:49:22,079
I was a killer who killed for you.

1258
01:49:22,186 --> 01:49:25,121
Before that strip turned blue,
I would've jumped a motorcycle

1259
01:49:25,226 --> 01:49:28,095
onto a speeding train.

1260
01:49:28,169 --> 01:49:30,079
For you.

1261
01:49:31,338 --> 01:49:34,567
But once that strip turned blue...

1262
01:49:34,634 --> 01:49:37,982
...I could no longer do
any of those things.

1263
01:49:38,057 --> 01:49:40,424
Not anymore.

1264
01:49:40,489 --> 01:49:42,944
Because I was gonna be a mother.

1265
01:49:45,929 --> 01:49:47,619
Can you understand that?

1266
01:49:50,728 --> 01:49:53,183
Yes.

1267
01:49:53,288 --> 01:49:55,328
But why didn't you...

1268
01:49:55,432 --> 01:49:58,465
...tell me then, instead of now?

1269
01:49:58,535 --> 01:50:00,739
Once you knew, you'd claim her.

1270
01:50:00,807 --> 01:50:02,717
And I didn't want that.

1271
01:50:03,432 --> 01:50:05,570
Not your decision to make.

1272
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:07,679
Yes.

1273
01:50:07,751 --> 01:50:11,842
But it's the right decision,
and I made it for my daughter.

1274
01:50:11,911 --> 01:50:16,384
She deserved to be born
with a clean slate.

1275
01:50:16,455 --> 01:50:18,310
But with you...

1276
01:50:18,375 --> 01:50:22,335
...she would've been born
into a world she shouldn't have.

1277
01:50:23,814 --> 01:50:26,847
I had to choose.

1278
01:50:26,950 --> 01:50:28,837
I chose her.

1279
01:50:31,334 --> 01:50:34,017
You know, five years ago,

1280
01:50:34,086 --> 01:50:38,755
if I had to make a list of impossible
things that could never happen,

1281
01:50:38,821 --> 01:50:44,222
you performing a coup de grce on me
by bustin' a cap in my crown...

1282
01:50:46,532 --> 01:50:49,085
...would've been right
at the top of the list.

1283
01:50:50,693 --> 01:50:52,634
I'd have been wrong, wouldn't I?

1284
01:50:53,924 --> 01:50:55,779
I-I'm sorry.

1285
01:50:55,844 --> 01:50:57,851
Was that a question?

1286
01:50:59,076 --> 01:51:01,596
Of impossible things
that could never happen -

1287
01:51:01,668 --> 01:51:04,767
yes, in this instance,
you would've been wrong.

1288
01:51:05,635 --> 01:51:06,650
Well?

1289
01:51:07,619 --> 01:51:10,205
When you never came back,

1290
01:51:10,276 --> 01:51:16,124
I naturally assumed Lisa Wong,
or somebody else, had killed you.

1291
01:51:16,195 --> 01:51:19,293
Oh! And for the record...

1292
01:51:19,363 --> 01:51:23,389
...letting somebody think somebody
they love is dead when they're not

1293
01:51:23,459 --> 01:51:25,368
is quite cruel.

1294
01:51:28,674 --> 01:51:32,383
I mourned you for three months.

1295
01:51:33,154 --> 01:51:37,344
And in the third month of mourning you...

1296
01:51:37,409 --> 01:51:39,678
...I tracked you down.

1297
01:51:39,745 --> 01:51:41,785
I wasn't tryin' to track you down.

1298
01:51:41,857 --> 01:51:47,072
I was tryin' to track down
the fucking assholes I thought killed you.

1299
01:51:47,137 --> 01:51:50,486
So I find you...

1300
01:51:50,561 --> 01:51:52,666
...and what do I find?

1301
01:51:52,737 --> 01:51:55,933
Not only are you not dead...

1302
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,895
...you're getting married
to some fucking jerk.

1303
01:52:02,144 --> 01:52:04,533
And you're pregnant.

1304
01:52:07,744 --> 01:52:10,013
I overreacted.

1305
01:52:18,239 --> 01:52:21,883
You overreacted?
Is that your explanation?

1306
01:52:21,951 --> 01:52:24,285
I didn't say I was gonna explain myself.

1307
01:52:24,351 --> 01:52:26,685
I said I was gonna tell you the truth.

1308
01:52:27,230 --> 01:52:31,027
But if that's too cryptic, let's get literal.

1309
01:52:33,406 --> 01:52:35,773
I'm a killer.

1310
01:52:35,870 --> 01:52:38,652
I'm a murdering bastard.
You know that.

1311
01:52:39,230 --> 01:52:42,077
And there are consequences...

1312
01:52:42,142 --> 01:52:46,233
...to breaking the heart
of a murdering bastard.

1313
01:52:46,302 --> 01:52:48,757
You experienced some of them.

1314
01:52:52,126 --> 01:52:55,573
Was my reaction really that surprising?

1315
01:52:55,645 --> 01:52:59,190
Yes. It was.

1316
01:53:01,501 --> 01:53:05,112
Could you do what you did?

1317
01:53:05,213 --> 01:53:08,791
Of course you could.

1318
01:53:08,860 --> 01:53:14,969
But I never thought you would,
or could, do that to me.

1319
01:53:15,036 --> 01:53:17,937
I'm really sorry, Kiddo...

1320
01:53:18,011 --> 01:53:20,084
...but you thought wrong.

1321
01:53:26,075 --> 01:53:30,036
You and I have unfinished business.

1322
01:53:30,875 --> 01:53:34,039
Baby... you ain't kiddin'.

1327
01:54:17,848 --> 01:54:19,790
Why didn't you tell me?

1328
01:54:23,512 --> 01:54:25,486
I don't know.

1329
01:54:27,799 --> 01:54:30,614
Because I'm...

1330
01:54:30,679 --> 01:54:33,646
...a bad person.

1331
01:54:33,719 --> 01:54:35,726
No.

1332
01:54:37,111 --> 01:54:40,046
You're not a bad person.

1333
01:54:40,150 --> 01:54:42,997
You're a terrific person.

1334
01:54:43,094 --> 01:54:45,461
You're my favorite person.

1335
01:54:47,318 --> 01:54:51,060
But every once in a while...

1336
01:54:51,126 --> 01:54:53,035

1337

1338
01:55:28,755 --> 01:55:31,951

1339

Well, well, well.

America and all the ships at sea.

Let's go to press. Flash.

Do you have a magpie in your home?

1343
01:57:30,220 --> 01:57:32,489
If you do, you are most fortunate.

1344
01:57:32,556 --> 01:57:36,069
The magpie is the most
charming bird in all the world.

1345
01:57:36,140 --> 01:57:38,506
He is the best friend a farmer ever had.

1346
01:57:38,572 --> 01:57:41,506
Treat him gently.
Treat him kindly.

1347
01:57:41,579 --> 01:57:45,856
And always remember,
the magpie deserves your respect.

1349
