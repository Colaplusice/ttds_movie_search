1
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:50,234
"Velazquez, past the age of 50,
no longer painted specific objects.

2
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:54,363
He drifted around things
like the air, like twilight,

3
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:59,076
catching unawares in the shimmering shadows
the nuances of color

4
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:03,956
that he transformed into the invisible
core of his silent symphony.

5
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,584
Henceforth, he captured only

6
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:11,714
those mysterious interpenetrations
that united shape and tone

7
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,509
by means of a secret
but unceasing progression

8
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:19,972
that no convulsion or cataclysm
could interrupt or impede.

9
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,724
Space reigns supreme.

10
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,062
It's as if some ethereal wave
skimming over surfaces

11
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,858
soaked up their visible emanations
to shape them and give them form

12
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,986
and then spread them
like a perfume,

13
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,239
like an echo of themselves,

14
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:40,993
like some imperceptible dust,
over every surrounding surface.

15
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,372
The world he lived in
was a sad one:

16
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,167
a degenerate king,
sickly infantes,

17
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:52,338
idiots, dwarfs, cripples,

18
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,716
clownish freaks
dressed as princes

19
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,761
whose job it was
to laugh at themselves

20
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:02,181
and amuse a court
that lived outside the law,

21
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,769
caught in a web
of etiquette, plots and lies,

22
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:10,356
bound by the confessional
and their own remorse.

23
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:15,361
Outside the gates,
the auto-da-fé and silence... "

24
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,116
Listen to this, little girl.

25
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,745
"A spirit of nostalgia prevails,

26
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,373
yet we see none
of the ugliness or sadness,

27
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:31,252
none of the gloom or cruelty
of this crushed childhood.

28
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,883
Velázquez is the painter
of the evening,

29
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,720
of open spaces and of silence,

30
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:45,808
even when he paints
in broad daylight or in a closed room,

31
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:49,562
even with the din of battle
or of the hunt in his ears.

32
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,899
As they seldom
went out during the day,

33
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,068
when everything was drowned
in torrid sunshine,

34
00:03:56,278 --> 00:04:00,072
Spanish painters
communed with the evening. "

35
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,491
Beautiful, isn't it, little girl?

36
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,202
You're crazy to read her
things like that.

37
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,581
Off to bed, sleepyhead!

38
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,750
Why hasn't Odile
put them to bed?

39
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:14,253
Because monsieur
let her go off to the movies

40
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,506
for the third time this week.

41
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:21,052
"The third time this week. "
Of course I did.

42
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:24,513
They're showing Johnny Guitar.
Good for her education.

43
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,682
There are
too many idiots around.

44
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,395
Hurry up. Frank and Paola
will be here any minute.

45
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,357
I'm not going.
I'm staying home with the kids.

46
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,735
No! Frank's bringing his niece.

47
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,821
She can baby-sit
till we get back.

48
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,616
She's a student.
She does it all the time.

49
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,828
His niece?
Knowing him, it's a call girl.

50
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,497
I'm not going.

51
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,792
You'll do as you're told.

52
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,546
Papa will introduce you
to the managing director of Standard Oil.

53
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,758
And I'll sue the TV people
for firing me.

54
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:04,261
No, you won't.
You'd only lose.

55
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:08,641
And when someone finds you work,
you'll be good enough to take it.

56
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,935
That's enough now.
Come on.

57
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,150
You're not wearing a slip?

58
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,072
No, I'm wearing my new
"Scandale" girdle. It's invisible.

59
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,868
"I've got that young look
with my 'Scandale' girdle!"

60
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,705
First there was Greek civilization.

61
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,124
Then there was the Renaissance.

62
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,669
Now we're entering
the Age of the Ass.

63
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,421
I'll show you around.

64
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,131
She loves children.

65
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,926
You can reach us at -
What's the number?

66
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,095
225-70-01.

67
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,973
- This is Frank's niece.
- Oh?

68
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,518
Good evening.

69
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:56,981
Hi.

70
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:00,776
Can't you say "BALzac 70-01 "?
You don't know Balzac?

71
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:05,531
Read César Birotteau, how the Fifth
Symphony pounded in his poor head.

72
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,951
- What's eating you?
- Let's go, daddy-o.

73
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,411
Chapter Two.

74
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:14,498
Surprise party at the home of
my wife's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Expresso.

75
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,376
The Alfa Romeo
has great acceleration,

76
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,171
powerful four-wheel
disc brakes,

77
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:23,340
a luxurious interior,
and great traction.

78
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,718
It's an exceptional touring car.

79
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,888
It's safe, fast
and a pleasure to drive,

80
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,557
with great response
and perfect balance.

81
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,977
It's easy to stay fresh.

82
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,397
Soap washes, cologne refreshes,
perfume perfumes.

83
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,484
To combat underarm perspiration,

84
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:45,112
I use Printil after my bath
for all-day protection.

85
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,948
It comes
in a wonderfully fresh aerosol,

86
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,743
as well as stick and roll-on.

87
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,747
But the Oldsmobile Rocket 88
has even more to offer.

88
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,000
Its meticulous design,

89
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,586
its powerful yet simple lines,

90
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,172
and its uncommon elegance
all prove

91
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,717
that beauty isn't incompatible
with top performance.

92
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,679
You look lonely.

93
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,437
He's American.
He doesn't speak French.

94
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,274
What's his name?
What's he do?

95
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,335
Baudelaire. Very good.

96
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,135
I've always wanted to know
exactly what cinema is.

97
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,007
My hairdo

98
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:32,595
stayed light and soft all day
thanks to Elnett Satin Spray.

99
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:38,809
And now the spray brushes out
effortlessly, like it was never there.

100
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,187
Soft.

101
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:48,110
My hair is like
strands of golden silk...

102
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,946
shining...

103
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,532
and clean.

104
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,076
Women must give up

105
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:59,747
filmy negligees
and romantic nightgowns.

106
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:06,629
Outdoors or in bright light, lingerie
loses its allure and becomes indecent.

107
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,095
Olympio's melancholy.

108
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,602
Give me the keys
to the Lincoln.

109
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,437
You're not staying?

110
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,481
No, I'm tired.

111
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,236
I've got a mechanism
for seeing called eyes,

112
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,322
for hearing called ears,

113
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,532
for speaking
called a mouth.

114
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,161
But they feel disconnected.

115
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,205
They don't work together.

116
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,792
A person should feel
like he's one individual.

117
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,962
I feel like
I'm many different people.

118
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,884
You talk too much.
It tires me out just listening to you.

119
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,470
You're right.
I talk too much.

120
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,306
A man alone
always talks too much.

121
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,978
I'll wait for you at home.

122
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,693
Next chapter:

123
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,902
Despair...

124
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,320
Memory and Freedom...

125
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,490
Bitterness... Hope...

126
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,534
Remembrance of Things Past.

127
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,453
Marianne Renoir.

128
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,463
You're still here?

129
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,267
Sorry.

130
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,687
You missed the last train.
How will you get home?

131
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,230
I don't know.

132
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,900
You're all alone?

133
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,820
I was bored, so I came home.

134
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,824
Anything wrong?
You look depressed.

135
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:04,038
Some days are like that.
Everyone you meet is an imbecile.

136
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,499
So you start
looking in the mirror

137
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,336
and wondering about yourself.

138
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,088
Come on.
I'll take you home.

139
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,311
Frank lent you his car?

140
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,856
Yeah. Why?
Don't you like American cars?

141
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,691
Sure.

142
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,237
Funny, our meeting
again like this.

143
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:42,117
- It's been four years.
- No, 51/2.

144
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,244
It was in October.

145
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,830
You're married now?

146
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:50,876
Yes, to an Italian with money.
But she doesn't really interest me.

147
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:55,464
- Why don't you divorce?
- I wanted to, but I've grown too lazy.

148
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:59,343
Like you pointed out once:

149
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,346
To want something,
you have to be alive.

150
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,391
Do you still teach Spanish?

151
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:09,436
No, I was in television,
but I gave it up.

152
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,732
What about you?
- Oh, nothing special.

153
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,194
You don't feel
like talking about yourself.

154
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:20,197
A friend of mine saw you
in London two years ago.

155
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,449
Are you still
with that American?

156
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,868
No, that ended a long time ago.

157
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:28,080
Have you known Frank long?

158
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,625
Not really. Just casually.

159
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,086
Mysterious as ever, I see.

160
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:38,257
Like I said, I just don't like
talking about myself.

161
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:41,009
Very well. Silence, then.

162
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:52,312
...a garrison massacred
by the Viet Cong,

163
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,606
who also lost 115 men.

164
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,360
Awful, isn't it?
It's so anonymous.

165
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,778
What is?

166
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:04,199
They say "115 guerrillas,"
and it means nothing to us.

167
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:09,288
But each one is a man,
and we don't even know who he is,

168
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,707
if he loves a woman,
if he has kids,

169
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,960
if he prefers movies or plays.

170
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:19,590
We know nothing about them.
All they say is "115 killed. "

171
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:24,303
It's like photographs.
They've always fascinated me.

172
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:29,516
You see this frozen image of a guy
with a caption underneath.

173
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,352
Maybe he was a coward.
Maybe he was a nice guy.

174
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,897
But at the moment it was taken,

175
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:39,443
no one can really say who he was,
what he was thinking about.

176
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,404
His wife? His mistress?

177
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,324
The past? The future?
Basketball?

178
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,701
No one will ever know.

179
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,497
That's life for you.

180
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:56,168
That's what makes me sad:
Life is so different from books.

181
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,463
I wish it were the same:

182
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,176
clear, logical, organized.

183
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,970
Only it isn't.

184
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:11,308
Yes, it is.
Much more than people think.

185
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,268
No, Pierrot.

186
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:16,813
For the last time,
my name's Ferdinand.

187
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:21,026
I know, but you can't sing
My friend Ferdinand

188
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:25,364
Yes, you can.
You just have to want to, Marianne.

189
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,283
I want to.

190
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,745
I'll do anything you want.

191
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,541
Me too, Marianne.

192
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,004
I'm putting my hand
on your knee.

193
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,132
Me too, Marianne.

194
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,721
I'm kissing you all over.

195
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,600
Me too, Marianne.

196
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,733
You're so beautiful, my pet

197
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,656
We'll see.

198
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,617
Marianne Renoir.

199
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,218
On your feet, dead man!

200
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,635
- You see? I was right.
- About what?

201
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,220
You didn't believe
we'd always be in love.

202
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:16,725
No, I never told you
I'd love you forever.

203
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,810
Oh, my love

204
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:24,816
You never promised
to adore me all your life

205
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,613
We never exchanged
such promises

206
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:33,200
Knowing me
knowing you

207
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:38,288
We never thought
we'd be caught in love's web

208
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,500
Fickle as we were

209
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:47,881
But gradually
without a word between us

210
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,008
Bit by bit

211
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:57,557
Feelings arose between
our bodies mingled in delight

212
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,146
Then words of love rose
to our naked lips

213
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,232
Bit by bit

214
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,655
Heaps of words of love
mingled gently with our kisses

215
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,074
So many words of love

216
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:22,290
I never thought
I'd always want you

217
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,459
Oh, my love

218
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:28,547
We never thought
we could live together

219
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,757
And not grow tired
of each other

220
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,719
To wake up every morning

221
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:39,015
Surprised to still be
so happy in the same bed

222
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:44,271
And want nothing more
than that ordinary pleasure

223
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,691
Of feeling so at ease
with each other

224
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:08,712
But gradually
without a word between us

225
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,839
Bit by bit

226
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:18,764
Our feelings bound us tight
in spite of ourselves, never to let go

227
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:25,020
Feelings stronger
than any words of love

228
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:27,105
Known or unknown

229
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,150
Feelings so wild and strong

230
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:34,571
That we never thought
were possible before

231
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:39,910
Don't ever promise
to adore me all your life

232
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,622
Let's never exchange
such promises

233
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,000
Knowing me
knowing you

234
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:53,131
Let's keep the feeling
that this love of ours

235
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:57,469
Is a love with no tomorrow

236
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:02,933
Well, in 60 years, when we're dead,
we'll know if we were always in love.

237
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,435
No, I know I love you,

238
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,814
but I'm not so sure about you.

239
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,316
I do, Marianne.

240
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,152
Well, we'll see.

241
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,573
Your wife was here this morning.

242
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,617
I don't give a damn.

243
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:21,952
That's not all.

244
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,788
I said I don't give a damn.

245
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,832
- Marianne tells
- Ferdinand

246
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:27,916
- a story
- all mixed up

247
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,877
- I knew some people
- like in the Algerian war

248
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,337
I'll explain everything

249
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,339
wake from a bad dream

250
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,517
- Frank had the keys?
- I'll explain everything.

251
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,020
- Were you in love with him?
- I'll explain everything.

252
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,647
- Did he kiss you?
- I'll explain everything.

253
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,243
- a story
- all mixed up

254
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,788
- leave in a hurry
- wake from a bad dream

255
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,831
- I knew some people
- politics

256
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,667
- an organization
- get away

257
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,627
gun-running

258
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,130
in silence... in silence

259
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,842
in silence

260
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,358
- It's me... Marianne.
- Did he kiss you?

261
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,068
- a story
- all mixed up

262
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,696
- I knew some people
- were you in love with him?

263
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,907
- use my apartment
- like in the Algerian war

264
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,575
- my brother
- wake from a bad dream

265
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:11,121
leave in a hurry... leave in a hurry

266
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,247
- answer
- clobber him

267
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:13,540
- argument
- garage

268
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:14,958
- who is it?
- down south

269
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:16,584
- get away
- no money

270
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,172
It was time to leave
that rotten world anyway.

271
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,217
We left Paris
on a one-way street.

272
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,177
Recognizing two of her own,

273
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,806
the Statue of Liberty
gave us a friendly wave.

274
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,815
- Put a tiger in my tank.
- We don't sell tigers.

275
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,985
Then just shut up
and fill 'er up, pal.

276
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,379
I'll look less suspicious.

277
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,018
That'll be 4,900 francs.

278
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,604
Check the water and oil, pal.

279
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,407
Help me, dope!

280
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,249
Shit! Another one!

281
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:43,004
I know a trick from Laurel and Hardy.
Get in the car.

282
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,424
- Shame on you! Don't you have money?
- No, sir.

283
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,219
Then get a job.
Or don't you want to work?

284
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,597
- No, sir, we don't.
- Then how will you pay?

285
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,145
Shit! There's one more left.
I'll handle him.

286
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,040
I'm calling the police!

287
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,462
- Sum total
- it was an adventure film

288
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,131
The Crown of Blood

289
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,882
- Sum total
- Tender is the Night

290
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,843
It was a love story.

291
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,636
It was a love story.

292
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,472
- Tender is the Night
- It was a love story.

293
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,643
We'll find my brother eventually.

294
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,820
Just what kind
of smuggling is he in?

295
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,489
Oh, some stuff in Africa.

296
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,492
Angola, the Congo.

297
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,829
I thought he did TV shows
in Monte Carlo.

298
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,831
Yeah, that too.

299
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:07,172
We've got to decide
where we're going.

300
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,677
We talked about Nice,
then maybe Italy.

301
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:18,183
Our money won't get us to Nice.
We'd better dump the Peugeot.

302
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,688
Have you ever
killed a man, Pierrot?

303
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:27,358
My name's Ferdinand.
Why do you ask?

304
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,530
Because it's going
to turn your stomach.

305
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,910
I wonder
what she told the cops.

306
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:42,332
Maybe they haven't questioned her yet.
- Don't kid yourself.

307
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,543
She told them
every nasty thing she could.

308
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,921
With good reason.

309
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:51,507
Anyway, I feel sorry for her.
- Sorry?

310
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:55,011
Guys like you are always sorry...

311
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,056
but always too late.

312
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,870
- What are you doing?
- Looking at myself.

313
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,747
What do you see?

314
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:26,751
A man about to drive
over a cliff at 60 mph.

315
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,381
I see a woman

316
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:35,802
in love with the man
about to drive over a cliff at 60 mph.

317
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:38,054
Then let's have a kiss.

318
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:50,108
The next day

319
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:51,651
RENDEZVOUS WITH DEATH

320
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:55,613
- we find the Peugeot
- entering a town in central France

321
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,907
- with its tank
- almost empty.

322
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,284
- Marianne
- and Ferdinand

323
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,036
- stop at a bar
- and order drinks

324
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,955
- wondering
- how to pay for them.

325
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:08,960
- Their descriptions are on the radio.
- People eye them warily.

326
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:13,298
- Their descrip... descrip...
- People eye them... eye them warily.

327
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,841
The people are:

328
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,302
Laszlo Kovacs, student,

329
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:22,473
born on January 25, 1936,

330
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,309
in Santo Domingo.

331
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,020
Forced to flee
the American invasion.

332
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:31,399
Now living in France
as a political refugee.

333
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:36,279
France... the land of liberty,
equality and brotherhood.

334
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:40,116
Viviane Blassel,
born on March 21, 1943, in Marseilles.

335
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:45,038
I'm 22. I work at the perfume counter
at a department store in Auxerre.

336
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:51,002
Eté, André, born on May 25, 1903,
in Marbouie, Eure-et-Loir.

337
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,795
Age: 62.

338
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:55,798
Present occupation: film extra.

339
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,010
Let's tell stories.
The right words may move them.

340
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,346
- About what?
- Anything at all.

341
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:06,017
The fall of Constantinople,
or Nicolas de StaëI committing suicide.

342
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,019
Or William Wilson,

343
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:11,856
who saw his double in the street
and couldn't rest till he'd killed him.

344
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:15,526
When it was done,
he realized he'd killed himself,

345
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,862
while his double went on living.

346
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,698
Okay. Maybe they'll give us
some money.

347
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:24,035
Marianne, who had the eyes
of both Aucassin and Nicolette,

348
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:27,872
told them about William of Orange's
nephew, the handsome Vivien,

349
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,501
who died fighting
30,000 Saracens.

350
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,461
Bleeding from
a thousand wounds,

351
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:36,631
he fought on alone,
for he swore not to retreat.

352
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,469
Oh, young and gentle nephew,
why this vow so noble yet so mad?

353
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:45,014
Ferdinand started
telling them about Guynemer,

354
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,974
but they weren't listening,

355
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,936
so he spoke of the summer,

356
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:53,981
and of how lovers long
for the warm evening air.

357
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:58,194
He spoke of man, and the seasons,
and unexpected encounters.

358
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:04,367
But he told them never to ask
which came first, words or things,

359
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:06,786
or what would come next.

360
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:10,123
I feel alive,
and that's all that matters.

361
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,565
I've got an idea.

362
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:41,028
We'll fake an accident.

363
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,919
The police will think we're dead.
Okay, Pierrot?

364
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,714
My name's Ferdinand.

365
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:04,427
All we have to do is burn the car.
They'll think we died in the fire.

366
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:09,640
- Always fire, blood and war!
- Hey, it wasn't my idea! Move it closer.

367
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,810
It's gotta look real.
This isn't a movie.

368
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,982
Closer! Hurry up!

369
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:27,992
- No matches. Let's go.
- That's okay. Give me the gun.

370
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:35,583
- The same make that killed Kennedy.
- Didn't you know that was me?

371
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,085
Out of the way.
- Wait a minute.

372
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,338
Nice little fire.

373
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,841
- Know what was in that suitcase?
- No. What?

374
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,886
The dollars you were looking for
in the apartment.

375
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,680
Bastard!
You did that on purpose.

376
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,182
That's right.

377
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,685
You know what we could've done
with that money?

378
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:59,398
We could've gone to Chicago,
Las Vegas, Monte Carlo. You bastard!

379
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,026
I'd have gone to Florence,
Venice and Athens.

380
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:04,654
Let's go.
Travel broadens the mind.

381
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,671
- Chapter Eight.
- A Season in Hell.

382
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,674
- Chapter Eight.
- We crossed France

383
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,551
- like shadows
- like a mirror

384
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,930
- like shadows
- like a mirror

385
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:21,809
I saw the café where Van Gogh
decided to cut off his ear.

386
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:25,396
- You're a liar. What did you see?
- I saw...

387
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,773
THE NICKEL-FOOTED GANG

388
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,237
Look, Pierrot, a Ford Galaxie.

389
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,907
My name's Ferdinand.
Yeah, a '62.

390
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,579
- Show me you're a man.
- Wait till I finish this.

391
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:45,958
"After covering a good distance,
they came to the Bayorda desert,

392
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,378
which they had to cross
to reach Karthoum.

393
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,423
'Darn! Not much shade!'
they grumbled,

394
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:55,259
as they set out
across the scorching sand.

395
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:59,388
'We'd be better off in the cool shade
of a glass of lager. "'

396
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:02,600
Make up your mind
or I'll hitch a ride alone.

397
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,436
All right.
Let's go, daddy-o.

398
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,334
A lube job, please.

399
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,337
Where are the bathrooms?

400
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,882
Come on, Mimi.

401
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,811
Hey, kid, how'd you like
to own a car like this?

402
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,438
- Sure!
- Well, you never will.

403
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:25,683
Marianne, his jacket.

404
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:32,356
Hey, kid, how'd you like
to earn 10,000 francs?

405
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,069
The landscape
rose slowly before us.

406
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:23,490
Countless centuries fled
into the distance, like so many storms.

407
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:36,128
Dump our clothes
while I turn around.

408
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,180
Hey, my book!

409
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,067
Hurry!

410
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:23,509
LIFE

411
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,138
- Well?
- Nothing special.

412
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,307
They questioned her.

413
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:34,478
She said she saw us
naked together in my bed.

414
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,314
You see?
And you called me a liar.

415
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,774
Nothing else?

416
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,986
You still seem
awfully interested in her.

417
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,196
Nothing at all happened.

418
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:47,574
I don't understand.
He's lost his mind.

419
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:52,287
Ditch a woman and she'll say
you've got a screw loose.

420
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,124
Men are the same way.

421
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,793
True.

422
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:02,297
I don't know why,
but I'm picking up the scent of death.

423
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,842
If you miss her, just say so!

424
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,136
Cut it out!
You're getting on my nerves!

425
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,930
I mean the scent of death
in the countryside, trees,

426
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,016
women's faces, cars.

427
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:17,312
We'll be in a hell of a fix without money.
We can't even get to Italy.

428
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,189
We'll just stop anywhere.

429
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:26,155
We'll just stop anywhere.

430
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,490
And do what all day?

431
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:32,536
No, let's find my brother.
He'll give us tons of dough.

432
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:38,500
Then we'll find ourselves
a high-class hotel and have some fun!

433
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,545
- All she thinks about is fun.
- Who are you talking to?

434
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,380
The audience.

435
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,926
I told you so.
You're already sorry.

436
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:51,388
You were crazy to do this.
- No, I'm in love.

437
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,390
It's the same thing.

438
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,895
I've decided never
to fall in love again.

439
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,230
It's a disgusting habit.

440
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,107
Don't say that.

441
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,450
Don't say that.

442
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:15,746
Ten minutes ago, I saw only death.
Now it's just the opposite. Look!

443
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,582
The sea, the waves, the sky.

444
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,795
Life may be sad,
but it's always beautiful.

445
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,923
Suddenly I feel free.
We can do what we want.

446
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:29,760
Watch:
right... left... left... right.

447
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,428
Look at the fool!

448
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,933
He's driving down a straight line
and has to follow it all the way.

449
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:38,018
Oh, yeah? Watch this.

450
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,240
Chapter Eight.

451
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,159
- A Season in Hell.
- Love must be reinvented.

452
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,620
Real life lies elsewhere.

453
00:40:57,122 --> 00:41:01,542
Countless centuries fled
into the distance, like so many storms.

454
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,962
I held her close
and began to cry.

455
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,421
It was our first,

456
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,799
our only dream.

457
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:27,568
You coming?

458
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,155
Where are we going?

459
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,241
To Mystery Island,
like Captain Grant's children.

460
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:37,244
- To do what?
- Nothing. Just exist.

461
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,706
- Doesn't sound like much fun.
- That's life.

462
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,293
Not at all.

463
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,672
It's a good thing
I don't like spinach,

464
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,008
because if I did, I'd eat it,

465
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,594
and I can't stand the stuff.

466
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,929
It's the same with you,

467
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,348
only just the opposite.

468
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:04,188
There was a film like that with
Michel Simon, where he fell for this girl -

469
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:08,734
- Well, you wanted to start life over.
- I wasn't being mean.

470
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:11,111
You said we'd see it
through to the end.

471
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,655
Yes, the end of the night.

472
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,218
Great view of the moon.

473
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,848
- Doesn't look too special to me.
- To me it does.

474
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,725
I see a man up there.

475
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:46,396
Maybe Leonov,
or that American... White.

476
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,607
Yeah, I see him too.

477
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:52,569
But he's not a Russki
or a nephew of Uncle Sam.

478
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,571
I'll tell you who he is.
- Who?

479
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,074
The moon's only inhabitant.

480
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:01,328
You know what he's doing?
Getting the hell out.

481
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:02,955
Why?

482
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,581
- Look.
- Why?

483
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:08,585
He's fed up.
He was glad to see Leonov land.

484
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:13,590
Someone to talk to
after an eternity alone!

485
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:17,761
But Leonov tried to stuff
his head full of Lenin.

486
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:21,807
So when the American landed,
the guy fled to his camp.

487
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:25,894
But the American right away
crammed a Coke down his throat

488
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:29,523
after making him say thank you first,
so now he's really had it.

489
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:33,360
He's letting the Americans and Russians
shoot it out. He's taking off.

490
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:35,988
- For where?
- Here.

491
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,448
Because he thinks you're lovely.

492
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,451
He admires you.

493
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:53,755
I think your legs and breasts
are very moving.

494
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,386
Fuck me.

495
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,738
Chapter Seven.

496
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:21,491
- A poet named after a gun
- Robert Browning

497
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,951
- get away
- never

498
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,329
- beloved
- as long as I'm me

499
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,830
and you're you

500
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:30,125
as long as the universe
will hold us both

501
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:33,170
- I who love you
- and you who reject me

502
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:37,007
- as long as one wants to flee
- it's too much like fate

503
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:00,697
"I've decided to keep a journal...
the urgency to describe in words... "

504
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,212
"Eyes: human landscapes.

505
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,756
Mouth: onomatopoeia.

506
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,259
The language of poetry
rises from the ruins. "

507
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,516
"The writer chooses to...
the freedom of others. "

508
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:17,357
- Did you get all the books?
- No, but this was on sale.

509
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,192
By someone with your name.

510
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,112
- Ah, Ferdinand.
- You've heard of him?

511
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:26,992
"I am fire, I am light,
I am a miracle.

512
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,286
I no longer hear.

513
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:31,329
I ascend.

514
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,749
I pass through the air. "

515
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,751
It's too much.

516
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:41,798
"I've seen happiness before me.

517
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:44,468
Supernatural emotion!

518
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,891
And then...

519
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:55,228
I no longer know anything.

520
00:46:56,522 --> 00:47:00,317
I inch my hands forward...

521
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,864
and I dare... to the right...

522
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,284
I lightly stroke...

523
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,411
my fairy's hair...

524
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,747
that wonder whom I adore...

525
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:15,499
Virginia. "

526
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:20,003
Guignol's Band.
Well, are you coming?

527
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:22,172
"Perfect happiness!

528
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:27,677
Ah, my ecstasy was so intense

529
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,222
that I dared not move.

530
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:33,767
Happy to the point of tears,
numb with happiness,

I'm all aquiver.

532

Let my heart swell and burn within me.
I myself am flame.

533
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:51,743
I am in space.
I cling to Virginia. "

534
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:53,787
Give me that.

535
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:02,712
"You promised me
China and Tibet, Mr. Sosthène.

00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:07,175
The Sunda Islands, and wonderful
plants with magical powers. "

537
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,886
Where is all that now?

538
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:16,059
Cham cham cham ratatam.
I caught him in his lies.

539
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,398
- What's today?
- Friday.

540
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:23,441
You'll never leave me?

541
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,151
Of course I won't.

542
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,611
Of course?

543
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:30,615
Yes, of course.

544
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:41,585
Yes, of course.

"Thursday: Poetry is a game
of loser-take-all. "

546
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,974
What am I to do?

547
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,935
I don't know what to do.

548
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,980
What am I to do?

549
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,941
I don't know what to do.

550
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:12,282
Quiet! I'm writing!

551
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:17,120
"There's the crux of the matter.

552
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,456
You're waiting for me.
I'm not there.

553
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:22,125
I arrive.
I come into the room.

554
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:25,795
I only really exist for you
from that moment on.

555
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,923
But I existed before that.
I had thoughts.

556
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,301
Perhaps I even suffered.

557
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:36,181
So the task is
to show you alive, thinking of me,

558
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:40,185
and to see me at the same time,
alive for that very reason. "

559
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:42,270
I'm underlining that.

560
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:51,821
Still thinking about your brother
and that gun business?

561
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:57,952
Why do you look so sad?

562
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,498
Because you speak
to me in words,

563
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,501
and I look at you with feelings.

564
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:08,088
I can't have
a real conversation with you.

565
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:12,050
You never have ideas,
only feelings.

566
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:15,720
That's not true.
There are ideas inside feelings.

567
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:19,891
Okay. Let's try to have
a serious conversation.

568
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,977
You tell me what you like,
what you want,

569
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,021
and I'll do the same.

570
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,357
Go on. You start.

571
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,192
Flowers...

572
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:31,444
animals...

573
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:36,324
the blue of the sky...

574
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,618
music.

575
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:43,373
I don't know - everything.
What about you?

576
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:47,419
Ambition...

577
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:50,422
hope...

578
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,758
the way things move...

579
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,802
accidents.

580
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,888
What else?
Well, everything.

581
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:09,733
See?
I was right five years ago.

582
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:14,028
We never understand each other.

583
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,616
What am I to do?

584
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,827
I don't know what to do.

585
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,056
"Sunday.
She opened the... and then...

586
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:45,685
Monday.
... I read a lot. "

587
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,233
DEATH

588
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:54,110
How are you, old man?

589
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:55,945
All right.

590
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,324
I've got an idea for a novel:

591
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:03,203
not to write
about people's lives anymore,

592
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:08,583
but only about life - life itself.

593
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,419
What lies in between people:

594
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:16,883
space, sound, and color.

595
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,428
I'd like to accomplish that.

596
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:24,432
Joyce gave it a try,

597
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:29,437
but it should be possible
to do better.

598
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:31,272
Here are your books.

599
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:35,109
These aren't the ones.

600
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:37,612
And there's one missing.
I said five.

601
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:41,449
I bought a little 45 rpm.
Look.

602
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:45,787
I said one record for every 50 books.
Music after literature!

603
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:49,165
If you don't like it,
my friend -

604
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:59,676
Little mouse,
it's on the house!

605
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:01,970
What's eating you?

606
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:05,431
I can make up
stupid rhymes too.

607
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:07,517
What's the matter?

608
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:09,394
I'm fed up!

609
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:12,981
I'm sick of the sea,
the sun, the sand!

610
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,983
Sick of eating
out of tin cans!

611
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,819
Sick of always wearing
the same dress!

612
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:19,737
I want outta here.

613
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,324
I want to live.

614
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,743
What am I supposed to do?

615
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,497
I don't know.
I want to go away.

616
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:32,792
Anyway, I threw away
our money for the winter.

617
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:34,002
Where?

618
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,337
In the sea, idiot!

619
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:44,304
You're crazy, Marianne.

620
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:48,892
If you want to get out of here,
we'll need money.

621
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,690
Lots of tourists
come over on the boat.

622
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:58,026
We can steal from them.

623
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,694
Come on, Pierrot.

624
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:01,863
My name's Ferdinand.

625
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:06,492
Come on. We've played
Jules Verne long enough.

626
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:09,871
Let's go back
to our detective novel,

627
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,708
with fast cars and guns
and nightclubs.

628
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,627
Come on!

629
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,922
Wait for me, Marianne!

630
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:23,760
Does this brother of yours
really exist?

631
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:27,055
It's funny how
you never believe me.

632
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,358
Listen...

633
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:43,947
if we find Fred and he gives us dough,
why don't we go to Miami Beach?

634
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,118
Deep down you're a coward.

635
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:52,956
"Courage consists in remaining
inside oneself, close to nature,

636
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,208
which is oblivious
to our crises. "

637
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:58,586
Will you hurry up?
The tourist boat's gonna leave.

638
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:00,630
Wait. I've got an idea.

639
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:03,007
Give me your lipstick.

640
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:13,810
"In the end...

641
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:19,482
the only thing of any interest

642
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:23,778
is the paths people take.

643
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:28,116
The tragic part is that
even when they know

644
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:32,453
where they're going
and who they are,

645
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,081
everything is still a mystery. "

646
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:37,458
Like the scent of eucalyptus.

647
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:40,003
- That's right.
- You bet it is.

648
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:46,050
"And that mystery,
forever unsolved, is life. "

649
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:49,554
- Get a move on, Paul.
- Shut up, Virginia.

650
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:03,067
"We are dead men on parole.
And the trees?"

651
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,303
"To earn a little money,

652
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:35,058
we drew for the tourists -
modern-day slaves. "

653
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:48,863
Damn! Americans!

654
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:51,866
It's okay.
We'll change our plan.

655
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:55,870
- It's simple.
- What?

656
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:59,290
We'll put on a play.
Maybe they'll give us some dollars.

657
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:02,752
- What play?
- I don't know. Something they'll like.

658
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:05,880
I've got it.
The Vietnam War.

659
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:05,773
"Uncle Sam's nephew
versus Uncle Ho's niece. "

660
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:44,478
A little something for the actors.

661
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:48,816
- A dollar!
- Don't worry, Pierrot.

662
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,115
Long live Kennedy!

663
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:05,750
I threw them off our trail.
Let's go back.

664
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:08,085
No, I'm going dancing.

665
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,048
Come on.
You can go tomorrow.

666
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:15,676
Next chapter: Despair.

667
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:18,179
- I'm staying here.
- Okay. I'll go alone.

668
00:59:18,347 --> 00:59:19,347
Hope.

669
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,598
You do that.

670
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:22,016
Remembrance of Things Past.

671
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:25,811
I heard there's a dance hall
across the water.

672
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,855
I'm going dancing.

673
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:30,858
If we get killed, too bad.

674
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:34,570
They'll catch up with us.
So what?

675
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:38,241
Tuesday I wanted
to buy a record player,

676
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:42,078
but he spends
all our money on books.

677
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:44,497
Oh, I don't really give a damn.

678
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:47,708
But he can't even
understand that.

679
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,712
I don't give a damn
about books

680
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,466
or records or anything -
even money.

681
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,718
I just want to live.

682
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:01,222
But he'll never understand that.

683
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,058
To live.

684
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,911
My fate line is short as can be

685
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:29,417
My fate line is short as can be

686
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:33,921
My palm is such an ill-fated thing

687
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:38,342
I'm afraid of what tomorrow may bring

688
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:43,055
My fate line, my fate line

689
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:46,934
Darling, what do you think
of my fate line

690
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:50,604
What does it matter
It's fine, just fine

691
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:55,151
Your thigh line
is more in my line

692
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,446
My fate line

693
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:01,449
I love to hold it in my lap

694
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,617
Your thigh line

695
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:05,953
My fate line

696
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:09,332
It's a feather in my cap

697
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:28,559
Just look at my little fate line

698
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:32,980
Just look at my little fate line

699
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:37,276
Just look at destiny's call

700
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:41,655
So small it's hardly there at all

701
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:45,868
My fate line, my fate line

702
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,747
Darling, what do you think
of my fate line

703
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:53,626
What does it matter
It's fine, just fine

704
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:57,254
Give me your hand
and don't say a word

705
01:01:57,672 --> 01:02:00,841
Your thigh line
- My fate line

706
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:03,761
It's like a morning bird

707
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:08,099
Your thigh line
- My fate line

708
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:11,685
Frivolous bird, harbinger of fate

709
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:36,252
Such a tiny little fate line

710
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:40,631
Such a tiny little fate line

711
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:44,468
Almost less than nothing

712
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:49,515
Barely a tiny dot in my hand

713
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:54,145
My fate line, my fate line

714
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:57,940
Darling, what do you think
of my fate line

715
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:01,777
What does it matter
It's fine, just fine

716
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:05,656
Every morning
I'm the happiest man

717
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,993
Your thigh line
- My fate line

718
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:12,413
A bird is singing in my hand

719
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:16,000
Your thigh-
- line

720
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:18,627
- My fate-
- line

721
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:25,426
Maybe I'm daydreaming.

722
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:30,723
She makes me think of music.

723
01:03:31,183 --> 01:03:32,892
Her face.

724
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:36,103
We have come

725
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:40,274
to the age
of man and his double.

726
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:45,321
We no longer need mirrors
to talk to ourselves.

727
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:55,122
When Marianne says,
"It's a fine day,"

728
01:03:55,624 --> 01:03:57,791
what's she thinking about?

729
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:02,171
All I have is that image of her

730
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:05,257
saying, "It's a fine day. "

731
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:07,134
Nothing else.

732
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:15,017
What good is it
figuring all this out?

733
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,230
We are made of dreams,

734
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:23,150
and dreams are made of us.

735
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,488
It's a fine day, my love,

736
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:32,034
in dreams, in words and in death.

737
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:35,955
It's a fine day, my love.
It's a fine day

738
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,873
in life.

739
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:25,713
- You know what I'm thinking?
- I couldn't care less.

740
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:29,550
Let's not start that again.

741
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:32,511
I said to leave me alone.

742
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:37,683
Besides, I'm not starting again.
I'm continuing.

743
01:05:44,733 --> 01:05:47,067
- Shit!
- What?

744
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,415
Shit! Shit! Shit!

745
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:03,459
What's the matter?

746
01:06:06,755 --> 01:06:09,465
Know what you should
write a novel about?

747
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,425
No. What?

748
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:17,139
This guy's strolling around Paris
when suddenly he sees Death.

749
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:20,351
So he promptly heads south
to get away,

750
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:23,020
because he figures
his time hasn't come yet.

751
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:24,355
And then?

752
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:27,232
He drives all night at top speed,

753
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,486
and the next morning,
when he reaches the coast,

754
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:34,365
he crashes into a truck
and dies,

755
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:38,035
just when he thought
Death had lost his trail.

756
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:59,640
- Let's hurry.
- We've got plenty of time.

757
01:06:59,808 --> 01:07:01,684
No, I'm afraid.

758
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:18,659
You stay here.

759
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:25,332
- So we meet again.
- What do you want?

760
01:07:28,253 --> 01:07:31,505
- I'll be back in five minutes.
- I'll beat him up if you want.

761
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:34,842
No, I'll get rid of him
with a few lies.

762
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:37,511
I have to find Fred, Pierrot.

763
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:40,514
My name's Ferdinand.
Okay, okay.

764
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:02,244
"... eroticism, in that sense, betrays...
nostalgia for continuity... "

765
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:13,213
- Two beers.
- Two?

766
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:18,469
So when I finish one,
I'll still have one left.

767
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,149
Remember me?

768
01:08:33,568 --> 01:08:36,904
You stayed at my place
in Fontainebleau last year.

769
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,032
I lent you 100,000 francs.

770
01:08:42,494 --> 01:08:45,704
You slept with my wife.
- Oh, right.

771
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:48,791
- So you've come south?
- Yes, to the coast here.

772
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,001
- Everything okay?
- Fine.

773
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,929
Mr. Griffon?

774
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,106
My name's Ferdinand.
Yes, it's me.

775
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:15,025
I'm scared.

776
01:09:16,444 --> 01:09:18,487
They're out of their minds.

777
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,448
I swear this isn't a joke.

778
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:58,151
Tell me where
the money is or else.

779
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,992
We'll give you electric shocks,

780
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:07,995
like they did during the war.

781
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:13,166
Or else...

782
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:16,503
like in Vietnam...

783
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:20,549
we'll strip you...

784
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:26,388
put you in a bathtub
full of napalm...

785
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:34,855
and set it on fire.

786
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:39,902
No, right now.

787
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:42,738
You can caress me all over.
I'll be nice again.

788
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:46,700
Then come quick.

789
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,272
We'll walk up.

790
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:39,896
A glorious death for a little man.

791
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:12,929
What are you doing here?

792
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:15,974
I heard a noise.
I live downstairs.

793
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:20,187
Let him have it.

794
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,374
We'll use that trick of yours.

795
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:47,380
You can't fight us, kid.

796
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:52,469
What'd you do with the money
in the Peugeot?

797
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:58,725
Take him in the bathroom
and use that trick you learned.

798
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:10,821
We can't forget about the yacht.

799
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:12,739
There aren't any towels.

800
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:15,617
Use that little whore's dress.

801
01:14:19,539 --> 01:14:23,667
Just cover his head
so the water will cut off the air.

802
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:27,796
I'll make this easy
and tell you what I know.

803
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:31,758
Then I want a straight answer
to one question.

804
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:35,595
I know your name
is Ferdinand Griffon.

805
01:14:35,847 --> 01:14:39,141
You were with Marianne
when she stabbed our friend Donovan,

806
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:41,852
and you ran off with my $50,000.

807
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:43,937
Ploom ploom tra-la-la.

808
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:46,940
I've got nothing
against you personally.

809
01:14:47,108 --> 01:14:51,403
I'm sure she dragged you into this.
That's your business.

810
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:56,366
As I was saying...

811
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:02,831
I'm not interested in you.
It's her I want.

812
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:06,334
Now, tell me where to find her
and the money.

813
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:10,672
This is your last chance.
Tell me or we kill you.

814
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,799
Ploom ploom tra-la-la.

815
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:33,987
The Marquise dance hall.

816
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:36,406
Maybe it's true, maybe not,

817
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:39,367
but this chump's
not gonna say any more.

818
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,369
We'll go have a look.

819
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:46,374
The Marquise dance hall.

820
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:49,294
We'll go have a look.

821
01:15:55,509 --> 01:16:00,388
"I've never understood...
Marianne's loyalty. "

822
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:03,516
What a dreadful
5:00 in the afternoon.

823
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:16,321
I don't want to see blood.

824
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:20,784
What a dreadful
5:00 in the afternoon.

825
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:25,080
I don't want to see blood.

826
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:30,710
I don't want to see blood.

827
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:33,964
What a dreadful
5:00 in the afternoon.

828
01:17:37,445 --> 01:17:40,780
- Next we find Ferdinand arriving in...
- Toulon.

829
01:17:40,948 --> 01:17:44,075
He wanders along the waterfront.
He's staying...

830
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:45,785
at the Little Palace Hotel.

831
01:17:46,037 --> 01:17:47,537
- He looks for
- Marianne

832
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:50,957
but he doesn't find her.
The days go by.

833
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:54,961
Some afternoons,
he sleeps in all-day movies.

834
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:57,213
He still keeps a diary.

835
01:17:57,465 --> 01:18:00,633
For words have the power
to disperse the shadows

836
01:18:00,968 --> 01:18:03,261
from around the objects they name.

837
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:05,513
Even if it's compromised
in everyday life,

838
01:18:05,765 --> 01:18:07,974
language often retains
only what is pure.

839
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:13,021
"sea"

840
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:16,608
"soul"

841
01:18:17,902 --> 01:18:19,778
"bitter"

842
01:18:20,363 --> 01:18:22,113
"weapon"

843
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:27,494
In Vietnam, the Da Nang base,
a major US stronghold,

844
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,454
was attacked by the Viet Cong.

845
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,457
Seven planes were destroyed
on the ground.

846
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:34,000
In the jungle,

847
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:37,337
US soldiers fought side by side
for the first time

848
01:18:37,505 --> 01:18:39,506
with South Vietnamese
and Australian forces

849
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:42,258
against Viet Cong guerilla units.

850
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:54,020
Despite this escalation, and the failure
of the Commonwealth peace mission,

851
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:58,525
Harold Wilson stands ready
to participate in negotiations.

852
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:11,788
Your story ends there.

853
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:14,707
Yes, he turned away...

854
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:19,212
leaving me bewildered.

855
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:25,552
We were looking carefully

856
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:30,056
for the moment when we had
abandoned the fictional character

857
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:34,102
to return to the real one,
if it ever existed.

858
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:43,611
I am Princess Aïcha Abadie,

859
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:47,824
and despite my fragile,
doll-like appearance,

860
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:50,827
I am a very
strong-minded woman.

861
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:54,581
I don't like people getting in my way.
I want to be obeyed.

862
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:55,748
Your orders, Princess?

863
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:58,126
I am Lebanese by adoption.

864
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:03,006
In 1960 I married Emir Abadie,

865
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:05,800
and I am queen of Lebanon in exile,

866
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:10,680
for, as you know, my country
is currently a socialist republic.

867
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:13,433
I am therefore
in Nice incognito,

868
01:20:13,684 --> 01:20:17,020
as my husband and I
have terrible enemies.

869
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:20,648
There's a price
on our heads in Lebanon.

870
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:24,903
I'm often the target
of machine-gun fire,

871
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:28,907
which always misses me,
no doubt due to Allah's protection,

872
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:33,620
because to marry the emir,
I had to convert to Islam.

873
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:39,459
I've flown to Beirut twice
in my husband's space machine,

874
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:43,129
and the marabout of Atla -

875
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:45,298
Alexis, don't let me go flying off.

876
01:20:45,466 --> 01:20:49,135
The sea is choppy,
and you know how light I am.

877
01:20:57,478 --> 01:20:59,979
Help me, Ferdinand.

878
01:21:10,157 --> 01:21:12,742
Ferdinand,
we weigh anchor in an hour.

879
01:21:12,910 --> 01:21:14,035
Yes, Princess.

880
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:16,788
Alexis, we're going into town.

881
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:23,002
Pierrot!

882
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:41,688
It's me.

883
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:44,107
My name's Ferdinand.

884
01:21:44,275 --> 01:21:45,692
Hi.

885
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:48,778
You don't seem
too surprised to see me.

886
01:21:49,405 --> 01:21:51,197
What are you doing here?

887
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:55,618
I'm so happy.
I've found you at last.

888
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,999
- Where are you staying?
- With you, you idiot!

889
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:05,461
I'm staying with you.
I've looked all over for you.

890
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:12,927
You should have waited
after you called me.

891
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:15,054
I wanted to.

892
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:18,349
I got away
before those men arrived.

893
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:22,395
I ran to the dance hall
to warn you not to come,

894
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:24,814
but I didn't see you,

895
01:22:24,982 --> 01:22:30,695
so I went back, and I saw
those men getting into the blue Ford.

896
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:33,615
I thought they'd killed you.

897
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:38,578
So I took off.
I didn't care where.

898
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:43,583
I don't even remember where.
I was afraid to come back to the coast.

899
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:50,048
Then one day I ran into Fred
in a bar in Toulon.

900
01:22:50,257 --> 01:22:53,718
It's true.
The Las Vegas bar, in Toulon.

901
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:57,597
- How'd you know I was working here?
- That was by chance too.

902
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:00,683
It's true.

903
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,812
I believe you, liar.

904
01:23:05,064 --> 01:23:07,774
Why don't you ever believe
that I love you?

905
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:10,193
I love you in my own way.

906
01:23:10,444 --> 01:23:12,111
That's just it.

907
01:23:12,613 --> 01:23:15,114
I'll prove it. Look.

908
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:18,785
I went back to our beach
and got your notebook.

909
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:20,286
Thanks.

910
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:22,789
Look on the last page.

911
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:27,502
There's a little poem
I wrote about you.

912
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:31,130
"Tender and cruel...

913
01:23:31,382 --> 01:23:34,801
real and surreal...

914
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:38,012
terrifying and funny...

915
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:41,224
nocturnal and diurnal...

916
01:23:41,392 --> 01:23:44,560
usual and unusual...

917
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,438
handsome as anything.
- Crazy Pierrot!"

918
01:23:47,606 --> 01:23:50,775
I told you my name's Ferdinand,
goddamn it!

919
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:54,654
If you think you're tough
saying "goddamn it," you're wrong.

920
01:23:54,822 --> 01:23:56,864
God can go to -

921
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,783
Don't talk like that.

922
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:00,410
You should talk.

923
01:24:00,577 --> 01:24:03,621
We're wanted for murder.
You know what murder is?

924
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:07,250
Sure. What about it?
Does it scare you?

925
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:10,670
Answer me.

926
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:14,757
I look at you and listen to you,
but that's not what counts.

927
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:16,300
Thanks a lot.

928
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:20,430
No, I mean this very moment -
which is already past.

929
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:26,185
Oh, I don't know. It's the blue
of the sky, our relationship.

930
01:24:26,437 --> 01:24:28,146
I don't get it.

931
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:31,858
I wish time would stand still.

932
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:35,278
Look. I'm putting my hand
on your knee.

933
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:40,199
That's a wonderful thing in itself.
That's life.

934
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:43,703
Space, feelings.

935
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:49,500
But instead I'm following you
back to our tale of sound and fury.

936
01:24:49,793 --> 01:24:53,087
But I don't care.
- Are you coming? Fred's waiting.

937
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:56,591
Forget I said anything.
Let's go, daddy-o.

938
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:02,930
I wonder what's keeping the cops.
We should be in jail by now.

939
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:07,226
They're smart.
They let people destroy themselves.

940
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:37,799
Why do you do things like that?

941
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:41,552
I tell you I didn't kill him.

942
01:25:57,653 --> 01:26:00,905
It's funny we're still alive
after that parade of corpses.

943
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:04,283
- Yeah - ho ho ho.
- Looks like Pépé le Moko around here.

944
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:05,910
Who?

945
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,871
- Pépé le Moko.
- Who's that?

946
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:11,457
You sure don't know much.

947
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:19,715
What about you?
You know what you are?

948
01:26:19,967 --> 01:26:22,260
I'm a man with sexual desires.

949
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:24,428
Says you!

950
01:26:25,097 --> 01:26:29,141
I know who you are,
but you don't.

951
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:30,601
It's true.

952
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:35,523
I'm just a huge question mark
hanging over the Mediterranean horizon.

953
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:50,496
"... their truth...
independent of us... our logic... "

954
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,791
Are your parents still alive?

955
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:57,336
Yes. They've never been apart.

956
01:26:57,671 --> 01:27:00,172
They were almost
separated once.

957
01:27:01,008 --> 01:27:04,051
Papa was leaving on a trip.
I can't remember where.

958
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:06,304
Some short trip.

959
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:10,266
They didn't have
money for two tickets.

960
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:13,477
Mama went with him
to the bus stop,

961
01:27:14,021 --> 01:27:16,022
and they looked at each other,

962
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:19,567
Mama from the sidewalk,
Papa from the window.

963
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:24,697
Just as the bus started up,
Papa dashed to get off.

964
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:27,074
He didn't want to leave Mama.

965
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:32,455
While he got off in front,
she was getting on in back,

966
01:27:32,623 --> 01:27:34,957
because she didn't want
to leave his side.

967
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:37,543
In the end, he didn't go.

968
01:27:37,711 --> 01:27:40,546
What did you do
when you worked in an elevator?

969
01:27:40,714 --> 01:27:44,467
Nothing.
I looked at people's faces.

970
01:27:44,635 --> 01:27:47,595
- Where was that?
- The Galeries Lafayette.

971
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:51,223
Why all these questions?

972
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:53,601
I want to know
exactly who you are.

973
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:56,646
I never knew,
not even five years ago.

974
01:27:56,813 --> 01:28:00,524
I'm just a sentimental girl,
that's all.

975
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:04,028
Only a fool would make
a big mystery out of that.

976
01:28:04,196 --> 01:28:06,614
What's your brother do?

977
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:09,867
I never know
when you're making things up.

978
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:12,370
Oh, you know -

979
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:14,538
What was he doing
in Tel Aviv?

980
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:20,544
Listen: There's a war
going on in Yemen.

981
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:23,130
You're really out of touch.

982
01:28:23,757 --> 01:28:27,009
He gets money
from the Royalists.

983
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:30,221
Are those other men
with the Arab League?

984
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:32,264
I don't know. Probably.

985
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:34,600
Is there really
a troupe of dancers?

986
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:37,103
What do you care?

987
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:39,271
Why does he need a cover?

988
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:42,441
Gun-running's practically
official business these days.

989
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:45,361
- What do you care?
- Answer me.

990
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:47,947
I'll tell you something.

991
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:53,202
There are 3,600 seconds
in an hour.

992
01:28:54,121 --> 01:28:58,290
That makes
about 100,000 seconds in a day.

993
01:28:59,209 --> 01:29:02,461
In an average lifetime,
that makes...

994
01:29:03,922 --> 01:29:07,508
250 billion seconds.

995
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:13,848
All in all, you and I have spent
about one month together.

996
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:20,187
Add it up. I've only been
with you a few million seconds

997
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,983
out of the 250 billion
that make up your life.

998
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:26,360
It's not much.

999
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,612
So I'm not surprised

1000
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:31,490
we don't know
who each other is.

1001
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:49,925
...5, 6, 7, 8.

1002
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:52,178
You made it!

1003
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:57,099
Will he do it?
- Yeah, anything I say.

1004
01:29:57,893 --> 01:30:00,019
What a crazy set-up

1005
01:30:01,188 --> 01:30:03,355
...6, 7, 8!

1006
01:30:08,195 --> 01:30:11,030
"to see clearly... reason... life. "

1007
01:30:32,052 --> 01:30:33,761
What am I supposed to do?

1008
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:36,305
Just do as you're told.

1009
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:39,934
Keep your eyes and ears open
and you'll see.

1010
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:43,562
Remember
the scent of eucalyptus?

1011
01:30:44,689 --> 01:30:47,733
- With you it's always so complicated.
- No, it's simple.

1012
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:49,235
Too much going on.

1013
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:52,738
There's a little harbor,
like in a Conrad novel.

1014
01:30:52,906 --> 01:30:55,825
A sailboat,
like in Robert Louis Stevenson.

1015
01:30:56,076 --> 01:30:58,577
An old brothel, like in Faulkner.

1016
01:30:58,829 --> 01:31:00,955
A steward turned multimillionaire,

1017
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:03,165
like in Jack London.

1018
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:06,377
- With you it's always so complicated.
- No, it's simple.

1019
01:31:06,545 --> 01:31:08,587
Too much going on.

1020
01:31:08,755 --> 01:31:12,967
Two guys beat me up,
like in Raymond Chandler.

1021
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:16,512
You and me and him -
see how simple it is?

1022
01:31:16,763 --> 01:31:17,888
No, I don't see.

1023
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:19,348
- They want to
- buy the yacht.

1024
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:20,724
- The old man
- isn't French.

1025
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:22,601
- My brother
- collects the money.

1026
01:31:22,853 --> 01:31:24,311
- The others
- don't know.

1027
01:31:24,604 --> 01:31:25,729
- They'll be
- furious.

1028
01:31:25,939 --> 01:31:28,315
They'll tail Fred.
We'll get rid of them.

1029
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:30,609
- And then?
- Just do as you're told.

1030
01:32:02,142 --> 01:32:04,226
A woman can kill
lots of people easy.

1031
01:32:04,394 --> 01:32:07,313
Full breasts and soft thighs
don't mean

1032
01:32:07,606 --> 01:32:12,318
she can't kill everyone
to remain free or protect herself.

1033
01:32:12,485 --> 01:32:16,530
Just look at Cuba
or Vietnam or Israel.

1034
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:34,006
- I love you!
- Me too!

1035
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:46,453
Next chapter: Despair.

1036
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:47,997
Next chapter:

1037
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:51,208
Freedom... Bitterness.

1038
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:13,480
Seen a young woman around

1039
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:15,816
like a Hollywood
movie star in Technicolor?

1040
01:34:16,359 --> 01:34:18,193
None of your business.

1041
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:24,366
You got it?

1042
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:27,995
We all meet tonight as planned?

1043
01:34:32,876 --> 01:34:34,793
Some people saw me.

1044
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:37,212
I don't understand.

1045
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:39,506
Fred will look innocent now.

1046
01:34:39,758 --> 01:34:41,842
Why are you double-crossing me?

1047
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:46,805
What's the matter?

1048
01:34:47,057 --> 01:34:51,018
Nothing. Just looking
at a woman who's tormenting me.

1049
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:54,646
$50,000 would make
anyone nervous, Pierrot.

1050
01:34:54,814 --> 01:34:56,440
My name's Ferdinand.

1051
01:34:56,900 --> 01:35:00,861
Why did you kiss me earlier?
- I felt like it.

1052
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:07,117
- Kiss me again.
- Not in front of everyone.

1053
01:35:09,162 --> 01:35:11,663
Why do you wear
such tight pants?

1054
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:16,377
Listen. If you don't like it,
go back to Paris.

1055
01:35:17,087 --> 01:35:18,712
Kiss me.

1056
01:35:19,089 --> 01:35:20,839
Okay, I get it.

1057
01:35:21,466 --> 01:35:24,134
You know, it's bad luck
to double-cross us.

1058
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:26,136
Speak Not, Cassandra.

1059
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:28,722
- What?
- It's the title of this novel.

1060
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:30,349
Stupid jerk.

1061
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:35,187
Hey!

1062
01:35:35,355 --> 01:35:37,356
Marianne!
- What?

1063
01:35:37,524 --> 01:35:42,820
TWA, Nice airport, the 2:45 to Tahiti.
We just climb aboard.

1064
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:45,531
Just the two of us, obviously.

1065
01:35:45,698 --> 01:35:47,616
Obviously.

1066
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:55,958
Obviously.

1067
01:35:56,626 --> 01:35:58,377
French is funny.

1068
01:35:58,545 --> 01:36:01,547
Words say the opposite
of what they mean.

1069
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:05,384
We say "obviously"
when things aren't obvious at all.

1070
01:36:05,552 --> 01:36:09,096
Like it wasn't obvious
that I'd find the old man

1071
01:36:09,389 --> 01:36:12,349
with a bullet-hole in his forehead.

1072
01:36:12,892 --> 01:36:14,935
Did you know
your brother would kill him?

1073
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:16,895
It was none of my business.

1074
01:36:17,063 --> 01:36:19,273
I'd like to run off with you,

1075
01:36:19,566 --> 01:36:22,484
but Fred will find us
and get even.

1076
01:36:22,735 --> 01:36:25,612
I saw him get even
with a girl once.

1077
01:36:25,864 --> 01:36:27,948
I'll protect you.

1078
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:33,579
Okay. But I have to go alone
or they'll suspect.

1079
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:35,080
Okay, my beautiful.

1080
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:36,915
Okay, my handsome.

1081
01:36:40,211 --> 01:36:44,840
Well, I'm off, since we have
nothing more to say.

1082
01:36:45,008 --> 01:36:47,176
Meet me in half an hour.

1083
01:36:49,012 --> 01:36:50,721
I'll count to...

1084
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:53,432
137.

1085
01:36:55,101 --> 01:36:56,935
You're really crazy.

1086
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:04,610
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

1087
01:37:07,113 --> 01:37:08,614
The briefcase!

1088
01:37:08,907 --> 01:37:11,575
Start the car.
Trust me and I'll trust you.

1089
01:37:11,743 --> 01:37:13,952
...18, 19, 20, 21, 22...

1090
01:39:27,629 --> 01:39:29,254
Something wrong, pal?

1091
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:32,215
It's that tune.

1092
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:34,718
You have no idea
what it means to me.

1093
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:36,386
You hear it?

1094
01:39:36,638 --> 01:39:38,930
No, I don't hear anything.

1095
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:42,017
You wouldn't understand.

1096
01:39:42,268 --> 01:39:45,270
That tune's my whole life.

1097
01:39:45,772 --> 01:39:48,982
When I hear it, it just -

1098
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:53,445
One day I was home.
It was playing on the radio.

1099
01:39:57,450 --> 01:40:03,163
She sat beside me,
this magnificent, beautiful woman.

1100
01:40:05,249 --> 01:40:07,250
I took her hand

1101
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:11,421
and stroked the back of it,
like this.

1102
01:40:12,173 --> 01:40:16,426
I asked her...
Do you love me

1103
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:22,432
She said no.

1104
01:40:22,975 --> 01:40:26,770
So I bought the record,
because that music just -

1105
01:40:29,399 --> 01:40:32,275
Like my own private case
of mass hysteria.

1106
01:40:32,652 --> 01:40:36,905
One day at home,
I put on the record.

1107
01:40:38,658 --> 01:40:40,951
It went around and around

1108
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:43,995
in my head!
Everything was spinning!

1109
01:40:44,956 --> 01:40:48,250
She was beside me -
a different woman.

1110
01:40:48,501 --> 01:40:51,211
Not as pretty as the first...

1111
01:40:53,464 --> 01:40:57,801
but anyway,
I took her hand

1112
01:40:58,177 --> 01:41:03,640
and stroked it on the other side
this time, just for a change.

1113
01:41:04,434 --> 01:41:08,770
I asked...
Do you love me

1114
01:41:11,149 --> 01:41:13,650
And she said, "Oh, I do!"

1115
01:41:16,696 --> 01:41:20,866
But I didn't love her,
so I broke the record!

1116
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:29,040
One day I turned on the radio,
and it was playing.

1117
01:41:29,208 --> 01:41:31,585
Why that song?
Why not something else?

1118
01:41:32,044 --> 01:41:36,381
She was beside me - no, other side,
'cause we were at her place.

1119
01:41:36,549 --> 01:41:38,717
This was a third woman.

1120
01:41:39,552 --> 01:41:44,514
I took her hand and stroked it -
on both sides, just to be done with it.

1121
01:41:44,682 --> 01:41:47,893
It was getting on my nerves.

1122
01:41:48,102 --> 01:41:51,605
I asked...
Do you love me

1123
01:41:53,149 --> 01:41:55,233
She said yes.

1124
01:41:57,403 --> 01:42:00,197
I asked,
"Will you give me your hand?"

1125
01:42:00,406 --> 01:42:03,533
She said, "You've been
holding it for ten minutes. "

1126
01:42:03,701 --> 01:42:06,077
And she was right.

1127
01:42:08,247 --> 01:42:11,583
So I kept her and her hand
for ten years!

1128
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:17,923
Ten years!
I can't stand that song anymore!

1129
01:42:18,257 --> 01:42:20,383
You hear it?

1130
01:42:20,551 --> 01:42:23,678
I can't stand it anymore.
You hear it?

1131
01:42:24,597 --> 01:42:28,600
That one, right there -
you don't hear it?

1132
01:42:29,685 --> 01:42:34,022
Tell me: Am I crazy?
Come right out and say it!

1133
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:38,276
I want to hear you say it.
Say, "You're crazy!"

1134
01:42:38,444 --> 01:42:41,530
- You're crazy.
- That's more like it.

1135
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:52,999
- Going to the island?
- Yes, sir.

1136
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:55,794
- What's your boat called?
- The Sawonga.

1137
01:42:56,838 --> 01:42:59,297
Just Sawonga's you get me there!

1138
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:13,186
So that song I hear isn't real?

1139
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:16,982
That music
that's haunted me all my life?

1140
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:20,026
That tenderness?
No! Insensitive man!

1141
01:43:21,487 --> 01:43:23,822
You missed the whole point!

1142
01:43:49,265 --> 01:43:51,433
Do you love me

1143
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:43,401
I held her close
and began to cry.

1144
01:44:43,861 --> 01:44:47,530
It was our first,
our only dream.

1145
01:45:10,846 --> 01:45:13,181
Get me Paris, please.

1146
01:45:13,849 --> 01:45:16,434
BALzac 75-02.

1147
01:45:17,561 --> 01:45:20,188
You've forgotten Balzac too?

1148
01:45:21,273 --> 01:45:23,024
Yes, I'll wait.

1149
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:34,035
It hurts.

1150
01:45:37,081 --> 01:45:39,165
You shouldn't have done it.

1151
01:45:52,179 --> 01:45:54,973
You shouldn't have done it.

1152
01:45:58,853 --> 01:46:01,479
Forgive me, Pierrot.

1153
01:46:02,148 --> 01:46:04,274
My name's Ferdinand.

1154
01:46:04,442 --> 01:46:06,234
It's too late.

1155
01:46:15,161 --> 01:46:19,706
"... dynamite, machine guns...
supply the rebels... "

1156
01:46:32,678 --> 01:46:34,971
Yes, I'll wait.

1157
01:46:47,693 --> 01:46:50,278
BALzac 75-02?

1158
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:53,198
Is Mrs. Griffon there?

1159
01:46:55,242 --> 01:46:56,576
Who's this?

1160
01:46:57,244 --> 01:46:59,037
Is that you, Odile?

1161
01:47:00,081 --> 01:47:02,040
How are the children?

1162
01:47:03,793 --> 01:47:06,044
No, no. Nobody's calling.

1163
01:47:13,385 --> 01:47:15,386
"art... death"

1164
01:47:50,798 --> 01:47:53,800
What I wanted to say -

1165
01:47:57,847 --> 01:47:59,514
What's the point?

1166
01:49:00,451 --> 01:49:03,995
What an idiot! Shit!
A glorious death -

1167
01:49:43,619 --> 01:49:45,245
- It's ours again.
- What is?

1168
01:49:45,412 --> 01:49:47,830
- Eternity.
- That's just the sea, gone...

1169
01:49:47,998 --> 01:49:49,832
With the sun.
