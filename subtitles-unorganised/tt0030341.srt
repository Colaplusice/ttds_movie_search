1
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:03,108
- What's all this fuss about, Charters?
- Damned if I know.

2
00:03:09,596 --> 00:03:15,150
Ladies and gentlemen, train is uphold
and if you wish to stay in my hotel...

3
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:17,992
you will have
to register immediately.

4
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,355
Why the deuce didn't he say
so in the first place?

5
00:03:26,602 --> 00:03:31,075
How do you do ladies. It's a great
honour to have you with us again.

6
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,282
It's nice to see you, Boris. You
haven't changed a bit since Friday.

7
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:36,596
- I see you haven't shaved.
- Is everything ready?

8
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:41,046
- Everything. I didn't change anything.
- Not even the sheets? Lead on.

9
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:44,042
I didn't expect
you to come so quickly.

10
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:47,407
Our legs gave out. We had to do
the last lap in a farm cart.

11
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,611
We've company. Don't tell me Cook's
are running cheap tours here.

12
00:03:51,812 --> 00:03:53,643
- What is it, Boris?
- The havelunch!

13
00:03:53,812 --> 00:03:56,691
- Have a lunch?
- Avalanche, Boris.

14
00:03:56,853 --> 00:04:01,406
In spring you've many avalanches. The
snow go boom! Everything disappears.

15
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,931
Even trains disappear
under the avalanche.

16
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:06,565
But I'm going home tomorrow.
How long before they dig it out?

17
00:04:06,737 --> 00:04:10,971
By morning. It's lucky you
can leave by this train.

18
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:14,257
How do you say? It's a bad wind
that blow nowhere no good.

19
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,252
We haven't
eaten since dawn.

20
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:18,332
Serve us some supper,
in our rooms.

21
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:21,221
- I could eat a horse.
- Don't put ideas in his head.

22
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:24,375
Some chicken, Boris.
And a magnum of champagne.

23
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:25,738
And make it snappy.

24
00:04:25,904 --> 00:04:29,261
Bandrika may have a dictator but
tonight we're painting it red.

25
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:33,296
Meanwhile we are here cooling
our heels. What impudence!

26
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:37,017
- 3rd rate country. What do you expect?
- I wonder who those women are.

27
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:41,308
Probably Americans.
Almighty dollar.

28
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,588
We'll have to wait. If only we
hadn't missed that train at Budapest.

29
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:49,383
But you insisted on standing till they
finished their National Anthem...

30
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:53,866
You must show respect. If I knew
it was going to last 20 minutes...

31
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:58,075
It's my contention that the Hungarian
Rhapsody is not their National Anthem.

32
00:04:58,236 --> 00:05:00,831
- We were the only two standing.
- That's true.

33
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:03,428
I suppose we shall be
in time after all.

34
00:05:03,598 --> 00:05:06,750
That last report was pretty ghastly.
England on the brink.

35
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:11,392
Newspaper sensationalism. The old
country's been in tight corners before.

36
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,791
Looks pretty black. Even if
we leave first thing in the morning...

37
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:16,522
there's still a connection at Basle.
We'll probably be hours.

38
00:05:16,682 --> 00:05:19,072
- That's true.
- Somebody surely can help us.

39
00:05:19,243 --> 00:05:22,681
Sir! Do you know what time
the train leaves Basle for England?

40
00:05:24,485 --> 00:05:27,046
Really! Fellow doesn't
speak English.

41
00:05:56,337 --> 00:06:00,616
Here's one leaves Basle, 21:20.

42
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:12,221
There is only two single rooms in
front, or a double room at the back.

43
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:16,053
- We'll take the two single rooms.
- Very well, sir.

44
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:24,267
- You might have asked me.
- A small double room in this place...

45
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:26,180
You weren't so particular
in Paris in Autumn.

46
00:06:26,348 --> 00:06:29,022
That was different.
The Exhibition was at its height.

47
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:32,262
I realise that.
There's no need to rub it in.

48
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,587
- A private suite with a bath.
- Facing the mountains.

49
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:38,470
- With a shower.
- Hot and cold.

50
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:42,388
- And a private thingummy.
- We've only got the maid's room!

51
00:06:42,554 --> 00:06:43,987
- What's this?
- I'm sorry.

52
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,705
- The whole hotel is packed.
- We haven't fixed up yet.

53
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:50,437
You can't expect the two
of us to sleep in the maid's room.

54
00:06:50,597 --> 00:06:52,952
Don't get excited.
I'll move the maid out.

55
00:06:53,118 --> 00:06:56,236
I should think so. What?
What are you taking about.

56
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,071
I'll sleep on the train.

57
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,674
- There is no eating in the train.
- No eating?

58
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:04,715
Heating...

59
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:07,634
That's awkward.
All right we'll take it.

60
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,762
One condition. The maid
has to come to your room...

61
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:14,361
to remove her wardrobe.
Anna!

62
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:20,806
She's a good girl,
and I don't want to lose her.

63
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,213
We'd better go and dress.

64
00:07:40,095 --> 00:07:42,735
- Rather primitive humour, I thought.
- Grown up children.

65
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,091
That was an awkward
situation, over that girl.

66
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,887
Pity he couldn't have given us
one each. I mean a room apiece.

67
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:56,772
I, Iris Matilda Henderson,
a spinster of no particular parish...

68
00:07:56,941 --> 00:08:03,382
solemnly renounce my maidenly past
and declare that on Thursday 26...

69
00:08:04,543 --> 00:08:07,012
I shall take the veil and
orange blossom...

70
00:08:07,184 --> 00:08:11,065
and change my name to
Lady Charles Fotheringail.

71
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:16,739
- Can't he change his name?
- I only like his moustache.

72
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:19,019
You're cynics.
I'm very fond of him.

73
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:22,068
I'm fond of rabbits but they
have to be kept down.

74
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,108
Rudolph, give me a hand.

75
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:33,067
- Do you know that thing called love?
- It used to be very popular.

76
00:08:33,234 --> 00:08:36,272
The carpet is already laid at
St. Georges, Hanover Square...

77
00:08:36,435 --> 00:08:39,872
and Father is aching to have
a coat of arms on the jam label.

78
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:42,267
To Iris, and the happy days
she's leaving behind.

79
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:45,988
And the blue blooded cheque chaser
she's dashing to London to marry.

80
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,712
The blue blooded
cheque chaser.

81
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,915
I've no regrets. I've been everywhere
and done everything.

82
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:58,713
I've eaten caviar at Cannes,
sausage rolls at the dogs.

83
00:08:58,883 --> 00:09:02,560
I've played baccarat at Biarritz
and darts with the rural dean.

84
00:09:03,165 --> 00:09:06,283
What is there left
for me but marriage?

85
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:29,012
Mustn't lose grip, Charters.

86
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:30,210
Come in.

87
00:09:57,785 --> 00:10:01,301
- Did you follow that?
- Tell her this has gone far enough.

88
00:10:01,506 --> 00:10:07,538
No... no.
Change... here. Outside.

89
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,351
- She doesn't understand.
- No, come on.

90
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:02,477
- Nothing newer than last month.
- And no wireless set here.

91
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:06,359
Awful being in the dark like this.
Communications cut off in a crisis.

92
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,807
Hello, hello, London.

93
00:11:09,491 --> 00:11:13,326
You want Mr Seltzer? Yes hold on.
I'm going to find where he is.

94
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:16,166
London!

95
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:21,248
Go on, risk it.

96
00:11:22,575 --> 00:11:27,446
Hello... You... in London. No, I'm not
Mr Seltzer. Name's Charters.

97
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:31,851
I don't suppose you know me. Don't
worry. They've gone to fetch him.

98
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:34,659
Tell me, what's
happening to England?

99
00:11:36,381 --> 00:11:41,980
Blowing a gale? No, I'm inquiring
about the test match in Manchester.

100
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:44,452
Cricket, sir. Cricket!
You don't know?

101
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:47,300
You can't be in England
and not know the test score.

102
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:50,424
The fellow says he doesn't know.
Hello, can't you find out?

103
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:54,785
It won't take a second.
All right, if you won't, you won't.

104
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:56,023
The fellow's an ignoramus.

105
00:11:56,188 --> 00:12:00,023
Mr Seltzer, at last your call's
come through to London.

106
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:01,989
Hello! Hello!

107
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:38,512
Thank you, waiter.

108
00:12:40,444 --> 00:12:42,834
- What about a grilled steak?
- Good idea.

109
00:12:43,005 --> 00:12:44,996
- Well done for me, please.
- On the red side for me.

110
00:12:46,886 --> 00:12:48,878
These people have a passion
for repeating themselves.

111
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:51,084
I beg your pardon.

112
00:12:51,248 --> 00:12:55,800
He's trying to explain that due to the
number of visitors, there's no food.

113
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:00,966
No food? What sort of a place is this?
They expect us to share a dog box...

114
00:13:01,131 --> 00:13:06,002
with a servant on an empty stomach?
Is that hospitality and organisation?

115
00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:07,568
Thank you.

116
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:12,452
- I'm hungry.
- No wonder they have revolutions.

117
00:13:12,615 --> 00:13:17,930
You're welcome to the cheese. It's
not steak but it's rich in vitamins.

118
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,247
Thank you.

119
00:13:19,418 --> 00:13:21,887
We're not accustomed to
catering to so many people.

120
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:25,018
Bandrika is one of
Europe's undiscovered corners.

121
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,570
Perhaps there's nothing
to discover.

122
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:31,621
You may not know it as well as me.
Leaving makes me quite miserable.

123
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:35,619
- After you with that cheese, please!
- Certainly. You're going home?

124
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:40,895
Tomorrow. My charges are grown up.
I'm a governess and a music teacher.

125
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:44,059
In the 6 years that I've lived here,
I've grown to love it.

126
00:13:44,227 --> 00:13:48,062
Especially the mountains. I think that
they are like very friendly neighbours.

127
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:51,620
The father and mother mountains
with their white snow hats...

128
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,545
and their nephews and
nieces, with smaller hats.

129
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:59,102
Right down to their tiniest hillock
without any hat at all.

130
00:13:59,753 --> 00:14:02,712
- Of course, that's just my fancy.
- Really?

131
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:05,867
I like to watch them from my bedroom
every night when there's a moon.

132
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:10,029
I'm so glad there's a moon tonight.
Do you hear that music?

133
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:15,067
Everyone sings here. The people are
just like happy children...

134
00:14:15,238 --> 00:14:17,912
with laughter on their lips
and music in their hearts.

135
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,798
It's not reflected in their politics.

136
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,350
You shouldn't judge
any country by its politics.

137
00:14:22,521 --> 00:14:28,314
We English are quite honest by
nature. You'll excuse me if I run away?

138
00:14:28,843 --> 00:14:30,880
- Good night, good night.
- Good night.

139
00:14:35,926 --> 00:14:37,644
Queer sort of bird.

140
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:42,806
- Trifle whimsical, I thought.
- After 6 years, we'd be whimsical.

141
00:14:43,248 --> 00:14:46,845
I don't think so. She was very decent
about that cheese.

142
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,083
I see she's finished
the pickles.

143
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:53,364
Good night, Iris. Listen,
someone's serenading.

144
00:14:53,532 --> 00:14:57,288
Let him. Nothing will keep me
awake tonight. Good night.

145
00:15:58,436 --> 00:16:02,828
- What's happening? An earthquake?
- That wouldn't account for the music.

146
00:16:02,997 --> 00:16:08,119
- What a noise. What can they be doing?
- I don't know but I'll soon find out.

147
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,436
Hello.

148
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:16,557
Musical country this.

149
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:21,923
I feel quite sorry for that poor singer
outside having to compete with this.

150
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:23,837
Boris?
Miss Henderson speaking.

151
00:16:24,005 --> 00:16:26,679
Someone upstairs is playing
musical chairs with an elephant.

152
00:16:26,846 --> 00:16:29,315
Move one of them out.
I need to sleep.

153
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:33,283
- That'll settle it.
- Thank you.

154
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:38,286
Some people have no consideration,
which makes life more difficult.

155
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,919
Don't you think?
Good night.

156
00:16:41,932 --> 00:16:44,366
You'll be going back
in the morning?

157
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:47,685
I hope we shall meet again
under quieter circumstances.

158
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:50,085
- Good night.
- Good night.

159
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:56,576
Miss, please,
I'll fix everything.

160
00:16:57,937 --> 00:16:59,291
You'd better.

161
00:17:12,103 --> 00:17:14,412
Hold it.
Splendid, don't move.

162
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,579
- lf you please, sir.
- Get out!

163
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,302
One, two.

164
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,301
Please, sir,
will you kindly stop?

165
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:41,426
They are all complaining in the whole
hotel. You make too much noise.

166
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:47,588
- Too much what?
- Too much noise.

167
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:50,224
You dare to call it noise.
The ancient music...

168
00:17:50,396 --> 00:17:54,789
with which your ancestors celebrated
every wedd for countless generations.

169
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,268
What they danced when your
father married your mother...

170
00:17:57,439 --> 00:18:00,557
if you were born in wedlock,
which I doubt. Look at them.

171
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,359
- You are the manager?
- Sure...

172
00:18:04,522 --> 00:18:07,321
I am accustomed to squalor.
Who's complaining?

173
00:18:07,483 --> 00:18:09,599
The young English
lady underneath.

174
00:18:09,764 --> 00:18:14,236
Tell her that I am putting on record
for the benefit of mankind...

175
00:18:14,405 --> 00:18:17,045
one of the lost folk dances
of Central Europe...

176
00:18:17,206 --> 00:18:20,483
and she does not own
the hotel. Get out!

177
00:18:21,648 --> 00:18:24,288
Now, one, two...

178
00:18:33,372 --> 00:18:37,845
He said: "Is she the Queen of Sheeba?
She thinks she owns the hotel."

179
00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:40,973
- Can't you get rid of him?
- Impossible.

180
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:43,330
Are you sure?

181
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:45,692
I begin to wonder...

182
00:18:46,857 --> 00:18:48,610
It's coming back to me.
I have got an idea.

183
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:51,054
The German lady
will call him and say:

184
00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:55,611
"It is my room. I did pay for it.
Get out quickly." How's that?

185
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,339
Good enough.

186
00:19:02,063 --> 00:19:07,422
We will inject him with a little... He'll
never forget as long as he lives.

187
00:19:10,306 --> 00:19:17,737
Nothing but baseball. Children play
it with a rubber ball and a stick.

188
00:19:18,308 --> 00:19:19,947
Not a word about cricket.

189
00:19:20,469 --> 00:19:22,859
Americans have
no sense of proportion.

190
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,540
Come in.

191
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:59,512
Can't stand this ridiculous
lack of privacy. Lock the door.

192
00:20:19,971 --> 00:20:22,088
Who are you?
What do you want?

193
00:20:25,453 --> 00:20:28,332
- Recognise the signature tune?
- Will you please get out?

194
00:20:29,134 --> 00:20:33,607
This is a much better room.
Definitely an acceptable room.

195
00:20:53,423 --> 00:20:57,178
What exactly do you think you're
doing? Keep away!

196
00:21:00,546 --> 00:21:03,345
Would you hold these
for a minute?

197
00:21:08,949 --> 00:21:10,382
Put those back at once.

198
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,343
- Which side do you like to sleep?
- Do you want me to throw you out?

199
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:17,548
In that case,
I'll sleep in the middle.

200
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:28,626
Smart of you
to bribe the manager.

201
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:41,596
An eye for an eye and a tooth
for a toothbrush.

202
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:48,077
- You're behaving like a complete cad.
- You're at liberty to sleep in the corridor.

203
00:21:49,804 --> 00:21:50,919
Hello.

204
00:21:51,564 --> 00:21:55,957
I shouldn't if I were you. I'd only
tell everyone you invited me here.

205
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,997
And when I say everyone, I mean
everyone. I have a powerful voice.

206
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,759
Come out of there at once!

207
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,399
Not until you bribe the manager
to restore me to my attic.

208
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:11,799
Come out!

209
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:41,291
Boris? I might change
my mind about the room upstairs.

210
00:22:44,143 --> 00:22:48,218
Have my things
taken upstairs, will you?

211
00:22:51,626 --> 00:22:54,699
You're the most contemptible person
I've ever met in my life!

212
00:22:54,867 --> 00:22:58,463
I think you're a bit
of a stinker, too.

213
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:12,730
If we get to Basle in time,
we should see the match.

214
00:24:12,896 --> 00:24:16,128
Hope the weather's like this in
Manchester. Perfect for cricket.

215
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:20,937
Isn't it somewhere along here?

216
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:23,933
If you don't hurry, Margaret, we shan't
get that compartment to ourselves.

217
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,818
Does it matter?

218
00:24:31,782 --> 00:24:33,182
There's time
to change your mind.

219
00:24:33,343 --> 00:24:36,302
Send Charles a telegram
and tell him he's all washed up.

220
00:24:36,464 --> 00:24:42,257
This time next week, I shall be a
slightly sunburnt offering on an altar.

221
00:24:42,986 --> 00:24:44,625
I shan't mind, really.

222
00:24:45,467 --> 00:24:50,020
Good morning. I can't find my bag.
It's a brown hold-all.

223
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:54,469
Have you seen it?
No, of course not, thank you.

224
00:24:57,032 --> 00:24:58,545
She's dropped her glasses.

225
00:25:03,314 --> 00:25:06,034
- You dropped your glasses.
- Thank you...

226
00:25:06,315 --> 00:25:07,464
Oh dear! Oh dear!

227
00:25:07,635 --> 00:25:12,028
- Are you hurt?
- I don't know. What was it?

228
00:25:13,838 --> 00:25:17,309
Never mind. This cockeyed station
has practically brained my friend.

229
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:19,755
- Yes, indeed.
- What are you going to do?

230
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,435
- He can't hold the train.
- I like that!

231
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:24,672
- Hurry up. It's going.
- I'm all right.

232
00:25:24,842 --> 00:25:28,313
- Are you sure?
- Don't worry...

233
00:25:28,483 --> 00:25:30,679
I'll look after her.
Such carelessness.

234
00:25:38,607 --> 00:25:41,884
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Send us the Times.

235
00:25:42,048 --> 00:25:45,485
- Write and tell us all about it.
- Good luck. Look after yourself.

236
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:22,297
You'll be all right in a minute.
Just take everything quietly.

237
00:26:23,463 --> 00:26:25,500
Put this eau de cologne
on your head.

238
00:26:46,751 --> 00:26:49,220
- Do you feel any better?
- Yes, thank you. I'm all right.

239
00:26:49,392 --> 00:26:53,512
What you need is a good strong cup
of tea. I'll ring for the attendant.

240
00:26:53,674 --> 00:26:56,872
No, please, don't bother. I'll go to the
dining car myself. I need some air.

241
00:26:57,035 --> 00:27:02,031
- I'll come with you, if you don't mind.
- No, of course not.

242
00:27:15,682 --> 00:27:17,833
I beg your pardon.
I'm so sorry.

243
00:27:19,683 --> 00:27:23,200
You can always tell a honeymoon
couple. They're so shy.

244
00:27:24,765 --> 00:27:26,722
- Why did you do that?
- We don't want people staring.

245
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:29,117
You'd think the whole legal
profession was after you.

246
00:27:29,287 --> 00:27:30,117
One would be enough.

247
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:33,325
You thought that beggar in
Damascus was a barrister.

248
00:27:33,488 --> 00:27:35,639
I just said he looked like
a judge.

249
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:37,801
You hurried off
in the opposite direction.

250
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,166
That's not true. I was looking
for a street called "Straight".

251
00:27:40,331 --> 00:27:43,324
- You weren't so careful at first.
- I know.

252
00:27:43,492 --> 00:27:48,329
And what about me? Robert thinks
I'm cruising with Mother.

253
00:27:57,257 --> 00:28:01,889
If one is feeling shaky, it's best to
sit in the middle of the coach...

254
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:04,373
facing the engine.

255
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,691
- A pot of tea, please.
- Very good.

256
00:28:06,861 --> 00:28:08,533
And just a minute.

257
00:28:09,181 --> 00:28:13,017
Will you please tell them to make it
from this? I don't drink any other.

258
00:28:13,743 --> 00:28:18,341
And make sure the water is
really boiling. Do you understand?

259
00:28:19,145 --> 00:28:23,538
It's a little fad of mine. My dear father
and mother, who are still alive...

260
00:28:23,707 --> 00:28:28,543
and enjoying good health, drink it
and so I follow their footsteps.

261
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:32,982
A million Mexicans drink it. At least
that's what it says on the packet.

262
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,707
It's very kind of you
to help me.

263
00:28:35,871 --> 00:28:37,385
I don't think
we've introduced ourselves.

264
00:28:37,552 --> 00:28:40,272
My name's Iris Henderson,
I'm going home to be married.

265
00:28:40,433 --> 00:28:43,187
How very exciting.
I do hope you'll be happy.

266
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:44,992
- Thank you.
- You'll have children, won't you?

267
00:28:45,154 --> 00:28:49,115
They make such a difference. I always
think it's being with kiddies so much...

268
00:28:49,276 --> 00:28:54,477
that's made me so young for my age.
I'm a governess. My name's Froy.

269
00:28:54,718 --> 00:28:59,077
- Did you say Freud?
- No. O-Y, not E-U-D. Froy.

270
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,559
I'm sorry I can't hear.

271
00:29:10,764 --> 00:29:12,960
Froy. It rhymes with joy.

272
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:19,684
Thank you. Please reserve two places
for lunch, if you'd care to join me.

273
00:29:19,847 --> 00:29:24,684
It wasn't out. But for the umpire's
blunder he'd still be batting.

274
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:28,559
- What do you mean?
- I'll show you. I saw the whole thing.

275
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:35,730
There's Hammond, there's the bowler,
and there's the umpire.

276
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:37,852
- Sugar?
- Two please.

277
00:29:38,614 --> 00:29:40,606
Dear me.
There's no sugar.

278
00:29:41,735 --> 00:29:45,490
Now watch this very carefully.
Grimmett was bowling.

279
00:29:45,777 --> 00:29:49,054
- May I trouble you for the sugar?
- What?

280
00:29:49,418 --> 00:29:50,817
The sugar, please.

281
00:30:06,664 --> 00:30:08,257
Thank you so much.

282
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:25,230
I'd try to get a little sleep,
it'll make you feel quite well.

283
00:30:25,711 --> 00:30:28,590
There's a most intriguing acrostic
in the "Needlewoman".

284
00:30:28,752 --> 00:30:31,586
I'm going to try and
unravel it before you wake up.

285
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:44,973
Reservations for lunch, please.

286
00:31:50,022 --> 00:31:53,618
- Madame has booked for lunch?
- My friend did. She's got the tickets.

287
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:02,139
Have you seen my friend?

288
00:32:03,226 --> 00:32:04,626
My friend, where is she?

289
00:32:06,868 --> 00:32:10,418
La signora inglese.
The English lady.

290
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:12,785
There has been no
English lady here.

291
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,225
What?

292
00:32:14,431 --> 00:32:17,424
There has been
no English lady here.

293
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:19,628
But there has.
She sat there in the corner.

294
00:32:19,993 --> 00:32:22,906
You saw her, you spoke to her,
she sat next to you.

295
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:25,632
Is ridiculous. She took
me to the dining car...

296
00:32:25,795 --> 00:32:29,027
- and came back here with me.
- You went and came back alone.

297
00:32:30,236 --> 00:32:31,511
Maybe you don't understand.

298
00:32:31,677 --> 00:32:33,908
The lady who looked after
me when I was knocked out.

299
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:36,434
Perhaps it make you forget?

300
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:41,198
If this is some sort of a joke
I'm afraid I don't see the point.

301
00:33:14,732 --> 00:33:17,088
- You served me tea just now.
- Yes, Madame.

302
00:33:17,253 --> 00:33:21,567
- Have you seen the lady I was with?
- But Madame was alone.

303
00:33:21,735 --> 00:33:22,804
Pardon, Madame.
He make mistake.

304
00:33:22,975 --> 00:33:26,333
He must remember the English lady.
She ordered tea and paid for it.

305
00:33:26,497 --> 00:33:27,930
No, it was you
who paid for it.

306
00:33:29,738 --> 00:33:31,570
He says to look
at the bill. I will look.

307
00:33:31,739 --> 00:33:34,174
She gave you a special
packet of tea.

308
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,649
The tea was ours.
I received no packet.

309
00:33:36,821 --> 00:33:41,213
- But you did. I know it happened.
- Pardon, the bill. Tea for one.

310
00:33:41,742 --> 00:33:42,971
But that's not right.

311
00:33:43,143 --> 00:33:47,821
- Would you care to examine the bills?
- No. The whole thing's absurd.

312
00:33:55,307 --> 00:33:57,299
Please, have you seen
a lady pass through?

313
00:33:58,148 --> 00:34:01,380
Old Stinker! If I thought
you were on this train...

314
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,543
I'd have stayed a week
at the hotel. Lady? No, why?

315
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:07,385
It doesn't matter. You probably
wouldn't recognise one anyway.

316
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:13,553
- Hello! Feeling queer?
- It's that pipe of yours, George.

317
00:34:13,714 --> 00:34:16,866
Why don't you throw your old socks
away? Thanks for the help.

318
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:19,231
Come on, sit down.
What's the trouble?

319
00:34:19,396 --> 00:34:22,275
- Something fell on my head.
- When? Infancy?

320
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:24,713
- At the station.
- Bad luck! Can I help?

321
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:26,517
No, only by going away.

322
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:29,319
My father taught me
not to dessert a lady in trouble.

323
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,072
He even married mother.

324
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,074
Did you see a little lady last night
in the hotel in tweeds?

325
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:36,312
I saw one but she
was hardly in tweeds.

326
00:34:36,482 --> 00:34:38,678
She was with me,
and now I can't find her.

327
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,675
She must still be on the train.
We haven't stopped.

328
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:44,155
- Of course she is.
- All right. Nobody said she isn't.

329
00:34:44,325 --> 00:34:46,157
- But that's what they say.
- Who?

330
00:34:46,326 --> 00:34:48,237
The people in the compartment
and the steward.

331
00:34:48,407 --> 00:34:51,161
They insist they never saw her.
All of them.

332
00:34:51,488 --> 00:34:54,447
- You said you got a knock on the head.
- What do you mean?

333
00:34:54,609 --> 00:34:57,078
- Never mind. Do you talk the lingo?
- No.

334
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,968
Maybe they thought you tried
to borrow money.

335
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:03,683
Let's knock the idea out of their
heads. A most unfortunate remark.

336
00:35:08,014 --> 00:35:10,130
That's one of them.
The little dark man.

337
00:35:11,575 --> 00:35:15,535
There is a misunderstanding. This
lady seems to have lost her friend.

338
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:19,930
Yes, I have heard. The gentleman
has been explaining to me.

339
00:35:20,178 --> 00:35:23,091
I think under the circumstances
we shall introduce ourselves.

340
00:35:23,259 --> 00:35:25,694
I am an Italian citizen.
My wife and child.

341
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,692
How do you do. Bonny little chap.
How old is he?

342
00:35:27,861 --> 00:35:29,773
1934 class.

343
00:35:29,942 --> 00:35:32,251
And the lady in the corner
is the Baroness Athona.

344
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:35,780
I met her husband, he presented
prizes at the Folk Dances Festival.

345
00:35:35,944 --> 00:35:37,059
Minister of Propaganda.

346
00:35:37,224 --> 00:35:39,944
I am Dr Egon Hartz of Prague.
You may have heard of me.

347
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:42,257
- Not the brain specialist?
- The same.

348
00:35:42,426 --> 00:35:45,225
You went to England to operate
on one of our cabinet ministers.

349
00:35:45,387 --> 00:35:47,424
- Yes.
- Did you find anything?

350
00:35:47,588 --> 00:35:50,899
- A slight cerebral contusion.
- That's better than nothing.

351
00:35:51,069 --> 00:35:54,780
I am picking up a similar case at the
next station, but more complicated.

352
00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:57,182
I shall operate at the
National Hospital tonight.

353
00:35:57,352 --> 00:36:00,425
Among other things a cranial fracture
with completion. You understand?

354
00:36:00,593 --> 00:36:03,870
- Yes, a wallop on the bean.
- I suppose you haven't seen my friend?

355
00:36:04,034 --> 00:36:07,027
- Unfortunately no.
- I'll take a word with the Baroness.

356
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,871
- What do they say?
- Both say they've never seen her.

357
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:23,838
That's not true.
She was sitting there.

358
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:26,675
- Can you describe her?
- It's difficult.

359
00:36:26,842 --> 00:36:29,641
- She was middle-aged and ordinary.
- What was she wearing?

360
00:36:29,803 --> 00:36:34,117
Tweeds, oatmeal flecked with brown,
a coat with patch pockets...

361
00:36:34,285 --> 00:36:38,565
a scarf, felt hat, brown shoes,
a tussle shirt...

362
00:36:38,727 --> 00:36:42,243
and a small blue handkerchief in her
breast pocket. I can't remember.

363
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:45,526
You could've been paying attention.
You both went along to tea?

364
00:36:45,689 --> 00:36:47,726
- Yes.
- Surely you met somebody.

365
00:36:53,692 --> 00:36:55,046
Right you are.
Now let's dig him out.

366
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,648
Pardon. May I come with you?
This is most interesting.

367
00:36:57,814 --> 00:37:00,727
We don't like people muscling in,
but we'll make you a member.

368
00:37:07,857 --> 00:37:10,770
Wait. There was somebody else.
As we passed this compartment...

369
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:13,407
Miss Froy stumbled in and there
was a tall gentleman and a lady.

370
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:15,616
If we can really find someone
who saw her...

371
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,533
we'll have
the place searched.

372
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:19,453
- Can I be of any assistance?
- That's the gentleman.

373
00:37:19,622 --> 00:37:23,536
Do you remember seeing this young lady
pass with a little English woman?

374
00:37:24,383 --> 00:37:26,215
I'm afraid not.

375
00:37:27,384 --> 00:37:29,740
You must! She almost fell
into your compartment.

376
00:37:30,025 --> 00:37:32,096
Surely you haven't forgotten.
It's very important.

377
00:37:32,266 --> 00:37:34,701
Everybody's saying she wasn't here,
but I'm going to find her...

378
00:37:34,867 --> 00:37:37,223
even if
I have to stop the train.

379
00:37:39,029 --> 00:37:41,304
Caldicott, it's Charters.
Can I come in?

380
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:45,707
That girl we saw in the hotel,
she's kicking up a fuss.

381
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:48,864
- Says she lost her friend.
- She hasn't been in here, old man.

382
00:37:49,032 --> 00:37:51,593
- She's threatening to stop the train.
- Lord!

383
00:37:51,753 --> 00:37:54,552
If we miss our connection in Basle,
we'll never make Manchester in time.

384
00:37:54,714 --> 00:37:56,831
- This is serious.
- Let's hide in here.

385
00:37:57,955 --> 00:38:01,393
I haven't the faintest recollection.
You must be making a mistake.

386
00:38:03,077 --> 00:38:06,549
He obviously doesn't remember.
Let's look for the other fellow.

387
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:14,312
- Who were you talking to outside?
- People in the corridor, arguing.

388
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:24,715
- There he is. That's the man.
- I wonder if you can help us.

389
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,922
- How?
- I was having tea an hour ago...

390
00:38:27,086 --> 00:38:28,884
with an English lady.
You saw her, didn't you?

391
00:38:29,047 --> 00:38:32,438
- I was talking to my friend.
- Indubitably.

392
00:38:32,608 --> 00:38:36,124
Yes, but you were at the next table.
She borrowed the sugar.

393
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:38,485
- I recall passing the sugar.
- Then you saw her.

394
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,687
We were in deep conversation,
discussing cricket.

395
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:43,241
How a thing like cricket
can make you forget seeing people?

396
00:38:43,412 --> 00:38:46,246
If that's your attitude,
there's nothing more to say.

397
00:38:46,413 --> 00:38:49,167
Come, Caldicott.
Thing like cricket.

398
00:38:49,414 --> 00:38:52,293
Wrong tactic. We should have told him
we were looking for a cricket ball.

399
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,765
Yes, but he spoke to her.
There must be some explanation.

400
00:38:54,936 --> 00:38:57,087
There is.
Please forgive me.

401
00:38:57,257 --> 00:38:59,374
I'm quite possibly wrong
but I have known cases...

402
00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:03,168
when a sudden shock or blow has
induced the most vivid impressions.

403
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:07,779
- I understand. You don't believe me.
- It's not a question of belief.

404
00:39:07,941 --> 00:39:12,094
Even a concussion may have curious
effects upon an imaginative person.

405
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:16,138
I can remember every little detail.
Her name. Miss Froy. Everything.

406
00:39:16,704 --> 00:39:20,015
So interesting.
If one had time...

407
00:39:20,185 --> 00:39:22,222
one could trace the cause
of the hallucination.

408
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:25,146
- Hallucination?
- Precisely. There is no Miss Froy.

409
00:39:25,307 --> 00:39:29,985
- Just a vivid subjective image.
- But I met her last night at the hotel.

410
00:39:30,149 --> 00:39:32,266
- You thought you did.
- What about her name?

411
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:37,984
A past association. An advertisement,
a character subconsciously remembered.

412
00:39:38,272 --> 00:39:42,186
No, there is no reason to be afraid,
if you are quiet and relaxed.

413
00:39:42,353 --> 00:39:43,867
Thank you very much.

414
00:39:52,037 --> 00:39:56,111
Dravake. If you will excuse me, this
is where my patient comes aboard.

415
00:39:56,278 --> 00:39:57,632
Excuse me.

416
00:39:58,359 --> 00:39:59,952
Most interesting.

417
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,640
We're stopping.

418
00:40:03,081 --> 00:40:06,677
This is our first stop, isn't it?
Miss Froy must still be on the train.

419
00:40:06,842 --> 00:40:09,277
You look out this window
and see if she gets off this side.

420
00:40:09,443 --> 00:40:10,843
I'll take the other.

421
00:40:12,084 --> 00:40:13,803
Most interesting.

422
00:40:20,607 --> 00:40:22,439
What was she dressed in?
Scotch tweeds, wasn't it?

423
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:26,286
- Oatmeal tweeds.
- I knew it had to do with porridge.

424
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:54,009
How long does it take
to get a divorce?

425
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,933
- Eric?
- I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

426
00:40:58,101 --> 00:41:00,821
How long does it take
to get a divorce?

427
00:41:00,982 --> 00:41:02,335
That depends. Why?

428
00:41:02,663 --> 00:41:06,373
I was wondering if we could take
our honey moon next spring.

429
00:41:06,544 --> 00:41:07,863
The official one.

430
00:41:08,665 --> 00:41:12,341
The difficulties are considerable.
The courts are very crowded now.

431
00:41:12,946 --> 00:41:15,415
I suppose we barristers
ought not to complain about this.

432
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:20,945
With conditions as they are now, my
chances of becoming a judge are rosy.

433
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:26,231
- That is, if nothing untoward occurs.
- Like being mixed up in a divorce?

434
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:31,223
In the first careless rapture of yours
you didn't care what happened.

435
00:41:31,393 --> 00:41:35,866
The law, like Caesar's wife,
must be above all suspicion.

436
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,834
Even when the law spends six
weeks with Caesar's wife?

437
00:41:39,676 --> 00:41:42,874
I know why you are running around
like a scared rabbit...

438
00:41:43,037 --> 00:41:45,757
- and why lied so elaborately just now.
- I lied?

439
00:41:45,918 --> 00:41:49,390
Yes, to those people in the corridor.
I heard every word you said.

440
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,998
I didn't wish to be
mixed up in an enquiry.

441
00:41:53,161 --> 00:41:56,234
Enquiry? Just because a little
woman can't be found?

442
00:41:56,402 --> 00:41:58,519
That girl was making a fuss.
If the woman had disappeared...

443
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:01,835
and I'd admitted to seeing her, we
might have become vital witnesses.

444
00:42:02,364 --> 00:42:05,243
My name might appear
in the papers with yours.

445
00:42:05,405 --> 00:42:09,605
A scandal that might
lead anywhere, anywhere.

446
00:42:09,767 --> 00:42:12,328
Yes, I suppose
you are right.

447
00:42:32,695 --> 00:42:34,891
- Nobody?
- Nobody.

448
00:42:35,056 --> 00:42:38,447
I just saw bits of orange peel
and paper bag coming out my side.

449
00:42:38,617 --> 00:42:40,848
I know there's a Miss Froy.
She's as real as you are.

450
00:42:41,018 --> 00:42:42,338
That's what you
say and you believe it.

451
00:42:42,499 --> 00:42:44,456
But there isn't anybody else
who has seen her.

452
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:48,091
- I saw her. I think.
- You did?

453
00:42:48,341 --> 00:42:50,173
- A little woman in tweeds.
- Yes.

454
00:42:50,342 --> 00:42:51,934
- With a three quarter coat.
- With a scarf.

455
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:54,253
That's right. I saw her when
you passed the compartment.

456
00:42:54,423 --> 00:42:57,222
I knew I was right. But your husband
said he didn't see her.

457
00:42:57,384 --> 00:43:00,457
He didn't notice, but as soon as he
mentioned it, I remembered at once.

458
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:03,778
You win. This calls for action.
Would you make a statement?

459
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:05,062
Of course, if it helps.

460
00:43:05,227 --> 00:43:08,220
Pardon, my patient has just arrived.
The most fascinating complication.

461
00:43:08,388 --> 00:43:10,949
We have news for you.
This lady saw Mrs. Froy.

462
00:43:11,109 --> 00:43:12,543
- So.
- We are going to search the train.

463
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:15,305
- You must think of a fresh theory.
- It is not necessary.

464
00:43:15,471 --> 00:43:18,191
My theory was perfectly good.
The facts were misleading.

465
00:43:18,352 --> 00:43:20,469
I hope you will find
your friend.

466
00:43:20,633 --> 00:43:23,194
- I'll be right here if you want me.
- OK. Come along.

467
00:43:32,037 --> 00:43:35,030
I was going to mention that
I told that girl I'd seen her friend.

468
00:43:35,198 --> 00:43:39,512
- Have you taken leave of your senses?
- On the contrary, I've come to them.

469
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,670
What do you mean?

470
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,675
If there is a scandal, there'll be
a divorce. You couldn't let me down.

471
00:43:44,842 --> 00:43:48,233
You'd have to do the decent thing
as only you know how.

472
00:43:48,763 --> 00:43:50,720
You forgot one very important
thing, Margaret...

473
00:43:50,884 --> 00:43:52,875
your husband would divorce you,
no doubt.

474
00:43:53,045 --> 00:43:55,354
But my wife
will never divorce me.

475
00:43:57,206 --> 00:44:00,119
It may seem crazy to you, but
you're going to search the train.

476
00:44:01,047 --> 00:44:03,801
Down there, they look for you.
Your friend come back.

477
00:44:03,969 --> 00:44:06,085
Come back?
But what happened?

478
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,881
You go see.
She tell you.

479
00:44:10,171 --> 00:44:13,926
All right Athleston, relax. The crisis
is over. Come on, let's join the lady.

480
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:17,361
Miss Froy.

481
00:44:21,255 --> 00:44:22,529
That isn't Miss Froy.

482
00:44:22,935 --> 00:44:24,164
- Isn't it?
- No.

483
00:44:24,856 --> 00:44:31,127
- It's silly to say, but are you Miss Froy?
- No, I am Madame Kummer.

484
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,530
She helped you into the carriage
and went to see some friends.

485
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:44,693
As you spoke about an English lady she
didn't connect her with Mme Kummer.

486
00:44:44,863 --> 00:44:47,094
But she wasn't the lady.
It was Miss Froy.

487
00:44:47,264 --> 00:44:51,623
- Oatmeal tweeds, blue handkerchief...
- Yes, it's all the same, but it isn't her.

488
00:44:51,786 --> 00:44:54,665
When did you say you first
met this Miss Froy?

489
00:44:54,827 --> 00:44:56,227
Last night at the hotel.

490
00:44:56,388 --> 00:44:59,699
- Was she wearing a costume like this?
- Yes, I think she was.

491
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:02,509
Then I apologise.
You did meet her.

492
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:05,265
But not on the train.
In your subconscious mind...

493
00:45:05,431 --> 00:45:07,866
you substituted the face of
Mme Kummer with Miss Froy's.

494
00:45:08,032 --> 00:45:10,593
But I didn't. I couldn't have,
I talked to her here.

495
00:45:10,753 --> 00:45:12,984
That's easily settled, there's
a woman who said she saw her.

496
00:45:13,154 --> 00:45:14,473
If the lady wouldn't mind.

497
00:45:19,956 --> 00:45:21,948
What a gift of languages
the fellow's got.

498
00:45:32,881 --> 00:45:36,795
- Is this the woman you saw?
- It isn't a bit like her, is it?

499
00:45:40,203 --> 00:45:42,513
Yes, she's the woman.

500
00:45:42,684 --> 00:45:45,199
- But it isn't. I tell you it isn't.
- Are you sure?

501
00:45:47,126 --> 00:45:49,800
- Perfectly.
- She isn't. She isn't.

502
00:45:54,849 --> 00:45:56,726
I'm so sorry
to have troubled you.

503
00:45:59,531 --> 00:46:02,251
Aren't you going
to say anything?

504
00:46:02,412 --> 00:46:05,007
- You might at least gloat.
- What am I expected to say?

505
00:46:05,173 --> 00:46:07,243
You only did it
to save your own skin.

506
00:46:07,413 --> 00:46:10,646
She was lying. I saw it in her face.
They're all lying. But why?

507
00:46:10,815 --> 00:46:12,168
Why don't you sit
down and take it easy.

508
00:46:12,335 --> 00:46:15,726
Do you believe this nonsense
about substituting faces?

509
00:46:15,896 --> 00:46:17,489
I think any change
would be an improvement.

510
00:46:17,657 --> 00:46:21,732
Miss Froy was on this train, and
nothing will convince me otherwise.

511
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:25,010
Must you follow
me round like a pet dog?

512
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,969
- A watch dog. I have better instincts.
- Goodbye.

513
00:46:48,068 --> 00:46:50,458
The Doctor was right.
I never saw Miss Froy on the train.

514
00:46:50,629 --> 00:46:53,827
- It didn't happen, I know now.
- Glad you're taking it like that.

515
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:57,028
Forget all about it.
Make your mind a blank.

516
00:46:58,152 --> 00:47:00,348
Watch me,
you can't go wrong.

517
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:02,505
What about a spot
of something to eat?

518
00:47:02,673 --> 00:47:04,665
- Anything.
- That's right, come along.

519
00:47:14,478 --> 00:47:16,674
- Would you like some air?
- Thanks.

520
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,271
- Could you eat something?
- I could try.

521
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,557
That's the spirit. You'll feel
a different girl tomorrow.

522
00:47:23,721 --> 00:47:26,953
I hope so. I don't want to meet
my fiance a nervous wreck.

523
00:47:28,163 --> 00:47:31,361
- Your what?
- I'm being married on Thursday.

524
00:47:32,164 --> 00:47:34,963
- You're sure you're not imagining that?
- Positive.

525
00:47:35,525 --> 00:47:39,361
- I was afraid so. Food.
- I couldn't face it.

526
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:41,245
Do you mind if I talk
with my mouth full?

527
00:47:41,408 --> 00:47:42,557
If you must.

528
00:47:42,728 --> 00:47:45,960
- Want to hear about my early life?
- I don't think so.

529
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:47,848
Since you press me,
I'll begin with my father.

530
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:50,479
It's remarkable how many great
men began with their fathers.

531
00:47:50,651 --> 00:47:53,849
- Something to drink?
- No. Yes. A cup of tea, please.

532
00:47:54,012 --> 00:47:58,963
One tea and no soup for the lady.
My father was a colourful character.

533
00:47:59,134 --> 00:48:02,810
Amongst other things, he was strongly
addicted to you'll never guess.

534
00:48:02,975 --> 00:48:04,295
Harriman's Herbal Tea.

535
00:48:04,456 --> 00:48:07,654
- No, double scotches.
- A million Mexicans drink it.

536
00:48:07,817 --> 00:48:11,015
- Maybe, but Father didn't.
- Miss Froy gave a packet to the waiter.

537
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:14,055
- A packet of what?
- Harriman's Herbal Tea.

538
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:15,653
It was the only sort she liked.

539
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,381
We agreed you were going to make
your mind a complete blank.

540
00:48:18,661 --> 00:48:22,257
- It's so real. I'm sure it happened.
- Did we or did we not?

541
00:48:22,663 --> 00:48:27,101
We did. Sorry.
Tell me about your father.

542
00:48:27,664 --> 00:48:31,898
- My father was a very remarkable man.
- Did he play the clarinet?

543
00:48:32,066 --> 00:48:36,219
He did. In fact he never put it down
unless it became absolutely necessary.

544
00:48:36,388 --> 00:48:38,777
I couldn't help inheriting
his love of music.

545
00:48:39,069 --> 00:48:41,299
- Why not?
- That was all he left me.

546
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:46,263
You're remarkably attractive.
Has anyone ever told you?

547
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,150
We were discussing you.

548
00:48:48,312 --> 00:48:51,544
- Yes, of course. Do you like me?
- Not much.

549
00:48:53,594 --> 00:48:58,191
I paid my father's debts and went
away before they cashed the cheques.

550
00:48:58,356 --> 00:49:00,995
I'm writing a book
on folk dancing.

551
00:49:01,157 --> 00:49:03,113
- Would you like to buy a copy?
- I'd love to.

552
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:06,156
- When does it see the light of day?
- In about four years.

553
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,992
- That's a very long time.
- It's a very long book.

554
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,118
Do you know why
you fascinate me?

555
00:49:13,281 --> 00:49:15,955
I'll tell you. You have the great
qualities I used to admire in my father.

556
00:49:16,122 --> 00:49:20,002
You've no manners at all, and
you're always seeing things.

557
00:49:21,244 --> 00:49:23,395
- What's the matter?
- Look!

558
00:49:30,647 --> 00:49:32,445
- It's gone!
- What's gone?

559
00:49:32,608 --> 00:49:34,281
Miss Froy's name
on the window.

560
00:49:34,449 --> 00:49:36,405
You must have seen it.
She's on the train.

561
00:49:36,569 --> 00:49:38,003
Steady! Steady!

562
00:49:40,851 --> 00:49:44,208
We've got to find her. Something's
happening to her. Stop the train.

563
00:49:45,413 --> 00:49:47,688
Listen everybody. There's a
woman on the train, Miss Froy...

564
00:49:47,854 --> 00:49:50,209
you must have seen her.
They hide her somewhere.

565
00:49:50,374 --> 00:49:53,173
I appeal to you
all to stop the train.

566
00:49:53,336 --> 00:49:55,566
Please help me.
Please stop the train.

567
00:49:55,736 --> 00:49:58,729
Do you hear me?
Do something before it's too late!

568
00:49:58,898 --> 00:50:02,494
I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm
not. For heaven's sake, stop this train.

569
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:05,216
Leave me alone.
Leave me alone.

570
00:50:20,305 --> 00:50:23,184
Ten minutes late
thanks to that girl.

571
00:50:23,386 --> 00:50:26,539
Any more tricks and we shall be
late for the last day of the match.

572
00:50:27,748 --> 00:50:30,422
- You couldn't put it to her in some way.
- What?

573
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:35,580
- People just don't vanish and so forth.
- But she has.

574
00:50:36,271 --> 00:50:36,862
What?

575
00:50:37,832 --> 00:50:38,708
Vanished.

576
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:40,591
- Who?
- The old dame.

577
00:50:41,593 --> 00:50:43,027
- Yes.
- Well?

578
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:46,670
- But how could she?
- What?

579
00:50:47,475 --> 00:50:49,944
- Vanish.
- I don't know.

580
00:50:50,396 --> 00:50:54,311
That just explains my point. People
just don't disappear into thin air.

581
00:50:54,878 --> 00:50:57,473
- It's done in India.
- What?

582
00:50:58,039 --> 00:50:59,439
The rope trick.

583
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,998
Oh that. It never comes
out in a photograph.

584
00:51:04,001 --> 00:51:08,042
In half an hour we stop at Morsken,
just before the border.

585
00:51:08,203 --> 00:51:11,514
I will leave there with my
patient for the National Hospital.

586
00:51:11,684 --> 00:51:15,564
If you will come with me, you could
stay overnight in a private ward.

587
00:51:15,725 --> 00:51:18,924
- You need peace and rest.
- Sorry, nothing doing.

588
00:51:19,087 --> 00:51:22,842
- Isn't there anything we can do?
- Yes, find Miss Froy.

589
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:32,048
If she does not rest
I will not answer for her.

590
00:51:32,772 --> 00:51:35,446
It will be best if you persuade her.
She likes you.

591
00:51:35,613 --> 00:51:38,082
I'm as popular as a dose
of strychnine.

592
00:51:38,254 --> 00:51:40,849
If coated with sugar,
she may swallow it.

593
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:25,707
Cosmopolitan train.
People of all nations.

594
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:30,623
I've just seen at least a million
Mexicans in the corridor.

595
00:52:33,434 --> 00:52:36,154
Think over what
Doctor Hertz said.

596
00:52:36,315 --> 00:52:38,876
If you feel like changing
your mind, I'll be around.

597
00:52:46,679 --> 00:52:48,192
- What's all the mystery?
- You're right.

598
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:50,715
Miss Froy is on the this train.
I've just seen that packet of tea.

599
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,473
They chucked it out
with the rubbish.

600
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:55,236
- You're late. She may be dead now.
- Dead or alive...

601
00:52:55,402 --> 00:52:59,635
Anyway, I remember once spending
a bank holiday at Brighton...

602
00:53:00,203 --> 00:53:03,242
Let's search this train. There's
something definitely queer in the air.

603
00:53:19,731 --> 00:53:22,644
It's a supply service
for trunk murderers.

604
00:53:30,855 --> 00:53:32,083
What's this?

605
00:53:36,217 --> 00:53:39,369
- It's all right, It's only us.
- Hurry up. Quickly.

606
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,297
Maybe it's Miss Froy
bewitched.

607
00:53:48,861 --> 00:53:51,899
I refused to be discouraged.
Faint heart never found old lady.

608
00:53:54,263 --> 00:53:56,334
- Do you know anything about her?
- No.

609
00:53:56,504 --> 00:53:58,496
Only that she is a governess
going home.

610
00:54:02,746 --> 00:54:04,738
- What is this thing?
- Can't imagine.

611
00:54:04,907 --> 00:54:07,058
There might be
something down here.

612
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:12,504
- What on earth!
- Our Italian friend.

613
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:17,145
I've got it. There.
The Great Doppo.

614
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:26,147
- His visiting card. Look!
- What's it say?

615
00:54:26,315 --> 00:54:28,511
The Great Doppo. Magician,
illusionist, mind reader...

616
00:54:28,676 --> 00:54:31,510
he will appear in all the towns and
cities. See his fascinating act...

617
00:54:31,837 --> 00:54:35,797
- The Vanishing Lady.
- The Vanishing Lady.

618
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:38,429
- Perhaps that's the explanation.
- What?

619
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:42,389
- Maybe he's practising on Miss Froy.
- Perhaps it's a publicity stunt.

620
00:54:42,561 --> 00:54:45,281
No. That wouldn't account for
the Baroness or Madame Kummer.

621
00:54:45,442 --> 00:54:48,196
- What's your theory?
- I don't know. My theory?

622
00:54:49,283 --> 00:54:50,512
I'll tell you.

623
00:54:55,165 --> 00:54:57,964
Oh dear.
I can't get this one.

624
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:10,528
- Where are you?
- Here with a smell of camphor balls.

625
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:13,852
- I can't see you.
- I'm about somewhere.

626
00:55:15,773 --> 00:55:19,687
- Here I am. Where are you?
- I don't know.

627
00:55:20,214 --> 00:55:22,604
That's what comes of not saying
Abracadabra.

628
00:55:23,816 --> 00:55:27,605
- Are you hurt?
- Not much.

629
00:55:27,937 --> 00:55:30,452
- Come and sit down over here.
- What is this thing?

630
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:32,974
In magic circles, we cal
it the disappearing cabinet.

631
00:55:33,139 --> 00:55:36,530
- You get inside and vanish.
- So I noticed.

632
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,818
- You were about to tell me your theory.
- My theory.

633
00:55:41,022 --> 00:55:45,540
My theory, dear Watson, is that we
are in very deep waters indeed.

634
00:55:46,984 --> 00:55:51,343
Thank you. Let us marshal our facts
over a pipeful of Baker Street shag.

635
00:55:51,626 --> 00:55:56,463
A little old lady disappears. Everyone
that saw her says she wasn't there.

636
00:55:56,628 --> 00:55:57,663
Right?

637
00:55:57,828 --> 00:56:02,779
But she was. Therefor, they did see
her. Therefor, they are lying. Why?

638
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:05,943
- I don't know. I'm just Watson.
- Don't bury yourself it the part.

639
00:56:06,111 --> 00:56:08,546
Because they
daren't face an enquiry...

640
00:56:08,712 --> 00:56:10,829
because Miss Froy's probably
still somewhere on the train.

641
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:13,872
- I told you that hours ago.
- So you did.

642
00:56:14,034 --> 00:56:16,549
For that you shall have
a trichonoply cigar.

643
00:56:17,115 --> 00:56:20,028
There's only one thing left to
do. Search the train in disguise.

644
00:56:20,196 --> 00:56:21,346
As what?

645
00:56:24,878 --> 00:56:27,313
- Old English gentleman.
- They'd see through you.

646
00:56:27,479 --> 00:56:28,753
Perhaps you're right.

647
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:36,282
Will Hay. "No, boys, which one of
you has stolen Miss Froy? Own up."

648
00:56:36,442 --> 00:56:38,559
- Those glasses. Give them to me.
- Why?

649
00:56:38,723 --> 00:56:40,476
- They're Miss Froy's.
- Are you sure?

650
00:56:40,644 --> 00:56:43,205
They're the same. Gold rimmed.
Where did you find them?

651
00:56:43,365 --> 00:56:46,358
- On the floor. The glass is broken.
- Probably in the struggle.

652
00:56:46,526 --> 00:56:47,845
Pick up the glass.

653
00:56:48,126 --> 00:56:51,085
Do you realise that this is our first
piece of really tangible proof?

654
00:56:52,448 --> 00:56:53,597
That's the lot.

655
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:02,761
Will you give me those spectacles.
They belong to me. My spectacles.

656
00:57:02,932 --> 00:57:04,570
Yours? Are you sure?

657
00:57:06,893 --> 00:57:11,650
Naughty. That's a very large nose
for a very small pair of spectacles.

658
00:57:12,335 --> 00:57:14,611
Is that the game?
We'll see about that.

659
00:57:14,776 --> 00:57:18,850
These are Miss Froy's glasses.
She's been in here and you know it.

660
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:34,294
Well don't stand hoping about like
a referee, co-operate. Kick him.

661
00:57:41,986 --> 00:57:43,465
That doesn't help.

662
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:50,667
Quick, pull his ears back.
Give them a twist.

663
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,596
 He's got a knife!

664
00:58:15,798 --> 00:58:18,188
Get hold of it before
he cuts a slice off me.

665
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,238
I can't reach it.

666
00:58:31,204 --> 00:58:32,603
Well done.

667
00:58:38,446 --> 00:58:41,007
We know how that thing works.
Come out of there.

668
00:58:43,128 --> 00:58:45,597
Is he out, do you think?
We've got to hide somewhere.

669
00:58:46,249 --> 00:58:49,560
- I wonder what's in here?
- Hurry up!

670
00:58:53,652 --> 00:58:55,211
It's empty.
Bring him along.

671
00:59:08,377 --> 00:59:11,575
- What's the matter?
- Garlic. I'll be all right in a minute.

672
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:14,768
- Here, hold on to this.
- Yes.

673
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,819
We know that Miss Froy
was on this train...

674
00:59:17,981 --> 00:59:20,257
and that our friend
had something to do with it.

675
00:59:20,422 --> 00:59:23,256
That ought to keep him.

676
00:59:23,663 --> 00:59:26,622
Hard work, but worth it.
Let's have the evidence.

677
00:59:26,784 --> 00:59:28,377
- Evidence?
- Yes, the glasses.

678
00:59:28,545 --> 00:59:30,024
You've got them.

679
00:59:30,425 --> 00:59:34,705
No, I haven't got them.
He's got them.

680
00:59:35,707 --> 00:59:37,107
He isn't there.

681
00:59:41,629 --> 00:59:44,622
Snookered.
It's a false bottom.

682
00:59:46,431 --> 00:59:48,741
- The twister! He's a contortionist.
- He's gone all right.

683
00:59:48,912 --> 00:59:51,347
To find the others
and make more trouble.

684
00:59:51,513 --> 00:59:53,232
We can't fight the whole train.

685
00:59:53,394 --> 00:59:55,784
- But who can we trust?
- That's the snag.

686
00:59:55,955 --> 00:59:59,107
- There's the Doctor Hartz person.
- Yes, you're right. He might help.

687
00:59:59,276 --> 01:00:02,633
- Let's tell him the symptoms.
- All right. Wait a minute.

688
01:00:15,802 --> 01:00:17,030
This is the one.

689
01:00:22,284 --> 01:00:23,638
He's not there.

690
01:00:28,246 --> 01:00:31,125
- I've had a particularly idiotic idea.
- I can't believe that.

691
01:00:31,287 --> 01:00:34,326
Suppose that patient in there
is Miss Froy.

692
01:00:34,489 --> 01:00:37,482
But it didn't come on the train until
after Miss Froy had disappeared.

693
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:40,645
That's why it's an idiotic idea.
Let's find the doctor.

694
01:00:40,811 --> 01:00:43,531
- No, wait a minute.
- What is it?

695
01:00:44,452 --> 01:00:47,650
- Notice anything wrong with that nun?
- No.

696
01:00:47,813 --> 01:00:50,692
I don't think she's a nun at all.
They don't wear high heels.

697
01:01:04,099 --> 01:01:08,299
You're right. Did you see Mme
Kummer get on the train?

698
01:01:08,461 --> 01:01:09,257
No.

699
01:01:10,102 --> 01:01:13,698
Supposing they decoyed Miss Froy
into the luggage van and hid her.

700
01:01:13,863 --> 01:01:17,618
At the first stop the patient comes
abroad. Head injury, all wrapped up.

701
01:01:17,784 --> 01:01:20,458
The patient is Madame Kummer
and she becomes Miss Froy...

702
01:01:20,625 --> 01:01:23,186
and Miss Froy becomes that.

703
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:26,897
But why go to all this trouble to
kidnap a little harmless governess?

704
01:01:27,068 --> 01:01:31,108
It isn't a governess at all.
Perhaps it's some political thing.

705
01:01:31,869 --> 01:01:33,303
Let's investigate.

706
01:01:41,473 --> 01:01:42,906
You'll just have to put up
with it in English.

707
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:45,828
Can we take a look at your patient,
please? Thank you.

708
01:01:46,075 --> 01:01:47,667
Keep an eye on the nun.

709
01:01:52,277 --> 01:01:53,835
What are you doing here?

710
01:01:56,158 --> 01:01:57,672
Why are you in here?

711
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:02,437
This is a most serious accident case.
You have no business to be here.

712
01:02:02,601 --> 01:02:05,560
We want you to undo the bandages
and let us see your patients face.

713
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,795
Are you out of your senses?
There is no face there.

714
01:02:08,963 --> 01:02:12,843
Nothing but lumps of new flesh.
The case has lost so much blood...

715
01:02:13,004 --> 01:02:14,597
nothing but a transfusion
can save him.

716
01:02:14,765 --> 01:02:16,165
What do you want me to do?
Murder my patient?

717
01:02:16,326 --> 01:02:20,878
- You're sure that this is your patient?
- We believe it's Miss Froy.

718
01:02:21,047 --> 01:02:26,123
You can't be serious. What on
earth put such ideas into your heads?

719
01:02:31,011 --> 01:02:33,970
- I understand she is deaf and dumb.
- But she may lip read.

720
01:02:34,132 --> 01:02:38,685
That's possible. In that case, perhaps
you will join me in the dining car?

721
01:02:39,014 --> 01:02:43,008
I'll be with you in a moment. I want to be
certain my patient hasn't been disturbed.

722
01:02:48,257 --> 01:02:52,093
How do I know how they cottoned on?
Somebody must have tipped them off.

723
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:59,454
- You never said the girl was English.
- What difference does it make?

724
01:03:00,222 --> 01:03:03,135
In a few minutes, I will order three
drinks in the dining car.

725
01:03:03,303 --> 01:03:04,941
Mine will be Chartreuse.

726
01:03:05,103 --> 01:03:08,654
One of the stewards is working
for us. Listen carefully.

727
01:03:14,347 --> 01:03:15,746
There's that girl again.

728
01:03:17,468 --> 01:03:20,541
Seems to have recovered.
Lucky it blew over.

729
01:03:29,832 --> 01:03:34,191
- You'll tell me what it's all about?
- Have you actually seen your patient?

730
01:03:34,554 --> 01:03:37,513
No, I received a message to pick
the case up and operate at Morsken.

731
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:40,714
- How do you know its not Miss Froy.
- We think there's been a change.

732
01:03:40,876 --> 01:03:42,993
You think
that someone has...

733
01:03:44,478 --> 01:03:47,630
I want a green chartreuse.
Won't you join me?

734
01:03:47,799 --> 01:03:50,109
- I'll like a large brandy, please.
- And you?

735
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,191
- Nothing, thank you.
- It'll do you good.

736
01:03:53,561 --> 01:03:55,314
You are very tired.
It will pick you up.

737
01:03:57,122 --> 01:04:00,479
- All right, just a small one.
- 2 brandies and a Chartreuse.

738
01:04:02,604 --> 01:04:06,485
Do you know anything about the nun
who is looking after the patient?

739
01:04:06,966 --> 01:04:10,437
Nun? No. She is from the convent
where the accident occurred.

740
01:04:10,607 --> 01:04:13,884
Don't you think it is curious that
she's wearing high heeled shoes?

741
01:04:14,689 --> 01:04:18,808
Is she? That is
rather curious, isn't it?

742
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:20,729
A conspiracy.
That's all it can be.

743
01:04:20,891 --> 01:04:23,725
These people on the train say
they haven't seen Miss Froy.

744
01:04:23,892 --> 01:04:25,724
We know because
in the luggage van...

745
01:04:25,893 --> 01:04:27,326
She's off again!

746
01:04:28,013 --> 01:04:32,327
Puts the lid on our getting back
in time, if she did.

747
01:04:32,495 --> 01:04:34,566
Then this fellow from
the carriage, Doppo...

748
01:04:34,736 --> 01:04:36,249
he came along
and grabbed the glasses.

749
01:04:36,417 --> 01:04:38,487
Then we went for him
and had a fight.

750
01:04:38,777 --> 01:04:40,973
- A fight?
- We knocked him out.

751
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:50,136
- Seems to have made a speedy recovery.
- Yes. That's just bluff.

752
01:04:58,825 --> 01:05:02,899
How could he be involved in a
conspiracy? Look at the poor fellow.

753
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,420
He's just a harmless traveller.

754
01:05:04,587 --> 01:05:07,022
He's a musical artist on a tour
of Bandrika.

755
01:05:07,668 --> 01:05:09,660
The Baroness' husband is
Minister of Propaganda.

756
01:05:09,829 --> 01:05:12,024
One word from her and
his tour would be cancelled.

757
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:13,147
I see.

758
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:17,429
And the stewards would got a
nice cosy brick wall to lean against.

759
01:05:19,712 --> 01:05:21,669
But tell me about
the two English travellers.

760
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:25,224
- They also denied seeing her?
- British diplomacy, doctor.

761
01:05:25,394 --> 01:05:28,387
Never climb a fence if you can sit
on it. Old Foreign Office proverb.

762
01:05:28,555 --> 01:05:32,266
Why should someone want
to dispose of the old lady?

763
01:05:32,437 --> 01:05:36,556
That stumps us. All we know is she
was on this train and now she's...

764
01:05:38,759 --> 01:05:39,829
gone.

765
01:05:42,361 --> 01:05:45,798
If you're right, it means the whole
train is against us.

766
01:05:45,962 --> 01:05:47,600
What are we going to do?

767
01:05:48,643 --> 01:05:52,398
In view of what you've just told me,
I'll risk examining my patient.

768
01:05:53,885 --> 01:05:58,915
We mustn't act suspiciously.
Behave as if nothing had happened.

769
01:06:00,967 --> 01:06:02,765
Drink, that'll steady
your nerves.

770
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:12,646
To our health. And may
our enemies, if they exist...

771
01:06:12,812 --> 01:06:14,768
be unconscious of
our purpose.

772
01:06:18,654 --> 01:06:20,372
Let's go. We
must hurry now.

773
01:06:21,415 --> 01:06:22,973
Come on, drink up.

774
01:06:37,941 --> 01:06:39,169
Wait in here.

775
01:06:40,302 --> 01:06:41,496
Right you are.

776
01:06:46,184 --> 01:06:48,175
- Anything wrong?
- Nothing.

777
01:06:48,905 --> 01:06:51,340
Except they noticed you
were wearing high heels.

778
01:06:52,946 --> 01:06:54,699
But it makes no difference.

779
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:57,379
We shall reach Morsken
in 3 minutes.

780
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:00,826
Quite an eventful journey.

781
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:05,705
Well?

782
01:07:06,311 --> 01:07:08,780
Yes, the patient is Miss Froy.

783
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:11,991
She will be taken off
the train in 3 minutes.

784
01:07:12,393 --> 01:07:15,386
She will be removed to the hospital
there and operated on.

785
01:07:15,634 --> 01:07:18,388
The operation will
not be successful.

786
01:07:19,756 --> 01:07:25,276
I should perhaps explain that the
operation will be performed by me.

787
01:07:34,121 --> 01:07:37,877
I am in this conspiracy
as you term it.

788
01:07:40,644 --> 01:07:42,760
You are a very
alert young couple...

789
01:07:42,924 --> 01:07:46,919
but it's quite useless for you to
think of a way out of your dilemma.

790
01:07:47,446 --> 01:07:51,486
The drink you've had now, I regret to
say, contained a quantity of Hydrocin.

791
01:07:52,688 --> 01:07:57,525
Hydrocin is a very little known
drug which has the effect...

792
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:00,330
of paralysing the brain and
rendering the victim unconscious...

793
01:08:00,491 --> 01:08:02,209
for a considerable period.

794
01:08:02,531 --> 01:08:06,242
In a larger quantity,
it induces madness.

795
01:08:07,773 --> 01:08:11,211
However the dose was
a normal one.

796
01:08:16,457 --> 01:08:19,336
Soon you will join your
young friend.

797
01:08:20,658 --> 01:08:26,974
Need I say how sorry I am feeling
to take such a melodramatic course.

798
01:08:28,701 --> 01:08:30,977
But your persistent meddling
made it necessary.

799
01:08:46,587 --> 01:08:48,419
Are you all right?
You must have fainted.

800
01:08:49,429 --> 01:08:51,465
There is a woman next door
going to be murdered...

801
01:08:51,629 --> 01:08:54,508
and we've got to get moving
before this stuff takes effect.

802
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:56,901
If you keep on the go you
can stay awake.

803
01:08:57,071 --> 01:08:59,142
Right, come on,
let's get going.

804
01:09:00,633 --> 01:09:01,827
It's locked.

805
01:09:04,434 --> 01:09:06,426
We can't go that way.
We'll be spotted.

806
01:09:07,755 --> 01:09:09,747
- You can't do that!
- Don't worry, it's only next door...

807
01:09:09,916 --> 01:09:11,475
you carry on keeping fit,
touch your toes...

808
01:09:11,637 --> 01:09:14,436
stand your head, do anything
but fall asleep.

809
01:09:54,652 --> 01:09:57,929
You needn't be afraid,
it is Miss Froy.

810
01:10:00,214 --> 01:10:02,171
It's all right,
you haven't been drugged.

811
01:10:02,335 --> 01:10:04,611
He told me to put something
in your drinks but I didn't do it.

812
01:10:04,776 --> 01:10:06,768
Who the devil are you?
He said you were deaf and dumb.

813
01:10:06,977 --> 01:10:10,129
Never mind about that now, if you
want to save her you've got to hurry.

814
01:10:24,623 --> 01:10:26,535
What's gonna happen now?

815
01:10:26,704 --> 01:10:28,296
Let's hold them off until
past Morsken...

816
01:10:28,465 --> 01:10:30,456
the frontier's a few miles
beyond the station.

817
01:10:37,428 --> 01:10:38,986
Come on, there's still time.

818
01:10:56,955 --> 01:10:59,265
That's Morsken.
Have you finished?

819
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,150
Come on, Miss Froy.

820
01:11:05,358 --> 01:11:08,556
Come on kid, you're not drugged,
I'll explain later. Abracadabra.

821
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:14,559
- Miss Froy, I can't believe it!
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

822
01:11:14,721 --> 01:11:15,871
Careful.

823
01:11:24,885 --> 01:11:25,954
Ready?

824
01:11:26,726 --> 01:11:27,761
Yes.

825
01:11:57,777 --> 01:11:59,689
- Are you all right, Miss Froy?
- Yes, thank you.

826
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:02,054
It's rather like the rush hour
on the underground.

827
01:12:07,541 --> 01:12:08,894
We're slowing down.

828
01:12:51,436 --> 01:12:54,190
I'm sorry you've had such an
uncomfortable journey, Miss Froy.

829
01:13:18,766 --> 01:13:20,280
Get back on the train.

830
01:13:41,695 --> 01:13:43,526
I hope nothing goes wrong.

831
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:45,894
Aren't we stopping
rather a long time?

832
01:13:47,977 --> 01:13:50,014
The ambulance is going.
We'll be off in a jiffy.

833
01:14:06,184 --> 01:14:07,981
Another couple of minutes,
we'll be over the border.

834
01:14:12,626 --> 01:14:15,187
I've been well paid and I've done
dirty work for it...

835
01:14:15,347 --> 01:14:18,181
but this was murder and she is
an English woman.

836
01:14:18,348 --> 01:14:20,863
- You are Bandrieken.
- My husband was, but I'm English.

837
01:14:21,029 --> 01:14:23,066
You were going to butcher
her in cold blood.

838
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:27,703
Your little diversion made it necessary
not only to remove the lady...

839
01:14:27,872 --> 01:14:29,225
but two others as well.

840
01:14:29,432 --> 01:14:30,946
You can' t do that.

841
01:14:31,393 --> 01:14:36,708
It'd be fool to permit the existence
of anyone who cannot be trusted.

842
01:14:37,115 --> 01:14:40,791
- You wouldn't dare. I know too much.
- Precisely.

843
01:14:46,198 --> 01:14:47,951
I think we're over
the border now.

844
01:14:49,399 --> 01:14:50,958
You can come out, Miss Froy.

845
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,837
- Bless me. What an unpleasant journey.
- Never mind.

846
01:14:55,001 --> 01:14:58,279
You shall have a corner seat for the
rest of the way. There you are.

847
01:14:58,963 --> 01:15:01,762
Now that it's over, you ought
to tell us what it's all about.

848
01:15:03,404 --> 01:15:04,474
What was that scream?

849
01:15:04,645 --> 01:15:06,921
- It was the train whistle.
- It was the woman.

850
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,280
Be careful.

851
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:20,365
We're on a branch line and they've
slipped the rear of the train.

852
01:15:20,531 --> 01:15:21,759
Oh dear!

853
01:15:21,931 --> 01:15:24,446
Why are these people going
to these lengths to get hold of you?

854
01:15:24,612 --> 01:15:27,571
I haven't the faintest idea.
I'm a children's governess...

855
01:15:27,733 --> 01:15:29,292
I think they've made
some terrible mistake.

856
01:15:29,454 --> 01:15:31,571
Why are holding out on us?
Tell the truth.

857
01:15:31,735 --> 01:15:34,728
You got us involved in this fantastic
plot you might at least trust us.

858
01:15:35,016 --> 01:15:36,575
I really don't know...

859
01:15:38,097 --> 01:15:40,487
- Is there anyone else?
- There's only the dining cart...

860
01:15:40,658 --> 01:15:42,729
but there won't be
anybody there now.

861
01:15:42,939 --> 01:15:47,252
What do you make it, tea time?
I'll go have a look.

862
01:15:48,621 --> 01:15:50,260
Come on.
We'd better stick together.

863
01:15:57,224 --> 01:15:59,261
There's the old girl
turned up.

864
01:16:00,825 --> 01:16:04,183
Told you there was lots of fuss about
nothing. Bolt must have jammed.

865
01:16:05,787 --> 01:16:07,619
I've got something to say.
Please listen.

866
01:16:08,308 --> 01:16:10,664
An attempt has been made
to abduct this lady by force.

867
01:16:10,829 --> 01:16:13,185
I believe they are
going to try again.

868
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:14,988
What's the fellow
drivelling about?

869
01:16:15,151 --> 01:16:18,303
Look out of the window. This train's
been diverted to a branch line.

870
01:16:18,472 --> 01:16:21,306
What are you talking about?
Abduction, diverted trains...

871
01:16:21,473 --> 01:16:23,829
- We're telling the truth.
- I'm not interested.

872
01:16:23,994 --> 01:16:26,031
You've annoyed us long enough
with your ridiculous stories.

873
01:16:26,195 --> 01:16:28,504
You've got hold of
the wrong end of the stick.

874
01:16:28,675 --> 01:16:32,147
- These things don't happen.
- We're not in England now.

875
01:16:32,317 --> 01:16:35,151
- I don't see the difference.
- We're stopping.

876
01:16:38,039 --> 01:16:41,112
You see those cars? They're
here to take Miss Froy away.

877
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,475
Nonsense.

878
01:16:43,281 --> 01:16:45,078
There go a couple of people.

879
01:16:46,882 --> 01:16:48,475
The cars have come
to pick them up.

880
01:16:48,643 --> 01:16:51,112
Then why uncoupling
the train and diverting it.

881
01:16:51,284 --> 01:16:52,114
Uncoupling?

882
01:16:52,284 --> 01:16:53,923
There's no train
beyond the sleeping car.

883
01:16:54,085 --> 01:16:55,962
There must be. Our bags are
in the First Class carriage.

884
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:58,435
Not any longer.
Would you like to take a look?

885
01:16:58,686 --> 01:17:01,599
If this is a practical joke, I warn
you I shan't think it very funny.

886
01:17:04,288 --> 01:17:05,563
Good Lord!

887
01:17:12,411 --> 01:17:13,242
Bring some brandy.

888
01:17:13,412 --> 01:17:16,564
You don't suppose there's something
in this fellow's story, Caldicott.

889
01:17:16,733 --> 01:17:20,090
- Seems a bit queer.
- People don't go about tying up nuns.

890
01:17:26,136 --> 01:17:27,331
Someone's coming.

891
01:17:32,859 --> 01:17:35,010
They can't possibly do anything
to us. We're British subjects.

892
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:51,219
I have come
to offer sincere apologies.

893
01:17:51,386 --> 01:17:53,616
An extremely serious
incident has occurred.

894
01:17:53,786 --> 01:17:57,337
An attempt has been made to interfere
with passengers on this train.

895
01:17:57,828 --> 01:18:00,423
Fortunately it was brought
to the notice of the authorities.

896
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:03,702
If you will accompany me
to Morsken...

897
01:18:03,870 --> 01:18:05,907
I will inform the British
Embassy at once.

898
01:18:06,071 --> 01:18:08,302
Ladies and Gentlemen,
the cars are at your disposal.

899
01:18:09,752 --> 01:18:12,586
We're grateful. It's lucky
some of you speak English.

900
01:18:12,753 --> 01:18:15,871
- I was at Oxford.
- Really, so was I.

901
01:18:16,235 --> 01:18:18,226
This woman is trying
to say something.

902
01:18:18,395 --> 01:18:20,034
I don't understand
but it may be important.

903
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:21,869
- Would you...
- Certainly.

904
01:18:25,518 --> 01:18:28,113
- That's fixed him.
- That's all right. He's only stunned.

905
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:31,198
- What did you to that for?
- I was at Cambridge.

906
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,079
But you heard
what he said, didn't you?

907
01:18:33,361 --> 01:18:35,637
I heard what she said. That was
a trick to get us off the train.

908
01:18:35,802 --> 01:18:38,363
I don't believe it. The explanation
was quite satisfactory.

909
01:18:38,683 --> 01:18:40,162
This might cause a war.

910
01:18:44,605 --> 01:18:48,235
I'm going to tell them it's up to us
to apologise and put the matter right.

911
01:19:09,774 --> 01:19:12,448
- You were right. Do you mind?
- Certainly.

912
01:19:15,936 --> 01:19:17,655
Looks as if they mean business.

913
01:19:17,817 --> 01:19:19,649
It would mean
an international situation.

914
01:19:19,818 --> 01:19:21,046
It's happened before.

915
01:19:23,019 --> 01:19:26,137
- They're coming.
- Don't let them in. They'll murder us.

916
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:27,893
They daren't let us go now.

917
01:19:38,504 --> 01:19:41,065
- I order you to surrender at once.
- Nothing doing.

918
01:19:41,225 --> 01:19:44,742
- lf you come any nearer I'll fire.
- I've warned you.

919
01:19:47,588 --> 01:19:49,579
Better take cover.
They'll start any minute now.

920
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:56,500
- Nasty jam. Don't like the look of it.
- Got plenty of ammunition.

921
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,946
- Whole pouch full.
- Good.

922
01:19:58,112 --> 01:20:00,707
- Duck down, you.
- I'm not going to fight. It's madness.

923
01:20:00,873 --> 01:20:02,829
It's safer to protest down here.

924
01:20:07,955 --> 01:20:09,708
They're trying to work
round to the other side.

925
01:20:09,996 --> 01:20:11,429
You're behaving
like a pack of fools.

926
01:20:11,597 --> 01:20:13,747
What chance have we got
against those armed men?

927
01:20:13,917 --> 01:20:15,431
You heard what the
Mother Superior said.

928
01:20:15,598 --> 01:20:17,476
If we surrender now,
we're in for it.

929
01:20:34,765 --> 01:20:36,882
We'll never get to
the match now.

930
01:20:37,246 --> 01:20:39,522
Give it to me.
Give it to me.

931
01:20:41,848 --> 01:20:44,841
- What's going on here?
- He's got a gun and he won't use it.

932
01:20:45,609 --> 01:20:48,522
I won't be a party to this sort
of thing. I don't believe in fighting.

933
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:52,240
Pacifist? Won't work. Christians
tried it and got thrown to the lions.

934
01:20:52,411 --> 01:20:53,686
Come on, hand it over.

935
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:59,165
I'm not afraid to use it.

936
01:20:59,374 --> 01:21:03,084
Probably more used to it.
I once won a box of cigars.

937
01:21:03,856 --> 01:21:05,448
He's talking rot.
He's a good shot.

938
01:21:07,457 --> 01:21:10,291
Hope the old hand hasn't lost it's
cunning. I'm inclined to believe...

939
01:21:10,978 --> 01:21:13,368
that there's some
rational explanation to all this.

940
01:21:14,419 --> 01:21:16,490
Rotten shot,
only knocked his head off.

941
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:19,372
Would you mind if we talk
for a minute?

942
01:21:20,582 --> 01:21:24,337
- What, now?
- Please, it's very important.

943
01:21:25,864 --> 01:21:28,663
- Hang on to this for me, will you?
- All right. I'll hold the fort.

944
01:21:28,825 --> 01:21:31,898
It's safer along here.
You come in too.

945
01:21:39,709 --> 01:21:42,622
I just wanted to tell you that
I must be getting along now.

946
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:44,906
You'll never get away.
You'll be shot down.

947
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:46,709
I must take the risk.

948
01:21:46,871 --> 01:21:51,993
If I'm unlucky and you get
through, take back a message...

949
01:21:52,153 --> 01:21:54,065
to Mr. Callendar
at the Foreign Office.

950
01:21:54,234 --> 01:21:56,829
- Then you are a spy.
- I think that is such a grim word.

951
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:58,428
What is the message?

952
01:21:59,116 --> 01:22:02,234
It's a tune.
It contains, in code...

953
01:22:02,397 --> 01:22:05,276
the vital clause of a secret pact
between two European countries.

954
01:22:05,438 --> 01:22:08,909
I want you to memorise it.
The first part goes like this...

955
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,552
I'd better write it down.
Let me a piece of paper.

956
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:16,792
I was brought up on music.
I can memorise anything.

957
01:22:16,962 --> 01:22:17,872
Very well.

958
01:22:20,283 --> 01:22:21,763
The old girl's
gone off her rocker.

959
01:22:21,924 --> 01:22:26,077
Face it, those swines will go on
firing till they kill us all.

960
01:22:26,245 --> 01:22:27,838
For goodness sake,
shut up, Eric.

961
01:22:29,327 --> 01:22:31,522
Now we've got
two chances instead of one.

962
01:22:32,408 --> 01:22:34,798
- You're sure you'll remember it?
- I won't stop whistling it.

963
01:22:35,329 --> 01:22:37,719
- I suppose this is my best way out?
- Yes, just about.

964
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:41,723
But even if you do get away
they'll stop you at the frontier.

965
01:22:41,891 --> 01:22:44,531
- We can't let her go.
- You're taking a big risk.

966
01:22:44,692 --> 01:22:47,127
In this sort of job one
must take risks.

967
01:22:47,493 --> 01:22:50,133
I'm grateful to you both
for all you've done.

968
01:22:50,294 --> 01:22:52,570
I do hope and pray no harm
will come to you...

969
01:22:52,735 --> 01:22:55,409
and that we shall
all meet again.

970
01:22:55,576 --> 01:22:58,535
- I hope so too. Good luck.
- Good luck.

971
01:23:00,338 --> 01:23:02,056
- Will you help me out?
- Yes, rather.

972
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:09,455
Take the weight, on top,
right you are, I've got you.

973
01:23:12,862 --> 01:23:14,012
Goodbye.

974
01:23:27,588 --> 01:23:29,385
- Was she hit?
- I'm not sure.

975
01:23:35,671 --> 01:23:39,142
- That's the end of my twelve.
- There's not much left here, either.

976
01:23:40,833 --> 01:23:43,826
We've only got one chance.
We've got to get this train going.

977
01:23:43,994 --> 01:23:45,950
Go back to the main line and
try and cross the frontier.

978
01:23:46,114 --> 01:23:47,594
That's a bit of a tall order.

979
01:23:47,755 --> 01:23:50,224
Those drivers are not
likely to do as you tell them.

980
01:23:51,236 --> 01:23:52,795
We'll bluff them with this.
Who's coming?

981
01:23:52,957 --> 01:23:54,356
- You can count on me.
- Me too.

982
01:23:54,798 --> 01:23:56,789
We can't all go.
You stay here...

983
01:23:56,958 --> 01:23:59,189
If we have any luck we'll stop
the train at the point...

984
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:01,590
- and you switch them over.
- Okay.

985
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,480
You idiots, you're just
inviting death.

986
01:24:09,523 --> 01:24:10,923
I've had enough.

987
01:24:11,084 --> 01:24:13,200
Just because I try and avoid
being murdered...

988
01:24:13,364 --> 01:24:18,315
I'm accused of pacifist. I'd rather
be called a rat than die like one.

989
01:24:18,846 --> 01:24:22,397
If we give ourselves up, they
daren't murder us in cold blood.

990
01:24:22,568 --> 01:24:24,365
- They're bound to give us a trial.
- Stop gibbering.

991
01:24:24,528 --> 01:24:29,046
- Nobody's listening to you.
- You go your way, I'll go mine.

992
01:24:29,210 --> 01:24:32,408
- Where are you off to?
- I'm doing the only sensible thing.

993
01:24:32,571 --> 01:24:33,971
Let him go if he wants to.

994
01:25:03,503 --> 01:25:08,180
Don't please. Why aren't we going?
Why aren't we going?

995
01:25:08,424 --> 01:25:10,302
They said we were going.
Why aren't we?

996
01:25:10,465 --> 01:25:12,297
If only he can get us
away now. He must.

997
01:25:12,466 --> 01:25:14,776
Only one left.
I'll keep that for a sitter.

998
01:25:16,267 --> 01:25:18,577
They're moving away from the cars.
They're coming towards us.

999
01:25:20,389 --> 01:25:23,666
- Pity we haven't a few more rounds.
- It's funny.

1000
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:27,790
I told my husband when I left
him that I wouldn't see him again.

1001
01:25:28,152 --> 01:25:30,427
Gilbert! Gilbert!

1002
01:25:38,956 --> 01:25:41,345
- By gad, we're off.
- This gives us a chance.

1003
01:25:49,239 --> 01:25:51,196
Come on, keep going.

1004
01:26:02,364 --> 01:26:05,437
- Do you know how to control this?
- I watched the fellow start it.

1005
01:26:05,605 --> 01:26:08,962
I know something. Once drove
a miniature engine in Dymchurch.

1006
01:26:09,126 --> 01:26:10,958
Good. I'll look out
for the points.

1007
01:26:17,009 --> 01:26:18,409
Blighters are chasing us.
Look.

1008
01:26:22,811 --> 01:26:24,040
We can't have far to go.

1009
01:26:30,734 --> 01:26:32,646
It's time for me
to change the points.

1010
01:26:32,975 --> 01:26:34,807
We shall be in neutral territory.

1011
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:37,127
That's not necessary.

1012
01:26:39,257 --> 01:26:42,968
The points will not be
changed over.

1013
01:26:43,819 --> 01:26:45,219
Please be seated.

1014
01:26:53,423 --> 01:26:55,984
There they are, just ahead of us.
Do you think you can stop it?

1015
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:57,293
Hope so.

1016
01:27:00,545 --> 01:27:02,741
You'll keep quite still until
my friends arrive.

1017
01:27:02,906 --> 01:27:05,546
If anyone leaves,
I shall have to shoot.

1018
01:27:05,707 --> 01:27:07,539
There's one thing
you don't know.

1019
01:27:07,708 --> 01:27:11,224
There's only one bullet left, if you
shoot me the others have a chance.

1020
01:27:12,229 --> 01:27:16,782
- You're in a difficult position.
- Sit down please.

1021
01:27:18,592 --> 01:27:19,786
All right.

1022
01:27:24,314 --> 01:27:25,986
Where the devil's Charters?

1023
01:27:37,399 --> 01:27:39,230
Go ahead, she's done it.

1024
01:27:51,204 --> 01:27:53,081
It's all right, it's just my legs.

1025
01:28:11,131 --> 01:28:13,851
Or as they say in English,
jolly good luck to them.

1026
01:28:15,092 --> 01:28:20,122
I'm glad that's over. Heaven knows
what the government will say about it.

1027
01:28:20,294 --> 01:28:22,809
- Nothing at all. They'll hush it up.
- What?

1028
01:28:24,736 --> 01:28:27,331
Take your hand off that thing.
I've got to remember a tune.

1029
01:28:27,497 --> 01:28:28,646
Remember...

1030
01:28:45,423 --> 01:28:47,062
- Porter, sir?
- No, thanks.

1031
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:49,344
We're home, Gilbert.

1032
01:28:50,505 --> 01:28:53,100
Stop humming that awful tune.
You must know it backwards.

1033
01:28:53,266 --> 01:28:54,746
I'm not taking any risks.

1034
01:28:56,427 --> 01:29:00,058
- Charles will be here to meet you?
- I expect so.

1035
01:29:01,509 --> 01:29:03,182
You'll be pretty busy
between now and Thursday.

1036
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:06,024
I could meet you for lunch
or dinner, if you'd like it.

1037
01:29:06,471 --> 01:29:08,190
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

1038
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:11,151
I've got to deliver this theme
song to Miss Froy...

1039
01:29:11,313 --> 01:29:13,953
and then I'm going to Yorkshire
and finish my book.

1040
01:29:14,714 --> 01:29:15,863
I see.

1041
01:29:16,715 --> 01:29:18,273
- Ready?
- Yes.

1042
01:29:28,759 --> 01:29:31,672
Ample time to catch the 6:50
to Manchester after all.

1043
01:29:34,441 --> 01:29:37,081
TEST MATCH ABANDONED
FLOODS

1044
01:29:43,845 --> 01:29:46,679
- Any sign of Charles yet?
- No, I can't see him.

1045
01:29:48,206 --> 01:29:50,675
Well, this is where
we say goodbye.

1046
01:29:56,569 --> 01:29:57,889
What's the matter?

1047
01:30:05,092 --> 01:30:06,287
Charles?

1048
01:30:06,453 --> 01:30:10,049
Yes, you heartless, callous, selfish,
swollen-headed beast...

1049
01:30:14,176 --> 01:30:16,610
- Are you going anywhere?
- Foreign Office.

1050
01:30:22,819 --> 01:30:25,573
- Where are we going on our honeymoon?
- Somewhere quiet.

1051
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:27,696
Somewhere where
there are no trains.

1052
01:30:28,021 --> 01:30:29,693
Mr. Callendar will
see you now.

1053
01:30:33,823 --> 01:30:36,384
- Wait a minute. It's gone!
- What's gone?

1054
01:30:36,544 --> 01:30:38,296
- The tune. I've forgotten it!
- No! No!

1055
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:40,535
Wait a minute.
Let me concentrate.

1056
01:30:42,746 --> 01:30:44,783
No, that's
the Wedding March.

1057
01:30:46,227 --> 01:30:49,300
It's awful. I've done nothing
but sing it since that day.

1058
01:30:49,949 --> 01:30:51,701
Now I've forgotten
it completely.

1059
01:31:13,157 --> 01:31:15,718
- Miss Froy!
- Well, I'll be hanged.
