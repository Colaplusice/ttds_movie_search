{16429}{16485}A very important secret|for this country.

{17991}{18070}l'd hoped l'd shaken them off.
{18072}{18162}l'm going to tell you something|which is not very healthy to know.

{18284}{18328}How do you mean?
{18330}{18417}- Have you ever heard of the 39 Steps?|- No. What's that, a pub?
{18448}{18488}Never mind.
{18491}{18604}But what you were laughing at is true.|These men will stop at nothing.
{18606}{18663}l'm the only person|who can stop them.
{18665}{18747}lf they are not stopped, it's only|a matter of days, perhaps hours..
{18749}{18828}- before the secret is out.|- Why don't you phone the police?
{18830}{18912}Because they wouldn't believe me|any more than you did.
{18914}{19000}lf they did, how long do you think|it would take to get them going?
{19004}{19053}These men act quickly.
{19057}{19121}You don't know|how clever their chief is.
{19123}{19210}- Clever and ruthless.|- Who is he? What's his name?
{19213}{19310}He has a dozen names and|he can look like a hundred people.
{19312}{19415}But one thing he cannot disguise:|this.
{19418}{19462}Part of his little finger is missing.
{19464}{19546}lf ever you should meet a man|with no top joint there..
{19548}{19645}- be very careful, my friend.|- Thanks. l'll make a note of it.
{19648}{19697}Meanwhile, what are you going to do?
{19699}{19743}First, l'll eat my haddock..
{19745}{19833}then, if you are not going to|turn me out onto the street..
{19835}{19913}- have a good night's rest.|- You're welcome to my bed.
{19915}{19982}l'll get a shakedown|on the couch.
{19984}{20039}Anything else l can get you?
{20041}{20120}- A map of Scotland.|- Why Scotland?
{20123}{20221}There's a man in Scotland whom l must|visit next if anything is to be done.
{20295}{20389}Are the 39 Steps in Scotland,|by any chance?
{20392}{20444}Perhaps l'll tell you tomorrow.
{20829}{20927}Clear out, Hannay.|They'll get you next.
{22008}{22124}What you were laughing at|just now is true.
{22169}{22243}These men will stop at nothing.
{23061}{23131}There's a man in Scotland..
{23134}{23227}whom l must visit next|if anything is to be done.
{23266}{23385}lt is only a matter of days,|perhaps hours..
{23388}{23461}before the secret|is out of the country.

{23641}{23723}l tell you,|these men act quickly.
{23756}{23823}Quickly. Quickly.

{25721}{25788}They've murdered a woman in my flat,|and now they're waiting for me.
{25790}{25847}Come off it. Funny jokes|at 5:00 in the morning.

{26283}{26346}- Now l want to go home.|- What's preventing you?
{26348}{26431}One of those men is her brother,|the other's her husband. Now do you see?
{26434}{26513}Why didn't you tell me before?|l only wanted to be told.
{26515}{26580}Trying to keep me with tales|about murders and foreigners.
{26582}{26644}Here, put this on.|Put on my hat. There you are.
{26647}{26705}- Take the pound.|- No, sir, you're welcome to it.

{40501}{40570}- Two and six.|- Take it now. Thank you.
{40612}{40709}Go in with the gentleman. He'll stay|with us till tomorrow morning.
{40711}{40805}- Your daughter?|- My wife.
{40946}{41001}- Will you now come in?|- Thank you.
{41206}{41250}Here's your bed.
{41253}{41298}l'll lift these things.
{41341}{41411}- Could you sleep there?|- You try and stop me.
{41413}{41456}You'll be tired.
{41496}{41536}l'll say l am.
{41538}{41591}l'm on the tramp,|looking for a job.
{41594}{41653}Won't you sit down|while l go on with our supper?
{41656}{41697}Thank you.
{42158}{42276}- Have you been in these parts long?|- No, l'm from Glasgow.
{42278}{42327}- Did you ever see it?|- No.
{42329}{42420}You should see Sauchiohall Street|with all its fine shops..
{42422}{42489}and Argyll Street|on a Saturday night..
{42491}{42542}with the trams|and the lights..
{42545}{42616}and the cinema palaces|and their crowds.
{42619}{42664}And it's Saturday night tonight.
{42666}{42722}You certainly don't get|those things out here.
{42725}{42769}No.
{42849}{42902}You miss them?
{42905}{42949}Sometimes.
{42951}{42995}l've never been to Glasgow,|but l've been to Edinburgh..
{42997}{43046}and Montreal and London.
{43048}{43105}l'll tell you all about London|at supper.
{43108}{43181}- John wouldn't approve of that.|- Why not?
{43184}{43283}He says it's best not to think of|such places and the wickedness there.
{43285}{43354}Why not listen now|before he comes back?
{43356}{43403}What do you want to know?
{43433}{43505}ls it true that all the ladies|paint their toenails?
{43508}{43538}Some of them.
{43541}{43608}- Do London ladies look beautiful?|- They do.
{43611}{43666}But they wouldn't|if you were beside them.
{43669}{43761}- You ought not say that.|- What ought he not to say?
{43764}{43880}l was saying l prefer living in town|than the country.
{43883}{43926}God made the country.
{44041}{44097}- ls the supper ready, woman?|- Aye.
{44100}{44162}- Do you mind if l look at your paper?|- l don't mind.
{44164}{44208}Thank you.
{44595}{44681}- You did not tell me your name.|- Hammond.
{44684}{44770}Well, Mr. Hammond, if you'll put down|that paper, l'll say a blessing.
{44773}{44817}Of course.
{44912}{45010}Sanctify these bounteous masses|to us miserable sinners.
{45043}{45092}O Lord,|make us truly thankful..
{45094}{45193}for them and for all|Thy manifold blessings.
{45195}{45250}Continually turn our hearts..
{45252}{45295}from wickedness..
{45327}{45388}and from worldly things..
{45392}{45434}unto Thee.
{45511}{45555}Amen.
{45677}{45724}l forgot to lock the barn.
{47596}{47662}There are cars coming. lt'll be|the police. You best be going.
{47664}{47723}- Thank you. l was having a grand sleep.|- Don't let them catch you.
{47726}{47781}All right. l'll never forget you|for doing this for me.
{47783}{47827}- Which way do l go?|- l'll show you.
{47829}{47922}Aye. l might have known.
{47925}{47984}Making love behind my back.
{48051}{48104}- Get out. You too.|- Just a minute--
{48107}{48157}- Get out of my house before l--|- Aye. Go.
{48159}{48212}- And leave you like this?|- lt's your chance at liberty.
{48215}{48304}You don't understand.
{48306}{48359}You're all wrong about this.|She was only trying to help me.
{48361}{48405}Aye, to bring shame and disgrace|upon my house.
{48408}{48467}She was helping me to|escape from the police.
{48469}{48521}- The police?|- Yes, they're after me for murder.
{48523}{48555}- What?|- They're here.
{48557}{48635}She was only warning me.|l had to tell her last night.
{48637}{48712}Don't let them in. Say l'm not here.|l'll make it worth your while.
{48714}{48743}- How much?|- Five pounds.
{48746}{48789}Have you got that much?|Give it to me.
{48791}{48842}After they've gone.
{48845}{48904}Get back into bed.|Shut him in. Hide him.
{48963}{49023}- Not there. l do not trust him.|- But he took the money.
{49025}{49075}He could not resist it.|Here.
{49173}{49213}Have you seen a stranger|about here?
{49216}{49269}What kind of a stranger?
{49271}{49315}l was right.
{49318}{49407}He's asking if there's a reward|if you get catched.
{49410}{49468}He'll argue about it for a moment|longer before he lets them in.
{49470}{49538}Now's your time. Your|jacket's terrible light-colored.
{49541}{49606}l'm a-feared they'll see you.
{49609}{49664}- You best take this one.|- ls this your husband's coat?
{49667}{49742}His son's, but never mind.|They must not see you.
{49744}{49795}- What will happen to you?|- l'll say l couldn't stop you.
{49797}{49852}- He'll not ill treat you?|- He'll pray at me, but no more.
{49855}{49894}- What's your name?|- Margaret.
{49897}{49956}Good-bye, Margaret.|l'll never forget you for this.
{50589}{50623}There he goes!
{50807}{50837}Spread out in a line.
{52912}{52962}- ls the master in?|- What name should l say, sir?
{52965}{53021}He wouldn't know my name.|Ask if he knows Miss Annabella Smith.
{53024}{53084}- Would you wait here while l inquire?|- Yes. Go on.
{53270}{53314}We'd better make inquiries here.
{53316}{53366}Somebody may have seen him|through the windows.
{53368}{53424}- There's been a couple motorcars here.|- Aye.
{53426}{53496}Murderers do not make calls|in motorcars.
{53498}{53542}- Good day, dear.|- The same to you.
{53544}{53598}Have you seen any strangers|this morning?
{53601}{53666}There's a few callers upstairs now,|but they're not strangers.
{53668}{53742}You haven't seen any suspicious-looking|bodies outside the windows..
{53745}{53802}- or calling at the house?|- No, sir.
{53804}{53894}There hasn't been anybody near here|for the last half hour.
{53927}{53999}- You're from Annabella Smith?|- Yes.
{54003}{54076}We're just having a few drinks|to celebrate my daughter's birthday.
{54079}{54133}Give me five minutes,|then we can talk.
{54135}{54191}- Of course.|- Come meet my wife. Louisa, my dear.
{54193}{54250}l've another guest for you.|This is Mr.--
{54252}{54314}- l forgot to ask your name.|- Hammond.
{54317}{54379}He's come to see me on business,|all the way from London.
{54381}{54444}There's a police inspector at|the door. He wants to speak to you.
{54446}{54490}At the door?
{54530}{54585}All right.|l'll deal with it.
{54587}{54641}- Take him in, my dear.|- Come and meet my daughters.
{54643}{54704}- This is Patricia.|- How do you do?
{54707}{54755}Mrs. Bailey. Mrs. Hutchins.
{54758}{54838}Hilary, my dear,|this is Mr. Hammond.
{54841}{54894}- He just arrived from London.|- How do you do?
{54896}{54980}Forgive the orgy. We've been to church|and the sermon lasted 45 minutes.
{54982}{55042}- This is Captain and Mrs. Ogilvey.|- How do you do?
{55046}{55076}- Have a drink?|- Thank you.
{55079}{55145}This is Derek Stewart.
{55147}{55215}And this is Sheriff Watson.|You've got to be polite to him.
{55217}{55284}He's our Sheriff Substitute.|Scotch for a local beak.
{55286}{55352}He'll give you six months hard|as soon as look at you.
{55404}{55477}lt's all right. Don't worry.|l've sent them away.
{55480}{55539}Come and look at the view|from this window.
{55601}{55650}We're rather proud of it.
{55766}{55842}- When will you catch that murderer?|- What murderer?
{55844}{55945}The man that stuck a carving knife|into that woman last week.
{55947}{56004}- He's here in the district.|- How exciting. Where?
{56006}{56084}Somewhere about.|He's been on the moors.
{56088}{56136}Sheriff Ames, why don't you catch him?
{56139}{56195}You wouldn't like me to be stuck|in the back with a carving knife.
{56197}{56266}lt's no business of mine to catch him.|You catch him, and l'll convict him.
{56269}{56361}- ls there a reward?|- lt's nearly 1 :00. We must leave.
{56363}{56412}- The professor wants his lunch.|- There's no hurry, my dear.
{56415}{56512}Still, if you must go--|Pat, ring for Captain Ogilvey's car.
{56515}{56569}Yes, sir.
{56572}{56615}Are you coming out?
{56618}{56662}Come show us your new car.
{56709}{56754}- Come again another time.|- Good-bye. We'd love to.
{56757}{56831}Whenever you catch him, you'll find me|at the Sherif Court every morning.
{56833}{56882}- Bring him along.|- Good-bye.
{56947}{56998}Louisa, if you'll excuse us..
{57001}{57096}Mr. Hammond and l want|to have a chat before lunch.
{57252}{57383}Now, Mr. Hannay-- l suppose it's safe|to call you by your real name now.
{57386}{57445}What about our mutual friend,|Annabella?
{57449}{57525}- She's been murdered.|- ''Murdered''?
{57528}{57576}The Portland Mansions affair.
{57579}{57622}Why our friends outside|are looking for you.
{57624}{57672}- l didn't do it.|- Of course you didn't.
{57705}{57762}But why come all this way|to Scotland to tell me?
{57765}{57844}l believe she was coming to see you|about some Air Ministry secret.
{57847}{57937}She was killed by a foreign agent|who was interested too.
{57939}{58004}- Did she tell you what he looked like?|- There wasn't time.
{58007}{58059}One thing: Part of his|little finger was missing.
{58061}{58118}- Which one?|- This one, l think.
{58121}{58169}Sure it wasn't this one?
{58659}{58740}- Lunch is ready, dear.|- l'm coming right away.
{58783}{58911}l've been guilty of leading you|down the garden path.
{58914}{58966}Or should it be up?|l never can remember.
{58968}{59043}lt seems to be the wrong garden,|all right.
{59080}{59121}Well.
{59124}{59188}- What are we going to do?|- That's just the point.
{59191}{59254}What are we going|to do about it?
{59256}{59335}l live here|as a respectable citizen.
{59337}{59410}You must realize that my whole|existence would be jeopardized..
{59412}{59519}if it became known that|l'm not what l seem.
{59522}{59611}Mr. Hannay,|why have you come here?
{59613}{59675}Why have you forced me|into this difficult position?
{59678}{59762}l can't lock you up in a room|or anything like that.
{59765}{59835}There's my wife and daughters|to think of.
{59838}{59902}l don't know what to think.|Really, l don't.
{59936}{60012}Making it doubly important|that l shouldn't let you go is..
{60014}{60131}l'm about to convey some very vital|information out of the country.
{60133}{60186}Yes, l've got it.
{60219}{60295}Poor Annabella|would have been too late.
{60394}{60457}- That's fair.|- Yes. What about it?
{60459}{60504}- What about what?|- Yourself.
{60508}{60575}- lt seems there's only one way out.|- What's that?
{60673}{60780}Supposing l left you alone|with this revolver?
{60782}{60861}Tomorrow's newspapers would announce|that the Portland Place murderer..
{60865}{60941}- had taken his own life.|- l thought you were coming directly.
{60943}{60981}We've all been waiting.
{60983}{61050}- Will Mr. Hammond be staying?|- l don't think so, dear.
{61086}{61166}Well, what do you think,|Mr. Hannay?
{61357}{61420}l'm afraid|you leave me no alternative.
{61591}{61653}l cannot find my hymn book.
{61655}{61722}- Where did you leave it?|- ln the breast pocket of my overcoat.
{61725}{61793}lt was hanging here.
{61795}{61918}l'm afraid l gave it to that gentleman|who was staying here that night.
{62084}{62162}Cigarette cases, yes, but l've never|seen it happen to a hymn book before.
{62164}{62220}And this bullet stuck|among the hymns, eh?
{62224}{62319}l'm not surprised. Some of those hymns|are terrible hard to get through.
{62322}{62380}l've stuck in them myself|before now.
{62382}{62444}l'm not complaining, Sheriff.|''Hymns that have helped me.''
{62446}{62515}That's a good one!|That's fine.
{62518}{62606}And to think l was drinking his|champagne only half an hour before.
{62608}{62710}lt's a lesson to us all: not to mix|with doubtful company on the Sabbath.
{62713}{62756}And how did you escape?
{62759}{62805}lf you look through the window,|you'll see.
{62808}{62864}They put the body|in the dressing room.
{62866}{62981}When l came to, l borrowed this suit|and pinched his car.
{63014}{63083}l don't want to hurry you,|but shouldn't we take steps?
{63086}{63159}This is serious. Otherwise, l wouldn't|put myself in your hands..
{63162}{63252}- with a murder charge hanging over me.|- Never heed the murder.
{63254}{63312}You'll be able to convince|Scotland Yard of your innocence..
{63315}{63359}as easily|as you've convinced me.
{63361}{63468}l'll need a short statement l can|forward to the proper authority.
{63471}{63527}l have someone coming|from the police station to take it down.
{63529}{63582}Thank you.
{63612}{63669}- Are you wishing to see me?|- lndeed, l am.
{63672}{63761}Do you think l enjoy playing for time|with a murderer?
{63763}{63808}- ''Murderer''?|- Certainly.
{63810}{63887}You're under arrest on the charge|of willful murder..
{63889}{63963}of a woman unknown in Portland|Mansions, London on Tuesday last.
{63966}{64050}- Take him over to the county jail.|- Every word of my story is true.
{64052}{64142}We are not so daft in Scotland|as some smart Londoners may think.
{64145}{64208}Do you think l believed your|cock-and-bull story about the professor?
{64210}{64267}He's my best friend in the district.|Get me Professor Jordan.
{64269}{64316}lf the professor didn't shoot me,|where did that bullet come from?
{64318}{64374}That's easy. From one of|your pursuers on the moor.
{64377}{64430}- lsn't that so, lnspector?|- l had a shot at him myself.
{64433}{64494}l demand you allow me to telephone the|High Commissioner for Canada in London.
{64496}{64543}You better do that from London.|You'll be there soon enough.
{64546}{64601}lt'll save you the cost|of a trunk call.
{64779}{64827}That's the professor's car.
{64830}{64883}Hannay must be inside|spilling the beans.
{64950}{65007}- Stop him!|- My God!
{66202}{66267}How do you do?|We're all waiting for you.
{66269}{66342}Pamela's gone to meet you|at the station. This way.
{66368}{66453}Leader and standard-bearer himself.
{66455}{66533}l welcome this opportunity|of discussing with you..
{66536}{66638}another question vital|to the import of our country..
{66642}{66710}at this critical|and momentous hour.
{66713}{66785}But first of all,|as a preliminary to this..
{66788}{66882}- l shall occupy your time--|- You've occupied too much time already!
{66884}{66932}We've had enough of you!
{67067}{67158}Ladies and gentlemen, l'm now going to|call upon the speaker of the evening.
{67162}{67230}- Speak up!|- There's no need to say who he is..
{67233}{67316}or to speak of his brilliant record|as a soldier and a statesman.
{67319}{67392}He's a son of Scotland who has crossed|the border and conquered England.
{67395}{67441}He is now one|of the foremost figures..
{67444}{67515}in the diplomatic political world|in the great city of London.
{67518}{67584}l'm, therefore, going to ask him|to tell you something--
{67586}{67644}- lt's about time too.|- How important it is..
{67647}{67733}to this constituency|that at this crucial by-election..
{67736}{67829}our candidate should be returned|by an adequate majority.
{67831}{67902}l now ask for Captain Fraser.
{68316}{68402}Ladies and gentlemen, l apologize for|my hesitation in rising just now..
{68404}{68471}but l'd entirely|failed while listening..
{68473}{68547}to the chairman's flattering|description of the next speaker..
{68550}{68605}to realize he was|talking about me.
{68662}{68731}As for you, may l say|from the bottom of my heart..
{68733}{68777}and with the utmost sincerity..
{68780}{68841}how delighted and relieved l am|to find myself..
{68843}{68888}in your presence at this moment.
{69032}{69093}Delighted because|of your friendly reception..
{69095}{69184}relieved because so long|as l stand on this platform..
{69187}{69293}l am delivered from the cares|and anxieties..
{69296}{69372}which must always be the lot|of a man in my position.
{69375}{69432}When l journeyed up to Scotland|a few days ago..
{69434}{69526}traveling on the Highland Express|over that magnificent Forth Bridge..
{69529}{69610}that monument to Scottish engineering|and Scottish muscle--
{69655}{69719}That is to say, on that journey l|had no idea that in a few days time..
{69721}{69799}l should find myself addressing|an important political meeting.
{69802}{69864}l had planned a very different program|for myself.
{69866}{69923}A very different program.
{69926}{69966}You'd be for the moors|to shoot something.
{69968}{70014}Or somebody.|l'm a rotten shot.
{70049}{70107}Anyhow, l little thought|l should be speaking tonight..
{70110}{70180}in support of that brilliant,|young statesman.
{70183}{70221}That rising--
{70223}{70277}The gentleman on my right..
{70280}{70343}already known among you|as one destined to make..
{70346}{70393}no uncertain mark in politics.
{70396}{70443}ln other words,|your future member of Parliament..
{70446}{70505}your candidate, Mr--
{70508}{70582}McCrocodile.
{70584}{70627}He doesn't know the candidate's name.
{70629}{70686}l know your candidate will forgive|my referring to him..
{70688}{70769}by the friendly nickname|by which he's already known..
{70772}{70866}in anticipation, mark you..
{70869}{70936}at Westminster.
{70938}{71013}Now, ladies and gentlemen, we'll|discuss some topic. What shall it be?
{71016}{71069}- The herring fisheries!|- Unemployment!
{71071}{71158}- What about the idle rich?|- That's an old-fashioned topic..
{71160}{71235}especially for me because l'm not rich|and l've never been idle.
{71238}{71309}l've been pretty busy all my life,|and l expect to be much busier soon.
{71313}{71345}Have you ever worked|with your hands?
{71348}{71410}lndeed l have. l've known what it is|to feel lonely and helpless..
{71412}{71451}and have the whole world|against me.
{71454}{71509}Those are things that no man|or woman ought to feel.
{71511}{71548}l ask your candidate..
{71550}{71594}and all those who love|their fellowmen..
{71596}{71680}to set themselves resolutely to make|this world a happier place to live in.
{71682}{71744}A world where no nation|plots against nation..
{71746}{71787}where no neighbor|plots against neighbor..
{71789}{71839}where there is no persecution|or hunting down..
{71842}{71906}where everybody gets a square deal|and a sporting chance..
{71908}{71955}and where people try to help|and not to hinder.
{71959}{72020}A world from which suspicion|and cruelty..
{72022}{72069}and fear have been|forever banished.
{72071}{72137}That is the sort of world l want!|ls that the sort of world you want?
{72178}{72216}Fine!
{72218}{72292}That's all l have to say.|Good night!
{72601}{72698}- l kept them going as long as l could.|- You're a difficult man to follow.
{72850}{72903}l suppose you think|you've been damn clever.
{72906}{72967}- Tell your prisoner not to insult me.|- Try and stop me.
{72969}{73025}- Come along with me.|- l was speaking the truth.
{73027}{73093}You must have seen|l was genuine.
{73095}{73154}Whether you believe me or not,|will you put a telephone call through..
{73157}{73198}to High Commissioner|for Canada in London?
{73200}{73251}- Tell him an important secret--|- That will do now.
{73254}{73327}An important secret is being taken out|of this country by a foreign agent.
{73329}{73395}l can't do anything myself|because of this fool of a detective.
{73397}{73443}- Has that penetrated?|- Right to the funny bone.
{73446}{73515}- Now tell me another one.|- Haven't you any sense at all?
{73518}{73596}Put that call through!|l beg of you! Refer them to me.
{73600}{73679}- Will you do this?|- No. Good night.
{73682}{73732}l beg pardon, miss,|but we should like you to come too.
{73735}{73791}- Whatever for?|- To identify the prisoner formally.
{73794}{73830}- Will you come to the police station?|- What?
{73832}{73920}- lt's only for a few minutes.|- lf it's necessary, let's get it over.
{74281}{74312}Now you.
{74314}{74364}- Must l sit next to this man?|- lt's only for a short time.
{74366}{74410}Be as quick as you can.
{74481}{74517}All right.
{74723}{74790}lsn't that the police station?|We're running past it.
{74792}{74856}- Tell the man.|- You must have misunderstood me.
{74859}{74902}We're not exactly going|to this police station.
{74905}{74956}- Where are we going?|- To lnverary.
{74958}{75007}- lnverary?|- Yes, miss.
{75010}{75063}This man is to be questioned|by the Sheriff Principal.
{75065}{75132}- We have orders to take him there.|- You have no orders to take me.
{75135}{75183}No, miss,|but l'm afraid you must go.
{75186}{75236}l'll see you're sent back|as early as possible.
{75239}{75288}- How far is it to lnverary?|- Forty miles.
{75291}{75327}- Keep quiet.|- Sorry.
{75330}{75417}- We'll be there in less than two hours.|- l'm spending half the night with you?
{75420}{75465}lt looks like it.
{76327}{76413}lsn't the man going the wrong way?|Surely that's the way to lnverary.
{76416}{76465}There's a bridge fallen down|on that road.
{76467}{76520}We shall have to go around.|The man knows the way.
{76593}{76686}- Might l see your warrant?|- Shut your mouth. You'll see it soon.
{76825}{76914}Would you like to have|a small bet with me, Pamela?
{76917}{76972}All right, l'll have it|with you, Sherlock.
{76974}{77029}l'll lay you 100 to 1|that your Sheriff Principal..
{77031}{77114}has the top joint|of his little finger missing.
{77115}{77160}What about it?
{77216}{77265}l win.
{77268}{77330}What are we stopping for?
{77332}{77373}lt's a whole flock of detectives.
{77495}{77570}They're all over the road.|Get out and clear them away.
{77573}{77644}- What about him?|- l'll soon fix that.
{77647}{77690}There, miss.|Now you're a Special Constable.
{77692}{77759}- What's the idea?|- As long as you stay, he stays.
{77817}{77867}Yes, and as long as l go, you go.|Come on.
{77903}{77938}Stop them! They got away!
{78020}{78063}- Come on.|- l won't!
{78065}{78121}Won't you?
{78506}{78544}- You're hurting me.|- Shut up.
{78546}{78605}See if they've gone down that way.
{78875}{78931}Where could they have gone?
{79363}{79411}Help!
{79413}{79463}Let me go!
{80279}{80347}One yip out of you, and l'll|shoot you first and myself after.
{80805}{80855}There's nobody down here,|l tell you.
{80857}{80909}Come up here, blast you,|and don't waste any more time.
{80912}{80948}Spread out and find them.
{81374}{81443}They must be a mile away by now.
{81445}{81502}Don't do that.
{81504}{81579}Do stop whistling.
{81619}{81699}You can't possibly escape.|What chance have you got tied to me?
{81702}{81785}That question's for your husband. l'll|admit you're the white man's burden.
{81787}{81864}l know, and l can't tell you|what comfort that thought gives me.
{81867}{81942}What's the use of this?|Those policemen will get you<br>as soon as it's dayligh|as soon as it's daylight.
{81944}{81989}They may get me,|but they're not policemen.
{81991}{82034}- When did you find that out?|- You found that out yourself.
{82036}{82095}l should never have known|that was the wrong road to lnverary.
{82098}{82176}They were taking us to their boss, and|God help us if they ever catch us again.
{82178}{82268}l see. You're still sticking|to your penny novelette spy story.
{82270}{82314}Oh!
{82316}{82394}There are 20 million women in|this island, and l'm chained to you.
{82396}{82451}Listen, once more.|l'm telling you the truth.
{82454}{82538}l told you once in the train. l tried|to tell you after the election meeting.
{82541}{82587}l'm telling you now|for the third time.
{82590}{82676}There's a conspiracy against|this island and we're the<br>only ones who can stop it.|only ones who can stop it.
{82678}{82734}Think what you've seen happen|right under your very nose.
{82737}{82790}The gallant knight to the rescue.
{82792}{82902}All right, then l'm just a plain,|common murderer..
{82905}{82998}who stabbed an innocent, defenseless|woman in the back not four days ago.
{83000}{83059}How do you come out over that?|l don't know how innocent you may be..
{83061}{83112}but you're a woman, you're|defenseless, and you're alone..
{83114}{83183}on a desolate moor in the dark,|manacled to a murderer..
{83185}{83230}who'd stop at nothing|to get you off his hands.
{83232}{83304}lf that's the situation you prefer,|have it, my lovely, and welcome.
{83306}{83381}l'm not afraid of--
{83383}{83439}For all you know,|l may murder a woman a week.
{83513}{83560}So listen to a bit of advice.
{83563}{83667}Do every single thing l tell|you to do, and do it quick.
{83669}{83717}You big bully.
{83720}{83780}l like your pluck.|Come on.
{83975}{84009}- We're going in there.|- What for?
{84011}{84082}That's my business. Remember what|l said: the civil tongue or else.
{84084}{84172}We're going in there, and you'll|back me up on everything l say or do.
{84174}{84236}- Has that penetrated the ivory dome?|- Only just.
{84238}{84314}Pull yourself together. Put your hand|in my pocket and look in a hurry.
{84317}{84361}Come along.
{84487}{84567}Come in.|The young lady's terrible wet.
{84569}{84634}We had an accident with our car|a few miles back.
{84636}{84680}- You'll be staying the night?|- Yes.
{84683}{84749}We've just the one room left|with the one bed in it.
{84752}{84841}- But you'll not be minding that.|- No, quite the reverse.
{84844}{84901}- You're man and wife, l suppose?|- Yes.
{84905}{84941}Uh, yes.
{84944}{85011}- Have you any luggage?|- We left that behind in the car.
{85013}{85071}Maybe l could lend the young lady|a nightgown.
{85075}{85147}Will you please to register?|James, the book.
{85150}{85206}- Aye.|- l'll light the fire for you.
{85209}{85252}- Will you be needing supper?|- No, thank you.
{85255}{85310}Just a whiskey and soda|and a few sandwiches.
{85312}{85382}- And a glass of milk.|- Very well, sir.
{85385}{85440}Can't write with my left hand,|but l can shoot with it.
{85442}{85481}You can guess what's|in this pocket.
{85483}{85613}You sign, darling. The sooner you get|used to your new name, the better.
{85617}{85740}Off we go. ''Mr. and Mrs. Henry|Hopkinson, The Hollyhocks, Hammersmith.''
{85892}{85947}l'll be back in a minute, chaps.
{87202}{87282}Off with that wet skirt and|l'll have it dried in the kitchen.
{87286}{87344}Don't bother. lt'll dry|in front of the fire just as well.
{87347}{87387}Thanks all the same.
{87390}{87452}No doubt the gentleman|will take care of you.
{87454}{87505}Good night, sir.|Good night, ma'am.
{87508}{87552}Good night.
{87581}{87615}Good night.
{87664}{87744}- ls he married to her, do you think?|- l do not care.
{87746}{87799}They are so terrible in love|with each other.
{87801}{87858}l'm going to tell them|the whole story.
{87860}{87893}You want to hang me|for a murder l never committed?
{87895}{87944}As long as they hang you, l don't care|whether you committed it or not.
{87947}{87994}Let me go! Do you think l'm going|to spend the night with you?
{87996}{88084}- Of course. What else can you do?|- Can l come in?
{88087}{88131}Come here.
{88183}{88222}Come in.
{88308}{88366}We were just getting warm|before the fire.
{88368}{88441}l can see that. l thought|you'd like this in your bed.
{88443}{88495}Thank you very much. You'd like|a hot water bottle, wouldn't you?
{88497}{88541}Say yes, darling.
{88543}{88602}- Yes, darling.|- Very well.
{88604}{88674}- Please don't go.|- Why not?
{88676}{88738}ls anything wrong?
{88742}{88800}Of course there's nothing wrong.|She just wants to tell you something.
{88803}{88911}- We're a runaway couple.|- l knew it. They're after you?
{88914}{88960}You won't give us away,|will you? Please.
{88963}{89020}Of course we will not give you up.
{89023}{89072}A good night to you both.
{89074}{89133}- You'll not be disturbed.|- But--
{89362}{89426}Thank God for a bite to eat.|Come along.
{89429}{89473}There you are.
{89561}{89605}What's the next item|on the program?
{89608}{89692}- Get these things off.|- Right. How will we set about it?
{89695}{89746}Anything in that bag of yours|that will help?
{89749}{89850}- A pair of scissors or a hairpin?|- Do you think a nail file would help?
{89852}{89906}Easily. lt'll take about ten years,|but we can try it.
{89908}{89946}Let's make ourselves comfortable.
{89949}{90020}What about that skirt of yours?|lt's still pretty damp.
{90022}{90089}l don't want to be tied to a pneumonia|case on top of everything else.
{90091}{90150}- Take it off. l don't mind.|- l'll keep it on, thank you.
{90153}{90209}And that is that.
{90211}{90263}My shoes and stockings are soaked.|l think l'll take them off.
{90266}{90322}That's the first sensible thing|l've heard you say.
{90325}{90385}- Can l be of any assistance?|- No, thank you.
{90388}{90423}Sorry.
{90607}{90650}- Hold this.|- Yeah.
{90905}{90949}Half a minute.
{91133}{91186}- Thank you.|- Don't mention it.
{91188}{91247}- Do you like your milk now?|- No, thank you. l'll wait a little.
{91250}{91297}All right.
{91299}{91339}Cheerio.
{91387}{91422}That's better.
{91424}{91471}- Are your feet quite warm again?|- Yes, thanks.
{91473}{91509}Come on.
{91561}{91637}Will you kindly place yourself|on the operating table?
{91639}{91712}Nobody's gonna hurt you.|This is Armistice Day.
{91715}{91771}- Let's get some rest while we can.|- l'm not going to lie on this bed.
{91775}{91826}So long as you're chained to me,|you'll lie wherever l lie.
{91828}{91881}- We're the Siamese twins.|- Don't gloat.
{91883}{91928}Do you think l'm looking forward|to waking up in the morning..
{91932}{92006}and seeing your face beside me,|unwashed and shiny?
{92009}{92093}What a sight you'll be. Give me that|nail file. Let's have a go at this.
{92126}{92162}Thank you.
{92165}{92220}There l go again.
{92223}{92266}l wish l could get|that damn tune out of my head.
{92268}{92316}l wonder where l heard it.
{92358}{92436}- You sound very sleepy.|- Sleepy? l'll say so.
{92439}{92482}Do you know when l|last slept in a bed?
{92484}{92560}Saturday night, whenever that was.|Then l only got a couple of hours.
{92563}{92644}- What made you wake so soon? Dreams?|- What do you mean ''dreams''?
{92646}{92721}l've always been told|murderers have terrible dreams.
{92724}{92798}But only at the first.|Got over that a long time ago.
{92801}{92853}When l first took to crime,|l was quite squeamish about it.
{92856}{92909}- l was a most sensitive child.|- You surprise me.
{92912}{92976}Used to wake screaming,|thinking the police were after me.
{92978}{93032}But one gets hardened.
{93034}{93104}- How did you start?|- Quite a small way, like most of us.
{93106}{93170}Pilfering pennies from other|children's lockers at school..
{93173}{93235}then a little pocket picking,|then a spot of car pinching..
{93237}{93302}then smash and grab|and so on to plain burglary.
{93305}{93354}Killed my first man|when l was 19.
{93417}{93477}ln years to come, you'll be able|to take your grandchildren..
{93481}{93531}to Madame Tussaud's|and point me out.
{93534}{93622}- Which section?|- lt's early to say. l'm still young.
{93624}{93689}But l'll be there, all right,|in one department or another.
{93692}{93763}You'll point me out and say,|''Chicks, if l were to tell you..
{93766}{93825}how matey l once was|with that gentleman, you'd be--''
{93827}{93911}- What's the matter?|- This handcuff is pinching my wrist.
{93913}{93951}Sorry.
{93953}{94005}Talking of Madame Tussaud's,|that's how it all began.
{94007}{94057}- What began?|- My career of crime.
{94060}{94120}All hereditary.|Great Uncle Penruddock.
{94124}{94192}- Who was he?|- My girl, where were you brought up?
{94196}{94273}Never heard of my Great Uncle|Penruddock, the Cornish Bluebeard?
{94275}{94349}-Got it all from him.|- l thought your family came from Canada.
{94351}{94422}No, that's where they went|after the Penruddock incident.
{94424}{94479}He murdered three wives|and got away with it.
{94482}{94552}His third mother-in-law got the goods|on him and tried to have him arrested.
{94555}{94656}Did she succeed?|No, he was too quick for her.
{94659}{94747}Took her for a walk to Land's End and|shoved her into the Atlantic Ocean.
{94787}{94821}He's in Madame Tussaud's.
{94825}{94875}There's no doubt|about his department.
{94878}{94921}You must go down|and see him sometime.
{94923}{94987}Can't mistake him.|Third on the left as you go in.
{94990}{95033}Red whiskers and a harelip.
{95067}{95147}That, lady,|is the sad story of my life.
{95150}{95231}Poor orphan boy|who never had a chance.
{95234}{95297}Are you still set on|giving me up to the police?
{95763}{95807}You're sure everything's|going to be all right?
{95811}{95866}Bound to be.|He can't have much time.
{95868}{95967}As soon as l've picked up you know|what, l'll clear out of the country.
{95969}{96014}Be careful.
{96016}{96060}Wire to me.
{96182}{96233}- Good-bye, my dear.|- Good-bye.
{99570}{99688}ls that Professor Jordan's house?|Can l speak to Mrs. Jordan then?
{99721}{99775}ls that Mrs. Jordan?
{99832}{99882}He's gone to London already?
{99885}{99966}- lf you manage, l'd like hot whiskey.|- l'll get the hot water.
{99968}{100031}No, he ducked down a side street,|the police went the wrong way.
{100033}{100106}The girl handed him over to us,|thinking we were detectives.
{100108}{100159}We had to take her as well|because he told her everything.
{100217}{100284}Very good, ma'am. l see.|Yes, ma'am.
{100344}{100402}- Well?|- The old man's got the wind up.
{100405}{100452}- He's cleared out already.|- Whatever for?
{100454}{100523}He thought it too dangerous|with Hannay on the loose.
{100526}{100570}He's warning the whole 39 Steps.
{100573}{100648}- Has he got the-- you know?|- Yes.
{100651}{100721}He's picking up our friend at the|London Palladium on the way out.
{100723}{100802}Here's toddy.|That will be half a crown.
{100804}{100867}- And the phone call?|- We'll say a schilling.
{101007}{101085}- ls this a hotel as well?|- Aye.
{101088}{101154}- Do you have people staying here?|- Aye.
{101157}{101233}- You get a few this time of year?|- Aye.
{101264}{101321}- Did you have anyone in tonight?|- Aye.
{101324}{101418}They weren't by any chance|a young couple?
{101420}{101493}James, do not finish!
{101495}{101559}What kind of a silly creature|am l married to?
{101561}{101606}Do you want to get us all jailed?
{101608}{101671}- How much did you take for these?|- Half a crown.
{101757}{101800}Out, the pair of you!
{101803}{101885}Do not let on to anybody that|you got a drink here after hours.
{101887}{101932}Ohh!
{102129}{102233}You old fool.|Would you give away a young couple?
{104743}{104802}Good morning.
{104851}{104908}What's the idea?|How did we get out of these?
{104912}{105011}You didn't. l slipped out of mine|last night and camped out here.
{105014}{105071}- Why didn't you run away?|- l did, but just as l was going..
{105074}{105162}l discovered that you've|been speaking the truth.
{105164}{105217}l decided to stay.
{105219}{105295}May l ask what earthquake|caused your brain to work at last?
{105297}{105354}Those two men were in here last night.|l overheard them telephoning.
{105357}{105462}- What did they say?|- A lot of stuff about the 39 Steps.
{105465}{105525}- You-- Go on.|- What?
{105527}{105587}Someone's going to warn them.|How can you warn steps?
{105591}{105653}- Never mind. Go on.|- Yes, and there was another thing.
{105656}{105745}Someone got scared|and is clearing out and--
{105747}{105818}Yes, l know. And is picking up someone|at the London Palladium.
{105820}{105866}London Palladium?|What the devil?
{105869}{105971}ls that the professor with half|of the little finger missing?
{105974}{106018}What does he want|to go there for?
{106121}{106183}l feel such a fool,|not having believed you.
{106186}{106229}That's all right.
{106263}{106358}We ought to get a move on.
{106360}{106418}- What room are those two men in?|- No room.
{106422}{106472}They went as soon|as they telephoned.
{106510}{106584}- They what?|- Didn't l tell you?
{106586}{106638}You let them go|after hearing what they said?
{106640}{106707}- You button-headed little idiot.|- Don't talk to me like that!
{106709}{106782}Four or five precious hours wasted!|Why didn't you wake me up at once?
{106785}{106840}Even you might have realized|what they said was important.
{106843}{106887}Why not leave well enough alone?
{106889}{106948}Let well alone?|Good girl, l'm accused of murder!
{106950}{107024}Can't you realize the only way l can|clear myself is to expose these spies?
{107028}{107078}You still can. The man's going|to the London Palladium.
{107081}{107147}Really? First or second house?|l'll get there five hours late!
{107149}{107202}- Fine! The show will suit you.|- What's that?
{107205}{107241}Crazy Month!
{107674}{107729}You're quite right, madame.
{107731}{107840}The Air Ministry has got a new thing|a lot of people are interested in.
{107842}{107916}But they are positive that no papers|are missing about it..
{107918}{107963}that would be of any use|to a spy.
{107966}{108057}l'm certain about it. A man is leaving|the country tonight with something.
{108060}{108117}Since you phoned us from Scotland|this morning..
{108120}{108177}we've made the minutest inquiries.
{108317}{108361}lt's obvious|l'm wasting my time here.
{108363}{108410}Just a moment, miss, please.
{108413}{108464}There's one thing|you haven't told us.
{108489}{108536}Where's Richard Hannay?
{108594}{108647}l haven't the faintest idea.
{108649}{108691}Look here, miss, you can't--
{108694}{108755}- You're in the telephone book?|- Yes.
{108758}{108812}lf anything crops up,|we'll give you a ring.
{108815}{108866}That will be all now.|Thank you.
{108991}{109069}Tell Archer and Seagrave to get|another taxi and follow that girl.
{109071}{109115}She'll lead us to Hannay.
{109731}{109827}Love is a flower that blooms
{110102}{110174}Cover every exit, and on no account|let anyone leave the building.
{110177}{110221}You two men go|in the orchestra pit.
{110223}{110324}Ladies and gentlemen,|we shall now sing.
{110762}{110848}Come on. Move along there,|please. Come on, sir.
{110910}{110992}- No one's allowed to leave the theater.|- Can't a mate go out and have a drink?
{110995}{111057}- Ticket, please.|- l'm just looking for someone.
{111060}{111128}- Can l go through, please?|- Very good.
{111741}{111834}She's seen him.|She's on her way down to the stalls.
{112480}{112564}May l borrow your opera glasses,|please?
{112669}{112736}Excuse me.|May l take your place, please?
{112739}{112805}What are you doing here?|l found him. He's up in that box.
{112808}{112862}You can't do anything about it.|l've been to Scotland Yard.
{112864}{112924}Nothing has been stolen from the Air|Ministry. They're certain about it.
{112926}{112990}You heard those men say|he got in there. There he is.
{113027}{113096}Shall we take him now|or wait till the interval?
{113143}{113216}What you going to do? There's nothing|missing. There's an end to it.
{113501}{113593}Hear that tune? That's that damn thing|l couldn't get out of my head.
{113596}{113674}Now l know where l heard it before.|Of course, that music hall.
{113676}{113714}Annabella's--
{113763}{113814}Ladies and gentlemen..
{113816}{113876}with your kind attention|and permission..
{113879}{113948}l have now the honor|to present to you..
{113950}{114009}one of the most remarkable men|in the world.
{114013}{114101}- That's the same man.|- Every day he commits to memory..
{114103}{114185}50 new facts,|and remembers every one of them.
{114189}{114273}Facts from history,|from geography..
{114275}{114361}from newspapers,|from scientific textbooks..
{114363}{114468}millions and millions of them|down to the smallest detail.
{114471}{114546}Test him, ladies and gentlemen.|Ask him any question.
{114549}{114612}l've got it! Of course|there are no papers missing.
{114614}{114659}All the information's|inside Memory's head.
{114662}{114712}Mr. Memory.
{114714}{114767}- l still don't understand.|- Don't you see?
{114770}{114864}The details of that Air|Ministry secret were borrowed,<br>memorized by this man..|memorized by this man..
{114867}{114913}and then replaced before|anyone could find out.
{114916}{114993}That's why he's here: to take Memory|out of the country after the show.
{114996}{115063}- Surely--|- Some gentlemen want to speak to you.
{115066}{115119}Question, please.
{115122}{115151}Question, please.
{115154}{115224}- Where's the boat race?|- When did Florence Nightingale die?
{115226}{115276}- How tall is the Empire State Building?|- Are you Richard Hannay?
{115279}{115325}- There's something you should know.|- Come along quietly.
{115327}{115385}- That man on the stage--|- Don't cause any trouble..
{115387}{115472}- and spoil people's entertainment.|- What date did General Gordon die?
{115475}{115513}What are the 39 Steps?
{115549}{115628}Come on, answer up!|What are the 39 Steps?
{115631}{115720}The 39 Steps is an organization|of spies..
{115722}{115796}collecting information on behalf|of the foreign office of--
{116348}{116428}Keep your seats, please!
{116432}{116492}There is no need for alarm,|no cause for alarm.
{116518}{116566}- l'm all right.|- Sure you are.
{116568}{116629}l don't want a chair.|Let me rest here.
{116632}{116690}- l'm all right.|- Take it easy now.
{116692}{116748}- Take it easy.|- l'm all right.
{116750}{116806}Get the girls on straightaway!
{116844}{116896}The girls' introduction right away.
{116899}{116944}Mr. Memory,|what was the secret formula..
{116946}{116996}you were taking out of the country?
{117044}{117096}Would it be all right,|me telling you, sir?
{117100}{117142}lt was a big job to learn it..
{117145}{117189}the biggest job l ever tackled..
{117191}{117261}- and l don't want to throw it all away.|- lt'll be quite all right.
{117265}{117308}The first feature|of the new engine is..
{117311}{117359}its greatly increased ratio|of compression..
{117362}{117440}represented by R minus l over R|to the power of gamma..
{117442}{117537}where R represents the ratio|of compression and gamma--
{117539}{117653}Seen in end elevation, the axis|of the two lines of cylinders--
{117656}{117727}Angle of 65 degrees.
{117730}{117821}Dimensions of cylinders|as follows--
{117824}{117934}This device renders the engine|completely silent.
{117936}{117980}Am l right, sir?
{117982}{118026}Quite right, old chap.
{118028}{118101}Thank you, sir.|Thank you.
{118104}{118187}l'm glad it's off my mind,|at last.
