1
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,960
Sadk, where have you been?
I have called the paper, the club.

2
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,480
You could let me know that
you would be late and...

3
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,360
- Have you been worried?
- Of course, I have been worried.

4
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,440
It is a mess out there, you know.

5
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,120
You have been drinking.

6
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,440
Yes, just a little with the guys from
the paper, they insisted so much...

7
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,720
Sadk, you should be careful these days.
You know, it is about to come.

8
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,320
I am sorry, you are right.
They did not publish my article...

9
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,160
...and that made me a bit upset.
- Oh, yes. I checked the paper this morning

10
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,480
- It was not there.
- That's the new editor.

11
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,520
He is scared or something, whatever.
Is there raki?

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,440
- No.
- Why not?

13
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,880
I have drunk all, that's why.
You know, we are 2...

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,600
...we are getting mad.
- OK, I got it.

15
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,800
It is so hot.

16
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,560
- How is the beast?
- Fine.

17
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,000
Today I've had so much pain.
I was almost sure that it is coming.

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,960
- Don't call it 'beast'. What if it's a she?
- No matter...

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,040
It is welcomed, then.

20
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,800
We are going to hospital
tomorrow afternoon.

21
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,800
Yes, it is welcomed, but not tonight. I'd
not let you hold it while you are drunk.

22
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,680
No way. I am sure that you would
drop it right onto the head.

23
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,320
I would not. I would drink three cups of
coffee, continuously.

24
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,480
I would not.

25
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,560
It is my precious.

26
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Take this pillow. It is rehearsal time.

27
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,960
OK. Not from the back, from the
nape of the neck. Careful with the head.

28
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,160
Sadk, it is coming.

29
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,440
- What? Now?
- Find a cab, quick. It is coming earlier.

30
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,000
OK, be calm.

31
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,280
My wallet.

32
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,800
God damn it.

33
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,480
OK, hold me, we can find a cab outside.
The hospital is not far. 5 minutes, only.

34
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,760
Do not say 5 minutes.
I feel like delivering right here.

35
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,800
- Help! Aysun is giving birth.
- Do not waste time.

36
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,360
- OK, take deep breaths.
- Do not make me breathe.

37
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,560
We can find a cab in a second.

38
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,960
Where the hell are they?

39
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,640
Help!

40
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,160
Is not there anybody here?

41
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,920
Damn it!

42
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,520
God damn you all! Where the hell are you?
What happened to everyone?

43
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,120
I can't walk any more.

44
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,160
Aysun be calm. Come here.

45
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,240
Do not talk, do not tire yourself.

46
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,520
Lie down.

47
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,520
Lie down. Lie down.

48
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,320
My water broke. Do something.
It is coming. The baby.

49
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,840
Help us you jerks! Wake up!

50
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,240
What is it, pal? Accident?

51
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,200
My wife is dead The baby was born.

52
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,560
She lost too much blood.

53
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,000
No nothing. Nobody helped.

54
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,360
I call an ambulance.

55
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,560
Where is everybody?

56
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,320
There has been a military coup.

57
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,240
It has not started yet, don't touch it.

58
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,480
What are you doing? Come and
eat your meal. Don't slam the doors!

59
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,760
- I do not. I am just checking the rooms.
- What for?

60
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,120
For catching the dwarves. As soon as
I turn my back, they come out of the book.

61
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,920
What dwarves? You are the only dwarf
here. Is there anybody else here?

62
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,360
Yes, there is. You do not see them,
they are hiding.

63
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,400
The dwarves in Gulliver and also in Alice.

64
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,200
As Alice gets bigger,
the other ones stay the same, you know.

65
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,800
Which Alish? Is he the one who hit
you with a bottle the other day?

66
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,480
No, his name is Ali and he couldn't hit
me at all. Alice is a girl in the book.

67
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,240
- You do not know her.
- Whatever.

68
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,720
Eat your meal.

69
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,520
- Fatma?
- Yes, my dear.

70
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,840
You know my dad gave some pocket
money yesterday. Can we buy Lucky Luke.

71
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,640
There is also Joe Dalton,
you know, little Joe Dalton...

72
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,760
OK, when your dad arrives, you go.

73
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,960
Welcome.

74
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,520
- How are you?
- Fine.

75
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,520
- Is he sleeping?
- He drank buttermilk.

76
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:16,400
He is sweating. There is fried
eggplant and green pepper.

77
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,240
I know you like it.
Summer is the best of all.

78
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,160
Preparing a meal is so easy in summer.
A watermelon would be nice, too.

79
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,520
- Has Deniz's grandma dropped by?
- Yeah, she has come and gone.

80
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,640
You should have seen her
with all her arrogance.

81
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,720
- Have you had an argument?
- Why would I?

82
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,000
She has talked about
the same things again that...

83
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,760
...we are not good enough to look after
Deniz, she misses her daughter...

84
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,280
...you should not have got married,
mumbo-jumbo. Nonsense.

85
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,320
She does not admit that
she can't look after her grandson.

86
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,720
If she deals with him, how can she will
have time to fool around?

87
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,840
She is going to Bodrum again.

88
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,760
She has pretended to offer to take Deniz
with her. Just pretended.

89
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,680
Also, she brought half kilo of mince
meat for him.

90
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,040
I told her that his father fulfills
all his needs...

91
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,200
...meatballs or liver are not the case.
Did you like my response?

92
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,840
She brought a shirt as a present.
It is so large that it is on his knees.

93
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,520
I said he will start to wear it
after 3 years.

94
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,840
You are quite something, though.
What did Deniz do?

95
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,280
He read a book called
"The Treasure of Alice" or something.

96
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,440
He has been talking about it all day and
he wants Little Joe-book with his money.

97
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,440
Books are all matters to him. He reads a
lot and never becomes naughty.

98
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,560
What happened? What did they say?

99
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,120
We are leaving.
Just as we have talked.

100
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,480
Do not forget.

101
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,920
My position is hard.

102
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,920
God damn all the ones
who made us suffer like this.

103
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,040
Enough for that.

104
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,680
All right. I am going to bring your meal.

105
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,480
I am leaving your money here.
It is for the last two months.

106
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,480
I do not want it,
what you paid so far is enough.

107
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,920
Please take it.

108
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,440
I will clean the house regularly,
when you are away.

109
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,120
Maybe you will come back some day.

110
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,520
- We will never come back.
- Let me bring your meal.

111
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,640
Hey, young blood! Good morning,
I fall asleep, I guess.

112
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,280
That's because we have got up so early.

113
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,680
Dad, what is the speed of this train,
you think? 100 kilometers?

114
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,480
Not that much.

115
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,000
So it is not faster than cars, right?
But still fast.

116
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,760
When I woke up,
I tried to count the trees, but up to 80.

117
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,160
After that, we speeded up.

118
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,680
- I wish we had a gun.
- Why is that?

119
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,920
In case of Indians' attack.
They block the railway.

120
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,360
When the train stops
and they get all the gold.

121
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,680
We do not have any gold,
so we are not in trouble.

122
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,240
You are not excited at all.

123
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,600
Take this.

124
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,000
I used to be an excited man.
I cannot take it any more.

125
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,400
- I told you. Indians. There is a robbery!
- Stay around, do not go too far.

126
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,120
Cowboy Dennis pointed
his guns to Indians.

127
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,760
Indians were caught unawares.

128
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,160
They raised their hands and surrendered.

129
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,120
No one dares to deal with Cowboy Dennis.

130
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,040
It is just the police.

131
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,880
Have a good trip. ID control.

132
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,680
Who is this handsome guy? Your son?

133
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,640
Have a good trip.

134
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,760
All right, shall we repeat once again
what we have talked about?

135
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,120
- I have not forgotten them!
- Let me hear, then.

136
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,200
When we get home, I won't ask too much
questions. I will be good.

137
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,720
I won't get upset if there will be
arguments, because grandpa is a bit weird.

138
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,640
It is so crowded, there.
It is a big family.

139
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,440
It is our family, but they have
their own problems too.

140
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,240
- Among themselves too.
- Yes.

141
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,600
I will not ask any questions to my
uncle about his condition...

142
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,000
...because my uncle,
your brother, is not like us.

143
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,760
He realizes things more slowly,
but he is a great man.

144
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,480
And I will not fight with the kids.

145
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,400
I will not call my grandpa as "grandpa",
until he likes me.

146
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,120
He may not like me at the beginning,
I will not be sorry for it.

147
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,240
If he likes me then,
I can call him "grandpa".

148
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,080
Why are we going to grandpa's?

149
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,000
You are asking too many questions.

150
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,920
You do not love me any more.

151
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,200
- What?
- Nothing.

152
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,080
- Dad, you are hurting me.
- Am I?

153
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,080
I am sorry.

154
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,760
Stop!

155
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,440
No one is around.
They might be at the field.

156
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,320
- They will return soon, then.
- You think so?

157
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,640
How do you know? You smart ass!

158
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,240
Hi, hero!

159
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,800
Are you my grandpa?

160
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,480
My son!

161
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,640
Welcome little boss.
What brings you here?

162
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,320
Stop chattering, take
the horse into the barn.

163
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,600
You should have informed us.

164
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,840
My boy! I am your grandma.

165
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,040
How old are you now?

166
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,440
Where are you going?

167
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,320
- Where are you going?
- Let him go!

168
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,840
I dare you to go after him!
You cannot come back here again!

169
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,480
Dad, where are you going?

170
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,760
All right, then,
I am coming with you, this time.

171
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,440
I swear, I will, Sadk!

172
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,200
Prepare my suitcase.

173
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,360
You have left here once and
it will not happen again.

174
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,400
I will lie down in front you and
you'll have to step over me.

175
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,360
Last time I kept silent,
but this time I will beat you up.

176
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,480
You are not going anywhere.

177
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,040
Come on, come in.

178
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,840
Follow me to upstairs.

179
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,640
Did you like our home?

180
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,520
Go on...

181
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,320
Yes, that room.

182
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,920
Little Deniz and his dad entered the
woods which was cursed by a dreadful witch

183
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,520
Along the way the witch and
her beasts tried to kidnap Deniz...

184
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,960
...and throw him into a cursed well.

185
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,160
Deniz realized that
but did not scare at all...

186
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,440
...because his hero dad was with him.

187
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,640
Come on, you must be tired,
change your clothes.

188
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,120
Are you hungry?
Are you gonna take a nap or eat?

189
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,600
What shall I? I am leaving.

190
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,080
Oh God, today is my happiest day!

191
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
Welcome.

192
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,200
Thanks. I am sorry. I could not
even say hello to you at first place.

193
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,320
It is OK.

194
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,760
Sakine, let's make some
chicory salad. Sadk likes it.

195
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,040
We've some cowpea, too. We are
downstairs, change your clothes and come.

196
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:19,600
Hurry Sakine, let's cut one of the hens
and prepare soup for our grandson.

197
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,960
At last, my wish has come true.

198
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,880
Don't mind your dad.

199
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,920
He may be sulking for a few days, then...

200
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,120
He is a crazy man, you know.

201
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,600
- We'll work this out, right?
- Yes, we will, mum.

202
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,400
We have the exact same photograph
at home. Right, dad?

203
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,080
Our home is here, Deniz.
Try to get used to here, OK?

204
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,680
Hurry, close the door.

205
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,840
- Hold it!
- I am.

206
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,920
From Crop 1 to Crop 2!

207
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,600
From Crop 1 to Crop 2,
can you hear me?

208
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,360
Mum, is that you?
I can hear you. Over.

209
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,200
My daughter in law! How it's going?
Is Salim there? Over.

210
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,640
He is here, mum. What's up? Over.

211
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,400
Sadk is here! Over.

212
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,560
What? Over.

213
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,040
Take Salim and the kids and come
to the dinner. Over.

214
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,960
Shall I call my aunt? Over.

215
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:43,000
I will. Come on, don't hang around.
Hurry up! Over.

216
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,720
I bet you've never eaten
anything like this.

217
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,080
Come on, taste it.
Don't wait for the other ones.

218
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,000
- Don't wait them.
- I won't eat this chichen.

219
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,600
- Why not?
- You killed it, that's why.

220
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:23,840
It is chicken, dear.
Of course, it is cut and we eat it.

221
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,840
- What a weird boy!
- I am not weird.

222
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,560
Mum, when did you buy those walkies?

223
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:38,280
Your dad bought them. It is in fashion
now and communication is free.

224
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,840
- Can you teach Deniz how to use it?
- Of course, I can.

225
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,560
- May I use?
- Of course.

226
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,720
Let me turn it on for you.

227
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,760
Come over here.

228
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,720
- Whom do you speak with it?
- We do, with other farms.

229
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,800
Are you police?

230
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,760
Oh yes, I am. We catch thieves.

231
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,280
Good evening, dad.

232
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,120
I am going to coffee house, Nuran.

233
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,520
Thanks for welcoming me, dad.

234
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,520
This is quite normal at the beginning.
Just keep silent for a while.

235
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,040
Just wait until the things settle
down. If not, I know exactly what to do.

236
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,800
Hseyin! Look at him! I'll beat you up,
don't run like that.

237
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,680
We are here, grandpa.

238
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,360
Good evening, dad. Are you leaving?

239
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,600
Hurry! Don't be late!
It is your mother, isn't it?

240
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,560
- Dad, Sadk has come.
- Yeah, that crap has come.

241
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,840
Come on, Salim. Don't ask anything.
Can't you see how furious he is?

242
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,360
Hseyin! Did you go to the barn?
You are so dead. Give me your hand.

243
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,120
Salim, go and take a look at him.

244
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,040
Damn it! What?

245
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:27,160
How would you like I bend
your ear, now? I said "don't run", right?

246
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,120
What the hell? God damn you! Don't.

247
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,640
Mum, where are you all?

248
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,880
Are you here, already? Come on,
we are on dinner.

249
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,120
Mum, Sadk has come, Sadk has come.

250
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,680
Like she does not know!

251
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,760
My dear brother, my precious!

252
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,520
My dear! Is this the beast?

253
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,560
Come and kiss my hand, boy.
I am your uncle.

254
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,040
- No, don't do that!
- Poor guy has missed him so much.

255
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,800
Salim, you are a mature guy. Behave
yourself. The kid is here, what a shame!

256
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,800
I cannot help it, I am so touched.

257
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,720
I am sorry, Sadk. Welcome you both.

258
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,560
I am your uncle's wife. Kiss my hand.

259
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,840
My name is Hanife.

260
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
This is Hseyin, your grandpa's name.

261
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:36,120
This is Ayegl. Did you get it?

262
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,400
- You are cousins.
- Meet and become friends.

263
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,760
This is our festival, our reunion.

264
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,680
All my children are here.
Your aunt is absent only.

265
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,400
However, she may be come
in any moment.

266
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,760
It touches me, mum.
He was a little boy, when he left.

267
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,480
Not that little, brother! I was a big man.

268
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,760
It's been years.
It touches me so much.

269
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,520
OK, we get it, Salim.
We are all touched and it is over now.

270
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,680
He'll surely repeat this for a while.

271
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,600
This must be your aunt.
We are complete now.

272
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,480
I am coming.
Look how she is knocking the door.

273
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,160
She is going to break it, crazy girl!

274
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,840
Are you testing your strength
on the door, sister?

275
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,560
Is your sulking husband here?
If so, I won't come in.

276
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,960
I'll just say hello to Sadk from here.

277
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,840
He went to the coffee house.
He didn't stay here, can you believe it?

278
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,520
He slumped the door from this very
first night and left.

279
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,720
You should see him in all his arrogance.

280
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,440
I'd be surprised, if he stayed.
He has no courage to face him.

281
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,360
- OK, I am going to enter, if you are lying
- Come in, why should I lie to you?

282
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,640
- The last thing I need is your arguments.
- OK, then. I enter.

283
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,120
- Welcome aunt!
- Yeah, sure I am. Kiss my hand.

284
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,440
We are complete now.
Everybody is here.

285
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,040
The big aunt is the last one to come.
She is our most precious guest tonight.

286
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,760
Come and meet your aunt, Deniz.
No one else is left.

287
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,320
Hello, pleased to meet you.

288
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,600
Oh, look at him! He is so sweet.

289
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,560
When have we last seen him?
Was he 2 or what?

290
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,360
Hush, if he hears OK, let me explain.

291
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,120
When you are a baby, your dad
brought you to zmir few times.

292
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,000
Few times we have come to
stanbul to see you.

293
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,600
Your grandpa doesn't know about it.
Don't blurt out, OK?

294
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,800
Pretend like this is the first
time we met.

295
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,760
Why are you hiding it from my grandpa?
He does not like us, does he?

296
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,360
Don't be sorry, my dear. That pig never
liked anyone all of his life.

297
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,720
Don't be so hard on him. He is the
eldest in the family, after all.

298
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,000
The kid has asked. He should know
about everything.

299
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,040
OK, whatever.

300
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,800
OK, my dear? You are not telling
anything to your grandpa.

301
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,040
I am going to tell.

302
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,240
Then see what'll happen. I'll nail you
up to the ceiling from your ears and...

303
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,840
...you'll spend rest of your life there.

304
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,960
Glbeyaz, once again you are with us,
in this house. What a big moment!

305
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,160
I had sworn not to come here again, but it
does not matter any more. Sadk is here.

306
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,440
We'll feed the dogs so that
you don't sin.

307
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:57,280
Don't try me! Don't you feel
ashamed at all for teasing me like that?

308
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,880
Tell us, what brings you here?

309
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,560
Do you intend to leave right away
or stay for a while?

310
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,200
I thought it was the time to come
back here after all these years.

311
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,080
Deniz has grown up and I thought the
time has come for you to know him better.

312
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,080
- I guess, you are right.
- You should have come before.

313
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,160
It's going to be great, may God be with
us. We have all summer ahead of us.

314
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,120
He is your father, you have to compromise
on some point.

315
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,840
This is ridiculous.

316
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,280
Compromising is not an
option for Hseyin.

317
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,680
He is so stubborn. Look Sadk, you are
like my son.

318
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,360
If you don't feel comfortable in here,
don't hesitate to come to my house.

319
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,800
- It is big enough...
- Don't confuse him, Glbeyaz.

320
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,480
I am going to the bathroom.

321
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,280
Let me tell you everything, little boy.
You should know all.

322
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,560
What? He should know our history.

323
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,160
Your grandpa has offended me
long time ago.

324
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,560
You know, your grandma
and I are sisters.

325
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,400
Property was shared out between us.
It is inherited from our dad.

326
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,880
When your grandpa got married to
your grandma...

327
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,960
...he did not hesitate to pocket 2 lines
of trees from my land.

328
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,680
It was my share, I have the deed.

329
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,480
You are quite aware of the fact that
we couldn't let the crop rot.

330
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,240
We send your share every year.

331
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,120
Your husband should have been
concerned about the land, instead of...

332
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,120
...killing time in the coffee house.
- Don't talk behind a dead man.

333
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,760
Let me make your bed with these
clean sheets.

334
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,360
Have you ever seen a ground bed?

335
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,560
You'll a great sleep now.
Come on, come to bed.

336
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,360
At last the guests have left, right?

337
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,640
The kid is so tired of that much
talking and noise.

338
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:06,360
Go to sleep now, you must be tired.
I will tell you a tale tomorrow night.

339
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,440
Are we going to stay here tomorrow?

340
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,040
- Can I talk to you outside, mum?
- We can talk later.

341
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,840
What is the rush? Go to sleep,
you are tired, we'll talk tomorrow.

342
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,240
- We need to talk, mum.
- I said, we'll talk.

343
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,720
Don't leave the boy alone in his
first night, he may get scared.

344
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,040
Go to sleep. We'll talk tomorrow.
Good night.

345
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,200
Mum!

346
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,360
Won't you come to the bed?

347
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,600
Sure, I am coming! What a question!

348
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,600
What happened?
Why aren't you in your bed?

349
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,760
It feels so hard and the
sheets smell like soap.

350
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,920
Because they are clean.

351
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,280
- Go to your bed.
- What about sleeping here?

352
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,480
I'll sleep there, then.

353
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,240
- Don't go, dad!
- Let go off me!

354
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,840
You don't love me any more.
You will leave me here, right?

355
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,480
I am leaving tomorrow. I am going to
get on a train and leave here.

356
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,600
I'll go to Fatma. I don't like it here.

357
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,400
Stop crying, all right.

358
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,840
You never turned me down,
when I wanted to sleep beside you.

359
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,560
Now you want me to go, because
you don't love me any more.

360
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,800
Don't smoke that shit in here,
it smells so bad.

361
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,040
Why did they come here?
Has he told you anything?

362
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,880
This is his home,
where he is supposed to come.

363
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,680
Is he a stranger?
He is your own son, Hseyin.

364
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,080
You cannot call him "they".

365
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,760
He should have behaved as a son, then.

366
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,480
I sent him to stanbul to
study agriculture.

367
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,080
He became an anarchist journalist.

368
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,320
Is this what a son's supposed to do?

369
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,760
If you argue with him,
if they leave because of you,

370
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,760
I swear, I'll go after him to stanbul.
Mind your language.

371
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,920
I am not going to let him be
crushed once again.

372
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,880
- I swear I'll divorce you.
- Don't be ridiculous.

373
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,480
Ridiculous or not, I dare you.
Look, I swear on Koran.

374
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,120
We were unaware about his imprisonment.

375
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,400
We didn't know about our grandson
until he was a year old.

376
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,200
What a hostility!

377
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,520
Poor kid is growing up without a mum.

378
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,600
- Where are you going again?
- I'll smoke.

379
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,320
Smoke shit!

380
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,400
You don't see anything, you don't
hear anything, dad!

381
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,560
You are not even aware of what's
going on in the world.

382
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,240
- You are a slave of your capital.
- I am not a slave of anything!

383
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,360
Mind your language.

384
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,160
Sure, you are great Hseyin Agha, right?
You have your own slaves...

385
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,600
Don't be rude!
Those "slaves" are our own people.

386
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,720
They have all social security.

387
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,400
We've never discriminated them and
none of them was so ungrateful like you.

388
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,680
It is that "capital" will make you study
in stanbul, are you aware of that?

389
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,280
- I don't want your money, don't send it.
- You will.

390
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,480
You will study agriculture and
manage this farm.

391
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,960
For whom all my work and
effort are, you think?

392
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,480
Superhero dad of little
Deniz suddenly disappeared and...

393
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,720
Deniz was all alone
in the middle of the woods.

394
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,600
Might the dreadful witch catch
his dad and lock him down?

395
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,640
What is it, aren't you asleep already?

396
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,320
No, I have to pee.

397
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,320
Go and do it.

398
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,560
What have we talked about earlier?
You are a big boy.

399
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,040
If you are scared, pee to the garden.
Just let it go.

400
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,200
I am not scared.
I won't pee to the garden.

401
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,200
This is not our house, that's why.

402
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,640
All right.

403
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,200
Deniz the hero decided
to go to the courtyard...

404
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,560
...in order to prove how brave he is.

405
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:38,440
All the creatures of the night seem to
cooperate to frighten him.

406
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,920
However,
nothing can stop a brave child.

407
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,520
Go to your bed!

408
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,480
That's my treasure.

409
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,240
They are all mine.

410
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,520
Did you do it?

411
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,200
There is a secret room down there.
No one is allowed to enter.

412
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,880
Let's sleep.

413
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,240
Shall we catch an early bird,
pluck the feathers...

414
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,520
...throw it into the aucepan,
cook and eat!

415
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,760
- Where is it? Catch it, so we can eat.
- There is one right there, by the door.

416
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,240
- Come on, let's catch it!
- Yes, there is one!

417
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,280
Hurry, it is our breakfast.
Catch it, Sakine, so we can cook it.

418
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,080
Grandma! Stop it!

419
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,400
That's enough.

420
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,680
- Hasn't your dad woken up yet?
- No, he is still sleeping.

421
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,440
Is he sick or what?
He used to get up early.

422
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,800
It was a long day for him.
Let him sleep a bit more.

423
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,480
Approach me...

424
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:29,480
...why don't you go to the courtyard
until we preparethe breakfast?

425
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,560
Come on! Go to the garden and check
if the horses have had their breakfast.

426
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,000
Let's go together.

427
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:42,400
Let's see the ones which haven't had yet,
so we will bend their ears, OK?

428
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,080
Go on!

429
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,360
Run, go on!

430
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,960
Very well, sir.
All of the shoes are so firm.

431
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,120
Horses don't wear shoes.

432
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,680
Sure, they do...

433
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,360
...but you cannot see them.
- Why not?

434
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,160
- Where is Deniz, mum?
- Hush! Come here.

435
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,200
You cannot see from there,
come and look closer.

436
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,960
Where are they?

437
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,160
Still not close enough. Come closer.

438
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,160
See? These are the shoes, horse shoes.

439
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,480
- Got it know?
- Yes, you are right.

440
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,400
Iron shoes. Do you just stick them on?

441
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,440
Stick? Funny boy!

442
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,880
- We nail them.
- Doesn't it hurt?

443
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,960
No, it doesn't. No flesh there,
just a fingernail.

444
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:32,240
- What if you don't nail them?
- Lf we don't, it hurts actually.

445
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,240
Are you scared?

446
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,000
Does a man get scared of a horse?

447
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,880
No, I am not. When it neighed, I just.

448
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,520
It was just a reflex.

449
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,760
- Does it have a name?
- Name?

450
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,040
It is just a horse, no name.
You name it.

451
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,840
- Let's call it Jolly Jumper.
- Well done, little boy.

452
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,760
Where did you find this nice name?

453
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,560
It was in a comic book.
Lucky Luke's horse.

454
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,080
- Can we call it Jolly Jumper?
- Sure, we can.

455
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,720
Do you like reading?

456
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,800
I do. I like horses, too.

457
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:30,240
Who doesn't? You should come
here more often, then.

458
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,280
- Thank you, uncle.
- Uncle?

459
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,480
I am your grandpa!
Don't call me uncle.

460
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,720
But you got mad at me once,
when I called you grandpa.

461
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,760
I won't.

462
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:47,280
I am your grandpa.

463
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,720
Thank God.

464
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,960
Dad is mad again.

465
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,760
What is this? He looks as if
running away from fire.

466
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,880
Is he going to be like this just
because his son returned home?

467
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,600
I am so sorry for them.

468
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,520
Dad, where are you going?

469
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,480
It is the new boy who made
my grandpa mad.

470
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:28,600
- We don't want them here. - What
a shame! You shouldn't talk like this.

471
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,720
Oh, that's great. Come on,
get off and push it.

472
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,480
- Why did it stop again?
- That's my grandpa.

473
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,720
That's my grandpa.
His anger caused the car stopped.

474
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,240
I am not getting off, no way.
You push it!

475
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,200
Salim, I am sick of this car.
You should get rid of it.

476
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,680
Come on, son. Push it.

477
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,800
Hseyin! Push it or I'll bend your ear!

478
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,240
Come on, push. Come here, Hseyin.

479
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,640
Hanifes' are about to come.

480
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,440
Look Sadk...

481
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,560
...let's take Deniz and show him around.

482
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,880
Later, you will go
downtown to see your friends.

483
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:26,200
- They have been asking Salim about you.
- Sure, we go.

484
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,640
What was it you wanted to tell me
last night?

485
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,960
Nothing, mum.

486
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,920
OK, then. Let me know, when you
remember. Here, take it.

487
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,040
Bon appetite, grandson.

488
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:50,480
Look, how he eats so well, come on, eat
your egg or "gat gat" might get offended.

489
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,120
Gat gat gat, my egg is hot.

490
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,760
The queen is coming with her throne!

491
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,320
Welcome Hseyin Agha.
Come on in. May I offer you tea?

492
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,320
Have a nice day. No, thanks.

493
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,720
What is it, Hseyin Agha?
You look different.

494
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,200
Different?

495
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,480
You are just looking around as if you
are going to buy the whole store.

496
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,120
What a mind! You fool

497
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,000
All right, then.
Let's wait about until the evening.

498
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,800
I am going to buy some little-boy-books.
Are there any comic books?

499
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,520
Yes. Which one do you want?

500
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,800
Just give me one of each.

501
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,440
Your grandson wouldn't read these,
I guess.

502
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,440
- These are for the other one.
- For Ayegl?

503
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,800
What is she supposed to do
with these comics?

504
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,840
For the other one! What's it to you?
You mind your own business.

505
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,160
These are the books that I want, right?
Stop asking questions!

506
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,840
- Why are yelling at me?
- Just take the money.

507
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,680
All right.

508
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,720
Pack them!
Am I supposed to carry them like a kid?

509
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,160
- Do you want me to disgrace myself?
- All right.

510
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,360
Why don't sit with us?
How can you eat from there?

511
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,400
My clothes may get dirty.
I am OK here, don't interfere.

512
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,000
Don't know who she takes after.

513
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,560
My mother used to say
"she is not my daughter...

514
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,760
...I adopted her from a rich family."

515
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,440
Glbeyaz went to ladies' schools.

516
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,440
Like a flower in shit.

517
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,280
If I am that flower,
aren't you that shit, Nuran?

518
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,160
You make me speak dirty
in front of the kids.

519
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,200
- My aunt said "shit".
- What a shame!

520
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,840
Your grand aunt is a bit cracked,
my child.

521
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,760
- Where from?
- Don't provoke the kids against me!

522
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,640
Come on kids, go and pick some
grapes over there.

523
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,680
Unless your grandma feels sorry for them.

524
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:43,040
Hseyin will have sleepless nights
just because a bunch of grapes was picked.

525
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,160
I am going to tell my grandpa
that you make fun of him.

526
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:51,240
Tell him, I don't care. May the one who
is scared of your grandpa be like him.

527
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,080
- Yes, my dear?
- Your name, why is it "white rose"?

528
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,120
Because that's what I was named.

529
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,520
The boy is just confused,
when they say "white".

530
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,320
My mother was dark-skinned.

531
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,560
She wanted to have white daughters,
but we take after our mother.

532
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,560
In fact we are not that much.
We are just sun burnt.

533
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,080
Yeah, right.

534
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,160
Nuran, I am going to kill her!
I warn you!

535
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,720
- You stop it.
- Don't you feel ashamed at all?

536
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:34,640
Mum, we are going downtown with Salim.
To coffee house, I'll see my friends.

537
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,200
All right, are you satiated?

538
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,720
You stay here, play with your grandma.

539
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:45,160
- I'll see you in the evening, OK?
- Dad, can you buy me some books?

540
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,920
All right, come on Salim, let's go.

541
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,280
Let's go, your friends will be
delighted to see you.

542
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,400
That was a bad cough.

543
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,480
I wonder if you are getting
sick on this summer day.

544
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,520
I am OK.

545
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,360
- Brother.
- Yes, my precious.

546
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:11,120
- Do you remember this tree?
- Of course, I do.

547
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,880
One night you were so angry with
dad, you stayed up there till morning.

548
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:19,040
I couldn't climb to get you down, you
used to climb these trees like a monkey.

549
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,440
- Brother.
- Yes, my precious.

550
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,640
You are the greatest person
I've ever known in this world.

551
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,880
Just don't change, OK?
I love you so much.

552
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,680
Don't talk like that,
I am so sensitive.

553
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,680
- Thanks God, we are happy, right?
- Yes, we are.

554
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,280
May God keep it like this.

555
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,240
When he was at your age...

556
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:59,960
...he used to water the grapes.
- With a hose?

557
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,800
See these? With arcs.

558
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:10,680
You make the water flow from here
and give out with a hoe...

559
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,040
...so the water can pass on the others.

560
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:20,320
He was a little boy,
he was running around. He grew up.

561
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,480
- He was at your age.
- At my age?

562
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,160
I wish I could see my father
when he was at my age.

563
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,040
How can it be possible?
Those were the old times.

564
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,720
I wish there was a time machine.
We would push its button and...

565
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:39,080
...go back to my dad's childhood and
see him, that would be nice, right?

566
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,640
Sure, that would be nice and we
would seem younger, then, right?

567
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:48,520
Don't be so sarcastic.
Do you want to be a young girl, now?

568
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,280
I am still young, look who is talking!

569
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,560
You are an old woman,
but you stil wear the same clothes...

570
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,800
...you used to wear 10 years ago
to pretend to be younger.

571
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,480
You go, we will go to coffee house.
We'll meet you there.

572
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,200
- Let's buy the books Deniz wanted.
- We can buy on the way back home.

573
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,000
We buy newspaper, too.
We shouldn't forget his books...

574
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,760
...or he gets mad at me in the evening.
- Children are so likeable, right?

575
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,200
- Sure, they are.
- I like my kids and yours, too.

576
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:31,600
I am his uncle,
meaning almost his father, right?

577
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,840
Right, brother.

578
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,840
Have a nice day, Mustafa.
Look, Sadk is here.

579
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,960
Welcome Sadk. What brings you here?

580
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,880
Hello Mustafa.

581
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,840
I got it now. That's why
he kept telling "the other one".

582
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,520
Your dad bought some books to your son.

583
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,320
How should I know? When he said
"books", I couldn't imagine.

584
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:00,280
- Did my dad buy books?
- Yes, he did. You know, Texas, Tommix.

585
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,320
So many of them. For his grandson.

586
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,200
Dad bought books to your son,
did you hear it, Sadk?

587
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,840
Yeah. All right, then. Let's go.

588
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,720
Look Mustafa, he sounded like us.

589
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,760
I told you, Sadk doesn't deny
where he came from.

590
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,040
Bon app, tit, Huseyin Agha. I heard
that Sadk is here. I am happy for you.

591
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,560
- Where did you see them?
- Downtown.

592
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,120
They said they were
coming to coffee house.

593
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,640
Yes, right. He wants to see you all.
We talked about it in the morning.

594
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:40,520
Where are you going, Hseyin? You
haven't finished smoking your water pipe.

595
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,760
I have some work to do.
Your water pipe wasn't good.

596
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,920
Do you buy cheap tobacco or what?
It feels like smoking straw.

597
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,760
- What?
- Wait, dad.

598
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,440
I heard that you have bought
some books for Deniz, today. Thank you.

599
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,120
- The kid wanted.
- That's very kind of you.

600
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,240
All right, get out of my way,
go, do your job.

601
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:40,200
- I have no job, dad. I quitted my job.
- That's why you came here, then.

602
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,080
Come on, let's go the coffee house.

603
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,440
Birgl.

604
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,080
This is my day of
getting beaten up, I guess.

605
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,320
Why did you say that?

606
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,520
Forget it, come on.

607
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,120
All right, we are dead.
Go, play some where else. Don't bother us.

608
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,360
That's great. You said
he wouldn't come at that time of the day.

609
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,120
I wish I wouldn't believe you
and stay for a tea.

610
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:43,680
How should I know, sister? It is so
unusual for him to come at this time.

611
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,760
Why do you get me involved
with this sulking man?

612
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,560
Are you leaving, just because
I am here, you crazy girl?

613
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,280
Tell your husband,
I am here because kids are here.

614
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,320
Otherwise, may the devil be
with "some people".

615
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,600
- All right, I'll tell him.
- Oh, God.

616
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,080
- Like a camel's grudge!
- Look, who is talking.

617
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,320
Look, who is talking.
Are you the most peaceful man on earth?

618
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:10,080
- Do you want tea, dad?
- No. Stop it. It is so hot.

619
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:20,240
- Where is our new boy?
- He is playing with Hseyin.

620
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,440
What did you buy?

621
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:26,320
Some stuff.

622
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:34,280
Have you ever entered this room?
There is treasure in there, right?

623
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,680
Grandpa'll get angry.
Stop meddling with it.

624
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,520
What's going on?

625
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,360
If you ever get close to this door...

626
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:49,720
...I fall out with you, OK?
- You what?

627
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,240
- I mean, I will punish you.
- What is in there?

628
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,040
There are dogs like monsters.
They may eat you.

629
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,960
I got you a present. Look, here.

630
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:06,680
However, it is not going to be opened
till the evening. You are punished.

631
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,720
You are not going to meddle with this, OK?

632
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,000
- OK.
- Come on, come with me now.

633
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:28,440
Where are you, big boy? Come out.

634
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:37,040
Wow, what an appetite!

635
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:50,160
Sadk seems a bit quiet.
Does he have a problem or what?

636
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,520
I know his problem.
He had quitted his job.

637
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,760
When did you talk about it?

638
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,080
Seeking a friend.

639
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,640
We came across downtown.

640
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:08,240
The flowers in the courtyard withered,
although I water them regularly.

641
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,920
How should I know?
We get the garden disinfected.

642
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,760
Maybe it affected the flowers, too.
It is weird.

643
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,360
Seeking a friend.

644
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,480
Come over here, grandson.

645
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,920
I hope you'll like them.

646
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,160
Grandpa bought me books.

647
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:41,120
They can be yours, if you kiss me once.

648
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,040
Come on, let's read together.

649
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:51,120
You found your friend here, Deniz.
You lost your time for nothing.

650
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,240
The letters are so small.

651
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:57,560
- Shall I read you out loudly for you?
- Come on, read.

652
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,120
They look great! Well done.

653
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,040
You are a bit quiet.

654
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,400
You are right. A bit.

655
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,840
Is this a case of "urban- rural
confusion" or alienation?

656
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:40,400
Don't even try to say that, I won't
believe you. This is your hometown.

657
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,120
Hometown? Home? Fatherland?

658
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,480
Lately, I have been revising
the meanings of these words.

659
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:49,480
I always thought that
I was struggling for this country.

660
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,720
But this country wouldn't even care.

661
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,520
That's what lots of people
think these days.

662
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:04,240
We used to dream about
leaving here, remember?

663
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:09,120
You managed, I couldn't.

664
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:13,360
I want to ask you something.
At least, you tried.

665
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:20,000
For someone who was afraid to try.
Can you really say that I missed too much?

666
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,040
I am asking, because I am really
curious about it. No other reasons.

667
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,320
If you were given another chance,
after all you've lived through...

668
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:32,760
...should you stay or leave?
- I don't know.

669
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:42,200
I guess, I would take everything I have
here or bring the ones over here back.

670
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,880
Do you know what the hardest one is?
To be caught in the middle.

671
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,880
- I could neither leave nor stay.
- What are they chatting about?

672
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,760
It's an "intellectual talk",
it doesn't suit us.

673
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:00,320
Come on, intellectuals, cheers!

674
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,200
Bon appetite.

675
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,720
These are like Turkish Delight.

676
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,920
You are late.
Go to your bed, right away.

677
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:38,080
Shall I make you cofffe?
Did Salim go home?

678
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,320
Mum.

679
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,600
Take Deniz to Salims'.

680
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,960
I shouldn't have let Salim go,
he could take you with him.

681
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,960
What are you talking about?

682
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,560
Mum, please take Deniz and go,
just for tonight.

683
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,200
I am going to talk to dad
and most probably we'll argue.

684
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:04,200
Dad, I know you heard us, you hear me.

685
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,440
We need to talk.

686
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,840
I didn't come here to apologize,
because there is no reason for that.

687
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:18,640
I won't go into a discussion like
"forgive each other".

688
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:25,120
I will be in the courtyard, dad.
Get dressed and come.

689
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,480
This is very important.

690
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,480
We need to talk.

691
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:49,960
- Something wrong?
- No. Can you help mum?

692
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,160
She is near the tractor.

693
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,080
You wait here.

694
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:29,040
Uncle brahim, where are we going?

695
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,400
To uncle Salims'.
You will stay there tonight.

696
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,120
- Why? Where is my dad?
- He is there, too.

697
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:40,800
All of us will stay over there tonight.

698
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:45,680
Don't be afraid, Deniz. It is OK.
It is just a visit.

699
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:52,400
It doesn't make sense. Uncle brahim,
I think I am dreaming right now.

700
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,160
Yes, you are dreaming.

701
01:07:56,040 --> 01:08:00,800
Don't afraid, Deniz, don't afraid!

702
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,600
Deniz wasn't afraid of anything.

703
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,080
Nene Hatun and her grandson
passed through the enemy...

704
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:13,480
...front bravely with corporal brahim.

705
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:19,120
They were the super heroes
of the Independence War.

706
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:25,440
Don't be afraid.

707
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,440
- Good evening, dad.
- What evening?

708
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:40,160
Don't you aware of the time?

709
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:44,560
- It is almost morning.
- I'm sorry. This is not an appropriate time

710
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,120
The things you do are
always inappropriate.

711
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,560
Dad, let's not argue. We did that
a lot in the past. It never worked.

712
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,200
Nothing changed, as you see.

713
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:59,120
There are things we need to talk.

714
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,160
Cigarette?

715
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,440
I don't smoke that one, it makes me cough.

716
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,360
Dad, you don't know why I am back.

717
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:23,280
Actually, there shouldn't have been any
reason, I should have just come back,

718
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:25,880
But it didn't happen that way.

719
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:33,200
My name is Sadk,
my brother's name is Salim.

720
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,360
So what? My name is Hseyin.

721
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:40,560
Why did you give us these names, dad?

722
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:44,360
Were you that much scared of us,
right from the beginning?

723
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:49,400
Did you want to manage our lives that
much? When I wanted to find my own way.

724
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,440
That way of yours.

725
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:01,680
We sent you stanbul to study
agriculture, not to become an anarchist.

726
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:06,920
That's what I was just about to say, dad.
You sent me to study agriculture.

727
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:11,000
No other choice.
Become an engineer, manage the farm...

728
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,120
...to stay here and get married to Birgl.

729
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,520
You chose my school,
my life, my everything, dad.

730
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:20,000
Do you know that I hate that, dad?

731
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,280
You are calling me selfish, right?

732
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,880
You mentioned Birgl.

733
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,200
After you left, have you ever thought
of that girl, how she suffered?

734
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:38,600
Her tears didn't stop for years and you
are calling me selfish, give me a break!

735
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:47,280
Dad, you said "you left", but I didn't.
I couldn't. I couldn't stay though.

736
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,600
I couldn't recognize where my home is.

737
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:56,760
Somewhere in my mind
you have always tried to lead me.

738
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:02,800
Our arguments and matters between us.

739
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:07,560
Do you have any idea what it means to
have no home to come back, dad?

740
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,040
However, everything got even worse.
My wife died.

741
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:14,440
My revolutionist friends, who used to
call me "petty bourgeois" at the time...

742
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,240
...gave me jobs in advertisement agencies,
capitalist papers, taking pity on me.

743
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,520
Like throwing a bone to a dog.

744
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:24,320
In order to clear themselves,
in order to clean their souls!

745
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:29,360
Wait, I am getting out of the subject.

746
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:36,040
I was talking about "home".

747
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,680
Do you know why I returned, dad?

748
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,160
Give a room to Deniz?

749
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:48,680
Let him grow up here,
let him have a home.

750
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,360
He has nowhere else to go.

751
01:11:54,840 --> 01:12:00,280
Did you get now, what it means
to have a child? It is hard, isn't it?

752
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:04,920
You aren't able to look after him, right?

753
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:10,040
- You see what it means to have a child?
- Sure I see.

754
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:18,400
Do you have any idea about not
to be able to see a child's growing up?

755
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:22,000
Do you know that feeling?

756
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:26,480
The life will go on...

757
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:31,040
Some people will write new books,
you won't be able to read them.

758
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:34,000
New films will be shot,
you won't be able to see them.

759
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:38,440
You will want to listen again some song
you like, but you won't able to do it.

760
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,320
Maybe you'll get used to
these things, easily...

761
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:47,120
While he is growing up, not be beside him.

762
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:51,600
Not to be able to see his first
girlfriend.

763
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,520
Dad...

764
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,280
...my heart is in flames.

765
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,600
I guess, this is a feeling like leaving
something left undone.

766
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,600
Recently, I've been trying to
push him away when he hugs me.

767
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:12,440
I have been trying my best to
keep him away from me.

768
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:20,000
I hate myself for
being a pain in his life.

769
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,560
Give him a room, dad.

770
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:34,680
Let him have a home,
but he could leave time to time.

771
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:42,880
There are so many things that
I wanted to tell him. You tell him.

772
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,160
Tell him that.

773
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:00,560
My son. What happened?

774
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,040
Where are you?

775
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:20,440
Hold it! I am coming!

776
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,680
- Come over here, sister.
- What happened? Where is Sadk?

777
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:46,840
- They got him in a room.
- Dad is talking to the doctor.

778
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,120
He said "don't tire him". We'll be able
to see him after a few minutes.

779
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,200
He is getting oxygen.

780
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,920
- What is wrong with him? What did they
say? - We don't know. We'll find out soon.

781
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:59,080
Come on Salim, don't.
Let's go to the garden.

782
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:03,440
Stop it, it doesn't necessarily mean
something bad. Don't let yourself go.

783
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:08,360
- Where are the kids?
- They are at home with Sakine.

784
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:12,440
We didn't tell them. We said
we were going to downtown, shopping.

785
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:16,800
He figured that something is wrong,
but didn't ask anything.

786
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:27,560
Let's go down to the caf,
we can't talk here.

787
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,160
I can't wait till there. Say it.

788
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:35,400
Don't confuse me. The doctor said
so many things, I have to clear my mind.

789
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,600
- I hope he'll get well soon, Hseyin.
- Thank you.

790
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,840
Sadk took out his health report from
his pocket...

791
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:57,320
...and gave it to us.

792
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:13,400
He was carrying in his pocket.

793
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:20,760
He has spent some time in prison,
you know.

794
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,280
During the military coup,
after Deniz was born.

795
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,640
He became ill there.

796
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:37,560
The doctor said, because of the torture
and prison conditions.

797
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,360
There is liquid accumulation
in his lungs. An edema.

798
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:51,480
It got better for a while.
A few years ago it came back.

799
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,640
One of his lungs is already damaged.

800
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:03,680
The other one He was getting
his treatment there, in stanbul.

801
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,240
He was getting medicines.

802
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:13,120
This is the case.

803
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,680
The doctor said
he would do his best, but...

804
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:24,520
...there is little hope.

805
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,280
He told me to get prepare for the worse.

806
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,920
Salim, pull yourself together.

807
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:40,360
If you'll be like this near the kid
Pull yourself together, what a shame!

808
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:43,880
How can I, dad?
My brother is dying, what are you saying?

809
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,480
It's very kind of you to come here, Fatma.

810
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,720
Both the kid and Sadk
have been asking about you.

811
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:24,160
I intended to come earlier,
but it took too much time to.

812
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,200
Take the kids to the village,
to my sisters'.

813
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:31,760
- Where were you born, Fatma?
- Kayseri.

814
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,160
Some of my relatives are still there.
But we are very much apart of each other.

815
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:38,520
Some of us are in stanbul,
some of us are there.

816
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,360
That's the way it is.

817
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,720
Come on, dad. Take over them!

818
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,760
- Don't intervene.
- You are treading on my toes.

819
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,520
- Don't hit me!
- Stop it! It may be an accident.

820
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:54,760
That's enough. Stop the car, Salim.
Let's throw the kids out of the car.

821
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,320
Be quiet, kids.

822
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:02,200
I am going to cry that here is a fire.
I wish I would go with the others.

823
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:08,800
I am sweating.
Sakine, what a big hip you have.

824
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:14,080
- Move a side a bit.
- It's the kids, what I can do?

825
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,400
Stop the car, Salim.

826
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:24,400
Why did you stop? What is it,
is it the car again? Why did you stop?

827
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,280
I don't know.
All of you told me to stop and

828
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,320
Go on, move it. Why did you stop?

829
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:35,320
Hseyin, Ayegl, what happened to you?

830
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:40,960
If they make any noise, I'll call the
doctors to give them an injection.

831
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:44,760
They are afraid of doctors.

832
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,760
Let's go outside.

833
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,640
Is this room hot for you, son?

834
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:54,080
No, it is OK. It is cool in the evenings.
It is slept well here.

835
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,480
- The wind blows from here.
- Do you stay here, too?

836
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:01,120
Sometimes me, sometimes his mother.
We manage it in some way.

837
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:10,120
- You wanted these from home.
- Thanks.

838
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,480
Please put them into that drawer.

839
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:17,880
Fatma will stay with us, right?
We won't let her go.

840
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:21,840
I can't stay long. The schools will be
opened soon, I have some work to do.

841
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,200
There is still time for the schools.

842
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:29,440
Dad, will I go to school here?

843
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,680
Yes, Deniz. Is it bad?

844
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:38,960
No, it is even better.
You'll get better until that time, right?

845
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,520
The schools will be opened
a month later, right?

846
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,560
Yes, but you'll get better, right?

847
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,760
Sure, I will.

848
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:52,400
Your wife was a beautiful woman.
May God bless her soul.

849
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:56,320
Look at this, Deniz is so small here.

850
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:00,560
Had you taken this picture with you
to stanbul?

851
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,960
I was wondering where it was.

852
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,440
When you first came here,
you know we went to the vineyard.

853
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:11,240
Deniz said "I wish I could see
my father wandering around.

854
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:13,680
When he was a child,
I wish there was a time machine.

855
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:18,080
- We would push the button".
- Really? Look at that little rascal!

856
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:22,680
- Bring me water from downstairs.
- There is water here. Shall I give you?

857
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,880
- I want another one from downstairs.
- It is water, dad. They are all the same.

858
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,000
Brother, bring it from downstairs.

859
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:50,800
Once you said something to me.
About Deniz.

860
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:55,360
You told that you had some things
you couldn't say to Deniz.

861
01:21:56,040 --> 01:22:00,480
I have some things
I couldn't say to you, as well.

862
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:05,040
I am not good at making a speech.

863
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:10,280
You are my son...

864
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,640
...my everything.

865
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:20,280
That's all I am saying.

866
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:23,880
I understood, dad.
I understood very well, thank you.

867
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:31,920
You said once, "I wish
he didn't see me in bed like this".

868
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,600
Don't worry.

869
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:43,760
Sons remember their dads
just the way they want...

870
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,680
...right, Sadk?

871
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,560
Good morning.

872
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,760
Good morning, uncle Hseyin.

873
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,760
Is your husband at home?

874
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:05,040
No, he went to zmir.
We'll get our garden disinfected.

875
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,560
- He won't return till the evening, right?
- Yes, I guess so.

876
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,400
I have a request.

877
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:37,480
Open your mouth, come on.

878
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,520
I can eat by myself, brother.
Give me that.

879
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:42,440
Why would I? You don't eat, then.
You are cheating me.

880
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,280
Look, that fat nurse
is complaining about you.

881
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:47,480
Open your mouth.

882
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:50,600
You have a visitor.

883
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,920
I hope you'll get well soon.

884
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:02,440
Come on, go outside, to the garden.

885
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:08,160
Not before he finishes his soup.
The fat nurse is very angry.

886
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:13,800
Do you remember the time
when I was in primary school and...

887
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:17,360
...you were junior high school?
One day I had made some raisin cookies.

888
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:20,240
I was taking them to the school.

889
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:23,640
You had tasted one of them
and liked so much.

890
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:27,160
- You hadn't even believe that I made it.
- So?

891
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:33,080
I brought you those cookies. Eat it,
I wonder if you'll remember the taste.

892
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,680
I never forgot.

893
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:44,200
Didn't you? I didn't, either.

894
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,600
- You don't seem to be changed at all.
- I have changed.

895
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,240
How wouldn't I change?

896
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:56,840
- You are married with Mehmet, right?
- Yes, sure, I had.

897
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,640
How wouldn't I get married?

898
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,840
We heard about your wife.
We felt very sorry.

899
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:11,120
Well done.
We appreciated you so much.

900
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,680
You raised your child on your own.
You didn't need anyone.

901
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,120
You have two, right?

902
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,600
Yes, indeed.

903
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:29,120
It is delicious. Did you make it
right before you came here?

904
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:32,600
No, I had some at home.
My sons like it.

905
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:41,960
I wanted to name to
one of the boys after you.

906
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,400
But I was afraid that Mehmet might
realize and get angry with me.

907
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:50,400
We named him Caner,
but I always call him Sadk in my mind.

908
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,280
I wanted you to know this.

909
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:01,760
Did you forgive me?

910
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:08,200
Sure, I did, Sadk.
How wouldn't I forgive you?

911
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:51,240
The cars are coming. What should we do?

912
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:54,960
They'll all cry now,
maybe you should take away the kid.

913
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:57,360
I am sure they will control themselves
while the child is here.

914
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,000
Come on,
let's go to the field all together.

915
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,800
And make you a wooden horse, OK?

916
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:46,160
If I stood like this...

917
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,480
...right here.

918
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:52,200
If I opened my arms like this...

919
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:56,360
If I stopped him.

920
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,920
If I stopped him.

921
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:05,040
If I told him not to go.

922
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,680
15 years ago...

923
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:17,920
...if I stood like this,
Nuran If I stopped Sadk.

924
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,840
Get your arms down.

925
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,600
For God's sake, pull yourself together.

926
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:27,040
If I hugged him like this...

927
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:31,680
...if I told my son not to go.

928
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:35,880
Don't. You are our father.

929
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:44,040
Look, we have a grandson,
pull yourself together.

930
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:47,640
He wouldn't leave, then.

931
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,520
He would stay.

932
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:58,160
I wish I had said nothing.
I wish I had kept my mouth shut.

933
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:05,240
I brought about his death!

934
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:26,040
- I couldn't stop him.
- Uncle Hseyin, please stop it.

935
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,960
Stand right here!

936
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,680
Open your arms!
I said "open your arms".

937
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,680
Sister, are you mad?

938
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:53,520
Come with me.

939
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,280
Move!

940
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:09,000
Run towards your dad.
Run. Break through him.

941
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:17,240
If you don't, your dad will never get
well for all his life. Run!

942
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:24,320
Catch him. Stop him!

943
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:28,280
Dad.

944
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:39,360
I am coming, dad! Get out of my way!

945
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:59,600
You see? No one can stop the one
who wants to leave.

946
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:06,360
Oh, no! Salim!

947
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:11,600
It is all right. You ran and
it is over. Come back here!

948
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:16,920
He is running towards the river.
He may fall in and drown!

949
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:20,160
Look how his uniform suits him!

950
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,680
- Let me get your collar.
- Don't move!

951
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:30,000
- You tightened so much.
- But you are going to be so pretty.

952
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:34,000
Very well, they all look pretty.
Let's put your handkerchiefs...

953
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:37,200
...into your pockets so that
they don't call you snotty.

954
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:41,840
These are the presents from your aunt,
Glbeyaz, for your primary school day.

955
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,720
I mean, for your first school day.

956
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:50,480
"Primary school day" sounded like
"primary school".

957
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:56,480
I meant "the first day of school".
What am I saying? You made me confused.

958
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,800
Aunt Glbeyaz, grandpa gave us money,
but you gave us handkerchiefs.

959
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:04,920
I am not rich as much as your
grandpa, my child.

960
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:08,680
Sure, not as much as me.
She was going to say "as much as Croesus".

961
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,600
But she got confused, I guess.

962
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,120
Who is Croesus?

963
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:17,200
There is a scorpion in your aunt's
pocket. She is afraid to be stung by it.

964
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:22,280
Don't laugh Nuran. Otherwise
I will never come to your house again.

965
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:27,120
- I swear, I will never come here again.
- I didn't laugh, sister. You misunderstood

966
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:31,440
Come on, line up. We'll take photos.
"Brahim, you do that.

967
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,200
I wish we tidied ourselves up a little,
we'll seem ugly.

968
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:41,000
- You are OK, mum, come here.
- Come on, Glbeyaz.

969
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:46,560
- You do it, I don't want.
- Come here, girl! Don't act like a child.

970
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:05,640
Ready!

971
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,880
- Dad, who is Croesus?
- How should I know?

972
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,680
- I guess, he was one of the kings.
- How is the grandson?

973
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,920
He has to get used to it.

974
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:25,080
We are trying best to
make him feel better.

975
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:28,360
He has talked only a few words
last 4 weeks, though.

976
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:33,160
It should be better for him
if he cried, screamed, let it go.

977
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,680
He is like a small bird
fallen down from nest.

978
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,840
We are so afraid to say anything.

979
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:40,640
They said it's psychological, he has
just closed himself to the world outside.

980
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:44,240
I don't know for which one
I should be sorry. Him or my son?

981
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:56,600
Deniz, let's go.

982
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:04,000
- My son!
- My grandson!

983
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:09,400
What is it, my dear?

984
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,520
I missed my dad so much.

985
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:27,320
Don't be sorry. Look, we are here,
your siblings are here.

986
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:37,080
Hseyin, Ayegl, your grand aunt.

987
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:43,600
We are all here.

988
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:47,320
You don't have to go to school today.

989
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:51,920
Teachers wouldn't give homework,
this is the first day of school.

990
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:56,880
Look, you'll have new friends there,
they'll like you so much.

991
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:04,800
Look, there are horses here.

992
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:09,880
We can drive tractor,
I can teach you how to it.

993
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:18,160
Actually, do you know that
people don't die?

994
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,840
God takes them to his side.

995
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:24,880
We call them "dead", but...

996
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:28,400
...they actually wait for us in the sky.

997
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,080
- Right, grandpa?
- Sure.

998
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:35,680
Then, one day we'll all meet up there.

999
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:40,040
Your dad'll be there, too.

1000
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:43,280
All of us will be there.

1001
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:47,560
We'll look down from the skies.

1002
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:50,880
You are lying. No one will fly.

1003
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:57,440
Of course, we won't fly with our wings.
I mean some other form.

1004
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:02,320
Why would we lie to you?
Look, he doesn't believe us.

1005
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:07,120
We read a book together, remember?
You call it comics.

1006
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:12,840
The guy was flying, don't you believe
him, either? What was it?

1007
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:19,720
Right. Your dad became Superman.

1008
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:25,040
- He is flying in the skies.
- I want him to come down.

1009
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,280
I don't want him to fly.
I want him here.

1010
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:37,360
Come with me, then.
I'll show you your dad.

1011
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:48,480
- Grandpa. We entered the secret room.
- Yes, we did. Wait here, it's dark.

1012
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:53,800
Look, Deniz, one of our neighbor
has gone to Germany to work.

1013
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,160
His name is Osman.

1014
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:59,880
Look at this.

1015
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:04,240
- A projection machine!
- Right, there is a film in it, actually.

1016
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:06,560
Let's watch it.

1017
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:16,160
Your grandpa asked Osman to bring a
projection machine.

1018
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:20,720
Grandpa shot all of us.

1019
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:23,640
Look, like this.

1020
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:32,760
I used to be a director in the past.

1021
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:36,560
Come on, the film is about to start.
Did you get your tickets?

1022
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,760
- Do you have any money?
- Yes.

1023
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:44,240
We have and we have a lot,
you just gave us. Two for me.

1024
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:48,840
Don't pay, my child. He is fooling you.

1025
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:51,520
Grandpa the director,
don't get any money from us.

1026
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:54,480
All right, then.
Only for this time it is free.

1027
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:59,000
- I'll get her money, though.
- Forget it, you nuts!

1028
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:04,320
- Didn't you leave?
- No, we didn't.

1029
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:07,240
They wanted to return on the way.

1030
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:11,680
- There is a projection machine!
- Come on, don't stand by the door.

1031
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:14,920
Let's all seat.

1032
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:47,360
That's my dad!

1033
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,560
It is a silent movie.

1034
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,080
Dad!

1035
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:01,680
Take it, it's yours.
Don't tell anyone, OK?

1036
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,720
You can shoot movies with this.

1037
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,400
- Dad.
- My son!

1038
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:48,280
Did you come out of this?

1039
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:53,720
- Are you going to school?
- Yes, did you see me?

1040
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:57,200
- Grandma says that you can see us.
- Yes.

1041
01:44:57,640 --> 01:45:01,440
Your uniform suits you so much.
You were very handsome as usual.

1042
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:04,760
- Were you here?
- Yes.

1043
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:14,240
Dad, am I dreaming again?

1044
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:19,480
I don't know, but even if you are,
it is nice, right?

1045
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:23,080
Why aren't you Superman, then?

1046
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:25,720
Because you have grown up.

1047
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:29,360
When a person grows up,
do his dreams get smaller?

1048
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:35,600
I won't be able to see you again, right?

1049
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:39,400
You can see me, if you want.

1050
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:43,560
Yes, maybe none of them
will be that real like it is now.

1051
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:47,320
Because you'll know that
you create them in your mind.

1052
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:52,080
Yet maybe they'll be even nicer, then.
You can direct them as you like.

1053
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:54,920
You can try to make them real.

1054
01:45:55,280 --> 01:46:00,200
- This means growing up, right?
- Yes, handsome. This means growing up.

1055
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:05,600
- I wish I'd never grow up.
- Why is that?

1056
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:11,600
- I won't able to see you again, then.
- You'll grow up, you have to grow up.

1057
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:16,040
When you grow up, you won't need
to see me, you won't need me.

1058
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:22,760
Come on, get into the house.
It's going to rain.

1059
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:24,680
Will you get wet?

1060
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:31,320
No, I won't and I'll always be happy,
because you have a home, handsome.

1061
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:40,920
Are you leaving?

1062
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:48,640
Look, let's play a game with you.
Get the camera and shoot me walking.

1063
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:53,920
There is no film in it.

1064
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:59,240
Yes, there is. I put it.
Come on, shoot me.

1065
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:37,760
Bye dad.

1066
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:42,480
Deniz made a promise to his dad
while he was saying goodbye to him.

1067
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:45,960
He would grow up and never cry.

1068
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:51,240
Because he had a superhero dad
even if he doesn't fly in the skies.

1069
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:57,320
Deniz let the superhero leave, because
new adventures were waiting for him.

1070
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:00,880
These happy ending stories
should be told to others.
