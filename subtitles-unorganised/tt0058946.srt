INTERNATIONAL FILM
CRITICS AWARD 1966

00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,744
AWARD FROM
THE CITY OF VENICE 1966

4
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,853
Couldn't you have talked sooner?

5
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,516
It would've gone easier for you.

6
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,199
He finally came clean.

7
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,004
Give him some coffee.

8
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,872
Don't worry.

9
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,645
Drink this.
You'll feel better.

10
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,648
Don't take it so hard, fella.

11
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,396
At ease.

12
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:46,605
Is it true?
- Looks like it. 3 rue des Abderames.

13
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,033
Get him dressed.

14
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,675
Buck up.

15
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:55,075
It's all over now.
Just one last little effort.

16
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,473
Can you stand?

17
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,047
Let go of him.

18
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:03,055
Here, put this on.

19
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,294
It'll suit you fine.

20
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:16,026
We're going to the Casbah now.
They won't recognize you in that.

21
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,431
Show us Ali La Pointe's hideout.

22
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,565
Then you'll be free.

23
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,105
Give him a cap and dress him.

24
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:24,970
You're inducted!

25
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:26,743
Cut the clowning, Lagloy!

26
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,954
Let's go.

27
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,700
Knock it off!
Wanna go through another round?

28
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,233
Quit fooling around.
Pull yourself together.

29
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:02,177
THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS

30
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,874
Maybe they don't know we're here.

31
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:58,046
Ali La Pointe, the house
is surrounded. It's useless.

32
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:03,557
Give yourselves up.
Let the boy and the woman out first.

33
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:07,197
Then the other man with you.
After that, you come out.

34
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,168
Leave your weapons behind.

35
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,596
No tricks. You're done for.

36
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,670
We have you covered.
You don't have a chance. Got that?

37
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,370
You hear me, Ali?

38
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,813
Listen good! You're the last one.
It's all over.

39
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,818
The organization's finished.

40
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,689
Everyone's dead or in prison.

41
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,055
If you come out now,
you'll get a fair trial.

42
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,390
Make up your mind!

43
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,605
THE EUROPEAN QUARTER

44
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:15,800
National Liberation ront (LN),
Communiqu No. 1

45
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:19,904
People of Algeria, our combat
is directed against colonialism.

46
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:24,200
Our aim independence and
restoration of the Algerian state,

47
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,471
in accordance with Islamic principles
and the respect of basic liberties,

48
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,376
regardless of race or religion.

49
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,576
To avoid bloodshed, we propose
that the rench authorities

50
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:40,152
negotiate with us
our right to self-determination.

51
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,121
Algerians, it is your duty to save
your country and restore its liberty.

52
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,229
Its victory will be yours.

53
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:52,166
Orward, brothers! Unite!
The LN calls you to arms.

54
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,402
Ladies and gents, place your bets.

55
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,833
This loses, this loses...

56
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,973
Ace wins.

57
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,817
500 francs.

58
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,514
Your turn, madam.

59
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,028
Ace wins, this one loses.

60
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:20,921
He's always there!

61
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,076
- What's his big hurry?
- Stop him.

62
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,554
Bash the bastard's head in!

63
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:04,973
Omar, Ali.

64
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,777
Alias Ali La Pointe.
Born January 15, 1930, in Miliana.

65
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,041
Illiterate.

66
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:16,219
Occupation laborer, bricklayer, boxer.
Currently unemployed.

67
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,650
Military status draft dodger.

68
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,258
1942, Algiers Juvenile Court,

69
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:25,988
one year in reformatory

00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:33,430

73
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:43,047

a police officer on duty.

74
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:50,873
Allah is great!

75
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,656
Long live Algeria!

76
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,191
Long live Algeria!

77
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,111
Shut up! There he is.

78
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,617
Keep quiet.

79
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:26,706
FIVE MONTHS LATER

80
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:12,952
Beat it!

81
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,151
"Men have two faces.
One smiles, the other cries."

82
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,487
They sent you?

83
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,788
Yes, they sent me.

84
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,159
Here.

85
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,098
Wait!

86
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,035
Come back here.

87
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,437
Know how to read?
- Sure.

88
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,472
Read it to me.

89
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:38,379
"There's a Moorish caf
on rue Randon, in the Casbah.

90
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:43,054
Merabi, the owner,
is a police informer.

91
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:47,883
Every afternoon at 5:00,
a French policeman stops by.

92
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:54,629
He stays a few minutes, long enough
to drink a coffee and get information.

93
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,392
Then he leaves.
You are to kill the policeman."

94
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:01,606
- Not Merabi?
- No, the policeman.

95
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,096
Okay.

96
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,906
"You can't go wrong.

97
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:11,981
Right next to the caf
you'll see a girl with a basket.

98
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,816
You'll both follow the policeman.

99
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:19,354
At the right moment,
she'll hand you a revolver.

100
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,355
You just have to pull the trigger."

101
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,447
Let go of me!

102
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,051
Watch me, brothers!

103
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,019
So, you're afraid now!

104
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:56,125
Look how the organization
deals with traitors.

105
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:25,551
- You bitch! You set me up.
- Careful, the police!

106
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:33,821
- Now explain!
- If they don't catch us first.

107
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,500
Who sent you?
Take me to him.

108
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,293
- He's waiting.
- Where?

109
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,337
You'll see, if we don't get caught.

110
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:01,357
You go first.
I'll be right behind you.

111
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:09,427
What if you were a traitor?
We had to be sure.

112
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:14,334
- The gun was empty.
- Say you'd been a police spy,

113
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:19,475
the FLN contacts you in prison,
you pretend to be for the cause,

114
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,543
and the French let you escape.

115
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,142
Then they shoot me?

116
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,943
Blanks.

117
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,052
You escape, go to the address
the FLN gives you in prison,

118
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,085
and infiltrate us.

119
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,518
And who are you?

120
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,785
Jaffar. El-hadi Jaffar.

121
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,291
To join us you had to do a job.

122
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,829
If I'd told you to kill
the bar owner, an Algerian,

123
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:49,837
the cops would've let you kill him
even though he's a stoolie.

124
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,373
It wouldn't have proved your loyalty.

125
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,542
If I told you to kill the cop,

126
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,009
the French
would never have allowed it.

127
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:03,051
If you had been one of them,
you wouldn't have done it.

128
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,322
But I didn't kill him.

129
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:10,123
No, but you tried.
That's the important thing.

130
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,189
You didn't trust me!

131
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,730
Come on, don't get excited.

132
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:18,670
I said to shoot him in the back.

133
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:19,995
No way!

134
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,803
You still don't understand.

135
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,409
Explain it better.

136
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,546
Okay, I'll explain.

137
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,616
First, we need to get organized

138
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,943
and secure our hideouts.

139
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,913
Then we can take action.

140
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,019
The organization's getting stronger,

141
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:45,789
but there are still too many
drunks, whores, junkies,

142
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,993
people who talk too much,
people ready to sell us out.

143
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,963
We must win them over
or eliminate them.

144
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:57,335
We need to clean house first,
organize the country.

145
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:01,477
Only then can we take on
our real enemy. You understand, Ali?

146
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,408
APRIL 1956

147
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,541
National Liberation ront,

148
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:08,512
Communiqu No. 24

149
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,848
People of Algeria,
the Colonial Administration

150
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:16,152
is responsible not only
for impoverishing our people

151
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:21,389
but also for corrupting and degrading
our brothers and sisters,

152
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,227
who have lost their sense of dignity.

153
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,870
The LN is leading a campaign
to eradicate this scourge

154
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:31,338
and requests the population's help
and cooperation.

155
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:35,377
This is the first step
towards independence.

156
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:43,018
As of today, the LN
assumes responsibility

157
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,879
for the physical and moral well-being
of the Algerian people

158
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,253
and has therefore decided

159
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:52,259
to ban the sale and use
of all drugs and alcoholic beverages

160
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,557
and to ban
prostitution and procuring.

161
00:18:55,834 --> 00:19:00,703
Offenders will be punished. Repeat
offenders will be sentenced to death.

162
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,135
Wino! Wino!

163
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,331
Don't you know
drugs are forbidden?

164
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,398
- Why?
- Don't do it again.

165
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,261
Have you seen Hassan El-Blidi?

166
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,539
You seen Hassan El-Blidi?
Tell him I'm looking for him.

167
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,411
Seen Hassan?

168
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:34,426
If you see Hassan El-Blidi,
tell him I'm looking for him.

169
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,767
Ali, where've you been?

170
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,964
- Is Hassan here?
- He left very early. Need something?

171
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:47,145
If you see him,
tell him I'm looking for him.

172
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,779
Ali! How're you doing?

173
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:59,081
Stay there. Don't move.

174
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,882
- Take it easy.
- I told you not to move.

175
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,386
What are you afraid of?

176
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:05,791
I fear only God.

177
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,465
What's all this about?

178
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,259
There's nothing between us.

179
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,231
We're friends.
Have you forgotten?

180
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:15,935
We were friends.

181
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,341
What's happened to you?

182
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:19,805
You're sentenced to death.

183
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,278
Now I understand.

184
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,717
You've sentenced me to death.

185
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,524
What are they paying you?

186
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,421
Only one thing can save you.

187
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,620
You've been warned twice.
This is your last warning.

188
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,032
What do you mean?

189
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,162
Work for the FLN.

190
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,127
Get lost!

191
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:55,375
Don't try it! Take a good look.
Things will change in the Casbah.

192
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:58,242
Take a good look.
We'll clean this place up.

193
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,246
Now beat it!

194
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,918
And watch yourselves.

195
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:10,487
JUNE 10, 1956

196
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:20,228
Stay outside and keep watch.

197
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,079
Everything all right?
- Fine.

198
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,849
Be seated.

199
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,389
Be seated.

200
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:52,060
We'll skip the formalities.
You know why.

201
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:57,838
The day will come when we will have
our weddings in the open.

202
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,978
Remember, we are at war
against colonialism.

203
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:06,376
A strong army has occupied
our country for 130 years.

204
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:12,752
This is why the LN
has to make decisions

205
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:16,757
concerning the civil life
of the Algerian people.

206
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:21,696
With this marriage
we fulfill our duty,

207
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,834
a duty of resistance.

208
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,980
And now,
Mahmud and Fatiha,

209
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:38,909
come forward.

210
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,717
Sign here.

211
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:53,029
May God grant you good fortune.
Sign here.

212
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,832
On behalf of the FLN,
my sincerest congratulations.

213
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:04,837
Make yourselves comfortable.

214
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:51,213
JUNE 20, 1956 - 10:32 A. M.

215
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,184
Come here!

216
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,995
What is it? Calm down.

217
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:37,958
Come in here.

218
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,998
Hey, Antoine...

219
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,768
Take them in to see the captain.

220
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:02,280
Yes, sir, but they didn't get
a search warrant.

221
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,919
Rue d'Isly?

222
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:09,422
They followed them some distance
but then lost them.

223
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:15,066
Of course, sir,
but that's in your precinct.

224
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,697
It's not their job.

225
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,771
Rue Marengo?
We do have some suspects.

226
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,376
The DA first demands
an official request.

227
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,569
Yes, sir.

228
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,408
But I don't have enough men.

229
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,913
I understand.

230
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,587
But if you could...

231
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,084
The prefect can't.

232
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,122
But couldn't you...?

233
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,817
Okay.

234
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:47,022
They can slaughter all of us!

235
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:50,623
Right.

236
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:58,942
3:00 p. M:
Attempted attack against a patrol.

237
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,144
Location: Rue Luciani.
Weapon: 7.65mm revolver.

238
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:07,013
4:00 p. M:
Attack on territorial guard,

239
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:12,121
intersection of rue Consulaire
and Avenue Gnral Laquire.

240
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,793
For Paris, the solution is to put
Algiers under tight police control,

241
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:29,633
guard police stations,
close off streets.

242
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,570
I don't agree.

243
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:38,309
So, Corbire, where were we?

244
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,213
"Intersection of rue Consulaire
and Avenue Gnral Laquire."

245
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,330
The governor general decrees

246
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:06,067
Article 1 Purchase of medication
for the treatment of gunshot wounds

247
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,441
must be authorized
by the prefecture.

248
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:14,479
Article 2
Health care institutions

249
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:18,083
must keep the police informed

250
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:23,159
of all wounded patients
admitted for treatment.

251
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,439
Rom the prefecture of Algiers

252
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:44,477
In recent days, dozens of attacks
have taken place in the city.

253
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,714
The perpetrators are known
to come from the Muslim quarters.

254
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:54,649
Each time, they quickly find refuge
in these areas.

255
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:59,124
Consequently, to restore order,

256
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:03,131
the prefect has decided
to seal off the Arab quarters.

257
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,400
Checkpoints will be set up
at all access points.

258
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:11,471
Civilians must show ID
and may be subject to searches.

259
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,175
In line!

260
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:24,622
- Going back to the barracks?
- No, I've got two more days.

261
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,494
Don't touch me!

262
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,924
Keep your hands off me!

263
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:39,463
Never touch their women.

264
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:46,637
JULY 20, 1956 - 11:20 A. M.

265
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,625
What are you up to?

266
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,831
I'm meeting friends at the beach.

267
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,878
- You still there?
- This is my route.

268
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,650
Come here.

269
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,194
Beat it.

270
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,616
You go that way!
You, this way!

271
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:18,120
Same old story!
It's the government's fault.

272
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,957
What do they care?

273
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:25,566
Murder all the bastards!
Then we'll have some peace!

274
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:26,862
There he is!

275
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,532
I'm sure it's him!

276
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:31,769
- Where?
- Down there.

277
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,904
Get him!

278
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,677
Murderer! Murderer!

279
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:41,110
He looks like a dirty fellagha!

280
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,685
Where are you headed?

281
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:48,083
- Filthy Arab!
- Don't let him get away!

282
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:51,557
He's getting away! Stop him!

283
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,529
I saw him!

284
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,230
Stop him!

285
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,496
He's getting away!

286
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:24,427
Culprit Laknan Abdullah.

287
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:30,859
Laborer, married, three children.
Address: 8 rue de Thbes.

288
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:37,166
How many today?
- Seven attacks, three dead.

289
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:43,275
One copy for the prefect,
the press, the archives and for you.

290
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,278
Thanks. Night, Corbire.

291
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,075
Good night, sir.

292
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,151
Say, Corbire...

293
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,156
where's rue de Thbes?

294
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,422
In the upper Casbah, I think.

295
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,755
Good night, Mommy.

296
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,889
Good night, children.

297
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:05,499
Fatma, why aren't they in bed?

298
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:08,135
They're just on their way.

299
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,368
We must get going.

300
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:13,667
What's your hurry?
You and your card games!

301
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:17,347
Can't you play here?

302
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:22,108
- One more for the road?
- Sure, one more.

303
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:25,921
Sorry, we're already late.

304
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:30,425
Good night everyone.
Hurry up.

305
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:34,597
Good-bye, Lucien.
Don't keep Henri up too late.

306
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,302
Get in back.

307
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,023
- Is it far?
- We're almost there.

308
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:21,177
- Can we go through?
- Too late.

309
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:25,339
Curfew's already started.

310
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,149
Let us through. He's with me.

311
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:31,679
Very well, sir. Go on through.

312
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,048
- No. 8, right?
- Yes. Make it snappy.

313
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:01,520
Murderers! Murderers!

314
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,753
Ali! Stop!

315
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:56,683
Jaffar says you must stop.

316
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:59,685
Listen to me, Ali.
Don't go down there.

317
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,958
The army will slaughter us.

318
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,616
Listen to me.
- Get out of here!

319
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:06,461
Halt!

320
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:23,470
Stay calm!
The FLN will avenge you!

321
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:25,841
The FLN will avenge you!

322
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,423
Stand guard on the roof.
You, come in.

323
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:23,027
- Is this all right?
- Fine.

324
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,294
Fine.

325
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,430
No good? Listen.

326
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:33,002
I'll take my son. It'll work.

327
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:39,505
Okay, but use the rue du Divan
checkpoint. It's easier there.

328
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:41,548
Then meet up with the others.

329
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:49,986
Air France, rue Mauritania.

330
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,622
The caf, rue Michelet.

331
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:00,267
The milk bar, rue d'Isly.

332
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:02,567
The bomb timers are short.

333
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,366
They'll be set outside the Casbah.

334
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:08,306
Taleb is waiting for you
at the fish market.

335
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:14,645
But then you must hurry.
You only have 30 minutes to place them.

336
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:19,579
Good luck.

337
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:22,989
Good luck.

338
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,420
God be with you.

339
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:44,309
Halt!

340
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:57,917
- Your papers.
- I forgot them.

341
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,790
- Over there. Move it!
- They're at home.

342
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,298
Let me go get them!

343
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:11,131
- Get back.
- I'm in a hurry.

344
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:13,069
I said wait!

345
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:16,775
Get back or no one goes through.

346
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:19,505
- Let me through.
- Wait there.

347
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,082
- It's not fair.
- I said wait.

348
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,754
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir.

349
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:31,421
May I go through, sir?
- Go ahead.

350
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,096
Excuse me.

351
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:40,296
It's all right.

352
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:04,992
Hands up.

353
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,170
Go on, madam.

354
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,205
Go on.

355
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:36,451
I'll only be an hour.
He's a good boy.

356
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:41,053
Thank you.

357
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,363
Going to the beach, miss?

358
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:52,474
- How'd you know?
- Oh, I just guessed.

359
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,773
Care for some company?

360
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:57,309
Not today. I'm meeting friends.

361
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:58,879
What a shame!

362
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,515
Maybe another time?

363
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:02,844
Who knows?

364
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:07,547
Good luck.

365
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,817
Good luck.

366
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,284
A Coke, please.

367
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:56,196
Would you like to sit down?

368
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:04,000
One hundred francs.

369
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,065
Leaving, miss?

370
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:09,637
What a pity.

371
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,167
Attention, please.

372
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:25,042
Light 432 to Paris
will be delayed for 20 minutes.

373
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:40,294
Care for another martini?

374
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:44,716
What's going on?

375
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:54,701
A propane tank must've exploded.

376
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,474
The paratroopers are here!

377
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:21,345
JANUARY 10, 1957

378
00:54:29,157 --> 00:54:31,648
Jean Charrot, Inspector General

379
00:54:31,927 --> 00:54:33,986
on special assignment,

380
00:54:34,196 --> 00:54:37,131
presided over a special
meeting convened

381
00:54:37,332 --> 00:54:41,792
to organize the fight
against rebel activity.

382
00:54:43,004 --> 00:54:47,771
Major decisions were made concerning
the maintenance of law and order

383
00:54:48,009 --> 00:54:51,137
and the protection of persons
and private property.

384
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:56,441
General Carelle
of the 10th Airborne Division

385
00:54:56,718 --> 00:55:00,654
will be in charge
of maintaining order in Algiers.

386
00:55:00,822 --> 00:55:03,916
He will command
all civil and military forces

387
00:55:04,126 --> 00:55:07,527
and exercise special powers
by official decree.

388
00:55:18,907 --> 00:55:23,503
Mathieu, Philippe.
Born August 5, 1907, in Bordeaux.

389
00:55:23,745 --> 00:55:25,940
Rank lieutenant colonel.

390
00:55:26,181 --> 00:55:29,048
Campaigns Italy and Normandy.

391
00:55:29,317 --> 00:55:32,218
Member of an anti-Nazi
resistance movement.

392
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:37,721
Expeditions Madagascar and Suez.
Wars Indochina and Algeria.

393
00:55:38,026 --> 00:55:43,191
So we now average
4.2 attacks a day.

394
00:55:43,431 --> 00:55:47,663
We must distinguish between attacks
on individuals and bombings.

395
00:55:49,104 --> 00:55:51,299
As usual, the problem involves:

396
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:56,035
First, the adversary,
and second, the means to destroy him.

397
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:59,337
There are 400,000 Arabs
in Algiers.

398
00:55:59,581 --> 00:56:02,914
Are they all our enemies?
We know they're not.

399
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:08,688
But a small minority holds sway
by means of terror and violence.

400
00:56:09,691 --> 00:56:14,651
We must deal with this minority
in order to isolate and destroy it.

401
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:20,931
It's a dangerous enemy that
works in the open and underground,

402
00:56:21,136 --> 00:56:25,732
using tried-and-true revolutionary
methods as well as original tactics.

403
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:33,439
It's a faceless enemy, unrecognizable,

404
00:56:33,648 --> 00:56:36,242
blending in with hundreds of others.

405
00:56:36,484 --> 00:56:40,784
It is everywhere. In cafs,
in the alleys of the Casbah,

406
00:56:40,989 --> 00:56:43,924
or in the very streets
of the European quarter.

407
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:48,788
This footage was taken by the police

408
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:52,261
with cameras hidden
around Casbah checkpoints.

409
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:57,767
The police thought it might come in
handy, and indeed it does,

410
00:56:58,006 --> 00:57:01,169
to show the futility
of certain methods,

411
00:57:01,443 --> 00:57:03,877
or at least their drawbacks.

412
00:57:08,116 --> 00:57:12,314
I deliberately chose footage
taken shortly before

413
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,512
a number of recent
terrorist attacks.

414
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:20,050
Among all these Arab men
and women

415
00:57:20,262 --> 00:57:22,560
are the perpetrators.

416
00:57:22,831 --> 00:57:24,696
But who are they?

417
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,395
How can we recognize them?

418
00:57:30,171 --> 00:57:34,801
ID checks are ludicrous.
If anyone's papers are in order,

419
00:57:34,976 --> 00:57:36,568
it's the terrorist's.

420
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:43,616
Note the cameraman's hunch.
He's sure there's something in that box.

421
00:57:43,852 --> 00:57:47,083
And his film provides us
with the details.

422
00:57:49,524 --> 00:57:53,517
There might have been
a false bottom with a bomb inside.

423
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:55,491
We'll never know.

424
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:57,493
That's enough, Martin.

425
00:58:00,402 --> 00:58:02,768
We have to start from scratch.

426
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:07,435
The only information we have
concerns the organization's structure.

427
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,406
Let's start from there.

428
00:58:09,844 --> 00:58:11,641
It's a pyramid organization

429
00:58:11,913 --> 00:58:15,280
made up of a series of sections.
These sections, in turn,

430
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:18,314
are made up of triangles.

431
00:58:18,553 --> 00:58:20,748
At the apex
is the Executive Bureau.

432
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:24,925
The military head
of the Executive Bureau

433
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:29,426
finds a competent person
and names him section head: No. 1.

434
00:58:29,664 --> 00:58:34,363
No. 1 finds two others:
Nos. 2 and 3.

435
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,767
This makes up the first triangle.

436
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:41,408
Now Nos. 2 and 3
each select two men:

437
00:58:41,609 --> 00:58:43,474
Nos. 4,

438
00:58:43,611 --> 00:58:45,704
5, 6 and 7.

439
00:58:46,381 --> 00:58:50,841
The reason for these geometrics
is that each organization member

440
00:58:51,086 --> 00:58:53,577
knows only three other members:

441
00:58:53,788 --> 00:58:55,722
The one who chose him

442
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:58,255
and the two he himself chose.

443
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:00,894
Contact is made only in writing.

444
00:59:01,096 --> 00:59:04,429
That's why we don't know
our adversaries.

445
00:59:04,632 --> 00:59:09,433
Because, in point of fact,
they don't know each other.

446
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:13,133
To know them is to eliminate them.

447
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:18,142
Consequently, the purely military
aspect of the problem is secondary.

448
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:21,710
More important
is the policing aspect.

449
00:59:23,551 --> 00:59:25,781
I know you dislike that word.

450
00:59:27,455 --> 00:59:32,051
But it's the only one
that describes the work at hand.

451
00:59:32,293 --> 00:59:35,262
We must investigate
to reconstruct

452
00:59:35,463 --> 00:59:38,261
the pyramid and identify
the Executive Bureau.

453
00:59:38,466 --> 00:59:40,764
The basis of our job
is intelligence.

454
00:59:40,969 --> 00:59:44,302
The method: Interrogation.

455
00:59:45,106 --> 00:59:50,066
Conducted in such a way as
to ensure we always get an answer.

456
00:59:50,845 --> 00:59:55,908
In our situation, humane
considerations can only lead to despair

457
00:59:56,584 --> 00:59:57,778
and confusion.

458
00:59:59,254 --> 01:00:04,021
I'm sure all units will understand
and act accordingly.

459
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,592
Unfortunately, success doesn't
depend only on us.

460
01:00:09,431 --> 01:00:11,592
The city must be at our disposal.

461
01:00:11,866 --> 01:00:13,493
We must comb it thoroughly

462
01:00:13,768 --> 01:00:15,895
and question all inhabitants.

463
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:20,898
But that's where we run
into the maze of laws still in force,

464
01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:25,170
as if Algiers were a holiday resort
and not a battlefield.

465
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:29,748
We've requested a free hand,
but it's hard to obtain.

466
01:00:30,452 --> 01:00:33,888
So we need an occasion
that will justify our intervention

467
01:00:34,122 --> 01:00:36,056
and make it possible.

468
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:39,518
We ourselves must create
this occasion.

469
01:00:40,462 --> 01:00:45,798
Unless our adversary provides us
with one, as it seems to be doing now.

470
01:01:01,249 --> 01:01:03,217
To all militants

471
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:07,945
After two years of bitter struggle
in the cities and in the mountains,

472
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:11,386
the Algerian people
have won a great victory.

473
01:01:12,227 --> 01:01:14,127
On Monday, January 28,

474
01:01:14,362 --> 01:01:19,095
the United Nations will open debate
on the Algerian question.

475
01:01:20,168 --> 01:01:25,435
Our entire organization will mobilize
to explain this event's importance.

476
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:30,805
Beginning Monday, the LN is calling
a week-long general strike.

477
01:01:31,012 --> 01:01:35,210
During this period,
all armed action will be suspended.

478
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:42,252
Le Monde! Week-Iong strike!

479
01:01:52,734 --> 01:01:54,599
The money, please.

480
01:02:01,809 --> 01:02:03,003
We did it!

481
01:02:10,084 --> 01:02:11,745
People of Algeria,

482
01:02:12,453 --> 01:02:18,323
colonial powers, failing to block
UN debate on the Algerian question,

483
01:02:18,593 --> 01:02:23,690
will attempt to demonstrate that
the LN represents only a minority.

484
01:02:23,932 --> 01:02:26,423
World opinion is with us.

485
01:02:26,634 --> 01:02:28,864
Let us show our unity.

486
01:02:29,437 --> 01:02:32,736
Support the strike
proclaimed by the LN.

487
01:02:37,579 --> 01:02:41,640
During this entire week,
stay away from European quarters.

488
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:45,182
Do not leave the Casbah.
Avoid gathering in closed places,

489
01:02:45,486 --> 01:02:48,512
as this will facilitate raids.

490
01:02:49,791 --> 01:02:53,659
Give shelter to the poor
and homeless.

491
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:56,455
Stock up on food and water
for a week.

492
01:02:58,199 --> 01:03:02,192
- They seem calm.
- But you can feel something's up.

493
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,903
Like rabbits in a cage.
Just as I hoped.

494
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:12,213
Think they'll obey
the order to strike?

495
01:03:12,647 --> 01:03:13,807
I think so.

496
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:19,011
- Is it going the way you wanted?
- I hope so.

497
01:03:19,187 --> 01:03:21,678
What are you calling the operation?

498
01:03:22,056 --> 01:03:23,546
Well, General...

499
01:03:41,542 --> 01:03:44,636
DRINK CHAMPAGNE

500
01:03:50,184 --> 01:03:55,247
- "Operation Champagne."
- Why not?

501
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:58,754
Operation Champagne it is.

502
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:12,503
The homeless, the unemployed,
the beggars.

503
01:04:12,774 --> 01:04:17,802
We've arranged for them to stay
with families during the strike.

504
01:04:18,012 --> 01:04:21,140
That way they'll be
safe from police raids.

505
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:24,512
But I don't think they should
have been brought here.

506
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:26,880
It's a mistake.
- Why?

507
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:31,455
You're here. We'd better
move you somewhere else.

508
01:04:31,693 --> 01:04:35,527
- Don't you trust them?
- I do, but you never know.

509
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:39,327
All right. You're in charge.

510
01:04:39,567 --> 01:04:44,436
If I were in charge,
you wouldn't be in Algiers now.

511
01:04:46,941 --> 01:04:50,308
- Duty first?
- Caution is best.

512
01:04:55,717 --> 01:04:59,585
Ali, take Ben M'Hidi
to the Maison des Arbres.

513
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,819
Isn't he staying here?

514
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:06,482
No. Go with him.
I'll wait for you to come back.

515
01:05:08,663 --> 01:05:10,153
What do you think?

516
01:05:11,165 --> 01:05:15,465
How's this for a hideout?
Looks like a wall.

517
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:17,736
Take a look inside.

518
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:20,136
Not now. It's late.

519
01:05:25,446 --> 01:05:28,074
Si Ben M'Hidi,
I'll be in touch tomorrow.

520
01:05:28,816 --> 01:05:30,408
Ali, go first.

521
01:05:38,259 --> 01:05:40,887
Cut through the mosque.

522
01:05:55,042 --> 01:05:57,909
The coast is clear.

523
01:06:04,552 --> 01:06:07,350
We can't do anything for a week.

524
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,489
What do you think of the strike?

525
01:06:10,691 --> 01:06:12,090
I think it'll succeed.

526
01:06:12,293 --> 01:06:16,457
I think so, too.
It's been well organized.

527
01:06:17,498 --> 01:06:19,193
What will the French do?

528
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:23,336
Obviously, they'll try everything
to break it.

529
01:06:24,071 --> 01:06:26,869
They'll do more than that,

530
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:29,872
because we've given them
an opportunity.

531
01:06:30,745 --> 01:06:32,872
You know what I mean?

532
01:06:34,081 --> 01:06:37,812
Now they'll no longer
be groping in the dark.

533
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,888
Every striker

534
01:06:41,055 --> 01:06:43,580
will be a recognizable enemy.

535
01:06:43,858 --> 01:06:49,057
A certified criminal.
The French will take the offensive.

536
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:52,460
Understand what I mean?
- Yes.

537
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:57,237
Jaffar says you weren't
in favor of the strike.

538
01:06:57,572 --> 01:07:00,939
- No, I wasn't.
- Why not?

539
01:07:01,242 --> 01:07:04,609
Because we were ordered
not to use arms.

540
01:07:05,046 --> 01:07:08,447
Acts of violence don't win wars.

541
01:07:08,683 --> 01:07:11,345
Neither wars nor revolutions.

542
01:07:11,853 --> 01:07:14,117
Terrorism is useful as a start.

543
01:07:14,322 --> 01:07:17,758
But then, the people
themselves must act.

544
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:21,359
That's the rationale
behind this strike.

545
01:07:21,596 --> 01:07:25,532
To mobilize all Algerians,

546
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,995
to assess our strength.

547
01:07:28,903 --> 01:07:30,530
To prove it to the UN?

548
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:34,031
Yes, to prove it to the UN.

549
01:07:34,609 --> 01:07:36,907
It may not do any good,

550
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:42,673
but at least the UN will be able
to gauge our strength.

551
01:07:42,917 --> 01:07:44,680
You know, Ali,

552
01:07:44,952 --> 01:07:47,853
it's hard enough to start
a revolution,

553
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:52,985
even harder to sustain it,

554
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:56,061
and hardest of all to win it.

555
01:07:56,297 --> 01:08:00,859
But it's only afterwards,
once we've won,

556
01:08:01,068 --> 01:08:03,730
that the real difficulties begin.

557
01:08:05,172 --> 01:08:08,938
In short, there's still much to do.

558
01:08:09,844 --> 01:08:11,812
You're not tired, Ali?

559
01:08:12,246 --> 01:08:13,304
No.

560
01:09:10,871 --> 01:09:12,065
Wake up!

561
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:14,731
Everybody out!

562
01:09:22,316 --> 01:09:25,513
You bastards!
We'll teach you to strike!

563
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:18,737
Attention all vehicles!

564
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:23,670
Load the requisitioned workers!
Truck No. 1 to El Biar.

565
01:10:23,911 --> 01:10:25,708
No. 2, the gasworks.

566
01:10:25,913 --> 01:10:27,710
No. 3, the docks.

567
01:10:27,915 --> 01:10:30,213
Attention!

568
01:10:31,585 --> 01:10:34,748
Dispatch all suspects
to headquarters.

569
01:10:41,562 --> 01:10:42,551
That one.

570
01:10:42,797 --> 01:10:45,857
You, come here. Stop.

571
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,198
On strike, are you?
- I'm sick.

572
01:10:49,403 --> 01:10:53,601
You're too scared to admit it.
Admit you're with the FLN.

573
01:10:54,075 --> 01:10:56,373
You're one of them.

574
01:10:56,577 --> 01:10:59,569
Take me for an idiot?
Think I can't tell?

575
01:10:59,814 --> 01:11:04,444
The FLN wants you to strike
and you won't talk? You dirty Arab!

576
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,416
Suit yourself.
Grard, take him away.

577
01:11:08,689 --> 01:11:11,180
- Come with me.
- Are you deaf?

578
01:11:15,262 --> 01:11:17,025
Everyone back to work!

579
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:19,791
Get a move on!

580
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:27,969
Day four:
The general strike continues.

581
01:11:28,175 --> 01:11:32,874
All activity has come to a halt.
No serious incident has been reported.

582
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,981
All is quiet in the Muslim quarter.

583
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:39,476
I'll call you back.

584
01:11:41,789 --> 01:11:43,086
Mathieu's here.

585
01:11:48,796 --> 01:11:51,390
- Some questions...
- I'm meeting with the prefect.

586
01:11:51,665 --> 01:11:56,034
- What's going on?
- I'm just assessing the situation.

587
01:11:56,270 --> 01:12:01,367
Go and see for yourselves.
You're free to move around.

588
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:05,636
- The strike seems successful.
- It missed its main target.

589
01:12:05,813 --> 01:12:07,440
Insurrection?

590
01:12:07,681 --> 01:12:10,878
That isn't the aim.
- You believe the FLN?

591
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:14,747
It's plausible this time.
A strike might convince the UN.

592
01:12:15,022 --> 01:12:18,981
The UN is far away.
How can it gauge a strike's magnitude?

593
01:12:19,093 --> 01:12:22,119
Bombs would be more practical.
That would be my choice.

594
01:12:24,198 --> 01:12:26,758
What would
armed insurrection mean now?

595
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:31,267
What it always means: An inevitable
phase in revolutionary warfare.

596
01:12:31,539 --> 01:12:34,372
After terrorism
comes armed insurrection.

597
01:12:34,575 --> 01:12:38,170
Just as guerrilla warfare leads
to warfare proper.

598
01:12:38,412 --> 01:12:39,504
Dien Bien Phu?

599
01:12:39,747 --> 01:12:43,205
Exactly.
But in Indochina they won.

600
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:45,645
- And here?
- That depends on you.

601
01:12:46,287 --> 01:12:49,518
On us?
You intend to sign us up?

602
01:12:49,757 --> 01:12:53,591
God forbid! Just do your reporting
and do it well.

603
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:56,422
It's not warriors we need.
- Then what?

604
01:12:56,664 --> 01:12:59,997
Political will, which is sometimes
there and sometimes isn't.

605
01:13:00,267 --> 01:13:03,964
Sometimes it's not enough.
What did Paris say yesterday?

606
01:13:04,238 --> 01:13:06,900
Nothing. Another article by Sartre.

607
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:12,970
Why are the Sartres
always born on the other side?

608
01:13:13,247 --> 01:13:15,010
Then you like Sartre?

609
01:13:15,249 --> 01:13:19,015
No, but I like him
even less as a foe.

610
01:13:23,557 --> 01:13:26,617
1, 2, 3, 4...
Come with me.

611
01:13:28,729 --> 01:13:30,697
Move it.

612
01:13:44,912 --> 01:13:47,574
- What's that?
- The dance hall.

613
01:13:57,358 --> 01:14:01,658
Let's get it over with.
Repeat what you said and you can go.

614
01:14:01,929 --> 01:14:03,419
Name?
- Smain.

615
01:14:03,631 --> 01:14:05,258
- First name?
- Ahmed.

616
01:14:05,499 --> 01:14:07,660
- Section?
- Second section.

617
01:14:07,935 --> 01:14:11,200
- Be more precise.
- Second section.

618
01:14:11,372 --> 01:14:12,862
Casbah, Algiers West.

619
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,871
- Which group?
- Third group.

620
01:14:15,042 --> 01:14:19,843
- What was your role?
- Head of the sixth cell.

621
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,206
That'll do.

622
01:15:27,915 --> 01:15:29,610
DAY SIX OF THE STRIKE

623
01:15:29,883 --> 01:15:31,248
People of the Casbah,

624
01:15:31,618 --> 01:15:35,145
the LN wants to stop you
from working.

625
01:15:35,389 --> 01:15:39,189
The LN is forcing you
to close your shops.

626
01:15:39,426 --> 01:15:44,363
The LN wants to starve you
and condemn you to poverty.

627
01:15:44,565 --> 01:15:47,295
The FLN wants to stop you
from working.

628
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:49,533
People of the Casbah,

629
01:15:49,903 --> 01:15:53,395
France is your motherland.

630
01:15:54,775 --> 01:16:00,042
Mohammed! Mohammed!
Have you seen him?

631
01:16:01,615 --> 01:16:07,019
The LN wants to starve you
and condemn you to poverty.

632
01:16:07,621 --> 01:16:12,991
People of the Casbah,
resist the LN's orders.

633
01:16:13,627 --> 01:16:16,061
Thank God you're home.

634
01:16:17,398 --> 01:16:20,333
God bless you, my children.

635
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:23,025
Have you seen my brother Said?

636
01:17:00,674 --> 01:17:03,108
Algerians! Brothers! Take heart!

637
01:17:03,477 --> 01:17:06,742
The LN tells you not to be afraid!

638
01:17:08,215 --> 01:17:11,673
Don't worry, we're winning.

639
01:17:13,454 --> 01:17:15,718
The LN is on your side.

640
01:17:16,623 --> 01:17:19,683
Long live Algeria!

641
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:42,514
FEBRUARY 5, 1957

642
01:17:42,716 --> 01:17:44,616
FINAL DAY OF THE STRIKE

643
01:18:04,505 --> 01:18:06,302
Open the shop.

644
01:18:21,188 --> 01:18:22,348
Go on!

645
01:18:22,956 --> 01:18:24,116
Faster!

646
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:44,833
The UN General Assembly,

647
01:18:45,045 --> 01:18:50,984
all motions having failed
to obtain a majority,

648
01:18:51,218 --> 01:18:56,485
has passed a resolution ruling out
any direct intervention in Algeria.

649
01:18:57,724 --> 01:19:01,683
The UN, however, hopes that
in a spirit of cooperation,

650
01:19:01,929 --> 01:19:05,831
a peaceful, democratic
and fair solution will be found

651
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:09,366
in keeping with the principles
of the UN charter.

652
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,153
Good. Well done.

653
01:20:03,023 --> 01:20:04,888
Now we can go turn in.

654
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:10,289
The end of the strike changes nothing.
Instructions remain the same.

655
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:12,760
Give your boys the usual orders.

656
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,834
We must occupy the Casbah
24 hours a day.

657
01:20:17,404 --> 01:20:21,340
We must continue our work here,
without respite.

658
01:20:30,117 --> 01:20:32,847
Any of you ever suffer from tapeworm?

659
01:20:33,587 --> 01:20:35,919
It's a worm that can grow infinitely.

660
01:20:36,156 --> 01:20:39,592
You can destroy
its thousands of segments

661
01:20:39,826 --> 01:20:44,422
but as long as the head remains,
it rebuilds and proliferates.

662
01:20:44,698 --> 01:20:46,893
The FLN is similarly organized.

663
01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:50,399
The head is the Executive Bureau.
Several persons.

664
01:20:50,604 --> 01:20:54,734
As long as they're not eliminated,
we're back to zero.

665
01:20:54,941 --> 01:20:56,704
Here are four of them.

666
01:21:02,282 --> 01:21:04,876
I found these in the police records.

667
01:21:05,185 --> 01:21:06,675
I had the snapshots blown up.

668
01:21:08,188 --> 01:21:09,746
Si Murad.

669
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:11,450
Ramel.

670
01:21:12,526 --> 01:21:13,720
Jaffar.

671
01:21:18,598 --> 01:21:19,826
Ali La Pointe.

672
01:21:19,933 --> 01:21:24,370
Print up a thousand copies
and distribute them to our men.

673
01:21:25,072 --> 01:21:26,937
Who else lives here?

674
01:21:27,174 --> 01:21:32,339
I told you. My daughter upstairs,
and my husband, who's at work.

675
01:21:32,612 --> 01:21:35,604
Okay, Pierre. Let's go.

676
01:21:40,087 --> 01:21:41,714
They're gone.

677
01:22:09,449 --> 01:22:11,280
There were ten this time.

678
01:22:11,451 --> 01:22:12,884
- Paratroopers?
- Yes.

679
01:22:13,086 --> 01:22:15,680
Did a traitor bring them here?

680
01:22:15,956 --> 01:22:17,218
They came alone.

681
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:20,485
They asked questions.
They didn't hurt anyone.

682
01:22:22,796 --> 01:22:26,095
Jibela Malika has been arrested.

683
01:22:26,967 --> 01:22:29,959
Sheik Abdullah has been arrested...

684
01:22:51,625 --> 01:22:56,824
People of the Casbah,
the LN has lost the battle.

685
01:22:58,398 --> 01:23:02,334
Stand up to its dying authority.

686
01:23:02,636 --> 01:23:06,732
Work with us to build
a new Algeria.

687
01:23:08,041 --> 01:23:11,204
Mujid Ben Ali has been arrested.

688
01:23:26,326 --> 01:23:28,886
- What's wrong?
- They arrested him.

689
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:30,619
Take courage.

690
01:23:43,543 --> 01:23:48,378
We'll split up.
We must change our hideouts.

691
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:52,679
We must reestablish our contacts.

692
01:23:53,286 --> 01:23:56,084
We must replace
those arrested and killed

693
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:58,151
and reorganize our groups.

694
01:23:58,992 --> 01:24:01,085
We have to make our presence felt.

695
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:02,955
That'll come later.

696
01:24:03,196 --> 01:24:06,529
No. Right now.
Leave it to me.

697
01:24:07,434 --> 01:24:10,335
No. None of us will do anything.

698
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:14,097
We have to resist
as much as we can,

699
01:24:14,374 --> 01:24:18,003
without giving the enemy
a chance to catch us. Agreed?

700
01:24:18,979 --> 01:24:21,038
We have to do something.

701
01:24:21,281 --> 01:24:24,250
That's why we must reestablish
our contacts first.

702
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:28,518
- How do we move?
- I'll take care of that.

703
01:24:50,577 --> 01:24:52,636
I'll be out in three months.

704
01:24:52,846 --> 01:24:54,245
Hey, look!

705
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:03,843
Quick, hide us!
We're being followed.

706
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:07,048
Where? On the terrace?

707
01:26:07,454 --> 01:26:11,220
Come in, brothers.
God protect you.

708
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:16,122
Hide in the well.
God be with you.

709
01:26:50,397 --> 01:26:55,391
They're gone. Wait until I call.
Then you can come up.

710
01:26:56,236 --> 01:26:57,533
Thank you.

711
01:27:01,274 --> 01:27:04,710
The first section's dead.
There's no one left.

712
01:27:05,578 --> 01:27:08,240
We lost contact with the second.

713
01:27:08,481 --> 01:27:10,415
The third is reorganizing.

714
01:27:10,617 --> 01:27:14,519
All that's left is the fourth.
It's enough to start over with.

715
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:17,546
FEBRUARY 25, 1957

716
01:27:51,057 --> 01:27:54,754
Bastard!
You'll pay for the others!

717
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:05,693
Keep calm! Get back!

718
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:39,703
MARCH 4, 1957

719
01:28:44,077 --> 01:28:45,977
No more photographs.

720
01:28:47,147 --> 01:28:48,546
Mr. Ben M'Hidi,

721
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:51,948
isn't it cowardly to use
your women's baskets

722
01:28:52,152 --> 01:28:56,088
to carry bombs, which have
taken so many innocent lives?

723
01:28:57,857 --> 01:29:02,226
Isn't it even more cowardly
to attack defenseless villages

724
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:05,659
with napalm bombs that kill
many thousands of times more?

725
01:29:05,932 --> 01:29:09,424
Obviously, planes would
make things easier for us.

726
01:29:09,669 --> 01:29:11,432
Give us your bombers, sir,

727
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:13,902
and you can have our baskets.

728
01:29:33,159 --> 01:29:36,788
The FLN has more of a chance
of defeating the French army

729
01:29:37,030 --> 01:29:39,362
than the French have
of changing the course of history.

730
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:43,333
According to a declaration
by Colonel Mathieu,

731
01:29:43,536 --> 01:29:47,097
you were arrested by chance.
Practically by mistake.

732
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:49,865
The paratroopers

733
01:29:50,109 --> 01:29:54,808
were looking for someone
less important than you.

734
01:29:55,048 --> 01:29:58,142
Can you tell us why you were
in that apartment

735
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:00,546
on rue Debussy?

736
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:03,853
All I can say is
I wish I'd never set foot there.

737
01:30:05,758 --> 01:30:08,784
That'll be all.
It's late and we have work to do.

738
01:30:09,429 --> 01:30:10,453
So the show's over?

739
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:12,596
Yes, it's over.

740
01:30:13,233 --> 01:30:15,827
Before it has
the opposite effect.

741
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:35,749
People of the Casbah,
the rebellion is dying out.

742
01:30:37,557 --> 01:30:42,256
Ali Mohammed, head of
LN Section 2, was killed this morning.

743
01:30:44,998 --> 01:30:46,932
People of Algiers,

744
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:49,866
turn in the agitators.

745
01:30:50,603 --> 01:30:53,436
Disassociate yourselves
from the rebel organization.

746
01:30:55,642 --> 01:31:00,443
The army is protecting you.
Trust in it.

747
01:31:15,295 --> 01:31:16,728
Colonel Mathieu,

748
01:31:16,996 --> 01:31:20,932
the spokesman for
the Resident Minister, Mr. Gorlin,

749
01:31:21,134 --> 01:31:23,364
states that Larbi Ben M'Hidi

750
01:31:23,569 --> 01:31:25,537
hanged himself in his cell

751
01:31:26,272 --> 01:31:31,938
using strips of his shirt
that he made into a rope

752
01:31:32,178 --> 01:31:35,579
and tied to the bars of his window.

753
01:31:37,150 --> 01:31:41,985
Given his stated intention
to escape at the first opportunity,

754
01:31:42,221 --> 01:31:43,745
it was thought necessary

755
01:31:44,023 --> 01:31:47,083
to keep the prisoner bound

756
01:31:47,226 --> 01:31:51,026
hand and foot at all times.
In your opinion, Colonel,

757
01:31:51,264 --> 01:31:54,062
in such a condition, can a man

758
01:31:54,267 --> 01:31:59,500
tear his shirt up,
make a rope out of it,

759
01:31:59,739 --> 01:32:02,264
and hang himself from a window?

760
01:32:03,476 --> 01:32:05,637
Ask the spokesman about that.

761
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:07,774
I didn't make such a statement.

762
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:14,951
For my part, I had the chance
to appreciate the moral fiber,

763
01:32:15,221 --> 01:32:19,885
courage and commitment
of Ben M'Hidi to his own ideals.

764
01:32:20,126 --> 01:32:24,187
And so, notwithstanding
the great danger he represented,

765
01:32:24,430 --> 01:32:26,398
I pay tribute to his memory.

766
01:32:29,235 --> 01:32:33,228
There's been a lot of talk, not only
of the paratroopers' success,

767
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:38,237
but also of the methods
they're said to use.

768
01:32:38,444 --> 01:32:40,139
Can you comment on this?

769
01:32:40,847 --> 01:32:44,214
Their success is the result
of these methods.

770
01:32:44,417 --> 01:32:46,248
One depends on the other.

771
01:32:46,452 --> 01:32:48,386
Excuse me, Colonel.

772
01:32:48,621 --> 01:32:53,081
It seems to be that, perhaps
out of an excess of caution,

773
01:32:53,292 --> 01:32:57,524
my colleagues keep asking you
indirect questions

774
01:32:57,730 --> 01:33:01,496
to which you can only reply
in a roundabout way.

775
01:33:01,734 --> 01:33:04,601
It would be better to call...

776
01:33:05,571 --> 01:33:09,507
a spade a spade.
So let's talk about torture.

777
01:33:09,742 --> 01:33:13,200
I understand.
And you? Have you no question?

778
01:33:13,446 --> 01:33:17,974
They've all been asked.
I'd just like more precise answers.

779
01:33:18,985 --> 01:33:24,184
Let's try to be precise.
The word "torture" isn't used in our orders.

780
01:33:24,424 --> 01:33:28,019
We use interrogation
as the only valid police method

781
01:33:28,227 --> 01:33:30,821
against clandestine activity.

782
01:33:31,631 --> 01:33:34,532
The FLN asks all its members,

783
01:33:34,767 --> 01:33:39,067
in case of capture,
to remain silent for 24 hours.

784
01:33:39,372 --> 01:33:41,465
Then they may talk.

785
01:33:41,774 --> 01:33:47,178
This gives the FLN time
to render any information useless.

786
01:33:47,413 --> 01:33:51,474
And us? What form of questioning
must we adopt?

787
01:33:51,684 --> 01:33:53,743
Civil law procedures,

788
01:33:53,986 --> 01:33:56,079
which take months
for a mere misdemeanor?

789
01:33:56,322 --> 01:33:58,290
Legality can be inconvenient.

790
01:33:58,458 --> 01:34:02,394
Is it legal to set off bombs
in public places?

791
01:34:02,862 --> 01:34:07,162
Remember Ben M'Hidi's answer
when you asked him the question.

792
01:34:08,401 --> 01:34:12,565
No, gentlemen, believe me.
It's a vicious circle.

793
01:34:13,873 --> 01:34:18,310
We could talk for hours to no avail,
because that isn't the problem.

794
01:34:19,112 --> 01:34:20,636
The problem is this:

795
01:34:21,047 --> 01:34:24,642
The FLN wants to throw us out
of Algeria, and we want to stay.

796
01:34:24,817 --> 01:34:27,786
Even with slight shades of opinion,

797
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:30,818
you all agree that we must stay.

798
01:34:31,023 --> 01:34:34,925
When the FLN rebellion began,
there were no shades at all.

799
01:34:35,161 --> 01:34:39,495
Every paper, the communist press
included, wanted it crushed.

800
01:34:39,732 --> 01:34:42,223
We're here for that reason alone.

801
01:34:42,435 --> 01:34:45,598
We're neither madmen nor sadists.

802
01:34:45,838 --> 01:34:48,398
Those who call us fascists

803
01:34:48,674 --> 01:34:52,804
forget the role many of us
played in the Resistance.

804
01:34:53,045 --> 01:34:54,535
Those who call us Nazis

805
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:58,272
don't know that some of us survived
Dachau and Buchenwald.

806
01:34:58,518 --> 01:35:02,386
We are soldiers.
Our duty is to win.

807
01:35:02,655 --> 01:35:04,680
Therefore, to be precise,

808
01:35:05,525 --> 01:35:08,289
it's my turn to ask a question.

809
01:35:08,528 --> 01:35:11,497
Should France stay in Algeria?

810
01:35:12,131 --> 01:35:14,326
If your answer is still yes,

811
01:35:14,567 --> 01:35:17,559
then you must accept
all the consequences.

812
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:10,974
A doctor!
He's been stabbed!

813
01:37:28,601 --> 01:37:30,796
I'm out of ammo!

814
01:37:39,445 --> 01:37:41,208
Look there!

815
01:37:42,114 --> 01:37:43,103
Run them down!

816
01:37:56,062 --> 01:37:58,860
AUGUST 26, 1957

817
01:38:17,516 --> 01:38:19,040
Make way for the colonel.

818
01:38:20,753 --> 01:38:25,122
There's no point playing the hero.
Hand me the megaphone.

819
01:38:30,363 --> 01:38:33,389
Ramel. Si Murad.

820
01:38:34,066 --> 01:38:35,260
Listen:

821
01:38:36,268 --> 01:38:40,136
I wouldn't want to be
in your shoes when you're captured.

822
01:38:40,373 --> 01:38:42,238
You know we'll get you.

823
01:38:44,543 --> 01:38:51,142
Surrender and you won't be harmed.
You'll get a fair trial.

824
01:38:52,284 --> 01:38:54,218
Do you hear?
- Who's speaking?

825
01:38:55,087 --> 01:38:57,385
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.

826
01:38:58,591 --> 01:39:00,752
We don't trust you.

827
01:39:02,061 --> 01:39:03,858
Come closer.

828
01:39:05,831 --> 01:39:07,196
Let us see you.

829
01:39:07,733 --> 01:39:10,167
Why don't you trust me?

830
01:39:10,803 --> 01:39:13,704
Stand up so that we can see you.

831
01:39:13,939 --> 01:39:16,772
Keep your hands still
and in sight.

832
01:39:18,477 --> 01:39:23,380
But we want the promise
of a fair trial in writing.

833
01:39:27,953 --> 01:39:32,049
Give us a written promise.
Then we'll surrender.

834
01:39:32,925 --> 01:39:35,553
How do I get it to you?

835
01:39:36,028 --> 01:39:39,486
We'll lower our guns in a basket.

836
01:39:39,732 --> 01:39:41,859
Fair enough.
I'm make this statement in writing.

837
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,290
Finished?

838
01:40:13,265 --> 01:40:14,630
Yes, finished.

839
01:40:21,207 --> 01:40:25,576
- Ready, Mathieu?
- Yes, but let's see you first.

840
01:40:36,922 --> 01:40:41,188
28, 27, 26,

841
01:40:41,694 --> 01:40:45,926
25, 24, 23...

842
01:40:53,439 --> 01:40:56,272
We can see them now.
Go ahead.

843
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:04,376
Here.

844
01:41:04,583 --> 01:41:09,020
You know that when I give my word,
I keep it.

845
01:41:12,057 --> 01:41:14,582
The bastard! He got away!

846
01:41:25,604 --> 01:41:28,437
Faster, dirty Arab!

847
01:41:28,541 --> 01:41:30,805
Take this, you dog!

848
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:39,211
Burn all the papers.

849
01:41:39,485 --> 01:41:41,350
SEPTEMBER 24, 1957

850
01:41:45,057 --> 01:41:46,319
Don't leave a trace.

851
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,664
Which of you is Zakia?

852
01:41:57,536 --> 01:41:58,969
You?

853
01:41:59,204 --> 01:42:02,696
Go tell Jaffar to surrender

854
01:42:02,808 --> 01:42:05,242
or we'll blow up the house
and everyone in it.

855
01:42:05,578 --> 01:42:08,843
Try to convince him
if you want to keep your house.

856
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:10,571
Got that?

857
01:42:12,017 --> 01:42:14,713
Wait. You'll get yourself killed.

858
01:42:14,987 --> 01:42:15,954
Jaffar!

859
01:42:17,323 --> 01:42:21,191
Zakia's coming up.
I wouldn't shoot if I were you.

860
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:23,155
Go on now.

861
01:42:39,478 --> 01:42:40,911
Jaffar.

862
01:42:41,413 --> 01:42:42,846
Listen to me.

863
01:42:43,048 --> 01:42:45,414
They say if you don't come down,

864
01:42:45,651 --> 01:42:47,278
they'll blow up the house.

865
01:42:47,519 --> 01:42:51,285
You can tell them to blow up
whatever they want.

866
01:42:52,157 --> 01:42:53,715
Go tell them!

867
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:04,000
He says he won't surrender,
that you can blow it all up.

868
01:43:04,236 --> 01:43:06,067
All right. Join the others.

869
01:43:08,407 --> 01:43:09,897
Prepare the explosives.

870
01:43:10,109 --> 01:43:12,942
Get as close as possible,
but don't take risks.

871
01:43:13,045 --> 01:43:14,774
Use a long fuse, then cut it.

872
01:43:15,014 --> 01:43:18,415
Give them cover while they work.

873
01:43:23,322 --> 01:43:28,191
You, keep your eyes open.
Anything can happen, as we know.

874
01:44:01,727 --> 01:44:06,164
It's really pointless
to die like this.

875
01:44:08,867 --> 01:44:14,237
Mathieu! If you give me your word
not to hurt anyone in this house,

876
01:44:14,473 --> 01:44:16,236
we'll come down.

877
01:44:24,983 --> 01:44:28,146
I'd have hated to blow you all up.

878
01:44:28,387 --> 01:44:29,547
Why?

879
01:44:30,556 --> 01:44:33,286
Your picture and your file

880
01:44:33,525 --> 01:44:36,153
have been on my desk for months.

881
01:44:36,495 --> 01:44:39,362
I have the feeling I know you a bit.

882
01:44:40,733 --> 01:44:44,032
You don't strike me as the kind
for empty gestures.

883
01:44:44,937 --> 01:44:47,838
You seem satisfied
to have me alive.

884
01:44:49,441 --> 01:44:50,373
Yes, I am.

885
01:44:51,510 --> 01:44:55,571
I thought you'd regret it.
I gave you an unexpected advantage.

886
01:44:56,448 --> 01:44:59,849
No, only the satisfaction
of having had the right hunch.

887
01:45:01,553 --> 01:45:02,577
Technically speaking,

888
01:45:02,888 --> 01:45:06,483
we can't talk about advantages.
The game's over.

889
01:45:07,159 --> 01:45:11,323
Monster! Hypocrite! You're wrong.
Ali La Pointe is still in the Casbah.

890
01:45:11,530 --> 01:45:12,622
What's she saying?

891
01:45:13,832 --> 01:45:16,392
She says Ali La Pointe is still free.

892
01:45:40,726 --> 01:45:42,353
- Come in.
- I'm coming.

893
01:45:43,295 --> 01:45:46,093
You're tired. Go rest.

894
01:45:51,637 --> 01:45:53,127
Omar, go to bed.

895
01:45:53,305 --> 01:45:55,296
We have a job tomorrow.

896
01:45:55,507 --> 01:45:59,773
Myself, Mahmud, Hassiba...

897
01:46:03,949 --> 01:46:05,382
and you.

898
01:46:06,952 --> 01:46:12,049
There's no one else left.
Sadek will drive.

899
01:46:12,291 --> 01:46:16,728
You get out, plant the bomb,
and come back fast.

900
01:46:17,396 --> 01:46:21,230
Be sure they don't follow you.
Then we'll get out.

901
01:46:21,433 --> 01:46:25,392
Hassiba first, then Mahmud.
I'll see to the rest.

902
01:47:11,516 --> 01:47:12,847
Wake up.

903
01:47:17,723 --> 01:47:20,920
Sleep well?
Get ready to go.

904
01:47:26,565 --> 01:47:29,830
- Is it time?
- Almost.

905
01:47:30,369 --> 01:47:31,996
Hassiba!
- I'm ready.

906
01:47:32,237 --> 01:47:34,398
I heard a truck.

907
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:38,508
So did I. But if it was Sadek,
he'd be here by now.

908
01:47:44,583 --> 01:47:47,814
- How's your wife?
- She's fine.

909
01:47:49,521 --> 01:47:51,148
Inside!

910
01:48:47,045 --> 01:48:48,239
Outside!

911
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:50,108
On your feet!

912
01:49:43,802 --> 01:49:44,427
Well?

913
01:49:44,669 --> 01:49:47,001
All ready.
I had the house evacuated.

914
01:49:47,205 --> 01:49:49,969
- Has he answered?
- Absolute silence.

915
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:51,971
I thought as much.

916
01:49:55,881 --> 01:49:57,109
Ali La Pointe!

917
01:49:58,316 --> 01:50:02,252
At least let the others out,
or you'll all be blown up.

918
01:50:03,088 --> 01:50:05,716
The boy will just go
to the reformatory for a while.

919
01:50:06,658 --> 01:50:08,489
Why let him die?

920
01:50:21,406 --> 01:50:23,636
He's still here?
Take him away.

921
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:37,185
Ali... Ali La Pointe!

922
01:50:37,389 --> 01:50:40,825
You have another 30 seconds.
What are you hoping for?

923
01:50:41,093 --> 01:50:43,493
Anyway, you've lost.

924
01:50:44,696 --> 01:50:46,857
Think hard. Thirty seconds.

925
01:50:47,065 --> 01:50:49,158
Thirty seconds from now.

926
01:50:53,538 --> 01:50:55,563
Whoever wants to can go.

927
01:50:56,541 --> 01:51:00,307
- What'll you do?
- I don't trust them.

928
01:51:06,384 --> 01:51:09,512
You four stay here.
Come down when I give the signal.

929
01:52:01,306 --> 01:52:03,399
- Everything ready?
- All ready, sir.

930
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:30,800
Stand back.

931
01:53:05,804 --> 01:53:08,830
You two cover him and be careful.
You never know.

932
01:53:16,915 --> 01:53:19,110
The tapeworm's headless now.

933
01:53:19,351 --> 01:53:21,615
Satisfied, Mathieu?
- Yes, sir.

934
01:53:21,853 --> 01:53:25,380
- The FLN is decapitated in Algiers.
- We'll hear no more of it.

935
01:53:26,658 --> 01:53:30,321
At least for the time being.
- Forever, let's hope.

936
01:53:30,528 --> 01:53:34,464
They're basically decent people.
We got on fine for 130 years.

937
01:53:34,666 --> 01:53:39,160
Why shouldn't it continue?
- But Algiers isn't all of Algeria.

938
01:53:39,404 --> 01:53:42,134
No, Algiers isn't all Algeria.

939
01:53:42,374 --> 01:53:46,902
True, but for now
let's settle for Algiers.

940
01:53:47,145 --> 01:53:49,909
Things are much easier
in the mountains.

941
01:53:57,188 --> 01:53:58,519
Good-bye, sir.

942
01:53:58,790 --> 01:54:02,817
Good-bye, Mathieu.
I'll see you this afternoon.

943
01:54:03,094 --> 01:54:04,493
Yes, sir.

944
01:54:09,100 --> 01:54:12,627
DECEMBER 11, 1960

945
01:54:22,380 --> 01:54:27,443
or some unknown reason,
due to some obscure motive,

946
01:54:27,986 --> 01:54:30,887
after two years of relative quiet,

947
01:54:31,156 --> 01:54:33,420
with the war contained mostly

948
01:54:33,591 --> 01:54:37,960
in the mountains, disturbances
broke out again without warning,

949
01:54:38,196 --> 01:54:41,563
and nobody knows why or how.

950
01:54:41,833 --> 01:54:44,700
I phoned Tunis.

951
01:54:44,936 --> 01:54:49,999
I spoke to an exiled LN chief,
but he knows nothing either.

952
01:54:52,010 --> 01:54:55,377
Long live Algeria!

953
01:55:05,890 --> 01:55:10,793
This morning, for the first time,
out came flags with crescent and star.

954
01:55:11,596 --> 01:55:13,086
Thousands of flags,

955
01:55:13,198 --> 01:55:15,223
probably made overnight.

956
01:55:16,301 --> 01:55:20,635
"Lags"is hardly the word.
More like torn sheets, shirts, rags -

957
01:55:20,905 --> 01:55:22,736
but flags nevertheless.

958
01:55:32,684 --> 01:55:34,914
We're marching for freedom!

959
01:56:03,014 --> 01:56:04,709
The situation is more tense today.

960
01:56:05,784 --> 01:56:06,910
Despite pressure

961
01:56:07,218 --> 01:56:11,621
from the most rigid colonialists,
the government had given orders

962
01:56:11,790 --> 01:56:14,281
not to open fire
except as a last resort.

963
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:20,827
Attempts were made this afternoon
to descend into the European quarter.

964
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:26,302
There were several casualties,
but things seem to have calmed down.

965
01:56:27,238 --> 01:56:29,103
The Muslim quarters still echo

966
01:56:29,307 --> 01:56:32,538
with those unintelligible
and frightening rhythmic cries.

967
01:58:21,452 --> 01:58:24,910
The surprising unity
of these demonstrations

968
01:58:25,290 --> 01:58:28,817
has made a deep impression
on rench public opinion.

969
01:58:29,093 --> 01:58:33,257
According to Paris, a significant
segment of the political class

970
01:58:33,531 --> 01:58:37,399
is in favor of seeking
a new relationship with Algeria.

971
01:58:44,842 --> 01:58:46,503
DECEMBER 21, 1960

972
01:58:46,711 --> 01:58:48,576
LAST DAY OF DEMONSTRATIONS

973
01:58:49,247 --> 01:58:50,908
Listen to me!

974
01:58:52,951 --> 01:58:54,919
Return to your homes!

975
01:58:57,755 --> 01:58:59,985
What do you want?

976
01:59:05,263 --> 01:59:06,992
Independence!

977
01:59:07,231 --> 01:59:09,324
Our pride!

978
01:59:11,636 --> 01:59:13,365
We want our freedom!

979
02:00:21,439 --> 02:00:24,602
Two more years of struggle
still lay ahead.

980
02:00:24,842 --> 02:00:28,801
Then, on July 2, 1962,
with its independence,

981
02:00:29,013 --> 02:00:31,447
the Algerian nation was born.

982
02:01:05,583 --> 02:01:08,552
