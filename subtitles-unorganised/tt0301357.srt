1
00:00:41,762 --> 00:00:45,140
Our holiday home, Summer 1978

2
00:00:46,016 --> 00:00:49,686
Look here. Here into the camera.

3
00:00:52,564 --> 00:00:55,442
Hands off!

4
00:00:59,404 --> 00:01:02,407
Alex, hold on!
- Dad, help me!

5
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:26,740
Slowly, cautiously,
almost gently...

6
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:32,329
the giant colossus...
is placed on the launch site.

7
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:36,208
Here on the launch site
the result of the great...

8
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,212
community work is demonstrated.
If you want an example to emphasize the famous word:

9
00:02:40,254 --> 00:02:42,089
everyone supplies quality to everyone...
- There he is!

10
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:44,383
everyone supplies quality to everyone...
- There he is!

11
00:02:44,383 --> 00:02:47,260
... here it can be seen in perfection.

12
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:53,517
I report: I am ready for the flight
with spaceship SOJUS 31...

13
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:57,687
as a member of the international
crew.

14
00:02:57,813 --> 00:03:01,107
On August 26, 1978,
we had reached international standing.

15
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:08,448
Sigmund Jhn, citizen of the GDR,
was the first German who ever went into space.

16
00:03:08,448 --> 00:03:11,284
However, on this day our
family went really up in smoke.

17
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:13,203
This is your husband's third stay
in a capitalistic country.

18
00:03:13,203 --> 00:03:15,205
This is your husband's third stay
in a capitalistic country.

19
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:18,249
He stands in for his boss, professor Klinger.

20
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:22,253
Do you know of any contacts in the West
your husband might have?. - No.

21
00:03:22,337 --> 00:03:26,925
Mrs Kerner, how would you
describe the state of your marriage?

22
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:32,180
Has your husband ever talked to you
about escape from the Republic?

23
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:36,100
Mrs Kerner...
Has he talked to you about that?

24
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:43,232
Allow me to present the Central Committee
of the communist party...

25
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:47,111
Get lost! Leave me alone!

26
00:03:48,654 --> 00:03:52,617
While Sigmund Jhn bravely represented the GDR
in the depths of space,

27
00:03:52,658 --> 00:03:56,579
my procreator let a class enemy
in a capitalistic country...

28
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,957
screw his brains out.
He never came back.

29
00:03:59,957 --> 00:04:00,249
screw his brains out.
He never came back.

30
00:04:02,835 --> 00:04:06,839
My mother became so sad,
that she stopped talking.

31
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:11,468
She just didn't talk anymore.
Not to us, not to others.

32
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:23,814
Mum, please come back.
It's so boring at Mrs. Schfer's.

33
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:28,610
Mum, I love you.

34
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:45,168
The Sandman excellently adapted to the
conditions in space.

35
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:49,214
But the biggest surprise was that he
became very well acquainted...

36
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:52,134
...with Mascha.

37
00:04:52,217 --> 00:04:55,011
We even had a cosmic
marriage on board.

38
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:56,388
We even had a cosmic
marriage on board.

39
00:04:56,388 --> 00:05:01,685
In a few minutes, the sandman
and Mascha will come back to Earth.

40
00:05:01,685 --> 00:05:06,940
I hope it was relayed,
so that you could see it clearly.

41
00:05:08,024 --> 00:05:12,195
Mother came back after 8 weeks.
It was as if she had been transformed.

42
00:05:12,237 --> 00:05:15,240
Surprise!
- My sweeties!

43
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:23,706
My Alex. My little cosmonaut.

44
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:44,936
(Caption) Pioneer Park, Spring 1979
- We never talked about father again.

45
00:05:44,936 --> 00:05:47,271
(Caption) Pioneer Park, Spring 1979
- We never talked about father again.

46
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:53,027
From this moment on, my mother got married
to our socialist Fatherland.

47
00:05:56,697 --> 00:05:59,200
Our home...

48
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:03,245
is not only
the towns and villages...

49
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:07,249
As this relation was not a sexual one,
there was a lot of vigour and energy left...

50
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:11,211
for us kids
and the socialist daily routine.

51
00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:16,717
... is the grass on the sward,
the corn on the field and the birds...

52
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:18,010
in the air and the animals on the ground...

53
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,387
in the air and the animals on the ground...

54
00:06:20,387 --> 00:06:24,224
My mother became promoter of
the progress of society.

55
00:06:24,224 --> 00:06:28,562
A passionate activist for the
simple needs of the people

56
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:29,980
and against the small
injustices of life. - Input.

57
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,523
and against the small
injustices of life. - Input.

58
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:32,858
and against the small
injustices of life. - Input.

59
00:06:32,858 --> 00:06:36,236
Concerning: Gaudily colourful...

60
00:06:36,236 --> 00:06:39,114
maternity dresses. Full-stop.

61
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:48,206
And now a report on the solemn honouring...
- This is it!

62
00:06:48,248 --> 00:06:49,040
Blue- and and white-collar workers,
scientists and joint farmers,

63
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,085
Blue- and and white-collar workers,
scientists and joint farmers,

64
00:06:52,085 --> 00:06:55,922
artists and veteran workers
came to Berlin today,

65
00:06:55,922 --> 00:07:00,719
to receive the highest honourings
of our country in the Council of State.

66
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:01,428
to receive the highest honourings
of our country.

67
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:04,264
That's you, Mum!

68
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:08,309
... and recognition of outstanding
merits during the building up...

69
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,564
and development
of the socialist social order.

70
00:07:12,605 --> 00:07:16,568
On the eve of the
national holiday...

71
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:20,613
the CC of the SUG
traditionally rewards men and women of merit.

72
00:07:21,823 --> 00:07:26,160
After a long, untiring training
it was time. I, Alex Kerner,

73
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,456
was the second German to go to space.
Deeper and further than any man before.

74
00:07:30,456 --> 00:07:33,334
Rocket launched!

75
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:38,673
I imaged how I would explore the riddles of the cosmos
for the good of humanity,

76
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:42,677
how I would look down to our planet
and how I would proudly wave to my mother.

77
00:07:42,677 --> 00:07:44,387
how I would look down to our planet
and how I would proudly wave to my mother.

78
00:07:44,387 --> 00:07:46,806
Rocket launched!

79
00:08:05,324 --> 00:08:08,911
10 years later - October 7, 1989.

80
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:12,373
Test, one, two...

81
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:15,167
The GDR had its 40th anniversary.

82
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,213
I had a day off with the
PGH TV workshop "Adolf Hennecke"...

83
00:08:19,254 --> 00:08:23,842
and felt as if I was on the climax of
my male personal magnetism.

84
00:08:23,842 --> 00:08:25,177
and felt as if I was on the climax of
my male personal magnetism.

85
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:36,021
Left, two, three!

86
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:40,066
Time smelt of change,
while an oversized rifle association...

87
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:45,363
had its last performance
in front of our house.

88
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,294
Alex!

89
00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:02,839
What?

90
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:05,258
Alex, there's a lass out there.
Should I send her away?

91
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:07,427
Alex, there's a lass out there.
Should I send her away?

92
00:09:07,427 --> 00:09:10,305
Who is she?
- No idea.

93
00:09:10,305 --> 00:09:13,182
But she makes a good impression.

94
00:09:16,227 --> 00:09:19,689
Have you slept in your clothes again?

95
00:09:19,731 --> 00:09:22,191
Where's the visitor?

96
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:26,195
The visitor's name is Paula...
and it's a date, as agreed. Here you are.

97
00:09:26,237 --> 00:09:29,115
Oh no!
- Oh yes, little brother.

98
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:33,619
Can't your ex-boyfriend take care of her?
- He's on standby duty today.

99
00:09:49,677 --> 00:09:52,054
We stopped at: ...but a woman
of a certain age...

100
00:09:52,054 --> 00:09:53,889
We stopped at: ...but a woman
of a certain age...

101
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:59,311
... can't and won't wear the panties,
that are offered.

102
00:09:59,353 --> 00:10:03,983
Fullstop. Even in the GDR, there
are not only young princesses on ice and...

103
00:10:04,024 --> 00:10:08,028
exquisitly slim comrades. Full-stop.
- That's good.

104
00:10:08,237 --> 00:10:09,613
You're not downstairs? It's already started.
- Impossible to overhear!

105
00:10:09,613 --> 00:10:12,241
You're not downstairs? It's already started.
- Impossible to overhear!

106
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:16,078
Well hurry up then. It could be the last time
with these members.

107
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,414
Where's Paula?
- Yeah, where is she? Sleeping again?

108
00:10:19,414 --> 00:10:21,333
Maybe I'll see your
mother on TV. - In the palace?

109
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,877
Maybe I'll see your
mother on TV. - In the palace?

110
00:10:24,628 --> 00:10:27,631
You'll have to look for her with a magnifying glass.

111
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:33,678
I don't really know if I'll go there.
All of the party's bigwigs are there.

112
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,642
I don't know anyone. Although... I'd like
to see Gorbatschow at close range this once.

113
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:44,189
There they are celebrating themselves,
all the old bastards.

114
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,276
Well you don't have to watch.
- Mum, don't you notice what's happening there?

115
00:10:48,318 --> 00:10:51,321
And you, what do you want? Do a bunk?

116
00:10:52,113 --> 00:10:56,701
Nothing will change if
they all go away. Let's go on.

117
00:10:57,535 --> 00:11:02,165
It cannot be possible,
that the stouter...

118
00:11:02,248 --> 00:11:06,210
...workers and farmer's wifes...
are punished by the fashion combinates...

119
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:10,173
...after the 40th year of the existence
of our Republic!

120
00:11:10,214 --> 00:11:13,092
With socalist salutations...

121
00:11:13,217 --> 00:11:15,845
Hanna Schfer.

122
00:11:23,978 --> 00:11:28,065
In the evening of October 7, 1989
several hundred people united...

123
00:11:28,065 --> 00:11:31,902
for an evening walk,
to promote...

124
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:35,740
the idea of walking without borders.

125
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,201
Freedom of the press! Freedom of the press!

126
00:12:00,723 --> 00:12:03,600
Cough! Cough hard!

127
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,312
Everything alright?

128
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:12,526
You alright?
- Thank you!

129
00:12:23,245 --> 00:12:26,832
There're even more Greens.

130
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,668
Alright already!

131
00:12:32,212 --> 00:12:35,090
Form a chain!

132
00:12:35,215 --> 00:12:38,426
No violence! No violence!

133
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:45,558
You might make it
if you take the subway.

134
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:58,655
What's your name?

135
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:00,281
La...

136
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,654
Stop it!

137
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:43,324
Watch out!

138
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:04,928
That's my mum lying there!
- Stand still! - My mum's lying there!

139
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:21,319
Let me go, you asshole!
That's my mu......

140
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,809
Alexander Kerner?
- Yes?

141
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,608
Your mother.

142
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,454
What about mother?

143
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,293
What is it?

144
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,504
Mum had a heart attack.

145
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:10,594
Unfortunately, the resuscitation attempts were carried out
very late. Your mother's in a coma.

146
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,809
When can we talk to her?
- Alex, Mum's in a coma!

147
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:22,898
Mr. Kerner, we don't know yet,
whether or not your mother will ever wake up again.

148
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:56,889
Can you hear me, Mum?

149
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:00,476
You've got to wake up!

150
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,522
But mother was fast asleep.
In her deep, neverending sleep...

151
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:08,568
she circled like a satellite
around the events happening...

152
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:13,823
on our little planet
in our even smaller Republic.

153
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:19,912
The 9th Convention agreed to Honecker's request,
to relieve him of his duties...

154
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:24,708
because of health problems
and thanked him for his political life's work.

155
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,127
Congratulations!

156
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:28,087
Her sleep obscured the retirement of
the esteemed comrade Erich Honecker,

157
00:17:28,087 --> 00:17:30,381
Her sleep obscured the retirement of
the esteemed comrade Erich Honecker,

158
00:17:30,422 --> 00:17:36,095
General Secretary of the CC of the SUG
and Chairman of the GDR's council of state.

159
00:17:38,806 --> 00:17:42,810
(Reporter) Berlin.
This evening the Wall fell.

160
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:45,187
(German National Anthem) Unity and Justice
and Liberty...

161
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:47,272
(German National Anthem) Unity and Justice
and Liberty...

162
00:17:47,272 --> 00:17:52,611
Mother slept through a classical concert
at the City Hall of Schneberg.

163
00:17:52,611 --> 00:17:57,366
And the start of a gigantic and
unique waste collection.

164
00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:57,908
And the start of a gigantic and
unique waste collection.

165
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:05,415
Open the gateway!

166
00:18:05,457 --> 00:18:08,877
Stasi begone! Stasi begone!

167
00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:11,755
Mother kept on sleeping. Deeply and firmly.

168
00:18:13,173 --> 00:18:17,010
She missed my
first trip into the West,

169
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:21,473
and how some comrades conscientiously
protected us workers and peasants.

170
00:18:21,473 --> 00:18:23,266
and how some comrades conscientiously
protected us workers and peasants.

171
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:27,103
Of course she also missed my
first cultural discoveries

172
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:29,981
in a new country.

173
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:33,359
Excuse me, excuse me.

174
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:34,194
Excuse me, excuse me.

175
00:18:36,237 --> 00:18:40,950
Mothers deep sleep didn't allow her
to participate in the first free polling.

176
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:44,871
Helmut! Helmut! Helmut!

177
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:49,167
She missed how Ariane gave up her study
of economic theory...

178
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:52,045
Enjoy your meal and thank you for choosing Burger King.

179
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:56,174
... and made her first practical experience
with the circulation of money.

180
00:18:56,215 --> 00:19:01,179
The sleep saved her the moving-in of Ariane's new boyfriend.
Rainer, class enemy and barbecue man.

181
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,265
The furniture from the bedroom
is going to the basement.

182
00:19:04,265 --> 00:19:06,934
The furniture from the bedroom
is going to the basement.

183
00:19:06,934 --> 00:19:10,771
She missed the increasing Westernization of
our 79-square-metre apartment...

184
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:15,109
The old rubbish with the red dot
is going to the bulk waste, okay?

185
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:15,609
The old rubbish with the red dot
is going to the bulk waste, okay?

186
00:19:18,446 --> 00:19:24,243
... and Rainer's enthusiasm for the
oriental customs and way of life.

187
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:31,166
The big hormanal ecstasy
that I experienced watching

188
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:35,212
a few beautiful legs,
didn't reach into her night.

189
00:19:44,388 --> 00:19:46,181
Shit!

190
00:19:52,563 --> 00:19:56,191
What're you doing there?
- I... the infusion...

191
00:19:56,233 --> 00:20:00,404
And not even the first day of Nurse Lara
exchange angel from the sovjet union,

192
00:20:00,445 --> 00:20:03,573
penetrated her black dreams.

193
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:09,329
There you are again.
- Hello.

194
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:16,628
I was worried about you.
- They've put me in clink.

195
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:34,229
Mother overslept the triumph of
the capitalism. - Relief!

196
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:45,823
And the coordination of
my hospital visits.

197
00:21:08,721 --> 00:21:12,641
Do you know what I noticed?
When she's in a good mood,

198
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:17,980
she's carrying her hair loosely.
When she's in a bad mood, she puts them up.

199
00:21:18,022 --> 00:21:22,026
And during the doctor's round,
she chews on her fingernails.

200
00:21:24,612 --> 00:21:29,199
Don't you think
she's got a beautiful smile?

201
00:21:31,952 --> 00:21:33,454
Her sleep ignored,
how heroes of work became unemployed.

202
00:21:33,454 --> 00:21:36,123
Her sleep ignored,
how heroes of work became unemployed.

203
00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:40,002
The PGH TV workshop "Adolf Hennecke"
was winded up.

204
00:21:40,002 --> 00:21:44,298
I was the last one
and I switched off the light.

205
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:48,677
Then there was the reprise. As a member of the
quick-witted East-West-Team, I applied the reunification very early.

206
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:52,681
Satellite dishes blossomed
in our landscape.

207
00:21:52,723 --> 00:21:55,183
Denis Domaschke?

208
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:58,228
Domaschke. Denis Domaschke.

209
00:22:01,106 --> 00:22:03,984
Alexander Kerner?
- Here.

210
00:22:03,984 --> 00:22:06,403
Well, come on. Don't be shy.

211
00:22:06,403 --> 00:22:07,195
Well, come on. Don't be shy.

212
00:22:07,237 --> 00:22:08,822
Hi.

213
00:22:09,614 --> 00:22:12,492
And get along, guys.

214
00:22:13,034 --> 00:22:15,620
Hi.
- Hello.

215
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:23,837
Knut Vogel?

216
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:31,177
Hello, Mum. Doctor Wagner said
we should talk to you.

217
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:35,181
And if I can't be there in person,
I thought it might work like this too.

218
00:22:35,223 --> 00:22:39,185
It's 5 o' clock now.
Most of the doctors are gone

219
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:43,189
and you've finally got some peace.
Nurse Lara, who's washed you,

220
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:47,193
should be gone too. If you could see her
you'd surely wake up.

221
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:52,156
Ariane sends you her regards,
she thinks the idea with the tape is nonsense. Well, you know her.

222
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,160
She's just in the room taking care of Paula who's
getting her teeths and is screaming all the time.

223
00:22:56,202 --> 00:23:00,164
Mother overslept my
unstoppable progress with Lara.

224
00:23:00,206 --> 00:23:06,170
Our first romantic rendez-vous followed
4 early shifts and 35 late shifts.

225
00:23:27,775 --> 00:23:29,777
It's loud here!

226
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:50,589
Our Russian teacher came from Minsk
and weighed a ton.

227
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:54,593
And that's all you know
about Russian women?

228
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:04,436
The wind of change blew
into the ruins of our Republic.

229
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:08,440
Summer came and Berlin was
the most beautiful place on Earth.

230
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,402
We felt like
being in the center of the world.

231
00:24:12,444 --> 00:24:16,906
Where finally something moved.
And we moved with it.

232
00:24:16,948 --> 00:24:20,827
It's too bad she doesn't
realize any of this.

233
00:24:21,202 --> 00:24:25,164
Well, maybe it's better that way.
Everything she believed in

234
00:24:25,206 --> 00:24:28,167
has dissolved into air in a few months.
Just like that.

235
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:31,087
And your dad?
- He was a Doctor.

236
00:24:32,922 --> 00:24:36,926
He escaped into the West.
We haven't heard anything from him again.

237
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:22,805
The future was in our hands,
uncertain and promising.

238
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:34,024
Good afternoon. We're X TV and we just wanted to...

239
00:25:34,691 --> 00:25:37,653
Hello, do you need a satellite dish?

240
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:40,238
No money?

241
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:42,324
Good afternoon!

242
00:25:42,616 --> 00:25:45,619
Do you like football? Then we've got something for you.

243
00:25:46,203 --> 00:25:49,080
Good afternoon. We're X TV and...

244
00:25:49,456 --> 00:25:53,084
We're X TV!
Are you interested in a satellite dish?

245
00:25:53,126 --> 00:25:57,172
This is Vietnam 1, there's Vietnam 2
and back there's the Viatnamese sport channel.

246
00:25:57,214 --> 00:25:58,840
Alright!

247
00:26:03,678 --> 00:26:07,557
To the World Cup!
- To the future! - To us!

248
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:09,726
Comrade!

249
00:26:18,693 --> 00:26:22,572
At the moment this is just running
on the side.

250
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:28,453
And later...
I'll do real feature films.

251
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:34,709
Same label of course.

252
00:26:34,709 --> 00:26:36,127
Watch this, I'll just show you something.

253
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,795
Watch this, I'll just show you something.

254
00:26:40,006 --> 00:26:43,593
That's what I'm working on at the moment. Watch this!

255
00:26:45,219 --> 00:26:48,806
Don't look yet.
Don't look yet, wait...

256
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:52,685
And... now!

257
00:27:08,325 --> 00:27:10,911
Recognized it?

258
00:27:22,714 --> 00:27:24,508
Now!

259
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:32,683
That's the famous cut from 2001,
the one with the bone.

260
00:27:32,724 --> 00:27:35,727
The cake represents the spaceship.

261
00:27:40,315 --> 00:27:43,276
Got it now? Yes?
- Ingenious.

262
00:27:54,704 --> 00:27:56,706
Ingenious.

263
00:28:01,211 --> 00:28:02,837
Alright, everybody laugh.

264
00:28:02,837 --> 00:28:04,464
Alright, everybody laugh.

265
00:28:04,464 --> 00:28:09,260
At the beginning of June 1990, the borders
of our GDR were worthless.

266
00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:18,227
Mother kept on sleeping. But I
remembered the old words of the comrades:

267
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:22,231
"We solve problems by making headway"
and I acted.

268
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,184
Mum?

269
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,353
Mum!

270
00:29:03,314 --> 00:29:05,899
Can you hear me?

271
00:29:11,947 --> 00:29:15,909
Your mother's awakening is a wonder.
But she might not be the same person she used to be.

272
00:29:15,993 --> 00:29:18,453
What do you mean?

273
00:29:18,495 --> 00:29:22,541
There have been some cases in which
the patients didn't recognize their own children: amnesia.

274
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:25,168
Loss of memory.

275
00:29:25,627 --> 00:29:27,587
Sorry.

276
00:29:27,671 --> 00:29:32,175
Mental confusion. Blending of
long and short-term memory...

277
00:29:32,217 --> 00:29:36,179
Taste and smell irritations,
delayed perception. We don't know,

278
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:41,643
how badly the brain was damaged.
There are a lot of uncertain possibilities.

279
00:29:41,685 --> 00:29:47,482
I'm sorry to have to say this,
but mother is still in great danger.

280
00:29:47,524 --> 00:29:53,154
I'm afraid I can't give you much hope
that she'll survive the next few weeks.

281
00:30:00,703 --> 00:30:02,497
Well...

282
00:30:04,207 --> 00:30:07,961
Can we take...
her home with us?

283
00:30:08,002 --> 00:30:11,714
Out of the question.
She is in very good hands here.

284
00:30:11,756 --> 00:30:16,177
It's also simpler for you.
She can't take another heart attack.

285
00:30:16,219 --> 00:30:20,223
You have to keep your mother
away from any excitement, even any danger of excitement.

286
00:30:20,598 --> 00:30:24,560
And I mean
any form of excitement, Mr. Kerner!

287
00:30:24,602 --> 00:30:27,188
Any excitement.

288
00:30:28,231 --> 00:30:31,108
It's life-threatening.

289
00:30:31,692 --> 00:30:33,194
And this?

290
00:30:33,194 --> 00:30:35,154
And this?

291
00:30:35,154 --> 00:30:38,074
Isn't this a reason to get upset?

292
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:42,370
My mother doesn't know anything about the Fall of the Wall.
She'll find out about that here immediately.

293
00:30:45,873 --> 00:30:46,207
Your granddaughter.

294
00:30:46,207 --> 00:30:48,626
Your granddaughter.

295
00:30:48,626 --> 00:30:51,003
Mummy.

296
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,218
What's happened?
- You collapsed.

297
00:30:58,218 --> 00:30:58,844
What's happened?
- You collapsed.

298
00:30:59,762 --> 00:31:02,348
8 months ago.

299
00:31:02,848 --> 00:31:05,434
8... months ago?

300
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:11,648
I can't... remember.

301
00:31:11,815 --> 00:31:16,403
That's normal. It will come back to you.
You just have to have patience.

302
00:31:16,445 --> 00:31:19,323
And what... what happened?

303
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:24,536
Well, that was...
- It was October.

304
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:28,040
I think you wanted to go shopping.

305
00:31:28,081 --> 00:31:32,169
And... there was a big queue in
front of the store. And it was so hot,

306
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:35,797
you just collapsed.
- In October?

307
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:40,594
It was a really hot October.
Back then.

308
00:31:41,469 --> 00:31:43,054
Yes.

309
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,473
And then?

310
00:31:46,224 --> 00:31:49,102
You were in a coma, Mum.

311
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:56,568
I want to go home.

312
00:31:57,193 --> 00:31:59,654
That I promise you.

313
00:31:59,696 --> 00:32:03,241
We want to celebrate your birthday.
As every year.

314
00:32:03,241 --> 00:32:03,700
We want to celebrate your birthday.
As every year.

315
00:32:04,158 --> 00:32:07,662
Alex, that's complete madness.
- We don't leave her alone, we promised her.

316
00:32:07,704 --> 00:32:11,666
Mum is fatally ill.
It's better for her here. They've got the equipment.

317
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:16,170
Just this once, be realistic.
- No, you be realistic.

318
00:32:16,212 --> 00:32:20,341
What happens when she doesn't have a single room anymore?
Or when someone lets the cat out of the bag?

319
00:32:20,383 --> 00:32:24,637
She'll hear what is happening outside in here.
She won't take it.

320
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:30,184
Alright, all of this rubbish has to come out.

321
00:32:31,936 --> 00:32:35,940
Are mum's curtains still in the basement
- You can't be serious.

322
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:38,859
They're rawlplugged.

323
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:42,363
Oh great!
- Guess it'll have to be re-plastered.

324
00:32:42,363 --> 00:32:43,823
Oh great!
- Guess it'll have to be re-plastered.

325
00:32:43,823 --> 00:32:47,159
Can you please tell me what he's doing?
- What do you think I'm doing?

326
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:50,996
What should I think? - What should he think?
- That you have to make way.

327
00:32:50,996 --> 00:32:54,375
Or should we put Mum in the basement?
- Excuse me, I've paying the rent for this flat for 5 months!

328
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:55,167
Or should we put Mum in the basement?
- Excuse me, I've paying the rent for this flat for 5 months!

329
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:59,171
Generous of you, Rainer! - For the whole apartment!
47,80 German Mark! In the West
that's not even enough for a telephone bill!

330
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:03,175
And in the East you have to wait 10 years to get a telephone connection!
- Can't you just...?

331
00:33:03,217 --> 00:33:07,179
Mum has to find the room
in the same condition she left it in. The doctor said

332
00:33:07,221 --> 00:33:11,183
she has to stay in bad okay?
So it's only about this one room.

333
00:33:11,225 --> 00:33:15,854
And when she's better, we'll see what we'll do.
- You didn't get what the doctor said. Mum will probably...

334
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:19,900
That's what you said 3 months ago,
when you wanted to switch off the machines.

335
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:24,529
That was a different situation, you can't compare this!
- What do you want to tell her then, Ariane?

336
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:29,576
That you've given up your studies,
because you're selling Hamburgers now?

337
00:33:29,618 --> 00:33:35,582
"Enjoy your meal and thank you for choosing Burger King."

338
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:49,095
8th floor?.
- Yeah.

339
00:33:49,095 --> 00:33:51,973
Elevator, hm?
- Broken. - Shit.

340
00:33:51,973 --> 00:33:54,392
You can say that again.

341
00:34:28,217 --> 00:34:28,676
My life changed drastically.

342
00:34:28,676 --> 00:34:31,345
My life changed drastically.

343
00:34:31,345 --> 00:34:35,182
And the day we wanted to take mum home
was ever drawing nearer,

344
00:34:35,182 --> 00:34:38,519
relentlessly like a big Russian tank.

345
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:40,437
What're you doing sniffling in my cupboard?
- Not in your cupboard. That's from the old clothes collection.

346
00:34:40,437 --> 00:34:42,815
What're you doing sniffling in my cupboard?
- Not in your cupboard. That's from the old clothes collection.

347
00:34:42,856 --> 00:34:47,987
And how do you look?
It would be nice if you would think a little for a change.

348
00:34:48,028 --> 00:34:51,323
Look at this. This garbage is what we used to wear.

349
00:34:55,202 --> 00:34:57,788
Sign here.

350
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:01,792
The physiotherapist is coming
3 times a week. Have you got any more questions?

351
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:06,797
Your mother is going at her own responsibility.
You know how I think about this.

352
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,800
Where is the previous Doctor, by the way?

353
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:13,845
Doctor Wagner, he went to Dsseldorf.
- I understand. And you?

354
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,683
When do you run away?
And you want to lecture me about responsibility.

355
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:26,358
Please lie down a second.

356
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:30,820
Why?
- Please. Just lie down.

357
00:35:37,994 --> 00:35:43,666
If there's another cardiac arrest:
short, strong thumps on the chest.

358
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:49,172
Careful! She mustn't wake up.
- Alright, boss!

359
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:53,551
Ariane and I'll set up a schedule.
And there's the physiotherapest.

360
00:35:53,593 --> 00:35:56,638
There's always someone with her. It'll work.

361
00:35:56,679 --> 00:36:01,142
Most GDR citizens already exchanged
their savings cashlessly.

362
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:05,188
There are only 2 weeks left.
You should hurry. Because as Gorbatschow once said:

363
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:08,149
He who is late...
- Excuse me?.

364
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:11,152
will be punished all his life. - I can't hear it anymore.
- Excuse me!

365
00:36:11,194 --> 00:36:15,156
Could you tune down the radio please?
My mother needs rest.

366
00:36:15,197 --> 00:36:17,783
Alright, boss.

367
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:27,084
Don't you want to introduce us?
- Oh yes, of course. This is Lara.

368
00:36:27,126 --> 00:36:29,128
Hello, Lara.

369
00:36:42,224 --> 00:36:45,102
Could you let me past, please?

370
00:36:48,939 --> 00:36:51,525
Hello, Christiane!

371
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:55,237
Alex! What is it?

372
00:36:55,696 --> 00:36:57,698
Hello? Alex!

373
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:12,003
Nothing's changed in here.

374
00:37:13,213 --> 00:37:16,174
What should have changed?

375
00:37:16,216 --> 00:37:20,178
Oh, if you're bored,
you can listen to cassettes.

376
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,181
I'm afraid the radio receiver is broken.

377
00:37:23,348 --> 00:37:26,351
But I'll repair that.
- Alex?

378
00:37:31,272 --> 00:37:35,276
It's good to know
you're not alone.

379
00:37:37,612 --> 00:37:40,490
When your father...

380
00:37:43,743 --> 00:37:46,621
When he was suddenly gone...

381
00:37:47,789 --> 00:37:51,751
I didn't think I'd make it.

382
00:37:56,381 --> 00:37:59,258
I never told you that...

383
00:38:03,262 --> 00:38:07,141
I thought about laying hands upon myself.

384
00:38:12,188 --> 00:38:15,191
But you visited every day.

385
00:38:15,483 --> 00:38:19,487
And you talked about school and Sigmund Jhn.

386
00:38:19,612 --> 00:38:22,490
You heard that?

387
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:29,914
I'm sorry to cause you so much work.

388
00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:33,792
I can't even use the toilet by myself.
- Mum.

389
00:38:34,209 --> 00:38:37,087
That doesn't matter.

390
00:38:37,212 --> 00:38:41,216
The important thing is for you to get well.

391
00:38:41,592 --> 00:38:44,219
I'll try hard.

392
00:38:44,678 --> 00:38:47,556
You have to rest now.

393
00:38:49,683 --> 00:38:53,687
I'll just go to the shop,
but Ariane is still there.

394
00:38:54,771 --> 00:38:57,316
Oh, Alex...?

395
00:38:57,357 --> 00:39:01,737
I'm craving for Spreewood gherkins.
Can you fetch me some?

396
00:39:01,778 --> 00:39:04,197
No problem, Mum.

397
00:39:05,365 --> 00:39:08,243
That's what I thought.

398
00:39:09,995 --> 00:39:15,959
At the end of June 1990 the shops of
our socialist Fatherland were emptied.

399
00:39:16,668 --> 00:39:20,672
Real money was coming in from the country
behind the Wall.

400
00:39:24,217 --> 00:39:28,179
While most citizens queued in long lines in front of the
Republic banks with their usual patience...

401
00:39:28,221 --> 00:39:30,932
we were still frantically looking for mother's bankbook.

402
00:39:30,932 --> 00:39:34,227
we were still frantically looking for mother's bankbook.

403
00:39:44,988 --> 00:39:49,575
Yearned for by everyone, the German Mark flooded
our little community.

404
00:39:49,617 --> 00:39:52,954
Halleluja, Halleluja...

405
00:39:52,995 --> 00:39:55,998
Halleluja, German Mark!

406
00:39:57,667 --> 00:40:00,628
(Song) Such a day, so wonderful...

407
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:04,298
And the money was exchanged 2 to 1.
Germany won 1:0!

408
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:09,679
Unstoppable shot!
Germany is one-nil up by Lothar Matthus!

409
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:27,488
Mocca Fix? - Haven't got that anymore.
Filinchen Crispbread? - Not for sale anymore.

410
00:40:27,655 --> 00:40:31,575
Spreewood gherkins?
- Goodness, where do you live, boy?

411
00:40:31,617 --> 00:40:35,954
We've got the German Mark now. And there you come
asking for Mocca Fix and Filinchen?

412
00:40:35,996 --> 00:40:41,168
Over night, our grey store was transformed
into a colourful product paradise.

413
00:40:41,168 --> 00:40:41,668
Over night, our store was transformed
into a colourful product paradise.

414
00:40:42,211 --> 00:40:45,172
And I became the king as a customer.

415
00:40:45,214 --> 00:40:47,841
They're from the Netherlands.

416
00:40:52,304 --> 00:40:54,890
Good afternoon, Mr. Ganske.

417
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:07,819
That's how far they've driven us already...
that we have to go fishing in the garbage.

418
00:41:08,695 --> 00:41:12,157
Mister Ganske,
have you still got Spreewood gherkins?

419
00:41:12,198 --> 00:41:15,076
What?
- Spreewood gherkins!

420
00:41:15,368 --> 00:41:19,372
I'm sorry, young man.
I'm unemployed myself.

421
00:41:21,207 --> 00:41:24,002
An empty glass would do, too.

422
00:41:48,192 --> 00:41:51,571
I wanted to introduce Rainer to Mum today.

423
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:55,491
Later.
We don't want to demand to much of her.

424
00:42:00,204 --> 00:42:03,082
Perhaps you're right.

425
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:05,751
Yes.

426
00:42:07,003 --> 00:42:11,006
I'm afraid there was a supply shortage
for Spreewood gherkins.

427
00:42:11,215 --> 00:42:14,176
It's alright. These are fine too.

428
00:42:18,347 --> 00:42:22,309
Listen, you really don't have to take
care of me all the time.

429
00:42:22,351 --> 00:42:25,229
It's awkward for me.
- Mum.

430
00:42:25,354 --> 00:42:28,232
No, really. Maybe...

431
00:42:28,691 --> 00:42:33,570
... you could put the TV next to the bed.
Then I'll manage by my own.

432
00:42:33,612 --> 00:42:37,658
Watching TV still is too tiring for you.
- But why? Why shouldn't I...

433
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:43,372
be able to watch TV?
- We'll ask the Doctor.

434
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:48,585
Mum, we have to talk to you about something.

435
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:51,546
It's like this...

436
00:42:51,672 --> 00:42:54,633
We wanted to ask you if...

437
00:42:54,674 --> 00:42:59,262
We need your authorization to access your bank account.
- What is it?

438
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,558
Do you need money?
- No. No.

439
00:43:05,185 --> 00:43:09,147
It's just that you can't go walk
the bank by yourself anymore.

440
00:43:09,189 --> 00:43:12,192
And it would simply be better if...

441
00:43:12,692 --> 00:43:15,653
you sign this.

442
00:43:15,695 --> 00:43:18,281
Yes, and...

443
00:43:18,323 --> 00:43:21,201
maybe now would be best.

444
00:43:25,914 --> 00:43:28,791
But there's no hurry is there?

445
00:43:32,045 --> 00:43:37,050
You're keeping something from me?
Has something happened? Are you in debt?

446
00:43:37,091 --> 00:43:40,094
Please trust us, it's important!

447
00:43:40,136 --> 00:43:46,309
Before I let you have all my money,
I have got a right to know what it's for don't I?

448
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,144
All right.

449
00:43:48,352 --> 00:43:52,356
It was supposed to be
a surprise but...

450
00:43:52,815 --> 00:43:56,402
We received a notification.

451
00:43:56,694 --> 00:43:59,363
From Zwickau.
We can fetch our "Trabant" (GDR car).

452
00:43:59,363 --> 00:44:00,990
From Zwickau.
We can fetch our "Trabant" (GDR car).

453
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:03,409
After only 3 years?

454
00:44:03,409 --> 00:44:07,246
And for that we need the money
that you've saved.

455
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:14,837
You don't think...
I got my money at the bank?

456
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:20,467
I've hidden it.

457
00:44:21,427 --> 00:44:24,054
And where?
- Where?

458
00:44:30,561 --> 00:44:33,438
I forgot.

459
00:44:35,607 --> 00:44:39,611
I've totally forgotten, it's all gone.
- Mum, just think.

460
00:44:49,329 --> 00:44:53,333
Father is coming home late today,
don't you think?

461
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:19,108
Mum...

462
00:45:20,693 --> 00:45:25,281
That's alright.
Soon you'll be better again.

463
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:31,454
We'll celebrate your birthday.
As every year.

464
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:37,418
With the house community.
We have always celebrated it.

465
00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:46,177
This is the First German Television
with the news.

466
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:51,098
Comrade Ganske watches West-TV?

467
00:45:56,354 --> 00:46:00,232
Comrade Ganske fell in love.
During a vacation in Hungary.

468
00:46:00,274 --> 00:46:03,277
With a pensioner from... Munich.

469
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:07,198
Since then his love for the party has suffered.

470
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:09,158
Oh.
- Well...

471
00:46:11,452 --> 00:46:13,412
Are you finished?

472
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:21,628
I'm sorry I'm late again.
- There it is. Even with a balcony.

473
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,756
Since some citizens didn't even return from their
vacation in Hungary,

474
00:46:23,756 --> 00:46:25,466
Since some citizens didn't even return from their
vacation in Hungary,

475
00:46:25,466 --> 00:46:29,803
the apartment market in the Capital eased considerably.

476
00:46:29,803 --> 00:46:33,640
There were deserted apartments everywhere,
which we only had to enter.

477
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,559
The guy moved to the West last year.
A colleague gave me the hint.

478
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,644
The guy moved to the West last year.
A colleague gave me the hint.

479
00:47:32,698 --> 00:47:36,118
Get a load of that! - Get a load of that
- It's working! - Tempo-beans!

480
00:47:37,954 --> 00:47:41,791
Globus green peas!
That can't be true.

481
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:46,128
Mocca Fix Gold!
I've been looking for that all the time!

482
00:47:55,221 --> 00:47:57,223
Can I have that?

483
00:48:29,379 --> 00:48:32,007
I have to go.

484
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,345
Sleep on...

485
00:49:00,952 --> 00:49:03,246
Morning, Mum.

486
00:49:03,288 --> 00:49:05,874
Morning, Alex.

487
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:10,170
Are you in a hurry?
- I have to go to work.

488
00:49:10,295 --> 00:49:13,131
Alex, please remember the TV.
- Let's talk about that later.

489
00:49:13,131 --> 00:49:14,424
Alex, please remember the TV.
- Let's talk about that later.

490
00:49:14,424 --> 00:49:20,179
Oh and about my birthday.
Invite Klapprath and perhaps a few pupils.

491
00:49:20,179 --> 00:49:24,058
As if the fucking gherkins weren't enough trouble already.
Now she wants to watch TV.

492
00:49:24,183 --> 00:49:28,146
What should I do?
- Yeah, Houston. We got a problem.

493
00:49:30,189 --> 00:49:34,193
Yeah, and now? - I thought you might have an idea.
No, I meant the picture.

494
00:49:34,986 --> 00:49:36,779
Oh.

495
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,619
Now?
- Nope.

496
00:49:43,661 --> 00:49:48,624
It didn't work very long.
- Semi-finale! I'll just go over to the Pollnicks.

497
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:51,252
Then go already.

498
00:49:52,419 --> 00:49:56,131
Excuse me.
Are those gherkins from the Spreewood?

499
00:49:56,215 --> 00:49:58,634
Nope, from the Netherlands.

500
00:50:01,345 --> 00:50:04,348
Just show her something old.
- What do you mean?

501
00:50:05,182 --> 00:50:08,143
Old East-TV stuff on video tape.

502
00:50:08,185 --> 00:50:11,647
News from last year? She'll notice for sure.

503
00:50:11,688 --> 00:50:16,151
Ah, I don't think so. It was always the same rubbish.
- Where should I get the videos from?

504
00:50:16,193 --> 00:50:19,613
I haven't even got a recorder.
- Bad enough.

505
00:50:19,696 --> 00:50:21,323
What's the score?

506
00:50:21,323 --> 00:50:21,782
What's the score?

507
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:26,453
Beckenbauer, Rudi Vller...
You don't want to see it...

508
00:50:28,538 --> 00:50:31,416
Germany made it into the finale!

509
00:50:34,294 --> 00:50:38,256
While the world time clock at the Alexander Square
rushed towards mother's birthday,

510
00:50:38,256 --> 00:50:42,219
a tiny round ball united the social development...

511
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:46,222
of the split nation and let things, that belonged
together, grow together.

512
00:50:46,264 --> 00:50:50,518
I slaved away like a Hero of Labour to resurrect
the GDR in every detail

513
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:54,564
in mother's room until this day.

514
00:50:54,606 --> 00:50:58,610
Have the cross-word puzzles already been solved?
- Untouched like a virgin.

515
00:50:58,651 --> 00:51:01,529
Great. I'll take them all.

516
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:05,408
Oh and these ones too.

517
00:51:06,451 --> 00:51:12,040
They laid my daughter off too.
All of a sudden it was: "Thank you, and goodbye."

518
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:16,377
And for that we worked for 40 years, oh leave me alone......
They'll even drop the TV ballet.

519
00:51:16,377 --> 00:51:18,296
Don't you do anything apart from watching TV?

520
00:51:18,296 --> 00:51:19,172
Don't you do anything apart from watching TV?

521
00:51:19,213 --> 00:51:23,176
To get back to my mother. The problem is that

522
00:51:23,176 --> 00:51:27,180
she doesn't know about the Fall of the Wall
- Enviable.

523
00:51:28,014 --> 00:51:33,936
And it's her birthday next week.
She would really be happy about a visit.

524
00:51:35,187 --> 00:51:39,650
Have you really got it now?
I don't want to hear one false word.

525
00:51:39,692 --> 00:51:42,653
And our 20 Marks?
- The work comes first.

526
00:51:42,695 --> 00:51:47,158
The first guests were invited.
Others still had to be persuaded.

527
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:51,161
A lot of people of the Polytechnical Secondary School
"Werner Seelenbinder"...

528
00:51:51,203 --> 00:51:55,165
had withdrawn to their private lives.
Including Doctor Klapprath.

529
00:51:55,207 --> 00:51:56,417
Once headmaster and outstanding
teacher of the People.

530
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:58,585
Once headmaster and outstanding
teacher of the People.

531
00:51:58,585 --> 00:52:01,964
We were all valuable people.

532
00:52:01,964 --> 00:52:04,341
Isn't that right, Alex?

533
00:52:05,801 --> 00:52:08,178
I admired your mother.
She was an outstanding educator.

534
00:52:08,178 --> 00:52:10,681
I admired your mother.
She was an outstanding educator.

535
00:52:10,722 --> 00:52:13,600
And an excellent human being.

536
00:52:13,851 --> 00:52:16,812
That's why she was neutralized.

537
00:52:19,022 --> 00:52:22,651
Some comrades in the collective
thought her to be too...

538
00:52:23,694 --> 00:52:26,279
idealistic.

539
00:52:26,488 --> 00:52:29,074
Ever since your father...

540
00:52:31,326 --> 00:52:34,287
Her idealism was well-respected, but...

541
00:52:36,206 --> 00:52:40,168
in the daily school routine, it...
can become problematic sometimes.

542
00:52:41,002 --> 00:52:44,005
And then you simply gave her the boot.

543
00:52:49,177 --> 00:52:52,806
You still owe her something.
- Yes.

544
00:52:58,603 --> 00:53:02,440
You're a Dispatcher. Can you remember that?
- Dispatcher? In the East?

545
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,736
Yes, of course in the East. You organize the
purchasing of a Mitropa-Restaurant.

546
00:53:06,736 --> 00:53:10,615
Write this down:
School Education EOS Juri Gagarin.

547
00:53:10,615 --> 00:53:10,990
Write this down:
School Education EOS Juri Gagarin.

548
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:15,161
And you were Group Council Chairman with
the Pioneers. - Group Council... what?

549
00:53:15,203 --> 00:53:18,164
Group Council Chairman.
- That's enough.

550
00:53:18,206 --> 00:53:24,128
I won't use those plastic diapers anymore.
That's going too far.

551
00:53:24,921 --> 00:53:27,924
Got it?
Yes, Group Council Chairman.

552
00:53:28,174 --> 00:53:32,136
Here you are, 30 broadcasts of "Current Camera",
10 broadcasts of "Black Channel"...

553
00:53:32,178 --> 00:53:36,140
6 broadcasts "Colourful Boiler" and 4 broadcasts of
"A Day in the West". It's all copied.

554
00:53:36,182 --> 00:53:40,144
Sponsored by the country's picture library
and a very charming Denis.

555
00:53:40,186 --> 00:53:41,770
I hope that'll work.

556
00:53:45,524 --> 00:53:51,196
What are you doing crawling on the ground?
- That's the cable for the antenna so you can watch TV?

557
00:54:00,664 --> 00:54:05,127
We've got the World Cup. Truly a gift.
There is no better time to

558
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:08,171
supply satellite dishes to the East.

559
00:54:09,006 --> 00:54:11,967
Okay? Got it? We come to phase 3...

560
00:54:18,015 --> 00:54:21,977
What was that?
- No idea. Interferences, happens from time to time.

561
00:54:22,185 --> 00:54:26,148
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen and welcome
to the "Current Camera".

562
00:54:26,189 --> 00:54:31,611
Hard provocation against the border.
Protests in the Chancellor's office in the FRG (West Germany).

563
00:54:31,653 --> 00:54:35,615
Chip-Power GDR.
The foreign press acknowledges achievements...

564
00:54:35,657 --> 00:54:39,619
Things are running outside
and I feel so useless in here.

565
00:54:39,661 --> 00:54:43,623
Can't you put a note on the house community's
pin board?

566
00:54:43,665 --> 00:54:48,545
Whoever's got any problems can come to me.
I can write inputs from bed.

567
00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:52,590
I don't know.
You shouldn't exert yourself.

568
00:54:55,009 --> 00:54:58,596
Morning, Alex. Is it time already?

569
00:55:07,355 --> 00:55:10,358
You want a swig? You want a swig?
- Oh holy shit!

570
00:55:13,194 --> 00:55:16,072
Shit. Shit, yes? Shit!

571
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:19,408
Goodness, goddamn shit!

572
00:55:33,923 --> 00:55:36,509
I feel sick.

573
00:55:41,597 --> 00:55:43,307
While many loudly thought of themself
being the World Cup holders of tomorrow,

574
00:55:43,307 --> 00:55:45,643
While many loudly thought of themself
being the World Cup holders of tomorrow,

575
00:55:45,643 --> 00:55:48,979
sounds from the past
came out of mother's bedroom.

576
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:53,776
Our home
is not only the towns...

577
00:55:53,776 --> 00:55:55,235
and villages...

578
00:55:56,195 --> 00:56:01,158
Our home is also
all the trees in the forest...

579
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,827
Our home...

580
00:56:04,203 --> 00:56:08,957
is the grass on the sward,
the corn on the field...

581
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,669
and the birds...

582
00:56:12,919 --> 00:56:17,966
in the air and the animals on the ground...

583
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:23,972
and the fishes in the river are the home...

584
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:26,808
And we love the...

585
00:56:33,732 --> 00:56:37,360
That was wonderful. Thank you. Thank you, children.

586
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:41,197
You learned that from me, didn't you?

587
00:56:43,408 --> 00:56:44,993
Yes.

588
00:56:48,913 --> 00:56:51,207
Dear Christiane!

589
00:56:51,249 --> 00:56:54,210
We are here... today... here,

590
00:56:54,335 --> 00:56:58,214
because it's your birthday.
And... I would like to wish...

591
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:03,469
you all the best
in the name of the party direction.

592
00:57:05,179 --> 00:57:06,973
And...

593
00:57:08,307 --> 00:57:10,101
the basket.

594
00:57:12,353 --> 00:57:14,146
For you.

595
00:57:15,022 --> 00:57:18,025
That's kind of you. Thank you.

596
00:57:19,652 --> 00:57:21,737
Klapprath.

597
00:57:21,779 --> 00:57:25,366
Rosenthaler Kadarka... Mocca Fix Gold...

598
00:57:26,992 --> 00:57:29,578
Globus green peas.

599
00:57:30,663 --> 00:57:33,666
The colleagues and... the comrades...

600
00:57:36,043 --> 00:57:39,004
of the POS "Werner Seelenbinder"... they...

601
00:57:40,172 --> 00:57:44,176
would like to thank you in particular
for all the years,

602
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:47,971
Christiane, that you... were...

603
00:57:50,015 --> 00:57:52,893
a... good colleague...

604
00:57:53,602 --> 00:57:56,480
and... a dear comrade...

605
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:00,776
uhm...

606
00:58:02,194 --> 00:58:06,448
And anyway, I wish you all the best
for your birthday and remain the same person you are...

607
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:08,492
Christiane.

608
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:19,336
Dear comrade Kerner...

609
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:23,298
All the best...

610
00:58:23,757 --> 00:58:26,343
and... good health...

611
00:58:26,926 --> 00:58:30,513
and that everything will be
as it used to be again.

612
00:58:34,059 --> 00:58:36,644
Lara, come here.

613
00:58:40,982 --> 00:58:43,568
This is Lara.

614
00:58:43,735 --> 00:58:46,738
An exchange student from the Soviet Union.

615
00:58:47,655 --> 00:58:50,658
Her dad is a teacher for the deaf and dumb.

616
00:58:51,993 --> 00:58:55,580
Don't marry him too early.
- Mum.

617
00:58:55,997 --> 00:58:59,876
Even though the thing with the flat
will work out earlier then.

618
00:59:01,252 --> 00:59:05,131
My Alex can be
a real block-head sometimes.

619
00:59:07,258 --> 00:59:09,844
And Rainer...

620
00:59:10,011 --> 00:59:13,639
that's my Ariane's new boyfriend.

621
00:59:14,181 --> 00:59:17,059
He... he is a...

622
00:59:17,685 --> 00:59:21,272
Dispatcher.
- Right, I'm a Dispatcher.

623
00:59:22,314 --> 00:59:26,861
I used to be with them myself...
All the best from the heart... Pioneers!

624
00:59:26,902 --> 00:59:30,864
I used to be with the
Free German Pioneers...

625
00:59:30,906 --> 00:59:33,158
Thank you, Rainer.

626
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,786
As a Group... um...

627
00:59:36,203 --> 00:59:37,997
Cha...

628
00:59:38,205 --> 00:59:41,166
Group Chairman... back then...
- Thank you!

629
00:59:42,876 --> 00:59:46,463
Be ready, be ready!
- Thank you, Rainer!

630
00:59:50,175 --> 00:59:54,179
Yes, Mum. Another year is over.
What's changed?

631
00:59:55,264 --> 00:59:59,851
Not much really.
Paula got her teeth and a new dad.

632
01:00:00,977 --> 01:00:02,938
And me... yes.

633
01:00:02,979 --> 01:00:07,234
Unfortunately, we cannot go over to
the Caf Moskow to drink to your health,

634
01:00:07,234 --> 01:00:11,071
but we're all together.
And that's the most important thing.

635
01:00:11,071 --> 01:00:14,908
We didn't always make it easy for you,
but you were always there for us.

636
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:19,162
And, by any rate, I can't think of
a better family than ours.

637
01:00:19,204 --> 01:00:23,625
And that's what I wanted to thank you for.
Mum, you're the best mother in the world.

638
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:26,628
Alex?
- And we all love you.

639
01:00:26,669 --> 01:00:29,255
Alex?.
- What's the matter?

640
01:00:29,672 --> 01:00:32,258
What's that?

641
01:00:34,677 --> 01:00:37,639
That's...
- Yes, what's the meaning of that?

642
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,643
I don't know what the comrades are doing there again...
A fata morgana.

643
01:00:41,684 --> 01:00:46,856
That's from the West.
- It's a mirage.

644
01:00:49,984 --> 01:00:55,281
It will have been approved somehow.
- Please calm down, Mum!

645
01:00:55,364 --> 01:00:58,326
There's an explanation for everything. Right...

646
01:00:59,994 --> 01:01:02,997
Boys, please sing something, will you?

647
01:01:03,289 --> 01:01:06,292
Lara! Wait a moment, I... Lara?.

648
01:01:08,044 --> 01:01:11,630
"Build up, build up".

649
01:01:13,924 --> 01:01:15,593
What's the matter all of a sudden?

650
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:20,556
Build up.
For a better future...

651
01:01:20,973 --> 01:01:23,517
we build up our home...

652
01:01:23,642 --> 01:01:28,814
I'm sorry for your mother.
What you're doing is too scary for me.

653
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:35,154
And what is this nonsense
about my father being a teacher for the deaf and dumb.

654
01:01:35,195 --> 01:01:39,241
He was a simple cook, you know that.
- But she rejoiced in that.

655
01:01:39,283 --> 01:01:44,454
What should I've told her?
That he's dead? In her state?

656
01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:51,461
You mean to say, when you're lying already,
it doesn't make any difference anyway.

657
01:01:51,503 --> 01:01:55,132
Cheers for her,
cheers for her...

658
01:01:55,173 --> 01:01:56,967
Lara!

659
01:01:57,676 --> 01:02:01,263
Cheers for her,
cheers for her...

660
01:02:01,596 --> 01:02:04,182
three cheers for her!

661
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:07,561
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

662
01:02:17,946 --> 01:02:19,864
Just a little further away.

663
01:02:19,864 --> 01:02:20,865
Just a little further away.

664
01:02:21,366 --> 01:02:23,535
Just a little more..

665
01:02:23,576 --> 01:02:27,539
Watch out, will you? We're filming here!
- Can I see your authorization?

666
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:31,167
Didn't he inform you?
- Me? Who?

667
01:02:32,168 --> 01:02:35,129
Oh, what was his name?
- Something with "M".

668
01:02:35,171 --> 01:02:39,175
I'll just go and ask around.
Until then, you don't film anything!

669
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:44,347
Got the logo? - Yes.
Sharpness on me?- Yes.

670
01:02:47,767 --> 01:02:51,729
We're waiting for the evening sun.
- Don't overdo it, the guy will be back soon.

671
01:02:51,771 --> 01:02:55,691
Just you wait.
With the evening sun it'll look brill.

672
01:02:56,192 --> 01:03:00,154
When I stared at the clouds on that day,
I realized that the truth

673
01:03:00,196 --> 01:03:04,158
was just a doubtful matter,
that I could adapt to mother's

674
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,117
familiar surroundings.

675
01:03:05,117 --> 01:03:06,911
familiar surroundings.

676
01:03:08,329 --> 01:03:12,166
I only had to study the language
of "Current Camera"...

677
01:03:12,166 --> 01:03:16,045
and spur on Denis' ambition
as a film director.

678
01:03:18,047 --> 01:03:22,551
Today Gnther Mittag, secretary for Economy
in the CC of the SUD,

679
01:03:22,593 --> 01:03:26,930
visited the Coca Cola group in West Berlin.
The reason for the comrade's visit are...

680
01:03:26,972 --> 01:03:31,602
details of the completed
trade agreement between Coca Cola...

681
01:03:31,685 --> 01:03:34,646
and the VEB Drink Collective Combine Leipzig.

682
01:03:35,189 --> 01:03:39,693
Security officers of West Berlin hinder
the work of the GDR television.

683
01:03:39,735 --> 01:03:43,697
Surely, the capitalistic press
censors find the loss the mighty

684
01:03:43,739 --> 01:03:47,117
Coca Cola group has suffered against the
VEB Drink Collective Combine Leipzig...

685
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,163
in the patent procedure too embarrassing...
Please let the GDR television

686
01:03:51,204 --> 01:03:55,125
work undisturbed!
- That's it, I'm calling the police!

687
01:03:55,167 --> 01:03:59,129
A testimonial of international
scientists now finally confirmed

688
01:03:59,171 --> 01:04:03,133
to the Collective Combine,
that the original Coca Cola flavour

689
01:04:03,174 --> 01:04:08,221
was developed in the 50s
in laboratories of the GDR. Back to the studio.

690
01:04:08,263 --> 01:04:11,850
Coca Cola is a socialist drink?

691
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:15,603
I thought, Cola existed before the war.

692
01:04:15,645 --> 01:04:19,607
Don't you understand, Mum?
The West ripped us off all these years!

693
01:04:19,649 --> 01:04:23,611
Until the end of August
593 deaths by drugs were registered.

694
01:04:23,653 --> 01:04:27,657
60% more than in the year before.
- Now I remember!

695
01:04:29,742 --> 01:04:32,745
What?
- Where I hid the money.

696
01:04:34,205 --> 01:04:37,125
In the living room. In the small chest of drawers.

697
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:40,628
In the left drawer
under the wax paper.

698
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:44,132
The old rubbish with the red dot
is going to the bulk waste.

699
01:04:44,173 --> 01:04:47,176
How could I forget?

700
01:04:52,682 --> 01:04:55,643
Hey, here I am!
- Oh, hello!

701
01:04:59,021 --> 01:05:00,606
And?

702
01:05:02,525 --> 01:05:05,945
Has she swallowed it?
- Yes, of course. - Really?

703
01:05:05,986 --> 01:05:09,990
Has she really swallowed it?
- I'm telling you.

704
01:05:13,202 --> 01:05:17,164
They've driven us this far!
- Good evening, Mister Ganske.

705
01:05:18,165 --> 01:05:21,126
They betrayed us and sold us out!

706
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:24,630
The lack of sharpness didn't irritate her?
- No.

707
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:28,634
And for that we worked 40 years...
- We could rebuild a studio.

708
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:32,638
We would have different possibilites
with a blue box.

709
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:35,390
What... what are you doing there?

710
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:54,910
And? What should we do with it?
- Exchange it, of course.

711
01:05:56,328 --> 01:05:58,747
I'm sorry, but the deadline expired
2 days ago.

712
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:00,498
I'm sorry, but the deadline expired
2 days ago.

713
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:05,128
But it's a special case.
- We've only just found it today.

714
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:09,132
It's even okay for us,
if you exchange 1 to 4 or 1 to 5...

715
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:13,636
I'm afraid there is no prolongation.
And we wouldn't have exchanged cash anyway.

716
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:16,639
That can't be!
- It has to be possible!

717
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:20,602
I'm sure you heard me. Time's up!
- Your time is up soon, you bastard!

718
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:24,606
These are 30,000 East Marks! That was our money,
for 40 damned years!

719
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:28,609
Now you Western fuck want to tell me,
this isn't worth anything?

720
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:32,238
Please leave our premises now.

721
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:35,658
Keep your hands off! And what are you all gawking at?

722
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,078
It used to be your money, too!

723
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:44,458
Keep your hands off! You assholes!

724
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:53,592
Are you going mad or what?

725
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:58,139
I felt like a Commander
of a submarine in the Northsea-Fleet,

726
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:02,143
whose battle-hardened steel skin
had sprung a leak.

727
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:06,146
Everytime I closed a leak,
another one opened.

728
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:10,150
Ariane denied being my brother in arms,
the class enemy raised his Cola-flag

729
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:15,364
and a fresh wind from the West
blew mother's East money around my ears.

730
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:20,786
What're you laughing about?
- Yell.

731
01:07:20,869 --> 01:07:23,872
Why?
- You have to vent some air.

732
01:07:24,164 --> 01:07:27,167
Open up your valves. Just yell!

733
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:58,615
In Summer 1990, the German
national team exceeded the plan...

734
01:07:58,657 --> 01:08:02,494
and became World Cup holder.

735
01:08:02,702 --> 01:08:05,622
And mother kept on getting better.

736
01:08:05,663 --> 01:08:06,039
The pullover marked "Size 48" has the
width of a "Size 54"

737
01:08:06,039 --> 01:08:09,793
The pullover marked "Size 48" has the
width of a "Size 54"

738
01:08:09,793 --> 01:08:13,129
and the length of a "Size 38". Full-stop.

739
01:08:13,129 --> 01:08:17,926
I don't know how the employees
of Milena come to these measurements.

740
01:08:18,176 --> 01:08:23,848
In the Capital there are no people who
are so small and square. Full-stop.

741
01:08:25,767 --> 01:08:28,644
Christiane, that's good.

742
01:08:29,645 --> 01:08:34,275
If it's our fault...
If it's... our fault...

743
01:08:35,776 --> 01:08:41,741
that we cannot accommodate the Central Plan
with our sizes, comma...

744
01:08:42,366 --> 01:08:45,995
we would like to apologize for that. Full stop.

745
01:08:46,162 --> 01:08:50,124
In this case...
we shall endeavour to become, comma...

746
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:54,170
in the future, smaller and
squarer. Full stop.

747
01:08:56,172 --> 01:08:59,049
With socialist salutations.

748
01:08:59,550 --> 01:09:01,552
Hanna Schfer.

749
01:09:06,181 --> 01:09:08,309
Hello, Mrs. Schfer.

750
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:13,772
Oh Alex. It's so nice to talk to your mother.
It feels just like living in the past.

751
01:09:13,814 --> 01:09:17,776
A little changes here and there
and I'll send it to the OTTO mail-order company.

752
01:09:20,654 --> 01:09:22,781
Our home is also
all the trees in the forest...

753
01:09:22,781 --> 01:09:24,658
Our home is also
all the trees in the forest...

754
01:09:24,658 --> 01:09:27,077
Our home...

755
01:09:31,373 --> 01:09:34,751
I've got some nice visitors.
That's Frank and Christian...

756
01:09:34,751 --> 01:09:37,629
of my former class.
- Hello.

757
01:09:37,671 --> 01:09:41,550
Hello.
Mrs. Kerner has to rest now, alright?

758
01:09:42,467 --> 01:09:45,345
Bye.
- Alex, why?

759
01:09:47,472 --> 01:09:51,434
Now scram!
- And the 20 Marks? - What 20 Marks?

760
01:09:51,476 --> 01:09:55,438
Sascha said,
we'd get 20 Marks for that!

761
01:09:55,647 --> 01:09:59,609
Hello, Mr. Mehlert. - Hello, Alex.
Problems with the toaster?

762
01:09:59,651 --> 01:10:03,947
My mother will be happy,
just go ahead. And you get out of here!

763
01:10:03,988 --> 01:10:09,160
And tell your mates, I don't want to see a Pioneer here ever again. - Alright, boss.

764
01:10:14,666 --> 01:10:17,627
Have you gone nuts?

765
01:10:17,669 --> 01:10:21,631
You can't just let the
boys in here!

766
01:10:21,672 --> 01:10:24,634
But why? She was pleased, wasn't she?

767
01:10:24,675 --> 01:10:30,598
You can't do anything right with you Easties!
Having something to complain about is what matters to you most!

768
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:34,602
You're just like your mother
and her stupid GDR-inputs.

769
01:10:34,644 --> 01:10:36,604
My mother doesn't grumble!
She's trying to change

770
01:10:36,646 --> 01:10:40,608
the conditions of the society step by
step through constructive criticism. - Sure.

771
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:43,611
And you were never interested in that!
- Nope.

772
01:10:43,652 --> 01:10:48,115
Haven't you noticed?
We're in the socialist veteran's club.

773
01:10:48,199 --> 01:10:51,660
Good evening.
Why don't you take admission fees?

774
01:10:51,702 --> 01:10:53,704
Yeah, let's charge admission fees!

775
01:10:53,746 --> 01:10:58,125
You be quiet.
He's bought a Trabbi (GDR car). - Really?

776
01:10:58,167 --> 01:10:59,960
An estate car.

777
01:11:00,169 --> 01:11:04,131
That can't be happening. Paula will get a defect,
if this goes on much longer. - Oh come on!

778
01:11:04,173 --> 01:11:07,634
20 years in the GDR didn't harm
our health, did they?

779
01:11:07,676 --> 01:11:10,637
I've really got my doubts about you.

780
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:13,765
Shit. Shit!

781
01:11:18,729 --> 01:11:21,315
Well done. Get a cloth.

782
01:11:36,163 --> 01:11:39,166
What is it? Nosebleeds again.

783
01:11:45,171 --> 01:11:49,134
I know it's a little stressful at the moment
I'd also prefer,

784
01:11:49,175 --> 01:11:54,389
if we didn't have to...
- I saw dad... earlier.

785
01:11:55,598 --> 01:11:58,184
Where?.
- At work.

786
01:11:59,686 --> 01:12:02,689
I recognized his voice immediately.

787
01:12:02,814 --> 01:12:05,316
What did he say?

788
01:12:05,483 --> 01:12:07,527
3 cheeseburgers and
2 portions of chips with mayonnaise, please.

789
01:12:07,527 --> 01:12:09,279
3 cheeseburgers and
2 portions of chips with mayonnaise, please.

790
01:12:13,616 --> 01:12:16,994
Um, 3 cheeseburgers and
2 portions of chips with mayonnaise!

791
01:12:31,509 --> 01:12:34,387
And... what does he look like?

792
01:12:36,764 --> 01:12:41,393
He drives a Volvo estate car and
got glasses with a golden rim.

793
01:12:43,187 --> 01:12:46,065
What did you tell him?

794
01:12:46,982 --> 01:12:51,195
Enjoy your meal and thank you
for choosing Burger King.

795
01:12:54,281 --> 01:12:58,285
Enjoy your meal and thank you
for choosing Burger King.

796
01:13:22,559 --> 01:13:26,938
My father lived somewhere in this City.
I saw his image in my mind.

797
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:32,944
A fat guy who stuffed himself with cheeseburgers
and chips all day.

798
01:13:40,327 --> 01:13:43,788
He lived in his world and I lived in mine.

799
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:47,792
He didn't have anything to do with me
and I didn't have anything to do with him.

800
01:13:56,176 --> 01:13:59,512
Hold still or it won't work.

801
01:13:59,596 --> 01:14:02,557
Will it take much longer?

802
01:14:05,643 --> 01:14:09,647
'cause I have to be home
in 2 hours at the latest.

803
01:14:10,189 --> 01:14:15,361
You always have to be somewhere in 2 hours.
It's getting boring.

804
01:14:16,195 --> 01:14:20,116
Oh great. I got a sick mother,
a demanding job...

805
01:14:20,157 --> 01:14:24,120
and a miffed girlfriend.
- I've got my exams in 2 days.

806
01:14:24,161 --> 01:14:28,165
It's second nature to you.
This little bit of putting a plaster on.

807
01:14:28,332 --> 01:14:31,335
Then I can stop learning, can't I?

808
01:14:32,878 --> 01:14:36,882
I was well-meant.
I believe in you.

809
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:40,511
Lara, stop this shit, please!

810
01:14:40,594 --> 01:14:43,556
You have to tell your mother!
- What?

811
01:14:43,597 --> 01:14:48,602
You have to tell your mother!
- Not because of me, but because of her!

812
01:14:52,398 --> 01:14:55,025
Lara!
- What?

813
01:14:55,651 --> 01:14:58,237
Shit! Lara!

814
01:15:11,625 --> 01:15:16,004
The life in our little country
became ever faster.

815
01:15:16,004 --> 01:15:21,301
Somehow we were all just like atoms
in a big particle accelerator.

816
01:15:21,301 --> 01:15:23,678
But away from all the frantic pace of the new time
there was a place of quiet,

817
01:15:23,678 --> 01:15:25,138
But away from all the frantic pace of the new time
there was a place of quiet,

818
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:31,144
silence and leisureliness,
where I could finally have a lie-in.

819
01:15:32,687 --> 01:15:38,652
Well, Paula. Alex didn't use to be
so tired when he came home from work.

820
01:15:46,034 --> 01:15:48,995
Our Paula's learning to walk, Alex!

821
01:15:54,459 --> 01:15:56,252
There! There!

822
01:16:15,438 --> 01:16:17,064
There!

823
01:16:21,694 --> 01:16:24,697
See? I can do it, too.

824
01:16:34,248 --> 01:16:36,834
Paula! See?

825
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:44,258
My little Paula. Come to your Granny.
Come, come.

826
01:16:48,554 --> 01:16:52,558
Now we'll show Alex,
what we can do, okay?

827
01:16:53,183 --> 01:16:54,977
Right...

828
01:17:01,275 --> 01:17:05,237
Now let's see just how far
your Granny can walk.

829
01:17:56,496 --> 01:17:59,082
Hi! - Hi!
- Good afternoon.

830
01:18:11,636 --> 01:18:15,139
Young man,
can I just sit down for a moment here please?

831
01:18:15,181 --> 01:18:17,767
Of course.

832
01:18:25,566 --> 01:18:29,487
You're not from here, are you?
- Nope, from Wuppertal.

833
01:18:29,528 --> 01:18:31,530
From the West?

834
01:19:37,762 --> 01:19:39,681
Mum?

835
01:20:38,155 --> 01:20:41,158
Mum, what are you doing? Come on.
- Mum!

836
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:47,831
What is it with you?
You can't just get up! Shit.

837
01:20:51,668 --> 01:20:54,546
What's actually happening here?

838
01:20:58,175 --> 01:21:02,179
Central Committee of the Socialist...
Unity Party of...

839
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:06,016
Germany.

840
01:21:06,975 --> 01:21:09,853
Sound is in order.
- Right.

841
01:21:10,187 --> 01:21:13,607
Right. I'm ready.
- Camera running.

842
01:21:13,648 --> 01:21:15,650
3, 2, 1...

843
01:21:17,611 --> 01:21:19,529
Berlin.

844
01:21:28,663 --> 01:21:30,623
Still running.

845
01:21:30,665 --> 01:21:32,458
Berlin.

846
01:21:32,667 --> 01:21:37,505
In a historic special session of the
Central Committee of the Social Unity Party of Germany...

847
01:21:37,589 --> 01:21:42,343
the General Secretary of the SUG's CC
and Chairman of the GDR's Council of State,

848
01:21:42,427 --> 01:21:46,514
Comrade Erich Honecker, in a great matter of humanitarian politeness,

849
01:21:46,556 --> 01:21:53,104
consented to the entering of the country by people from the FRG
who've been requesting exile at the GDR embassies in Prague and Budapest.

850
01:21:53,187 --> 01:21:55,148
In this development, Honecker sees...

851
01:21:55,189 --> 01:21:57,483
a change in the East-West-relations
and promised every man and woman entering the country...

852
01:21:57,483 --> 01:21:59,360
a change in the East-West-relations
and promised every man and woman entering the country...

853
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:02,238
a welcome money of 200 East Marks.

854
01:22:02,238 --> 01:22:06,075
Unemployment,
bad future prospects...

855
01:22:06,075 --> 01:22:09,912
and the increasing election victories
of the neo-Nazi Republicans...

856
01:22:09,912 --> 01:22:14,125
made the unnerved FRG citizens
turn their backs

857
01:22:14,166 --> 01:22:18,128
on the capitalism to
try and start...

858
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:21,757
a new life in the country of workers and farmers.

859
01:22:24,176 --> 01:22:28,055
Here they park,
the new GDR citizens from the FRG.

860
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:32,142
The entering FRG citizens
were accommodated in the Berlin districts...

861
01:22:32,184 --> 01:22:36,146
"Center" und "Friedrich's Grove".
The CC of the SUG...

862
01:22:36,188 --> 01:22:41,527
created the campaign "Solidarity West"
because of the historic situation,

863
01:22:41,568 --> 01:22:46,114
to make sure all the new citizens
receive proper living space.

864
01:22:46,156 --> 01:22:50,118
Somehow I have to admit
that my game started to break free.

865
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:54,122
Maybe the GDR I created for my mother,
was the one I would have liked to have.

866
01:22:54,164 --> 01:22:58,126
Citizens who are ready
to accommodate a refugee from the FRG,

867
01:22:58,168 --> 01:23:02,631
please report to their
Section Plenipotentiary.

868
01:23:04,508 --> 01:23:07,385
How many are there already?

869
01:23:07,719 --> 01:23:10,597
I don't know. Ten, twenty thousand?

870
01:23:11,181 --> 01:23:15,143
Look at that.
The people want to come into our country.

871
01:23:15,185 --> 01:23:19,147
Where are they all going to live?
- They'll find something.

872
01:23:19,189 --> 01:23:22,150
You've heard it, they're taking care of it.

873
01:23:23,443 --> 01:23:27,447
No, children. This is our responsibility.
We have to help.

874
01:23:28,156 --> 01:23:32,744
But how do you think we can?
I mean, there's no room left in here.

875
01:23:34,245 --> 01:23:37,248
Our holiday home.
- Our holiday home?

876
01:23:38,291 --> 01:23:43,296
We could do it up.
I wanted to get out there anyway.

877
01:23:43,963 --> 01:23:50,178
Congratulations. You've done a great job.
Now she wants to go to the holiday home.

878
01:23:51,637 --> 01:23:55,600
You'll have to redecorate the entire City.
Why don't you start?

879
01:23:55,641 --> 01:23:59,645
But I'm telling you one thing,
I won't take this any further.

880
01:24:01,731 --> 01:24:07,611
Ariane and I'll get a bigger apartment.
In 4 weeks we're out of here.

881
01:24:07,653 --> 01:24:09,905
What?

882
01:24:09,947 --> 01:24:12,575
I'm pregnant.

883
01:24:17,496 --> 01:24:21,500
Again?
Can't you be more careful?

884
01:24:23,585 --> 01:24:26,547
Don't you think Paula is enough? And Mum?

885
01:24:27,172 --> 01:24:32,428
You can't leave me alone!
- Then take some refugees.

886
01:24:32,469 --> 01:24:36,473
You're so cynical.
You want her to die, don't you?

887
01:24:45,565 --> 01:24:50,779
And so the unity of our little
family was restored.

888
01:24:53,156 --> 01:24:56,159
That's your child. And this is the heart.

889
01:25:01,498 --> 01:25:04,084
Amazing!

890
01:25:04,584 --> 01:25:07,587
An all-German baby was on its way.
And all-German contracts...

891
01:25:07,587 --> 01:25:08,964
An all-German baby was on its way.
And all-German contracts...

892
01:25:08,964 --> 01:25:12,801
were signed.
In Moskow, they calculated

893
01:25:12,801 --> 01:25:18,556
that 2 and 4 equals one and drank
Krim Champagne to all-German brotherhood.

894
01:25:18,807 --> 01:25:24,020
In Berlin we took our
first all-German trip.

895
01:25:27,148 --> 01:25:31,110
I'm not a little child anymore.
Please take off the cloth.

896
01:25:31,152 --> 01:25:33,780
Don't look!

897
01:25:34,405 --> 01:25:38,409
Where are we going?
- The surprise stays a surprise!

898
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:43,122
The Trabbi (GDR car) smells so new.
What colour does it have?

899
01:25:43,164 --> 01:25:48,127
You've waited 3 years,
another half an hour won't make a difference. - That's right.

900
01:26:18,991 --> 01:26:20,784
Mum?

901
01:26:35,841 --> 01:26:39,219
Oh, it's beautiful. Sky-blue.

902
01:26:39,219 --> 01:26:42,097
Right, and now turn around.

903
01:26:45,809 --> 01:26:49,479
Oh my god. The garden.

904
01:26:49,479 --> 01:26:53,608
Remember the time Alex
locked himself in the bathroom?

905
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:56,486
We knocked and knocked. Not a sound.

906
01:26:56,486 --> 01:26:57,946
I climbed out of a hole
and watched all the excitement from the tree.

907
01:26:57,946 --> 01:27:00,657
I climbed out of a hole
and watched all the excitement from the tree.

908
01:27:00,699 --> 01:27:04,661
And I laughed so hard,
I wet myself.

909
01:27:11,334 --> 01:27:15,964
What's happened in the 8 months
I overslept?

910
01:27:16,005 --> 01:27:18,591
Is she asleep? - Yeah.

911
01:27:22,345 --> 01:27:26,307
You've become adults,
that must be it.

912
01:27:27,058 --> 01:27:28,768
You look more and more like your father.

913
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:30,103
You look more and more like your father.

914
01:27:38,236 --> 01:27:39,695
Mum...

915
01:27:39,904 --> 01:27:43,824
I've lied to you all this time.
It's all different from what you think.

916
01:27:43,866 --> 01:27:46,869
Mum, what are you talking about?
- Your father...

917
01:27:51,874 --> 01:27:55,878
Your father didn't stay in the West
because of another woman.

918
01:27:56,545 --> 01:28:00,549
I lied.
And I also lied about...

919
01:28:04,553 --> 01:28:07,431
not hearing anything from him again.

920
01:28:08,015 --> 01:28:10,976
He wrote letters to me... and to you.

921
01:28:12,144 --> 01:28:15,773
They're all... in the kitchen cupboard.

922
01:28:22,654 --> 01:28:27,242
They made things so hard for him.
Just because he wasn't in the party.

923
01:28:27,284 --> 01:28:31,872
It was dreadful.
He didn't let anyone notice.

924
01:28:33,165 --> 01:28:36,043
But I knew.

925
01:28:36,168 --> 01:28:40,172
I... knew
and I couldn't help him.

926
01:28:42,966 --> 01:28:47,554
And then... there suddenly was
this congress in West Berlin.

927
01:28:49,097 --> 01:28:52,684
We only had 2 days to think.

928
01:28:54,019 --> 01:28:57,856
Your father wanted to stay in
the West and I...

929
01:28:57,897 --> 01:29:00,859
I was supposed to follow with you.

930
01:29:05,155 --> 01:29:08,158
Well, I couldn't do it.

931
01:29:11,286 --> 01:29:14,289
I... I was very frightened.

932
01:29:16,165 --> 01:29:20,128
You don't know, how it is.
Filling in an exit permit...

933
01:29:20,169 --> 01:29:24,507
with 2 children. You can't get out immediately.
You have to wait - endlessly!

934
01:29:24,549 --> 01:29:27,552
Sometimes even years. And you...

935
01:29:28,594 --> 01:29:32,598
They could have taken you away from me.
Do you understand?

936
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:41,857
Yes.

937
01:29:42,984 --> 01:29:45,945
I didn't go.

938
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:51,700
It was the worst mistake of my life.

939
01:29:51,742 --> 01:29:54,370
I know that now.

940
01:29:55,663 --> 01:29:59,250
I lied to you. Please forgive me!

941
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:23,357
My dear Robert...

942
01:30:25,234 --> 01:30:28,236
I thought about you so often...

943
01:30:30,155 --> 01:30:33,742
I would so much like to
see you once more.

944
01:31:11,863 --> 01:31:15,867
The same evening
mother's condition suddenly worsened.

945
01:32:22,474 --> 01:32:26,520
Your mother had another heart attack,
just as I feared.

946
01:32:26,561 --> 01:32:30,565
At the moment, she's relatively stable.
But I'm afraid...

947
01:32:32,275 --> 01:32:36,279
we have to expect the worst.
I'm sorry.

948
01:32:43,578 --> 01:32:47,499
The doctors can be wrong.
- Alex, don't lie to yourself.

949
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:51,419
Here, I found it.
He lives in Wannlake.

950
01:32:54,172 --> 01:33:00,094
I know, it's her last wish.
But I couldn't bring myself to go there.

951
01:33:03,681 --> 01:33:06,559
Mum's not going to die.

952
01:33:09,979 --> 01:33:11,814
Bye.

953
01:33:49,310 --> 01:33:52,896
Now you can accommodate someone after all.

954
01:33:55,733 --> 01:33:58,318
Accommodate? Who?

955
01:33:58,569 --> 01:34:01,447
Someone from the West.

956
01:34:24,219 --> 01:34:26,847
You have to sleep.

957
01:34:29,558 --> 01:34:33,436
If you want you you can sleep
lie down in the nurses' room.

958
01:35:11,057 --> 01:35:14,018
There he was. The idol of my youth.

959
01:35:14,477 --> 01:35:16,646
Like a conjured spirit
from my childhood: Sigmund Jhn.

960
01:35:16,646 --> 01:35:18,898
Like a conjured spirit
of my childhood Sigmund Jhn.

961
01:35:18,898 --> 01:35:24,153
He didn't give autographs, he didn't
talk to Pioneers about the secrets of the universe,

962
01:35:24,153 --> 01:35:27,990
the freedom you have in zero gravity
or the eternity of the cosmos.

963
01:35:28,157 --> 01:35:33,120
He drove a small, stinking Lada-Taxi.
- Where do you want to go?

964
01:35:33,162 --> 01:35:36,123
To Wannlake.
- I know what you're thinking.

965
01:35:36,165 --> 01:35:40,044
That's what many people think.
But that's not who I am.

966
01:35:40,169 --> 01:35:44,131
We were flying through the night.
Just like through the depths of the cosmos.

967
01:35:44,173 --> 01:35:48,135
Light-years away from the solar system,
past strange galaxies...

968
01:35:48,177 --> 01:35:52,139
with unknown lifeforms,
we landed in Wannlake.

969
01:35:52,431 --> 01:35:55,434
Could you wait a moment?

970
01:35:58,812 --> 01:36:01,398
I won't be long.

971
01:36:11,283 --> 01:36:14,161
Good evening.
- Hello. Come in.

972
01:36:17,539 --> 01:36:21,168
Is Mr. Kerner there?
- The buffet is outside. - Over there.

973
01:36:26,882 --> 01:36:29,467
Hello.

974
01:36:38,351 --> 01:36:39,936
Good evening.

975
01:36:46,151 --> 01:36:47,944
Hello! Good evening!

976
01:36:51,531 --> 01:36:53,324
Hello!

977
01:36:59,163 --> 01:37:04,919
Sandman, dear Sandman,
it isn't time yet...

978
01:37:04,961 --> 01:37:09,173
We send the evening greetings...

979
01:37:09,549 --> 01:37:12,885
before all the children have to go to bed.

980
01:37:12,969 --> 01:37:13,844
You surely have time left.

981
01:37:13,844 --> 01:37:16,013
You surely have time left.

982
01:37:18,891 --> 01:37:22,228
Hello.
- Hello. - Hello.

983
01:37:22,228 --> 01:37:25,606
May I watch the Sandman with you?
- Only if you tell us your name.

984
01:37:25,606 --> 01:37:26,107
May I watch the Sandman with you?
- Only if you tell us your name.

985
01:37:26,148 --> 01:37:28,734
Alexander.

986
01:37:34,156 --> 01:37:38,035
Look,
today the sandman is an astronaut.

987
01:37:38,535 --> 01:37:41,497
Where I come from it's called cosmonaut.

988
01:37:41,538 --> 01:37:45,417
Where do you come from?
- From a different country.

989
01:37:48,170 --> 01:37:51,131
Hi, you little bears.
- Hello, Dad.

990
01:37:51,173 --> 01:37:54,051
Hello. How are you?

991
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:56,803
Fine.

992
01:37:59,223 --> 01:38:02,226
So, are you also a fan of the Sandman?

993
01:38:02,309 --> 01:38:04,895
Yes, I am.

994
01:38:08,565 --> 01:38:12,569
Excuse me, do we know each other?
- Yes, we do.

995
01:38:13,862 --> 01:38:17,491
Yes. I can't think of it.
Please help me.

996
01:38:17,866 --> 01:38:20,452
His name's Alexander.

997
01:38:27,751 --> 01:38:29,336
Alex?

998
01:38:32,630 --> 01:38:37,594
Robert. Robert!
We're all waiting for you out here.

999
01:38:37,635 --> 01:38:40,096
Robert, come out!

1000
01:38:40,138 --> 01:38:44,601
Robert, we all know that you like to hide
in the bathroom on these occasions.

1001
01:38:50,565 --> 01:38:54,777
Dad, you have to give your speech.
- Robert, come out here.

1002
01:38:54,819 --> 01:38:57,697
I'll be back.

1003
01:39:02,618 --> 01:39:06,622
Oh, I see him.
You've kept us waiting.

1004
01:39:07,874 --> 01:39:10,751
Onto the stage!

1005
01:39:15,506 --> 01:39:19,844
Well, I thank you
all for coming here.

1006
01:39:19,844 --> 01:39:22,221
Thank you and...

1007
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:25,599
enjoy the evening. Thanks.

1008
01:39:25,599 --> 01:39:27,268
enjoy the evening. Thanks.

1009
01:39:37,152 --> 01:39:41,115
I'm sorry for having this
party here tonight.

1010
01:39:41,156 --> 01:39:44,743
Had I known you'd come, I...

1011
01:39:48,163 --> 01:39:52,125
Strange, I've always thought you've got
a swimming pool.

1012
01:39:52,167 --> 01:39:57,839
We've got a lake nearby.
My god, I didn't even recognize you.

1013
01:40:04,137 --> 01:40:07,766
Now I got 2 new brothers and sisters, hm?

1014
01:40:16,149 --> 01:40:21,321
For 3 years, every day I waited
for a message from you.

1015
01:40:21,363 --> 01:40:23,156
Every day.

1016
01:40:24,574 --> 01:40:28,161
It was my most fervent wish.

1017
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:41,758
Why have you come?

1018
01:40:47,138 --> 01:40:50,016
Mum's dying.

1019
01:40:51,225 --> 01:40:54,103
She had a heart attack.

1020
01:40:54,854 --> 01:40:57,732
She wants to see you once more.

1021
01:41:13,748 --> 01:41:16,751
What was it like up there?
- Up there?

1022
01:41:20,963 --> 01:41:23,549
Oh... up there.

1023
01:41:26,302 --> 01:41:29,179
It was wonderful up there.

1024
01:41:29,805 --> 01:41:32,766
Just very far away from home.

1025
01:41:39,148 --> 01:41:43,152
The Wall is no more.
There's no frontier!

1026
01:41:43,986 --> 01:41:46,488
It's not that bad.
It's all just one country now!

1027
01:41:47,281 --> 01:41:51,285
I don't understand a word. It's all untrue.
- That's why you have to play along.

1028
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:55,122
And why did I come back to the GDR?

1029
01:41:55,163 --> 01:41:58,750
I don't know. Just think of something!

1030
01:42:02,295 --> 01:42:05,298
No, it's absurd. I can't do that.

1031
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:09,928
You just have to overcome it,
then it'll be easy.

1032
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:36,746
Mum.
- Yes.

1033
01:42:37,163 --> 01:42:38,957
Ouch.

1034
01:43:04,398 --> 01:43:06,984
I want to get up.

1035
01:43:07,485 --> 01:43:10,071
How do I look?

1036
01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:21,916
You can go in now.

1037
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:28,047
And please remember, not a word!
- Yes, yes.

1038
01:43:37,973 --> 01:43:43,186
What did you talk about?
- Is that important?

1039
01:43:57,951 --> 01:44:01,955
How long has he been in there?
- More than an hour.

1040
01:44:06,167 --> 01:44:09,129
I hope he doesn't let the cat out of the bag.

1041
01:44:12,132 --> 01:44:17,846
The summer was over. I decided to end
the whole sham.

1042
01:44:18,138 --> 01:44:22,892
But once more we were about
to celebrate the anniversary of our socialist Fatherland.

1043
01:44:22,934 --> 01:44:27,480
But in contrast to reality...
as a dignified farewell.

1044
01:44:40,535 --> 01:44:42,120
Pst!

1045
01:44:50,878 --> 01:44:53,881
Yes? Camera running. Start at 3.

1046
01:44:59,887 --> 01:45:04,809
Dear citizens of the
German Democratic Republic.

1047
01:45:04,850 --> 01:45:08,813
If you've lived to see the wonder
of watching our blue planet...

1048
01:45:08,854 --> 01:45:11,398
from the depths of the cosmos...

1049
01:45:22,701 --> 01:45:26,955
As mum hardly couldn't wait,
we simply moved the GDR's anniversary...

1050
01:45:26,997 --> 01:45:32,169
from October 7 to October 2, 1990:
The eve of the reunification.

1051
01:45:52,939 --> 01:45:54,524
And?

1052
01:45:54,941 --> 01:45:57,944
Here. My best film yet, buddy.

1053
01:45:58,153 --> 01:46:02,115
Too bad no one but your mother
will ever see it.

1054
01:46:02,157 --> 01:46:06,119
Thank you, Denis. Without you, it would never...
- Yeah, it's alright. Here you go.

1055
01:46:06,161 --> 01:46:09,122
Zoom off, before it gets sentimental.

1056
01:46:09,956 --> 01:46:12,083
And tell me how it was!

1057
01:46:12,167 --> 01:46:17,172
On the occasion of today's annual anniversary of the GDR,
Erich Honecker resigned...

1058
01:46:17,213 --> 01:46:20,091
from all his functions.

1059
01:46:20,258 --> 01:46:21,843
What?

1060
01:46:21,968 --> 01:46:26,097
We ensure our friends in the world
that the socialism...

1061
01:46:26,139 --> 01:46:30,101
(Reporter) In his speech on the ceremony for
the GDR's anniversary...

1062
01:46:30,143 --> 01:46:34,105
in the Republic's palace, Erich Honecker
justified his decision by saying that

1063
01:46:34,147 --> 01:46:38,109
the changes achieved in the GDR in the past few months...

1064
01:46:38,151 --> 01:46:42,113
completed his political life's work.
Erich Honecker congratulated...

1065
01:46:42,155 --> 01:46:47,076
the new SED's CC General Secretary and
Chairman of the GDR's council of state:

1066
01:46:47,159 --> 01:46:50,037
Sigmund Jhn.
- What, Jhn?

1067
01:46:50,162 --> 01:46:55,334
In 1978, Sigmund Jhn was the first German
cosmonaut in space.

1068
01:46:55,960 --> 01:47:01,132
The new head of state addressed the
GDR's population in the evening.

1069
01:47:02,967 --> 01:47:08,889
Dear citizens of the
German Democratic Republic.

1070
01:47:09,139 --> 01:47:13,102
If you've lived to see the wonder
of watching our blue planet...

1071
01:47:13,143 --> 01:47:18,357
from the depths of the cosmos,
you see things differently.

1072
01:47:19,566 --> 01:47:21,819
Up there, in the depths of space,
the people's lives...

1073
01:47:21,819 --> 01:47:23,654
Up there, in the depths of space,
the people's lives...

1074
01:47:23,654 --> 01:47:28,951
seem small and insignificant. You ask yourself
what humanity has accomplished.

1075
01:47:28,951 --> 01:47:33,247
Which objectives did we set,
which objectives did we realize?

1076
01:47:33,455 --> 01:47:36,416
Today is our country's anniversary.

1077
01:47:36,458 --> 01:47:40,087
It's a very little country,
seen from the cosmos.

1078
01:47:40,128 --> 01:47:44,091
But still thousands of people
came to us last year.

1079
01:47:44,132 --> 01:47:49,221
People who we looked to as enemies and
who want to live here with us today.

1080
01:47:49,262 --> 01:47:54,100
We know our country is not perfect.
But what we believe in,

1081
01:47:54,142 --> 01:47:58,104
inspired a lot of people
in the whole world.

1082
01:47:58,146 --> 01:48:02,108
Maybe we have drifted off course
from time to time.

1083
01:48:02,150 --> 01:48:06,112
But we collected ourselves.
Socialism doesn't mean

1084
01:48:06,154 --> 01:48:10,575
living behind a wall. Socialism means
reaching out to others,

1085
01:48:10,617 --> 01:48:15,079
and living with others. Not just to dream
about a better world,

1086
01:48:15,163 --> 01:48:17,123
but to make the world a better place.

1087
01:48:17,123 --> 01:48:18,875
but making it a better world.

1088
01:48:18,875 --> 01:48:22,712
I have therefore decided
to open the GDR borders.

1089
01:48:24,130 --> 01:48:27,967
Shortly after the Fall of the Wall,
thousands of FRG citizens...

1090
01:48:28,217 --> 01:48:32,805
seized the opportunity
to visit the GDR for the first time.

1091
01:48:37,143 --> 01:48:41,105
Many want to stay. They're looking
for an alternative to...

1092
01:48:41,147 --> 01:48:46,110
the hard battle for survival in the capitalistic system.
- Isn't that wonderful?

1093
01:48:46,152 --> 01:48:50,114
Not everyone wants to join in with career addiction and
aggressive marketing.

1094
01:48:50,156 --> 01:48:54,160
Not everyone wants
to fight his way through life.

1095
01:48:58,164 --> 01:49:02,042
(Song) Such a day,
so wonderful like today...

1096
01:49:02,626 --> 01:49:06,755
These people want a different life.
They realize that cars,

1097
01:49:06,797 --> 01:49:11,593
video recorders and TVs are not everything.
They are ready to

1098
01:49:11,635 --> 01:49:17,307
realize a new life with nothing but
good will, vigour and hope.

1099
01:49:22,354 --> 01:49:24,147
Amazing.

1100
01:50:34,133 --> 01:50:37,720
My mother survived the GDR
by 3 days.

1101
01:50:38,137 --> 01:50:42,099
I guess it was the right thing,
that she never did learn the truth.

1102
01:50:42,141 --> 01:50:45,019
She died happily.

1103
01:50:46,562 --> 01:50:50,483
She wished for us to
scatter her ashes to the four winds.

1104
01:50:50,524 --> 01:50:56,238
That's not allowed in Germany.
Not in the West and not in the East. But we didn't care.

1105
01:51:29,938 --> 01:51:34,109
Up there she is floating and
maybe she is looking down at us.

1106
01:51:34,151 --> 01:51:38,113
And sees us as tiny
dots on our little Earth.

1107
01:51:38,155 --> 01:51:41,116
Just like Sigmund Jhn back then.

1108
01:51:43,159 --> 01:51:49,082
The country my mother left
was a country she had believed in

1109
01:51:49,457 --> 01:51:53,461
and which we kept alive
until her last second.

1110
01:51:54,295 --> 01:51:58,299
A country that in fact never existed like this.

1111
01:51:59,926 --> 01:52:05,890
A country that in my memory
will always be connected to my mother.
