1
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,040
Turn it off!

2
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,542
Turn it off!

3
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,758
OK, that's it for today!

4
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,847
This is a brothel,
not a chorus line!

5
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,600
You don't have to make the people think -

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,685
You have to make them fuck!

7
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,776
Now then -

8
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,487
The doctor says to the man:

9
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,615
You got two different testicles.

10
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:17,285
One is made of wood,
and the other one is metal.

11
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,331
The man is quite surprised,

12
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,793
and the doctor doesn't know what to say either.

13
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,879
But then he asks:
"Do you have children?"

14
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,842
The man says: "Yes, two -

15
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:36,054
Pinocchio is 3 and
Terminator will be 7 soon.

16
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,896
That's the joke?

17
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,482
Yes, damit!

18
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,527
Who is "Ponocchio"?

19
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:54,489
"Pinocchio" is a marionette
- made of wood.

20
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,617
And "Terminator" is made of metal.

21
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:02,080
- I don't understand your joke!
- Because you don't listen right!

22
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,166
- I did!
- No, you didn't!

23
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,502
I have to explain every joke to you
three times and you still don't get it!

24
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,588
I understood your fucking joke!

25
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,758
"Terminator" is a machine!

26
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,843
- made of metal!

27
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:20,015
But why is a child a marionette?

28
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,391
Now, that's it!

29
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,519
I'll never tell you a another
goddamned joke again!

30
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,693
You will drive this car to Curtis,
give it to him and piss off.

31
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,238
- OK, Boss!
- No, not OK!

32
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,240
"Driving" means: You don't stop even once!

33
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,743
But what if we have to take a piss?

34
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:43,789
Then one of you morons will take a piss
and the other one stays in the car!

35
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,958
You are never to take your eyes off the car!
Understood?

36
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,794
Understood, boss - understood!

37
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,838
Abdul, did you get that?

38
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,966
Yes, no problem, boss! - No problem!

39
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,305
OK, Hank, let's toss a coin:
If it's heads, I drive...

40
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,848
Abdul!

41
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,976
Hank will drive the car first!

42
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,230
You can switch later,
but Hank will start now!

43
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:13,110
Always Hank!

44
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,039
Hey! Maybe you can wait until I get in?

45
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,167
Be careful!
Idiots!

46
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,039
Good day!

47
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,167
I am here for the check-up.

48
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,968
- Am I allowed to smoke?
- No, it is strictly forbidden!

49
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,512
Damn...

50
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,975
Mr. Wurlitzer?

51
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,602
Rudi Wurlitzer?

52
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,687
Come with me!

53
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,816
- Please take off your clothes!
- Underwear too?

54
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,026
No!
That's enough!

55
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,320
Time for a urine sample!

56
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,988
Nurse?

57
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,074
I need a new cup -
this one is full!

58
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,867
- Sorry, I can't.

59
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:30,539
- Either you pee or I'll use a catheter!

60
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,820
Take a deep breath
And...

61
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,574
Hold it!

62
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:11,329
No!

63
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,584
I can't believe it!

64
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:20,380
Yes, I always say:
Preventive Check-up!

65
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,510
Where is it?
Here?

66
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,848
Cut it out!

67
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,393
We can do that

68
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:35,896
What do you mean:
"We can do that"?

69
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,983
That means that the tumour in your head
is already quite big.

70
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,528
It is still growing and it's pressing on
your brain. It doesn't look good.

71
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,282
You've come too late.

72
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,381
How much time do I have left?

73
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,591
Perhaps only days

74
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,972
My father died of bone cancer, too.

75
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,727
They dissected him piece by piece.

76
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,562
- but it didn't help

77
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,398
He died in the end.

78
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:23,068
How long ago was that, Mr. Wurlitzer?

79
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:24,820
20 years.

80
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,240
Medicine has made some progress
in the last 20 years.

81
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:33,370
Maybe technology is better now -

82
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,581
- but you still can't cure
cancer or HIV.

83
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:40,877
Yes, there will always be an
illness we can't cure.

84
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,631
I understand that you are worried.

85
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,717
Worried?

86
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,639
You know, it's just the fact that -

87
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:57,978
Death is a very unpleasant form of life.

88
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,277
Come on!
Come on!

89
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,873
Oh no!

90
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,625
You are not allowed to do
whatever you want Mr. Brest!

91
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,295
This is a hospital
and not an amusement park!

92
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:27,382
Mr. Wurlitzer, this is your bed.
You can put your things in the locker.

93
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,510
The doctor will stop by later.
You can rest now.

94
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:36,349
The doctor will find out about the cigarettes
and you'll be in deep trouble!

95
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:40,187
Nurse?

96
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,856
Can you give me a blowjob?

97
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,525
Or maybe bring me some tea?

98
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:17,516
Franky said we can switch,
and now I want to drive!

99
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,644
Goddamn it we're not even halfway there yet!

100
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:25,565
Move over, or shall I blow you?

101
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,151
God damn it!!

102
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,822
- Hank, why do I always have to flip?
- It's "flip out"...

103
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:57,264
This is automatic transmission.
You have to put it in "D"!

104
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,558
I know!

105
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:07,566
- Put it in "D"!
- I know!

106
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:12,154
And it is "blow one's brains"
and not just "blow someone"!

107
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,239
I know!

108
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,721
What is going on?

109
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,432
I just wanted to see if everything is alright.

110
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:41,892
"If everything is alright"?

111
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:48,148
You looked dead.
I don't want share a room with a dead man.

112
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,026
I am not dead.

113
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,236
I am still alive.

114
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,447
Good for you!

115
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:59,618
I've got a tumour in my head
as big as a tennis ball.

116
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,703
I only got a few days left.

117
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,794
They told you?

118
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,804
I've got cancer -

119
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:21,932
bone cancer.

120
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:29,856
This must be the bite-the-dust section.
Some kind of broom closet.

121
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,912
Maybe we should have asked?

122
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:50,168
Oh sure! "Nurse, we need salt and lemons,
because we want to get drunk with Tequila!"

123
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,353
Salt!

124
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:21,450
Well done, Abdul!
It was a red light!

125
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,492
I know!

126
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,537
If you scratched the paint, Franky will kill us!

127
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,665
You are completely nuts!

128
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,045
Where did you come from?

129
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:35,464
You assholes ran me over!

130
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,090
My leg!

131
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,259
Does it hurt?

132
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,386
Yeah, Achmed!

133
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,056
But nothing happened!

134
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:45,849
Are you a fucking doctor?

135
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:48,977
Come on boy, everything looks fine.

136
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,605
Do you want a banana?

137
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:59,529
I want you to take me to the hospital
with this car. Motherfuckers!

138
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:04,117
This car has only two seats.

139
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,245
Then ride in the trunk,
you can't drive anyway!

140
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:11,750
Smoking!

141
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,836
Smoking helps.

142
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,881
Smoking?

143
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,426
No, that's dangerous to your health!

144
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,806
Do I have lung cancer?

145
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:43,740
You stand on the beach and taste the salty
smell of the wind that comes from the ocean,

146
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:50,622
and inside you feel the warmth
of never ending freedom,

147
00:13:52,916 --> 00:14:03,218
and on your lips the bitter,
tear- soaked kiss of your lover.

148
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,557
I have never been to the ocean.

149
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,565
That can't be true!

150
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:19,901
You have never ever been to the ocean?

151
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,989
Never - ever!

152
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:29,828
Both of us are knocking on heavens door,
drinking tequila-

153
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:34,624
- we are biting-the-dust experts-

154
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,670
- and you have never - ever been to the ocean!

155
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:42,132
Never - ever!

156
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:46,595
Don't you know how it is
when you arrive in heaven?

157
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:54,770
In heaven that's all they talk about -
the ocean - and how wonderful it is.

158
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:05,489
They talk about the sunsets they have seen.
They talk about how the sun turned blood-red
before it set.

159
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:09,868
And they talk about how they felt
when the sun was loosing its power,

160
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:15,916
- and the cold that was coming from the ocean,
while the rest of the fire was still glowing.

161
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:20,504
And you -

162
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:26,051
You can't talk about it with them,
since you have never been there!

163
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:31,556
You will be a fucking outsider up there!

164
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:44,694
And there is nothing we can do about it?

165
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,207
How did this happen?

166
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:02,337
These two morons went through a red light
and hit me.

167
00:16:20,272 --> 00:16:24,526
Can you do me a favour please?
Don't let them go!

168
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:29,114
- There will be trouble with the insurance.
- Sure.

169
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:45,464
- We are in a hurry and the boy is fine, anyway.
- The doctor will decide that for himself.

170
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,760
Let's smash the window!

171
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,888
First you run over a kid and then you run away?

172
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,561
Don't let these idiots go!

173
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:07,402
- We've got a very important job to do!
- Everybody shut up! We're leaving now!

174
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:11,323
- What the hell is this?
- What did you say, bitch?

175
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:14,659
Hank says we are in a hurry and
Abdul says we go! Understand?

176
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:18,121
Are you stupid? Don't let these idiots go!

177
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,041
You gotta hit it!

178
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,752
On the ignition?

179
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,601
Tell me... how is your leg?

180
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,686
It's OK.

181
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,189
The pain is gone?

182
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,774
Yeah, the pain's gone!

183
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,611
Good!

184
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:51,696
Little motherfucker!

185
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:59,204
- Step back!
- Don't move, assholes!

186
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,971
Is the surgery over?

187
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:19,850
Yeah, you're in heaven.
I'm god and this is Petrus.

188
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,393
Salam Aleikum!

189
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:22,769
Oh shit!

190
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:30,485
Excuse us, can you tell us where the exit is?

191
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,613
Over there on the left.

192
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,367
Did you see that?
They've got the same car as us!

193
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:53,068
Where did you get the gun?

194
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:56,196
It was in the glove compartment.

195
00:19:57,155 --> 00:20:00,242
Glove compartment?

196
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,536
What car is this, anyway?

197
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:05,664
That is a Mercedes 230 SL baby-blue.

198
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:10,335
I mean who does it belong to?

199
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:13,088
I have no idea - we stole it!

200
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:18,593
You mean I was involved in the theft of a car?

201
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:21,221
You could say that.

202
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:24,683
- I can't remember anything!
- You helped pick it out.

203
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:28,103
- Martin Brest, right?
- Yes, the one from the hospital.

204
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:31,523
Shouldn't we get going?
We are on our way to the ocean.

205
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:35,193
You have never been there,
so we decided to go.

206
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,658
I think I don't want to go.

207
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,453
Then you can't talk about it up there!

208
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:47,622
Yes, I know, I also want to go to the ocean,
but...

209
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,168
... I am afraid.

210
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:55,505
Let me tell you:

211
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:59,176
You don't have to be afraid.

212
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:05,307
Didn't I tell you:
Nobody was to leave the fucking car?

213
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:11,146
Didn't I tell you idiots
not to take your eyes of the car?

214
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,816
Didn't I?

215
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,527
Yes, you did, boss!

216
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:20,655
Why didn't you do it, then?

217
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:23,867
There was this boy...

218
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:26,912
I don't want to hear any more bullshit!

219
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:30,040
I could kill both of you!

220
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,168
I mean, I have the right to do so!

221
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:37,756
But I want my car back and
therefore I'm giving you another chance.

222
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:42,344
Bring the car back and the
two motherfuckers that stole it!

223
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:45,472
And make it quick!

224
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:48,600
Do you understand?

225
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,798
Good morning!

226
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:28,098
85.70 please!

227
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,143
I know, but unfortunately I have no money
with me.

228
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:35,439
Oh, you are driving a big Mercedes,
but you don't have any money?

229
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:38,567
Then give me your pyjamas!

230
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:49,828
It seems we've got a problem here.

231
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,345
Should I be afraid or something?

232
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:10,223
Martin! Don't be stupid!

233
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:13,143
Finally there is someone with a good idea!

234
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:18,690
Put the gun away! I don't want to be
involved in this. It's armed robbery!

235
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:26,615
Oh no! Just forget what I said!

236
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:30,035
- Rudi, go back to the car!
- No, I won't!

237
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:33,205
At this moment it is just armed - something-,
since I didn't take anything!

238
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:34,456
But you plan to do it!

239
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:35,374
Boys!

240
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:38,502
- Just a second!
- We don't have money...

241
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:39,544
Boys!

242
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:42,672
- One moment! We shouldn't do it!
- Why not?

243
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:43,632
It's against the law!

244
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:44,716
BOYS!

245
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:45,801
WHAT?

246
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:51,848
Just a hint - before my fingers fall asleep -
maybe you should plan your robberies beforehand!

247
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:54,976
You're starting to get on my fucking nerves!
This gun is real!

248
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:59,147
I believe you, but what can you
really do to me anyway?

249
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:06,988
It is now 10:58am. At 11am, my friend will
come by and he is a policeman.

250
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:10,075
He always comes at 11am.

251
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:19,167
He walks in and checks if everything is alright,
drinks a "Jaegermeister" and then he leaves again.

252
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:22,295
IF everything is alright...

253
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:25,465
Where is Klaus?

254
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:27,384
Who is Klaus?

255
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:32,597
Every morning at 11am I come in here
and Klaus is there instead of you.

256
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:35,517
Oh, Klaus!

257
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:38,019
He's sick.

258
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:50,115
Perhaps you are telling the truth
and he really is ill-

259
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:55,871
- what car is this?

260
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:59,541
That is a Mercedes 230 SL baby-blue.

261
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:02,502
Baby-blue?

262
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:05,380
Who owns it?

263
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:11,303
You're a tough customer!

264
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:15,474
Hey, wait a sec!

265
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:19,853
Me and Rudi stole this car yesterday!

266
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,730
Who is Rudi?

267
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,607
Rudi Wurlitzer!

268
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:29,321
We want to go to the ocean and we didn't
have a car. What could we have done? Walk?

269
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:32,574
And Klaus is really not ill.

270
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:37,788
Well, maybe up there, since he wanted my pyjamas!

271
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:45,295
But now he is sitting down here
with a gun pointed at his head!

272
00:26:01,853 --> 00:26:04,064
That's a good one!

273
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:06,149
Really good!

274
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,863
My drink is on the house, like always!

275
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:14,700
No, it's 2.50!

276
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:20,956
Maybe you can get away with this with Klaus,
since he is your friend. But with me you gotta
to pay 2.50.

277
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:58,076
Good day, gentleman!

278
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:00,579
What can I do for you?

279
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,039
How much is this car?

280
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,958
That is a Mercedes 230 SL - 170 HP.

281
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:08,086
How much is it?

282
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:10,672
The way it is now?

283
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:16,428
Leather seats, special paint,
stereo radio - with CD player!

284
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:20,515
How much?

285
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:25,270
Since you are a foreigner
and foreigners have a hard time in Germany...

286
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,147
75,000!

287
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:31,860
Are you playing us for a sucker?
That is a used car!

288
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:36,531
I know, but it's a rare item
and rare items cost a lot.

289
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:40,827
But first we sign the papers.

290
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,084
Do you have money?

291
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:50,212
Not enough!

292
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,465
Lets bump this motherfucker!

293
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:55,008
Bump him OFF!

294
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,719
Bump him off and take the car!

295
00:27:57,719 --> 00:28:00,305
Can you hold the car until tonight?

296
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:03,475
Sure!

297
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:10,524
That looks great on you, Rudi!

298
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:13,235
Maybe you should try on the red one again?

299
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:15,987
I will, but I think I will take this one!

300
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:24,079
If you plan to rob this shop too, I'm
outta here! Got it?

301
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:26,164
Sure!

302
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:30,669
- Am I allowed to smoke here?
- Of course!

303
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:37,175
How much for all of this?

304
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:40,595
Your suit alone is 2,300.

305
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:43,598
2,300?

306
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:49,104
I'll have to pick up some cash first.

307
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:52,566
But this is... about...

308
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:57,029
3,000- for now

309
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:01,950
These are most amazing clothes I have ever worn.

310
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,329
Just a few Marks from the gas station -
they are a gas company, they won't even notice!

311
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:07,789
Right!

312
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,917
I'll go and get some money now, ok?

313
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:41,531
Sorry, we're on lunch break.

314
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:43,992
Lunch break is cancelled today!

315
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:12,104
You have to say something or
nothing will happen here!

316
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:15,357
You got 3 seconds:
Someone will tell me what I want or...

317
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:19,111
Let's just say that this is
not a water pistol!

318
00:30:21,113 --> 00:30:23,198
You want all the money!

319
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:28,912
100 Marks for you, the rest goes in the bag!
Hurry up!

320
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:32,457
Excuse me...

321
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,043
What?

322
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:41,717
I know it's a stupid question, but
usually my customers don't turn up in pyjamas...

323
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:49,474
Without shoes even!

324
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:56,648
Hi, my name is Martin Brest!
As you can see I am robbing your silly bank!

325
00:30:56,648 --> 00:31:00,902
And just because I picked out this suit,
but I can't afford it!

326
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:05,073
You can stop babbling:
They don't record the audio anyway.

327
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:08,744
80,000!

328
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:24,801
Hank! Look at that guy!

329
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:29,389
What about him?

330
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:32,517
Look at the amazing suit he is wearing!

331
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:36,688
Come on!

332
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:38,440
I'll take the black one!

333
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,068
That should be enough!
Come on, Rudi!

334
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:44,196
You can keep the rest!

335
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:47,866
I think we can lower our hands now...

336
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:49,701
Hands up!
This is a robbery!

337
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:52,871
What are you looking at assholes?
Gimme all your money or you're dead!

338
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:55,957
You've arrived too late, by one minute...

339
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:33,495
- This red thing looks completely silly!
- Stop bitching...

340
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:38,500
Red is your colour!

341
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:04,359
What's in the bag?

342
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,153
Just come on!

343
00:33:06,153 --> 00:33:09,781
Tell me what's in there,
or I'll stay right here.

344
00:33:50,155 --> 00:33:52,240
60... 70...

345
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,785
75!

346
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:57,329
75,000!

347
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:01,625
And I am wearing this ridiculous red thing!

348
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:05,170
We'll buy you a new one.

349
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:08,298
What? We'll buy you a new one!

350
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:10,384
Or two?

351
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:28,735
Trinidad! Tierra del Fuego! Bora-Bora! Hawaii!

352
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:34,157
Even some places we can't pronounce!

353
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:46,044
Actually, I only want to go to the ocean.

354
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:35,761
Do you really believe we will be sitting on
a cloud and talk about the ocean?

355
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:43,602
Yes, I really do!

356
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:04,331
Boss!

357
00:36:04,373 --> 00:36:06,625
This just came in from Wiesbaden!

358
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:08,960
Martin Brest is a Snow White!

359
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,796
Oh, you mean...

360
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:13,715
No, he is not in our files!

361
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:16,885
So why did he crack up then?
He's never done anything and now:

362
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:20,013
bank robbery, gas station...

363
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:23,225
And what about the car, this Mercedes...?

364
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:24,559
Nothing.

365
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:27,729
And now guess why!

366
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,820
Just put out a search warrant, Keller!

367
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:37,447
OK, boss!

368
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:39,825
And, Keller?

369
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:43,453
Nothing...

370
00:37:05,892 --> 00:37:09,020
One million!

371
00:37:09,938 --> 00:37:12,774
And you, like an idiot, are robbing banks!

372
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:15,861
One million! This is a lucky car!

373
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:22,117
And now?

374
00:38:07,913 --> 00:38:11,041
If you need something else,
just ring for me.

375
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,546
What?

376
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,965
Oh, yes.

377
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:26,473
Thank you. I hope you enjoy your stay!

378
00:38:29,684 --> 00:38:32,854
Thank you very much!

379
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:44,282
Hey! Where are you going?

380
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:46,368
I quit!

381
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:59,423
Is there something you can tell me?
Except that you turned this place upside down?

382
00:38:59,423 --> 00:39:02,551
Of course!
Look what I found!

383
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:06,096
This is for a check-up in the hospital.
In half an hour. We can make it there!

384
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:09,224
- That was yesterday!
- Oh, we might be late then.

385
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:18,400
Two number fifteens, please.
Is there anything else you can recommend?

386
00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:22,988
Oh yes - what is it?

387
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:26,116
I see. Two ice-creams then.

388
00:39:28,618 --> 00:39:31,747
And, one bottle of...

389
00:39:31,747 --> 00:39:36,960
No, two bottles of "Cuvee Dom Perignon" -
and two glasses please!

390
00:39:38,128 --> 00:39:39,171
Ten minutes?

391
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:41,006
Okay, thanks.

392
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:45,093
Oh, and a French dictionary please!

393
00:39:47,512 --> 00:39:50,098
Of course, boss!

394
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,684
Yes Franky...

395
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:55,854
The cops are after the car, too...

396
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:59,274
We are listening to the cops radio...

397
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:02,527
You can rely on us, Franky - 120 percent!

398
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:08,658
Yes, 120 percent...

399
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:12,621
Yes, today.

400
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:22,214
What did Franky say?

401
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:26,385
Franky says: "If you morons don't find the car
before the cops do -

402
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:28,970
- something bad will happen to you!"

403
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:31,598
But what can happen? Franky is harmless!

404
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:32,724
Are you kidding?

405
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:37,979
I heard Franky once bit someones balls off,
that owed him money.

406
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,066
And he swallowed them!

407
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:44,778
Ahhh! That was delicious!

408
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:47,864
Now tell me: What was it?

409
00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:51,201
Bull testicles!

410
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:55,789
- You are saying we ate the balls of a bull?
- Seems so...

411
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:05,382
Let's hope the ice cream was
really ice cream!

412
00:41:18,729 --> 00:41:21,648
- How many do you have?
- Eight.

413
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:24,151
- Eight?
- Yes, how many do you have?

414
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:27,070
Twenty

415
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:31,241
Do you remember that the doctor said that
you only have a few days left?

416
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:39,583
Maybe we should pick just one wish -
the most important one!

417
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:47,299
That's difficult... I don't want to decide.

418
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:53,555
Let's do it this way: You pick a number from
my list and I pick one from yours.

419
00:41:53,889 --> 00:41:56,975
- Okay. Who starts?
- You!

420
00:41:56,975 --> 00:42:00,145
You have twenty... then I take number...

421
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:04,733
One! I take number one!

422
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:08,945
That's the Cadillac for my mother.

423
00:42:08,945 --> 00:42:11,698
- "Cadillac for your mother"?
- Yes.

424
00:42:11,823 --> 00:42:15,994
A Cadillac Fleetwood -
like the one Elvis bought for his mother.

425
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:21,583
My mother is the biggest Elvis fan in the world.

426
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:28,090
When I was a small boy I was sitting in front of the TV
with my mother, when we saw it.

427
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:34,930
My mother was sitting there and she cried.

428
00:42:36,098 --> 00:42:41,311
And since then it was my biggest wish
to buy one for her, too.

429
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:45,565
But I never had the money...

430
00:42:46,108 --> 00:42:49,236
That is a good wish

431
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:53,824
I like it.

432
00:42:56,952 --> 00:43:00,080
Now it's your turn. Pick a number.

433
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:03,583
You had eight - so I take seven -

434
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:06,336
No, I'll take number one, too.

435
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:10,924
Can't we pick something else?

436
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:24,688
That's your wish?

437
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:26,982
Your number one wish?

438
00:43:26,982 --> 00:43:30,110
Yes, it's not as good as the
Cadillac for your mother, but...

439
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:32,487
"Fuck two women at once".

440
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:34,281
No: "Sleep with them"!

441
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:37,409
"Fuck"! - You want to "fuck" them.

442
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:42,497
- That's how you say it in your language!
- That's how you say it in every language!

443
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:47,502
"To sleep": That is to close your eyes
and turn around.

444
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:50,672
The thing you want to do is: "Fuck"!

445
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:08,959
Martin! Wake up!

446
00:45:10,836 --> 00:45:13,088
What's wrong?

447
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:15,340
The police!

448
00:45:28,228 --> 00:45:32,441
Put your guns away, or
I will kill the hostage!

449
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:46,788
Take off your clothes!

450
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,090
Did you catch the bandits?

451
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,009
Do I look like Batman?

452
00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:00,677
- Are you the manager?
- Yes.

453
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:05,891
They want to blow up the entire hotel.
We'll call the SWAT team!

454
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:19,988
Nice car, isn't it?

455
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:22,574
This is our car!

456
00:46:22,574 --> 00:46:27,245
- Your car?
- Yes, officer, it was stolen.

457
00:46:27,371 --> 00:46:29,539
- Too bad.
- Yes, bad things happen...

458
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:34,753
Things happen? The two motherfucking
thieves are probably in that hotel!

459
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:36,129
Probably!

460
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:38,423
Is this your car?

461
00:46:38,423 --> 00:46:43,095
Here is the key!
Never leave it on the sun visor again!

462
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:47,516
See?

463
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:56,358
I am coming soon, lads!

464
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:04,199
That were nice fucking cops!

465
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,537
I knew that I could rely on you!

466
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,209
Well done!

467
00:47:24,803 --> 00:47:27,973
Where is the case?

468
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:29,808
Which case?

469
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:32,978
The case with my money is gone!

470
00:47:33,395 --> 00:47:35,439
We don't know anything about a case.

471
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:44,823
There was a case with a million that I owe to
Curtis and now you motherfuckers owe it to me!

472
00:47:45,991 --> 00:47:48,702
But where can we get a million?

473
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:52,330
Why are you asking me? Go to the bank!
Play the lottery! Ask your mothers!

474
00:47:52,372 --> 00:47:56,501
But the fucking cops stole it.
They are all corrupt!

475
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:01,298
Corrupt!

476
00:48:01,339 --> 00:48:04,426
- See?
- I know!

477
00:48:22,778 --> 00:48:26,948
- Is something wrong?
- Your driver's license and registration, please!

478
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:32,788
registration...

479
00:48:33,205 --> 00:48:35,290
driver's license.

480
00:48:36,249 --> 00:48:39,294
- The car is almost new?
- Not even one year old.

481
00:48:39,294 --> 00:48:41,880
- How many kilometres?
- Less than 30,000.

482
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,466
- Have you been in the army?
- 4 years.

483
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:46,093
- Yes or No?

484
00:48:46,093 --> 00:48:47,719
Yes, sir!

485
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:49,304
Are there problems with the radiator?

486
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:51,640
- Who?
- The car!

487
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,975
No. Everything's fine.

488
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:58,647
I think everything is fine here, too.
He is destined for the mission!

489
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:00,732
What mission?

490
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:03,902
Get out of the car!

491
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,325
Come with me.

492
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:17,332
This is a special mission. We picked you
because we think you are destined to do it.

493
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:21,420
Really?
Can I get some money out of it?

494
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:24,089
We are doing it for the government.

495
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:25,257
Yes, sir!

496
00:49:25,257 --> 00:49:27,008
Mr. Schneider! Hello, Mr. Schneider!

497
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:29,094
Inspector Schneider!

498
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:37,769
Well, Mr. Inspector Schneider, I just wanted to
tell you that Brest now stole a police car!

499
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:40,772
Couldn't you wait until I am back in the office?

500
00:49:40,814 --> 00:49:43,942
And there is something else!

501
00:49:45,068 --> 00:49:46,737
What is it? Should I guess?

502
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:48,905
- You'll never guess!
- Keller!

503
00:49:48,947 --> 00:49:52,034
- The other one - Wurlitzer - he is a hostage!
- Hostage!?

504
00:49:52,075 --> 00:49:55,203
Yes, he threatened him with a gun!
He wanted to kill him!

505
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:58,832
How did you get to the police, by the way?

506
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:00,876
I used the bus!

507
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:02,878
Authorization...

508
00:50:02,919 --> 00:50:04,963
Document...

509
00:50:21,563 --> 00:50:25,317
Allowing for all possibilities,
they couldn't have gotten further than this!

510
00:50:25,317 --> 00:50:27,194
Well done, Keller!

511
00:50:27,194 --> 00:50:28,862
Do you want to earn some points?

512
00:50:28,862 --> 00:50:31,615
- Sure, boss!
- Initiate a police search there!

513
00:50:31,615 --> 00:50:34,409
Keller, you will get us a hubi.
We'll fly there!

514
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:35,994
Heli!

515
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:37,621
Sorry?

516
00:50:37,621 --> 00:50:39,998
The official abbreviation for
"helicopter" is "heli"!

517
00:50:39,998 --> 00:50:43,168
I don't fucking care what it is called
as long as it flies!

518
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:09,319
Put your hands behind your head and
step back from the car!

519
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:10,570
What?

520
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:13,073
Your hands! Behind your head!
I am a police officer!

521
00:51:13,073 --> 00:51:15,242
Me too!

522
00:51:15,283 --> 00:51:17,452
Come here - I need your help!

523
00:51:17,452 --> 00:51:19,204
I have a small problem with
the radiator...

524
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:22,374
I filled it with water, but the engine is overheated!

525
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,714
I havent got a clue about cars!
Can I see your police ID, please?

526
00:51:28,714 --> 00:51:32,884
Listen to me: I am a special representative
of the Department of the Interior.

527
00:51:32,884 --> 00:51:36,012
I am delivering a document
to the chancellors office!

528
00:51:36,012 --> 00:51:40,183
It would be best for everyone, if you
would let me use your helicopter, now!

529
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,729
Can I see the authorization?

530
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:54,781
I thought that police cars never break down...

531
00:51:57,284 --> 00:52:00,203
...never go bust...

532
00:52:00,203 --> 00:52:02,497
Everything alright, colleague?

533
00:52:02,497 --> 00:52:05,625
Everything alright!
You can join us in the helicopter!

534
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:14,176
There will be consequences!

535
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:41,495
Rudi!

536
00:53:27,666 --> 00:53:29,584
Do you have this!?

537
00:53:29,584 --> 00:53:31,420
Excuse me, please!

538
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:34,256
You will need a prescription.

539
00:53:34,256 --> 00:53:37,884
Don't be ridiculous!
It's a matter of life and death!

540
00:53:37,926 --> 00:53:42,097
- I'll pay as much as you want!
- I can't, it's a very strong drug!

541
00:54:43,492 --> 00:54:46,620
Load your weapons!
Take your stand!

542
00:54:47,454 --> 00:54:49,539
Off you go!

543
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:54,961
Boss, you have to see this!

544
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:58,298
"...we don't know if people
were injured or killed..."

545
00:54:58,298 --> 00:55:01,426
"...we will now switch to our reporter,
she is on the scene..."

546
00:55:01,426 --> 00:55:03,095
Do you want to marry me, Keller?

547
00:55:03,095 --> 00:55:06,223
"I am knockin' on heavens door!
I've got nothing to loose!"

548
00:55:06,223 --> 00:55:07,349
This guy is sick!

549
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:10,519
"Fuck off!"

550
00:55:12,771 --> 00:55:15,941
"Hey, I want you to fuck off!
You got two minutes!"

551
00:55:16,525 --> 00:55:18,735
"That was about 10 minutes ago."

552
00:55:18,735 --> 00:55:24,991
"The police withdrew and the kidnapper
Martin Brest fled into this Turkish diner."

553
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:26,743
Why do I learn this from TV?

554
00:55:26,785 --> 00:55:34,042
"The psychopathic Martin Brest kidnapped
Rudi Wurlitzer on Monday night from a hospital."

555
00:55:34,584 --> 00:55:36,670
She doesn't have any tits!

556
00:55:45,846 --> 00:55:48,432
Snipers!

557
00:55:48,473 --> 00:55:51,059
They probably got snipers on the roof!

558
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:54,187
If they had snipers,
you wouldn't be standing there!

559
00:55:56,898 --> 00:56:00,027
But I am the hostage!

560
00:56:00,652 --> 00:56:03,780
They wouldn't kill the hostage - would they?

561
00:56:04,197 --> 00:56:07,325
That's happened before.

562
00:56:26,178 --> 00:56:29,347
[Turkish]

563
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:38,940
The "Helsinki Syndrome" describes a change
in the relationship between the hostage and
the kidnapper.

564
00:56:39,524 --> 00:56:44,780
A radical, unconscious change
of the hostage's survival strategy.

565
00:56:45,364 --> 00:56:53,538
After some time in panic, the hostage starts to
seek the trust and friendship of the kidnapper.

566
00:56:53,538 --> 00:56:57,709
But he is still violently following his goals.

567
00:56:57,876 --> 00:57:01,838
What goal?
That's bullshit!

568
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,051
Mr Schneider, please let me do the
psychological study!

569
00:57:06,218 --> 00:57:12,474
You can study whatever you want, but these
two guys are playing us for a sucker!

570
00:57:14,893 --> 00:57:18,021
It's OK, you don't have to pay!

571
00:57:25,404 --> 00:57:29,574
Listen, I can't give you change for that...
This is not a bank.

572
00:57:30,117 --> 00:57:32,202
That's alright

573
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:42,421
They are coming out!

574
00:57:50,762 --> 00:57:53,348
I am sorry, but I need your car!

575
00:57:53,348 --> 00:57:56,518
- Get into the car, baby face!
- Don't ever call me baby face again!

576
00:57:56,518 --> 00:57:59,604
In the other side!

577
00:58:00,439 --> 00:58:03,608
Get closer!

578
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:08,488
We're on air!

579
00:58:08,905 --> 00:58:13,160
"When leaving the diner, Brest threatened
a woman and took her car."

580
00:58:13,201 --> 00:58:19,458
"Brest, who seems to be ready for anything,
robbed a bank the other day for 80,000 Marks."

581
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:22,961
Not to mention my million!

582
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:27,966
"We do not know what he did to Wurlitzer,
but we hope that the hostage is ok."

583
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:34,222
"We will be back as soon as there are more news.
Celia Sarto for TVL2."

584
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:39,227
Corrupt cops, yes...

585
00:58:40,062 --> 00:58:41,146
SHIT!

586
00:58:42,564 --> 00:58:45,734
The guy had my suitcase!

587
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:50,739
Get Carlos and the Rodriguez brothers and...

588
00:58:50,739 --> 00:58:53,825
GET MY MONEY BACK!

589
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:24,106
Boss, they stole a car and
are heading for the Dutch border now.

590
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:28,777
Tell our people to follow and observe them,
but without attracting attention!

591
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:39,830
Are they stupid?
Aren't they afraid that you could kill me?

592
00:59:56,388 --> 00:59:59,558
You just lost your driver's license!

593
01:02:13,191 --> 01:02:16,778
If I knew this would happen,
I would have gone to school for another job!

594
01:02:16,778 --> 01:02:19,865
You went to SCHOOL for this shit???

595
01:02:24,036 --> 01:02:26,246
We lost them!

596
01:02:26,246 --> 01:02:29,374
We really lost them!

597
01:03:09,331 --> 01:03:12,417
They're gone!
These idiots are lucky, too!

598
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:15,545
Too much luck for my taste!
You will now take over from here!

599
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:19,758
You are now responsible here, Keller!
Now you have to show me that you are a cop!

600
01:03:22,552 --> 01:03:25,681
Yes, boss!
I'll get them!

601
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:29,017
I'll get you motherfuckers!

602
01:03:30,894 --> 01:03:34,022
Boss! Boss!

603
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:50,080
Hello!

604
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:54,126
What are you doing! Get out of my car!
If there is a problem come to my window!

605
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:58,296
That's not possible,
since everybody could see my gun then!

606
01:03:59,047 --> 01:04:01,007
Don't make a mistake!

607
01:04:01,049 --> 01:04:04,136
You can put your hands down.

608
01:04:05,512 --> 01:04:07,055
Do you know me?

609
01:04:07,097 --> 01:04:09,141
No.

610
01:04:11,643 --> 01:04:13,729
Open this!

611
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:31,371
I am married, we don't have children yet,
but my wife is pregnant...

612
01:04:31,371 --> 01:04:34,499
Hey, that's good for you!
Congratulations!

613
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:40,005
Now listen to me: This is 80,000 Marks,
which I robbed from the bank.

614
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:46,595
And this is about 3,000 Marks,
which I robbed from the gas station.

615
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:50,265
I want you to give the money back!
Can I count on you?

616
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:53,268
- Yes, of course.
- Good.

617
01:04:53,268 --> 01:04:56,396
That should clarify the situation
with your people.

618
01:04:56,521 --> 01:04:59,066
If I see a cop from now on -

619
01:04:59,066 --> 01:05:01,610
I will kill the hostage!

620
01:05:08,367 --> 01:05:09,743
Everything fine?

621
01:05:09,743 --> 01:05:12,871
- Yes, we are debt-free!
- That sounds good to me!

622
01:05:28,929 --> 01:05:32,057
Off you go, TJ!

623
01:05:32,265 --> 01:05:35,394
If you need a taxi again: 2727!

624
01:05:39,981 --> 01:05:43,110
Good day, gentlemen!
What can I do for you?

625
01:05:44,236 --> 01:05:47,280
Have we met before?

626
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,574
No.

627
01:05:49,574 --> 01:05:52,703
We want to buy a Cadillac!

628
01:05:53,328 --> 01:05:57,499
Just like the one that Elvis bought
for his mother.

629
01:06:00,502 --> 01:06:02,587
No problem!

"HOSTAGE-DRAMA:

- What's the street?

632
01:06:49,634 --> 01:06:55,891
- I told you: Huehnerbeinstrasse!
- Ha, that's a strange name for a street...

OK, put the letters in the mail now.

A Cadillac for you, two women for me...

01:08:21,309 --> 01:08:23,395
My boy!

639
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:32,988
What happened to you?

640
01:08:49,129 --> 01:08:52,257
Where have you been for so long?

641
01:08:53,717 --> 01:08:56,845
Look at what I brought for you!

642
01:09:11,526 --> 01:09:14,696
It's beautiful!

643
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,370
I don't even have a driver's license!

644
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:28,627
And you're not even Elvis...

645
01:09:39,805 --> 01:09:42,307
Come on Brest! The game is over!
Drop the gun!

646
01:09:42,307 --> 01:09:45,102
Get inside mom!

647
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:48,230
- What is going on?
- Drop the gun, Brest!

648
01:09:50,315 --> 01:09:53,485
Or I'll shoot!

649
01:09:53,568 --> 01:09:56,279
- Martin, do what he says!
- I can't do that, Rudi!

650
01:09:56,279 --> 01:09:58,365
Drop the gun!

651
01:09:58,365 --> 01:10:01,284
The ocean is not so important now!
I will see it eventually!

652
01:10:01,284 --> 01:10:04,413
Yes, you will see it! But what about me!?

653
01:10:22,431 --> 01:10:25,600
Well done, Brest!

654
01:10:28,687 --> 01:10:30,772
Let me go!

655
01:10:35,777 --> 01:10:40,365
You are a liar! You tell me about the ocean,
but you have never been there yourself!

656
01:10:40,407 --> 01:10:45,620
- Arrest the son-of-a-bitch!
- What? This man is dying! He is seriously ill!

657
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:50,792
Get an ambulance, or you
will have to arrest him in heaven!

658
01:11:01,136 --> 01:11:03,221
I will go with him.

659
01:11:03,221 --> 01:11:07,184
What? You are going with him?
After all he has done to you?

660
01:11:07,184 --> 01:11:13,440
I know the doctor! I know the hospital!
He is my friend and I will take care for him!

661
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:20,947
Helsinki Syndrome!

662
01:11:20,947 --> 01:11:24,076
You go with them!

663
01:13:39,544 --> 01:13:44,216
- Is that a brothel or a chorus line?
- Nobody else knows either...

664
01:13:44,216 --> 01:13:45,967
It's a brothel!

665
01:13:47,052 --> 01:13:47,969
What?

666
01:13:47,969 --> 01:13:50,055
A brothel!

667
01:14:17,999 --> 01:14:19,960
What about you?

668
01:14:20,001 --> 01:14:23,130
Hey, it's your wish, Rudi!

669
01:14:36,018 --> 01:14:38,020
Can I have two...?

670
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:41,273
You can have them all -
when you got enough money!

671
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:06,923
Are you done already?
Then take care of the toilettes now!

672
01:15:07,299 --> 01:15:10,761
No, I don't think we will
clean the toilettes today, boss!

673
01:15:10,761 --> 01:15:12,512
You don't think so?

674
01:15:12,554 --> 01:15:15,640
And why don't you think so, Abdul?

675
01:15:17,017 --> 01:15:20,145
They are here!

676
01:15:31,948 --> 01:15:35,077
Didn't you like it, Rudi?

677
01:15:35,369 --> 01:15:38,497
Oh, I did...

678
01:15:38,997 --> 01:15:42,167
But you look so sad.

679
01:15:44,836 --> 01:15:48,632
There are so many undone things in my life,

680
01:15:48,632 --> 01:15:51,760
so many things unsaid...

681
01:15:52,803 --> 01:15:55,931
You know...

682
01:15:57,474 --> 01:16:00,602
That was probably the greatest fuck of my life!

683
01:16:05,899 --> 01:16:07,984
And your last!

684
01:16:19,037 --> 01:16:23,208
Good! Now, that we're all together...

685
01:16:25,127 --> 01:16:28,255
Where is my money?

686
01:16:29,589 --> 01:16:31,258
What money?

687
01:16:31,258 --> 01:16:35,429
Don't fuck with me!
Tell me where my money is!

688
01:16:35,846 --> 01:16:38,974
And I will spare your life!

689
01:17:10,255 --> 01:17:12,591
What's so funny?

690
01:17:12,591 --> 01:17:14,926
Actually nothing...

691
01:17:14,926 --> 01:17:18,096
I see...
Where did we leave off?

692
01:17:19,222 --> 01:17:22,351
Yes... the money.

693
01:17:23,602 --> 01:17:27,773
We mailed it to various people.
There is nothing left.

694
01:17:33,945 --> 01:17:37,074
Why are you making it so hard for me?

695
01:17:38,116 --> 01:17:40,994
Unfortunately I have to kill you now!

696
01:17:41,036 --> 01:17:47,292
Go for it! I will die soon anyway.
I've got a cerebral tumour, I don't care!

697
01:17:50,087 --> 01:17:53,215
Then I will kill you!

698
01:17:53,215 --> 01:17:55,384
I don't want to piss you off, but...

699
01:17:55,384 --> 01:18:01,056
I've got bone cancer, late stage,
I don't care either!

700
01:18:01,056 --> 01:18:03,642
SHUT UP!

701
01:18:03,642 --> 01:18:06,770
I'll kill you now!

702
01:20:33,583 --> 01:20:36,712
Here we are...

703
01:20:39,005 --> 01:20:42,134
Can you taste the salt?

704
01:20:46,304 --> 01:20:49,433
Rudi?

705
01:20:51,226 --> 01:20:54,312
I've got to tell you something!

706
01:20:56,314 --> 01:21:00,485
I know.
But let me tell you something:

707
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:05,699
You don't have to be afraid!

708
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:20,894

Spread your legs!

711
01:27:57,986 --> 01:28:00,072
Hey, what's going on?

712
01:28:09,873 --> 01:28:12,167
Where did this come from?

713
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:13,293
From Santa Claus?

714
01:28:13,335 --> 01:28:16,421
From Santa Claus? No!
There was a letter in my mailbox!

715
01:28:17,297 --> 01:28:18,715
In your mailbox?

716
01:28:18,757 --> 01:28:20,842
From Rudi and Martin!

717
01:28:21,259 --> 01:28:24,346
- From Rudi and Martin?
- That was written on it!

718
01:28:24,471 --> 01:28:27,599
I don't even know them!
I promise!

719
01:28:27,724 --> 01:28:36,066
Supposed you are telling the truth
and this was in your mailbox-

720
01:28:36,149 --> 01:28:38,735
- who the fuck are Rudi and Martin?
