{1079}{1145}{y:i}Oh, the snow's pure and white
{1151}{1260}{y:i}On the earth rich and brown
{1266}{1337}{y:i}Just another Sunday morning

{3171}{3282}When you die and go to hell,|you can answer to Satan!
{3301}{3343}{y:i}You can see your breath|{y:i}Hanging in the air
{3349}{3398}{y:i}You see homeless people|{y:i}But you just don't care

{5462}{5518}{y:i}Where we learn everything|{y:i}That we know

{6008}{6091}Can I have five tickets to|Terrance and Phillip "Asses of Fire"?
{6097}{6164}No.
{6173}{6193}What do you mean?
{6199}{6289}"Asses of Fire" is rated R by the|Motion Picture Association of America.
{6295}{6346}You must be accompanied|by a parent or guardian.
{6352}{6403}- Why?|- This movie has naughty language!
{6409}{6458}Next, please.
{6464}{6519}- This can't be happening.|- We have to see it.
{6525}{6573}Screw it.|It probably isn't good anyway.
{6579}{6635}Cartman, what do you mean?|You love Terrance and Phillip.
{6641}{6720}But the animation's all crappy.
{6745}{6791}Wait. I've got an idea.
{6797}{6868}Hi. I want six tickets|to "Asses of Fire".
{6874}{6925}This movie may not be appropriate|for the little ones.
{6931}{6983}He says this movie|isn't appropriate for you.
{6989}{7049}Mr. Homeless Guy,|if you don't want $10...
{7055}{7107}...to buy a bottle of vodka,|then be my guest.
{7113}{7177}Six tickets, please.

{7398}{7462}The movie's starting.
{7546}{7565}Hooray!
{7571}{7657}{y:i}Terrance, what did the Spanish priest|{y:i}say to the Iranian gynecologist?
{7663}{7734}{y:i}I don't know, Phillip. What?
{7769}{7803}Where do they find this stuff?
{7809}{7868}{y:i}You're such a pig-fucker, Phillip.
{7874}{7893}What did he say?
{7899}{7938}{y:i}Why'd you call me a pig-fucker?
{7944}{8014}{y:i}Well, let's see.|{y:i}First of all, you fuck pigs.

{10775}{10809}Where have you been all day?
{10815}{10923}Nowhere. We just went to go see|the Terrance and Phillip movie.
{10931}{10953}How'd you get in?
{10959}{11054}Stop crowding us,|shit-faced cockmasters!
{11056}{11145}You're all ass-ramming uncle-fuckers.
{11149}{11178}We've got to see this movie.
{11184}{11277}Terrance and Phillip are Canadian,|just like my brother.
{11323}{11363}{y:i}There's the girl that I like
{11369}{11458}Tell about when Terrance called Phillip|a testicle-shitting rectal wart.
{11464}{11494}{y:i}Now more than ever
{11500}{11540}{y:i}She gives me butterflies
{11546}{11632}{y:i}It makes my stomach queasy|{y:i}Every time she walks by
{11638}{11671}Asshole, I'm talking to you.
{11677}{11779}{y:i}I know I can be cool|{y:i}If I try
{11797}{11845}Gross!
{11851}{11916}Wendy, let us try to jump|the hilly brush.
{11922}{11946}Who are you?
{11952}{12045}Gregory. I transferred from Yardale,|where I had a 4.0 grade point average.
{12051}{12076}Want to skate with us?
{12082}{12173}We've been skating all morning,|laughing and talking of memories past.
{12179}{12243}We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie.
{12249}{12317}Try and catch me, Wendy.
{12321}{12393}Bye, Stan.
{12464}{12539}I saw the Terrance and Phillip movie.|Who wants to touch me?
{12545}{12625}I said, who wants to fucking touch me?
{12640}{12738}We gotta see the|Terrance and Phillip movie too.
{12787}{12865}I hate you, Kenny.
{12963}{12996}{y:i}Shut your fucking face|{y:i}Uncle fucker
{13002}{13088}{y:i}You're a boner-biting bastard|{y:i}Uncle fucker
{13094}{13145}Okay, children, let's take our seats.
{13151}{13198}We have a lot to learn today.
{13204}{13250}We sure do, Mr. Hat.
{13256}{13326}Let's start the day|with a few new math problems.
{13332}{13416}What is five times two?
{13418}{13499}Don't be shy.|Just give it your best shot.
{13505}{13539}- Yes, Clyde.|- Twelve?
{13545}{13636}Now let's get an answer from|someone who's not a complete retard.
{13642}{13698}Anyone? Come on, don't be shy.
{13704}{13756}I think I know the answer,|Mr. Garrison.
{13762}{13827}- Shut up, fat boy!|- Don't call me fat, you fucking Jew!
{13833}{13904}- Eric! Did you just say the F-word?|- "Jew"?
{13910}{13981}You can't say "fuck" in school,|you fucking fat ass.
{13987}{14020}Why the fuck not?
{14026}{14087}You said "fuck" again.
{14099}{14166}What's the big deal? It doesn't|hurt anybody. Fuck, fuckitty, fuck.
{14172}{14225}How would you like to go see|the counselor?
{14231}{14301}How would you like to suck my balls?
{14307}{14342}What did you say?!
{14348}{14438}I'm sorry, I'm sorry.|Actually, what I said was...
{14444}{14581}..."How would you like to suck my balls,|Mr. Garrison?"
{14587}{14650}Holy shit, dude.
{14684}{14783}I'm disappointed in you boys.|You should be ashamed of yourselves.
{14789}{14830}I've called in your mothers...
{14836}{14870}- You called my mom?|- That's right.
{14876}{14902}Oh, no, dude!
{14908}{14966}- Mr. Mackey, can I ask a question?|- M'kay, what?
{14972}{15023}What's the big fucking deal?
{15029}{15115}I want to know where you heard|these horrific obscenities, m'kay?
{15121}{15210}- Nowhere.|- We heard them from Mr. Garrison before.
{15216}{15276}I seriously doubt|that Mr. Garrison ever said...
{15282}{15371}..."Eat penguin shit,|you ass-spelunker."
{15377}{15437}Sweet.
{15519}{15565}Thank you for coming on short notice.
{15571}{15600}This isn't like you, Stanley.
{15606}{15684}What did my son say, Mr. Mackey?|Did he say the S-word?
{15690}{15727}No, it was worse than that.
{15733}{15755}The F-word?
{15761}{15838}Here's a short list of the things|they've been saying.
{15844}{15905}- Oh, dear God.|- What the heck is a rim job?
{15911}{16052}When you put your legs behind your head|and have someone lick your ass.
{16053}{16184}Tell Mr. Mackey this instant where|you heard all these horrible phrases!
{16190}{16245}We all swore ourselves to secrecy.
{16251}{16289}- The Terrance and Phillip movie.|- Dude!
{16295}{16330}I wanna get out of here.
{16336}{16382}Terrance and Phillip? Those Canadians?
{16388}{16434}Excuse me.|What is Terrance and Phillip?
{16440}{16518}Terrance and Phillip are two|very untalented actors from Canada.
{16524}{16579}Nothing but foul language|and toilet humor!
{16585}{16689}I'll send a warning to parents before|more children see Terrance and Phillip.
{16695}{16732}Everybody's fucking seen it.
{16738}{16857}I can't help myself. That movie has|warped my fragile little mind.
{16995}{17080}{y:i}There's the girl that I like
{17087}{17150}{y:i}Over there laughing with that smart...
{17156}{17231}You're holding up|the goddamn lunch line!
{17237}{17277}Hello, there, children.
{17283}{17314}- Hey, Chef.|- How's it going?
{17320}{17346}- Bad.|- Why bad?
{17352}{17435}We got busted for swearing.|We can't ever see that movie again.
{17441}{17462}That's too bad.
{17468}{17531}You should've seen Kyle when|his mom showed up. He was scared.
{17537}{17610}- Shut up, Cartman!|- I'd be scared. Your mom's a bitch.
{17616}{17653}Don't call her a bitch,|you fat fuck!
{17659}{17702}Don't call me fat,|you fucking son of a bitch!
{17708}{17766}Where did you learn to talk like that?
{17772}{17802}Pretty fucking sweet, huh?
{17808}{17879}How do you make a woman like you|more than any other guy?
{17885}{17984}That's easy.|You just gotta find the clitoris.
{17991}{18026}What does "find the clitoris" mean?
{18032}{18066}Forget I said anything.
{18072}{18118}Move along.|You're holding up the line.
{18124}{18176}Do you know where I can find|the clitoris?
{18182}{18234}- The what?|- Is that like finding Jesus?
{18240}{18272}{y:i}Attention, students.
{18278}{18348}{y:i}We are now enforcing a new dress code|{y:i}at South Park Elementary.
{18354}{18414}{y:i}Terrance and Phillip shirts are|{y:i}not allowed in school.
{18420}{18536}{y:i}Anyone wearing a Terrance and Phillip|{y:i}shirt is to be sent home immediately.
{18542}{18614}Hooray!
{18684}{18765}{y:i}The Canadian film "Asses of Fire"|{y:i}is number one at the box office.
{18771}{18814}{y:i}Is the film destroying|{y:i}American youth?
{18820}{18878}{y:i}Here with a special report is|{y:i}a midget in a bikini.
{18884}{18970}{y:i}The effects of the Canadian comedy|{y:i}are far-reaching indeed.
{18976}{19081}{y:i}All over America, children seem to be|{y:i}influenced, like at this spelling bee.
{19087}{19136}This is for the silver medal.
{19142}{19189}Spell "forensics".
{19195}{19275}Why should I fucking|have to spell "forensics"?
{19281}{19355}Here you go. S-U-C-K-M-Y-A-S-S.
{19361}{19391}Forensics.
{19397}{19494}{y:i}The devastating impact of the duo|{y:i}can also be seen with their hit song...
{19500}{19554}{y:i}..."Shut Your Fucking Face,|{y:i}Uncle Fucker."
{19560}{19616}{y:i}Shut your fucking face|{y:i}Uncle fucker
{19622}{19709}{y:i}You're a boner-biting bastard|{y:i}Uncle fucker
{19715}{19753}{y:i}I told you that we won't stop
{19759}{19794}{y:i}I told you that we won't stop
{19800}{19825}{y:i}Back to you, Tom.
{19831}{19863}{y:i}Thanks. Shocking report.
{19869}{19926}{y:i}The controversy began|{y:i}in the town of South Park...
{19932}{19986}{y:i}... where the PTA is trying|{y:i}to ban the movie.
{19992}{20080}{y:i}With us tonight is the head of the PTA,|{y:i}Sheila Broflovski.
{20086}{20150}{y:i}- And the Canadian minister of movies.|{y:i}- Thanks for having me.
{20156}{20240}{y:i}Parents are concerned about your|{y:i}country's entertainment.
{20246}{20291}{y:i}The film isn't intended|{y:i}for children...
{20297}{20341}{y:i}But of course children will see it.
{20347}{20411}{y:i}Can I finish?|{y:i}We're surprised by your outrage.
{20417}{20481}{y:i}- You just don't care!|{y:i}- Can I finish? Hello?
{20487}{20548}{y:i}The U.S. has graphic violence|{y:i}on TV all the time.
{20554}{20610}{y:i}We can't believe a movie|{y:i}with foul language pisses you off.
{20616}{20661}{y:i}- Because it's evil!|{y:i}- Can I finish?!
{20667}{20726}{y:i}Please can I finish?!
{20732}{20757}{y:i}Okay, I'm finished.
{20763}{20846}{y:i}This film isn't the first|{y:i}troublesome thing to come out of Canada.
{20852}{20885}{y:i}Let's not forget Bryan Adams.
{20891}{20959}{y:i}Our government's apologized|{y:i}for Bryan Adams on several occasions.
{20965}{21056}{y:i}You Canadians are all the same,|{y:i}with your beady eyes and flapping heads.
{21062}{21100}{y:i}I resent that! I find that racist...
{21106}{21159}{y:i}Our children are now addicted|{y:i}to your puke!
{21165}{21189}{y:i}You are a racist!
{21195}{21350}{y:i}It'll take us weeks to erase the damage|{y:i}this film has done to our children.
{21371}{21458}Kids, I want to welcome you|to rehabilitation, m'kay?
{21464}{21525}Your mothers insisted you be taken|from your schoolwork...
{21531}{21591}...and placed into rehab to learn|not to swear.
{21597}{21634}I don't belong with these rogues.
{21640}{21701}I attended Yardale and had|a 4.0 grade point average.
{21707}{21765}- You're a fucking faggot.|- M'kay, you see?
{21771}{21868}This is what I'm talking about.|We have to get you off of foul language.
{21874}{21936}- How are we gonna do that?|- Listen here.
{21942}{22006}{y:i}There are times when you get|{y:i}Suckered in
{22012}{22094}{y:i}By drugs and alcohol|{y:i}And sex with women, m'kay?
{22100}{22155}{y:i}But it's when you|{y:i}Do these things too much
{22161}{22278}{y:i}That you've become an addict|{y:i}And must get back in touch
{22284}{22368}{y:i}You can do it|{y:i}It's all up to you, m'kay
{22374}{22461}{y:i}With a little plan|{y:i}You can change your life today
{22467}{22520}{y:i}Don't spend your life|{y:i}Addicted to smack
{22526}{22569}{y:i}Homeless|{y:i}Giving handjobs for crack
{22575}{22665}{y:i}Follow my plan|{y:i}And very soon you will say
{22671}{22720}{y:i}It's easy, m'kay
{22726}{22760}{y:i}Instead of "ass" say "buns"
{22766}{22820}{y:i}Like "Kiss my buns"|{y:i}Or "You're a buns-hole"
{22826}{22860}{y:i}Instead of "shit" say "poo"
{22866}{22920}{y:i}As in "bull poo", "poo-head"|{y:i}And "This poo is cold"
{22926}{22958}{y:i}With "bitch" drop the "T"
{22964}{23022}{y:i}'Cause "bich" is Latin|{y:i}For generosity
{23028}{23055}{y:i}Don't say "fuck" anymore
{23061}{23115}{y:i}'Cause "fuck" is the worst word|{y:i}That you can say
{23121}{23170}{y:i}So just use the word "m'kay"
{23176}{23261}{y:i}We can do it|{y:i}It's all up to us, m'kay
{23267}{23317}{y:i}With a little plan|{y:i}We can change our lives today
{23323}{23358}{y:i}You can change it today
{23364}{23416}{y:i}Don't spend your life|{y:i}Shooting up in the trash
{23422}{23466}{y:i}Homeless|{y:i}Giving handjobs for cash
{23472}{23538}{y:i}Follow this plan|{y:i}And very soon you will say
{23544}{23607}{y:i}It's easy, m'kay
{23613}{23633}{y:i}Step one
{23639}{23680}{y:i}- Say "buns"|{y:i}- Like "Kiss my buns"
{23686}{23714}{y:i}Or "You're a buns-hole"
{23720}{23750}{y:i}- Step two|{y:i}- Instead of "shit" say "poo"
{23756}{23816}{y:i}- As in "bull poo"|{y:i}- And "This poo is cold"
{23822}{23853}{y:i}- Step three|{y:i}- With "bitch" drop the "T"
{23859}{23914}{y:i}'Cause "bich" is Latin for generosity
{23920}{23955}{y:i}- Step four|{y:i}- Don't say "fuck" anymore
{23961}{24006}{y:i}It's the worst word|{y:i}You can say
{24012}{24053}{y:i}"Fuck" is the worst word|{y:i}That you can say
{24059}{24117}{y:i}We shouldn't say "fuck"|{y:i}Fuck no!
{24123}{24153}{y:i}You're cured, you can go
{24159}{24208}{y:i}Don't spend your life|{y:i}Shooting up in the trash
{24214}{24258}{y:i}Homeless|{y:i}Giving handjobs for cash
{24264}{24336}{y:i}Follow this plan|{y:i}And very soon you will say
{24342}{24417}{y:i}It's easy, m'kay
{24667}{24779}Now you're cured. Take the rest of the|afternoon off for personal reflection.
{24785}{24916}Find your own constructive way|to better yourself, m'kay?
{24926}{24981}{y:i}I hope you've learned|{y:i}something through this experience.
{24987}{25104}{y:i}I did. I learned that you are|{y:i}a boner-biting, dick-fart fuck-face.
{25118}{25200}{y:i}Want to see the northern lights?
{25223}{25293}{y:i}You burned yourself to death|{y:i}by lighting your fart.
{25299}{25358}{y:i}I sure did, Phillip.
{25364}{25469}{y:i}Uncle fucker! Good night.
{25475}{25556}Oh, man. This movie rules.
{25562}{25634}Man, that movie gets better|every time I see it.
{25640}{25700}That part about lighting farts|is bullshit.
{25706}{25743}- You can't do that.|- Yes, you can.
{25749}{25800}No way.
{25806}{25930}Okay, Kenny. I'll bet you $ 100|you can't light a fart on fire.
{26049}{26122}- Holy shit, dude!|- Look out!
{26128}{26164}Shit! Shit!
{26170}{26216}Help! Somebody do something!
{26222}{26291}This stick is on fire!
{26403}{26438}Oh, my God! You killed Kenny!
{26444}{26469}You bastard!
{26475}{26569}I guess you can light a fart on fire.
{26598}{26654}Load that IV with 70 cc's|of sodium Pentothal.
{26660}{26685}We called the parents.
{26691}{26764}Our moms will find out|we went to the movie again.
{26770}{26798}Vacuum!
{26804}{26875}Try to untangle his trachea|and esophagus.
{26881}{26961}No, that doesn't go there!
{26990}{27032}- Gross, Stan!|- That's sick!
{27038}{27097}- Watch his liver!|- I'll get it.
{27103}{27161}We have little time left.|We'll lose him soon.
{27167}{27196}His heart stopped.
{27202}{27286}Get it out of there.|Zap this, quick!
{27314}{27352}Who's making a potato?
{27358}{27386}My bad. I missed lunch.
{27392}{27455}Damn it, I'm not gonna lose this kid!
{27461}{27510}Close him up. We've done all we can.
{27516}{27613}The rest is up to God.
{27632}{27672}Kenny, can you hear me?
{27678}{27738}How are you feeling?
{27742}{27794}Great. Son, I have some bad news.
{27800}{27930}We replaced your heart with a potato.|You have three seconds to live.
{27947}{28012}- Fucking weak, dude!|- Oh, my God. They killed Kenny!
{28018}{28043}You bastards!
{28049}{28076}Damn it!
{28082}{28202}It never gets any easier!
{28240}{28305}I bet him he couldn't do it.|I bet him $100.
{28311}{28392}- It's not your fault.|- No, I'm stoked I don't have to pay.
{28398}{28478}That's real nice! He was your friend,|you fat fuck!
{28484}{28569}So, boys, you saw that movie again?
{28575}{28616}Well, Kyle, I have had it!
{28622}{28697}You are grounded|for the next two weeks!
{28703}{28723}Grounded?
{28729}{28765}And you, Stan. Come on.
{28771}{28821}And you're grounded|for three weeks, Eric.
{28827}{28875}Why am I grounded more?|That's bullshit.
{28881}{28903}What, what, what?!
{28909}{29006}What was that word, young man?
{29306}{29373}{y:i}Little boy at peace
{29379}{29416}{y:i}What is this place
{29422}{29476}{y:i}Beyond the stars
{29482}{29543}{y:i}Open up your eyes
{29549}{29584}{y:i}What are these things
{29590}{29640}{y:i}You're moving toward
{29646}{29714}{y:i}Head so full of wonder
{29720}{29774}{y:i}- Worries in the past
{29780}{29877}{y:i}Could it be|{y:i}That you are free at last
{29898}{29959}{y:i}No!
{30082}{30140}{y:i}Little boy, you're going to hell
{30146}{30215}{y:i}You said bad words, threw rocks at birds|{y:i}And now this is your hotel
{30221}{30318}{y:i}This ain't Disneyland, it's hell
{30323}{30380}{y:i}Little boy, it's time for you to pay
{30386}{30447}{y:i}For not going to church|{y:i}And staring at boobs every day
{30453}{30555}{y:i}Thought you were in bed|{y:i}Instead you're in hell
{30556}{30668}{y:i}No, hell isn't good|{y:i}Hell isn't good, hell
{30763}{30800}Fuck-face, have you seen Gracie?
{30806}{30926}There is orderliness in the universe.
{31214}{31282}Parents, our children are|out of control!
{31288}{31378}This is what happens when toilet humor|is allowed to run rampant!
{31384}{31428}That's right.|Kenny set himself on fire...
{31434}{31502}...because he saw Terrance and Phillip|do it in that dirty movie.
{31508}{31580}We must stop dirty language from|getting to our children's ears.
{31586}{31635}We must go fight the source of it!
{31641}{31675}But what is the source?
{31681}{31725}That's easy.
{31731}{31795}{y:i}Times have changed|{y:i}Our kids are getting worse
{31801}{31870}{y:i}They won't obey their parents|{y:i}They just want to fart and curse
{31876}{31908}{y:i}Should we blame the government
{31914}{31945}{y:i}Or blame society
{31951}{32008}{y:i}Or should we blame the images on TV
{32014}{32053}{y:i}No, blame Canada!
{32059}{32085}{y:i}Blame Canada
{32091}{32166}{y:i}With all their beady little eyes|{y:i}And flappin' heads so full of lies
{32172}{32200}{y:i}Blame Canada
{32206}{32238}{y:i}Blame Canada
{32244}{32341}{y:i}- We need to form a full assault|{y:i}- It's Canada's fault
{32341}{32396}{y:i}Don't blame me for my son Stan
{32402}{32477}{y:i}He saw the darn cartoon|{y:i}And now he's off to join the Klan
{32483}{32545}{y:i}And my boy Eric once|{y:i}Had my picture on his shelf
{32551}{32607}{y:i}But now when I see him|{y:i}He tells me to fuck myself
{32613}{32648}{y:i}Well, blame Canada
{32654}{32686}{y:i}Blame Canada
{32692}{32793}{y:i}It seems that everything's gone wrong|{y:i}Since Canada came along
{32847}{32920}{y:i}They're not even a real country anyway
{32926}{33000}{y:i}My son could've been a doctor|{y:i}Or a lawyer rich and true
{33006}{33075}{y:i}Instead he burned up like a piggy|{y:i}On a barbecue
{33081}{33114}{y:i}Should we blame the matches
{33120}{33197}{y:i}Should we blame the fire|{y:i}Or the doctors who allowed him to expire
{33203}{33250}Heck, no!|{y:i}Blame Canada
{33256}{33291}{y:i}Blame Canada
{33297}{33408}{y:i}- With all their hockey hullabaloo|{y:i}- And that bitch Anne Murray too
{33474}{33540}{y:i}The smut and trash we must bash|The laughs and fun must be undone
{33546}{33577}{y:i}We must lament and cause a fuss
{33583}{33694}{y:i}Before somebody thinks of blaming us
{33817}{33873}All right, you turds, listen up!
{33879}{33960}Your moms are at a meeting|and they put me in charge of you.
{33966}{34035}But you're still grounded,|so you're not allowed to have any fun!
{34041}{34066}Any questions?
{34072}{34141}Shelley, where's the clitoris?
{34165}{34225}You all sit there and keep|your mouths shut...
{34231}{34355}...while I go listen to|my Britney Spears records.
{34361}{34419}Okay, it's clear!
{34435}{34491}{y:i}Our next guests have|{y:i}the number one movie in the world.
{34497}{34598}{y:i}Please welcome Terrance and Phillip!
{34643}{34685}- Hello, Conan.|- Hello, Brooke Shields.
{34691}{34791}Some people claim that your Canadian|humor is just immature fart jokes.
{34797}{34895}That's not true.|Take this classic Canadian joke.
{34901}{34985}- Excuse me, Terrance.|- Yes, Phillip?
{35006}{35064}Gosh darn it!
{35064}{35108}- Good one. Cheers.|- Cheers, fuck-face.
{35114}{35155}You can't say that on TV.
{35161}{35212}Now Terrance smells like my ass.
{35218}{35336}I farted once on the set|of "Blue Lagoon".
{35387}{35444}Does it make you nervous to be|in America?
{35450}{35528}Our organizations want you|arrested for destroying children.
{35534}{35637}- They'd have to find us first.|- You're right. Now!
{35647}{35757}Mothers Against Canada is placing you|under citizen's arrest!
{35763}{35801}- Mom?|- What's going on?
{35807}{35853}We have a court order for your arrest!
{35859}{35893}Phillip, we've been ambushed!
{35899}{35933}Here you go, Conan.
{35939}{36015}This little scrotum-sucker deceived us!|You are a bad man!
{36021}{36043}Don't listen to them.
{36049}{36107}You loved our movie, Conan.|We watched it together.
{36113}{36146}Remember? You laughed.
{36152}{36237}What have I done?
{36394}{36509}Did you see that?|They arrested Terrance and Phillip!
{36602}{36625}As Canadian ambassador...
{36631}{36731}...I condemn America's actions|in apprehending Terrance and Phillip.
{36737}{36815}The entire economy of Canada relies|on Terrance and Phillip.
{36821}{36886}Without them,|we'd have a recession.
{36892}{36976}What say you,|Mr. American Ambassador?
{37013}{37036}Fuck Canada!
{37042}{37068}Fuck you, buddy!
{37074}{37113}Terrance and Phillip|will not be released.
{37119}{37187}They'll be put on trial|for corrupting America's youth.
{37193}{37230}What's all the fuss about?
{37236}{37335}The fuss is aboot taking our citizens!|It's aboot not censoring our art!
{37341}{37405}It's aboot...|What's so goddamn funny?
{37411}{37516}Nothing. Could you tell us again|what your argument is all about?
{37522}{37605}This is not aboot diplomacy. This is|aboot dignity. It's aboot respect.
{37611}{37683}Aboot realizing that humor...
{37684}{37809}Release them, or we'll|give you something to cry aboot!
{38092}{38154}{y:i}Pilot to bombardier.|{y:i}We're nearing the target.
{38160}{38194}Bomb's ready, buddy.
{38200}{38241}Baldwin residence.
{38247}{38283}No, this is Billy Baldwin.
{38289}{38360}If you want Daniel Baldwin,|call his extension, stupid!
{38366}{38430}Alec, do you know what sucks|about being a Baldwin?
{38436}{38532}- No. What?|- Nothing!
{38665}{38737}You missed me!
{38789}{38900}Your mothers are making me throw away|my lesson plan and teach theirs.
{38906}{38995}How come our moms arrested|Terrance and Phillip?
{38996}{39080}Your moms are just upset.|They're probably all on their periods.
{39086}{39108}Not cool.
{39114}{39188}Wendy and I think|that was a sexist statement.
{39194}{39299}Sorry, but I don't trust anything that|bleeds for five days and doesn't die.
{39305}{39376}Anyway, children, let's start off|with some vocabulary.
{39382}{39408}{y:i}Attention, students.
{39414}{39435}What now?
{39441}{39587}{y:i}Come to the gymnasium immediately|{y:i}for a special announcement.
{39610}{39668}- What's going on, Chef?|- Something big, children.
{39674}{39724}I can't find the clitoris.|You have to help.
{39730}{39762}Stan, the clitoris is...
{39768}{39860}Take your seats.|They're about to announce it.
{39860}{39897}{y:i}This is a state of emergency.
{39903}{39991}{y:i}Now to the White House for|{y:i}an announcement from the President.
{39997}{40029}{y:i}My fellow Americans...
{40035}{40148}{y:i}... at 5 a.m. Today,|{y:i}a day which will live in infamy...
{40154}{40230}{y:i}... the Canadians have bombed|{y:i}the Baldwins.
{40236}{40386}{y:i}In response to this, the U.S. has|{y:i}declared war on Canada.
{40402}{40441}- Oh, no.|- War?
{40447}{40517}- No, Gregory, no!|- This is bad. Hold on to me.
{40523}{40561}All the Baldwins are dead?
{40567}{40633}{y:i}It's time for us to send|{y:i}a message to Canadians.
{40639}{40718}{y:i}In two days, the war criminals,|{y:i}Terrance and Phillip...
{40724}{40778}{y:i}... will be executed.
{40784}{40813}They're gonna kill them?
{40819}{40903}{y:i}And now I'd like to bring up my newly|{y:i}appointed Secretary of Offense...
{40909}{40958}{y:i}... Ms. Sheila Broflovski.
{40964}{40989}Holy shit, dude!
{40995}{41023}{y:i}My fellow Americans...
{41029}{41123}{y:i}... our neighbor to the north|{y:i}has abused us for the last time!
{41129}{41179}{y:i}- I have a plan...|{y:i}- Canadians want to fight us...
{41185}{41256}{y:i}... because we won't tolerate|{y:i}their potty-mouths.
{41262}{41310}{y:i}If it is war they want...
{41316}{41414}{y:i}... then war they shall have!
{41426}{41468}Dude, this is fucking weak.
{41474}{41566}How could things be any worse?
{41797}{41863}Fallen one, I am Satan.
{41869}{41968}I am your god now.
{41998}{42081}There is no escape.
{42126}{42196}Now feel the delightful pain.
{42202}{42245}Hey, Satan.
{42251}{42338}Did you hear the news?|A war just broke out up on Earth.
{42344}{42439}Meet Saddam Hussein,|my new partner in evil.
{42445}{42500}You're hogging all the fun.
{42506}{42593}Man, this is getting me so hot!
{42599}{42641}Would you let me do my job?
{42647}{42701}Rub my nipples while I torture|this little piggy.
{42707}{42798}Could I talk to you over here?
{42814}{42898}I don't see why you have to belittle me|in front of people like that.
{42904}{42935}Relax, guy.
{42941}{43009}Sometimes, I think you don't have|any respect for me.
{43015}{43081}Come here, guy.
{43087}{43125}Who's my cream puff?
{43131}{43221}- I am.|- That's my baby.
{43281}{43305}I don't wanna be at war.
{43311}{43355}You think they'll kill|Terrance and Phillip?
{43361}{43435}Kyle, stop being a chicken shit|and stand up to your mother.
{43441}{43509}Smack her and say, "That's enough|of your shit, you bitch!"
{43515}{43557}Don't call my mom a bitch!
{43563}{43645}Stop it! This isn't helping.|We've gotta think. Let's see.
{43651}{43779}- What would Brian Boitano do?|- Yeah, what would Brian Boitano do?
{43819}{43846}What's going on?
{43852}{43913}America thinks it has the right|to police the world.
{43919}{44010}Your government will kill two Canadians,|an action condemned by the U.N.
{44016}{44089}Home of the free, indeed.
{44092}{44132}Let's play tetherball.
{44138}{44195}This is about freedom of speech!|About censorship!
{44201}{44228}Be more political...
{44234}{44320}{y:i}There's the girl that I like
{44324}{44413}{y:i}Now it appears|{y:i}That she likes another guy
{44419}{44535}{y:i}It must be because|{y:i}He's political and stuff
{44541}{44603}{y:i}I bet I could be political too
{44609}{44688}What do you think, Stan?
{44688}{44709}Damn it!
{44715}{44784}- This is all Kyle's mom's fault.|- Shut up, Cartman!
{44790}{44829}Kyle's mom started that damn club.
{44835}{44961}- All because she's a fat, stupid bitch.|- Don't say it, Cartman!
{44967}{45047}Don't do it, Cartman.
{45049}{45109}I'm warning you!
{45115}{45165}I'm sick of him calling my mom a...
{45171}{45230}{y:i}Kyle's mom's a witch|{y:i}The biggest bitch in the world
{45236}{45323}{y:i}She's a stupid bitch|{y:i}She's a bitch to all the boys and girls
{45329}{45384}Shut your fucking mouth, Cartman!
{45390}{45455}{y:i}Monday and Tuesday she's a bitch|{y:i}Wednesday to Saturday she's a bitch
{45461}{45559}{y:i}On Sunday just to be different|{y:i}She's a super King Kamehameha bitch
{45565}{45601}Come on, you all know the words.

{45831}{45894}{y:i}Kyle's mom's a bitch|{y:i}And she's just a dirty bitch
{45900}{46002}{y:i}Talk to kids around the world|{y:i}It might go something like this
{46260}{46290}{y:i}Have you met Kyle's mom
{46296}{46325}{y:i}She's the biggest bitch|{y:i}In the world

{46634}{46747}{y:i}She's a big fat fucking bitch
{46753}{46861}{y:i}Big old fat fucking bitch|{y:i}Kyle's mom
{46970}{47030}What?
{47036}{47084}Oh, fuck.
{47090}{47143}{y:i}Everyone, settle down.
{47149}{47203}As we continue to send troops|into Canada...
{47209}{47290}...M.A.C. is also fighting the war|against potty-mouths here at home.
{47296}{47433}Here to present the V-chip|is Dr. Vosknocker.
{47468}{47517}The machinery of the V-chip|is very simple.
{47523}{47563}It is placed under the child's skin...
{47569}{47667}...emitting a small shock of electricity|whenever an obscenity is uttered.
{47673}{47750}Wait a minute. This chip somehow knows|if the child is swearing?
{47756}{47782}It's like a lie detector.
{47788}{47856}Certain things happen to you|when you swear, just like when you lie.
{47862}{47939}The chip picks up on this and gives|the subject a little prick.
{47945}{48011}Patient B-5, would you|step out here, please?
{48017}{48096}Patient B-5 here has been fitted|with the new V-chip.
{48102}{48122}My head hurts.
{48128}{48221}Don't worry about that.|Now, I want you to say "doggy".
{48227}{48247}Doggy.
{48253}{48296}Notice that nothing happens.
{48302}{48367}- Now say "Montana".|- Montana.
{48373}{48392}Good.
{48398}{48430}Now, "pillow".
{48436}{48464}Pillow.
{48470}{48563}All right. Now I want you to say|"horse-fucker".
{48569}{48612}Go ahead, Eric. It's all right.
{48618}{48681}Horse-fuck...
{48687}{48724}That hurt, goddamn...
{48730}{48750}Fuck!
{48756}{48839}Now I'd like you to say|"big, floppy donkey dick".
{48845}{48915}Success!|The child doesn't want to swear!
{48921}{48965}This isn't fair, you sons of bitches!
{48971}{49111}We will start putting V-chips|in all our children next week!
{49141}{49220}{y:i}Snacky Smores presents:|The March of War.
{49226}{49256}{y:i}Let's hear it for our boys.
{49262}{49346}{y:i}Clinton has called them|{y:i}to fight the evil Canadians.
{49352}{49409}{y:i}A full-scale attack was launched|{y:i}on Toronto...
{49415}{49515}{y:i}... after the Canadians' last bombing,|{y:i}which devastated the Arquettes.
{49521}{49583}{y:i}For security measures,|{y:i}our great government is rounding up...
{49589}{49656}{y:i}... all citizens with Canadian blood|{y:i}and putting them into camps.
{49662}{49749}{y:i}Canadian-Americans are to report|{y:i}to one of these death camps right away.
{49755}{49790}{y:i}Did I say "death camps"?
{49796}{49855}{y:i}I meant happy camps,|{y:i}where you will eat the finest meals...
{49861}{49917}{y:i}... have access to fabulous doctors|{y:i}and exercise regularly.
{49923}{50016}{y:i}Meanwhile, war criminals Terrance|{y:i}and Phillip are prepped for execution.
{50022}{50056}{y:i}Their execution will take place...
{50062}{50143}{y:i}... during a fabulous USO show,|{y:i}with guest celebrities, including...
{50149}{50197}{y:i}... Big Gay Al and Winona Ryder.
{50203}{50297}{y:i}Of course, the only way to see the|{y:i}USO show is to sign up for the Army!
{50303}{50393}{y:i}So join the Army and kill|{y:i}some Canadian scum as we continue...
{50399}{50511}{y:i}... the march of war.|{y:i}Eat Snacky Smores.
{50551}{50692}We must rid ourselves|of anything Canadian.
{50692}{50740}Don't you like|Terrance and Phillip anymore?
{50746}{50832}Course not! Mommy says I hate Canadians|because they made me have a dirty mouth.
{50838}{50893}Burn it all!
{50893}{50934}- Hey, dudes.|- What's the matter, Cartman?
{50940}{51030}It's this V-chip. I hate it.|I can't say any dirty words.
{51036}{51073}- So you can't say "fuck"?|- No.
{51079}{51120}- And you can't say "shit"?|- No.
{51126}{51195}You can't say, "I'm Cartman,|the fattest piece of shit in the world"?
{51201}{51246}- Fuck you!|- Dude. Sweet!
{51252}{51329}This has gone far enough.|It's time we talked to our moms.
{51335}{51366}We're supposed to be grounded.
{51372}{51427}Come on, it's time for us|to get political.
{51433}{51504}Canada will no longer corrupt|our children!
{51510}{51539}Mom, can I talk to you?
{51545}{51616}Kyle, what are you doing here?|You are grounded.
{51622}{51671}Get back to the house|and stay there!
{51677}{51706}You too, Stanley.
{51712}{51785}You're going too far.|You can't kill Terrance and Phillip.
{51791}{51841}We must fight for|our children's futures!
{51847}{51936}- You started a war. You have to stop it.|- To make them safe again!
{51942}{51995}Our children are precious.
{52001}{52112}We must make a stand now!|Stop at nothing!
{52118}{52144}I told you she wouldn't listen.
{52150}{52205}We'll have to save|Terrance and Phillip ourselves.
{52211}{52243}- What?|- Think about it.
{52249}{52273}What would Brian Boitano do?
{52279}{52340}He'd rescue Terrance and Phillip|before they're executed.
{52346}{52410}We can't do anything.|Our moms' organization is too strong.
{52416}{52486}We'll round up all the grounded kids|and start our own organization.
{52492}{52537}An organization to help save|Terrance and Phillip.
{52543}{52591}Yeah, our own secret club.
{52597}{52656}- I guess that could work.|- We have to try.
{52662}{52731}{y:i}What would Brian Boitano do|{y:i}If he was here right now
{52737}{52817}{y:i}He'd make a plan and follow through|{y:i}That's what Brian Boitano'd do
{52823}{52896}{y:i}When Brian Boitano was in the Olympics|{y:i}Skating for the gold
{52902}{52980}{y:i}He did two salchows and a triple lutz|{y:i}While wearing a blindfold
{52986}{53056}{y:i}When Brian Boitano was in the Alps|{y:i}Fighting grizzly bears
{53062}{53142}{y:i}He used his magical fire breath|{y:i}And saved the maidens fair
{53148}{53218}{y:i}So what would Brian Boitano do|{y:i}If he were here today
{53224}{53310}{y:i}I'm sure he'd kick an ass or two|{y:i}That's what Brian Boitano'd do
{53316}{53386}{y:i}I want this V-chip out of me
{53392}{53461}{y:i}It has stunted my vocabulary
{53467}{53550}{y:i}And I just want my mom|{y:i}To stop fighting everyone
{53556}{53627}{y:i}For Wendy, I'll be an activist|{y:i}That's what Brian Boitano'd do
{53633}{53709}{y:i}That's what Brian Boitano'd do|{y:i}He'd call the kids in town
{53715}{53800}{y:i}And tell them to unite for truth|{y:i}That's what Brian Boitano'd do
{53806}{53846}Someone say my name?
{53852}{53905}- Who are you?|- I'm Brian Dennehy.
{53911}{53959}What? No, not fucking Brian Dennehy!
{53965}{54045}Get the fuck out of here.
{54049}{54124}{y:i}When Brian Boitano traveled through time|{y:i}To the year 3010
{54130}{54213}{y:i}He fought the evil robot king|{y:i}To save the human race again
{54219}{54288}{y:i}When he built the pyramids|{y:i}He beat up Kublai Khan
{54294}{54419}{y:i}Because Brian Boitano|{y:i}Doesn't take shit from anybody
{54425}{54491}{y:i}So let's all stick together|{y:i}And unite to stop our moms
{54497}{54576}{y:i}We'll save Terrance and Phillip too|{y:i}That's what Brian Boitano'd do
{54582}{54696}{y:i}We'll save Terrance and Phillip too|{y:i}That's what Brian Boitano'd do
{54702}{54785}{y:i}That's what Brian Boitano'd do
{54871}{54916}Hey, relax, guy.
{54922}{54960}There's nothing on.
{54966}{55010}You get cranky when you're tired.
{55016}{55043}I'm not cranky.
{55049}{55156}{y:i}What started as a spat between the U.S.|{y:i}and Canada is turning into WWIII.
{55162}{55192}World War III?!
{55198}{55296}{y:i}Terrance and Phillip will be put|{y:i}to death for crimes...
{55302}{55396}It has come to be.|The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh.
{55402}{55463}The time of prophecy is upon us.
{55469}{55550}I love when you get biblical.|You know exactly how to turn my crank.
{55556}{55624}No, I'm being serious.|It is the seventh sign.
{55630}{55650}What?
{55656}{55680}Behold...
{55686}{55747}...the first signs of my reign|have all come true:
{55753}{55816}The fall of an empire,|the coming of a comet...
{55822}{55926}...and now, when the blood of|these Canadians touches American soil...
{55932}{56020}...it will be our time to rise.
{56026}{56096}Yeah, man, I'm getting so hot!|Let's fuck!
{56102}{56192}Do you always think about sex?|I'm talking about important stuff here.
{56198}{56271}I'm just excited about taking over|the world! Come on!
{56277}{56332}Is sex the only thing|that matters to you?
{56338}{56396}I love you.
{56402}{56430}I want to believe that.
{56436}{56543}What do you say we shut off|that light and get close?
{56623}{56722}You like that, don't you, bitch?
{56754}{56825}We can use my dad's computer to call|the kids together.
{56831}{56926}Before we put a message out,|do a search on "clitoris".
{56957}{57030}"Found: Eight million pages|with the word 'clitoris'."
{57036}{57138}I'll just try the first one.|"You must be 18 to enter this website."
{57144}{57192}"Welcome to German Sick Fetish Video."
{57198}{57305}"If you are under 18, do not..."|Well, okay.
{57342}{57376}It's a lady getting pooed on!
{57382}{57435}- Is it Cartman's mom?|- Very funny.
{57441}{57512}It is Cartman's mom!
{57527}{57597}Son of a bit...!
{57603}{57643}Lke, you're too young for this stuff.
{57649}{57668}Bullshitah.
{57674}{57747}What's she doing now?
{57846}{57878}Click it off, dude!
{57884}{57923}What's wrong with German people?
{57929}{57999}Let's do what we came here to do|and put a message out.
{58005}{58064}I've gotta put out|an all-access e-mail.
{58070}{58130}- Goddamn, your mom sucks!|- Get to the message board!
{58136}{58211}Can't find a Canadian server.|I'll break into the mainframe.
{58217}{58247}They've got an access code!
{58253}{58336}I'll try to re-route the encryptions.
{58393}{58458}Here we go. "Want to help|Terrance and Phillip?"
{58464}{58560}"Sneak out after you get tucked into bed|tonight and meet at Carl's warehouse."
{58566}{58616}- Tell them we'll have punch and pie.|- We're not.
{58622}{58708}More people will come if they think|we have punch and pie!
{58714}{58750}"Punch and pie."
{58756}{58836}"This is top-secret.|The password is..."
{58842}{58900}{y:i}"La Rsistance."
{58906}{58951}{y:i}So the draft will begin tomorrow...
{58957}{59015}{y:i}... as more troops are needed|{y:i}to invade the Canadian border.
{59021}{59095}{y:i}The Canadian government pleads|{y:i}for a peaceful resolution...
{59101}{59135}{y:i}... but we're not listening.
{59141}{59166}Good night, hon.
{59172}{59226}Mom, when will the war be over?
{59232}{59381}I don't know, hon. Soon, we hope.|You want it to end quickly, huh?
{59387}{59432}- Mom?|- Yes, hon?
{59438}{59552}If you were in a German "scheie" video,|you'd tell me, right?
{59558}{59626}Sure, hon. Good night.
{59847}{59906}There's a ghost!
{59912}{59976}Kenny, is that you?
{60005}{60068}Satan? Satan is coming here?
{60074}{60164}Saddam Hussein?|That doesn't make sense!
{60215}{60236}Eric, what is it?
{60242}{60273}I saw him! I saw Kenny!
{60279}{60311}You poor dear.
{60317}{60356}You've been through so much.
{60362}{60432}I bet him he couldn't light a fart|on fire, and now he's pissed off.
{60438}{60515}I can't say "pissed off"?
{60529}{60582}The execution of Terrance and Phillip|is imminent.
{60588}{60701}Soon, Saddam and I will rule the world.
{60702}{60768}I got some new luggage|for our trip up to Earth.
{60774}{60800}Let's fuck to celebrate!
{60806}{60866}What's it like up on Earth?|Tell me about it again.
{60872}{60924}Let's not talk. Let's get busy.
{60930}{60969}Remember when you first got here?
{60975}{61047}We used to talk all night,|until the sun came up.
{61053}{61114}We would just lie in bed and talk.
{61120}{61176}Because I was waiting to|get you in bed.
{61182}{61239}How come you always want to make love|to me from behind?
{61245}{61307}Is it because you want to pretend|I'm somebody else?
{61313}{61368}Satan, your ass is gigantic and red.
{61374}{61463}Who am I gonna pretend you are?|Liza Minnelli?
{61481}{61569}Don't get all pissy!
{61711}{61778}{y:i}Sometimes I think
{61784}{61849}{y:i}When I look up real high
{61855}{61926}{y:i}That there's such a big world up there
{61932}{62009}{y:i}I'd like to give it a try
{62015}{62063}{y:i}But then I sink
{62069}{62136}{y:i}'Cause it's here I'm supposed to stay
{62142}{62203}{y:i}But I get so lonely down here
{62209}{62324}{y:i}Tell me, why's it have to be that way?
{62330}{62391}{y:i}Up there, there is so much room
{62397}{62461}{y:i}Where babies burp and flowers bloom
{62467}{62538}{y:i}Everyone dreams, I can dream too
{62544}{62573}{y:i}Up there
{62579}{62659}{y:i}Up where the skies are ocean blue
{62665}{62751}{y:i}I could be safe and live without a care
{62757}{62836}{y:i}Up there
{62842}{62902}{y:i}They say I don't belong
{62908}{62980}{y:i}I must stay below alone
{62986}{63028}{y:i}Because of my beliefs
{63034}{63145}{y:i}I'm supposed to stay where evil is sown
{63151}{63189}{y:i}But what is evil anyway
{63195}{63261}{y:i}Is there reason to the rhyme
{63267}{63314}{y:i}Without evil there could be no good
{63320}{63446}{y:i}So it must be good to be evil sometimes
{63452}{63517}{y:i}Up there, there is so much room
{63523}{63586}{y:i}Where babies burp and flowers bloom
{63592}{63662}{y:i}Everyone dreams, I can dream too
{63668}{63698}{y:i}Up there
{63704}{63785}{y:i}Up where the skies are ocean blue
{63791}{63895}{y:i}I could be safe and live without a care
{63901}{63961}{y:i}Live without a care
{63967}{64082}{y:i}If only I could live up there
{64085}{64180}{y:i}I want to live, I want to live up
{64262}{64394}{y:i}I want to live up there
{64636}{64676}- You're late!|- I had to ride my bike here.
{64682}{64732}- My behind is killing me.|- Your "behind"?
{64738}{64806}I have to say "behind" because|I get shocked if I say "ass".
{64812}{64837}Did you bring the punch and pie?
{64843}{64895}No. You guys, something happened.
{64901}{64950}I don't think Kenny's dead.
{64956}{64980}I saw him in my room.
{64986}{65038}I know, Cartman.|I see Kenny every day.
{65044}{65070}- You do?|- Sure, dude.
{65076}{65155}On the face of every child,|on the smile of every baby.
{65161}{65240}This was Kenny! He said that if|Terrance and Phillip die...
{65246}{65323}...Saddam Hussein and Satan will|come up and rule the world!
{65329}{65400}Saddam Hussein?
{65480}{65505}Who is it?
{65511}{65543}I'm here for "La Rsistance".
{65549}{65570}What's the password?
{65576}{65603}I don't know.
{65609}{65654}Guess.
{65660}{65727}Bacon.
{65762}{65810}"Viva La Rsistance"!
{65816}{65843}Oh, no! It's that kid!
{65849}{65896}This is the place.
{65902}{65978}Stan? You started "La Rsistance"?
{65984}{66029}You're more political than we thought.
{66035}{66131}Let us get this meeting underway.|Many others are coming.
{66169}{66234}A lot of people showed up.
{66278}{66427}Terrance and Phillip are supposed to be|killed, and we think that sucks ass!
{66457}{66518}We were to understand there'd be|pie and punch.
{66524}{66582}There isn't any.
{66648}{66703}Terrance and Phillip are|supposed to be killed...
{66709}{66760}...so we should prank call|a bunch of policemen...
{66766}{66820}...and have pizzas sent to them|that they didn't order.
{66826}{66910}"Viva La Rsistance"!
{66945}{66987}- May I?|- What?
{66993}{67077}Terrance and Phillip are being held|in a camp two kilometers from town.
{67083}{67148}They are to be executed tomorrow|during a star-studded USO show.
{67154}{67175}Tomorrow?
{67181}{67215}Once the show begins,|we'll have an hour...
{67221}{67276}...to get them out of their cell|and into this clearing.
{67282}{67361}There, we will rendezvous|and take them back to Canada.
{67367}{67415}Dude, Wendy's new guy is smart.
{67421}{67470}Meet me at the rendezvous point|at 10 p.m.
{67476}{67544}Sneaking in and breaking them out|will be dangerous...
{67550}{67609}...so I'll go myself.
{67610}{67658}No! We're going!
{67664}{67740}We started "La Rsistance". We'll get|them and meet at the rendezvous point.
{67746}{67805}This will be very dangerous.|Are you quite sure?
{67811}{67831}Fuck that!
{67837}{67977}Do you want that V-chip in you forever?|We'll go. Let's run through the plan.
{68182}{68299}Oh, boy! Military action, Ned!|Let's kill us some goddamn Australians!
{68305}{68356}I think we're fighting Canadians.
{68362}{68408}Canadians, Australians,|what's the difference?
{68414}{68519}This uniform makes me feel like|a tough, brute man, Mr. Hat.
{68525}{68566}It sure does, Mr. Garrison.
{68572}{68616}I can't wait|for our first shore leave...
{68622}{68701}...so I can get me|some fucking poon tang.
{68707}{68805}Pay attention! Tomorrow night is|the USO show for all you troops.
{68811}{68928}There will be celebrities, followed by|the execution of Terrance and Phillip.
{68938}{69035}After the show, we will finally be|sending ground troops into Canada.
{69041}{69068}So let's strategize.
{69074}{69112}Map!
{69118}{69167}Our sources have told us|that the Canadians...
{69173}{69242}...are preparing for our invasion,|so we must use caution.
{69248}{69299}Each battalion has|a specific code name and mission.
{69305}{69356}Battalion 5, raise your hands.
{69362}{69418}You will be the all-important|first attack wave...
{69424}{69483}...which we will call|"Operation Human Shield".
{69489}{69515}Wait a minute!
{69521}{69590}Keep in mind Operation Human Shield|will suffer heavy losses.
{69596}{69640}Battalion 14?
{69646}{69706}Right. You are|Operation Get-Behind-the-Darkies.
{69712}{69796}You will follow Battalion 5.|Try not to get killed, for God's sake.
{69802}{69845}Are there any questions?
{69851}{69870}Yes, soldier.
{69876}{69934}Have you ever heard|of the Emancipation Proclamation?
{69940}{69976}I don't listen to hip-hop.
{69982}{70078}After that, we will march into|the heart of Canada, and we will...
{70084}{70123}{y:i}I'm gonna get you!
{70129}{70184}What's wrong with this thing?
{70190}{70227}It's fucking Windows 98!
{70233}{70299}Get Bill Gates in here!
{70352}{70446}You told us Windows 98 would be faster,|with better access to the Internet!
{70452}{70534}It is faster. Over 5 million...
{70534}{70571}All right, men, get lots of rest...
{70577}{70678}...and prepare to...
{70715}{70769}After you have Terrance and Phillip,|make your way to this ridge.
{70775}{70821}We will wait for you.|But not for long.
{70827}{70881}So if you're not there at 10,|we'll have to leave.
{70887}{70961}You're brave, but you'll need help|from someone who's done this before.
{70967}{71028}Here's the address of "The Mole".
{71034}{71126}He is an expert in covert operations.|Your first task will be obtaining him.
{71132}{71240}Get lots of sleep. Tomorrow we will|all be risking our lives for freedom.
{71246}{71354}{y:i}God has smiled upon you this day
{71360}{71472}{y:i}The fate of a nation in your hands
{71478}{71535}{y:i}And blessed be the children here
{71541}{71603}{y:i}Who fight with all our bravery
{71609}{71721}{y:i}Till only the righteous stand
{71727}{71803}{y:i}You see the distant flames|{y:i}They bellow in the night
{71809}{71886}{y:i}You fight in all our names|{y:i}For what we know is right
{71892}{71961}{y:i}And when you all get shot|{y:i}And cannot carry on
{71967}{72042}{y:i}Though you die, "La Rsistance" lives on
{72048}{72120}{y:i}You may get stabbed in the head|{y:i}With a dagger or a sword
{72126}{72203}{y:i}You may be burned to death|{y:i}Or skinned alive or worse
{72209}{72278}{y:i}But when they torture you|{y:i}You will not feel the need to run
{72284}{72352}{y:i}For though you die,|{y:i}"La Rsistance" lives on
{72358}{72428}{y:i}Blame Canada|{y:i}Blame Canada
{72434}{72531}{y:i}Because the country's gone awry|{y:i}Tomorrow night these freaks will fry
{72537}{72605}{y:i}Tomorrow night|{y:i}Our lives will change
{72611}{72681}{y:i}Tomorrow night|{y:i}We'll be entertained
{72687}{72775}{y:i}An execution, what a sight|{y:i}Tomorrow night
{72781}{72845}{y:i}Up there, there's so much room|{y:i}Where babies burp and flowers bloom
{72851}{72923}{y:i}Tomorrow night up there is doomed|{y:i}And so I will be going soon
{72929}{72983}{y:i}Shut your fucking face|{y:i}Uncle fucker
{72989}{73065}{y:i}You're a boner-biting bastard|{y:i}Uncle fucker
{73071}{73148}{y:i}- Looks like we may be out of luck|{y:i}- Tomorrow night, we're pretty fucked
{73154}{73214}{y:i}Why did our mothers start this war|{y:i}What the fuck are they fighting for
{73220}{73286}{y:i}When did this song become a marathon
{73292}{73360}{y:i}When Canada is dead and gone|{y:i}There'll be no more Celine Dion
{73366}{73427}{y:i}They may cut your dick in half|{y:i}And serve it to a pig
{73433}{73514}{y:i}And though it hurts, you'll laugh|{y:i}And dance a dickless jig
{73520}{73577}{y:i}That's the way it goes|{y:i}In war you're shat upon
{73583}{73698}{y:i}Though you die|{y:i}"La Rsistance" lives on
{73973}{74061}I'm so excited. Just one more day|until we can take over the world.
{74067}{74124}I don't know if I can sleep,|if you know what I mean.
{74130}{74219}This book talks about how people|communicate differently.
{74225}{74302}I communicate by wanting you|to ask me questions, and you...
{74308}{74363}That is interesting. Let's fuck!
{74369}{74474}Saddam, I'm trying to have|a nice conversation with you!
{74480}{74537}Now that is just not appropriate!
{74543}{74612}Come on, I'm just fucking with you!|It's not real!
{74618}{74711}- Well, that's still not appropriate.|- Hey, daddy.
{74717}{74807}It's not real, either! Come on, guy!
{74931}{75037}Soon the world will belong to me.
{75061}{75141}It's Saddam.|He doesn't nurture my emotions.
{75147}{75251}He just wants sex and can't learn|to communicate.
{75257}{75325}You're right. I should leave him.|I'll tell him...
{75331}{75392}..."Saddam, I'm going to Earth|to rule alone!"
{75398}{75510}I'm strong and I don't need him!
{75568}{75616}{y:i}Today's the day for the USO show
{75622}{75666}{y:i}We're so happy we get to go
{75672}{75720}{y:i}I don't know but I've been told
{75726}{75760}{y:i}Canadian pussy is mighty cold
{75766}{75816}Stay in the attic,|because if they find you...
{75822}{75901}...they'll put you in|a concentration camp.
{75902}{75951}Don't worry.|We'll put an end to this.
{75957}{76072}Then I'll make Mom come home,|and we'll all be a family again.
{76577}{76621}We need to speak with The Mole.
{76627}{76715}I'm sorry. The Mole is grounded.|He can't come out and play.
{76721}{76746}- What?!|- He's a kid?
{76752}{76802}He said very naughty things about God.
{76808}{76865}Can we just talk to him|for five seconds?
{76871}{76981}Well, all right. Christophe!
{76984}{77073}We're gonna rescue Terrance|and Phillip from the USO show...
{77079}{77098}Who sent you?
{77104}{77144}Gregory! He said|you could sneak us in.
{77150}{77206}Are you telling me you intend|to break into the USO show...
{77212}{77286}...filled with thousands of soldiers|and break out Terrance and Phillip?
{77292}{77333}I thought it was a stupid idea too.
{77339}{77421}We're "La Rsistance". We wanna save|Terrance and Phillip and stop the war.
{77427}{77494}I can't help you.|I'm grounded for the next three days.
{77500}{77552}So are we. Our parents think|we're home right now.
{77558}{77591}- Why are you grounded?|- Why?
{77597}{77669}Because God hates me.|He has made my life miserable.
{77675}{77736}So I call Him a cocksucking asshole,|and I get grounded.
{77742}{77783}- So will you help us?|- Very well.
{77789}{77858}Meet me in the backyard|in five minutes. "Viva La Rsistance."
{77864}{77905}We'll show God that we won't fucking...
{77911}{77945}What? Christophe, get in here!
{77951}{78010}Coming, mother.
{78016}{78090}I must be strong. I must be strong.
{78096}{78140}Saddam, I need to talk to you.
{78146}{78236}Get packing, bitch. We have to go!|We're running out of time!
{78242}{78318}Saddam, sometimes you can love|a person very much...
{78324}{78366}...but still know|they aren't right for you.
{78372}{78410}What are you talking about?
{78416}{78470}You treat me like shit!|I'm leaving you!
{78476}{78542}I'm going up to Earth to rule alone.
{78548}{78590}No! No, you can't do that!
{78596}{78646}I'm sorry, but I have to be strong.
{78652}{78715}Give me another chance!|I have to go to Earth!
{78721}{78752}You don't have respect for me!
{78758}{78854}Sure I do, guy.|Please just hear me out.
{78915}{78994}{y:i}Some people say that I'm a bad guy
{79000}{79079}{y:i}They may be right|{y:i}They may be right
{79085}{79165}{y:i}But it's not as if I don't try
{79171}{79239}{y:i}I just fuck up, try as I might
{79245}{79296}{y:i}But I can change, I can change
{79302}{79376}{y:i}I can learn to keep my promises|{y:i}I swear it
{79382}{79423}{y:i}I'll open up my heart|{y:i}And I will share it
{79429}{79516}{y:i}Any minute now, I will be born again
{79516}{79562}{y:i}Yes I can change, I can change
{79568}{79636}{y:i}I know I've been|{y:i}A dirty little bastard
{79642}{79693}{y:i}I like to kill, I like to maim|{y:i}I'm insane, but it's okay
{79699}{79760}{y:i}'Cause I can change
{79766}{79820}{y:i}It's not my fault that I'm so evil
{79826}{79905}{y:i}It's society, society
{79911}{79965}{y:i}You see my parents|{y:i}Were sometimes abusive
{79971}{80029}{y:i}And it made a prick of me
{80035}{80080}{y:i}But I can change, I can change
{80086}{80138}{y:i}What if you remain|{y:i}A sandy little butthole
{80144}{80233}{y:i}Don't be such a twit|{y:i}Mother Teresa won't have shit on me
{80239}{80334}{y:i}Just watch me change|Here I go. I'm changing!
{80875}{80915}You see, I've really matured.
{80921}{80975}All right.
{80981}{81021}Come on, we have to hurry.
{81027}{81087}I love you.
{81145}{81201}{y:i}Ladies and gentlemen|{y:i}of the American Army...
{81207}{81285}{y:i}... welcome to the USO show.
{81291}{81356}{y:i}Get ready for loads of entertainment|{y:i}and fabulous celebrities...
{81362}{81493}{y:i}... followed immediately by|{y:i}the execution of Terrance and Phillip.
{81576}{81663}This is where those military bitches|intend to kill Terrance and Phillip.
{81669}{81688}Oh, my God!
{81694}{81745}God? He is the biggest bitch|of them all.
{81751}{81853}Hurry. We rendezvous|with the other kids at 10.
{81853}{81930}You realize we could be grounded|for two, even three weeks.
{81936}{81990}- We're willing to take that risk.|- Let's go.
{81996}{82087}{y:i}And now, here are your hosts|{y:i}for the evening, Sheila Broflovski...
{82093}{82179}{y:i}... and Big Gay Al.
{82197}{82264}Al, tonight is a very special night.|Do you know why?
{82270}{82337}They're having a sale at Merv's?
{82343}{82420}No. Because we're going|to abolish Canadian smut.
{82426}{82534}That's right, Sheila.|Bring out the condemned.
{82604}{82714}Today is a great day for democracy!
{82724}{82825}This is worse than when you put your|dick in my mouth and took a picture.
{82831}{82865}I know, Terrance. I know.
{82871}{82971}While you're getting set up over there,|let's bring out our first act:
{82977}{83073}Yippie, the back-flipping dog!
{83336}{83399}Be careful not to touch this wire.
{83405}{83451}Motherfuck...
{83457}{83530}Fuck.
{83623}{83701}The show has started.|We're running out of time.
{83707}{83733}Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
{83739}{83796}Yes, but they are heavily guarded.
{83802}{83838}Dig from here,|so as not to be seen.
{83844}{83917}Come on, bitches.
{83919}{83961}Mole, do you know where|the clitoris is?
{83967}{83993}- The what?|- The clitoris.
{83999}{84056}I have to find it,|so I can get Wendy to like me.
{84062}{84101}Stop thinking with your dick!
{84107}{84163}Be on your toes, because I won't|be grounded again!
{84169}{84213}Not for you! Not for anybody!
{84219}{84287}Men, when you're out there|in the battlefield...
{84293}{84347}...and you're looking into|the beady eyes of a Canadian...
{84353}{84418}...as he charges you with|his hockey stick or whatever he has...
{84424}{84535}...and people are dying all around you,|just remember what the MPAA says:
{84541}{84666}"Deplorable violence is okay as long as|people don't say any naughty words."
{84672}{84771}That is what this war is all about.
{84777}{84843}What?
{84860}{84923}Shit!
{84934}{84997}Move, move.
{85018}{85088}We will split up here.|Let's synchronize watches.
{85094}{85140}- We don't have watches.|- You don't?
{85146}{85193}- You didn't say anything about watches.|- What do you think this is?
{85199}{85279}TV kiddie hour where we sit around|and lick Barney the Dinosaur's pussy?
{85285}{85329}This is real life, with consequences|you take to the grave.
{85335}{85372}- We don't have watches.|- Shit!
{85378}{85406}- Did you bring the mirror?|- Got it.
{85412}{85440}- And the rope?|- Check.
{85446}{85488}- And the buttfor?|- What's a "buttfor"?
{85494}{85579}For pooping, silly.
{85582}{85671}I'll dig under the stage. With|that bedrock, I'll need more time.
{85677}{85738}Stan and Kyle, stall the show|anyway you can.
{85744}{85813}Keep that show going|until I get the prisoners.
{85819}{85862}Cartman, over there is|the electrical box.
{85868}{85930}Shut it off before I return|with Terrance and Phillip...
{85936}{85997}...or the alarm will sound|and I'll be attacked by dogs.
{86003}{86023}Got it?
{86029}{86090}You must shut off the alarms.|I fucking hate guard dogs!
{86096}{86148}I heard you,|you British piece of shit.
{86154}{86215}If anything goes wrong, make a sound|like a dying giraffe.
{86221}{86292}What's a dying giraffe sound like?
{86363}{86401}- Let's go.|- Be careful, dude.
{86407}{86470}Was my mother careful when she|stabbed me in the heart...
{86476}{86582}...with a clothes hanger,|while I was still in the womb?
{86645}{86689}Damn, that kid is fucked up.
{86695}{86735}How are those chairs coming?
{86741}{86790}Al, we're minutes away.
{86796}{86916}Super. Here is pint-sized pixie|and darling of the indie movie scene...
{86922}{86973}...Winona Ryder!
{86979}{87023}Hi, guys.
{87029}{87070}I'm super-psyched to be here today.
{87076}{87159}What you're doing for our country|is so cool.
{87165}{87245}I mean war, man. Wow, war.
{87251}{87304}You know? Wow.
{87310}{87463}Okay, and now for your enjoyment,|here's my famous Ping-Pong ball trick.
{87630}{87664}Oh, my!
{87670}{87711}"Shut off the power, Cartman."
{87717}{87766}"This is very important, Cartman."
{87772}{87876}- Did you hear what Winona Ryder's doing?|- We can't miss this.
{87944}{88093}There. I didn't miss one.|That's my Ping-Pong ball trick!
{88143}{88195}That's all the acts we have|for tonight...
{88201}{88284}...so let's just get on with|the execution!
{88290}{88343}- No, we have to stall him.|- More! More!
{88349}{88385}Yeah! More!
{88391}{88458}You big sillies.|You want to see more of me?
{88464}{88560}Yeah! Big Gay Al! Big Gay Al!
{88568}{88648}Well, I do have a little song I wrote|about the war.
{88654}{88687}But we haven't rehearsed.
{88693}{88739}Sing it!
{88745}{88768}I can't.
{88774}{88809}Sing the fucking song!
{88815}{88879}All right. If you insist,|I'll sing my song.
{88885}{88979}I believe it goes|a little bit like this.
{88996}{89044}{y:i}Bombs are flying
{89050}{89092}{y:i}People are dying
{89098}{89191}{y:i}Children are crying|{y:i}Politicians are lying too

{89867}{89932}{y:i}But I just can't feel too bad|{y:i}For you right now
{89938}{90009}{y:i}Because I'm feeling|{y:i}So insanely super
{90015}{90092}{y:i}That even the fact that you can't walk|{y:i}Can't bring me down

{91282}{91343}Son of a gun! Heck!
{91349}{91398}They're coming?

{94827}{94863}Go on, dude, tell her.
{94869}{94930}- I can't.|- You can't kill Terrance and Phillip.
{94936}{95051}If they die, Satan and Saddam Hussein|will take over the world.
{95132}{95180}Throw the switch, Mr. Garrison.
{95186}{95281}I'm supposed to be anonymous.
{95283}{95357}Goodbye, bastards!

{96835}{96889}The clitoris?|I found the clitoris!
{96895}{96998}Stan, you must not let Terrance and|Phillip's blood spill on the ground.
{97004}{97047}Tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
{97053}{97102}There are more important matters|right now.
{97108}{97191}I looked all over for you.|Tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
{97197}{97259}Dude, just have confidence in yourself.
{97265}{97322}Believe in yourself, and others|will believe in you.
{97328}{97394}Chicks love confidence.|Now go. Hurry!
{97400}{97461}The clitoris has spoken.
{97467}{97498}Stan, are you okay?
{97504}{97618}I see you failed. I should not|have sent a boy to do a man's job.
{97624}{97726}Come on!|We've got precious little time!
{97770}{97857}Die, Canadian, m'kay?

{98514}{98634}Remember, Human Shield,|protect our tanks and planes too.
{98704}{98740}Holy mother of Jehoshaphat!
{98746}{98766}Fire on my command.
{98772}{98850}All right, squad, just like I told you.

{99023}{99063}What in the...
{99069}{99095}Great plan, Chef.
{99101}{99181}Operation Human Shield, my ass!
{99217}{99267}My God, this is terrible.
{99273}{99313}This is what we wanted!
{99319}{99415}We wanted our children to be|brought up in a smut-free environment!
{99421}{99472}But we didn't want this.
{99478}{99514}Where are you going?
{99520}{99562}We're going to find our boys.
{99568}{99690}For God's sake, Sheila, we're|going to get them killed!
{99790}{99849}All those times I said|you were a big dumb Jew?
{99855}{99919}I didn't mean it. You're not a Jew.
{99925}{99977}Yes, I am! I am a Jew, Cartman!
{99983}{100045}Don't be so hard on yourself.
{100051}{100105}Why am I still holding this?
{100111}{100150}Mr. Hat! No!
{100156}{100224}Fuck this. I'm getting out|before I get in trouble.
{100230}{100275}I heard that.
{100281}{100352}I found the clitoris.|Now I can get Wendy to like me again.
{100358}{100379}Swell, Stan.
{100385}{100485}I guess all's well that ends well.|We can go home now. Dipshit.
{100491}{100514}What's wrong?
{100520}{100641}We can't let Terrance and Phillip die,|or the whole world will end.
{100647}{100671}Terrance, look!
{100677}{100697}There they are!
{100703}{100740}Phillip, we're done for!
{100746}{100794}All right, men! Fire!
{100800}{100873}Goodbye, Terrance.

{100981}{101003}Don't shoot!
{101009}{101145}I'll take care of this.|Kids, get out of the way now!
{101250}{101303}I'm not going to let you kill them, Mom!
{101309}{101332}What, what, what?
{101338}{101423}I'm not moving!
{101432}{101511}Stand down. You can still see|fart jokes on Nickelodeon.
{101517}{101570}No! This is about|more than fart jokes!
{101576}{101639}This is about freedom of speech,|about censorship...
{101645}{101690}...and stuff.
{101696}{101814}What about Ike? Did you forget|your adopted son is Canadian?
{101840}{101903}I'm doing very important things.
{101909}{101964}But you never took the time|to talk to me.
{101970}{102044}Whenever I get in trouble,|you blame everybody else.
{102050}{102107}But I'm the one to blame.|Deal with me.
{102113}{102164}You keep fighting all these causes.
{102170}{102206}But I don't want a fighter.
{102212}{102287}I want my mom.
{102345}{102416}Poor little fella!
{102518}{102544}Holy shit, dude!

{102902}{102993}It's Saddam Hussein! Shoot him!
{102995}{103053}What a dumb ass!
{103114}{103169}You have spilled|the blood of the innocent.
{103175}{103243}Now begins 2 million|years of darkness.
{103249}{103304}Good job, Ms. Broflovski.|Thanks a lot.
{103310}{103388}I was trying to make the world|a better place for children.
{103394}{103474}And you brought enough intolerance|to allow my coming.
{103480}{103585}Now, everyone bow down to me!
{103622}{103648}Bend over!
{103654}{103698}What have we done?
{103704}{103769}Saddam, I'm the dark ruler, not you.
{103775}{103850}Relax.|Better seen, not heard.
{103853}{103879}I can't.
{103885}{103940}Let's start by building|a big statue of me!
{103946}{103995}There, where that fat kid is standing.
{104001}{104093}Don't call me fat, buttfucker!
{104202}{104241}Yeah, Cartman, do it.
{104247}{104351}Damn! Shit!|Respect my fucking authority!
{104384}{104448}You need to watch your mouth, brat!
{104454}{104540}Dogshit taco!
{104608}{104642}Quick, do something.
{104648}{104702}Try this on for size.

{104835}{104983}Buddy, I know I was mean before.|But don't worry, I can change.
{105046}{105094}Not!

{105572}{105680}I have had enough of you!
{105969}{106074}He spent so much time convincing me|I was weak and stupid...
{106080}{106122}...that I believed it myself.
{106128}{106176}I have you to thank, little one.
{106182}{106242}You showed me that I had|to get away from him.
{106248}{106357}Just make any wish you want|and I shall grant it.
{106396}{106442}- Are you sure?|- What did he say?
{106448}{106551}His wish is for everything to go back|to the way it was before this war.
{106557}{106634}Kenny, you realize that means|you'd go back too.
{106640}{106703}I know.
{106869}{106895}Very well, then.
{106901}{106943}I will pull my minions back.
