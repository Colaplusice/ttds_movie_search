{1111}{1209}Promise me you won't sleep|with an Italian, baby.
{1225}{1259}Darling, what are you saying?
{1291}{1376}- Nor with an American hippie.|- No, it's disgusting!
{1386}{1440}Nor with a pretty little French guy.
{1445}{1472}Nope!
{1477}{1580}And not even with a Mexican |selling bracelets...
{1585}{1633}- ...in the Cote D'Azur.|- Oh, Tenoch.
{1638}{1736}- With nobody.|- Of course not.
{1756}{1816}- Promise me.|- I promise.
{1822}{1861}- What?|- Come on, you know!
{1867}{1906}I know what?
{1965}{1993}I promise...
{1999}{2061}...I won't even sleep...
{2067}{2095}...with a Chinese.
{2100}{2181}- I'm not joking!|- Don't you trust me, Tenoch?
{2196}{2241}- Yes.|- So what?
{2303}{2369}- Well, promise.|- And you?

{2969}{3011}- one from Sonora.|- Irish.
{3016}{3064}- Or from Guasave.|- Your father.
{3070}{3136}Are you crazy?
{3398}{3467}Ana's mother, a divorced French|woman, a teacher...
{3473}{3527}...at the Foreigners Institute...
{3533}{3621}...didn't object about Tenoch|sleeping with her daughter.
{3638}{3689}It was different for Julio.
{3694}{3824}He stayed with Cecilia until dinner,|and came back the next morning.
{3890}{4000}It wasn't noticeable, but Cecilia's|father, an allergy specialist...
{4005}{4121}...feared that her relationship with Julio|went too far beyond.
{4132}{4191}Her mother, a psychologist...
{4196}{4287}...saw it positively, |as an innocent thing.
{4292}{4392}- She can't find her passport!|- Then she's gonna miss the plane!
{4397}{4477}Julio!|Help me looking for the passport!
{4482}{4568}- Be quick, we're in a hurry!|- Yes, yes.

{5169}{5231}- What a nice greeting.|Oh, yeah!
{5269}{5292}Hey.
{5305}{5376}What are you gonna do tonight, |going to the party?
{5381}{5447}No, I'll feel lonely without you...
{5452}{5527}...I already know I'm gonna|miss you an awful lot.
{5538}{5589}- Come on!|- Cecilia!
{5594}{5640}- Your mother!|- Come, come!
{5645}{5721}I wanna take a bit of you inside me.
{5739}{5792}The plane's gonna leave you on land, honey!
{5798}{5856}Move! Move!
{5959}{5998}Found it?
{6003}{6054}- Here it is!|- Good.
{6142}{6194}How are you?
{6199}{6276}- Have you seen Esteban?|- No, I haven't.
{6311}{6376}Ana, do the check-in!
{6486}{6531}How's it going, charrolastra?
{6536}{6597}What a farewell party, huh?
{6602}{6647}Let'em go.
{6653}{6722}I'm gonna miss her, but here we are.|Bye bye.
{6728}{6792}- Hi, guys.|- Hey, how's it going?
{6797}{6839}Why are you so pale?
{6845}{6881}Nevermind.
{6910}{6986}- Wonderful!|- Hi, dad! How are you!
{7014}{7122}Ana's father was a journalist,|recently converted to politics.
{7128}{7247}He was the director of the Institute|of Culture in Mexico City.
{7265}{7308}He had a liking for Tenoch...
{7313}{7376}...but with his Party mates...
{7381}{7484}...and never in front of Ana,|he called him "the young lad".
{7489}{7558}- Let's go.|- I wish I was already there.
{7563}{7636}- Don't go.|- I'll miss you, my love.
{7641}{7706}- I don't want to leave, honey.|- Ana!
{7953}{8001}Smell of bread.
{8034}{8126}Oh, fuck! Damn hog!|Get the hell off my ass!
{8131}{8202}A gift for the promotion.|Fuck off!
{8208}{8271}Go to hell, hog!
{8278}{8356}Stop , cut it out.|Don't be a child.
{8361}{8410}Did your father get pissed?
{8415}{8471}No. He got angry.
{8476}{8566}If I don't take Economics,|I can forget the car.
{8572}{8629}Being left without "Murcigalo" ...
{8635}{8729}- only for not willing to study?|- I hate economists!
{8734}{8817}They can all go fuck themselves.
{8822}{8872}- What an idiot.|- No way.
{8877}{8968}I wanna be a writer.|Come with me at Literature.
{8974}{9031}No, I pass.
{9108}{9238}Fucking traffic! I bet |Boinas is there demonstrating.
{9252}{9303}It's her right, charrolastra.
{9308}{9405}And it's my right to tell'em|they're sons of a bitch.
{9410}{9445}True.
{9450}{9556}But there are always nice chicks at |those demonstrations, huh?
{9562}{9611}That's for sure.
{9621}{9681}Do you wear perfume?
{9759}{9830}Holy shit!|You're the hog!
{9835}{9860}Open it!
{9865}{9927}- Open it!|- There's the safe lock.
{9933}{9975}Open it, asshole!
{9992}{10097}That day, three demonstations|took place.
{10103}{10222}But the jam had been caused by|a pedestrian having been struck.
{10227}{10326}Marcelino Escutia,|an immigrant carpenter from Michoacn.
{10334}{10446}Marcelino was hit|by a truck at high speed.
{10459}{10537}He never used the pedestrian bridge...
{10542}{10649}...because it forced him to walk 2 more|km. to get to the building yard.
{10660}{10757}His unidentified body|was recovered...
{10762}{10863}and brought to the mortuary.|It was claimed 4 days later.
{10999}{11107}Tenoch was the second of three sons|of a Harvard economist...
{11112}{11176}...Subsecretary of  State...
{11186}{11316}...and of a housewife attending|esoteric courses and activities.
{11321}{11418}They decided to name Tenoch|"Hernn"...
{11423}{11496}...but then his father took|a job for the government...
{11501}{11551}and hit by nationalism...
{11556}{11615}...he named his son "Tenoch",|an Aztec name.
{11634}{11704}I'll roll this joint and we're off.
{11709}{11826}I've brought some stuff|from San Francisco. It's a charm!
{11846}{11900}- Uncut pills.|- Really?
{11905}{11942}Go with the trip!
{11947}{12053}If I see Miriam I'll bite her tits|and fuck her hung by her ears!
{12074}{12116}- What a chick!|- Hell, yeah!
{12147}{12277}She rubbed herself on me|at Rata's party.
{12283}{12336}Really, what a slut!
{12369}{12422}I wanna make Sazn's woman.
{12427}{12481}What an ass and what tits!
{12537}{12615}Yeah, Sazn's woman|is outstanding.
{12620}{12696}Oh, not here, assshole. On the terrace!
{12702}{12763}- The smell is the same.|- It stinks, dude!
{12914}{12991}- Nicely damp, isn't it?|- Don't be an asshole.
{13012}{13061}- Dry.|- Of course.
{13089}{13127}Monkey stuff.
{13133}{13169}A strong joint.
{13194}{13221}Tenoch!
{13241}{13266}My mother.
{13272}{13338}- Hello, madam. How are you?|- Hi, Julio.
{13344}{13385}- Hi, mom.|- Honey!
{13411}{13501}What's up, kids?|You look weird.
{13508}{13538}Are you a bit sad?
{13552}{13616}It's for the girls, right?
{13631}{13715}Come on, boys!|Love has upset you all!
{13720}{13792}Think of them, and you'll be with them.
{13798}{13889}- Are you coming at Jessica's wedding?|- How could I miss.
{13915}{14021}You'll have to dress elegantly.|There will be the president, too.
{14027}{14081}Tenoch, throw that cigarette.
{14087}{14177}Hello, madam.|Your garden rocks.
{14183}{14291}- Saba, I didn't know you were here, too.|- I'm everywhere.
{14362}{14441}At the party, Julio and Tenoch |used alcohol and marijuana...
{14446}{14511}...and the ecstasy from San Francisco.
{14517}{14592}Their conquering plans failed.
{14598}{14701}They were afraid that their failure|could mark their summer destiny.
{14722}{14787}At 4 AM|Julio threw up on the road.
{14792}{14904}At 5, Tenoch broke a car's lamp|going back home...
{14909}{14936}The same night...
{14943}{15045}...Saba had his first group sex |experience.
{15206}{15235}A week passed by
{15240}{15314}For Julio and Tenoch,|boredom became routine.
{15320}{15411}Tenoch's father was a shareholder|of a sporting club...
{15417}{15539}...so his son could get in |on monday, the closing day.
{15692}{15765}One, two, three.
{16790}{16900}You were breathless 'cause|you had just smoked.
{16905}{16935}The pro.
{16940}{16989}You only gave me two meters.
{16994}{17041}10 at least, asshole.
{17048}{17131}- Four, at best.|- Two and a half.
{17137}{17178}You always exaggerate.
{17223}{17307}Hey, I don't want to exaggerate, but...
{17313}{17381}...you got a really ugly cock
{17403}{17470}It looks like a hooded monk...
{17496}{17565}Then get on your knees. Confess yourself!
{17572}{17615}Don't be a queer!
{17798}{17849}Six, seven...
{17854}{17922}...eight, nine, ten, eleven.
{17929}{18000}- More bodyguards than guests.|- Count them.
{18005}{18069}3 for the Comonforts,|3 for the Guerreros.
{18075}{18106}Don't point.
{18111}{18191}My father's boss got two, |like that government guy.
{18197}{18279}- Plus all the Major State.|- Add Herminio, won't you?
{18285}{18361}- No, he's my driver.|- But he's armed.
{18415}{18509}Looks like our Tenoch|is pretty drunk.
{18514}{18567}Dad, I've greeted the president.
{18573}{18660}The Gonzales Bocanegras are looking for you.|Please, behave with them.
{18665}{18743}They've always been so nice with you.
{18749}{18783}All right, dad.
{18802}{18864}Do you remember the fatty girl?
{18881}{18910}How are you?
{18915}{18963}It's been a century!
{18968}{19002}You see?
{19050}{19096}What are you doing?
{19144}{19193}What a bunch of assholes, huh?
{19198}{19254}- As you say, sir.|- Hey, buddy.
{19259}{19341}Do me a Mil lslas.|Pretty loaded.
{19523}{19609}Do you remember your cousin, Tenoch?|He wants to be a writer, too.
{19614}{19695}You'll have a lot of things to tell.
{19700}{19766}- Cheers.|- Cheers, aunt. Thanks.
{19799}{19848}- What a lady, huh?|- Yes.
{19853}{19934}How are you, baby?|The last time, you were a child...
{19939}{19997}...crying for the Ninja Turtles.
{20002}{20078}- It was a ThunderCat.|- Sorry, a ThunderCat.
{20084}{20185}So you want to tell stories|about children?
{20190}{20241}No, stories about morons like you.
{20246}{20357}Writing in high school is one thing,|literature is another one.
{20362}{20416}- When are you starting?|- Did you read my book?
{20421}{20506}- I've read the critics.|- Critics are all assholes!
{20517}{20626}Alejandro Montes de Oca, "Jano",|was Tenoch's cousin.
{20633}{20761}His father died when he was 3.|He was committed to his aunt.
{20767}{20856}He managed to escape abroad |with a master course.
{20862}{20939}He had just returned after 10 years.
{20944}{21035}Think well.|Do you really want to be a writer?
{21040}{21106}It's full of writers,|but the good ones are few.
{21111}{21176}It takes a life to become one.
{21188}{21232}My cousin, the writer.
{21237}{21328}It's not just discipline|and improving your technique.
{21334}{21458}No, you need a personal style, too.|You must have lived a lot.
{21473}{21558}Let's be honest,|What have you lived?
{21563}{21641}Yes, Tenoch, what experience do you have?
{21653}{21695}Fuck, guys!
{21702}{21751}Sorry, sorry.
{21764}{21789}Are you all right?
{21901}{21933}I wish...
{21938}{21983}...to thank you all...
{21990}{22065}...for your presence|at this humble celebration.
{22091}{22132}And especially...
{22137}{22226}...the president of the republic|and his charming lady...
{22233}{22296}...who have shared with us...
{22301}{22389}...this important moment|for Jessica and Francisco...
{22395}{22466}...in spite of their duties.
{22472}{22512}It's really...
{22535}{22606}a sensitive act.
{22627}{22729}In front of such illustrious guests...
{22735}{22829}...I want to wish the newly weds|the most absolute happiness.
{22888}{22941}Damn, what a beauty.
{22967}{22991}Hello.
{22998}{23046}- Pleased to meet you.|- Hi.
{23064}{23106}- Hello.|- Hi.
{23119}{23187}- Aren't you bored of this all?|- No.

{23744}{23874}Luisa Corts was left an orphan|when 10 because of a car accident.
{23898}{23952}She was grown by her grand-aunt...
{23957}{24051}...a franchist who fell sick |and was taken care of by Luisa
{24056}{24112}in her last 5 years of life.
{24118}{24218}Luisa always lived with her.|At 20 she married Jano.
{24237}{24342}Months later, the grand-aunt died,|and Luisa lost her last relative.
{24348}{24420}- What happened?|- Those assholes.
{24426}{24496}How can I introduce you |to the president?
{24502}{24551}Let's do it another time.
{24557}{24591}- No, let's go.|- With a bit of salt...
{24600}{24657}- Salt.|- Let's look for another suit.
{24675}{24746}- Jano, don't do this to me.|- Attention.
{24751}{24826}- Take care of my mother.|- Hey.
{24831}{24873}Is he your husband?
{24879}{24953}- Yes, why?|- He's my cousin.
{24958}{24984}His cousin.
{24989}{25046}- What's your name?|- Me? Tenoch.
{25052}{25078}- Tenoch?|- Yes.
{25087}{25141}Tenoch, the little dwarf?
{25155}{25214}I saw you before getting married.
{25220}{25249}You were a little puppy.
{25255}{25314}You wanted a Thundercat.
{25319}{25366}Good memory.
{25377}{25422}- Do you smoke?|- Thanks.
{25428}{25502}- You're pretty grown up.|- Thanks.
{25508}{25601}When did you arrive?
{25606}{25641}Almost a month ago.
{25646}{25741}Jano will keep lessons at the university.|From September.
{25747}{25799}Are you going on holiday?
{25805}{25876}He's going to Villahermosa|with other scholars.
{25881}{25967}- I stay doing job colloquies.|- Sure.
{25972}{26066}If there's time, I'd like to go to the sea.|And you?
{26071}{26156}- We are going to the sea.|- In Puerto Escondido?
{26161}{26258}- Jano talked to me a lot about it.|- Puerto? No, it sucks.
{26273}{26298}Isn't it a beautiful place?
{26303}{26391}Only hip guys and 4th rate |surfers go there.
{26396}{26492}There are only fishermen|where we go.
{26551}{26596}And what's its name?
{26601}{26671}- Mouth... What's its name?|- Heaven's Mouth.
{26720}{26769}Heaven's Mouth, sure.
{26782}{26828}- It's wonderful!|- A paradise!
{26833}{26904}Practically heaven |made sea.
{26909}{26944}Tropical.
{26966}{27037}A bite of heaven, on earth.
{27042}{27106}A paradise on earth, |with roots...
{27112}{27197}- You could come with us|Yeah, come with us!
{27202}{27227}Me?
{27232}{27276}- Would you take me with you?|- Heck, sure.
{27281}{27350}- Of course.|- Is there room to sleep?
{27355}{27432}Yes, on a bed of sand,|warm and smooth...
{27437}{27512}- ...under a starry sky.|- In luxury.
{27518}{27618}There's coconut there, |and then we carry some cagumas.
{27631}{27691}- Cagumas?|- Beer.
{27700}{27756}Jano will like it.
{27794}{27836}The mariachis.
{28098}{28195}The president left one hour later.|He had a meeting...
{28200}{28331}...with the Executive Committee|for the electoral candidates choice.
{28347}{28393}The next morning, at 10...
{28398}{28477}He shown disappointment|for the Cerro Verde massacre...
{28482}{28581}...denying that the governor of |the state knew anything about it.
{28591}{28665}After expressing his condolences...
{28671}{28783}...he flew to Seattle for a world |summit on globalization.
{28824}{28900}The days passed by, and while Jano|was away because of his meeting...
{28908}{29004}...Luisa got some test results |from her doctor.
{29009}{29097}In the waiting room, she took a test|on a magazine, named:
{29103}{29161}"Are you a satisfied woman?"
{29166}{29265}In the first question, Luisa picked|answer B:
{29277}{29374}"I prefer to be awake rather |than sleeping and dreaming".
{29379}{29409}In the 4th, C:
{29421}{29511}"I value time|more than power or money".
{29516}{29558}In the 7th, A:
{29564}{29663}"I think about today |rather than yesterday or tomorrow".
{29669}{29716}She scored 16 points.
{29722}{29844}The magazine found her |afraid to claim her freedom.
{29850}{29890}Luisa didn't agree.
{29965}{30064}Think about Conchita's tits.|Those stiff and hard nipples.
{30070}{30113}Excellent.
{30119}{30187}And Mayela's pussy?
{30193}{30271}All wet and hairy.
{30276}{30338}- Your girlfriend's mother.|- Shut up.
{30344}{30398}The 2nd grade teacher?
{30405}{30512}- Yes, Mrs. Georgina.|- She turned me on.
{30518}{30619}- Salma Hayek!|- Yeah, Salmita!
{30625}{30719}- Hey, your cousin.|- What cousin?

{30762}{30806}The Spanish one!
{31331}{31371}Yes?
{31396}{31434}Hello?
{31439}{31503}- Honey?|- Jano.
{31566}{31616}Are you fine?
{31669}{31736}It's just that...
{31752}{31801}I'm drunk, Luisa.
{31807}{31876}Then go to sleep.|We'll talk tomorrow.
{31881}{31934}I'll be back in two days.
{31940}{32048}- I love you an awful lot..|- Me too, Jano.
{32054}{32156}I'm an idiot.|I swear. I'm crap.
{32190}{32236}You're drunk. Sleep.
{32242}{32306}I'm an asshole.|A piece of shit.
{32312}{32401}Calm down.|What's wrong?
{32406}{32454}- Are you fine, honey?|- It's just that...
{32460}{32501}It's just that...
{32514}{32566}...I've slept with a woman.
{32655}{32731}Can you see I'm crap?
{32772}{32816}Luisa?
{32867}{32917}Why are you telling me this?
{32923}{32991}I love you an awful lot!
{32996}{33057}Why are you telling me this?
{34655}{34707}Here's your sandwich, darling.
{34712}{34792}- With your favorite cheese.|- Thanks.
{34828}{34861}Hello?
{34868}{34919}One moment, please.
{34925}{34971}It's for you, Tenoch.
{35106}{35132}Who is it?
{35137}{35191}I'm Luisa.
{35209}{35266}The Spanish.
{35271}{35343}Oh, hello! How are you?
{35349}{35438}I'm glad I've found you.|You said you were leaving today.
{35444}{35531}- To go where?|- To Heaven's Mouth, right?
{35546}{35609}Yes, we're leaving today.
{35617}{35738}- Are you ready yet?|- Well, we're sorting things out.
{35744}{35794}- Listen, a question...|- What?
{35858}{35926}Is your invitation still valid?
{35942}{35981}Hello?
{35986}{36035}- Well...|- I guess it isn't.
{36042}{36125}- It's ok, nevermind.|- Wait. Yes, yes.
{36130}{36241}- Nevermind, I don't want to bother.|- No, it's fine.
{36246}{36325}Where shall we pick you?
{36330}{36447}I live in Calle Machu Picchu, at 52.|Third floor, intern C, like cheese.
{36642}{36668}Hello?
{36674}{36731}Are you sleeping, fucking lazy-bones?
{36750}{36861}I've been awake 'till 3|watching tapes.
{36866}{36946}- Hurry up, we're going to the beach.|- What?
{36951}{37009}To Heaven's Mouth.
{37015}{37112}- But it doesn't exist.|- I know, but Luisa wants to go there.
{37118}{37176}- What Luisa?|- Luisa.
{37182}{37286}- Are you joking? Really?|- Really. Fetch Betsab.
{37292}{37408}It won't make it.|The radiator and the battery are screwed.
{37413}{37501}And it's my sister's turn to use it.|Let's go with Murcigalo.
{37507}{37602}My father took it off me|because of the broken lamp.
{37608}{37655}What an asshole.
{37662}{37738}Julio Zapata lived with |his mother and his sister.
{37744}{37847}He hadn't seen his father |since when he was 5.
{37853}{37983}His mother had always been|a secretary in a corporation.
{38051}{38131}His sister Manuela,|known as "Boinas"...
{38137}{38267}...studied Political Sciences|At the National University.
{38272}{38386}After a long negotiation,|Julio had the car for 5 days...
{38395}{38442}...in exchange for 3 weeks...
{38448}{38572}...during which  Boinas would go |to Chiapas to distribute provisions.
{38647}{38701}- Beer!|- Beer, beer, beer.
{38706}{38743}Here's the beer.
{38763}{38813}One, two..
{38819}{38861}For three!
{38877}{38921}Condoms!
{38934}{39000}- Aren't there any of your size?|- It's the men's sector.
{39068}{39111}Beware, dude.
{39141}{39219}After Puebla, get off the highway.
{39225}{39321}- The landscape is a real riot.|- Yeah, that way.
{39327}{39419}Then, once you're here, go this way.|Damn.
{39425}{39487}Saba, you fool, that's a river!
{39493}{39572}You're going towards  Veracruz!
{39578}{39626}No, towards Oaxaca.
{39632}{39677}Quiet, then you go this way...
{39683}{39769}Careful, right?|There are traffic control posts.
{39774}{39864}If you got weed stuff it|In your balls, understood?
{39870}{39961}- Saba, we're in a hurry.|- Yes, be quick.
{40008}{40091}Then you get to this small village...
{40097}{40186}...there's a hut with a giant|Coca-Cola bottle on the top.
{40192}{40261}- Saba, and then what?|- Yeah, then?
{40267}{40311}What?
{40334}{40402}- The beach, ugly fool!|- Yeah, the beach.
{40408}{40524}Turn left on a country lane,|and you're on the beach.
{40530}{40575}That's all.
{40876}{40901}Yes?
{40924}{40976}I'll come down immediately.
{42147}{42196}Give it to me, I'll help you.
{43087}{43146}Be quiet, it's my car.
{43207}{43303}- You haven't told us what you do for a living.|- What do you think?
{43308}{43351}- A sociologist.|- Cold.
{43362}{43405}Philosopher?
{43410}{43439}No, cold.
{43450}{43501}- Psychologist.|- Really?
{43506}{43572}- Lingerie model.|- Frost!
{43578}{43614}We surrender.
{43620}{43681}I have a degree in odontology.
{43686}{43788}- What's that?|- she dries your drooling, at the dentist.
{43793}{43833} -Really?|- Really?
{43841}{43904}- Why such a choice?|- I didn't make it.
{43910}{43957}I never played with dolls...
{43963}{44040}...or pretended to be a dentist.
{44045}{44183}- Why then?|- I was 16, my aunt fell sick...
{44189}{44243}...and I had to find a job.
{44249}{44301}4 months later I had a degree.
{44307}{44424}- But did you want to do something else before?|- I didn't do well at school.
{44430}{44488}I had a fixed idea:
{44494}{44597}I wanted to travel.
{44603}{44709}- Travelling is super cool.|- Eh, yes.
{44716}{44804}- You've never been on a plane!|- What do you mean?
{44810}{44865}- Well, only three planes.|- So what?
{44870}{44931}And so I would be a philosopher?
{44937}{45051}- You look like someone who thinks.|- Of course, you're Jano's wife.
{45068}{45184}Luisa often attended to intellectuals'|dinners with Jano.
{45190}{45256}She never integrated herself with them.
{45261}{45341}There was always someone |willing to involve her...
{45346}{45381}...or expose her...
{45387}{45457}...giving her the word|in the middle of a discussion.
{45463}{45524}Humbly, she used to answer:
{45529}{45594}"I don't know anything about these things".
{45613}{45691}Sometimes, she would have wanted|to ask them...
{45696}{45793}...to list the names of all the teeth|one by one.
{45802}{45836}She never did it.
{45932}{45991}Charrolastra, pass me the chips.
{45997}{46026}What's charro...
{46032}{46087}- Charrolastra?|- Yes. What's it?
{46092}{46160}A mix of charol astrale|and charro lastre.
{46165}{46194}- Cool, isn't it?|- Very.
{46199}{46303}Daniel didn't know the words|of an english song and used to sing:
{46309}{46365}Charrolastra, charrolo
{46392}{46444}Charrolastra, charrolo
{46458}{46491}According to Saba...
{46496}{46581}...it refers to the dead weight|we are for your father.
{46586}{46672}So Daniel and Saba are|charrolastras, too?
{46677}{46754}Lately Saba|has been taken by the investigation of...
{46759}{46834}...the altered states|of his expanded conscience.
{46839}{46897}- In a mystical phase?|- No, dope.
{46903}{46990}- He's out of mind.|- We see Daniel less and less.
{46995}{47109}- Every day he's more queer.|- Is that why you don't see him?
{47114}{47215}He wants to frequent different companies.|But we're still brothers.
{47238}{47309}Pecas is just a honorary member...
{47314}{47380}...because she has terrible boyfriends.
{47385}{47476}- She didn't sign our manifesto.|- Manifesto?
{47487}{47517}Tell me something.
{47522}{47559}- No.|- It's secret.
{47564}{47661}- I won't tell anyone.|- We'd be forced to kill you.
{47668}{47762}One: there's no greater honor |than being a charrolastra.
{47768}{47834}Two: to each his own.
{47840}{47890}Three: pop killed the poetry.
{47895}{47986}- Four: a joint a day.|- Saba's idea.
{47992}{48056}Five: don't fuck with the others' girlfriends.
{48061}{48165}Six: America's supporters are queers.|- Seven: death to the morals.
{48170}{48222}Eight: forbidden to get married as a virgin.
{48228}{48305}- Nine: Club America's supporters...|- You've already said that.
{48311}{48374}It's repeated because|they're queers twice.
{48379}{48421}Crappy team.
{48426}{48490}Ten: the truth is cool|but unreachable.
{48495}{48581}The truth is the best,|but it's very hard to reach.
{48587}{48693}Eleven: whoever breaks one of the rules|previously stated...
{48699}{48829}...loses his title of|charrolastra.
{48837}{48956}Take your manifesto to the parliament|and it will be a success.
{48962}{48989}But it's cool, isn't it?
{48994}{49058}Don't the charrolastras eat?
{49064}{49146}Julio and Tenoch told her |many other tales.
{49152}{49225}Each story proved |the strong ties
{49230}{49335}...that joined them,|they were like one.
{49340}{49470}The stories, although enriched |with personal mythology, were true.
{49487}{49583}But like it always happens,|they were incomplete truths.
{49589}{49701}Julio didn't say that he used to light matches|to cover the smell in the toilet
{49707}{49765}...in Tenoch's house...
{49770}{49894}...nor Tenoch revealed that he used to lift |the toilet cover with his foot at Julio's.
{49899}{49980}There was no need to know|those details.
{50036}{50101}- Do you have girlfriends?|- Yes, Ceci.
{50107}{50163}- Ana Bananas.|- Bananas?
{50169}{50196}And where are them?
{50202}{50275}In Europe.|They're thick as thieves.
{50281}{50366}- Where in Europe?|- Around Italy.
{50371}{50410}They're lucky.
{50415}{50495}- They say it's wonderful.|- Yes, but that's not why.
{50500}{50563}- Why?|- Why did they go to Italy?
{50569}{50610}- For the clothes?|- On holiday?
{50615}{50695}For the guys!|Italian guys are hot!
{50700}{50789}- What are you saying? You don't know them.|- Right.
{50794}{50860}Ceci wouldn't be able to betray me.
{50865}{50938}She wanted to tattoo my name |on her tit.
{50944}{51032}- But her mother didn't want her to.|- I took Ana's cherry.
{51037}{51086}- She only does it with me.|- Exactly.
{51092}{51143}I'm pleased.
{51148}{51260}Your girlfriends are lucky for having|boyfriends like you.
{51265}{51358}And are you charrolastras faithful?|- Of course.
{51364}{51395}That's how it gotta be.
{51400}{51471}Have you ever betrayed Jano?
{51477}{51553}Me? Betraying Jano?|No, I'd never do that.
{51559}{51625}- I'm so hungry...|- Here comes the lady.
{51630}{51695}Has he ever betrayed you?
{51730}{51815}Jano always needed confirmations.
{51821}{51851}Do you think so?
{51857}{51906}- Has he betrayed you?|- Some beer.
{51912}{51980}- Me too.|- Where did you meet him?
{51985}{52033}- In a bar in Madrid.|- Really?
{52038}{52123}I bet he was drunk.
{52128}{52241}No, he was sober.|I was the totally drunk one.
{52247}{52295}- Really?|- Yep.
{52305}{52355}- And then?|- And then?
{52361}{52470}This guy, so arrogant and bold...
{52476}{52516}...comes to me and goes:
{52521}{52635}- "Hey, what a chick you are! "|- What did you see in him?
{52640}{52705}Really, what did you see?
{52711}{52808}Well, I don't know.|Jano and me share a lot of things.
{52814}{52855}Like?
{52860}{52910}Well...
{52915}{53010}He has no father and I'm an orphan
{53021}{53080}His mother was annoying...
{53085}{53175}...like the aunt I used to live with.
{53180}{53286}Those 5 years when I took care|of her were terrible.
{53291}{53401}Jano was the only one |to be on my side.
{53407}{53475}- Shall we toast?|- Sure!
{53481}{53536}To relax.
{53582}{53656}- So what will you have?|- I don't know.
{54330}{54391}Thanks. Good night.
{54397}{54440}Good night.
{54580}{54658}- Hey, pal!|- The small one for you.
{54664}{54745}- Easy, huh?|- Fuck, yes.
{54750}{54776}- Hey.|- What's up?
{54782}{54853}Will Ana and Ceci make|some Italians?
{54859}{54966}- No, what are you saying?|- Ah, it's full of pee here.
{54972}{55040}- No, huh?|- Absolutely not.
{55045}{55102}And then Italians are queers.
{55107}{55145}Sure.
{55184}{55256}D'ya think the little cousin's gonna screw us?
{55261}{55365}- Looks like Jano cheats on her.|- Heavy stuff, huh?
{55380}{55501}We gotta comfort her.|Make her smile a bit.
{55507}{55533}I'll show you.
{55538}{55585}Come.
{56333}{56380}Hi guys.
{56396}{56435}I'm coming.
{56455}{56518}- What's up?|- Are you awake?
{56524}{56617}Come on, the beach'll run away!
{56622}{56710}- Fuck, come on!|- Julio, the beach.
{56761}{56797}Now?
{56865}{56938}- The after-breakfast, cool.|- Go this way.
{56944}{57020}- Can you drive like that?|- Yes.
{57056}{57112}You don't feel bends.
{57213}{57275}We fly like the Concorde.
{57328}{57410}Monkey shit.|Pure shit.
{57416}{57504}- Good stuff.|- Sure.
{57600}{57637}Good.
{57643}{57700}- D'you smoke a lot?|- So and so. You?
{57705}{57775}- No.|- Want a beer?
{57819}{57893}Tenoch didn't know Tepelmeme...
{57898}{57993}...birthplace of Leodegaria|Victoria, Leo, his nanny.
{57999}{58075}At 13 she had moved to|Mexico City.
{58094}{58224}Leo found a job at lturbide's house,|and took care of Tenoch since his birth.
{58244}{58315}Until he was 4 years old,|he called her "mom".
{58334}{58394}Tenoch didn't comment.
{58437}{58505}There's something for everyone.
{58527}{58570}I saw you tonight.
{58575}{58607}- What?|- What?
{58622}{58690}- You know what I'm talking about.|- No, about what?
{58750}{58839}D'you think you're supposed to spy |on a woman in a hotel?
{58845}{58895}It was his idea.
{58910}{58938}Ah, yes?
{58965}{59021}And you followed him.
{59027}{59095}- Did you want to see me naked?|- No.
{59101}{59215}- And get a good hand-job.|- Come on.
{59248}{59320}Tell me one thing:
{59327}{59420}Did you make love with|many other women?
{59426}{59476}- Some.|- Stop it, you boaster.
{59482}{59581}- What.|- He's only fucked with his girlfriend.
{59587}{59663}- See that you're wrong.|- With whom then?
{59669}{59763}- With Flavia.|- Fuck off! Never.
{59769}{59870}The idiot came while |he was still putting the condom on.
{59875}{59910}- You told me.|- What?
{59916}{59983}A little offer for the queen?
{59989}{60018}And you, Tenoch?
{60024}{60100}- What?|- Have you made love with others...
{60105}{60163}...apart from your girlfriend?|- Some.
{60169}{60235}- Yes, 2 or three hookers.|- Hookers?
{60240}{60313}- Whores.|- Really? Do you go with whores?
{60319}{60381}The little queen is gorgeous.
{60387}{60450}- I don't go with whores.|- You do.
{60456}{60510}- You're a whore-chaser.|- No.
{60516}{60590}- Goodbye!|- Goodbye!
{60609}{60673}- Wonderful!|- Turn it up!
{60845}{60935}Did you fuck many guys |before Jano?
{60941}{61020}I started late |and met Jano soon.
{61028}{61128}- Were you a virgin?|- A virgin? No.
{61134}{61175}There was a guy before.
{61181}{61280}Did he bang you hard? Tell us the truth, |and go, go, go!
{61285}{61360}To be honest, yes.
{61370}{61476}He took me to the factory where|his uncle worked.
{61490}{61568}I was dying with fear, |I barely knew him.
{61574}{61662}I thought he wanted to kiss me.|No, instead...
{61667}{61720}...he took my cherry.
{61725}{61795}- The bastard.|- He hurt me a real lot.
{61800}{61865}I said "I won't do it again".
{61870}{61985}But we always ended up doing it |in a row.
{61991}{62095}I thought he only wanted to screw.
{62101}{62173}But he also wanted to talk.
{62179}{62230}- He fell in love with me.|- Sure...
{62236}{62313}He used to pick me up on his bike...
{62319}{62379}...in a leather jacket.
{62384}{62456}He was fascinating. I was charmed.
{62462}{62510}I always played hooky any time I could.
{62515}{62555}Playing hooker, like doing blow jobs and stuff?
{62560}{62610}Yes, that, too.
{62616}{62691}No,playing hooky means|cutting school classes.
{62697}{62810}I used to cut classes |to spend more time with him...
{62815}{62915}...in the park, or to take |a good ride on his bike.
{62920}{63010}We were even about to go to |the Cote D'Azur.
{63016}{63050}Me too.
{63056}{63145}A friend of his had found me a job|as a waitress.
{63150}{63215}We had everything packed and ready.
{63221}{63333}He had a pigtail|and a broken tooth.
{63339}{63411}And an earring on the right.
{63416}{63490}I was in love with him, I swear.
{63508}{63560}Deeply in love.
{63573}{63661}- Then Jano came, right?|- No.
{63667}{63754}- So what?|- Dead in a bike accident.
{63777}{63815}Heck.
{63824}{63880}He was 17.
{63988}{64065}Had they passed by there|10 years earlier...
{64070}{64165}...they would have ran across a couple|of cages in the middle of the road.
{64190}{64287}Then across a cloud of white feathers.
{64293}{64408}Shortly after, more crushed cages,|with dying chickens.
{64414}{64463}
{64469}{64570}Later on, an overturned truck, |surrounded with smoke.
{64598}{64695}They'd have seen two inert bodies|on the ground...
{64700}{64785}...the smaller one covered with |a jacket...
{64791}{64870}...and a hopeless woman|crying on his side.
{65352}{65410}Another cigarette.
{66024}{66105}- Nice song, dude.|- The battery is down.
{66149}{66211}Turn on the radio.
{66243}{66276}Shit.
{66282}{66355}- Hide all the stuff.|- Don't worry.
{66360}{66430}- Calm.|- Don't stare at them.
{66436}{66533}Damn, those are fucked.
{66539}{66595}Don't look, pal.
{67472}{67525}What the hell's going on, dude?
{67587}{67660}Hey, not a bad crotch.
{67666}{67730}That woke up both of you.
{67748}{67793}Must have been the heat?
{67814}{67893}- Got a hard-on, sucked?|- You don't know how much.
{67899}{67976}- He's got a super small one.|- Small, dork?
{67982}{68066}Teodoro is 5 millimeters shorter |than your Rasputin.
{68071}{68115}Bullshit.
{68121}{68156}- Did you measure them?|- Yes.
{68162}{68225}- But his one is horrible?|- How horrible?
{68231}{68278}- Hooded.|- Come on.
{68284}{68358}- Ah! So beautiful!|- What?
{68364}{68440}- Seen?|- It sucks, it's disgusting.
{68568}{68635}How do you make love with them?
{68640}{68740}- Sweetly, with feeling.|- Yeah, with jiribilla.
{68746}{68791}With what?
{68811}{68880}With affection.
{68885}{69009}- What do you exactly do to them?|- First, some groping warms the oven.
{69030}{69160}Some kisses on her titties and|some nibbles on her nipples.
{69167}{69221}And then?
{69227}{69307}- Then I stick it all in.|- With jiribilla.
{69312}{69353}And then?
{69359}{69435}I push 'till she's dying.
{69441}{69491}- Nothing else?|- What do you mean?
{69496}{69590}Ceci waves, shakes, moans,|like an oyster with lemon.
{69596}{69661}- Ana cries.|- Oh, poor darling.
{69666}{69731}- No, she cries with pleasure.|- I figure it.
{69737}{69855}- Do you do it missionary style?|- Missionary, doggy-style, everything.
{69861}{69986}Ana likes to be on top.|And sitting, too.
{69992}{70068}And a good 69, as well.|All the Kamasutra.
{70074}{70150}All of it?|- I do everything.
{70156}{70271}And what about that thing when|you put a finger in...
{70277}{70345}- ...in the ass?|- In the ass? Oh, fuck!
{70484}{70565}Go get some water!|Some water!
{71085}{71160}- I told ya.|- Towards San Rafael.
{71165}{71282}- And how much does it take?|- It'll be ready tomorrow.
{71288}{71336}No, but thanks anyway.
{71341}{71433}- Nice sombrero.|- Yes, really nice.
{71439}{71493}You can keep it.
{71498}{71528}- Really?|- Yes.
{71533}{71565}- Is it a gift?|- Yes.
{71600}{71645}Thanks.
{71660}{71712}It looks good on me.
{71769}{71815}Here's the coconut.
{71977}{72040}- Thanks.|- Sorry.
{72697}{72751}That's my name.
{72770}{72880}Beautiful name, Luisita.
{72940}{73032}Hi, Jano.|I know you're not back yet.
{73038}{73150}I'm calling cause I didn't leave any |messages, not to make you worry.
{73176}{73263}I wanted to disappear from your life...
{73269}{73331}...but I've understood|it's not right.
{73337}{73455}This is my message, but|actually, I don't know what to say.
{73470}{73547}I've met |Lady Martina.
{73553}{73660}She's 98 and she remembers everything|since when she was 5.
{73666}{73735}Imagine all she has lived...
{73758}{73824}and what we don't live.
{73885}{73962}The mousse your mother sent us|is in the fridge.
{73968}{74067}Pay the phone bill.|It's on the desk.
{74073}{74138}Pick up your shirts from the laundry.
{74144}{74235}Careful, don't wrinkle them.
{74262}{74337}Well, take care.
{74480}{74520}See you.
{74691}{74750}Pass me the shampoo.
{74774}{74820}Shampoo!
{74827}{74870}Please.
{75386}{75455}- Oh, I'm sorry.|- No, you can come in.
{75494}{75545}- Are you all right?|- Yes.
{75551}{75652}Must have been the heat, |the trip, everything.
{75658}{75740}We wanted to ask you if you have|some shampoo.
{75755}{75790}Did you bring it?
{75934}{75980}Take the towel off.
{75998}{76035}What?
{76065}{76125}I say take the towel off.
{76140}{76220}- The towel?|- Yes, the towel.
{76285}{76340}Take it off, Tenoch.
{76418}{76463}Don't cover yourself.
{76469}{76520}Don't cover yourself.
{76537}{76640}- You're easily turned on, eh?|- Yeah, huh?
{76690}{76750}It's on the left, you've lied to me.
{76759}{76880}- What?|- You said it hung on the right.
{76900}{76980}- Oh, yeah.|- I imagined it that way, you know.
{77014}{77065}Jerk off.
{77086}{77125}Jerk off?
{77132}{77210}- A hand job. Touch yourself.|- No.
{77221}{77270}Do you want me to help you?
{77299}{77385}Do you want me to show you my tits?
{77432}{77505}I'll show them if you touch yourself.
{77591}{77641}Come here, Tenoch.
{77702}{77755}Closer.
{78347}{78429}I'm wet. Wanna feel it?
{78434}{78471}- Yes.|- Touch me.
{78477}{78515}Touch me.
{78660}{78735}Lick me, Tenoch, lick me.
{78857}{78960}- But take my panties off.|- Sure, sure.
{79175}{79221}No, come here.
{79896}{79945}Oh, honey.
{79955}{80000}Honey.
{80112}{80195}- I'm sorry.|- It's fine, it doesn't matter.
{80203}{80240}Relax.
{80705}{80818}Julio didn't know what he felt.|He only knew it wasn't anger.
{80824}{80937}He was 8 years old the|last time he had felt that way.
{80943}{81006}One night he had gone out drinking
{81012}{81130}...and had found his mother in|his godfather's arms.
{81149}{81225}Julio had retired in silence...
{81230}{81310}...and never told anyone about it.
{81516}{81555}How ware you, pal?
{81567}{81592}I'm here.
{81597}{81663}What about a little challenge?
{81669}{81770}- No, it's all full of leaves.|- No problem.
{81900}{81928}Okay.
{83025}{83080}You've let me beat you.
{83192}{83250}You had no reason.
{83271}{83312}I made Ana.
{83328}{83370}What?
{83414}{83485}You've heard me.|I made your girlfriend.
{83546}{83670}The last time Tenoch had felt like that|he was 11.
{83675}{83766}He head noticed his father's picture |on a newspaper accusing him...
{83771}{83888}...of a fraud in the import of |spoiled corn for the poor.
{83894}{84008}Tenoch and his parents moved |to Vancouver for eight moths.
{84022}{84095}Tenoch never asked the reason.
{84386}{84457}Luisa didn't know about |Julio's confession.
{84462}{84575}During dinner, though, she felt|the tension between the two friends.
{84581}{84646}She sensed the broken equilibrium...
{84651}{84706}...that she had to reestablish.
{84712}{84770}- Good night.|- Good night.
{84857}{84905}Good night, Tenoch.
{85214}{85260}What's up?
{85265}{85335}- Don't you sleep with Luisa?|- Fuck off.
{85960}{86016}How many times did you make her?
{86022}{86094}Only one, and I was drunk.
{86099}{86146}- When?|- Stop it.
{86152}{86240}- No, tell me. When?|- I don't know.
{86268}{86330}How's it you don't know?
{86357}{86415}While you were at Lake Tahoe.
{86430}{86525}- And where was Cecilia?|- She was sick.
{86530}{86587}Was it at her place?
{86593}{86645}- No.|- Where then?
{86674}{86745}- At a party.|- What party, asshole?
{86751}{86816}I don't know, dude.
{86822}{86895}It was Fruity Loopy's party, |I guess.
{86902}{87004}The party when Saba took her cherry?
{87040}{87140}- I guess so?|- What are you laughing, asshole?
{87150}{87221}- Saba.|- Don't laugh!
{87227}{87355}- Who started it?|- Both. We were so fucking drunk.
{87413}{87468}And where did you do it?
{87474}{87535}In the sister's room.
{87600}{87651}How was Ana dressed?
{87657}{87765}- Shit! I can't remember.|- Was she wearing pants or a skirt?
{87783}{87840}What panties was she wearing?
{87845}{87940}- What panties? You've heard me!|- White, I guess.
{87945}{88006}- Did she take it in her mouth?|- No!
{88011}{88082}Look at me, idiot.|Did she suck it?
{88088}{88171}- Did you lick her?|- No, of course not.
{88177}{88298}- Did she come?|- How do I know? It was very quick.
{88304}{88368}- Did she enjoy it?|- How could I know?
{88374}{88456}- And you, asshole, did you enjoy it?|- No, no.
{88462}{88555}I felt like shit, I swear.
{88561}{88600}I wanted to tell you...
{88605}{88654}Fuck off, asshole!|To hell!
{88660}{88740}You've broken our friendship.|The trust!
{88745}{88832}You made my girlfriend.|You've screwed me!
{88838}{88943}And me, idiot, bringing you those |fucking comics from Lake Tahoe.
{88948}{89040}And a shit of a dress|for that whore of Ana, fuck!
{89046}{89085}Fuck off, dude.
{89115}{89165}Fuck off.
{89212}{89320}Tenoch, forgive me, pal.
{89347}{89395}I didn't do it on purpose.
{89405}{89460}Not on purpose?
{89465}{89555}You can maybe stomp her foot |not on purpose, not screw her!
{89561}{89586}Right? Not make her!
{89591}{89645}- Not make her!|- No.
{89676}{89731}He went on all night long.
{89737}{89844}Tenoch engaged himself in an|endless quest for details.
{89849}{89970}He wanted to make a puzzle with pieces |that wouldn't always match.
{89989}{90119}In the meanwhile, Julio melted some|details to build a less painful truth.
{90568}{90670}Lady Martina gave Luisa the stuffed mouse|with her name on it as a present.
{90676}{90760}It belonged to her grand-nephew|Luisa Obregn...
{90766}{90871}...died of a sunstroke crossing|the desert of Arizona...
{90877}{90950}...looking for a better future.
{90976}{91081}Luisa believed that the dead |kept being present.
{91087}{91230}She wondered how long she would live on |in other people's memories.
{91256}{91360}But she didn't want to fill her mind |with thoughts of death.
{91662}{91745}She heat has hit you, too?
{91909}{91975}A crazy heat.
{92026}{92100}Hey, where are you going?
{92107}{92172}- Stay here.|- I wanna see Rasputin.
{92177}{92247}Listen, I don't like the idea.
{92253}{92356}Had Julio come into my room, |it would have been the same.
{92380}{92420}Bullshit.
{92425}{92498}If you think I'm the driver,|fuck yourselves.
{92504}{92547}Go fuck off!
{92622}{92660}Calm down!
{92665}{92721}Fucking hogs!
{92947}{92971}Me, me, me, me.
{93615}{93674}- The shoes.|- The what?
{93679}{93736}Shoes.
{93742}{93808}Okay, pull'em off.|Now...
{93950}{94010}...this way, this way, this way.
{94060}{94094}Come here!
{94161}{94204}Give it to me.
{94299}{94370}Come, feel me.|Be calm. Quiet.
{94376}{94424}Look at me.
{94429}{94469}Look at me.
{94716}{94784}- Wait for me.|- Careful.
{94883}{94929}I'm sorry.
{94935}{94989}Nevermind. Be quiet.
{94994}{95051}Luisa, I'm sorry.
{95076}{95106}It's just that...
{95492}{95559}Don't act this way, come on!
{95634}{95705}Wasn't this what you wanted?
{95711}{95764}It was your game, right?
{95769}{95829}Taking me on a trip |to fuck me, wasn't it?
{95835}{95919}So what?
{95965}{96033}God, what idiots.
{96038}{96149}I shouldn't have done it|with none of you.
{96155}{96214}That's what I should have done.
{96219}{96289}I didn't want to hurt anyone.
{96294}{96339}Do you believe me?
{96376}{96436}- Do you forgive me?|- Yes, yes.
{96442}{96470}Let's go.
{96824}{96859}Me too.
{96865}{96919}- You too, what?|- Julio.
{96924}{96977}Me too, asshole.
{96983}{97101}- You too what?|- I made your girlfriend, Ceci.
{97117}{97164}It's not true.
{97259}{97334}- When?|- After the Plastilina Mosh gig.
{97339}{97387}Son of a bitch.
{97393}{97479}That's why you brought me home|first, right, asshole?
{97584}{97649}- Where?|- My place.
{97677}{97734}- Your place?|- In my room, dude.
{97739}{97812}- She had flowered panties.|- Did you screw her?
{97818}{97904}- The asshole made mine.|- What happened to Three?
{97909}{97981}Three: Don't fuck the others' girlfriends.
{97987}{98054}That's Five!
{98060}{98109}Get out!
{98115}{98207}Get out, asshole!|Now I'll tear you to pieces!
{98212}{98270}- Open!|- Hey, guys, stop it!
{98276}{98307}Fuck...
{98313}{98399}A classic for a boor.
{98404}{98474}Now the boor's gonna|smash your face!
{98480}{98524}Blow me, dork!
{98529}{98575}- Fuck off!|- Snob queer!
{98581}{98654}- To hell.|- Julio listen...
{98676}{98740}Son of a bitch!
{98746}{98829}I thought you were different, |but you're animals!
{98834}{98882}The futile Manifesto!
{98888}{98967}Not following your own rules!
{98972}{99080}You mark your territory and quarrel |but you just want to screw each other!
{99086}{99144}That's what you like!
{99150}{99260}Who cares if you screw each other's |women, if you come immediately?
{99276}{99399}Who made me do this?|I'm here changing diapers.
{99600}{99660}Seen, asshole?
{99666}{99726}- Come on, get out, open!|- No.
{99732}{99792}- She's leaving.|- You've pushed her.
{99798}{99864}How could you make my Ceci?
{99870}{99934}That whore!
{99939}{100006}- So we're even, right?|- Even?
{100012}{100142}Not fucking even! Get on your knees, like you |made me do.
{100148}{100184}- Come on!|- I'm sorry.
{100190}{100293}- On your knees, son of a bitch!|- She's looking for a lift.
{100298}{100379}I know, asshole! On your knees!
{100413}{100461}Move away.
{100467}{100532}- Move away if you want me to get out.|- Here you go.
{100538}{100604}Come on, I won't do anything.|Out.
{100772}{100800}Sorry.
{100805}{100847}On both your knees.
{100853}{100954}I beg your pardon, Julio, for screwing |your girlfriend, okay?
{100959}{101039}Come on, idot, she's leaving.
{101107}{101199}- How many times did you make her?|- Just once, what do you think?
{101235}{101293}You're not a charrolastra anymore!
{101298}{101374}- You don't mean anything to me anymore.|- You neither.
{101379}{101444}You're a piece of shit!
{101479}{101549}- Come on, Luisa, get in.|- No.
{101555}{101664}I'll take a bus to Puerto Escondido!|To hell with you and Heaven's Mouth.
{101670}{101705}We want to go there with you.
{101710}{101768}Why? To quarrel.|No, thanks.
{101773}{101854}- We won't quarrel.|- We promise.
{101860}{101910}I can picture myself, with two dorks.
{101916}{102005}- We've been assholes.|- We'll do as you say.
{102011}{102045}You command.
{102051}{102179}It's a few steps from here!|- it's close, come on.
{102193}{102249}But we do as I say.
{102254}{102324}At the first quarrel, I'll go away.
{102329}{102374}As you say.
{102380}{102439}Now I'll set my rules.
{102444}{102507}I'll make my Manifesto.
{102513}{102556}You've gone beyond, Julio.
{102603}{102744}One: I won't fuck with any of you.|Fuck each other, if you wish.
{102749}{102856}Two: I sunbathe naked and|I don't want you around and horny.
{102862}{102924}Three: I choose the music.
{102929}{103029}Four: You're required to kindly |shut up when I say so.
{103034}{103094}Five: You cook.
{103100}{103229}Six: Not another word on your|poor girlfriends.
{103235}{103365}Seven: Keep a distance of 6 meters.|If I prefer so, 100.
{103379}{103489}Eight: You'll take care of all the labor.
{103495}{103590}Nine: You'll speak only if you already agree.
{103596}{103694}But if you just shut up, it's better.
{103699}{103794}And Ten: It's forbidden to contradict me.
{103800}{103845}And especially pushing me.
{104015}{104089}Julio and Tenoch didn't know |where they were...
{104095}{104176}...or how to get to their destination.
{104182}{104289}Saba's indications|were contradictory.
{104295}{104425}Afraid that Luisa might found out, |Julio took a country lane.
{106128}{106197}They thought Luisa was sleeping.
{106202}{106279}They didn't know that her fear prevented |her from doing so.
{106285}{106414}It had nothing to do with darkness|or with what was surrounding her.
{109324}{109374}Hey!
{109380}{109449}We got ceviche...
{109476}{109551}...fried fish and beer!
{109890}{109991}Jesus Carranza, known as "Chuy",|and his wife Mabel...
{109996}{110092}...the fourth generation |of a fishermen family.
{110098}{110189}They lived there, close to San Bernabe.
{110194}{110302}Chuy offered himself to escort them|to the beaches the next day.
{110308}{110433}He asked them 350 pesos,|including lunch.
{110880}{110934}- Let me drive it!|- No.
{110940}{111010}- I know how to.|- Fine then.
{111016}{111089}- Don't push it too much.|- I know, I know.
{111095}{111184}- Nice place to have a bath, that one.|- Name?
{111189}{111272}- The Heaven's Mouth.|- Very beautiful.
{111359}{111384}Fine.
{111730}{111824}Lucero!|Don't harass the lady!
{111838}{111914}Don't worry, Mabel!|He's teaching me how to swim.
{111940}{112025}- I'll help you.|- No, I can make it on my own, thanks.
{112031}{112144}Go to your friend, he's all lonely.|The water is warm. Go.
{112266}{112364}Let's see how you play dead.
{112384}{112450}Oh, she's dead.
{112456}{112495}Oh, Lucero.
{112652}{112765}Christian is a whiner.|He spends all night crying.
{112771}{112842}He only stops in my arms.
{112848}{112972}He likes to be with his little sister.|So pretty, isn't she?
{112978}{113064}She looks a lot like you, Mabel.|Same eyes.
{113070}{113187}You should have sons, lady.|It shows you know how to handle them.
{113193}{113249}You're the in the right age, right?
{113359}{113431}He fell asleep.|What do I do?
{113436}{113515}Marquez passes to Ramon.|Ramon places on  Zepeda.
{113521}{113642}He stands out like a colossus |of Santa Ursula.
{113648}{113744}Claudio the emperor steals the ball.|You can trust him!
{113749}{113814}A trustworthy emperor!
{113819}{113944}His majesty goes on,|looks for a personal score.
{113971}{114030}Just shoot, heck!
{114036}{114075}Here we are.
{114080}{114134}A pass to Cuauhtemoc|Which stops it.
{114140}{114204}He advances towards the goal...
{114209}{114249}...and shoots!
{114276}{114334}The "human wall"!
{114368}{114419}Campos!
{114499}{114624}That's why he's a regular of the national team!|That's why!
{114681}{114719}What?
{114732}{114767}Don't you like Campos?
{115107}{115174}Wouldn't you want to live forever?
{115204}{115268}- Yes.|- It'd be beautiful.
{115315}{115359}No?
{115538}{115639}By the end of the year, the family|will move away...
{115644}{115759}...because a new luxury hotel |will rise in San Bernabe.
{115765}{115856}They'll move to the suburbs|of Santa Maria Colotepec.
{115863}{115934}Chuy will create a transports |company...
{115940}{116047}...but will be hindered by|the Acapulco syndicates...
{116053}{116124}...and by the Consortium of Tourism.
{116132}{116235}Two years later, he'll be a cleaner|in a hotel.
{116240}{116285}He won't fish anymore.
{116405}{116479}- Heck?|- What?
{116496}{116534}What the hell?
{116551}{116619}- Speed up Chuy!|- Shit.
{116624}{116689}Get away from here, you bastards!
{116809}{116879}Not that way, no!
{116889}{116959}They're shitting inside here, dude!
{117068}{117127}Get out, bastards!
{117132}{117211}- You're throwing shit on me!|- Out!
{117282}{117339}Let's go!
{117408}{117464}Quick, litlle shit!
{117489}{117565}The pigs tore the camp|to pieces.
{117571}{117674}It was evening already, and Julio and Tenoch|decided to sleep in the city.
{117680}{117806}For 75 pesos, Chuy had found them |a room with light and a toilet.
{117812}{117916}Luisa was tempted by the idea|of a shower, although a cold one.
{117922}{118007}They would go tomorrow |to pick up their stuff.
{118039}{118129}The 23 pigs had run away|from a farm near there.
{118134}{118222}During the following 2 months, |14 were sacrificed.
{118228}{118322}3 will cause a gall-bladder|infection...
{118328}{118429}...after having being eaten|at the "El Chavarin" ranch.
{118609}{118650}Don't spin, asshole!
{118655}{118746}Tell your mother what you want.
{118767}{118856}Let me talk.|Let me talk or I'll hang up.
{118862}{118937}I would have left anyway, Jano...
{118942}{119037}...your call makes everything easier.|I' grateful for that.
{119042}{119110}This is not a revenge.
{119115}{119225}I've always known about your betrayals|Carmen in Escorial...
{119231}{119332}...and the one in Barcelona.|I've always known.
{119338}{119444}I just hoped you would change,|that's all.
{119450}{119530}My decision has nothing|to do with that.
{119536}{119629}I can't explain now,|but soon you'll understand, okay?
{119634}{119763}Don't blame yourself|and don't blame me...
{119768}{119844}...it's nobody's fault.
{119866}{119994}No, I don't hate you.|And please, don't hate me.
{120028}{120092}Listen, Jano, listen.
{120098}{120206}I'm calling to say that I love you,|and that you've been my life.
{120212}{120329}I don't expect a happy farewell,|but let it be affectionate, at least.
{120375}{120469}Calm down, please don't|act this way, please.
{120553}{120671}Did you notice I took less money than |what was due?
{120677}{120759}No, I don't need more.|I'm fine.
{120764}{120844}I let my keys in the kitchen.
{120850}{120944}Don't lose the terrace key,|there's just one copy.
{120970}{121032}I took the T-shirts from Ibiza.
{121038}{121104}You know I like to sleep in them.
{121115}{121214}I just hope you learn to be happy.
{121220}{121275}I am now.
{121281}{121371}Take care, Jano.|I'll hang up now, okay? Bye.
{121647}{121714}Fuck you! Rematch!
{121900}{122002}I'm grateful to all the women|Jano has betrayed me with.
{122007}{122054}How did I notice?
{122060}{122162}Fucking with him. He experimented with me|the things he learned from the others.
{122167}{122241}- You finally understand.|- Like the finger in the ass, right?
{122246}{122279}- Yes.|- Come on, really?
{122284}{122408}But you must know how to do it.|With delicacy.
{122413}{122534}You can't just stick it in.|Jano was a master of finesse.
{122541}{122612}- To the master of finesse!|- To Jano!
{122618}{122677}Jano, wherever you are.
{122683}{122768}I'm glad I've met you.
{122773}{122864}Sometimes you're fuckheads,|but in the end...
{122870}{122963}...you're really smart.
{122968}{123069}You have the luck of living|in a country like Mexico.
{123075}{123159}You can breath life everywhere here.
{123165}{123234}To the sweet Mexico!|- To Mexico!
{123239}{123284}Magic and musical.
{123305}{123380}- So, are you friends or not?|- No.
{123386}{123444}Come on, make peace.
{123455}{123537}- And so I'm a boor?|- Right that.
{123543}{123634}- Do you remember that big thing?|- Fuck, that's my car.
{123640}{123694}And me, Mr. Delicacy?
{123699}{123805}- Okay, okay. A hip guy.|- But you like coming to my place?
{123810}{123882}To see what your father steals.
{123887}{123979}But his father is a honest man, right?
{124002}{124059}Isn't he honest?
{124116}{124180}What assholes!|Now you're friends again.
{124186}{124254}- To the charrolastras!|- To the charolastras!
{124260}{124319}- Want beer?|- Yeah, pretty cold.
{124324}{124369}Sure, sure.
{124427}{124465}- Luisa.|- What?
{124471}{124560}- I'm sorry for the push.|- Oh, Julio...
{124566}{124619}- ...you went beyond.|- I know.
{124624}{124684}- Give me a kiss.|- Forgive me.
{124696}{124739}You're forgiven.
{124745}{124782}Hey, Luisa...
{124788}{124824}...tell us the truth:
{124829}{124904}Who fucks better, between us?|The truth.
{124909}{124989}- You make me laugh.|- Come on.
{125050}{125115}Each one has certain qualities.
{125120}{125194}But who made you feel better?
{125200}{125259}I'll mimic Tenoch coming:
{125264}{125329}"Honey. Honey!"
{125334}{125434}- I don't believe it, pal.|- Julio crosses his eyes.
{125494}{125596}But you must stop jacking off|and improve your resistance.
{125602}{125675}- He came sooner than me!|- Both do some training.
{125681}{125776}- And number Seven?|- Eliminate it.
{125810}{125876}Chuy, isn't jacking off cool?
{125910}{125963}- To jacking off!|- Yeah!
{125968}{126044}You can't toast to jacking off!
{126049}{126091}By the way:
{126120}{126194}You don't know how to lick it.
{126200}{126309}- I didn't do it at all.|- You're surely as lame as Tenoch.
{126314}{126414}You licked it like that, |like it were an icicle.
{126419}{126520}It must be done with care. The clitoris|must be a great friend of yours.
{126525}{126606}It's a problem to find |a great friend.
{126612}{126715}Search and you shall find.|There's no greater pleasure than giving it.
{126721}{126804}- An applause for the clitoris!|- Yes!
{126839}{126934}- Up the clitoris.|- Up the clitoris.
{126982}{127051}Listen, seriously...
{127057}{127134}Truth, I want the truth:
{127153}{127201}Ceci sucked you off.
{127207}{127262}The truth?
{127268}{127360}- She nibbled it a bit, dude.|- Shit, she sucked you off!
{127366}{127459}- Ana bites, too?|- No, she sucks greatly!
{127464}{127559}- You said she didn't suck you off.|- Only the tip.
{127564}{127639}She missed the big dish.
{127694}{127802}- Aren't blow jobs great, Chuy?|- Heck, Chuy!
{127807}{127861}- Up the blow jobs!|- Wait.
{127866}{127941}Since we're telling the truth:
{127947}{128054}I made Ceci many times.
{128094}{128215}No problem. I screwed Ana|many times, too.
{128221}{128349}- I've been there mixing up the cream.|- Me too!
{128357}{128474}Do you realize we're |foster-brothers?
{128645}{128727}He made my girl, |but he comes in a blink!
{128733}{128842}To your girlfriends, |who are making 10 Italians at a time!
{128848}{128899}- To Luigi!|- To Francesco!
{128905}{128955}I toast to Tiberio!
{128961}{129045}- Got any change?|- Who wants the little maggot here?
{129051}{129084}I'll take it.
{129089}{129149}Hey, Tenoch.
{129155}{129206}- And your mother, too, you know?|- What?
{129223}{129304}Really.|The day she washed my clothes.
{129355}{129399}Are you serious?
{129404}{129459}Absolutely!
{129538}{129614}- Cheers!|- You're crazy.
{129620}{129689}Luisa! To all mothers!
{129796}{129849}Who sings the "Fandunga"?
{129855}{129930}- "La Fandunga"?|- Are you joking?
{129935}{130022}Actually no.|Give me a number and a letter.
{130028}{130084}Thirteen.
{130108}{130154}- Ah... B.|- 13-B.
{135197}{135305}After Heaven's mouth there's Palikata|and the beaches of Chacrita...
{135310}{135342}...and Santa Rita.
{135348}{135432}- And Chacagua.|- "Chacagua. " What wonderful names.
{135437}{135520}- What do they mean?|- I don't know.
{136175}{136242}- Good morning, sleepyhead.|- Sleepyhead.
{136248}{136294}Want some eggs?
{136336}{136414}- A shrimp soup?|- Please. And a beer.
{136419}{136484}The best antidote.
{136489}{136580}- I gotta give the car back to my sister.|- Fine.
{136585}{136652}- Was it Chacue...|- Chacagua.
{136658}{136755}- Is there anything after Chacagua?|- There's Amaranto.
{136761}{136849}Golden Beach is there.|Huge, with many waves.
{136854}{136974}Many people drown there.|But it's wonderful.
{136980}{137074}- Some more soup.|- No, thanks.
{137079}{137164}I must go.|My parents must be worried.
{137170}{137244}And Julio must give the car back|to his sister.
{137249}{137332}I was talking with Mabel|about staying here some more...
{137338}{137399}...to see some bays.
{137405}{137518}- I'm hungry, mom.|- Well, here you go.
{137765}{137809}Go, go!
{138145}{138251}That day Julio and Tenoch|started their trip back home.
{138264}{138352}It was a silent trip|with no events.
{138357}{138487}Their parents never knew|they had gone to the sea with Luisa.
{138504}{138634}Luisa stayed exploring|the bays around.
{138685}{138783}Parting from Tenoch and Julio,|Luisa told them:
{138789}{138897}"Life is like the foam of the sea.|You must dive into it".
{139306}{139428}On their return, Ana and Cecilia|broke up with Tenoch and Julio.
{139434}{139526}Two months later, Tenoch began|going out with a neighbor.
{139531}{139654}It took 11 months for Julio to go out|with a French course mate.
{139670}{139757}Julio and Tenoch hung together less |and less.
{139770}{139815}The next summer, the PRI...
{139820}{139929}...lost the elections for the|first time in 71 years.
{139934}{140008}Julio met Tenoch|who was going to the dentist.
{140014}{140119}A coffee was less uncomfortable|than the excuses not to do it.
{140149}{140247}- And Saba, have you ever met him again?|- I know he lives in Real de Catorce.
{140253}{140325}Really? Fine.
{140331}{140367}And Daniel?
{140389}{140437}Self-declared queer.
{140460}{140522}His father kicked him out of home.
{140564}{140665}- A big trouble, isn't it?|- On the contrary, he's happy.
{140670}{140732}He's even got a boyfriend and stuff.
{140753}{140797}It's fine then.
{140813}{140904}- I've been admitted to the University.|- Great! When will you start?
{140910}{140977}- In September.|- Economics?
{140983}{141023}Yep.
{141028}{141137}- And you?|- Biology at the UAM. Next week.
{141142}{141237}- What a bad luck, huh?|- Yes. The UAM begins sooner.
{141440}{141502}Do you know about Luisa?
{141525}{141562}No.
{141608}{141635}What?
{141641}{141702}- She's dead.|- What the fuck are you saying?
{141707}{141782}- Anything else, guys?|- No, thanks.
{141836}{141901}- And how?|- Cancer.
{141915}{141982}She had it everywhere.
{141990}{142097}It happened there in San Bernabe.|A month after our departure.
{142103}{142172}Chuy called Jano, and that was all.
{142198}{142242}Terrible.
{142247}{142332}When we met her,|she already knew she had to die.
{142349}{142402}She didn't want to tell anyone.
{142580}{142707}Luisa spent her last 4 days|in the Hospital of Santa Maria Colotepec.
{142716}{142750}By her request...
{142755}{142861}... Chuy and Mabel never revealed|her adventure with Tenoch and Julio.
{142869}{142992}Before dying, gave Lucero the stuffed|mouse with her name as a present.
{143059}{143162}Tenoch apologized. His girlfriend|was waiting for him at the cinema.
{143167}{143237}Julio insisted to pay the bill.
{143255}{143297}They never met again.
{143302}{143357}- Hear you, huh?|- Yep.
{143724}{143754}The bill, please.
{151723}{151748}Orgazmo DivX
