PART ONE
THE MEN AND THE MAGGOTS

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,138
"Revolution is war. Of all the wars known in history
it is the only lawful, rightful, just and truly great war.

11
00:01:19,173 --> 00:01:30,100
 In Russia, this war has been declared and begun."
Lenin, 1905

12
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,731
Sailors Matyushenko
and Vakulinchuk.

13
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:52,659
We, the sailors of "Potemkin",
must support our brothers the workers.
We must stand in the front ranks of the revolution!

14
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:02,735
The men slept heavily
after the watch.

15
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:53,206
Watchful but clumsy.

16
00:02:55,154 --> 00:02:57,286
It is easy to vent one's
rage on a recruit.

17
00:03:19,427 --> 00:03:21,289
it is offensive...

18
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:29,666
Vakulintchuk.

19
00:03:33,064 --> 00:03:38,463
Comrades! The time has come
for us to speak out.

20
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:53,980
What are we waiting for?
All of Russia has risen.
Are we to be the last to do so?

21
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:11,546
On the following morning.

22
00:05:18,024 --> 00:05:21,855
We've had enough rotten
meat!

23
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,774
It's not fit for pigs!

24
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:49,824
Ship's doctor Smirnov.

25
00:05:54,235 --> 00:05:57,439
The meat could crawl
overboard on its own!

26
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,979
Those are not worms.

27
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:30,855
They are only maggots.
Wash them out with brine.

28
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:46,518
Russian POW's in Japan
are fed better!

29
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:49,796
We've had enough rotten meat!

30
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:12,520
Stop that talk! It's good meat.

31
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:52,502
Gilyarovsky, a senior officer.

32
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:53,076
Boiling soup.
The men seethed with rage.

33
00:11:06,592 --> 00:11:07,838
The ship's store.

34
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:41,405
The men refused to eat the soup.

35
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:42,412
Give us this day...
our daily bread.

36
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:05,619
PART TWO
DRAMA IN THE HARBOUR

37
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,667
All hands on deck!

38
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,735
Ship's captain Golikov.

39
00:15:17,732 --> 00:15:19,853
All who enjoyed their soup,
step forward!

40
00:15:23,498 --> 00:15:24,505
The pretty officers.

41
00:15:42,646 --> 00:15:43,692
Step back!

42
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:52,240
I'll string the rest of
you up on the yard!

43
00:16:32,956 --> 00:16:34,461
Call the guard!

44
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:50,081
Matyusshenko instructed the
men to meet by the turret.

45
00:17:01,284 --> 00:17:02,141
To the turret!

46
00:17:07,546 --> 00:17:08,752
To the turret!

47
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:06,012
Most of the men gathered by the turret.

48
00:18:24,277 --> 00:18:26,802
Halt!
Stay where you are!

49
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:47,944
The men tried to escape
through the Admiral's hatch.

50
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:57,919
Back! The hatch is not
for the likes of you.

51
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:11,814
I'll shoot you down like dogs!

52
00:19:23,984 --> 00:19:25,635
Cover them with tarpaulin.

53
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,333
Aye-aye, sir!

54
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,986
Cover them!

55
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:38,884
Attention!

56
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,419
Bring the unruly to reason, O Lord...

57
00:21:19,642 --> 00:21:22,842
At the tarpaulin.

58
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:15,098
Vakulinchuck decided to act.

59
00:22:16,578 --> 00:22:17,632
Fire!

60
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:18,652
Brothers!

61
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:20,870
Who are you shooting at?

62
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:24,786
The rifles wavered.

63
00:22:27,771 --> 00:22:30,374
Fire!

64
00:22:32,783 --> 00:22:33,953
Fire!

65
00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:40,684
Fire, you swine!

66
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:53,400
Take your rifles, mates!

67
00:22:58,472 --> 00:23:01,334
Let those blackguards have it!

68
00:23:02,274 --> 00:23:04,223
Give it to them!

69
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:32,348
Remember the Lord!

70
00:24:39,568 --> 00:24:41,676
Out of my way!

71
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:25,406
He's gone to feed the fishes!

72
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:33,677
We've won, mates!

73
00:28:48,492 --> 00:28:50,484
Vakulinchuk is overboard!

74
00:29:28,124 --> 00:29:34,074
He who was the first to call for an uprising,
fell at the hands of a butcher.

75
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:57,838
To the shore.

76
00:30:20,392 --> 00:30:21,292
Odessa.

77
00:30:27,401 --> 00:30:33,033
A tent on the new pier:
Vakulinchuk's last moorings.

78
00:30:33,068 --> 00:30:35,081
Killed for a plate of soup.

79
00:31:19,078 --> 00:31:23,285
PART THREE
A DEAD MAN CALLS FOR JUSTICE

80
00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:29,401
A mist spread over the sea.

81
00:32:47,785 --> 00:32:49,754
A rumour spread from the pier...

82
00:34:17,027 --> 00:34:20,842
The news reached town with the sunrise.

83
00:34:31,812 --> 00:34:33,809
There's an uprising on the "Potemkin"...

84
00:34:40,107 --> 00:34:41,509
An uprising!...

85
00:35:02,523 --> 00:35:03,640
We won't forget!

86
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,709
Killed for a plate of soup.

87
00:36:49,031 --> 00:36:53,965
"People of Odessa! "Here lies Vakulinchuk
a sailor, brutally "murdered by an officer
of the battleship "Potemkin".


88
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:05,084
"Prince of Tauride.""Death to the opressors!
"We shall take revenge!" 
The ship's crew.

89
00:37:35,576 --> 00:37:39,224
Eternal glory to those who
died for the revolution!

90
00:37:41,962 --> 00:37:43,773
All for one!

91
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,240
And one

92
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,276
for all.

93
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:42,012
Down with the butchers!

94
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,553
Down with tsarism!

95
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:26,604
Mothers, sisters, brothers!
Let nothing divide us!

96
00:39:32,113 --> 00:39:34,332
Kill the Jews!

97
00:40:14,327 --> 00:40:15,728
Shoulder to shoulder.

98
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,437
The land is ours!

99
00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:28,862
The future is ours!

100
00:40:56,281 --> 00:40:58,627
Delegates from Odessa.

101
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:05,417
We must deal the enemy
a decisive blow.

102
00:41:08,401 --> 00:41:11,561
Together with the workers
of Russia

103
00:41:16,237 --> 00:41:18,009
we shall fight and win!

104
00:41:30,793 --> 00:41:36,632
Odessa followed the progress
of the uprising...

105
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:15,301
PART FOUR
THE ODESSA STAIRCASE

106
00:42:15,336 --> 00:42:19,659
Odessa was with
the sailors.

107
00:42:24,774 --> 00:42:29,157
Boats streamed to the battleship.

108
00:46:24,262 --> 00:46:26,227
Suddenly...

109
00:48:48,234 --> 00:48:49,493
Let's go and talk them out of it.

110
00:49:43,194 --> 00:49:45,730
Do you hear that?
Don't shoot!

111
00:50:01,895 --> 00:50:05,181
My boy is very ill.

112
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:21,812
The Cossacks.

113
00:52:31,101 --> 00:52:36,100
The ship's guns roared in
reply to the massacre.

114
00:52:38,324 --> 00:52:40,659
The target
- the Odessa Opera House.

115
00:52:42,399 --> 00:52:44,699
At the enemy stronghold!

116
00:53:02,084 --> 00:53:05,961
PART FIVE
THE MEETING WITH THE SQUADRON

117
00:53:05,996 --> 00:53:08,557
Stormy meetings went on all day.

118
00:53:17,131 --> 00:53:23,004
Odessa awaits her liberators!
If you land, the troops will join you.

119
00:53:44,642 --> 00:53:49,567
We cannot land. The flag
squadron is moving on us.

120
00:54:16,626 --> 00:54:20,335
The "Potemkin" prepared
to meet the squadron.

121
00:54:29,878 --> 00:54:33,677
Night fell, a night
fraught with anxiety.

122
00:55:41,006 --> 00:55:45,535
The squadron approached
in the dark.

123
00:56:32,198 --> 00:56:37,528
The men were silent.

124
00:58:21,936 --> 00:58:24,322
Squadron sighted!

125
00:59:36,732 --> 00:59:38,550
All hands on deck!

126
00:59:44,804 --> 00:59:46,766
To action stations!

127
01:01:38,018 --> 01:01:39,344
Full steam ahead!

128
01:02:52,941 --> 01:02:54,269
Meet them head on!

129
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:36,592
Full steam ahead!

130
01:03:51,392 --> 01:03:54,099
The "Potemkin" was escorted
by destroyer 267.

131
01:03:57,872 --> 01:03:59,300
The attack began!

132
01:04:15,992 --> 01:04:18,019
The squadron bore down
on the battleship.

133
01:04:56,073 --> 01:04:59,154
Signal to them
to join us!

134
01:05:03,982 --> 01:05:05,897
Join...

135
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:09,451
...us!

136
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:29,982
The enemy is within
firing range!

137
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:42,080
All against one.

138
01:06:03,367 --> 01:06:04,665
One against all.

139
01:06:29,856 --> 01:06:31,592
Will they...

140
01:06:36,936 --> 01:06:37,971
open fire?

141
01:06:47,946 --> 01:06:49,331
Brothers!

142
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:23,755
A thunderous hurrah
rang out.

143
01:07:31,417 --> 01:07:38,654
The "Potemkin" passed through the squadron,
the flag of freedom fluttering over her.

144
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:14,693
