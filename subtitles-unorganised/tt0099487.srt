1
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,520
Snuggle in, sweetie! It's cold out there.

2
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,740
Why is it snowing, Grandma?
Where does it come from?

3
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,730
Oh, that's a long story, sweetheart.

4
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,910
- I wanna hear.
- Oh, not tonight. Go to sleep.

5
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,910
I'm not sleepy. Tell me, please.

6
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,080
Well, all right.

7
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,670
Let's see...

8
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,000
I guess it would have to start with... scissors!

9
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,170
Scissors?

10
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,930
Well, there are all kinds of scissors.

11
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,810
And once there was even a man
who had scissors for hands.

12
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,860
- A man?
- Yes.

13
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,690
- Hands scissors?
- No, scissor hands.

14
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,530
You know the mansion
on top of the mountain?

15
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,740
It's haunted.

16
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,910
Well...

17
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,620
A long time ago...

18
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,800
...an inventor lived in that mansion.

19
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,090
He made many things, I suppose.

20
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,220
<i>He also created a man.</i>

21
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:30,890
<i>He gave him insides,</i>
<i>a heart, a brain, everything.</i>

22
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,140
<i>Well, almost everything.</i>

23
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,440
<i>You see, the inventor was very old.</i>

24
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,030
<i>He died before he got to finish</i>
<i>the man he invented.</i>

25
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,290
<i>So the man was left by himself...</i>

26
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,460
<i>... incomplete and all alone.</i>

27
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,170
<i>He didn't have a name?</i>

28
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,960
<i>Of course he had a name.</i>

29
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,840
<i>His name was Edward.</i>

30
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,270
Avon calling!

31
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,690
- Weren't you just here?
- No, not since last season!

32
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:59,190
Today I've come to show you our exquisite
new line of softer colours, in shadows...

33
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,020
...blushes and lipstick.

34
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,820
Everything you need to accent and highlight
your changing look.

35
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,240
My changing look... That's good!

36
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,830
I also have a complete selection
of your old favourites...

37
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,330
...those tried and true products we've all
come to depend on year in and year out.

38
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,000
Come on, Peg,
I never buy anything from you.

39
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,220
I know. Bye, Helen.

40
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:26,470
Um, you didn't have to call me, ma'am.
You could have taken care of this by yourself.

41
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,630
I could? I don't think so.

42
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,510
It's easy. Your food trap's clogged, that's all.

43
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,060
See this bolt here? You just unscrew this...

44
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,770
Mm-hm...

45
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,600
And out she pops.

46
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,230
On TV they say you repairmen
are a lonely bunch.

47
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,070
Housewives get lonely too, though you may
not realise it since they haven't made an ad.

48
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,080
And then you just take this and put it back in
here nice and easy. Be careful not to force it.

49
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,410
And then you just screw this back on.

50
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,460
Oh, now who could that be?

51
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,330
Will you excuse me for a moment?

52
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,180
Now, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
This is fascinatin'!

53
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,670
I wouldn't wanna miss a moment of it!

54
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,560
- Good morning, Joyce. Avon calling!
- Why, Peg...

55
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,850
Have you gone blind?
Can't you see that vehicle in my drive?

56
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,610
Oh. Yes.

57
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,190
Don't you realise that means I'm busy?

58
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,490
OK, now we should decide on lipsticks.

59
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,240
OK, dear, did you like the Winsome Wahini,
which looked charming on you...

60
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,740
...or the Bahimini Bliss?

61
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,910
- I like 'em both.
- Well, great!

62
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,170
You don't actually think
I have any money, do you?

63
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,850
Ding-dong! The Avon lady!

64
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,780
Just not my day.

65
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,720
Oh, my goodness!

66
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,410
Oh, it's so beautiful!

67
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,310
Hello?

68
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,210
Hello?

69
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,520
Hello? Avon calling!

70
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,840
Oh, my!

71
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,470
Hello?

72
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,480
Hello?

73
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:18,490
I'm Peg Boggs.
I'm your local Avon representative. Hello?

74
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:34,340
I... I'm sorry to barge in like this,
but you don't have any reason to be afraid.

75
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:38,130
Ooh! This is some huge house, isn't it?

76
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,970
Thank goodness
for those aerobics... classes.

77
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,400
Hello? Hello?

78
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,780
Why are you hiding back there?

79
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,500
You don't have to hide from me.
I'm Peg Boggs.

80
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,990
I'm your local Avon representative...

81
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,170
...and I'm as harmless as cherry pie...

82
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,590
Oh, my!

83
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,210
I can see that I've disturbed you.

84
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,510
How stupid of me. I'll just be going now.

85
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,670
Don't go.

86
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,060
Oh, my!

87
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,060
What happened to you?

88
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,190
- I'm not finished.
- Ohh!

89
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,900
Put those down.
Don't come any closer. Please...

90
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,740
Those are your hands?

91
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,080
Those are your hands!

92
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,210
What happened to you?

93
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,750
Where are your parents? Um...

94
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,760
Your mother?

95
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,100
Your father?

96
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,390
He didn't wake up.

97
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,900
Are you alone?
Do you live up here all by yourself?

98
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,150
What happened to your face?

99
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,290
I won't hurt you.

100
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,120
At the very least,
let me give you a good astringent.

101
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,620
This will help to prevent infection.

102
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,180
What's your name?

103
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,600
Edward.

104
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,020
Edward...

105
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,690
I think you should just come home with me.

106
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,630
Ohh!

107
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,120
- I'm... I'm sorry.
- No. No, don't be.

108
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,510
You go ahead and look.
You have every reason to be excited.

109
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,590
Oh! You OK?

110
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,190
You OK?

111
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,830
Hello?

112
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,550
Hi. Yeah, it's Marge.

113
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,550
I was standing outside talking to Carol, and
Peg drove by. She had somebody with her.

114
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,400
- Did you get a good look at him?
- No, I didn't.

115
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,100
Did she say anything to you
about having a guest?

116
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,520
Nothing at all.
She rang my doorbell at the crack of dawn.

117
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,560
No... OK, I'll meet you on the corner.

118
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,730
Right. Bye.

119
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,530
Oh! Damn!

120
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,420
Here we go, dear. This is our house.

121
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,130
You can just go right in
and make yourself right at home, OK?

122
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,560
We'll have something to eat or drink, or...
Whatever you...

123
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,520
Here, dear. Here we go. This is the front door.
Here we go. Right in here.

124
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:44,900
Joyce? I just saw this strange guy
drive in with Peg. I didn't get a good look.

125
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,810
He looked kinda pale.

126
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,190
On my way. Don't do anything without me.

127
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,360
Yes! Be right there!

128
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,320
Here we are.

129
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:22,020
So... um, this is the living room
and back here are the bedrooms.

130
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,150
You want to see the pictures? All right.

131
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,690
Well, this is my husband Bill.
He's a bowling champion.

132
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,110
Do you know what bowling is?

133
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,030
Bowling?

134
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,040
No. Well... Here they are
down at the lake, fishing.

135
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,250
I think Kevin looks a little glum
because they didn't catch anything that day.

136
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,790
And, um... here's my daughter Kim.

137
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,500
All dressed for the junior prom.

138
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,470
She's a senior now, if you can believe it!

139
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,100
She's camping in the mountains
with friends...

140
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,110
...but she'll be back in a few days.
You can meet then.

141
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,610
Isn't she beautiful?

142
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,540
That's my family.

143
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,140
Come along.
I'll show you the rest of the house.

144
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,050
Then you can just freshen up
and make yourself at home.

145
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,050
That's the kitchen over there.
Help yourself to anything you want.

146
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,640
Those are grapes.
And, um... back here are the bedrooms.

147
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,600
Let me get you some towels
and I'll see what we can find for you to wear.

148
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,820
You know what? I think I have some of
Bill's old clothes in here. This is perfect!

149
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,820
Here. These should just fit you.

150
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,530
Oh! Don't be alarmed. That's just the phone.

151
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:04,080
Now you can go in Kim's room
and put these on, and I'll be right with you.

152
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,940
No, no, scissors. No, scissors.

153
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:57,110
That's right. Well, he was...
born up there or... something.

154
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,190
- <i>Have you seen him before?</i>
- No, I doubt he's ever been off the grounds.

155
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,070
<i>Then how did you ever get together with him?</i>

156
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,290
Listen, I have to go now.
I'll talk to you later, Marge. Bye-bye.

157
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,380
Sorry, Edward, I didn't...

158
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,300
May I help you with this?

159
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,470
Thank you.

160
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,150
There you go. Oh dear, you've cut your face.

161
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,770
Here. Let me just get this right off.

162
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,850
- Does that hurt?
- No.

163
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,350
Good. OK. Now, let's get you dressed.

164
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,690
OK...

165
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,360
There we go. Very fine!

166
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,990
You look fine, just fine!

167
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,920
Helen, come on! She wouldn't wait for you.

168
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,920
I've got rollers in my damn hair!

169
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,070
OK...

170
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,240
Now, what did I do with my sciss?

171
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,780
Edward, um... would you?

172
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,080
Thank you.

173
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,240
You know, I have a doctor friend
who I think could help you.

174
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,830
- Really?
- Yes.

175
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,880
Now, I can help with the scars...

176
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:50,550
But I just wanna consult the big
Avon handbook before doing anything.

177
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,100
Kevin!

178
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,350
Kevin!

179
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,520
It's not polite to stare, dear.

180
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,410
Think how it would make you feel
if somebody were staring at you.

181
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,670
- I wouldn't care.
- Well, I would, so don't do it!

182
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,280
Well, this must be
quite a change for you, right, Ed?

183
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,790
- Edward, dear. I think he prefers Edward.
- Oh, sure.

184
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:07,210
So what have you been doin' with yourself
up there in that big old place? I bet the...

185
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,050
- I bet the view must be spectacular, huh, Ed?
- Edward!

186
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,760
Yes?

187
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,430
No, I... I just...

188
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,360
See all the way to the ocean, I bet, huh?

189
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,270
Sometimes.

190
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,900
Bill, could I have the salt and pepper, please?

191
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:31,870
Bill, dear, could I have
the salt and pepper, please? Thank you.

192
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,150
Kevin!

193
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,830
Kevin!

194
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,550
Man, those things are cool!

195
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,590
I bet they're razor-sharp.
One karate chop to a guy's neck...

196
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,150
Kevin!

197
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:03,110
Edward...

198
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,480
...would you like some butter for your bread?

199
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,740
Great!

200
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,240
Thank you.

201
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,340
Hey, can I bring him to
show and tell on Monday?

202
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,460
Kevin, I've had enough.

203
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,300
Do you think you can sleep?

204
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:32,800
I know things feel strange,
but soon you'll feel right at home.

205
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,760
- Good night.
- Good night.

206
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,030
The light concealing cream goes on first...

207
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,780
...then you blend and blend and blend.

208
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,830
Blending is the secret.

209
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,000
Mm-hm!

210
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,460
More concealing cream...

211
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:52,170
Your complexion is so fair!

212
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,800
Now, this has a touch of lavender in it...

213
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,600
Give it a try here.

214
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,970
Close enough!

215
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,550
OK, this should do the trick here.

216
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,350
Hmph!

217
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,810
I have another idea.

218
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:16,030
We'll cover up the scars
and start with a completely smooth surface.

219
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,960
Darn this stuff!

220
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,520
<i>They still have 11 on the scoreboard,</i>
<i>and it's three to one.</i>

221
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,820
<i>It's through the gap to Warren.</i>

222
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,860
<i>Now they change it to 12 hits.</i>

223
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,110
Turn it up, Kevin, I can't hear it!

224
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,700
Kevin!

225
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,540
- <i>It's hammered!</i>
- Did you hear that, Mr Boggs?

226
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,000
- No, make it louder!
- <i>It's gone...</i>

227
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,160
<i>... it's out of here, it's history!</i>

228
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,140
Dad...

229
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,930
Look!

230
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:24,300
<i>... to make it a five-run inning</i>
<i>and blow this game to pieces!</i>

231
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,220
I'll be darned.

232
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,200
They filled the whole tape!

233
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:47,370
<i>What's going on over there, Peg?</i>
<i>Call me.</i>

234
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,580
<i>Hi, it's Marge. Who is he? Call me.</i>

235
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:55,080
<i>Oh, by the way, I hear it's pouring rain in</i>
<i>the mountains. Do you think the kids are OK?</i>

236
00:29:55,170 --> 00:30:00,050
<i>Hey there, darlin'! The gals are</i>
<i>all in a tizzy about your secret visitor.</i>

237
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,680
<i>You can't keep him a secret for ever!</i>

238
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:22,020
Well, it's just wonderful, Ed. My God,
you have the whole family in there, don't ya?

239
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,200
<i>And he answers the challenge at first</i>
<i>with a strike of his own.</i>

240
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,700
Edward, come here.

241
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,880
No, no, no, that's a terrible idea, son!

242
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:43,840
Go to the garage and get the oil can.
We don't want him rusting up on us.

243
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,310
Ohh!

244
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,720
Edward, you did us!

245
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,730
- Oh, Bill, it's us!
- Yes, it is.

246
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,900
Oh, Edward!

247
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:04,780
It's not heaven he's from,
it's straight from the stinking flames of hell.

248
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,410
The power of Satan is in him, I can feel it.

249
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,950
- Can't you? Have you sheep strayed so far?
- We're not sheep.

250
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,120
Don't come near me.

251
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,830
That's right. Go on, get outta here, run!

252
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:22,000
Edward, don't you listen to her!

253
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:26,760
Don't worry about her, Edward.
She's just a little loony, that's all.

254
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,020
Hi!

255
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:37,020
You-all are hidin' in there like hermit crabs.

256
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,940
Hi, Joyce. Hi!

257
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,110
Shame on you,
keepin' your unusual guest to yourself.

258
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,490
We think that's mighty selfish of you.

259
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,240
Things have been hectic here.

260
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,410
That is so sweet of you
to wanna correct the situation.

261
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,370
What time <i>does</i> the barbecue begin?

262
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,920
Barbecue?

263
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,870
You intend to introduce
your guest to your friends...

264
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,040
...don't you?
- I'll bring coleslaw.

265
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:02,420
And I will bring the ambrosia salad!

266
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,300
- What time was it that you said?
- Uh, what time...

267
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:08,470
- Bill!
- About five?

268
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,970
Bill!

269
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,390
He has been sent first to tempt you!

270
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:18,480
But it's not too late.
You must push him from you, expel him.

271
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,020
Trample down the perversion of nature.

272
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:24,860
Did you hear that?
He's a perversion of nature.

273
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,940
Why, isn't that excitin'?

274
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,070
- Bye-bye.
- Thanks so much.

275
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,750
Bill! Bill?

276
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:45,420
You really can't have a picnic or a barbecue
without devilled eggs.

277
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,720
They're just... the best. They make a thing.

278
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:53,600
Oh, Edward, that's wonderful!
I didn't know you'd chopped the whole thing.

279
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,510
We're gonna be...

280
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,010
Oh. All right now, it's just a nick.

281
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,810
There's no need to be nervous, dear.

282
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:06,410
Esmeralda won't be here. And the rest of
the neighbours, they're really very nice.

283
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:09,860
There's no need to be nervous.
They're so eager to meet you!

284
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,780
You just have to be yourself.

285
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,490
- Myself?
- That's right. Just your own sweet self.

286
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,480
- Thanks, Edward.
- Hey! Play scissors, paper, stone with us.

287
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,770
Play scissors what?

288
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,730
I got a doctor friend
might be able to help you.

289
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:55,690
- He did them just like that!
- That is incredible.

290
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,320
- Hi, Mike, how you doin'?
- Hello, Jack.

291
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,820
Hey, kids!

292
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,130
Hi, George Monroe. That's a heck of
a handshake you got there, Ed.

293
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,250
Harry! I saw you
on the golf course last week...

294
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,470
Are you OK? Do you want something to eat?
Are you hungry?

295
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,560
Do you want a cracker?

296
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,100
- He's different.
- Completely different.

297
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,010
No kidding.

298
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,180
- He's so...
- Mysterious.

299
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,650
Yeah.

300
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:29,600
D'you imagine those hands are hot or cold?

301
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,230
And just think what a single snip could do.

302
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,520
Or undo.

303
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,820
Eddie. Eddie.

304
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:41,330
The guys and I want to invite you
to our card game Friday night.

305
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,210
Would you like that?

306
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,370
Only thing is... you can't cut!

307
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,810
I have my own infirmity.
Never did me a bit of harm.

308
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:07,020
Took some shrapnel during the war,
and ever since then I can't feel a thing!

309
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:12,390
Don't you ever let anybody tell you
you have a handicap.

310
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,690
Who's handicapped? My goodness.

311
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:20,280
Don't be ridiculous!
You're not handicapped, you're...

312
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,290
What do they call the... exceptional?

313
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:29,870
My name's Joyce, and I noticed that you
have not tasted any of the ambrosia salad...

314
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,340
...that I made especially for you.

315
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,250
Allow me.

316
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,170
Mmm!

317
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,140
Mmmm!

318
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:47,770
- You must try this. It's my mother's recipe.
- Doesn't this look gorgeous?

319
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:52,400
With a green thumb like yours,
I sure could use your help at my place.

320
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,480
I want a row of angels!

321
00:37:55,570 --> 00:38:01,110
I am so sorry, ladies, but he's promised to
come to my house first. Haven't you, Eddie?

322
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,620
- I did?
- OK, everybody, grab your plates!

323
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,500
Soup's on!

324
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,540
Azhuzhizha zhigabab.

325
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,790
- What?
- I thuzhizha zhizhgabab.

326
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,370
It <i>is</i> shish kebab. It was a figure of speech.

327
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,920
You shouldn't take things so literally.

328
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:23,880
<i>"Let us pretend we are in the drawing</i>
<i>room and the hostess is serving tea."</i>

329
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:28,850
"Many numerous little questions
confront us."

330
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,860
"Should the man rise
when he accepts his cup of tea?"

331
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,820
"May lump sugar be taken with the fingers?"

332
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,150
No.

333
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,080
"Is it good form to accept a second cup?"

334
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,540
"Should the napkin be entirely unfolded...

335
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:51,880
...or should the centre crease
be allowed to remain?"

336
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,830
"It is so easy to commit
embarrassing blunders...

337
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,540
...but etiquette tells us
just what is expected of us...

338
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,500
...and guards us from all
humiliation and discomfort."

339
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,140
Mm, yes. Boring.

340
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,270
Let us switch to, uh...

341
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,310
...to some poetry, hm?

342
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,270
"There was an old man from the Cape,"

343
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,910
"Who made himself garments of crepe."

344
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,120
"When asked: Will they tear?"

345
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,330
"He replied: Here and there,"

346
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,910
"But they keep such a beautiful shape!"

347
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:37,870
That's right.

348
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:40,340
Go ahead, smile. It's funny.

349
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,500
That's right.

350
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,780
We're home.

351
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,700
Shit.

352
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,610
Everything's still sopping.

353
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:13,210
- I can hardly wait to take a shower.
- And to sleep in a bed.

354
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:16,160
If my parents have the alarm set,
I'm screwed.

355
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,790
I told you to call them
and tell them we're coming back early.

356
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,460
- But did you?
- Nope, he'd rather complain.

357
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,710
How else am I supposed to get attention?

358
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,850
- You didn't call your parents.
- They don't run things like a police state.

359
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,560
- Bye. Thanks for driving, Denny.
- Bye.

360
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,350
- Bye.
- Bye.

361
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,560
- Don't forget your arm!
- Oh, yeah.

362
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,720
Come on, Jim, let's go.

363
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:40,490
There's somebody in my room!
Go look! Look!

364
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:43,920
He's a murderer! He's got an axe!
He tried to kill me!

365
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,300
- Everything's OK.
- Mom, go look!

366
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,460
Go back to bed, Kevin.

367
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,590
This way.

368
00:41:55,690 --> 00:42:00,270
Edward's come to live with us.
There is nothing to be upset about.

369
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:04,900
OK. We'll have you set up here in a minute.

370
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:08,320
We got a full queen-size bed here,
believe it or not.

371
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:12,780
Oh, it's all made and everything. Good.

372
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,580
There you go.

373
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,700
What's the matter? What's wrong?

374
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,870
She get you nervous?

375
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,880
You've been cloistered away
up in that castle too long.

376
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,010
You don't know about the wonderful world
of teenage girls. They're all crazy.

377
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:32,590
- Here, this'll straighten you right out.
- What is it?

378
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,760
Lemonade.

379
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,730
I don't know what it is.

380
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,850
They reach a certain age...

381
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,190
They develop these gland things,
their bodies swell up...

382
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,610
They go crazy.

383
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,080
Glands?

384
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,240
Yeah, glands.

385
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,950
I try not to think about it.

386
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:23,390
Good, isn't it?

387
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,570
Now, you stay in Kevin's room tonight
and tomorrow we'll fix your room right up.

388
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,480
Why did you have to bring him here?

389
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:33,940
I couldn't have left him all alone.
You'd have done the same.

390
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,910
Why does he have to stay <i>here?</i>

391
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,740
My goodness, Kim, I'm surprised at you.
He can't help the way he is.

392
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:43,080
- Have a little sympathy.
- I do have sympathy.

393
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:47,120
Then say a little greeting.
Come downstairs, shake the man's hand...

394
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,970
- Shake his hand?!
- Well, not literally.

395
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:54,180
- Goodness, you scared him half to death!
- I scared <i>him</i> to death?

396
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:04,940
Hi, Bill! I just wanted you two
to have a proper introduction.

397
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,180
Edward, this is our daughter Kim.

398
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,730
Kim, this is Edward,
who's gonna live with us.

399
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,990
Hi.

400
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,990
H-h-h... H-h-h...

401
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,930
Eddie!

402
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,800
Thirsty?

403
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:41,300
Kisses! Hush up!

404
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,440
Shh, quiet now!

405
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,190
Darlin', I can hardly hear myself think!
Momma's precious little baby girl...

406
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,660
Aah! Wouldn't you like
a nice cool glass of lemonade?

407
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,750
Lemonade?

408
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,260
One chop to a guy's neck, and it's all over.

409
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:18,640
Sharpest things in the world.
They can hack through anything.

410
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,930
And...

411
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,830
They give me the creeps.

412
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:43,950
You should see the clown
in Miss Peters' yard.

413
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:45,950
Kim!

414
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,210
- Oh, no.
- That's him?

415
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,500
- He's calling you, Kimba.
- Stop it!

416
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:54,290
Edward, you forgot your cookies.

417
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:59,380
Don't worry, Eddie. She's waiting for ya!

418
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,880
- Stop!
- Let's go.

419
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,850
Bill, Edward had lunch at Jackie's today...

420
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,980
...and she just had
her kitchen completely redone.

421
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:17,320
- I'll be darned.
- New paint, new cabinets, new floors...

422
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:21,270
...a new microwave, new silent dishwasher...
- Isn't that wonderful?

423
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:24,700
Jim, didn't you just tell me
your mom had her kitchen done too?

424
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:27,360
Yeah, my dad bought himself
a bunch of new toys.

425
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:30,960
Big-screen TV, CD players,
VCR with four heads...

426
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:35,290
My goodness sake!
I wonder what it's like to be that rich.

427
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:37,960
They keep things locked up.

428
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:41,470
My father has his own room for his stuff
to make sure I can't use it.

429
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,470
He won't even help me buy an old car.

430
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:48,720
He probably wants you to pay for it yourself.
It builds character. You'll appreciate it more.

431
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,270
Dad!

432
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:55,180
Speaking of money... I understand you're
not charging for your gardening, Edward.

433
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,230
Now, Bill... Marge made him cookies today.

434
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,400
Sweetheart...

435
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,620
You can't buy
the necessities of life with cookies.

436
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,460
You can't buy a car with cookies.
Am I right, Jim?

437
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,660
Uh, that's true, sir, you can't.

438
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:15,120
I... I can't eat that. He used his hands.

439
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,620
It's... I don't think it's sanitary.

440
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:24,840
I'm sorry.

441
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,890
Honey, you want me
to help you clean that up?

442
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,890
No, that's OK.

443
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:35,730
I'll be right back.

444
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:27,280
Alexis? Oh, this can't possibly be my Alexis!

445
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:32,120
She looks so beautiful! Look at you! Sweetie!

446
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,990
She's gorgeous. Thank you!

447
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,960
It won't be long.
She just has to decide on the style.

448
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,130
And then it'll be fine.

449
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,690
I was hopin' for somethin' big
and kinda bouffant. Kinda like mine?

450
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:02,690
Now don't you worry, Kisses, you're gonna
be just fine. You're gonna be so pretty.

451
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,490
Yes, you are. Oh!

452
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:06,450
Oh! My!

453
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:09,990
Oh! Ohh!

454
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,090
Oh! Eddie, is there anything you can't do?

455
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:28,180
You take my very breath away, I swear.
Look at this!

456
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,640
Have you ever cut a woman's hair?

457
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:33,520
Would you cut mine?

458
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:45,510
That was the single most thrillin' experience
of my whole life.

459
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:52,820
They're getting the head of the company!

460
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:56,160
- I'm home!
- Hi, honey. We're in here.

461
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:58,160
- Hi.
- Hi!

462
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,040
What did you do to your hair?

463
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,200
Edward cut it. Isn't it wild?

464
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,040
Hello? Oh, I can't believe
I'm talking to you in person.

465
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:09,210
This is such an honour.

466
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,210
Yes. He's right here.

467
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,300
So then you know all about it.

468
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:18,720
Uh-huh. Well, that's exactly
what I've been using.

469
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:25,770
Well, I've had a little trouble getting it
the right consistency... well, just a little.

470
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:28,810
I'll try that. Uh-huh.

471
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:33,820
Well, what imaginative suggestions.

472
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:38,780
I sure will. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

473
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:42,110
No wonder she's the head of the company.

474
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:45,830
You know, she started out as
a sales representative just like me.

475
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,700
I've always wanted to talk to her,
but until now I never had a reason.

476
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,880
Thanks, Edward.

477
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,210
- She had some ideas?
- You bet she did.

478
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,560
- Uh-huh!
- Mm-hm!

479
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,730
I'll get that.

480
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:55,360
Edward. We're here.

481
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:57,770
Come on, let's get you sharpened up.

482
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,780
- You got it?
- No. I can't believe this.

483
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:05,750
This is such a drag.

484
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,340
Hi!

485
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,870
- Bye.
- Bye.

486
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:16,930
Do you have a key?

487
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:18,210
No.

488
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,520
- I could have sworn they were in my purse.
- Well, we're stranded.

489
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:28,890
Wow! Thanks!

490
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:34,480
Ed! What a guy! Good job.
You didn't break it or scratch it or anything.

491
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:37,360
Hey, be a pal and yell
when Peg pulls in, huh?

492
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:44,330
Quite a story, yes?
Any questions for Edward?

493
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:46,540
Yeah? Get away over.

494
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,080
Stand right up.

495
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:51,290
What's been the best part
of your new life here in town?

496
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,620
The friends I've made.

497
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:57,590
Any other questions?

498
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:02,380
Have you ever thought of having
corrective surgery or prosthetics?

499
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:05,340
I know a doctor
that might be able to help you.

500
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,640
I'd like to meet him.

501
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:11,350
We'll get that name after the show.
Thank you. That's very nice.

502
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,680
Anyone else? Yes, stand right up.

503
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:16,310
But then you'd be like everyone else.

504
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:18,400
Yes, I know.

505
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:20,150
I think he'd like that.

506
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,820
But then no one would
think you were special.

507
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:25,030
You wouldn't be on TV or anything.

508
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,160
No matter what,
Edward will always be special.

509
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,540
More questions? Yes. Stand right up.

510
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:40,220
Your work is so interesting,
distinctive and unique.

511
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,300
Do you have any plans
to open your own beauty salon?

512
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:45,470
Oh, there's an idea!

513
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,310
Anyone else? Yeah. Stand right up.

514
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,230
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Ohhhh!

515
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,310
Sure he does. Right, Kim?

516
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:03,320
- Right, Kim?
- Great! Now you got him started.

517
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,150
Knock it off, bubble-butt.

518
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,870
- You did it.
- So?

519
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,530
<i>How about it, Edward?</i>
<i>Is there some special lady in your life?</i>

520
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:17,750
Ooh...

521
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:46,900
Uh... everything's all right. We'll take a break
and we'll be back after these messages.

522
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,870
Why are you laughing? He got hurt!

523
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,490
- It was just a little shock. What do you care?
- A little shock?!

524
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:57,590
I wish we'd been taping that.
I'd give my left nut to see that again.

525
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,790
Aren't you excited? This is so thrillin'!

526
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,550
Wait till I show it to you. It's just perfect.
It's just what we've been lookin' for.

527
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,130
I wanna call it Shear Heaven!

528
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:12,470
Ohh! And here we are.

529
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:16,150
Now, all along here
I'm gonna put a row of new mirrors.

530
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:18,600
And back along here, well, I think...

531
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:20,570
Eddie! Come along, doll.

532
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:26,160
Back up here a whole row of new cosmetics.
And all along this row here...

533
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:31,160
- Peg could sell cosmetics.
- Yeah... Sure.

534
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:34,000
And this of course
is where we wash the hair.

535
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,920
And here is where I stand...
when I greet the customers.

536
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,120
But back in here
is what I really wanna show you.

537
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:49,220
Eddie... This is what
I really want to show you.

538
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:52,560
Now, this is the storeroom
where we keep everything...

539
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,810
...and what I need from you today
is a decision I need you to help me make.

540
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,930
Oh, honey, no! No, don't. That's dangerous.

541
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:02,520
Now, you just sit right down there...

542
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:09,240
I have some smocks.
Would you like me to model them for you?

543
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,040
Yes.

544
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,200
OK.

545
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:29,010
<i>* With these hands</i>

546
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,930
<i>* I will cling to you</i>

547
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:38,940
<i>* I'm yours for ever</i>

548
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,650
<i>* And a day</i>

549
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:42,810
Now, this is my favourite.

550
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,480
Because it's yellow...

551
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:48,990
And what it's for...

552
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:54,750
...is to catch those itchy little
trimmings that fall down your neck.

553
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:01,210
And then there's this old purple one
that you just kinda...

554
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,250
...drape around you like this.

555
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,880
I like that one.

556
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:12,930
Why, Eddie, you're tremblin'.

557
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:17,550
So am I!

558
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,560
I've been waitin' for this moment for so long.

559
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:25,140
<i>* And with these hands</i>

560
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:30,660
<i>* I'll provide for you</i>

561
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,500
<i>* Should there be a stormy sea</i>

562
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:40,290
<i>* I'll turn the tide for you</i>

563
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:43,130
<i>* And I'll never</i>

564
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:47,800
<i>* Oh no, I'll never</i>

565
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:53,500
<i>* I'll never let you go</i>

566
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,010
Aagghh!

567
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:04,730
Edward!

568
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:07,770
Edward, you come back here!
You can't do that!

569
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:21,750
Velcro, sweetheart.

570
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,750
- It hangs on the dashboard.
- I've never seen that.

571
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,830
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hi, Edward.

572
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,040
Sorry, dear, we had to go ahead without you.
There you go.

573
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,840
So, Edward, did you have a productive day?

574
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:35,420
Mrs Monroe showed me
where the salon will be.

575
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,100
- You could have a cosmetics counter.
- Wouldn't that be great?

576
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,180
Great.

577
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:44,640
Then she showed me the back room
where she took all her clothes off.

578
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:49,430
Edward, I can't tell you how thrilled I am.
I'm as pleased as punch.

579
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:52,020
This venture's gonna teach you volumes.

580
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:55,070
There's nothin' like
running your own business.

581
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,990
I've never done it myself...

582
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:01,210
...but I gather it's the greatest satisfaction
a working man can have.

583
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,990
So I guess the bank's
gonna be your next step, huh?

584
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:06,710
The bank?

585
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,250
Yeah. Take out a loan, get yourself started.

586
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:16,170
Nothin' to worry about. With your talent
and reputation, it's gonna be a snap.

587
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:17,970
Yeah.

588
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:22,180
No credit...

589
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:24,680
...no record ofjobs you've held...

590
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:26,600
...no savings...

591
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:28,770
...no personal investments...

592
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:32,940
No social security number -
you may as well not even exist...

593
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:37,190
- There is no collateral.
- No, we already have a second on the house.

594
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:39,530
But don't the testimonials count?

595
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:43,490
Did you see here the mayor's wife
can't wait to become a client?

596
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,540
We simply can't do it.

597
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:50,790
Now, get yourself a social security card,
establish credit and buy yourself a car.

598
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,830
You have a decided advantage.
You can get a handicapped placard...

599
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:56,750
...and park anywhere you like.

600
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:02,730
I can't believe it. It's just an outrage.

601
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:07,640
But don't you worry. This isn't the end of it.
We'll get your money somehow.

602
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:14,270
- But that's breaking and entering.
- My parents have insurance up the rear.

603
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:17,900
What'll it cost them?
A little hassle, that's about it.

604
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:21,160
- We can't.
- This guy'll give us cash for the stuff.

605
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:22,820
I don't want to.

606
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:27,410
You don't want us to have our own van where
we can be alone? And a mattress in the back?

607
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,040
Why can't <i>you</i> do it?

608
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:32,250
Because the room's locked
and we need Edward to get us in.

609
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,630
Can't you take the key when he's sleeping?

610
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,840
The only thing he hangs on to tighter
is his dick.

611
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:41,340
- Razor Blades'll do anything for you.
- That's not true.

612
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:44,140
- Oh, no? Why don't you ask him?
- That's not fair.

613
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:47,810
- So what? There isn't any other way.
- There's gotta be.

614
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,980
Look, I've racked my brain.

615
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:53,270
Don't you want us to have our own van?

616
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,570
Well... yeah.

617
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,990
Jim, the lights are on!

618
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:03,910
Those go on automatically.
They're gone for the weekend, I told you.

619
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,740
In case of burglars.

620
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:08,240
- You turned off the alarm?
- Yes. Let's go.

621
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:10,210
I hate this.

622
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:13,710
Are you sure he doesn't know
this is Jim's house?

623
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,920
- This person stole from you?
- Shh! Keep it down!

624
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:19,050
I told you he stole it, OK? Let's go!

625
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:21,970
Tell his parents
and they'll make him give it back.

626
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:26,550
Listen, I already tried that.
Now, you told Kim you'd do this. Let's go.

627
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,440
Come on!

628
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:30,890
Come on!

629
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:35,310
OK, come on. Come on.

630
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:39,230
Come on, come on, come on! Now! Come on!

631
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,300
The bastard had it wired separately.
Come on!

632
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:09,640
No, Jim, we can'tjust leave him here!

633
01:04:17,740 --> 01:04:19,530
- Come on.
- I'm not gonna do this!

634
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:21,690
- Just come on, Kim.
- Stop!

635
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,360
Put me down!

636
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,910
Put me down!

637
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,440
<i>We know you're in there!</i>

638
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:59,600
<i>We're in the process of deactivating</i>
<i>the system so that you can come out!</i>

639
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:13,460
- Denny, turn around!
- No way.

640
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:16,660
Jim, they can't arrest you
for setting off your own alarm.

641
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,580
We'll tell 'em we freaked and ran.

642
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:20,960
- I'm not going back there, OK?
- We have to!

643
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,880
No. My father would prosecute.

644
01:05:22,970 --> 01:05:25,130
- His own son?
- Especially his own son.

645
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:27,380
And if Edward tells I'll kill him!

646
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:30,130
- Denny, turn around!
- No!

647
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:31,720
You have to!

648
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:35,600
<i>We want your hands high in the air</i>
<i>where we can see them!</i>

649
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:42,940
<i>Put your hands up!</i>

650
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,650
He's holding something. Looks like knives.

651
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:52,540
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

652
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,450
<i>I repeat- drop your weapons!</i>

653
01:05:56,540 --> 01:06:01,340
<i>I'm gonna ask you one more time.</i>
<i>This is your last warning. Drop your weapons.</i>

654
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:10,640
<i>If you fail to do so we'll have to open fire.</i>
<i>Don't make us do that, buddy.</i>

655
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:13,810
<i>Drop your weapons. Drop 'em!</i>

656
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,180
<i>Now!</i>

657
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:17,180
Looks like we got a psycho.

658
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:19,310
- Prepare to fire!
- No! No!

659
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:23,530
- Stand back, ladies!
- Those aren't weapons, those are his hands!

660
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:25,690
Please. We know him.

661
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:28,990
All right. Cuff him.

662
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:39,740
- But we can see him now?
- We're going to have to hold him overnight.

663
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:44,460
- He has to stay in prison all night?
- You can pick him up in the morning.

664
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:46,630
Oh, Edward!

665
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,970
Hello, Edward.

666
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:51,590
Oh, Edward, dear. I blame myself.

667
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:55,020
What in God's name
was going through your mind, son?

668
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:59,730
Why didn't I set a better example?
You saw how I envied Jim's parents.

669
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:02,020
What were you gonna do with that stuff?

670
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:05,480
I blithely say "We'll get money
for the salon somehow"...

671
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:07,480
...but I never meant stealing.

672
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:11,950
Dear, stealing's not the way to get it.
Stealing's not the way to get anything.

673
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:15,790
Uh-uh. Except trouble.
And you're in a serious heap of that.

674
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:18,500
Oh, Edward. Why ever did you do this?

675
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:22,170
- Damn those TV programmes!
- Damn them all to hell!

676
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:24,410
Or did somebody put you up to this?

677
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,930
Will he be OK, doc?

678
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:45,060
The years spent in isolation have not given
him the tools to judge right from wrong.

679
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:48,490
He's had no context.
He's been completely without guidance.

680
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:52,520
Furthermore his work, the garden sculptures,
hairstyles and so forth...

681
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:55,450
...indicate that he's a highly imaginative...

682
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:56,910
...character.

683
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,160
His awareness of what we call reality
is radically underdeveloped.

684
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:04,210
But will he be all right out there?

685
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:06,710
Oh, yeah. He'll be fine.

686
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:18,390
Listen, it could keep me up all night worrying
about ya. You watch yourself, you hear?

687
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:26,360
I happened to be up,
so I heard all this noise...

688
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:30,310
All along I felt in my gut
there was somethin' wrong with him.

689
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:35,240
- It could have been my house.
- Or any of our houses, but...

690
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:39,490
I warned you, didn't I?
I saw the sign of Satan on him.

691
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:44,410
You didn't heed my warning, but now
you will. Because now you can see it too.

692
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:02,020
Edward, you stay here.

693
01:09:02,110 --> 01:09:05,270
- What do you say in your defence?
- Nothing.

694
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:08,690
- He doesn't want to talk.
- You have to say something.

695
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:12,280
- He can't talk right now.
- No comments? No remarks?

696
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:15,700
So, were you set up?
What was going through your mind?

697
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:18,540
Huh? What do you have to say for yourself?

698
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:21,960
- One comment. One comment.
- Later.

699
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:26,200
Goodness, Lois, it looks like
I'll see you at our Christmas party...

700
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,580
...before I get you over for your haircut!

701
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:34,130
Well, of course we're gonna have it this year.
We have it every year. Why wouldn't we?

702
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:37,800
Well!

703
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:40,680
You may think that, but you're wrong.

704
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,430
You're here.

705
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:51,350
They didn't hurt you, did they?

706
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:55,780
Were you scared?

707
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:03,990
I tried to make Jim go back,
but you can't make Jim do anything.

708
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:12,910
Thank you for not telling them that we...

709
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:15,300
You're welcome.

710
01:10:18,430 --> 01:10:22,050
It must have been awful
when they told you whose house it was.

711
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:26,010
I knew it was Jim's house.

712
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:28,770
You... you did?

713
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:31,230
Yes.

714
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:35,230
Well, then why'd you do it?

715
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:39,360
Because you asked me to.

716
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:44,160
Kimba!

717
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:46,660
Kimmy! Hey!

718
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,290
- Don't!
- What's the matter with you?

719
01:10:57,390 --> 01:10:59,630
When are you gonna stop? I did what I could.

720
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:03,140
My old man thinks he's retarded, so he's free.
What more do you want?

721
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:06,510
- You could tell the truth.
- So could you. You were there too!

722
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:10,440
- You know I didn't wanna do it.
- But you did do it.

723
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:13,860
I don't get why you give such a shit anyway.

724
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,730
Maybe there's a way you can
replace the drapes and the towels...

725
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:52,400
...but our confidence in you
is not gonna be so easy to replace.

726
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,060
Dad...

727
01:11:55,200 --> 01:12:00,820
OK. A little ethics. You're walkin' down
the street. You find a suitcase full of money.

728
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:05,320
There's nobody around. No human person
is in evidence. What do you do?

729
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:07,820
A: You keep the money.

730
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,380
B: You use it to buy gifts
for your friends and your loved ones.

731
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:15,420
C: You give it to the poor.

732
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:19,340
D: You turn it in to the police.

733
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:21,840
- Dad, this is really stupid.
- Kim!

734
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:23,890
- I'd keep the money.
- Simmer down.

735
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:25,220
Edward?

736
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,640
Hey, how about after dinner we go down
to the bowling alley? That'd be fun.

737
01:12:30,730 --> 01:12:32,690
You're not seeing Jim tonight?

738
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:34,270
No.

739
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:37,140
We had the coolest show and tell today.

740
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:42,110
This kid brought in a box of baby possums.
Ten, maybe twelve. Totally naked.

741
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:46,360
- No hair at all.
- Honey, your father isn't finished yet.

742
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:49,580
Thank you, dear. Edward, we're waiting.

743
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:54,750
Give it to my loved ones?

744
01:12:57,970 --> 01:13:02,380
Oh, Edward, it does seem that
that's what you should do, but it's not.

745
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:09,730
You dope, everybody knows
you're supposed to give it to the police.

746
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:13,150
Good thinking, Kevin.

747
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:15,310
Well, think about it, you guys.

748
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:19,350
I mean, that's the nicer thing to do.
That's what <i>I would do.

749
01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:25,370
We're not trying to confuse him, we're trying
to make things easier, so cut the comedy.

750
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:28,570
I am being serious, Dad.
It's a much nicer thing to do.

751
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:31,240
Forget nice. We're talking right and wrong.

752
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:32,710
Shut up!

753
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:38,910
Oh, goodness! No wonder poor Edward can't
learn right from wrong, living in this family!

754
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:42,010
Well, did you hear
what he did to Peg's curtains?

755
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:46,010
It's unbelievable they're having
their party anyway. Are you going?

756
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:47,810
I don't think so.

757
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:51,220
He practically raped Joyce,
threatening her with those knives.

758
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:53,100
It's a miracle she escaped.

759
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:55,390
I have nothing against Bill and Peg, but...

760
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:58,770
I know. They've got that
teenage daughter in the house.

761
01:13:58,860 --> 01:14:01,780
Those poor things!
After what happened to me...

762
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,610
Can you imagine?

763
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,070
What did you say about the Christmas party?

764
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,200
I said I hoped we could make it.

765
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:10,200
I lied too.

766
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:33,100
Edward? Do you want to
give me that new haircut?

767
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:35,980
- Again?
- Yeah, sure!

768
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:40,440
It makes me proud to have you
as my own personal hairdresser.

769
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:44,860
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

770
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:47,980
- Kevin, want to play scissors, paper, stone?
- No.

771
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:51,330
- Why?
- It's boring. I'm tired of always winning.

772
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:54,580
- People's feelings, please. A few manners!
- I'll be outside.

773
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:59,000
Never you mind, dear.
Just... cut away. Cut away.

774
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,380

778
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:25,570
It needs something... else.
What do you think, honey?

779
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:28,570
- More bells?
- More bells. OK.

780
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:31,690
Mom, do you really think
we should be having this party?

781
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:34,570
Of course I think
we should be having this party.

782
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:41,330
It's just what we need to calm things down,
and... everything'll go back to normal. Hm?

783
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:45,330
Do you have any more bells, honey?

784
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:32,310
Hey!

785
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:39,540
Now you've done it.

786
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:42,110
It's just a scratch, Jim, really. It's OK.

787
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:45,250
- Touch her again and I'll kill ya.
- It's no big deal.

788
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:48,010
- Call a doctor. He skewered Kim.
- No!

789
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:49,920
Stay away from her. I mean it!

790
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:54,300
You can't touch anything without ruining it.
Why do you hang around here anyway?

791
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:58,880
I want you to sit right down
and wait for me to bring you some ice.

792
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:01,510
Stay right there. I'll be right back.

793
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:06,730
<i>* On Christmas day in the morning

794
01:18:07,570 --> 01:18:09,980
Get the hell outta here!

795
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:13,070
Get the hell out! Go! Freak!

796
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:15,980
Hey, Edward, where are you goin'?

797
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:25,490
Where is he?

798
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:28,290
- He tried to hurt you.
- He did not, and you know it.

799
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:30,840
Are you nuts? I just saw him!

800
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:35,800
Jim, I don't love you any more.
I just want you to go, OK? Just go!

801
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,300
Are you serious?

802
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:40,960
And lose you to that? He isn't even human.

803
01:18:41,060 --> 01:18:43,760
Just get out of here, OK? Just go!

804
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:53,820
Dad, did you see where Edward went?

805
01:18:53,910 --> 01:18:56,440
I don't know. He just waltzed down the street.

806
01:18:56,530 --> 01:18:59,490
- We have to find him, Mom.
- Your father will find him.

807
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:01,780
Go on in the house. I'll take care of it.

808
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:05,210
I'll go find him.

809
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:22,550
Edward!

810
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,720
I'm calling the police!

811
01:20:12,610 --> 01:20:15,890
See all that blood, sweetie?
And it's just a little cut.

812
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,320
Oh!

813
01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:28,700
Hello. I'm here to see the man with the hands.

814
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:31,960
Ohh!

815
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,000
- Uh...
- He's not here. Thank you.

816
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:38,210
Oh, dear.

817
01:20:39,970 --> 01:20:42,300
Helen, did you actually see him?

818
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:43,970
Yes! Look!

819
01:20:49,690 --> 01:20:51,810
I'm looking for the man with the scissors.

820
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:55,310
- Thank God you're here.
- He went right down that way, sir.

821
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:58,980
All right, calm down, calm down.
Go on home. We'll handle it.

822
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:00,900
Just go home.

823
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:04,910
- A... a demon. A demon.
- You gotta do somethin'!

824
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:15,040
I'm sure your father'll find him soon.

825
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,830
What time is it?

826
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:22,330
It's almost 8.30. Great party, huh?

827
01:21:22,430 --> 01:21:24,510
Mom, where are they?

828
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:29,060
- God, I hope he's OK.
- So do I, honey.

829
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:38,310
You know, when I brought Edward
down here to live with us...

830
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:42,360
...I really didn't think things through.

831
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:46,580
And I didn't think about
what could happen to him.

832
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:51,410
Or to us. Or to the neighbourhood.

833
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:55,870
And now I think that maybe...

834
01:21:57,630 --> 01:21:59,710
...it might be best if he goes...

835
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:03,290
...back up there.

836
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:06,210
Because at least there he's safe.

837
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:11,270
And we'd just... go back to normal.

838
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:17,350
I got halfway to the Whitmans'.
I didn't see him anywhere.

839
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,680
Let's get in the car and go look for him.

840
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:21,770
- Where's Kevin now?
- At Max's.

841
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:23,690
Oh, for God's sakes!

842
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:26,450
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- With you guys.

843
01:22:26,530 --> 01:22:30,950
- You stay here in case somebody shows up.
- We'll be right back, dear.

844
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:11,900
Police!

845
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,780
Edward?

846
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:55,280
Are you OK?

847
01:23:56,670 --> 01:23:58,460
Yes. Are <i>you</i> OK?

848
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:04,460
Where is everybody?

849
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:07,250
Out looking for you.

850
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:15,220
Hold me.

851
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:30,440
I can't.

852
01:24:59,190 --> 01:25:03,600
I know it's a little early
for Christmas, Edward, but...

853
01:25:06,990 --> 01:25:09,060
...I have a present for you.

854
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:09,310
Forget holding her hand.

855
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,970
Picture the damage he could do other places.

856
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:14,150
Yeah. That's sick.

857
01:27:19,330 --> 01:27:22,740
Ugh! I feel like I'm gonna pass out
or puke or something.

858
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:25,320
Later. First, take me to her house.

859
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:27,290
Come on. Don't make me drive.

860
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:28,920
Just do it!

861
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:31,460
Jesus. Maybe she <i>was</i> right about you.

862
01:27:31,550 --> 01:27:33,620
- Just drive!
- Relax!

863
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:40,930
- See you tomorrow. Call me.
- All right.

864
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:01,450
Have they caught him yet?

865
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:05,450
- Who?
- Him! That... that cripple.

866
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:11,040
Let me know when they do.

867
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:15,210
Let us all know, OK?

868
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:18,340
Like a good boy.

869
01:28:38,910 --> 01:28:40,370
Kevin.

870
01:28:44,660 --> 01:28:47,040
- Urgh!
- Are you OK?

871
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,620
- It's OK.
- Ow!

872
01:28:49,710 --> 01:28:51,790
Ow! Ow!

873
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,620
- Edward, stop!
- I'm your friend.

874
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:00,710
Help us!

875
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:06,100
What are you doing? Get away from him!

876
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:14,650
Hey...

877
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:16,610
- Let go of me!
- What?

878
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:18,490
Kevin!

879
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:28,290
- Get away!
- Edward, come home. Come home!

880
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:01,060
Run.

881
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:32,220
Kevin's all right!
It was just the tiniest scratch!

882
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:36,610
He's gone. Let's not bother him, all right?
Let's just leave him alone.

883
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,190
Go on, run.

884
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:54,500
- What happened? Is he dead?
- Did you get him?

885
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:58,290
It's all over. Go on home.
There's nothing more to see.

886
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:03,010
What happened out there?
I want to know! I want some answers!

887
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:05,170
It is all over.

888
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:08,180
Where is he? Where is he?

889
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:12,770
Get back here!
I wanna ask you something!

890
01:31:19,030 --> 01:31:21,270
Look at that! I don't believe this.

891
01:31:22,570 --> 01:31:24,560
They don't have him. I'm goin'.

892
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:26,730
No! That's not a good idea.

893
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:34,260
They're coming?

894
01:32:36,810 --> 01:32:38,800
Did I hurt Kevin?

895
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:42,430
No, he's OK. Mostly he was just scared.

896
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:47,110
Edward, I was so afraid.

897
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:49,980
I thought you were dead.

898
01:32:57,710 --> 01:32:59,250
I didn't.

899
01:33:08,050 --> 01:33:09,550
No!

900
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:20,810
No!

901
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:22,890
Jim, stop!

902
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:24,440
No!

903
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:40,860
No!

904
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:47,330
Stop it. Or I'll kill you myself.

905
01:33:54,510 --> 01:33:56,170
Aagh!

906
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:01,230
Hey! I said stay away from her!

907
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:03,200
Goodbye.

908
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:16,340
I love you.

909
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,430
I-Is he in there?

910
01:36:08,610 --> 01:36:10,350
He's dead.

911
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:16,310
The roof caved in on him.

912
01:36:17,370 --> 01:36:19,440
They killed each other.

913
01:36:22,410 --> 01:36:24,990
You can see for yourselves.

914
01:36:27,330 --> 01:36:28,660
See?

915
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:39,880
I'm goin' home.

916
01:36:48,730 --> 01:36:50,810
Joyce...

917
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,080
She never saw him again.

918
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:14,000
Not after that night.

919
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:16,920
How do you know?

920
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:25,760
Because I was there.

921
01:37:26,430 --> 01:37:30,180
You could have gone up there.
You still could go.

922
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:33,900
No, sweetheart.

923
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:36,060
I'm an old woman now.

924
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:39,820
I would rather him remember me
the way I was.

925
01:38:14,270 --> 01:38:16,350
How do you know he's still alive?

926
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:21,270
I... don't know.

927
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:23,770
Not for sure, but...

928
01:38:24,370 --> 01:38:26,660
I believe he is.

929
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:40,220
<i>You see, before he came down here...</i>

930
01:38:41,130 --> 01:38:43,210
<i>... it never snowed.</i>

931
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,970
And afterwards...

932
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:52,140
