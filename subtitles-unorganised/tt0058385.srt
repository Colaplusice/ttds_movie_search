1
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,433
Freddy, go and find a cab.

2
00:04:58,021 --> 00:05:00,227
Do you want me to catch pneumonia?

3
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:14,660
Don't just stand there, Freddy.
Go and find a cab.

4
00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:17,326
All right, I'll get one.

5
00:05:33,057 --> 00:05:36,223
Look where you're goin', dear.
Look where you're goin'!

6
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:37,596
I'm so sorry.

7
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:41,644
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.
A full day's wages.

8
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:46,193
-Freddy, go and find a cab.
-Yes, Mother.

9
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:51,113
He's your son, is he?

10
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,488
If you'd done your duty
as a mother should...

11
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:57,526
...you wouldn't let 'im spoil a poor girl's
flow'rs and run away without payin'.

12
00:05:57,622 --> 00:05:59,531
Go about your business, my girl.

13
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:02,411
And you wouldn't go off
without payin', either.

14
00:06:02,794 --> 00:06:05,581
Two bunches o' violets trod in the mud.

15
00:06:08,424 --> 00:06:11,297
Sir, is there any sign of it stopping?

16
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:13,878
I'm afraid not. It's worse than before.

17
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,346
If it's worse, it's a sign it's nearly over.

18
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:19,221
Cheer up, Capt'n,
buy a flow'r off a poor girl.

19
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:20,723
I'm sorry, I haven't any change.

20
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,435
I can change 'alf a crown.
Take this for tuppence.

21
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:26,015
I told you, I'm awfully sorry.
Wait a minute.

22
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,313
Oh, yes. Here's three ha' pence,
if that's any use to you.

23
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:30,780
Thank you, sir.

24
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:41,072
You be careful.
Better give 'im a flower for it.

25
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,123
There's a bloke here behind that pillar...

26
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,045
...takin' down every blessed word
you're sayin'.

27
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:52,219
I ain't done nothin' wrong
by speakin' to the gentleman.

28
00:06:52,302 --> 00:06:55,053
I've a right to sell flow'rs
if I keep off the curb.

29
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:57,296
I'm a respectable girl, so help me.

30
00:06:57,473 --> 00:07:00,975
I never spoke to him except to ask him
to buy a flow'r off me.

31
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:03,600
-What's the bloomin' noise?
-A tec's takin' her down.

32
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,517
I'm makin' an honest livin'.

33
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:07,601
Who's doing all that shouting?

34
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:12,363
Sir, don't let 'im charge me.
You dunno what it means to me.

35
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:15,449
They'll take away me character
and drive me on the streets...

36
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,194
...for speakin' to gentlemen.

37
00:07:17,286 --> 00:07:21,154
There, there. Who's hurting you,
you silly girl? What'd you take me for?

38
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:23,076
On my Bible oath, I never spoke a word.

39
00:07:23,168 --> 00:07:25,077
Shut up! Do I look like a policeman?

40
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,503
Why'd ya take down me words?
'Ow do I know you took me down right?

41
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,081
You just show me
what you wrote ab'ut me.

42
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,098
That ain't proper writin'. I can't read it.

43
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:42,135
I can.

44
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:46,272
'"l say, Capt'n,
now buy a flow'r off a poor girl.'"

45
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:52,062
Oh, it's cause I called him '"Capt'n.'"

46
00:07:52,657 --> 00:07:56,903
I meant no 'arm. Sir, don't let him lay
a charge against me for a word like that.

47
00:07:56,994 --> 00:08:00,411
I'll make no charge.
Really, sir, if you are a detective...

48
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:03,618
...you needn't protect me
against molestation from young women...

49
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:04,623
...until I ask you.

50
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,082
Anyone could tell the girl meant no harm.

51
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:10,255
He ain't no tec. He's a gentleman.
Look at his boots.

52
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:12,333
How are all your people down at Selsey?

53
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,917
Who told you my people
come from Selsey?

54
00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:16,554
Never mind, they do.

55
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,095
How do you come to be up so far east?
You were born in Lisson Grove.

56
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,429
What 'arm is there
in my leavin' Lisson Grove?

57
00:08:25,563 --> 00:08:28,766
It weren't fit for pigs to live.
I had to pay four and six a week.

58
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:30,602
Live where you like but stop that noise!

59
00:08:30,694 --> 00:08:34,228
Come, come, he can't touch you.
You've a right to live where you please.

60
00:08:34,322 --> 00:08:36,196
I'm a good girl, I am.

61
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:39,148
-Where do I come from?
-Hawkestone.

62
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,992
Who said I didn't?
Blimey, you know everything, you do.

63
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:45,248
You, sir, do you think
you could find me a taxi?

64
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:47,417
Madam, it's stopped raining.

65
00:08:47,503 --> 00:08:49,995
You can get a motorbus to Hampton Court.

66
00:08:50,632 --> 00:08:51,830
Isn't that where you live?

67
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:53,632
What impertinence!

68
00:08:54,093 --> 00:08:57,627
Tell 'im where he comes from,
if you wanta go fortune-telling.

69
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:02,553
Cheltenham, Harrow...

70
00:09:03,686 --> 00:09:05,559
...Cambridge and...

71
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:08,685
...lndia?

72
00:09:08,774 --> 00:09:09,972
Quite right.

73
00:09:10,318 --> 00:09:12,642
He ain't a tec, he's a bloomin' busybody.

74
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:15,571
Do you do this sort of thing
for a living at a music hall?

75
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,778
I have thought of it.
Perhaps I will one day.

76
00:09:17,866 --> 00:09:21,200
He's no gentleman, he ain't,
to interfere with a poor girl!

77
00:09:21,286 --> 00:09:22,994
How do you do it, may I ask?

78
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,955
Simple phonetics. The science of speech.
That's my profession. Also my hobby.

79
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:31,504
Anyone can spot an lrishman
or a Yorkshireman by his brogue...

80
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,713
...but I can place a man within six miles.

81
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,667
I can place 'im within two miles in London.
Sometimes within two streets.

82
00:09:37,762 --> 00:09:40,550
Ought to be ashamed of 'imself,
unmanly coward.

83
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,514
-Is there a living in that?
-Oh, yes.

84
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,934
Let him mind his own business
and leave a poor girl alone.

85
00:09:46,437 --> 00:09:49,010
Cease this detestable
boohooing instantly...

86
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:51,977
...or else seek the shelter
of some other place of worship!

87
00:09:52,777 --> 00:09:55,647
I have a right to be here if I like,
same as you!

88
00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:58,698
A woman who utters such disgusting,
depressing noises...

89
00:09:58,782 --> 00:10:01,321
...has no right to be anywhere,
no right to live.

90
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,201
Remember, you're a human with a soul...

91
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:05,956
...and the divine gift of articulate speech.

92
00:10:06,123 --> 00:10:09,123
Your native language is the language
of Shakespeare and...

93
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:13,373
...Milton and the Bible. Don't sit there
crooning like a bilious pigeon.

00:13:30,746 --> 00:13:34,744
Are you? Do you know Colonel Pickering,
the author of Spoken Sanskrit?

153
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:37,997
I am Colonel Pickering. Who are you?

154
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:41,256
I'm Henry Higgins,
author of Higgins' Universal Alphabet.

155
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:43,833
I came from lndia to meet you!

156
00:13:44,011 --> 00:13:46,169
I was going to lndia to meet you!

157
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,427
-Where are you staying?
-At the Carleton.

158
00:13:51,518 --> 00:13:54,353
No, you're not.
You're staying at 27A Wimpole Street.

159
00:13:54,438 --> 00:13:57,224
You come with me.
We'll have a little jaw over supper.

160
00:13:57,315 --> 00:13:59,307
Indian dialects have always fascinated me.

161
00:13:59,401 --> 00:14:01,228
Buy a flower. I'm short for me lodgin'.

162
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:02,268
Liar!

163
00:14:02,362 --> 00:14:04,734
You said you could change half a crown.

164
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:08,357
You ought to be stuffed with nails,
you ought!

165
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:11,905
Here, take the whole bloomin' basket
for a sixpence!

166
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:16,661
A reminder.

167
00:14:21,214 --> 00:14:23,420
-How many are there actually?
-How many what?

168
00:14:23,507 --> 00:14:24,503
Indian dialects?

169
00:14:24,592 --> 00:14:28,920
No fewer than 147 distinct languages
are recorded as vernacular in lndia.

170
00:14:38,273 --> 00:14:42,520
Shouldn't we stand up, gentlemen?
We've got a bloomin' heiress in our midst.

171
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:45,270
Would you be lookin'
for a good butler, Eliza?

172
00:14:45,364 --> 00:14:47,023
Well, you won't do.

It's nearly 5:00.
My daughter Eliza'll be along soon.

She ought to be good for 'alf a crown
for a father that loves 'er.

That's a laugh.
You ain't been near 'er for months.

What's that got to do with it?
What's 'alf a crown after all I've give 'er?

00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:02,804
When did you ever give 'er anythin'?

229
00:20:02,891 --> 00:20:05,050
Anythin'? I give 'er everythin'.

230
00:20:05,143 --> 00:20:08,928
I give 'er the greatest gift
any human being can give to another:

Life!

232

I introduced 'er to this here planet, I did,
with all its wonders and marvels.

233
00:20:14,986 --> 00:20:17,524
The sun that shines, the moon that glows.

234
00:20:17,739 --> 00:20:20,612
Hyde Park to walk through
on a fine spring night.

235
00:20:20,994 --> 00:20:25,323
The 'ole ruddy city o' London to roam
around in sellin' 'er bloomin' flow'rs.

236
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,034
I give 'er all that.

237
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:30,705
Then I disappears and leaves 'er
on 'er own to enjoy it.

238
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,084
If that ain't worth 'alf a crown
now and again...

239

...l'll take my belt off and give 'er what for.

242

Why, Liza, what a surprise.

247

Hop along, Charlie, you're too old for me.

248
00:22:32,626 --> 00:22:35,543
-Don't you know your daughter?
-You don't know what she looks like.

249
00:22:35,629 --> 00:22:38,464
I know 'er, I know 'er.
Come on, I'll find 'er.

250
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,413

251
00:23:09,497 --> 00:23:11,075
Not a brass farthin'.

252
00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:13,455
Hey, you come 'ere, Eliza.

253
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:15,909

...without a drop o' liquid protection,
would ya?

258
00:23:34,605 --> 00:23:37,724
Well, I'm willin' to marry 'er.
It's me that suffers by it.

259
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,894
I'm a slave to that woman, Eliza.

260
00:23:39,987 --> 00:23:42,941
Just because I ain't 'er lawful 'usband.

261
00:23:43,157 --> 00:23:44,188
Come on.

262

to go 'ome on.

264

But don't keep comin' around
countin' on 'alf crowns from me!

265
00:23:57,962 --> 00:24:00,964
Thank you, Eliza. You're a noble daughter.

266

...that will keep her
in the gutter till the end of her days?

270
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:41,245
In six months, I could pass her off
as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.

271
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:44,544
I could get her ajob as a lady's maid
or a shop assistant...

272

...which requires better English.

How many vowel sounds
did you hear altogether?

277
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:40,313
I believe I counted 24.

278
00:25:40,441 --> 00:25:43,525
Wrong by 100. To be exact you heard 130.

279
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,735
Listen to them one at a time.

280

My name is of no concern to you
whatsoever.

One moment, please.

285
00:26:30,408 --> 00:26:33,029
London is gettin' so dirty these days.

286
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:36,821
I'm Mrs. Pearce, the housekeeper.
Can I help you?

287
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,699
Good morning, missus.
I'd like to see the professor, please.

288
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:42,412
Could you tell me what it's about?

289
00:26:42,502 --> 00:26:45,289
It's business of a personal nature.

290
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,835
One moment, please.

291
00:26:58,438 --> 00:27:01,107
-Mr. Higgins?
-What is it, Mrs. Pearce?

292
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,728
There's a young woman
who wants to see you, sir.

293
00:27:03,817 --> 00:27:05,015
A young woman?

294
00:27:06,195 --> 00:27:07,190
What does she want?

295
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,031
She's quite a common girl, sir.
Very common indeed.

296
00:27:10,116 --> 00:27:12,155
I should've sent her away, only I thought...

297
00:27:12,242 --> 00:27:14,235
...you wanted her to talk
into your machine.

298
00:27:14,328 --> 00:27:17,114
-Has she an interesting accent?
-Simply ghastly.

299
00:27:17,205 --> 00:27:20,207
Good. Let's have her in.
Show her in, Mrs. Pearce.

300
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:24,452
This is rather a bit of luck.
I'll show you how I make records.

301
00:27:24,546 --> 00:27:28,461
We'll set her talking, then I'll take
her down first in Bell's Visible Speech...

302
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:31,716
...then in broad Romic.
Then we'll get her on the phonograph...

303
00:27:31,803 --> 00:27:36,215
...so you can turn her on when you want
with the written transcript before you.

304
00:27:39,477 --> 00:27:41,268
This is the young woman, sir.

305
00:27:41,354 --> 00:27:42,634
Good mornin', my good man.

306
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,639
Might I 'ave a word with you?

307
00:27:44,732 --> 00:27:47,223
Oh, no. This is the girl
I jotted down last night.

308
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:50,570
She's no use. I got the records I want
of the Lisson Grove lingo.

309
00:27:50,657 --> 00:27:52,566
I won't waste another cylinder on that.

310
00:27:52,658 --> 00:27:54,283
Be off with you. I don't want you.

311
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:57,534
Don't be so saucy.
You ain't 'eard what I come for yet.

312
00:27:57,704 --> 00:27:59,497
Did you tell 'im I come in a taxi?

313
00:27:59,582 --> 00:28:02,618
Nonsense. Do you think a gentleman
like Mr. Higgins cares...

314
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,872
...what you came in?

315
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:05,538
Oh, we are proud.

316
00:28:05,712 --> 00:28:08,963
He ain't above givin' lessons, not 'im.
I 'eard 'im say so.

317
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,125
I ain't come here to ask
for any compliment...

318
00:28:11,218 --> 00:28:13,969
...and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.

319
00:28:14,054 --> 00:28:15,512
Good enough for what?

320
00:28:15,597 --> 00:28:17,340
Good enough for you.

321
00:28:18,475 --> 00:28:21,310
Now you know, don't ya?
I'm come to 'ave lessons.

322
00:28:21,395 --> 00:28:23,932
And to pay for 'em, too, make no mistake.

323
00:28:24,063 --> 00:28:25,059
Well!

324
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:28,395
And what do you expect me to say?

325
00:28:29,194 --> 00:28:32,693
Well, if you was a gentleman,
you might ask me to sit down, I think.

326
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,485
Don't I tell you I'm bringin' you business?

327
00:28:36,242 --> 00:28:38,202
Should we ask this baggage to sit down...

328
00:28:38,288 --> 00:28:40,695
...or shall we just throw her
out of the window?

329
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,834
I won't be called a baggage.
Not when I've offered to pay like any lady.

330
00:28:46,045 --> 00:28:47,837
What do you want, my girl?

331
00:28:51,968 --> 00:28:53,794
I want to be a lady in a flow'r shop...

332
00:28:53,886 --> 00:28:56,721
...'stead of sellin' at the corner
of Tottenham Court Road.

333
00:28:56,805 --> 00:28:59,557
But they won't take me
unless I can talk more genteel.

334
00:28:59,642 --> 00:29:00,922
He said 'e could teach me.

335
00:29:01,018 --> 00:29:03,094
Well, 'ere I am ready to pay 'im.

336
00:29:03,187 --> 00:29:06,436
Not asking any favor
and he treats me as if I was dirt.

337
00:29:07,107 --> 00:29:10,975
I know what lessons cost as well as you do
and I'm ready to pay.

338
00:29:13,947 --> 00:29:15,275
How much?

339
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,448
Now you're talkin'.

340
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:20,197
I thought you'd come off it
for a chance to get back...

341
00:29:20,287 --> 00:29:22,409
...a bit of what you chucked
at me last night.

342
00:29:22,497 --> 00:29:24,205
You'd had a drop in, 'adn't you?

343
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,488
Sit down.

344
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:28,830
-If you're goin' t' make a compliment of it--
-Sit down!

345
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:32,004
Sit down, girl. Do as you're told.

346
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,926
What's your name?

347
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:35,961
Eliza Doolittle.

348
00:29:36,637 --> 00:29:39,093
Won't you sit down, Miss Doolittle?

349
00:29:42,977 --> 00:29:44,554
I don't mind if I do.

350
00:29:48,107 --> 00:29:51,227
How much do you propose
to pay me for these lessons?

351
00:29:51,444 --> 00:29:52,938
Oh, I know what's right.

352
00:29:53,028 --> 00:29:55,899
My lady friend gets French lessons
for 18 pence an hour...

353
00:29:55,989 --> 00:29:57,899
...from a real French gentleman.

354
00:29:57,992 --> 00:30:00,317
You wouldn't have the face
to ask me the same...

355
00:30:00,411 --> 00:30:03,246
...for teachin' me my own language
as you would for French.

356
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:06,699
I won't give more than a shillin'.
Take it or leave it.

357
00:30:08,836 --> 00:30:11,920
Do you know, Pickering,
if you think of a shilling...

358
00:30:12,172 --> 00:30:16,252
...not as a simple shilling,
but as a percentage of this girl's income...

359
00:30:16,592 --> 00:30:19,300
...it works out as fully equivalent of...

360
00:30:21,016 --> 00:30:23,471
...60 or 70 pounds from a millionaire.

361
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:27,727
By George, it's enormous.
It's the biggest offer I ever had.

362
00:30:27,814 --> 00:30:32,025
Sixty pounds? What are you talkin' about?
Where would I get 60 pounds?

363
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,482
-I never offered you 60 pounds!
-Hold your tongue!

364
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,195
But I ain't got 60 pounds!

365
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,065
Don't cry, silly girl. Sit down.
Nobody's going to touch your money.

366
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,493
Somebody'll touch you with a broomstick
if you don't stop sniveling.

367
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:44,742
Sit down!

368
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:51,247
Anybody'd think you was my father!

369
00:30:51,379 --> 00:30:54,996
If I decide to teach you,
I'll be worse than two fathers to you.

370
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:56,795
Here.

371
00:30:57,092 --> 00:30:58,124
What's this for?

372
00:30:58,219 --> 00:31:02,002
To wipe your eyes. To wipe any part
of your face that feels moist.

373
00:31:02,222 --> 00:31:05,057
Remember, that's your handkerchief
and that's your sleeve.

374
00:31:05,141 --> 00:31:08,727
Don't confuse one with the other,
if you want to become a lady in a shop.

375
00:31:08,814 --> 00:31:12,646
It's no use to talk to her like that.
She doesn't understand you.

376
00:31:12,734 --> 00:31:16,352
Give the 'andkerchief to me.
He give it to me, not to you!

377
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:18,523
Higgins, I'm interested.

378
00:31:18,699 --> 00:31:19,979
What about your boast...

379
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:22,945
...you could pass her off as a duchess
at the Embassy Ball?

380
00:31:23,036 --> 00:31:25,871
I'll say you're the greatest teacher alive
if you do that.

381
00:31:25,955 --> 00:31:30,084
I'll bet you all the expenses
of the experiment that you can't do it.

382
00:31:30,293 --> 00:31:32,001
I'll even pay for the lessons.

383
00:31:32,086 --> 00:31:34,791
You're real good. Thank ye, Capt'n.

384
00:31:36,215 --> 00:31:38,173
It's almost irresistible.

385
00:31:40,887 --> 00:31:43,175
She's so deliciously low.

386
00:31:43,264 --> 00:31:44,806
So horribly dirty.

387
00:31:44,932 --> 00:31:48,467
I ain't dirty! I washed my face an' hands
before I come, I did.

388
00:31:48,561 --> 00:31:52,511
I'll take it. I'll make a duchess
of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

389
00:31:52,899 --> 00:31:56,433
We'll start today. This moment.
Take her away and clean her.

390
00:31:56,527 --> 00:31:59,946
Sandpaper, if it won't come off.
Is there a fire in the kitchen?

391
00:32:00,033 --> 00:32:03,069
Take her clothes off and burn them
and order some new ones.

392
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:05,782
Just wrap her in brown paper
till they come.

393
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:09,872
You're no gentleman, you're not,
to talk o' such things.

394
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,454
I'm a good girl, I am.

395
00:32:11,544 --> 00:32:14,331
And I know what the likes of you are, I do.

396
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:18,209
We want none of your slum prudery here,
young woman.

397
00:32:18,468 --> 00:32:20,709
You've got to learn to behave
like a duchess.

398
00:32:20,803 --> 00:32:24,254
Take her away, Mrs. Pearce.
If she gives you any trouble, wallop her.

399
00:32:24,348 --> 00:32:26,175
I'll call the police, I will.

400
00:32:26,266 --> 00:32:27,892
I've got no place to put her.

401
00:32:27,977 --> 00:32:29,934
Well, put her in the dustbin.

402
00:32:30,896 --> 00:32:32,889
Come, Higgins, be reasonable.

403
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:35,554
You must be reasonable,
Mr. Higgins, you must.

404
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:38,142
You can't walk over everybody like this.

405
00:32:40,906 --> 00:32:41,937
I?

406
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:44,532
Walk over everybody?

407
00:32:44,617 --> 00:32:48,783
My dear Mrs. Pearce, my dear Pickering,
I had no intention of walking over anybody.

408
00:32:48,874 --> 00:32:52,040
I merely suggested we should be kind
to this poor girl.

409
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:56,711
I didn't express myself clearly
because I didn't wish to hurt her delicacy...

410
00:32:57,131 --> 00:32:58,247
...or yours.

411
00:32:58,342 --> 00:33:01,426
But, sir, you can't take a girl up like that...

412
00:33:01,594 --> 00:33:04,215
...as if you were picking up
a pebble on the beach.

413
00:33:04,305 --> 00:33:05,468
Why not?

414
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,427
Why not? But you don't know
anything about her.

415
00:33:08,518 --> 00:33:11,305
What about her parents?
She may be married.

416
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:12,766
Garn!

417
00:33:13,105 --> 00:33:16,189
There. As the girl
very properly says, '"garn! '"

418
00:33:16,984 --> 00:33:18,645
Who'd marry me?

419
00:33:21,072 --> 00:33:22,863
By George, Eliza...

420
00:33:23,657 --> 00:33:27,073
...the streets will be strewn
with the bodies of men...

421
00:33:27,244 --> 00:33:30,827
...shooting themselves for your sake
before I'm done with you.

422
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:34,621
I'm goin'.

423
00:33:34,918 --> 00:33:38,455
He's off his chump, he is.
I don't want no balmies teachin' me.

424
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:41,715
Mad? All right, Mrs. Pearce,
don't order those new clothes.

425
00:33:41,802 --> 00:33:44,008
-Throw her out.
-Stop! I won't allow it.

426
00:33:44,096 --> 00:33:45,590
Go home to your parents, girl.

427
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,424
I ain't got no parents.

428
00:33:47,641 --> 00:33:49,550
She ain't got no parents. What's the fuss?

429
00:33:49,643 --> 00:33:53,058
Nobody wants her. She's no use
to anyone but me. Take her upstairs!

430
00:33:53,146 --> 00:33:55,601
What's to become of her?
ls she to be paid anything?

431
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,267
Do be sensible, sir.

432
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:00,058
What'd she do with money?
She'll have food and clothes.

433
00:34:00,153 --> 00:34:01,731
She'll drink if you give her money.

434
00:34:01,821 --> 00:34:03,564
You are a brute! It's a lie!

435
00:34:03,656 --> 00:34:06,147
Nobody ever saw the sign o' liquor on me.

436
00:34:06,242 --> 00:34:09,327
Sir, you're a gentleman.
Don't let 'im speak to me like that!

437
00:34:09,412 --> 00:34:12,615
Does it occur to you, Higgins,
the girl has some feelings?

438
00:34:12,707 --> 00:34:15,826
No, I don't think so.
No feelings we need worry about.

439
00:34:16,043 --> 00:34:17,122
Well, have you, Eliza?

440
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:19,536
I got me feelings same as anyone else.

441
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:22,915
Mr. Higgins, I must know on what terms
the girl is to be here.

442
00:34:23,008 --> 00:34:25,415
What'll become of her
when you've finished teaching?

443
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,340
You must look ahead a little, sir.

444
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:30,681
What'll become of her if we leave her
in the gutter, Mrs. Pearce?

445
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:33,093
That's her own business,
not yours, Mr. Higgins.

446
00:34:33,187 --> 00:34:34,729
When I'm done, we'll throw her back.

447
00:34:34,813 --> 00:34:38,147
Then it'll be her own business again.
That'll be all right, won't it?

448
00:34:38,234 --> 00:34:40,559
You've no feelin' 'eart in ya!

449
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:43,560
You don't care for nothin' but yourself.

450
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,986
I've 'ad enough of this. I'm goin'!

451
00:34:46,074 --> 00:34:48,114
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!

452
00:34:48,202 --> 00:34:50,111
Have some chocolates, Eliza.

453
00:34:56,876 --> 00:34:58,585
'Ow do I know what might be in 'em?

454
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,789
I've 'eard of girls bein' drugged
by the likes o' you.

455
00:35:02,173 --> 00:35:03,750
Pledge of good faith.

456
00:35:04,425 --> 00:35:05,967
I'll take one half.

457
00:35:06,844 --> 00:35:08,552
And you take the other.

458
00:35:12,016 --> 00:35:15,100
You'll have boxes of them,
barrels of them every day.

459
00:35:15,477 --> 00:35:17,188
You'll live on them, eh?

460
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:22,184
I wouldn't 've ate it, only I'm too ladylike
to take it out o' me mouth.

461
00:35:22,278 --> 00:35:25,777
Think of it, Eliza.
Think of chocolates, and taxis...

462
00:35:26,114 --> 00:35:28,487
...and gold and diamonds.

463
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:33,617
I don't want no gold and no diamonds.
I'm a good girl, I am.

464
00:35:33,997 --> 00:35:37,283
Higgins, I really must interfere.
Mrs. Pearce is quite right.

465
00:35:37,376 --> 00:35:40,377
If this girl will put herself
in your hands for six months...

466
00:35:40,462 --> 00:35:45,005
...for an experiment in teaching, she must
understand thoroughly what she's doing.

467
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:51,260
You are to stay here
for the next six months...

468
00:35:51,348 --> 00:35:55,345
...learning how to speak beautifully
like a lady in a florist shop.

469
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,261
If you're good and do what you're told,
you'll sleep in a proper bedroom...

470
00:36:00,356 --> 00:36:04,650
...have lots to eat, money
to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis.

471
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:08,194
But if you are naughty and idle...

472
00:36:08,283 --> 00:36:11,118
...you'll sleep in the kitchen
amongst the black beetles...

473
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:14,238
...and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce
with a broomstick.

474
00:36:15,581 --> 00:36:19,413
At the end of six months,
you shall be taken to Buckingham Palace...

475
00:36:19,752 --> 00:36:22,159
...in a carriage, beautifully dressed.

476
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,334
If the king finds out
that you are not a lady...

477
00:36:26,508 --> 00:36:30,755
...the police will take you to the Tower
of London where your head will be cut off...

478
00:36:30,846 --> 00:36:33,847
...as a warning to other
presumptuous flower girls.

479
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:38,301
But if you are not found out,
you shall have a present of...

480
00:36:39,396 --> 00:36:42,599
...seven and six to start life with
as a lady in a shop.

481
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,858
If you refuse this offer...

482
00:36:45,944 --> 00:36:49,895
...you will be the most ungrateful,
wicked girl...

483
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:53,942
...and the angels will weep for you!

484
00:36:59,043 --> 00:37:00,418
Are you satisfied, Pickering?

485
00:37:00,503 --> 00:37:02,578
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

486
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:05,127
Could I put it more plainly or fairly,
Mrs. Pearce?

487
00:37:05,215 --> 00:37:06,128
Come with me.

488
00:37:06,216 --> 00:37:08,968
That's right.
Bundle her off to the bathroom.

489
00:37:09,053 --> 00:37:10,962
You're a great bully, you are!

490
00:37:11,055 --> 00:37:14,304
I won't stay here if I don't like it.
I won't let nobody wallop me!

491
00:37:14,391 --> 00:37:16,098
Don't answer back, girl.

492
00:37:17,728 --> 00:37:20,053
I've always been a good girl, I 'ave.

493
00:37:21,231 --> 00:37:24,481
In six months...in three,
if she has a good ear and a quick tongue...

494
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:27,320
...l'll take her anywhere
and I'll pass her off as anything.

495
00:37:27,404 --> 00:37:30,073
I'll make a queen of that barbarous wretch!

496
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:40,490
I've never had a bath in me life.
Not what you'd call a proper one.

497
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:44,248
You know you can't be a nice girl inside
if you're dirty outside.

498
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,126
I'll have to put you in here.
This will be your bedroom.

499
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:54,171
I couldn't sleep in here, missus.

500
00:37:54,265 --> 00:37:56,423
It's too good for the likes o' me.

501
00:37:58,394 --> 00:38:00,470
I should be afraid to touch anythin'.

502
00:38:00,563 --> 00:38:02,638
I ain't a duchess yet, you know.

503
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:11,645
What's this?
This where you wash clothes?

504
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:15,784
This is where we wash ourselves, Eliza.
And where I'm going to wash you.

505
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:19,573
You expect me to get into that
and wet meself all over?

506
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:20,779
Not me!

507
00:38:27,255 --> 00:38:29,082
I shall catch me death.

508
00:38:31,592 --> 00:38:32,873
Come along now.

509
00:38:33,469 --> 00:38:34,632
Come along.

510
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,803
Take your clothes off.

511
00:38:37,934 --> 00:38:40,769
Come on, girl, do as you're told.
Take your clothes off.

512
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:43,225
Here, come on. Help me take these--

513
00:38:49,779 --> 00:38:51,937
Take your hands off me!

514
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:14,800
I'm a good girl, I am!

515
00:39:17,306 --> 00:39:20,176
It ain't right! It ain't decent!

516
00:39:26,522 --> 00:39:28,185
Get your hands off me!

517
00:39:36,158 --> 00:39:37,986
I'm a good girl, I am!

518
00:39:51,882 --> 00:39:54,717
Forgive the bluntness,
but if I'm to be in this business...

519
00:39:54,801 --> 00:39:56,711
...l shall feel responsible for the girl.

520
00:39:56,804 --> 00:40:00,753
I hope it's clearly understood that
no advantage is to be taken of her position.

521
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:03,518
What, that thing? Sacred, I assure you.

522
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:06,602
Come now, you know what I mean.
This is no trifling matter.

523
00:40:06,689 --> 00:40:10,140
Are you a man of good character
where women are concerned?

524
00:40:11,151 --> 00:40:14,436
Have you ever met a man of good
character where women are concerned?

525
00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:16,521
Yes, very frequently.

526
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,033
I haven't. The moment I let a woman
make friends with me...

527
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,408
...she becomes jealous, exacting...

528
00:40:22,497 --> 00:40:24,739
...suspicious and a damned nuisance.

529
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:29,128
The moment that I make friends with
a woman I become selfish and tyrannical.

530
00:40:29,212 --> 00:40:32,794
So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor
and likely to remain so.

531
00:40:33,049 --> 00:40:35,041
Well, after all, Pickering....

532
00:40:35,551 --> 00:40:37,260
'"l'm an ordinary man

610
00:45:04,572 --> 00:45:08,273
Work! Don't you dare mention
that word in my presence again.

611
00:45:08,618 --> 00:45:11,239
Look at all these poor blighters down here.

612
00:45:12,121 --> 00:45:15,324
I used to do that sort of thing once.
Just for exercise.

613
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:18,588
It's not worth it. Takes up your whole day.

614
00:45:18,963 --> 00:45:21,584
Don't worry, boys.
We'll get outta this somehow.

615
00:45:21,674 --> 00:45:23,583
How do you think you'll do that?

616
00:45:23,675 --> 00:45:25,798
How? Same as always.

617
00:45:26,011 --> 00:45:28,384
Faith, hope and a little bit o' luck.

618

The Honorable Alfie Doolittle.

657
00:48:05,255 --> 00:48:07,165
What are you doing in Eliza's house?

658
00:48:07,258 --> 00:48:09,629
Her former residence!

659
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:12,465
You can buy your own drinks now,
Alfie Doolittle.

660
00:48:12,554 --> 00:48:14,511
Fallen into a tub of butter, you have.

661
00:48:14,597 --> 00:48:15,879
What are you talkin' about?

662
00:48:15,974 --> 00:48:17,255
Your daughter, Eliza.

663
00:48:17,351 --> 00:48:19,806
You're a lucky man, Alfie Doolittle.

664
00:48:19,936 --> 00:48:21,311
What about Eliza?

665
00:48:22,355 --> 00:48:25,355
He don't know.
Her own father an' he don't know.

666
00:48:29,571 --> 00:48:31,729
Moved in with a swell, Eliza has.

667
00:48:31,823 --> 00:48:34,823
Left here in a taxi all by herself,
smart as paint.

668
00:48:35,075 --> 00:48:37,236
An' ain't been home for three days.

669
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:38,196
Go on.

670
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:40,496
And this mornin' I gets a message from 'er.

671
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:42,789
She wants her things sent over...

672
00:48:43,044 --> 00:48:45,962
...to 27A Wimpole Street...

673
00:48:46,297 --> 00:48:48,373
...care of Professor Higgins.

674
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,793
An' what things does she want?

675
00:48:52,344 --> 00:48:56,425
Her birdcage and her Chinese fan.

676
00:48:58,767 --> 00:49:00,048
But she says:

677
00:49:00,561 --> 00:49:03,846
'"Never mind about sending any clothes.'"

678
00:49:07,484 --> 00:49:10,236
I knew she had a career in front of 'er.

679
00:49:10,487 --> 00:49:12,942
We're in for a booze-up.

680
00:49:13,031 --> 00:49:15,985
The sun is shining on Alfred P. Doolittle.

Pay the bills and say no to the invitations.

703
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:41,216
You simply cannot go on
working the girl this way.

704
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,594
Making her say her alphabet
over and over...

...from sunup to sundown,
even during meals.

706

You'll exhaust yourself. When will it stop?

707
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:52,855
When she does it properly, of course.
Is that all, Mrs. Pearce?

708
00:51:52,942 --> 00:51:56,444
There's another letter from the
American millionaire, Ezra D. Wallingford.

709
00:51:56,532 --> 00:51:58,738
He still wants you
for his Moral Reform League.

710
00:51:58,825 --> 00:51:59,904
Throw it away.

711
00:51:59,993 --> 00:52:03,492
It's the third letter he's written you.
You should at least answer it.

712
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:07,494
All right, leave it on the desk, Mrs. Pearce.
I'll try and get to it.

713
00:52:09,669 --> 00:52:13,713
If you please, sir. There's a dustman
downstairs, Alfred P. Doolittle...

714
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,841
...who wants to see you.
He says you have his daughter here.

715
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:18,171
I say!

716
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:21,344
Well, send the blackguard up.

717
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,429
He may not be a blackguard, Higgins.

718
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:26,185
Nonsense. Of course
he's a blackguard, Pickering.

719
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:28,640
I'm afraid we'll have some trouble
with him.

720
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:33,225
No, I think not. Any trouble to be had,
he'll have it with me. Not I with him.

721

Doolittle, sir.

-Professor Higgins?
-Here!

723
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:48,614
Where?

724
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:51,041
Good morning, Governor.

725
00:52:51,461 --> 00:52:54,497
I come about a very serious matter,
Governor.

726
00:52:58,009 --> 00:53:00,049
Brought up in Houndslow.

727
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,677
Mother Welsh, I should think.

728
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,258
What is it you want, Doolittle?

729
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:07,888
I want my daughter, that's what I want.
See?

730
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:10,468
Of course you do.
You're her father, aren't you?

731
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:13,184
I'm glad to see you have a spark
of family feeling left.

732
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:15,896
She's in there. Yes, take her away at once.

733
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:17,100
What?

734
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:21,603
Take her away. Do you think I am going
to keep your daughter for you?

735
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,492
Now, is this reasonable, Governor?

736
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:27,696
Is it fairity to take advantage
of a man like that?

737
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,121
The girl belongs to me. You got 'er.
Where do I come in?

738
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:35,251
How dare you come here
and attempt to blackmail me!

739
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,797
You sent her here on purpose!

740
00:53:37,925 --> 00:53:41,210
Don't take a man up like that, Governor.

741
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:43,544
The police shall take you up.
This is a plan...

742
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:46,011
...a plot to extort money by threats.

743
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,056
I shall telephone the police.

744
00:53:48,185 --> 00:53:51,185
Have I asked you for a brass farthin'?

745
00:53:51,688 --> 00:53:55,271
I leave it to this gentleman 'ere.
Have I said a word about money?

746
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:57,517
Well, what else did you come for?

747
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:01,396
What would a bloke come for?

748
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:03,690
Be 'uman, Governor.

749
00:54:08,788 --> 00:54:11,741
Alfred, you sent her here on purpose.

750
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:13,534
So help me, Governor, I never did.

751
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,036
How did you know she was here?

752
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:17,998
I'd tell you, Governor,
if you'd let me get a word in.

753
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:20,959
I'm willing to tell ya.
I'm wanting to tell ya.

754
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,007
I'm waiting to tell ya!

755
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:28,766
You know, Pickering, this chap's got
a certain natural gift of rhetoric.

756
00:54:28,976 --> 00:54:31,893
Observe the rhythm
of his native woodnotes wild.

757
00:54:32,145 --> 00:54:36,096
'"l'm willing to tell you. I'm wanting
to tell you. I'm waiting to tell you.'"

758
00:54:36,192 --> 00:54:38,350
That's the Welsh strain in 'im.

759
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:41,231
How did you know Eliza was here
if you didn't send 'er?

760
00:54:41,321 --> 00:54:44,820
Well, she sent back for her luggage
and I got to 'ear about it.

761
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:47,613
She said she didn't want no clothes.

762
00:54:48,245 --> 00:54:52,906
What was I to think from that, Governor?
I ask you, as a parent, what was I to think?

763
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:57,123
So you came here to rescue her
from worse than death, eh?

764
00:54:57,462 --> 00:54:59,953
-Yes, sir, Governor. That's right.
-Yes.

765
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:01,750
Mrs. Pearce!

766
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:06,627
Eliza's father has come to take her away.
Give her to him, will you?

767
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:10,136
Now wait a minute, Governor.
Wait a minute.

768
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,769
You and me is men o' the world, ain't we?

769
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:18,352
Men of the world, are we?
Perhaps you'd better go, Mrs. Pearce.

770
00:55:18,442 --> 00:55:20,150
I think so indeed, sir!

771
00:55:20,569 --> 00:55:21,850
Here, Governor.

772
00:55:22,279 --> 00:55:25,197
I've took a sort of a fancy to you and...

773
00:55:28,535 --> 00:55:31,904
...if you want the girl, I ain't so set
on 'avin' her home again...

774
00:55:31,997 --> 00:55:34,914
...but what I might be open to
is an arrangement.

775
00:55:35,334 --> 00:55:37,741
All I ask is my rights as a father.

776
00:55:37,836 --> 00:55:41,501
You're the last man alive to expect me
to let her go for nothing.

777
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,090
I can see you're a straight sort, Governor.

778
00:55:45,177 --> 00:55:46,208
So...

779
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:50,253
...what's a five pound note to you?
An' what's Eliza to me?

780
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:52,598
I think you should know, Doolittle...

781
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,851
...that Mr. Higgins' intentions
are entirely honorable.

782
00:55:56,229 --> 00:56:00,061
Of course they are, Governor.
If I thought they wasn't, I'd ask 50.

783
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:03,401
You mean, you'd sell your daughter
for 50 pounds?

784
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,232
Have you no morals, man?

785
00:56:08,242 --> 00:56:12,322
No, I can't afford 'em, Governor. Neither
could you if you was as poor as me.

786
00:56:12,413 --> 00:56:14,619
Not that I mean any 'arm, but...

787
00:56:14,706 --> 00:56:18,207
...if Eliza is gonna have a bit out o' this,
why not me, too?

788
00:56:19,504 --> 00:56:20,583
Why not?

789
00:56:23,508 --> 00:56:25,999
Look at it my way. What am l?

790
00:56:27,012 --> 00:56:31,091
I ask ya, what am l? I'm one
o' the undeserving poor, that's what I am.

791
00:56:31,182 --> 00:56:33,221
Think what that means to a man.

792
00:56:33,309 --> 00:56:37,010
It means he's up against
middle-class morality for all the time.

793
00:56:37,605 --> 00:56:41,554
If there's anything goin' an' I ask
for a bit of it, it's always the same story:

794
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:44,271
'"You're undeservin', so you can't have it.'"

795
00:56:44,444 --> 00:56:48,443
But my needs is as great as the most
deservin' widows that ever got money...

796
00:56:48,532 --> 00:56:53,028
...out of six different charities in one week
for the death o' the same 'usband.

797
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:56,622
I don't need less than a deservin' man,
I need more.

798
00:56:57,084 --> 00:57:00,085
I don't eat less 'earty than he does
and I drink...

799
00:57:00,879 --> 00:57:02,124
...a lot more.

800
00:57:02,422 --> 00:57:04,415
I'm playin' straight with you.

801
00:57:04,508 --> 00:57:08,209
I ain't pretendin' to be deservin'.
No, I'm undeservin'...

802
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,765
...and I mean to go on bein' undeservin'.
I like it an' that's the truth.

803
00:57:12,849 --> 00:57:16,432
But will you take advantage
of a man's nature...

804
00:57:16,687 --> 00:57:20,138
...do him out of the price of
his own daughter, what he's brought up...

805
00:57:20,231 --> 00:57:22,936
...fed and clothed
by the sweat of his brow...

806
00:57:23,651 --> 00:57:28,313
...till she's growed big enough
to be interestin' to you two gentlemen?

807
00:57:30,241 --> 00:57:33,574
Is five pounds unreasonable,
I put it to you?

808
00:57:33,953 --> 00:57:35,578
And I leave it to you.

809
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:41,998
You know, Pickering, if we took this man
in hand for three months...

810
00:57:42,086 --> 00:57:46,501
...he could choose between a seat in
the Cabinet and a popular pulpit in Wales.

811
00:57:46,926 --> 00:57:50,674
-We'd better give 'im a fiver.
-He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid.

812
00:57:50,763 --> 00:57:52,802
Not me, Governor, so 'elp me I won't.

813
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:55,381
Just one good spree
for meself an' the missus...

814
00:57:55,476 --> 00:57:58,560
...givin' pleasure to ourselves
and employment to others.

815
00:57:58,646 --> 00:58:01,516
An' satisfaction to you to know
it ain't been throwed away.

816
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:03,266
You couldn't spend it better.

817
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:06,110
This is irresistible. Let's give 'im ten.

818
00:58:06,487 --> 00:58:08,693
The missus wouldn't have the 'eart
to spend ten.

819
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,488
Ten pounds is a lot o' money.

820
00:58:10,574 --> 00:58:14,108
Makes a man feel prudent-like,
and then goodbye to 'appiness.

821
00:58:14,535 --> 00:58:18,581
No, you just give me what I ask, Governor.
Not a penny less, not a penny more.

822
00:58:18,665 --> 00:58:21,998
I rather draw the line at encouraging
this sort of immorality.

823
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:24,160
Why don't you marry that missus of yours?

824
00:58:24,253 --> 00:58:27,670
After all, marriage isn't so frightening.
You married Eliza's mother.

825
00:58:27,757 --> 00:58:29,381
Who told you that, Governor?

826
00:58:29,467 --> 00:58:32,302
Well, nobody told me.
I concluded, naturally....

827
00:58:36,226 --> 00:58:39,760
If we listen to this man for another minute
we'll have no convictions left.

828
00:58:39,854 --> 00:58:42,689
-Five pounds, I think you said.
-Thank you, Governor.

829
00:58:42,773 --> 00:58:44,148
Are you sure you won't have ten?

830
00:58:44,233 --> 00:58:46,522
No. No, perhaps another time.

831
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:49,732
I beg your pardon, miss.

832
00:58:49,822 --> 00:58:52,573
I won't say those ruddy vowels
one more time.

833
00:58:52,658 --> 00:58:54,317
Blimey, it's Eliza.

834
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:57,192
I never thought she'd clean up
so good-looking.

835
00:58:57,288 --> 00:58:59,280
She does me credit, don't she?

836
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:01,910
What are you doin' here?

837
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,461
Now, you hold your tongue and don't
you give these gentlemen none o' your lip.

838
00:59:07,005 --> 00:59:10,338
If you have any trouble with 'er,
give 'er a few licks o' the strap.

839
00:59:10,425 --> 00:59:12,713
That's the way to improve 'er mind.

840
00:59:13,011 --> 00:59:15,716
Well, good morning, gentlemen.
Cheerio, Eliza.

841
00:59:19,392 --> 00:59:23,092
There's a man for you.
A philosophical genius of the first water.

842
00:59:24,691 --> 00:59:26,933
Write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford
and tell him...

843
00:59:27,027 --> 00:59:30,360
...if he wants a lecturer, to get in touch
with Mr. Doolittle...

844
00:59:30,446 --> 00:59:34,230
...a common dustman, one of
the most original moralists in England.

845
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:36,325
What did he come for?

846
00:59:36,578 --> 00:59:37,609
Say your vowels.

847
00:59:37,704 --> 00:59:39,743
I know me vowels.
I knew 'em before I come.

848
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,111
If you know them, say them.

849
00:59:41,207 --> 00:59:44,291
Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.

850
00:59:45,295 --> 00:59:47,536
A, E, l, O, U.

851
00:59:48,005 --> 00:59:50,922
That's what I said. Ahyee, e, iyee, ow, you.

852
00:59:51,008 --> 00:59:53,843
That's what I've said for three days
an' I won't no more.

853
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:57,047
I know it's difficult, Miss Doolittle,
but try to understand.

854
00:59:57,139 --> 01:00:00,342
There's no use explaining.
As a military man you should know that.

855
01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:01,976
Drilling is what she needs.

856
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,467
Leave her alone or she'll turn to you
for sympathy.

857
01:00:04,562 --> 01:00:07,599
Very well, if you insist,
but have a little patience with her.

858
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:08,889
Of course.

859
01:00:09,526 --> 01:00:10,901
Say '"A.'"

860
01:00:11,069 --> 01:00:13,227
You ain't got no 'eart, you ain't.

861
01:00:20,747 --> 01:00:24,792
I promise you, you'll say your vowels
correctly before this day is out...

862
01:00:25,085 --> 01:00:29,414
...or there'll be no lunch,
no dinner, and no chocolates.

863

'"Just you wait, 'Enry 'lggins

Pickering, this is going to be ghastly.

908
01:04:40,467 --> 01:04:42,673
Control yourself, Higgins.
Give the girl a chance.

909
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,715
I suppose you can't expect her
to get it right the first time.

910
01:04:45,806 --> 01:04:48,047
Come here, Eliza, and watch closely.

911
01:04:52,145 --> 01:04:53,852
Now, you see that flame?

912
01:04:54,147 --> 01:04:57,646
Every time you pronounce the letter '"H'"
correctly the flame will waver...

913
01:04:57,734 --> 01:05:01,019
...and every time you drop your '"H'"
the flame will remain stationary.

914
01:05:01,112 --> 01:05:02,819
That's how to know
you've done it correctly.

915
01:05:02,905 --> 01:05:04,779
In time, your ear will hear the difference.

916
01:05:04,866 --> 01:05:08,530
You'll see it better in the mirror.
Now listen carefully.

924
01:05:32,185 --> 01:05:34,344
-Should I do it over?
-No, please.

925
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:37,685
Start from the very beginning.
Just do this.

Go on, go on.

927

Does the same thing hold true in lndia?

928
01:05:54,833 --> 01:05:57,917
Have they the peculiar habit
of not only dropping a letter...

929
01:05:58,002 --> 01:06:02,046
...but using it where it doesn't belong,
like '"hever'" instead of '"ever'"?

930
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,521
The girl, Higgins!

931
01:06:26,616 --> 01:06:27,814
Go on. Go on.

Kind of you. It's like '"cup of tea.'"

947
01:07:28,761 --> 01:07:31,596
Kind of you. Cup of tea. Say, '"cup of tea.'"

No. '"A cup of tea.'"

It's awfully good cake.
I wonder where Mrs. Pearce gets it.

are delicious. Did you try the pline cake?

Oh, no.

957

Can't you hear the difference?

958
01:08:01,002 --> 01:08:05,748
Look, put your tongue forward until
it squeezes on the top of your lower teeth.

959
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,458
And then say '"cup.'"

By Jove, Higgins, that was a glorious tea.

963
01:08:20,813 --> 01:08:24,064
You finish the last strawberry tart.
I couldn't eat another thing.

964
01:08:24,151 --> 01:08:26,059
-I couldn't touch it.
-Shame to waste it.

965
01:08:26,152 --> 01:08:30,944
Oh, it won't be wasted. I know somebody
who's immensely fond of strawberry tarts.

01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:18,744
-You'll consult your mother first, of course.
-Yes, of course.

1066
01:16:20,882 --> 01:16:24,132
No, I think we'd better surprise her.
Now let's go to bed.

1067
01:16:24,219 --> 01:16:27,089
First thing in the morning,
we'll go and buy her a dress.

1068
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:28,804
Now get on with your work, Eliza.

1069
01:16:28,890 --> 01:16:30,929
But, Mr. Higgins, it's early in the morning.

1070
01:16:31,017 --> 01:16:34,018
What better time to work
than early in the morning?

1071
01:16:34,354 --> 01:16:36,311
Where does one buy a lady's gown?

1072
01:16:36,397 --> 01:16:37,677
Whitely's, of course.

1073
01:16:37,773 --> 01:16:38,852
How do you know that?

1074
01:16:38,941 --> 01:16:40,352
Common knowledge.

1075
01:16:40,567 --> 01:16:42,359
Let's not buy her anything too flowery.

1076
01:16:42,444 --> 01:16:46,738
I despise those gowns with weeds here
and weeds there.

1077
01:16:47,157 --> 01:16:49,648
We'll buy something simple and modest...

1078
01:16:49,743 --> 01:16:52,031
...and elegant. That's what's called for.

1079
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,281
Perhaps with a bow.

1080
01:16:55,710 --> 01:16:57,417
Yes. That's just right.

1081
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:04,129
You've all been working too hard.
I think the strain is beginning to show.

1082
01:17:04,218 --> 01:17:06,506
Eliza, I don't care what Mr. Higgins says.

1083
01:17:06,595 --> 01:17:09,168
You must put down your books
and go to bed.

1084
01:17:09,264 --> 01:17:12,218
'"Bed! Bed! I couldn't go to bed

1085

It's after three now.

Don't you agree now?

1102
01:18:41,190 --> 01:18:44,025
She ought to be in bed!

01:24:48,559 --> 01:24:50,635
Henry! What a disagreeable surprise.

1152
01:24:50,728 --> 01:24:51,973
Hello, Mother.

1153
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:53,595
How nice you look.

1154
01:24:53,690 --> 01:24:57,058
What are you doing here? You promised
never to come to Ascot. Go home.

1155
01:24:57,151 --> 01:24:58,693
I can't. I'm here on business.

1156
01:24:58,778 --> 01:25:01,612
You must. I'm quite serious.
You'll offend all my friends.

1157
01:25:01,697 --> 01:25:04,153
The moment they meet you
I never see them again.

1158
01:25:04,242 --> 01:25:06,033
Besides, you aren't dressed for Ascot.

1159
01:25:06,118 --> 01:25:08,656
I changed my shirt.
Mother, I've got a job for you.

1160
01:25:08,746 --> 01:25:11,236
A phonetics job. I've picked up a girl.

1161
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:14,165
Not a love affair. She's a flower girl.

1162
01:25:14,253 --> 01:25:17,704
I'm taking her to the annual Embassy Ball
but I wanted to try her out first.

1163
01:25:17,798 --> 01:25:20,882
-I beg your pardon?
-Well, you know the Embassy Ball.

1164
01:25:21,426 --> 01:25:24,297
So I invited her to your box today,
do you understand?

1165
01:25:24,388 --> 01:25:25,847
Common flower girl?

1166
01:25:26,014 --> 01:25:27,971
I taught her how to speak properly.

1167
01:25:28,058 --> 01:25:30,346
She has strict instructions
as to her behavior.

1168
01:25:30,435 --> 01:25:33,851
She's to keep to two subjects:
the weather and everybody's health.

1169
01:25:33,939 --> 01:25:37,105
'"Fine day! '" and '"How do you do?'"
Not let herself go on.

1170
01:25:37,192 --> 01:25:39,231
Help her along. You'll be quite safe.

1171
01:25:39,319 --> 01:25:41,526
Safe? To talk about one's health
in the middle of a race?

1172
01:25:41,613 --> 01:25:43,654
She's got to talk about something.

1173
01:25:43,741 --> 01:25:44,939
Where is the girl now?

1174
01:25:45,034 --> 01:25:48,319
She's being pinned. Some of the clothes
we bought her didn't fit.

1175
01:25:48,412 --> 01:25:51,329
I told Pickering we should have
taken her with us.

1176
01:25:54,043 --> 01:25:57,209
-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill.
-Good afternoon, Mrs. Higgins.

1177
01:25:58,255 --> 01:25:59,914
You know my son, Henry.

1178
01:26:00,006 --> 01:26:01,251
How do you do?

1179
01:26:01,841 --> 01:26:04,216
-I've seen you somewhere before.
-I don't know.

1180
01:26:04,305 --> 01:26:06,795
It doesn't matter. You better sit down.

1181
01:26:10,351 --> 01:26:12,261
Where the devil can they be?

1182
01:26:47,221 --> 01:26:49,427
Colonel Pickering,
you're just in time for tea.

1183
01:26:49,514 --> 01:26:52,802
Thank you, Mrs. Higgins.
May I introduce Miss Eliza Doolittle?

1184
01:26:52,895 --> 01:26:54,223
My dear Miss Doolittle.

1185
01:26:54,313 --> 01:26:57,018
How kind of you to let me come.

1186
01:26:57,107 --> 01:26:58,601
Delighted, my dear.

1187
01:26:59,568 --> 01:27:01,560
-Lady Boxington.
-How do you do?

1188
01:27:03,656 --> 01:27:05,529
-Lord Boxington.
-How do you do?

1189
01:27:05,616 --> 01:27:06,529
How do you do?

1190
01:27:06,616 --> 01:27:09,534
-Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, Miss Doolittle.
-How do you do?

1191
01:27:09,619 --> 01:27:11,113
How do you do?

1192
01:27:11,371 --> 01:27:13,245
And Freddy Eynsford-Hill.

1193
01:27:14,416 --> 01:27:15,958
How do you do?

1194
01:27:18,294 --> 01:27:19,872
How do you do?

1195
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:21,911
Miss Doolittle.

1196
01:27:22,174 --> 01:27:25,340
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.

1197
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,265
The first race was very exciting,
Miss Doolittle.

1198
01:27:37,354 --> 01:27:39,596
I'm so sorry that you missed it.

1199
01:27:39,815 --> 01:27:41,641
Will it rain, do you think?

1200
01:27:41,945 --> 01:27:46,024
'"The rain in Spain stays mainly
in the plain.'"

1201
01:27:51,161 --> 01:27:55,658
'"But in Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire,
hurricanes hardly ever happen.'"

1202
01:27:57,042 --> 01:27:58,501
How awfully funny.

1203
01:27:58,668 --> 01:28:02,120
What is wrong with that, young man?
I bet I got it right.

1204
01:28:02,423 --> 01:28:03,502
Smashing.

1205
01:28:03,799 --> 01:28:06,254
Has it suddenly turned chilly?

1206
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:10,128
I do hope we won't have
any unseasonable cold spells.

1207
01:28:10,388 --> 01:28:12,381
They bring on so much influenza.

1208
01:28:12,474 --> 01:28:15,225
And the whole of our family
is susceptible to it.

1209
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:19,639
My aunt died of influenza, so they said.

1210
01:28:20,189 --> 01:28:23,974
But it's my belief they done
the old woman in.

1211
01:28:25,194 --> 01:28:26,475
Done her in?

1212
01:28:27,113 --> 01:28:28,820
Yes, Lord love you.

1213
01:28:29,073 --> 01:28:31,314
Why should she die of influenza...

1214
01:28:31,575 --> 01:28:35,361
...when she'd come through diphtheria
right enough the year before.

1215
01:28:35,623 --> 01:28:37,829
Fairly blue with it she was.

1216
01:28:38,501 --> 01:28:40,374
They all thought she was dead.

1217
01:28:40,461 --> 01:28:44,589
But my father, he kept ladling gin
down her throat.

1218
01:28:49,553 --> 01:28:53,930
Then she come to so sudden
she bit the bowl off the spoon.

1219
01:28:55,225 --> 01:28:56,684
Dear me!

1220
01:28:57,853 --> 01:29:01,186
Now what call would a woman
with that strength in her...

1221
01:29:01,272 --> 01:29:03,182
...have to die of influenza?

1222
01:29:03,901 --> 01:29:08,194
And what become of her new straw hat
that should have come to me?

1223
01:29:10,781 --> 01:29:13,107
Somebody pinched it.

1224
01:29:14,369 --> 01:29:16,160
And what I say is:

1225
01:29:16,371 --> 01:29:19,324
Them 'as pinched it, done her in.

1226
01:29:20,583 --> 01:29:23,123
Done her in? '"Done her in,'" did you say?

1227
01:29:23,838 --> 01:29:25,498
Whatever does it mean?

1228
01:29:25,632 --> 01:29:30,210
That's the new small talk.
'"To do somebody in'" means to kill them.

1229
01:29:30,886 --> 01:29:33,971
But you surely don't believe
your aunt was killed?

1230
01:29:34,557 --> 01:29:35,837
Do I not?

1231
01:29:35,975 --> 01:29:40,969
Them she lived with would have killed her
for a hatpin, let alone a hat.

1232
01:29:41,396 --> 01:29:43,805
But it can't have been right
for your father...

1233
01:29:43,899 --> 01:29:46,734
...to pour spirits down her throat like that.

1234
01:29:47,111 --> 01:29:48,770
It might have killed her.

1235
01:29:48,862 --> 01:29:52,647
Not her. Gin was mother's milk to her.

1236
01:29:53,033 --> 01:29:58,158
Besides, he poured so much down
his own throat he knew the good of it.

1237
01:29:58,913 --> 01:30:00,657
Do you mean that he drank?

1238
01:30:00,748 --> 01:30:03,584
Drank? My word. Something chronic.

1239
01:30:07,422 --> 01:30:10,506
Here, what are you sniggering at?

1240
01:30:11,175 --> 01:30:14,297
The new small talk.
You do it so awfully well.

1241
01:30:14,514 --> 01:30:18,179
Well, if I was doing it proper,
what was you sniggering at?

1242
01:30:19,143 --> 01:30:21,433
Have I said anything I oughtn't?

1243
01:30:23,356 --> 01:30:24,934
Not at all, my dear.

1244
01:30:25,149 --> 01:30:27,106
Well, that's a mercy anyhow.

1245
01:30:30,112 --> 01:30:33,648
I don't know if there's time
before the next race to place a bet...

1246
01:30:33,742 --> 01:30:35,569
...but come, my dear.

1247
01:30:35,952 --> 01:30:39,617
I have a bet on number seven.
I should be so happy if you would take it.

1248
01:30:39,706 --> 01:30:41,829
You'll enjoy the race ever so much more.

1249
01:30:41,917 --> 01:30:43,541
That's very kind of you.

1250
01:30:43,627 --> 01:30:44,741
His name is Dover.

1251
01:30:44,836 --> 01:30:46,295
Come along.

1252
01:30:49,757 --> 01:30:51,667
'"There they are again

1253
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,384
'"Lining up to run

1254
01:30:53,845 --> 01:30:55,553
'"Now they're holding steady

1255
01:30:55,638 --> 01:30:57,927
'"They are ready for it. Look!

1256
01:30:58,974 --> 01:31:01,216
'"lt has begun'"

1257
01:31:07,151 --> 01:31:08,942
Come on. Come on, Dover.

1258
01:31:09,903 --> 01:31:10,899
Come on.

1259
01:31:11,196 --> 01:31:12,822
Come on, Dover!

1260
01:31:12,949 --> 01:31:13,980
Come on!

1261
01:31:18,328 --> 01:31:22,492
Come on, Dover!
Move your bloomin' arse!

1262
01:31:29,005 --> 01:31:30,380
Oh, my dear.

1263
01:31:45,355 --> 01:31:49,222
You're not serious, Henry. You don't
expect to take her to the Embassy Ball.

1264
01:31:49,317 --> 01:31:50,859
Don't you think she's ready for it?

1265
01:31:50,943 --> 01:31:53,318
Dear Henry, she's ready for a canal barge.

1266
01:31:53,406 --> 01:31:55,648
Her language may need
a little refining, but--

1267
01:31:55,742 --> 01:31:59,359
Really, Henry, if you cannot see
how impossible this whole project is...

1268
01:31:59,453 --> 01:32:01,113
...then you must be potty about her.

1269
01:32:01,205 --> 01:32:03,282
I advise you to give up
and not put yourself...

1270
01:32:03,374 --> 01:32:04,952
...or this poor girl through any more.

1271
01:32:05,042 --> 01:32:07,580
It's the most fascinating venture
I've ever undertaken.

1272
01:32:07,670 --> 01:32:11,121
Pickering and I are at it from morning
till night. It fills our whole lives.

1273
01:32:11,214 --> 01:32:15,082
Teaching Eliza, talking to Eliza,
listening to Eliza, dressing Eliza.

1274
01:32:16,262 --> 01:32:19,796
You're a pretty pair of babies
playing with your live doll.

1275
01:32:19,890 --> 01:32:21,170
Here's the car.

1276
01:33:42,391 --> 01:33:43,422
Good evening, sir.

1277
01:33:43,517 --> 01:33:46,186
-Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
-Immediately, sir.

1278
01:33:46,269 --> 01:33:48,345
Good evening, Professor Higgins.

1279
01:34:05,955 --> 01:34:10,166
'"When she mentioned
how her aunt bit off the spoon

1280
01:34:10,917 --> 01:34:14,203
'"She completely done me in

1281
01:34:14,713 --> 01:34:18,082
'"And my heart went on
a journey to the moon

1282
01:34:18,675 --> 01:34:23,304
'"When she told about her father
and the gin

1283
01:34:23,974 --> 01:34:27,971
'"And I never saw a more enchanting farce

1284
01:34:28,687 --> 01:34:33,645
'"Than the moment when she shouted
'Move your bloomin'--''"

1285
01:34:34,359 --> 01:34:36,399
-Yes, sir?
-Is Miss Doolittle in?

1286
01:34:36,486 --> 01:34:38,313
Whom shall I say is calling?

1287
01:34:38,404 --> 01:34:41,691
Freddy Eynsford-Hill.
If she doesn't remember who I am...

1288
01:34:41,825 --> 01:34:44,742
...tell her I'm the chap
who was '"sniggering'" at her.

1289
01:34:44,828 --> 01:34:45,823
Yes, sir.

1290
01:34:45,912 --> 01:34:47,821
And will you give her these?

1291
01:34:48,289 --> 01:34:49,487
Wouldn't you like to come in?

1292
01:34:49,582 --> 01:34:51,705
They're having dinner,
but you may wait in the hall.

1293
01:34:51,793 --> 01:34:55,327
No, thank you. I want to drink in
the street where she lives.

1294
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:08,637
'"l have often walked
down this street before

1295
01:35:09,476 --> 01:35:14,354
'"But the pavement always stayed
beneath my feet before

1296
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:20,066
'"All at once am I several stories high

1297
01:35:20,739 --> 01:35:25,366
'"Knowing I'm on the street where you live

1298
01:35:26,661 --> 01:35:31,621
'"Are there lilac trees in the heart of town?

1299
01:35:32,335 --> 01:35:37,292
'"Can you hear a lark
in any other part of town?

1300
01:35:38,215 --> 01:35:43,043
'"Does enchantment pour
out of every door?

1301
01:35:43,846 --> 01:35:48,507
'"No, it's just on the street where you live

1302
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:54,556
'"And, oh, the towering feeling

1303
01:35:55,399 --> 01:35:59,894
'"Just to know somehow you are near

1304
01:36:01,657 --> 01:36:06,153
'"The overpowering feeling

1305
01:36:06,703 --> 01:36:11,365
'"That any second you may suddenly appear

1306

'"People stop and stare,

1307
01:36:18,715 --> 01:36:23,377

that I would rather be

1308
01:36:24,679 --> 01:36:27,680
'"Let the time go by

1309
01:36:27,807 --> 01:36:31,805
'"l won't care if I

1310
01:36:32,562 --> 01:36:37,223
'"Can be here on the street where you live'"

1311
01:36:44,573 --> 01:36:46,482
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

1312
01:36:46,617 --> 01:36:49,736
Miss Doolittle says she doesn't want
to see anyone ever again.

1313
01:36:49,828 --> 01:36:51,538
But why? She was unbelievable.

1314
01:36:51,624 --> 01:36:54,790
So I've been told, sir.
Is there any further message?

1315
01:36:55,961 --> 01:36:57,206
Tell her that I'll wait.

1316
01:36:57,296 --> 01:36:59,703
But it might be days, sir, even weeks.

1317
01:36:59,798 --> 01:37:02,336
But don't you see? I'll be happier here.

1318
01:37:11,268 --> 01:37:15,929
'"People stop and stare,
they don't bother me

1319
01:37:17,273 --> 01:37:21,935
'"For there's nowhere else on earth
that I would rather be

1320
01:37:23,113 --> 01:37:25,983

01:37:31,955 --> 01:37:36,616
'"Can be here on the street where you live'"

1323
01:37:46,804 --> 01:37:49,425
It really is, Higgins.
It's inhuman to continue.

1324
01:37:49,514 --> 01:37:52,551
Do you realize what you've got to teach
this girl in six weeks?

1325
01:37:52,643 --> 01:37:55,597
You've got to teach her to walk, talk,
address a duke, a lord...

1326
01:37:55,687 --> 01:37:58,392
...a bishop, an ambassador.
It's absolutely impossible.

1327
01:37:58,481 --> 01:38:02,017
Higgins, I'm trying to tell you
that I want to call off the bet.

1328
01:38:02,111 --> 01:38:04,352
I know you're a stubborn man, but so am l.

1329
01:38:04,446 --> 01:38:06,355
This experiment is over.

1330
01:38:06,448 --> 01:38:10,777
And nothing short of an order
from the king could force me to recant.

1331
01:38:12,787 --> 01:38:15,159
You understand, Higgins? It's over.

1332
01:38:16,916 --> 01:38:19,703
Higgins, if there's any mishap
at the Embassy tonight...

1333
01:38:19,794 --> 01:38:22,416
...if Miss Doolittle suffers
any embarrassment...

1334
01:38:22,505 --> 01:38:23,750
...it'll be on your head alone.

1335
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,085
Eliza can do anything.

1336
01:38:25,174 --> 01:38:26,965
Suppose she's discovered?
Remember Ascot.

1337
01:38:27,051 --> 01:38:28,924
Suppose she makes
another ghastly mistake?

1338
01:38:29,011 --> 01:38:31,683
There'll be no horses at the ball, Pickering.

1339
01:38:33,726 --> 01:38:36,015
Think of how agonizing it would be.

1340
01:38:36,103 --> 01:38:38,772
If anything happened tonight,
I don't know what I'd do.

1341
01:38:38,856 --> 01:38:40,433
You could always rejoin your regiment.

1342
01:38:40,524 --> 01:38:42,351
This is no time for flippancy, Higgins.

1343
01:38:42,443 --> 01:38:44,482
The way you've driven her
the last six weeks...

1344
01:38:44,570 --> 01:38:46,646
...has exceeded all bounds
of common decency.

1345
01:38:46,738 --> 01:38:49,739
For God's sake, stop pacing.
Can't you settle somewhere?

1346
01:38:49,824 --> 01:38:51,782
Have some port. It'll quieten your nerves.

1347
01:38:51,869 --> 01:38:53,197
I'm not nervous.

1348
01:38:54,830 --> 01:38:56,739
-Where is it?
-On the piano.

1349
01:38:58,291 --> 01:38:59,619
The car's here, sir.

1350
01:38:59,709 --> 01:39:01,370
Good. Tell Miss Doolittle.

1351
01:39:01,462 --> 01:39:05,079
Tell Miss Doolittle indeed.
I'll bet you that damned gown doesn't fit.

1352
01:39:05,173 --> 01:39:07,249
I warned you about these French designers.

1353
01:39:07,342 --> 01:39:10,676
We should've gone to an English shop.
They would've been on our side.

1354
01:39:10,762 --> 01:39:13,087
-Have a glass of port?
-No, thank you.

1355
01:39:19,436 --> 01:39:23,650
Are you so sure this girl will retain
everything you've hammered into her?

1356
01:39:24,235 --> 01:39:25,895
Well, we shall see.

1357
01:39:26,237 --> 01:39:27,779
Suppose she doesn't?

1358
01:39:29,031 --> 01:39:30,574
I lose my bet.

1359
01:39:30,742 --> 01:39:34,406
There's one thing I can't stand about you,
your confounded complacency.

1360
01:39:34,495 --> 01:39:36,534
At a moment like this,
with so much at stake...

1361
01:39:36,622 --> 01:39:40,121
...it's utterly indecent
that you don't need a glass of port.

1362
01:39:41,794 --> 01:39:45,542
And what about the girl? You act
as though she doesn't matter at all.

1363
01:39:45,631 --> 01:39:48,252
Rubbish, Pickering. Of course she matters.

1364
01:39:48,633 --> 01:39:51,042
What do you think I've been doing
all these months?

1365
01:39:51,137 --> 01:39:54,635
What could possibly matter more
than to take a human being...

1366
01:39:54,723 --> 01:39:58,934
...and change her into a different human
being by creating a new speech for her?

1367
01:39:59,018 --> 01:40:02,767
It's filling up the deepest gap
that separates class from class...

1368
01:40:02,939 --> 01:40:04,517
...and soul from soul.

1369
01:40:04,941 --> 01:40:07,610
Oh, she matters immensely.

1370
01:40:29,718 --> 01:40:32,209
Miss Doolittle, you look beautiful.

1371
01:40:32,888 --> 01:40:34,465
Thank you, Colonel Pickering.

1372
01:40:34,556 --> 01:40:36,465
Don't you think so, Higgins?

1373
01:40:39,185 --> 01:40:41,855
Not bad. Not bad at all.

1374
01:43:42,536 --> 01:43:44,991
Maestro! Maestro!

1375
01:43:47,249 --> 01:43:48,411
Don't you remember me?

1376
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:50,125
No. Who the devil are you?

1377
01:43:50,211 --> 01:43:53,661
I'm your pupil. Your first, your greatest,
your best pupil.

1378
01:43:53,797 --> 01:43:56,288
I'm Zoltan Karpathy, that marvelous boy.

1379
01:43:57,467 --> 01:43:59,424
I made your name famous
throughout Europe.

1380
01:43:59,510 --> 01:44:01,420
You teach me phonetics.
You can't forget me.

1381
01:44:01,513 --> 01:44:03,256
Why don't you have your hair cut?

1382
01:44:03,348 --> 01:44:06,882
I don't have your imposing appearance,
your figure, your brow.

1383
01:44:07,018 --> 01:44:09,057
If I had my hair cut,
nobody would notice me.

1384
01:44:09,145 --> 01:44:10,972
Where did you get these old coins?

1385
01:44:11,064 --> 01:44:13,056
These are decorations for languages.

1386
01:44:13,149 --> 01:44:14,892
The Queen of Transylvania is here.

1387
01:44:14,984 --> 01:44:18,103
I'm indispensable to her
at these official international parties.

1388
01:44:18,195 --> 01:44:21,115
I speak 32 languages.
I know everyone in Europe.

1389
01:44:21,201 --> 01:44:23,276
No imposter can escape my detection.

1390
01:44:23,369 --> 01:44:25,362
Professor Karpathy.

1391
01:44:27,539 --> 01:44:29,081
The Greek ambassador.

1392
01:44:29,875 --> 01:44:30,955
Greek, my foot!

1393
01:44:31,043 --> 01:44:33,830
He pretends not to know English,
but he can't deceive me.

1394
01:44:33,921 --> 01:44:36,328
He's the son of a Yorkshire watchmaker.

1395
01:44:37,049 --> 01:44:40,465
He speaks English so villainously
that he cannot utter a word...

1396
01:44:40,553 --> 01:44:42,794
...without betraying his origin.

1397
01:44:42,888 --> 01:44:46,636
I help him pretend, but make him pay
through the nose. I make them all pay.

1398
01:44:46,725 --> 01:44:50,011
Excuse me, sir, you are wanted upstairs.
Her Excellency asked for you.

1399
01:45:09,747 --> 01:45:11,742
Viscount and Viscountess Saxon.

1400
01:45:15,130 --> 01:45:18,001
Baron and Baroness of Yorkshire.

1401
01:45:19,718 --> 01:45:22,553
Sir Guy and Lady Scot-Auckland.

1402
01:45:42,407 --> 01:45:44,565
The Count and Countess Demereau.

1403
01:45:45,284 --> 01:45:47,775
The Viscount and Viscountess Hillyard.

1404
01:45:47,953 --> 01:45:50,825
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Lanser.

1405
01:45:51,457 --> 01:45:54,078
Lord and Lady Clanders.

1406
01:45:54,752 --> 01:45:57,622
Miss Eliza Doolittle, Colonel Pickering.

1407
01:45:57,963 --> 01:46:01,548
Miss Eliza Doolittle. Colonel Pickering.

1408
01:46:01,969 --> 01:46:03,962
Professor Higgins.

1409
01:46:04,472 --> 01:46:06,547
-Your Excellency.
-Miss Doolittle.

1410
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:07,920
How do you do?

1411
01:46:08,016 --> 01:46:10,306
-Good evening, Colonel.
-Good evening.

1412
01:46:11,729 --> 01:46:15,062
What an enchanting young lady
you have with you this evening.

1413
01:46:15,149 --> 01:46:16,559
Well, who is she?

1414
01:46:16,942 --> 01:46:20,643
Oh, a cousin of mine. And Higgins.
Excuse me.

1415
01:46:20,988 --> 01:46:22,316
Professor Higgins.

1416
01:46:22,406 --> 01:46:26,485
Such a faraway look,
as if she's always lived in a garden.

1417
01:46:26,826 --> 01:46:28,984
So she has. A sort of garden.

1418
01:46:57,858 --> 01:47:01,310
Henry must take Eliza home at once.
There's a language expert here.

1419
01:47:01,404 --> 01:47:04,570
-Sort of, you know, '"imposterologist.'"
-I beg you pardon?

1420
01:47:05,324 --> 01:47:07,862
The young lady with Colonel Pickering....

1421
01:47:07,993 --> 01:47:09,570
Find out who she is.

1422
01:47:09,829 --> 01:47:11,074
With pleasure.

1423
01:47:11,539 --> 01:47:14,029
The whole situation is highly explosive.

1424
01:47:19,838 --> 01:47:22,412
Tell me, Zoltan,
some more about the Greek ambassador.

1425
01:47:22,507 --> 01:47:26,090
Gladly, but first I would love you
to present me to this glorious creature.

1426
01:47:26,177 --> 01:47:28,383
Does he really come from Yorkshire?

1427
01:47:37,230 --> 01:47:40,067
Her Majesty, the Queen of Transylvania...

1428
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:43,526
...and His Royal Highness Prince Gregor.

1429
01:48:29,618 --> 01:48:32,109
Charming. Quite charming.

1430
01:48:33,455 --> 01:48:35,246
Miss Doolittle, Madam.

1431
01:50:11,346 --> 01:50:14,382
Miss Doolittle, my son would like
to dance with you.

1432
01:53:21,035 --> 01:53:22,862
Absolutely fantastic.

1433
01:53:26,331 --> 01:53:27,790
A lot of tomfoolery.

1434
01:53:27,874 --> 01:53:29,917
It was an immense achievement.

1435
01:53:30,004 --> 01:53:31,463
Well, Mr. Higgins?

1436
01:53:31,923 --> 01:53:35,042
A triumph, Mrs. Pearce. A total triumph.

1437
01:53:35,342 --> 01:53:38,793
Higgins, you were superb,
absolutely superb.

1438
01:53:39,013 --> 01:53:42,962
Tell us the truth now, weren't you
a little bit nervous once or twice?

1439
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:44,843
Not during the whole evening?

1440
01:53:44,935 --> 01:53:46,595
Not when I saw we were going to win.

1441
01:53:46,686 --> 01:53:48,679
I felt like a bear in a cage hanging about.

1442
01:53:48,771 --> 01:53:50,432
It was an immense achievement.

1443
01:53:50,524 --> 01:53:53,608
If I hadn't backed myself to do it,
I'd have given up two months ago.

1444
01:53:53,693 --> 01:53:55,022
Absolutely fantastic.

1445
01:53:55,111 --> 01:53:56,653
Yes, a lot of tomfoolery.

1446
01:53:56,738 --> 01:53:58,695
Higgins, I salute you.

1447
01:53:58,781 --> 01:54:01,533
The silly people don't know
their own silly business.

1448
01:54:01,618 --> 01:54:04,618
'"Tonight, old man, you did it
You did it, you did it

Thank goodness for Zoltan Karpathy.

If it hadn't been for him
I would've died of boredom.

1476
01:55:36,964 --> 01:55:39,207
Karpathy? That dreadful Hungarian?
Was he there?

1477
01:55:39,301 --> 01:55:42,385
Yes, he was there all right

Take your slippers and may you never
have a day's luck with them.

1525
02:00:10,867 --> 02:00:12,860
What on earth? What's the matter?

1526
02:00:12,952 --> 02:00:14,612
Is anything wrong?

1527
02:00:14,746 --> 02:00:17,699
No, nothing's wrong with you.
I won your bet for you, haven't l?

1528
02:00:17,790 --> 02:00:20,661
That's enough for you!
I don't matter, I suppose?

1529
02:00:21,252 --> 02:00:24,870
You won my bet?
You presumptuous insect! I won it!

1530
02:00:24,964 --> 02:00:26,623
Why did you throw the slippers at me?

1531
02:00:26,715 --> 02:00:30,167
Because I wanted to smash your face.
I could kill you, you selfish brute!

1532
02:00:30,261 --> 02:00:32,419
Why didn't you leave me
where you picked me up?

1533
02:00:32,513 --> 02:00:36,296
You thank God it's all over. Now you can
throw me back again! Do you?

1534
02:00:36,391 --> 02:00:38,965
Oh, so the creature's nervous after all?

1535
02:00:42,231 --> 02:00:44,804
Claws in, you cat!
How dare you show your temper to me?

1536
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:46,477
Sit down and be quiet!

1537
02:00:46,568 --> 02:00:49,190
What's to become of me?

1538
02:00:52,365 --> 02:00:54,274
How do I know what's to become of you?

1539
02:00:54,367 --> 02:00:55,565
What does it matter?

1540
02:00:55,660 --> 02:00:58,332
You don't care. I know you don't care.

1541
02:00:58,415 --> 02:01:00,906
You wouldn't care if I was dead.
I'm nothing to you.

1542
02:01:01,001 --> 02:01:02,874
Not as much as them slippers.

1543
02:01:02,961 --> 02:01:04,040
Those slippers!

1544
02:01:04,129 --> 02:01:07,793
Those slippers! I didn't think it meant
any difference now.

1545
02:01:11,386 --> 02:01:14,137
Why have you suddenly begun
going on like this?

1546
02:01:14,472 --> 02:01:17,141
May I ask if you complain
of your treatment here?

1547
02:01:17,224 --> 02:01:18,054
No.

1548
02:01:18,183 --> 02:01:21,304
Has anybody behaved badly?
Colonel Pickering, Mrs. Pearce?

1549
02:01:21,396 --> 02:01:22,427
No.

1550
02:01:22,730 --> 02:01:25,814
Well you don't pretend
that I have treated you badly?

1551
02:01:26,608 --> 02:01:27,639
No.

1552
02:01:27,734 --> 02:01:29,644
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

1553
02:01:30,655 --> 02:01:33,525
Perhaps you're tired
after the strain of the day.

1554
02:01:34,199 --> 02:01:36,571
Would you have a chocolate?

1555
02:01:36,910 --> 02:01:39,402
No, thank you.

1556
02:01:41,582 --> 02:01:45,579
Well, it's only natural that you should
be anxious, but it's all over now.

1557
02:01:45,668 --> 02:01:47,542
Nothing more to worry about.

1558
02:01:47,629 --> 02:01:50,502
No, nothing more for you to worry about.

1559
02:01:51,843 --> 02:01:54,548
Oh, God, I wish I was dead.

1560
02:01:55,180 --> 02:01:57,753
Why? ln heaven's name, why?

1561
02:01:58,600 --> 02:02:02,348
Now listen to me, Eliza.
All this irritation is purely subjective.

1562
02:02:02,729 --> 02:02:04,970
I don't understand. I'm too ignorant.

1563
02:02:05,064 --> 02:02:08,564
It's just imagination. Nothing's wrong.
Nobody's hurting you.

1564
02:02:08,652 --> 02:02:09,850
Go to bed and sleep it off.

1565
02:02:09,944 --> 02:02:14,405
Have a little cry and say your prayers.
You'll feel very much more comfortable.

1566
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:16,567
I heard your prayers.

1567
02:02:16,742 --> 02:02:18,486
'"Thank God it's all over.'"

1568
02:02:18,620 --> 02:02:20,327
Don't you thank God it's all over?

1569
02:02:20,413 --> 02:02:22,820
Now you're free,
and you can do what you like.

1570
02:02:22,915 --> 02:02:26,034
Oh, what am I fit for?
What have you left me fit for?

1571
02:02:26,752 --> 02:02:29,504
Where am I to go? What am I to do?

1572
02:02:30,131 --> 02:02:32,206
And what's to become of me?

1573
02:02:33,300 --> 02:02:36,135
That's what's worrying you, is it?

1574
02:02:37,762 --> 02:02:39,722
I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.

1575
02:02:39,809 --> 02:02:44,221
I'm sure you won't have any difficulty
in settling yourself somewhere or other.

1576
02:02:46,982 --> 02:02:49,604
I didn't quite realize you were going away.

1577
02:02:50,652 --> 02:02:52,609
You might marry, you know.

1578
02:02:52,988 --> 02:02:56,901
You see, Eliza, all men are not confirmed
old bachelors like me and the Colonel.

1579
02:02:56,991 --> 02:02:59,993
Most men are the marrying sort,
poor devils.

1580
02:03:00,745 --> 02:03:01,741
You're not bad-looking.

1581
02:03:01,830 --> 02:03:04,320
You're really quite a pleasure
to look at sometimes.

1582
02:03:04,415 --> 02:03:05,957
Not now, when you've been crying.

1583
02:03:06,042 --> 02:03:07,833
You look like the very devil, but...

1584
02:03:07,918 --> 02:03:12,379
...when you're all right and quite yourself
you're what I would call attractive.

1585
02:03:14,300 --> 02:03:16,625
Go to bed, have a good rest,
get up in the morning...

1586
02:03:16,719 --> 02:03:20,503
...and have a look at yourself in the glass.
You won't feel so bad.

1587
02:03:24,977 --> 02:03:28,811
I daresay, my mother might find some
fellow or other who would do very well.

1588
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:31,022
We were above that at Covent Garden.

1589
02:03:31,110 --> 02:03:32,569
What do you mean?

1590
02:03:32,778 --> 02:03:35,316
I sold flowers, I didn't sell myself.

1591
02:03:36,073 --> 02:03:39,193
Now you've made a lady of me,
I'm not fit to sell anything else.

1592
02:03:39,285 --> 02:03:41,954
Oh, tosh, Eliza.
Don't insult human relations...

1593
02:03:42,037 --> 02:03:45,073
...by dragging all that cant
about buying and selling into it.

1594
02:03:45,165 --> 02:03:47,241
Don't marry the fellow if you don't want to.

1595
02:03:47,333 --> 02:03:48,959
What else am I to do?

1596
02:03:49,044 --> 02:03:50,871
Oh, there are lots of things.

1597
02:03:50,962 --> 02:03:53,370
What about the old idea of a florist shop?

1598
02:03:53,465 --> 02:03:56,501
I'm sure Pickering'd set you up in one.
He's got lots of money.

1599
02:03:56,592 --> 02:03:58,550
He'll pay for all those togs you're wearing.

1600
02:03:58,637 --> 02:04:02,716
And that with the hire of the jewelry'll
make a big hole in 200 pounds.

1601
02:04:02,932 --> 02:04:05,304
Come on now. You'll be all right.

1602
02:04:06,477 --> 02:04:09,644
Well, I must be off to bed.
I'm really devilish sleepy.

1603
02:04:10,982 --> 02:04:13,270
I was looking for something. What was it?

1604
02:04:13,359 --> 02:04:14,557
Your slippers.

1605
02:04:15,069 --> 02:04:17,820
Oh, yes, of course. You shied them at me.

1606
02:04:18,950 --> 02:04:21,238
Before you go, sir.

1607
02:04:24,997 --> 02:04:27,998
Do my clothes belong to me
or to Colonel Pickering?

1608
02:04:29,085 --> 02:04:31,291
What the devil use would they be
to Pickering?

1609
02:04:31,378 --> 02:04:33,371
Why bother about that
in the middle of the night?

1610
02:04:33,464 --> 02:04:34,922
What may I take away with me?

1611
02:04:35,007 --> 02:04:37,414
I don't want to be accused of stealing.

1612
02:04:38,094 --> 02:04:39,173
Stealing?

1613
02:04:40,262 --> 02:04:43,547
You shouldn't have said that.
That shows a want of feeling.

1614
02:04:43,640 --> 02:04:47,684
I'm sorry. I'm a common, ignorant girl
and in my station I have to be careful.

1615
02:04:47,769 --> 02:04:51,222
There can't be any feelings between
the likes of you and the likes of me.

1616
02:04:51,315 --> 02:04:54,814
Please, will you tell me
what belongs to me and what doesn't?

1617
02:04:55,277 --> 02:04:57,649
Take the whole damned houseful
if you want.

1618
02:04:57,738 --> 02:05:00,490
Except the jewelry. That's hired.
Will that satisfy you?

1619
02:05:00,574 --> 02:05:01,819
Stop, please.

1620
02:05:04,036 --> 02:05:07,072
Will you take these to your room
and keep them safe?

1621
02:05:07,917 --> 02:05:10,834
I don't want to run the risk
of them being missed.

1622
02:05:12,421 --> 02:05:15,920
Hand them over! lf these belonged
to me and not the jeweler, I'd...

1623
02:05:16,007 --> 02:05:18,581
...l'd ram them down
your ungrateful throat.

1624
02:05:18,886 --> 02:05:22,965
The ring isn't the jeweler's.
It's the one you bought me in Brighton.

1625
02:05:24,307 --> 02:05:25,849
I don't want it now.

1626
02:05:29,104 --> 02:05:30,764
Don't you hit me!

1627
02:05:31,273 --> 02:05:34,439
Hit you? You infamous creature!
How dare you suggest such a thing!

1628
02:05:34,525 --> 02:05:37,194
It's you who've hit me.
You've wounded me to the heart.

1629
02:05:37,278 --> 02:05:40,861
I'm glad. I've got a little
of my own back anyhow.

1630
02:05:42,033 --> 02:05:45,615
You've caused me to lose my temper.
That's hardly happened to me before.

1631
02:05:45,703 --> 02:05:48,491
I don't wish to discuss it further tonight.
I'm going to bed.

1632
02:05:48,581 --> 02:05:51,154
Leave your own note for Mrs. Pearce
about the coffee...

1633
02:05:51,250 --> 02:05:52,828
...for it won't be done by me!

1634
02:05:52,918 --> 02:05:56,501
Damn Mrs. Pearce,
damn the coffee and damn you!

1635
02:05:57,759 --> 02:06:01,008
Damn my own folly for having lavished
my hard-earned knowledge...

1636
02:06:01,095 --> 02:06:05,258
...and the treasure of my regard
and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe!

Nothing. I spend most of my nights here.
It's the only place where I'm happy.

02:09:15,955 --> 02:09:17,582
Don't laugh at me, Miss Doolittle.

1659

Don't you call me '"Miss Doolittle,'"
do you hear? Eliza's good enough for me.

1660
02:09:23,923 --> 02:09:27,507
Freddy, you don't think
I'm a heartless guttersnipe, do you?

1661
02:09:27,594 --> 02:09:30,678
Darling, how could you imagine
such a thing? You know how I feel.

1662
02:09:30,764 --> 02:09:34,215

We must visit it more often.

Father?

1734
02:15:43,973 --> 02:15:47,307
Oh, no. You see, Harry, he has no mercy.

Sent her down to spy on me in me misery,
he did. Me own flesh and blood.

1736
02:15:54,650 --> 02:15:57,737
Well, I'm miserable, all right.
You can tell him that straight.

1737
02:15:57,822 --> 02:16:00,491
What are you talking about?
What are you dressed up for?

1738
02:16:00,574 --> 02:16:01,985
As if you didn't know.

1739
02:16:02,076 --> 02:16:06,073
Go on back to that Wimpole Street devil.
Tell him what he's done to me.

1740
02:16:06,288 --> 02:16:07,913
What's he done to you?

1741
02:16:08,332 --> 02:16:09,577
Ruined me, that's all.

1742
02:16:09,667 --> 02:16:13,498
Tied me up and delivered me
into the hands of middle-class morality.

1743
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:15,295
And don't you defend him.

1744
02:16:15,380 --> 02:16:19,923
Was it 'im or was it not 'im wrote to an old
American blighter named Wallingford...

1745

to found Moral Reform societies...

1746
02:16:24,681 --> 02:16:29,259
...to tell him the most original moralist
in England was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle...

1747
02:16:29,352 --> 02:16:30,894
...a common dustman?

1748
02:16:32,397 --> 02:16:34,353
Sounds like one of his jokes.

1749
02:16:34,523 --> 02:16:37,727
You may call it a joke.
It's put the lid on me. Proper.

1750
02:16:38,027 --> 02:16:42,274
The old bloke died and left me
4,000 pounds a year in his bloomin' will.

1751
02:16:43,699 --> 02:16:47,830
Who asked him to make a gentleman
outta me? I was 'appy. I was free.

1752
02:16:48,414 --> 02:16:52,625
I touched pretty nigh everyone for money
when I wanted it, same as I touched him.

1753
02:16:52,710 --> 02:16:56,328
Now I'm tied neck and 'eels
and everybody touches me.

1754
02:16:57,048 --> 02:16:59,918
A year ago I 'adn't a relation in the world...

1755
02:17:00,634 --> 02:17:02,710
...except one or two
who wouldn't speak to me.

1756
02:17:02,803 --> 02:17:06,421
Now I've 50. Not a decent week's wages
amongst the lot of them.

1757
02:17:07,058 --> 02:17:11,719
I have to live for others now,
not for meself. Middle-class morality.

1758
02:17:12,437 --> 02:17:15,770
Come on, Alfie, in a few hours
we have to be at the church.

1759
02:17:15,857 --> 02:17:18,064
-Church?
-Yeah, church.

1760
02:17:19,069 --> 02:17:20,978
The deepest cut of all.

1761
02:17:21,488 --> 02:17:24,690
Why do you think I'm dressed up
like a ruddy pallbearer?

1762
02:17:25,241 --> 02:17:27,151
Your stepmother wants to marry me.

1763
02:17:27,244 --> 02:17:30,078
Now I'm respectable,
she wants to be respectable.

1764
02:17:30,371 --> 02:17:33,740
If that's the way you feel,
why don't you give the money back?

1765
02:17:33,833 --> 02:17:35,908
That's the tragedy of it, Eliza.

1766
02:17:36,168 --> 02:17:38,045
It's easy to say chuck it...

1767
02:17:38,882 --> 02:17:40,708
...but I 'aven't the nerve.

1768
02:17:41,050 --> 02:17:43,671
We're all intimidated.
That's what we are, intimidated.

1769
02:17:43,761 --> 02:17:46,430
Bought up. Yeah. That's what I am.

1770
02:17:47,182 --> 02:17:49,851
That's what your precious professor's
brought me to.

1771
02:17:49,934 --> 02:17:51,926
Not my precious professor.

1772
02:17:52,645 --> 02:17:54,554
Oh, sent you back, 'as he?

1773
02:17:56,231 --> 02:18:01,143
First he shoves me in the middle-class,
then he chucks you out for me to support.

1774
02:18:01,779 --> 02:18:03,771
That's all part of his plan...

1775
02:18:04,406 --> 02:18:06,315
...but you double-cross him.

1776
02:18:06,909 --> 02:18:11,072
Don't you come back home to me.
Don't you take tuppence from me.

1777
02:18:11,663 --> 02:18:15,197
You stand on your own two feet.
You're a lady now, you can do it.

1778
02:18:15,291 --> 02:18:18,246
Yeah, that's right, Eliza.
You're a lady now.

1779
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:20,996
It's getting awfully cold in that taxi.

1780
02:18:21,089 --> 02:18:25,216
Here, Eliza, would you like to come
and see me turned off this morning?

You were there.

Did you bully her after I went to bed?

1873

She threw the slippers at me.

1874

I never gave her the slightest provocation.

1875
02:25:35,862 --> 02:25:38,353
The slippers came at my head
before I uttered a word.

1876
02:25:38,448 --> 02:25:42,315
She used the most disgraceful language.
I was shocked! I don't understand.

1877
02:25:42,410 --> 02:25:45,078
We always gave her every consideration.
She admitted it.

02:25:45,162 --> 02:25:46,028
I'm dashed!

1879
02:25:46,122 --> 02:25:49,656
Pickering, for God's sake,
stop being dashed and do something!

1880

Phone the police. What are they there for?

1881

You can't give Eliza's name to the police...

But why not? I want to find the girl.

1884
02:25:59,261 --> 02:26:01,966
She belongs to me.
I paid five pounds for her.

1885
02:26:02,222 --> 02:26:04,891
Quite right. Hello. Scotland Yard, please?

1886

1893
02:26:26,913 --> 02:26:29,784
I should say about 5 foot 7.

1894
02:26:31,042 --> 02:26:34,991
Her eyes? Let me think now. Her eyes....

1895
02:26:35,337 --> 02:26:37,081
-Brown.
-Brown.

1896
02:26:39,842 --> 02:26:44,550

No. This is her residence. 27A--

this morning, I understand.

1901
02:26:56,694 --> 02:26:59,778
No.... She's no relation, no.

1902
02:27:00,739 --> 02:27:03,656
Well, let's call her a good friend, shall we?

1903

I beg your pardon?

1904
02:27:05,703 --> 02:27:08,454
Listen to me, I don't like the tenor
of that question.

1905
02:27:08,539 --> 02:27:10,910
What the girl does here is our affair.

1906
02:27:12,208 --> 02:27:15,660
Your affair is to get her back
so she can continue doing it.

1975

'"Why is thinking

1976

'"And why is logic never even tried?

The mess that's inside?

1979
02:31:44,941 --> 02:31:47,517

'"Why can't a woman be like me?'"

1986
02:32:11,343 --> 02:32:14,427
You mean that after you'd done
this wonderful thing for them...

1987
02:32:14,513 --> 02:32:16,008
...without making a mistake...

1988
02:32:16,099 --> 02:32:18,091
...they just sat there
and never said a word?

1989
02:32:18,184 --> 02:32:21,967
Never petted you, or admired you,
or told you how splendid you'd been?

1990
02:32:22,062 --> 02:32:22,726
Not a word.

1991
02:32:22,813 --> 02:32:26,017
They just congratulated each other
on how marvelous they'd been.

1992
02:32:26,108 --> 02:32:28,599
The next moment, how glad they were
it was all over...

1993
02:32:28,694 --> 02:32:30,485
...and what a bore it had all been.

1994
02:32:30,570 --> 02:32:33,820
This is appalling. I should not
have thrown my slippers at him.

1995
02:32:33,907 --> 02:32:36,151
I should have thrown the fire irons.

1996
02:32:36,287 --> 02:32:37,449
Who's that?

1997
02:32:37,579 --> 02:32:40,284
Henry. I knew it wouldn't be too long.

1998
02:32:41,875 --> 02:32:43,250
Now, remember...

1999
02:32:44,002 --> 02:32:48,331
...you not only danced with a prince
last night, you behaved like a princess.

2000
02:32:55,222 --> 02:32:57,926
Mother, the most confounded thing....
Do you--

2001
02:33:01,477 --> 02:33:02,390
You!

2002
02:33:03,229 --> 02:33:06,349
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.
Are you quite well?

2003
02:33:07,817 --> 02:33:11,944
Of course you are. You are never ill.
Would you care for some tea?

2004
02:33:12,738 --> 02:33:15,609
Don't you dare try that game on me.
I taught it to you.

2005
02:33:15,700 --> 02:33:17,443
Get up, come home and stop being a fool.

2006
02:33:17,535 --> 02:33:19,077
You've caused me enough trouble.

2007
02:33:19,161 --> 02:33:23,158
Very nicely put indeed, Henry.
No woman could resist such an invitation.

2008
02:33:23,248 --> 02:33:24,825
How did this baggage get here?

2009
02:33:24,919 --> 02:33:27,873
Eliza came to see me this morning
and I was delighted to have her.

2010
02:33:27,963 --> 02:33:30,917
If you don't promise to behave yourself
I'll ask you to leave.

2011
02:33:31,008 --> 02:33:33,000
I'm to put on my Sunday manners
for this...

2012
02:33:33,093 --> 02:33:36,877
...thing that I created out of the squashed
cabbage leaves of Covent Garden?

2013
02:33:36,972 --> 02:33:38,715
That's precisely what I mean.

2014
02:33:38,807 --> 02:33:40,385
I'll see her damned first.

2015
02:33:40,475 --> 02:33:43,595
However did you learn good manners
with my son around?

2016
02:33:43,811 --> 02:33:48,141
It was very difficult. I should never have
known how ladies and gentlemen behave...

2017
02:33:48,233 --> 02:33:50,854
...if it hadn't been for Colonel Pickering.

2018
02:33:52,278 --> 02:33:54,520
He showed me that he felt
and thought about me...

2019
02:33:54,613 --> 02:33:57,983
...as if I were something better
than a common flower girl.

2020
02:34:00,620 --> 02:34:04,202
You see, Mrs. Higgins,
apart from the things one can pick up...

2021
02:34:04,373 --> 02:34:08,122
...the difference between a lady
and a flower girl isn't how she behaves...

2022
02:34:08,211 --> 02:34:10,002
...but how she is treated.

2023
02:34:12,799 --> 02:34:15,293
I'll always be a flower girl
to Professor Higgins...

2024
02:34:15,387 --> 02:34:19,005
...because he always treats me
as a flower girl and always will.

2025
02:34:19,725 --> 02:34:21,847
I'll always be a lady to Colonel Pickering...

2026
02:34:21,935 --> 02:34:25,221
...because he always treats me
as a lady and always will.

2027
02:34:30,109 --> 02:34:31,568
Henry, don't grind your teeth.

2028
02:34:31,652 --> 02:34:34,487
The bishop is here.
Shall I show him into the garden?

2029
02:34:34,572 --> 02:34:37,063
The bishop and the professor?
Good heavens, no!

2030
02:34:37,158 --> 02:34:38,985
I should be excommunicated.

2031
02:34:39,285 --> 02:34:41,194
I'll see him in the library.

2032
02:34:41,954 --> 02:34:44,623
Eliza, if my son starts breaking up things...

2033
02:34:44,833 --> 02:34:47,537
...l give you full permission
to have him evicted.

2034
02:34:47,627 --> 02:34:51,838
Henry, I suggest you stick to two subjects:
the weather and your health.

2035
02:35:19,659 --> 02:35:21,699
You've had a bit of your own back,
as you say.

2036
02:35:21,786 --> 02:35:25,203
Have you had enough and will you
be reasonable or do you want any more?

2037
02:35:25,290 --> 02:35:27,283
You want me back to pick up
your slippers...

2038
02:35:27,375 --> 02:35:30,411
...and put up with your tempers
and fetch and carry for you.

2039
02:35:30,503 --> 02:35:32,294
I didn't say I wanted you back at all.

2040
02:35:32,380 --> 02:35:33,755
Then what are we talking about?

2041
02:35:33,839 --> 02:35:35,465
Well, about you, not about me.

2042
02:35:35,550 --> 02:35:38,254
If you come back you'll be treated
as you always have.

2043
02:35:38,344 --> 02:35:40,586
I can't change my nature or my manners.

2044
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:43,514
My manners are exactly
the same as Colonel Pickering's.

2045
02:35:43,599 --> 02:35:47,383
That's not true. He treats a flower girl
as if she were a duchess.

2046
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:49,761
I treat a duchess
as if she was a flower girl.

2047
02:35:49,855 --> 02:35:52,013
I see. The same to everybody.

2048
02:35:52,482 --> 02:35:55,237
The great secret is not a question
of good manners...

2049
02:35:55,321 --> 02:35:58,772
...or bad manners
or any particular sort of manner...

2050
02:35:59,283 --> 02:36:02,651
...but having the same manner
for all human souls.

2051
02:36:04,537 --> 02:36:06,946
The question is not
whether I treat you rudely...

2052
02:36:07,041 --> 02:36:10,456
...but whether you've ever heard me
treat anyone else better.

2053
02:36:10,544 --> 02:36:12,501
I don't care how you treat me.

2054
02:36:12,587 --> 02:36:15,672
I don't mind your swearing at me.
I shouldn't mind a black eye.

2055
02:36:15,757 --> 02:36:18,841
I've had one before this.
But I won't be passed over!

2056
02:36:19,052 --> 02:36:20,926
Get out of my way,
for I won't stop for you.

2057
02:36:21,012 --> 02:36:23,135
You talk about me as though
I was a motorbus.

2058
02:36:23,222 --> 02:36:27,434
So you are a motorbus. All bounce and go
and no consideration for anybody.

2059
02:36:27,685 --> 02:36:30,437
But I can get along without you.
Don't you think I can't!

2060
02:36:30,521 --> 02:36:32,929
I know you can. I told you, you could.

2061
02:36:36,361 --> 02:36:38,934
You've never wondered, I suppose,
whether...

2062
02:36:39,030 --> 02:36:41,567
...whether I could get along without you?

2063
02:36:42,658 --> 02:36:45,697
Don't you try to get around me.
You'll have to.

2064
02:36:46,914 --> 02:36:49,535
So I can, without you or any soul on earth.

2065
02:36:52,669 --> 02:36:56,881
I shall miss you, Eliza. I've learned
something from your idiotic notions.

2066
02:36:57,550 --> 02:37:00,087
I confess that humbly and gratefully.

2067
02:37:03,054 --> 02:37:05,427
Well, you have my voice
on your gramophone.

2068
02:37:05,516 --> 02:37:10,011
When you feel lonely without me you can
turn it on. It has no feelings to hurt.

2069
02:37:11,521 --> 02:37:14,272
Well, I can't turn your soul on.

2070
02:37:16,943 --> 02:37:19,185
You are a devil!

2071
02:37:20,155 --> 02:37:22,645
You can twist the heart in a girl
just as easily...

2072
02:37:22,740 --> 02:37:25,196
...as some can twist her arms to hurt her.

2073
02:37:25,285 --> 02:37:27,112
What am I to come back for?

2074
02:37:27,453 --> 02:37:29,529
For the fun of it. That's why I took you on.

2075
02:37:29,622 --> 02:37:32,373
You may throw me out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want.

2076
02:37:32,458 --> 02:37:35,876
Yes. And you may walk out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want.

2077
02:37:35,964 --> 02:37:37,162
And live with my father?

2078
02:37:37,257 --> 02:37:39,794
Yes, or sell flowers.
Would you rather marry Pickering?

2079
02:37:39,884 --> 02:37:43,632
I wouldn't marry you if you asked me
and you're nearer my age then what he is.

2080
02:37:43,721 --> 02:37:46,924
-Than he is.
-I'll talk as I like, you're not my teacher.

2081
02:37:47,016 --> 02:37:49,851
That's not what I want
and don't you think it is.

2082
02:37:49,935 --> 02:37:52,177
I've always had chaps enough
wanting me that way.

2083
02:37:52,271 --> 02:37:55,356
Freddy Hill writes me twice
and three times a day. Sheets and sheets.

2084
02:37:55,441 --> 02:37:59,390
In short, you want me to be
as infatuated about you as he is, is that it?

2085
02:37:59,486 --> 02:38:03,483
No, I don't. That's not the sort of feeling
I want from you.

2086
02:38:04,575 --> 02:38:06,318
I want a little kindness.

2087
02:38:06,743 --> 02:38:10,444
I know I'm a common, ignorant girl,
and you're a book-learned gentleman...

2088
02:38:10,538 --> 02:38:12,780
...but I'm not dirt under your feet.

2089
02:38:13,041 --> 02:38:18,035
What I done...what I did was not
for the taxis and the dresses...

2090
02:38:18,463 --> 02:38:22,128
...but because we were pleasant together
and I come to...came...

2091
02:38:23,467 --> 02:38:24,964
...to care for you.

2092
02:38:25,263 --> 02:38:27,055
Not to want you to make love to me...

2093
02:38:27,140 --> 02:38:30,224
...and not forgetting the difference
between us, but...

2094
02:38:30,309 --> 02:38:31,969
...more friendly like.

2095
02:38:34,188 --> 02:38:36,430
Well, of course. That's how I feel.

2096
02:38:37,066 --> 02:38:40,649
And how Pickering feels.
Eliza, you're a fool!

2097
02:38:40,736 --> 02:38:42,111
That's not the proper answer.

2098
02:38:42,196 --> 02:38:44,153
It's the only answer
till you stop being an idiot.

2099
02:38:44,239 --> 02:38:46,398
To be a lady, you must stop
feeling neglected...

2100
02:38:46,492 --> 02:38:49,113
...if men don't spend half their time
sniveling over you...

2101
02:38:49,203 --> 02:38:51,242
...and the other half giving you black eyes.

2102
02:38:51,330 --> 02:38:53,737
You find me cold, unfeeling, selfish,
don't you?

2103
02:38:53,832 --> 02:38:55,909
Off with you to the sort of people you like.

2104
02:38:56,001 --> 02:38:57,910
Marry a sentimental hog
with lots of money...

2105
02:38:58,003 --> 02:39:00,754
...and thick lips to kiss you,
and thick boots to kick you.

2106
02:39:00,839 --> 02:39:04,006
If you can't appreciate what you have,
then get what you can appreciate.

2107
02:39:04,344 --> 02:39:07,179
I can't talk to you.
You always turn everything against me.

2108
02:39:07,263 --> 02:39:08,971
I'm always in the wrong.

2109
02:39:09,181 --> 02:39:11,423
Don't be too sure you have me
under your feet...

2110
02:39:11,517 --> 02:39:13,639
...to be trampled on and talked down.

2111
02:39:13,727 --> 02:39:17,264
I'll marry Freddy, I will,
as soon as I'm able to support him.

2112
02:39:18,734 --> 02:39:21,355
The poor devil who couldn't get a job
as an errand boy...

2113
02:39:21,445 --> 02:39:23,402
...even if he had the guts to try?

2114
02:39:23,489 --> 02:39:27,238
Don't you understand?
I have made you a consort for a king!

2115
02:39:27,410 --> 02:39:30,363
Freddy loves me.
That makes him king enough for me.

2116
02:39:30,454 --> 02:39:33,454
I don't want him to work.
He wasn't brought up to do it as I was.
