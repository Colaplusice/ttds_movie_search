1
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,607
We have seen a star in the east.

2
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,030
It told us
the Son of God is born.

3
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:05,899
Nativity Play/Sermon/Dinner

4
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,902
The Lord Jesus
was laid in a manger...

5
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,656
...to bring salvation
to the souls of those...

6
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:15,868
...with no place of their own.

7
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,329
Nothing is harder
than to have no place...

8
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:23,417
...but many are those
without one.

9
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:24,877
Tell me about it!

10
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,338
In their solitude,
they long for someone who will say:

11
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,798
"I want you to be here."

12
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,425
Not me, thanks.

13
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:32,718
Be quiet!

14
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:38,473
Jesus was born to offer those alone
a place in which to be alive!

15
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,687
"Joy to the world,
the food has come."

16
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:46,440
Gin! It's "the Lord has come"!

17
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,817
You don't know much, do you?

18
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,528
More than some faggot.

19
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,948
I am a mistake made by God.

20
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,784
In my heart, I am a woman.

21
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,828
Women can have children.

22
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,790
What if a miracle like
the Virgin Mary getting pregnant...

23
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,627
...was to happen to a homo?

24
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:13,300
Better give me a little extra.
After all, I'm eating for two.

25
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,243
Serves you right!

26
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,455
Miyuki!

27
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,667
Time to eat!

28
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:51,755
Miyuki!

29
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,342
Close your legs!
Act like you were a woman.

30
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,677
I am a woman.

31
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,721
And it's a waste
to spill food like that.

32
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,433
Don't just gobble your bread.

33
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,272
Eat it with love for the people
who made and brought it here.

34
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:12,651
I hate that Bible-thumping.
You're just like Akiko.

35
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,319
Who's Akiko?

36
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:17,072
My old lady.

37
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,031
Well!

38
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,117
Don't call your mother that.

39
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,536
Eat shit, you old fart.

40
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,038
"Shit" I'll take, but "fart" I won't!

41
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,040
That hurts! You old...

42
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,251
..."bag lady."

43
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:34,464
You peep pretty loud for a chick
that can't even find its own worms.

44
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,968
Should a burden on society
like you be talking?

45
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:42,139
You're a burden on us.
What does that make you?

46
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:45,893
The kettle the pot's calling black!

47
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,104
You mouthy brat!

48
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,483
Can't you at least get along
at Christmas?

49
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,112
Oh, yes....
Miyuki, I got you a present.

50
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,783
They're gone!

51
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,162
A whole set of
"World Literature for Children."

52
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,748
Why would I need that?!

53
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,666
Hana looked hard for those!

54
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:13,879
Even a homeless teenage runaway
needs a Christmas present!

55
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,382
I choose not to go home.

56
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,011
Six months on the street
means you don't have a home.

57
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,931
I can go home
any time I want to.

58
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:27,684
It's the ones who say that
who never do.

59
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,937
Speak for yourself,
you old geezer!

60
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,273
What are you doing
to Dostoevsky?!

61
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,653
I won't take that,
today of all days!

62
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,115
Not even my father
ever hit me!

63
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,953
So I'll do it for him!

64
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,292
Grow up, will you?!

65
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:54,795
Don't hurt yourselves.

66
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,214
Show more respect, kid!

67
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,966
I'm not a kid!

68
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,635
With little tits like these?

69
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,887
You filthy old pervert!
That's harassment!

70
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,056
Will you two stop!

71
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,060
Huh?

72
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,039
It's been...

73
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,583
...abandoned.

74
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,294
There, there, there.

75
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,424
Care for this child.

76
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,595
What a world!

77
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:46,013
Oh, man!

78
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,601
Oh, my! You're a little girl.
I wonder what your name is.

79
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,394
"John Doe."

80
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,730
She's a girl, I said!
He's so rude!

81
00:05:55,564 --> 00:06:01,111
How old was I when I started
living like this? Thirty-something?

82
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:07,075
I still thought
that I was better off...

83
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,745
...than a child with no home.

84
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:21,798
There, there, now! We'll take you
somewhere warm.

85
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,720
The cop shop's that way!

86
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,058
This is a Christmas present
from God!

87
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,894
She's our baby!

88
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,062
Huh?

Sorry!

99
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:30,450
What do you mean,
take her with us?

100
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,203
I'm just doing God's will.

101
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,372
Her parents might come back.

102
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:39,126
What parent would leave
a child out in this cold?!

103
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,004
That's a devil, not a parent!

104
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:48,302
Kiyoko wanted us
to find her.

105
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,595
"Kiyoko"?

106
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,306
"Kiyoko"? Why "Kiyoko"?!

107
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:56,643
From kiyo, "pure,"
on this purest of nights.

108
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,145
How tacky!

109
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,480
Kiyoko's a fine name!

110
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,983
Did you have
a girlfriend named that?

111
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,484
Idiot!

112
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,656
Look, we can't just name her!
She's not a puppy or a kitten!

113
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,325
So I'm taking her home.

114
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,826
To a cardboard box?

115
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,661
There's no room!

116
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:20,000
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance!
Let me feel like a mother!

117
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,713
A haiku:

118

Directed by
Satoshi Kon

120
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,279
Peek-a-boo!

121
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,534
Oh, dear! Tell me what's wrong!

122
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,285
Shut up!

123
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,123
Hey!

124
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:04,920
I know, I know, he's not your mommy.
He's just a homeless homo.

125
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,798
Don't say that
in front of her!

126
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:11,677
A baby crying around here
will sound weird!

127
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,138
We're going to take you
to the police soon, okay?

128
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,683
You're not going anywhere,
are you?

129
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,519
Idiot! We're taking
her to the police!

130
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,813
Don't shout
or she'll never shut up!

131
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,400
Why won't you stop crying?
Are you hungry?

132
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:27,484
There, there!

133
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:30,112
Maybe she's sick.

134
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:47,504
Tomorrow....
I promise I'll take her then.

135
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:53,177
Christmas should be
the happiest day of the year.

136
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,763
If we take her in now, it'll always be
the worst day of her life!

137
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,558
Maybe...

138
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,186
...she needs a diaper.

139
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,780
Hana, boil some water.

140
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,616
I'll make some milk.

141
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:18,160
Hey! Whose side are you on?!

142
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:22,789
Go buy some water!
My angel isn't drinking from the tap!

143
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,791
Why me?

144
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:30,797
Where does a bum get off telling me
"Them that works eats"?

145
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:37,554
Just for tonight, remember.
Tomorrow we take her to the police.

146
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:43,936
So "no man is an island"
after all, huh?

147
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,192
You're buying water?!

148
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,070
A Christmas miracle.

149
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,697
What a haul!

150
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,498
Watch where you're going, brat!

151
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,500
You watch where you're going!

152
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,631
I was married once.

153
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,424
With a child?

154
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:18,512
No, don't tell me!
I don't want to hear this!

155
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:23,350
You never forget
for one second.

156
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:27,938
A child's the only thing
you hold dearer than life itself.

157
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,732
A boy?

158
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,442
No.

159
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:38,282
Bullshit!

160
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,450
Come on! Give it back!

161
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:45,038
Hey, you're the girl
who hangs out with Gin.

162
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:46,874
Get out of here, will you?

163
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,585
We don't want Gin after us.

164
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,545
Why not?

165
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:55,132
You're the light of his life,
that's why not!

166
00:11:55,674 --> 00:12:00,804
There's not much light
in a cardboard box.

167
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,265
Let me have this book.

168
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:07,811
How old?

169
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,230
Twenty-one, I think.

170
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:14,818
Five or six years older
than Miyuki, I guess.

171
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,820
That old?

172
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:19,406
If she was alive.

173
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:25,621
When I was 20 I got a girl pregnant,
and we got married.

174
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,123
I was in heaven.

175
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:32,336
You could have poked me in the eye
and I'd have just smiled at you.

176
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:38,425
But my daughter got sick,
and the medical bills were huge.

177
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:43,263
I was something of
a bicycle racer then.

178
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:47,518
I needed money.
There was this race....

179
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:48,936
You threw it?

180
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:55,234
A punk I knew
had this scheme.

181
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:01,281
They found out, I got kicked out
of racing, and my girl died.

182
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,701
I just didn't feel
like working anymore.

183
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,038
And then my wife
followed my daughter.

184
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,289
Oh, no!

185
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,168
That's how you get to be
a man like me.

186
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,880
I didn't want to hear that!
I hate sad stories!

187
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,259
It's freezing!

188
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,138
You're used to this.

189
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,515
Kind of.

190
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:29,393
I'll give her the milk.

191
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,229
Dreams do come true.

192
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:37,150
I always dreamed of being
the mother of a little girl.

193
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,570
A nice, warm house,
a pretty daughter.

194
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,406
Even if my husband
was no good...

195
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,576
...I would accept dire poverty
as long as I had my child.

196
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,786
Feed the poor kid!

197
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,668
You're so pretty.

198
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,214
The prettiest little girl
in the world.

199
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:25,741
What do you want?!

200
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,534
They're gone.

201
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,956
Santa Claus, maybe?

202
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:36,293
"Uncle Bag" and the baby
are gone.

203
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,254
What's that faggot
thinking about?!

204
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,551
Man, he's got big feet!

205
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,054
You can't have feet fixed.

206
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,989
Are you taking her back?

207
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,826
There's probably an APB
out on her.

208
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:11,745
And for you.

209
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:12,663
I doubt it.

210
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:17,000
An arrest warrant, maybe.

211
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:21,505
Her parents are probably
sorry about this now.

212
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,049
So let's take her to the police.

213
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,012
A baby's always
better off with its real mother.

214
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:31,014
Not necessarily.

215
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,477
Sometimes a
foster mother's better.

216
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:38,021
-What?!
-Don't be stupid.

217
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:42,025
I never knew
my real mother.

218
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:48,657
But I'll bet if she saw me now,
she'd flip.

219
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:52,870
How can someone homeless
raise a child?

220
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:55,539
I know, I know!

221
00:15:56,582 --> 00:16:00,294
I don't want her shunted
from one foster home to another...

222
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,754
...without even one memory...

223
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,174
...of ever having been loved.

224
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,886
You don't have to be a foundling
to feel that.

225
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,555
They must have had reasons.

226
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,558
Nothing should make you
abandon a child!

227
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:21,148
That means you've taken love
and tossed it away, like trash.

228
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,569
Yeah, but what can we
do about it?

229
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,696
Find her mother.

230
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:32,951
And ask why she abandoned
her baby.

231
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,788
If she can make me understand...

232
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,292
...I'll forgive her,
and my mother too.

233
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,212
Find her?

234
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,047
How?

235
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,094
We'll have to pay again.

236
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:54,765
This is an expensive year-end!

237
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,226
What if we find another baby?

238
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,937
They don't toss them out in twos.

239
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:12,950
Another key!

240
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:17,120
Look at these panties.
You'd catch cold in them!

241
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:20,332
Are they the ones?

242
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,879
Are these your folks?

243
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,215
Look, business cards.

244
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:39,142
A hostess club
won't be open at this hour!

245
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,979
We've got some walking to do.

246
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,398
You've gotta be kidding!

247
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:49,653
He was eating for two!

248
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:08,505
But why pack like you're off on a trip
and then abandon a baby?

249
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:12,301
Maybe it was one last trip
they were taking.

250
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:13,635
A family suicide?!

251
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,597
Then what do we do?

252
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,224
We can't search the next world!

253
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:20,893
Shh!

254
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:30,068
We apologize for
any inconvenience.

255
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:34,823
Trains will be delayed due
to heavy snowfall.

256
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:37,075
It's so hot in here!

257
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:38,994
What a stink!

258
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,539
Have you bathed lately?

259
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:45,125
No. Or washed my clothes.

260
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,002
How embarrassing!

261
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,931
Oh, dear! There, there.

262
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:02,434
Did she piss herself?
That's why it stinks!

263
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:04,311
It's you that stinks!

264
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,521
Quiet!

265
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,564
Shut that kid up!

266
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:23,539
Watch it!

267
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:25,123
Hey!

268
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:35,717
Miyuki!

269
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,553
What's she up to?

270
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,562
We wasted our train fares!

271
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,481
It was me who paid them.

272
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:54,570
I'm sorry!
There's no more milk.

273
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,155
Go ahead, blame it all on me.

274
00:19:57,364 --> 00:20:00,534
Oh, cheer up!
Let's sing a song.

275
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,415
What's that?

276
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,167
The Sound of Music,
of course.

277
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,376
Never heard of it.

278
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,971
That's going to make you
even hungrier.

279
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,815
I'm starving!

280
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,443
I told you!

281
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:37,446
Look after my little angel.

282
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,324
Go on without me.

283
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:44,953
Just say you'll never forget
the queer you once knew.

284
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,789
Look.
A cemetery.

285
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,875
I'm not dead yet!

286
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:05,599
Now I'm alive again!

287
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:11,563
But there's nothing for a baby
in these offerings to the dead!

288
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,732
We'll get by!

289
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,818
Yeah, sure! "We'll get by!"

290
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:20,197
People keep on saying that
till they end up living like us!

291
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:26,203
And while we keep on saying it,
the kid'll end up under a stone here.

292
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,080
"Kiyoko"! She has a name!

293
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:33,085
Yeah, whatever. And she's cute.
She's so pretty.

294
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:36,088
But listen to me. I'm serious.

295
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,840
You listening?

296
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:42,511
If you really care
about that kid...

297
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:45,764
...you'll find her someone
to take care of her.

298
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:48,350
I speak from experience.

299
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,727
That's what her parents said, I bet.

300
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:54,523
What do you mean?
I wouldn't abandon a kid.

301
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:57,067
Don't be stupid!

302
00:21:57,234 --> 00:22:00,195
No. Your family
abandoned you!

303
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,199
There you go again!
Am I going to sit and listen...

304
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:07,327
...while some dumb faggot
pisses on me?

305
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:11,456
What are we doing here?
Tell me.

306
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:13,500
Wracking our brains!

307
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:16,962
We're scavenging offerings
left in a cemetery.

308
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:19,923
And why? Because
we're homeless.

309
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:23,093
-Stop it!
-No! I'm not going to stop.

310
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:26,221
We are three
good-for-nothing bums...

311
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,807
...who can't even
look after ourselves.

312
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:31,143
Shut up! I'm thinking!

313
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,270
I won't shut up.

314
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,650
You can't get milk from an old queer's
tits, no matter how hard you think.

315
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:43,238
Come on, Hana! You know
we can't do this.

316
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,073
Speak for yourself!

317
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:48,452
This way the whole family
will be dead.

318
00:22:57,294 --> 00:22:59,129
Oh, my!

319
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:02,799
You're so lucky, Kiyoko!

320
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:05,135
God must really love you!

321
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:07,596
Then why was she...

322
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:09,139
...dumped?

323
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:11,642
Left!

324
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:15,812
-That's a dead end!
-It's right!

325
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:20,609
-Tails.
-Heads.

326
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:32,704
What's this guy doing
parking like that?

327
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:35,999
Doesn't he know what
a "public thoroughfare" is?

328
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,146
How did that happen?

329
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:04,278
Bad luck. The car got stuck,
and I forgot the parking brake.

330
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,655
Then someone shouted,
"Dorothy, wait!". . .

331
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:08,657
...and then I heard, "Whoops!"...

332
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:12,786
...and the damn car
rolled on top of me.

333
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:20,043
I don't bring my men with me
when I'm visiting the old man's grave.

334
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:24,339
I owe you. Call me
if you're ever in trouble.

335
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,758
Oh, no, we never have
any trouble.

336
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:29,011
You're from Kinshicho?

337
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:31,847
We were just going there.

338
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:34,308
I know it's rude to ask....

339
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,518
If it's rude, then don't ask.

340
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:38,187
Come on.

341
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:42,357
Would you know
this establishment?

342
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:43,901
Club Swirl: "Midori"

343
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,778
Know it?

344
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:51,783
Its owner's marrying
my daughter today.

345
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:57,873
He's one of my men,
but he's too cocky.

346
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:00,417
I was against it.

347
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,753
But your daughter chose him.

348
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:06,757
The daughter I brought up,
married to a man like that....

349
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:09,468
Know what I mean?

350
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:14,681
But if your daughter's
happy with him...

351
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:16,725
...isn't that the main thing?

352
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:17,893
You're right!

353
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:25,108
I went to the old man's grave
so I wouldn't cry at the wedding.

354
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,110
Watch the road!

355
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:34,326
Good evening, sir!

356
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,288
Make yourselves at home.

357
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:53,011
Daddy, you're late!

358
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,099
Sorry, sorry.
I almost got killed.

359
00:25:57,266 --> 00:26:00,227
I owe them my life.

360
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:01,895
My daughter, Kiyoko.

361
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:03,313
Oh. Hello.

362
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:16,743
What have you gotten us into?!

363
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,204
Just shut up and eat!

364
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:25,586
Diaper change.
Your turn, Miyuki.

365
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:38,265
Don't you think Kiyoko
has amazing luck?

366
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:41,810
Yeah.

367
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,479
Maybe she does.

368
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:50,652
Oh, yeah. Her name's Sachiko.

369
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:52,487
Not "Midori"?

370
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:54,198
Just at the club.

371
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:57,159
She's Sachiko, "happy child,"
though she didn't look it.

372
00:26:57,326 --> 00:27:02,331
But some plastic surgery
turned her into a good little earner.

373
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:06,668
She quit.
Said she was pregnant.

374
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:08,837
Do you know where she is?

375
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:12,257
I doubt you'll wring
any money out of her.

376
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:15,761
No, I have something
to give her.

377
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:23,060
I'm sorry
I spilled your food.

378
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:26,688
You remember her?
Midori, the skinny broad.

379
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,692
She said her husband
was in debt.

380
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,945
What's wrong with you?

381
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:34,363
That bastard.

382
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,740
Do you know him?

383
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,201
Then she borrowed
more money from us...

384
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:42,496
...and ended up screwed both ways.

385
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:44,748
You know where she is?

386
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:46,291
If it weren't for his
damn get-rich-quick scheme...

387
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:49,127
If it weren't for his
damn get-rich-quick scheme...

388
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:52,047
...I'd still be with
my wife and kid!

389
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:54,800
But aren't they both dead?

390
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:57,135
I'll kill the bastard!

391
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:00,305
You'll get killed!

392
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:28,542
Mitsuo! Mitsuo!

393
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:31,003
It was that maid!

394
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,046
Are you okay?!

395
00:28:34,131 --> 00:28:35,465
She's got a gun!

396
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:38,177
Hey, what--?!

397
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:45,017
Kiyoko! Miyuki!

398
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:47,102
Hey!

399
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:11,835
Thank you very much.

400
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:15,047
She's got a gun, you know!

401
00:29:15,214 --> 00:29:18,675
-Our lives are already wasted!
-Hana!

402
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:25,057
There!

403
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:54,962
Yes! One of your cabs picked up
a young woman with a baby.

404
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:58,048
Number 1 2-25. Send it to...

405
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:02,135
...the Tokyo Tower.
My name is--

406
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:07,266
Hey! Wait a minute.

407
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:16,275
We're homeless bums,
not action-movie heroes.

408
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:18,735
What we need now
is the police.

409
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:24,700
If you like the police so much,
get them to adopt you!

410
00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:27,578
Those children are like family!

411
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:29,746
I thought I could
depend on you!

412
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,458
Don't talk like you were
my damn wife.

413
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:37,296
I'm not going anywhere.

414
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:38,630
Gin!

415
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:41,216
We've done all we could.

416
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:42,551
You're giving up?

417
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:46,388
There's nothing we can do.

418
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,600
You are really
the lowest of the low!

419
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:52,895
The best thing you'll ever do
is die in the gutter!

420
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:56,732
Oh, poor you! You'll be dead
and no one'll care!

421
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,818
All you ever do is
cause people trouble!

422
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:02,571
Dead or alive, you're living trash!

423
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:05,449
The king of trash!

424
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:13,999
Okay, so I'm trash.
But you're ugly.

425
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:33,477
-Yes?
-I want to get rid of some trash.

426
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:41,235
I don't think I'd fit.

427
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:46,990
Yeah, that's what I am,
living trash!

428
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:52,830
Who cares if you die
in the gutter?

429
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:57,668
You're dead all the same.

430
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:21,817
You okay?

431
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:24,945
Hang in there, Gramps.

432
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:30,742
-May I make one last request?
-What?

433
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:34,746
Give me a drink of that.

434
00:33:25,464 --> 00:33:28,091
You're not selling me
into slavery!

435
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:32,221
Somebody, help!

436
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:50,572
I always wanted to die drunk,
in a nice old house.

437
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:53,784
Now I'm halfway there.

438
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:56,161
Fate works in strange ways.

439
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:59,957
I've lived a long time...

440
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:03,710
...but I'm just trash,
as worthless dead as alive.

441
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:06,171
Don't talk like that!

442
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:11,176
You remind me of myself
when I was younger.

443
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:14,179
Looking at you now...

444
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:17,683
...may I make a last request?

445
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:21,270
Get rid of this for me.

446
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:27,192
Some people will be hurt
if it's known who I am.

447
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:31,029
Okay. I understand.
No one will ever know.

448
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:49,256
Take care of yourself, okay?
May I make a last...?

449
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:51,216
Request?

450
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,641
And now, goodbye.

451
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:16,033
That's it!

452
00:35:19,203 --> 00:35:20,996
Thanks, Gramps!

453
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:29,588
Time for the New Year's clean-up!

454
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,806
Big breasts.... Cool!

455
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:54,863
Husband?

456
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:11,088
Father--

457
00:36:11,922 --> 00:36:12,923
Police.

458
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,925
Your dad's a cop?!

459
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:16,635
My father was a policeman!

460
00:36:17,052 --> 00:36:18,512
Father, policeman?

461
00:36:21,014 --> 00:36:26,520
Except I'm the one
he's going to be arresting.

462
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:42,494
Hold it.

463
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:48,125
Hi! How've you been?

464
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:52,546
Now? Just cleaning up.

465
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:55,007
Hey, wake up!

466
00:36:55,174 --> 00:36:56,258
Come on!

467
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,763
No! Not that!

468
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:04,683
Time to die, old man!

469
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:08,020
Kiyo's coming? I'm there!

470
00:37:08,687 --> 00:37:10,856
The girls are drinking near here.

471
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:12,608
Yeah?

472
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:16,028
All cleaned up.

473
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:21,617
Give it back!

474
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,120
Give me that back!

475
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:31,335
Her foreigner husband looked like
he was in a real bad mood.

476
00:37:32,085 --> 00:37:33,295
Did he hit her?

477
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:36,798
No, she was being real nice
for a girl so young.

478
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:40,219
My wife could learn something!

479
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,640
His foreign assailant fled, taking
a young woman and a baby hostage.

480
00:37:44,806 --> 00:37:49,686
With the groom in serious condition,
police speculate this may be a war...

481
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,231
...between crime syndicates.

482
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:55,526
Hey, this is serious!

483
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:57,736
I'm not kidding around, either!

484
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:06,286
My mom's religious.

485
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:08,580
She chants all the time.

486
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:15,629
Me.

487
00:38:20,217 --> 00:38:21,802
Isn't she cute?

488
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:25,514
I found her. Those spots
on her back look like wings.

489
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:27,307
So I called her "Angel."

490
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:31,228
But she's gone.

491
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:35,524
Father.

492
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:48,078
I stabbed my father.

493
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,831
I can never go back.

494
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:20,110
The baby? A gift from God.

495
00:39:20,277 --> 00:39:21,153
Yes.

496
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:24,698
Give me a break!

497
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:26,783
I've got a family at home!

498
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,369
Those children are my family!

499
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:32,664
They went in there.

500
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:34,208
Hey! The fare!

501
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:35,667
I'll be right back.

502
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:38,212
Miyuki! Kiyoko!

503
00:39:39,505 --> 00:39:41,465
Miyuki! Kiyoko!

504
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:43,300
Where are you?

505
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:53,393
Kiyoko! Miyuki!

506
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,621
How could you do this to me?!

507
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:15,582
It's your own fault!

508
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:19,503
You never listen
to anything I say!

509
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,713
Use the scarf I made you...

510
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:23,674
...to mop up the blood!

511
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:25,217
What have you done
with Angel?!

512
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:28,136
Where is she?
Where is my Angel?

513
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:30,180
She's right here.

514
00:40:30,472 --> 00:40:31,890
Our angel.

515
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:35,936
I'm hungry.

516
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:37,604
Make me some food.

517
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:39,690
Why?

518
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:42,609
What are you doing in my house?

519
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:46,947
Miyuki, take Kiyoko.
I'll get dinner.

520
00:40:57,332 --> 00:41:02,129
Kiyoko! Miyuki!

521
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:08,468
Uncle Bag?!

522
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:15,893
Oh, I've missed you,
my little angel!

523
00:41:19,646 --> 00:41:23,400
I wish I was her mother,
but I'm just another homo.

524
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:25,527
Miyuki...

525
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:28,864
...I'm so glad you're safe.

526
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:39,041
Where's the geezer?

527
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:42,544
He could be dead
for all I care!

528
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:47,674
I'm dying.

529
00:41:57,518 --> 00:41:59,895
Maybe he went home.

530
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:01,313
Who cares?

531
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:03,982
All he thinks about
is himself.

532
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,155
Yeah, Miss Hana, but you're
in love with him, aren't you?

533
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:14,243
Don't be silly! I like my men
to be more "manly."

534
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:19,873
The kind of man I like is
slender, middle-aged, tanned...

535
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,502
...with a divine square-back haircut
and a lower-town accent...

536
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,713
...who says, "Ah, what the hell"...

537
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,092
...when I don't quite have
the cab fare.

538
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:35,806
So, what now, Miss Hana?

539
00:42:35,973 --> 00:42:40,185
Why are you calling me that?
"Uncle Bag" is fine.

540
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:42,563
It's hard to say.

541
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:51,071
I'm glad.

542
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:55,200
He just died there?

543
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:56,785
He was homeless.

544
00:42:56,952 --> 00:42:58,412
I might be next.

545
00:42:58,579 --> 00:42:59,746
Just do your job.

546
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:01,957
Gin!

547
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:07,087
Gin! Gin!

548
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:09,298
Take it easy.

549
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:10,424
Gin!

550
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:12,134
Calm down!

551
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:24,354
Where is that man of mine?!

552
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,068
Kiyo....

553
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:35,741
If only tonight...

554
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:41,371
...I wanted to see you
before I died.

555
00:43:43,957 --> 00:43:46,585
Kiyoko!

556
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:05,979
What is your desire?
My magic, or an ambulance?

557
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:09,983
-An ambulance.
-Well! Aren't you rude!

558
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:15,489
What are we going to do?
Kiyoko can't sleep out on the street!

559
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:19,785
The geezer's not here,
we're freezing, sleepy, hungry.

560
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:21,495
This sucks!

561
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:24,790
I guess there's no choice.

562
00:44:30,546 --> 00:44:33,090
I never thought
I'd be here again.

563
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:43,684
I'm sorry. We're closed for
a private party tonight--

564
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:47,145
Hana?!

565
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:51,567
I know I have no right
to come strolling in now...

566
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:55,612
...but there's no one else
I can call on, "Mother"!

567
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:01,827
Hana!

568
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:03,829
Mother!

569
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:05,372
Hana!

570
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:14,047
Geezer?!

571
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:19,219
What happened, Gin?!

572
00:45:21,597 --> 00:45:24,183
Some kids beat me up.

573
00:45:25,142 --> 00:45:28,103
I guess I'm just not
an action hero.

574
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:35,110
He said he knew you.

575
00:45:35,444 --> 00:45:38,530
But he said he was homeless,
you know.

576
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:40,949
So am I.

577
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:44,786
What? But why?!

578
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,332
Since Ken died I'm like a canary...

579
00:45:48,499 --> 00:45:50,792
...that's forgotten its song.

580
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:53,504
You sing all the time!

581
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,256
Isn't she cute?!

582
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:58,008
I wish I could have one!

583
00:46:03,388 --> 00:46:06,892
So Ken died, did he?

584
00:46:09,102 --> 00:46:10,354
AIDS?

585
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:13,273
He slipped on the soap.

586
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,402
Well, death is always
a hair's breadth away.

587
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:22,032
But if you were in trouble,
why didn't you come back?

588
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:28,205
We certainly had fun here,
didn't we?

589
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:32,459
In this old bar

590
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:36,255
I've had so much to drink

591
00:46:37,172 --> 00:46:39,258
My old memories

592
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:44,221
All start to blur

593
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:46,890
My lover

594
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:50,352
Has left me

595
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:56,817
People call me notorious

596
00:46:56,984 --> 00:46:58,819
Aw, you're ugly!

597
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:01,738
Good for nothing

598
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:02,739
Get off!

599
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:05,617
Good for nothing

600
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:10,289
What a terrible thing to say

601
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:12,916
Eat shit, you old fart!

602
00:47:14,543 --> 00:47:18,630
"Shit" I'll take, but "fart" I won't!

603
00:47:25,637 --> 00:47:28,807
I couldn't come back
after I'd done that.

604
00:47:29,224 --> 00:47:33,103
A little bit of money
took care of that.

605
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:36,064
I'm just happy you're all right.

606
00:47:38,233 --> 00:47:41,945
Stop it! You scare me
when you start crying.

607
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:47,868
What about that baby?
Is the girl its mother?

608
00:47:48,035 --> 00:47:49,286
Well....

609
00:47:52,706 --> 00:47:56,210
Where is your mother, anyway?

610
00:47:57,252 --> 00:47:58,378
Abandoned?!

611
00:47:58,545 --> 00:48:01,965
Yes! I've been abandoned!

612
00:48:04,468 --> 00:48:07,137
Them's the breaks, I guess.

613
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:11,058
I could see me in her.

614
00:48:11,308 --> 00:48:15,521
Born on the street,
and back there again.

615
00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:21,652
That's why I want to find her
a home full of love!

616
00:48:21,819 --> 00:48:26,240
All I ever wanted was love!

617
00:48:33,372 --> 00:48:34,248
Ow!

618
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:42,756
What the hell?!

619
00:48:45,384 --> 00:48:47,886
The geezer's come out.

620
00:48:48,095 --> 00:48:49,429
Where are my clothes?!

621
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:01,108
Way to go, Gin!

622
00:49:02,901 --> 00:49:05,112
Come back any time.

623
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:08,657
Thank you, Mother.

624
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:18,250
My mother's white breath / as she
watches me set out / on a long journey.

625
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:36,411
Oh, man!

626
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:40,332
An empty building's always nice,
but look who got here first.

627
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:47,422
I'd just love to fill up
on some meat!

628
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:49,883
Don't you dare!

629
00:50:51,552 --> 00:50:54,054
Just kidding!

630
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:02,229
The snow's let up.
Miyuki, will you go shopping?

631
00:51:02,396 --> 00:51:03,397
Okay.

632
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:05,774
Get me some sake.

633
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,110
Just one.

634
00:51:26,128 --> 00:51:28,422
-No!
-I wish.

635
00:51:45,606 --> 00:51:46,940
"Honey, I'm home."

636
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:10,881
You stayed in there?
You'd think you were homeless!

637
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:18,680
Actually, we're looking for
these people.

638
00:52:20,182 --> 00:52:22,434
Sachiko Nishizawa.

639
00:52:22,893 --> 00:52:24,144
Do you know her?

640
00:52:24,645 --> 00:52:28,357
She never paid me back for her
Neighborhood Association dues.

641
00:52:28,524 --> 00:52:30,859
Are you a relative?

642
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:35,572
No! We're acquaintances
of a relative.

643
00:52:35,948 --> 00:52:38,158
Her husband was no better.

644
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:42,788
Gambling day and night,
and mean when he drank.

645
00:52:44,832 --> 00:52:47,960
Living on his wife's earnings
and borrowed money.

646
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:49,920
Where are they now?

647
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:53,715
I wouldn't know.
Mrs. Kurumizawa might.

648
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:57,719
They left
about three months ago.

649
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:05,185
The house was seized for debt.
One night they just up and went.

650
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:09,148
They were a nice couple
at first...

651
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:13,277
...but it wasn't long before
they started fighting.

652
00:53:13,443 --> 00:53:15,445
That's poverty for you.

653
00:53:15,612 --> 00:53:19,908
All that debt didn't stop him
from lording it over her.

654
00:53:20,075 --> 00:53:23,662
Even the most dedicated wife
has her limits.

655
00:53:24,788 --> 00:53:26,832
You'd see bruises sometimes.

656
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,792
The poor woman.

657
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,503
Not on her, on him!

658
00:53:31,712 --> 00:53:32,880
Oh, dear!

659
00:53:33,589 --> 00:53:40,345
But his mother would always take
his side against her.

660
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:44,224
His parents built them this house.

661
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:46,310
Where do they live?

662
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:48,729
Mrs. Yamanouchi might know.

663
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:53,192
Her mother-in-law
was always complaining...

664
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,527
...that she never did
any housework.

665
00:53:55,736 --> 00:53:57,946
But her son was perfect,
of course.

666
00:53:58,113 --> 00:54:00,782
Of course!
That's why I told her...

667
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:05,037
...she'd never see a grandchild
with his wife working in a club.

668
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:08,373
But she did get pregnant.

669
00:54:08,582 --> 00:54:10,834
Well, a man and a woman....

670
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:12,586
They can always find time...

671
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:14,880
...to do what they must!

672
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:18,550
Shinkocho 1 -2-25
Maison Happiness Apt. 203

673
00:54:19,843 --> 00:54:22,179
What if they ran out
from this new place too?

674
00:54:22,346 --> 00:54:24,765
What a horrible man!

675
00:54:25,015 --> 00:54:30,229
Poor Sachiko! Working to pay off
her husband's gambling debts!

676
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:31,647
Right!

677
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:36,443
But I never thought of
abandoning the kid!

678
00:54:36,819 --> 00:54:38,987
-Huh?
-Nothing.

679
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:43,242
That's no reason
to just dump the kid!

680
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:45,077
I've said that all along.

681
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:52,626
Miyuki: Angel has
come home. Dad.

682
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:00,050
Doesn't it ever get tired
of snowing?

683
00:55:02,553 --> 00:55:04,471
Thank you.

684
00:55:14,064 --> 00:55:17,484
I wonder how we look
to them.

685
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:20,320
Like a bum, a homo,
a runaway and a foundling.

686
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:24,283
Kiyoko is God's messenger.
We're her servants.

687
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:27,828
Unpaid servants.

688
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:31,248
Paying for a father's sins.

689
00:55:31,415 --> 00:55:34,626
Yeah, if her father had been
any good at all...

690
00:55:34,835 --> 00:55:37,171
...we wouldn't be going
through all this.

691
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:43,969
Even a good-for-nothing father
never forgets a child.

692
00:55:46,054 --> 00:55:47,556
I'm going out.

693
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:54,688
What's the matter with her?

694
00:55:54,855 --> 00:55:58,358
A child never forgets
its parents.

695
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:06,033
I never stop wanting...

696
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:09,828
...to see my daughter, just once.

697
00:56:10,037 --> 00:56:12,080
So she's alive?

698
00:56:12,456 --> 00:56:13,624
Yeah.

699
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:14,958
And your wife?

700
00:56:16,251 --> 00:56:18,462
I'm sure she's remarried...

701
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:21,340
...and living happily.

702
00:56:26,345 --> 00:56:27,429
"Hello.

703
00:56:27,971 --> 00:56:29,598
It's me, Miyuki."

704
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:32,309
Why did you split up?

705
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,645
-Drinking and gambling.
-What?!

706
00:56:35,896 --> 00:56:37,231
Just like....

707
00:56:38,315 --> 00:56:40,609
I'm a louse.

708
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:46,865
But I've always wanted to do
something for her as a father...

709
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:48,617
...even just a little.

710
00:56:49,493 --> 00:56:53,121
When I was gambling
this would have been nothing.

711
00:56:53,539 --> 00:56:57,042
Now I've had to sweat blood
just to save 30,000 yen.

712
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:59,378
That's great, Gin!

713
00:56:59,753 --> 00:57:01,380
We can stuff ourselves!

714
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:03,090
Stuff you!

715
00:57:12,808 --> 00:57:14,142
Ishida speaking.

716
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:26,071
Miyuki? Is that you?

717
00:57:28,407 --> 00:57:29,575
Are you all right?

718
00:57:35,581 --> 00:57:37,040
I'm sorry!

719
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:38,834
I'm sorry!

720
00:57:39,459 --> 00:57:41,253
I'm sorry!

721
00:57:43,463 --> 00:57:45,966
Excuse me,
but if you wouldn't mind....

722
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:47,759
"Get out," you mean?

723
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:51,638
Other customers
might like to sit down.

724
00:57:51,889 --> 00:57:53,307
There's hardly anyone here!

725
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:55,100
You guys stink!

726
00:57:55,851 --> 00:57:59,438
What are you?
Homeless or something?

727
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:04,109
Does trash have kids too?
Just like real people?

728
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:06,945
Who are you looking at?

729
00:58:09,156 --> 00:58:10,449
Hold it, you!

730
00:58:11,325 --> 00:58:12,826
Sir! No!

731
00:58:12,993 --> 00:58:14,995
Hold it, I said, you low-life!

732
00:58:25,047 --> 00:58:28,509
It's New Year's Sale time
at The Food Store!

733
00:58:28,842 --> 00:58:35,224
Come to The Food Store
for all your special New Year's needs!

734
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:38,060
See in the New Year
with your family!

735
00:58:38,227 --> 00:58:40,020
Call an ambulance, quick.

736
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:42,147
Right!

737
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:50,072
I knew it! Kiyoko really is
the messenger of God!

738
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:53,033
Hey!

739
00:58:54,034 --> 00:58:54,535
Miss Hana!

740
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:56,119
Hey!

741
00:58:56,286 --> 00:58:57,329
Hana!

742
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,431
Following a recent
gangland shooting incident...

743
00:59:16,598 --> 00:59:22,187
...police are seeking a fugitive
thought to be Latin American.

744
00:59:22,813 --> 00:59:25,524
Mitsuo Hiruta, shot three times...

745
00:59:25,691 --> 00:59:29,528
...in protecting the leader
of his syndicate...

746
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:35,075
...will be questioned after he recovers
from his wounds.

747
00:59:35,951 --> 00:59:39,538
Isn't she cute!
When was she born?

748
00:59:39,746 --> 00:59:42,708
Not long ago, I guess.

749
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:44,626
So the mother....

750
00:59:44,793 --> 00:59:46,378
I'm not.

751
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,714
What's her name?

752
00:59:48,881 --> 00:59:49,298
Kiyoko.

753
00:59:49,464 --> 00:59:53,385
That's my name too.
What a coincidence.

754
00:59:56,096 --> 00:59:58,390
Your friend is very weak.

755
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:01,477
Make sure he gets rest
and proper nutrition.

756
01:00:01,643 --> 01:00:02,895
Doctor!

757
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:06,231
Believe it or not,
we're homeless.

758
01:00:06,398 --> 01:00:08,609
I'm just a doctor.

759
01:00:10,027 --> 01:00:15,574
Rest and nutrition don't fit
with our lifestyle, you realize.

760
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:22,623
I can try to cure disease.
Lifestyle is something you have to fix.

761
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:26,084
All anyone can do is their best.

762
01:00:28,462 --> 01:00:30,255
Take care.

763
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,929
The bill for today is 29,830 yen.

764
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:41,308
Bring your health-insurance card
and you'll get a refund.

765
01:00:42,476 --> 01:00:44,937
I'm sorry, Gin!

766
01:00:45,687 --> 01:00:49,274
Stop crying! You'll get
the bills all wet.

767
01:00:49,983 --> 01:00:51,985
That's 30,000 yen.

768
01:01:08,252 --> 01:01:09,545
Kiyoko?!

769
01:01:14,591 --> 01:01:15,634
Dad?

770
01:01:38,574 --> 01:01:40,659
So you took up nursing.

771
01:01:41,952 --> 01:01:44,163
I see.

772
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,417
I'm glad you're well.

773
01:01:48,584 --> 01:01:54,006
Oh, yeah, I'm just great.
How's your mother?

774
01:01:54,214 --> 01:01:55,424
Fine.

775
01:01:56,341 --> 01:01:58,510
Yeah? That's good.

776
01:01:59,136 --> 01:02:00,846
What are you doing now?

777
01:02:01,013 --> 01:02:07,269
I'm in recycling.
I had to drop something off here.

778
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:13,025
You must hate me.

779
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:18,572
I was never any kind
of a father to you.

780
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:24,870
But that 30,000 yen was money
I'd saved up for you.

781
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:27,873
You may not believe it.

782
01:02:31,293 --> 01:02:34,546
I always wanted to see you.

783
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:39,968
When I was little,
Mom and I searched for you.

784
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,888
We even checked
unidentified corpses.

785
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:48,227
After you disappeared,
Mom ran the store herself.

786
01:02:49,686 --> 01:02:50,437
The store?

787
01:02:50,604 --> 01:02:54,775
It was hard for a woman to run
a bicycle shop alone.

788
01:02:55,776 --> 01:02:58,779
That's not quite the same as
a bicycle racer.

789
01:02:59,029 --> 01:03:05,160
The man you owed money to was shot
and wounded the other day, you know.

790
01:03:05,327 --> 01:03:06,745
He lived?!

791
01:03:07,788 --> 01:03:09,832
That's a relief.

792
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:11,959
I thought you'd say that.

793
01:03:14,837 --> 01:03:19,758
I ran up the debts, not him.

794
01:03:21,385 --> 01:03:25,931
Thank that doctor for me.
He seems like a nice guy.

795
01:03:26,849 --> 01:03:29,268
I'm getting married.

796
01:03:31,145 --> 01:03:32,855
Oh? That's good.

797
01:03:33,021 --> 01:03:34,273
To him.

798
01:03:34,439 --> 01:03:38,861
Great! But isn't he
about my age?

799
01:03:39,528 --> 01:03:43,282
He's been married.
His daughter got sick and died...

800
01:03:43,824 --> 01:03:46,118
...and his wife followed her.

801
01:03:51,373 --> 01:03:53,125
That man makes me so mad!

802
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:54,918
Aren't you moved?

803
01:03:55,836 --> 01:03:58,630
Here's the address
and phone number.

804
01:03:58,797 --> 01:03:59,715
Yours?

805
01:03:59,882 --> 01:04:02,301
The old house is gone.

806
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:04,845
Even if you can't now,
call me sometime.

807
01:04:06,054 --> 01:04:08,390
Kiyoko!

808
01:04:10,434 --> 01:04:14,521
I've had about
all I can stand!

809
01:04:14,688 --> 01:04:15,481
Miss Hana?

810
01:04:15,689 --> 01:04:18,358
Telling us you were a racer!

811
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:21,361
I was always at the track.

812
01:04:21,528 --> 01:04:22,863
Yeah, betting!

813
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:27,326
And your debts snowballed
so you couldn't face your family...

814
01:04:27,493 --> 01:04:29,369
...and you ran and hid
in a cardboard box!

815
01:04:29,536 --> 01:04:31,246
Yes, damn it!

816
01:04:31,413 --> 01:04:33,874
That's what your father is!

817
01:04:34,374 --> 01:04:38,003
He can't bet, he's spineless,
his feet stink and he can't drink!

818
01:04:38,212 --> 01:04:42,049
He kills off his wife and daughter
to buy sympathy!

819
01:04:42,216 --> 01:04:45,052
He said you had
an incurable disease!

820
01:04:45,219 --> 01:04:50,390
With a father like that,
you have my sympathy!

821
01:04:50,724 --> 01:04:53,685
Is this how you repay me?!

822
01:04:54,061 --> 01:04:55,771
Repay you?!

823
01:04:55,938 --> 01:04:57,856
Am I hearing right?

824
01:04:58,065 --> 01:05:00,192
If we're talking about debt,
I'm waiting for my change!

825
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,861
Debt's a concept
you don't even understand!

826
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:06,532
You understand how to troll
through garbage cans!

827
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:09,576
And how to get in debt
and how to make babies.

828
01:05:09,743 --> 01:05:13,288
Though you're not too good
at raising them, are you?

829
01:05:13,455 --> 01:05:16,375
And your debts
you shove off on your wife.

830
01:05:16,542 --> 01:05:19,920
Always running away,
never doing anything right!

831
01:05:20,087 --> 01:05:22,798
Running away's
the only racing you ever did!

832
01:05:22,965 --> 01:05:26,051
Miyuki! We're leaving!

833
01:05:28,929 --> 01:05:30,055
Miss Hana?

834
01:05:35,602 --> 01:05:37,604
I guess he's better.

835
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:41,984
Should you have said that
in front of her?

836
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:48,073
If she's his daughter,
she'll forgive him.

837
01:05:50,993 --> 01:05:54,246
Being able to speak freely...

838
01:05:54,413 --> 01:05:57,249
...is the lifeblood of love.

839
01:05:58,292 --> 01:05:59,793
Maybe I'm na:i:ve.

840
01:06:02,671 --> 01:06:05,007
So you're in love with him?

841
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:08,635
Don't be silly.
I'm the Weeping Red Devil.

842
01:06:08,802 --> 01:06:09,469
What?

843
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:12,848
It's a story I love.

844
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:18,353
There was a red devil who
wanted to be friends with people.

845
01:06:19,313 --> 01:06:24,026
But since he was a devil,
no one would go near him.

846
01:06:24,193 --> 01:06:27,863
So his friend the blue devil
made a plan.

847
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:34,495
He'd wreak havoc among the people,
and the red devil would save them.

848
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:43,295
When you try to achieve something,
someone's bound to get hurt.

849
01:06:44,338 --> 01:06:46,673
You always have to
sacrifice something.

850
01:06:47,508 --> 01:06:49,635
The plan worked.

851
01:06:49,843 --> 01:06:54,723
But the blue devil had to go away
so they'd never know it was a trick.

852
01:06:57,559 --> 01:06:59,144
It's a sad story.

853
01:06:59,353 --> 01:07:03,524
But that means you leave.
Where will you go?

854
01:07:04,525 --> 01:07:07,861
It's best for everyone
when they're with their family.

855
01:07:08,028 --> 01:07:10,030
Soon we'll find Kiyoko's mother.

856
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:14,535
And then what?
You don't have a real family!

857
01:07:24,545 --> 01:07:27,881
Rare "Line Of Ones" Wins Lottery

858
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:32,678
Numbers have been drawn for the
annual New Year's Jumbo Lottery.

859
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:36,640
Top prize in the 200-million-yen
lottery is a very rare number.

860
01:07:37,391 --> 01:07:41,520
Group 1 1, number 1 1 1, 1 1 1...

861
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:44,439
...is worth 50 million yen.

862
01:07:45,107 --> 01:07:46,400
A different group pays 1 00,000 yen.

863
01:07:47,526 --> 01:07:50,863
To repeat,
the winning prize number is....

864
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:54,366
This just in.

865
01:07:54,825 --> 01:07:58,412
Police have released a sketch
of an infant taken...

866
01:07:58,579 --> 01:08:02,374
...from a hospital in
Tokyo's Shinagawa Ward.

867
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:09,715
We've come all the way here,
but we don't have her address!

868
01:08:09,882 --> 01:08:12,426
The geezer's got it!
Let's go back.

869
01:08:12,593 --> 01:08:14,928
Where are you going?

870
01:08:16,513 --> 01:08:20,726
-The police!
-What? You hated that idea!

871
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:23,604
I was just ego-tripping.

872
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:27,566
Now I want to apologize
to her parents.

873
01:08:27,774 --> 01:08:32,070
They might not be able to sleep
waiting for news about her.

874
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:35,908
That's what we said
from the very start!

875
01:08:36,116 --> 01:08:40,245
They might even be
about to commit suicide!

876
01:08:40,412 --> 01:08:43,916
I've done something
that can't be taken back!

877
01:08:44,124 --> 01:08:46,585
I'll throw myself in this river.

878
01:08:46,793 --> 01:08:50,923
I'll step neatly out of my shoes, stand
on the handrail, and be at peace.

879
01:08:51,131 --> 01:08:54,134
But then I'll see
a baby's face on the water.

880
01:08:54,301 --> 01:08:59,014
No! While I see this child's face,
I cannot die!

881
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:00,933
Hey, you!

882
01:09:01,141 --> 01:09:02,351
No!

883
01:09:04,686 --> 01:09:05,813
You're too young for this!

884
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:08,106
Please! Let me die!

885
01:09:15,739 --> 01:09:17,282
You!

886
01:09:18,075 --> 01:09:19,284
Sachiko Nishizawa.

887
01:09:23,831 --> 01:09:25,791
What were you thinking of?!

888
01:09:25,999 --> 01:09:28,001
Is that an apology?

889
01:09:28,168 --> 01:09:32,297
If we hadn't found this child,
she would've frozen to death!

890
01:09:32,506 --> 01:09:33,799
It wasn't me!

891
01:09:34,007 --> 01:09:37,177
My husband took her away
when I wasn't there!

892
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:41,140
I've looked and looked!

893
01:09:48,355 --> 01:09:49,523
Is that true?

894
01:09:52,693 --> 01:09:57,865
All I've suffered
on account of that man!

895
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:12,045
"Hi, Mom!"

896
01:10:20,095 --> 01:10:23,682
God really loves this child,
you know.

897
01:10:24,057 --> 01:10:27,186
I want you to give her
lots of love too.

898
01:10:27,603 --> 01:10:30,522
Do right by her,
or you'll pay for it.

899
01:10:30,689 --> 01:10:32,524
I'm so sorry!

900
01:10:32,733 --> 01:10:33,942
I'm sorry!

901
01:10:43,952 --> 01:10:45,579
Mrs. Nishizawa!

902
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:33,252
What are you doing in here?!

903
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:35,754
Get out of here! Get out!

904
01:11:36,338 --> 01:11:38,298
Wait! I'm no thief.

905
01:11:38,465 --> 01:11:40,801
You're lying! Get out!

906
01:11:40,968 --> 01:11:42,094
Where's the baby?!

907
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:48,809
Did an old queer and a girl
come to give it back?

908
01:11:48,976 --> 01:11:50,519
What are you talking about?!

909
01:11:50,686 --> 01:11:52,813
You abandoned a baby!

910
01:11:55,023 --> 01:11:57,109
I can prove it.

911
01:11:57,568 --> 01:11:59,653
Are you a cop?

912
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:04,449
Huh? I'm just a bum
who was passing by.

913
01:12:05,659 --> 01:12:07,619
Are you right in the head?

914
01:12:07,828 --> 01:12:09,955
I'm damn near crazy
from all this!

915
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:15,460
Why is the baby you abandoned
on the news as being "taken away"?

916
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:18,130
They'll call us kidnappers!

917
01:12:18,672 --> 01:12:22,759
It wasn't me.
That's not my kid.

918
01:12:25,345 --> 01:12:26,305
What?

919
01:12:28,182 --> 01:12:30,392
There, there! Don't cry!

920
01:12:30,559 --> 01:12:31,643
Take care.

921
01:12:32,352 --> 01:12:33,979
Raise her right.

922
01:12:34,146 --> 01:12:36,231
See you again someday.

923
01:12:37,858 --> 01:12:40,486
Never leave her again.

924
01:13:03,383 --> 01:13:10,891
On the year's last day / when all of a
life's accounts / have been settled up.

925
01:13:21,068 --> 01:13:25,864
Sachiko stole that baby
out of the hospital.

926
01:13:26,073 --> 01:13:30,285
She stole a baby
and then abandoned it?!

927
01:13:30,452 --> 01:13:32,371
That's a person's life!

928
01:13:32,538 --> 01:13:35,123
She lied to me about it!

929
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:38,544
And now it's gone
way out of control.

930
01:13:38,919 --> 01:13:43,382
I don't want anything to do with it!
Take the kid to the police!

931
01:13:43,549 --> 01:13:44,967
What?!

932
01:13:46,093 --> 01:13:48,887
Don't act like
you're not part of this!

933
01:13:49,096 --> 01:13:52,224
You don't want to get involved?
You're her husband!

934
01:13:52,641 --> 01:13:56,770
That's all over!
I'm getting my life back together.

935
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:57,729
Look!

936
01:13:57,938 --> 01:14:01,733
I won 1 00,000 yen in the lottery.
My luck's turned!

937
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:11,243
I know a guy just like you.
He threw away his life and his family.

938
01:14:11,618 --> 01:14:13,745
No. They threw him away.

939
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:15,998
I'm no loser!

940
01:14:20,878 --> 01:14:23,088
These were in your wife's bag.

941
01:14:25,465 --> 01:14:28,760
Any idea where
she might have gone?

942
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:32,264
She said she was going
to be with her baby.

943
01:14:32,806 --> 01:14:35,601
She was going to kill herself!

944
01:14:37,478 --> 01:14:39,104
There's no time to waste!

945
01:14:39,271 --> 01:14:42,816
No! She was just going
to go look for the kid.

946
01:14:42,983 --> 01:14:45,444
She's desperate.
That only means one thing!

947
01:14:47,154 --> 01:14:48,614
But where do I look?!

948
01:15:04,796 --> 01:15:05,797
Hana!

949
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:07,299
Miyuki!

950
01:15:09,009 --> 01:15:10,302
Kiyoko!

951
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,144
God must be busy
at this time of year.

952
01:15:19,353 --> 01:15:21,647
Better once a year than never.

953
01:15:22,564 --> 01:15:23,273
Geezer?

954
01:15:32,866 --> 01:15:36,829
You're too late. You just missed
a very moving finale.

955
01:15:37,037 --> 01:15:38,956
What's the matter?

956
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:43,710
"Kiyoko"!

957
01:15:47,214 --> 01:15:48,090
"Stomach"?

958
01:15:50,425 --> 01:15:51,510
"Mother"!

959
01:15:51,718 --> 01:15:53,220
Now that's settled. . .

960
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:55,097
...what the hell do you mean?!

961
01:15:55,556 --> 01:15:59,434
Fake! The mother!
Sachiko's a fake!

962
01:16:01,645 --> 01:16:02,688
Pardon?

963
01:16:08,318 --> 01:16:10,863
Why won't you drink?

964
01:16:11,613 --> 01:16:16,076
A baby has to drink
from its mother's breast.

965
01:16:16,702 --> 01:16:20,789
We'll never be close
if you don't!

966
01:16:27,254 --> 01:16:28,922
Sorry. Wrong people.

967
01:16:31,466 --> 01:16:33,427
She can't be far!

968
01:16:33,886 --> 01:16:35,804
But where do we look?

969
01:16:35,971 --> 01:16:38,599
We can't just give her up now!

970
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:53,071
That's Kiyoko!

971
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,872
Should you be running?

972
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:04,625
If I don't run now, when will I?

973
01:17:05,042 --> 01:17:05,918
This way!

974
01:17:20,224 --> 01:17:24,144
Returning stolen goods to a thief!
How could we be so dumb?!

975
01:17:24,311 --> 01:17:26,063
Who said "family suicide"?

976
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:27,689
You did!

977
01:17:33,821 --> 01:17:34,780
-Which way?
-Left.

978
01:17:34,988 --> 01:17:36,990
-Okay, right!
-Why?

979
01:17:37,491 --> 01:17:38,742
You're a lousy gambler!

980
01:17:38,909 --> 01:17:40,994
You got that right.

981
01:17:41,161 --> 01:17:43,038
Somebody help!

982
01:17:56,677 --> 01:17:57,928
Hey!

983
01:17:58,428 --> 01:17:59,304
Wait!

984
01:17:59,513 --> 01:18:01,140
Thief! Thief!

985
01:18:01,348 --> 01:18:01,974
What's wrong?

986
01:18:02,182 --> 01:18:05,727
A woman just stole my truck!

987
01:18:06,436 --> 01:18:07,688
Hey! Thief!

988
01:18:07,855 --> 01:18:09,982
Yes! That woman!

989
01:18:10,482 --> 01:18:13,277
She's a baby thief!

990
01:18:27,749 --> 01:18:31,086
Be quiet, will you?
Please! Be a good baby!

991
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:41,722
Stop! Give Kiyoko back!

992
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:47,978
Give me a break!

993
01:18:48,145 --> 01:18:50,189
I'm forever in your debt!

994
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:56,403
Gin!

995
01:18:58,113 --> 01:19:00,240
That woman's crazy!

996
01:19:00,782 --> 01:19:01,617
Get closer!

997
01:19:01,783 --> 01:19:02,576
I can't!

998
01:19:02,743 --> 01:19:05,037
You have to, for Kiyoko!

999
01:19:05,245 --> 01:19:07,039
-Who's Kiyoko?!
-Step on it like a man!

1000
01:19:07,247 --> 01:19:08,373
Okay!

1001
01:19:13,253 --> 01:19:15,839
Please! Be quiet!

1002
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,094
-Gin!
-Geezer?!

1003
01:19:24,723 --> 01:19:25,390
Geezer!

1004
01:19:25,599 --> 01:19:29,061
Go for it, Gin!
No action star can touch you!

1005
01:19:29,353 --> 01:19:30,813
Pass her!

1006
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:31,772
We'll die!

1007
01:19:31,939 --> 01:19:32,689
Step on it!

1008
01:19:32,856 --> 01:19:34,525
Okay!

1009
01:19:36,276 --> 01:19:37,945
Stop crying!

1010
01:19:38,821 --> 01:19:41,907
Don't be afraid.
I'll never leave you again.

1011
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:43,492
You want to die?!

1012
01:19:52,709 --> 01:19:54,628
Gin!

1013
01:20:06,682 --> 01:20:08,016
Gin!

1014
01:20:10,561 --> 01:20:11,603
There!

1015
01:20:13,313 --> 01:20:14,898
-Are you okay?!
-Where's Kiyoko?

1016
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:16,650
-Faster!
-Okay!

1017
01:20:36,336 --> 01:20:36,837
Which way?

1018
01:21:24,176 --> 01:21:25,844
We're at the scene...

1019
01:21:26,053 --> 01:21:30,516
...where a truck has crashed
into a building in Shinagawa.

1020
01:21:30,724 --> 01:21:34,978
Now a woman holding a baby
has appeared on the roof.

1021
01:21:35,479 --> 01:21:40,192
Witnesses say the woman
is connected with the incident...

1022
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,653
...as she was driving the truck.

1023
01:21:48,909 --> 01:21:51,703
Now there's someone else
on the roof!

1024
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:57,292
Stay away!

1025
01:21:57,459 --> 01:21:59,628
No!

1026
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:08,929
Tell me why you took
that baby.

1027
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:09,805
I didn't!

1028
01:22:10,097 --> 01:22:12,516
This baby is mine!

1029
01:22:12,683 --> 01:22:16,228
You're lying! Its real parents
are worried sick about it!

1030
01:22:16,436 --> 01:22:17,563
That's not true!

1031
01:22:17,771 --> 01:22:21,692
You of all people should know
what it's like to lose a child!

1032
01:22:33,203 --> 01:22:38,458
She's dead. My baby died
before she was even born!

1033
01:22:45,883 --> 01:22:49,636
All the other babies
looked so healthy there in the ward.

1034
01:22:49,803 --> 01:22:52,306
I wanted to die.

1035
01:22:52,473 --> 01:22:55,058
But then this baby
smiled at me.

1036
01:22:55,225 --> 01:22:57,269
I decided she was mine.

1037
01:22:57,478 --> 01:23:01,565
I thought as long as I had her,
everything would be fine.

1038
01:23:01,732 --> 01:23:05,402
My husband would mend his ways,
and we'd be a real family.

1039
01:23:05,569 --> 01:23:07,362
That's bullshit!

1040
01:23:07,738 --> 01:23:12,993
Build a family by ruining a baby's life?
If you're going to die, do it alone!

1041
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:17,998
A life is a life. It's only born once.
You, me, or Kiyoko.

1042
01:23:23,545 --> 01:23:25,589
Give her back, okay?

1043
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:34,848
I want to be reborn.

1044
01:23:35,849 --> 01:23:37,935
Sachiko!

1045
01:23:39,186 --> 01:23:42,189
Sachiko, don't die!
Come back to me!

1046
01:23:42,356 --> 01:23:46,193
I was wrong!
Please, don't kill yourself!

1047
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:49,196
We'll start again!
We'll be reborn!

1048
01:23:49,530 --> 01:23:51,156
Sachiko!

1049
01:23:51,365 --> 01:23:54,159
I'll go first and wait for you.

1050
01:23:58,539 --> 01:23:59,665
Sachiko!

1051
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:03,377
Please! Let me die!

1052
01:24:03,544 --> 01:24:06,630
Kiyoko wants to see
her mom and dad!

1053
01:24:12,594 --> 01:24:14,054
I want to go home.

1054
01:24:17,349 --> 01:24:19,685
I'm sorry!

1055
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:28,277
Take her...

1056
01:24:28,902 --> 01:24:31,530
...to her mother and father.

1057
01:24:40,998 --> 01:24:41,748
Oh, no.

1058
01:24:42,749 --> 01:24:44,084
Hana!

1059
01:24:45,752 --> 01:24:46,920
I'm okay!

1060
01:24:47,504 --> 01:24:48,922
I'm still alive!

1061
01:25:29,546 --> 01:25:33,550
Inspector, I don't know
how to thank you.

1062
01:25:33,717 --> 01:25:37,387
We're not the ones
you should thank.

1063
01:25:39,556 --> 01:25:44,561
Man, that was a good sleep!
Get me a cigarette, Miyuki.

1064
01:25:44,728 --> 01:25:46,980
-In my jacket.
-Yeah, yeah.

1065
01:25:47,147 --> 01:25:50,400
That was some New Year's!

1066
01:25:51,235 --> 01:25:52,986
It's "No Smoking" here.

1067
01:25:53,195 --> 01:25:56,281
Lighten up! I'm a hero!

1068
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:58,617
You mean "we"!

1069
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:07,376
I guess we won't have to listen to
Kiyoko's damn crying anymore.

1070
01:26:07,543 --> 01:26:09,753
She's not "Kiyoko" anymore.

1071
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,256
I'm not pleased.

1072
01:26:13,173 --> 01:26:14,967
What can we do?

1073
01:26:15,175 --> 01:26:16,802
Not that.

1074
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:19,513
This is a men's ward!

1075
01:26:22,349 --> 01:26:23,934
Perhaps we're intruding.

1076
01:26:24,101 --> 01:26:26,311
No, it's just...

1077
01:26:26,854 --> 01:26:29,273
...I'm told they're homeless.

1078
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:30,649
Who cares?

1079
01:26:30,858 --> 01:26:33,735
We'd like them to be
her godfathers.

1080
01:26:35,529 --> 01:26:36,530
Come in.

1081
01:26:37,739 --> 01:26:38,740
Excuse us.

1082
01:26:39,533 --> 01:26:42,953
The baby's parents
would like to thank you--

1083
01:26:48,625 --> 01:26:50,002
Dad....
