1
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,193
<i>Dear Mr. Stevens:</i>

2
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,557
<i>You will be surprised to hear</i>
<i>from me after all this time.</i>

3
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,673
<i>You've been in my thoughts since</i>
<i>I heard Lord Darlington had died.</i>

4
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,390
<i>We read that his heirs</i>
<i>put Darlington Hall up for sale...</i>

5
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,949
<i>... as they no longer wished</i>
<i>to maintain it.</i>

6
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,789
<i>As no one would buy</i>
<i>such a large house...</i>

7
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,955
<i>... the new earl decided to demolish</i>
<i>it and sell the stone for 5000 pounds.</i>

8
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,195
<i>We also saw some rubbish in the</i>
Daily Mail <i>which made my blood boil:</i>

9
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,112
<i>"Traitor's nest to be pulled down."</i>

10
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,551
One hundred and eighty guineas?

11
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,910
One hundred and eighty?
Have we done?

12
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,552
Ladies and gentlemen,
a great highlight of the sale:

13
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,151
Lot 414...

14
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,552
...the fine Elizabethan portrait,
<i>A Portly Gentleman.</i>

15
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,030
I'll start the bidding
at 2000 guineas.

16
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,158
2000 guineas, thank you.

17
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,349
2200.

18
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,788
2400.

19
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,393
2600.

20
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,959
2800.

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,758
3000. 3200.

22
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,837
3400. 3600.

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,395
3800.

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,394
4000 guineas.
Four and a half thousand.

25
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,595
5000.

26
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,348
And a half.

27
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,879
6000.

28
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,235
And a half.

29
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,475
7000.

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,795
And a half.

31
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,553
8000.

32
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,875
And a half.

33
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,955
9000.

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,354
And a half.

35
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,272
10,000 guineas is bid.

36
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,755
And a half.

37
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,749
11,000.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,989
And a half.

39
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,399
Against you, sir,
at eleven and a half thousand guineas.

40
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,993
All done at
eleven and a half thousand guineas.

41
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,789
<i>I was very relieved to read</i>
<i>how an American millionaire...</i>

42
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,951
<i>... named Lewis saved</i>
<i>Darlington Hall...</i>

43
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,993
<i>... so you wouldn't be turned out</i>
<i>of your home after all.</i>

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,356
<i>Is it the same Congressman Lewis...</i>

45
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,348
<i>... who attended His Lordship's</i>
<i>conference in 1936?</i>

46
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,793
<i>Mr. Stevens, I so often think</i>
<i>of the good old days...</i>

47
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,554
<i>... when I was the housekeeper.</i>

48
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,670
<i>It was hard work...</i>

49
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,311
<i>... and I have known butlers easier</i>
<i>to please than our Mr. Stevens...</i>

50
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,429
<i>... but those years with you were</i>
<i>among the happiest of my life.</i>

51
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,200
<i>You must have a completely</i>
<i>different staff now.</i>

52
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,590
<i>Not many of the old faces</i>
<i>around anymore.</i>

53
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,389
<i>There's not much need</i>
<i>for the small army of footmen...</i>

54
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,108
<i>... that Lord Darlington employed.</i>

55
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,554
<i>My own news is not very cheerful.</i>

56
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,588
<i>In the 7 years since I last wrote,</i>
<i>I have again left my husband...</i>

57
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,150
<i>... and, sad to say,</i>
<i>my marriage seems to be over.</i>

58
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,153
<i>I'm staying at a friend's</i>
<i>boarding house in Clevedon.</i>

59
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,875
<i>I don't know what my future is.</i>

60
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,716
<i>Since Catherine, my daughter, got</i>
<i>married, my life has been empty.</i>

61
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,754
<i>The years stretch before me and</i>
<i>if only I knew how to fill them.</i>

62
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,794
<i>But I would like to be useful again.</i>

63
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,118
- Burned again?
- Yes, I'm sorry, sir.

64
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,400
The rule in the kitchen
has always been...

65
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,350
...cook cooks the cooked breakfast
while her assistant toasts the toast.

66
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,994
Why don't we get her a pop-up toaster?

67
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,153
We need not a new gadget
but a revised staff plan, sir.

68
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,598
A staff plan, huh?
I didn't know we had one.

69
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,559
A faulty one, unfortunately.

70
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,839
Sir, quite recently...

71
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,992
...you were kind enough to suggest
that I go on a little holiday trip...

72
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,117
...around the country.

73
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,034
Absolutely. Certainly, take a break.
See the world.

74
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,229
Thank you, sir.

75
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,515
When did you last see the world?

76
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,799
The world always used to come
to this house, if I may say so.

77
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,394
You may say so.

78
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,189
Take off when I'm in London next week.

79
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,957
I tell you what, you take the car.

80
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,799
- Take the Daimler.
- Good Lord, sir, I couldn't.

81
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,395
You and that Daimler belong together.

82
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,232
You were made for each other.

83
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,671
That's most kind of you,
I must say, sir. Most kind.

84
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,991
I'd meant to travel the West, where I
understand we have splendid scenery.

85
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,597
And I might incidentally be able
to solve our problems while I'm there.

86
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,555
A former housekeeper, at present
living in Clevedon, has indicated...

87
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,354
...that she might be prepared
to return to service.

88
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,357
What's this, your girlfriend?

89
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,953
Or a former attachment?

90
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,993
Oh, no, sir.

91
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,593
No, but a very able housekeeper.

92
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,871
A most able housekeeper.

93
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,751
I was just kidding, Stevens.

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,830
Sorry.

95
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,759
You know what I like best
about your papers?

96
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,634
These obituaries.

97
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,953
Every son of a gun gets
this stately funeral oration.

98
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,197
- It's not an art we have in the States.
- Indeed, sir.

99
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,153
Thank you, Stevens.

100
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,755
Mr. Lewis.

101
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,639
<i>Dear Mrs. Benn...</i>

102
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,272
<i>... I propose to reach Clevedon</i>
<i>on October 3rd around 4 p.m.</i>

103
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,397
<i>I'd be grateful for a line from you...</i>

104
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,792
<i>... to reach me at the post office</i>
<i>at Collingbourne, near Hungerford...</i>

105
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,951
<i>... where I'm planning to stop.</i>

106
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,039
<i>Mrs. Benn, I always said you</i>
<i>possess an amazing memory.</i>

107
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,152
<i>Our new employer is indeed</i>
<i>Congressman Lewis...</i>

108
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,318
<i>... though he's now retired</i>
<i>from political life in the U.S.</i>

109
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,391
<i>He's taken up residence at Darlington</i>
<i>Hall, soon to be joined by his family.</i>

110
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,270
<i>But I regret to say we are woefully</i>
<i>understaffed for a house this size.</i>

111
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,599
<i>Mrs. Benn, will you permit me</i>
<i>once again to sing your praises?</i>

112
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,354
<i>Let me state that when you left</i>
<i>to get married...</i>

113
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,515
<i>... no housekeeper ever reached</i>
<i>your high standard in any department.</i>

114
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,358
<i>I well remember your arrival</i>
<i>at Darlington Hall.</i>

115
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,394
<i>You came somewhat unexpectedly,</i>
<i>one might even say impulsively...</i>

116
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,757
<i>... while we were dead in the middle</i>
<i>of the Charlgrove meet.</i>

117
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,952
<i>That day is marked in my</i>
<i>memory in another way as well.</i>

118
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,997
<i>It was the last time His Lordship...</i>

119
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,357
<i>... was happy to welcome</i>
<i>his neighbours, as in the old days.</i>

120
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,354
<i>Of course, it had been years since</i>
<i>any of them had coaxed him to hunt.</i>

121
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,030
<i>It was never a sport His Lordship</i>
<i>enjoyed or approved of.</i>

122
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,800
- Good morning, Ayres.
- My lord, nice to see you.

123
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,239
Excuse me, sir.

124
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,756
<i>I fear I may have been a little</i>
<i>unwelcoming, even a little short.</i>

125
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,798
<i>You presented the best references</i>
<i>I've ever seen.</i>

126
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,190
<i>Which proved to be well-deserved.</i>

127
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,149
<i>Though, I confess, I did have my</i>
<i>doubts, on account of your youth.</i>

128
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,790
No gentleman callers allowed,
of course.

129
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,596
Forgive my mentioning it, but we've
had those problems before.

130
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,478
Inside the house too.

131
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,474
The previous housekeeper ran off
with the under-butler.

132
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,436
If two staff members decide to get
married, one can say nothing.

133
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,750
What I find a major irritation...

134
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,829
...are those persons who go from
post to post looking for romance.

135
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,514
Housekeepers are particularly
guilty here.

136
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,189
- No offense intended, of course.
- None taken.

137
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,709
I know how a house is at sixes and
sevens once the staff start marrying.

138
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,234
Yes, indeed.

139
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,270
- Might I have a word, sir?
- Of course.

140
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,359
My lord, it's regarding
the under-butler...

141
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,716
...and the housekeeper
who ran off last month.

142
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,111
Bad business.
How are you managing?

143
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,755
I've found two
first-rate replacements.

144
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,679
Miss Kenton, a young woman
with excellent references.

145
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,593
Very pleasing demeanour.
Appears to be very able.

146
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,990
And a man with
considerable experience.

147
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,957
- Older and happy to be under-butler.
- Name?

148
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,996
Stevens, sir.

149
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,992
- Stevens?
- Yes, sir.

150
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,674
- That's your name.
- He's my father, sir.

151
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,554
Really?

152
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,754
Couldn't do better.
I'd like to see him sometime.

153
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,075
He's outside the door.

154
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,032
Good. Bring him in.

155
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,633
Thank you, my lord.

156
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,436
Father.

157
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,151
Mr. Stevens, how do you do?

158
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,828
- My lord.
- Very good man here, your son.

159
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,868
He serves the house well.
I don't know what we'd do without him.

160
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,270
- Proud of him?
- Very, my lord.

161
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,959
Quite right too.

162
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,999
Glad to have you with us.

163
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,355
Thank you, my lord.

164
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,633
What are we at dinner tonight?
14? 16?

165
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,909
Twelve, sir.

166
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,916
Right.

167
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,435
Thank you, my lord.

168
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,152
- This pitcher seems out of place here.
- Dining room. Well spotted.

169
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,151
- Hello, William, how are you?
- Good day, Miss Kenton.

170
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,993
I thought these might
brighten your parlour.

171
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,389
Beg your pardon?

172
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,675
They might cheer things up for you.

173
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,592
That's very kind of you.

174
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,959
If you like, I could bring in
some more for you.

175
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,474
Thank you...

176
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,550
...but I regard this room
as my private place of work...

177
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,593
...and I prefer to keep distractions
to a minimum.

178
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,559
Would you call flowers
a distraction, then?

179
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,070
I appreciate your kindness.
I prefer to keep things as they are.

180
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,677
But since you are here, there is a
small matter I wanted to mention.

181
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,356
I happened to be walking past
the kitchen yesterday morning...

182
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,160
...and I heard you call
to someone named William.

183
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,557
May I ask who you were
addressing by that name?

184
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,513
I should think I was
addressing your father.

185
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,595
There are no other Williams
in this house.

186
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,670
True.

187
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,310
May I ask you in future to address
my father as Mr. Stevens?

188
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,797
If speaking of him
to a third party, you may call him...

189
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,474
...Mr. Stevens Sr.
To distinguish him from myself.

190
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,349
So I would be most grateful to you,
Miss Kenton.

191
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,990
I don't quite understand
what you're getting at.

192
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,991
I am the housekeeper in this house,
and your father is the under-butler.

193
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,472
I am accustomed to addressing under-
servants by their Christian names.

194
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,788
If you would stop to think for a moment,
you'd realize...

195
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,874
...how inappropriate it is for one such
as yourself to address as William...

196
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,350
...someone such as my father.

197
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,556
It must have been very galling for
your father to be called William...

198
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,756
...by one such as myself.

199
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,190
My father is a person from whom...

200
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,477
...if you'd observe him more,
you may learn things.

201
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,274
I'm grateful for your advice,
but do tell me...

202
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,511
...what things might I learn from him?

203
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,796
I might point out that you're...

204
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,634
...often unsure of what goes where
and which item is which.

205
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,991
I'm sure Mr. Stevens Sr.
Is very good at his job...

206
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,557
...but I can assure you
that I'm very good at mine.

207
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,829
- Of course.
- Thank you.

208
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,957
If you will please excuse me.

209
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,350
Oh, well.

210
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,351
My compliments to cook.

211
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,631
What a lovely piece of crackling.

212
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,115
I'm sure you said something witty.
Share it with the rest of us.

213
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,758
I said the sprouts is done the way
I like them. Crisp-like, not mushy.

214
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,076
Sprouts <i>"</i>are<i>"</i> done, not <i>"</i> is<i>"</i> done.

215
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,675
Isn't that right, George?

216
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,875
Yes, Mr. Stevens.

217
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,749
Forgive the correction,
as I would have done...

218
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,554
...at your age for the sake
of my education.

219
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,038
I'm sure even you have ambitions
to rise in your profession.

220
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,994
Oh, yes. I want to be
a butler, to be called Mister...

221
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,028
...sit in my own pantry by my own fire,
smoking my cigar.

222
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,556
I wonder if you realize what it takes
to be a great butler?

223
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,109
Takes dignity, that's what it takes.

224
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,354
Thank you, Mr. Stevens.
Dignity, that's right. Dignity.

225
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,876
The definition from our quarterly
<i>The Gentlemen's Gentleman</i>:

226
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,475
A great butler must be possessed
of dignity...

227
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,756
In keeping with his position.

228
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,792
There was this English butler
in India.

229
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,111
One day, he goes in the dining room
and what's under the table?

230
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,275
A tiger.

231
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,796
Not turning a hair,
he goes to the drawing room.

232
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,917
<i>"</i> Excuse me, my lord,<i>"</i> and whispering,
so as not to upset the ladies:

233
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,871
<i>"</i> I'm sorry. There appears to
be a tiger in the dining room.

234
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,399
Perhaps His Lordship will permit
use of the twelve-bores?<i>"</i>

235
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,351
They go on drinking their tea.
And then, there's three gunshots.

236
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,152
They don't think nothing of it.
In India, they're used to anything.

237
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,991
When the butler is back
to refresh the teapots...

238
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,630
...he says, cool as a cucumber:

239
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,037
<i>"</i> Dinner will be served
at the usual time, my lord.

240
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,473
And I am pleased to say there will
be no discernible traces left...

241
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,951
...of the recent occurrence
by that time.<i>"</i>

242
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,555
I'll repeat it. <i>"</i>There will be
no discernible traces left...

243
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,435
...of the recent occurrence
by that time.<i>"</i>

244
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,274
- Wonderful, Mr. Stevens.
- Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

245
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,116
Wonderful story. That's the ideal
that we should all aim for. Dignity.

246
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,155
For you, Mr. Stevens.

247
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,716
Thank you.

248
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,434
It's for Mr. Stevens Sr.,
Mr. Stevens.

249
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,837
Thank you, Miss Kenton.

250
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,957
Put Mr. Stevens Sr.'s plate
with cook to keep it warm.

251
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,309
Yes, Miss Kenton.

252
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,950
Thank you.

253
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,952
Not at all, Mr. Stevens.

254
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,396
If you're searching for your dustpan,
it is out on the landing.

255
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,595
My dustpan?

256
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,149
You've left it on the landing.

257
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,279
- I haven't used a dustpan.
- Really? It must be somebody else.

258
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,671
- I don't follow you.
- My mistake, no doubt. One of many.

259
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,269
Morning, sir.

260
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,597
I've invited Giscard Dupont D'lvry
as the French delegate.

261
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,353
He'll never come!

262
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,074
I just had word of his acceptance.

263
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,155
Dupont is fanatically anti-German.
His speech in Geneva in '33...

264
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,999
...made me ashamed to be
an ally of the French.

265
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,832
It's not the English way.

266
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,029
No, it is not.

267
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,558
This is the purpose of our conference,
to discuss these matters informally...

268
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,678
...far from the to-do
of an international conference...

269
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,036
...in the friendly and relaxed...

270
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,150
...atmosphere of one's home.

271
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,079
We may bring round the French
to our point of view.

272
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,197
And that of the Germans.

273
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,672
I'm sorry to interrupt, but how can we
associate with the Germans?

274
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,799
With the Nazi Party! They have torn
up and trampled every treaty...

275
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:48,352
...and are a growing threat to Europe,
not to mention a brutal dictatorship.

276
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,555
My dear boy, when I was in Berlin,
I saw at last a happy German people...

277
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,158
...with jobs, bread, pride in their
country and love of their leader.

278
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,231
And what about the Jews?

279
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,194
Did His Lordship wish to exchange
the Chinaman in the cabinet room...

280
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,158
...with the one outside the door?

281
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,033
- Chinaman?
- Yes.

282
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,438
The Chinaman from the cabinet room is
outside this door. See for yourself.

283
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,598
I'm busy at the moment.

284
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,676
Just pop your head outside this door
and see for yourself.

285
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,754
- I'll look into the matter later.
- You think it's a fantasy?

286
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,714
A fantasy on my part
due to my inexperience?

287
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,356
I'm busy in this room, Miss Kenton.

288
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,754
I shall wait.

289
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,915
Outside.

290
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,996
Look!

291
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,993
- Is that not the wrong Chinaman?
- I am very busy.

292
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,470
Have you nothing better to do
than stand around?

293
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,756
Look at it and tell me the truth.

294
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,992
Keep your voice down.
What would the other servants think...

295
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,390
...of us shouting about a Chinaman?

296
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,358
And I would ask you...

297
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,149
...to turn around
and look at the Chinaman.

298
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,278
It is a small mistake.

299
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,751
Your father is entrusted with more
than he can cope with.

300
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,234
Let me pass.

301
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,193
Your father left the dustpan
on the floor.

302
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,193
He left polish on the cutlery
and confused the Chinaman.

303
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,795
Recognize this before he commits
a major error!

304
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,555
- You can't talk to me like this.
- I'm afraid I must.

305
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,070
I'm giving you serious advice.

306
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,479
Your father should be relieved of a
number of his duties for his own good.

307
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,878
Whatever he once was, he no longer
has the same ability or strength.

308
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,995
I thank you for your advice.

309
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,151
Perhaps now I can go about
my business.

310
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,914
I never meant to keep you
from your business.

311
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,669
Thank you.

312
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,030
It's vital that we've agreed a common
policy before the arrival of...

313
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,355
...your Frenchman. What's his name?
- Giscard Dupont D'lvry.

314
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,870
We also expect the
American delegate...

315
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,953
...Congressman Lewis,
to arrive on the same day.

316
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,958
Who is he, this American?

317
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,116
He's an unknown quantity. A young
congressman from Pennsylvania.

318
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,630
Sits on some sort of powerful
Foreign Affairs Committee.

319
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,190
Heir to one of those
American fortunes.

320
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,396
- Meatpacking?
- Trolley cars?

321
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,232
Or dry goods?

322
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,357
What are dry goods?

323
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,154
Something that Americans make
a lot of money in.

324
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,678
No, I think Mr. Lewis' fortune
comes from cosmetics, actually.

325
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,359
It's old Mr. Stevens!

326
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,990
Get a cushion, quickly.
A blanket!

327
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,590
The silver!
The silver!

328
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,831
Oh, my lord. Sorry.

329
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,833
You'll be all right.

330
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,473
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry.
What happened?

331
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,473
- He tripped with the tray.
- I saw it from the window.

332
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,676
This has never happened before.

333
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,639
- May I telephone the doctor?
- Yes, do.

334
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,117
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

335
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,797
Your father feeling better?

336
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,758
He's made a full recovery.

337
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,393
Good.

338
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,479
We don't wish to see anything
of that sort ever happen again, do we?

339
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,792
- I mean, your father collapsing.
- Indeed not, my lord.

340
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,156
And it could happen anywhere.

341
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,239
At any time.

342
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,279
The first of the foreign delegates
will be here in less than a fortnight.

343
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,478
- We are well prepared, my lord.
- I'm sure you are.

344
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,473
What happens within this house
could have...

345
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,792
...considerable repercussions
on the course that Europe takes.

346
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,158
It means a great deal.

347
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,432
And it means a great deal
to me personally.

348
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,992
I had a German friend,
Karl-Heinz Bremann.

349
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,879
We fought on opposite sides
in the war.

350
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,795
We always said when it was over,
we'd sit down and have a drink...

351
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,314
...like gentlemen.

352
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,588
The Versailles Treaty
made a liar of me.

353
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,914
Yes, a liar, Stevens.

354
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,312
Because the terms we imposed were
so harsh that Germany was finished.

355
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,997
One doesn't do that
to a defeated foe.

356
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,391
Once your man's on the canvas,
it ought to be over.

357
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,869
My friend Bremann
was ruined by inflation.

358
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,238
Couldn't get a job
in postwar Germany.

359
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,394
Killed himself.

360
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,235
Shot himself in a railway carriage.

361
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,398
Since then, I've felt it my duty
to help Germany and to give her...

362
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,993
...a fair chance.

363
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,156
So this conference is crucial...

364
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,790
...and we can't run the risk
of any accidents.

365
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,110
There's no question
of your father leaving.

366
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,195
You're simply being asked
to reconsider his duties.

367
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,159
Of course, my lord.
I understand fully.

368
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,429
Good.

369
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,073
I'll leave you to think about it,
then, Stevens.

370
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,309
Thank you, sir.

371
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,277
I'm short-handed in the dining room.
I can use you in the servery.

372
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,876
- Thank you, Mr. Stevens, sir.
- Smarten up. Look sharp.

373
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,716
Good morning.

374
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,235
Good morning.

375
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,358
I might've known you'd be up
and ready for the day.

376
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,670
I've been up for two hours.

377
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,955
- That's not much sleep.
- It's all the sleep I need.

378
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,355
I've come to talk to you.

379
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,637
Talk, then.
I haven't got all morning.

380
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,150
- I'll come straight to the point.
- Do, and be done with it.

381
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,749
Some of us have work
to be getting on with.

382
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,596
There's to be a very important
conference in this house next week.

383
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,236
People of great stature will be
His Lordship's guests.

384
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,949
We must all put our best foot forward.

385
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,193
Because of Father's recent accident...

386
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,069
...it has been suggested that you
no longer wait at table.

387
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,517
I've waited at table every day...

388
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,320
...for the last 54 years.

389
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,995
It has also been decided that you
should no longer carry heavy trays.

390
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,952
Now, here's a revised list
of your duties.

391
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,673
Look, I fell...

392
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,878
...because of those paving stones.

393
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,155
They're crooked.

394
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,750
Why don't you get them put right
before someone else falls?

395
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,395
You will read the revised list
of your duties.

396
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,949
Get those stones put right.

397
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,635
You don't want those <i>"</i>gentlemen of
stature<i>"</i> breaking their necks.

398
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,871
No, indeed, I don't.

399
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,789
What is it?

400
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,238
You have what we can call
a roving commission.

401
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,916
In other words, you can exercise
your own judgment...

402
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,196
...within certain limits, of course.

403
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,995
Now, here are the mops, and...
Here.

404
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,794
- Are these me mops?
- Right. Your brushes.

405
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,473
And me brushes?

406
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,075
- And me mops.
- That's right.

407
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,796
What do you want me to do with them?

408
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,592
I think you know what to do with them,
Father. Look for dust and dirt.

409
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,840
If I find any dust or dirt...

410
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,389
...I go over them with this mop.

411
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,834
That's right.

412
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,799
Now, I suggest you start off...

413
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,190
...with the brasses on the doors.

414
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,113
There's that door there.
Then the door that's open.

415
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,396
And then there's this door here...

416
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,710
Here's your polish.
And duster.

417
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,475
History could well be made under
this roof over the next few days.

418
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,511
Each and every one of you...

419
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,719
...can be proud of the role
you will play on this occasion.

420
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,838
<i>Imagine yourself</i>
<i>the head of a battalion...</i>

421
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,913
<i>... even if it is only filling</i>
<i>the hot-water bottles.</i>

422
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,634
<i>Each one has his own</i>
<i>particular duty...</i>

423
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,713
<i>... or her particular duty,</i>
<i>as the cap fits.</i>

424
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,078
<i>Polished brass, brilliant silver,</i>
<i>mahogany shining like a mirror.</i>

425
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,917
<i>That is the welcome we will show</i>
<i>these foreign visitors...</i>

426
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,230
<i>... to let them know</i>
<i>they are in England...</i>

427
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,075
<i>... where order and tradition</i>
<i>still prevail.</i>

428
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,794
Thank you, Brian.

429
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,190
Mr. Lewis, the American,
has arrived.

430
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,273
He was expected tomorrow.
What have you done with him?

431
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,235
Mr. Lewis has been shown upstairs.

432
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,795
My godson, Cardinal, will shortly
become engaged to be married.

433
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,594
Indeed, sir.
I offer my congratulations.

434
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,239
Thank you, Stevens.

435
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,837
I feel very responsible for the boy.

436
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,312
He is my godson, and his father
was my closest friend, as you know.

437
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,790
And now that he's gone, well...

438
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,834
...I feel in place of a father to him.

439
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,993
I've appointed him as my secretary
at the conference.

440
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,476
He's been jolly thorough
in helping me to prepare.

441
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,791
I realize this is a somewhat
irregular thing to ask you to do.

442
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,430
I'd be glad to be of any assistance.

443
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,398
I'm sorry to bring this up...

444
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,275
...but I just can't see how on earth
to make it go away.

445
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,514
You are familiar with
the facts of life?

446
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,110
- My lord?
- The facts of life.

447
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,999
Birds, bees.
You are familiar, aren't you?

448
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,712
I'm afraid I don't quite follow you.

449
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,394
Let me put my cards on the table.

450
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,036
I'm so busy with this conference.
Of course, you are too...

451
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,074
...but someone has to tell him.

452
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,709
In a way, it would be easier for you.

453
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,959
Less awkward.

454
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,033
I'd find the task rather daunting,
I'm afraid.

455
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,670
I might not get to it
before Reginald's wedding day.

456
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,396
Of course, this goes far beyond
the call of duty.

457
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,229
I shall do my best.

458
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,517
I'd be grateful if you'd try.
It'd be a lot off my mind.

459
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,278
There's no need to make a song and
dance of it. Just convey the facts.

460
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,633
God! Stevens!

461
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,713
Sorry. Most sorry, sir...

462
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,191
...but I do have something to convey
to you rather urgently.

463
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,000
If I may, I'll come to the point.

464
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,990
Perhaps you noticed this morning the
ducks and the geese by the pond?

465
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,231
Ducks and geese?
I don't think so.

466
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,592
Well, perhaps the birds
and the flowers, then...

467
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,035
...or the shrubs, the bees...

468
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,475
I've not seen any bees.

469
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,639
- It's not the best time to see them.
- What, the bees?

470
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,115
What I'm saying is that,
with the arrival of spring...

471
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,194
...we shall see a most remarkable
and profound change...

472
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,714
...in the surroundings.

473
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,033
I'm sure that's right. I'm sure the
grounds are not at their best now.

474
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,238
I wasn't paying attention
to the glories of nature...

475
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,596
...because it's worrying...

476
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:34,719
Dupont D'lvry has arrived in a foul
mood, the last thing anyone wants.

477
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,033
- M. Dupont D'lvry has arrived?
- Half an hour ago, in a foul mood.

478
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,592
In that case, excuse me.
I'd better go and attend to him.

479
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,274
Right you are.
Kind of you to talk to me.

480
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,718
Not at all. I've one or two words
more to convey on the topic of...

481
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,190
...as you put it most admirably...

482
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,628
...the glories of nature.

483
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,235
But it must wait for another occasion.

484
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,392
I'll look forward to it.
But I'm more of a fish man.

485
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,392
- Fish?
- I know all about fish.

486
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,999
Freshwater and salt.

487
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,396
All living creatures would be
relevant to our discussion.

488
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,599
Excuse me. I had no idea that
<i>Monsieur</i> Dupont D'lvry had arrived.

489
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,875
Thank you.

490
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,677
May I be of assistance, sir?

491
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,633
Oh, the butler.

492
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,950
I have sore feet, so I need a basin
with warm water and salts, please.

493
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,993
I'll arrange that with
the housekeeper, sir.

494
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,997
Warm water and salts
as soon as possible.

495
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,996
How do you do? But I speak English.

496
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,432
Good. That's lucky for me.
I'm Jack Lewis, the U.S. Delegate.

497
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,671
Could we speak privately soon?

498
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,995
Yes, of course.

499
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,955
But I have blisters due to some
sightseeing they made me do in London.

500
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,350
I had already seen
the Tower of London.

501
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,031
I've discovered that things
are not moving...

502
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,431
...in a direction that I think
you would approve of.

503
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,237
German rearmament
is a fact to be accepted.

504
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,711
It's in our own interest to have a free
and equal Germany.

505
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,598
Not a prostrate nation...

506
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,395
...upon whom an unfair peace treaty
was imposed 16 years ago.

507
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,397
Those who've been in Germany...

508
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,390
...can only thrill, as I have,
to the signs of rebirth.

509
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,833
- To assist Germany in her virile
struggle for economic recovery...

510
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,437
...including support for her fair
demand for equality of armaments...

511
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,672
...and universal military service
for German youth.

512
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,597
If we, in postwar Europe...

513
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,436
I need more water.
I need another basin to bathe my feet.

514
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,556
Follow me, sir.

515
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,035
Excuse me.

516
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,557
- We have to talk.
- This way, sir.

517
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,829
My friend, I am in agony.
Too tight shoes. I blame myself.

518
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,479
Vanity.

519
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,919
We must do some fast maneuvering
to restrain the Germans.

520
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,071
Please come this way, gentlemen.

521
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,434
Butler, please, could you help me
with my feet... shoe?

522
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,636
- Yes, of course.
- Take it off.

523
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,635
What they said about equality of arms
for Germany, military service...

524
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,757
- Sorry, sir.
- I'll manage.

525
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,756
What?

526
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,594
Your father's been taken ill, sir.

527
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,031
- Where?
- Outside the Chinese bedroom, sir.

528
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,637
Germany wants peace as much as we do.
She needs peace.

529
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,916
Here, let me help you with that.

530
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,595
Thank you.

531
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,679
Thank you, Charles.

532
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,430
Take a basin of hot water and salts...

533
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,036
...to Mr. D'lvry in the
billiards room. Is that understood?

534
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,396
- Yes, Mr. Stevens.
- Good. Do it.

535
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,389
Father?

536
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,428
I have more time than you to look
after him. I've called the doctor.

537
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,999
Thank you, Miss Kenton.

538
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,996
Your father's not so good, I'm afraid.

539
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,438
If he deteriorates, call me, will you?

540
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,193
How old is he? 70, 72?

541
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,192
- 75, sir.
- I see.

542
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,634
- If he deteriorates, let me know.
- I will, sir. Thank you, doctor.

543
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,590
More haste, less speed.

544
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,510
There's something missing.

545
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,236
What is it?

546
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,119
- The spoon from the cruet set, sir.
- Good.

547
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,395
Well observed.

548
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,311
Now, never touch the lip of the glass.

549
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,356
Good.

550
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,158
Glass first, and then...

551
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,309
Is everything in hand downstairs?

552
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,872
We're preparing the last dinner
of the conference.

553
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,591
You can imagine the kitchen.

554
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,072
- But is everything in hand?
- Yes, I think we're up to scratch.

555
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,709
Are you feeling any better?

556
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,910
There's something I have to tell you.

557
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,316
I have so much to do.
Why don't we talk in the morning?

558
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,515
Jim...

559
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,555
...I fell out of love
with your mother.

560
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,232
I loved her once.

561
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,676
The love went out of me
when I found her carrying on.

562
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,478
A good son.

563
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,358
Proud of you.

564
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,390
I hope I've been a good father.

565
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,231
I tried me best.

566
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,675
You better get down there...

567
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,632
...or heaven only knows
what they'll be up to.

568
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,588
Go on.

569
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,349
Go on!

570
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,671
We'll talk in the morning.

571
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,913
On the last day of our conference...

572
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,835
...permit me to say
how impressed I have been...

573
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,995
...with the spirit of goodwill
that has prevailed.

574
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,710
Goodwill for Germany.

575
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,996
And with tears in my eyes...

576
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,078
...I see that everyone here
has recognized...

577
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,717
...our right to be, once again,
a strong nation.

578
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,274
With my hand on my heart,
I declare...

579
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,551
...that Germany needs peace...

580
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,395
...and desires only peace.

581
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,674
Peace with England...

582
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,110
...and peace with France.

583
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,393
Thank you very much.

584
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,797
I, too, have been impressed...

585
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,589
...yes, deeply impressed...

586
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:19,152
...by the genuine desire for peace
manifested at this conference.

587
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,510
Unlike our American colleague...

588
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,752
...we in Europe know
the horrors of war.

589
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:31,149
And whether we are French
or English or Italian or German...

590
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,393
...our one desire is to never
have to experience them again.

591
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,030
Indeed.

592
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,033
Impressed, or I may say touched...

593
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,829
...by the words of goodwill
and friendship I have heard...

594
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,477
...I promise you that I shall do
my utmost...

595
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,915
...to change my country's policy...

596
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,594
...towards that nation
which was once our foe...

597
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,229
...but is now,
I may venture to say...

598
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:56,390
...our friend.

599
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,033
Ladies and gentlemen...

600
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,155
...the United States doesn't want war
any more than you do.

601
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,031
On the other hand, neither do we
want peace at any price...

602
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,840
...because some prices,
you may find...

603
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,640
...are too outrageously high to pay.

604
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,316
But let's not get into that now.
We may have to soon enough.

605
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,189
For the moment, let us raise
our glasses to Lord Darlington...

606
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,238
...in gratitude for his
magnificent hospitality.

607
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,958
Lord Darlington is a classic
English gentleman of the old school.

608
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,309
Decent and honorable and well-meaning.

609
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,394
So are all of you. All decent,
honorable and well-meaning gentlemen.

610
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,076
It's a pleasure and a privilege
to visit with you here.

611
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,556
But...

612
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,236
...now, excuse me, I must say this...

613
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,238
...you are, all of you, amateurs.

614
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:22,478
And international affairs should
never be run by gentlemen amateurs.

615
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,077
Do you have any idea of what sort
of a place the world is becoming?

616
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,110
The days when you could act
out of noble instincts are over.

617
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,638
Europe has become the arena of
<i>Realpolitik,</i> the politics of reality.

618
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,952
If you like, real politics.

619
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,718
What you need is not gentlemen
politicians, but real ones.

620
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,589
You need professionals,
or you're headed for disaster.

621
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,635
So I propose a toast, gentlemen...

622
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,558
...to the professionals.

623
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,590
Well, I've no wish to enter
into a quarrel...

624
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,597
...on our last evening together.

625
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,992
But let me say this.
What you describe as amateurism...

626
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:15,028
...is what I think most of us here
still prefer to call honour.

627
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,469
Miss Kenton would like to see you
concerning your father.

628
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,235
I suggest that your professionalism
means greed and power...

629
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,555
...rather than to see justice
and goodness prevail in the world.

630
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,239
I've never concealed from myself
that what we were asking of Germany...

631
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,837
...is a complete break from the
tradition of this country. Thank you.

632
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,756
Mr. Stevens, I'm very sorry.

633
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,272
Your father passed away
four minutes ago.

634
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,233
Oh, I see.

635
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,878
I'm so very sorry.

636
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,748
I wish there was something
I could say.

637
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,911
Will you come up and see him?

638
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:11,119
Well, I'm very busy at the moment.
In a little while, perhaps.

639
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,430
In that case, will you permit me
to close his eyes?

640
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,433
I would be most grateful.
Thank you.

641
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,631
My father would wish me to carry on.
I can't let him down.

642
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,671
No. Of course.

643
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,392
I'd really like to continue
our little chat sometime.

644
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,199
About nature.

645
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,309
You're right. I should come back
when everything's burgeoning.

646
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,959
Yes, sir. Indeed.

647
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,028
As I said before, my main interest
has always been in fish.

648
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:04,034
When I was small,
I kept tropical fish in a tank.

649
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,430
I harboured quite a passion for them.

650
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,589
I'll have another drop of that,
if you don't mind.

651
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,908
You all right?

652
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,113
I'm perfectly all right.

653
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,918
Not feeling unwell?

654
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,515
No, sir. A little tired, perhaps.

655
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,754
Wonderful!

656
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,238
What a beautiful example of German
culture you've brought to this house.

657
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,155
Very nice.

658
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,711
I hope there's no hard feelings.

659
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,518
Oh, my dear good chap.

660
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,833
I like a good, clean fight.
Giving as good as one gets, what?

661
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,436
I have the greatest respect
for the English. I love it here.

662
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,990
My family brought us here as kids,
so I feel at home.

663
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,389
Anyway, thank you.

664
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:05,949
Excuse me.

665
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,913
You all right?

666
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,359
Yes, perfect, my lord.

667
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,994
You coming down
with a cold or something?

668
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,588
It's been a long day.

669
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,758
It's been a hard day for both of us.

670
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,393
Well done.

671
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,758
My condolences.

672
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:56,035
It was a stroke. A severe stroke.
He wouldn't have suffered much pain.

673
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,038
Thank you for telling me.

674
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,996
There's a distinguished foreign
gentleman in the billiard room...

675
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,389
...in need of attention.

676
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,595
Urgent?

677
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,159
His feet.

678
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,675
Feet?

679
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,512
- I'll take you to him.
- If it's urgent.

680
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,959
It is urgent.
The gentleman is in pain.

681
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,199
My condolences.

682
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,954
Thank you. That is most kind of you.

683
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,069
Good afternoon.

684
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,551
My name is Stevens.
I'm hoping there's a letter for me.

685
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,158
- I'll just check for you, sir.
- James Stevens.

686
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,351
- I'd like two apples, please.
- There you are, Mr. Stevens.

687
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,470
- You are touring in these parts?
- I'm on my way to Clevedon.

688
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,871
- How much is that?
- That'll be threepence, please.

689
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,076
And you'd be coming from...?

690
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,958
- Oxfordshire.
- Whereabouts?

691
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,113
- Sorry?
- Whereabouts in Oxfordshire?

692
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,196
Darlington.

693
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:53,075
That rings a bell. Wasn't there
a Lord Darlington? Some sort...

694
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,117
...of Nazi, got us in the war?

695
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,749
I'm the butler there,
and my employer...

696
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,110
...is Mr. Lewis, an American gentleman.

697
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,431
I didn't know the former owner.

698
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,829
Your change.

699
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,991
<i>I should be glad to meet you at the</i>
<i>Sea View Hotel, opposite the pier.</i>

700
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:36,358
<i>We'll have such a lot to talk about,</i>
<i>and I'll have many questions.</i>

701
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,559
<i>Ex cept for you, I've lost touch with</i>
<i>all our friends at Darlington Hall.</i>

702
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,795
<i>But that's no wonder.</i>

703
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:45,555
<i>It was long ago and a lot</i>
<i>has happened in between.</i>

704
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:49,999
<i>Who could keep track of all the people</i>
<i>His Lordship once employed?</i>

705
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,559
My lord, you rang?

706
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,196
- Have the young German ladies arrived?
- They're outside.

707
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,273
I'd like to say hello to them,
practise my German.

708
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:02,593
- They do speak excellent English.
- Good. Well, ask them to come in.

709
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,470
This is Elsa and this is Irma.

710
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,912
I'm asking about their journey.

711
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,398
It was long, my lord.

712
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,358
I asked if they like the weather.

713
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:36,439
We are grateful to you, my lord,
for letting us come here.

714
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,156
Our parents are very grateful.

715
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,272
Not at all.
Miss Kenton will look after you.

716
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,192
- Won't you?
- Indeed, my lord.

717
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,589
Welcome to Darlington Hall.

718
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,229
- Thank you, my lord.
- Thank you, my lord.

719
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,032
Will there be anything else?

720
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,795
Sir Geoffrey.

721
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,674
Good to see you.

722
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,668
How do you do?

723
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,554
Well, come in.

724
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,392
- Mr. Benn.
- Mr. Stevens.

725
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,313
Gentlemen, if you'd like to wait
here for a while.

726
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:45,553
- Aren't you still at Stanton Lacey?
- I'm with Sir Geoffrey now.

727
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,194
- You haven't changed one bit.
- I'll let you get on.

728
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,954
- Perhaps we'll meet later.
- I hope so.

729
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,676
But, gentlemen, you speak of Jews
and Gypsies, Negroes and so forth.

730
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,869
But one has to regard the racial
laws of the Fascists...

731
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:06,476
...as a sanitary measure,
much overdue, in my opinion.

732
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,757
Imagine trying to enforce
such a rule in this country...

733
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,077
You cannot run a country
without a penal system.

734
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:17,757
Here we call them prisons. There,
they call them concentration camps.

735
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,349
Is there any meat
of any kind in this soup?

736
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,591
I think it's mushroom stock, sir.

737
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:27,594
Mushroom ends and skins,
onion and celery. No meat at all.

738
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:30,593
Cold water, and then cook adds sherry.

739
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,669
I hear you have a Labour fellow
from your constituency.

740
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:38,799
Over there, they've got rid of
all that trade union rubbish.

741
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,589
Believe me, no workers strike
in Germany.

742
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,876
And everyone's kept in line.

743
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,998
No wonder this country
is going down the drain.

744
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,356
It is internally diseased.

745
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,672
I think there may be butter
in the croutons. Do you know?

746
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,990
I'm afraid there may be.

747
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,795
You've made a cozy little nest here.

748
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,634
Seems to me you must be
a well-contented man.

749
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,396
In my philosophy, Mr. Benn...

750
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,154
...a man cannot call himself
well-contented...

751
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:21,391
...until he has done all he can...

752
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,790
...to be of service to his employer.

753
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,156
This assumes that one's employer...

754
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,393
...is a superior person
not only in rank or wealth...

755
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,153
...but in moral stature.

756
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,949
And in your opinion, what's going on
up there has <i>"</i>moral stature<i>"</i>?

757
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,031
I wish I could be sure.

758
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,789
But I'm not.

759
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,952
I've heard some very fishy things.
Very fishy.

760
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,276
I hear nothing.

761
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,316
Listen.

762
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,596
That's so touching, isn't it?

763
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:00,115
To listen to the gentlemen
would distract me from my work.

764
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,433
It's fresh soda.

765
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,153
Would you be joining us?

766
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,154
Thank you, but it's very late
and I have an early start.

767
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,588
Good night.

768
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,832
- Good night, Mr. Stevens.
- Good night, Miss Kenton.

769
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,753
Good-looking woman.

770
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:38,072
It was never the same
after she left Stanton Lacey.

771
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,959
I handed in my own notice
six months later.

772
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,951
I'd be lost without her.

773
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:51,077
A first-rate housekeeper
is essential in a house like this...

774
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:54,949
...where great affairs are decided
between these walls.

775
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,471
- Good morning.
- My lord.

776
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:22,952
<i>"We do the Jews no injustice when we</i>
<i>say that the revelation of Christ...</i>

777
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,755
<i>... is something incomprehensible</i>
<i>and hateful to them.</i>

778
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,394
<i>Though He apparently sprang</i>
<i>from their midst...</i>

779
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:33,076
<i>... He embodies the negation of their</i>
<i>whole nature.</i>

780
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,790
<i>The Jews are far more sensitive</i>
<i>about this than we are.</i>

781
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:41,795
<i>This demonstration of the cleft that</i>
<i>separates us Europeans from the Jew...</i>

782
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,998
<i>... is not given in order</i>
<i>to let religious prejudice...</i>

783
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,754
<i>... with its dangerous bias,</i>
<i>settle the matter...</i>

784
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,549
<i>... but because the perception of</i>
<i>two fundamentally different natures...</i>

785
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,836
<i>... reveals a real gulf. "</i>

786
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:15,591
We have some refugee girls
on the staff now, I believe.

787
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,989
We do.

788
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,549
Two housemaids, Elsa and Irma.

789
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,550
You'll have to let them go,
I'm afraid.

790
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,153
Let them go, my lord?

791
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:31,552
It's regrettable,
but we have no choice.

792
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,395
You must see the whole thing
in context.

793
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,712
I have the well-being
of my guests to consider.

794
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,593
May I say...

795
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,671
...they work extremely well.

796
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,673
They're intelligent, polite
and very clean.

797
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,674
I'm sorry, but I've looked
into this matter very carefully.

798
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,229
There are larger issues at stake.

799
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,591
I'm sorry, but there it is.

800
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:01,710
They're Jews.

801
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:06,995
Yes, my lord.

802
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,395
I'm amazed you can stand
there as if...

803
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,349
...you were discussing orders
for the larder. I can't believe it!

804
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:21,472
Elsa and Irma are to be dismissed
because they're Jewish?

805
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:26,191
His Lordship has decided. There's
nothing for you and I to discuss.

806
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,557
Without work, they could be
sent back to Germany.

807
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,028
It is out of our hands.

808
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,955
I tell you, if you dismiss my girls
tomorrow, it will be wrong!

809
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,509
A sin, as any sin ever was one!

810
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:50,274
There are many things you and I
don't understand in this world.

811
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:54,559
His Lordship understands fully and has
studied the larger issues at stake...

812
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,671
...concerning, say...

813
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,317
...the nature of Jewry.

814
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:06,912
I warn you...

815
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:09,152
...if those girls go...

816
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,237
...I shall leave this house.

817
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,235
Please.

818
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,634
These references,
I have to tell you...

819
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,353
...are quite reserved.

820
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,080
Why did you leave
your last employment?

821
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:47,755
- They didn't want me anymore.
- Why not?

822
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,558
I don't know.

823
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,951
They just didn't want me anymore.

824
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,718
They say she works well.

825
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,478
Would you please wait outside?

826
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,795
- She's unsuitable.
- Not at all. I want her.

827
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,759
- She'll be under my supervision.
- She's not suitable.

828
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,195
She'll do well. I'll see to it.

829
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:17,839
Well, then, it is entirely
your responsibility.

830
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:22,154
Weren't you leaving
because of the German girls?

831
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,155
I'm not leaving.

832
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:29,559
I've nowhere to go. I have no family.

833
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,156
I'm a coward.

834
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,317
Yes. I am a coward.

835
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,674
I'm frightened of leaving,
and that's the truth.

836
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:43,358
All I see out in the world
is loneliness, and it frightens me.

837
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,712
That's all my high principles
are worth.

838
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,912
I'm ashamed of myself.

839
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:03,274
You mean a great deal to this house.

840
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:12,518
You're extremely important
to this house.

841
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,549
Am I?

842
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:25,753
Now, look here...

843
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:30,351
...if you're really sure about
this young woman, call her back in.

844
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,598
Miss Hull, we would like you
to start next week.

845
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:52,595
You're responsible to Miss Kenton.
She'll explain the house rules.

846
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:56,276
Number one: No gentlemen callers,
or other such.

847
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:58,192
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

848
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,715
- Welcome.
- Thank you, sir.

849
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,150
Well done.
I'll show you to your room.

850
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,359
I'd forgotten how much petrol
the Daimler uses.

851
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:03,951
It's an impractical motor to be
going about the country, Mister...

852
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,795
Smith. Harry Smith. It's a privilege
to have you here in Moscombe.

853
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,600
- It's a privilege to be here.
- Your health, sir.

854
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,958
Dr. Carlisle usually drops in
around now. He'd enjoy meeting you.

855
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,355
He's a gentleman like yourself.

856
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,835
I don't know what you call
a gentleman.

857
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,117
It's a name every man
in this country has a right to.

858
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,989
There's Harry Smith now, giving
you an earful of his philosophy.

859
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,468
We English...

860
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:32,269
...have the advantage and privilege
of expressing our opinions...

861
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,399
...and voting for Parliament.
That's what we fought Hitler for.

862
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,313
Have you had much to do
with politics yourself?

863
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:44,633
Not directly as such, no,
particularly in these days.

864
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:49,199
Perhaps more so in the early 1930s
and just before the war.

865
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,472
My concern was more
international affairs.

866
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,280
Or foreign policy, so to speak.

867
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,079
Not that I ever held high office,
mind you.

868
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,039
No, any influence I exerted
was in an unofficial capacity.

869
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,793
Excuse me, sir.

870
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,071
Have you ever met Mr. Churchill?

871
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:15,672
He came to the house occasionally.
Again, in the early 1930s.

872
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,478
He was a bloody warmonger!

873
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:21,999
Honestly, Harry! We wouldn't have won
the war without him.

874
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:25,630
Not content to fight Germans,
he sent troops in against the miners.

875
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,394
- What about the war?
- Yes, all right.

876
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,393
He did well in the war,
but he should've stepped down.

877
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:34,677
- And Mr. Eden?
- He made a right bugger of Suez!

878
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,559
Yes, I met Mr. Eden.
Yes, occasionally.

879
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:39,791
How do you do? Richard Carlisle.

880
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:42,952
Rotten luck about your car,
but nice to have you.

881
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:47,113
- Everyone has been most kind.
- He says he knows foreign affairs.

882
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,152
Is that so, indeed?

883
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,192
In an unofficial capacity.

884
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,717
- He knows Mr. Churchill.
- And Mr. Eden.

885
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,475
Really?

886
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:01,952
Yes, well, it was my good fortune
to have consorted...

887
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:06,119
...with many men of influence
from Europe and from America.

888
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,949
Mr. Taylor...

889
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:16,352
...I really feel I ought to retire now
because I'm feeling rather tired.

890
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,551
No wonder, sir.
Running out of petrol...

891
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,758
...then having to hear Smith's
political opinions.

892
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:23,799
Just step this way, sir.

893
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:27,794
I'm going to Stanbury in the
morning. I'll give you a lift...

894
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,759
...and we could pick up
a can of petrol on the way.

895
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,869
- I'd hate to inconvenience you.
- Not at all. Would 7:30 suit you?

896
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,999
You'll enjoy talking to Dr. Carlisle.
Watch this step.

897
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,549
Excuse Harry Smith.

898
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,997
He will go on about his politics.
I don't mean he's not right.

899
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:49,358
Democracy is why we fought Hitler, and
we lost a few lads in this village...

900
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,079
...including our son here.

901
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,439
Dunkirk.

902
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,473
I'll get you a blanket.

903
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,474
I've left a razor and soap
on the basin.

904
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,355
Listen to the opinions
of your man in the street.

905
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,194
They're perfectly entitled
to give an opinion...

906
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,954
...on politics or whatever questions...

907
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,151
They've got no qualifications!

908
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,191
Of course they have!

909
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,033
Mr. Spencer would like
a word with you.

910
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:55,479
My good man,
I have a question for you.

911
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:00,476
Do you suppose the debt situation
regarding America...

912
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:03,996
...factors significantly in the
present low levels of trade?

913
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,958
Or is this a red herring...

914
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:10,551
...and the abandonment of the gold
standard is the cause of the problem?

915
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:16,552
I'm sorry, sir, but I am unable
to be of assistance in this matter.

916
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,154
Oh, dear.
What a pity.

917
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,436
Perhaps you'd help us
on another matter.

918
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,872
Do you think...

919
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:28,159
...Europe's currency problem would be
alleviated by an arms agreement...

920
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,716
...between the French
and the Bolsheviks?

921
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:37,031
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm unable
to be of assistance in this matter.

922
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,038
Very well, that'll be all.

923
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:44,956
One moment, Darlington, I have another
question to put to our good man here.

924
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,673
My good fellow...

925
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,754
...do you share our opinion...

926
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,956
...that M. Daladier's recent speech
on North Africa...

927
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,553
...was simply a ruse...

928
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:00,271
...to scupper the nationalist fringe
of his own domestic party?

929
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:04,799
I'm sorry, sir. I am unable
to help in any of these matters.

930
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:09,352
You see, our good man here is <i>"</i> unable
to assist us in these matters.<i>"</i>

931
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,353
Yet we still go along
with the notion...

932
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,956
...that this nation's decisions
be left to our good man here...

933
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,952
...and a few millions like him.

934
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,872
You may as well ask the Mothers'
Union to organize a war campaign.

935
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,319
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

936
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,436
You certainly proved your point.

937
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:36,075
- Q.E.D., I think.
- No, not at all!

938
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,878
Oh, yes, he has!

939
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:46,749
What did you make of the citizens
of Moscombe? Not a bad bunch.

940
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:47,790
No, sir.

941
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:51,112
Mr. And Mrs. Taylor
were extremely kind.

942
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:57,191
I say, I hope you don't
think me very rude...

943
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,238
...but you aren't a manservant
of some sort, are you?

944
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,472
Yes, sir. I am, indeed.

945
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,673
In fact, I'm the butler
of Darlington Hall, near Oxford.

946
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,668
It wasn't my intention
to deceive anyone.

947
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,388
Don't explain.
I can see how it happened.

948
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,719
Darlington.

949
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,595
Wasn't there a
Lord Darlington involved...

950
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,752
...in that appeasement business
that got us into the war?

951
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,954
Sorry, I never knew
that Lord Darlington.

952
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:30,550
My employer's an American
gentleman, Mr. Lewis.

953
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:37,470
Lord Darlington was among those who
tried to make a deal with Hitler.

954
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,399
Then there was a case after the war...

955
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,631
...where he sued a newspaper
for libel.

956
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,838
<i>The Express,</i> was it?
<i>News Chronicle</i>?

957
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,674
- I couldn't say, sir.
- Anyway, he lost.

958
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,997
He was lucky, really, not to have
been tried for treason.

959
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,594
There it is, just ahead.

960
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:12,832
Sir, I must confess...

961
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:15,548
...that I failed to tell
you the truth.

962
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:21,676
I did know Lord Darlington, and I can
declare that he was a truly good man.

963
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,757
A gentleman through and through...

964
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:27,391
...to whom I'm proud to have given
my best years of service.

965
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:34,390
That should get you
to the next petrol station.

966
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:38,793
Thank you very much, sir.
I'm most grateful.

967
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:40,793
But did you...

968
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,228
...share his opinions?

969
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,595
Who?

970
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:44,995
Lord Darlington.

971
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,394
I was his butler.
I was there to serve him...

972
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,949
...not to agree or disagree.

973
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:53,713
You trusted him.

974
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,197
Yes, I did. Completely.

975
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:01,875
But at the end of his life, he himself
admitted that he'd been... mistaken.

976
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:06,399
That he'd been too gullible,
and he'd let himself be taken in.

977
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,919
I see.

978
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,028
Thank you, sir.
You've been most kind.

979
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:27,195
Just keep going straight up here,
and turn left at the first crossroads.

980
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,593
I say, I don't want to be a bore,
but I'm intrigued.

981
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,831
Where do you stand on all that?

982
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:36,595
If a mistake was to be made, wouldn't
you rather have made your own?

983
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,436
Forgive me for being so inquisitive.

984
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,033
Not at all, sir.

985
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,192
In a very small way,
I did make my own mistake.

986
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:47,000
But I might have a chance
to set mine right.

987
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:50,791
In fact, I'm on my way
to try and do so now.

988
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,358
Try the ignition.

989
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,037
Thank you, sir.
I'm most grateful for your help.

990
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:05,475
Good luck.
It's been interesting talking to you.

991
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:38,996
Good morning.

992
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,834
Lord Halifax was impressed
with the silver.

993
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:45,789
I told him it was all your doing.
Sent his compliments. Well done.

994
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,994
I've been meaning to ask you...

995
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:56,431
That business last year
about the Jewish maids...

996
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:59,434
...I suppose there's no way
of tracing them?

997
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:03,639
That would be difficult. I tried
to get them a position in Surrey.

998
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:07,589
There was room only for one,
and they didn't want to be separated.

999
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:12,591
Well, try anyway. One would like
to do something for them.

1000
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,030
It was wrong, what occurred.

1001
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:18,518
I'm sorry about it. Very sorry.

1002
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,671
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1003
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,112
He asked about the Jewish girls.

1004
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:31,238
- Elsa and Irma?
- He wondered where they were.

1005
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,596
He said it was wrong
to dismiss them.

1006
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:37,395
I remember you were
as distressed as I was about it.

1007
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:39,073
As you were?

1008
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:43,793
You thought it was right and proper
that they should be sent packing.

1009
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,995
Now, really, that is most unfair.

1010
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,470
Of course I was upset.
Very much so.

1011
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,591
I don't like that happening here.

1012
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:56,755
I wish you'd told me. It would've
helped me to know you felt as I did.

1013
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:00,117
Why do you always have to hide
what you feel?

1014
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:08,997
Have you finished the lavender bags?
Good.

1015
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:10,555
All right.

1016
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,396
I take my hat off to you.

1017
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:29,388
That girl's come along very well.
You were right and I was wrong.

1018
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:34,352
- Look at that smile on your face.
- What smile?

1019
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,070
That tells a story in itself.

1020
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,878
Wouldn't you say so?

1021
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,796
What story's that?

1022
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,195
She's a pretty girl, don't you think?

1023
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,515
Is she?

1024
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:50,755
You don't like pretty girls
on the staff. I've noticed.

1025
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,718
Might it be that our Mr. Stevens
fears distraction?

1026
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:00,995
Can it be that Mr. Stevens is flesh
and blood and cannot trust himself?

1027
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,716
You know what I'm doing?

1028
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:07,191
I'm placing my thoughts elsewhere
while you chatter away.

1029
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:09,595
Why is that guilty smile
still on your face?

1030
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,799
Not guilty, simply amused
by the nonsense you sometimes talk.

1031
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:17,316
It is a guilty smile.
You can't bear to look at her.

1032
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:20,028
You didn't want her.
She was too pretty.

1033
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,838
You must be right.

1034
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,559
You always are.

1035
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:34,316
Charlie!

1036
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:51,630
Lizzie, aren't you supposed to be
turning down the beds?

1037
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:54,314
Well, you better get on with it, then.

1038
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:03,238
Have you told her yet?
You better get on with it, then.

1039
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,835
What can I say to her?
She'd never understand.

1040
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:09,311
- Why not?
- She's old. She must be at least 30.

1041
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,118
Perhaps she doesn't feel old.

1042
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:14,875
Who do you think those flowers
are for she's been picking?

1043
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:17,549
Come here. Give us a kiss.

1044
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:30,195
Flowers.

1045
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:32,749
Flowers.

1046
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:35,838
You're reading.

1047
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,832
It's very dim. Can you see?

1048
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,354
Yes, thank you.

1049
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,359
What are you reading?

1050
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:44,915
A book.

1051
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,513
Yes, but what sort of book?

1052
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,513
It's a book, Miss Kenton.
A book.

1053
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:55,079
What's the book?

1054
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,637
Are you shy about your book?

1055
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:01,508
What is it?

1056
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:05,708
Is it racy?

1057
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,069
Racy?

1058
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,710
Are you reading a racy book?

1059
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:16,110
Do you think racy books are to be
found in His Lordship's shelves?

1060
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,793
How would I know?

1061
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,279
What is it?

1062
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,829
Let me see it.
Let me see your book.

1063
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,438
Please leave me alone.

1064
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,830
Why won't you show me your book?

1065
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,514
This is my private time.
You're invading it.

1066
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,193
Is that so?

1067
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,949
I'm invading your private time,
am I?

1068
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,038
What's in that book?

1069
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,196
Come on, let me see.

1070
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,353
Or are you protecting me?
Is that what you're doing?

1071
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,112
Would I be shocked?

1072
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,950
Would it ruin my character?

1073
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:57,393
Let me see it.

1074
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,468
Oh, dear.

1075
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,318
It's not scandalous at all.

1076
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,472
It's just a sentimental
old love story.

1077
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,511
I read these books...

1078
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,353
...any books...

1079
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,759
...to develop my command and knowledge
of the English language.

1080
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:52,475
I read to further my education,
Miss Kenton.

1081
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,149
I really must ask you, please...

1082
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:03,670
...not to disturb the few moments
I have to myself.

1083
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,675
Come in.

1084
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,434
What is it?

1085
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,514
I'm wanting to give you
my notice, please.

1086
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:46,956
Why?

1087
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,716
Charlie and me, we're getting married.

1088
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,470
Have you thought about this carefully?

1089
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,796
Yes, Miss Kenton, I have.

1090
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:03,796
You've been getting on well here and
could have a fine career before you.

1091
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,794
Charlie and me's getting married.

1092
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,036
Charlie and I.

1093
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:10,794
I wish I knew what to say to you.

1094
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,635
I've seen this happen so many times.

1095
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:17,759
A young girl rushing into marriage
only to be disappointed in the end.

1096
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,075
What about money?

1097
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,268
We don't have any.

1098
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:24,675
But who cares?

1099
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:29,554
You'll find it's not easy
to live poor.

1100
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:32,432
We have each other.

1101
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,396
That's all anyone can ever need.

1102
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,554
Very well.

1103
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,759
If you're so sure.

1104
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:47,789
Thank you.

1105
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,108
Good luck.

1106
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:09,630
We did all we could for them.

1107
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:11,593
I told him...

1108
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:15,636
...I had my eye on him
as a possible under-butler...

1109
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:17,836
...in a year or so.

1110
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:21,835
But, no, Mr. Charlie knows best.

1111
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,630
She's sure to be let down.

1112
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,638
No use crying over spilt milk.

1113
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:35,236
Besides, we have far more
important matters to discuss.

1114
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:39,029
- Next week's meeting. Now...
- Must we discuss it tonight?

1115
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,315
Sorry?

1116
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:45,598
I'm tired.

1117
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:49,558
I've had a busy day.
Don't you realize that?

1118
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:52,272
I'm very tired.

1119
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,756
I'm very, very tired.

1120
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,632
Don't you understand?

1121
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:08,033
I owe you an apology.
I thought...

1122
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:11,317
...these quiet evening talks
were useful to our work.

1123
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:14,120
But now I see that they're
a burden to you.

1124
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:16,794
I was only saying I was tired tonight.

1125
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,359
No, no. You're right.

1126
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:22,479
Our meetings are a burden
after a long day.

1127
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:25,792
Perhaps we'd better discontinue them.

1128
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,389
They're useful.
It was only tonight.

1129
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,192
I thank you for the cocoa.

1130
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:33,631
In the future, we shall communicate
only during the day.

1131
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:36,110
If necessary, by written message.

1132
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,791
I wish you a very good night.

1133
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:45,548
I shall be taking my day off tomorrow.

1134
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,911
I'll be back in the house by 9:30.

1135
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:50,949
Certainly.

1136
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:52,719
Certainly.

1137
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,308
Good night.

1138
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,189
I'm glad to be out of it,
I can tell you.

1139
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:34,910
There was something about Sir Geoffrey
and his Black Shirts...

1140
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,918
...gave me the creeps.

1141
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,835
Mr. Stevens says we should
run the house...

1142
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,594
...and leave the rest
where it belongs.

1143
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,231
You don't agree, Mr. Benn.

1144
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:50,073
Nor do I, really.

1145
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:54,829
If I don't like something,
I want to say <i>"</i>stuff it<i>"</i>...

1146
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,640
...if you'll pardon the expression,
Miss Kenton.

1147
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:02,158
But then I suppose I'm not
a real professional, like Mr. Stevens.

1148
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:06,790
It's Mr. Stevens' whole life.

1149
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:09,632
Well, it's not mine.

1150
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:11,791
And to tell you the truth...

1151
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:14,395
...I don't want to go back in service.

1152
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:18,755
- What would you do instead, Mr. Benn?
- Tom's the name.

1153
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:22,354
Tom.

1154
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:25,836
What employment would you take up?

1155
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,834
I'd really like to be on my own.

1156
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:33,437
Start a little shop somewhere,
newspapers and tobacco.

1157
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:37,719
Or a boarding house in the
west country, where I come from.

1158
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:40,633
Clevedon's a good place for
a boarding house.

1159
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,757
Would I get you another shandy?

1160
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:46,190
Well, it's almost 9:30...

1161
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,833
Go on!

1162
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,672
It's your day off, isn't it?

1163
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:52,519
You're not in the army,
due back in the barracks.

1164
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:54,398
- All right, then.
- Good.

1165
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,313
Half a shandy, please.

1166
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:15,635
What about yourself, then, Sarah?

1167
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:17,791
That's a serious sort of a name.

1168
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:20,235
They called me Sally
when my mum was alive.

1169
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,152
Sally. That's nice.

1170
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:29,592
Is it your intention
to remain in service?

1171
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:32,314
It's a good profession,
when you have a position.

1172
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:36,189
- Mr. Stevens says we're fortunate...
- We're not talking about him.

1173
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:38,476
We're talking about you.

1174
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,592
Supposing...

1175
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:45,590
...someone asked if you'd like to come
in on a boarding house by the sea?

1176
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,239
What would you say?

1177
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:50,193
Well, I don't know.

1178
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:54,029
It's a theoretical question,
so I haven't given it any thought...

1179
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:56,191
...Mr. Benn.
- Tom.

1180
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:00,116
Supposing it wasn't theoretical...

1181
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:01,990
...Sally?

1182
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:07,197
It's been years since I've been
called that. It feels funny.

1183
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,674
Nice, though?

1184
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:36,633
It's very late.

1185
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:21,432
Will there be anything else?

1186
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:22,669
What?

1187
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:30,431
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night, my lord.

1188
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:46,428
Mr. Cardinal, good evening.

1189
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:48,238
- How are you?
- Very well.

1190
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,392
- Delighted. And your wife?
- Very well too, sir.

1191
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:54,398
- How are you?
- Very well, sir.

1192
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:58,115
I've gone and got myself in a bit
of a mess with arrangements.

1193
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:00,112
Would His Lordship put me up?

1194
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:02,191
I'll tell him you're here.

1195
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:04,591
I hope there's nothing special tonight.

1196
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:07,314
His Lordship expects
some gentlemen after dinner.

1197
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:11,433
I'll keep my head down, then.
I've got to write my column anyway.

1198
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:14,911
- You're in time for dinner, if you like.
- I hoped I would be.

1199
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:17,037
How is my godfather? Fit?

1200
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:19,236
Very well. Some refreshment?

1201
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:21,835
Thank you.
Some whisky would be lovely.

1202
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:25,789
- Who's he expecting tonight?
- I am unable to help you there.

1203
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:26,989
What, no idea?

1204
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,031
No idea at all, sir.

1205
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:34,319
- I'll keep my head down all the same.
- I think it's a good idea, sir.

1206
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:38,029
Come in.

1207
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:45,392
Mr. Cardinal has just arrived,
out of the blue.

1208
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:47,551
He'll expect his usual room.

1209
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:51,513
- I'll see to it before I leave.
- You're going out?

1210
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:52,709
I am indeed.

1211
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:53,836
It's Thursday.

1212
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:56,470
Of course. I'd forgotten. Sorry.

1213
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:58,233
Is something the matter?

1214
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:03,952
Some visitors are arriving,
but it doesn't involve you.

1215
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:07,192
We agreed that Thursday
is my day off...

1216
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:09,715
...but if you need me urgently...

1217
01:37:09,960 --> 01:37:12,269
No, it's perfectly all right.
Thank you.

1218
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:18,157
I have something to tell you.

1219
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:21,475
My friend...

1220
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:25,470
...the man I'm meeting, Mr. Benn.

1221
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,031
Mr. Benn. Of course. Yes.

1222
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,675
He has asked me to marry him.

1223
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:40,272
I am thinking about it.

1224
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:42,194
I see.

1225
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:46,235
He's moving to the west country
next month.

1226
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:55,596
I'm still thinking about it.

1227
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:59,718
I thought you should be informed
of the situation.

1228
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:04,668
Yes, thank you.

1229
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:07,033
That's most kind of you.

1230
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:15,877
I trust you'll have
a most pleasant evening.

1231
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,476
Is there something special tonight?

1232
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,518
Are your visitors special?

1233
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:39,032
Can't tell you, my boy.
Strictly confidential.

1234
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:42,278
- So I can't sit in on it?
- On what?

1235
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:46,076
- Whatever it is that's taking place.
- Absolutely not.

1236
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:50,270
Can't have someone like you sticking
your nose in. A journalist.

1237
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:52,670
What do you call it, a <i>"</i> newshound<i>"</i>?

1238
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:54,952
No, it wouldn't do at all.

1239
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:58,950
Once you've had your food,
you'd better make yourself scarce.

1240
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,470
It sounds pretty special to me.

1241
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:33,391
Good evening, prime minister.

1242
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:35,710
- Sorry, we've been delayed.
- I understand.

1243
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:37,188
Lord Halifax.

1244
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:40,913
- Very nice to see you.
- This is Mr. Fraser.

1245
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:54,192
Good evening, Your Excellency.

1246
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:03,515
Please wait here, Your Excellency.
I'll inform His Lordship.

1247
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:55,909
We don't intend to involve
the whole British Empire in a war...

1248
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:59,709
...simply because of a quarrel
in a faraway country...

1249
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:03,396
...between people of whom
we know nothing.

1250
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:06,314
To my mind, the whole
of Czechoslovakia...

1251
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:09,074
...isn't worth a single
one of our own young men.

1252
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,794
We have a small, noisy
and corrupt war group here...

1253
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:16,875
...who don't realize that you Germans
are marching into your own back yard.

1254
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:22,633
The <i>Fhrer</i> is a man of peace
to the depth of his soul...

1255
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:26,478
...but he won't allow
a small second-rate country...

1256
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:30,474
...to thumb its nose
at the 1000-year German Reich.

1257
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:46,115
I'll get it.

1258
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:48,914
Come on, wake up!

1259
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:50,715
Stay awake!

1260
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:01,591
Could you confirm that this lady
is on the staff here?

1261
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,718
Yes, of course.
She's the housekeeper.

1262
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,109
Thank you, sir.

1263
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:08,116
- May I?
- Of course.

1264
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:09,713
Sorry to have alarmed you.

1265
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:11,996
Just security, miss.

1266
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:19,150
I trust you've had a pleasant evening.

1267
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:24,919
Well, did you have a pleasant evening?

1268
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:26,673
- Yes, thank you.
- Good.

1269
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:29,713
Would you like to know
what took place?

1270
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,871
I have to return upstairs.

1271
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:36,197
There are important events
taking place tonight.

1272
01:42:38,240 --> 01:42:39,639
When are there not?

1273
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:45,469
I accepted his proposal.

1274
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:49,148
I accepted Mr. Benn's proposal
of marriage.

1275
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,115
My congratulations.

1276
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:53,271
I am prepared to serve out my notice.

1277
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:56,870
But if you'd release me earlier,
I'd be grateful.

1278
01:42:57,160 --> 01:43:00,755
Mr. Benn is planning to leave
for the west country in two weeks.

1279
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:02,673
I'll do my best.

1280
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:05,112
Now, please excuse me.

1281
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:16,271
After all the years I have been here,
you have nothing else to say?

1282
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:21,072
You have my warmest congratulations.

1283
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,799
You've been a very important figure...

1284
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:28,598
...for Mr. Benn and me.

1285
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:31,272
Oh, in what way?

1286
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:34,673
I tell him all sorts
of things about you.

1287
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:38,237
I tell him stories about you.
About your habits.

1288
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:40,992
About your mannerisms.

1289
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:44,277
He finds it very funny,
especially when I show him how...

1290
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:47,518
...you pinch your nose
when you put pepper on your food.

1291
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:50,228
That always has us in stitches.

1292
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:57,192
Does it, indeed?

1293
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:03,279
Well, please...

1294
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:05,631
...excuse me, Miss Kenton.

1295
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:07,715
Good night.

1296
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:31,515
Thanks.

1297
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:37,796
We've been friends a long time,
haven't we?

1298
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:42,038
I always look forward to a chat
when I come here.

1299
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:44,669
Would you care to join me in a drink?

1300
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:47,110
That's most kind of you,
but no, thank you.

1301
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,634
You all right?

1302
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:50,114
I'm perfectly all right.

1303
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:52,351
Not feeling unwell, are you?

1304
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:54,959
A little tired, perhaps.

1305
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:57,879
I bet you're tired.
What is it, about 1:00?

1306
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:59,235
Come on.

1307
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:01,113
I want you to sit down.

1308
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:02,833
Well, sir, I really...

1309
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:11,998
I didn't come here by accident.

1310
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:13,389
You know that.

1311
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:16,152
I had a tip-off, you see...

1312
01:45:16,360 --> 01:45:19,557
...about what's going on now
in the library.

1313
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:24,115
I wish you'd sit down.
I'm your friend...

1314
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:27,989
...and you're holding that tray
as if you're about to wander off!

1315
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:30,151
Now, come on.
Sit down, damn it!

1316
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,275
That's better.

1317
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:40,231
Now, look, I don't suppose the prime
minister is in the library, is he?

1318
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:42,073
Prime minister, sir?

1319
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:45,470
In the library...
You don't have to confirm it...

1320
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:49,832
- are our prime minister, our foreign
secretary and the German ambassador.

1321
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:53,872
- Any idea what they're talking about?
- I'm afraid not.

1322
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:56,680
Tell me, Stevens,
don't you care at all?

1323
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,990
Aren't you in the least bit curious?

1324
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:02,113
It's not my place to be curious
about such matters.

1325
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:03,873
Not your place.

1326
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:06,710
And supposing I told you
that His Lordship...

1327
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:09,155
...is trying to persuade
the prime minister...

1328
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:12,750
...to enter into a pact with that
bunch of criminals in Berlin?

1329
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:16,868
I'm certain His Lordship is acting
from the highest and noblest motives.

1330
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:20,476
Don't you see? That's exactly
what makes it so abominable!

1331
01:46:20,680 --> 01:46:24,673
Twisting these high and noble
motives to their own foul ends!

1332
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:28,270
You do, please, realize
that His Lordship's been the most...

1333
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:31,876
...valuable pawn that the Nazis
have in this country...

1334
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:34,839
...precisely because he is good
and honourable?

1335
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:38,273
If I weren't so drunk,
I could make you understand!

1336
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:40,230
Sir...

1337
01:46:40,840 --> 01:46:42,398
...I do understand.

1338
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:46,318
His Lordship is working
to ensure peace in our time.

1339
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:49,472
Peace in our time
on their beastly terms!

1340
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:52,280
Remember that American here
at the conference?

1341
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:55,392
Called Lord Darlington an amateur,
out of his depth?

1342
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:56,789
Well, he was right.

1343
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:58,439
He was dead right.

1344
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:02,669
I hardly have to tell you
how I feel towards His Lordship.

1345
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:06,276
I care about him deeply,
and I know you do too.

1346
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:07,549
Yes, I do indeed.

1347
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:11,236
Then aren't you desperate
to see him make this mistake?

1348
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:16,555
He's being tricked! Don't you see?
Or are you as deluded as he is?

1349
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:20,150
Oh, dear. Now I've probably
offended you.

1350
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:22,273
No. Not at all, sir.

1351
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:24,589
Not at all.

1352
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:31,268
You must excuse me.

1353
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:35,670
There are other gentlemen
calling for me, sir.

1354
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:08,519
You mustn't take anything
I said to heart.

1355
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:12,633
I was very foolish a little while ago.

1356
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:19,035
I haven't taken anything
you said to heart.

1357
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:23,552
In fact, I can hardly recall
anything you did say.

1358
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:25,717
I was just being very foolish.

1359
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:31,156
I simply haven't time to stand here
with you, engaging in idle talk.

1360
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:35,713
I suggest you go to bed now.
You must be very tired.

1361
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:37,279
Good night.

1362
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:19,599
Oh, damn it!

1363
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:20,875
Blast!

1364
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:33,275
I'd been wanting to tell you...

1365
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:38,069
It's the small alcove outside
the breakfast room.

1366
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:40,916
It's the new girl, of course...

1367
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:45,350
...but I find it has not
been dusted in some time.

1368
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:51,110
I'll see to it.

1369
01:50:51,720 --> 01:50:52,789
Thank you.

1370
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:56,193
I knew you would have wanted
to be informed.

1371
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:41,275
Hello, Sally.

1372
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:42,549
Hi, Tom.

1373
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:44,879
You all right, then?

1374
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:46,468
How are you?

1375
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:47,795
I'm good.

1376
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:54,112
Could we talk for a moment, please?
Just for a moment.

1377
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:56,590
We'll have to be quick
because I'm going out.

1378
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:58,273
It won't take long.

1379
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:02,074
All right, then.
We'll have to go into the lounge.

1380
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:08,309
Afternoon.

1381
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:15,951
Nice little place, isn't it?

1382
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:20,315
The sort of quiet little
boarding house I had in mind for us.

1383
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:25,511
Like other things, it didn't work out.

1384
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,716
What did you want to say?

1385
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:33,389
I saw Catherine yesterday.
She had some interesting news.

1386
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:36,395
She's expecting.

1387
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:37,550
Oh, my goodness!

1388
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:45,480
She wants us both over
for tea on Sunday.

1389
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:49,477
I could come and get you.

1390
01:53:50,840 --> 01:53:52,910
We could go together on the bus.

1391
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,797
Yes, well, we'll see about that.

1392
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:00,911
House is that empty without you.

1393
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:04,633
I can't tell you.

1394
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:09,872
You cut yourself shaving.

1395
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:11,713
Oh, yeah. I know.

1396
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,390
Can't seem to do anything right
these days.

1397
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:26,113
<i>I so often think</i>
<i>of the good old days...</i>

1398
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:28,749
<i>... when I was housekeeper</i>
<i>at Darlington Hall.</i>

1399
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:32,077
<i>Those years with you</i>
<i>were the happiest of my life.</i>

1400
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,833
Would you like more tea?

1401
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:36,199
Yes, please. Thank you.

1402
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:38,791
Miss Kenton.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Benn.

1403
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:41,713
- Sorry, I was delayed.
- That's all right.

1404
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:42,836
Please sit down.

1405
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:48,308
- I've ordered some fresh tea.
- Lovely.

1406
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:50,397
Would you like some cake?

1407
01:54:50,640 --> 01:54:53,279
- Sure?
- All right. It's a special occasion.

1408
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:54,276
Good.

1409
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:56,029
Waitress?

1410
01:54:57,160 --> 01:54:59,833
- Could we have some cake?
- Yes, of course.

1411
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:04,392
- It's been a long time.
- Yes, indeed.

1412
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:06,278
You haven't changed at all.

1413
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:09,753
A little, perhaps.

1414
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:11,552
We've all changed, I think.

1415
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:13,591
I'd have known you anywhere.

1416
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:20,911
How long's it been?
Twenty years?

1417
01:55:21,160 --> 01:55:22,593
Yes, just over, I think.

1418
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:25,117
The tea should be along.

1419
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:48,796
We read about the suit for libel.

1420
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:50,632
It's a shame...

1421
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:54,909
...calling His Lordship a traitor.
Those papers will print anything.

1422
01:55:55,160 --> 01:55:57,151
They should have lost the case.

1423
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:00,516
When His Lordship went to court...

1424
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:03,752
...he sincerely expected
he would get justice.

1425
01:56:05,240 --> 01:56:08,277
Instead, the newspaper increased
its circulation, and His Lordship's...

1426
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:10,715
...good name was destroyed forever.

1427
01:56:12,760 --> 01:56:15,069
Afterwards, in his last years, well...

1428
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:17,910
...quite honestly, Mrs. Benn...

1429
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:19,875
...his heart was broken.

1430
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:25,271
I'd take him tea in the library,
and he'd be sitting there...

1431
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:28,796
...and he wouldn't even see me,
so deep was he in his own thoughts.

1432
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:35,479
And he'd be talking to himself,
as though he was arguing with someone.

1433
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:37,796
There was no one, of course.

1434
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:40,232
No one came to see him anymore.

1435
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:45,114
What about his godson,
young Mr. Cardinal?

1436
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:47,675
Mr. Cardinal was killed in the war.
Waitress.

1437
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:49,592
May I have my bill, please?

1438
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:53,279
I'm very sorry.

1439
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:05,916
I know you remember Darlington Hall
in its best days...

1440
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:10,278
...and that's how His Lordship
deserves to be remembered.

1441
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:13,756
But perhaps the good days are back,
now that Mr. Lewis is here...

1442
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,991
...and Mrs. Lewis is arriving shortly.

1443
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:18,993
Very fortunate to have you
running the house.

1444
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:23,677
We still have problems, Miss Kenton.
I'm sorry. Mrs. Benn.

1445
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:28,112
- We still have staff problems.
- You mentioned it in your letter.

1446
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:33,594
Frankly, I've been thinking
of going back in service.

1447
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:35,075
Good...

1448
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:38,713
But now the situation
has changed for me.

1449
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:41,474
If I take up any work,
it will have to be...

1450
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:43,910
...here in the west country...

1451
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:48,313
...because Catherine, our daughter,
is expecting a baby.

1452
01:57:50,240 --> 01:57:52,151
So I would like to be near her.

1453
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:53,435
Of course.

1454
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:57,313
And to be near our grandchild
as he grows up.

1455
01:57:57,560 --> 01:58:01,951
- Naturally.
- Or her, if it's a little girl.

1456
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:12,279
When I left Darlington Hall,
all those years ago...

1457
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:15,631
...I never realized I was really,
truly leaving.

1458
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:20,155
I believe I thought of it
as simply another ruse...

1459
01:58:20,360 --> 01:58:21,713
...to annoy you.

1460
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:27,190
It was a shock to come out here
and find myself actually married.

1461
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:29,431
For a long time, I was...

1462
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:31,238
...very unhappy.

1463
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:35,870
But then Catherine was born,
the years went by and one day...

1464
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:38,310
...I realized I loved my husband.

1465
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:41,754
You see, there is no one...

1466
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:46,479
...no one in the world who needs me
as much as he does.

1467
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,231
But still there are times...

1468
01:58:51,560 --> 01:58:55,553
...when I think I made a terrible
mistake with my life.

1469
01:58:58,360 --> 01:59:01,079
I'm sure we all have these thoughts...

1470
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:02,633
...from time to time.

1471
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:41,038
People always cheer when they turn
the lights on in the evening.

1472
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:42,389
I wonder why.

1473
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:45,234
They do say...

1474
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:49,794
...that for many people, the evening's
the best part of the day.

1475
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:52,595
The part they most look forward to.

1476
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:54,752
Is that so?

1477
01:59:56,240 --> 01:59:59,357
What do you most look forward to?

1478
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:06,069
Getting back to Darlington Hall,
principally...

1479
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:08,754
...and straightening out
our staff problems.

1480
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:11,514
You were always able to do that.

1481
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:15,477
And you had quite a few
to straighten out, as I remember.

1482
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:21,833
Always was work, work
and more work...

1483
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:25,153
...and will continue to be so,
I have no doubt.

1484
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:41,555
Mr. Stevens, don't you wait!
That bus is always late.

1485
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:43,512
Come in out of the wet.

1486
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:53,071
You must take good care of yourself.

1487
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:57,674
- You too, promise me that.
- Oh, yes, I promise.

1488
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:02,556
Do all you can to make these years
happy for yourself and your husband.

1489
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:05,271
We may never meet again, Mrs. Benn.

1490
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:08,956
That is why I am being personal,
if you will forgive me.

1491
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:12,471
Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

1492
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:15,354
Oh, here it comes.
It's on time for once.

1493
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:39,318
Thank you. And thank you
so very much for coming.

1494
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:41,312
It was so very kind of you.

1495
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:42,959
It was so nice to see you.

1496
02:01:43,320 --> 02:01:46,278
It was a pleasure to see you again.
Goodbye.

1497
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:47,949
Take care.

1498
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:36,475
You scared me.
Where'd you come from?

1499
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:39,029
You like the suit?

1500
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:40,389
Very good, sir.

1501
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:49,076
Good.

1502
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:54,872
Watch the chandelier there.

1503
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:09,275
You're really getting things
going here. This is wonderful!

1504
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:14,919
I've had to ask another three girls
from the village to come up.

1505
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:18,516
And I can promise you that
the house will be ready...

1506
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:21,069
...and in shape by the time
Mrs. Lewis arrives.

1507
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:23,072
That sounds good.

1508
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:27,192
I'm expecting a possible
new housekeeper this afternoon.

1509
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:29,032
A Mrs. Ruth Muspratt.

1510
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:34,070
Excellent references. She was matron
at a boys' school in Sussex.

1511
02:03:34,360 --> 02:03:35,554
A matron?

1512
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:39,875
Sounds like she'll keep us
from misbehaving.

1513
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:42,992
- I certainly hope so, sir.
- Good.

1514
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:45,117
Good, Stevens. Very good.

1515
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:48,670
This is where we had that banquet
back in '35. Remember?

1516
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:52,589
We all stood up and delivered
ourselves of our principles.

1517
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:56,389
God knows what I said.
Sure got worked up about it, though.

1518
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:58,791
What did I say, anyway?

1519
02:04:00,440 --> 02:04:03,000
I'm sorry, sir,
I was too busy serving...

1520
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:05,231
...to listen to the speeches.

1521
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:12,752
We got a visitor here.

1522
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:15,313
Be very careful.

1523
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:17,630
Come here.
That's a boy. Come on.

1524
02:04:19,480 --> 02:04:20,913
Okay. Easy does it.

1525
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:24,795
Come on!

1526
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:29,638
You don't want to startle it.

1527
02:04:30,160 --> 02:04:31,309
It'll come down.

1528
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:37,596
I think if we
leave the window open...

1529
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:44,436
Good.

1530
02:04:45,080 --> 02:04:46,115
Very still.

1531
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:48,396
Go on. Out!
Come on. Out!

1532
02:04:49,840 --> 02:04:51,114
Well done.

1533
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:56,199
Well done, sir.

1534
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:35,109
