1
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,671
August, 1962
was a stormy time for France.

2
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,339
Many people felt that
President Charles De Gaulle...

3
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:35,014
...had betrayed the country
by giving independence to Algeria.

4
00:00:35,932 --> 00:00:38,475
Extremists, mostly from the army...

5
00:00:38,642 --> 00:00:40,852
...swore to kill him in revenge.

6
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:44,230
They banded together
in an underground movement...

7
00:00:44,438 --> 00:00:47,899
...and called themselves the OAS.

8
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:35,910
The Minister's meeting is over!

9
00:04:49,203 --> 00:04:50,621
They're very late.

10
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:22,614
The time elapsed from the first
to the last shot was seven seconds.

11
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,784
In all, more than 140 shots were fired.

12
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,912
Several bullets pierced the President's car.

13
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:32,497
One came within an inch of his head.

14
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:37,756
But, as if by a miracle,
neither he nor anyone else was hurt.

15
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:41,050
Six months later:

16
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:44,971
Most of the conspirators
have been caught and tried.

17
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:48,848
Their leader, Colonel Bastien-Thiry,
has been sentenced to death.

18
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:53,899
At the last moment, his lawyer
tries one more time for a stay of execution.

19
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:13,585
The appeal for clemency
has been turned down.

20
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:15,712
There is nothing more one can do.

21
00:06:15,963 --> 00:06:17,172
I am sorry.

22
00:06:18,006 --> 00:06:19,258
There is no need.

23
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:22,843
For heaven's sake,
don't you realize you're going to be shot?

24
00:06:23,428 --> 00:06:24,849
You don't understand.

25
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,769
No French soldier is going to raise
his rifle against me.

26
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:36,734
Fire!

27
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:42,284
Here is the 8:00 news for today,
March 11, 1963.

28
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:46,121
An hour ago, in the courtyard
of the Fort d'Ivry, outside Paris...

29
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,249
...Lieutenant Colonel Bastien-Thiry
was executed by firing squad...

30
00:06:50,332 --> 00:06:54,168
...for leading the attempt on the life
of General De Gaulle last August.

31
00:06:54,252 --> 00:06:56,588
The OAS now seems
completely demoralized...

32
00:06:56,713 --> 00:07:00,095
...by the splendid performance
of our national security forces.

33
00:07:00,304 --> 00:07:03,680
Already it is known that
the new chief of operations of the OAS...

34
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:07,184
...Colonel Mark Rodin, a former
paratroop commanderin Algeria...

35
00:07:07,476 --> 00:07:10,729
...is on the run
and hiding somewhere in Austria.

36
00:07:11,104 --> 00:07:14,607
Today's execution must surely mean
that the OAS is finished...

37
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:16,321
...once and for all.

38
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,914
What are the finances like, Ren?

39
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:31,630
No wonder our people are giving up.
They've lost faith.

40
00:07:31,713 --> 00:07:33,590
We've failed them every single time.

41
00:07:33,673 --> 00:07:34,883
We won't fail again!

42
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:36,884
What can we do? We're paralyzed.

43
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:40,637
Every cop in France knows us.
informants are all around us.

44
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:44,306
We must find an outsider. A foreigner.

45
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,560
-A foreigner? Why?
-A contract killer.

46
00:07:48,273 --> 00:07:51,735
One that hasn't worked in France,
so he won't have a police record.

47
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:55,737
-He can come and go as he pleases.
-That sort of person costs money.

48
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,239
Yes.

49
00:07:58,823 --> 00:08:00,866
I'll find the right man.

50
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:04,953
We'd better meet again
in three months, in Vienna.

51
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,377
In the pension you both know:
Pension Kleist. June 15.

52
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,296
It's a limited market.

53
00:08:12,463 --> 00:08:14,507
I've compiled 11 dossiers
over three months.

54
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,467
Only those four men
seemed anywhere near right.

55
00:08:18,425 --> 00:08:20,928
Now that you've read the files,
what do you think?

56
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:23,935
-One Englishman did all these jobs?
-I don't believe it.

57
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,063
-It's true.
-He did that fellow in the Congo?

58
00:08:27,146 --> 00:08:28,565
And Trujillo?

59
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:31,149
-Yes.
-That's our man then, isn't it?

60
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:33,485
I should say so.

61
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:35,987
I'm glad you agree on the final choice.

62
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:38,868
-Because he'll be here any moment.
-What?

63
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,705
He's arriving this afternoon from London.

64
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:11,901
Wolenski.

65
00:09:19,995 --> 00:09:22,788
A normal precaution, you understand.
Come in.

66
00:09:32,593 --> 00:09:36,053
We are not terrorists, you understand.
We are patriots.

67
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:39,556
Our duty is to the soldiers
who died fighting in Algeria...

68
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,516
...and the 3 million French citizens
who live there.

69
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,810
You want to get rid of him?

70
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,444
Speaking as a professional,
do you think it's possible?

71
00:09:50,861 --> 00:09:54,156
It's possible.
The point is getting away with it.

72
00:09:54,698 --> 00:09:57,326
As a professional,
it's an important consideration.

73
00:09:57,409 --> 00:09:59,868
In principle, you'd say it could be done?

74
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:04,585
Yes. With enough time and planning.

75
00:10:05,753 --> 00:10:08,129
It would be more difficult
than most targets.

76
00:10:08,213 --> 00:10:09,130
Why more?

77
00:10:09,214 --> 00:10:12,509
Because De Gaulle has
the best security in the world.

78
00:10:12,842 --> 00:10:14,970
Their information is first-class.

79
00:10:15,469 --> 00:10:18,472
You see, gentlemen,
not only have your own efforts failed...

80
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:20,770
...but you've queered the pitch for others.

81
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:24,438
-How dare you suggest..
-You can't afford to be emotional.

82
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:26,607
It's why you've made so many mistakes.

83
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:31,446
-If we decided to employ a professional--
-You have to employ a professional.

84
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,073
Your organization is
so riddled with informers...

85
00:10:34,156 --> 00:10:37,288
...that nothing you decide
is a secret for long.

86
00:10:38,122 --> 00:10:40,373
The job would have to be done
by an outsider.

87
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:43,585
The only question is
by whom and for how much?

88
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,796
Will you do it?

89
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:49,922
-Yes.
-How much?

90
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:52,426
Understand, this is a once-in-a-lifetime job.

91
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:54,598
-They can never work again.
-How much?

92
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:56,349
-Half a million, in cash.
-What?

93
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:58,434
Half in advance and half on completion.

94
00:10:58,517 --> 00:11:00,603
-Half a million francs?
-Dollars.

95
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:02,562
Are you mad?

96
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:06,148
Considering you'd get France in return,
I thought it a reasonable price.

97
00:11:06,523 --> 00:11:10,323
But if you can't manage it,
there's nothing more to be said.

98
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,118
We accept.

99
00:11:15,994 --> 00:11:17,954
How many people know about this?

100
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:20,332
-Just the four of us.
-Let's keep it that way.

101
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,167
This job depends on absolute secrecy.

102
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:24,960
No notes must be kept.

103
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:27,966
If any of you is captured, I shall call it off.

104
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,970
I suggest you stay in a safe place under
guard until the work is done. Agreed?

105
00:11:32,763 --> 00:11:33,805
Agreed.

106
00:11:34,723 --> 00:11:36,391
The planning will be mine.

107
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:39,893
No one else will get the details
and you won't hear from me again.

108
00:11:39,976 --> 00:11:42,938
Here's the name and account number
of my bank in Switzerland.

109
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:46,779
When they tell me the first $250,000
has been deposited, I'll move...

110
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:48,238
...provided I'm ready.

111
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:50,490
But I'll not be hurried in any way.

112
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:52,617
Agreed.

113
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,203
All I want from you is
a phone number in Paris...

114
00:11:55,286 --> 00:11:57,955
...that I can call
about changes in De Gaulle's plans.

115
00:11:58,038 --> 00:12:00,795
The contact mustn't know
who I am or what this is about.

116
00:12:00,878 --> 00:12:02,338
Send me the number by mail.

117
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,130
How do you expect us
to find the money so soon?

118
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:07,341
Use your network to rob some banks.

119
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,343
One last thing.

120
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:14,265
What code name will you use?

121
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:16,308
Why not "The Jackal"?

122
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:18,604
Why not?

123
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:23,775
There's nothing more you want from us.
You'll be working completely alone.

124
00:12:23,858 --> 00:12:27,195
Not completely.
One will have the cooperation of De Gaulle.

125
00:12:28,488 --> 00:12:33,032
He won't listen to his security service
and stay out of the public eye.

126
00:12:34,038 --> 00:12:37,292
A pleasant journey home, Mr. Jackal.

127
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:19,336
960,000 francs? This has got to stop!

128
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:21,210
You're the Chief of Action Service.

129
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:24,176
You've had 3 weeks to find out
if the OAS is involved...

130
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:27,804
-...and if they are, what are they up to?
-It is the OAS, General.

131
00:13:28,346 --> 00:13:30,473
But the ones we've caught are small fry.

132
00:13:30,681 --> 00:13:33,475
They've been ordered to do it,
but they don't know why.

133
00:13:33,558 --> 00:13:35,353
The Minister's been after me again.

134
00:13:35,436 --> 00:13:37,938
We've questioned all known OAS people.

135
00:13:38,063 --> 00:13:39,898
They know nothing.

136
00:13:39,981 --> 00:13:42,195
-What about the informers?
-Nothing.

137
00:13:42,695 --> 00:13:46,489
But we found out this morning
that Rodin and the other two are in Rome.

138
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:48,491
They arrived on June 18.

139
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:51,244
They've taken the two top floors
in Hotel Garibaldi.

140
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:54,329
-You're watching them, of course?
-Twenty-four hours a day.

141
00:15:24,764 --> 00:15:27,932
'Morning. Birth certificate, please.
Paul Oliver Duggan.

142
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:31,769
Born in the parish of Sambourne Fishley,
April 3, 1929.

143
00:15:31,894 --> 00:15:34,938
Fill in the form.
You'll find the 1929's up those stairs...

144
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:37,732
-...and left at the first gallery.
-Right. Thanks.

145
00:17:20,846 --> 00:17:22,265
Thank you, sir.

146
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:28,938
Excuse me, please.
How many krone to the pound?

147
00:17:29,563 --> 00:17:32,607
The official parity rate is 19.34.

148
00:17:48,832 --> 00:17:51,460
Hello. Two bottles of hairpin, please.

149
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:54,341
One in chestnut brown and one in gray.

150
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,094
I've only got Clairol, dear.

151
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:03,224
That's fine. And also a tin of solvent.

152
00:18:14,736 --> 00:18:17,281
-It is here.
-ls it?

153
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:32,131
Hello?

154
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:33,674
Yes.

155
00:18:34,174 --> 00:18:35,801
Hello, Zurich?

156
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:38,261
Mr. Kola, this is he.

157
00:18:38,511 --> 00:18:41,346
That's right. Account Number 50664.

158
00:18:42,514 --> 00:18:44,354
The money's been deposited.

159
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,315
How much?

160
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:10,213
Alitalia announces the departure
of Flight 127 to Genova.

161
00:19:10,297 --> 00:19:12,757
Now boarding at Gate 5.

162
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:35,367
The Hotel Garibaldi is owned
by a Frenchman with OAS sympathies.

163
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,536
Extra Action Service staff have been sent
from Paris to Rome...

164
00:19:39,703 --> 00:19:42,163
...to keep watching them around-the-clock.

165
00:19:44,123 --> 00:19:48,378
Rodin, Montclair and Casson
live at the top floor alone.

166
00:19:48,878 --> 00:19:51,259
On the next floor down
are the bodyguards...

167
00:19:51,343 --> 00:19:54,095
...ex-paratroopers or foreign legionnaires.

168
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,346
-How many?
-Eight.

169
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,684
-They're afraid of being kidnapped.
-I know Rodin. He's not a man to be afraid.

170
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,894
The lift doors on the top floor
are welded together...

171
00:20:03,978 --> 00:20:06,397
...and everything goes through
the bodyguards.

172
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,029
Not one of them has set a foot
outside the hotel for five weeks.

173
00:20:10,113 --> 00:20:12,823
The only contact
with the outside world is one man:

174
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:15,659
-Adjutant Wolenski.
-Tell me about him.

175
00:20:15,742 --> 00:20:17,703
Bersie, run the film, please.

176
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,753
This is Wolenski.

177
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:27,881
He goes to the post office
every morning and afternoon.

178
00:20:32,135 --> 00:20:33,511
See that?

179
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:37,639
You'll have to cut his hand off
to get the mail away from him.

180
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:54,866
He always waits until the collection van
arrives before he posts any letters.

181
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:56,783
Then he goes to pick up the mail.

182
00:21:05,128 --> 00:21:09,090
All their mail comes to general delivery
and is addressed in the name of Partrier.

183
00:21:09,591 --> 00:21:12,509
Wolenski, of course,
can identify himself as such.

184
00:21:18,018 --> 00:21:19,394
Colonel Rolland here.

185
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:23,314
I want everything you've got
in the archives on a foreign legionnaire.

186
00:21:23,397 --> 00:21:25,024
His name is Viktor Wolenski.

187
00:21:25,107 --> 00:21:29,445
If the OAS is planning something big,
their agents must be working on it now.

188
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:32,535
You must find out who they are
and where they make contact.

189
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:58,019
I let myself in.

190
00:22:00,311 --> 00:22:02,271
I'll make us some coffee.

191
00:22:05,736 --> 00:22:07,196
Denise.

192
00:22:10,074 --> 00:22:13,576
I ask you to get rid of these.
It's for your own safety.

193
00:22:14,661 --> 00:22:16,079
I'll do it tonight.

194
00:22:16,204 --> 00:22:18,372
Maybe I should do it for you now.

195
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:23,214
They know all about your fianc.

196
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,475
I have an assignment for you
that sounds very important.

197
00:22:37,938 --> 00:22:39,648
It's not very pleasant.

198
00:22:41,941 --> 00:22:43,276
Go on.

199
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,701
They want you to get involved
with an official of the lyse Palace...

200
00:22:53,327 --> 00:22:55,458
...someone fairly close to De Gaulle.

201
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,377
It might be dangerous.

202
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,920
It's certainly distasteful.

203
00:23:05,507 --> 00:23:07,300
Who is this official?

204
00:23:07,508 --> 00:23:10,136
I'll show him to you in a week or so.

205
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,960
Good afternoon.

206
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,169
Yes, please come in.

207
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,678
You think you can do it?

208
00:23:46,845 --> 00:23:48,013
Certainly.

209
00:23:48,097 --> 00:23:51,099
I can take an existing gun,
make the modifications.

210
00:23:51,182 --> 00:23:54,936
It must be very light in weight,
and it must have a short barrel.

211
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:58,063
A short barrel. That's a pity.

212
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:02,530
Lastly, there must be a silencer
and a telescopic sight.

213
00:24:05,782 --> 00:24:08,742
Over what range will you fire?

214
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:12,579
I'm not sure yet,
but probably not more than 400 feet.

215
00:24:12,705 --> 00:24:15,624
-Will the gentleman be moving?
-Stationary.

216
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:19,006
Will you go for a head shot
or a chest shot?

217
00:24:19,256 --> 00:24:20,799
Probably head.

218
00:24:20,966 --> 00:24:23,134
What about the chances of a second shot?

219
00:24:23,217 --> 00:24:25,386
I might get the chance, but I doubt it.

220
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,139
In any event, I'll need a silencer to escape.

221
00:24:29,015 --> 00:24:31,724
In that case,
you better have explosive bullets.

222
00:24:32,474 --> 00:24:36,358
-I can prepare a handful for you.
-Glycerin or mercury?

223
00:24:37,484 --> 00:24:39,527
Mercury, I think.

224
00:24:41,404 --> 00:24:43,196
It's much cleaner.

225
00:24:43,905 --> 00:24:46,241
-More Campari?
-No, thank you.

226
00:24:46,825 --> 00:24:48,200
It seems then...

227
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:52,207
...the gun must be carried past customs
without arousing suspicion.

228
00:24:55,629 --> 00:24:57,420
Recognize that?

229
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,843
The whole thing should be made
of hollow aluminium tubes...

230
00:25:04,926 --> 00:25:07,512
...which screw together. The top one...

231
00:25:07,763 --> 00:25:11,936
...holds the rifle strut. The one below,
the bolt with the breech inside it.

232
00:25:12,562 --> 00:25:15,523
The shoulder rest of the rifle
doubles for both purposes...

233
00:25:15,607 --> 00:25:18,193
-...without changing in any way.
-That's excellent.

234
00:25:18,276 --> 00:25:21,611
The last two sections house
the telescopic sight and silencer.

235
00:25:21,986 --> 00:25:23,404
Here.

236
00:25:25,406 --> 00:25:28,955
It's very remarkable. It's so simple.

237
00:25:29,081 --> 00:25:31,457
I shall need the gun in about two weeks.

238
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:35,001
If you could meet me here...

239
00:25:36,003 --> 00:25:39,714
...August 13, you could try out
the gun and discuss last minute details.

240
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:41,633
Very well. August 13.

241
00:25:41,716 --> 00:25:43,847
Now the question of your fee.

242
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:53,271
I have to ask a fee of 1,000 pounds
for this kind of a job...

243
00:25:54,189 --> 00:25:56,733
...you see and, say...

244
00:25:56,858 --> 00:26:00,782
...another 100 or 200 pounds
for the raw materials.

245
00:26:01,616 --> 00:26:02,867
Done.

246
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:07,746
I'll pay you half the fee now
and the rest on delivery.

247
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,574
What do you think? Marvelous?

248
00:26:43,451 --> 00:26:46,494
I knew you didn't come to Genova
for a driver's license.

249
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:48,913
Anyone in London could've done that.

250
00:26:50,335 --> 00:26:53,087
Problem is I won't have time
to play around with makeup.

251
00:26:53,171 --> 00:26:56,173
-I'm not much good at it anyway.
-Forget about makeup.

252
00:26:56,256 --> 00:27:00,053
The important thing is the skin.
It must look gray and tired.

253
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:04,680
We used a trick in the army to fake illness
and get out of fatigue duty.

254
00:27:04,764 --> 00:27:08,063
-Can you get hold of some cordite?
-I suppose so.

255
00:27:08,563 --> 00:27:11,190
You swallow a couple
of small pieces of cordite.

256
00:27:11,273 --> 00:27:14,777
It'll make you feel sick
and turn the skin a gray color.

257
00:27:14,984 --> 00:27:16,277
After about an hour...

258
00:27:16,361 --> 00:27:19,781
...you'll feel all right again,
but your skin looks gray much longer.

259
00:27:19,864 --> 00:27:21,324
I'll try it.

260
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,330
What about the French documents?

261
00:27:23,705 --> 00:27:25,999
French identity card's all right.

262
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:29,376
The other one,
I don't think I've seen what they look like...

263
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:30,835
...let alone copy it.

264
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:34,547
I'll get a colleague in France to pick
a pocket so I can make a duplicate.

265
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:39,469
Give me more time, more money.

266
00:27:40,347 --> 00:27:41,848
How much more?

267
00:27:42,224 --> 00:27:43,642
Five hundred.

268
00:27:44,684 --> 00:27:46,352
Three hundred pounds?

269
00:27:48,396 --> 00:27:52,149
-Half now, half on delivery.
-When will I hear from you?

270
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,817
I'll be returning to Genova on August 14.

271
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,782
Be in the same place
where we met tonight at 6:00.

272
00:27:58,992 --> 00:28:00,910
Must be a big job you've got.

273
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:03,329
There are certain things
I wish to make clear.

274
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:05,664
When you've finished,
I want the negatives...

275
00:28:05,747 --> 00:28:08,500
...and all the prints
of the photographs you've taken.

276
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:10,918
You will also forget the name Duggan...

277
00:28:11,002 --> 00:28:14,134
...and the name on the French
documents you're going to produce.

278
00:28:14,217 --> 00:28:16,094
Is that understood?

279
00:30:45,672 --> 00:30:48,674
Taking it easy? I wish I had your job.

280
00:30:48,924 --> 00:30:52,302
All my tenants are on holiday.
What time is it?

281
00:30:52,761 --> 00:30:55,138
-Half past 5:00.
-I must hurry.

282
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:57,139
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.

283
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:57,226
That's him. See?

284
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:00,734
In the light coat.
He's the official at the lyse Palace.

285
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:06,405
He'll pack his wife and children off
to the Loire Valley for the holiday.

286
00:33:06,489 --> 00:33:08,658
You haven't got much time.

287
00:33:10,951 --> 00:33:12,452
I need Wolenski.

288
00:33:12,535 --> 00:33:15,121
Arrange to get him across the border.

289
00:33:15,455 --> 00:33:19,212
What? Never mind the Italian government.

290
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:22,880
Once you have him inside France,
bring him to Paris immediately.

291
00:34:13,936 --> 00:34:16,564
You're being very foolish, Viktor.

292
00:34:19,107 --> 00:34:22,110
You know yourself,
they always talk in the end.

293
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:26,659
You've seen it with your own two eyes
in Indochina.

294
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,040
And in Algeria, of course.

295
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:38,502
Tell us what they're waiting for
in that hotel!

296
00:34:48,181 --> 00:34:51,726
What are they planning?
Who have they been meeting with?

297
00:34:53,185 --> 00:34:56,192
Nobody? Not a soul?

298
00:34:59,153 --> 00:35:02,238
Then where were they
before they went to Rome?

299
00:35:05,741 --> 00:35:07,826
Tell us, Viktor.

300
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,838
Go back a bit.

301
00:35:18,756 --> 00:35:20,841
Hold it. Stop.

302
00:35:23,344 --> 00:35:24,512
Question:

303
00:35:25,012 --> 00:35:28,097
Rome, Viktor. Why did they go to Rome?

304
00:35:28,722 --> 00:35:30,603
-No answer.
-Check.

305
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:33,315
Question: why are they in Rome?

306
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,317
-Answer: secret.
-Check.

307
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:40,529
Question: where did they stay
in Vienna, Viktor?

308
00:35:40,987 --> 00:35:42,905
-No answer.
-Check.

309
00:35:43,197 --> 00:35:44,865
Was it the house?

310
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,373
I am asking you, was it a house?

311
00:35:49,624 --> 00:35:50,874
Answer:

312
00:35:54,294 --> 00:35:55,921
Kleist.

313
00:36:00,299 --> 00:36:01,426
Go on.

314
00:36:03,723 --> 00:36:06,391
Question: who is Kleist?

315
00:36:07,434 --> 00:36:08,976
What does he do?

316
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,567
What did they do to the bastard?
I can't understand a word.

317
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,609
-Put it on the speakers.
-Where from?

318
00:36:17,693 --> 00:36:20,115
"Who is Kleist?" That bit.

319
00:36:23,285 --> 00:36:26,620
Eho is Kleist? Ehat does he do?

320
00:36:37,509 --> 00:36:39,803
Jack? Jackie?

321
00:36:41,013 --> 00:36:43,431
-That wouldn't be Jackie? Would it?
-Jackie?

322
00:36:43,513 --> 00:36:44,931
That's not possible.

323
00:36:45,265 --> 00:36:48,101
Go back, and this time turn up the sound.

324
00:37:12,671 --> 00:37:14,423
Heel, Rex!

325
00:37:15,424 --> 00:37:17,051
Rex, come here!

326
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,940
Are you all right?

327
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:32,024
I think so.

328
00:37:32,108 --> 00:37:34,901
-Do you want me to call for an ambulance?
-No.

329
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,780
Are you sure?

330
00:37:38,531 --> 00:37:40,448
I'll survive.

331
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,373
There. See?

332
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:47,583
I'm sorry.

333
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:49,584
It's not your fault.

334
00:37:53,964 --> 00:37:56,717
-Sorry to drag you away, Colonel.
-Nonsense.

335
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,885
The tape is on your machine
in case you want to refer back...

336
00:37:59,969 --> 00:38:02,434
-...and here is the transcript.
-Yes.

337
00:38:23,122 --> 00:38:24,664
Jackal.

338
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,375
I thought Wolenski used it
as a swear word...

339
00:38:27,459 --> 00:38:29,252
...but it doesn't sound like him.

340
00:38:31,336 --> 00:38:32,755
Fair.

341
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:40,015
Excuse me, Colonel. The foreigner...

342
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:43,018
...could it be a fair foreigner? A blonde?

343
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,774
Is Kleist the foreigner?

344
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:57,408
Colonel, it's 4:30.

345
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:12,549
The plot described above constitutes,
in my view...

346
00:39:13,092 --> 00:39:16,177
...the most dangerous single conception
that the terrorists...

347
00:39:16,677 --> 00:39:18,639
...could possibly have devised...

348
00:39:18,931 --> 00:39:22,392
...to endanger the life
of President De Gaulle.

349
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:26,191
If the plot exists as described...

350
00:39:26,775 --> 00:39:30,568
...and if a foreign-born assassin,
whose code name may be "Jackal"...

351
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:34,280
...has, in fact, been engaged
for this attempt on the life..

352
00:39:34,364 --> 00:39:37,408
-Sorry.
-On the life of the President...

353
00:39:38,868 --> 00:39:42,250
...it is my duty to inform you,
Minister, that in my opinion...

354
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:45,002
...we face a national emergency.

355
00:39:45,586 --> 00:39:47,045
New paragraph.

356
00:39:47,629 --> 00:39:51,258
The above report is top secret
and intended for your eyes only.

357
00:39:51,842 --> 00:39:54,384
Written at 0800 hours...

358
00:39:54,718 --> 00:39:58,179
...August 14, 1963.

359
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:01,604
Address to the Minister of the Interior.

360
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:04,773
Have the dispatch rider stand by...

361
00:40:05,649 --> 00:40:07,900
...and forget everything you've heard.

362
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:11,469
Well?

363
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,639
If what Rolland says is true...

364
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:18,100
...the whole network of our agents
inside the OAS is no good to us.

365
00:41:23,984 --> 00:41:26,070
The President must be told.

366
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:28,613
I'll ask for an interview.

367
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:31,324
Get me the lyse Palace.

368
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:57,895
Minister. One moment, sir.

369
00:42:02,858 --> 00:42:04,484
The Minister of the Interior.

370
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:18,791
There you are.

371
00:42:24,631 --> 00:42:26,548
It's all there.

372
00:42:28,967 --> 00:42:33,309
The Duggan driving license
and French identity card were easy but...

373
00:42:33,975 --> 00:42:36,519
...that third card was a big headache.

374
00:42:36,644 --> 00:42:38,854
It's nicely dog-eared, isn't it?

375
00:42:40,522 --> 00:42:43,149
-Have you forgotten something?
-Sorry?

376
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,867
The original driving license.
The one I said I wanted back.

377
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,911
I thought we might have a chat about that.

378
00:42:57,041 --> 00:43:00,126
The fact is,
the original driving license is not here.

379
00:43:00,293 --> 00:43:03,423
But don't worry.
It's put away in a very safe place.

380
00:43:03,548 --> 00:43:06,135
Nobody can get at it but me.

381
00:43:08,428 --> 00:43:11,014
-What do you want?
-I'm coming to that.

382
00:43:11,181 --> 00:43:13,767
What I propose is simply a little trade.

383
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:16,226
I give you the original driving license...

384
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:18,978
...and all those negatives I took of you...

385
00:43:19,187 --> 00:43:20,943
...for a certain sum of money.

386
00:43:21,026 --> 00:43:23,487
-How much?
-A thousand pounds.

387
00:43:23,654 --> 00:43:27,699
Isn't it worth that
to get those documents back?

388
00:43:29,325 --> 00:43:31,160
Yes, I suppose so.

389
00:43:31,536 --> 00:43:34,746
An English gentleman can always
be trusted to see sense.

390
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:38,713
I can find the first 500 by noon tomorrow,
but we don't meet here.

391
00:43:38,796 --> 00:43:40,754
There's nothing wrong with this place.

392
00:43:40,838 --> 00:43:42,589
It's very quiet and private.

393
00:43:42,673 --> 00:43:45,092
There's everything wrong with this place.

394
00:43:45,175 --> 00:43:49,555
Forget about that. Nobody comes here
unless they're invited by me.

395
00:43:49,638 --> 00:43:53,937
One has to be very discreet,
you know, in my little sideline.

396
00:45:34,546 --> 00:45:36,131
I asked for aluminium.

397
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,134
I tried the aluminium but it just did bend...

398
00:45:40,342 --> 00:45:42,970
...like tissue paper.
I had to use stainless steel.

399
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:46,348
But it's all right. It looks the same.

400
00:45:46,432 --> 00:45:47,848
Where can I practice?

401
00:45:48,725 --> 00:45:52,314
There's the Montemorro Forest.
You could be there and back in a day.

402
00:45:52,565 --> 00:45:54,483
-Excuse me.
-I won't need the case.

403
00:45:55,775 --> 00:45:57,694
Silencer, please.

404
00:46:01,071 --> 00:46:02,489
Strut.

405
00:46:06,075 --> 00:46:08,081
And the sniper scope.

406
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:10,126
Here.

407
00:46:15,504 --> 00:46:16,881
Trigger.

408
00:46:17,423 --> 00:46:19,008
Trigger, please.

409
00:46:37,444 --> 00:46:40,029
-Beautiful piece of work.
-I know.

410
00:46:40,446 --> 00:46:42,619
-It's really excellent.
-Yes.

411
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:48,290
These are for practice.
I took out six of them...

412
00:46:48,665 --> 00:46:50,918
...to convert to explosive tips.

413
00:46:53,629 --> 00:46:55,338
Let me have one.

414
00:47:10,729 --> 00:47:13,566
-Good evening, gentlemen.
-Good evening.

415
00:47:14,025 --> 00:47:15,612
Please sit down.

416
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,032
I trust that you've all read
Colonel Rolland's report?

417
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:24,954
I delivered a copy
to the President this afternoon.

418
00:47:25,788 --> 00:47:29,081
Unhappily, in the interest
of the dignity of France...

419
00:47:29,164 --> 00:47:32,506
...he feels obliged to impose
enormous limitations on us.

420
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,426
He refuses to alter in any way...

421
00:47:35,592 --> 00:47:38,302
...the summer schedule
of his public appearances.

422
00:47:38,386 --> 00:47:39,721
Good heavens.

423
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:43,348
The search for this Jackal
will be conducted in absolute secrecy.

424
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:47,268
Needless to say,
you are all sworn to total silence...

425
00:47:47,351 --> 00:47:50,024
...and won't discuss this matter
outside this room.

426
00:47:50,108 --> 00:47:51,568
But Minister--

427
00:47:53,194 --> 00:47:54,695
But it's impossible!

428
00:47:54,778 --> 00:47:57,531
The President was absolutely adamant.

429
00:47:58,157 --> 00:48:01,701
What extra security precautions
do we take, Minister?

430
00:48:01,868 --> 00:48:03,202
None.

431
00:48:04,287 --> 00:48:07,084
General Colbert. Any success in Vienna?

432
00:48:07,168 --> 00:48:11,588
Inquiries were made by our agents
at the Pension Kleist.

433
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:16,010
They showed photographs of Rodin,
Montclair and Casson to the desk clerk.

434
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:20,471
Some money changed hands.
He stated that he recognized them.

435
00:48:20,554 --> 00:48:22,935
They had arrived on June 14.

436
00:48:24,228 --> 00:48:25,730
Were there any visitors?

437
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:28,356
One man the next afternoon.

438
00:48:28,607 --> 00:48:31,026
He left half an hour later.

439
00:48:31,484 --> 00:48:36,030
The only description the clerk could give
was the man was well-groomed...

440
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:38,449
...in his early thirties and had fair hair.

441
00:48:39,953 --> 00:48:42,414
Surely a better description can be found.

442
00:48:42,498 --> 00:48:43,914
From whom?

443
00:48:47,084 --> 00:48:48,627
Rodin, for instance.

444
00:48:49,961 --> 00:48:54,216
I hardly think he'd accept an invitation
from any of our departments, Colonel.

445
00:48:59,765 --> 00:49:02,893
Commissioner Berthier, any suggestions?

446
00:49:03,894 --> 00:49:05,813
We're in trouble on this one.

447
00:49:06,021 --> 00:49:08,398
Our agents inside the OAS
can't pin him down...

448
00:49:08,481 --> 00:49:11,024
...since not even the OAS know who he is.

449
00:49:11,108 --> 00:49:14,281
Action Service can't destroy him.
They don't know who to destroy.

450
00:49:14,366 --> 00:49:18,661
Surveillance can't get him at the border,
they don't know what he looks like.

451
00:49:18,744 --> 00:49:21,705
The gendarmes, all 48,000 of them,
can't pursue him.

452
00:49:21,788 --> 00:49:23,581
They don't know who to pursue.

453
00:49:23,665 --> 00:49:27,292
The police can't arrest him.
We don't know who to arrest.

454
00:49:28,585 --> 00:49:31,676
Without a name,
all other proposals are meaningless.

455
00:49:31,801 --> 00:49:33,802
The first task, then, is to find it.

456
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:37,139
With a name, we get a passport and a face.

457
00:49:37,264 --> 00:49:39,766
With a face, we get an arrest.

458
00:49:40,684 --> 00:49:44,228
But to find his name,
and to do it in secret...

459
00:49:44,311 --> 00:49:46,568
...is a job of pure detective work.

460
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:50,403
Commissioner,
who is the best detective on the force?

461
00:49:53,197 --> 00:49:54,574
The best detective...

462
00:49:54,782 --> 00:49:58,036
...is my own deputy commissioner,
Claude Lebel.

463
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:04,753
Claude!

464
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,091
Berthier wants to see you.

465
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,093
-What? Now?
-He's sent a car.

466
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:19,352
Don't be back later than 9:00.

467
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,245
Commissioner Lebel.

468
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:42,626
Good evening.

469
00:50:44,669 --> 00:50:47,798
Remember, you have full powers
in this investigation...

470
00:50:47,923 --> 00:50:52,133
...and the resources of every department
represented here entirely at your disposal.

471
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:55,933
My instructions are simply:
no publicity and do not fail.

472
00:50:57,016 --> 00:50:58,977
Keep your copy of the report.

473
00:50:59,895 --> 00:51:01,230
Any questions?

474
00:51:01,939 --> 00:51:03,189
No, Minister.

475
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:05,732
In that case, I'll not detain you.

476
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:09,698
Thank you, Commissioner.

477
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:19,040
Collect the reports
and put them in my private safe.

478
00:51:19,124 --> 00:51:20,583
-Yes, Minister.
-Good night.

479
00:51:20,667 --> 00:51:22,793
-Good night.
-Thank you.

480
00:51:37,434 --> 00:51:40,019
You'll have to drop whatever you're doing.

481
00:51:40,145 --> 00:51:41,728
Clear the desk completely.

482
00:51:41,812 --> 00:51:43,943
-You want a new office?
-No.

483
00:51:44,444 --> 00:51:47,738
From now on, it's headquarters for this job,
nothing else.

484
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:50,991
The Minister said
he wants a progress report by you...

485
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:53,034
...every evening from now on.

486
00:51:53,409 --> 00:51:56,119
-Here. 10:00 sharp.
-Oh, God.

487
00:51:56,286 --> 00:51:57,537
I know.

488
00:51:57,787 --> 00:52:01,337
You've just got to find him
before he gets to De Gaulle.

489
00:52:01,463 --> 00:52:04,673
-I wonder if he has a timetable.
-I'm sure he has.

490
00:52:04,757 --> 00:52:06,549
The trouble is, only he knows it.

491
00:52:06,632 --> 00:52:09,886
He might go for a hit tomorrow
or maybe not for a month.

492
00:52:10,136 --> 00:52:12,721
You've got to work flat out
until you locate him.

493
00:52:12,804 --> 00:52:16,391
After that, we can have Action Service
do the rest, the thugs.

494
00:52:16,683 --> 00:52:20,316
Obviously, you've got to have
a heavy mug for a thing like this.

495
00:52:21,149 --> 00:52:24,903
Anyway, just go and find this Jackal,
will you?

496
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:27,947
What?

497
00:52:29,615 --> 00:52:31,783
-I'll need help.
-Who?

498
00:52:31,991 --> 00:52:34,372
Young Caron, and he'll have to be told.

499
00:52:34,748 --> 00:52:39,168
-I'll have to get clearance.
-All I want is Caron. That's all.

500
00:52:45,424 --> 00:52:49,094
You know, sir, what they'll do to you
if you don't catch him in time.

501
00:52:49,844 --> 00:52:52,600
I've been given a job,
so we'll just have to do it.

502
00:52:52,683 --> 00:52:54,601
But no crime has been committed yet.

503
00:52:54,684 --> 00:52:57,561
Where are we supposed to start looking
for the criminal?

504
00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:00,231
We start by recognizing that,
after De Gaulle...

505
00:53:00,314 --> 00:53:02,776
...we are the two most
powerful people in France.

506
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:04,443
Now make notes.

507
00:53:05,486 --> 00:53:08,284
Get my secretary transferred
until further notice.

508
00:53:08,368 --> 00:53:11,661
You will be my secretary
and assistant rolled into one.

509
00:53:11,994 --> 00:53:15,373
I want a camp bed in here
with linen and all the usual...

510
00:53:15,498 --> 00:53:18,584
...including something to wash in
and shaving things.

511
00:53:18,918 --> 00:53:21,170
Also, get a percolator and lots of coffee.

512
00:53:21,254 --> 00:53:23,713
-Right, sir.
-Get onto the switchboard.

513
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:27,138
I want a good telephonist,
the best they've got.

514
00:53:27,221 --> 00:53:30,306
I need ten outside lines
open around-the-clock.

515
00:53:30,557 --> 00:53:32,976
If there's any nonsense,
refer them to Berthier.

516
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:35,227
This job gets top priority at all times.

517
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:37,437
Do you want anything
from them immediately?

518
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,480
A person-to-person link to the heads...

519
00:53:39,564 --> 00:53:42,363
...of the homicide divisions
of the following countries:

520
00:53:42,447 --> 00:53:45,866
Holland, Belgium, Italy, West Germany...

521
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:48,075
...and South Africa.

522
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,910
The FBI in the United States...

523
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:52,496
...and Scotland Yard's
Special Branch in Britain.

524
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:55,081
-How many is that?
-Seven.

525
00:53:55,248 --> 00:53:57,713
Get the head man at home or in the office.

526
00:53:57,796 --> 00:54:00,381
Ask them to take a call from me
tomorrow morning...

527
00:54:00,465 --> 00:54:02,717
...and see that there's no one listening in.

528
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,470
In the meantime,
I'm going down to General Records...

529
00:54:05,553 --> 00:54:08,639
...to check if this Jackal
has ever operated inside France.

530
00:54:08,848 --> 00:54:12,933
Sir, how do you know the Jackal
comes from any of these countries?

531
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,438
I don't.

532
00:54:15,063 --> 00:54:17,649
But he must be on file somewhere.

533
00:54:37,003 --> 00:54:41,006
-Sorry I'm late, darling.
-What kept you so long?

534
00:54:41,131 --> 00:54:44,968
-There was a long meeting.
-I've been waiting for hours.

535
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:48,643
Yes, I'm sorry about the hour, but....

536
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:53,062
Yes, Washington, I know it's 7:00 there.
It's midnight here.

537
00:54:54,522 --> 00:54:55,523
What?

538
00:54:57,108 --> 00:54:59,860
Could you call him at the club, please?

539
00:55:01,236 --> 00:55:02,612
I didn't go out.

540
00:55:02,862 --> 00:55:05,119
I just sat waiting for you to call.

541
00:55:05,202 --> 00:55:07,454
It was impossible. There was a crisis on.

542
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:10,039
Crisis? What crisis?

543
00:55:10,665 --> 00:55:12,083
Never mind.

544
00:55:18,212 --> 00:55:20,673
-What crisis?
-It was nothing.

545
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:24,264
What crisis?

546
00:55:29,351 --> 00:55:30,644
Mr. Mallinson.

547
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:35,273
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.
It's Paris calling, Inspector Caron.

548
00:55:35,356 --> 00:55:38,112
I don't wish to sound rude,
but wouldn't it be better...

549
00:55:38,195 --> 00:55:41,990
...if routine inquiries could be conducted
through proper channels?

550
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,949
Preferably when we're all awake?

551
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:48,538
I'm sorry, Mr. Mallinson. It is very urgent.

552
00:55:48,705 --> 00:55:51,457
Commissioner Lebel didn't wish
to make a formal request.

553
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,375
He was hoping
that you'd cooperate with us unofficially.

554
00:55:54,834 --> 00:55:58,675
All right.
I'll take the Commissioner's call at 8:30.

555
00:55:59,175 --> 00:56:01,135
Fine. Good night.

556
00:56:02,803 --> 00:56:04,221
What's left of it.

557
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:07,349
-Who was that?
-The old boy network.

558
00:57:00,823 --> 00:57:01,949
Yes?

559
00:57:02,327 --> 00:57:04,621
-Denise.
-Valmy here.

560
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,164
They found out about the Jackal.

561
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:15,547
All I found in Central Records was that
in the 10 last years there've only been...

562
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:17,757
...four contract killers in France.

563
00:57:17,841 --> 00:57:21,765
We've got three. The fourth is
serving time in Africa somewhere.

564
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:24,307
So, our man must be from abroad.

565
00:57:24,558 --> 00:57:27,686
Surely he's come to someone's attention
somewhere.

566
00:57:29,814 --> 00:57:32,482
-Who do I speak to first?
-Scotland Yard...

567
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:34,817
...Special Branch.

568
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:37,532
Assistant Commissioner Mallinson.

569
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:42,619
There's no name.
Nothing to go on, I'm afraid.

570
00:57:45,747 --> 00:57:49,292
It's pretty irregular,
all this unofficial secrecy, isn't it?

571
00:57:49,417 --> 00:57:51,127
Makes my task difficult.

572
00:57:51,544 --> 00:57:52,883
Yes, I know.

573
00:57:54,134 --> 00:57:57,344
I've never heard of a political killer
in this country.

574
00:57:57,553 --> 00:58:01,306
-It's not our style, is it?
-No, it's more your department...

575
00:58:01,931 --> 00:58:04,100
-...so, I'll leave it in your hands.
-Yes--

576
00:58:04,184 --> 00:58:06,852
And try to get it out of the way
by tomorrow.

577
00:58:07,102 --> 00:58:08,937
I'm understaffed as it is.

578
00:58:09,526 --> 00:58:11,236
Yes, sir.

579
00:58:15,614 --> 00:58:17,240
What's the cost?

580
01:01:34,744 --> 01:01:37,372
Give me the Foreign Office,
would you, please, luv?

581
01:01:37,456 --> 01:01:39,249
Extension 905.

582
01:01:45,004 --> 01:01:46,297
Hello, Barrie?

583
01:01:47,047 --> 01:01:48,302
Brian Thomas.

584
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:51,721
Could you meet me in an hour
at the usual place?

585
01:01:58,896 --> 01:02:01,855
We've been plowing through the files
till we're cross-eyed.

586
01:02:01,938 --> 01:02:03,899
None of them fits the description.

587
01:02:03,982 --> 01:02:06,155
But before we drop it, I had a thought.

588
01:02:06,447 --> 01:02:08,907
If this contract killer
did all his work abroad...

589
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:11,367
...he'd be quite respectable
in England, right?

590
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:12,243
So?

591
01:02:12,535 --> 01:02:16,872
Your people operate abroad. I thought
you might have tabs on a bloke like that.

592
01:02:16,955 --> 01:02:18,874
I'll have a look.

593
01:02:20,963 --> 01:02:22,840
Brian, call for you.

594
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:31,013
Thomas.

595
01:02:31,555 --> 01:02:33,015
Yes, that's right.

596
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,773
Is this some sort of bloody joke?

597
01:02:40,066 --> 01:02:41,651
What, now?

598
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,069
Personally?

599
01:02:45,195 --> 01:02:46,863
Yes, I'll--

600
01:03:10,971 --> 01:03:13,644
-The Prime Minister?
-The Prime Minister, sir.

601
01:03:13,894 --> 01:03:18,064
He said, "If there's the remotest chance
of De Gaulle's life being threatened...

602
01:03:18,148 --> 01:03:21,442
...by a person of these islands,
then it is to be stopped."

603
01:03:21,526 --> 01:03:24,361
He's given me full powers and top priority.

604
01:03:24,903 --> 01:03:27,322
-Is this some kind of joke?
-Of course not, sir.

605
01:03:27,406 --> 01:03:29,619
I've got to drop whatever I'm doing.

606
01:03:29,703 --> 01:03:32,663
I shall need six of your best men
straight away.

607
01:03:34,331 --> 01:03:37,960
Where's the notification for this?
Where's the proper authority?

608
01:03:39,504 --> 01:03:40,754
Yes!

609
01:03:45,637 --> 01:03:47,764
Yes, sir. Of course, sir.

610
01:03:54,686 --> 01:03:58,314
Nothing more than taproom gossip,
I'm afraid.

611
01:03:58,857 --> 01:04:00,692
Do you remember Trujillo?

612
01:04:01,654 --> 01:04:04,866
You mean the dictator
of some republic in South America?

613
01:04:04,991 --> 01:04:07,742
Yes, Dominica. He was killed in 1961.

614
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:12,038
We got word that an Englishman
may have been mixed up in it.

615
01:04:12,413 --> 01:04:14,748
Just an unconfirmed report, mind you.

616
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:18,464
-Did he have a name?
-Charles Harold Calthrop.

617
01:04:18,923 --> 01:04:22,634
He was the Caribbean rep
for a small armaments firm.

618
01:04:23,176 --> 01:04:26,513
According to the rumor,
he was a fantastic shot.

619
01:04:27,514 --> 01:04:29,974
He disappeared after the assassination.

620
01:04:30,475 --> 01:04:32,266
Nobody knows where he went.

621
01:04:33,226 --> 01:04:34,310
Calthrop.

622
01:04:34,435 --> 01:04:37,025
-Is that all there is to go on?
-Afraid so.

623
01:04:37,609 --> 01:04:38,944
Just a name?

624
01:04:41,863 --> 01:04:43,907
What makes you think it might be him?

625
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:47,326
Your friend's code name is "Jackal", right?

626
01:04:47,742 --> 01:04:49,369
Jackal in French is...

627
01:04:49,828 --> 01:04:52,584
..."chacal."

628
01:04:53,252 --> 01:04:54,128
See?

629
01:04:54,294 --> 01:04:56,462
Now it might just be a coincidence...

630
01:04:56,546 --> 01:04:59,840
...but the first three letters
of his Christian name, Charles...

631
01:04:59,923 --> 01:05:03,594
...and the first three letters
of Calthrop make up....

632
01:05:18,735 --> 01:05:22,030
That's all the Charles H. Calthrop,
way back to 1958.

633
01:05:22,197 --> 01:05:24,115
-How many does that make?
-23.

634
01:05:28,372 --> 01:05:30,582
Will you please tell Commissioner Lebel...

635
01:05:30,665 --> 01:05:33,668
...that there is a faint possibility,
very faint...

636
01:05:34,043 --> 01:05:37,463
...the name is Charles Harold Calthrop.

637
01:05:38,421 --> 01:05:41,132
That's right.
We've checked with the Passport Office.

638
01:05:41,215 --> 01:05:44,140
23 passports were issued
to Charles H. Calthrop...

639
01:05:44,348 --> 01:05:46,350
...during the past five years.

640
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,934
We've interviewed 12 of them so far.

641
01:05:49,894 --> 01:05:52,646
Nothing at all, but I'll keep you posted.

642
01:05:53,147 --> 01:05:55,148
Do you have a garage for rent?

643
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,107
Excuse me.

644
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:53,067
Would you happen to know
where Mr. Charles Calthrop is?

645
01:07:53,151 --> 01:07:54,526
-Mr. Calthrop?
-Yes.

646
01:07:54,985 --> 01:07:57,867
I think he's abroad. He often is, you know.

647
01:07:58,743 --> 01:07:59,827
Thank you.

648
01:08:00,411 --> 01:08:02,454
We better get a search warrant.

649
01:08:19,055 --> 01:08:20,639
What's happening?

650
01:08:29,356 --> 01:08:30,528
Come in.

651
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:36,156
We've been through the lot, sir.
He's away, all right.

652
01:08:37,825 --> 01:08:39,618
Let's see what you've got.

653
01:08:58,972 --> 01:09:01,056
-What's this?
-His passport.

654
01:09:01,932 --> 01:09:03,688
We checked it. It's him.

655
01:09:03,896 --> 01:09:06,649
Look. The Dominican visa.

656
01:09:07,401 --> 01:09:10,944
There's no exit stamp though.
He must have got out on the sly.

657
01:09:11,903 --> 01:09:14,406
You haven't grasped it yet, have you?

658
01:09:14,698 --> 01:09:17,408
Yes, this is our man, all right. Definitely.

659
01:09:17,491 --> 01:09:21,040
But hasn't it occurred to you
that we're holding his passport?

660
01:09:21,708 --> 01:09:25,042
If he is out of the country,
what's he traveling on?

661
01:09:26,752 --> 01:09:29,673
-He might be on holiday in the UK.
-Yes, he might.

662
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:31,550
Then again, he might not.

663
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:35,719
His name is Charles Harold Calthrop.
Here's his passport photo.

664
01:09:38,266 --> 01:09:41,436
I'll circulate photos
to each of you after the meeting.

665
01:09:42,019 --> 01:09:43,145
Excellent.

666
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:45,856
Thank you, Commissioner.

667
01:09:47,982 --> 01:09:53,154
It may be Calthrop has already entered
the country and is staying at a hotel.

668
01:09:53,237 --> 01:09:54,534
-Phillison.
-Minister?

669
01:09:54,618 --> 01:09:58,205
I want every hotel card for the past
72 hours checked by the police.

670
01:09:58,287 --> 01:10:02,582
The same for you, Pascal, with those cards
that are filed for the greater Paris area.

671
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:05,877
Circulate to your staffs
this man's name and photograph.

672
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:09,923
He must be arrested on sight,
and my office notified at once.

673
01:10:10,548 --> 01:10:12,179
I want every border post...

674
01:10:12,262 --> 01:10:15,222
...airport, seaport, fishing village alerted.

675
01:10:15,972 --> 01:10:18,183
-General Colbert.
-Minister?

676
01:10:18,558 --> 01:10:22,103
Calthrop is probably still abroad,
so get your agents working on that.

677
01:10:22,187 --> 01:10:23,021
Yes, sir.

678
01:10:23,271 --> 01:10:25,980
In the meantime,
complete silence must be maintained...

679
01:10:26,064 --> 01:10:28,737
...until we're sure
the man's in this country.

680
01:10:28,821 --> 01:10:31,824
-Thank you. Good night.
-Good night.

681
01:10:40,413 --> 01:10:42,332
Commissioner Lebel's office.

682
01:10:44,463 --> 01:10:45,714
Yes.

683
01:10:50,511 --> 01:10:52,470
Thank you. Good-bye.

684
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:58,934
No one called Calthrop has crossed
any border point legally...

685
01:10:59,017 --> 01:11:00,936
...since the start of the year.

686
01:11:01,019 --> 01:11:03,816
And no hotel has taken in a guest
under that name.

687
01:11:03,899 --> 01:11:06,401
Maybe he's given up and gone into hiding.

688
01:11:07,986 --> 01:11:10,698
If the British found
Calthrop's passport in his flat...

689
01:11:10,781 --> 01:11:13,200
...it's because he no longer needed it.

690
01:11:14,075 --> 01:11:16,535
Don't count on that man
making too many errors.

691
01:11:16,618 --> 01:11:18,207
He's not the type.

692
01:11:21,002 --> 01:11:23,712
I'm beginning to get
a feeling about the Jackal.

693
01:11:25,338 --> 01:11:28,258
He may be abroad,
traveling on a false passport.

694
01:11:29,216 --> 01:11:32,761
What you're going to do now is
go down to the Passport Office.

695
01:11:33,095 --> 01:11:36,769
Get every passport application
for the last three months.

696
01:11:36,853 --> 01:11:39,104
-But, sir--
-I don't care who's closed.

697
01:11:39,188 --> 01:11:40,731
Wake the buggers up.

698
01:11:41,355 --> 01:11:44,358
Then take all those papers
down to Somerset House...

699
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:47,153
...get started on checking
the applicants' names...

700
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:50,363
...against death certificates,
not birth certificates.

701
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:54,497
If you find an application filed by someone
who died as a child...

702
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:57,123
...the one who filed it might be our man.

703
01:11:58,082 --> 01:12:01,127
If you find nothing
in the first three months, go back three.

704
01:12:01,211 --> 01:12:03,087
And another three if you have to.

705
01:12:03,171 --> 01:12:04,588
Off you go.

706
01:12:42,924 --> 01:12:43,925
Yes?

707
01:12:44,425 --> 01:12:46,092
How's it going, Hughes?

708
01:12:48,135 --> 01:12:49,762
How many applications?

709
01:12:50,555 --> 01:12:52,598
8,041?

710
01:12:53,349 --> 01:12:55,059
You'll be there a week.

711
01:12:55,434 --> 01:12:57,769
How about I send you some more staff?

712
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:01,902
Bloody holiday season.

713
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:12,869
About 4,000 more to go, Mr. Thomas.

714
01:13:13,953 --> 01:13:17,420
But if we work through lunch,
we should be finished tonight. Thank you sir!

715
01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:00,685
Superintendent Thomas, Special Branch.

716
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:03,937
Hughes here, sir.

717
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,694
Paul Oliver Duggan.

718
01:14:06,777 --> 01:14:10,494
Born April 3, 1929, in Sambourne Fishley.

719
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:12,782
Applied for passport July 14 of this year.

720
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:16,384
Passport mailed July 17
to an address in Paddington.

721
01:14:16,684 --> 01:14:20,062
That will probably turn out
to be an accommodation address.

722
01:14:20,307 --> 01:14:21,308
Why?

723
01:14:21,517 --> 01:14:26,899
Because Duggan died at the age
of two and a half on November 8, 1931.

724
01:15:02,021 --> 01:15:03,605
Passport, please.

725
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,609
One moment.

726
01:15:17,912 --> 01:15:20,165
-Mr. Duggan?
-Yes?

727
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:24,711
What's the purpose of your visit to France?

728
01:15:25,752 --> 01:15:26,795
Tourism.

729
01:15:41,313 --> 01:15:43,688
-You buy this in Italy?
-No, it's hired.

730
01:15:44,022 --> 01:15:46,945
I shall be returning it to Genova
in about a week.

731
01:15:47,112 --> 01:15:48,405
Papers, please.

732
01:15:52,116 --> 01:15:53,618
Got any luggage?

733
01:15:55,076 --> 01:15:57,496
-In the boot.
-Bring it inside.

734
01:16:36,832 --> 01:16:37,999
Thank you.

735
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:09,573
Once we've found his new name,
Lebel shouldn't have trouble catching him.

736
01:17:09,656 --> 01:17:11,161
It's not that simple.

737
01:17:11,244 --> 01:17:14,788
There are over two million foreigners
are in Paris at this time of year.

738
01:17:14,872 --> 01:17:16,832
I'm very sorry, Minister.

739
01:17:19,585 --> 01:17:21,921
Commissioner Lebel
requested this meeting...

740
01:17:22,005 --> 01:17:25,298
...because he has new information
on the British suspect.

741
01:17:26,883 --> 01:17:29,306
Calthrop is traveling on a false passport...

742
01:17:29,389 --> 01:17:31,765
...in the name of Paul Oliver Duggan.

743
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:36,269
The passport number is 29491.

744
01:17:37,729 --> 01:17:40,147
The photo will reach us in a few hours.

745
01:17:40,439 --> 01:17:42,025
What do we do now?

746
01:17:42,692 --> 01:17:45,324
The Duggan passport
was issued on July 30.

747
01:17:45,407 --> 01:17:47,659
No need to go further back than that.

748
01:17:47,743 --> 01:17:50,327
Special Branch in Britain
is trying to trace him...

749
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:53,371
...through the passenger lists
of all airlines and ferries.

750
01:17:53,663 --> 01:17:56,166
If they pick him up in Britain,
they'll detain him.

751
01:17:56,249 --> 01:17:58,876
If we locate him inside France,
we arrest him.

752
01:17:59,043 --> 01:18:02,883
If he's found in a third country,
Action Service will deal with him.

753
01:18:04,843 --> 01:18:09,764
In the meantime,
I'll be grateful if you would do this my way.

754
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:30,827
-Good morning, sir.
-Paris, please. MOLITOR 5901.

755
01:18:31,077 --> 01:18:32,995
Carrier Number One, please.

756
01:18:48,388 --> 01:18:51,602
The Jackal is blown.
Wolenski talked before dying.

757
01:18:51,853 --> 01:18:53,771
Repeat: the Jackal is blown.

758
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:19,113
Room 14. Thank you, Mr. Duggan.

759
01:21:01,196 --> 01:21:03,240
I'll have coffee in the lounge.

760
01:21:20,301 --> 01:21:22,848
Do you mind my sitting here?

761
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:27,435
Thank you.

762
01:21:38,278 --> 01:21:39,783
Boring, aren't they?

763
01:21:41,035 --> 01:21:42,411
The magazines.

764
01:21:43,828 --> 01:21:46,372
-I find them fascinating.
-What?

765
01:21:47,207 --> 01:21:50,543
Articles on pig breeding
and combine harvesters?

766
01:21:50,919 --> 01:21:53,504
I'm enthralled by combine harvesters.

767
01:21:54,213 --> 01:21:57,011
In fact, I yearn to have one as a pet.

768
01:22:09,063 --> 01:22:10,064
Yes?

769
01:22:11,732 --> 01:22:14,362
When did you say? This afternoon.

770
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:16,738
Repeat that again.

771
01:22:17,405 --> 01:22:21,326
A white Alfa Romeo sports two-seater...

772
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:26,246
...license number GE 1741.

773
01:22:27,789 --> 01:22:31,673
Duggan crossed the border
at Ventimiglia four hours ago.

774
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,550
Call London. Tell them
we'll handle it from now on.

775
01:22:34,633 --> 01:22:36,844
-Where is he?
-How should I know?

776
01:22:37,803 --> 01:22:40,471
Damned secrecy.
We have to wait for the hotel cards.

777
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:44,349
It's madness.
There's nothing we can do about it.

778
01:22:46,564 --> 01:22:49,024
No, of course I don't live in the Alps.

779
01:22:49,108 --> 01:22:51,776
I went there for a visit, that's all.

780
01:22:51,943 --> 01:22:53,820
Climbing?

781
01:22:53,903 --> 01:22:56,489
Good lord, no.

782
01:22:56,865 --> 01:23:00,784
I spent the day at the Cadet Academy
in Barcelonnette...

783
01:23:00,868 --> 01:23:04,499
...amongst a lot
of jaundiced military types...

784
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:07,251
...watching my son receive his commission.

785
01:23:09,712 --> 01:23:11,631
He's nineteen.

786
01:23:13,967 --> 01:23:16,843
I never know when you're being serious.

787
01:23:17,552 --> 01:23:21,393
-It's true, unfortunately.
-Why "unfortunately"?

788
01:23:24,353 --> 01:23:25,938
I see nothing unfortunate..

789
01:23:26,022 --> 01:23:29,357
I'm not begging for compliments,
Mr. Duggan.

790
01:23:33,528 --> 01:23:36,451
-Will you have a liqueur?
-No, I must go to bed.

791
01:23:37,827 --> 01:23:40,288
I have to leave very early
tomorrow morning.

792
01:23:40,371 --> 01:23:42,955
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

793
01:23:45,291 --> 01:23:47,376
Good night, Mr. Duggan.

794
01:26:04,482 --> 01:26:07,401
I've got to leave in a couple of hours.

795
01:26:07,614 --> 01:26:09,866
I've a long way to go.

796
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:12,618
You've got to go back to your room.

797
01:26:12,993 --> 01:26:14,994
Your husband meeting you?

798
01:26:17,498 --> 01:26:19,583
No, he isn't there.

799
01:26:50,199 --> 01:26:51,616
Good morning.

800
01:26:51,908 --> 01:26:54,285
Excuse me, madam.

801
01:26:55,828 --> 01:26:58,085
Only three new guests last night.

802
01:27:02,839 --> 01:27:05,465
All right. Put them in the rack for Nice.

803
01:27:11,179 --> 01:27:13,097
Cards ready yet?

804
01:27:31,241 --> 01:27:33,122
Hello? Nice?

805
01:27:35,333 --> 01:27:37,042
Repeat, please.

806
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:43,465
Stay by the phone until I call back.
Don't do a thing.

807
01:27:43,548 --> 01:27:46,425
I don't want him disturbed yet,
but isolate the place.

808
01:27:46,509 --> 01:27:49,264
Let no one in or out
and stop all phone calls.

809
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:54,101
He's been staying in this hotel near Grasse.

810
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:57,103
-He's registered for two days.
-Shall I put out an alert?

811
01:27:57,187 --> 01:27:59,815
No. He'll kill anybody
who tries to intercept him.

812
01:27:59,899 --> 01:28:01,483
We'd better get there right away.

813
01:28:54,707 --> 01:28:57,171
You have an Englishman
named Duggan staying here.

814
01:28:57,255 --> 01:28:59,298
-Where is he?
-Mr. Duggan's gone, sir.

815
01:28:59,589 --> 01:29:02,426
He left this morning, just after 11:00.

816
01:29:05,179 --> 01:29:08,848
Assemble the staff and guests.
Don't let anyone get away.

817
01:29:08,931 --> 01:29:10,557
Get the manager.

818
01:29:14,314 --> 01:29:16,690
That's strange.
He was booked for two days...

819
01:29:16,773 --> 01:29:20,527
...then just after 11:00,
he suddenly asks for his bill and leaves.

820
01:29:20,611 --> 01:29:24,864
He's got five hours start.
Put out an alert for the car.

821
01:29:43,801 --> 01:29:47,267
But Madame de Montpellier's bed
was slept in by two people?

822
01:29:47,684 --> 01:29:49,519
Yes, sir. Definitely.

823
01:29:49,727 --> 01:29:51,978
You can always tell.

824
01:29:52,145 --> 01:29:54,856
And you saw them in the lounge together?

825
01:29:55,065 --> 01:29:59,193
That is correct, sir.
I served them coffee and liqueur.

826
01:29:59,276 --> 01:30:01,277
They seemed very engrossed.

827
01:30:01,862 --> 01:30:04,577
-In what?
-In each other, sir.

828
01:30:04,702 --> 01:30:07,955
What did Mr. Duggan's luggage
consist of when he left?

829
01:30:08,288 --> 01:30:10,457
-Two bags.
-Nothing else?

830
01:30:10,541 --> 01:30:13,126
No parcels or packages of any kind?

831
01:30:13,210 --> 01:30:16,628
Just the two bags.
I carried them to his car.

832
01:30:16,795 --> 01:30:18,463
That will be all.

833
01:30:18,838 --> 01:30:21,720
-You photographed everything?
-Yes.

834
01:30:22,430 --> 01:30:25,683
Go over his room for fingerprints.
Send the stuff to Paris.

835
01:30:25,766 --> 01:30:28,226
I'll have a talk with the lady.

836
01:30:50,331 --> 01:30:53,713
There's more news.
They have a description of your car.

837
01:30:53,796 --> 01:30:55,882
Keep out of sight for a few days.

838
01:33:14,864 --> 01:33:17,491
-How's the lady?
-Very disturbed by all this.

839
01:33:17,575 --> 01:33:19,493
You told her nothing?

840
01:33:40,347 --> 01:33:43,020
I know nothing at all
about Mr. Duggan's whereabouts.

841
01:33:43,103 --> 01:33:45,188
We only met in the lounge of that hotel.

842
01:33:45,271 --> 01:33:48,483
-He joined me for coffee.
-What did he want?

843
01:33:50,944 --> 01:33:52,779
What did you talk about?

844
01:33:53,071 --> 01:33:55,948
Social chit-chat.
I imagine he was trying to impress me.

845
01:33:56,031 --> 01:33:57,912
Why do you think that?

846
01:33:57,995 --> 01:34:00,915
Commissioner, please, we're not children.

847
01:34:01,622 --> 01:34:03,207
No, madam.

848
01:34:05,084 --> 01:34:08,672
When you both met later,
was it only in your bedroom?

849
01:34:11,590 --> 01:34:15,013
-"Later"?
-Afterwards. After the coffee.

850
01:34:19,517 --> 01:34:23,688
Madam, be in no doubt
as to the seriousness of your position.

851
01:34:41,707 --> 01:34:44,417
We met in my bedroom. That's all.

852
01:34:46,502 --> 01:34:49,633
I'd never seen this man until yesterday.

853
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:52,552
He doesn't even know my real name.

854
01:36:08,507 --> 01:36:12,013
I regret to say
that we have lost track of him.

855
01:36:12,139 --> 01:36:15,142
Temporarily, I hope.
But he simply disappeared.

856
01:36:19,771 --> 01:36:21,814
Could that mean he's changed his mind?

857
01:36:21,897 --> 01:36:23,941
We've obviously scared him off.

858
01:36:24,024 --> 01:36:26,276
Is it possible he's decided to give up?

859
01:36:26,359 --> 01:36:30,367
His only chance to escape
is to get across the border fast.

860
01:36:34,287 --> 01:36:37,039
I think he's still in France.

861
01:36:38,249 --> 01:36:40,167
He may be waiting.

862
01:36:40,543 --> 01:36:42,669
-Waiting for what?
-I don't know.

863
01:36:43,086 --> 01:36:46,092
But I don't think we can assume
that he's given up.

864
01:37:52,664 --> 01:37:53,998
Good morning.

865
01:38:13,394 --> 01:38:15,771
Madam, there is a gentleman--

866
01:38:16,647 --> 01:38:18,148
Surprised?

867
01:38:18,941 --> 01:38:20,484
Thank you, Michel.

868
01:38:23,069 --> 01:38:26,701
-Do that later, Ernestine.
-Yes, madam.

869
01:38:37,128 --> 01:38:39,336
-Yes, I am surprised.
-Why?

870
01:38:39,628 --> 01:38:41,839
Your husband's still away, isn't he?

871
01:38:43,887 --> 01:38:45,805
Why did you come here?

872
01:38:46,055 --> 01:38:47,556
To see you.

873
01:38:48,765 --> 01:38:50,684
I had to.

874
01:38:50,851 --> 01:38:52,184
But why?

875
01:38:55,729 --> 01:38:57,481
Does it matter?

876
01:39:39,487 --> 01:39:43,698
Make a search of hills,
farmhouses, cafes and hotels...

877
01:39:43,782 --> 01:39:47,368
...in a ten-kilometer radius
from the scene of the crash.

878
01:39:47,493 --> 01:39:51,251
Look for a fair-haired,
young foreigner with two suitcases.

879
01:39:51,459 --> 01:39:54,211
He may have been injured
and gone into hiding.

880
01:40:07,394 --> 01:40:10,812
The police were here yesterday
looking for you.

881
01:40:15,275 --> 01:40:17,944
Did they say they were coming back?

882
01:40:20,988 --> 01:40:23,493
Only that I should phone if..

883
01:40:27,580 --> 01:40:31,417
I know you stole that car.
It has a local license plate.

884
01:40:37,462 --> 01:40:40,470
I know it must be very serious.
I don't mind.

885
01:40:40,637 --> 01:40:43,015
You can tell me what you've done.

886
01:40:43,307 --> 01:40:45,473
You can stay here. It's safe.

887
01:40:45,557 --> 01:40:49,019
But you must tell me, Paul.
I won't say anything.

888
01:44:03,522 --> 01:44:05,608
Good-bye, Mr. Duggan.

889
01:44:27,338 --> 01:44:29,507
Your coffee, madam.

890
01:44:57,704 --> 01:44:59,288
Madam?

891
01:45:40,623 --> 01:45:43,797
Good morning.
A single ticket to Paris, please.

892
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:45,966
-What class?
-Second.

893
01:45:47,466 --> 01:45:50,552
-How soon will the train be here?
-In an hour.

894
01:45:51,512 --> 01:45:53,472
Platform One.

895
01:46:12,116 --> 01:46:13,742
Your papers.

896
01:46:21,210 --> 01:46:23,879
-Danish?
-Please?

897
01:46:24,213 --> 01:46:25,881
-Denmark?
-Yes.

898
01:46:26,590 --> 01:46:28,133
What is your business here?

899
01:46:28,341 --> 01:46:30,719
I'm a schoolteacher on holiday.

900
01:47:17,812 --> 01:47:19,021
Madam?

901
01:48:45,072 --> 01:48:48,161
Commissioner, Madame de Montpellier
has been murdered!

902
01:48:48,578 --> 01:48:50,997
-Do they know who did it?
-It sounds like Duggan.

903
01:48:51,079 --> 01:48:54,876
He arrived at her place yesterday,
but disappeared again with her car.

904
01:48:54,959 --> 01:48:58,171
There's no need for secrecy.
It's a straight murder hunt now.

905
01:48:58,253 --> 01:49:01,756
Put out a general alert for Duggan.
Describe the car.

906
01:49:16,648 --> 01:49:20,068
6:30 time check.
Listen, I've found that car.

907
01:49:26,242 --> 01:49:28,954
The gendarmes by the station say
only three men...

908
01:49:29,037 --> 01:49:31,289
...boarded the midday train to Paris.

909
01:49:31,373 --> 01:49:32,666
Two were locals...

910
01:49:32,749 --> 01:49:36,585
...and the third was a teacher
traveling on a Danish passport.

911
01:49:36,669 --> 01:49:41,718
Age: about 34. Five feet ten,
brown hair, blue eyes.

912
01:49:42,052 --> 01:49:43,428
He can't remember the name.

913
01:49:43,637 --> 01:49:47,015
What time is that train due
at Austerlitz station?

914
01:49:47,349 --> 01:49:48,766
Ten past 7:00.

915
01:49:49,975 --> 01:49:51,393
Come on!

916
01:50:33,398 --> 01:50:36,068
-You know a good Turkish bath?
-Of course.

917
01:50:36,152 --> 01:50:37,612
Take me there.

918
01:52:17,385 --> 01:52:21,138
It's obvious that the Jackal
has been tipped off all along.

919
01:52:21,221 --> 01:52:24,349
And yet he's decided to go ahead,
regardless.

920
01:52:24,433 --> 01:52:27,523
He's simply challenged the whole lot of us.

921
01:52:28,149 --> 01:52:31,860
Are you suggesting there's a leak
from inside this room?

922
01:52:34,069 --> 01:52:35,571
I can't say.

923
01:52:35,904 --> 01:52:40,409
We think the Jackal is now in Paris
with a new name and face...

924
01:52:40,492 --> 01:52:43,499
...probably masquerading
as a Danish schoolteacher.

925
01:52:50,338 --> 01:52:51,213
Minister?

926
01:52:51,922 --> 01:52:55,425
Can you estimate how many Danes
might have entered Paris this afternoon?

927
01:52:55,717 --> 01:52:57,844
Several hundred at this time of the year.

928
01:52:57,927 --> 01:52:59,765
We must check on the men personally.

929
01:53:00,016 --> 01:53:03,393
I'll have every hotel visited
at midnight and 3:00 A.M.

930
01:53:03,477 --> 01:53:07,940
All registration cards will be collected.
Every likely Dane will be investigated.

931
01:53:08,023 --> 01:53:08,857
Good.

932
01:53:09,816 --> 01:53:15,278
In the meantime, I'll try to persuade the
President to cancel all public appearances.

933
01:53:58,452 --> 01:54:00,079
You're getting all steamed up.

934
01:54:00,162 --> 01:54:01,621
I think so.

935
01:54:02,872 --> 01:54:06,797
-I haven't seen you here before.
-No, I'm on holiday from Denmark.

936
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:10,091
Really? I know Copenhagen very well.

937
01:54:11,467 --> 01:54:13,886
Unfortunately, I come from Silkeborg.

938
01:54:14,678 --> 01:54:16,638
It's a very small town.

939
01:54:20,558 --> 01:54:23,189
My name is Jules. Jules Bernard.

940
01:54:24,149 --> 01:54:26,151
Lundquist. Per Lundquist.

941
01:54:27,817 --> 01:54:30,403
Perhaps you'd like to come
for a drink at my home?

942
01:54:30,486 --> 01:54:32,363
I live quite nearby.

943
01:54:33,698 --> 01:54:35,616
That would be nice.

944
01:54:40,957 --> 01:54:44,461
So, this Jackal has
a Danish passport, right?

945
01:54:46,838 --> 01:54:49,633
-He must have got it somewhere.
-Yes.

946
01:54:56,012 --> 01:54:59,770
But if he's had to dye his hair,
it looks as if he stole it.

947
01:55:00,686 --> 01:55:01,896
Yes, go on.

948
01:55:03,482 --> 01:55:06,400
Since his trip to Paris in July,
he's been based in London.

949
01:55:06,484 --> 01:55:09,736
The chances are,
he stole it in one of those two places.

950
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:14,578
What would you do if you were a Dane
and lost your passport?

951
01:55:14,662 --> 01:55:16,372
I'd go to the consulate.

952
01:55:17,288 --> 01:55:19,706
-Are you calling Superintendent Thomas?
-Yes.

953
01:55:20,123 --> 01:55:23,210
-Then the Danish Consul in Paris.
-Good.

954
01:55:34,598 --> 01:55:36,809
-How is it going?
-Not well.

955
01:55:37,101 --> 01:55:39,979
678 Danes arrived in Paris yesterday.

956
01:55:40,062 --> 01:55:43,563
We're interviewing every man
about five feet eight.

957
01:55:43,772 --> 01:55:46,821
No Danish schoolteacher
has turned up though.

958
01:55:47,279 --> 01:55:50,740
-Have the list sent to my office.
-Right.

959
01:55:52,075 --> 01:55:53,868
You are quite right, sir.

960
01:55:54,035 --> 01:55:56,829
A Danish schoolteacher
had his passport stolen...

961
01:55:56,912 --> 01:56:00,081
...at London Airport on July 12.

962
01:56:00,164 --> 01:56:04,423
Name: Per Lundquist
of Copenhagen, age 33.

963
01:56:04,506 --> 01:56:09,218
Five feet ten,
chestnut brown hair, blue eyes.

964
01:56:09,343 --> 01:56:12,471
That's it! That's the one! Per Lundquist.

965
01:56:12,555 --> 01:56:15,224
Look him up. Yes?

966
01:56:18,685 --> 01:56:20,982
-There isn't one.
-What?

967
01:56:21,065 --> 01:56:22,984
One moment, Superintendent.

968
01:56:38,752 --> 01:56:40,295
I don't understand it.

969
01:56:40,378 --> 01:56:44,423
There isn't a Lundquist
on the hotels list. Not one.

970
01:56:50,845 --> 01:56:54,895
The following conversation
was recorded at 6:15 this morning.

971
01:56:55,395 --> 01:56:59,564
The number being dialed
was identified as MOLITOR 5901.

972
01:57:04,152 --> 01:57:06,403
-Hello.
-Yes?

973
01:57:07,197 --> 01:57:09,157
-Denise.
-Valmy here.

974
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:11,286
They know he's a Danish schoolteacher.

975
01:57:11,578 --> 01:57:14,206
They're visiting every hotel in Paris.

976
01:57:16,082 --> 01:57:17,917
The contact was arrested an hour ago.

977
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,337
Unfortunately,
the information came from this room.

978
01:57:24,004 --> 01:57:25,714
Whose voice was that?

979
01:57:30,140 --> 01:57:33,101
I regret to have to inform you, Minister...

980
01:57:33,184 --> 01:57:36,145
...that it was the voice of a friend of mine.

981
01:57:36,770 --> 01:57:39,314
She's staying with me at the moment.

982
01:57:42,274 --> 01:57:43,693
Excuse me.

983
01:57:53,455 --> 01:57:56,541
-I feel we owe you an apology.
-Thank you.

984
01:58:00,128 --> 01:58:02,967
I must report that the President
will not change his mind.

985
01:58:03,050 --> 01:58:04,635
Excuse me.

986
01:58:04,760 --> 01:58:08,389
It's occurred to me that we've got
two days to catch the Jackal.

987
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:10,433
What? Why? How do you know?

988
01:58:10,725 --> 01:58:13,185
It was silly of me
not to have seen it before.

989
01:58:13,268 --> 01:58:17,021
Am I right that the President
has no engagements outside the palace...

990
01:58:17,104 --> 01:58:19,652
-...today, tomorrow or Saturday?
-Nothing.

991
01:58:20,361 --> 01:58:22,404
And what is Sunday, August 25?

992
01:58:23,155 --> 01:58:24,906
Of course! Liberation Day!

993
01:58:25,574 --> 01:58:29,036
-That's what he's been waiting for.
-We have a little over 48 hours.

994
01:58:29,119 --> 01:58:31,329
We must have been blind, gentlemen.

995
01:58:31,954 --> 01:58:35,419
All we need is the passport
photograph of Per Lundquist.

996
01:58:35,586 --> 01:58:39,047
Copenhagen promised to send it
by this evening's conference.

997
01:58:42,633 --> 01:58:44,176
There is one thing.

998
01:58:45,344 --> 01:58:47,470
How did you know
whose telephone to tap?

999
01:58:47,553 --> 01:58:49,765
I didn't, so I tapped all of them.

1000
01:59:01,528 --> 01:59:03,113
Are you home already?

1001
01:59:13,584 --> 01:59:16,796
We now have the passport photograph
of Per Lundquist.

1002
01:59:17,421 --> 01:59:19,339
The ban on publicity is off.

1003
01:59:19,589 --> 01:59:21,924
This is now a straight murder hunt.

1004
01:59:22,883 --> 01:59:26,391
Lundquist's photo will appear
in the papers tomorrow morning.

1005
01:59:26,474 --> 01:59:29,393
We'll have news flashes on TV
every 30 minutes.

1006
01:59:29,726 --> 01:59:33,730
Every policeman and CRS man in Paris
will be on the street to check the papers...

1007
01:59:33,814 --> 01:59:36,441
...of anyone remotely
resembling the suspect.

1008
01:59:36,984 --> 01:59:39,068
Every detective will be called to help.

1009
01:59:39,151 --> 01:59:42,158
-How many men does that make?
-Almost 100,000.

1010
01:59:44,994 --> 01:59:46,828
-Commissioner Lebel.
-Yes?

1011
01:59:46,911 --> 01:59:49,872
My congratulations
on the splendid job you've done.

1012
01:59:49,956 --> 01:59:52,209
We shall take over from now on.

1013
01:59:52,876 --> 01:59:56,545
We need detain you no longer.
And, again, thank you.

1014
02:00:39,634 --> 02:00:40,969
Did you see it?

1015
02:00:41,928 --> 02:00:44,930
-What?
-Your face on the TV just now.

1016
02:00:45,765 --> 02:00:48,854
-What do you mean?
-I was passing a TV rental shop...

1017
02:00:48,937 --> 02:00:50,773
...and I saw your face.

1018
02:00:50,898 --> 02:00:52,900
-No.
-Yes.

1019
02:00:56,737 --> 02:00:58,655
Don't turn it off.

1020
02:01:00,907 --> 02:01:03,241
-What was it about?
-I don't know.

1021
02:01:03,325 --> 02:01:05,414
But I swear it was you.

1022
02:01:07,875 --> 02:01:08,751
See?

1023
02:01:15,131 --> 02:01:18,676
We apologize for interrupting
with the following announcement.

1024
02:01:18,759 --> 02:01:22,432
Police still searching for the murderer
of Madame de Montpellier.

1025
02:01:22,516 --> 02:01:26,018
His name is Per Lundquist,
and this is his photograph.

1026
02:01:26,726 --> 02:01:30,647
If you have seen this man,
contact the police immediately.

1027
02:02:08,353 --> 02:02:11,023
For God's sake, wake up, will you?

1028
02:02:11,940 --> 02:02:14,363
The Minister wants to see you!

1029
02:02:36,511 --> 02:02:39,639
We can't find him. He's vanished.

1030
02:02:40,139 --> 02:02:42,682
Just disappeared off the face of the earth.

1031
02:02:44,100 --> 02:02:46,814
I don't think we had any idea
what kind of man...

1032
02:02:46,898 --> 02:02:50,567
-...you have been pursuing.
-What about tomorrow?

1033
02:02:51,610 --> 02:02:54,612
The President rekindles
the eternal flame at 10:00.

1034
02:02:54,820 --> 02:02:56,698
High mass is at 11:00.

1035
02:02:57,741 --> 02:03:00,618
There's only one public ceremony
in the afternoon at 4:00.

1036
02:03:01,577 --> 02:03:05,209
He will present Liberation Medals
to veterans of the Resistance.

1037
02:03:05,501 --> 02:03:07,251
What about crowd control?

1038
02:03:07,377 --> 02:03:11,130
Crowds will be kept back
further than ever before.

1039
02:03:11,589 --> 02:03:14,717
Steel barriers go up several hours
before each ceremony.

1040
02:03:15,009 --> 02:03:18,470
Every house inside the barrier ring
is searched from top to bottom...

1041
02:03:18,553 --> 02:03:20,267
...including the sewers.

1042
02:03:20,851 --> 02:03:24,270
Police will be issued
special lapel badges at the last moment...

1043
02:03:24,354 --> 02:03:27,816
...in case he tries to masquerade
as a security man.

1044
02:03:30,151 --> 02:03:32,443
There'll be marksmen inside Notre Dame...

1045
02:03:32,527 --> 02:03:34,529
...even among the congregation.

1046
02:03:35,697 --> 02:03:39,539
The priests celebrating mass
will be searched for concealed weapons.

1047
02:03:44,041 --> 02:03:48,295
We'll have firemen and marksmen on every
rooftop along the procession route.

1048
02:03:48,379 --> 02:03:51,131
Dumont has drafted
a number of very tall officers...

1049
02:03:51,214 --> 02:03:54,179
...to hedge around the President
without him noticing.

1050
02:11:39,719 --> 02:11:42,555
-Can I pass, please?
-What for?

1051
02:11:42,638 --> 02:11:44,184
I live there.

1052
02:11:44,768 --> 02:11:47,979
I have a room at 154.

1053
02:11:50,189 --> 02:11:51,608
Papers.

1054
02:12:13,839 --> 02:12:15,049
All right.

1055
02:12:15,507 --> 02:12:16,929
Thank you.

1056
02:12:42,746 --> 02:12:44,164
Excuse me, madam.

1057
02:12:44,289 --> 02:12:46,915
Would you be so kind
as to give me a drink of water?

1058
02:12:46,998 --> 02:12:50,085
Of course. Come in. Please come in.

1059
02:12:50,172 --> 02:12:53,593
It's hot, waiting for the ceremony.

1060
02:12:55,344 --> 02:12:57,262
Are you getting a medal today?

1061
02:12:57,346 --> 02:13:00,598
I got mine two years ago with one of my..

1062
02:18:27,411 --> 02:18:28,828
Top floor!

1063
02:19:33,398 --> 02:19:35,525
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1064
02:19:36,151 --> 02:19:38,694
-Who are you?
-Charles Calthrop.

1065
02:19:38,777 --> 02:19:40,487
This is my bloody flat.

1066
02:19:41,363 --> 02:19:43,823
I think you better come down
to the yard, sir.

1067
02:19:43,906 --> 02:19:45,367
Too bloody right, I will.

1068
02:19:49,454 --> 02:19:52,586
There's no question of the British
government ever concealing...

1069
02:19:52,669 --> 02:19:55,337
...that this Jackal was an Englishman.

1070
02:19:55,421 --> 02:19:56,963
So far as one can see...

1071
02:19:57,046 --> 02:20:00,300
...there was a period when
an Englishman came under suspicion...

1072
02:20:00,383 --> 02:20:02,593
...but he has now been cleared.

1073
02:20:03,010 --> 02:20:05,597
Certainly, the Jackal
masqueraded as an Englishman...

1074
02:20:05,680 --> 02:20:09,187
...but he also masqueraded
as a Dane and as a Frenchman.

1075
02:20:09,479 --> 02:20:12,272
So there's no way of proving
his identity at all.

1076
02:20:12,606 --> 02:20:14,816
But if the Jackal wasn't Calthrop...

1077
02:20:14,900 --> 02:20:17,069
...then who the hell was he?
