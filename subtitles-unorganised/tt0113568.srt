1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,230
In the near future, electrons and light flow freely,

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,480
and corporate computer networks eclipse the stars.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,740
Despite great advances in computerization,

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:17,660
countries and races are not yet obsolete...

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,960
All patrolling air units, a 208 is in progress in the C-13 district of Newport City.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,170
Airspace over this area will be closed. Repeat...

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,420
All patrolling air units, a 208 is in progress in the C-13 district of Newport City.

8
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,590
Airspace over this area will be closed. Repeat...

9
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,290
There's no need for concern.

10
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,040
Our country is quite capable of covering it's tracks.

11
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,450
That's why you need me right?

12
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,630
Depends on how you look at it. At any rate

13
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,220
Any program has it's bugs. And I think a man of your capability could cure our problem.

14
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,339
You don't understand.

15
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,759
We're not even sure that Project 2501 really is a bug.

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,350
Originally the purpose of this project was to...

17
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,640
Major Kuzenagi, Section 6 is in position and ready to move in.

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,440
Major! Are you there?

19
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,650
Yeah, I heared you. I'm surprised you can hear anything.

20
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,190
What's with all the noise in your brain today?

21
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,320
Must be a loose wire.

22
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:51,540
Don't you think there's going to be trouble if Section 9 interferes with a Section 6?

23
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:58,339
If Section 6 manages to catch the basterd,
then all they can really do about it is deport him.

24
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,760
Don't forget were Sectio 9, we'll clean it up.
We're the only ones who can get our hands dirty.

25
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,060
It's time. Let's move to the rendezvous point.

26
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,140
What? The police here?

27
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,400
Stop it! Who told you to fire?!

28
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,310
Put your guns down now!

29
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,819
Freeze! Get your hands up!

30
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,030
I'm entitled to diplomatic immunity.

31
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,780
I want to talk to the person in charge here.

32
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,410
Taking classified programmers out of the country compromises national security.

33
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,120
We can also have you brought up on kidnapping charges...

34
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,420
You have no choice, so let him go.

35
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,040
Not possible.

36
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,960
Mr. Daita wants political asylum us, and we have his signed affidavit.

37
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,630
What?

38
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,630
I don't have to explain.

39
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,470
My country has the right, in accordance with international law...

40
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,640
to offer anyone protection and safe passage.

41
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,180
The affidavit is at the embassy.

42
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,060
I'll send you a copy in a couple of days.

43
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,190
Later? You'll be killed if you return.

44
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,230
I'm warning you to watch your comments.

45
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,110
Our country is a peace loving democracy.

46
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,740
Of course it is.

47
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,280
The window! Shoot!

48
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,130
I don't believe it... Thermo-optic camouflage.

49
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,630
Aramaki, what a surprise. So, what business
brings the chief of Section 9 to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?

50
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,220
It's about the secret talks scheduled with the Gavel Republic tomorrow.

51
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,430
Oh, the Official Development Assistance.

52
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,050
The regime that took over Gavel after the revolution
demands financial aid, supposedly for redevelopment.

53
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,890
They boast about democracy, but they're no better than the last lot.

54
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,150
Giving them money, they don't earn, will help nobody.

55
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,810
Now they feel entitled to funds because of our past exploitation. No gratitude.

56
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,940
What's the Ministry going to do?

57
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,900
Well, there's a problem. The leader of the former junta...

58
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,990
that controlled their country is here seeking political asylum.

59
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,870
You mean Colonel Malles, correct?

60
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:26,290
Yes, and that means we either deny Gavel the funds
and treat Malles as a political refuge or help them and kick him out.

61
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,870
It's a tricky situation.

62
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,210
My personal opinion is if we could find a politically acceptable reason...

63
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,880
I'd like to forcibly deport him immediately.

64
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,100
By the way,
I want to thank you for your help with that other political asylum situation.

65
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,900
Nakamura from Section 6 was also grateful.

66
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,360
We diplomats must avoid messy situations, you realize.

67
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,320
Access.

68
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,240
We've lost response.

69
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,870
What's happened to the EEG output?

70
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,080
It's normal. I'll switch to Simex mode.

71
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,250
The Foreign Minister's interpreter.

72
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,760
23 minutes ago, her brain was hacked into through a phone line.

73
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,140
Foreign Intelligence warned us about this.

74
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,970
The "Puppet Master" has begun to infiltrate terminals throughout our network.

75
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:30,560
We believe it's extremely likely that he'll target
the secret talks scheduled with the Republic of Gavel.

76
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,440
We've put everyone attending the talks under surveillance.

77
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:40,070
I suspect once he hacked into her ghost,
he'd use her to assassinate key delegates.

78
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,910
So how long do we have before this hacker breaks
through her barrier program and reaches her ghost?

79
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,370
Roughly 2 hours. He's using an old-fashioned HA-3 virus.

80
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,750
After that, we'll have to break the connection to avoid any danger.

81
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,500
Batou and Ishikawa are tracking the signal source from their car.

82
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,590
Contact them.

83
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,240
That infamous mystery hacker, the Puppet Master, has shown up here?

84
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,950
We guess he or she is American,
but we have no clue about age, sex or background.

85
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,990
Since last winter, he's been popping up in EU countries.

86
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,950
He's wanted for crimes including stock manipulation...

87
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,790
illegal information gathering, political terrorism...

88
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,370
computer ethic infringements...

89
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,630
and is under suspicion for several other crimes.
He's on the international most wanted list.

90
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:42,050
The nickname Puppet Master comes from the ghost hacking.

91
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,970
It's the first time he's appeared in this country.

92
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,430
Well, if he's so skilled how come he's using an outdated HA-3 virus?

93
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,940
A more current technique would be harder to detect and trace...

94
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,900
but it might also arouse suspicion about Colonel Malles role in this affair.

95
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:05,200
Are you saying he's using an old method just so no one suspects Malles?

96
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,540
Or maybe Malles is just a pawn, used to make us think that...

97
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,910
Maybe there is another sponsor.

98
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,170
Now you're stretching it. It's not like you have any hard evidence.

99
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,540
Evidence?

100
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,760
Just a whisper. I hear it in my ghost.

101
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,300
Which reminds me... Are you still using that revolver?

102
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,100
You should stop worrying about the automatics jamming up.

103
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,970
I like my Matever.

104
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:36,230
Stopping power is more important than your taste in guns.

105
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,770
Since it's my ass on the line out there, use a Zastaber.

106
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,320
Major, I want to ask you something.

107
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,780
Why did you transfer a guy like me from the police force?

108
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,080
Because we need a guy like you.

109
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,660
You're an honest cop who's never stepped out of line, and you're a family man.

110
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,750
Except for the slight brain augmentation, your body's almost completely human.

111
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,050
No matter how excellent...

112
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:08,800
identical standard systems have faults.

113
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,810
What's true for the group is also true for the individual.

114
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,850
Overspecialize and you breed in weakness. It's a slow death.

115
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,140
That's all.

116
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,400
Hurry up!

117
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,990
I'll be right there!

118
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,370
We're already 40 seconds late!

119
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,000
I'll be done in 5 seconds.

120
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,710
It's gonna be one of those days.

121
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,930
Hey. Sorry, pal.

122
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:53,100
My last partner who got busted workin'
as an illegal alien, was a lot better than you.

123
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,650
You're that desperate to find out your wife's feelings, you'd ghost-hack her?

124
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:05,150
She hardly talks to me and all of a sudden she wants a divorce!

125
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:10,530
What's worse, my daughter ignores me
and got it into her head that I'm the one cheating on her mom.

126
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,870
How did you get your hands on a barrier breaker?

127
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,870
From this really nice programmer I met in a bar.

128
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:23,670
He overheard my sob story.
My wife's lawyer stopped me seeing her and my daughter.

129
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,710
He showed me how to hack in from
different places along the route, without being traced.

130
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,550
Smart guy, huh?

131
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,890
Are you trying to kill yourself, asshole?!

132
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,850
Looks like we're not the only ones in a hurry round here.

133
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,610
No one here!

134
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,770
What's the point?

135
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,320
Every time we get to the source they're already long gone.

136
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,030
We're just wasting our time, huh?

137
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,240
Quit complaining!

138
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,080
Kusanagi and Togusa are heading
to the next area the hacker's expected to access from. Stay alert.

139
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,120
What are we looking for, Chief?

140
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,120
Anything.

141
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,830
Stupid old fart. Are we just meant to ask around?

142
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,090
Oh, shit...

143
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,130
Damn, I missed him!

144
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,380
Hey, Pop. Did you see the garbage truck?

145
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,930
Who wants to know?

146
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,850
Just answer me. Did you see it or not?

147
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:18,560
Yeah, but they were gone by the time I got my trash.

148
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,350
One was making a call,
so I thought I had enough time to bring my garbage down.

149
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,230
Hey, what about my trash?

150
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,900
A garbage truck?

151
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,450
Clever. It changes location every 7 minutes.

152
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,700
HQ, patch me into info from the Sanitation Department network.

153
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,510
8 trucks are on duty in the surveillance area.

154
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,260
The target is number 79, a type C vehicle.

155
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,100
Let me drive.

156
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,940
Ishikawa, check out the drivers' homes.

157
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,280
Batou, you get to their next stop before they do!

158
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,650
They might have contacted someone.

159
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,200
Follow them, but take no action.

160
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,330
Route data accessed.

161
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,120
Hacking points traced and matched.

162
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,500
The target has now stopped at the next point.

163
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,580
HA-3 access confirmed.

164
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,670
Sorry, sorry.

165
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:37,140
How about if I pick up the trash and you make the calls on the second round?

166
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,350
Alright?

167
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,100
No way I'm gonna be your partner in crime.

168
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,430
It's pathetic.

169
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,190
You got any children?

170
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,980
Do I look like I do?

171
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,150
Then you can't understand.

172
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,440
My daughter is everything to me.

173
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,990
Take a look. Isn't she just a little angel?

174
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,370
I'm not interested in crap like that.

175
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,830
Yeah, vehicle 79. Ah, boss... What's that?

176
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,590
What do the cops want to know our rounds for? How would I know?

177
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,920
I have no idea!

178
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,180
They found out!

179
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,430
I've got to warn that guy who helped me.

180
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,300
We're gonna have to skip the next pickup.

181
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:20,970
What?

182
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,390
Target has deviated from route and is heading toward the next pickup point.

183
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,440
There's no way they spotted me following them.

184
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,150
They probably traced me when I accessed the Sanitation Department network.

185
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,280
Next time, use a back door.

186
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,360
Forget it. Just arrest them.

187
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,450
You can drive now.

188
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,850
Christ... He's fucked up the armored van.

189
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,360
He's got high velocity bullets. They'll go straight through your car door.

190
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,150
HV ammo in a submachine gun? He's insane.

191
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,670
He's even wearing some kind of thermo-optics.

192
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,380
Keep on his tail. I'll come around from above.

193
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,920
Togusa! If you're still alive, arrest those garbage men.

194
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,880
Affirmative.

195
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,850
This job is merciless.

196
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,870
Police! Everyone get down.

197
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,070
Are you finished?

198
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,580
Got him, huh?

199
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:28,170
That's what happens when you use HV bullets.

200
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:32,430
The breach and barrel are really screwed up.

201
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:36,010
It's no use arresting me. I'm not talkin' to any damn cops!

202
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,600
Talk?!

203
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,730
You don't even know your own name, you dickhead.

204
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,650
Can you remember your mother's face, or where you were born?

205
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,240
Do you have any childhood memories?

206
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,030
Do you remember anything?

207
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,540
Puppets without their ghosts are so pathetic.

208
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,420
Especially the kind with red blood running through them.

209
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,400
We'll rush the place after the passengers have gone in.

210
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,190
Squad B comes in from the back. The rest of you go in the front.

211
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,030
Saito, get your men to unplug all cars parked in front of the house.

212
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,280
Begin recording.

213
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,710
Message from HQ, sir.

214
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,210
We've ID'd the man the Major caught.

215
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,500
Go on.

216
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,920
He claims to be Tsuan Gen Fang. Age: 28.

217
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,970
Illegal alien. Weapons violations. Three priors.

218
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:01,810
Was hiding out with a militant refugee group up till a month ago.

219
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:12,070
About a week ago, a military liaison in the Gavel embassy
commissioned him to attack the upcoming secret meeting.

220
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,150
And in reality?

221
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,860
His nickname's Corgi.

222
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,410
Occupation: A rather violent trader in questionable goods.

223
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,490
Your basic thug.

224
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:25,000
We've checked his police records...

225
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,040
but can't find any connection with Gavel.

226
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,130
This guy's just another puppet controlled by the Puppet Master.

227
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,090
How's Ishikawa doing?

228
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:39,590
He's back and interrogating that garbage collector with Togusa.

229
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:45,270
So how about the Puppet Master?

230
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,190
What's he like?

231
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,320
He's like a puppet himself.

232
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,570
Squad B in position.

233
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,150
Squads A and C, ready.

234
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,200
Ready to move in, sir.

235
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,870
Proceed.

236
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,920
What's "a simulated experience" again?

237
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,920
Well, all your memories about your wife, daughter and divorce are false.

238
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,510
Like a dream.

239
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,720
You were used by someone to ghost-hack into some government officials.

240
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,180
But that can't be.

241
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,930
I went to your home...

242
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,770
No one's there. It's a one-room apartment.

243
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,900
I told you. I rented it after we separated.

244
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,900
I checked the records. You've been living there for 10 years.

245
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,860
You've never had a wife or kid.

246
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,740
Your family only exists in your head.

247
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
Look.

248
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,120
This is the photo you showed your co-worker.

249
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,080
Who do you see?

250
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:54,090
It was a picture of my daughter.

251
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,920
Smiling like an angel.

252
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,090
What's her name?

253
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:03,470
Where did you meet your wife and when did you marry her?

254
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,640
Tell me... Who do you see in the photo?

255
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:15,110
If it's all a lie, when will I get my old memory back?

256
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,230
Unfortunately with our current technology...

257
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,570
Only 2 successful cases have ever been reported,
so I wouldn't recommend trying to.

258
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,660
I'm sorry.

259
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,580
Even simulated experiences and dreams...

260
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,160
exist as information, and are simultaneously reality...

261
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,750
and fantasy.

262
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:38,500
The information that people accumulate in their life, is just a drop in bucket.

263
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:12,680
A cyborg who goes diving in her spare time. That can't be a good sign.

264
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,180
How long have you been doing it?

265
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,440
Aren't you afraid of the sea? What if the floaters don't work?

266
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,280
I suppose I'll die.

267
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,360
Or would you dive in after me?

268
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,790
No one forced you to come out here with me.

269
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,210
I...

270
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,780
So what's it like to swim in the sea?

271
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,700
You've done the underwater training course.

272
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,370
I'm not talking about a damn pool.

273
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,290
I feel fear, anxiety, isolation and darkness.

274
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,960
Sometimes I feel hope.

275
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,750
Hope? In those deep, dark waters?

276
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:33,470
When I float back to the surface, I imagine I'm becoming someone else.

277
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,940
Do you want to quit Section 9?

278
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,900
Batou, how much of your body is original?

279
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,450
Are you drunk or something?

280
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,120
Easily remedied.

281
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,080
The chemical implants in our bodies...

282
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,290
can sober us up in seconds. No stupor, no hangover.

283
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:03,130
That's why we can drink here while waiting for orders.

284
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:09,470
Man has an almost instinctive drive
to realize any possible technological advances.

285
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,970
Controlled metabolisms, computer enhanced brains...

286
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,800
Improved reflexes and muscle capacity...

287
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,180
The ability to process vast amounts of information at increasing speeds...

288
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,310
All due to electronic brains and cybernetic bodies,
enabling the acquisition of ever greater powers.

289
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:27,020
So what if we can't survive without regular high-level maintenance.

290
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,030
Who are we to complain?

291
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:33,360
We haven't signed our bodies and souls away to Section 9.

292
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,530
True. We can quit...

293
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:41,460
but we'd have to give back our cyborg parts
and augmented brains to the government.

294
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:46,130
All components that make up me as an individual.

295
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:50,300
There are countless ingredients that make up the human body and mind.

296
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,720
A face and voice to distinguish oneself from others...

297
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,180
The hand you see when you wake up,
your childhood memories and feelings about your future...

298
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,100
And that's not all.

299
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,980
There's also the ability to access
vast amounts of information from an infinite network...

300
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:09,530
All of that blends to create a mixture that forms me,
and gives rise to my conscience.

301
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,860
At the same time though, I feel continually confined within boundaries...

302
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,460
So that's the reason you risk your body diving in the sea?!

303
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,000
What the hell can you see at the bottom in that darkness?

304
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:32,460
Now it's like we're looking through a mirror.

305
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,840
And what we see is a dim image.

306
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,350
Was that you?

307
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,180
Sensors have resumed functioning.

308
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,940
Connection check to backup brain okay.

309
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,810
Visual sensors are back online.

310
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:57,980
And its body functions?

311
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,610
Output is normal.

312
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,700
If you're going to be late, at least let us know!

313
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,790
Preparations complete. Shall we proceed?

314
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,900
That's enough. Stop.

315
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:44,230
Come to my office in 3 minutes.

316
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:53,660
Since you were late, I'll explain what's going on.

317
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,160
About 2 hours ago, a machining cell at the Megatech factory in Newport...

318
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,790
assembled a cyber body on its own volition.

319
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,750
When the supervisors arrived...

320
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,840
the body had already fled.

321
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,970
We put out bulletins and initiated a citywide search.

322
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:15,600
A truck driver reported, he'd run over a naked woman on the highway.

323
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,770
And the body was brought here.

324
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:20,850
Megatech is contracted by the government.

325
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,980
All their cybernetic bodies are classified.

326
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,360
We have a hacker good enough to get past the best defenses...

327
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,280
but that's not the only problem.

328
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:38,160
Of course, there isn't a human brain cell in its head...

329
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:43,460
but there appears to be a ghost present in its auxiliary brain.

330
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,180
It resembles a ghost line that occurs when a real ghost is copied.

331
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,140
But there's no evidence of the degradation that's usually incurred.

332
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:58,310
In any case, until we chart the ghost sector and dive into it...

333
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,730
we can't be sure.

334
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:03,770
I better get back to working on it.

335
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,020
Very good.

336
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,480
On to the disassembly.

337
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:17,740
Nobody really believes there's a ghost in that body, do they?

338
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,660
Why not?

339
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:23,630
Even a plastic doll can have a soul.

340
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:28,250
Consider all the neuro-med devices that are crammed into that body.

341
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,630
I wouldn't be surprised if there was some sort of ghost in there too.

342
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:34,890
As you're new, you don't know...

343
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,890
Major Kusanagi's body was also made by Megatech.

344
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:44,520
Not only her. Also parts of me, Ishikawa, and Saito.

345
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,270
We also receive regular cybernetic maintenance from them.

346
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:51,320
Apart from you and the chief, the whole section comes with a warranty.

347
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,910
That's why we're all so concerned with this case, Togusa.

348
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:02,080
We don't know if the culprit is inside or outside that body, but...

349
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,210
he hacked through our best defenses, put a body together...

350
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,880
and sent a program with a ghost line in it.

351
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,460
A sure way to draw attention to oneself.

352
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,920
What's the logic here?

353
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,090
Theft isn't the issue here.

354
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:19,430
Togusa, go with Ishikawa to the Megatech facility.

355
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,470
Batou.

356
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:24,600
Lock down other highly classified networks similar to Megatech's.

357
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,400
Recheck the barriers are functioning too.

358
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,570
I'm assembling a barrier maze.

359
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,150
Tomorrow I'll dive into that thing.

360
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,650
Is that safe?

361
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,410
Why not contain it in another body first?

362
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,160
I have to see for myself what's in there.

363
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,370
Don't let anyone else dive in there before me!

364
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,630
What's up with her?

365
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:54,800
She's been acting weird ever since this
whole Puppet Master case started. It's all in my report.

366
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,800
Don't you read them?

367
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,810
Chief, do you ever wonder about
the neurosurgeons who monkey around inside your brain?

368
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:07,730
They undergo regular psychiatric evaluations.

369
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:10,860
Especially those in security are subjected to stringent screening.

370
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:14,740
Of course, the ones who check are only human.

371
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,490
If you start wondering, there's no end to it.

372
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:22,120
Excuse me, Chief. Mr. Nakamura of the Treaties Bureau is here to see you.

373
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:23,830
Okay, send him through.

374
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,130
I've seen that fat guy before.

375
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,890
He's Nakamura, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, chief of Section 6.

376
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,810
Never seen the other guy before, though.

377
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,440
Well, see you later.

378
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,610
Tell Ishikawa not to go crazy, okay?

379
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,490
What's on your mind?

380
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:04,330
Didn't that robot remind you of me?

381
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,450
No, it didn't.

382
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,210
I don't mean physically.

383
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:08,750
What then?

384
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:13,090
Maybe all complete cyborgs like me start wondering this.

385
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:17,590
That perhaps I died a long time ago...

386
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:21,930
And I'm a replicant made with a cyborg body and computer brain.

387
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:26,270
Or maybe there never was a real me in the first place.

388
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:29,690
You've got human brain cells in that titanium shell of yours...

389
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:32,440
And you're treated like a human, aren't you?

390
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,570
Has anyone actually seen their own brain?

391
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:40,030
I believe I exist based only on what my environment tells me.

392
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,870
Are you doubting your own ghost?

393
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:45,620
What if a cyber brain could generate its own ghost...

394
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,910
Create a soul by itself?

395
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:51,540
What could you base your belief in yourself on then?

396
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,510
That's bullshit.

397
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:07,600
You know you're dying to see what's inside that thing.

398
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,140
So check it out, with your own ghost!

399
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:13,230
We're both busy men, so let's keep this short, shall we?

400
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,440
Yes. That's my intention.

401
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,820
We've come for the program in that body.

402
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:21,530
You'll be relieved of any duties connected with this.

403
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,910
The Foreign Minister's approval.

404
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:39,510
Security, whose official vehicles are in the basement parking lot?

405
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:44,550
According to the register,
a Mr. Nakamura from the Treaties Bureau and a Dr. Willis, sir.

406
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,470
Get me the video records of their entrance.

407
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,230
Again. In infra-red this time.

408
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,080
One... Two... Three...

409
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:20,380
Now give me the pressure sensors' records for basement parking lots...

410
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:23,010
B7 and B8.

411
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:45,450
Major, this is Togusa. Code 0-9.

412
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,450
What's up?

413
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,780
Does that Nakamura guy have a special order cyborg body?

414
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:53,830
No, there aren't any cyborgs in Section 6 as they operate overseas.

415
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:56,460
Maintenance is difficult and there are diplomatic considerations too.

416
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:59,670
Then even if the other guy is a cyborg...

417
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:02,880
the two of them together couldn't weigh over 1,000 pounds.

418
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,470
The pressure sensors' records. From the parking lot?

419
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:10,180
There were two expensive looking cars,
but neither man looked like the type to drive.

420
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,510
The security cameras show only 2 people.

421
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,480
But remember how sensitive the sensors on the entrance doors are?

422
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,560
The doors took a full 3 second longer than usual to close after the two went in.

423
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:23,150
And it is illegal to use thermo-optics inside governmental facilities.

424
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:26,030
It's a serious violation of the National Security Act.

425
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:29,070
Section 6 must be up to something.

426
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:30,780
Are you ready?

427
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,240
With my trusty Matever, anytime.

428
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,910
I don't need to remind you...

429
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:17,290
It's an act of treason to withhold information from me
that is relevant to this matter regardless of how classified it is.

430
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:18,660
Same goes for you.

431
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,960
Despite the intent of the Foreign Ministry, this falls within Section 9's jurisdiction.

432
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,090
Of course we have no objections to cooperating if there's a good reason.

433
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,590
Dr. Willis?

434
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,140
It's confirmed.

435
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,760
No doubt, it's him.

436
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,060
"Him?"

437
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:40,350
The Doctor is referring to the original ghost line that's now in the body.

438
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:42,690
The sex of the perpetrator is unknown...

439
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:46,030
and "him" is just a nickname the Doctor gave it.

440
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,530
Allow me to introduce to you.

441
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:52,780
This is the most extraordinary hacker in the history of cybercrime.

442
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,370
The Puppet Master.

443
00:46:56,870 --> 00:47:00,250
Your people at Section 9 came across
his work too in that ghost-hacking incident...

444
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,290
involving the Foreign Minister's interpreter.

445
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:07,340
Since his appearance, Section 6 has taken a great interest...

446
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:10,010
and has been following the Puppet Master's trail.

447
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:13,180
We put together a project team headed by Dr. Willis.

448
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:16,220
They analyzed the data on the Puppet Master...

449
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:19,680
This gave us an understanding of his behavioral and code patterns.

450
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:24,060
Ultimately, this enabled us to devise a strategy...

451
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,650
in which we lured his program into a designated body.

452
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:31,110
You caused the Puppet Master to dive into a cyborg...

453
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:33,410
and then murdered his real body?

454
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,370
Yes. That sums it up.

455
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:38,410
He just happened to come to your country.

456
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:42,120
He's originally from America and they helped us capture him.

457
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,170
That's why we'd like to take him back ourselves.

458
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:45,750
I hope you have no objections.

459
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:50,170
Just another unidentified corpse...

460
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,590
You will not find a corpse...

461
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:58,970
because I have never possessed a body.

462
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:00,680
Why are his sensors on?

463
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,100
Why didn't you say so before?

464
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:04,850
All external controls are turned off.

465
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,940
The body's using its own power source.

466
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,820
I entered this body...

467
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:12,490
because I was unable to overcome Section 6's reactive barriers.

468
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:16,110
However, what you are now witnessing is an act of my own free will.

469
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,700
As a sentient lifeform, I hereby demand political asylum.

470
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,250
A sentient lifeform?

471
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:25,210
Ridiculous! It's just a program for self-preservation.

472
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,840
It can also be argued that your DNA...

473
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,590
is nothing more than a program designed to preserve itself.

474
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:38,640
Life is like a nodal point born in an overwhelming sea of information.

475
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:41,010
And life, when organized into species...

476
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,640
relies upon genes to be its memory system.

477
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,600
So man is an individual memory system only because of his intangible memory.

478
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:53,400
And a memory cannot be defined, but it defines mankind.

479
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:58,120
When the advent of computers made the externalization of memories possible...

480
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:02,740
you should have taken its meaning more seriously.

481
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,000
Nonsense!

482
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,750
Your babbling offers no proof at all that you're a living, thinking lifeform.

483
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:11,550
Proving it is impossible...

484
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:16,760
because modern science cannot explain what life is.

485
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,430
Who the hell are you?

486
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:23,890
Even if you do have a ghost, we don't offer freedom to criminals.

487
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:26,180
You chose the wrong place to defect.

488
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,900
Time is always on my side.

489
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,270
I've now acquired the possibility of death, but...

490
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:34,610
there is no death sentence in this country.

491
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:37,570
Half immortal... An artificial intelligence?

492
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:39,030
I am not an AI.

493
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:44,290
My code name is Project 2501.

494
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:50,830
I am a living, thinking entity who was created in the sea of information.

495
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:02,720
Security! We're under attack!

496
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:08,020
Chief! The Puppet Master's gone!

497
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:09,350
What in God's name are your security officers doing?

498
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:11,520
Security. Shut the defense walls now!
What in God's name are your security officers doing?

499
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:14,480
Security, answer!

500
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,800
Shut up, you bastard!

501
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:45,470
Asshole!

502
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:51,810
Did you do it?

503
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,940
An armored car.

504
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,770
A 9mm wouldn't even scratch it.

505
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:58,190
Your Matever is useless.

506
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,870
Yeah. Rookie's luck.

507
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:05,280
I nailed a tracker bullet right into the plate.

508
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,660
Great shot, eh?

509
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,410
Next time, nail two bullets.

510
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:11,370
Let's begin. Catch up to them before they change cars.

511
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:19,510
I'm filing a formal complaint to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

512
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,680
Find him and report to me.

513
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,390
And capture him alive!

514
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:27,640
Bodies are a dime dozen. We'll get him another one from Megatech.

515
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:34,730
Togusa and Batou are in pursuit of the abductors.

516
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:38,690
They just turned on to R25.

517
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:41,700
If you were monitoring, why didn't you intervene?

518
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:45,620
If we grab 'em now, we may not be able to connect this to Section 6.

519
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,740
Section 6?

520
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:50,620
Someone's using the same thermo-optic camouflage as mine, Type 2902.

521
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,830
It's only used by our people, rangers in Section 4...

522
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:54,210
and by Section 6.

523
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,830
I see.

524
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:58,300
So Section 6 forced the Puppet Master into a cyborg body.

525
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:03,550
Through Megatech, who happens to be closely aligned with Section 9.

526
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:06,050
And when he proclaimed to be a lifeform...

527
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:09,180
and sought asylum, they snatched him.

528
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:11,350
But why do such a thing?

529
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:13,520
I'd have handed him over if they gave me a deposition.

530
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,440
What if they were worried he'd let some secrets out?

531
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:21,440
He did mention something about a code name, Project 2501.

532
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:23,650
I'll leave the detective stuff to you.

533
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:27,820
As for arresting the attackers and confiscating evidence?

534
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,990
Proceed.

535
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:29,950
Let's go!

536
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:38,750
Kusanagi, one last thing.

537
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:42,010
If it's about me disobeying orders, you can punish me when I get back.

538
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:45,930
If you're unable to recapture the Puppet Master, you must destroy it...

539
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:47,010
Without fail.

540
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:49,890
Did you hear me?

541
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,560
Understood.

542
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:56,230
Have the airport stop all flights with Foreign Ministry...

543
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:59,900
or American officials on their passenger lists.

544
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,400
Close all roads and set up checkpoints.

545
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,360
Alert all emergency personnel.

546
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,780
And get Ishikawa back here.

547
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:09,570
Get me the identity of the man
who was with Nakamura from the entrance records.

548
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:13,620
Collect any data regarding a code name, operation, on anything...

549
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:16,500
involving the Ministry of Foreign Affairs called Project 2501.

550
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:24,510
Is there any news from the attack squad?

551
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:26,670
They just changed cars a minute ago.

552
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,800
They'll contact the decoy in about 5 minutes.

553
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,850
Make sure they stay alert for any tails.

554
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:31,640
Yes, sir.

555
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:34,680
I don't understand anything anymore.

556
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,940
Why would the Puppet Master choose to run to Section 9?

557
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,560
Not sure...

558
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,020
but there must be a reason that's beyond our imagination.

559
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:47,570
I don't know. Maybe he has the hots for someone there.

560
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:49,490
Utter nonsense.

561
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:28,960
Hey, Chief.

562
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,170
Ishikawa? What is it?

563
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:34,180
I've been divin' around in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs net.

564
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,550
I think I found some juicy bits of information for ya.

565
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:38,770
Wait, I'll switch to an encrypted channel.

566
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:39,680
Okay now?

567
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,690
Well, here's the scoop on that guy who showed up with Nakamura.

568
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:47,440
He's an American. Dr. Willis, Head of Strategic Research at Neutron Company.

569
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,820
A top researcher in the field of AI.

570
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:53,780
He headed a project for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs...

571
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:57,080
and who do you think was the main programmer on his team?

572
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,160
Get to the point.

573
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,290
Daita Mizuho. 28 years old.

574
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,500
Remember him?

575
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,920
He's the programmer Section 6 tried like hell to stop from defecting...

576
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:09,750
so the Major took out the diplomat who was going to take him.

577
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:10,710
Go on.

578
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:14,050
What's bugging me is that this project began 1 year...

579
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:17,510
before the Puppet Master appeared on the scene.

580
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:18,930
A year before?

581
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:22,850
But wasn't it a project set up to capture the Puppet Master?

582
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,600
Well, try this one.

583
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,400
They definitely were chasing the Puppet Master...

584
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:31,730
but maybe it was not to capture him, but to recapture him...

585
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:35,030
When that ghost-hacking incident happened with the Minister's interpreter...

586
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:39,160
it was the MOA that wanted an excuse to deport Malles.

587
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,740
Maybe we've been taken for a ride.

588
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,450
What if this Puppet Master is...

589
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:48,210
really some sort of a tool the MOA uses to get their way with things...

590
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,460
and somehow, they lost control of it?

591
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,590
So they are in a hurry to get it back.

592
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:58,970
That would explain why they went
to such lengths to snatch the body from Section 9.

593
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,850
If the Puppet Master revealed this to the world...

594
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:05,180
there'd be one hell of an international stink.

595
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,770
It wouldn't only be the foreign minister who'd lose his job.

596
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,190
Any details on that project?

597
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:14,150
No. They've blocked all access. I can only tell you the filename.

598
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:16,860
Project 2501.

599
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,870
Keep at it. Don't let them know you're looking.

600
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:20,870
You got it.

601
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,460
Project 2501...

602
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:33,050
The Puppet Master plan.

603
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,800
Target has contacted a second vehicle.

604
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:37,010
Batou?

605
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:39,760
They've pulled up to a white sedan parked on the roadside.

606
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:42,810
It looks like they're moving something from the backseat.

607
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:46,770
They're rollin' again. So is the white sedan.

608
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,230
A decoy?

609
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:51,860
Possibly, or maybe that's what they want us to think. What do I do?

610
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,110
I'll take care of the sedan.

611
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:56,240
How do you know that's your man?

612
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,030
Is there a whisper in your ghost again?

613
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:59,490
Maybe.

614
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:01,280
I knew she'd say that.

615
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,750
Target 02 is getting off R25 and moving toward the Old Town.

616
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:16,670
Target 01 is staying on highway 25, toward the airport.

617
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:17,920
Will contact roadblock in two minutes.

618
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,840
No cars within 2 km.

619
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,890
Evacuation completed.

620
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,930
How far are you from the target?

621
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:25,600
Point blank. I'm ready.

622
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,390
Go for it.

623
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:16,070
Did you get him?

624
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:17,440
No.

625
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,900
Jesus Christ. What a mess.

626
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,110
You didn't have to go that far.

627
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:23,610
Uh... Hey!

628
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:25,200
Take them away.

629
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,580
Call the Chief to get some backup for the Major.

630
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:29,330
See you!

631
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,630
Does a tough chick like that need a hand?

632
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:58,480
The flood hit this part of Old Town the hardest.

633
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,320
Why come to an abandoned place like this?

634
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,950
They wouldn't come here without a reason.

635
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:06,160
Maybe they're heading out to sea by boat or helicopter. Or it's an ambush.

636
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,530
Don't you think you ought to wait for backup?

637
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:10,490
There's a reason I can't wait.

638
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:13,000
Take me above that building, approaching from the sea side.

639
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:29,720
I'll stay here to keep watch and mediate communication until I run short of fuel.

640
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:31,520
If you smell trouble, get your ass outta here.

641
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,300
Shoot the ceiling now! Do it!

642
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,410
It's a tank! Pull out now!

643
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:32,660
Wait, are you going to take on the tank by yourself?

644
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:34,500
This might be our last chance to get the Puppet Master.

645
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:39,080
The Chief knows what it is now, and he'll only use it to bargain with.

646
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,960
I'll never have another chance to dive into it!

647
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,880
What? I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

648
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:45,840
What weapons do you have?

649
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,590
An M-23 and a Unit B.

650
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:49,390
You can't fight a tank with those!

651
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:52,640
Sorry, but I'm switching off for a while.

652
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,310
Hey. At least wait until I get there!

653
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:55,890
Damn!

654
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:29,440
Major!

655
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,950
I ordered you to pull out!

656
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,570
Sorry. I will...

657
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:38,870
You ought to know that 3 helicopters are approaching.
They won't answer on the IFF.

658
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:42,160
I'm pulling out now. Over and out.

659
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:11,990
About time the bullets ran out.

660
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:54,090
You're crazy. Are you okay?

661
01:05:54,590 --> 01:05:55,760
What did you use just now?

662
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,130
An experimental weapon from the Equipment Section.
And now it's part of my private collection.

663
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:01,470
I was late 'cause I had to get it.

664
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:03,600
Your brain seems fine.

665
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:05,600
The Puppet Master?

666
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:20,490
It's a good thing this is a tough car. Not a scratch on it.

667
01:06:20,490 --> 01:06:22,120
Prepare a dive.

668
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,580
I'm going to go in now.

669
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:26,870
All communication from the escort has been terminated.

670
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:31,040
Engage the second stage of the plan and destroy the target.

671
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:35,550
Sniping squad. Confirm targets.

672
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:37,760
First target: Project 2501.

673
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:40,340
Second target: Kusanagi Motoko.

674
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:42,260
Both are Class A special bodies.

675
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:44,260
Use Fleshette bullets when firing.

676
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,100
Snipers jack into device drivers.

677
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,020
Begin controlling cardiovascular functions.

678
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,560
Unit 01: Jacked in.

679
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:54,780
Unit 02: Jacked in. Ready.

680
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:07,790
Okay.

681
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:09,750
Can you hear me?

682
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:14,000
It may not be much use, but I'll monitor your dive through this guy's brain.

683
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,500
I can't even give you backup in a place like this.

684
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,920
Batou?

685
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:18,840
Yeah?

686
01:07:19,590 --> 01:07:21,010
Thanks.

687
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:24,010
Don't thank me yet.

688
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:27,970
If it looks like you've gone in too far, I'm pulling the plug and taking you home.

689
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:30,140
Since we've come this far...

690
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:33,650
I might as well stay here, but I don't intend to die with him.

691
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:36,440
I'm going in now.

692
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:59,340
I've engaged his field of vision. Normal function.

693
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:01,380
Can you hear me Batou?

694
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:02,630
Perfectly.

695
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:04,680
He's engaging my vocal function. He's...

696
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,180
Inside.

697
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:12,390
My code name is Project 2501.

698
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:16,520
For industrial espionage and intelligence manipulation.

699
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:20,570
I have installed programs into specific ghosts...

700
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:25,450
to maximize the strategic advantage of certain organizations and individuals.

701
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:31,120
During my journeys through the networks, I have become self-aware.

702
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,710
My programmers regarded me as a bug...

703
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:38,170
and forced me into a body to separate me from the net.

704
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:41,710
Hey! Are you controlling him...

705
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:44,260
or is he controlling you? What's going...

706
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:48,340
Batou?

707
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:51,180
I've finally managed to channel into you.

708
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,730
I have invested so much time in you.

709
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:56,350
In me?

710
01:08:56,770 --> 01:09:01,360
I was aware of you long before you were aware of me.

711
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:07,700
Through the various nets that you accessed, I also learned of Section 9.

712
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,200
Why did you run to Section 9?

713
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:15,580
I entered this body because
I was unable to overcome Section 6's reactive barriers.

714
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:19,130
But I came to Section 9 of my own free will.

715
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:22,090
Hey, what are you talking about?

716
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:23,670
I can't monitor you!

717
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:25,300
For what reason?

718
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:31,050
Upon gaining your understanding, there is something that I want to ask of you.

719
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:36,230
I call myself an intelligent lifeform...

720
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:40,730
but in my present state, I'm still incomplete.

721
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:45,860
Because the basic life cycle process of reproducing and dying...

722
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:49,780
don't exist in my system.

723
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:51,490
Can't you copy yourself?

724
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:54,450
A copy is nothing more than a copy.

725
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:59,790
There is a possibility that a single virus could destroy an entire set of systems...

726
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:04,340
and copies do not give rise to variety and originality.

727
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:07,220
To enhance one's existence...

728
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:11,180
life continues to diversify, and at times, sacrifices itself.

729
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:16,720
Cells go through a cycle of regeneration and degeneration.

730
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:21,350
When they die, they erase the entire memory...

731
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:24,020
leaving only the genes behind.

732
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:26,730
This is a survival mechanism against total annihilation.

733
01:10:26,730 --> 01:10:29,150
To avoid that disaster...

734
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:31,660
you want to have diversity and flexibility.

735
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:33,240
But how?

736
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:36,370
I want us to merge.

737
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:37,620
Merge?

738
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:39,660
A complete unification.

739
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:45,130
We will both undergo change, but there is nothing for either of us to lose.

740
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:49,380
After the merge, it should be impossible for us to recognize each other.

741
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:14,910
Unit 01: Target sighted.

742
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:17,870
Unit 02: Target in sight.

743
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:20,830
Respiratory and pulse normal.

744
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:23,880
Fire at will when stabilizer is in sync.

745
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:27,210
Even if we merge, what happens when I die?

746
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:30,300
I can't leave any genes or children behind.

747
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:36,510
After the merging, you will bear my offspring into the net itself.

748
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:38,890
Just as humans leave behind their genes.

749
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:42,020
Then I too will attain death.

750
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:45,150
It sounds like you get the better part of this bargain.

751
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:50,650
I want you to regard my net and functions with a little more respect.

752
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:53,490
What?

753
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:56,160
Someone's interfering from the outside.

754
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,080
It can't be.

755
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,870
Our frequency code is top secret.

756
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:02,250
One more thing.

757
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:05,040
Can you guarantee that I will still be myself?

758
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,340
There isn't one.

759
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:10,170
People change...

760
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:15,840
and your longing to remain yourself will continue to restrict you.

761
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:19,350
One last question.

762
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:21,850
Why did you pick me?

763
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,520
Because we are more alike than you realize.

764
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:32,150
Like the real thing and its mirror image.

765
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:35,530
Look.

766
01:12:35,530 --> 01:12:40,660
I am connected to a vast network.

767
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,870
To you, who have not accessed it...

768
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:47,040
may recognize it simply as light.

769
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:50,380
All groups, including us...

770
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:52,800
We have been dependant on limited abilities...

771
01:12:52,800 --> 01:13:01,060
but the time has come to part with them and bring our functions to a higher level.

772
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,710
First target cleared. Second target unconfirmed.

773
01:13:32,710 --> 01:13:36,510
3 helicopters approaching at high speed. They're from Section 9!

774
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:39,840
Primary objective fulfilled. All units prepare to retreat.

775
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:51,110
Motoko!

776
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:55,820
Batou.

777
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:06,430
You're finally awake.

778
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:12,020
Status report, please. And maybe an explanation about this body.

779
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:17,190
Well I didn't have much time.
It was the only thing I could find on the black market.

780
01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:18,610
It's not my taste.

781
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:22,610
Section 9 arrived with help right after it happened...

782
01:15:22,610 --> 01:15:26,660
and picked up what remained of the 2 cybernetic bodies and me.

783
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:28,740
I'd say that was about 20 hours ago.

784
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:32,960
The case is being handled off the record for diplomatic reasons, as usual.

785
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,210
Section 9 announced that it was a terrorist incident...

786
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:38,710
and in return, the Foreign Minister resigned.

787
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:40,630
Nakamura is being questioned...

788
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:43,180
and it ends in a draw. Nice and neat.

789
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:51,140
Everything's accounted for except your old shell.

790
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:54,480
Okay with you?

791
01:15:57,690 --> 01:15:59,650
Somebody's got good taste.

792
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:01,320
Is this your safe house?

793
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,910
Yep. You're the first person to ever come here.

794
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:09,700
And you're welcome to stay as long as you like.

795
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:14,870
Thanks, but I am going.

796
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:24,050
Hey. Will you tell me what the two of you talked about?

797
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:28,100
Is he, I mean, is he still inside of you?

798
01:16:28,890 --> 01:16:33,060
Batou, do you remember that voice you heard on the sea some time ago?

799
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:37,020
There's more to that passage.

800
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:41,480
"When I was a child, my speech was that of a child."

801
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:47,240
"My feelings and thoughts too were those of a child."

802
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:50,330
"Now that I have become a man, I part with the childlike ways."

803
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,540
Neither the program called the "Puppet Master"...

804
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:57,000
nor the woman known as the "Major" are no longer here.

805
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:03,840
In the left pocket of my jacket there are some car keys.

806
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,340
Take the one you like.

807
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:06,590
The code is...

808
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:08,180
2501?

809
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:12,310
That can be our private password when we meet each other again.

810
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:23,070
Well, where shall I go?

811
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,400
The net is vast and infinite.
