{20720}{20775}Very well. Ill deal|with this at once.
{20879}{20930}Give me the police station,|quickly, please.
{20931}{21019}I dont think we need bother the police,|dear. The facts of the matter--
{21021}{21068}Kindly do not attempt to|cloud the issue with facts.
{21070}{21169}One fact, and one fact alone|is crystal clear! Katie Nannas|faltered at her post.
{21171}{21248}Shes let the family down.|And I shall bring her to bo--
{21274}{21360}Oh. Shes left us,|hasnt she?

{21580}{21662}I should like you to send|a policeman around immediately.

{21704}{21803}What? Oh, how very prompt.|What wonderful service.
{21804}{21872}Thank you so much. Good night.
{21874}{21923}- Come in, Constable. Come in.|- Thank you, sir.
{21924}{21989}While going about my duties|on the other side of the park...
{21991}{22039}I noted some valuables|that had gone astray.
{22040}{22099}- I believe theyre yours, sir.|- Valuables?
{22100}{22155}Come along, now. Come along.
{22210}{22288}Jane! Michael!
{22290}{22331}Winifred, please dont|be emotional.
{22332}{22436}Oh, I wouldnt be too hard on em, sir.|Theyve had a long, weary walk today.
{22438}{22496}Children, come here at once.
{22616}{22695}- Well?|- Im sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.
{22696}{22793}- You see, it was windy.|- And the kite was too strong for us.
{22795}{22889}In a manner of speaking, sir, it was the|kite that ran away, not the children.
{22891}{22950}Thank you, Constable.|I think I can manage this.
{22952}{23067}Actually it wasnt a very good kite.|We made it ourselves.
{23068}{23112}Perhaps if you helped us|to make one--
{23114}{23209}Ah, thats the ticket, sir.|Kites are skittish things.
{23211}{23252}Why, only last week with|me own youngsters--
{23254}{23316}Im very grateful to you,|Constable, for returning the children.
{23318}{23421}And Im sure that|if you go to the kitchen,|Cookll find you a plate of something.
{23423}{23503}Thank you, sir.|I shall now return to my duties.
{23504}{23558}Thank you, Constable.
{23560}{23660}Good night, miss. Good night, maam.|Good night, sir.
{23661}{23717}Cookll find me something.|I never--
{23791}{23867}Im awfully sorry|about this, George.
{23868}{23921}Ill expect youll want|to discuss it.
{23923}{23975}I would indeed!
{23977}{24034}Ellen, take Jane and Michael|upstairs straightaway.
{24036}{24115}Yes, sir.
{24116}{24236}I knew it. When alls|said and done, who bears|the brunt of everything around here?
{24238}{24276}Me, thats who!
{24277}{24365}They dont want an honest,|hard-workin girl around here.
{24367}{24420}They need a ruddy zookeeper.
{24452}{24528}Im sorry, dear, but when|I chose Katie Nanna...
{24530}{24578}I thought she would be|firm with the children.
{24580}{24628}She looked|so solemn and cross.
{24629}{24714}Winifred, never confuse efficiency|with a liver complaint.
{24716}{24762}Ill try to do better next time.
{24764}{24836}Next time? My dear, youve engaged|six nannies in the last four months!
{24838}{24928}- And theyve all been|unqualified disasters.|- I quite agree.
{24929}{25002}Choosing a nanny for the children|is an important and delicate task.
{25004}{25134}It requires insight, balanced judgment,|and an ability to read character.
{25136}{25243}Under the circumstances,|I think it might be apropos|to take it upon myself to, uh...
{25244}{25293}select the next person.
{25295}{25356}- Oh, would you, George?|- Obviously the way to find|a proper nanny...
{25357}{25405}is to go about it|in a proper fashion.
{25407}{25476}I shall put an advertisement in|the Times: Take this down please.
{25478}{25524}- Yes, of course, dear.|- Wanted.
{25526}{25579}Uh, no. Uh, required.
{25580}{25704}Nanny: firm, respectable,|no nonsense.
{25705}{25797}A BritisH nanny|must be a general
{25799}{25884}THe future empire|lies witHin Her Hands
{25886}{25984}And so tHe person tHat we need|to mould tHe breed
{25986}{26060}Is a nanny|wHo can give commands
{26062}{26116}- You getting this, Winifred?|- Oh, yes, dear. Every word.
{26118}{26208}A BritisH bank|is run witH precision
{26210}{26298}A BritisH Home|requires notHing less
{26299}{26416}Tradition, discipline and rules|must be tHe tools

{26675}{26723}The Times will be so pleased.
{26724}{26784}- Father?|- Yes?
{26789}{26845}Weve discussed everything...
{26847}{26904}and were very sorry|about what we did today.
{26906}{26959}I should certainly think so.
{26961}{27025}- It was wrong to run away|from Katie Nanna.|- It was indeed.
{27027}{27081}And we do so want to get on|with the new nanny.
{27083}{27157}Very sensible. I shall be glad|to have your help in the matter.
{27159}{27232}We thought you would. Thats why|we wrote this advertisement.
{27234}{27291}- Advertisement for what?|- For the new nanny.
{27292}{27359}- You wrote an advert--|- George, I think we should listen.
{27361}{27462}- You said you wanted our help.|- But, I-- Oh, very well.

{30342}{30390}Im well aware theyre|just children, Winifred.

{32791}{32859}But I have told you|time and time again, Ellen...
{32860}{32926}I dislike being hurried|into things.
{32928}{33036}I dont understand. Theyre not|what we advertised for at all.
{34233}{34273}Michael, look!

{34917}{35016}Its her. Its the person. Shes|answered our advertisement.
{35018}{35098}Rosy cheeks and everything.
{35203}{35270}Ellen, you may now show them in,|one at a time.

{35796}{35858}Well, well ye--|Yes, of course, I mean. Uh--
{35859}{35909}You brought your references,|I presume. May I see them?
{35911}{35962}Oh, I make it a point|never to give references.
{35964}{36013}A very old-fashioned idea|to my mind.
{36015}{36084}Is that so? Well have to see|about that then, wont we?
{36086}{36169}Now then, the qualifications.
{36171}{36236}"Item one:|a cheery disposition.
{36237}{36284}I am never cross.
{36285}{36357}"Item two: rosy cheeks.
{36359}{36396}Obviously.
{36397}{36489}"Item three:|Play games, all sorts.
{36491}{36553}Well, Im sure the children will find|my games extremely diverting.
{36555}{36639}May I? Eh, this paper? Where did you|get it from? I thought I tore it up.
{36640}{36736}Excuse me. Item four:|You must be kind.
{36738}{36815}I am kind,|but extremely firm.
{36816}{36870}- Have you lost something?|- Ah! Yeah.
{36871}{36942}That paper, you see.|I thought that I--
{36944}{37005}- You are George Banks, are you not?|- What?
{37007}{37080}And you did advertise|for a nanny, did you not?
{37082}{37147}- George Banks.|- Very well then.
{37176}{37244}I tore it up,|turned it over.
{37245}{37299}Tore it up again|and threw it in there. Yes.
{37300}{37349}I beg your pardon.|Are you ill?
{37375}{37440}I hope not.
{37441}{37520}Now, about my wages.|The reference here is very obscure.
{37521}{37584}- Very obscure.|- We must be very clear on|that point, mustnt we?
{37586}{37650}- Yes, we must indeed.|- I shall require|every second Tuesday off.
{37652}{37705}Every Tuesday.
{37790}{37863}On second thoughts, I believe|a trial period would be wise.

{38189}{38246}Ill see the children now.|Thank you.
{38601}{38683}Close your mouth please,|Michael. We are not a codfish.

{39095}{39138}You mean youve|selected one already?
{39140}{39206}- Yes, its done. Its, its all done.|- Well, where is she?
{39208}{39271}What? Well, eh, shes in|the nursery of course, I mean.
{39272}{39334}-I put her to work straightaway, I mean.|-How clever of you!
{39336}{39408}I would have muddled|the whole thing.
{39409}{39512}Tell me, is she everything|that wed hoped shed be?
{39514}{39606}Well, i-it all happened rather|quickly. I mean, I-- I, uh--
{39608}{39665}Will she be firm?|Will she give commands?
{39667}{39751}Will she mould our young breed?
{39752}{39814}You know, Winifred,|I think she will.
{39842}{39894}- I think she will.|- In that case...
{39896}{39972}perhaps youd better tell Ellen|to dismiss the others.
{39974}{40084}- The others? Oh, yes. Ellen?|- Y-Yes, sir?
{40086}{40161}Tell the other applicants they may go.|The position has been filled.
{40163}{40241}- The others, sir?|- Yes, the others.
{40293}{40360}How many nannies does she|think we need in this house?
{40422}{40501}The position|has been filled.
{40646}{40717}Im afraid the nursery|isnt very tidy.
{40719}{40772}It is rather like|a bear pit, isnt it?
{40774}{40835}- Thats a funny sort of bag.|- Carpet.
{40837}{40887}- You mean to carry carpets in?|- No. Made of.
{40889}{40993}This is your room, and theres|a lovely view of the park.
{40995}{41061}Hmm.
{41063}{41122}Well, its not exactly|Buckingham Palace.
{41193}{41264}Still, its clean.
{41266}{41328}Yes, I think it will be|quite suitable.
{41330}{41376}Just needs a touch|here and there.
{41415}{41472}Well, first things first.
{41474}{41566}I always say, the place|to hang a hat is on a hat stand.
{41917}{41988}Ah! This will never do!
{42125}{42205}I much prefer seeing|all of my face at the same time.
{42237}{42302}There-- But there was|nothing in it.
{42303}{42378}Never judge things|by their appearance.
{42379}{42441}Even carpetbags.|Im sure I never do.
{42587}{42663}A thing of beauty|is a joy forever.
{42775}{42853}Mmm, a little more light, perhaps.
{43123}{43185}We better keep an eye|on this one.
{43187}{43252}- Shes tricky.|- Shes wonderful.
{43254}{43316}Much better!
{43336}{43391}Now, let me see.

{43895}{43975}Well, thats the funniest thing I ever|saw. I know its down here somewhere.
{43976}{44046}Ah, ha-ha, ha-ha!|Here it is.
{44047}{44128}Good. Come along, then. Quickly.

{95105}{95219}Yes, Father.|Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious
{95221}{95332}Winifred, will you be good enough|to explain this unseemly hullabaloo?
{95334}{95399}I dont think theres anything|to explain. Do you?
{95401}{95460}Its obvious that youre|out of sorts this morning.
{95462}{95508}The children just came in|to make you feel better.
{95510}{95572}I should like to make one thing|quite clear, once and for all.
{95574}{95652}I am not out of sorts.|I am in a perfectly equable mood.
{95654}{95721}I do not require|being made to feel better!
{95722}{95808}But youre always saying that you wanted|a cheerful and pleasant household.
{95810}{95877}Winifred, I should like to make|a slight differentiation...
{95878}{95940}between the word cheerful and|just plain giddy irresponsibility.
{95942}{96042}Excuse me, dear.|Posts, everyone, please!
{96044}{96106}I have no objection to anyone|being cheerful or pleasant.
{96107}{96154}But I do expect|a certain decorum.
{96155}{96225}I can tell you one thing, Winifred.|I dont propose standing idly by...
{96226}{96309}and letting that woman, Mary Poppins,|undermine the discipline and--
{96355}{96417}Theres something odd,|I may say extremely odd...
{96418}{96480}about the behaviour of this household|since that woman arrived.
{96482}{96566}- And I want you to know|that Ive noticed it!|- Yes, dear.
{96636}{96698}- One thing more.|- Yes, dear?
{96699}{96746}I suggest you have|this piano repaired.
{96748}{96822}When I sit down to an instrument,|I like to have it in tune.
{96824}{96895}But, George, you dont play.
{96897}{96986}Madam, that is entirely|beside the point!
{97305}{97405}Now, let me see. First of all,|we must go to the piano tuners.
{97406}{97470}And then we go to Mrs Corys sh--
{97472}{97558}Mrs Corys shop for some gingerbread.|Ah, gingerbread!
{97560}{97620}And then we go to the fishmongers,|I think, for a nice dover sole...
{97622}{97656}and a pint of prawns.
{97658}{97728}Uh, Michael,|stop stravaging along behind.
{97730}{97794}Ahoy, there! Ahoy!
{97833}{97902}- Good day to you!|- Good morning, Admiral.
{97904}{98030}Michael, what fine adventure|are we off upon today?

{106985}{107081}Well, its the most|disgraceful sight Ive ever seen,|or my name isnt Mary Poppins.
{107083}{107163}Speaking of names, I know a man|with a wooden leg named Smith.
{107165}{107248}Whats the name|of his other leg?

{108644}{108701}Oh, yeah.|Uh, speaking of weather...
{108703}{108754}the other day|when it was so cold...
{108756}{108843}a friend of mine went to buy|some long underwear, you know.
{108845}{108922}The shopkeeper said to him,|"How long do you want it?
{108924}{109009}And my friend said,|"Well, from about September to March.
{109117}{109181}Jane! Control yourself!
{109223}{109331}Children, will you please|sit up properly at the table?

{109611}{109673}Oh, no, there is a way.
{109674}{109735}Frankly I,|I dont like to mention it...
{109737}{109789}because you have to think|of something sad.
{109791}{109844}Then do get on with it, please!
{109845}{109915}Let me see.
{109917}{109975}Ive got the very thing.
{109977}{110089}Yesterday when the lady|next door answered the bell,|there was a man there.
{110091}{110213}And the man said to the lady,|"Im terribly sorry.|I just ran over your cat.
{110215}{110304}- Oh, thats sad.|- The poor cat.
{110306}{110384}And then the man said,|"Id like to replace your cat.
{110385}{110465}And the lady said,|"Thats all right with me, but|how are you at catching mice?
{110575}{110659}Well, you know I started out sad.|I, I try, really I do.
{110661}{110770}But, but everything ends up|so hilarious, I cant--
{110772}{110815}I cant help--
{110875}{110965}That will be quite enough of that!
{110966}{111023}Its time to go home.
{111025}{111067}- Oh, that is sad.|- Oh, no!
{111069}{111155}Oh, thats sad. Thats|the saddest thing I ever heard.
{111188}{111236}Come along, children. Spit spot!
{111237}{111301}Must you really go?
{111303}{111370}You know, people come to see me|all the time, you know.
{111372}{111473}And, and we have such a lovely time,|and then they have to go home.
{111474}{111573}And, and Im very, very sad|about the whole thing.
{111575}{111638}Dont worry.|Well come back soon.
{111640}{111688}We had a lovely time.
{111689}{111750}Uh, keep an eye on Uncle Albert,|will you, Bert?
{111752}{111873}- Ill sit with him a while.|- Thank you. Come on.
{111874}{111989}Uncle Albert, I got a jolly joke|I saved for just such an occasion.
{111991}{112072}- Would you like to hear it?|- Id be so grateful.
{112073}{112158}Righto. Well,|its about me granddad, see?
{112160}{112218}And one night,|he had a nightmare, he did.
{112220}{112290}- So scared that he chewed|his pillow to bits.|- Yes.
{112292}{112342}- To bits.|- Yes.|- Next morning I says...
{112344}{112379}- "How do you feel, Granddad?|- Yes.
{112381}{112478}He says, "Oh, not bad.|A little down in the mouth!
{112610}{112657}Yeah, I always say theres|nothing like a good joke.
{112659}{112759}No. And that was nothing|like a good joke! That--
{113145}{113195}Bit late tonight,|arent you, Banks?
{113240}{113336}I say, Banks!|Is anything the matter, Banks?
{113337}{113396}Banks!
{113536}{113608}- Oh, Father, were so glad youre home!|- Want to hear a joke?
{113610}{113673}We had the most wonderful|afternoon with Mary Poppins.
{113675}{113736}Speaking of afternoons,|the joke goes like this.
{113737}{113790}I know a man with a wooden leg|named Smith.
{113792}{113864}Smith? We dont know anyone|called Smith.
{113865}{113979}And there was a second chap,|and the second chap says,|"Whats the name of his other leg?
{113980}{114052}And we had a lovely tea party|on the ceiling!
{114053}{114096}Oh, children,|please be quiet.
{114098}{114167}Mary Poppins says if were good,|shell take us there again.
{114168}{114276}Oh. Oh, Mary Poppins|said that, did she?
{114277}{114344}Will you please return|to your room.
{114345}{114432}Mary Poppins, will you|be kind enough to come with me?
{114434}{114481}As you wish.
{114538}{114632}Mary Poppins, I very much regret|what I must say to you.
{114732}{114817}- Good evening, George.|Is anything the matter?|- Im afraid there is.
{114819}{114902}I, Id love to stay, but I have|to dress for my rally in Hampstead.
{114904}{114955}Winifred, it is my wish|that you be present!
{114956}{115003}Oh, yes, George,|of course.
{115004}{115102}Mary Poppins, I must confess I am|extremely disappointed in you.
{115104}{115192}Shes for it now. Ive heard|the master do this speech before.
{115193}{115267}I dont deny that I am partially|responsible for allowing the children...
{115268}{115363}to spend their days on worthless|frivolity to the exclusion of all else!
{115364}{115432}But it is high time they learned|the seriousness of life!
{115434}{115484}But, George,|theyre only children.
{115486}{115536}Precisely. And in the light|of what has happened--
{115537}{115594}George, are you certain|you know what youre doing?
{115596}{115645}I believe I do, Winifred.
{115647}{115737}A BritisH bank|is run witH precision

{116248}{116331}THat lifes a looming battle|to be faced and fougHt
{116332}{116398}In short, I am disturbed to hear|my children talking about...
{116400}{116444}popping in and out|of chalk pavement pictures...
{116445}{116525}consorting with racehorse|persons, fox hunting.
{116527}{116580}Yes, well I dont mind|that quite so much.
{116582}{116620}At any rate,|its traditional.
{116622}{116682}But tea parties on the ceiling?|I ask you.
{116684}{116802}Having tea parties on the|ceiling and highly-questionable|outings of every other kind!
{116803}{116907}If tHey must go on outings|THese outings ougHt to be

{118701}{118789}I shall see they have a proper|nights sleep. Good night.
{119041}{119131}Winifred, did I say that I was going|to take the children to the bank?
{119133}{119204}- It certainly sounded that way, dear.|- Oh.
{119205}{119260}And why not?|A capital idea!
{119261}{119337}Just the medicine they need|for all this slipshod, sugary...

{119397}{119437}Quite right. Good idea.|Quite right.
{119439}{119497}Good idea. Quite right.
{119540}{119609}Mary Poppins,|we wont let you go!
{119611}{119659}Go? What on earth|are you talking about?
{119661}{119765}- Didnt you get sacked?|- Sacked? Certainly not!|I am never sacked!

{181240}{181288}Well, get on with it. Go on.
{181289}{181343}Uh, yes, Father.
{181425}{181522}In 1 773, an official|of this bank...
{181524}{181584}unwisely loaned|a large sum of money...
{181585}{181688}to finance a shipment of tea|to the American colonies.
{181689}{181782}- Do you know what happened?|- Yes, sir. Yes, I think I do.
{181784}{181833}Uh, uh, as the ship lay|in Boston Harbor...
{181835}{181900}uh, a party of the colonists|dressed as red Indians...
{181901}{182023}uh, boarded the vessel,|behaved very rudely, and,|and threw all the tea overboard.
{182024}{182094}This made the tea|unsuitable for drinking...
{182096}{182161}even for Americans.
{182277}{182371}Precisely.|The loan was defaulted.
{182372}{182437}Panic ensued within these walls.
{182439}{182514}There was a run on the bank!
{182516}{182565}From that time to this, sir...
{182567}{182651}there has not been|a run on this bank...
{182712}{182763}until today!
{182764}{182886}A run, sir, caused by the|disgraceful conduct of your son.
{182887}{182974}- Do you deny it?|- I do not deny it, sir.
{182975}{183075}And I shall be only too glad|to assume responsibility for my son.
{183164}{183263}- What are you waiting for?|Get on with it!|- Uh, y-yes, Father.
{183727}{183783}- No, not that!|- Steady on.

{184441}{184549}when theres nothing to say,|all you can say i--
{184634}{184707}Confound it, Banks! I said,|do you have anything to say?
{184783}{184852}-Just one word, sir.|- Yes?
{184854}{184912}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.
{184961}{184988}What?
{184990}{185062}Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious.
{185064}{185143}Mary Poppins was right.|Its extraordinary.|It does make you feel better!
{185180}{185232}What are you talking about, man?|Theres no such word.
{185234}{185316}Oh, yes. It is a word.|A perfectly good word, actually.
{185318}{185356}Do you know what theres|no such thing as?
{185358}{185439}It turns out, with due respect,|when all is said and done...
{185440}{185512}that theres|no such thing as you!
{185514}{185559}- Impertinence, sir!|- Speaking of impertinence...
{185560}{185620}would you like to hear|a perfectly marvellous joke?
{185622}{185687}- A real snapper!|-Joke? Snapper?
{185688}{185767}Yes. There are these two wonderful|young people,Jane and Michael.
{185768}{185852}And they meet one day on the street,|and Jane says to Michael...
{185853}{185920}"I know a man with|a wooden leg named Smith.
{185921}{186023}And Michael says, "Really?|Whats the name of his other leg?

{186496}{186566}I dont know. I might pop|through a chalk pavement picture,
{186568}{186605}and go for an outing|in the country.
{186607}{186690}Or I might seize a horse off|a merry-go-round, and win the Derby!
{186691}{186791}Or I might just fly a kite!|Only Poppins would know!
{186792}{186891}- Poppins?|- My nanny. Shes the one who|sings that ridiculous song.
