THE SEVENTH SEAL

00:01:55.63,00:01:59.80
"And when the Lamb had opened[br]the seventh seal...

00:02:00.91,00:02:06.28
"there was silence in heaven[br]about the space of half an hour.

00:02:09.75,00:02:14.55
"And the seven angels[br]which had the seven trumpets...

00:02:14.62,00:02:17.59
"prepared themselves to sound."

00:04:12.30,00:04:13.74
Who are you?

00:04:14.81,00:04:16.74
I am Death.

00:04:16.81,00:04:19.07
You have come for me?

00:04:19.14,00:04:21.87
I have been at your side[br]for a long time.

00:04:21.95,00:04:23.68
I know.

00:04:23.75,00:04:25.44
Are you prepared?

00:04:25.52,00:04:28.85
My flesh is afraid, but I am not.

00:04:37.36,00:04:38.95
Wait a moment.

00:04:39.03,00:04:43.40
You all say that.[br]But I give no respite.

00:04:43.47,00:04:45.63
You play chess, do you not?

00:04:45.70,00:04:48.60
How do you know that?

00:04:48.67,00:04:51.16
I have seen it in paintings.

00:04:51.24,00:04:55.77
Yes, I am quite a skilful player.

00:04:55.85,00:04:58.01
But no more so than I.

00:04:58.08,00:05:00.07
Why do you wish to play chess with me?

00:05:00.15,00:05:03.95
- That's my concern.[br]- You're quite right.

00:05:05.02,00:05:08.36
As long as I resist you, I live.

00:05:08.43,00:05:11.16
If I win, you set me free.

00:05:18.60,00:05:20.73
Black for you!

00:05:21.81,00:05:24.10
It becomes me well.

00:06:39.45,00:06:42.65
Between a strumpet's legs I lie

00:06:44.92,00:06:48.09
That's the place for such as I

00:06:53.63,00:06:58.36
The Lord is up aloft, you know

00:06:58.44,00:07:01.93
But Satan finds us here below

00:07:04.71,00:07:09.08
There's talk of omens[br]and other horrors.

00:07:09.15,00:07:12.45
Two horses had devoured each other...

00:07:12.52,00:07:17.65
graves gaped wide[br]and bones lay about.

00:07:19.06,00:07:22.22
Four suns were in the sky.

00:07:41.18,00:07:43.11
Where is the inn?

00:08:08.84,00:08:10.81
Did he show you the way?

00:08:10.88,00:08:12.81
Not exactly.

00:08:12.88,00:08:15.61
- What did he say?[br]- Nothing.

00:08:15.68,00:08:18.91
- Was he mute?[br]- No, milord.

00:08:18.98,00:08:23.01
He was most eloquent.

00:08:23.09,00:08:25.68
Indeed.

00:08:25.76,00:08:27.88
But very gloomy.

00:10:00.52,00:10:03.45
Have you had breakfast?

00:10:05.02,00:10:07.75
Pity I can't eat grass.

00:10:07.83,00:10:09.85
You must teach me.

00:10:09.93,00:10:12.62
We're feeling the pinch.

00:10:12.70,00:10:16.13
People here are not interested in art.

00:11:11.32,00:11:14.52
Mary! I have seen something!

00:11:14.59,00:11:16.53
What has happened?

00:11:18.06,00:11:22.00
A vision. It was quite real.

00:11:23.43,00:11:25.80
You and your visions!

00:11:28.74,00:11:30.93
I saw her anyway.

00:11:33.31,00:11:34.74
Who?

00:11:34.81,00:11:36.94
The Virgin Mary.

00:11:38.82,00:11:40.75
Did you really see her?

00:11:40.82,00:11:42.75
I could have touched her.

00:11:42.82,00:11:48.28
With her crown of gold[br]and her blue robe.

00:11:48.36,00:11:54.03
She was holding the Child[br]and teaching Him to walk.

00:11:54.10,00:11:58.03
When she saw me, she smiled.

00:11:58.87,00:12:01.03
I had tears in my eyes.

00:12:01.11,00:12:03.97
And when I wiped them away,[br]she was gone.

00:12:04.04,00:12:08.57
And there was a great silence...

00:12:08.65,00:12:11.24
in heaven and on earth.

00:12:15.09,00:12:17.61
The things you make up!

00:12:17.69,00:12:22.75
You don't believe me, but it was true.

00:12:22.83,00:12:25.89
It's not the reality you see,[br]but another kind.

00:12:25.96,00:12:30.02
Like the Devil[br]painting the wheels red...

00:12:30.10,00:12:32.07
and using his tail as a brush.

00:12:32.14,00:12:34.43
Why did you remind me?

00:12:34.51,00:12:37.53
And you had red paint under your nails.

00:12:37.61,00:12:41.67
Well, I did make that up...

00:12:41.75,00:12:44.24
so that you would believe[br]my other visions.

00:12:44.32,00:12:49.62
Mind you're not taken for a fool.

00:12:49.69,00:12:54.32
Because you're not. At least not yet.

00:12:54.39,00:12:58.73
It's not my fault if I hear voices...

00:12:58.80,00:13:03.29
and see the Virgin, and if angels[br]and devils like my company.

00:13:04.67,00:13:09.83
I have told you once and for all...

00:13:09.91,00:13:13.87
I must have sleep in the mornings!

00:13:13.95,00:13:17.94
I have asked you, but nothing helps.[br]Now will you shut up!

00:13:42.74,00:13:45.21
I want a better life for Michael.

00:13:45.28,00:13:49.80
He is going to be a great acrobat.

00:13:49.88,00:13:52.51
Or a juggler who does[br]the one impossible trick.

00:13:52.58,00:13:54.38
What trick is that?

00:13:54.45,00:13:57.51
Make a ball stand still in the air.

00:13:57.59,00:14:02.39
- But that's impossible.[br]- Yes, for us, but not for him.

00:14:04.06,00:14:06.00
Always daydreaming!

00:14:08.37,00:14:13.83
I've written a song.

00:14:13.90,00:14:15.84
Do you want to hear it?

00:14:15.91,00:14:19.27
Yes. I'm very curious.

00:14:19.34,00:14:23.34
A dove on a branch

00:14:23.41,00:14:26.71
At Midsummer time

00:14:26.78,00:14:30.91
She sang so sweetly of Jesus Christ

00:14:30.99,00:14:35.29
In heaven is great rejoicing

00:14:38.86,00:14:40.85
Are you asleep?

00:14:40.93,00:14:44.63
- It was a lovely song.[br]- It's not finished.

00:14:44.70,00:14:49.50
I heard, but I'll sleep a bit more.[br]Sing me the rest later.

00:14:49.57,00:14:52.44
You just sleep and sleep.

00:14:54.31,00:14:58.15
Is this a mask for an actor?

00:14:59.18,00:15:02.12
The priests pay well, so I play.

00:15:02.19,00:15:04.45
Going to play Death?

00:15:04.52,00:15:07.72
Scaring decent folk out of their wits.

00:15:07.79,00:15:09.76
When are we to perform?

00:15:09.83,00:15:11.92
At the Saints' Festival in Elsinore.

00:15:12.00,00:15:15.19
We will perform on the church steps.

00:15:15.27,00:15:20.20
Why not something bawdy?[br]People like it better.

00:15:20.27,00:15:24.83
They say the plague stalks the land.

00:15:24.91,00:15:29.04
The priests speculate in sudden death[br]and moral bellyache.

00:15:29.11,00:15:31.05
What parts are we playing?

00:15:31.12,00:15:33.98
A fool like you can play the Human Soul.

00:15:34.05,00:15:35.71
Not a good part.

00:15:35.79,00:15:39.45
Who decides? I'm the director[br]of the troupe.

00:15:41.36,00:15:44.19
"Your life, O fool...

00:15:44.26,00:15:46.92
"hangs by a thread.

00:15:48.60,00:15:50.69
"Short is your day."

00:15:53.27,00:15:56.64
Will the women love me in this get-up?

00:16:10.79,00:16:12.72
Well, what is it?

00:16:12.79,00:16:15.09
Don't move. Don't speak.

00:16:15.16,00:16:17.86
I'm as silent as the grave.

00:16:17.93,00:16:20.16
I love you.

00:16:48.33,00:16:50.26
What is this supposed to be?

00:16:50.33,00:16:51.85
The Dance of Death.

00:16:51.93,00:16:55.52
- And this is Death.[br]- Yes, he dances with them.

00:16:55.60,00:16:57.57
Why all this daubing?

00:16:57.64,00:17:00.54
To remind people of death.

00:17:00.60,00:17:02.73
That won't make them any happier.

00:17:02.81,00:17:08.21
Why make them happy?[br]Why not scare them?

00:17:08.28,00:17:10.44
Then they won't look at your picture.

00:17:10.51,00:17:13.18
Yes, they will.

00:17:13.25,00:17:15.95
A skull is more interesting[br]than a naked woman.

00:17:16.02,00:17:17.95
If you scare them--

00:17:18.02,00:17:19.96
- They'll think--[br]- Then they think.

00:17:20.02,00:17:23.39
- And are still more scared.[br]- And fall into the arms of the priests.

00:17:23.46,00:17:26.59
- That's not my business.[br]- You're only painting your picture.

00:17:26.66,00:17:30.03
I paint life as it is.[br]Then folk can do as they like.

00:17:30.10,00:17:32.50
That makes people angry.

00:17:32.57,00:17:35.94
Then I paint something funny.

00:17:36.01,00:17:38.24
A man must live.

00:17:38.31,00:17:41.11
At least till the plague takes him.

00:17:41.18,00:17:43.44
The plague. Ugh!

00:17:44.48,00:17:49.08
You should see the abscess...

00:17:49.15,00:17:54.82
the limbs knotted in frenzy.

00:17:57.96,00:17:59.86
Unpleasant.

00:18:02.23,00:18:06.14
They try to tear out the boils...

00:18:06.20,00:18:08.14
they bite their hands...

00:18:08.21,00:18:11.20
scratch open their veins...

00:18:11.28,00:18:14.61
scream in agony.

00:18:14.68,00:18:16.61
Did I scare you?

00:18:16.68,00:18:19.62
Scared? You don't know me.

00:18:20.52,00:18:22.78
What's that rubbish there?

00:18:22.85,00:18:26.62
People think the plague...

00:18:26.69,00:18:30.35
is a punishment from God.

00:18:30.43,00:18:34.89
Crowds wander the land[br]lashing each other...

00:18:34.97,00:18:37.09
to please the Lord.

00:18:37.17,00:18:39.03
Lashing each other?

00:18:39.10,00:18:42.20
Yes, it's a horrible sight.

00:18:42.27,00:18:45.61
You feel like hiding when they pass.

00:18:47.44,00:18:51.35
Give me a gin.[br]I've had nothing but water.

00:18:51.42,00:18:54.38
I feel as thirsty as a desert camel.

00:18:54.45,00:18:57.22
Scared after all?

00:19:26.35,00:19:29.55
I want to confess as best I can...

00:19:29.62,00:19:31.55
but my heart is void.

00:19:32.49,00:19:34.98
The void is a mirror.

00:19:35.06,00:19:38.62
I see my face...

00:19:38.70,00:19:43.00
and feel loathing and horror.

00:19:49.51,00:19:54.24
My indifference to men[br]has shut me out.

00:19:56.75,00:19:59.27
I live now in a world of ghosts...

00:19:59.35,00:20:02.32
a prisoner in my dreams.

00:20:02.39,00:20:05.95
- Yet you do not want to die.[br]- Yes, I do.

00:20:06.92,00:20:09.29
What are you waiting for?

00:20:09.36,00:20:10.85
Knowledge.

00:20:11.90,00:20:13.83
You want an guarantee.

00:20:13.90,00:20:15.92
Call it what you will.

00:20:21.21,00:20:25.01
Is it so hard to conceive God[br]with one's senses?

00:20:26.24,00:20:29.64
Why must He hide in a midst[br]of vague promises...

00:20:29.71,00:20:31.84
and invisible miracles?

00:20:33.42,00:20:37.32
How are we to believe the believers[br]when we don't believe ourselves?

00:20:37.39,00:20:41.45
What will become of us[br]who want to believe, but cannot?

00:20:41.53,00:20:45.33
And what of those[br]who neither will nor can believe?

00:20:45.40,00:20:47.96
Why can I not kill God within me?

00:20:48.03,00:20:51.87
Why does He go on living[br]in a painful, humiliating way?

00:20:51.94,00:20:55.84
I want to tear Him out of my heart...

00:20:55.91,00:20:59.31
but He remains a mocking reality...

00:20:59.38,00:21:01.78
which I cannot get rid of.

00:21:01.85,00:21:04.68
- Do you hear me?[br]- I hear you.

00:21:06.38,00:21:11.18
I want knowledge. Not belief.[br]Not surmise. But knowledge.

00:21:12.62,00:21:15.32
I want God to put out His hand...

00:21:15.39,00:21:18.66
show His face, speak to me.

00:21:18.73,00:21:21.06
But He is silent.

00:21:21.13,00:21:26.83
I cry to Him in the dark,[br]but there seems to be no one there.

00:21:26.90,00:21:28.90
Perhaps there is no one there.

00:21:28.97,00:21:31.84
Then life is a senseless terror.

00:21:31.91,00:21:37.18
No man can live with Death[br]and know that everything is nothing.

00:21:37.25,00:21:40.51
Most people think neither[br]of Death nor nothingness.

00:21:40.58,00:21:44.04
Until they stand on the edge of life[br]and see the Darkness.

00:21:44.12,00:21:46.68
Ah, that day.

00:21:47.93,00:21:49.79
I see.

00:21:50.86,00:21:53.96
We must make an idol of our fear...

00:21:54.03,00:21:57.99
and call it God.

00:21:58.07,00:22:00.00
You are uneasy.

00:22:01.10,00:22:03.97
Death visited me this morning.

00:22:04.04,00:22:07.24
We are playing chess.

00:22:07.31,00:22:11.04
This respite enables me[br]to perform a vital errand.

00:22:11.11,00:22:12.55
What errand?

00:22:13.82,00:22:17.65
My whole life has been[br]a meaningless search.

00:22:23.16,00:22:28.06
I say it without bitterness[br]or self-reproach.

00:22:28.13,00:22:31.57
I know it is the same for all.

00:22:33.60,00:22:38.77
But I want to use my respite[br]for one significant action.

00:22:41.41,00:22:45.51
So you play chess with Death?

00:22:45.58,00:22:48.14
He is a skilful tactician...

00:22:48.22,00:22:52.21
but I have not yet lost one piece.

00:22:52.29,00:22:55.52
How can you outwit Death?

00:22:56.76,00:23:01.49
By a combination[br]of bishop and knight...

00:23:03.07,00:23:05.00
I will break his flank.

00:23:07.60,00:23:09.77
I shall remember that.

00:23:15.48,00:23:19.88
Traitor! You have tricked me!

00:23:23.99,00:23:26.42
But I'll find a way out.

00:23:26.49,00:23:30.98
We will resume our game[br]at the inn.

00:23:38.34,00:23:43.24
This is my hand. I can move it.

00:23:43.31,00:23:46.54
The blood is pulsing in my veins.

00:23:48.08,00:23:51.45
The sun is still at the zenith...

00:23:53.82,00:23:56.22
and I, Antonius Block...

00:23:58.22,00:24:01.19
am playing chess with Death!

00:24:03.83,00:24:07.16
My master and I have been abroad.

00:24:11.44,00:24:13.63
The Crusades?

00:24:15.47,00:24:18.24
Ten years in the Holy Land...

00:24:18.31,00:24:20.67
bitten by snakes and flies...

00:24:20.74,00:24:24.74
slaughtered by savages,[br]poisoned by bad wine...

00:24:24.82,00:24:28.48
made lousy by women,[br]rotting with fever...

00:24:28.55,00:24:32.01
all for the glory of God.

00:24:32.09,00:24:34.15
The glory of God.

00:24:35.63,00:24:38.86
Our crusade was so stupid...

00:24:38.93,00:24:42.76
that only an idealist[br]could have thought it out.

00:24:47.50,00:24:50.27
That was horrid about the plague.

00:24:50.34,00:24:53.78
It's worse than that.

00:24:55.58,00:24:59.64
Whichever way we turn,[br]our backside's behind us.

00:24:59.72,00:25:03.78
Backside behind,[br]how true, how true.

00:25:07.76,00:25:11.32
Here's squire Jöns.[br]He grins at Death...

00:25:11.40,00:25:15.23
chuckles at the Lord,[br]laughs at himself...

00:25:15.30,00:25:17.43
and smiles at the girls.

00:25:17.50,00:25:19.53
His world exists only for himself.

00:25:19.60,00:25:22.77
Absurd to all, even to himself.

00:25:22.84,00:25:26.90
Meaningless in heaven,[br]indifferent in hell.

00:25:52.94,00:25:56.03
What's that stinking soup good for?

00:25:56.11,00:25:59.47
She has had carnal knowledge[br]of the Evil One.

00:26:00.44,00:26:02.71
And now she's in the stocks.

00:26:02.78,00:26:07.65
She's to be burnt tomorrow.[br]But we must keep the Devil away.

00:26:07.72,00:26:10.28
With the aid of that stinking muck?

00:26:10.35,00:26:14.76
Blood and gall of a black dog.

00:26:14.83,00:26:19.32
The Evil One can't stand the smell.

00:26:19.40,00:26:21.33
Nor can I.

00:26:30.54,00:26:33.74
Have you seen the Devil?

00:26:33.81,00:26:36.84
- You must not talk to her.[br]- Is that so dangerous?

00:26:36.91,00:26:42.01
She is thought to be the cause[br]of the plague.

00:27:13.65,00:27:16.48
Fate is a villain

00:27:16.55,00:27:19.78
And you're a poor wretch

00:27:19.86,00:27:22.52
Now bounding with glee

00:27:22.59,00:27:25.32
Now crawling with worms

00:27:27.13,00:27:28.76
Must you sing?

00:27:28.83,00:27:30.27
What?

00:29:34.96,00:29:39.12
Surprised that I steal from the dead?

00:29:39.20,00:29:41.93
A profitable trade nowadays.

00:29:44.70,00:29:48.90
It's no use telling tales.

00:29:48.97,00:29:52.91
It's everyone for himself.

00:29:56.11,00:30:00.01
Don't scream.[br]No one will hear you.

00:30:01.08,00:30:03.08
Isn't that surprising?

00:30:09.29,00:30:12.35
I know you.[br]You're Raval, the seminarist.

00:30:16.60,00:30:20.66
You're Doctor Mirabilis,[br]Coelestis et Diabilis.

00:30:20.74,00:30:22.67
Aren't I right?

00:30:23.91,00:30:27.31
Ten years ago[br]you persuaded my master...

00:30:27.38,00:30:30.14
to set off for the Holy Land.

00:30:32.95,00:30:36.11
Did I scare you?[br]Have you a pain in your belly?

00:30:38.22,00:30:42.32
Now I understand[br]these ten wasted years.

00:30:43.39,00:30:46.45
We were too well-off,[br]too satisfied.

00:30:46.53,00:30:48.83
The Lord wanted to chasten our pride.

00:30:50.43,00:30:55.53
So He sent you to poison[br]my master's mind.

00:30:55.61,00:30:57.66
I was in good faith.

00:30:57.74,00:31:01.30
Now you know better.[br]You've become a thief.

00:31:01.38,00:31:06.01
A more suitable occupation[br]for knaves.

00:31:12.86,00:31:15.38
Oh, I am not bloodthirsty.

00:31:16.46,00:31:21.23
But next time we meet,[br]I will brand your face as you deserve.

00:31:23.57,00:31:26.40
I came to get my water bottle filled.

00:31:34.84,00:31:37.40
Jöns is the name.

00:31:37.48,00:31:39.78
An amiable young man...

00:31:39.85,00:31:44.91
full of noble thoughts and deeds.

00:31:51.26,00:31:55.60
Farewell, my sweet.[br]I could have raped you...

00:31:55.67,00:31:58.16
but I don't believe in[br]that kind of love.

00:31:58.23,00:32:00.46
It's a little dull in the end.

00:32:04.84,00:32:07.87
Come to think of it,[br]I need a housekeeper.

00:32:07.94,00:32:10.61
Can you cook?

00:32:10.68,00:32:14.17
I hope my wife is dead by now.

00:32:15.35,00:32:17.34
So I need a housekeeper.

00:32:20.42,00:32:25.42
Well, don't stand there gaping![br]I've saved your life, you know!

00:32:41.78,00:32:44.04
Damn actors.

00:34:06.13,00:34:09.50
They're making fools of themselves.

00:34:10.87,00:34:14.27
I'm not in the first part[br]so I'll go behind the curtain.

00:34:15.77,00:34:18.47
Don't stand there gaping, ugly!

00:34:20.44,00:34:24.07
The horse is up the tree, crowing

00:34:26.32,00:34:30.25
The road is wide but the gate narrow

00:34:30.32,00:34:33.81
The Black One dances on the shore

00:34:36.86,00:34:41.69
The hen mews in a lake so dark

00:34:47.04,00:34:52.10
The day is red but the fish is dead

00:34:52.18,00:34:56.74
The Black One squats on the shore

00:34:59.62,00:35:03.21
The snake flaps high in the sky

00:35:06.29,00:35:09.88
The Virgin is pale[br]but the mouse's content

00:35:09.96,00:35:13.22
The Black One runs on the shore

00:35:16.17,00:35:19.23
The goat hisses

00:35:19.30,00:35:22.74
With his two teeth

00:35:27.54,00:35:30.48
The blast is heavy

00:35:30.55,00:35:33.57
The waves break

00:35:33.65,00:35:36.98
The Black One makes dung on the shore

00:36:37.41,00:36:42.37
The sow lays eggs and the cat grunts

00:36:44.52,00:36:48.12
The night is soot and the dark remains

00:36:48.19,00:36:52.32
The Black One stays, stays on the shore

00:39:16.01,00:39:18.57
God is punishing us.

00:39:22.71,00:39:26.94
We shall all perish[br]by the Black Death.

00:39:28.99,00:39:33.45
You there, gaping like cattle...

00:39:33.52,00:39:37.52
and you, bloated with complacency...

00:39:37.59,00:39:41.76
this might be your last hour.

00:39:44.67,00:39:48.54
Death is behind your back.

00:39:53.18,00:39:57.41
His scythe flashes above your heads.

00:39:57.48,00:40:00.75
Which of you will he strike first?

00:40:02.72,00:40:06.18
You there, with the stare of a goat...

00:40:06.26,00:40:09.59
will tonight see[br]your last twisted smile?

00:40:13.83,00:40:19.20
You, woman,[br]full of the lust of life...

00:40:21.27,00:40:25.37
will you wither before the dawn?

00:40:27.51,00:40:32.74
You, with the swollen nose...

00:40:33.95,00:40:39.12
will you pollute the earth[br]for another year?

00:40:40.12,00:40:43.89
Do you know, idiots,[br]that you are to die?

00:40:43.96,00:40:47.99
You are all doomed,[br]do you hear?

00:40:52.47,00:40:54.73
Doomed! Doomed! Doomed!

00:40:56.71,00:40:59.47
Lord, have mercy on us sinners.

00:40:59.54,00:41:03.91
Turn not away Thy face.

00:41:03.98,00:41:09.51
For the sake of Thy son, Jesus Christ!

00:42:12.75,00:42:15.95
Do they really expect modern people...

00:42:16.02,00:42:20.22
to take that drivel seriously?

00:42:21.66,00:42:24.06
You laugh at me, milord.

00:42:24.13,00:42:29.76
I've read and heard[br]all the fairy tales.

00:42:32.00,00:42:37.06
Even the ghost stories[br]about God the Father...

00:42:37.14,00:42:39.87
Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost.

00:42:41.31,00:42:42.94
Why are you shouting?

00:42:43.01,00:42:45.91
I'm Plog, the smith,[br]and you're Jöns, the squire.

00:42:45.98,00:42:49.11
- That's possible.[br]- Have you seen my wife?

00:42:49.19,00:42:52.25
No. But if I had seen her[br]and she was like you...

00:42:52.32,00:42:55.38
I would hasten to forget her.

00:42:57.56,00:42:59.82
So you haven't seen her?

00:42:59.90,00:43:02.92
- Maybe she's run off.[br]- Do you know something?

00:43:03.00,00:43:05.56
Quite a lot.[br]But nothing about your wife.

00:43:05.63,00:43:08.40
Go inside, they'll tell you.

00:43:28.82,00:43:33.73
The plague is raging everywhere.[br]People are dying like flies.

00:43:34.56,00:43:37.36
I can't sell anything.

00:43:40.14,00:43:44.90
It's Judgement Day.[br]And the awful omens--

00:43:48.14,00:43:51.64
A woman has given birth[br]to a calf's head.

00:43:51.71,00:43:55.58
People are mad. They flee[br]and take the plague with them.

00:43:55.65,00:43:59.38
Eat, drink and be merry!

00:44:01.99,00:44:06.02
Many have purged themselves[br]with fire and died.

00:44:06.10,00:44:11.73
But better that than hell,[br]the priests say.

00:44:14.94,00:44:19.60
No one dares say it aloud,[br]but this is the End.

00:44:19.68,00:44:21.94
People are crazy with fear.

00:44:22.01,00:44:23.91
You're scared yourself!

00:44:23.98,00:44:26.64
I'll warrant I am.

00:44:26.72,00:44:30.48
Judgement Day.

00:44:30.55,00:44:34.51
The angels descend[br]and the graves will open.

00:44:34.59,00:44:36.99
It will be horrible.

00:44:40.83,00:44:43.59
Want this? You can have it cheap.

00:44:44.67,00:44:46.64
It's real silver.

00:44:46.70,00:44:49.26
Too dear for me.

00:44:49.34,00:44:52.80
Excuse me, have you seen my wife?

00:44:52.88,00:44:55.54
- Is she missing?[br]- They say she's run off.

00:44:55.61,00:44:58.05
- Run away?[br]- With an actor.

00:44:58.11,00:45:01.48
If she has such bad taste,[br]let her go.

00:45:01.55,00:45:03.35
You are right.

00:45:03.42,00:45:06.79
I thought of killing her.

00:45:06.86,00:45:09.59
Oh. Murder? That's different!

00:45:09.66,00:45:12.25
And the actor with her.

00:45:12.33,00:45:13.76
The actor?

00:45:13.83,00:45:16.26
The one she has run off with.

00:45:17.87,00:45:20.17
Dense, aren't you?

00:45:20.24,00:45:22.30
Oh, the actor!

00:45:22.37,00:45:25.47
Yes, there are far too many of them...

00:45:25.54,00:45:29.88
so you might as well kill him.

00:45:29.95,00:45:33.68
You're lying to the smith.

00:45:33.75,00:45:36.01
Me! Lying?

00:45:40.66,00:45:45.79
You're an actor too, and it's[br]your friend who has taken his wife.

00:45:45.86,00:45:49.23
Are you an actor too?

00:45:50.90,00:45:52.89
Hardly.

00:45:52.97,00:45:56.13
It's logical to kill you, too.

00:45:57.64,00:45:59.11
Funny, aren't you?

00:45:59.17,00:46:02.70
Pale, aren't you?[br]Got a bad conscience?

00:46:02.78,00:46:04.27
You are funny.

00:46:04.35,00:46:07.65
Don't you think he's funny?[br]Oh, you don't?

00:46:08.85,00:46:11.62
Suppose we brand you.

00:46:14.69,00:46:17.35
What have you done with my wife?

00:46:31.74,00:46:35.73
You're not going to hurt me?

00:46:35.81,00:46:39.18
If I've offended anyone,[br]I'll go away.

00:46:42.32,00:46:45.12
Stand up and speak louder.

00:46:52.16,00:46:55.69
Stand on your head, actor!

00:47:07.14,00:47:09.77
What have you done with my wife?

00:47:12.41,00:47:14.41
Get up and dance!

00:47:14.48,00:47:16.35
I won't. I can't.

00:47:16.42,00:47:19.18
- Imitate a bear.[br]- I can't imitate a bear.

00:47:19.25,00:47:21.19
We shall see if you can.

00:48:20.75,00:48:22.88
Up again. Good bear.

00:48:23.72,00:48:25.71
I can't go on.

00:48:43.17,00:48:45.77
You remember what I said?

00:48:48.74,00:48:51.68
I always keep my word.

00:49:14.84,00:49:16.63
What's his name?

00:49:16.71,00:49:18.54
Michael.

00:49:18.61,00:49:20.10
How old is he?

00:49:20.18,00:49:22.34
Over a year.

00:49:23.58,00:49:26.17
- Big for his age.[br]- Do you think so?

00:49:28.92,00:49:33.95
- I saw your performance today.[br]- Was it bad?

00:49:34.02,00:49:37.12
You're prettier without make-up...

00:49:37.19,00:49:40.29
and that dress suits you better.

00:49:40.36,00:49:43.49
Skat has left us in the lurch.

00:49:45.37,00:49:46.86
Your husband?

00:49:48.57,00:49:50.94
No. Joseph is my husband.

00:49:53.08,00:49:55.64
So now there's only the two of us...

00:49:55.71,00:49:59.34
and we'll have to do tricks again.

00:49:59.41,00:50:00.85
You do tricks, too?

00:50:00.92,00:50:04.18
You bet.[br]Joseph is a skilful juggler.

00:50:04.25,00:50:06.72
Is Michael going to be an acrobat?

00:50:06.79,00:50:08.72
Joseph wants him to be.

00:50:08.79,00:50:10.22
But not you?

00:50:10.29,00:50:13.46
Perhaps he will be a knight!

00:50:13.53,00:50:15.90
That's not such fun either.

00:50:15.96,00:50:18.99
- No, you don't look happy.[br]- No.

00:50:19.07,00:50:21.59
Are you tired?

00:50:21.67,00:50:24.70
- Why?[br]- I'm in boring company.

00:50:24.77,00:50:28.11
- You mean your squire?[br]- No, not him.

00:50:28.18,00:50:30.84
- Who then?[br]- Myself.

00:50:32.45,00:50:34.28
Oh, I see.

00:50:34.35,00:50:36.37
Do you really?

00:50:36.45,00:50:39.28
Yes, I do quite well.

00:50:39.35,00:50:44.49
Why do people always[br]torment themselves?

00:50:46.96,00:50:50.80
Joseph! What is it? Where have you been?

00:50:52.47,00:50:55.37
Come sit here. Where have you been?

00:50:55.44,00:50:58.93
Let me look at you.

00:51:06.95,00:51:10.48
You've been drinking[br]at the tavern.

00:51:12.05,00:51:15.49
Not a drop!

00:51:15.56,00:51:18.29
You sat boasting of your angels.

00:51:21.36,00:51:23.66
I never said a word about angels.

00:51:23.73,00:51:28.10
Then you were playing[br]the fool again.

00:51:28.17,00:51:30.97
It makes people angry.

00:51:31.04,00:51:33.80
Look what I've brought you.

00:51:39.98,00:51:41.92
Oh, but you shouldn't!

00:51:41.98,00:51:43.54
I did, anyway.

00:51:47.99,00:51:51.08
Oh, how they hit me.

00:51:51.16,00:51:53.15
Why didn't you hit back?

00:51:53.23,00:51:55.36
I got angry...

00:51:55.43,00:51:57.56
but I never got to that.

00:51:57.63,00:52:02.23
I was so angry,[br]I roared like a lion.

00:52:02.30,00:52:04.24
Were they frightened?

00:52:04.31,00:52:06.30
No, they only laughed.

00:52:22.32,00:52:24.26
Doesn't he smell nice?

00:52:24.33,00:52:26.95
And he's so big. Aren't you?

00:52:27.03,00:52:29.05
He's got a real acrobat's body.

00:52:30.53,00:52:34.40
This is my husband, Joseph.

00:52:35.87,00:52:38.36
Good evening.

00:52:38.44,00:52:42.04
I was just saying[br]what a fine son you have.

00:52:42.11,00:52:44.98
Yes, he's fine.

00:52:45.05,00:52:47.95
- Have we nothing to offer our guest?[br]- Thank you, nothing for me.

00:52:50.55,00:52:53.82
Wild strawberries[br]and fresh milk.

00:52:55.39,00:52:59.02
We shall be honoured if you will share[br]our humble meal.

00:52:59.09,00:53:01.15
Sit down and I'll get it.

00:53:02.56,00:53:04.40
Here you are.

00:53:04.47,00:53:07.77
- Where are you making for now?[br]- To Elsinore.

00:53:07.84,00:53:11.93
- I advise you not to go that way.[br]- Why?

00:53:12.01,00:53:14.57
The plague is worse in the south.

00:53:14.64,00:53:16.58
Thousands are dying.

00:53:17.88,00:53:20.40
It never rains but it pours.

00:53:20.48,00:53:23.08
Come with me through the forest.

00:53:23.15,00:53:27.52
You'll be safer at my castle.

00:53:27.59,00:53:31.32
The strawberries[br]are from the hillside.

00:53:31.39,00:53:35.85
I've never seen ones so big.[br]Smell them.

00:53:37.70,00:53:39.72
I wish you appetite, sir.

00:53:39.80,00:53:42.33
My humble thanks.

00:53:42.40,00:53:46.24
I must think over your proposal.

00:53:46.31,00:53:49.44
It would be nice to have company.

00:53:49.51,00:53:53.97
The forest is full of evil spirits[br]and robbers.

00:53:54.05,00:53:57.61
Yes, but I must think it over.

00:53:57.69,00:53:59.88
I'm responsible for the troupe now.

00:54:01.29,00:54:04.38
After all, I am the director.

00:54:04.46,00:54:09.06
"After all, I am the director."

00:54:12.47,00:54:15.80
- Would you like some strawberries?[br]- That man has saved my life.

00:54:15.87,00:54:18.67
Sit down.

00:54:18.74,00:54:21.87
The knight's squire is honoured.

00:54:23.55,00:54:25.57
Oh, how lovely.

00:54:25.65,00:54:28.12
For a little while.

00:54:29.35,00:54:31.75
No, always. One day is like another.

00:54:31.82,00:54:34.25
That's not strange, is it?

00:54:34.32,00:54:38.95
Summer is better than winter[br]because you aren't cold.

00:54:39.03,00:54:41.00
But spring is best of all.

00:54:41.06,00:54:43.39
I've written a song about the spring.

00:54:43.47,00:54:46.40
Would you like to hear it?

00:54:46.47,00:54:49.06
Our guest may not care for your songs.

00:54:49.14,00:54:52.33
- Oh, yes. I write songs myself.[br]- You see!

00:54:52.41,00:54:56.54
There's one about an enormous fish[br]which you haven't heard.

00:54:56.61,00:54:59.81
And you're not going[br]to hear it either.

00:54:59.88,00:55:04.91
Some people don't appreciate art,[br]so I won't bore you. I'm sensitive.

00:55:09.22,00:55:11.72
We worry about so much.

00:55:11.79,00:55:15.52
It's better to be two.[br]Have you no one?

00:55:15.60,00:55:17.86
- I had once.[br]- And now?

00:55:17.93,00:55:20.09
I don't know.

00:55:20.17,00:55:23.76
So solemn! Was she your beloved?

00:55:23.84,00:55:28.07
We were newly-married.[br]We played and laughed.

00:55:29.34,00:55:32.64
I wrote songs to her eyes.

00:55:35.95,00:55:41.36
We hunted, we danced,[br]the house was full of life.

00:55:41.42,00:55:43.41
Will you have some strawberries?

00:55:45.23,00:55:48.32
To believe is to suffer.

00:55:48.40,00:55:51.16
It is like loving someone[br]in the dark...

00:55:51.23,00:55:54.23
who never answers.

00:55:56.67,00:56:00.80
How unreal that is in your company.

00:56:02.88,00:56:05.71
It means nothing to me now.

00:56:06.75,00:56:08.74
You're not so solemn now.

00:56:10.72,00:56:13.65
I shall remember this hour[br]of peace...

00:56:16.73,00:56:19.72
the strawberries,[br]the bowl of milk...

00:56:22.00,00:56:25.33
your faces in the dusk.

00:56:25.40,00:56:29.30
Michael asleep,[br]Joseph with his lute.

00:56:30.64,00:56:34.17
I shall remember our words...

00:56:34.24,00:56:38.54
and shall bear this memory[br]between my hands...

00:56:38.61,00:56:43.02
as carefully as a bowl of fresh milk.

00:56:49.22,00:56:52.68
And this will be a sign...

00:56:52.76,00:56:55.42
and a great content.

00:57:29.66,00:57:31.10
I have been waiting.

00:57:33.17,00:57:36.73
Forgive me. I was delayed.

00:57:36.81,00:57:40.71
As I have given away my strategy,[br]I beat a retreat.

00:57:40.78,00:57:44.18
Here, it is your turn.

00:57:44.25,00:57:45.84
Why so pleased?

00:57:45.91,00:57:48.25
That is my secret.

00:57:48.32,00:57:50.28
Of course.

00:57:50.99,00:57:52.92
I take your knight.

00:57:52.99,00:57:55.46
As you were meant to.

00:57:56.56,00:57:59.32
Have you tricked me?

00:57:59.39,00:58:03.16
You fell into the trap.[br]Check!

00:58:04.63,00:58:06.57
Why do you laugh?

00:58:06.64,00:58:09.83
Never mind. Save your king.

00:58:09.90,00:58:12.03
You are sure of yourself.

00:58:12.11,00:58:14.23
Our game amuses me.

00:58:15.58,00:58:18.81
Your move. I am in a hurry.

00:58:18.88,00:58:21.31
I know you have much to do...

00:58:21.38,00:58:24.78
but our game must go on.

00:58:24.85,00:58:30.42
You are escorting Joseph[br]and his family tonight?

00:58:36.36,00:58:38.30
Why do you ask?

00:58:40.10,00:58:41.53
No reason.

00:58:51.45,00:58:53.57
Have you seen Jöns?[br]We must go.

00:58:53.65,00:58:56.45
I think he's inside.

00:58:59.85,00:59:02.82
Well, if it isn't the smith!

00:59:05.33,00:59:07.79
Sitting alone and crying?

00:59:07.86,00:59:12.89
Yowling like a drowning cat.

00:59:12.97,00:59:16.03
- Is it still your wife?[br]- Yes, I haven't found her.

00:59:16.10,00:59:19.34
It's hell with women[br]and hell without.

00:59:19.41,00:59:23.04
Best to kill them[br]while the fun lasts.

00:59:23.11,00:59:25.64
Nagging and pig's swill.

00:59:25.71,00:59:27.34
Babies wetting themselves.

00:59:27.42,00:59:29.98
Scratches and abuse.

00:59:30.05,00:59:32.68
A witch for a mother-in-law.

00:59:32.75,00:59:35.31
And when you get into bed--

00:59:35.39,00:59:36.91
A new song.

00:59:36.99,00:59:40.79
Tears and whining.

00:59:40.86,00:59:44.46
- "Why don't you kiss me?"[br]- "Why don't you sing?"

00:59:44.53,00:59:46.76
"You don't love me any longer!"

00:59:46.84,00:59:49.36
"You haven't seen my new dress!"

00:59:49.44,00:59:53.13
- "All you do is snore!"[br]- Oh, hell.

00:59:53.21,00:59:57.17
Oh, hell. And now she's gone.[br]Good riddance!

00:59:59.98,01:00:03.51
I'll twist their noses[br]with tongs.

01:00:07.79,01:00:12.25
I'll crack their skulls[br]on the anvil.

01:00:14.76,01:00:17.36
He's blubbing again.

01:00:17.43,01:00:19.37
Perhaps I love her.

01:00:19.43,01:00:23.10
Perhaps! Listen,[br]you greasy cuckold.

01:00:23.17,01:00:27.44
Love is nothing but lust[br]and cheating and lies.

01:00:31.81,01:00:34.34
It hurts all the same.

01:00:35.95,01:00:37.88
Love is the blackest[br]of all plagues.

01:00:37.95,01:00:42.36
But you don't even die of it,[br]and usually it passes.

01:00:42.42,01:00:44.91
No, mine isn't passing.

01:00:44.99,01:00:47.26
Of course it will.

01:00:47.33,01:00:50.56
Only fools die of love.

01:00:52.07,01:00:56.94
If everything is imperfect[br]in this world...

01:00:57.01,01:01:00.37
love is perfect in its imperfection.

01:01:01.01,01:01:04.67
You're lucky.

01:01:04.75,01:01:07.41
You believe[br]in your own twaddle.

01:01:07.48,01:01:10.04
Who says I believe it?

01:01:10.12,01:01:13.09
But I like giving advice.

01:01:13.15,01:01:15.32
I'm a man of learning.

01:01:18.16,01:01:20.65
Can I come with you?

01:01:20.73,01:01:24.86
They only laugh at me at home.

01:01:26.43,01:01:29.20
As long as you don't blubber.[br]If you do, we'll run away.

01:01:41.82,01:01:44.18
Little brother!

01:01:44.25,01:01:48.21
Look out, Jöns![br]He wants to fight.

01:01:48.29,01:01:51.82
- Well, now he's crying.[br]- I'm sorry if I hurt you.

01:01:51.89,01:01:54.99
I've got such a confounded temper.

01:02:00.84,01:02:02.83
Come to my arms!

01:02:02.90,01:02:06.17
Later perhaps.[br]We're in a hurry.

01:03:00.13,01:03:04.06
Who is that over there[br]if not my lady...

01:03:05.60,01:03:09.13
complete with actor!

01:03:31.83,01:03:33.79
Look out now!

01:03:33.86,01:03:38.09
It is the filthy smith,[br]who has insulted...

01:03:38.17,01:03:40.57
the fair Kunigunda.

01:03:40.64,01:03:42.30
What did you call her?

01:03:42.37,01:03:44.84
Kunigunda! Are you deaf?

01:03:46.51,01:03:50.74
Her name is Lisa. Strumpet-Lisa.[br]Rump-Lisa.

01:03:53.98,01:03:55.47
How coarse he is.

01:03:55.55,01:04:01.15
Or find something better,[br]you gilded pimp!

01:04:01.22,01:04:02.45
What a brute!

01:04:02.52,01:04:06.08
You scabby bastard,[br]if I were in your lousy rags...

01:04:06.16,01:04:08.56
I would be so ashamed...

01:04:08.63,01:04:13.03
that I would creep[br]into a hole and die.

01:04:17.04,01:04:19.40
Watch out, you--

01:04:19.47,01:04:22.53
Dung heap.

01:04:22.61,01:04:26.64
Dung heap, or I'll...

01:04:26.71,01:04:31.01
blow you down to hell,[br]and you can--

01:04:33.55,01:04:34.99
Juggle.

01:04:35.86,01:04:40.09
Juggle with Old Nick's guts.

01:04:40.16,01:04:41.15
Bravo, Plog!

01:04:41.23,01:04:46.13
Watch out that I don't rip open[br]your belly.

01:04:47.17,01:04:49.43
Watch out that I don't punch you[br]in the face...

01:04:49.50,01:04:53.10
so you can't perform[br]for Turks and cannibals!

01:04:54.34,01:04:57.47
Why do you laugh? It's serious.

01:04:57.55,01:05:01.95
In southern lands there are things[br]called apes.

01:05:02.02,01:05:05.14
- What about it?[br]- Nothing.

01:05:05.22,01:05:07.45
Plog, my dear little Plog.

01:05:11.23,01:05:13.79
Darling Plog, forgive me.

01:05:13.86,01:05:16.76
She'll cry in a minute.

01:05:16.83,01:05:19.80
It's all so dreadful.

01:05:19.87,01:05:23.70
He has cheated me.

01:05:23.77,01:05:27.00
Look here, Kunigunda.

01:05:27.08,01:05:30.34
It will be his favourite food next!

01:05:30.41,01:05:35.51
When we get home,[br]I'll make you pork dumplings.

01:05:40.69,01:05:44.62
I must kill him first.

01:05:47.43,01:05:51.83
Yes, kill him properly.[br]I don't like him anymore.

01:05:51.90,01:05:54.39
Lord, why did you create woman?

01:05:54.47,01:05:59.91
He's nothing but false beard,[br]false teeth...

01:05:59.97,01:06:01.91
false all over.

01:06:01.98,01:06:03.91
Kill him.

01:06:05.21,01:06:11.02
If you thought I would defend myself[br]you were wrong.

01:06:11.09,01:06:14.28
Kill me. I'll thank you afterwards!

01:06:14.36,01:06:15.79
What did you say?

01:06:15.86,01:06:19.95
The actor plays on the emotions.[br]That's half the battle.

01:06:20.03,01:06:22.12
Don't stand there gaping!

01:06:22.20,01:06:25.22
He must fight me,[br]or I can't kill him.

01:06:25.30,01:06:27.60
He must at least annoy me.

01:06:28.74,01:06:32.33
I shall plunge this dagger[br]in my heart...

01:06:33.61,01:06:38.31
and my reality will become[br]that of a corpse.

01:06:40.75,01:06:44.84
Wait! I didn't mean any harm.

01:06:44.92,01:06:47.11
I forgive you, Kunigunda.

01:06:47.19,01:06:49.12
Farewell, my friend.

01:06:49.19,01:06:51.28
Pray for me.

01:07:07.86,01:07:10.73
Oh dear, I didn't mean it like that.

01:07:10.80,01:07:14.93
Oh dear, I was beginning[br]to like him.

01:07:15.01,01:07:19.81
He's dead. The deadest actor[br]I've ever seen.

01:07:19.88,01:07:24.58
Oh well, he wanted to die.

01:07:24.65,01:07:27.01
And that's what I'm married to!

01:07:27.08,01:07:29.92
Now you've got[br]your little Lisa back.

01:07:31.12,01:07:33.52
Aren't you happy?

01:07:33.59,01:07:37.05
Jöns, between you and me,[br]isn't life--

01:07:38.63,01:07:41.83
Yes. But don't think of that now.

01:07:43.67,01:07:46.10
It's a dirty mess.

01:07:54.11,01:07:56.48
I played that scene well.

01:08:02.92,01:08:07.12
Now to find a tree[br]where I'll be safe...

01:08:07.19,01:08:09.82
from bears, wolves and ghosts.

01:08:30.98,01:08:34.21
Tomorrow I'll find Joseph[br]and Mary...

01:08:34.28,01:08:37.34
and off we go[br]to the Saints' Festival.

01:08:38.46,01:08:41.25
I'll warble like a little bird.

01:08:47.03,01:08:49.26
Workmen in the forest!

01:08:56.51,01:08:59.30
It's my tree!

01:08:59.38,01:09:03.97
Hey, you scurvy knave,[br]what are you up to?

01:09:04.05,01:09:08.61
You might at least answer.[br]Who are you?

01:09:10.02,01:09:13.79
I'm felling your tree.[br]Your time is up.

01:09:13.86,01:09:16.66
You can't. I haven't time.

01:09:16.73,01:09:18.92
You haven't time?

01:09:19.00,01:09:22.29
No, I have my performance.

01:09:22.37,01:09:25.10
Cancelled, owing to death.

01:09:25.17,01:09:28.00
- My contract?[br]- Annulled.

01:09:29.14,01:09:32.11
My family--

01:09:32.18,01:09:34.44
For shame, Skat.

01:09:34.51,01:09:36.88
Yes, I'm ashamed.

01:09:40.88,01:09:43.44
Is there no exemption for actors?

01:09:43.52,01:09:45.85
Not in your case.

01:09:47.22,01:09:50.49
No loopholes?

01:10:35.47,01:10:37.63
There's the moon.

01:10:39.64,01:10:42.74
Now we can see our way.

01:10:42.81,01:10:45.71
I don't like the moon tonight.

01:10:45.78,01:10:47.72
The trees are so still.

01:10:47.78,01:10:50.69
That's because there is no wind.

01:10:50.75,01:10:54.81
He means they're unusually still.

01:10:54.89,01:10:57.88
There's not a sound.

01:10:59.06,01:11:02.23
- If only we could hear a fox.[br]- Or an owl.

01:11:02.30,01:11:05.63
Or a human voice...

01:11:05.70,01:11:07.64
besides our own.

01:11:35.93,01:11:38.09
Where are you going?

01:11:38.17,01:11:41.86
- To the stake.[br]- Ah, yes, the witch.

01:11:41.94,01:11:45.77
Why burn her at night[br]when people need diversion?

01:11:45.84,01:11:48.44
Shut up, for God's sake.

01:11:48.51,01:11:51.21
The Devil is with her.

01:11:51.28,01:11:53.77
Then you are eight brave men.

01:11:53.85,01:11:57.91
We've been paid.[br]This is a volunteer job.

01:13:36.59,01:13:38.55
Do you hear me?

01:13:40.42,01:13:43.15
They say you've had commerce[br]with the Devil.

01:13:43.23,01:13:45.16
Why do you ask?

01:13:45.23,01:13:48.72
For very personal reasons.

01:13:50.50,01:13:52.83
I, too, want to meet him.

01:13:52.90,01:13:54.73
Why?

01:13:56.04,01:13:58.91
I must ask him about God.

01:13:58.98,01:14:00.97
Surely he knows.

01:14:04.41,01:14:07.32
You can see him any time.

01:14:07.38,01:14:08.85
How?

01:14:08.92,01:14:11.28
If you do as I say.

01:14:13.56,01:14:15.46
Look into my eyes.

01:14:18.33,01:14:22.56
Well, do you see him?

01:14:22.63,01:14:26.33
I see terror.

01:14:26.40,01:14:27.84
Nothing else.

01:14:31.61,01:14:34.54
Nothing? No one?

01:14:36.95,01:14:38.68
No.

01:14:40.38,01:14:42.72
Is he not behind you?

01:14:45.59,01:14:48.92
There is no one.

01:14:52.66,01:14:54.89
He is with me everywhere.

01:14:54.96,01:14:58.66
If I stretch out my hand,[br]I feel him.

01:14:58.74,01:15:01.23
Even now.

01:15:01.30,01:15:03.27
The fire won't hurt me.

01:15:03.34,01:15:05.31
- Has he said so?[br]- I know.

01:15:05.37,01:15:09.04
- Has he said so?[br]- I know. I know.

01:15:09.11,01:15:11.88
You must see him, too.

01:15:11.95,01:15:15.54
The priests could see him,[br]and the soldiers.

01:15:15.62,01:15:18.78
They dare not touch me.

01:15:25.13,01:15:27.10
Why have you broken her hands?

01:15:27.16,01:15:29.65
- It is not us.[br]- Who?

01:15:29.73,01:15:31.67
Ask the monk there.

01:15:33.37,01:15:35.89
What have you done to the child?

01:15:40.94,01:15:43.24
Will you never stop asking questions?

01:15:44.71,01:15:48.74
No. Never.

01:15:48.82,01:15:51.25
But you get no answer.

01:16:08.81,01:16:11.80
I did think of killing[br]the soldiers...

01:16:11.87,01:16:14.07
but she's nearly dead already.

01:16:14.14,01:16:16.81
I told you to be careful.[br]Don't go near her.

01:16:28.36,01:16:31.42
This will still the pain.

01:17:32.39,01:17:35.45
What does she see?

01:17:35.52,01:17:39.09
- She has no pain now.[br]- You don't answer.

01:17:39.16,01:17:41.60
Who will look after that child?

01:17:41.66,01:17:45.40
The angels? God? Satan?[br]Emptiness?

01:17:46.50,01:17:49.87
- No, emptiness, milord![br]- It cannot be.

01:17:49.94,01:17:51.37
Look at her eyes.

01:17:51.44,01:17:54.93
Her poor mind is making[br]a discovery.

01:17:55.01,01:17:57.14
Emptiness!

01:17:57.21,01:17:59.04
No.

01:17:59.12,01:18:01.78
We are helpless.

01:18:01.85,01:18:05.41
We see what she sees[br]and her terror is ours.

01:18:06.89,01:18:09.36
Poor child!

01:18:09.43,01:18:11.36
I can't stand it!

01:19:27.07,01:19:31.97
He sings so sweetly[br]of Jesus Christ

01:19:32.04,01:19:36.14
In heaven there is great joy

01:19:38.68,01:19:41.17
It will soon be dawn...

01:19:41.25,01:19:44.19
but the heat is stifling.

01:19:44.25,01:19:47.92
I'm so afraid.

01:19:47.99,01:19:50.29
We feel something will happen[br]to us...

01:19:50.36,01:19:53.39
but we don't know what.

01:19:53.46,01:19:55.40
Doomsday perhaps.

01:19:55.46,01:19:57.06
Doomsday.

01:20:09.25,01:20:11.04
Give me water!

01:20:13.28,01:20:14.98
I have the plague.

01:20:15.05,01:20:17.82
Keep on the other side[br]of the tree.

01:20:23.86,01:20:26.19
I am afraid to die.

01:20:26.26,01:20:29.49
I don't want to die!

01:20:34.94,01:20:37.37
Take pity on me.

01:20:39.91,01:20:42.61
Speak to me!

01:20:48.32,01:20:50.25
It is useless.

01:20:53.09,01:20:55.25
I know it is!

01:20:59.63,01:21:01.79
I am dying.

01:21:06.90,01:21:09.10
What will happen to me?

01:21:13.01,01:21:15.17
Take pity on me.

01:21:18.98,01:21:20.92
Is there no help?

01:21:23.55,01:21:25.49
It is useless.

01:21:28.39,01:21:31.72
Utterly useless!

01:21:31.79,01:21:33.46
Help me!

01:21:33.53,01:21:35.76
Do you hear? I'm consoling you.

01:22:02.36,01:22:04.79
Shall we finish our game?

01:22:05.59,01:22:07.03
Your move!

01:22:15.24,01:22:17.54
I take your queen.

01:22:17.61,01:22:19.47
I didn't see that.

01:22:35.12,01:22:37.06
I see something dreadful.

01:22:37.13,01:22:39.75
- Something I can hardly tell you.[br]- What do you see?

01:22:39.83,01:22:42.96
The knight is playing chess[br]over there.

01:22:43.03,01:22:45.59
So I see. What of it?

01:22:45.67,01:22:47.60
Don't you see who the other is?

01:22:47.67,01:22:50.57
He's alone.[br]You mustn't scare me like that.

01:22:50.64,01:22:54.37
- No, he's not alone.[br]- Who is it then?

01:22:54.44,01:22:58.04
He's playing chess with Death.

01:22:58.78,01:23:00.58
You mustn't say that.

01:23:00.65,01:23:04.31
- We must flee.[br]- Not without him.

01:23:04.39,01:23:09.05
They are so deep in their game[br]that they won't notice.

01:23:15.50,01:23:18.47
Your move, Antonius Block.

01:23:22.50,01:23:24.60
Have you lost interest?

01:23:28.11,01:23:30.01
On the contrary!

01:23:30.08,01:23:33.17
You look worried.

01:23:33.25,01:23:35.88
Are you hiding something?

01:23:35.95,01:23:38.35
Nothing escapes you.

01:23:38.42,01:23:41.55
Nothing escapes me.

01:23:41.62,01:23:43.72
No one escapes me.

01:23:45.03,01:23:47.02
I am worried, it is true.

01:23:48.46,01:23:50.40
You are afraid.

01:23:58.47,01:24:00.47
I've forgotten how[br]the pieces were.

01:24:03.11,01:24:05.17
But I have not.

01:24:06.68,01:24:09.17
You can't get off so easily!

01:24:17.96,01:24:20.86
- Ah, how interesting.[br]- What do you see?

01:24:23.40,01:24:25.56
You are mate at the next move.

01:24:29.41,01:24:30.70
True.

01:24:32.68,01:24:34.67
Did you gain by the delay?

01:24:34.74,01:24:37.34
Yes.

01:24:38.18,01:24:41.31
I am glad.

01:24:41.38,01:24:43.82
When next we meet...

01:24:43.89,01:24:48.12
the hour will strike[br]for you and your friends.

01:24:52.33,01:24:54.39
And you will reveal your secrets.

01:24:55.36,01:24:57.39
I have no secrets.

01:24:57.47,01:25:00.59
So you know nothing?

01:25:01.50,01:25:03.23
I am unknowing.

01:25:26.53,01:25:28.86
What a queer light!

01:25:28.93,01:25:31.83
It's the thunderstorm.

01:25:31.90,01:25:34.66
No. It's something terrible.

01:25:34.74,01:25:36.67
Do you hear the roar?

01:25:36.74,01:25:38.71
It's only the rain.

01:25:41.21,01:25:43.74
No. He has seen us.

01:25:43.81,01:25:45.75
He's chasing us.

01:25:59.66,01:26:02.26
Inside, Mary! Quick!

01:26:08.50,01:26:11.10
The Angel of Doom[br]is rushing past...

01:26:11.17,01:26:14.90
and he is very big.

01:26:14.98,01:26:16.91
How cold it is!

01:28:20.57,01:28:24.27
I heard you were coming home...

01:28:25.54,01:28:27.60
so I waited for you.

01:28:27.68,01:28:29.84
The others have fled[br]from the plague.

01:28:36.75,01:28:39.28
Don't you know me anymore?

01:28:44.03,01:28:46.49
You too have changed.

01:28:53.67,01:28:56.14
Now I can see it is you.

01:28:57.57,01:29:00.54
Hidden deep in your eyes...

01:29:07.38,01:29:11.68
is the boy who went away[br]so long ago.

01:29:14.29,01:29:18.69
It is over now and I am tired.

01:29:18.76,01:29:21.35
Are you sorry you went?

01:29:21.43,01:29:25.30
No. But I am tired.

01:29:33.41,01:29:35.34
I can see that.

01:29:43.52,01:29:45.75
Over there are my friends.

01:29:48.66,01:29:52.56
Ask them in.[br]I shall prepare a meal.

01:29:57.83,01:30:01.83
"And when the Lamb had opened[br]the seventh seal...

01:30:01.90,01:30:06.17
"there was silence in heaven...

01:30:06.24,01:30:09.21
"about the space of half an hour.

01:30:10.51,01:30:13.04
"And the seven angels...

01:30:13.12,01:30:16.05
"which had the seven trumpets...

01:30:16.12,01:30:20.08
"prepared themselves to sound.

01:30:31.63,01:30:36.07
"The first angel sounded,[br]and there followed...

01:30:36.14,01:30:40.67
"hail and fire mingled with blood...

01:30:40.74,01:30:44.23
"and they were cast upon the earth.

01:30:49.22,01:30:53.42
"And the third part of the trees[br]was burnt up...

01:30:54.56,01:30:59.15
"and all the green grass was burnt up.

01:30:59.23,01:31:03.43
"And the second angel sounded...

01:31:04.73,01:31:09.10
"and as it were a great mountain[br]burning with fire...

01:31:09.17,01:31:12.23
"was cast into the sea.

01:31:12.31,01:31:16.68
"And the third part of the sea[br]became blood."

01:31:16.75,01:31:18.30
Was anyone there?

01:31:23.99,01:31:26.65
No, milord. I saw no one.

01:31:30.79,01:31:34.28
"And the third angel sounded...

01:31:37.07,01:31:41.97
"and there fell a great star[br]from heaven...

01:31:42.04,01:31:46.00
"burning as if it were a lamp.

01:31:46.07,01:31:50.91
"And the name of the star[br]is called Wormwood."

01:32:26.65,01:32:29.01
Good morning, noble lord.

01:32:30.65,01:32:34.32
I am Karin, the knight's wife...

01:32:34.39,01:32:37.09
and I bid you welcome in my house.

01:32:38.86,01:32:41.66
I'm a smith by trade...

01:32:41.73,01:32:44.72
and not a bad one.

01:32:44.80,01:32:47.83
My wife Lisa.

01:32:47.90,01:32:50.53
Curtsy to the noble lord, Lisa.

01:32:52.11,01:32:55.08
Takes a bit of handling...

01:32:55.14,01:32:58.94
but we quarrel no worse[br]than others.

01:33:00.28,01:33:03.91
Out of our darkness,[br]we call to Thee, O Lord!

01:33:03.99,01:33:07.32
Oh, God, have mercy on us!

01:33:07.39,01:33:10.88
We are small and afraid[br]and without knowledge.

01:33:10.96,01:33:13.66
In the darkness[br]where you say you are...

01:33:13.73,01:33:18.53
there is none to listen to your lament.

01:33:21.57,01:33:24.73
You are reflected[br]in your own indifference.

01:33:24.81,01:33:30.21
God, you who are somewhere,[br]who must be somewhere...

01:33:30.28,01:33:32.47
have mercy on us!

01:33:32.55,01:33:35.48
I could have purged your worries[br]about eternity...

01:33:35.55,01:33:37.48
but now it's too late.

01:33:37.55,01:33:42.58
But feel, to the very end,[br]the triumph of being alive!

01:33:42.66,01:33:45.13
Quiet, quiet!

01:33:45.19,01:33:48.19
Yes, but under protest.

01:34:09.72,01:34:11.88
It is finished.

01:35:06.41,01:35:08.57
I see them, Mary!

01:35:10.45,01:35:13.57
Over there against the stormy sky.

01:35:13.65,01:35:15.84
They are all there.

01:35:15.92,01:35:18.39
The smith and Lisa,[br]the knight...

01:35:18.45,01:35:21.32
Raval, Jöns, and Skat.

01:35:21.39,01:35:25.19
And the strict master Death[br]bids them dance.

01:35:26.29,01:35:28.99
He wants them to hold hands...

01:35:29.06,01:35:32.80
and to tread the dance[br]in a long line.

01:35:32.87,01:35:35.03
At the head goes the strict master...

01:35:35.10,01:35:37.59
with the scythe and hourglass.

01:35:37.67,01:35:41.13
But the Fool brings up the rear[br]with his lute.

01:35:42.48,01:35:46.81
They move away from the dawn...

01:35:46.88,01:35:49.44
in a solemn dance...

01:35:49.52,01:35:52.42
away towards the dark lands...

01:35:52.49,01:35:56.05
while the rain cleanses[br]their cheeks...

01:35:56.12,01:35:59.92
of the salt[br]from their bitter tears.

01:36:04.07,01:36:06.76
You with your visions!
