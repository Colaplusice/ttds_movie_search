1
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:35,056
Tommy?

2
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:38,915
Jesus!

3
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:46,044
Whatre you doing here?

4
00:02:47,842 --> 00:02:49,293
I was just passing through.

5
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,703
And I figured,
why not have a belt with the old man.

6
00:02:58,342 --> 00:02:59,793
She looks good.

7
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:01,198
Yeah,

8
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:03,506
shes hanging in there.

9
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:07,175
Well, you always did take good care of her.

10
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,217
Paddy Conlon.

11
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:13,987
Man of priorities.

12
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:24,051
Got a little something for ya.

13
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:28,473
Mom always said,
never go anywhere empty handed.

14
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,474
She did.

15
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:32,869
But thats not for me anymore, Tommy.

16
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:39,364
You change brands?

17
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:43,967
lets go inside, huh.

18
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:47,129
Tommy...

19
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:50,064
Cmon, lets go inside.

22
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:14,877
I like what youve done with the place.

23
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:17,834
-  Appreciate that.

24
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,081
- Theres not much of a womans touch around here.

25
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,640
- No more women for me, Tommy.

26
00:04:30,152 --> 00:04:31,113
Yeah...

27
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:35,226
Must be hard to find a girl
who can take a punch nowadays.

28
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:43,600
- Here you go.

29
00:04:46,425 --> 00:04:47,384
- Coffee?

30
00:04:50,216 --> 00:04:52,701
You havent seen a guy in 14 years
and youre not gonna have a drink with him?

31
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:54,988
- I told you, Im off it. Tommy.

32
00:04:55,023 --> 00:04:57,356
Im coming up on a thousand days.

33
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,997
- Cmon,
just a drink.

34
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:03,998
- No.

35
00:05:31,593 --> 00:05:33,291
Hes a school teacher down in Philly.

36
00:05:36,063 --> 00:05:37,174
Remember Tess?

37
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,753
Theyve got two beautiful little girls.

38
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:09,395
So you found God, huh?
Thats awesome.

39
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,136
Mom kept calling for him,
but he wasnt around.

40
00:06:16,828 --> 00:06:19,227
I guess Jesus was down at the mill
forgiving all  the drunks. Huh?

41
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,082
Who knew?

42
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,068
So, you gonna ask about her,

43
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,594
or you just gonna sit there all sober?

44
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,643
I know.

45
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:39,089
Oh, you know?
What do you know?

46
00:06:41,214 --> 00:06:43,732
Do you know it wasnt enough just to
drive west to get away from you?

47
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:46,089
Once, we hit the water we drove north, too.

48
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:49,731
- When I got sober
I hired a man to find you.

49
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,677
- Is that one of the 12 steps?

50
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:55,744
Or does a guy like you get 24?

51
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,257
- Just the 12.

52
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:08,259
- Did your guy tell you
what you needed to know?

53
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:12,075
- Just that your mother died in Tacoma.

54
00:07:14,177 --> 00:07:15,634
And you were in the Marines.

55
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,298
That was all.
That was enough.

56
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:26,107
- Well, Thats too bad.

57
00:07:27,678 --> 00:07:29,857
You couldve gotten some good details.

58
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:38,081
You couldve heard about her coughing up blood
on her kness,in a shit box with no heat.

59
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:42,226
Having me rub her down with holy water,

60
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:45,735
because she didnt have no insurance.

61
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:50,342
All the time.. waiting for your pal Jesus to save her.

62
00:07:52,913 --> 00:07:54,365
Did your man tell you that?

63
00:07:58,682 --> 00:08:00,083
- Im sorry, Tommy.

64
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:10,714
- Well, Its good to know youre sorry, Pop.

65
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,822
It goes a long way.

66
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:23,955
I think I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

67
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:53,013
Whats going on over here?

68
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:58,106
Well, Im not sure,
but I think Daddy is now a princess.

69
00:08:58,107 --> 00:09:00,510
- Daddy, you look so handsome.

70
00:09:00,545 --> 00:09:01,570
- Do I?

71
00:09:09,743 --> 00:09:10,984
You want to open your presents?

72
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,548
This an awfully big box.

73
00:09:34,912 --> 00:09:36,037
Its her birthday.

74
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:37,038
I know,

75
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,624
but thats why you call it a budget.
You set it, and you dont budge.

76
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:54,875
Hey babe, Im late.

77
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,953
Moms saying goodbye to the girls.

78
00:09:56,988 --> 00:10:00,361
Shes gotta get on the road. Theyve been fed.
They just need a bath.

79
00:10:00,396 --> 00:10:01,578
Im on it.

80
00:10:01,613 --> 00:10:03,864
Can you get them in bed
at a reasonable time tonight?

81
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,865
After the party,
Theyre exhausted.

82
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:06,866
- Where's the rest of that skirt?

83
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:07,867
Babe.

84
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,385
Listen, if any guys give you a hassle in that joint tonight
you give me a call, okay?

85
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:16,145
- Yeah. Just like you gave me a call
when those Temple frat boys decided to smash up your face.

86
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:19,080
I told you, most nights
I sit on the stool and grade papers,

87
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:21,881
but every now and then
I need some action.

88
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:26,065
- Alright, well wait up for me tonight.
Ill see what I can do about that.

89
00:10:27,557 --> 00:10:28,895
- Promises, promises.

Ive always been incredibly passionate about.</i>

95
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:53,366
<i>As for where the idea for Sparta came from,</i>

96

- Hows it work?

109
00:11:29,864 --> 00:11:31,150
- Thirty five a month with locker.

110
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,598
Were open at 7, lights out at 11.

111
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,206
- So, You wanna join?

112
00:11:37,241 --> 00:11:38,909
- Sure.

113
00:11:40,928 --> 00:11:42,618
- Put your name and contact info on the card.

114
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:47,115
- Thank you.

115
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,724
Whoa whoa whoa!
Theres a lesson in this too, OK?

116
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:04,213
So we have a body at rest,

117
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:06,585
and you have the bat which needs--

118
00:12:06,586 --> 00:12:07,586
Acceleration.

119
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:08,587
Acceleration, okay.

120
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:09,588
If you have enough acceleration,

121
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:12,812
you might have a chance
to break the body at rest.

122
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:25,883
Alright, There we go.

123
00:12:32,694 --> 00:12:33,798
Dial it down.

124
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:36,881
So, have we got it?

125
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,772
Force equals mass times acceleration.

126
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:39,716
We got it.

127
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,982
Alright. The third law--

128
00:12:44,983 --> 00:12:47,114
How many laws this dude got?

129
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:48,319
- The dude?
- Yes, the dude.

130
00:12:48,354 --> 00:12:50,634
The dude has three.

131
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:58,999
Newton the dude says that
for every action, theres an equal and opposite reaction.

132
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:01,234
For example,

133
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:05,505
if KC does not stop the action
of sending texts in class...

134
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,151
...and tell her posse outside to beat it...

135
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:11,583
...then my reaction might be to
send her down to Principal Zitos office.

136
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:14,141
Thus setting our world back..

137
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:15,909
in proper balance.

138
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,910
Mr. C, I put it away.

139
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:20,361
Alright, before you go,

140
00:13:20,396 --> 00:13:22,366
I have your tests from last week.

141
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,110

00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,771
We got a tournament coming up. You
gonna kill every guy in the Burgh?

143
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,881
Fenroy. Get me some ice.

144
00:14:06,703 --> 00:14:08,787
And call that Puerto Rican kid, the one that
fights outa the Bottoms.

145
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:11,119
If hes here in 20 minutes,
he gets 200 bucks.

146
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
Yo, Ill fight him.

147
00:14:13,537 --> 00:14:14,496
Do me a favor guy,
go back to your bag.

148
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:16,346
We dont need anybody else getting hurt.

149
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:17,466
Take a walk.

150
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,320
Yo Rock, What did you do?
Did you leave Mick and Paulie at home today?

151
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:30,728
His phones disconnected.

152
00:14:30,729 --> 00:14:31,729
Then go through the list.
find me somebody.

153
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,730
Get me Joe Bones.

154
00:14:32,731 --> 00:14:35,180
All Im saying is...

155
00:14:35,215 --> 00:14:36,893
if you need somebody to help you,

156
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:39,581
Im happy to keep your boy warm for you.

157
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:53,332
You ever fought before?

158
00:14:54,564 --> 00:14:55,982
Yeah.

159
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,787
This guy sign a waiver?

160
00:14:59,788 --> 00:15:00,788
All good.

161
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,681
Whats your name?

162
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:07,597
Tommy.

163
00:15:08,764 --> 00:15:10,284
You get tuned up in here, its on you, Tommy.

164
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,285
Sure, no problem.

165
00:15:13,827 --> 00:15:15,129
Come on in.

166
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:29,174
Gonna be a hero? Alright.

167
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:29,159
You owe me two hundred bucks.

168
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,165
This one here.

169
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,455
See, this is the new appraisal figure,
as they came in.

170
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,498
As you can see, that's just the way it is,
that puts you upside down .

171
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:01,071
Thats the problem. Its the country
that did the assessment, not the bank.

172
00:17:01,072 --> 00:17:04,338
So, the numbers are
what they are, Mr. Conlon.

173
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,339
- Brendan.

174
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,340
The numbers are what they are, Brendan.

175
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:08,456
I mean, youre a Math teacher,
you can appreciate that.

176
00:17:08,457 --> 00:17:10,940
Physics teacher.
I teach Physics.

177
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:11,941
Physics. OK.

178
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:14,551
But the bank has got
to go by the new appraisal figures,

179
00:17:14,552 --> 00:17:15,552
According to these figures,

180
00:17:15,553 --> 00:17:17,502
youre upside down on your mortgage--

181
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,503
You said that three times.

182
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,307
I get that.

183
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:23,365
But Im asking you if
theres something else you can do.

184
00:17:24,688 --> 00:17:25,729
Not the bank, you.

185
00:17:25,764 --> 00:17:27,604
Can you shift things around, restructure--

186
00:17:27,605 --> 00:17:29,582
- Well, youve already refinanced twice.
Already,

187
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,583
- Because you advised us to do that.

188
00:17:32,597 --> 00:17:34,016
I presented you with that option.

189
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:35,488
That was your choice.

190
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:39,695
Im also showing you netted a
substantial payout with the refi.

191
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:42,031
- We had that conversation.

192
00:17:43,735 --> 00:17:47,206
I was paying medical bills.
Is that in your file?

193
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:50,138
Oh, right. Sorry.
Your daughters...kidney?

194
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:51,139
- Heart.

195
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,904
- Heart, right.
Sorry.

196
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,905
Lot of stories.

197
00:17:57,145 --> 00:18:00,959
So my option is Ive got no options?
Youre not even gonna try to help me?

198
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
- I am trying..

199
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:04,869
Look, I can get you 90 days to get even--

200
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,870
- 90 days is not enough.

201
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:10,000
My wife and I have three jobs between us;

202
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,727
and that doesnt cut it.

203
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:15,997
So, what do you suggest?

204
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:18,408
Let me ask you a question:

205
00:18:18,443 --> 00:18:19,842
Have you thought aboutbankruptcy?

206
00:18:21,087 --> 00:18:22,215
Its a viable option.

207
00:18:23,506 --> 00:18:24,898
Theres no shame in it these days.

208
00:18:30,387 --> 00:18:31,592
- Thats not how I do things.

209
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,399
- Well, then youre looking at foreclosure.

210
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:50,299
<i> TV- ANNOUNCER #1: Utter domination by Tommy Conlon,

00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:04,266

223
00:19:22,233 --> 00:19:23,184
How you doin, sir?

224
00:19:23,185 --> 00:19:24,185
Im looking for Tommy Riordan.

225
00:19:24,186 --> 00:19:25,186
- Who?

226
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:28,303
- Tommy Riordan?
My names Colt Boyd.

227
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:32,709
- What business you got with Tommy?

228
00:19:32,744 --> 00:19:33,949
- None yet.

229
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:36,102
Thats why Im here. I manage fighters.

230
00:19:39,006 --> 00:19:40,590
Tommys been working out at my gym.

231
00:19:43,763 --> 00:19:46,471
He put a beating on the number one
middleweight contender in the world today.

232
00:19:48,731 --> 00:19:50,236
I want to know more about the guy.

233
00:19:50,237 --> 00:19:51,237
Maybe help him out.

234
00:19:53,213 --> 00:19:54,697
I have a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan.

235
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:57,897
- Conlon. Names Conlon.

236
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:02,941
And anything you want to know about Tommy,
you gotta ask him yourself.

237
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:05,609
- Look, Im just asking for
some general information here.

238
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,066
- Like I said,
anything you want to know about Tommy,

239
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:09,067
you gotta ask him yourself.

240
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:11,360
- Look, I dont mean to interrupt your night. Okay?

241
00:20:11,395 --> 00:20:13,567
He just put this address down
when he signed up at the gym.

242
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:14,568
- He doesnt live here.

243
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:18,648
- Alright then.

244
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:19,976
- Goodnight.

245
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:31,244
Listen kiddo,
I need you put Mommy back on, OK?

246
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:33,554
I love you.

247
00:20:34,702 --> 00:20:36,517
Hey, listen...Im just pulling in.
I'm gonna have to go.

248
00:20:39,153 --> 00:20:42,664
Huh? Oh, theyve got this open mic night thing.

249
00:20:42,665 --> 00:20:43,665
It's gonna be a quiet one.

250
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,242
Sleep well.

251
00:20:48,211 --> 00:20:49,422

<i>Let's do it!</i>

269
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:19,134
How was work?

270
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,770
Oh my God.

271
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,580
What happened?

272
00:24:31,255 --> 00:24:32,555
You said it was going to be a slow night.

273
00:24:36,428 --> 00:24:37,830
Im not bouncing at a club.

274
00:24:41,402 --> 00:24:42,913
What do you mean youre not bouncing?

275
00:25:02,446 --> 00:25:03,793
Youve been lying to me?

276
00:25:07,895 --> 00:25:08,934
I went in to apply.

277
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:15,019
They were only paying nine bucks an hour.

278
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:24,556
Then I saw a sign for this other thing.

279
00:25:32,187 --> 00:25:33,711
Theyre putting us out of the house in three months,
were running out of options--

280
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:36,652
Then theyll put us out of the house in three months.

281
00:25:36,653 --> 00:25:40,238
Id rather go back to the old apartment than
see you in the back of an ambulance again.

282
00:25:42,383 --> 00:25:44,780
I thought we agreed that
we werent going to raise our children in

283
00:25:44,781 --> 00:25:48,526
a family where
their father gets beat up for a living.

284
00:25:52,327 --> 00:25:53,578
Were not giving up the house.

285
00:25:55,031 --> 00:25:56,076
This is our home.

286
00:25:58,085 --> 00:25:59,274
Were not going backwards.

287
00:26:13,002 --> 00:26:14,302
Well figure it out.

288
00:26:17,004 --> 00:26:18,830
But this is what were not going back to.

289
00:27:17,627 --> 00:27:18,954
You wanted to talk?

290
00:27:21,297 --> 00:27:22,189
- Yeah.

291
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:26,297
Im gonna start fighting.

292
00:27:27,852 --> 00:27:28,875
- Is that right?

293
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,865
- Dont play babe in the woods with me.
I know that guy from the gym came to see you.

294
00:27:31,866 --> 00:27:34,849
- Colt Boyd? yeah..

295
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,256
I didnt tell him anything, Tommy.

296
00:27:37,257 --> 00:27:39,834
We wouldnt be sitting
here now if you did.

297
00:27:39,835 --> 00:27:42,912
Waiter: Paddy, can I get you more coffee?
- No, thank you.

298
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:50,073
Alright. Look.

299
00:27:50,074 --> 00:27:51,074
Theres this tournament.

300
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,279
It's a big tournament.

301
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,904
Top sixteen middleweights in the world.

302
00:27:56,905 --> 00:27:57,905
Single elimination.

303
00:27:57,906 --> 00:28:01,377
Winner take all for a lot of money.

304
00:28:03,536 --> 00:28:05,069
Im gonna do that.

305
00:28:07,211 --> 00:28:08,745
But if Im doin it,

306
00:28:08,746 --> 00:28:13,563
then Im gonna need a trainer.

307
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:17,313
Now that much you were good at.

308
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:22,520
No, no, no.

309
00:28:22,555 --> 00:28:24,066
This doesnt mean anything..okay?

310
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:25,067
Im serious.

311
00:28:26,848 --> 00:28:28,656
We train. Thats it.

312
00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:31,389
I dont wanna hear
a word about anything but training,

313
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,390
...you understand?

314
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:34,849
You wanna tell your war stories,

315
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,850
you can take em down to the VFW.

316
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:38,611
You can take em to a meeting,

317
00:28:38,646 --> 00:28:42,178
or church, or wherever
the hell it is you go nowadays.

318
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,684
- What about Colt Boyd?

319
00:28:44,685 --> 00:28:46,957
- What about him? I told him
I dont train with people I dont know.

320
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,851
- Ah, the devil you know.
- Excuse me?

321
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:53,290
- The devil you know is better than
the devil you dont.

322
00:28:56,802 --> 00:28:58,074
- Yeah.

323
00:29:03,361 --> 00:29:07,169
Chasing Theogenes.
Itll be kinda like old times.

324
00:29:08,153 --> 00:29:10,478
- I just told you,
this doesnt mean anything.

325
00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:14,730
Now, get that through your skull
right now or Im walking.

326
00:29:14,731 --> 00:29:15,731
Alright. Alright.

327
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:19,517
But you get something through your skull, too.

328
00:29:19,518 --> 00:29:20,518
You called me.

329
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:23,890
So dont go threatening
to walk every five minutes!

330
00:29:25,988 --> 00:29:27,627
And since this is about training,

331
00:29:27,628 --> 00:29:31,995
you dump whatever it is you need to dump
as far as those  pills are concerned.

332
00:29:31,996 --> 00:29:32,996
I dont want to see em.

333
00:29:34,838 --> 00:29:36,579
In fact, hand em over right now.

334
00:29:39,768 --> 00:29:41,216
I know theyre on you, Tommy.

335
00:29:41,217 --> 00:29:44,514
You sounded like a goddamn maraca
coming through the door.

336
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,109
Thats not gonna do.

337
00:30:01,081 --> 00:30:02,426
When you came through that door

338
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,200
it was chhh-chhh-chhh.

339
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:08,677
Three.

340
00:30:18,094 --> 00:30:20,832
And another thing,
you dont eat crap like this.

341
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:22,892
This is for losers and old men.

342
00:30:25,234 --> 00:30:26,586
And were gonna have to bunk up.

343
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:29,262
If were gonna do this right,
you gotta stay at the house.

344
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:32,605
I watch your diet,
we follow the old regimen.

345
00:30:34,456 --> 00:30:35,578
You copy?

346
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:41,931
Copy.

347
00:30:57,892 --> 00:31:02,592
My brother said in the middle of night,
he was at the strip  club and saw Mr. C ...

348
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,182
You weren't there, you don't know.

349
00:31:05,217 --> 00:31:06,455
Whats MMA?

350
00:31:06,456 --> 00:31:07,456
Mixed Martial Arts.

351
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:09,351
Like, different styles of fighting.

352
00:31:17,851 --> 00:31:18,937
Take your seats.

353
00:31:18,938 --> 00:31:21,096
Now, please.

354
00:31:32,555 --> 00:31:33,609
- Yo, Mr. C.
- uh Huh?

355
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:38,795
My brother was at the titty bar last night
and he said you was choking brothers out.

356
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:39,796
Whats up? Is it true?

357
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:44,576
Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, did you really
work on some fools or something?

358
00:31:44,577 --> 00:31:45,577
You have to tell us.

359
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:46,578
- Yeah.

360
00:31:57,795 --> 00:32:00,550
I want examples of 'forms of energy'.

361
00:32:21,445 --> 00:32:22,785
Cmon, its not as bad as it looks.

362
00:32:24,001 --> 00:32:25,725
- Are you being literal or figurative?

363
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:27,951
Because literally it looks bad.

364
00:32:27,952 --> 00:32:30,797
And figuratively it looks even worse.

365
00:32:32,127 --> 00:32:34,382
The superintendents coming by in a few minutes.

366
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:38,282
- Oh, Man!

367
00:32:38,283 --> 00:32:39,283
- So, c'mon Brandon.

368
00:32:39,284 --> 00:32:41,657
gimme a little help here.

369
00:32:41,658 --> 00:32:45,534
Could you explain to me
what the hell you were doing?

370
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,157
- I need the money, Joe.

371
00:32:52,158 --> 00:32:53,158
- Yeah, but this is...

372
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:56,656
We cant have this!

373
00:32:56,657 --> 00:32:59,568
This isnt moonlighting at Applebees
for Christs sake.

374
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:02,246
Shit, Brendan.

375
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,492
Leaving everything else aside,
which we cant,

376
00:33:06,406 --> 00:33:07,530
are you out of your mind?

377
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:09,517
Youre gonna get yourself killed.

378
00:33:10,528 --> 00:33:12,242
I mean, youre..
youre a goddamn teacher.

379
00:33:12,243 --> 00:33:14,436
Youve got no business
in the ring with those animals.

380
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,250
- Actually, I used to be one of those animals.

381
00:33:22,306 --> 00:33:23,352
I fought for a living.

382
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:27,944
Guess I forgot to put that
down on my application.

383
00:33:30,585 --> 00:33:31,616
- Yeah, I guess you did.

384
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:34,940
- Look, Im sorry, Joe. Its just--

385
00:33:34,941 --> 00:33:40,520
- Look, look...the school districts not going to
tolerate school teachers cockfighting in strip clubs.

386
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:43,373
- It was the parking lot of a strip club.

387
00:33:43,374 --> 00:33:46,186
- Wherever it was,
you cant be doing it, alright?

388
00:33:46,707 --> 00:33:47,788
I mean this is a serious--

389
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:48,789
shit, hes here.

390
00:33:50,535 --> 00:33:52,000
This is a serious problem.

391
00:33:57,428 --> 00:33:59,829
The guy hasnt been inside a school since 9-11.

392
00:34:03,035 --> 00:34:04,022
- What are we gonna do?

393
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:09,056
- You say yes, sir.
And you say no, sir.

394
00:34:09,057 --> 00:34:11,770
And you say itll never happen again, sir.

395
00:34:13,048 --> 00:34:16,262
And then we just
pray to God hes in a good mood.

396
00:34:22,885 --> 00:34:25,112
- UFC?

397
00:34:25,113 --> 00:34:26,113
- Yeah.

398
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:30,005
- Sonofabitch.

399
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,008
What are you doing?

400
00:34:59,112 --> 00:35:02,562
- The girls have an important
piano recital in the morning.

401
00:35:04,094 --> 00:35:05,737
Got an equipment malfunction.

402
00:35:10,738 --> 00:35:11,632
Howd it go?

403
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:15,597
- Theyre gonna review your case
at the end of the semester,

404
00:35:17,445 --> 00:35:20,095
but until then
youre suspended without pay.

405
00:35:28,511 --> 00:35:30,529
Joe gave me the number of his attorney.

406
00:35:32,893 --> 00:35:34,623
- How the hell are we gonna
pay for an attorney?

407
00:35:34,624 --> 00:35:37,063
- He talked to me for free.
As a favor to Joe.

408
00:35:37,064 --> 00:35:39,332
- That's nice.

409
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:42,202
- He said theres no precedent for this.

410
00:35:42,203 --> 00:35:44,699
Youll be back by next semester.

411
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,700
- Next semester?

412
00:35:57,977 --> 00:35:59,345
Look, Tess.

413
00:36:00,851 --> 00:36:02,717
They have these smoker fights all over.

414
00:36:05,057 --> 00:36:06,675
Theres one in Lancaster next week.

415
00:36:06,676 --> 00:36:08,929
Theres two in Dover the week after.

416
00:36:09,837 --> 00:36:10,615
Wilmington.

417
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,250
Camden. Baltimore.

418
00:36:16,793 --> 00:36:18,051
It could keep us afloat.

419
00:36:20,197 --> 00:36:22,714
- Youre gonna put yourself through this
over and over,

420
00:36:22,715 --> 00:36:24,700
for five hundred bucks a pop?

421
00:36:27,627 --> 00:36:29,141
- Some of them pay a little more than that.

422
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:36,798
I would have had to bounce for a month
to make what I made in two hours last night.

423
00:36:42,506 --> 00:36:44,127
And these guys,
theyre not real fighters.

424
00:36:46,316 --> 00:36:48,932
Theyre just guys
who have seen too much UFC on TV.

425
00:36:56,096 --> 00:36:57,473
If you have a better solution,

426
00:36:59,442 --> 00:37:00,749
Im all ears.

427
00:37:04,543 --> 00:37:06,276
- What are we gonna tell the girls?

428
00:37:08,065 --> 00:37:09,227
- Itll be fine.

429
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:11,849
Ill just leave the house as usual,

430
00:37:12,894 --> 00:37:15,055
except only this time,
Ill be going to the gym.

431
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:31,058
<i>Oh the duck goes quack - quack quack..</i>

432
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:36,040
<i>and the cow says moo, moo..mooooo!</i>

433
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:41,712
<i>But that rooster,
the old red rooster he knew everything...</i>

434
00:37:43,985 --> 00:37:46,528
<i>cock-a-doodle-doo. Cock-a- doodle-doo. </i>

435
00:37:47,384 --> 00:37:48,447
Let's go kiddo.

436
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,421
Let's get moving.

437
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,698
Look what I found..

438
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:59,409
in that disaster of a basement.

439
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:06,802
What do 'ya say we sit down
and update this?

440
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:13,160
And you can fill me in on;
how close you got to that record.

441
00:38:16,523 --> 00:38:20,587
Did you continue wrestling,
after you left with your mother?

442
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:27,622
Cmon, Tommy.
Tell me something.

443
00:38:30,273 --> 00:38:31,483
- Yeah, Ill tell ya something.

444
00:38:33,486 --> 00:38:35,505
You can take that back to where you found it.

445
00:38:36,668 --> 00:38:38,252
And you can leave
the coffee in the pot.

446
00:38:39,155 --> 00:38:40,751
I can pour that myself.

447
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:43,792
And  I can wake myself up, too.

448
00:38:55,153 --> 00:38:56,008
- OK.

449
00:38:56,009 --> 00:38:59,358
Hurt my knees coming up and down
those stairs anyhow.

450
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:04,417
I'll leave the coffee pots on til 0-500,
then I dump it.

451
00:39:04,418 --> 00:39:05,418
Damn dude, thats brutal.

452
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,993
I give command to dismiss.

453
00:39:12,994 --> 00:39:14,987
You'll wash your nasty bodies.

454
00:39:16,384 --> 00:39:17,582
and square your gear away.

455
00:39:36,154 --> 00:39:38,056
Damn dude, thats brutal.

456
00:39:39,956 --> 00:39:40,868
- Whats that?

457
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:44,553
Dude, Mad Dog Grimes gettin tuned up
by some dude in a gym in Pittsburgh.

458
00:39:44,554 --> 00:39:45,554
- Whos Mad Dog Grimes?

459
00:39:45,555 --> 00:39:48,722
- Shit, Bradford.
The stuff you dont know amazes me.

460
00:39:50,075 --> 00:39:51,043
Oh my god, did you see that?

461
00:39:51,044 --> 00:39:52,044
- Wait, rewind that.

462
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,234
Right there...
pause, pause..pause.

463
00:40:02,431 --> 00:40:03,513
What's up man?

464
00:40:06,757 --> 00:40:07,797
Dude, what's his deal?

465
00:40:15,776 --> 00:40:17,032
AV, I need to see the tape!

466
00:40:17,033 --> 00:40:18,033
- What tape?

467
00:40:19,194 --> 00:40:20,533
- The tape.

468
00:40:25,814 --> 00:40:26,916
Get the camera.

469
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,555
Thats him.

470
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,324
Thats him.

471
00:41:10,498 --> 00:41:11,799
Frank: Let the music sink in to you.

472
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,800
This is Beethoven.

473
00:41:12,801 --> 00:41:13,801
And I want you to breathe.

474
00:41:13,802 --> 00:41:14,802
I don't want you boxing like this.

475
00:41:14,803 --> 00:41:16,830
No more stiffs...right?

476
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:18,270
You listen to the music.

477
00:41:18,305 --> 00:41:19,432
You relax...you breathe.

478
00:41:47,244 --> 00:41:49,743
Do I know you?

479
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:53,244
Long time, brother.

480
00:41:55,745 --> 00:41:56,561
- I'm liking the place.

481
00:41:58,167 --> 00:41:59,136
- You see this beast?

482
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:02,563
Marco Santos?
Im training him for Sparta.

483
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:03,564
- Oh Yeah, right.

484
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:04,565
- Not bad, right?

485
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:05,566
- It's amazing man.

486
00:42:12,214 --> 00:42:13,123
You look good, brother.

487
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:14,182
- Thanks.

488
00:42:18,796 --> 00:42:20,038
-  Howre the girls?

489
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:23,723
- Good.
I had another little one. Rosie.

490
00:42:23,724 --> 00:42:27,783
- I know. Because, Johnny C. told me
she was in the hospital for a bit.

491
00:42:30,622 --> 00:42:31,803
You know I uh..

492
00:42:34,924 --> 00:42:36,593
I was gonna call you and then time went by.

493
00:42:36,594 --> 00:42:39,229
Im a piece of shit.
I should have called you, I'm sorry.

494
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:43,363
No, Brendan. Im sorry.

495
00:42:44,811 --> 00:42:46,649
- Its all good.
Shes good now.

496
00:42:52,854 --> 00:42:54,064
- Its good to see you, man.

497
00:42:54,065 --> 00:42:57,863
So everythings going...
It's great huh?

498
00:43:00,434 --> 00:43:03,635
- Yeah. Well, Ive got a little problem.

499
00:43:06,406 --> 00:43:08,806
The guys at the bank
want to take my house away.

500
00:43:08,807 --> 00:43:09,807
- Wow.
- Yeah.

501
00:43:11,407 --> 00:43:13,126
Thats kind of why I came to see you, actually.

502
00:43:18,798 --> 00:43:21,848
- Ive got most of my dough tied up
in this joint, but..

503
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:22,849
how much do you need?

504
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,444
- I didnt come here for a loan, Frank.

505
00:43:25,445 --> 00:43:26,445
I mean...

506
00:43:26,446 --> 00:43:31,359
I was hoping youd train me.

507
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,257
- Train you for what?

508
00:43:35,153 --> 00:43:36,607
- I want to get back in the cage.

509
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:39,618
- Are you serious?

510
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,678
Come on, Brandon.

511
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:45,604
- I just won an event the other night.

512
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:48,556
- Ah, you won an event.
Thats what this is.

513
00:43:50,245 --> 00:43:51,632
Let me guess,
it was in a parking lot.

514
00:43:51,633 --> 00:43:54,842
DJ from the local radio station.
Couple of ring card girls...

515
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:55,843
you wouldnt bang on a dare.

516
00:43:55,844 --> 00:43:56,844
Am I right?

517
00:43:59,107 --> 00:44:00,506
- Ish.
-  Ish...

518
00:44:01,741 --> 00:44:03,530
Brendan. I love you.

519
00:44:05,162 --> 00:44:06,409
Why would I train you?

520
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:11,819
When you were in shape and on the right side
of 30 you were barely a .500 fighter. You never listened to me.

521
00:44:13,628 --> 00:44:15,123
You never listened to anyone.

522
00:44:15,124 --> 00:44:16,124
These guys are animals.

523
00:44:19,143 --> 00:44:20,585
Youre a teacher, right?

524
00:44:21,852 --> 00:44:24,660
Whatre you gonna do? Youre gonna come down
here for a couple days a week after detention?

525
00:44:25,923 --> 00:44:28,185
Youre gonna skip out of the girls
volleyball game early?

526
00:44:30,038 --> 00:44:31,312
- Ive got loads of time.

527
00:44:31,313 --> 00:44:32,313
Times not an issue.

528
00:44:33,509 --> 00:44:35,357
The parking lot thing
kinda got me suspended.

529
00:44:43,983 --> 00:44:45,518
I need to keep working the smokers.

530
00:44:50,193 --> 00:44:51,252
- Tess know about this?
- Mmm..hmm.

531
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:57,574
- Cause the last time you  fought, I got read the riot act
sitting in a hospital waiting room. You remember that?

532
00:44:58,752 --> 00:44:59,867
- I was unconscious.

533
00:44:59,868 --> 00:45:02,342
- You were more than unconcious.

534
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:08,184
Shes not gonna come down here with
the two puppies, screaming at Frank?

535
00:45:09,302 --> 00:45:10,475
- Its not gonna happen.

536
00:45:13,023 --> 00:45:14,055
What do you say, Frank?

537
00:45:16,173 --> 00:45:17,956
- What do I say?
What am I gonna say to you? No?

538
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,063
I mean,
all my time is wrapped up with Marco.

539
00:45:21,064 --> 00:45:22,064
You come down,
Ill throw you in the rotation,

540
00:45:22,065 --> 00:45:24,068
you spar with these guys,

541
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:27,535
But I cant promise you
much more than that, Brendan.

542
00:45:29,036 --> 00:45:30,212
- Thats all I need.

543
00:45:34,449 --> 00:45:35,344
I appreciate it.

544
00:45:39,052 --> 00:45:40,134
- Let me know when youre coming down.

545
00:45:40,135 --> 00:45:42,223
Well, Im just gonna go
get my stuff from the car.

546
00:45:44,197 --> 00:45:45,501
- Now?

547
00:46:11,981 --> 00:46:14,395
Hey, Brendan.

548
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,396
Its me, Pop.

549
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:22,882
Whatre you doing here?

550
00:46:23,975 --> 00:46:25,435
- I have some news for you.

551
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:30,527
- Something wrong with your hands?

552
00:46:32,344 --> 00:46:34,566
If theres nothing wrong with your hands
then theres no reason for you not to phone.

553
00:46:35,395 --> 00:46:36,282
- Thats the deal.
- I forgot.

554
00:46:37,479 --> 00:46:39,307
- Phone or mail, Pop.
Non negotiable.

555
00:46:39,308 --> 00:46:40,308
- Hey Brendan,

556
00:46:40,309 --> 00:46:43,039
Have you ever seen my hands so steady?

557
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,040
Ever seen them?

558
00:46:47,348 --> 00:46:48,188
- Im going inside.

559
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:50,190
- Ive got a thousand days, Brendan.

560
00:46:52,373 --> 00:46:54,042
A thousand days sober today.

561
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:57,173
- Well, thats great, Pop.
But it doesnt change anything.

562
00:46:57,208 --> 00:47:00,323
- What do you mean it doesnt change anything?
Have a heart, Brendan.

563
00:47:00,324 --> 00:47:01,324
- You listen to me.

564
00:47:03,545 --> 00:47:06,065
You take your have-a-heart bullshit
and you run it down the road.

565
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,696
Run it out on someone
who doesnt know you like I do.

566
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:14,072
- I thought maybe we could break bread.

567
00:47:15,927 --> 00:47:17,777
Open some lines of communication.

568
00:47:17,778 --> 00:47:18,778
- You got two lines of communication,

569
00:47:18,779 --> 00:47:21,816
You got the telephone and the post office.

570
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:25,382
Just because you decide its a special day,
it doesnt make it one for me.

571
00:47:25,383 --> 00:47:26,383
I got a wife and kids inside

572
00:47:26,384 --> 00:47:29,312
and theyre waiting for me,
so I dont have time for whatever this is.

573
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:30,313
-  I know you got a wife and kids in there.

574
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:33,558
I got a grand-daughter in there..

575
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:37,024
and I havent seen in three years
and another I havent even ever met.

576
00:47:37,025 --> 00:47:38,025
- Yeah, Why is that, Pop?

577
00:47:40,135 --> 00:47:41,322
Why is that?

578
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:45,282
Do you remember having anything to do with that?

579
00:47:45,283 --> 00:47:46,283
- Yeah.

580
00:47:49,368 --> 00:47:50,550
- That shit you pulled.

581
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,074
Never again.

582
00:47:55,944 --> 00:47:57,440
And all the shit I saw growing up?

583
00:47:59,203 --> 00:48:00,791
That doesnt happen here.

584
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,740
Take care of yourself.

585
00:48:07,367 --> 00:48:08,710
- Tommys back.

586
00:48:15,297 --> 00:48:16,739
Hes in the Burgh.

587
00:48:21,704 --> 00:48:23,059
- You say, Tommys in Pittsburgh?

588
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,060
- He came to see me.

589
00:48:27,454 --> 00:48:28,637
- He came to see you?

590
00:48:31,093 --> 00:48:32,334
- Hes over at the house.

591
00:48:33,454 --> 00:48:37,550
Were doing a little training at Fitzys.

592
00:48:37,551 --> 00:48:38,551
Remember Fitzys?

593
00:48:38,552 --> 00:48:41,518
It aint Fitzys anymore.

594
00:48:43,959 --> 00:48:45,730
- You and Tommy are training together?

595
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:48,908
Tommy Conlon?

596
00:48:48,909 --> 00:48:49,909
- Riordan.

597
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:52,086
Hes using your mothers maiden name now.

598
00:48:52,087 --> 00:48:53,087
I know what her name is.

599
00:48:53,088 --> 00:48:57,594
- I thought youd want to know hes back.
Thats why I drove all the way over here.

600
00:48:57,595 --> 00:49:00,518
- I thought you came
to break bread over a thousand days?

601
00:49:01,725 --> 00:49:03,980
That too.

602
00:49:08,269 --> 00:49:09,908
- Did he say if he wants to see me?

603
00:49:11,872 --> 00:49:13,229
- He doesnt say much.

604
00:49:19,321 --> 00:49:21,262
Hes just not that happy kid he was.

605
00:49:24,187 --> 00:49:25,298
- Wow, look at you.

606
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:26,299
Mister inside man.

607
00:49:29,335 --> 00:49:31,527
You and Tommy training together
like nothing ever happened.

608
00:49:31,562 --> 00:49:32,856
This is unbelievable.

609
00:49:33,616 --> 00:49:34,930
- Now I know what youre really doing here.
- Whats that?

610
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:35,931
- You came to gloat.

611
00:49:35,932 --> 00:49:38,902
- I did not come to gloat.
I came to get my son back.

612
00:49:38,903 --> 00:49:39,903
- Well, there you go.

613
00:49:39,904 --> 00:49:40,904
Hey, You got your son back.

614
00:49:40,905 --> 00:49:41,905
- Im talking about you, Bren--

615
00:49:41,906 --> 00:49:42,906
- You got your son back.

616
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,414
You know,

617
00:49:53,139 --> 00:49:54,177
Forget it!

618
00:49:55,820 --> 00:50:00,067
I'll tell you, part of the reason
I stuck around was...

619
00:50:00,068 --> 00:50:03,152
cause I thought Id finally get you all to myself.

620
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,233
But you didnt have any interest in training me.

621
00:50:09,234 --> 00:50:10,234
Tommy was the one.

622
00:50:10,235 --> 00:50:12,566
- Ah, Brendan.
I was a drunk.

623
00:50:12,567 --> 00:50:13,567
I mean, you know.

624
00:50:15,367 --> 00:50:16,673
Im sorry.

625
00:50:18,446 --> 00:50:19,718
You were always a front runner.

626
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,648
You never had any interest in underdogs.

627
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,418
But I was your son.

628
00:50:26,419 --> 00:50:27,419
- You are my son, Brendan.

629
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,420
- Am I?

630
00:50:28,421 --> 00:50:29,421
- Yeah, you are.

631
00:50:31,982 --> 00:50:35,374
Im just asking you to find...

632
00:50:37,506 --> 00:50:40,726
a whoo bit of space in your heart to forgive me.

633
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:48,439
- Yeah. Alright.
I forgive you.

634
00:50:51,155 --> 00:50:52,665
But I do not trust you.

635
00:50:55,275 --> 00:50:58,391
So, tell Tommy...if he wants to see me,
this is where I am.

636
00:51:00,532 --> 00:51:02,130
- But theyre not different things.

637
00:51:02,131 --> 00:51:03,131
Youve gotta trust to forgive--

638
00:51:04,286 --> 00:51:05,473
- Goodnight, Pop.

639
00:51:05,474 --> 00:51:09,083
My God, is that Emily?

640
00:51:09,084 --> 00:51:12,902
Shes grown, Brendan.
Is that Rosie?

641
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:13,903
- Daddy, who is that?

642
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,719
- Just some nice old man.

I told you that.

Were gonna end up cashing in your life insurance
policy before we pick up that prize money.

763
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:19,914
- You dont think I can do it. Right?

764
01:02:20,789 --> 01:02:22,353
- I think you can get killed.

765

Youre not gonna end up paralyzed?

The Amtrack was upside down. </i>

<i>Water was coming in from everywhere. </i>

803
01:07:06,277 --> 01:07:08,696
<i>The water pressure was too much.
We couldnt get the back hatch open. </i>

804
01:07:10,034 --> 01:07:11,288
<i>We were all drowning, man.</i>

805
01:07:12,271 --> 01:07:13,496
<i>It was a death trap. </i>

806
01:07:13,497 --> 01:07:16,076
<i>I couldnt have had more than another minute. </i>

807
01:07:16,077 --> 01:07:19,375
<i>Suddenly the back ramp gets ripped off,</i>

808
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:22,006
<i>and there he was. </i>

809
01:07:25,497 --> 01:07:27,309
<i>Before I could get out and thank him,
he was gone.</i>

810
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:30,498
<i> He just vanished like a ghost. </i>

811
01:07:31,825 --> 01:07:33,403
- Where are you going?
- Im takin a walk.

812
01:07:36,853 --> 01:07:38,098
<i>I just wanna say...</i>

813
01:07:39,074 --> 01:07:40,310
<i>Thank You.</i>

814
01:07:40,345 --> 01:07:42,204

819
01:08:42,306 --> 01:08:43,744
Been looking all over for you.

820
01:08:46,577 --> 01:08:47,765
Hows it going?

821
01:08:49,136 --> 01:08:50,255
- Its going.

822
01:08:53,197 --> 01:08:54,843
- I was thinking maybe we could grab a coffee.

823
01:08:57,490 --> 01:08:59,314
- I dont drink coffee, man.
What 'ya want?

824
01:09:02,751 --> 01:09:04,170
- You dont want to go sit down somewhere?

825
01:09:07,336 --> 01:09:08,800
- Nah, Im good right here.

826
01:09:17,464 --> 01:09:18,402
- Shit, Tommy.

827
01:09:18,403 --> 01:09:21,111
How was I supposed to know
I was never gonna see you guys again?

828
01:09:21,112 --> 01:09:22,112
- Yeah, well..you were briefed.

829
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:25,939
You had the information.

830
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:30,916
You chose the old man and the girl.

831
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:33,325
- She wasnt some girl.

832
01:09:36,203 --> 01:09:37,360
I married her.

833
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:41,492
Shes my wife.

834
01:09:42,963 --> 01:09:43,984
See.

835
01:09:45,263 --> 01:09:46,250
Thats Tess.

836
01:09:47,692 --> 01:09:48,981
And thats Emily and Rosie.

837
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,554
Theyre your nieces, Tommy.

838
01:09:51,555 --> 01:09:52,555
- I dont know em.

839
01:09:54,534 --> 01:09:55,639
- I know you dont know them.

840
01:09:55,674 --> 01:09:56,794
Of course you dont know them.

841
01:09:57,923 --> 01:09:59,892
- Why am I looking at pictures
of people I dont know?

842
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:03,987
- Because thats my family.

843
01:10:06,794 --> 01:10:08,359
- And who are you exactly?

844
01:10:13,795 --> 01:10:15,057
- Im your brother, man.

845
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:19,522
- You were in the Corps?

846
01:10:19,523 --> 01:10:20,523
What?

847
01:10:21,814 --> 01:10:23,599
- I said I didnt know you were in the Corps.

848
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,600
- I wasnt in the Corps.

849
01:10:26,272 --> 01:10:27,551
- Then you aint no brother to me.

850
01:10:29,645 --> 01:10:30,960
My brother was in the Corps.

851
01:10:30,961 --> 01:10:31,961
- Jesus, Tommy.

852
01:10:33,264 --> 01:10:36,485
I was a 16 year old kid.
What the hell did I know?

853
01:10:36,486 --> 01:10:40,084
- I dont know what you know.
Why dont you go ask your girlfriend about it?

854
01:10:40,085 --> 01:10:41,085
Shes my wife, Tommy.

855
01:10:41,086 --> 01:10:42,086
So thats it?

856
01:10:42,087 --> 01:10:45,067
I stay with Tess
and I never get to see you guys again?

857
01:10:45,068 --> 01:10:47,416
Not a single phone call?
Nothing?

858
01:10:49,072 --> 01:10:51,172
God, man,
I dont understand this.

859
01:10:53,588 --> 01:10:57,301
So, you wont forgive me,
but you forgave Pop?

860
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,006
- Hes just some old vet I train with.

861
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:03,007
He means nothing to me.

862
01:11:05,585 --> 01:11:07,531
From what I hear
he means nothing to you, either,

863
01:11:09,781 --> 01:11:12,170
so you got balls
talking about forgiveness.

864
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:15,621
- Thats got nothing to do with forgiveness.
I've got children, man.

865
01:11:15,622 --> 01:11:19,157
Ive got a family to protect.
Everything I do is for them.

866
01:11:19,158 --> 01:11:21,274
But I forgave Pop.

867
01:11:22,459 --> 01:11:24,062
Just like I forgave you and Mom.

868
01:11:31,753 --> 01:11:33,005
- You forgave us?

869
01:11:35,055 --> 01:11:36,126
- Yeah.

870
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:39,361
Im not surprised
you made the tournament, Brendan.

871
01:11:39,362 --> 01:11:40,362
You got some stones, man.

872
01:11:41,736 --> 01:11:43,213
- I fell in love,

873
01:11:43,248 --> 01:11:44,447
What the hell was I supposed to do?

874
01:11:44,448 --> 01:11:46,428
- You were supposed to stick to the plan.
You were supposed to come with us.

875
01:11:46,429 --> 01:11:49,608
Mom needed you.
I needed you. You were my big brother

876
01:11:49,643 --> 01:11:50,698
and you bailed on me.

877
01:11:52,337 --> 01:11:54,624
Hey, Im glad you stayed and
everything worked out for you,

878
01:11:55,918 --> 01:11:57,210
you leave, you get the opposite.

879
01:11:59,385 --> 01:12:01,868
You leave,
you get to  bury people.

880
01:12:01,869 --> 01:12:04,611
- Youre not the only one who suffered, Tommy.

881
01:12:06,857 --> 01:12:08,579
I didnt even know she was sick.

882
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:13,797
I never even got the chance
to say goodbye to my own mother.

883
01:12:17,363 --> 01:12:18,861
You had no right to keep that from me!

884
01:12:18,896 --> 01:12:20,737
That was not your decision to make!

885
01:12:23,284 --> 01:12:24,349
- You know what?

886
01:12:25,739 --> 01:12:28,095
You walk around with your pictures in your wallet;

887
01:12:28,096 --> 01:12:33,801
and youre all,
I forgive you, I forgive Pop.

888
01:12:35,104 --> 01:12:37,269
I forgive everyone.
But you know what?

889
01:12:39,449 --> 01:12:40,805
Youre full of shit.

890
01:12:47,401 --> 01:12:48,600
Are we done, Brendan?

891
01:12:48,635 --> 01:12:49,864
Are we finished?

892
01:13:10,186 --> 01:13:14,704
You realize youre supposed to seek
my wise counsel when schools actually in session, right?

893
01:13:14,705 --> 01:13:15,705
- Yes, Mr.Zito.

894
01:13:17,266 --> 01:13:20,342
We want to use the auditorium
this weekend to watch Mr. C in Sparta.

895
01:13:21,282 --> 01:13:22,349
What do you say?

896
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:26,114
So, you want to use the auditorium
to watch a  suspended teacher...

897
01:13:26,115 --> 01:13:28,492
engage in the activity he was suspended for?

898
01:13:28,493 --> 01:13:29,493
Am I hearing this correctly?

899
01:13:32,175 --> 01:13:33,605
It can turn into fund raiser, you know?

900
01:13:33,606 --> 01:13:35,980
I gotta talk to your parents.

901
01:13:35,981 --> 01:13:38,559
Because, you guys might need
to be in summer school after all.

902
01:13:41,356 --> 01:13:43,716
The gyms the only place thats big enough.
To fit everyone.

903
01:13:43,717 --> 01:13:44,717
- Its never gonna happen.

904
01:13:44,718 --> 01:13:45,718
- What if we get a petition signed?

905
01:13:50,104 --> 01:13:53,192
I appreciate that you guys love your teacher.
I really do.

906
01:13:53,193 --> 01:13:56,190
But there is nothing I can do for you.

907

<i>The roof is about to blow clean off

Is. Here! </i>

920
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:11,577
Welcome,
Im Bryan Callen;

921
01:15:11,578 --> 01:15:14,135
along with best-selling fight author Sam Sheridan.

922
01:15:14,136 --> 01:15:19,462
Sam, when J.J. Riley conceived Sparta,
he wanted to create, quite simply,

923
01:15:19,463 --> 01:15:23,208
the biggest Mixed Martial Arts
spectacle in history.

924
01:15:23,209 --> 01:15:25,366
- Five million dollars, Bryan.

925
01:15:25,367 --> 01:15:26,367
Five million dollars.

926
01:15:26,368 --> 01:15:29,265
J.J. Riley put his money
where his mouth is...

927
01:15:29,266 --> 01:15:32,437
and put up the biggest purse
this sport has ever seen.

928
01:15:32,438 --> 01:15:34,699
- Its unprecedented, Sam.

929
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:37,969
As is the hoopla surrounding Tommy Riordan,

930
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:38,970
the war hero---

931
01:15:38,971 --> 01:15:41,677
who has become an overnight sensation...

932
01:15:41,678 --> 01:15:44,182
and captured the imagination
and attention of....

933
01:15:58,679 --> 01:15:59,717
Five minutes, Paddy.

934
01:15:59,718 --> 01:16:00,718
okay.

935
01:16:03,631 --> 01:16:09,724
<i>It looks as though the moment of truth has arrived,
because here comes Tommy Riordan. </i>

936
01:16:09,725 --> 01:16:12,266
<i>Tommy Riordans captured the medias attention, </i>

937
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:13,267
<i>but the question still remains: </i>

938
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:16,948
<i>who is this guy?
And more importantly,</i>

939
01:16:16,949 --> 01:16:20,222
<i> can he compete in this talent pool?
Can he win? </i>

940
01:16:22,904 --> 01:16:25,388
<i>- Ive gotta say the fact that I dont know is strange. </i>

941
01:16:25,389 --> 01:16:28,142
<i>In an internet age
where there are no secrets, </i>

942
01:16:28,143 --> 01:16:29,143
<i>this guy is a complete mystery.</i>

943
01:16:29,144 --> 01:16:34,921
<i> I cant find out anything about him.
Tommy Riordan is officially Google proof. </i>

944
01:16:42,374 --> 01:16:43,534
<i>- You gotta love this guy, Sam.</i>

945
01:16:43,535 --> 01:16:46,664
<i>No walk out music,
no sponsors, no interviews.</i>

946
01:16:46,665 --> 01:16:47,665
<i>He skipped out on the press conference. </i>

947
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:50,816
<i>Wouldnt have his picture take for the program. </i>

948
01:16:50,817 --> 01:16:52,930
<i>Hes breaking every rule! </i>

949
01:16:52,931 --> 01:16:56,379
<i>- The only reason that
Tommy is even in this tournament is...</i>

950
01:16:56,380 --> 01:17:00,659
<i> because of a  video showing him beating up
Mad Dog Grimes in the gym.</i>

951
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:05,052
<i>- But the reason a lot of his fans
are in the stands is because of another video,</i>

952
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:07,797
<i>which is even more stunning than
the Mad Dog Grimes video.</i>

953
01:17:07,798 --> 01:17:11,145
<i>Let me describe it for you folks
for the few who havent seen it, </i>

954
01:17:12,277 --> 01:17:15,004
<i>but Tommy Riordan ripped the door off a tank</i>

955
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:18,764
<i>in the heat of battle,
saving lives in the process,</i>

956
01:17:18,765 --> 01:17:21,085
<i>and then walked away without claiming a medal. </i>

957
01:17:21,086 --> 01:17:22,086
<i>He ripped the door off a tank! </i>

958
01:17:22,087 --> 01:17:24,483
<i>- Tommy Riordan is a genuine war hero, </i>

959
01:17:24,484 --> 01:17:27,172
<i>Im not taking anything away from the guy.
Hes a very, very tough guy,</i>

960
01:17:27,173 --> 01:17:29,301
<i>but the tank dont hit back. </i>

961
01:17:29,302 --> 01:17:33,364
<i>Weve seen YouTube sensations
fail on the big stage before. </i>

962
01:17:33,365 --> 01:17:35,870
<i>- Sam. He ripped the door off a tank! </i>

963
01:17:39,001 --> 01:17:42,308
<i> Tommy Riordan definitely has his
hands full in his first opponent, </i>

964
01:17:42,309 --> 01:17:45,416
<i>Francisco Barbosa.
Barbosa is nothing to scoff at.</i>

965
01:17:45,417 --> 01:17:49,408
<i>Yeah, hes the real deal.
Very tough guy.</i>

966
01:17:49,409 --> 01:17:53,165
<i>Very high caliber fighter.
Tommy Riordan came out of nowhere, </i>

967
01:17:53,166 --> 01:17:55,433
<i>and I imagine hes going
to disappear just as quickly. </i>

968
01:18:05,334 --> 01:18:08,007
Gentlemen, youve been given your instructions.
I expect a clean fight.

969
01:18:08,008 --> 01:18:11,169
Obey my commands at all times.
Defend yourselves at all times.

970
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:13,371
Touch gloves,
go back, lets do this.

971
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:27,834
<i>Were about to get the big answer
to the big question: is Tommy Riordan for real? And here we go! </i>

972
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:35,053
<i> Barbosas gonna be looking for a take down. </i>

973
01:18:35,054 --> 01:18:36,054
<i>Definitely gonna be looking for a take down.</i>

974
01:18:41,308 --> 01:18:44,493
<i>Barbosa is down!
Barbosa has been knocked out! </i>

975
01:18:44,494 --> 01:18:47,633
<i>Tommy Riordan is most definitely for real! </i>

976
01:18:47,634 --> 01:18:49,866
<i>And now hes walking out of the cage! </i>

977
01:18:49,867 --> 01:18:50,867
<i>Hes leaving the cage!</i>

978
01:18:53,419 --> 01:18:55,350
<i> There goes another rule out the window!</i>

979
01:18:58,637 --> 01:19:02,136
<i>Francisco Barbosa is out cold,
and he is out of this tournament, Bryan. </i>

980
01:20:27,805 --> 01:20:28,826
You can do this. 

981
01:20:35,643 --> 01:20:36,654
I want to hear you say it.

982
01:20:42,848 --> 01:20:43,856
I can do this. 

983
01:20:45,065 --> 01:20:46,446
Then lets go do this. 

984
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,353
Yeah.

985
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:07,349
<i>J.J. Riley had less than 48 hours 
to fill the spot, </i>

986
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:10,456
<i>and he basically had to rely 
on the word of Frank Campana. </i>

987
01:21:10,457 --> 01:21:14,716
<i>And he chose Brendan Conlon, 
which quite frankly is something I just dont understand. </i>

988
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:23,583
Brendan, Go get em. 

989
01:21:33,512 --> 01:21:35,462
<i>I can understand coming out to no music,  </i>

990
01:21:35,463 --> 01:21:39,640
<i>by why in the world would you choose 
classical music as your entrance?</i>

991
01:21:39,641 --> 01:21:40,641
<i>This is Beethoven,
 This is Ode to Joy, Bryan.</i>

992
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:44,124
<i>My apologies, Mr. Renaissance man.</i>

993
01:21:47,505 --> 01:21:50,759
<i>You want to talk about renaissance 
 men, you gotta talk about Frank Campana. </i>

994
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:51,760
<i>Very unorthodox trainer,</i>

995
01:21:51,761 --> 01:21:54,154
<i>and one of the best trainer in the game. </i>

996
01:21:54,155 --> 01:21:58,291
<i>Hes well known for using classical music
 to train his fighters to remain calm, </i>

997
01:21:58,292 --> 01:22:01,900
<i>to remain patient, 
and to remain composed under pressure. </i>

998
01:22:01,901 --> 01:22:08,397
<i>Classical music is about as fitting 
to this setting as Brendan Conlon is to this tournament. </i>

999
01:22:08,398 --> 01:22:09,398
<i>In fact, let me show you something. </i>

1000
01:22:14,019 --> 01:22:16,267
<i>That my friend, is Brendan Conlon.</i>

1001
01:22:17,445 --> 01:22:19,902
<i>Brendan Conlon is about to get dropped into a shark tank. </i>

1002
01:22:19,903 --> 01:22:20,903
<i> Hes a feeder fish.</i>

1003
01:22:21,772 --> 01:22:23,160
<i>Cmon, give the guy a break.</i>

1004
01:22:24,328 --> 01:22:29,063
<i>At least weve seen him fight before. 
He has been in the UFC. We remember him.</i>

1005
01:22:29,064 --> 01:22:32,236
<i>I remember him, too. 
I remember him being very unmemorable. </i>

1006
01:22:52,687 --> 01:22:55,627
<i>Midnight Le getting ready to climb
 into the cage and go to work. </i>

1007
01:22:55,628 --> 01:22:56,628
<i>When the brackets were announced, </i>

1008
01:22:56,629 --> 01:22:59,047
<i>He thought hed be going up against Marco Santos.</i>

1009
01:22:59,048 --> 01:23:01,950
<i>Hes gotta be thrilled to be seeing 
Brendan Conlon standing across from him.</i>

1010
01:23:03,146 --> 01:23:04,267
You asked for it. 

1011
01:23:04,268 --> 01:23:06,981
<i>Brendan retired from fighting some years ago, </i>

1012
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,383
<i>hes actually a high school Physics teacher now, </i>

1013
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:12,836
<i>and Midnight had some fun with that 
at the press conference, yesterday.</i>

1014
01:23:12,837 --> 01:23:15,776
<i>He said he was gonna give 
the teacher a serious lesson, </i>

1015
01:23:15,777 --> 01:23:18,771
<i>and that getting killed 
was no way to spend a summer vacation. </i>

1016
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:38,840
Alright, guys, youve been given your instructions,
 I expect a clean fight. 

1017
01:23:38,841 --> 01:23:42,278
Obey my commands at all times. 
Defend yourselves at all times. 

1018

Touch gloves, 
go back, lets do this. 

1019
01:23:46,464 --> 01:23:47,652
Have some fun, baby.

1020
01:24:09,707 --> 01:24:10,624
Move! You gotta move! 

1021
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:50,135
<i>Midnight is all over Brendan. </i>

1022
01:24:50,136 --> 01:24:52,888
<i>This cant last much longer. 
This wont last much longer.</i>

1023
01:24:52,923 --> 01:24:54,446
<i> The teacher just has no answers. </i>

1024
01:24:58,924 --> 01:25:01,308
<i>And now hes got the hooks in. </i>

1025
01:26:00,718 --> 01:26:03,178
Beautiful! Beautiful! 
He doesnt know what hit him! 

1026
01:28:26,715 --> 01:28:27,697
<i>Midnight is in big trouble!</i>

1027
01:28:45,108 --> 01:28:47,836
<i>This isnt happening!
 This cant  happen! </i>

1028
01:28:50,925 --> 01:28:53,260
<i>Brendan Conlon tapped Midnight!
 I cant believe it!</i>

1029
01:29:04,359 --> 01:29:07,724
He tapped him out! He tapped him out!
 He did it! He did it! He did  it! 

1030
01:29:12,582 --> 01:29:15,027
<i> This is what so great about Mixed Martial Arts.</i>

1031
01:29:15,028 --> 01:29:16,028
<i>Theres so many ways to lose.</i>

1032
01:29:16,029 --> 01:29:20,712
<i> One tiny miscalculation 
anyone can win at any time. </i>

1033
01:29:20,713 --> 01:29:26,306
<i>Frank Campana embracing his man, I dont think 
either one of them can believe what just happened. </i>

1034
01:29:28,387 --> 01:29:30,442
<i>Great show of sportsmanship from the teacher. </i>

1035
01:29:31,542 --> 01:29:34,458
<i>Thats a hallmark of Frank Campanas 
philosophy right there.</i>

1036
01:29:37,755 --> 01:29:39,230
<i>Midnight Le is shocked. </i>

1037
01:29:39,231 --> 01:29:42,430
<i>He thought he had a free pass into the second round,
 but instead hes going home.</i>

1038
01:29:42,431 --> 01:29:46,544
<i> He dominated the fight the entire way,
 but fell prey to a very technical finish. </i>

1039
01:29:46,545 --> 01:29:49,006
<i>Very technical finish, 
but come on, thats a fluke. </i>

1040
01:29:51,105 --> 01:29:52,034
<i>You call it a fluke. </i>

1041
01:29:52,035 --> 01:29:55,377
<i>I call it a guy maintaining composure 
and waiting for his opportunity.</i>

1042
01:29:57,055 --> 01:29:58,921
<i>Conlon beats Midnight! </i>

1043
01:29:58,922 --> 01:29:59,922
<i>Unbelievable!!!</i>

1044
01:30:02,025 --> 01:30:03,861
<i>I hope you got a receipt for your goldfish.</i>

1045
01:30:26,072 --> 01:30:27,076
I WON!!!!!!!!

1046
01:30:27,111 --> 01:30:28,125
 Yes! 

1047
01:30:42,904 --> 01:30:44,949
<i>Were down to eight fighters, 
soon to be seven </i>

for the second time tonight. </i>

1049

<i>Here comes the underdog, Brendan Conlon.</i>

1050
01:31:25,995 --> 01:31:28,269
<i>The teacher miraculously 
passed his first test, </i>

1051

<i>but now hes gotta face The Dane. </i>

1052

Brendan, You can do it. 

1053

<i>Halfway through round three now 
and the beating continues.</i>

1054

<i>I honestly dont know 
how Brendan Conlon is still standing, Sam.</i>

1055
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:45,910
<i>He has been absolutely battered 
in both his fights tonight. </i>

1056
01:31:54,763 --> 01:31:55,746
Take him down! 

1057
01:32:28,372 --> 01:32:29,349
 Way to go, Brendan! 

1058
01:32:30,131 --> 01:32:31,239
Im doing it ! 


1059
01:32:31,274 --> 01:32:32,282

to do with all this adulation,</i>

1062
01:32:43,741 --> 01:32:44,879
<i>Hes just here to fight. </i>

1063

Gentlemen, you ready? 

1064
01:32:50,771 --> 01:32:51,813
You ready? 

1065
01:32:51,814 --> 01:32:52,814
Lets go to war! 

1066
01:32:55,141 --> 01:32:56,858
Here he comes again like a buzzsaw. 

1067
01:33:00,511 --> 01:33:02,501
He's is all over Diego Santana!

01:34:21,276 --> 01:34:24,708
I know that other things...

1072

bothering the hell out of you, 

1073
01:34:30,977 --> 01:34:32,549
Im proud of you. Tommy.

1074
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:35,932
What you did for that kid  in the tank? 

1075
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:38,832
That was really something. 

1076
01:34:42,774 --> 01:34:44,561
How about deserting my unit? 

1077
01:34:46,386 --> 01:34:47,895
Is that really something, too?

1078
01:34:51,757 --> 01:34:52,768
 Yeah.

1079
01:34:52,769 --> 01:34:56,820
I was on my way outta country 
when I  came across those guys. 

1080
01:34:58,543 --> 01:35:00,344
What was I supposed to do, let em drown? 

1081
01:35:00,345 --> 01:35:01,345
No. 

1082
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:05,848
Whatd you do? 

1083
01:35:05,849 --> 01:35:06,849
Whatd I do? 

1084
01:35:09,877 --> 01:35:11,086
I took off. 

1085
01:35:14,968 --> 01:35:16,499
Thats why you go by Riordan. 

1086
01:35:18,436 --> 01:35:20,508
Thats why they
cant find your service records. 

1087
01:35:24,854 --> 01:35:26,740
What the hell happened over there, Tommy? 

1088
01:35:28,884 --> 01:35:30,437
That is none of your business.

1089
01:35:30,438 --> 01:35:33,066
Come on, kiddo. Ive been there.

1090
01:35:33,067 --> 01:35:35,463
Ive done it. Ive seen it.

1091
01:35:35,464 --> 01:35:37,936
You can trust me.
 Ill understand. 

1092
01:35:37,937 --> 01:35:40,458
Spare me the compassionate father routine, Pop. 

1093
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:43,573
The suit dont fit.

1094
01:35:44,984 --> 01:35:48,225
Tommy, Im really trying here.

1095
01:35:50,059 --> 01:35:51,118
 Youre trying? 

1096
01:35:52,752 --> 01:35:53,815
Now?

1097
01:35:56,598 --> 01:35:57,836
Where were you when it mattered? 

1098
01:35:59,957 --> 01:36:02,614
I needed this guy back when I was a kid.

1099
01:36:02,615 --> 01:36:03,615
 I dont need you now. 

1100
01:36:05,237 --> 01:36:07,462
Its too late now. 
Everythings already happened.

1101
01:36:09,313 --> 01:36:11,220
 You and Brendan dont seem to understand that.

1102
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:14,797
 Let me explain something to you, okay?

1103
01:36:16,042 --> 01:36:19,773
the only thing I have in common 
with Brendan Conlon is that;

1104
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:24,789
the pair of us, 
we have absolutely no use for you.

1105
01:36:29,692 --> 01:36:30,901
Look at you.

1106
01:36:33,101 --> 01:36:34,700
Yeah, I was right.

1107
01:36:34,701 --> 01:36:37,478
I think I liked you better when you were a drunk. 

1108
01:36:37,479 --> 01:36:38,479
At least you had some balls then. 

1109
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:39,480
Not like now.

1110
01:36:39,481 --> 01:36:40,481
Tip toeing around like some---

1111
01:36:42,513 --> 01:36:44,058
beggar with your cup out. 

1112
01:36:46,964 --> 01:36:48,163
Take it somewhere else, old man. 

1113
01:36:48,164 --> 01:36:49,164
In fact, you know what?

1114
01:36:49,165 --> 01:36:51,495
Heres a cup. Why dont you take this 

1115
01:36:51,496 --> 01:36:53,659
and go buy some more of your shitty tapes? 

1116
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:57,992
Go back to the room and 
you listen to some more fish stories.. 

1117
01:36:57,993 --> 01:36:58,993
no one gives a shit about. 

1118
01:36:58,994 --> 01:36:59,994
Get outta here. 

1119
01:37:02,573 --> 01:37:03,871
Get the fuck outta here! 

1120
01:38:04,623 --> 01:38:06,847
Ishmael! God pity em!

1121
01:38:06,848 --> 01:38:11,143
 Stop the ship!
 Please stop the ship! 

1122
01:38:17,097 --> 01:38:20,991
Ahab! You Godless sonofabitch! 

1123
01:38:20,992 --> 01:38:26,965
You stop the ship,

1124
01:38:42,495 --> 01:38:50,692
Captain.
 Oh captain. Stop the ship. 

1125
01:39:45,061 --> 01:39:46,287
Were lost. 

1126
01:39:48,359 --> 01:39:49,871
Were all lost, Tommy. 

1127
01:39:52,974 --> 01:39:54,617
Well never make it back.

1128
01:39:57,193 --> 01:39:58,626
Well never make it back.

1129
01:40:17,682 --> 01:40:22,840
I always loved you. 
You know that, dont you Tommy? 

1130
01:40:24,288 --> 01:40:25,859
I always loved you. 

1131
01:40:27,704 --> 01:40:30,739
You and your brother.
 My two  boys. 

1132

<i>Tommy Riordan,

<i> Once again, no walk out music. </i>

1134
01:41:17,550 --> 01:41:19,183
<i>I wouldnt say no walk out music, Sam. </i>

1135

1138

1139
01:42:01,408 --> 01:42:02,408
<i>and turned his life upside down. </i>

1140
01:42:03,890 --> 01:42:07,546
<i>Its been a very long, very miserable 
few months for Mad Dog to say the least. </i>

1141
01:42:09,597 --> 01:42:16,218
<i>Mocking Tommy with a camouflage motif for his mohawk tonight 
and the Marines are really letting Mad Dog have it. </i>

1142
01:42:26,676 --> 01:42:28,219
Alright gentlemen,

- Its not gonna happen again. 

1146

<i>He predicted an early knockout. 
Said he was gonna knock Tommy out with one punch. </i>

1147
01:42:48,698 --> 01:42:50,443
<i>Lets see what Tommy 
has to say about that.</i>

1148

<i>And they are off! </i>

1152

<i>Thats the fastest knockout
 I think Ive ever seen. </i>

<i>Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed. </i>

<i>He is not moving. </i>

1158

<i>You do that to someone on the street and theyd 
lock you up and throw away the key! </i>

1159
01:43:32,443 --> 01:43:33,443
Break out the yellow tape, Sam. 

1160
01:43:34,849 --> 01:43:37,065
<i>This guy's walking away from the cage 
like hes leaving a crime scene. </i>

1161
01:44:30,074 --> 01:44:34,027
<i>Brendan Conlon came into this tournament

You alright with that? 

1169

<i>And here comes the great Russian Koba. </i>

1170
01:45:16,236 --> 01:45:18,398
<i>Koba is so intimidating. </i>

1171
01:45:18,433 --> 01:45:20,323
<i>His reputation is larger than life.</i>

1172
01:45:29,231 --> 01:45:30,972
I want you to look right at him 
when he comes in here. 

1173
01:45:33,142 --> 01:45:34,409
Dont take your eyes off him. 

1174
01:46:03,033 --> 01:46:06,218
Im proud of you brother. 
This is your cage. 

1175

Touch gloves, 
go back, lets do this. 

1179
01:46:40,824 --> 01:46:42,280
<i>Should I be nervous for Brendan?</i>

1180
01:46:42,281 --> 01:46:45,637
<i>Cause I am. I want to stop the 
fight before it gets going.</i>

1181

Why are we here, Brendan?

1197
01:49:12,326 --> 01:49:14,292
You don't knock him out,
you loose the fight.

1198

Do you understand me?

1199
01:49:17,380 --> 01:49:18,426
You don't knock him out,

1200
