1
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:41,082
A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT

2
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:10,275
Saturday the 6th of January, 191 7,

3
00:02:10,527 --> 00:02:14,406
five condemned soldiers
were escorted to Bouchavesnes

4
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,398
at the Front in the Somme.

5
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:25,201
Watch out for the wire!

6
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:49,477
The first,
once cheerful and adventurous,

7
00:02:49,647 --> 00:02:54,357
wore the tag number 21 24.
He was drafted from the Seine area.

8
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:58,318
On his feet were boots,
taken from a dead German.

9
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:02,123
Before becoming 21 24,
he was known as Bastoche

10
00:03:02,287 --> 00:03:04,357
and was hooked on a pretty redhead,

11
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:06,882
a certain Vronique Passavant.

12
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:11,878
He was a carpenter.

13
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:24,197
Taking a break from his woodwork,
they'd go for a beer

14
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:27,086
at Little Louis' bar,
in Golden Hand St.

15
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:33,003
He'd taken his boots from an enemy
who no longer needed them.

16
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:37,160
Stuffed with straw or newspaper,

17
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:39,676
they replaced his old clodhoppers.

18
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:54,637
He was court-martialed
for self-mutilation.

19
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:59,163
Gunpowder had been found
on his wounded hand.

20
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:01,437
He faced the death sentence.

21
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:13,884
Watch out for the wire!

22
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:23,486
The second soldier
was tag number 4077,

23
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:25,478
also from near the Seine.

24
00:04:26,887 --> 00:04:30,482
He was a welder
for the State Railways, in Bagneux.

25
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,837
His name was Francis Gaignard,

26
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,920
nicknamed Six-Sous.

27
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:39,197
He knew the poor build the canons
of their own destruction,

28
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:41,597
but it's the rich who sell them.

29
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:44,282
He tried to explain it to the troops,

30
00:04:44,447 --> 00:04:46,403
but he wasn't a good speaker.

31
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,760
And cheap wine,
poverty's best friend,

32
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:52,122
deadened the soldiers' eyes,

33
00:04:52,287 --> 00:04:54,960
making it difficult
to get through to them.

34
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:42,557
Number 1 81 8 was surely the bravest
and the toughest of them all.

35
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:45,481
He had once
killed a fellow officer...

36
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:50,157
an officer who kicked the dead.

37
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:52,196
Get up!

38
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:53,516
You swines!

39
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,366
You lazy cowards!

40
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,677
You! Get up!

41
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:02,003
Attack! Attack!

42
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:04,604
You! Get going!

43
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:18,001
No one ever found out.

44
00:06:44,247 --> 00:06:47,364
Benot Notre Dame was a farmer
from Dordogne.

45
00:06:47,847 --> 00:06:49,041
One August morning,

46
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:51,522
they came to get him at his farm

47
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:53,564
and sent him off on a train.

48
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:07,680
Watch out for the wire!

49
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:13,640
The telephone wire is the only link
to the land of the living.

50
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:17,561
A flimsy wire, their only chance
for President Poincar's pardon.

51
00:07:17,727 --> 00:07:20,036
Even if the only one
to still believe in it

52
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:24,803
is him.
Number 7328, recruited in Corsica.

53
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:26,844
Angel Bassignano.

54
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:30,722
According to all who'd known him,

55
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:33,321
he was no angel at all.

56
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:37,241
He was a liar, a cheat, a show-off,

57
00:07:37,407 --> 00:07:39,398
a sneak and a troublemaker.

58
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:54,156
Before all this,

59
00:07:54,447 --> 00:07:56,438
Tina Lombardi worked as his whore.

60
00:07:56,607 --> 00:08:00,805
He'd received a 5-year sentence for
an affair of either love or honour,

61
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:02,958
depending on who he was talking to.

62
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:06,756
lt was, in fact, a conflict
between village pimps.

63
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:16,802
Summer 1916,
common-law criminals were enlisted

64
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:20,277
to beef up regiments
melted in the fires at Verdun.

65
00:08:20,447 --> 00:08:21,641
They gave him the choice.

66
00:08:21,847 --> 00:08:23,838
lt's been shitting shells
round here!

67
00:08:24,007 --> 00:08:25,440
No, it's been rather quiet.

68
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,281
Who are those for?

69
00:08:28,327 --> 00:08:31,603
Well, actually...
you'll be attacking tomorrow.

70
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:37,165
We're getting a head start.

71
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:57,725
Watch out for the wire!

72
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:10,366
The fifth was a ''Cornflower'',
the nickname for the class of '1 7.

73
00:09:10,527 --> 00:09:12,836
He was five months shy of 20.

74
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:17,835
These days, everything scared him.

75
00:09:18,047 --> 00:09:19,799
French canons short-firing,

76
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:23,357
the wind that heralded
the mustard gas attacks,

77
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:25,598
executions to set an example.

78
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:28,237
He hadn't been like that before,

79
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:29,681
quite the opposite,

80
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:33,760
braving storms as he helped
lighthouse keepers.

81
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:06,001
And then came one shell too many.

82
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:10,404
There you go... The winning ticket
back to your fiance.

83
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:12,205
The ticket for a court-martial.

84
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:15,643
Turn a blind eye, Sarge.
He's been through enough.

85
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:17,035
They could execute him.

86
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:18,925
- Be human for once.
- Shut up!

87
00:11:19,087 --> 00:11:20,281
Please, Sarge!

88
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,243
Shut up!

89
00:11:27,607 --> 00:11:30,440
The first time
Mathilde and Manech made love,

90
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:33,646
he fell asleep,
his hand on her breast.

91
00:11:55,847 --> 00:11:57,724
Each time his wound throbs,

92
00:11:57,887 --> 00:12:00,765
Manech feels Mathilde's heart
in his palm.

93
00:12:00,927 --> 00:12:03,316
Each beat brings her closer to him.

94
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:10,677
lf Manech were dead,
Mathilde would know.

95
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:13,919
Since the death notice,

96
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:18,126
she stubbornly holds on to her
intuition, like to a flimsy wire.

97
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:20,842
She never gets discouraged.

98
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,476
And Mathilde
is of a cheerful disposition.

99
00:12:25,807 --> 00:12:30,323
lf that wire doesn't lead her
to her lover, never mind...

100
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:32,877
she can always use it as a noose.

101
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:42,765
ln June 1920, Mathilde received
a letter from a nun.

102
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:46,158
A patient at the Rennes hospital
wants to see her.

103
00:12:47,207 --> 00:12:51,598
He'd met Manech in January '1 7
at the Front in the Somme.

104
00:12:57,647 --> 00:12:59,239
August 191 2.

105
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:01,599
Handsome, wasn't l?

106
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:03,322
lt's a De Dion,

107
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:05,646
with direct drive.

108
00:13:06,727 --> 00:13:08,638
Please, tell me about Manech.

109
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:11,006
ln January '1 7,

110
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:14,606
l escorted five condemned soldiers.

111
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,005
He was one of them...

112
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:21,123
Yes.

113
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:24,556
l was to take them
to a front-line trench.

114
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:34,235
Gendarmes were waiting
with the prisoners

115
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:36,677
near a bombed-out cemetery.

116
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:47,836
What are you doing
with those German boots?

117
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:48,917
Waiting.

118
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:50,196
What for?

119
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:52,597
Poincar's pardon? You'll wait!

120
00:13:53,847 --> 00:13:55,326
He'll sign it!

121
00:13:55,647 --> 00:13:57,922
l shouldn't
even have been condemned.

122
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,726
l'm Corsican, not French!

123
00:14:09,487 --> 00:14:10,556
Leave him be.

124
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:13,037
He's lost it,
but that's for the best.

125
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:22,759
Finished, Lieutenant?

126
00:14:25,007 --> 00:14:27,077
The cold has saved that one.

127
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:29,676
Gangrene would've got him
in summer.

128
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:34,641
And Manech?

129
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:37,725
Was he in pain?

130
00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:40,797
They had to cut off two fingers,

131
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,764
but he wasn't suffering anymore.

132
00:14:44,807 --> 00:14:46,365
l led them to a trench,

133
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,563
called ''Bingo Crpuscule''.

134
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:06,475
Bloody hell!

135
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:08,997
Couldn't you have lost them
on your way?

136
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:11,556
A kick in the ass
to get rid of them!

137
00:15:12,247 --> 00:15:14,681
My orders
are to bring you these five.

138
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,360
And l'll tell you my orders!

139
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:19,560
l'm to throw these guys over the top

140
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:21,758
and leave them to die like dogs

141
00:15:21,927 --> 00:15:23,883
between our line and the Jerries'!

142
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:26,436
Those are my damned orders,
Sergeant!

143
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:31,837
You see, Sergeant, with the Jerries,

144
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:34,441
lt's a little too calm?
Let's start the fireworks

145
00:15:34,607 --> 00:15:36,359
and watch all hell let loose!

146
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:41,400
Soup, guys!
You're lucky, it's still warm.

147
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:45,360
Beetroot and fennel.

148
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:53,083
What can l get for you?

149
00:15:54,447 --> 00:15:57,484
A large hot chocolate
and some bread with honey.

150
00:15:57,727 --> 00:16:00,321
l'd kill my parents to get you that!

151
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:02,759
Do you mind, Lieutenant?

152
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:05,645
He's an orphan!

153
00:16:05,927 --> 00:16:09,602
He'll get it. Clestin Poux
is the ''Mess Hall Marauder'',

154
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:11,804
the ''Kitchen Raider''.

155
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:16,324
Fifteen minutes later,
he came back with it all.

156
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:18,245
Salted Gurande butter,

157
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:19,916
lavender honey,

158
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:21,236
and...

159
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,758
cocoa from Nigeria!

160
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:28,797
Grand...

161
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:30,800
Tell me, Cornflower,

162
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:34,205
you've no one to write to?
A fiance?

163
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:36,596
Mathilde.

164
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:39,119
Her name is Mathilde.

165
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:46,880
l hear her heart beating,
like Morse code.

166
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:50,922
We're engaged.

167
00:16:54,407 --> 00:16:58,002
Luckily, we won't have to wait
till the end of the war.

168
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,958
Now l can go straight home
after the execution.

169
00:17:13,647 --> 00:17:15,877
Should l spare you the rest?

170
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:19,524
l'm lame, not dim.

171
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:21,686
What happened?

172
00:17:23,527 --> 00:17:25,643
We opened the barbed wire

173
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:29,200
and equipped the five
against the cold.

174
00:17:32,847 --> 00:17:37,443
Clestin Poux gave up a red woolen
glove to protect your fianc's hand.

175
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:41,282
Are they far?

176
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:44,519
Too far for grenades,
too near for artillery.

177
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:48,157
Gas is out of the question.
The gasser always gets it!

178
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:49,476
Think they'll make it?

179
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:53,117
lf they're not blown to bits,
they'll starve and freeze.

180
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:55,957
Either way, it'll amuse the Jerries.

181
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:04,718
A Corporal gave Bastoche,
the carpenter, a hug.

182
00:18:05,327 --> 00:18:06,840
lt was Corporal Gordes.

183
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:09,482
They clearly knew each other
before the war.

184
00:18:10,207 --> 00:18:11,117
And then,

185
00:18:11,687 --> 00:18:13,359
over they went.

186
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:19,078
- Shit...
- Shut up.

187
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:29,445
- Shit!
- Shut up!

188
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,715
September '1 4.

189
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,605
150 pound weight, easy!

190
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:39,642
And l wasn't at my best!

191
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:41,395
But that morning,

192
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:44,715
in January '1 7,
was Manech still alive?

193
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:48,802
At dawn,
Favart called out their names.

194
00:18:50,687 --> 00:18:53,838
Apart from the Dordogne farmer,
they all replied.

195
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,201
Bassignano!

196
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,322
Sir!

197
00:18:56,487 --> 00:18:57,442
Bouquet!

198
00:18:57,607 --> 00:18:58,960
What now?

199
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:00,841
Langonnet!

200
00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:02,966
Yeah, still here!

201
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:05,886
The Cornflower,
hide yourself better.

202
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:07,766
Notre Dame!

203
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:13,516
That's all l know.

204
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,398
l wrote up my report
with a heavy heart.

205
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,205
About time, Esperanza! The Brits
are replacing us, we're off.

206
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,278
So, Bingo-thingy?

207
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:30,837
What's that?

208
00:19:31,007 --> 00:19:34,283
The condemned prisoners' list,
signed by Capt. Favourier.

209
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:35,800
Give it to me.

210
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:49,081
Don't just stand there like that.
This isn't Pompeii!

211
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:52,246
You've been promoted.
You're off to the Vosges.

212
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:53,886
Even so, Sir,

213
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:56,925
this expedition is going to be
hard to swallow.

214
00:19:57,087 --> 00:19:58,042
Lucky you.

215
00:19:58,207 --> 00:20:01,040
Where you're going, there's
mustard gas and throat lozenges.

216
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:02,720
The famous Vosges sweets.

217
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:03,763
Dismissed!

218
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:07,164
A few months later,
l was wounded, in the Somme.

219
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:10,919
l ended up in the same ambulance
as Chardolot,

220
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:13,682
a corporal from Bingo Crpuscule.

221
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:17,077
But he only had
a few days left to live.

222
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,445
lt's me. Esperanza.

223
00:20:24,127 --> 00:20:25,526
Bingo Crpuscule, remember?

224
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:28,804
Sorry, l don't recognize you.

225
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:32,079
The five thrown over
into no-man's-land,

226
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:34,200
what happened to them?

227
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:35,642
What do you think?

228
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:38,235
No one made it.

229
00:20:38,727 --> 00:20:41,525
Your conscience bothering you,
Esperanza?

230
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:43,957
You should've stuck around.

231
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:47,564
You'd have seen capital Ms,

232
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:50,924
underwear being waved
and a flying albatross.

233
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:54,477
You're delirious with fever!

234
00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:59,957
We sent over five men
and recovered five stiffs.

235
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,322
Conclusion...

236
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:08,886
My eyes are gone but l can imagine
your expression and l like it.

237
00:21:10,567 --> 00:21:13,764
He really spoke of capital Ms
and an albatross?

238
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:16,840
And underwear.

239
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,926
Here you go, Miss.

240
00:21:20,087 --> 00:21:20,837
ln here

241
00:21:21,007 --> 00:21:25,205
are the prisoners' belongings
l was to return to their families.

242
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:28,277
My health's prevented it.

243
00:21:29,607 --> 00:21:32,599
That's the letter
the Dordogne farmer, Notre Dame,

244
00:21:32,767 --> 00:21:33,483
wrote to his wife.

245
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:36,486
l sent the original
just after Bingo.

246
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:39,797
You're here
because of the mustard gas?

247
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,201
Not even. Damned Spanish flu!

248
00:21:44,207 --> 00:21:47,882
Death moves in mysterious ways.

249
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:55,717
lf you can't cry, try talking.

250
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,319
lf you can't talk, say nothing.

251
00:22:01,927 --> 00:22:05,681
But sometimes,
talking can bring on the tears.

252
00:22:05,847 --> 00:22:07,917
Tears say what you can't say,

253
00:22:08,087 --> 00:22:09,759
if you get my drift?

254
00:22:12,847 --> 00:22:15,486
Otherwise,
you can just keep that sour-face!

255
00:22:46,087 --> 00:22:48,442
Little Louis,
tell Vro l'm thinking of her.

256
00:22:48,607 --> 00:22:50,563
Shame she won't talk to me.

257
00:22:50,727 --> 00:22:52,877
Saw Biscuit, we patched things up.

258
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:54,844
Adieu, my friend. Bastoche.

259
00:22:59,407 --> 00:23:03,559
''Benoit Notre Dame, number 1818.
l won't be writing for a long time.''

260
00:23:03,727 --> 00:23:06,605
Tell old Bernay
l want to settle up by March.

261
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:09,998
His manure's too costly,
watch out for him.

262
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:12,483
Tell my Baptistin that l so love

263
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:15,560
that he'll be fine
if he listens to his dear mother.

264
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:19,203
She's the kindest person l know.
Love you. Benot.

265
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:24,797
''For Tina Lombardi,
from Angel Bassignano.''

266
00:24:04,647 --> 00:24:08,799
lf Chickpea comes in before
dinner's called, Manech is alive.

267
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:18,563
l'm not hungry.

268
00:24:23,287 --> 00:24:24,845
Dinner's ready.

269
00:24:26,687 --> 00:24:28,086
Mathilde, dinner!

270
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,716
Coming!

271
00:24:31,167 --> 00:24:33,727
Mathilde was born
the 1 st of January, 1900.

272
00:24:33,967 --> 00:24:36,322
lt's easy for calculating her age.

273
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:40,526
ln 1903, her parents died
in the n 44 bus accident.

274
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,403
Since then,

275
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:43,319
Mathilde often says to herself,

276
00:24:43,487 --> 00:24:46,206
''Ashes to ashes, dust to dust!
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust...''

277
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,641
Her uncle and aunt,

278
00:24:53,807 --> 00:24:56,958
Sylvain and Bndicte,
have raised her,

279
00:24:57,127 --> 00:25:02,121
with her parents' life insurance
invested by Pierre-Marie Rouvire.

280
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:06,397
When she was five,
Mathilde came down with polio.

281
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:08,603
She was bedridden for months,

282
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:11,042
despite mustard compresses...

283
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:12,916
pendulums

284
00:25:13,127 --> 00:25:14,879
and four-leaf clover infusions.

285
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:20,278
Today, Mathilde is twenty.

286
00:25:20,447 --> 00:25:21,880
She plays the tuba.

287
00:25:22,047 --> 00:25:25,835
lt is the only instrument capable
of imitating a distress call.

288
00:25:27,327 --> 00:25:30,603
Chickpea, the dog,
farts in his sleep.

289
00:25:31,087 --> 00:25:34,238
When she hears it,
Bndicte never fails to say,

290
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,159
Doggie fart, gladdens my heart.

291
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,795
Mathilde needs daily treatment.

292
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:42,801
Since the Armistice, Georges Cornu,
a swimming champion,

293
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:44,116
massages her.

294
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:48,479
She used to get embarrassed,
but she got over it.

295
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:52,117
Mathilde sometimes imagines
that Georges admires her,

296
00:25:52,287 --> 00:25:53,686
tormented with desire.

297
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:55,803
What's more, he once said,

298
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:58,162
You do have a fine figure, Miss.

299
00:25:58,327 --> 00:26:00,795
And l've kneaded quite a few.

300
00:26:03,447 --> 00:26:06,086
After that,
how should she call him?

301
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:07,316
Dear Georges...

302
00:26:09,007 --> 00:26:10,235
My dear Georges...

303
00:26:12,607 --> 00:26:13,722
Jojo...

304
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:16,719
Sometimes,
before falling asleep,

305
00:26:16,887 --> 00:26:20,038
she imagines herself
in arousing situations.

306
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:27,726
Mathilde doesn't need
to fantasize for very long

307
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:30,003
before reaching fulfilment.

308
00:26:31,727 --> 00:26:33,160
Since his disappearance,

309
00:26:33,327 --> 00:26:37,161
she can't bear to think about her
fianc as she satisfies herself.

310
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:38,641
That's the way it is...

311
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:48,156
lf l were you, Mathilde,
l'd forget him.

312
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:50,485
Why chase pipe dreams?

313
00:26:50,647 --> 00:26:53,923
lf he was alive,
you'd have heard from him.

314
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:55,766
He was taken prisoner.

315
00:26:56,487 --> 00:27:00,480
And stayed with a German girl
with braids and big boobs!

316
00:27:00,647 --> 00:27:03,241
A Breton boy eating sauerkraut!

317
00:27:03,407 --> 00:27:04,157
lmpossible!

318
00:27:06,047 --> 00:27:09,039
- Can l help?
- Keep your feet on the ground.

319
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:10,879
l stand on my own two feet!

320
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,321
- What?
- Never mind.

321
00:27:12,487 --> 00:27:13,886
l heard you anyway.

322
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:16,398
But your dreams don't stand up.

323
00:27:18,247 --> 00:27:19,965
Manech
can't have been taken at Bingo.

324
00:27:20,127 --> 00:27:22,925
Our men took the trench facing it.

325
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:25,603
Normally, it's the winners

326
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:27,086
who take prisoners.

327
00:27:27,247 --> 00:27:28,760
So he's lost his mind.

328
00:27:28,927 --> 00:27:31,964
Or he's in hiding,
to avoid hard labour.

329
00:27:32,207 --> 00:27:34,437
Stop dreaming, Mathilde!

330
00:27:35,127 --> 00:27:36,242
Face up to it.

331
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:38,967
You'll find a husband, despite...

332
00:27:43,727 --> 00:27:45,399
Something's off-key.

333
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:50,086
l'll find the ''Mess Hall Marauder'',
Clestin Poux.

334
00:27:50,247 --> 00:27:51,805
What can l get for you?

335
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:55,562
Or the Corsican's whore.
She might know more than me.

336
00:27:56,047 --> 00:27:57,162
Tomorrow, l go to Paris.

337
00:27:58,807 --> 00:27:59,523
What for?

338
00:27:59,687 --> 00:28:01,917
To find a survivor
from Bingo Crpuscule.

339
00:28:09,127 --> 00:28:13,040
Germain Pire, Private Detective
The Peerless Pry

340
00:28:16,407 --> 00:28:19,160
l'm used to handling
red-hot affairs.

341
00:28:19,327 --> 00:28:20,601
l've a cupboard full.

342
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:23,804
Scandals that would've been
brushed under the carpet...

343
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:26,606
brought to light by Pire's prying.

344
00:28:28,127 --> 00:28:29,924
Take this big affair...

345
00:28:30,287 --> 00:28:31,925
very delicate.

346
00:28:32,207 --> 00:28:36,962
ln '1 7, a train derails.
425 soldiers on leave, dead.

347
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:41,046
The enquiry reveals how
an officer ordered the departure,

348
00:28:41,207 --> 00:28:43,596
despite faulty brakes.

349
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,919
A total cover-up
by Poincar's government.

350
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:51,242
The victims' families only hope
of finding the officer?

351
00:28:52,287 --> 00:28:53,356
Germain Pire!

352
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:55,716
The Peerless Pry.

353
00:28:55,887 --> 00:28:58,879
Peerless, Miss.
l found their officer,

354
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:01,522
to the military's great displeasure.

355
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:04,401
Granted, he was dead and buried.

356
00:29:05,127 --> 00:29:09,279
l'll just pack my bags and be on
my way to track down Poux Clestin

357
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:10,880
and the Corsican's fiance.

358
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:13,078
And your fees, Mr. Peerless Pry?

359
00:29:14,247 --> 00:29:18,445
The Pry only bleeds dry
sitting ducks, Miss.

360
00:29:19,127 --> 00:29:21,322
For you, l can do...

361
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,640
20 francs a day.

362
00:29:24,127 --> 00:29:25,958
Plus expenses, of course.

363
00:29:26,487 --> 00:29:27,681
Why so kind?

364
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:31,997
Hlne, come and say hello.

365
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:35,719
Don't worry about expenses.
Germain Pire eats little,

366
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:38,924
doesn't drink and tips sparingly.

367
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:47,922
Notre Dame de Paris?

368
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:49,998
Not Notre Dame de Paris!

369
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:52,840
l'm calling from Paris
about Notre Dame Benot!

370
00:29:53,287 --> 00:29:54,640
Benoit Notre Dame!

371
00:29:54,807 --> 00:29:56,399
A strapping,
good-hearted farmer.

372
00:29:57,127 --> 00:29:58,355
Died for his country.

373
00:29:58,687 --> 00:30:00,678
l've lost many a parishioner.

374
00:30:01,447 --> 00:30:03,722
Are his wife and Baptistin
still there?

375
00:30:04,087 --> 00:30:06,806
Quiet!
Miss Minet, l can't hear a thing!

376
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:10,956
No. She upped and left one day,
with no forwarding address.

377
00:30:11,887 --> 00:30:13,206
ls that a choir l hear?

378
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:16,996
Of course, it's a choir!
We are in a church, Miss!

379
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:19,237
But that's no hymn at your end!

380
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:23,357
Thank you, Father. Goodbye.

381
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:26,886
Bingo Crpuscule!

382
00:30:27,447 --> 00:30:29,324
l can't make head nor tail of it!

383
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:32,436
l thought you liked defending
lost causes.

384
00:30:33,687 --> 00:30:36,759
Your impertinence
was charming at 10, not at 20!

385
00:30:36,927 --> 00:30:38,326
Then start taking me seriously.

386
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:42,356
You're wasting your money
on a grotesque crusade!

387
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:45,681
Bingo Crpuscule!
Why not Yippee doodle-doo?

388
00:30:46,807 --> 00:30:48,684
l want access to army archives.

389
00:30:52,247 --> 00:30:54,477
Let's say
there's an ounce of truth in this.

390
00:30:54,647 --> 00:30:57,241
lf one man has survived,
he risks hard labour!

391
00:30:57,407 --> 00:30:58,681
And you know it!

392
00:30:58,847 --> 00:31:01,600
Your prying would put him
in great danger!

393
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:04,160
Be reasonable.

394
00:31:04,927 --> 00:31:06,679
Your parents entrusted me...

395
00:31:06,847 --> 00:31:07,996
''Ashes to ashes...''

396
00:31:08,527 --> 00:31:09,801
That's just it.

397
00:31:10,727 --> 00:31:13,082
They entrusted you
with my happiness.

398
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,322
Goodbye.

399
00:31:19,207 --> 00:31:21,482
Thank you, Pierre-Marie.

400
00:31:24,207 --> 00:31:27,483
Don't be like that,
my dear Mathilde.

401
00:31:28,207 --> 00:31:30,163
l'm thinking of your future.

402
00:31:30,727 --> 00:31:34,879
Sorry to see your health's worsened,
despite the massages.

403
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:38,684
l'll see what l can do.

404
00:31:53,687 --> 00:31:55,723
lt doesn't only happen in Lourdes!

405
00:32:21,487 --> 00:32:25,241
l'm looking for Tina Lombardi.
l knew her when she was little...

406
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:32,799
Ladies, l'm Tina Lombardi's uncle

407
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:35,162
and l'd like to know...

408
00:32:42,247 --> 00:32:43,441
Excuse me...

409
00:32:43,607 --> 00:32:46,883
l look after
the Lombardi family's interests

410
00:32:47,047 --> 00:32:48,526
and l'm looking for Tina.

411
00:32:48,687 --> 00:32:51,679
She's come into some money.

412
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:04,402
You're the one
looking for Tina Lombardi?

413
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:06,116
Well, actually...

414
00:33:12,487 --> 00:33:14,443
Ever been to Corsica?

415
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:17,875
Very pretty, very picturesque.

416
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,164
But Tina's walking the street

417
00:33:20,327 --> 00:33:21,316
somewhere else.

418
00:33:21,487 --> 00:33:24,445
Luckily,
a highly-placed member of the Police

419
00:33:24,607 --> 00:33:26,723
picked up her trail in Bar-Le-Duc.

420
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:30,357
Valentina Emilia Maria Lombardi,
aka Tina,

421
00:33:30,527 --> 00:33:32,882
was registered in 1916

422
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:36,676
near the 23rd regiment's camp
of Marseilles.

423
00:33:38,047 --> 00:33:41,244
Since the Armistice,
the chick has flown the coop!

424
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:43,159
l've lost her trail,
but l've been busy.

425
00:33:56,807 --> 00:33:59,162
She's disappeared into thin air.

426
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:01,321
So, you're giving up.

427
00:34:01,487 --> 00:34:02,476
Not at all.

428
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,526
Pire never admits defeat.
Pire is stubborn.

429
00:34:05,687 --> 00:34:07,882
Pire's peer doesn't exist.

430
00:34:08,887 --> 00:34:10,798
Perfect! Thank you.

431
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:36,559
Just a little bit.

432
00:34:49,607 --> 00:34:51,006
Not my eyes.

433
00:35:16,327 --> 00:35:17,840
Careful with that!

434
00:36:13,527 --> 00:36:14,676
What can l get you?

435
00:36:17,847 --> 00:36:18,916
This is my fianc.

436
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:21,763
And him,

437
00:36:21,927 --> 00:36:23,155
the carpenter...

438
00:36:23,327 --> 00:36:24,806
l think you know him.

439
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:32,886
My throat's dry.

440
00:36:33,087 --> 00:36:36,284
- ''Good glass of wine...''
- ''Keeps the doctor in line.''

441
00:36:37,087 --> 00:36:38,725
My great-aunt's motto.

442
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:41,481
Died in 191 1 in Besanon,
she was 99.

443
00:36:41,887 --> 00:36:43,366
Never sick a day...

444
00:36:48,367 --> 00:36:49,402
Good luck.

445
00:36:49,647 --> 00:36:51,000
Touch wood.

446
00:36:52,727 --> 00:36:53,842
The war?

447
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:59,522
A hyena in the Botanical Gardens.

448
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:01,723
l was showing off, stroking it.

449
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:04,117
Bastoche and Biscuit made this.

450
00:37:04,967 --> 00:37:05,956
Biscuit?

451
00:37:06,247 --> 00:37:08,681
His best friend. They met in 1910

452
00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:11,805
during the floods,
saving a lady's life.

453
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:13,926
Bastoche was talented

454
00:37:14,087 --> 00:37:16,601
but Biscuit... a genius.

455
00:37:16,847 --> 00:37:18,963
A magician with a chisel!

456
00:37:20,487 --> 00:37:23,126
He pegged all the articulations.

457
00:37:28,047 --> 00:37:29,241
This is for you.

458
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,922
''Louis,
tell Vro l'm thinking of her.

459
00:37:32,087 --> 00:37:33,884
''Shame she won't talk to me.

460
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:36,515
''Saw Biscuit, we patched things up.

461
00:37:37,607 --> 00:37:39,916
''Adieu, my friend. Bastoche.''

462
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:46,356
To patch things up means
they'd argued. You know why?

463
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:47,718
A mystery.

464
00:37:49,607 --> 00:37:51,802
They went through hell together,

465
00:37:52,247 --> 00:37:55,000
the Marne, the Wovre, the Somme...

466
00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:59,162
Then one day, and who knows why,
they stopped talking.

467
00:38:01,247 --> 00:38:02,726
Biscuit was transferred.

468
00:38:02,887 --> 00:38:06,766
He died
in a military hospital bombing.

469
00:38:08,847 --> 00:38:11,281
l'm glad they finally
patched things up.

470
00:38:14,287 --> 00:38:17,643
They won't be queuing up outside,
today.

471
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,076
Pour me one?

472
00:38:19,487 --> 00:38:21,000
She's thirsty!

473
00:38:23,807 --> 00:38:25,684
A wooden hand, a heart of gold.

474
00:38:26,247 --> 00:38:27,475
To love.

475
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:28,802
True love!

476
00:38:28,967 --> 00:38:30,400
But who was Vro?

477
00:38:30,967 --> 00:38:34,084
Vronique Passavant.
His regular, his woman.

478
00:38:34,247 --> 00:38:35,760
They often came in together.

479
00:38:36,007 --> 00:38:38,157
Why would they have argued?

480
00:38:38,487 --> 00:38:41,285
He may have strayed
and she wouldn't forgive him.

481
00:38:48,287 --> 00:38:50,403
There you go. '1 7, this way.

482
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:54,406
What exactly are the red files?

483
00:38:54,807 --> 00:38:55,796
Secret defence.

484
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,083
You need a mandate
from someone high up.

485
00:38:58,247 --> 00:38:59,566
Of course, they're upstairs!

486
00:38:59,727 --> 00:39:00,921
Go and help him.

487
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:06,726
Let's say
you were someone high up...

488
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:09,526
then you could give us the mandate.

489
00:39:09,687 --> 00:39:12,759
lf l thought like that,
l wouldn't be an officer.

490
00:39:12,927 --> 00:39:16,476
Consider yourself lucky
you've been allowed in.

491
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:18,923
lt usually takes months.

492
00:39:20,007 --> 00:39:22,567
lt looks tidy
but it's really a mess.

493
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,765
So, the Somme...

494
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:28,044
The Bouchavesnes sector,
trench 108.

495
00:39:29,647 --> 00:39:30,682
What a state...

496
00:39:31,047 --> 00:39:32,799
Look at this. Appalling!

497
00:39:34,647 --> 00:39:35,602
May l help?

498
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:38,884
Thank you for replying favourably
to the General...

499
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:40,998
We're very good friends.

500
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:44,204
Bouchavesnes...
two friends of mine died there.

501
00:39:45,327 --> 00:39:47,158
Dreadful,
the battles in that trench...

502
00:39:47,327 --> 00:39:49,204
Paris wasn't much better.

503
00:39:49,447 --> 00:39:51,756
Couldn't even find a taxi
after the opera.

504
00:39:52,087 --> 00:39:53,236
So l heard!

505
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:56,080
We'd like information on trench 108.

506
00:39:56,567 --> 00:39:59,843
Posting slips, trenches 104, 105.

507
00:40:00,207 --> 00:40:02,402
Trench 107. Where's 106?

508
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:05,397
Trench 108.

509
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:08,483
How annoying,
it's written on both sides!

510
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,486
Trench 108.

511
00:40:12,647 --> 00:40:16,242
''Dug by the Germans,
taken by us in 1916 and renamed

512
00:40:16,407 --> 00:40:18,557
''Bingo Crpuscule.''
Why not Yippee doodle-doo?

513
00:40:19,847 --> 00:40:21,519
''January 6th, nothing to report.

514

00:40:33,847 --> 00:40:35,041
Strange.

519

Certain losses
are filed confidential.

520
00:40:37,647 --> 00:40:40,036
Confidential? You mean...

521
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:41,796
Sorry.

522
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:43,802
Can't you...

523
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:46,037
Sorry, we can't look any further.

524
00:40:47,767 --> 00:40:49,883
Not even the General.

525
00:40:50,487 --> 00:40:51,158
Please.

526
00:41:00,647 --> 00:41:03,241
Thank you for the time you've taken.

527
00:41:03,407 --> 00:41:04,476
You're welcome.

528
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:11,399
Nothing here of interest.
Posting slips, commissary bills.

529
00:41:11,567 --> 00:41:12,761
The routine.

530
00:41:12,927 --> 00:41:14,565
l assumed as much.

531
00:41:14,727 --> 00:41:16,365
lt was to be expected.

532
00:41:20,127 --> 00:41:21,685
You've gone too far!

533
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:31,920
l do hope this paper
wasn't filed secret defence!

534
00:41:38,047 --> 00:41:40,277
You must tell me if it's important.

535
00:41:40,447 --> 00:41:41,800
lt's nothing.

536
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,078
Just a leave.

537
00:41:45,487 --> 00:41:46,840
From the President?

538
00:41:47,647 --> 00:41:48,762
That's right.

539
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:50,605
President Poincar
sometimes granted a leave

540
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:52,246
to a deserving soldier.

541
00:41:53,047 --> 00:41:54,082
End of story!

542
00:41:54,527 --> 00:41:55,926
l'll see you out.

543
00:42:18,047 --> 00:42:19,799
Corporal Bouquet Klber...

544
00:42:20,327 --> 00:42:22,158
Corporal Gaignard Francis...

545
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:25,042
Private Notre Dame Benot...

546
00:42:25,207 --> 00:42:27,562
Private Bassignano Angel...

547
00:42:27,847 --> 00:42:30,122
Private Langonnet Manech...

548
00:42:30,367 --> 00:42:33,643
For self-mutilation,
you are sentenced to death.

549
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:40,399
lf, before the count of 7,
the train hasn't entered the tunnel,

550
00:42:40,567 --> 00:42:42,717
or the ticket inspector hasn't come,

551
00:42:42,887 --> 00:42:44,445
Manech is dead!

552
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:48,801
1 , 2, 3,

553
00:42:49,927 --> 00:42:54,079
4, 5, 6...

554
00:42:55,247 --> 00:42:56,316
Ticket, please!

555
00:42:56,967 --> 00:42:58,719
April fool!

556
00:43:16,487 --> 00:43:19,524
When the newspaper strike is over,
we can place your ad.

557
00:43:19,687 --> 00:43:23,805
''Reward for information concerning
Bingo Crpuscule.''

558
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:26,720
Encouraging her
won't bring back her appetite.

559
00:43:26,887 --> 00:43:28,479
Take her to the Quimper Fair.

560
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,046
What for?

561
00:43:30,247 --> 00:43:31,521
A change of scenery.

562
00:43:32,207 --> 00:43:34,118
You might meet a nice boy.

563
00:43:34,367 --> 00:43:35,595
What for?

564
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:39,317
To get married and have children.
Tell her!

565
00:43:39,487 --> 00:43:41,000
Can you pour me one?

566
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:42,156
You drink now?

567
00:43:42,567 --> 00:43:44,876
''Glass of wine
keeps the doctor in line.''

568
00:43:45,647 --> 00:43:46,682
Where's that from?

569
00:43:46,847 --> 00:43:49,077
Dead-Hand barman
with a wooden hand.

570
00:43:49,247 --> 00:43:52,637
His aunt's motto. Died at a hundred,
in Besanon, 191 1 .

571
00:43:53,207 --> 00:43:54,037
Repeat that?

572
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:57,603
ln Besanon, in 191 1 ,

573
00:43:58,087 --> 00:44:00,999
a 99 year-old lady left behind
a wooden-handed nephew,

574
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:04,045
owner of the Dead-Hand bar,
in Golden Hand St,

575
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:06,721
to whom she often said
what Sylvain just asked me.

576
00:44:07,767 --> 00:44:09,246
She's already drunk!

577
00:44:44,967 --> 00:44:45,956
Look!

578
00:44:48,207 --> 00:44:49,845
An albatross is stubborn.

579
00:44:52,007 --> 00:44:54,237
He knows he can outlast the wind.

580
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:42,759
Hey, my gravel!

581
00:45:43,527 --> 00:45:44,437
My gravel!

582
00:45:46,727 --> 00:45:49,525
Vronique Passavant,
1 7th of July, 1920.

583
00:45:49,687 --> 00:45:53,316
l'm writing from Little Louis' bar.
He told me about you.

584
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:55,842
l must tell you about an encounter

585
00:45:56,007 --> 00:45:57,360
which left me quite shaken up.

586
00:45:57,647 --> 00:46:00,798
l headed for Bastoche's workshop.
l was feeling down.

587
00:46:01,447 --> 00:46:03,119
l want to talk to Bastoche.

588
00:46:03,967 --> 00:46:05,082
Bastoche?

589
00:46:05,247 --> 00:46:09,126
He died. At the Front in the Somme.
Didn't you know?

590
00:46:09,287 --> 00:46:10,845
l know something else.

591
00:46:11,087 --> 00:46:12,156
What?

592
00:46:12,847 --> 00:46:16,203
From the hospital,
where l care for dying syphilitics,

593
00:46:16,567 --> 00:46:18,398
a patient sends you this.

594
00:46:20,807 --> 00:46:24,356
lf you don't want to die, covered
with oozing sores, answer me!

595
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:27,601
The comrade hiding
with your Bastoche...

596
00:46:27,847 --> 00:46:29,041
Tell me...

597
00:46:29,207 --> 00:46:31,004
tell me he's Corsican.

598
00:46:31,807 --> 00:46:35,197
l was already traumatized by nuns
when l was little!

599
00:46:36,367 --> 00:46:39,200
Tina Lombardi
knows something we don't.

600
00:46:40,407 --> 00:46:41,522
What?

601
00:46:41,687 --> 00:46:43,166
The Lombardi girl...

602
00:46:43,487 --> 00:46:45,876
she knows something we don't.

603
00:46:46,927 --> 00:46:50,363
That would prove
Bastoche had escaped.

604
00:46:50,967 --> 00:46:52,923
With another condemned prisoner.

605
00:46:53,287 --> 00:46:56,085
That hussy obviously thinks
it's her Angel.

606
00:46:56,247 --> 00:47:01,082
But if Bastoche had escaped,
he'd have looked out for Manech.

607
00:47:01,447 --> 00:47:02,596
lf he escaped...

608
00:47:02,767 --> 00:47:03,722
Give me that.

609
00:47:04,327 --> 00:47:07,046
With ''ifs'',
a flea could carry an elephant.

610
00:47:07,207 --> 00:47:08,401
Maybe.

611
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:11,161
But without ''ifs'',
might as well hang myself.

612
00:47:18,647 --> 00:47:21,639
Thanks to you, l spend my time
picking gravel out of the lawn!

613
00:47:22,327 --> 00:47:25,364
When l see gravel, l make it a point
of arriving in style.

614
00:47:25,527 --> 00:47:26,437
For the Miss.

615
00:47:26,727 --> 00:47:29,639
Leprince Hardware,
Paris, 25th of July, 1920.

616
00:47:29,887 --> 00:47:33,038
Sunday lends itself to writing.
l'm replying regarding

617
00:47:33,207 --> 00:47:35,926
Clestin Poux and other survivors
from Bingo Crpuscule.

618
00:47:36,087 --> 00:47:39,796
l knew the fellow.
The smartest thief l ever met.

619
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:42,435
Thanks to him,
l never went without!

620
00:47:46,487 --> 00:47:48,796
Olivier Nergeton,
Animated Toys.

621
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:51,842
Clestin Poux was our salvation,

622
00:47:52,007 --> 00:47:54,441
aka the Mess Hall Marauder
or Justa Bit More.

623
00:47:54,607 --> 00:47:55,835
He falsified losses,

624
00:47:56,007 --> 00:47:59,283
making up numbers
to give double rations.

625
00:47:59,447 --> 00:48:03,360
lf you should see him,
tell him we'll never forget him.

626
00:48:05,407 --> 00:48:08,638
Etienne Morillon, teacher,
3rd of August, 1920.

627
00:48:08,807 --> 00:48:10,843
He always had us laughing.

628
00:48:11,327 --> 00:48:14,160
He had even trained
the company's mascot for us!

629
00:48:16,967 --> 00:48:18,764
Good morning. What weather!

630
00:48:19,087 --> 00:48:21,396
Germain Pire, private detective.

631
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:23,285
Mathilde has spoken of you.

632
00:48:24,327 --> 00:48:25,237
Sylvain!

633
00:48:25,847 --> 00:48:27,599
Tell Mathilde to come down.

634
00:48:27,767 --> 00:48:29,962
That Mr. Pry is here to see her.

635
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:32,684
Poux's been hopping around.

636
00:48:34,327 --> 00:48:36,841
Two days in Dreux,
then Troyes, Castre,

637
00:48:37,007 --> 00:48:38,281
five days in Ste.

638
00:48:43,047 --> 00:48:45,641
lt'll take luck and patience
to land him.

639
00:48:46,327 --> 00:48:47,123
Too bad.

640
00:48:48,447 --> 00:48:51,007
Hlne, some savoury biscuits.

641
00:48:51,287 --> 00:48:52,686
Taste them.

642
00:48:53,087 --> 00:48:54,486
Tell me what you think.

643
00:48:55,327 --> 00:48:57,363
The kitchen's more comfortable.

644
00:48:57,687 --> 00:48:59,006
Thank you, Bndicte.

645
00:49:01,367 --> 00:49:02,277
l'll leave you.

646
00:49:05,047 --> 00:49:08,437
Poux can't stay in one place,
whereas Tina Lombardi...

647
00:49:08,727 --> 00:49:10,479
she's got us running in circles.

648
00:49:10,767 --> 00:49:13,235
l know.
And she's the queen of disguise.

649
00:49:13,687 --> 00:49:15,120
Anything new on Biscuit?

650
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,004
That's Benjamin Gordes.

651
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,202
The day he won

652
00:49:23,407 --> 00:49:26,922
the Carpentry Prize
for the sixth consecutive year.

653
00:49:31,087 --> 00:49:32,076
That's right.

654
00:49:34,767 --> 00:49:35,563
Biscuit,

655
00:49:35,727 --> 00:49:37,399
Bastoche's best friend,

656
00:49:37,567 --> 00:49:39,364
is none other than Benjamin Gordes.

657
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,764
A soldier from their company

658
00:49:43,927 --> 00:49:47,522
said they were like brothers
before it went sour.

659
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,682
- Why won't you tell me?
- Stop it!

660
00:49:51,887 --> 00:49:52,842
Tell me!

661
00:49:53,687 --> 00:49:55,723
l don't want to fight you,
so stop it!

662
00:49:55,887 --> 00:49:57,843
Why won't you talk?

663
00:49:58,367 --> 00:49:59,766
Whose idea was it?

664
00:50:00,887 --> 00:50:03,640
Mine?
No, it was your idea!

665
00:50:03,807 --> 00:50:04,796
Bastard!

666
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:08,366
lt was his idea!

667
00:50:08,847 --> 00:50:10,917
All because of a woman!

668
00:50:11,567 --> 00:50:15,196
Vronique Passavant
finished with Bastoche in June '16.

669
00:50:15,367 --> 00:50:19,246
And just after, he fought like
a mad dog with Benjamin Gordes.

670
00:50:19,407 --> 00:50:21,443
Don't need to be Pythagoras!

671
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:24,167
They didn't meet again
before Bingo Crpuscule?

672
00:50:24,327 --> 00:50:25,999
Where it all ended!

673
00:50:26,167 --> 00:50:27,964
No, where it all begins, Mr. Pire.

674
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:29,716
Where it all begins...

675
00:50:30,967 --> 00:50:33,879
Tina Lombardi is sure
Bastoche is alive.

676
00:50:34,327 --> 00:50:38,525
What made him different
from the others that evening?

677
00:50:39,567 --> 00:50:41,842
He was the only carpenter?

678
00:50:43,007 --> 00:50:45,726
Something made Bastoche
different from the others.

679
00:50:46,007 --> 00:50:47,281
His German boots!

680
00:50:49,367 --> 00:50:51,403
He was the only one
with German boots!

681
00:50:51,567 --> 00:50:53,364
Of course. You're right!

682
00:50:54,127 --> 00:50:57,915
Tina Lombardi's discovered that
a man with German boots survived!

683
00:50:59,007 --> 00:51:01,396
l bet he was seen with a comrade!

684
00:51:01,567 --> 00:51:04,559
l saw two soldiers
who looked like tramps.

685
00:51:04,727 --> 00:51:06,718
One wore boots taken from a Jerry.

686
00:51:06,887 --> 00:51:08,878
He was holding up the other.

687
00:51:10,847 --> 00:51:15,398
We also know Bastoche had patched
things up with his best friend!

688
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:16,602
Exactly!

689
00:51:16,967 --> 00:51:19,959
Did it change the course of events
that night?

690
00:51:20,727 --> 00:51:22,797
lf l don't break the peel,

691
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:26,876
Gordes managed to save
Bastoche and Manech.

692
00:51:31,647 --> 00:51:34,764
l'm never going to get that pie
in the oven!

693
00:51:34,927 --> 00:51:36,519
l must go back to Paris.

694
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:39,126
l must go back to Paris.

695
00:51:39,887 --> 00:51:43,402
Again?
That money's going up in smoke.

696
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:44,716
''Ashes to ashes...''

697
00:52:21,207 --> 00:52:22,799
Pilot fish!

698
00:52:24,727 --> 00:52:26,160
Excuse me, Elodie Gordes?

699
00:52:26,327 --> 00:52:27,999
Over there, selling carrots.

700
00:52:28,727 --> 00:52:29,921
Thank you.

701
00:52:39,887 --> 00:52:41,115
Never seen him!

702
00:52:43,767 --> 00:52:45,644
Which one don't you know?

703
00:52:45,807 --> 00:52:47,604
Him, by any chance?

704
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:51,239
Why did Bastoche and Biscuit argue?
Was it over you?

705
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:52,442
l have nothing to say!

706
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,757
- l want to know!
- Leave me alone!

707
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,879
They last met at Bingo Crpuscule.

708
00:53:02,407 --> 00:53:05,683
My fianc was also there.
With Bastoche.

709
00:53:06,567 --> 00:53:08,205
ln that shithole of a trench!

710
00:53:08,607 --> 00:53:10,086
l want to understand.

711
00:53:12,567 --> 00:53:14,319
l want to understand!

712
00:53:19,807 --> 00:53:21,286
lt's not what you think.

713
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:25,404
l can't talk about it.
Give me your address.

714
00:53:26,367 --> 00:53:28,119
My spelling's terrible

715
00:53:29,047 --> 00:53:31,083
but l'll explain it all in a letter.

716
00:53:31,247 --> 00:53:32,157
l promise.

717
00:53:53,087 --> 00:53:55,317
Go ahead! My gravel!

718
00:53:57,087 --> 00:53:58,440
Nothing for me?

719
00:53:59,247 --> 00:54:00,282
What?

720
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,800
Nothing for me?

721
00:54:02,327 --> 00:54:03,806
Just the newspaper.

722
00:54:04,247 --> 00:54:07,125
They talk about everything
except Elodie Gordes.

723
00:54:07,287 --> 00:54:08,197
Very funny!

724
00:54:08,367 --> 00:54:11,518
You should read it,
one can learn things!

725
00:54:11,687 --> 00:54:15,805
Has the President opened an inquest
on Bingo Crpuscule?

726
00:54:17,967 --> 00:54:20,401
He might have done,

727
00:54:20,807 --> 00:54:23,924
if he hadn't fallen from a train
in his pyjamas.

728
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:26,322
Well, he wears pyjamas!

729
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:29,123
He wears pyjamas!

730
00:54:44,007 --> 00:54:46,077
We recovered five stiffs.

731
00:54:46,327 --> 00:54:47,806
Conclusion...

732
00:54:58,967 --> 00:55:02,277
We knew you were a thief.
But a pyromaniac?

733
00:55:15,367 --> 00:55:16,322
All for me?

734
00:55:16,487 --> 00:55:18,239
No. Just this one.

735
00:55:18,407 --> 00:55:22,002
lf l'm not picking up gravel,
l'm picking up the postman!

736
00:55:25,327 --> 00:55:27,522
The gravel's gone? A fair fight.

737
00:55:27,687 --> 00:55:29,120
Fighting is never fair.

738
00:55:29,287 --> 00:55:31,676
- Can l offer you a short one?
- Won't say no.

739
00:55:33,007 --> 00:55:36,477
Miss, l beg you to keep my secret
to yourself.

740
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:39,839
When l met my husband,
he already had four children.

741
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:41,281
None were his.

742
00:55:41,447 --> 00:55:43,881
Out of kindness,
he'd married a widow with TB.

743
00:55:44,047 --> 00:55:45,639
She was Polish, like me.

744
00:55:45,847 --> 00:55:47,997
He adopted her children
before her death.

745
00:55:48,167 --> 00:55:50,044
l was also an unmarried mother.

746
00:55:51,567 --> 00:55:54,684
He then found himself
the father of five,

747
00:55:54,847 --> 00:55:56,963
though he couldn't have any
of his own.

748
00:56:03,407 --> 00:56:05,159
You're going to run me over!

749
00:56:05,607 --> 00:56:07,757
We had four years of tenderness.

750
00:56:08,367 --> 00:56:09,277
We had plans.

751
00:56:09,447 --> 00:56:12,041
We dreamt
of seeing the sea together.

752
00:56:12,247 --> 00:56:13,839
Then the war came.

753
00:56:14,807 --> 00:56:17,446
l thought Bastoche
would take care of him,

754
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:18,926
their being posted together.

755
00:56:19,127 --> 00:56:22,085
But during his leave,
in September, 191 5,

756
00:56:22,247 --> 00:56:24,044
just after the battle of Artois,

757
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:27,399
l knew
nothing would ever be the same.

758
00:56:36,407 --> 00:56:38,682
Over there,
it's all we have to keep going.

759
00:56:54,607 --> 00:56:57,440
Once, in a burning field,
l saw some comrades...

760
00:56:57,607 --> 00:57:00,405
Their cartridge belts
exploded like fireworks.

761
00:57:04,567 --> 00:57:08,196
Once, we even had to use
the body of a friend

762
00:57:09,087 --> 00:57:11,078
as a shield.

763
00:57:22,567 --> 00:57:25,035
There had been something
on his mind.

764
00:57:25,527 --> 00:57:27,882
He came out with it
on the second night.

765
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:32,763
lf l desert, the gendarmes
will come and get me.

766
00:57:35,047 --> 00:57:37,880
My only way out
is to have a sixth child.

767
00:57:40,527 --> 00:57:43,997
lf you have six children,
they send you home.

768
00:57:45,327 --> 00:57:47,921
As l said,
he couldn't have children.

769
00:57:48,487 --> 00:57:50,523
l didn't dare think
what was on his mind,

770
00:57:50,687 --> 00:57:52,837
but he just wouldn't let it go.

771
00:57:57,447 --> 00:58:00,359
lt's not betrayal if l'm asking you.

772
00:58:00,527 --> 00:58:02,245
Especially if it's with Bastoche.

773
00:58:03,047 --> 00:58:04,082
Don't touch!

774
00:58:07,767 --> 00:58:10,042
The five aren't mine,
so why not a sixth?

775
00:58:10,207 --> 00:58:13,802
You'd have nine months to wait.
The war will be over by then.

776
00:58:13,967 --> 00:58:15,605
lt will never be over. Never!

777
00:58:15,767 --> 00:58:19,043
They'd be nine months of hope.
Have you no heart?

778
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:23,045
And then one day, l found a note
from Klber Bouquet,

779
00:58:23,207 --> 00:58:24,925
known as Bastoche,

780
00:58:25,087 --> 00:58:29,444
saying to tie a coloured cloth at
the window if he wasn't to come up.

781
00:58:43,407 --> 00:58:44,362
Coffee?

782
00:58:44,527 --> 00:58:46,085
l'd love some!

783
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:47,926
- After you.
- Please.

784
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:57,402
Thank you.

785
00:59:01,007 --> 00:59:01,883
Sugar?

786
00:59:02,047 --> 00:59:03,639
No, thank you.

787
00:59:09,847 --> 00:59:11,075
lt's mother of pearl?

788
00:59:11,727 --> 00:59:13,877
Yes, Benjamin made it.

789
00:59:21,007 --> 00:59:23,885
- lt's odd...
- How strange we never met.

790
00:59:26,127 --> 00:59:28,004
The children aren't here?

791
00:59:28,167 --> 00:59:29,395
Yes, but...

792
00:59:30,087 --> 00:59:31,679
they're playing outside.

793
00:59:37,167 --> 00:59:39,317
- A pick-me-up?
- Please.

794
00:59:39,847 --> 00:59:41,917
No, no... Sorry.

795
00:59:42,447 --> 00:59:44,119
l don't fancy one.

796
00:59:46,687 --> 00:59:48,405
Neither do l.

797
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:52,284
Elodie, we'll say we've done it.

798
00:59:53,447 --> 00:59:55,244
lt'll calm him down.

799
00:59:55,407 --> 00:59:58,205
lt will make things easier
for you, for me...

800
00:59:59,087 --> 01:00:00,406
for everybody.

801
01:01:09,047 --> 01:01:11,959
Funny how your smile
opens the parentheses.

802
01:01:14,647 --> 01:01:16,717
l'll close them
as late as possible...

803
01:01:17,767 --> 01:01:19,917
ln two days, at the train station.

804
01:01:39,407 --> 01:01:40,476
Come on...

805
01:01:41,487 --> 01:01:43,159
give me one last smile.

806
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:47,318
To close the parentheses.

807
01:01:48,647 --> 01:01:50,285
l didn't even get pregnant!

808
01:01:50,767 --> 01:01:53,918
But soon, fear no longer tormented
my husband.

809
01:01:55,047 --> 01:01:56,480
lt was jealousy.

810
01:01:57,567 --> 01:02:00,479
''Where? When? Often?
Which positions?''

811
01:02:00,647 --> 01:02:04,526
''Did you enjoy it?'' lt became
a living hell for both of us.

812
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:08,604
Now, Bastoche is dead,
as you know,

813
01:02:09,167 --> 01:02:12,284
and my husband was killed
in a hospital bombing.

814
01:02:13,007 --> 01:02:17,603
lt's a relief to confide in you.
At times, l think l'm going mad.

815
01:02:17,807 --> 01:02:19,240
Elodie Gordes.

816
01:02:19,767 --> 01:02:21,644
Matti! Hurry up.

817
01:02:21,807 --> 01:02:24,560
Mr. Rouvire is on the phone.
He's waiting.

818
01:02:24,727 --> 01:02:25,876
Come on!

819
01:02:42,207 --> 01:02:44,562
Mathilde? Pierre-Marie here.

820
01:02:45,967 --> 01:02:48,527
l have some bad news.

821
01:02:49,207 --> 01:02:52,961
Not really bad... News you're
already supposed to know.

822
01:02:53,927 --> 01:02:56,441
But news you can no longer ignore.

823
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:00,360
You were right about one thing...

824
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:05,555
Manech and his four comrades
were in that absurdly named trench.

825
01:03:06,647 --> 01:03:09,081
They were buried
in the Herdelin cemetery,

826
01:03:10,487 --> 01:03:15,561
after being temporarily buried
under a tarpaulin in a bomb crater.

827
01:03:16,847 --> 01:03:18,485
That's that, my dear Mathilde.

828
01:03:27,527 --> 01:03:31,600
ln June, 1909,
Mathilde is 9 years old.

829
01:03:32,287 --> 01:03:34,278
Manech Langonnet is 10.

830
01:03:34,447 --> 01:03:36,039
Does it hurt when you walk?

831
01:03:37,407 --> 01:03:39,682
lt's Friday, or Saturday...

832
01:03:40,607 --> 01:03:42,563
Mathilde can't remember.

833
01:03:46,767 --> 01:03:48,120
Do you have any friends?

834
01:03:49,647 --> 01:03:51,683
l can be your friend.

835
01:03:55,607 --> 01:03:57,245
Do l stink of fish?

836
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,597
Ever been
to the top of the lighthouse?

837
01:04:01,247 --> 01:04:03,966
l can carry you
to the top of the stairs.

838
01:04:05,087 --> 01:04:07,760
Because my dad's the keeper!

839
01:04:08,767 --> 01:04:12,282
Be stuck-up then! Church mouse!
Country bumpkin!

840
01:04:12,447 --> 01:04:14,722
Do you want a kick in the pants?

841
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:39,284
Can you see far from the top?

842
01:05:14,527 --> 01:05:17,087
l'm going to gobble up your ears!

843
01:05:21,527 --> 01:05:23,836
l'll throw you in the dungeon!

844
01:05:27,727 --> 01:05:30,560
l am the squid's servant!

845
01:05:43,847 --> 01:05:45,565
Doggie fart, gladdens my heart!

846
01:07:28,967 --> 01:07:31,242
Manech's Marrying Mathilde!

847
01:07:32,527 --> 01:07:35,280
Mathilde's Marrying Manech!

848
01:08:02,527 --> 01:08:05,041
- l don't smoke.
- l know, but take it...

849
01:08:06,967 --> 01:08:08,878
lt'll help you make new friends.

850
01:08:44,127 --> 01:08:46,163
lf l reach the bend before the car,

851
01:08:46,327 --> 01:08:48,204
Manech will come back alive!

852
01:08:50,247 --> 01:08:51,965
lf l reach the bend...

853
01:09:00,847 --> 01:09:02,883
lf l reach the bend
before the car...

854
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:06,484
Manech will come back alive...

855
01:09:12,967 --> 01:09:14,446
lf l reach the bend...

856
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,165
You used to brag
about being one year older than me.

857
01:10:14,567 --> 01:10:16,603
Now l'm older than you.

858
01:10:18,887 --> 01:10:21,355
The man who gave you his glove
is called Poux.

859
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:23,486
Clestin Poux.

860
01:10:23,767 --> 01:10:25,280
Funny, isn't it?

861
01:10:27,567 --> 01:10:31,355
The man l hired to find him is Pire.

862
01:10:32,247 --> 01:10:33,680
Germain Pire.

863
01:10:35,207 --> 01:10:36,560
Strange name, too.

864
01:10:37,327 --> 01:10:40,683
Either way, he hasn't found him.
Nor the Corsican's whore.

865
01:10:43,447 --> 01:10:45,403
The wire's snapped, Manech,

866
01:10:46,487 --> 01:10:47,966
but l'm not giving up.

867
01:10:50,007 --> 01:10:52,601
l still believe
that Tina Lombardi's a lead.

868
01:10:54,527 --> 01:10:56,518
l need to be sure.

869
01:10:56,967 --> 01:10:58,286
You understand, right?

870
01:11:00,327 --> 01:11:03,603
That's why
l must find Clestin Poux.

871
01:11:08,647 --> 01:11:10,842
You can be really annoying,
you know.

872
01:11:13,047 --> 01:11:15,322
We would be
so much better in Brittany.

873
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:20,080
Let's go, Mathilde.

874
01:11:21,727 --> 01:11:23,399
You'll catch cold.

875
01:11:50,327 --> 01:11:51,077
Thouvenel!

876
01:11:55,407 --> 01:11:56,886
What do you want?

877
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:05,806
Who are you?

878
01:12:09,767 --> 01:12:11,598
Was it you who phoned?

879
01:12:13,327 --> 01:12:14,555
Who are you?

880
01:12:41,927 --> 01:12:45,840
The days go by.
Still no news of Clestin Poux.

881
01:12:46,127 --> 01:12:48,038
Mathilde's sadness is overwhelming.

882
01:12:49,247 --> 01:12:51,841
She must eat.
She's making herself ill.

883
01:12:52,007 --> 01:12:53,838
Leave her the marrowbone.

884
01:13:00,327 --> 01:13:03,239
Her sadness is beginning
to rub off on us.

885
01:13:07,767 --> 01:13:08,802
And so,

886
01:13:09,247 --> 01:13:12,319
in the middle of the night
on the 1 5th of September, 1920,

887
01:13:12,567 --> 01:13:14,205
the wire is re-tied.

888
01:13:33,287 --> 01:13:35,801
''Victory!
l've finally found the roaming Poux.

889
01:13:35,967 --> 01:13:38,003
''Sent by the grace of God
and Davidson motors.

890
01:13:38,167 --> 01:13:41,045
''All expenses paid, of course.
Germain Pire.''

891
01:13:43,207 --> 01:13:45,516
Clestin Poux, Terror of the Tarmac!

892
01:13:46,127 --> 01:13:47,446
The ad was yours?

893
01:13:47,607 --> 01:13:50,326
Mathilde tightly clasps her hands,

894
01:13:50,567 --> 01:13:53,035
to keep from shaking and crying

895
01:13:53,327 --> 01:13:55,636
and making a fool of herself.

896
01:13:57,487 --> 01:13:59,523
l didn't actually see
your fianc get hit.

897
01:13:59,687 --> 01:14:00,961
l went to get the stew

898
01:14:01,127 --> 01:14:03,243
and ran into Lebgue,
a guy l met in the Vosges.

899
01:14:03,407 --> 01:14:07,366
A native of the Meuse.
Or rather a nave of the Meuse.

900
01:14:07,567 --> 01:14:10,923
Even so, he could tell good coffee
from a stomach remedy.

901
01:14:11,087 --> 01:14:14,682
l know. l tried to sell him
a mixture of coffee and charcoal

902
01:14:14,847 --> 01:14:16,565
in exchange for
some Dutch tobacco.

903
01:14:16,727 --> 01:14:18,479
So, the last time you saw Manech,

904
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:20,680
he was alive?

905
01:14:22,487 --> 01:14:24,637
You couldn't miss him.

906
01:14:24,807 --> 01:14:26,923
Carving Ms on a burnt tree trunk,

907
01:14:27,287 --> 01:14:29,278
smack in the middle
of no-man's-land.

908
01:14:29,687 --> 01:14:32,884
He carved three Ms
before the albatross got him.

909
01:14:34,727 --> 01:14:35,637
Albatross!

910
01:14:36,167 --> 01:14:37,600
''Albatross.

911
01:14:38,087 --> 01:14:39,998
''Great sweeping sea bird,

912
01:14:40,167 --> 01:14:42,965
''indolent traveling companion,

913
01:14:43,527 --> 01:14:45,324
''gliding with ships

914
01:14:45,487 --> 01:14:47,000
''upon bitter deep.''

915
01:14:48,647 --> 01:14:50,478
lt's a poem by Baudelaire.

916
01:14:50,727 --> 01:14:52,763
lt was also a Jerry bomber.

917
01:14:53,007 --> 01:14:54,725
The machine gun was at the rear.

918
01:14:54,887 --> 01:14:57,447
We couldn't shoot yet
through the propeller.

919
01:15:40,407 --> 01:15:42,602
lt was you who gave him the glove?

920
01:15:44,127 --> 01:15:45,765
A thick woolen red one.

921
01:15:45,967 --> 01:15:49,516
My fiance spent her time
knitting scarves and mittens for me.

922
01:15:49,967 --> 01:15:52,527
l traded them
with frostbitten Senegalese

923
01:15:52,687 --> 01:15:54,962
in exchange for Germans' gold teeth.

924
01:15:55,407 --> 01:15:57,602
l melted them down
after the Armistice.

925
01:15:57,767 --> 01:15:59,086
They paid for my Harley.

926
01:15:59,807 --> 01:16:00,796
But...

927
01:16:01,647 --> 01:16:03,842
are you sure Manech's dead?

928
01:16:05,887 --> 01:16:08,560
A comrade told me,
with a wound like that...

929
01:16:09,007 --> 01:16:10,998
he didn't stand a chance.

930
01:16:12,247 --> 01:16:16,206
l only saw three of them get killed
with my own eyes.

931
01:16:16,487 --> 01:16:17,602
l surrender!

932
01:16:18,567 --> 01:16:19,556
l surrender!

933
01:16:19,767 --> 01:16:20,802
Don't shoot!

934
01:16:21,407 --> 01:16:23,204
l beg you! l surrender!

935
01:16:23,887 --> 01:16:25,559
Let me through!

936
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:27,405
l'm on your side!

937
01:16:33,567 --> 01:16:36,035
l'm not French, l'm Corsican!

938
01:16:36,287 --> 01:16:37,925
l've nothing against you!

939
01:16:38,447 --> 01:16:39,721
Poor bastard.

940
01:16:42,207 --> 01:16:43,686
So, he's not French!

941
01:16:45,127 --> 01:16:46,685
Let's cancel his birth certificate.

942
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:54,637
A French corporal dealt with him...

943
01:16:55,047 --> 01:16:57,845
Thouvenel. A trigger-happy swine!

944
01:16:58,887 --> 01:17:01,560
He had a heart made of stone,
but a sharp eye.

945
01:17:02,807 --> 01:17:04,035
Poor bastard!

946
01:17:05,927 --> 01:17:07,519
l guess you like it.

947
01:17:07,887 --> 01:17:10,003
l'd kill my parents for a good stew!

948
01:17:10,767 --> 01:17:12,200
Don't worry, he's an orphan.

949
01:17:12,367 --> 01:17:14,039
The same goes for truffles.

950
01:17:14,207 --> 01:17:17,483
lf you like truffles,
l have one from Prigord...

951
01:17:17,647 --> 01:17:19,683
Which ones did you see die?

952
01:17:20,687 --> 01:17:22,166
The one with gangrene.

953
01:17:23,487 --> 01:17:24,237
Six-Sous.

954
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,040
Yes, the welder.

955
01:17:27,407 --> 01:17:28,726
Comrades...

956
01:17:29,647 --> 01:17:31,000
Before dying...

957
01:17:31,327 --> 01:17:32,840
l have a final request.

958
01:17:33,727 --> 01:17:35,399
l want to piss standing up.

959
01:17:35,727 --> 01:17:37,160
Like a man!

960
01:17:37,327 --> 01:17:40,956
And then, you can fire away
to your heart's content!

961
01:17:43,927 --> 01:17:48,603
So long to life, so long to love

962
01:17:48,767 --> 01:17:52,476
So long to all those women

963
01:17:53,767 --> 01:17:55,246
lt's all over

964
01:17:55,967 --> 01:17:58,242
Done forever

965
01:17:59,487 --> 01:18:02,399
This shameful war

966
01:18:02,727 --> 01:18:06,561
At Craonne, on the plateau

967
01:18:06,727 --> 01:18:10,436
That's where we'll leave our skins

968
01:18:10,607 --> 01:18:13,679
For we've all been sentenced

969
01:18:14,047 --> 01:18:18,996
We are the sacrificed

970
01:18:26,647 --> 01:18:27,602
And Bastoche?

971
01:18:27,767 --> 01:18:29,439
He was so well hidden,

972
01:18:29,727 --> 01:18:31,479
we couldn't locate him.

973
01:18:31,767 --> 01:18:33,962
Even at dawn,
when he answered roll call,

974
01:18:34,287 --> 01:18:37,597
no one knew where he was.
A ventriloquist!

975
01:18:37,767 --> 01:18:39,519
No, he was a carpenter.

976
01:18:40,087 --> 01:18:40,917
No matter.

977
01:18:41,287 --> 01:18:44,962
He was shot down by the Albatross,
along with your fianc.

978
01:19:07,847 --> 01:19:11,317
The Albatross caught fire
and crashed on the enemy line.

979
01:19:11,487 --> 01:19:12,886
Return to sender.

980
01:19:15,927 --> 01:19:18,282
What about the Dordogne farmer?

981
01:19:18,447 --> 01:19:21,484
He played dead from the beginning.
Not that it saved him.

982
01:19:22,127 --> 01:19:25,403
The Jerries didn't appreciate
the grenade.

983
01:19:25,687 --> 01:19:28,520
Don't look!
lt'll only make it worse.

984
01:19:28,687 --> 01:19:31,997
When l got back with the stew,
bullets were flying everywhere.

985
01:19:32,447 --> 01:19:34,756
Heavy shelling had begun.

986
01:20:03,807 --> 01:20:06,446
Damn! No one can imagine
what it's like.

987
01:20:07,567 --> 01:20:10,764
Can't move your legs, your heart
beats like a scared animal.

988
01:20:45,687 --> 01:20:48,759
Then l saw the Dordogne farmer
shatter into pieces.

989
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:58,042
Attack,
before we're all slaughtered.

990
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:00,798
Prepare bayonets!

991
01:21:14,967 --> 01:21:18,437
All that was nothing
compared to what followed.

992
01:21:19,447 --> 01:21:21,085
For France!

993
01:21:22,007 --> 01:21:23,235
Charge!

994
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:47,320
We'd passed
the five prisoners bodies

995
01:21:47,487 --> 01:21:50,763
when the Jerry machine guns
started spitting bullets.

996
01:21:51,287 --> 01:21:52,481
We were wiped out!

997
01:22:36,967 --> 01:22:40,243
That Lavrouye bastard!
He kept the paper to himself.

998
01:22:40,407 --> 01:22:41,726
Stretcher-bearers!

999
01:22:42,727 --> 01:22:44,683
What paper?

1000
01:22:45,567 --> 01:22:47,000
That's all he said.

1001
01:22:53,247 --> 01:22:56,842
That evening, there was enough food
to feed an army.

1002
01:22:57,327 --> 01:23:00,285
Favart and Chardolot
were counting losses.

1003
01:23:00,687 --> 01:23:03,485
Why do those five
show up on our battalion list?

1004
01:23:04,807 --> 01:23:06,286
We're only following orders.

1005
01:23:06,967 --> 01:23:08,116
Something stinks here.

1006
01:23:08,367 --> 01:23:10,881
Something stinks?
Lavrouye stinks.

1007
01:23:11,047 --> 01:23:14,801
This food doesn't.
Dig in before it gets cold.

1008
01:23:17,847 --> 01:23:19,166
lt's cold!

1009
01:23:20,007 --> 01:23:23,044
So you only saw
three of them get killed.

1010
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:24,196
With your own eyes.

1011
01:23:24,847 --> 01:23:27,998
False hope
will only make you suffer.

1012
01:23:28,167 --> 01:23:29,282
They're not false!

1013
01:23:29,447 --> 01:23:30,846
You'll taste my cake?

1014
01:23:31,007 --> 01:23:32,360
l don't know if l should.

1015
01:23:32,527 --> 01:23:34,245
With a bit of fresh cream.

1016
01:23:34,447 --> 01:23:36,005
lf you insist...

1017
01:23:36,967 --> 01:23:39,037
l like people
who appreciate my food.

1018
01:23:41,327 --> 01:23:42,999
l'll put her to bed.

1019
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:45,604
Let's all get some sleep.

1020
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:07,486
Slow down!

1021
01:24:10,167 --> 01:24:12,317
You lack control, no style...

1022
01:24:12,487 --> 01:24:15,206
You're better at raking
than skidding!

1023
01:24:15,367 --> 01:24:18,120
Hey, Postman! l'll drop you off
at the next letterbox.

1024
01:24:18,287 --> 01:24:19,083
And my bike?

1025
01:24:19,247 --> 01:24:22,603
Leave it to me. l fought in the war!
l don't have a desk job.

1026
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:26,957
lt's not my fault. l'm asthmatic!

1027
01:24:27,127 --> 01:24:28,879
An asthmatic who rides a bike!

1028
01:24:29,047 --> 01:24:31,083
- By the sea.
- Sure, by the sea!

1029
01:24:31,247 --> 01:24:33,363
Clestin, it's not a sidecar.

1030
01:24:34,847 --> 01:24:37,725
Those men, they never grow up...

1031
01:24:37,887 --> 01:24:39,923
As long as they don't play soldiers.

1032
01:24:41,247 --> 01:24:45,445
''Tell old Bernay... settle up
by March. His manure's too costly...''

1033
01:24:45,607 --> 01:24:49,316
He wouldn't write such trivialities.
Don't you agree?

1034
01:24:50,727 --> 01:24:52,445
There must be a code.

1035
01:24:52,607 --> 01:24:53,960
Except lovers' codes

1036
01:24:54,127 --> 01:24:57,597
can't be cracked with brains
or divine intervention.

1037
01:24:59,967 --> 01:25:01,161
And Bastoche?

1038
01:25:01,607 --> 01:25:05,202
lf he was seen with his German
boots, he must have survived.

1039
01:25:05,487 --> 01:25:07,000
Not so, Miss.

1040
01:25:07,207 --> 01:25:10,995
Gordes didn't let him go over
the top with those boots.

1041
01:25:16,927 --> 01:25:18,485
lf the Jerries see these,

1042
01:25:18,887 --> 01:25:21,481
they'll know
you've stripped one of their dead.

1043
01:25:25,927 --> 01:25:28,646
So Tina Lombardi's
on the wrong track.

1044
01:25:30,447 --> 01:25:31,846
The one with the boots

1045
01:25:33,447 --> 01:25:34,766
wasn't Bastoche.

1046
01:25:34,927 --> 01:25:36,280
lt was Gordes!

1047
01:25:36,447 --> 01:25:37,482
That's right, Miss!

1048
01:25:38,447 --> 01:25:40,119
He was with a boy,

1049
01:25:40,287 --> 01:25:41,925
from the class of '1 7...
Desrochelles.

1050
01:25:42,687 --> 01:25:45,884
l'd met some stretcher-bearers
who'd just passed them.

1051
01:25:47,167 --> 01:25:48,486
Are you from Bingo?

1052
01:25:48,887 --> 01:25:50,115
Might be.

1053
01:25:50,287 --> 01:25:52,243
Tell them Gordes is wounded.

1054
01:25:52,407 --> 01:25:55,479
- He's with a boy who's worse off.
- Desrochelles.

1055
01:25:55,647 --> 01:25:57,683
- They're off to first-aid.
- With German boots!

1056
01:25:57,847 --> 01:25:59,041
Long Live Anarchy!

1057
01:26:00,887 --> 01:26:02,286
Anarchy.

1058
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:19,765
What's happened, Matti?

1059
01:26:20,287 --> 01:26:21,436
What did l say?

1060
01:26:23,047 --> 01:26:24,480
Open up!

1061
01:26:26,127 --> 01:26:27,765
Be reasonable.

1062
01:26:27,927 --> 01:26:29,804
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

1063
01:26:31,087 --> 01:26:33,078
You've known he's dead
for three years.

1064
01:26:33,247 --> 01:26:34,680
l call that stubbornness.

1065
01:26:35,007 --> 01:26:36,998
No, l call that hope.

1066
01:26:37,287 --> 01:26:38,720
Poux has just killed it.

1067
01:26:42,047 --> 01:26:44,322
lf l can do anything...

1068
01:26:47,767 --> 01:26:48,563
You can.

1069
01:26:49,767 --> 01:26:51,883
Take me to Bingo Crpuscule.

1070
01:27:05,687 --> 01:27:08,247
An lndian princess on her elephant.

1071
01:27:09,087 --> 01:27:12,966
With her hunters,
on the Trail of Sorrow.

1072
01:27:13,847 --> 01:27:15,200
lt was there!

1073
01:27:15,487 --> 01:27:16,602
Right there!

1074
01:27:18,767 --> 01:27:21,042
At a hundred yards, facing Bingo,

1075
01:27:21,647 --> 01:27:24,366
was Erlangen, the Jerry trench.

1076
01:27:25,007 --> 01:27:27,441
Where's the burnt tree trunk?

1077
01:27:27,607 --> 01:27:30,167
All the stumps and debris

1078
01:27:30,847 --> 01:27:34,078
were used to fill in the trenches.

1079
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:39,126
We found the five over there,
under a tarpaulin,

1080
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:41,323
covered with earth.

1081
01:27:41,687 --> 01:27:43,803
- Not a pretty sight.
- No doubt!

1082
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:46,003
The youngest was only a boy.

1083
01:27:47,447 --> 01:27:49,597
Was he wearing a glove?

1084
01:27:50,047 --> 01:27:51,685
A red, woolen glove?

1085
01:27:51,847 --> 01:27:55,044
They all had
one bandaged hand, but...

1086
01:27:55,207 --> 01:27:58,802
nothing on the other.
l can't remember seeing a glove.

1087
01:27:58,967 --> 01:27:59,683
Athos!

1088
01:28:00,527 --> 01:28:03,280
l don't like him digging like that.

1089
01:28:03,447 --> 01:28:04,721
Around here,

1090
01:28:04,887 --> 01:28:09,119
you never know what junk
you might come across,

1091
01:28:09,287 --> 01:28:11,517
that can blow off an arm or a leg.

1092
01:28:14,167 --> 01:28:15,395
lt's the crypt!

1093
01:28:15,687 --> 01:28:19,157
There was a chapel
between the two trenches.

1094
01:28:19,687 --> 01:28:21,837
lt was in ruins.

1095
01:28:22,007 --> 01:28:24,521
lncredible.
l don't recognize a thing.

1096
01:28:47,527 --> 01:28:50,519
Could Manech have lost the glove
as he fell?

1097
01:28:51,327 --> 01:28:54,046
lt was tightly knitted
and tightly fitted.

1098
01:28:54,207 --> 01:28:58,086
l used the other one in the kitchens
until the end of the war.

1099
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,123
Maybe he took it off to carve?

1100
01:29:02,847 --> 01:29:04,041
l couldn't say.

1101
01:29:04,407 --> 01:29:05,965
But l don't think so.

1102
01:29:06,447 --> 01:29:08,961
What sort of red was it? Bright red?

1103
01:29:10,167 --> 01:29:11,202
A flashy red.

1104
01:29:12,127 --> 01:29:15,563
With white dots.
Looked like maggots on an apple!

1105
01:29:29,167 --> 01:29:31,158
Sorry to disturb you like this.

1106
01:29:31,327 --> 01:29:34,922
My husband's family
suffered greatly in the war.

1107
01:29:35,087 --> 01:29:37,123
l didn't want to go over

1108
01:29:37,287 --> 01:29:40,245
to a French soldier's table
in front of him.

1109
01:29:42,167 --> 01:29:43,646
What can you tell me?

1110
01:29:44,287 --> 01:29:46,437
Before dying, my brother Gunther

1111
01:29:46,607 --> 01:29:50,725
saw your fianc carve
those three letters on a tree.

1112
01:29:51,487 --> 01:29:54,160
He was wearing a red, spotted glove.

1113
01:29:54,327 --> 01:29:56,966
A comrade of Gunther's
told me the story.

1114
01:29:57,767 --> 01:30:00,964
When our plane
shot down your fianc,

1115
01:30:01,327 --> 01:30:03,283
they were sick to the stomach.

1116
01:30:03,687 --> 01:30:05,040
After that,

1117
01:30:05,207 --> 01:30:06,686
it was a nightmare.

1118
01:30:31,007 --> 01:30:34,716
God spared
that French soldier twice.

1119
01:30:37,607 --> 01:30:41,236
Then... your side attacked.

1120
01:30:42,207 --> 01:30:43,879
They killed my brother.

1121
01:30:45,767 --> 01:30:47,359
He was 23 years old.

1122
01:30:47,967 --> 01:30:50,686
l came to see his cross
at the cemetery.

1123
01:30:50,847 --> 01:30:51,962
l'm sorry.

1124
01:30:53,687 --> 01:30:56,759
Time heals all. You'll see.

1125
01:30:58,847 --> 01:31:01,486
l'll get back,
he'll be getting worried.

1126
01:31:11,527 --> 01:31:12,960
Seems l haven't killed it.

1127
01:31:13,727 --> 01:31:14,477
Pardon?

1128
01:31:15,127 --> 01:31:16,276
Hope!

1129
01:31:31,287 --> 01:31:32,481
What now?

1130
01:31:32,647 --> 01:31:35,559
Tina Lombardi.
She's going to the guillotine!

1131
01:31:35,727 --> 01:31:37,604
They call her the ''Officer Killer''.

1132
01:31:38,207 --> 01:31:40,721
She's killed Lavrouye and Thouvenel.

1133
01:31:40,887 --> 01:31:43,481
And planned to kill Marchal Ptain.

1134
01:31:50,327 --> 01:31:53,160
When l think you sat in a wheelchair
to soften me up!

1135
01:32:25,167 --> 01:32:26,600
l'll talk only to you,

1136
01:32:28,047 --> 01:32:30,003
because l know we're very similar.

1137
01:32:30,887 --> 01:32:32,798
We'll leave them alone.

1138
01:32:38,007 --> 01:32:39,884
What l did,
you could've done, too.

1139
01:32:40,807 --> 01:32:42,035
l don't think so.

1140
01:32:43,727 --> 01:32:45,046
l'd be too scared.

1141
01:32:45,567 --> 01:32:47,046
l'm not scared.

1142
01:32:48,247 --> 01:32:49,760
And l regret nothing.

1143
01:32:51,487 --> 01:32:52,715
Except my hair.

1144
01:32:54,247 --> 01:32:57,603
l'll be treated to a bowl-cut
before the execution.

1145
01:32:58,847 --> 01:33:02,157
l'll look like Joan of Arc
when l see my Angel!

1146
01:33:04,087 --> 01:33:06,282
Why did you want to kill Ptain?

1147
01:33:06,527 --> 01:33:09,360
Throwing mutilated soldiers
over the top was his idea.

1148
01:33:09,567 --> 01:33:11,398
Why not Poincar?

1149
01:33:11,927 --> 01:33:13,280
He refused them a pardon.

1150
01:33:14,607 --> 01:33:15,676
You don't know?

1151
01:33:17,727 --> 01:33:20,560
He did pardon them.
All five!

1152
01:33:21,087 --> 01:33:23,476
lt's just a leave.

1153
01:33:23,727 --> 01:33:26,764
Lavrouye kept the paper for himself.

1154
01:33:27,167 --> 01:33:29,044
Why did that dog Lavrouye do that?

1155
01:33:30,007 --> 01:33:33,363
Because dirty dogs play dirty.
That's all.

1156
01:34:05,447 --> 01:34:07,278
Trust me on this.

1157
01:34:07,447 --> 01:34:08,926
l took care of him!

1158
01:34:12,607 --> 01:34:15,360
You and l have been running
the same investigation.

1159
01:34:16,487 --> 01:34:18,045
Each in our own way.

1160
01:34:20,607 --> 01:34:22,802
Looking for survivors from Bingo,

1161
01:34:23,167 --> 01:34:26,603
l picked up a male nurse
who'd treated Angel and the others.

1162
01:34:27,087 --> 01:34:30,397
This guy, Phillipot,
was sure he'd seen one of them.

1163
01:34:31,007 --> 01:34:33,316
A big man, with a head wound.

1164
01:34:33,567 --> 01:34:36,400
He was a big man.
Head wound, German boots...

1165
01:34:36,567 --> 01:34:40,685
He wore German boots and
was carrying a thin-built soldier.

1166
01:34:40,847 --> 01:34:43,839
l think that's about right.
l'm even sure of it.

1167
01:34:44,447 --> 01:34:46,358
A big man, head wound...

1168
01:34:47,007 --> 01:34:49,726
His superior told him
to keep his mouth shut.

1169
01:34:51,927 --> 01:34:54,521
You can imagine
how overwhelmed with hope l was.

1170
01:34:56,487 --> 01:34:59,081
And then, l met the man
who shattered my dreams.

1171
01:35:00,647 --> 01:35:02,365
Chief Sergeant Favart.

1172
01:35:04,047 --> 01:35:08,245
He told me how that pig Thouvenel
had shot my Angel, just like that!

1173
01:35:08,847 --> 01:35:10,326
Like taking a leak.

1174
01:35:15,847 --> 01:35:17,121
l took care of him, too!

1175
01:35:20,127 --> 01:35:21,640
lt was an obsession.

1176
01:35:23,007 --> 01:35:25,396
Kill all those who hurt my man.

1177
01:35:30,287 --> 01:35:32,403
Your Angel left you this.

1178
01:35:52,407 --> 01:35:55,080
''Vengeance is pointless.
Try to be happy,

1179
01:35:55,247 --> 01:35:57,078
''and don't ruin your life for me.

1180
01:35:57,247 --> 01:35:58,999
''Your Angel from Hell.''

1181
01:36:04,887 --> 01:36:07,447
Departure for Paris,
Platform 2.

1182
01:36:07,727 --> 01:36:10,958
Gordes, the one who switched boots
with Bastoche...

1183
01:36:11,127 --> 01:36:12,321
was he big?

1184
01:36:12,487 --> 01:36:16,036
Biscuit? He was no athlete.
Just a guy like you or me.

1185
01:36:16,247 --> 01:36:18,317
And you have no news
of Desrochelles?

1186
01:36:18,487 --> 01:36:22,765
He didn't make friends easily.
He lived alone with his mother.

1187
01:36:23,007 --> 01:36:26,158
l must go. l'm boarding in an hour
for Venezuela.

1188
01:36:27,087 --> 01:36:28,520
Good luck, Clestin!

1189
01:36:28,687 --> 01:36:29,802
To you too!

1190
01:36:37,567 --> 01:36:39,876
When l think
you hid Poincar's pardon!

1191
01:36:41,207 --> 01:36:44,483
l didn't want to throw salt
on the wound.

1192
01:36:44,727 --> 01:36:46,240
l'd like one last favour.

1193
01:36:47,047 --> 01:36:49,402
l suppose it concerns Bingo-thingy?

1194
01:36:49,927 --> 01:36:51,246
Son of bookseller,
Desrochelles Paul,

1195
01:36:51,407 --> 01:36:52,886
born in Sarreguemines,

1196
01:36:53,047 --> 01:36:55,561
died in February, 1897...

1197
01:36:56,727 --> 01:36:58,206
That's it, Desrochelles Jean!

1198
01:36:58,367 --> 01:36:59,482
What?

1199
01:37:01,887 --> 01:37:03,115
ln Saintes.

1200
01:37:04,407 --> 01:37:05,476
ln the Charentes.

1201
01:37:09,527 --> 01:37:12,997
Tell me, Mr. Pire, Tina Lombardi...
You had an inkling

1202
01:37:13,167 --> 01:37:14,646
of what she was up to.

1203
01:37:14,847 --> 01:37:17,042
Luckily, your paths didn't cross.

1204
01:37:17,207 --> 01:37:19,767
He who pries, flies,
when danger lurks.

1205
01:37:19,927 --> 01:37:22,202
He who pries, pries,
but, from a distance.

1206
01:37:22,367 --> 01:37:24,597
l've a new lead for you.

1207
01:37:24,767 --> 01:37:28,123
Jean Desrochelles. Evacuated from
the Front on the 7th of January '1 7.

1208
01:37:28,287 --> 01:37:31,916
His only next of kin was his mother,
the widow Desrochelles.

1209
01:37:32,167 --> 01:37:35,523
She lives at 22 rue de l'Abbaye.
Saintes, in the Charentes.

1210
01:37:35,887 --> 01:37:37,286
All the work's been done!

1211
01:37:40,767 --> 01:37:41,995
You've tried to reach me?

1212
01:37:43,447 --> 01:37:46,359
My brother's comrade,
the one l told you about...

1213
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:50,679
He remembered something
that might interest you.

1214
01:37:51,127 --> 01:37:54,881
The two French soldiers
escorting him that morning,

1215
01:37:55,047 --> 01:37:57,959
wanted to go back through
no-man's-land.

1216
01:37:58,127 --> 01:38:00,243
They saw the prisoners' bodies.

1217
01:38:00,407 --> 01:38:02,762
One was in a kind of small cellar.

1218
01:38:02,927 --> 01:38:05,646
The French soldiers
seemed surprised.

1219
01:38:06,167 --> 01:38:09,318
l don't know if that can help you.

1220
01:38:10,967 --> 01:38:11,922
Thank you.

1221
01:38:16,367 --> 01:38:19,245
''Tell old Bernay
l want to settle up by March.

1222
01:38:19,407 --> 01:38:23,002
''His manure's too costly,
watch out for him.''

1223
01:38:24,407 --> 01:38:26,637
''His manure's too costly...''

1224
01:38:26,807 --> 01:38:29,082
There must be a code.

1225
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:44,805
Your Mr. Pry called!

1226
01:38:45,327 --> 01:38:47,363
He's run into a dead-end in Saintes.

1227
01:38:47,527 --> 01:38:48,562
l know!

1228
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:01,246
Hello! Go ahead.

1229
01:39:02,287 --> 01:39:04,323
Yes, Miss. l remember you.

1230
01:39:04,887 --> 01:39:08,516
Old Bernay? No, never heard of him.

1231
01:39:09,727 --> 01:39:11,638
Benoit Notre Dame
used the manure from his animals.

1232
01:39:11,807 --> 01:39:13,399
He never bought it!

1233
01:39:13,887 --> 01:39:15,366
Thank you, Father.

1234
01:39:17,207 --> 01:39:18,959
l must decode this letter.

1235
01:39:20,007 --> 01:39:21,725
l think we're getting hot.

1236
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:59,001
Will be - Bernay - March

1237
01:39:59,207 --> 01:40:00,526
Sell - Everything

1238
01:40:00,687 --> 01:40:01,836
Say - Nothing

1239
01:40:02,007 --> 01:40:04,157
Listen - No one

1240
01:40:04,767 --> 01:40:05,677
Benoit

1241
01:40:54,447 --> 01:40:57,166
Excuse me,
the ''End of the World'' farm?

1242
01:40:57,647 --> 01:40:59,842
The last house
at the end of the road.

1243
01:41:18,887 --> 01:41:20,320
And if he doesn't come?

1244
01:41:20,727 --> 01:41:22,126
He'll come, don't worry.

1245
01:41:22,287 --> 01:41:23,879
Come back in two hours.

1246
01:41:53,967 --> 01:41:55,195
Hello, Mathilde.

1247
01:41:55,367 --> 01:41:57,881
lt's dangerous
to want to bring back the dead.

1248
01:41:59,767 --> 01:42:01,997
When l saw your ad in the paper,

1249
01:42:02,407 --> 01:42:04,967
l knew, in time,
the gendarmes would come.

1250
01:42:06,767 --> 01:42:07,882
Don't worry.

1251
01:42:08,487 --> 01:42:10,682
l had the chance
to do away with you...

1252
01:42:10,847 --> 01:42:12,280
l let it go.

1253
01:42:37,447 --> 01:42:40,598
We knew you were a thief.
But a pyromaniac?

1254
01:42:40,847 --> 01:42:42,519
l couldn't kill you.

1255
01:42:42,727 --> 01:42:45,639
Now, even the rabbits and chickens,
my wife has to do it.

1256
01:42:45,807 --> 01:42:47,399
The war's taken it out of me.

1257
01:42:47,567 --> 01:42:49,364
You know what l want to hear.

1258
01:42:50,367 --> 01:42:51,561
ls he alive?

1259
01:42:55,327 --> 01:42:57,522
The last time l saw him,
he wasn't doing well.

1260
01:42:58,807 --> 01:43:00,365
But he's stronger than he looks.

1261
01:43:11,007 --> 01:43:12,281
Don't stay together.

1262
01:43:30,887 --> 01:43:34,084
When things calmed down,
l tried to get some sleep.

1263
01:43:34,407 --> 01:43:37,160
- Gaignard!
- You think we're at the whorehouse?

1264
01:43:37,327 --> 01:43:39,045
- Bouquet!
- What now?

1265
01:43:39,207 --> 01:43:40,606
Notre Dame?

1266
01:43:47,327 --> 01:43:49,602
Then the pimp tried to surrender.

1267
01:43:49,807 --> 01:43:52,241
And the welder
from Paris was killed.

1268
01:43:54,447 --> 01:43:56,677
Your fianc started carving
on the tree.

1269
01:43:57,207 --> 01:43:59,357
Then, the Jerries' Albatross arrived.

1270
01:44:12,727 --> 01:44:15,287
l came to,
when the ground started shaking.

1271
01:44:31,647 --> 01:44:35,162
l don't know what happened.
l just saw that trapdoor

1272
01:44:35,327 --> 01:44:36,726
the shell had half-opened.

1273
01:44:53,887 --> 01:44:55,081
For France!

1274
01:44:55,247 --> 01:44:56,521
Charge!

1275
01:45:07,807 --> 01:45:10,605
They entered no-man's-land.
At the second German line,

1276
01:45:11,207 --> 01:45:14,324
the machine guns got them.
A few hours later,

1277
01:45:14,687 --> 01:45:16,279
a voice woke me.

1278
01:45:17,687 --> 01:45:20,155
My God! Bastoche is dead!

1279
01:45:20,407 --> 01:45:21,635
We can't leave him here.

1280
01:45:21,807 --> 01:45:23,798
We'll come back.
He's not going anywhere.

1281
01:45:24,167 --> 01:45:25,680
Bastoche is dead.

1282
01:45:28,447 --> 01:45:30,438
Look, this one's still moving.

1283
01:45:30,607 --> 01:45:32,882
lt's the Cornflower.
He's a goner as well.

1284
01:45:49,487 --> 01:45:51,159
A shell had ripped the door off.

1285
01:45:51,607 --> 01:45:53,598
One of the guys arrived,
in bad shape.

1286
01:45:53,767 --> 01:45:55,280
Bastoche is dead!

1287
01:46:01,607 --> 01:46:03,359
We're all going to die.

1288
01:46:04,847 --> 01:46:05,996
l recognized Bastoche's friend.

1289
01:46:06,167 --> 01:46:08,727
The one who'd taken
his German boots.

1290
01:46:20,287 --> 01:46:22,642
After eating, l smoked his tobacco.

1291
01:46:23,327 --> 01:46:24,965
Then, l heard more voices.

1292
01:46:25,247 --> 01:46:26,646
Let's go look over there.

1293
01:46:27,767 --> 01:46:28,882
Look here!

1294
01:46:29,447 --> 01:46:30,675
Damn it!

1295
01:46:32,647 --> 01:46:34,080
lt's not the Cornflower.

1296
01:46:38,647 --> 01:46:40,285
What's he doing in there?

1297
01:46:41,807 --> 01:46:43,445
Where's the Dordogne farmer?

1298
01:48:05,287 --> 01:48:07,403
- l'm cold.
- Don't worry.

1299
01:48:27,087 --> 01:48:28,645
He was really messed up,

1300
01:48:29,327 --> 01:48:32,080
but your fianc wanted to live.
l saw it in his eyes.

1301
01:48:36,607 --> 01:48:39,405
l put him on my shoulders
and set off through the trench.

1302
01:48:43,727 --> 01:48:45,319
He was burning with fever.

1303
01:48:46,127 --> 01:48:48,038
l felt the heat on my back.

1304
01:48:49,567 --> 01:48:51,398
And he was delirious.

1305
01:48:52,927 --> 01:48:54,758
Spoke of a heart
beating in his hand.

1306
01:49:01,767 --> 01:49:02,961
Hey, Corporal!

1307
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:05,278
Only 500 yards to the hospital.

1308
01:49:05,447 --> 01:49:07,438
Want us to put your friend
on the stretcher?

1309
01:49:07,607 --> 01:49:08,676
No, thanks.

1310
01:49:08,847 --> 01:49:11,156
lf you see any officers from Bingo,

1311
01:49:11,327 --> 01:49:15,923
tell them Corporal Gordes has gone
to the hospital with Desrochelles.

1312
01:49:16,087 --> 01:49:17,486
Have it your way!

1313
01:49:18,127 --> 01:49:20,163
l arrived just before the explosion.

1314
01:49:20,327 --> 01:49:23,000
Headquarters had the good idea
of setting up hospital

1315
01:49:23,167 --> 01:49:26,045
in a hangar containing
a hydrogen-packed zeppelin.

1316
01:49:32,527 --> 01:49:35,360
The Cornflower
has just been evacuated.

1317
01:49:37,247 --> 01:49:38,475
Will he make it?

1318
01:49:39,207 --> 01:49:43,485
His hip wound isn't too bad. But
he has a severe case of pneumonia.

1319
01:49:44,967 --> 01:49:48,164
You're both registered
according to your tag numbers.

1320
01:49:48,487 --> 01:49:51,638
l don't want to know anything else.
But good luck anyway!

1321
01:50:39,367 --> 01:50:40,686
Block the pulley!

1322
01:51:14,567 --> 01:51:15,761
Please !

1323
01:51:45,807 --> 01:51:48,367
After that, l walked to Bernay.

1324
01:51:49,167 --> 01:51:51,727
l had no idea if my wife
had received my letter,

1325
01:51:51,887 --> 01:51:54,606
so each day l waited for her
at the bus-stop.

1326
01:52:01,367 --> 01:52:04,359
With the money from the sale,
we bought a farm here.

1327
01:52:05,087 --> 01:52:07,362
The most isolated one we could find.

1328
01:52:07,647 --> 01:52:10,081
They call it ''The End of the World''.

1329
01:52:17,967 --> 01:52:19,002
That's it.

1330
01:52:22,247 --> 01:52:23,316
Goodbye.

1331
01:52:27,327 --> 01:52:28,476
How strange.

1332
01:52:29,367 --> 01:52:31,801
You shot a hole
right through your lifeline.

1333
01:52:32,207 --> 01:52:33,606
Of course.

1334
01:52:33,927 --> 01:52:37,158
l died. At Bingo Crpuscule,
like your fianc.

1335
01:52:44,887 --> 01:52:47,959
lf ever you find
Jean Desrochelles alive somewhere,

1336
01:52:48,247 --> 01:52:49,646
let me know.

1337
01:52:50,087 --> 01:52:51,440
You know where to find me.

1338
01:53:03,367 --> 01:53:04,402
Make yourself at home!

1339
01:53:04,567 --> 01:53:06,398
At Christmas,
come down the chimney!

1340
01:53:06,567 --> 01:53:07,886
For Miss Mathilde.

1341
01:53:08,727 --> 01:53:10,558
l'll give it to her later.

1342
01:53:10,967 --> 01:53:12,400
lf l were you...

1343
01:53:12,847 --> 01:53:14,405
l would wake her up.

1344
01:53:19,647 --> 01:53:20,875
What is it?

1345
01:53:38,127 --> 01:53:39,355
''He's alive.

1346
01:53:41,087 --> 01:53:42,884
''Stay where you are, Mathilde.

1347
01:53:43,047 --> 01:53:44,958
''Just stay where you are.

1348
01:53:45,207 --> 01:53:46,560
''l'm on my way.

1349
01:53:46,887 --> 01:53:48,320
''Germain Pire.''

1350
01:53:55,967 --> 01:53:57,764
How silly l am!

1351
01:54:19,447 --> 01:54:22,439
Peerless on the prowl,
faster than a whippet!

1352
01:54:22,927 --> 01:54:26,237
He's well and truly alive,
but he's lost his memory!

1353
01:54:26,487 --> 01:54:30,924
Total amnesia. He even had to learn
to read and write again.

1354
01:54:31,207 --> 01:54:35,200
The psychiatrists treating him
since '1 7 aren't hopeful.

1355
01:54:35,567 --> 01:54:37,125
But who knows?

1356
01:54:37,287 --> 01:54:41,246
There are as many amnesias
as amnesiacs.

1357
01:54:41,687 --> 01:54:42,676
Where is he?

1358
01:54:42,887 --> 01:54:44,286
ln Milly-la-Fort.

1359
01:54:44,607 --> 01:54:48,680
Orphaned for the second time.
He's just lost his adopted mother.

1360
01:54:52,127 --> 01:54:54,925
Pierre-Marie, do you know Mr. Pire?

1361
01:54:55,487 --> 01:54:56,761
By reputation.

1362
01:54:56,927 --> 01:54:58,042
An honour.

1363
01:55:00,127 --> 01:55:02,402
Mathilde,
l'll believe it when l see it.

1364
01:55:02,847 --> 01:55:04,075
''With my own eyes!''

1365
01:55:04,487 --> 01:55:06,284
When Jean Desrochelles was born,

1366
01:55:06,607 --> 01:55:08,882
his mother was 40,
and had no other children.

1367
01:55:09,047 --> 01:55:10,719
When the gendarmes took him...

1368
01:55:10,967 --> 01:55:13,083
To replenish the troops in Ardennes.

1369
01:55:13,247 --> 01:55:14,726
She became depressed.

1370
01:55:15,007 --> 01:55:17,805
One day,
a comrade of her son visited her...

1371
01:55:18,207 --> 01:55:19,322
Chardolot!

1372
01:55:20,567 --> 01:55:22,444
Unfortunately, it was Jean.

1373
01:55:23,767 --> 01:55:27,123
A shell had got him. He'd already
been dead for a few hours.

1374
01:55:28,687 --> 01:55:30,166
l should also tell you...

1375
01:55:31,527 --> 01:55:34,644
Maybe the youngest prisoner
has taken Jean's identity...

1376
01:55:37,247 --> 01:55:38,805
exchanging tag numbers.

1377
01:55:42,567 --> 01:55:45,798
She went off her rocker
the day the hospital rang her,

1378
01:55:46,487 --> 01:55:49,285
asking to come to her son's bedside.

1379
01:55:51,527 --> 01:55:53,677
He's sleeping. l'll leave you.

1380
01:56:16,047 --> 01:56:17,480
Who are you?

1381
01:56:17,967 --> 01:56:19,844
Your mother, my darling.

1382
01:56:21,447 --> 01:56:23,085
l'm your mother.

1383
01:56:24,127 --> 01:56:25,879
l ran my own little investigation.

1384
01:56:26,247 --> 01:56:28,203
Mrs. Desrochelles died
two months ago.

1385
01:56:28,367 --> 01:56:31,120
Run over by a truck
after a fight with a shopkeeper.

1386
01:56:31,287 --> 01:56:32,800
And l'm not guessing!

1387
01:56:33,527 --> 01:56:35,802
- lt's in the report.
- We already knew that.

1388
01:56:41,687 --> 01:56:43,325
Don't get upset.

1389
01:56:43,847 --> 01:56:47,396
Mrs. Desrochelles didn't suffer,
she died straight away.

1390
01:56:47,567 --> 01:56:48,920
lt's not that.

1391
01:56:49,567 --> 01:56:51,285
l feel so guilty!

1392
01:56:52,727 --> 01:56:55,400
l didn't believe you,
my dear Mathilde!

1393
01:56:55,567 --> 01:56:57,285
l should have known!

1394
01:56:57,967 --> 01:56:59,559
l'm so sorry.

1395
01:57:06,567 --> 01:57:09,604
ln what she would refer to as
her ''Milly Expedition'',

1396
01:57:09,767 --> 01:57:13,203
the sun, the sky
and nature are with her.

1397
01:57:13,487 --> 01:57:16,843
As a true lady, she made
every effort to look her best.

1398
01:57:17,247 --> 01:57:19,044
Dressed in white for freshness,

1399
01:57:19,207 --> 01:57:22,722
lipstick for the occasion,
eyebrows shaped.

1400
01:57:22,887 --> 01:57:25,685
But none of that black
which lengthens the eyelashes.

1401
01:57:25,847 --> 01:57:28,042
She knows that tears
can make a mess of it.

1402
01:57:48,567 --> 01:57:50,398
He knows about your visit.

1403
01:57:50,567 --> 01:57:53,764
We said a young girl
he'd dearly loved was coming here.

1404
01:57:54,007 --> 01:57:56,567
He asked your name
and found it very beautiful.

1405
01:57:57,167 --> 01:57:59,681
He's in the garden.
He's waiting for you.

1406
02:00:02,887 --> 02:00:04,559
Does it hurt when you walk?

1407
02:00:12,647 --> 02:00:14,160
Want to see what l'm doing?

1408
02:00:26,847 --> 02:00:29,042
l'll show you later,
when it's finished.

1409
02:00:35,687 --> 02:00:37,086
But why are you crying?

1410
02:00:42,607 --> 02:00:45,519
Mathilde leans back
against her chair,

1411
02:00:46,367 --> 02:00:49,882
folds her hands in her lap
and looks at him.

1412
02:00:50,487 --> 02:00:54,526
ln the sweetness of the air,
in the light of the garden,

1413
02:00:55,127 --> 02:00:56,879
Mathilde looks at him.

1414
02:00:57,567 --> 02:00:59,205
She looks at him...

1415
02:00:59,607 --> 02:01:01,086
She looks at him...

1416
02:07:26,207 --> 02:07:28,880
