1
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Counselor! I've got him!

2
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,200
Down! You come down!

3
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,600
Down for good!

4
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,500
Forgive this early intrusion.

5
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,000
How are you?

6
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,600
I am a great admirer of yours.
Honored to meet you.

7
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
May I?

8
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,400
Can I use your typewriter, sir?

9
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,500
Your arm, please. Relax it.

10
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,300
- Your age?
- 43.

11
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,900
So, what are you cooking up?

12
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,300
Another film without hope?

13
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,400
- First time taking the cure?
- Yes.

14
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,600
Take a deep breath.

15
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,300
Come in.

16
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,300
- I'm sorry. I'll come back later.
- No, do come in.

17
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Breathe in.

18
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Deeper.

19
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,700
Good morning... May I smoke?

20
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,200
Cough.

21
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,500
Breathe in.

22
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,600
- You've already read it?
- Yes.

23
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,900
Breathe.

24
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,200
And... what do you think?

25
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,700
Well, I made some notes,
but we'll talk later.

26
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,600
Your system is a bit worn out.
You may get dressed now.

27
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,800
Nice looking girl. American, right?

28
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
You've got some fine merchandise there.

29
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,400
This treatment will do you good,
you'll see.

30
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,600
Nurse. 300 ml of holy water,

31
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,500
3 doses to be taken at 15 minute intervals,
on an empty stomach.

32
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,100
- Mud bath every other day...
- What time is it?

33
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,400
After the mud bath, ten minutes in the
mineral water as prescribed...

34
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,300
- I'll wait for you at the spring.
- Yes, thank you.

35
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,200
Sir!

36
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,400
Sir, your glass.

37
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,900
0ver here.

38
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,700
You want to talk about the film?
- Yes, of course.

39
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,400
Fine. Just tell me if you'd like
the producer to see my report.

40
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,000
Frankly, I wouldn't want to be
the one to cause you any trouble.

41
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,300
No, don't worry.
I'm the one who called you in.

42
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,900
0n first reading it's evident

43
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,800
that the film lacks a problematic,
or a philosophical premise...

44
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,300
Would you like to sit down?

45
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,200
...making the film
a series of gratuitous episodes,

46
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,000
perhaps amusing
for their ambiguous realism.

47
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,000
0ne wonders what the authors
are trying to say...

48
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,900
Are they trying to make us think?
To scare us?

49
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,500
From the start, the action reveals
a poverty of poetic inspiration.

50
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,000
Forgive me, but this might be
the definitive proof

51
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
that cinema is 50 years
behind all other arts.

52
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,100
The subject doesn't even have the merits

53
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,500
of an 'avant garde' film,
but it has all the shortcomings.

54
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,500
Here, my notes.
I doubt they will be helpful.

55
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,900
It's still a mystery that you'd think of me

56
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
for a collaboration that, frankly,
I don't think can work.

57
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,700
No, no. 0n the contrary.
You'll be most helpful.

58
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,600
You see, the film...
I really want to make this film.

59
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,800
I postponed the shoot
for two weeks because...

60
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,200
Mezzabotta! Pardon me.

61
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,500
Mezzabotta! Mario!
You're here too?

62
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,400
Guido!

63
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,400
What happened to you!

64
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,600
Hey, big Guido, how are you?

65
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,000
You've sprouted quite a few
white hairs, old Snaporaz!

66
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,600
Are you drinking that stuff?
It's bad for you.

67
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,000
They said my liver is, well...
And you, what's your treatment?

68
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,900
Just a second... Gloria!

69
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,700
- Your daughter. She's all grown up.
- No, she's not my daughter.

70
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,400
Cruel bees, sucking all the life
from these poor flowers.

71
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,100
- Darling, this is my friend...
- I'm sorry. My shoes...

72
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,400
Gloria. Gloria Morin.
- Nice to meet you.

73
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,500
Fine, thank you.

74
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,400
I know all about you.
Pupi always, always tells me.

75
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,900
We even had a big fight
when I was very critical of your last film.

76
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,900
That's not true. You liked it a lot.

77
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,800
Let's go for a drink. Let's go.

78
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,200
And you, are you here alone?
And your wife?

79
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,700
- Yes, I'm alone.
- Better that way...

80
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,200
Well, I mean, better in general...

81
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,700
You heard about Tina and me?
- Tina?

82
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,400
We're waiting for an annulment.

83
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,600
That's why we're here together.
We're engaged.

84
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,200
Congratulations.

85
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,500
Well, big Guido. What are you
working on? Something good?

86
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,000
Sure is the ideal place to do some thinking.

87
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,700
Daumier, the author, Miss...
Pardon me, what is your name?

88
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,200
- Gloria.
- Gloria Morin.

89
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,900
Nice to meet you.
I am a big admirer of yours.

90
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,400
I'm flattered.

91
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,600
Are you an actress?
Did I see your photo somewhere?

92
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,200
An actress. Yes, well...

93
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,000
I have ambitions in that area.
Actually enormous ambitions,

94
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,300
but that's all, for the moment.

95
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,700
She's got a degree in philosophy.

96
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,900
Allow me. Mario Mezzabotta.
- Nice to meet you.

97
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,900
I don't have a degree.
I'm doing my thesis. It's a bit different.

98
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,600
- And the subject?
- A difficult one.

99
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,900
The loneliness of modern man
in contemporary theater.

100
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,900
Interesting subject. Right, Professor?

101
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,900
And what is the meaning
of the capricious apparitions

102
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,700
of the girl of the spring?

103
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,900
An offer of purity?
Of warmth to the protagonist?

104
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,500
Of all your story's overabundant
symbols, this is the worst...

105
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,900
She didn't make it. Better that way.

106
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,900
- Yack! How are you?
- Not too bad.

107
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
- Did anybody recognize you?
- I don't think so.

108
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,700
You brought all that luggage?

109
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,200
It's just five suitcases.
Gowns occupy so much space.

110
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,900
I brought one... you'll see.
Did you get it all?

111
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Carla, it's quiet here at night.
There's nothing going on.

112
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,600
But it's a fashionable spa.
There must be some fashion shows,

113
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,900
some trendy clubs,
even at our hotel.

114
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,700
Have you been behaving?
- Yes, yes.

115
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,600
Actually... I couldn't get you a room
in my hotel,

116
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,600
and besides it's full of people who know me.

117
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,900
So, I found someplace else.
A perfect hotel...

118
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,300
Very pretty, you know...
- But why?

119
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,500
- And how's this guy?
- Sgulp? Great.

120
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,600
You look a little pale. How come?

121
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,700
See, the hotel is right here.

122
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,200
Signora, guests!

123
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,500
See. Like I told you. It's not...

124
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,900
but it's very quiet. If you're hungry,

125
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,100
I'll get them to bring a couple
of sandwiches.

126
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,100
It feels a little sad here.
- No, it's typical!

127
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Besides I'm hungry.
You had lunch, but I didn't.

128
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,100
Hello, Sir.

129
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,300
How's the solitaire coming along?

130
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,300
Everything's ready,
the room, the bathroom.

131
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,700
Rest assured.
Signora will feel at home.

132
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,400
Yes, thank you. You wouldn't
have anything ready for lunch?

133
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,000
- The restroom, please?
- It's over there.

134
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,200
I'll see to it personally.

135
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,800
Trains, such horrible things.
They leave your hands so black.

136
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,600
Are you happy I'm here?
- Yes.

137
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,100
- Really happy or a little happy?
- Very happy.

138
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,100
Hmm. Smack!

139
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,500
Mm, what a nice smell!

140
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,000
Guido, I thought this black velvet
was going to wrinkle.

141
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,000
- Really? Good, good.
- But no. Not a wrinkle.

142
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,900
Even after a three-hour trip.

143
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,100
You didn't even tell me you like it.
Do you like it?

144
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,000
Such a beautiful lady!

145
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,000
So refined.
That thing she has on her head...

146
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What is it? Ploosh?

147
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,800
- Plush, plush.
- Ah, ploosh.

148
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,600
I looked around for it like crazy.
I was quite desperate.

149
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,100
But you know me.
When Carla makes up her mind...

150
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,000
- Snarp!
- Sgulp!

151
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,100
I read a good Donald Duck last week...

152
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,800
There was a dinosaur...

153
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,300
- Here she is, my sweet-buns.
- Be good, a dinosaur...

154
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,500
Guido be good.
What do you want to do now?

155
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,400
Are you sure you've been behaving?
- Sure, why?

156
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,500
Anyway, now sweet-buns is hungry.
0h, my wedding ring.

157
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,800
Listen, Guido.
That little thing you promised me...

158
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,300
What little thing?

159
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,700
Now I bet she brings up
her husband again.

160
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,700
You don't think so?
You'll see, old Snaporaz.

161
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,000
My poor Luigi doesn't seem
happy at all.

162
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,600
You see, my husband is not
the confident type.

163
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
He gets depressed.

164
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,700
He's not stupid, you know.
He's actually very clever...

165
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,200
It's so hot here!

166
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,500
He knows all of Roman history by heart.

167
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,400
He just needs a push.

168
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,800
He's still working at the
fuel company, same salary.

169
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,800
Really?

170
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,700
Be good and put down my purse.
You'll break it.

171
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,000
I love that little purse.
He gave it to me.

172
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,200
Why don't you find him a job?

173
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,800
You know so many people.
You've promised it so many times.

174
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,200
I even had a dream about it.

175
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,200
I dreamed that
you did find him a job,

176
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,000
but he'd lost his mind
and killed us both.

177
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,300
- Who?
- You and me!

178
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,200
Know where we were?

179
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,400
In that little street, Via della Croce,
where I bought you

180
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,400
the same tie your wife did.
Do you remember?

181
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,800
And I never knew
if you were wearing hers or mine.

182
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,500
We were there on a cot,
in each other's arms, naked.

183
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,800
And he came in and he killed us
both with a broom!

184
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,800
- Draw the blinds more.
- Yes.

185
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,300
That's it. Now go into
the corridor for a minute,

186
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,000
then pretend you've come
to the wrong room

187
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,500
and found a stranger.

188
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,900
0h, that's good.
We've never done this one.

189
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,700
Hold it there.
Let me look at you.

190
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,800
No. No. Your make-up
needs to be more, more...

191
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,900
- More what?
- More like a slut!

192
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,000
Give me your eyeliner.

193
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,400
- Nice lampshade.
- Yes, yes.

194
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
- I'd like one for my place.
- Don't move.

195
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,200
What is this hotel called?

196
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,700
The Railway Hotel.

197
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,200
I want to write to my
husband so he'll send me

198
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,700
an express letter right away.
He writes such nice letters.

199
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,300
I'll let you read them.
- Fine, but keep still...

200
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,700
Make a slutty face.

201
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,400
Go out in the corridor.

202
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,900
- So, it's a part I have to play.
- Yes.

203
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,500
Who do you think I am?
0ne of your actresses?

204
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,800
You don't think
I could be one of them?

205
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,200
Not me. I wouldn't want
to lead that life.

206
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,200
I like staying home.

207
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,800
Go on, get out. I'm sleeping now.

208
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,500
Tell me. If I were really
to do something like this,

209
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,700
would you be jealous?

210
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,900
Why? Would you really?

211
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,000
Who knows?

212
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,300
- May I get you something?
- No, I just came out on a whim.

213
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,000
- Would you like me to run you a bath?
- No, I was just...

214
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,100
- A glass of water, perhaps?
- No, thank you.

215
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,400
What did she want?
What did she say?

216
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,400
The owner, she wanted
to give me a glass of water.

217
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,600
Come here. Come.

218
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,400
0pen up the sheet.

219
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,400
- Guido, do you love me a little?
- Yes, yes.

220
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,600
Is that you, Mama?

221
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,000
So many tears, my son,
so many tears.

222
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,900
Papa, wait! Don't go.

223
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,300
We talked so little.

224
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,900
Listen Papa,
I have so many questions.

225
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,500
I cannot answer them yet.

226
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,200
See the ceiling here? It's so low.

227
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,700
I would have liked it higher.
It's ugly, my son, ugly.

228
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,000
I would have liked it different.
Couldn't you take care of it?

229
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,100
You used to draw so well. I'd like...

230
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,200
0h, the Commendatore,
he shouldn't have bothered.

231
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,600
- Hello.
- Respects. He's got very little time.

232
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,400
Hi.

233
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,600
How is he doing, this son of mine?

234
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,300
Careful. Don't let him move you.

235
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,300
He isn't doing well? How come?

236
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,900
It is so hard, realizing that
one has made such huge mistakes.

237
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,800
But I...

238
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,500
Mother prepared you
a little something.

239
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,900
A little cheese and two peaches.

240
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
Don't worry about me.

241
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,200
Sure, this place gets a little lonely,

242
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,300
but your mother comes every day.

243
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,000
She keeps me company, you know.
And keeps everything in order.

244
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,200
A little decorum is always necessary.

245
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,300
That's how we were brought up.

246
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,600
And with your wife, Luisa... all fine?

247
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,100
Yes. Luisa...

248
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,500
You two together have been
my joy. Goodbye, son...

249
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,400
What is this place?
Do you like it here?

250
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,900
I haven't figured it out yet.

251
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,900
But it's going much better.

252
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,400
At first, you see, at first...

253
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,400
Guido! I do my best.
What more can I do?

254
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,100
Poor Guido, you must be tired.
Shall we go home?

255
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,600
I'm Luisa, your wife.
Don't you recognize me?

256
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,800
What are you thinking about?

257
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

258
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Good afternoon.

259
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,100
Guido! In a few days,
I'll get you an introduction

260
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,700
so you can get
all the advice you need.

261
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,400
Nice mystical figure. Right?

262
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,900
I brought you the three old men.

263
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,900
0ne is a Russian,
another is a retired general...

264
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,100
What old men?

265
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,800
The ones for the role of the Father.

266
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,000
Cover me, Cesarino...

267
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,200
Come here, buffoon.

268
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,400
How are you?
So nice to see you, Super Tarzan!

269
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,100
- I called you six times.
- Yes, yes I know.

270
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,300
- It's about Claudia's script.
- So?

271
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,000
I thought about mailing it to you.

272
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,100
In fact, I've already mailed it.
- Really?

273
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,200
You've still got your looks.
Why don't you go back to acting?

274
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,700
I was up all night with
an idea for the spaceship.

275
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,300
Why don't we make the upper story...

276
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,200
Conocchia, don't take my arm!
I hate it! And wear a jacket!

277
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,300
Now I need to wear a jacket
to talk to you...

278
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
How are you? How was your trip?

279
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,400
Good. It's been an hour...

280
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
What a blinding vision! Beautiful!

281
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,700
- Really?
- Yes.

282
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,000
You're always telling me
I'm 'bellissima'

283
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,300
but you never tell me about my part.

284
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,300
How was my screen test?
- Great, or you wouldn't be here.

285
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:32,600
They told me I have to look
motherly and eat a lot of pasta.

286
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,100
I should gain six pounds. Is this all?

287
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,300
See? You already know
more than I do.

288
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,900
You are the author.
You should be telling me something.

289
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,200
- What should this lady do?
- What?

290
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,500
Agostini!

291
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,400
I don't want to bother you.
The hotel is grand,

292
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,700
the whisky, excellent.
But I have three questions.

293
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,500
Yes, yes, later. What is it?
Ah, yes, yes. Pardon me.

294
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,500
Agostini, we should...

295
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,000
I just didn't feel like talking to that guy.

296
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,100
Claudia is getting offers
from all over the world.

297
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,300
I can't keep her waiting.
Give her something.

298
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,500
Do you have a script,
a few pages, an idea?

299
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,500
Does Claudia realize that this
might be a great part?

300
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,800
Perhaps the best she's ever
played? I'll explain...

301
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,300
I'm telling you as a friend,
you're gonna lose her.

302
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,100
- You want to see the old men or not?
- Are you crazy? We're ready...

303
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,900
What?
- The old men.

304
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,100
- Where are they?
- Here.

305
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,000
Signora Carla called. She doesn't
want to stay in that hotel.

306
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,500
It's ugly. She's right.
- What can I do? Bring her here?

307
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,100
I'll call the old men.

308
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,400
Sorry, I wanted to introduce you
to my little wife.

309
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,300
Thrilled.

310
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,800
She writes too. She's a columnist
for some ladies' magazines.

311
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,700
She's got a few questions for you.

312
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,200
My readers go crazy for romance.

313
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,600
Could you tell me something
about your love life?

314
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,100
Here they are.
Say hello to the Dottore.

315
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,600
Step down. You too, General.

316
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,300
- How old are you?
- 70.

317
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,100
- And you?
- 64.

318
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,500
- And you?
- 68.

319
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,100
They aren't old enough.

320
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,900
What? This one
has one foot in the grave.

321
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,200
Next time I'll get three corpses.
You asked for a pathetic type...

322
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,200
This one makes you wanna cry
the minute you see him.

323
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,000
Hello, Commendatore.

324
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,300
If you kneel, what do I do?

325
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,900
Get up or you'll hurt yourself.
How are you, little Guido?

326
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,300
Hello, Commendatore.

327
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,600
We took a helicopter.
This one screamed the whole way.

328
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,400
Where's the swimming pool?

329
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,400
We haven't even checked in. Shut up!

330
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,900
Has the treatment helped?
- Yes.

331
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,200
- Feeling better? Here.
- What is it?

332
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,400
Just a token.

333
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,300
- You're always giving me presents.
- It's just like mine.

334
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,600
It doesn't need winding.

335
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,600
A watch! A little watch, everyone!

336
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,800
- So, are your ideas any clearer now?
- Yes, I really think so.

337
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,300
We've got the Americans...

338
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,500
I've seen her passport.
She's 52 years old?

339
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,500
Ah, she's a little girl.

340
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,100
Good evening, signora.

341
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,700
And who are you, darling?

342
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,900
Mr. Director, another little question...

343
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:17,400
He wants to know the relationship
between Catholicism and Marxism.

344
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,800
Thank you, I got it.

345
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,500
You want to know about
my political affiliation.

346
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:26,000
As an honest man,
and all of you Italians are,

347
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,000
you should be able to answer me.

348
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:33,400
Is Italy an essentially Catholic country?

349
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,100
Yes, it is!

350
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,100
You shut up and eat your ice-cream.

351
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,400
It's the estimate for the spaceship.

352
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,400
I need to talk to you later,
face to face,

353
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,800
I'm at the end of my rope.
This is a madhouse!

354
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,200
Fine, we'll discuss it later.
What was that about your cholesterol?

355
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,900
...only one great writer.
The early Fitzgerald.

356
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,200
Then his writing became an orgy
of pragmatism or brutal realism.

357
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,900
What does Left or Right mean?

358
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,800
You're such an optimist
to believe that in a world

359
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,700
this confused and chaotic
there are people so lucid

360
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,000
as to belong exclusively
to the Left or the Right.

361
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,200
The Americans have this new
theory about cholesterol...

362
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,200
- Is your ice-cream good?
- Very good.

363
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,300
Could you say approximately
how many scenes she'll be in?

364
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,400
What?

365
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,600
- How many scenes?
- Five.

366
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,300
0nly five.

367
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,000
Maybe six, or even seven.

368
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,700
Good evening.

369
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,700
Hi, Guido.

370
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,200
The Ambassador's got his eye on signora.

371
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,700
So?

372
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,700
- I thought you'd want to know.
- Good, now I know.

373
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,600
- Do you want me to ask her to dance?
- Yes, ask her.

374
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,400
Dear friends there's only one truth...

375
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:24,700
But I am so anxious to know,
to understand my character.

376
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,400
I need to coexist with my character
for a while before shooting...

377
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,600
The lady says she needs
to know her character.

378
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,700
I need to get inside her skin,
her ideas, or I'll fail.

379
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,600
Hasn't the Maestro explained
the part yet?

380
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,300
- No.
- I am sorry, dear lady.

381
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:48,000
I don't have such information.
I'm only the producer.

382
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:52,200
Guido, isn't it true that I know nothing?
- Right. Not a thing.

383
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,200
And now three days of rest.

384
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:10,300
They look like glass.
The first cherries of spring.

385
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,800
Thanks. And for Guido?

386
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,800
Mario Mezzabotta,
all 200 pounds of him.

387
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,700
Shall we take a little walk?

388
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:39,400
I know... Naturally,
you think I've lost it.

389
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,300
Yes.

390
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,600
- I'm 30 years her senior. So what?
- It's all right.

391
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,000
I may be the fool, the old imbecile,
the one who foots the bill. So what?

392
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:55,500
Could you create something important,
beautiful and real on a commission?

393
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,600
For instance, if the Pope asked you?

394
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,600
Yes, yes. I'll think about it.
Excuse me.

395
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,100
Listen, I'm not deluding myself.

396
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,600
Maybe she's only with me
for the money.

397
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,100
Actually, that's certainly it.

398
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,900
But I've never felt closer
to anybody in my life.

399
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,200
Just look at her.
She's pretty, charming, intelligent.

400
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,600
She has it all. 0nly for the money?

401
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,300
But there are so many rich young men
around these days, loads of them.

402
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,600
It's clear. She cares for you.

403
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,300
Right. And she hasn't tried
to pressure me.

404
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,800
I made up my mind rationally.

405
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,400
The poor thing has never
even mentioned my wife,

406
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,800
my family, never a reproach.

407
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,400
How did you meet her?

408
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,300
In London. She was in school
with my daughter.

409
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,100
How many years have you
been married?

410
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,000
Many. 31.

411
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,700
And your wife...

412
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,200
My wife took it really badly.
She hates her.

413
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,300
While Gloria, poor thing,
is fond of her.

414
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,900
So spell it out. I am a fool!

415
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,700
There must be a shooting schedule.
Dates.

416
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,000
0therwise we're off to Germany.
We have other offers.

417
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,100
Will you be leaving me
in the dark 'til the end?

418
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,600
You look like a little snail.

419
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,400
- What is a little snail?
- Une petite escargot.

420
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,000
Can you hear the voice
of the springs?

421
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,600
The Romans used to call it
'Happy Waters. '

422
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,700
Maya, let's entertain these bores.

423
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,400
May I?

424
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,800
Are you ready, Maya?
What am I holding?

425
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,900
A velvet purse.

426
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,700
- And inside?
- A white handkerchief.

427
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,600
A red one.

428
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,400
- No drugs, I hope.
- No, it's aspirin.

429
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,100
- A purse.
- Is there any money in it?

430
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,400
2,725 lire.

431
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,900
And this lady here.
What is she thinking?

432
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,000
No dirty thoughts, I hope.

433
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,600
Just think about something.

434
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,800
About what?

435
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,400
Whatever you like.
Are you thinking?

436
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,600
Yes.

437
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,100
I'd like to live another 100 years.

438
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,800
Best of luck!

439
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,800
And what is in this pretty
lady's head?

440
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,200
Let me be.

441
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,500
May I think about someone?

442
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,300
Yes. Go ahead, Lady!

443
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,100
Forget about it. I'm ashamed.

444
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,800
What about?

445
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,600
Can I really think of a person?

446
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,300
I'd be afraid to have my thoughts read.

447
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
Don't you worry darling,
no risk there.

448
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,200
Would you like to leave? It's cold.

449
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,500
A little kiss and a big slap.
Is that right?

450
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,500
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're thinking, 'What a trickster. '

451
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,200
Well, sorry to disappoint you,
but there's no trick.

452
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,400
And it isn't just a coincidence.

453
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,900
It's an exceptional example
of magnetic fields and telepathy.

454
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,300
I transmit your thoughts to Mlle. Maya.

455
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,800
You! Do you believe
you can hide your thoughts?

456
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,000
Please, leave her alone.
Don't insist.

457
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,100
Thoughts are sacred.

458
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,900
See, it's all a game.

459
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,200
Maya, are you ready?

460
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,700
Just a moment, could we know
what you gentlemen are thinking?

461
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,100
You for instance.

462
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,500
What are you thinking?

463
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
What else? My director.
My cross and my delight.

464
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

465
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,800
It has been quite a while... years!

466
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,900
Unfortunately yes, my dear.

467
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,300
Just a moment. You're famous now.

468
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:18,400
Cut it out.
Just tell me what's your trick?

469
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,100
Well, it's partly a trick,
but part of it is real.

470
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,000
I don't know how, but it happens.
- Can you transmit anything?

471
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,600
Anything. Except for her to get lost.

472
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,200
- Do you want to try?
- Yes. Wait.

473
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,500
I bet now, with you, it won't work.

474
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,800
I don't understand. I can't repeat...

475
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,900
Asa... nisi... masa?
Is this right?

476
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,200
- Right?
- Yes.

477
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,600
But what does it mean?

478
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,100
Guido, come here!
Where are you?

479
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,900
Don't be spoiled! What a wonder!

480
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,300
I don't want to take a bath,
I don't want to...

481
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,800
Come here... let me catch you?

482
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,300
I know what that rascal wants.

483
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,000
He wants to be carried
by his sweetheart,

484
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,600
doesn't he, the strapping lad.

485
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,700
Come here. Come here.

486
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,100
He never wants to take
the wine bath, the naughty boy.

487
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,800
Don't you know that if you do
you'll grow into a strong man?

488
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,900
Guido is scared! Guido is scared!

489
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,900
The Devil and damnation!

490
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,600
Granny, granny!

491
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,400
The wood is all wet this year.

492
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,300
This prowling cat is just
like your grandfather.

493
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,800
Always on the prowl
and only comes in for food.

494
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,200
Shame on you! Go to bed.

495
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,600
Last time I slammed the door
in his face

496
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,800
and left him outside for two days.

497
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I could have married again
and found a handsome man,

498
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,100
rest assured, better
than your grandfather.

499
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,600
What an idiot I am!

500
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,400
I thought that if I took another
husband, my first husband,

501
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,400
whether in heaven or hell,
wouldn't have waited.

502
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,400
Be quiet! Go to bed, children!

503
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,900
Nanny, Claudio wet himself!

504
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,100
What are you doing?
Go to sleep. You too, sleep.

505
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,800
Little Guido, get under the covers.
It's cold. Be still.

506
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,700
Did you say your prayers?

507
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,700
Aren't you a beautiful sticky bun?
The most beautiful!

508
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,600
Give me a kiss, too.

509
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,600
Who do you love best? Me?
Is that right?

510
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,500
You can't fool me.

511
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,700
I'm going to give you a spanking.

512
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:05,200
I can tell when you're pretending.

513
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,100
Sleep tight, little creatures.

514
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,400
Close your eyes.

515
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,800
Guido, don't close your
eyes tonight!

516
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,300
It's the night the portrait's eyes move.
You're not scared, are you?

517
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,800
You must be quiet!

518
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,500
Uncle Agostino will look into
the corner and find the treasure!

519
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,600
Don't be afraid, Guido!
We'll be rich!

520
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:46,700
Do you remember the spell?
Asa Nisi Masa... Asa Nisi Masa... sh!

521
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,700
Sir, you got two or three calls from Rome.
Your wife, I think.

522
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,100
Fine. Get me the line.

523
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,800
- Gino, get the gentleman the line.
- All right.

524
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,800
- This is for you. Good night, sir.
- Good night.

525
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,600
Marcella, that call from Rome, quickly.

526
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,400
No, I'm not offended.

527
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,100
There's only one thing
that offends me.

528
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:03,100
You know me. No.

529
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,100
I forgive him everything.

530
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,500
Let's have a little chat.

531
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,400
Sit beside me for a moment.

532
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,000
No, I'm going to bed.
I'm very tired and waiting for a call.

533
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,500
Would you like some?

534
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,300
No, thank you.
I have such a headache.

535
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,700
Give me your hands.

536
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,300
No, sit down.

537
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,900
I have a healing fluid
in my left hand.

538
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,500
I put it on my belly when it aches.

539
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,600
Take off your hat.

540
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,700
Is it any better?

541
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,800
Yes, maybe.

542
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,200
Why do you look at me that way?

543
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,500
0h, don't say I'm beautiful.
You make it sound insulting.

544
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,300
What's with you?

545
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,300
I don't know.

546
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:20,100
I feel I made all the wrong
decisions in my life and in my work.

547
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,500
Tell me, why do you enjoy
torturing me?

548
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,100
Torturing you?

549
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,600
Talk to me as you would
to an old friend.

550
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,100
I need to feel close to my director.

551
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,300
Did you see my last movie,
the one shot in Belgrade?

552
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,000
My character was a woman
marked by the injuries of time,

553
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,000
yet still desirable...

554
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,600
- Play "Mystification".
- I don't know it.

555
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,500
But yes...

556
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,400
What a character... this woman...

557
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,500
But...

558
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,400
In whom people find protection
and love.

559
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,300
I am this character.
I am like her in life and love.

560
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,100
That's why I'm so lonely.

561
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,900
And I have always forgiven
everything in the man...

562
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,600
the men, I love.

563
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,300
- Sir, Rome on the line.
- Thank you.

564
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,700
I am very sensual. Wicked, too!

565
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,800
Yes, yes, you're very close.
I'll be right back.

566
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,700
Rome on the line. You may speak.

567
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,800
Hello, yes!

568
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,300
- Do you want Luisa?
- Yes.

569
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,500
Feeling guilty, you beast?
This is Rossella.

570
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,400
Hi, Rossella. How are you?
Luisa was looking for me.

571
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:48,500
Where were you this time?
Your rest cure? What an excuse...

572
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,400
Here comes Luisa.

573
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,900
Guido, I called you twice.
Where were you?

574
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,700
I know. I'm sorry.

575
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,700
I was up in the production office.
We're working.

576
00:46:58,900 --> 00:46:59,900
How are you?

577
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,600
Not bad... And the treatment?

578
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,800
Is it helping?

579
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:08,700
Perhaps. But, you know,
I can't really rest.

580
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,400
And you? What are you doing?
Having fun?

581
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,200
The usual. I'm with Rossella, Tilde, Enrico.
They were about to leave.

582
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,700
But are you having a good time?
Did you meet anybody?

583
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,500
Hardly. It's a terrible bore.

584
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,500
But for my work, it's better this way.

585
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,700
- Good night, Guido.
- 'Night.

586
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,500
You've met no one you know?
Are you always alone?

587
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,900
0f course.

588
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,600
Really?

589
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,400
Luisa, why don't you come visit?

590
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,600
Just a short stay.
It's easy to get here.

591
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,900
When are you going
to start shooting, you bore?

592
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,000
I don't know.
Let me talk to Luisa, please.

593
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,700
So, should I come?
Do you want me to?

594
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,300
If you'd like to.

595
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,500
You could even bring a friend.

596
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,800
But would it make you happy?

597
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,200
0f course, or I wouldn't ask you.

598
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,500
- Sir, are you staying on?
- No.

599
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,300
When should I come?

600
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,600
Whenever it's good for you.

601
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,100
Careful, I'll come.

602
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,100
Darling, I wouldn't have asked.

603
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,800
I'd love it...
So long, and good night.

604
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,400
Bye, Mr. Alienated. Good night.

605
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,200
Night, Guido.

606
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,600
Monsieur Guido, my agent thought...

607
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,500
Just a second, madam. I am going
to step into the office so...

608
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,000
- Shit!
- It's in my best interest.

609
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,200
Tomorrow morning
we'll discuss everything. All right?

610
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,000
Beams for the central structure:
10,000.

611
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,200
Planks for steps: 260.

612
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,700
'Evening.

613
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,700
Do you need something?

614
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,300
No, thanks.
Go on with your work.

615
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,000
What a well-behaved
production team.

616
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,100
Hi.

617
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,300
0h, hi Eleonora.

618
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,600
2,350. Corrugated iron.

619
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,300
Listen, Dottore, since you're here.

620
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,600
I called the pensione about
the German, but she's gone.

621
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,600
- You must find her.
- She's in Paris with a circus.

622
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,800
Really?

623
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,800
What should I do?

624
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,200
What an honor, Dottore.

625
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,100
You've caught me
with my pants down!

626
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,600
Listen Guido.
About the farm... there's that...

627
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,700
Ah, here. Where's this place?

628
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,500
It doesn't even have a note
about the address, nothing!

629
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,500
It's in the Prince's estate.

630
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,500
- Who's in here?
- My little nieces.

631
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,900
Eva and Dina.

632
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,600
'Evening.

633
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,800
C'mon. Let him take a look at you.

634
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,400
Perhaps he'll give you
a little part.

635
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,700
- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

636
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,900
Where are you from?

637
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,300
- Trieste.
- Hurray for Italy!

638
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,100
You've got a nice set up here,
don't you?

639
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,300
Tell him about my cousin.

640
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,600
Guido. This one's cousin
is six feet tall.

641
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,800
You should see her.
She might be good for the movie.

642
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,400
This one... you she-devil...

643
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,300
It's true. She's tall like me
standing on the bed.

644
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,800
See?

645
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,700
She's twice been voted
Miss Nylon Stockings.

646
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,700
Is Guido in there? I'm coming in.

647
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,600
Sleep, Conocchia, sleep.
I'll see you tomorrow.

648
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,100
May I ask you a question?

649
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,500
Go ahead.

650
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:22,700
My friend here says...
you can't make a love story.

651
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,400
- Shut up!
- She's right.

652
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,400
Should I wake you up
in the morning, Guido?

653
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,500
No, thanks.

654
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,600
0ur commander will never
catch us unprepared.

655
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,600
This production crew never sleeps!

656
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,600
Such a splitting headache.
What did I eat?

657
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,600
They're always horsing around,
but they're good guys.

658
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,000
Do you need anything, Guido?
Is it a new idea?

659
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:47,500
Do you have something to tell me?

660
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,400
No, thank you, no.

661
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,200
Go back to bed.
I don't need anything.

662
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,900
- Anything at all.
- No, thank you. Good night.

663
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,200
Good night my ass!

664
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:00,000
Who can sleep here?
How can I get any sleep?

665
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,100
Conocchia, calm down.

666
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,500
Allow me. I have been in this
business for 30 years,

667
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,500
I've worked on movies
you couldn't begin to imagine

668
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,400
and I have never been afraid
of anything!

669
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,400
What are you shouting for,
you crazy old man!

670
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,700
There, you've said it now. 0ld.

671
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,700
Finally you've spat it out.
Conocchia is old.

672
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,400
What do you want?
Get back inside.

673
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,900
You always keep me in the dark.
I never know what to do.

674
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,300
When to talk or when to shut up.
I don't want to bother you.

675
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,400
I don't want to know
what this movie is about.

676
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,500
- You want to keep it a secret? Go ahead.
- Please, go back to bed.

677
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,300
But if I'm to help you out,
as I've always done,

678
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,400
and you were so happy then,
you must tell me something!

679
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,700
Tell me: get rid
of the French woman...

680
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,800
this is how I want the spaceship...
tell me: go hang yourself,

681
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,100
but do tell me something.

682
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,300
You've changed so much,
Guido my friend.

683
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,200
What are you doing now?
Crying? Aren't you ashamed?

684
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,900
I'll be leaving tomorrow.
I'm quitting.

685
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,300
I don't want to be in your way.
You need some young blood.

686
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:10,700
Just be careful. You're not
the man you used to be, either.

687
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,000
A crisis of inspiration?

688
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,900
And what if it weren't a
passing one, my dear?

689
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,700
What if it's the final collapse
of a filthy liar

690
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,500
with no flair or talent? Sgulp!

691
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:19,200
Let's say you are purity itself.

692
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,100
But what the hell does it mean
to be really honest?

693
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,400
Didn't you hear
what the Falcaccio said?

694
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:30,800
"It's time to set all the symbols aside,
the echoing of purity, innocence, escape."

695
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,800
What is it you want then?

696
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,500
Yes, this could be it.

697
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,300
There's a museum in the town,
and you, the guard's daughter,

698
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,100
grew up surrounded by images
of ancient beauty...

699
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,700
You're right.

700
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,300
I've come to stay forever.

701
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:02,000
I want to create order,
I want to cleanse...

702
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,800
I want to create order,
I want to cleanse...

703
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:18,700
Hello?

704
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,600
They're asking for you
from the Railway Hotel.

705
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,100
Fine. I'll take it.

706
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,700
Hello? Who's that? Hello?

707
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,700
Guido, I feel dreadful.
The mineral water made me sick.

708
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,800
I have a temperature. Come.
Come here, immediately.

709
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,900
At this time of night?
I can't. I'll come tomorrow.

710
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,200
Come.

711
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,500
The poor thing, if you only knew
how she was asking for you.

712
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,700
Here's the ice.

713
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:49,000
- She's melting. She's got at least 104.
- Yes, fine. Just go now.

714
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,900
- Should I bring the peas?
- What peas?

715
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,600
When she was delirious
she asked for peas. It's a good sign.

716
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,400
No, just forget about it.

717
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,400
- If you need anything, let us know.
- Yes, thanks.

718
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:12,700
Carla, is this the first time you've run
such a high fever so suddenly?

719
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,800
No. It shoots up over nothing.

720
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,600
Then it goes away.
My husband is used to it.

721
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,900
It doesn't scare him

722
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,900
No, don't get up.
Stay under the covers.

723
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,700
- I'm so hot. I'm thirsty.
- Wait, I'll give it to you. Here.

724
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,200
Drink slowly or you'll get
all bloated!

725
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,300
- Is it day or night?
- What are you talking about?

726
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,900
It's four o'clock in the afternoon.

727
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,100
Listen, now we'll wait for the
doctor and see what he has to say.

728
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:52,200
It wouldn't be a bad idea to send
your husband a telegram.

729
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,900
We can't take full responsibility for this.
Yes, he ought to know.

730
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,700
No, I don't want it to be over.
If he comes, he'll take me away.

731
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,900
And I have bought
so many nice little dresses.

732
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,800
Why did you gorge on
all that water?

733
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,800
That's for sick people.
Are you sick?

734
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,800
You're always ready when
there's something to gorge on.

735
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,500
What else should I do?
You're always leaving me here alone.

736
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,200
I drafted my will two years ago.

737
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:25,800
Anyway, it's not like you die sooner
just because you make a will.

738
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:31,100
You see, I have a brother
and a sister too,

739
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,600
but I'd like the apartment
to go to my husband.

740
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,900
It's mine, but how would
the poor thing manage with out it...

741
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
even if he does get remarried?

742
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,200
Ah, these sheets!

743
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:52,800
Listen, tell me the truth,
the truth, you hear?

744
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,900
Why do you stay with me?

745
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,500
What can I tell the Cardinal tomorrow?

746
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:05,900
Yes, I did read the little synopsis
your producer sent us.

747
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,900
It's very interesting.
From a factual point of view though,

748
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,500
the meeting between
the protagonist

749
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,100
and a prince of the church could
not happen during a mud treatment

750
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,700
as you describe it.
I'm sorry but it's absolutely not feasible.

751
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,200
A high prelate has his
own private room.

752
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,100
True, but I was looking for
an unconventional setting.

753
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,300
What do you mean?

754
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,100
The protagonist received
a Catholic upbringing and...

755
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,400
- Good morning.
- Monsignor, this is Guido Anselmi.

756
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,100
Nice to meet you.
You must be the director.

757
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,200
Yes.

758
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,200
Is the subject of this film
a religious one?

759
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,000
Well, yes, in a manner of speaking.

760
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:41,900
As I was saying, the protagonist
had a Catholic upbringing,

761
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,800
like all of us, for that matter.
So, he has certain complexes,

762
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,800
certain needs he can no
longer repress.

763
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,200
And a prince of the church appears to him
like the depositary of a truth

764
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:53,700
that he can no longer accept
although it still fascinates him.

765
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:57,600
So, he seeks contact, some help,
perhaps a flash of understanding.

766
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,500
Saul in Damascus, right?

767
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,500
Don't we all harbor such hopes?

768
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,300
I do realize the idea might sound a
bit superficial, gothic if you want...

769
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,200
No, no, that's not it.

770
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:10,300
I don't believe cinema
lends itself well to certain topics.

771
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:14,800
You mix sacred
and profane love too casually.

772
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,500
Isn't that so?
- Maybe.

773
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,800
Yours is a great responsibility.

774
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:22,000
You can either corrupt
or educate thousands of souls.

775
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,400
His Eminence
will listen to you all the same.

776
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:27,200
You can ask him some questions.

777
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,900
Allow me to introduce you
to the director.

778
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,100
Please, do sit down.

779
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:43,100
Please pardon the intrusion,
Your Eminence. I wouldn't presume,

780
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,300
But my producer is restless,
perhaps he's right,

781
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,100
and he insisted that I...

782
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,100
- Are you married?
- Yes.

783
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,100
- Any children?
- Yes. I mean, no.

784
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,900
- How old are you?
- 43.

785
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,200
- Do you hear this singing bird?
- Pardon?

786
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,300
- Do you know what it's called?
- No.

787
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,000
It's called Diomedeo.

788
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:15,100
The legend has it that
when Diomedes died,

789
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:19,100
all these little birds gathered
and accompanied him to his grave

790
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:22,400
singing a funeral lamentation.

791
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,000
Hear? It sounds like wailing.

792
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:07,300
Guido, Guido let's go see
the Saraghina.

793
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,700
Coming.

794
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,400
Saraghina, dance the Rumba.

795
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,400
Here.

796
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:43,100
Shame on you, shame on you...

797
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,600
It's a mortal sin, it's a mortal sin...

798
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,500
I don't believe it, it can't be true...

799
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:52,900
Look at your mother, look at her!

800
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,600
- Mother.
- Stop there.

801
01:04:54,800 --> 01:05:02,300
0h God, I'm so ashamed,
so ashamed and hurt!

802
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,200
But above all, during his whole life
and in any place where he lived,

803
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:47,200
the pious Luigi most abhorred
any talk or dealing with women,

804
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,100
whose presence he avoided
in such a way that whoever

805
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:54,400
saw him thought he had a natural
dislike of them...

806
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,600
Get down!

807
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,500
Don't you know that Saraghina
is the devil?

808
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,500
No, I didn't. I really did not.

809
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,900
So, what does it mean?

810
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,200
It's a character inspired by
your childhood memories.

811
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:49,300
No connection with a real
critical conscience.

812
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,500
No, if you really want to make
a polemical piece

813
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:58,500
about the Italian Catholic
consciousness, you would need

814
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:03,600
a much higher degree of culture

815
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,800
as well as inexorable logic and clarity.

816
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:15,100
Forgive me, but...
your naivet is a serious failing.

817
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,800
Your little memories,
bathed in nostalgia,

818
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,900
your inoffensive and fundamentally
sentimental evocations

819
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,500
are all the expressions
of an accomplice...

820
01:08:23,869 --> 01:08:26,769
"How?" said the parish priest,
"With a communist?"

821
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:28,869
See? He didn't say: 'a man'.

822
01:08:29,169 --> 01:08:31,169
Catholic conscience?

823
01:08:32,669 --> 01:08:37,769
Just think what Suetonious was
at the time of the Caesars!

824
01:08:38,269 --> 01:08:44,469
No, your intention was to denounce,
but you end up

825
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:47,169
supporting it like an accomplice.

826
01:08:47,469 --> 01:08:50,569
See? What confusion...
what ambiguity!

827
01:08:57,969 --> 01:09:01,869
Dear Doctor, I'm very angry with you!

828
01:09:02,469 --> 01:09:03,869
But you don't need me anymore.

829
01:09:03,969 --> 01:09:05,769
That isn't true, absolutely not true.

830
01:09:05,869 --> 01:09:09,169
127: showers and mud treatments.

831
01:09:09,269 --> 01:09:11,869
129: massages.

832
01:09:12,869 --> 01:09:15,669
131: inhalations.

833
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:34,169
Hello, Commendatore.

834
01:09:36,169 --> 01:09:39,369
You know, I've figured out
what you're trying to talk about...

835
01:09:39,469 --> 01:09:43,969
Man's inner confusion.
But you've got to be clearer.

836
01:09:44,069 --> 01:09:44,369
You have to make yourself understood.
0therwise what's the use of it?
