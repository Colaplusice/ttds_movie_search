1
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,834
Teacher...

2
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,269
I see your talents have gone
beyond the mere physical level.

3
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,470
Your skills are now at the point
of spiritual insight.

4
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,153
I have several questions:

5
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,629
What is the highest technique
you hope to achieve?

6
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,915
- To have no technique.
- Very good.

7
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,829
What are your thoughts
when facing an opponent?

8
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,672
There is no opponent.

9
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,233
And why is that?

10
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,834
Because the word "l" does not exist.

11
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,953
So, continue.

12
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,551
A good fight should be...

13
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,038
...like a small play, but played seriously.

14
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,190
A good martial artist does not
become tense, but ready.

15
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,035
Not thinking, yet not dreaming.

16
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,270
Ready for whatever may come.

17
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,360
When the opponent expands, I contract.

18
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,830
When he contracts, I expand.

19
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,031
When there is an opportunity...

20
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,914
...I do not hit.

21
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,911
It hits all by itself.

22
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,711
Now, you must remember...

23
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,238
...the enemy has only images
and illusions...

24
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,233
...behind which he hides his true motives.

25
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,752
Destroy the image,
and you will break the enemy.

26
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,670
The hit that you refer to...

27
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,597
...is a powerful weapon...

28
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,748
...easily misused by the martial artist
who deserts his vows.

29
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,752
For centuries now...

30
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,038
...the code of the Shaolin Temple
has been preserved.

31
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,594
Remember...

32
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,598
...the honor of our brotherhood
has been held true.

33
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,479
Tell me now the Shaolin Commandment
Number 13.

34
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,670
"A martial artist has
to take responsibility for himself...

35
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,752
"...and to accept the consequences
of his own doing."

36
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,870
I'm ashamed to tell you now.

37
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,673
Among all the Shaolin men I have taught...

38
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,795
...there is one who has turned
the ways of knowledge and strength...

39
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,836
...to his own base ends.

40
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,034
He has perverted all we held sacred.

41
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,593
His name is Han.

42
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,629
In defiance of all our beliefs...

43
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,673
...he has brought disgrace
to the Shaolin Temple.

44
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,477
So, it is now for you to reclaim
our lost honor.

45
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,072
Yes, I understand.

46
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,199
There is a man here. You will go to him.

47
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,519
Hello, Mr. Lee. My name is Braithwaite.

48
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,591
Hello, Mr. Braithwaite.

49
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,516
I've come to speak to you
about a matter of great importance.

50
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,191
- Have some tea?
- Yes, indeed.

51
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,873
This is very pleasant.

52
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,516
I've come to speak to you
about a tournament of martial arts.

53
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,110
A tournament to which
you've already received an invitation.

54
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,237
Specifically, a tournament organized
by Mr. Han.

55
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,399
Han's tournament.

56
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,799
I know, I know...

57
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,398
...but we'd like you to attend
that particular tournament, Mr. Lee.

58
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,513
"We," Mr. Braithwaite?

59
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,759
It's Lahn's time.

60
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,079
Yes, of course.

61
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,109
Kick me.

62
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,475
Kick me.

63
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,148
What was that?

64
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,468
An exhibition?

65
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,596
We need emotional content.

66
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,554
Try again.

67
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,790
I said, "emotional content"...

68
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,634
...not anger!

69
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,150
Now try again with meaning!

70
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,754
That's it!

71
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,831
How did it feel to you?

72
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,439
Let me think.

73
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,158
Don't think! Feel!

74
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,752
It is like a finger pointing a way
to the moon.

75
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,156
Don't concentrate on the finger
or you will miss...

76
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,870
...all that heavenly glory.

77
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,199
Do you understand?

78
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,995
Never take your eyes off your opponent.

79
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,553
Even when you bow.

80
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,069
That's it.

81
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,909
There!

82
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,713
That's Han. That's the only film
we have on him.

83
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,635
We know that he was a member
of your temple. A Shaolin monk...

84
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,318
...now a renegade.

85
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,078
That's Oharra behind him.
Personal bodyguard.

86
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,830
Tough, ruthless, as you might expect,
being Han's bodyguard.

87
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,677
We got our hands on a demonstration film
of Oharra.

88
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,429
All real bricks and boards.
Nothing phony about any of it.

89
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,197
This was before he picked up
a facial scar somewhere.

90
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,876
This is where you'll be going.

91
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,716
An island fortress, really.

92
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,873
After the war...

93
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,352
...the nationality of the island
was uncertain.

94
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,913
And sometime after that, Han bought it.

95
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,712
What do you know about Han?

96
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,668
He lives like a king on that island,
totally self-sufficient.

97
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,712
All of his efforts, seemingly...

98
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,396
...are directed towards supporting
what he calls his school of martial arts.

99
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,190
Han's only contact with the outside world
is this tournament...

100
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,396
...which he holds every three years.

101
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,189
This was a stewardess, Mary King,
found floating in the harbor.

102
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,154
Nothing unusual
about a body in the harbor.

103
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,069
But this girl was last seen at a party
aboard Han's private junk.

104
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,950
They had reported her lost at sea
before the body was found.

105
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,276
We believe he selects attractive girls...

106
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,749
...methodically builds
their dependence on drugs...

107
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,116
...then sells them to an elite clientele
around the world.

108
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,558
What did the autopsy reveal
as the cause of death?

109
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,312
She did not drown.

110
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,675
She OD'd?

111
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,635
Yes.

112
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,428
Cause of death was a heroin overdose.

113
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,117
I gather you still don't have enough
to bust up his operation.

114
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,794
We know everything.
We can prove nothing.

115
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,596
We want you to go in there as our agent.

116
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,159
Get us our evidence.

117
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,959
And come out in one piece
to give it to you.

118
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,949
We'll give you anything you need.

119
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,198
Electronic equipment, weapons, anything.
Drink?

120
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,948
No, thanks.

121
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,589
Guns!

122
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,749
Now, why doesn't somebody pull a.45,
and bang, settle it?

123
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,439
No. No guns.

124
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,633
Look at this map here.

125
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,673
As you know, the possession of a weapon
is a serious offense here.

126
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,115
Han's island rests partly
within our territorial waters.

127
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,028
If we were given any reason to believe
that he has any kind of arsenal...

128
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,633
...we'd move in on him.

129
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,996
Besides, Han would never allow guns
on the island, anyway.

130
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,399
He had a bad experience with them once
and he's fearful of assassination.

131
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,675
Can't really blame him.
Any bloody fool can pull a trigger.

132
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,437
I guess I won't need anything.

133
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,838
There's a radio on the island.

134
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,071
We'll be monitoring it on the chance
that you can get to it.

135
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,639
And then you'll come?

136
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,199
Someone will.

137
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,990
We aren't an agency of enforcement.

138
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,033
We function as gatherers of information.

139
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,876
Evidence upon which
interested governments can act.

140
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,555
I see.

141
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,553
If there's any trouble,
you make a phone call.

142
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,274
Oh, by the way...

143
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,751
...two months ago, we managed to place
a female operative on the island.

144
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,870
Since then, we've lost her.

145
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,634
If she's still there,
she might have something.

146
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,517
Her name is Mei Ling.

147
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,837
Are you sure you won't have one?

148
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,194
No, thanks.

149
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,115
Now the time has come
to tell you something very difficult.

150
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,236
I am happy you have decided
to go to Han's tournament.

151
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,989
Yeah.

152
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,516
The last of the tournaments was held
three years ago.

153
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,149
I was in the city with your sister...

154
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,594
...at that time.

155
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,358
I didn't know that.

156
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,752
Many of Han's men had come in
from the island.

157
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,878
They were everywhere,
bullying and arrogant.

158
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,475
We were on our way into town.

159
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,309
Stay back!

160
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,789
Run!

161
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,751
Now you know the truth.

162
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,712
When you get to the city...

163
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,430
...pay your respects to your sister
and your mother.

164
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,674
I will, old man.

165
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,074
You will not agree
with what I am going to do.

166
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,554
It is contrary to all
that you have taught me.

167
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,317
And all that Su Ling believed.

168
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,673
I must leave.

169
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,115
Please try to find a way to forgive me.

170
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,799
Double or nothing?

171
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,674
That's about $1,000 a foot, Roper!

172
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,555
Why not?

173
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,834
I'm sorry, Mr. Roper isn't in right now.
May I take a message?

174
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,436
That's a tough shot, Mr. Roper.

175
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,679
Excuse me, fellows.

176
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,472
I say you can't make it.

177
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,199
What will you bet?

178
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,313
You've got to love him.

179
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,836
Come on, Roper, it's 175 big ones
by Monday, the 15th.

180
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,794
Only 150.

181
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,032
You forget the interest.

182
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,636
Well, maybe I ought to talk to Freddie.

183
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,392
You take advantage, Roper.

184
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,194
Come on, fellows.

185
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,158
It's the dough, Roper,
or we gotta break something.

186
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,874
You got it?

187
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,235
Freddie says this is for your own good.

188
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,153
Better confirm that flight
to Hong Kong for me.

189
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,950
How much do I have left in the bank?

190
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,234
$63.43.

191
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,348
It's all yours.

192
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,509
Thanks!

193
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,071
Only, I think you'll need it.

194
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,673
You want to bet?

195
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,638
Going on a trip, are you?

196
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,516
This jig's got a passport!

197
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,438
Where are you going, jig?

198
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,193
Where's the plane ticket for?

199
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,111
Hong Kong, via Hawaii.

200
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,318
He's not going to Hawaii.

201
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,111
Well, look what we've got here!

202
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,551
Assaulting a police officer.

203
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,872
Hey, soldier, shape it up!

204
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,951
Roper! Hey, how are you, man?

205
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,959
How am I? I'm glad to see you,
that's how I am.

206
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,190
How long has it been? Five?

207
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,078
Six years, man. Not as long as it seems.

208
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,999
Yeah, I know what you mean.

209
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,116
What have you been doing since 'Nam?

210
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,679
Hanging in a little bit.

211
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,990
- All these yours, man?
- Always first class.

212
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,593
Same old Roper.

213
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,874
Come here.

214
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,315
Parsons.

215
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,792
Yeah, from New Zealand. This man's
putting quite a collection together.

216
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,795
Know him?

217
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,432
No, never saw him before.

218
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,950
What do you know about this Han cat?

219
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,468
Just rumors. I hear he likes to live big.

220
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,676
They don't live so big over there.

221
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,350
Ghettos are the same all over the world.
They stink.

222
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,633
Same old Williams.

223
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,550
What have we got here? A little action.

224
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,473
Insects. I'll lay you $50 on the big one.

225
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,715
$50 on the big one. All right?

226
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,912
I'll give you five to one.

227
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,232
Would you bet $100?

228
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,789
You're on.

229
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,030
Come on, let's end this thing quickly.

230
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,518
Hey, that's it, come on,
just get him on his back!

231
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,314
For crying out loud,
would you believe that?

232
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,429
Oh, shit!

233
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,959
Do I bother you?

234
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,598
Don't waste yourself.

235
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,673
What's your style?

236
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,069
My style?

237
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,672
You can call it the art of fighting
without fighting.

238
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,990
The art of fighting without fighting?

239
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,239
Show me some of it.

240
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,355
Later.

241
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,239
All right.

242
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,556
Don't you think we need more room?

243
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,714
Where else?

244
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,837
That island, on a beach.
We can take this boat.

245
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,829
Okay.

246
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,232
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
Are you crazy?

247
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,597
Pull me in. Pull me in!

248
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,151
Don't try to pull yourself up...

249
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,231
...or I'll let go of the line.

250
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,311
Would you look at that?

251
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,511
A woman like that could teach you
a lot about yourself.

252
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,114
Welcome.

253
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,795
This way.

254
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,750
I'll show you to your rooms.
The banquet begins promptly at 8:00.

255
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,958
I think you'll find our little island
quite charming.

256
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,029
I hope you haven't spent all that money
you won from me yesterday.

257
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,073
I plan to win it back.

258
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,229
How?

259
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,595
You'll find out after you've lost it.

260
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,393
You seem to be very much at home here,
Mr. Roper.

261
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,879
This guy, Han,
has a great sense of hospitality.

262
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,355
And a fantastic sense of style.

263
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,193
Yeah, it's great.

264
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,596
Then why are you so apprehensive?

265
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,874
Apprehensive?

266
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,675
No, I was just wondering
whether it was okay to drink the water.

267
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,556
Mr. Roper, don't con me.

268
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,274
Want to bet?

269
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,714
No, I really don't think so. Thanks.

270
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,751
What's the matter? Are you on a diet?

271
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,150
I'd like to eat if I could find something
I could keep down.

272
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,953
I can't wait to meet our host.
I hear this is only one of his "B" parties.

273
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,515
Have you ever been
to a martial arts tournament like this?

274
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,075
Never.

275
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,270
I have a funny feeling
we're being fattened up for the kill.

276
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,277
Better keep an eye out for the referee.
Know what I mean?

277
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,349
Yeah.

278
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,958
Gentlemen, welcome!

279
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,237
You honor our island.

280
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,909
I look forward to a tournament...

281
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,795
...of truly epic proportions.

282
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,436
We are unique, gentlemen...

283
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,195
...in that we create ourselves.

284
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,356
Through long years of rigorous training,
sacrifice...

285
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,559
...denial, pain...

286
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,997
...we forge our bodies in the fire of our will.

287
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,230
But tonight, let us celebrate.

288
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,269
Gentlemen...

289
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,876
...you have our gratitude.

290
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,873
Mr. Williams!

291
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,153
Mr. Williams!

292
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,869
For me?

293
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,953
You shouldn't have.

294
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,069
But...

295
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,118
...l'll take you, darling.

296
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,075
And you.

297
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,229
And you.

298
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,908
And you.

299
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,034
Please understand, if I missed anyone...

300
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,238
...it's been a big day. I'm a little tired.

301
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,196
Of course, Mr. Williams.

302
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,790
You must conserve your strength.

303
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,355
Come in.

304
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,072
A gift, Mr. Lee.

305
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,670
If you don't see anything you like...

306
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,836
There was a girl at the feast tonight.

307
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,239
Which girl, sir?

308
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,358
The owner of this dart.

309
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,792
Yes, I know the one.

310
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,273
I'll send her to you.

311
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,710
Another fine mess you got me into.

312
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,675
Come in.

313
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,314
Well, well, one more lovely than the next.

314
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,072
What did you have in mind?

315
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,589
Pick one.

316
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,114
I already have.

317
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,399
A wise decision.

318
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,512
I want to talk to you...

319
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,715
...Mei Ling.

320
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,632
Where do you come from?

321
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,795
Braithwaite.

322
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,279
Let's be quiet.

323
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,959
Have you seen anything?

324
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,474
Nothing much. I'm kept in the palace...

325
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,193
...watched always.

326
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,676
I know nothing of Han's activities
away from the palace.

327
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,234
But I can tell you this:

328
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,231
- People disappear.
- Who?

329
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,311
The girls. Every one of them.

330
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,754
They're summoned to Han's at night,
and the next day they're gone.

331
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,511
I know I don't have much time.

332
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,438
You must attend the morning ritual
in uniform.

333
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,388
Outside.

334
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,671
Why are you not in uniform?

335
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,915
Gentlemen, let the tournament begin!

336
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,115
Bolo!

337
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,394
Good work, you made me some bread!

338
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,038
- Mr. Roper?
- I'm ready.

339
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,075
Okay.

340
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,996
I've got myself a real pigeon here.

341
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,229
Keep the action going for me, will you?

342
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,512
What do you think, Roper?

343
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,558
No sweat. Give my friend
eight to three all the way.

344
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,351
I'm finding out about myself.

345
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,276
This is the real me, definitely.

346
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,079
Do you like it here?

347
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,991
Yes. But a little lower.

348
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,234
I know. I mean here, on the island.

349
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,078
Yes, I like it here.

350
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,599
A little lower.

351
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,591
A man like you belongs here.

352
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,954
To you I'm just another pretty face.

353
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,239
Where are you going?

354
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,638
Out in the moonlight, baby.

355
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,950
It is not allowed. You must stay.

356
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,754
Good-bye.

357
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,679
A human fly!

358
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,991
It seems that one of you...

359
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,629
...was not content last night...

360
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,711
...with the hospitality...

361
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,959
...of the palace...

362
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,797
...and sought diversion...

363
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,070
...elsewhere on the island.

364
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,393
Who it was...

365
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,989
...is not important at this time.

366
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,710
What is important is that...

367
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,397
...my guards performed
their duties incompetently.

368
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,712
And now they must prove...

369
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,473
...themselves worthy to remain among us.

370
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,150
Are you shocked, Mr. Williams?

371
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,836
Only at how sloppily your man works.

372
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,109
Mr. Lee?

373
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,399
Are you ready?

374
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,991
Boards don't hit back.

375
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,475
Go!

376
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,394
Oharra!

377
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:57,835
Oharra!

378
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,674
Oharra's treachery has disgraced us.

379
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,713
If you want to talk about this,
I'll be in my room.

380
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,114
I got you.

381
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:31,873
Williams, come here! I want you to go
to Han's study as soon as possible.

382
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,754
Hey, Roper, I'll see you in half an hour.

383
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,550
- Mr. Han?
- You fought well yesterday.

384
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,271
Your style is unorthodox.

385
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,399
But effective.

386
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:00,598
It is not the art but the combat you enjoy.

387
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,635
The winning.

388
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,632
We are all ready to win.

389
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,120
Just as we are born knowing only life.

390
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,957
It is defeat that you must learn
to prepare for.

391
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,431
I don't waste my time with it.

392
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,909
When it comes, I won't even notice.

393
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,914
How so?

394
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,910
I'll be too busy looking good.

395
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:33,312
What were you looking for
when you attacked my guards?

396
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,269
It wasn't me.

397
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,989
You were the only man outside the palace.

398
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:42,438
I was outside, but I wasn't the only one.

399
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,432
You will tell me who else.

400
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,198
Mr. Han, suddenly I'd like
to leave your island.

401
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,873
It is not possible.

402
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,712
Bullshit, Mr. Han!

403
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,748
You come right out of a comic book!

404
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,519
Been practicing?

405
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,035
My friend, Williams,
is expecting me in my room.

406
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,076
I wanted to talk to you.

407
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:17,034
We will meet your friend, Williams, later.

408
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,310
Okay.

409
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,793
This is my museum.

410
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,199
It is difficult to associate these horrors...

411
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,272
...with the proud civilizations
that created them.

412
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:30,511
Sparta, Rome, the Knights of Europe,
the Samurai.

413
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,232
They worshipped strength...

414
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:38,273
...because it is strength
that makes all other values possible.

415
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,470
Nothing survives without it.

416
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,268
Who knows what delicate wonders
have died out of the world...

417
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,359
...for want of the strength to survive?

418
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:50,994
What's this?

419
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,069
A souvenir.

420
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,110
Up here.

421
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,875
A guillotine. No thanks.
This is the only angle I care to see it from.

422
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,712
If you please, Mr. Roper.

423
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:20,918
You mean you want me
to put my head on that thing?

424
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,439
An act of faith.

425
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,230
I'm a man of little faith, Mr. Han.

426
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:44,799
Very few people can be totally ruthless.

427
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,274
It isn't easy.

428
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,960
It takes more strength
than you might believe.

429
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,912
Now you've got eight more.

430
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,838
Then there is a point
you will not go beyond.

431
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,873
Faked out again.

432
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,034
This way.

433
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,274
Our power plant.

434
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,908
Oh, yes.

435
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,272
A lifetime of women.

436
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:11,114
A man's strength can be measured
by his appetites.

437
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,397
Indeed, a man's strength flows
from his appetites.

438
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,196
No, they are my daughters.

439
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,639
Your daughters?

440
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,432
I'm sorry. I thought...

441
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,397
I misunderstood. Miss Han...

442
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,359
Also, they are my most personal guard.

443
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,351
I admire your judgment.

444
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,239
Nobody is as loyal as Daddy's little girl.

445
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:43,989
Mr. Roper?

446
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,955
No, thanks, I'll get up myself.

447
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,193
Nice meeting you.

448
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,395
Opium!

449
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,713
We are investing in corruption, Mr. Roper.

450
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,952
The business of corruption
is like any other.

451
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,436
Provide your customers
with products they need, and...

452
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:20,469
...encourage that need a little bit
to stimulate your market and...

453
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,236
...soon your customers will depend on you.
I mean really need you.

454
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,276
It's the law of economics.

455
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,629
Right.

456
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,153
Here we are stimulating
quite another need.

457
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:51,397
You wonder why I am exposing
so much of myself?

458
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,749
I forget what I see very easily.

459
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,392
But then, why are you?

460
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:01,348
I'm hoping you'll join us,
represent us in the United States.

461
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,549
I'm beginning to understand
this tournament thing, the whole set-up.

462
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,713
It's a great way to recruit new talent.

463
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,633
And who are they?

464
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,789
Refuse found in waterfront bars.

465
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,394
Shanghaied?

466
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,439
Just lost, drunken men
who no longer care...

467
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,988
...where they find themselves
each morning.

468
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,517
You left some rather sizeable debts
in America.

469
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,200
Diner's Club hasn't called in my card yet.

470
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,076
There were some questions
which I was forced to ask.

471
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,198
I got no answers.

472
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,115
And you want me to join this?

473
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,357
There are certain realities.

474
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,273
I want us to have a clear understanding.

475
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:44,515
No.

476
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,755
There's no misunderstanding between us.

477
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,150
Help me!

478
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:57,639
I'm only 17!

479
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,032
Help me! Please, help me!

480
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,918
Come back, please!
You have to come back, please!

481
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:11,675
Quiet!

482
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,353
The battle with the guards
was magnificent.

483
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:57,310
Your skill is extraordinary.

484
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:01,949
And I was going to ask you to join us.

485
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:21,316
My God, this came in half an hour ago!
Why didn't I...

486
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,272
Put your colonel on.

487
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:27,719
Well, wake him up.

488
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,515
I don't care if he's not alone!

489
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:38,438
Damn it all, I don't care who he's with!
You bloody well put him on the line!

490
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:04,958
Good morning, Mr. Roper.

491
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,197
We have been waiting for you.

492
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,119
What's going on?

493
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:14,034
Would you be good enough to participate
in this morning's edification?

494
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:15,908
Edification?

495
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:23,511
What are you going to do to him?

496
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,556
Not me, Mr. Roper. You.

497
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:08,994
Like you said...

498
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,195
...there's a point I won't go beyond.

499
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:14,471
I was right about you.

500
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,350
We shall strive to be worthy
of your sense of grandeur.

501
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:22,198
I will find someone
with whom you can fight.

502
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,391
Quick, go destroy them! Kill!

503
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,679
Kill them!

504
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:17,395
Kill!

505
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,551
You have offended my family...

506
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:05,239
...and you have offended
the Shaolin Temple.

507
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,753
Remember...

508
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:25,153
...the enemy has
only images and illusions...

509
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:28,353
...behind which he hides his true motives.

510
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:33,157
Destroy the image,
and you will break the enemy.
