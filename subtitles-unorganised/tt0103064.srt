1
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,750
3 billon human lives
ended on August 29th, 1997.

2
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,955
The survivors of the nuclear fire
called the war Judgment Day.

3
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,312
They lived only
to face a new nightmare,

4
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,670
the war against the machines.

5
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,393
The computer which
controlled the machines, Skynet,

6
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,792
sent two terminators
back through time.

7
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,755
Their mission: to destroy the leader
of the human resistance:

8
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,991
John Connor. My son.

9
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,318
The first terminator was programmed
to strike at me.

10
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,478
in the year 1984,
before John was born.

11
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,398
It failed.

12
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,508
The second was set to strike
at John himself,

13
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,558
when he was still a child.

14
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,279
As before, the Resistance
was able to send a lone warrior.

15
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,471
A protector for John.

16
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,479
It was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.

17
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,712
I need your clothes, your boots,
and your motorcycle.

18
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,835
You forgot to say 'please'.

19
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,229
Take it.

20
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,553
You can't leave and take
the man's wheels, son.

21
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,751
Now get off before I put you down.

22
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,833
That's it, goddammit!

23
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,517
Art 31 David show me code 6

24
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,109
at the 6th street bridge in Santa F

25
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,231
on an electrical disturbance.

26
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,158
1 0-4. 31 David.

27
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,429
John! Get in there
and clean up that pigsty of yours.

28
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,149
Your foster-parents
are kinda dicks, huh?

29
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,994
I swear I've had it
with that goddamn kid.

30
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,669
Won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey. move!

31
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,155
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

32
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,194
Todd.
- What?

33
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,631
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

34
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,191
Oh. it's an emergency.
Hang on, I'll get right on it.

35
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,876
John! Come on get your ass inside,
do what your mother tells you!

36
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,276
She's not my mother. Todd !

37
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,272
This next patient is interesting.
Been following the case for years.

38
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,152
29-year-old female. . .

39
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,193
...diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

40
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,837
Depression, anxiety, violent
acting-out, delusions of persecution.

41
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,232
The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.

42
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,438
She believes in a machine
called a ''terminator'',

43
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,554
which looks human of course. was
sent back through time to kill her.

44
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,875
That's original!

45
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,755
And also that the father of her child
was a soldier.

46
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,315
sent back to protect her.
- No.

47
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,956
He was from the future too.
The year 2029,

48
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,390
if I remember correctly.

49
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,074
Here we are.

50
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,193
Morning, Sarah.

51
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,869
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?

52
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,475
Fine, Sarah.

53
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,352
She stabbed me in the kneecap
with my pen a few weeks ago.

54
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,075
Repeated escape attempts.

55
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,559
Let's move on, shall we?

56
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,312
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms.

57
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,558
See that she takes her Thorazine.
- Ill take care of it.

58
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,992
Time to take you meds, Connor.

59
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,399
You take it.

60
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,672
You gotta be good.
You're up for review this afternoon.

61
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,592
I'm not taking it.

62
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,832
I don't want any trouble.
- Ain't no trouble. . .

63
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,154
Yeah, zap her.

64
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,838
Last call, sugar.

65
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,118
Sweet dreams.

66
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,753
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

67
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,190
That's right.
What's he done now?

68
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,198
Could l speak with him, please?

69
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,595
Could if he was here.

70
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,553
He took off on his bike.
So he could be anywhere.

71
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,313
Do you have a photo of John?

72
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,828
Yeah, sure. Hold on.

73
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,590
You gonna tell me
what this is about?

74
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,075
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

75
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,473
He's a good looking boy.

76
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,189
Mind if l keep this picture?
- No. go on.

77
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,675
There was a guy here
looking for him too.

78
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,191
Big guy on a bike. Has that
got something to do with this?

79
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,838
No. l wouldn't worry about him.

80
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,198
Thanks for your cooperation.

81
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,113
Please insert your stolen card now!

82
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,109
PIN number...

83
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,511
Hurry up,
this is taking too long!

84
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,279
Go baby, go baby...

85
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,156
Alright! PIN number. . .

86
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,190
Who did you learn this from?
- My mom.

87
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,357
My real mom, l mean.

88
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,918
Withdraw 300 bucks.
Come on, baby. come on. . .

89
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,994
It worked !

90
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,472
Easy money! Come on!

91
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,752
Yeah!
- Piece of cake!

92
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,189
That her?

93
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,795
Yes.

94
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,596
So she's pretty cool, huh?
- No. she's a complete psycho.

95
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,555
That's why she's up at Pescadero,
the mental institute.

96
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,515
Tried to blow up
the computer factory,

97
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,189
but got shot and arrested.
- Oh shit.

98
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,514
She's a total loser.

99
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,316
Come on,
lets go spend some money!

100
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,118
Sarah.

101
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,188
Sarah, wake up.

102
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,036
Kyle?

103
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,869
You're dead.

104
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,839
Where's our son, Sarah?

105
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,356
They took him away from me.

106
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,109
He's the target now.
- l know!

107
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,277
He's alone.
You have to protect him.

108
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,113
I know.

109
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,948
You tell me how l am supposed
to do that.

110
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,276
He doesn't even
believe me anymore.

111
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,512
I've lost him.

112
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,393
You're strong, Sarah.

113
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,830
Stronger than you ever thought.
- No.

114
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,870
On your feet, soldier!

115
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,954
I love you. I always will.

116
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,759
I need you.
- Ill always be with you.

117
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,077
Remember the message?

118
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,954
''The future is not set.

119
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,756
There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves.''

120
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,275
Stay with me.

121
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,954
There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

122
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,759
Kyle, don't go!

123
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,949
Kyle!

124
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,273
It's like a giant strobe light,

125
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,912
burning right to my eyes.

126
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,829
Somehow l can still see.

127
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,754
Look,

128
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,479
we know the dream's the same
every night. Why do we have to...

129
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,512
Please continue.

130
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,354
The children look like burnt paper,

131
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,512
black,

132
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,552
not moving.

133
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,274
Then the blast wave hits them...

134
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,798
...and they fly apart like leaves.

135
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,829
Dreams about the end of the world
are very common, Sarah.

136
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,639
It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.

137
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,959
I know the date it happens!
- I'm sure it feels real to you.

138
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,711
On August 29th, 1997 it's going to
feel pretty fucking real to you too!

139
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,073
Anybody not wearing
two million sunblock

140
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,635
is gonna have
a real bad day, get it?

141
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,834
God, you think
you're safe and alive.

142
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,432
You're already dead. Everybody.
Him. You. You're dead already!

143
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,029
This place,
everything you see, is gone.

144
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,232
You're the one living
in a fucking dream, Silberman!

145
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,198
Because I know it happens.

146
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,435
It happens!

147
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,514
I feel much better now.

148
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,638
Clearer.

149
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,152
Yes. Your attitude has been
much improved lately.

150
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,797
It has helped to have a goal,

151
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,796
something to look forward to.

152
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,315
And what is that?

153
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,508
You said that if I showed
improvement after six months,

154
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,271
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing

155
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,516
and l could have visitors.

156
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,910
Well, it's been six months.

157
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,515
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

158
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,715
I see.

159
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,396
Let's go back
to what you were saying

160
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,636
about those terminator machines.

161
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,349
Now you think they don't exist?

162
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,031
They don't exist.
I know that now.

163
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,675
But you've told me
on many occasions

164
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,918
about how you crushed one
in a hydraulic press.

165
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,919
If I had, there would have been
some evidence.

166
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,634
They would've found
something at the factory.

167
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,194
I see.

168
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,189
So you don't believe anymore
that the company covered it up?

169
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,630
No, why would they?

170
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,348
Let's try a new position.
Right, there.

171
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,797
The neuronal sensors are correct,
because it works.

172
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,628
The neurons are all centered.

173
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,310
Maybe the inhibitors failed.

174
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,318
Mr. Dyson?

175
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,869
The materials team. . .

176
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,159
...is running another series
this afternoon, and you have to. . .

177
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,000
You have to sign it out.

178
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,599
Come on. Ill get it.

179
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,388
I know I haven't been here that long,
but I was wondering if you know...

180
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,635
Know what?

181
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,474
Well if you know,
where it came from.

182
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,513
I asked the same question once.
Know what they told me?

183
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,835
''Don't ask.''

184
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,915
Hello, Mr. Dyson. - How's it going?
- Okay.

185
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,039
Insert key.

186
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,994
Left and three, two, one, turn.

187
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,950
How are wife and kids?
- Great, thanks.

188
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,357
So what do you think, Doctor?

189
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,158
I've shown improvement,
haven't I?

190
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,110
Well, Sarah, here's the problem:

191
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,952
I know how smart you are.

192
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,269
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

193
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,154
I don't think you believe
what you're telling me.

194
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,075
If I put you in minimum security
you'll just try to escape again.

195
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,790
You have to let me see my son.
Please.

196
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,078
Please.

197
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,839
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

198
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,995
If I could just make a phone call.
- Im afraid not. Not for a while.

199
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,430
I don't see any choice but to
recommend to the review board

200
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,756
that you stay here
for another six months.

201
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,271
You son of a bitch!

202
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,556
You don't know what you're doing!
- Straighten her now!

203
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,910
You don't know what you're doing!

204
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,917
Model citizen.

205
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,440
You just missed him.
He left fifteen minutes ago.

206
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,359
I think he said he was going to
the Galleria. - Yeah.

207
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,028
The Galleria?

208
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,754
I'll get some quarters.
I'll be back, alright?

209
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,749
Girls, do you know John Connor?
- No.

210
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,353
You know this guy?

211
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,918
No, l don't know him.

212
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,753
John.
- Not now.

213
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,559
There's this cop scoping for you,
check it out.

214
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,597
Split, man, just go.
- Yeah.

215
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,995
I think I saw the kid
you're looking for.

216
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,472
You're not supposed to be here!

217
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,315
Get down!

218
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,235
Come on!

219
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,115
Goddamn!

220
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,436
Okay, time out. Stop the bike!

221
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,433
Come on, stop the bike.

222
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,711
Don't take this the wrong way.
You're a terminator, right?

223
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,912
Yes. Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101 .

224
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,111
Holy shit! You're really real!

225
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,788
You're like a machine underneath,
but sort of alive outside?

226
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,799
I'm a cybernetic organism.

227
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,310
Living tissue
over a metal endoskeleton.

228
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,279
This is intense.

229
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,474
Get a grip, John.

230
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,949
You're not here to kill me.
I figured that out for myself.

231
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,629
So what's the deal?

232
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,549
My mission is to protect you.

233
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,394
Yeah? Who sent you?

234
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,429
You did.

235
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,916
35 years from now
you reprogrammed me

236
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,316
to be your protector here,
in this time.

237
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,598
This is deep.

238
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,154
This other guy,
he's a terminator like you, right?

239
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,591
Not like me. A T-1000.

240
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,155
Advanced prototype.

241
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,511
You mean more advanced
than you are?

242
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,995
Yes. A mimetic polyalloy.

243
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,588
What does that mean?

244
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,115
Liquid metal.

245
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,113
Where are we going?
- We have to get out of the city.

246
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,231
And avoid the authorities.

247
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,557
I gotta stop by my house
and pick up some stuff. - Negative.

248
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,877
The T-1000 will definitely
try to reacquire you there.

249
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,072
You sure?
- l would.

250
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,553
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks

251
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,719
but I gotta warn them.

252
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,275
Shit! You got a quarter?

253
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,355
Hello?

254
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,755
Janelle? It's me.

255
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,998
John?
- Yeah.

256
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,318
Is everything alright?
- Sure.

257
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,832
Are you alright?
- Im fine.

258
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,989
John, it's late. l was
beginning to worry about you.

259
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,830
If you hurry, we can have dinner
together. I'm making beef stew.

260
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,276
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.

261
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,709
Where are you?

262
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,355
What's the goddamn dog
barking at?

263
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,954
Shut up,

264
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,594
you piece of shit!

265
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,995
The dog's barking.

266
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,032
Tell the kid
to get rid of that mutt.

267
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,673
Honey, it's late.

268
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,232
Could it already be there?

269
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,515
Are you okay?

270
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,389
I'm right here. I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

271
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,515
What's the dog's name?
- Max.

272
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,470
Janelle, what's wrong with Wolfy?

273
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,751
I can hear him barking.
Is he okay?

274
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,429
Wolfy's fine, honey.

275
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,875
Where are you?

276
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,917
Your foster-parents are dead.

277
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,188
I need a minute here.

278
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,393
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

279
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,672
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

280
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,035
Can't be real!

281
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,118
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

282
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,992
Only objects of equal size.

283
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,470
Why not a bomb
or something to get me?

284
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,355
It can't form complex machines.
Guns, explosives have chemicals,

285
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,631
moving parts.
It doesn't work that way.

286
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,717
But it can form solid metal shapes.

287
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,309
Like what?
- Knives and stabbing weapons.

288
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,349
These were taken
by a video surveillance camera

289
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,313
at the West Highland police station
in 1984.

290
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,593
He killed 17 police officers
that night.

291
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,118
Men with families.

292
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,193
Children.

293
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,275
These were taken
at a mall in Reseda. Today.

294
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,397
Ms. Connor, we know
you know who this guy is.

295
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,311
Look, l just sat here
and told you your son is missing,

296
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,468
that the foster-parents
have been murdered.

297
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,273
We know this guy's involved.

298
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,068
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

299
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,634
We're wasting our time.

300
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,119
Let's go.

301
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,439
Sorry, guys. She's just grown
more and more disconnected

302
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,438
from reality as time goes on.

303
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,070
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

304
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,553
If she clears at all and can give us
anything, Ill call you. - Sure.

305
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,556
Douglas, take her
back to her room, please. - Yes. sir.

306
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,998
Come on, let's go.

307
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,876
We spent a lot of time
in Nicaragua and places like that.

308
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,790
For a while she was
with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy,

309
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,229
running guns.

310
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,715
Then there were some other guys.

311
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,714
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from,

312
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,117
so she could teach me
how to be this great military leader.

313
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,629
Then she gets busted and it's like:

314
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,918
''Sorry kid. your mom's a psycho.
Didn't you know?''

315
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,150
Everything Ive been brought up
to believe is all bullshit.

316
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,559
I hated her for that.

317
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,476
But everything she said was true.

318
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,393
She knew.

319
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,910
And nobody believed her.

320
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,157
Not even me.

321
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,836
We gotta get her out of there.
- Negative.

322
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,714
The T-1000's highest
probability for success will be

323
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,230
to copy her and wait
for you to make contact.

324
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,238
Great. What happens to her?

325
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,068
The subject being copied
is terminated.

326
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,510
Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go now!

327
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,951
Negative.
It's not a priority.

328
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,595
Fuck you.
She's a priority to me!

329
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,598
Goddammit!
What's your problem?

330
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,909
Help!
- This does not help our mission!

331
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:32,309
Help me! Get this psycho off of me.

332
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,555
Let me go!

333
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,519
Why did you do that?

334
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,359
Because you told me to.

335
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,788
What?

336
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,238
You have to do what I say?

337
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,597
One of my mission parameters.

338
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,075
Prove it.

339
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,029
Stand on one foot.

340
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,195
Cool! My own terminator.

341
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,635
You okay, kid?

342
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,035
Take a hike, bozo.

343
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,712
Let's get out of here.
- What?

344
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,479
Fuck you, little dipshit.

345
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,232
Dipshit?

346
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,075
Put your leg down.

347
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,118
Did you call moi a dipshit?

348
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,879
Just trying to help this punk.

349
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,718
Grab this guy.

350
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,958
Now who's the dipshit,
you jock douchebag?

351
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,039
Put the gun down! Now!

352
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,835
Get out of here!

353
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,712
Come on, let's split!

354
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,072
You were gonna kill that guy!

355
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,198
Of course. Im a terminator.

356
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,632
Listen to me carefully, okay?

357
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,748
You're not
a terminator anymore. Alright?

358
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,155
You got that?

359
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,713
You just can't go round
killing people! - Why?

360
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,831
What do you mean ''why''?
'Cause you can't!

361
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,919
Why?
- Because you just can't, okay?

362
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,952
Trust me on this.

363
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,798
Look, Im gonna go get my mom.

364
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,953
And I order you to help me.

365
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,955
You have a Sarah Connor here?
- You're running kind of late.

366
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,917
They've been in there for an hour.
Hold on a second, Ill buzz you in.

367
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,550
Oh, here come your friends now.

368
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,519
Hey Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No. thanks.

369
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,759
How about a beer?
- Yeah, right.

370
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,677
I got a Full House.
- That's good.

371
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,997
Must be my lucky day.

372
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,795
Yeah, l think you're right
about number 24.

373
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,514
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

374
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,677
Same time?
- Yeah.

375
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,754
You broke my arm !

376
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,035
There's 215 bones
in the human body. That's one.

377
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,675
Now don't move!

378
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,559
What are you gonna do?

379
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,753
Why do we stop now?

380
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:51,631
You gotta promise
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

381
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,871
Right.
- Swear.

382
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,429
What?

383
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:59,759
Just put up your hand and say
''I swear l won't kill anyone.''

384
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:03,709
I swear l will not kill anyone.
- Alright. Let's go.

385
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,629
Visiting hours is 10 to 4.
Monday through Friday.

386
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,355
What are you doing?

387
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,917
You son of a bitch! You shot me!

388
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:35,995
He'll live.

389
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,155
Son of a bitch!

390
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,158
Let's all try to remain calm.
- Open it or he'll be dead!

391
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,431
There's no way, Connor. Let him go.

392
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,631
Open the door!
- It ain't gonna happen.

393
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,188
Take it easy, Sarah.

394
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,990
It won't work. Sarah.
You're no killer.

395
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,077
You're already dead, Silberman.

396
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,198
Everybody here dies.
So don't fuck with me!

397
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,153
Open the door.

398
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,435
Back off!

399
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,672
Get back or I'll pump him
full of this shit. I swear!

400
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,755
Don't move!

401
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,195
Drop the shit!

402
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,675
Do it! Do it!

403
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,194
Get in the office!

404
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,232
On the floor! Face down! Not you!

405
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,794
Open the door!

406
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,280
On the floor! Hold it open!
Face the wall!

407
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,715
Get her!

408
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,153
Come on, open it!

409
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,435
Come on!

410
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,438
She just broke it off.
- Open it.

411
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,873
Let's go around. come on!
Move it!

412
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,315
No!

413
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,869
No!

414
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,715
Mom! Wait!

415
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,235
No!

416
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,239
Help her.
- Wait here.

417
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,992
He'll kill us all!

418
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,995
He'll kill us all!

419
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,435
Mom, are you okay?

420
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,991
Come with me,
if you want to live.

421
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,959
It's okay. Mom.
He's here to help.

422
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,959
Go!

423
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,591
What the fuck is going on?

424
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,869
Get down!

425
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,555
Out of the car!

426
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,115
Right now!

427
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,515
I'm out.

428
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,678
Come on!
- Here.

429
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,555
Reload !

430
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,359
Next one.

431
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:10,835
Hang on!

432
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,708
Ready!

433
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:52,755
Here, drive!

434
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,196
There's nobody behind us.

435
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,913
Are you alright?
- Yeah.

436
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,033
Can you even see anything?

437
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,515
I see everything.

438
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,555
Cool.

439
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:02,715
Come here.

440
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,592
I said I was okay.

441
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,108
John, it was stupid of you
to go there.

442
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,511
You have to
be smarter than that.

443
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,793
You almost got yourself killed.
What were you thinking?

444
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,793
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me, do you understand?

445
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:28,149
You're too important!

446
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,479
You understand?

447
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,797
I had to get you
out of that place. I'm sorry.

448
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:44,676
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

449
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,795
What's wrong with your eyes?

450
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:54,795
Nothing.

451
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,479
So what's your story?

452
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,590
You okay?
- Fine.

453
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,398
Say, that's a nice bike.

454
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,598
Hey, watch it, lug nuts.

455
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,431
Listen,
you know what you are doing?

456
01:05:58,760 --> 01:05:59,954
I have detailed files

457
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:03,312
on human anatomy.
- l bet.

458
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,715
Makes you a more efficient killer,
right? - Correct.

459
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,513
Does it hurt when you get shot?

460
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:21,269
I sense injuries. The data
could be called pain.

461
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,991
John, help me with the light.

462
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,316
Will these heal up?
- Yes.

463
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,309
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

464
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,717
How long do you live,
I mean ''last'', whatever?

465
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,190
120 years with
my existing power cell.

466
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,472
Can you learn stuff you
haven't been programmed with?

467
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:44,197
So you can be. . .
you know. more human?

468
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,471
Not such a dork all the time?

469
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:53,749
My CPU is a neural-net processor.
A learning computer,

470
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:57,556
that Skynet presets to READ
only when we are sent out alone.

471
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,714
Doesn't want you
to do too much thinking.

472
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,955
No.

473
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,152
Can we reset the switch?

474
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,999
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

475
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,835
Do it.

476
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,836
Now open the port cover.

477
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,958
Pull to break the seal.

478
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,673
Good. Now remove
the shock damping assembly.

479
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,870
You can now access the CPU.

480
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,672
Do you see it?
- Yes.

481
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,315
Pull the CPU by its base tap.

482
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:10,915
Pull.

483
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,593
Can you see the pin switch?

484
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,319
No!

485
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,829
Out of my way, John!
- Don't kill him!

486
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,911
''It''. John, not ''him''.

487
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,510
Okay, ''it''. But we need ''it''.

488
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,189
Listen to me. Listen.

489
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,277
We're better off on our own.

490
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,473
He's the only proof of
the future, the war and that.

491
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:10,835
Maybe.

492
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,239
I don't trust it.

493
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,955
But he's my friend, alright?

494
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,754
You don't know what it's like
to kill these things.

495
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,952
If something goes wrong,
this could be our last chance.

496
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:26,629
If I'm supposed to
be this military leader,

497
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,878
maybe you start listening
to my ideas once in a while.

498
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,669
'Cause if my own mother won't,
how do you expect anyone else to?

499
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,749
Alright, play it your way.

500
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,638
Was there a problem?

501
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,197
No problem.

502
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,195
None whatsoever.

503
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,388
Are we learning yet?

504
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,836
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

505
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,594
Just head south.

506
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,713
Keep it under 65.
We don't want to be pulled over.

507
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,035
Affirmative.

508
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,553
No, no, no.

509
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,430
You got to listen to
the way people talk.

510
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,150
You don't say ''affirmative''
or some shit like that.

511
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,277
You say ''No problemo''.

512
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,110
If someone comes up to you
with an attitude, you say ''Eat me''.

513
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:33,268
And if you want to shine them
on. it's ''Hasta la vista, baby''.

514
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:36,350
Hasta la vista, baby.

515
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,433
Or ''Later, dickwad''.

516
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,439
If someone gets upset
you say ''Chill out''.

517
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:42,835
Or do combinations.

518
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,750
Chill out, dickwad.

519
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,353
You're getting it.

520
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,348
No problemo.

521
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,997
You got any cash?
- l got a couple of hundred bucks.

522
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:05,475
I'll give you half.

523
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:06,955
Mom!

524
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,113
Get some food.

525
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,152
No sense of humor.

526
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,518
And that's another thing:

527
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,029
lighten up a bit.

528
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:28,159
This severe routine is getting old.
You're acting like such a geek.

529
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:29,793
Smile once in a while.

530
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,308
Smile?

531
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,910
Yeah. You know, smile.

532
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,235
Watch.

533
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,592
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

534
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,113
Gimme a break.

535
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,954
Okay. Bad example.

536
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,633
See that guy over there?
That's a smile.

537
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,075
That's good.

538
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:13,318
You could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

539
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,956
Want some of my fries?

540
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,759
Do you need any help?

541
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,075
No.

542
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,239
Got you!
- No, you didn't!

543
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:37,869
Got you!
- You didn't!

544
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:47,313
We're not gonna make it, are we?

545
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,510
People. I mean.

546
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,672
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

547
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,474
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

548
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,310
I need to know
how Skynet gets built.

549
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,593
Who's responsible?

550
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,599
The man responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

551
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:13,749
Who is that?

552
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:17,953
The director of special projects at
Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

553
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,309
Why him?

554
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:25,828
In a few months he creates a
revolutionary microprocessor.

555
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,109
Go on. Then what?

556
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,672
In three years Cyberdyne
will become the largest supplier

557
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,598
of military computer systems.

558
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:36,952
Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers.

559
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,275
Becoming unmanned,

560
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,869
they fly
with a perfect operational record.

561
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,557
The Skynet funding bill is passed.

562
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,559
The system goes on-line
on August 4th, 1997.

563
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,991
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defense.

564
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,510
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

565
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,554
It becomes self-aware at 2: 14 a.m.
eastern time, August 29.

566
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:01,031
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

567
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,192
Skynet fights back.

568
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:07,030
Yes. It launches its missiles
against targets in Russia.

569
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,038
Why Russia?
They're our friends now.

570
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,437
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack

571
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:15,234
will eliminate its enemies here.
- Jesus.

572
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,879
How much do you know
about Dyson?

573
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,400
I have detailed files.

574
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,955
I want to know everything.

575
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,115
What he looks like.
Where he lives. Everything.

576
01:15:43,295 --> 01:15:44,444
Miles!

577
01:16:05,777 --> 01:16:08,849
You going to work all day?
- Im sorry, baby.

578
01:16:09,217 --> 01:16:10,970
This thing
is kicking my ass.

579
01:16:11,338 --> 01:16:15,013
It's Sunday. You promised to take
the kids to Raging Waters today.

580
01:16:16,898 --> 01:16:19,935
I can't. I'm on a roll.

581
01:16:33,101 --> 01:16:36,331
This is gonna blow 'em away.
It's a neural-net processor.

582
01:16:36,621 --> 01:16:37,974
I know. You told me.

583
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:40,855
It thinks and learns like we do.

584
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:43,611
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

585
01:16:43,902 --> 01:16:47,656
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

586
01:16:49,902 --> 01:16:51,460
Why is that so important?

587
01:16:51,743 --> 01:16:54,052
I need to know,
'cause sometimes I feel like

588
01:16:54,423 --> 01:16:56,539
I'm going crazy here.

589
01:16:58,063 --> 01:16:59,860
Baby. I am this close.

590
01:17:00,903 --> 01:17:01,858
Come here.

591
01:17:04,143 --> 01:17:07,772
Imagine a jet airliner
with a pilot that never gets tired,

592
01:17:08,064 --> 01:17:11,056
never makes mistakes,
never shows up with a hangover.

593
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:15,223
Meet the pilot.

594
01:17:15,824 --> 01:17:19,784
Why did we get married?
Have children? You don't need us.

595
01:17:20,305 --> 01:17:23,536
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

596
01:17:23,905 --> 01:17:25,941
But it doesn't love you like we do.

597
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:36,342
I'm sorry. Really.

598
01:17:36,866 --> 01:17:40,495
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

599
01:17:43,388 --> 01:17:45,379
Raging Waters?
- Yeah!

600
01:18:13,751 --> 01:18:15,309
Wait in the car.

601
01:18:33,433 --> 01:18:34,946
Enrique?

602
01:18:35,312 --> 01:18:36,951
You here?

603
01:18:52,035 --> 01:18:53,434
Pretty jumpy, Connor.

604
01:18:55,354 --> 01:18:56,309
What about you?

605
01:18:59,435 --> 01:19:01,312
Always on the lurk.

606
01:19:03,717 --> 01:19:06,674
Good to see you, Connor.
- l promised to make it back.

607
01:19:07,036 --> 01:19:09,231
Man, l knew it.
Good to see you.

608
01:19:09,717 --> 01:19:13,710
Yolanda. Get out here, we got
company. And bring some tequila!

609
01:19:13,997 --> 01:19:15,146
Oye. Big John?

610
01:19:15,518 --> 01:19:16,712
Que pasa?
- What's up?

611
01:19:17,197 --> 01:19:19,154
Who's your friend?
- He's cool.

612
01:19:19,518 --> 01:19:23,511
He's with me. He is Uncle Bob.

613
01:19:23,878 --> 01:19:25,470
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

614
01:19:25,959 --> 01:19:27,789
Uncle Bob. huh?

615
01:19:28,838 --> 01:19:30,112
Okay.

616
01:19:32,039 --> 01:19:33,028
How are you?

617
01:19:33,319 --> 01:19:35,514
How are you? You've gotten big.

618
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:38,231
Drink?

619
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:43,635
Uncle Bob?

620
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,953
Sarahlita, you pretty famous.

621
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,831
All over the TV. Pictures of
you. John, your big friend here.

622
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:53,471
Cops are going nuts looking for you.

623
01:19:54,401 --> 01:19:56,437
Take the kid, honey, will you?

624
01:19:56,801 --> 01:19:58,280
I just came for my stuff.

625
01:19:58,561 --> 01:20:01,122
I need clothes, food,
and one of your trucks.

626
01:20:01,481 --> 01:20:04,554
How about the fillings out of
my fucking teeth? - Now.

627
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:09,712
You two, you're on weapons detail.
- Come on. Lets go.

628
01:20:29,965 --> 01:20:32,195
One thing about my mom,

629
01:20:34,006 --> 01:20:36,042
she always plans ahead.

630
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:46,922
Excellent.

631
01:20:51,567 --> 01:20:52,716
Nothing down here.

632
01:20:57,488 --> 01:21:01,037
This is the best truck I got,
but the starter is gone.

633
01:21:01,328 --> 01:21:03,558
You got the time to change it out?
- Yeah.

634
01:21:03,848 --> 01:21:06,282
I'm gonna wait till dark
to cross the border.

635
01:21:06,569 --> 01:21:09,402
Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.

636
01:21:09,728 --> 01:21:12,196
You get out tonight too, okay?
- Sure.

637
01:21:13,689 --> 01:21:16,886
Just drop by any time
and totally fuck up my life.

638
01:21:22,290 --> 01:21:24,884
See. I grew up in places like this,

639
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:27,764
so l thought
that's how people lived:

640
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:31,523
riding around in helicopters,

641
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:34,047
learning how to blow shit up.

642
01:21:35,851 --> 01:21:40,368
But then, when my mom got busted,
I got put in a regular school.

643
01:21:41,011 --> 01:21:44,050
The other kids were into Nintendo.

644
01:21:57,813 --> 01:21:59,486
Are you ever afraid?

645
01:21:59,774 --> 01:22:00,968
No.

646
01:22:04,855 --> 01:22:06,004
Not even of dying?

647
01:22:07,295 --> 01:22:08,283
No.

648
01:22:13,136 --> 01:22:16,845
You don't feel any emotion about it
one way or another?

649
01:22:17,136 --> 01:22:19,604
No.
I have to stay functional

650
01:22:19,896 --> 01:22:21,807
until the mission is complete.

651
01:22:26,257 --> 01:22:28,087
Then it doesn't matter.

652
01:22:28,617 --> 01:22:31,973
Yeah. l have to stay functional too.
I'm ''too important''.

653
01:22:48,099 --> 01:22:49,452
That's definitely you.

654
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:03,053
Most of the guys my mom
hung round with were geeks.

655
01:23:03,621 --> 01:23:06,135
But there was this one guy.
He was kinda cool.

656
01:23:06,661 --> 01:23:08,891
He taught me engines.

657
01:23:09,182 --> 01:23:10,456
Hold here.

658
01:23:10,742 --> 01:23:13,210
Mom screwed it up, of course.

659
01:23:13,502 --> 01:23:16,335
She'd always tell
them about Judgment Day

660
01:23:16,622 --> 01:23:18,579
and me being this world leader.

661
01:23:18,862 --> 01:23:21,252
And that'll be all she wrote.

662
01:23:21,622 --> 01:23:25,855
Torque wrench, please.
- Here.

663
01:23:26,503 --> 01:23:29,495
I wish l could've met my real dad.

664
01:23:29,783 --> 01:23:30,977
You will.

665
01:23:31,263 --> 01:23:32,777
Yeah. l guess.

666
01:23:33,184 --> 01:23:35,493
When Im like, 45, I think.

667
01:23:37,424 --> 01:23:40,496
I'll send him back
through time to 1984.

668
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:45,894
He hasn't even been born yet.

669
01:23:47,785 --> 01:23:50,141
It messes with your head.

670
01:23:51,945 --> 01:23:53,584
The other bolt.

671
01:23:54,305 --> 01:23:55,261
Here.

672
01:24:01,987 --> 01:24:04,421
Mom and him
were only together one night.

673
01:24:04,746 --> 01:24:06,977
She still loves him. I guess.

674
01:24:07,426 --> 01:24:09,418
I see her crying sometimes.

675
01:24:09,707 --> 01:24:11,618
She denies it totally, of course.

676
01:24:11,907 --> 01:24:14,421
Like she got something
stuck in her eye.

677
01:24:18,268 --> 01:24:19,496
Why do you cry?

678
01:24:20,788 --> 01:24:22,301
You mean people?
- Yeah.

679
01:24:22,668 --> 01:24:23,818
I don't know.

680
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:25,747
We just cry, you know.

681
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:28,022
When it hurts.

682
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:35,829
Pain causes it?

683
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:38,580
No, it's different.

684
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:42,227
It's when there's nothing wrong
but you hurt anyway.

685
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:43,620
You get it?
- No.

686
01:24:45,351 --> 01:24:46,307
Alright! My man!

687
01:24:47,071 --> 01:24:48,026
No problemo.

688
01:24:48,351 --> 01:24:49,306
Gimme five.

689
01:24:51,871 --> 01:24:54,067
Put out your hand like this.
Come on.

690
01:24:55,432 --> 01:24:56,866
Alright. Now hit me.

691
01:24:57,152 --> 01:25:00,668
Gimme five. Do the same thing.
- Alright!

692
01:25:03,873 --> 01:25:05,943
Okay, that's good.
Up high. Up high.

693
01:25:07,154 --> 01:25:08,108
Five low.

694
01:25:08,793 --> 01:25:09,749
Too slow.

695
01:25:12,994 --> 01:25:14,825
Just kidding.
One more time.

696
01:25:20,834 --> 01:25:24,794
Watching John with the machine,
it was suddenly so clear.

697
01:25:25,275 --> 01:25:29,554
The Terminator would never stop.
It would never leave him,

698
01:25:30,516 --> 01:25:31,504
never hurt him,

699
01:25:31,876 --> 01:25:34,867
never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him,

700
01:25:35,155 --> 01:25:37,386
or say it was too busy
to spend time with him.

701
01:25:37,756 --> 01:25:40,224
It would always be there.

702
01:25:40,596 --> 01:25:42,905
And it would die to protect him.

703
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:47,476
Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went.

704
01:25:47,838 --> 01:25:51,831
This thing, this machine,
was the only one who measured up.

705
01:25:52,879 --> 01:25:56,758
In an insane world,
it was the sanest choice.

706
01:29:21,499 --> 01:29:24,013
She said you go south with him.

707
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:26,012
She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom !

708
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:28,619
Mom! Wait!

709
01:29:43,662 --> 01:29:44,617
''No fate.''

710
01:29:47,142 --> 01:29:49,736
No fate but what we make.

711
01:29:50,663 --> 01:29:52,062
My father told her this.

712
01:29:55,143 --> 01:29:59,740
I mean. I made him memorize it. Up
in the future, as a message to her.

713
01:30:00,544 --> 01:30:01,613
Never mind.

714
01:30:02,264 --> 01:30:03,492
Now okay,

715
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:07,944
the whole thing goes:
''The future is not set.

716
01:30:08,464 --> 01:30:11,662
There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves.''

717
01:30:12,024 --> 01:30:14,300
She intends to change the future.

718
01:30:14,785 --> 01:30:16,184
Yeah, l guess.

719
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:18,939
Oh shit!

720
01:30:19,306 --> 01:30:20,421
Dyson.

721
01:30:20,746 --> 01:30:22,737
Yeah, gotta be!

722
01:30:23,066 --> 01:30:24,818
Miles Dyson!

723
01:30:25,146 --> 01:30:26,625
She's gonna blow him away!

724
01:30:26,906 --> 01:30:28,259
Come on! Let's go!

725
01:30:40,987 --> 01:30:43,626
This is tactically dangerous.
- Drive faster.

726
01:30:43,988 --> 01:30:46,582
The T-1000 has
the same files that I do.

727
01:30:46,868 --> 01:30:49,781
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.

728
01:30:50,068 --> 01:30:51,946
I don't care. We've gotta stop her.

729
01:30:52,668 --> 01:30:56,502
Killing Dyson might actually
prevent the war. - I don't care!

730
01:30:56,789 --> 01:31:00,464
Haven't you learnt anything yet?
Why you can't kill people?

731
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:05,910
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die.

732
01:31:06,191 --> 01:31:09,069
But everybody's not like that!
We have feelings.

733
01:31:09,351 --> 01:31:11,148
We hurt. We're afraid.

734
01:31:13,631 --> 01:31:17,671
You gotta learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. Its important.

735
01:31:52,955 --> 01:31:56,426
Danny, l told you
to go to bed like your sister.

736
01:31:56,715 --> 01:31:58,353
Just a couple of minutes, Mom.

737
01:32:15,077 --> 01:32:17,194
Danny, your time is up.

738
01:32:17,477 --> 01:32:19,673
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

739
01:33:01,202 --> 01:33:02,157
Danny, just go!

740
01:33:12,523 --> 01:33:13,479
Oh my God !

741
01:33:20,604 --> 01:33:22,242
Just take Danny and go. Run!

742
01:33:23,925 --> 01:33:25,278
Oh, Jesus. Miles.

743
01:33:46,447 --> 01:33:48,039
Nobody fucking move!

744
01:33:48,728 --> 01:33:50,958
Don't hurt my daddy!
Get on the floor!

745
01:33:51,248 --> 01:33:52,840
Fucking down! Now!

746
01:33:53,528 --> 01:33:55,007
Get out of the way!

747
01:33:55,369 --> 01:33:56,847
Don't hurt him!

748
01:33:57,128 --> 01:33:59,359
Get on the floor! Fast!

749
01:34:02,649 --> 01:34:04,480
Just let the boy go.

750
01:34:04,849 --> 01:34:05,998
Shut up! Shut up!

751
01:34:07,729 --> 01:34:09,082
It's all your fault!

752
01:34:10,289 --> 01:34:12,121
It's all your fault!
- What?

753
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:14,408
I'm not gonna let you do it.

754
01:35:04,576 --> 01:35:05,929
Shit, we're too late.

755
01:35:10,816 --> 01:35:11,805
Check them.

756
01:35:15,616 --> 01:35:18,814
Look at me. Mom.
Are you hurt?

757
01:35:19,617 --> 01:35:20,811
Look at me.

758
01:35:22,937 --> 01:35:24,768
I almost. . .

759
01:35:25,378 --> 01:35:27,333
I almost. . .

760
01:35:36,298 --> 01:35:40,337
It'll be okay.
We'll figure something out, okay?

761
01:35:41,779 --> 01:35:43,098
Promise.

762
01:35:46,899 --> 01:35:49,175
You came here to stop me?

763
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:51,739
Yes, l did.

764
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:56,419
I love you. John.

765
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:01,093
I always have.

766
01:36:01,781 --> 01:36:03,214
I know.

767
01:36:10,261 --> 01:36:11,694
Clean penetration.

768
01:36:13,422 --> 01:36:15,060
No shattered bone.

769
01:36:15,421 --> 01:36:19,098
Hold here. Compression
should stop the bleeding.

770
01:36:28,624 --> 01:36:29,614
Who are you?

771
01:36:30,865 --> 01:36:32,184
Show him.

772
01:36:34,945 --> 01:36:38,460
Danny, l want you to come with me.
Show me your room.

773
01:37:06,427 --> 01:37:08,703
Oh, my God !

774
01:37:19,069 --> 01:37:21,424
Now listen to me very carefully.

775
01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:30,819
Dyson listened while
the Terminator laid it all down.

776
01:37:31,229 --> 01:37:36,668
Skynet. Judgment Day,
the history of things to come.

777
01:37:38,470 --> 01:37:40,745
It's not every day that you find out

778
01:37:41,031 --> 01:37:43,865
you're responsible
for 3 billion deaths.

779
01:37:44,152 --> 01:37:46,586
He took it pretty well.

780
01:37:47,953 --> 01:37:49,908
I feel like Im gonna throw up.

781
01:37:56,433 --> 01:37:57,582
You're judging me

782
01:37:58,113 --> 01:38:00,992
on things l haven't even done yet.

783
01:38:04,394 --> 01:38:06,703
How were we
supposed to know?

784
01:38:09,194 --> 01:38:11,185
Yeah. Right.

785
01:38:12,755 --> 01:38:15,508
How were you supposed to know?

786
01:38:16,075 --> 01:38:19,272
Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

787
01:38:20,035 --> 01:38:23,994
Men like you thought it up.

788
01:38:27,475 --> 01:38:29,626
You think you're so creative.

789
01:38:30,596 --> 01:38:33,315
You don't know what it's like
to create something.

790
01:38:33,677 --> 01:38:35,348
To create a life.

791
01:38:35,877 --> 01:38:37,435
To feel it growing inside you.

792
01:38:37,717 --> 01:38:41,266
All you know how to create
is death and destruction. - Mom!

793
01:38:41,997 --> 01:38:45,388
We need to be a little more
constructive here, okay?

794
01:38:45,717 --> 01:38:48,311
We still have to
stop this from happening.

795
01:38:48,597 --> 01:38:50,031
But I thought...

796
01:38:50,558 --> 01:38:54,267
Aren't we changing things?
Changing the way it goes?

797
01:38:54,559 --> 01:38:55,628
That's right!

798
01:38:55,919 --> 01:38:59,195
There's no way I'm gonna
finish the processor. Not now.

799
01:38:59,479 --> 01:39:00,958
Forget it. Im out of it.

800
01:39:01,599 --> 01:39:04,114
I quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.
- Not good enough.

801
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:09,031
No one must follow your work.
- Right, then...

802
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:13,639
We have to destroy the stuff
at the lab. The files, drives...

803
01:39:14,001 --> 01:39:16,231
Everything. Everything here.

804
01:39:17,161 --> 01:39:19,834
Everything! l don't care.

805
01:39:22,082 --> 01:39:24,516
Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

806
01:39:24,802 --> 01:39:27,555
In a vault at Cyberdyne.
From the other one like you.

807
01:39:27,842 --> 01:39:29,595
The CPU from the first terminator.

808
01:39:29,963 --> 01:39:31,954
Son of a bitch. I knew it!

809
01:39:32,363 --> 01:39:34,638
They told us
not to ask where they got it.

810
01:39:35,003 --> 01:39:36,959
Those lying motherfuckers!

811
01:39:37,323 --> 01:39:38,756
It was radically advanced.

812
01:39:39,124 --> 01:39:42,514
It was smashed, it didn't work.
But it gave us ideas.

813
01:39:42,884 --> 01:39:45,478
Took us in new directions.
Things we'd never...

814
01:39:48,044 --> 01:39:51,354
All my work is based on it.
- It must be destroyed.

815
01:39:54,004 --> 01:39:56,439
Can you get us in, past security?

816
01:39:56,805 --> 01:39:58,204
I think so, yeah.

817
01:39:58,485 --> 01:39:59,600
When?

818
01:40:03,285 --> 01:40:04,240
Now?

819
01:40:08,406 --> 01:40:11,079
The future, always so clear to me,

820
01:40:11,366 --> 01:40:13,880
had become like
a black highway at night.

821
01:40:14,167 --> 01:40:16,761
We were
in uncharted territory now,

822
01:40:17,047 --> 01:40:19,402
making up history as we went along.

823
01:40:53,851 --> 01:40:54,806
Hi.

824
01:40:57,091 --> 01:40:58,650
Carl, right?

825
01:40:59,812 --> 01:41:01,928
Friends from outta town,
thought I'd. . .

826
01:41:03,092 --> 01:41:04,605
...show them around.

827
01:41:04,972 --> 01:41:07,806
You know
the rules concerning visitors.

828
01:41:08,172 --> 01:41:09,764
I need authorization...

829
01:41:11,293 --> 01:41:12,408
I insist.

830
01:41:13,452 --> 01:41:14,647
Don't even think about it.

831
01:41:28,374 --> 01:41:31,333
Takes 2 keys to open the vault.
Turned simultaneously.

832
01:41:31,615 --> 01:41:33,810
The other one is
at the security station.

833
01:41:35,495 --> 01:41:36,450
Gibbons.

834
01:41:40,855 --> 01:41:44,769
Come on, man,
you can't leave the desk like that.

835
01:41:49,457 --> 01:41:50,446
Oh, shit.

836
01:42:07,579 --> 01:42:09,058
My card should access this.

837
01:42:13,859 --> 01:42:15,612
What is it?
- Dammit.

838
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:18,250
The silent alarms been tripped.

839
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:26,980
It's neutralized
all the codes in the building.

840
01:42:27,261 --> 01:42:29,216
Nothing'll open anywhere now.

841
01:42:29,501 --> 01:42:31,298
We have to abort.

842
01:42:31,581 --> 01:42:32,570
No.

843
01:42:34,461 --> 01:42:37,419
We do it all the way! Okay?

844
01:42:40,462 --> 01:42:43,135
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

845
01:42:43,503 --> 01:42:46,380
I think it's that guy
from the mall. - It is the guy!

846
01:42:46,662 --> 01:42:48,460
Him and the woman.

847
01:42:49,463 --> 01:42:52,057
Just send everything
you've got in the area.

848
01:42:54,543 --> 01:42:57,900
I have a personal entry code
for the lab that may still work.

849
01:43:02,183 --> 01:43:04,745
It's no good.
- Let me try mine.

850
01:43:09,506 --> 01:43:11,143
John! Fire-in-the-hole!

851
01:43:23,587 --> 01:43:25,703
Wait! You can't go in there!

852
01:43:26,347 --> 01:43:28,622
The fire's set off the halo system !

853
01:43:34,508 --> 01:43:37,500
You have to wait a few minutes,
until the gas clears.

854
01:43:39,188 --> 01:43:40,143
Put this on.

855
01:43:54,349 --> 01:43:55,988
Alright, let's get to work.

856
01:44:16,911 --> 01:44:19,710
All units in the vicinity.
All units able to respond:

857
01:44:19,992 --> 01:44:24,430
A 211 in progress at 2144 Kramer
Street, the Cyberdyne building.

858
01:44:24,713 --> 01:44:26,271
Suspect 1 is white, female.

859
01:44:26,554 --> 01:44:29,670
Identified as: last name Connor.
first name Sarah,

860
01:44:29,954 --> 01:44:32,514
escaped from
Pescadero State Hospital.

861
01:44:32,794 --> 01:44:33,988
Suspect 2: white, male. . .

862
01:44:38,155 --> 01:44:41,989
All the disks in my office. All the
disks in that office over there.

863
01:44:42,275 --> 01:44:44,106
Everything behind my desk.

864
01:44:44,395 --> 01:44:46,273
All the processors on my left.

865
01:44:46,555 --> 01:44:48,193
We'll blow it up with the CP4.

866
01:45:01,957 --> 01:45:03,231
Could l . . .

867
01:45:03,757 --> 01:45:05,190
Excuse me...

868
01:45:07,358 --> 01:45:09,348
Could l borrow that thing?

869
01:45:18,518 --> 01:45:20,634
I worked a lot
of years on this thing.

870
01:45:24,638 --> 01:45:28,598
Give me that location again.
- 2111 , Kramer.

871
01:45:28,879 --> 01:45:32,315
The suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.

872
01:46:21,605 --> 01:46:22,958
Alright,

873
01:46:23,285 --> 01:46:24,718
7-2-5-6.

874
01:46:27,125 --> 01:46:28,241
Yes!

875
01:46:32,046 --> 01:46:33,274
Easy money.

876
01:46:41,646 --> 01:46:45,322
Oh, shit.
Not good. Not good.

877
01:46:49,128 --> 01:46:52,005
How we doing?
- Primal cord is set.

878
01:46:52,367 --> 01:46:56,043
One more barrel.
Two more minutes.

879
01:46:58,489 --> 01:47:00,878
How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

880
01:47:01,448 --> 01:47:02,963
Piece of cake.

881
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:04,808
We got company.
- Police?

882
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:07,764
How many?
- All of them, l think.

883
01:47:08,410 --> 01:47:10,970
Go! I'll finish here.

884
01:47:13,971 --> 01:47:16,803
I'll take care of the police.
- Wait, you swore. . .

885
01:47:19,931 --> 01:47:21,444
Trust me.

886
01:47:34,092 --> 01:47:35,970
Hey you at the window,

887
01:47:36,333 --> 01:47:39,723
drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head.

888
01:47:42,213 --> 01:47:44,602
That's a damn mini-gun!

889
01:48:05,855 --> 01:48:08,370
Come on! Go!

890
01:48:37,859 --> 01:48:39,372
Go! Go!

891
01:48:54,221 --> 01:48:55,893
Fire!

892
01:49:12,783 --> 01:49:16,537
We go the same time to the left.
One, two, three, go!

893
01:49:28,224 --> 01:49:30,374
Alright.
In order to get that out, you. . .

894
01:49:37,745 --> 01:49:41,340
We got Skynet by the balls now,
don't we? Come on, let's book!

895
01:49:42,826 --> 01:49:44,054
Hold your fire!

896
01:50:08,508 --> 01:50:10,783
Ready to rock?
- Ready.

897
01:50:14,069 --> 01:50:15,867
Time to go. Now.

898
01:50:16,589 --> 01:50:18,819
Take this. They'll use gas.

899
01:50:19,670 --> 01:50:21,069
Get started on the door.

900
01:50:21,710 --> 01:50:23,541
Miles, hand me the detonator.

901
01:50:46,192 --> 01:50:47,545
Mom! Mom !

902
01:51:33,557 --> 01:51:36,709
Shit! She's in the clean room.
There's no way out of there.

903
01:51:46,118 --> 01:51:47,074
Get down!

904
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:55,233
Here.

905
01:52:19,481 --> 01:52:22,315
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

906
01:52:26,923 --> 01:52:27,879
Fall back!

907
01:52:28,243 --> 01:52:29,471
Everybody out!

908
01:52:29,843 --> 01:52:31,323
Move it! Now! Go!

909
01:53:06,126 --> 01:53:07,195
We have a war zone here.

910
01:53:39,009 --> 01:53:40,284
Shut your eyes.

911
01:53:45,971 --> 01:53:48,691
Stay here. Ill be back.

912
01:53:56,932 --> 01:53:58,570
Down on the floor, face down!

913
01:54:01,533 --> 01:54:02,682
On the floor, now!

914
01:54:05,573 --> 01:54:07,052
Okay, drop him !

915
01:55:23,301 --> 01:55:24,495
Here, hold this.

916
01:55:57,664 --> 01:55:58,619
Go!

917
01:56:49,030 --> 01:56:50,258
Get out!

918
01:57:09,151 --> 01:57:12,462
Listen, no matter what happens,
you stay under these vests.

919
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:14,629
You got it?
- Yeah.

920
01:57:29,474 --> 01:57:31,509
Chopper is coming in!
- Its him.

921
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:32,350
Stay down!

922
01:59:37,447 --> 01:59:38,402
Hello?

923
01:59:44,368 --> 01:59:45,642
Goddamn,

924
01:59:46,008 --> 01:59:47,077
you alright?

925
01:59:53,928 --> 01:59:56,204
Come on, Mom,
we gotta get out.

926
01:59:58,129 --> 01:59:59,881
Take the shotgun.
- Okay.

927
02:00:03,129 --> 02:00:05,041
Are you hurt?

928
02:00:17,531 --> 02:00:19,328
Holy shit. Come on!

929
02:00:19,771 --> 02:00:21,966
We need your truck.
- Hurry!

930
02:00:27,972 --> 02:00:29,247
Hurry!
- Get in.

931
02:00:39,334 --> 02:00:40,926
What the hell...

932
02:00:47,294 --> 02:00:49,206
I'm bleeding bad !
- Keep pressure on it.

933
02:00:50,575 --> 02:00:52,372
Here, this'll work.

934
02:00:58,415 --> 02:00:59,370
He's gaining !

935
02:01:02,176 --> 02:01:04,644
Step on it!
- This is the vehicle's top speed.

936
02:01:05,016 --> 02:01:07,815
I can get out
and run faster than this!

937
02:01:16,937 --> 02:01:19,007
He's coming up, to the right.

938
02:01:43,820 --> 02:01:46,415
Drive a minute.
- Where the hell are you going?

939
02:01:52,981 --> 02:01:54,540
Take the off ramp.

940
02:02:09,343 --> 02:02:10,378
Hold on!

941
02:02:53,987 --> 02:02:55,466
Don't stop!

942
02:03:02,749 --> 02:03:04,148
Go straight!

943
02:03:21,950 --> 02:03:23,543
Get the hell out of here!

944
02:03:29,151 --> 02:03:30,982
Get out of here. Let's go!

945
02:04:45,799 --> 02:04:48,758
Hasta la vista, baby.

946
02:05:35,644 --> 02:05:36,918
We don't have much time.

947
02:05:58,967 --> 02:06:00,241
Let's go!

948
02:06:01,567 --> 02:06:03,717
Come on, we gotta get out of here!

949
02:06:04,247 --> 02:06:05,202
Get up!

950
02:06:17,809 --> 02:06:19,242
Hand me the shotgun.

951
02:06:24,209 --> 02:06:25,562
Put your weight on me, Mom.

952
02:06:27,289 --> 02:06:28,279
Hurry!

953
02:06:32,609 --> 02:06:33,645
Come on, Mom !

954
02:06:40,570 --> 02:06:42,482
Come on, Mom, get up!

955
02:07:11,694 --> 02:07:13,207
This way. Come on!

956
02:07:39,857 --> 02:07:41,051
Wait.

957
02:07:41,457 --> 02:07:43,334
Wait, no, it's too hot.

958
02:07:43,657 --> 02:07:44,772
Go back!

959
02:07:52,978 --> 02:07:54,809
Run!
- No, we stick together.

960
02:07:55,218 --> 02:07:57,778
John, you gotta go now.

961
02:07:58,219 --> 02:08:00,574
Go now!
- No!

962
02:09:10,586 --> 02:09:14,864
Take these steps. Go.

963
02:09:20,908 --> 02:09:23,342
Help me.
- l got you. Come on.

964
02:09:56,711 --> 02:09:59,271
Grab the chain. Grab it!

965
02:10:00,231 --> 02:10:01,744
Grab it! Go!

966
02:10:12,713 --> 02:10:14,146
Mom! Come on!

967
02:11:03,398 --> 02:11:04,547
Call to John.

968
02:11:06,199 --> 02:11:07,153
No.

969
02:11:07,799 --> 02:11:08,993
I know this hurts.

970
02:11:11,319 --> 02:11:12,308
Call John.

971
02:11:29,001 --> 02:11:30,433
Call to John now.

972
02:11:33,041 --> 02:11:34,316
Fuck you.

973
02:14:43,421 --> 02:14:45,331
John! Help!

974
02:14:52,421 --> 02:14:53,376
John!

975
02:15:08,024 --> 02:15:09,377
Help me.

976
02:15:12,784 --> 02:15:13,739
Out of the way, John!

977
02:15:17,305 --> 02:15:18,499
Shoot!

978
02:16:10,829 --> 02:16:12,229
Down!

979
02:17:42,640 --> 02:17:43,755
Get up.

980
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:45,109
Come on.

981
02:17:46,800 --> 02:17:48,200
Holy shit!

982
02:17:48,560 --> 02:17:50,869
I need a vacation.

983
02:18:03,921 --> 02:18:05,150
Is it dead?

984
02:18:06,442 --> 02:18:07,511
Terminated.

985
02:18:11,322 --> 02:18:12,471
Will this melt in there?

986
02:18:15,762 --> 02:18:17,081
Yes. Throw it in.

987
02:18:21,483 --> 02:18:22,677
Adios.

988
02:18:24,604 --> 02:18:25,719
And the chip.

989
02:18:40,325 --> 02:18:41,758
It's over.

990
02:18:44,605 --> 02:18:45,833
No.

991
02:18:48,725 --> 02:18:50,205
There is one more chip.

992
02:18:55,046 --> 02:18:56,684
And it must be
destroyed also.

993
02:19:02,328 --> 02:19:03,283
Here!

994
02:19:03,768 --> 02:19:08,603
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

995
02:19:15,489 --> 02:19:16,444
No!

996
02:19:20,370 --> 02:19:21,962
I'm sorry, John!

997
02:19:22,369 --> 02:19:24,008
It'll be okay. Stay with us!

998
02:19:25,410 --> 02:19:28,527
I have to go away.
- No don't do it, please don't go.

999
02:19:28,890 --> 02:19:31,451
I must go away. John.
- No.

1000
02:19:32,131 --> 02:19:33,085
No, wait.

1001
02:19:33,451 --> 02:19:34,679
You don't have to.

1002
02:19:35,051 --> 02:19:36,006
Sorry.

1003
02:19:37,291 --> 02:19:39,089
No, don't do it. Don't go!

1004
02:19:39,451 --> 02:19:41,089
It has to end here.

1005
02:19:42,572 --> 02:19:45,245
I order you not to go.

1006
02:19:53,213 --> 02:19:55,568
I know now why you cry.

1007
02:19:57,413 --> 02:20:00,291
But it's something I can never do.

1008
02:20:33,097 --> 02:20:34,576
Goodbye.

1009
02:22:09,947 --> 02:22:12,586
The unknown future
rolls toward us.

1010
02:22:12,947 --> 02:22:15,781
I face it for the first time
with a sense of hope.

1011
02:22:16,747 --> 02:22:18,942
Because if a machine, a terminator,

1012
02:22:19,268 --> 02:22:21,623
can learn the value of human life,

1013
02:22:22,068 --> 02:22:24,662
maybe we can too.
