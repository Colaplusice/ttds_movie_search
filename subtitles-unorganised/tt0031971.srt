1
00:02:03,127 --> 00:02:05,028
These hills here are full of Apaches.

2
00:02:05,096 --> 00:02:07,122
They've burnt every
ranch building in sight.

3
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:08,599
He had a brush with them last night.

4
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,036
Says they're being stirred up
by Geronimo.

5
00:02:11,907 --> 00:02:13,136
How do we know he isn't lying?

6
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:16,373
No. He's a Cheyenne.
They hate Apaches worse than we do.

7
00:02:16,447 --> 00:02:19,009
- Clear the wires for Lordsburg.
- That's Lordsburg now, sir.

8
00:02:19,085 --> 00:02:22,113
They seem to have something
very urgent to tell you, sir.

9
00:02:22,657 --> 00:02:25,183
- Well, what's wrong?
- The line went dead, sir.

10
00:02:25,294 --> 00:02:28,265
- What have you got there?
- Only the first word, sir.

11
00:03:06,993 --> 00:03:09,554
- How'd it go, Buck?
- Oh, so-so.

12
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,098
Got the payroll for the mining company?

13
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,828
Yes sir, right here in this box.

14
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:14,460
Good, give me a lift here, Jim,
would you?

15
00:03:14,538 --> 00:03:17,236
Jim, I'll pay you that two bits
when I come through.

16
00:03:17,309 --> 00:03:20,211
- Okay, Buck.
- Now you kids get away from that wheel.

17
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:23,910
Well sir, we ran into a little snow
up there. It weren't bad, though.

18
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:27,617
But you fellows better prepare
for a good frost.

19
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:29,353
Passengers out for Tonto.

20
00:03:32,232 --> 00:03:34,895
You better get out and stretch
your legs, I mean your limbs, ma'am.

21
00:03:34,969 --> 00:03:36,494
We're gonna change horses here.

22
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:38,503
Is there a place here where
I can get a cup of tea?

23
00:03:38,576 --> 00:03:42,104
Well yes, ma'am, you can get a cup of
coffee at the hotel across the street.

24
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:43,809
- Thank you, driver.
- You look a little...

25
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:46,285
- I'll be all right, thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

26
00:03:51,429 --> 00:03:53,762
- Why, Lucy Mallory!
- Nancy!

27
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,066
- How are you, Captain Whitney?
- Fine thanks, Mrs. Mallory.

28
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:59,331
Why, whatever are you doing in Arizona?

29
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:02,140
I'm joining Richard in Lordsburg.
He's there with his troops.

30
00:04:02,213 --> 00:04:04,944
He's a lot nearer than that.
He's been ordered to Dry Fork.

31
00:04:05,016 --> 00:04:06,951
Why that's the next stop
of the stagecoach.

32
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,888
You'll be with your husband
in a few hours.

33
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:18,767
I'm so glad to see you, Lucy.
Sit down and have a cup of coffee.

34
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:21,867
- You must be tired from that long trip.
- Who is that gentleman?

35
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:25,179
- Hardly a gentleman, Mrs. Mallory.
- I should think not!

36
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:27,112
He's a notorious gambler.

37
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:35,897
Hello Mitch, howdy Frank. Marshall,
I'm looking for my shotgun guard.

38
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:37,227
Is he here?

39
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,930
Out with the posse, Buck,
trying to catch the Ringo Kid.

40
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:42,406
- I thought Ringo was in the pen.
- He was.

41
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:44,838
Busted out? Well, good for him.

42
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:48,144
My guess, the Kid's aimin' to get even
with them Plummer boys.

43
00:04:48,318 --> 00:04:50,617
Their testimony sent him
to the penitentiary.

44
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:54,592
Well all I got to say is he better stay
away from that there Luke Plummer.

45
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,997
By gosh, Luke's run all of
Ringo's friends out of Lordsburg.

46
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,770
Why, the last trip there I seen him
hit a rancher on the head...

47
00:05:00,837 --> 00:05:02,031
...with the barrel of his gun.

48
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:05,008
He just laid it wide open
like a butchered steer.

49
00:05:05,077 --> 00:05:08,242
- You seen Luke Plummer in Lordsburg?
- Yes siree!

50
00:05:14,024 --> 00:05:16,654
You boys take care of the office
for a couple of days.

51
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:18,857
I'm going to Lordsburg with Buck.

52
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:20,662
I'm going to ride shotgun!

53
00:05:20,735 --> 00:05:23,466
Oh gosh, when'll I learn to keep
my big mouth shut?

54
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,780
Here's the payroll, Mr. Gatewood.

55
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:33,480
You know, ever since I opened this bank,
I've been trying to tell those people...

56
00:05:33,555 --> 00:05:35,956
...to deposit their payroll
six months in advance.

57
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:37,686
It's good sound business.

58
00:05:37,761 --> 00:05:39,993
It's good business for you,
Mr. Gatewood.

59
00:05:40,065 --> 00:05:42,899
Well, there's your receipt, $50,000.

60
00:05:44,071 --> 00:05:47,770
And remember this: What's good
for the banks, is good for the country.

61
00:06:10,546 --> 00:06:11,740
Get out.

62
00:06:11,814 --> 00:06:14,842
I'm keeping your trunk, 'cause
you ain't paid your rent!

63
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:19,556
"Is this the face that wrecked
a thousand ships...

64
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:22,958
"...and burned the towerless
tops of llium?

65
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:27,471
"Farewell, fair Helen!"

66
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,608
Can they make me leave town
when I don't want to go?

67
00:06:34,683 --> 00:06:36,949
- Do I have to go?
- Dallas, don't you go makin' no fuss.

68
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:39,422
Do I have to go, Doc,
just because they say so?

69
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:42,428
Now Dallas, I've got my orders.
Don't blame these ladies.

70
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:44,226
- It ain't them.
- It is them!

71
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,869
Doc, haven't I any right to live?
What have I done?

72
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:54,173
We're the victims of a foul disease
called social prejudice, my child.

73
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,711
These dear ladies of
the Law and Order League...

74
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:59,312
...are scouring out
the dregs of the town.

75
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:03,718
Come on, be a proud,
glorified dreg, like me.

76
00:07:04,196 --> 00:07:06,222
You get goin', Doc, you're drunk.

77
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,170
Two of a kind.
Just two of a kind.

78
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:11,533
Take my arm, Madame la Comtesse!

79
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:15,201
The tumbrel awaits, to the guillotine!

80
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,112
Wait till I get my badge, girls.
I'll join you.

81
00:07:45,427 --> 00:07:49,263
If ever you go east, brother,
come out to our house for dinner.

82
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:54,305
No one in Kansas City, Kansas, sets
a better table than my dear wife Violet.

83
00:07:56,311 --> 00:07:59,282
Jerry, I admit as one man
to another, that...

84
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:03,345
...economically, I haven't been
of much value to you, but...

85
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,985
...suppose you could put one on credit.

86
00:08:08,663 --> 00:08:12,294
If talk was money, Doc,
you'd be the best customer I got.

87
00:08:13,136 --> 00:08:15,868
- I'm leaving town, Jerry.
- Honest?

88
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:21,013
Yes, old friend, and I thought you might,
out of memory of our many happy...

89
00:08:21,216 --> 00:08:23,811
All right, Doc. Just this one.

90
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:25,521
Thank you, Jerry.

91
00:08:27,025 --> 00:08:29,655
Here's a man goin' on
the stagecoach with you.

92
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:31,631
He's an easterner from
Kansas City, Missouri.

93
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:33,634
Kansas City, Kansas, brother.

94
00:08:33,702 --> 00:08:35,295
Your health, Reverend.

95
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:39,341
I'm not a clergyman.
My name is Peacock. I'm a...

96
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:41,241
He's a whisky drummer.

97
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:49,217
- Well how are you Mr. Haycock?
- Peacock.

98
00:08:49,694 --> 00:08:53,689
Don't tell me sir, I know, I know.
A familiar name and an honored name.

99
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,200
I never forget the face of a friend.

100
00:08:56,672 --> 00:08:57,730
Samples?

101
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,409
Rye.

102
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:33,189
I want $5, Henry.

103
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,031
Certainly, my dear. Certainly.

104
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,069
Well, what is it to be this time,
my dear? A pair of shoes...

105
00:09:38,136 --> 00:09:41,073
I want to pay the butcher.
Dinner is at 12 o'clock.

106
00:09:41,141 --> 00:09:42,369
Don't worry, my dear. I'll be there.

107
00:09:42,443 --> 00:09:45,242
I've invited the ladies
of the Law and Order League.

108
00:10:03,175 --> 00:10:07,478
All aboard for Dry Fork,
Apache Wells...

109
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,479
...Lee's Ferry and Lordsburg!

110
00:10:20,235 --> 00:10:22,136
- I'll take that, Dallas.
- Oh, thanks.

111
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,834
In you go, Dallas,
and a pleasant voyage.

112
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:39,826
- Here's your baggage, Doc.
- Thank you, thank you my friend.

113
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:42,794
Curley, my shingle.
Carry it with honor.

114
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,067
- I'll take it, Doctor.
- Oh no, no trouble at all.

115
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:47,303
No trouble at all.
I'll carry it on my lap.

116
00:10:47,377 --> 00:10:49,710
Here we go! Here we go, Reverend.

117
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:54,753
Mrs. Whitney, you're not going to let
your friend travel with that creature!

118
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:58,691
She's right, Lucy. And besides,
you're not well enough to travel.

119
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:02,423
It's only a few hours, Nancy.
I'm quite all right.

120
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:04,696
But you shouldn't travel a step
without a doctor.

121
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:07,206
There is a doctor, dear.
The driver told me.

122
00:11:07,408 --> 00:11:09,377
Doctor? Doc Boone?

123
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,872
Why, he couldn't doctor a horse!

124
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,387
Lucy darling, you must be very careful.
Take good care of yourself.

125
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:18,949
- Lady folks ride faces forward, please.
- There you go!

126
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,432
- Pleasant journey, Mrs. Mallory.
- Thank you. Good-bye!

127
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:43,320
Like an angel in the jungle.

128
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:47,599
- A very wild jungle.
- What are you doing, Hatfield?

129
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:49,467
Talking to yourself?

130
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,108
You wouldn't understand, cowboy.

131
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,651
You've never seen an angel.
Nor a gentlewoman.

132
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:03,329
Nor a great lady. I raise, gentlemen.

133
00:12:16,383 --> 00:12:18,545
Captain Sickels asks for you to deliver
this despatch in Lordsburg...

134
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:21,648
...the moment you arrive.
The telegraph line has been cut.

135
00:12:21,858 --> 00:12:24,384
We're going with you as far as
the noon station at Dry Fork.

136
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:27,160
There'll be a troop of Cavalry there,
and they'll take you on to Apache Wells.

137
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:30,396
From Apache Wells you'll have another
escort of soldiers into Lordsburg.

138
00:12:30,505 --> 00:12:32,872
You must warn your passengers that
they travel at their own risk.

139
00:12:32,975 --> 00:12:35,308
At their own risk?
Well, what's the trouble, Lieutenant?

140
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,176
Geronimo.

141
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:37,579
Geronimo? Well, then I ain't goin'...

142
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,742
Will you sit down?

143
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,150
Of course the Army has no authority
over you gentlemen.

144
00:12:41,322 --> 00:12:42,950
If you think it's unsafe
to make the trip...

145
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:44,584
This stage is going to Lordsburg.

146
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:46,423
If you think it ain't safe
to ride along with us...

147
00:12:46,497 --> 00:12:49,365
...I figure we can get there
without you soldier boys.

148
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:52,732
I have my orders, sir.
And I always obey orders.

149
00:12:57,247 --> 00:12:59,773
Did you all hear what
the Lieutenant said?

150
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:01,351
Yes, we heard.

151
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:03,749
Well me and Buck are taking
this coach through...

152
00:13:03,823 --> 00:13:07,226
...passengers or not. Now whoever
wants to get out, can get out.

153
00:13:08,464 --> 00:13:11,264
Courage, courage, Reverend.
Ladies first.

154
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,672
How 'bout you, Dallas?

155
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:17,443
What are they trying to do?
Scare somebody?

156
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:20,549
They got me in here, now let them
try to put me out.

157
00:13:20,783 --> 00:13:23,048
There are worse things than Apaches.

158
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:25,416
If you'll take my advice, ma'am...

159
00:13:25,491 --> 00:13:26,981
...you won't take this trip.

160
00:13:27,093 --> 00:13:29,791
My husband is with his troops
in Dry Fork.

161
00:13:29,997 --> 00:13:31,863
If he's in danger,
I want to be with him.

162
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:35,469
You see, brother, I have a wife
and five children...

163
00:13:35,539 --> 00:13:39,136
Then you're a man. By all the powers
that be, Reverend, you're a man.

164
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:44,214
- All right, folks.
- Marshall!

165
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:47,515
Make room for one more.

166
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:51,190
I'm offering my protection
to this lady.

167
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,028
I can shoot fairly straight
if there's need for it.

168
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:56,161
That's been proved
too many times, Hatfield.

169
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:58,765
All right, get in. We're late.

170
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:04,277
- May I trouble you to move over, sir?
- Oh yes, yes of course.

171
00:14:06,187 --> 00:14:07,587
Close the door.

172
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:09,620
Oh Curley, we...

173
00:14:09,692 --> 00:14:10,682
Get going, Buck!

174
00:14:11,162 --> 00:14:13,063
Bessie, Barney, Belle!

175
00:14:13,298 --> 00:14:15,028
Farewell, ladies!

176
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:16,865
Sweetheart, come on now, girl!

177
00:14:44,547 --> 00:14:46,448
- Room for another passenger?
- Sure is, Mr. Gatewood.

178
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:49,386
- Going to Lordsburg?
- Yes, I just got a telegram.

179
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,424
Had to stop to pack this bag...

180
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:37,855
If there's anything I don't like
it's driving a stagecoach...

181
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:39,661
...through Apache country.

182
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,827
Funny catching Gatewood
outside of town that way.

183
00:15:42,872 --> 00:15:46,206
I just took this job ten years ago
so I could make enough money...

184
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:48,438
...to marry my Mexican girl, Julietta...

185
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,345
...and I been workin' hard at it
ever since.

186
00:15:52,353 --> 00:15:54,254
- At marriage?
- Why certainly.

187
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,286
My wife's got more relatives
than anyone you ever did see.

188
00:15:57,795 --> 00:16:00,526
I bet I'm feedin'
half the state of Chihuahua.

189
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,001
Didn't it seem funny to you
about Gatewood?

190
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:07,509
Yeah, and then what do I get to eat
when I get home in Lordsburg?

191
00:16:07,576 --> 00:16:12,448
Nothin' but frijole beans, that's all.
Nothin' but beans, beans, beans!

192
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,627
Excuse me, ladies.
Close quarters.

193
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:23,022
Warm today.

194
00:16:23,736 --> 00:16:26,205
Your wife made it warm
for me, Gatewood.

195
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,132
She was chairman of
our farewell committee.

196
00:16:31,814 --> 00:16:34,215
Fine looking bunch of
soldier boys back there.

197
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,777
Always gives me great pride
in my country...

198
00:16:36,856 --> 00:16:39,758
...when I see such fine young men
in the U.S. Army.

199
00:16:40,595 --> 00:16:42,962
Anybody know where they're going?

200
00:16:43,098 --> 00:16:46,092
Brother, aren't you aware
of what's happened?

201
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:49,234
Happened? I don't follow you, Reverend.

202
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:51,706
I'm not a clergyman, I'm a...

203
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:54,477
My friend's a whisky drummer.

204
00:16:54,617 --> 00:16:56,677
We're all going to be scalped, Gatewood.

205
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:59,457
Massacred in one fell swoop.

206
00:16:59,658 --> 00:17:01,183
That's why the soldiers are with us.

207
00:17:01,294 --> 00:17:03,195
He's joking, of course.

208
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:06,598
Oh no, he's not. Oh dear no.
I wish he were.

209
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:09,070
It's that old Apache butcher...

210
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:10,641
...Geronimo.

211
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:14,473
Nice name for a butcher.

212
00:17:14,815 --> 00:17:17,980
He's jumped the reservation.
He's on the war path.

213
00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:21,989
Geronimo? Why weren't the passengers
notified? Why wasn't I told?

214
00:17:22,193 --> 00:17:24,527
We were told, Gatewood.

215
00:17:24,664 --> 00:17:25,756
Weren't you told...

216
00:17:25,832 --> 00:17:28,701
...when you got that message
from Lordsburg?

217
00:17:29,037 --> 00:17:31,872
Oh yes. Yes, of course.
I forgot.

218
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:53,504
Now, doggone it, they're bringing up
her grandfather...

219
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:56,944
...all the way from Mexico
to live with us.

220
00:17:57,548 --> 00:17:59,847
I can't figure out how
he got that message.

221
00:17:59,918 --> 00:18:02,150
- Who, her grandfather?
- No, Gatewood.

222
00:18:03,892 --> 00:18:05,758
He said he got a message.

223
00:18:06,729 --> 00:18:09,063
The telegraph line ain't workin'.

224
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:51,689
Hold it!

225
00:18:55,806 --> 00:18:58,139
Hey look, it's Ringo!

226
00:19:00,981 --> 00:19:03,212
- Hello, Kid.
- Hello, Curley.

227
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:07,011
Hi ya, Buck. How's your folks?

228
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,015
Oh, just fine Ringo...

229
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:11,028
...except my grandfather came up...
- Shut up!

230
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:14,991
Didn't expect to see you ridin' shotgun
on this run, Marshall.

231
00:19:15,336 --> 00:19:19,104
- Goin' to Lordsburg?
- I figured you'd be there by this time.

232
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,140
No.

233
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:21,943
Lame horse.

234
00:19:22,814 --> 00:19:25,340
Well, it looks like you've
got another passenger.

235
00:19:26,854 --> 00:19:29,016
I'll take the Winchester.

236
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,286
You may need me and
this Winchester, Curley.

237
00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:35,359
I saw a ranch house burnin' last night.

238
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:39,336
You don't understand, Kid.
You're under arrest.

239
00:19:52,928 --> 00:19:55,363
- Everything all right, Marshall?
- Everything's all right, Lieutenant.

240
00:19:55,398 --> 00:19:57,390
Hope I ain't crowdin' you folks none.

241
00:19:57,568 --> 00:19:59,264
The more the merrier.

242
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:24,207
Ain't Ringo a fine boy?

243
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:26,304
I think so.

244
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:29,981
You're just smarter than a trade rat.

245
00:20:30,053 --> 00:20:33,285
You knew all the time
that he was going to Lordsburg.

246
00:20:34,893 --> 00:20:37,557
Reckon what he meant,
he saw ranch houses burnin'?

247
00:20:38,632 --> 00:20:39,964
Apaches.

248
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,103
So you're the notorious Ringo Kid.

249
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,274
My friends just call me Ringo.

250
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,344
Nickname I had as a kid.

251
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:50,614
Right name's Henry.

252
00:20:51,453 --> 00:20:54,014
Seems to me I knew your family, Henry.

253
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:59,288
Didn't I fix your arm when you were...
oh, bucked off a horse?

254
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:01,663
- Are you Doc Boone?
- I certainly am.

255
00:21:03,171 --> 00:21:07,338
Let's see. I just been honorably
discharged from the Union Army...

256
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:09,475
...after the War of the Rebellion.

257
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:12,546
You mean the war for
the Southern Confederacy, sir.

258
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,153
I mean nothing of the kind, sir.

259
00:21:15,657 --> 00:21:18,219
That was my kid brother, broke his arm.

260
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:20,257
You did a good job, Doc.

261
00:21:20,331 --> 00:21:22,061
Even if you was drunk.

262
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:23,499
Thank you, son.

263
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,505
Professional compliments
are always pleasing.

264
00:21:26,507 --> 00:21:29,501
What happened to that boy,
whose arm I fixed?

265
00:21:31,682 --> 00:21:33,173
He was murdered.

266
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,516
Put out that cigar!

267
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,890
You're annoying this lady.

268
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:27,799
Excuse me, madam.

269
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:33,142
Being so partial to the weed myself,
I sometimes forget that...

270
00:22:33,211 --> 00:22:35,112
...it disagrees with others.

271
00:22:37,952 --> 00:22:40,787
A gentleman doesn't smoke
in the presence of a lady.

272
00:22:41,824 --> 00:22:45,957
Three weeks ago I took a bullet out of
a man who was shot by a gentleman.

273
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,062
The bullet was in his back!

274
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:51,264
- Do you mean to insinuate...
- Sit down, Mister.

275
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,405
The Doc don't mean no harm.

276
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:54,732
Be careful of old Bessie
up there, now.

277
00:24:05,088 --> 00:24:09,255
If it isn't my old friend
Sergeant Billy Pickett!

278
00:24:10,563 --> 00:24:12,464
- How are you, Billy?
- He's fine, Doctor!

279
00:24:12,532 --> 00:24:15,162
Mighty glad to see you!
Great heavens above!

280
00:24:15,237 --> 00:24:17,638
We didn't figure on no stagecoach
coming through.

281
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,369
With them Apaches raisin' Cain.

282
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:22,504
- I was just tellin' Billy to hitch up...
- Now wait a minute!

283
00:24:22,815 --> 00:24:24,750
Do you mean to say that there are
no troops at this station?

284
00:24:24,818 --> 00:24:26,787
Ain't no soldiers here,
but what you see.

285
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:29,826
But my husband, Captain Mallory,
I was told he was here.

286
00:24:29,893 --> 00:24:33,797
Well deary, got orders to drive
the soldiers to Apache Wells.

287
00:24:35,635 --> 00:24:38,606
- Well that means we gotta go back.
- I can't go back!

288
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,973
Now look here, driver, you started
this coach for Lordsburg...

289
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:42,909
...and it's your duty to get there!

290
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,846
And it's your duty, young man,
to come along with us!

291
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,887
It's my duty, Mr. Gatewood,
to obey orders. I'm sorry, sir.

292
00:24:49,624 --> 00:24:52,151
If the soldiers go back, Lieutenant,
that means we all have to go back?

293
00:24:52,328 --> 00:24:54,456
My orders are to return
from here immediately.

294
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:56,033
And I can't disobey those orders.

295
00:24:56,101 --> 00:24:58,161
I think we can get through
all right, Curley.

296
00:24:58,337 --> 00:25:01,740
Oh, now don't egg him on, Kid.
I'm drivin' this here outfit, and...

297
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,713
...well, if the soldiers go back,
so am I.

298
00:25:05,182 --> 00:25:06,775
I call this a desertion of duty!

299
00:25:06,884 --> 00:25:09,012
I'll report you to
your superior officer!

300
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:11,283
And if necessary,
I'll take the matter up at Washington.

301
00:25:11,357 --> 00:25:14,260
That's your privilege, sir.
But if you give us any trouble here...

302
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:16,127
...l'll have to put you under restraint.

303
00:25:16,699 --> 00:25:18,793
Now don't lose your temper.
Don't lose your temper.

304
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:21,863
I'll tell you how we'll settle it.
We'll take a vote. Inside, everybody.

305
00:25:21,941 --> 00:25:24,673
- Come on, Buck.
- Oh, Curley, I don't want to go.

306
00:25:28,885 --> 00:25:32,323
Now you girls set yourselves down,
and I'll get you something to eat.

307
00:25:32,557 --> 00:25:35,687
Now folks, if we push on, we can be
in Apache Wells by sundown.

308
00:25:35,762 --> 00:25:38,095
The soldiers there will give us
an escort as far as the ferry.

309
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:41,170
Then it's only a hoot an' a holler
into Lordsburg.

310
00:25:41,238 --> 00:25:43,639
We've got four men
who can handle firearms.

311
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,640
Five with you, Ringo.

312
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:48,078
Doc can shoot, if sober.

313
00:25:48,716 --> 00:25:52,176
I can shoot? I can shoot?!

314
00:25:52,756 --> 00:25:55,590
Now, Mrs. Mallory, I ain't
gonna put a lady in danger...

315
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,458
...without she votes for it.

316
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,196
I've traveled all the way here
from Virginia.

317
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:02,464
I'm determined to get to my husband.

318
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:05,131
I won't be separated any longer.

319
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:10,440
- What's your vote, mister?
- Where are your manners, Curley?

320
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:12,979
Ain't you gonna ask
the other lady first?

321
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,919
Well, what do you say?

322
00:26:23,637 --> 00:26:26,631
What difference does it make?
It doesn't matter.

323
00:26:28,344 --> 00:26:29,937
I vote that we go on.

324
00:26:30,113 --> 00:26:33,175
I demand it.
I'm standing on my legal rights.

325
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,381
What do you say, Hatfield?

326
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,631
- Lordsburg.
- Four.

327
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:48,103
- You, Doc?
- I'm not only a philosopher, sir.

328
00:26:48,743 --> 00:26:53,581
I'm a fatalist. Somewhere, sometime
there may be the right bullet...

329
00:26:53,818 --> 00:26:55,286
...or the wrong bottle...

330
00:26:55,354 --> 00:26:57,186
...waiting for Josiah Boone.

331
00:26:57,256 --> 00:26:59,817
- Why worry when or where?
- Yes or no?

332
00:27:00,194 --> 00:27:04,691
Having that philosophy, sir,
I've always courted danger.

333
00:27:05,035 --> 00:27:08,700
During the late war, when I had
the honor to serve the Union...

334
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:12,012
...under our great president,
Abraham Lincoln...

335
00:27:12,513 --> 00:27:15,746
...and General Phil Sheridan,
well sir...

336
00:27:15,985 --> 00:27:19,388
...I fought 'mid shock and shell
and cannon roar.

337
00:27:19,557 --> 00:27:20,991
Do you want to go back or not?

338
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,028
No.

339
00:27:22,396 --> 00:27:24,058
I want another drink.

340
00:27:26,535 --> 00:27:28,026
That's five.

341
00:27:28,204 --> 00:27:30,036
How about you, Mr. Hancock?

342
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:33,272
Peacock. I'd like to go on,
brother. I want to reach...

343
00:27:33,346 --> 00:27:35,941
...the bosom of my dear family,
in Kansas City, Kansas...

344
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:39,283
...as quickly as possible. But I may
never reach that bosom if we go on.

345
00:27:39,355 --> 00:27:41,882
So, under the circumstances,
you understand, brother...

346
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,326
...I think it best we go back
with the bosoms...

347
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,126
...I mean, the soldiers.

348
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:47,899
One against.

349
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:50,766
Well, Buck?
Buck says "aye", that's six.

350
00:27:50,907 --> 00:27:53,206
I'm voting your proxy, Kid,
and you go with me.

351
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,711
Ain't nothin' keepin' me out
of Lordsburg, Curley.

352
00:27:55,815 --> 00:27:59,844
There sure ain't. Well folks,
that settles it, we're goin' through.

353
00:27:59,921 --> 00:28:03,723
Sit down, folks, and eat your grub.
Come on Buck, we'll change them horses.

354
00:28:03,893 --> 00:28:06,796
- But Curley, ain't we gonna eat?
- You can eat later!

355
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:10,630
Here you go, folks.
Food's on the table, help yourselves.

356
00:28:11,605 --> 00:28:13,973
You've got a long ride ahead of you.

357
00:28:15,044 --> 00:28:17,276
You ain't drinkin' Billy?

358
00:28:17,515 --> 00:28:19,040
Sit down here, ma'am.

359
00:28:25,127 --> 00:28:26,186
Thanks.

360
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,475
May I find you another place,
Mrs. Mallory?

361
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:02,541
It's cooler by the window.

362
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:08,854
Thank you.

363
00:29:34,602 --> 00:29:37,003
Looks like I got the plague, don't it?

364
00:29:38,574 --> 00:29:40,873
- No... no it's not you.
- Well, I guess you can't...

365
00:29:40,944 --> 00:29:43,608
...break out of prison and into society
in the same week.

366
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,650
Please... please.

367
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:06,008
- You're ill, Mrs. Mallory.
- No, it's just that I...

368
00:30:07,787 --> 00:30:08,879
I'll be all right.

369
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,993
You've been very kind. Why?

370
00:30:14,697 --> 00:30:18,500
In the world I live in, one doesn't
often meet a lady, Mrs. Mallory.

371
00:30:19,805 --> 00:30:21,774
Have you ever been in Virginia?

372
00:30:22,008 --> 00:30:24,001
I was in your father's regiment.

373
00:30:27,685 --> 00:30:31,020
I should remember your name.
You're Mr. Hatfield.

374
00:30:31,357 --> 00:30:33,485
That's what I'm called, yes.

375
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:45,705
Why do you look at me like that?

376
00:30:45,846 --> 00:30:47,610
I'm just trying to remember.

377
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,682
Ain't I seen you
someplace before, ma'am?

378
00:30:50,821 --> 00:30:53,222
No, you haven't.

379
00:30:54,793 --> 00:30:56,955
I wish I had, though.

380
00:30:58,366 --> 00:30:59,959
I know you, I mean...

381
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:04,734
...I know who you are. I guess
everybody in the territory does.

382
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:08,408
Well, I used to be
a good cowhand, but...

383
00:31:09,783 --> 00:31:11,183
...things happen.

384
00:31:13,188 --> 00:31:14,850
Yeah, that's it.

385
00:31:15,693 --> 00:31:16,955
Things happen.

386
00:31:18,096 --> 00:31:20,395
So now they'll take you back to prison.

387
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:23,431
Not till I finish a job, in Lordsburg.

388
00:31:25,107 --> 00:31:27,770
But you can't.
You're going there as a prisoner.

389
00:31:31,283 --> 00:31:33,446
All aboard for Apache Wells, Lee's...

390
00:31:33,788 --> 00:31:36,257
Ready folks, the horses are changed.
We better get going.

391
00:31:36,324 --> 00:31:37,758
...and Lordsburg, maybe.

392
00:31:37,827 --> 00:31:39,591
All right get going, Ringo.

393
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:42,768
Mrs. Pickett, tell Billy
the buckboard is all ready.

394
00:31:42,835 --> 00:31:45,897
- Right, Marshall, we're ready.
- Come on, folks, let's go.

395
00:33:20,988 --> 00:33:22,718
- What did you say?
- Nothin'.

396
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:25,291
Well why don't you say somethin'?
A fella gets nervous...

397
00:33:25,361 --> 00:33:28,628
...sittin' here like a dummy, with
nothin' to think about but the Indians.

398
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,828
You say something, you've been
sittin' there all day talkin'...

399
00:33:30,903 --> 00:33:31,928
...without makin' any sense!

400
00:33:32,005 --> 00:33:33,997
All right, I'll say somethin'
that makes sense.

401
00:33:34,075 --> 00:33:36,067
If I was you, I'd let 'em shoot it out.

402
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:37,976
- Let who?
- Luke Plummer and the Kid.

403
00:33:38,047 --> 00:33:41,177
There'd be a lot more peace in
this territory if that Luke Plummer...

404
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,346
...was so full of lead
he couldn't hold his liquor!

405
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:45,984
I ain't sayin' I don't share
your sentiments, Buck.

406
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,086
- But you're a born fool.
- Oh, I know that.

407
00:33:48,163 --> 00:33:50,655
In the first place, Luke would kill
the Kid in a gun fight.

408
00:33:50,735 --> 00:33:52,396
In the second place,
if Luke did get shot...

409
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:55,066
...he's got two brothers
just as ornery as he is.

410
00:33:55,141 --> 00:33:57,804
No, the only safe place for Ringo
is in the pen.

411
00:33:58,313 --> 00:34:00,111
And I aim to get him there
in one piece.

412
00:34:00,182 --> 00:34:03,244
Well I'll be doggoned if I didn't
do you an injury, Curley.

413
00:34:03,421 --> 00:34:06,152
- I figured you were after the reward.
- Reward?

414
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:08,692
Why, the Kid's old man and me
was friends.

415
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:13,327
We used to punch cattle together.
Besides, I could use that $500 in gold.

416
00:34:20,213 --> 00:34:23,082
I can't get over the impertinence
of that young lieutenant.

417
00:34:23,152 --> 00:34:26,590
I'll make it warm for that shavetail!
I'll report him to Washington!

418
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:29,354
We pay taxes to the government
and what do we get?

419
00:34:29,428 --> 00:34:31,659
Not even protection from the Army!

420
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,064
I don't know what
the government is coming to.

421
00:34:36,138 --> 00:34:39,541
Instead of protecting businessmen,
it pokes its nose into business.

422
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,541
Why they're even talking now
about having bank examiners.

423
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:47,146
As if we bankers don't know
how to run our own banks!

424
00:34:47,957 --> 00:34:50,756
At home I actually have a letter
from a popinjay official...

425
00:34:50,828 --> 00:34:53,390
...saying they were going
to inspect my books!

426
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,162
I have a slogan that should be placed
on every newspaper in the country.

427
00:34:57,905 --> 00:35:02,106
America for Americans! The government
must not interfere with business!

428
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:05,944
Reduce taxes! Our national debt
is something shocking!

429
00:35:06,285 --> 00:35:08,277
Over one billion dollars a year!

430
00:35:09,123 --> 00:35:12,526
What this country needs is
a businessman for president.

431
00:35:12,628 --> 00:35:15,690
What this country needs is more fuddle.

432
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,833
What?

433
00:35:17,669 --> 00:35:18,728
Fuddle!

434
00:35:19,205 --> 00:35:20,696
You're drunk, sir!

435
00:35:21,008 --> 00:35:22,670
I'm happy, Gatewood.

436
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:49,842
How come you're taking this route?
It's gonna be cold up there.

437
00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:54,857
I'm using my head. Those beach-crowd
Apaches don't like snow.

438
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:14,224
Maybe you'd like to...
sit next to me.

439
00:36:14,725 --> 00:36:17,025
You could put your head on my shoulder.

440
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:20,497
No, thank you.

441
00:36:33,288 --> 00:36:35,348
How are you feeling, Mrs. Mallory?

442
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,586
Is there any water?

443
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:43,266
Driver, canteen please.

444
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:58,492
Just a minute, Mrs. Mallory.

445
00:37:20,494 --> 00:37:22,520
Haven't I seen this crest before?

446
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:25,825
Isn't this from Greenfield Manor?

447
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:29,331
I wouldn't know, Mrs. Mallory.

448
00:37:31,178 --> 00:37:32,908
I won this cup on a wager.

449
00:37:35,284 --> 00:37:37,014
How about the other lady?

450
00:37:46,502 --> 00:37:47,560
Thanks.

451
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,904
Sorry...

452
00:37:53,045 --> 00:37:54,775
...no silver cups.

453
00:37:55,716 --> 00:37:57,378
This is fine!

454
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:31,895
Please, Doctor.

455
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:39,596
Howdy, Chris, seven hours from
Dry Fork, pretty fast drivin', amigo!

456
00:40:39,772 --> 00:40:41,707
Get the folks a bite to eat,
while we change the horses.

457
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,209
We're pushing right on to Lordsburg.

458
00:40:43,278 --> 00:40:44,769
You come without soldiers?

459
00:40:44,913 --> 00:40:48,612
Oh, we weren't scared. We didn't see
one Apache, did we Curley?

460
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,615
- Where's the cavalry, Chris?
- Where's the soldiers?

461
00:40:51,691 --> 00:40:53,090
There ain't no soldiers.

462
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:55,160
Soldiers are gone!

463
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,692
Where's Captain Mallory?

464
00:40:57,767 --> 00:40:59,827
Where's my husband? Where is he?

465
00:41:00,537 --> 00:41:03,099
- You his wife, I think?
- Yes, where is he?

466
00:41:03,575 --> 00:41:05,806
- Did he go with his men?
- S, seora.

467
00:41:06,347 --> 00:41:08,009
A little, what you call, skirmish...

468
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:10,075
...with the Apaches last night.

469
00:41:10,253 --> 00:41:12,848
Soldiers take Captain Mallory
to Lordsburg.

470
00:41:13,491 --> 00:41:15,221
I think he get hurt, maybe.

471
00:41:16,529 --> 00:41:17,827
Badly?

472
00:41:19,634 --> 00:41:21,034
S, seora. I think so.

473
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:23,233
I think so.

474
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,721
I'm awfully sorry.
If there's anything I can...

475
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,787
I'm quite all right, thank you.

476
00:41:53,487 --> 00:41:55,479
Marshall, come here quickly!

477
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:40,686
Come on, Doc.

478
00:42:42,597 --> 00:42:43,723
Let's go, Doc.

479
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,843
A sick woman on our hands!

480
00:42:56,919 --> 00:42:58,216
That's all we needed!

481
00:42:59,089 --> 00:43:02,527
We're in a fine fix, my friends.
It's a fine country we're living in!

482
00:43:02,928 --> 00:43:05,592
The Army has no right to leave
a public place like this undefended.

483
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,966
It looks to me like the Army's
got its hands pretty full, mister.

484
00:43:13,778 --> 00:43:15,770
- Have you a wife?
- S, seora. I think...

485
00:43:15,848 --> 00:43:16,907
Call her.

486
00:43:18,286 --> 00:43:21,120
Ringo, go in the kitchen and get
some hot water. Lots of hot water.

487
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,749
- Please.
- Yes, ma'am.

488
00:43:39,151 --> 00:43:42,213
A fine member of the medical profession.

489
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:44,554
Drunken beast!

490
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,565
Give me coffee.

491
00:43:55,377 --> 00:43:56,309
Black coffee.

492
00:43:57,981 --> 00:43:59,142
Lots of it.

493
00:44:03,022 --> 00:44:04,422
More, more, more!

494
00:44:04,992 --> 00:44:06,620
Blacker, stronger.
Keep it comin', Curley!

495
00:44:06,695 --> 00:44:09,324
You'll have it comin' out
your ears in a minute.

496
00:44:09,766 --> 00:44:11,928
- Now drink it down, Doc.
- Get it down.

497
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,709
Isn't that drunken swine sober yet?

498
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:22,945
He's doing the best he can!

499
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,249
Well, hurry!

500
00:44:26,626 --> 00:44:28,527
- How do you feel?
- Fine.

501
00:44:32,134 --> 00:44:33,363
Thanks, again.

502
00:44:36,642 --> 00:44:38,201
Sit down here, Doc.

503
00:44:39,412 --> 00:44:42,076
Keep the fire going, Chris.
Plenty of hot water.

504
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,717
Savages!

505
00:44:48,593 --> 00:44:50,961
That's my wife, Yakima, my squaw.

506
00:44:51,097 --> 00:44:53,931
Yes, but she's... she's... savage!

507
00:44:54,603 --> 00:44:57,266
S, seor, she a little bit savage,
I think.

508
00:45:03,183 --> 00:45:05,914
Something funny about this.
That woman's an Apache.

509
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,355
Sure, she one of Geronimo's people.

510
00:45:08,591 --> 00:45:11,527
I think, maybe not so bad
to have Apache wife, eh?

511
00:45:11,595 --> 00:45:13,655
Apache don't bother me, I think.

512
00:45:28,723 --> 00:45:30,692
- All right, Doc?
- All right.

513
00:45:37,069 --> 00:45:38,468
All right, Dallas.

514
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:34,013
It's them vaqueros,
they've run away.

515
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,353
Yeah, with the spare horses.

516
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:07,959
Them coyotes give me
the creeps. That sounds...

517
00:48:08,204 --> 00:48:10,504
...well it sounds just like a baby.

518
00:48:53,776 --> 00:48:55,005
It's a baby!

519
00:48:58,349 --> 00:49:00,011
It's a little girl.

520
00:49:00,486 --> 00:49:02,010
It's a little girl.

521
00:49:02,156 --> 00:49:04,387
Well, I'll be doggoned!

522
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,153
Why didn't somebody tell me?

523
00:49:10,168 --> 00:49:12,000
How's Mrs. Mallory?

524
00:49:13,006 --> 00:49:14,804
She's going to be all right.

525
00:49:15,609 --> 00:49:17,601
Well, I'll be doggoned.

526
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:19,908
Did you know?

527
00:49:27,962 --> 00:49:29,658
Well, I'll be doggoned.

528
00:49:31,801 --> 00:49:33,167
Don't do that!

529
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:01,337
Come on, boys,
three cheers for old Doc Boone!

530
00:50:01,648 --> 00:50:03,048
- Hip hip...
- Quiet!

531
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,986
- Well we oughta be...
- Quiet!

532
00:50:08,225 --> 00:50:09,453
Mrs. Mallory.

533
00:50:44,682 --> 00:50:46,878
I know why you want
to go to Lordsburg.

534
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,578
I like you.

535
00:50:48,654 --> 00:50:51,124
I know your papa.
He was good friend of mine.

536
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,654
If you know who in Lordsburg,
you stay away, I think.

537
00:50:55,999 --> 00:50:59,164
- You mean Luke Plummer?
- Luke, lke and Hank.

538
00:50:59,238 --> 00:51:01,139
All there together. I saw them.

539
00:51:06,349 --> 00:51:08,945
- Sure of that, Chris?
- Sure, I can tell you the truth.

540
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,581
- I know.
- Thanks. That's all I wanted to know.

541
00:51:12,859 --> 00:51:14,384
You crazy if you go.

542
00:51:14,629 --> 00:51:16,154
I think you stay away, Kid.

543
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:18,357
Three against one is no good!

544
00:51:50,251 --> 00:51:52,584
Startin' to go too far, Ms. Dallas.

545
00:51:54,757 --> 00:51:57,592
Apaches like to sneak up
and pick off strays.

546
00:51:59,532 --> 00:52:03,095
You... visitin' in Lordsburg?

547
00:52:04,005 --> 00:52:07,808
No, I have friends there.
And maybe I can find work.

548
00:52:09,481 --> 00:52:12,713
Look, Kid, why don't you try
to escape? Why don't you get away?

549
00:52:12,785 --> 00:52:15,278
I aim to, in Lordsburg.

550
00:52:15,457 --> 00:52:18,792
Why Lordsburg? Why don't you make
for the border now?

551
00:52:19,796 --> 00:52:23,131
My father and brother were shot down
by the Plummer boys.

552
00:52:23,469 --> 00:52:26,804
Guess you don't know how it feels
to lose your own folks that way.

553
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,641
I lost mine when I was a kid.

554
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:35,309
There was a massacre
on Superstition Mountain.

555
00:52:36,656 --> 00:52:38,022
That's tough.

556
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,419
Especially on a girl.

557
00:52:41,898 --> 00:52:44,493
Well, you gotta live,
no matter what happens.

558
00:52:44,635 --> 00:52:46,035
Yeah, that's it.

559
00:52:49,343 --> 00:52:50,902
Look, Ms. Dallas.

560
00:52:51,479 --> 00:52:53,004
You got no folks.

561
00:52:54,084 --> 00:52:55,882
Neither have I, and well...

562
00:52:56,454 --> 00:52:58,923
...maybe I'm takin' a lot
for granted, but...

563
00:53:00,026 --> 00:53:03,225
...I watched you with that baby.
That other woman's baby.

564
00:53:04,399 --> 00:53:05,628
You looked...

565
00:53:07,204 --> 00:53:09,730
I still got a ranch across
the border...

566
00:53:10,176 --> 00:53:11,234
...and it's a nice place.

567
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:12,969
A real nice place.

568
00:53:13,547 --> 00:53:16,712
Trees, grass, water...

569
00:53:17,554 --> 00:53:19,546
There's a cabin, half-built.

570
00:53:21,226 --> 00:53:22,717
A man could live there.

571
00:53:24,297 --> 00:53:25,458
And a woman.

572
00:53:26,768 --> 00:53:27,997
Will you go?

573
00:53:29,405 --> 00:53:30,873
But you don't know me.

574
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:32,900
You don't know who I am.

575
00:53:33,712 --> 00:53:35,613
I know all I want to know.

576
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,948
Will you go?

577
00:53:42,993 --> 00:53:44,484
Don't talk like that!

578
00:53:48,268 --> 00:53:50,294
What are you doing out here, Kid?

579
00:53:53,476 --> 00:53:55,604
Stick close to the reservation.

580
00:54:07,431 --> 00:54:09,297
- What's wrong, Chris?
- My wife Yakima, she ran away!

581
00:54:09,368 --> 00:54:10,859
When I woke up she was gone!

582
00:54:10,937 --> 00:54:13,065
The way you come bustin' in here,
you'd think...

583
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,438
Excuse me, Kid.

584
00:54:15,176 --> 00:54:17,441
Come bustin' in here,
you'd think we were being attacked!

585
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:19,476
You can find another wife.

586
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:22,988
Sure I can find another wife.
But she take my rifle and my horse.

587
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:25,389
Oh, I never sell her.
I love her so much.

588
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:28,494
I beat her with a whip
and she never get tired.

589
00:54:28,998 --> 00:54:31,160
- Your wife?
- No, my horse.

590
00:54:31,669 --> 00:54:35,505
I can find another wife, easy yes.
But not a horse like that.

591
00:54:37,244 --> 00:54:39,578
I knew that woman was a thief, l...

592
00:54:43,087 --> 00:54:46,923
- What's the matter with you, Gatewood?
- My valise! Where's my valise?

593
00:54:46,993 --> 00:54:48,359
Which one of you's got it?

594
00:54:48,429 --> 00:54:50,591
Here it is, I was usin' it as a pillow.
I didn't think...

595
00:54:50,665 --> 00:54:53,534
I thought I told you to keep
your hands off my things!

596
00:54:58,043 --> 00:55:01,708
That squaw of yours'll find some Apaches
and bring 'em back here.

597
00:55:01,949 --> 00:55:04,283
My wife's people
don't bother me, I think.

598
00:55:04,487 --> 00:55:06,353
Well, they bother me, I think.

599
00:55:07,691 --> 00:55:09,489
Is this bar open?

600
00:55:09,862 --> 00:55:11,763
Sure, all the time, seor, s!

601
00:55:16,038 --> 00:55:17,438
Here you are, Doc.

602
00:55:22,415 --> 00:55:24,611
Well, what are we wasting time for?
Let's make a break for it.

603
00:55:24,685 --> 00:55:26,017
We've got a sick woman to think of.

604
00:55:26,087 --> 00:55:28,022
You want her to stay here
and be butchered with the rest of us?

605
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:30,685
Why don't you think of
somebody else for once in your...

606
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:33,664
Easy, easy! Keep it quiet, boys.
Quiet!

607
00:55:34,768 --> 00:55:37,101
We ain't been butchered yet!

608
00:55:37,338 --> 00:55:38,829
You're right.

609
00:55:39,107 --> 00:55:41,839
We'd better get going for Lordsburg
as soon as we can.

610
00:55:41,912 --> 00:55:43,972
It might be a good idea, Curley if...

611
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,878
...the Doc took a look
at the patient.

612
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,952
Yeah, and little Coyote.

613
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,190
You'll join me, Doctor?

614
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,929
No, thanks.

615
00:56:15,832 --> 00:56:17,197
Good morning.

616
00:56:18,435 --> 00:56:20,597
Well, you're looking pretty chipper.

617
00:56:26,247 --> 00:56:27,909
You're up early, Dallas.

618
00:56:33,091 --> 00:56:34,423
She didn't go to bed, Doctor.

619
00:56:35,128 --> 00:56:38,156
I'm afraid she sat up all night,
while I slept.

620
00:56:38,768 --> 00:56:41,101
Oh, I slept a lot in the chair.

621
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:48,448
Well, anyway it was nice
to stay awake and hold the baby.

622
00:56:49,851 --> 00:56:52,320
Well, we've got to get you
to Lordsburg, little Coyote.

623
00:56:52,421 --> 00:56:55,620
That's what the boys christened her
last night when she squalled.

624
00:56:55,693 --> 00:56:58,687
- Little Coyote. How do you feel?
- Fine, thanks.

625
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:00,394
A little tired.

626
00:57:01,803 --> 00:57:04,103
- Doctor, do you think my husband...
- Never mind him.

627
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:07,509
The best medicine he can have
is to see you two safe and sound.

628
00:57:07,579 --> 00:57:09,411
You just make up your mind
you're going to get there.

629
00:57:09,482 --> 00:57:11,508
- I have made up my mind.
- That's the stuff.

630
00:57:11,585 --> 00:57:13,417
- I am going to get there.
- You'll need strength...

631
00:57:13,488 --> 00:57:15,184
...so get all the rest you can.

632
00:57:15,257 --> 00:57:17,783
Dallas, do you suppose
you could fix up a little broth?

633
00:57:17,861 --> 00:57:19,420
- She has already.
- Good.

634
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:22,064
How 'bout making some coffee
for the boys?

635
00:57:24,572 --> 00:57:26,734
Now you get some sleep, Mrs. Mallory.

636
00:57:27,643 --> 00:57:29,509
Don't look so proud.

637
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:33,178
I've brought hundreds of those
little fellas into the world...

638
00:57:33,252 --> 00:57:35,050
...once upon a time.

639
00:57:35,622 --> 00:57:37,922
The new one was always the prettiest.

640
00:57:47,674 --> 00:57:49,506
Ringo asked me to marry him.

641
00:57:52,649 --> 00:57:54,675
Is that wrong for a girl like me?

642
00:57:55,654 --> 00:57:57,486
If a man and a woman
love each other...

643
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,185
...it's all right, ain't it Doc?

644
00:58:01,529 --> 00:58:03,430
You're going to be hurt, child.

645
00:58:05,335 --> 00:58:07,361
Worse than you've ever been hurt.

646
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:10,974
'Cause you know that boy's headed
back to prison.

647
00:58:12,346 --> 00:58:15,840
Besides, if you two go
into Lordsburg together...

648
00:58:17,187 --> 00:58:21,523
...he's going to know all about you.

649
00:58:27,938 --> 00:58:30,100
He's not going into Lordsburg.

650
00:58:32,912 --> 00:58:35,575
All I want is for you
to tell me it's all right.

651
00:58:35,883 --> 00:58:39,719
Gosh, child, who am I to tell you
what's right or wrong?

652
00:58:41,859 --> 00:58:43,156
All right.

653
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:46,524
Go ahead.
Do it if you can.

654
00:58:49,404 --> 00:58:50,564
Good luck.

655
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:52,937
Thanks, Doc.

656
00:59:04,361 --> 00:59:05,761
Both doing nicely.

657
00:59:06,297 --> 00:59:08,289
She's a real soldier's wife,
that young lady.

658
00:59:08,367 --> 00:59:10,029
Good, good, then we can
leave immediately!

659
00:59:10,103 --> 00:59:13,940
Well, not for a day or so,
if you want my professional advice.

660
00:59:14,043 --> 00:59:16,604
What do you mean a day?
Stay another day? Why?

661
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,045
Where were you when
the stork came last night, Gatewood?

662
00:59:20,452 --> 00:59:24,447
I refuse to allow Mrs. Mallory to travel
till she and the child are out of danger.

663
00:59:24,626 --> 00:59:27,721
What do you mean, danger?
Aren't we in worse danger here?

664
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,057
I don't wish to intrude,
but I've had five children.

665
00:59:31,136 --> 00:59:32,729
I mean, my dear wife has...

666
00:59:33,005 --> 00:59:36,636
...and much as I dislike discussing it
in this hour of our trial...

667
00:59:36,978 --> 00:59:39,073
...I believe the Doctor is right.

668
00:59:39,482 --> 00:59:40,677
Spoken like a man, Reverend.

669
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:44,085
I say we ought to leave here before the
Apaches find us! That's common sense.

670
00:59:44,156 --> 00:59:46,092
I wish you were
ten years younger, Gatewood!

671
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,491
Don't let my white hair stop you...

672
00:59:49,932 --> 00:59:52,925
- Now Curley, I haven't said a word...
- Will you shut up?!

673
00:59:53,304 --> 00:59:55,500
If we argue this thing out right,
we can get somewhere.

674
00:59:55,574 --> 00:59:57,907
Let's all sit down and talk sensible.

675
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,241
Come on, Buck, sit down.

676
01:00:04,121 --> 01:00:07,559
There's a young woman in the kitchen
making coffee. She needs help.

677
01:00:10,864 --> 01:00:12,093
Thanks, Doc.

678
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,007
How old were you
when you went to the pen?

679
01:00:19,211 --> 01:00:21,875
Oh, I was goin' on 17.

680
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:38,571
Mornin' ma'am.

681
01:00:39,543 --> 01:00:40,703
Morning.

682
01:00:44,517 --> 01:00:45,644
I...

683
01:00:46,386 --> 01:00:48,355
...lied awake most of the night...

684
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:52,526
...wonderin' what you'd have said
if Curley hadn't busted in.

685
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,930
Guess you was up kinda late, too.

686
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:59,703
I could hear you movin' around.

687
01:01:01,877 --> 01:01:04,369
You didn't answer
what I asked you last night.

688
01:01:06,552 --> 01:01:08,987
Look, Kid, why don't you try to escape?

689
01:01:09,656 --> 01:01:12,354
There's a horse out there in the corral.
Curley won't go after you...

690
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,431
...because he can't leave the passengers
in a fix like this.

691
01:01:15,566 --> 01:01:17,228
I gotta go to Lordsburg.

692
01:01:18,169 --> 01:01:20,833
Why don't you go to my ranch,
and wait for me?

693
01:01:21,575 --> 01:01:24,444
Wait for a dead man.
You haven't got a chance.

694
01:01:25,414 --> 01:01:27,076
It was three against one
when the Plummers swore...

695
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,916
...that you killed their foreman,
and got you sent up.

696
01:01:29,988 --> 01:01:32,014
It'll be three against one
in Lordsburg.

697
01:01:32,091 --> 01:01:35,085
Well, there's some things a man
just can't run away from.

698
01:01:36,932 --> 01:01:40,665
How can you talk about your life and
my life when you're throwing them away?

699
01:01:40,938 --> 01:01:42,167
Yeah, mine too.

700
01:01:42,274 --> 01:01:44,766
That's what you're throwin' away
if you go to Lordsburg.

701
01:01:45,511 --> 01:01:47,413
What do you want me to do?

702
01:01:48,483 --> 01:01:51,943
Would it make us any happier
if Luke Plummer was dead?

703
01:01:52,289 --> 01:01:54,258
One of his brothers would be
after you with a gun.

704
01:01:54,325 --> 01:01:55,793
We'd never be safe.

705
01:01:56,396 --> 01:01:58,228
I don't want that kinda life, Ringo.

706
01:01:58,299 --> 01:02:00,495
Well, I don't see what else I can do.

707
01:02:00,969 --> 01:02:02,597
Go now, get away.

708
01:02:03,139 --> 01:02:05,473
Forget Lordsburg.
Forget the Plummers!

709
01:02:05,644 --> 01:02:07,840
Make for the border
and I'll come to you.

710
01:02:07,913 --> 01:02:09,279
- Do you mean that?
- Yes, I do!

711
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:11,250
Will you go with me, Dallas?

712
01:02:12,321 --> 01:02:14,813
I can't leave Mrs. Mallory
and the baby.

713
01:02:16,193 --> 01:02:18,822
I'll come to you from Lordsburg,
I swear it.

714
01:02:19,097 --> 01:02:22,000
- Well, I oughta have a rifle and some...
- I've got one!

715
01:02:22,336 --> 01:02:25,671
Right here. I got it last night,
when they were all asleep.

716
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,340
You mean you thought of this last night?

717
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:29,903
Yeah, don't ask anymore questions.
Not now.

718
01:02:31,684 --> 01:02:35,851
There ain't no Apaches behind us.
We can still go back to Tonto.

719
01:02:36,024 --> 01:02:39,655
- No, I insist we go on to Lordsburg.
- What do you think, Chris?

720
01:02:40,364 --> 01:02:44,428
Geronimo between here and Lordsburg,
with my horse, I think.

721
01:02:51,716 --> 01:02:55,711
Quiet, Doc. This is
a serious matter, ain't it?

722
01:02:55,988 --> 01:03:01,054
My dear Buck, if I have only one hour
to live, I'm going to enjoy myself!

723
01:03:02,064 --> 01:03:04,660
Doctor, I don't begrudge you
my samples, but l...

724
01:03:04,736 --> 01:03:08,606
Now, you hush, I stood enough of you.
Now this is a serious problem...

725
01:03:08,742 --> 01:03:11,338
...and I'm the only one that's
talking sense. Now Curley...

726
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:14,406
...if we can get across that ferry,
we'll be all right.

727
01:03:15,018 --> 01:03:19,354
The question is, what are we gonna do
about the lady and her baby?

728
01:03:19,425 --> 01:03:21,291
Doctor Boone has
settled that for us, sir.

729
01:03:21,628 --> 01:03:24,531
And I demand respect for
his professional opinion!

730
01:03:54,647 --> 01:03:58,244
Ringo, don't stop! Go on, go on!
Keep riding!

731
01:04:00,889 --> 01:04:02,687
Ringo, go on! Go on!

732
01:04:10,505 --> 01:04:13,236
You don't need them, Curley.
I ain't gonna run away.

733
01:04:13,309 --> 01:04:16,041
- I'll say you ain't!
- Look at them hills.

734
01:04:30,169 --> 01:04:32,536
- Apaches.
- War signals.

735
01:05:11,266 --> 01:05:16,206
Why don't you take the cuffs off
the Kid? He's mighty handy with a gun.

736
01:05:16,274 --> 01:05:18,937
You drive them horses,
I'll take care of the Kid!

737
01:05:19,613 --> 01:05:21,605
Can't you drive any faster?

738
01:05:22,283 --> 01:05:23,751
Thick-headed lout!

739
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,811
We've got to make that ferry!

740
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:28,258
A man works all his life
to get hold of some money...

741
01:05:28,359 --> 01:05:31,956
...so that he can enjoy life,
and has to run into a trap like this!

742
01:05:32,031 --> 01:05:34,194
Trap, brother?
You mean the Apaches?

743
01:05:34,269 --> 01:05:35,566
There's been no sign of them.

744
01:05:35,638 --> 01:05:37,607
You don't see any sign of them.

745
01:05:37,841 --> 01:05:39,571
They strike like rattlesnakes.

746
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,636
If you hadn't insisted
on waiting for her...

747
01:05:41,847 --> 01:05:44,510
...we'd have been past the ferry
by this time!

748
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:46,951
You talk too much, Gatewood.

749
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:49,484
Your threats don't faze me, Hatfield!

750
01:05:49,659 --> 01:05:51,993
You're nothing but a tinhorn gambler!

751
01:05:52,497 --> 01:05:54,056
How would you like
to get out and walk?

752
01:05:54,467 --> 01:05:56,493
You can't put me out of
a public conveyance!

753
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:59,302
Now, now, gentlemen!
Gentlemen!

754
01:05:59,842 --> 01:06:03,837
Take it easy, Gatewood. We may need
that fight before we get to the ferry.

755
01:06:04,048 --> 01:06:06,280
You wouldn't be much good
in a fight, you jailbird!

756
01:06:06,352 --> 01:06:08,685
Oh, leave the Kid alone.
He's handcuffed!

757
01:06:09,491 --> 01:06:10,981
Gentlemen, please...

758
01:06:12,028 --> 01:06:14,623
...let's not forget the ladies.
Bless them.

759
01:06:15,867 --> 01:06:19,305
Let's have a little Christian charity
one for the other.

760
01:06:33,561 --> 01:06:35,655
Well, folks, we're coming into
Lee's Ferry now!

761
01:06:35,731 --> 01:06:37,723
Lordsburg, next stop!

762
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,926
Curley, look! Look at the ferry!

763
01:07:01,371 --> 01:07:03,101
It's burnt too!

764
01:07:05,444 --> 01:07:07,777
Hatfield, stand guard over there.

765
01:07:08,014 --> 01:07:10,177
Where's the Army?
What are the soldiers doing?

766
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:11,877
Curley, what can I do?

767
01:07:13,123 --> 01:07:15,719
I need you. Will you give me your word
you won't try to escape again?

768
01:07:15,794 --> 01:07:17,990
I'll give you my word,
till Lordsburg.

769
01:07:18,131 --> 01:07:19,690
Get in the coach with them women!

770
01:07:19,767 --> 01:07:21,668
- I gave my word.
- Ringo, don't!

771
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:26,299
Buck, drive into the river
up to the hubs!

772
01:08:08,576 --> 01:08:11,411
Take your suspenders
and crosstie them wheels.

773
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:17,018
Sorry about the saddle, Kid.

774
01:08:18,992 --> 01:08:20,221
- Ready, Kid?
- All set!

775
01:08:20,294 --> 01:08:23,527
- Ready Buck?
- All ready, Curley. All aboard!

776
01:08:26,905 --> 01:08:29,568
Just sit quiet, folks,
we'll be all right!

777
01:09:09,972 --> 01:09:12,635
"All aboard for Lordsburg,
Lordsburg..."

778
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:19,141
You think I oughta charge
Mrs. Mallory's baby half fare?

779
01:09:52,371 --> 01:09:54,364
Well, we'll soon be in Lordsburg.

780
01:09:55,376 --> 01:09:58,870
Sorry I flew off the handle, Hatfield.
My apologies, Doctor.

781
01:09:59,015 --> 01:10:00,677
No hard feelings, I hope.

782
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:05,850
All in all, it's been an exciting,
a very interesting trip, has it not?

783
01:10:07,595 --> 01:10:10,657
- Now that the danger's past, Mr...
...Peacock.

784
01:10:11,768 --> 01:10:15,433
Ladies and gentlemen, since it's most
unlikely that we'll ever have...

785
01:10:15,573 --> 01:10:18,237
...the pleasure of
meeting again socially...

786
01:10:18,478 --> 01:10:20,413
...l'd like to propose a toast.

787
01:10:29,062 --> 01:10:31,122
- Your health.
- Thank you, sir.

788
01:12:14,292 --> 01:12:16,284
I warned you about this danger!

789
01:12:17,631 --> 01:12:20,294
Will you shut up?!
I've got a patient here!

790
01:12:23,974 --> 01:12:25,806
Will you shut up?!

791
01:14:52,339 --> 01:14:54,672
The leader, Kid!
Get the leader!

792
01:15:47,592 --> 01:15:50,255
Curley, more ammunition!

793
01:16:43,646 --> 01:16:45,046
Do you hear it?

794
01:16:46,851 --> 01:16:48,513
Do you hear it?

795
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:53,688
It's a bugle!
They're blowing the charge!

796
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:36,084
If you see Judge Ringfield...

797
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:40,263
...tell him his son...

798
01:18:35,954 --> 01:18:39,084
- Thank heaven you're safe, Lucy!
- Where's Richard? Is he all right?

799
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:40,752
Oh, he's all right.
Don't you worry.

800
01:18:40,829 --> 01:18:43,458
- It isn't a bad wound.
- We'll take you to him immediately.

801
01:18:43,532 --> 01:18:45,194
Where's the baby, dear?

802
01:18:56,486 --> 01:18:57,953
I'll take the baby.

803
01:19:13,813 --> 01:19:16,181
If there's ever anything I can do for...

804
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:19,118
I know.

805
01:20:12,204 --> 01:20:13,695
It's the Ringo Kid!

806
01:20:24,223 --> 01:20:26,089
Aces and eights.

807
01:20:26,994 --> 01:20:28,553
Dead man's hand, Luke.

808
01:20:31,267 --> 01:20:33,930
- Ringo Kid's in town.
- Yeah, drivin' the stage!

809
01:21:01,448 --> 01:21:02,676
Cash in.

810
01:22:12,057 --> 01:22:13,616
Good-bye, Ms. Dallas.

811
01:22:13,927 --> 01:22:17,421
If you ever come to Kansas City,
Kansas, I want you to come to see us.

812
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:19,793
- Well thanks, Mr...
- Peacock.

813
01:22:43,941 --> 01:22:46,502
Hello, Buck. You got through all right!

814
01:22:50,184 --> 01:22:52,483
Here you are Doctor,
will you sign this?

815
01:22:54,624 --> 01:22:56,456
- Lordsburg.
- Thank you.

816
01:23:06,108 --> 01:23:08,943
Curley, how long will they give me
for breakin' out?

817
01:23:09,013 --> 01:23:10,879
Oh, about another year.

818
01:23:11,416 --> 01:23:12,714
You know where my ranch is?

819
01:23:13,454 --> 01:23:14,113
Yeah.

820
01:23:14,688 --> 01:23:17,386
Will you see that
she gets there all right?

821
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,534
This is no town for a girl like her.

822
01:23:26,407 --> 01:23:27,636
Will you do it?

823
01:23:29,311 --> 01:23:31,007
- Sure.
- Thanks.

824
01:23:31,114 --> 01:23:34,051
How are you, Marshall? Get my man
through all right?

825
01:23:34,352 --> 01:23:36,822
- I don't need them.
- Lf you don't want to lose...

826
01:23:36,890 --> 01:23:38,950
...your prisoner, Sheriff, you'd better
take care of him yourself!

827
01:23:39,027 --> 01:23:42,556
- What's your name, mister?
- Gatewood! Elsworth H. Gatewood!

828
01:23:43,734 --> 01:23:46,966
You didn't think they'd have
the telegraph wires fixed, did you?

829
01:24:22,094 --> 01:24:24,461
Can I meet you back here
in ten minutes?

830
01:24:25,733 --> 01:24:29,171
I gave you my word, Curley.
I ain't goin' back on it now.

831
01:24:33,779 --> 01:24:35,178
No ammunition.

832
01:24:37,651 --> 01:24:39,210
I lied to you, Curley.

833
01:24:42,125 --> 01:24:43,525
I got three left.

834
01:25:34,707 --> 01:25:36,107
Good night, Kid.

835
01:25:38,446 --> 01:25:40,244
- Is this where you live?
- No.

836
01:25:41,618 --> 01:25:43,450
I gotta know where you live, don't I?

837
01:25:43,521 --> 01:25:45,513
No, don't come any further.

838
01:25:46,926 --> 01:25:51,262
It's all been a crazy dream.
I've been out of my mind, just hoping.

839
01:25:52,602 --> 01:25:54,161
Say good-bye here, Kid.

840
01:25:54,805 --> 01:25:56,967
We ain't never gonna say good-bye.

841
01:26:50,658 --> 01:26:52,217
Could I have that?

842
01:27:31,422 --> 01:27:33,118
Give me the shotgun.

843
01:27:54,124 --> 01:27:56,116
Luke, please don't!

844
01:28:56,722 --> 01:28:59,887
Well, Kid I... I told you
not to follow me.

845
01:29:24,131 --> 01:29:26,431
I asked you to marry me, didn't I?

846
01:29:31,476 --> 01:29:33,843
I'll never forget you asked me, Kid.

847
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:37,616
That's somethin'.

848
01:29:40,256 --> 01:29:41,485
Wait here.

849
01:29:53,177 --> 01:29:57,809
Ringo said he'll be passing this way
in... six or seven minutes.

850
01:30:02,625 --> 01:30:03,854
Come on!

851
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:08,196
I'll take that shotgun, Luke.

852
01:30:08,734 --> 01:30:12,035
You'll take it in the belly,
if you don't get out of my way.

853
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:17,036
I'll have you indicted for murder
if you step outside with that shotgun.

854
01:30:27,864 --> 01:30:29,856
We'll attend to you later.

855
01:30:43,956 --> 01:30:46,084
Don't ever let me do that again.

856
01:30:57,711 --> 01:31:02,207
Billy, kill that story about the
Republican Convention in Chicago...

857
01:31:02,385 --> 01:31:03,852
...and take this down:

858
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,584
"The Ringo Kid
was killed on Main Street...

859
01:31:06,658 --> 01:31:10,653
"...in Lordsburg tonight! And among
the additional dead were..."

860
01:31:10,731 --> 01:31:13,395
- I'll leave that blank for a spell.
- I didn't hear any shootin', Ed.

861
01:31:13,469 --> 01:31:15,461
You will, Billy. You will.

862
01:31:27,457 --> 01:31:29,790
Hank missed him, at four feet!

863
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:11,076
Ready, Kid?

864
01:34:16,587 --> 01:34:18,112
Thanks, Curley.

865
01:34:25,034 --> 01:34:28,335
Curley's going to see that you get
to my place across the border.

866
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:38,982
Good-bye, Dallas.

867
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:44,457
Maybe you'd like to ride
a ways with the Kid.

868
01:34:44,631 --> 01:34:45,860
Please.

869
01:35:16,314 --> 01:35:17,680
Well...

870
01:35:18,083 --> 01:35:21,145
...they're saved from
the blessings of civilization.

871
01:35:30,369 --> 01:35:32,497
I'll buy you a drink.

872
01:35:34,375 --> 01:35:35,604
Just one.
