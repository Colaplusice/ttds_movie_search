It was funny, huh?

13
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,639
Yes, but I have to pee.

14
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,831
That'll teach you to excite yourself like this.

15
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,508
Stop somewhere if you can.

16
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,028
Honey, you're not at school.
Don't bother poor Elly.

17
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,913
It does not bother me.
I take her to the toilet.

18
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,115
Shall I take this?

19
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,197
- Didn't you tell the others?
- What?

20
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,356
She was there.

21
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,676
I didn't know it myself until last night.

22
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,758
She doesn't even take too much room.

23
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,072
- You okay?
- Yes, thank you.

24
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,151
She's a nice woman.

25
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,033
Wait one day.
and They'll all fall in love with her.

26
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,309
Forget it, I'll do it.

27
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,949
But no, I'm used to.

28
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,116
Peyman!

29
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,713
You drive too fast.

30
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,911
- You drive too slow Amir!
- It's dangerous!

31
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,989
Amir, is there something in the air?

32
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,031
- What?
- That means you don't know?

33
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,514
I swear, I don't know anything.

34
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,393
Sepideh did not tell you
why she brought her?

35
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,157
Not at all.

36
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,910
You must promise me not to say anything
when we are together.

37
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,554
Seriously, Ahmad,
it's a good girl.

38
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,193
You really think so?

39
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,628
She will turn your life upside down.

40
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,793
You have seen this all in just 10 minutes?

41
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,957
Sure. You can see it right away.
Not true, Naazy?

42
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,276
It is natural.

43
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,518
Already three votes.

44
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,188
I said she was kind
nothing more.

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,949
Wait until tomorrow, none of you will dislike her.

46
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,276
Don't you worry about it. Let them do what they like.

47
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,631
If you find any other girl like this, keep her for me.

48
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,195
Could someone slap his head for me please?

49
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,511
Manoochehr!

50
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,273
Did you see this, Ahmad?

51
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,356
Well done!

52
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,959
You deserved it.

53
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,116
Oh, really?

54
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,553
Sepideh, does this girl know
that Ahmad was married before?

55
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,235
I don't know.

56
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,953
And that she forced him to divorce her?

57
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,710
Well laugh a little.

58
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,830
Stop, Peyman!

59
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,075
What's her name again? Miss Elly!

60
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,031
-Miss Elly!
-Peyman ...

61
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,991
Elly!

62
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,394
Stop!

63
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,718
You're going to embarrass her, stop!

64
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,550
Here is the charcoal samovar.

65
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,957
Do you know how many years i haven't drunk
this kinda tea! Poor me!

66
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,799
Ahmad, how did you do in 
Germany?

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,638
I lost my grip!

68
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,390
That's why
your german wife left you.

69
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,673
She told the judge:

70
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,078
"Achtung! Pachtung" This man is mad! "

71
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,190
Peyman!

72
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,630
Am i lying?

73
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,039
Amir could you help me?

74
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,036
I'm going.

75
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,793
So what?

76
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,593
It's not you that I called ...

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,513
- Was there a problem?
- Not at all

78
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,757
You know, they are teasing and kidding a lot.
Please don't get anything wrong.

79
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,830
Is that all?

80
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,238
Builds up the group.
Enjoy a few of these three days.

81
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,919
- Three days?
- Of course!

82
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,874
Madam ...

83
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,071
You see I was right
for the address.

84
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,635
For once it's me
that's wrong ...

85
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,638
Good morning.
Could you hand me the key to the villa?

86
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,276
- The Villa in the forest?
- The same as last year.

87
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,311
Bahri?

88
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,397
You were all together?

89
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,352
Yes, in college.

90
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,959
My sister Naazy.
Here Elly.

91
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,309
We already met.

92
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,988
Really? Sure ...

93
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,918
- Is it here?
- No, the key is here.

94
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,637
Accompany them to the villa.

95
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,116
We know the path.
We just need the key.

96
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,594
How are you?

97
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,752
Very well, thank you.

98
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,155
Don't forget about tomorrow evening.

99
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,112
- What?
- To leave earlier.

100
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,799
Because the owner arrives in the afternoon
from Tehran.

101
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,715
so you have to leave in the evening.

102
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,353
But we want to stay three days.

103
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,993
I already told one of on the phone.

104
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,519
It was me.

105
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,949
So we can't do anything about it?

106
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,037
For us, it wouldn't be a problem.

107
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,559
But it is the owner.

108
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,432
He did not know
we wanted to stay for 3 days?

109
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,631
We already told you on the phone.

110
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,632
I thought you had all provided for!

111
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,959
Everything was full. I took it
thinking that we could find something else.

112
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,958
Something else?
At this time of year? That's impossible.

113
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,593
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,028
It's not your fault madam.

115
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,958
Why didn't you tell me?

116
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,674
If i said it, we weren't here now.

117
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,555
It's okay.

118
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,796
We will find some other place.

119
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,556
At the phone, you didn't tell me that there is no chance.

120
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,510
But if ...

121
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,073
Can't you do anything?

122
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,429
But what?

123
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,950
If it was just us, we would find
some place to camped.

124
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,039
But we have guests with us,
a pair of newlyweds.

125
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,555
May God bless.

126
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,719
The groom is from Germany.
It's something like a honeymoon.

127
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,399
What about the villa of Mr.Mahmoudi?

128
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,828
That is taken.

129
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,519
We would go anywhere.

130
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,915
- And the one at the beach?
- That of Sadeghian?

131
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,119
- It dons' have any good windows or doors.
- you will be very cold at night.

132
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,070
And it is dirty.

133
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,918
We could clean it. Can we see the place?

134
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,348
Go get the key from your uncle.

135
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,073
Thank you very much.

136
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,719
What a beautiful sea!

137
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,399
What else, my mother?

138
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,709
Arash.

139
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,360
Are you sure it's the right key?

140
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,271
Attention don't hurt yourself.
Here we go!

141
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,755
Okay, Ahmad! It's open.

142
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,959
How did you get in, you?

143
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,032
Be careful not to fall.

144
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,199
How filthy!

145
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,068
Be Careful!

146
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,548
Wow it's so huge.

147
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,274
Be careful there's glass on the floor.

148
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,278
The air conditioning works.

149
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,553
Where are the toilets?

150
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,315
It has no locks. Will you watch?

151
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,313
If you use the toilet,
they won't take it back!

152
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,668
Very funny ...

153
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,797
We will spend our time
to do the housework. Careful!

154
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,716
Do not worry!

155
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,760
Hey little boy, are there gas containers here?

156
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,032
- With a vacuum cleaner, This would go faster.
- You go sit down.

157
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,957
Peyman, It will be cold at night.

158
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,435
Just cover the windows with something.

159
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,358
Wait, you're not alone.

160
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,799
I can make a suggestion?

161
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,709
- Tonight ...
- But it is good here!

162
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,717
Just let me say sonething?

163
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,759
Go ..

164
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,471
We go into the other house tonight
and come back here tomorrow.

165
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,274
We have to moved again then tomorrow!

166
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,710
The toilets are not intimate
but they work!

167
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,791
This is crucial!

168
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,592
It's beautiful here.

169
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,755
Beautiful.

170
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,834
We can't spend 
three days just thinking what to do!

171
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,316
- Now what?
- We vote.

172
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,793
Elly, what do you say?

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,353
I take care of the cleaning.

174
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,118
And you, Shohreh?

175
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,552
I propose
we go look elsewhere.

176
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,830
A vote against.
And you, Naazy?

177
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,189
I am the voice of my master.

178
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,756
Then her master?

179
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,989
We should stay.

180
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,635
And you, Peyman?

181
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,990
I say no,
as my master.

182
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,189
You're stupid!

183
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,756
Two votes against.

184
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,076
Two against five, we stay!

185
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,918
And me, my vote
nobody cares ...

186
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,515
Oh my! 

187
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,234
- Where are you going?
- I get a broom.

188
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,873
Fetch the luggage?

189
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,957
Lets clean up first.

190
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,991
Once we start it will take a while.

191
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,435
Sepideh?

192
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,229
Do you have the keys?

193
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,715
- Hey boy what is your name?
- Omid.

194
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,315
Omid, are there any shops
around here?

195
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,511
- What do you need Ahmad?
- Cigarettes.

196
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,709
I'll handle this.

197
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,388
Thank you.
Put it down, I'll take it.

198
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,351
Arash!

199
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,630
Come in, darling. You're soaked!

200
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,876
Peyman, call your son.

201
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,476
I will spend the whole weekend
looking after him.

202
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,557
Relax! We came
with the whole band.

203
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,469
I can't expect from everyone
not to go  to the sea because of our son.

204
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,599
Come, my darling.

205
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,874
Peyman, look if you find
the water heater.

206
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,308
Isn't it inside?

207
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,752
-No
-Then we have a problem

208
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,514
Cutie!

209
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,311
Yes? What's up?

210
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,989
So?

211
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,277
Sorry

212
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,113
- You scared me.
- Sorry!

213
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,869
I'll throw it away.

214
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,913
- Does it fit through?
- Yes, i think so.

215
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,797
Up.

216
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,158
- It doesn't fit. Wait.
- No, it's locked.

217
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,828
Give me that.

218
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,156
No it doesn't work!

219
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,032
Bend it a little.

220
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,118
You see, it worked!

221
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,154
I come and help.

222
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,798
Wait, you'll cut yourself!

223
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,111
Be careful not to cut yourself.

224
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,917
I'm here, Morvarid.

225
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,549
Sepideh!

226
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,595
Who sleeps where?

227
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,189
Who cares. We do as we can.

228
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,517
Women in the rooms,
and husbands in the living-room.

229
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,233
I am not separating from my wife.

230
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,759
Then you both in the living room.

231
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,030
- Shohreh?
- Yes?

232
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,196
I'm coming.

233
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,035
We will spend a hell of a night!

234
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,753
We'll dance to keep warm.

235
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,793
And those who can not dance?

236
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,274
We'll teach you.

237
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,953
Go get her!

238
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,438
- What?
- Go ahead., Run!

239
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,749
Don't let the opportunity pass!

240
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,996
It won't look good!

241
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,113
Ok leave me. I'll go.

242
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,755
Arash!

243
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,518
Get out of the water, quick!

244
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,510
Go see in the kitchen.

245
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,154
Well, Ahmad, your smokes.

246
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,513
Come back here! Hurry!

247
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,994
Go get him.

248
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,156
I said come here, you rogue!

249
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,632
You're all wet!

250
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,669
Look at that!

251
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,074
Elly!

252
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,958
- Looking for the lady?
- Yes.

253
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,639
She went to phone.

254
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,558
There 's no mobile phone connection here.

255
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,592
Stop screaming.
Hurry.

256
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,272
You have to go buy light bulbs.

257
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,189
Ahmad, listen!
Elly went to phone.

258
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,550
Take her for a ride.

259
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,557
Leave her a little peace.

260
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,113
There is still no hot water.

261
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,356
I put the water heater on. It's coming.

262
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,913
The 3 Days will pass soon


263
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,950
and you didn't do a thing.

264
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,670
What are you looking for?

265
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,598
Ahmad goes shopping.

266
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,836
I told him
to fuel the car.

267
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,439
Here, the keys.

268
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,630
I come back tomorrow.
I'll be there around midnight.

269
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,991
By bus, yes.

270
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,989
Do not worry.
I will be with a colleague.

271
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,394
She's fine.

272
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,593
Mom, if someone calls,
don't say that I left town.

273
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,635
Say you don't know where I am.

274
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,796
Do you still have any pain?

275
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,999
Love.

276
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,433
Yes, I am careful.
We're all colleagues, I say.

277
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,789
Okay.

278
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,312
I'll call you.
There 's no connection here.

279
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,478
We talk later.

280
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,595
Love. Goodbye.

281
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,555
Could  you call?

282
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,239
Yes, thank you.

283
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,915
Was she worried?

284
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,318
My mom is always worried.
She just had a heart surgery.

285
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,839
Recently?

286
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,670
A month ago. The doctor
told her to avoid stress.

287
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,474
If I had called 1 hour later,
she probably would have had a heart attack!

288
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,635
"Hi, Mom.
Yes, I'm fine and you?

289
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,070
"Of course I eat ..."

290
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,670
She thought I was dying of hunger in
Germany.

291
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,235
Once at the airport,
they opened my suitcase.

292
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,870
A jar of pickles
broke!

293
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,753
It reeked of vinegar!
I was ashamed of my life!

294
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,515
She must be happy
that you came back.

295
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,838
She died two years ago.

296
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,869
I'm Sorry.

297
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,711
When I was in the midst of a divorce.

298
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,558
She has suffered, poor one.

299
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,597
I can ask a delicate question?

300
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,751
Is it about my honor?

301
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,117
No.

302
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,230
Go ..

303
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,555
Why did you separate?

304
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,435
From which one?

305
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,912
You are not obliged to answer me.

306
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,799
Why are you Interested?

307
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,588
I do not know.
To find out, anyway ...

308
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,759
To find out anyway ...

309
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,630
One morning we woke up,
we took our shower,

310
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,192
and at breakfast, she said:
"Achmed,

311
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,597
"Besser ein Ende mit Schrecken ...

312
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,716
"..als ein Schrecken ohne Ende."

313
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,516
What?

314
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,790
Go ahead. Repeat.

315
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,558
- What?
- Besser ...

316
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,071
ein Ende mit Schrecken ...

317
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,517
I can not, sorry!

318
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,953
You want me to stop?

319
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,315
No, I know who it is.
I call back later.

320
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,439
So what does it mean?

321
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,476
A bitter end is much better than
a bitterness without ending.

322
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,828
It's true.

323
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,234
A little music.

324
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,070
- You're so late.
- A little, yes.

325
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,393
Did you have fun, Ahmad?

326
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,476
Good morning.

327
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,112
Arash, help bring these inside, little man?

328
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,197
At night it's cold.

329
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,751
Here is the bed for the newlyweds.

330
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,359
We are all newlyweds!

331
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,278
But the all-new

332
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,999
lovebirds ...

333
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,756
Where are they? Show them to me.

334
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,398
Congratulations!
I wish you happiness!

335
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,669
What are you doing?

336
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,755
You have dinner with us?

337
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,430
No thank you.
Just keep the doors locked.

338
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,474
And your cars
are not protected here.

339
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,069
Dinner is served.

340
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,433
Go. I shut the door.

341
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,797
Eat well, Ahmad.
You will not get this food in Germany.

342
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,433
Especially not for free!

343
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,037
Children, come!

344
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,754
Why are you standing. Go sit down.

345
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,439
Come on, Elly.

346
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,868
Ahmad, make a little room.

347
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,599
- It's ok here.
- Go ahead dear.

348
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,711
Ahmad is going to be sad.

349
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,439
Manoochehr!

350
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,394
Push yourself a little.

351
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,871
Does anyone need anything?

352
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,916
I'm coming.

353
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,594
- I get you some salad?
- I will do it, thank you.

354
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,189
- You are shy.
- No, I am ok.

355
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,190
Here.

356
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,835
Are you crazy?

357
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,630
Don't use it all. It's for the toilet.

358
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,039
Eh, Amir!

359
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,355
- The toilet?
- We're at the table!

360
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,549
And the salt?

361
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,393
It's in the kitchen.

362
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,430
Manoochehr, c'mon.

363
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,108
I forgot the salt?

364
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,796
You've washed your hands, my cowboy?

365
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,869
Please take some.

366
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,953
Congratulations.

367
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,836
Long live the newlyweds

368
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,469
Eat, it cools.

369
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,076
Elly, dear did you find it?

370
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,232
Thank you, how nice.

371
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,994
Who wants salt?

372
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,838
Enough.
Put this on hold.

373
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,236
Why are you guys out here alone?

374
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,238
Ahmad, what are you doing here?
Stand up!

375
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:27,952
Why?

376
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,912
- How did it go?
- What?

377
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,553
When you were out.

378
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,718
He is already stiff crazy about her.

379
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,155
I'm in love

380
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,909
Passionately in love

381
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,678
Stop it. Seriously.

382
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,595
At the end of the weekend, we will vote.
If the majority says yes,

383
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,518
I'll ask for her hand.
If not, no.

384
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,755
The majority, is them?

385
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,155
We, we all agree.

386
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,679
And you, Amir?

387
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,799
- It's not my business.
- Give your opinion.

388
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,151
- She is a nice girl.
- Is that all?

389
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,079
Yeah.

390
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,791
She is warm, quiet.
I like her.

391
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,433
- Really?
- Yes.

392
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,755
Seriously?

393
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,992
She seems uncomplicated.

394
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,475
And you, Manoochehr?

395
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,754
She is nice.

396
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,073
-Can I say?
- Ok

397
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,474
You laugh at me.

398
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,470
She is great.

399
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,398
- Really?
- I swear.

400
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,711
I'm going, you can talk now.

401
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,114
Can you bring us
two teas please?

402
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,753
Come join your families instead!

403
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,393
No, don't touch it!

404
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,794
Fire! Fire!

405
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,999
What did you do to us?

406
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,274
Stop exploiting my girlfriend.

407
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,357
It's your girlfriend she won't stop.

408
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,312
We like you even if you do nothing.

409
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,954
- Give this it to me.
- I wanted to make some tea ...

410
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,195
I leave it there.

411
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,517
Come on, girls.
We'll do that tomorrow.

412
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,035
- Come, let's sit.
- We will.

413
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,149
- How do you find her?
- She is nice.

414
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,237
A little too reserved, no?

415
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,839
She is embarrassed, poor one.

416
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,193
Four words.

417
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,755

433
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,389
Mother?

434
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,672
The mother of the honey bee!

435
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,033
Two words?

436
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,639
Is it two words, my honey?

437
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,516
Mother?
Child?

438
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,271

459
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,398

460
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,869

Long live the law school kids!

00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,714
I go inside, folks.

465
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,069
- Why?
- I have to care of something.

466
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,998
We were about to crush them.

467
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,028
Here we go! 

468
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,790
Elly!

469
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,671
We go shopping.
Do you need anything?

470
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,915
Two minutes, I come too.

471
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,714
- Tell me what you need.
- Ineed to get my ticket.

472
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,715
In your dreams!

473
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,636
Shohreh ...

474
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,359
Sepideh ...

475
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,355
Wait ...

476
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,149
Arash.

477
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,039
No, it's impossible

478
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,596
- Close the door.
- There is nobody, come on.

479
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,953
I really have to go back this afternoon.

480
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,070
No, it's impossible

481
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,157
Don't you like it here Elly?

482
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,952
No, Naazy, it was expected.

483
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,276
I said
I would stay just one night.

484
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,913
The guys should clean up.

485
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,712
Arash, you stay beside the water.

486
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,588
What an outfit.

487
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,030
What a short journey for you then.

488
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,312
You won't find a bus.
You'll have to walk home.

489
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,158
- Then I will.
- By foot?

490
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,468
Come on, lady!

491
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,675
My mom is going to argue, my dear.

492
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,199
You come, Shohreh?

493
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,879
Sepideh ...

494
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,552
I would stay if I could.

495
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,990
- You must stay.
- My mother will be worried.

496
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,392
- Naazy, you watch the children?
- Yes.

497
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,114
I tell her
that you have been kept by force.

498
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,110
If it's like that
I'll grab a taxi by the side of the road.

499
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,958
I really have to leave.

500
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,357
If she wants to leave
don't force her, Sepideh.

501
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,793
I wish I could stay.
Sepideh knows why.

502
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,000
We came together.
And we leave together.

503
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,231
- 'Till later


504
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,671
Amir ... keys!

505
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,839
Amir, where are the keys?

506
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,439
On the terrace, with my mobile phone.

507
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,759
Give it, be nice...

508
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,157
Be nice ...

509
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,273
Arash, darling ...

510
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,714
- Don't go further away.
- Okay.

511
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,957
Play a little and go inside.

512
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,751
Naazy, watch him, please.

513
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,678
Don't forget the onions.

514
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,873
What did she say?

515
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,036
To buy onions.

516
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,316
Relax,
we'll make a good soup tonight.

517
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,079
Nice ring.

518
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:53,951
Thank you.

519
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,436
Elly dear, please watch the children?
I'll clean up a little.

520
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,439
What's up?

521
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,479
Please fix it for me.

522
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,829
Ok.

523
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,309
Come hold it.

524
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,469
I have to go now.

525
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,434
Daddy!

526
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,799
Yes, darling?

527
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,992
Daddy! Arash!

528
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,350
Come here.
Let Arash alone.

529
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,669
Arash ...

530
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,431
Itake care of your dad, here!

531
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,996
Daddy! Daddy!

532
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,998
- Dad, Arash!
- Morvarid?

533
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,278
Arash is in the water!

534
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,509
Arash!

535
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,914
Where is Arash?

536
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,836
There!

537
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,677
My God!

538
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,314
He was in the water?
Who watched you?

539
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,428
Go see
if he is inside!

540
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,313
Arash!

541
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,077
Is he here?

542
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,390
He is in the water!

543
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,629
Amir!

544
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,995
His shoes!

545
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,269
Manoochehr!

546
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,669
Manoochehr!

547
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,031
Ahmad! Ahmad!

548
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,269
Ahmad!

549
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,397
On the other side! 

550
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,589
To your left!

551
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,311
He is there, Ahmad!

552
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,471
He is here!

553
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,238
Look it breathes.

554
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,311
Look if he breathes!

555
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,789
Put him there.

556
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,876
On the side,
to empty the lungs.

557
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,039
Raise his head.

558
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,599
Wake up, my son!

559
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,876
Arash!

560
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,750
You've left the Children like that?
Where were their mothers?

561
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,439
Elly was with them.

562
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,349
Ahmad!

563
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,389
Elly!

564
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,791
- Was she in the water?
-Morvarid was playing, she didn't see her.
 
565
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,070
Morvarid!
Where was Elly?

566
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,995
- Inside?
- No.

567
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,952
And if she was with Arash?

568
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,830
Elly!

569
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,879
What happened?

570
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,674
Naazy?

571
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,669
What ...

572
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,549
Arash!

573
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,678
Was Elly in the water with you?

574
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,869
Why?

575
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,514
- Hey, was she in the water, too?
- She dissappeared!

576
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,795
Young man, help!

577
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,595
Run! Go ahead. "

578
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,355
What a catastrophe!

579
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,597
Peyman?

580
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,670
Arash?

581
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,878
Don't be afraid.
It's Elly.

582
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,155
Oh no!

583
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,114
She wanted to save Arash ...

584
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,275
Where is my son?

585
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,356
Inside.

586
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,829
Sepideh!

587
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,999
Please help!

588
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,473
Who is in the water?

589
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,715
Elly!

590
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,515
Elly?

591
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,151
Sepideh!

592
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,554
Do not go!

593
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,551
Sepideh!

594
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,069
What happened?

595
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,238
- We didn't find her.
- Do not stop!

596
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,278
The sea is rough.

597
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,119
You can't just stop like that.

598
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,715
Wait!
Take me.

599
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,074
She may be trapped
between the rocks.

600
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,399
Let us go!

601
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,670
Take me, I beg you!

602
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,275
You didn't look over there.

603
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,751
That's where they found the child.

604
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,995
We can not leave her like that.

605
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,990
At daybreak
the sea will calm.

606
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,198
Where are you going? I beg you.
She  may still be alive.

607
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,960
We searched
for over half an hour.

608
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,912
Pity! If she is alive ...

609
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,872
She can't be alive anymore.

610
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,548
Did i ask you?

611
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,149
Sepideh! Go inside!

612
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,634
Shohreh, take her!

613
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,078
Peyman, don't let them leave.

614
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,430
The sea will bring back the body.

615
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,757
If you browse the beach tonight
you will find her.

616
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,557
Sepideh!

617
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,039
Sepideh.

618
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,591
They want details
Her identity.

619
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,995
She was playing with her kite
and she saw nothing.

620
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,156
You've seen her go into the water?

621
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,430
- No.
- What did you see?

622
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,478
- Arash screaming in the water.
- And then?

623
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,193
This is my son.

624
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,676
I called my father
to come save him.

625
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,952
Okay. Are you sure the woman
went in the water?

626
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,839
I asked her
to watch the children.

627
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,439
What was her name?

628
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,312
- Elly.
- Elly?

629
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,874
Elham Elnaz, Elmira ...?
The full name.

630
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,596
Don't you know her?

631
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,949
She called Elly.

632
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,639
What was your relationship with her?

633
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,914
It was my daughter's teacher.
My wife invited her.

634
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,197
You don't know the name
of your daughter's teacher?

635
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,999
I will ask.

636
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,277
You bring
someone from Tehran

637
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,357
without knowing anything about her

638
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,551
and we
we have to rely on a child?

639
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,954
What's her name?

640
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,078
I don't know.

641
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,118
You don't know her name?

642
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,031
Unfortunately, she does not know.

643
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,034
Have a look in her bag.
She must have any papers.

644
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,312
I would like the identities
of you.

645
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,830
And your papers, please.

646
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,798
Who is the owner of the villa?

647
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,109
Ahmad!

648
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,952
Her bag is not there!

649
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,912
Just search a little better.

650
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,269
I searched, there is nothing!

651
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,314
Naazy, give me Peyman's bag ...

652
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,312
Shohreh, her bag is not there!

653
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,399
It must be in her room.

654
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,269
What if she left?

655
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,229
Didn't you say she was with the kids?

656
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,911
She was ready to go.

657
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,794
She wanted to go by foot.
Not true, Shohreh?

658
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,473
Would she leave
without saying goodbye?

659
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,874
And why is her purse gone?

660
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,872
My God ...

661
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,795
Sepideh!

662
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:15,990
What's her number?

663
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,474
- Who?
- Elly.

664
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,874
I'll call her cellphone.

665
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,354
What are you talking about?

666
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,595
- The bag ...
- What?

667
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,155
It is not there.
Maybe she did really go.

668
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,918
Nobody saw her going in the water.

669
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,111
I had to keep it hidden.

670
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,430
I should have let her go.

671
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,555
I should have let her go.

672
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,439
My God ...

673
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,069
Mom!

674
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,671
God curse you, Sepideh.

675
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,040
We have to notify his family.

676
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,510
Wait and see
if the body shows up tonight.

677
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,109
Maybe she really has left.

678
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,435
Left where?

679
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,599
It's over.

680
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,430
She died.

681
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,033
We should call them tomorrow.

682
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,277
They will not make the road
at night ...

683
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,191
Today will be a lot of traffic.
It's gonna be hell.

684
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,634
Oh my!

685
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,749
Damn!

686
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,595
Amir ...

687
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,993
If she had drowned
we would have found the body.

688
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,472
Wake up,
we must do something.

689
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,752
You've done enough already.

690
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,349
Wake up, I say.

691
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,118
For what?
Well, I'm awake.

692
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,629
Lets go look at the bus station.

693
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,955
I don't know what to tell you ...

694
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,639
Damn me.

695
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,353
Yes damn me.

696
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:33,316
There may be a chance
that she left.

697
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,989
Listen, I'm talking to you.

698
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,758
I don't want you to talk to me!

699
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,033
You fucked up
and you want to talk?

700
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,832
Listen, I'm exhausted, too.

701
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,074
Why did you invite her?

702
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,471
OK, it's my fault.
So what can we do now?

703
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,511
Nothing more.

704
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,593
You didn't need a consulter 
for inviting her?

705
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,995
- I thought that Ahmad ...
- Who are you, for Ahmad?

706
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,553
His mother?

707
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,955
His sister? Who are you?

708
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,116
What's up Amir?

709
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,353
Why should it be her fault?

710
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,151
It's not her fault.

711
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,079
Nothing ever is.

712
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,394
I told her to invite Elly.

713
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,278
You shouldn't have!

714
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,632
Why didn't you ask someone else?

715
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,395
You'll wake the children.

716
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,590
For so many years
you don't know this fool?

717
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,678
Who could have predicted
she would come with us ...

718
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,711
She always takes care!

719
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,996
You want to go to sea
Ask Sepideh!

720
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,191
People want to meet:
Ask Sepideh!

721
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,719
You look for a villa:
Sepideh!

722
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,593
You need a ticket:
Sepideh!

723
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,036
You wanna get married;
Sepideh!

724
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,317
Go inside, we find a solution.

725
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,158
Solution?

726
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,789
He have to call the parents.

727
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,753
Okay. For now let's go inside.

728
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:02,710
Kids, the one who tells it the best
will get  a huge gift.

729
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:06,516
Go ahead and start.
What you did, you?

730
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,109
I was with my kite.

731
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:09,911
And then?

732
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,111
Arash was in the water.

733
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,637
And where was Elly?

734
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,909
She was up there.

735
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,428
On the terrace.

736
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,595
What were you doing?

737
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,156
I asked her to
set my kite.

738
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:26,273
She came and played with
the kite. And then I saw Arash.

739
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,796
When your kite was up there

740
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,553
was Elly with you?

741
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:38,117
Look at me. When you, were there
was Elly staining over there,

742
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,959
where Naazy is standing now?

743
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,119
She was there at the beginning.

744
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,593
And after?

745
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,673
I ran after my kite to 
the other side.

746
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,193
And there I saw Arash.

747
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,515
You saw Arash.

748
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,514
Stop it, Arash.

749
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,957
Anita? Have you Elly
leave the villa?

750
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,591
- Look at me.
- I have not seen.

751
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,273
Morvarid, darling,

752
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:19,076
when your kite
fell into the water,

753
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,872
and Arash was drowning,

754
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,038
was Elly there?
Or was she leaving the house?

755
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,958
- She was there.
- Okay.

756
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,313
When you came to call
and we played volleyball,

757
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,954
you know, when you cried,

758
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,593
Elly was still there?

759
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,631
She was there before that.

760
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,039
Before, how long?

761
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:40,990
A little.

762
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,872
What is a little sweetie?

763
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,752
1 to what?

764
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,679
1 ... 2 ... 3 ... 4 ...?

765
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,832
1 ... 2 ... 3 ...

766
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,229
I don't know.

767
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,915
And you, Arash, darling?

768
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,476
When you were in the water,
Did Elly come to help you?

769
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,433
Raise your head and answered correctly.

770
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,629
I answered a hundred times yesterday.

771
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,796
Sit down and answer well!

772
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,672
- I'm hungry.
- Get out of here then!

773
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:10,956
Peyman!

774
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,755
What way is that to behave?

775
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,520

- I was in the water, I saw nothing!

776
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,835
What is wrong with you?

777
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,193
He answers strangly!

778
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,472
Since yesterday evening
you mistreat this child!

779
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,069
That's it, go away and shut up.

780
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,159
I am silent
and take everything?

781
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,590
You let him alone at
the edge of the water!

782
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,633
Has told you not to take
a villa on the beach!

783
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,316
Anita, come.

784
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,588
Any News?

785
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,749
Nothing since yesterday evening.

786
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,599
Why should she gone?

787
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,792
Who knows.

788
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,030
She would have taken her bag.

789
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,912
But Sepideh had hidden it ...

790
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,589
Sepideh,

791
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,911
Could Elly have done such a thing?

792
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,315
What thing?

793
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,632
Leaving without saying anything.

794
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:16,516
I don't know.

795
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,280
Why you did you hide her bag,
then?

796
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,632
You thought that she could
leave like that.

797
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,953
The other night as she disappeared.
He was looking everywhere.

798
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,196
It was because of her phone connection.

799
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,473
She wanted to make a call.

800
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,869
Without saying a word.

801
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,150
- It's different.
- What?

802
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,317
- Why should she leave?
- In spite.

803
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,157
What?

804
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,714
She may be upset.

805
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,279
Why?

806
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:50,477
Did anyone notice anything?
Or say anything upsetting to her?

807
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,238
Dad, I'm hungry.

808
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:59,750
The other night,
When I served grill

809
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,075
and you arrived

810
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:06,229
the lady brought the beds,
she began to clap and sing.

811
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,510
And you, Shohreh,
you made noises.

812
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,750
It seemed Elly was upset.

813
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,919
Noises? It was a joke.

814
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,588
I just thought.

815
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:18,755
And for dinner?

816
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,353
When she went to get the salt
we all laughed.

817
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,350
But that was just a little fun.

818
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,515
We all laughed.

819
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,233
She too laughed.

820
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,432
All this jokes, the dancing,

821
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,595
Could that have embarrassed her?

822
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,360
Yesterday morning
she insisted on leaving,

823
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,118
as if she was worried about something.

824
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:41,118
I told you not to force her to stay!

825
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,833
She was just over there.

826
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,837
You told heras a joke
she should go by foot

827
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,598
and she said: "Ok i will."

828
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:55,869
Sepideh?

829
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,391
You who know her

830
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,273
Was she such a person?

831
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,879
To be offended and leave?

832
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,274
Take offended by what?

833
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,957
She doesn't even know her name.
How does she know?

834
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,436
Amir, stop quibbling.
We try to move forward.

835
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:16,833
When we did the dishes,
Sepideh, you said something,

836
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,318
And Shohreh said:
"We like you even if you do nothing."

837
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,078
I think that offended her.

838
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,236
But I didn't mean any harm.

839
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:30,718
I know. I say that there
may have been a misunderstanding.

840
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,837
Please don't start 
blaming me for that too!

841
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,519
I didn't blame you.

842
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:38,554
She must be very immature
to be offended by a sentence like that!

843
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,556
Calm down, we are just talking!

844
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,639
Did you see how they all look at
my son since yesterday evening?

845
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,513
Nothing you said offended her.

846
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,631
Ahmad, I talk about that!

847
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,400
Even if she was offended,
that's not a reason to leave.

848
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,472
If she is reasonable.

849
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,434
But if she
really just left like that

850
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,154
without saying anything, she really is a. ..

851
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,236
Peyman ...

852
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:04,399
We were told this place is open
to everybody. And if someone ...

853
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,828
What are you talking here?

854
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:08,795
Call Tehran,
see if she returned.

855
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,999
It's too early. It's 7:30.

856
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,158
So it is 7:30 !
I can't take it anymore.

857
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,510
Ahmad, come, we'll call.

858
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,309
No, you don't move.
Ahmad, you go alone.

859
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:21,908
- Why?
- You stay here.

860
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,997
- But how ...
- Don't make it worse!

861
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,997
It is better a woman calls.

862
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,952
Sepideh is the only woman here?

863
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,998
I could go too.

864
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,598
But if they say she's not back ...

865
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,472
Just thinking about it, makes me shake.

866
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,910
- Amir, let me ...
- I said no!

867
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:40,954
Ahmad, let's go.

868
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,191
I come with you.

869
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,436
It's Okay, I'm going.

870
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:44,914
Come Manoochehr.

871
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,036
Ahmad ...

872
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,156
Sepideh, you give me her home number?

873
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,154
You want me to go with them?

874
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,839
Ahmad is going.

875
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,676
Go get a breakfast
for the children.

876
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,110
They may stay one day
without breakfast.

877
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,231
For one day, they will not die!

878
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,634
Keys.

879
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:07,715
What a weekend!

880
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,509
Go ..
No, wait.

881
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,039
The other wheel is also stuck.

882
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,196
Ahmad!

883
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,709
It's stuck in sand.

884
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,556
Come down, we'll make it.

885
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:38,599
If her mother answers, say nothing.

886
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,195
Why?

887
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,679
The other day she told me
she has heart problems.

888
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,916
I don't wanna shock her.

889
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:54,150
A foreign person drowned because of
our child. You understand that?

890
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,193
And your only problem,
is to go on my nerves?

891
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,118
Do not talk like that.

892
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,280
I told you  a 100 times not 
to talk to me like that in public.

893
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:04,993
Like what?

894
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,875
I have no other concern now?
How am i talking?

895
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,399
Like you did before.

896
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,875
I have always been the same 
since college.

897
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,878
And in twenty years,
I will still be the same shit i am now.

898
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,469
I want to go to Tehran.

899
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,751
- You can not ...
- I want to go.

900
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,316
Shohreh ...

901
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,272
I want to go.

902
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:31,597
The sound of the sea 
drives me crazy.

903
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,916
My son peed his bed.

904
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,191
Everyone disrespects him.

905
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,799
Am more worse than you all.

906
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,674
The image of this girl
does not leave me ...

907
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,155
Sepideh, you have an aspirin?

908
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,430
Take paracetamol in my bag.

909
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,315
Aain her  mother.

910
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,794
Do not hang up this time.

911
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:56,914
You say it is her heart ...

912
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,030
Just say that you are

913
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,357
a student's parent
and you want to talk with her.

914
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:04,279
At this hour?

915
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,679
What if this province number shows up?

916
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,598
Say you're the husband of a girlfriend.

917
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,119
Sepideh should have come.

918
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,748
What a honeymoon
I am so sorry ...

919
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,232
Thank you, my boy.

920
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,752
Honk.

921
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:29,995
Where you going?

922
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,553
I was worried.

923
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,034
- Was she in Tehran?


924
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:33,956
Get in.

925
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,588
What happened?

926
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,996
Did she have family problems?

927
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,269
Why?

928
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,232
Her mother was very evasive.

929
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,953
She was not back then?

930
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,032
She said she went out for a minute.

931
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,670
Thank you, my God.

932
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,949
No, wait.

933
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,913
At first she said that
I asked if she returned from the trip.

934
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,838
She said: "What trip?"

935
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,951
- What?
- She lied to me.

936
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:02,115
In addition, she said
that Elly left her mobile phone at home.

937
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,912
But she had it with her.

938
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:06,478
She asked me ten times
who I was.

939
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,876
Did her family know
she came with us?

940
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:12,552
Didn't she call her mother,
the other night?

941
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,479
Yes, but her mother ...

942
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:16,830
His mother ...

943
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:20,311
She answered really suspicious.

944
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:23,478
Maybe because we hung up
several times before she was suspicious.

945
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:27,753
But if she had confidence in her daughter
why be suspecious?

946
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,119
How long do you know her?

947
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,833
Not long.

948
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,555
What happened?

949
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,758
Nobody piked up the phone.

950
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,394
Damn what a bummer!

951
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,157
You should've tried again.

952
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,150
Ahmad ...

953
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,954
We tried ten times.

954
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,515
Sepideh.

955
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:16,756
Come here.

956
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:23,914
What's up?

957
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,919
Where is her phone?

958
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:31,189
Why?

959
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,517
Let's call a number in
her phone.

960
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,551
She's took it with her.

961
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,269
Where's That?

962
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:41,438
I don't know.
Why are you asking me this?

963
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:42,789
Come here.

964
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,514
- What is it?
- Tell me what you know about her.

965
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,438
What I know about her?

966
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:52,439
Whose is that?
It's hers, right?

967
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:54,950
- Where was it?
- In your bag.

968
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,197
Why is her mobile phone in your bag?

969
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:58,836
I forgot.

970
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,919
I found it yesterday
by the windows.

971
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:05,190
Don't lie to me!

972
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,549
What is wrong with you?

973
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,034
Leave me alone.

974
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,390
Stop! Asshole!

975
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:14,309
What's the matter?
Why don't you speak?

976
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:15,397
Bitch!

977
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,114
Amir, are you not ashamed?
Get off!

978
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,039
Don't you meddle with it!

979
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,753
Don't you meddle with it, Shohreh.

980
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,918
Get in the car.

981
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:25,955
You should be ashamed!

982
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,878
Get in the car.

983
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,638
Peyman, lets return to Tehran.

984
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,638
She is dead!

985
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,512
Now you want 
to kill us, too?

986
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,349
I'm not staying here.

987
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:38,120
- What did you do?
- She lies to me.

988
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:39,719
I want to know ...

989
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,388
Why is her phone
in your bag?

990
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,076
What the hell?

991
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,477
You'd better
shut up Ahmad.

992
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:49,759
Leave it Ahmad.

993
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,349
Nobody said anything here?

994
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,274
You do as you like.
Me, I'm leaving!

995
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,710
You go, Sepideh.

996
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,149
Ahmad!

997
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,634
Go back, please.

998
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,035
Morvarid, go inside, my dear.

999
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,150
Peyman ...

1000
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,196
It makes me crazy.

1001
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:23,111
We will send the women
and children in Tehran.

1002
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,630
She forced me
to raise my hands on it.

1003
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,036
We can't just leave.

1004
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,878
Everybody wants to go.

1005
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,718
Let's go, Mom.

1006
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,558
It's hard for the kids.

1007
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,955
You go ..
I've got to stay.

1008
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:45,590
Sepideh,
your presence will not change anything.

1009
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,438
I can not, Peyman.

1010
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,153
Naazy ...

1011
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,554
She's hurt.

1012
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,430
Sepideh, listen to me a bit ...

1013
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,756
No, Ahmad.

1014
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,555
If this girl really just left
silently,

1015
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:03,194
is it worth
you give yourself all this trouble?

1016
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,550
For a girl you don't know nothing about?

1017
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,478
- Peyman ...
- No, really?

1018
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,510
Peyman.

1019
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,190
And if she drowned because of Arash,
isn't she worth it?

1020
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,029
Who says she drowned
for my Arash?

1021
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:19,755
And i didn't even said
she should watch my child that ...

1022
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,713
Let her, if she wants to stay.

1023
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,638
We are discussing, Peyman.

1024
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,637
Why bother?

1025
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:33,634
Was it me who invited her to the sea
and who kept her from leaving?

1026
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,149
No, it was me.

1027
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,749
You leave and leave me alone.

1028
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,830
Get Ellys phone from Amir.

1029
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,629
Amir ...

1030
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,678
Give me Ellys phone please.

1031
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,315
Thank you.

1032
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,197
How can i unlock it?

1033
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,312
Call one of the numbers.

1034
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:15,637
What time did I go out
with her the other night?

1035
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,556
About ten o'clock I think.

1036
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:22,556
She received a call, she rejected
saying she would call back.

1037
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:25,638
Call this number then
and tell the truth.

1038
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,876
I think we should stay, too

1039
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,915
If her family comes here and sees 4 guys,
isn't it weird?

1040
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,270
Her mother was already very suspicious.

1041
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,313
I thought no one answered?

1042
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,435
Wait for me. I'll call.

1043
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,278
We'll see what happens.

1044
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,069
Have you spoken to her mother?

1045
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,360
She didn't even know Elly 
came on this trip.

1046
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,876
Come Manoochehr.

1047
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,469
- Where are the keys?
- On the car.

1048
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:58,672
The car.

1049
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:02,952
What a strange girl.

1050
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,957
How did we find her phone?

1051
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,559
In Sepideh's bag.

1052
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,397
Naazy was looking for pills
and  found it.

1053
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:20,913
Wait, Ahmad.

1054
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,549
Where are you going?

1055
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,671
- Making a phone call.
- Who?

1056
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,677
The Number that
called the other night.

1057
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:36,440
- I come with you.
- You know your husband ...

1058
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,390
I come.

1059
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,397
I call and I'll be back.

1060
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:40,789
Mom, I'm coming too.

1061
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,316
Ahmad ...

1062
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,439
Go alone.

1063
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:56,316
Shohreh told me to watch
the Children.

1064
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:02,234
Do you remember the pantomime game?

1065
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:05,711
At one time, Elly said:''Gladiolus.''

1066
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:10,678
Like a premonition. She felt
what would happen to her.

1067
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:16,638
All this was written.
Nobody is responsible.

1068
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,751
I had a dream.

1069
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:19,870
What dream?

1070
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,753
A nightmare.

1071
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:25,913
I can't forget it.

1072
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,029
Shall we turn around?

1073
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:31,836
No. Drive a little more.

1074
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,159
- She hasn't returned?
- No.

1075
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,274
Who did you talk to?

1076
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,910
- Her brother.
- You told her?

1077
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,395
I described Elly.

1078
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:16,354
I said
I found his number on her Phone.

1079
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,314
If he knows where
she is.

1080
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:21,919
He was surprised that
I have her phone.

1081
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:26,432
I asked what their relationship was.
He said he was her brother.

1082
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,473
But he doesn't know where she is.

1083
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,792
I had to tell him the truth.

1084
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,755
- You said that she drowned?
- No, I couldn't.

1085
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,958
I said we had an
accident here in the north.

1086
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,673
and that she was in the hospital.

1087
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,276
He was surprised
that she is in the north.

1088
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:44,834
She didn't tell her family.

1089
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,440
That's why
she wanted to return so eagerly.

1090
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:51,438
And now he comes here?

1091
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:53,073
Yes, he will.

1092
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:56,033
He arrives around 16h to Chalous.

1093
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:59,392
How are we gonna tell him?

1094
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,556
We have to somehow.

1095
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,631
One woman has to come with us.

1096
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,234
- A women has to come.
- What?

1097
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,591
One of you must go.

1098
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,838
Stop, Ahmad. I feel bad.

1099
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,759
You haven't eaten anything.

1100
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,078
Do you need anything?

1101
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,916
Should i take Naazy instead?

1102
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,799
It's not his brother.

1103
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:00,708
Who?

1104
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,915
One who is coming.

1105
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:10,199
She told me
she was an only child.

1106
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,518
So who is this guy?

1107
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,790
I think ... her fiance.

1108
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,554
Who's finace?

1109
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,389
Elly's.

1110
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,354
What you're saying, Sepideh?

1111
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,275
She was engaged?

1112
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,590
What have you done?

1113
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,873
What have you done?

1114
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:58,279
If you knew she was engaged,
why did you introduce her to me?

1115
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:02,070
She wanted to break up.
She tried for 6 months.

1116
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,992
The guy won't leave her.

1117
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,673
Oh God ...

1118
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,234
Oh God ...

1119
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:15,311
I had hidden her phone
so noone could call him.

1120
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,149
Is that him?

1121
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,953
The one with the bag?

1122
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,149
I don't know.

1123
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,592
Hello, how are you?

1124
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,433
You've arrived?

1125
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,949
We are on the spot.

1126
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,829
In front of the surgical clinic.

1127
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:07,870
Imam Reza.

1128
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,991
The Clinique Imam Reza.

1129
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,994
Where? A green sedan?

1130
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,951
I don't see it.

1131
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:23,556
On the other side of the bridge?
At the entrance to the ring ...

1132
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,633
Yes, very well.
I'll be right there.

1133
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,230
We have a Patrol.
Well, see you soon.

1134
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,471
- He came by car?
- Yes.

1135
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,236
- You drive back with him.
- No.

1136
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:37,839
We have no choice.

1137
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,713
I ave to drive ahead
and warn the others.

1138
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,280
He doesn't know, that we
know he is her fiance.

1139
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,117
Okay.

1140
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,470
I drive and tell the others.
You drive with him.

1141
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,875
- Be very careful.
- I know.

1142
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:07,836
Good day.

1143
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,595
- Are you Ali reza?
- Yes.

1144
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,677
Ahmad. Delighted.

1145
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,757
Have you been here long?

1146
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,439
Did you have the accindent?

1147
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,758
No, one of our friends.

1148
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,791
In which Hospital is she?

1149
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,752
- We takes you there.
- How is she?

1150
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,952
- We better hurry.
- Go ..

1151
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,509
Could you give me her phone?

1152
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,073
It is at the villa.

1153
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,269
Tell me about ...

1154
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:32,313
I'll tell you.
Ahmad, you go.

1155
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:33,794
I tell you.

1156
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,109
Where do we go?

1157
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,517
We take the bypass.

1158
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,278
Please talk to me.

1159
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:43,670
We told you on the phone.

1160
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:45,909
Is she alive?

1161
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:52,070
Yes, but she's not doing good.

1162
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,399
She is in a coma.

1163
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,557
Oh, my God!

1164
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,919
She was not supposed to come here.
When was the accident?

1165
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,759
We talk on the road.

1166
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,918
Madam, stop confusing me.

1167
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:09,713
You've seen her papers.

1168
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,873
What is her name?

1169
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,194
Elly.

1170
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,957
Elly appears
on her papers?

1171
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:24,277
Elly is the teacher of my daughter.

1172
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,756
We did not want to scare you.

1173
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,428
She came with us
for the weekend and...

1174
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:30,990
What are you waiting here?

1175
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,792
And the story of the accident?

1176
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,594
I'm sorry. Let's go.

1177
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,519
What is it?

1178
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:40,709
I'm not on my plate ...

1179
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,229
- Me neither.
- Keep your donkey mouth shut.

1180
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:47,476
- Go away mister!
- Shut up!

1181
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,559
Hi, Ahmad!

1182
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:02,958
Good morning.

1183
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:08,236
Amir!

1184
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,913
Peyman, Shohreh!

1185
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:11,155
Where is Amir?

1186
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,475
Come Naazy, quickly.

1187
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,717
Peyman, come.

1188
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:19,509
So, Ahmad?

1189
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:21,393
Hurry, Amir.

1190
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,510
Come all.

1191
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:27,996
Hurry. he is coming.

1192
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,474
You told him?

1193
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,392
He is not her brother.

1194
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:32,749
It is her fiance.

1195
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,673
She has a fiance?

1196
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:36,915
Damn!

1197
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,075
What does that mean?

1198
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:42,319
The bottom line is that he believes
we are not aware.

1199
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,754
She came here
she dragged with you,

1200
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,598
and is engaged?

1201
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:49,358
Pity, Peyman, now is not the time.

1202
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:51,349
How did you know?

1203
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,755
One of her girlfriends
called on her cellphone.

1204
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:57,551
I told her about the accident

1205
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,273
and the arrival of her brother.

1206
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,831
She told me Elly
was an only daughter.

1207
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,315
I asked who this man was.

1208
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,955
Probably her fiance''''
she said.

1209
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:11,033
Why did she come with us
if she is engaged?

1210
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,676
She didn't look like 
such a person.

1211
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:16,314
She did.
It's just us who are ...

1212
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,348
naive.

1213
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:23,552
So, if it is,
she did not drown.

1214
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:25,239
Maybe she really just left.

1215
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:29,194
If this guys finds out
why we brought his bride here,

1216
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,992
we are in big trouble.

1217
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,679
Now what?

1218
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,474
We pretend to know nothing.

1219
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:40,715
He is the brother.
Elly is the teacher of Morvarid.

1220
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,592
The childs wanted Elly
to come with us.

1221
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,153
She agreed. That's it.

1222
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:47,517
I beg you
get a grip of yourself.

1223
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,359
What if Elly hasn't drowned?

1224
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:51,949
I don't know ...

1225
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,513
Where is Sepideh?

1226
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,270
They drive together.

1227
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:57,959
She is aware of everything?

1228
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,071
Yes, I told her.

1229
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:03,274
She is supposed to
tell him about the drowning.

1230
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,438
What an actresses makes us all
going crazy!

1231
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:09,949
I have to warn the children.

1232
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:11,718
Where are they?

1233
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,713
Arash ... Morvarid ...

1234
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,669
Children, come here.
Listen to me.

1235
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,750
You know why Elly
came here with us?

1236
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:31,555
To watch me
not to go in the water.

1237
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,990
- Bravo that's good.
- But no.

1238
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,713
- Why then?
- Can i say?

1239
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:38,309
She came to fall in love with you.

1240
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,675
Me?

1241
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,508
Who told you that?

1242
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:43,835
I saw myself.

1243
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,713
No, you're wrong.
It was a joke, all that.

1244
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,035
Did you hear that, honey?

1245
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:51,869
That's why she was sad
and she left.

1246
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,196
No, my heart,
she was not sad.

1247
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,472
She wanted to save Arash
and she drowned.

1248
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:58,999
She is still in the water?

1249
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:01,509
Morvarid listen. You too.

1250
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:04,394
Elly's brother is coming here, ok?

1251
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:09,033
It is a very serious 
and is angry man.

1252
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,798
You have to promise me.

1253
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:13,630
Kids you have to promise...

1254
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:19,039
not to tell about
our jokes.

1255
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,589
- What jokes?
- Those mentioned by Arash.

1256
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:24,030
When we played,
we danced, we laughed.

1257
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:25,798
We used to play pantomime.

1258
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,912
Don't say anything.

1259
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:32,795
If he asks a questions,
you say:''We do not know.''

1260
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,433
-''We do not know.''
- Bravo.

1261
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:36,437
Can you say that too Anita?
Good.

1262
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:19,798
Did she tell him?

1263
01:26:24,040 --> 01:26:25,109
Don't go out.

1264
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,795
Wait on a sign of Sepideh.

1265
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,399
Come in.

1266
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:06,070
No, okay.

1267
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:18,239
Where did it happen?

1268
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,319
There.

1269
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:04,432
- Come, go.
- I want to be alone for a moment.

1270
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:41,390
What a quiet guy.

1271
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,874
I swear he knows.

1272
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,954
There must be
a reason for everything.

1273
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,273
Shhh! Here he comes.

1274
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,159
Do you a sedative?

1275
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:27,759
No. Toilets?

1276
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:30,670
This way.

1277
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:50,073
- Thank you.
- I beg you.

1278
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,798
Did he tell her parents?

1279
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,594
Not yet.

1280
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,598
Elly didn't tell you about him?

1281
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:33,716
Amir!

1282
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:00,271
Shohreh, you have a towel?

1283
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:03,836
No, thank you.
Can i be alone somewhere?

1284
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:05,393
This way.

1285
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:07,759
Go ahead. I beg you.

1286
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,796
Could you bring him a clean bedcover?

1287
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:08,158
There is no connection here.

1288
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:14,553
But I talked to her the other night.

1289
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:17,356
Must have been
when she was out.

1290
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:24,595
Excuse me ...

1291
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:27,434
just a second.

1292
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,836
Did she talk about me?

1293
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:41,192
Yes, she talked a lot about you
and her parents.

1294
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:42,879
What did she say?

1295
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:46,638
That she misses you very much.

1296
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:49,150
She spoke well of you.

1297
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,152
She was worried for her mother.

1298
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:55,353
I think her mother ... your mother
is a heart patient?

1299
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,235
Naazy ...

1300
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:10,918
- Sorry.
- Are you coming?

1301
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:28,871
It's not his brother. Why do
you she missed him?

1302
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:30,559
She spoke well of him?

1303
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:32,313
I didn't know what to say.

1304
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:33,988
Did he suspect anything?

1305
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:35,758
No ... I do not know.

1306
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,632
Don't you want to eat anything?

1307
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:04,517
I just have to make a
call to Tehran.

1308
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:07,075
- I accompany you.
- Okay.

1309
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:36,070
You can leave the bed of the
newlyweds, I'll take it.

1310
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:37,748
Thank you.

1311
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:45,434
Her poor husband was there this morning
but I did not want to bother him.

1312
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:48,549
- The husband of who?
- From the drowned.

1313
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:52,078
Her husband was here this morning?

1314
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,831
Madam, could you come here please?

1315
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:05,790
Peyman!

1316
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:07,870
He knows!

1317
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,591
The old woman told him.

1318
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:15,509
She said that the bed
was for Elly and her husband.

1319
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:16,948
Damn!

1320
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,119
Damn!

1321
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,196
Where is he?

1322
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:22,669
I guess he is coming.

1323
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:27,758
Do something.

1324
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:29,154
There's nothing more to do.

1325
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:30,594
We have to say the truth.

1326
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,074
We wanted to pair his wife 
with someone?

1327
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:33,554
We didn't know.

1328
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,434
It is true that we knew nothing.

1329
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,910
The best thing is to tell the truth.

1330
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:41,230
But say what?

1331
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,192
She didn't tell us
she was engaged.

1332
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:46,437
Otherwise, we would never
present her to Ahmad.

1333
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:48,312
Don't tell about Ahmad.

1334
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:49,675
What else should we say then?

1335
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:52,315
Among the cops
we'll have to confess everything.

1336
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,476
Does he know she came
for Ahmad?

1337
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:57,071
He is not stupid. He understood.

1338
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:00,238
He was suspicious before coming.

1339
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:03,480
Why does he pretend
to be her brother?

1340
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:06,398
- We tell him everything.
- No, I beg you.

1341
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,795
So what, Sepideh, lying?

1342
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:11,393
We can't.

1343
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,794
He knows anyway.

1344
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:15,355
We have no choice, Sepideh.

1345
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:18,598
- He will find out.
- Elly will be dishonored.

1346
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,199
We dishonor her?

1347
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,150
I respect the dead

1348
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,874
but an engaged woman 
looking for a husband.

1349
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:24,990
This means:

1350
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,758
1, she fooled us all,

1351
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:28,632
2, she fooled her fiance.

1352
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:30,195
Fooled?

1353
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:33,437
Obviously.
If you, you have a boyfriend

1354
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:36,029
and your boyfriend
finds a girl better than you

1355
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:37,753
for the weekend,
to play volleyball ...

1356
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,188
Where's the harm?

1357
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:40,435
You don't understand.

1358
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:43,029
From our point of view,
there is no harm.

1359
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,919
Put yourself in the position of the boy,
and everything is evil.

1360
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:47,912
From the money she has given

1361
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:49,918
to cleaning and staying here!

1362
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,516
That was all a show she played for us!

1363
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,312
We must decide now.

1364
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,911
She gave up that nice boy.

1365
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:00,429
I was ashamed of myself
when i saw him.

1366
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:03,156
The the noise i made the other night ...

1367
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:04,270
Hurry.

1368
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:07,153
Ahmad, tell him
we thought she was single.

1369
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:08,839
She lied to us.

1370
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:10,838
- We say the truth.
- Please don't.

1371
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:13,435
We lie to him
to save the honor of Elly?

1372
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:15,676
The dead have no need of honor.

1373
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:17,873
- I won't let it happen.
- Too late.

1374
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,468
- Ahmad, don't let them ...
- Peyman come here.

1375
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:43,675
I knew it.

1376
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:44,869
She had told me.

1377
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:48,915
I swear.
I'm not lying this time.

1378
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:50,833
On the head of my daughter.

1379
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:54,237
I told Ahmad
he was her fiance.

1380
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,518
Ahmad, why don't you tell them?

1381
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:00,751
There is nothing more to say.

1382
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:02,914
I told her

1383
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:06,271
a friend arrived from Germany
and I was asked ...

1384
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:10,509
to submit a woman.

1385
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:14,113
She said she doesn't want
to get married.

1386
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:18,108
That she has a fiance for 2 years
and wants to break up.

1387
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,834
She didn't love him.
He made her suffer.

1388
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:25,909
Her family are against it,
and he also wouldn't let her go.

1389
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:31,318
I offered her to meet our 
friend Ahmad during his brief stay.

1390
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:34,080
She said no,  not
until i haven't broken up.

1391
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:38,159
I sent Ahmad a photo of her,
and he liked her.

1392
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:40,920
So, I insisted her to come.

1393
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:49,678
And she said ...?
She was determined to break.

1394
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:54,239
I told her, if my friend
won't return to Iran anytime soon.

1395
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:57,240
You should meet him just once.

1396
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:58,839
She still refused.

1397
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:03,033
Finally, she agreed
provided that it remains a secret

1398
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:05,231
and just for one night.

1399
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:07,318
She had told me.

1400
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,957
You insisted her to come.

1401
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,192
But she wasn't forced to come?

1402
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:21,837
I begged.
I said that I had everything planned.

1403
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:23,710
My God!

1404
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:28,156
We can at least save her honor.

1405
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:34,077
If we say we really didn't know
she had a fiance

1406
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:35,315
would he believe that?

1407
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:36,555
Who would believe that?

1408
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:39,320
What does it change
if he believes it?

1409
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:43,155
Anyway,
she did wrong by coming here.

1410
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:44,828
But I insisted.

1411
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:46,390
It's not a reason.

1412
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:49,837
Tell the truth.
You say you didn't know.

1413
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:52,190
Me, I say that I knew.

1414
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:56,433
Everything is my fault.
Come what may.

1415
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:59,473
You're unconscious!
He'll lynch you!

1416
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:00,590
Too bad.

1417
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:03,997
And then he sees us as a whole.

1418
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:07,033
To him we are all acomplices.

1419
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:10,158
Amir, do something.
I can't take it anymore.

1420
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:12,590
Sepideh, just listen 
for once in your life.

1421
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:16,509
It is more than you and me.
We should all be together.

1422
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:18,236
Ahmad

1423
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:20,159
What do you think?

1424
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:24,315
We tell him.

1425
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:26,148
We say the truth.

1426
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:27,509
Ok.

1427
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:29,519
And you, Manoochehr?

1428
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:32,270
We really didn't know
she was engaged.

1429
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,516
Now we learned too late.

1430
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,188
And you, Shohreh?

1431
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,076
I have not the heart
to lie to this poor boy.

1432
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:46,479
And you, Naazy?

1433
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:49,394
I bow to the majority.

1434
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:52,114
The majority seems to go
for the truth.

1435
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:54,278
We were not aware.

1436
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:55,595
Me, I was.

1437
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,439
But you're alone.
And you just told us a minute ago!

1438
01:40:58,960 --> 01:40:59,836
He is coming.

1439
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:04,280
Come, let's go together.

1440
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:06,274
Peyman, watch out.

1441
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:08,633
And the children? Arash?

1442
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,953
Stay here, Sepideh.
Come Naazy.

1443
01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:15,918
Please don't make the
situation any worse.

1444
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:19,156
What will he think about Elly?

1445
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,035
Arash, Anita,

1446
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:24,633
Morvarid, come quickly.

1447
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:47,350
Ahmad!

1448
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:53,435
Let me see, Ahmad!

1449
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:57,356
Asshole!

1450
01:41:57,560 --> 01:41:59,152
Raise your head.

1451
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:01,149
You are bleeding ...

1452
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:09,469
I can put my hand on the Quran

1453
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:12,638
to swear that we are telling the truth!

1454
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:15,312
On the life of my children!

1455
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:16,635
Dear Sir

1456
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,478
there was no reason to lie to you.

1457
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:20,910
We came here with our families.

1458
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:22,553
We did not organize
a meeting

1459
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:25,115
between your fiance and our friend.

1460
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:26,833
We're not crazy!

1461
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:30,237
If we had had the slightest suspicion,
we would not permit.

1462
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:32,396
What is this discussion?

1463
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:33,828
- Lets go sit down.
- You shut up!

1464
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:35,155
Shut up, asshole!

1465
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,391
- Stop!
- Go back, Ahmad!

1466
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:38,755
That's enough!

1467
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:42,235
We suffer for
two days!

1468
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:44,398
No one has eaten for 2 days!

1469
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:46,155
I ask!

1470
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:49,037
I just want to
be told the truth!

1471
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:52,471
I proposed to call the police.
You will see the report.

1472
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:54,671
To hell with the police.

1473
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,709
We can not lie to the police.
This will be a proof.

1474
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:00,114
I don't want it!

1475
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:01,719
It's the law, sir!

1476
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,036
- Am i talking to you?
- Do you mind!

1477
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:06,470
Come here, Shohreh, come.

1478
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:15,751
Who brought Elly here?

1479
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:19,475
My wife.

1480
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,788
- She know her from the kids school.
- Where is she?

1481
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:24,390
Inside.

1482
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:26,278
I want to talk to her.

1483
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:29,631
She is very ill.

1484
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:31,558
Worse than me?

1485
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:33,630
She sleeps.

1486
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:35,831
We told you already.

1487
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:38,508
I have a question to ask.

1488
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:39,915
We go to the police ...

1489
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:41,838
We'll go, okay.

1490
01:43:42,160 --> 01:43:45,152
- I want to talk ...
- She just fell asleep.

1491
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:49,035
Do not be afraid.
I won't get any worse than this!

1492
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:56,114
Where is she?

1493
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:57,869
Madam!

1494
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:01,115
Wait here.

1495
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:02,589
I'm going.

1496
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:06,031
Shohreh, call Sepideh.

1497
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:11,309
I wanna talk to her alone.

1498
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:14,110
Shohreh!

1499
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:29,155
He is not guy you 
can tell anything to.

1500
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:34,669
He bashed Ahmad.

1501
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:38,037
I say this for your own good.

1502
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:44,273
Please, Sepideh,

1503
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:47,190
Get up.

1504
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:51,034
Go wash your face,
I call him in.

1505
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:52,750
Get up, darling.

1506
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:46,671
It was you who invited her?

1507
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:50,038
Yes, it's me.

1508
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,149
Can I sit down?

1509
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:59,557
When you told her to
come and meet your friend,

1510
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:00,795
she said nothing?

1511
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:08,834
Can I say something,
before?

1512
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:12,030
- Elly ...
- Listen to me.

1513
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:16,752
I just want to know something ...

1514
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:18,195
Sit.

1515
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:24,672
It's yes or no.

1516
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,672
- When she knew ...
- But ...

1517
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,597
... Didn't she say no?

1518
01:46:30,840 --> 01:46:34,469
Didn't she say no?
i can't come, I have a fiance?

1519
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:35,795
Did she?

1520
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,077
Listen, really ...

1521
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:42,755
Really, it ...

1522
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:45,918
For me, it's important.

1523
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:49,874
I gave her three years of my life.

1524
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:52,640
You can sit too?

1525
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:02,158
Didn't she refuse?

1526
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,438
Yes or no?

1527
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:13,794
No, she did not refuse.

1528
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,109
Alireza,

1529
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:09,314
the police called.

1530
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:11,955
They have now found

1531
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:15,994
the body of a woman in water.

1532
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:19,076
You have to go identify her.

1533
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,038
They called the house.

1534
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:28,389
Amir!

1535
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,189
Mr. ...

1536
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:44,594
Wait, we all come with you.

1537
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:55,359
You recognize her?

1538
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:34,713
My condolences.

1539
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,078
I would like my keys.

1540
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:52,875
Will you
tell the family?

1541
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:54,274
Do it yourself.

1542
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:57,715
It would be better if you told them?
