{1814}{1844}My father's land
{1883}{1909}It's beautiful
{1939}{2042}It makes me want to move back for|good, but there'd be a few problems
{2078}{2109}I'll make it

{6110}{6148}one cafe in the docklands.|Alright

{6272}{6312}A really good receptionist
{6316}{6387}keeps an eye on who's who, right?

{15548}{15616}Two hookers are sitting|in a railway carriage
{15668}{15752}Don't laugh at your old dad!|On his birthday, too!

{16013}{16071}- Fine, let's all tell jokes|- Everyone's waiting

{16294}{16390}I can read the papers, my boy.|You're doing well
{16393}{16488}How about that girlfriend|who's always phoning?
{16493}{16562}Can't you give her a kid|and come back here?
{16565}{16612}She's having someone else's kid
{16616}{16702}Then find another girl|and move back here
{16720}{16810}I'm getting older|and I want my family around me
{16842}{16911}- Then there's your mother|- What about her?

{16974}{17033}- I can see why|- What do you mean?
{17038}{17119}What's wrong with my jokes?

{17448}{17470}Christian...

{17780}{17827}- Michael is here|- Michael?
{17846}{17892}I suppose I'll have to talk to him

{18086}{18154}- You're asking the wrong person|- I think so, too

{18326}{18395}{y:i}Today is Helge's birthday!

{18914}{18975}Hi, Christian.|Which room are you in?
{18990}{19048}What? Seventeen. Why?
{19052}{19140}I need to borrow your bath. I mean:|May I borrow your bath, please?
{19301}{19353}{y:i}And the sound of the sea...
{19698}{19736}I'll put them down here
{19746}{19808}- The main course is a secret|- A secret?
{19840}{19904}- You have been hunting today?|- Of course
{20048}{20076}Are you listening?
{20102}{20123}Good
{20138}{20266}It was the third time we were going|to move to Copenhagen, right?
{20318}{20369}But Bettina moved in with him instead
{20377}{20412}- Bettina?|- Yes
{20442}{20541}Anyway, I'm still here, right?|We went to the park yesterday
{20545}{20638}I've been given the room|where my sister died
{20641}{20720}Well, it's better than giving it|to Christian
{20725}{20777}They were twins
{20783}{20852}It's one thing not wanting|to talk about it...
{20856}{20934}but covering it all up is just silly
{20965}{20983}Look...
{21004}{21032}it's spooky
{21074}{21102}Yes, I can see that
{21115}{21151}Like a haunted home
{21156}{21229}I don't think she'd like it either
{21247}{21332}If we take the covers off|and move the furniture a bit...
{21346}{21376}Then I'll stay with her
{21402}{21420}I don't mind at all
{21462}{21508}- Certainly|- OK
{22135}{22190}This is where it happened.|The bathroom
{22300}{22364}Maybe I should have another room
{22368}{22404}Yes, would you rather?
{22434}{22464}It's just that...
{22715}{22766}I'm getting really bad vibes
{22954}{22980}Did you hear that?
{23032}{23068}She's in the bathroom
{23169}{23225}No, she's... she's dead
{23341}{23379}We'll just have a look
{23487}{23531}No, I think we should go
{23543}{23569}No, we must look
{23907}{23963}Hey, Mette, I can't find them
{23972}{24018}Have you checked the suitcases?
{24098}{24128}I can't find my shoes
{24142}{24200}They should be in a suitcase
{24203}{24259}I've looked in that one
{24271}{24338}Keep your shirt on
{24348}{24430}I can't go to dinner in brown shoes.|Dad will go crazy!
{24433}{24515}They must be somewhere
{24518}{24574}I've looked everywhere
{24629}{24664}I think I left them behind
{24668}{24707}You didn't say that. Get it?
{24771}{24860}Go back and get them.|You've got two hours
{24873}{24913}Take the car

{24982}{25051}I can't see my dad in socks
{25054}{25176}You expect me to go home now?|What would your mother and father say?
{25182}{25270}I can't go to dinner in these shoes!
{25278}{25370}- Are you insane?|- You could just pack your own stuff!
{25392}{25456}I've packed for you, me,|and the kids
{25459}{25538}and you want everything|to be just so
{25541}{25660}If you don't like it,|pack your own shit!
{25878}{25935}I've got fucking news for you!
{25950}{26003}You're the one who does the packing!
{26016}{26122}And every single time|you lose my shoes!
{26125}{26250}You're the one who wanted|to visit your fucking parents!
{26321}{26417}I worked for a while at a cake shop
{26465}{26526}Actually, I'm doing the dessert tonight
{26597}{26706}What does it mean? An upward arrow?|Up, up, up?
{26712}{26817}If you lie in the bath, maybe you can|see if there's something there
{26838}{26901}The bath? You want me|to lie in the bath?
{27113}{27143}Shall I lie down?
{27146}{27208}See if you can spot anything
{27211}{27287}A sign or another arrow
{27290}{27384}A wave or a fish or a bird.|Kind of like Getting Warmer
{27443}{27498}- It's just not good enough|- I'm sorry
{27536}{27580}I'd just ironed this
{27583}{27633}I said I was sorry
{27708}{27789}Shall we... shall we lie down|for five minutes?
{27828}{27863}What about the party?
{27918}{28014}We'll just lie down for five minutes,|right?
{28146}{28227}There's a fish!|It means flat, which means down
{28273}{28330}I'm not sure I understand this game
{28363}{28383}Oh dear...
{28416}{28449}How strange!
{28593}{28669}We always played it.|{y:i}Getting Warmer

{29566}{29672}How sweet of her to have done this...|I can hardly bear it
{29805}{29872}I'm the only one still stuck here
{29901}{29962}The rest of you go|swanning off to Paris and...
{29965}{30024}You can't sit here crying
{30033}{30071}I'm sorry
{30194}{30220}Have one of these
{30223}{30283}Just say if you want me to go
{30288}{30319}Didn't you want a bath?
{30377}{30409}An arrow again
{30423}{30460}And another arrow
{30489}{30512}Will you...
{30564}{30602}- Will I what?|- Undo me
{30789}{30878}Look, I've still got a good ass.|Is a bath all it's going to get?

{31974}{32024}- On the other side|- Where?
{32027}{32083}Next to the bulb
{32331}{32417}To whoever finds this letter.|You are probably...
{33134}{33219}- Bloody hell!|- It doesn't say anything
{33342}{33382}Mette, damn it!

{34299}{34316}A bit?
{34336}{34385}I'm sorry.|Thanks for your help

{35472}{35532}You can't even be bothered|to look at a pretty girl any more
{35570}{35621}Maybe you think I'm too skinny
{35651}{35674}Christian?
{35967}{36064}I'll put it in here.|They mustn't find it...
{36252}{36273}Done

{38862}{38879}Hi, Dad
{38903}{38998}Later, my boy... we're going in now
{39006}{39028}It's about...
{39070}{39172}I've been asked to inquire whether you|are interested in the Lodge
{39202}{39292}I don't see you as one|of the brethren, I must say
{39304}{39380}But Christian has told Preben|you're doing well
{39383}{39433}And as Christian is not interested
{39438}{39545}you may expect to be invited|to join the Freemasons
{39557}{39636}Strike while the iron is hot.|This may be your only...
{39646}{39713}{y:i}He could make something of himself...

{40556}{40586}Go on, move!
{40602}{40626}Have you got a drink?
{40782}{40818}We need to talk
{40862}{40892}I can't right now
{41916}{41963}You do remember something,|don't you?
{41984}{42056}- Yes, certainly|- Jolly good
{42147}{42248}I was thinking of saying|a word or two this evening
{42259}{42291}I thought as much
{42315}{42378}It won't be anything|fit for little girls
{42399}{42430}I bet it won't
{42445}{42481}You fell asleep
{42603}{42640}Aren't you sleeping properly?
{42692}{42720}Only with you
{43056}{43136}It's a great honour for me to act|as toastmaster this evening
{43139}{43252}for the Klingenfeldt-Hansen family
{43297}{43386}My name is Helmuth von Sachs
{43390}{43482}Yes, I am from Deutschland|Cologne, the Ruhr, the steelworks
{43561}{43626}And also Helge is a man of steel.|Still going strong
{43687}{43787}Helge, mein Freund,|mein danishes Vater,
{43801}{43831}over to you
{44136}{44253}Seeing you all reminds me|so clearly of the years gone by...
{44279}{44358}and of all that's happened to us
{44438}{44518}There's nothing special about|turning sixty
{44542}{44582}It's not a big deal
{44629}{44749}It seems like yesterday when we|concluded the final negotiations
{44777}{44853}for the take-over of this unique place
{44877}{44941}Yet it was way back
{44953}{45006}in the summer of 1971
{45060}{45166}when my young family walked up|these steps
{45218}{45254}My dear wife,
{45274}{45299}Helene,
{45326}{45348}Michael,
{45375}{45403}and the twins...
{45475}{45498}The twins...
{45592}{45701}Ready to move into|this beautiful estate
{45719}{45743}We were so...
{45839}{45891}We were so full of expectations
{45948}{45995}I'll stop there
{46004}{46097}I'll stop there and hope that|we will have a lovely party together
{46100}{46140}Let's eat!
{46358}{46393}First course. Ready...
{46431}{46450}Go!
{46611}{46632}Over and out
{46893}{46988}- Did you enjoy the drive?|- No, it was very hot in the car
{46991}{47046}You've got air conditioning, Bent
{47049}{47140}Yes, but it dries your mouth up
{47143}{47215}- It really is most unpleasant|- Really?
{47243}{47285}The kids are here too
{47393}{47415}Give me some water!
{47419}{47471}May I have some water, please?
{48225}{48328}I'm all wet...
{48414}{48510}- What's your name, lass?|- My name is Mette
{48543}{48615}- M. E. T. T. E. Mette|- That's right, yes, Mette
{48695}{48773}I said it's lobster soup...|Iovely!
{48788}{48822}No, it's salmon soup
{48825}{48859}Salmon?
{48902}{48952}I think it tends more towards lobster
{48957}{49063}- It's delicious, this soup|- Yes. Tomato soup
{49108}{49201}No, definitely not tomato.|It's lobster soup
{49212}{49261}- Yes|- Yes, lobster soup... cheers!
{49440}{49500}Eldest son's speech...|Ready, Morten?
{49517}{49574}{y:i}It's nearly seven o'clock and
{49583}{49682}I should like to propose the first toast,|it being my duty as the eldest son
{49686}{49734}- Correct, Helmuth?|- Absolutely
{49775}{49828}But first, a speech
{49840}{49903}I've written two, Father
{49934}{50009}One is green, the other is yellow.|You choose
{50087}{50173}- Green? Yellow?|- I'll take the green
{50194}{50295}The green is an interesting choice,|it's a kind of home truth speech
{50313}{50393}I've called it When Dad had his bath
{50480}{50585}I was very young|when we moved here
{50595}{50683}Things changed completely for us
{50709}{50771}We had all the space we wanted
{50774}{50855}and we filled it with as much trouble|as we could cause
{50859}{50909}This room was a restaurant then
{50913}{51028}I can't count the times|my sister Linda, who is now dead
{51040}{51128}and I played in here
{51132}{51238}She would put things in people's|food without their noticing
{51283}{51386}{y:i}We would hide and watch.|{y:i}Then she would begin to laugh
{51407}{51507}She had the most infectious|laugh you can imagine
{51511}{51610}In no time at all we'd both be howling|with laughter and we'd get caught
{51649}{51710}But nothing ever happened to us
{51713}{51759}It was much more dangerous
{51763}{51827}when Dad had his bath
{51877}{51993}I don't know if you remember,|but Dad was always having baths
{52009}{52065}He'd take Linda and me|into the study...
{52074}{52138}as there was something|he had to do first
{52146}{52264}Then he'd lock the door|and roll down the blinds
{52275}{52383}Then he'd take his shirt off and|his trousers and make us do likewise
{52401}{52503}He'd lie us across the green|couch that's been thrown out now...
{52515}{52631}and abuse us sexually. He raped us.|Had sex with his little ones
{52670}{52694}Christian!
{52703}{52788}A couple of months ago,|when my sister died
{52791}{52866}I realised that Helge was|a very clean man, with all those baths
{52877}{52972}I thought I'd share it|with the rest of the family
{53006}{53084}Baths. Summer, winter, spring,|autumn, morning, evening...
{53090}{53134}Really, Helge's a very clean man
{53141}{53258}I just wanted you to know that seeing|as we're celebrating his sixtieth
{53280}{53306}What a guy!
{53318}{53408}Lmagine living a long life and|watching your children grow up!
{53413}{53467}And grandchildren!
{53471}{53539}But you didn't come to listen to me
{53556}{53676}We've come to celebrate|Helge's sixtieth, so let's do so
{53685}{53768}Thank you for all those|wonderful years
{53809}{53836}Happy Birthday!
{54076}{54141}I have nothing to drink.|Fill our glasses!
{54550}{54641}Christian, you were the first
{54653}{54704}but now it's my turn
{54750}{54826}Elsie, it is your birthday
{54854}{54884}It's Helge's!
{54905}{54926}What did he say?
{54929}{54999}He said it's Helge's birthday, Grandad
{55053}{55115}Helge, it's your birthday,|and that's good
{55132}{55240}You're a big boy now.|Your ears can take a story
{55244}{55304}from across the seven seas
{55374}{55395}Nice one, Grandad!
{55426}{55461}I have to go
{55464}{55527}When Helge was a young lad
{55536}{55633}he told me he had trouble|finding ladyfriends
{55963}{55995}- Hello, Christian|- Kim...
{56006}{56062}I've got a plane to catch
{56084}{56114}Stop, everybody!
{56117}{56186}May I introduce my boyhood buddy,|Christian
{56190}{56249}You know most of them
{56297}{56330}Christian, how are you?
{56370}{56422}- I'm fine|- You're fine?
{56473}{56505}Well done, Christian
{56516}{56578}You've made your speech and|now you're going home
{56596}{56670}The battle's lost.|Nothing's changed
{56675}{56690}Over
{56724}{56750}Are you drunk?
{56754}{56797}How else could I cook?
{56801}{56880}- How long have we known each other?|- A long time
{56884}{56912}Since Year One?
{56951}{56987}We scrumped apples together
{57033}{57126}I've been waiting for this ever since,|and you just run away
{57158}{57251}From your father, who drew lots|for you and your sister
{57292}{57388}A brilliant start to your speech.|Drawing lots like your father
{57406}{57439}What do you want, Kim?
{57545}{57581}Sorry to interrupt, Grandad
{57593}{57720}I just want to say that I hope none|of you took Christian seriously
{57726}{57826}He is my brother and I love him dearly
{57839}{57944}But what he said wasn't true.|And I should know, right?
{57955}{58025}Sorry for interrupting.|I'm a little shocked
{58070}{58169}At 7.15 your father'll come down to|give me a time for the main course
{58194}{58288}I think they like the food,|he'll say, as usual
{58302}{58351}And he'll have his usual glass
{58393}{58434}Just give me two minutes
{59098}{59138}I thought you'd gone
{59160}{59179}Come here!
{59207}{59249}Bring a schnapps for me and my son
{59265}{59352}- That was splendid|- Thank you
{59387}{59423}I think they like the food
{59471}{59492}Have some schnapps
{59505}{59542}- No, thanks|- Really?
{59628}{59689}That tastes good.|Damned good!
{59709}{59750}I do believe it's damned good
{59786}{59818}Have one yourself
{59823}{59880}Come with me
{59896}{59919}Alone
{59946}{59970}Off we go!
{60198}{60226}Well, how are you?
{60251}{60269}I'm fine
{60296}{60314}Are you?
{60388}{60412}Are you sure?
{60467}{60517}Well, I don't understand this
{60557}{60624}My memory must be failing me.|Age, probably
{60648}{60670}What do you mean?
{60678}{60735}What you talked about
{60744}{60816}I don't recall any of it.|You'll have to help me
{60852}{60880}What happened exactly?
{61025}{61138}Sorry it's probably me|who got it wrong
{61150}{61226}Don't apologise|or you'll really have me worried
{61230}{61326}I'm just a bit stressed out at the|moment with work...
{61337}{61367}and my sister
{61384}{61408}Forget it
{61451}{61569}What you were telling us is a crime.|I think we should call the police
{61579}{61635}No, don't do that
{61646}{61684}Just forget it
{61709}{61829}I'm not sleeping well.|I'm feeling a bit weird. Sorry
{61832}{61873}Are things going well upstairs?
{61882}{61951}Yes, fine, fine
{61955}{62017}It takes more than that to shake them
{62107}{62161}Have a good trip home.|It was nice seeing you
{62173}{62206}They're waiting for me
{62863}{62942}- Helge, it's your birthday|- Grandad, not again!
{62960}{63028}You're a big boy now
{63039}{63153}Your ears can take a story|from across the seven seas
{63234}{63331}When Helge was a young lad
{63343}{63456}he told me he had trouble|finding ladyfriends
{63506}{63570}I told him, Listen, lad!
{63578}{63701}Just buy a big potato and stuff it|down your swimming trunks
{63705}{63818}Go down to the lake and|they'll come running!
{63844}{63886}Anyway, summer came...
{63932}{63989}- What do you think?|- Me?
{64027}{64076}I don't know what he's planning
{64211}{64326}He came back in despair and|told me things were far worse now
{64338}{64392}Nobody would talk to him
{64401}{64482}No wonder, I said. You should|have put the potato
{64497}{64565}down the front of your trunks
{64666}{64773}{y:i}For he's a jolly good fellow!
{64935}{64954}Michelle!
{64978}{64994}Pia!
{65008}{65034}A word
{65067}{65138}Michelle come here, Pia come here.|A word
{65215}{65261}We'll steal their car keys.|Over
{65271}{65290}- What?|- Us?
{65322}{65444}It's Christian's turn tonight.|People mustn't go home yet. Over
{65460}{65549}I don't think he intends to say|any more. He apologised
{65556}{65634}Let's wait and see.|Don't tell the old waiters
{65637}{65682}They need their pensions
{65687}{65719}Off you go. Now!
{65840}{65875}We musn't leave any traces
{65879}{65949}No, no, we'll be careful
{66048}{66060}I've got it!
{66105}{66119}Next room
{66156}{66180}Is everything OK?
{66290}{66326}There aren't any problems?
{66344}{66402}No, no. Everything is OK
{66487}{66531}Is my brother staying the night?
{66549}{66583}I don't really know
{66761}{66783}A taxi?
{66792}{66819}I'll check it out
{67069}{67160}Hey, Charlie Brown!|You've come to the wrong place
{67384}{67413}Can I go?
{67417}{67448}Just a moment
{68013}{68099}Listen, Sambo. I don't know where|you met my sister...
{68332}{68386}- Michael, what are you doing?|- What the hell do you mean?
{68511}{68552}What the hell are you doing?
{68559}{68620}Mind your fucking manners!
{68624}{68752}How dare you drag some monkey|to Dad's party?
{68756}{68840}Are you calling Gbatokai a monkey?|How dare you? - Chill out
{68904}{68955}You Nazi bastard!
{69210}{69238}OK. Push off!
{69620}{69709}Mum, hang on.|This is my boyfriend, Gbatokai
{69845}{69917}Mum, you haven't met him before.|That was someone else
{70435}{70532}Forgive me for disturbing you again.|But I forgot the most important bit
{70546}{70651}We're here for my father's birthday,|not anything else
{70655}{70778}If I led you up the wrong track|earlier, I'd like to make amends
{70791}{70851}by proposing a toast to my father
{70855}{70941}- Please stand|- Well done, Christian
{71070}{71104}Raise your glasses!
{71242}{71329}Here's to the man who killed|my sister. To a murderer
{71443}{71486}I'd like to propose an interval
{71650}{71711}Cigarettes! Quick!
{71939}{71972}Play something
{71976}{72006}Nice and quiet
{72062}{72076}Play something
{72117}{72195}No, let's stay a while.|We can't just leave
{72500}{72536}Christian, are you crazy?
{72612}{72652}Christian, can you hear me?
{72684}{72721}Are you crazy, Christian?
{72820}{72869}Make sure nobody goes home
{72893}{72940}He's sick... sick, damn it!
{73079}{73145}For the last time!|I have phoned...
{73149}{73208}- Get me a taxi|- Just a moment
{73283}{73334}I can't take it.|I already suffer from depression
{73339}{73399}We can't leave!|There are no taxis here
{73402}{73441}- Fine, then I'll walk|- Alright, let's walk!
{73444}{73532}Here comes the Danish summer.|I've had it with these gatherings
{73536}{73597}- Bent, have you seen the car keys?|- No, I haven't
{73658}{73734}We're leaving|but I can't find our car keys
{73743}{73798}- Problems?|- I can't take it
{73880}{73946}The number you're calling|is still engaged
{73950}{74057}{y:i}- There is an eleven month wait|- May I speak to Kim?
{74092}{74159}Lars, just take it easy, OK?
{74186}{74211}Hide those car keys!
{74222}{74254}In the oven
{74342}{74378}In the fridge
{74473}{74493}All gone!
{74509}{74540}Where the hell is Michelle?
{74640}{74675}Come in, damn it
{74695}{74762}Michael, I want a word|with you, too
{74793}{74807}You must leave
{74811}{74850}No. We're going to talk now
{74860}{74941}- Mette, you must hear that too|- We're going to talk, come on!
{75057}{75084}In here. Come on
{75098}{75156}- Let go of me|- Calm down, alright?
{75175}{75243}- OK, what do you want?|- Last year...
{75247}{75372}You came on to me and now|you won't even give me the time of day
{75399}{75489}I'm sorry, right?|Damn it...
{75493}{75533}I've got my wife here
{75536}{75621}It's funny, she's never|been that important before
{75635}{75679}You know I got pregnant?
{75697}{75803}Don't worry, I got rid of it.|I just thought you should know
{75834}{75949}Listen, it's my old man's 60th|and things are going crazy
{76075}{76158}Hi, Bent. Bloody hell.|Is this your room?
{76169}{76222}I was just leaving.|Seen my car keys?
{76265}{76304}I'll have a quick look, OK?
{76381}{76414}Sure you haven't seen them?
{76458}{76516}I'll get really depressed|if I don't find them
{76519}{76597}I know, I know.|Bent, run along downstairs
{76691}{76786}Pack up your stuff|and get out, right?
{76790}{76879}Here's your wages.|Now just fuck off, understand?
{76939}{77004}You're as fucked up as your Dad
{77291}{77346}Don't ever talk about my family!
{78084}{78149}What if I got up and said|a couple of words instead?
{78186}{78218}About you?
{78230}{78298}About how sick you were as a child?
{78332}{78420}About the way you always spoiled|things for the other children?
{78423}{78492}Making them watch as you burnt|their toys
{78496}{78562}The warped character|you've always been?
{78606}{78683}About how we had to go to France
{78689}{78798}to rescue you from that sanatorium|where you lay
{78803}{78859}sick in the head,|as ever, pumped full of drugs
{78902}{78945}to your mother's despair
{78970}{79034}I could also mention|your lack of talent with women
{79037}{79083}Lovely women
{79087}{79130}you let go by, year after year
{79133}{79226}because there is so little man in you.|Christian
{79240}{79347}I could also make a speech|about you and your sister
{79361}{79398}What do you say to that?
{79453}{79535}Did she ever say goodbye to you?
{79619}{79701}No. Was there a card? A letter?|No. Nothing
{79714}{79757}There was for the rest of us
{79761}{79814}And maybe there was a reason why
{79849}{79903}Because you just left
{79916}{79945}as usual
{79975}{80024}Abandoned your sick sister
{80076}{80125}She kept asking for you
{80128}{80255}Rushing to the phone every|time it rang. But it was never you
{80259}{80363}As ever, you were only interested|in yourself and your sick mind
{80366}{80481}Now you sling mud at the family that|only ever wanted the best for you
{80528}{80598}Your mother wants you to go|and never come back
{80615}{80675}But I think you should stay right here
{80696}{80798}Feel what it means|to spit in your family's face
{80946}{80975}After...
{80989}{81078}After that little intermezzo pianissimo
{81081}{81147}I think we should return|to the dinner table
{81157}{81186}Ich haber Hunger|Ladies and gentlemen...
{81601}{81672}They're back!|Christian isn't very happy
{81678}{81751}Right! Venison and cranberry, go!
{82035}{82064}Cheers, Grandad!
{82172}{82240}It was a superduper speech
{82296}{82365}You keep yelling into my ear
{82643}{82681}Grandad, cheers again
{83181}{83224}Salt and pepper! Cheers!
{83230}{83311}Champagne! We must have|Champagne! And caviar!
{85505}{85572}If the birthday boy|is my danishes Vater,
{85579}{85658}Elsie is my danishes Mutter
{85685}{85732}Everyone's Mother!
{85747}{85788}Elsie, over to you
{85793}{85829}Give her a hand!
{85974}{86058}Thank you, Helmuth. Thank you all
{86073}{86165}I want to say how much|I appreciate
{86188}{86242}your coming today
{86270}{86351}I also want to say a word or two
{86358}{86451}to thank my husband, my Helge
{86476}{86526}Though it may be hard to find the words
{86529}{86600}to describe what you have meant
{86604}{86641}and still mean to me
{86672}{86733}But with your appetite for life
{86747}{86813}and infinite love for your family,
{86830}{86943}you have given me everything|a wife could wish for
{86969}{87066}We've had thirty wonderful years.|Thank you!
{87132}{87268}I think I'll take the opportunity to|say a word or two to my children
{87369}{87486}I think it is fantastic to see|how well you have done,
{87499}{87593}especially when I consider|how little you once were
{87657}{87678}Michael,
{87702}{87779}You are our youngest,|our little baby
{87805}{87858}Not that we've seen that much of you
{87869}{87957}You were away from home from|an early age
{87965}{88016}First, boarding school
{88036}{88086}Then away at sea
{88100}{88169}Then catering college in Switzerland
{88201}{88260}You never became a chef
{88268}{88321}but who knows?
{88345}{88487}At any rate you have given us|three splendid grandchildren
{88508}{88584}for whom your father and I|are so grateful
{88607}{88699}And of course|we thank your little Mette
{88736}{88826}Helene, the family loner
{88858}{88896}You really are, Helene
{88899}{89029}Ever since you informed us that you'd|decided to become a singer
{89034}{89152}and had joined the Trotsk...|the Young Socialists, I think it was...
{89169}{89242}We always knew you would|choose your own path
{89245}{89316}And you certainly have
{89324}{89389}In life as well as your studies
{89412}{89488}You've ended up in anthropology
{89496}{89600}Most interesting. Though your father|and I always hoped you'd chose Law
{89669}{89800}But goodness, I can't begin to count|the number of foreign countries
{89803}{89934}and their unfortunate inhabitants|with whom you've had contacts
{89946}{89983}Speaking of which,
{89997}{90078}I'd like to extend a warm welcome|to Gonzales
{90085}{90134}Mummy, his name is Gbatokai
{90242}{90275}Welcome, Kai!
{90326}{90402}Then there is you, Christian
{90426}{90489}You have always been quite special
{90529}{90574}A creative child
{90598}{90665}The stories Christian could tell|when he was small!
{90672}{90813}I always thought you'd make|a really good author one day
{90857}{90904}When Christian was small,|for all of you who don't know,
{90962}{91062}he had a loyal companion|called Snoot
{91093}{91138}who didn't exist
{91172}{91266}But Snoot and Christian|were inseparable
{91281}{91368}If Snoot didn't like something,|neither did Christian
{91375}{91441}If you were the one|at the receiving end,
{91444}{91508}there was nothing|you could do about it
{91526}{91562}But dear Christian...
{91580}{91701}It is so important to be able|to distinguish fact from fiction
{91722}{91803}I think you've always|had trouble doing so
{91828}{91920}Of course you can be angry|with your father
{91927}{91987}I am sometimes, too
{92008}{92090}But it has to be sorted out|in private
{92097}{92187}Telling stories like those you've|told this evening
{92190}{92274}however exciting they may be...|and they were exciting...
{92288}{92350}is going a bit too far
{92403}{92496}Christian, I think that Snoot|has been with you today
{92517}{92591}and I think you both rather upset|your father
{92608}{92683}So I think it would be appropriate|if you stood up,
{92713}{92756}leaving Snoot in his seat,
{92767}{92817}and gave your father an apology
{92837}{92924}It won't belittle you in any way|to say you're sorry
{92948}{92989}It would be quite alright
{93087}{93140}Christian, you may stand up now
{93227}{93307}Come on, Christian.|Get your fucking act together!
{93338}{93411}- He's sick in the head, Mum|- Christian?
{94181}{94223}I'm sorry to disturb you again
{94261}{94352}In 1974 you, my mother,|came into the study
{94355}{94449}to see your son on all fours|and your husband with no pants on
{94459}{94537}I'm sorry you saw me like that
{94541}{94619}Yet you left the room when your|husband ordered you out
{94623}{94730}I'm sorry you're so hypocritical|and corrupt that I hope you die
{94733}{94785}I'm sorry that you're all such cunts
{94789}{94835}that you believe her
{94847}{94913}I'm sorry that for thirty years,|Your husband
{94978}{95015}Let me finish!
{95043}{95074}I haven't finished!
{95088}{95169}Christian, cool it.|Come on. Out!
{95220}{95285}- I want my coat|- You can have your coat
{95467}{95561}You were away at boarding school.|What the fuck do you know?
{95565}{95602}But you know anyway!
{95606}{95669}- You're way out of line!|- You know anyway!
{95673}{95732}- Don't you?|- You've gone too far!
{95830}{95861}Out of my way!
{95930}{95956}Lock the door!
{96010}{96031}Is it locked?
{96049}{96076}I think so
{96437}{96531}{y:i}In the deep, deep forest peace
{96567}{96638}{y:i}Ehere songsters dwell
{96714}{96815}{y:i}Ehere my soul did hearken|{y:i}many a time
{96902}{96977}{y:i}To the birds'happy song
{97157}{97238}Where was I?
{97244}{97291}Mother, my loyal witness!|In 1974 you entered the study...
{97295}{97428}and saw my father's stiff dick|rubbing my hair - You bastard!
{97556}{97577}You bastard!
{97673}{97701}He is not well
{97731}{97761}It's very sad...
{97768}{97802}Mother, please continue
{97840}{97989}{y:i}There is such an idyll, such peace|{y:i}and calm in the sylvan solitude
{98028}{98096}{y:i}That all sorrows are stilled
{98131}{98221}{y:i}Ehere peace and rest do reign
{98408}{98452}Get out of here, you bastard!
{98469}{98508}Fuck off!
{98570}{98632}Leif, stop that, damn it!|He's my brother
{99082}{99109}Christian, come here!
{99157}{99218}The game's over, get it?
{99505}{99575}Have you had enough, man?
{99608}{99644}Not that! He's my brother
{99682}{99723}- Come on, get rid of him|- Where?
{99726}{99809}- In the woods|- We've got to stop this shit!
{99904}{99946}- How far?|- Just get rid of him
{99985}{100065}- What do you mean, get rid of him?|- Shut up! Over here
{100142}{100186}We'll leave him by that tree
{100246}{100306}That's the way.|Come on
{100480}{100549}Do we really have to tie you|to a tree, Christian?
{100613}{100697}What the hell|made you talk such shit?
{101157}{101226}- Is he tied up?|- I'm through now
{101263}{101292}Calm down now
{101316}{101344}Easy does it
{101378}{101404}Take it easy, Christian
{101924}{101995}Leif, have you got a cigarette?|I dropped mine
{102050}{102105}I'll check all the doors
{102233}{102267}I don't want to talk to him
{102289}{102329}What have you done to him?
{102355}{102388}Relax
{102407}{102492}I talked to him. He's gone home.|He's very sorry
{102505}{102565}So let's take it easy.|We'll talk about it later
{102693}{102718}You want trouble?
{102828}{102883}Stop it, Michael!|Michael, stop it!
{103111}{103153}That's enough!|Back off!
{103319}{103355}- Hi there, Kim|- Hi, Leif
{103379}{103427}We need to lock the back door
{103448}{103513}- Where is it?|- Right over here
{103597}{103645}- A bad business|- Yes
{103668}{103712}You didn't kill him, or anything?
{103725}{103764}He won't be back
{103789}{103830}- This way?|- In here
{103833}{103886}- This is the wine cellar.|- Yes. Over
{103986}{104019}Cut it out, Kim
{104052}{104080}What the hell is this?
{104097}{104137}- You locked him in?|- Yes
{104158}{104206}We can't have his type|running around
{104342}{104370}Hands off!
{104374}{104446}- Kim, where's Christian?|- No idea
{104945}{104987}Stop drinking, Michael
{105291}{105317}What did you say?
{105359}{105413}Why don't you make a speech?
{105590}{105669}Right, let's get things swinging!|A little sing-song
{105692}{105783}{y:i}I saw a real Black Sambo
{105804}{105865}{y:i}His face was black as pitch
{105904}{105974}{y:i}He spoke all funny
{105982}{106069}{y:i}And had a ring in his nose
{106077}{106170}{y:i}I asked him: Ehat are you?
{106186}{106269}{y:i}Ehy are your legs covered in tar?
{106277}{106366}{y:i}Hejust laughed and said:|{y:i}Tomrassi gassi bom!
{106635}{106720}{y:i}I saw a little Indian
{106723}{106816}{y:i}His face was as red as fire|{y:i}He spoke all funny
{106894}{106972}I can't stand this!|They'll kill each other!
{106989}{107036}I'm going crazy!
{107232}{107272}I've got such a headache
{107275}{107337}Will you get my tablets?
{107478}{107542}- Have you seen Christian?|- No, he's gone home
{107549}{107617}It's for the best
{107662}{107703}I'll get your tablets
{108102}{108145}You're all crazy
{110769}{110834}- You're still capable...|- Oh yes
{110844}{110896}For longer than you think, Helge
{110937}{110995}It's nearly 10 o'clock
{111018}{111092}and something exciting|is about to happen
{111465}{111570}As Alfred Hitchcock suggested|for his gravestone:
{111582}{111663}This is what happens|to naughty little boys
{111678}{111801}Helge, you're not getting|out of the family tradition
{111807}{111842}The grand finale!
{111947}{112039}{y:i}It's Daddy's birthday!|{y:i}It really is today
{112063}{112133}{y:i}Daddy's birthday today!
{112139}{112233}{y:i}Now listen to the way|{y:i}we blow the trumpet!
{112522}{112601}{y:i}It's Daddy's birthday today!
{112627}{112700}{y:i}Listen to the way|{y:i}we play the flute!
{113269}{113355}You dropped something!|You should be more careful
{113547}{113618}Helene... you're not going already?|So soon?
{113641}{113727}- I want to go home now|- Don't be silly
{113731}{113787}It's time for dessert
{114678}{114778}I love these family traditions
{114788}{114892}After the dance around the house|a note appears
{114897}{114931}on the toastmaster's glass
{114934}{115000}and here is what it says:
{115065}{115208}A certain man urges his sister|to read letter to his father A letter
{115256}{115382}I think Helene is too shy.|Right, Helene?
{115457}{115493}In any case...
{115509}{115645}it is kind of your brother|to help you get started
{115692}{115785}And it seems that there|is peace in the family again
{115824}{115937}So let's give Helene a hand
{116196}{116251}- Come on|- Come on, Helene
{116415}{116451}Don't be shy!
{116686}{116728}Michael, ignore him!
{116863}{116885}It's...
{116981}{117003}It's from my sister
{117115}{117166}To whoever finds this letter...
{117232}{117303}You are probably my sister|or one of my brothers
{117336}{117423}Because you can play|{y:i}Getting Warmer
{117431}{117467}Nudge, nudge!
{117510}{117614}I know you will be sad to find me
{117628}{117689}in a bath full of water
{117847}{117894}But it isn't so sad for me
{118051}{118117}I know my brothers and sister
{118138}{118218}are happy, radiant people,
{118265}{118340}and that I love you
{118411}{118475}And I think you should|just forget me
{118562}{118630}Christian, my beloved!
{118655}{118739}Who has always been with me!|Thank you for everything
{118777}{118886}I don't want to mix you up in this.|I love you too much for that
{118897}{118981}And you, Helene.|And you, Michael, of course
{118989}{119020}You nutter
{119257}{119307}Dad has begun having me again
{119318}{119411}In my dreams, anyway.|And I can't bear any more
{119523}{119556}I'm going away now
{119572}{119650}As I probably always|should have done
{119688}{119777}I know it will fill your life|with darkness, Christian
{119856}{119894}I have tried to ring you,
{119927}{119968}but I know you're busy
{120013}{120107}I just want to tell you|not to be sad
{120197}{120277}I think there is light and beauty|on the other side
{120330}{120447}In fact, I'm looking forward to it.|Although, of course, I am a bit afraid
{120531}{120583}Afraid of leaving without you
{120681}{120725}I will love you forever
{120788}{120811}Linda
{121127}{121157}Lovely letter
{121163}{121262}Pour my daughter some port,|so that I can drink a toast with her

{121976}{122014}I've never seen the like
{122076}{122109}What are you staring at?
{122173}{122254}Is it my fault that I have such|talentless offspring?
{122314}{122426}I've just never really understood|why you did it
{122436}{122476}It was all you were good for
{123468}{123549}It's been quite a job|being toastmaster tonight
{123604}{123683}I must admit|I hadn't tried it before
{123702}{123781}I am profoundly affected|by the situation
