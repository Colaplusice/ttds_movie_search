1
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Check, please.

2
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,320
Look, Daddy,
a volcano.

3
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,400
It's very pretty.
Now drink up your volcano.

4
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,480
All right. We're going.
Mommy's waiting.

5
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,520
Daddy, please.
Just one more minute.

6
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,640
No. We're going.

7
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,960
Until I ended up
flatlining at the hospital.

8
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,760
But I survived. And instead
of letting that scare me,

9
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,040
I kept on going.

10
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,960
Until...

11
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,240
my first daughter
was born.

12
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,400
And now,
I look at my girls...

13
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,440
and my husband,

14
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,440
who has been standing
by me for so long.

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,520
Think which one
you're gonna pull out.

16
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,960
I always think, man.
No, you don't.

17
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,520
They didn't lock you up this time
'cause you're not 18 yet.

18
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,600
Next time, they're gonna
lock you up, brother.

19
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,920
Come on.

20
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,560
Well, you're not thinkin'.

21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,080
Stealing might get you money,

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,160
you can tap
some cheerleader's ass,

23
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,680
you can show off riding
in some pickle-colored Thunderbird,

24
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,800
but tell me what's gonna happen if you
shoot a pregnant woman or an old man?

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,000
You know what'll happen?

26
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,880
The guilt will suck you
down to the bone.

27
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,440
Stealing ain't worth it.

28
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,120
Going to church,
reading the Bible...

29
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,000
and believing in Jesus, brother,
that's your ticket.

30
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,040
You think it's a fantasy, right?

31
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,880
Come here, man.
Get up. Come here.

32
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,120
See that truck? Beauty, isn't it?

33
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,800
I won it at a friend's raffle.

34
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,280
No shit. You know what?

35
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,760
It wasn't luck. It was Jesus
who wanted me to have that truck.

36
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,080
That's bullshit.
I bet you stole it.

37
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,240
Jesus gave me that truck.

38
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,440
And as He who gives
and He who takes away.

39
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,680
Right. He doesn't
give a shit about us.

40
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,120
Come back.

41
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,840
Take off the hat.

42
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,800
God even knows when a single
hair moves on your head.

43
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,600
You're wrong, Nick.

44
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,280
So, this is death's waiting room.

45
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,240
These ridiculous tubes.

46
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,400
These needles swelling my arms.

47
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,840
What am I doing
in this pre-corpse club?

48
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,320
What do I have to
do with them?

49
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,720
<i>I don't know when
anything began anymore... </i>

50
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,080
or when it's gonna end.

51
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,040
Who will be the first
to lose his life?

52
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,360
He, in the coma?

53
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,640
Or me?

54
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,920
All right.
You can get dressed now.

55
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,080
<i>Your Fallopian tubes
are severely damaged. </i>

56
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,320
<i>It looks like you had
some kind of an infection... </i>

57
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,240
<i>that wasn't taken
care of properly. </i>

58
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,960
We can try surgery, but I
have to tell you, I think,

59
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,400
the probabilities
are pretty slim.

60
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,680
Look.

61
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,560
Excuse me for asking this, but it's
important that you tell me the truth.

62
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,800
<i>Have you ever
had an abortion?</i>

63
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,200
<i>Yes.
Any reason?</i>

64
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,600
I had already separated from
my husband when I got pregnant,

65
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,280
and I...
No. I meant a medical reason.

66
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,840
<i>My husband's dying.
I'm sorry?</i>

67
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,960
Paul, my husband,
he's dying,

68
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,240
and I want to have his baby.

69
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,240
<i>We can operate then and hope you get pregnant
within three or four months. </i>

70
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,240
He's got one month left,
at most.

71
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,560
How'd it go?
Not good, Reverend.

72
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,680
<i>In one ear,
out the other. </i>

73
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,000
Be patient. All it takes is one
sheep in a thousand, Jack. Come on.

74
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,320
Afternoon, Reverend. Hey, Wolf, you still
having that birthday party Wednesday?

75
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,640
My place, brother.
Cool.

76
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,960
I may be late, Jack.
I have Bible class on Wednesday.

77
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,120
What the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

78
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,680
- I will hurt you, boy.
- Paul. Paul!

79
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,920
Back off.

80
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,960
I told you to think.
Fuck you!

81
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,360
Hit me!

82
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,280
Come on!

83
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,680
Leave it, Jack.
He's a kid, Jack.

84
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,000
- He's a punk, Reverend.
- No, he's a kid.

85
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,600
<i>You think, Jack. </i>

86
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,400
<i>Those who are making decisions
that affect our life,</i>

87
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,120
<i>we must call out to God
to give them His wisdom. </i>

88
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,040
Daddy's home.
I'll see you tomorrow, Tam.

89
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,320
I'll pick the boys up after school
if you want me to.

90
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
How's my queen?

91
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,640
<i>And Hercules.
You don't have a queen. </i>

92
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,560
Freddy, help me out.

93
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,480
I got the cooler from the
religious center. Good.

94
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,600
- Dad, are we gonna go buy a dog now?
- Help me out.

95
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,240
Freddy, we agreed no dogs.
Grab the other handle. Lift it up.

96
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,160
You said if I got good grades,
you'd buy me one.

97
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,600
Your sister has allergies,
and dog hair is bad for her.

98
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,000
Bad for her, not me.
Get me a dog.

99
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,520
Freddy, leave it alone. Well,
at least get me a hamster.

100
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,000
Well, we'll see.
We'll see.

101
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,160
You always say
you promise.

102
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,920
<i>You back, motherfucker?</i>

103
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,560
Lock down six!

104
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,080
Six down!

105
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,120
I win.

106
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,560
Age before beauty.

107
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,840
You're such
a sore loser.

108
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,320
Do you wanna go to the
Jacuzzi for a while? Shit.

109
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,000
No, I can't. Michael and the
girls are waiting for me already.

110
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,920
Well, call me later.

111
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,880
I'll call ya.

112
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,640
Cristina?

113
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,800
<i>And you get away from leading
your family like a man of God... </i>

114
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,400
ought to lead his family
in prayer...

115
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,080
and reading the word of God
and the things of God...

116
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,320
<i>and bringing them to the
house of God,  Amen. </i>

117
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,280
Then you're opening the door for the
devil to come in and slay your family.

118
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,000
<i>Amen.
 Jesus is our light. </i>

119
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,560
Jesus is our light.
Jesus is our hope.

120
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,720
Jesus is our hope.
Jesus is our forgiveness.

121
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,240
<i> Jesus is the water
that quenches my thirst. </i>

122
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,960
Jesus is the water
that quenches my thirst.

123
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,640
<i>If you're saved
and you know it, say "Amen. "</i>

124
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,120
<i>Amen.
Everybody up on your feet. </i>

125
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,160
<i> Jesus is our light. </i>

126
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,720
<i>Hey, honey, I'm home. </i>

127
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,080
Jesus, you scared me.

128
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,360
How are you feeling?
I feel great.

129
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,960
Have you been
smoking again?

130
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,680
For fuck's sake, Paul.

131
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,920
You know if they find out you're smoking,
they'll take you off the transplant list.

132
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,280
<i>If I don't smoke,
I'll go fuckin'nuts. </i>

133
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,720
Better nuts than dead.

134
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,200
<i>Is that necessary?</i>

135
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,880
I don't know
how the hell you get them.

136
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,520
Call an ambulance!

137
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,760
<i>Baby!</i>

138
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Call a fucking ambulance!
Goddamn it!

139
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,760
Please, do something.

140
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,160
Come on, please.

141
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,880
<i>Al, you want a Coke?</i>

142
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,120
Jack, boss wants to talk to you.
He wants to see you now.

143
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,320
<i>Come on. We both know
I'm not a caddie yet,</i>

144
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,640
but I'm working at it.

145
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,320
And I'm learning, Brown.

146
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,880
Man, I swear to God,
I'm not going to let you down.

147
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,880
No, Jack, that's not the
problem. What's the problem?

148
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,000
The problem is some members have
started complaining about your tattoos.

149
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,320
I got a long-sleeved shirt. No, man...
No long-sleeved shirt...

150
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,520
You can't see it. Is gonna cover
that one on your neck right there.

151
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,960
You're gonna
start wearing a scarf.

152
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,080
Look, Jack. This club is for
people different from me and you.

153
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,640
No. You know, I don't drink.
I don't steal.

154
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm clean.
Tell me, why me?

155
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,800
Look, I know you're clean.
That's why I hired you.

156
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,880
But this decision
comes from the administration.

157
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,880
If I don't follow through,
they're gonna fuck me too.

158
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,440
Look, I cut you
a hefty severance check,

159
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,040
and you can pick it up
on the way to the cashier's.

160
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,840
Try to understand.

161
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,080
<i>Good. 
So, is there any pain?</i>

162
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,000
My head hurts a little bit.

163
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,200
That's normal. That's because
of the blood pressure medicine.

164
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,320
We'll get you something else
to make you feel better.

165
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,720
Thank you.
I brought...

166
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,160
...what you asked for.

167
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,640
Is that my heart?

168
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,240
The culprit.

169
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,560
Which one is he?

170
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,400
That's him
with the brown vest.

171
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,840
<i>He's putting the bag
up on top right now. </i>

172
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,600
You okay?

173
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,680
Come here.

174
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,000
I wanna kill him.

175
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,480
We have to kill him.

176
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,320
Thank you, Lord,
for keeping us together,

177
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,280
<i>for filling us with love
and for giving us this meal. </i>

178
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,920
Amen.

179
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,160
I got fired
from the club today.

180
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,520
'Cause of your
good pal Brown, right?

181
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,160
<i>He had nothing to do with it. 
It's mine!</i>

182
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,080
<i>- Believe that, Jack?
- Yes, I do.</i>

183
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,920
Freddy, stop it.

184
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,680
Mommy, Freddy hit me in
the arm. Which arm, baby?

185
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,680
This one.
Jack, don't start.

186
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,480
Hold out your other arm
and let your brother hit you.

187
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,120
- Give me it!
- Jack, no!

188
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,520
Hold it out.

189
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,280
Whoever slaps you on the right
cheek, turn the other to him also.

190
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,800
Hit her.
Don't be afraid.

191
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,200
<i>-  Jack, no! -
- Hit her!</i>

192
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,640
<i>Isn't that great. Wonderful. 
Great parenting, Jack. </i>

193
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,720
Good job.
It's okay.

194
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,440
He didn't hurt her.

195
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,960
There's no hitting
in this house.

196
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,200
Understand?

197
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,160
Get in the corner!

198
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,360
Do I put the chocolate chips
in now, Mommy?

199
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,480
That's right, honey,
and then stir.

200
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,000
Stir really quick.

201
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,040
Laura, put that back.
Come on.

202
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,840
When is Daddy coming? Soon. Now
let's get this finished, honey.

203
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,120
None for you.

204
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,280
No, Laura, stop it now.

205
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,560
Next Friday, ask Lupe
to stay the night.

206
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,360
I can't stay, 'cause I invited the
company managers over for dinner.

207
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,680
I fired her.

208
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,600
What, you fired her?
Why?

209
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,200
She made me feel
like a cripple.

210
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,800
Goddamn it, Paul.

211
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,920
So, now who's going
to cook for you?

212
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,840
Who's going to clean up after you?
Who's going to take care of you?

213
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,760
<i>Who?
I can do it for myself. </i>

214
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,680
<i>You can do it
by yourself. </i>

215
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,960
I can't do it anymore, Paul.

216
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,000
Really, I can't.

217
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,880
What are you doing?

218
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,360
I'm just... What?
What does it feel like I'm doing?

219
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,520
Don't. Don't.
You might hurt yourself.

220
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,160
I'm not gonna hurt myself.
Besides, I need you to...

221
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,600
I went to a fertility clinic.

222
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,920
Good, more doctors. Mary, I
can't have this discussion again.

223
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,360
No, this is a...
this is a specialist.

224
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,800
He said that with surgery,
I might get pregnant.

225
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,160
<i>You need to donate sperm and then...
Mary, no. </i>

226
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,240
<i>I could take care of him. </i>

227
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,640
But I can't.
So what's the point?

228
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,920
This is what I most want
in the world.

229
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,480
Do it for me, please.

230
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,720
<i>This'll be $58.95.</i>

231
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,080
<i>Thank you. </i>

232
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,480
<i>Find everything you need, sir?</i>

233
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,800
I'll have...

234
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,960
You know what?
I left my wallet.

235
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,120
Gonna be hot.

236
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,280
Great.

237
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,640
When does my brother
plan to show up?

238
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,240
He said he'll be back
by 6:00.

239
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,000
One hundred percent
pure golden lager.

240
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,560
You outta your mind?

241
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,920
Pretty much.
It's warm.

242
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,040
Well, if you wanna drink
lemonade all night...

243
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,960
Just give it here.
Give me...

244
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,280
Katie? Laura?

245
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,600
Where are you guys?

246
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,120
Hi, sweetheart, it's Dad. I was hoping
we could have lunch one day next week.

247
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,040
Give me a call.

248
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,960
Hi, honey.
I'm on my way home.

249
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,800
If you need me to pick up anything along the way...
Look, Daddy, a pigeon!

250
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,200
Girls, no, don't touch.
Laura, stop it.

251
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,600
Gimme a call on my cell.
I'll see you in a bit. Bye.

252
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,280
To send a message, press...

253
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,000
Hello.

254
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,240
Speaking.

255
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,520
What?

256
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,320
Where?

257
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,520
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

258
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,160
<i>Now, Mary, you understand that even if the operation
is successful,</i>

259
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,840
<i>artificial insemination
doesn't always work. </i>

260
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,000
It doesn't matter.
We want to try.

261
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,840
<i>Paul?</i>

262
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,960
Now, Paul

263
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,840
<i>this is about
having a child.</i>

264
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,040
<i>And with your condition,</i>

265
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,160
<i>you know you probably
won't ever meet him. </i>

266
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,360
Well, life goes on, right?

267
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,200
I'd like you to put on one of these
gloves to avoid contaminating the sample.

268
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:34,320
And try to make it
all land in the receptacle.

269
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,880
When you're done,
just leave it in here.

270
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,640
In case you need
a little inspiration.

271
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,040
<i>Big boy, what are you doing?</i>

272
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,920
<i>You ready to party?
I'm here now. </i>

273
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,800
<i>There you go!</i>

274
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,960
<i>Good, come on. Come on!</i>

275
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,960
<i>Dr. Swann, call the operator. </i>

276
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,800
Excuse me. My husband and
daughters were in an accident,

277
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,720
and I was told to come
here. What were their names?

278
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,920
Michael, Catherine
and Laura Peck.

279
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,240
Excuse me for a minute.

280
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,200
Cris.
What happened, sweetheart?

281
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,000
I don't know. They haven't
told me anything yet.

282
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,600
It's gonna be all right.
Everything will be okay. Don't worry.

283
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,720
<i>Okay, what is the most important question
for safe sex?</i>

284
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,960
What time does
your husband get home?

285
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,080
<i>That's good? </i>

286
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,720
His Highness has arrived.

287
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,120
Let's see
what he comes up with.

288
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,040
Serve up that chili.

289
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,520
It's 7:00. What are you gonna
make up this time... traffic?

290
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,640
You preaching the word? The entire
congregation has been waiting for you.

291
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,720
It's your party, remember?
What's wrong?

292
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,520
Have you been drinking?

293
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,280
No. You didn't drink again, did you?

294
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,720
I just ran over
a man and two girls.

295
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,440
You're lying, right?

296
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,760
I was driving home.

297
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,000
Took a turn...

298
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,800
a little too quickly.

299
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,720
I didn't see them crossing.

300
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,000
Can't you go any faster?

301
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,160
Baby, hold on.

302
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,680
I love you.

303
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,400
Deep breath.

304
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Good.

305
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,480
<i>- Your lungs are clear. 
- I got a question for you.</i>

306
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,400
Whose heart do I have?

307
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,800
<i>I can't tell you. 
It's hospital regulations. </i>

308
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,640
Just like the donor's family
doesn't know your name either.

309
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,680
- But you know.
Yes.

310
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,360
This is your heart now. That's
all that should matter to you.

311
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,320
<i>- I wanna know who saved my life.
- If you want, you can write... </i>

312
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,920
an anonymous letter to the family
through the donor's association.

313
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,280
Personally, I think it's better
that you don't know.

314
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,840
Mrs. Peck?
I'm Dr. Jones.

315
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,680
What happened to my
family? Please, sit down.

316
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,400
No, I'm okay.
What happened?

317
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,880
Well, your husband and your
daughters were hit by a car,

318
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,040
and we had to perform
emergency surgery on your husband.

319
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,840
<i>Your husband suffered
multiple skull fractures,</i>

320
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,280
<i>and we had to remove blood clots
from around the brain. </i>

321
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,280
He's in critical condition, and we're
concerned that he's showing low brain activity.

322
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,600
What?
Is he gonna be all right?

323
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,640
We're doing the best we can.

324
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,440
<i>And what about
my daughters?</i>

325
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,080
Your youngest daughter
was brought in with severe bleeding.

326
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,520
She just wasn't able
to get here in time.

327
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,840
I'm very sorry.
They both died in the accident.

328
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,600
<i>Where are they?</i>

329
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,280
<i>Mrs. Peck, your girls are here, and
you can see them if you like, but... </i>

330
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,680
<i>I wanna see them.
Mrs. Peck, I wouldn't recommend it. </i>

331
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,280
<i>I'm very sorry. 
If you'll excuse us,</i>

332
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,800
<i>we have to get back
to Mr. Peck. </i>

333
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,720
<i>I'm very sorry. </i>

334
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,840
We want dinner!

335
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,560
Marianne, we'd like
some dinner in here!

336
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,120
<i>Tell Reverend John to stay. 
Make sure no one notices and get everyone to leave. </i>

337
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,960
<i>What happened?
Trish, just do what I tell ya!</i>

338
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,960
It's gonna be okay.

339
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It's gonna be okay.

340
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,600
Come on.
Start the truck up.

341
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,920
Start the truck up. Pull
it in. Come on, baby.

342
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
<i>Hey, Jack. </i>

343
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,600
What are you
doing here, man?

344
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,120
Just came to pick up
my things, Brown.

345
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,120
Why don't you let me
buy you a couple of beers?

346
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,800
I don't drink, Brown.

347
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,960
How about a Diet Coke?

348
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,560
You know, I've been talking to a buddy
of mine about hooking you up with a job.

349
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,000
Been telling him
all about you.

350
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,400
So, what do you say? I've been
feeling shitty about what went down.

351
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,240
Come on.
I understand.

352
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,160
So, what do you say?

353
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,520
As you know, the doctors did everything
they could to save your husband's life,

354
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,480
but he has shown
no brain activity.

355
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,840
We're here to help you with some of the
final decisions that need to be made.

356
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,080
We have a patient...

357
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,080
who is gravely ill.

358
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,600
I'm here to give you some
information on organ donation.

359
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,640
Are you willing for your
husband to donate his heart?

360
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,000
- Can we discuss this another time?
- I'm afraid not.

361
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,000
I can give you time to discuss it, but this
is a decision that needs to be made soon.

362
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,920
<i>Paul?</i>

363
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,080
<i>Paul, the beeper. </i>

364
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,760
It's the hospital.

365
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,800
I think they've
got a heart.

366
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,520
Hello? Yes, I'm calling on
behalf of Mr. Paul Rivers.

367
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,640
Yes.

368
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,200
Yes, I understand.

369
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,200
Where do I
have to take him?

370
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,360
Good luck, my love.

371
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,600
Hello.

372
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,560
Hello.

373
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,120
Does your shoulder
bother you?

374
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,240
Why? Because I was
watching you swim before,

375
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,640
and you have a wide stroke.

376
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,560
If you bring it in tighter,
you get a better glide.

377
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,880
Thanks for the advice.

378
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,480
Do you mind
if I join you?

379
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,640
- Actually, I was just leaving.
- Here you go.

380
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,600
Maybe just until you finish?

381
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,320
No. Maybe next time.

382
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,000
Did you know that eating alone can
cause kidney damage? And that's bad.

383
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,160
Well...
Okay, sorry.

384
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,520
Hello?

385
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,520
Hello, is Ana there?

386
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,440
What?

387
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,680
Is Ana there?
Hang on a sec.

388
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,280
Telephone.

389
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,720
Who was that?

390
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,760
Hi, honey, I'm on my way home. If you need me
to pick up anything along the way, let me know.

391
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,440
<i>Look, Daddy, a pigeon!
Girls, no, don't touch!</i>

392
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,640
Laura, stop it.
Gimme a call on my cell.

393
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,880
I'll see you in a bit.
Bye.

394
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,000
Did you go?

395
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,880
Are they dead?

396
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,360
I'm gonna turn myself in.

397
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,320
<i> John says nobody saw you. 
Nobody. </i>

398
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,680
They don't know the license plate or what kind
of car. Some asshole even swears it was a cab.

399
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,240
Marianne, what would you do if
these were our children? Tell me.

400
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,040
But they're not.
It didn't happen to us.

401
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,720
No, it didn't happen to us.

402
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,120
It happened to me.

403
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,720
What the fuck do you gain
by turning yourself in?

404
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,640
It's my duty, Marianne.

405
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,960
No, Jack, your duty
is here with us.

406
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,880
With your family.

407
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,840
My duty's to God.

408
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,600
Please.
Marianne,

409
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,840
get outta my way.

410
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,000
<i> Jack. </i>

411
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,040
Buddy, right there! Yes!

412
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,920
My turn.

413
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,240
I think I better
go back to the hospital.

414
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,520
<i>Hey, he deserves it. 
I thought your doctor you're not supposed to eat that. </i>

415
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,680
I'm making up
for lost time.

416
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,840
<i>Lost time, not lost pounds. </i>

417
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,960
<i>We're gonna have to
send you back for liposuction. </i>

418
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,320
<i>Well, here's to all those
who didn't think I was going to die.</i>

419
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,520
<i>Hear!</i>

420
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,960
<i>To the first day of my new life.
Congratulations. </i>

421
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,560
Cheers. It's good to have you home, man.

422
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,120
<i>I knew you'd make it. 
I told you. </i>

423
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,440
I also have
an announcement to make.

424
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,920
I wanted to tell you that Paul
and I are going to be parents.

425
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,280
<i>That's great. 
There's a scary thought... Paul being a parent. </i>

426
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,520
- You kept this real quiet.
- Have you told your parents yet?

427
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,240
We're going to be parents.
We just don't know when yet.

428
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,160
I'm going to have an operation, and then
we're going to try artificial insemination.

429
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,640
<i>Terrific. Terrific.
Artificial insemination?</i>

430
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,160
<i>Professor, do your female students know
you no longer have lead in your pencil?</i>

431
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,280
<i>Come on!</i>

432
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,800
<i>Play nice!</i>

433
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,360
<i>Let's have more cake. 
Let's pass the cake around. </i>

434
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,960
Mr. Donneaud?
Mr. Rivers?

435
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,880
Thanks for coming.

436
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,680
Sorry I couldn't cancel this appointment, but
the way I'm bowling today, probably should have.

437
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,600
Have a seat here.
Park it right there.

438
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,120
Can I bring you
something to eat?

439
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,680
I'm not hungry. Honey,
you need to eat something.

440
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,560
I'm fine, Dad.

441
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,480
When your mother died,
I thought I wasn't going to make it.

442
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:05,280
I felt the world was falling on me
and that I was never going to get up.

443
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:09,920
But, sweetie,
life goes on.

444
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,040
You know what I thought
when Mom died?

445
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,640
I couldn't understand
how you could talk to people again.

446
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,840
How you could laugh... again.

447
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,480
I couldn't understand
how you could play with us.

448
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,800
And no...
no, that's a lie.

449
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,320
Life does not just go on.

450
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,680
Louise is getting fat,
don't you think?

451
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,520
She's done nothing but eat
since Robert left her.

452
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,000
What?
She looks okay to you?

453
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,080
Why did you tell everybody
we're having a baby?

454
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,960
I wanted to share
our plans with them.

455
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,920
That's what I mean,
they're our plans.

456
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,920
Why does everyone have to
know our private life?

457
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,160
Why the fuss?
They're our best friends.

458
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,600
But we haven't
even talked about it.

459
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,600
We haven't? I thought
this was more than settled.

460
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,960
Things change, Mary.

461
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,360
Something we have to
think about.

462
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,280
I don't have anything
to think about.

463
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,640
I've already
made my decision.

464
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,600
Would you help me
with the glasses?

465
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,520
<i>So young. </i>

466
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,760
<i>You want me to stay
with you tonight?</i>

467
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,280
I'm okay. Thanks.

468
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,360
I just wanna be alone.

469
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,840
Cris,

470
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,600
the police called.

471
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,800
They said you need to
go and press charges.

472
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,160
I'll go with you
if you want.

473
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,760
I'm not going to do anything.

474
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,960
This guy was...
was some ex-con.

475
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,920
Are you really gonna let him
just walk the streets?

476
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,840
What do you want me to do?

477
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,480
Well, he ran over
Michael and your daughters.

478
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,960
Nothing I can do
is going to bring them back.

479
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,200
<i>Do you get that?</i>

480
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,600
How you doin'?

481
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,000
You found it okay?
I did.

482
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,520
The donor's name was Michael
Peck. He was 37 years old.

483
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,880
An architect
and married.

484
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,200
This is the authorization for transplant
signed by his wife, Cristina Williams Peck.

485
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,320
I have a copy of the medical
report if you care to see it.

486
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,240
And I also have the widow's phone number
and address just in case you're interested.

487
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:24,360
How did Michael Peck die?

488
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,520
You might have seen it
in the newspaper.

489
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,400
This guy named Jack Jordan ran over
Mr. Peck and his two little girls...

490
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,200
<i>October 10
at 6:50 p. m. </i>

491
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,840
This Jack Jordan's a piece of work. He's
been in and out of jail since he was 16.

492
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,880
Car thief,
small-time crook, drugs,

493
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,680
bad checks, alcoholism.

494
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,280
Last time he was in jail
has only been a few years ago.

495
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,360
You feeling okay, Mr. Rivers?

496
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,240
This is what you wanted,
isn't it?

497
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,320
I just...
You want some water?

498
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,640
He was an architect.

499
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,360
What's the point
in getting involved?

500
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,840
Mary, I wanna know
who I am now.

501
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,720
I don't think
that's the way to do it.

502
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,680
What is then?

503
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,800
<i>Look for it with me. </i>

504
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,000
Let's look ahead together,
not behind.

505
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,480
Damn it, Jack, it's your birthday and
you didn't even have one drink with me.

506
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,400
Why don't you come over to my place?
I'm having a party.

507
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,320
I bet they're all
as boring as you are.

508
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,080
You'd be surprised.
No, man, I'll pass.

509
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,080
Listen, I'll call you later
about that job, okay?

510
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,000
All right, man.
All right.

511
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,040
Thank you.

512
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,120
Brown, you should.

513
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,040
I will.

514
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,520
<i>Okay, now, we can schedule
the surgery</i>

515
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,320
I could get you in
as early as Monday.

516
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,880
<i>9:00 a. m?</i>

517
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,600
What's the percentage chance
that Mary will get pregnant?

518
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,760
<i>Well, I can't offer you
a real number on that. </i>

519
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,560
You know, there's the
damage from the abortion...

520
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,480
<i>that wasn't handled properly... 
the blockage... </i>

521
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,800
<i>What abortion?</i>

522
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,680
<i>What abortion, Mary?</i>

523
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,640
I can explain.
Explain what?

524
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,920
There is an explanation.

525
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,560
All that drama
about artificial insemination.

526
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,680
Kids' names.

527
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,760
You got pictures of our friends'
babies all over the place.

528
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,680
Why?

529
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,080
So you can flush it
down the fuckin' toilet?

530
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,480
We've been a fraud
for a long time, Mary.

531
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,680
Why didn't you tell
me that when you were sick?

532
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,520
Or did you expect one of your
girlfriends to come and take care of you?

533
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,560
You came back because you wanted
to. Don't blame me for that.

534
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,040
I came back to take care of you
because I love you.

535
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,760
Or because
you were feeling lonely.

536
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,520
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

537
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,640
I can't keep going like this.

538
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,920
The insemination,
the child.

539
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,120
It's like we're trying to put a Band-Aid
on something that's just been bled dry.

540
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,800
It's finished.

541
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:20,600
But it isn't finished if we
give it a chance and have this baby.

542
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,520
When we could have,
you didn't want to.

543
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,800
We were separated, goddamn it!
It's different now!

544
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,240
Yes, it's different.

545
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:33,280
We gonna go? You only know
how to think about yourself.

546
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,640
<i>Close six!</i>

547
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,120
Well, thanks
for finally seeing me.

548
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,360
They tell me
you don't want to eat.

549
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,640
I'm not hungry.

550
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,520
Jack, Jesus didn't come
to free us from pain.

551
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,120
He came to give us
the strength to bear it.

552
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,560
Maybe He wanted
this pain for me.

553
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,960
<i>No, He had nothing to do with this. 
It was an accident. </i>

554
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,960
No, it wasn't an accident.

555
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,720
Jesus chose me for this.

556
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,000
Jack,

557
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,440
ask for the mercy
of Jesus Christ.

558
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,960
If it was an accident,

559
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,760
why do I have to ask
for His mercy?

560
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,200
"I will have mercy
on whom I will have mercy.

561

"As many as I love, I rebuke

Forgive me?</i>

575
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:11,040

asked me to do! I changed!

<i>I gave Him my life,
and He betrayed me. </i>

577
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,840
He put that fucking truck in my hand
so I could carry out His will.

578
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,760
Made me kill that man
and those girls.

579
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,400
He didn't give me the
strength to stay and save them.

580
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,960
Don't blaspheme, you bastard!
Christ had nothing to do with this!

God even knows when a single
hair moves on your head.

615
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,520
<i> You okay?</i>

616
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:48,520
<i>Stupid fucking asshole, move your car!
I'm fine. Get away from my car!</i>

617
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,960
There's no damage. I'm
fine. Get away from my car.

618
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,920
There's no damage.
Excuse me, I know her. I can drive her home.

619
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Is this any of your business? I'm
your friend Paul from the sports club.

620
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,320
Remember?

621
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,760
Well, can you tell these
assholes to get away from me?

622
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:08,040
I'll drive her home.
It's not a big deal, okay?

623
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:11,920
Okay. All right?
You can't drive like this.

624
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,240
What do you care?

625
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,960
You're gonna get arrested.
Let me drive you.

626
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,880
Please?

627
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,080
Damn it.

628
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,160
I sold the truck
to pay for the lawyer.

629
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I didn't ask for a lawyer.

630
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:04,880
You want your children to spend
another two years without you?

631
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,800
Is that what you want?

632
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,240
<i>This is God's will. 
So be it. </i>

633
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,760
Two years ago,
you didn't believe in anything.

634
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,800
Now everything
has to do with God.

635
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,640
I think I preferred you
the way you were before.

636
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,800
I was a fucking pig before.
Is that what you prefer?

637
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,960
<i>At least it was you. </i>

638
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,360
Now I don't have the slightest
fucking idea who you are.

639
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,960
Life has to go on, Jack,
with or without God.

640
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,360
How you doin'?
How are you?

641
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,840
Fine. Were you able
to find anything out?

642
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,520
Jack Jordan's living in a cheap motel
lost out in the middle of nowhere.

643
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,520
Phone records.

644
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,920
One of his prison fishy pals
is from there.

645
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,400
- That was quick.
- Just a matter of checking the calls.

646
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,880
Phone number and address
for the motel he's living in.

647
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,480
Here's a pretty recent photo
of Jordan.

648
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,760
It was taken the last time
he was in jail.

649
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:53,280
Were you able to get that other
thing that I asked about?

650
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:01,920
This is a clean gun, no record.
They call this an "orphan. "

651
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,360
It is loaded.

652
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,080
Careful there, Hoss.

653
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:12,200
You don't have to cock it. Just pull the
trigger to shoot it. This releases the cylinder.

654
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,760
I think we're set to go.
That's all I want to know.

655
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,160
Thank you.
Good luck to you.

656
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,760
Ma'am, it's been an hour
since I called.

657
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,240
Forty-six St. Vincent Street.

658
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,320
Thank you.

659
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:57,320
Some rain.

660
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:04,480
Do you not have your car? No, but
my taxi will be here in a minute.

661
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,400
I'm right over here.
I'll give you a lift if you like.

662
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,520
No. Thanks.

663
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,960
I'm the guy who drove
your car home last week.

664
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,800
I'm sorry.
I don't remember.

665
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,000
I left my jacket with you.

666
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:35,400
I'm sorry.
I'll bring it by tomorrow.

667
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,800
Sure I can't give you a ride?
I'm right here.

668
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,760
Or do you want to swim?

669
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:13,040
Hello.

670
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:40,000
Thanks.
You're very welcome.

671
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:45,000
Let me just give you my cell
phone number so you can have it.

672
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,760
Would you have
lunch with me tomorrow?

673
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,920
What for?

674
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,360
You're gonna have to eat at some point,
and I'm very worried about those kidneys.

675
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:09,160
Come on. Lawrence's, 2:00.
It's very nearby.

676
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,120
Please. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

677
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,960
Great.

678
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:26,280
<i>... report we have construction on the ramp
coming from southbound 240 at Summer. </i>

679
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:30,120
<i>That ramp is closed until 6:00 p. m. 
Use Arlington Pike as an alternate. </i>

680
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,760
<i>Forty at the new bridge,
they have the center lane closed. </i>

681
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,920
<i>Use southbound I-20 as an alternate. 
Safe Driving believes so strongly in minimum coverage. </i>

682
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,760
<i>They're easy, fast, affordable and reliable. 
They're serious about minimum coverage. </i>

683
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:46,240
<i>1- 800-SAFE-DRIVING.
Minimum coverage is the best option... </i>

684
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:49,960
Look, Daddy, a pigeon!
Daddy, look!

685
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,840
Girls, no, don't. Don't touch it.
Laura, stop it.

686
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,320
Gimme a call on my cell.
I'll see you in a bit. Bye.

687
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,520
Good night, Mr. Peck.

688
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:02,800
Lucio, don't forget to do my garden
on Saturday. No, sir, I won't forget.

689
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,280
Son of a bitch.

690
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,280
Leave it to me, Marianne.

691
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,480
Sometimes it happens, sometimes it
doesn't. Everybody reacts differently.

692
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,320
That's why you've been
vomiting so much.

693
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,880
So, what are you saying,
I've got to change medication?

694
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,040
I'm gonna be
frank with you, Paul.

695
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:59,080
The heart that you're carrying
is gonna give out soon.

696
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,920
<i>I need you to stay in the hospital
until I can find you another heart. </i>

697
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,360
<i>You want me to wait for a new heart.
We don't have another choice. </i>

698
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:15,880
I can't do that. I can't wait for someone
else to die, locked up in a fucking room.

699
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:21,160
I can't do it.
- You're dangerously close to heart failure, Paul.

700
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:25,720
<i>You might die a lot sooner
than you think. </i>

701
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,840
Let me ask you something, and I want
you to be really honest with me, okay?

702
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:40,280
If I stay...

703
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,400
will I be saved?

704
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,880
<i>I can't guarantee it. </i>

705
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:49,000
But if you don't
come back to the hospital,

706
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,680
you're condemning yourself
to a terrible death.

707
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:55,640
<i>Your heart won't work anymore. 
You'll die, asphyxiated. </i>

708
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:59,360
<i>It's an awful death, Paul. 
You can't imagine it. </i>

709
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:03,920
<i>At least here we could help you to... 
You can help me die better.</i>

710
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,760
That's what you're saying.
You can help me die better.

711
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:12,240
Well, I'm not gonna do that, okay?
I'd rather die outside.

712
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,840
I'm not gonna do it again.

713
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,600
How much did the lawyer charge?

714
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:32,320
<i>Marianne, how much did the fucking
lawyer charge?  Enough. </i>

715
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:33,960
How much is enough,
Marianne?

716
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,880
Enough so your children can
remember your fucking face.

717
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:41,360
You keep asking stupid questions,
I'm getting out at the next corner.

718
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,600
<i>Hi, guys. We're home. </i>

719
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,840
<i>Daddy! Daddy!
What'd you bring us?</i>

720
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,640
I brought you a kiss.

721
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:08,800
You didn't bring me a
present? No, just a kiss.

722
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,560
We made you a cake.
Thank you, sweetheart.

723
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,080
Freddy put the icing on it.

724
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,520
Freddy, are you gonna
say hello to your father?

725
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:24,360
<i>Freddy drew those for you. </i>

726
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,880
I drew those ones.

727
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:31,240
Mommy made the cake.
Come here.

728
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:36,720
<i>Come look at the cake, Daddy. 
 She did?</i>

729
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,640
<i>Come on, Daddy. </i>

730
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:54,720
There is a number hidden in every act
of life, in every aspect of the universe.

731
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:59,080
Fractals, matter... that there's a
number screaming to tell us something.

732
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:04,560
Am I boring you?

733
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,600
I'm sorry.

734
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,560
I guess I try to tell them
that numbers are a door...

735
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:14,400
to understanding a mystery
that's bigger than us.

736
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:19,040
How two people, strangers,
come to meet.

737
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:22,880
There's a poem by
a Venezuelan writer that begins...

738
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:29,000
"The earth turned
to bring us closer.

739
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:32,080
"It turned on itself and in us...

740
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:35,200
until it finally brought us
together in this dream. "

741
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,760
That's beautiful.

742
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:47,720
There's so many things that have to
happen for two people to meet and...

743
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:51,320
Anyway, that's...
that's what mathematics are.

744
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,800
<i>How long have you been swimming?</i>

745
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,920
<i>For years. </i>

746
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,560
It doesn't bore you? No. It's
what makes me feel normal.

747
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:08,680
If I didn't swim or walk or do
something, I think I'd go crazy.

748
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,320
Thanks for lunch.

749
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,720
Do you want to come in?
No.

750
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,640
Thanks...
Yes, I do want to come in.

751
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:34,080
Can I ask you...

752
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,720
I have a gun.

753
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,800
<i>Don't look at me. Don't look at me. 
Don't look at me. I'll shoot... </i>

754
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,840
- I don't have any money.
- Turn around. I'll shoot you. Just turn around. Go.

755
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,880
<i>- I don't have any... 
- Walk!</i>

756
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,280
<i>Put 'em up! Put your hands up!
Why?</i>

757
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:53,280
<i>- Wait. 
-  Just walk. Go!</i>

758
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,840
We're gonna go down that path right there.
Do what I say and then you won't get hurt.

759
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:58,320
- I don't have any...
- Go!

760
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,480
I'm not looking. Come on. Keep
walking. Go right down here.

761
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,320
Just keep walking. Keep walk... I said
don't look at me. I'll shoot you in the head.

762
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:09,120
Keep your hands up!
Walk! Over here.

763
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,680
Over here.
Come on, don't look at me.

764
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,120
<i>Keep going!</i>

765
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,320
<i>Right</i>

766
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:21,360
Turn around. But keep your hands on your head.

767
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:26,000
Get... Take your shoes
off and get down on your knees.

768
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,880
Take off your shoes.

769
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:32,360
No, not that... not that one.
- Just get down on your knees! Get down on your knees!

770
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,600
Sir, please.

771
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,760
You shouldn't have done it.

772
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:44,520
Done what?

773
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,520
You shouldn't have done it!

774
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,440
Close your goddamn eyes!

775
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:36,640
She looked me in the eyes.
What are you talking about?

776
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,400
One of the girls that I killed,

777
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,560
she looked me in the eye.

778
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:53,640
She wanted to tell me something.

779
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:00,040
I just... I left her there.

780
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,960
I ran away.

781
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,680
You sticking with red?
Sure.

782
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,200
Are you okay?

783
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,280
Sorry. Dizzy.

784
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:29,320
Can I get you a glass of water
or something?

785
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,440
I think I should go home.

786
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,520
I'm sorry. I just...

787
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,320
I like you a lot, Cristina.

788
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:49,840
It's been a long time since
I liked someone so much.

789
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,280
Can I see you again?

790
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,200
I'm a married woman.

791
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:04,080
I figured.

792
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:14,040
Thanks.
Good-bye.

793
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,440
<i>  I've got peace like a river </i>

794
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:42,320
<i>-   I've got peace like a river in my soul 
- Everybody!</i>

795
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:48,320
<i>  I've got love like an ocean </i>

796
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:54,640
<i>  I've got love like an ocean
in my soul </i>

797
01:19:54,720 --> 01:20:01,040
<i>  I've got joy like a fountain...
I've got joy like a fountain </i>

798
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:06,720
<i>  I've got joy like a fountain
in my soul </i>

799
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:10,800
<i>- Look, Daddy. These are the zebras, these are the lions. 
- Very pretty, Gina. </i>

800
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,760
How could you draw a zoo if you've
never been to one? I've seen them in...

801
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,760
Stop fighting.

802
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:21,800
The lawyer called to remind you
you have to go sign on Monday.

803
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:27,080
<i>If you want, I'll go with you to the church again.
Daddy, in school they said... </i>

804
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,480
you killed two girls
and their daddy.

805
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,040
<i>Is that true?
Yes.</i>

806
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:36,400
- No.
- Yes.

807
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:42,760
<i>- He killed them.
- It was an accident, sweetie. </i>

808
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,120
<i>You understand?</i>

809
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:53,240
Jesus, every time
I look at my children...

810
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,440
Who is this?

811
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:29,000
Did I wake you?

812
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,000
Hang on a second.

813
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:41,280
Did I wake you?
No, that's okay.

814
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:46,280
Could you come
to my house?

815
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:51,640
Is something wrong?
No, I just...

816
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:56,560
I just want you to come
if you can.

817
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:59,160
Or if you want to.

818
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:03,240
I'll be right there.

819
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,920
Thanks.

820
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,440
It's 2:00 in the morning.
Who are you talking to?

821
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:16,360
I won't be long.

822
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,520
Where are you going?

823
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:22,160
I said I won't be long. Exactly
where and with who are you going?

824
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,920
I thought you'd change
after the transplants.

825
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,560
And I thought you'd change
if I did. Neither of us changed.

826
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:23,080
What's wrong?
He's been shot in the chest.

827
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,800
<i>-  Come on. 
- Shot in the chest.</i>

828
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:28,040
He's been shot in the chest.
Come on.

829
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:30,760
<i>- How long's he been like that?
- He's dying, okay? We need a...</i>

830
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,400
I'll go get a stretcher.

831
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:36,400
- Ma'am, he'll be right back.
- It's okay.

832
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:39,600
Hang in there, baby.
I shot him.

833
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:44,320
<i>-  You did what?
- I shot him.</i>

834
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,040
Patrol, I need you
to call the police.

835
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:49,840
<i>It's an emergency, yes. 
I'm right out front. </i>

836
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,680
Are you okay?

837
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,400
Cristina?

838
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:19,080
You kept me thinking all day.

839
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:25,160
You see, I haven't spoken
to anyone in months,

840
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:27,600
and I barely know you...

841
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:30,840
and I already
need to talk to you.

842
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,280
And...

843
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:41,120
there's something the more I
think about, the less I understand.

844
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:47,080
Why the hell did you tell me
that you liked me?

845
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:52,520
Answer me, because I didn't
like you saying that at all.

846
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:59,360
You can't just walk up to a woman you
barely know and tell her you like her.

847
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,640
You-You can't.
You can't do that.

848
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:04,120
You don't know
what she's going through.

849
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,120
Or what she's feeling.

850
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:12,000
I'm not married.

851
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,360
Come here.

852
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,680
It's okay.

853
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,520
I'm sorry.
No.

854
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,280
Cristina, wait.

855
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,480
I have to tell you something.

856
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:02,080
I have to tell you something.
Please, kiss me.

857
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,320
Wait. Cristina.

858
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,160
I have Michael's heart.

859
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:14,680
What...
I have Michael's heart.

860
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:19,160
You understand what I'm saying?

861
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:23,880
It was transplanted into me at
St. Francis Hospital on October 11.

862
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,800
No. No.

863
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:29,280
I tried to tell you. I just
didn't know how to tell you.

864
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:33,000
How dare you! Cristina...

865
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:35,560
How fucking dare you!
I'm here for a reason.

866
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:37,800
Get out of my house!

867
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:40,280
Don't touch me!

868
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,800
Get out of my house now!
You make me sick!

869
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,880
I had a reason.
Can't you see that?

870
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:48,200
You get out of my fucking...
Get the fuck out of my house!

871
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,120
You make me sick!

872
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,320
Get out!

873
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:58,360
Good morning.

874
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,360
Why did you look for me?

875
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,520
Because I needed to.

876
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:19,360
I don't want your fucking pity.

877
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,120
That wasn't it.

878
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:33,000
I was sick, Cristina.
I was very sick.

879
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:39,960
I was dying when Michael
gave me his heart.

880
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:45,640
He saved my life.

881
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:55,280
I tried in every way that
I knew how to find out...

882
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:58,000
who had given me this heart.

883
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:01,920
And that's how I found out how
he and your daughters had died.

884
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:10,600
And it's very painful for me
to know how I got this heart.

885
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,960
And I couldn't sleep.

886
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:18,720
I just... I wanted to thank you.
I wanted to help in some way.

887
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,600
I just want to
thank you for...

888
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:28,320
But I couldn't find you.

889
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:35,280
And then I saw you...

890
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,440
that day.

891
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,080
And now I can't
be away from you.

892
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,960
I can't.

893
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:58,440
<i>You don't have to be afraid. </i>

894
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:03,240
I've got a good heart.

895
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,320
I'm scared too.

896
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:09,560
Why did you leave us, Jack? Why?
I am where I have to be.

897
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:13,200
Gina got really sick because of the hamster.
Jack, we need you... The past is like the Atlantic Ocean.

898
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:19,480
Back when I was mean,
about the decisions I make,

899
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:21,760
that's my mirror.
Just come back, please.

900
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:24,520
That's my mirror.
Jack, it doesn't matter.

901
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:28,640
And I have to live with them alone.
Alone. Just come back to us, Jack.

902
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:32,880
And I can't erase it. No one can
erase it. Your family needs you.

903
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:45,320
<i>We need to stabilize him before
we can get him to the hospital. </i>

904
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:49,520
But right now what we really need
are units of B-positive blood.

905
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,720
I'm O-positive.
Will that work?

906
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:54,640
Open and close your fist
several times.

907
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:38,880
<i>Unit 35, go ahead. </i>

908
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:46,280
<i>Pal, you're free to go
for lack of evidence. </i>

909
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:52,520
Your story doesn't check out
and contradicts our investigation...

910
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:56,760
and the statements made by
Mrs. Peck and Mr. Rivers.

911
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:59,360
I just need you to sign here.

912
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:02,120
<i>What if I really am guilty?</i>

913
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:04,560
Well, it happens.

914
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:07,560
Won't be the first time,
won't be the last.

915
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,320
What are you doing?

916
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:14,680
You've been lost for too many days,
don't you think, you prick?

917
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:18,400
Mary, I don't want to fight.
I want this to end well.

918
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:22,240
You think ending well means
disappearing for a few days?

919
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:25,680
You just waited till you got better
to tell me to fuck off.

920
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:28,640
I'm going back to London.
We can't keep doing this.

921
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:30,680
Really?

922
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:34,440
I'll have surgery and I'll be inseminated
with your child, with or without you.

923
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:37,800
Mary, what for? Why?
Because I want to.

924
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:41,680
Well, I won't authorize
that. No.

925
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:43,600
Well, you already have.

926
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:46,320
<i>I have a signed copy of your authorization
to use your semen. </i>

927
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:49,800
Would you excuse me? I get what I want.
What do you gain? What do you gain?

928
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:52,360
You decide if you come
looking for me or not.

929
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,840
<i>Hi, honey. 
I'm on my way home. </i>

930
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:45,480
<i>If you need me to pick up anything along the way, let me... 
Girls, no! Don't touch!</i>

931
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:49,240
Laura, stop, it.
Gimme a call on my cell.

932
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:51,200
I'll see you in a bit.
Bye.

933
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:54,800
To repeat the message, press one.
To delete, press two.

934
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:58,720
Hi, honey.
I'm on my way home.

935
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:02,560
If you need me to pick up anything along the way, let me...
Girls, no! Don't touch!

936
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:04,640
Laura, stop, it.

937
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:08,840
Gimme a call on my cell.
I'll see you in a bit. Bye.

938
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:34,480
<i>I'm grilling some chicken. 
You want anything to eat?</i>

939
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,040
No. Thanks.

940
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:40,680
<i>I can make you a sandwich if you... </i>

941
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:45,120
Listen to me.

942
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:48,880
You don't need that shit.
You don't need it.

943
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,360
Don't tell me what I need.

944
01:41:33,080 --> 01:41:35,040
Katie could have lived.

945
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,800
What?

946
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:43,080
She'd be alive right now,
but that bastard left her there...

947
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:48,240
lying in the street.

948
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:52,480
He left the three of them
like animals. He didn't care.

949
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,440
At least she could
be here with me.

950
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:04,400
That son of a bitch is walking the streets,
and I can't even go into their room.

951
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:06,320
What do you mean
he's walking the street?

952
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:11,680
I want to kill him.

953
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:13,960
You want to kill him?

954
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,600
I'm gonna kill Jack Jordan.
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.

955
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:19,920
Slow down. Wait.
Just slow down.

956
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,520
Slow down? Slow down while
I what? While I what?

957
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,440
Take it easy.

958
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:31,080
My husband and my little girls are dead
and I'm supposed to take it fucking easy?

959
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:34,560
I can't just go on
with my life!

960
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:40,040
I am paralyzed here! I am a
fucking amputee, do you see that?

961
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:42,560
Who are you?

962
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:46,360
<i>You owe it to Michael... 
No, you've got his heart. </i>

963
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:50,240
<i>You're in his house fucking his wife
and sitting in his chair!</i>

964
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:52,880
We have to kill him! No, we...
Not like this. Not like this.

965
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:55,240
Then how?
Tell me how!

966
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:18,960
Katie died
with red shoelaces on.

967
01:43:20,040 --> 01:43:22,880
She hated red shoelaces.

968
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:28,200
And she kept asking me
to get her some blue ones,

969
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:30,520
and I never got her
the blue ones.

970
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:36,520
She was wearing those fucking
red shoelaces when she was killed.

971
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:58,960
You shouldn't have done it!
Close your goddamn eyes!

972
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:10,800
You... murderer.

973
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:13,440
You just let them
lie there on the street.

974
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:16,560
Those two little girls,
you just let them die like dogs.

975
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,560
I should have killed you.

976
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:24,960
Now you disappear. Don't even go
back to the motel and get your things.

977
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,600
Just disappear.

978
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:08,880
Mrs. Peck.
How is he?

979
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:12,320
We weren't able to use
your blood for his transfusion.

980
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:17,760
We found very high levels of illegal substances
in your blood. You're taking very high risks here.

981
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:22,960
Well, that's my problem. In your state,
I suggest you stop using these substances.

982
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:26,680
What are you talking about?
You're pregnant, Mrs. Peck.

983
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:36,200
You sure? You really need to start
taking care of yourself, Mrs. Peck.

984
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:39,720
We'll let you know when
Mr. Rivers is out of the O.R.

985
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:32,160
Where were you?

986
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:39,000
Did you kill him?
Did you?

987
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:50,600
Why didn't you wake me up?

988
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:55,080
Where's the body?

989
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:59,320
Nobody will ever
find the body.

990
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:29,120
I'm sorry.

991
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:32,800
We're gonna go home now.

992
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:36,200
Let's just get
out of here, okay?

993
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:39,200
You okay?

994
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:41,960
It's okay, baby.
Just lie down.

995
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:48,840
Need rest. I need rest. I know.

996
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:53,960
I'm sorry.

997
01:47:57,160 --> 01:47:59,880
I love you.

998
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:34,520
Wake up.

999
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:39,320
There's somebody outside.

1000
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:16,440
You want to kill me?

1001
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:19,560
<i>What's he doing here?
Here I am.</i>

1002
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:22,240
<i>Shoot me. </i>

1003
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:26,040
<i>Go ahead. Kill him. Paul. </i>

1004
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:31,040
<i>Do something!</i>

1005
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:39,200
Call an ambulance.

1006
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:46,080
Call a fucking ambulance!

1007
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:10,880
<i>How many lives do we live?</i>

1008
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:14,240
<i>How many times do we die?</i>

1009
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:22,600
<i>They say we all lose 21 grams... </i>

1010
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:25,920
<i>at the exact moment of our death. </i>

1011
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:27,880
<i>Everyone. </i>

1012
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:33,920
<i>And how much fits
into 21 grams?</i>

1013
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:40,080
<i>How much is lost?</i>

1014
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:52,520
<i>When do we lose 21 grams?</i>

1015
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:08,920
<i>How much goes with them?</i>

1016
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:25,040
<i>How much is gained?</i>

1017
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:37,280
<i>How much is gained?</i>

1018
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:51,080
<i>Twenty-one grams. </i>

1019
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:54,840
<i>The weight
of a stack of five nickels. </i>

1020
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:56,960
<i>The weight of a hummingbird. </i>

1021
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:00,240
<i>A chocolate bar. </i>

1022
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:05,120
<i>How much did 21 grams weigh?</i>

1023
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,680
<i>  One last kiss </i>

1024
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:47,360
<i>  One only </i>

1025
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:50,280
<i>  Then I'll let you go </i>

1026
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:55,280
<i>  Hard for you </i>

1027
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:58,560
<i>  I've fallen </i>

1028
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:01,600
<i>  But you can't break my fall </i>

1029
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:06,680
<i>  I'm broken </i>

1030
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:10,240
<i>  Don't break me </i>

1031
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:13,160
<i>  When I hit the ground </i>

1032
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:17,920
<i>  Some devil </i>

1033
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:21,520
<i>  Some angel </i>

1034
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:24,960
<i>  Has got me to the bones </i>

1035
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:33,600
<i>  You said always and forever </i>

1036
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:37,880
<i>  Now I believe you, baby </i>

1037
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:44,080
<i>  You said always and forever </i>

1038
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:50,200
<i>  Is such a long
and lonely time </i>

1039
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:07,680
<i>  Too drunk and still drinking </i>

1040
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:10,720
<i>  It's just the way I feel </i>

1041
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:15,680
<i>  It's all right </i>

1042
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:19,360
<i>  Is what you told me </i>

1043
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:24,200
<i>  'Cause what we had
was so beautiful </i>

1044
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:27,480
<i>  But I feel heavy </i>

1045
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:30,760
<i>  Like floating </i>

1046
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:35,640
<i>  At the bottom of the sea </i>

1047
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:41,920
<i>  You said always and forever </i>

1048
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:47,200
<i>  Now I believe you, baby </i>

1049
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:54,520
<i>  You said always and forever </i>

1050
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:59,720
<i>  Is such a long
and lonely time </i>

1051
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:17,000
<i>  Some devil is
stuck inside of me </i>

1052
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:21,120
<i>  I cannot set it free </i>

1053
01:58:21,200 --> 01:58:23,840
<i>  I wish, I wish I was dead </i>

1054
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:28,520
<i>  And you were grieving </i>

1055
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:31,920
<i>  Just so that you could know </i>

1056
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:40,080
<i>  Some angel is
stuck inside of me </i>

1057
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:43,480
<i>  But I cannot set you free </i>

1058
01:58:45,240 --> 01:58:51,400
<i>  You said always and forever </i>

1059
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:56,640
<i>  Now I believe you, baby </i>

1060
01:58:56,680 --> 01:59:02,960
<i>  You said always and forever </i>

1061
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:09,040
<i>  Such a long, lonely time </i>

1062
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,920
<i>  Stuck inside of me </i>
