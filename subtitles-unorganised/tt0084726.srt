1
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,151
Captain's Log. Stardate 8130.3.

2
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,238
Starship Enterprise on
training mission to Gamma Hydra.

3
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,798
Section 14, coordinates: 22/87/4.

4
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,710
Approaching Neutral Zone,
all systems normal and functioning.

5
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,878
Leaving Section 14 for Section 15.

6
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,077
Stand by. Project parabolic course
to avoid entering Neutral Zone.

7
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,032
Course change projected.

8
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,789
Captain! I'm getting something
on the distress channel.

9
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,630
Imperative! This is the Kobayashi
Maru, 19 periods out of Altair Six.

10
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,631
We have struck a gravitic mine
and have lost all power...

11
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,790
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Can you give us your coordinates?

12
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,278
Enterprise, our position is
Gamma Hydra, Section 10.

13
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,754
In the Neutral Zone.

14
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,511
Hull penetrated, life support
systems failing. Can you assist us?

15
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,278
Data on Kobayashi Maru.

16
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,952
Third class neutronic fuel carrier,
crew of 81. 300 passengers.

17
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,912
Damn!

18
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,037
Mr Sulu? Plot an intercept course.

19
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,397
May I remind the Captain
that if a Starship enters the Zone...

20
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,353
I'm aware of
my responsibilities, Mister.

21
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,277
Estimating two minutes to intercept.

22
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,312
- Now entering the Neutral Zone.
- Warning. Neutral Zone entered.

23
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,150
We are now in violation of Treaty.

24
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,158
Stand by, Transporter Room,
ready to beam survivors aboard.

25
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,954
Captain! I've lost their signal.

26
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,551
Sensors indicate three Klingon
cruisers, bearing 316 mark 4.

27
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,716
- Closing fast.
- Visual.

28
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,714
Battle stations! Activate shields!

29
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,552
- Shields activated!
- Say we are on a rescue mission.

30
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,117
- They're jamming all frequencies.
- Klingons on attack course...

31
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,836
We're in over our heads.
Mr Sulu! Get us out of here!

32
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,759
Alert! Klingon torpedoes activated.

33
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,712
Evasive action!

34
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,798
- Engineering! Damage report!
- Main energiser hit!

35
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,878
Engage auxiliary power!
Prepare to return fire!

36
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,275
Shields collapsing, Captain!

37
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,751
- Fire all phasers!
- No power to the weapons, Captain.

38
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,553
Captain, it's no use!
We're dead in space!

39
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,797
Activate escape pods! Send out
the Log Buoy. All hands abandon ship.

40
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,195
All right. Open her up.

41
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,033
- Any suggestions, Admiral?
- Prayer, Mr Saavik.

42
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,391
The Klingons don't take prisoners.

43
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,079
Lights!

44
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,236
Motors on!

45
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,436
Captain?

46
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,554
Trainees... to the briefing room.

47
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,036
Maintenance Crew,
report to Bridge Simulator.

48
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,073
Maintenance Crew,
report to Bridge Simulator.

49
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,636
- Physician, heal thyself.
- Is that all you've got to say?

50
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,559
- What about my performance?
- I'm not a drama critic.

51
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,076
Are you gonna stay
with the sinking ship?

52
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,511
- Permission to speak candidly, sir?
- Granted.

53
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,235
I don't believe this was
a fair test of my command abilities.

54
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,318
There was no way to win.

55
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,193
Every commander may face
a no-win situation.

56
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,279
- Has that never occurred to you?
- No, sir. It has not.

57
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,998
How we deal with death is at least
as important as how we deal with life.

58
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,237
As I indicated, that thought
had not occurred to me.

59
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,796
Well, now you have
something new to think about.

60
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,200
Admiral? Wouldn't it be easier to put
an experienced crew back on the ship?

61
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,749
Galloping around the cosmos
is a game for the young, Doctor.

62
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,190
What is that supposed to mean?

63
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,591
Aren't you dead?

64
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,034
You want to learn what efficiency
rating I'll give your cadets?

65
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,708
I am understandably curious.

66
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,071
They destroyed
the Simulator Room and you with it.

67
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,840
The Kobayashi Maru scenario
frequently wreaks havoc

68
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,717
with students and equipment.
You took the test three times yourself.

69
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,071
Your final solution was,
shall we say... unique.

70
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,669
It had the virtue
of never having been tried.

71
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,236
Oh, by the way... thank you for this.

72
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,238
I know of your fondness for antiques.

73
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,193
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times..."

74
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,312
- Message, Spock?
- None that I'm conscious of.

75
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,718
Except, of course, happy birthday.
Surely, the best of times.

76
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,710
Captain Spock, Captain Spock,
space shuttle leaving in 15 minutes.

77
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,911
- Where are you off to?
- The Enterprise.

78
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,351
I must check in
before your inspection. And you?

79
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,236
Home.

80
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,151
Doctor! What beams you
into this neck of the woods?

81
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,511
"Beware of Romulans bearing gifts."

82
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,278
- Happy birthday, Jim!
- Thanks.

83
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,077
Romulan ale!
Bones, you know this is illegal.

84
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,431
I only use it for medicinal purposes.
I got aboard a ship

85
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,677
that brings in a case now and then
across the Neutral Zone.

86
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,235
- Now, don't be a prig.
- 2283.

87
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,432
Yeah, well, it takes this stuff
a while to ferment.

88
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,111
Here, give me that.
Now, you open this one.

89
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,276
I'm almost afraid to.

90
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,597
What is it? Klingon aphrodisiacs?

91
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,074
No.

92
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,717
Oh, Bones... this is... charming.

93
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,754
For most patients your age,
I recommend Retinax Five.

94
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,032
- I'm allergic to Retinax.
- Exactly. Cheers!

95
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,514
Cheers.

96
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,432
Happy birthday.

97
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,159
- I don't know what to say.
- You could say thank you.

98
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,759
Thank you.

99
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,953
Damn it, Jim!
What's the matter with you?

100
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,549
Why are we treating
your birthday like a funeral?

101
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,038
- Bones, I don't want to be lectured.
- What the hell do you want?

102
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,354
This is not about age.
And you know it.

103
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,872
It's about you flying a computer
when you want to be hopping galaxies!

104
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,719
Spare me your notions of poetry.
We all have our duties.

105
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,155
Bull! You're hiding,
hiding behind rules and regulations.

106
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,114
- Who am I hiding from?
- From yourself, Admiral!

107
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,795
Don't mince words, Bones.
What do you really think?

108
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,553
Jim...

109
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,910
I'm your doctor and I'm your friend.

110
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,394
Get back your command.

111
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,354
Get it back before you turn
into part of this collection.

112
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,039
Before you really do grow old.

113
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,430
Starship Log. Stardate 8130.4.

114
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,279
Log Entry by
First Officer Pavel Chekov.

115
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,836
Starship Reliant on orbital
approach to Ceti Alpha Six,

116
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,508
in connection with Project Genesis.

117
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,110
We keep searching for a lifeless
planet, to satisfy the requirements

118
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,438
of a test site for the Genesis
Experiment. So far, no success.

119
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,156
Standard orbit, please. Mr Beach,
any change in the surface scan?

120
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,195
Negative. Limited atmosphere
dominated by craylon gas, sand,

121
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,870
high velocity winds.
Incapable of supporting lifeforms.

122
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,596
Does it have to be
completely lifeless?

123
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,870
You've found something?

124
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,198
We've picked up a minor energy flux
reading on one dyno scanner.

125
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,632
Damn. Are you sure? Maybe
the scanner's out of adjustment.

126
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,668
I suppose it could be a particle
of pre-animate matter,

127
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,075
caught in the matrix.

128
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,955
All right.
Get on the Comm-pic to Dr Marcus.

129
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,154
Maybe it's something we can transplant?

130
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,316
You know what she'll say.

131
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,150
Now, let me get this straight.
Something you can transplant?

132
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,079
Something you can transplant?

133
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,478
I don't know.

134
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,114
It may only be a particle
of pre-animate matter.

135
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,677
Then again, it may not.
You boys have to be clear on this.

136
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,236
There can't be so much as a microbe,
or the show's off!

137
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,477
Have a look. But if it is
something that can be moved...

138
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,513
You bet, Doctor. We're on our way.

139
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,228
Don't have kittens,
Genesis is going to work.

140
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,591
They'll remember you in one breath
with Newton, Einstein, Surak!

141
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,758
Thanks a lot.
No respect from my offspring.

142
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,509
Par for the course. Are you teaming
up with me for bridge after dinner?

143
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,278
Maybe.

144
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,232
What is it?

145
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,837
Every time we have dealings
with Starfleet, I get nervous.

146
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,429
We are dealing with something that...

147
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,757
...could be perverted
into a dreadful weapon.

148
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,075
That overgrown Boy Scout you used
to know is exactly the kind of man...

149
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,035
Jim Kirk was many things,
but he was never a Boy Scout!

150
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,077
Captain Terrell,
stand by to beam down.

151
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,549
Chekov, are you sure
these are the correct coordinates?

152
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,799
Captain, this is the garden spot
of Ceti Alpha Six.

153
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,436
I can barely see it.

154
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,753
There's nothing here!
The Tricorder must be broken.

155
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,039
Chekov! Over here!

156
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,752
Those look like cargo carriers.

157
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,629
Hey, give me a hand.

158
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,350
What the hell happened?

159
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,996
If they crashed,
where's the rest of the ship?

160
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,796
What the hell is that?

161
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,956
Botany Bay...

162
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,956
Botany Bay?!

163
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,592
Oh, no!

164
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,556
We've got to get
out of here now! Damn!

165
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,593
- What about the...
- Never mind that! Hurry!

166
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,234
Chekov, what's the matter with you?

167
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,271
Chekov!

168
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,277
Come on! Hurry!

169
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,156
Starship Reliant to Captain Terrell.

170
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,239
This is Commander Kyle.
Will you please respond, Captain?

171
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,192
Captain Terrell! Respond, please!

172
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,275
Let's give them a little more time.

173
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,874
Khan!

174
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,396
I don't know you.

175
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,356
But you...

176
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,430
I never forget a face.

177
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,596
Mister...

178
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,474
...Chekov!

179
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,636
Isn't it?

180
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,428
I'd never thought
to see your face again.

181
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,996
- Chekov, who is this man?
- A criminal, Captain.

182
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,476
A product of late 20th century
genetic engineering.

183
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,831
- What do you want? Sir, I demand...
- You are in a position

184
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,679
to demand nothing, sir.

185
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:39,191
I, on the other hand,
am in a position to grant... nothing.

186
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,359
What you see is all that remains
of the ship's company and crew

187
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,437
of the Botany Bay...

188
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:51,078
...marooned here 15 years ago
by Captain James T. Kirk.

189
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,274
- Listen! You men and women...
- Captain! Captain...

190
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,233
Save your strength.

191
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,477
These people have sworn
to live and die at my command

192
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,831
200 years before you were born.

193
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,429
Do you mean...
he never told you the tale?

194
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,790
To amuse your captain? No?

195
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,314
Never told how the Enterprise picked
up the Botany Bay, lost in space,

196
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,072
in the year 1996, myself and the
ship's company in cryogenic freeze?

197
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,955
- I've never even met Admiral Kirk.
- Admiral?

198
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,513
Admiral?!

199
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,516
Admiral...

200
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,390
Never told you how... Admiral Kirk
sent 70 of us into exile

201
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,672
on this barren sand heap,

202
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,237
with only the contents
of these cargo bays to sustain us?

203
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,910
You lie! On Ceti Alpha Five
there was life!

204
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,193
- A fair chance!
- This is Ceta Alpha Five!

205
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,635
Ceti Alpha Six exploded
six months after we were left here.

206
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:23,118
The shock shifted the orbit of this
planet and everything was laid waste!

207
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,952
Admiral Kirk... never bothered
to check on our progress.

208
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,428
It was only the fact of
my genetically engineered intellect

209
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,996
that allowed us to survive.

210
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,191
On Earth...

211
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,230
...200 years ago...

212
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,000
...I was a prince...

213
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,311
...with power over millions!

214
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,718
Captain Kirk was your host!
You repaid his hospitality

215
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,753
by trying to steal his ship
and murder him!

216
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,515
You didn't expect to find me.

217
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,191
You thought this was...
Ceti Alpha Six!

218
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,116
Why are you here?

219
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,996
Why?!

220
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,559
Allow me to introduce you
to Ceti Alpha Five's only remaining

221
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,150
indigenous lifeform.

222
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,995
What do you think?

223
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,397
They've killed 20 of my people.

224
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,150
Including my beloved wife.

225
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,309
Oh, not all at once.

226
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,433
And not... instantly, to be sure.

227
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,316
You see, their young
enter through the ears...

228
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,750
...and wrap themselves
around the cerebral cortex.

229
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,509
This has the effect of rendering
the victim extremely susceptible

230
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,631
to suggestion.

231
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,348
Later, as they... grow...

232
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,916
...follows madness.

233
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,716
And death.

234
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,711
Khan! Listen to me!

235
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,230
These are pets, of course.

236
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,355
Not quite domesticated.

237
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,795
Khan... Captain Kirk
was only doing his duty.

238
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,478
No!

239
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,196
That's better.

240
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,832
Now, tell me... Why are you here?

241
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,918
And tell me where I may find...

242
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,474
...James Kirk.

243
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,875
Enterprise to
Admiral Kirk's shuttle.

244
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,153
You're cleared for docking.
Approach portside torpedo bay.

245
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,711
Enterprise, this is Admiral Kirk's
party on final approach.

246
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,515
Enterprise welcomes you.
Prepare for docking.

247
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,591
I hate inspections.

248
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,390
I'm delighted. Any chance
to go aboard the Enterprise.

249
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,557
I am glad to have you
at the helm for three weeks.

250
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,115
I don't think these kids can steer.

251
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,677
Open the airlock.

252
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,633
- Permission to come aboard, Captain.
- Welcome. You know my training crew.

253
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,717
They certainly know you.

254
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,276
Yes. We've been through
death and life together.

255
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,996
Mr Scott, you old space dog!
You're well?

256
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,590
I had a wee bout, sir,
but Dr McCoy pulled me through.

257
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,758
- A wee bout of what?
- Shore leave, Admiral.

258
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,556
- And who is this?
- Midshipman First Class.

259
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,548
- Peter Preston, engineer's mate!
- First training voyage?

260
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,196
- Yes, sir!
- I see.

261
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,392
Well... shall we start
with the Engine Room?

262
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,716
We'll see you there.
Everything is in order.

263
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,117
That'll be a pleasant surprise,
Mr Scott.

264
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,110
I'll see you on the bridge, Admiral.
Company dismissed!

265
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:18,398
Mr Scott, are your cadets capable
of handling a minor training cruise?

266
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,832
- Give the word, Admiral!
- Mr Scott, the word is given.

267
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,918
Admiral, what about
the rest of the inspection?

268
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,031
Later.

269
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,272
This is Starfleet Operations.
Enterprise is cleared for departure.

270
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,835
Admiral on the bridge.

271
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,430
Very well, Mr Saavik.
You may clear all moorings.

272
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,030
- All moorings are clear, Captain.
- Thank you.

273
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,717
Lieutenant? Have you ever piloted
a Starship out of spacedock?

274
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,195
Never, sir.

275
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,833
Take her out, Mr Saavik.

276
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,396
Aye, sir.

277
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:48,837
For everything there is a first time,
Lieutenant. Don't you agree, Admiral?

278
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,749
- Aft thrusters, Mr Sulu.
- Aft thrusters.

279
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,950
- Would you like a tranquilliser?
- Ahead one quarter impulse power.

280
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,239
- We are free and clear to navigate.
- Course heading, Captain?

281
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,918
Captain's discretion.

282
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:18,238
Mr Sulu? You may... indulge yourself.

283
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,876
Aye, sir.

284
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,594
That about do it?

285
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,157
There can't be more information we
could squeeze into the memory banks.

286
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,079
- Next time we'll design a bigger one.
- Who'd build it?

287
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,319
Dr Marcus? Comm-Pic
coming in on hyperchannel.

288
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,672
- It's the Starship Reliant.
- On the screen, please, Jedda.

289
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,237
Come in, please. This is
the Reliant calling Regula One.

290
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,352
Repeat, this is USS Reliant.

291
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,189
Commander, we are receiving.
This is Regula One. Go ahead.

292
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:22,191
Dr Marcus. We're en route to you
and should be there in three days.

293
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,757
En route? Why? We weren't expecting
you for another three months.

294
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,080
- Has something happened?
- Ceti Alpha Six has checked out.

295
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,829
- Then I don't understand why you...
- We have received new orders.

296
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,397
Upon our arrival at Regula One,
all materials of Project Genesis

297
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,639
will be transferred to this ship
for testing on Ceti Alpha Six.

298
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,149
Who the hell do they think they are?

299
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,557
Commander Chekov,
this is completely irregular.

300
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,070
- I have my orders.
- Pin him down, Mother!

301
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,555
Who gave the order?

302
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,756
The order comes from...
Admiral James T. Kirk.

303
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,952
I knew it! All along
the military's wanted to get...

304
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,720
This is completely improper,
Commander Chekov!

305
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,913
I do not intend to allow Reliant
or any other unauthorised personnel

306
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,509
access to our work or materials.

307
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,794
I'm sorry that you feel that way.
The Admiral's orders are confirmed.

308
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,872
Please prepare to deliver Genesis
to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.

309
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,235
Well done, Commander.

310
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,389
You realise, sir, they will attempt
to contact Admiral Kirk

311
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,068
and confirm the order.

312
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,471
Hold, please.

313
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,916
Thank you, sir.

314
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,078
Lieutenant, are you wearing
your hair differently?

315
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,477
It's still regulation, Admiral.

316
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,956
May I speak, sir?

317
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,679
Self-expression doesn't seem
to be one of your problems.

318
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,230
You're bothered by your performance
on the Kobayashi Maru.

319
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,594
- I failed to resolve the situation.
- It's a test of character.

320
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,031
May I ask
how you dealt with the test?

321
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,155
You may ask.

322
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,071
That's a little joke.

323
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,432
Humour. It is a difficult concept.

324
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,156
- It is not logical.
- We learn by doing.

325
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,750
Who's been holding up
the damn elevator?

326
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,396
- Did she change her hairstyle?
- I hadn't noticed.

327
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,194
Wonderful stuff, that Romulan ale.

328
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,073
- Admiral Kirk?
- Kirk here.

329
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,831
An urgent Comm-Pic from Space Lab
Regula One for you. Dr Carol Marcus.

330
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,475
- I'll take it in my quarters, Uhura.
- It never rains but it pours.

331
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,871
As a physician, you should appreciate
the dangers of re-opening old wounds.

332
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,276
- Sorry.
- Jim, can you read me?

333
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,268
I can hear you, Carol.
What's the matter?

334
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,995
Why are you taking
Genesis away from us?

335
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,795
Taking Genesis?
Who is taking Genesis?

336
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,037
- I can see you, but I can't hear.
- Carol...

337
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:46,439
- Jim, did you give the order?
- What order? Who is taking Genesis?

338
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:52,033
Please help us! I won't let them
have Genesis without authorisation!

339
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,231
On whose authority
can they do this?

340
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,273
- No one's authority!
- Please do something.

341
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,837
- Uhura, what's happening?
- Transmission jammed at source.

342
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:09,358
Alert Starfleet Headquarters.
I want to talk to Starfleet Command.

343
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,550
We must have order in here.
This has to be some sort of mistake.

344
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,957
Mistake?! We're all alone here.

345
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,799
They waited until everyone
was on leave to do this.

346
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,594
Reliant is supposed
to be at our disposal.

347
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,837
- Starfleet clearly never intended...
- I know that, but...

348
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,033
I tried to tell you! Scientists have
always been pawns of the military.

349
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,356
Starfleet has kept the peace
for 100 years.

350
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,394
I cannot subscribe
to your interpretation of this event!

351
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,594
You may be right, Doctor. But what
about Reliant? She's on her way.

352
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,917
Something may be wrong in Regula One.
We've been ordered to investigate.

353
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,078
If memory serves, Regula One is
a scientific research laboratory.

354
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,149
I told Starfleet Command all we had
was a boatload of children.

355
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,670
But... we're the only ship
in the quadrant.

356
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,840
These cadets of yours, how will they
respond under real pressure?

357
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:22,272
As with all living things,
each according to his gifts.

358
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,074
Of course, this ship is yours.

359
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,716
No, that won't be necessary.
Just get me to Regula One.

360
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,630
As a teacher on a training mission,
I'm happy to command the Enterprise.

361
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:41,392
If we are to go on actual duty,
the senior officer must assume command.

362
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,160
It may be nothing.

363
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:49,673
Garbled communications.
You take the ship.

364
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,519
You proceed from a false assumption.

365
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,633
I'm a Vulcan.
I have no ego to bruise.

366
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,354
You remind me that logic
dictates your actions?

367
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,109
I would not remind you
of that which you know so well.

368
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,871
If I may be so bold, it was a mistake
for you to accept promotion.

369
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,310
Commanding a Starship
is your first, best destiny.

370
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,229
Anything else is a waste of material.

371
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,908
I would not presume to debate you.

372
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,076
That is wise.

373
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:28,637
In any case... were I to invoke logic,
logic clearly dictates

374
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,594
that the needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few.

375
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,109
Or the one.

376
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,272
You're my superior officer.
You are also my friend.

377
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,631
I have been
and always shall be yours.

378
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,790
Stop energisers. Prepare speakers.

379
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,549
An emergency situation has arisen.
By order of Starfleet Command,

380
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,309
as of now, 1800 hours,
I'm assuming command of this vessel.

381
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,193
Duty officer, so note in the log.
Plot a new course

382
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,790
for Space Laboratory Regula One.
Engine Room.

383
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,312
Mr Scott!
We'll be going to Warp Speed.

384
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,314
- Course plotted for Regula One.
- Engage Warp engines.

385
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,198
- Prepare for Warp Speed.
- Ready, sir.

386
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,111
I know that none of you were
expecting this. I'm sorry.

387
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,393
I'm going to have to ask you to grow
up a little sooner than you expected.

388
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,556
Warp Five, Sulu.

389
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,479
So much for
the little training cruise.

390
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,469
Course to intercept Enterprise
ready, sir.

391
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,036
- Helmsman?
- Sir. May I speak?

392
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,910
We're all with you, sir.

393
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,315
But consider this.

394
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,071
We are free. We have a ship
and the means to go where we will.

395
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,318
We have escaped
permanent exile on Ceti Alpha Five.

396
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,956
You have proved
your superior intellect...

397
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,799
...and defeated
the plans of Admiral Kirk.

398
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,718
You do not need to defeat him again.

399
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,638
He tasks me.

400
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,592
He tasks me, and I shall have him.

401
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,677
I'll chase him round
the moons of Nibia

402
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,193
and round the Antares maelstrom
and round perdition's flames

403
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,758
before I give him up!
Prepare to alter course.

404
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,832
Space Station Regula One,
please come in.

405
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,873
Dr Marcus, please respond.

406
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,795
This is Enterprise call...

407
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,195
There's no response
from Regula One.

408
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,437
- But no longer jammed?
- No, sir. No nothing!

409
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,838
There are two possibilities.
They're unable or unwilling to respond.

410
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,635
- How far?
- 12 hours 43 minutes, present speed.

411
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:31,275
Give up Genesis, she said. What does
that mean? Give it up to whom?

412
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:36,918
It might help if I knew what Genesis
was, beyond the biblical reference.

413
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,078
Uhura, have Dr McCoy
join us in my quarters.

414
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,636
Mr Saavik? You have the con.

415
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,156
I've got Sick Bay ready. Will someone
please tell me what's going on?

416
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,636
Computer. Request security procedure

417
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,115
and access to
Project Genesis summary.

418
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,228
Identify for retina scan.

419
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,670
Kirk... Admiral James T.

420
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,475
Security Scan approved.

421
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,272
Summary, please?

422
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,357
Project Genesis.
A proposal to the Federation.

423
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,677
- Carol Marcus.
- Yes.

424
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,758
What exactly is Genesis?

425
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,670
Well, put simply,
Genesis is life from lifelessness.

426
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,917
It is a process whereby
molecular structure is reorganised

427
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:45,035
at the sub-atomic level into life-
generating matter of equal mass.

428
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,232
Stage One of our experiments
was conducted in the laboratory.

429
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,399
Stage Two will be attempted
in a lifeless underground.

430
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,559
Stage Three will involve
the process on a planetary scale.

431
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,797
It is our intention to introduce
the Genesis device

432
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,472
into a pre-selected area of a lifeless
space body, such as a moon.

433
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,513
The device is delivered,
instantaneously causing

434
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,314
what we call the Genesis Effect.

435
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,479
Matter is reorganised
with life-generating results.

436
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,913
Instead of a dead moon,
a living, breathing planet

437
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:37,557
capable of sustaining whatever
lifeforms we deposit on it.

438
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,193
Fascinating.

439
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,155
The moon simulated here represents
a fraction of Genesis' potential,

440
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:49,229
should the Federation wish to fund
the experiment to its conclusion.

441
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,592
When we consider the cosmic problems
of population and food supply,

442
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,473
the usefulness of this process
becomes clear.

443
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,070
This concludes our proposal.
Thank you for your attention.

444
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,228
It literally is Genesis.

445
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,715
The power of creation.

446
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,717
- Have they proceeded?
- The tape was made a year ago.

447
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,390
I can only assume
they've reached Stage Two by now.

448
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,593
But, dear Lord, do you think
we're intelligent enough to...

449
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,271
Suppose... What if this thing
were used where life already exists?

450
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,519
It would destroy such life...
in favour of its new matrix.

451
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,794
Its new matrix? Do you have any idea
what you're saying?

452
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,788
I was not attempting
to evaluate its moral implications.

453
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,835
In cosmic history it has always been
easier to destroy than to create.

454
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,157
Not any more! Now we can do
both at the same time.

455
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,193
According to myth,
Earth was created in six days.

456
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,439
Now watch out! Here comes Genesis!
We'll do it for you in six minutes!

457
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,599
Really, Dr McCoy, you must learn
to govern your passions.

458
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,076
They will be your undoing.
Logic suggests...

459
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,875
Logic?! My God,
the man's talking about logic!

460
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,072
We're talking about
universal Armageddon!

461
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,352
- You green-blooded, inhuman...
- Bridge to Admiral Kirk.

462
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,838
Sensors indicate a vessel
in our area, closing fast.

463
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:21,831
- What do you make of her?
- It's one of ours. It's Reliant.

464
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,640
Try the emergency channels.

465
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,913
Picture, Mr Saavik.

466
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,709
Slow to one-half impulse power.

467
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,230
- Let's be friends.
- Slowing to one-half impulse power.

468
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,718
Reliant in our section.
This quadrant, sir. And slowing.

469
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,038
Sir? May I quote General Order 12?
"On the approach of any vessel,

470
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,595
"when communications
have not been established..."

471
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,236
The Admiral is well aware
of the regulations.

472
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,714
Aye, sir.

473
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,551
Is it possible
their Comm system has failed?

474
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,432
It would explain many things.

475
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,678
They're requesting
communications, sir.

476
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,359
Let them eat static!

477
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,748
They're still running
with shields down.

478
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,236
Of course!
We are one big happy fleet!

479
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:40,799
Ah, Kirk, my old friend! Do you know
the Klingon proverb that tells us,

480
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,232
"Revenge is a dish
that is best served cold?"

481
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,837
It is very cold... in space.

482
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,635
This is damned peculiar.

483
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,112
- Yellow Alert!
- Energise defence fields!

484
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:19,477
A voice. They say their Chambers coil
is overloading their Comm system.

485
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,956
Scanning.
Their coil emissions are normal!

486
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,390
- Their shields are still down.
- Raise ours.

487
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,593
- Their shields are going up!
- Lock phasers on target.

488
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,353
Locking phasers on target.

489
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,391
- They're locking phasers.
- Raise shields.

490
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,750
Fire!

491
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,030
- Sulu, get those shields up!
- Trying, sir.

492
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,436
I can't get power, sir!

493
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,998
Scotty?

494
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,839
- Uhura, turn off those channels!
- Mr Scott on the screen.

495
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,750
We're just hanging on, sir!
The main energiser's out!

496
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,032
- Try auxiliary power!
- Aye, sir.

497
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,196
Damage report.

498
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:49,355
- They knew exactly where to hit us.
- Who knew where to hit us? And why?

499
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,599
One thing is certain.
We cannot escape on auxiliary power.

500
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,076
Visual!

501
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,990
- Sulu, divert all power to phasers.
- Too late.

502
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,156
Hang on!

503
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,748
Scotty! What's left?

504
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,236
Just the batteries! I can have
auxiliary power in a few minutes!

505
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,749
We don't have a few minutes!

506
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,153
- Can you give me phaser power?
- A few shots!

507
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,715
- Not enough against their shields.
- Who are they?

508
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,992
Admiral! The commander
of the Reliant is signalling!

509
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,317
He wishes to discuss
terms of our surrender.

510
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,238
Visual on screen.

511
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,671
Do it! While we still have time.

512
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,874
On screen, sir.

513
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:13,073
- Khan!
- You still remember, Admiral.

514
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,748
I cannot help but be touched.

515
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,269
I, of course, remember you!

516
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,473
What is the meaning of this attack?!
Where is the crew of the Reliant?

517
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,036
Surely I have made
my meaning plain.

518
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,471
I mean to avenge myself
upon you, Admiral.

519
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:34,908
I've deprived your ship of power
and will deprive you of your life!

520
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,198
But I wanted you to know first
who it was who had beaten you.

521
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,556
Khan...

522
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,388
If it's me you want...

523
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,229
...l'll have myself beamed aboard.
Spare my crew!

524
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,434
I make you a counter-proposal.
I'll agree to your terms if...

525
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:02,316
...if... in addition to yourself,
you hand over to me

526
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:07,594
all data and material regarding
the project called... Genesis.

527
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,034
- Genesis? What's that?
- Don't insult my intelligence.

528
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,752
Give me some time to recall
the data on our computers.

529
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,918
I give you 60 seconds, Admiral.

530
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,596
Clear the bridge.

531
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,517
At least we know
he doesn't have Genesis.

532
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,553
Keep nodding as though
I'm still giving orders.

533
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,390
Mr Saavik, punch up the data charts
of Reliant's command console.

534
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,874
- Hurry!
- 45 seconds.

535
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,798
The prefix code?

536
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,309
- The chart's up, sir.
- Admiral!

537
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,476
We're finding it.

538
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,916
- Admiral!
- Please.

539
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:04,318
Please, give us time. The bridge is
smashed, the computers inoperative.

540
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,988
Time is a luxury
you don't have, Admiral.

541
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,430
Damn!

542
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,552
- Admiral?
- It's coming through now, Khan.

543
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,155
Reliant's prefix number is 16309.

544
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,679
I don't understand.

545
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,599
You have to learn
why things work on a Starship.

546
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,836
Each ship has its own
combination code.

547
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:37,999
To prevent an enemy from doing
what we're attempting.

548
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:42,671
Using our console to order Reliant
to lower her shields.

549
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,111
Assuming he hasn't
changed the combination.

550
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,629
Fifteen seconds.

551
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,988
Khan, how do we know
you'll keep your word?

552
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,192
I've given you no word
to keep, Admiral.

553
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,278
In my judgment,
you simply have no alternative.

554
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,874
I see your point.

555
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,038
Stand by to receive our transmission.

556
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:15,517
Mr Sulu, lock phasers on target
and await my command.

557
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,274
Time's up... Admiral.

558
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,232
Here it comes.

559
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,156
Now, Mr Spock.

560
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,750
Sir! Our shields are dropping!

561
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,115
Raise them!

562
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,197
I can't!

563
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,550
Where's the override?!

564
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,398
Fire!

565
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,674
Fire!

566
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,112
Fire! Fire!

567
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,550
- We can't fire!
- Why can't you?

568
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,912
They've damaged the photon control
and the Warp Drive. We must withdraw.

569
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,156
- No! No!
- Sir, we must!

570
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:12,879
The Enterprise can wait!
She's not going anywhere!

571
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,913
- Sir, you did it!
- I did nothing!

572
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,670
Except get caught with my breeches
down. I must be getting senile.

573
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,873
Mr Saavik? You go right on
quoting regulations!

574
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,629
In the meantime, let's find out
how badly we've been hurt.

575
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,110
- Is the word given, Admiral?
- The word is given.

576
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,596
Warp Speed.

577
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,236
Aye.

578
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,913
He stayed at his post...
when the trainees ran!

579
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,669
- Admiral? This is Spock.
- Yes, Spock?

580
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,474
Engine Room reports
auxiliary power restored.

581
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,672
We can proceed at impulse power.

582
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,110
Best speed to Regula One. Kirk out.

583
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,311
I'm sorry, Scotty.

584
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,077
Approaching Regula
and Space Lab Regula One.

585
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:14,876
Space Station Regula One, this is
the Starship Enterprise. Come in.

586
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,112
Space Station Regula One,
do you read?

587
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:29,072
Space Station Regula One, this is
Enterprise. Please acknowledge.

588
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,431
This is Enterprise.
Do you read me?

589
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,950
Space Station Regula One,
do you read? Please come in.

590
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,833
There's no response, sir.

591
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,159
Sensors, Captain?

592
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,911
Still inoperative. There's no way
to ascertain what's inside the station.

593
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,998
No way of telling
if Reliant is still in the area.

594
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,956
What do you make
of that planetoid beyond?

595
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,674
Regula is class 'D'. It consists

596
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:04,510
of various unremarkable ores.
Essentially a great rock in space.

597
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:09,475
- Reliant could be behind the rock.
- A distinct possibility.

598
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,231
- Engineering?
- Aye, sir.

599
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:16,319
Mr Scott? Do you have
enough power for transporters?

600
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,476
Barely, sir.

601
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,755
- I'm going down there.
- Khan could be there!

602
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,236
He's been there, hasn't found
what he wants. Who can you spare?

603
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,714
I can spare me.

604
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,833
Begging your pardon. General Order
15: "No flag officer shall beam

605
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,759
"into a hazardous area
without armed escort."

606
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,474
There's no such regulation!

607
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:44,077
All right, join the party.
Mr Spock, the ship is yours.

608
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,072
Jim, be careful.

609
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,555
We will!

610
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,073
Indeterminate life signs.

611
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,075
Phasers on stun.

612
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,951
Move out.

613
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,593
Jim!

614
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:40,113
Rigor hasn't set in. This couldn't
have happened too long ago.

615
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,594
Carol...!

616
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,588
Enterprise calling Space Lab
Regula One. Respond, please.

617
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,635
Admiral! Over here.

618
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,832
Dr Marcus, come in, please!

619
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,874
Oh, my God!

620
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:19,231
Please acknowledge signal! Please...

621
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,638
This is Lieutenant Saavik.
We're all right. Please stand by.

622
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,195
Oh, sir! It was Khan!

623
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,313
- We found him on Ceti Alpha Five.
- Easy...

624
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,911
He... put... creatures in our bodies!

625
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,475
To control our minds!

626
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,476
It's all right. You're safe now.

627
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,638
Made us say lies... do things.

628
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,515
But we beat him. He thought
he controlled us, but he did not!

629
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,590
- The Captain was strong.
- Captain...

630
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:01,271
Where's Dr Marcus?
Where are the Genesis materials?

631
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:05,029
He couldn't find them.
Even the data banks were empty.

632
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:09,472
- Erased?
- He tortured those people.

633
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,355
But none of them would
tell him anything. He went wild.

634
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:19,351
He slit their throats.
He wanted to tear the place apart.

635
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:24,475
But he was late. He had to get back
to Reliant to blow you to bits!

636
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,797
Where's Reliant's crew? Dead?

637
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,832
Marooned on Ceti Alpha Five.

638
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:35,555
He's mad. He blames you
for the death of his wife.

639
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,752
I know what he blames me for.

640
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:47,591
The escape pods are all in place.
Where's the Transporter Room?

641
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:52,192
- Did he make it down here?
- It was not my impression.

642
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:57,190
He spent most of the time trying to
wring information out of the people.

643
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,951
The unit's been left on. This means
nobody remained to turn it off.

644
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,392
Those people bought escape time
for Genesis with their lives.

645
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:11,071
This is not logical. These
coordinates are deep inside Regula.

646
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,238
A planetoid we know to be lifeless.

647
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,357
If Stage Two was completed,
it was going to be underground.

648
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:23,553
- Underground, she said!
- Stage Two of what?

649
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,150
- Kirk to Enterprise.
- Spock here.

650
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,272
Captain Spock, damage report.

651
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:35,508
If we go by the book, like Saavik,
hours could seem like days.

652
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,116
- Let's have it, Captain.
- The situation is grave.

653
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,788
We won't have main power
for six days.

654
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,639
Auxiliary power
has temporarily failed.

655
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:50,994
Restoration may be possible
in two days... by the book, Admiral.

656
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,077
You can't even beam us back?

657
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,236
Not at present.

658
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,795
Captain Spock. If you don't hear
from us within one hour,

659
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,719
your orders are to restore
what power you can,

660
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,354
take the Enterprise
to the nearest Starbase

661
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:08,949
and alert Starfleet Command
when out of jamming range.

662
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,310
Sir, we won't leave you behind!

663
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:15,877
Uhura, if you don't hear from us,
there won't be anybody behind.

664
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,634
Gentlemen, you can stay here, or...

665
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:23,799
If it's all the same, Admiral,
we'd like to share the risk.

666
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:27,597
Right. Let's go. Saavik.

667
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,632
- Go? Where are we going?
- Where they went.

668
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,070
Suppose they went nowhere?

669
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:40,034
Then this will be your big chance
to get away from it all.

670
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,591
Admiral...

671
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,200
Genesis, I presume.

672
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,599
Phasers down!

673
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,114
You!

674
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,395
- Where's Dr Marcus?
- I'm Dr Marcus!

675
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,079
Jim!

676
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:01,839
Is that David?

677
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,191
Mother! He killed everybody
we left behind.

678
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:11,276
Of course he didn't. David,
you're just making this harder.

679
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,029
I'm afraid it's even harder
than you think, Doctor.

680
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,993
Please don't move.

681
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,714
Chekov!

682
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,992
I'm... sorry, Admiral.

683
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,278
Your Excellency,
have you been listening?

684
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:34,153
I have indeed, Captain.
You have done well.

685
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,715
I knew it! You son-of-a bitch!

686
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,198
- Don't move! Anybody!
- Captain? We are waiting.

687
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:46,435
- What's the delay?
- All is well, sir.

688
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,313
You have the coordinates
to beam up Genesis.

689
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:54,073
First things first, Captain.

690
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,788
Kill Admiral Kirk.

691
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,509
Sir, that is difficult. I...

692
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:15,076
- I try to obey, but...
- Kill him!

693
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,554
I...

694
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,630
Kill him, Terrell, now!

695
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,394
God's sakes!

696
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,276
What is it?

697
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,158
Khan, you bloodsucker!

698
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:19,876
You're gonna have to do your own
dirty work now! Do you hear me?

699
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,034
Kirk!

700
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:28,870
Kirk, you're still alive,
my old friend.

701
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:35,599
Still, "old friend"! You've managed
to kill just about everyone else,

702
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:39,839
but like a poor marksman,
you keep missing the target.

703
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,637
Perhaps I no longer need
to try, Admiral.

704
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,153
He can't take it!

705
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,196
Khan!

706
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,873
You've got Genesis,
but you don't have me!

707
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:17,996
You were going to kill me, Khan!
You're going to have to come here!

708
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,078
I've done far worse than kill you.

709
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,476
I've hurt you.

710
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,437
And I wish to go on... hurting you.

711
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,279
I shall leave you as you left me.

712
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,072
As you left her.

713
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:42,479
Marooned for all eternity,
in the centre of a dead planet.

714
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,712
Buried alive!

715
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,873
Buried alive!

716
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:50,559
Khan!

717
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,189
Khan!

718
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:06,949
This is Lieutenant Saavik calling
Enterprise. Can you read us?

719
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:09,958
- He's coming around.
- Pavel?

720
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:16,553
It's no use, Admiral.
They're still jamming all channels.

721
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,115
If Enterprise followed orders,
she's gone.

722
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:22,232
If she couldn't obey, she's finished.

723
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:25,228
So are we, it looks like.

724
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:30,233
I don't understand!
Who's responsible for all this?

725
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,998
Who is Khan?

726
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:35,590
- It's a long story.
- We appear to have plenty of time.

727
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,959
Is there anything to eat? I don't
know about you, but I'm starved.

728
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,469
How can you think of food now?

729
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:49,433
First order of business. Survival.

730
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:52,359
There is food in the Genesis cave.

731
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,917
Enough to last a lifetime...
if necessary.

732
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:01,509
We thought this was Genesis.

733
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,760
It took the Starfleet
Corps of Engineers

734
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,430
ten months in spacesuits
to tunnel out all this.

735
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,878
What we did in there,
we did in a day.

736
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:18,756
David, why don't you show Dr McCoy
and the Lieutenant our idea of food?

737
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:23,750
- We can't just sit here!
- Oh, yes, we can.

738
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:27,475
This is just to give us
something to do, isn't it?

739
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,471
Come on.

740
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:42,159
- Admiral?
- As your teacher, Mr Spock, says,

741
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:46,717
"I like to think that there
always are... possibilities."

742
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,509
I did what you wanted.

743
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,631
I stayed away.

744
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,279
Why didn't you tell me?

745
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:10,233
How can you ask me that?

746
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,670
Were we together?

747
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,030
Were we going to be?

748
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:18,038
You had your world
and I had mine.

749
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,390
And I wanted him in mine.

750
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,956
Not chasing through the universe
with his father!

751
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:39,157
Actually... he's a lot like you.

752
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,956
In many ways.

753
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,838
Please tell me what you're feeling.

754
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,478
There's a man out there
I haven't seen in 15 years,

755
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,830
who's trying to kill me.

756
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,469
You show me a son
that'd be happy to help him.

757
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,716
My son...

758
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:12,356
My life that could have been...

759
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,516
...and wasn't.

760
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,512
And what am I feeling?

761
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,116
Old.

762
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,796
Worn out.

763
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:37,871
Let me show you something...

764
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:42,949
...that'll make you feel young,
as when the world was new.

765
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,756
Impulse power restored.

766
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:03,475
Excellent. More than a match
for poor Enterprise.

767
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:26,399
You did all this in a day?

768
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,034
The matrix formed in a day.

769
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:34,109
The lifeforms grew later,
at a substantially accelerated rate.

770
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:42,395
Jim! This is fantastic!
Have you ever seen the like?

771
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,635
Can I cook or can't I?

772
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,159
Where is she?

773
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,111
Sir? May I ask you a question?

774
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,471
- What's on your mind, Lieutenant?
- The Kobayashi Maru.

775
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,875
Are you asking
if this is that scenario?

776
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:26,110
On the test, will you tell me what
you did? I would really like to know.

777
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:30,279
Lieutenant, you are looking
at the only Starfleet cadet

778
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:33,199
who ever beat the no-win scenario.

779
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,356
How?

780
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:39,439
I reprogrammed the simulation
so it was possible to rescue the ship.

781
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,631
- What?
- He cheated!

782
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,354
I changed the conditions of the test.

783
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:49,236
I got a commendation for original
thinking. I don't like to lose.

784
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:53,228
Then you never faced
that situation... faced death?

785
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,398
I don't believe in a no-win scenario.

786
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,238
- Spock. It's two hours. Ready?
- Right on schedule.

787
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:06,638
Just give us your coordinates
and we'll beam you aboard.

788
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,792
I don't like to lose.

789
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,788
But we were immobilised.
Captain Spock said it'd be two days.

790
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,310
Lieutenant, you of all people
go by the book. Spock!

791
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,715
- You know Dr Marcus.
- Of course.

792
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,959
- I'm taking this bunch to Sick Bay.
- By the book?

793
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:29,470
Regulation 46A. "If transmissions
are monitored during battle...

794
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:33,673
"...no uncoded messages
on an open channel."

795
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,233
- You lied.
- I exaggerated.

796
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:42,638
Hours instead of days.
Now we have minutes instead of hours.

797
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,474
- Inoperative below C-Deck.
- What is working?

798
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:52,877
We have partial main power.
Best we could do in two hours.

799
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,917
- Admiral on the bridge.
- Battle stations!

800
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,396
Tactical!

801
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,711
She can still outrun us...
and outgun us.

802
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:32,311
- But there is the Mutara Nebula.
- Scotty, can we make it inside?

803
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:36,149
The energiser's bypassed,
so don't give me too many bumps.

804
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:39,750
- No promises. On your way.
- Trouble with the nebula

805
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:43,475
is all that static discharge and gas
clouds our tactical display.

806
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:47,514
Visual won't function
and shields will be useless.

807
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,598
Sauce for the goose, Mr Saavik.

808
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:53,153
The odds will be even.

809
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,630
There she is!

810
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,831
There she is!

811
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,949
Not so wounded
as we were led to believe.

812
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,593
So much the better.

813
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:18,515
Estimating nebula penetration
in 2.2 minutes.

814
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,676
Reliant is closing.

815
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,513
If they go in there, we'll lose them.

816
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,153
Explain it to them.

817
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:49,028
- That was close.
- They don't want us going in there.

818
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,111
One minute to nebula perimeter.

819
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,240
Why are we slowing?

820
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:06,389
We daren't follow them into the
nebula. Our shields would be useless.

821
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:13,228
- They are reducing speed.
- Uhura, patch me in.

822
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,118
You're on, Admiral.

823
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:22,718
Admiral Kirk here. We tried it
your way, Khan. Game for a rematch?

824
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:26,518
Khan! I'm laughing

825
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:29,234
at the "superior intellect".

826
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:34,274
- Full impulse power.
- No, sir!

827
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,074
You have Genesis.
You can have whatever...

828
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,669
Full power! Damn you!

829
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:49,195
I'll say this for him,
he's consistent.

830
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:52,119
We are now entering
the Mutara Nebula.

831
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:03,029
Emergency lights.

832
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,116
Tactical.

833
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:36,156
Inoperative.

834
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,070
Raise the shields.

835
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:45,796
As I feared, sir, not functional.
I'm reducing speed.

836
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,594
Target, sir.

837
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:31,190
- Phaser lock inoperative.
- Best guess, Sulu. Fire when ready.

838
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,991
Aft torpedoes! Fire!

839
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,316
Hold your course.

840
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:15,473
Evasive starboard!

841
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,839
Fire!

842
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,670
Damage, Mr Scott?

843
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:54,555
Admiral, I've got to take
the mains off the line.

844
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:57,638
- The radiation...
- Scotty?!

845
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,436
Joachim!

846
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:06,076
Yours... is the... superior...

847
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,192
I shall avenge you!

848
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,879
Could you use another hand, Admiral?

849
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,314
Man the weapons console,
Mr Chekov.

850
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,719
- Spock.
- Sporadic energy readings.

851
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,673
Port side, aft.
Could be an impulse turn.

852
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,635
He won't break off now.

853
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:49,116
He followed me this far,
he'll be back.

854
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,555
But from where?

855
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:56,036
He's intelligent,
but not experienced.

856
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:00,028
His pattern indicates
two-dimensional thinking.

857
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:08,234
- Full stop.
- Full stop, sir.

858
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:13,396
Z-minus 10,000 metres.
Stand by photon torpedoes.

859
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:06,151
Torpedoes ready, sir.

860
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,311
Look sharp.

861
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:22,514
Fire!

862
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:30,154
Fire!

863
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:07,073
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant:
"Prepare to be boarded."

864
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:08,713
Aye, sir.

865
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,593
Commander, Reliant,
this is Enterprise.

866
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,633
Surrender and prepare
to be boarded.

867
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:20,675
Enterprise to Reliant. You are
ordered to surrender your vessel.

868
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:36,713
Reliant! Come in, Reliant. You are
ordered to surrender your vessel.

869
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:41,277
Enterprise to Reliant. You're ordered
to surrender your vessel. Respond.

870
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,114
No, Kirk.

871
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:00,835
The game's not over.

872
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:40,116
To the last...
I will grapple with thee!

873
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:58,029
Admiral? Scanning
an energy source on Reliant.

874
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:01,198
A pattern I've never seen before.

875
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,870
- It's the Genesis Wave!
- What?

876
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,674
They're on a build-up to detonation!

877
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,593
- How soon?
- We encoded four minutes.

878
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:18,156
- We'll beam aboard and stop it.
- You can't.

879
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:24,637
Scotty! I need Warp Speed
in three minutes, or we're all dead.

880
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,115
- No response, Admiral.
- Scotty!

881
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:32,029
Mr Sulu, get us out of here.
Best possible speed.

882
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,312
Are you out of your Vulcan mind?!
No human can tolerate that radiation!

883
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,910
As you are so fond of observing,
Doctor, I am not human.

884
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:23,394
- You're not going in there!
- Perhaps you're right.

885
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:27,673
- What is Mr Scott's condition?
- Well, I don't think that he...

886
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:32,593
I'm sorry, Doctor, I have
no time to discuss this logically.

887
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:38,077
Remember.

888
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:50,474
Spock! Get out of there! Spock!

889
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:52,557
Spock! Get out of there!

890
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:06,517
- Time from my mark?
- Two minutes ten seconds.

891
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:09,359
Engine Room! What's happening?

892
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:14,270
- Spock!
- You dumb ninny! Get out of there!

893
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:17,677
No! God, don't!

894
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,876
Time?

895
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,752
Three minutes, 30 seconds.

896
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:00,756
- Distance from Reliant?
- 4,000 kilometres.

897
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,520
We're not going to make it, are we?

898
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:16,114
No!

899
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:19,990
No! You can't get away!

900
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:26,399
From hell's heart, I stab at thee!

901
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:35,078
For hate's sake,
I spit my last breath... at thee!

902
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,870
- Sir! The mains are back on line!
- Bless you, Scotty. Go, Sulu!

903
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,554
My God, Carol. Look at it.

904
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:50,070
Engine Room? Well done, Scotty.

905
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:55,149
Jim! I think you'd better
get down here.

906
01:31:56,440 --> 01:32:00,035
- Bones?
- Better hurry.

907
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:05,196
Saavik, take the con.

908
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:34,549
No! You'll flood
the whole compartment!

909
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:37,991
- He'll die!
- Sir! He's dead already.

910
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:44,229
It's too late, Jim.

911
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:06,838
Spock!

912
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:39,235
Ship... out of danger?

913
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:43,071
Yes.

914
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:48,228
Don't grieve, Admiral.

915
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,351
It is logical.

916
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:58,955
The needs of the many... outweigh...

917
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:02,796
...the needs of the few.

918
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,676
Or the one.

919
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:17,832
I never took...
the Kobayashi Maru test.

920
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:21,077
Until now.

921
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,836
What do you think of my solution?

922
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:29,830
Spock...!

923
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:41,712
I have been...

924
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,309
...and always shall be...

925
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,476
...your friend.

926
01:34:51,680 --> 01:34:55,389
Live long... and prosper!

927
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:18,676
No!

928
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:42,553
We are assembled here today to pay
final respects to our honoured dead.

929
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:52,668
And yet it should be noted that,
in the midst of our sorrow,

930
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:55,678
this death takes place
in the shadow of new life.

931
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,235
The sunrise of a new world.

932
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:03,468
A world that our beloved comrade
gave his life to protect and nourish.

933
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:07,434
He did not feel his sacrifice
a vain or empty one.

934
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:11,838
And we will not debate his profound
wisdom at these proceedings.

935
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:16,998
Of my friend, I can only say this...

936
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:24,631
Of all the souls I have
encountered in my travels...

937
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,556
...his was the most...

938
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:32,716
...human.

939
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,835
Honours... hup!

940
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,119
Come.

941
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:03,879
I don't mean to intrude.

942
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:07,914
No, not at all.
I should be on the bridge.

943
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:13,432
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Would you like a drink?

944
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:16,200
Lieutenant Saavik was right.

945
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:20,274
You never have faced a death.

946
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:31,029
No, not like this.

947
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:35,236
I haven't faced death.

948
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:38,034
I've cheated death.

949
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,230
I've tricked my way out of death...

950
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:46,069
...and patted myself on the back
for my ingenuity.

951
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:52,038
- I know nothing.
- You knew enough to tell Saavik

952
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:56,916
that how we face death is at least
as important as how we face life.

953
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:01,236
- Just words.
- But good words.

954
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:06,159
That's where ideas begin.
Maybe you should listen to them.

955
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:13,472
I was wrong about you. And I'm sorry.

956
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:20,437
Is that what you came here to say?

957
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:21,914
Mainly.

958
01:39:28,040 --> 01:39:32,318
And also that I'm... proud...

959
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:37,590
...very proud... to be your son.

960
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:10,949
Captain's Log, Stardate 8141.6.
Starship Enterprise departing

961
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:15,711
for Ceti Alpha Five to pick up
the crew of USS Reliant.

962
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:17,876
All is well.

963
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:23,200
And yet, I can't help wondering
about the friend I leave behind.

964
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:26,631
"There are always possibilities,"
Spock said.

965
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:31,994
And if Genesis is indeed
"life from death",

966
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:35,158
I must return to this place again.

967
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:44,029
He's really not dead.
As long as we remember him.

968
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:54,477
"It's a far, far better thing I do
than I have ever done before.

969
01:40:56,760 --> 01:41:00,070
"A far better resting place

970
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:03,431
"that I go to than I've ever known."

971
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:06,076
Is that a poem?

972
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:12,033
Something Spock was trying
to tell me. On my birthday.

973
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:15,630
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?

974
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:20,198
Young.

975
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:25,638
I feel young.

976
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:38,192
Space, the final frontier.

977
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:44,917
These are the continuing voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

978
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:52,115
Her ongoing mission...
to explore strange new worlds.

979
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:57,633
To seek out new lifeforms
and new civilisations.

980
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:04,234
To boldly go...
where no man has gone before.

981
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:09,076
