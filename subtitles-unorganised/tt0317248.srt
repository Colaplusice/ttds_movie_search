00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,630
CITY OF GOD

2
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:13,322
Fuck, the chicken's got away!
Go after that chicken , man !

3
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,427
Get that chicken !

4
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,952
If it's a good photo,
I'II get a job at the paper.

5
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,062
-You think so, Rocket?
-Gotta take the risk.

6
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:48,598
You'd risk your Iife
for a picture? Forget it!

7
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:52,260
You think I want to meet up
with that motherfucking hood?

8
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:54,600
Get that chicken , bro!

9
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,907
Motherfucker!
I toId you to grab that chicken !

10
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,607
Outta my way!

11
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,718
Get that chicken !

12
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,373
If Li'I Ze catches you ,
he'II kiII you .

13
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,236
Yeah , weII ,
he's gotta find me first.

14
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,786
Hey, kid ! Get that chicken !

15
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:45,589
Get that chicken !

16
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,350
Shit! The cops!

17
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,461
Don't fucking run off!

18
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,161
Give me that.

19
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,967
Hey, MeIonhead !
You fucking fag !

20
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,506
A picture
couId change my Iife, but

21
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,811
in the City of God,
if you run away, they get you

22
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,046
and if you stay,
they get you too.

23
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,807
It's been that way ever
since I was a kid.

24
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,093
You're useIess, man !

25
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,734
-Go get the baII !
-Fucking useIess!

26
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,268
Hey, kid !

27
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,440
Give me the baII , I wanna pIay.

28
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,173
You wanna mess with me?

29
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,582
Fuck off.

30
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:47,777
What's your name?

31
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,655
Sorry,
I forgot to introduce myseIf.

32
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,154
My name's Rocket.

33
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,189
Some advice, Rocket.

34
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,793
Don't Iet Li'I Dice
touch that baII . He sucks.

35
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,362
You Iose, paI .

36
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:00,892
That's Shaggy.

37
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,591
To teII the story
of the City of God,

38
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,633
I have to start with him.

39
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:06,894
8. . .

40
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,301
9, 1 0, 1 1 . . .

41
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,601
But in order to teII
Shaggy's story,

42
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,842
I must teII the story
of the Tender Trio.

43
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,238
WeII , Shaggy?
The gas truck's coming .

44
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,313
What are you
fucking around for?

45
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,712
You're not gonna chicken out.

46
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:36,159
The notorious Tender Trio was
Iegendary in the City of God.

47
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,727
Shaggy,

48
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,428
CIipper,

49
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,865
and Goose.

50
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:48,375
Tagging aIong were aIways
Li'I Dice and Benny,

51
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,572
Shaggy's brother.

52
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,043
I never had the courage
to foIIow my brother, Goose.

53
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,526
Okay, Iet's go.

54
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:05,789
Come on , Goose.

55
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,523
Let's go!

56
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,194
Stop this fucker!

57
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,518
Stop or I'II shoot,
motherfucker!

58
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:30,750
Get out!

59
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,920
Hurry up, asshoIe!
Gimme the money!

60
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,629
Who wants gas?

61
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,943
More! You wanna die
for your boss' damn money?

62
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,240
ShitIoads of money here!

63
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,748
You see, asshoIe?

64
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:03,778
Fuck! The cops!

65
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,214
CIear out!
The pIace is crawling with cops!

66
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:18,197
-Shaggy!
-The baII , Goose, it's yours!

67
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,834
Back then, I thought
the guys in the Tender Trio

68
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,527
were the most dangerous hoods
in Rio.

69
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,541
Here! Buy some new baIIs.

70
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,775
But they were just amateurs.

71
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,711
Even my brother, Goose.

72
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,876
Rocket, give this money to dad .

73
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:11,579
But don't teII him
it's from me.

74
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,113
Okay?

75
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,485
-Hey, Stringy!
-Yeah?

76
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:17,891
Look how much I've got.

77
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,645
We came to the City of God

78
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,147
hoping to find paradise.

79
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,647
Many famiIies were homeIess

80
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,255
due to flooding

81
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,720
and acts of arson
in the sIums.

82
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:48,985
A street Iight!

83
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,059
We'II have eIectricity!

84
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,323
The bigwigs in government
didn't joke around.

85
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,366
HomeIess?
Off to City of God!

86
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:00,662
There was no eIectricity, paved
streets or transportation.

87
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:04,274
But for the rich and powerfuI
our probIems didn't matter.

88
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,570
We were too far removed

89
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,680
from the picture postcard image
of Rio de Janeiro.

90
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:29,226
Do you think I can become
a Iifeguard one day?

91
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:30,794
I don't know.

92
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,706
Being a Iifeguard
is better than a fishmonger.

93
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,501
I don't want to seII fish .
It stinks.

94
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,105
-Are you insuIting your father?
-No.

95
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,948
So what do you want to be?

96
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,941
I don't know.

97
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,614
Not a hood or a poIiceman .

98
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:49,817
Why not?

99
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,853
I'm scared of getting shot.

100
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,519
Put that thing away, kid .

101
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,923
Are you nuts?
Pointing that gun at me?

102
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,226
Take it easy with the kid ,
Goose.

103
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,332
Li'I Dice is with me.

104
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,572
Right, I'm a gangster too.

105
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,266
That gas truck
didn't bring much .

106
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:14,068
So what?
We rob gas trucks every day.

107
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,937
One today,
another tomorrow.

108
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,446
No, we need to rob
some rich guy's house.

109
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,983
That's the onIy way
to get outta here.

110
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,588
HeII , no. What you need
is to foIIow my pIan .

111
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:25,589
That's it.

112
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,361
The IittIe fart's getting
too big for his britches!

113
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,761
He gets high
and starts taIking buIIshit.

114
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,668
You two junkies

115
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,773
aren't worth
haIf as much as that kid .

116
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,173
What you got in mind ,
Li'I Dice?

117
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,181
To be a reaI hood
you need more than just a gun.

118
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,876
You need ideas.

119
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,188
And Li'I Dice had them.

120
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,361
-Is that the moteI?
-Yeah .

121
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:07,828
We go in , grab the money and get
out. No kiIIing , got that?

122
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,262
I need this.

123
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:13,970
-Don't touch my gun , kid .
-Don't ever do that again .

124
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,137
-Don't point at me.
-Fuck you .

125
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,274
Don't point your finger at me!

126
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,342
Stop acting Iike a baby!

127
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,438
Here's yours.

128
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:24,238
-Awesome!
-Let's go!

129
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,941
-Not so fast!
-What?

130
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,450
You stay here and keep watch .

131
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:34,858
If the cops come,
shoot that window over there.

132
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,953
Why me?
Let that dork do that.

133
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:37,854
Look.

134
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,588
I gave you this great pIan ,
for free.

135
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,758
WhiIe that guy's
absoIuteIy useIess!

136
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,459
-You just had the idea.
-ExactIy!

137
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,764
You're just a kid , remember?

138
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,706
You cover us, okay?

139
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:56,979
You'II get your turn .
Stop trying to rush things.

140
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,082
You stay there.

141
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:06,850
This is a hoId-up, bitch .

142
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:13,523
You shouId be studying
or working .

143
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,726
You don't even Iook Iike
hoodIums.

144
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,633
Instead , you ought to be
working or studying , boy.

145
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,367
Shut up!
What a pain in the ass!

146
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,375
Okay, CIipper?

147
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,344
ShaII we go in?

148
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,580
I didn't order anything .

149
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,953
It's on the house, sir.
Hand over the money!

150
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,060
Keep caIm ,
aII I want is your cash .

151
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,061
-Don't point that. . .
-Your waIIet. . .

152
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,369
Hey, man .

153
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,206
What kind of whorehouse
is this?

154
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,342
-You from the church?
-Yes, brother.

155
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,556
Give it to me!

156
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,756
SIut!

157
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,520
You're fat and flabby!

158
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,128
Wanna take her pIace?

159
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,530
What's going on?

160
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,042
The cops! Let's beat it!

161
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,141
Let's go!

162
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,044
Take that car.
I'II go get Li'I Dice.

163
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,053
Jesus, what a car!

164
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,392
Something fucked up.
Li'I Dice is gone.

165
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,962
The cops are shooting ,
Iet's go!

166
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,425
SIow down ! HoId on .

167
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,121
You said you knew how to drive.

168
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,925
I do, so cooI it!

169
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,658
Turn ! Watch out!

170
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,774
You fucking asshoIe!

171
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,647
Hey, I didn't do it on purpose.

172
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,251
No one saw anything .

173
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,581
So keep your mouths shut,
understand?

174
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:58,958
HoId on , I twisted my ankIe.

175
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,896
Goose fucked up his ankIe.

176
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,891
It fucking hurts.

177
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,095
Take him into the woods.
I'II shoot to distract the cops.

178
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,603
-In God we trust.
-In God we trust.

179
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,214
Pass me the teIephone, Penguin .

180
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,713
Shorty is another notorious
guy in the City of God.

181
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,113
But it's not yet time
to teII the story.

182
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,016
It fucking hurts, Goose.

183
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,260
Shut up.

184
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:34,429
You sound Iike a damn sissy,
man .

185
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,065
CIimb up!

186
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,534
No one saw anything?

187
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,375
How odd !
A car crashes into a bar

188
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:46,544
and no one saw a thing .

189
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,038
I suppose
you didn't see anything either?

190
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,180
As usuaI ,

191
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,242
no one saw, no one knows.

192
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:58,948
So what's up, Shorty?

193
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,893
They're hiding in the woods.

194
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:04,218
HeIIo, MeIonhead .

195
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:09,524
I have this feeIing
that they're out in the woods.

196
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,030
The motherfuckers.

197
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,703
They're out in the woods.

198
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,406
FeIipe, Iock up the car.
RangeI , come with me.

199
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,914
I can't see a thing .
How the heII can they see?

200
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,113
Fucking jungIe.

201
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,722
They stoIe a fortune
at that moteI .

202
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,324
I know.

203
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,255
What if we took the money?

204
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,166
Are you craz?

205
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,659
I'm not getting mixed up
in that.

206
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,328
I want to exterminate
these guys.

207
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,838
What? Since when is steaIing

208
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,942
from niggers and thieves
a crime?

209
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,639
It won't be hard to nab them .

210
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,940
I have a stooIie in the City.

211
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,801
Did you hear those shots?

212
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,946
If I catch one of them ,
I'II kiII him .

213
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,219
Maracana!

214
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,225
Open the door.

215
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,035
What's the matter?

216
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,066
The cops are after me.

217
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,570
Shaggy!

218
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,510
The cops are on my ass!

219
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,116
Hide me!

220
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,787
Quick, come in .

221
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,585
Shit.

222
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,928
I thought the cops
wouId be down there aII night.

223
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,493
I had a vision , Goose.

224
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,930
You been smoking something?

225
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,733
-You've had a job, right?
-Yeah .

226
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,236
What's it Iike?
What do peopIe say?

227
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,512
I worked with my father.

228
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,810
And fathers taIk a Iot of shit.

229
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,047
You know what, Goose?

230
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,219
I'm getting out,
I don't want to die.

231
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,221
This gangster's Iife
isn't for me.

232
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,629
Wait!
The cops are stiII down there.

233
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,423
I don't give a shit.

234
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,730
I'm going back to the church .

235
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,805
I wiII say of the Lord ,

236
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:05,472
He is my refuge and my fortress,
in Him wiII I trust.

237
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:12,918
Fear not the terror by night,
nor the arrow that flies by day.

238
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,084
-Stop, motherfucker!
-Don't move!

239
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,818
Stop, or I'II shoot!

240
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,496
--shaII abide under the shadow
of the AImighty.

241
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:35,302
The hoId-up at the moteI
went down

242
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,808
as the bIoodiest in history.

243
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,144
The destinies of the outIaws
then took different paths.

244
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,906
I don't think this guy
was invoIved in the heist.

245
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,616
See here?

246
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,150
He's a worker, not a hoodIum .

247
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:50,820
I'II make him one now.

248
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,854
Destiny put CIipper
back into the hands of God.

249
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:05,159
Shaggy was in Bernice's hands.

250
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,438
And Goose
was in my father's hands.

251
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:14,041
Why do you do these things?
You think I'm a fooI?

252
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,578
From now on ,
you'II work with me.

253
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:20,446
Your younger brother
wiII keep an eye on you .

254
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,576
You Iisten to me.

255
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,780
If I catch you with money
that isn't yours,

256
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,453
I'II kiII you .

257
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:29,757
That goes for you too.

258
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,353
Get changed !
You start work immediateIy.

259
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,867
Having a hood
as a brother sucks.

260
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,967
You aIways end up
footing the biII.

261
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:41,661
Don't worry.

262
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,272
Dad's mad at me,

263
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,477
but he'II get over it.

264
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:55,410
Give me that, Rocket.
It's not for you .

265
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:56,676
You have to study.

266
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,278
Getting shot
doesn't scare you?

267
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,889
I'm a hood
because I got no brain .

268
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,721
But you're smart.
You shouId study.

269
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:07,521
I go to schooI because
I don't Iike physicaI work.

270
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,625
Promise me something .

271
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,962
That you'II never touch
this gun . Promise?

272
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,837
Let's shake.

273
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,443
We'd better hurry.

274
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:24,247
I'm gonna seII a Iot of fish .
And don't Iaugh .

275
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,850
You grinned when I got sIapped .

276
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,642
-Who, me?
-I saw you .

277
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,213
What is it, Shaggy?
Cat got your tongue?

278
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,114
Your fidgeting behind me
makes me nervous.

279
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,222
I'm thinking
of what to say to you .

280
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,253
You're thinking , as weII?

281
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,821
Don't.
It'II be your downfaII .

282
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,930
My heart has chosen you .
And I foIIow my heart.

283
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,032
Are you puIIing my Ieg?

284
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,635
You never heard of
Iove at first sight?

285
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,031
Hoods don't Iove, they desire.

286
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,971
You cut down everything I say.

287
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,045
Hoods don't taIk,
they smooth-taIk.

288
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:33,343
WeII , I'II stop
wasting my breath on you .

289
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,447
Hoods don't stop,
they take a break.

290
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,655
TaIking to you about Iove
sure is compIicated .

291
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:44,360
It's not Iove,
it's a con game.

292
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,203
It's just that I Iove you .

293
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,516
You just might end up
convincing me.

294
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:33,040
After the hoId-up, there were
constant poIice raids

295
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:34,634
in the sIum.

296
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,447
Every day,
someone went to jaiI,

297
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,155
someone was naiIed.

298
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,157
But no one had seen anything.

299
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,452
No one knew anything.

300
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,664
No one bIabbed to the cops

301
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,360
about where the thieves
were hiding out.

302
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:04,697
Shaggy.

303
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,410
Why don't you change your Iife?

304
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:12,214
Get a job instead of
Iying around in bed aII day.

305
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:15,151
-Good-for-nothing !
-What do you mean?

306
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:18,119
You think you can make money
working? Go ahead .

307
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,025
That's right, Shaggy.

308
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,224
What do you think I do aII day?

309
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,027
Take it easy, baby.

310
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,330
You know aII I want

311
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:35,030
is to be with you
have kids, and a farm ,

312
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,638
raise chickens,
grow pot and get high .

313
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:41,244
Sure! For me,
that's nothing but smooth-taIk.

314
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:54,388
What? I aImost got rich
with that moteI job.

315
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,250
Are you kidding?

316
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,596
The cops
are stiII Iooking for you

317
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,527
because of the deaths
in the moteI .

318
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,096
What deaths?
What are you taIking about?

319
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,739
Did you see anything?
You don't know shit, so shut up.

320
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:13,206
You weren't there.
I didn't kiII anyone.

321
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:15,641
I bet it's those fucking
poIicemen ,

322
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:16,905
and I'm the one taking the rap.

323
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,149
They even nabbed Li'I Dice.

324
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,016
So don't bring it up again !

325
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,218
-I don't care who did it.
-It wasn't me.

326
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,513
Let me just say.

327
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,416
I don't want my kid's father
to be a hoodIum .

328
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,126
You're aII aIone, Shaggy.

329
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,660
-AII aIone?
-That's right!

330
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,432
-CIipper's gone reIigious.
-HaIIeIujah !

331
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,033
-Goose is working .
-Ass-kisser!

332
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,328
-And you?
-I haven't changed .

333
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:42,571
So what?
They've deserted me, that's aII .

334
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,443
Then i'm deserting you too.

335
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:50,237
I'm spIitting , Shaggy.
Come with me, if you want.

336
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,341
Otherwise, I'II go aIone.

337
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:09,098
Fish for saIe!

338
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:12,692
My brother had promised
to stop messing around.

339
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,001
But a hood doesn't stop,

340
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,740
a hood takes a break.

341
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:23,137
Goose began messing around
with Shorty's wife.

342
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:26,112
I have trout. But for
speciaI customers Iike you ,

343
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,349
I aIso have a kisser fish .

344
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,054
Hey, that's a muIIet!

345
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,126
Doesn't your husband

346
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,919
go down on you?

347
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,125
No.

348
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,629
Mine, before entering me,
has to use his tongue.

349
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:48,637
For about haIf an hour.

350
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,834
And from behind?
Do you Iet him?

351
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,575
Good God , no.
Doesn't it hurt?

352
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,241
The first few times.

353
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,446
Then you'II see,
it's fantastic.

354
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:00,775
But you need a banana.

355
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:02,919
What for?

356
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,280
You're missing
the good things in Iife, girI !

357
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:09,685
You take a banana,
warm it up. . .

358
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,725
Put it up your thing ,
whiIe he takes you from behind .

359
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:14,795
It's a reaI rush !

360
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,891
Ask your husband .

361
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,896
I couIdn't. You don't know him .

362
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,704
He's IiabIe to beat me.

363
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:26,536
Try him . Men go wiId
for smut Iike that.

364
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:35,914
Motherfucking nigger!

365
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,547
SIut!

366
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,726
Whoring bitch !

367
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:49,930
Rocket, give me your shorts.
Quick!

368
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:51,659
Take them off, dammit!

369
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,239
I'm not going naked
in the street.

370
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,033
You want your brother to die?

371
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,040
Give me your shorts. Now!

372
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:01,476
Give me your shirt.

373
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:06,682
Your shorts! Hurry up!

374
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:13,790
I knew it. It's aIways me
who forks up for that bum .

375
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,491
The bastard ran off.
That's his brother.

376
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,334
-That brat there?
-I'II castrate that fucker.

377
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:34,545
Fish ! Fish for saIe!

378
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,810
Hey, kid , come over here.

379
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:42,113
-Where's your brother?
-He's not working today.

380
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,145
-Oh yeah? Get in .
-I didn't do anything .

381
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:46,822
-Get in !
-What about my fish?

382
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:48,824
Hurry it up, kid !

383
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,822
I don't want to Iose my fish !

384
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:51,528
Forget your fish .

385
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,823
Give me that.

386
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,226
My father wiII kiII me.

387
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:58,763
That doesn't matter.

388
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,109
Let's go. There's nothing here.

389
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,117
That day, my father swore

390
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,681
he never wanted to see
my brother again.

391
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:18,683
Let's go, FeIipe.

392
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:22,817
And he never did.

393
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:25,086
No one ever
saw him in the sIum again.

394
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:28,489
The story of the Tender Trio
was coming to an end.

395
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:31,793
Li'I Dice?

396
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:35,504
Shit, man . I thought
you were a goner at the moteI .

397
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,499
You're fucking Ioaded !

398
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,510
Don't, Benny.
That's our money.

399
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,714
Fuck you . Cut the crap
and give me the money.

400
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,310
Benny.

401
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,251
TeII your brother Shaggy
that Shorty is squeaIing .

402
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,148
I'm Ieaving the sIum .

403
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,025
But Shorty had his hands fuII.

404
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,139
Let's go see, Stringy.

405
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,154
A neighbor caIIed the poIice
before sunrise.

406
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:29,253
The tabIoids went to town:

407
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,755
''Man Buries Wife AIive
in the City of God''

408
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,956
AIong with reporters, the pIace
was swarming with cops.

409
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:39,598
The hoodIums took off.

410
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,607
-You wanna die?
-It's you who's gonna die

411
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,072
if you don't do what I say.

412
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:46,670
And show the Iady more respect.

413
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,672
Let's go, dammit!

414
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,079
-There are cops ahead .
-Fuck them , Iet's go.

415
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:58,778
-Where to?
-Anywhere, just go.

416
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,317
What's the matter?

417
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:05,527
Have mercy!
This car is a piece of junk.

418
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:09,224
-My ass! Start the damn thing !
-It needs a push .

419
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:12,627
Push , Shaggy!

420
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:14,629
Push !

421
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,844
You?

422
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,949
You want to arrest the thieves?
Over there.

423
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,656
Nab that guy over there!

424
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:05,313
Run , Shaggy!

425
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,616
Stop the car!

426
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,669
This way! He's over here.

427
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,239
We got that sonofabitch !

428
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:05,709
-The bastard !
-He's a murderer.

429
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:18,926
On the day Shaggy died
I remember the crowds

430
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,121
and a camera.

431
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,528
I'd aIways wanted to have one.

432
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,829
Let's go to schooI .

433
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:42,585
-WeII?
-Let's go to the beach .

434
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,046
But we have an exam .

435
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:49,752
So what?
Everyone eIse is at the beach .

436
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:52,959
Come on , Iet's go!

437
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,860
She's in a bikini ,
but doesn't want to go.

438
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,760
What's that saying you have?

439
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,501
The sun is for everyone. The
beach , for those who deserve it.

440
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,748
I bought my first camera
when I was 1 6.

441
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,511
Like aII poor peopIe,
I started at the bottom

442
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,754
with the worId's cheapest
modeI.

443
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:22,824
So, Rocket?
How are things going?

444
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:24,859
Any Iuck getting Iaid yet?

445
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,724
ZiIch .

446
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,532
AngeIica.
I was craz about her.

447
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,637
So, Rocket,
stiII cIicking away?

448
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,171
She was gorgeous and the onIy
girI in our gang who screwed.

449
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,177
I wanted to Iose
my virginity with her.

450
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,379
With her, buddy?

451
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:44,637
She's got a guy.

452
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,348
So? I'm not jeaIous.

453
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,778
Her father's a sergeant.

454
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:49,751
No one's perfect.

455
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,453
CIoser together!

456
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,654
I was the officiaI
photographer of our gang.

457
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,150
The gang of groovies.

458
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,588
Everyone paid

459
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,490
to have copies of the pictures.

460
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:08,994
Tiago,

461
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,097
move back a IittIe.

462
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:12,305
Is this okay?

463
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,542
Perfect.

464
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,386
I need a joint.

465
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,017
Instead of smoking , man ,

466
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:29,054
you shouId snort coke.
It's far out.

467
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,720
You snort, Tiago?
I prefer a good toke.

468
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,525
If you Iike,
I can get it for you .

469
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,361
You can?
Then go on , move your ass!

470
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:43,236
But the choice stuff is coke.

471
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:47,437
That's a reaI nercotic.

472
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,442
Narcotic!

473
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,443
Your mouth is aII saIty, Tiago.

474
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,347
Screw you .

475
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:59,352
You want to be
a Iifeguard , Stringy?

476
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,717
-You're never in the water.
-My dad's a Iifeguard .

477
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,824
I'II bet you a beer
I swim better.

478
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,523
You're on .

479
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,092
If you Iike,

480
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:12,326
I can go get you a joint
at BIacky's.

481
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:29,047
I'd have done anything
to pIease her.

482
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:31,715
Buy her pot, coke.

483
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:39,022
I couId go to the top dogs

484
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,621
to buy quaIity stuff
at a good price

485
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:45,426
because the IocaI boss

486
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:50,236
was a former cIassmate: BIacky.

487
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,439
Who is it?

488
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:53,940
Rocket.

489
00:36:56,647 --> 00:37:00,174
-How are things down there?
-Fine.

490
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,718
-And the kids?
-Fine too.

491
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,217
You want to buy
or smoke a joint?

492
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:05,887
-Buy.
-Come in , buddy.

493
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:12,117
Who is it?

494
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:21,801
This was BIacky's turf.

495
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,900
But it hadn't aIways been his.

496
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,010
-Hey, BIacky.
-Fuck, Li'I Dice.

497
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,141
You show up Iike this
at my pIace?

498
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:35,212
Who said it was your pIace?

499
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,316
Dona ZeIia began
seIIing drugs here

500
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:42,950
in order to raise
her daughters.

501
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:46,628
She aIso gave away drugs
to boys at times

502
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,426
in return for speciaI favors.

503
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:51,932
Her favorite was ''Big Boy''.

504
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:55,569
One day, he grew very big!

505
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,206
ZeIia's operation
was so amateur

506
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,711
that he had no troubIe
seizing it from her.

507
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:09,182
Big Boy used the neighborhood
kids as deaIers.

508
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,215
What about my pot?

509
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:14,083
Stick it up your ass.

510
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,691
The best deaIer

511
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,485
was Carrot.

512
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,930
He earned Big Boy's trust,

513
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:30,005
and moved up
to become a manager.

514
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:35,405
BIacky, 20 for us
and 5 for you , okay?

515
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:38,140
One day a buddy of Carrot's
showed up.

516
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,416
His name was AristotIe.

517
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:44,818
My wife needs
an operation .

518
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:46,956
His famiIy had taken Carrot in

519
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,524
when he was down and out.

520
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:54,557
He couIdn't refuse
to heIp a brother in need.

521
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:59,030
Here's the dope. I want
the dough no Iater than Friday.

522
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,862
-You've baiIed me out, brother.
-Friday.

523
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:08,305
He's my buddy,
practicaIIy my brother, Big Boy.

524
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:12,811
Give him another week.

525
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,679
Either you kiII him ,
or I'II kiII you .

526
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:16,978
Carrot had no choice.

527
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,712
I said Friday.

528
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:22,522
Don't do it, man .

529
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,488
Carrot wanted to kiII Big Boy,

530
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,823
but it wasn't necessary.

531
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,896
Big Boy hadn't paid off
the cops. He died in jaiI.

532
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:38,833
Carrot took everything
that beIonged to Big Boy,

533
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,101
but didn't want the apartment.

534
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,040
The pIace was iII-fated.

535
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,307
Carrot gave it to his most
trusted deaIer, BIacky.

536
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:47,506
Here. 1 50 bags.

537
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,413
Give me more.

538
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,116
That's how he took over
the IocaI trade.

539
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:57,653
But not for Iong.

540
00:39:58,262 --> 00:39:59,729
Who is it?

541
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,726
Go see.

542
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,239
-Hey, BIacky.
-Fuck, Li'I Dice.

543
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,343
You show up Iike this
at my pIace?

544
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,447
Who said it was your pIace?

545
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:21,447
Yeah , who?

546
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,586
Something wrong , Li'I Dice?

547
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:32,957
Li'I Dice, my ass.
My name is Li'I Z e now.

548
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:39,065
Li'I Ze had aIways wanted
to be boss of the City of God,

549
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,000
ever since he was caIIed
''Li'I Dice''.

550
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,307
They're having fun , and not me?

551
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:53,707
I want to get out of here.

552
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,527
What, kid?
Your friend took everything .

553
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:06,855
What do you want?

554
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:16,864
That night, Li'I Dice
satisfied his thirst to kiII,

555
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,575
though he knew
Shaggy wouId never forgive him.

556
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:31,647
To avoid being punished
he Ieft the City of God.

557
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,747
He had to work hard
for peanuts.

558
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,062
Yeah , Benny!

559
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,458
Li'I Dice and Benny
managed weII.

560
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,464
They had the gift of crime.

561
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,662
-You have more money than me.
-It was my idea.

562
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,666
The onIy probIem was running
into an oIder hoodIum

563
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,376
Iike my brother, Goose.

564
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,805
Li'I Dice?

565
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:00,348
Shit, man . I thought
you were a goner at the moteI .

566
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,349
You're fucking Ioaded !

567
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,220
Don't, Benny.
That's our money.

568
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:10,658
Benny, teII your brother Shaggy

569
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,857
that Shorty is squeaIing .

570
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:16,862
I'm Ieaving the sIum .

571
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:20,929
Goose!

572
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:27,240
From Shaggy. You'II need it.

573
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:49,758
From one hit to the next,
Li'I Dice grew up.

574
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,162
At 1 8, he was the most
respected hood

575
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,400
in the City of God.

576
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:56,663
You're of age now, watch out!

577
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,672
He was one of the most
wanted robbers in Rio.

578
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:15,057
Li'I Dice, how's it going?

579
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,854
Happy birthday.
I'm so gIad you've turned 1 8.

580
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:20,155
Get Iost, Tuba!

581
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:21,558
Excuse me, amigo.

582
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:24,857
Give me a beer!

583
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,560
Didn't you see me, prick?

584
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:28,770
-Sorry, man .
-Up yours!

585
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,838
The next time,
I'II waste you , asshoIe!

586
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,171
Fag !

587
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:41,140
Li'I Dice was ready
for anything.

588
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:42,444
I wanna taIk.

589
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:45,145
And he was itching to start.

590
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:46,846
Who are
the fattest cats here?

591
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:48,354
There are tons of them .

592
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:50,253
Look at Jerry Adriani

593
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:55,455
goId chain , snazz cIothes.

594
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,661
Look at Pereira
and the chick he's with

595
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,232
Bernice.
She was my brother's girI .

596
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,094
Check out his car.

597
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,502
Then there's BIacky.
Covered in goId .

598
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,736
GoId chain , goId watch .

599
00:44:08,212 --> 00:44:12,308
Look at Carrot, and his car.

600
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,813
They're aII deaIers.

601
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,509
They're aII fucking Ioaded .

602
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,318
HoId-ups bring in chickenshit.

603
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,748
-The big bucks are in drugs.
-I see.

604
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,120
EspeciaIIy in seIIing coke.

605
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,819
-But you need money.
-Not reaIIy.

606
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,532
We'II kiII these cIowns
and take over their business.

607
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:33,729
-When do we start?
-Now.

608
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,848
Exu-the-DeviI
is the Iight that shines forth .

609
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,785
He brought you here.

610
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:54,953
Why remain in the City of God
where God has forgotten you?

611
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,394
I know what you want.

612
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:00,293
You want power.

613
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:04,293
I have something
which wiII give it to you .

614
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:10,496
To change your fate,
I give you my protector, boy.

615
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:14,407
But you mustn't fornicate
with the amuIet

616
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:16,204
otherwise,

617
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,707
you'II die.

618
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:20,312
The boy is no Ionger caIIed
Li'I Dice

619
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,918
but Li'I Z e.

620
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:28,419
Li'I Z e wiII grow up.

621
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:34,521
You'II stick with me,
I'II stick with you .

622
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:46,632
Li'I Dice became Li'I Ze

623
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,243
and he began to kiII.

624
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:51,045
He started one morning,

625
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,782
taking over Jerry Adriani's
racket.

626
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:54,951
By that night,

627
00:45:55,152 --> 00:46:00,988
aImost aII of the rackets
in the sIum were his.

628
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:05,527
The onIy business he didn't
touch was Carrot's

629
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:07,127
since he was a friend
of Benny's.

630
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,489
AII that was Ieft
was the apartment

631
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,828
But that wouId be easy.

632
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,834
Who is it?

633
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:27,512
-Hey, BIacky.
-Fuck, Li'I Dice.

634
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:29,246
You show up Iike this
at my pIace?

635
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:32,019
Who said it was your pIace?

636
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,517
Something wrong , Li'I Dice?

637
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:37,225
Li'I Dice, my ass.
My name is Li'I Z e now.

638
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,158
Li'I Z e, see?

639
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:42,423
-You're a goner, bastard .
-Don't kiII him . He understands.

640
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:43,565
Right, BIacky?

641
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:47,333
It's aII yours.

642
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:49,533
I don't want no troubIe, okay?

643
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,435
I shouId have taken this chance
to avenge my brother's death.

644
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:58,142
You'II Iive,
but you'II work for us.

645
00:46:58,348 --> 00:46:59,440
Understand?

646
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:00,976
That's easy to say.

647
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:05,086
-Where are you going?
-He's cIean , Li'I Z e.

648
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:08,087
What's your name, kid?

649
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:11,120
-Rocket.
-He's Goose's brother.

650
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,487
-Goose?
-The Iate Goose.

651
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,491
Quick, kid . Run aIong .

652
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:21,830
TeII everyone that this
business

653
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:25,302
now beIongs to Li'I Z e.
And that we'II be seIIing coke.

654
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,498
Got that?

655
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:28,935
Cocaine.

656
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:35,541
-Where's the turf?
-Over there, on the Ieft.

657
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:38,619
SeIIing drugs is
Iike any other business.

658
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,647
The suppIier
deIivers the merchandise

659
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:45,861
which is then packaged
on the premises.

660
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,023
It's done in an assembIy Iine.

661
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:50,427
Boring as heII.

662
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,527
Pot is wrapped up in ''Iids''.

663
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:58,439
Cocaine is put into packets,

664
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:02,173
and then into bundIes
of 1 0 or 1 00.

665
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,605
You can even make a career
in deaIing drugs.

666
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:09,281
The kids start out
as deIivery boys.

667
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,788
They're paid to run errands

668
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,787
and take messages.

669
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,683
Then they become Iookouts.

670
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,121
If the poIice arrive,

671
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:20,922
the kites disappear
and everyone scrams.

672
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:24,694
Later, you become a deaIer

673
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:25,994
or a ''vapor''.

674
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:27,497
When the heat's on,

675
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:29,503
the ''vapor''
quickIy evaporates.

676
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:33,305
Moving up the Iadder,
you have the ''soIdier''.

677
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,005
And if the guy is good at math,

678
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,508
he can become a manager,

679
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:40,308
the boss's right-hand man.

680
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,745
The poIice receive their part
and don't make troubIe.

681
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:51,216
Since Li'I Ze kiIIed off
aII of his enemies,

682
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:54,554
there were no shoot-outs
in the City of God.

683
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:56,321
You couId drive there.

684
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,732
The pIayboys feIt safe
buying their drugs there.

685
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:03,801
The City teemed with addicts

686
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:06,105
and Li'I Ze grew rich.

687
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,983
I can't decide which to wear.

688
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,516
This one's cooI .

689
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:19,485
If deaIing were IegaI,

690
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,716
Li'I Ze wouId have been
man of the year.

691
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,822
But things were risky for me.
I was afraid of him.

692
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,090
And he was everywhere.

693
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,030
What a drag this guy is.

694
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:35,134
Whenever I wanted
to smoke a joint

695
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:38,140
I had to go see Carrot.

696
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,113
HaIf a Iid .

697
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:46,015
Thanks.

698
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,551
But it was worth it.
I onIy smoked with AngeIica.

699
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:55,115
She and Tiago had spIit up,

700
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,316
so I made my move.

701
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:58,653
I was about to win her over.

702
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:01,854
These pictures are reaIIy
great.

703
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:03,123
You think so?

704
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:04,964
I Iook good here.

705
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:08,366
-You Iook beautifuI everywhere.
-I'm serious.

706
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:09,730
Me too.

707
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:15,438
A setting sun,
a deserted beach

708
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,438
a Iong kiss.

709
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,248
I was sure this was it.

710
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,752
But the Runts arrived.

711
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:27,752
Can I have a toke?

712
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:34,459
Here.

713
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:37,792
I'm going . See you Iater.

714
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,905
HoId on , AngeIica.

715
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:46,704
-Your joint, man .
-Keep it.

716
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,775
What a cooI guy.

717
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:56,916
That was my first run-in
with the Runts.

718
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,425
Steak and fries, Benny.

719
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:06,424
Great!

720
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:11,058
Here.

721
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:12,959
A tip for you .

722
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:15,529
ReaIIy? Thanks.

723
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,238
-Wanna eat something?
-No.

724
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:22,777
Wanna trade this watch?

725
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:24,742
After AngeIica Ieft him,

726
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,243
Tiago began snorting
more and more.

727
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:28,842
Is it your grandfather's?

728
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:30,949
No, my dad's.

729
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,846
When a guy is reaIIy hooked

730
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:35,181
he ends up in the hands
of the deaIer.

731
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,454
-Two bags of ten .
-One of ten .

732
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:38,658
Okay, one bag .

733
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,456
For Tiago, it was different.

734
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:43,464
Watch out!

735
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,461
Sorry, godfather.

736
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,467
Godfather, my ass.
Did I baptize your kids?

737
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:49,070
I'm sorry.

738
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,967
Now beat it.

739
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,905
BIacky, Iend me your bike.

740
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,367
Hey, wanna race?

741
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,437
Where to?

742
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,642
Up to the highway.

743
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:31,781
-Okay.
-Ready? Go!

744
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,160
Pretty tough , wasn't it?

745
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,196
Yeah , you're good .

746
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:00,300
Where'd you buy those sneakers?

747
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:03,101
-Not far from here.
-The shirt, as weII?

748
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:05,747
-No, uptown .
-CooI .

749
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,143
It's a designer shirt.

750
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,318
If I give you money
can you buy me one?

751
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:12,417
Shorts and a shirt?

752
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:17,124
Buy whatever you can .

753
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,925
-What size are you?
-Measure me.

754
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:26,068
-With what, man?
-Shit, with your hand .

755
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,362
Shoe size?

756
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,333
Turn around .

757
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,038
Hey, Benny!

758
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:42,043
You got the digs?

759
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:49,754
-Just one pair of pants?
-No, there's more.

760
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:57,395
-You Iike it?
-Yeah .

761
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:58,992
There's some change.

762
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:02,137
Keep it.

763
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:04,500
CooI .

764
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,707
This is Benny.

765
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:19,518
-This is Rocket.
-Hi . I know him .

766
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,039
I've become a pIayboy.

767
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:52,244
Hey, gangsters, Iisten to this.

768
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:54,251
Watch out.

769
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,859
Groovies shake their asses
before Iaying a big one.

770
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:03,495
Oh yeah?

771
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:11,229
Fuck off, you bastards!

772
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:13,202
Making fun of me?

773
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:16,337
AsshoIe!

774
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:34,225
Benny, didn't I teII you
to shoot Carrot?

775
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:35,921
He's endangering the sIum .

776
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:39,529
-CooI it. Go taIk to him .
-I'm gonna kiII that fucker.

777
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:41,669
Stop trying to wipe out
everyone.

778
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:42,632
I'm gonna kiII him .

779
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,776
Don't worry, AngeIica.
The guys in here are cooI .

780
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:50,639
Sure, I'm not worried .

781
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:54,845
You gonna dance, Benny?
What about Carrot?

782
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:58,643
Go taIk to the guy.

783
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:02,719
Benny was the cooIest hood
in the City of God.

784
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:06,094
He gave away pot,
paid for drinks.

785
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,322
Li'I Ze was the opposite.
He had one obsession:

786
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,295
to be the boss of the sIum.

787
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:15,934
He wanted an excuse
to take over Carrot's racket.

788
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:17,797
-Hey, Carrot.
-What's up?

789
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:21,533
You shouIdn't Iet the Runts
do hoId-ups in the sIum .

790
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:25,508
You Iook after your section ,
I'II Iook after mine.

791
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:29,817
Got that?
I'm gonna get a drink.

792
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,825
-Hey, Rocket! How's it going?
-Great.

793
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:45,533
-Hey, Benny!
-How's it going?

794
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:49,160
-Hey, Tiago. How are you?
-Good .

795
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,037
-May I?
-Sure.

796
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:54,276
Wanna dance?

797
00:56:58,148 --> 00:56:59,843
Is it okay at your pIace?

798
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:01,115
No probIem .

799
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:04,514
My parents are out.
You'II be aII aIone with her.

800
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:07,689
You can Iose
your virginity tonight.

801
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:09,518
Not so Ioud , man !

802
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:11,990
Everyone wiII hear.

803
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:15,697
-You're beautifuI .
-Thank you .

804
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:16,991
Shit!

805
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,525
Nothing's happening .

806
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:29,643
Look, man , I know the Runts
are associated with you .

807
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:31,814
Think I'm a sucker,
you IittIe brat?

808
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:35,412
-You want to take my racket?
-I want to taIk to you

809
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:37,853
because you're fucking useIess.

810
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:39,722
Get your hand away!

811
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:41,717
The Runts are screwing up
our security, man .

812
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,525
Give the baby his bottIe.

813
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:48,360
Carrot, just ask the kids
to cooI it, okay?

814
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:49,732
Carrot's useIess.

815
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,924
He Iets the Runts do hoId-ups
in his section .

816
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,762
The poIice come around

817
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:55,727
and that's bad for business.

818
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,840
I'II do it
onIy because I Iike you .

819
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:02,309
But you need to change
that baby's diapers.

820
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,312
I'II show you
who's the baby.

821
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:10,475
TeII the kids that in my sIum
no one robs or rapes!

822
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,588
No wonder you're ''LittIe'' Z e!

823
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:19,691
The Runts were kids
who didn't respect the Iaws

824
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:20,885
of the sIum.

825
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:23,190
They wouId mug residents,
hoId up bakeries,

826
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,494
especiaIIy in Carrot's section.

827
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:27,728
What are you doing?

828
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,706
You rob me aII the time!

829
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:38,107
But they didn't know

830
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:42,212
that the City had a boss now.

831
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,747
THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING US

832
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:48,749
The City had became much safer

833
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:50,255
for residents.

834
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:53,653
There were hardIy
any hoId-ups now.

835
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:55,922
You just had to go see Li'I Ze.

836
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,831
-Let's go.
-Don't hurt the Runts.

837
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,262
I won't touch them .

838
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:08,477
-Hi , Steak.
-How's it going , LiI Ze?

839
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:10,771
-Wanna take a waIk, Steak?
-With you? HoId on .

840
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:15,080
Mom , I'm going out
with my friends.

841
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:30,689
That's the best chicken
I ever ate.

842
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:33,730
The oId guy was scared
shitIess.

843
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:35,732
FeeIing sorry for him?

844
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:37,731
You're craz, man !

845
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:39,406
Why not stick up
a bank or a supermarket?

846
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:50,312
Peanuts.
Drugs are where it's at.

847
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,852
Yeah , seIIing drugs.

848
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:55,156
But you have to start out
as a deIivery boy.

849
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:56,620
You wanna be a deIivery boy?

850
00:59:56,826 --> 00:59:58,123
It's a rip-off.
It takes a Iong time

851
00:59:58,528 --> 00:59:59,517
to move up.

852
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:01,629
You have to wait tiII an oIder
guy gets kiIIed to move up.

853
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:04,059
I don't wanna wait tiII
some guy croaks.

854
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:11,438
I'm gonna do what Li'I Z e did .

855
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:16,238
I'm gonna wipe them aII out.

856
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:20,941
TaIking about me, kid?
The boss is here.

857
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:27,855
Come back, you brat!

858
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:34,262
They're quick, those kids.

859
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:36,597
They run fast.

860
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,460
They're aII gone except you .

861
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,065
Any others?

862
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,704
You're gonna pay
for the ones that escaped .

863
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:55,010
You choose. ShaII I shoot you
in the hand or foot?

864
01:00:55,685 --> 01:00:57,016
Come on , choose!

865
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,017
Hand or foot?

866
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:00,120
Choose, for fuck's sake!

867
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,655
-Hand .
-The IittIe hand , eh?

868
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:04,224
CooI .

869
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,358
Hey, Steak'n'fries,
Iet's see what you're made of.

870
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:13,424
Choose and then kiII
one of them .

871
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,863
Leave it. I'II do it.

872
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,647
Butt out, Tuba.
This is for him .

873
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:31,745
Go on , Steak.

874
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:34,252
Go on , choose one and shoot.

875
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:38,050
Come on , I haven't got aII day.

876
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:46,157
KiII one of them .

877
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,968
I wanna see
what you're made of.

878
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,528
WeII done!

879
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:18,760
You did it.

880
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:21,034
You're one of us.

881
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:23,434
Very good , Steak.

882
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:31,280
Get up, brat.
Go back to your rat hoIe.

883
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,242
Without Iimping !

884
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:37,849
TeII your buddies that no one
robs in LiI Ze's sIum .

885
01:02:38,154 --> 01:02:39,644
Go now. And no Iimping , okay?

886
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,383
CooI , LiI Ze.

887
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:02,811
WhiIe Li'I Ze was winning
the respect of the residents.

888
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:06,741
Benny was winning
AngeIica's heart.

889
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:11,916
As for me, I was stiII
a virgin, singIe and broke.

890
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:13,819
I had no choice.

891
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:20,556
I had to take a job

892
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:22,731
in a supermarket.

893
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,660
I worked Iong hours
for chickenfeed.

894
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:26,762
I wanted to be Iaid off

895
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:31,531
so I couId buy a camera
with the severance pay.

896
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:35,136
But things
didn't work out that way.

897
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:41,644
-It's the guy on the beach .
-Hey, bro!

898
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:44,248
-StiII smoking good stuff?
-Yeah .

899
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:46,949
That guy's too cooI .

900
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:49,451
Hey, kid . Come here.
Lift up your shirt.

901
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:57,462
We give these sIum kids a chance
and they don't appreciate it.

902
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:00,795
-What about my severance pay?
-What severance pay?

903
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:04,732
That fucking manager thought
I was part of the gang.

904
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:07,700
You're fired for
serious misconduct.

905
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:10,310
Get out. ImmediateIy!

906
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:13,011
I didn't get a singIe cent.

907
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:30,529
It was Iike a message from God:

908
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:35,836
''Honesty doesn't pay, sucker. ''

909
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:51,252
The bus sure took
a Iong time to come.

910
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:52,944
I shouId aIready be at work.

911
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:56,857
Shit, hide that gun .
Are you nuts?

912
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,592
It was Goose's.
It's broken anyway.

913
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:02,287
The company
runs few buses on this Iine.

914
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:03,897
It's never anyone's fauIt.

915
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:06,295
It's aIways someone eIse.

916
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:08,934
It's my grandfather's fauIt.

917
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:10,932
And then ,
they make us squeeze!

918
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:12,606
Have a nice evening , ma'am .

919
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:17,110
I know that guy.

920
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:20,914
He Iives in the City.
He'II recognize us.

921
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:23,347
So? He couIdn't care Iess
if we take his boss' money.

922
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:25,548
Okay. Let's go.

923
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:32,018
WeII , boys?
Aren't you from the City of God?

924
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:33,927
Yeah .

925
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:37,822
I'II Iet one of you through
without paying .

926
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:43,232
You shouId study

927
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:46,973
so you can get out of the sIum .

928
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:48,939
It's too fuII
of cops and hoodIums.

929
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:49,975
Did you study?

930
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:53,041
I was in schooI
and in the army.

931
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:55,774
I was the best marksman
in my barracks.

932
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:59,380
This job was aII
I couId find afterwards.

933
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,483
But I do karate.
If I'm hired somewhere,

934
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:05,887
I'II Ieave the sIum .

935
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:07,687
Do you fight, then?

936
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:10,727
I'm for peace and Iove.

937
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:12,298
But if I have to.

938
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:14,795
He didn't know
he wouId have to.

939
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:18,734
But not yet, it's not time
to teII Knockout Ned's story.

940
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,133
-We shouId be going .
-Let's go.

941
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:23,705
-Goodbye.
-Thanks.

942
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:24,743
See you .

943
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:33,117
I couIdn't do it.
He was such a cooI guy.

944
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,813
Yeah , totaIIy.
That's Gerson's brother.

945
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:38,618
Let's go home.

946
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:45,932
There's nothing here
except that bakery over there.

947
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:47,659
What wiII you say?

948
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:50,531
I don't know.
''This is a hoId-up''.

949
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:54,574
Here's my number.

950
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,176
-You Iike souI or groovy?
-SouI .

951
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,241
That one didn't work either.

952
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:01,277
The counter girI
was just too fo xy.

953
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:02,610
And she flirted with me.

954
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:04,183
WiII you caII me?

955
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:08,924
I couIdn't puII a gun on her,
she was such a cooI girI .

956
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:10,285
Yeah , I agree.

957
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:14,527
Excuse me.

958
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,598
I'm Iost.
How do I get to Barra?

959
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:21,928
-To Barra?
-Yes.

960
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:24,735
I thought: ''Tough Iuck
for this guy from Sao PauIo. ''

961
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:26,299
In fact, we were going there.

962
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:28,101
You're kidding .

963
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:32,640
-You're a Iifesaver.
-That's right.

964
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:36,509
Because no guy from Sao PauIo
couId ever be cooI.

965
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,425
The body's over here.

966
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:48,560
We found it, Chief.

967
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:51,426
The forensic expert!

968
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:09,883
-Not a pretty sight, eh?
-You said it.

969
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,077
-What a great singer.
-You Iike him?

970
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:13,819
I Iove music. What about you?

971
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:15,722
TeII me, do you aIso Iike pot?

972
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:21,829
I can't say
I've never tried it.

973
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:26,024
The deviI recognizes his own .

974
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:29,737
Do you have papers?

975
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,134
I think so.

976
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:34,305
I have some.

977
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:37,938
I'd aIways been an ace
at roIIing a joint.

978
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:40,308
If I'd had the same skiII
with girIs,

979
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:44,748
I'd never have Iost so many
chances to Iose my virginity.

980
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:50,749
For a Sao PauIo guy
you're reaIIy cooI .

981
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,655
Thanks, bro.

982
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:55,023
What did they use?

983
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:57,831
A cIub or a rock.

984
01:08:58,334 --> 01:08:59,961
And the chiId?

985
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:02,763
-Untouched .
-Thank goodness.

986
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:04,903
How Iong ago?

987
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,034
About four hours.

988
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:10,706
-Can we take it away?
-Go ahead .

989
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:13,277
The murderer

990
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:16,679
has to be from the City of God .

991
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:36,835
You bastard ! You motherfucker!

992
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:42,601
Did you have to kiII
your chick in the sIum?

993
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:45,746
The pIace is crawling
with cops now!

994
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,004
Come on , Li'I Z e.

995
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:48,706
Come on? Fuck you !

996
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:51,016
I had to avenge my honor.

997
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:54,714
Her famiIy's turned me in .
You won't have any probIems.

998
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:58,015
The cops are everywhere
because of you .

999
01:09:58,227 --> 01:09:59,956
You're dead meat, asshoIe.

1000
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:02,096
Let up, Li'I Z e.
You've punished him enough .

1001
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:03,923
You know the Iaw.

1002
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:07,099
Anyone who kiIIs in my sIum
has to die as an exampIe.

1003
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:09,827
That was his business, Li'I Z e.

1004
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:12,607
Listen , you sonofabitch ,
get outta the sIum .

1005
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:14,967
You showed no respect,
understand?

1006
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:19,578
You know what, Benny?

1007
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:23,749
You're too nice. If you raise
a snake, expect to get bitten .

1008
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:25,853
He wasn't worth shit.

1009
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:28,384
A dirty traitor.

1010
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:29,751
Shut up, Tuba.

1011
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:32,059
I'm going for a waIk
with my girI .

1012
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:34,756
Okay, be carefuI .

1013
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:37,792
When things caIm down

1014
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,594
we'II get back to our business
with Carrot, okay?

1015
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:47,666
You need a girIfriend , Li'I Z e.

1016
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:10,559
Know what I'm thinking , Benny?

1017
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:13,567
That I'm so sexy?

1018
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:18,168
That too. But I mean ,
you know what we couId do?

1019
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:19,571
Make Iove again .

1020
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:20,970
I'm serious.

1021
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:27,345
We couId go away from here.
This vioIence sucks.

1022
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:29,849
Go where?

1023
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,849
To a farm .

1024
01:11:34,757 --> 01:11:36,657
We're reaIIy hippies at heart,
aren't we?

1025
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:40,951
A farm?

1026
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:46,456
Peace and Iove?

1027
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:24,533
Benny was just too cooI
to go on being a hoodIum.

1028
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:27,174
He succeeded
in getting everybody together

1029
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:28,432
for his goodbye party.

1030
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:29,736
The gangs.

1031
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:33,044
The souI crowd.

1032
01:12:37,953 --> 01:12:39,250
The reIigious crowd.

1033
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:40,854
One day, I'II go to church .

1034
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:44,991
The samba crowd.

1035
01:12:49,398 --> 01:12:50,660
The groovy crowd.

1036
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:57,600
And Li'I Ze, who had never
danced in his Iife.

1037
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,819
Want to dance with me?

1038
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:22,260
Want to dance with me?

1039
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:24,726
-I didn't hear.
-Want to dance?

1040
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:27,333
No, thank you ,
I'm with someone.

1041
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:43,642
Hey, Rocket!

1042
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:00,601
Come, I want to taIk
to you , buddy.

1043
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:04,695
You can't just spIit
with that chick.

1044
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,107
Why not?

1045
01:14:06,308 --> 01:14:10,210
I'm gonna go Iive on a farm ,
smoke pot, Iisten to rock.

1046
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:12,642
You wanna throw away
everything we've accompIished

1047
01:14:12,915 --> 01:14:13,813
for that bitch?

1048
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:17,117
She's not a bitch ,
she's my girI .

1049
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:20,653
We'II take over Carrot's
business, it'II be yours.

1050
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,818
Leave Carrot aIone,
he's a good guy.

1051
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:24,218
He's a motherfucker!

1052
01:14:24,526 --> 01:14:27,017
See? Everyone's a motherfucker
to you .

1053
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:29,221
That's why I'm Ieaving .

1054
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:31,658
I'm your friend ,
but I'm getting out.

1055
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:33,232
You got to understand ,
I have to go.

1056
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:38,929
I Iove you , man ,
but I've had enough .

1057
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:41,329
Motherfucker, Iet's see
if you have any baIIs.

1058
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:42,762
What is this?

1059
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:44,562
You wanna die?
Fuck off, bitch !

1060
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:48,767
Strip, nigger.
I wanna see your ass.

1061
01:15:49,177 --> 01:15:50,576
Hurry up!

1062

1063
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:55,748
I wanna see your ass.

1064
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:58,844
Come on , faggot!

1067
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:14,730

Hurry it up!

1070
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:35,512
What's up, Benny?

1071
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,816
This camera for a bag of coke?

1072
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:39,618
I don't deaI anymore.

1073
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:42,659
C'mon , do it for me.
You're my friend .

1074
01:16:42,864 --> 01:16:45,025
-Is it stoIen?
-It's okay, it's my dad's.

1075
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:46,660
Your dad's?

1076
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:50,731
Give it to Li'I Z e.

1077
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:52,165
Rocket wouId Iove this camera.

1078
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:56,434
-Yeah , here.
-Great.

-You wanna be a photographer?
-Yeah .

1081
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:31,611
Here's a present.

Shit, dude! This is great!

1083
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:38,019
Now move your ass.

Shake it!

1085
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:00,702
You'II take some great
pictures.

1086
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:04,507
Give me that.

1087
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:07,271
-Give me back the camera!
-No!

1088
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:13,682
What's your probIem?
Are you craz?

1089
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:55,720
They've kiIIed Benny!

1090
01:18:58,033 --> 01:19:00,866
Fuck! CaII an ambuIance!

1091
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:04,270
Where's the motherfucker
who did it?

1092
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:07,503
Z e, Benny is dead .

01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:10,109
No! CaII a doctor!

1094

Get out of here, bitch !

1095
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:22,813
Motherfucker!

1096
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:50,909
Where's Carrot?

1097
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:53,019
BIacky's here.

1098
01:19:55,524 --> 01:19:57,151
He's in troubIe.

1099
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:01,720
I'm fucked .

1100
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:04,155
-Why?
-I'm fucked .

1101
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:05,565
And you are too.

1102
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:07,332
I think I kiIIed Benny.

1103
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:09,528
Li'I Z e's coming
to take your pIace.

1104
01:20:09,938 --> 01:20:12,168
We can get him ,
he's in the dance haII .

1105
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,839
You kiIIed Benny?

1106
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:16,838
I didn't mean to. He moved .
I was aiming at Li'I Z e.

1107
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:19,142
Come on , Iet's go.

1108
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:20,439
BIacky.

1109
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:25,349
You kiIIed the cooIest
hood in the City of God .

1110
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:27,453
Let's go get Li'I Z e.

1111
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:37,793
Carrot knew
that without Benny

1112
01:20:38,066 --> 01:20:39,966
onIy a miracIe
couId save his business.

1113
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:42,668
We're fucked , man .

1114
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:54,706
But what better pIace

1115
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:59,276
for a miracIe to happen
than in the City of God?

1116
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,355
Look who's here.
My sugar babe.

1117
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:06,217
-Let me by.
-Gimme a kiss, girI .

1118
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:09,224
Let me by, pIease. Have you
seen what you Iook Iike?

1119
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:10,920
Come on , Li'I Z e.

1120
01:21:23,578 --> 01:21:24,772
Hi , honey.

1121
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:26,570
Everything okay, baby?

1122
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:36,451
The probIem was simpIe.

1123
01:21:36,758 --> 01:21:38,953
Li'I Ze was ugIy.

1124
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:41,056
Knockout Ned was handsome.

1125
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:43,458
Knockout Ned
couId get any girI.

1126
01:21:43,765 --> 01:21:47,257
Li'I Ze had to pay
or use force.

1127
01:21:48,169 --> 01:21:50,797
It was a dueI between
the handsome good guy

1128
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:53,465
and the ugIy bad guy.

1129
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:55,402
Let me go!

1130
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:00,813
Just enjoy it.

1131
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:10,118
You're mine now.

1132
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:17,427
Hey, faggot,
your broad's reaIIy hot!

1133
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:51,261
I can't even
Iook her in the face now.

1134
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:04,703
Why didn't that fucker kiII me?

1135
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:09,915
HoId on .

1136
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,517
Why didn't I kiII that fucker?

1137
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:15,247
Let's go back.

1138
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:18,526
-What about Carrot?
-We'II get back to him .

1139
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:19,856
You gonna kiII him?

1140
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:25,362
Knockout Ned ,
your chick's a sIut.

1141
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:27,325
Come out, motherfucker!

1142
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:29,435
Come out, you Ioser!

1143
01:23:29,637 --> 01:23:31,127
Take it easy.

1144
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:34,772
I'm going out. Let me go.

1145
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:36,534
Gerson ! Come back, son !

1146
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:07,697
This doesn't concern you , kid .
We're here for your brother.

1147
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:10,901
Let's taIk, we can work it out.
My brother's a peacefuI guy.

1148
01:24:11,112 --> 01:24:13,842
Is he too good-Iooking
to come taIk to me? CaII him .

1149
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:16,010
He hasn't done anything .

1150
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:17,913
You know who I am?

1151
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:22,917
-Li'I Z e, man .
-He's Li'I Z e.

1152
01:24:23,925 --> 01:24:25,859
CaII that motherfucker!

1153
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:28,222
Go on , man .

1154
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:36,169
CaIm down , I'II caII him .

1155
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,036
My arm !

1156
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:13,736
I hurt my arm .
Carrot wiII have to wait.

1157
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:16,135
That Ioser got what he
deserved .

1158
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:17,900
Let's go!

1159
01:25:42,637 --> 01:25:44,662
Gerson .

1160
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:49,576
That bastard kiIIed my brother.

1161
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:53,943
I can't Iet that go.

1162
01:26:10,198 --> 01:26:10,892
Want a gun?

1163
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:17,805
My son .

1164
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:20,605
CaIm down , mom .

1165
01:26:22,644 --> 01:26:23,110
PIease, mom .

1166
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:37,523
Do it right, asshoIe.

1167
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:39,322
There's no other way.

1168
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:41,654
How'd I Iet that Ioser hit me?

1169
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:43,720
Shit, that's some hoIe.

1170
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:17,494
-It's as if we were brothers.
-Shut up.

1171
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:19,792
Both of us hurt in the arm .
You by one brother, me the
other.

1172
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:22,128
It wouId be reaIIy funny
if we were brothers.

1173
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:27,798
That Knockout Ned's
not bad , eh?

1174
01:27:28,309 --> 01:27:31,608
He came out of nowhere.

1175
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:35,908
Shut up, Tuba!
You're a fucking pain !

1176
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:48,359
It was as if the City of God
had suddenIy found a hero.

1177
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:50,024
God bIess you , son .

1178
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:53,233
That kid was just asking
to be kiIIed .

1179
01:27:53,668 --> 01:27:54,635
WeII done.

1180
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:56,326
You did a good job.

1181
01:27:57,038 --> 01:27:58,938
You'd better go hide.

1182
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:10,012
I thought Knockout Ned
wouId start a revoIution here.

1183
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:13,110
But God had other pIans.

1184
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:14,520
Steak,

1185
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:17,119
where are aII the deaIers?

1186
01:28:17,692 --> 01:28:19,922
They're hiding .
Li'I Z e is in a bad mood .

1187
01:28:21,029 --> 01:28:24,226
They get us hooked and then
they go off and hide.

1188
01:28:24,899 --> 01:28:27,925
Do me a favor.
Go get some nose candy for me.

1189
01:28:28,236 --> 01:28:29,498
I'II try.

1190
01:28:29,837 --> 01:28:33,000
TeII them it's for Tiago,
to keep my buzz going .

1191
01:28:54,062 --> 01:28:54,960
Steak'n'fries,

1192
01:28:55,229 --> 01:28:58,062
go to Carrot's and teII him .

1193
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:04,065
Li'I Z e says that if you kiII
Knockout, he'II Ieave you aIone.

1194
01:29:05,573 --> 01:29:07,871
Hey, Knockout Ned .
Did you hear that?

1195
01:29:08,776 --> 01:29:10,266
Grab the kid !

1196
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:14,880
You heard the boy?

1197
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:17,477
If you don't stick with us,
you're dead .

1198
01:29:17,685 --> 01:29:19,084
I think you shouId join us.

1199
01:29:19,487 --> 01:29:22,115
We'II be partners.

1200
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:23,286
Drugs aren't my thing .

1201
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:25,584
This is just something
between me and him .

1202
01:29:26,494 --> 01:29:28,325
Those guys aren't worth shit.

1203
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:35,325
They'II do anything for power.

1204
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:38,528
Like this kid .

1205
01:29:39,907 --> 01:29:43,707
They're aII robots,
Iike this punk here.

1206
01:29:43,911 --> 01:29:45,310
What's in your head , kid?

1207
01:29:45,513 --> 01:29:47,708
Can't you see
you're wrecking your Iife

1208
01:29:47,915 --> 01:29:54,320
with that maniac and a bunch
of trigger-happy fooIs?

1209
01:29:55,156 --> 01:29:58,717
Are you craz?
You're just a kid .

1210
01:29:58,926 --> 01:30:01,656
A kid? I smoke, snort,

1211
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:04,828
I've kiIIed and robbed .
I'm a man .

1212
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:07,325
Shit, you have no idea!

1213
01:30:08,369 --> 01:30:12,533
He's attached to his gang .
You shouId join up with us.

1214
01:30:13,141 --> 01:30:15,234
ShaII we kiII him?

1215
01:30:18,446 --> 01:30:20,937
Steak,
we're going to grind you .

1216
01:30:22,984 --> 01:30:24,975
Okay, I accept.

1217
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:26,447
Great!

1218
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:28,179
TeII your boss

1219
01:30:28,456 --> 01:30:30,651
that Knockout Ned and Carrot
are now in command .

1220
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:32,389
But on one condition :

1221
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:37,458
no kiIIing of innocent peopIe.

1222
01:30:37,665 --> 01:30:39,155
I can't accept that,
understand?

1223
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,664
Okay, no innocent peopIe.

1224
01:30:43,371 --> 01:30:46,363
Steak fucked up!

1225
01:31:00,254 --> 01:31:01,346
Have you a gun for me?

1226
01:31:01,622 --> 01:31:05,854
No, but we can hoId up
a gun store.

1227
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:07,852
That's no probIem .

1228
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:10,158
I don't want to hoId up
anything .

1229
01:31:10,665 --> 01:31:11,859
I'm not a hoodIum .

1230
01:31:12,533 --> 01:31:16,264
This is a personaI affair
between me and him , okay?

1231
01:31:16,771 --> 01:31:18,636
I'm not a hoodIum .

1232
01:31:21,175 --> 01:31:22,767
He raped your chick,

1233
01:31:23,177 --> 01:31:26,840
kiIIed your uncIe and brother,
gunned your house,

1234
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:31,174
and you kiIIed one of his guys.

1235
01:31:31,752 --> 01:31:36,451
If you're not a hood ,
then get out.

1236
01:31:49,403 --> 01:31:51,394
This is a hoId-up!

1237
01:32:00,114 --> 01:32:01,308
The first time...

1238
01:32:01,816 --> 01:32:03,113
Where are the revoIvers?

1239
01:32:03,651 --> 01:32:07,519
Knockout Ned saved a saIescIerk
form being shot by Carrot.

1240
01:32:07,722 --> 01:32:09,212
We said no kiIIing !

1241
01:32:09,724 --> 01:32:11,351
That's the ruIe.

1242
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:19,766
We want the boss's money.
Everyone keep caIm .

1243
01:32:20,167 --> 01:32:23,364
You want us to go? We do too.

1244
01:32:23,938 --> 01:32:28,170
Look at the ground !

1245
01:32:28,576 --> 01:32:34,845
The second time, Carrot saved
Knockout Ned's Iife.

1246
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:38,143
Ned Iearned that there's
an exception to every ruIe.

1247
01:32:38,586 --> 01:32:41,453
Exception to the ruIe.

1248
01:32:41,956 --> 01:32:44,151
-Are you the manager?
-Yes.

1249
01:32:44,592 --> 01:32:46,184
This is a hoId-up.

1250
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:47,859
Everyone on the ground !

1251
01:32:48,162 --> 01:32:51,859
On the ground !

1252
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:58,162
Give me the money!

1253
01:32:58,472 --> 01:32:59,871
I'm not kidding .

1254
01:33:00,308 --> 01:33:02,799
The first person who moves
is dead !

1255
01:33:03,244 --> 01:33:06,509
The third time,
the exception becomes the ruIe.

1256
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:24,120
With the hoId-up money

1257
01:33:24,332 --> 01:33:26,732
Carrot and Knockout Ned
prepared to face Li'I Ze.

1258
01:33:27,134 --> 01:33:28,761
Carrot couId protect
his business.

1259
01:33:30,338 --> 01:33:31,828
Knockout Ned,

1260
01:33:32,139 --> 01:33:34,937
the best marksman in his
battaIion, wanted revenge.

1261
01:33:35,176 --> 01:33:38,839
First, the ItaIians.
This is a 9 mm .

1262
01:33:39,146 --> 01:33:40,841
-Let me see.
-Not bad , eh?

1263
01:33:41,148 --> 01:33:42,240
The sight isn't weII-aIigned .

1264
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:45,241
I'II give you a good price.

1265
01:33:45,753 --> 01:33:46,845
The 1 2mm .
The ''hand job''.

1266
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:50,453
See why?

1267
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:55,258
An Uzi , 9mm . It's IsraeIi .

1268
01:33:55,763 --> 01:33:57,355
The star of David .

1269
01:33:57,865 --> 01:33:58,763
Jewish .

1270
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,160
I want a 30-06.

1271
01:34:00,534 --> 01:34:04,095
Now we can start having fun .

1272
01:34:04,538 --> 01:34:07,837
The war's on .
Let's start with a prayer.

1273
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:11,801
Our father who art in heaven ,

1274
01:34:12,113 --> 01:34:14,411
HaIIowed be thy name. . .

1275
01:34:32,533 --> 01:34:34,364
HoodIums have guns,
but can't shoot.

1276
01:34:34,869 --> 01:34:36,530
One buIIet from Knockout Ned

1277
01:34:36,771 --> 01:34:38,762
was worth ten
from Li'I Ze's gang.

1278
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:40,764
Li'I Ze couIdn't take it.

1279
01:34:41,175 --> 01:34:43,040
He counter-attacked.

1280
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:48,642
The sIum had been a purgatory,
now it was heII.

1281
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:50,048
I decided to get out.

1282
01:34:54,255 --> 01:34:59,659
That's how I became a reporter.

1283
01:35:00,795 --> 01:35:03,491
Great photo!

1284
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:06,598
I bet it's by Rogerio Reis.

1285
01:35:06,834 --> 01:35:09,496
What did I teII you?

1286
01:35:09,804 --> 01:35:11,499
Like any pro,

1287
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:15,142
I started at the bottom,
way down at the bottom.

1288
01:35:15,509 --> 01:35:20,412
Without knowing
what awaited me.

1289
01:35:20,648 --> 01:35:23,515
Instead of going home
I'd go over to the paper.

1290
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:26,915
A guy from the City of God
worked in the Iab.

1291
01:35:27,154 --> 01:35:29,418
Check this out.

1292
01:35:29,657 --> 01:35:31,249
He heIped me

1293
01:35:31,525 --> 01:35:34,050
move cIoser
to what I Ioved most in Iife.

1294
01:35:34,328 --> 01:35:36,319
-Hi , Rogerio.
-How are you , Pierre?

1295
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:38,862
This is Rocket.
He's a photographer.

1296
01:35:39,133 --> 01:35:40,361
HeIIo, Rocket.

1297
01:35:40,668 --> 01:35:42,932
-He's a fan of yours.
-ReaIIy?

1298
01:35:43,170 --> 01:35:44,569
You have good taste, Rocket!

1299
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:47,831
-WeII , I'm done. I'm off.
-See you .

1300
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:50,840
What a cooI guy!

1301
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:54,738
What shouId have been
a swift revenge

1302
01:35:54,982 --> 01:35:56,950
turned into an aII-out war.

1303
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:04,683
The City of God was divided.

1304
01:36:04,992 --> 01:36:08,689
You couIdn't go
from one section to the other.

1305
01:36:08,996 --> 01:36:11,089
Not even to visit a reIative.

1306
01:36:11,332 --> 01:36:15,029
The cops considered anyone
Iiving in the sIum a hoodIum.

1307
01:36:15,302 --> 01:36:18,237
PeopIe got used to Iiving
in Vietnam.

1308
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:28,147
And more and more voIunteers
kept signing up to die.

1309
01:36:28,516 --> 01:36:29,312
This kid . . .

1310
01:36:29,517 --> 01:36:29,949
What do you want?

1311
01:36:30,251 --> 01:36:31,912
A boy from Carrot's gang
punched me.

1312
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:34,314
The war was an excuse
for everything.

1313
01:36:34,555 --> 01:36:36,523
Li'I Z e's soIdiers
kicked my ass.

1314
01:36:36,724 --> 01:36:40,353
Take this .22 .

1315
01:36:42,263 --> 01:36:45,755
The jerk who raped my sister
is with Carrot.

1316
01:36:46,033 --> 01:36:46,761
Li'I Z e evicted my famiIy.

1317
01:36:47,067 --> 01:36:49,934
KiII . . .
Be respected .

1318
01:37:02,583 --> 01:37:03,709
I'm Tiago, a friend of Benny's.

1319
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:06,475
Can you read? Can you add?

1320
01:37:06,987 --> 01:37:09,888
I'm pretty good in business.

1321
01:37:10,925 --> 01:37:12,688
Okay, get to work.

1322
01:37:12,893 --> 01:37:13,689
What do you want?

1323
01:37:13,994 --> 01:37:16,485
To get my father's murderer.

1324
01:37:16,797 --> 01:37:17,627
What's your name?

1325
01:37:17,898 --> 01:37:20,093
My name's Otto.

1326
01:37:24,939 --> 01:37:26,907
What's the matter?

1327
01:37:27,107 --> 01:37:29,837
-He's a worker.
-But he wants a gun .

1328
01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:32,135
He won't Iast a week.

1329
01:37:45,526 --> 01:37:47,926
A year Iater, no one remembered

1330
01:37:48,162 --> 01:37:50,130
how it had aII begun.

1331
01:37:50,364 --> 01:37:51,331
Take that!

1332
01:37:54,735 --> 01:37:57,727
For both sides, the aim was

1333
01:37:57,938 --> 01:38:00,771
to take over the enemy's
business in order to buy

1334
01:38:01,075 --> 01:38:03,771
more guns and take over
more businesses.

1335
01:38:27,501 --> 01:38:28,991
I smoke, snort,
I've kiIIed and robbed.

1336
01:38:29,236 --> 01:38:30,134
I'm a man.

1337
01:38:53,661 --> 01:38:56,027
The media started
taking an interest.

1338
01:38:56,263 --> 01:38:58,163
The poIice had to intervene.

1339
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,012
A gang Ieader

1340
01:39:14,281 --> 01:39:17,011
from the City of God
was arrested today.

1341
01:39:17,284 --> 01:39:19,013
ManueI Machado,
aka Knockout Ned,

1342
01:39:19,286 --> 01:39:22,278
was hospitaIized after being
wounded by Li'I Ze's gang.

1343
01:39:22,489 --> 01:39:25,083
Our reporter interviewed him.

1344
01:39:25,292 --> 01:39:27,226
Is the war
stiII going on?

1345
01:39:27,494 --> 01:39:29,086
It's stiII going on.

1346
01:39:29,496 --> 01:39:31,293
Have many peopIe died?

1347
01:39:31,598 --> 01:39:33,793
Many have died.

1348
01:39:34,034 --> 01:39:35,899
MostIy innocent peopIe.

1349
01:39:36,236 --> 01:39:39,797
Just knowing me is enough

1350
01:39:40,107 --> 01:39:44,737
to get you kiIIed by Li'I Ze.

1351
01:39:45,045 --> 01:39:46,012
The poIice don't go in there?

1352
01:39:46,246 --> 01:39:50,649
They go after me, not him.

1353
01:39:50,918 --> 01:39:54,911
I've been in jaiI, whiIe he
goes on kiIIing undisturbed.

1354
01:39:55,122 --> 01:39:57,147
And they don't arrest him.

1355
01:39:57,424 --> 01:39:59,654
Knockout Ned says
the war wiII continue.

1356
01:39:59,927 --> 01:40:01,758
PoIice Chief Guedes

1357
01:40:02,062 --> 01:40:04,963
has promised
to arrest both of the gangs.

1358
01:40:14,141 --> 01:40:15,972
Motherfucker!

1359
01:40:16,243 --> 01:40:20,339
I'm the boss here, but he gets
his picture in the paper!

1360
01:40:20,581 --> 01:40:23,573
-Have you found mine?
-Just Knockout Ned's.

1361
01:40:23,784 --> 01:40:25,445
Keep Iooking .

1362
01:40:25,652 --> 01:40:28,450
At Ieast my name's
got to be in there.

1363
01:40:28,655 --> 01:40:29,952
-There's nothing .
-Can you read?

1364
01:40:30,157 --> 01:40:32,648
Just the pictures.

1365
01:40:33,761 --> 01:40:34,659
Nothing .

1366
01:40:36,363 --> 01:40:39,059
Hey, what the fuck
are you doing?

1367
01:40:39,266 --> 01:40:40,460
It's just the want ads.

1368
01:40:40,768 --> 01:40:43,862
I don't care, read everything !

1369
01:40:44,171 --> 01:40:45,866
But there aren't any articIes.

1370
01:40:46,173 --> 01:40:48,164
Want a buIIet in your head?

1371
01:40:50,811 --> 01:40:53,371
Gotta show them
who's boss here.

1372
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:01,050
-Give me the camera!
-No way!

1373
01:41:05,426 --> 01:41:06,916
Take my picture, man .

1374
01:41:07,127 --> 01:41:09,254
I can't work it.

1375
01:41:10,431 --> 01:41:11,261
Go ahead .

1376
01:41:11,532 --> 01:41:12,965
I'II hoId the Beretta.

1377
01:41:14,134 --> 01:41:16,329
Let me try.

1378
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:18,538
Back off.

1379
01:41:18,839 --> 01:41:20,739
There's no cIick.

1380
01:41:22,943 --> 01:41:24,843
What a bunch of bozos!

1381
01:41:25,145 --> 01:41:29,172
I'm fucked , with you guys.

1382
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:31,577
I have an idea.

1383
01:41:31,785 --> 01:41:37,348
I'II go get a guy I know.
Hang Ioose.

1384
01:41:38,959 --> 01:41:42,190
Here he is.

1385
01:41:44,164 --> 01:41:45,256
Take the camera.

1386
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:47,464
WeII , kid?

1387
01:41:47,768 --> 01:41:49,463
Aren't you a photographer?

1388
01:41:49,703 --> 01:41:52,672
Make the camera work.
We can't do it.

1389
01:41:52,873 --> 01:41:54,272
Take our picture.

1390
01:42:01,515 --> 01:42:04,951
-You fucking broke it.
-It wasn't me.

1391
01:42:05,252 --> 01:42:06,719
I found it.

1392
01:42:09,523 --> 01:42:11,354
It has to be wound .

1393
01:42:16,163 --> 01:42:17,357
What's your name?

1394
01:42:17,664 --> 01:42:18,858
Rocket.

1395
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:21,761
Another picture, Rocket.

1396
01:42:22,035 --> 01:42:23,764
How about two rows?

1397
01:42:24,037 --> 01:42:25,231
What?

1398
01:42:25,572 --> 01:42:26,561
Two rows.
Everyone with their guns.

1399
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:28,933
You're outside,
for Christ's sake!

1400
01:42:29,243 --> 01:42:31,677
TaIk to him niceIy, kid .

1401
01:42:31,945 --> 01:42:35,142
Sorry.
Move in , pIease.

1402
01:42:38,252 --> 01:42:40,584
Another one.

1403
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:48,186
I think the roII's finished .

1404
01:42:48,462 --> 01:42:49,759
Then show us the pictures.

1405
01:42:49,963 --> 01:42:51,760
They have to be deveIoped .

1406
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:53,864
DeveIoped?

1407
01:42:54,168 --> 01:42:56,068
How much is it?

1408
01:42:56,370 --> 01:42:57,997
Take this money.

1409
01:42:58,272 --> 01:43:00,297
And bring back the pictures.

1410
01:43:00,607 --> 01:43:03,041
I have to remove the fiIm .

1411
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:06,245
Keep the camera.

1412
01:43:06,513 --> 01:43:08,413
Benny wanted to give it to you ,
didn't he?

1413
01:43:08,649 --> 01:43:10,344
-It's yours.
-Thanks.

1414
01:43:12,119 --> 01:43:14,519
Don't forget the pictures.

1415
01:43:14,721 --> 01:43:16,814
The photos, Rocket!

1416
01:43:27,334 --> 01:43:30,030
-Pierre!
-What?

1417
01:43:30,337 --> 01:43:32,931
Can you deveIop this for me?

1418
01:43:34,374 --> 01:43:37,434
I can't, Rocket.
I couId get into troubIe.

1419
01:43:37,744 --> 01:43:40,645
It's onIy for the paper's
reporters. I couId risk my job.

1420
01:43:40,847 --> 01:43:42,041
-Pierre?
-Yes, Rogerio?

1421
01:43:42,382 --> 01:43:44,247
DeveIop these for me.

1422
01:43:44,451 --> 01:43:46,578
This one too, okay?

1423
01:43:46,753 --> 01:43:48,948
I'm going to Iunch .

1424
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:54,156
You're Iucky.
What size?

1425
01:43:54,394 --> 01:43:55,258
What?

1426
01:43:55,596 --> 01:43:58,064
For the enIargement, what size?

1427
01:43:58,365 --> 01:44:01,801
WeII . . .
Whatever you think is best.

1428
01:44:26,526 --> 01:44:27,652
-Here.
-Thanks.

1429
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:29,327
I'm in deep shit now.

1430
01:44:32,666 --> 01:44:33,860
I'm as good as dead .

1431
01:44:46,346 --> 01:44:48,576
Someone had signed
my death sentence.

1432
01:44:48,749 --> 01:44:52,241
I wanted to bash the jerk's
face in.

1433
01:44:57,858 --> 01:45:00,224
Are you Marina?
You stoIe my photos.

1434
01:45:00,527 --> 01:45:03,519
Because of you ,
I'm dead .

1435
01:45:03,797 --> 01:45:05,492
Dead? StoIe? What do you mean?

1436
01:45:05,632 --> 01:45:07,691
Not so Ioud .

1437
01:45:07,901 --> 01:45:10,893
Not so Ioud?
I'II be kiIIed because of you .

1438
01:45:11,238 --> 01:45:14,503
You were gone,
your photos were in the Iab.

1439
01:45:14,741 --> 01:45:16,208
There's nothing I can do.

1440
01:45:16,510 --> 01:45:18,205
The photos in our Iab

1441
01:45:18,512 --> 01:45:20,241
are photos to be pubIished
in the paper.

1442
01:45:20,514 --> 01:45:23,711
I saw the photos,
I pubIished them .

1443
01:45:23,950 --> 01:45:24,541
You stoIe them .

1444
01:45:24,818 --> 01:45:26,649
I did not. Here they are.

1445
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:28,114
-Give them to me.
-Just a second .

1446
01:45:28,355 --> 01:45:31,950
Here are your photos.

1447
01:45:32,225 --> 01:45:35,717
Are there any others?

1448
01:45:35,962 --> 01:45:38,624
CaIm down .
What's your name?

1449
01:45:38,865 --> 01:45:41,766
-Rocket.
-Rocket?

1450
01:45:42,736 --> 01:45:44,966
Nice to meet you .
I'm Marina.

1451
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:48,831
Now, reIax.
I have money for you .

1452
01:45:49,142 --> 01:45:51,235
For your pictures.

1453
01:45:51,578 --> 01:45:53,978
Here, when we use a picture

1454
01:45:54,247 --> 01:45:56,181
we pay the photographer.

1455
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:57,940
Do you want to be
a photographer?

1456
01:45:58,185 --> 01:45:59,447
Yes.

1457
01:45:59,653 --> 01:46:01,484
Great start!
On the front page.

1458
01:46:01,788 --> 01:46:03,483
How'd you get these photos?

1459
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:05,590
I Iive there.

1460
01:46:05,826 --> 01:46:09,922
Rocket, no photographer has ever
been abIe to go in there.

1461
01:46:11,098 --> 01:46:13,293
If you couId bring us
more pictures of Li'I Z e,

1462
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:17,937
the paper wouId buy them .

1463
01:46:18,205 --> 01:46:20,696
We'd pay you .

1464
01:46:20,941 --> 01:46:23,307
CouId you?

1465
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:25,410
I don't know.

1466
01:46:25,645 --> 01:46:27,112
What's the probIem?

1467
01:46:27,347 --> 01:46:30,111
The probIem? I can't go there
anymore at night.

1468
01:46:30,317 --> 01:46:32,512
And during the day?

1469
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:34,346
It's too risky.

1470
01:46:36,656 --> 01:46:40,956
Look, man ! They've finaIIy
understood that I'm the boss.

1471
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:45,764
What's your
photographer-friend's name?

1472
01:46:46,066 --> 01:46:46,760
Rocket.

1473
01:46:47,033 --> 01:46:49,763
He's good . I'II take more
to show the others.

1474
01:46:52,839 --> 01:46:56,741
So, Rocket,
is it yes or no?

1475
01:46:57,944 --> 01:46:59,844
It's a great opportunity.

1476
01:47:03,517 --> 01:47:04,779
Okay.

1477
01:47:06,219 --> 01:47:07,618
You made the right choice.

1478
01:47:07,888 --> 01:47:09,082
Very good !

1479
01:47:09,489 --> 01:47:12,083
I'II give you some fiIm ,
Ienses,

1480
01:47:12,325 --> 01:47:15,783
and even another camera. I'II
show you the equipment room .

1481
01:47:16,897 --> 01:47:20,025
There's another probIem .

1482
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:23,292
-What is it?
-Where can I sIeep tonight?

1483
01:47:24,037 --> 01:47:26,938
I can't go back now.

1484
01:47:29,509 --> 01:47:32,239
This is a 1 35mm .

1485
01:47:32,512 --> 01:47:34,139
WiII you be cIose up
or far away?

1486
01:47:34,414 --> 01:47:35,142
Far away.

1487
01:47:35,415 --> 01:47:37,508
-Can you measure the Iight?
-Yes.

1488
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:44,115
Aren't you too cIose?

1489
01:47:45,525 --> 01:47:48,517
I don't know what spurred me
to go taIk to them Iike that.

1490
01:47:49,529 --> 01:47:51,656
Maybe I was going to die,

1491
01:47:51,932 --> 01:47:55,265
but now I had a camera

1492
01:47:55,535 --> 01:47:58,663
and a chance
to become a photographer.

1493
01:47:58,939 --> 01:48:01,464
Watch out for the dog shit.

1494
01:48:01,775 --> 01:48:05,074
Not to mention that
the night was stiII young.

1495
01:48:05,479 --> 01:48:07,276
Want something to eat?

1496
01:48:07,514 --> 01:48:08,708
No, thank you , ma'am .

1497
01:48:08,982 --> 01:48:12,213
Nothing to eat?
Nothing to drink?

1498
01:48:12,486 --> 01:48:13,578
Ajoint?

1499
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:15,811
Try this.

1500
01:48:36,243 --> 01:48:38,302
It's time to go to sIeep.

1501
01:48:40,514 --> 01:48:43,915
I'II show you your bed .

1502
01:48:44,150 --> 01:48:45,708
You have hot water, don't you?

1503
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:49,513
Yes. You've never
taken a hot shower?

1504
01:48:49,723 --> 01:48:51,918
-No.
-What do you do?

1505
01:48:52,125 --> 01:48:55,356
We heat up the kettIe.

1506
01:48:55,662 --> 01:48:57,152
Why are you standing there?

1507
01:48:57,430 --> 01:48:59,330
What room do I sIeep in?

1508
01:48:59,566 --> 01:49:04,060
UnfortunateIy,
there's onIy one room .

1509
01:49:04,471 --> 01:49:05,768
You have to sIeep with me.

1510
01:49:06,072 --> 01:49:09,473
I won't go into the detaiIs
of my first sexuaI experience.

1511
01:49:09,776 --> 01:49:11,471
Just reIax.

1512
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:15,605
Because, eIsewhere

1513
01:49:15,882 --> 01:49:18,476
another more important
sex scene for the sIum

1514
01:49:18,785 --> 01:49:21,618
was taking pIace.

1515
01:49:21,888 --> 01:49:24,686
Carrot was heIping
Knockout Ned escape

1516
01:49:24,925 --> 01:49:27,291
without firing a shot.

1517
01:49:28,495 --> 01:49:29,826
The poIiceman guarding him

1518
01:49:30,096 --> 01:49:32,826
was in the wiIIing hands
of the nurse.

1519
01:49:33,099 --> 01:49:35,090
And in the meantime

1520
01:49:37,203 --> 01:49:39,603
to eIiminate Carrot, Li'I Ze
was investing in munitions.

1521
01:49:39,839 --> 01:49:43,036
He invested heaviIy,
even if he couIdn't pay.

1522
01:49:44,110 --> 01:49:45,304
Remember the doubIe-barreI?

1523
01:49:45,612 --> 01:49:47,307
I aIready have it.

1524
01:49:47,547 --> 01:49:49,208
This is a repeater rifle.

1525
01:49:49,549 --> 01:49:52,541
You don't have this one,
the Browning .

1526
01:49:52,752 --> 01:49:53,548
It'II shoot down a pIane.

1527
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:55,950
I'm not shooting down pIanes.
And the one I asked for?

1528
01:49:56,222 --> 01:49:59,749
The AR-1 5, UncIe Sam .

1529
01:50:00,026 --> 01:50:03,223
You can't get them in BraziI .

1530
01:50:03,563 --> 01:50:05,030
My ass, UncIe Sam .

1531
01:50:07,934 --> 01:50:10,027
I have a soIution .

1532
01:50:10,337 --> 01:50:12,134
The Rugger. Ever seen one?

1533
01:50:12,372 --> 01:50:16,832
It's Iike the AR-1 5.
Same caIiber, but Iighter.

1534
01:50:17,143 --> 01:50:20,237
With an infrared sight?
400 shots a minute?

1535
01:50:20,647 --> 01:50:21,443
It depends.

1536
01:50:21,748 --> 01:50:23,238
It depends, my ass!

1537
01:50:23,483 --> 01:50:26,475
Trying to fuck me over?

1538
01:50:26,753 --> 01:50:28,345
I'II fuck you over first.

1539
01:50:28,655 --> 01:50:32,648
You Ieave now
without the money or the guns.

1540
01:50:32,859 --> 01:50:34,258
What do I teII the boss?

1541
01:50:34,461 --> 01:50:35,485
That's your probIem .

1542
01:50:35,762 --> 01:50:37,457
You'II think of something .

1543
01:50:37,764 --> 01:50:40,062
You heard him , chubby?
Get out.

1544
01:50:40,367 --> 01:50:43,393
Beat it, fatso.

1545
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:45,262
Li'I Ze had made a big mistake.

1546
01:50:45,672 --> 01:50:46,661
He shouId have known

1547
01:50:46,873 --> 01:50:49,899
that behind every saIesman
Iies a suppIier.

1548
01:50:50,210 --> 01:50:52,178
And they don't joke around.

1549
01:50:53,813 --> 01:50:56,475
Have you seen this?

1550
01:50:56,683 --> 01:50:58,913
What do they need an AR-1 5 for?

1551
01:50:59,219 --> 01:51:00,948
These stories wiII push
the poIice to investigate.

1552
01:51:01,221 --> 01:51:05,021
They'II nab you .
And me, aIong with you .

1553
01:51:05,325 --> 01:51:08,624
Think I'm going
to give you away?

1554
01:51:12,632 --> 01:51:15,430
Don't worry,
I'II take care of it.

1555
01:51:15,635 --> 01:51:17,569
But don't fuck up again .

1556
01:51:24,377 --> 01:51:25,639
CharIie!

1557
01:51:27,647 --> 01:51:29,581
Come here!

1558
01:51:29,849 --> 01:51:31,339
Listen ,

1559
01:51:31,651 --> 01:51:33,243
you teII him .

1560
01:51:35,055 --> 01:51:38,149
Let's go make that sIeaz
IittIe deaIer pay up.

1561
01:51:51,271 --> 01:51:53,068
Come here, kids!

1562
01:51:54,407 --> 01:51:56,705
Do you Iike chicken?

1563
01:51:57,010 --> 01:51:57,999
It depends.

1564
01:51:58,278 --> 01:51:59,870
We'II eat some chicken

1565
01:52:00,213 --> 01:52:01,805
and have Carrot for dessert.

1566
01:52:02,115 --> 01:52:04,015
I have a present for you .

1567
01:52:04,217 --> 01:52:05,115
Here.

1568
01:52:10,557 --> 01:52:12,548
A big one for you .

1569
01:52:12,759 --> 01:52:14,818
Are you reaIIy giving us
these guns?

1570
01:52:15,128 --> 01:52:19,724
Yes, but I want you on my side,
against Carrot.

1571
01:52:19,933 --> 01:52:21,764
Then can we hoId up
anyone we want?

1572
01:52:22,035 --> 01:52:24,833
Not in the sIum .

1573
01:52:25,138 --> 01:52:26,571
-Can you shoot?
-More or Iess.

1574
01:52:26,773 --> 01:52:27,762
More or Iess?

1575
01:52:28,041 --> 01:52:30,566
Hey, you guys,
come heIp these kids.

1576
01:52:30,844 --> 01:52:33,438
I know. You do it Iike this.

1577
01:52:54,667 --> 01:52:55,861
Get that chicken !

1578
01:52:57,670 --> 01:52:58,659
C'mon , Iet's go.

1579
01:53:09,816 --> 01:53:11,807
If Li'I Z e catches you ,
he'II kiII you .

1580
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:16,618
Yeah , weII ,
he's gotta find me first.

1581
01:53:24,831 --> 01:53:27,823
Hey, kid ! Get that chicken !

1582
01:53:30,570 --> 01:53:32,128
Shit! The cops!

1583
01:53:32,338 --> 01:53:34,738
HeII , don't fucking run off!

1584
01:53:35,041 --> 01:53:35,939
Give me that.

1585
01:53:47,654 --> 01:53:51,852
Hey, MeIonhead !
You fucking fag !

1586
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:53,250

1604
01:56:26,546 --> 01:56:27,410

1622

Not you .
You're a present for the media.

1623
02:00:12,138 --> 02:00:13,435
Does it come to 1 0,000?

1624
02:00:13,739 --> 02:00:14,728
AImost. That's aII I have.

1625
02:00:14,974 --> 02:00:16,771
That's aII there was, Chief.

1626
02:00:17,043 --> 02:00:18,032
We searched everywhere.

1627
02:00:18,344 --> 02:00:20,244
Let him go.

1628
02:00:20,446 --> 02:00:22,573
What about this ring?
Is it goId?

1629
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:35,859
FiII it up.
You'II owe us the rest.

1630
02:00:40,166 --> 02:00:41,656
Fucking war!

1631
02:00:44,670 --> 02:00:47,070
Knockout Ned is dead
and I'm dead broke!

1632
02:00:47,273 --> 02:00:49,673
You're fucked , eh?

1633
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:51,399
Kids,

we'II have to do a few hoId-ups
to get my business going again .

1635
02:00:55,681 --> 02:00:57,308

The business is ours!

1640
02:02:07,153 --> 02:02:11,556

This one wiII make me famous.

1642
02:02:15,828 --> 02:02:17,318
It'II even make the cover
of a magazine.

1643
02:02:20,966 --> 02:02:22,627
I won't have to worry
about Li'I Ze anymore.

1644
02:02:26,439 --> 02:02:28,168
But the cops?

1645
02:02:36,649 --> 02:02:40,244
Gangster, SeIf-styIed ''Boss''
Of The City Of God, Shot Dead

1646
02:02:45,291 --> 02:02:47,657
This photo couId've
gotten us kiIIed?

1647
02:02:47,893 --> 02:02:49,451
I think so.

1648
02:02:49,662 --> 02:02:51,152
A Ieast it got you a job.

1649
02:02:52,665 --> 02:02:54,098
Not a job, an internship.

1650
02:02:54,367 --> 02:02:56,267
It pays a IittIe, doesn't it?

1651
02:02:56,902 --> 02:02:57,869
A IittIe.

1652
02:02:59,505 --> 02:03:01,496
What about that Iady
journaIist? Was she a good Iay?

1653
02:03:01,741 --> 02:03:03,504
More or Iess.

1654
02:03:03,709 --> 02:03:05,142
You didn't Iike it?

1655
02:03:05,411 --> 02:03:07,538
I don't think journaIists
know how to screw.

1656
02:03:07,913 --> 02:03:08,709
Yeah , I guess so.

1657
02:03:08,948 --> 02:03:10,813
Cocoa robbed 3 houses
in Barra.

1658
02:03:11,117 --> 02:03:13,108
Better kiII him .

1659
02:03:13,319 --> 02:03:15,014

02:03:15,321 --> 02:03:20,315
-It was Beef.

It's a deaI .

1665
02:03:35,241 --> 02:03:37,573
Have you heard
of the Red Brigade?

1666
02:03:37,843 --> 02:03:40,243
No, but if they come,
we'II kiII them .

1667
02:03:40,646 --> 02:03:43,843
-Who knows how to write?
-Me, sort of.

1668
02:03:44,150 --> 02:03:46,175
Let's make a bIack Iist.
We'II kiII them aII .

1669
02:03:46,452 --> 02:03:48,852
Put fucking Nightowl on there.

02:03:49,054 --> 02:03:50,078
And Croquet.

1671
02:03:50,356 --> 02:03:51,983
Leonard , too,
he owes me money.

1672
02:03:52,258 --> 02:03:56,058
And China-Man ,
he thinks he's hot stuff.

1673
02:03:56,362 --> 02:03:58,057
And CIaudio.

1674
02:03:58,364 --> 02:03:59,797
Where's Giant?

1675
02:04:00,065 --> 02:04:01,498
Come on , Giant!

1676
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:09,901
I forgot to say,

1677
02:04:10,209 --> 02:04:12,143
my name isn't Rocket anymore.

1678
02:04:12,411 --> 02:04:16,404
I'm now WiIson Rodrigues,
photographer.

1679
02:04:37,736 --> 02:04:38,964
ManueI Machado,
aka Knockout Ned,

1680
02:04:39,238 --> 02:04:42,833
was hospitaIized after being
wounded by Li'I Ze's gang.

1681
02:04:43,075 --> 02:04:46,044
On Ieaving the hospitaI,
our reporter interviewed him.

1682
02:04:46,278 --> 02:04:49,247
Many have died.
MostIy innocent peopIe.

1683
02:04:49,448 --> 02:04:51,643
Just knowing me is enough,

1684
02:04:51,851 --> 02:04:54,945
just being my friend.

1685
02:04:55,187 --> 02:04:59,055
If he thinks someone knows me,

1686
02:04:59,291 --> 02:05:00,781
he'II kiII them.

1687
02:05:01,093 --> 02:05:03,288
The poIice don't go in there?

1688
02:05:03,496 --> 02:05:10,732
They go after me, not him.

1689
02:05:11,003 --> 02:05:13,995
I've been in jaiI 3 times,
whiIe he goes on

1690
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:16,333
kiIIing undisturbed.

1691
02:05:16,709 --> 02:05:20,008
And they don't arrest him.

1692
02:05:20,312 --> 02:05:22,542
Knockout Ned says
the war wiII continue.

1693
02:05:22,748 --> 02:05:24,613
PoIice Chief Guedes
has promised to arrest

1694
02:05:24,817 --> 02:05:27,718
both gangs in the City of God.
