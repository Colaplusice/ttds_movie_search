1
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:34,134
Tell you what...
Read the dosage on the package.

2
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,097
Yes, they go by size.

3
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,643
Get a tablet
and hide it in her kibble.

4
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:50,109
I think half should be enough,
but...

5
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,612
look at the dosage...
Stop it !

6
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,740
No, sorry, I didn't mean you.

7
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,368
I was talking to my dog.

8
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,662
I have a Labrador, yes.

9
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,874
Get down ! Yes, yes...

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,168
Yes, they're very affectionate dogs.

11
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,505
With children,
but particularly with adults.

12
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,174
- Where are you going ?
- I told you, to Chicca's.

13
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,553
- I don't believe you.
- Don't then.

14
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,930
You're seeing Gregorio.

15
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,557
No !

16
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,063
By telling lies, you're hurting
yourself more than me.

17
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,942
What a pain ! Chicca
and I are meeting the others.

18
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,695
- Gregorio might be there.
- Why do you need these ?

19
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,157
- They're not mine.
- They were in your bag.

20
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,034
- I'm holding them for Chicca.
- Think I'm stupid ?

21
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,454
And stop rummaging through my bag.

22
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,082
God ! You drive me crazy !

23
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,585
I know the feeling !

24
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:57,176
Rosa, it's late, time for bed.
Come with mommy.

25
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,554
- Say night-night to grandma.
- Night-night.

26
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:04,099
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bruno, I want you in bed by ten.

27
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,186
- Hear that ? Ten o'clock.
- And no fuss.

28
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,105
He doesn't make a fuss with grandma.

29
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,233
- Because you spoil him.
- That's not true !

30
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,235
Forget it.

31
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,995
I've stopped taking the pill.

32
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,749
- I'm glad.
- Really ?

33
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,001
Yes.

34
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,009
Your daughter spews lies.

35
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,641
- You've got nothing to say ?
- Well, she's 17...

36
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,227
- It's normal.
- She's going out with Gregorio.

37
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,648
- So ? They're an item.
- I don't like him.

38
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,777
- She does.
- Rocco, you don't like him either.

39
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:01,531
No, I don't like him either.
But it's pointless trying to stop her.

40
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:06,787
Your parents didn't like you dating me,
but it made no difference.

41
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:11,667
How many teens have you treated,
Eva ? Some still thank you.

42
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,796
- Try to be a bit more detached.
- She's my daughter.

43
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:19,132
- I can't be detached.
- You're always criticizing her.

44
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,677
She criticizes me !

45
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,072
- I'll take that.
- Thanks.

46
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,704
- Wait, I forgot my phone.
- Hurry, it's late !

47
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,353
She's got condoms in her bag.

48
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,859
- How do you know ?
- I found them.

49
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,236
- You searched her bag ?
- I was looking for something.

50
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,113
Eva !

51
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,242
Sofia's going through the drama
of leaving the family unit.

52
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:31,246
Then let's allow her to
without being pains.

53
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:35,876
It would be wrong, she needs
a conflict to define herself,

54
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,211
a model to detach herselffrom,
understand ?

55
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,132
Eva, my mother was a green...

56
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,259
- Oh God !
- A greengrocer.

57
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,346
You can't imagine
how much simpler it was.

58
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,766
I left the family unit
without my parents even noticing.

59
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:55,020
My mom would ask: "Where's Rocco ?"
"Dunno, has he gone out ?"

60
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:02,277
PERFECT STRANGERS

61
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,910
- Lovely moon. What time's the eclipse?
- Dunno.

62
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:14,039
Why did we call Bruno Bruno ?

63
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:18,251
- Huh ?
- My father'sAmedeo, yours is Ennio.

64
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,922
What were we thinking calling him
"Bruno" ? Do you like it ?

65
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,175
So now we're having doubts
10 years later ?

66
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,302
No...

67
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,391
- And don't talk back to mom like that.
- Like what ?

68
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,893
Like you did.

69
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:49,950
- It's biodynamic, will it be okay ?
- For 25 euros it'd better be !

70
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,831
- Pull over and we'll get another.
- Bianca...

71
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,418
- It's a dinner, not a wine tasting.
- But Eva's a nitpicker.

72
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,962
I'm not in the mood to hear her.

73
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:05,424
Then we'll say I bought it,
so she can pick on me.

74
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,845
- What are you doing ?
- Taking the price off.

75
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,223
Are you crazy ? 25 euros.
Stick it on the cork !

76
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,230
I'll get it.

77
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,360
- Hello.
- How are things ?

78
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,988
- Has Peppe arrived yet ?
- Not yet.

79
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,367
I made a tiramisu.
Cosimo and Bianca are on their way up.

80
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,454
- Okay. Ricotta or mascarpone ?
- Mascarpone.

81
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,748
Let's see ifyou have the guts
to say yours is better.

82
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,958
Come in.

83
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,501
Hi !

84
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,964
- I made a tiramisu. Sofia ?
- In her bedroom.

85
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,092
- I'll go and say hello.
- No, leave her be.

86
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,094
- You're at war ?
- Guerrilla warfare.

87
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,013
What happened ?

88
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,392
I found condoms in her bag.

89
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,144
No !

90
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,898
- God, what if Rosa does that ?
- Rosa's not even 6 !

91
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,777
- Hello ?
- Come in. Hi, Bianca !

92
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,031
- Hi.
- Hi, everyone. Where's Peppe ?

93
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,116
He's not here yet.

94
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,285
- White.
- It's biodynamic.

95
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,370
You fell that hoax...

96
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,916
- Whyjust one bottle ?
- It's biodynamic.

97
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,169
- What does that mean ?
- It means 25 euros.

98
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,131
Shall we pay him back ?
In installments.

99
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,301
- How do you picture this broad ?
- "This broad" is Lucilla.

100
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:36,264
- And don't start.
- She must be pretty to be with Peppe.

101
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:40,018
She mustn't be very pretty
to be with Peppe.

102
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,063
- Why not ?
- Women like men like Peppe.

103
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:47,025
- He's a wonderful man.
- He's easy to fall in love with.

104
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,946
Yes, he's reassuring,
protective, gentle...

105
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,073
- Yes.
- What a bore !

106
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:57,827
"He's easy to fall in love with" ?
Watch what you say, blondie.

107
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,539
What if she's old ?

108
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,043
- Like a MILF !
- Eva and I are MILF age.

109
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,213
- Speak for yourself, darling.
- I mean a real old lady.

110
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,091
With a perm, a handbag...
how do we react ?

111
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:16,346
- She's got to be better than Emanuela.
- Don't even mention her name !

112
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:20,225
- Who's Emanuela ?
- Peppe's ex-wife.

113
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,978
- She was anything but pretty.
- No.

114
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:27,857
Now that it's all over
I gotta say that hoarse voice of hers

115
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,485
turned me on a bit.

116
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,239
It was before...

117
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,576
You're saying it was after ?
I wouldn't be so sure.

118
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,120
- But she was strange.
- Yes.

119
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,623
It's not bad, this bio...

120
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,002
They're here !

121
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,640
Good evening, everyone.
Hi, guys.

122
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,520
- What's up ?
- Where's Lucilla ?

123
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,522
She has a fever.

124
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,985
- So she's not coming ?
- No, she has a fever.

125
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:16,156
- We really wanted to meet her.
- I know, she's disappointed too.

126
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,286
- Do you want me to go ?
- No !

127
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,123
- How are you ?
- Fine, thanks.

128
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,171
- She's ditched you already.
- Don't start that.

129
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,256
- Did you two fight ?
- No.

130
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,426
- How old did you say she was ?
- I didn't say.

131
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,304
- But she's our age.
- Ouch !

132
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,015
- What ?
- She's old then.

133
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:46,394
- It's a mature relationship.
- We said no jokes about Lucilla.

134
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,314
- No, it's for Peppe.
- Thanks.

135
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,316
- But Lucilla's not here.
- Right.

136
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:55,528
But I am.
And you were saying... what ?

137
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,530
- The usual things.
- Such as ?

138
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,660
Just... we don't know her,
so we were trying to guess.

139
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,037
Will she be tall, short...

140
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:08,166
The usual, no...
Is she a redhead, brunette...

141
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,336
- Blonde.
- We even thought she might be gray.

142
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,463
- Gray ?
- Yes.

143
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,090
Leave him alone !

144
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,301
- Come on, the eclipse has started.
- Let's go !

145
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,970
- I can see two.
- There are two.

146
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,599
- I can see two because I can't see.
- Use this to focus it...

147
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,686
Now I can see it ! It's lovely.

148
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,481
Lucilla's a nice name.

149
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,359
- Peppe and Lucilla. Sounds good.
- Yes.

150
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:38,113
About Lucilla, why don't you
tell us something about her ?

151
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,615
- What do you want to know ?
- Are you in love ?

152
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,368
How do I know...

153
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:47,247
Eva, how do you know
ifyou're in love ?

154
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,250
- Why are you asking me ?
- You study these things.

155
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:54,754
I'll tell you. Ifyou talk to her
for 30 minutes a day, you're in love.

156
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:59,134
- What if I talk for 60 minutes ?
- Then you're madly in love.

157
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,137
Then you stop talking,
which means you're married.

158
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:06,516
- How long have you been together ?
- Awhile, a few months.

159
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:10,478
Great ! The first sparks.
Are you ablaze ?

160
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,522
- Are you ?
- I'm ablaze.

161
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,399
- He's ablaze.
- I'm ablaze.

162
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,527
Why did you choose tonight
to introduce us ?

163
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,530
I didn't choose, itjust happened.

164
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,992
Do you remember the evening
I met you all ?

165
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,288
- I was so anxious !
- Why ?

166
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,667
- She was so tense, poor girl.
- Meeting Cosimo's friends !

167
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,670
All for this sweet deal here...

168
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,382
From that point ofview,
Lucilla wasn't worried.

169
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,551
- Lucky her.
- That's why she has a fever !

170
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,514
- I changed outfits 10 times that day.
- 20.

171
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:52,187
But apparently it went well,
I feel like one of the gang now.

172
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,190
- Who, you ?
- One of the gang ?

173
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,442
No way !

174
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,530
Darling, look at their faces.
They're teasing.

175
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,658
- They're teasing.
- Of course we are.

176
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:09,454
- You're our favorite.
- Cosimo, you got lucky.

177
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,332
It wasn't luck.
Hands off, surgeon.

178
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,459
- Leave me alone !
- Hands off.

179
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,711
How many do you see ?

180
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,464
Two.

181
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,468
- This sauce is good. What is it ?
- Capers and olives.

182
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,554
This summer we'll bring a ton of capers
back from the seaside.

183
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,226
Here they charge 7.50 euros
for a jar this size.

184
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,814
Damn ! I should grow capers
on my land in hills.

185
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,234
- Capers in the hills ?
- Yeah, 7.50 euros !

186
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,821
Please, you're not growing
capers now !

187
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,365
Laugh all you want,
it's a good business.

188
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,243
- Any news on the house in Salina ?
- Not yet.

189
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:53,456
- First trip without Chiara and Diego.
- I spoke to her, she says hello.

190
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,876
- How is she ?
- Miserable, back with her parents.

191
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,505
Her husband's having an affair
with a girl their daughter's age...

192
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:04,759
- It'll take time to get over it.
- She's nearing menopause, almost 50.

193
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:08,221
- She'll never get over it.
- I have lots of patients like her.

194
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,515
See ?

195
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,269
- Did you know about it ?
- About what ?

196
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,230
- About this girl ?
- No.

197
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,149
- Of course they knew !
- Of course.

198
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,609
How could we know ?

199
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:26,614
- Why, do you tell ifyou know ?
- Ifyou're a friend, yes.

200
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,784
You're saying ifwe'd known about it

201
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:34,873
we should've told Chiara her hubby
was screwing a 23-year-old hottie ?

202
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,917
- 23 years old ?
- 22.

203
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,628
- Almost 22.
- You're a bunch of shits.

204
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,631
No, these are delicate issues.

205
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,801
If all hell breaks loose,
they'll say it's your fault

206
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,803
for poking your nose in.

207
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,181
- Peppe's right.
- All right, but I'm warning you.

208
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,435
If Cosimo cheats on me,
I want you to tell me.

209
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,562
- Ifyou really want to know...
- Idiot.

210
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:01,691
- They'd never give each other away.
- They're all the same.

211
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,444
- A losing battle.
- We're too different.

212
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,946
Like a PC and a Mac.

213
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,199
- And what are men ?
- A PC, obviously.

214
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,786
Cheap, they pick up viruses,
and only do one thing at a time.

215
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:17,206
When Lele's in the shower,
he can either wash or sing.

216
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,835
- Otherwise he freezes up.
- Very funny !

217
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,962
Hilarious !

218
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:27,717
And women are Macs.
Intuitive, fast, elegant.

219
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,470
Expensive and compatible
only among themselves.

220
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,348
Yes, but they're addictive too.

221
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:38,186
- What will happen to Diego now ?
- Nothing.

222
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,731
- He's got no wife and kids.
- And a 22-year-old girlfriend.

223
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,984
- A hellish life !
- Having to watch TV talent shows,

224
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,446
going to Justin Bieber concerts,
getting drunk on beer...

225
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,616
While your ex strips you
of everything: house, money, car...

226
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,577
Don't exaggerate !

227
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,621
- Everything !
- Just ask Peppe.

228
00:15:56,747 --> 00:16:01,626
I'm no example, my wife
nearly had to pay me alimony.

229
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,965
A lawyer, however despicable,
knows how much a P.E. teacher earns.

230
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:12,512
Nasty business though ! Afamily
breaking up because of a text.

231
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,765
- A 22-year-old slut, you mean.
- Almost 22.

232
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,979
But if Chiara hadn't read that text...

233
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,981
So it's her fault for reading it ?

234
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,402
No, but he could've at least
deleted the text...

235
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,405
He was screwing a young girl,
he should've been careful.

236
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,866
- What ?
- Should've been careful about what ?

237
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:38,913
- About the text or being a shit ?
- Don't take it out on me !

238
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,793
Lele, pass me the eggplant patties.
It's hot !

239
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,922
Cosimo's right,
you do have to be careful.

240
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:56,889
We have everything in here.
It's the black box of our lives.

241
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:01,519
How many couples would split up
if they looked at each other's phones ?

242
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,818
Lele would never let me see his.

243
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,954
What's the problem ?
Here, take it.

244
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,832
- Oh I will.
- Go ahead.

245
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,710
Lele, cut that out.

246
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,588
- Look, his hand's trembling.
- He's turned pale.

247
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:32,300
I insist you take it,
but put yours up here too.

248
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,595
Sure, all you'll find are messages
from the pediatrician

249
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,972
and your sister
asking about your mom.

250
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,851
- Why does she ask you ?
- Do you ever answer your phone ?

251
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,855
- Would you let Cosimo have yours ?
- I don't even have a passcode.

252
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,692
Darling, I wouldn't want yours.

253
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,612
Rocco would rather swallow his,
wouldn't you, love ?

254
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,866
That's not true. Here.
You'll find a few tits and asses,

255
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,118
but all tools of the trade.

256
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:04,082
So you're saying
that none of us has a secret ?

257
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,005
- All saints, apart from Diego ?
- Eva, what...

258
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:15,468
- What secrets could we have ?
- We know each other too well.

259
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:19,764
Yes, let's hope there are some secrets
or what a bore !

260
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,642
- Let's play a game then.
- What kind of game ?

261
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,020
- We'll find out.
- What ?

262
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:32,026
Come on, we'll all put
our phones on the table.

263
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,906
- Then what ?
- While we're eating,

264
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:42,036
texts, WhatsApp messages, calls,
whatever arrives, we share it.

265
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:46,415
- We don't have any secrets.
- What sort of game is that ?

266
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,043
- It might be fun.
- Think so ?

267
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,505
- Yes.
- Come on ! Let's do it.

268
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,133
- Do what ?
- This is mine.

269
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,928
- Of course, Lucilla's at home.
- I'd take part anyway.

270
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:03,141
- Not even your mom calls you.
- What kind of game is this, Eva ?

271
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,769
- Afun game.
- I don't think so.

272
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,564
Got something to hide ?

273
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,900
I'm worried that
you might have something to hide.

274
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,027
I don't want to know
ifyou're cheating.

275
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,947
If I were cheating,
I wouldn't have suggested this game.

276
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,908
Or you are
and you want to be found out.

277
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,579
There's this psychological mechanism
according to which...

278
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,832
serial-killers do all they can
to get found out.

279
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:31,085
Let's do. We can stop ifwe get bored.

280
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:36,549
Yes, it's like when we played
truth or dare as kids.

281
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:41,053
So what ? We used to jerk off
together as kids too.

282
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,932
- I didn'tjerk offwith you.
- No, you did it alone.

283
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,477
- Cosimo, put your phone on the table.
- Huh ?

284
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,605
Get your phone out.

285
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:59,071
- Should I be worried ?
- No ! Of course not !

286
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:03,075
Here you go, it's not a problem.

287
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,828
Are we really doing this ?

288
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,873
It's rude to keep phones
on the table while eating.

289
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:14,503
- Yes, Diego always switched his off.
- Lele leaves his face down.

290
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,759
- What ?
- You leave it face down.

291
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,094
Think I haven't noticed ?

292
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,974
It's not intentional.
I pull out my phone and place it down.

293
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,102
Ifyou scratch the screen
it costs 200 euros to replace it.

294
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,022
- 50 in Chinatown.
- Let's scratch it then.

295
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,527
Look here, look...
I'll put it face up.

296
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,781
I'll get mine.
But I'm warning you...

297
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:46,535
- If mom calls, I'm not answering.
- If the allergic dog client calls,

298
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,914
I'm not answering it,
otherwise it's all yours.

299
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,794
- Come on, let's see what happens.
- You do agree this is really stupid ?

300
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:59,131
- It's really stupid.
- Fucking stupid, come on, guys !

301
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,549
Dad ?

302
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,135
- Sofia.
- Hi, Sofia !

303
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,055
- Hello, everyone.
- She gets prettier every day.

304
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,892
- She takes after her mother.
- Can you come here ?

305
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,811
Excuse me.

306
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,024
Can I have some money, please ?

307
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:22,571
- Why didn't you ask in there ?
- Not in front of mom.

308
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,575
- What happened ?
- The usual.

309
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,786
You argued ?

310
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,831
- How old is Sofia ?
- 17 in June.

311
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,584
I remember when we celebrated
her birthday in Circeo.

312
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,462
- She was 10, right ?
- Yes, 10.

313
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,589
- Seems like yesterday.
- Great...

314
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:44,176
"Time flies by so fast !"
has been said.

315
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,054
- "This used to be a farm..."
- "All Blacks have rhythm."

316
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,849
Don't forget
"Pippo Baudo is very professional".

317
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,477
- That's enough, guys.
- Hold it, first text.

318
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,938
- It's mine.
- Shall we read it ?

319
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,606
Yes.

320
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,112
"I want your body" ?
Who's it from ?

321
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:06,365
- I don't know.
- We're off to a good start.

322
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,992
What does it mean ?

323
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,744
- I don't know.
- Who sent it ?

324
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,121
The number's not in my phone,
I don't know.

325
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,624
Must be the wrong number,
I don't know.

326
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,002
What do I do ?

327
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:24,258
- It's the number from the text.
- Answer it.

328
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,720
- Answer it.
- Yeah, right.

329
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,640
- Put it on speaker.
- Yes. Take it easy.

330
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:35,269
I'll put it on speaker.
Hello ? Who is it ?

331
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,025
Hello ?

332
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,029
No answer...

333
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,032
Hello ? Who's that ?
Who is it ?

334
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,368
It's fucking me.

335
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,750
- What is wrong with you ?
- It was a joke.

336
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,127
- Fuck off !
- What kind ofjoke is that ?

337
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,381
- You're such a...
- He's a loser.

338
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,257
- You're a loser.
- Really.

339
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,303
- Just playing around.
- I knew it was a joke.

340
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,306
- Go fuck yourself !
- Bullshit !

341
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,895
Give me my phone, I'm going out.

342
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,939
- Say bye at least.
- Bye.

343
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,941
- Bye, Sofia.
- Bye, Sofia.

344
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,778
- I said hello to them before.
- She said hello before.

345
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,200
- She's not always like that.
- She's often worse.

346
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,411
They're unbearable at that age.

347
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,080
- What were you like at her age ?
- Me ?

348
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,959
- What was he like ?
- I remember what he was like.

349
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,213
He was... help me out.

350
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,799
Superficial.

351
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,971
Perfect adjective. He only loved
soccer and something else.

352
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,307
- Don't listen to him, darling.
- His mom was desperate.

353
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,726
- Distraught.
- Whereas their mothers were happy.

354
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:01,063
I'm not sure I'd be a good mother.

355
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,942
- Why, are you pregnant ?
- No, no...

356
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,111
Are you trying ?

357
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,491
- You could say that.
- Congratulations then !

358
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,870
There's nothing to celebrate yet.

359
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:19,373
Well, at least someone's screwing !

360
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,877
We haven't even eaten
the first course yet, easy !

361
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:26,088
What's the big deal ?
Nobody here would be shocked.

362
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,214
So ?

363
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:32,261
After all these years of marriage,
no one screws like in the early days.

364
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:35,389
They're trying for a baby,
it's not...

365
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:39,894
A more sober toast then. To children
and the meaning they give our lives.

366
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,897
Bummer,
I preferred the screwing toast.

367
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,274
Peppe, you're never satisfied.

368
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:50,488
I don't like this idea that life has
no meaning ifyou don't have kids.

369
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,783
- It's sometimes a convenient decision.
- What do you mean ?

370
00:24:55,410 --> 00:25:00,998
You have a kid, get on with life
and think of nothing else.

371
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:05,169
- I don't want a kid just to do that.
- Why else then ?

372
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,796
- For a thousand reasons.
- Give me one.

373
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,425
- One. To complete the couple.
- For example.

374
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,930
So two people can't be happy
without depending on someone else.

375
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,266
- You're a pain !
- The other day we argued about God.

376
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:23,312
It's the same thing in the end.
I don't want their help.

377
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:26,148
I want to be
the meaning of my own life.

378
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:29,818
I'm selfish and I'll die selfish.
Cheers.

379
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:33,322
Sometimes having children
can be selfish.

380
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:40,037
- Why selfish ?
- It's a generous act, isn't it ?

381
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,457
No, sometimes it can just be
the fear of growing old.

382
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,794
Many hope a child
can give them a second life.

383
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,965
I don't torment myself about it.
I've enjoyed having a daughter.

384
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:54,218
I agree with Rocco.
You can make fun of me,

385
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,846
but the best moment of the day
is when I put Rosa to bed.

386
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:02,977
She looks at me and says I'm so
beautiful. That makes me happy...

387
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:07,064
- Happy, happy...
- We get the message, you're happy.

388
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,109
- Did she say "happy"?
- There was an echo.

389
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:15,239
We'll talk again when she's 16
and tells you to piss off.

390
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:20,619
Don't say that, and it's true,
kids give you a second chance.

391
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:24,331
It's like going over your life
again through them.

392
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:28,335
You see, I don't want
to go over my life again.

393
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:32,381
Because you had a shitty life.
I wasn'tjoking.

394
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,136
- It's my sister, what do I do ?
- Answer it.

395
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,222
- Put it on speaker.
- Hi, Marta.

396
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,891
- Peppe, the speaker.
- Wait a minute.

397
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,520
- Hi.
- Hi.

398
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:50,899
- Careful, you're on speaker.
- That's not fair !

399
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,153
- Speaker ?
- Yes, you're on speaker.

400
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,531
- You can't tell her.
- Turn it off.

401
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,159
- I can't.
- Why not ?

402
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,162
- I just can't, Marta.
- What's all that noise ?

403
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,040
- I'm at Rocco and Eva's.
- Game over.

404
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:10,044
- Hello, Marta.
- Hello, everyone. Okay...

405
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:14,048
- I'II caII back.
- I'm not going to Anzio, got it ?

406
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,675
We'll talk about it tomorrow. Bye.

407
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,930
- Sorry, I messed up.
- You messed up ?

408
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,683
I wasn't ready.
I'll get it right next time.

409
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,395
- What was that aboutAnzio ?
- My sister found me a job

410
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,314
in a private school.

411
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,941
- Why not go ?
- It's too far away.

412
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:38,072
- You can't be picky these days.
- It'd be nice to work at the seaside.

413
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,908
I'd jump at the chance
to move to Anzio.

414
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,287
What was that ?

415
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:48,082
- You'd jump at the chance to move...
- To Anzio.

416
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,959
Yes, why not ?

417
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,921
You'd move to Anzio tomorrow ?

418
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:58,342
- Tomorrow, you'd move...
- She heard. We said it three times.

419
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:02,429
Okay, I only said it
to encourage Peppe.

420
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:06,100
- He's not a kid, you know.
- I've sent my résumé everywhere.

421
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:10,229
- Something will turn up.
- It doesn't work that way.

422
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,233
- Am I on trial ?
- Anyway, they can't fire you like that.

423
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,320
They didn't, theyjust didn't renew
my contract, it's different.

424
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:23,242
It's worse. You've had a temporary
contract for the last 10 years.

425
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:28,497
- It's illegal, you could sue.
- Thanks, but I don't need help.

426
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:32,626
I want to solve this on my own,
without any pressure.

427
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,255
- And without going to Anzio.
- That's right, take your time...

428
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:39,508
- Peppe, get a fucking move on !
- That's enough !

429
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:45,723
As soon as I shut the shop,
I bought a taxi.

430
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:50,018
- Let's follow his example !
- Joke all you want.

431
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,522
I'm moving ahead,
I've put my taxi license up for sale.

432
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:57,651
- You haven't started paying for it yet.
- You're selling it ?

433
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:01,238
- I want to see what it's worth.
- When were you going to tell me ?

434
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,741
- I was going to.
- When ?

435
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:07,119
- It's only an idea, it's not...
- As usual.

436
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:11,039
- This time it's the right decision.
- It always is.

437
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:15,669
Guys, the world's changing fast.
Car2go, car-sharing...

438
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:19,798
Uber. Ever heard of them ?
Taxis will be extinct soon.

439
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:23,677
- So I'm looking to the future.
- Like with e-cigarettes.

440
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:30,392
- He had bad luck that time.
- I blame the tobacco lobby.

441
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:35,063
They financed the revolution
in Nicaragua.

442
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:40,068
- Which is situated exactly...
- I'll tell you later where it is.

443
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,322
- But at least I tried.
- Like when you bred Yorkshires.

444
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,076
You're indefensible.

445
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,454
Were Lady and the Tramp
to blame that time ?

446
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,456
Come on...

447
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,792
Pass me that plate ?

448
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:02,090
- You baked the zucchini flowers ?
- Did you want them fried ? Lele !

449
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,181
- Did you get your license back ?
- No.

450
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,727
- Not until the trial is over.
- When's the hearing ?

451
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,356
- At the end of June.
- Are you worried ?

452
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,568
No, just tired.
I can't wait until it's all over.

453
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:26,615
- Is everything sorted ?
- The lawyer says I'll be cleared.

454
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,492
We'll celebrate this summer then.

455
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,620
Who is it ?

456
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,123
It's dad.

457
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,501
- Zucchini flowers...
- I'm famished.

458
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,628
- Sit down.
- Put it on speaker.

459
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,634
- Hi, dad.
- Hello, darling, how are you ?

460
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,012
- Fine, I've got friends for dinner.
- l won't keep you then.

461
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,599
l spoke to Blanchard, he said
you can have the operation in Rome.

462
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,727
He comes down twice a month
to the Quisisana Clinic.

463
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,146
l'll send you his number,
call him.

464
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,358
Thanks, dad, bye.
Say hello to mom.

465
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:07,531
- What operation is that ?
- It's nothing serious.

466
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,160
Augmentation mammoplasty.

467
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,292
I'm getting a boob job.

468
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,377
- A boob job ?
- Yes.

469
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,422
- Why didn't you tell me ?
- You're a therapist !

470
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,550
- So what ?
- Therapists don't get boob jobs.

471
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:30,679
- It does seem strange.
- Why ? I don't like my boobs.

472
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:37,185
- You should make yourself like them.
- Therapists should accept themselves.

473
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:41,398
Awoman who has a boob job
doesn't accept herself ?

474
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,526
No.

475
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:50,324
- I accept everything but my boobs.
- Let Rocco do it.

476
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,285
- Why don't you do it ?
- Why don't I do it ?

477
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,579
Because her consultant father said no.

478
00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:01,585
Only the best for his daughter.
Dr. Blanchard, a VIP surgeon

479
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:07,299
who operates in Italy, but lives
in Switzerland. Not Rocco Buccilli.

480
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:11,178
Who does boob and ass jobs
for cashiers and secretaries.

481
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:14,348
I do two for one:
two boobs for the price of one.

482
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,684
- Are you done ?
- It's true.

483
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,354
- No.
- Then enlighten me.

484
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,941
A husband can't do
his wife's boob job.

485
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,443
It's a matter of common sense.

486
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,946
You'd lose all sexual attraction.

487
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,824
- I agree with Eva.
- The cook never feels like eating.

488
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,744
- That's a good one.
- He does it all the time.

489
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,747
He says, "You know what ?
You eat it all !"

490
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:42,250
This is the official reason,
her father considers me an idiot.

491
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,213
- That's not true.
- He wanted a heart surgeon for her.

492
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:50,217
- A luminary like himself.
- That's enough.

493
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:55,472
Why don't you let Blanchard do one
boob, and your husband the other ?

494
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,517
- Without knowing which one.
- Then decide which is better.

495
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:03,355
No, get daddy to decide:
"Dad, which is Blanchard's boob ?"

496
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,860
I really shouldn't say this,
but she doesn't need it.

497
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:13,240
- He paid you a compliment.
- It must be the eclipse.

498
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,660
Eva's right, it's like you
going to her for therapy.

499
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,290
It's unthinkable, right ?

500
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:27,546
You don't get it, it would be
unthinkable for him to go to therapy !

501
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:32,551
I'm put off by how long it takes,
but I'd like to try.

502
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:36,430
You're good at sitting
on a sofa for hours !

503
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,683
You're a real comedian tonight !

504
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:44,646
This need to talk about
my private business to a stranger...

505
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:48,442
No offense Eva,
but it's not for me.

506
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,902
You can talk to friends instead.

507
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,448
- I have him...
- And it's free too.

508
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:59,327
He won't go because he thinks
therapy is a waste of time.

509
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:03,582
Admit it, I won't be offended.
You think myjob is a waste of time.

510
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:06,835
- Why do you say that ?
- Because it's what you think.

511
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:10,297
I don't, I think we do
very similarjobs.

512
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,467
You do brain jobs, I do boob jobs.
We make people feel better,

513
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:17,345
it's just that you take years,
and I take a few hours.

514
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,433
- Whose is that ?
- Not mine.

515
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,351
- Not mine.
- Calm down.

516
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,937
- It's the gnocchi.
- I'll go.

517
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,608
- Hand me your plates.
- Thanks, Carlotta.

518
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,112
- I'll go smoke.
- I'll come with you.

519
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:48,085
- What's the moon like ?
- It's partly covered.

520
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,342
- Peppe, I've got a problem.
- What kind ?

521
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,387
Well...

522
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,724
every night at 10:00
a friend of mine...

523
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,520
- She sends me...
- A goodnight kiss ?

524
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,524
Sort of.
She sends me a photo.

525
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,653
- She sends you a photo !
- A photo.

526
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,780
What kind of photo ?

527
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,740
A photo of herself.

528
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,662
You're in trouble.

529
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,997
I need you to help me out.

530
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:31,795
- How can I help you ?
- We have the same phone.

531
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,923
We'll swap them,
just until the photo arrives.

532
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:38,176
- Then I'll receive the photo. Come on !
- But you're single.

533
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,762
No, pal, not any more.

534
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,931
Okay, but Lucilla's
not here with you tonight.

535
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:46,560
- You could have refused to play.
- I'm in the shit. Help !

536
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,562
No, I don't want to.

537
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:52,691
Do you want all hell to break loose
for something so petty ?

538
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:57,445
Peppe doesn't want to
so he'll ruin an entire family.

539
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:09,666
And what kind of photos
are you talking about ?

540
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:14,337
- Just an ordinary photo.
- Don't show me up, or else...

541
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:19,050
Peppe, two nights ago she sent me
a photo of her in Pluto pajamas.

542
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,846
- You see...
- Pluto ?

543
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,432
- Pluto.
- How old is she ?

544
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,060
I don't know.

545
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:35,984
- Are you going to help me or not ?
- What a pain !

546
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,743
I'm not sure I should tell you,
but your husband's in therapy.

547
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,246
Rocco ?

548
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,835
Are you serious ?

549
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,962
Who told you ?

550
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,965
Lele.
But don't say a word, okay ?

551
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,886
Whose phone is that ? Mine ?

552
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,764
Who is it ?

553
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,227
- Steve Jobs.
- Who ?

554
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:15,023
- I thought he was dead.
- And why would he call my wife ?

555
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,609
- Darling !
- I'm coming !

556
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:20,904
- It's urgent.
- Who is it ? Mom ?

557
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,782
No... Steve Jobs.

558
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,535
- Answer it.
- I don't speak English.

559
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,913
Answer it ! Don't be silly !

560
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,043
- Hello, Riccardo.
- Good evening, Mrs. Masi.

561
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,671
- Your computer's ready.
- Great.

562
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:41,800
- How come you're working so late ?
- Overtime, too many viruses about.

563
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:47,055
I'll come get it tomorrow
around 7:00 ?

564
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:50,058
- Sounds good.
- See you tomorrow.

565
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,936
It's the computer guy.

566
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,689
- And you call him "Steve Jobs" ?
- Isn't it funny ?

567
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,692
And do you call the mechanic
"Marchionne" ?

568
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:05,699
- Text. One, two...
- Giulio for soccer.

569
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,202
- Giulio soccer.
- Giulio, confirmed for tomorrow.

570
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,955
- You were lucky.
- There's a game tomorrow ?

571
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,919
- Apparently.
- I didn't get a text.

572
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,173
It'll come through,
it mightjust be a bit late.

573
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,926
Is your phone out of minutes ?

574
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:30,849
- Have you kicked me off the team ?
- No, Giulio just organized it...

575
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,185
- You know what he's like.
- What is he like ?

576
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,105
- Absent-minded.
- Don't you know Giulio ?

577
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,234
Get your gym bag ready anyway.

578
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,111
Yes, come anyway.

579
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:48,867
You're such shits, you only include me
when you're short a goalie.

580
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:53,371
- Do you really do that ?
- That's not true.

581
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,123
- Nonsense.
- Terrible !

582
00:38:55,583 --> 00:39:00,837
- Are you Alice in Wonderland ?
- Why ? If they're such good friends...

583
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:04,132
Some friends ! I didn't
get a message on WhatsApp.

584
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:08,636
Turn it off then back on again,
sometimes...

585
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:12,724
- He's right, sometimes...
- You're such shits.

586
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,853
Message for Cosimo. Who is it ?

587
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,274
Marika.
"Call me, it's urgent."

588
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:26,029
- Three exclamation points.
- Who's Marika, what's so urgent ?

589
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,157
- Who is she ?
- The name sounds promising.

590
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:33,661
Sorry to disappoint you, but
she's just the taxi company dispatcher.

591
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:40,001
You know ? "Go to Corso Rinascimento
in nine minutes."

592
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,253
Call her back, I'm curious about her.

593
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:48,009
We're eating and she might make me
fill in for someone.

594
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:52,055
- Yes, a shift swap.
- Look at her defending her husband !

595
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:56,684
- They haven't been married long !
- Darling, stick up for yourself.

596
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,064
If I have to fill in for someone,
my weekend's ruined.

597
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,193
- We're at my parents' on Sunday.
- Then she'll save your weekend.

598
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:12,325
Anyway, Marika isn't his type.
She's a hick

599
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:15,954
with tattoos and enormous boobs !

600
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,165
What's her surname ?
Perhaps I did her boob job.

601
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,965
- It's mine, an American app.
- Can I see ?

602
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,430
- Where are you going ?
- What is this ?

603
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,099
- An exercise program.
- What ?

604
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:40,478
It lasts 12 weeks

605
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,731
and you can lose
from 8 to 12 kilos.

606
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:47,360
- Guaranteed success.
- You only started today then !

607
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:50,113
- Do you have to do it now ?
- Whenever it pings.

608
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,074
- Even at night ?
- Yes, if it pings.

609
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,869
- Then turn it off.
- I can't cheat.

610
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:59,247
How can I teach P.E.
looking like this ?

611
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,959
Does the app know you ate half
a kilo of gnocchi in 30 seconds ?

612
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,462
- I'm burning them off.
- Dammit...

613
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:14,220
That's brilliant. Where did
you find it ? I want it too.

614
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:18,892
- I downloaded it.
- Have you heard of it ? I haven't.

615
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:22,145
- On a full stomach.
- I swapped our phones.

616
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:26,107
- Are you sure ?
- Huh ?

617
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,735
- Are we sure ?
- Don't bust my balls.

618
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,744
Why didn't you tell me ?

619
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:40,413
- What ?
- That you're in therapy.

620
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,291
Why didn't you tell me ?

621
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:50,131
- I haven't been going long.
- How long ?

622
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,800
About six months.

623
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,928
That's long enough.

624
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,264
- Are you angry ?
- No.

625
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,392
Yes...

626
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,063
I don't know, a bit.

627
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:09,192
- You never wanted to before.
- I do now.

628
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,445
You do now ? Why ?

629
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:16,199
Maybe it is just a waste of time,
but I want to try everything.

630
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:21,955
Then ifwe split up,
we can't say we didn't try.

631
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:30,046
- And is it working ?
- I don't know, you tell me.

632
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:43,726
- But I've learnt something important.
- What's that ?

633
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:48,606
- How to defuse.
- Meaning ?

634
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:53,111
Not to turn every argument
into a fight for supremacy.

635
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:57,323
I don't believe it's weak
to be the one to give in.

636
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,617
In fact, I think it's wise.

637
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:04,372
The only couples I see who last
are those where one of the two...

638
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:08,334
manages to take a step back,
but is really a step ahead.

639
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,009
I don't want us to end up like...
Barbie and Ken.

640
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:21,264
You full of plastic
and me without any balls.

641
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:31,024
- I'll change my shirt, it's sticky.
- Good idea.

642
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:46,164
- The wine's good.
- WhatsApp for Peppe.

643
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,542
- The only one who's not worried.
- It's a photo.

644
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,919
From Isa Clementini.

645
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:56,007
- Wait, it's not Lucilla !
- Why are you shouting ?

646
00:43:56,133 --> 00:44:00,011
- To emphasize it.
- Isa Clementini sometimes sends me...

647
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,266
You'll break it.

648
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,685
- What's up ?
- Nothing...

649
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,937
- What is it ?
- Can I have a look ?

650
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,940
- It's private.
- Everyone's sharing tonight.

651
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,652
- Let us see.
- Show us or I'll get up...

652
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:20,156
- Show us that photo.
- Get your hand off it !

653
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,076
- Let go !
- Okay.

654
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,162
Tonight everyone can look...

655
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,416
Well I'll be damned, Peppe !

656
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,710
- You chipped it.
- Let me see.

657
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:36,339
- Just a sec !
- You have to see this.

658
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:41,552
You're in the field, how do you...
Which way do you look at this ?

659
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,680
- Whose is it ?
- Guess.

660
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,183
- Looks like she's lying face down.
- Who is she ?

661
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,602
- It's not for you.
- What is it ?

662
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,437
No, no, no...

663
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,611
Have you seen Peppe's girlfriend !

664
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:02,365
She's not my girlfriend, do you
think I'd have a girlfriend like that ?

665
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:06,202
- She's doing pilates.
- No, the Sun Salutation.

666
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:13,251
Peppe had no one for years after
his divorce, now girlfriends, lovers...

667
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:17,004
You don't have to explain.
1 ,000 points for Peppe.

668
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:20,341
- Yes, right.
- Hooray for Miss Clementini.

669
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,470
What's that ? A text ?

670
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,140
- Who got a text ?
- You did.

671
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:30,101
- It's mine, here.
- Afrog ring tone ?

672
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,728
Who, me ?

673
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,773
Do you think I'm that stupid ?
The kids must've done it.

674
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:39,402
"How are you ?"
How sweet...

675
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,237
Who's Lucio ?

676
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,740
A co-worker from the legal office.

677
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:47,744
- I don't remember him.
- You were on maternity leave.

678
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,163
He's a nice guy.

679
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:53,291
Why's he asking how you are ?

680
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:57,253
Because today I lost my temper
about that case in Basilicata

681
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,130
that's been dragging on.

682
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,673
He noticed I was a bit...

683
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,509
- And you're not replying ?
- No.

684
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:10,183
I don't understand people
who don't answer texts.

685
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,268
It won't take a second.

686
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:17,190
This person was kind enough
to ask...

687
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:21,569
All you have to say is,
"I'm fine, I'm at home."

688
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,697
- That's right.
- Why ? He's not at home.

689
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,701
- That's right.
- I was just saying...

690
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:33,664
Then write, "I'm fine, thanks.
I'm having dinner with friends."

691
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:37,293
- That's right.
- Why must he say where he is ?

692
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,840
It's just a matter of principle.

693
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,594
We don't have any privacy any more.
Once phone calls started with:

694
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,597
"How are you ?"
Now it's: "Where are you ?"

695
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:53,726
- No, he asked "how are you ?"
- That's my business !

696
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:57,480
Okay ?
Why should I tell you where I am ?

697
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:00,858
Why ?
And why the fuck would you care ?

698
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:05,446
- Why are you taking it out on me ?
- These things are ruining our lives.

699
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:08,115
They're taking our private lives
away from us.

700
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:12,119
And we're allowing them to,
day after day, without realizing it.

701
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,836
- Okay, I won't answer it.
- Good, don't answer it.

702
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:24,257
Guys, this eclipse is having
a bad effect on you.

703
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,717
Rocco, you've got an email.

704
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:31,389
- I've got a text too.
- No, first Rocco's email.

705
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,849
Scared ?

706
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,601
Scared ofwhat ?

707
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,604
Orizzonti Tour.
The house in Salina's confirmed.

708
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:41,524
- Thank goodness !
- You were lucky.

709
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:45,403
Let's read Carlotta's text.

710
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:48,656
No, I want to read one out.

711
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:53,160
I've learnt something I want to...

712
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,663
Siri, read email.

713
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:59,166
You have no new email.

714
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,794
Not even Siri understands you.
What email ?

715
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,297
- It's a message.
- A message.

716
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,425
Siri, read the message.

717
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:15,266
You have a message
from +393462371733.

718
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,768
Dear Mrs. De Rosa,
we'd like to inform you

719
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,187
we have a spot
available in June.

720
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:24,525
During this time
we're offering a 25% discount.

721
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,570
Do not hesitate to call us
for further information.

722
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:31,824
Thank you for contacting us.
La Quiete Home for the Elderly.

723
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:36,329
- Do you want to answer ?
- I don't want to answer.

724
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:39,415
Who sends messages at this hour ?!
They're crazy !

725
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,835
- La Quiete ? Is it a rest home ?
- No...

726
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:47,340
I went there last week with
my friend Rita, her mom's there.

727
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:51,218
It's lovely, I had a look around
and asked for some information.

728
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,846
- That's all.
- That's all ?

729
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,183
You asked for information
at a rest home ?

730
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:02,563
That's like going to a funeral and
asking if there's a tomb available.

731
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,358
It's not a rest home.
it's a five-star facility.

732
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,234
So what ?

733
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,946
- Why didn't you tell me ?
- I forgot.

734
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,366
I didn't even save the number.

735
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,620
I don't believe it.

736
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,498
You want to kick mom out.

737
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:24,710
Don't pass me off as something I'm not.
I'm not kicking anyone out.

738
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,837
- That woman adores you.
- I know.

739
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,632
She helps us out with the kids,
with everything.

740
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,718
- Or am I mistaken ?
- You're not mistaken, but...

741
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,388
But what ?

742
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:39,850
I love her too, you know that.
But ever since she's been with us,

743
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,853
our dynamics have changed.
Admit it.

744
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:48,734
Sure... mom, who sleeps
in a cubicle at the end of the hall,

745
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,405
is to blame for our problems.
Yes, that's possible.

746
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:56,659
Pretend I never said anything.
We don't have problems, it's fine.

747
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:02,415
I'm fond of Cosimo's mom too,
but if she came to live with us...

748
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,292
I'm sorry, darling,
but I couldn't cope.

749
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:08,921
With my mother ? I wouldn't want
to live with her either.

750
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:13,509
Some facilities are so nice
that old folks beg to go there.

751
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,762
- It's like a resort.
- Did she tell you to say that ?

752
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:20,266
Would you live with Carlotta's mom ?

753
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:23,310
- My mother's a widow. Hers isn't.
- Mine isn't.

754
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:29,817
Lele's right... but she can be a pain
in the ass when she wants to be.

755
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:34,572
I got more slaps from your mom
than from my dad.

756
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:38,325
- Obviously not enough.
- Your mom's not bursting with charm.

757
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:43,164
Okay, I'll admit she can be
a bit difficult.

758
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,334
- What time it is ?
- Just after ten.

759
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,587
- Let's go and see the eclipse.
- Yes !

760
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,715
- Leave the phones on the table.
- Can I take mine ? For a photo.

761
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:56,343
- Okay, just you. Not you !
- Come on, the eclipse !

762
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,930
They're well-organized.
As soon as they bury one,

763
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,349
they send out a message
to find a replacement.

764
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:07,104
- No joke, they were fully booked.
- I should open a nursing home.

765
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,816
Open one in the hills.
Capers outside, old folks inside.

766
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,320
It's lovely, though
I still see two of them.

767
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,864
There are two,
one on top of the other.

768
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,702
- Lovely, isn't it ?
- Yes.

769
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:24,622
It won't last much longer,
then it'll disappear.

770
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:29,877
Listen, I'm sorry about before,
I said it without thinking.

771
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:33,964
- I wouldn't want you to be upset.
- I'm not upset.

772
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,888
I wonder why eclipses
fascinate us so much.

773
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:46,894
- The Dark Side of the Moon !
- Great record !

774
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:55,277
Let's take a photo, come over here.

775
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,863
- Who'll take it ?
- I will.

776
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:03,661
- Squeeze together.
- I'll bend down or we won't fit.

777
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,664
Wait, darling, I'll do it. Hold it...

778
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:09,917
- Everyone in ? Smile.
- One...

779
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,253
"Hi".

780
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,299
- What does he want on a Friday night ?
- I don't know.

781
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:18,676
- Who's Ivano ?
- Her ex.

782
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,011
- He's pissed.
- No.

783
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:24,515
- I'm joking.
- Let's take the photo.

784
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:31,814
- Why did you save his number as Ivano ?
- How else ? That's his name.

785
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:34,525
- By his surname.
- Come on, he's her ex !

786
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,569
- Precisely !
- Exes are dangerous.

787
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:39,446
They're like the Japanese,
they never give up.

788
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,407
Especially if they got dumped.

789
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,826
That's right.
Bianca ? Bianca ?

790
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,579
- Who broke it off ?
- Me.

791
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,914
Come on, take this photo.

792
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,333
He's harmless,
but it's the principle...

793
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,918
Smile !

794
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,838
One, two...

795
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:59,466
"I feel like screwing"

796
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:05,181
- Good thing he was harmless.
- What the fuck ?

797
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:08,350
- I can explain.
- It says, "I feel like screwing" !

798
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,687
- It could be predictive text.
- Shut the fuck up.

799
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,856
- Let me explain.
- Go on then.

800
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:18,110
Ivano's in a relationship
with this girl, it's all about sex.

801
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:21,739
Well, it is for her but he's in love,

802
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,575
but won't admit it
and he's suffering like a dog.

803
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:28,078
- That's why he called the vet.
- Well ?

804
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,082
Well ?
Why's he texting you ?

805
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:36,879
I don't know what's so funny.
What's so funny ?

806
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:42,760
- I tell you what, he can explain.
- No, there's really no need.

807
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:47,014
Please, there's nothing to explain.
It's pointless, just stop.

808
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,974
- All right ?
- Quiet everyone.

809
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:57,024
Hey, thanks for calling.
l'm sorry to be a pain, Bianca.

810
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,151
- Did she call you ?
- Yes.

811
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,029
- And ?
- She asked me over.

812
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,032
- Don't go.
- l can't help myself.

813
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:08,994
- She gets to me, l want to go.
- But she'll only hurt you.

814
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,248
- l'm hurting enough as it is.
- It'll be worse ifyou go.

815
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:16,919
- Some help you are !
- At least I'm trying to help.

816
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:20,297
Otherwise don't bother calling,
you know what I think.

817
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:24,051
- What a pain ! Bye.
- Bye... Ivano !

818
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,888
- Don't go there !
- Okay... bye.

819
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:34,144
- Satisfied ?
- How often do you talk ?

820
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:38,190
- Now and then.
- How often is now and then ?

821
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:41,318
- Every time he wants to...
- I get it.

822
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,445
He panics and calls me.

823
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:48,450
Give him Eva's number,
he needs a therapist, not an ex.

824
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,954
- Guys, the meatloaf's ready.
- Unbelievable !

825
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:59,420
- Why didn't you tell me you talk ?
- Because it's not important.

826
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:03,299
- There's nothing to tell.
- You say we should share everything.

827
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,843
Everything that's important
for our relationship.

828
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:10,973
- I think he still wants to screw you.
- And that seems very important.

829
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,309
- Don't be silly !
- Yeah, don't be silly.

830
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:18,230
- I don't talk to my exes.
- No, they'd prefer you dead.

831
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:23,110
If it bothers you, I'll call him
and tell him not to call any more.

832
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:26,238
- Right, you tell him.
- Then Cosimo is happy

833
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:29,742
and you can speak to Ivano in secret.

834
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,369
If I tell Cosimo I won't talk to him,
then I won't.

835
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:36,874
Why shouldn't you talk to him ?
He's a friend, Cosimo should trust you.

836
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,877
I trust her, but I can't stand him.
Alright ?

837
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:46,383
- Doesn't Ivano have a house in Anzio ?
- Yes, that's why she wanted to go.

838
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,011
Yes, of course !

839
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:55,392
- Does he really have a house there ?
- You really are crazy !

840
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:59,897
- I don't even know him !
- I'm not in the mood, Lele.

841
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,399
I can see that.

842
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:06,403
- It's Sofia.
- Answer it.

843
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:13,410
- Hello, darling. Are you okay ?
- Hi, dad. Yes, l'm fine.

844
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:17,414
- Can you talk ?
- Yes, of course. Go ahead.

845
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:21,794
l don't know how to tell you this,
but Gregorio's parents are away.

846
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,923
And he's asked me to go...
to sleep there.

847
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,927
Dad, are you still there ?

848
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:34,181
- And what did you say ?
- l don't know, l want to.

849
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:37,434
But l wasn't expecting it tonight.

850
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,813
lf l don't go, he might be upset.
What shall l do ?

851
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:44,942
Don't go just because he'd be upset.
That can't be the only reason.

852
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:47,194
Of course it's not...

853
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:51,532
And don't expect me
to be enthusiastic about it.

854
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,325
Come on, dad...

855
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:58,330
But there is something
I want to say.

856
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:04,420
This is an important moment,
something you'll remember all your life.

857
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:10,467
It's notjust something
to tell your friends tomorrow.

858
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,554
Ifyou think that later...

859
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:18,350
whenever you look back on it,
it'll make you smile...

860
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:22,604
then go ahead.

861
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:26,108
But ifyou don't feel like it,
ifyou're not sure,

862
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,360
then forget about it.

863
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,114
Because you have plenty of time.

864
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,243
- Do you know what ?
- What ?

865
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:39,246
- Never mind.
- No, tell me.

866
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:43,000
You embarrassed me today
when you gave me those condoms.

867
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:45,502
l didn't know where to look.

868
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:48,589
I didn't tell you to use them.

869
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:53,093
Why then ? l think you knew,
you have a sixth sense.

870
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:56,263
You've never done it before.
Anyway...

871
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:00,142
lf l do go to Gregorio's,
tell mom l'm at Chicca's.

872
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:03,395
- Why don't you tell her ?
- What ?

873
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:05,522
- The truth.
- Are you crazy ?

874
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,901
- I've told you to talk to her.
- You know what she's like.

875
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,987
She never listens, just gets angry.

876
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:16,533
- Have a little bit of patience.
- A lot of patience.

877
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,369
Okay, a lot of patience.

878
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:23,415
But I think it's worth a try.
Try it.

879
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:27,044
You're too in love with mom
to see what a bitch she is.

880
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:31,006
- Okay, l have to go. Thanks.
- Sofia...

881
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,190
You did really well.

882
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:55,447
The therapy must be working.

883
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:58,450
Bianca...

884
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:02,287
- Did you tell her ?
- No.

885
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,084
- You told her.
- Okay, but I only told her.

886
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:12,464
- And I only told Peppe.
- And I... Only Lele.

887
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:16,593
- And Lele kept it to himself.
- She's my wife...

888
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:19,304
She's my best friend.

889
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:25,602
- Sorry...
- Don't be.

890
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:30,607
He's seeing a therapist,
not a whore ! Come on !

891
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,442
Right...

892
00:59:33,486 --> 00:59:35,195
There's the frog again.

893
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:39,616
- Lucio wants you to answer him.
- Why's he insisting ?

894
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:43,120
Answer him, then he might stop.

895
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,248
Perhaps I'd better,
or he won't leave me alone.

896
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,336
"I'm having dinner with friends,
we'll talk tomorrow."

897
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,633
Let's see if he sends another...

898
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,636
"We've decided
to reveal our private business."

899
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,597
No, we can't...

900
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:09,021
He wrote "jerk".

901
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:12,149
- Damn.
- How dare he ?

902
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:15,402
You'll have to explain this.

903
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,280
- Explain what ?
- You don'tjust call someone a jerk.

904
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:21,283
In fact he's an oaf,
he's bad-mannered.

905
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:24,369
Would this oaf
happened to be named Lucia ?

906
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:28,790
- Don't be silly !
- Such a cheeky co-worker.

907
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:33,670
He's calling you.
Answer it, then we'll know more.

908
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,423
We'll find out why he's so angry.

909
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:38,550
Come on.

910
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:43,263
- Okay, on speaker, right ?
- Yes.

911
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,440
- Hello ?
- Why do you sound so glum ?

912
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:56,193
l thought you said you had a fever ?

913
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,445
Then why did you go out ?

914
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:01,823
Have you nothing to say ?

915
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:05,077
You're a jerk. You know what ?

916
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,663
You can't make a decision,

917
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:10,207
you don't know what you want in life.

918
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,794
You don't even know if you like
men or women.

919
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,712
So fuck off !

920
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:29,601
This guy's off his rocker...

921
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:34,231
I would never have thought it. But...

922
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:44,825
You must be crazy !

923
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,494
You don't think I'm...

924
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:52,124
No, he's a co-worker who's gay...

925
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:56,253
and he's obsessed with me, that's all.

926
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:06,513
Stop messing around, okay.
Carlotta ?

927
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:10,392
- Carlotta, no messing around.
- Why didn't you tell me ?

928
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:15,647
He's a co-worker...
Rocco, you tell her.

929
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:19,609
- Cosimo, come on !
- He's a co-worker who...

930
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,655
- He's a co-worker.
- You see ?

931
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:26,992
Have you been with him ?

932
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,412
- What ?
- Have you been with him ? Simple.

933
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:35,125
Have I been with who ?
He's a co-worker who's in love with me

934
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,669
and he's convinced
I'm in love with him.

935
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:40,547
Yes, because fags
think everyone else is a fag.

936
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:43,675
- An elegant analysis.
- Sorry, it came out all wrong, but...

937
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:46,553
The concept is the same.

938
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,306
- What are you talking about ?
- Rocco's right, sort of.

939
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:53,310
I want to know ifyou've been
with this Lucio. Yes or no ?

940
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:57,439
Carlotta... Geez !
Come on !

941
01:02:57,648 --> 01:03:02,319
We've been together for 10 years.
We have two wonderful children.

942
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:05,322
- You should know me.
- Maybe not well enough.

943
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:08,700
What do you mean ?
Say something to her !

944
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,916
Carlotta, look at me.
Darling, look at me.

945
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:21,463
Can you imagine me with a man ?
Like this, eyes straight ahead ?

946
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:24,341
Can you imagine me like that ?
Can you ?

947
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:30,472
Though there's no harm in that.
I'm just saying that...

948
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,600
because I have other tastes,
and you know that.

949
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:35,602
Carlotta...

950
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,188
I promise you, between me and...

951
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:40,607
- Lucio.
- Lucio... nothing's ever happened.

952
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:43,360
I swear.

953
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:07,467
It's Lucio.

954
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,887
He says he misses your kisses.

955
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:30,991
Is he a fag then ?

956
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:37,539
- Guys, how can I explain...
- There's nothing to explain.

957
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,794
Don't you start now.
What's wrong ?

958
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:48,049
What's wrong ? Nothing.
I'm fine. Are you ?

959
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,428
Yes, I'm fine.

960
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,639
- Fine then.
- Wait, let him talk.

961
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:57,809
Talk ? He hasn't said anything
for 20 years.

962
01:04:58,185 --> 01:05:00,645
What was I supposed to tell you ?

963
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:03,064
What were you supposed
to tell me ?

964
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:06,693
We've been friends since childhood,
tell me who you are.

965
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:09,821
He's the same person
you've always confided in,

966
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,324
and shared everything with.

967
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:15,702
I wouldn't say everything, Peppe.

968
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:18,955
He omitted a small detail.

969
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:23,084
And perhaps he should've told me.

970
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,464
I should have told you ?

971
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:32,469
- Why ?
- We've slept together.

972
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:36,681
Took a shower together.
I want to know if my best friend's a fag.

973
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:40,977
I might decide it's fine by me,
but I want to know, damn it !

974
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:46,733
"I might decide it's fine by me" ?

975
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,612
Do you hear yourself ?

976
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:52,864
Do you realize what you said ?

977
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:56,868
Do you realize
what you didn't say ?

978
01:05:56,994 --> 01:06:00,956
- But what's the problem ?
- I'm asking him, I want to know.

979
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:03,375
Let me get this straight.

980
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:08,380
Does it bother you that I'm a fag,
orjust that I didn't tell you ?

981
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:14,386
- You're going too far, Cosimo.
- Okay...

982
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:18,974
Ifyou find it normal,
then it's all in my head.

983
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:22,519
Okay ? It's all good.

984
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:25,772
I'm exaggerating.
I was wrong. Forgive me.

985
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:30,777
No, I'm the one who's wrong.

986
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:34,990
I was wrong to think
we were friends.

987
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:41,413
Better not drink from the bottle...

988
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:43,873
Fuck off, Rocco !

989
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:54,926
He's not cheating on you
with another woman,

990
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,929
so he's not questioning
his relationship with you.

991
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:00,807
He's questioning himself.

992
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:03,810
He told you lies
because it was inevitable,

993
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:06,563
but you must decide ifyou want him,

994
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:10,442
and ifyou can forgive him or not,
that's the real problem.

995
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:15,196
The real problem is that
Lucio's missing my husband's kisses.

996
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:30,712
- When did this affair start ?
- What affair ? This is absurd.

997
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:35,175
Not really. You haven't
touched me in months.

998
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,970
I was sure you had someone else,
maybe a whore like Peppe's.

999
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:41,473
It would all make sense.

1000
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:47,854
- It'd make sense ?
- How long has it been going on ?

1001
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,981
Lele, how long ?

1002
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:52,859
How long has it been going on ?

1003
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:56,071
Not long.

1004
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:17,133
- Can I say something ?
- No.

1005
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,764
How many ?

1006
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:26,643
- How many what ?
- How many before him ?

1007
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,520
None.

1008
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:31,856
Lucio's the only one.

1009
01:08:36,153 --> 01:08:37,779
All right...

1010
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:40,156
Thanks for dinner.

1011
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:47,413
- Let's go, we'll talk at home.
- In front of the kids ?

1012
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:51,167
"Kids, we have something to tell you.
Daddy's a fag !

1013
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:54,671
But don't tell your teacher,
or you'll show daddy up

1014
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,132
when he picks you up from school."

1015
01:08:57,258 --> 01:09:00,677
- Have you finished ?
- Why don't you say something ?

1016
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:03,179
They're your friends,
they want to know.

1017
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,889
Let's go home.

1018
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:07,267
You go home.

1019
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,577
It's yours.

1020
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,130
Hello, yes ?

1021
01:10:19,256 --> 01:10:21,382
Hi, Cosimo, at last !

1022
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:24,510
You're hard to get a hold of.

1023
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:27,096
Don't you check your messages ?

1024
01:10:27,264 --> 01:10:30,141
l've left loads
over the last two weeks.

1025
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:34,229
- I know, Maurizio...
- l've called you a hundred times.

1026
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:39,025
- I know, you're right.
- Just tell me if she liked the ring.

1027
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:43,655
Yes, she liked it.
Sorry, now's not a good time.

1028
01:10:44,156 --> 01:10:48,159
Well did she like the earrings ?

1029
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:51,537
Sorry, but I really have to go.
I'm tied up. Bye.

1030
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:12,684
Did who like the earrings ?

1031
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:17,188
- You, they were for you.
- For me ?

1032
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:19,399
- Yes...
- I don't wear earrings.

1033
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:24,195
- I don't even have pierced ears.
- Well, I got them...

1034
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:27,699
- You're telling lies.
- No, it's not a lie.

1035
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:32,412
Have I ever lied to you ?
Enough of this game, it's bad for us.

1036
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:36,457
- Too many misunderstandings now.
- They were for Ginevra.

1037
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:39,585
Ginevra ?
What are you talking about ?

1038
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:42,338
Tell me you're not screwing Ginevra.

1039
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:44,424
Screwing Ginevra ?
What do you mean ?

1040
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:47,427
Who were those fucking
earrings for then ?

1041
01:11:56,603 --> 01:11:58,354
Answer it.

1042
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:02,358
- It's Marika, come on.
- Talk to Marika.

1043
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:06,237
It's a work thing...

1044
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,615
Bianca, give me that phone.

1045
01:12:13,203 --> 01:12:14,620
Give me that phone.

1046
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:17,623
Give me that fucking phone !

1047
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:24,630
Hello, sweetie ?
Sorry for calling so late, Cosimo...

1048
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:28,760
l panicked. l did the test
and there are two lines on it.

1049
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:33,639
l think it's positive.
l think l'm pregnant. Am l ?

1050
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:36,851
Am l pregnant ? l can't tell,
do two lines mean positive ?

1051
01:12:36,977 --> 01:12:40,646
Cosimo, can you hear me ?
Are you there ?

1052
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,524
Can you hear me, sweetie ?

1053
01:12:57,664 --> 01:12:59,415
Fuck !

1054
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,632
Bianca !

1055
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:14,180
Bianca.

1056
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,937
Open this door.
Open it, please !

1057
01:13:38,038 --> 01:13:40,081
You're disgusting.

1058
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,061
Eva !

1059
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:24,000
What's wrong ?

1060
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:25,877
Nothing.

1061
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:30,006
- Are you sure ?
- Yes.

1062
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:51,027
What the...

1063
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:53,029
What the fuck !

1064
01:14:54,907 --> 01:15:00,036
We've onlyjust gotten married,
we screw every day, we're happy...

1065
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:02,538
Will you tell me why ?

1066
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:06,501
I don't know.
Bianca, I really don't know.

1067
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:11,547
I didn't even want to get married.

1068
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:16,761
I never believed in marriage.
Marriage makes me sad and anxious.

1069
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:19,931
I didn't want a child, either.

1070
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:24,060
What do I know
about bringing kids up ?

1071
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:28,064
I just wanted to be free.

1072
01:15:29,816 --> 01:15:32,944
Then that asshole came along
and turned my life upside-down.

1073
01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:37,573
He made me believe we could
be happy and I trusted him, but...

1074
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:41,702
How the fuck does
Marika fit in with this ?

1075
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:48,084
- How the fuck does she fit in ?
- Go away !

1076
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,211
- Don't open it.
- Go away !

1077
01:15:51,171 --> 01:15:53,214
Carlotta, it's me, open the door.

1078
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:57,718
Will you open the door ?

1079
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:24,579
It doesn't mean anything, you know.

1080
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:27,623
He's just a guy on Facebook.

1081
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:30,585
Look at me !
I don't even know him.

1082
01:16:31,878 --> 01:16:34,755
A guy you don't know asks
ifyou're wearing panties ?

1083
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:38,884
It's a game. But we've never met.
We just write to each other.

1084
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:42,597
- Call him.
- What ?

1085
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,015
Call him !

1086
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:47,768
I can't, I've never spoken to him.
He's got a family.

1087
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:51,606
- Really ? You have a family too.
- Come on...

1088
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:53,733
- Call him !
- We only write...

1089
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,611
- If it's a game, call him.
- Please, don't call him !

1090
01:16:56,778 --> 01:17:00,781
- What would I say to him ?
- Let's see how well you know him.

1091
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,161
Play the game.

1092
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:22,637
Hello ?
Carlotta, is that you ?

1093
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,055
Hi.

1094
01:17:24,264 --> 01:17:27,933
- Sorry, was l wrong to write tonight ?
- No, it's okay.

1095
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:31,187
What a surprise !
How come you're calling ?

1096
01:17:31,938 --> 01:17:35,024
- I was curious to hear your voice.
- l'm glad you did.

1097
01:17:36,401 --> 01:17:38,694
I'd like to meet up too.

1098
01:17:40,197 --> 01:17:42,782
But we agreed not to.

1099
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:45,660
Or rather, you didn't want to.

1100
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:48,329
You're right, yes.
I did say that.

1101
01:17:48,705 --> 01:17:53,959
lf you've changed your mind,
we could meet, l'd like to.

1102
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:56,671
- Sorry, I have to go now.
- Carlotta, wait.

1103
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:59,924
- What ?
- You've got a nice voice.

1104
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:03,052
- lt's not how l imagined it.
- Bye.

1105
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:06,555
You see...

1106
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,851
Are you wearing panties or not ?

1107
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:13,562
Just curious.

1108
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:20,111
We're all very curious,
we'd like to know.

1109
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,075
- Are you ?
- Stop it.

1110
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:29,995
- It's an easy question, tell me.
- Please, just stop it.

1111
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:32,957
- Stop it, please !
- Let me see.

1112
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,750
Stop it !

1113
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:43,008
- I'm going home.
- Tell the kids about this too.

1114
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:46,387
Tell them their mother
doesn't wear panties.

1115
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:52,226
All this fuss over panties !
Here you go.

1116
01:18:52,352 --> 01:18:54,478
- I'm not wearing any, happy ?
- Hey...

1117
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:57,356
- What are you doing ?
- Leave me alone.

1118
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:00,776
After what I've heard tonight,
this is nothing.

1119
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:06,115
I'll tell you a secret you won't find
on my phone, or Lele's.

1120
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:08,409
- Don't do this.
- Quiet, let me finish.

1121
01:19:08,785 --> 01:19:11,036
I was driving that night, not Lele.

1122
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:16,292
He took the blame but I was driving.
I was drunk, I'd have ended up in jail.

1123
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:20,045
But what would we have done
with the kids ?

1124
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:24,759
We chose...
what is it we always say ?

1125
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:26,427
The lesser of two evils.

1126
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:32,141
But a man died, I wouldn't
call that the "lesser of two evils".

1127
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:40,900
- Okay, that's enough now.
- Enough what, Lele ?

1128
01:19:41,067 --> 01:19:44,945
You do realize we haven't discussed
it since, like it never happened ?

1129
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:48,449
The only thing that's kept us
together was my guilt.

1130
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:52,077
The guilt you've made me feel
over the years.

1131
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,959
Why haven't we split up ?

1132
01:20:05,091 --> 01:20:08,052
People should learn
how to split up.

1133
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:19,480
If only you'd told me
you were a fag !

1134
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,233
It would've made things easier.

1135
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:38,874
Actually, I'm the one who's the fag.

1136
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:54,139
Fag !

1137
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:57,226
Did I say it right ?

1138
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:03,524
When you say it, you always
articulate it like this... fag !

1139
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:08,028
You pronounce it with two Fs
and a nice hard G.

1140
01:21:08,488 --> 01:21:10,614
Did I say it right ?

1141
01:21:11,491 --> 01:21:13,993
Did I say it right, or not ?

1142
01:21:18,164 --> 01:21:22,167
- Not such a good idea, was it ?
- I'd say not.

1143
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:27,506
- Why didn't you tell us before ?
- Why didn't I tell you before ?

1144
01:21:27,924 --> 01:21:30,426
Because I didn't know before.

1145
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:35,431
- Then when I realized...
- I'll tell you why he didn't tell us.

1146
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:40,436
Because I was a fag for two hours,
and that was long enough.

1147
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:45,024
We're all open-minded here, right ?

1148
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:49,153
We all like to have a fag for a friend.

1149
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:52,573
And now we've got one too.

1150
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,953
- And it seems we took it very well.
- Fuck off !

1151
01:21:58,079 --> 01:21:59,455
There, you see ?

1152
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:04,084
You think they didn't renew
my contract because I'd put weight on ?

1153
01:22:04,961 --> 01:22:07,171
- Was it because you're gay ?
- Rocco, for God's sake.

1154
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:09,214
Not gay ! It doesn't befit you.

1155
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:13,344
Carry on saying "fag" !
It comes more naturally.

1156
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:16,055
Peppe, why don't you sue
the school ?

1157
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:19,600
Sue them ?
I can't even tell you I'm gay...

1158
01:22:19,976 --> 01:22:23,938
never mind a court of people,
a judge, the lawyers...

1159
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:27,483
my relatives...

1160
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:34,990
I liked this game, it was a bit like
the story ofthe serial killer,

1161
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:38,243
I wanted to be unmasked too.

1162
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:40,204
But not like this though.

1163
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:50,589
At least you can introduce us
to Lucio now.

1164
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:53,634
I really don't think so, Rocco.

1165
01:22:54,594 --> 01:22:56,637
Because tonight...

1166
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,974
you're the ones
who came out, not me.

1167
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:05,270
No...

1168
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:08,023
I won't introduce you.

1169
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:11,527
Not because
I'm scared ofyour wisecracks,

1170
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:14,363
I've heard enough of those.

1171
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:19,493
But because I know he'd be hurt
at the first weird glance.

1172
01:23:20,036 --> 01:23:23,247
And I don't want him to be hurt,
I want to protect him.

1173
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:27,501
Because ifyou love someone,
you protect them, from everything.

1174
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:30,921
From this...

1175
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:37,553
and all this.

1176
01:23:57,032 --> 01:24:00,951
Bianca. Come on, open this door.

1177
01:24:03,163 --> 01:24:05,205
That's enough, open this door.

1178
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:09,460
She's locked herself in.

1179
01:24:09,919 --> 01:24:11,420
Bianca !

1180
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:16,425
Open the door !

1181
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:19,720
- Get her out of there !
- How ?

1182
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:21,930
- Break it down !
- Let's try.

1183
01:24:23,850 --> 01:24:26,435
- Break the door down.
- Bianca !

1184
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:29,980
- Open this door !
- Get out of the way !

1185
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,011
Your mother called.

1186
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:03,597
I told her you're going to be a father.

1187
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:07,726
She was very happy.
She congratulated me.

1188
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:25,119
You're right not to introduce
Lucio to them. Keep him to yourself.

1189
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:51,061
Go on.

1190
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:52,938
Go, go on !

1191
01:27:22,111 --> 01:27:24,029
Look how beautiful it is !

1192
01:27:25,531 --> 01:27:27,366
It's full again.

1193
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:29,618
It's amazing !

1194
01:27:32,664 --> 01:27:35,916
That's enough !
You're always at it !

1195
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:39,169
- Hurry up, darling, it's cold.
- I'm on my way.

1196
01:27:39,295 --> 01:27:40,796
Bye, Peppe.

1197
01:27:41,005 --> 01:27:43,257
- Bye, Lele.
- I'll call you.

1198
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:49,179
Are we on for soccer tomorrow ?

1199
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:53,267
- I haven't heard from anyone.
- It's probably been called off.

1200
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:56,311
- Call me if there's a game.
- Of course.

1201
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:58,689
- Come on !
- I'm coming.

1202
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:03,068
Peppe,
next time we want to meet Lucilla.

1203
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:06,280
Okay, as soon as she's feeling better.
Bye, good night.

1204
01:28:07,323 --> 01:28:11,827
- Why didn't you want to play the game ?
- I didn't like the idea.

1205
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:16,415
No, you insisted on not playing.
Got something to hide ?

1206
01:28:19,335 --> 01:28:20,585
No.

1207
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:22,713
Why then ?

1208
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:26,925
Because we're breakable... all of us,

1209
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:29,177
some more than others.

1210
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:41,732
You're right, this has become our
black box, it's got everything inside.

1211
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:43,317
Perhaps too much.

1212
01:28:44,193 --> 01:28:46,486
And it's wrong
to play around with it.

1213
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:54,369
But I have nothing to hide.

1214
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:57,247
You can do whatever
you want with it.

1215
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:02,377
You can take a look.
There's no passcode.

1216
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:07,341
Nice earrings, are they new ?

1217
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:10,010
Yes.

1218
01:29:18,227 --> 01:29:20,103
Marika: Call me, it's urgent !

1219
01:29:20,271 --> 01:29:22,731
Eva: I wanted you so bad tonight...

1220
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:26,109
- Who are you texting ?
- Eva and Rocco.

1221
01:29:26,277 --> 01:29:29,029
- To thank them for tonight.
- Good.

1222
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:33,158
- We had a good time, right ?
- Yes.

1223
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:36,036
"That makes two of us"

1224
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:44,795
- It's Marika, what a pain !
- For a shift change, don't answer it.

1225
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:47,130
I'm not going to.

1226
01:29:48,007 --> 01:29:50,550
Listen... no more biodynamic wine.

1227
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:54,304
I bought six bottles of it.

1228
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:56,181
Figures !

1229
01:31:03,749 --> 01:31:09,004
PERFECT STRANGERS
