1
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,600
Bingo!

2
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,650
(chimps screeching)

3
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,780
Fucking hell.

4
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,520
(screech)

5
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,000
Fucking hell.

6
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,820
- Oh, God...
- Keep your shit together.

7
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,950
lf you wanna get 'em out of here.

8
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,470
- l can pop these, no problem.
- So get to it!

9
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,170
Security, we have a break-in. Get the...

10
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,470
l know who you are.
l know what you think...

11
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,390
lf you don't wanna get hurt,
keep your mouth shut and don't move.

12
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,730
The chimps are infected. They're highly
contagious. They've been given an inhibitor.

13
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,300
- lnfected with what?
- To cure, you must first understand.

14
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,340
lnfected with what?

15
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,170
Rage.

16
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,040
- What is he talking about?
- Get the cages open.

17
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,470
No! No! No!

18
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,470
Listen, you sick bastard,
we're taking your torture victims with us.

19
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,130
We'll get you out of here.

20
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,910
The animals are contagious. The infection
is in their blood and saliva. One bite...

21
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,470
Stop... Stop! You've no idea!

22
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,950
(screaming)

23
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,870
Get it off! Help me!

24
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,390
Get it off! Get it off!

25
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,210
- What's the matter with her?
- You have to kill her!

26
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,520
(screams) Oh, my God!

27
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,080
- What's the matter with her?
- We have to kill her now!

28
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,170
Oh, God...

29
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,730
(screaming)

30
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
(sharp intake of breath)

31
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,650
Hello?

32
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,040
(coughs)

33
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,560
Hello?

34
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,730
(louder) Hello!

35
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,820
(belches)

36
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,950
Hello?

37
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,780
Hello!

38
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,780
(alarm)

39
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,130
Hello?

40
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,210
Hello?

41
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,520
(noises from behind door)

42
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,040
(gasping and retching)

43
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,650
Father?

44
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,130
Father, are you OK?

45
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,170
Oh, shouldn't have done that.

46
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,820
Shouldn't have done that.

47
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,130
Shit!

48
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,000
(man) Over here!

49
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,210
- Over here!
- Come on!

50
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,170
Go, go, go!

51
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,470
Keep going!

52
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,430
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just shut up!

53
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,170
- Covered everything.
- Who are those people?

54
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,730
Let's go! Let's go!

55
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,040
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just move!

56
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,870
Come on!

57
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,780
Man walks into a bar with a giraffe.
They each get pissed.

58
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,870
The giraffe falls over.

59
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:09,170
The man goes to leave and the barman says
''Oi! You can't leave that lying there.''

60
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,300
He says ''No, it's not a lion. lt's a giraffe''.

61
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,820
He's completely humourless.

62
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,820
You two should get on like a house on fire.

63
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,390
So who are you?

64
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,520
You're from the hospital.

65
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,130
- Are you a doctor?
- He's not a doctor. He's a patient.

66
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,520
l'm a bicycle courier.

67
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:48,130
l was riding a package from Farringdon to
Shaftesbury Avenue and a car cut across me.

68
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,950
Then l wake up today in hospital.
l wake up and l'm...

69
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,950
l'm hallucinating or l'm...

70
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,080
What's your name?

71
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,260
Jim.

72
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,600
l'm Mark. This is Selena.

73
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,690
OK, Jim.

74
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,030
l've got some bad news.

75
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:24,380
lt started as rioting, and right from
the beginning you knew this was different.

76
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,640
Because it was happening
in small villages, market towns.

77
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,250
And then it wasn't on the TV any more.

78
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:37,070
lt was in the street outside.
lt was coming through your windows.

79
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,990
lt was a virus.

80
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,860
An infection.

81
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,770
You didn't need a doctor to tell you that.

82
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,290
lt was the blood.

83
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,900
There was something in the blood.

84
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:55,330
By the time they tried to evacuate
the cities, it was already too late.

85
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,330
The infection was everywhere.

86
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,900
The army blockades were overrun.

87
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,160
And that's when the exodus started.

88
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,290
The day before broadcasting stopped,

89
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,030
there were reports of lnfection
in Paris and New York.

90
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,330
We didn't hear anything more after that.

91
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:24,250
- What's the government doing?
- There's no government.

92
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,810
Of course there's a government!

93
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,940
There's always a government.
They're in a bunker or a plane...

94
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:35,330
No, there's no government,
no police, no army.

95
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,900
No TV, no radio, no electricity.

96
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:44,680
You're the first uninfected person
we've seen in six days.

97
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,600
Where's your family?

98
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,550
They're dead. Like Selena's.

99
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,770
Yours will be dead too.

100
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,070
Look, l have to find them.
They live in Deptford. l can walk it. OK?

101
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,730
You'll go and come back, yeah?

102
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,940
- You won't.
- Yes!

103
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,030
No one ever comes back.

104
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,640
So lesson one.

105
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,940
You never go anywhere alone
unless you've got no choice.

106
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,330
Lesson two.

107
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,510
Only travel during daylight.
Unless you've got no choice.

108
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,600
We'll take you tomorrow.

109
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,290
We'll all go and find
your dead parents together, OK?

110
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,770
Eat.

111
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,120
lf you want her to slow down,
you'll have to say.

112
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,680
- lf there's anyone...
- l understand.

113
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,860
- Anyone...
- l understand!

114
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,510
OK.

115
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,860
(sniffs)

116
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,640
Jim...

117
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,810
Wait!

118
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,420
They died peacefully.
You should be grateful.

119
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,900
l'm not grateful.

120
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,160
My...

121
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:00,380
parents and my sister,
we went to Paddington Station,

122
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:08,330
hoping maybe we could get on a plane,
maybe we could buy our way onto a plane.

123
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,330
l remember my dad had all this cash,

124
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:14,770
even though cash was completely useless.

125
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,420
About 20,000 other people had the same idea.

126
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,160
Crowd was surging.

127
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,290
l lost my grip on my sister's hand.

128
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,810
l remember the ground was soft.

129
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:38,160
l looked down
and l was standing on all these people.

130
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,200
Like a carpet. People who had fallen and...

131
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:46,250
Somewhere in the crowd
there were lnfected. lt spread fast.

132
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,680
No one could run.
All you could do was climb.

133
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,380
Climb over more people.
So l did that. l climbed.

134
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,810
And l got up on top of this kiosk.

135
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,070
Looking down, you couldn't tell
which faces were infected and which weren't.

136
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,030
Then l saw my dad.
Not my mum or my sister.

137
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,120
My dad.

138
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,470
His face...

139
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,070
Selena's right.
You should be grateful.

140
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,290
We don't have time to get back to the shop
before dark. We should stay here tonight.

141
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,810
My room's up at the top.
You two can have that.

142
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,250
No, we'll all sleep in the same room. lt's safer.

143
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,070
(radio)

144
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,600
Jim.

145
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,330
- You're back.
- Yeah.

146
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,810
- How was it?
- Fine.

147
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,200
Give me a drink of that, will ya?

148
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,330
- lt's empty.
- Ha!

149
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,990
Here.

150
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,160
l'll start working on them, then.

151
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,770
Mark! Mark!

152
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,730
Selena! Help!

153
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,120
(Selena) lt's clear.

154
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,550
- That's Mr Bridges.
- Were you bitten?

155
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,860
And his daughter. From four doors down.

156
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,030
- Were you bitten?
- No.

157
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,030
Did any of the blood get in your mouth?

158
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,940
No.

159
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,810
Mark?

160
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,940
Wait...

161
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,330
(Mark screams)

162
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:53,030
Get that cleaned off.

163
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,990
Do you have any clothes here?

164
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,990
Um... l... Yes.

165
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:03,730
Then get them and get dressed.
We have to leave now.

166
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:07,470
More lnfected will be coming.
They always do.

167
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,250
(Jim) How did you know?
How did you know he was infected?

168
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:43,250
- The blood.
- There was blood on me. lt was on you.

169
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:48,730
l didn't know he was infected.
He knew. l could see it in his face.

170
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:53,200
lf someone gets infected,
you've about 20 seconds to kill them.

171
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:58,420
lt might be your brother, your sister
or your oldest friend. lt makes no difference.

172
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:03,940
Just so you know where you stand,
if it happens to you, l'll do it in a heartbeat.

173
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:08,250
He was full of plans.
Have you got any plans, Jim?

174
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:12,770
Do you want us to find a cure and
save the world orjust fall in love and fuck?

175
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,380
Plans are pointless.

176
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:18,030
Staying alive's as good as it gets.

177
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,290
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

178
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,470
What's that?

179
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,640
Let's go.

180
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,860
What is it about tower blocks
and shopping trolleys?

181
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,030
Stop talking. lt's a long way up.

182
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:35,070
(Selena) Do you need a break?

183
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,290
- You?
- No.

184
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,030
Now l do need a break.

185
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,330
What's up?

186
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,420
Nothin'.

187
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,160
l got a headache.

188
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,730
- Bad?
- Pretty bad.

189
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:08,120
- Why didn't you say something before?
- l didn't think you'd give a shit.

190
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:13,600
You've got no fat on you
and all you've had to eat is sugar.

191
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,770
So you're crashing.

192
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,120
There isn't a lot we can do about that

193
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,290
except pump you full of painkillers
and give you more sugar. As for sugar,

194
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,680
Pepsi or Lilt?

195
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,900
Do you have any Tango?

196
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:32,030
Actually,
l did have a can of Tango somewhere.

197
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,160
(screech)

198
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,510
Quiet! That's an lnfected.

199
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,680
Oh no, they're in. Move!

200
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:53,330
Wait up, Selena!

201
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,250
Wait for me, please!

202
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,470
Please, Selena! Please!

203
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,860
- Wait for me!
- Come on!

204
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,940
- Run!
- Wait!

205
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,290
Please! For fuck's sake!

206
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,120
- Selena!
- (screams)

207
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:14,200
Down the corridor. Flat 157. Move!

208
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,380
Thank you. Thank you.

209
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,900
Open the door!

210
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,070
Open the door!

211
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,250
- Open up!
- Where's Dad?

212
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,810
What?

213
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,420
- Open the fucking door!
- Where's Dad?

214
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,770
Let them in, Hannah. Let them inside.

215
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,990
Go in. Go in!

216
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,640
( ''Frosty the Snowman'")

217
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,470
So, l'm Frank, anyway.

218
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,330
Jim.

219
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,250
- Selena.
- Selena. Good to meet you.

220
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,640
This is my daughter Hannah.

221
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,990
Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.

222
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,470
Come on.

223
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:42,200
So...

224
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:44,200
This is great. Just great.

225
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,810
Calls for a celebration, l'd say.

226
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,940
Why don't you all sit down and...

227
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,990
Hannah, what have we got to offer?

228
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,550
We've got Mum's creme de menthe.

229
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,380
Great. Creme de menthe.

230
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:03,160
Oh, yeah. Look, sit, please.

231
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,730
Get comfortable.

232
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:11,550
- (Frank) Where are the bloody glasses?
- Middle cupboard.

233
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,510
Nah, the good ones. lt's a celebration.

234
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,070
Top cupboard.

235
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,900
So this is your place?

236
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,900
lt's nice.

237
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,160
There.

238
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:40,380
l know it isn't much but, well, cheers.

239
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,200
Cheers.

240
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,030
(groans)

241
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,770
You OK in there, Jim?

242
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,070
Yeah.

243
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,770
Sorry we couldn't spare the water.
Same with the toilet. The flush doesn't work.

244
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,680
You'll have to use the bucket.

245
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,860
Have to empty it each morning.

246
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,600
Just chuck it over the balcony.
No mod cons here.

247
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,380
lt's fine.

248
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,600
Listen, it's late. We're gonna turn in.

249
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,640
We have a spare room.

250
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,990
ln there.

251
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,030
Are you and Selena...?

252
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,120
No. No, no, no.

253
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,860
Um...

254
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,330
l'll take the living room. lt's fine.

255
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,290
Right.

256
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,250
No, l mean, yeah.

257
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,290
So, um...

258
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:04,330
- Goodnight, then.
- Yeah. Goodnight, Frank.

259
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,510
Very spruce.

260
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,680
- Very shredded.
- Yeah.

261
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:32,730
- So what do you make of them?
- Well, they're desperate.

262
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,680
Probably need us more than we need them.

263
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,380
l think they're good people.

264
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,200
- Good people?
- Yeah.

265
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:52,640
You should be more concerned about
whether they're gonna slow you down.

266
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:56,510
- Because if they slowed you down...
- l'd leave them behind.

267
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,510
- ln a heartbeat.
- Yeah.

268
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,860
l wouldn't.

269
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:04,510
Then you're gonna wind up
getting yourself killed.

270
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,330
l'm gonna get some sleep.

271
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,730
Selena...

272
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,810
You think l don't get it, but l do get it.

273
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,680
And l know l'd be dead already
if l hadn't met you.

274
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,770
Sure.

275
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,420
No, look...

276
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,900
l mean, thank you.

277
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,250
And l mean, sure.

278
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:46,120
Goodnight, Jim.

279
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,290
Goodnight.

280
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,940
We lost water pressure three weeks ago.

281
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:08,160
l thought we'd be OK with the water
from the other flats. Cisterns and tanks.

282
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:11,470
But it vanishes so quick
you wouldn't believe.

283
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,470
You drink it,

284
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,330
it evaporates,

285
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,510
turns stagnant.

286
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,990
They're all empty.

287
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,860
Hasn't rained in ten days.

288
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:32,200
You can set up a plastic sheet
to catch dew and condensation.

289
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:36,030
Saw it on TV once, but l can't make it work.

290
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,470
You'd never think it.

291
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,330
Needing rain so badly.

292
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:47,420
Not in fucking England!

293
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:55,200
Jim, we're not going to be able to stay here.

294
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,900
- There's been no broadcasts for weeks.
- Just listen.

295
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:12,550
(man on radio) Salvation is here.
The answer to lnfection is here.

296
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,640
if you can hear this, you're not alone.

297
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:20,250
There are others like you.
There are other survivors.

298
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,510
We are soldiers and we are armed.

299
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,900
Oh, my God. Soldiers.

300
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:30,550
- Quiet. There's more.
- Our location is the 42nd blockade, M602,

301
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,070
27 miles northeast of Manchester.

302
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,070
- You must find us. Salvation is...
- Now itjust repeats.

303
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,550
- lt's a recording?
- Yeah, it's a recording.

304
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,550
But this is where it's telling us to go.

305
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,770
Just there.

306
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:52,070
The way things are, we might need
two or three days to get up there.

307
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,900
''We''?

308
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:04,070
Sound carries in this flat. Me and Hannah
do need you more than you need us.

309
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,290
- Look, l didn't...
- No, it's OK. lt's the truth.

310
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,900
l can't leave the block if it's the two of us.

311
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:13,940
Something might happen to me.
Hannah'd be alone. l couldn't risk it.

312
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,730
But with other people...

313
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:20,120
lf it's a recording,
the soldiers who made it could be dead.

314
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,680
- lt's possible.
- That stuff about the answer to lnfection...

315
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:28,070
There is no answer!
lt's already done all the damage it can!

316
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,990
- Maybe they have a cure.
- Maybe they've got nothing.

317
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:35,160
- The only way to find out is to reach them.
- We could die trying, Frank!

318
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,550
Or die here.

319
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:45,330
And anyway, it isn't true what Dad said.
You need us just the same as we need you.

320
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,730
We need each other.

321
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:54,070
And we'll never be safe in the cities.
The soldiers could keep us safe.

322
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,900
So we have to try and get there.

323
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,600
Get there how?

324
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:14,770
Just so you know,
l don't take cheques or credit cards.

325
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,330
- (Frank) What do you think?
- lt's the most direct route.

326
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:51,680
Then we should take the indirect route.
The one in daylight and not underground.

327
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:54,070
(Frank) Let's just get it done.

328
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:09,200
(Jim) No, no.

329
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,770
No. See, this is a really shit idea.

330
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,030
You know why?
Because it's obviously a shit idea.

331
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:20,510
So we're gonna drive into the tunnel
full of fucking smashed cars...

332
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,510
lt's really fucking obviously a shit idea!

333
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,810
Hold on!

334
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:36,900
Dad!

335
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,030
(screaming and laughing)

336
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:57,860
Fuck!

337
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,550
The world's worst place to get a flat.

338
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,990
Agreed. l think we'd better do this quick.

339
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:09,640
l've got the wheel. You're on the jack.

340
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,770
Do you hear that?
Hey, hey, do you hear that?

341
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,940
Hear what?

342
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,900
(Hannah) Right, l've done it.

343
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:35,990
Dad?

344
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:38,160
(scrabbling sounds)

345
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,940
- Jesus Christ!
- (Hannah screaming)

346
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:44,550
Fucking rats!

347
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,680
They're running from the lnfected.

348
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:59,680
Move it!

349
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:04,070
Forget the jack, Hannah.
There's no time. Just lift, everyone.

350
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,420
Grab hold! One, two, three, lift!

351
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,330
Lift, lift!

352
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:18,990
- (Selena) Don't look at them! Don't look!
- (Jim) l can see them! They're coming!

353
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,680
(screeching)

354
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:27,290
Come on, Hannah!

355
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,770
Almost.

356
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,810
- Get the tyre on, Hannah!
- l'm trying.

357
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,250
Three, two, one,

358
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,070
drop it!

359
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,640
- Get in the car!
- Come on!

360
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,120
- Frank, drive!
- Move it, Frank!

361
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:58,120
(Jim) Whoo!

362
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,990
Goodbye, you fuckers!

363
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:15,250
Frank, stop the cab.

364
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:40,510
Let's shop.

365
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:49,510
(Frank making engine noises)

366
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,640
You...

367
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:54,940
You...

368
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:56,860
You...

369
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,510
(Jim) Anybody seen any buns?

370
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,420
Hmm. lrradiated.

371
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,680
Don't take anything
that needs to be cooked, OK?

372
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:10,640
l think you can eat that raw.

373
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:12,600
Decaffeinated coffee...

374
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,730
Put that back.

375
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,200
Can'tjust take any crap.

376
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:22,810
lf l never see another chocolate bar again,
it'll be too soon.

377
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,900
Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange!

378
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:31,120
Now, single malt,
16-year-old, dark, full flavour.

379
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,070
Warm but not aggressive.

380
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,640
- (Hannah and Selena laughing)
- Peaty aftertaste.

381
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,470
Takes out the fire but leaves in the warmth.

382
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,420
Either we do this now or we're walking.

383
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:49,510
Not you.

384
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,160
- Stay close, Jim.
- What?

385
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,330
You heard.

386
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,990
Where are you going?

387
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:29,470
We've got enough food, Jim.

388
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,900
We don't have any cheeseburgers.

389
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,330
(quietly) Like going on holidays
with your aunt!

390
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,990
Oh, Jesus.

391
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:44,330
Hello?

392
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,900
l hate you!

393
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:11,160
Find anything?

394
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:16,200
- Find anything, Jim?
- No! Let's get outta here.

395
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:18,380
OK, we're done here.

396
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,470
OK, Hannah.

397
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,510
Easy. Brake!

398
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,680
Brake, brake!

399
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:43,600
Out.

400
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,380
(Selena) Mmmm! Oh my God!

401
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,160
l can, like, taste the vitamin C.

402
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:38,770
Mmmm, the raisins are so moist.

403
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:42,070
What did you say?

404
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,940
The raisins. They're so moist.

405
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,770
Look over here.

406
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,940
Like a family.

407
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:07,470
(Hannah) Do you think they're infected?

408
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,990
(Frank) No.

409
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,160
They're doing just fine.

410
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,990
Come on. Let's eat!

411
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,990
Know what l was thinking?

412
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:43,770
That you'll never hear
another piece of original music again.

413
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:48,030
You'll never read a book
that hasn't already been written,

414
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:52,900
or see a film that hasn't already been shot.

415
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,680
Um.... that's what you were thinking.

416
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:02,640
No.

417
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,160
l was thinking l was wrong.

418
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,510
About what?

419
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,290
All the death.

420
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,990
All this shit.

421
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:22,120
lt doesn't really mean anything
to Frank and Hannah because...

422
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:26,940
Well, she's got her dad
and he's got his daughter. So...

423
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:29,160
Cheeky monkey!

424
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,250
l was wrong when l said
staying alive is as good as it gets.

425
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:39,380
See, that's what l was thinking.

426
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,550
Was it?

427
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,900
Mm. You stole my thought.

428
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,990
Sorry.

429
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:53,860
That's OK.

430
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,990
You can keep it.

431
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:01,120
lt's getting late.
We'd better stay here for the night.

432
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,730
l can't sleep.

433
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:21,470
Me neither.

434
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,900
Doesn't feel safe, does it?

435
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:26,070
Outside like this.

436
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,380
l think we're safe enough.

437
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:32,120
Selena didn't seem to have any trouble.

438
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:35,330
Yeah, l noticed that.

439
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:36,900
Hey, Selena...

440
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:39,070
What? What is it?

441
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,470
How'd you get to sleep?

442
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:52,810
Bloody hell. Must've needed
a hell of a prescription for that lot.

443
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:57,200
l didn't need a prescription.
l qualified as a chemist.

444
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,810
Oh, great. Valium.

445
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,470
Not only will we be able to get to sleep

446
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:06,250
but if we're attacked in the middle
of the night, we won't even care.

447
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:08,600
- Two each.
- Not for me, thanks.

448
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,730
Can l, Dad?

449
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:12,810
l don't think so, sweetheart.

450
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,380
Please?

451
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,990
- No.
- l can't sleep.

452
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,770
Come on, Frank. Let her live a little.

453
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:28,860
- Give her half of one.
- All right. We're on.

454
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,510
Night-night.

455
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:44,940
You're a big softie, Frank.

456
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:17,510
Frank?

457
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,640
Hannah?

458
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,640
Frank?

459
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,330
Hello? Hello!

460
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,640
Hello!

461
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:34,200
Hello! Hello!

462
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,250
(mumbles)

463
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:44,380
Shh...

464
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:48,550
You're having a bad dream, that's all.

465
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:53,380
Thanks, Dad.

466
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,380
(car horn)

467
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,250
Come on, sleepyhead.

468
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,990
Come on, Babe Ruth.

469
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,120
(Frank) Hurry up.

470
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:47,330
- Did l miss breakfast?
- (Selena) You'll sleep through anything.

471
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:52,420
- (Jim) Did you have a fry-up?
- (Frank) We'll stop at a pub on the way. Door!

472
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:21,510
(radio) Our location
is the 42nd blockade, the M602,

473
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,680
27 miles northeast of Manchester.

474
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:26,680
You must find us. Please!

475
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:28,900
Salvation is here.

476
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:31,990
The answer to lnfection is here.

477
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:06,120
Must be Manchester.

478
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:11,680
The whole of Manchester, the whole city.

479
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:15,860
No fire crews to put it out.

480
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,250
42nd blockade.

481
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,680
This is it.

482
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:30,810
l don't understand, Dad.
Did they leave?

483
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,030
- l don't like this. l think we should go.
- No!

484
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:45,680
Vehicles. We should check the vehicles.
There has to be something.

485
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:05,730
Nothing.

486
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:07,730
l can't believe it.

487
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:09,810
Frank...

488
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,120
Frank!

489
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:15,990
- We have to go.
- Yeah.

490
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,600
Go fucking where?!

491
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,640
(cawing)

492
01:04:57,730 --> 01:04:59,860
Get out of it.

493
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:05,470
Get out of it!

494
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:25,860
Dad, are you all right?

495
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:28,600
Yeah, l'm fine, sweetheart.

496
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:32,250
Sorry l lost my temper.

497
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:34,420
Hannah...

498
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:37,470
l love you very much.

499
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:39,550
- What?
- Keep away from me.

500
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,990
Stay where you are.

501
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:44,990
- Dad?
- Keep away from me! Keep away from me!

502
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:47,550
Keep away! Keep away! Keep away!

503
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,770
- Dad!
- Keep away! Keep away!

504
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:55,030
(Hannah) What's wrong? Dad!

505
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:01,730
Jim! Jim, he's infected!

506
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:04,470
- No!
- Now, Jim! Now!

507
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:07,990
- Jim, kill him! Jim!
- Dad!

508
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:09,330
Kill him!

509
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:20,120
Stay away from him!

510
01:06:21,330 --> 01:06:23,770
Keep away from the body!

511
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:28,420
Dad?

512
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:53,470
(man) Three survivors. One male, two female.

513
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:56,900
l repeat, one male, two female.

514
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:59,550
ETA, 15.

515
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,070
Put the kettle on.

516
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:52,550
l'm Major Henry West.

517
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:55,510
- Welcome.
- Jim.

518
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,600
Hello, Jim.

519
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,420
Hello.

520
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:06,550
Well, we've got beds with clean sheets
and a boiler that produces hot water.

521
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,030
So you can all have a shower.

522
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:12,470
You look like you need one. Please.

523
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:37,640
lt ain't funny. l got loads of cooking to do,
you fucking Doris!

524
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:40,810
Run him over!

525
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:46,330
(Jim) How is she doing?

526
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:49,600
She's lost her dad, Jim. That's how she is.

527
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:54,770
lt's all fucked.

528
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:56,860
What do you mean?

529
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:05,470
Oh, don't do that.
Come on, come on, come on.

530
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:07,640
Hey, don't do that.

531
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:14,290
Hannah is what Frank says she is. Tough,
strong, and she'll cope just like l'll cope.

532
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:18,330
- Just like you'll cope.
- l don't want her to have to fucking cope.

533
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,030
l want her to be OK.

534
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,770
When Hannah had her dad it was OK.

535
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:28,640
lt was OK for them and it was OK for us.

536
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:34,420
Now it's all just fucked.

537
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:08,680
So you heard our broadcast?

538
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:12,290
- Yeah, we did.
- We must be a disappointment.

539
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:18,470
You were hoping for a full brigade. An army
base with helicopters and a field hospital.

540
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:25,070
- We were just hoping for...
- The answer to lnfection.

541
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:29,510
Yeah.

542
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:34,070
As l said before, it's here. Though
it may not be quite what you imagined.

543
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:37,380
- Just feel lucky to have found you.
- You were lucky.

544
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:40,600
The fire drove hundreds of lnfected
out of Manchester.

545
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,770
The surrounding area's teeming with them.

546
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:48,120
But don't worry.

547
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:50,730
You're quite safe here.

548
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:59,680
Flat terrain all round the house. Floodlights
which we've rigged up to a generator.

549
01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:03,590
High perimeter wall which helps.

550
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:07,940
And we've been lacing the ground
with tripwires and land mines.

551
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:12,680
You wouldn't want to mow the lawn,
but if they get in, we hear them.

552
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:20,850
Secondary to protection,
our real job is to rebuild. Start again.

553
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:23,370
The belly of the house. The heart.

554
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:28,720
A wood-fired boiler providing us with hot
water. The first step towards civilisation.

555
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:30,900
The kitchen.

556
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:33,110
Here you are. l'll swap you.

557
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,370
- Now don't be throwing it.
- Here, give us some.

558
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:40,500
Don't be fighting.
Will you put that back? Put it back.

559
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:42,980
Jones, our resident tin opener.

560
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:46,070
- What are you cooking, Jones?
- Surprise, sir.

561
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:48,770
l can't wait.

562
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:58,500
And lastly, meet Mailer.

563
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:04,290
Mailer, Jim.

564
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:06,500
Jim, Mailer.

565
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:10,370
Got infected two days ago.

566
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:15,550
Mitchell managed to knock him out cold
and we got a chain round his neck.

567
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,240
Keeping him alive?

568
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:27,240
The idea was to learn something
about lnfection.

569
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:30,680
Have him teach me.

570
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:39,420
And has he?

571
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:43,770
ln a way.

572
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:53,370
He's telling me he'll never bake bread.

573
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:55,590
Farm crops,

574
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:58,370
raise livestock.

575
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:00,850
He's telling me he's futureless.

576
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:10,370
And eventually he'll tell me how long
the lnfected take to starve to death.

577
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:46,680
(singing)

578
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:52,590
You'll have to wait and see

579
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,900
Hope it's chips, it's chips

580
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:57,550
We hope it's chips, it's chips

581
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,070
(cheering)

582
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:08,550
Hat.

583
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:11,110
So, what have we here?

584
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:17,330
Tinned ham, tinned peas, tinned beans and...

585
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:24,850
- (man) Nice one, Doris!
- Omelette!

586
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:27,370
- lt's a feast, Jones.
- Honour of our guests.

587
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:30,680
Absolutely. l was going to propose a toast

588
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:33,900
but this omelette will do just as well.

589
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,980
- To new friends.
- (all) New friends.

590
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:53,370
Jones, did you notice while cooking
that these eggs were off?

591
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:56,850
l thought the salt might cover the taste, sir.

592
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:58,850
Get rid of it.

593
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:03,770
(man) Doris, you twat.

594
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:06,630
l don't suppose you can cook, can you?

595
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:12,940
l can't tell you how badly we need
someone with a little flair in the kitchen.

596
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:17,550
What a fucking disappointment.
l saw those eggs, l thought it was Christmas.

597
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:20,900
We'll have eggs again.
Once everything's back to normal.

598
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:23,810
You muppet! Look at him, eh?

599
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:27,940
He's still waiting
for Marks and Spencer's to reopen.

600
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:32,330
- You don't know nothing.
- l think Bill's got a point.

601
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:35,550
lf you look at the whole life of the planet,

602
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:37,550
we...

603
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:41,770
you know, Man has only been around
for a few blinks of an eye.

604
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:44,980
So if the infection wipes us all out,

605
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:48,290
that is a return to normality.

606
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:55,290
- That what you meant, Bill?
- Yeah, yeah.

607
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:58,630
Have you met our New Age sergeant?

608
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,420
Our spiritual guru.

609
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:06,720
Tell me, Farrell, exactly why
did you join the army in the first place?

610
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:13,630
This is what l've seen
in the four weeks since lnfection.

611
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:16,330
People killing people.

612
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:20,980
Which is what l saw in the four weeks before
lnfection, the four weeks before that...

613
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:26,500
As far back as l care to remember,
people killing people.

614
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:30,240
Which to my mind
puts us in a state of normality now.

615
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:41,500
- You're not eating?
- l don't want to eat.

616
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:44,370
You must eat, Hannah.

617
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:47,720
l don't want to eat.
l want to bury my dad.

618
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:51,720
He's one of the people you're talking about.

619
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:55,720
(explosion)

620
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:57,900
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

621
01:16:58,590 --> 01:17:00,900
Move!

622
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:03,290
Move! Move! Move!

623
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:07,370
(siren)

624
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,240
Enemy in front!

625
01:17:47,070 --> 01:17:49,590
Mick, l fucking got one!

626
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:53,290
What do you want, a fucking sweetie?
Keep shooting, you cunt!

627
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:08,200
Fucking hell! He bounced!

628
01:18:08,290 --> 01:18:09,900
Cease fire!

629
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:12,240
l ain't never seen that in my life!

630
01:18:12,370 --> 01:18:15,030
- Report clear!
- Fucking hell!

631
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:16,810
- Clear.
- Clear.

632
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,030
Yeah, yeah, clear.

633
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:30,680
Oh, hello!

634
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:32,850
(woif whistle)

635
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:40,550
Listen, sweetheart, you ain't
gonna be needing this any more.

636
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:42,810
Cos you got me to protect you now.

637
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:49,900
You wanna get your hands on a really
big chopper, you just come and see me.

638
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:51,460
Fuck you!

639
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:53,720
- That's an offer, Mitch.
- Give her some.

640
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:55,810
How about right now?

641
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:58,330
Mitchell!

642
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:04,420
Easy, tiger. You don't wanna go
picking a fight with me, son.

643
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:08,330
Sergeant Farrell!

644
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:15,200
- Mitchell, first action on.
- Resecure the perimeter.

645
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:18,720
Then get to it. Jones, Bedford, go with him.

646
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:23,030
Slow down.

647
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:29,110
- Sergeant?
- Sir.

648
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,900
Clear the bodies off the lawn.

649
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:37,370
The rest of you, go with him.

650
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:46,630
My apologies.

651
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:52,110
Drink?

652
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:59,680
Look, we're grateful, OK?

653
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:03,980
We're very grateful for your protection
but if we're gonna stay here...

654
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:05,590
- Who have you killed?
- No one.

655
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:10,850
Who have you killed? You wouldn't be alive
now if you hadn't killed somebody.

656
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:21,240
l killed... l killed a boy.

657
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:27,630
A child?

658
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:31,110
Yes.

659
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:37,680
But you had to.
Otherwise he'd have killed you.

660
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,070
Survival.

661
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,590
l understand.

662
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:53,460
l promised them women.

663
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:57,500
What?

664
01:20:58,630 --> 01:21:02,420
Eight days ago l found Jones
with his gun in his mouth.

665
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:08,330
He said he was going to kill himself
because there was no future.

666
01:21:08,420 --> 01:21:11,290
What could l say to him?

667
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:16,550
We fight off the lnfected or we wait
until they starve to death and then what?

668
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:21,330
What do nine men do
except wait to die themselves?

669
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:27,550
l moved us from the blockade, l set the radio
broadcasting and l promised them women.

670
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:34,240
Because women mean a future.

671
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:44,330
Selena! Hannah!

672
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:46,900
- What is it?
- We have to go.

673
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:49,030
- Jim, wait!
- No time! Come on!

674
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:54,070
Come on!

675
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,160
We get in the car and we go!

676
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:03,070
No! You're not going to keep them here!
You've got to let them go!

677
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:06,420
You can't keep them here!
Stay where you are!

678
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:09,200
l'm not gonna let you keep them here!

679
01:22:09,290 --> 01:22:11,200
You can't do this!

680
01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:16,070
Right, get him!

681
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:25,460
l want to give you a chance.

682
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:27,680
You can be with us.

683
01:22:29,290 --> 01:22:31,590
But l can't let them go.

684
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:39,810
OK, Jim? OK.

685
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,550
Him too.

686
01:22:59,630 --> 01:23:02,420
(Farrell) Smithers says
''Women and semen don't mix.''

687
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:05,420
And Mr Burns says
''We all know what you think, Smithers.''

688
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:08,420
And that was my favourite joke
in The Simpsons.

689
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:12,110
That's what they're doing a few
hundred miles away, across the Channel,

690
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:16,630
across the Atlantic. Eating dinner
and watching the fucking Simpsons!

691
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:19,980
They're sleeping in their beds
next to their wives.

692
01:23:20,070 --> 01:23:25,770
But we're here chained to a fucking radiator
because the OC has gone insane!

693
01:23:26,850 --> 01:23:30,900
Starting the world again when the rest
of the world hasn't even stopped.

694
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:35,370
Just imagine, just think about it.

695
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:38,720
How could lnfection cross the oceans?

696
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:43,110
How could it cross the mountains
and the rivers? lt can be stopped.

697
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,900
Right now TVs are playing
and planes are flying

698
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:49,980
and the rest of the world
is continuing as fucking normal.

699
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:53,420
Think! Actually think about it.

700
01:23:54,290 --> 01:23:57,850
What would you do
with a diseased little island?

701
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:04,110
They quarantined us.

702
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:10,980
''There is no lnfection.
lt's just people killing people.'' He's insane!

703
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:22,240
Time to go.

704
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:25,720
Quarantine?

705
01:24:57,550 --> 01:25:00,630
- Please...
- Believe me, l'm not interested.

706
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:06,850
You see, l'm gonna have the black one.
And l'm gonna make her squirm.

707
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:10,850
Mitchell, l swear to God
it's gonna end badly for you.

708
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,680
Move.

709
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:14,630
Come on, move! Get up!

710
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,770
Get up, you cunt! Fucking move!

711
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:18,420
Get up!

712
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,770
Move your fucking arse!

713
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:45,200
(Farrell) Come on then,
you fucking pansies. Do me first.

714
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:47,770
(Jones) No, Mitch. Mitch, just use the gat.

715
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:50,900
- (Farrell) So you're gonna stick me?
- (Jones) Shoot 'em!

716
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:53,630
- (Mitchell) Why?
- Because it's fucking quicker!

717
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:56,770
(Farrell) ls that how you'd let
your sergeant go out, Jones?

718
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:58,770
- l'll shoot them!
- No, you won't.

719
01:25:58,850 --> 01:26:02,330
You'll let him stick me?
Like a fucking dog?

720
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:07,810
l'm gonna enjoy this.

721
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:15,590
You stupid cunt! What are you doing?
You wanna shoot me?

722
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:19,850
- You wanna shoot me? l'll kill you!
- Where's he fucking gone?

723
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:23,940
Fuck it! Get up! Get after him!

724
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:29,630
- Jones, move it!
- l can see him! l can see him!

725
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,810
Where are you?

726
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:41,290
- Can you see him?
- Through there!

727
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:43,460
(gunfire)

728
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:52,550
Oh no. We're fucked.

729
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,240
We're fucked!

730
01:26:55,330 --> 01:26:56,720
Relax.

731
01:26:56,770 --> 01:27:00,240
He's over the wall. He's got no vehicle.

732
01:27:00,330 --> 01:27:03,070
And no shooter.

733
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,500
He's dead.

734
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:06,680
(thunder)

735
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:43,240
(West) The first thing we're going to do
is make you look more presentable.

736
01:27:43,330 --> 01:27:46,900
The lady of the house
has an extensive wardrobe

737
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:49,550
which she certainly has no use for.

738
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:52,370
You can't do it to Hannah.

739
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:56,160
Go to the master bedroom,
pick out a wide selection.

740
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:58,330
Yes, sir.

741
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:03,770
(Hannah) No...

742
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:06,900
(man) Ladies...

743
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:12,460
- lt's only dressing up!
- No! Selena!

744
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:15,900
- l thought girls liked dressing up.
- Expensive dresses.

745
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:17,590
(Hannah) Selena!

746
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:19,770
Whoa, whoa, relax!

747
01:28:20,850 --> 01:28:22,420
Selena!

748
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:32,590
Selena! Selena!

749
01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:38,770
You need to leave me alone
with Hannah. OK?

750
01:28:40,630 --> 01:28:44,370
- Listen, right. The OC wants...
- He wants us to dress up nice.

751
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:48,590
lf you want us to get changed,
you have to leave the room. OK?

752
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:01,940
lt's just polite.

753
01:29:07,940 --> 01:29:10,460
Yeah, all right.

754
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:12,290
All right.

755
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:15,240
Come on, lads. Let's leave the room.

756
01:29:38,330 --> 01:29:42,290
We're gonna eat these, Hannah, OK?
Come on. Eat these.

757
01:29:42,370 --> 01:29:44,500
Are you trying to kill me?

758
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:46,850
No, sweetheart.

759
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:49,500
l'm making you not care. OK?

760
01:29:50,810 --> 01:29:53,030
What you doing?!

761
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:57,500
(siren)

762
01:29:57,590 --> 01:30:00,070
- Someone's at the blockade!
- Jim!

763
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:01,370
Move!

764
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:04,110
Stay here and put the dresses on.

765
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,770
Let's go! Go!

766
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:12,550
He went over the wall.
We thought he'd be dead.

767
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:15,330
Shut up, Jones! Stay here.

768
01:32:23,810 --> 01:32:25,900
Davis?

769
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:00,500
(engine fails)

770
01:33:00,590 --> 01:33:02,420
Fuck it!

771
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:13,420
(gunfire)

772
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:57,290
- What was that?
- Lightning.

773
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:00,290
l heard something.

774
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:05,030
lt sounded like a Claymore to me.

775
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:10,030
All right, l'll go and hit the floods,
take a butcher's.

776
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:12,680
Girls,

777
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:15,420
keep an eye on him, will ya?

778
01:34:26,070 --> 01:34:28,500
Those pills,

779
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:31,070
l think they're having an effect.

780
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:33,680
l can feel them. And...

781
01:34:34,810 --> 01:34:37,160
l don't feel sleepy.

782
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:39,330
But...

783
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:44,720
They've been a long time.

784
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:49,500
What are you gonna do
if they don't come back?

785
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:53,330
Would you be the officer if Henry was dead?

786
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:55,420
ls that the way it works?

787
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,590
Shut up.

788
01:34:58,980 --> 01:35:03,070
l don't think they are coming back.
l think they've been killed.

789
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:05,720
- l said shut up!
- Hannah...

790
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:09,370
They're dead.

791
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:12,940
And you're gonna be next.

792
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:21,420
- Get up!
- Whoa!

793
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:25,110
We're gonna get out of here.
Stay with it, Hannah.

794
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:28,030
Don't worry. l feel fine. Really.

795
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:31,420
Get him off me!

796
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:34,900
Get him off me!

797
01:35:36,810 --> 01:35:38,720
lt's Jones! lt's Jones!

798
01:35:50,110 --> 01:35:55,630
Oi! Where the fuck are you going?
What's all the fucking shouting about?

799
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:57,810
(screaming)

800
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:06,980
Don'tjust stand there,
you soppy cunt! Get after them!

801
01:36:07,070 --> 01:36:09,070
You two, in there! Move!

802
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:20,810
(wheezing)

803
01:36:27,370 --> 01:36:29,330
Come on, then!

804
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:32,370
What the fuck you gonna do now?

805
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:37,370
(screaming)

806
01:36:53,070 --> 01:36:55,200
Come on up!

807
01:36:56,110 --> 01:36:57,810
