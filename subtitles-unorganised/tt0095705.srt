1
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:54,346
Listen to me! Killing a few hostages
is not sufficient!

2
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,015
The Americans must be made to suffer.

3
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,434
We must humiliate them.

4
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,145
You do not go far enough,
General Amin.

5
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,982
We must strip their entrails out
and drag them to Damascus,

6
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,903
until they include us
in the peace process.

7
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:14,491
Nonsense! This solution
is not bold enough for Libya.

8
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:18,620
l say wipe out Washington
and New York.

9
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,415
What? And spoil
three years of good PR?

10
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,710
The Americans believe l'm a nice guy.

11
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:30,006
ln some of their polls, l'm more
popular than their president!

12
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,930
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
This is getting us nowhere.

13
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:40,350
lf we do nothing else this week,

14
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,270
we must conceive
at least one terrorist act

15
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:47,190
that will show all the world

16
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:50,276
that the United States,
the great Satan,

17
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,530
is but a paper tiger - a weak nation,

18
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:58,410
a weak people,
a people ripe for destruction.

19
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:02,080
Cowards, no longer willing to fight.

20
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,437
l knew it!

21
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,683
Hey, who are you?

22
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,353
l'm Lieutenant Frank Drebin,
Police Squad.

23
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,689
And don't ever
let me catch you guys in America!

24
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,803
Watch out!

25
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,969
..98, 99, 100. lt's all here.

26
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:48,264
This completes
our first shipment of heroin.

27
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,475
100~/. pure.

28
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,811
lt better be - all 40 kilos.

29
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:56,314
The final shipment
will be delivered in three days.

30
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,943
- Then we'll expect payment.
- Don't worry.'

31
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,807
Police! Throw down your guns!

32
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,415
Kill him.

33
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:47,967
lt's a great day for Americans.
This man alone...

34
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,520
There he is!

35
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,690
No flowers, thank you.

36
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,402
Welcome home, Frank. Good work
in Beirut. We heard about it.

37
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:09,614
Thanks. l want to know one thing -
is it true about Victoria?

38
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,326
l'm afraid so.
She ran off with some guy.

39
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,996
They got married last week.

40
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:19,749
Then it's over.
All of this is meaningless.

41
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,627
l did it for her. Everything.

42
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,213
And now she's gone.

43
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:29,467
And you came down here
to get a hot story, didn't you?

44
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,095
Pictures of me
to sell your newspapers.

45
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,932
- Frank...
- Sure, you think l'm a big hero.

46
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:40,562
Do any of you understand
how a man can hurt inside?

47
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,772
Frank, they're not here for you.

48
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,358
''Weird Al'' Yankovic is on the plane.

49
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,658
What about the wedding?
What was she wearing?

50
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:57,162
Don't torture yourself!
Put her out of your mind.

51
00:08:57,287 --> 00:09:00,915
l can't get her out of my mind.
What about the guy?

52
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,252
- Do you know anything about him?
- Not much.

53
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,504
Just that he's an Olympic gymnast

54
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,299
and it's the best sex she's ever had.

55
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:14,971
l trusted her and followed my heart.
Foolishly, it seems.

56
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,682
l'm just gonna have
to learn to forget.

57
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:22,896
That's why l took my vacation
in Beirut - to find some peace.

58
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,023
lt won't be easy.

59
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,526
Everywhere l look,
something reminds me of her.

60
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,323
Maybe cops and women just don't mix.

61
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,826
What about Nordberg?
l came as soon as l heard.

62
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,287
He's alive, but on life support.

63
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,082
He's got a 50/50 chance of living,

64
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:46,294
though there's only
a 10~/. chance of that.

65
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,362
Mrs Nordberg, l think
we can save your husband's arm.

66
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,489
Where would you like it sent?

67
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:19,703
- Frank! l'm so glad you came!
- Wilma, l came as soon as l heard.

68
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,454
Thank you, Frank.

69
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,708
- Where's Nordberg?
- He's right here.

70
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,294
Nordberg, it's Frank, your buddy.

71
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,674
l'll get it!

72
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:39,264
Get the switch
at the back of the bed!

73
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,938
Nordberg, it's me, Frank.
Who did this to you?

74
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,024
l...love you.

75
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:54,237
l love you, too, Nordberg.
Who were they?

76
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,991
- Ship... Boat...
- That's right. A boat.

77
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,328
When you're better,
we'll go sailing together,

78
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,205
- just like last year.
- No... Drugs.

79
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,710
Nurse, give this man some drugs!
Can't you see he's in pain?

80
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,254
- Give him a shot, quickly!
- No...

81
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,549
Heroin! Heroin, Frank!

82
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,926
Nordberg, that's a pretty tall order.

83
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:20,180
Give me a couple of days
on that one.

84
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:26,770
Oh, my poor Nordberg!
He was such a good man, Frank.

85
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:31,232
He never wanted to hurt anyone.
Who would do such a thing?

86
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,984
lt's hard to tell.

87
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:38,114
A gang of thugs, a blackmailer,
an angry husband, a gay lover...

88
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,410
Frank, get a hold of yourself!

89
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:47,457
A good cop - needlessly cut down
by some cowardly hoodlums.

90
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:51,044
- No way for a man to die.
- You're right, Ed.

91
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,047
A parachute not opening -
that's the way to die,

92
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,591
getting caught in a combine,

93
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,302
having your nuts bit off
by a Laplander.

94
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,429
That's the way l want to go.

95
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,059
Frank! This is terrible!

96
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:11,523
Don't worry, Wilma.
Your husband is gonna be all right.

97
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:16,611
Just think positive.
Never let a doubt enter your mind.

98
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,697
He's right, Wilma,

99
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:23,702
but don't wait till the last minute
to fill out those organ donor cards.

100
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:27,497
What l'm trying to say is,
as soon as Nordberg is better,

101
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,749
he's welcome back at Police Squad.

102
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:34,879
Unless he's a drooling vegetable,
but that's only common sense.

103
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:41,261
Do you know why Nordberg
was at the waterfront?

104
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,056
No...

105
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,351
But l found this at home in a drawer.

106
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:55,984
A photograph!
''l Luv You'' out of Caracas.

107
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,778
A Panamanian ship.

108
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:03,033
When he said ''l love you'', he was
telling you the name of the ship!

109
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:06,202
l realise that...now.

110
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:10,081
- We'd better check this out.
- l want every available man on it.

111
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,250
l can't spare anybody.

112
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,463
We're in charge of security
for Queen Elizabeth's visit.

113
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,257
Wilma, whatever scum did this,

114
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:23,803
no man will rest until he's behind
bars. Let's grab a bite to eat.

115
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:34,189
Due to the extraordinary efforts
of some of our civic leaders,

116
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:39,069
Queen Elizabeth has included
the city of Los Angeles

117
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:43,323
as one of the cities she'll visit
during her American tour.

118
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:49,079
Will the city hire
additional security officers?

119
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:54,334
We have placed the Queen's security
in the hands of Police Squad,

120
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,545
a special division
of the Police Department,

121
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,715
represented here
by Lieutenant Frank Drebin.

122
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,721
Thank you, Your Honour.

123
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,599
Louder!

124
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,771
- You can use my radio mic.
- Thank you.

125
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:25,240
Thank you, Your Honour.
Protecting the Queen's safety

126
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:29,577
is a task that is gladly accepted
by Police Squad.

127
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:33,748
No matter how silly the idea
of having a queen might be to us,

128
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:38,837
as Americans we must be gracious
and considerate hosts.

129
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,674
Thank you, Lieutenant Drebin.

130
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,513
Of course, we all have a stake
in seeing that this portion

131
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:53,226
of the Queen's American tour
is completely protected.

132
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:58,148
And we can take pride
that the Queen...

133
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:06,197
lndeed, it is for all the people,

134
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:11,536
who will be able to share
in these...celebrations...

135
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,999
Especially exciting...

136
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:22,922
will be...the Queen's...
public appearances.

137
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,732
We also would like...

138
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:04,047
Ed and l drove to where Nordberg
had been found floating.

139
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:09,177
Without leads, you have to start
somewhere, and that was the harbour.

140
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,555
Please disperse. Please disperse.

141
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:16,976
There's nothing for you to see here.
Keep moving.

142
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,895
Where did they find him?

143
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,064
Out there.
Do you wanna take a dinghy?

144
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:24,359
No, l took care of that
at the press conference.

145
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,737
lt doesn't make sense.
Good policeman, bright future...

146
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,156
then something like this happens.

147
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,283
He was found by the nightwatchman.

148
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:35,120
l'm gonna talk to the harbour-master.

149
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,247
l'll walk around and snoop.

150
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:46,548
- Yeah?
- Lieutenant Drebin, Police Squad.

151
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,217
l remember you. What do you want?

152
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:53,013
l wanna ask some questions.
Are you familiar with that face?

153
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:56,474
l don't know.
My memory ain't so great.

154
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:59,561
Oh, yeah?
Maybe this'll refresh your memory.

155
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,688
- Still hazy.
- How about this?

156
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,940
l remember. Why do you want to know?

157
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:07,569
- l can't tell you.
- Maybe this'll help.

158
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:11,197
- l don't think l should.
- Still don't think so?

159
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,784
- lt's Nordberg, he's a cop.
- No, he was dealin' 'H'.

160
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,619
- What?
- He was dirty!

161
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,622
Scum! l ought to
run you in right now!

162
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:23,251
He worked at Ludwig's Shipping.
He tried to push something.

163
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,671
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Why should l tell you?

164
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,924
- Maybe this'll help.
- l shouldn't tell you.

165
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,469
Can you spot me a 20? How about now?

166
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,721
l'm going down to Ludwig's office.

167
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:37,432
l'll find out
if you're telling the truth.

168
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:43,605
Vincent Ludwig owned one
of the city's largest corporations.

169
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,274
A respected business man
and civic leader,

170
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,569
he was to chair the Queen's reception
committee.

171
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:53,907
Now l was about to question him about
drugs and attempted murder.

172
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:02,916
- Mr Ludwig?
- Yes?

173
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,960
Lieutenant Drebin to see you, sir.

174
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,465
Show him in.

175
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:17,931
- Lieutenant.
- The feeling is mutual.

176
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:21,810
Nice to meet you, too. Cuban?

177
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:26,398
No, Dutch-lrish.
My father was from Wales.

178
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,024
Sit down.

179
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:31,361
- What a magnificent office.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

180
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:35,990
Most objects l have collected
over a period of many years -

181
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:40,787
my Gainsborough, Ming vases.
Priceless!

182
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:45,834
They are objects which l feel
reflect my personality,

183
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,128
like the Japanese fighting fish -

184
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:51,256
beautiful, graceful, elegant...

185
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,591
yet single-minded of purpose

186
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:57,345
and deadly when it finds
what it wants.

187
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:02,559
This particular one
is valued at over $20,000.

188
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:05,270
A luxury item, to be certain,

189
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:09,274
but l am a man who appreciates
the finer things in life.

190
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:13,445
Oh, this...
This is a rare Samurai pen,

191
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,448
a gift from Emperor Hirohito.

192
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:20,577
Unbreakable.
lmpervious to everything but water.

193
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:25,540
- lts value is beyond estimation.
- That's fascinating.

194
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:30,587
But l'm sure you didn't pay this
visit for a lecture on fine art.

195
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:33,381
To what do l owe the honour?

196
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:37,260
l'm investigating the attempted
murder of a dock worker,

197
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,682
a man named Nordberg,
a police officer.

198
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,603
He is still alive, then?

199
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:49,064
He was shot six times.

200
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:52,400
Fortunately, the bullets missed
every vital organ.

201
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:56,196
- The salt water preserved him.
- So they...

202
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,782
So they got him
to the hospital in time?

203
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:02,869
He's in the intensive care ward
at Our Lady of the Worthless Miracle.

204
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:06,206
This certainly comes
as a shock to me.

205
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:11,544
As you know, l'm not the kind of man
who takes such things lightly.

206
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:15,548
There is no room in my organisation
for criminal activity.

207
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:20,053
Look out there - a vast
commercial development built by me.

208
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:24,224
Do you have any idea what was
out there just five years ago?

209
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,769
You bet you do. Orange groves!

210
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,939
Acres of them.
As far as the eye could see.

211
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:35,902
But now that land will generate
ten times the amount of profit.

212
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,906
Are you all right, Lieutenant?

213
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,325
Let me get you some Kleenex.

214
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,870
Has this officer -

215
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,081
What's his name? Nordberg -

216
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:52,210
been able to tell you anything?

217
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:56,798
Well, he hasn't been able
to tell us a thing so far,

218
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,801
but as soon as
he regains consciousness,

219
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:04,014
we'll see if he
can still play the guitar.

220
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:07,559
- Pardon?
- l've taken up a lot of your time.

221
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:10,270
l'd like to look
at your employment records

222
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,814
and speak to someone in Personnel.

223
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,482
Of course.

224
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:18,278
- Dominique, send in Miss Spencer.
- Yes, sir.

225
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:23,074
l am quite busy making arrangements
for the royal visit,

226
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:27,078
but l will have my assistant
provide you with anything you need.

227
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,540
You've been very co-operative.
l'll note that in my report.

228
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,459
My pleasure.

229
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,924
Miss Spencer! This is
Lieutenant Drebin from Police Squad.

230
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,553
Hello...Mr Drebin.

231
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:45,805
Hello.

232
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,481
Oh!

233
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:13,541
Her hair was the colour
of gold in old paintings.

234
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:17,879
She had a full set of curves

235
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:22,759
and the kind of legs
you'd like to suck on for a day.

236
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:26,554
She gave me a look
l could feel in my hip pocket.

237
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:32,477
Yep, this was starting
to get interesting.

238
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:41,695
- Nice beaver.
- Thank you.

239
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,782
- l just had it stuffed.
- Let me help you with that.

240
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:50,870
This should be
what you're looking for -

241
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,707
the shipping and employment records
for Pier 32.

242
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,418
Thank you.

243
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:59,045
l've heard police work is dangerous.

244
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,464
Yes, that's why l carry a big gun.

245
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:04,384
Couldn't it go off accidentally?

246
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:06,761
l used to have that problem.

247
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,888
What did you do about it?

248
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:11,474
l just think about baseball.

249
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,563
That's a honey of an ankle-bracelet
you have there.

250
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,441
Did it slip down there again?

251
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:22,402
Yes, well...
l'll quickly go through these

252
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:24,529
and get them back to you tomorrow.

253
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:29,284
Fine, but there's no rush.
l mean, whenever you're through.

254
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:33,538
Thank you. l wish there was
some way l could repay you.

255
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:38,835
How about dinner? l know a place
that serves great Viking food.

256
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,048
lt's tempting, but l'm afraid
l must rest this evening,

257
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,175
tomorrow being Arbor Day.

258
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,136
Of course. Perhaps some other time.

259
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:51,806
- How about a rain check?
- Let's just stick to dinner.

260
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:55,518
Thank you for your help,
Miss Spencer.

261
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:58,897
My pleasure.

262
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:02,651
- Well?
- Mr Ludwig, you startled me!

263
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,611
l'm sorry, my dear.

264
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:07,864
Did you give the lieutenant
what he wanted?

265
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:10,533
l gave him copies of the files
for Pier 32.

266
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,661
Good. That's good.

267
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:17,749
He is an intriguing fellow,
don't you think?

268
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:21,836
Well, l don't know.
l've only just met him.

269
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,797
He seems very nice.

270
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:27,092
Jane, l realise
this is an unusual request,

271
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:30,512
but if there is something illegal
going on in this company,

272
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:34,391
l need to know about it,
so we can root it out.

273
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,559
That's why l want you to...

274
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:40,897
well, to get to know Drebin
a little better,

275
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:43,024
find out what he knows.

276
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,902
Wouldn't this be best handled
by the police?

277
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:49,322
We are letting the police handle it,
my dear!

278
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:52,492
But we need to know
the facts quickly

279
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:55,703
before anything
gets into the newspapers.

280
00:24:55,829 --> 00:25:00,250
Don't forget, l have a responsibility
to the stockholders.

281
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,878
Well...if you put it that way...

282
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:07,882
- Yes, l'll do my best.
- That's better.

283
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:13,847
l'm sure you will.

284
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:23,440
lt was about 4pm
when l returned to Police Squad.

285
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:28,153
l wanted to see what the lab had
come up with on Nordberg's jacket,

286
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:30,697
the one they'd found on the docks.

287
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:34,492
You can tell a lot from fibre
samples if they aren't too wet.

288
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:37,162
l was hoping we wouldn't
come up dry.

289
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:38,872
Hey, look out!

290
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,876
Police! Halt!

291
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:54,679
Anybody catch the licence plate?

292
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:58,183
Anybody get a look at the driver?

293
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:04,898
Take the names of everybody here
for questioning.

294
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:08,777
l've got to get...inside.

295
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:18,912
Hi, Ed, Ted. You got
those fibre samples yet?

296
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:21,081
- We got some action here.
- What?

297
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:23,625
We're testing our anti-graffiti wall.

298
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,585
We've got customers.

299
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:29,381
lt reacts when
the spray hits the sensors.

300
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,886
You've done it again - mazel tov!

301
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:37,764
Good work.
What will you think of next?

302
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:39,891
Now that you mention it,

303
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:42,852
here's something
we developed only yesterday.

304
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:45,772
To the casual observer -
an ordinary shoe.

305
00:26:45,897 --> 00:26:49,776
But in actuality...
it makes a handy weapon.

306
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:53,113
And everything a cop would need.

307
00:26:53,238 --> 00:26:55,281
We call it the Swiss Army Shoe.

308
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:59,953
- Great. And the fibre samples?
- Just one more thing.

309
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:02,330
See these cufflinks l'm wearing?

310
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:07,085
They're not just cufflinks. Each one
fires a single pin-sized dart,

311
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,255
that knocks out your victim
for a few minutes.

312
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,590
Let me demonstrate on Ed.

313
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:17,262
Ted! Why?

314
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:22,267
Don't worry.
He'll be up and around in no time.

315
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:26,479
- Why don't you take a pair?
- Actually, l could use another pair.

316
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:28,440
l think you'll like them.

317
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:31,276
- Want this, chief?
- Thank you, Al.

318
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:34,446
There's something
on the side of your mouth, Al.

319
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:37,073
No, no. The other side.

320
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:41,870
As you requested, we took some
fibre samples from Nordberg's jacket.

321
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,372
l'm afraid it doesn't look good.

322
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:47,959
- What do you mean?
- Take a look for yourself.

323
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:54,466
- l can't see anything.
- Use your open eye, Frank.

324
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:57,218
Yeah, l can see it now.

325
00:27:57,343 --> 00:28:00,889
At first, it appears
to be the normal cotton fibres.

326
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:03,683
But we discovered
a fine white powder.

327
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:07,520
Pure heroin.

328
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:10,690
How well do you know Nordberg?

329
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:14,361
We were partners for nine years
and he's my best friend.

330
00:28:14,486 --> 00:28:17,864
We can't allow personal feelings
to get in the way.

331
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:22,702
- Are you saying that Nordberg...?
- The Queen arrives in two days.

332
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:25,330
lf the press should pick this up,

333
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:28,500
it could be embarrassing
for the police and the city.

334
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:32,837
l'm sorry, Frank. l'm giving you
24 hours to clear Nordberg.

335
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,392
- Mr Ludwig?
- Yes?

336
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:50,105
- A Mr Pahpshmir is here.
- Show him in.

337
00:28:57,362 --> 00:29:00,407
ls there something wrong, Mr Ludwig?

338
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:02,242
No, it's nothing.

339
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:06,579
- Then may we get down to business?
- Certainly. Have a seat.

340
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:09,791
l can carry out your request.

341
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:14,129
- My price is $20 million.
- Your price is not a problem.

342
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:19,551
But there is concern
on the part of those l represent,

343
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:25,432
that you would be able to...
complete so difficult a task.

344
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:27,892
Tell me, Mr Pahpshmir,

345
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:33,565
in all the world,
who is the most effective assassin?

346
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:39,154
l would think anyone who manages to
conceal his identity as an assassin.

347
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:44,200
Yes, but there is
even a more ideal assassin.

348
00:29:46,328 --> 00:29:50,540
One who doesn't know
he is an assassin.

349
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:53,334
- Care for some tea?
- Yes, please.

350
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:56,504
Dominique, service for two, please.

351
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:10,769
l must kill Pahpshmir.

352
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:22,530
- Cream and sugar, sir?
- Mr Pahpshmir?

353
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:28,411
Cream only, please.

354
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:34,292
- There's a gun on the floor, sir!
- Just leave it. lt's all right.

355
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:37,629
- The tea, please.
- Of course, sir.

356
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:44,135
Mr Pahpshmir, have you ever seen
sensory-induced hypnosis?

357
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,262
l think l just have.

358
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:49,099
How will she get near the target?

359
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:53,144
Oh, l doubt whether it will be her.

360
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:56,940
Good secretaries
are so hard to find these days.

361
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:59,651
And it seems to me...

362
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:04,281
anyone...can be an assassin.

363
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:12,414
l had 24 hours to find
something to clear my friend's name.

364
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:15,458
l returned to the hospital
with Ludwig's records

365
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:18,044
to try to jog Nordberg's memory.

366
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:21,840
Doctor, l have the chart,
if you're ready to go over it.

367
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:25,051
l'll be with you
when l've finished with Mr Nordberg.

368
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:27,220
Yes, Doctor.

369
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:35,478
You'll be out of here
in a couple of...

370
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:45,280
- l'd like to see Officer Nordberg.
- Sign in, please.

371
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:48,700
Wait a minute!
Where's the police guard?

372
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:52,746
- Drebin called and sent him home.
- Drebin?

373
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:58,460
l must kill Nordberg.
l must kill Nordberg.

374
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:01,796
Drebin, Police Squad!
Let go of that pillow!

375
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:34,120
Medical emergency!

376
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:44,297
Drebin, Police Squad.
Follow that black car!

377
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:48,301
The car! Follow that car!

378
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:52,013
Stephanie, check your mirror. Signal.

379
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:54,557
Now pull into traffic.

380
00:32:57,769 --> 00:32:59,896
Try and ease off on the brake.

381
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,194
- Give it a little gas.
- l know a short cut. Turn left here!

382
00:33:09,572 --> 00:33:11,908
- There he is!
- Easy!

383
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:28,758
Turn right! Follow him!

384
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:32,762
lt's OK.
Normally, you would not be going 65

385
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:35,932
down the wrong way
of a one-way street.

386
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:39,894
Apply the brakes.

387
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,689
Now put it in reverse.

388
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:52,615
- You dumb broad!
- Stephanie...

389
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:54,909
Gently extend your arm.

390
00:33:56,661 --> 00:34:00,081
Extend your middle finger.

391
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:05,920
- Very good. Well done.
- There he is!

392
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:08,465
Go for it, Stephanie!

393
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:55,553
Excuse me. Excuse me.

394
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:59,099
All right, move on!
Nothing to see here!

395
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:01,643
Please disperse!

396
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:04,270
Nothing to see here. Please!

397
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:11,194
The attempt on Nordberg's
life left me shaken and disturbed.

398
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:14,155
The questions kept coming up
again and again,

399
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:16,324
like bubbles in a case of soda.

400
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:19,744
Who was this character
in the hospital?

401
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:23,665
Why was he trying to kill
Nordberg...and for whom?

402
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,669
Did Ludwig lie to me?
l didn't have any proof,

403
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:30,338
but somehow,
l didn't entirely trust him.

404
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:34,217
Why was the ''l Luv You''
not listed in Ludwig's records?

405
00:35:34,342 --> 00:35:37,053
lf it was, did he know about it?

406
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:39,389
lf he didn't, who did?

407
00:35:39,514 --> 00:35:41,683
And where the hell was l?

408
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:47,272
lt was almost midnight
when l got home.

409
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:50,108
l just wanted
to slip under my blankets,

410
00:35:50,233 --> 00:35:53,612
but my night was
just about to begin.

411
00:36:32,442 --> 00:36:34,861
You're late.

412
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:38,740
That depends on what l'm late for.

413
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:41,868
You said we should
have dinner some time.

414
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:44,829
Tonight became ''some time''.

415
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:48,458
l'm boiling a roast.

416
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:53,213
How hot and wet do you like it?

417
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:58,552
Very hot and awfully wet.

418
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:02,389
You seem to know your way
around a kitchen.

419
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:05,934
l'm just as handy
in other rooms of the house.

420
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,353
That shirt looks familiar.

421
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:12,690
lt's yours. l didn't want
to get stained or wrinkled.

422
00:37:12,816 --> 00:37:15,777
At least...not yet.

423
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:23,076
Do you mind if l slip
into something more comfortable?

424
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:31,918
There. That's better.

425
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:37,132
l hope you've brought your appetite.

426
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:39,092
l've brought everything.

427
00:37:39,217 --> 00:37:41,803
Well, then, dig in.

428
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:51,146
lnteresting. Almost as interesting
as the photographs l saw today.

429
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:53,606
l was young. l needed the work.

430
00:37:53,732 --> 00:37:56,818
No, they were taken
at Ludwig's docks.

431
00:37:56,943 --> 00:38:01,156
A ship came in, a Panamanian ship.
lt wasn't on Ludwig's records.

432
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:03,533
Probably an oversight.

433
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:06,953
How is your...meat?

434
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,083
You be the judge of that.

435
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:17,172
Mmm...

436
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:22,427
l've got nine more.

437
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,060
- Have you seen that ship?
- l don't know.

438
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:33,938
lt doesn't look like ours,
but we deal with so many ships.

439
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:36,941
Has Officer Nordberg
told you anything?

440
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:41,071
No, there's been another attempt
on his life. He's in a coma.

441
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:45,450
That's terrible!
This world is such a violent place.

442
00:38:45,575 --> 00:38:48,244
lf it wasn't, l'd be out of a job,

443
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:53,041
but l'd give it up tomorrow
to live in a world without crime.

444
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:56,294
That's beautiful.

445
00:38:59,547 --> 00:39:02,342
This is all happening too fast.

446
00:39:05,136 --> 00:39:08,765
- l've been hurt before.
- l'm sorry.

447
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:13,311
l'd known her for years.

448
00:39:13,436 --> 00:39:16,773
We used to go to
all the police functions together.

449
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:20,068
How l loved her,
but she had her music.

450
00:39:20,193 --> 00:39:22,946
l think she had her music.

451
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:26,825
She'd hang out with the
Chicago Male Chorus and Symphony.

452
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:30,954
l don't recall her playing
an instrument or being able to sing.

453
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,999
Yet she was on the road
300 days of the year.

454
00:39:34,124 --> 00:39:39,170
l bought her a harp for Christmas.
She asked me what it was.

455
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:44,050
lt's the same old story.
Boy finds girl.

456
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:46,845
Boy loses girl. Girl finds boy.

457
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:49,973
Boy forgets girl. Boy remembers girl.

458
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,309
Girl dies in a blimp accident

459
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:55,270
over the Orange Bowl
on New Year's Day.

460
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:58,440
- Goodyear?
- No, the worst.

461
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:00,275
Poor dear!

462
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:07,073
Now, now. l don't want to upset you.

463
00:40:07,198 --> 00:40:10,160
Frank, it's not that.

464
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:12,662
Why did you have to be so wonderful?

465
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:19,002
- There's something l must tell you.
- No! No need to tell me anything.

466
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:22,005
What's in the past
doesn't matter anyway.

467
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,506
Maybe...

468
00:40:23,632 --> 00:40:28,553
Maybe we're just two lonely souls
who have found each other.

469
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:34,851
Funny-face!

470
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,289
l want you to know...
l practise safe sex.

471
00:40:56,414 --> 00:40:58,124
So do l.

472
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:36,514
l had a wonderful day, Frank. l can't
believe we just met yesterday.

473
00:42:37,432 --> 00:42:40,477
You really mean that?
You're not just saying it,

474
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:43,021
because we exchanged bodily fluids?

475
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:46,483
No, l really mean it.
You're very special.

476
00:42:46,608 --> 00:42:50,904
- Can l interest you in a nightcap?
- No, thanks, l don't wear them.

477
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:53,323
Actually, l'm on stake-out tonight.

478
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:57,327
l'll be thinking about you.
l'll call you tomorrow.

479
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,121
OK.

480
00:43:06,669 --> 00:43:08,672
Good night!

481
00:43:19,057 --> 00:43:22,102
The answer's up there
in Ludwig's office.

482
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:25,146
Call it what you will -
a hunch, women's intuition.

483
00:43:25,271 --> 00:43:27,440
Ludwig knows more than he's saying.

484
00:43:27,565 --> 00:43:31,528
A hunch won't stand up in court.
Where are your hard facts?

485
00:43:31,653 --> 00:43:35,490
He's the only one except us
who knew Nordberg was still alive.

486
00:43:35,615 --> 00:43:40,036
Next thing we know,
some thug tries to knock him off.

487
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:45,083
Maybe. But breaking into Ludwig's
office is taking a big chance.

488
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:48,628
l know. You take a chance
getting up in the morning,

489
00:43:48,753 --> 00:43:51,840
crossing the street
or sticking your face in a fan.

490
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:53,967
There he is!

491
00:43:57,762 --> 00:44:00,932
Just trust me on this, Ed.
l know l'm right.

492
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:02,976
OK, but be careful.

493
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:06,146
Get some sleep.
l'll see you in the morning.

494
00:44:57,906 --> 00:44:59,908
Bingo!

495
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:49,666
''20,000,000 deposited,
Omani Bank, Zurich,

496
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,960
''upon proof of Queen's death.''

497
00:48:14,436 --> 00:48:16,646
Destroying property, arson...

498
00:48:16,771 --> 00:48:19,858
sexual assault
with a concrete dildo?!

499
00:48:19,983 --> 00:48:22,777
What the hell were you doing there?

500
00:48:22,902 --> 00:48:24,946
l'm sorry about that, Your Honour,

501
00:48:25,071 --> 00:48:29,284
but we believe Ludwig is involved
in a plot to assassinate the Queen.

502
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:33,163
That's ridiculous!
Where is this ''evidence''?

503
00:48:33,288 --> 00:48:37,208
Well...it...burned in the f-fire.

504
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:38,960
Gentlemen,

505
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:43,423
Vincent Ludwig is one of the most
respected members of this community.

506
00:48:43,548 --> 00:48:48,261
lf we're very nice to him,
he will agree not to press charges.

507
00:48:48,386 --> 00:48:51,056
- Your Honour!
- Did l make myself clear?

508
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:53,725
Yes, Your Honour. Good day.

509
00:48:56,061 --> 00:48:58,062
Drebin!

510
00:48:58,188 --> 00:49:04,444
l don't want any more trouble like
you had last year. That's my policy.

511
00:49:04,569 --> 00:49:09,783
When l see five weirdos dressed
in togas stabbing a guy in a park,

512
00:49:09,908 --> 00:49:12,952
l shoot the bastards.
That's my policy.

513
00:49:13,078 --> 00:49:19,876
That was a Shakespeare in the Park
production of ''Julius Caesar''!

514
00:49:20,001 --> 00:49:24,631
- You killed five actors! Good ones.
- Your Honour...

515
00:49:24,756 --> 00:49:29,052
Your presence at the Queen's
reception tonight is not necessary.

516
00:49:29,177 --> 00:49:31,096
ls that understood?

517
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:34,265
We understand, Your Honour.
Thank you.

518
00:49:57,289 --> 00:49:59,874
The plane has taxied to a stop.

519
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,961
Any minute now
we expect the doors to open

520
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:05,630
and we'll get a glimpse
of the Queen,

521
00:50:05,755 --> 00:50:09,759
as she begins her first visit
to Los Angeles in five years.

522
00:50:09,884 --> 00:50:13,388
lt's a balmy, beautiful evening too.

523
00:50:13,513 --> 00:50:16,891
She's going from here
to a formal reception...

524
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:25,358
- Jane!
- Frank!

525
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:30,572
l'm just making some dinner.
Are you hungry?

526
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:32,699
Maybe just a bite.

527
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:35,869
Ludwig wanted me to ask you
to meet him tonight.

528
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:40,540
There is something you should know.
l was in his place last night.

529
00:50:40,665 --> 00:50:45,462
How nice! Did he show you his
Ming vases and rare oil paintings?

530
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:49,883
Jane, l think that he's involved
in a number of criminal activities.

531
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:52,010
Frank, stop it!

532
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:55,430
Vincent Ludwig is a well-respected,
generous, kind man.

533
00:50:55,555 --> 00:50:58,767
- You don't know him like l do.
- How's that?

534
00:50:58,892 --> 00:51:04,314
- What's that supposed to mean?
- l'm sorry. l'm worried about you.

535
00:51:04,439 --> 00:51:08,526
l don't trust him and l don't want
you mixed up in anything dangerous.

536
00:51:08,652 --> 00:51:11,863
Are Woo back in business?
They closed down three years ago.

537
00:51:11,988 --> 00:51:16,993
Gee, has it been that long? l don't
feel like Chinese tonight anyway.

538
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:23,416
lt's sweet of you to be concerned,
but you're wrong about Vincent.

539
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:27,295
He's such a gentleman.
He's so generous.

540
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:29,422
He just wants to talk with you

541
00:51:29,547 --> 00:51:32,759
to clear up any doubts
you might have.

542
00:51:32,884 --> 00:51:34,928
- When?
- Tonight.

543
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:37,889
Meet him at the 7th Street
stockyards.

544
00:51:38,014 --> 00:51:40,850
All right,
but promise you'll be careful.

545
00:51:40,976 --> 00:51:44,562
Of course l will,
funny-face, for you.

546
00:51:45,855 --> 00:51:48,608
l've got to go. See you tomorrow.

547
00:51:48,733 --> 00:51:52,529
Are you sure you won't have
something to eat?

548
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,931
Ludwig?

549
00:52:20,056 --> 00:52:23,101
- Drebin?
- Yeah, l'm Drebin.

550
00:52:23,226 --> 00:52:26,938
l have a message for you
from Vincent Ludwig.

551
00:52:29,899 --> 00:52:31,901
l'm sorry, l can't hear you!

552
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:34,988
Don't fire the gun
while you're talking.

553
00:52:57,552 --> 00:53:02,349
All right, put your gun down
and your hands up!

554
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:38,802
Matthews, stake out that end,

555
00:53:38,927 --> 00:53:42,972
and card-check for
anyone suspicious looking.

556
00:53:43,098 --> 00:53:45,141
Frank, what are you doing here?

557
00:53:45,266 --> 00:53:49,020
l've been trading shots
with one of Ludwig's goons.

558
00:53:49,145 --> 00:53:52,816
They're planning
to do her tonight, here.

559
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:57,862
- We better be on the lookout.
- Excuse me, ma'am, security.

560
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:04,411
- What's the meaning of this?
- Relax! Nothing will happen.

561
00:54:04,536 --> 00:54:07,580
- l didn't do anything.
- Yeah? What about this?

562
00:54:07,706 --> 00:54:12,001
You think we were born yesterday?
You didn't do anything, huh?

563
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:13,670
l got rights!

564
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:17,007
Ed, he's got a picture of your wife!

565
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:19,134
Ethel!

566
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,430
All right,
anyone else here seeing his wife?

567
00:54:23,513 --> 00:54:26,850
That's all right, Frank.
Let's get in the hall.

568
00:54:37,694 --> 00:54:39,696
Are you enjoying yourself, my dear?

569
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:44,409
l'm so excited to be here.
l appreciate your inviting me.

570
00:54:44,534 --> 00:54:48,330
Pleasure's all mine.
Perhaps afterwards we can...

571
00:54:50,582 --> 00:54:52,375
- Drebin!
- Frank!

572
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,587
You're both right.
Surprised to see me, Mr Ludwig?

573
00:54:55,712 --> 00:54:58,590
This is not the time
or place to talk.

574
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:01,259
lt's way past the time we talked.

575
00:55:01,384 --> 00:55:03,803
The gloves are off,
l'm playing hardball.

576
00:55:03,928 --> 00:55:08,183
lt's fourth and fifteen, and
you're looking at a full court press.

577
00:55:08,308 --> 00:55:12,229
Mr Drebin!
lf you have evidence, then use it.

578
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:16,274
lf not, l am warning you -
get off my back!

579
00:55:16,399 --> 00:55:18,401
Or it will cost you dearly.

580
00:55:21,196 --> 00:55:25,366
- Frank, what's wrong?
- A lot of things, sweetie-pie.

581
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:29,162
A meeting that turned into
a peek-a-boo session with bullets,

582
00:55:29,287 --> 00:55:32,499
set up by someone
who's been playing me like a violin.

583
00:55:32,624 --> 00:55:35,376
Funny-face,
what are you talking about?

584
00:55:35,502 --> 00:55:39,506
My stockyard meeting, butter-wings.
Don't you remember setting that up?

585
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:42,759
Mr Ludwig said you'd called it off!
Believe me!

586
00:55:42,884 --> 00:55:45,178
Thumb me another one, shuckie-lumps!

587
00:55:45,303 --> 00:55:48,014
Frank, it's the truth!

588
00:55:48,139 --> 00:55:52,060
Cops and women don't mix.
Like eating a spoonful of Drano.

589
00:55:52,185 --> 00:55:55,980
lt'll clean you out,
but it'll leave you hollow inside.

590
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:58,108
Too bad, sugar-puff.

591
00:55:59,567 --> 00:56:02,279
We could have been something.

592
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:05,073
l only did what l was told to do!

593
00:56:05,156 --> 00:56:07,450
- Like make love to me?
- Frank!

594
00:56:09,202 --> 00:56:11,371
That makes things easier, Princess.

595
00:56:11,496 --> 00:56:14,791
To think l trusted you!
l made a big mistake.

596
00:56:14,916 --> 00:56:18,461
- You can take this back.
- Whose is that?

597
00:56:20,588 --> 00:56:24,759
Doesn't matter.
Take care of yourself, baby.

598
00:56:26,177 --> 00:56:28,054
By the way...

599
00:56:28,179 --> 00:56:30,098
l faked every orgasm.

600
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:33,101
Funny-face!

601
00:56:33,935 --> 00:56:36,437
And to commemorate our friendship,

602
00:56:36,563 --> 00:56:41,067
the city of Los Angeles is proud
to present to the Royal Family

603
00:56:41,192 --> 00:56:47,282
this Revolutionary War musket,
donated by Mr Vincent Ludwig.

604
00:56:48,658 --> 00:56:51,828
Ladies and gentlemen,
Her Royal Highness,

605
00:56:51,953 --> 00:56:54,748
Queen Elizabeth ll!

606
00:57:29,908 --> 00:57:34,663
lt's disgusting the way they splash
this stuff all over the newspapers!

607
00:57:34,788 --> 00:57:37,374
What is journalism coming to?

608
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:41,086
You're laying on top of the Queen
with her legs wrapped around you

609
00:57:41,211 --> 00:57:42,754
and they call that news!

610
00:57:42,921 --> 00:57:46,383
They can't kick you off the Force,
it's not fair.

611
00:57:46,508 --> 00:57:49,344
l know. Life isn't always fair.

612
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:54,849
Just think, the next time l shoot
someone, l could be arrested.

613
00:57:54,974 --> 00:57:57,060
Hey, look at that!

614
00:57:57,185 --> 00:58:02,273
The missing evidence in the Kilner
case! My God, he WAS innocent!

615
00:58:02,399 --> 00:58:05,652
He went to the chair
two years ago, Frank.

616
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:09,114
Well...what's the use?

617
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:12,283
What good are these damn awards
and citations?

618
00:58:12,409 --> 00:58:13,993
Frank...

619
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:16,621
Frank, that's not your desk!

620
00:58:16,746 --> 00:58:20,041
Frank! l've been
looking all over for you!

621
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:23,211
Running another errand
for your boyfriend?

622
00:58:23,336 --> 00:58:26,881
l tried to call last night.
l went by your place. Where were you?

623
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:29,384
l was out walking. All night.

624
00:58:29,509 --> 00:58:32,470
Listen to me!
l have important information.

625
00:58:32,595 --> 00:58:36,307
There was never anything
between Vincent and me.

626
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:39,769
- He likes East German men.
- What about you?

627
00:58:39,894 --> 00:58:42,021
l like cops.

628
00:58:42,147 --> 00:58:45,984
- All right! Yeah!
- Settle down. Take it easy.

629
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:50,030
- What've you got?
- l overheard Ludwig.

630
00:58:50,155 --> 00:58:55,243
You were right. He is planning to
have someone assassinate the Queen!

631
00:58:55,368 --> 00:58:57,704
- Where?
- At the baseball game.

632
00:58:57,829 --> 00:59:01,207
The Queen will be there
as Ludwig's guest.

633
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:05,420
ls Ludwig going to shoot her
in front of 60,000 fans?

634
00:59:05,545 --> 00:59:08,298
No, a player,
during the 7th inning stretch.

635
00:59:08,423 --> 00:59:11,217
- lt starts in 20 minutes.
- l'll go.

636
00:59:11,343 --> 00:59:14,304
- l'll go with you.
- Stay with Ludwig

637
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:17,640
- to allay suspicion.
- OK, let's go!

638
00:59:17,766 --> 00:59:19,517
Wait! Wait!

639
00:59:19,643 --> 00:59:23,688
l've gotten you into enough trouble
already. l'll go alone.

640
00:59:23,813 --> 00:59:28,693
No! This'll get you back on
the Force. We're right behind you.

641
00:59:31,571 --> 00:59:35,784
Frank? l wanted you to know now,

642
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:40,163
l've loved you since the first day
l met you, and l'll never stop.

643
00:59:40,288 --> 00:59:42,290
l'm a very lucky woman.

644
00:59:42,916 --> 00:59:44,292
So am l.

645
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:57,138
Good afternoon.
We're coming live from the Big A,

646
00:59:57,263 --> 01:00:00,392
where the California Angels
meet the Seattle Mariners

647
01:00:00,517 --> 01:00:04,813
in their showdown
for the Division League.

648
01:00:04,938 --> 01:00:08,650
Hello! l'm Curt Gowdy,
along with Jim Palmer,

649
01:00:08,775 --> 01:00:11,820
Tim McCarver, Dick Vitale, Mel Allen,

650
01:00:11,945 --> 01:00:15,115
Dick Enberg and Dr Joyce Brothers.

651
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,951
Join us for this
all-important ball game.

652
01:00:18,076 --> 01:00:19,786
And a special game it is.

653
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:23,707
As we know, it is being attended
by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.

654
01:00:23,832 --> 01:00:26,501
l'm sure she'll enjoy this game, Jim.

655
01:00:27,585 --> 01:00:29,629
We've got all the exits covered.

656
01:00:29,754 --> 01:00:31,798
l ought to arrest Ludwig right now.

657
01:00:31,923 --> 01:00:35,760
No, we've got to let him
make the first move.

658
01:00:35,885 --> 01:00:39,556
The Mayor would have you arrested.
You've got to stay out of sight.

659
01:00:39,681 --> 01:00:42,350
l've got to get that assassin.

660
01:00:42,434 --> 01:00:44,561
lt could be any of those players.

661
01:00:44,686 --> 01:00:48,189
l've got to get down on that field
and search those players.

662
01:00:48,314 --> 01:00:51,818
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise and welcome

663
01:00:51,943 --> 01:00:54,487
Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth ll!

664
01:01:03,246 --> 01:01:05,248
One moment.

665
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:10,253
Over there - these seats are taken.

666
01:01:25,852 --> 01:01:29,355
My dear, is something bothering you?

667
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:31,149
No, why do you ask?

668
01:01:31,274 --> 01:01:35,445
You haven't said a word.
You seem...nervous.

669
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:40,200
Well, you know how important
this game is for the Angels.

670
01:01:40,325 --> 01:01:43,870
Why he not here now?
l do not like to wait for him.

671
01:01:43,995 --> 01:01:49,751
Mr Pallazzo, our head usher will
be here in two minutes. Please wait.

672
01:01:49,876 --> 01:01:54,214
- He should be here now!
- l'll send him right over.

673
01:01:54,339 --> 01:01:57,384
l do not wait for him!
He waits for me!

674
01:02:02,097 --> 01:02:04,516
- Yes?
- Mr Pallazzo?

675
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:08,311
l am the head usher.
l am here to... Excuse me.

676
01:02:14,025 --> 01:02:17,445
- Mr Pallazzo?
- Yes?

677
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:21,533
- l am the head usher.
- One second.

678
01:02:21,658 --> 01:02:23,118
Ladies and gentlemen,

679
01:02:23,243 --> 01:02:27,539
on behalf of the California Angels
and the City of Los Angeles,

680
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:30,041
on the occasion of the royal visit,

681
01:02:30,166 --> 01:02:33,628
please welcome
internationally-renowned opera star,

682
01:02:33,753 --> 01:02:36,131
Enrico Pallazzo!

683
01:02:39,092 --> 01:02:42,554
Ladies and gentlemen,
let us honour America,

684
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:48,602
as Mr Pallazzo will now sing
our national anthem.

685
01:04:10,266 --> 01:04:14,312
And now we'll wait
for the exchange of line-ups

686
01:04:14,437 --> 01:04:16,689
and the start of today's ball game.

687
01:04:25,198 --> 01:04:29,911
Excuse me, could you tell me,
is this an official bat?

688
01:04:33,248 --> 01:04:36,793
The Queen's visit
has brought a sell-out crowd!

689
01:04:36,918 --> 01:04:41,172
And the fans are being entertained
by the stadium's Angel Vision,

690
01:04:41,297 --> 01:04:45,135
showing some unusual moments
in baseball over the years!

691
01:05:05,447 --> 01:05:07,449
Sorry, fellas!

692
01:05:35,352 --> 01:05:37,604
How about that?

693
01:05:39,397 --> 01:05:41,149
Ladies and gentlemen,

694
01:05:41,274 --> 01:05:45,779
now taking the field -
your California Angels!

695
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:55,705
For everybody's safety,

696
01:05:55,830 --> 01:06:00,043
we ask that you do not throw
any objects on the field.

697
01:06:00,168 --> 01:06:02,629
We thank you for your co-operation.

698
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:09,844
As the Angels take the field, we're
ready for the first pitch ceremony

699
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:13,932
with the Queen of England
ready to toss out the first ball.

700
01:06:17,394 --> 01:06:21,439
How about that?
Let's have a round of applause!

701
01:06:21,564 --> 01:06:23,942
We're ready for the start,

702
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:26,987
as these lovely ladies would agree.

703
01:06:27,112 --> 01:06:30,615
Those are the players' wives,
here to enjoy the game.

704
01:06:38,623 --> 01:06:41,751
What d'you say, Cummings?
Are we gonna do this today?

705
01:06:41,876 --> 01:06:43,461
Do what?

706
01:06:43,586 --> 01:06:45,338
Play ball!

707
01:06:48,508 --> 01:06:51,427
Frank! Al, it's Frank!

708
01:06:56,433 --> 01:07:00,854
The game's under way. Dave Spiwack
ready to face Jay Johnstone!

709
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:23,418
- Nothing to report.
- Don't worry, Al.

710
01:07:23,543 --> 01:07:26,963
lf one of the players is the killer,
Frank'll find him,

711
01:07:27,088 --> 01:07:30,300
even if he has to search
every one of them.

712
01:07:30,425 --> 01:07:33,762
..lead-off hitter Jay Johnstone.

713
01:07:33,887 --> 01:07:37,849
Hello, pal. Let's see
if that uniform's on straight.

714
01:07:37,974 --> 01:07:42,812
Good here. Now let's see the shirt.
You should take a large.

715
01:07:42,937 --> 01:07:46,024
lt's a little tight in the crotch.

716
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:48,526
All right? All set?

717
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:53,364
OK, play ball!

718
01:08:21,935 --> 01:08:23,854
Strike?

719
01:08:27,232 --> 01:08:29,484
Yeah, strike!

720
01:08:42,455 --> 01:08:46,584
Stee-rike two!

721
01:09:01,725 --> 01:09:07,063
Stee-rike three!

722
01:09:56,821 --> 01:09:58,615
You're clean!

723
01:11:49,392 --> 01:11:50,936
Have you found him yet?

724
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:53,605
No, and l've searched
almost everybody.

725
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:57,859
Yeah. There's only one more out
before the seventh inning stretch.

726
01:11:57,984 --> 01:12:02,447
You're going to have to stall them.
Don't let 'em get that third out.

727
01:12:02,572 --> 01:12:04,199
Right.

728
01:12:05,825 --> 01:12:11,706
The Mariners' number four -
Armando Criscione! Criscione!

729
01:12:18,963 --> 01:12:21,883
- Ball!
- Ball?

730
01:12:32,352 --> 01:12:33,937
Ball!

731
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,909
Get...get...what the...? Get off!

732
01:12:48,994 --> 01:12:50,996
Catch it! Catch it!

733
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,544
- Get 'em off!
- Go, go, go!

734
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,426
- Safe!
- What do you mean, safe?

735
01:13:04,551 --> 01:13:06,636
l don't believe it!

736
01:13:08,763 --> 01:13:10,557
Second base! On two!

737
01:13:11,766 --> 01:13:13,810
There's a throw by the catcher

738
01:13:13,935 --> 01:13:17,313
and now they've got Criscione
hung up between 1st and 2nd!

739
01:13:17,438 --> 01:13:19,524
What the hell are you doing?

740
01:13:19,649 --> 01:13:20,775
What?

741
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:25,655
- You're not supposed to do that!
- Wait a minute! Stop that!

742
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:28,450
Put that back down! Give me the ball!

743
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:32,704
l'll get you!

744
01:13:32,829 --> 01:13:35,081
lt's hard to believe,

745
01:13:35,207 --> 01:13:38,877
but apparently the umpires
have got Criscione in a run-down!

746
01:13:41,629 --> 01:13:43,339
- Safe!
- Safe?

747
01:13:43,465 --> 01:13:44,841
How about that?

748
01:13:44,966 --> 01:13:46,760
- Out!
- Safe!

749
01:13:46,885 --> 01:13:48,845
- Out!
- He was safe!

750
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:50,138
- Out!
- Safe!

751
01:13:50,263 --> 01:13:52,724
There's a sight l've never seen!

752
01:13:54,518 --> 01:13:56,436
- Safe!
- What are you doing?

753
01:13:56,561 --> 01:13:58,062
Safe! Safe! Safe!

754
01:13:58,187 --> 01:14:00,940
- He was out!
- He was safe!

755
01:14:01,065 --> 01:14:03,818
You idiot! He was out!

756
01:14:03,943 --> 01:14:06,279
All right, you're out of here!

757
01:14:06,404 --> 01:14:09,449
- What?
- You can't throw an umpire out!

758
01:14:09,574 --> 01:14:12,077
All right, YOU'RE out!

759
01:14:13,203 --> 01:14:17,332
Hold on! Even the guy running
the scoreboard says he was out!

760
01:14:17,457 --> 01:14:20,752
And he's up in the mezzanine!

761
01:14:20,877 --> 01:14:22,253
lt's the third out!

762
01:14:39,646 --> 01:14:42,732
l must kill...the Queen.

763
01:14:47,445 --> 01:14:49,989
l must kill...the Queen.

764
01:14:52,742 --> 01:14:54,744
Frank, it's the right-fielder!

765
01:15:01,084 --> 01:15:04,796
- You're the boss!
- lt was safe.

766
01:15:04,921 --> 01:15:07,465
Now, we're going to take a walk.

767
01:15:07,882 --> 01:15:10,719
How could you
do something so vicious?

768
01:15:10,844 --> 01:15:15,682
lt was easy. Don't forget l spent
two years as a building contractor.

769
01:15:15,807 --> 01:15:18,018
Now, let's go quietly.

770
01:15:22,564 --> 01:15:24,607
Hey, look at that! Let's get him!

771
01:15:35,911 --> 01:15:38,079
Kick him in the balls!

772
01:16:11,112 --> 01:16:14,074
l must kill...the Queen.

773
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:27,003
Look out!

774
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:36,346
The umpire...
He saved the Queen's life!

775
01:16:36,471 --> 01:16:38,473
That's not the umpire, Your Honour.

776
01:16:42,686 --> 01:16:44,687
Hey, it's Enrico Pallazzo!

777
01:16:55,699 --> 01:16:58,743
Frank! Frank, help!

778
01:16:58,868 --> 01:17:01,830
Frank! Frank, help! Frank!

779
01:17:16,636 --> 01:17:18,513
Hold it, Ludwig!

780
01:17:18,638 --> 01:17:20,974
Stay where you are!

781
01:17:21,099 --> 01:17:23,518
- He's got a gun!
- l know.

782
01:17:23,643 --> 01:17:27,313
You ruined my life.
Now l'm going to ruin yours.

783
01:17:27,438 --> 01:17:30,400
- Leave the girl alone!
- l am. l'm going to kill you.

784
01:17:30,525 --> 01:17:32,527
l see.

785
01:17:35,989 --> 01:17:38,158
Two can play at that game!

786
01:17:44,748 --> 01:17:47,584
- You killed him!
- No, just stunned.

787
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:49,627
He'll be all right.

788
01:17:56,051 --> 01:17:57,844
Well...

789
01:18:23,328 --> 01:18:26,373
Frank...it's horrible!

790
01:18:27,624 --> 01:18:31,711
- lt's so horrible!
- l know, Ed.

791
01:18:32,378 --> 01:18:34,380
My father went the same way.

792
01:18:50,104 --> 01:18:54,275
l must kill...Frank Drebin.

793
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,445
l must kill...Frank Drebin.

794
01:18:58,571 --> 01:19:00,782
No, no, don't shoot!

795
01:19:01,157 --> 01:19:04,995
Jane...it's me...

796
01:19:07,372 --> 01:19:08,748
Funny-face.

797
01:19:08,874 --> 01:19:12,669
l must kill Frank Drebin.

798
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:15,547
You love Frank Drebin.

799
01:19:15,672 --> 01:19:18,633
And Frank Drebin loves you.

800
01:19:18,758 --> 01:19:22,637
Jane, if you don't love me,
you might as well pull that trigger,

801
01:19:22,762 --> 01:19:28,518
because without you,
l wouldn't want to live anyway.

802
01:19:28,643 --> 01:19:32,063
l've finally found
someone l can love -

803
01:19:32,188 --> 01:19:36,317
a good, clean love...
without utensils.

804
01:19:36,442 --> 01:19:39,237
l must kill Frank Drebin.

805
01:19:40,447 --> 01:19:42,782
lt's a topsy-turvy world, Jane,

806
01:19:42,907 --> 01:19:47,495
and maybe the problems of two people
don't amount to a hill of beans,

807
01:19:47,621 --> 01:19:51,124
but this is our hill
and these are our beans.

808
01:19:52,667 --> 01:19:57,172
Since l met you, l've noticed
things l never knew where there -

809
01:19:57,297 --> 01:20:01,009
birds singing, dew glistening
on a newly-formed leaf,

810
01:20:01,134 --> 01:20:03,470
stop lights...

811
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:05,221
l must kill...

812
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:08,683
Jane, this morning...

813
01:20:08,808 --> 01:20:12,979
l bought something for you.
lt's not very much,

814
01:20:13,104 --> 01:20:18,193
but pretty good
for an honest policeman's salary.

815
01:20:18,318 --> 01:20:20,236
lt's an engagement ring.

816
01:20:20,361 --> 01:20:22,364
l'd have given it to you earlier,

817
01:20:22,489 --> 01:20:25,700
but l wanted to wait
until we were alone.

818
01:20:29,913 --> 01:20:32,874
- l...
- l love you, Jane.

819
01:20:38,338 --> 01:20:40,131
Oh, Frank!

820
01:20:52,602 --> 01:20:54,812
l'm sorry!

821
01:21:05,448 --> 01:21:09,911
l'm sorry that l yelled at you
yesterday, l really am.

822
01:21:11,913 --> 01:21:13,248
Drebin!

823
01:21:13,373 --> 01:21:16,042
l was wrong about you.

824
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:20,213
This city and the whole world
owes you a debt of gratitude.

825
01:21:20,338 --> 01:21:21,506
Thank you.

826
01:21:21,631 --> 01:21:24,926
And Monday morning
we want you back at Police Squad...

827
01:21:25,051 --> 01:21:29,014
- with a promotion to captain.
- Mayor...

828
01:21:29,139 --> 01:21:33,810
Don't thank me. There's someone else
here who wants to thank you.

829
01:21:33,935 --> 01:21:36,271
- Nordberg!
- Hiya, buddy!

830
01:21:36,396 --> 01:21:39,232
The doc says
l should be on my feet in a week!

831
01:21:39,357 --> 01:21:43,236
- And back on the Force!
- Nordberg, that's wonderful!

832
01:21:44,612 --> 01:21:47,866
Frank! Everyone should have
a friend like you!
