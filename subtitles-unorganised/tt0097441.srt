1
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,837
One! One!

2
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,036
One, two, one!

3
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,756
<i>''Dear Mother.
I hope you are keeping well...</i>

4
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,508
<i>and not worrying too much about me.</i>

5
00:01:58,572 --> 00:02:01,164
<i>You mustn't think that any of us
are going to be killed...</i>

6
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:03,884
<i>for they are collecting
such a force here...</i>

7
00:02:03,948 --> 00:02:06,125
<i>that an attack would be insane.</i>

8
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:08,749
<i>The Massachusetts men
passed through here this morning.</i>

9
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:13,165
<i>How grand it is to meet the men
from all the states, east and west...</i>

10
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:15,149
<i>ready to fight for their country...</i>

11
00:02:15,213 --> 00:02:17,229
<i>as the old fellows did
in the Revolution.</i>

12
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:21,709
<i>But this time we must make it
a whole country...</i>

13
00:02:21,773 --> 00:02:25,196
<i>for all who live here,
so that all can speak.</i>

14
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,422
<i>Before this war began...</i>

15
00:02:29,486 --> 00:02:32,717
<i>many of my regiment
had never seen a Negro.</i>

16
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:35,949
<i>Now the roads are choked
with the dispossessed.</i>

17
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:39,182
<i>We fight for men and women...</i>

18
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:42,126
<i>whose poetry is not yet written,
but which will presently...</i>

19
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,230
<i>be as enviable
and as renowned as any.</i>

20
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:50,350
<i>Last night we heard
of yet another defeat.</i>

21
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:52,335
<i>But we are not disheartened.</i>

22
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:55,407
<i>I am honored to be part
of such a splendid company.</i>

23
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:59,566
<i>They have made me captain,
of which l am enormously proud.</i>

24
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,638
<i>You would think it strange to see me
giving orders to a hundred men...</i>

25
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:04,558
<i>most of whom are older than I am.</i>

26
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,654
<i>Thank you for sending
my volume of Emerson.</i>

27
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:11,087
<i>His words come home to me
like truth--</i>

28
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:16,175
<i>'A deep man, ' he says, 'believes
that the evil eye can wither...</i>

29
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,575
<i>that the heart's blessing
can heal...</i>

30
00:03:18,638 --> 00:03:21,743
<i>and that love
can overcome all odds. '</i>

31
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:25,870
<i>My dearest love to Father.</i>

32
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:28,399
<i>Your son, Robert."</i>

33
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:46,223
Charge!
Company, forward!

34
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:49,327
Charge!
Company, forward!

35
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:53,584
- Charge!
- Fire!

36
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:08,464
Fire!

37
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,496
Aim!

38
00:04:14,064 --> 00:04:15,985
Fire!

39
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:26,193
Stand. Fire!

40
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,601
Steady, boys!

41
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:39,346
- Forward!
- Fire!

42
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:51,921
Forward, men!

43
00:04:51,985 --> 00:04:54,513
For God's sake, come on!

44
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:13,297
Robert, come on!
We must fall back!

45
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:15,250
No! Forbes!

46
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:18,609
Forbes!

47
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,354
Charge!

48
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:43,795
Fire!

49
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:40,789
You all right there, Captain?

50
00:08:08,215 --> 00:08:10,072
Please! Not my leg!

51
00:08:10,136 --> 00:08:12,856
- Where's the chloroform?
- Stop!

52
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,776
Stop!

53
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:20,376
No! Wait!

54
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,256
- No!
- Hold on!

55
00:08:25,143 --> 00:08:26,679
So it's your neck?

56
00:08:26,743 --> 00:08:30,200
The surgeons are busy,
but l'll fix you up.

57
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:32,120
- Let me know if l hurt you.
- Stop!

58
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:34,232
Ah, this is nothing.

59
00:08:35,287 --> 00:08:38,071
- Heard the latest?
- What's that?

60
00:08:38,135 --> 00:08:40,568
l heard it from a friend
who's a dispatch rider...

61
00:08:40,632 --> 00:08:44,825
who got it from one of Stanton's clerks
in the War Office.

62
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:47,993
He says Lincoln is gonna issue
an emancipation proclamation.

63
00:08:48,057 --> 00:08:50,841
Gonna free the slaves.

64
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,552
- What?
- Maybe not in the border states...

65
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:56,729
but he will free some, anyway.

66
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:58,680
My God.

67
00:08:58,744 --> 00:09:01,560
He said he would have done it sooner,
only he was waiting for a big vicfory...

68
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,737
which is, I guess, what this is.

69
00:09:03,801 --> 00:09:06,137
Oh, my God!

70
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:09,017
Please don't cut anymore, please!

71
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,226
Please!

72
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:13,368
This might hurt you, Captain.
l'm sorry.

73
00:09:42,971 --> 00:09:45,338
Dashing.

74
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:11,675
- Robert.
- Thomas.

75
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:15,483
Captain Shaw.
l was so proud when l heard.

76
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:18,651
They had no choice.
All the other officers are dead.

77
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:21,467
- And Forbes?
- lmpossible, as always.

78
00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:23,835
He's here somewhere.

79
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:25,274
How about you?

80
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:28,091
Working for your father,
helping him with the resettlement...

81
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:30,043
for the Freedmen's Relief Association.

82
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:33,851
There's a shortage of housing.
Robert! Are you all right?

83
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:35,771
Yes. l'm sorry.

84
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,500
Darling, there's someone
who wishes to meet you.

85
00:10:41,564 --> 00:10:44,860
General Hunter rounded up
a bunch of slaves...

86
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:48,283
called them contraband
and put them in camps like cattle.

87
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:52,060
The War Department decided
to issue them pikes rather than guns.

88
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,588
Ot course they deserted.
So would l.

89
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:57,725
Robert. Governor,
you know my son Robert.

90
00:10:57,789 --> 00:11:00,701
- Good to see you again.
- Governor Andrew.

91
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:03,357
Robert, have you met
Frederick Douglass?

92
00:11:08,956 --> 00:11:10,845
Mr. Douglass.

93
00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:14,748
l understand you were at Antietam.

94
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:22,940
A great and a terrible day.

95
00:11:25,277 --> 00:11:26,942
l could use your help.

96
00:11:28,093 --> 00:11:31,452
The governor is proposing to raise
a regiment of Negro soldiers.

97
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:35,422
No. lt was not just my idea.
Mr. Douglass--

98
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,110
We will offer pride and dignity...

99
00:11:38,174 --> 00:11:40,285
to those who have known
only degradation.

100
00:11:40,349 --> 00:11:44,094
- Colored soldiers. Just think of it.
- Wonderful.

101
00:11:44,158 --> 00:11:46,782
l've submitted your name
to be commissioned colonel...

102
00:11:46,846 --> 00:11:50,046
of the 54th Massachusetts lnfantry.

103
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,262
Thank you, Governor.
That's--

104
00:11:59,326 --> 00:12:01,182
lt's a wondertul idea.

105
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:06,237
Excuse me.

106
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:12,927
Well done, Shaw.

107
00:12:12,991 --> 00:12:15,390
- Splendid job, young man.
- Bravo, Robert.

108
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,031
What's the matter?
Too much punch?

109
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:44,704
l know how much you'd like to
make colonel, but a colored regiment?

110
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:51,775
You know how popular that would be?

111
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,527
Handing out guns
to a thousand coloreds?

112
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,768
Hey, Robert.

113
00:13:05,664 --> 00:13:07,519
What's wrong?

114
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,880
l'm gonna do it.

115
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,480
You're not serious.

116
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:27,744
- I want you to come with me.
- Me?

117
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:30,400
And you?

118
00:13:35,872 --> 00:13:38,688
Can you picture me
in charge of a regiment?

119
00:13:41,536 --> 00:13:43,585
Picture me in charge of anything.

120
00:13:44,672 --> 00:13:47,520
l would be honored to have you.

121
00:13:51,074 --> 00:13:53,248
Then you're an idiot.

122
00:13:54,593 --> 00:13:58,913
Rob, is it true?
There's to be a colored regiment?

123
00:13:58,977 --> 00:14:01,441
So it seems.

124
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:03,521
Then l am your first volunteer.

125
00:14:13,122 --> 00:14:15,522
Present arms!

126
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,770
How do we look, Colonel?
We gonna whup the Secess'?

127
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:22,625
When do we get the blue suit?

128
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,121
Yeah, the blue suit.

129
00:14:32,226 --> 00:14:34,371
Ready to whip them Rebs.

130
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:38,114
When are we gonna get to fight?

131
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,035
Are we really gonna get to fight
this time?

132
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:52,771
Attention!

133
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:57,732
Morning.

134
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:03,364
Good morning, gentlemen.

135
00:15:03,428 --> 00:15:06,532
I am Colonel Robert Gould Shaw.

136
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:08,451
l am your commanding officer.

137
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:15,076
lt is a great pleasure
to see you all here today.

138
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:20,740
lt is my hope that the same courage...

139
00:15:20,804 --> 00:15:24,228
spirit and honor...

140
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:26,628
which has brought us together...

141
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,963
will one day restore this Union.

142
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,988
May God bless us all!

143
00:15:39,492 --> 00:15:41,828
Form companies?

144
00:15:41,892 --> 00:15:44,101
We will commence
with forming companies.

145
00:15:44,165 --> 00:15:46,020
Company officers, take charge.

146
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:52,357
You recruits will report
to your respective officers...

147
00:15:52,421 --> 00:15:56,517
by the letter of your company
in aIphabetical order...

148
00:15:56,581 --> 00:16:01,125
which is in the top left-hand corner
of your muster sheet.

149
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:21,606
- Good book, brother?
- Yes, it is, actually.

150
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,102
Name's SearIes. Thomas Searles.

151
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:26,789
Jupiter Sharts, sir.
What it about, that book?

152
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,445
lt's a collection of essays--
Fourier, Emerson...

153
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:31,974
all the transcendentalists.

154
00:16:32,037 --> 00:16:33,894
It got pictures?

155
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,149
- Teach me?
- Yes, l'd be happy to.

156
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:53,926
Look at what's walking in here!

157
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,846
l'd rather have a hog
than a nigger.

158
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:59,175
- At least you could eat the hog!
- Getting dark mighty earIy around here.

159
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:05,927
Show us a little dance,
nigger boys!

160
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,831
Sergeant of the Guard,
post your sentry.

161
00:17:25,895 --> 00:17:27,752
Yes, sir!

162
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:39,943
Wait, no. That's my space, nigger.

163
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:41,863
l sleep better close by the door.

164
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,871
l prefer a space
with more reading light.

165
00:17:46,344 --> 00:17:48,648
Oh, l like it when niggers
talk good as white folk.

166
00:17:49,832 --> 00:17:51,369
l'd be happy to teach you.

167
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:53,897
lt would be my pleasure.

168
00:17:53,961 --> 00:17:57,640
Look, snowflake, l ain't got nothing
to learn from no house nigger.

169
00:17:57,704 --> 00:18:01,992
l am a free man,
as was my father.

170
00:18:02,056 --> 00:18:05,192
Good. Move your free black ass
before l bust it up.

171
00:18:05,257 --> 00:18:07,241
- Hey, hold up, buck.
- Nobody said nothing to you, pap.

172
00:18:07,305 --> 00:18:10,089
lt's all right.

173
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:12,008
l'll be fine over here.

174
00:18:12,072 --> 00:18:14,185
- Mm-hmm.
- Excuse me.

175
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:19,977
Wonder when they gonna
give us the blue suit.

176
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,657
Ain't no blue suit for the black
soldiers. Blue suits for the whites.

177
00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:27,177
Well, we soldiers now.

178
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:29,705
Where you from, field hand?

179
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:31,434
South Carolina.

180
00:18:31,498 --> 00:18:33,897
You ought to know better, boy.

181
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:38,217
Hey, would you quit that?
Say, boy, quit that drumming.

182
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:51,658
What's your name?

183
00:18:53,578 --> 00:18:55,434
l said what's your name, boy?

184
00:18:55,498 --> 00:18:58,410
- Can't you see that he's mute?
- He what?

185
00:18:58,474 --> 00:19:00,459
He's mute.

186
00:19:02,186 --> 00:19:04,458
You mean this child can't talk?

187
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:08,875
Hey, come over here, hon.

188
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,690
Dummies and field hands.
Ain't that a bitch?

189
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:18,442
What about you, buck?
Whereabouts you from?

190
00:19:20,523 --> 00:19:23,210
l'm from around Tennessee.

191
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:25,930
Ran away when l was 12 years old,
and l ain't never look back.

192
00:19:25,994 --> 00:19:28,203
What you doing since then?

193
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:31,210
l run for president.

194
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,715
l didn't win though.

195
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,555
Boy.

196
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:12,139
Major? Forbes.
That's you.

197
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:13,676
- Thomas.
- Hello.

198
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,140
- How are you?
- You know Charlie Morse.

199
00:20:16,204 --> 00:20:18,733
- Thomas Searles.
- Captain.

200
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:22,989
So how was your meal?

201
00:20:23,053 --> 00:20:25,196
The remoulade was a trifle tart...

202
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,628
but the souffle for dessert
more than made up for it.

203
00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:29,548
And your comrades?

204
00:20:32,588 --> 00:20:35,340
Charming. Extraordinary
conversationalists, every one.

205
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:37,037
Major Forbes!

206
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,293
- A word, please.
- Oh, excuse me, Thomas.

207
00:20:46,317 --> 00:20:47,853
Yes, Robert?

208
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:50,925
l won't permit
that kind of fraternization.

209
00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:54,605
- lt's only Thomas.
- He's an enlisted man.

210
00:20:57,197 --> 00:20:58,734
You're right, of course.

211
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:01,806
I've sent for help.

212
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,013
These men need a proper teacher.

213
00:21:04,077 --> 00:21:08,398
For God's sake, you march like
a bunch of crippled old goats!

214
00:21:08,462 --> 00:21:10,670
We're gonna be here day and night
till we get this right!

215
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:14,158
One, one. Company, halt.

216
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:16,239
About-face!

217
00:21:16,303 --> 00:21:20,654
You are ugly Mexican-African
fucking whores!

218
00:21:20,718 --> 00:21:23,278
We're gonna work on this
day and night, gentlemen!

219
00:21:23,342 --> 00:21:25,870
Forward at the haIf step. March!

220
00:21:25,934 --> 00:21:28,686
One! You half-wit black bastard.

221
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,607
ls it true they cut your balls off
at birth?

222
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:34,286
l'll work on you
till l get you broken.

223
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,014
Company, halt!

224
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:38,542
Do you not know your right
from your left?

225
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:40,463
No, sir.

226
00:21:42,095 --> 00:21:44,430
How many here do not know
right from left?

227
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:48,975
Jesus, have pity.

228
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,767
This is your front!

229
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:53,936
This is your rear!
This is your right! And this--

230
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,423
Now you're learning, boy-o.

231
00:21:57,487 --> 00:22:00,079
Company, forward march!

232
00:22:00,143 --> 00:22:02,320
One!

233
00:22:02,384 --> 00:22:04,975
- Two!
- One! Two!

234
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:11,344
You bloody Hindus, get it right!

235
00:22:11,408 --> 00:22:15,248
Stop. Start it again.
ln each rank! Count!

236
00:22:16,784 --> 00:22:19,824
Left. Left, right, left!

237
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:21,967
Right, forward, march!

238
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:26,128
Left. Get your goddamn hand
out of your pocket!

239
00:22:29,488 --> 00:22:32,464
Bonny Prince Charlie!
Are you a gentleman?

240
00:22:32,528 --> 00:22:34,417
Are you a member of congress
or something?

241
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:36,528
Or are you the bloody
prince of Africa?

242
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:38,864
Don't look at me!
Look straight ahead!

243
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:40,784
l'll heat your ass up, boy-o!

244
00:22:40,848 --> 00:22:44,369
The lrish are not noted
for their fondness for the coloreds.

245
00:22:44,433 --> 00:22:46,544
What about the uniforms?

246
00:22:46,608 --> 00:22:49,009
Still no word.

247
00:22:49,073 --> 00:22:50,928
Rifles?

248
00:22:52,785 --> 00:22:54,321
See to it.

249
00:22:54,385 --> 00:22:57,778
You're a big buck, aren't you?
You've got a lot to learn!

250
00:22:57,842 --> 00:23:00,466
You haven't had a master like me!

251
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,953
<i>''Dear Mother.
The men learn very quickly.</i>

252
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:06,737
<i>Faster than white troops,
it seems to me.</i>

253
00:23:06,801 --> 00:23:09,681
<i>They are almost grave
and sedate under instruction...</i>

254
00:23:09,745 --> 00:23:12,146
<i>and they restrain themselves.</i>

255
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:15,921
<i>But the moment they are dismissed
from drill...</i>

256
00:23:15,985 --> 00:23:20,786
<i>every tongue is relaxed
and every ivory tooth is visible...</i>

257
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,049
<i>and you would not know from the sound
of it that this is an army camp.</i>

258
00:23:25,585 --> 00:23:29,746
<i>They must have learned this from long
hours of meaningless, inhuman work...</i>

259
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,665
<i>to set their minds free so quickly.</i>

260
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,995
<i>It gives them great energy.</i>

261
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:37,329
<i>There is no doubt
that we will leave this state...</i>

262
00:23:37,393 --> 00:23:40,242
<i>as fine a regiment
as any that has marched.</i>

263
00:23:40,306 --> 00:23:43,122
<i>As ever, your son, Robert."</i>

264
00:23:48,307 --> 00:23:50,162
They've done it.

265
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,251
Assemble the men.

266
00:23:55,315 --> 00:23:55,347
Attention!

267
00:23:55,347 --> 00:23:57,170
Attention!

268
00:23:58,578 --> 00:24:00,434
BattaIion!

269
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:08,978
ln accordance with
President Lincoln's wishes...

270
00:24:10,004 --> 00:24:11,858
you men are advised...

271
00:24:11,922 --> 00:24:16,307
that the Confederate Congress
has issued a proclamation.

272
00:24:18,484 --> 00:24:20,531
lt reads:

273
00:24:21,396 --> 00:24:24,532
''Any Negro taken in arms...

274
00:24:24,595 --> 00:24:27,412
against the Confederacy...

275
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:31,284
will immediately be returned
to a state of slavery.

276
00:24:33,876 --> 00:24:37,428
Any Negro taken in Federal uniform...

277
00:24:37,492 --> 00:24:40,627
will be summarily put to death.

278
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:49,620
Any white officer taken
in command of Negro troops...

279
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,028
shall be deemed as inciting
servile insurrection...

280
00:24:55,989 --> 00:24:58,677
and shall likewise be put to death.''

281
00:25:04,757 --> 00:25:08,629
Full discharges will be granted
in the morning...

282
00:25:08,693 --> 00:25:10,549
to all those who apply.

283
00:25:14,357 --> 00:25:16,117
Dismissed.

284
00:25:19,446 --> 00:25:21,300
lt you're not here in the morning...

285
00:25:22,358 --> 00:25:24,180
l understand.

286
00:25:32,117 --> 00:25:34,261
Still want that blue suit, nigger?

287
00:26:51,352 --> 00:26:54,840
- Good morning, Major.
- Sir! Formed and ready, sir.

288
00:26:54,903 --> 00:26:56,759
How many are left?

289
00:27:00,728 --> 00:27:02,583
Attention!

290
00:27:03,864 --> 00:27:05,721
Battalion!

291
00:27:23,097 --> 00:27:25,208
Glory hallelujah.

292
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:32,057
Company, halt!

293
00:27:36,952 --> 00:27:39,417
You're not dismissed, boy-o!
Get up!

294
00:27:39,481 --> 00:27:44,185
You'll fall out when l say
and not before. Understand? Get up!

295
00:27:45,592 --> 00:27:47,449
Sergeant Major.

296
00:27:55,002 --> 00:27:57,209
- Sir!
- At ease, Sergeant.

297
00:28:01,178 --> 00:28:03,706
l have no doubt
that you are a fair man, Mulcany.

298
00:28:06,265 --> 00:28:08,601
l wonder if you are
treating these men too hard.

299
00:28:11,034 --> 00:28:12,795
You disagree.

300
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:18,011
- You may speak freely.
- The boy's your friend, is he?

301
00:28:18,075 --> 00:28:19,962
We grew up together, yes.

302
00:28:21,562 --> 00:28:23,674
Let him grow up some more.

303
00:28:26,266 --> 00:28:28,603
- l see.
- Will that be all, sir?

304
00:28:33,434 --> 00:28:35,226
Dismissed.

305
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:56,955
.57 caliber Enfield rifle musket.
Best in the world here, boy.

306
00:28:57,019 --> 00:28:58,492
Sharts.

307
00:28:58,556 --> 00:29:00,603
One, one, nine, one, one.

308
00:29:01,628 --> 00:29:03,324
Can you handle that?

309
00:29:03,388 --> 00:29:05,243
l can knock something down
with this.

310
00:29:05,307 --> 00:29:06,683
Trip.

311
00:29:07,644 --> 00:29:10,140
One, two, one, nine, two.

312
00:29:10,204 --> 00:29:13,404
- Beautiful.
- Hawkins.

313
00:29:13,468 --> 00:29:16,445
One, two, one, eight, six.

314
00:29:16,508 --> 00:29:18,812
- Jefterson.
- Yes, sir!

315
00:29:18,876 --> 00:29:20,732
Robert.

316
00:29:21,981 --> 00:29:25,436
Finally.
There's a rumor going around...

317
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,029
that we're to be used
only for manual labor.

318
00:29:28,092 --> 00:29:29,948
l can't believe the things we hear.

319
00:29:32,796 --> 00:29:36,157
lt's not true, is it? I mean,
about not being allowed to fight.

320
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:38,141
The men are living for that day.

321
00:29:38,204 --> 00:29:40,060
l know l am.

322
00:29:43,037 --> 00:29:45,661
- Fletch.
- Don't bother about him.

323
00:29:45,725 --> 00:29:48,477
- He's just ignorant.
- Excuse me.

324
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,926
For God's sake, come on!

325
00:30:18,238 --> 00:30:21,214
- Good shot!
- Do that again!

326
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,934
Give him your weapon.
Do that again.

327
00:30:23,998 --> 00:30:27,837
- One dime he can't do it.
- Dime on each of you!

328
00:30:27,901 --> 00:30:30,333
That's a bet!
Go on, boy.

329
00:30:30,397 --> 00:30:32,350
Go ahead, Sharts.

330
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:40,862
- That's a dime on each of you!
- Double or nofhing!

331
00:30:44,062 --> 00:30:45,919
Attention, company!

332
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:49,246
Attention, company!

333
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,679
As you were.

334
00:30:51,743 --> 00:30:53,598
Front and center.

335
00:30:58,431 --> 00:31:00,384
You are a good shot, Private.

336
00:31:00,448 --> 00:31:02,622
Thank you, sir.
Squirrel hunting.

337
00:31:04,383 --> 00:31:07,934
- You ever killed a man?
- No, sir.

338
00:31:07,998 --> 00:31:10,367
- But you're handy with a gun.
- Yes, sir.

339
00:31:12,735 --> 00:31:14,592
Reload.

340
00:31:21,183 --> 00:31:23,040
Faster.

341
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,911
Faster.

342
00:31:33,088 --> 00:31:35,520
Discharge your weapon.

343
00:31:36,671 --> 00:31:38,752
Discharge your weapon.

344
00:31:39,615 --> 00:31:42,016
Do it!

345
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:46,273
Now, do it again. Only this time,
l want it done quickly.

346
00:31:48,928 --> 00:31:52,257
A good man can fire three aimed shots
in a minute.

347
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,697
Major Forbes, give me
your Colt revolver.

348
00:31:57,761 --> 00:31:59,617
- What?
- Your gun.

349
00:32:00,801 --> 00:32:02,657
Give it to me.

350
00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:08,417
Faster.

351
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,337
Reload.

352
00:32:11,424 --> 00:32:13,281
Quickly. Faster!

353
00:32:15,586 --> 00:32:17,858
Faster! Load.

354
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,169
Do it! Do it!

355
00:32:42,146 --> 00:32:44,930
Teach them properly, Major.

356
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,377
Yes, sir.

357
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:53,954
Attention, company!

358
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:58,819
Ready!

359
00:32:58,883 --> 00:33:00,355
Aim!

360
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:02,402
Fire!

361
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:23,203
Good morning, Major.
You're up early.

362
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,315
l want to talk to you.

363
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:27,236
Certainly.

364
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:31,779
lf you wouldn't mind
getting down from your horse.

365
00:33:44,836 --> 00:33:48,932
- Better?
- Why do you treat the men this way?

366
00:33:52,004 --> 00:33:53,540
How should l treat them?

367
00:33:53,604 --> 00:33:56,228
Like men?

368
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:02,341
And what about Thomas?
Why are you so hard on him?

369
00:34:02,405 --> 00:34:07,364
He's not a very good soldier.
l'm getting these men ready for battle.

370
00:34:07,428 --> 00:34:11,045
Robert, they're already as good
as the Seventh ever was.

371
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:12,645
They march well.
They're disciplined.

372
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:14,788
- No thanks to you.
- l beg your pardon?

373
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,389
You heard me.

374
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:21,349
Who do you think you are,
acting the high-up colonel?

375
00:34:21,412 --> 00:34:26,181
You seem to forget l know you
and so does Thomas.

376
00:34:32,741 --> 00:34:35,557
lf you don't believe in
what we're doing here...

377
00:34:35,621 --> 00:34:37,509
maybe you shouldn't be part of it.

378
00:34:37,573 --> 00:34:40,166
Part of what?

379
00:34:40,229 --> 00:34:41,797
Huh?

380
00:34:41,861 --> 00:34:47,270
Left, right! Little finger
along the seams of your trousers?

381
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:50,246
Marching is probably all
they'll ever get to do, Robert.

382
00:34:51,781 --> 00:34:54,630
lt is my job...

383
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:57,478
to get these men ready.

384
00:34:57,541 --> 00:35:00,198
And l will.

385
00:35:00,262 --> 00:35:04,518
They have risked their lives to be here.
They have given up their freedom.

386
00:35:04,582 --> 00:35:09,063
l owe them as much as they have given.
l owe them my freedom...

387
00:35:09,126 --> 00:35:10,661
my life, if necessary.

388
00:35:11,335 --> 00:35:13,605
Maybe so do you, Cabot.

389
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:16,166
l think you do.

390
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,550
Develop! En garde.

391
00:35:28,615 --> 00:35:30,471
Thrust! Develop!

392
00:35:34,983 --> 00:35:37,094
You're not at dancing school!
Take his head off!

393
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,726
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
What have we here?

394
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,767
Bonny Prince Charlie
and his toy bayonet.

395
00:35:45,831 --> 00:35:49,192
You're not reading now.
Go on. Get over!

396
00:35:50,503 --> 00:35:52,040
- Now stab me.
- What?

397
00:35:52,104 --> 00:35:54,023
Stab me.

398
00:35:55,847 --> 00:35:59,496
Come on. Stab! Not tickle.
Hit me!

399
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,472
Come on! You prissy schoolgirl!

400
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:04,648
You're the worst soldier
in this company! Hit me!

401
00:36:15,624 --> 00:36:17,704
No shame, son. Get up.

402
00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:23,432
- l said get up!
- Nigger forgot to duck. That's all.

403
00:36:24,456 --> 00:36:26,889
Sergeant, deal with that man.

404
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,296
l'll tell you a wee secret, son.
Learn to keep your mouth shut.

405
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:42,249
Save it, son.
Save it.

406
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:46,472
Carry on, Sergeant Mulcany.

407
00:36:46,536 --> 00:36:48,361
Robert.

408
00:36:49,866 --> 00:36:54,185
l'd like to speak to you
for a moment in private, it l may.

409
00:36:56,681 --> 00:37:01,642
Enlisted men wishing to speak
to their commanding officer...

410
00:37:01,706 --> 00:37:03,561
must first get permission.

411
00:37:04,841 --> 00:37:06,377
You understand, Private?

412
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:12,041
Yes, sir.

413
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:17,610
En garde! Thrust! Develop! Recover!

414
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:29,130
You better put some oomph
into that, boy-o!

415
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,218
Oh, my, my, my.

416
00:37:38,282 --> 00:37:40,523
Some things never change.

417
00:37:40,587 --> 00:37:43,403
l guess the whole world
hate the nigger.

418
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:45,835
Boy, if you don't quit
that drumming in here--

419
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:50,251
Honey, why don't you take your drum
on outside and practice?

420
00:37:53,098 --> 00:37:56,556
That Colonel Shaw, he a hard man.

421
00:37:57,963 --> 00:38:00,747
He a swell.
Just a nigger-beating swell.

422
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:03,403
But he in the same boat
with us.

423
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:06,571
Secess' come, take him, kill him too.

424
00:38:06,635 --> 00:38:08,555
Huh. Not him.

425
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,251
He a swell.

426
00:38:11,148 --> 00:38:12,907
He just a boy.

427
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:17,163
He a weak white boy.

428
00:38:17,227 --> 00:38:19,883
Beating on a nigger
make him feel strong.

429
00:38:21,483 --> 00:38:23,340
Ain't that right, snowflake?

430
00:38:25,292 --> 00:38:28,332
You know, he ain't never been
to no West Point.

431
00:38:28,397 --> 00:38:32,204
Onliest reason he in charge
is 'cause his mommy and daddy fixed it.

432
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,125
Ain't that so?

433
00:38:41,996 --> 00:38:44,076
You thought he was different,
didn't you?

434
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,996
Hmm?

435
00:38:47,213 --> 00:38:49,068
What you think now?

436
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,860
You just thought you was so smart,
didn't you?

437
00:38:56,332 --> 00:38:59,084
You in the real school now, though,
ain't you?

438
00:39:00,653 --> 00:39:02,509
What you gonna do? Cry?

439
00:39:06,509 --> 00:39:10,317
Yeah. He sure enough learning now,
ain't he?

440
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,277
Attention, company!

441
00:39:15,341 --> 00:39:17,709
Forward, march!
Right face.

442
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:20,142
Oh, shit.

443
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:25,357
Man say there's a farm,
ain't but two or three miles from here.

444
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:31,277
Said the lady over there
give him biscuits and gravy.

445
00:39:33,677 --> 00:39:36,525
She said, if he bring his friends,
she feed them too.

446
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:40,366
- Don't even think about it.
- What you say, Buck?

447
00:39:40,431 --> 00:39:43,694
Biscuits and gravy sound good to me.
Maybe get myself some real shoes.

448
00:39:43,758 --> 00:39:47,470
l'm telling you, boy.
They find out, they liable to shoot you.

449
00:39:47,534 --> 00:39:50,318
Nigger, is you a old man or old woman?
l forget.

450
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,326
All right.

451
00:39:57,871 --> 00:39:59,726
Collard greens.

452
00:40:03,022 --> 00:40:04,879
Corn bread.

453
00:40:09,935 --> 00:40:11,887
Come on. Dream.

454
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:15,023
l'm waiting on you.

455

- Oh, very well. Thank you.

That's all right. Brass are all up

You're among friends.

Oh, you're misinformed.
We haven't had a single incident.

482
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,755
l figure the nigs never had it so good.

483
00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:47,187
Three square a day,
a roof over their heads.

484
00:42:47,251 --> 00:42:50,643
They gotta know nobody's
gonna let them fight. Am l right?

485
00:42:52,724 --> 00:42:54,260
Yes, of course.

486
00:42:55,284 --> 00:42:57,140
lt there's anything you need--

487
00:42:57,204 --> 00:42:59,091
a bottle for the cold nights--

488
00:42:59,155 --> 00:43:02,900
Actually, l put in a requisition
for shoes two weeks ago...

489
00:43:02,964 --> 00:43:04,723
and l haven't heard anything.

490
00:43:04,787 --> 00:43:07,060
Well, provisionally speaking...

491
00:43:07,124 --> 00:43:10,323
we're extremely limited as to footwear.

492
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:12,340
That kind of item has to be reserved...

493
00:43:12,404 --> 00:43:15,604
for those units
whose fighting readiness...

494
00:43:15,668 --> 00:43:18,548
supersede yours.

495
00:43:18,612 --> 00:43:19,989
You understand.

496
00:43:23,221 --> 00:43:25,076
Yes, l understand.

497
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,581
- Excuse me.
- Stop by tomorrow.

498
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:38,421
l have got the most delicious
local jam. Myrtle berry, isn't it?

499
00:43:38,485 --> 00:43:41,013
- Blueberry.
- Right, right.

500
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:42,740
Nice meeting you, Shaw.

501
00:43:47,285 --> 00:43:49,142
Twit.

502
00:43:56,629 --> 00:43:58,933
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it?

503
00:43:58,997 --> 00:44:01,942
We've caught a deserter.

504
00:44:15,638 --> 00:44:18,582
Oh, Lordy, this is bad.

505
00:44:18,646 --> 00:44:20,823
They ain't gonna shoot him, is they?

506
00:44:22,518 --> 00:44:24,374
lt'll be all right...

507
00:44:24,438 --> 00:44:26,134
won't it?

508
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,910
Re-form your ranks!

509
00:44:29,974 --> 00:44:32,503
- Re-form your ranks!
- Form your ranks!

510
00:44:33,622 --> 00:44:35,479
Fall in.
Quiet in the ranks.

511
00:44:37,526 --> 00:44:39,159
Quiet in the ranks!

512
00:44:40,182 --> 00:44:42,263
Untie his hands
and take off his coat.

513
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:47,095
The prisoner is in position, sir.

514
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:49,238
What is this?

515
00:44:49,303 --> 00:44:52,118
The prisoner is to be flogged
before the entire regiment.

516
00:44:52,182 --> 00:44:54,454
Robert, not with a whip.
Not on them.

517
00:44:56,471 --> 00:44:59,863
- Excuse us, Sergeant Mulcany.
- At your pleasure, Colonel.

518
00:45:03,768 --> 00:45:07,895
Never question my authority
in front of ofhers.

519
00:45:07,959 --> 00:45:09,976
WeIl, l is sorry, massa.

520
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,112
You be the boss man now,
and all us chilluns must learn to obey.

521
00:45:13,175 --> 00:45:16,311
Major Forbes, stand at attention!

522
00:45:24,984 --> 00:45:26,231
Sergeant Mulcany.

523
00:45:29,591 --> 00:45:31,128
You may commence.

524
00:45:46,424 --> 00:45:47,801
Proceed.

525
00:47:11,675 --> 00:47:13,530
Attention.

526
00:47:23,995 --> 00:47:25,852
Mr. Rawlins.

527
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,396
This morning l--

528
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,891
lt would be a great help
if l could talk to you...

529
00:47:36,956 --> 00:47:39,259
about the men from time to time.

530
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,021
That's all.

531
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,412
Shoes, sir.

532
00:48:02,844 --> 00:48:04,509
The men need shoes.

533
00:48:04,573 --> 00:48:07,965
l know. l've been after
the quartermaster for some time.

534
00:48:08,028 --> 00:48:09,885
Now, sir. Now.

535
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:16,381
The boy was off trying to find hisself
some shoes, Colonel.

536
00:48:17,725 --> 00:48:20,477
He wants to fight...

537
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:23,004
same as the rest of us.

538
00:48:23,774 --> 00:48:25,660
More, even.

539
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:40,574
All of the men, like this?

540
00:48:40,638 --> 00:48:42,494
Yes, sir. Most of them.

541
00:48:57,757 --> 00:48:59,166
Good atternoon, Colonel.

542
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:01,694
Change your mind about that bottle?

543
00:49:01,758 --> 00:49:05,566
l want 600 pair of shoes
and 1,200 pair of socks...

544
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:08,158
and anything else
you've been holding out on us.

545
00:49:08,222 --> 00:49:11,166
- You piece of rat fiIth.
- l'd love to help you.

546
00:49:11,231 --> 00:49:14,111
- But we just don't have any.
- Not for niggers, you don't.

547
00:49:14,175 --> 00:49:17,662
- Not for anybody.
- l see. Pity.

548
00:49:17,726 --> 00:49:20,702
l'll just look and see
that you haven't misplaced them.

549
00:49:26,654 --> 00:49:28,447
Son of a bitch!

550
00:49:28,511 --> 00:49:31,647
- Damn it! You can't--
- Can't l?

551
00:49:31,711 --> 00:49:34,687
l'm a colonel, nasty little cuss.

552
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:38,207
You really think you can keep
700 Union soldiers...

553
00:49:38,271 --> 00:49:40,543
without proper shoes
because you think it's funny?

554
00:49:41,376 --> 00:49:43,232
Where would that power come from?

555
00:49:43,296 --> 00:49:45,375
All right. Calm down.

556
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,304
Look, have a drink.

557
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:03,424
Hey, you barefoot men!

558
00:50:03,488 --> 00:50:05,696
Get over here!

559
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,521
Shoes!

560
00:50:07,585 --> 00:50:09,439
Have a pair.

561
00:50:09,503 --> 00:50:13,409
Here's a pair there.
One pair of shoes here.

562
00:50:13,473 --> 00:50:16,513
Here's another pair.
One pair per customer.

563
00:50:51,937 --> 00:50:54,913
Steward, is there anything you need?

564
00:50:54,977 --> 00:50:57,281
- No, sir.
- Keep me informed.

565
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,394
Yes, sir. l will.

566
00:51:06,658 --> 00:51:08,994
Shoulder arms!

567
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:11,106
Sir.

568
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,051
From the War Department.

569
00:51:22,627 --> 00:51:24,482
Can anything be done?

570
00:51:26,242 --> 00:51:29,218
- They've got families.
- l know.

571
00:51:29,282 --> 00:51:32,002
We'll protest this
through channels later on.

572
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:35,715
- Attention, battalion.
- Yes, sir.

573
00:51:37,634 --> 00:51:40,291
Attention, battalion!

574
00:51:44,739 --> 00:51:48,098
You men enIisted in this regiment...

575
00:51:48,162 --> 00:51:50,179
on the understanding...

576
00:51:50,243 --> 00:51:53,730
that you would be paid
the regular army wage...

577
00:51:53,794 --> 00:51:55,651
of $13 a month.

578
00:51:56,611 --> 00:51:58,979
This morning l have been notified...

579
00:51:59,043 --> 00:52:03,268
that since you are a colored regiment,
you will be paid $10 a month.

580
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:06,883
That ain't fair.
They said 13.

581
00:52:06,947 --> 00:52:09,252
Regiment, fall out
by company to receive pay.

582
00:52:12,515 --> 00:52:15,652
- Where you going, boy?
- To get paid.

583
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,572
Ten dollar a lof of money.

584
00:52:19,268 --> 00:52:22,340
Hey, pop, you titting to lay down
for this too?

585
00:52:23,972 --> 00:52:26,629
Fall in!

586
00:52:29,477 --> 00:52:32,708
Hey. Come on.
Where's your pride, now?

587
00:52:32,772 --> 00:52:34,917
Make your mark right here.

588
00:52:34,981 --> 00:52:36,516
l can write my name.

589
00:52:36,581 --> 00:52:39,365
- Then do it.
- They gonna give us but ten?

590
00:52:39,429 --> 00:52:41,444
You gonna go for that?

591
00:52:41,508 --> 00:52:44,645
A coIored soldier stop a bullet
just as good as a white one!

592
00:52:44,709 --> 00:52:46,565
And for less money too!

593
00:52:46,629 --> 00:52:50,021
Yeah! Uncle Abe got hisself
a real bargain here!

594
00:52:50,085 --> 00:52:52,197
- What you say, boy?
- That's right, slaves!

595
00:52:52,261 --> 00:52:55,077
Make your mark.
Get your slave wages!

596
00:52:55,141 --> 00:52:57,444
All you good colored boys,
sign up.

597
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,365
That's right. Tear it up!

598
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:01,286
Tear it up!

599
00:53:37,573 --> 00:53:41,191
lf you men will take no pay...

600
00:53:41,255 --> 00:53:42,790
then none of us will.

601
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:52,038
Let's hear it for the colonel!

602
00:54:00,551 --> 00:54:04,070
Attention, battalion!

603
00:54:47,945 --> 00:54:50,697
Eyes right!

604
00:54:59,593 --> 00:55:01,001
Eyes front!

605
00:55:07,272 --> 00:55:09,129
Eyes...

606
00:55:10,376 --> 00:55:12,681
right.

607
00:56:33,227 --> 00:56:36,139
Man, l forgot how hot
it was down here.

608
00:56:36,203 --> 00:56:37,932
Welcome home, boy.

609
00:56:37,996 --> 00:56:41,163
Don't worry about it, buck.
Take a good look.

610
00:56:41,227 --> 00:56:43,788
lt's all a memory
now that the North man come.

611
00:56:43,852 --> 00:56:45,579
Now that we come.

612
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,756
Colonel Shaw?

613
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,972
Edward Pierce, special assignment
from Harper's Weekly.

614
00:56:53,036 --> 00:56:55,532
- Harper's Weekly?
- Serving an entire nation.

615
00:56:55,596 --> 00:56:59,979
A million loyal readers want to know
what happens when the 54th sees action.

616
00:57:00,043 --> 00:57:02,508
A million and one.

617
00:57:02,572 --> 00:57:05,356
Well, you'll want to see this.

618
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,164
Attention, company!

619
00:57:09,229 --> 00:57:11,916
- Rawlins, front and center.
- Sir!

620
00:57:14,253 --> 00:57:18,029
Mr. Rawlins, this regiment
was formed with the promise...

621
00:57:18,093 --> 00:57:21,229
that only white ofticers
would be commissioned to lead it.

622
00:57:21,293 --> 00:57:23,917
Nothing was mentioned, however,
about noncommissioned ofticers.

623
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:29,388
Therefore, in recognition ot initiative
taken not only for yourself...

624
00:57:29,453 --> 00:57:32,782
but on behalf
of the entire regiment...

625
00:57:32,846 --> 00:57:36,237
you are hereby awarded the rank
of sergeant major.

626
00:57:42,509 --> 00:57:44,206
Congratulations.

627
00:57:46,253 --> 00:57:48,109
- Thank you, sir.
- Hip, hip, hooray!

628
00:57:56,493 --> 00:57:58,542
Congratulations.

629
00:57:58,606 --> 00:58:01,902
l ain't sure
l'm wanting this, Colonel.

630
00:58:01,966 --> 00:58:04,302
I know exactly how you feeI.

631
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:17,806
Mama, they're coming home!
They're coming home!

632
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:35,502
That's right. Ain't no dream.

633
00:58:35,566 --> 00:58:38,158
We run away slaves,
but we come back fightin' men.

634
00:58:38,222 --> 00:58:41,839
Go tell your foIks how kingdom come
in the year of jubilee!

635
00:59:10,832 --> 00:59:13,039
Left! Up tight up there!

636
00:59:22,032 --> 00:59:26,096
- Who are these ragamuffin?
- Contrabands right out of the fields.

637
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,784
- Hey. Hey, old man, where from?
- Massachusetts.

638
00:59:28,848 --> 00:59:32,048
Oona march better than we.
Oona march like the buckra soldier.

639
00:59:32,112 --> 00:59:34,960
- I beg your pardon?
- He says we march like white soldiers.

640
00:59:35,024 --> 00:59:37,297
Even talk like the buckra soldier.

641
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,793
- Where you from?
- Oh, round about here.

642
00:59:39,857 --> 00:59:43,120
We were slaves in the field when
the Yankee man come. Say we soldiers.

643
00:59:43,184 --> 00:59:45,072
How you like the army, contraband?

644
00:59:45,136 --> 00:59:47,089
We love it.
We thank the Lord every day...

645
00:59:47,153 --> 00:59:49,393
for the good vittles
and these beautiful clothes.

646
00:59:49,457 --> 00:59:52,081
Tell true, old man.
This year, every day like Christmas.

647
00:59:52,145 --> 00:59:54,002
- Like what?
- Like Christmas.

648
00:59:57,745 --> 01:00:02,001
My country, 'tis of thee

649
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:06,130
Sweet land of liberty

650
01:00:06,194 --> 01:00:09,585
Of thee I sing

651
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:13,841
Land where my father died

652
01:00:13,905 --> 01:00:18,098
Land of the pilgrims' pride

653
01:00:18,162 --> 01:00:21,906
From every mountainside

654
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:25,393
Let freedom ring

655
01:00:29,331 --> 01:00:30,770
Splendid.

656
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:34,162
They've been working for weeks
in anticipation of your arrival.

657
01:00:34,226 --> 01:00:36,306
We're all very excited
to have you here, Shaw.

658
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:38,866
- Thank you, sir.
- Lincoln's idea.

659
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:43,315
Hired a group of New Englanders to teach
our colored how to read and write.

660
01:00:43,379 --> 01:00:46,834
Just your sort of people,
l should think.

661
01:00:46,898 --> 01:00:49,778
Your regiment should enjoy
their stay here.

662
01:00:49,842 --> 01:00:54,578
Yes, l'm sure we'll have a fine time,
but that's not why we're here.

663
01:00:54,643 --> 01:00:58,036
Yes, well, can't promise you
much action.

664
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:02,163
Just having the coloreds around seems to
have scared the bejesus out of the Rebs.

665
01:01:02,227 --> 01:01:04,563
- Colonel Shaw?
- Excuse me.

666
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:07,219
l'd like you to meet
some of our instructors.

667
01:01:07,283 --> 01:01:09,332
Dr. Thorpe of Salem.

668
01:01:09,396 --> 01:01:11,282
- lt's my pleasure, Colonel Shaw.
- A pleasure.

669
01:01:11,347 --> 01:01:13,843
Dr. Rogers of Philadelphia.

670
01:01:13,907 --> 01:01:17,555
- l know and admire your parents.
- You do, sir? Why, thank you, sir.

671
01:01:17,619 --> 01:01:21,523
Shaw, meet Colonel Montgomery.

672
01:01:21,587 --> 01:01:23,636
He's your brigade commander.

673
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,556
- Colonel.
- Honored, sir.

674
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:28,627
Colonel Montgomery's
a real jayhawker from Kansas.

675
01:01:28,691 --> 01:01:30,836
Contraband regiment
is his brainchild.

676
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:34,707
You didn't think yours were the only
coIoreds around, did you, Colonel?

677
01:01:34,771 --> 01:01:36,308
l did actually.

678
01:01:36,372 --> 01:01:40,275
Well, l'm sure they'll do just fine.
Have they seen any mischief?

679
01:01:40,339 --> 01:01:41,812
No, sir.

680
01:01:42,964 --> 01:01:45,652
l'm hiking a company over
to the Georgia coast in the morning.

681
01:01:45,716 --> 01:01:50,069
We'll be foraging for supplies.
l could use a hand.

682
01:01:50,133 --> 01:01:52,404
That is, it you think
your men are up to it.

683
01:01:54,261 --> 01:01:57,972
- They are indeed, sir.
- Good. Very good.

684
01:01:58,036 --> 01:02:00,500
- A pleasure.
- Good night.

685
01:02:00,564 --> 01:02:02,933
Beg to report, Colonel, sir.

686
01:02:03,828 --> 01:02:06,165
The troop is fed
and bedded down for the night, sir.

687
01:02:06,228 --> 01:02:09,236
Very good, Corporal.
Pass the word along to ''A'' Company.

688
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,445
We'll be going into action
in the morning.

689
01:02:14,133 --> 01:02:16,214
Very good, sir.

690
01:02:29,685 --> 01:02:31,958
Your men march handsomely, Colonel.
My compliments.

691
01:02:32,022 --> 01:02:33,398
Thank you, sir.

692
01:02:33,462 --> 01:02:36,565
l am surprised at how well
you handle them.

693
01:02:36,629 --> 01:02:38,485
See, l am from Kentucky originally.

694
01:02:38,549 --> 01:02:42,518
We owned a few ourselves,
so it comes naturally to me.

695
01:02:42,582 --> 01:02:46,422
- You are from Boston, are you not?
- Yes.

696
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:51,414
lt is impossible
to imagine Boston with slaves.

697
01:03:06,966 --> 01:03:09,431
Company, halt!

698
01:03:10,967 --> 01:03:14,008
- Halt!
- Shoulder arms!

699
01:03:14,072 --> 01:03:17,463
Town's clean, sir.
Ain't no Rebs here, just some women.

700
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:20,375
Well, all right!
You hear that, boys?

701
01:03:20,439 --> 01:03:22,392
Let's clear her out!

702
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:28,440
What are you doing?

703
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:30,936
Liberating this town
in the name of the Republic.

704
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,527
The musket, Massa Colonel?
Never shoot it. Shoot now?

705
01:03:33,591 --> 01:03:35,640
Yeah, l don't see why not.
Go ahead.

706
01:03:37,335 --> 01:03:39,448
Shoot the lady, boys!

707
01:03:42,456 --> 01:03:44,312
Don't shoot!
We ain't Secess' here!

708
01:03:44,376 --> 01:03:45,848
That man is a civilian.

709
01:03:45,911 --> 01:03:48,440
That man is Secess',
and Secess' is all the same, son.

710
01:03:53,912 --> 01:03:58,872
Look around. You really think anybody's
gonna put these boys into real combat?

711
01:03:59,897 --> 01:04:00,952
Do you?

712
01:04:03,033 --> 01:04:05,497
They're little children, for God's sake.
They're little monkey children.

713
01:04:05,561 --> 01:04:07,288
You just gotta know
how to control them.

714
01:04:11,896 --> 01:04:14,361
Please, let go! Oh, God!

715
01:04:15,417 --> 01:04:17,593
You see what l mean?
Children!

716
01:04:19,929 --> 01:04:23,833
- Animal! Leave her aIone!
- Hey, boy!

717
01:04:23,897 --> 01:04:25,336
Take your hands oft the white lady!

718
01:04:34,906 --> 01:04:37,722
That would not have been necessary
it that Secess' woman hadn't started it.

719
01:04:37,786 --> 01:04:40,378
They'll never learn.

720
01:04:40,442 --> 01:04:43,833
Secess' has got to be
swept away by the hand ot God...

721
01:04:43,897 --> 01:04:46,394
like the Jews of old.

722
01:04:46,458 --> 01:04:48,473
And now l'll have to burn this town.

723
01:04:49,945 --> 01:04:53,274
Nigger soldiers! Nigger soldiers!

724
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:58,394
TeIl your men to set torches
and prepare to fire the buildings.

725
01:04:58,458 --> 01:05:00,474
l will not.

726
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:04,122
That is an order.

727
01:05:04,186 --> 01:05:07,578
You will do it or face charges
for disobeying your superior officer.

728
01:05:07,642 --> 01:05:11,353
lt is an immoral order, and by articles
ot war l am not bound to obey it.

729
01:05:11,418 --> 01:05:14,202
Well, you can just explain that
at your court-marital...

730
01:05:15,546 --> 01:05:18,203
after your men
are placed under my command.

731
01:05:30,203 --> 01:05:32,955
First squad, second platoon.

732
01:05:33,019 --> 01:05:36,795
Fall out to set torches.
Prepare to fire the town.

733
01:05:36,859 --> 01:05:40,442
First squad, second platoon!
Fall out!

734
01:06:06,331 --> 01:06:08,636
Right face!

735
01:06:11,196 --> 01:06:13,884
Forward march!

736
01:06:13,948 --> 01:06:17,020
The colors, Sergeant Major.

737
01:06:17,084 --> 01:06:18,941
Change the colors.

738
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,076
What you lookin' at,
biscuit eaters?

739
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,860
You think you better than me?
You think you my judge?

740
01:06:24,924 --> 01:06:26,780
You ain't nothin'!

741
01:06:45,022 --> 01:06:47,196
<i>''Dear Father. l need your help.</i>

742
01:06:50,174 --> 01:06:52,733
<i>Despite my many requests,
it has become clear...</i>

743
01:06:52,797 --> 01:06:55,805
<i>that we are to be
used only for manual labor.</i>

744
01:06:58,269 --> 01:06:59,901
<i>Morale is low.</i>

745
01:06:59,965 --> 01:07:03,454
<i>The men 's good humor
darkened by idleness and despair.</i>

746
01:07:03,518 --> 01:07:07,966
<i>Why keep drilling if they're never given
the opportunity to prove themselves?"</i>

747
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:09,406
Attention!

748
01:07:11,422 --> 01:07:13,278
<i>''l have written to Governor Andrew...</i>

749
01:07:13,342 --> 01:07:15,677
<i>as well as to
the General Staff in Washington.</i>

750
01:07:15,741 --> 01:07:19,230
<i>But I feel that only a letter
directly from you to Lincoln himself...</i>

751
01:07:19,294 --> 01:07:21,533
<i>can have the desired effect.</i>

752
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:24,734
<i>I can think of no other course.</i>

753
01:07:27,101 --> 01:07:29,086
<i>I am sure you both pray,
as l do...</i>

754
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:31,103
<i>that all this
has not been in vain."</i>

755
01:07:31,167 --> 01:07:34,366
Look like we're goin' the wrong way.

756
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:37,758
Hey. Hey, come on now.
Buck up, boys!

757
01:07:37,822 --> 01:07:40,062
Hey, buck up now! Come on!

758
01:07:40,126 --> 01:07:42,974
Someday they're gonna
let the 54th get into it, see?

759
01:07:43,038 --> 01:07:44,894
And all your troubles
would be over, huh?

760
01:07:44,958 --> 01:07:47,710
Come on now. Cheer up! Hey!

761
01:07:48,735 --> 01:07:52,575
- What'd you say, boy?
- ''Boy''?

762
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:54,304
- Let me tell you--
- Shut up, Trip--

763
01:07:54,368 --> 01:07:56,574
Would you get up off me, snowflake?

764
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:00,863
See, let me explain
something to you.

765
01:08:00,927 --> 01:08:04,927
The way l figure, l figure this war
would be over a whole lot sooner...

766
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:08,224
it you boys just turn right on around
and head on back down that way...

767
01:08:08,288 --> 01:08:10,751
and you let us head on up there
where the real fightin' is.

768
01:08:10,815 --> 01:08:12,703
Them men dyin' up that road.

769
01:08:12,768 --> 01:08:16,319
lt wouldn't be nothin' but Rebs dying,
it they let the 54th in it.

770
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:17,823
- Listen--
- Hold it!

771
01:08:19,808 --> 01:08:22,303
As you were, Trip! As you were!

772
01:08:24,096 --> 01:08:25,952
You men move on.

773
01:08:26,016 --> 01:08:30,560
Stripes on a nigger.
That's like tits on a bull.

774
01:08:32,352 --> 01:08:35,680
You're lookin' at a higher rank,
Corporal. You'll obey and like it.

775
01:08:36,736 --> 01:08:38,464
- Make me.
- l'll make you.

776
01:08:40,001 --> 01:08:43,329
- What the hell is goin' on here?
- Attention!

777
01:08:43,393 --> 01:08:47,264
You! Yes, you. What's your name?
I'm putting you up on charges.

778
01:08:47,328 --> 01:08:50,081
- Ain't no cause for that, sir.
- What's that, Sergeant?

779
01:08:50,145 --> 01:08:53,984
It's just a soldiers' fight, sir.

780
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,744
- All right. You men move along.
- Front step! Forward! March!

781
01:08:59,808 --> 01:09:00,961
Move it!

782
01:09:01,729 --> 01:09:05,408
You men get back to work.
Back to work! Let's go!

783
01:09:05,472 --> 01:09:09,538
- We'll see you again.
- Go dig a latrine.

784
01:09:09,601 --> 01:09:11,585
Go strum a banjo, boy.

785
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:13,025
Come on.

786
01:09:16,929 --> 01:09:20,193
l've got the guard.
Let me use your looking glass.

787
01:09:22,977 --> 01:09:24,353
Thank you.

788
01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:28,641
Yeah, button up that collar.

789
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,969
Suck in that gut.

790
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:34,050
Tuck in them big black lips.

791
01:09:34,114 --> 01:09:36,898
Lighten your skin.
Shrink up that nose.

792
01:09:36,962 --> 01:09:39,298
l don't have to listen to this.

793
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:42,466
Where you goin', boy?

794
01:09:43,587 --> 01:09:47,234
- Let me by.
- Let you by?

795
01:09:47,298 --> 01:09:49,539
Let you by?

796
01:09:50,626 --> 01:09:52,931
Let me tell you something, boy.

797
01:09:52,994 --> 01:09:55,874
You can march like the white man.
You can talk like 'em.

798
01:09:55,938 --> 01:09:58,595
You can learn his songs.
You can even wear his suits.

799
01:09:58,659 --> 01:10:01,443
But you ain't never
gonna be nothin' to him...

800
01:10:01,507 --> 01:10:05,475
but an ugly-ass chimp
in a blue suit.

801
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:08,387
- Oh, you don't like that, do you?
- No.

802
01:10:10,691 --> 01:10:14,019
What we gonna do about it?
Want to fight me, boy?

803
01:10:14,083 --> 01:10:16,931
Huh? What you gonna
do about it?

804
01:10:19,075 --> 01:10:22,659
You want to fight me, don't you?
Don't you?

805
01:10:26,851 --> 01:10:28,900
- Come on, nig.
- All right! All right!

806
01:10:28,964 --> 01:10:30,595
Get your hands off me,
gravedigger.

807
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:32,932
Goddamn it. Does the whole world
gotta stomp in your face?

808
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:36,100
- Nigger, get your hands off me.
- Ain't no niggers here.

809
01:10:36,164 --> 01:10:38,435
So the white man give you
a couple of stripes...

810
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,835
next thing you know, you hollerin'
and orderin' everybody around...

811
01:10:40,899 --> 01:10:42,468
like you the massa himself.

812
01:10:42,532 --> 01:10:45,252
Nigger, you ain't nothin'
but the white man's dog.

813
01:10:47,332 --> 01:10:49,188
And what are you?

814
01:10:49,252 --> 01:10:51,908
So full of hate
you wanna fight everybody...

815
01:10:51,972 --> 01:10:54,276
'cause you've been whipped
and chased by hounds.

816
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:56,772
That might not be livin',
but it sure ain't dyin'.

817
01:10:56,836 --> 01:11:00,740
And dying's what these white boys
been doin' for goin' on three years now.

818
01:11:00,805 --> 01:11:04,100
Dyin' by the thousands.
Dyin' for you, fool!

819
01:11:04,164 --> 01:11:06,309
l know, 'cause l dug the graves.

820
01:11:06,373 --> 01:11:08,548
And all the time l'm diggin',
l'm asking myself, ''When?

821
01:11:08,612 --> 01:11:10,629
When, O Lord,
is it gonna be our time?''

822
01:11:11,813 --> 01:11:14,213
Time's comin' when
we're gonna have to ante up.

823
01:11:14,277 --> 01:11:17,733
Ante up and kick in like men.
Like men!

824
01:11:19,397 --> 01:11:21,284
You watch who you call a nigger.

825
01:11:21,348 --> 01:11:24,100
lt there's any niggers around here,
it's you.

826
01:11:24,164 --> 01:11:27,750
Smart-mouth, stupid-ass,
swamp-running nigger.

827
01:11:27,814 --> 01:11:29,988
lt you ain't careful,
that's all you ever gonna be.

828
01:11:33,702 --> 01:11:36,454
You men go on back to business.

829
01:11:58,566 --> 01:11:59,943
Ah, Shaw.

830
01:12:01,605 --> 01:12:02,983
Sit down.

831
01:12:08,838 --> 01:12:12,006
Well, Colonel,
what can l do for you?

832
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:16,582
You can give me and my regiment
a transter to combat command.

833
01:12:17,287 --> 01:12:19,142
Couldn't do it, Colonel.

834
01:12:19,206 --> 01:12:21,575
You're much too valuable
to my operations here.

835
01:12:34,696 --> 01:12:36,135
May l sit?

836
01:12:37,672 --> 01:12:39,815
Thank you. Major.

837
01:12:49,224 --> 01:12:51,207
l've written a letter
to my father...

838
01:12:52,391 --> 01:12:56,583
asking him to press Governor Andrew
and President Lincoln.

839
01:12:56,647 --> 01:12:58,952
But l don't have to wait
for all that, do l?

840
01:13:01,192 --> 01:13:04,872
Colonel Montgomery, would you
bring that ashtray over here?

841
01:13:08,231 --> 01:13:11,111
But valuable to your operations here,
do you say?

842
01:13:11,175 --> 01:13:14,376
Your foraging,
your depredations?

843
01:13:15,368 --> 01:13:18,888
Yes, l've become quite a student
of your operations in this region.

844
01:13:18,952 --> 01:13:21,896
Thirty-four mansions,
l think it was, pillaged and burned...

845
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:25,544
under Colonel Montgomery's expedition
of the Combahee.

846
01:13:25,608 --> 01:13:29,385
Four thousand bales of cotton
smuggled through the lines...

847
01:13:29,449 --> 01:13:31,432
with payment to parties unknown...

848
01:13:31,496 --> 01:13:33,929
except by you.

849
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:37,705
False quartermaster requisitions.
Major Forbes here has seen the copies.

850
01:13:37,769 --> 01:13:39,625
Yes, indeed.

851
01:13:39,689 --> 01:13:44,169
Along with confiscated valuables
shipped north as personal baggage.

852
01:13:45,545 --> 01:13:47,209
Shall l go on?

853
01:13:48,233 --> 01:13:49,674
Can you?

854
01:13:51,913 --> 01:13:54,761
l can report you
to the War Department.

855
01:13:55,785 --> 01:13:59,145
Oh, yes. l can do that.

856
01:14:06,634 --> 01:14:11,274
Let you take your regiment
out to fight?

857
01:14:13,578 --> 01:14:17,290
That's what you want, isn't it?
Show what they can do.

858
01:14:18,443 --> 01:14:21,547
- When?
- You are bright-eyed, aren't you?

859
01:14:21,611 --> 01:14:23,369
When?

860
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:29,418
Just as soon as
I can write the orders.

861
01:14:33,578 --> 01:14:34,954
Major.

862
01:14:46,283 --> 01:14:47,660
Double-quick!

863
01:14:53,643 --> 01:14:57,707
All right, company, in a line.
Double-quick!

864
01:14:57,771 --> 01:15:01,676
All right, men, form a firing line.
Over here.

865
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:04,331
Form a firing line right here!

866
01:15:15,819 --> 01:15:18,092
Front rank, kneel!

867
01:15:19,756 --> 01:15:21,291
Steady, boys!

868
01:15:25,644 --> 01:15:29,100
Firing by battalion!

869
01:15:30,797 --> 01:15:31,948
Aim!

870
01:15:32,972 --> 01:15:35,180
Charge!

871
01:15:35,244 --> 01:15:36,940
Fire!

872
01:15:44,204 --> 01:15:48,173
Cease fire! Recover!

873
01:16:07,533 --> 01:16:09,069
Here they come!

874
01:16:19,694 --> 01:16:22,221
- Reload!
- Reload! Load!

875
01:16:22,285 --> 01:16:25,774
- Load it! Load it!
- Quickly, men!

876
01:16:25,838 --> 01:16:28,141
- Ready!
- Ready!

877
01:16:29,422 --> 01:16:31,438
- Aim!
- Aim!

878
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:33,677
Get ready. Get ready!

879
01:16:33,741 --> 01:16:35,758
Fire!

880
01:16:45,486 --> 01:16:47,663
- Reload!
- Reload!

881
01:16:47,726 --> 01:16:49,678
Quickly!

882
01:16:49,742 --> 01:16:52,558
- Fire at will!
- Fire at will!

883
01:17:04,335 --> 01:17:05,775
Pour it in!

884
01:17:20,272 --> 01:17:21,871
Charge!

885
01:18:30,609 --> 01:18:33,425
Look out, boy! Look out!

886
01:18:50,802 --> 01:18:51,954
Fire!

887
01:19:04,499 --> 01:19:06,962
They're turnin' tail!

888
01:19:12,947 --> 01:19:14,579
Run, you Rebs!

889
01:19:23,954 --> 01:19:25,811
Deploy skirmishers, Captain.

890
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:29,139
Re-form your ranks!
Re-form your ranks!

891
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:45,204
Fall in! On the double!

892
01:19:47,379 --> 01:19:49,524
- Form Company.
- Thomas!

893
01:19:55,859 --> 01:19:57,588
How do, CoIonel?

894
01:19:58,995 --> 01:20:00,436
Hurts, doesn't it?

895
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:05,077
Well, l'm extremely jealous.

896
01:20:05,141 --> 01:20:08,405
You'll be back in Boston before me,
sitting by the fire...

897
01:20:08,469 --> 01:20:11,572
reading Hawthorne,
cup of decent coffee.

898
01:20:11,636 --> 01:20:13,268
l'm not going back.

899
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:19,348
Thomas, listen to me.
You're shot. You have to go back.

900
01:20:22,549 --> 01:20:26,036
Robert, promise me...

901
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:29,045
that you won't send me back.

902
01:20:31,765 --> 01:20:33,140
Promise me!

903
01:20:35,221 --> 01:20:39,156
All right. All right.

904
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:05,109
Colonel Shaw!

905
01:21:05,173 --> 01:21:07,286
- What is all this?
- You haven't heard?

906
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:10,614
Lee was turned back in Pennsylvania
at Gettysburg...

907
01:21:10,678 --> 01:21:13,813
now Grant's taken Vicksburg,
and all on the Fourth of July.

908
01:21:13,877 --> 01:21:15,734
- My God!
- Yeah!

909
01:21:15,798 --> 01:21:18,390
lt looks like it'll all be over
by Christmas.

910
01:21:18,454 --> 01:21:20,982
- So, how did they do?
- SpIendid. Just splendid.

911
01:21:21,046 --> 01:21:23,511
- Any casualties?
- Forty-two.

912
01:21:23,575 --> 01:21:26,519
Give me the details.
l'll wire it in.

913
01:21:26,583 --> 01:21:28,630
l don't think we got
a prayer of making the paper.

914
01:21:28,694 --> 01:21:30,775
l'll talk to you later
in your tent.

915
01:21:46,616 --> 01:21:48,534
As you were.

916
01:21:53,431 --> 01:21:57,047
- Trip, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

917
01:21:58,423 --> 01:22:01,655
You fought very well
yesterday, Trip.

918
01:22:01,719 --> 01:22:06,071
Sergeant Rawlins has recommended
that you receive a commendation.

919
01:22:06,135 --> 01:22:08,024
Yes, sir?

920
01:22:08,088 --> 01:22:11,927
Yes, and l think you should bear
the regimental colors.

921
01:22:15,641 --> 01:22:17,207
Well--

922
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:19,832
lt's considered quite an honor.

923
01:22:23,865 --> 01:22:24,952
Why not?

924
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:32,825
Well, l'm...

925
01:22:35,353 --> 01:22:38,008
wantin' to say somethin', sir,
but l--

926
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:41,209
Go ahead.

927
01:22:43,704 --> 01:22:45,881
AIl right. See--

928
01:22:48,889 --> 01:22:53,785
l ain't fightin' this war
for you, sir.

929
01:22:55,513 --> 01:22:56,889
l see.

930
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:01,402
l mean, what's the point?

931
01:23:01,466 --> 01:23:03,544
Ain't nobody gonna win.
lt's just gonna go on and on.

932
01:23:03,609 --> 01:23:06,266
- It can't go on forever.
- But ain't nobody gonna win.

933
01:23:06,329 --> 01:23:08,185
Somebody's gonna win.

934
01:23:10,362 --> 01:23:12,537
Who?

935
01:23:12,601 --> 01:23:17,210
l mean, you get to go on back
to Boston to a big house and all that.

936
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:22,522
What about us?
What do we get?

937
01:23:27,803 --> 01:23:29,785
Well, you won't get anything
if we lose.

938
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:38,586
What do you want to do?

939
01:23:40,538 --> 01:23:41,915
l don't know, sir.

940
01:23:43,835 --> 01:23:45,370
lt stinks, l suppose.

941
01:23:45,434 --> 01:23:49,275
Yeah, it stinks bad.

942
01:23:49,339 --> 01:23:52,794
And we all covered up in it.
Ain't nobody clean.

943
01:23:58,682 --> 01:24:01,402
Be nice to get clean though.

944
01:24:02,971 --> 01:24:04,506
How do we do that?

945
01:24:10,331 --> 01:24:13,051
We ante up and kick in, sir.

946
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:18,715
But l still don't
wanna carry your flag.

947
01:24:23,483 --> 01:24:25,372
No one will ever take Charleston
without first...

948
01:24:25,436 --> 01:24:28,252
silencing the forts
which protect its harbor.

949
01:24:28,316 --> 01:24:32,380
And the first one that must
be taken is that, Fort Wagner.

950
01:24:34,972 --> 01:24:37,372
Wagner mounts a ten-inch Columbiad...

951
01:24:37,436 --> 01:24:39,997
three smoothbore 32-pounders...

952
01:24:40,061 --> 01:24:42,332
a 42-pound Carronade...

953
01:24:42,396 --> 01:24:47,196
a 10-inch Coast Mortar
and four 12-pound Howitzers...

954
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:50,588
plus a garrison
of about a thousand men.

955
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:53,085
As many of you gentlemen
may be aware...

956
01:24:53,149 --> 01:24:56,316
for the last four days
our navy has weakened Wagner...

957
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:58,333
with a constant barrage.

958
01:24:58,397 --> 01:25:01,693
Headquarters has determined a time
for our attack.

959
01:25:01,757 --> 01:25:07,165
We will proceed with a direct
frontal assault tomorrow at dusk.

960
01:25:07,229 --> 01:25:10,589
The problem, gentlemen,
is the approach.

961
01:25:10,652 --> 01:25:13,149
The ocean and the marsh
leave only a narrow strip of sand...

962
01:25:13,213 --> 01:25:17,278
a natural defile, through which we can
only send one regiment at a time.

963
01:25:17,342 --> 01:25:20,733
Our best hope is that that leading
regiment can keep the Rebs occupied...

964
01:25:20,797 --> 01:25:24,093
long enough for reinforcements
to exploit the breach.

965
01:25:24,157 --> 01:25:29,597
Needless to say, casualties
in the leading regiment may be extreme.

966
01:25:30,941 --> 01:25:32,317
General Strong.

967
01:25:34,846 --> 01:25:37,213
The 54th Massachusetts...

968
01:25:37,277 --> 01:25:40,189
requests the honor of leading
the attack on Fort Wagner.

969
01:25:49,375 --> 01:25:51,229
lt's Colonel Shaw, isn't it?

970
01:25:51,903 --> 01:25:53,278
Yes, sir.

971
01:25:54,205 --> 01:25:56,478
You and your men
haven't slept for two days.

972
01:25:58,239 --> 01:25:59,615
That's right, sir.

973
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:02,174
And you think they have the strength
to lead this charge?

974
01:26:06,495 --> 01:26:09,439
There's more to fighting
than rest, sir.

975
01:26:10,463 --> 01:26:12,543
There's character.

976
01:26:13,567 --> 01:26:15,551
There's strength of heart.

977
01:26:18,879 --> 01:26:23,038
You should have seen us
in action two days ago.

978
01:26:23,102 --> 01:26:25,279
We were a sight to see.

979
01:26:28,223 --> 01:26:30,079
We'll be ready, sir.

980
01:26:31,423 --> 01:26:33,311
When do you want us?

981
01:26:51,839 --> 01:26:55,231
O Lord, O Lord

982
01:26:55,295 --> 01:26:58,433
Lord, Lord, Lord

983
01:27:01,697 --> 01:27:04,673
He packed in the animals
two by two

984
01:27:04,737 --> 01:27:07,329
An ox, a camel and a kangaroo

985
01:27:07,393 --> 01:27:09,857
Packed them in that ark so tight

986
01:27:09,921 --> 01:27:12,961
l couldn't get no sleep that night

987
01:27:13,025 --> 01:27:15,392
Grown-up sons
Shem and Ham

988
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:17,569
Tell me about God's master plan

989
01:27:19,009 --> 01:27:24,289
O my Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord

990
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:47,810
- Tomorrow we goin' to battle.
- All right.

991
01:27:47,874 --> 01:27:52,354
So, Lordy, let me fight
with the rifle in one hand...

992
01:27:52,418 --> 01:27:54,370
and the Good Book in the other.

993
01:27:54,434 --> 01:27:56,994
- Yeah!
- Amen!

994
01:27:58,210 --> 01:28:03,330
That if l should die
at the muzzle of the rifle...

995
01:28:03,394 --> 01:28:08,067
die on water or on land...

996
01:28:08,131 --> 01:28:13,282
l may know that You,
blessed Jesus Almighty, are with me.

997
01:28:13,346 --> 01:28:15,010
With Jesus!

998
01:28:17,154 --> 01:28:20,162
And l have no fear. Amen.

999
01:28:21,954 --> 01:28:26,595
O my Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord

1000
01:28:39,010 --> 01:28:43,203
Lord, we stand before You
this evenin'...

1001
01:28:43,267 --> 01:28:45,732
to say thank you.

1002
01:28:45,796 --> 01:28:49,251
We thank You, Father,
for Your grace...

1003
01:28:49,315 --> 01:28:51,779
and Your many blessings.

1004
01:28:51,843 --> 01:28:54,116
Now, l run off...

1005
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:58,692
and left all my young'uns
and my kinfolk in bondage.

1006
01:28:58,756 --> 01:29:01,859
So l'm standing here this evening,
Heavenly Father...

1007
01:29:01,923 --> 01:29:06,564
to ask Your blessings
on all of us...

1008
01:29:06,628 --> 01:29:11,268
so that if tomorrow
is our great getting-up mornin'...

1009
01:29:11,332 --> 01:29:15,172
if tomorrow we have to meet
the Judgment Day...

1010
01:29:15,236 --> 01:29:18,692
O Heavenly Father,
we want You to let our foIks know...

1011
01:29:18,756 --> 01:29:20,644
that we died facin' the enemy.

1012
01:29:22,083 --> 01:29:24,900
We want 'em to know
that we went down standin' up--

1013
01:29:24,964 --> 01:29:26,500
Yes, Lord!

1014
01:29:26,564 --> 01:29:29,924
among those that are fightin'
against our oppression!

1015
01:29:29,988 --> 01:29:33,573
We want 'em to know, Heavenly Father,
that we died for freedom.

1016
01:29:36,101 --> 01:29:39,524
We ask these blessings
in Jesus' name. Amen!

1017
01:29:52,773 --> 01:29:55,781
- Trip! Come on!
- No, l ain't--

1018
01:29:55,845 --> 01:29:57,766
You better get
your butt up there, boy.

1019
01:29:57,830 --> 01:30:01,445
Just say what you think.
Just say what you feel. Go on now.

1020
01:30:01,509 --> 01:30:05,062
- Come on.
- Preach it, brother.

1021
01:30:06,758 --> 01:30:08,997
Go on. Let it out.

1022
01:30:10,245 --> 01:30:14,309
l ain't much
about no prayin' now.

1023
01:30:17,509 --> 01:30:21,223
l ain't never had no family and...

1024
01:30:25,126 --> 01:30:27,558
killed off my mama.

1025
01:30:30,822 --> 01:30:32,679
This feels funny.

1026
01:30:32,743 --> 01:30:34,726
- Come on.
- lt's all right.

1027
01:30:36,358 --> 01:30:38,567
Come on now.
You're doin' fine.

1028
01:30:43,174 --> 01:30:44,902
Well, l just--

01:30:52,358 --> 01:30:54,790
You know, y'all's-- y'all's--

1030
01:30:56,903 --> 01:30:58,760
Y'all's the onliest family l got.

1031
01:30:58,824 --> 01:31:01,576
WeIl, that's aIl right.

1032
01:31:02,663 --> 01:31:04,040
And, uh--

1033
01:31:08,743 --> 01:31:11,559
- l love the 54th.
- All right.

1034
01:31:20,104 --> 01:31:24,616
Ain't much matter what happens tomorrow,
'cause we men, ain't we?

1035
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:26,535
- Yes, sir!
- Amen!

1036
01:31:31,112 --> 01:31:34,056
- We men, ain't we?
- Yes, sir!

1037
01:31:40,967 --> 01:31:42,600
Shit.

1038
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:44,040
All right.

1039
01:32:40,746 --> 01:32:44,489
- Attention, company!
- Attention, company!

1040
01:32:54,379 --> 01:32:57,706
Battalion, halt!

1041

We ready, CoIonel.

1042
01:33:44,076 --> 01:33:48,844
Left! Left! Left, right!

1043
01:34:02,316 --> 01:34:06,253
- Give 'em hell, 54th!
- Give 'em hell, 54th!

1044
01:34:40,429 --> 01:34:44,813
- Ready! Fire!
- Ready! Fire!

1045
01:34:44,877 --> 01:34:48,174
- Ought to be quite a show, Pierce.
- Best seat in the house.

1046
01:34:49,678 --> 01:34:51,661
l wonder if you might
do something for me.

1047
01:34:55,918 --> 01:34:59,790
l have some letters here.
Personal things.

1048
01:34:59,854 --> 01:35:01,455
Certainly, Colonel.

1049
01:35:01,519 --> 01:35:04,814
Also, if l should fall...

1050
01:35:07,982 --> 01:35:09,903

1051

Take cover in the dunes!

Take cover!

1082
01:41:37,498 --> 01:41:42,746
Company commanders, we'll wait here
and advance under cover of darkness.

1083

Get down over there!

Come on! Come on!
