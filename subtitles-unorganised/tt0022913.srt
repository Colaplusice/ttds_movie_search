1
00:00:31,748 --> 00:00:33,682
We didn't lie to you, folks.

2
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,584
We told you we had living,
breathing monstrosities.

3
00:00:40,423 --> 00:00:43,017
You laughed at them, shuddered at them...

4
00:00:43,493 --> 00:00:46,792
and yet, but for the accident of birth...

5
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:50,192
you might be even as they are.

6
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:54,936
They did not ask
to be brought into the world...

7
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:57,271
but into the world they came.

8
00:00:58,341 --> 00:01:00,866
Their code is a law unto themselves.

9
00:01:02,746 --> 00:01:04,213
Offend one...

10
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:07,547
and you offend them all.

11
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:15,184
And now, folks,
if you'll just step this way...

12
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,388
you are about to witness
the most amazing...

13
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:23,989
the most astounding living monstrosity...

14
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,892
of all time.

15
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:32,738
Friends...

16
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:37,771
she was once a beautiful woman.

17
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:43,481
A royal prince shot himself for love of her.

18
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:47,255
She was known as the peacock of the air.

19
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:02,461
She's the most beautiful big woman
l have ever seen.

20
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:05,239
Why, Hans, how you talk.

21
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,241
l should be jealous pretty soon.

22
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:11,913
-Don't be silly.
-Don't be silly?

23
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,946
l've seen these women
making eyes at my Hans.

24
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:19,280
Of course, l ain't jealous.

25
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,217
Frieda, my dear...

26
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:25,092
l have eyes for only one woman...

27
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:29,795
the woman l asked to be my wife.

28
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:43,277
<i>Frulein</i> Frieda?

29
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:27,520
Are you laughing at me?

30
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,457
-Why, no, <i>monsieur.</i>
-Thanks. l'm glad.

31
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,721
-Why should l laugh at you?
-Most big people do.

32
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:39,430
They don't realize l'm a man
with the same feelings they have.

33
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:47,173
Thank you.

34
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:51,207
You are so kind, <i>monsieur.</i>

35
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,152
-Nice.
-Don't.

36
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,242
You must come to see me sometime,
and we'll have a little wine together.

37
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:27,978
Thank you, <i>Frulein</i> Cleo.

38
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,553
You're getting old, Jean.

39
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:45,465
Probably, last night you had too heavy
a dinner, and now your imagination is--

40
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:49,972
But, <i>Monsieur</i> Duval,
at first l could not believe my own eyes.

41
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:55,000
A lot of horrible, twisted things,
you know, crawling, whining, laughing--

42
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:58,241
Be done, Jean.
What were you drinking last night?

43
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:00,176
Nothing, <i>monsieur,</i> l assure you.

44
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,656
<i>Monsieur,</i> there must be a law in France
to smother such things at birth...

45
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:15,086
-or lock them up.
-All right, Jean.

46
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:19,066
lf there's anything like you say
on my grounds, we'll have it removed.

47
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:43,118
-Come on, let's go.
-All of you! <i>Tout de suite!</i>

48
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:48,225
Go away, all of you!

49
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:51,562
Don't you know trespassing
is the same as stealing?

50
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:56,529
l'm sorry, <i>monsieur.</i>
l am Madame Tetrallini.

51
00:05:57,173 --> 00:06:00,040
These children are in my circus.

52
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:02,636
Children? They're monsters.

53
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:05,540
Your circus. l understand.

54
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:08,874
So you see, <i>monsieur,</i>
when l get a chance...

55
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,848
l like to take them into the sunshine...

56
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:14,921
and let them play like...children.

57
00:06:16,059 --> 00:06:18,926
That is what most of them are.

58
00:06:21,197 --> 00:06:22,459
Children.

59
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:35,102
Please forget what was said, <i>madame.</i>
You are welcome to remain.

60
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:37,675
<i>Au revoir.</i> Come, Jean.

61
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:40,716
Thanks a thousand, <i>monsieur.</i>

62
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:42,944
A thousand thanks, <i>monsieur.</i>

63
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,415
Shame!

64
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,349
How many times have l told you
not to be frightened?

65
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:53,252
Have l not told you...

66
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:57,588
God looks after all his children?

67
00:07:08,277 --> 00:07:11,713
-Good evening, Madame Tetrallini.
-How are you, Madame Tetrallini?

68
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:13,442
Big crowd tonight.

69
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,021
There she goes,
taking them out to exercise.

70
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:24,289
Nurse to a lot of mangy freaks.

71
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:28,059
" Just as they are represented
on the banners...

72
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:30,099
" you will see them on the inside.

73
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,327
" Living, breathing monstrosities.

74
00:07:32,502 --> 00:07:36,199
" Josephine Joseph,
half-woman, half-man."

75
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:38,566
Have a cigar, Joseph.

76
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:40,871
You dropped your lipstick, Josephine.

77
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:43,776
Don't get her sore,
or he'll bust you in the nose.

78
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:50,578
Come on. Hurry up. That's a boy.

79
00:07:56,926 --> 00:08:00,157
You're all wrong. l didn't do it.

80
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:03,021
What are you trying to do, be funny?

81
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:05,124
You just don't understand.

82
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:08,596
A Roman lady....

83
00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:11,537
Getting off the bull
and scratching yourself.

84
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,134
Can't a Roman lady itch?

85
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:19,905
-Why don't you take a bath?
-l did, but it's the bull that needs the bath.

86
00:08:30,393 --> 00:08:33,487
l think she likes you...

87
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:37,628
but he don't.

88
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:52,914
Those flowers you sent to me,
they were beautiful.

89
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:55,882
But not much beautiful as you.

90
00:08:58,588 --> 00:08:59,953
Thank you.

91
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:05,052
And Hans, l don't like to ask...

92
00:09:06,162 --> 00:09:09,359
but may l have the loan
of another 1,000 francs...

93
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,827
until my money from Paris arrives?

94
00:09:12,568 --> 00:09:16,026
-With pleasure, <i>Frulein.</i>
-Thank you.

95
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:19,636
l'll bring it to your wagon tonight.

96
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,212
Forget it.

97
00:09:25,748 --> 00:09:29,047
-Maybe l was just fooling.
-Fooling?

98
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:32,949
" Come, little girl,
l want to take care of you."

99
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,419
And l fell for that.

100
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,495
Forget it.

101
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:55,577
So, you're quitting.

102
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,241
ls that it?

103
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,081
Maybe l'm only fooling.

104
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:03,614
You are not quitting me!

105
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,486
Because l'm kicking you out!

106
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:11,685
No, you don't. l gave you this.

107
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:14,657
Why, you cheap....

108
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:20,495
Don't you come around crying tonight,
trying to get back in.

109
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,839
l'm through wasting my time and money...

110
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:25,771
on things like you.

111
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,307
Yes. Your time, but my money.

112
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:33,506
Ungrateful little tramp.

113
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,490
That is fine.

114
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:47,820
What are you staring at?

115
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:52,300
Didn't you ever see a lady move before?

116
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:56,771
l guess you've been listening
to every word he said.

117
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,534
That's it.

118
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:02,338
Go ahead and laugh. lt's funny, ain't it?

119
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:06,008
Yeah. Women are funny, ain't they?

120
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:09,541
They're all tramps, ain't they?

121
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:12,449
Yeah. Except when you can
get money from them.

122
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,665
l'll be....

123
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,901
Who do you think you are,
shooting off your head?

124
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,940
This is Phroso you're talking to.

125
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:38,036
Not any of those thugs
you've been chasing around with.

126
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,106
-Now, you listen to me.
-l didn't mean you.

127
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:46,011
-l had to take it out on somebody.
-Yeah, you dames are all alike.

128
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:48,156
You're sharpshooting, you're cheap...

129
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:51,193
and how you squeal when you get
what's coming to you.

130
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:55,820
Easy, kid. Cut it!

131
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:00,362
lt's my own fault.

132
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:04,498
What gets me
so cockeyed sore at myself...

133
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:07,201
is that l fell for that big hunk of beef.

134
00:12:07,276 --> 00:12:09,836
So you finally got wise
to yourself, did you?

135
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:13,643
The funny thing about you women is
most of you don't get wise soon enough.

136
00:12:13,716 --> 00:12:16,014
You wait until you're so old,
nobody wants you.

137
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:18,110
Nobody does, most of the time.

138
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,285
You ought to be tickled to death
you're washed-up with him.

139
00:12:21,357 --> 00:12:23,291
You're not so hard to look at.

140
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:25,994
Give yourself a tumble.
You'll make the grade.

141
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:29,790
-Your breaks is coming.
-Coming? Gone, you mean.

142
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:32,459
Now you'll sit there
feeling sorry for yourself.

143
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:35,368
No, l ain't.
Don't you ever accuse me of that.

144
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:37,563
All right.

145
00:12:40,109 --> 00:12:44,102
But one thing, don't go out filling your
hide with booze, celebrating...

146
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,445
'cause fun what's got that way
never done no one no good.

147
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,444
Get me?

148
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,251
l got you.

149
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,789
You're a pretty good kid.

150
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:04,131
You're darn right l am. You should have
caught me before my operation.

151
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,705
-Hello, Phroso.
-Well, well, well.

152
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:16,575
-Tomorrow night's the big night, Daisy?
-Yes, the sister's getting married.

153
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:20,046
-And l'm thrilled to death.
-She thrills at anything.

154
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:24,145
-Roscoe's a good kid.
-She's only joking.

155
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,048
She'll like him lots
after she knows him better.

156
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,355
That reminds me.

157
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:32,987
Close your eyes, Violet.
Go ahead, close them.

158
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,421
-What did l do?
-Pinched Daisy's arm.

159
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,361
What do you know about that?

160
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:45,736
Her master's voice is calling.

161
00:13:46,842 --> 00:13:48,173
Getting fresh?

162
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:50,944
l don't like it one....

163
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:54,748
Come on, you'll have to hurry.
We haven't much time.

164
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:58,445
So you were flirting
with that cheap clown, were you?

165
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:01,551
-No, l wasn't.
-He was doing a trick with me.

166
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,950
You shut up.

167
00:14:03,058 --> 00:14:06,357
l'm marrying your sister, not you.

168
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,395
-l saw him getting familiar with you.
-Come on, Daisy.

169
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:13,924
No, you don't.
She's going to stay right here.

170
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:15,867
No, she isn't. l got to go.

171
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,938
You're always using that for an....

172
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,410
For an alibi.

173
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:35,419
Where are you going?

174
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:43,560
You don't look at others so much, do you?

175
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,891
Yes, l have seen you.

176
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:49,229
So that's how it is.

177
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,770
You got to be caught.

178
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,005
Well?

179
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:11,557
Come on in.

180
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:15,553
Help yourself to a drink.

181
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:17,999
That is fine.

182
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:24,064
Feel like eating something?

183
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,600
Always.

184
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:33,675
Prosit.

185
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:39,714
How many?

186
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:42,924
l'm not very hungry. About six.

187
00:15:48,964 --> 00:15:50,761
How do you like them?

188
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,260
Not bad.

189
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:03,575
But you are strong.
You are squeezing me to death.

190
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,579
And you'll like it.

191
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:08,613
You are taking my breath away.

192
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:22,023
You....

193
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,305
Now, here's something for your eye.

194
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,383
But, Hans, my <i>Liebchen,</i>
you have not been listening...

195
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,645
to a word l have been saying.

196
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:46,348
-Hans.
-Yes, Frieda?

197
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:50,914
-You have not been listening to me.
-Yes, l have, Frieda. l have.

198
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,223
Then what was l saying?

199
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:57,187
You were saying.... What were you saying?

200
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,659
l was saying, tonight
you must not smoke such a big cigar.

201
00:17:02,037 --> 00:17:04,835
Your voice was very bad
at tonight's show.

202
00:17:05,407 --> 00:17:07,807
Please, Frieda, don't tell me what l do.

203
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,174
When l want a cigar, l smoke a cigar.

204
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:14,244
l want no orders from a woman.

205
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:21,721
This is the first time
since we have been engaged...

206
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:24,349
you have spoken to me so.

207
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,759
Why is it?

208
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:32,097
<i>Friedchen,</i> l'm sorry. l....

209
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:35,500
-Here's our coffee.
-There it is.

210
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:40,272
-Five lumps of sugar in each.
-What? Five lumps?

211
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:46,545
The little ape sent to Paris for this?

212
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:50,209
Yes, Paris. We're doing very well.

213
00:17:56,592 --> 00:17:58,492
But l don't like fruit.

214
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,895
You should eat a lot. lt's good for you.

215
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:04,660
Next time, l tell him l like champagne.

216
00:18:08,737 --> 00:18:10,602
-Who is it?
-lt's Hans.

217
00:18:19,748 --> 00:18:21,841
-Who?
-lt's Hans.

218
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:26,213
My darling, your basket of fruit was lovely.

219
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:30,816
But l am...taking a bath now.

220
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:34,418
-Can't you come back later?
-Yes, <i>Frulein.</i>

221
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,325
Thank you, dear.

222
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:45,034
You'll spoil everything if he hears you.

223
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,178
What's the matter?
You ain't singing as usual.

224
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,249
This morning
l have such a big washing to do.

225
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:02,688
How's Hans?

226
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:07,985
l said, how's Hans?

227
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:11,522
Hans is fine. <i>Danke,</i> he's fine.

228
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:16,428
Frieda, something's wrong. What is it?

229
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,536
Nothing. Only....

230
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:25,744
That Cleopatra woman.... My Hans....

231
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:30,451
-l cannot tell it.
-She's still after Hans, ain't she?

232
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,687
Yeah. Always she's smiling by him.

233
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,523
Well, if she smiles by somebody l know...

234
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,026
she'll have to buy herself
a new set of teeth.

235
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:42,558
Why is it we women
always has got to worry?

236
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:46,032
lt's always been that way.
l guess it always will be.

237
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:49,528
Yeah. And, by me, she has no shame.

238
00:19:50,072 --> 00:19:53,530
Always, when l can hear it,
she says to him:

239
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:57,201
" Many thanks, my darling, for the flowers.

240
00:19:57,913 --> 00:20:00,074
" Thanks, my darling," for this...

241
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:02,582
and " Thanks, my darling," for that.

242
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,719
Always something he has given her.

243
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:09,285
Don't you worry, Frieda.
He doesn't love her.

244
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:11,416
That big horse.

245
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:14,424
Yes, but she keeps after him.

246
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:16,592
That's why l worry.

247
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:22,193
Why not pink tights?

248
00:20:22,404 --> 00:20:26,636
You know. With spangles all around.
lt will show her figure off more.

249
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:29,173
<i>Nein.</i> No tights.

250
00:20:30,012 --> 00:20:31,536
Without tights.

251
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:35,014
You know, that soft, flimsy,
what-you-call-it stuff.

252
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:37,408
Where the figure shows through.

253
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,650
Why not like Lady Godiva?

254
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:45,722
<i>Ja,</i> that's it. And l'll hire her
to ride the back of my bull.

255
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:49,161
<i>Dummkopf!</i> What have you
on your shoulder for heads?

256
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:50,826
Swiss cheese?

257
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:59,736
-What's the matter, Cleo?
-l think l strained my shoulder last night.

258
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,005
Give a rub, will you?

259
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:06,111
Farther.

260
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,109
Down.

261
00:21:11,954 --> 00:21:13,182
Over.

262
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:20,888
lt's so good to be rubbed.

263
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,661
-Our cards, lady.
-What for?

264
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,301
A couple of rubbers from Berlin.

265
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:38,939
That reminds me. l had a swell dream
about you last night.

266
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:40,972
-You did?
-Yeah.

267
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:46,182
You were standing in a bathing suit
on a rock. You know, like a statue.

268
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:50,152
The wind was blowing through your hair,
the waves were washing around you.

269
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:54,161
And your figure. How it stood out.
lt looked great.

270
00:21:55,497 --> 00:21:59,024
Say, you have got a good figure.

271
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:02,394
Do you think so?

272
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:05,471
-Sure.
-Phroso.

273
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:09,269
Did you try that gag l told you about?

274
00:22:09,945 --> 00:22:13,779
Yeah, l did, and it was a wow.
Get up here, Johnny. l'll show it to you.

275
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:17,185
l did what you told me,
and it laid them right in the sawdust.

276
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,913
Watch this, Venus.

277
00:22:19,354 --> 00:22:21,447
-Hello, Venus.
-Hello, Johnny.

278
00:22:22,024 --> 00:22:24,458
Phroso, what else did you dream?

279
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,059
Then the dream changed. We was in Paris.

280
00:22:27,195 --> 00:22:29,789
-Paris?
-Yeah, at the opera, right in the front box.

281
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:32,561
-We were all dressed up.
-What did l have on?

282
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:35,829
And did l look swell.
Everybody was pointing at me.

283
00:22:35,904 --> 00:22:38,464
They were saying,
"That's Phroso, the clown."

284
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,700
And was l embarrassed.

285
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:45,137
-Did they say anything about me?
-Sure.

286
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,574
-What did they say?
-Hit me.

287
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,742
Go ahead. Hit me.

288
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,382
On the head. Hit me.

289
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:06,098
That's how it is. You don't think it's funny.

290
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:10,369
lt's sad, is it? lt will just panic them,
that's how sad it is.

291
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:16,935
No.

292
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:21,211
When? Come on!

293
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:27,285
Come on, Venus.
The bearded lady's baby's born!

294
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:47,708
-Ain't it cute? What is it?
-A girl.

295
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:51,912
Oh, boy, that's great.
And it's going to have a beard.

296
00:23:58,587 --> 00:24:00,555
-How's the proud father?
-Fine.

297
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:01,919
-What was it?
-A girl.

298
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,891
Better luck next time.
You may get a couple of Smith Brothers.

299
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,325
l'm trying.

300
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:17,261
Please, Violet, don't quarrel
with him anymore.

301
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:19,967
lf he's going to say anything,
let him say it.

302
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,202
Don't let him " p-p-p" for an hour.

303
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:27,642
You're going to do as l say.
l'm the boss of my home.

304
00:24:27,949 --> 00:24:30,850
-Half of it, you mean.
-Please, Violet.

305
00:24:31,486 --> 00:24:34,614
Listen here. l don't want
those tramps you go with...

306
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:36,350
hanging around my wife.

307
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:39,585
Be quiet. Hook up our dress.

308
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,755
lf it isn't your dress l'm hooking up,
it's something else.

309
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:48,827
And another thing. You got to cut out
getting drunk every night, too.

310
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:50,631
-ls that so?
-Yeah.

311
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:55,805
l'm not going to have my wife laying
in bed half the day with your hangover.

312
00:24:55,877 --> 00:24:57,401
Daisy, let's get out of here.

313
00:24:57,479 --> 00:25:00,971
No, she don't.
She's going to stay right here.

314
00:25:01,483 --> 00:25:03,144
Come on. l got to go.

315
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,957
You're always using that for an....
For an alibi.

316
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,328
Cleopatra ain't one of us.

317
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:22,669
Why, we're just filthy things to her.

318
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:26,806
She'd spit on Hans
if he wasn't giving her presents.

319
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,633
Let her try it.

320
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:33,103
Let her try doing anything to one of us.

321
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:34,776
You're right.

322
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:38,613
She don't know us, but she'll find out.

323
00:25:41,156 --> 00:25:42,646
There you are.

324
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:49,864
l peeked out of the corner of my eye...

325
00:25:49,931 --> 00:25:52,991
and caught Madame Tetrallini
giving us the once-over.

326
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:56,902
l guess she knows she's got a good act.
One of the best in the business.

327
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,065
lt isn't only our act that gets them.

328
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,337
We've got personality.
We know how to sell the stuff.

329
00:26:02,744 --> 00:26:06,578
Same way in the last town.
Never heard such applause in your life.

330
00:26:07,015 --> 00:26:10,280
Let me tell you something
that everybody around here don't know.

331
00:26:10,352 --> 00:26:12,820
We're only killing time with this circus.

332
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:16,679
We've got bigger time to follow,
and we can do it, too.

333
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:20,528
Catch our act tomorrow night.
We got something new.

334
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:23,120
Yeah? Can you do anything
with your eyebrow?

335
00:26:30,572 --> 00:26:34,906
Schlitze, what a pretty dress.
How beautiful you look tonight.

336
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:40,042
You're just a man's woman.

337
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:42,307
You know what l mean? You.

338
00:26:45,253 --> 00:26:48,586
lf you're a good girl,
when l get to Paris l'll buy you a big hat...

339
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:51,251
with a long, beautiful feather on it.

340
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:56,358
-Hello, Elvira.
-Hi.

341
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,492
Hello, Jennie Lee. Look.

342
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,470
Hasn't Schlitze got a beautiful dress?
lsn't that pretty?

343
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:07,907
When l get to Paris, l'm going to buy her
a big hat with a long feather on it.

344
00:27:08,276 --> 00:27:12,713
And if you're good girls, l'll buy you a hat
with a bigger feather on it.

345
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:22,919
Why, Schlitze, what's the matter?

346
00:27:28,296 --> 00:27:30,025
l'm sorry, Schlitze.

347
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,440
Did you see him?
He was out there again tonight.

348
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,573
He followed you from the last town.

349
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:46,614
l know it, and if Eddie sees it,
there'll be a fight.

350
00:27:46,848 --> 00:27:49,976
-lt ain't your fault.
-There you are, Frances.

351
00:27:50,518 --> 00:27:53,078
-Thought you'd gone to bed.
-Hello, Rollo.

352
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,322
Hear that crowd out there again tonight?

353
00:27:56,591 --> 00:28:00,118
l bet you thought the tent was on fire.
Well, it wasn't.

354
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:03,422
Just the Rollo Brothers
panicking them again.

355
00:28:03,998 --> 00:28:06,091
But then, we do it in every town.

356
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:08,727
We're so used to it,
it's getting monotonous.

357
00:28:08,837 --> 00:28:11,465
You want to take a look
at our act tomorrow night.

358
00:28:12,374 --> 00:28:15,275
Careful. Don't waste any of it.

359
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,972
-Look how it sparkles.
-Like your eyes.

360
00:28:21,516 --> 00:28:24,679
Dancing, gay, like bubbles.

361
00:28:29,724 --> 00:28:31,248
lt's delicious.

362
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:35,525
Nice.

363
00:28:36,197 --> 00:28:39,166
lt comes by the finest vineyards of France.

364
00:28:40,402 --> 00:28:42,336
And you sent for it especially for me?

365
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:45,635
For the most beautiful woman
in all the world.

366
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,869
Darling.

367
00:28:53,948 --> 00:28:56,746
Hello there, baby.
Where have you been so long?

368
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,412
You're a funny guy, Phroso.

369
00:29:01,456 --> 00:29:04,152
-Sometimes, you panic me.
-Don't l know it?

370
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:07,795
l panic the world because l use my noodle.

371
00:29:08,062 --> 00:29:11,259
l think up funny gags.
l make the world laugh.

372
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,294
With me, clowning is an art.

373
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:19,137
Why the hat? The head cold?

374
00:29:19,974 --> 00:29:24,434
-Thought you and me had a date to go out.
-l forgot all about it.

375
00:29:25,213 --> 00:29:28,444
Well, l'm into this now.
l've got to go through with it.

376
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:32,043
Make it snappy, will you?
l'm all dolled up for the occasion.

377
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,220
Sorry, kid. Can't do it now.

378
00:29:38,993 --> 00:29:40,927
We'll make it some other time.

379
00:29:42,664 --> 00:29:44,859
Don't feel that way about it.

380
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:48,300
l just got this idea all of a sudden.
l've got to finish it.

381
00:29:49,604 --> 00:29:53,301
-Funny gag, isn't it?
-Yeah, l'm laughing myself sick.

382
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,439
Come on.

383
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,043
Honey, come on.

384
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,311
Now, now.

385
00:30:06,454 --> 00:30:08,183
That's much better.

386
00:30:13,027 --> 00:30:15,552
That's the first time you've ever done that.

387
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,066
-Ain't the first time l felt like doing it.
-Yeah?

388
00:30:26,641 --> 00:30:30,236
l don't mind telling you
l've wanted to do this for a long time.

389
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:41,048
-We're all set now, Venus?
-Yeah.

390
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:43,619
-All set now.
-Yeah.

391
00:30:44,192 --> 00:30:46,057
Please do.

392
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:50,354
Don't you want to make me happy?

393
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,993
-Yes, but l don't know what to say.
-Just say yes, dear.

394
00:30:57,639 --> 00:30:58,901
Will you?

395
00:31:00,475 --> 00:31:02,739
-Yes.
-Violet.

396
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,351
What are your kicking about?
You've got a good wife. You're happy.

397
00:31:15,423 --> 00:31:17,653
lt's that sister-in-law of mine.

398
00:31:17,725 --> 00:31:21,183
She wants to sit up half the night, reading.

399
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:25,996
-That's tough.
-Tough? You....

400
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:34,906
-Good night, darling.
-Good night, <i>Frulein.</i>

401
00:31:41,849 --> 00:31:44,215
Cleo's gone on a diet.

402
00:31:49,857 --> 00:31:53,725
-lt's awfully sweet of you to say that.
-And l know Violet will be happy.

403
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:56,124
Here's Roscoe.

404
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,058
-Hello.
-Roscoe, this is Mr. Rogers.

405
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:02,366
Glad to meet you.

406
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:06,001
-Violet and he are engaged to be married.
-Yeah?

407
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:09,268
Yes, and you must come
to see us sometime.

408
00:32:10,311 --> 00:32:11,335
Thanks.

409
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:13,437
You must come to visit....

410
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:16,540
Come to see us sometime, too.

411
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:18,609
l certainly will. Thanks.

412
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,591
Who is it?

413
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:34,995
lt's Frieda, Hans.

414
00:32:40,608 --> 00:32:42,235
May l come in?

415
00:32:43,511 --> 00:32:44,910
Yes, Frieda.

416
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,624
Now that l'm here,
l don't know how to say it...

417
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,259
how to make you understand.

418
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:12,165
lf you knew how l feel, Hans...

419
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,973
to come to you about her.

420
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:18,812
Frieda, l'm so sorry.

421
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:23,048
l don't want to hurt you,
but <i>ich kann es nicht helfen.</i>

422
00:33:23,985 --> 00:33:26,283
lf you could be happy, Hans...

423
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,847
l would not care.

424
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:33,554
But l am happy, Frieda.
Never in my life was l so happy.

425
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:37,764
No, Hans. You think it only.

426
00:33:38,499 --> 00:33:40,729
For you, she cannot bring happiness.

427
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,603
Frieda, you don't know.

428
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:49,867
But l do, Hans.

429
00:33:51,145 --> 00:33:53,739
You think because she's so beautiful
and l'm just--

430
00:33:53,815 --> 00:33:55,874
Don't, Hans. Please.

431
00:33:57,151 --> 00:33:58,914
To me, you're a man.

432
00:33:59,387 --> 00:34:02,584
But to her,
you're only something to laugh at.

433
00:34:03,257 --> 00:34:06,852
The whole circus.
They make fun by you and her.

434
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:10,525
Let them laugh. The swine.

435
00:34:10,932 --> 00:34:13,628
l love her. They can't hurt me.

436
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,398
But they hurt me.

437
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,801
Frieda, l have been a coward.

438
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,167
l should have come to you
in the beginning.

439
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:26,646
Please forgive me.

440
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:30,016
Yes, Hans, l forgive you.

441
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:34,049
lt is only that you should be happy l want.

442
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,219
You won't worry now, will you?

443
00:34:42,764 --> 00:34:44,959
No, l won't worry.

444
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,872
Nice. Very nice.

445
00:34:59,046 --> 00:35:00,377
lt's platinum.

446
00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:04,645
Say, where do you think
that little polliwog is getting his money?

447
00:35:06,754 --> 00:35:10,315
Listen at him. Getting so particular.

448
00:35:10,558 --> 00:35:13,083
What do you care
where the money comes from?

449
00:35:14,295 --> 00:35:15,956
How much it's worth?

450
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:20,795
We got $500 for the bracelet,
but this looks like thousands.

451
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,463
l think next time l'll take a fur coat.

452
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:31,478
Say, that little ape's got ideas about you.

453
00:35:31,846 --> 00:35:33,711
-Jealous?
-Me?

454
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,540
l'd squish him like a bug.

455
00:35:39,187 --> 00:35:42,645
That's his knock.
l'll get rid of him. Go quickly.

456
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:49,656
Come in.

457
00:35:56,437 --> 00:35:57,836
What do you want?

458
00:36:02,777 --> 00:36:04,210
lt's about Hans.

459
00:36:07,448 --> 00:36:09,541
Well? l'm listening.

460
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:12,982
lt's behind his back.

461
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:17,517
Everybody's laughing
because he's in love with you.

462
00:36:18,492 --> 00:36:19,652
Go on.

463
00:36:21,495 --> 00:36:23,588
l know you just make fun...

464
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,060
but Hans, he does not know this.

465
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:30,163
lf he finds out...

466
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:33,171
never again will he be happy.

467
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:36,442
What makes you think
that l am just making fun?

468
00:36:37,011 --> 00:36:39,104
You're big. So beautiful--

469
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,944
And Hans is so little...

470
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,245
so cute.

471
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:48,118
Well, maybe l'm going to marry him.

472
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:53,359
lf you marry,
it will be at you they laugh and stare.

473
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:57,122
That's good. Nothing like being different.

474
00:36:57,398 --> 00:36:58,626
Cleopatra...

475
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:02,465
queen of the air, married to a dwarp.

476
00:37:03,437 --> 00:37:06,338
-A dwarf.
-A dwarp!

477
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:09,740
Then it's not for Hans you care.

478
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:12,671
-lt's the money.
-Money?

479
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:16,449
You little mind reader.

480
00:37:18,185 --> 00:37:22,281
He has told you
of the fortune he has inherited.

481
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,683
Always he swear to me...

482
00:37:25,893 --> 00:37:29,761
to tell no one
until after we leave the circus.

483
00:37:31,132 --> 00:37:32,531
A fortune?

484
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:38,469
And fancy you knowing about it, too.

485
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:42,275
Well, l can't be angry at him for that.

486
00:37:45,146 --> 00:37:48,274
No. You cannot do this.

487
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,347
You wait and see.

488
00:37:57,024 --> 00:38:00,221
Please. You can't.

489
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:12,203
A fortune.
l bet the little ape's worth billions!

490
00:38:13,841 --> 00:38:16,867
A fortune. Can you beat that?

491
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:20,507
A fortune. And l have him like that.

492
00:38:21,315 --> 00:38:24,648
Shrewd little Hans.
He knew enough to keep his mouth shut.

493
00:38:24,986 --> 00:38:26,419
l could marry him.

494
00:38:27,188 --> 00:38:30,021
Yes, he would marry me.

495
00:38:37,765 --> 00:38:41,201
Midgets are not strong.

496
00:38:43,304 --> 00:38:44,965
He could get sick.

497
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,632
How?

498
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,668
lt could be done.

499
00:38:52,646 --> 00:38:55,274
Done. l know it.

500
00:39:30,084 --> 00:39:32,917
Come on, my little precious.
Come on, let's drink.

501
00:39:33,487 --> 00:39:35,648
Big, happy drink. Come on.

502
00:39:38,993 --> 00:39:40,722
Quiet! Please be quiet.

503
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,424
Hey, Koo Koo,
give somebody else a chance.

504
00:39:47,168 --> 00:39:48,499
All right!

505
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,863
All right, professor.

506
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:53,831
A waltz, please.

507
00:40:07,788 --> 00:40:10,222
Show him up, volcano. Burn him up.

508
00:40:21,235 --> 00:40:24,033
Our wedding night.

509
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:29,702
What a thrill.

510
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,374
Never before did l think
l should be so lucky.

511
00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:34,607
Lucky?

512
00:40:39,453 --> 00:40:41,512
l am the lucky one.

513
00:40:42,123 --> 00:40:43,988
My little Hans.

514
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,390
My Cleo's happy.

515
00:40:47,294 --> 00:40:49,125
-Happy.
-Happy?

516
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:55,701
l am so happy.

517
00:40:56,036 --> 00:41:00,439
l even could kiss you,
you big, homely brute.

518
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:21,728
My little green-eyed monster.

519
00:41:24,265 --> 00:41:26,995
My husband is jealous.

520
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,398
He loves me.

521
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:43,074
Come, my little lover.

522
00:41:43,384 --> 00:41:47,787
Drink to the happiness of your loving wife.

523
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:56,558
Attention!

524
00:41:57,164 --> 00:41:59,064
We'll make her one of us.

525
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:01,293
A loving cup.

526
00:42:01,368 --> 00:42:03,563
<i>We accept her, one of us</i>

527
00:42:07,975 --> 00:42:10,000
<i>We accept her</i>

528
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,945
<i>One of us</i>

529
00:42:17,885 --> 00:42:22,083
They're going to make you one of them.
My, big luck.

530
00:42:31,498 --> 00:42:33,432
<i>We accept her!</i>

531
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:37,700
<i>One of us!</i>

532
00:43:20,047 --> 00:43:24,245
They're going to make you one of them,
my dear.

533
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:32,124
You dirty...

534
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:35,119
slimy freaks!

535
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:39,023
Get out of here!

536
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,028
You! Out!

537
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:45,428
Get out! You heard her! Get out!

538
00:43:51,278 --> 00:43:52,905
You filth!

539
00:43:54,014 --> 00:43:56,676
Make me one of you, will you?

540
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,944
Well, what are you going to do?

541
00:44:00,654 --> 00:44:03,282
What are you, a man or a baby?

542
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:07,425
Please. You make me ashamed.

543
00:44:07,695 --> 00:44:09,686
Ashamed. You?

544
00:44:10,931 --> 00:44:13,695
Holy jumping Christmas!

545
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:19,464
What must l do?
Must l play games with you?

546
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:22,634
Must mama take you horsy-back ride?

547
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:25,911
That's it. Horsy-back ride.

548
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:31,346
Come, my little flyspeck.

549
00:44:31,819 --> 00:44:35,346
Mama is going to take you
horsy-back ride.

550
00:44:36,857 --> 00:44:39,052
-Come on.
-Giddyap.

551
00:44:53,006 --> 00:44:54,598
Forget it, Hans.

552
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:57,640
She is sorry. l'm sorry.

553
00:44:58,479 --> 00:45:00,504
Didn't l told you she was drunk?

554
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,948
Didn't l told you
we was only having a little fun?

555
00:45:05,352 --> 00:45:06,546
Please.

556
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:10,356
l understand.

557
00:45:11,692 --> 00:45:13,683
-Everything.
-No, you don't.

558
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:17,491
l tell you,
there's nothing between me and Cleo.

559
00:45:17,564 --> 00:45:18,826
Be quiet.

560
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:22,396
Haven't you done
enough damage for one night?

561
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:25,700
Don't you realize
what l'm being accused of?

562
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:29,304
l ain't going to be blamed
for something l have not done.

563
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,942
l don't blame you, Cleo.

564
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,113
l don't blame Hercules.

565
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:40,210
Only me.

566
00:45:41,121 --> 00:45:42,281
Myself.

567
00:45:42,856 --> 00:45:44,585
Now you're talking.

568
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:47,927
-Talking like a man.
-You fool.

569
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:53,900
Always l should have known...

570
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:56,831
you would only laugh at me.

571
00:45:57,738 --> 00:46:02,072
My sweet, l'd rather fall from the trapeze
and break my neck...

572
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:04,539
than hurt your feelings.

573
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:09,242
Do you understand now? lt was only joke.

574
00:46:14,221 --> 00:46:15,711
Our wedding...

575
00:46:16,957 --> 00:46:18,151
a joke?

576
00:46:21,295 --> 00:46:23,855
Now l know how funny it is.

577
00:46:25,232 --> 00:46:27,632
Hans the midget.

578
00:46:31,271 --> 00:46:34,638
Hans...the fool!

579
00:46:35,476 --> 00:46:38,240
Tell the divorce court. They'll laugh.

580
00:46:39,246 --> 00:46:42,113
Everywhere, they're laughing.

581
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:54,421
-You give him too much.
-No, l haven't.

582
00:46:55,128 --> 00:46:57,028
l know what l am doing.

583
00:46:57,764 --> 00:46:59,561
Come on, pick him up.

584
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:35,267
Doctor, what is it?

585
00:47:36,003 --> 00:47:37,493
What caused it?

586
00:47:40,007 --> 00:47:41,201
Poison.

587
00:47:51,218 --> 00:47:53,846
A very bad case of ptomaine poisoning.

588
00:47:57,391 --> 00:47:59,916
Doctor, did l do wrong, then?

589
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:02,461
Giving him mustard water?

590
00:48:03,597 --> 00:48:06,259
No. Probably saved his life.

591
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:20,409
Never before did he drink like that...

592
00:48:21,548 --> 00:48:24,745
but she kept making him,
and making him.

593
00:48:25,852 --> 00:48:27,012
Drink?

594
00:48:54,781 --> 00:48:59,150
You better get Cleo to tell the doctor
what she put in that wine last night.

595
00:48:59,486 --> 00:49:02,944
-What you're talking about?
-The stuff she put in the wine.

596
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,490
You're crazy.

597
00:49:04,725 --> 00:49:07,421
You can't get away with it.
l'll tell the coppers.

598
00:49:07,494 --> 00:49:10,224
So, tell on your own people?

599
00:49:10,497 --> 00:49:12,624
My people are decent circus folks.

600
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:16,032
Not dirty rats what would kill a freak
to get his money.

601
00:49:16,103 --> 00:49:17,866
You dirty little....

602
00:49:24,144 --> 00:49:26,738
Your imagination's getting the best of you.

603
00:49:26,813 --> 00:49:28,280
Yeah, maybe it is.

604
00:49:28,348 --> 00:49:31,579
But coppers don't have imaginations,
so l've been told.

605
00:49:34,154 --> 00:49:36,554
Don't make me have to go to them.

606
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,834
-Cleo.
-Yes?

607
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:34,345
lt has been a week tonight...

608
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,542
since we have been married.

609
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:41,754
A week, since l have said...

610
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,050
-all those things to you.
-Don't!

611
00:50:47,561 --> 00:50:51,657
Never can l forgive myself
for what l've said.

612
00:50:52,099 --> 00:50:53,760
l've forgotten it.

613
00:50:54,034 --> 00:50:57,993
Nothing matters except for you to be well.

614
00:51:00,741 --> 00:51:03,869
So good you are by me, Cleo.

615
00:51:05,612 --> 00:51:08,445
l must fix your medicine, or l'll be late.

616
00:52:19,586 --> 00:52:21,781
l'll be soon back, my little.

617
00:52:22,322 --> 00:52:23,949
Don't be lonely.

618
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:29,188
l'll never forget
what you are doing for me, Cleo.

619
00:52:29,996 --> 00:52:32,464
But it's what l want to do, my darling.

620
00:52:35,468 --> 00:52:36,992
Now l must hurry.

621
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,471
-Cleo.
-Yes?

622
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:42,130
Will you leave the door open, please?

623
00:52:42,809 --> 00:52:44,538
Yes, my darling.

624
00:53:34,895 --> 00:53:37,386
-Tonight.
-They will be ready.

625
00:53:37,931 --> 00:53:40,263
All right. You come to my wagon.

626
00:53:49,743 --> 00:53:54,578
" l must hurry now
and fix your medicine, my darling...

627
00:53:54,781 --> 00:53:56,544
" or l will be late."

628
00:54:00,053 --> 00:54:01,281
" Dirty...

629
00:54:01,855 --> 00:54:03,789
" slimy freaks."

630
00:54:30,383 --> 00:54:32,476
-He's waiting.
-Fine.

631
00:54:48,835 --> 00:54:50,325
Soon we go.

632
00:55:22,035 --> 00:55:24,595
-You're imagining things.
-No.

633
00:55:24,704 --> 00:55:28,800
Then l hear Hercules tell Cleo:
"Venus knows too much."

634
00:55:29,342 --> 00:55:32,004
-Hercules? Venus?
-Yes.

635
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,940
Thanks, Frieda.

636
00:55:48,561 --> 00:55:50,893
My little, you must go to sleep.

637
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,524
Your friends better go now.

638
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,735
-l like them here.
-No, Hans.

639
00:55:57,303 --> 00:55:59,203
They can come back tomorrow.

640
00:55:59,706 --> 00:56:03,073
l will give you your medicine
and get you off to sleep.

641
00:56:04,077 --> 00:56:06,637
Go on, all of you. Quick.

642
00:56:17,357 --> 00:56:20,656
-What's this?
-Give me that little black bottle.

643
00:56:48,688 --> 00:56:49,882
Bottle.

644
00:56:57,097 --> 00:57:01,124
You got this bottle of poison...to kill.

645
00:57:27,894 --> 00:57:29,088
Phroso!

646
00:57:37,303 --> 00:57:38,827
Get out, Venus!

647
00:57:38,905 --> 00:57:41,533
Do l have to bust you in the jaw
to make you get out?

648
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,884
Get out, Venus!

649
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:58,418
Help me!

650
00:58:09,002 --> 00:58:11,436
Mrs. T!

651
00:59:35,121 --> 00:59:37,749
Help! Please, help!

652
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:50,931
How she got that way
will never be known.

653
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:54,829
Some say a jealous lover. Others...

654
00:59:56,442 --> 00:59:58,933
that it was the code of the freaks.

655
01:00:00,313 --> 01:00:01,974
Others, the storm.

656
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:06,008
Believe it or not, there she is.

657
01:00:19,332 --> 01:00:21,698
But, sir, they insist on seeing you.

658
01:00:22,068 --> 01:00:24,798
ln all these years, l've seen no one.

659
01:00:25,271 --> 01:00:27,262
Have l not told you that?

660
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:30,408
-Send them away.
-Very good, sir.

661
01:00:31,678 --> 01:00:35,239
-l can't see no one.
-Excuse me, sir. You can't come in.

662
01:00:35,315 --> 01:00:39,183
-No, sir. l have my orders.
-Who's going to stop me? l'm in, ain't l?

663
01:00:39,686 --> 01:00:41,916
Yes, you can, Hansie, old boy.

664
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,621
There's someone you've just got to see.

665
01:00:44,991 --> 01:00:47,186
Why did you come here?

666
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:51,685
Please, Hans. Don't be angry.

667
01:00:52,632 --> 01:00:56,398
Venus and Phroso have been
so kind by me.

668
01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:59,597
Please go away.

669
01:01:00,373 --> 01:01:02,568
l can see no one.

670
01:01:05,511 --> 01:01:09,038
But, Hans, you tried to stop them.

671
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,779
lt was only the poison you wanted.

672
01:01:14,153 --> 01:01:16,018
lt wasn't your fault.

673
01:01:18,624 --> 01:01:21,092
Don't cry, Hans.

674
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:24,354
Come to me, my <i>Liebchen.</i>

675
01:01:25,665 --> 01:01:26,893
Don't cry.

676
01:01:28,701 --> 01:01:30,100
Don't, Hans.

677
01:01:30,636 --> 01:01:31,967
Don't cry.

678
01:01:33,172 --> 01:01:34,537
l love you.

679
