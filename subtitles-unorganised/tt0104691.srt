1
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,615
Hello!

2
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,865
John Cameron!

3
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:46,145
Chingachgook! How are you?

4
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:52,871
The Master of Life is good, John.
Another year passed.

5
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:54,920
How is it with you?

6
00:04:54,985 --> 00:04:57,023
Getting along. Yes, I am.

7
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,316
Nathaniel.

8
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,148
Hello, John. Cleared another quarter, I see.

9
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:06,302
Yes, I did.

10
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:10,398
-Alexandra.
-Welcome.

11
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:11,680
Jack. How are you?

12
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,158
Hello, Nathaniel.

13
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:15,265
-How've you been?
-Good, thank you.

14
00:05:15,368 --> 00:05:17,124
Where have you boys been trapping?

15
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:18,817
West of the Continental.

16
00:05:19,847 --> 00:05:21,375
Why is Uncas with you?

17
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:25,596
He should have settled with a woman,
started a family by now.

18
00:05:27,624 --> 00:05:29,118
Uncas, look.

19
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,020
Mohawk field we saw
was five-mile long on the river.

20
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,879
Chief Joseph Brandt's field.

21
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:36,479
-You take much fur?
-That we did.

22
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:38,307
-Lots.
-The Horican is near trapped out.

23
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:39,836
Where're you trading? Castleton?

24
00:05:39,912 --> 00:05:42,662
-Schuylerville.
-Schuylerville, with the Dutch for silver.

25
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,760
French and English want to pay
with wampum and brandy.

26
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,261
What is it, Jack? What brings you here?

27
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:54,750
A French and Indian army's heading south
out of Fort Carillon to war...

28
00:05:54,824 --> 00:05:59,461
...against the British. I'm helping raise
New York's militia to fill the Crown's levy.

29
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:05,216
And the people here
are going to join in that fight?

30
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,693
We'll see in the morning.

31
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,221
Where are you boys heading?

32
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:09,788
We'll trap over the fall...

33
00:06:09,863 --> 00:06:13,858
...and winter in Can-tuck-ee. Find
a Delaware-speaking woman for Uncas.

34
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:17,155
She will say, "You are the one! "
Bear him many children!

35
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,294
Then you can have a boy like me.

36
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,472
Never. You're too strong.

37
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:23,748
Turn me old too fast.

38
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:25,952
That's what he's doing to his mama.

39
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,509
John Cameron,
thank you for your hospitality.

40
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:48,677
Mohawk got no quarrel with Les Franais.

41
00:06:48,872 --> 00:06:50,783
Traded furs with Les Franais.

42
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,699
Now, Les Franais bring Huron, Ottawa...

43
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:57,440
...Abenaki onto Mohawk land.
Now, Mohawk will fight...

44
00:06:57,512 --> 00:06:59,268
...Les Franais and Huron.

45
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,814
I speak for the Twin River Mohawk
of the Six Nations.

46
00:07:02,984 --> 00:07:06,725
His Majesty King George ll
is very grateful for your support.

47
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,198
How far up the valley?

48
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:11,462
-Up to Fort William Henry.
-That's two nights and a bit from here.

49
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:14,080
Should be enough to remind you
France is our enemy.

50
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:15,680
France is your enemy.

51
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:17,183
What did you say?

52
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:20,255
While we're at your fort,
what if the French attack our homes?

53
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,637
What then, Lieutenant?

54
00:07:21,704 --> 00:07:23,940
For your homes, for King, for country!

55
00:07:24,648 --> 00:07:26,950
That's why you men
ought to join this fight!

56
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:29,054
You do what you want
with your own scalp.

57
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,549
Don't be telling us
what we ought to do with ours.

58
00:07:31,624 --> 00:07:35,039
You call yourself a patriot?
A loyal subject to the Crown?

59
00:07:35,526 --> 00:07:38,080
I do not call myself subject to much at all.

60
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:43,941
I agree with some of what Nathaniel
and John say.

61
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:47,297
But I believe England's still our sovereign.

62
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,643
I'll fight with you, Jack.

63
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:54,913
I'm staying on my farm.

64
00:07:55,112 --> 00:07:57,152
Any man who goes, his family's welcome...

65
00:07:57,224 --> 00:07:59,264
...to fort up with us till he comes back.

66
00:07:59,527 --> 00:08:02,177
Boys, my sense of it is
we have enough here to fill...

67
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,312
...the county levy.
It's a fight we ought to make.

68
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,900
But first, we've got to get terms
from General Webb.

69
00:08:10,152 --> 00:08:11,908
Where are you meeting him?

70
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,789
We'll go to Albany.

71
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,681
You, help my man outside
with the baggage.

72
00:09:36,073 --> 00:09:39,301
If they're not allowed leave
to defend their families and homes...

73
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:41,376
...if the French attack the settlements...

74
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,837
...no colonial militia will go
to Fort William Henry.

75
00:09:43,913 --> 00:09:46,149
They will report or be pressed into service.

76
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:48,998
I cannot imagine His Majesty,
in all his benevolence...

77
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:52,032
...would ever object
to his loyal American subjects...

78
00:09:52,103 --> 00:09:55,037
...defending their hearth and home,
their women and children.

79
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:57,283
Does that mean they'll be granted leave...

80
00:09:57,352 --> 00:10:00,352
...to defend their homes
if the settlements are attacked?

81
00:10:00,424 --> 00:10:01,765
Of course.

82
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,745
You got yourself a colonial militia, General.

83
00:10:13,352 --> 00:10:15,522
Major Duncan Heyward reporting, sir.

84
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:18,564
En route to Fort William Henry
and bearing dispatches.

85
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:20,159
Safe journey, I trust?

86
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:23,941
Yes, and I didn't experience anything
so surprising from Bristol to Albany...

87
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:26,014
...as that which I witnessed here today.

88
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,462
What was that?

89
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:30,408
The Crown "negotiating"
the terms of service.

90
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,877
I know, one has to reason with these
colonials to get them to do anything.

91
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:38,151
Tiring, isn't it?
But that's the lay of the land.

92
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:42,405
I thought British policy is,
"Make the world England," sir.

93
00:10:52,327 --> 00:10:55,426
I see you're to serve
with the 35th Regiment of Foot...

94
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:58,462
...at Fort William Henry,
under Colonel Munro.

95
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:03,271
I'll be marching the 60th to Fort Edward.

96
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:10,408
Explain to the Major he has little to fear...

97
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:14,083
...from this General Marquis de Montcalm
in the first place...

98
00:11:14,568 --> 00:11:17,983
...and therefore scant need
of a colonial militia in the second...

99
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:21,219
...because the French
haven't the nature for war.

100
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:25,501
They'd rather eat and make love
with their faces than fight.

101
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,722
Might I inquire if General Webb
has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters?

102
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:34,468
I was to rendezvous with them in Albany,
and escort them to the fort, sir.

103
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:36,805
You there. What does Munro call you?

104
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:41,762
The Scotsman has sent you
one of his Mohawk allies to guide you.

105
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:43,141
Magua.

106
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:47,710
The Scotsman's daughters
are at the Poltroon's house.

107
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:51,271
A company of the 60th
will accompany you...

108
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:53,983
...and Magua will show you the way.

109
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:57,280
Dawn. At the encampment.
6:00 a.m. sharp.

110
00:11:57,353 --> 00:11:58,979
See to it you're there.

111
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,644
I'll take it for you, sir.

112
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:18,661
Cora.

113
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:21,215
Duncan.

114
00:12:22,664 --> 00:12:26,439
-How long have you been in Albany?
-For days and days. And yourself?.

115
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,037
Just arrived.

116
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,985
By God, it's good to see you.

117
00:12:40,232 --> 00:12:42,305
I don't know what to say, Duncan.

118
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,566
I truly wish they did, but my feelings...

119
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,717
...don't go beyond friendship.

120
00:12:57,865 --> 00:12:59,044
Don't you see?

121
00:13:01,801 --> 00:13:05,664
Respect and friendship.
Isn't that a reasonable basis...

122
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:09,150
...for a man and a woman to be married?
All else may grow in time.

123
00:13:09,928 --> 00:13:11,619
Some say that's the way of it.

124
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,669
Some?

125
00:13:12,744 --> 00:13:14,468
Cousin Eugenie, my father--

126
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:15,997
Well, then, Cora...

127
00:13:16,073 --> 00:13:17,502
...in my heart, I know.

128
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:21,024
Once we're joined we'll be
the most marvelous couple in London.

129
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,229
I'm certain of that.

130
00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:26,982
So, why not let those whom you trust,
your father...

131
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:29,186
...help settle what's best for you?

132
00:13:29,672 --> 00:13:32,868
In view of your indecision,
you should rely on their judgment.

133
00:13:32,968 --> 00:13:34,082
And mine.

134
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:38,243
Will you consider that?

135
00:13:44,392 --> 00:13:45,918
Please consider that.

136
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:50,753
Yes.

137
00:13:52,745 --> 00:13:53,857
Yes, I will.

138
00:13:54,472 --> 00:13:55,685
Duncan!

139
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:59,102
By God, you've grown up.

140
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:01,149
We leave in the morning?

141
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:03,593
-Yes, miss.
-I shan't sleep tonight.

142
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:06,177
What an adventure.
Have you seen the red men?

143
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,703
A few.

144
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:11,624
I absolutely cannot wait to return
to Portman Square...

145
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:14,272
...having been to the wilderness.
It's so exciting.

146
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,681
Alice?

147
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:02,398
-Can we rest soon?
-Absolutely.

148
00:15:05,128 --> 00:15:06,405
You there.

149
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,751
Scout. We must stop soon.
Women are tired.

150
00:15:11,848 --> 00:15:12,863
Not here.

151
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:15,686
Two leagues. Better water.
We stop there.

152
00:15:15,753 --> 00:15:17,759
No, stop in the glade just ahead.

153
00:15:17,832 --> 00:15:20,615
When the ladies are rested
we will proceed. Do you understand?

154
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:30,471
Excuse me, what did you say?

155
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:35,264
Magua said,
"I understand English very well."

156
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,114
Hold tight.

157
00:17:27,626 --> 00:17:29,185
Right! Step to the right!

158
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:31,198
All fire right! Ranks!

159
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,643
Make ready!

160
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:42,920
Ready!

161
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:46,336
Aim!

162
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,593
Fire!

163
00:19:44,106 --> 00:19:45,479
No, Duncan.

164
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:49,799
In case your aim's any better
than your judgment.

165
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:07,710
Your wounded should try walking
on back to Albany.

166
00:20:07,785 --> 00:20:09,923
They'll never make a passage north.

167
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:12,419
Stop it! Stop it!

168
00:20:12,522 --> 00:20:15,139
-We need them to get out!
-Why's he losing the horses?

169
00:20:15,242 --> 00:20:16,649
Why don't you ask him?

170
00:20:16,712 --> 00:20:18,121
Too easy to track.

171
00:20:18,282 --> 00:20:21,315
They'll be heard for miles.
Find yourself a musket.

172
00:20:22,185 --> 00:20:24,421
We were headed to Fort William Henry.

173
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:38,818
We'll take you as far as the fort.

174
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,880
We're walking out of here fast.

175
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:54,398
Less all of you'd rather wait
for the next Huron war party to come by.

176
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,581
Scout, I'd like to thank you for your help.

177
00:22:08,682 --> 00:22:10,088
How much further is it?

178
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:11,462
A night and a bit.

179
00:22:11,785 --> 00:22:13,696
Appears we're well away from them.

180
00:22:13,802 --> 00:22:14,914
Maybe.

181
00:22:15,082 --> 00:22:16,709
Maybe they aren't alone.

182
00:22:17,065 --> 00:22:18,888
That Huron captain back there--

183
00:22:18,954 --> 00:22:20,514
The guide? He's a Mohawk.

184
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:24,360
No Mohawk, he's Huron. What reason
did he have to murder the girl?

185
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:26,402
What?

186
00:22:26,473 --> 00:22:27,781
The dark-haired one.

187
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,224
Miss Cora Munro? Murder her?
He never set eyes on her before today.

188
00:22:32,648 --> 00:22:34,176
She's only been here a week.

189
00:22:34,281 --> 00:22:36,323
No blood vengeance?
No reproach or insult?

190
00:22:36,395 --> 00:22:39,940
Of course not!
How is it you were so nearby?

191
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:42,271
Came across the war party.

192
00:22:42,346 --> 00:22:43,360
Tracked them.

193
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:45,540
Then you're assigned
to Fort William Henry?

194
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:46,470
No.

195
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,422
Fort Edward, then?

196
00:22:49,449 --> 00:22:51,271
Heading west for Can-tuck-ee.

197
00:22:51,945 --> 00:22:54,759
There is a war on.
How is it you are heading west?

198
00:22:57,483 --> 00:23:01,475
We kind of face to the north
and real sudden like turn left.

199
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,951
I thought all our colonial scouts
were in the militia.

200
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,391
The militia is fighting the French
in the north.

201
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,700
I'm not your scout.

202
00:23:09,802 --> 00:23:11,874
And I sure ain't in no damn militia.

203
00:23:13,803 --> 00:23:14,979
Clear it up any?

204
00:25:19,689 --> 00:25:21,347
Ottawa, two Franais.

205
00:25:21,545 --> 00:25:22,920
What did you say?

206
00:25:24,811 --> 00:25:27,265
Mirrors, tools.

207
00:25:29,354 --> 00:25:30,337
Clothes.

208
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:34,405
Everything was inside.
They didn't take anything.

209
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,506
They were moving fast. A war party.

210
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,500
Let us look after them.

211
00:25:43,562 --> 00:25:44,674
Leave them.

212
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:48,420
Whoever they are,
though they're strangers...

213
00:25:48,521 --> 00:25:50,977
...they're at least entitled
to a Christian burial.

214
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,511
They can't be left behind.

215
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:53,634
Let us go, miss.

216
00:25:53,707 --> 00:25:56,641
I will not!
I've seen the face of war before, sir...

217
00:25:56,714 --> 00:25:59,300
...but I've not seen war
made upon women and children.

218
00:25:59,403 --> 00:26:01,705
And almost as cruel is your indifference.

219
00:26:13,481 --> 00:26:17,311
Miss Munro. They're not strangers.

220
00:26:20,427 --> 00:26:22,149
And they stay as they lay.

221
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:18,115
Why didn't you bury those people?

222
00:27:18,634 --> 00:27:21,219
Anyone looking for our trail
would see it as a sign...

223
00:27:21,322 --> 00:27:22,882
...we'd passed that way.

224
00:27:26,666 --> 00:27:28,096
You knew them well?

225
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:39,559
You were acting for our benefit
and I apologize.

226
00:27:40,811 --> 00:27:42,270
I misunderstood you.

227
00:27:43,209 --> 00:27:45,031
Well, that's to be expected.

228
00:27:46,153 --> 00:27:48,675
-My father warned me about--
-Your father?

229
00:27:49,386 --> 00:27:52,102
Chingachgook.
He warned me about people like you.

230
00:27:52,234 --> 00:27:53,609
Oh, he did?

231
00:27:54,283 --> 00:27:56,999
-He said, "Do not try to understand them."
-What?

232
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,760
Yes, and, "Do not try to make them
understand you.

233
00:28:02,604 --> 00:28:05,832
"That is because they are a breed apart
and make no sense."

234
00:29:07,531 --> 00:29:08,991
Why did they turn back?

235
00:29:09,065 --> 00:29:10,561
Burial ground.

236
00:29:18,987 --> 00:29:21,060
A breed apart, we make no sense?

237
00:29:22,315 --> 00:29:25,129
In your particular case, miss,
I'd make allowance.

238
00:29:25,194 --> 00:29:26,624
Thank you so much.

239
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:35,076
Where's your real family?

240
00:29:37,387 --> 00:29:39,775
They buried my ma and pa and my sisters.

241
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:44,032
Chingachgook found me with two French
trappers, raised me up as his own.

242
00:29:45,227 --> 00:29:46,306
I'm sorry.

243
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:49,767
I do not remember them.
I wasn't but one or two.

244
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:52,646
How did you learn English?

245
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,600
My father sent Uncas and I to Reverend
Wheelock's school when I was 10.

246
00:30:02,922 --> 00:30:06,403
Why were those people living
in this defenseless place?

247
00:30:10,474 --> 00:30:13,704
After seven years indentured service
in Virginia, they headed here...

248
00:30:13,803 --> 00:30:17,282
...because the frontier's the only land
available to poor people.

249
00:30:17,674 --> 00:30:22,146
Out here, they're beholden to none.
Not living by another's leave.

250
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:29,445
Their name was Cameron.

251
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,842
John and Alexandra Cameron.

252
00:30:57,931 --> 00:31:00,899
My father's people say
that at the birth of the sun...

253
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:04,202
...and of his brother, the moon,
their mother died.

254
00:31:05,481 --> 00:31:09,376
So the sun gave to the earth her body,
from which was to spring all life.

255
00:31:10,667 --> 00:31:13,317
And he drew forth
from her breast the stars.

256
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:17,955
The stars he threw into the night sky
to remind him of her soul.

257
00:31:24,556 --> 00:31:26,759
So there's the Camerons' monument.

258
00:31:30,187 --> 00:31:31,713
My folks', too, I guess.

259
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,638
You are right, Mr. Poe.

260
00:31:47,211 --> 00:31:49,699
We do not understand
what is happening here.

261
00:31:50,027 --> 00:31:53,955
And it's not as I imagined it to be,
thinking of it in Boston and London.

262
00:31:54,123 --> 00:31:55,552
Sorry to disappoint you.

263
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:59,783
No, on the contrary.
It is more deeply stirring to my blood...

264
00:32:02,986 --> 00:32:05,637
...than any imagining
could possibly have been.

265
00:32:45,035 --> 00:32:47,784
Top of the next ridge.
The fort's downhill of it.

266
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:53,984
The men of the regiment will fetch water
from the lake, build fires...

267
00:32:54,282 --> 00:32:56,672
...and provide every comfort you desire.

268
00:32:58,924 --> 00:33:00,962
I cannot wait to see Papa.

269
00:34:34,601 --> 00:34:35,714
Fire!

270
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,080
And again!

271
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,936
-I'm Major Duncan Heyward.
-Captain Jeffrey Beams.

272
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:27,239
-We didn't expect you to make it through.
-Let's go to Munro.

273
00:36:42,412 --> 00:36:43,394
Go, boys!

274
00:36:45,355 --> 00:36:46,403
Nathaniel!

275
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:49,545
It's torture, Jack!

276
00:36:50,956 --> 00:36:51,653
Uncas!

277
00:36:51,723 --> 00:36:54,026
Thought you and Nathaniel
weren't joining up.

278
00:36:54,124 --> 00:36:55,051
We didn't.

279
00:36:55,115 --> 00:36:58,245
We just dropped in
to see how you boys were doing.

280
00:37:04,364 --> 00:37:05,859
Papa!

281
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,685
Alice! Cora!

282
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,225
Why are you here?

283
00:37:09,323 --> 00:37:11,744
And where the hell are my reinforcements?

284
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:16,393
Get Mr. Phelps!

285
00:37:19,052 --> 00:37:20,578
I told you to stay away.

286
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:23,075
Why did you disobey me, girls?

287
00:37:23,435 --> 00:37:25,061
When? How, l....

288
00:37:25,226 --> 00:37:26,121
My letter.

289
00:37:26,187 --> 00:37:27,528
There was none.

290
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:29,024
-What?
-There was no letter.

291
00:37:29,131 --> 00:37:30,756
I sent three couriers to Webb.

292
00:37:30,827 --> 00:37:33,611
-One called Magua arrived.
-He delivered no such message.

293
00:37:33,676 --> 00:37:36,425
-Does Webb not know we are besieged?
-Webb has no idea.

294
00:37:36,524 --> 00:37:39,307
He certainly does not know
to send reinforcements.

295
00:37:48,971 --> 00:37:51,938
-What happened to you?
-On the George Road. Attacked.

296
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,507
We're fine.

297
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:56,202
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

298
00:37:57,226 --> 00:37:58,885
What will happen here, Papa?

299
00:37:58,954 --> 00:38:01,673
-We'll be all right, girl.
-This Magua led us into it.

300
00:38:01,772 --> 00:38:03,081
Eighteen killed.

301
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:05,798
These men came to our aid.
They guided us here.

302
00:38:09,932 --> 00:38:10,980
Thank you.

303
00:38:11,626 --> 00:38:12,903
Do you need anything?

304
00:38:13,003 --> 00:38:15,906
Can we help ourselves to a few horns
from your powder stores?

305
00:38:16,011 --> 00:38:16,960
And some food?

306
00:38:17,036 --> 00:38:18,180
I'm indebted to you.

307
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,718
Miss Cora, how are you?

308
00:38:24,907 --> 00:38:26,083
Hello, Mr. Phelps.

309
00:38:26,155 --> 00:38:28,490
Mrs. McCann will get
some dry clothes for you.

310
00:38:28,555 --> 00:38:29,637
Thank you.

311
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:33,512
Go with your sister, Alice.

312
00:38:37,196 --> 00:38:38,887
it'll be all right, girl.

313
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:41,343
it'll be all right.

314
00:38:54,635 --> 00:38:56,969
Might I inquire after the situation, sir...

315
00:38:57,034 --> 00:39:00,265
...given that I've seen the French
engineering from the ridge above?

316
00:39:00,557 --> 00:39:04,386
The situation is, his guns are bigger
than mine and he has more of them.

317
00:39:04,491 --> 00:39:07,875
They keep our heads down while his troops
dig 30 yards of trench a day.

318
00:39:07,948 --> 00:39:10,948
When those trenches are 200 yards
from the fort and in range...

319
00:39:11,052 --> 00:39:14,794
...he'll bring in his 15-inch mortars,
lob explosive rounds over our walls...

320
00:39:14,892 --> 00:39:16,320
...and pound us to dust.

321
00:39:16,715 --> 00:39:18,788
They look to be 300 yards out.

322
00:39:19,467 --> 00:39:22,336
If they're digging 30 yards a day,
you have three days.

323
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,419
Damn.

324
00:39:25,002 --> 00:39:27,873
A man here can make a run
straight through to Webb.

325
00:39:28,011 --> 00:39:31,458
Three days isn't enough to get to Albany
and back with reinforcements.

326
00:39:31,563 --> 00:39:33,025
Webb's not in Albany.

327
00:39:33,132 --> 00:39:36,034
He marched the 60th
to Fort Edward two days ago.

328
00:39:36,716 --> 00:39:38,122
Webb is at Edward?

329
00:39:38,282 --> 00:39:39,298
Yes, sir.

330
00:39:39,468 --> 00:39:40,875
That's only 12 miles away.

331
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:43,623
He could have reinforcements here
the day after tomorrow.

332
00:39:43,692 --> 00:39:46,790
You, sir. Pick your man.
Major Heyward will provide a diversion.

333
00:39:46,891 --> 00:39:48,233
I'll draft out a dispatch.

334
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,983
Captain Beams will seek you out
and give it to you later.

335
00:39:51,051 --> 00:39:52,034
Something else.

336
00:39:52,108 --> 00:39:56,167
Cameron's cabin. Frontier cabin.
Came upon it yesterday.

337
00:39:56,269 --> 00:40:00,807
It was burnt, everyone murdered.
It was Ottawa, allied to the French.

338
00:40:07,787 --> 00:40:08,584
So?

339
00:40:12,523 --> 00:40:13,930
It was a war party.

340
00:40:14,028 --> 00:40:17,475
That means they're going to be attacking
up and down the frontier.

341
00:40:18,156 --> 00:40:19,433
Thank you, sir.

342
00:40:19,564 --> 00:40:23,686
People here, Mohawks, settlers,
have family out there!

343
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,219
That'll be all, sir!

344
00:40:35,628 --> 00:40:38,016
Things were done. Nobody was spared.

345
00:40:41,035 --> 00:40:44,679
Those considerations are subordinate
to the interests of the Crown.

346
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:48,192
A terrible feature of war
here in the Americas, Major Heyward.

347
00:40:48,268 --> 00:40:51,431
Best keep your eye fixed on our duty,
to defeat France.

348
00:40:52,715 --> 00:40:54,821
That hangs on a courier to Webb.

349
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:16,106
I will give you three oxen for a feast.

350
00:41:16,587 --> 00:41:19,401
And tomorrow,
I will sing the war song with you...

351
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:21,769
...at the Great Council Fire.

352
00:41:37,804 --> 00:41:40,424
How are things with your English friends?

353
00:41:43,244 --> 00:41:47,400
The English war chief, Webb,
goes to Fort Edward with 60th Regiment.

354
00:41:48,555 --> 00:41:52,233
He does not know that my father's army
attacks Fort William Henry.

355
00:41:52,588 --> 00:41:54,247
Magua was successful?

356
00:41:55,916 --> 00:41:58,337
The other two couriers died in the forest.

357
00:42:00,043 --> 00:42:03,622
By now, Munro would know
his dispatch did not get through.

358
00:42:04,428 --> 00:42:05,857
He'll send another.

359
00:42:06,092 --> 00:42:07,782
The Grey Hair will try.

360
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,913
Four or five, including two women,
entered the fort.

361
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:16,487
The Grey Hair's children
were under Magua's knife. They escaped.

362
00:42:17,771 --> 00:42:19,910
They will be under it again.

363
00:42:20,492 --> 00:42:23,079
Why do you hate the Grey Hair, Magua?

364
00:42:25,612 --> 00:42:28,960
When the Grey Hair is dead,
Magua will eat his heart.

365
00:42:29,868 --> 00:42:34,340
Before he dies, Magua will put
his children under the knife...

366
00:42:35,628 --> 00:42:39,140
...so the Grey Hair will know
his seed is wiped out forever.

367
00:42:50,123 --> 00:42:51,532
Miss Cora?

368
00:42:52,556 --> 00:42:55,043
-Gentleman looking for you.
-Miss Munro.

369
00:42:58,924 --> 00:43:00,385
May l?

370
00:43:12,491 --> 00:43:14,913
It will seep and then it's going to draw.

371
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,328
Thank you, miss.

372
00:43:16,395 --> 00:43:18,785
About done holding hands
with Miss Munro?

373
00:43:20,237 --> 00:43:22,090
We got some work to do.

374
00:43:37,931 --> 00:43:39,841
What are you looking at, sir?

375
00:43:40,876 --> 00:43:42,949
I'm looking at you, miss.

376
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,959
Munro refused to believe what happened.

377
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:24,100
He does not even want to hear it.

378
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:27,940
Well, he's going to have to.

379
00:44:30,156 --> 00:44:35,304
Get together by the west bastion.
Ian, Sharitarish, Ongewasgone and William.

380
00:44:40,492 --> 00:44:41,866
Tight weave.

381
00:44:42,572 --> 00:44:44,328
Silk. Another 40 yards.

382
00:45:49,548 --> 00:45:52,232
And how am I to know
it wasn't a raid by common thieves?

383
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:55,748
The cabin was attacked by a war party
fighting with the French.

384
00:45:55,948 --> 00:45:59,745
They're sweeping south down the frontier,
attacking farms and Mohawk villages.

385
00:45:59,853 --> 00:46:01,258
All the men are stuck here.

386
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:03,463
I need more proof
than this man's opinion...

387
00:46:03,565 --> 00:46:06,281
...before I weaken the defenses
by releasing the militia.

388
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:08,715
Chingachgook's of the same opinion
about the raid.

389
00:46:08,779 --> 00:46:10,273
Taken together, that's gospel.

390
00:46:10,347 --> 00:46:13,577
Your fort will stand or fall,
depending on Webb's reinforcements...

391
00:46:13,644 --> 00:46:15,303
...not the presence of the colonials.

392
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:17,347
I judge military matters here! Not you!

393
00:46:17,452 --> 00:46:20,749
Your judgment isn't more important
than their right under agreement...

394
00:46:20,846 --> 00:46:23,233
...with Webb to defend their farms
and families.

395
00:46:23,307 --> 00:46:24,737
Major Heyward was there.

396
00:46:24,845 --> 00:46:27,082
He was at John Cameron's.
He saw what it was.

397
00:46:27,149 --> 00:46:28,806
What exactly did you see, Major?

398
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:39,172
I saw nothing that would lead me
to the conclusion it was other than...

399
00:46:39,244 --> 00:46:41,155
...a raid by savages bent on thievery.

400
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:42,695
You're a liar!

401
00:46:43,213 --> 00:46:44,739
Major!

402
00:46:45,196 --> 00:46:47,685
Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman,
not a butcher.

403
00:46:47,757 --> 00:46:51,171
It's easy for you to suppose. It's their
women and children alone, not yours!

404
00:46:51,244 --> 00:46:54,113
-You forget yourself!
-We're not forgetting Webb's promise.

405
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,879
British promises are honored.

406
00:46:56,108 --> 00:47:00,036
The militia won't be released.
I need more proof than this man's word.

407
00:47:00,236 --> 00:47:03,139
Nathaniel's word has been good
a long time before you got here.

408
00:47:03,277 --> 00:47:05,382
This meeting is over! The militia stays!

409
00:47:05,869 --> 00:47:08,389
Does the rule of English law
no longer govern?

410
00:47:09,611 --> 00:47:11,468
Has it been replaced by absolutism?

411
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:15,361
If English law can't be trusted, they better
making their own peace with the French.

412
00:47:15,436 --> 00:47:17,323
-That's sedition!
-That's the truth!

413
00:47:17,388 --> 00:47:19,212
I'll have you beaten from this fort!

414
00:47:22,988 --> 00:47:25,509
Someday we're going to have
a serious disagreement.

415
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,641
Anyone fomenting or advocating
leaving Fort William Henry...

416
00:47:28,715 --> 00:47:29,893
...will be hung for sedition.

417
00:47:29,964 --> 00:47:32,714
Anyone actually caught leaving
will be shot for desertion.

418
00:47:32,811 --> 00:47:35,332
And my decision is final. Get out!

419
00:47:48,653 --> 00:47:50,278
I wanted to talk to you.

420
00:47:52,684 --> 00:47:56,363
Talk to Duncan, Cora. I must manage.

421
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,275
I cannot be an invalid schoolgirl.

422
00:48:00,173 --> 00:48:02,147
I'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything.

423
00:48:03,372 --> 00:48:05,673
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to....

424
00:48:07,564 --> 00:48:09,704
When we come together back in England...

425
00:48:09,773 --> 00:48:11,944
...and are married
and away from this place...

426
00:48:12,012 --> 00:48:14,762
...what had to be done and said here
will matter not at all.

427
00:48:15,021 --> 00:48:16,199
I'm certain of that.

428
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:18,090
Duncan, I promised you an answer.

429
00:48:20,172 --> 00:48:23,369
You've complimented me
with your persistence and patience.

430
00:48:23,436 --> 00:48:25,161
But the decision I've come to is:

431
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:28,611
I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes
than surrender my own judgment.

432
00:48:30,957 --> 00:48:32,867
Please take this as my final answer.

433
00:48:34,155 --> 00:48:35,618
It must be no.

434
00:48:38,061 --> 00:48:39,009
I see.

435
00:49:13,357 --> 00:49:16,390
Yeah, Nathaniel,
but you weren't ever for being here.

436
00:49:16,493 --> 00:49:19,459
That's right. I saw it that way then
and I see it that way now.

437
00:49:19,918 --> 00:49:23,528
Ian, if I had kin in the settlements,
hell, I'd be damn sure I'd be long gone.

438
00:49:23,788 --> 00:49:26,177
What do we do
about being under Crown law?

439
00:49:26,284 --> 00:49:29,701
I believe if they set aside their law,
as and when they wish...

440
00:49:30,445 --> 00:49:33,444
...their law no longer has
rightful authority over us.

441
00:49:33,836 --> 00:49:36,106
All they have over us then, is tyranny.

442
00:49:36,525 --> 00:49:40,169
And I will not live under that yoke.
So I will stay here no longer.

443
00:49:41,869 --> 00:49:43,942
Anyone caught leaving the fort
could be shot...

444
00:49:44,013 --> 00:49:45,638
...so each man make a decision.

445
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,908
Those who are going, be back in an hour.

446
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,832
Out the northern sally-port.

447
00:49:50,188 --> 00:49:53,767
Strike for the east side of the swamp
till you clear the French picket line.

448
00:49:53,837 --> 00:49:56,805
Head north over the ridge,
then come about southeast.

449
00:49:57,005 --> 00:50:00,780
Fork left in Little Meadow and you're free
of the outpost and skirmishers.

450
00:50:00,845 --> 00:50:02,786
Should've skinned out of this long ago.

451
00:50:03,051 --> 00:50:07,145
We got no families, Captain.
We figured we'd stay and give a hand.

452
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:09,448
I'll cover you from the top of the bastion.

453
00:50:09,517 --> 00:50:10,924
You're not coming with us?

454
00:50:10,989 --> 00:50:12,299
I got a reason to stay.

455
00:50:13,293 --> 00:50:15,976
That reason wear a striped skirt
and work in the surgery?

456
00:50:16,045 --> 00:50:17,028
It does.

457
00:50:17,133 --> 00:50:20,548
No offense, but it's a better-looking reason
than you, Jack Winthrop.

458
00:50:21,515 --> 00:50:24,899
Push hard because you've got to clear
the French outpost by dawn.

459
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:26,980
Good luck, Jack.

460
00:50:38,414 --> 00:50:40,802
-Ongewasgone, are you staying?
-Yes.

461
00:50:40,877 --> 00:50:42,338
There's too many French.

462
00:50:42,445 --> 00:50:45,478
And so few of us to fight.
Not too many to die.

463
00:50:45,773 --> 00:50:48,490
But we've given our word
to our English fathers.

464
00:53:59,339 --> 00:54:00,747
As you were!

465
00:54:03,786 --> 00:54:05,097
Stand off.

466
00:54:10,763 --> 00:54:12,040
Take him.

467
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:21,825
As you were.

468
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:42,281
He saved us.
We're alive only because of him.

469
00:54:42,378 --> 00:54:46,306
He encouraged the colonials to desert
in this room and in my presence!

470
00:54:46,796 --> 00:54:48,453
-Sir!
-He's guilty of sedition.

471
00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:52,328
He must be tried like any criminal
regardless of what he did for my children.

472
00:54:52,394 --> 00:54:54,535
But he knew the consequences,
and he stayed.

473
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:56,800
Are those the actions of a criminal?

474
00:54:58,604 --> 00:54:59,813
Duncan, do something.

475
00:54:59,884 --> 00:55:03,812
He knew the penalty for his actions.
He should pay without sending you to beg.

476
00:55:04,489 --> 00:55:08,036
You know he wouldn't send me.
You falsely spoke of what you saw.

477
00:55:08,331 --> 00:55:10,599
What happened at the farm
was as Nathaniel said.

478
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:14,468
But not with enough certainty
to outweigh British interests in this fort.

479
00:55:14,538 --> 00:55:18,729
Who empowered these colonials
to pass judgment on England's policies...

480
00:55:18,795 --> 00:55:21,063
...in her own possessions,
and to come and go...

481
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:22,887
...without so much as a by-your-leave?

482
00:55:22,955 --> 00:55:25,224
They don't live their lives by your leave!

483
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:28,324
They hack it out of the wilderness
with their hands...

484
00:55:28,395 --> 00:55:30,152
...burying their children along the way.

485
00:55:30,219 --> 00:55:33,120
You're defending him because
you've become infatuated with him!

486
00:55:37,131 --> 00:55:40,032
You are a man
with a few admirable qualities.

487
00:55:40,298 --> 00:55:43,944
But taken as a whole, I was wrong
to have thought so highly of you.

488
00:55:48,874 --> 00:55:51,593
I would do anything I could
to keep you from being hurt.

489
00:55:52,107 --> 00:55:56,298
But he's guilty of sedition and subject
to military justice and beyond pardon.

490
00:55:58,316 --> 00:56:01,892
If that's justice, the sooner French guns
blow the English army out of America...

491
00:56:01,962 --> 00:56:03,457
...the better it'll be for people here.

492
00:56:03,531 --> 00:56:06,499
-You don't know what you're saying!
-I know exactly what I'm saying!

493
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:09,189
And if it's sedition,
then I am guilty of sedition, too.

494
00:56:39,434 --> 00:56:41,344
They're going to hang you.

495
00:56:44,587 --> 00:56:46,789
Why didn't you leave
when you had the chance?

496
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:52,552
Because what I'm interested in
is right here.

497
00:56:54,187 --> 00:56:55,528
What can I do?

498
00:56:56,268 --> 00:56:58,723
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.

499
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:01,927
If they do not arrive,
the fort will fall to the French.

500
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:04,612
If that happens, stay close to your father.

501
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:06,762
Stay close to him.

502
00:57:07,211 --> 00:57:10,725
The French officers will try to protect
the officers among the English.

503
00:57:10,795 --> 00:57:12,584
No. I will find you.

504
00:57:13,035 --> 00:57:14,245
Do not.

505
00:57:18,091 --> 00:57:19,238
Promise me.

506
00:57:33,803 --> 00:57:35,941
The whole world's on fire, isn't it?

507
00:59:01,676 --> 00:59:02,983
What is it?

508
00:59:04,364 --> 00:59:06,403
Remember what I told you.

509
00:59:07,371 --> 00:59:10,240
Stay close to your father and the officers.

510
00:59:17,131 --> 00:59:19,520
Company! Left face!

511
00:59:55,787 --> 00:59:59,617
Colonel Munro. I have known you
as a gallant antagonist.

512
01:00:00,204 --> 01:00:02,953
I am happy to make your acquaintance
as a friend.

513
01:00:03,083 --> 01:00:05,157
And I yours, Monsieur le Marquis.

514
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:09,537
You've already done everything which is
necessary for the honor of your prince...

515
01:00:10,122 --> 01:00:13,604
...but now I beg you to listen
to the admonishments of humanity.

516
01:00:13,836 --> 01:00:16,650
I beg you to consider my terms
for your surrender.

517
01:00:16,716 --> 01:00:19,945
Perhaps the General's glass
can reach as far as the Hudson...

518
01:00:20,044 --> 01:00:23,524
...and seize the size and eminence
of the army of Webb.

519
01:00:26,316 --> 01:00:29,663
My scouts intercepted
this dispatch intended for you.

520
01:00:31,212 --> 01:00:33,000
Captain de Bougainville.

521
01:00:33,355 --> 01:00:34,730
"To Colonel Munro:

522
01:00:34,891 --> 01:00:38,568
"Sir, I regret to inform you
that I have no men available...

523
01:00:38,699 --> 01:00:40,129
"...to send to your rescue.

524
01:00:40,268 --> 01:00:44,130
"It is quite impossible.
I advise you to seek terms for surrender.

525
01:00:44,812 --> 01:00:47,713
"I remain, Jerome Webb, at Fort Edward."

526
01:00:55,116 --> 01:00:56,840
This is the signature of Webb.

527
01:00:57,516 --> 01:00:59,206
And I know the temper of our men.

528
01:00:59,275 --> 01:01:02,276
Rather than spend the war
in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay...

529
01:01:02,348 --> 01:01:03,427
...they'd fight to the end.

530
01:01:03,499 --> 01:01:05,671
You've heard your answer,
Monsieur le Marquis.

531
01:01:06,731 --> 01:01:09,220
I beg you not to sign
the death warrant of so many...

532
01:01:09,292 --> 01:01:11,114
...to what I have to say.

533
01:01:17,068 --> 01:01:18,247
Go on.

534
01:01:18,637 --> 01:01:21,419
None of your men will see
the inside of a prison barge.

535
01:01:22,476 --> 01:01:23,621
They are free...

536
01:01:24,044 --> 01:01:28,070
...so long as they return to England
and fight no more on this continent...

537
01:01:28,876 --> 01:01:31,910
...and the civilian militia
return to their farms.

538
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:35,071
Their arms?

539
01:01:35,147 --> 01:01:37,156
They may leave the fortress fully armed.

540
01:01:38,604 --> 01:01:39,913
My colors?

541
01:01:40,268 --> 01:01:42,655
Carry them to England with pride.

542
01:01:45,931 --> 01:01:48,168
Allow me to consult with my officers.

543
01:01:58,603 --> 01:02:01,538
I have lived to see something
which I never expected.

544
01:02:02,476 --> 01:02:06,187
-A British officer afraid to support another.
-Webb can burn in hell.

545
01:02:06,284 --> 01:02:09,633
And we'll go back and dig our graves
behind those ramparts.

546
01:02:11,563 --> 01:02:14,117
Death and honor
are thought to be the same...

547
01:02:16,396 --> 01:02:19,210
...but today I have learned
that sometimes they are not.

548
01:02:19,276 --> 01:02:19,941
Sir?

549
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:02,275
ls the hatchet buried
between the English and my French father?

550
01:03:02,347 --> 01:03:03,363
Yes.

551
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:07,370
Not a warrior has a scalp,
and the white men become friends.

552
01:03:07,948 --> 01:03:12,224
My master owns these lands,
and I have been ordered to drive off...

553
01:03:12,364 --> 01:03:13,991
...the English squatters.

554
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:18,631
They have consented to go,
so now I call them enemies no longer.

555
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:23,620
Magua took the hatchet
to color with blood. It's still bright.

556
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:27,300
Only when it's red, then it will be buried.

557
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:31,623
So many suns have set
since Magua struck the war post.

558
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:34,019
And where is that sun?

559
01:03:34,285 --> 01:03:38,114
Magua is the son of his people
and he has come to lead many of them!

560
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:43,467
But Magua has power with his Huron
people and others here, I know well.

561
01:03:50,989 --> 01:03:53,768
Magua's village and lodges were burnt.

562
01:03:56,524 --> 01:03:59,393
Magua's children
were killed by the English.

563
01:04:01,548 --> 01:04:05,345
I was taken as slave by the Mohawk,
who fought for the Grey Hair.

564
01:04:08,268 --> 01:04:11,717
Magua's wife believed he was dead...

565
01:04:14,764 --> 01:04:16,837
...and became the wife of another.

566
01:04:18,731 --> 01:04:20,771
The Grey Hair was the father of all that.

567
01:04:21,836 --> 01:04:22,916
In time...

568
01:04:24,044 --> 01:04:28,321
...Magua became blood brother
to the Mohawk, to become free.

569
01:04:29,516 --> 01:04:32,682
But always in his heart he is Huron!

570
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:38,307
And his heart will be whole again
on the day...

571
01:04:40,012 --> 01:04:42,434
...the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead.

572
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:53,220
Does the chief of the Canadas believe
the English will keep the terms?

573
01:04:57,932 --> 01:04:59,392
Colonel Munro would...

574
01:05:00,524 --> 01:05:03,753
...but General Webb
will not honor the agreement...

575
01:05:04,877 --> 01:05:07,844
...and send their soldiers away.

576
01:05:08,012 --> 01:05:11,787
I fear having let them go, which I must...

577
01:05:12,556 --> 01:05:17,194
...I will only fight the same men again
when I drive towards Albany.

578
01:05:55,371 --> 01:05:58,089
Monsieur, the fort is yours.

579
01:09:45,835 --> 01:09:47,266
Fire!

580
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:06,348
Grey Hair.

581
01:12:07,085 --> 01:12:10,915
Before you die, know that I will put
under the knife your children...

582
01:12:10,989 --> 01:12:13,837
...so I will wipe your seed
from the earth forever.

583
01:14:26,989 --> 01:14:29,858
Got nothing better to do
on the lake today, Major?

584
01:14:30,317 --> 01:14:33,765
When you fall into British hands again
I'll have you hanged!

585
01:14:44,014 --> 01:14:44,996
Faster!

586
01:14:57,262 --> 01:14:58,374
Take to the river!

587
01:17:06,542 --> 01:17:08,068
-Where are we going?
-Nowhere.

588
01:17:08,141 --> 01:17:09,286
I don't understand.

589
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:12,107
This is as far as we go!
If we're lucky, they'll figure...

590
01:17:12,173 --> 01:17:14,442
...we beached our canoes
and headed across land.

591
01:17:14,509 --> 01:17:17,030
If we're lucky,
they'll figure we went over the falls.

592
01:17:17,102 --> 01:17:18,924
Our only hope is they pass us by.

593
01:17:19,053 --> 01:17:21,954
-If they do?
-Take the south rim down the mountain.

594
01:17:22,766 --> 01:17:24,936
It's 12 miles cross-country to Fort Edward.

595
01:17:25,229 --> 01:17:26,375
And if they don't?

596
01:17:28,044 --> 01:17:31,012
You'll just have to forego
the pleasure of hanging me.

597
01:17:35,406 --> 01:17:36,388
Any powder?

598
01:17:46,766 --> 01:17:47,748
Done.

599
01:17:50,413 --> 01:17:52,105
Mine's soaking wet!

600
01:17:52,878 --> 01:17:53,892
Our father?

601
01:17:55,949 --> 01:17:57,673
Did you see my father?

602
01:17:58,797 --> 01:18:00,259
From a distance.

603
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:31,627
Say nothing to Alice.

604
01:18:53,166 --> 01:18:54,343
Get back!

605
01:19:47,822 --> 01:19:49,229
Go ahead!

606
01:19:49,678 --> 01:19:51,619
What the bloody-hell plan is this?

607
01:19:51,726 --> 01:19:53,002
I want you to go!

608
01:19:53,101 --> 01:19:55,436
If we go there's a chance
there won't be a fight!

609
01:19:55,502 --> 01:19:59,332
There's no powder! If we don't go,
then there's no chance! None!

610
01:19:59,407 --> 01:20:00,682
You understand?

611
01:20:00,749 --> 01:20:01,643
Coward!

612
01:20:02,191 --> 01:20:05,126
You've done everything you can do.
Save yourself!

613
01:20:08,269 --> 01:20:09,928
If the worst happens...

614
01:20:09,998 --> 01:20:13,773
...and only one of us survives,
something of the other does, too.

615
01:20:13,965 --> 01:20:16,234
No! You stay alive!

616
01:20:16,718 --> 01:20:20,329
If they don't kill you, they'll take you
north up to the Huron lands.

617
01:20:20,718 --> 01:20:22,953
Submit, do you hear? You're strong!

618
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,429
You survive!

619
01:20:25,741 --> 01:20:30,695
Stay alive, no matter what occurs!
I will find you!

620
01:20:31,758 --> 01:20:34,726
No matter how long it takes.
No matter how far.

621
01:20:36,237 --> 01:20:38,180
I will find you!

622
01:27:32,749 --> 01:27:33,961
I don't speak Huron.

623
01:27:34,031 --> 01:27:35,404
-You speak French, Major?
-Yes.

624
01:27:35,468 --> 01:27:37,926
Translate for me into French
every word as I say it.

625
01:27:38,413 --> 01:27:43,750
I come to you unarmed and in peace
to unstop your ears, Sachem.

626
01:27:43,823 --> 01:27:46,573
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro
go free.

627
01:27:46,895 --> 01:27:50,277
Take fire out of the English anger
over the murder of their helpless ones.

628
01:28:01,007 --> 01:28:04,835
Sachem, the French fathers made peace.
Magua broke it!

629
01:28:04,973 --> 01:28:07,757
It is false that the French
will be friends still to the Huron.

630
01:28:52,686 --> 01:28:56,069
Would Magua use the ways
of Les Franais and the Yengeese?

631
01:28:57,358 --> 01:28:58,504
-Would you?
-Yes!

632
01:28:58,606 --> 01:29:00,494
Would the Huron
make his Algonquin brothers...

633
01:29:00,558 --> 01:29:04,998
...foolish with brandy and steal his lands
to sell them for gold to the white man?

634
01:29:05,486 --> 01:29:08,171
Would Huron have greed for more land
than a man can use?

635
01:29:09,647 --> 01:29:11,556
Would Huron fool Seneca into taking...

636
01:29:11,631 --> 01:29:15,755
...all the furs of all the animals of the forest
for beads and strong whiskey?

637
01:29:15,856 --> 01:29:19,238
Would the Huron kill every man,
woman and child of their enemy?

638
01:29:19,311 --> 01:29:21,318
Those are the ways of the Yengeese...

639
01:29:21,391 --> 01:29:24,357
...and the Franais traders
and their masters in Europe...

640
01:29:24,430 --> 01:29:26,765
...infected with the sickness of greed!

641
01:29:28,527 --> 01:29:30,152
Magua's heart is twisted.

642
01:29:31,054 --> 01:29:33,542
He would make himself
into what twisted him.

643
01:29:35,568 --> 01:29:37,509
I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese.

644
01:29:37,713 --> 01:29:41,028
Hawkeye, adopted son
of Chingachgook of the Mohican people.

645
01:29:41,104 --> 01:29:44,780
Let the children of the dead Munro
and the Yengeese officer go free.

646
01:29:45,871 --> 01:29:50,279
This belt which is a record of the days
of my father's people speaks for my truth.

647
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:12,548
Tell him I'll trade him. Me for her! Say it!

648
01:31:29,519 --> 01:31:33,481
I am La Longue Carabine!
My death is a great honor to the Huron!

649
01:31:33,552 --> 01:31:35,339
Take me!

650
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,036
You tell him?

651
01:31:39,631 --> 01:31:40,876
Yes.

652
01:31:57,294 --> 01:31:58,472
Take me!

653
01:31:59,792 --> 01:32:02,791
Take me! My compliments, sir!
Take her and get out!

654
01:32:02,895 --> 01:32:06,092
Duncan! What are they doing to Duncan?
Where's Alice?

655
01:40:18,514 --> 01:40:20,969
Great Spirit and the Maker of all Life...

656
01:40:24,304 --> 01:40:28,560
...a warrior goes to you swift
and straight as an arrow shot into the sun.

657
01:40:29,967 --> 01:40:34,922
Welcome him, and let him take his place
at the Council Fire of my people.

658
01:40:37,391 --> 01:40:40,874
He is Uncas, my son.

659
01:40:42,866 --> 01:40:46,028
Tell him to be patient
and ask death for speed...

660
01:40:47,185 --> 01:40:53,097
...for they are all there but one,
I, Chingachgook...

661
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,172
...the last of the Mohicans.
