What is your first name,
your last name?

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,749
My name is Yuri Zhary.

5
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,075
Where did you come from?

6
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,749
I came from Kharkov.

7
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,676
What school do you go to?

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,750
I go to a technical school.

9
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,510
Now we're going
to have a seance.

10
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,757
You just look at me.

11
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,439
Look me in the eye.

12
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,429
Look in front ofyou.

13
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,078
Turn around, with your back to me.

14
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,440
Concentrate on my hand.

15
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,438
My hand is drawing you back.

16
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,072
Spread your hands.

17
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,435
Concentrate. All your tension
is centered in your hands.

18
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,236
Your hands are strained!

19
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,829
Concentrate all ofyour
will power,

20
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,235
your big desire to win,
on your hands.

21
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,592
Your hands are getting
more and more tense.

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,995
They're very tense.
Still more tense.

23
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:43,228
Look at your fingers.
Your fingers are tense.

24
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,236
From here the tension passes on
to your fingers.

25
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,996
Look at your hands.
Yura, concentrate!

26
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,069
On my count ofthree
your hands will become immobile.

27
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,431
One, two, three!
Your hands don't move.

28
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,676
You can't move them.

29
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,077
You're trying to move your hands,
but they're fixed.

30
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,432
It's very hard for you
to make a slightest movement.

31
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,916
Now I'm going to lift
this transfixion,

32
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,229
and you'll be able to speak
freely, easily and articulately.

33
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:34,833
From now on you will speak
loudly and clearly.

34
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,073
Look at me.

35
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,990
I'm lifting the tension
from your hands and your speech.

36
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,155
One, two, three!

37
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,517
Go ahead, say loudly and clearly:
I can speak!

MIRROR

56
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,238
The road from the station
passed through lgnatievo,

57
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,439
then swerved near the farm

58
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,154
we had lived on each summer
before the war,

59
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,429
and through a dense oak forest
went on as far as Tomshino.

60
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,076
Usually we spotted our people

61
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,829
as soon as they appeared from
behind a bush in the mid-field.

62
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,432
If he turned from the bush
towards our house, then it's father.

63
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,076
If not, it meant it was not father

64
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,919
and that father would never come.

65
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,588
Am I going the right way
to Tomshino?

66
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,840
You shouldn't have taken a turn
at the bush.

67
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,234
- And this...What's this?..
- What?

68
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,676
Why are you sitting here?

69
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,430
- I live here.
- Where? On the fence?

70
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,591
Are you interested in the way to
Tomshino or where I live?

71
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:17,510
I brought all the instruments,
but forgot the key.

72
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,589
Do you happen to have a nail
or a screw-driver?

73
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,998
I don't have any nails.

74
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,076
Why are you so nervous?

75
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,755
Give me your hand. I'm a doctor.

76
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,076
You're bothering me.

77
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,236
Do you want me to call my husband?

78
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:48,431
You haven't got any husband.
There's no ring.

79
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,236
Though people don't wear rings
nowadays. Maybe only old people.

80
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,835
May I have a cigarette?

81
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,437
Why do you look so sad?

82
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,836
And why do you look so happy?

83
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,670
It's a pleasure to fall down
with an attractive woman.

84
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,830
You know, I fell and found
strange things here - roots, bushes...

85
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,236
Has it ever occurred to you

86
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:08,228
that plants can feel, know,
even comprehend...

87
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,438
The trees, this hazel-nut bush...

88
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,440
- This is the alder-tree.
- It doesn't matter.

89
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,437
They don't run about.

90
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,917
Like us who are rushing, fussing,
uttering banalities.

91
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,235
That's because we don't trust
nature that is inside us.

92
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,919
Always this suspiciousness,
haste,

93
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,440
and no time
to stop and think.

94
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,236
Look, you seem to be a bit...

95
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,237
It's no problem for me.
I'm a doctor.

96
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,756
And what about "Ward Number Six"?

97
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,837
Oh, Chekhov had made it all up!

98
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:12,069
Come to Tomshino sometime.
We often have a good time there.

99
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,838
You've got blood!

100
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,155
- Where?
- Behind your ear.

101
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,158
Each moment of our dates, not many,

102
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,158
We celebrated as an Epiphany.

103
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,432
Alone in the whole world.

104
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,273
More daring and lighter
than a bird

105
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,914
Down the stairs, like a dizzy
apparition,

106
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,078
You came to take me on your road,
Through rain-soaked lilacs,

107
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,158
To your own possession,
To the looking glass world.

108
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,596
As night descended

109
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,075
I was blessed with grace,

110
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,918
The altar gate opened up,

111
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,839
And in the darkness shining

112
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,600
And slowly reclining
Was your body naked.

113
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,270
On waking up I said:
God bless you!

114
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,517
Although I knew how daring
and undue

115
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,280
My blessing was: You were fast
asleep,

116
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,074
Your closed eyelids
with the universal blue

117
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,316
The lilac on the table
so strained to sweep.

118
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,074
Touched by the blue, your lids

119
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,590
Were quite serene, your hand was
warm.

120
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,519
And rivers pulsed in crystal slits,

121
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,837
Mountains smoked, and oceans
swarmed.

122
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,840
You held a sphere in your palm,

123
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,077
Of crystal; on your throne
you were sleeping calm.

124
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,438
And, oh my God! -
Belonging only to me,

125
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,155
You woke and at once transformed

126
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,920
The language humans speak and think.

127
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,158
Speech rushed up sonorously formed,

128
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,750
With the word "you" so much
reformed

129
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,509
As to evolve a new sense meaning
king.

130
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,439
And suddenly all changed,
like in a trance,

131
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,598
Even trivial things,
so often used and tried,

132
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,234
When standing 'tween us,
guarding us,

133
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,313
Was water, solid, stratified.

134
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,075
It carried us I don't know where.

135
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,999
Retreating before us, like some
mirage,

136
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,156
Were cities, miraculously fair.

137
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,438
Under our feet the mint grass spread,

138
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,836
The birds were following our tread,

139
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,998
The fishes came to a river bend,

140
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,839
And to our eyes the sky was open.

141
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,318
Behind us our fate was groping,

142
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,678
Like an insane man with a razor
in his hand.

143
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,235
Oh, good heavens! Dounya!

144
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,748
What is it, Pasha?!

145
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,996
A fire! But be quiet.

146
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,233
He'll get it coming to him!

147
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,315
And what ifVitya is in there?
What if he's burned?

148
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,438
Where's Klanya?

149
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,075
What?

150
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,429
Dad!

151
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,430
- Alexei?
- Hello, ma!

152
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,596
What's wrong with your voice?

153
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,237
Nothing serious.
I guess it's just a sore throat.

154
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,676
I haven't spoken to anyone
for three days.

155
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,917
I even liked it. I think it's good
to keep silent for a while.

156
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,836
Words can't express everything

157
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,919
a person feels.
Words are flaccid.

158
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,075
I just dreamed ofyou in my sleep.

159
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,072
As though I were still a child...

160
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,070
By the way, what year was it
when dad left us?

161
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,749
1935. Why?

162
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,509
And the fire? Remember the hay-loft
that burned down at the farm?

163
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,676
That was in '35 too.

164
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,670
All right, stop pulling the wool
over my eyes.

165
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,316
You know... Lisa died.

166
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:34,831
The one I worked in the printing
house with.

167
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,830
- Oh God... When?
- This morning, at 7.

168
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,317
And what time is it now?
What is now?

169
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,159
- Almost six.
- In the morning?

170
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,995
What's the matter with you?
ln the evening.

171
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,238
Mom, why do we have to fight
all the time?

172
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,679
I'm sorry if I did anything wrong.

173
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,430
Printing-house.
Next stop: Serpukhovskaya.

174
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,316
What's the rush?

175
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,599
Hello.

176
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,153
Where're the proofs
I've been reading?

177
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,672
I don't know. Just a minute.

178
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,156
Yelizaveta Pavlovna is here.

179
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,838
Marousia, what's wrong?

180
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,836
Something in yesterday's proofs?

181
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,314
In the Goslit edition?
Don't be so nervous!

182
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,236
We should look in the typesetting
case.

183
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,677
Nothing terrible has happened.

184
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,149
It's such an important edition!

185
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,154
Although misprints have no place
in any edition.

186
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,758
Shut up, you idiot.

187
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,760
- What happened?
- Nothing serious.

188
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,080
I just want to check something.
I may be wrong...

189
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,236
Let's start from the beginning.

190
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,996
I'd rather do it myself.

191
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,158
Everybody's rushing,
no one's got any time!

192
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,758
You think I'm afraid?

193
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,428
No, let other people
be afraid.

194
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,076
Some people should work,
and others should be afraid.

195
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,232
Well, nothing awful has happened.

196
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,233
If it happened, it happened.
We've been printing all night...

197
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,509
I waited for you since yesterday's
morning.

198
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,679
That you won't come they probably
guessed.

199
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,429
Remember what a beautiful weather
it was?

200
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,677
A holiday weather!
And I walked coatless.

201
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,999
Today you're here, and they have
arranged

202
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,079
An utterly gloomy and cloudy day,

203
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,238
It rains, and it's getting unusually
late,

204
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,076
The rain drops run down the cold
terrain,

205
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,759
Unsoothable by word, unwipable
by hand...

206
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:11,993
You see, it wasn't there, was it?
Everything is all right.

207
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,751
It wasn't...
That would've been a horrid mistake.

208
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,837
Why are you crying then?

209
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:25,434
I even saw that word typeset.

210
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,834
What word?

211
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,598
Great!

212
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,439
This is pure alcohol.
Not much, but it might help.

213
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,996
You've got all drenched up.
You look like a scarecrow!

214
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,510
Really, I'm all wet.

215
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:11,992
I guess I'll go and take a shower.
Where's my comb?

216
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,431
You know who you resemble now?

217
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,429
- Who?
- Maria Timofeyevna.

218
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,232
What Maria Timofeyevna?

219
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,758
Here. You've been looking for
your comb, haven't you?

220
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,920
Tell me, who's Maria Timofeyevna?

221
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,673
There was such a woman,
Captain Lebyadkin's sister.

222
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,235
You're the spitting image
of Lebyadkina.

223
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,599
In what way do I resemble her?

224
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:58,156
Yes, Fyodor Mikhailovich was...
Whatever you may say...

225
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,839
What?

226
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,232
Lebyadkin, bring some water!

227
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:09,828
The difference is her brother would
not bring her water, but beat her.

228
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,914
Explain it. I don't understand.

229
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,834
All your life is just that
"bring some water!"

230
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,756
Just an appearance of independence.

231
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,076
If something doesn't suit you,

232
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,068
you pretend
it doesn't exist.

233
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,996
What nonsense you're talking!

234
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,839
I'm amazed at the patience
ofyour ex-husband.

235
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,079
He should have run away
much sooner.

236
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,838
What do you want from me?

237
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,749
Have you ever admitted
you were wrong? Never!

238
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,317
You just made up
this whole situation!

239
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,590
As long as you haven't succeeded
in elevating your dear husband

240
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,431
to this nonsensical emancipated
condition ofyours,

241
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,835
then you can be sure
he has been saved just in time.

242
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,997
As for your children, you will
definitely make them miserable.

243
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,236
Stop this idiocy!

244
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,995
Come on now, Masha!

245
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,596
Leave me alone!

246
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,153
My earthly life traversed but
by a half,

247
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,439
I found myself lost in a twilight
forest...

248
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:18,873
I always said
that you resemble my mother.

249
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,156
Apparently, that's the reason
we divorced.

250
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,432
I notice with horror how much
lgnat is becoming like you.

251
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,996
Why with horror?

252
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,988
We two could never talk
like normal human beings.

253
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,432
When I recall my childhood
and my mother,

254
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,599
somehow she always has your face.

255
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,836
I know why though.

256
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,157
I pity you both,
you and her.

257
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,759
Why?

258
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,068
Ignat, put the glass down!

259
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,429
You won't be able to live
a normal life with anyone.

260
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,312
Probably.

261
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,989
Don't feel offended.
You seem to be convinced

262
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,998
that the very fact
ofyour existence close by

263
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,516
will make everybody happy.

264
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,438
You only know how to demand.

265
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,590
That's because I was brought up
by women.

266
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,238
Ifyou don't want lgnat
to become like that,

267
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,436
get married as soon as possible.

268
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,920
- Get married to whom?
- This I don't know.

269
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,996
Or give lgnat to me.

270
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,829
Why didn't you make it up with
your mother? It was your fault.

271
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,590
What fault?

272
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,838
She's convinced herself she knows
better than I how I should live.

273
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,078
That she can make me happy.

274
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:11,077
As far as mother is concerned,
I can feel it better than you.

275
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,076
What can you feel better?

276
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,840
That we're getting more and more
distant,

277
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,154
and I can't do anything
about it.

278
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:45,068
Natalya, try to distract him.
He's talking of Spain again.

279
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,430
It will end up in a scandal.

280
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:56,079
I wanted to ask you for a favor...
We're redecorating now.

281
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,909
Ignat wants to live with you
for a week.

282
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,509
I will be very happy.

283
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,598
What does he say?

284
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,837
He's showing the great matador
Palomo Linares.

285
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,349
Most of all he was excited
by the farewell he was given.

286
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,438
The whole town came to see him off.
People sang and danced.

287
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,439
His mother couldn't come,
she was sick.

288
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:34,435
And his father stood aside,
sad and silent.

289
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,319
He knew they were thinking
the same thing:

290
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,074
that they probably will never
see each other again.

291
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,519
Are you mocking at us or what?

292
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,758
We taught you and taught
and it was no use.

293
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,916
Now it turns out you can!

294
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,237
He went to Spain and didn't
understand anything.

295
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,078
Did you ever want
to go back to Spain?

296
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,679
I can't go, I've got a Russian
husband.

297
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,438
And Russian children.

298
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,839
I'll talk to her myself!

299
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,315
Ignat!

300
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,998
Come here. I'm leaving.

301
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,915
Always in a hurry...

302
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,236
Don't put it together, just give it
to me like that.

303
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:17,318
- Oh, I felt an electric shock.
- What shock?

304
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,838
As if it had already happened...

305
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,756
But I've never been here before.

306
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,917
Come on, give me the money
and stop dreaming.

307
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,429
Clean up a bit,
make the place tidy.

308
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,431
Don't touch anything here.

309
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,590
If Maria Nikolaevna comes
tell her to wait for me.

310
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,759
Come in. How are you?

311
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,158
May we have another cup
for the young man?

312
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:15,080
Take the notebook from the third
shelf in the bookcase, will you?

313
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,237
Read from the page that is marked
with a ribbon.

314
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:39,274
"To the question how sciences
and arts affect

315
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,278
people's morals, Rousseau answered:
Negatively'."

316
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,429
Read only what is underlined
with the red pencil.

317
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,830
"Notwithstanding the..."
Oh no!

318
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,510
"The division of churches
separated us from Europe.

319
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,916
We remained excluded

320
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:06,913
from every great event
that had shaken it.

321
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:12,235
However, we had our own,
special destiny.

322
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,358
Russia, with her immense territory,

323
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,075
had swallowed up the Mongol
invasion.

324
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:26,073
The Tartars didn't dare
crossing our western borders.

325
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,430
They retreated to their wilderness

326
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,677
and Christian civilization
had been saved.

327
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,830
To attain that goal
we had to lead

328
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,430
a special kind of life
which, while leaving us Christians,

329
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:48,318
had made us alien
to the Christian world.

330
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,917
As for our historic
insignificance,

331
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,509
I cannot agree with you on that.

332
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:00,316
Don't you find
anything significant at all

333
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,835
in today's situation in Russia

334
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,998
that would strike
a future historian?

335
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:11,235
Although I'm heartily attached
to our sovereign,

336
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:16,829
I'm not at all delighted with
everything I see around me.

337
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:23,990
As a man of letters,
I'm being annoyed, insulted,

338
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:29,354
but I swear that for nothing
in the world would have made me

339
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,836
change my home country
or have any other history

340
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,156
than the history of our forbears,

341
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,828
such as it was given us by God."

342
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:44,157
From Pushkin's letter to Chaadayev.
October 19, 1836.

343
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,518
Go, open up.

344
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,675
I'm afraid I've got the wrong
address.

345
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,668
Ignat, how are you doing?

346
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,596
Did Maria Nikolaevna come?

347
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,828
No. Though some woman came,
but she's got the wrong apartment.

348
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:30,593
Find something to do
or invite somebody.

349
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,509
Do you know any girls?

350
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,837
You mean from my class?
Oh no!

351
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:41,591
At your age I was already in love...
During the war...

352
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,590
With a redhead...
Her lips were always blistered.

353
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,234
Our military instructor was chasing
after her, he was shell-shocked.

354
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,679
Are you listening to me?

355
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,678
What did you fire at?
You think I didn't see it?

356
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,679
You were firing up!

357
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,999
What's wrong with that?
There's no one there.

358
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,758
And what if somebody was there?

359
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,072
There're only trees there.

360
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,236
And what if somebody climbed a tree?

361
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:27,593
About face! I commanded
"about face"!

362
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,509
Put down your rifle.

363
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,996
That's what I did.

364
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:40,236
Did you learn drill regulations?

365
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:48,431
About face in Russian means
exactly what I did.

366
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:55,593
About face means a turn of
360 degrees.

367
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,840
What degrees? About face!

368
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,156
To the firing position
forward march!

369
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,234
I'm going to send you
for your parents.

370
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,997
What parents?

371
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,436
You'll know very soon
what parents.

372
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,918
What is the firing position?

373
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,430
Down on the floor mat!

374
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,438
His parents died during the siege.

375
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:52,592
The firing position is...
a firing position.

376
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,916
- Markov!
- Yes, sir!

377
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,995
Name the basic elements of...

378
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,516
The rifle.

379
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,993
The butt.

380
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,677
- The muzzle.
- It's you who's a muzzle.

381
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,516
What is the muzzle then?

382
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,589
Guys! A grenade!

383
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,998
It's a hand grenade!

384
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,519
Don't do it!

385
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,237
Down on the ground!

386
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,232
You'll be killed!

387
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,072
It's only a dummy grenade.

388
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:50,316
And you say you're from Leningrad
and been under the siege...

389
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,836
I don't believe in premonitions.

390
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:49,669
I have no trust in superstitions.

391
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,997
I don't run from slander or venom.

392
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,078
There's no death on earth.

393
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,079
All are immortal,
Everything's immortal.

394
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,840
Don't be afraid of death
at seventeen,

395
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:04,510
At seventy as well...
There's just reality and light.

396
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,998
There's neither death nor darkness
in this world.

397
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,749
At last we all have reached the shore,

398
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,920
And I'm the one who casts a fishing
rod

399
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,429
When immortality is coming
in a shoal.

400
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,917
Live in a house, and it'll never
fall.

401
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,675
To any ofthe centuries I'd nod

402
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,599
And enter it, a house I'd install.

403
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,588
That's why with me your children
share board,

404
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,155
Your wives join me at my table,
and all.

405
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:34,518
One table serves both granddad and
grandchild:

406
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,519
The future's being made right now.

407
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,314
Whenever I'm to raise my hand
in tide,

408
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,313
I all five rays of it on you bestow.

409
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,758
With collarbones, as ifwith
timber work,

410
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,428
I propped up every day of past age.

411
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,519
I measured time by a world-wide
walk,

412
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,439
I passed through it like through
the Urals range.

413
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,074
I chose the age up to my own measure.

414
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:01,829
We headed south, with dust flying
away,

415
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,839
The weeds smoked up, and at his own
leisure,

416
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,429
His feeler on the horseshoe,
the grasshopper forecast...

417
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,599
He prophesied me death, as if
he were a monk.

418
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,598
But with my fate strapped to my
saddle fast,

419
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,314
I'm riding now in the time to come

420
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,829
And surging on the stirrups to my
own drum.

421
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,994
My immortality is quite enough
for me.

422
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,233
For my own blood to flow ages
through,

423
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,154
For steady warmth and a haven
safe and true

424
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,835
I'd give my life self-willingly and
freely,

425
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,679
Had not its volatile, needle-like
sword

426
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,678
Been leading me, like a thread,
throughout the world.

427
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:47,829
Marousia? And the children?

428
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,314
Where are the children?

429
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,231
I'm going to tell everybody
that you've stolen the book.

430
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:04,995
- What?
- I will, you'll see.

431
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:13,512
- Now stop it!
- Go on, tell everybody!

432
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,996
I will, anyway!

433
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,076
Marina!

434
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,758
You could have come more often.
You know that he's missing you.

435
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:57,070
Let lgnat live with me.

436
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:02,993
Are you serious?

437
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:07,154
You said yourself
that he would like to.

438
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,836
With you it's better to keep one's
mouth shut.

439
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,829
You mean I'm inventing this
for my own pleasure?

440
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:19,509
Let's ask him.
Whatever he decides...

441
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,436
Besides, it will make your life
much easier.

442
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,678
Why would this make it easier for me?

443
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,312
Have you collected your books?

444
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,757
Go say goodbye to your father.

445
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:43,757
Your mother and I would like
to ask you...

446
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:45,915
What?

447
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,155
Wouldn't it be better ifyou lived
with me?

448
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:53,833
How?

449
01:06:54,800 --> 01:07:00,432
You and I will live together.
Haven't you said so to your mother?

450
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:06,229
Said what? When?
No, please.

451
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,510
We really look alike,
don't we?

452
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:42,998
Not at all!

453
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:04,432
What do you want from your mother?
What kind of relationship?

454
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,997
The kind of relationship you had
in your childhood is impossible.

455
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:27,069
You speak of some feeling of
guilt,

456
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,236
of her life being ruined because of
you...

457
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,756
Well, you can't get away from it.

458
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:38,829
And what she needs is for you
to become a baby again,

459
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,510
for her to be able to carry you
and protect you.

460
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:50,430
Why on earth am I meddling in it?

461
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,313
It's always like this...

462
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,839
Why are you whimpering?
Explain it.

463
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:12,154
Should I marry him or not?

464
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:23,830
- Do I know him?
- No...

465
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,439
Is he Ukrainian?

466
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,837
Does it matter?

467
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:34,910
- What is he doing?
- He is a writer.

468
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,508
Doesn't his name happen to be
Dostoyevsky?

469
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,233
Yes, Dostoyevsky.

470
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:46,591
He hasn't written anything
worthwhile. Nobody knows him.

471
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:50,238
He must be about 40, isn't he?
Apparently he's got no talent?

472
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,996
You've changed so much.

473
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,233
So, he has no talent, he doesn't write
anything.

474
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,436
He does write, but they don't
publish him.

475
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:11,828
Look, our precious flunk
has put something on fire.

476
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:18,234
No need to be so ironic about
his flunking.

477
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,835
If he doesn't finish school,
he'll end up being drafted.

478
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,430
And you will go begging
to have him exempted from the army.

479
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,995
This is all the result ofyour
indulging him.

480
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,829
By the way, the army would be
good for him.

481
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,837
Why don't you call your mother?

482
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,078
After Aunt Lisa's death she stayed
in bed for three days.

483
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:44,237
Wasn't she supposed to come here
at five?

484
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,439
Is it so difficult
to make the first move?

485
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,430
We were talking about lgnat.

486
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,756
It may be my fault, too.

487
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,516
Or is it because we got so bourgeois?

488
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:11,593
And our embourgeoisement is
so dense, so Asian.

489
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,078
With private ownership nonexistent,
our well-being is on the rise.

490
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,072
Nothing makes any sense anymore.

491
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,237
Why do you get so irritated?

492
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:22,996
I know a family
whose 15-year-old son said:

493
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,430
"I'm leaving you.
It disgusts me to see

494
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,756
how you weasel around
trying to please everybody."

495
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,999
Good boy.
Not like our booby.

496
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,075
Unfortunately, our boy would never
say such a thing.

497
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,430
I can imagine that family ofyours!

498
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:43,510
They're no worse than we are.
He works for a newspaper.

499
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,153
And thinks he's a writer, too.

500
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,278
Though he's unable to understand

501
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,233
that a book is not a way of making
money but a statement.

502
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,839
A poet is called upon
to provoke a spiritual jolt

503
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,996
and not to cultivate idolaters.

504
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,838
What am I going to do?

505
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,439
You're going to get married.

506
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,998
Do you happen to remember
who was it who saw a bush on fire?

507
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,438
I mean the angel as a bush?

508
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:30,155
I don't remember.
In any case, it was not lgnat.

509
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:33,834
Maybe we should send him
to a cadet school?

510
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:40,671
An angel as a flame coming from
a bush appeared to Prophet Moses.

511
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,233
He led his people out across the sea.

512
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,758
Why has nothing like that
ever appeared to me?

513
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:04,829
With an amazing regularity
I keep seeing one and the same dream.

514
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:11,432
It seems to make me return

515
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,756
to the place, poignantly dear to my
heart,

516
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,235
where my grandfather's house
used to be,

517
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:26,069
in which I was born 40 years ago
right on the dinner table.

518
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,234
Each time I try to enter it, something
prevents me from doing that.

519
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,077
I see this dream again and again.

520
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:47,431
And when I see those walls made of
logs and the dark entrance,

521
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:51,317
even in my dream I become aware
that I'm only dreaming it.

522
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:58,669
And the overwhelming joy is clouded
by anticipation of awakening.

523
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,437
At times something happens
and I stop dreaming

524
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:09,235
ofthe house and the pine trees
of my childhood around it.

525
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,596
Then I get depressed.

526
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:19,429
And I can't wait to see
this dream

527
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,439
in which I'll be a child again

528
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,234
and feel happy again

529
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:33,912
because everything will be still
ahead, everything will be possible...

530
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:22,995
Mommy!

531
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,760
- Mom, they opened up!
- What's the matter with you?

532
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,073
Hello.

533
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:46,675
Hello.

534
01:17:55,960 --> 01:18:00,078
- Are you Nadezhda Petrovna?
- I don't think l...

535
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:03,431
I'm Matvey lvanov's stepdaughter.

536
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:06,756
He was a friend ofyour husband.

537
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:10,598
What Matvey?

538
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,839
The doctor. He used to live here.

539
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:19,750
Then he moved to Yurievets
and became a legal expert.

540
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,519
Are you from town?

541
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,678
We're from Moscow,
but we have a room in Yurievets.

542
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:38,317
We were evacuated last fall.

543
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:44,159
The air raids on Moscow began
and I have two kids.

544
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:47,233
My mother has some old connections
here...

545
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,996
My husband is not here,
he's in town.

546
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:02,600
Stop scratching yourself!

547
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,829
Actually I came to see you.
It's a ladies' little secret.

548
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:16,830
Come on in.
Don't stand there...

549
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,591
Wipe your feet.
Masha's just washed the floor.

550
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:55,750
Sit here for a while.
We won't be long.

551
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:03,239
Why are you sitting in the dark?
Did it go out?

552
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,316
You should've called us.

553
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:12,314
- What's your name?
- Alyosha.

554
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:18,916
I've got a son, too.
Not so big as you, of course.

555
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:22,517
It's not easy having kids now,
with the war going.

556
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,749
I wish I had a girl too.

557
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,920
Want to have a look? He's asleep.

558
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:32,438
We'll be quiet.
He's such a darling.

559
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:19,439
The other day he asked his father:

560
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:23,749
"Why is 5 kopecks bigger
than 10 kopecks?"

561
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:29,229
I was just dumfounded, and
his father didn't know what to say.

562
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:35,589
He always wanted a daughter.
He even thought of a girl's name.

563
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:41,590
And I prepared a pink layette.

564
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,756
Then I had to make everything anew.

565
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:49,598
He put us up to a lot oftrouble,
little rascal.

566
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,675
We woke you up, didn't we?

567
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,509
That's your mommy's fault,
she just can't stop talking.

568
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:03,829
See, we've got company.
Some strangers, aren't they?

569
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:09,228
You just wouldn't wake up,
would you?

570
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:14,238
All right, honey, go back to sleep.

571
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:27,678
Do they become me? And the ring?

572
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:33,077
- What's wrong?
- I just felt queasy.

573
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:37,669
Of course, you've made a long trip.
I should have known better.

574
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:40,839
Have a drink. It will warm you up.

575
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:48,590
I just talk and talk
when I ought to make supper.

576
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,759
Oh please, you don't have to do it.

577
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:57,592
- But I can't let you go like that.
- We had a meal before leaving.

578
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,589
I don't like his cough!

579
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:05,235
Well, he runs wild...

580
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:09,439
We must have my husband
examine him.

581
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:13,998
We can't wait, we have a two-hour
walk to make.

582
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:17,988
And what about the earrings?
My husband's got the money.

583
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:22,432
We're going to have a cock
slaughtered. Only may I ask you...

584
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:26,909
I'm three months pregnant
and having fits of sickness.

585
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,839
Even when I'm milking a cow,
it gets so bad...

586
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:35,076
As for the cock...
Could you?

587
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:38,838
Well, I myself...

588
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:41,834
What, you too?

589
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:46,432
No, but I've never done it before.

590
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:50,918
Oh, it's nothing. Sure, in Moscow
you ate them already slaughtered.

591
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:57,317
I usually do it right here,
on this little log.

592
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:01,237
Here's the axe. My husband
has sharpened it this morning.

593
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:05,077
- You mean, right in the room?
- We'll put a basin under.

594
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:10,070
And tomorrow you'll take
a chicken with you.

595
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,679
No, I can't.

596
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:16,831
Maybe we'll ask Alyosha to do that?
After all, he's a man.

597
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,678
Why Alyosha?

598
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:27,070
All right, hold it tight. If it breaks
loose, it'll smash the dishes.

599
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:42,237
Oh no, I don't feel... Well?

600
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:34,430
Calm down. Everything will be
all right.

601
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:37,438
I wish I could see you

602
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:40,234
not only when I feel too bad.

603
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:44,235
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

604
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,678
At last I soared up.

605
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,519
What's wrong, Marousia?
You feel bad?

606
01:29:55,720 --> 01:30:01,670
Don't be surprised.
I love you.

607
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:07,990
Are you leaving already? And the
earrings? My husband'll be right here.

608
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:11,988
- He's got the money.
- We changed our mind.

609
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:15,829
It's fifteen versts to the town.
It's going to be dark soon.

610
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:17,996
That's all right, don't worry.

611
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:34,235
A man has but one body,
Like a single cell.

612
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:37,512
The soul is sick and tired
Of its too solid shell,

613
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:40,757
With ears, mouth, eyes
The size of a nickel coin

614
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:45,238
And skin all scarred and diced,
Spread over a skeleton.

615
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:48,996
Through cornea it wings
To a heavenly spring,

616
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:52,988
To ice-laden slings,
To a chariot birds bring.

617
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:56,590
It hears through the grating
Of its living prison pen

618
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:01,238
The fields' and forests' rattling,
The Seven Seas' refrain.

619
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:06,078
Without body a soul's nude,
As a body's nude without a shirt:

620
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:10,831
No thought's forthcoming, no good,
No idea's born and no word.

621
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:15,234
A question that has no answer:
Whoever can come back

622
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:19,759
From the floor where no dancer
Was ever to leave track?

623
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:24,512
I dream of another soul,
ln quite a different garb:

624
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:28,316
While shifting between dole
And hope, it burns up,

625
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:32,433
Like alcohol, and goes
Away, casts no shadow

626
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,759
And just leaves as mementoes
The lilacs smelling of meadow.

627
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:41,829
Run on, my child, do not lament
The fate of poor Eurydice,

628
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:46,079
Just keep on driving to globe's end
Your copper hoop for all to see.

629
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:50,319
As long as answering to your step,
However slight might be a tone,

630
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:55,317
The earth sends signals gay and pep
To every energetic bone.

631
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:36,909
Mom, the kerosene stove is smoking.

632
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:39,429
What?

633
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,356
Everything will depend on him.

634
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:02,233
Do you think a sore throat could
have such an after-effect?

635
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:07,676
A sore throat has nothing to do
with it.

636
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:14,439
- This is a common case.
- Common?

637
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:28,436
A mother dies suddenly,
then the man's wife and child...

638
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:33,590
A few days and the man is no more,
though he was quite healthy.

639
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,756
But no one died in his family.

640
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:44,159
There're such things as conscience...
memories...

641
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:46,232
What memories have to do it with it?

642
01:35:55,560 --> 01:36:00,236
- You think he's guilty of something?
- He thinks so.

643
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,232
Leave me alone.

644
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:11,508
- Did you say something?
- Leave me alone!

645
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:17,439
I just wanted to be happy.

646
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:22,075
And what's going to happen to your
mother ifyou don't get up?

647
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:31,838
It's nothing, everything will be
all right...

648
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:35,438
Everything will be...

649
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:51,677
Would you rather have a boy
or a girl?

650
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:50,918
The End
