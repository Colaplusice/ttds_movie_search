1
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:14,498
If we look at the base of a brain
which has just been removed from a skull,

2
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:18,752
there's very little of the midbrain
that we can actually see.

3
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:22,089
Yet, as I demonstrated
in my lecture last week,

4
00:05:22,214 --> 00:05:28,304
if the under aspects of the temporal lobes
are gently pulled apart,

5
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:33,184
the upper portion of the stem
of the brain can be seen.

6
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:38,690
This so-called brainstem
consists of the midbrain,

7
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:44,237
a rounded protrusion called the pons,

8
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:49,450
and a stalk tapering downwards
called the medulla oblongata

9
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:53,329
which passes out of the skull
through the foramen magnum

10
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:56,542
and becomes, of course, the spinal cord.

11
00:05:57,293 --> 00:05:59,962
Are there any questions before we proceed?

12
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:02,381
I have one question, Dr Frankenstein.

13
00:06:05,217 --> 00:06:07,386
That's Fronkonsteen.

14
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:09,471
I beg your pardon?

15
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:13,392
My name. It's pronounced "Fronkonsteen".

16
00:06:13,517 --> 00:06:17,313
But aren't you the grandson
of the famous Dr Victor Frankenstein,

17
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:22,401
who dug up freshly buried corpses
and transformed dead components into...

18
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:24,153
Yes, yes.

19
00:06:24,278 --> 00:06:25,363
Yes.

20
00:06:25,488 --> 00:06:27,532
We all know what he did.

21
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:33,204
But I'd rather be remembered
for my own small contributions to science

22
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:37,667
and not because of my accidental
relationship

23
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:41,087
to a famous... cuckoo.

24
00:06:45,091 --> 00:06:47,761
Now, if you don't mind,
can we have your question?

25
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:51,598
Well, sir, I'm not sure
I understand the distinction between

26
00:06:51,723 --> 00:06:54,392
reflexive and voluntary nerve impulses.

27
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:58,689
Good. Since our lab work today
is a demonstration of just that distinction,

28
00:06:58,814 --> 00:07:01,275
why don't we proceed?

29
00:07:10,618 --> 00:07:13,955
Mr Hilltop here,
with whom I have never worked

30
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,916
or given any prior instructions to,

31
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:20,962
has graciously offered his services
for today's demonstration.

32
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:26,009
Mr Hilltop, would you hop up on your feet
and stand beside this table?

33
00:07:35,852 --> 00:07:37,896
Nice hopping.

34
00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:42,109
Mr Hilltop,

35
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:47,364
would you raise your left knee, please?

36
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:53,745
You have just witnessed
a voluntary nerve impulse.

37
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:56,916
It begins as a stimulus
from the cerebral cortex,

38
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,503
passes through the brainstem
and to the muscles involved.

39
00:08:00,586 --> 00:08:02,880
Mr Hilltop, you may lower your knee.

40
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:08,219
Reflex movements are those
which are made independently of the will,

41
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:10,555
but are carried out along pathways

42
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,143
which pass between the peripheral nervous
system and the central nervous system.

43
00:08:15,268 --> 00:08:18,521
You filthy, rotten, yellow son of a bitch.

44
00:08:18,605 --> 00:08:21,357
We are not aware of these impulses.

45
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:25,361
Neither do we intend them
to carry out our contraction of muscles.

46
00:08:25,487 --> 00:08:27,948
Yet, as you can see, they work by themselves.

47
00:08:28,073 --> 00:08:32,369
But what if we block the nerve impulse
by simply applying local pressure,

48
00:08:32,494 --> 00:08:35,497
which can be done
with any ordinary metal clamp

49
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:40,085
just at the swelling
on the posterior nerve roots

50
00:08:41,462 --> 00:08:45,090
for, say... five or six seconds?

51
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:52,306
Why, you mother-grabbing bastard.

52
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:56,519
As you can see,
all communication is shut off.

53
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:02,817
In spite of our mechanical magnificence,

54
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:08,531
if it were not for this continuous stream
of motor impulses,

55
00:09:08,657 --> 00:09:10,700
we would collapse

56
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:14,162
like a bunch of broccoli.

57
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:21,878
In conclusion, it should be noted...

58
00:09:22,504 --> 00:09:25,423
- Give him an extra dollar.
- Extra dollar. Yes, sir.

59
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:28,469
...that any more than common injury

60
00:09:28,552 --> 00:09:31,305
to the nerve root is always serious.

61
00:09:32,014 --> 00:09:35,267
Because once a nerve fibre is severed,

62
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:38,854
there is no way, in heaven or on earth,

63
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:42,692
to regenerate life back into it.

64
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:45,736
Are there any last questions before we leave?

65
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:47,822
Dr Frank...

66
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:50,324
- Fronkonsteen...
- Yes?

67
00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:54,829
Isn't it true that Darwin preserved
a piece of vermicelli in a glass case

68
00:09:54,912 --> 00:09:57,165
until, by some extraordinary means,

69
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:00,877
it actually began to move
with a voluntary motion?

70
00:10:01,586 --> 00:10:05,340
Are you speaking of the worm
or the spaghetti?

71
00:10:06,758 --> 00:10:08,802
Why, the worm, sir.

72
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:13,473
Yes. It seems to me I did read something
of that incident when I was a student.

73
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:17,185
But you have to remember that a worm,
with very few exceptions,

74
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:20,314
is not a human being.

75
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:24,359
But wasn't that the basis
of your grandfather's work, sir?

76
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:26,529
The reanimation of dead tissue?

77
00:10:26,654 --> 00:10:30,241
My grandfather was a very sick man.

78
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:34,579
But as a Fronkonsteen,
aren't you the least bit curious about it?

79
00:10:34,704 --> 00:10:39,083
Doesn't bringing back to life what was
once dead hold any intrigue for you?

80
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:45,798
You are talking about the nonsensical ravings
of a lunatic mind. Dead is dead.

81
00:10:45,923 --> 00:10:48,760
But look at what has been done
with hearts and kidneys.

82
00:10:48,843 --> 00:10:54,349
Hearts and kidneys are Tinkertoys.
I'm talking about the central nervous system.

83
00:10:54,474 --> 00:10:57,811
- But, sir...
- I am a scientist, not a philosopher!

84
00:10:57,895 --> 00:11:00,731
You have more chance
of reanimating this scalpel

85
00:11:00,814 --> 00:11:03,067
than of mending a broken nervous system.

86
00:11:03,192 --> 00:11:08,113
- But what about your grandfather's work?
- My grandfather's work was doo-doo!

87
00:11:10,032 --> 00:11:12,117
I am not interested in death.

88
00:11:12,242 --> 00:11:15,955
The only thing that concerns me
is the preservation of life!

89
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:25,798
Class...

90
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:27,634
...is...

91
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:29,761
...dismissed.

92
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:40,772
Dr Frankenstein...

93
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:44,401
That's Fronkonsteen.

94
00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:50,365
My name is Gerhart Falkstein.

95
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:55,912
I have travelled 5,000 miles to bring you
the will of your great-grandfather.

96
00:11:55,996 --> 00:12:00,710
Baron Beaufort von Frankenstein.

97
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,684
Oh, my sweet darling.

98
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:20,855
Oh, my dearest love.
I'll count the hours that you're away.

99
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:24,859
- Oh, darling, so will I.
- Not on the lips.

100
00:12:24,984 --> 00:12:29,364
I'm going to that party at Nanna and Nicky's.
I don't wanna smear my lipstick.

101
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:31,199
- You understand.
- Of course.

102
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,826
All aboard!

103
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:36,496
- Oh, dear.
- Well, I guess this is it.

104
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,582
Freddy, darling.

105
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:43,003
Oh, how can I say in a few minutes
what it's taken me a lifetime to understand?

106
00:12:43,086 --> 00:12:45,130
- Won't you try?
- All right.

107
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:48,133
You've got it, mister.

108
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:52,220
I'm yours. All of me. What else can I say?

109
00:12:52,346 --> 00:12:55,515
- My sweet love...
- The hair. Just been set.

110
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:57,602
Sorry.

111
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:02,857
- I hope you like old-fashioned weddings.
- I prefer old-fashioned wedding nights.

112
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,611
- You're incorrigible.
- Does that mean...

113
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:11,741
...you love me?
- You bet your boots it does.

114
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,453
- Oh, my only love.
- Taffeta, darling.

115
00:13:15,912 --> 00:13:17,872
Taffeta, sweetheart.

116
00:13:17,956 --> 00:13:22,502
No, the dress is taffeta. It wrinkles so easily.

117
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:24,087
All aboard!

118
00:13:24,212 --> 00:13:26,422
There's that horrid man again.

119
00:13:26,547 --> 00:13:29,468
Well, hurry now,
before I make a fool of myself.

120
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:31,595
Oh, my nails!

121
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,764
Sorry.

122
00:13:41,271 --> 00:13:43,774
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Freddy.

123
00:13:49,446 --> 00:13:50,906
Darling.

124
00:14:14,264 --> 00:14:17,726
- Harry, he was at it again.
- So what do you want me to do about it?

125
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:19,311
Every day.

126
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:21,187
Let him. Let him.

127
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:25,108
New York next. Everybody out for New York.

128
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:55,264
Pardon me, boy.
Is this the Transylvania Station?

129
00:14:56,432 --> 00:14:58,644
<i>Ja, ja. Track 29.</i>

130
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:02,230
Oh, can I give you a shine?

131
00:15:03,774 --> 00:15:05,817
No, thanks.

132
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:35,223
Dr Frankenstein?

133
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,980
Fronkonsteen.

134
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,984
You're putting me on.

135
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:48,403
No. It's pronounced Fronkonsteen.

136
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:51,739
Do you also say Frodorick?

137
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:53,908
No. Frederick.

138
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:57,203
Well, why isn't it Frodorick Fronkonsteen?

139
00:15:57,328 --> 00:15:59,915
It isn't. It's Frederick Fronkonsteen.

140
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,293
I see.

141
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:05,921
- You must be lgor.
- No. It's pronounced I-gor.

142
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:11,635
- But they told me it was lgor.
- Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?

143
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:15,139
<i>You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?</i>

144
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:19,226
Yes. My grandfather
used to work for your grandfather.

145
00:16:22,187 --> 00:16:25,274
- How nice.
- Of course, the rates have gone up.

146
00:16:25,357 --> 00:16:29,070
Of course. I'm sure we'll get along splendidly.

147
00:16:30,613 --> 00:16:33,283
Sorry. I...

148
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:38,246
You know, I don't mean to embarrass you,
but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.

149
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,832
Perhaps I could help you with that hump.

150
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:43,001
What hump?

151
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,591
Let's go.

152
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:52,844
Allow me, master.

153
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:55,013
Thanks very much.

154
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,354
Walk this way.

155
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,232
This way.

156
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:26,128
I think you'll be more comfortable in the rear.

157
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,846
- What was that?
- That'll be Inga.

158
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:39,267
<i>Herr Falkstein thought you might need
a laboratory assistant temporarily.</i>

159
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:47,192
Hello.
Would you like to have a roll in the hay?

160
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,237
It's fun.

161
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:53,865
Roll, roll, roll in the hay

162
00:18:16,931 --> 00:18:19,434
Sometimes I am afraid of the lightning.

163
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,936
It's just an atmospheric discharge.

164
00:18:22,061 --> 00:18:24,105
Nothing to be afraid of.

165
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:31,572
Werewolf.

166
00:18:31,697 --> 00:18:33,741
Werewolf?

167
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:35,909
- There.
- What?

168
00:18:36,785 --> 00:18:38,829
There wolf.

169
00:18:38,954 --> 00:18:40,998
There castle.

170
00:18:41,123 --> 00:18:43,167
Why are you talking that way?

171
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:46,211
- I thought you wanted to.
- No, I don't want to.

172
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:49,214
Suit yourself. I'm easy.

173
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:54,053
Well...

174
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:55,929
There it is.

175
00:18:56,013 --> 00:18:58,057
Home.

176
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:32,718
What knockers.

177
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:35,846
Thank you, Doctor.

178
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:38,432
Oh, that's all right.

179
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:41,227
There we are.

180
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:56,659
<i>I am Frau Blcher.</i>

181
00:20:00,956 --> 00:20:03,000
Steady!

182
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:07,254
How do you do? I am Dr Fronkonsteen.

183
00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:11,008
<i>This is my assistant.
Inga, may I present Frau Blcher?</i>

184
00:20:14,636 --> 00:20:17,389
I wonder what's got into them.

185
00:20:17,472 --> 00:20:22,102
<i>Your rooms have been prepared, Herr Doktor.</i>

186
00:20:22,227 --> 00:20:24,896
If you will follow me.

187
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,066
I-gor. Would you bring the bags
as soon as you're finished, please?

188
00:20:28,191 --> 00:20:29,652
Yes, master.

189
00:20:29,777 --> 00:20:32,238
<i>After you, Frau Blcher.</i>

190
00:20:47,211 --> 00:20:49,422
Blcher!

191
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:08,734
Follow me, please.

192
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:31,841
Stay close to the candles.

193
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:35,553
The staircase can be treacherous.

194
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:48,650
<i>Und this is your room.
It was your grandfather Victor's room.</i>

195
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:50,819
I see.

196
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,197
Well. Seem to be quite a few books.

197
00:21:54,364 --> 00:21:56,408
This was Victor's...

198
00:21:57,033 --> 00:22:00,037
...the Baron's medical library.

199
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:04,333
- Where is my grandfather's private library?
- I don't know what you mean, sir.

200
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:08,587
Well, these books are very general.
Any doctor might have them in his study.

201
00:22:08,713 --> 00:22:12,842
This is the only library I know of,
Dr Frankenstone.

202
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,178
- Fronkonsteen.
- Fronkonsteen.

203
00:22:16,971 --> 00:22:19,432
Well, we'll see.

204
00:22:20,349 --> 00:22:22,393
Good night.

205
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:28,232
Would the doctor care for
a brandy before retiring?

206
00:22:29,192 --> 00:22:31,862
No. Thank you.

207
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:36,074
Some warm milk...

208
00:22:37,117 --> 00:22:38,994
...perhaps?

209
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:42,581
No, thank you very much.

210
00:22:42,706 --> 00:22:44,833
No, thanks.

211
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,960
Ovaltine?

212
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,133
Nothing.

213
00:22:53,258 --> 00:22:55,052
Thank you.

214
00:22:55,177 --> 00:22:57,554
I'm a little tired.

215
00:23:00,475 --> 00:23:02,602
Then I will say... good night.

216
00:23:02,727 --> 00:23:04,771
Good night!

217
00:23:20,995 --> 00:23:23,915
Good night, darling.

218
00:23:27,377 --> 00:23:29,505
<i>Good night, Herr Doktor.</i>

219
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,007
<i>Good night, Frau Blcher.</i>

220
00:23:53,612 --> 00:23:55,656
No, no, no...

221
00:23:57,157 --> 00:23:59,619
No, no, no...

222
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,418
I'm not a Frankenstein.

223
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:09,921
I am not a Frankenstein.

224
00:24:11,381 --> 00:24:13,425
I'm a Fronkonsteen.

225
00:24:14,217 --> 00:24:16,261
Don't gimme that!

226
00:24:16,386 --> 00:24:19,139
I don't believe in fate.

227
00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:21,933
And I won't say it.

228
00:24:23,351 --> 00:24:25,895
All right, you win. I give.

229
00:24:26,062 --> 00:24:28,606
I'll say it. I'll say it, I'll say it.

230
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:32,862
Destiny. Destiny.

231
00:24:33,446 --> 00:24:35,823
No escaping that for me.

232
00:24:35,948 --> 00:24:38,075
Destiny. Destiny.

233
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,536
No escaping that for me.

234
00:24:40,661 --> 00:24:42,872
Destiny. Destiny...

235
00:24:42,955 --> 00:24:44,999
No escaping...

236
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:49,295
Dr Fronkonsteen. Wake up.

237
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:53,841
- What is it?
- You were having a nightmare.

238
00:24:55,843 --> 00:24:58,846
- What's that strange music?
- I have no idea.

239
00:25:00,182 --> 00:25:02,225
But it seems to be coming

240
00:25:03,393 --> 00:25:05,812
from behind the bookcase.

241
00:25:07,397 --> 00:25:09,983
Behind the bookcase...

242
00:25:11,652 --> 00:25:13,862
Hand me that robe, would you, dear?

243
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,953
You were right.
It's coming from behind this wall.

244
00:25:22,871 --> 00:25:24,331
Where is it?

245
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,416
- Where is it?
- What?

246
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,630
There's always a device.
If I can just spot the triggering mechanism...

247
00:25:30,713 --> 00:25:32,757
Hello.

248
00:25:43,184 --> 00:25:47,313
It seems louder over here.
Hand me that candle, will you?

249
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:54,988
Put the candle back.

250
00:26:01,203 --> 00:26:05,332
All right. I think I have it figured out now.

251
00:26:05,416 --> 00:26:10,838
Take out the candle
and I'll block the bookcase with my body.

252
00:26:21,265 --> 00:26:24,018
Listen to me very carefully.

253
00:26:24,101 --> 00:26:27,354
Don't put the candle back.

254
00:26:27,938 --> 00:26:29,898
With all of your might,

255
00:26:30,024 --> 00:26:33,820
shove against the other side
of the bookcase.

256
00:26:34,321 --> 00:26:36,906
Is that perfectly clear?

257
00:26:38,158 --> 00:26:40,201
I think so.

258
00:26:48,752 --> 00:26:50,795
Good girl.

259
00:26:51,921 --> 00:26:55,008
Put the candle back.

260
00:27:02,391 --> 00:27:04,894
Oh, look, Doctor. A passageway.

261
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:08,105
Whatever that music is,
it's coming from down there.

262
00:27:08,189 --> 00:27:11,817
- I'd better take a look.
- Oh, let me come with you, Doctor, please.

263
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:13,986
I don't wanna stay up here alone.

264
00:27:14,111 --> 00:27:17,114
All right, then.
Close your robe and follow me.

265
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:19,283
Oh, Doctor. The candle...

266
00:27:20,117 --> 00:27:22,787
Good thinking. Let's try this one.

267
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,123
Stand back!

268
00:27:59,449 --> 00:28:01,911
Don't be frightened, dear. Just a rat.

269
00:28:02,704 --> 00:28:05,123
A filthy, slimy rat.

270
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,203
Good Lord!

271
00:29:02,766 --> 00:29:04,476
I-I-I-I-I-I

272
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,936
Ain't got nobody

273
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:10,482
And nobody cares for me

274
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:13,485
- I-gor.
- Frodorick.

275
00:29:13,568 --> 00:29:15,612
How did you get here?

276
00:29:17,238 --> 00:29:21,201
Through the dumbwaiter. I heard
strange music from the upstairs kitchen

277
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,620
and I just followed it down.

278
00:29:23,745 --> 00:29:26,831
Call it... a hunch.

279
00:29:27,374 --> 00:29:31,504
- There must have been someone else here.
- It would seem that way.

280
00:29:31,587 --> 00:29:34,423
And there's the only other door.

281
00:29:34,548 --> 00:29:36,592
Wait, master.

282
00:29:36,717 --> 00:29:38,761
It might be dangerous.

283
00:29:39,637 --> 00:29:41,681
You go first.

284
00:29:53,067 --> 00:29:55,528
Aren't there any lights in this place?

285
00:29:56,612 --> 00:30:01,243
Two nasty-looking switches over here,
but I'm not going to be the first.

286
00:30:06,415 --> 00:30:08,458
Damn your eyes.

287
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:10,627
Too late.

288
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:26,560
So this is where it all happened.

289
00:30:37,697 --> 00:30:42,493
<i>Just think. A dead brain
ready to live again in a new body.</i>

290
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:46,122
<i>Look. No blood, no decomposition.</i>

291
00:30:46,205 --> 00:30:48,249
<i>Just a few sutures.</i>

292
00:30:48,374 --> 00:30:51,044
<i>- Throw the main switch.
- Yes, master.</i>

293
00:30:57,884 --> 00:31:00,219
What a filthy mess.

294
00:31:00,345 --> 00:31:04,141
I dunno. A little paint, a few flowers,
couple of throw pillows...

295
00:31:08,228 --> 00:31:12,941
Well, it seems as if our mysterious violinist
has disa... p...

296
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:15,819
- Disa... what?
...peared.

297
00:31:15,944 --> 00:31:19,657
There is a light
coming from behind that door.

298
00:31:22,076 --> 00:31:24,119
Follow me.

299
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,984
Doctor, look!

300
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,489
Well... This explains the music.

301
00:32:01,074 --> 00:32:03,035
It's still warm.

302
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,121
But who was playing it?

303
00:32:05,246 --> 00:32:06,789
I don't know.

304
00:32:06,914 --> 00:32:10,710
But whoever it was just barely finished
putting out his cigar.

305
00:32:10,835 --> 00:32:13,504
Such strange goings-on.

306
00:32:15,965 --> 00:32:18,009
What is this place?

307
00:32:18,134 --> 00:32:20,594
Music room?

308
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,723
But there's nothing here
but books and papers.

309
00:32:24,265 --> 00:32:26,309
Books and papers?

310
00:32:27,184 --> 00:32:28,644
It is!

311
00:32:28,728 --> 00:32:32,107
This is my grandfather's private library.
I feel it.

312
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:35,610
Look! Look at this.

313
00:32:50,042 --> 00:32:55,047
"...until, from the midst of this
darkness, a sudden light broke in upon me."

314
00:32:56,089 --> 00:33:00,552
"A light so brilliant and wondrous,
and yet so simple."

315
00:33:01,678 --> 00:33:04,182
"Change the poles from plus to minus

316
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:08,186
and from minus to plus."

317
00:33:11,939 --> 00:33:16,235
"I alone succeeded in discovering
the secret of bestowing life."

318
00:33:16,903 --> 00:33:18,780
"Nay, even more..."

319
00:33:18,905 --> 00:33:24,160
"I myself became capable
of bestowing animation

320
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:27,413
upon lifeless matter."

321
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:37,883
It could work.

322
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:58,153
- Kipper?
- Thank you, Doctor.

323
00:34:03,827 --> 00:34:07,163
"As the minuteness of the parts
formed a hindrance to my speed,

324
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:12,919
I resolved therefore
to make the creature of a gigantic stature."

325
00:34:15,547 --> 00:34:17,257
Of course.

326
00:34:17,382 --> 00:34:19,509
That would simplify everything.

327
00:34:19,634 --> 00:34:21,261
In other words,

328
00:34:21,344 --> 00:34:26,224
his veins, his feet, his hands, his organs
would all have to be increased in size.

329
00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:28,268
Exactly.

330
00:34:29,144 --> 00:34:31,896
<i>He would have an enormous Schwanzstck.</i>

331
00:34:37,862 --> 00:34:40,072
That goes without saying.

332
00:34:40,197 --> 00:34:41,657
Woof.

333
00:34:42,658 --> 00:34:45,161
He's gonna be very popular.

334
00:34:46,037 --> 00:34:51,542
So then. What we're aiming for is a being
approximately seven feet in height,

335
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:56,589
with all features either congenitally
or artificially proportionate in size.

336
00:34:56,714 --> 00:34:58,591
Something like...

337
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,177
...this?

338
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,184
Hello...

339
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:09,353
You've caught something there.

340
00:35:09,478 --> 00:35:13,065
Crude, yes, primitive, yes,
perhaps even grotesque,

341
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,942
yet something inexplicable tells me

342
00:35:16,818 --> 00:35:21,114
that this might be our man.

343
00:35:37,256 --> 00:35:39,300
All right, all right.

344
00:35:39,425 --> 00:35:41,928
That's good enough for the likes of 'im.

345
00:35:58,987 --> 00:36:01,030
Get down, you fool.

346
00:36:09,456 --> 00:36:11,500
Now.

347
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,574
What a filthy job.

348
00:36:43,074 --> 00:36:45,368
- Could be worse.
- How?

349
00:36:45,493 --> 00:36:47,537
Could be raining.

350
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,005
Quick.

351
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:43,345
Need a hand?

352
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:47,015
No, thanks. I have one.
Thanks very much all the same.

353
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,850
Just a moment, sir.

354
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:52,771
I know everyone around here,
but I've never seen your face before.

355
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,940
Can you account for yourself?

356
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:59,194
Yes. I am Dr Frederick Fronkonsteen,
newly arrived from America.

357
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:01,989
Oh, yes, sir. I was told you were here.

358
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:05,368
Well, I'm Constable Henry, sir.
Pleased to meet you.

359
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,497
How very nice to meet you, Constable.

360
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:12,625
Why, you're chilled to the bone, sir.

361
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,753
A nice, warm fire would be the thing for you.

362
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:19,298
A little nip from the old bottle
wouldn't be too bad either, sir.

363
00:38:19,382 --> 00:38:21,634
That's the ticket, yes.

364
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:25,304
Well, if you have everything in hand, sir,
I'll say good night.

365
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,473
Thank you very much, Constable.

366
00:38:27,598 --> 00:38:30,601
At your service, sir, always.

367
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,274
- Good night, Constable.
- Good night, sir.

368
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:55,544
Oh, what an awesome sight.

369
00:38:56,962 --> 00:39:00,674
What a profound and reverend night is this.

370
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:04,346
With such a specimen for a body,

371
00:39:04,971 --> 00:39:09,351
all we need now is
an equally magnificent brain.

372
00:39:11,353 --> 00:39:14,272
- You know what to do?
- I have a pretty good idea.

373
00:39:14,397 --> 00:39:16,441
Good man.

374
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:20,487
Didn't you... Didn't you use to have that
on the other side?

375
00:39:20,612 --> 00:39:22,656
- What?
- Your...

376
00:39:23,615 --> 00:39:25,659
Never mind.

377
00:39:29,371 --> 00:39:32,999
- Do you have that name I gave you?
- I have it written down.

378
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:38,589
- H Delbruck.
- Hans Delbruck.

379
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:35,043
- He is hideous.
- He's beautiful.

380
00:41:36,211 --> 00:41:39,673
And he is mine.

381
00:41:47,681 --> 00:41:50,517
Hurry now.
We're fighting time and the elements.

382
00:41:50,642 --> 00:41:54,688
- Are you ready?
- Are you sure this is how they did it?

383
00:41:54,813 --> 00:41:57,399
Yes. It's all written down in the notes.

384
00:41:57,524 --> 00:42:00,610
Now tie off the kites
and hurry down as fast as you can.

385
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:02,195
What's the hurry?

386
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,242
There's a possibility of electrocution.
Do you understand?

387
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,958
I say: "There's a possibility of electrocution."

388
00:42:14,542 --> 00:42:16,961
Do you understand?

389
00:42:17,086 --> 00:42:20,089
I understand, I understand.
Why are you shouting?

390
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:22,925
Did you...

391
00:42:23,926 --> 00:42:26,846
- Did you tie off the kites?
- Of course.

392
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,224
All right. Good.

393
00:42:32,518 --> 00:42:35,355
- Check the generator.
- Yes, master.

394
00:42:43,113 --> 00:42:44,364
I-gor,

395
00:42:44,489 --> 00:42:47,909
- release the safety valve on the main wheel.
- Yes, master.

396
00:42:53,999 --> 00:42:58,545
Can you imagine the brain
of Hans Delbruck in this body?

397
00:42:58,628 --> 00:43:00,589
Oh, Frederick.

398
00:43:01,131 --> 00:43:03,175
This is the moment.

399
00:43:04,176 --> 00:43:06,220
Well, dear...

400
00:43:06,346 --> 00:43:08,389
Are you ready?

401
00:43:08,514 --> 00:43:10,558
Yes, Doctor.

402
00:43:12,018 --> 00:43:14,062
Elevate me.

403
00:43:14,812 --> 00:43:16,856
Now? Right here?

404
00:43:18,691 --> 00:43:22,487
- Yes, yes. Raise the platform.
- Oh, the platform.

405
00:43:22,612 --> 00:43:24,864
<i>Oh, that. Ja... yes.</i>

406
00:43:44,051 --> 00:43:48,597
From that fateful day
when stinking bits of slime

407
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:53,394
first crawled from the sea
and shouted to the cold stars:

408
00:43:54,019 --> 00:43:56,689
"I am man",

409
00:43:58,023 --> 00:44:02,736
our greatest dread has always been
the knowledge of our own mortality.

410
00:44:03,529 --> 00:44:05,573
But tonight

411
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:08,451
we shall hurl the gauntlet of science

412
00:44:08,576 --> 00:44:12,163
into the frightful face of death itself.

413
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:16,584
Tonight,

414
00:44:16,835 --> 00:44:20,755
we shall ascend into the heavens.

415
00:44:21,381 --> 00:44:24,300
We shall mock the earthquake.

416
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:27,554
We shall command the thunders

417
00:44:28,388 --> 00:44:30,432
and penetrate

418
00:44:30,557 --> 00:44:37,189
into the very womb
of impervious nature herself.

419
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:49,243
When I give the word,
throw the first switch.

420
00:44:49,785 --> 00:44:51,829
You've got it, master.

421
00:44:55,958 --> 00:44:58,002
Get ready.

422
00:45:00,921 --> 00:45:02,882
Get set.

423
00:45:02,965 --> 00:45:04,759
Go!

424
00:45:10,766 --> 00:45:13,018
Throw the second switch.

425
00:45:17,606 --> 00:45:20,192
Throw the third switch.

426
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:22,736
Not the third switch?

427
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:25,947
Throw it, I say. Throw it!

428
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,004
Life.

429
00:45:40,129 --> 00:45:42,715
Life, do you hear me?

430
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,884
Give my creation

431
00:45:45,635 --> 00:45:48,096
life!

432
00:46:10,244 --> 00:46:12,746
Turn everything off and bring me down.

433
00:47:22,818 --> 00:47:24,862
Nothing.

434
00:47:25,321 --> 00:47:27,823
- Oh, Doctor. I'm sorry...
- No, no.

435
00:47:28,657 --> 00:47:31,494
Be of good cheer.

436
00:47:31,577 --> 00:47:34,497
If science teaches us anything,

437
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:38,126
it teaches us to accept our failures

438
00:47:38,251 --> 00:47:40,754
as well as our successes

439
00:47:41,463 --> 00:47:44,883
with quiet dignity

440
00:47:46,385 --> 00:47:48,679
and grace.

441
00:47:58,897 --> 00:48:01,441
Son of a bitch, bastard. I'll get you for this.

442
00:48:01,566 --> 00:48:03,610
What did you do to me?

443
00:48:03,735 --> 00:48:07,448
- What did you do to me?
- Doctor, stop it!

444
00:48:07,573 --> 00:48:09,450
You'll kill him!

445
00:48:10,868 --> 00:48:12,495
I don't wanna live.

446
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,957
I do not want to live.

447
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:20,920
Quiet dignity and grace.

448
00:48:21,921 --> 00:48:24,007
Mama!

449
00:48:25,466 --> 00:48:29,137
Oh, tosh! This man is different, I tell you.

450
00:48:29,262 --> 00:48:33,016
You can see that after you've
talked to him for five minutes.

451
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:36,687
Yes?

452
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:40,274
He's a Frankenstein!

453
00:48:40,399 --> 00:48:43,652
And they're all alike.

454
00:48:44,361 --> 00:48:46,864
It's in their blood. They can't 'elp it.

455
00:48:47,406 --> 00:48:50,075
All those scientists, they're all alike.

456
00:48:50,826 --> 00:48:52,870
They say they're working for us.

457
00:48:53,203 --> 00:48:57,249
What they really want is to rule the world.

458
00:49:03,797 --> 00:49:08,178
That's enough now. I will not have
this meeting become a free-for-all.

459
00:49:08,261 --> 00:49:11,097
These are very serious charges
you're making,

460
00:49:11,222 --> 00:49:16,269
and all the more painful to us, your elders,
because we still have nightmares

461
00:49:16,394 --> 00:49:19,064
from five times before.

462
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:26,029
Now, we haven't heard from the one man
most qualified to judge the situation fairly.

463
00:49:27,655 --> 00:49:29,699
Inspector Kemp.

464
00:49:30,825 --> 00:49:33,203
Will you talk to us, please?

465
00:50:00,981 --> 00:50:04,568
A riot is an ugly thing

466
00:50:04,694 --> 00:50:09,074
<i>und once you get one started</i>

467
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:12,285
there is little chance of stopping it

468
00:50:13,078 --> 00:50:15,539
short of bloodshed.

469
00:50:16,498 --> 00:50:21,712
I think before we go around killing people,

470
00:50:21,878 --> 00:50:27,467
we had better make damn sure
of our evidence.

471
00:50:28,969 --> 00:50:31,013
<i>Und...</i>

472
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:38,771
...we had better confirm the fact

473
00:50:38,896 --> 00:50:42,942
that young Frankenstein is indeed

474
00:50:43,026 --> 00:50:46,195
vollowing in his grandfather's vootstaps.

475
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,447
What?

476
00:50:47,572 --> 00:50:50,575
Vollowing in his grandfather's vootstaps.
Vootstaps.

477
00:50:50,658 --> 00:50:52,118
Oh, footsteps.

478
00:50:52,243 --> 00:50:54,287
I think

479
00:50:54,412 --> 00:50:56,706
what is in order

480
00:50:58,624 --> 00:51:03,588
is for me to pay a little visit
on the good doctor

481
00:51:04,213 --> 00:51:09,970
<i>und to have a nice, quiet chat.</i>

Oh, Doctor. You mustn't do this to yourself.

485
00:51:24,651 --> 00:51:27,029
You've got to stop thinking about it.

486
00:51:27,696 --> 00:51:30,699
Why, look.
You haven't even touched your food.

487
00:51:32,785 --> 00:51:34,161
There.

488
00:51:35,496 --> 00:51:37,916
Now I've touched it. Happy?

489
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:42,754
You know... I'll never forget my old dad.

490
00:51:43,755 --> 00:51:48,635
When these things would happen to him...
the things he'd say to me.

491
00:51:50,178 --> 00:51:52,222
What did he say?

492
00:51:52,305 --> 00:51:55,392
What the hell are you doin'
in the bathroom day and night?

493
00:51:55,475 --> 00:51:59,062
Why don't you get outta there
and give someone else a chance?

494
00:52:05,443 --> 00:52:08,531
Oh, maybe it's better this way.

495
00:52:08,656 --> 00:52:11,158
The poor lifeless hulk.

496
00:52:11,283 --> 00:52:14,286
Maybe it is better off dead.

497
00:52:33,347 --> 00:52:35,141
What is this?

498
00:52:35,224 --> 00:52:37,269
<i>Schwarzwlder Kirschtorte.</i>

499
00:52:39,771 --> 00:52:44,568
Do you like it? I'm not partial to
desserts myself, but this is excellent.

500
00:52:44,693 --> 00:52:47,154
Who are you talking to?

501
00:52:47,571 --> 00:52:51,950
To you. You just made a yummy sound,
so I thought you liked the dessert.

502
00:52:52,075 --> 00:52:55,245
I didn't make a yummy sound.
I just asked you what it is.

503
00:52:55,328 --> 00:52:58,582
- But you did. I just heard it.
- It wasn't me.

504
00:52:58,665 --> 00:53:00,709
It wasn't me.

505
00:53:00,834 --> 00:53:04,546
Well, now, look here.
If it wasn't you and it wasn't you...

506
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:30,406
Alive. It's alive.

507
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:33,868
It's alive!

508
00:53:36,496 --> 00:53:38,791
Stand back.

509
00:53:46,215 --> 00:53:48,884
Hello, there.

510
00:53:48,967 --> 00:53:52,054
I'm going to set you free.

511
00:53:54,348 --> 00:53:57,017
- Is the sedative ready?
- Yes, Doctor.

512
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:13,493
I want you

513
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:17,205
to sit up.

514
00:54:31,511 --> 00:54:35,432
Stand on your feet.

515
00:54:39,812 --> 00:54:42,106
You can do it.

516
00:54:51,657 --> 00:54:54,660
Now walk.

517
00:55:01,792 --> 00:55:04,128
Doctor, I'm frightened.

518
00:55:04,253 --> 00:55:06,380
Don't worry.

519
00:55:09,051 --> 00:55:11,094
Good.

520
00:55:12,971 --> 00:55:15,015
Good.

521
00:55:16,641 --> 00:55:18,977
What is it? What's the matter?

522
00:55:19,102 --> 00:55:21,688
Quick. Give him the...

523
00:55:21,813 --> 00:55:23,190
Quick. Give him the...

524
00:55:23,315 --> 00:55:25,567
What? Give him the what?

525
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:29,821
Three syllables.
First syllable - sounds like...

526
00:55:29,946 --> 00:55:32,282
Head. Sounds like head.

527
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:34,743
Bed... Said...

528
00:55:35,202 --> 00:55:36,661
Said.

529
00:55:36,787 --> 00:55:38,247
- Said.
- Said.

530
00:55:38,373 --> 00:55:40,375
Second syllable - little word.

531
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,126
This, that, the...

532
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:43,961
A...

533
00:55:44,504 --> 00:55:46,547
- Said a...
- Said a...

534
00:55:47,131 --> 00:55:49,175
Dirty word. He said a dirty word.

535
00:55:49,967 --> 00:55:52,011
Sounds like...

536
00:55:52,136 --> 00:55:54,180
To give. Give.

537
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:57,266
Said... Said a give... Give him a said a give.

538
00:55:58,059 --> 00:56:00,895
Oh, tive... tive... Sedative.

539
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,064
On the nosey.

540
00:56:22,835 --> 00:56:24,878
Said a give?

541
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:35,639
Oh, Frederick. Are you all right?

542
00:56:35,764 --> 00:56:37,933
Yes.

543
00:56:38,685 --> 00:56:42,647
- Would you excuse me for one minute, dear?
- Of course, Doctor.

544
00:56:43,231 --> 00:56:45,275
I-gor...

545
00:56:46,234 --> 00:56:49,070
- May I speak to you for a moment?
- Of course.

546
00:56:49,195 --> 00:56:51,322
- Sit down, won't you?
- Thank you.

547
00:56:54,701 --> 00:56:56,578
No, no. Up here.

548
00:56:57,162 --> 00:56:59,039
Thank you.

549
00:57:03,251 --> 00:57:06,337
Now, that brain that you gave me...

550
00:57:07,213 --> 00:57:09,967
Was it Hans Delbruck's?

551
00:57:11,969 --> 00:57:14,472
- No.
- Good.

552
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,142
Would you mind telling me...

553
00:57:20,144 --> 00:57:24,273
...whose brain I did put in?

554
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:29,153
- Then you won't be angry?
- I will not be angry.

555
00:57:29,945 --> 00:57:31,989
Abby someone.

556
00:57:32,656 --> 00:57:34,867
Abby someone...

557
00:57:34,992 --> 00:57:37,661
- Abby who?
- Abby Normal.

558
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:42,626
Abby Normal...

559
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:45,212
I'm almost sure that was the name.

560
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:53,929
Are you saying that I put an abnormal brain

561
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,308
into a seven-and-a-half-foot long,

562
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:02,604
54-inch wide

563
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,525
gorilla?

564
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,904
Is that what you're telling me?

565
00:58:10,363 --> 00:58:12,323
Quick, quick. Give him the...

566
00:58:12,448 --> 00:58:14,325
What?

567
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:16,494
Three syllables, yes.

568
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:19,997
I wonder who that could be at this hour.

569
00:58:26,462 --> 00:58:29,799
Inga, quick. See who that is.

570
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:34,804
You... put that thing
back on the operating table.

571
00:58:35,847 --> 00:58:39,184
And strap him down tightly.

572
00:58:40,561 --> 00:58:43,647
- Where are you going?
- To wash up. I've got to look normal.

573
00:58:43,772 --> 00:58:46,108
We've all of us got to behave normally.

574
00:58:49,278 --> 00:58:50,988
Monsters!

575
00:58:56,035 --> 00:58:57,995
Excellent shot.

576
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:02,750
This is the 20th century, Kemp.
Monsters are pass like ghosts and goblins.

577
00:59:02,833 --> 00:59:07,129
<i>Not to the good people
of this village, Herr Doktor.</i>

578
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:10,300
To them

579
00:59:10,383 --> 00:59:13,386
he is a very real thing.

580
00:59:14,304 --> 00:59:19,976
Especially when...
there is a Frankenstein residing in this house.

581
00:59:34,866 --> 00:59:36,951
Nice grouping.

582
00:59:37,077 --> 00:59:39,121
Thank you.

583
00:59:41,582 --> 00:59:47,505
I wouldn't think an intelligent fellow like you
would fall for all this superstitious rot.

584
00:59:48,464 --> 00:59:53,219
<i>It is not superstition that worries me,
Herr Doktor, but genes und</i>

585
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:55,388
chromosomes.

586
00:59:56,305 --> 00:59:59,558
- Rubbish.
- Well, you might say, but this is

587
01:00:00,101 --> 01:00:01,644
Transylvania.

588
01:00:03,896 --> 01:00:05,856
<i>Und you are a</i>

589
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,316
Frankenstein.

590
01:00:10,237 --> 01:00:15,450
You... seem unusually upset
by this discussion.

591
01:00:15,575 --> 01:00:17,619
Not in the least.

592
01:00:18,453 --> 01:00:20,664
I find it extremely amusing, that's all.

593
01:00:23,542 --> 01:00:25,335
Well, this was fun.

594
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:28,296
Now, if you don't mind, Inspector,
I'm a little tired.

595
01:00:28,422 --> 01:00:29,589
Then

596
01:00:29,715 --> 01:00:33,093
I may give the villagers
your complete assurance

597
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:39,434
that you have no interest whatsoever
in carrying on your grandfather's work?

598
01:00:42,562 --> 01:00:44,605
May I take that for a yes?

599
01:00:46,357 --> 01:00:48,067
Very well.

600
01:00:48,192 --> 01:00:51,362
- You can find the way out by yourself?
- Of course.

601
01:00:52,572 --> 01:00:57,118
<i>Until we meet again... Herr Baron.</i>

602
01:00:57,201 --> 01:00:59,787
Yes. Drop by any time. We are always open.

603
01:01:42,874 --> 01:01:44,918
Oh, Victor.

604
01:01:45,585 --> 01:01:47,295
Victor...

605
01:01:47,379 --> 01:01:49,798
We have done it.

606
01:01:53,218 --> 01:01:55,678
I'm going to set you free.

607
01:01:55,804 --> 01:01:58,973
<i>Would you like that, meine Seuchekopf?</i>

608
01:02:08,775 --> 01:02:10,820
They wanted to hurt you.

609
01:02:11,862 --> 01:02:13,906
But I'm going to help you.

610
01:02:15,533 --> 01:02:17,576
Thank heavens that's over with.

611
01:02:18,577 --> 01:02:20,621
<i>Frau Blcher.</i>

612
01:02:22,498 --> 01:02:25,042
Stop. Don't come closer.

613
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:28,254
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to set him free.

614
01:02:28,379 --> 01:02:30,423
No. No, you mustn't.

615
01:02:30,548 --> 01:02:31,924
Yes.

616
01:02:32,925 --> 01:02:35,261
Are you insane? He'll kill you.

617
01:02:36,637 --> 01:02:39,056
No, he won't. Not this one.

618
01:02:39,181 --> 01:02:42,269
He is as gentle as a lamb.

619
01:02:42,394 --> 01:02:46,690
Stand back. Stand back.
For the love of God, he has a rotten brain.

620
01:02:47,274 --> 01:02:49,568
It's not rotten. It's a good brain.

621
01:02:49,693 --> 01:02:52,696
It's rotten, I tell you. Rotten.

622
01:02:53,613 --> 01:02:56,700
Lxnay on the ottenray.

623
01:02:56,825 --> 01:03:00,537
I'm not afraid. I know what he likes.

624
01:03:15,928 --> 01:03:17,972
That music.

625
01:03:18,097 --> 01:03:23,936
Yes. It's in your blood.
It's in the blood of all Frankensteins.

626
01:03:24,062 --> 01:03:28,107
It reaches the soul when words are useless.

627
01:03:28,232 --> 01:03:31,861
Your grandfather used to play it
to the creature he was making.

628
01:03:31,986 --> 01:03:34,572
- Then it was you all the time.
- Yes.

629
01:03:34,697 --> 01:03:37,700
- You played that music in the night.
- Yes.

630
01:03:37,825 --> 01:03:40,579
- To get us into the laboratory.
- Yes.

631
01:03:40,704 --> 01:03:44,291
- That was your cigar in the ashtray.
- Yes.

632
01:03:44,416 --> 01:03:47,795
And it was you who left
my grandfather's book out for me to find.

633
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,171
Yes.

634
01:03:49,296 --> 01:03:51,006
- So that I would...
- Yes.

635
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:53,801
- Then you and Victor were...
- Yes.

636
01:03:53,884 --> 01:03:56,136
Yes! Say it!

637
01:03:56,261 --> 01:04:00,099
He was my boyfriend.

638
01:04:11,986 --> 01:04:14,030
You will never catch him now.

639
01:04:14,155 --> 01:04:17,492
He's free. Do you hear?

640
01:04:17,617 --> 01:04:19,953
Free.

641
01:04:33,591 --> 01:04:35,051
Gone.

642
01:04:35,593 --> 01:04:36,970
Gone!

643
01:04:37,095 --> 01:04:39,597
We've got to find him, do you understand?

644
01:04:39,723 --> 01:04:42,643
We've got to find him
before he kills someone.

645
01:04:43,394 --> 01:04:45,438
What have I done?

646
01:04:45,896 --> 01:04:48,149
Oh, God in heaven.

647
01:04:49,233 --> 01:04:51,277
What have I done?

648
01:04:57,742 --> 01:05:01,120
Oh, I love my pretty little flower

649
01:05:01,579 --> 01:05:05,082
Oh, I love my pretty little flower

650
01:05:05,207 --> 01:05:08,127
Oh, I love my flower

651
01:05:14,468 --> 01:05:16,511
That monster is loose...

652
01:05:17,596 --> 01:05:20,432
Boards must be tight.

653
01:05:22,434 --> 01:05:24,478
There.

654
01:05:26,146 --> 01:05:28,190
Thank God you put Helga to bed.

655
01:05:28,315 --> 01:05:32,611
With all this monster business,
I take no chances. I remember the last time.

656
01:05:32,694 --> 01:05:37,783
<i>But, Papa. I told you that I was turning
the Rostbraten, don't you remember?</i>

657
01:05:37,908 --> 01:05:39,951
I asked you to put Helga to...

658
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:41,996
You...

659
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:49,087
Now throw a kiss and say bye-bye.

660
01:05:57,261 --> 01:05:59,639
Oh, dear. Nothing left.

661
01:05:59,764 --> 01:06:02,350
What shall we throw in now?

662
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:09,399
Maybe she was in the bathroom
when you looked.

663
01:06:09,524 --> 01:06:12,778
But I didn't even look upstairs.
I thought you did.

664
01:06:15,072 --> 01:06:17,116
You didn't look upstairs?

665
01:06:18,867 --> 01:06:20,911
Sit down.

666
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,455
Sit down!

667
01:07:11,297 --> 01:07:14,050
A visitor is all I ask.

668
01:07:14,133 --> 01:07:18,763
A temporary companion to help me
pass a few short hours in my lonely life.

669
01:07:22,808 --> 01:07:26,062
Thank you, Lord. Thank you.

670
01:07:35,821 --> 01:07:38,908
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't speak. Don't say a word.

671
01:07:39,492 --> 01:07:42,662
Oh, my joy and my prize from heaven.

672
01:07:43,538 --> 01:07:46,708
Oh, you must have been
the tallest one in your class.

673
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:50,462
My name is Harold and I live here all alone.

674
01:07:50,587 --> 01:07:52,381
What is your name?

675
01:07:52,506 --> 01:07:54,716
I didn't get that.

676
01:07:55,675 --> 01:07:57,386
No...

677
01:07:58,053 --> 01:07:59,846
Forgive me.

678
01:07:59,930 --> 01:08:02,933
I didn't realise you were a mute.

679
01:08:03,016 --> 01:08:05,060
You see how heaven plans.

680
01:08:05,185 --> 01:08:08,563
Me, a poor blind man, and you a mute.

681
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:13,111
An incredibly big mute.

682
01:08:13,236 --> 01:08:15,530
But your hand is frozen, my child.

683
01:08:15,655 --> 01:08:18,324
How does a nice bowl of soup sound, huh?

684
01:08:28,668 --> 01:08:32,505
Well, I know what it means
to be cold and hungry.

685
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:33,673
Yes...

686
01:08:33,798 --> 01:08:37,468
And how much it means to have
a little kindness from a stranger.

687
01:08:37,593 --> 01:08:40,346
Are you ready for your soup?

688
01:08:42,057 --> 01:08:44,893
Hold out your bowl, then.

689
01:08:46,562 --> 01:08:48,522
Oh, my friend...

690
01:08:48,647 --> 01:08:51,191
You don't know what your visit means to me.

691
01:08:51,316 --> 01:08:54,945
How long I've waited for the pleasure
of another human being.

692
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:58,824
Sometimes in our preoccupation
with worldly matters,

693
01:09:00,659 --> 01:09:04,538
we tend to forget the simple pleasures

694
01:09:04,663 --> 01:09:07,916
that are the basis for true happiness.

695
01:09:09,418 --> 01:09:12,422
And now a little wine with your soup?

696
01:09:14,257 --> 01:09:16,301
Good, good.

697
01:09:25,393 --> 01:09:28,063
Huh? Good. Yes.

698
01:09:32,442 --> 01:09:34,778
Wait!

699
01:09:34,903 --> 01:09:37,280
A toast.

700
01:09:37,405 --> 01:09:41,076
A toast to long friendship.

701
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,543
How hungry you must have been.

702
01:09:49,668 --> 01:09:52,129
Now for a little surprise.

703
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:55,007
For a special occasion, I've been saving...

704
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:02,264
...cigars.

705
01:10:03,891 --> 01:10:05,684
Take one.

706
01:10:09,355 --> 01:10:10,189
What?

707
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:12,317
No, no, no.

708
01:10:12,984 --> 01:10:14,945
Fire is good.

709
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:18,573
Fire is good. Yes, fire is our friend.

710
01:10:18,698 --> 01:10:20,992
Yes. I'll show you.

711
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:31,670
You see?

712
01:10:32,337 --> 01:10:34,131
You have your cigar?

713
01:10:34,214 --> 01:10:36,258
Let me see. Let me see.

714
01:10:36,383 --> 01:10:38,009
All right.

715
01:10:38,093 --> 01:10:40,137
Now, now, now...

716
01:10:40,804 --> 01:10:43,141
Just hold it right there. Now,

717
01:10:43,891 --> 01:10:47,061
don't inhale until the tip glows.

718
01:11:05,455 --> 01:11:07,498
Wait.

719
01:11:09,542 --> 01:11:11,085
Wait.

720
01:11:11,169 --> 01:11:13,213
Where are you going?

721
01:11:13,797 --> 01:11:17,259
I was gonna make espresso.

722
01:12:00,804 --> 01:12:01,888
Now!

723
01:12:06,601 --> 01:12:08,645
Quick. Give him the sedative.

724
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,124
He's out.

725
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:30,876
I know.

726
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:44,099
I'm going in there. Bring me that candle.

727
01:12:44,224 --> 01:12:46,268
- No.
- Yes.

728
01:12:50,939 --> 01:12:52,899
Love

729
01:12:53,024 --> 01:12:56,445
is the only thing
that can save this poor creature.

730
01:12:57,154 --> 01:13:00,240
And I am going to convince him
that he is loved

731
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:04,453
even at the cost of my own life.

732
01:13:06,496 --> 01:13:10,876
No matter what you hear in there,
no matter how cruelly I beg you,

733
01:13:11,501 --> 01:13:14,422
no matter how terribly I may scream,

734
01:13:15,381 --> 01:13:19,761
do not open this door,
or you will undo everything I've worked for.

735
01:13:19,886 --> 01:13:21,429
Do you understand?

736
01:13:21,554 --> 01:13:24,724
Do not open this door.

737
01:13:24,807 --> 01:13:26,267
Yes, Doctor.

738
01:13:28,561 --> 01:13:30,605
Nice working with you.

739
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:05,974
Let me out. Let me out of here.
Get me the hell out of here.

740
01:14:06,725 --> 01:14:09,478
What's the matter with you people?
I was joking.

741
01:14:09,603 --> 01:14:11,814
Don't you know ajoke when you hear one?

742
01:14:15,485 --> 01:14:18,822
Jesus Christ. Get me outta here!

743
01:14:21,282 --> 01:14:24,953
Open this goddamn door
or I'll kick your rotten heads in.

744
01:14:25,078 --> 01:14:26,621
Mommy!

745
01:14:34,963 --> 01:14:36,840
Obviously...

746
01:14:40,927 --> 01:14:43,305
Hello, handsome.

747
01:14:46,308 --> 01:14:48,686
You're a good-looking fellow, you know?

748
01:14:48,811 --> 01:14:51,313
People laugh at you.

749
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:54,191
People hate you, but why do they hate you?

750
01:14:54,316 --> 01:14:58,154
Because they are jealous.

751
01:14:59,405 --> 01:15:02,074
Look at that boyish face.

752
01:15:04,034 --> 01:15:06,078
Look at that sweet smile.

753
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:10,916
Do you wanna talk about physical strength?

754
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,337
Do you want to talk about sheer muscle?

755
01:15:15,797 --> 01:15:18,967
Do you want to talk
about the Olympian ideal?

756
01:15:19,092 --> 01:15:21,762
You are a god!

757
01:15:22,721 --> 01:15:24,765
And listen to me...

758
01:15:25,682 --> 01:15:28,226
You are not evil.

759
01:15:29,686 --> 01:15:33,982
You are good!

760
01:15:42,115 --> 01:15:45,119
This is a nice boy.

761
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:47,914
This is a good boy.

762
01:15:48,873 --> 01:15:51,250
This is a mother's angel.

763
01:15:52,085 --> 01:15:54,754
And I want the world to know,

764
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:59,217
once and for all and without any shame,

765
01:16:00,927 --> 01:16:03,679
that we love him.

766
01:16:07,642 --> 01:16:10,228
I'm going to teach you.

767
01:16:10,353 --> 01:16:15,234
I'm gonna show you how to walk,
how to speak, how to move, how to think.

768
01:16:16,318 --> 01:16:17,945
Together,

769
01:16:18,028 --> 01:16:20,072
you and I

770
01:16:20,155 --> 01:16:26,161
are going to make
the greatest single contribution to science

771
01:16:27,037 --> 01:16:29,790
since the creation of fire!

772
01:16:30,374 --> 01:16:33,836
Dr Fronkonsteen. Are you all right?

773
01:16:33,961 --> 01:16:36,004
My name...

774
01:16:36,839 --> 01:16:40,092
...is Frankenstein!

775
01:17:33,731 --> 01:17:37,234
Distinguished colleagues,
ladies and gentlemen.

776
01:17:37,318 --> 01:17:39,445
Tonight it is my great privilege

777
01:17:39,570 --> 01:17:43,867
of introducing to you a man
whose family name was once both

778
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:45,994
famous

779
01:17:46,119 --> 01:17:48,371
and infamous.

780
01:17:48,955 --> 01:17:55,420
<i>And now may I present to you
Doktor Baron Friedrich von Frankenstein.</i>

781
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:06,306
My fellow scienti...

782
01:18:07,557 --> 01:18:12,479
...tists... and neurosurgeons,
ladies and gentlemen.

783
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:16,109
A few short weeks ago,
coming from a background,

784
01:18:16,234 --> 01:18:21,406
believe me, as conservative and traditionally
grounded in scientific fact as any of you,

785
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:26,494
I began an experiment in,
incredulous as it may sound,

786
01:18:27,662 --> 01:18:30,206
the reanimation of dead tissue.

787
01:18:33,418 --> 01:18:37,880
What I have to offer you might possibly be

788
01:18:38,005 --> 01:18:40,842
the gateway to immortality.

789
01:18:46,098 --> 01:18:52,020
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present for
your intellectual and philosophical pleasure

790
01:18:53,856 --> 01:18:55,899
the Creature.

791
01:19:02,322 --> 01:19:04,450
Remain in your seats, I beg you.

792
01:19:04,575 --> 01:19:07,911
We are not children here. We are scientists.

793
01:19:08,871 --> 01:19:11,248
I assure you there is nothing to fear.

794
01:19:14,878 --> 01:19:18,631
First may I offer for your consideration

795
01:19:18,757 --> 01:19:23,386
a neurological demonstration
of the primary cerebellar functions.

796
01:19:24,345 --> 01:19:27,432
Balance and coordination.

797
01:19:29,809 --> 01:19:32,812
Walk heel to toe.

798
01:19:46,410 --> 01:19:48,454
Backwards.

799
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:09,266
Ladies and gentlemen, you've seen
the Creature perform simple motor activity,

800
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:14,231
but for what you will see next
we must enter quietly

801
01:20:14,356 --> 01:20:17,526
into the realm of genius.

802
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,364
Ladies and gentlemen,

803
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:30,747
from what was once
an inarticulate mass of lifeless tissues,

804
01:20:30,831 --> 01:20:34,876
may I now present
a cultured, sophisticated

805
01:20:36,294 --> 01:20:38,088
man about town.

806
01:20:42,217 --> 01:20:43,468
Hit it.

807
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:30,204
Nothing. Nothing, I tell you.

808
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,790
Five, six, seven, eight...

809
01:22:36,127 --> 01:22:39,296
Come on. Are you trying
to make me look like a fool?

810
01:22:44,343 --> 01:22:45,721
Please. I beg you.

811
01:22:45,846 --> 01:22:48,598
For safety's sake, don't humiliate him.

812
01:22:51,852 --> 01:22:55,897
Come back. Do you hear me?
I will not let you destroy my work.

813
01:22:55,981 --> 01:22:58,650
As your creator
I command you to come back.

814
01:23:52,289 --> 01:23:54,083
Chained.

815
01:23:54,166 --> 01:23:56,835
Chained like a beast in a cage.

816
01:23:57,795 --> 01:24:00,255
Oh, Doctor. I feel so terrible.

817
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:02,424
There's only one answer.

818
01:24:02,549 --> 01:24:07,262
If I could find a way to equalise
the imbalance in his cerebral-spinal fluid,

819
01:24:07,387 --> 01:24:10,224
why, he'd be as right as rain.

820
01:24:10,974 --> 01:24:12,601
But how?

821
01:24:12,726 --> 01:24:14,978
How, before it's too late?

822
01:24:16,231 --> 01:24:17,941
Oh, Frederick...

823
01:24:18,066 --> 01:24:20,193
If only there was some way I could...

824
01:24:21,319 --> 01:24:23,988
...relieve this torture you are going through.

825
01:24:26,199 --> 01:24:28,243
If there was some way I could help to...

826
01:24:30,078 --> 01:24:35,667
...relieve the tension. If there was just
some way I could give you a little peace.

827
01:24:43,591 --> 01:24:45,636
Doctor, I have...

828
01:24:45,761 --> 01:24:47,638
Doctor?

829
01:24:48,681 --> 01:24:50,725
What is it?

830
01:24:53,227 --> 01:24:55,104
Doctor...

831
01:24:55,187 --> 01:24:57,398
Where are you?

832
01:25:10,619 --> 01:25:14,206
I'm sorry, Doctor.
This cable came while you were gone.

833
01:25:14,290 --> 01:25:19,171
I thought I told you never to
interrupt me while I'm working.

834
01:25:20,505 --> 01:25:24,176
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I thought this was an emergency.

835
01:25:24,301 --> 01:25:28,221
You see, your fiance
will be arriving any second.

836
01:25:28,346 --> 01:25:30,932
What? Elizabeth here tonight?

837
01:25:31,058 --> 01:25:34,394
Yes. I will go prepare a room at once.

838
01:25:36,021 --> 01:25:38,356
I suggest you put on a tie.

839
01:25:58,419 --> 01:26:00,546
Darling.

840
01:26:00,671 --> 01:26:02,757
Darling.

841
01:26:02,882 --> 01:26:04,425
- Surprised?
- Surprised.

842
01:26:04,509 --> 01:26:06,552
- Love me?
- Love you?

843
01:26:07,553 --> 01:26:09,597
Well...

844
01:26:10,389 --> 01:26:13,059
- Let's turn in.
- Darling.

845
01:26:13,142 --> 01:26:17,773
It's been a long day. I'm sure you're very tired.
I'll just pay the driver.

846
01:26:18,649 --> 01:26:21,318
- Darling.
- What?

847
01:26:21,902 --> 01:26:24,405
- Surprised?
- Yes.

848
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:26,573
- Love me?
- Well...

849
01:26:26,698 --> 01:26:28,951
Well, let's turn in.

850
01:26:29,076 --> 01:26:30,619
- Darling.
- Yes.

851
01:26:30,744 --> 01:26:32,454
Say nothing, act casual.

852
01:26:32,538 --> 01:26:35,207
- Ready?
- Yes. I think...

853
01:26:35,916 --> 01:26:37,626
Yes.

854
01:26:37,751 --> 01:26:39,795
I am a bit tired after all.

855
01:26:42,005 --> 01:26:45,175
I'd like you to meet
my assistants, Inga and I-gor.

856
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,345
How do you do?

857
01:26:48,263 --> 01:26:49,264
How do you do?

858
01:26:49,389 --> 01:26:53,685
- This is my financier Elizabeth.
- I'm so happy to meet you at last.

859
01:26:53,768 --> 01:26:54,769
Finance.

860
01:26:54,894 --> 01:27:00,233
Excuse me, darling.
What is it exactly that you... do do?

861
01:27:02,986 --> 01:27:07,031
Well, I assist Dr Fronkonsteen
in the laboratory.

862
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:09,868
<i>We have intellectual discussions und we...</i>

863
01:27:09,993 --> 01:27:12,328
As a matter of fact, we were just having one...

864
01:27:12,454 --> 01:27:13,830
- May I?
- What?

865
01:27:13,955 --> 01:27:15,582
Wait a minute...

866
01:27:15,707 --> 01:27:18,461
l-gor, would you give me
a hand with the bags?

867
01:27:18,544 --> 01:27:23,007
Certainly, you take the blonde
and I'll take the one in the turban.

868
01:27:27,845 --> 01:27:30,514
Stop that. I'm talking about the luggage.

869
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:32,266
Yes, master.

870
01:27:32,933 --> 01:27:34,977
Ladies, this way.

871
01:27:36,729 --> 01:27:40,441
It'll be a long night.
If you need any help with the girls...

872
01:27:47,908 --> 01:27:50,160
You settle down now.

873
01:27:50,285 --> 01:27:53,455
Cos we gonna be pals.

874
01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:55,999
Right?

875
01:27:58,585 --> 01:28:00,629
Nice and cosy.

876
01:28:00,754 --> 01:28:03,840
Just like old friends.

877
01:28:12,933 --> 01:28:16,979
What's the matter?
You're afraid of this little fire?

878
01:28:17,063 --> 01:28:18,940
This can't hurt you.

879
01:28:19,023 --> 01:28:21,067
See?

880
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,237
Some monster you are.

881
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,447
See, Mama was right.

882
01:28:26,572 --> 01:28:30,034
Little boys ain't supposed to play with fire.

883
01:28:31,285 --> 01:28:33,955
Is they? Cos they might get hurt.

884
01:29:02,109 --> 01:29:03,652
Halt!

885
01:29:03,777 --> 01:29:05,487
Up.

886
01:29:05,571 --> 01:29:08,240
A riot is an ugly thing.

887
01:29:09,283 --> 01:29:13,495
<i>Und I think that it is just about time
that we had one.</i>

888
01:29:15,914 --> 01:29:17,459
Kill the monster.

889
01:29:17,834 --> 01:29:21,004
As heaven is my witness... Up.

890
01:29:21,087 --> 01:29:24,716
...he will curse the day

891
01:29:24,841 --> 01:29:28,636
that he was burn a Frankenstein.

892
01:29:29,637 --> 01:29:30,638
What?

893
01:29:31,639 --> 01:29:36,352
I said: "He will curse the day
that he was born a Frankenstein."

894
01:29:52,787 --> 01:29:56,415
Loose. He's broken loose.

895
01:29:56,540 --> 01:29:58,834
Do you know what that means?

896
01:29:58,959 --> 01:30:01,629
Darling, you mustn't worry so.

897
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:06,050
I suppose you're right.

898
01:30:06,175 --> 01:30:08,052
Of course I am.

899
01:30:08,177 --> 01:30:10,221
Now come along like a good boy.

900
01:30:10,763 --> 01:30:12,723
What would I do without you?

901
01:30:12,807 --> 01:30:17,437
Is your room just down the hall
in case I get the frights during the night?

902
01:30:18,021 --> 01:30:22,901
Well, yes, but I thought perhaps tonight,
under the circumstances, I might

903
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:25,612
stay here with you.

904
01:30:25,737 --> 01:30:28,323
Would you want me like this now?

905
01:30:28,448 --> 01:30:32,160
So soon before our wedding,
so near we can almost touch it?

906
01:30:34,955 --> 01:30:37,207
- Yes!
- Whoa, boy.

907
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,252
Or

908
01:30:40,377 --> 01:30:46,133
to waitjust a little while longer when
I can give myself to you without hesitation,

909
01:30:46,258 --> 01:30:50,138
when I can be totally
and unashamedly and legally yours?

910
01:30:54,308 --> 01:30:56,894
That's a tough choice.

911
01:30:57,019 --> 01:30:59,272
You're a tough guy.

912
01:31:01,983 --> 01:31:03,860
I suppose you're right.

913
01:31:03,943 --> 01:31:05,987
Of course I am. I always am.

914
01:31:07,155 --> 01:31:09,699
Now give me a kiss and say good night.

915
01:31:12,994 --> 01:31:15,037
No tongues.

916
01:31:22,129 --> 01:31:24,631
Good night, darling.

917
01:31:24,798 --> 01:31:27,134
Good night, sweetheart.

918
01:31:27,259 --> 01:31:29,470
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

919
01:31:29,595 --> 01:31:33,515
You love me? I love you, honey.

920
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:36,018
- Sweet dreams, darling.
- Sweet dreams.

921
01:31:36,143 --> 01:31:39,480
Good night, don't let the bedbugs bite.

922
01:31:45,611 --> 01:31:51,701
He has loosed the fateful lightning
of his terrible swift sword

923
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:55,330
His truth is marching on

924
01:31:57,499 --> 01:32:01,795
Glory, glory, hallelujah...

925
01:32:56,893 --> 01:32:58,937
Where am I?

926
01:33:01,273 --> 01:33:03,859
Who are you? What are you?

927
01:33:03,984 --> 01:33:06,737
What do you want?
What are you going to do to me?

928
01:33:07,738 --> 01:33:09,698
Calm down.

929
01:33:09,781 --> 01:33:11,658
I'm not afraid of you.

930
01:33:11,742 --> 01:33:15,787
My father is very rich.
You'd have the world at your fingertips.

931
01:33:15,912 --> 01:33:22,253
Listen. I have to be back by 11.30.
I'm expecting a very important call.

932
01:33:23,212 --> 01:33:25,465
Speak! Why don't you speak?

933
01:33:25,590 --> 01:33:27,633
What are you doing?

934
01:33:27,759 --> 01:33:30,011
Oh, no, you can't be serious.

935
01:33:32,346 --> 01:33:34,390
I'm af...

936
01:33:35,183 --> 01:33:37,143
Oh, my God.

937
01:33:37,268 --> 01:33:38,269
Woof.

938
01:33:41,731 --> 01:33:43,357
I'm engaged.

939
01:33:43,483 --> 01:33:46,152
And once he... But I didn't... It was never...

940
01:33:52,826 --> 01:33:55,079
Sweet mystery of life

941
01:33:55,204 --> 01:33:58,207
At last I found you

942
01:33:58,791 --> 01:34:04,379
At last I know the secret of it all

943
01:34:36,204 --> 01:34:38,748
Penny for your thoughts.

944
01:34:40,875 --> 01:34:43,795
You're incorrigible, aren't you?

945
01:34:44,170 --> 01:34:46,714
You little zipper-neck.

946
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:51,470
All right.

947
01:34:51,554 --> 01:34:54,223
Seven has always been my lucky number.

948
01:34:55,641 --> 01:34:58,394
Come over here, you hot monster.

949
01:35:01,856 --> 01:35:04,692
What is it? What's the matter?

950
01:35:05,818 --> 01:35:07,987
Is it that music?

951
01:35:08,112 --> 01:35:11,907
It's probably from some nearby cottage.
Nothing to worry about.

952
01:35:12,032 --> 01:35:14,076
Where are you going? Where...

953
01:35:14,452 --> 01:35:16,412
You men are all alike.

954
01:35:16,537 --> 01:35:19,541
Seven or eight quick ones
and you're off with the boys.

955
01:35:19,624 --> 01:35:23,253
To boast and brag.
You better keep your mouth shut.

956
01:35:23,795 --> 01:35:26,548
Oh, I think I love him.

957
01:36:13,346 --> 01:36:16,808
Look, he's coming back.
Look, the music...

958
01:36:17,475 --> 01:36:19,478
Keep playing. It's the music.

959
01:36:19,603 --> 01:36:22,606
It's the music that's bringing him back.

960
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:27,111
Come on.

961
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:36,912
Come on. Come.

962
01:36:42,042 --> 01:36:44,253
Come on. You can do it.

963
01:36:50,093 --> 01:36:52,762
Come on. You can do it.

964
01:36:59,018 --> 01:37:02,939
Don't touch him!
He wants to do it by himself.

965
01:37:03,606 --> 01:37:06,609
You can do it. You can do it.

966
01:37:07,402 --> 01:37:09,904
Please, my creation.

967
01:37:20,249 --> 01:37:22,293
Quick. Catch him.

968
01:37:27,298 --> 01:37:30,801
Have all the preparations
been made for the transference?

969
01:37:30,926 --> 01:37:32,386
Yes, Doctor.

970
01:37:32,511 --> 01:37:35,014
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

971
01:37:35,139 --> 01:37:37,600
It's the only thing that can save him now.

972
01:37:38,225 --> 01:37:41,312
You realise you're risking both your lives?

973
01:37:43,773 --> 01:37:45,816
Yes.

974
01:37:58,538 --> 01:38:00,582
Switching off.

975
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,772
How will I know when they are done?

976
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:25,191
The doctor said to allow 15 minutes.

977
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:28,111
Not one second more

978
01:38:28,194 --> 01:38:29,987
or less.

979
01:38:38,621 --> 01:38:40,331
How long now?

980
01:38:40,415 --> 01:38:42,041
Two minutes.

981
01:39:04,481 --> 01:39:06,525
- What's that noise?
- I don't know.

982
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:08,944
- What time is it?
- Almost time.

983
01:39:13,574 --> 01:39:16,493
Oh, my God. It's the villagers.

984
01:39:18,704 --> 01:39:20,957
No! No! Please.

985
01:39:21,082 --> 01:39:23,334
Just another seven seconds.

986
01:39:26,629 --> 01:39:28,673
No! No!

987
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:32,343
No! No! No!

988
01:39:33,052 --> 01:39:35,805
- Put that man down.
- It's the monster.

989
01:39:35,930 --> 01:39:37,724
- No, it can't be.
- It is.

990
01:39:37,807 --> 01:39:40,477
I said: "Put that man down."

991
01:39:49,820 --> 01:39:52,490
<i>Und just who do you think you are</i>

992
01:39:52,573 --> 01:39:55,493
that you order these people about?

993
01:39:55,618 --> 01:39:57,661
I am the monster.

994
01:39:59,747 --> 01:40:02,500
<i>Ja. I see that you are the monster.</i>

995
01:40:02,625 --> 01:40:05,294
For as long as I can remember

996
01:40:05,377 --> 01:40:07,880
people have hated me.

997
01:40:08,172 --> 01:40:11,342
They looked at my face and my body

998
01:40:11,467 --> 01:40:13,511
and they ran away in horror.

999
01:40:13,636 --> 01:40:20,352
In my loneliness, I decided that if I could not
inspire love, which was my deepest hope,

1000
01:40:20,477 --> 01:40:22,646
I would instead cause fear.

1001
01:40:24,815 --> 01:40:26,858
I live,

1002
01:40:28,151 --> 01:40:33,406
because this poor, half-crazed
genius has given me life.

1003
01:40:33,990 --> 01:40:36,034
He alone held an image of me

1004
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:38,537
as something beautiful.

1005
01:40:38,954 --> 01:40:40,831
And then,

1006
01:40:40,956 --> 01:40:44,793
when it would have been easy enough
to stay out of danger,

1007
01:40:45,293 --> 01:40:48,380
he used his own body as a guinea pig

1008
01:40:48,463 --> 01:40:51,134
to give me a calmer brain

1009
01:40:52,218 --> 01:40:58,474
and a somewhat more
sophisticated way of expressing myself.

1010
01:40:58,599 --> 01:41:03,396
Well, this is, of course,
an entirely different situation.

1011
01:41:04,105 --> 01:41:06,774
As the leader of this community,

1012
01:41:06,899 --> 01:41:10,611
may I be the first to offer you my hand

1013
01:41:11,362 --> 01:41:13,406
in friendship.

1014
01:41:19,454 --> 01:41:21,832
- Thank you.
- You are entirely welcome.

1015
01:41:21,957 --> 01:41:26,879
<i>Und now let us all go to my house
for a little sponge cake und a little wine...</i>

1016
01:41:28,213 --> 01:41:30,257
<i>... und shit!</i>

1017
01:41:32,801 --> 01:41:34,845
To the lumberyard!

1018
01:41:58,661 --> 01:42:01,247
Hello, Mrs Frankenstein.

1019
01:42:01,998 --> 01:42:05,251
Mrs Frankenstein. What a beautiful name.

1020
01:42:05,376 --> 01:42:07,087
Oh, darling.

1021
01:42:07,170 --> 01:42:09,214
Hold on to your hat.

1022
01:42:10,673 --> 01:42:11,591
What?

1023
01:42:11,716 --> 01:42:14,719
I'll be right back.

1024
01:42:28,984 --> 01:42:31,570
I'm holding on to it, darling.

1025
01:42:32,613 --> 01:42:35,074
Just a few more seconds.

1026
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:19,369
Honey, I hope you didn't find
Daddy's little party too boring.

1027
01:43:19,494 --> 01:43:22,915
He did itjust for you
and he meant so well. Say you liked it.

1028
01:43:24,250 --> 01:43:26,294
Honey, did you see?

1029
01:43:26,419 --> 01:43:29,922
I put a special hamper in the bathroom
just for your shirts

1030
01:43:30,006 --> 01:43:33,092
and the other one is just for socks
and poo-poo undies.

1031
01:43:33,217 --> 01:43:34,927
Here I come.

1032
01:44:04,041 --> 01:44:06,543
The feeling is mutual.

1033
01:44:08,837 --> 01:44:10,881
You know, it's a puzzlement.

1034
01:44:11,006 --> 01:44:15,469
There's something I've always wanted
to ask you about that operation.

1035
01:44:15,594 --> 01:44:17,805
You know in the transference part,

1036
01:44:17,888 --> 01:44:23,394
the monster got part of your wonderful brain,
but what did you ever get from him?

1037
01:44:33,113 --> 01:44:36,116
No. I don't believe...

1038
01:44:40,328 --> 01:44:42,539
Sweet mystery of life

1039
01:44:42,664 --> 01:44:45,416
At last I found you

1040
01:45:33,133 --> 01:45:35,177
