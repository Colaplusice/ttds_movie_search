1
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:05,434
Tracy!

2
00:03:05,505 --> 00:03:07,063
Tracy!

3
00:03:21,854 --> 00:03:22,980
Tracy!

4
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:25,422
-How do you spell "'omelet"'?
-Oh, you.

5
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:29,587
Ninety-four for the ceremony
and 506 for the reception.

6
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:31,721
l don<i>'</i>t know where
we<i>'</i>ll put them if it rains.

7
00:03:31,798 --> 00:03:34,198
lt won<i>'</i>t rain.
Tracy won<i>'</i>t stand for it.

8
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:38,499
-Mother, how do you spell "'omelet"'?
-O-M-M-E-L-E-T.

9
00:03:38,571 --> 00:03:42,007
-l thought there was another "'L."'
-An omelet<i>'</i>s a funny wedding present.

10
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:45,943
-lt was a silver dish, dear.
-Bring some of that junk off the table.

11
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:48,446
Be an angel and get these
things out of the way.

12
00:03:48,514 --> 00:03:50,505
Yes, darling.

13
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:56,554
This stinks.

14
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:59,491
Don<i>'</i>t say "'stinks,"' darling.

15
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:02,494
lf absolutely necessary, "'smells."'

16
00:04:02,562 --> 00:04:04,587
These cards have
been changed again.

17
00:04:04,664 --> 00:04:08,657
There must be a ghost in the house,
the ghost of bridegroom number one.

18
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:11,101
Don<i>'</i>t talk about Dexter
as though he were dead.

19
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,604
-He may as well be, for all Tracy cares.
-Right.

20
00:04:13,673 --> 00:04:15,004
l wouldn<i>'</i>t say that.

21
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:18,009
lf l never see
Mr. C.K. Dexter Haven again, l<i>'</i>ll be--

22
00:04:18,077 --> 00:04:20,409
-lsn<i>'</i>t that awful?
-They<i>'</i>re friends of your father<i>'</i>s.

23
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,610
What are they, tap dancers
or just musical comedy producers?

24
00:04:24,684 --> 00:04:27,414
That<i>'</i>s hardly fair to your
father<i>'</i>s interest in the art.

25
00:04:27,487 --> 00:04:31,583
Art, my eye! The art of putting up
$100,000 to display the shapely legs--

26
00:04:31,657 --> 00:04:34,387
-That will do, Tracy.
-l give up.

27
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:39,964
lf you<i>'</i>d just face the facts
squarely, as l did--

28
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:44,492
We<i>'</i>d face the fact that neither of us
has proved to be a success as a wife.

29
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,006
We just picked the wrong
first husbands, that<i>'</i>s all.

30
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:51,271
Don<i>'</i>t let<i>'</i>s argue about it.
You wanted me to take a stand, so l did.

31
00:04:51,344 --> 00:04:54,677
lt<i>'</i>s the only stand a woman could take
and keep her self-respect.

32
00:04:54,747 --> 00:04:56,510
Yes, dear, l know.

33
00:04:56,582 --> 00:04:59,483
Now l have my self-respect
and no husband.

34
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:02,715
You almost talk as though
you wanted him back.

35
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:04,654
He wouldn<i>'</i>t come back, probably.

36
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:08,125
Hey, it<i>'</i>s better this way, really.
You<i>'</i>ll see.

37
00:05:08,194 --> 00:05:12,221
Let<i>'</i>s forget about the past. We both
deserve some happiness, especially you.

38
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:14,061
-Darling.
-lsn<i>'</i>t George an angel?

39
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:16,533
-George is an angel.
-ls he handsome or is he not?

40
00:05:16,602 --> 00:05:17,694
George is handsome.

41
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,262
-l liked Dexter.
-Why don<i>'</i>t you postpone the wedding?

42
00:05:22,508 --> 00:05:23,941
-How?
-Get smallpox.

43
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,945
-Don<i>'</i>t put the idea in her head.
-George isn<i>'</i>t usually late.

44
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:29,277
-He<i>'</i>s waiting at the stables.
-Waiting--

45
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:32,784
-lf l don<i>'</i>t choke her before Saturday.
-lt<i>'</i>d postpone the wedding.

46
00:05:32,852 --> 00:05:35,377
lt would not.
Be in the car when l get down.

47
00:05:36,222 --> 00:05:38,156
She<i>'</i>s so mean about Dexter.

48
00:05:38,224 --> 00:05:39,816
He was rather mean to her.

49
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:42,326
-Did he really sock her?
-Please, Dinah.

50
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:45,455
-Did he really?
-Darling, go out and wait in the car.

51
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:48,091
-The papers were full of "'innundo."'
-Of what?

52
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:51,227
Of "'innundo."'
"'Cruelty and drunkenness,"' it said.

53
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:57,232
Mother, why won<i>'</i>t Tracy ask
her own father to the wedding?

54
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,006
Your sister has very definite
opinions about certain things.

55
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,569
She<i>'</i>s sort of--

56
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:05,083
Well, you know,
hard, isn<i>'</i>t she?

57
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:06,550
Certainly not.

58
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:09,850
Tracy sets exceptionally high standards
for herself, that<i>'</i>s all...

59
00:06:09,922 --> 00:06:13,358
and other people aren<i>'</i>t always
quite apt to live up to them.

60
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:18,389
But don<i>'</i>t you think it<i>'</i>s stinking
not at least to want Father?

61
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:22,127
Yes, darling. Between ourselves,
l think it<i>'</i>s good and stinking.

62
00:06:23,202 --> 00:06:25,602
Oh, l wish something would happen.

63
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:29,072
Nothing ever possibly
in the least ever happens here.

64
00:06:30,943 --> 00:06:32,205
Mother...

65
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:35,377
how do you get smallpox?

66
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:38,212
Oh, Dinah, please go. Go.

67
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:56,562
This is Uncle Willie<i>'</i>s favorite:
Complete Surrender.

68
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:24,462
Where<i>'</i>d you get this
idiotic thing anyway?

69
00:07:27,066 --> 00:07:30,263
Never play with fire, child,
particularly on the eve of your wedding.

70
00:07:30,336 --> 00:07:32,736
You<i>'</i>re really a wicked old man,
aren<i>'</i>t you?

71
00:07:32,805 --> 00:07:34,670
Who takes this, your cook?

72
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,038
l love it. lt<i>'</i>s got
pictures of everything.

73
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:39,111
lt certainly has.

74
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:39,338
lt certainly has.

75
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:43,872
Who is that terribly attractive man?
Can Tracy pick <i>'</i>em, or can she?

76
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,180
-lf you<i>'</i>re asking me--
-l<i>'</i>m not.

77
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:48,777
-Hello, darling.
-Hello!

78
00:07:48,854 --> 00:07:52,381
-How do you like me?
-l adore you, but you look awful.

79
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,949
-Awful?
-Like something out of a shop window.

80
00:07:59,198 --> 00:08:00,961
Cut it out!
They<i>'</i>re new!

81
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:03,263
They<i>'</i>re new,
but they<i>'</i>re not going to be.

82
00:08:03,336 --> 00:08:05,804
-There, that<i>'</i>s better.
-l don<i>'</i>t get it.

83
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:08,840
When l was a coal miner, l wanted
enough money to buy clean clothes.

84
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:10,535
Now that l<i>'</i>m general manager--

85
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:13,806
Dinah, is there anything
in there about the wedding?

86
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,006
-What do you mean?
-l thought maybe...

87
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:19,176
you being one of the oldest
families in Philadelphia...

88
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:21,481
and me getting fairly
important myself...

89
00:08:21,554 --> 00:08:24,648
it<i>'</i>s luck, of course, but l--
What<i>'</i>s the matter?

90
00:08:24,724 --> 00:08:27,215
"'An average day in the life
of a congressman.

91
00:08:27,293 --> 00:08:29,784
"'The congressman<i>'</i>s wife.
The kitchen, where is prepared...

92
00:08:29,862 --> 00:08:31,955
"'one banana, sliced,
two fried eggs.

93
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:34,966
-"'The congressman kisses his wife."'
-Lots of people like publicity.

94
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:38,993
Of all the filthy ideas, coming
into a private house with a camera.

95
00:08:40,106 --> 00:08:43,735
George Kittredge, you get on that horse.
What do you think of that?

96
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,778
What would happen if someday
l got into politics?

97
00:08:46,846 --> 00:08:49,644
-You<i>'</i>d be elected President.
-l don<i>'</i>t know about that.

98
00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:51,979
-l mean about publicity.
-Not in my home.

99
00:08:52,051 --> 00:08:54,178
You mean our home, don<i>'</i>t you?

100
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:58,755
Sorry, darling.
l mean very much our home.

101
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:09,133
Never mind, Eddie.
l<i>'</i>ll get up myself.

102
00:09:10,603 --> 00:09:12,093
Steady, Bessie.

103
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,835
Whoa, Bessie. Whoa.

104
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,942
Steady, Bessie.

105
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:29,952
Grab the reins, George,
with the left hand.

106
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:34,615
-Put salt on his tail.
-Shut up.

107
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:36,126
Steady, Bessie.

108
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:39,320
There. Whoa, Bessie.

109
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:43,467
What<i>'</i>s the matter, Bessie?
You act worried.

110
00:09:43,536 --> 00:09:45,561
Maybe it<i>'</i>s because his name is Jack.

111
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:50,432
Hi-ho, Silver.

112
00:10:03,656 --> 00:10:05,715
That does the trick.
Hello, Joe.

113
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,315
-Hi, Mike.
-l won<i>'</i>t do it, Liz.

114
00:10:07,393 --> 00:10:11,557
l<i>'</i>m gonna tell Sidney Kidd very plainly
l<i>'</i>m a writer, not a society snoop.

115
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,463
-l<i>'</i>m gonna tell him just that.
-Just that.

116
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:18,336
Let Kidd fire me!

117
00:10:18,404 --> 00:10:21,601
Start writin<i>'</i> short stories again.
That<i>'</i>s what l should be doin<i>'</i>.

118
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:24,199
-l<i>'</i>m gonna tell him just that.
-Just that.

119
00:10:30,349 --> 00:10:31,509
Come in.

120
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:43,025
-l don<i>'</i>t think you<i>'</i>re being fair.
-No?

121
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:45,586
You<i>'</i>re treating me like you
treat all your other writers.

122
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,861
You really hate me,
don<i>'</i>t you, Connor?

123
00:10:49,935 --> 00:10:52,870
No. l don<i>'</i>t like you
very much, though.

124
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,802
You hate me, l trust,
Miss lmbrie?

125
00:10:56,876 --> 00:11:00,539
No. l can<i>'</i>t afford to hate anybody.
l<i>'</i>m only a photographer.

126
00:11:03,782 --> 00:11:05,306
Ask him to wait.

127
00:11:06,552 --> 00:11:09,817
Your assignment will be Spy<i>'</i>s
most sensational achievement:

128
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:12,187
Tracy Lord.

129
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:15,284
Big game hunting in Africa,
fox hunting in Pennsylvania...

130
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:17,795
married on impulse
and divorced in a rage...

131
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:21,026
and always unapproachable
by the press.

132
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,261
"'The Unapproachable Miss Lord."'

133
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:26,634
"'The Philadelphia Story."'

134
00:11:26,705 --> 00:11:30,505
"'Closed were the portals
of snobbish fox hunting."' No.

135
00:11:30,576 --> 00:11:33,272
"'No hunter of foxes
is Spy magazine."'

136
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:35,973
Anyway, presented for
the first time, quote:

137
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:39,848
"'A wedding day
inside mainline society."'

138
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,855
"'Or what the kitchen maid saw
through the keyhole."' Unquote.

139
00:11:43,923 --> 00:11:46,289
Writing<i>'</i>s your job.
l<i>'</i>m only the publisher.

140
00:11:46,358 --> 00:11:49,020
All right, publisher,
take this. Quote:

141
00:11:49,094 --> 00:11:53,087
"'No hunter of buckshot in the rear
is cagey, crafty Connor."'

142
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:55,793
Unquote. Close paragraph.

143
00:11:55,868 --> 00:11:58,530
Close job.
Close bank account.

144
00:11:59,872 --> 00:12:03,273
But how can we possibly get inside
the Lord estate, let alone the house?

145
00:12:03,342 --> 00:12:05,708
We<i>'</i>re not gonna do it,
doggone it!

146
00:12:05,778 --> 00:12:07,712
lt<i>'</i>s degrading!
lt<i>'</i>s undignified!

147
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,112
So is an empty stomach.
How do we get in?

148
00:12:14,954 --> 00:12:17,149
Ask the gentleman to come in.

149
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:30,293
-l understand we understand each other.
-Quite.

150
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:33,304
This gentleman has been employed
in our Buenos Aires office.

151
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:35,670
Fortunately, he came up
yesterday on the clipper...

152
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:38,471
and l believe he can
help us with our problem.

153
00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:39,806
How?

154
00:12:39,878 --> 00:12:43,245
Tracy Lord<i>'</i>s brother Junius is
in the American embassy down there...

155
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:45,977
and he<i>'</i>s an old friend
of this gentleman<i>'</i>s.

156
00:12:46,051 --> 00:12:49,350
He<i>'</i>ll introduce you to the Lords
as intimate friends of Junius.

157
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:51,082
Dear old Junius.

158
00:12:51,156 --> 00:12:54,057
This Tracy Lord,
does she know you?

159
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:56,492
You might say Miss Lord and l
grew up together.

160
00:12:56,562 --> 00:12:59,793
You might also say
you were her first husband.

161
00:12:59,865 --> 00:13:01,127
Yes, you might.

162
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,725
Holy mackerel.
What goes on here?

163
00:13:03,802 --> 00:13:07,670
l remember your honeymoon very well,
you and she on a little sailboat.

164
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,039
-The True Love, wasn<i>'</i>t it?
-How did you know?

165
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,045
l was the only photographer
whose camera you didn<i>'</i>t smash.

166
00:13:14,113 --> 00:13:17,571
You were terribly nice about it.
You threw it in the ocean.

167
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,550
One of those, huh?

168
00:13:19,618 --> 00:13:22,712
Yes, l had the strange idea
our honeymoon was our own business.

169
00:13:22,788 --> 00:13:27,248
lncidentally, he paid for the cameras.
l got a nice letter of apology too.

170
00:13:27,326 --> 00:13:28,987
Always the gentleman, huh?

171
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:30,926
Except on occasion.

172
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:32,930
Now, what are the plans?

173
00:13:32,998 --> 00:13:35,694
The wedding<i>'</i>s Saturday.
Today is Thursday.

174
00:13:35,768 --> 00:13:38,202
They should spend tomorrow night
as guests of the Lords.

175
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,261
There<i>'</i>s somethin<i>'</i> screwy here.

176
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:44,435
lf you<i>'</i>ve resigned, why are you
doin<i>'</i> all this unless you--

177
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:49,477
You wanna get even
with your ex-bride, huh?

178
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,486
l<i>'</i>ll have a car pick them up
at noon tomorrow in north Philadelphia.

179
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:02,690
Mike, there<i>'</i>s spit in your eye.
lt shows.

180
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:22,670
Maybe they<i>'</i>d rather we go around
to the servants<i>'</i> entrance.

181
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:25,012
Maybe this is
the servants<i>'</i> entrance.

182
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:36,824
-Good morning, Edward.
-Why, Mr. Haven!

183
00:14:36,895 --> 00:14:40,331
ls Mrs. Haven--l mean,
Miss Tracy or her mother in?

184
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,199
They may be at the swimming pool, sir.
Shall l announce you?

185
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:46,965
No. l<i>'</i>ll go around myself
and surprise them.

186
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,507
lt will indeed
be a surprise, sir.

187
00:14:49,575 --> 00:14:52,373
These are friends of Mr. Junius<i>'</i>s.
Have them wait in the south parlor.

188
00:14:52,444 --> 00:14:54,036
Certainly, Mr. Haven.

189
00:15:03,622 --> 00:15:05,214
Excuse me, sir.

190
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:11,719
The south parlor?

191
00:15:11,797 --> 00:15:13,890
Miss lmbrie, the south parlor.

192
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:18,634
The queen will have bread and honey
at the usual time.

193
00:15:25,778 --> 00:15:28,770
Seems a little cold
for the south parlor.

194
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:33,245
l<i>'</i>d rather expected to find
pickaninnies and banjos.

195
00:15:37,756 --> 00:15:40,782
What<i>'</i>s this room?
l forgot my compass.

196
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,293
This would be south-southwest
parlor by living room.

197
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:51,029
Knickknacks, gimcracks,
signed photographs.

198
00:15:51,103 --> 00:15:54,334
You<i>'</i>d have to be as rich as the Lords
to live in a dump like this.

199
00:15:54,406 --> 00:15:57,341
-l wouldn<i>'</i>t live in it if they paid me.
-They won<i>'</i>t.

200
00:16:08,053 --> 00:16:10,715
Looks like they run
a hockshop on the side.

201
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,813
Just lookin<i>'</i> around.

202
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:01,435
l<i>'</i>ll want your fingerprints for this.

203
00:17:04,443 --> 00:17:08,311
Hey, what<i>'</i>s this--
What<i>'</i>s this guy Haven up to?

204
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,109
C.K. Dexter Haven.

205
00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:13,948
What kind of a name is that?
C.K. Dexter Haven.

206
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:16,613
Macaulay Connor<i>'</i>s
no homespun tag, my pet.

207
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:19,316
Yeah, you just try
callin<i>'</i> me Macaulay.

208
00:17:19,391 --> 00:17:21,154
l knew a plain Joe Smith once.

209
00:17:21,226 --> 00:17:24,992
He was only a clerk in a hardware store,
but he was an absolute rat.

210
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,863
C.K. Dexter Haven.

211
00:17:29,935 --> 00:17:34,065
He plays polo, he designs
sailboats, "'class"' boats.

212
00:17:34,139 --> 00:17:36,767
-Very upper class.
-Don<i>'</i>t despair.

213
00:17:36,842 --> 00:17:39,208
He<i>'</i>s out. Kittredge,
man of the people, is in.

214
00:17:39,278 --> 00:17:42,338
Quite a comer too, l understand.
Political timber.

215
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:44,507
Poor guy. l wonder
how he fell for it.

216
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,950
Uh-oh, Liz. What did l tell you?
How do you like this?

217
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,786
"'Living room, sitting room,
terrace, pool, stables."'

218
00:17:51,857 --> 00:17:54,792
That<i>'</i>s so they can talk to the horses
without having them in the house.

219
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:57,294
Don<i>'</i>t, Mike!

220
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:04,901
Yes?

221
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,699
This is the bridal suite.

222
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:09,400
Send up some caviar sandwiches
and a bottle of beer.

223
00:18:09,474 --> 00:18:11,237
What? Who is this?

224
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,040
This is the voice of doom calling.

225
00:18:14,112 --> 00:18:17,946
Your days are numbered,
to the seventh son of the seventh son!

226
00:18:21,153 --> 00:18:24,020
-Hello? Hello?
-What<i>'</i>s the matter?

227
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:26,592
One of the servants
has been at the sherry again.

228
00:18:29,928 --> 00:18:33,455
-Dexter, you<i>'</i>ve come back!
-Ah, Dinah, my dream girl!

229
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:35,466
What in the name of--

230
00:18:36,868 --> 00:18:40,531
No, it can<i>'</i>t be. He went to
South America for two years.

231
00:18:40,606 --> 00:18:43,268
Edward said they were
at the swimming pool.

232
00:18:43,342 --> 00:18:44,775
They seem to be here.

233
00:18:48,347 --> 00:18:51,839
Dexter, don<i>'</i>t you know
that tomorrow is the wedding?

234
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:53,942
Oh, that<i>'</i>s right.
So it is.

235
00:18:55,253 --> 00:18:58,552
You can go right back
where you came from!

236
00:18:58,624 --> 00:19:01,058
Can<i>'</i>t. Dinah says it<i>'</i>s
awful here without me.

237
00:19:01,126 --> 00:19:03,219
Hello, you sweet thing.

238
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,490
Red, you look in the pink.

239
00:19:06,765 --> 00:19:09,199
You don<i>'</i>t think l<i>'</i>d miss
your wedding, do you?

240
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:12,668
-Dexter, you wouldn<i>'</i>t.
-l<i>'</i>m not so sure he wouldn<i>'</i>t.

241
00:19:12,738 --> 00:19:15,707
No, Mother Lord, l wouldn<i>'</i>t.
l assure you l wouldn<i>'</i>t.

242
00:19:15,774 --> 00:19:18,368
-Tell us all about Junius.
-Stay <i>'</i>til lunch.

243
00:19:18,443 --> 00:19:22,470
Don<i>'</i>t open your house. Stay here.
We<i>'</i>re having no guests over the wedding.

244
00:19:24,216 --> 00:19:26,810
-How about the groom?
-He<i>'</i>s staying at the gatehouse.

245
00:19:26,885 --> 00:19:28,216
Oh, that<i>'</i>s good.

246
00:19:28,286 --> 00:19:30,516
-Junius is fine.
-He should be here.

247
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:33,251
He<i>'</i>s heartbroken. l suggested
representing him as best man--

248
00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:37,125
l<i>'</i>m afraid that George might prefer
to have his best man sober.

249
00:19:37,195 --> 00:19:38,856
l wish you<i>'</i>d represent George.

250
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:42,331
That<i>'</i>s my loyal little girl.
You<i>'</i>ll like the people Junius did send.

251
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:45,427
You haven<i>'</i>t switched from liquor
to dope, by any chance?

252
00:19:45,504 --> 00:19:47,802
-You see?
-The people Junius did send?

253
00:19:47,873 --> 00:19:50,774
You don<i>'</i>t know a Macaulay Connor
or Elizabeth lmbrie, do you?

254
00:19:50,842 --> 00:19:53,436
-We can finish these later.
-l<i>'</i>d better introduce you.

255
00:19:53,512 --> 00:19:57,414
Call me for--
lntroduce me to whom?

256
00:19:57,482 --> 00:20:00,451
To Miss lmbrie and Mr. Connor,
to tell them which rooms they<i>'</i>d have.

257
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:04,353
Mr. Connor is asking if he should wear
a black or white tie to tonight<i>'</i>s party.

258
00:20:04,423 --> 00:20:07,984
-Rooms?
-l<i>'</i>d better start from the beginning.

259
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,722
Sit down, dear.
They<i>'</i>re great friends of Junius<i>'</i>s.

260
00:20:10,796 --> 00:20:13,993
And they expect to stay here?
l think that<i>'</i>s very queer.

261
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:16,899
l think it<i>'</i>s queerer than that.
l think it<i>'</i>s paranoiac.

262
00:20:16,968 --> 00:20:20,404
You see, it was Junius<i>'</i>s idea.
They<i>'</i>ve been very kind to him, and--

263
00:20:20,472 --> 00:20:23,339
You<i>'</i>re lying, Dexter.
l can always tell.

264
00:20:23,408 --> 00:20:25,342
-Can you, Red?
-They<i>'</i>re Junius<i>'</i>s friends.

265
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,878
You went to work after
the divorce, didn<i>'</i>t you?

266
00:20:27,946 --> 00:20:30,744
Yes, except for a brief interlude
in some alcoholic sanitariums.

267
00:20:30,816 --> 00:20:33,011
You took a job
in South America. Who for?

268
00:20:33,085 --> 00:20:35,781
-A magazine.
-lt wasn<i>'</i>t Spy magazine?

269
00:20:35,854 --> 00:20:37,583
You are a mass of intuition.

270
00:20:37,656 --> 00:20:40,784
l don<i>'</i>t suppose that Junius<i>'</i>s
friends are photographers?

271
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:43,350
-l thought you were low, but l never--
-What are you going to do?

272
00:20:43,428 --> 00:20:46,363
-After l<i>'</i>ve telephoned Junius--
-Wait, Red.

273
00:20:46,431 --> 00:20:48,422
Don<i>'</i>t telephone Junius.
l<i>'</i>ll confess.

274
00:20:54,206 --> 00:20:56,401
No. You<i>'</i>re slipping, Red.

275
00:20:56,475 --> 00:21:00,434
l used to be afraid of that look,
the withering glance of the goddess.

276
00:21:00,512 --> 00:21:03,072
l didn<i>'</i>t think that alcohol would--
Oh, shut up.

277
00:21:05,817 --> 00:21:07,148
Dinah, stay here.

278
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:09,779
Please, Mother.
Maybe he<i>'</i>s going to sock her.

279
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:13,814
Don<i>'</i>t say "'sock,"' darling.
"'Strike"' is quite an ugly enough word.

280
00:21:15,527 --> 00:21:17,961
Who do they think they are,
barging in on peaceful people?

281
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:21,760
-They<i>'</i>ll think you don<i>'</i>t want them.
-l want them out, and you too!

282
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:25,462
Yes, your majesty. But first could l
interest you in some small blackmail?

283
00:21:26,972 --> 00:21:30,738
lt<i>'</i>s an article, complete with
snapshots, details and insinuations...

284
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:33,243
and it<i>'</i>s ready for
publication in Spy...

285
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:35,779
and it<i>'</i>s about your father
and that dancer in New York.

286
00:21:35,847 --> 00:21:37,815
About Father and Tina Mara?

287
00:21:37,883 --> 00:21:40,215
Quiet. Dinah.

288
00:21:40,285 --> 00:21:43,618
But they can<i>'</i>t,
even if it<i>'</i>s true.

289
00:21:44,923 --> 00:21:47,721
-Where do you get these?
-From Sidney Kidd, editor and publisher.

290
00:21:47,793 --> 00:21:51,422
-He<i>'</i>s got to be stopped.
-He is, temporarily.

291
00:21:51,496 --> 00:21:54,932
That is, if you<i>'</i>ll allow those two
to turn in the story on your wedding.

292
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,026
And when Kidd says a story,
he means a story.

293
00:21:58,103 --> 00:21:59,866
-l<i>'</i>m gonna be sick.
-Yes, dear.

294
00:21:59,938 --> 00:22:02,668
"'An lntimate Day
With a Society Bride."'

295
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:04,174
l am sick.

296
00:22:05,177 --> 00:22:07,236
lt<i>'</i>s tough, but that<i>'</i>s
the way it seems to be.

297
00:22:07,312 --> 00:22:10,213
So l<i>'</i>m to be examined, undressed
and generally humiliated...

298
00:22:10,282 --> 00:22:12,250
at 15 cents a copy.

299
00:22:12,317 --> 00:22:15,343
And you, you--
You<i>'</i>re loving it.

300
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,944
Am l, Red?

301
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:24,160
Mother, we<i>'</i>re hooked.

302
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:26,629
-Are they really reporters?
-Not even friends of Junius<i>'</i>s?

303
00:22:26,698 --> 00:22:29,326
They aren<i>'</i>t anybody<i>'</i>s friends,
but we<i>'</i>re to pretend they are.

304
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:30,891
-But why?
-Don<i>'</i>t ask me.

305
00:22:30,969 --> 00:22:33,529
There<i>'</i>s a good reason,
and it<i>'</i>s my wedding, so please!

306
00:22:33,605 --> 00:22:36,199
l<i>'</i>ll bet it<i>'</i>s on account
of Father and that dancer.

307
00:22:36,274 --> 00:22:38,765
-Dinah, what do you know?
-l listen around.

308
00:22:38,844 --> 00:22:41,369
ls there no such thing
as privacy anymore?

309
00:22:41,446 --> 00:22:43,914
Only in bed, Mother,
and not always there.

310
00:22:43,982 --> 00:22:46,246
Watching every little mannerism...

311
00:22:46,318 --> 00:22:48,980
jotting down notes on how we sit,
stand, talk, eat and move!

312
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:52,922
-Will they do that?
-All in that horrible, snide English.

313
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:56,154
lf we have to submit to it
to save Father<i>'</i>s face--

314
00:22:56,228 --> 00:22:58,287
which, incidentally,
doesn<i>'</i>t deserve it--

315
00:22:58,363 --> 00:23:01,696
l<i>'</i>ll give them a picture of home life
that<i>'</i>ll stand their hair on end!

316
00:23:03,068 --> 00:23:06,731
Tracy, we must just be ourselves,
very much ourselves.

317
00:23:06,805 --> 00:23:09,603
But you want us to create
a good impression, don<i>'</i>t you?

318
00:23:09,674 --> 00:23:12,006
They don<i>'</i>t know that we know
what they<i>'</i>re here for?

319
00:23:12,077 --> 00:23:14,443
No. That was understood.
The girl<i>'</i>s quite nice.

320
00:23:14,512 --> 00:23:16,844
He writes short stories.
Very down to earth.

321
00:23:16,915 --> 00:23:19,816
-They<i>'</i>ll love us.
-Oh, dear, you<i>'</i>d both better dress.

322
00:23:19,885 --> 00:23:23,946
And both of you, promise to behave
like ladies in front of these creatures.

323
00:23:24,022 --> 00:23:27,480
We<i>'</i>ll do our best, Mrs. Lord.
l don<i>'</i>t know how good that is.

324
00:23:32,163 --> 00:23:35,462
Dexter, how perfectly dreadful.

325
00:23:35,533 --> 00:23:38,969
What<i>'</i>ll they say about Seth not being
here for his own daughter<i>'</i>s wedding?

326
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,273
l know, dear.

327
00:23:46,611 --> 00:23:50,604
You<i>'</i>d better go and tell them how
terribly happy we are to have them.

328
00:23:50,682 --> 00:23:53,207
That<i>'</i>s the old Quaker spirit,
Mother Lord.

329
00:23:53,285 --> 00:23:54,877
Keep swinging.

330
00:24:01,993 --> 00:24:04,553
Oh. l thought it was that butler.

331
00:24:04,629 --> 00:24:06,722
The family will be down
to welcome you.

332
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:08,789
-What with?
-With open arms.

333
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:11,529
They<i>'</i>re terribly happy to have
any friends of Junius<i>'</i>s here.

334
00:24:11,603 --> 00:24:13,696
-Do they know about us?
-Why should they?

335
00:24:13,772 --> 00:24:18,106
Look, Haven, our research department
didn<i>'</i>t give us much data.

336
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:22,203
This fiance of this girl,
George Kittredge, age 32?

337
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,441
-You know him very well?
-Well enough.

338
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:28,816
"'General manager of Quaker State Coal,
company owned by Seth Lord."'

339
00:24:28,887 --> 00:24:31,617
-That<i>'</i>s the girl<i>'</i>s father, huh?
-What a coincidence.

340
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,453
How<i>'</i>d he meet her?

341
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:35,959
Heaven brought them together,
l imagine.

342
00:24:37,629 --> 00:24:39,062
"'Seth Lord.

343
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:42,122
"'See Banker<i>'</i>s Annual,
Directory of Directors."'

344
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,225
-ls there a library in town?
-Yes.

345
00:24:44,302 --> 00:24:46,293
l suppose you wouldn<i>'</i>t
know where that is?

346
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:49,363
Well, roughly.
My grandfather built it.

347
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:55,038
Now, about this girl...

348
00:24:55,113 --> 00:24:57,877
"'Tracy Samantha Lord."'

349
00:24:57,949 --> 00:24:59,382
What about her?

350
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:02,011
Well, what<i>'</i>s her
leading characteristic?

351
00:25:02,087 --> 00:25:05,147
She has a horror of men
who wear their hats in the house.

352
00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:09,785
Leading characteristics
to be filled in later.

353
00:25:09,861 --> 00:25:12,227
l can fill them in right now.

354
00:25:12,297 --> 00:25:16,097
The young, rich, rapacious
American female.

355
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:18,101
No other country
where she exists.

356
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:20,763
And would l change places
with Tracy Samantha Lord...

357
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:23,364
for all her wealth and beauty?

358
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:25,807
Oh, boy, just ask me.

359
00:25:27,012 --> 00:25:30,504
Well, tell four footmen to call me
in time for lunch, will you?

360
00:25:39,057 --> 00:25:40,786
How do you do?

361
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,451
Friends of my brother Junius,
are you not?

362
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:45,826
l am Dinah Lord.

363
00:25:45,897 --> 00:25:48,195
My real name is Diana,
but my sister changed it.

364
00:25:48,266 --> 00:25:50,461
l<i>'</i>m Elizabeth lmbrie.
This is Macaulay Connor.

365
00:25:50,535 --> 00:25:54,733
Enchantee de vous voir!
Enchantee de faire votre connaissance!

366
00:25:54,806 --> 00:25:56,774
l spoke French
before l spoke English.

367
00:25:56,841 --> 00:26:00,072
My early childhood was spent in Paris
where my father worked in a bank:

368
00:26:00,145 --> 00:26:01,874
-The House of Morgan.
-Really?

369
00:26:01,946 --> 00:26:04,039
C<i>'</i>est vrai absolument!

370
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:07,812
Can you play the piano?
l can, and sing at the same time!

371
00:26:07,886 --> 00:26:09,319
Listen.

372
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,428
Lydia, oh, Lydia
Say, have you met Lydia

373
00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:24,559
Oh, Lydia
the tattooed lady

374
00:26:24,636 --> 00:26:27,469
She has eyes
that folks adore so

375
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:30,702
And a torso even more so

376
00:26:30,775 --> 00:26:33,005
What is this?

377
00:26:33,078 --> 00:26:34,511
ldiot, probably.

378
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:36,274
The queen of tattoos

379
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:39,510
On her back
is the battle of Waterloo

380
00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:42,246
Beside it the wreck
of the Hesperus too

381
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,086
And proudly above
waves the red, white

382
00:26:46,157 --> 00:26:48,022
And blue

383
00:26:48,093 --> 00:26:51,824
You can learn a lot from Lydia

384
00:26:51,896 --> 00:26:54,990
Ah, petite soeur,
tu es un veritable petit Chopin!

385
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:56,658
-Tu trouves?
-Mais certainement.

386
00:26:56,734 --> 00:26:59,760
Mais qu<i>'</i>est-ce qu<i>'</i>il y a?
Voyons, tu es pale.

387
00:26:59,838 --> 00:27:03,604
Montre-moi ta langue. J<i>'</i>espere bien
que ce n<i>'</i>est pas le smallpox.

388
00:27:03,675 --> 00:27:05,336
-Le smallpox?
-Mais oui.

389
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,344
Va dire a maman de se depecher!

390
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:15,147
Oh. How do you do?

391
00:27:16,788 --> 00:27:18,619
l<i>'</i>m Tracy Lord.

392
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,591
lt<i>'</i>s so nice having you here.
How did you leave Junius?

393
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:23,957
We left Junius fine.
That little sister of yours--

394
00:27:24,028 --> 00:27:26,155
lsn<i>'</i>t she a dear?
So talented.

395
00:27:26,231 --> 00:27:29,792
-Junius is such a lamb, isn<i>'</i>t he?
-Yes, isn<i>'</i>t he?

396
00:27:29,868 --> 00:27:34,237
lt<i>'</i>s a pity none of the male members
of the family are going to be here.

397
00:27:34,305 --> 00:27:37,399
-Where<i>'</i>s your father?
-Darling Papa.

398
00:27:37,475 --> 00:27:40,171
-l do hope you<i>'</i>ll stay for my wedding.
-We<i>'</i>d like to very much.

399
00:27:40,245 --> 00:27:43,305
-That was our idea.
-l<i>'</i>m so glad that it occurred to you.

400
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:45,941
The house is in rather
a mess, of course.

401
00:27:46,017 --> 00:27:49,976
We<i>'</i>ll all have to huddle here
and overflow onto the porch.

402
00:27:52,524 --> 00:27:55,652
-l hope your rooms are comfortable.
-Your father sick?

403
00:27:57,128 --> 00:28:00,564
-What a cunning little camera.
-l<i>'</i>m an awful nuisance with it.

404
00:28:00,632 --> 00:28:03,226
But you couldn<i>'</i>t be.
l hope you<i>'</i>ll take loads.

405
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:06,099
Dear Papa and Mama aren<i>'</i>t
allowing any reporters in.

406
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:09,868
That is, except for little Mr. Grace,
who does the social news.

407
00:28:09,941 --> 00:28:12,671
Can you imagine a grown-up man
having to sink so low?

408
00:28:12,744 --> 00:28:15,269
lt does seem kind of bad.

409
00:28:16,814 --> 00:28:19,248
You<i>'</i>re a kind of writer...

410
00:28:19,317 --> 00:28:21,911
-aren<i>'</i>t you, Mr. Connor?
-Sort of.

411
00:28:21,986 --> 00:28:23,453
-A book?
-Yes.

412
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:25,785
Under what name do you publish?

413
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:28,724
My own. Macaulay Connor.

414
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:32,496
What<i>'</i>s the Macaulay for?

415
00:28:32,564 --> 00:28:34,862
Well, my father
taught English history.

416
00:28:34,933 --> 00:28:36,992
l<i>'</i>m "'Mike"' to my friends.

417
00:28:37,068 --> 00:28:39,866
Of whom you have many, l<i>'</i>m sure.

418
00:28:39,938 --> 00:28:42,463
English history,
it<i>'</i>s always fascinated me:

419
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,134
Cromwell, Robin Hood,
Jack the Ripper.

420
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,940
Where did he teach?
l mean, your father.

421
00:28:48,012 --> 00:28:50,480
ln a little high school
in South Bend, lndiana.

422
00:28:50,548 --> 00:28:52,015
South Bend.

423
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:54,483
lt sounds like dancing,
doesn<i>'</i>t it?

424
00:28:54,552 --> 00:28:57,077
You must have had a most
happy childhood there.

425
00:28:57,155 --> 00:28:59,180
-Yeah, it was terrific.
-l<i>'</i>m so glad.

426
00:28:59,257 --> 00:29:02,192
-l didn<i>'</i>t mean it that way.
-l<i>'</i>m so sorry. Why?

427
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,229
Well, lack of wherewithal,
l guess.

428
00:29:05,296 --> 00:29:08,629
But that doesn<i>'</i>t always cause
unhappiness, does it?

429
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,361
Not if you<i>'</i>re
the right kind of man.

430
00:29:10,435 --> 00:29:13,996
George Kittredge, my fiance,
never had anything either, and he--

431
00:29:14,072 --> 00:29:15,562
Are either of you married?

432
00:29:18,643 --> 00:29:20,577
You mean you were,
but now you<i>'</i>re divorced.

433
00:29:20,645 --> 00:29:23,478
-The fact is--
-Surely you<i>'</i>re not ashamed of it.

434
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:25,914
-Of course l<i>'</i>m not.
-What?

435
00:29:25,984 --> 00:29:28,976
lt was years ago.
l was only a kid in Duluth.

436
00:29:29,053 --> 00:29:31,146
Good heavens, Liz.
You never told me.

437
00:29:31,222 --> 00:29:34,123
-You never asked me.
-l know, but you--

438
00:29:35,593 --> 00:29:37,561
Joe Smith, hardware.

439
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:42,099
You<i>'</i>re the darnedest girl, Liz.

440
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:43,599
l think l<i>'</i>m sweet.

441
00:29:45,837 --> 00:29:49,000
Duluth must be a lovely spot.
lt<i>'</i>s west of here, isn<i>'</i>t it?

442
00:29:49,073 --> 00:29:51,871
Sort of, but occasionally
we get the breezes--

443
00:29:51,943 --> 00:29:54,377
And this is your first visit
in Philadelphia.

444
00:29:54,445 --> 00:29:57,209
lt<i>'</i>s a quaint old place,
don<i>'</i>t you think? Filled with relics.

445
00:29:57,282 --> 00:29:59,273
And how old are you, Mr. Connor?

446
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,476
Thirty.

447
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:02,485
One book isn<i>'</i>t much
for a man of 30.

448
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:03,952
l don<i>'</i>t mean to criticize.

449
00:30:04,022 --> 00:30:06,422
You probably have other interests
outside your work.

450
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:07,958
None.

451
00:30:08,026 --> 00:30:09,584
l mean us.

452
00:30:10,795 --> 00:30:12,160
How sweet.

453
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,721
Are you going together?

454
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:19,767
-l beg your pardon?
-That is an odd question.

455
00:30:19,837 --> 00:30:23,204
l don<i>'</i>t see why.
l think it<i>'</i>s very interesting.

456
00:30:24,475 --> 00:30:26,670
Miss lmbrie, don<i>'</i>t you agree...

457
00:30:26,744 --> 00:30:29,440
that if a man says he loves a girl,
he ought to marry her?

458
00:30:29,514 --> 00:30:30,879
Can she be human?

459
00:30:30,948 --> 00:30:33,576
Please, Mr. Connor.
l asked Miss lmbrie a question.

460
00:30:33,651 --> 00:30:35,209
Well, that depends. l--

461
00:30:35,286 --> 00:30:36,878
l<i>'</i>ll see what<i>'</i>s keeping Mama.

462
00:30:46,998 --> 00:30:49,398
Who<i>'</i>s doing the interviewing here?

463
00:30:50,535 --> 00:30:53,629
-You don<i>'</i>t suppose she caught on?
-No, she was born that way.

464
00:30:53,705 --> 00:30:56,071
-Don<i>'</i>t let her throw ya.
-Do you want to take over?

465
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,337
-l wanna go home.
-Ah, here you are.

466
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,810
How do you do?
We<i>'</i>re so happy to have you.

467
00:31:01,879 --> 00:31:05,474
Forgive me for not coming in sooner,
but things are in such a state.

468
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,983
My little girl.

469
00:31:08,086 --> 00:31:09,781
She<i>'</i>s going to leave me.

470
00:31:09,854 --> 00:31:13,847
Aren<i>'</i>t you pretty, my dear.
But then Junius<i>'</i>s friends always are.

471
00:31:13,925 --> 00:31:16,325
Look at the way
she wears her hair, Tracy.

472
00:31:16,394 --> 00:31:19,022
-lsn<i>'</i>t it pretty?
-Mighty fine.

473
00:31:21,466 --> 00:31:23,400
Shall we have sherry on the porch?

474
00:31:29,941 --> 00:31:33,069
-This is my youngest daughter, Diana.
-l think we<i>'</i>ve met.

475
00:31:33,144 --> 00:31:36,238
l wish my husband could be here.
We expect him presently.

476
00:31:36,314 --> 00:31:40,080
He<i>'</i>s detained in New York on business
for that lovely dancer, Tina Mara.

477
00:31:40,151 --> 00:31:42,415
-Do you know her work?
-Not professionally.

478
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:44,478
So talented,
and such a lovely person...

479
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:47,149
but like so many artists,
no business head.

480
00:31:47,225 --> 00:31:48,522
None whatever.

481
00:31:48,593 --> 00:31:51,528
l have some lovely presents,
don<i>'</i>t you think so, Mr. Connor?

482
00:32:01,773 --> 00:32:03,070
Hello, everybody.

483
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,910
-l hope l<i>'</i>m not late.
-You<i>'</i>re never late, George.

484
00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:13,212
We have a lovely surprise. Junius has
sent these people as a wedding present.

485
00:32:13,284 --> 00:32:16,048
Mr. Kittredge,
this is Miss--l<i>'</i>m so sorry.

486
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,281
-lmbrie.
-Any friend of Junius<i>'</i>s is my friend.

487
00:32:18,356 --> 00:32:20,290
And, uh, Mr. Morrow?

488
00:32:20,358 --> 00:32:22,223
-l didn<i>'</i>t get the name.
-Connor.

489
00:32:22,293 --> 00:32:24,488
Macauley Connor.

490
00:32:24,562 --> 00:32:25,551
He<i>'</i>s a writer.

491
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,995
Don<i>'</i>t apologize, Mrs. Lord.

492
00:32:27,064 --> 00:32:29,430
No apology necessary.
l have great respect for writers.

493
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,525
Well, thank you.
Any kind word is--

494
00:32:31,602 --> 00:32:34,070
-How are you?
-Much better now that you<i>'</i>re here.

495
00:32:34,138 --> 00:32:36,368
Oh, l guess this
must be love, huh?

496
00:32:36,441 --> 00:32:39,774
-Your guess is correct.
-l<i>'</i>m just his faithful old dog Tray.

497
00:32:39,844 --> 00:32:42,244
-Give me your paw.
-You<i>'</i>ve got it.

498
00:32:43,247 --> 00:32:44,737
How sweet.

499
00:32:45,817 --> 00:32:47,808
Say, l<i>'</i>d like to see
one of those, Miss lmbrie.

500
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:49,113
You will.

501
00:32:49,187 --> 00:32:50,779
Shall we have some sherry?

502
00:32:50,855 --> 00:32:54,120
l suppose Junius has told you
all about our happy little family.

503
00:32:54,192 --> 00:32:56,752
-Papa!
-What?

504
00:32:58,262 --> 00:33:00,822
Dear Papa.

505
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:05,702
You angel to get here
in time for lunch!

506
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:08,034
-lsn<i>'</i>t he, Mama?
-lndeed he is, but--

507
00:33:08,105 --> 00:33:10,539
Father, these are our friends,
Miss lmbrie and Mr. Connor.

508
00:33:10,608 --> 00:33:14,669
-How are you, Mr. Lord?
-Oh, just fine, thank you.

509
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:16,679
-How are you?
-How do you do?

510
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:18,044
How do you do?

511
00:33:18,115 --> 00:33:19,514
Howdy, Pops.

512
00:33:19,584 --> 00:33:21,176
Oh, dear Dinah.

513
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,048
-Father, here<i>'</i>s George.
-How are you, Kittredge?

514
00:33:25,122 --> 00:33:26,453
Margaret, my sweet.

515
00:33:26,524 --> 00:33:29,618
-Another place for luncheon, Edward.
-Very good, madam.

516
00:33:30,595 --> 00:33:33,428
Well--here l am...

517
00:33:33,498 --> 00:33:35,432
in the bosom of my--

518
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,764
-Hello, friends and enemies.
-Young man!

519
00:33:39,403 --> 00:33:41,166
-Remove yourself.
-How are you, sir?

520
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:43,571
l don<i>'</i>t know. Get along.

521
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:45,575
Darling, l<i>'</i>ve changed my mind.
l will stay for lunch.

522
00:33:45,643 --> 00:33:47,270
Another place, Edward.

523
00:33:47,345 --> 00:33:49,711
-Hello, Kittredge.
-How are you, Haven?

524
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,407
Just Damon and Pythias.

525
00:33:51,482 --> 00:33:53,780
No, Grant and Lee.

526
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:03,526
You don<i>'</i>t look as well as when
l last saw you, Kittredge.

527
00:34:03,594 --> 00:34:06,529
Oh, you poor fellow.
l know just how you feel.

528
00:34:07,765 --> 00:34:10,233
-How<i>'</i>s it coming?
-Beautifully, Dexter.

529
00:34:10,301 --> 00:34:13,998
We<i>'</i>re so indebted to you
for these lovely people.

530
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:16,539
lt<i>'</i>s almost impossible
to repay that debt.

531
00:34:16,607 --> 00:34:18,541
But you<i>'</i>ll manage, eh, Red?

532
00:34:20,244 --> 00:34:23,441
-They grew up together, you know.
-How nice.

533
00:34:23,514 --> 00:34:25,539
You don<i>'</i>t look old enough
to get married...

534
00:34:25,616 --> 00:34:27,675
not even the first time,
but then you never did.

535
00:34:27,752 --> 00:34:30,619
She needs trouble to mature her,
Kittredge. Give her lots of it.

536
00:34:30,688 --> 00:34:32,849
l<i>'</i>m afraid she can<i>'</i>t
count on me for that.

537
00:34:32,924 --> 00:34:34,789
No? That<i>'</i>s too bad.

538
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:37,623
For your own sake, Red,
you should have stuck to me longer.

539
00:34:37,695 --> 00:34:40,926
l thought it was for life, but the nice
judge gave me a full pardon.

540
00:34:40,998 --> 00:34:44,161
Ah, that<i>'</i>s the old redhead.
No bitterness, no recrimination.

541
00:34:44,235 --> 00:34:46,430
Just a good swift left to the jaw.

542
00:34:50,408 --> 00:34:52,535
They grew up together.

543
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:56,513
Luncheon is served, madam.

544
00:34:56,581 --> 00:34:59,744
Oh, thank you, Edward. Come sit.
We have so much to talk about.

545
00:34:59,817 --> 00:35:04,550
l don<i>'</i>t suppose a man ever had
a better or finer family.

546
00:35:04,622 --> 00:35:06,715
l often wake up in the night
and say to myself...

547
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:10,227
"'Seth, you lucky dog,
what have you done to deserve it all?"'

548
00:35:10,294 --> 00:35:11,784
And what have you?

549
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:18,032
Oh, thank you.

550
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:24,033
Oh, how stupid of me!

551
00:35:24,976 --> 00:35:27,774
Oh, dear! How awful!

552
00:35:27,845 --> 00:35:29,779
l had a feeling
that would happen.

553
00:35:29,847 --> 00:35:33,442
Your camera.
l<i>'</i>m so, so sorry.

554
00:35:33,517 --> 00:35:35,007
l<i>'</i>m sure you are.

555
00:35:41,225 --> 00:35:42,658
What is it?

556
00:35:42,727 --> 00:35:43,887
Your father.

557
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,292
Uncle Willie!

558
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:53,229
-Uncle Willie, how nice.
-l beg your pardon.

559
00:35:53,304 --> 00:35:56,535
Please go on into lunch, everyone.
l want a word with Uncle Willie.

560
00:35:56,607 --> 00:35:59,576
-Another place, Edward.
-Yes, madam.

561
00:36:05,383 --> 00:36:07,146
l<i>'</i>m afraid l don<i>'</i>t understand.

562
00:36:07,218 --> 00:36:10,085
You never have, but you
came anyway, didn<i>'</i>t you?

563
00:36:10,154 --> 00:36:14,750
Oh. Still Justice with her
shining sword, eh, daughter?

564
00:36:14,825 --> 00:36:17,794
-Who<i>'</i>s on the spot?
-We are, thanks to you...

565
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:19,295
Uncle Willie.

566
00:36:25,703 --> 00:36:27,466
How long will you be researching?

567
00:36:27,538 --> 00:36:30,837
Not long if l can find the right books--
his family history and stuff like that.

568
00:36:30,908 --> 00:36:33,103
There<i>'</i>s a cousin Joanna
that<i>'</i>s definitely crazy.

569
00:36:33,177 --> 00:36:34,474
-Who told you?
-Dinah.

570
00:36:34,545 --> 00:36:37,139
-Dinah should know.
-Come across the street when you finish.

571
00:36:37,214 --> 00:36:38,977
-Miss Hobson<i>'</i>s establishment.
-Okay.

572
00:37:06,877 --> 00:37:08,310
What does thee wish?

573
00:37:08,379 --> 00:37:10,347
l<i>'</i>m looking for some local b--

574
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:15,886
-What<i>'</i>d you say?
-What does thee wish?

575
00:37:17,688 --> 00:37:20,919
Um, local biography or history.

576
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:23,755
lf thee will, consult with
my colleague in there.

577
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,293
Dost thou have a washroom?

578
00:37:33,237 --> 00:37:34,499
Thank thee.

579
00:37:55,493 --> 00:37:58,394
l know this is a public library,
but l wou--

580
00:37:58,462 --> 00:38:00,521
-Hello.
-Hello.

581
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,632
Couldn<i>'</i>t you afford
to buy my book?

582
00:38:05,703 --> 00:38:07,398
The bookstore didn<i>'</i>t have one.

583
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:09,598
Are you sure you<i>'</i>re doing
the right thing?

584
00:38:09,673 --> 00:38:12,369
You know what happens to girls like you
when they read books like mine.

585
00:38:12,443 --> 00:38:14,843
They begin to think.
That<i>'</i>s bad.

586
00:38:14,912 --> 00:38:17,039
These stories are beautiful.

587
00:38:17,114 --> 00:38:19,139
Why, Connor,
they<i>'</i>re almost poetry.

588
00:38:20,317 --> 00:38:23,047
Don<i>'</i>t kid yourself. They are.

589
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,588
l can<i>'</i>t make you out at all now.

590
00:38:25,656 --> 00:38:28,784
Really?
l thought l was easy.

591
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:32,090
So did l, but you<i>'</i>re not.

592
00:38:33,798 --> 00:38:37,325
You talk so big and tough,
and then you write like this.

593
00:38:38,435 --> 00:38:39,902
Which is which?

594
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:43,334
Both, l guess.

595
00:38:45,309 --> 00:38:49,439
No, l believe you put the toughness on
to save your skin.

596
00:38:50,848 --> 00:38:52,782
You think so?

597
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,784
l know a little about that.

598
00:38:55,653 --> 00:38:57,985
-Do you?
-Quite a lot.

599
00:39:02,026 --> 00:39:03,960
Let<i>'</i>s get out of here.

600
00:39:11,535 --> 00:39:16,029
This book was just such
a complete surprise to me.

601
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:18,939
l--let<i>'</i>s walk, shall we?
lt<i>'</i>ll be much more fun.

602
00:39:19,009 --> 00:39:21,477
Take this. Tell Mr. Kittredge
we<i>'</i>ll meet him at the pool.

603
00:39:21,545 --> 00:39:22,978
Yes, Miss Tracy.

604
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:29,947
The story called, "'With The Rich
and Mighty,"' l think l liked it best.

605
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,921
l got it from
a Spanish peasant<i>'</i>s proverb.

606
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:35,618
"'With the rich and mighty,
always a little patience."'

607
00:39:35,693 --> 00:39:36,990
l like that.

608
00:39:40,197 --> 00:39:42,290
What<i>'</i>s the matter?
A little too rough?

609
00:39:42,366 --> 00:39:43,799
A little...

610
00:39:43,868 --> 00:39:45,631
but l<i>'</i>m used to it.

611
00:39:47,872 --> 00:39:49,669
Tell me something, will you?

612
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,767
When you can do a thing like that book,
how can you possibly do anything else?

613
00:39:53,844 --> 00:39:58,110
You may not believe this, but there
are people that must earn their living.

614
00:39:58,182 --> 00:40:00,514
Of course, but people
buy books, don<i>'</i>t they?

615
00:40:00,584 --> 00:40:02,518
Not as long as there<i>'</i>s
a library around.

616
00:40:03,854 --> 00:40:06,948
That book of mine represents
two solid years<i>'</i> work...

617
00:40:07,024 --> 00:40:10,721
and it netted Connor
something under $600.

618
00:40:10,794 --> 00:40:14,230
-But that shouldn<i>'</i>t be.
-Unhappily it is.

619
00:40:14,298 --> 00:40:16,766
This is beautiful country around here.
What is it all, anyway?

620
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:20,326
Part of our place.
What about your Miss lmbrie?

621
00:40:20,404 --> 00:40:22,565
Well, Miss lmbrie<i>'</i>s
in somewhat the same fix.

622
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,938
She<i>'</i>s a born painter and might be
a very important one...

623
00:40:25,009 --> 00:40:28,740
but Miss lmbrie must eat, and she also
prefers a roof over her head...

624
00:40:28,812 --> 00:40:31,838
to being constantly out
in the rain and snow.

625
00:40:31,916 --> 00:40:33,349
Food and a roof.

626
00:40:35,986 --> 00:40:38,614
You<i>'</i>ve really got something here.

627
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:40,316
-Where?
-All this.

628
00:40:41,558 --> 00:40:44,026
Oh. Come on.
The dressing rooms are over here.

629
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:48,455
l think you<i>'</i>ll find
everything you need.

630
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:54,735
Use any old one, but l think you<i>'</i>ll find
most of the junk in there.

631
00:40:54,805 --> 00:40:56,864
-Yell if you need anything.
-Okay.

632
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:15,883
l have an idea.

633
00:41:17,294 --> 00:41:20,024
l have the most wonderful
little house in Uniondale.

634
00:41:20,931 --> 00:41:24,628
lt<i>'</i>s up on a hill with a view
that would knock you silly.

635
00:41:24,702 --> 00:41:26,795
l<i>'</i>m never there except
in the hunting season...

636
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:30,033
and not much then,
and l<i>'</i>d be so happy to know...

637
00:41:30,107 --> 00:41:32,667
that it was of some real use
to someone.

638
00:41:35,713 --> 00:41:37,704
-Can you hear me?
-Yeah.

639
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:41,710
There<i>'</i>s a brook and a small lake--

640
00:41:41,785 --> 00:41:43,548
no size, really--

641
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,612
and a patch of woods,
and in any kind of weather...

642
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,954
it<i>'</i>s the most wonderful--

643
00:41:49,026 --> 00:41:53,019
Well, anyhow, l<i>'</i>m so delighted
that l can offer it to you.

644
00:41:54,164 --> 00:41:56,894
Well, it<i>'</i>s terribly nice of you,
but, uh--

645
00:41:59,837 --> 00:42:00,997
Heck, that<i>'</i>s Dexter.

646
00:42:02,539 --> 00:42:05,838
Look, if he comes here,
stand by, will you?

647
00:42:05,909 --> 00:42:08,400
-l don<i>'</i>t want to be alone with him.
-Certainly, if you like.

648
00:42:08,479 --> 00:42:11,346
lsn<i>'</i>t it lucky that l happened
to think about that house?

649
00:42:11,415 --> 00:42:14,407
And don<i>'</i>t think l<i>'</i>d come trooping in
every minute, because l wouldn<i>'</i>t.

650
00:42:14,485 --> 00:42:17,283
l<i>'</i>d never come
except when expressly asked to.

651
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:21,051
-Well, it isn<i>'</i>t that.
-What is it?

652
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:23,059
Well, you see,
the idea of artists...

653
00:42:23,127 --> 00:42:27,120
depending upon a patron lady bountiful
has more or less gone out.

654
00:42:28,432 --> 00:42:31,492
Oh. l see.

655
00:42:33,103 --> 00:42:37,437
That wasn<i>'</i>t especially kind
of you, Mr. Connor.

656
00:42:37,508 --> 00:42:39,908
l<i>'</i>m sorry to have seemed patronizing.

657
00:42:39,977 --> 00:42:42,138
-Now, look, l didn<i>'</i>t mean--
-Please don<i>'</i>t bother.

658
00:42:48,352 --> 00:42:51,446
-Hello.
-Hello. Fancy seeing you here.

659
00:42:51,522 --> 00:42:53,217
Orange juice? Certainly.

660
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:56,418
Don<i>'</i>t tell me you<i>'</i>ve forsaken
your beloved whiskey and whiskeys.

661
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,688
No, l<i>'</i>ve just changed their color.

662
00:42:58,762 --> 00:43:02,254
l<i>'</i>m going for the pale pastel shades.
They<i>'</i>re more becoming to me.

663
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:04,323
How about you, Mr. Connor?
You drink, don<i>'</i>t you?

664
00:43:04,401 --> 00:43:06,392
-Alcohol, l mean.
-A little.

665
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:08,665
A little?
And you<i>'</i>re a writer?

666
00:43:08,739 --> 00:43:12,231
Tsk, tsk, tsk. l thought all writers
drank to excess and beat their wives.

667
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:15,870
You know, at one time l think
l secretly wanted to be a writer.

668
00:43:17,581 --> 00:43:20,709
Dexter, would you mind
doing something for me?

669
00:43:20,784 --> 00:43:22,775
-Anything. What?
-Get the heck out of here.

670
00:43:22,853 --> 00:43:24,320
l couldn<i>'</i>t do that.

671
00:43:24,388 --> 00:43:26,356
That wouldn<i>'</i>t be fair to you.
You need me too much.

672
00:43:26,423 --> 00:43:28,857
Would you tell me what
you<i>'</i>re hanging around for?

673
00:43:28,926 --> 00:43:32,225
-No, please don<i>'</i>t go, Mr. Connor.
-No, please don<i>'</i>t go, Mr. Connor.

674
00:43:32,296 --> 00:43:34,662
As a writer, this ought to be
right up your street.

675
00:43:34,731 --> 00:43:36,198
Don<i>'</i>t miss a word.

676
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:40,901
l never saw you looking better, Red.
You<i>'</i>re getting that fine, tawny look.

677
00:43:40,971 --> 00:43:44,702
Oh, we<i>'</i>re going to talk
about me, are we? Goody.

678
00:43:44,775 --> 00:43:48,108
lt<i>'</i>s astonishing what money can do
for people, don<i>'</i>t you agree, Mr. Connor?

679
00:43:48,178 --> 00:43:50,612
Not too much, you know.
Just more than enough.

680
00:43:52,449 --> 00:43:53,882
Take Tracy, for example.

681
00:43:53,951 --> 00:43:56,215
There was never a blow that
hasn<i>'</i>t been softened for her.

682
00:43:56,286 --> 00:43:59,221
Never a blow that won<i>'</i>t be softened.
lt<i>'</i>s even changed her shape.

683
00:43:59,289 --> 00:44:03,851
-She was once a dumpy little thing.
-l<i>'</i>m not interested in myself now.

684
00:44:03,927 --> 00:44:06,953
Not interested in yourself?
You<i>'</i>re fascinated, Red.

685
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:09,396
You<i>'</i>re far and away
your favorite person in the world.

686
00:44:09,466 --> 00:44:11,457
-ln case you don<i>'</i>t know--
-Of course, Mr. Connor...

687
00:44:11,535 --> 00:44:13,594
she<i>'</i>s a girl
who<i>'</i>s generous to a fault.

688
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:15,365
To a fault, Mr. Connor.

689
00:44:15,439 --> 00:44:17,566
Except to other people<i>'</i>s faults.

690
00:44:17,641 --> 00:44:19,609
For instance, she never had
any understanding...

691
00:44:19,676 --> 00:44:21,234
of my deep and gorgeous thirst.

692
00:44:21,311 --> 00:44:23,643
-That was your problem.
-Granted.

693
00:44:23,714 --> 00:44:26,706
But you took on that problem
with me when you took me, Red.

694
00:44:26,783 --> 00:44:28,842
You were no helpmate there.
You were a scold.

695
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:31,888
lt was disgusting.
lt made you so unattractive.

696
00:44:31,955 --> 00:44:35,152
A weakness, sure, and strength
is her religion, Mr. Connor.

697
00:44:35,225 --> 00:44:37,921
She finds human imperfection
unforgivable.

698
00:44:39,163 --> 00:44:41,427
When l discovered that
my relationship to her...

699
00:44:41,498 --> 00:44:44,763
was supposed to be not that of a loving
husband and a good companion but--

700
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:48,261
-Oh, never mind.
-Say it.

701
00:44:49,173 --> 00:44:52,142
But that of a kind of high priest
to a virgin goddess.

702
00:44:53,477 --> 00:44:56,275
Then my drinks grew deeper
and more frequent.

703
00:44:57,481 --> 00:45:00,041
l never considered you as that
nor myself.

704
00:45:00,117 --> 00:45:02,176
You did it without knowing it.

705
00:45:02,252 --> 00:45:06,814
And the night that you got drunk on
champagne and climbed out on the roof...

706
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:10,291
and stood there, naked,
with your arms out to the moon...

707
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,850
wailing like a banshee.

708
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:16,399
l never had the slightest recollection
of doing any such thing.

709
00:45:16,466 --> 00:45:19,230
You drew a blank.
You wanted to.

710
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:21,294
Mr. Connor, what would you--oh.

711
00:45:22,739 --> 00:45:24,866
A nice story for Spy,
incidentally.

712
00:45:24,942 --> 00:45:27,206
Yes. Too bad we can<i>'</i>t supply
photographs of you on the roof.

713
00:45:27,277 --> 00:45:29,802
Honestly, the fuss you made
over that silly, childish epis--

714
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,974
lt was enormously important
and most revealing.

715
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:36,383
The moon is also a goddess,
chaste and virginal.

716
00:45:36,453 --> 00:45:39,013
Stop using those foul words.

717
00:45:39,089 --> 00:45:41,649
What are you trying
to make me out as?

718
00:45:41,725 --> 00:45:44,819
-What do you fancy yourself as?
-l don<i>'</i>t know that l fancy myself--

719
00:45:44,895 --> 00:45:46,954
When l read you<i>'</i>re gonna marry
Kittredge l couldn<i>'</i>t believe it.

720
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:49,294
That<i>'</i>s why l<i>'</i>m here.
How could he even think of it?

721
00:45:49,366 --> 00:45:51,061
Because he<i>'</i>s everything you<i>'</i>re not.

722
00:45:51,134 --> 00:45:54,160
He<i>'</i>s been poor, he<i>'</i>s had to work,
and he<i>'</i>s had to fight for everything...

723
00:45:54,238 --> 00:45:57,639
and l love him as l never
even began to love you.

724
00:45:57,708 --> 00:46:01,144
Maybe so, but l doubt it.
lt<i>'</i>s just a swing from me...

725
00:46:01,211 --> 00:46:03,145
but it<i>'</i>s too violent a swing.

726
00:46:03,213 --> 00:46:05,306
Kittredge is no great
tower of strength.

727
00:46:05,382 --> 00:46:07,077
He<i>'</i>s just a tower.

728
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,708
You hardly know him.

729
00:46:08,785 --> 00:46:10,753
To hardly know him
is to know him well.

730
00:46:10,821 --> 00:46:14,257
Perhaps it offends my vanity to have
anyone who was even remotely my wife...

731
00:46:14,324 --> 00:46:15,985
remarry so obviously beneath her.

732
00:46:18,495 --> 00:46:21,828
How dare you, in this day and age,
use such an idiotic--

733
00:46:21,898 --> 00:46:25,061
l<i>'</i>m talking about the difference
in mind and spirit.

734
00:46:25,135 --> 00:46:27,899
You could marry Mac,
the night watchman. l<i>'</i>d cheer for you.

735
00:46:27,971 --> 00:46:30,701
-Kittredge is not for you.
-You bet he<i>'</i>s for me.

736
00:46:30,774 --> 00:46:33,038
He<i>'</i>s a great man and a good man.

737
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:35,806
Already he<i>'</i>s
of national importance.

738
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:38,404
You sound like Spy magazine talking.

739
00:46:38,482 --> 00:46:41,178
But whatever he is, toots,
you<i>'</i>ll have to stick.

740
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:44,448
-He<i>'</i>ll give you no out as l did.
-l won<i>'</i>t require one.

741
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:51,057
l suppose you<i>'</i>d still be attractive
to any man of spirit, though.

742
00:46:51,128 --> 00:46:54,120
There<i>'</i>s something engaging about it,
this "'goddess"' business...

743
00:46:54,197 --> 00:46:57,689
something more challenging to the male
than the more obvious charms.

744
00:46:57,768 --> 00:46:59,827
-Really?
-Really.

745
00:46:59,903 --> 00:47:01,837
We<i>'</i>re very vain, you know.

746
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:05,363
"'This citadel can and shall be taken,
and l<i>'</i>m the boy to do it."'

747
00:47:06,777 --> 00:47:10,406
You seem quite contemptuous of me
all of a sudden.

748
00:47:11,581 --> 00:47:14,049
No, Red, not of you.

749
00:47:14,117 --> 00:47:15,414
Never of you.

750
00:47:18,955 --> 00:47:22,584
Red, you could be the finest woman
on this earth.

751
00:47:22,659 --> 00:47:26,220
l<i>'</i>m contemptuous of something inside you
you either can<i>'</i>t help or won<i>'</i>t try to.

752
00:47:26,296 --> 00:47:28,127
Your so-called "'strength"'...

753
00:47:28,198 --> 00:47:31,099
your prejudice against weakness,
your blank intolerance.

754
00:47:31,168 --> 00:47:33,659
-ls that all?
-That<i>'</i>s the gist of it.

755
00:47:33,737 --> 00:47:37,673
Because you<i>'</i>ll never be a first-class
human being or a first-class woman...

756
00:47:37,741 --> 00:47:40,107
until you<i>'</i>ve learned to have
regard for human frailty.

757
00:47:41,578 --> 00:47:44,513
lt<i>'</i>s a pity your own foot
can<i>'</i>t slip a little sometime...

758
00:47:44,581 --> 00:47:46,913
but your sense of inner divinity
wouldn<i>'</i>t allow that.

759
00:47:46,983 --> 00:47:50,111
This goddess must
and shall remain intact.

760
00:47:52,356 --> 00:47:54,449
There are more of you
than people realize.

761
00:47:54,524 --> 00:47:57,516
A special class of the American female.
"'The Married Maidens."'

762
00:47:57,594 --> 00:47:59,528
So help me,
if you say another word--

763
00:47:59,596 --> 00:48:01,826
l<i>'</i>m through, Red.
For the moment l<i>'</i>ve had my say.

764
00:48:02,699 --> 00:48:05,293
l suppose l should object
to this twosome.

765
00:48:05,369 --> 00:48:07,303
That would be most objectionable.

766
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,474
Any time either of you
want my advice--

767
00:48:12,542 --> 00:48:14,874
-We<i>'</i>ll give you a ring.
-Thanks. Do that, will you?

768
00:48:20,317 --> 00:48:22,285
So long, Red.

769
00:48:22,352 --> 00:48:26,686
l left you a wedding present. Sorry l
hadn<i>'</i>t ribbon to tie it up with.

770
00:48:50,947 --> 00:48:52,642
Aren<i>'</i>t you swimming?

771
00:48:52,716 --> 00:48:54,980
We haven<i>'</i>t time.
Uncle Willie wants us at 8:00.

772
00:48:58,355 --> 00:49:00,983
Look what your friend
considers a wedding present.

773
00:49:03,093 --> 00:49:06,062
-Why, it<i>'</i>s a model of the True Love.
-The what?

774
00:49:07,197 --> 00:49:10,166
A boat he designed
and built, practically.

775
00:49:10,233 --> 00:49:14,260
We sailed it down the coast of Maine
and back the summer we were married.

776
00:49:14,337 --> 00:49:15,702
My, she was yare!

777
00:49:15,772 --> 00:49:17,239
"'Yare"'? What<i>'</i>s that mean?

778
00:49:17,307 --> 00:49:20,504
lt means, uh--
Oh, what does it mean?

779
00:49:21,611 --> 00:49:24,603
Easy to handle, quick to the helm.
Fast, bright.

780
00:49:25,849 --> 00:49:27,817
Everything a boat should be...

781
00:49:27,884 --> 00:49:29,818
until she develops dry rot.

782
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,559
Oh, George, to get away.

783
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:42,894
Somehow to be useful
in the world.

784
00:49:42,966 --> 00:49:44,831
Useful? You, Tracy?

785
00:49:44,901 --> 00:49:47,927
l<i>'</i>m gonna build you an ivory tower
with my own two hands.

786
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:50,699
Like fun you are.

787
00:49:50,774 --> 00:49:53,572
You mean you<i>'</i>ve
been in one too long?

788
00:49:53,643 --> 00:49:58,239
Well, l mean that
and a lot of things.

789
00:50:08,959 --> 00:50:11,359
You know, we<i>'</i>re gonna
represent something, Tracy...

790
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:13,862
you and l and our home.

791
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:17,161
Something straight, sound and fine.

792
00:50:17,234 --> 00:50:20,601
Then perhaps Mr. Haven will be
somewhat less condescending.

793
00:50:27,577 --> 00:50:29,704
You don<i>'</i>t really mind him, do you?

794
00:50:30,847 --> 00:50:32,815
l mean the fact of him?

795
00:50:32,883 --> 00:50:34,817
"'Fact of him"'?
What do you mean?

796
00:50:34,885 --> 00:50:36,944
l mean--
Well, you know.

797
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,488
That he ever was
my lord and master.

798
00:50:39,556 --> 00:50:40,989
That we ever were--

799
00:50:41,057 --> 00:50:43,252
l don<i>'</i>t believe
he ever was, Tracy.

800
00:50:43,326 --> 00:50:44,418
Not really.

801
00:50:44,494 --> 00:50:47,930
l don<i>'</i>t believe that anyone ever was
or ever will be.

802
00:50:47,998 --> 00:50:50,728
That<i>'</i>s the wonderful thing
about you, Tracy.

803
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,165
What? How?

804
00:50:52,235 --> 00:50:56,638
You<i>'</i>re like some marvelous, distant,
well, queen, l guess.

805
00:50:56,706 --> 00:51:00,369
You<i>'</i>re so cool and fine
and always so much your own.

806
00:51:00,443 --> 00:51:03,742
There<i>'</i>s a kind of beautiful purity
about you, Tracy, like a statue.

807
00:51:03,813 --> 00:51:05,747
-George--
-lt<i>'</i>s grand, Tracy.

808
00:51:05,815 --> 00:51:08,045
lt<i>'</i>s what everybody
feels about you.

809
00:51:08,118 --> 00:51:10,313
lt<i>'</i>s what l first
worshipped you for from afar.

810
00:51:10,387 --> 00:51:13,322
-George, listen.
-First, now and always.

811
00:51:14,991 --> 00:51:17,323
Only from a little nearer now,
eh, darling?

812
00:51:17,394 --> 00:51:21,990
l--l don<i>'</i>t want to be worshipped.
l want to be loved.

813
00:51:22,065 --> 00:51:25,159
Well, you<i>'</i>re that too, Tracy.
You<i>'</i>re that, all right.

814
00:51:25,235 --> 00:51:28,102
l mean really loved.

815
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:31,004
But that goes
without saying, Tracy.

816
00:51:31,074 --> 00:51:35,306
No. No, now it<i>'</i>s you
who doesn<i>'</i>t see what l mean.

817
00:51:39,983 --> 00:51:42,417
l<i>'</i>d better get dressed.
l hate to be late.

818
00:51:49,759 --> 00:51:53,024
Oh, nothing. Run along.
l<i>'</i>ll be dressed when you get back.

819
00:52:35,238 --> 00:52:37,672
You<i>'</i>re Uncle Willie<i>'</i>s guest of honor.
You mustn<i>'</i>t be late.

820
00:52:37,741 --> 00:52:40,608
That fiance of yours roared
out of here on two wheels.

821
00:52:40,677 --> 00:52:42,907
Does he, by any chance,
ever walk anywhere?

822
00:52:42,979 --> 00:52:45,038
When he likes, l expect.

823
00:52:45,115 --> 00:52:48,346
l have a feeling he<i>'</i>ll take that ring
tomorrow and go through center with it.

824
00:52:48,418 --> 00:52:50,045
Seth, you idiot!

825
00:52:51,888 --> 00:52:53,981
Very amusing, l<i>'</i>m sure.

826
00:52:54,057 --> 00:52:57,220
Almost as amusing as the sight of you
with your arm around Mother.

827
00:52:59,362 --> 00:53:00,852
l find very unamusing...

828
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:03,558
the stupid, undignified spectacle
we<i>'</i>re making of ourselves...

829
00:53:03,633 --> 00:53:06,033
for the benefit
of those two newspaper people.

830
00:53:06,102 --> 00:53:07,569
Whose fault is it?

831
00:53:07,637 --> 00:53:10,970
That<i>'</i>s not the point. They can publish
anything they like about me...

832
00:53:11,041 --> 00:53:13,601
but l insist that we inform Connor
and the camera lady...

833
00:53:13,677 --> 00:53:16,077
that we<i>'</i>re all aware
of their purpose here.

834
00:53:16,146 --> 00:53:18,410
All right.
l<i>'</i>ll tell them myself.

835
00:53:19,649 --> 00:53:24,052
lt<i>'</i>d look better coming from me
as the titular head of the family.

836
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,782
Of course, inasmuch as you<i>'</i>ve
let us in for it in the first place!

837
00:53:26,856 --> 00:53:29,620
Keep that note out of your voice.
lt<i>'</i>s very unattractive.

838
00:53:29,693 --> 00:53:34,221
Oh? How does your dancer friend talk,
or does she purr?

839
00:53:34,297 --> 00:53:35,889
-Tracy!
-lt<i>'</i>s quite all right.

840
00:53:35,965 --> 00:53:39,162
Sweet and low, l suppose.
Dulcet. Very ladylike.

841
00:53:39,235 --> 00:53:42,170
You<i>'</i>ve got nerve to come back here in
your best head-of-the-family manner...

842
00:53:42,238 --> 00:53:46,072
and make stands and strike attitudes
and criticize my fiance...

843
00:53:46,142 --> 00:53:48,201
and give orders
and mess things up generally.

844
00:53:48,278 --> 00:53:50,576
-Stop it instantly!
-l can<i>'</i>t help it! lt<i>'</i>s sickening!

845
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:54,413
-As if he<i>'</i>d done nothing at all.
-Which happens to be the truth.

846
00:53:54,484 --> 00:53:57,419
Anyway, it<i>'</i>s not your affair.
lf it concerns anyone--

847
00:53:59,022 --> 00:54:01,616
Well, actually, l don<i>'</i>t know
who it concerns except your father.

848
00:54:03,193 --> 00:54:05,753
That<i>'</i>s very wise of you, Margaret.

849
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:08,992
What most wives fail to realize is that
their husbands<i>'</i> philandering...

850
00:54:09,065 --> 00:54:11,329
has nothing whatever
to do with them.

851
00:54:11,401 --> 00:54:14,564
Oh? Then what has it to do with?

852
00:54:15,538 --> 00:54:18,666
A reluctance to grow old, l think.

853
00:54:18,742 --> 00:54:21,973
l suppose the best mainstay a man
can have as he gets along in years...

854
00:54:22,045 --> 00:54:24,036
is a daughter.

855
00:54:24,114 --> 00:54:26,048
The right kind of daughter.

856
00:54:26,116 --> 00:54:27,708
How sweet.

857
00:54:27,784 --> 00:54:30,651
No, l<i>'</i>m talking seriously about
something l<i>'</i>ve thought over thoroughly.

858
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,017
l<i>'</i>ve had to.

859
00:54:32,088 --> 00:54:34,249
A devoted young girl
gives a man the illusion...

860
00:54:34,324 --> 00:54:36,292
that youth is still his.

861
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:39,157
-Very important, l suppose.
-Oh, very, very.

862
00:54:39,229 --> 00:54:42,687
Because, without her, he might be
inclined to go in search of his youth.

863
00:54:42,766 --> 00:54:46,395
That<i>'</i>s just as important to him
as it is to any woman.

864
00:54:46,469 --> 00:54:49,336
But with a girl of his own,
full of warmth for him...

865
00:54:49,405 --> 00:54:52,101
full of foolish, unquestioning,
uncritical affection--

866
00:54:52,175 --> 00:54:54,837
-None of which l<i>'</i>ve got.
-None.

867
00:54:54,911 --> 00:54:57,277
You have a good mind,
a pretty face...

868
00:54:57,347 --> 00:54:59,611
a disciplined body that does
what you tell it.

869
00:54:59,682 --> 00:55:03,641
You have everything it takes to make
a lovely woman except the one essential.

870
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,211
An understanding heart.

871
00:55:06,289 --> 00:55:09,019
Without that, you might as well
be made of bronze.

872
00:55:12,061 --> 00:55:15,394
That<i>'</i>s an awful thing
to say to anyone.

873
00:55:16,533 --> 00:55:18,501
Yes, it is indeed.

874
00:55:20,904 --> 00:55:24,101
So l<i>'</i>m to blame
for Tina Mara, am l?

875
00:55:24,174 --> 00:55:27,041
-To a certain extent, l expect you are.
-You coward!

876
00:55:28,611 --> 00:55:32,377
But better that than a prig
or a perennial spinster...

877
00:55:32,448 --> 00:55:34,245
however many marriages.

878
00:55:34,317 --> 00:55:36,512
-Seth, that<i>'</i>s too much.
-l<i>'</i>m afraid it<i>'</i>s not enough.

879
00:55:36,586 --> 00:55:38,383
l<i>'</i>m afraid nothing is.

880
00:55:38,454 --> 00:55:42,618
-What did you say l was?
-Do you want me to repeat it?

881
00:55:45,528 --> 00:55:47,462
A prig and a--

882
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:52,657
You mean you think l think l<i>'</i>m some kind
of a goddess or something?

883
00:55:52,735 --> 00:55:55,932
lf your ego
wants it that way, yes.

884
00:55:56,005 --> 00:55:58,667
Also, you<i>'</i>ve been talking
like a jealous woman.

885
00:56:03,746 --> 00:56:06,772
What<i>'</i>s the matter with everyone
all at once, anyhow?

886
00:56:08,017 --> 00:56:11,384
l<i>'</i>ve been asleep.
What time is it?

887
00:56:11,454 --> 00:56:13,615
-After 7:00.
-Call my house.

888
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:15,783
Tell them l<i>'</i>m on my way.
You<i>'</i>d better come along too.

889
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:18,885
You<i>'</i>re the host tonight,
you know? Uncle Willie.

890
00:56:18,962 --> 00:56:21,624
That<i>'</i>s all over.
You<i>'</i>re yourself again. So am l.

891
00:56:21,698 --> 00:56:24,326
-You<i>'</i>ve told them?
-l shall at the first opportunity.

892
00:56:26,236 --> 00:56:28,500
My first party, and about time.

893
00:56:28,571 --> 00:56:30,505
-Can l have a cocktail?
-Certainly not!

894
00:56:30,573 --> 00:56:33,974
-lt<i>'</i>s a dirty gyp.
-That dress hikes up a little behind.

895
00:56:34,043 --> 00:56:36,739
-No, it<i>'</i>s me that does.
-You look adorable, Dinah.

896
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:39,077
Oh, thanks, Tracy.
Thanks ever so much.

897
00:56:39,148 --> 00:56:40,877
Tracy, you must dress.

898
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:44,010
Let<i>'</i>s all have a last drink.
l<i>'</i>m sorry. l forgot. You never drink.

899
00:56:44,087 --> 00:56:45,884
-Prigs don<i>'</i>t.
-What<i>'</i>s that?

900
00:56:45,955 --> 00:56:48,287
-Nor spinsters.
-Again, please?

901
00:56:48,358 --> 00:56:50,451
Nor goddesses of any variety.

902
00:56:51,594 --> 00:56:54,620
Not completely.
Just a borderline case.

903
00:56:54,697 --> 00:56:57,165
Miss lmbrie and l
have something on our minds.

904
00:56:57,233 --> 00:56:59,394
Splendid.
Just the place for it. What?

905
00:56:59,469 --> 00:57:03,496
-We<i>'</i>d like to say something.
-l<i>'</i>m all ears and eyes.

906
00:57:05,408 --> 00:57:07,968
You<i>'</i>re a vision of loveliness,
Miss lmbrie.

907
00:57:08,044 --> 00:57:09,978
Will you have a cocktail
or champagne?

908
00:57:10,046 --> 00:57:12,480
Oh, champagne.
l<i>'</i>ve never had enough.

909
00:57:12,548 --> 00:57:14,175
You will, tonight.

910
00:57:17,887 --> 00:57:20,321
-l<i>'</i>d like to say--
-l have something to say first.

911
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:23,882
-l am Seth Lord.
-No!

912
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:27,361
-Then that makes you--
-Available.

913
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:29,455
And you are Miss lmbrie
of Spy magazine.

914
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,659
-Now you know.
-l was going to tell you--

915
00:57:32,735 --> 00:57:36,227
-As to the reasons--
-Not now. We ought to be early.

916
00:57:36,306 --> 00:57:39,742
And who<i>'</i>ll go with me
in my little car?

917
00:57:39,809 --> 00:57:43,905
Dinah and l. Seth, will you take
Miss lmbrie and Mr. O<i>'</i>Connor? Dinah?

918
00:57:45,081 --> 00:57:48,710
l can tell there<i>'</i>s something in the air,
because l<i>'</i>m being taken away.

919
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,711
Well, l<i>'</i>ll see you all later.

920
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:57,316
Don<i>'</i>t do that.
What<i>'</i>s the matter?

921
00:57:57,393 --> 00:57:58,792
Nothing.

922
00:57:58,861 --> 00:58:00,294
Miss lmbrie?

923
00:58:02,332 --> 00:58:05,665
You know, l felt exactly
as though l<i>'</i>d been pinched.

924
00:58:05,735 --> 00:58:07,669
Don<i>'</i>t you think you weren<i>'</i>t.

925
00:58:14,177 --> 00:58:15,769
You aren<i>'</i>t even dressed.

926
00:58:15,845 --> 00:58:18,245
Um, you go ahead.

927
00:58:18,314 --> 00:58:21,647
l<i>'</i>ll, uh,
follow along with George.

928
00:58:21,718 --> 00:58:23,652
What<i>'</i>s the matter with Tracy?

929
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,454
You tell me, will you?

930
00:58:26,522 --> 00:58:29,787
Darned if l know.
l<i>'</i>d like to.

931
00:58:29,859 --> 00:58:34,057
Well, Macaulay,
if you ever happen to find out--

932
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:36,496
l<i>'</i>ll tell you. Sure.

933
00:58:36,566 --> 00:58:39,126
And remember, Mike:

934
00:58:39,202 --> 00:58:42,365
-"'With the rich and mighty"'--
-"'Always a little patience"'?

935
00:59:37,026 --> 00:59:39,494
Do you know what time it is?

936
00:59:39,562 --> 00:59:41,427
lt<i>'</i>s after 4:00.

937
00:59:41,497 --> 00:59:44,489
ln China it<i>'</i>s later than that.

938
00:59:44,567 --> 00:59:47,035
ln China we<i>'</i>d be married by now.

939
00:59:48,805 --> 00:59:51,205
Or perhaps it<i>'</i>s only yesterday.

940
00:59:51,274 --> 00:59:53,208
l<i>'</i>m going home after this dance.

941
00:59:53,276 --> 00:59:55,267
There was a Chinese poet
who was drowned...

942
00:59:55,344 --> 00:59:58,142
while trying to kiss
the moon in the river.

943
00:59:58,214 --> 01:00:01,081
-He was drunk.
-l<i>'</i>d say as much.

944
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:02,811
But he wrote beautiful poetry.

945
01:00:18,367 --> 01:00:21,768
Macaulay Connor of South Bend
reporting for duty.

946
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:23,931
l<i>'</i>m sorry, we<i>'</i>re going home
after this dance.

947
01:00:24,006 --> 01:00:27,032
You can<i>'</i>t do that to me,
not a friend of old Junius.

948
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:30,807
-l mean, not an old friend of Junius.
-l wish old Junius were here.

949
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,848
Tracy, l<i>'</i>ll get your wraps.

950
01:00:32,915 --> 01:00:34,576
He<i>'</i>ll wrap me up.

951
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:36,083
-Hello, you.
-Hello.

952
01:00:36,152 --> 01:00:38,518
-You look fine.
-l feel fine.

953
01:00:38,588 --> 01:00:40,283
Good, good.

954
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:44,586
Oh, wait a minute.
What was l saying?

955
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:47,629
Oh. Let<i>'</i>s have another drink,
or would Kittredge spank?

956
01:00:47,697 --> 01:00:51,224
-That<i>'</i>s not what you were saying.
-lt isn<i>'</i>t? All right.

957
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,530
Not what l was saying.

958
01:00:53,603 --> 01:00:55,264
Oh, oh, l know.

959
01:00:55,338 --> 01:00:58,830
Why do you wish your brother was here?
Does he like Kittredge?

960
01:00:58,908 --> 01:01:02,071
-Everybody likes Kittredge.
-Everybody likes Kittredge.

961
01:01:02,145 --> 01:01:05,637
Everybody except
C.K. Dexter Haven, huh?

962
01:01:07,884 --> 01:01:11,012
-Come on. We<i>'</i>ll have some wine.
-Some wine.

963
01:01:13,856 --> 01:01:17,257
Mother, l thought you<i>'</i>d
gone home ages ago.

964
01:01:17,326 --> 01:01:20,090
l should have, but l<i>'</i>ve been
having such a good time.

965
01:01:20,163 --> 01:01:23,724
-Everybody should have a good time.
-Darling, what<i>'</i>s come over you?

966
01:01:23,799 --> 01:01:26,393
Oh, it<i>'</i>s just that
a lot of things...

967
01:01:26,469 --> 01:01:29,267
l always thought were
terribly important...

968
01:01:29,338 --> 01:01:33,741
l find now are--
and the other way around and--

969
01:01:33,809 --> 01:01:36,175
Oh, what the dickens.

970
01:01:36,245 --> 01:01:39,043
Connor, you<i>'</i>re thirsty,
and the night is young.

971
01:01:40,216 --> 01:01:42,776
-Here we are, dear.
-We<i>'</i>re going to have one more drink--

972
01:01:42,852 --> 01:01:46,185
-Not you, l<i>'</i>m afraid.
-Why should you be afraid?

973
01:01:46,255 --> 01:01:48,985
-You know wine never affects me.
-Look here--

974
01:01:49,058 --> 01:01:52,585
What she really wants, George,
is another dance with you.

975
01:01:52,662 --> 01:01:55,631
-Oh, very well.
-lf it<i>'</i>s that much of a chore--

976
01:01:55,698 --> 01:01:58,360
-Not for me!
-You<i>'</i>ve already been too attentive!

977
01:01:58,434 --> 01:02:00,265
George, please.

978
01:02:00,336 --> 01:02:02,463
What will the neighbors think?

979
01:02:06,442 --> 01:02:09,104
-The course of true love.
-Gathers no moss.

980
01:02:17,853 --> 01:02:20,287
Boy, champagne.

981
01:02:21,791 --> 01:02:25,090
Just the bottle.
l<i>'</i>m going on a picnic.

982
01:02:28,464 --> 01:02:31,831
-You<i>'</i>re leaving us, Jock?
-Rather, but l<i>'</i>ll be back.

983
01:02:31,901 --> 01:02:34,096
Come on, darling, champagne!

984
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:36,229
And again and again and again!

985
01:02:43,646 --> 01:02:45,443
Follow that cab!

986
01:02:45,514 --> 01:02:47,675
-What cab, sir?
-No cab.

987
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:51,811
Some joke, huh? Take me to
the C.K. Dexter Haven mansion.

988
01:02:51,887 --> 01:02:54,481
-Mr. Haven?
-Front entrance.

989
01:03:00,696 --> 01:03:02,561
C.K. Dexter Haven!

990
01:03:07,336 --> 01:03:09,270
This is where
Cinderella gets off.

991
01:03:09,338 --> 01:03:13,672
You hurry back to the ball before you
turn into a pumpkin and six white mice.

992
01:03:13,743 --> 01:03:15,904
Good-bye.
C.K. Dexter Haven.

993
01:03:19,982 --> 01:03:22,610
-What<i>'</i>s up?
-You are.

994
01:03:22,685 --> 01:03:24,619
l hope it<i>'</i>s worth it.
Come on in.

995
01:03:24,687 --> 01:03:26,848
l bring you greetings.

996
01:03:26,922 --> 01:03:30,255
Cinderella<i>'</i>s slipper.
lt<i>'</i>s called champagne.

997
01:03:30,326 --> 01:03:33,489
Champagne is a great "'levelerer."'
Leveler.

998
01:03:33,562 --> 01:03:36,793
-lt makes you my equal.
-l wouldn<i>'</i>t quite say that.

999
01:03:36,866 --> 01:03:39,266
Well, almost my equal.

1000
01:03:39,335 --> 01:03:42,270
C.K. Dexter Haven,
l would like to talk to you.

1001
01:03:42,338 --> 01:03:44,704
Let<i>'</i>s go in the talking room.

1002
01:03:48,611 --> 01:03:52,069
-Don<i>'</i>t tell me the party<i>'</i>s over so soon.
-No, no.

1003
01:03:52,148 --> 01:03:55,515
-l just felt like talking to you.
-Well, that<i>'</i>s nice.

1004
01:04:04,727 --> 01:04:07,025
l wonder if l might
borrow a drink.

1005
01:04:07,096 --> 01:04:09,621
Certainly.
Coals to Newcastle.

1006
01:04:09,699 --> 01:04:11,633
Here, sit down.

1007
01:04:23,346 --> 01:04:24,540
Excuse me.

1008
01:04:36,892 --> 01:04:38,416
What<i>'</i>s this?

1009
01:04:39,929 --> 01:04:41,590
-ls it my book?
-Yes.

1010
01:04:41,664 --> 01:04:44,565
C.K. Dexter Haven,
you have unsuspected depth.

1011
01:04:44,633 --> 01:04:47,693
-Thanks, old chap.
-But have you read it?

1012
01:04:47,770 --> 01:04:50,432
l was trying to stop drinking.
l read anything.

1013
01:04:50,506 --> 01:04:54,203
-And did you stop drinking?
-Yes. Your book didn<i>'</i>t do it, though.

1014
01:04:57,913 --> 01:05:00,040
Are you still in love with her?

1015
01:05:00,116 --> 01:05:03,552
Or perhaps you<i>'</i>d consider that
a very personal question.

1016
01:05:03,619 --> 01:05:06,349
-Not at all.
-Liz thinks you are!

1017
01:05:06,422 --> 01:05:07,787
Liz thinks you are.

1018
01:05:07,857 --> 01:05:11,554
But of course, women like to romanti--
romanticize about things.

1019
01:05:11,627 --> 01:05:14,926
-Yes, they do, don<i>'</i>t they?
-Yes, they do, don<i>'</i>t they?

1020
01:05:14,997 --> 01:05:18,194
l can<i>'</i>t understand how you
could<i>'</i>ve been married to her...

1021
01:05:18,267 --> 01:05:20,201
and still know
so little about her.

1022
01:05:20,269 --> 01:05:22,203
-Can<i>'</i>t you?
-No, l can<i>'</i>t you.

1023
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,698
l have the hiccups. l wonder
if l might have another drink?

1024
01:05:27,777 --> 01:05:29,711
-Certainly.
-Thank you.

1025
01:05:36,852 --> 01:05:39,218
You know, Tracy<i>'</i>s
no ordinary woman...

1026
01:05:39,288 --> 01:05:42,223
and you said some things to her
this afternoon l resented.

1027
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:45,124
-l apologize, Mr. Connor.
-That<i>'</i>s quite all right.

1028
01:05:45,194 --> 01:05:49,563
But when a girl is like Tracy,
she<i>'</i>s one in a million. She<i>'</i>s--

1029
01:05:49,632 --> 01:05:52,328
She<i>'</i>s sort of like a--
She<i>'</i>s sort of like a--

1030
01:05:52,401 --> 01:05:54,266
-A goddess?
-No, no, no!

1031
01:05:54,336 --> 01:05:57,635
You said that word
this afternoon. No.

1032
01:05:59,975 --> 01:06:02,273
She<i>'</i>s sort of like a queen...

1033
01:06:04,013 --> 01:06:07,176
a radiant, glorious queen...

1034
01:06:08,517 --> 01:06:10,985
and you can<i>'</i>t treat her
like other women.

1035
01:06:11,053 --> 01:06:15,387
No, l suppose not. But then, l imagine
Kittredge appreciates all that.

1036
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:18,393
Kittredge!
Kittredge appreciates Kittredge!

1037
01:06:18,461 --> 01:06:21,726
Ah, that fake "'man of the people."'
He isn<i>'</i>t even smart.

1038
01:06:21,797 --> 01:06:24,630
He<i>'</i>s a five-cent edition
of Sidney Kidd.

1039
01:06:26,035 --> 01:06:29,562
Well, l always thought Kidd himself
was the five-cent kid.

1040
01:06:29,638 --> 01:06:33,039
And what<i>'</i>s that make you worth,
C.K. Dexter Haven...

1041
01:06:33,108 --> 01:06:35,133
bringing us down here?

1042
01:06:35,211 --> 01:06:39,272
But you know why l did that.
To get even with my ex-bride.

1043
01:06:39,348 --> 01:06:41,646
Doggone it, C.K. Dexter Haven...

1044
01:06:41,717 --> 01:06:44,914
either l<i>'</i>m gonna sock you
or you<i>'</i>re gonna sock me!

1045
01:06:44,987 --> 01:06:46,978
Shall we toss a coin?

1046
01:06:48,958 --> 01:06:52,485
Kidd<i>'</i>s just using you
like he uses everybody else.

1047
01:06:54,296 --> 01:06:57,094
You don<i>'</i>t know Kidd
like l know him.

1048
01:06:57,166 --> 01:07:02,160
The guy<i>'</i>s colossal. He<i>'</i>s terrific.
He<i>'</i>s got everybody fooled.

1049
01:07:02,238 --> 01:07:04,604
Yes.

1050
01:07:04,673 --> 01:07:09,133
"'No mean Machiavelli
is smiling, cynical Sidney Kidd.

1051
01:07:09,211 --> 01:07:12,271
"'The world<i>'</i>s his oyster
with an <i>'</i>R<i>'</i> in every month."'

1052
01:07:13,349 --> 01:07:15,317
That<i>'</i>s not bad.
When did l say that?

1053
01:07:15,384 --> 01:07:16,942
You didn<i>'</i>t. l did.
Sorry.

1054
01:07:17,019 --> 01:07:19,988
l suppose you never heard about
Kidd<i>'</i>s arrangement in Kansas City?

1055
01:07:20,055 --> 01:07:21,545
-No.
-ln San Francisco?

1056
01:07:21,624 --> 01:07:23,990
Let me tell you about
the time he went to Boston...

1057
01:07:24,059 --> 01:07:27,392
to be awarded the Sarah Langley
Medal for World Peace.

1058
01:07:27,463 --> 01:07:30,626
The true story on that
little jaunt would ruin him.

1059
01:07:35,237 --> 01:07:38,434
Look, Connor. What would happen
to you if l used this stuff?

1060
01:07:38,507 --> 01:07:41,135
-Why?
-l might want to, very much.

1061
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:44,008
Kidd is holding a dirty piece
on Tracy<i>'</i>s father.

1062
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:46,639
-This might stop him.
-On Tracy<i>'</i>s father?

1063
01:07:46,715 --> 01:07:48,706
That<i>'</i>s right.

1064
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,218
Oh, so that<i>'</i>s how
Kidd got you to--

1065
01:07:53,289 --> 01:07:56,417
That<i>'</i>s how Liz and l were gotten in.
Blackmail, huh?

1066
01:07:56,492 --> 01:07:59,017
We all rode into this thing
on a filthy blackmail.

1067
01:07:59,094 --> 01:08:02,188
Look, you use it.
Use it with my blessings.

1068
01:08:02,264 --> 01:08:05,722
l<i>'</i>m through anyway. l<i>'</i>m not gonna
hand in a story on this wedding.

1069
01:08:05,801 --> 01:08:09,237
-l<i>'</i>m gonna write one on Kidd.
-No, let me do it.

1070
01:08:09,305 --> 01:08:11,569
l don<i>'</i>t have to tell him
where l got my facts. Okay?

1071
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,336
-Okay.
-All right, come on.

1072
01:08:16,912 --> 01:08:19,039
Now shoot.

1073
01:08:19,114 --> 01:08:21,048
Peace medal. Boston.

1074
01:08:21,116 --> 01:08:24,279
Oh, oh.
The time: May, 1938.

1075
01:08:24,353 --> 01:08:27,413
The place:
Boston, in a hotel.

1076
01:08:27,489 --> 01:08:29,218
Kidd had just arrived.

1077
01:08:29,291 --> 01:08:32,658
And this same Sidney Kidd,
ladies and gentlemen of America...

1078
01:08:32,728 --> 01:08:36,494
this protector of American democracy
and homes and firesides...

1079
01:08:36,565 --> 01:08:38,897
was at that very moment
entertaining...

1080
01:08:38,968 --> 01:08:42,028
the South Carolina Mata Hari
on his yacht.

1081
01:08:42,104 --> 01:08:44,197
Don<i>'</i>t interrupt me!

1082
01:08:44,273 --> 01:08:46,867
This Sidney Kidd,
ladies and gentlemen...

1083
01:08:46,942 --> 01:08:49,604
who demanded the respect...

1084
01:08:49,678 --> 01:08:52,112
of all who were
connected with him--

1085
01:08:52,181 --> 01:08:55,014
-We<i>'</i>ve come for the body of Macaulay.
-l<i>'</i>m glad you came.

1086
01:08:55,084 --> 01:08:58,417
-Can you use a typewriter?
-No, thanks. l have one at home.

1087
01:09:00,489 --> 01:09:01,421
Who<i>'</i>s that?

1088
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:04,755
Here was Sidney Kidd,
ladies and gentlemen...

1089
01:09:04,827 --> 01:09:07,421
Sidney Kidd the good,
Sidney Kidd the noble--

1090
01:09:07,496 --> 01:09:09,259
Where<i>'</i>s Kittredge?

1091
01:09:09,331 --> 01:09:10,923
-The people<i>'</i>s choice?
-Yeah.

1092
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,492
His bride just dropped him at
the gatehouse after a slight explosion.

1093
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:15,832
A fight?

1094
01:09:15,904 --> 01:09:18,304
Fifteen rounds, no decision.

1095
01:09:18,374 --> 01:09:20,706
Where<i>'</i>s my wandering parakeet?

1096
01:09:39,061 --> 01:09:40,995
You look beautiful, Red.

1097
01:09:45,868 --> 01:09:47,460
Come on in.

1098
01:09:49,505 --> 01:09:51,439
Why?

1099
01:09:51,507 --> 01:09:53,998
No particular reason.
A drink, maybe?

1100
01:09:56,111 --> 01:09:58,079
l don<i>'</i>t drink.

1101
01:09:58,147 --> 01:10:00,308
That<i>'</i>s right. l forgot.

1102
01:10:02,685 --> 01:10:04,277
l haven<i>'</i>t.

1103
01:10:09,358 --> 01:10:11,883
Show Liz to a typewriter
and stand back.

1104
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,087
-Can she do it?
-She can and she will.

1105
01:10:14,163 --> 01:10:17,155
-Dictate to her and then bring her home.
-Aren<i>'</i>t you coming, Liz?

1106
01:10:17,232 --> 01:10:19,666
lt seems l<i>'</i>ve got to
commit suicide first.

1107
01:10:19,735 --> 01:10:21,930
-Going my way, Miss?
-Miss Goddess to you.

1108
01:10:22,004 --> 01:10:24,199
Okay, Miss Goddess to me.

1109
01:11:00,909 --> 01:11:04,709
Champagne<i>'</i>s funny stuff.
l<i>'</i>m used to whiskey.

1110
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:08,238
Whiskey<i>'</i>s a slap on the back,
and champagne<i>'</i>s...

1111
01:11:08,317 --> 01:11:10,945
heavy mist before my eyes.

1112
01:11:13,255 --> 01:11:15,621
Do you hear a telephone ringing?

1113
01:11:15,691 --> 01:11:18,182
l did a little while ago.
Let<i>'</i>s see.

1114
01:11:20,629 --> 01:11:22,221
No, not yet.

1115
01:11:24,933 --> 01:11:27,493
Now l do, far away.

1116
01:11:30,873 --> 01:11:33,034
lt<i>'</i>s my bedroom telephone.

1117
01:11:34,977 --> 01:11:37,673
lt couldn<i>'</i>t be anyone but George.

1118
01:11:37,746 --> 01:11:40,306
l was sort of swinish to him.

1119
01:11:40,382 --> 01:11:43,146
Perhaps l<i>'</i>d better go
and see what--

1120
01:11:50,425 --> 01:11:52,359
lt isn<i>'</i>t ringing anymore.

1121
01:11:54,129 --> 01:11:55,756
l tell you what.

1122
01:11:55,831 --> 01:11:58,197
Let<i>'</i>s have a quick swim
to brighten us up.

1123
01:11:58,267 --> 01:12:00,258
Dexter and l always
swam after parties.

1124
01:12:00,335 --> 01:12:02,701
Let<i>'</i>s dip into this instead, huh?

1125
01:12:07,009 --> 01:12:09,773
-Hello, you.
-Hello.

1126
01:12:09,845 --> 01:12:12,279
-You look fine.
-l feel fine.

1127
01:12:13,282 --> 01:12:15,216
Did you enjoy the party?

1128
01:12:15,284 --> 01:12:17,752
Sure. Sure.

1129
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:20,687
The prettiest sight
in this fine, pretty world...

1130
01:12:20,756 --> 01:12:24,658
is the privileged class
enjoying its privileges.

1131
01:12:24,726 --> 01:12:28,253
-You<i>'</i>re a snob, Connor.
-No doubt. No doubt.

1132
01:12:28,330 --> 01:12:30,423
"'Awash with champagne...

1133
01:12:30,499 --> 01:12:33,332
"'was Will Q. Tracy<i>'</i>s
pleasure dome...

1134
01:12:33,402 --> 01:12:37,270
"'on the nuptial eve
of Tracy Samantha--Tracy--"'

1135
01:12:42,344 --> 01:12:44,835
You can<i>'</i>t marry that guy.

1136
01:12:45,714 --> 01:12:49,206
George? l<i>'</i>m going to.

1137
01:12:49,284 --> 01:12:51,081
-Why not?
-l don<i>'</i>t know.

1138
01:12:51,153 --> 01:12:54,247
l thought l<i>'</i>d be for it at first,
but you don<i>'</i>t seem to match up.

1139
01:12:54,323 --> 01:12:55,915
Then the fault<i>'</i>s with me.

1140
01:12:55,991 --> 01:12:58,289
Maybe so. But all the same,
you can<i>'</i>t do it.

1141
01:12:59,661 --> 01:13:02,357
Come around about noon tomorrow.

1142
01:13:02,431 --> 01:13:04,365
l mean today.

1143
01:13:05,934 --> 01:13:08,835
-Snob.
-What do you mean, "'snob"'?

1144
01:13:08,904 --> 01:13:13,671
You<i>'</i>re the worst kind there is,
an intellectual snob.

1145
01:13:13,742 --> 01:13:16,870
You made up your mind
awfully young, it seems to me.

1146
01:13:16,945 --> 01:13:19,175
Thirty<i>'</i>s about time
to make up your mind.

1147
01:13:19,248 --> 01:13:21,443
And l<i>'</i>m nothing of the sort.
Not Mr. Connor.

1148
01:13:21,516 --> 01:13:25,509
The time to make up
your mind about people...

1149
01:13:25,587 --> 01:13:27,179
is never.

1150
01:13:28,223 --> 01:13:31,215
Yes, you are,
and a complete one.

1151
01:13:31,293 --> 01:13:33,557
-You<i>'</i>re quite a girl, aren<i>'</i>t you?
-You think?

1152
01:13:33,629 --> 01:13:36,655
-Yeah, l know.
-l don<i>'</i>t think l<i>'</i>m exceptional.

1153
01:13:36,732 --> 01:13:40,099
-You are, though.
-l know any number like me.

1154
01:13:40,168 --> 01:13:42,432
You oughta get around more.

1155
01:13:44,973 --> 01:13:47,134
What, in the upper class?

1156
01:13:47,209 --> 01:13:49,609
No, no.
No, thank you.

1157
01:13:49,678 --> 01:13:53,842
You<i>'</i>re just a mass
of prejudices, aren<i>'</i>t you?

1158
01:13:53,916 --> 01:13:57,545
You<i>'</i>re so much thought
and so little feeling, Professor.

1159
01:13:57,619 --> 01:14:00,782
-l am, am l?
-Yes, you am, are you.

1160
01:14:00,856 --> 01:14:04,553
Your intolerance infuriates me!

1161
01:14:04,626 --> 01:14:07,891
l should think that, of all people,
a writer would need tolerance.

1162
01:14:07,963 --> 01:14:10,898
That fact is you<i>'</i>ll never,
you can<i>'</i>t be...

1163
01:14:10,966 --> 01:14:13,491
a first-rate writer
or a first-rate human being...

1164
01:14:13,568 --> 01:14:17,561
until you<i>'</i>ve learned to have
some small regard for human fra--

1165
01:14:22,044 --> 01:14:26,276
Aren<i>'</i>t the geraniums
pretty, Professor?

1166
01:14:28,216 --> 01:14:31,049
ls it not a handsome day...

1167
01:14:31,119 --> 01:14:33,952
that begins, Professor?

1168
01:14:34,022 --> 01:14:36,547
-Lay off that "'Professor."'
-Yes, Professor.

1169
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:39,287
You<i>'</i>ve got all the arrogance
of your class, all right.

1170
01:14:39,361 --> 01:14:42,159
How--what have classes
to do with it?

1171
01:14:42,230 --> 01:14:44,425
What do they matter
except for the people in them?

1172
01:14:44,499 --> 01:14:48,731
George comes from the so-called lower
class; Dexter from the upper. Well?

1173
01:14:48,804 --> 01:14:52,865
Mac, the night watchman, is a prince
among men; Uncle Willie is a pincher.

1174
01:14:54,509 --> 01:14:57,569
Upper and lower, my eye.
l<i>'</i>ll take the lower, thanks.

1175
01:14:57,646 --> 01:14:59,375
lf you can<i>'</i>t get a drawing room.

1176
01:14:59,448 --> 01:15:01,382
-What do you mean by that?
-My mistake.

1177
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:03,418
-You<i>'</i>re insulting!
-l<i>'</i>m sorry.

1178
01:15:03,485 --> 01:15:07,114
-Oh, don<i>'</i>t apologize!
-Who<i>'</i>s apologizing?

1179
01:15:08,123 --> 01:15:09,784
l never knew such a man.

1180
01:15:09,858 --> 01:15:12,258
You wouldn<i>'</i>t be likely to,
not from where you sit.

1181
01:15:12,327 --> 01:15:14,488
Talk about arrogance.

1182
01:15:15,564 --> 01:15:17,998
-Tracy.
-What do you want?

1183
01:15:19,334 --> 01:15:21,393
You<i>'</i>re wonderful.

1184
01:15:24,306 --> 01:15:27,002
There<i>'</i>s a magnificence
in you, Tracy.

1185
01:15:29,811 --> 01:15:32,780
Now l<i>'</i>m getting self-conscious.

1186
01:15:32,848 --> 01:15:35,043
lt<i>'</i>s funny, l--

1187
01:15:39,888 --> 01:15:40,980
Yeah?

1188
01:15:43,592 --> 01:15:46,755
l don<i>'</i>t know.
Go up, l guess. lt<i>'</i>s late.

1189
01:15:48,363 --> 01:15:52,026
A magnificence that comes out
of your eyes and your voice...

1190
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:55,035
in the way you stand there,
in the way you walk.

1191
01:15:55,103 --> 01:15:57,128
You<i>'</i>re lit from within, Tracy.

1192
01:15:57,205 --> 01:16:00,538
You<i>'</i>ve got fires
banked down in you...

1193
01:16:00,609 --> 01:16:04,238
hearth fires and holocausts!

1194
01:16:08,583 --> 01:16:10,517
l don<i>'</i>t seem to you
made of bronze?

1195
01:16:11,953 --> 01:16:15,252
No. You<i>'</i>re made out
of flesh and blood.

1196
01:16:15,323 --> 01:16:18,315
That<i>'</i>s the blank,
unholy surprise of it.

1197
01:16:19,394 --> 01:16:22,261
You<i>'</i>re the golden girl, Tracy...

1198
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:25,925
full of life and warmth
and delight.

1199
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:31,606
What goes on?
You got tears in your eyes.

1200
01:16:31,673 --> 01:16:33,538
Shut up. Shut up.

1201
01:16:33,608 --> 01:16:35,974
Oh, Mike, keep talking.
Keep talking.

1202
01:16:36,044 --> 01:16:37,978
Talk, will you?

1203
01:16:40,949 --> 01:16:43,509
No, no, l<i>'</i>ve--

1204
01:16:43,585 --> 01:16:45,246
l<i>'</i>ve stopped.

1205
01:16:46,822 --> 01:16:48,585
Why?

1206
01:16:48,657 --> 01:16:53,151
Has your mind taken hold again,
dear Professor?

1207
01:16:54,296 --> 01:16:57,732
Well, it<i>'</i>s a good thing,
don<i>'</i>t you agree?

1208
01:16:57,799 --> 01:16:58,925
No, Professor.

1209
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,127
Lay off that "'Professor"' stuff!
Do you hear me?

1210
01:17:01,203 --> 01:17:02,966
Yes, Professor.

1211
01:17:06,007 --> 01:17:08,441
-That<i>'</i>s all l am to you?
-Of course, Professor.

1212
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:11,138
-Are you sure?
-Why, yes, of course--

1213
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:16,516
Golly.

1214
01:17:22,891 --> 01:17:24,324
-Golly Moses!
-Tracy.

1215
01:17:24,392 --> 01:17:26,417
-Mr. Connor--
-Let me tell you something.

1216
01:17:26,495 --> 01:17:29,259
-l<i>'</i>ve got the shakes.
-lt can<i>'</i>t be anything like love, can it?

1217
01:17:29,331 --> 01:17:31,697
No, no, it mustn<i>'</i>t be.
lt can<i>'</i>t.

1218
01:17:31,766 --> 01:17:34,792
-Would it be inconvenient?
-Terribly.

1219
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:36,838
Anyway, l know it isn<i>'</i>t.

1220
01:17:36,905 --> 01:17:39,339
-Mike, we<i>'</i>re out of our minds.
-Right into our hearts.

1221
01:17:39,407 --> 01:17:41,932
-That ought to have music.
-lt does, doesn<i>'</i>t it?

1222
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:45,275
lt<i>'</i>s as if my insteps
were melting away.

1223
01:17:45,347 --> 01:17:48,043
-Have l got feet of clay?
-Tracy.

1224
01:17:48,116 --> 01:17:50,710
lt<i>'</i>s not far to the pool.
lt<i>'</i>s in the birch grove.

1225
01:17:50,785 --> 01:17:53,083
-lt<i>'</i>ll be lovely now.
-Tracy, you<i>'</i>re tremendous.

1226
01:17:53,155 --> 01:17:55,146
Put me in your pocket, Mike.

1227
01:18:10,305 --> 01:18:12,705
l can<i>'</i>t imagine what
makes me so sleepy.

1228
01:18:12,774 --> 01:18:16,175
-lt couldn<i>'</i>t be the company.
-lt<i>'</i>s you, Mr. Dexter.

1229
01:18:16,244 --> 01:18:18,804
-Hello, Mac.
-l heard you were about.

1230
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,815
-Any prowlers around?
-No prowlers.

1231
01:18:21,883 --> 01:18:25,512
-Can Miss lmbrie get in this way?
-lf she can<i>'</i>t, you can go in the back.

1232
01:18:25,587 --> 01:18:27,020
Good.

1233
01:18:30,425 --> 01:18:32,586
-Thanks, Mac. Good night.
-Good night, sir.

1234
01:18:32,661 --> 01:18:36,961
Well, home after
a hard day<i>'</i>s blackmailing.

1235
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,062
When are you going
to telephone Kidd?

1236
01:18:41,136 --> 01:18:43,297
ln time to get him here
for the wedding.

1237
01:18:43,371 --> 01:18:44,804
Why?

1238
01:18:45,707 --> 01:18:49,108
A sort of wedding present,
if it works.

1239
01:18:50,245 --> 01:18:52,008
lf it works.

1240
01:18:52,981 --> 01:18:55,506
l could still tear it up.

1241
01:18:55,584 --> 01:19:00,487
No. Mike<i>'</i>s only chance to ever become
a really fine writer is to get fired.

1242
01:19:01,356 --> 01:19:03,347
You<i>'</i>re a good number, Liz.

1243
01:19:03,425 --> 01:19:06,155
Oh, l just photograph well.

1244
01:19:07,229 --> 01:19:09,789
l<i>'</i>m certainly out of focus now.

1245
01:19:09,864 --> 01:19:11,957
Why don<i>'</i>t you take a swim?

1246
01:19:12,033 --> 01:19:14,058
-A swim?
-Sure.

1247
01:19:14,135 --> 01:19:17,229
Tracy and l always
took a swim after a party.

1248
01:19:17,305 --> 01:19:19,398
-Did you?
-Mm-hmm.

1249
01:19:19,474 --> 01:19:21,169
Bet it was fun.

1250
01:19:22,444 --> 01:19:24,878
l<i>'</i>ll have to try it
with Mike sometime.

1251
01:19:26,081 --> 01:19:28,743
Liz, why don<i>'</i>t you marry him?

1252
01:19:29,751 --> 01:19:31,946
-You really want to know?
-Mm-hmm.

1253
01:19:32,887 --> 01:19:35,253
He<i>'</i>s still got a lot to learn.

1254
01:19:35,323 --> 01:19:37,917
l don<i>'</i>t want to get
in his way for a while.

1255
01:19:42,564 --> 01:19:44,498
lt<i>'</i>s risky though, Liz.

1256
01:19:44,566 --> 01:19:46,796
Suppose another girl
came along in the meantime?

1257
01:19:46,868 --> 01:19:49,598
l<i>'</i>d scratch her eyes out,
l guess.

1258
01:19:49,671 --> 01:19:53,107
That is, unless she was going to
marry somebody else the next day.

1259
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:18,164
-Hello, Kittredge.
-What are you doing here?

1260
01:20:18,233 --> 01:20:20,497
l<i>'</i>m a friend of the family<i>'</i>s.
Dropped in for a chat.

1261
01:20:20,568 --> 01:20:23,128
Don<i>'</i>t try to be funny.
l asked you a question.

1262
01:20:23,204 --> 01:20:25,672
l could ask you
the same question.

1263
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:27,935
l telephoned Tracy,
and her phone didn<i>'</i>t answer.

1264
01:20:28,009 --> 01:20:30,239
l was worried,
so l walked over.

1265
01:20:30,312 --> 01:20:33,304
-l was worried too.
-About what?

1266
01:20:33,381 --> 01:20:36,908
What do you think of
this fellow Connor, or do you?

1267
01:20:36,985 --> 01:20:38,577
lf you<i>'</i>re trying to insinuate--

1268
01:20:38,653 --> 01:20:41,884
My dear chap, l wouldn<i>'</i>t
insinuate anything, only--

1269
01:20:49,164 --> 01:20:51,098
Kittredge,
l<i>'</i>d advise you to go to bed.

1270
01:20:51,166 --> 01:20:53,498
l don<i>'</i>t want your advice.
l<i>'</i>m staying right here.

1271
01:20:53,568 --> 01:20:56,969
You<i>'</i>re making a mistake.
Somehow l don<i>'</i>t think you<i>'</i>ll understand.

1272
01:20:57,038 --> 01:21:00,804
-Maybe you<i>'</i>d better leave that to--
-Dreams really do come true

1273
01:21:01,843 --> 01:21:04,437
Someday l<i>'</i>ll wish upon a star

1274
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:07,140
-What<i>'</i>s that?
-lt<i>'</i>s Mac, the night watchman.

1275
01:21:07,215 --> 01:21:09,274
Always singing.
l<i>'</i>ll walk you around the house.

1276
01:21:09,351 --> 01:21:12,445
Something<i>'</i>s going on here,
and l<i>'</i>m staying.

1277
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:14,181
And so are you.

1278
01:21:14,255 --> 01:21:16,985
All right, then.
Take the works.

1279
01:21:17,058 --> 01:21:19,526
Only heaven help you.

1280
01:21:19,594 --> 01:21:23,792
Somewhere over the rainbow

1281
01:21:23,865 --> 01:21:26,231
Way up high

1282
01:21:26,301 --> 01:21:29,293
There<i>'</i>s a land
that l heard of

1283
01:21:29,371 --> 01:21:32,169
Once in a lullaby

1284
01:21:38,246 --> 01:21:41,477
And the dreams

1285
01:21:41,549 --> 01:21:44,143
That l dare to dre--

1286
01:21:44,219 --> 01:21:46,744
-Uh-oh.
-Don<i>'</i>t stop, Mikey.

1287
01:21:46,821 --> 01:21:48,413
Keep crooning.

1288
01:21:51,226 --> 01:21:56,095
Someday over the rainbow

1289
01:21:56,164 --> 01:21:58,394
Way up high

1290
01:21:58,466 --> 01:22:01,401
-What is this, Connor?
-Easy, old man. She<i>'</i>s not hurt?

1291
01:22:01,469 --> 01:22:05,496
-No, no.
-Not wounded, sire, but dead.

1292
01:22:05,573 --> 01:22:08,872
Seems the minute she hit the water,
the wine hit her.

1293
01:22:08,943 --> 01:22:11,241
-Look here, Connor.
-A likely story!

1294
01:22:12,313 --> 01:22:14,440
-What<i>'</i>d you say?
-A likely story!

1295
01:22:14,516 --> 01:22:16,450
-lf you think that--
-You<i>'</i>ll be down directly?

1296
01:22:16,518 --> 01:22:18,315
-Yes, if you want!
-l want.

1297
01:22:19,087 --> 01:22:20,714
Hello, Dexter.

1298
01:22:20,789 --> 01:22:22,654
Hello, George.

1299
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:25,217
Hello, Mike.

1300
01:22:33,735 --> 01:22:36,226
Second door to the right,
top of the stairs. Don<i>'</i>t wake Dinah.

1301
01:22:36,304 --> 01:22:38,704
My feet are made of clay.
Did you know?

1302
01:22:38,773 --> 01:22:40,968
Good night, little man.

1303
01:22:44,779 --> 01:22:47,213
How are the mighty fallen.

1304
01:22:50,685 --> 01:22:52,949
lf l know Tracy,
and l know her well...

1305
01:22:53,021 --> 01:22:55,182
she<i>'</i>ll remember little of this.

1306
01:22:55,256 --> 01:22:58,123
For the second time in her life,
she<i>'</i>ll draw quite a tidy blank.

1307
01:23:01,996 --> 01:23:04,829
-You don<i>'</i>t believe it, then?
-Believe what?

1308
01:23:04,899 --> 01:23:08,562
Well, the implications of
what you saw, let us say.

1309
01:23:08,636 --> 01:23:11,799
-What else am l to believe?
-That<i>'</i>s entirely up to you.

1310
01:23:11,873 --> 01:23:15,104
l got eyes, l got imagination,
haven<i>'</i>t l?

1311
01:23:15,176 --> 01:23:17,167
l don<i>'</i>t know.
Have you?

1312
01:23:17,245 --> 01:23:20,009
Oh, so you pretend
not to believe it.

1313
01:23:20,081 --> 01:23:22,015
Yes, l pretend not to.

1314
01:23:22,083 --> 01:23:24,313
-Then you don<i>'</i>t know women.
-That<i>'</i>s possible.

1315
01:23:24,385 --> 01:23:26,876
-And you<i>'</i>re a fool.
-That<i>'</i>s quite possible.

1316
01:23:28,056 --> 01:23:31,082
-You won<i>'</i>t be too hard on her?
-l<i>'</i>ll make up my own mind what l<i>'</i>ll be!

1317
01:23:31,159 --> 01:23:32,922
We<i>'</i>re all only human, you know.

1318
01:23:32,994 --> 01:23:36,054
You! All of you with
your sophisticated ideas!

1319
01:23:36,865 --> 01:23:38,526
Ain<i>'</i>t it awful?

1320
01:23:45,173 --> 01:23:46,834
Why, you low--

1321
01:23:49,577 --> 01:23:51,010
What right have you--

1322
01:23:51,079 --> 01:23:53,673
A husband<i>'</i>s.
<i>'</i>Til tomorrow, Kittredge.

1323
01:23:57,185 --> 01:23:59,119
Hey, fella.

1324
01:24:00,321 --> 01:24:02,915
How do you feel?

1325
01:24:02,991 --> 01:24:04,925
-lf you think l--
-l know.

1326
01:24:04,993 --> 01:24:07,689
l<i>'</i>m sorry. l thought l<i>'</i>d better
hit you before he did.

1327
01:24:07,762 --> 01:24:10,754
He<i>'</i>s in better shape than l am.

1328
01:24:10,832 --> 01:24:12,697
Well, you<i>'</i>ll do.

1329
01:24:14,869 --> 01:24:17,895
Hello, Mr. Dexter.
Anything wrong?

1330
01:24:17,972 --> 01:24:20,600
Not a thing, Mac.
Just as quiet as a church.

1331
01:24:20,675 --> 01:24:22,609
Who is it?

1332
01:24:26,047 --> 01:24:29,107
Doggone. l thought it
might<i>'</i>ve been Mr. Kittredge.

1333
01:24:29,183 --> 01:24:31,083
We can<i>'</i>t have everything, Mac.

1334
01:24:32,253 --> 01:24:33,880
Good night.

1335
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:00,605
-Mr. Tracy--
-Good grief, man.

1336
01:25:00,682 --> 01:25:03,412
Don<i>'</i>t scream at me at the top
of your voice like that.

1337
01:25:03,484 --> 01:25:05,543
Miss Dinah is waiting for you, sir.

1338
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:08,020
Miss Dinah waiting for me?
Where and why?

1339
01:25:08,089 --> 01:25:10,421
Just outside the door, sir.
l don<i>'</i>t know why.

1340
01:25:10,491 --> 01:25:13,722
This is one of those days
which the pages of history teach us...

1341
01:25:13,795 --> 01:25:16,286
are best spent lying in bed.

1342
01:25:23,404 --> 01:25:25,065
Uncle Willie!

1343
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:28,199
Uncle Willie,
where are you going?

1344
01:25:28,276 --> 01:25:30,210
Back to bed, unless you
give me your oath...

1345
01:25:30,278 --> 01:25:32,212
you will speak in
a civilized tone of voice.

1346
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:35,613
l<i>'</i>ll be quiet, Uncle Willie.
lt<i>'</i>s so important that l see you.

1347
01:25:35,683 --> 01:25:39,312
Must we ride in that thing? Wouldn<i>'</i>t we
be more comfortable on pogo sticks?

1348
01:25:39,387 --> 01:25:42,584
l had to be alone with you,
and this is very intimate.

1349
01:25:54,669 --> 01:25:57,035
-What<i>'</i>s the matter?
-Oh, nothing much.

1350
01:25:57,105 --> 01:25:59,039
My head just fell off, that<i>'</i>s all.

1351
01:26:00,808 --> 01:26:04,539
What is all this gibberish
about Mr. Connor?

1352
01:26:04,612 --> 01:26:07,604
What makes you suspect what
and since when?

1353
01:26:07,682 --> 01:26:11,049
Last night,
and well into the morning.

1354
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:13,610
Uncle Willie,
isn<i>'</i>t my duty to tell George?

1355
01:26:13,688 --> 01:26:15,451
He might want to marry her anyway.

1356
01:26:15,523 --> 01:26:19,459
But she can<i>'</i>t. lf she marries anyone,
it<i>'</i>s got to be Mr. Connor.

1357
01:26:19,527 --> 01:26:22,655
Why, Dinah.
What makes you think she should?

1358
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:25,756
Apparently the little cherub
has heard or seen something.

1359
01:26:26,834 --> 01:26:28,825
That<i>'</i>s Dexter<i>'</i>s own Dinah.

1360
01:26:28,903 --> 01:26:32,236
You have a certain amount of cheek
walking in here on this of all mornings.

1361
01:26:32,306 --> 01:26:34,672
-Do l?
-Yes.

1362
01:26:34,742 --> 01:26:36,676
What<i>'</i>s all this
about Mr. Connor, Dinah?

1363
01:26:36,744 --> 01:26:39,042
Did the party last night
give you bad dreams?

1364
01:26:39,113 --> 01:26:41,946
-lt wasn<i>'</i>t any dream.
-l wouldn<i>'</i>t be too sure.

1365
01:26:42,016 --> 01:26:44,348
lt<i>'</i>s hard to tell once you<i>'</i>ve
gone to sleep, isn<i>'</i>t it?

1366
01:26:44,419 --> 01:26:45,681
ls it?

1367
01:26:47,422 --> 01:26:50,186
What-ho, the bride.

1368
01:26:56,597 --> 01:26:57,859
Hello.

1369
01:26:58,666 --> 01:27:02,158
Um, isn<i>'</i>t it a fine day, though.

1370
01:27:05,573 --> 01:27:06,835
ls everybody fine?

1371
01:27:08,076 --> 01:27:09,475
That<i>'</i>s fine.

1372
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:13,213
My, l<i>'</i>m hearty.

1373
01:27:15,383 --> 01:27:17,317
How do you feel otherwise?

1374
01:27:17,385 --> 01:27:19,376
l don<i>'</i>t know what<i>'</i>s the matter with me.

1375
01:27:19,454 --> 01:27:21,422
l must have had
too much sun yesterday.

1376
01:27:21,489 --> 01:27:24,117
-My eyes don<i>'</i>t open properly.
-Really?

1377
01:27:24,192 --> 01:27:27,719
Ugh! Please go home, Dext.

1378
01:27:27,795 --> 01:27:29,820
Not until we<i>'</i>ve got
those eyes open.

1379
01:27:29,897 --> 01:27:32,092
Uncle Willie. Good morning.

1380
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:33,895
That remains to be seen.

1381
01:27:35,236 --> 01:27:37,431
Aren<i>'</i>t you here early,
Uncle Willie?

1382
01:27:37,505 --> 01:27:39,905
lt<i>'</i>s nearly half past twelve.

1383
01:27:39,974 --> 01:27:41,942
lt can<i>'</i>t be.
Where<i>'</i>s Mother?

1384
01:27:42,009 --> 01:27:44,842
She<i>'</i>s talking with the orchestra.
Father with the minister.

1385
01:27:44,912 --> 01:27:48,712
And Mr. Connor,
he hasn<i>'</i>t come down yet.

1386
01:27:50,051 --> 01:27:51,985
And it<i>'</i>s Saturday,
your wedding day, remember?

1387
01:27:52,053 --> 01:27:55,045
Thanks loads.
lt<i>'</i>s nice to have things account--

1388
01:27:55,123 --> 01:27:57,057
Only l wonder
what this might be.

1389
01:27:57,125 --> 01:27:59,150
-That looks like a wristwatch.
-But whose?

1390
01:27:59,227 --> 01:28:01,422
l found it in my room.
l nearly stepped on it.

1391
01:28:06,134 --> 01:28:10,332
Also, l think l was robbed at your house
last night, Uncle Willie.

1392
01:28:10,404 --> 01:28:12,929
My bracelet and engagement rings
are missing--

1393
01:28:13,007 --> 01:28:16,033
-Here you are.
-But you weren<i>'</i>t at the party.

1394
01:28:16,110 --> 01:28:17,600
-Wasn<i>'</i>t l?
-Were you?

1395
01:28:17,678 --> 01:28:20,374
Don<i>'</i>t tell me you don<i>'</i>t remember.

1396
01:28:20,448 --> 01:28:23,849
l do, now, sort of.

1397
01:28:23,918 --> 01:28:27,217
But there were such a lot of people.
l stayed so late.

1398
01:28:27,288 --> 01:28:29,347
You should have taken a quick swim
when you got home.

1399
01:28:29,423 --> 01:28:30,720
A swim?

1400
01:28:31,459 --> 01:28:33,188
A swim!

1401
01:28:33,261 --> 01:28:35,092
There! Now they<i>'</i>re open.

1402
01:28:35,163 --> 01:28:39,065
That was just the beginning,
and it was no dream.

1403
01:28:41,402 --> 01:28:43,393
Do you suppose,
speaking of eye-openers--

1404
01:28:43,471 --> 01:28:46,304
That<i>'</i>s the first sane remark
l<i>'</i>ve heard today. Come along.

1405
01:28:46,374 --> 01:28:49,969
l know a formula that can pop pennies
off the eyelids of dead lrishmen.

1406
01:28:51,245 --> 01:28:53,406
Dinah, if the conversation
should lag...

1407
01:28:53,481 --> 01:28:56,075
you might tell Tracy
about your dream.

1408
01:28:56,150 --> 01:28:58,820
-What did he say?
-Oh, nothing.

1409
01:28:58,820 --> 01:28:59,252
-What did he say?
-Oh, nothing.

1410
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:01,845
Tray, l hate you to get married
and go away.

1411
01:29:01,923 --> 01:29:05,222
l<i>'</i>ll miss you, darling.
l<i>'</i>ll miss all of you.

1412
01:29:05,293 --> 01:29:09,320
You know, l did have the funniest
dream about you last night.

1413
01:29:09,397 --> 01:29:11,558
Did you? Do you like
my dress, Dinah?

1414
01:29:11,632 --> 01:29:14,601
-Yes, ever so much.
-Feels awfully heavy.

1415
01:29:14,669 --> 01:29:17,069
lt was all certainly
pretty rooty-tooty.

1416
01:29:17,138 --> 01:29:19,663
-What was?
-My dream.

1417
01:29:19,740 --> 01:29:22,903
l dreamed l got up
and went over to the window.

1418
01:29:22,977 --> 01:29:25,912
Guess what l dreamed l saw coming over
out of the woods.

1419
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:29,006
l haven<i>'</i>t the faintest idea.
A skunk?

1420
01:29:29,083 --> 01:29:32,644
Well, sort of.
lt was Mr. Connor.

1421
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:34,153
Mr. Connor?

1422
01:29:34,222 --> 01:29:39,319
Yes, with his arms full of something,
and guess what it turned out to be.

1423
01:29:39,393 --> 01:29:42,658
-What?
-You, and some clothes.

1424
01:29:42,730 --> 01:29:47,258
Wasn<i>'</i>t it funny? lt was sort of like
as if you were coming from the pool.

1425
01:29:48,636 --> 01:29:50,627
The pool?

1426
01:29:50,705 --> 01:29:54,232
l<i>'</i>m going crazy. l<i>'</i>m standing here,
solidly, on my own two hands...

1427
01:29:54,308 --> 01:29:56,276
and going crazy.

1428
01:29:56,344 --> 01:30:00,678
-Then what?
-After a while, l opened my door...

1429
01:30:00,748 --> 01:30:03,273
and there he was in the hall,
still coming along with you...

1430
01:30:03,351 --> 01:30:05,649
puffing like a steam engine.

1431
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,711
His wind can<i>'</i>t be very good.

1432
01:30:07,788 --> 01:30:09,016
Then what?

1433
01:30:09,090 --> 01:30:12,389
-You were sort of crooning.
-l never crooned in my life.

1434
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:15,190
l<i>'</i>m only saying
what it sounded like.

1435
01:30:15,263 --> 01:30:16,696
And then he--

1436
01:30:18,032 --> 01:30:19,624
Guess what.

1437
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:21,031
l couldn<i>'</i>t possibly.

1438
01:30:21,102 --> 01:30:24,333
He sailed right into your room
with you, and that scared me...

1439
01:30:24,405 --> 01:30:26,532
so l got up
and went to your door...

1440
01:30:26,607 --> 01:30:29,770
and peeked in
to make sure you were all right.

1441
01:30:29,844 --> 01:30:31,675
And guess what.

1442
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:35,476
-What?
-You were. He was gone by then.

1443
01:30:36,384 --> 01:30:38,784
Gone?

1444
01:30:38,853 --> 01:30:42,016
Of course he was gone.
He was never there.

1445
01:30:42,089 --> 01:30:43,386
l know, Tracy.

1446
01:30:43,457 --> 01:30:46,949
-l should certainly hope you did.
-l<i>'</i>m certainly glad l do.

1447
01:30:47,028 --> 01:30:51,522
Because if l didn<i>'</i>t, and in a little
while l heard the minister say...

1448
01:30:51,599 --> 01:30:55,126
"'lf anyone knows any just cause
or reason why these two...

1449
01:30:55,202 --> 01:30:58,035
"'should not be united
in holy matrimony--"'

1450
01:30:58,105 --> 01:31:00,164
l just wouldn<i>'</i>t know what to do.

1451
01:31:00,241 --> 01:31:04,177
-Dexter says it<i>'</i>s a dream too.
-You told Dexter all that?

1452
01:31:04,245 --> 01:31:07,009
Not a word.
Not a single word.

1453
01:31:07,081 --> 01:31:08,946
You know how quick he is.

1454
01:31:09,016 --> 01:31:11,041
You little fiend.
How can you stand there--

1455
01:31:11,118 --> 01:31:13,450
Dinah, your mother wants
to have a look at you.

1456
01:31:13,521 --> 01:31:16,388
l look wonderful.
l smell good too.

1457
01:31:16,457 --> 01:31:18,448
-Father?
-Yes, Tracy.

1458
01:31:20,628 --> 01:31:23,620
l<i>'</i>m glad you came back.

1459
01:31:24,799 --> 01:31:26,460
l<i>'</i>m glad you<i>'</i>re here.

1460
01:31:26,534 --> 01:31:27,796
Thank you, child.

1461
01:31:29,070 --> 01:31:34,872
l<i>'</i>m sorry l<i>'</i>m--truly sorry
l<i>'</i>m a disappointment to you.

1462
01:31:34,942 --> 01:31:37,001
l never said that, daughter.

1463
01:31:38,479 --> 01:31:39,741
l never will.

1464
01:31:47,321 --> 01:31:49,619
-Good morning.
-Oh. Hello.

1465
01:31:52,626 --> 01:31:54,116
l<i>'</i>m testing the air.

1466
01:31:54,195 --> 01:31:56,425
l like it,
but it doesn<i>'</i>t like me.

1467
01:31:57,164 --> 01:31:58,426
Hello, Dinah.

1468
01:31:58,499 --> 01:32:00,797
How do you do?

1469
01:32:00,868 --> 01:32:02,733
Did you have a good sleep?

1470
01:32:02,803 --> 01:32:04,794
Wonderful. Wonderful.
And you?

1471
01:32:04,872 --> 01:32:08,000
Marvelous. Have you
ever seen a handsomer day?

1472
01:32:08,075 --> 01:32:10,373
Never, never.
What<i>'</i>d it set you back?

1473
01:32:10,444 --> 01:32:12,605
l got it for nothing
for being a good girl.

1474
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:14,113
Good. Good.

1475
01:32:16,017 --> 01:32:18,281
Don<i>'</i>t worry, l<i>'</i>m going.

1476
01:32:18,352 --> 01:32:19,717
Why should you?

1477
01:32:19,787 --> 01:32:22,950
l guess you must have things
you wish to discuss.

1478
01:32:23,024 --> 01:32:26,016
Only remember, it<i>'</i>s getting late.

1479
01:32:29,330 --> 01:32:32,959
She<i>'</i>s always trying
to make situations.

1480
01:32:43,477 --> 01:32:46,139
-What<i>'</i>s the matter with your chin?
-Chin?

1481
01:32:46,213 --> 01:32:48,681
Oh. Does it show that much?

1482
01:32:48,749 --> 01:32:50,182
A little. What happened?

1483
01:32:50,251 --> 01:32:52,776
l guess l stuck it out too far.

1484
01:32:52,853 --> 01:32:55,083
lnto a door in the dark?

1485
01:32:55,156 --> 01:32:58,956
Yes, that<i>'</i>s it.
What about you? You all right?

1486
01:32:59,026 --> 01:33:00,220
-Me?
-Yeah.

1487
01:33:00,294 --> 01:33:02,819
Of course.
Why shouldn<i>'</i>t l be?

1488
01:33:02,897 --> 01:33:05,457
That was a flock of wine
we got away with.

1489
01:33:05,533 --> 01:33:08,400
l guess we<i>'</i>re lucky
both to have such good heads.

1490
01:33:08,469 --> 01:33:11,438
Yeah, yeah, l guess that<i>'</i>s it.

1491
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:15,900
Well, anyway, l...

1492
01:33:15,976 --> 01:33:19,503
l had a simply wonderful evening.
l hope you enjoyed it too.

1493
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:21,514
l enjoyed the last part of it.

1494
01:33:22,616 --> 01:33:24,447
Really?

1495
01:33:24,518 --> 01:33:26,850
Why especially the last?

1496
01:33:26,921 --> 01:33:28,912
Tracy, are you asking me?

1497
01:33:30,524 --> 01:33:32,515
-Oh, you mean the swim.
-Yeah.

1498
01:33:33,594 --> 01:33:35,027
We did swim...

1499
01:33:36,831 --> 01:33:39,265
and so forth, didn<i>'</i>t we?

1500
01:33:40,401 --> 01:33:42,460
-Mike.
-Oh, Tracy, darling.

1501
01:33:42,536 --> 01:33:44,697
-What can l say to you?
-Not anything.

1502
01:33:44,772 --> 01:33:47,206
Don<i>'</i>t say anything
and especially not "'darling."'

1503
01:33:49,777 --> 01:33:52,177
-You<i>'</i>re going through with it?
-Through with what?

1504
01:33:52,246 --> 01:33:54,214
The wedding.

1505
01:33:54,281 --> 01:33:56,044
Why shouldn<i>'</i>t l?

1506
01:33:57,418 --> 01:34:00,216
Well, l made a funny discovery.

1507
01:34:00,287 --> 01:34:02,881
ln spite of the fact that
somebody<i>'</i>s up from the bottom...

1508
01:34:02,957 --> 01:34:05,084
he can still be quite a heel...

1509
01:34:05,159 --> 01:34:08,754
and even though somebody else
is born to the purple, he...

1510
01:34:08,829 --> 01:34:11,297
he can still be
a very nice guy.

1511
01:34:11,365 --> 01:34:14,823
l<i>'</i>m just repeating
what you said last night.

1512
01:34:14,902 --> 01:34:18,565
l said a lot of things
last night, it seems.

1513
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:20,698
Okay. No dice.

1514
01:34:21,842 --> 01:34:24,470
Also no regrets
about last night, huh?

1515
01:34:24,545 --> 01:34:26,240
Why should l have?

1516
01:34:26,313 --> 01:34:28,406
Tracy, you<i>'</i>re wonderful.

1517
01:34:28,482 --> 01:34:33,419
l<i>'</i>m asking you. Tell me straight out.
Tell me the reason why l should have.

1518
01:34:33,487 --> 01:34:35,421
No, don<i>'</i>t.

1519
01:34:35,489 --> 01:34:37,514
Just tell me, what time is it?

1520
01:34:38,225 --> 01:34:39,658
What? Oh.

1521
01:34:41,428 --> 01:34:43,555
What happened to my wristwatch?

1522
01:34:43,631 --> 01:34:45,599
Why, is it broken?

1523
01:34:45,666 --> 01:34:47,691
l must<i>'</i>ve lost it someplace.

1524
01:34:47,768 --> 01:34:51,568
l can<i>'</i>t tell you how extremely sorry
l am to hear that.

1525
01:34:53,307 --> 01:34:55,400
There. On the table.

1526
01:34:55,476 --> 01:34:59,173
l wonder who found it.
l<i>'</i>d offer a reward or something.

1527
01:34:59,246 --> 01:35:02,374
l don<i>'</i>t think that any reward
will be expected.

1528
01:35:03,584 --> 01:35:06,417
Funny that it<i>'</i>d pop up here.

1529
01:35:06,487 --> 01:35:10,116
Hey, what about an eye-opener?

1530
01:35:10,191 --> 01:35:14,252
My eyes are opened.
Go and get one if you want to, though.

1531
01:35:14,328 --> 01:35:16,296
Yeah, l think l will.
Excuse me.

1532
01:35:17,231 --> 01:35:18,994
Yes, yes.

1533
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:22,091
Just give Mr. Kittredge a message.

1534
01:35:22,169 --> 01:35:25,161
Tell him he<i>'</i>d better start
immediately. Thank you.

1535
01:35:26,307 --> 01:35:28,707
-Are you one of the musicians?
-Uh, no.

1536
01:35:28,776 --> 01:35:30,937
Of course,
you<i>'</i>re Junius<i>'</i>s friend.

1537
01:35:31,011 --> 01:35:34,469
Only you<i>'</i>re not. You don<i>'</i>t have
any violin strings, do you?

1538
01:35:37,284 --> 01:35:39,377
-Aspirin. Will that do?
-l don<i>'</i>t think so.

1539
01:35:39,453 --> 01:35:41,944
lt<i>'</i>s for a violin.
Oh, well, don<i>'</i>t bother.

1540
01:35:50,130 --> 01:35:53,429
-Hello, Connor. How are you?
-Just about as you<i>'</i>d think.

1541
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:54,762
You seen Kidd?

1542
01:35:54,835 --> 01:35:56,769
l left a copy of it
at my house for him.

1543
01:35:56,837 --> 01:35:59,465
-And?
-l<i>'</i>ll tangle with him after the wedding.

1544
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:01,838
-ls that an alcoholic beverage?
-Yes. Why?

1545
01:36:01,909 --> 01:36:04,002
-For me?
-No, for Tracy. You want one?

1546
01:36:04,078 --> 01:36:07,707
l<i>'</i>d sell my grandmother for a drink.
You know how l love my grandmother.

1547
01:36:07,781 --> 01:36:11,239
Uncle Willie<i>'</i>s in the pantry
doing weird and wonderful things.

1548
01:36:11,318 --> 01:36:13,582
Tell him l said
one of the same.

1549
01:36:13,654 --> 01:36:15,281
Mind if l make it two?

1550
01:36:15,356 --> 01:36:17,347
That<i>'</i>s between you
and your grandmother.

1551
01:36:34,475 --> 01:36:36,238
Doctor<i>'</i>s orders, Red.

1552
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:37,743
What is it?

1553
01:36:37,811 --> 01:36:40,712
Just the juice
of a few flowers.

1554
01:36:40,781 --> 01:36:43,511
lt<i>'</i>s a type of stinger.
Removes the sting.

1555
01:36:43,584 --> 01:36:47,350
-Oh, Dext, don<i>'</i>t say that.
-Why not, Red?

1556
01:36:47,421 --> 01:36:49,787
Nothing will.
Nothing ever can.

1557
01:36:53,294 --> 01:36:55,785
l<i>'</i>ve done the most
terrible thing to you.

1558
01:36:56,530 --> 01:36:58,122
To me?

1559
01:36:58,198 --> 01:37:00,758
l doubt that very much, dear.

1560
01:37:00,834 --> 01:37:02,768
You don<i>'</i>t know.

1561
01:37:02,836 --> 01:37:04,064
Maybe l shouldn<i>'</i>t, huh?

1562
01:37:04,138 --> 01:37:08,040
But you must. You<i>'</i>ve got to.
l couldn<i>'</i>t stand it if you didn<i>'</i>t.

1563
01:37:08,108 --> 01:37:10,474
Dexter, what am l going to do?

1564
01:37:10,544 --> 01:37:13,479
But why to me, darling?
Why ask me?

1565
01:37:14,748 --> 01:37:17,512
Why do l come into it anymore?

1566
01:37:17,584 --> 01:37:21,145
Aren<i>'</i>t you confusing me with a fellow
named Kittredge or something?

1567
01:37:21,221 --> 01:37:22,552
George!

1568
01:37:22,623 --> 01:37:26,719
George. Splendid chap, George.
Very high morals.

1569
01:37:26,794 --> 01:37:28,318
Very broad shoulders.

1570
01:37:28,395 --> 01:37:30,158
l<i>'</i>ve got to tell him.

1571
01:37:30,230 --> 01:37:33,597
-Tell him what, darling?
-l<i>'</i>ve got to tell him.

1572
01:37:34,668 --> 01:37:37,364
lf you<i>'</i>ve got to tell him,
you<i>'</i>ve got to tell him.

1573
01:37:37,438 --> 01:37:40,373
lf he<i>'</i>s got any brains, he<i>'</i>ll have
realized what a fool he made of himself.

1574
01:37:40,441 --> 01:37:43,376
Hello, George?
This is--yeah.

1575
01:37:43,444 --> 01:37:45,571
l don<i>'</i>t care whether
it<i>'</i>s bad luck or not...

1576
01:37:45,646 --> 01:37:48,342
but l<i>'</i>ve got to see you
before the wedding.

1577
01:37:48,415 --> 01:37:51,077
What? No, l didn<i>'</i>t get it.

1578
01:37:51,151 --> 01:37:52,914
Right. Come on the run.

1579
01:37:52,986 --> 01:37:55,011
-He sent a note over at ten.
-Good.

1580
01:37:55,089 --> 01:37:57,023
l told you he<i>'</i>d come to his senses.

1581
01:37:57,991 --> 01:38:00,789
-Was he here too?
-Sure.

1582
01:38:00,861 --> 01:38:03,455
Good golly.
Why didn<i>'</i>t you sell tickets?

1583
01:38:17,077 --> 01:38:18,567
Say something, Dext.

1584
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:21,513
Say anything.

1585
01:38:23,684 --> 01:38:26,881
-No, you do.
-Oh, Dext!

1586
01:38:26,954 --> 01:38:29,582
l<i>'</i>m such an unholy mess of a girl.

1587
01:38:31,091 --> 01:38:33,252
That<i>'</i>s no good.
That<i>'</i>s not even conversation.

1588
01:38:35,095 --> 01:38:37,757
But never in my life--

1589
01:38:37,831 --> 01:38:40,356
not if l live to be a hundred--

1590
01:38:40,434 --> 01:38:44,200
will l ever forget how you tried
to stand me on my feet again today.

1591
01:38:44,271 --> 01:38:46,262
Oh, you, you<i>'</i>re in great shape.

1592
01:38:48,909 --> 01:38:52,106
Tell me, what did you think
of my wedding present?

1593
01:38:52,179 --> 01:38:54,511
l like my presents
at least acknowledged, you know.

1594
01:38:54,581 --> 01:38:56,014
lt was beautiful.

1595
01:38:57,551 --> 01:38:59,542
And sweet, Dext.

1596
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:04,648
Yes. She was quite a boat,
the True Love, wasn<i>'</i>t she?

1597
01:39:04,725 --> 01:39:07,250
Was and is.

1598
01:39:09,296 --> 01:39:10,854
My, she was yare!

1599
01:39:12,032 --> 01:39:14,023
She was yare, all right.

1600
01:39:16,336 --> 01:39:18,998
l wasn<i>'</i>t, was l?

1601
01:39:21,074 --> 01:39:22,336
Not very.

1602
01:39:23,243 --> 01:39:25,370
You were good
at the bright work, though.

1603
01:39:25,446 --> 01:39:27,038
l made her shine.

1604
01:39:28,282 --> 01:39:30,307
Where is she now?

1605
01:39:30,384 --> 01:39:32,409
l<i>'</i>m gonna sell her to Rufe Watriss.

1606
01:39:33,554 --> 01:39:37,354
You<i>'</i>re going to sell
the True Love for money?

1607
01:39:37,424 --> 01:39:39,915
-Sure.
-To that fat old rum pot?

1608
01:39:39,993 --> 01:39:42,154
Oh, well, what does it matter?

1609
01:39:42,229 --> 01:39:44,220
When you<i>'</i>re through with a boat,
you<i>'</i>re through.

1610
01:39:45,566 --> 01:39:47,898
Besides, it was only comfortable
for two people.

1611
01:39:49,303 --> 01:39:50,736
Unless you want her.

1612
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:54,901
No. No, l don<i>'</i>t want her.

1613
01:39:57,811 --> 01:40:00,006
l<i>'</i>m designing another one anyway...

1614
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:02,071
along more practical lines.

1615
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:05,045
What will you call her?

1616
01:40:05,118 --> 01:40:08,053
l thought the True Love ll.
What do you think?

1617
01:40:08,121 --> 01:40:12,182
lf you call any boat that, l promise
l<i>'</i>ll blow you and it out of the water.

1618
01:40:12,259 --> 01:40:14,659
l<i>'</i>ll tell you
what you can call her.

1619
01:40:14,728 --> 01:40:18,323
-What?
-ln fond remembrance of me...

1620
01:40:18,398 --> 01:40:20,593
the Easy Virtue.

1621
01:40:20,667 --> 01:40:23,864
Shut up, Red. l can<i>'</i>t have you thinking
things like that about yourself.

1622
01:40:23,937 --> 01:40:28,431
What am l supposed to think when l--
l don<i>'</i>t know.

1623
01:40:28,509 --> 01:40:30,443
l don<i>'</i>t know anything anymore.

1624
01:40:31,512 --> 01:40:33,878
That sounds very hopeful, Red.

1625
01:40:33,947 --> 01:40:35,346
That sounds just fine.

1626
01:40:37,918 --> 01:40:41,081
We<i>'</i>re almost ready.
Stand up, dear.

1627
01:40:41,154 --> 01:40:44,146
Turn around.
Oh, yes, it<i>'</i>s lovely.

1628
01:40:44,224 --> 01:40:47,250
l<i>'</i>m glad we decided against--
Dexter, you shouldn<i>'</i>t be here--

1629
01:40:47,327 --> 01:40:48,817
against the blue one.

1630
01:40:48,896 --> 01:40:51,364
No games, Dexter.
George will be right over.

1631
01:40:51,431 --> 01:40:54,423
l just telephoned. Here<i>'</i>s a note
he sent you this morning.

1632
01:40:54,501 --> 01:40:57,629
Oh, dear,
doesn<i>'</i>t everything look lovely?

1633
01:40:57,704 --> 01:40:59,433
Dr. Parsons?

1634
01:41:00,841 --> 01:41:03,503
Mr. Kittredge hasn<i>'</i>t arrived yet,
Dr. Parsons.

1635
01:41:03,577 --> 01:41:05,807
Come along. l want you
to meet Tracy<i>'</i>s grandmother.

1636
01:41:05,879 --> 01:41:09,280
Tracy, don<i>'</i>t sit down again
until after the ceremony.

1637
01:41:09,349 --> 01:41:12,477
Dexter, they telephoned from your house
that a Mr. Sidney Kidd was there.

1638
01:41:12,553 --> 01:41:15,954
l was to tell you that he<i>'</i>s reading it.
Whatever does that mean?

1639
01:41:18,091 --> 01:41:21,458
l have a feeling it won<i>'</i>t be
so hard for me to resign now.

1640
01:41:21,528 --> 01:41:23,826
And belts will be worn tighter
this winter.

1641
01:41:25,399 --> 01:41:28,334
Well, Red, l<i>'</i>m afraid
it<i>'</i>s the deadline.

1642
01:41:29,570 --> 01:41:31,128
So is this. Listen.

1643
01:41:31,204 --> 01:41:33,832
"'My dear Tracy, l want you to know
that you will always be my friend...

1644
01:41:33,907 --> 01:41:37,673
"'but your conduct last night was so
shocking to my ideals of womanhood--"'

1645
01:41:37,744 --> 01:41:40,804
No, don<i>'</i>t go.
You might as well hear it too.

1646
01:41:40,881 --> 01:41:42,974
"'to my ideals of womanhood
that my attitude toward you...

1647
01:41:43,050 --> 01:41:45,348
"'and the prospect of a happy
and useful life together...

1648
01:41:45,419 --> 01:41:47,080
"'has been changed materially.

1649
01:41:48,221 --> 01:41:50,485
-"'Your breach of common decency--"'
-Tracy.

1650
01:41:51,892 --> 01:41:53,826
Hello, George.

1651
01:41:53,894 --> 01:41:55,987
Tracy, all these people.

1652
01:41:58,865 --> 01:42:01,197
lt<i>'</i>s only a letter
from a friend.

1653
01:42:01,268 --> 01:42:03,202
They<i>'</i>re my friends too.

1654
01:42:04,504 --> 01:42:06,631
"'...certainly entitles me
to a full explanation...

1655
01:42:06,707 --> 01:42:09,676
"'before going through
with our proposed marriage.

1656
01:42:09,743 --> 01:42:13,474
"'ln the light of day, l am sure
that you will agree with me.

1657
01:42:13,547 --> 01:42:16,482
"'Otherwise, with profound regrets
and all best wishes...

1658
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:18,040
"'yours very sincere--"'

1659
01:42:19,586 --> 01:42:22,214
Yes, George,
l quite agree with you.

1660
01:42:22,289 --> 01:42:25,019
ln the light of day
and the dark of night...

1661
01:42:25,092 --> 01:42:28,789
for richer, for poorer,
for better, for worse...

1662
01:42:28,862 --> 01:42:31,262
in sickness and in health and--

1663
01:42:32,532 --> 01:42:36,400
Thank you so very much
for your good wishes at this time.

1664
01:42:36,470 --> 01:42:39,667
-That<i>'</i>s all you have to say?
-What else?

1665
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:42,573
l wish, for your sake
as well as mine...

1666
01:42:42,643 --> 01:42:45,077
l had an explanation, but...

1667
01:42:45,145 --> 01:42:47,909
unfortunately, l have none.

1668
01:42:47,981 --> 01:42:50,211
You<i>'</i>d better just say
good riddance, George.

1669
01:42:50,283 --> 01:42:52,217
-lt isn<i>'</i>t easy.
-l don<i>'</i>t see why.

1670
01:42:53,687 --> 01:42:55,917
-Say something, stupid!
-Just wait a minute.

1671
01:42:55,989 --> 01:42:57,286
What for?

1672
01:42:57,357 --> 01:43:00,383
On the very eve of your wedding,
an affair with another man!

1673
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:03,691
l told you l agree, and l<i>'</i>ll
tell you again, good riddance to me.

1674
01:43:03,764 --> 01:43:06,824
Tracy, your attitude
is a little difficult to understand.

1675
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:09,391
-Yes, l can see that it would be.
-Not necessarily.

1676
01:43:09,469 --> 01:43:13,132
-You keep out of this.
-You forget, l am out of it.

1677
01:43:13,206 --> 01:43:16,266
Kittredge, it may
interest you to know...

1678
01:43:16,343 --> 01:43:19,039
that this so-called "'affair"'
consisted of exactly two kisses...

1679
01:43:19,112 --> 01:43:20,704
and a late swim.

1680
01:43:20,781 --> 01:43:22,612
-Thanks, but--
-Which l enjoyed...

1681
01:43:22,683 --> 01:43:25,481
and the memory of which
l wouldn<i>'</i>t part with for anything.

1682
01:43:25,552 --> 01:43:27,577
-lt<i>'</i>s no use, Mike.
-After which...

1683
01:43:27,654 --> 01:43:31,112
l deposited Tracy on her bed
in her room...

1684
01:43:31,191 --> 01:43:33,921
and returned down here to you two,
which doubtless you<i>'</i>ll remember.

1685
01:43:33,994 --> 01:43:35,985
Doubtless without a doubt.

1686
01:43:36,063 --> 01:43:38,759
You mean to say
that was all there was to it?

1687
01:43:38,832 --> 01:43:40,163
l do.

1688
01:43:41,835 --> 01:43:46,602
Why? Was l so unattractive,
so distant, so forbidding or something?

1689
01:43:46,673 --> 01:43:49,369
-This is fine talk too.
-l<i>'</i>m asking a question.

1690
01:43:49,443 --> 01:43:52,571
You were extremely attractive,
and as for distant and forbidding...

1691
01:43:52,646 --> 01:43:55,706
on the contrary, but you also
were a little the worse--

1692
01:43:55,782 --> 01:43:59,445
or better--for wine,
and there are rules about that.

1693
01:43:59,519 --> 01:44:02,682
Thank you, Mike.
l think men are wonderful.

1694
01:44:02,756 --> 01:44:04,485
The little dears.

1695
01:44:04,558 --> 01:44:07,425
l fail to see the humor
in this situation, Miss lmbrie.

1696
01:44:07,494 --> 01:44:10,725
l can appreciate that.
lt was hard for me too at first.

1697
01:44:10,797 --> 01:44:12,822
-Oh, Liz.
-lt<i>'</i>s all right, Tracy.

1698
01:44:12,899 --> 01:44:17,199
We all go haywire at times,
and if we don<i>'</i>t, maybe we ought to.

1699
01:44:18,872 --> 01:44:22,569
You see, it really wasn<i>'</i>t Tracy
at all, Mr. Kittredge.

1700
01:44:22,642 --> 01:44:26,806
lt was another girl.
A Miss Pommery, 1926.

1701
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:29,872
You<i>'</i>d had too much to drink, Tracy.

1702
01:44:29,950 --> 01:44:33,181
That seems to be
the consensus of opinion.

1703
01:44:33,253 --> 01:44:36,552
Will you promise me
never to touch the stuff again?

1704
01:44:36,623 --> 01:44:40,423
No, George.
l don<i>'</i>t believe l will.

1705
01:44:40,494 --> 01:44:42,587
There are certain things
about that other girl...

1706
01:44:42,662 --> 01:44:45,631
that...Miss Pommery <i>'</i>26,
l rather like.

1707
01:44:45,699 --> 01:44:48,429
-But a man expects his wife--
-To behave herself. Naturally.

1708
01:44:48,502 --> 01:44:50,436
To behave herself naturally.

1709
01:44:52,572 --> 01:44:53,903
Sorry.

1710
01:44:55,542 --> 01:44:59,672
lf it hadn<i>'</i>t been for that drink last
night, all this might not have happened.

1711
01:44:59,746 --> 01:45:02,180
Apparently nothing did.

1712
01:45:02,249 --> 01:45:04,217
What made you think it had?

1713
01:45:04,284 --> 01:45:06,479
Well, it didn<i>'</i>t take
much imagination.

1714
01:45:06,553 --> 01:45:09,886
Not much, perhaps,
but just of a certain kind.

1715
01:45:09,956 --> 01:45:12,049
lt seems you didn<i>'</i>t think
anything too well of yourself.

1716
01:45:12,125 --> 01:45:13,752
That<i>'</i>s the odd thing.

1717
01:45:13,827 --> 01:45:17,263
Somehow l<i>'</i>d have hoped that you<i>'</i>d
think better of me than l did.

1718
01:45:17,330 --> 01:45:19,992
l<i>'</i>m not going to quibble.
All the evidence was there.

1719
01:45:20,066 --> 01:45:23,126
And l was guilty straight off
until l was proved innocent.

1720
01:45:23,203 --> 01:45:25,228
Downright un-American,
if you ask me.

1721
01:45:25,305 --> 01:45:27,739
Nobody is asking you.

1722
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:29,799
You forgot your hat, Miss Tracy.

1723
01:45:29,876 --> 01:45:33,334
You look lovely, Miss Tracy.
All our very best wishes.

1724
01:45:35,382 --> 01:45:38,977
Dexter, l wish you<i>'</i>d let me know when
you invite people to Tracy<i>'</i>s weddings.

1725
01:45:39,052 --> 01:45:41,282
-What happened, darling?
-A Mr. Sidney Kidd is here.

1726
01:45:41,354 --> 01:45:43,379
He says he knows you.

1727
01:45:43,456 --> 01:45:45,754
Sidney Kidd is here himself?

1728
01:45:45,826 --> 01:45:47,987
What else did Mr. Sidney Kidd
have to say?

1729
01:45:48,061 --> 01:45:52,259
He sent you the strangest message.
He said, "'Tell Haven he wins."'

1730
01:45:52,332 --> 01:45:55,495
"'Tell him l<i>'</i>m licked."'
Wins what, Dexter?

1731
01:45:58,338 --> 01:46:02,365
Mr. Sidney Kidd<i>'</i>s presence here makes
the marriage of national importance.

1732
01:46:02,442 --> 01:46:04,910
l think it<i>'</i>s extremely kind
and thoughtful of him.

1733
01:46:08,048 --> 01:46:11,176
Come on, Tracy, it must be late.
Let<i>'</i>s let bygones be bygones.

1734
01:46:11,251 --> 01:46:13,116
What do you say?

1735
01:46:13,186 --> 01:46:16,280
Yes, and good-bye, George.

1736
01:46:17,924 --> 01:46:19,915
-l don<i>'</i>t understand you.
-Please, good-bye.

1737
01:46:19,993 --> 01:46:21,927
-Look here--
-You<i>'</i>re too good for me.

1738
01:46:21,995 --> 01:46:23,986
-You<i>'</i>re a hundred times too good.
-But l never said--

1739
01:46:24,064 --> 01:46:26,498
l<i>'</i>d make you most unhappy. Most.

1740
01:46:27,567 --> 01:46:29,660
That is, l<i>'</i>d do my best to.

1741
01:46:30,737 --> 01:46:33,604
Well, if that<i>'</i>s
the way you want it.

1742
01:46:33,673 --> 01:46:35,664
That<i>'</i>s the way it is.

1743
01:46:36,843 --> 01:46:39,607
All right.
Possibly it<i>'</i>s just as well.

1744
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:42,011
Yes, l thought you<i>'</i>d finally
come to that conclusion.

1745
01:46:44,117 --> 01:46:46,813
l have a feeling you had more
to do with this than anyone.

1746
01:46:46,887 --> 01:46:50,983
-Possibly, but you were a great help.
-You and your whole rotten class.

1747
01:46:51,057 --> 01:46:52,922
Class, my eye.

1748
01:46:52,993 --> 01:46:55,860
You<i>'</i>re on your way out,
the lot of you, and good riddance!

1749
01:46:58,231 --> 01:47:00,426
There goes George.

1750
01:47:08,241 --> 01:47:10,903
Oh, my sainted aunt!

1751
01:47:21,821 --> 01:47:24,949
-That welter of faces.
-Oh, my, they look solemn.

1752
01:47:25,025 --> 01:47:26,856
What am l to do?

1753
01:47:26,927 --> 01:47:28,360
-Tracy?
-Yes, Mike?

1754
01:47:28,428 --> 01:47:31,192
Parson Parsons has never seen
Kittredge before, has he?

1755
01:47:31,264 --> 01:47:34,961
l got you into this thing,
and l<i>'</i>ll get you out of it.

1756
01:47:35,035 --> 01:47:37,026
Will you marry me, Tracy?

1757
01:47:43,209 --> 01:47:44,506
No, Mike.

1758
01:47:45,578 --> 01:47:49,810
Thanks, but hmm-mm. Nope.

1759
01:47:49,883 --> 01:47:51,851
l<i>'</i>ve never asked a girl
to marry me.

1760
01:47:51,918 --> 01:47:53,476
l<i>'</i>ve avoided it.

1761
01:47:53,553 --> 01:47:55,919
But you<i>'</i>ve got me
all confused now.

1762
01:47:55,989 --> 01:47:57,354
Why not?

1763
01:47:58,658 --> 01:48:01,092
Because l don<i>'</i>t think Liz
would like it...

1764
01:48:02,462 --> 01:48:05,022
and l<i>'</i>m not sure you would...

1765
01:48:05,098 --> 01:48:08,761
and l<i>'</i>m even a little doubtful
about myself.

1766
01:48:09,836 --> 01:48:12,566
But l am beholden to you, Mike.

1767
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:14,971
l<i>'</i>m most beholden.

1768
01:48:16,209 --> 01:48:18,473
But they<i>'</i>re in there.
They<i>'</i>re waiting.

1769
01:48:18,545 --> 01:48:22,140
Don<i>'</i>t get too conventional all at once,
will ya? There<i>'</i>ll be a reaction.

1770
01:48:24,551 --> 01:48:28,681
Cheer up. lt<i>'</i>ll be all right.
You<i>'</i>ve been got out of jams before.

1771
01:48:28,755 --> 01:48:30,746
-Been got out of them?
-Certainly.

1772
01:48:30,824 --> 01:48:33,315
Don<i>'</i>t worry.
You always have been.

1773
01:48:36,363 --> 01:48:38,490
We<i>'</i>ve seen George.
lt<i>'</i>s all right, dear.

1774
01:48:38,565 --> 01:48:40,556
Your father will make
a very simple announcement.

1775
01:48:40,633 --> 01:48:43,500

in the proceedings.

1782
01:49:13,900 --> 01:49:17,996

-Two years ago, you were invited--
-My dear, just a loan.

1789

-Put this in your vest pocket.
-Don<i>'</i>t have a vest.

1790
01:49:43,563 --> 01:49:45,554
Then hold it in your hand.

1791
01:49:45,632 --> 01:49:48,226
-Which was very bad manners.
-Which was very bad manners.

1792
01:49:48,301 --> 01:49:51,464

01:50:00,713 --> 01:50:04,410

most beautifully planned.

1796

1798
01:50:10,957 --> 01:50:13,255
-Are you sure?
-No, but l<i>'</i>ll risk it. Will you?

1799
01:50:13,326 --> 01:50:17,353
You bet. You didn<i>'</i>t do it to soften
the blow? Nor to save my face?

1800
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:19,489
-No, it<i>'</i>s a nice face.
-l<i>'</i>ll be yare now.

How did this ever happen?

1807
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:35,571
You<i>'</i>d better tell Mr. Dutton
to start the music.

1808
01:50:35,648 --> 01:50:38,640
This can<i>'</i>t be happening. lt just can<i>'</i>t.

Let<i>'</i>s get in there.
Got the ring?

1810
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:43,348
The way we<i>'</i>re dressed,
we look like stowaways.

1811
01:50:43,423 --> 01:50:44,890
See ya soon, Red.

Wait. How do l look?

Like a goddess.

1819
01:51:03,610 --> 01:51:05,805
-And you know how l feel?

all this before in another life.
