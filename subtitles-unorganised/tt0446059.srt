1
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:17,000
During the late Qing Dynasty period, China
was crumbling under foreign oppression.

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,850
Weak and unable to resist, the Chinese were 
bullied, and branded "Sick Man of the East".
No one could stand up to the humiliation.

3
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,500
Attempting to further crush China's spirit,

3
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:31,200
the Shanghai Foreign Chamber of Commerce 
planned a martial arts exhibition,
pitting the champions of four nations 
against the Chinese.

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,200
One man took on the challenge...

5
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,500
and his name is Huo Yuan Jia.

6
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,800
"1910, Shanghai"

7
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,100
"Biarya Theatre, French concession"

7
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,200
"The competition's arena..."

8
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,200
Dearest guests! Today, four representatives 
of the Shanghai Foreign Business Association...

9
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,100
will be challenging the 
Jing Wu Sports Association's Huo Yuan Jia!

10
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,950
The competition's only rule is:

11
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,200
the outcome will be determined

12
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,300
by either a knockout or surrender.

13
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,500
"England's King of Boxing, Peter Smith"

14
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,000
Begin!

14
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,000
What's going on?

15
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,800
"Head trainer of Belgium's Royal Cavalry, Hans Hassel"

16
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,000
Excellent!
Good job, master!

18
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,700
"European fencing champion, Anthony Kasier"

19
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,750
And for our final round,

20
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,900
Japan's master of the Nine Demon
Gods style, Anno Tanaka...

21
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,000
will be taking on the Jing Wu Sports Association's 
Huo Yuan Jia!

22
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,400
"30 years ago, Tianjin, Huo family household"

23
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,700
Young master!

24
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,400
Come on, let's go now.

25
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,400
Stop!

26
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,800
How dare you!
Who let you in?

28
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
I came to bring you some tea, father.

29
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,800
How many times have I told you to
never come in here?

31
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,800
Go back to your calligraphy.

32
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,200
Continue!

33
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,300
Hmph, I have to write for you every time...

34
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,600
If your father ever knew about this,
he'd beat you to death for sure!

36
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,900
You don't tell, I don't tell, who'll know?

37
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,940
Hey, I want to show you something...let's go!

38
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,500
-Nong Jing Sun, hurry up!
-I'm coming!

40
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,500
Why are they fighting again?

41
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,300
They're beating the drums again!

42
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,500
On this day, Huo En Di 
of the Huo family style...

43
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
and Zhao Zhong Qiang 
of the Zhao family style...

44
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,500
will pit their skills against one another 
on this stage!

45
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,600
Sure! Good!

46
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,500
What are you two doing? Wanna die?
Your dad's gonna lose today, for sure!

48
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,300
You just watch!
Your dad's gonna get a taste of the Huo fist!


50
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
The Life-Death Pact has been signed!

51
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,100
Victory or defeat is determined amongst men.

52
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,500
Life and death is decided by God!

53
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,300
Masters! The competition shall begin!

54
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,200
Zhao Jian, NOW your dad knows
the real power of our Huo's fist!

56
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,700
And today's victor is...
Zhao Zhong Qiang!

58
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,700
Thank you, thank you so much!

59 
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Yuan Jia, Yuan Jia...

61
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,900
Let's go, Yuan Jia.

62
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,600
Yuan Jia, let's go back.
Yuan Jia...

64
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,100
Weren't you real brave just now?
What's the matter? 

65
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,900
If you've got guts, don't shy away like a rat.

66
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,100
Come on, get up!

67
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,700
Stop your bullying, Zhao Jian!

68
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,700
Shut your mouth! You're useless, and
the same goes for your family.

71
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,800
Fight me if you've got the guts!
I wanna show you just how tough the Zhao fist is!

73
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,300
On the stage!

74
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,800
Stop fighting, Yuan Jia!

75
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Stop, now!

76
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,800
Yeah! You won!

77
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,200
Today, you got schooled by the Zhao fist.
Don't ever mention your puny Huo fist again!

79
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,500
I won!

81
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,500
Yuan Jia...

82
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,000
Get up, Yuan Jia.
Let's go now.

84
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,800
I swear! Huo Yuan Jia won't let himself
be beaten down by anybody again!

86
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,000
Master, you...
Let me apply some medicine for you.

88
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,500
-Lai Fu, leave us.
-Yes.

91
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,400
What happened? Angry?

92
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,600
Mum, why won't Father let me learn martial arts?

93
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,400
That's because he loves you.
You were born with asthma...

95
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,800
and your body's weak. You couldn't
possibly take the vigorous training.

96
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,300
But, doesn't learning martial arts 
strengthen the body?

97
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,400
So you want to learn martial arts 
just to make your body stronger?

99
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:04,100
No, I want revenge!
I want Zhao Jian to know how good our Huo fist is!

101
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,900
Child, the most powerful part of martial arts
is not beating others down,

103
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,300
but controlling one's own desires.

104
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,900
No matter what, you mustn't forget about your virtue and morals.

105
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,600
Martial arts is for strengthening yourself 
and helping the needy,

106
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,200
not for causing trouble,
and certainly not for revenge.

107
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,250
Emm.

108
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,800
The way to interact with others
is to respect one another,

110
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,300
then, others will respect you in return.

111
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,500
Who'd dare to disrespect the strongest?

112
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,300
Others' fear and respect
are two completely different things...

113
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:53,400
Alright, keep writing.
Otherwise, your dad'll punish you again.

116
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,500
"Death Fist Stance"

117
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,500
I won!

118
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,000
Come on, fly, fly now!

119
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,200
Uh-oh...

120
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,600
You gonna fall! Fall fall...

121
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,000
I won't fall! I won't fall!

122
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,800
Then I'll make you fall *boom*

123
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,600
I won't fall!

124
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,000
Come on!

125
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I won't fall! 

126
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,100
Just move faster!

127
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,200
Oh!

128
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,000
Be careful!

129
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:10,200
-Good morning, Mom.
-Yuan Jia, you forgot your medicine again this morning.

131
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,900
Don't worry! Ever since I started training at West Lake,
my asthma hasn't acted up.

133
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,700
Wait, little miss!

134
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,900
Just look at your child...

135
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,300
Without a mother's care since young...
You've spoiled her completely.

136
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,500
You should marry again,
so that someone can help you take good care of her.

138
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,800
I've been busy building our reputation.

140
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,900
I want everyone in Tianjin to know and respect our family!

141
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,400
How would I have the time to remarry?

142
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,900
Come catch me! I wanna go hunt with you, Dad!

143
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,500
Although you've never been defeated this whole time,
your biggest opponent is yourself...

145
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:54,200
-And what you must conquer is really yourself.
-I understand.

148
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,200
"Writ of Challenge"

149
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,900
Master...
All right.

151
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Mom, rest well.

152
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,000
Father, your fist was neither 
fast nor vicious enough.

154
00:15:19,600 --> 000:15:25,700
But don't you worry, 'cause I'll make sure
that the Huos won't be defeated again!

156
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,700
"Life-Death Pacts"
-I WILL become First in Tianjin!

158
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,400
-Dad!
-My li'l Tsui!

160
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,100
For me?

161
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,200
-No, I can't!
-Gimme?

162
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,400
No, I won't.

163
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,500
-Then, what do I have to do?
-You can only have it after you win today.

165
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,100
-Really?
-Emm.

166
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,800
Pinky swear?

"1900, Tianjin"

168
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,200
We're counting on ya, Master Huo!

169
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:20,200
-Master Huo!
-Hey, Huo Yuan Jia!
 When're ya gonna be Tianjin's No.1?

171
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,700
-I don't know! What says you?
-It'll be today! Today!

173
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,200
Master Huo...

174
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Hey, Zhao Jian!
Where've you been hiding all these years?

176
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,300
I've travelled Jiang Nan's 17 provinces, 38 prefectures...

177
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,200
and I've got nothing but skill.
I'm invincible now!

179
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,900
-Bullcrap!
-You're the bullshitting one!

181
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,900
The Life-Death Pact has already been signed.
Now begins the competition!

183
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,200
Come on up!

184
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,500
Hahahaha! What? Scared?
Come up! Come fall to your death!

186
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,400
You just wait!
 
187
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,900
Master, you're too good!

188
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,200
Ha! My stance is as firm as tree roots!
I WILL beat your Huo fist today!

190
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,600
Well, I'll give you a chance
...to lose!

192
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Well done!

193
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
-Pussycat claw?
-Tiger Claw!!

194
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,500
Down!

195
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,700
Well done, master!

196
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,000
So you want me to fall, huh?

197
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,700
-Pussycat claw, definitely.
-It's Tiger Claw!!!!

198
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,300
You've already lost!

199
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,100
Ay! Careful!

200
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,600
Master...!

201

-You alright?
-I'm fine!!

-Don't touch me!

Huo Yuan Jia!

207
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,000
-Excellent, master!
-Thank you, thank you.

209
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,100
Thank you, everyone...

210
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,300
Congratulations! This way.

211
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,900
-Good job, Master Huo!
-Thank you!

212
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,500
We've reserved a table for you upstairs, Master Huo.

213
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,300
All right...

214
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,500
Yuan Jia!

215
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,900
Jing Sun!

216
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,300
Why so late?

217
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,700
Let's go, the usual spot.

218
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,400
Congratulations, Master Huo!

219
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,300
Congratulations, Master Huo!

220
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,800
Hello, everybody.

221
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,600
Come on, now.

222
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,700
Jing Sun...

223
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,600
This Gu Yue Resturant of yours is getting more and more popular.

224
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,100
It's all thanks to my friends' support.

225
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,700
Still remember when we were kids?

226
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,700
You were such a bookworm...

227
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,500
I never expected you to excel in business!

228
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,400
Hey, we live in some bad times.

229
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,600
If a bookworm like me hasn't got a small business, 

230
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,500
I wouldn't have many choices, would I?

231
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,200
Eat up, Yuan Jia.

232
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,400
These were made by the region's culinary masters.

233
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,300
Come on, try 'em!

234
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,300
All right, let's dig in!

235
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,900
After you, Master Huo.

236
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,600
Who are they?

237
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,600
-My name is Xia Shan.
-My name is Xu Da Shan.

238
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,700
We hope Master Huo will take us in as your pupils.
Master, we're most willing to serve you.

240
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,400
Sure! You two look like tough guys.
Serve'em wine!

242
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,500
Drink the wine, and we're brothers.
Cheers!

244
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,400
-Congratulations, Master Huo!
-Thank you, master!

246
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,600
-Such a happy occasion. All the drinks are on me!
-Thank you! Thank you!

248
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,600
Let's eat!

249
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:44,700
Li'l Tsui, don't wait anymore. It's bedtime, ok?
Take the young lady to her room.

251
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,500
-Li'l Tsui, come on.
-My good child, listen to me. Time for bed.

253
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,000
Come.

254
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,350
-What the heck is this?
-It's called coffee. Western stuff.

256
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,800
Not used to it, huh? 
These are chaotic times..

257
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,000
If the common people want to live better,
then they have to learn from others' advancements.

259
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,000
Even a businessman like me
can't always just focus on profits.

260
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,300
And martial artists can't just 
fight in arenas all day long.

262
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,500
-National affairs are important, too.
-National affairs? You scholars can worry about that.

264
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,300
Me, I'm a fighter.
I only want to be First in Tianjin!

265
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,000
Is that title really so important?

266
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,400
Hey, come with me.

267
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,800
Jing Sun, you've always been an offstage spectator.

268
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,300
Now that you're onstage,
can't you feel the difference?

270
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:56,600
-What's so different about this?
-As long as you're offstage,

272
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,300
the life-and-death struggle onstage has nothing to do with you!
You're just enjoying the fight, right?

274
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,400
But once you're standing here,
there's no other choice besides victory!

276
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,900
Well...you can choose not to go onstage.

277
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,400
Jing Sun, listen...

278
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,900
Listen to what?
I don't hear anything.

280
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,700
-Yes...I can hear it...
-(Master Huo, you're our hero!)

282
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,100
(Well done, good!)
(Good job, excellent!)

284
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,200
(Master Huo is champion of the world!!!)

285
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,400
Agh....here comes the Iron Head Stance!

286
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,600
-Thank you.
-Good job, master!

288
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,600
Look, let's save ourselves the trouble.
Whoever's signed the Pact, can all come on up!

290
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,500
All challengers, onstage!

291
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:27,200
-Huo Yuan Jia, when will you be Tianjin's No.1?
-What do you say?

294
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,900
Today's the day!

295
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,600
Hey, what do you people want?

296
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,900
We'll do anything to be Master Huo's pupils!

297
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:55,200
Good, good! You all look like tough guys.
Serve'em wine!

299
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,300
Drink the wiine, and we'll be brothers.
Bottoms up!

301
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:09,600
-Let's drink!
-Congratulations, Master Huo!

303
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,500
Thank you, do come again.

305
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:21,200
Boss, these are all Huo's bills.

306
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,700
Ok, I'll see to it.

310
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,200
You haven't defeated my foster father, Master Qin!

311
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,000
Come on, drink!

312
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:48,700
Yuen Jia, you've already won 38 straight rounds.
There are no more opponents for you in Tianjin. 

314
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,300
Wrong. There's still one...

315
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,500
Must you still fight?

316
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,200
To really be Tianjin's No.1, yes!

317
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:14,100
What about outside of Tianjin?
Beijing? Lianguang? Shanxi? Hunan?
When is it over?

319
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,700
I know what you're getting at. 
But I can't stop. Fighting's all I've got!

321
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Only by fighting can I prove 
that I'm stronger than others.

322
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:29,100
Even after you've proven yourself, so what?
Yuan Jia, stop and give it some thought.

325
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,700
What's this?

326
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:39,800
-The tabs your pupils and friends ran up this month.
-I'll pay for them.

328
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,700
They're all just using you!
Just how many of them treat you like a brother?

330
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,600
It's called personal loyalty.
And...

332
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:56,500
Fine, I'll send someone with the money tomorrow.

334
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,500
Yuan Jia, I didn't come here for money.

336
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,400
Accepting pupils and friends, 
you should look at their moral qualities,

338
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,500
not how well they can drink!

339
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
Watch your step, Master Huo.

341
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,700
Morning, Master Huo.

343
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:29,100
Hey, Master Qin, morning.

344
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,000
Aren't you Master Huo, 
the self-proclaimed champion of Tianjin?

345
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:47,800
-What a coincidence!
-Master Qin, I thought you've long since
 retired to Shanxi due to old age!

349
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,600
There's a long list of people 
waiting to be my students.

350
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,500
-It's quite puzzling.
-Hmph. I'm also puzzled... 

352
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,400
that you've prepared such a "large gift" for yourself.
Congratulations!

354
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:08,300
You're most welcome.
Actually, I bought it for you.

356
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,400
Go help your master!

357
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,600
Welcome, Master Qin.

358
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,800
Master, your income isn't enough 
to even support the household,

360
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:30,200
and those pupils of yours are running up more and more bills.

361
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,500
-And what about our savings?
-It was used up 3 months ago.

363
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,800
Used up? Empty...

365
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,100
Master!

366
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:53,400
Fine, Fine. I told you to train diligently,
but no one listens...

368
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:58,100
-Who did it?
-Master Qin!

370
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,300
Master!

371
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,500
Master!

372
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:21,600
Today's Master Qin's birthday...

373
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:26,600
-I wish Master Qin long life and happiness!
-Well done!

375
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:32,300
Father, I sincerely wish you longevity also.

377
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,200
Good!

378
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:46,800
-Let's drink to your health, master.
-All right...

381
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,800
Master Huo, today's my foster father's birthday.
He's booked this resturant.

383
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,800
If you're here to drink, 
kindly find another place.

384
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,300
I beseech you...

385
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,300
You have no place to speak.

386
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,900
Hey.

387
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,900
Today is my birthday.

388
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,800
I don't wish to fight. If there's a problem,
let's talk it over some other day.

389
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,200
Being the senior, have you no shame,
injuring my pupils?

391
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:32,000
-I, Huo Yuan Jia, have come for an explanation.
-What do you want?

393
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,700
I've already signed.
Put your name down, if you dare.

394
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,900
Otherwise, bow down and apologize!

395
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,800
Out of the way! YuanJia!

396
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,200
You're overreacting! His guests are all here.
Can't you just discuss this another day?

398
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:57,900
-I can't put up with that kind of insult.
-No matter what, I won't let you cause trouble
 at his birthday celebration!

401
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,600
-You accuse me of troublemaking?
-Yuen Jia...

402
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,700
Afraid I'll smash up your restaurant?

403
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,600
I, Huo Yuan Jia, will pay for any damages!

404
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,800
I can't believe you've said such things.

405
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,800
Leave now. Consider our years of friendship
null and void!

406
00:33:20:850 --> 00:33:22,050
Just like that?

407
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,500
All these years,
and now you don't want me?

409
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:38,600
You're blind!
Get out! All of you!

411
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,100
I want to avoid hurting any innocents...

412
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,200
Let's get going!

413
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,400
Master!

414
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,200
Master won again!

415
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,500
Let's go drink!

416
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,700
Not drunk, no return!

417
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,700
Let's go drink!

418
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,600
Not drunk, no return!

419
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,000
Careful...

420
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,300
Let me serve you a drink.

421
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,100
Come on, again!

422
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,400
Master's the most feared man here!

423
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,000
He's unbeatable! Just look at him!

424
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Esteemed Huo!

425
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,600
Congratulations.

426
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,700
Your longtime dream has come true. 
You're number 1.

427
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,300
But let me tell you;
Two hours ago, Master Qin died!

430
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,500
Heheheh....Huo Yuan Jia...

431
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,900
When'll you be Tianjin's No.1?

432
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,300
It's today! 

434
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:19,100
Heheh...Huo Yuan Jia...
it's today...

437
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,600
Huo Yuan Jia,
First in Tianjin...

439
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,100
It's today...heheh...

440
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Mother!

441
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,500
The young lady's room, quick.

442
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,800
I'm the one who killed them.

443
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,600
I'll take full responsibility for my actions.
Take care, foster mother.

445
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,600
Tell Master what you did!

446
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,200
-Tell him!
-Master...

447
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,800
I'm so sorry!
It's all my fault...

448
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:43,800
I had a relationship with Master Qin's concubine...

449
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,300
He found out and punished me!

451
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:57,100
Master, the others knew...
I thought they'd have told you!

453
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:06,000
Master! Master!
Master!

456
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,300
He has a fever.

457
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,800
I'll go fetch some medicine.

458
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,800
After he takes the medicine, he'll
sweat a little, and then he'll be fine.

459
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,800
He'll be fine...

460
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,300
Let's go...

461
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,600
He needs to rest. Let's go!

462
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,500
When I was 13, I started to not
see things so clearly.

464
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,500
In my eyes, there always seemed 
to be this fog that couldn't be lifted...

465
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,300
Back then, I cried day after day.

466
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,300
Grandma told me,

467
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,000
when you're unhappy inside,
you should cry.

468
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:17,300
When the crying's done, you still
have to move on.

469
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,000
But, in my heart, I saw it all.

470
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,800
Can you believe it?

471
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,400
How about I wash your hair?

472
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,500
After a while, hair gets knotty very easily.

473
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,600
Wash it often, and it'll stay clean and silky.

474
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,000
Grandma always says,

475
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,200
People should always keep themselves clean.

476
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,500
Only then can you live with clarity in the world.

477
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,100
There are no knots that can't be unravelled.

478
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,900
Ah Niou!

479
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,000
Ah Niou, you can really sleep!
You sleep as much as our dog, Ah Huang.

480
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:34,700
So, I named you Ah Niou.
Come, come, come, follow me!

482
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,900
Ah Niou, you're up!

483
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Let's go catch dragonflies and butterflies!

484
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,000
Tomorrow, bring him to the fields.

486
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,400
Some work will be good for him.

487
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,400
Sure!

488
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,800
Ah Niou...

489
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,200
Ah Niou...

490
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,200
Follow me, hurry.

491
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,700
Go, come... come here...

492
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,700
Look, you wasted your day's efforts.

493
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,500
Miss Yue Tzi won't let us say anything,

494
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,000
but she's redoing it all for you.

495
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,800
Seedlings have life, too.

496
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,100
They can't stay too close,

497
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,800
or it'll hinder growth.

498
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,100
Just like us humans...

499
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,200
In life, we must learn to respect each other.

500
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,000
Only then can we live peacefully and happily.

501
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:42,900
I'll remember that.

502
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,300
-Grandma, come, let's eat!
-Sure.

504
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,800
Grandma!

505
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,600
Yue Tzi.

506
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,200
Grandma...

507
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:46,000
In a couple of days,
it'll be time to visit the graves.

508
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:52,000
-Go pay your respects to your parents.
-Yes.

511
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:03,800
Grandma said that I should go visit my parents' graves.

512
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,700
Have some water.

513
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,000
I'd like to discuss something with you.

514
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,900
Are you leaving?

515
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,800
I'd also like to go pay my respects
to my parents' graves.

517
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,400
Filial piety is important. 
You should go.

518
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,000
I'll be coming back afterwards.

519
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,600
You've been here for many years...

520
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:59,300
I've always known that you'd
leave this village one day.

521
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,100
Actually, I...

522
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,800
Here is a change of clothes for
your journey. Please take them.

523
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:22,800
I haven't told you my name yet.

524
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,100
You need not tell me.

525
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,700
Where you came from...where you're going...
I need not know, either.

527
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:35,700
Remembering you as Ah Niou is enough for me.

528
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,000
My name is Huo Yuan Jia.

529
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,800
I'll remember.

530
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:12,200
"1907, Tianjin"

531
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:41,000
(Goodies!...)

532
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:44,800
(Money...Money...)

533
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,800
(God's Word must be trusted...)

534
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,800
(Trust God, and receive eternal life...)

535
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,100
(It's true, true...)

536
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,000
(Trust God, and receive eternal life...)

537
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,400
(The words He speaks are all in here...)

538
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,200
(God's Word is here...)

539
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:35,500
Huo Yuan Jia!...First in Tianjin!
Huo Yuan Jia!...Huo Yuan Jia!

545
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,800
You're back to fight again!

546
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:41,200
Huo Yuan Jia's back to fight again...

547
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,600
-Master... 
-Uncle Lai Fu.

548
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:31,900
You're back!
Allow me, allow me.

550
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,700
Sorry I haven't kept your home in proper order.

551
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:06,600
Master, accept my apology...

552
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:31,900
I've always thought...for when the Master returns...

553
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,400
everything in here, not a bit's been changed.

554
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:41,400
-It's been hard on you.
-It's my job, sire...

556
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:47,700
After you left, the creditors came every day,
demanding their debts.

558
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:52,700
All the things in the house, 
they took, one by one.

559
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:58,000
In the end, they even wanted the
house to pay off the debt.

560
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:02,700
Every single thing in this room
were retained only

561
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:07,100
because, luckily, someone 
sent us some money.

562
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,000
Afterwards, I thought about it.

563
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:13,900
I believe Master Nong Jing Sun might 
be the one who helped.

564
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,700
I don't need them anymore.

565
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:34,400
And, I believe my parents don't want
to see these things again, either.

566
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,600
Honorable Father, I have been unfilial.

567
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:45,800
Only now do I understand...
Back then, that moment on the stage...

568
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,400
why you didn't deliver that final blow.

569
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:53,200
You are, indeed, the real "First in Tianjin".

570
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,200
Honorable Mother,

571
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:59,300
You once taught me the principles of being a person.

572
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:03,700
Your son was foolish, and didn't understand.

573
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:11,600
Don't worry.
I, your son, shall not disappoint you again.

574
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:21,050
My child, I didn't take good care of you
when you were in this world.

576
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,900
I even let you suffer such a disasterous fate. 

578
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:32,400
I'm not a good father.

579
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:56,100
Madam, I once did an unforgivable thing.

580
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,800
Today, I've come to pay my respects to Master Qin.

581
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:19,900
Mum! Mum!

582
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,200
Extra! Extra!

583
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:37,400
A foreign strongman named Hercules 
O'Brien has challenged all China!

584
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,200
With 32 consecutive wins,

585
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:44,000
and 25 contestants seriously injured,
He has not yet been defeated...

586
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,100
He scorns the Chinese as the
"Sick Men of the East"!

587
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:51,500
No one dares to challenge him!

588
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,100
Jing Sun...

589
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:57,600
I'm indebted to you.

590
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:03,500
So many times...I only realized 
my mistakes after the fact.

592
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:07,100
My errors have caused so much pain 
in my heart.

593
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:12,800
I don't wish to mention past things.
They're all over and done with.

595
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:23,600
Jing Sun, It's hard for me to ask,
But you're my only hope.

598
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,600
I need to borrow some money.

599
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:31,000
-Still after your fighting competitions?
-Yes.

601
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,400
I don't have a friend like you.

602
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,800
What reason do I have for lending you money?

603
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:28,000
-Master...
-Master Huo, this is from my master.

606
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Your master is...?

607
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,100
His surname is Nong. Nong Jing Sun.

608
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:46,500
1909, Shanghai Racetrack

609
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,400
Ladies and gentlemen...

610
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:02,200
The person appearing before you today

611
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:05,400
can move a train single-handedly,

612
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,600
can put a hole in the Great Wall 
of China with one punch!

613
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:09,700
What bullshit!

614
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,900
He can crush a Chinese 
fighter with his little finger...

615
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:19,000
-Idiot!
-Please welcome the greatest strongman in history...

617
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:24,100
Ao...Bi...Ying! (O'Brien)

618
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:51,700
Today's challenger is...
Tianjin's very own, Huo Yuan Jia!

620
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,400
Good! Good!

621
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:16,000

Tell him: wagering one's life in a fight 

624
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:22,100
is one of China's more questionable traditions.

625
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:26,200
But, we have another kind of tradition,
making friends while exchanging pointers.

627
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:31,000
(Excellent! Well said..)

628
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:37,850
Uh...he wants to kick your butt.

629
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:46,200
Start the competition!

630
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,300
Come on! Yeah!

635
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,100
All right!

636
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,200
-Excellent, well done!
-Boo!

637
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:43,800
I yield kindly.

638
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,500
...Thank you.

Master, someone called for you.

Jing Sun...I really didn't expect you.

648

You still consider me a friend.

649
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,600
I can't forget you as a friend.

650
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,900
I cannot possibly forget.

651
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:19,500
Come, have a seat, Yuan Jia.

652
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,500
I've prepared your favorite wine!

653
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,500
Come!

654
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,500
What's the matter?

655
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,800
I gave up wine. I gave it 
up many years ago.

657
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,000
But wine was like life to you!

658
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:36,500
I don't want to repeat the mistakes
I've made in the past.

659
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,400
Good.

660
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:42,700
Then, we'll drink tea instead.

661
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:54,800
Yuan Jia, you've stirred up the spirits
of our countrymen with that fight.

663
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:57,200
What with the Westerners having
oppressed us to this point,

664
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:00,000
it's about time a Chinese person
stood up to them.

665
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:01,700
As a friend,

666
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,000
I'm truly happy for you.

667
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:05,900
Try this!

668
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,600
Jing Sun,

669
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:15,600
when are you leaving this time?

670
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:19,200
Me? Since I've decided to come,
I'm not leaving. 

671
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:22,400
What about your restaurant?

672
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:25,000
-Sold it.
-Sold?!

674
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:27,000
Your business has always been good, hasn't it?

675
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:32,100
You want to start the Jing Wu Sports Association.
How will you do it without money?

677
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,800
But, the Gu Yue Restaurant meant everything to you...

678
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:41,300
Compared with your aspirations, my restaurant
isn't even worth mentioning.

680
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:45,400
Yuan Jia, I'm not the martial arts type.

681
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:50,900
I can only give you this meager contribution.


682
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,600
May you succeed.

684
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:03,700
This is drafted according to what we've discussed
earlier--the school's rules and regulations.

685
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,500
See if this is what you wanted.

686

The Jing Wu Sports Association
has 3 objectives:

687
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:16,000
To educate the body, wisdom, and morals.
Martial arts is the way to become stronger.

689
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:18,600
There will be no segregration of clans.

690
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:23,000
Only through the exchange of arts
will one improve oneself.

691
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:25,700
By having a healthy body and alert mind,

692
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,500
our people will be able to prosper again.

693
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:33,700
We shall not harm the innocent!
We shall not abuse our martial arts!

694
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:38,500
Virtue and morality will be our motto!
To constantly strive to better ourselves!

695
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,890
"1910, Jing Wu Sports Association officially established"
-Ready!

695
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:49,000
"Shanghai Foreign Chamber of Commerce"

-Well, gentlemen, it's too rich for me.

696
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,400
I only bet on sure things.

696
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:55,750
Then perhaps you'll be interested in joining
our little wager 

697
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:58,600
against this..."Hua Yuan Jia" fellow.

697
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:04,050
He better lose this time. He cost me 
6000 Francs when he beat this O'Brien.

697
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Mr. Mita here will ensure that you win back everything 
that you've lost, plus a litte bit more.

697
01:18:11,100 --> 1:18:16,000
I'm set to stage a competition of four matches, between
our countries' best against him.

697
1:18:16,120 --> 1:18:20,000
We'll beat him, and leave the Chinese with nothing
to brag about.

697
1:18:20,520 --> 1:18:24,000
Four against one? What makes you so sure
he's going to accept that?

697
1:18:24,900 --> 1:18:27,840
Pride. Honor. The prestige of his school.

698
1:18:28,200 --> 1:18:31,810
It's of no importance. He has already 
accepted the challenge.

698
1:18:32,050 --> 1:18:34,800
Then, gentlemen, I'll take you up
on your wager.

698
1:18:35,300 --> 1:18:39,900
And to make it a little more interesting,
I'm gonna back the Chinese. 

698
1:18:40,400 --> 1:18:43,050
You're certain Wong Ji Wah will lose?

698
1:18:43,600 --> 1:18:47,850
With what I have in mind, our victory is guaranteed.


698
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:08,200
Yuan Jia.

699
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:13,650
Among the competitors this time...
There's a Japanese man named Anno Tanaka.

701
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:19,850
He'd like to meet you.
But, I heard that he's a master among masters.

703
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,400
We can only improve by fighting with the best.

704
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:29,300
Yuan Jia, this challenge from the foreigners...
I don't think it's as simple as it looks.

706
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:33,200
If it is, why would they want you
to take on 4 fighters at once?

708
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:37,200
I'm guessing, they want to use 
the chance to wipe the floor with our pride,

709
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:41,400
so that our association will lose its
influence in Shanghai.

710
01:19:41,685 --> 01:19:46,500
Indeed, and we must win all four
matches to conclude the challenge.

712
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,700
It's not fair in any way.

713
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,100
But as long as we live in this world,

714
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:57,000
who can promise that all matters in life are fair?

715
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:01,400
For the Jing Wu Association,

716
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,400
I have no other options.

717
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:04,700
But what if...

718
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:08,000
Jing Sun!

719
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,500
I have something to discuss with you.

720
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,400
What's it about?

721
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,000
After this challenge,

722
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:15,100
I want you to become the school's president.

723
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:18,000
Why?

724
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:21,500
I want to take some time off in the countryside, 
to see Yue Tzi and Aunt Suen.

725
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:24,400
I've made a promise.

726
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:37,700
If Sir says so...do you truly
not understand tea? 

727
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:41,200
Not that I don't understand, 
I'm just unwilling.

728
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:45,600
I don't want to rank the tea.
I'm fine as long as it's tea. 

730
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:51,600
But, tea has differences
in smell, and in grade.

731
01:20:52,999 --> 01:20:55,400
What is good? What is bad?

732
01:20:55,500 --> 01:21:00,800
They all grow in nature,
without rank or distinction.

733
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,500
It seems you still have not understood.

735
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,300
Otherwise, you'd naturally determine a rank
from the first taste.

736
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,100
You are right.

737
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,400
So I realized that

738
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:11,300
the quality of tea

739
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:14,000
is not derived from the tea itself;

740
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,000
it's decided by people.

741
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:18,300
Different people have different choices.

742
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:20,980
Me, I'm unwilling to make this choice.

743
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,100
Oh? Why?

744
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,500
Appreciating tea depends on your emotions.

745
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,800
If you have a happy state of mind,

746
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:30,700
does the quality of tea matter?

747
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,400
Oh, I've never thought of that.

748
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,500
According to Sir, there are numerous 
factions of martial arts;

749
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,400
Is there no superiority or inferiority among them?

750
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:43,910
Yes, those are my sentiments.

751
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:47,800
In that case, Sir, I'd like to 
pose a question to you.

752
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,500
Since there are no distinctions 
between martial arts,

753
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:52,600
why, then, are there competitions?

754
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,500
I meant that all martial arts are equal.

755
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,960
The distinction lies in the strength
or weakness of those who practice them.

756
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,500
Through competitions, we can further improve, 
and discover one's true self.

758
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,500
Because, quite possibly, our real opponent
is ourselves.

760
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,900
Only through competition can one
recognize one's true self.

761
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:20,800
Does Sir mean that the worst battle
is found within one's own heart?

763
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:33,800
I'm honored to be having this conversation with you.

764
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:37,500
Well, today, we met to appreciate tea.

765
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:40,800
Let's not talk further and thus forget about the tea.

766
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:45,000
-Come, try it.
-Yes, the tea.

768
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:54,000
"1910, Shanghai"

769
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,500

01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,400
"The competition's arena..."

771
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:12,600
Esteemed guests,

772
01:23:12,850 --> 01:23:14,200
the last fight of the day...

773
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,900
will be Anno Tanaka of Japan's 
Nine Demon Gods style...

774
01:23:17,150 --> 01:23:20,500
versus the Jing Wu Sports Association's
Huo Yuan Jia.

775
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,500
What's the matter?

776
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:26,800
One versus four?

777
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Why did you not tell me before?

778
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:32,600
We've already discussed this.

780
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,200
You need not be surprised.

781
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,500
Is this a competition?

782
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:41,600
-This is murder!
-You worry needlessly.

784
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,600
Huo Yuan Jia is the king of the arena.

785
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:47,600
Outstanding fighters from all over 
were arranged to meet him today...

787
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:50,000
Ita-san...

788
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:53,100
What are you?

789
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,100
Is this for Japan's honor?

790
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:58,500
Or is it for personal gain?

791
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:04,400
To me, martial arts itself means the most.

792
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:08,500
Your mission is to win this competition.

793
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,400
Begin!

794
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:28,600
Brother Yuan Jia,
this contest is unfair to you.

796
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:34,300
I have no objections
if you choose to fight another day.


797
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,500
I appreciate your good intentions,

798
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:41,400
but since I'm already standing in this arena,
there must be a conclusion.

800
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:43,400
Please!

801
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,600
Begin!

802
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,800
Haha! Excellent!
Master is too good!

804
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:58,000
A draw. 
The next round will be unarmed freestyle combat!

806
01:26:58,150 --> 01:27:02,100
Both sides, please prepare yourselves...

807
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,200
Mita, where have you been?
We're going to lose.

808
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,420
Don't worry, gentlemen. 
I have it under control.

811
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:05,100
Yuan Jia!

812
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:18,720
-Stop!
-What happened?

814
01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:23,200
Tanaka, why are you stopping?

815
01:28:23,550 --> 01:28:24,790
Yuan Jia!

816
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:27,500
-Tanaka!
-Go down, go!

817
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:35,000
Yuan Jia, what's wrong?

818
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:37,000
How are you?

819
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,000
-I've been poisoned...
-Poisoned?!

820
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:40,100
How can it be?

821
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:42,200
Just exactly what happened?

822
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:44,400
-What are you doing?
-Water!

823
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:45,700
Your cup!

824
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:47,300
What happened to your drink?

825
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,900
The drink's poisoned!

826
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:53,200
They've already removed the evidence!
Yuan Jia, let's go to the hospital!

828
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:54,600
Master, we'll go to the hospital.

829
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,900
I've over-exerted myself...

830
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:03,600
-Too late...the poison is making its way to my heart...
-Master, I'll avenge you!

832
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:13,100
Zhen Sheng!
What you must do...is not seek revenge. 

834
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:19,000
Hatred...will only beget more hatred.

835
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:23,100
I don't want to see hatred.

836
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:28,100
-What's important is the strengthening of oneself.
-Yuan Jia!

837
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:30,400
-Master!
-Yuan Jia, let's stop the fight.

839
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:36,990
-I'll take you to the hospital, let's go!
-Jing Sun...

841
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:40,730
I'm just a brute fighter.

842
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:46,900
It took me many years...to truly
understand what martial arts is...

843
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:53,100
and what I have done with it?
This competition isn't finished yet...

845
01:29:53,890 --> 01:29:58,200
We cannot choose the way life begins...

846
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:04,700
but we must have the courage 
to walk that last step.

847
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:09,900
Master...

848
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,500
-What is this? What are you doing?
-What do you mean?

850
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:16,400
You ask too many questions!

851
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,300
(I must win this fight.)
Just win the competition!

852
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:39,200
Never cease to improve oneself!

852
01:30:39,990 --> 01:30:42,890
See for yourself...

856
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,600
Don't keep fighting.

857
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,900
Staying alive 
is more important than anything!

858
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:16,500
Listen.
Living...isn't just for one person.

859
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:22,700
If we must fight...I will not hold back.

860
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,990
This will be my honor.

861
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:23,800
Master...

862
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:32,200
He's down! Huo Yuan Jia is down!
Go! He lost! Go! Go! Make the announcement!

865
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,400
Wait!

866
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:02,400
Huo!

867
01:34:02,925 --> 01:34:03,600
Yuan!

868
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:04,900
Jia!

869
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:06,300
Yuan Jia!

870
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:09,800
Huo Yuan Jia...
Huo Yuan Jia...

871
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:11,300
Master!


874
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:30,100
Tanaka! Look what you've done!

876
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,000
-I lost!
-Says who? Witnessed by who?!

878
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,900
I saw it myself.

879
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:38,500
-I've lost by virtue of martial art ethics!
-Who are you to decide?!

881
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:43,200
How can you make decisions just like that?!

882
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:51,820
You...

883
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:55,900
You're an embarrassment to Japan!

884
01:36:55,300 --> 01:37:01,500
Huo Yuan Jia died from the poison shortly after 
arriving at the hospital. He was only 42 years old.

885
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,740
After his death, his teachings have 
continued to flourish. 

886
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:09,500
To date, the Jing Wu Association has
expanded to over 50 countries all over the world.

887
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:13,100
Dr. Sun Yat-Sen penned these words 
in memory of Huo Yuan Jia's spirit:

888
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:18,100
"Essence of learning martial arts"

889
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:21,100
