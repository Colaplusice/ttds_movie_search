That beer is good, ah?

00:03:08.24,00:03:12.05

00:03:12.78,00:03:18.65
- If you want, i can make a detour to Miramar to visit your little girlfriend[br]- "little girlfriend"

00:03:19.04,00:03:20.70
A couple of days

00:03:23.01,00:03:26.79
- Look Fuser, look at that guy over there[br]- What?

00:03:27.36,00:03:29.13
Do you want your life to be like that?

00:03:30.77,00:03:32.86
You don't want your life to be like that, Fuser

00:03:33.90,00:03:36.16
What you want is to fuck in every country in South America

00:03:36.31,00:03:40.85
Hey boy...and in every town if we are lucky enough[br]That's and extra ingredient, right

00:03:41.04,00:03:46.32
What we had in common: our restlessness, our dreaming spirit

and the untiring love for the route

00:03:49.85,00:03:51.67
BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA[br]January 4th, 1952[br]Km 0

00:03:52.33,00:03:55.03
Let's go Ernestito, we don't have the whole day

00:03:55.59,00:04:00.05
- Isn't it too much Granado?[br]- Not enough chief.  Norton 500, "this" is a motorcycle

00:04:00.22,00:04:03.14
Your son is in good wheels, don't worry

00:04:08.32,00:04:10.95
You should expect some difficult times son

00:04:11.50,00:04:14.65
But the truth is that i always dreamed of doing something like this

00:04:14.91,00:04:19.79
And i have to confess that if i had a couple less years on me...[br]I would jump right along with you on that motorcycle

00:04:19.98,00:04:21.73
Try to think that i do it for the both of us

00:04:21.74,00:04:25.19
- 10 years planning this trip, uncle[br]- Since you were a kid

00:04:25.25,00:04:29.16
Meanwhile...I trust you eh?

00:04:30.96,00:04:32.47
And the revolution uncle, for when?

00:04:32.46,00:04:34.95
Here? In a century

00:04:37.65,00:04:40.19
- Are you already leaving?[br]- Yes, Im off

00:04:42.45,00:04:46.86
You should only worry about taking your medicines, nothing more, ok?

00:04:48.08,00:04:48.92
And writing me...

00:04:49.23,00:04:52.48
The most beautiful letters you have ever read mom

00:04:52.69,00:04:55.03
- Bye, my love[br]- You'll see. Bye. I love you

00:04:59.35,00:04:59.90
Bye

00:05:01.44,00:05:03.77
Bye little sister, take care

00:05:04.20,00:05:06.01
Bye man

00:05:15.06,00:05:16.27
Send me postcards

00:05:16.28,00:05:19.07
Ok, stop it or Ill start crying. Please

00:05:19.20,00:05:20.63
Take care, ok?

00:05:21.49,00:05:25.14
Just like Don Quixote had Rocinante and Saint Martin had his mule

00:05:25.40,00:05:27.03
We have "La Poderosa"

00:05:27.04,00:05:32.03
- Yeah, that pisses oil[br]- Yes, pisses oil, but what Im trying to say is that[br]in this precise moment

00:05:32.10,00:05:37.39
The young Fuser and myself are embarking in a trip[br]to the most remote places of the human spirit

00:05:37.64,00:05:41.44
where we will meet new lands, listen to new anthems, eat new fruits...

00:05:41.52,00:05:47.29
Granado...Im making you responsible. If something happens to Ernesto Ill find you.[br]Put on the handkerchief darling

00:05:47.98,00:05:50.93
Don't worry mam, he will come back to become[br]the doctor we all want him to be

00:05:50.95,00:05:52.28
It better be

00:05:52.61,00:05:54.40
Ok, is time to leave!

00:06:14.00,00:06:15.48
Animal!

00:06:21.35,00:06:23.07
Careful with that bike!

00:06:36.80,00:06:39.89
Dear mom...Buenos Aires is behind us

00:06:40.71,00:06:42.17
behind is as also the miserable life

00:06:42.47,00:06:45.10
the faculty, the exams and the dissertations that make you sleepy

00:06:46.69,00:06:48.87
Before us lies all of Latin America

00:06:50.37,00:06:52.13
From now on we will only trust in "La Poderosa"

00:07:14.27,00:07:19.66
I wish you could see us. We look like adventurers[br]and inspire admiration and envy everywhere

00:07:33.06,00:07:36.19
Go Mial. Assume aerodynamic road position

00:07:37.09,00:07:40.05
C'mon baby, don't fail me baby.[br]C'mon, c'mon

00:07:41.45,00:07:43.28
What happened Mial?!

00:07:51.12,00:07:56.45
I'm glad to have left behind civilization, and be closer to the earth

00:07:58.17,00:08:01.69
Wait, something is coming out...something is coming out

00:08:07.08,00:08:08.85
Fuser, are you alright?

00:08:12.36,00:08:13.98
What happened puppy?

00:08:20.29,00:08:21.07
Are you alright?

00:08:22.53,00:08:25.40
- What the fuck is that?[br]- What the fuck does it look like?

00:08:25.73,00:08:28.44
- A fucking dog?![br]-  Oh fuck, you are a shitty driver...

00:08:28.79,00:08:31.13
What the fuck is that dog doing on the bike?

00:08:31.41,00:08:33.34
Is for Chichina and his name is Kamba

00:08:36.81,00:08:38.00
Pick up the bike.

00:08:49.11,00:08:53.75
Miramar, Argentina[br]January 13th, 1952[br]Km 601

00:08:57.54,00:08:59.24
Where the fuck are we? Switzerland?

00:09:04.31,00:09:06.73
- Good morning[br]- Good morning

00:09:07.07,00:09:09.43
- Chichina?[br]- She's inside with the rest of the family

00:09:11.42,00:09:12.63
That bike is giving you problems, uh?

00:09:16.34,00:09:18.57
Esteban, please tell us about your trip

00:09:19.02,00:09:23.17
It was great Don Horacio,[br]i had the opportunity to take a seminar in Cambridge

00:09:24.40,00:09:27.42
and stay a couple of weeks in London,[br]a fascinating city

00:09:27.51,00:09:30.44

00:09:30.96,00:09:33.61

00:09:38.16,00:09:39.32
Ah, law

00:10:16.87,00:10:18.20
Sorry.

00:10:37.12,00:10:39.15
1, 2, 3, 4

00:10:40.80,00:10:42.07
Is your turn, come

00:10:42.65,00:10:44.57
I never saw a pig who wanted to dance, never.

00:10:46.71,00:10:47.67
C'mon

00:10:48.40,00:10:49.35
Knock it off!

00:10:51.62,00:10:58.58
- With this hand...back...side[br]- What are you laughing at?[br]- I'm laughing at you.

00:11:05.99,00:11:07.75
Tonight?

00:11:08.15,00:11:10.88
My dad ask aunt Roxanna not to take her eyes off of me

00:11:11.24,00:11:16.10
My mom promised the Lady of the Valley that she would[br]walk to her sanctuary if we broke up

00:11:17.56,00:11:23.22
And your parents can't see that the more they bury the diamonds,[br]the more decided is the pirate to steal them?

00:11:24.58,00:11:28.38
Believe me, this diamond wouldn't mind being stolen

00:11:31.97,00:11:33.26
Dance

00:11:40.41,00:11:41.40
Look

00:11:53.22,00:11:54.73
Let me see your bathroom

00:11:59.64,00:12:01.54
- Good night[br]- Good night ladies

00:12:09.02,00:12:13.53
Aunt Roxanna, which room is mine?

00:12:24.69,00:12:26.51
Get away Kamba!

00:13:10.74,00:13:15.35
- How many days did you say we were staying here?[br]- You already know[br]- Two

00:13:16.10,00:13:21.58
- And how many days have we been here?[br]- If you become a Doctor, will you operate with wire too?[br]- Six days, Fuser

00:13:25.96,00:13:27.35
Someone will see us

00:13:45.74,00:13:49.37
If you'd stay we could do many things, Ernesto,[br]but only if you'd stay

00:13:53.22,00:13:54.61
I didn't like the sound of that

00:13:55.08,00:14:00.55
- What do you want me to say? That Im going to wait for you?[br]- I told you Im coming back

00:14:02.12,00:14:05.45
- Yes, i have the dog as proof[br]- You didn't like it?

00:14:07.90,00:14:15.97
What do you want Ernesto, what do you want to hear?[br]That Im going to wait forever,[br]that Ill wait for months and months till you come back?

00:14:21.07,00:14:26.52
- What's going on?[br]- What do you want? What do you want?

00:14:29.15,00:14:32.27
I'd like you to stay like this forever. Quiet.

00:14:35.32,00:14:38.69
I want to look at you, cause Im not going[br]to see you for a long time

00:14:47.43,00:14:51.79
Of course Im going to wait for you,[br]but please don't take an eternity

00:14:56.23,00:15:00.76
- And how long is an eternity?[br]- That's slippery ground mister

00:15:07.22,00:15:08.93
I'm not going to touch you

00:15:14.26,00:15:22.81
Did i hit you? Did i hurt you? Did i hurt you?[br]That was a trick, a very bad trick

00:15:23.30,00:15:27.57
Ok lovebirds...is time to leave.[br]Fuser

00:15:30.45,00:15:34.95
Miss Ferreira...[br]Thanks for everything

00:15:54.61,00:16:00.02
"I used to listen the bare feet splashing in the ship[br]"And had a feeling of the faces darkened by hunger

00:16:01.22,00:16:03.73
"My heart was a pendulum between her and the street

00:16:05.02,00:16:09.37
"I don't know with what strength i freed myself from her eyes,[br]"I broke away from her arms

00:16:09.72,00:16:13.02
"She was left clouding with tears her anguish[br]"Behind the rain and the glass

00:16:13.85,00:16:15.43
- Lorca eh?[br]- No

00:16:15.83,00:16:17.79

00:16:18.00,00:16:21.68

And so...with Chichina, nothing...

00:17:04.44,00:17:08.18
Not even after giving her the German shepherd with pedigree...nothing

00:17:09.56,00:17:12.11
I mean, at least you saw a tit...one

00:17:15.81,00:17:18.74
Ahhh....You saw her tits, Ernesto

00:17:19.60,00:17:23.11

- No...[br]- Protein food

00:17:36.79,00:17:41.77
No, she gave me this money for when we get to the US.[br]She asked me to buy her some pants.

00:17:43.82,00:17:45.46
I told her i would

00:17:46.39,00:17:49.69

00:17:50.26,00:17:55.00
- Fucking moron, he is testing me...[br]-  Che are you talking to the bike again

00:17:55.24,00:17:58.91
Listen to me man, what is wrong with your head?[br]That chick's got you by the balls.

00:17:59.68,00:18:02.25

00:18:42.10,00:18:43.41
It was the curve

00:18:45.53,00:18:46.40
Son of a...

00:18:50.52,00:18:52.94
Look at the pipe...[br]son of a bitch!

00:19:32.88,00:19:39.17
- Che and what if we go there?[br]- We should ask for help over here, with the common people

00:19:44.26,00:19:48.90
- Which one are we doing? The broken headlight?[br]- No, Red October. You have the experience right?

00:19:53.90,00:19:55.13
Good Night

00:19:56.81,00:19:57.85
What do you want

00:19:58.13,00:20:04.81
Maybe our appearance doesn't show it, but we are doctors[br]from Buenos Aires and Crdoba, respectively

00:20:05.34,00:20:17.89
We are traveling all over the country, doing some research[br]with hopes of curing some of the worst diseases of the 20th century

00:20:18.10,00:20:23.58
Plagues that not only consume our energy but that also[br]keeps Argentina in need

00:20:23.91,00:20:27.95
When by just reading the medical literature, you could notice, just as us...

00:20:28.19,00:20:31.89
What the fuck do you want, pair of bums?

00:20:33.60,00:20:39.21
Look sir, the wind took our tent, we are starving[br]and we need a place to spend the night

00:20:39.85,00:20:46.09
Ok, out there in the shed there's a good ground.[br]You can sleep with the workers

00:20:46.33,00:20:55.94
- We are doctors...[br]- Hmm...i like your face a lot, but i don't like yours fatty

00:20:58.15,00:21:00.32
- Fine?[br]- Yes, its fine[br]- Thank you.

00:21:14.37,00:21:21.89
Dear Mom...we are still hitting the road,[br]but to tell you the truth, the bike is less powerful every day

00:21:27.16,00:21:31.20
San Martn de los Andes, Argentina[br]January 31st, 1952[br]Km 2051

00:21:32.90,00:21:39.13
Money and food are scarce, but we manage to find opportunities[br]to eat and sleep for free

00:21:41.76,00:21:45.16
Thanks to our secret weapon:[br]Alberto's infallible sweet talking

00:21:45.19,00:21:49.46
...plagues that not only consume our energy but compromise[br]the modernization of Argentina

00:21:49.59,00:21:59.27
- So, you are doctors[br]- Well, no. Alberto is a biochemist and I am an MD student[br]- He is practically graduated, we are like doctors

00:21:59.27,00:22:05.30
- Then i would appreciate it if you could look at a swelling i have in the neck[br]- Gladly, eh...Mr.?

00:22:05.31,00:22:06.27
Von Puttkamer

00:22:11.57,00:22:12.60
Does it hurt?

00:22:16.50,00:22:19.32
- This is a tumor[br]- What do you mean a tumor?[br]- Yes

00:22:21.17,00:22:24.49
- Do you think so[br]- Yes[br]- Allow me

00:22:27.17,00:22:31.28
I don't know Fuser, fat sedimentation[br]it could be a cyst

00:22:31.58,00:22:37.53
No.  It is a tumor in the occipital area

00:22:38.13,00:22:41.78
- Schatzie, these gentlemen say i have a tumor[br]- Tumor?

00:22:42.15,00:22:47.19
Good morning mam, i sincerely don't believe it is a tumor[br]but a sebaceous cyst

00:22:47.36,00:22:50.46
If you could give us a place where we could[br]eat and sleep we might be able to treat it

00:22:50.51,00:22:56.69
No, no look...we can't treat it. You will have to go[br]to Buenos Aires. I can recommend you a specialist

00:22:57.02,00:23:02.61
- Or we could try to help him, don't you think?[br]- Help with what? With the grass, with prayers?

00:23:02.73,00:23:08.34
- I understand, you can't do anything for me[br]- Yes we can, if you give us a place where we could eat and sleep.

00:23:09.09,00:23:18.19
- Around here there's a lake with lots of fish and a shed[br]- Sir, the diagnostic is very...[br]- We have nothing more to talk about, doctors. Let's go Schatzie

00:23:22.50,00:23:28.85
- The next time could you try to help us a little[br]- Of course i can give you a hand, but never at the price of the health of a man

00:23:29.13,00:23:34.17
- Ok, let's say that you are right and the old guy has a tumor,[br]how the fuck do you tell him like that?

00:23:34.43,00:23:37.20
Is the truth, if he can't handle it he can go to hell

00:23:37.20,00:23:42.73
- You can't treat a patient like that, you can't[br]- The guy has a serious problem,[br]the sooner he looks into it the better

00:23:43.40,00:23:46.78
That's the proper treatment, didn't they teach you that[br]at biochemistry school?

00:23:49.58,00:23:52.15
Don't talk to me about proper medicine

00:23:53.08,00:23:57.25
Nurse. First graduate and then talk.[br]You think you know everything, moron

00:23:57.93,00:23:59.51
I'm going to look for food

00:24:00.22,00:24:03.11
Duck! duck! duck!. Give me gun, move it! move it!

00:24:04.65,00:24:06.09
Son of a...

00:24:11.24,00:24:12.38
Great Mial...

00:24:12.62,00:24:13.60
I hit it, man

00:24:15.14,00:24:17.25
- How did you do it?[br]- I can't fucking believe it...

00:24:18.01,00:24:24.54
Well, there's no other choice but to get in the water[br]and pick up dinner, no?  Fuser, to the water to get the food!

00:24:24.65,00:24:27.54
You are really crazy if you think Im going to get in there.[br]Do you know how cold is that water?

00:24:27.55,00:24:36.10
Yes, i know you are allergic to cold, water, hot and all that[br]but you know what, i am older, wiser and i shot the duck, so[br]you have to go

00:24:36.22,00:24:39.90
- That shot came out of your ass, besides i have asthma[br]- Ok, you are right. If you can't Ill do it

00:24:41.63,00:24:44.77
- I didn't say i couldn't[br]- You can't or you don't want to[br]- I didn't say that i couldn't

00:24:45.37,00:24:49.13
Or you don't want to and that is the same. Or you could give[br]me Chichina's fifteen bucks...

00:24:50.14,00:24:52.35
...and we eat as God intended, c'mon.

00:24:52.72,00:24:56.41
- Look if i get to find that fucking duck, Ill eat it all by myself[br]- Ah! in the water, in the water, duck.

00:24:59.01,00:25:02.80
- I'm going to get my balls frozen[br]- For the use you give them, Fuser...

00:25:07.22,00:25:14.63
Good Fuser, good...bring on that duck with potatoes.[br]Is it cold Fuser? Hey! cold? Not over here.

00:25:17.86,00:25:18.74
Duck

00:25:22.78,00:25:27.05
- Are you feeling sick?[br]- No, Im just perfect

00:25:29.61,00:25:33.79
Bariloche Train Station, Argentina[br]3 days later[br]Km 2270

00:25:40.37,00:25:43.15
Easy

00:25:43.53,00:25:45.22
Fuser...

00:26:05.00,00:26:10.90
Fuser, listen to me. Give me Chichina's fifteen dollars and let's[br]go to a hospital like the people

00:26:12.36,00:26:15.35
If you say that to me again, Ill throw up all over you.

00:26:59.08,00:27:06.92
Dear mom...what is it that's lost when you cross a border.[br]Each moment seems to be split in two

00:27:07.15,00:27:14.12
Melancholy for what was left behind and on the[br]other hand all the enthusiasm at entering new lands

00:27:14.85,00:27:17.30
Frias Lake, Argentina[br]February 15th, 1952[br]Km 2306

00:27:17.61,00:27:23.50
- Look Mial, Chile[br]- Chile! Viva Chile!

00:27:25.71,00:27:29.62
- Is it your first time out of the country?[br]- Yes, of course

00:27:29.72,00:27:31.53
You are almost a man, Che

00:27:33.68,00:27:40.79
Look Mial, when we are old and tired of traveling, we[br]should come back and set a clinic on this lake

00:27:43.23,00:27:44.91
That's a good idea

00:27:45.24,00:27:47.90
Providing attention to everybody, if anyone ever comes

00:27:48.15,00:27:50.23
Count on me, brother

00:27:50.93,00:27:53.60
Hey, things are getting better Fuser, eh?[br]- Yeah

00:27:55.08,00:27:58.86
- Hey, it is snowing[br]- No, is just frost

00:28:20.44,00:28:27.32
- Help me[br]- On three, 1, 2, 3[br]- Done

00:28:36.29,00:28:38.25
Go, go, go

00:28:43.80,00:28:48.50
- Fuck is cold![br]- Some summer, uh

00:29:05.75,00:29:09.16
Che, you told me we would enter Chile like two conquerors.[br]Not on foot like a pair of losers

00:29:09.19,00:29:11.27

00:29:12.40,00:29:14.32
What if we dump this shit that gives us so much trouble

00:29:15.02,00:29:17.41
And go on foot through the whole continent, you genius

00:29:17.99,00:29:23.36
Yes, we would see more and meet more people...[br]you would lose weight

00:29:24.14,00:29:27.12
You sissy, but if with a couple of dollars from[br]Chichina this gets fixed immediately

00:29:27.41,00:29:29.62
And again with the same thing. Forget about that money

00:29:31.42,00:29:36.19
Ok, perfect. If you get that mad then go all the way to Venezuela[br]walking and leave me here alone with the boss's money

00:29:36.66,00:29:40.39
Know what? I would get there in half the time and stop[br]meddling with other people business

00:30:02.42,00:30:03.74
You know what your problem is?

00:30:04.42,00:30:07.19
Your fucking honesty.

00:30:07.31,00:30:10.15
You should tell a lie from now and then to help us.

00:30:14.25,00:30:17.92
- Hold it for a second

00:30:18.16,00:30:23.26

- Excuse me, what's your name?[br]- Teresa[br]- Teresa, Ernesto, nice to meet you

00:30:44.62,00:30:48.86

00:30:49.18,00:30:54.94
-You are traveling?[br]- Yes we are traveling, we are the owners of that old bike[br]- A the big one over there

00:30:55.21,00:30:57.32

00:31:29.55,00:31:34.53
- Dr. Alberto Granados from Crdoba[br]- What do you mean "Granados"[br]- That's what it says

00:31:35.34,00:31:39.91
Dr. Alberto Granados from Crdoba and[br]Dr. Ernesto Guevara de la Serna from Buenos Aires

00:31:40.03,00:31:43.72
They have embarked on an epic trip from their[br]homeland to the north point of Venezuela

00:31:44.10,00:31:51.56
The charismatic adventurer scientists, experts in their field,[br]have treated three thousand patients in all the continent.

00:31:53.58,00:32:01.46
They hope to complete their trip in a record time of[br]five months, just in time to celebrate the 30th birthday[br]of the youthful Dr. Granados

00:32:01.79,00:32:04.86
- It says youthful, eh?[br]-  Yes, and so i get informed too.

00:32:05.80,00:32:06.89
Do you think it will work?

00:32:19.47,00:32:21.69
Hello, good evening

00:32:23.14,00:32:30.22
My friend and i  have some problems with our bike[br]The direction is broken, the brakes are practically gone[br]and the shift box as always...

00:32:30.56,00:32:32.34
And my backside is killing me...

00:32:32.71,00:32:36.19
Let's see. I can fix the direction, the brakes and the shift box.

00:32:36.77,00:32:39.69
But i can't do anything about your backside.

00:32:41.68,00:32:42.90
We don't have any money

00:32:44.68,00:32:47.92
What? You don't have any money?

00:32:48.22,00:32:52.08
When we get to Valparaiso we will receive some money,[br]when we have it we will send it to you...

00:32:52.35,00:32:56.67
You know, i wouldn't want to be rude, but if you[br]don't have any money,[br]you have nothing to do here, so please...

00:32:56.71,00:33:04.11
Excuse me the interruption, but if you help us right now you will[br]contribute to the bilateral relationships between our countries

00:33:04.20,00:33:06.49
If i understand correctly, you want me to fix it for free

00:33:06.68,00:33:08.15
I think we are not making ourselves clear

00:33:08.54,00:33:12.61
besides we can't expect everybody to know[br]who's who in the Latin-American medicine field

00:33:12.77,00:33:19.43
- Please doctor, come on in[br]- Yes, precisely today there was an article[br]published on the paper...

00:33:28.32,00:33:30.38
- Let me see...allow me[br]- Yes of course

00:33:35.63,00:33:40.85
- Look Piedad, Tulio look...

00:33:41.50,00:33:44.40
- Well the picture is not very good[br]- Yes we are not favorably depicted

00:33:44.72,00:33:47.07
Look, is them...

00:33:49.44,00:33:55.08
Gentlemen, for me it will be a great honor to fix your bike,[br]once i finish this card game with my wife

00:33:55.58,00:33:57.20
Of course, there's no problem

00:33:57.24,00:33:58.55
That's the main priority.

00:34:00.06,00:34:05.09
Do you know that tonight there's a dance[br]and God willing, all the ladies of the town will be there

00:34:05.11,00:34:05.81
Oh, what a shame.

00:34:07.12,00:34:08.70
- Could you give me the paper back?[br]- Thanks a lot, you are very kind

00:34:08.90,00:34:10.95
- I'll bring the bike over[br]- Please bring it over, we will fix it

00:34:26.81,00:34:28.78
Could i have this dance?

00:34:36.49,00:34:39.71
Cheers!

00:35:22.97,00:35:24.97
You know, i was just thinking about you

00:35:27.21,00:35:28.23
And why is that?

00:35:30.15,00:35:32.29
You made quite an impression when i met you

00:35:36.96,00:35:38.24
Thanks

00:35:43.56,00:35:46.33
- Would you like to dance?[br]- No

00:35:47.68,00:35:49.08
I don't dance

00:35:50.44,00:35:56.08
My husband fell asleep, he's drunk.[br]I don't have a dance partner

00:35:57.70,00:36:01.75
Well, if you teach me, yes?

00:36:18.57,00:36:21.26
Hey, you finally remembered that you are a man?

00:36:22.38,00:36:23.38
You had forgotten?

00:36:25.00,00:36:29.83
It's been a long time since i danced,[br]but is coming back to me, is coming back...

00:36:42.37,00:36:43.39
I can't dance here

00:36:48.80,00:36:49.85
Would you like to keep dancing?

00:36:52.32,00:36:53.83
Wouldn't you prefer to go out

00:36:55.91,00:36:57.10
I would love to, yes

00:36:59.41,00:37:00.77
Let's go

00:37:04.89,00:37:06.94
- What's going on?[br]- No, we better stay

00:37:09.84,00:37:10.75
Let me go!

00:37:12.12,00:37:14.32
The Argentinean is leaving with your wife

00:37:14.46,00:37:15.77
Let me go!

00:37:15.88,00:37:17.55
Sorry, sorry...Im sorry

00:37:17.42,00:37:19.12
Argentinean mother fucker!!

00:38:08.78,00:38:10.04
Aren't you tired?

00:38:10.36,00:38:11.26
No

00:38:11.67,00:38:13.91
- Don't you want to switch?[br]- No

00:38:14.28,00:38:15.47
Are you sure?

00:38:31.83,00:38:34.04
Cows! cows!

00:38:35.76,00:38:37.17
I can't Stop, I can't stop!

00:38:37.91,00:38:39.17
The brakes don't work

00:38:39.65,00:38:40.61
Fucking mechanic

00:38:56.22,00:38:58.62
- Are you ok?[br]- Perfect, what do you want me to tell you Fuser?

00:39:06.10,00:39:07.23
Shitty mechanic

00:39:38.17,00:39:40.14
Is he your father?

00:39:41.70,00:39:42.96
Yes

00:39:49.18,00:39:51.04
Hey, that cow is going blind

00:39:54.43,00:39:56.07
...for the shit it's going to see

00:40:09.05,00:40:12.46
Los Angeles, Chile[br]February 26th, 1952[br]Km 2940

00:40:17.24,00:40:19.09
We are 25 days behind

00:40:23.65,00:40:25.65
Wait wait wait wait

00:40:29.04,00:40:30.20
Hello

00:40:30.95,00:40:34.22
There's a rumor that the Chilean women are the most[br]daring in all the continent

00:40:34.25,00:40:38.34
Well, the rumors have no scientific support Dr. Granado.[br]We have to make a field test

00:40:41.20,00:40:42.07
You didn't like them, really?

00:40:44.75,00:40:45.53
Here they come

00:40:50.26,00:40:51.31
Hello girls

00:40:51.71,00:40:53.21
- Excuse us, the place is packed...

00:40:53.25,00:40:57.72
- Can we sit with you?[br]- Yes, of course[br]- Thanks

00:40:59.87,00:41:01.98
- How are you?...Ernesto[br]- He is Alberto

00:41:03.56,00:41:04.77
- Miss?[br]- Jazmn

00:41:05.03,00:41:05.86
Daniela

00:41:06.51,00:41:07.91
- Nice to meet you[br]- Nice to meet you

00:41:09.09,00:41:11.72
- So are you Argentineans?[br]- How did you know?

00:41:12.49,00:41:16.15
I don't know...the accent,[br]because you say "Che", i don't know

00:41:16.44,00:41:18.72
- Had you noticed that Che? i hadn't[br]- No me neither

00:41:22.10,00:41:25.02
- Do you know what day is today?[br]- February 26th

00:41:25.87,00:41:31.94
February 26th...we are going to seem like liars,[br]but it has been a year...

00:41:32.18,00:41:33.77
A year? A year since when?

00:41:34.15,00:41:37.48
- A year since we started this trip[br]- That's nice

00:41:37.87,00:41:44.09
- Damn, one year and we don't have one cent to celebrate[br]- Wouldn't you like us to invite you a bottle of wine?

00:41:44.60,00:41:45.98
- Wine?[br]- Yes...

00:41:46.44,00:41:53.24
Lucho, bring a bottle of wine to our Argentinean visitors that[br]have made such an effort

00:41:53.75,00:41:58.25
But ladies, please don't takes this the wrong way,[br]but i can't drink wine

00:41:58.59,00:42:01.32
- But why, why can't you drink a little wine to celebrate?[br]- Exactly...

00:42:01.94,00:42:07.21
- Well there is an old tradition in Argentina that...[br]- Please c'mon, don't...[br]- What?

00:42:07.43,00:42:10.79
- I think they deserve and explanation[br]- Is adequate, yes

00:42:11.95,00:42:20.48
Thanks Lucho...Well, there is a long costume in Argentina[br]that doesn't allow us to drink with empty stomachs

00:42:20.90,00:42:27.57
And since we don't have any money at the moment, we can't[br]buy food and we must reject your generous offer

00:42:29.79,00:42:38.61
Please, don't be like that...wait.[br]Lucho, could you bring us some empanadas

00:42:38.87,00:42:41.00
- Do you like Chilean empanadas?[br]- I have never tried them

00:42:41.28,00:42:44.31
- four, eight?[br]- They are really hungry.  Twelve.

00:42:46.42,00:42:47.30
I've always liked that number

00:42:47.40,00:42:52.51
- I would really like to stay here[br]- Too bad we don't have a place to stay,[br]but we can sleep at the plaza

00:42:53.25,00:43:00.20
Hey, but my father loves Argentineans.[br]I think he can help you

00:43:01.44,00:43:03.78
He is the chief of the fire department,[br]so he knows a lot of people

00:43:03.82,00:43:06.36
Wait, are you sisters?

00:43:06.65,00:43:09.65
Yes, of course, you hadn't noticed? Look...

00:43:10.43,00:43:11.31
They hadn't noticed.

00:43:12.47,00:43:15.34
- The mechanic doesn't come back until tomorrow,[br]but the bike can stay here

00:43:15.34,00:43:16.34
- Thanks a lot

00:43:17.52,00:43:23.40
Guys, let me introduce you to two Argentinean volunteers[br]that will be staying here with you

00:43:23.84,00:43:30.53
- Let me introduce you to Dr. Che Skinny and Dr. Che Fatty[br]- Nice to meet you

00:43:30.78,00:43:33.58
- Hey, would you like to see more of the town?[br]- Yes

00:43:34.50,00:43:36.46
- But...[br]- Don't worry sir

00:43:36.82,00:43:39.22
- Excuse me...[br]- Yes?

00:43:42.84,00:43:45.32
I wouldn't like to bother you, but are you really doctors?

00:43:45.41,00:43:47.41
- No[br]- Yes[br]- No

00:43:47.76,00:43:48.87
I'm a biochemist

00:43:49.22,00:43:52.57
- Could you visit a lady that is sick[br]- Yes, when you tell me...

00:43:53.34,00:43:57.03
Could it be right now, cause she is really sick.[br]It's been a very long time since she saw a doctor

00:43:57.60,00:44:00.59
Ok, let me pick up my things and we will go.

00:44:01.04,00:44:03.63
Is nice to be faithful to the Hippocratic oath, Fuser

00:44:10.40,00:44:11.52
Excuse me

00:44:18.21,00:44:19.40
Look at my eyes

00:44:27.38,00:44:28.59
I'm going to touch your neck a little

00:44:37.32,00:44:38.65
Has she eaten?

00:44:40.55,00:44:41.51
I don't know

00:45:09.72,00:45:11.90
Look, Doa Rosa, Im going to leave you these pills

00:45:14.07,00:45:15.76
Take one with each meal

00:45:17.11,00:45:18.59
And one before bedtime.

00:45:19.87,00:45:22.02
This will help you feel better

00:45:29.75,00:45:35.37
Dear mom...I knew i wouldn't be able to help that poor woman

00:45:35.54,00:45:39.18
That up to a month ago she had been serving[br]tables, panting like me

00:45:39.79,00:45:41.48
Trying to live with dignity

00:45:43.40,00:45:47.39
In those dying eyes, there was a humble[br]request for excuses

00:45:48.01,00:45:52.72
And a desperate plea of consolation[br]that gets lost in the emptiness

00:45:53.32,00:45:59.31
Just as her body will get lost very soon[br]in the magnitude of the mystery that surrounds us

00:46:05.94,00:46:10.97
Fuser, you still haven't asked me how was the[br]field test with the Chilean sisters

00:46:11.91,00:46:15.70
You know how i fear that you might become[br]the new sexual ambassador of Argentina

00:46:16.94,00:46:19.48
Are you the two lazy asses that travel[br]on that piece of crap

00:46:20.80,00:46:22.90
Her name is "La Poderosa"

00:46:23.33,00:46:27.86
It was. But now we could name it The Dead One, The Paraplegic

00:46:27.99,00:46:29.20
Oh yeah, why?

00:46:29.95,00:46:32.64
What do you mean why? Because Im[br]the mechanic, what else

00:46:32.72,00:46:38.49
If you sell it per pound, you might obtain something,[br]but that piece of crap arrived dead here, really

00:46:53.80,00:46:55.60
I'll be missing you Negra

00:47:04.28,00:47:06.22
I'll take these, let's go

00:47:13.12,00:47:14.67
What do we do? Should we go on?

00:47:15.43,00:47:19.32
Yes, we go on.[br]You only reach 30 once in a lifetime

00:47:27.32,00:47:29.67
You are really something[br]Ernesto Guevara de la Serna

00:47:30.49,00:47:34.57
- If we change the dollars...[br]- No, don't even think about it

00:48:14.24,00:48:16.11
We arrived at Valparaiso

00:48:17.46,00:48:22.46
"I love Valparaiso. How much you encompass[br]and how much you irradiate bride of the ocean"

00:48:23.24,00:48:25.42
"Even far away from your deaf halo..."

00:48:25.51,00:48:28.88
- Federico Garca Lorca[br]- No[br]- No, it's Neruda

00:48:31.66,00:48:35.10
Valparaso, Chile[br]March 7th, 1952[br]Km 3573

00:48:48.45,00:48:50.07
Thank you

00:48:50.71,00:48:53.30
- From Chichina![br]- Chichina, and the money?

00:48:55.23,00:48:56.98
- Should i open it?[br]- Yes open it

00:48:57.95,00:48:59.89
I leave you alone love bird

00:49:09.80,00:49:11.35
How do i love you Celia de la Serna!

00:49:19.21,00:49:20.41
What's going on?

00:49:24.97,00:49:26.19
Fuser

00:50:19.57,00:50:22.58
- Che, are you ready?[br]- Me?[br]- Yes you

00:50:23.06,00:50:24.25
- Of course[br]- Let's go

00:50:24.37,00:50:25.47
Right away sir

00:50:55.64,00:50:59.86
Atacama Desert, Chile[br]March 11, 1952[br]Km 4960

00:51:06.02,00:51:08.51
You know what, my plan was a lot better

00:51:12.48,00:51:14.69
You are so fucking proud, at least answer me

00:51:17.46,00:51:18.88
Do you want to go back?

00:51:19.54,00:51:22.87
Go ahead...[br]I'll get to the mine and then Ill tell you what it looks like

00:51:24.21,00:51:26.73
Are you suggesting that i won't make it to the mine?

00:51:27.95,00:51:30.84
If you can little doctor asthma, i can do it too

00:51:32.53,00:51:33.25
Moron

00:51:34.44,00:51:35.90
Oh, you want to win?

00:51:42.09,00:51:43.95
Stop! Fuck!

00:51:54.02,00:51:56.40
- Good evening, how are you?[br]- What's your name?

00:51:56.53,00:51:59.04
- Ernesto[br]- Nice to meet you

00:52:09.99,00:52:15.43
Yes, that's it, that's were we are from

00:52:17.62,00:52:20.66
We didn't have much, just a dry and difficult land

00:52:21.57,00:52:23.42
It belonged to his grandparents

00:52:23.96,00:52:28.28
It was ours, until a landlord arrived and kicked us out

00:52:28.71,00:52:35.95
- And that is what they call progress[br]- We had to leave our son with the family and travel to find job

00:52:36.38,00:52:41.58
- Trying to escape from the police that wanted to catch us[br]- Why?

00:52:42.88,00:52:44.96
Because we are communists

00:52:45.87,00:52:49.20
We are going to the mine. If we are lucky Ill find a job.

00:52:50.59,00:52:53.69
Apparently they are so dangerous that they[br]don't care what party you belong to

00:52:56.73,00:52:58.75
Are you looking for a job?

00:52:59.30,00:53:01.12
No, we are not.

00:53:02.55,00:53:07.56
No? And then why are you traveling?

00:53:11.10,00:53:13.14
Just because

00:53:20.30,00:53:26.63
Bless you, blessed be your travels

00:53:31.27,00:53:32.60
Take this

00:53:33.07,00:53:33.53
Thanks

00:53:36.94,00:53:38.61
- Some "mate"[br]- Thanks

00:53:41.12,00:53:43.76
Those eyes had a dark and tragic expression

00:53:45.98,00:53:50.04
They told us about some friends that had disappeared[br]under mysterious circumstances

00:53:50.31,00:53:53.34
And that apparently ended up in some[br]part on the bottom of the ocean

00:53:57.43,00:54:00.18
That was one of the coldest nights of my life

00:54:01.69,00:54:09.75
But meeting them made me feel closer to human kind.[br]Strange, so strange to me

00:54:19.28,00:54:24.28
You...you too[br]You, the next one

00:54:34.91,00:54:37.39
Move it, guys, move it

00:54:39.06,00:54:42.41
Chuquicamata Mine, Chile[br]March 15th, 1952[br]Km 5122

00:55:02.78,00:55:04.20
Move it, guys, move it

00:55:07.00,00:55:09.24
Get in the truck. The rest go to your homes.[br]Out

00:55:32.63,00:55:34.67
You two, what are doing here?

00:55:35.77,00:55:36.62
Nothing, we are looking

00:55:37.00,00:55:39.71
Looking at what, this is not a tourist attraction. Out

00:55:40.42,00:55:44.01
Can't you see that these people are thirsty.[br]Give them some water damn it.

00:55:46.22,00:55:47.76
I will call security so they will arrest you

00:55:48.06,00:55:49.26
Oh yeah. Why?

00:55:49.49,00:55:53.30
Invasion of property. This is the property of the[br]Anaconda Mining Company

00:55:55.59,00:55:56.57
Let's go.

00:56:01.28,00:56:01.92
Son of a bitch

00:56:27.80,00:56:31.28
When we left the mine, we felt reality was changing

00:56:31.53,00:56:32.79
...or were we the ones changing

00:56:35.46,00:56:39.46
Going deeper and deeper into the mountain range[br]we found more natives

00:56:40.72,00:56:43.67
that don't even have a roof in what used to be their own land

00:56:50.19,00:56:52.12
Finally we entered Peru

00:56:52.51,00:56:55.31
Thanks to a truck driver half blind, Felix

00:56:56.79,00:57:01.77
I almost forgot...Today is Alberto's 30th birthday[br]but not in Venezuela, as he had envisioned

00:57:04.35,00:57:08.27
We were so tired, mom[br]that we couldn't even celebrate

00:57:12.97,00:57:14.20
Fuser

00:57:17.54,00:57:19.38
This is humanly impossible

00:57:45.36,00:57:47.08
Finally we arrived to the heart of America...

00:57:47.80,00:57:49.04
Cuzco

00:57:49.62,00:57:52.91
Cuzco, Peru[br]April 2, 1952[br]Km 6932

00:57:53.48,00:57:55.67
After entering the city, we met Don Nestor

00:57:57.32,00:58:00.60
A very wise man, mom[br]that ended up as our official guide

00:58:01.44,00:58:03.97
I was wondering Sir, which one of this walls is Inca?

00:58:04.23,00:58:06.72
This one should be the Inca wall, and that one is Spanish

00:58:07.18,00:58:13.49
We, as a joke, call this one the Inca wall[br]and that one the wall of the Incapables, those were[br]the Spanish

00:58:14.86,00:58:24.97
Cuzco was the capital of the Incas, but[br]when the Spanish came they destroyed everything,[br]and named Lima as the new capital

00:58:25.46,00:58:26.61
- Lima?[br]- Yes

00:58:31.21,00:58:32.18
- This is The Plaza?[br]- Yes

00:58:45.14,00:58:57.07
She says that she has never been to a school because[br]she has always been near the cattle, that's why she doesn't[br]know how to speak Castilian only Quechua

00:58:57.33,00:59:08.96
I think that before, there was enough money for everything,[br]but now there's little money and there are no jobs

00:59:11.19,00:59:13.09
That is affecting us more and more

00:59:13.33,00:59:24.78
Since i was little i have worked with crafts[br]and that's how i keep on level...regular

01:00:03.70,01:00:05.21
With both hands, with both hands

01:00:08.53,01:00:10.37
With both hands, Nestor

01:00:23.26,01:00:24.31
Good evening

01:00:29.06,01:00:29.96
Good evening

01:00:33.85,01:00:40.97
When i was working, the owner came[br]and he threw me out of the land

01:00:42.06,01:00:44.94
Once i was producing all the products[br]he threw me out

01:00:45.53,01:00:47.74
He threw you out? How? Did he call the police?

01:00:47.94,01:00:52.29
Yes, he brought the police.[br]He is a powerful man, he has a lot of money

01:00:52.66,01:00:57.16
- He wanted me to leave the land[br]- Yes, once it was producing

01:00:57.49,01:01:04.40
Yes, it was producing wheat, corn, potatoes, beans...[br]and i was meant to keep a part of it

01:01:05.06,01:01:14.37
But i won't stay behind, i have to keep moving forward.[br]Working, looking for money to educate my children

01:01:14.70,01:01:16.67
- How many kids do you have?[br]- I have five kids

01:01:17.11,01:01:26.47
- Have you joined with other farmers of the area?[br]- Yes, in the community we are organized, we help each other

01:01:26.74,01:01:30.46
We help each other, together

01:02:35.86,01:02:39.42
Let's see how you behave Fuser, eh?[br]That's it, that's it

01:02:40.84,01:02:42.52
For posterity

01:02:47.15,01:02:52.70
The Incas had a high knowledge of astronomy, medicine,[br]math, among others

01:02:53.19,01:02:55.64
But the Spanish invaders had powder

01:02:57.23,01:03:00.61
How would America be today if things had been different?

01:03:01.83,01:03:08.57
Fuser, look what i think. I should marry with an Inca descendant[br]and found an indigenous party

01:03:09.93,01:03:11.44
We encourage everyone to vote

01:03:12.74,01:03:17.45
Reactivate Tupac Amaru's revolution,[br]the indoamerican revolution, Fuser[br]What do you think?

01:03:19.26,01:03:23.96
A revolution without gunshots?[br]You are crazy Mial

01:03:37.97,01:03:41.73
How is it possible that i feel nostalgia for a world i never knew

01:03:43.86,01:03:46.96
How do you explain that a civilization capable of building this

01:03:48.31,01:03:49.65
is wiped out to build...

01:03:50.74,01:03:52.43
...this

Lima, Peru[br]May 12th, 1952[br]Km 8198

01:04:12.41,01:04:14.16
- I know this is not the one[br]- No?

01:04:22.15,01:04:24.71
Mercaderes 52, let's ask

01:04:25.12,01:04:25.63
Mercaderes Street?

01:04:25.78,01:04:31.61
Mercaderes?  2 blocks that way, then turn right and 6 or 7 blocks more

01:04:31.95,01:04:36.03
- This one has to be Mercaderes[br]- That one too

01:04:36.22,01:04:38.81
- Hey, is this one Mercaderes?      - Yes[br]- And that one too?       -Yes

01:04:41.43,01:04:46.20
Count from down there...from down there are 2, 4...[br]What?

01:04:46.85,01:04:48.39
Oh look

01:04:52.00,01:04:53.67
Can i help you with something?

01:04:57.07,01:05:00.84
This is the one from Mariategui...[br]and you should also read Cesar Vallejo

01:05:01.09,01:05:03.46
The best part of Lima, mom, was Dr. Hugo Pesce

01:05:03.83,01:05:06.16
The chief of the program for the treatment of leprosy in Peru

01:05:06.80,01:05:08.92
Alberto had contacted him before starting the journey

01:05:09.68,01:05:14.46
He fed us, gave us cloth, money and some very good ideas

01:05:16.45,01:05:22.09
Mariategui talks about the revolutionary potential of the[br]natives and farmers of Latin America

01:05:22.98,01:05:25.89
He says that the native main problem is the land

01:05:26.46,01:05:31.80
and that the revolution will not be a copy[br]but a heroic creation of our people

01:05:39.25,01:05:43.02
"7 ESSAYS OF INTERPRETATION OF THE PERUVIAN REALITY"

01:05:56.58,01:05:58.85
"We are too few to be divided", he says

01:06:00.09,01:06:01.41
Everything unites us

01:06:02.78,01:06:03.93
nothing keeps us apart...

01:06:04.20,01:06:05.87
Here's the main group of patients

01:06:08.31,01:06:13.30
Pesce let us stay at the guide Hospital, were they[br]treat patients in the first stage of the disease

01:06:14.94,01:06:19.03
The ones with more serious conditions are sent to San Pablo's[br]Lepers center in the Amazon

01:06:19.50,01:06:22.40
- Zoraida, this is Alberto, Ernesto[br]- How are you?[br]- Nice to meet you

01:06:22.83,01:06:26.64
Well, i think we know each other well enough[br]so i will allow myself to tell you something

01:06:26.98,01:06:34.30
I look into your eyes, Ernesto, Alberto, and i see[br]a great idealism, but also a lot of doubts

01:06:35.65,01:06:37.69
That's why Im glad that you are going to San Pablo

01:06:38.31,01:06:40.03
I think you will find something important there

01:06:41.12,01:06:42.59
Important for you

01:06:44.05,01:06:45.07
Thanks a lot

01:06:45.88,01:06:51.81
- Ok, if you excuse me, i will show you something, ok?[br]- Another surprise? How many surprises!

01:06:52.92,01:06:54.62
- What is he bringing, little on?[br]- A book

01:06:55.28,01:06:57.59
- A book, uh?[br]- Eat everything Tito, eh?

01:06:58.87,01:07:00.77
This is the great love of my life...

01:07:01.68,01:07:03.04
...after her of course

01:07:03.26,01:07:04.46
Ah, ok

01:07:04.95,01:07:06.64
It's my novel

01:07:06.85,01:07:08.49
"The Stillness of Silence"

01:07:09.84,01:07:11.45
I hope you give me the honor of reading it

01:07:12.37,01:07:14.62
- Of course, of course[br]- The honor is ours

01:07:15.68,01:07:17.75
You can tell me what you think after

01:07:17.88,01:07:19.24
- Yes, of course. Can i open it?[br]- Yes, yes

01:07:20.14,01:07:21.51
- Who dares read it first?

01:07:22.77,01:07:26.49
- Both of us[br]- Besides he reads faster than i do, really.

01:07:28.97,01:07:29.65
Ok guys...

01:07:30.36,01:07:33.20
- ...that's the boat, "La Cenepa"                              Pucallpa, Peru[br]May 25th, 1952[br]Km 8983

01:07:33.66,01:07:35.62
In five more days you'll be in San Pablo

01:07:38.06,01:07:47.14
Teacher, thanks a lot for everything, for your kindness,[br]for the tickets, the cloths, for everything. It's been an honor

01:07:47.34,01:07:49.32
Don't worry about anything

01:07:49.91,01:07:52.35
Thanks Doctor, thanks a lot

01:07:52.52,01:07:58.95
Don't you think you are forgetting something?[br]You've said nothing about my novel

01:08:00.15,01:08:03.45
- The novel, Fuser[br]- Did you read it?[br]- Of course[br]-So?

01:08:04.29,01:08:10.78
What can i say? I can sincerely tell you that[br]no one can tell a story like you

01:08:12.32,01:08:13.92
It has taken a lot of effort

01:08:14.76,01:08:16.97
- And what do you think Ernesto?[br]- He is fascinated!

01:08:17.32,01:08:19.71
If he is fascinated, i would rather to hear it from him

01:08:20.44,01:08:26.32
Look Doctor, I feel that your book is a little beaten

01:08:26.81,01:08:29.39
I think there are many common places...

01:08:32.07,01:08:35.76
- Well, that is not that bad[br]- No

01:08:36.36,01:08:39.97
Basically is poorly written and that makes it hard to read

01:08:42.80,01:08:46.56
It's a very good try doctor, but i think you should[br]focus on what you know best

01:08:49.84,01:08:52.82
I'm sorry, teacher. You asked for my opinion[br]and Im giving it to you

01:08:56.20,01:09:03.87
Wao son! No one had been so blunt with me.[br]You have been the only one. The only one

01:09:06.61,01:09:09.56
- Ok, i won't delay you any more, go on.[br]- Thanks

01:09:09.76,01:09:12.25
Good bye and...eternally grateful and forgive me.

01:09:13.33,01:09:14.39
Take care!

01:11:06.28,01:11:09.37
- Have you seen a bag that was over there?[br]- No

01:11:10.30,01:11:13.94
- It is brown and small[br]- If i see it Ill let you know

01:11:26.59,01:11:27.57
What is wrong with him?

01:11:28.83,01:11:30.27
Ask for help! Ask for help!

01:11:39.91,01:11:40.67
Pass me that pillow

01:11:48.12,01:11:49.86
Be calm, Fuser

01:11:56.83,01:11:58.62
Be calm, Im going to give you the adrenalin

01:12:14.31,01:12:16.17
Fuser... easy, easy...

01:12:27.13,01:12:28.03
Fuser...easy

01:12:45.67,01:12:46.55
Miss

01:12:48.71,01:12:52.37
I came to thank you personally for the[br]help you offer to my friend and i. Thanks

01:12:52.51,01:12:54.59
Don't worry, your friend got really sick

01:12:54.98,01:12:56.60
- Yes he did[br]- He gave me quite a scare

01:12:56.64,01:12:59.07
And i, thanks a lot, Miss.

01:13:01.12,01:13:04.02
- You know, a minute ago i saw a "bufeo" around[br]- Bufeo?

01:13:04.22,01:13:07.07
Well a river dolphin, but we call them "bufeo"

01:13:08.04,01:13:09.26
Have you ever seen one?

01:13:09.37,01:13:11.34
No, never. I heard it, but didn't see it

01:13:13.46,01:13:15.80
- I'm going to tell you a secret[br]- Me?

01:13:17.41,01:13:25.25
The bufeo's genitals look like a woman's[br]and the natives use it to relieve themselves

01:13:25.53,01:13:34.54
But there's a little problem, when they are done[br]they have to kill the animal, because the suffer[br]contractions so strong that don't let them get out

01:13:39.22,01:13:41.39
Miss, no offense but can i ask you something?

01:13:41.86,01:13:42.49
Yes

01:13:42.71,01:13:45.03
What brings you to these inhospitable waters?

01:13:45.43,01:13:50.06
I work on the boat, I come and go between Pucallpa and Leticia.[br]I'm from Pucallpa, you know?

01:13:50.22,01:13:51.75
- Pucallpenian?[br]- Pucallpian

01:13:52.22,01:13:55.85
- Do you know it?[br]- It is full of beautiful women, but you are the best

01:13:56.04,01:13:57.12
- Thanks[br]- You are welcome

01:13:58.58,01:14:00.02
And how do you pay for your ticket?

01:14:00.18,01:14:01.93
I give the captain part of what i make

01:14:02.89,01:14:06.65
But...how do you earn the money?[br]Miss...

01:14:09.60,01:14:14.29
Let's just say that, if we go to your room, Ill show you

01:14:14.78,01:14:19.78
My name is Luz, in case you want to[br]know who you make business with

01:14:21.44,01:14:25.92
Lucecita, for a night with you i would[br]give a pile of gold as big as the Aconcagua

01:14:25.98,01:14:29.11
But, darling i don't have a single coin

01:14:29.42,01:14:31.72
Well, then my friend, you'll have to excuse me

01:14:32.16,01:14:36.13
- But i have to go earn a living[br]- Are you going to leave me like this

01:14:47.57,01:14:48.97
I need the fifteen dollars, Fuser

01:14:49.22,01:14:54.90
Her name is Luz and she told me a story about a[br]fish that the natives fuck and she gave me a little kiss

01:14:56.11,01:14:57.35
I already spent them

01:14:58.32,01:15:05.21
C'mon Fuser, don't fuck with me.  We crossed the[br]desert together, we almost died of starvation and cold,[br]the accident

01:15:05.93,01:15:10.48
- My needs have higher priority than Chichina's pants[br]- I don't have them anymore

01:15:11.59,01:15:13.81
I gave them to the mining couple

01:15:21.44,01:15:22.64
- Court her

01:15:25.04,01:15:26.92
- Fuck you Fuser

01:15:31.73,01:15:33.19
The house wins gentlemen.

01:15:52.88,01:15:55.93

The Amazon divides the colony in two

01:19:00.81,01:19:10.96
The south part is where we keep the patients.[br]Here, in the north part is were the staff, the doctors and nurses live.[br]And a couple of nuns that are very efficient

01:19:11.54,01:19:12.99
This is your room

01:19:16.48,01:19:19.58
The beds are a little hard, but that is good for your spine

01:19:24.19,01:19:25.85
You can see the hospital from here

01:19:26.32,01:19:29.68
Over there[br]And that's the laboratory

01:19:30.37,01:19:33.80
Doctor, let me introduce you to our Argentinean volunteers

01:19:37.43,01:19:39.65
Alberto, i understand you have[br]some experience in baciloscopy

01:19:39.91,01:19:43.10
- That's right[br]- I believe he could help us in the lab, why don't[br]you take him with you

01:19:45.00,01:19:46.89
Ernesto, you are going to help me in the hospital

01:19:50.62,01:19:53.71
Here we have the more serious cases,[br]we transfer them from the south area

01:19:55.07,01:19:56.90
- Georgina[br]- Hello doctor

01:19:57.78,01:20:02.06
- And do you make the operations on this side too?[br]- Yes, on that side we have an operating room

01:20:05.80,01:20:09.54
She is Silvia, daughter of one of our patients[br]and a very good nurse

01:20:13.69,01:20:16.18
- How is he?[br]- He's better, doctor

01:20:17.40,01:20:20.42
- Then keep administering the same treatment[br]- Yes

01:20:23.47,01:20:26.96
- Doctor, then how many patients live in the south area?[br]- Almost six hundred

01:20:27.07,01:20:33.80
- All of them Peruvian?[br]- No, most of them yes, but there are some from[br]Colombia, Venezuela and other countries of South America

01:20:39.24,01:20:45.08
I suggest you use these gloves. It's true that[br]leprosy under treatment is not contagious

01:20:45.22,01:20:48.15
but the nuns are very strict about this

01:20:51.52,01:20:57.35
- If it's not contagious, then this is purely symbolic[br]- Yes, but Im telling you so you don't make mortal enemies over there

01:20:57.92,01:21:02.30
- Well, you'll have to forgive us but we are not going to use them[br]- Yes, thanks doctor

01:21:03.94,01:21:05.67
Don't say i didn't warn you

01:21:12.98,01:21:14.50
Take out the boxes.[br]Come this way

01:21:21.80,01:21:23.22
- Good evening[br]- Good evening

01:21:24.38,01:21:28.63
- Good evening.  Welcome to San Pablo[br]- Thanks[br]- You are very kind

01:21:28.98,01:21:31.69
- Papa Carlito, at your service[br]- Nemesio Reyna

01:21:31.95,01:21:34.38
- Ernesto Guevara[br]- I'm Alberto Granado, a pleasure to meet you

01:21:35.06,01:21:36.29
Nice to meet you

01:21:38.78,01:21:41.49
Doctor, didn't you explain the rules to them?

01:21:46.82,01:21:48.02
Nice to meet you

01:21:48.62,01:21:53.24
- Don Nemesio, nice to meet you

01:21:53.86,01:21:56.88
Papa Carlito is the head of the community.[br]They are Argentineans doctors

01:21:57.09,01:22:00.04
Nice meeting you, bye

01:22:01.52,01:22:03.22
They are real gentlemen

01:22:03.44,01:22:06.55
Dr.  Bresciani, this gentlemen arrive and think[br]they can behave as they want?

01:22:07.00,01:22:10.96
Mother San Alberto, this gentlemen have good[br]medical experience in Cordoba and Buenos Aires

01:22:11.95,01:22:14.69
That doesn't give them the right to behave[br]like this and break the rules

01:22:15.04,01:22:17.04
I suggest we leave this conversation for later, ok?

01:22:18.41,01:22:19.90
Thanks Mother, you are very understanding

01:22:20.85,01:22:22.22
She is the Mother Superior

01:22:33.99,01:22:35.57
This is the dinning hall.

01:22:35.90,01:22:40.52
The nuns make lunch on Sundays,[br]but only for those that come to mass

01:22:43.25,01:22:49.36
The sad thing is that most of San Pablo's patients are here[br]because they have been abandoned by their families[br]or thrown out of their jobs

01:22:49.51,01:22:54.55
That's why they try to adapt to their new life[br]building their own houses, seeding, caring for animals

01:22:55.24,01:22:57.01
- Doctor, good morning[br]- How is Silvia?

01:22:57.89,01:23:01.43
- She doesn't want to go to surgery[br]- Thanks doctor, Ill go see her

01:23:03.04,01:23:08.77
Silvia is a patient a little rebellious and if we don't[br]operate her ulna, she risks loosing her arm

01:23:11.74,01:23:12.91
Hello Silvia

01:23:16.67,01:23:18.24
She's very young

01:23:21.23,01:23:22.99
Can i come inside to talk to her

01:23:24.13,01:23:24.78
Yes

01:23:42.97,01:23:44.41
Can i sit?

01:23:52.28,01:23:54.10
Does your arm hurt?

01:24:05.55,01:24:07.11
What is wrong with you?

01:24:08.17,01:24:10.63
I was born with bad lungs

01:24:13.36,01:24:14.82
What a shame

01:24:15.56,01:24:21.03
No, is not that bad. Thanks to that[br]i skipped the military service

01:24:22.03,01:24:24.69
I didn't have to shine anyone boots

01:24:26.11,01:24:31.66
Is that why you became a doctor?[br]Because you are sick?

01:24:32.50,01:24:38.98
Is possible.[br]The first word i learned was injection

01:24:41.73,01:24:43.67
I want to be useful in some way

01:24:46.97,01:24:50.45
- You are wasting your time[br]- Why?

01:24:55.12,01:24:57.37
This life is hell

01:24:58.48,01:25:08.92
Yes, it's really fucked up, but we have to[br]fight for every breath and tell Death to fuck off

01:25:52.55,01:26:01.74
Hey Fuser,  Bresciani is going to write me a recommendation[br]for an internship in Cabo Blanco's Hospital, in Caracas[br]What do you think?

01:26:03.76,01:26:04.72
That's nice.

01:26:06.02,01:26:09.88
Nice?[br]What's going on Fuser?

01:26:14.15,01:26:16.85
- Did you see the river?[br]- Yes

01:26:20.05,01:26:22.76
It keeps away the sick from the healthy

01:26:26.52,01:26:27.90
Yes

01:26:59.38,01:27:02.13
That's it...[br]Just a quick...

01:27:24.16,01:27:25.12
Are you ok?

01:27:26.71,01:27:27.93
Scalpel

01:27:29.26,01:27:32.94
It's ok, it's ok. Look at me

01:27:35.51,01:27:40.84
That's it. The nerve is coming out

01:27:41.20,01:27:42.90
It's thick

01:27:46.21,01:27:52.81
I have four siblings, Celia, Ana Maria[br]Roberto and Juan Martin

01:27:54.79,01:28:01.12
And they are the ones i miss the most actually.[br]And also my mom

01:28:12.40,01:28:14.49
You have to tell us these things with time

01:28:20.52,01:28:24.38
- Have you been playing soccer lately?[br]- Not lately

01:28:24.73,01:28:30.22
For the next time, please wear some snickers[br]and invite me

01:28:30.55,01:28:31.67
Gladly

01:29:42.54,01:29:45.59
C'mon, C'mon

01:29:56.84,01:30:01.00
North team![br]Mark that one there!!

01:30:08.04,01:30:09.37
Out, out

01:30:09.54,01:30:13.77
Get out of there

01:30:14.69,01:30:17.15
Mark that...[br]Out, out

01:30:18.82,01:30:23.32
Gol! Gol!

01:30:26.88,01:30:29.87
What happened? What happened?[br]They scored you one fatty!!

01:30:32.49,01:30:33.46
Get out of here!

01:30:40.91,01:30:42.91
Excuse me

01:30:44.09,01:30:45.75
Sister, why you don't give us food?

01:30:47.45,01:30:51.98
The rules of Mother San Alberto are very clear,[br]we only serve to those who go to Holy Mass

01:30:52.43,01:30:55.56
- What is it?[br]- They won't give us food because we didn't go to mass

01:30:55.76,01:30:58.51
- Says who?[br]- San Alberto

01:30:59.42,01:31:01.31
- Mother[br]- Yes?

01:31:01.72,01:31:04.34
- We want to eat[br]- We deserve to eat like everyone else

01:31:04.80,01:31:06.78
- Yes but you didn't go to mass[br]- No

01:31:07.09,01:31:12.10
Then, how do you expect to feed the body[br]if you didn't feed the soul first

01:31:12.36,01:31:16.20
- Denying food is not very Christian-like[br]- Yes, i doubt Jesus would act like this

01:31:16.36,01:31:20.33
In this house we have a set of rules[br]that have to be followed

01:31:20.51,01:31:24.81
- I haven't read any rule book[br]- Neither did i. I think that if find it i would eat it

01:31:31.74,01:31:32.85
Your lunch

01:31:34.26,01:31:35.56
Did you steal it?

01:31:37.26,01:31:39.17
- Yes[br]- Thanks

01:31:44.11,01:31:46.51
- Did you took it from San Alberto?[br]- Yes

01:31:46.94,01:31:47.86
Thanks

01:32:03.74,01:32:05.29
- Is it deep?[br]- Yes

01:32:19.07,01:32:21.11
- Do you want some "mate"?[br]- No thanks

01:32:35.33,01:32:36.23
What?

01:32:39.29,01:32:40.34
From Caracas?

01:32:50.41,01:32:53.79
Great![br]Great, isn't it?

01:32:55.69,01:32:59.24
- Should i accept?[br]- What do you want to do?

01:33:04.16,01:33:06.13
Maybe is time to settle down

01:33:07.47,01:33:10.65
Yes, have a stable job, a girlfriend...

01:33:11.78,01:33:12.98
Get a belly

01:33:15.21,01:33:19.12
And you? Are you going back to finish school?

01:33:19.48,01:33:22.90
I don't know. If i find a way to get[br]back to Buenos Aires, yes

01:33:24.58,01:33:27.69
You're going to be 24 next week, Fuser

01:33:29.60,01:33:32.77
I should be thinking on something, right?

01:33:38.25,01:33:40.96
San Pablo, Peru[br]June 14th, 1952

01:33:54.47,01:33:58.24
The Mother dances well, uh?[br]I like the way she dances

01:34:18.17,01:34:19.51
No, I don't dance

01:34:31.33,01:34:32.14
Thank you

01:34:39.51,01:34:42.24
- It's good uh?[br]It's really good

01:34:42.34,01:34:45.35
Listen, this is the tango that[br]Chichina's uncle played in Miramar

01:34:45.61,01:34:47.47
- Ah yes, i like it[br]- You see[br]- Yes, yes

01:34:47.47,01:34:48.82
- Do you know how to dance it?[br]- This one's a little faster,

01:34:49.26,01:34:54.26
But you know how to dance it.[br]And there's a lady very interested in dancing with you

01:34:55.75,01:34:58.63
- Should i ask her?[br]- The bird in the stories flies and never returns

01:34:58.79,01:34:59.88
Fly, fly

01:35:00.53,01:35:02.17
Do you want to dance?

01:35:02.60,01:35:05.48
- Do you know how to dance?[br]- Yes

01:35:08.89,01:35:11.05
Is just that this version is faster

01:35:21.36,01:35:22.56
Dance Ernesto!

01:35:23.17,01:35:25.33
Did you think it was a tango?

01:35:25.66,01:35:27.81
Mambo, mambo, mambo

01:35:30.30,01:35:36.21
Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you!

01:35:36.27,01:35:43.52
Happy birthday, Ernesto, Happy birthday to you!

01:35:43.63,01:35:46.24
Make three wishes Fuser

01:35:54.81,01:35:56.38
Friends, one moment please...

01:35:56.80,01:36:03.90
I believe this is a great opportunity to let Ernesto[br]and Alberto know, how grateful we are

01:36:04.10,01:36:14.15
Not just for having gotten here, but also for their[br]commitment and enthusiasm to the patients of San Pablo[br]during the three weeks you have spent here

01:36:14.72,01:36:18.60
For that reason, we have prepared[br]a little surprise

01:36:19.27,01:36:23.07
Tomorrow you will receive a raft to[br]continue your journey

01:36:23.33,01:36:29.41
and we will name it,[br]suggested by this night, The "Mambo Tango"

01:36:34.29,01:36:35.40
Thanks a lot

01:36:36.88,01:36:43.00
Speech! Speech!

01:36:44.84,01:36:51.09
Well...I feel obligated to thank this toast with something[br]more than a conventional gesture

01:36:52.16,01:36:57.76
But given the poor conditions in which we travel...[br]the only affectionate resource that we have is the word

01:36:58.81,01:37:04.03
And is by using it, that i want to thank you all,[br]all the staff of the colony

01:37:04.14,01:37:05.33
Thanks

01:37:05.65,01:37:13.45
You, that give us this magnificent display of affection[br]by celebrating my birthday as you would celebrate one of yourselves

01:37:14.86,01:37:23.28
And since we will leave Peru tomorrow, this[br]words also serve as a goodbye

01:37:23.72,01:37:29.02
in which i want to put all my effort to give[br]a recognition to the people of this country

01:37:30.88,01:37:35.42
that uninterruptedly have overwhelmed us with[br]nice gestures since we arrived

01:37:36.37,01:37:40.00
And i would like to highlight something more,[br]a little off topic of this toast

01:37:40.42,01:37:43.03
But don't worry, i won't dance

01:37:48.28,01:37:55.59
Although our meager personalities prevent us[br]from being spokesmen of your cause

01:37:56.69,01:38:06.23
We believe, even more after this journey, that the[br]separation of America in false and uncertain nationalities

01:38:06.43,01:38:08.62
is completely fictitious

01:38:09.72,01:38:15.54
We are a single mixed race, from Mexico[br]to the Strait of Magellan

01:38:16.51,01:38:20.34
So, trying to free myself from any[br]nationality load

01:38:21.34,01:38:26.34
I raise a toast for Peru and for America united

01:38:33.27,01:38:37.84
Cheers

01:39:31.83,01:39:33.95
What's up with you?

01:39:35.84,01:39:37.43
Do you know where the boat is?

01:39:39.01,01:39:40.72
No, i don't see it

01:39:45.16,01:39:47.55
I'm going to celebrate my birthday on the other side

01:39:49.25,01:39:52.45
Yes, of course, tomorrow when we find the boat[br]you will celebrate your birthday on the other side

01:39:52.45,01:39:53.81
- No, now[br]- No you won't

01:39:53.84,01:39:56.31
- My birthday is today not tomorrow[br]- I know Fuser but...are you crazy

01:39:56.72,01:39:59.31
You can't cross the river at night with all[br]those animals that can eat you raw

01:39:59.36,01:40:02.84
Mial, how many times in this journey did we thought[br]it was the end and look, here we are

01:40:03.03,01:40:04.52
- This time is different Fuser[br]-Why?

01:40:04.70,01:40:07.54
Because this time i won't be around to help you.[br]There's no way Im getting in the river

01:40:07.71,01:40:09.45
You will always be with me Mial, come

01:40:09.65,01:40:13.67
Hey, come here you bastard mother fucker, come back here.[br]Think of me, your mom is going to kill me

01:40:14.23,01:40:16.69
Fuser, come back here.[br]Ernesto! Listen!

01:40:16.98,01:40:18.44
Son of a bitch

01:40:20.06,01:40:23.32
Ernesto come back![br]Son of a bitch

01:40:24.17,01:40:25.87
Come back here!

01:40:31.24,01:40:33.84
- What's going on?[br]- This crazy mother fucker wants to swim across the river

01:43:30.56,01:43:31.65

01:47:06.44,01:47:11.25
You know, i had memorized a speech filled with[br]anecdotes, and i can't remember a fucking thing

01:47:11.82,01:47:14.74

01:47:55.31,01:47:57.47
So much injustice, eh?

01:48:02.10,01:48:03.80

01:48:05.23,01:48:07.92

01:48:37.41,01:48:39.49
Fuser...

01:48:45.05,01:48:47.14
I have to tell you something important.

01:48:48.36,01:48:52.45
My birthday is not on April 2nd, it is on August 8th.[br]I told you only to motivate you

01:48:52.93,01:48:55.72
- I knew[br]- You knew? Son of a bitch

01:49:09.28,01:49:10.84
See you!

01:49:11.08,01:49:12.67
See you friend!

01:49:45.25,01:49:48.27
This is not the tale of impressive deeds

01:49:49.07,01:49:53.94
Is a piece of two lives taken in a moment[br]when they were cruising together along a given path

01:49:54.32,01:49:57.75
With identity of aspirations and a conjunction of dreams

01:49:58.75,01:50:04.11
Was our vision too narrow, too partial, too rushed?

01:50:04.59,01:50:06.98
Were our conclusions too rigid?

01:50:08.09,01:50:09.64
Maybe...

01:50:11.27,01:50:16.21
...but that aimless roaming through our enormous America[br]has changed me more than i thought

01:50:17.53,01:50:18.39
I..

01:50:18.94,01:50:20.01
...am not myself anymore

01:50:20.29,01:50:24.82
At least, Im not the same inside

01:51:57.13,01:51:59.93
Eight years passed before the two of[br]them would meet again

01:52:01.95,01:52:05.19
In 1960, Granado accepted an invitation to move[br]to Cuba to work as a researcher.

01:52:05.24,01:52:11.85
The invitation came from his old friend Fuser,[br]that at the time was known as Commander Che Guevara,[br]one of the few influential and charismatic[br]leaders of the Cuban Revolution.

01:52:14.90,01:52:21.90
Ernesto Che Guevara fought for his ideals in Congo[br]and Bolivia, where he was captured by the Regulation Army and,[br]with the consent of the CIA, was assassinated in October of 1967

01:52:23.93,01:52:33.14
Alberto Granado, always faithful to his friend Fuser,[br]remained in Cuba, where he founded the "School of[br]Medicine of Santiago".  Today he lives in Havana[br]with his wife Delia, his three sons and grandsons.
