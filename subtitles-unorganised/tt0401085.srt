1
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,801
As far as I can remember,

2
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:41,563
I've hated christmas.

3
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,680
What does it say, christian?

4
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:51,809
Gimme my car!

5
00:00:51,983 --> 00:00:54,109
Christmas 1960

6
00:00:55,653 --> 00:00:56,950
It should work.

7
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,147
Stop picking your nose.

8
00:00:59,324 --> 00:01:00,722
It's working!

9
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,022
There we go.

10
00:01:04,196 --> 00:01:06,220
Mine's not moving.

11
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,233
Gervais!

12
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,397
Han?

13
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,294
How are you feeling?

14
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:22,438
He's so cute!
Look, kids.

15
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:24,632
It's your little brother!

16
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,671
- Baby Jesus!
- Let me hold him.

17
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,370
Here you go.

18
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:31,311
He's beautiful.

19
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:34,083
Let me see!

20
00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:46,122
Christmas 1966

21
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:49,127
Not only would my birthday
always go unnoticed,

22
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,791
but it had to start
with midnight mass.

23
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:17,486
Midnight mass is too long!

24
00:03:17,662 --> 00:03:21,462
Go home and open your presents!

25
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:48,385
On the contrary, you're lucky
to share his birthday.

26
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:50,390
That doesn't happen
to just anyone.

27
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:52,393
It's special.

28
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:55,464
Hence the birthmark
on your scalp. Hmm?

29
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:58,625
It's a sign of being gifted,
you know.

30
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:08,636
At least, after mass,

31
00:04:08,814 --> 00:04:11,339
there was the christmas Eve party
at Grandma's.

32
00:04:17,155 --> 00:04:19,089
Hello, my beautiful Zac.

33
00:04:20,124 --> 00:04:23,025
The only advantage to having
one's birthday on christmas

34
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:25,789
was getting a bigger present
than everyone else.

35
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:38,567
He likes it, huh?

36
00:04:38,744 --> 00:04:43,646
But I especially hated christmas
because I never got what I wanted.

37
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:45,841
Dammit.

38
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,577
It's what he wanted.

39
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:50,813
So? It's not up to him.

40
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,480
You want to turn him into a fairy?

41
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:56,491
- Stop it. He's only five!
- He's almost six and looks seven.

42
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,822
- Oh, come on!
- Never mind "come on."

43
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:01,396
Now return it. Go on.

44
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:16,079
It would make you
a laughingstock, son.

45
00:05:17,215 --> 00:05:19,080
Daddy doesn't want that.

46
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:30,586
Daddy isn't trying to upset you.

47
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,423
He loves you far too much.

48
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:34,929
Hence the hockey game.

49
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:37,589
So he can play with you.

50
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:39,760
Go to sleep.

51
00:05:39,937 --> 00:05:41,699
Mommy will have a nice surprise

52
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:43,304
for you soon.

53
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:45,965
- For my birthday?
- No, after. You'll see.

54
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,611
Go to sleep.

55
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:55,676
What's a fairy?

56
00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:02,423
Nothing.

57
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:04,254
Hogwash.

58
00:06:04,429 --> 00:06:05,896
Go to sleep.

59
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,658
Idiot.

60
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:16,433
I knew very well
what a fairy was.

61
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:19,500
I especially knew...

62
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,745
I didn't want to be one.

63
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:35,091
Want to play, Zac?

64
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:36,727
No.

65
00:06:47,138 --> 00:06:48,662
Unlike my friends' fathers,

66
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,274
all of whom
were ordinary and uninteresting,

67
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:54,173
mine was the best in the world.

68
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:56,438
He has Patsy cline's,
Buddy Rich's

69
00:06:56,614 --> 00:06:57,979
and Aznavour's
entire collections.

70
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,617
He fired a machine gun
in the army.

71
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:56,567
Our secret side trips
to Norm The King Of Fries

72
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:58,538
made me deliriously happy.

73
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:01,644
For a few precious moments,
I was his favourite.

74
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:03,643
Take me

75
00:08:03,814 --> 00:08:05,645
To the ends of the earth

76
00:08:05,817 --> 00:08:07,182
Take me

77
00:08:07,352 --> 00:08:09,649
To Wonderland

78
00:08:09,821 --> 00:08:11,151
It seems to me

79
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:13,483
That misery

80
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:15,990
Would be borne more easily
under the sun

81
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:26,826
Hi!

82
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:28,335
Hello.

83
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:30,498
- You didn't bring any back?
- What?

84
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,869
Fries, you moron.

85
00:08:32,143 --> 00:08:33,804
You can smell it a mile away.

86
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:36,413
We didn't have any fries.

87
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:38,913
Did we?

88
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:44,111
My three brothers were morons.

89
00:08:44,288 --> 00:08:46,483
Starting with christian,

90
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:47,817
the egghead,

91
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:49,323
who read constantly -

92
00:08:49,493 --> 00:08:52,121
anything, anytime, anywhere;

93
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:56,397
Antoine, the sports nut,
a walking stinkbomb;

94
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:01,895
- What're you looking at?
- And Raymond,

95
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:03,438
my sworn enemy.

96
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,767
Get lost, you pisser.

97
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:09,106
Dad, Raymond called me
a pussy!

98
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:11,180
Not a pussy, a pisser.

99
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:14,417
Kitchen.

100
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,788
I could understand him

101
00:09:19,957 --> 00:09:21,651
being proud of christian,
or Antoine.

102
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:23,487
But Raymond?

103
00:09:31,469 --> 00:09:33,630
Aren't you going to introduce us?

104
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:35,931
My dad.

105
00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:40,442
- You're going out, Raymond?
- The little bastard's a casanova.

106
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:43,101
But he asked
for more ironed toast!

107
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:48,478
Hi, pretty baby.

108
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:51,213
After nine months of prayer...

109
00:09:52,657 --> 00:09:55,091
and superhuman feats...

110
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:58,394
the good Lord
would finally give me...

111
00:09:58,562 --> 00:09:59,586
Another boy?

112
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,062
What kind of lead you got
in your pencil, Beaulieu?

113
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:05,134
What can I say?
I have a surplus of male hormones.

114
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,793
- A surplus of hormones!
- That's irrelevant.

115
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:08,802
He has to change positions

116
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:10,304
once in a while.

117
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:12,568
Yeah, well, I've tried that.

118
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:15,837
What can I say? Five boys -
you take what you can get.

119
00:10:22,586 --> 00:10:24,076
Come on, Zac.

120
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:43,532
You like my surprise?

121
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,406
Christmas 1967

122
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:42,396
Take me

123
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,158
To the ends of the earth

124
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,734
Take me

125
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:47,393
To Wonderland

126
00:11:47,572 --> 00:11:51,268
It seems to me that misery

127
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:53,706
Would be borne more easily
under the sun

128
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:55,902
Drop by sometime.

129
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:07,220
See? Look. Again.

130
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:09,724
Zac has a gift.
I'm sure of it.

131
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,420
His colic stops
whenever Zac holds him.

132
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:16,230
I'll go see Mrs. What's-her-name,
the Tupperware lady.

133
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:17,890
She, too, has a gift.

134
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:21,060
She can staunch bleeding,
heal burns and everything.

135
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,230
She'll tell us if he's gifted.

136
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:25,898
No. You've seen
how he plays the drums.

137
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:28,067
A regular little Buddy Rich.

138
00:12:28,245 --> 00:12:32,409
Music runs in his blood,
I'm telling you. That's his gift.

139
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:35,018
He gets that from his old man.

140
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:25,091
Hi, pretty baby.

141
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:28,170
Mommy's little darling.

142
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:37,943
I can still remember the snow
slowly melting on his face.

143
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,118
I had just turned seven
and, unwittingly,

144
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:44,250
declared war to my father.

145
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,426
Are you crazy,

146
00:13:57,635 --> 00:14:00,263
dammit?!
What are you doing?!

147
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:02,529
Roll that window back up,
you nitwit!

148
00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:04,765
Do we have to tie you up?

149
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:06,569
Here, buckle up!

150
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:10,910
Christ.

151
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,380
Use your head, you nitwit.

152
00:14:17,555 --> 00:14:20,023
Stop slurping, you pig!
Don't be such a sissy!

153
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:25,622
Eleven bucks!

154
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:28,322
An imported collector's record.

155
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,232
You'll each reimburse me
if the guilty party

156
00:14:32,403 --> 00:14:34,132
doesn't come forward.
I'm warning you.

157
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,900
I'll teach you to take
responsibility for your actions,

158
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:38,541
dammit!
- Gervais!

159
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,231
I didn't do it.

160
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:13,169
It was an accident.

161
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:18,008
Scoot, you three.

162
00:15:25,523 --> 00:15:28,355
You'll not only pay for the record,
but your lies, too.

163
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:29,719
I'll teach you, you'll see.

164
00:15:29,894 --> 00:15:31,383
Go to your room!

165
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:38,462
He said it was an accident.

166
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:49,238
What in heaven's name
did you do to him?

167
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,115
Zac. He's changed.

168
00:15:55,286 --> 00:15:58,118
He's a crybaby, he dresses
like a girl. It's not normal.

169
00:15:58,288 --> 00:16:00,279
Get over it.
It's you who's not normal.

170
00:16:00,424 --> 00:16:02,892
He's a child, for God's sake.
Let him be.

171
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:05,029
"What did I do to him"!

172
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:11,865
- The others weren't like that.
- Each of them is different.

173
00:16:12,904 --> 00:16:15,895
Zac is more gentle, that's all.
More sensitive.

174
00:16:16,073 --> 00:16:18,041
He's not gentler, he's softer.

175
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:25,946
God, please don't let me be soft.

176
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:28,778
And return my dad
to his old self.

177
00:16:28,953 --> 00:16:30,250
Shut up.

178
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,833
Use your head, you nitwit!
Don't be such a sissy!

179
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:50,303
I did it on purpose.

180
00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:51,998
I'll tell Dad, you pisser.

181
00:17:24,074 --> 00:17:28,841
When will I stop wetting the bed?
I've been asking him a long time.

182
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:31,674
Never mind - no harm done.

183
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:33,908
Hmm?
You're not alone.

184
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:36,210
It'll stop eventually.

185
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:40,052
Keep praying. You'll see,
Baby Jesus will hear you.

186
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,249
Especially you.

187
00:17:42,427 --> 00:17:44,917
You were born on the same day.

188
00:17:45,096 --> 00:17:46,563
Sweet dreams.

189
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:04,512
Big chimneys, huh?

190
00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:07,644
Where are we going?

191
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:09,479
You'll see.

192
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:10,950
Careful.

193
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:26,135
Mrs. What's-her-name,
the Tupperware lady,

194
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:28,771
had realized my mother's dream:

195
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,140
She had walked
in christ's footsteps.

196
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:40,009
Try to trust your feelings.

197
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:42,912
You can feel things others can't.

198
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,154
You mustn't fear it.

199
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,622
He's been blessed
from on high, Mrs. Beaulieu.

200
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:54,457
The good Lord chose him

201
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:57,601
knowing he was strong enough
for what's expected of him.

202
00:18:58,635 --> 00:19:01,900
But give him a chance
to grow up a bit. Hmm?

203
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:03,664
So he better understands.

204
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,709
He's a good-looking boy.

205
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:08,436
He'll go far.

206
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:13,778
Christ... mas, I'm bushed!

207
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:17,143
I've got news for you.

208
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,789
Your son has a gift.

209
00:19:20,157 --> 00:19:22,990
A family's seventh child
of the same sex is gifted.

210
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,958
With my three miscarriages,
that makes Zac seventh.

211
00:19:27,497 --> 00:19:30,864
Who says your miscarriages
were boys?

212
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,669
They must've been.
That's all you can do.

213
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:37,000
We knew he could stop colic,
but he's otherwise gifted.

214
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:39,574
Gifted people
can pass their gift on to others,

215
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:42,473
if they're of the opposite sex
and not related.

216
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:45,911
Mrs. What's-her-name
passed all of hers on to him.

217
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,641
Oh, Jesus.

218
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,151
How much Tupperware
did that cost you?

219
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:53,221
None.
She didn't try selling me any.

220
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:55,551
I bought some.
It's different.

221
00:19:57,495 --> 00:19:58,791
This is no joke.

222
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,021
He's truly gifted!

223
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:03,463
Can your gift cure my headache?

224
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:16,906
There.

225
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:22,048
What's this?

226
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,880
Look.

227
00:20:26,624 --> 00:20:28,956
It's not my birthday,
as far as I know.

228
00:20:35,766 --> 00:20:38,098
Your record's unfindable.
We bought another.

229
00:20:38,268 --> 00:20:40,361
It's the same thing!

230
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:44,263
I know.
I already have this one.

231
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,342
The sound's not the same.

232
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,674
An imported collector's record
isn't the same.

233
00:20:50,848 --> 00:20:54,214
It's the thought that counts.
I'll just return it, then.

234
00:20:57,921 --> 00:20:59,855
Raymond, Antoine!
That's enough!

235
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:01,422
Christian! Supper's ready.

236
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:07,529
Come on, boys. Let's eat.
- Coming.

237
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:10,566
Gifted...

238
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,736
What do you think about that?

239
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:17,937
What did Mrs. What's-her-name
tell you?

240
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:19,939
I'm not allowed to say.

241
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:23,944
But she told Mom that if
the good Lord gave me a gift,

242
00:21:24,114 --> 00:21:25,775
I had to use it.

243
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,909
That I could help a lot of people,
even save them.

244
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,554
Tell him to think of him.

245
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:44,827
Think of Uncle Lucien.
He cut himself eating steak.

246
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:48,699
They're not going to start calling
for every little booboo?

247
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:52,331
Turn that music down.

248
00:21:54,979 --> 00:21:56,446
All I had to do

249
00:21:56,614 --> 00:21:59,548
was silently recite the secret
little prayers imparted to me

250
00:21:59,717 --> 00:22:03,244
by Mrs. What's-her-name,
which consisted not of asking,

251
00:22:03,421 --> 00:22:06,549
but of commanding God to heal.

252
00:22:08,091 --> 00:22:11,891
Remember, you can't use
your gift for personal gain.

253
00:22:13,096 --> 00:22:15,792
Or to harm others.

254
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,901
What a shame.

255
00:22:19,603 --> 00:22:20,865
What's he saying?

256
00:22:21,105 --> 00:22:24,471
He's not allowed to say.
Stop it, will you?

257
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,307
From now on, it'll cost a dime
every time you pick your nose.

258
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:34,347
You'll be rich.

259
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,986
You must know
how ketchup's made by now,

260
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,953
you've been reading the damn label
for half an hour.

261
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:48,521
Another pest
who just cut himself shaving.

262
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:50,290
Okay, I'll tell him.

263
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:57,564
Uncle Lucien's bleeding
has stopped.

264
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:11,246
Yes?

265
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,154
Well, I'll be damned.

266
00:23:14,425 --> 00:23:16,757
Great. He'll be thrilled.

267
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,725
Yes. Thank you.

268
00:23:26,604 --> 00:23:27,797
What is it?

269
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:29,700
Your lucky brother

270
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,866
is going to summer camp.
- What?!

271
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,443
I wasn't allowed to go at his age!

272
00:23:35,613 --> 00:23:37,444
You got yours.
Stop complaining.

273
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:39,912
We've never sent our children
to camp.

274
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:43,775
He'll sleep there?

275
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:47,617
Of course. He'll make friends,
have lots of fun...

276
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:49,986
It'll be a good experience
for him.

277
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:53,095
- He'll always remember it.
- I don't wanna go.

278
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:56,292
Oh, come on.

279
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:58,900
I don't wanna go.

280
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:07,377
I don't wanna go!!!

281
00:24:30,434 --> 00:24:33,061
God, please don't let it happen.

282
00:24:42,612 --> 00:24:43,909
Go to sleep.

283
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:55,918
God, please,

284
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,248
don't let it show.

285
00:25:58,422 --> 00:26:00,889
I'll never miss mass again.

286
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:54,353
Midnight mass
was so short and sweet

287
00:28:54,531 --> 00:28:56,624
now that I'd become an atheist.

288
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:59,065
I'd kept my promise, though.

289
00:28:59,203 --> 00:29:02,501
I'd never missed mass...
midnight mass.

290
00:29:02,672 --> 00:29:04,196
Once a year.

291
00:29:04,374 --> 00:29:06,399
It made her happy.

292
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:09,101
It kept his mouth shut.

293
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:38,099
You dragging your trash around,
brother-in-law?

294
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,133
It's your present.

295
00:30:40,304 --> 00:30:42,101
Well, if it isn't Zac!

296
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,173
What, no girlfriend yet?

297
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,517
Christmas 1975

298
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,447
Nice paper.

299
00:30:58,622 --> 00:31:00,452
Every year, I told them:

300
00:31:00,624 --> 00:31:03,148
No christmas wrapping paper
for my birthday presents, okay?

301
00:31:03,326 --> 00:31:05,020
That's not what matters.

302
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:12,565
After the drum set, accordion,
guitar and violin...

303
00:31:12,736 --> 00:31:13,725
a banjo.

304
00:31:13,904 --> 00:31:16,371
You said to surprise you.

305
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:20,908
It's so hard to know
what teenagers want nowadays.

306
00:31:21,078 --> 00:31:23,046
You try to please them...

307
00:31:54,745 --> 00:31:57,679
Some fantasies
are worth keeping.

308
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,984
Merry christmas!
Happy New Year!

309
00:32:02,152 --> 00:32:04,211
You know what time it is,
Raymond?

310
00:32:04,388 --> 00:32:06,150
You're late.

311
00:32:07,524 --> 00:32:08,854
I was starting to worry.

312
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:10,516
- Hi. I'm Doris.
- Good evening.

313
00:32:10,694 --> 00:32:12,524
- Merry christmas.
- Take off your boots.

314
00:32:12,696 --> 00:32:14,026
- How are you?
- Hi, Dad.

315
00:32:14,197 --> 00:32:16,028
- Merry christmas.
- Pleased to meet you.

316
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,724
I'm Raymond's mother.

317
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:25,739
My family always
appreciated gourmet food.

318
00:32:29,546 --> 00:32:31,308
Did you at least make a wish?

319
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:34,143
It won't come true,
he can't get it up yet.

320
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,720
My brothers
hadn't changed a bit.

321
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,823
Dad, Zac gave him the finger!

322
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:44,152
- Except my darling Yvan.
- Such brotherly love!

323
00:32:44,328 --> 00:32:47,091
And how polite
they are in public.

324
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:50,231
Turn that music down.

325
00:33:05,581 --> 00:33:06,911
Every christmas,

326
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:08,981
the bastard barely stayed an hour.

327
00:33:09,152 --> 00:33:11,450
Just long enough
to stuff himself...

328
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:13,249
and to piss me off.

329
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,597
Here, buy whatever you want.

330
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,639
Happy birthday.

331
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:33,935
Wait.

332
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,268
I loved daydreaming
about my mother.

333
00:34:00,437 --> 00:34:01,801
Picturing myself wealthy,

334
00:34:01,971 --> 00:34:04,235
so that, one day,
I could spoil her.

335
00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:08,343
Merry christmas!

336
00:34:11,915 --> 00:34:13,883
It's beautiful. Thank you.

337
00:34:23,326 --> 00:34:25,453
Oh, what a lovely dress.

338
00:35:20,883 --> 00:35:23,443
My cousin Brigitte
had just dropped out of school

339
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,112
to devote herself
to social dancing full-time.

340
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,757
At the age of 15.

341
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:53,314
I can dance too, you know!

342
00:35:55,085 --> 00:35:57,575
But it's not my specialty.

343
00:35:57,754 --> 00:35:59,948
Back by popular request...

344
00:36:00,122 --> 00:36:01,316
No getting around it.

345
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,106
It's your birthday!

346
00:36:19,242 --> 00:36:21,642
- You've really changed.
- Yeah, you too.

347
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:25,208
This is my boyfriend, Paul.

348
00:36:25,382 --> 00:36:27,009
My cousin, Zac.

349
00:36:29,386 --> 00:36:31,354
He has his driver's license!

350
00:36:33,723 --> 00:36:35,691
I'm stealing one.

351
00:36:49,072 --> 00:36:51,404
- You don't smoke?
- Never touch the stuff.

352
00:36:51,575 --> 00:36:55,067
Good thing. If it was up to him,
he'd be smoking nonstop.

353
00:36:55,245 --> 00:36:57,405
We go to the movies,
he wants to smoke;

354
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,411
we go skating,
he wants to smoke...

355
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,174
You skate? Roller-skate?

356
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:10,353
The guys' turn, full blast,
music blaring, really stoned -

357
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:13,518
you let yourself go...
you can hear everything,

358
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:17,030
and feel like everything around you
is moving in slow-motion,

359
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,667
like in a movie.

360
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,836
A stoner movie, yeah.

361
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,199
Try it.

362
00:37:28,378 --> 00:37:29,867
Give me a shotgun.

363
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:31,206
No way.

364
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:32,711
Are you nuts?

365
00:37:32,882 --> 00:37:35,009
I burned my tongue last time.

366
00:37:37,554 --> 00:37:40,887
I thought of you
and it stopped burning.

367
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,049
He has a gift
for healing burns.

368
00:37:43,226 --> 00:37:44,692
- What?
- And staunching blood.

369
00:37:46,229 --> 00:37:48,890
It's true! Tell him!

370
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:52,558
My mother got that
into the whole family's head.

371
00:37:52,736 --> 00:37:56,034
You stop your girlfriend's
monthly bleeding, too?

372
00:37:57,741 --> 00:37:59,071
Idiot.

373
00:37:59,241 --> 00:38:01,334
That's it, make a fool of me.

374
00:38:03,013 --> 00:38:05,139
I don't believe in that anymore.
Sorry.

375
00:38:07,517 --> 00:38:10,349
That doesn't mean
you've lost your blessing.

376
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,147
You blessed fool!

377
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:20,826
You want a shotgun?

378
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,715
Boy, have you changed!

379
00:39:05,575 --> 00:39:07,907
Well, well...
if it isn't the lovely Michelle.

380
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:09,705
- Hi, Mr. Beaulieu.
- Hi.

381
00:39:11,715 --> 00:39:13,511
I'll finish up later.

382
00:39:14,718 --> 00:39:16,014
No problem.

383
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:27,895
- Is she really on the pill?
- Enough about my cousin.

384
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:30,555
I'm not the one
who wants to sleep with her.

385
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:32,793
That's the last time
I confide in you.

386
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:35,698
Why are the prettiest girls
always the dumbest?

387
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,867
You've never seen her.

388
00:39:39,576 --> 00:39:41,873
I've seen her picture.
Enough said.

389
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,547
Don't be jealous.

390
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,216
You're dumb too.

391
00:39:53,757 --> 00:39:57,716
I see her once a year. How am
I supposed to sleep with her?

392
00:39:58,762 --> 00:40:00,559
Anyway, she's got a boyfriend.

393
00:40:01,765 --> 00:40:04,562
Older. As dumb as she is.

394
00:40:10,774 --> 00:40:12,571
Not as dumb as you?

395
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,242
Don't.

396
00:40:21,451 --> 00:40:23,749
It'll ruin our friendship.

397
00:40:25,454 --> 00:40:28,082
That's not what you said
last week.

398
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:30,758
Stop it.

399
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:37,265
See what happens?

400
00:40:38,802 --> 00:40:40,429
Absolutely nothing!

401
00:41:01,124 --> 00:41:02,887
Don't tell me he groped her.

402
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,010
You done imitating
that fucking fag?

403
00:43:09,185 --> 00:43:12,154
Huh?! You're making us
look like a bunch of idiots!

404
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:30,537
Get outta here!

405
00:43:35,111 --> 00:43:36,908
It's my room too!

406
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:50,588
C'mon, Toto,
ask him for an autograph.

407
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,263
Got a problem?

408
00:43:56,299 --> 00:43:57,425
No.

409
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,846
Having a crazy brother
also had its advantages.

410
00:44:12,015 --> 00:44:15,416
- Always ready to help...
- Pay up, you little bastard.

411
00:44:15,585 --> 00:44:17,553
...for the modest sum of $2.

412
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,512
We were here first.

413
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:55,214
Shut up, faggot.

414
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,286
What did you call him?

415
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,626
Apologize.

416
00:45:07,804 --> 00:45:11,102
Apologize
and switch back to his show.

417
00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:24,012
Apologize, I said!!!

418
00:45:28,391 --> 00:45:29,948
It's okay, Dad.

419
00:45:36,065 --> 00:45:37,088
Go on!!

420
00:45:42,405 --> 00:45:44,338
Sorry.

421
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:55,883
What's for dinner?

422
00:45:58,588 --> 00:45:59,918
What happened to you?

423
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:02,388
Just a hockey fight.

424
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,858
- Didn't you have practice today?
- Yeah, yeah.

425
00:46:05,995 --> 00:46:07,087
You fought with a teammate?

426
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:10,528
It was just a scuffle.
Didn't even drop my gloves.

427
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,225
- Who with?
- Tremblay.

428
00:46:14,604 --> 00:46:16,696
You got beaten up
by Tremblay's little fag?

429
00:46:16,873 --> 00:46:18,340
What, you four-eyed fag?

430
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,411
What's with you always
calling each other fags?

431
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,078
You'd swear we're nothing
but a bunch of fairies!

432
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,098
Please...

433
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:53,938
anything but that.

434
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:08,386
Sorry about last night.

435
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,923
You know I don't like you talking
to your brother that way.

436
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:15,393
Yeah...

437
00:47:21,437 --> 00:47:22,767
Okay, see you at work.

438
00:47:23,072 --> 00:47:24,538
Careful, now.

439
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,592
Please let me bump into them.

440
00:48:32,842 --> 00:48:34,502
What're you doing here?

441
00:48:36,412 --> 00:48:40,074
- Just in the neighbourhood.
- God, you've changed.

442
00:48:40,249 --> 00:48:41,738
What'd you do to your hair?

443
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,077
It's cool.

444
00:48:43,252 --> 00:48:44,549
Thanks.

445
00:48:45,588 --> 00:48:48,421
You alone?
- No, I'm with...

446
00:48:48,591 --> 00:48:50,717
my new dance partner.

447
00:48:54,263 --> 00:48:55,730
He's Italian.

448
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:00,333
Thank you.

449
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:02,693
This is my cousin, Zac.

450
00:49:13,883 --> 00:49:15,543
Okay, well...

451
00:49:15,718 --> 00:49:17,777
I'll be off.

452
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:00,486
Change... change...

453
00:50:00,663 --> 00:50:04,190
I would be cured of my asthma...

454
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:06,699
if I only managed to get through.

455
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,540
For the second time of my life...

456
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:30,090
I was declared clinically dead...

457
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:34,289
for three seconds.

458
00:51:13,536 --> 00:51:16,163
Thank God you were dedicated
to Virgin Mary.

459
00:51:20,376 --> 00:51:21,535
I can't believe it.

460
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:23,178
It's a miracle.

461
00:51:25,214 --> 00:51:27,340
You know you made your father cry?

462
00:51:30,386 --> 00:51:32,684
Don't ever scare us
like that again.

463
00:51:39,228 --> 00:51:40,855
Feel like talking?

464
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,368
I'll come back later.

465
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:52,303
While my mother performed
charitable works daily...

466
00:51:52,475 --> 00:51:57,344
her Baby Jesus
had only one thing on his mind.

467
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,836
You asshole!

468
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,837
What're you doing?!

469
00:53:42,885 --> 00:53:44,351
Fucking liar.

470
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,713
The hottest was a black chick.

471
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,882
It was like
she'd never eaten before.

472
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,893
Mind you, they smoked a couple
of joints. Makes you hungry.

473
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:30,032
She sucked him like a Hoover!

474
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:32,731
He held her head,
thrusting as deep as he could.

475
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:34,870
The harder she sucked,
the more he screamed.

476
00:54:35,137 --> 00:54:37,331
The more he screamed,
the harder she sucked.

477
00:54:50,786 --> 00:54:52,754
Ever had a blow job?

478
00:54:58,894 --> 00:55:00,794
What do you want?

479
00:55:24,086 --> 00:55:26,384
I was wondering
where my shades went.

480
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:29,557
Going somewhere?

481
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:35,222
Boy, is this gonna cost me!

482
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:38,233
I didn't ask for nothing.

483
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:43,564
Your neck still sore?

484
00:55:47,276 --> 00:55:49,437
We're out of HP Sauce.

485
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:52,273
You get a 2-for-1 special today.

486
00:55:52,448 --> 00:55:53,937
You'll learn to drive properly

487
00:55:54,116 --> 00:55:57,244
and how to make your father's
world-class spaghetti sauce.

488
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,715
Let's go,
before your mother catches us.

489
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:04,752
Go ahead. Turn the key,
put it on "D."

490
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:08,460
Good. Slowly, now.
Go ahead.

491
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:10,792
- HP Sauce?
- That's my secret.

492
00:56:10,966 --> 00:56:12,796
Watch where you're going
and shut up.

493
00:56:12,968 --> 00:56:15,596
Lesson number one:
Shut up and drive.

494
00:56:17,473 --> 00:56:18,940
Go ahead.

495
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:22,505
Slow down!
What are you, nuts?

496
00:56:36,158 --> 00:56:37,591
What are you doing?

497
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,227
The school principal just called.

498
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:42,990
Seems your son's been spreading
rumours about Raymond!

499
00:56:43,165 --> 00:56:45,395
I won't stand for smut around here!

500
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,559
Much less drugs!

501
00:56:47,736 --> 00:56:48,725
What?

502
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:52,937
If I have to call the police
to make Raymond understand,

503
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:54,973
I'll do it this time!

504
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:57,145
What's all this about?

505
00:57:00,149 --> 00:57:01,480
Huh?!

506
00:57:02,384 --> 00:57:03,715
What's this?

507
00:57:03,886 --> 00:57:05,682
His little brothers live here!

508
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:38,181
Stay away from me, I said!

509
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:43,718
I didn't rat him out.

510
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:17,457
He's already gone.
I didn't even say goodbye.

511
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:20,117
Could be the wrong time,
but can I have his room?

512
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:23,788
- I want it!
- No one's taking his room.

513
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:25,433
Especially not you.

514
00:58:59,668 --> 00:59:02,102
Does this mean
we're not just friends anymore?

515
00:59:04,773 --> 00:59:06,240
I dunno.

516
00:59:07,776 --> 00:59:09,403
What do you think?

517
00:59:24,526 --> 00:59:26,426
What's he doing here?

518
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:31,797
Toto the Weirdo.

519
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,491
Forget him.

520
00:59:39,074 --> 00:59:40,541
Peeping Tom.

521
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:43,678
What're you looking at?!

522
00:59:48,884 --> 00:59:50,511
Fucker.

523
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:17,635
She's so excited.
I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

524
01:00:17,813 --> 01:00:22,010
She went on and on about Brigitte.
We'll never hear the end of it.

525
01:00:22,184 --> 01:00:25,153
Seems she's putting together
a big show with her boyfriend

526
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:26,651
this christmas Eve.

527
01:00:26,822 --> 01:00:29,483
- With the Italian?
- No, she's back with the other.

528
01:00:29,658 --> 01:00:31,489
The mambo dancer?

529
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:33,490
He missed her big knockers.

530
01:00:33,662 --> 01:00:36,631
Who's the pig
who ate all my lard spread?

531
01:00:40,669 --> 01:00:43,467
Think of your little cousin Daniel;
he burned himself.

532
01:00:45,507 --> 01:00:46,973
Too bad!

533
01:00:53,682 --> 01:00:56,344
Rutting teenager
in his natural habitat.

534
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:57,985
Shut up!

535
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:01,412
What teenager?

536
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:21,100
You didn't come
just for my Tupperware?

537
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:31,075
How are you coping
with your gift?

538
01:01:46,735 --> 01:01:48,201
Beautiful story.

539
01:01:49,571 --> 01:01:53,404
A man dreamed he was walking
with christ on the beach

540
01:01:53,575 --> 01:01:56,043
while watching scenes of his life
flash across the sky.

541
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:59,574
Upon turning around,

542
01:01:59,748 --> 01:02:02,182
he noticed that
throughout most of his life,

543
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:05,012
there were two sets
of footprints in the sand,

544
01:02:05,187 --> 01:02:07,313
his and those of christ.

545
01:02:09,758 --> 01:02:12,022
Except during the worst times
of his life,

546
01:02:12,194 --> 01:02:15,185
when there was only one set
of prints.

547
01:02:17,099 --> 01:02:19,090
The man said to Jesus,

548
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:22,430
"You promised
you would walk with me always.

549
01:02:22,604 --> 01:02:25,902
Why did you forsake me
when I needed you most?"

550
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:29,740
Jesus replied...

551
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:35,276
"There was only one set
of footprints in the sand

552
01:02:35,452 --> 01:02:39,285
during the worst times
of your life,

553
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:41,423
because I carried you."

554
01:02:58,207 --> 01:02:59,731
I want to be like everyone else.

555
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,513
Thank God, you never will.

556
01:04:26,061 --> 01:04:27,891
What got into you?!

557
01:04:30,432 --> 01:04:32,558
You have to learn
to control yourself!

558
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:38,406
I'm not going to the christmas
party this year.

559
01:04:44,012 --> 01:04:45,980
The guy was twice his size.

560
01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:49,317
The little bastard's got nerve.

561
01:04:50,352 --> 01:04:52,478
He gets that from his old man.

562
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:56,514
He's been doing well lately, huh?

563
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:58,523
You call that doing well?

564
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:00,855
A little fight's no big deal.

565
01:05:05,634 --> 01:05:09,091
We should get him something special
this year, don't you think?

566
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:14,635
He just needed a girlfriend.

567
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:16,607
Michelle's a nice girl.

568
01:05:18,313 --> 01:05:20,941
He said she invited him over
for christmas Eve.

569
01:05:24,653 --> 01:05:26,314
He'll be 16.

570
01:05:26,488 --> 01:05:28,820
We can start
cutting him a little slack.

571
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:30,618
You didn't agree?

572
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:34,625
I said we'd discuss it.

573
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:39,494
She can join us, if she wants
to spend christmas with him.

574
01:05:39,668 --> 01:05:41,966
She can't take him away from us
on his birthday.

575
01:05:45,507 --> 01:05:47,668
He can do whatever he wants
when he's older.

576
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:49,969
In the meantime, we celebrate
christmas as a family.

577
01:05:58,520 --> 01:06:00,852
What about a new stereo
for his room?

578
01:06:04,626 --> 01:06:06,923
I can't believe
what a good ear he has.

579
01:06:08,463 --> 01:06:10,431
He gets that from me, too.

580
01:07:13,261 --> 01:07:16,230
- I didn't do anything.
- Don't take me for an idiot!

581
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,260
What you did was wrong!

582
01:07:20,435 --> 01:07:21,901
I didn't do anything.

583
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:24,929
- A liar, too!
- Let him explain.

584
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:28,770
See what that pram business
and your mollycoddling does?

585
01:07:28,945 --> 01:07:32,107
He's never to set foot here again!
Is that clear?!

586
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:35,443
If you can't choose the right
friends, we'll do it for you.

587
01:07:35,617 --> 01:07:37,277
Fucking little faggot.

588
01:07:37,452 --> 01:07:39,613
And you, you sap,
get dragged into it!

589
01:07:39,788 --> 01:07:41,949
- Let him speak!
- Stop defending him!

590
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:44,115
I know what I saw!

591
01:07:44,292 --> 01:07:47,055
What you did was wrong.
You don't do this.

592
01:07:48,797 --> 01:07:51,265
We went in to warm up, that's all.

593
01:07:55,637 --> 01:07:57,264
Did we ever beat you?

594
01:08:01,477 --> 01:08:04,707
Do we have to start,
so you stop mocking us!

595
01:08:07,749 --> 01:08:09,216
I'm sorry.

596
01:08:13,421 --> 01:08:15,251
I don't understand.

597
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,391
After everything
we've done for him.

598
01:08:18,927 --> 01:08:21,417
This shouldn't be happening to us.

599
01:08:21,596 --> 01:08:25,225
It can happen to anyone.
It's no one's fault.

600
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,904
Father carbonneau says
we mustn't seek to lay blame.

601
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:33,104
Father carbonneau?

602
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,243
I had to talk to someone.

603
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:39,247
- What am I, chopped liver?
- You're impossible to talk to.

604
01:08:43,518 --> 01:08:46,954
- The whole neighbourhood will know.
- Of course not.

605
01:08:47,122 --> 01:08:49,454
No one else is to know about this.
Is that clear?

606
01:08:49,624 --> 01:08:51,750
This is strictly a family matter.

607
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:02,767
What did the priest
have to say?

608
01:09:02,904 --> 01:09:06,897
It's a sin, yes, but not the end
of the world. He's not alone.

609
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:09,543
The sin is in the act,
not the inclination.

610
01:09:10,745 --> 01:09:12,406
Look who's talking.

611
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:15,209
Him and his cassock!

612
01:09:16,751 --> 01:09:17,740
Don't start.

613
01:09:17,919 --> 01:09:20,752
He says he knows a priest
who's real good with teenagers.

614
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:23,755
Forget it.
It's not a priest he needs.

615
01:09:23,925 --> 01:09:26,688
Sometimes I wonder
why we pray to a long-haired guy

616
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:29,422
who hangs out with a bunch of guys
in robes.

617
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:31,225
- It's fishy.
- Honestly!

618
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:35,236
Why are there
no female priests, then?

619
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:39,241
They're starting
to get on my nerves.

620
01:09:42,777 --> 01:09:45,802
Anyway, we'll take care
of his problem immediately.

621
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:47,915
It's all in his head.

622
01:09:50,385 --> 01:09:52,182
Abnormal people get treated.

623
01:09:55,223 --> 01:09:58,214
People aren't born that way,
they become so.

624
01:09:58,393 --> 01:10:01,226
It's up to us to make sure
that our son doesn't.

625
01:10:01,396 --> 01:10:03,260
Nature doesn't make mistakes.
There's no in-between.

626
01:10:03,431 --> 01:10:05,865
It's one or the other -
a boy or a girl.

627
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:09,700
I'm willing to pay for a shrink
if necessary.

628
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:14,238
Our boy is a boy.

629
01:10:14,409 --> 01:10:16,400
No way I sired a fairy.

630
01:10:16,578 --> 01:10:19,376
We'll wipe any such notions
right out of his head!

631
01:10:23,753 --> 01:10:25,413
You have to be sick

632
01:10:25,587 --> 01:10:28,715
to spend your life sticking
your pecker up someone's ass!

633
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:34,554
You've got a short memory.

634
01:10:40,435 --> 01:10:41,901
That was different.

635
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:44,929
And we only tried it once.

636
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:46,403
Once?

637
01:10:48,443 --> 01:10:50,411
Once or twice.
I don't remember.

638
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,746
Well, I do.

639
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:03,723
I'm not seeing a shrink.
I'm warning you.

640
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:06,156
I don't have a problem.
Understand?

641
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:13,702
He does take after his father.

642
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:48,268
He's freaking out over nothing.

643
01:11:48,436 --> 01:11:50,460
Nothing happened.

644
01:11:50,638 --> 01:11:52,435
We didn't touch each other.

645
01:11:53,608 --> 01:11:56,371
We jerked off in the same car,
no big deal.

646
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:00,442
Why do it together,

647
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:01,708
then?

648
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,193
Watching him excited you?

649
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:16,556
I didn't watch him.

650
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,294
Do I look like a fag?

651
01:12:20,435 --> 01:12:23,733
Do I talk with a lisp?
Strut like a peacock?

652
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:28,905
Nice idea of homosexuals
you've got there.

653
01:12:29,077 --> 01:12:31,238
They're not all like that.

654
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:35,776
They all become that way.

655
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:37,417
Sooner or later.

656
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:43,257
This is a waste of time.
I'm not a fag.

657
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:48,596
I'd rather die.

658
01:12:56,137 --> 01:12:58,002
It's just a figure of speech.

659
01:12:59,474 --> 01:13:00,872
Isn't it obvious?

660
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:04,878
Being happy and healthy,
or miserable and fucked-up?

661
01:13:05,113 --> 01:13:06,773
It's a no-brainer.

662
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:13,482
So?

663
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:16,991
A subconsciously deliberate
mistake.

664
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:20,153
What?

665
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:24,863
He says I deliberately did that
in your car so you'd catch me,

666
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,864
find out I was gay

667
01:13:27,036 --> 01:13:29,833
and accept it so that I could.

668
01:13:42,051 --> 01:13:44,678
Twenty-five bucks
for that hogwash?

669
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:48,879
You didn't buy it, I hope?

670
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:51,218
- 'Course not.
- Unbelievable.

671
01:13:51,392 --> 01:13:53,882
"A subconsciously deliberate
mistake"!

672
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:56,895
He'll deliberately reimburse me,
believe me!

673
01:13:57,565 --> 01:13:59,533
What do you want?!

674
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:09,640
You want to take this in to him?

675
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,011
He'll be glad to see you.

676
01:14:14,182 --> 01:14:16,479
I'm sure he's forgiven you.

677
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:31,758
Dad!

678
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:33,491
How are you?

679
01:14:33,668 --> 01:14:34,862
Come in, come in.

680
01:14:35,036 --> 01:14:36,866
What're you doing?
Get out of here.

681
01:14:37,038 --> 01:14:38,699
I don't have time.

682
01:14:38,873 --> 01:14:41,842
Your brother's waiting in the car.
I'll take a rain check.

683
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:49,376
Hey, bro.

684
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:50,984
How you doing?

685
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:54,014
So, you take my room,
you little bastard?

686
01:14:54,255 --> 01:14:56,223
Oh, Dad, I almost forgot.

687
01:14:56,991 --> 01:14:58,788
Can you lend me a few bucks?

688
01:14:58,928 --> 01:15:01,657
I couldn't cash my cheque.
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

689
01:15:13,975 --> 01:15:15,408
Better than nothing.

690
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:16,942
See you.

691
01:17:12,161 --> 01:17:14,322
I would be cured

692
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:17,464
if I could simply make it
through the storm.

693
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:31,597
Happy birthday.

694
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:34,240
Christmas 1980

695
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:37,378
Fall on your knees

696
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:43,407
O hear the angel voices

697
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:48,248
O night divine

698
01:18:48,424 --> 01:18:51,256
The night...

699
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:54,054
When Christ was born

700
01:19:15,883 --> 01:19:19,216
Yesterday when I was young

701
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:22,379
The taste of life was sweet
as rain upon my tongue

702
01:19:22,558 --> 01:19:26,084
I teased at life
as if it were a foolish game

703
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:30,628
The way the evening breeze
may tease a candle flame

704
01:19:30,798 --> 01:19:33,562
The thousand dreams I dreamed
the splendid things I planned

705
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:37,295
I always built alas
on weak and shifting sand

706
01:19:37,473 --> 01:19:41,068
I lived by night and shunned
the naked light of the day

707
01:19:41,243 --> 01:19:46,578
And only now I see how
the years ran away

708
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:53,311
So many drinking songs
were waiting to be sung

709
01:19:53,489 --> 01:19:55,979
So many wayward pleasures
lay in store for me

710
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:58,557
And so much pain
my dazzled eyes refused to see

711
01:19:58,726 --> 01:20:00,659
I ran so fast that time
and youth at last ran out

712
01:20:00,828 --> 01:20:02,455
He wrote that for you, Zac.

713
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:04,962
Yesterday the moon was blue

714
01:20:05,132 --> 01:20:09,329
And every crazy day brought
something new to do

715
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:12,234
I used my magic age
as if it were a wand

716
01:20:12,406 --> 01:20:15,898
And never saw the waste
and emptiness beyond

717
01:20:16,078 --> 01:20:20,343
The game of love I played
with arrogance and pride

718
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:24,348
And every flame I lit
too quickly quickly died

719
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:27,977
The friends I made all
seemed somehow to drift away

720
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:31,989
And only I am left on stage
to end the play

721
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:35,492
There are so many songs
in me that won't be sung

722
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:39,656
I feel the bitter taste of tears
upon my tongue

723
01:20:39,834 --> 01:20:44,430
The time has come for me
to pay for yesterday

724
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:50,976
When I was young

725
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,511
Happy birthday, my man!

726
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:02,382
The old man's still got it, huh?

727
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:12,093
It's been a while since
I've seen him with an inhaler.

728
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:15,635
He got rid of it.

729
01:21:17,004 --> 01:21:18,471
Since when?

730
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:22,135
- Almost a year, I think.
- He didn't tell us?

731
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:25,740
I said nothing, okay?

732
01:21:33,688 --> 01:21:35,656
I don't know about cake.

733
01:21:36,692 --> 01:21:38,181
I overate.

734
01:21:38,359 --> 01:21:40,020
We've got news.

735
01:21:40,195 --> 01:21:43,527
I don't want to steal your thunder,
bro, so I'll be quick.

736
01:21:43,698 --> 01:21:45,165
We're getting married.

737
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:51,766
You hear that?!
They're getting married!

738
01:21:53,641 --> 01:21:54,868
I'm very happy!

739
01:21:55,042 --> 01:21:57,033
This calls for another bottle!

740
01:21:58,613 --> 01:21:59,637
Congratulations.

741
01:22:02,149 --> 01:22:04,117
How about a double wedding, honey?

742
01:22:04,285 --> 01:22:06,253
Sit down and shut up.

743
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:08,284
You look like a damn fool.

744
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:22,033
What's the matter?

745
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:25,972
What's going on?

746
01:22:30,711 --> 01:22:32,269
Tell him to go to hell.

747
01:22:32,446 --> 01:22:34,470
Shut up, fag.

748
01:22:34,716 --> 01:22:36,376
You shut up.

749
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:41,419
You seem to be sniffing a lot
for someone in detox.

750
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:43,147
Did I miss something?

751
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:45,655
Two subjects had become taboo
at home:

752
01:22:45,826 --> 01:22:46,656
Me,

753
01:22:46,827 --> 01:22:48,953
and Raymond.
- Sucking cock's made you a prick?

754
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,529
That's enough!

755
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:53,258
Your ass must've been raw
after prison.

756
01:22:53,434 --> 01:22:59,464
He'd done a year for beating up
a junkie who tried to steal his coke.

757
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:01,875
You'd have enjoyed that, huh?

758
01:23:02,044 --> 01:23:03,738
That's quite enough!

759
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:05,601
It's christmas!

760
01:23:05,746 --> 01:23:07,407
Can't we eat in peace?!

761
01:23:16,223 --> 01:23:17,985
Idiots!

762
01:24:27,795 --> 01:24:29,125
How sweet life was

763
01:24:29,296 --> 01:24:32,060
since I had become
so happy and fulfilled.

764
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:23,913
Aw, Mom!

765
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:28,087
Yeah, that's right.

766
01:25:29,623 --> 01:25:32,786
Don't call me back
to say she's stopped bleeding.

767
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,791
She'll stop anyway,

768
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:36,760
whether or not I think of her.

769
01:25:50,811 --> 01:25:52,802
If I truly had a gift,

770
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:55,470
by dint of being his instrument,

771
01:25:55,649 --> 01:25:58,139
perhaps he would one day
answer my prayers.

772
01:26:11,632 --> 01:26:13,759
Had I known,
I wouldn't have come today.

773
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:17,260
I think...

774
01:26:17,438 --> 01:26:19,235
you won't come much anymore.

775
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:23,674
He says it's just
for a couple of weeks.

776
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:25,835
Just long enough
to get back on his feet.

777
01:26:26,013 --> 01:26:28,004
To run through our savings,
you mean.

778
01:26:28,182 --> 01:26:30,843
Anyway, he seems determined.
I've never seen him like that.

779
01:26:31,018 --> 01:26:34,476
I think, this time, he really wants
to clean up his act.

780
01:26:36,023 --> 01:26:38,992
Please, make an effort.
Your brother needs help.

781
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,822
So Michelle's well, then?

782
01:26:42,863 --> 01:26:44,193
Yeah.

783
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:45,832
I brought your records back.

784
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:51,500
- Coffee?
- It's okay, Mom, I'll do it.

785
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,470
What's new?

786
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:57,735
Not much.
Classes, work.

787
01:26:57,878 --> 01:27:00,312
So, were they a hit?

788
01:27:00,482 --> 01:27:02,779
Your brother's playing
my old records at his club.

789
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:04,577
Can you believe it?

790
01:27:07,656 --> 01:27:09,782
If that's the nutcase,
I'm not here.

791
01:27:12,994 --> 01:27:15,484
No, he's busy.
Can he call you back?

792
01:27:15,664 --> 01:27:16,756
That her?

793
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:23,302
It was for Yvan.

794
01:27:27,842 --> 01:27:29,639
Is Doris the "nutcase"?

795
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,974
She was nuts to put up with you
for six years, that's for sure!

796
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:50,022
I'm sorry, Mom.

797
01:27:51,732 --> 01:27:53,700
I'll be out of your hair soon.

798
01:27:55,737 --> 01:27:57,567
I missed...

799
01:27:57,772 --> 01:28:00,296
your delicious ironed toast.

800
01:28:04,011 --> 01:28:05,773
I love you, Mom.

801
01:28:13,187 --> 01:28:14,654
Any bacon left?

802
01:28:16,024 --> 01:28:17,684
Well, I'll be going.

803
01:28:17,858 --> 01:28:19,154
Already?

804
01:28:20,361 --> 01:28:22,225
- Need a ride back?
- Never mind, Dad.

805
01:28:22,396 --> 01:28:23,555
I'll go.

806
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:25,895
Coming?

807
01:28:30,437 --> 01:28:32,098
It's disco?

808
01:28:32,273 --> 01:28:33,603
Not just disco.

809
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:35,435
I play a bit of everything.

810
01:28:35,609 --> 01:28:37,076
Anything unusual.

811
01:28:38,278 --> 01:28:41,770
I'll come see you at some point.
I'll make an exception.

812
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:44,918
I don't drink anymore,
so I avoid bars.

813
01:28:47,288 --> 01:28:50,620
I don't drink, smoke
or swear anymore.

814
01:28:50,791 --> 01:28:53,760
Fuck, I left my bag of weed
at the pub.

815
01:28:56,797 --> 01:28:58,765
You can drop me at the corner.

816
01:29:04,072 --> 01:29:05,164
Listen...

817
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:12,708
I know I haven't always been
cool with you.

818
01:29:16,917 --> 01:29:18,384
I need money.

819
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:24,080
I'll pay you back. I don't know
when, but I swear I will.

820
01:29:24,258 --> 01:29:25,747
You're asking me?

821
01:29:25,926 --> 01:29:29,418
The old man brags that his little
pet makes more than he does.

822
01:29:29,596 --> 01:29:31,257
If he's got a pet,
it sure isn't me.

823
01:29:31,433 --> 01:29:33,594
Don't be a prick, I'm in a jam.

824
01:29:33,768 --> 01:29:37,396
Even if I was a millionaire,
I wouldn't lend you a dime.

825
01:29:45,447 --> 01:29:49,577
Antoine and christian did.
Even Fatty spotted me 20.

826
01:29:51,453 --> 01:29:52,749
Come on!

827
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:56,350
Do I have to give you a blow job?

828
01:30:07,802 --> 01:30:09,599
That's it, go kill yourself.

829
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,466
Aren't you in bed yet?

830
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:44,693
Here.

831
01:30:44,838 --> 01:30:47,136
Someone left this for you tonight.

832
01:30:51,346 --> 01:30:52,642
G'night.

833
01:31:09,963 --> 01:31:13,126
You want to get things hopping,
give this tape to the DJ.

834
01:31:13,267 --> 01:31:16,565
- Do I have to wear this?
- I want this off, too.

835
01:31:16,737 --> 01:31:20,070
Bunch of nitwits. A tux
without a bow tie isn't a tux.

836
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:22,730
We're all dressed the same.
That's the beauty of it. Huh?

837
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:24,377
Very nice.

838
01:31:25,547 --> 01:31:27,036
Where have you been?

839
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:30,215
Fatty.

840
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:35,218
- Goddammit, Raymond!
- I'll pay you back.

841
01:31:39,928 --> 01:31:41,190
Congratulations.

842
01:31:48,402 --> 01:31:49,891
Aren't you going to introduce us?

843
01:31:51,271 --> 01:31:52,760
My mother.

844
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:54,270
My brothers.

845
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:56,204
My father. Min.

846
01:31:56,343 --> 01:31:57,776
What's that?

847
01:31:57,945 --> 01:31:59,242
Min.

848
01:32:34,916 --> 01:32:36,713
He takes after his old man!

849
01:33:12,486 --> 01:33:14,885
Is that idiot gonna play my tape
or what?

850
01:33:30,971 --> 01:33:31,960
Not dancing?

851
01:33:32,139 --> 01:33:34,300
I'm waiting for my song.

852
01:33:34,474 --> 01:33:36,442
By popular request...

853
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:44,516
Shall we go smoke one outside?

854
01:33:44,685 --> 01:33:46,118
Good idea.

855
01:33:47,655 --> 01:33:51,112
You two go ahead.
Michelle and I will have girl talk.

856
01:34:23,691 --> 01:34:25,659
What is it?

857
01:34:33,166 --> 01:34:34,633
Your girlfriend's nice.

858
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:39,972
She's cute, too.

859
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:46,574
You want a shotgun?

860
01:35:57,051 --> 01:35:58,210
A coke.

861
01:35:59,986 --> 01:36:01,180
Same.

862
01:36:05,993 --> 01:36:07,620
I'm very proud of you.

863
01:36:14,669 --> 01:36:15,498
What's so funny?

864
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:24,208
Check those two out.

865
01:36:24,377 --> 01:36:27,642
Little Zac sure seems
to like his cousin.

866
01:36:27,815 --> 01:36:30,044
Talk about keeping it
in the family!

867
01:36:30,218 --> 01:36:32,379
He's not after his cousin,
but her boyfriend.

868
01:36:32,553 --> 01:36:36,352
I saw them French-kissing
in the parking lot earlier.

869
01:36:37,725 --> 01:36:39,089
So it's true.

870
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:41,352
Junior's a fag.

871
01:36:41,528 --> 01:36:43,018
Looks like it.

872
01:36:51,572 --> 01:36:52,970
Ah, damn.

873
01:37:32,279 --> 01:37:33,746
Don't touch me!

874
01:37:36,917 --> 01:37:38,748
Are you okay?

875
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:48,552
Keep dancing.

876
01:37:48,728 --> 01:37:51,127
Just a little misunderstanding.

877
01:37:51,299 --> 01:37:52,788
The wedding goes on.
Keep dancing.

878
01:37:52,967 --> 01:37:54,297
No, everything's okay.

879
01:37:54,467 --> 01:37:55,934
Keep dancing!

880
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:02,866
Christian!

881
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:07,573
I'm sorry!

882
01:38:11,952 --> 01:38:13,283
What's going on?!

883
01:38:13,454 --> 01:38:14,750
Stop!

884
01:38:16,623 --> 01:38:18,420
Give us a minute?

885
01:38:23,965 --> 01:38:25,659
On your brother's wedding day!

886
01:38:27,301 --> 01:38:29,393
Raymond causes trouble
and I get in shit?

887
01:38:29,569 --> 01:38:31,764
What happened was your fault.
Your brother was defending you.

888
01:38:31,939 --> 01:38:34,429
You were being called a fag!

889
01:38:35,642 --> 01:38:38,611
They saw you in the parking lot
with your cousin's boyfriend!

890
01:38:40,313 --> 01:38:41,746
What did they see?

891
01:38:44,652 --> 01:38:46,778
It's not what you think.

892
01:38:50,157 --> 01:38:51,646
We were smoking a joint.

893
01:38:51,825 --> 01:38:53,850
We just gave each other a shotgun.

894
01:38:56,663 --> 01:38:59,153
You're a born liar.

895
01:38:59,734 --> 01:39:01,462
Nothing happened!

896
01:39:01,602 --> 01:39:03,593
Be a man for once in your life

897
01:39:03,771 --> 01:39:05,830
and tell the truth!

898
01:39:07,107 --> 01:39:08,904
What do you want to hear?!

899
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:11,433
That I'm gay?!

900
01:39:11,612 --> 01:39:12,771
A fag?!

901
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:14,471
That I suck cock?!

902
01:39:17,117 --> 01:39:19,278
Yes, something happened,
but not with him!

903
01:39:19,986 --> 01:39:21,351
You know with who.

904
01:39:24,825 --> 01:39:26,155
Nothing happened earlier.

905
01:39:26,326 --> 01:39:29,159
But I would've fucking loved it
if something had!

906
01:39:30,797 --> 01:39:32,890
Fucking right!

907
01:39:39,306 --> 01:39:40,602
Go.

908
01:39:43,843 --> 01:39:45,743
Go.

909
01:39:47,313 --> 01:39:48,610
Go away!

910
01:41:25,178 --> 01:41:26,975
Forgive me, Mom.

911
01:41:27,147 --> 01:41:29,138
I know you'll be sad I'm gone.

912
01:41:29,316 --> 01:41:32,183
But I know you'll be glad
to know where I am.

913
01:41:32,352 --> 01:41:34,149
Don't worry.

914
01:41:34,321 --> 01:41:36,482
Your God is watching over me.

915
01:41:36,657 --> 01:41:39,489
Raymond made me realize something
the other day:

916
01:41:39,659 --> 01:41:41,752
I've never told you I love you.

917
01:41:53,940 --> 01:41:56,340
This side trip to the Holy Land,
before Europe,

918
01:41:56,510 --> 01:41:58,137
would make her ecstatic.

919
01:42:01,982 --> 01:42:04,745
Walking in christ's footsteps
certainly intrigued me...

920
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:09,611
but I hadn't crossed the Atlantic

921
01:42:09,789 --> 01:42:11,757
out of catholic faith.

922
01:45:11,438 --> 01:45:13,235
Zac, are you there?

923
01:45:17,611 --> 01:45:19,077
I love you, sweetheart!

924
01:49:53,487 --> 01:49:56,785
God works in mysterious ways,
my mother always said.

925
01:50:45,939 --> 01:50:48,873
The good Lord brought you back.
It's a sign.

926
01:50:52,411 --> 01:50:54,208
You'll heal him.

927
01:51:18,771 --> 01:51:20,705
Thanks for coming, christian.

928
01:51:32,419 --> 01:51:34,387
I'm so happy you're staying.

929
01:51:37,591 --> 01:51:39,388
I want to know everything.

930
01:51:42,429 --> 01:51:43,793
Dad coming down?

931
01:51:45,765 --> 01:51:47,232
He's in bed already.

932
01:51:48,434 --> 01:51:50,231
- Good night.
- Good night.

933
01:52:01,213 --> 01:52:03,204
I found him lying there,

934
01:52:03,382 --> 01:52:05,350
with a syringe in his arm.

935
01:52:17,596 --> 01:52:20,929
I think it'll be a while
before I get that 20 back.

936
01:52:23,770 --> 01:52:24,736
What?

937
01:52:26,273 --> 01:52:28,570
You lost that 20 long ago.

938
01:52:32,112 --> 01:52:34,409
If you ask me,
it was no accident.

939
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:56,427
He'll pull through.
He's tough.

940
01:54:02,903 --> 01:54:04,871
I know I'm not a perfect father.

941
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:10,038
You certainly wouldn't have
the problems you do otherwise.

942
01:54:10,910 --> 01:54:12,537
Raymond, either.

943
01:54:14,247 --> 01:54:17,079
I'm trying to understand
what's happening to us now...

944
01:54:17,249 --> 01:54:18,716
It's not easy.

945
01:54:24,090 --> 01:54:26,557
I know I'm partly to blame.

946
01:54:30,430 --> 01:54:31,760
I'd like to redeem myself,

947
01:54:31,932 --> 01:54:33,729
but I don't know how.

948
01:54:36,436 --> 01:54:38,768
I don't know what to tell you...

949
01:54:38,939 --> 01:54:42,032
to make you understand
you're not what you think.

950
01:54:50,416 --> 01:54:53,714
You can't forsake
life's greatest pleasure -

951
01:54:55,088 --> 01:54:56,555
having children.

952
01:54:59,092 --> 01:55:01,253
There's nothing more beautiful...

953
01:55:01,393 --> 01:55:02,690
more powerful.

954
01:55:03,697 --> 01:55:07,029
And that really hits home
when you come close...

955
01:55:07,199 --> 01:55:08,666
to losing one.

956
01:55:11,036 --> 01:55:12,162
Because...

957
01:55:14,874 --> 01:55:16,670
there's no greater pain.

958
01:55:25,819 --> 01:55:29,276
The good Lord must surely
be trying to tell me something.

959
01:55:37,229 --> 01:55:39,857
If you think it's a lost cause...

960
01:55:41,401 --> 01:55:43,425
that you can't change...

961
01:55:49,876 --> 01:55:52,173
I can't accept that.

962
01:55:54,213 --> 01:55:55,612
I can't.

963
01:57:33,012 --> 01:57:34,639
I'm sorry.

964
01:58:22,061 --> 01:58:23,358
Speaking.

965
01:58:27,399 --> 01:58:29,060
Oh, my God.

966
01:58:29,235 --> 01:58:30,531
Oh, no.

967
01:58:44,083 --> 01:58:46,482
Even in the face of death,
we have faith that life goes on,

968
01:58:46,586 --> 01:58:47,916
for it comes from God.

969
01:58:48,087 --> 01:58:51,215
It is to him
that we now turn in prayer.

970
01:58:54,527 --> 01:58:56,187
Our Father

971
01:58:56,362 --> 01:58:57,692
Who art in heaven

972
01:58:57,863 --> 01:58:59,194
Hallowed be thy name

973
01:58:59,365 --> 01:59:00,991
Thy kingdom come

974
01:59:01,166 --> 01:59:03,930
They will be done
On earth as it is in heaven

975
01:59:04,103 --> 01:59:05,569
Give us this day

976
01:59:05,737 --> 01:59:07,102
Our daily bread

977
01:59:07,273 --> 01:59:08,603
And forgive us our trespasses

978
01:59:08,774 --> 01:59:10,799
As we forgive those
who trespass against us

979
01:59:10,977 --> 01:59:14,275
And lead us not into temptation

980
01:59:14,447 --> 01:59:16,141
But deliver us from evil

981
01:59:46,546 --> 01:59:48,070
You spoke well.

982
01:59:49,115 --> 01:59:51,412
I was deeply... touched.

983
02:00:26,486 --> 02:00:27,782
Ciao, bro.

984
02:00:33,559 --> 02:00:34,786
See ya, kid.

985
02:00:37,329 --> 02:00:38,318
Mr. Beaulieu...

986
02:00:38,497 --> 02:00:40,465
You'll come visit us, hmm?

987
02:01:07,427 --> 02:01:08,757
Bye, Dad.

988
02:01:08,928 --> 02:01:11,054
Take care of yourself.
Mom, too.

989
02:03:04,510 --> 02:03:08,172
I don't know if it was Raymond's
passing, or if time heals all wounds,

990
02:03:08,347 --> 02:03:12,009
but my father had become
my father once more.

991
02:03:12,185 --> 02:03:14,379
Although it took him 10 years

992
02:03:14,554 --> 02:03:16,351
to allow me into his home
with a lover.

993
02:03:16,522 --> 02:03:20,322
And we've never mentioned
our differences since.

994
02:03:20,893 --> 02:03:22,986
Nor Patsy cline.

995
02:04:44,210 --> 02:04:46,735
