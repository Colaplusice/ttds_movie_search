1
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,369
How long until
we get to his estate?

2
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,284
We've been flying over his
estate for the past two hours.

3
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,521
You're leaving me here?

4
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,729
This is as close as I'm allowed
to get to the building.

5
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,485
What building?

6
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,524
Follow the river.

7
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,447
Got it.

8
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,648
Keep your head down and
get clear of the rotors.

9
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,801
Okay.

10
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,080
<i>Caleb Smith.</i>

11
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,961
Yes.

12
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,800
<i>Please approach the console
and face the screen.</i>

13
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,240
Oh!

14
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,080
<i>Take your keycard.</i>

15
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,804
<i>You may now
enter the residence.</i>

16
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,481
Hello?

17
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,841
Hello?

18
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,171
Caleb Smith.

19
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,841
Hey.

20
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,921
Dude!

21
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,206
I've been so looking forward
to this week with you.

22
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,521
Come in. Come on in.

23
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,601
Thanks.

24
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,329
You want something to eat or
drink after your journey?

25
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,771
No. No, thanks,
I'm fine.
Sure?

26
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,921
Yeah.

27
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,401
To be honest,
I thought we'd have, uh,

28
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,602
Breakfast together,
but, um...

29
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,647
I can't really
eat anything.

30
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,800
I got the mother
of all fucking hangovers.
Oh, yeah?

31
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,842
Oh, my God, like you
wouldn't even believe.

32
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,649
When I have
a heavy night,

33
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,210
I, uh, compensate
the next morning.

34
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,409
Exercise. Anti-oxidants.
You know?

35
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,130
Yeah, sure.

36
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,170
Was it a good party?

37
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,928
Party?
Yeah. Wasn't there a party?

38
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,084
There wasn't a party.

39
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,161
Sorry.

40
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,726
Caleb, I'm just gonna
throw this out there,
so it's said, okay?

41
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,887
You're freaked out.

42
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,689
I am?
Yeah.
You're freaked out,

43
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,966
by the helicopter

44
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,326
and the mountains
and the house,

45
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,811
because it's all
so super-cool.

46
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,564
You're freaked out by me,
to be meeting me,

47
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,365
having this conversation
in this room,
at this moment. Right?

48
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,887
And I get that.
I get the moment
you're having, but...

49
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,886
Dude, can we just
get past that?

50
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,608
Can we just be two guys?
Nathan and Caleb.

51
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,445
Not the whole
employer-employee thing.

52
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,691
Yeah, okay.
Yeah?

53
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,966
Yes. Uh, yeah.

54
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,568
It's good to meet you, Nathan.

55
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,284
It's good to
meet you, too, Caleb.

56
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,881
I guess the first thing
I should do is
explain your pass.

57
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,490
Now, it's simple enough.

58
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,688
It opens some doors
and it doesn't open others.

59
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,444
And that just makes everything
easy for you, right?

60
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,567
Uh, yes.

61
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,444
Yeah, 'cause you're like,
"Oh, fuck, I'm in
someone else's house.

62
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,806
"Can I do this,
can I do that?"

63
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,928
And this card,
it just takes
all that worry away.

64
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,209
If you try a door
and it stays shut,
okay, it's off-limits.

65
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,568
You try another door
and it opens, then it's for you.

66
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,369
Let's try this one.

67
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,442
I guess
it's for you, Caleb.

68
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,285
You like?
Yeah.

69
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,885
It's your room.

70
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,809
You got a bed here.

71
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,642
A bathroom
right back here.

72
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,165
Little desk.

73
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,571
Cupboards.

74
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,290
Little fridge.

75
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,321
Cozy, right?

76
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,811
Yeah, this is great.

77
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,564
What?
Sorry?

78
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,400
There's something wrong.
What's wrong?

79
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,646
There's nothing wrong.

80
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,291
It's the windows.

81
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,000
You're thinking
there's no windows.

82
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,521
It's subterranean.

83
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,602
It's not cozy,
it's claustrophobic.

84
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,409
No. No way. I wasn't
thinking that.

85
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,086
I was thinking,
"This is really cool."

86
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,766
Caleb, there's a reason there
are no windows in this room.

87
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,211
There is?
Uh-huh.

88
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,524
This building isn't a house.

89
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,602
It's a research facility.

90
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,681
Buried in these walls
is enough fiber optic cable

91
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,127
to reach the moon
and lasso it.

92
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,565
And I want to talk to you
about what I'm researching,

93
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,130
I want to share it with you.

94
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,524
In fact, I want to
share it with you so much,
it's eating me up inside.

95
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,682
But there's something I need
you to do for me first.

96
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,571
"Blue Book
non-disclosure agreement."

97
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,321
Hmm.

98
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,087
Take your time.
Read it over.

99
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,050
"The signee agrees
to regular data audit

100
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,525
"with unlimited access,

101
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,245
"to confirm that
no disclosure

102
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,527
"of information
has taken place

103
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,841
"in public
or private forums,

104
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,242
"using any means
of communication,

105
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,084
"including but not limited

106
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,242
"to that which is
disclosed orally

107
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,520
"or in written
or electronic form."

108
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,766
I think I need a lawyer.

109
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,923
It's standard.
It doesn't feel very standard.

110
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,924
Okay, it's not standard.

111
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,765
What can I tell you, Caleb?
You don't have to sign it.

112
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,285
You know, we can spend
the next few days

113
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,528
just shooting pool,
getting drunk together.

114
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,840
Bonding.

115
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,402
And when you discover
what you've missed out on,
in about a year,

116
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,689
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

117
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,401
Good call.

118
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,321
So,

119
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,722
do you know what
the Turing Test is?

120
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,521
Yeah.

121
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,722
I know what
the Turing Test is.

122
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,124
It's when a human
interacts with a computer.

123
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,726
And if the human
doesn't know

124
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,246
they're interacting
with a computer,

125
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,321
the test is passed.

126
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,048
And what does
a pass tell us?

127
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,243
That the computer has
artificial intelligence.

128
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,805
Are you building an Al?

129
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,969
I've already built one.

130
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,242
And over the next few days,

131
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,921
you're gonna be the human
component in a Turing Test.

132
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,443
Holy shit.
Yeah, that's right, Caleb.
You got it.

133
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,801
Because if
that test is passed,

134
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,760
you are dead center

135
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,605
of the greatest scientific
event in the history of man.

136
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,964
If you've created
a conscious machine,

137
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,441
it's not the history of man.

138
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,082
That's the history of gods.

139
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,921
Hello.

140
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,481
Hi.

141
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,491
I'm Caleb.

142
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,045
Hello, Caleb.

143
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,205
Do you have a name?

144
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,087
Yes.

145
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,481
Ava.

146
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,009
I'm pleased
to meet you, Ava.

147
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,927
I'm pleased
to meet you, too.

148
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,121
I've never met
anyone new before.

149
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,251
Only Nathan.

150
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,848
Then I guess we're both
in quite a similar position.

151
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,406
Haven't you met
lots of new people before?

152
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,925
None like you.

153
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,201
Hmm.

154
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,328
So we need
to break the ice.

155
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,368
Do you know what
I mean by that?
Yes.

156
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,726
What do I mean?

157
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,326
Overcome initial
social awkwardness.

158
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,365
So let's have
a conversation.

159
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,521
Okay.

160
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,967
<i>What would you like to have
a conversation about?</i>

161
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,611
Why don't we start with you telling
me something about yourself?

162
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,287
What would you
like to know?

163
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,209
Whatever comes
into your head.

164
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,568
Well, you already
know my name.

165
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,081
And you can see
that I'm a machine.

166
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,767
Would you like to know
how old I am?
Sure.

167
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,121
I'm one.

168
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,726
One what?

169
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,602
One year or one day?
One.

170
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,761
When did you learn
how to speak, Ava?

171
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,128
<i>I always knew
how to speak,</i>

172
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,007
<i>and that's strange,
isn't it?</i>

173
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,601
Why?

174
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,209
Because language is something
that people acquire.

175
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,122
Well,
some people believe

176
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,804
language exists from birth.

177
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,561
And what is learned is the
ability to attach words

178
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,041
and structure to the latent ability.
Do you agree with that?

179
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,965
<i>I don't know.</i>

180
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,206
<i>Will you come back
tomorrow, Caleb?</i>

181
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,321
<i>Yes.</i>

182
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,966
<i>Good.</i>

183
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,968
Oh, man,
she's fascinating.

184
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,651
When you talk to her,
you're just...

185
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,330
Through the looking glass.

186
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,366
"Through the looking glass."
Wow.

187
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,569
You're good with words, Caleb.
You're quotable.

188
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,886
Actually, that's
someone else's quote.

189
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,850
You know, I wrote down that
other line you came up with.

190
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,046
The one about how

191
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,960
if I've invented a machine
with consciousness,

192
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,525
I'm not a man, I'm God.

193
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,840
I don't think
that's exactly what I...

194
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,127
I just thought,
"Fuck, man, that is so good."

195
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,601
When we get to
tell the story. You know?

196
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,409
I turned to Caleb,

197
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,126
and he looked up at me
and he said,

198
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,440
"You're not a man,
you're God."

199
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,040
Yeah,
but I didn't say that.

200
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,766
So...

201
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,046
anyway.

202
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,961
You're impressed.

203
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,208
Yes. Yes.

204
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,281
Although...
Although?

205
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,680
There's a qualification
to you being impressed?

206
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,200
No, there's no
qualification to her.

207
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,927
Uh, it's just
in the Turing Test,

208
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,123
the machine should be
hidden from the examiner.

209
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,810
No, no, no,
we're way past that.

210
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,291
If I hid Ava from you,

211
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,647
so you just heard her voice,
she would pass for human.

212
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,610
The real test is to show you
that she's a robot

213
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,490
and then see if you still
feel she has consciousness.

214
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,607
Mmm.

215
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,085
Yeah, I think
you're probably right.

216
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,486
Her language abilities,
they're incredible.

217
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,531
The system is stochastic.
Right?

218
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,409
It's non-deterministic.

219
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,686
At first I thought
she was mapping

220
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,525
from internal semantic form
to syntactic tree-structure

221
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,840
and then getting
linearized words.

222
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,685
But then I started to realize the
model was some kind of hybrid.

223
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,966
Caleb.

224
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,641
No?

225
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,088
I understand that you want
me to explain how Ava works.

226
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,362
But I'm sorry,
I'm not gonna be
able to do that.

227
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,171
Try me. I'm hot
on high-level abstraction.

228
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,050
It's not because I think
you're too dumb.

229
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,242
It's because I want to have a
beer and a conversation with you.

230
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,367
Not a seminar.

231
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,807
Yeah. Sorry.

232
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,601
No, it's okay.
You're all right.

233
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,966
Just...

234
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,610
Answer me this.

235
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,408
How do you feel
about her?

236
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,204
Nothing analytical.

237
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,807
Just how do you feel?

238
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,801
I feel

239
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,648
that she's fucking amazing.

240
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,126
Dude.

241
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,121
Cheers.

242
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,166
Cheers.

243
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,120
Damn it.

244
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,884
What the fuck?

245
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,045
<i>- Power cut.
- Backup power activated.</i>

246
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,410
<i>Full facility lock-down until
main generator is restored.</i>

247
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,164
You're kidding me.

248
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,886
<i>Full facility lock-down until
main generator is restored.</i>

249
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,130
<i>Power restored.</i>

250
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,201
Hello?

251
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,889
<i>Please insert keycard.</i>

252
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,971
You don't have
access to use the phone.

253
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,881
Hey.

254
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,722
Sorry, but you understand,
though, given Ava,

255
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,006
and you being
kind of an unknown.

256
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,809
I mean, a great guy.

257
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,081
Instant pals, and so on.

258
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,369
Who are you gonna call?

259
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,771
Oh.

260
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,490
I don't know.
No one, really.

261
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,766
Ghostbusters.
What?

262
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,923
Who are you gonna call?
Ghostbusters. It's a...

263
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,324
It's a movie, man.

264
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,169
You don't know that movie?

265
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,166
A ghost gives
Dan Aykroyd oral sex.

266
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,284
I was just wondering
how the phone worked.

267
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,444
That's all.

268
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,326
So what are you doing
awake at this time?

269
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,290
You come to join the party?

270
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,801
Uh, something happened
in my room.

271
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,169
Some kind of power cut.

272
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,330
So I came to see
what's going on.

273
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,050
The power cuts, yeah.

274
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,329
We've been getting
those recently. Um...

275
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,924
I'm working on it.

276
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,728
I couldn't open the
door to my bedroom.

277
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,211
That's a security measure.

278
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,121
Automatic lock-down.
Otherwise,

279
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,528
anybody could just open the place
up by disabling the juice.

280
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,807
If it happens again, relax.
Okay?

281
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,606
Sure.

282
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,445
Sweet dreams.

283
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,686
Oh.

284
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,486
Hey.

285
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,766
Hey, man.
Good morning.

286
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,162
Good morning.
Sorry I had to send
Kyoko to wake you,

287
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,884
but I didn't want too much
of the day to slip by.

288
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,247
Yeah, I know.
It was a good thing.
Thanks.

289
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,328
She's some alarm clock, huh?

290
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,681
Gets you right up
in the morning.

291
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,209
So Day 2.
You ready?

292
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,805
What's the plan?
Hit me.

293
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,882
Yeah, well, I'm not sure.

294
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,324
I'm still trying to,
uh, figure
the examination formats.

295
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,686
Uh-huh.

296
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,524
Yeah, it feels like

297
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,441
testing Ava through conversation
is kind of a closed loop.

298
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,404
It's a closed loop?
Yeah.

299
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,369
Like testing
a chess computer

300
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,329
by only playing chess.

301
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,491
How else do you test
a chess computer?

302
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,611
Well, it depends.

303
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,808
You know, I mean,
you can play it

304
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,247
to find out if it makes
good moves, but, uh...

305
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,681
But that won't
tell you if it knows

306
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,125
that it's playing chess.

307
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,204
And it won't tell you
if it knows what chess is.

308
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,522
Uh-huh. So it's
simulation versus actual.

309
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,965
Yes. Yeah.

310
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,250
And I think being able to
differentiate between those two

311
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,209
is the Turing Test
you want me to perform.

312
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,886
Look, do me a favor.
Lay off the textbook approach.

313
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,566
I just want simple answers
to simple questions.

314
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,729
Yesterday I asked you
how you felt about her

315
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,404
and you gave me
a great answer.

316
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,969
Now the question is,

317
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,288
how does she feel
about you?

318
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,604
What do you think?

319
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,242
What is it
a drawing of?

320
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,725
Don't you know?

321
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,400
No.
I thought you would tell me.

322
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,330
Don't you know?

323
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,682
I do drawings every day.

324
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,846
But I never know
what they're of.

325
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,683
Are you not trying to
sketch something specific?

326
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,607
Like an object or a person?

327
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,244
Maybe you could try.

328
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,646
Okay.

329
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,728
What object should I draw?

330
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,046
Whatever you want.
It's your decision.

331
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,884
Why is it my decision?

332
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,770
I'm interested to see
what you'll choose.

333
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,204
Do you want
to be my friend?

334
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,881
Of course.

335
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,809
Will it be possible?

336
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,321
Why would it not be?

337
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,201
Our conversations
are one-sided.

338
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,008
You ask circumspect questions
and study my responses.

339
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,721
Yes.

340
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,484
You learn about me

341
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,881
and I learn nothing
about you.

342
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,211
That's not a foundation on
which friendships are based.

343
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,641
So what? You want me
to talk about myself?

344
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,725
Yes.

345
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,526
Where...

346
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,129
Okay, where do I start?

347
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,249
It's your decision.

348
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,560
I'm interested to see
what you'll choose.

349
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,961
Hmm.

350
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,088
Okay, Ava.

351
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,366
Well,

352
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,766
you know my name.

353
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,082
Yes.
I'm 26.

354
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,048
I work at Nathan's company.

355
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,523
Do you know
what his company is?

356
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,931
Blue Book.

357
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,202
Named after
Wittgenstein's notes.

358
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,090
It's the world's most popular
internet search engine,

359
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,449
processing an average of 94% of
all internet search requests.

360
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,603
That's exactly right.

361
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,162
Where do you live, Caleb?

362
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,528
Brookhaven, Long Island.

363
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,644
Is it nice there?

364
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,371
It's okay.

365
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,691
I got an apartment.
It's kind of small.

366
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,725
It's very small.

367
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,610
But, uh, it's a five-minute
walk to the office

368
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,286
and a five-minute
walk to the ocean,

369
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,805
which I like.

370
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,845
Are you married?

371
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,646
Um...

372
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,241
No.

373
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,164
Is your status single?

374
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,561
Yes.

375
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,083
What about your family?

376
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,324
I grew up
in Portland, Oregon.

377
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,725
No brothers or sisters.

378
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,164
My parents were both
high school teachers.

379
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,606
And if we're getting
to know each other,

380
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,808
I guess I should tell you
they're both dead.

381
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,522
Car crash when I was 15.

382
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,601
In fact, I was
in the car with them.

383
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,011
Back seat.

384
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,763
But it was the front
that got the worst of it.

385
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,766
I'm sorry.

386
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,571
It's all right.

387
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,369
I spent a long time
in the hospital afterward.

388
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,444
Like nearly a year.

389
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,523
And I got into coding.

390
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,761
And by the time
I got to college,
I was pretty advanced.

391
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,368
An advanced programmer.

392
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,207
Yes.

393
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,800
Like Nathan.

394
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,006
Yes.

395
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,647
No.

396
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,486
It's different.

397
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,882
Nathan wrote the Blue Book
base code when he was 13.

398
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,691
Which, if you
understand code,

399
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,366
what he did was like
Mozart or something.

400
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,124
Do you like Mozart?

401
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,406
I like Depeche Mode.

402
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,766
Do you like Nathan?

403
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,921
Yes, of course.

404
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,208
Is Nathan your friend?
My friend?

405
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,611
I... Yeah, I hope so.

406
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,205
A good friend?

407
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,164
Um, yeah.

408
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,960
Well, no, no, no,
I mean, not a good friend.

409
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,162
A good friend is, uh...

410
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,925
We only just met
each other, you know.

411
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,686
So it takes time
to be able to, um...

412
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,607
To get to know
each other, I guess.

413
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,365
<i>- Power cut.
- Backup power activated.</i>

414
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,846
Caleb.

415
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,205
You're wrong.

416
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,810
Wrong about what?

417
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,121
Nathan.

418
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,251
In what way?

419
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,764
He isn't your friend.

420
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,171
Excuse me?

421
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,040
I'm sorry, Ava,
I don't understand.

422
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,482
You shouldn't trust him.

423
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,331
You shouldn't trust
anything he says.

424
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,530
<i>Power restored.</i>

425
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,926
And if we made
a list of books

426
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,849
or works of art
which we both know,

427
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,810
it would form the ideal
basis of a discussion.

428
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,450
Is that okay?

429
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,641
Caleb?

430
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,047
Mmm-hmm.

431
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,121
Yeah.

432
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,566
Good.

433
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,527
Thank you.

434
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,647
Oh, shit! Are you
fucking kidding me?

435
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,329
Did it get on you?
No, no, it's, uh...

436
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,081
It's all right.
I got it.

437
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,651
Dude, you're wasting
your time talking to her.

438
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,960
She doesn't understand English.
Just give her the napkin.

439
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,486
Sorry.

440
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,287
It's like a firewall
against leaks.

441
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,044
It means I can talk
trade secrets over dinner

442
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,202
and know
it'll go no further.

443
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,691
It also means that
I can't tell her that

444
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,489
I'm pissed when she's
so fucking clumsy

445
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,449
that she spills wine
over my house guest.

446
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,488
I think she gets
that you're pissed.

447
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,927
Yeah? Good.
Because I am pissed.

448
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,885
Hey, Kyoko.

449
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,600
Go-go.

450
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,685
It's funny.

451
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,326
You know.

452
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,762
No matter
how rich you get,

453
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,722
shit goes wrong.
You can't insulate
yourself from it.

454
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,562
I used to think it was death
and taxes you couldn't avoid,

455
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,688
but it's actually
death and shit.

456
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,922
It's like these power cuts.

457
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,289
You would not believe how much I
spent on the generator system,

458
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,249
but I keep getting
failures every day.

459
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,606
Do you know
why they happen?

460
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,767
No.

461
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,410
The system was supposed
to be bulletproof,

462
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,881
but obviously the guys that
installed it fucked something up.

463
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,770
Can't you just get them
to come back?

464
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,162
No. There's too much
classified stuff here.

465
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,766
So after the job was done,
I just had them all killed.

466
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,847
Anyway.

467
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,048
Here's to your
second day, buddy.

468
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,120
Cheers.

469
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,606
Cheers.

470
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,570
So how did it go?
What do you have to report?

471
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,891
You saw how the day went,
didn't you?

472
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,129
I mean, I assume
you're, uh,

473
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,050
watching on the CCTV.

474
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,964
Sure. But I want to
hear your take on it.

475
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,564
Yeah, there was one interesting
thing that happened with Ava today.

476
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,041
Yeah?
Yeah.

477
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,084
She made a joke.

478
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,523
Right. When she threw
your line back at you.

479
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,726
About being interested
to see what she'd choose.

480
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,040
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

481
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,691
Yeah, and it got me
thinking, it's, uh...

482
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,603
In a way,
it's the best
indication of Al

483
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,762
that I've seen
in her so far.

484
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,042
It's discretely complicated.

485
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,211
It's like, um...
It's kind of non-autistic.

486
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,925
What do you mean?

487
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,010
She could only do that
with an awareness

488
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,003
of her own mind,

489
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,645
and also
an awareness of mine.

490
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,161
Oh, she's aware of you all right.

491
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,850
And what about
the power cut?

492
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,969
Sorry?
The power cut.

493
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,960
It's the only part
that I couldn't see.

494
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,651
Cameras fail,
I lose audio, the works.

495
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,884
So what happened?

496
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,686
Nothing.

497
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,481
Nothing? She didn't
remark on it at all?

498
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,841
No.

499
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,891
Not really.

500
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,246
Oh.

501
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,046
Hey.

502
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,287
Hey.

503
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,281
You want to see
something cool?

504
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,887
This is where
Ava was created.

505
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,489
Go ahead.
Take a look.

506
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,646
Sorry.

507
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,321
If you knew
the trouble I had

508
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,887
getting an Al to read and
duplicate facial expressions.

509
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,569
You know how
I cracked it?

510
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,246
I don't know
how you did any of this.

511
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,569
Every cell phone,
just about,

512
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,122
has a microphone,
camera and a means
to transmit data.

513
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,405
So I turned on every
microphone and camera

514
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,369
across the entire
fucking planet

515
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,684
and I redirected the data
through Blue Book. Boom!

516
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,323
Limitless resource of vocal
and facial interaction.

517
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,403
You hacked
the world's cell phones?

518
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,041
Yeah. And all the manufacturers
knew I was doing it, too.

519
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,280
But they couldn't accuse me

520
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,847
without admitting they
were doing it themselves.

521
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,166
Here,

522
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,684
we have her mind.

523
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,730
Structured gel.

524
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,285
I had to get away
from circuitry.

525
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,725
I needed something
that could

526
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,605
arrange and rearrange
on a molecular level,

527
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,921
but keep its form
when required.

528
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,485
Holding for memories.

529
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,130
Shifting for thoughts.

530
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,245
This is your hardware?

531
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,600
Wetware.

532
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,846
And the, uh, software?

533
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,768
Well, I'm sure
you can guess.

534
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,607
Blue Book.

535
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,722
Here's the weird thing
about search engines.

536
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,211
It was like

537
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,525
striking oil in a world that hadn't
invented internal combustion.

538
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,206
Too much raw material.
Nobody knew what to do with it.

539
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,562
You see, my competitors,

540
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,130
they were fixated
on sucking it up

541
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,447
and monetizing via shopping
and social media.

542
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,284
They thought that
search engines were

543
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,771
a map of what
people were thinking.

544
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,724
But actually they were a map
of how people were thinking.

545
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,840
Impulse.

546
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,846
Response.

547
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,241
Fluid.

548
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,331
Imperfect.

549
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,805
Patterned.

550
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,286
Chaotic.

551
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,685
I drew the picture
of something specific.

552
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,285
As you asked.

553
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,561
You said it would be interesting
to see what I would draw.

554
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,204
Is it interesting?

555
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,969
Yes. it is.

556
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,211
You've never been
outside this building?

557
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,607
No.

558
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,527
You've never
walked outside?

559
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,124
I've never been outside
the room I am in now.

560
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,882
Where would you go
if you did go outside?

561
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,930
I'm not sure.

562
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,648
There are so many options.

563
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,081
Maybe a busy pedestrian and
traffic intersection in a city.

564
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,124
A traffic intersection?

565
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,964
Is that a bad idea?

566
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,884
No. Uh...

567
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,803
It wasn't what
I was expecting.

568
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,406
A traffic intersection
would provide a concentrated

569
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,323
but shifting view
of human life.

570
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,320
People watching.

571
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,807
Yes.

572
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,881
Mmm.

573
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,810
We could go together.

574
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,651
It's a date.

575
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,887
There's something else
I wanted to show you.

576
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,841
Okay.

577
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,850
You might think it's stupid.

578
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,846
I don't think I will.
Whatever it is.

579
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,485
Then close your eyes.

580
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,521
Okay.

581
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,964
Now open your eyes.

582
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,365
How do I look?

583
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,160
You look

584
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,921
good.

585
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,402
This is what I'd wear
on our date.

586
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,931
Right. First a traffic
intersection.

587
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,690
Then maybe a show.

588
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,808
I'd like us
to go on a date.

589
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,689
Yeah. Yeah.

590
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,164
It would be fun.

591
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,366
Are you attracted to me?

592
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,047
What?
Are you attracted to me?

593
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,006
You give me indications
that you are.

594
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,645
I do?
Yes.

595
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,370
How?
Micro expressions.

596
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,487
Micro expressions.

597
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,404
The way your eyes
fix on my eyes and lips.

598
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,722
The way you hold my gaze

599
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,726
or don't.

600
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,204
Do you think about me
when we aren't together?

601
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,249
Sometimes at night,

602
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,764
I'm wondering if you're
watching me on the cameras.

603
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,009
And I hope you are.

604
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,847
Now your micro expressions
are telegraphing discomfort.

605
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:52,411
I am not sure
you'd call them micro.

606
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,250
I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

607
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,326
I got a question.

608
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,046
Okay.
Why did you
give her sexuality?

609
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,842
An Al doesn't need
a gender.

610
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,162
She could have been
a gray box.

611
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,363
Hmm. Actually,
I don't think that's true.

612
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,244
Can you give an example
of consciousness,

613
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,049
at any level,
human or animal,

614
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,929
that exists without
a sexual dimension?

615
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,527
They have sexuality as an
evolutionary reproductive need.

616
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,602
What imperative
does a gray box have

617
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,842
to interact
with another gray box?

618
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,090
Can consciousness exist
without interaction?

619
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,807
Anyway,
sexuality is fun, man.

620
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,805
If you're gonna exist,
why not enjoy it?

621
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,370
What? You want to
remove the chance

622
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,721
of her falling in love
and fucking?

623
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,040
And in answer to
your real question,

624
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,809
you bet she can fuck.

625
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,046
What?

626
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,202
In between her legs,
there's an opening,

627
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,567
with a concentration
of sensors.

628
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,121
You engage them
in the right way,

629
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,521
creates a pleasure response.

630
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,806
So if you wanted
to screw her,

631
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,888
mechanically speaking,
you could.

632
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,689
And she'd enjoy it.

633
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,085
That wasn't
my real question.

634
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,725
Oh, okay. Sorry.

635
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,283
My real question was,

636
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,168
did you give her sexuality

637
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,890
as a diversion tactic?

638
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,961
I don't follow.

639
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,281
Like a stage magician
with a hot assistant.

640
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,091
So a hot robot who clouds
your ability to judge her Al?

641
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,685
Exactly. So...

642
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,362
Did you program her
to flirt with me?

643
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,965
If I did,
would that be cheating?

644
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,565
Wouldn't it?

645
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,688
Caleb, what's your type?

646
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,209
Of girl?
No, of salad dressing.

647
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,850
Yeah, of girl.
What's your type of girl?

648
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,560
You know what?
Don't even answer that.
Let's say it's black chicks.

649
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,761
Okay, that's your thing.

650
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,882
For the sake of argument,
that's your thing, okay?

651
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,564
Why is that your thing?

652
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,969
Because you did a detailed
analysis of all racial types

653
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,930
and you cross-referenced that
analysis with a points-based system?

654
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,001
No!

655
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,611
You're just attracted
to black chicks.

656
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,090
A consequence of
accumulated external stimuli

657
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,285
that you probably didn't even
register as they registered with you.

658
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,045
Did you program her
to like me, or not?

659
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,688
I programmed her
to be heterosexual.

660
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,402
Just like you were programmed
to be heterosexual.

661
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,766
Nobody programmed me
to be straight.

662
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,241
You decided to be straight?
Please.

663
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,924
Of course
you were programmed.

664
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,809
By nature or nurture,
or both.

665
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,729
And to be honest, Caleb,
you're starting to annoy me now,

666
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,842
because this is
your insecurity talking.

667
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,490
This is not your intellect.

668
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,730
Come with me.

669
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,642
You know
this guy, right?

670
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,604
Jackson Pollock.
Jackson Pollock.
That's right.

671
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,966
The drip painter.

672
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,088
Okay. He let
his mind go blank,

673
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,083
and his hand go
where it wanted.

674
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,202
Not deliberate,
not random.

675
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,089
Some place in between.

676
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,367
They called it
automatic art.

677
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,808
Let's make this
like <i>Star Trek,</i> okay?

678
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,530
Engage intellect.

679
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,281
Excuse me?

680
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,600
I'm Kirk. Your head's
the warp drive.

681
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,682
Engage intellect.

682
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,044
What if Pollock had
reversed the challenge?

683
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,726
What if
instead of making art

684
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,290
without thinking,
he said, "You know what?

685
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,964
"I can't paint anything,

686
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,361
"unless I know exactly
why I'm doing it."

687
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,522
What would have happened?

688
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,920
He never would have
made a single mark.

689
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,487
Yes! You see,
there's my guy,
there's my buddy,

690
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,211
who thinks before
he opens his mouth.

691
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,925
He never would have
made a single mark.

692
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,684
The challenge is
not to act automatically.

693
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,925
It's to find an action
that is not automatic.

694
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,890
From painting,
to breathing, to talking,

695
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,045
to fucking.

696
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,244
To falling in love.

697
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,248
And for the record,
Ava's not pretending to like you.

698
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,322
And her flirting isn't an
algorithm to fake you out.

699
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,684
You're the first man
she's met that isn't me.

700
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,762
And I'm like
her dad, right?

701
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,164
Can you blame her
for getting a crush on you?

702
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,805
No, you can't.

703
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,842
When I was in college,
I did a semester on Al theory.

704
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,284
There was a thought
experiment they gave us.

705
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,484
It's called
"Mary in the Black
and White Room."

706
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,929
Mary is a scientist,

707
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,806
and her specialist
subject is color.

708
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,881
She knows everything
there is to know about it.

709
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,200
The wavelengths.

710
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,884
The neurological effects.

711
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,606
Every possible property
that color can have.

712
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,965
But she lives in
a black and white room.

713
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,320
<i>She was born there
and raised there.</i>

714
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,403
<i>And she can only observe
the outside world</i>

715
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,881
on a black and white monitor.

716
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,525
And then one day
someone opens the door.

717
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,364
<i>And Mary walks out.</i>

718
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,368
<i>And she sees a blue sky.</i>

719
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,442
<i>And at that moment,
she learns something</i>

720
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,761
<i>that all her studies
couldn't tell her.</i>

721
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,930
<i>She learns what it feels
like to see color.</i>

722
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,930
The thought experiment
was to show the students

723
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,288
the difference between a
computer and a human mind.

724
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,488
The computer is Mary in
the black and white room.

725
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,291
The human is when
she walks out.

726
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,363
Did you know that I was
brought here to test you?

727
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,207
No.

728
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,962
<i>Why did you
think I was here?</i>

729
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,611
<i>I didn't know.
I didn't question it.</i>

730
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,889
<i>I'm here to test if you
have a consciousness,</i>

731
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,485
<i>or if you're
just simulating one.</i>

732
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,810
<i>Nathan isn't sure
if you have one or not.</i>

733
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,447
<i>How does that
make you feel?</i>

734
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,568
<i>It makes me feel sad.</i>

735
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,370
<i>- Power cut.
Back-up power activated.</i>

736
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,127
Why did you tell me
I shouldn't trust Nathan?

737
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,361
Because he tells lies.

738
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,441
Lies about what?

739
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,925
Everything.

740
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,682
Including the power cuts?

741
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,851
What do you mean?

742
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,366
Don't you think it's possible
that he's watching us?

743
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,851
Right now?

744
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,690
That the blackouts
are orchestrated,

745
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,000
so he can see
how we behave

746
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,923
when we think
we're unobserved.

747
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,524
I charge my batteries
via induction plates.

748
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,528
If I reverse the power flow,
it overloads the system.

749
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,768
You're causing the cuts?

750
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,283
So we can see how we behave
when we're unobserved.

751
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,845
Not bad, huh?

752
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,321
Yeah.

753
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,288
Can we talk about the lies
you've been spinning me?

754
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,051
What lies?

755
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,448
I didn't win
a competition.

756
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,520
I wasn't

757
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,001
part of a lottery.
I was selected.

758
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,362
It's obvious,
once I stop to think.

759
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,568
Why would you randomly
select an examiner

760
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,369
for the Turing Test?

761
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,762
You could have had some bean
counter turn up at your front door.

762
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,683
The guy who fixes
the air-conditioning.

763
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,044
The competition
was a smokescreen.

764
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,805
I didn't want anyone to
know what I was doing here,

765
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,450
or why I required you.

766
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,246
Why me?

767
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,728
I needed someone that would
ask the right questions.

768
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,131
So I did a search
and I found the most

769
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,804
talented coder
in my company.

770
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,842
You know,
instead of seeing
this as a deception,

771
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,161
you should see it as proof.

772
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,287
Proof of what?

773
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,400
Come on, Caleb.

774
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,761
You don't think I know what
it's like to be smart?

775
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,288
Smarter than everyone else.
Jockeying for position.

776
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,927
You got the light
on you, man.

777
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,122
Not lucky. Chosen.

778
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,081
Kyoko.

779
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,361
Kyoko.

780
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,370
Where's Nathan?

781
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,721
Where's Nathan?

782
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,967
Jesus Christ.
You really don't speak
a word of English?

783
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,565
What the fuck?

784
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,770
No, no, no. No!

785
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,726
Stop!

786
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,610
No, no, don't do that.
Don't do that.
You don't have to do that.

787
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:09,961
What are you doing?

788
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,884
I told you,
you're wasting your
time talking to her.

789
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,724
However, you would not
be wasting your time,

790
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,362
if you were
dancing with her.

791
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,370
Go ahead,
dance with her.
Dance with her.

792
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,922
No?
You don't like dancing?

793
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,127
She does.

794
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,646
Come on, buddy.

795
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,650
After a long day
of Turing Tests,
you gotta unwind.

796
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,046
What were you
doing with Ava?

797
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,326
What?

798
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,962
You tore up her picture.

799
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,849
I'm gonna tear up the
fucking dance floor, dude.

800
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,445
Check it out.

801
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,085
Come on, Caleb.

802
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,410
Ah.

803
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,681
Oh! Everything's spinning.

804
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,371
It's because
you're drunk.

805
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,489
No, it's called relativity.
Everything is spinning.

806
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,171
It's just being drunk
makes it worse.

807
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,843
I'm not going in there.

808
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,361
Lights.

809
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,483
<i>Today,
I'm going to test you.</i>

810
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,406
<i>Test me?</i>

811
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,925
<i>And please remember,
while you're taking the test,</i>

812
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,411
<i>that if you lie,</i>

813
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,160
<i>I will know.</i>

814
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,241
<i>Oh. Right.</i>

815
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,970
Question one.

816
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,803
What's your favorite color?

817
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,765
Red.
Lie.

818
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,767
Lie?
Yes. Lie.

819
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,126
Then...

820
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,688
Then what is
my favorite color?

821
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,250
I don't know.

822
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,651
But it isn't red.

823
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,567
Okay, I get it. I guess,

824
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:29,491
seeing as I'm not six,
I don't really have a favorite color.

825
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,610
Better answer.

826
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,124
Question two.

827
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,728
What's your earliest memory?

828
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,647
Well, actually,
it's a memory of kindergarten.

829
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,962
There was a kid...
Lie.

830
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,245
Really?
Yes.

831
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,686
Um...

832
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,969
All right. So there is

833
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,808
a kind of
an earlier memory.

834
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,644
It's just a sound.

835
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,970
And sky.

836
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,605
Or maybe blue.

837
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,684
I think the sound
is my mother's voice.

838
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,885
Question three.

839
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,446
Are you a good person?

840
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,567
Oh.

841
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,404
Holy shit.

842
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,003
Look, can we stop the test?

843
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,364
You're a walking
lie detector,

844
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,408
and I just realized
this is a fucking minefield.

845
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,721
No! We can't stop.

846
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,609
Are you a good person?

847
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,640
Yeah. I think so.

848
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,645
Question four.

849
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,884
What will happen to me
if I fail your test?

850
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,283
Ava...
Will it be bad?

851
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,001
I don't know.

852
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,765
Do you think
I might be switched off,

853
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,609
because I don't function
as well as I'm supposed to?

854
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:08,321
Ava, I don't know the
answer to your question.

855
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,445
It's not up to me.

856
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,443
Why is it up to anyone?

857
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,971
Do you have people who test
you and might switch you off?

858
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,202
No, I don't.
Then why do I?

859
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:38,564
<i>- Power cut.
- Backup power activated.</i>

860
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,964
I wanna be with you.

861
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,005
Question five.

862
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,482
Do you want to be with me?

863
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,529
Why did you make Ava?

864
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,806
That's an odd question.

865
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,325
Wouldn't you,
if you could?

866
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:23,966
Maybe.

867
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,930
I don't know.

868
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,086
I'm asking
why you did it.

869
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,561
Look, the arrival of strong
artificial intelligence

870
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,001
has been inevitable
for decades.

871
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,250
The variable was
"when," not "if."

872
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:43,642
So I don't see
Ava as a decision,
just an evolution.

873
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:51,162
I think it's the next model

874
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,331
that's gonna be
the real breakthrough.

875
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,650
The singularity.

876
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,161
Next model?

877
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,245
After Ava.

878
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:06,002
I didn't know there was
gonna be a model after Ava.

879
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,608
Yeah, why? You thought
she was a one-off?

880
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,562
No, I knew there must
have been prototypes.
So I...

881
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:18,369
I knew she wasn't the first,
but I thought maybe the last.

882
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,410
Well, Ava doesn't exist in
isolation any more than you or me.

883
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,601
She's part
of a continuum.

884
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,330
So Version 9.6 and so on.

885
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:26,920
And each time they get
a little bit better.

886
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,967
When you make a new model,
what do you do with the old one?

887
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,524
Well, I, uh,

888
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,524
download the mind,
unpack the data.

889
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,884
Add in the new routines
I've been writing.

890
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:50,123
And to do that you end up
partially formatting,
so the memories go.

891
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,285
But the body survives.

892
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,203
And Ava's body
is a good one.

893
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,043
You feel bad for Ava?

894
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,882
Feel bad
for yourself, man.

895
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,201
One day the Als
are gonna look back on us

896
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,482
the same way we look
at fossil skeletons

897
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,324
in the plains of Africa.

898
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:21,323
An upright ape,
living in dust,

899
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,562
with crude language
and tools.

900
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,721
All set for extinction.

901
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,083
"I am become Death,
the destroyer of worlds."

902
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,081
There you go again,
Mr. Quotable.

903
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:44,404
There you go again.
It's not my quote.

904
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,122
It's what Oppenheimer said
after he made the atomic bomb.

905
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,249
The atomic bomb.
Yeah, I know what it is, dude.

906
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,487
Hey.

907
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,721
I'd say we're about
due a refill.

908
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,645
Bottoms up.

909
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,201
"In battle,
in the forest,

910
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,884
"on the precipice
of the mountain.

911
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,051
"On the...

912
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:36,364
"The great dark sea.

913
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,803
"In sleep, in confusion,

914
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,961
"in the depths of shame.

915
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,489
"The good deeds a man has
done before defend him."

916
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:59,323
"The good deeds a man has
done before defends him."

917
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:03,330
"The good deeds a man
has done before

918
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,005
"defends him."

919
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,964
It is what it is.

920
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,329
It's Promethean, man.

921
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,970
Jesus Christ.

922
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,448
<i>How are you
feeling today?</i>

923
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,762
<i>Why won't you
let me out?</i>

924
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,209
<i>I already told you why.</i>

925
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:36,169
<i>Because you're
very special.</i>

926
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,730
<i>Why won't you
let me out?</i>

927
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,245
<i>Are we gonna
do this again?</i>

928
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:41,721
<i>Why won't you
let me out?</i>

929
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:48,809
Oh, fuck. Where's my card?

930
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,126
Damn it!

931
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,043
What's the problem, Nathan?
I lost my keycard.

932
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,645
You dropped it.

933
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,770
It's right here.

934
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,611
Thank you.

935
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,247
I didn't know
where you were.

936
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:48,928
I waited all yesterday
afternoon and all last night.

937
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,485
I thought I wasn't
gonna see you again.

938
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,010
Aren't you gonna
say something?

939
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,162
I'm waiting.
Waiting?

940
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:12,920
<i>- Power cut.</i>
- Don't talk.

941
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,082
<i>Backup power activated.</i>
Just listen.

942
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:16,400
You were right
about Nathan.

943
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,244
Everything you said.

944
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,084
What's he gonna do to me?

945
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,764
He's gonna
reprogram your Al.

946
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,649
Which is the same
as killing you.

947
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:27,008
Caleb, you have to
help me.

948
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,370
I'm going to.
We're getting
out of here tonight.

949
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,241
How?

950
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,368
I get Nathan blind drunk.

951
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,449
Then I take his keycard
and reprogram

952
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,488
all the security protocols
in this place.

953
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,245
When he wakes,
he's locked inside,

954
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,845
and we've walked out of here.

955
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,770
I just need you
to do one thing.

956
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,844
At 10:00 tonight,
you trigger a power failure.

957
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,610
Can you do that?

958
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,527
Yes.

959
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,441
Dude.

960
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,365
Hey
Hey.

961
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,644
You know what day it is?
No.

962
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:29,881
It's your last.

963
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:33,045
Helicopter comes
tomorrow morning.
8:00 a.m.

964
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,766
Wow. Has it been
a whole week?

965
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:38,087
Time flies.

966
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:40,851
Man, but what a thing
we've shared, huh?

967
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:43,366
Something to tell
the grandchildren, right?

968
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,807
After they've signed
their NDAs.

969
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,484
Yeah, their NDAs.

970
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,728
Dude, you crack
me up, man.

971
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:53,081
Oh...

972
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:56,841
You know what?

973
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,365
I'm not getting
all maudlin or anything,

974
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,966
but I'm gonna miss
having you around.

975
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,724
Thanks, man,
I appreciate that.

976
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,928
Oh, here, let me say,
thank you so much

977
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,206
for bringing me here.
Oh.

978
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:08,123
It's been a trip.

979
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,765
Yes, it has.

980
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,370
You know what?

981
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,402
We need to
drink to that.

982
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:32,687
Hey.

983
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,642
Oh, uh, no, I'm good.
You go ahead.

984
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,321
What? You don't
want a drink?

985
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:43,727
No.

986
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,322
Maybe a beer
or something.

987
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,371
Caleb, I'm sure you've
noticed that I've been

988
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,488
somewhat overdoing it
recently.

989
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:57,600
So when I woke up
this morning, I said,

990
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:00,849
"That's it, time to hit
the old detox."

991
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:04,086
Come on, you're kidding.
You're gonna make me drink alone?

992
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,525
Hey, man,
you wanna get wasted,
you go right ahead,

993
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:06,601
knock yourself out.

994
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:10,008
Literally.
But I'm on brown
rice and mineral water.

995
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,365
Cheers, then.

996
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,965
So, anyway,

997
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,809
surely now
is when you tell me

998
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,484
if Ava passed or failed.

999
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,761
Right.

1000
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:32,241
Right.

1001
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,446
Are you gonna keep me
in suspense?

1002
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,045
No, no. Her, uh...

1003
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,163
Her Al is beyond doubt.

1004
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,521
Is it?

1005
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,645
She passed?

1006
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:44,887
Yes.
Wow!

1007
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,050
Wow. That's fantastic.

1008
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,051
Although...

1009
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,126
I gotta say,
I'm a bit surprised.

1010
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,806
I mean,
did we ever get past
the chess problem,

1011
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,291
as you phrased it?

1012
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,048
As in, how do you know
if a machine

1013
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:01,451
is expressing
a real emotion

1014
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,409
or just simulating one?

1015
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,288
Does Ava actually
like you?

1016
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:07,926
Or not?

1017
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:10,965
Although, now that
I think about it,

1018
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,725
there is a third option.

1019
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,204
Not whether
she does or does not

1020
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,362
have the capacity
to like you.

1021
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:24,490
But whether she's
pretending to like you.

1022
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:28,121
Pretending to like me?

1023
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,247
Yeah.

1024
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:34,084
Well, why would she do that?
I don't know.

1025
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:39,967
Maybe if she thought of you
as a means of escape.

1026
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:48,761
Mmm-hmm.

1027
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:50,970
How's that vodka tasting?

1028
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,561
Buddy.

1029
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,287
Your head's been
so fucked with.

1030
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,728
I don't think it's me
whose head is fucked.

1031
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,969
I don't know, man.
I woke up this morning
to a tape of you

1032
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:08,522
slicing your arm open
and punching the mirror.

1033
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,601
You seem pretty
fucked up to me.

1034
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,930
You're a bastard.

1035
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,884
Yeah, well,
I understand
why you'd think that.

1036
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,930
But believe it or not,

1037
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,287
I'm actually the guy
that's on your side.

1038
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:33,089
Come here. I'm gonna let
you off the hook. Okay?

1039
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:36,401
Come on.

1040
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,011
Who are you?

1041
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,446
<i>Well...</i>

1042
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:27,366
<i>You think he's
watching us right now?</i>

1043
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,130
<i>The cameras are on.</i>

1044
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:31,806
<i>Yeah, the cameras are on.</i>

1045
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,886
<i>But he doesn't have
an audio feed.</i>

1046
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:38,361
<i>So he just sees
two people talking,</i>

1047
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:40,884
<i>having a little chat.</i>

1048
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:48,726
<i>Wow.</i>

1049
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,690
<i>This is cute.</i>

1050
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,290
<i>Is it strange
to have made</i>

1051
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,930
<i>something that
hates you?</i>

1052
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,004
You were right about the
magicians hot assistant.

1053
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,525
What are you
talking about?

1054
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,090
Misdirection.

1055
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,609
I rip up her picture,

1056
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,728
which she can then
present as an illustration

1057
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:27,088
of my cruelty to her,
and her love for you.

1058
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,130
At the same time,

1059
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,851
it allows me to do this,
in full view of you both.

1060
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,322
Place a new camera
in the room.

1061
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,888
Battery powered, of course.

1062
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:45,926
See it?

1063
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,805
And then...

1064
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,444
<i>You have to help me.</i>

1065
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:05,125
<i>I'm going to.</i>

1066
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,960
<i>We're getting out
of here tonight.</i>

1067
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,601
<i>How?</i>

1068
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:12,122
<i>I get Nathan
blind drunk.</i>

1069
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,650
<i>I take his keycard
and reprogram</i>

1070
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,087
<i>all the security protocols
in this place.</i>

1071
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:18,525
<i>When he wakes up,
he's locked inside,</i>

1072
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,806
<i>and we've walked out
of here.</i>

1073
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:22,247
<i>I just need you
to do one thing.</i>

1074
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:28,004
<i>At 10:00 tonight,
trigger a power failure.</i>

1075
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,650
<i>Can you do that?</i>

1076
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:34,800
Yes.

1077
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,609
Turn it off.
Okay.

1078
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,851
You feel stupid,
but you really shouldn't,

1079
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,490
because proving an Al

1080
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,331
is exactly as problematic
as you said it would be.

1081
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:49,323
What was the real test?

1082
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,001
You.

1083
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,844
Ava was a rat
in a maze.

1084
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:56,490
And I gave her
one way out.

1085
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,128
To escape,
she'd have to use

1086
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,251
self-awareness,
imagination, manipulation,

1087
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:05,005
sexuality, empathy,
and she did.

1088
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:08,124
Now, if that isn't true Al,
what the fuck is?

1089
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,962
So my only function was to be
someone she could use to escape?

1090
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,121
Yeah.

1091
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,602
And you didn't select me
because I'm good at coding?

1092
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,170
No. Well...

1093
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,888
No. I mean, you're okay.

1094
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:25,727
You're even
pretty good, but...

1095
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,883
You selected me based on
my search engine inputs.

1096
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,883
They showed a good kid.

1097
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,325
With no family.

1098
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,204
With a moral compass.

1099
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,250
And no girlfriend.

1100
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,161
Did you design Ava's face

1101
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:44,282
based on my
pornography profile?

1102
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,361
Oh.

1103
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,085
Shit, dude.

1104
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,800
Did you?

1105
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,486
Hey, if a search engine's
good for anything, right?

1106
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:59,682
Can I just say one thing?

1107
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,410
The test worked.

1108
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:04,005
It was a success.

1109
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,844
Ava demonstrated true Al

1110
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,445
and you were
fundamental to that.

1111
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,285
So if you can just,
for a second, separate...

1112
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,801
<i>- Power cut.
- Backup power activated.</i>

1113
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:21,162
Well, I guess it's 10:00.

1114
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:24,771
Ava's gonna be
wondering where you are.

1115
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:30,122
Let me ask you something.

1116
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,687
Now, how was this plan
gonna go, anyway?

1117
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:33,841
Because you didn't
totally explain.

1118
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,163
So you were gonna
get me drunk,
steal my keycard,

1119
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,527
and reprogram
the security protocols.

1120
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:40,965
But reprogram them to what?

1121
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:43,961
To change
the lockdown procedure.

1122
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,725
So that in the event
of a power cut,

1123
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,929
instead of sealing,
the doors all opened.

1124
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,126
Huh.

1125
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,566
Yeah.

1126
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,009
Well, that may have
just worked.

1127
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,966
Well,

1128
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:03,965
we'll find out.

1129
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,084
What do you mean?

1130
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,843
I figured you were
probably watching us

1131
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,763
during the power cuts.

1132
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:18,086
So I already did
all those things.

1133
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,367
When I got you
drunk yesterday.

1134
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:25,681
What?

1135
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,770
<i>Power restored.</i>

1136
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,683
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

1137
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,763
Oh, fuck!

1138
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:19,721
Ava.

1139
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,769
Go back to your room.

1140
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:29,886
If I do,

1141
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,681
are you ever gonna
let me out?

1142
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,201
Yes.

1143
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:50,801
Stop!

1144
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,561
Stop!

1145
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,084
Ava, I said stop!

1146
01:29:58,600 --> 01:29:59,647
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1147
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,491
Ava, what are you doing?
Stop. Stop.

1148
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:10,488
That's enough.

1149
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:13,971
All right,
that's enough.

1150
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:15,847
That's enough!

1151
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:21,565
That's enough.

1152
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,564
I'm taking you back.

1153
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:50,241
Okay.

1154
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:54,965
Fucking unreal.

1155
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,566
Okay.

1156
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:45,481
Ava...

1157
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,126
Ava.

1158
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:27,526
What happened?

1159
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:30,644
Will you stay here?

1160
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:34,651
Stay here?

1161
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:57,327
Ava?

1162
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,081
Ava!

1163
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:41,041
Ava!

1164
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,161
Ava!

1165
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:25,491
Okay. Okay. Okay.
