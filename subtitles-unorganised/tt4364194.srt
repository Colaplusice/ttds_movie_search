00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:54,486
Hi.

3
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,156
Well, hey there, Zak.

4
00:00:56,188 --> 00:00:59,325
- H... H... How are you doing?
- I'm good, thank you.

5
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:01,928
Hmm. I meant the pudding.

6
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,330
Oh, silly me.
Here's your pudding.

7
00:01:04,362 --> 00:01:06,231
Thank you,
and have a nice day.

8
00:01:06,264 --> 00:01:08,067
Well, you do the same, hon.

9
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:36,528
What a great style.
I thought you had...

10
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:37,963
Well, you have that.

11
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:42,135
Oh, my God, if you could get me
a little bit of a refill,

12
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,237
that would make it 110%...

13
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:46,171
You want
a little spice in there?

14
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:47,907
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm.

15
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:51,945
Hey, Zak,
that is so sweet of you

16
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,913
to give Rosemary your pudding.

17
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:56,215
That's why I'm being
a very nice guy.

18
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:03,456
Now.

19
00:02:08,293 --> 00:02:10,495
All right, give me a hand.
I got you.

20
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:16,236
Zak!

21
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:34,280
I don't know.
I'd love to have a nickel

22
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:37,117
for every goddamn time
we've had to watch this tape.

23
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,550
I'd be a rich 'un.

24
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:40,486
<i>Salt Water,
some people claim</i>

25
00:03:40,518 --> 00:03:41,185
<i>the Atomic Throw is impossible.</i>

26
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,389
<i>Those people are wimps.</i>

27
00:03:43,621 --> 00:03:45,257
<i>If you believe in yourself</i>

28
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,928
<i>like the Salt Water Redneck
believes in himself,</i>

29
00:03:48,226 --> 00:03:53,498
<i>you too can learn the moves,
the skills, the Atomic Throw.</i>

30
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:56,736
<i>Some of these moves are</i>

31
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:59,071
<i>outlawed in
international countries...</i>

32
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:03,041
We have watched that throw
10 times today already.

33
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:07,079
I love Salt Water Redneck,
and he is my hero

34
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:10,984
and he is totally...
He is totally a badass.

35
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,519
And he is
the greatest person ever.

36
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:18,291
That's it.
And you will be the next badass.

37
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,162
Zak, both you and Rosemary

38
00:04:24,195 --> 00:04:26,099
have lost your privileges
for the week.

39
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,233
Oh, I really don't care.

40
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:29,334
Oh.

41
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:30,637
I got the solution for that.

42
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:33,373
Move Rosemary in here with him
and I.

43
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,308
I can keep an eye
on both of them.

44
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,476
Huh!

45
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:38,611
That'd be great.
Okay.

46
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:40,480
- I'll set that right up.
- Yeah, sure.

47
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:42,514
Zak, this is not a joke.

48
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,651
That's twice now, two times
that you've tried to run.

49
00:04:45,683 --> 00:04:47,453
And now I have to label you
a flight risk.

50
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:48,988
That sucks.

51
00:04:55,226 --> 00:04:56,628
Is this what you gave
to Rosemary

52
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,663
to convince her
to pretend to be choking?

53
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:00,298
Yes, it is.

54
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:01,735
It's really creative.

55
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,435
Thank you.

56
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:06,204
Not just creative.
It's genius.

57
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:09,075
You know why?
That's an advertisement

58
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:12,045
for what he wants to do
with the rest of his life.

59
00:05:12,077 --> 00:05:14,346
- Carl.
- I don't know her.

60
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,517
I am young, and I am not old.

61
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,156
Carl is old.
And we are different.

62
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:26,191
And I don't know why
I am here.

63
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:28,393
I wish I had a better option
for you, Zak.

64
00:05:28,426 --> 00:05:29,561
But I don't.

65
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,564
You don't have a family

66
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:34,366
that can provide adequate
supervision for you.

67
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:38,370
I know, so, the state
has to put you somewhere,

68
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,740
and this just happens
to be that place.

69
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,175
You been here two years?

70
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:46,146
Two and a half years.

71
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:48,113
We got to fix that.

72
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,316
Just try to be good, okay?

73
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,685
Look at me.
Tell me you'll try.

74
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:56,189
Fine.

75
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:05,697
Tyler.

76
00:06:06,464 --> 00:06:07,566
Hey, Tyler.

77
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:10,570
Yo.

78
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,772
Duncan and Ratboy
are looking for you.

79
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:14,572
And they're going to beat
your ass.

80
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:16,374
They're going to kill you
if you keep shitting

81
00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:17,677
- with their crab pot.
- All right.

82
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:20,113
Turn that damn box off

83
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,481
and listen
to what I'm telling you, boy.

84
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:24,216
You been stealing
their damn crab pots.

85
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:26,553
You know what that's going
to cost me?

86
00:06:26,752 --> 00:06:28,721
It's going to cost me
my damn license

87
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:29,821
for this building here.

88
00:06:29,854 --> 00:06:31,657
What seems to be your problem?

89
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,826
Best thing for you to do
is quit

90
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:35,661
with them damn fish
and leave. Go home.

91
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:38,296
Go, just go.
You done pissed me off now.

92
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:39,264
Let me finish the fish...

93
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,667
Get. Yeah, I know what I said.
Go. Just go.

94
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,368
Let me fix that hoist motor
and I'll leave.

95
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:44,771
The hoist motor's been fixed.

96
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:47,507
I need a job, Winki.

97
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,808
You just go.

98
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:16,135
Hey, man.

99
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:19,439
You can't be bringing me
illegal stuff no more.

100
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:22,407
Duncan's fishing
on Mark's license.

101
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,909
What am I supposed to do?

102
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:26,178
- I would have bought it if...
- Hey, hey, hey.

103
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:29,148
Mark wouldn't want you
to do this.

104
00:07:29,748 --> 00:07:32,452
He's your brother and he's
looking down from above,

105
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:33,819
thinking about you.

106
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:35,587
Thinking about the wrong
you're doing.

107
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:39,358
Get your life together.
Get it in order.

108
00:07:40,925 --> 00:07:43,262
Mark would be proud
of you if you did that.

109
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:46,932
He'd be very proud of you
if you did.

110
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:18,498
Come on.

111
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:22,467
Bedtime, retard.

112
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:38,684
You put this all over
your body. It's soap.

113
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:41,587
It'll make you slippery.
I was an engineer before.

114
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:42,954
I don't know
if I ever told you that.

115
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:44,724
But that's as good
as I could get.

116
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:49,862
Just slip through there,
and off you go on your way.

117
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:50,930
Okay, bud?

118
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,401
Carl, you are my best friend.

119
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:59,038
And y...
And you are my family.

120
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,540
Well, that's it.

121
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,377
Friends are the family
you choose.

122
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,345
And, Carl?

123
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:09,581
You are invited
to my birthday party.

124
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:12,852
Oh, God. Thank you.

125
00:09:13,484 --> 00:09:14,486
I'm there.

126
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,793
Go kick some ass.

127
00:10:56,988 --> 00:10:58,657
You pulled my pots?

128
00:10:59,023 --> 00:11:01,793
Huh? You stealing crab now?

129
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:04,062
I've been laying pots here
for years.

130
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:05,097
Come on, Dunc!

131
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:07,465
Powell's Point was Mark's,
but Mark is gone.

132
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:08,868
Can't lay traps here no more.

133
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,069
Well, I guess taking shit

134
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,605
that don't belong to you,
runs in the family, you know.

135
00:11:12,637 --> 00:11:13,839
You bitch.

136
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:16,943
You got no license now.

137
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,712
You know how things are done
around here, Tyler.

138
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:21,813
There's 10 crabbing licenses
to go around Deer County.

139
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,150
Put them hands on him, Dunc!
Get him!

140
00:11:24,182 --> 00:11:25,784
This one used to belong
to Mark,

141
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,653
but now it says Duncan...

142
00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:31,757
Kick him again, Dunc!

143
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,464
You owe me 20 pots.

144
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,065
Touch my gear again,

145
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:43,636
I shit you not, I'll bash your
skull in with a tire iron.

146
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:45,904
You hear that?

147
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:48,941
You can't fish, and you sure
as shit can't fight.

148
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:50,876
You're still doing accounting.

149
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,439
<i>Zak?</i>

150
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,546
Shit.

151
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:33,618
Carl.

152
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,188
What?

153
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,757
Ex... Explain. What happened?

154
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:42,494
Don't look at me.

155
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,897
You're with the boy every day.
He's incredibly strong.

156
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,902
- E.
- What?

157
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,738
Lee wants to see your ass
in his office right now.

158
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:55,673
We are so screwed.

159
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,745
I'm not done with you.

160
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:02,882
I had nothing to do with it.

161
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:18,690
You're a dead man, Tyler!

162
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:20,993
Go get him.

163
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:33,291
Shh!

164
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:49,441
Who are you?

165
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,310
Zak.

166
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:32,418
Fucking...

167
00:17:34,952 --> 00:17:36,954
Go, go, go, go, go.

168
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:57,276
Yeah.

169
00:17:57,508 --> 00:17:59,878
Oh, hell, yeah.
Continental breakfast.

170
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,416
Mm-hmm.
Listen, I... I got to go.

171
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:06,885
Okay. Bye.

172
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,892
- A flight risk?
- Yes, I...

173
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:15,526
Looks like all that family
money of yours

174
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:16,594
bought you a degree,

175
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,397
but didn't get you
no common sense.

176
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:20,999
- I don't think that...
- Oh, don't speak.

177
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,902
You let a half-naked boy
with Down syndrome

178
00:18:24,936 --> 00:18:27,406
who has no money, no family,

179
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,475
and no idea how to get along
in this world just slip out

180
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:32,545
from under your nose
into thin air.

181
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:35,113
And you have no idea
where he is?

182
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:37,149
Where he's at?
Who he might be with?

183
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:38,549
- Actually, I...
- The nurses tell me

184
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,951
you two are close.

185
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:44,088
We are.

186
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:46,057
Well, then you'll figure out
where he's at

187
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,026
and you'll bring him back

188
00:18:47,058 --> 00:18:49,228
before I have to report this
to the state.

189
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,195
No, Glen,
you have to report this.

190
00:18:51,228 --> 00:18:52,398
He's missing.

191
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,600
Find him.

192
00:19:24,194 --> 00:19:26,130
You know that's just
trespassing, don't you?

193
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:44,950
We have about 30 minutes

194
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:46,918
before this whole shit's
under water.

195
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,644
Oh, excuse me!

196
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:14,313
Will you please help me?

197
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,284
I'm scared. I can't swim.

198
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:33,598
Are you following me?

199
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,536
You ain't got a lick of water
on you, do you?

200
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:45,176
When I can leave you, I will.

201
00:20:56,453 --> 00:20:58,723
I feel great to go to

202
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,661
Salt Water Redneck
Wrestling School.

203
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:06,332
And everybody's going to say,
"Zak is awesome."

204
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:08,300
I'm gonna throw the people
out the ring.

205
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,202
It'll be the Atomic Throw.

206
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,238
And I can fight all my friends.

207
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,340
We'll have a party.
Having a good time.

208
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:17,709
And I feel great.

209
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,351
<i>Come to my wrestling school
in Ayden, North Carolina</i>

210
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:28,586
<i>and become a disciple
of Salt Water Redneck.</i>

211
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,423
<i>You can become
not only a badass,</i>

212
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,258
<i>the badass.</i>

213
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,460
<i>You will learn.</i>

214
00:21:38,496 --> 00:21:39,797
End of the road.

215
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,700
- You know my name?
- No.

216
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:43,134
Good.

217
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,203
- This never happened, okay?
- Okay.

218
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:46,372
Okay.

219
00:21:46,703 --> 00:21:47,705
Hey.

220
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:51,043
Can I come with you?

221
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,812
Why would I need you
to come with me?

222
00:21:53,844 --> 00:21:56,347
Maybe we could be friends...

223
00:21:57,347 --> 00:22:02,153
and buddies, bro dawgs,
and hang and chill.

224
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:03,488
Have a good time.

225
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:08,793
Be good.

226
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:16,301
Hey! Do you want to come
to my birthday party?

227
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,255
Is she a good dog?

228
00:22:36,854 --> 00:22:38,356
Good enough.

229
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:42,493
She don't run away,
so I guess that makes her mine.

230
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:47,533
My wife's long gone.
My kids are grown.

231
00:22:48,565 --> 00:22:50,235
We look out for each other.

232
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,337
That's all right.

233
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:55,574
Crazy, ain't it?

234
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,844
- What's that?
- That fire down at the docks.

235
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,613
- There was a fire at the docks?
- Yeah.

236
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,184
No shit. I didn't hear
nothing about that.

237
00:23:05,482 --> 00:23:07,284
Yeah.
It started out small,

238
00:23:07,317 --> 00:23:09,887
but got out of hand pretty fast.

239
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,623
- Did it?
- Some of them boys

240
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:14,258
are out right now trying to
catch the guy that lit it.

241
00:23:15,626 --> 00:23:17,761
They set up a roadblock
down 158.

242
00:23:17,795 --> 00:23:19,898
- 158, huh?
- Yeah.

243
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,476
Shit, you know what?
I left something back there.

244
00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:32,510
I got to go back.

245
00:23:33,777 --> 00:23:35,212
You sure you don't want
a ride all the way into town?

246
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:36,547
No, I forgot something
back there.

247
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,882
I'm going right there.

248
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:39,684
Oh, I appreciate it,
thank you.

249
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,526
Jump, retard, jump.

250
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,927
No, I'm not gonna do it.

251
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,762
I thought you were
a retard, not a pussy.

252
00:23:51,796 --> 00:23:53,465
- No, I'm not.
- Hey!

253
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:54,632
Come on, jump.

254
00:23:55,732 --> 00:23:56,934
- No.
- Do it!

255
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,202
Hey, he can't swim.

256
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,438
Like I care, dipshit.

257
00:23:59,804 --> 00:24:01,305
Come on, let's go.

258
00:24:01,338 --> 00:24:03,241
- What?
- You heard me.

259
00:24:03,507 --> 00:24:05,442
No. No.

260
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:07,546
- Hey!
- Come on, do it. Jump.

261
00:24:07,578 --> 00:24:09,313
- I am not going to do it.
- Come on, man.

262
00:24:09,346 --> 00:24:10,414
- I said he can't swim.
- Too bad,

263
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,583
- he's gonna do it.
- Hey!

264
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:12,651
Jump, retard.

265
00:24:12,683 --> 00:24:13,818
Didn't I just say...

266
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,271
You said there's wrestling
schools in Ayden?

267
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:33,503
Yes.

268
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:37,241
We're in Manteo.
That's right here.

269
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:42,214
One long road leads all the way
down to Florida.

270
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:45,350
That's where I'm going.
Where you're going is Ayden.

271
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:48,353
That's where the wrestling
school is you're talking about.

272
00:24:48,686 --> 00:24:50,522
You see that? It's on the way.

273
00:24:51,421 --> 00:24:52,824
You bullshitting me
about this wrestling school?

274
00:24:52,856 --> 00:24:53,758
You swear to God?

275
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,263
Yes, I swear to God,
I have proof on the videotape.

276
00:25:00,931 --> 00:25:01,933
All right.

277
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,535
I'll drop you there, then.

278
00:25:04,635 --> 00:25:06,270
I ain't doing no charity shit.
It's just on my way.

279
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,372
Get up.

280
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,845
So, what is your name?

281
00:25:17,414 --> 00:25:18,416
Tyler.

282
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,986
That is a very cool name.

283
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:26,992
Excuse me.

284
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:29,361
Have you seen
this young man anywhere?

285
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,662
Have you seen him anywhere?
His name's Zak.

286
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,966
<i>Sorry to bother you.</i>

287
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,334
I'm just wondering
if you have seen

288
00:25:36,366 --> 00:25:37,635
this young man anywhere.

289
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,771
My name's Eleanor.
I wrote it down right there.

290
00:25:49,046 --> 00:25:50,781
You see a dude
come through here?

291
00:25:51,315 --> 00:25:53,050
About this tall? Beard?

292
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:54,753
A real piece of shit.
You seen him?

293
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,587
Huh? What happened to your face?

294
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:57,689
What happened to your face?

295
00:25:57,721 --> 00:25:59,490
You seen him? Huh?

296
00:25:59,723 --> 00:26:00,758
Where'd he go?

297
00:26:01,758 --> 00:26:02,794
Tell me.

298
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,468
What'd they know?

299
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:11,303
They didn't see shit.

300
00:26:14,104 --> 00:26:15,841
Hey, Tyler.

301
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,942
My feet hurt.

302
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,382
Do you have a car?

303
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:27,786
Tyler?

304
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:31,989
Can we walk on the road?

305
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,428
Uh, excuse me?

306
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:39,964
Will you please answer me?

307
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,500
Let me tell you something.
I'm gonna tell you a story.

308
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:43,601
I'm gonna tell you a story.

309
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:46,103
When I was younger,
my brother and I were camping

310
00:26:46,136 --> 00:26:47,705
at this place
called Caffey's inlet,

311
00:26:47,738 --> 00:26:49,673
and there was a big-ass
hornet's nest down by the water.

312
00:26:49,707 --> 00:26:51,075
So I walked over to them
all excited.

313
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,377
I'm young, I'm into baseball.

314
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,578
And I hit that son of a bitch
like a fucking home run.

315
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,448
And it exploded on me,
and I got stung up real bad.

316
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,115
My face swelled up,
my eyes got real tight,

317
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,883
and I couldn't see shit.
Walked back into camp

318
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:01,886
and my brother Mark said to me,
"You keep stirring up shit,

319
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,555
you're gonna get yourself
killed, boy."

320
00:27:04,654 --> 00:27:07,459
You understand what I'm saying?
You ever kick a hornet's nest?

321
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:08,927
Last night.

322
00:27:11,661 --> 00:27:13,465
You hit a hornet's nest
last night?

323
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:14,498
Last night.

324
00:27:15,632 --> 00:27:17,602
So you understand why we can't
go up on that road then?

325
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:20,939
Stop with this "Tyler" shit.

326
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:22,641
We're gonna be quiet
the rest of the way.

327
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,080
- Tyler.
- Oh, my...

328
00:27:28,578 --> 00:27:29,779
Finish what you got to say.

329
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,150
Finish what you have to say,
and then we'll walk on silent.

330
00:27:32,182 --> 00:27:33,517
We're not gonna do this no more.

331
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,987
"Tyler, Tyler, Tyler, Tyler,"
what?

332
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:40,392
I want you to know
about me.

333
00:27:40,857 --> 00:27:45,062
I am a Down syndrome person.

334
00:27:51,602 --> 00:27:52,903
I don't really give a shit.

335
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,642
Do you got supplies on you?

336
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,678
That's what we need, don't we?

337
00:28:04,114 --> 00:28:05,616
You got supplies?

338
00:28:05,816 --> 00:28:07,584
- No.
- No, you don't.

339
00:28:07,617 --> 00:28:08,853
No, you don't.

340
00:28:09,152 --> 00:28:11,088
No more, "Tyler, Tyler."
No more.

341
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:19,930
Have you got any money?

342
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:24,803
No. No, I have no money,
and I got no pockets.

343
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:31,876
I'm going to give you pockets.

344
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:34,012
There's pockets.

345
00:28:36,546 --> 00:28:38,182
I'm going to go in there
and get essentials.

346
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,751
- Can I come?
- No.

347
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,498
That'll be, uh...

348
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,134
Let me get a sandwich.
Hold on.

349
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:58,103
All right, then.

350
00:28:58,902 --> 00:29:00,104
That'll be...

351
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,842
$13.83.

352
00:29:03,874 --> 00:29:05,142
What?

353
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:09,546
Well, son, that sandwich alone
is four dollars.

354
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,049
Well, forget the sandwich.
How much now?

355
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,985
And your Ding Dongs,
they're two dollars apiece.

356
00:29:14,017 --> 00:29:16,988
- And that's another $1.35.
- All right, how about...

357
00:29:17,688 --> 00:29:19,658
that, just that?

358
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:22,060
Three dollars.
And call it even.

359
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:25,162
- Peanut butter.
- Yeah, all right. That'll work.

360
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,898
Just the peanut butter
and fishhooks.

361
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:30,969
Yes, sir.
Uh, pardon me if I seem alarmed,

362
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:32,970
but I don't normally negotiate
with fellas

363
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,671
if they got shotguns
all over their back.

364
00:29:34,705 --> 00:29:35,874
Oh, shit.

365
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:37,508
I understand.

366
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,911
- Ooh, thank you.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

367
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:41,111
Hey, you got any of the...

368
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:43,715
You got any of them
two-dollar airplane whiskeys

369
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:45,784
- back there?
- No, but...

370
00:29:49,886 --> 00:29:50,954
I got this.

371
00:29:50,988 --> 00:29:52,289
Oh, I can't afford that.

372
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:53,291
It's on me, son.

373
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:56,628
It looks like you might need it
more than I do.

374
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,965
I'm just going to get
a little swig to calm my nerves.

375
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:05,636
Sure. Yeah.
You made it?

376
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,037
I did, sir.

377
00:30:10,874 --> 00:30:12,009
Ooh!

378
00:30:12,242 --> 00:30:14,712
Yeah, you did.

379
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,150
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

380
00:30:19,683 --> 00:30:21,252
Gentlemen.

381
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:29,793
Sorry.

382
00:30:29,826 --> 00:30:31,261
Ma'am, you'll have
to forgive me

383
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:33,631
for staring at you,
but you're one of the prettiest

384
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:35,666
women I've seen in ages.

385
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,136
Where did you blow in here from?

386
00:30:39,603 --> 00:30:41,773
- Richmond. Mm-hmm.
- Richmond? That's nice.

387
00:30:41,805 --> 00:30:45,110
So you, uh...
You graduated JMU, or GW?

388
00:30:45,308 --> 00:30:47,077
- GW.
- Yeah.

389
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,613
Yeah, you got that look
about you.

390
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:50,180
Oh, yeah?
What kind of look is that?

391
00:30:50,213 --> 00:30:53,150
You know, just an "excited
to be alive" kind of look.

392
00:30:53,183 --> 00:30:54,585
What you doing up here?

393
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,588
You're nosy, aren't you?

394
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,889
Yeah, nosy.
That's the word for it.

395
00:30:58,088 --> 00:30:59,823
Nosy. Or interested.

396
00:31:00,056 --> 00:31:01,892
- Interested?
- Yeah. Interested.

397
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:03,061
Are you interested?

398
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,129
No, I'm working.

399
00:31:05,161 --> 00:31:07,065
Working.
What, you working crab boats?

400
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,301
- No.
- I know, that's funny,

401
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:11,835
- because you...
- I know why you think

402
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:13,671
- that's funny.
- Oh, you're trouble. I see.

403
00:31:13,703 --> 00:31:14,738
Okay, you don't like jokes.

404
00:31:15,072 --> 00:31:16,774
I'm looking
for a missing person.

405
00:31:16,806 --> 00:31:18,041
Have either of you gentlemen...

406
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:21,211
I'm assuming I can use
the word "gentlemen."

407
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:22,347
- Have you seen him?
- No.

408
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,815
I ain't... I ain't seen him.

409
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,917
Have you seen him?

410
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,786
Why? What'd he do?

411
00:31:28,818 --> 00:31:30,954
He ran away
from the nursing home I work at.

412
00:31:30,988 --> 00:31:33,924
- Why? Have you seen him?
- So you got some kind of reward?

413
00:31:34,257 --> 00:31:35,092
No.

414
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,295
What are you?
Are you a bounty hunter?

415
00:31:37,694 --> 00:31:39,363
Would I be a bounty hunter
if I just said

416
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:41,098
- there's no bounty?
- No.

417
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:43,034
What are you, his sister?
Minder or something?

418
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:44,635
Not that it's any
of your business,

419
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:47,138
but I care about him,
and he's alone,

420
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,707
- and I want to find him.
- Maybe.

421
00:31:48,972 --> 00:31:50,941
- Maybe? Maybe what?
- Yeah, yeah.

422
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:52,377
Well, maybe he's alone.
Maybe he ain't alone.

423
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,277
You know, you don't know.

424
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:54,446
What if he's living
the American dream

425
00:31:54,478 --> 00:31:58,016
and, you know, he just ran
into a bunch of hitchhikers?

426
00:31:58,048 --> 00:32:00,151
You know, like the Mark Twain
story or something.

427
00:32:00,183 --> 00:32:02,386
- Mm-hmm.
- You like Mark Twain?

428
00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:05,222
- Thank you.
- You like Louis L'Amour?

429
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,325
You got a phone number?

430
00:32:07,357 --> 00:32:09,826
- Yeah, I got a phone number.
- Yeah? You gonna give it to me?

431
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,362
So I find him,
what you want me to do?

432
00:32:11,394 --> 00:32:13,330
- Just holler for you?
- Yeah, just do that.

433
00:32:13,363 --> 00:32:14,766
Yeah? You got a name?

434
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,235
- Yeah, I got a name.
- What is it?

435
00:32:18,035 --> 00:32:19,137
Eleanor.

436
00:32:19,335 --> 00:32:21,139
Eleanor.

437
00:32:24,874 --> 00:32:27,077
All right, partner.

438
00:32:27,978 --> 00:32:29,180
Come back.

439
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,333
You're a goddamn criminal.

440
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:50,235
You're a goddamn criminal,
ain't you?

441
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,737
Fugitive, little man on the lam.

442
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:55,205
Met your girlfriend
back there, Eleanor.

443
00:32:55,238 --> 00:32:57,042
Cute one
from the old folks' home.

444
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:59,243
She likes you quite a bit.
Got a picture of you

445
00:32:59,276 --> 00:33:00,344
and everything,
showing everybody.

446
00:33:00,376 --> 00:33:01,978
That's not a bad thing.

447
00:33:02,011 --> 00:33:03,246
As far as I'm concerned,
it's a good thing.

448
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,882
See, we're going 70 miles
upriver.

449
00:33:04,914 --> 00:33:06,249
We need a tie that binds.

450
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:07,985
And this right here,
you being a wanted man,

451
00:33:08,017 --> 00:33:09,853
this is it,
just the kind of tie we needed.

452
00:33:09,886 --> 00:33:11,354
Hell, yeah.
Two bandits on the run.

453
00:33:11,388 --> 00:33:13,391
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah, partner.

454
00:33:13,423 --> 00:33:14,291
Come on.

455
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,494
Hell, yeah!

456
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:25,236
Listen,
we got new rules now, all right?

457
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,907
We can't keep doing it this way.

458
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,007
New rule is,
you can't slow me down.

459
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,710
You understand? Put those on.

460
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:34,444
So, what I says go.

461
00:33:34,478 --> 00:33:36,013
I say, "jump,"
you say, "how high?"

462
00:33:36,046 --> 00:33:38,216
- How high?
- There it is.

463
00:33:38,481 --> 00:33:40,751
Rule number one:
don't slow me down.

464
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,754
Rule number two: I'm in charge,

465
00:33:42,786 --> 00:33:44,288
and you're going to carry
your own weight.

466
00:33:45,155 --> 00:33:47,157
- You are in charge.
- That's right.

467
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,360
Maybe we should...

468
00:33:49,392 --> 00:33:53,163
Maybe we should have
our own secret handshake.

469
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,200
What kind of secret handshake?
For what?

470
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,803
Buds, dudes, friends.

471
00:33:59,202 --> 00:34:00,504
The buds, dudes,
friends handshake?

472
00:34:00,537 --> 00:34:01,972
All right, here.

473
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:02,873
Let's go, hurry up.

474
00:34:05,976 --> 00:34:08,145
All right, three of those.
Four of those.

475
00:34:09,078 --> 00:34:11,181
One of those.
Now what?

476
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,853
- Like that.
- Yeah.

477
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:18,355
Only when special shit happens,
though, all right?

478
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:20,124
Yeah. Special things.

479
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,993
Special things. You don't curse.

480
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,426
- No.
- Why don't you curse?

481
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,463
- Because I don't.
- Okay, come on.

482
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,399
- You are in charge.
- Exactly.

483
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,168
Come on.

484
00:34:36,172 --> 00:34:37,776
Hey, what's rule number one?

485
00:34:40,243 --> 00:34:41,845
What's rule number one?

486
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,415
- Party?
- No, not party.

487
00:34:44,448 --> 00:34:46,183
No, it's not party.
Don't slow me down.

488
00:34:46,216 --> 00:34:48,152
That's rule number one.
Let's go, come on.

489
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:50,421
Come on, pick it up.

490
00:34:50,453 --> 00:34:52,156
There you go.
You got boots on now.

491
00:34:52,189 --> 00:34:55,058
Rule number one is not "party."
What is rule number one?

492
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,960
"Don't slow me down."

493
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,863
- Rule number one?
- You are in charge.

494
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:01,465
All right, all right.
We're gonna figure it out.

495
00:35:33,897 --> 00:35:37,901
It is too...
Too far from the other side.

496
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:40,137
Yeah, well,
we ain't got many options.

497
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,406
I'm not walking through
two days of brier bushes,

498
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:44,507
and we can't go back
the way we came.

499
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,044
So we're going swimming.
You got a better idea?

500
00:35:47,277 --> 00:35:50,013
We could get a plane.

501
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,983
Take your pants off.

502
00:35:53,549 --> 00:35:55,486
- I can't swim.
- Yeah, I know you can't swim.

503
00:35:55,518 --> 00:35:56,921
But you can float.

504
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:03,627
Zak, I need you to listen to me.

505
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:06,063
That bag and them pants
are gonna hold air.

506
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:07,665
They're going to float you.
Do not let go.

507
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,433
You hold on
with everything you got,

508
00:36:09,466 --> 00:36:11,168
because I sure as shit
don't want to have

509
00:36:11,201 --> 00:36:12,969
to go swimming over there,
thinking about you sinking us.

510
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:14,939
And I don't want to dredge
the bottom for your body.

511
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:16,006
You understand?

512
00:36:16,205 --> 00:36:17,341
Tyler...

513
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,445
am I going to die?

514
00:36:20,643 --> 00:36:22,446
Yeah, you're going to die.
It's a matter of time.

515
00:36:22,478 --> 00:36:23,681
That ain't the question.
The question is,

516
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:25,216
whether they're going to have
a good story

517
00:36:25,248 --> 00:36:26,283
to tell about you
when you're gone.

518
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:27,518
Now, don't be a bitch.
Let's go.

519
00:36:28,118 --> 00:36:29,487
Don't cry, Zak.

520
00:36:41,397 --> 00:36:42,633
Hold on, Zak!

521
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:50,040
Kick, Zak!

522
00:36:52,475 --> 00:36:54,011
Kick, Zak!

523
00:36:58,381 --> 00:36:59,650
Kick, Zak!

524
00:37:03,286 --> 00:37:05,055
Please get me
out of here!

525
00:37:07,991 --> 00:37:09,160
Fuck!

526
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:41,491
That is the greatest story
to tell.

527
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:47,265
Oh, come on.

528
00:39:19,723 --> 00:39:21,826
I ain't the slightest bit
scared of you.

529
00:39:22,558 --> 00:39:27,598
I... I wanna be
professional wrestler.

530
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:30,167
And I am a bad guy.

531
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:33,336
Why do you want to be
the bad guy?

532
00:39:34,404 --> 00:39:35,406
Because...

533
00:39:36,772 --> 00:39:39,544
my family left me.

534
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,583
That don't make you a bad guy.

535
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:49,252
Good guys get left too, Zak.

536
00:39:51,888 --> 00:39:55,558
Ain't about no silly laugh,
or wearing black,

537
00:39:55,591 --> 00:39:59,162
and eye shadow and shit.
Ain't nothing to do with that.

538
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:00,663
It has to do
with what's in here,

539
00:40:00,696 --> 00:40:03,200
in your heart.
You got a good-guy heart.

540
00:40:03,232 --> 00:40:05,401
You can't do shit about it.
That's just who you are.

541
00:40:05,435 --> 00:40:06,536
You're a hero.

542
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:10,707
I can't be a hero, because...

543
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:15,713
I am a Down... syndrome.

544
00:40:16,946 --> 00:40:18,582
What's that got to do
with your heart?

545
00:40:19,348 --> 00:40:20,617
Who told you that?

546
00:40:21,518 --> 00:40:23,821
- Coach, teachers.
- Your coach?

547
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:25,355
What'd your coach say?

548
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:29,326
I am retarded.

549
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,496
Your coach said that?

550
00:40:33,363 --> 00:40:36,267
What a shitty coach.
Your team ever win anything?

551
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,703
No?

552
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:43,908
Some shit
you ain't never gonna do.

553
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,776
That's all right.

554
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:47,844
You can't be everything.

555
00:40:47,877 --> 00:40:48,879
You ain't gonna be no...

556
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,782
No professional
basketball player.

557
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,485
You ain't gonna dunk
no basketball,

558
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,254
or be an Olympic swimmer.

559
00:40:57,286 --> 00:41:00,357
You sink like a stone,
because you're all muscle.

560
00:41:01,524 --> 00:41:02,660
Muscle sinks.

561
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,763
Today, you pulled me up
out of that water,

562
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,730
you almost pulled my whole arm
out the socket.

563
00:41:07,763 --> 00:41:09,866
Most grown folk I know
ain't got that kind of strength.

564
00:41:10,533 --> 00:41:11,935
You're strong, Zak.

565
00:41:14,571 --> 00:41:15,873
Fuck your coach.

566
00:41:18,808 --> 00:41:20,511
- Tyler.
- Yeah?

567
00:41:23,513 --> 00:41:27,951
- Who those people on the boat?
- On the boat?

568
00:41:28,384 --> 00:41:29,921
That's Duncan and Ratboy.

569
00:41:31,687 --> 00:41:35,358
They are a good guy
or a bad guy?

570
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:36,393
Bad guy.

571
00:41:38,527 --> 00:41:39,964
- Tyler?
- Hmm?

572
00:41:40,596 --> 00:41:44,569
Are you the good guy
or a bad guy?

573
00:41:45,935 --> 00:41:47,270
I don't know.

574
00:41:47,937 --> 00:41:49,239
What you think?

575
00:41:51,507 --> 00:41:53,276
You are a good guy.

576
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,328
What?

577
00:42:47,497 --> 00:42:48,832
Will you please train me?

578
00:42:49,866 --> 00:42:52,370
Yeah, I don't know shit
about wrestling.

579
00:42:54,103 --> 00:42:55,739
I want to learn.

580
00:42:57,107 --> 00:43:00,878
I want to be a hero.

581
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,524
You know how to do push-ups?

582
00:43:15,024 --> 00:43:16,026
Yeah?

583
00:43:18,428 --> 00:43:19,430
Let's go.

584
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,866
Oh, what do you want to do?

585
00:43:22,565 --> 00:43:24,834
We're going to go train.
Yeah.

586
00:43:26,669 --> 00:43:27,738
It's balance.

587
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,442
This'll kick your ass,
you understand?

588
00:43:34,877 --> 00:43:38,015
Always keep your hand like that
so you don't fire.

589
00:43:38,714 --> 00:43:40,483
Hey, so,
what's the deal with Eleanor?

590
00:43:40,716 --> 00:43:42,452
- She's your friend?
- Yeah.

591
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:44,922
- She's a nice woman?
- Mm-hmm.

592
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:46,490
What's she like?

593
00:43:46,823 --> 00:43:49,893
She, uh...
She is my friend.

594
00:43:49,926 --> 00:43:53,364
And she has been looking out
for me.

595
00:43:53,696 --> 00:43:55,399
- She's your friend?
- Yeah.

596
00:43:55,765 --> 00:43:56,767
Cheers.

597
00:43:58,801 --> 00:44:00,671
Push, push, push.
There it is, there it is!

598
00:44:00,703 --> 00:44:01,805
There it is! Push!

599
00:44:01,837 --> 00:44:03,740
All right, point and fire.
Come on.

600
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,078
You all right?

601
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:10,047
Hey, you all right, boy?

602
00:44:15,951 --> 00:44:18,622
Get it! Get it! Get it!

603
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,998
Push, push,
push, push, push.

604
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,669
Grab my head.
Grab my head.

605
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,674
That bead and that bead
need to be lined up.

606
00:44:38,707 --> 00:44:40,610
- Okay, I got it.
- Little wider with your stance

607
00:44:40,643 --> 00:44:41,812
- inside here.
- It is.

608
00:44:41,844 --> 00:44:45,750
All right, all right,
bring it, three, two, one.

609
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:49,018
- And I got them all.
- That's the buck shot.

610
00:44:52,855 --> 00:44:53,857
Bam.

611
00:45:16,745 --> 00:45:19,182
We got to find a way
to move faster, all right?

612
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:30,593
Yeah.

613
00:45:31,194 --> 00:45:33,096
- Hey, this can work.
- Oh, yeah.

614
00:45:33,129 --> 00:45:34,832
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

615
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,169
You all right?

616
00:45:42,205 --> 00:45:43,741
Freeze, you son of bitches!

617
00:45:47,676 --> 00:45:49,812
You son of a bitches
think you can come over here

618
00:45:49,846 --> 00:45:52,183
and rob Jasper
just 'cause he's blind?

619
00:45:52,781 --> 00:45:55,051
Well, you'd better think again,
goddamn it.

620
00:45:56,886 --> 00:45:59,055
Y'all boys black or white?

621
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:04,594
Okay.

622
00:46:05,761 --> 00:46:06,830
White!

623
00:46:06,863 --> 00:46:07,864
White!

624
00:46:08,998 --> 00:46:11,968
I knowed you was white.
I could smell you a mile off.

625
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,504
Is you God-fearing?

626
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:14,872
Yup.

627
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:18,642
Well, good.

628
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,820
There's sheep in this world,

629
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:32,022
and there are wolves
in this world.

630
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:36,794
I may not have my eyes,
but I know the difference.

631
00:46:37,326 --> 00:46:42,031
And I know that you two boys
are just two fleece-wearing

632
00:46:42,064 --> 00:46:44,901
weary travelers
who lost your way.

633
00:46:45,234 --> 00:46:47,537
Neither one of you are wolves.

634
00:46:47,736 --> 00:46:51,107
You're just sheep
that strayed from his flock.

635
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:55,212
I'm donating the supplies
from my junkyard

636
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:57,114
for your pilgrimage.

637
00:46:58,614 --> 00:47:00,883
Anything but that tin boat,

638
00:47:00,917 --> 00:47:03,620
y'all can have it,
because I figure it's my duty

639
00:47:03,652 --> 00:47:05,189
to get you back
to your shepherd.

640
00:47:07,924 --> 00:47:10,893
Now, I can't have you boys
running off of here

641
00:47:10,926 --> 00:47:12,863
with your hands all dirty
and everything,

642
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,332
because a wolf
might hunt you down

643
00:47:15,364 --> 00:47:18,134
just by the smell
of your past sins.

644
00:47:19,134 --> 00:47:21,571
<i>And I wouldn't want no wolf
to get ahold of you,</i>

645
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:24,041
<i>because that'd be a frightful,
bloody mess.</i>

646
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:27,011
So we gonna
clean you up right...

647
00:47:28,377 --> 00:47:29,913
with a baptism.

648
00:47:30,879 --> 00:47:32,248
What's a baptism?

649
00:47:32,281 --> 00:47:33,950
It's like swimming.

650
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,286
Y'all boys come on down here

651
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:39,290
and bathe in the warm waters
of forgiveness.

652
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:42,658
I'm more a "baptism-by-fire"
type.

653
00:47:42,692 --> 00:47:44,728
Well, unfortunately,
I don't perform

654
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:46,797
those kind of baptisms.

655
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,029
<i>Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.</i>

656
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:24,802
<i>Nothing can touch you now,
under the grace of the Lord.</i>

657
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,269
Bye, Jasper.

658
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:27,805
Stay cool.

659
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:29,373
Take care.

660
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,808
<i>Accept his blessing.</i>

661
00:48:33,442 --> 00:48:37,948
<i>Let all the wolves of your past
be laid to rest.</i>

662
00:48:45,888 --> 00:48:48,224
Tyler, I...

663
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:52,096
am going to give you
all of my wishes

664
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,198
for my birthday.

665
00:49:22,424 --> 00:49:24,961
Thank you.

666
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,166
You're welcome.

667
00:50:05,234 --> 00:50:06,937
Hi, sir.
Sorry to bother you.

668
00:50:06,969 --> 00:50:08,906
I'm wondering
if you've seen this young man.

669
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:11,841
I ain't seen shit, girl.

670
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,879
I... I apologize.

671
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:18,982
Um, maybe have you...
Have you heard him?

672
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:21,017
- Have you heard his voice?
- You God-fearing?

673
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,522
- Sometimes.
- Well, good.

674
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:29,760
You come on in here
and let's talk about Jesus.

675
00:50:56,152 --> 00:50:57,821
When you get off,
go towards the shore.

676
00:50:58,154 --> 00:50:59,356
There's drag marks.

677
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,290
What happened?

678
00:51:02,024 --> 00:51:04,260
- My ankle hurts.
- Your ankle hurts?

679
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:05,328
- Yeah.
- All right,

680
00:51:05,361 --> 00:51:06,363
we'll fix it right now.

681
00:51:07,196 --> 00:51:09,198
Drink that.
Make you feel better.

682
00:51:16,605 --> 00:51:18,841
All right,
rule number one is what?

683
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:20,243
- Party.
- Party.

684
00:51:20,276 --> 00:51:22,980
- All right! Ha!
- Yeah!

685
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,782
Yeah!

686
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:28,986
14, 15, 16,

687
00:51:29,285 --> 00:51:32,087
17, 18, 19...

688
00:51:33,422 --> 00:51:35,926
I cannot feel my...

689
00:51:36,225 --> 00:51:37,326
My hands.

690
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,863
I cannot feel my hands,

691
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:43,433
and I cannot feel my ankle.

692
00:51:43,466 --> 00:51:46,236
You can't feel shit.
You can't feel shit.

693
00:51:46,268 --> 00:51:48,337
Don't step on me now.
Don't step on me.

694
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,940
- Oh, excuse me, Tyler...
- You can't feel shit.

695
00:51:52,174 --> 00:51:54,277
- What?
- I got to get my log.

696
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,286
Hey.

697
00:52:04,953 --> 00:52:07,423
- I'm not strong enough.
- Who's strong enough?

698
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:09,860
Who's strong enough?

699
00:52:15,064 --> 00:52:17,299
Hey, you know what you need?
You need to change your...

700
00:52:17,332 --> 00:52:18,901
You need to change your name.

701
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:21,872
You need to get a...
An alternate ego.

702
00:52:21,904 --> 00:52:23,239
You know what I'm saying?

703
00:52:23,272 --> 00:52:25,209
Like in
the Wrestling Federation.

704
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,410
Wrestlers got alter egos.

705
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:30,047
What's your favorite
wrestler's name?

706
00:52:30,346 --> 00:52:31,948
The Salt Water Redneck.

707
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,250
The Salt Water Redneck
ain't born with that name.

708
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:36,920
You need a name.

709
00:52:37,986 --> 00:52:38,988
What's your name?

710
00:52:41,623 --> 00:52:42,859
Falcon.

711
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,263
Falcon.
Falcon.

712
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,466
Ooh, Falcon.

713
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,102
Falcon, that's a good name.

714
00:52:52,134 --> 00:52:54,303
Hold on, ooh, I got an idea.

715
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,605
Hold on right there.
Wait right there.

716
00:52:56,638 --> 00:52:58,341
You got to make a uniform.

717
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:01,310
Falcon uniform!
Hell, yeah!

718
00:53:01,343 --> 00:53:02,445
Falcon.

719
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:04,414
Hey!

720
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,017
Did I tell you could have
some of that peanut butter?

721
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:08,584
- Yeah.
- It ain't snack time,

722
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:10,320
it's jack time.
Here we go.

723
00:53:12,187 --> 00:53:13,923
Woo-hoo!

724
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:15,525
We need war paint.

725
00:53:15,991 --> 00:53:17,160
Yeah.

726
00:53:17,192 --> 00:53:18,995
I need peanut butter.

727
00:53:20,228 --> 00:53:22,031
You want to be slick.

728
00:53:22,064 --> 00:53:24,033
The Peanut Butter Falcon!

729
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:27,004
Get it up!
Pick that sucker up!

730
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:30,040
You got all the power,
power of Zeus.

731
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:31,575
Push it! Push it! Push!

732
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:38,482
You got it!
You got it!

733
00:53:38,681 --> 00:53:41,118
Peanut Butter Falcon!

734
00:53:43,518 --> 00:53:44,620
You got it!

735
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:12,049
Falcon! Falcon! Falcon! Falcon!

736
00:54:13,716 --> 00:54:16,219
I'm the Peanut Butter Falcon!

737
00:54:41,743 --> 00:54:42,745
Zak.

738
00:54:45,314 --> 00:54:46,315
Zak.

739
00:54:47,716 --> 00:54:49,184
Zak.

740
00:54:49,218 --> 00:54:50,319
Oh, my God.

741
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:52,288
Zak, are you okay?

742
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:54,591
- Oh, my God.
- Hello!

743
00:54:56,792 --> 00:54:57,995
Hey!

744
00:55:00,462 --> 00:55:02,131
- Come on, sit up.
- You found us.

745
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:04,067
That's them pheromones.
Like a bear.

746
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,634
What is this?
What's on your face?

747
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:07,336
- Yeah!
- I thought you said

748
00:55:07,536 --> 00:55:09,638
- you hadn't seen him.
- He's right there.

749
00:55:10,339 --> 00:55:11,408
There he is.

750
00:55:12,274 --> 00:55:13,709
Come on, buddy. Let's go.

751
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:15,378
- Come on. Thank you.
- No, you're good.

752
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:17,613
You're good right there.
Sit right there, he's all right.

753
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,449
Okay, I don't know
what's going on, but...

754
00:55:19,815 --> 00:55:21,718
Put that on, Zak.
Here, brother.

755
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:23,152
I've got it, thank you.

756
00:55:23,185 --> 00:55:24,254
He could do it.

757
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:26,523
He could put his own shirt on.
He's 22-years-old.

758
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:27,791
Okay, thank you, I've got it.

759
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:30,227
- We're good now.
- Huh.

760
00:55:32,194 --> 00:55:33,629
You ready? You good to go?
You okay?

761
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,465
- Ah, my ankle.
- What? What...

762
00:55:35,497 --> 00:55:36,698
- He's fine.
- What happened to his ankle?

763
00:55:36,732 --> 00:55:37,701
He's showing off
because you're here.

764
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:39,868
- What's wrong with his ankle?
- Nothing's wrong with his ankle.

765
00:55:39,902 --> 00:55:40,803
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

766
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,739
- Who are you, even?
- Who are you, even?

767
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:45,808
You have a young boy
with Down syndrome

768
00:55:45,841 --> 00:55:47,410
in the middle of nowhere.

769
00:55:47,442 --> 00:55:49,211
I'm the one
who's been taking care of him,

770
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:51,348
because you can't do it
unless you put him in a cage.

771
00:55:51,647 --> 00:55:53,183
Okay, um...

772
00:55:53,716 --> 00:55:56,319
look, he needs to be
properly taken care of,

773
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:57,721
and that's my job.

774
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,089
I'm sorry to break up
your little primitive gang,

775
00:56:00,122 --> 00:56:01,590
or whatever's going on...

776
00:56:01,623 --> 00:56:02,692
...but this is not
<i>Lord of the Flies.</i>

777
00:56:02,725 --> 00:56:05,127
You can't just... There's rules,
there's regulations.

778
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,328
- Okay.
- He has medication,

779
00:56:06,361 --> 00:56:07,529
- there's paperwork.
- Yeah, all right.

780
00:56:07,562 --> 00:56:08,463
Well, while you've been
doing paperwork,

781
00:56:08,497 --> 00:56:09,799
we've been doing something
called living,

782
00:56:10,198 --> 00:56:11,434
- ain't that right, brother?
- Yeah.

783
00:56:12,768 --> 00:56:13,770
Okay.

784
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:15,672
Cool.

785
00:56:17,806 --> 00:56:19,274
But we're going to go.

786
00:56:19,308 --> 00:56:20,543
- So, thank you.
- No, we're not.

787
00:56:20,576 --> 00:56:21,511
He's fine where he is.

788
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:24,480
May I please speak
to you in private?

789
00:56:24,513 --> 00:56:26,515
Oh. Oh, like a private party?
Yeah, all right.

790
00:56:27,149 --> 00:56:28,884
- One second, Zak.
- I got water, you want water?

791
00:56:28,917 --> 00:56:30,286
Right now.

792
00:56:30,486 --> 00:56:32,254
Primitive gang.
Hell, yeah.

793
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:34,257
I like when you put
your hair up like that.

794
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:36,526
It's nice. Some water?

795
00:56:38,727 --> 00:56:41,363
Look, I could have you arrested
for kidnapping, okay?

796
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,165
Oh, you're going to have me
arrested for kidnapping?

797
00:56:43,198 --> 00:56:44,133
How do you figure?

798
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,535
You can't have me arrested.
He's a runaway.

799
00:56:45,734 --> 00:56:46,835
Can't kidnap a runaway.
Come on, genius.

800
00:56:46,868 --> 00:56:48,370
You said GW, didn't you?

801
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:50,406
I'm sure I could find
some reason to arrest you.

802
00:56:50,439 --> 00:56:52,209
Hey, let me ask you,
what do you want for him?

803
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:55,344
I'm not going to sell him
to you.

804
00:56:55,377 --> 00:56:58,314
No, no, what do you want
for his life? His future?

805
00:57:00,783 --> 00:57:01,785
Why are you... You don't know

806
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:03,820
- anything about him.
- You know about the wrestling?

807
00:57:03,852 --> 00:57:04,921
Yes, of course I know
about the wrestling.

808
00:57:04,953 --> 00:57:06,489
All right, so I know something
about him, don't I?

809
00:57:07,723 --> 00:57:09,625
So, uh, you're a little late
to the party.

810
00:57:09,658 --> 00:57:11,427
This is what's going on.
I made a promise to him,

811
00:57:11,627 --> 00:57:13,263
to get him to that wrestling
school in Ayden.

812
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:14,464
- Oh.
- You understand?

813
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:16,466
I gave him my word, and I ain't
gonna back down on my word.

814
00:57:16,498 --> 00:57:17,767
Now, you seem like
a nice person.

815
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:19,935
You care for him and all.
You came all the way out here.

816
00:57:19,968 --> 00:57:20,668
Maybe it's because you like me.
I don't know.

817
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:23,473
And, uh,
I'mma offer you a favor.

818
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:24,440
You can get on that raft with us

819
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:25,842
and you can ride down there
if you want.

820
00:57:26,942 --> 00:57:29,879
N... No, we're not going to hop
on your little raft

821
00:57:29,911 --> 00:57:32,415
- and cruise around the river.
- It's hot, you're confused.

822
00:57:32,448 --> 00:57:35,185
- I'm not asking you.
- Hey, Eleanor!

823
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:39,421
Oh! Ooh! Oh.

824
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:40,623
Oh!

825
00:57:40,855 --> 00:57:43,560
I want to see...

826
00:57:45,393 --> 00:57:47,330
Salt Water Redneck.

827
00:57:47,763 --> 00:57:49,966
And I don't want to go home.

828
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:16,560
So how far is it on, um...
On the raft?

829
00:58:18,393 --> 00:58:19,828
About that far on a map.

830
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,935
- Are your fingers to scale?
- Yeah.

831
00:58:25,734 --> 00:58:28,270
So how much time is that much?

832
00:58:28,303 --> 00:58:29,939
That's different
than what I put up.

833
00:58:29,971 --> 00:58:31,874
- All right.
- What I did is about a day.

834
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:33,777
Maybe two days.

835
00:58:35,777 --> 00:58:36,913
- Days? Like...
- Yeah.

836
00:58:37,379 --> 00:58:39,848
Okay.

837
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,289
Are you kidding?

838
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:49,926
What in the Christ...

839
00:58:50,926 --> 00:58:52,728
Hey, Zak,
why don't you sit down, bud.

840
00:58:52,761 --> 00:58:54,330
You're kind of close
to the edge.

841
00:58:54,363 --> 00:58:55,665
I don't want you to fall in.

842
00:58:57,632 --> 00:58:59,535
Hey, are you hungry?
Have you eaten anything?

843
00:58:59,868 --> 00:59:01,770
I am not really hungry.

844
00:59:01,803 --> 00:59:03,772
Well, maybe you should
just have a bite of something

845
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:04,640
for your blood sugar.

846
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,309
He don't want
nothing to eat.

847
00:59:06,341 --> 00:59:08,310
You know how you get, buddy.
I have an apple.

848
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:10,247
- Hey.
- I have some M&M's.

849
00:59:10,645 --> 00:59:12,348
- What?
- Don't do that.

850
00:59:12,381 --> 00:59:13,549
Don't do what?

851
00:59:19,922 --> 00:59:21,891
Hey, I got an idea, why don't
we keep our training going.

852
00:59:21,924 --> 00:59:23,359
Just because we're on a raft
don't mean

853
00:59:23,392 --> 00:59:24,460
we gonna stop training, does it?

854
00:59:25,694 --> 00:59:26,528
All right, so we're going to do
breathing control exercises.

855
00:59:26,562 --> 00:59:27,529
She's worried
about your blood sugar.

856
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,899
We're going to breathe.
Take a deep breath in.

857
00:59:31,433 --> 00:59:32,835
Out.

858
00:59:33,502 --> 00:59:34,570
All right, cool,
now, come over here

859
00:59:34,602 --> 00:59:36,272
and put your head underwater.
I'm gonna time you.

860
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:38,841
What? No, no, no.
He can't do that. Zak...

861
00:59:38,873 --> 00:59:41,044
No, he can do that.
He can do that. He can...

862
00:59:43,511 --> 00:59:44,680
There you go.

863
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:46,382
You'd better stop calling him
a retard.

864
00:59:46,415 --> 00:59:49,085
I have never called anyone a...
That word.

865
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:49,951
Okay. Hold on, listen,

866
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:51,488
when people are saying
he's a retard,

867
00:59:52,754 --> 00:59:53,355
really what they're saying is he
can't do some shit they can do.

868
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:55,424
See, you might not be saying
the word "retard",

869
00:59:55,457 --> 00:59:56,091
all right, I'll give you that,
but you damn sure

870
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:57,794
is making him feel retarded.

871
00:59:57,826 --> 00:59:59,094
That ain't going to help
his life.

872
00:59:59,127 --> 01:00:01,096
- Hey, there we go.
- Time.

873
01:00:01,129 --> 01:00:02,431
- How long is that?
- Long.

874
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,467
Not long enough, Zak.
Do it again.

875
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:05,801
Okay.

876
01:00:09,538 --> 01:00:12,409
You have got some real nerve
talking to me like that.

877
01:00:12,774 --> 01:00:14,310
Do you even know what I do?

878
01:00:14,643 --> 01:00:17,513
I've spent the last two years
of my life volunteering

879
01:00:17,546 --> 01:00:20,317
to hold people's hands
as they pass away.

880
01:00:20,616 --> 01:00:22,884
I talk to them, I feed them,
I wipe their asses,

881
01:00:22,917 --> 01:00:24,988
I change their clothes,
I put them to bed.

882
01:00:25,721 --> 01:00:27,457
And I'm the last person
they see.

883
01:00:28,056 --> 01:00:30,026
Don't act like you know
jack shit about me.

884
01:00:30,058 --> 01:00:31,593
- All right.
- Yeah,

885
01:00:31,627 --> 01:00:33,429
maybe he should not be
in a retirement home,

886
01:00:33,462 --> 01:00:34,864
but I didn't choose that
for him.

887
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:36,699
But that's what happened,
and now I am doing

888
01:00:36,732 --> 01:00:38,835
the best I can.

889
01:00:39,067 --> 01:00:40,703
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh!

890
01:00:40,736 --> 01:00:42,906
Hey! Oh, shit!

891
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:45,040
God! Zak! Okay.

892
01:00:45,473 --> 01:00:46,642
Yeah. Lunch!

893
01:00:46,674 --> 01:00:49,077
Zak, did you just
catch that with your hands?

894
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,515
How'd you do that?
You're a wild man.

895
01:00:54,049 --> 01:00:55,384
Oh, my God.

896
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,616
<i>We got three options
for lunch today.</i>

897
01:01:26,815 --> 01:01:28,451
We can boil water
from the sound,

898
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:29,652
make a little chowder.

899
01:01:30,018 --> 01:01:31,154
- Huh?
- Uh-uh.

900
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,822
- Plain fish?
- Uh-uh.

901
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,690
Fish with peanut butter?

902
01:01:34,723 --> 01:01:36,625
- Fish with peanut butter.
- Hey!

903
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,460
You got to give him
what he wants then.

904
01:01:38,493 --> 01:01:39,828
Here, go ahead.
Load up.

905
01:01:40,796 --> 01:01:41,998
Oh, just right on there.

906
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,666
- There you go.
- That's... Yeah.

907
01:01:44,165 --> 01:01:45,968
You want a big piece
or small piece?

908
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,036
- That's good, that's great.
- If you fold it,

909
01:01:48,069 --> 01:01:50,640
- you can make a little taco.
- Okay, that's nice.

910
01:01:50,672 --> 01:01:53,075
Yeah.
That's a good bite.

911
01:01:56,712 --> 01:01:57,614
That's good, huh?

912
01:01:59,247 --> 01:02:00,182
Five stars.

913
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,051
You hear that?

914
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:06,456
Bang.

915
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:09,091
- Boom!
- What is that?

916
01:02:09,692 --> 01:02:11,161
That is...

917
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:14,897
our... Our special handshake.

918
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:18,167
- Yeah.
- That is our special thing.

919
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,569
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

920
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:21,237
I want to have
a special handshake.

921
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,505
It's only for special shit.

922
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:24,640
Like what kind of special shit?

923
01:02:25,674 --> 01:02:27,009
I don't know. Go ahead.

924
01:02:27,042 --> 01:02:28,645
No, you tell her.

925
01:02:28,843 --> 01:02:30,046
You brought it up.

926
01:02:30,245 --> 01:02:31,814
Um, hmm...

927
01:02:31,846 --> 01:02:33,149
Tell her about the boat.

928
01:02:33,181 --> 01:02:34,216
Oh, um...

929
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:37,019
we did... Hit by the boat.

930
01:02:37,051 --> 01:02:38,954
- Almost.
- You got hit by a boat?

931
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:40,723
- Almost.
- What happened?

932
01:02:40,756 --> 01:02:42,491
We almost got run over
by a shrimp boat.

933
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:43,993
- What?
- Yeah.

934
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,830
And we did have the, um...

935
01:02:47,596 --> 01:02:49,265
- shotgun.
- Shotgun, buckshot.

936
01:02:49,297 --> 01:02:50,700
He fired a shotgun.

937
01:02:50,732 --> 01:02:51,933
And we got shot at, remember?

938
01:02:51,966 --> 01:02:53,535
Oh, yeah, I did remember.

939
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:19,695
Eleanor, this is so easy.

940
01:03:19,727 --> 01:03:20,762
Easy.

941
01:03:20,796 --> 01:03:21,998
Um, hold on

942
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:24,799
- and let go.
- Let go, that's it.

943
01:03:24,832 --> 01:03:26,001
- Let go.
- Let go.

944
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:27,103
Ready? Three...

945
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,605
- No, no, no, don't rush me.
- ...two, one.

946
01:03:29,638 --> 01:03:30,906
Get it! Get it! Get it!

947
01:03:37,312 --> 01:03:38,714
Come here!

948
01:03:40,015 --> 01:03:41,084
Zak.

949
01:04:01,303 --> 01:04:03,839
I love my family,
and I hope

950
01:04:04,038 --> 01:04:06,241
that we will share it forever,

951
01:04:06,274 --> 01:04:08,843
for the rest of our life.

952
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:11,581
Yes!

953
01:04:19,888 --> 01:04:23,192
If you were the prince
in a royal family,

954
01:04:23,225 --> 01:04:24,794
what would your name be?

955
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:27,864
Uh, Zak Prince.

956
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:30,933
That's really good.

957
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,442
Hold up, Tyler.

958
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:48,143
Hey, hey!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

959
01:05:48,176 --> 01:05:50,680
Get on your knees.
Get on your knees.

960
01:05:50,712 --> 01:05:52,015
Over there. Right here. Okay.

961
01:05:59,187 --> 01:06:02,157
That's $12,000 worth of gear
you burnt up.

962
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:03,326
That's my season.

963
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:05,795
What's to stop other people
from messing with us

964
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:06,763
now that you have?

965
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,830
I won't ever mention
no harm done.

966
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:10,433
Even so, I got to make it right.

967
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,401
Not just for me,
but for all of us.

968
01:06:12,433 --> 01:06:13,334
For our livelihood.

969
01:06:13,368 --> 01:06:14,736
You ain't
gotta shoot me, though.

970
01:06:16,004 --> 01:06:17,072
I'm going to get you your money,
I promise you. I promise you.

971
01:06:17,105 --> 01:06:17,772
- Shut the hell up, man.
- Shut up. Shut up.

972
01:06:17,806 --> 01:06:19,175
Right hand or left hand, Tyler?

973
01:06:20,308 --> 01:06:21,243
I'm gonna make it right,
I'm gonna get you your money.

974
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:22,211
No, Tyler.
Right hand or left hand?

975
01:06:22,243 --> 01:06:23,344
I'm giving you a choice.
You better hurry up.

976
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:26,214
- Screw this. Right hand.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

977
01:06:26,247 --> 01:06:27,849
Whoa!

978
01:06:28,917 --> 01:06:29,919
Zak.

979
01:06:30,285 --> 01:06:31,286
Stay there.

980
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:38,460
You could pull the trigger.

981
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:40,962
Can you aim that thing?

982
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:43,799
It's a buckshot.

983
01:06:43,832 --> 01:06:45,267
Get back in your boat,
and you're gonna leave.

984
01:06:45,299 --> 01:06:47,002
We ain't never gonna see
each other again.

985
01:06:47,035 --> 01:06:48,071
Or he's gonna shoot you.

986
01:06:50,205 --> 01:06:52,442
You're not the only one
that's hard up around here.

987
01:06:54,009 --> 01:06:55,211
We need that money.

988
01:07:04,986 --> 01:07:07,789
Tyler, what was that?

989
01:07:08,857 --> 01:07:11,127
Trouble. Problems.

990
01:07:20,902 --> 01:07:22,171
You upset with me?

991
01:07:37,451 --> 01:07:39,122
It ain't gonna happen no more.

992
01:07:49,397 --> 01:07:50,999
What's that "T" on your wrist?

993
01:07:54,435 --> 01:07:55,470
It's a "J".

994
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:56,906
What's the "J" on your wrist?

995
01:07:59,274 --> 01:08:00,343
Um...

996
01:08:02,009 --> 01:08:03,946
it was for my husband.

997
01:08:07,248 --> 01:08:10,386
- You're married?
- No, I'm not married anymore.

998
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,321
- You divorced?
- No.

999
01:08:14,388 --> 01:08:15,825
I'm a widow.

1000
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:24,933
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1001
01:08:30,404 --> 01:08:31,808
Don't be sorry.

1002
01:08:35,243 --> 01:08:36,511
We're really similar.

1003
01:08:41,015 --> 01:08:43,352
And not at all too.

1004
01:08:45,053 --> 01:08:46,988
I'm having some breakfast.

1005
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:48,090
Peanut butter.

1006
01:08:49,056 --> 01:08:51,059
- You're having some breakfast?
- Yeah.

1007
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:53,996
Hi, Glen.

1008
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:56,899
Yeah. Yes, I have him.

1009
01:08:56,931 --> 01:08:57,934
I...

1010
01:08:58,532 --> 01:09:00,535
He is sitting right next to me.

1011
01:09:01,269 --> 01:09:02,971
No, he's fine.

1012
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:05,006
Uh, he was alone.

1013
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:06,342
Yeah.

1014
01:09:07,975 --> 01:09:08,978
Mm-hmm.

1015
01:09:10,511 --> 01:09:12,314
No, there's no need
to send anybody.

1016
01:09:13,148 --> 01:09:14,183
I've got it.

1017
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:20,056
What?
No. Glen, that's not ne... I...

1018
01:09:22,323 --> 01:09:23,326
No.

1019
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:26,094
Cherry Hill is a place
where they send drug addicts

1020
01:09:26,127 --> 01:09:28,496
and prostitutes, not Zak.

1021
01:09:30,064 --> 01:09:32,067
Yes, I know,
I did label him a flight risk,

1022
01:09:32,099 --> 01:09:34,569
but I just think that he might
be better suited in an...

1023
01:09:37,672 --> 01:09:39,007
I understand what you're...

1024
01:09:41,209 --> 01:09:42,243
Okay.

1025
01:09:42,277 --> 01:09:43,312
- Boo-yeah!
- Okay,

1026
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:44,347
yeah, no, I get it.

1027
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:48,985
Okay, schedule his processing
for tomorrow afternoon then.

1028
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:54,223
Oh, you mighty thirsty,
here you go.

1029
01:09:57,059 --> 01:09:58,628
Can I get you
anything else, hon?

1030
01:10:00,662 --> 01:10:01,664
No, I'm...

1031
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:07,169
Actually, do you know
who the Salt Water Redneck is?

1032
01:10:07,202 --> 01:10:10,072
Oh, everybody
around here knows Salt Water.

1033
01:10:10,438 --> 01:10:11,940
He used to be a celebrity.

1034
01:10:15,376 --> 01:10:16,645
Do you know where he lives?

1035
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:21,617
Maybe it's...

1036
01:10:22,584 --> 01:10:24,086
- Let me see.
- Maybe it's not the right place.

1037
01:10:24,118 --> 01:10:25,554
This is the right place, 5-3-0.

1038
01:10:27,621 --> 01:10:28,957
Yeah, this is it.

1039
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:47,310
<i>Shit! Jesus Christ.</i>

1040
01:10:50,211 --> 01:10:51,279
Who're you?

1041
01:10:53,247 --> 01:10:54,450
You're Salt Water Redneck?

1042
01:11:00,121 --> 01:11:01,389
What is this?

1043
01:11:01,422 --> 01:11:03,358
I'm sorry,
is this the wrestling school?

1044
01:11:04,225 --> 01:11:05,227
Who's asking?

1045
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:06,962
My name's Tyler.

1046
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:11,100
I ain't selling nothing to you.
You see that boy back there?

1047
01:11:13,367 --> 01:11:16,205
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so, we done, uh...

1048
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:18,708
We done some hard traveling
to get to you.

1049
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:22,278
It's a big deal seeing you here.
You mind waving to him?

1050
01:11:24,679 --> 01:11:27,216
He's got a lot riding on you.
You mind just waving to him?

1051
01:11:28,282 --> 01:11:29,285
How you doing?

1052
01:11:30,251 --> 01:11:31,252
Hey.

1053
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:33,322
You don't teach no wrestling
school here no more?

1054
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:38,294
I closed that
about ten years ago.

1055
01:11:41,162 --> 01:11:42,163
Did you?

1056
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:51,640
So I promised him he would...
He would do this one thing.

1057
01:11:51,672 --> 01:11:53,242
You know, this wrestling thing.

1058
01:11:53,774 --> 01:11:55,745
And he told me
about this school here in Ayden.

1059
01:11:56,344 --> 01:11:59,582
And we had... We had
a big journey to get here.

1060
01:12:00,148 --> 01:12:01,150
And, uh...

1061
01:12:02,517 --> 01:12:04,318
now I got to break his heart,
you know?

1062
01:12:04,352 --> 01:12:06,287
And I don't really know
what to say to him.

1063
01:12:11,259 --> 01:12:12,560
But that ain't your shit,
you know?

1064
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:14,395
I don't mean to bring shit
to your doorstep

1065
01:12:14,429 --> 01:12:15,663
or nothing like that.

1066
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,234
What's your name?

1067
01:12:19,867 --> 01:12:21,236
- It's Clint.
- Clint.

1068
01:12:24,272 --> 01:12:25,373
It's nice to meet you.

1069
01:12:26,575 --> 01:12:27,742
So...

1070
01:12:28,542 --> 01:12:31,179
- ...he used to be a fan?
- Oh, man, shit,

1071
01:12:31,212 --> 01:12:32,247
you're his hero.

1072
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:34,616
He believes in you.
That's a hard thing to do,

1073
01:12:34,648 --> 01:12:35,817
believe in something, you know?

1074
01:12:38,353 --> 01:12:39,388
Hey, Zak.

1075
01:12:39,754 --> 01:12:40,788
Yeah.

1076
01:12:40,822 --> 01:12:41,824
This is Clint.

1077
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:43,559
- Hey, Clinton.
- Hey, come up here.

1078
01:12:43,591 --> 01:12:45,627
You mind if he comes
and says hi?

1079
01:12:46,327 --> 01:12:47,395
That'd be all right.

1080
01:12:48,496 --> 01:12:49,463
Hey, pal, Salt Water
don't live here no more.

1081
01:12:49,497 --> 01:12:52,468
But Clint's just a regular guy
like me or you.

1082
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:53,803
He wanted to shake your hand.

1083
01:12:54,702 --> 01:12:55,703
Hey.

1084
01:12:58,672 --> 01:13:00,576
- How are you doing?
- Good.

1085
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:02,311
Nice to meet you.

1086
01:13:03,511 --> 01:13:04,513
Thanks.

1087
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,083
All right, thanks, partner.
Come on, bub.

1088
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:10,118
Nice to meet you, Clint.

1089
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:23,666
Hey, Tyler.

1090
01:13:24,599 --> 01:13:25,601
What?

1091
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:31,407
I bet we could find him by...
By the raft.

1092
01:13:34,608 --> 01:13:37,513
Maybe he is hiding by the swamp.

1093
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,118
He's not real, bud.
Salt Water don't exist.

1094
01:13:43,251 --> 01:13:45,588
I saw the videotape...

1095
01:13:46,621 --> 01:13:49,591
and he is real.

1096
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:51,926
- He's not real, Zak.
- I just saw, like,

1097
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,895
a thousand movies of him.

1098
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:56,899
Zak, I don't think
we're going to find him.

1099
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:59,869
I think it's time for us
to go back now.

1100
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:01,837
I don't want to go back.

1101
01:14:02,403 --> 01:14:04,939
Tyler told me this,

1102
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:07,843
and he lied to me,
and he promised me.

1103
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:10,312
And I don't wanna go back.

1104
01:14:11,479 --> 01:14:12,748
I wanna stay here.

1105
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:16,417
We can't, Zak.
We have lives to go back to.

1106
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:20,355
Eleanor, I am strong enough.

1107
01:14:20,554 --> 01:14:22,423
And I could catch a fish
for you.

1108
01:14:22,456 --> 01:14:24,160
And I'm going to be a hero.

1109
01:14:24,759 --> 01:14:27,395
And... And I could
take care of you.

1110
01:14:27,761 --> 01:14:29,665
We could be a family.

1111
01:15:00,694 --> 01:15:02,197
Holy shit.

1112
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:03,931
Salt Water Redneck.

1113
01:15:03,965 --> 01:15:05,500
- It's you.
- Hey.

1114
01:15:05,532 --> 01:15:06,901
- Hey.
- How you doing, buddy?

1115
01:15:06,934 --> 01:15:07,902
I'm doing good.

1116
01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:11,240
- I am so happy to see you.
- I'm happy to see you.

1117
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:15,743
And for me, I... I...
I saw so many videos about you.

1118
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:17,746
Yeah? You want to learn
some wrestling?

1119
01:15:17,778 --> 01:15:19,647
Oh, hell, yeah.

1120
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:22,917
And I feel great.
Um, can I...

1121
01:15:23,451 --> 01:15:25,487
Uh, can I join you for the ride?

1122
01:15:25,519 --> 01:15:27,555
- Of course. Get in.
- And... And... And...

1123
01:15:27,589 --> 01:15:30,359
- And can I bring my family?
- Sure.

1124
01:15:31,826 --> 01:15:35,264
I told you. I told you.
I told you. He's real.

1125
01:15:35,729 --> 01:15:38,500
Come on. Join us.
Have some fun.

1126
01:15:39,901 --> 01:15:40,935
Hang on.

1127
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:48,542
The first thing you do is,

1128
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:50,879
you're gonna kind of just, like,
you're gonna feel out,

1129
01:15:50,912 --> 01:15:52,547
you know, how big the ring is.

1130
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:55,050
You just go, you know,
kind of check out,

1131
01:15:55,082 --> 01:15:56,617
you know, what your space is,

1132
01:15:56,651 --> 01:15:57,819
where you're gonna be
moving around.

1133
01:15:58,586 --> 01:16:00,856
All right, now,
one of the fundamentals

1134
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,958
is when you go to hit a guy
with an elbow.

1135
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:04,792
You got to hit a guy
with an elbow,

1136
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:06,362
but also do a foot stomp.

1137
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,296
Yeah.
But kind of pop your head too.

1138
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:09,730
Just gives it more energy.

1139
01:16:09,764 --> 01:16:11,333
Yeah. Okay, that's good.

1140
01:16:11,599 --> 01:16:14,536
Um, was there anything special
in the video

1141
01:16:14,769 --> 01:16:15,770
that you want me to teach you?

1142
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:19,408
Uh, will you please show me
the Atomic Throw?

1143
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:21,510
Ah.

1144
01:16:21,542 --> 01:16:22,911
Yeah, the Atomic Throw.

1145
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:24,946
Honestly, Zak,
we just made that up.

1146
01:16:24,979 --> 01:16:26,648
You know,
it was smoke and mirrors.

1147
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,317
It was just a camera on my face.

1148
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:30,986
And then it looked like I was
holding the guy up over my head,

1149
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:33,656
and then we'd cut to a guy
getting thrown out of the ring.

1150
01:16:33,921 --> 01:16:35,623
It's not possible to do.

1151
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:37,493
But I can show you a lot
of other cool stuff.

1152
01:16:37,826 --> 01:16:39,094
What do you think, Sam?

1153
01:16:39,126 --> 01:16:40,895
Might try a collar
and elbow lockup.

1154
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,464
There you go, a lockup.

1155
01:16:42,496 --> 01:16:44,465
All right, now, what you do,

1156
01:16:44,498 --> 01:16:46,001
you come in and boom,
right there, boom.

1157
01:16:46,634 --> 01:16:48,670
You know, boom, boom.

1158
01:16:48,702 --> 01:16:50,404
But when you come in to do it,

1159
01:16:50,438 --> 01:16:52,607
you got to really, really,
really slam...

1160
01:16:52,639 --> 01:16:54,343
Yeah.

1161
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:55,744
Yeah. Growl all you want.

1162
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:57,579
See? Then we kind of...

1163
01:16:57,612 --> 01:16:59,681
Now we can move around
a little bit, like this.

1164
01:16:59,714 --> 01:17:01,350
You don't know
what I'm going to do...

1165
01:17:01,382 --> 01:17:02,518
What are you gonna do?

1166
01:17:04,486 --> 01:17:05,653
What do you mean?

1167
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:07,555
I mean,
what are you going to do

1168
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:10,893
after all this is over?

1169
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,730
Well, I'm gonna settle
my debts with Duncan.

1170
01:17:16,764 --> 01:17:18,866
I'mma go up to Jupiter, Florida.

1171
01:17:21,669 --> 01:17:24,473
Town called Jupiter up there
is a small little fishing town.

1172
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:26,041
It's on the Indian River,

1173
01:17:26,073 --> 01:17:28,443
and it opens up
to this big estuary.

1174
01:17:30,478 --> 01:17:31,813
It's the biggest estuary
in America.

1175
01:17:31,845 --> 01:17:33,549
I'm gonna get a boat
and I'm gonna...

1176
01:17:34,616 --> 01:17:35,551
just live a good life.

1177
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:38,519
Run charters
and take people sport fishing.

1178
01:17:42,489 --> 01:17:43,657
You ever been to Florida?

1179
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:45,394
- Uh-uh.
- No?

1180
01:17:46,961 --> 01:17:48,097
You want to go?

1181
01:17:49,863 --> 01:17:51,567
- To Florida?
- Yeah.

1182
01:18:00,675 --> 01:18:01,943
You know, certain things,

1183
01:18:01,975 --> 01:18:02,876
it takes years to learn.

1184
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:05,514
Like how to fall
without hurting yourself.

1185
01:18:05,546 --> 01:18:07,047
But then that stuff
just comes with time.

1186
01:18:07,081 --> 01:18:08,850
- As long as you don't do...
- It takes

1187
01:18:08,882 --> 01:18:10,452
- so much time.
- Yeah, it takes time,

1188
01:18:10,484 --> 01:18:12,453
but as long as
you don't do the same move

1189
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:14,189
in the same bout,
you're good to go.

1190
01:18:14,221 --> 01:18:15,791
- You look real.
- Oh, yeah,

1191
01:18:15,823 --> 01:18:17,558
and I'm totally ready
to do this.

1192
01:18:18,893 --> 01:18:20,095
You want to fight for real?

1193
01:18:20,127 --> 01:18:23,866
- Yeah. For-real match.
- For real?

1194
01:18:24,198 --> 01:18:25,800
You want to do a match?

1195
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:26,734
Ho-ho.

1196
01:18:26,769 --> 01:18:29,738
Oh, yeah, seriously. Yeah.
I love it.

1197
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:31,105
Good. That's great.

1198
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:32,707
I don'...
I don't think he's ready.

1199
01:18:32,739 --> 01:18:34,742
Oh, look it,
he can't just be out here

1200
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:36,944
practicing all the time.
He did great today.

1201
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:38,413
We can set that up.

1202
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:42,451
I mean, there's... There's a card
in Jacob's backyard tomorrow.

1203
01:18:42,483 --> 01:18:44,018
I mean,
you're fighting on that card.

1204
01:18:44,051 --> 01:18:46,455
- Yeah.
- Okay. Y'all two can fight.

1205
01:18:46,487 --> 01:18:48,589
- Hey!
- That's outstanding.

1206
01:18:48,922 --> 01:18:49,957
A real match.

1207
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:51,493
You want to fight Samson?

1208
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:53,060
- Hell, yeah.
- Good.

1209
01:18:53,094 --> 01:18:54,830
Yes, I do. Tomorrow.

1210
01:18:54,862 --> 01:18:56,197
Oh, man!

1211
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:57,599
Yeah, take on Sam.

1212
01:18:57,631 --> 01:18:59,768
Um, yo, um, please,

1213
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:02,236
don't mess with
the Peanut Butter Falcon.

1214
01:19:02,269 --> 01:19:03,971
Peanut Butter Falcon
in the house.

1215
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:06,675
I see a problem here.
Uh, seems a bit soon.

1216
01:19:06,707 --> 01:19:08,108
- He's great.
- Really?

1217
01:19:08,142 --> 01:19:09,810
- Yeah!
- I'm gonna be there.

1218
01:19:09,844 --> 01:19:11,947
He's going to take care of him.
It'll be like dancing.

1219
01:19:11,979 --> 01:19:13,948
- Oh, yeah.
- Uh-hmm. Oh, yeah.

1220
01:19:13,982 --> 01:19:16,218
- Sam?
- Really? Yeah.

1221
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:18,153
Oh, come on, man.
He's in, he's in.

1222
01:19:18,185 --> 01:19:20,255
He's grumpy. He's in.

1223
01:19:20,287 --> 01:19:22,089
Just let him lead, huh?

1224
01:19:22,122 --> 01:19:23,157
All right, yeah.

1225
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:18,146
Look, I need you to put
somebody else on the card

1226
01:20:18,179 --> 01:20:19,781
to fight Samson.

1227
01:20:19,813 --> 01:20:21,582
- Yeah, look over there.
- Looks kind of lean,

1228
01:20:21,616 --> 01:20:23,752
kind of wiry,
like a swimmer's physique.

1229
01:20:23,785 --> 01:20:26,121
No, no, not him.
The little guy.

1230
01:20:34,929 --> 01:20:37,733
Ooh!

1231
01:20:40,768 --> 01:20:44,573
All right.

1232
01:20:47,274 --> 01:20:49,176
Had to grease the wheels
a little bit,

1233
01:20:49,210 --> 01:20:51,078
but, Zak, you're good, buddy.
You're fighting.

1234
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:53,047
You want to fight?
They'll take girls.

1235
01:20:53,747 --> 01:20:56,285
Okay. All right. Yeah.

1236
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:59,020
Yeah, Tyler's here.

1237
01:21:00,254 --> 01:21:02,056
At this wrestling thing
in Ayden.

1238
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:15,102
Zak! One thing
you got to remember, buddy.

1239
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:17,772
Huge part of the game
is smack talk.

1240
01:21:17,804 --> 01:21:19,607
As soon as you set foot
in that ring,

1241
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:21,676
I want you to say the meanest,

1242
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:24,913
evilest thing that comes
into your head, Zak, okay?

1243
01:21:24,946 --> 01:21:27,948
You got to go in aggressive.
He is gonna hit you.

1244
01:21:27,982 --> 01:21:29,818
He's gonna hit you,
but you come back harder!

1245
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:31,620
Harder, Zak, all right?

1246
01:21:31,653 --> 01:21:35,257
Oh, one last thing, okay?
It may not even happen.

1247
01:21:35,822 --> 01:21:38,058
If you start bleeding, though,
take it to your advantage.

1248
01:21:38,091 --> 01:21:40,060
All right? Rub it
on your face a little bit.

1249
01:21:40,094 --> 01:21:42,197
Get it on your hands.
He hates that.

1250
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:43,965
He believes in vampires
and shit.

1251
01:21:43,997 --> 01:21:45,866
All right, I think that's it.

1252
01:21:45,899 --> 01:21:48,236
It's a Zak attack time.
How are you feeling?

1253
01:21:48,269 --> 01:21:50,705
You ready?

1254
01:21:50,737 --> 01:21:53,007
Oh, you're up. Yeah!

1255
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:54,810
Oh, I wish I was in there
with you.

1256
01:21:58,813 --> 01:22:00,916
- Tyler.
- What?

1257
01:22:01,882 --> 01:22:04,285
- I'm scared.
- No, don't do that right now.

1258
01:22:04,318 --> 01:22:06,288
Hey, hey!
Don't do that right now.

1259
01:22:07,054 --> 01:22:08,989
I know you got this, Zak.
You got this.

1260
01:22:09,023 --> 01:22:10,959
I know you can do this.
Say, "I got this."

1261
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:12,360
You've been out here.
You got this.

1262
01:22:12,393 --> 01:22:13,662
Say, "I got this."

1263
01:22:13,694 --> 01:22:14,729
- I got this.
- No, not...

1264
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:16,864
like you're asking a question.
Like you mean it.

1265
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:17,866
Mean it. Mean it.

1266
01:22:17,898 --> 01:22:20,067
In your heart you know it.
Say, "I got this."

1267
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:21,435
- I got this.
- I got this.

1268
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:23,104
- I got this.
- Mean it.

1269
01:22:23,136 --> 01:22:24,372
Make me believe it.

1270
01:22:25,005 --> 01:22:26,107
I got this.

1271
01:22:28,408 --> 01:22:30,245
I got this!

1272
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:31,880
- Do it again.
- I got this!

1273
01:22:31,912 --> 01:22:34,248
- Say it! Say it!
- I got this!

1274
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:37,018
It's you. There he is.
Peanut Butter Falcon. Ready?

1275
01:22:37,050 --> 01:22:38,986
You're going to win.
You just got to show up.

1276
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:42,190
Take your shirt off.
We got to find some cardboard.

1277
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:43,457
Wait, wait.
Come here, come here.

1278
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:44,926
Get this box. Get this box.

1279
01:22:44,959 --> 01:22:46,094
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1280
01:22:46,827 --> 01:22:49,063
- can you feel it?
- Yeah!

1281
01:22:49,096 --> 01:22:52,267
- I said, can you feel it?
- Yeah!

1282
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:55,103
- Can you feel the heat?
- Yeah!

1283
01:22:55,135 --> 01:22:56,705
I understand why
you took me out here,

1284
01:22:56,737 --> 01:22:57,672
but there ain't no reason
to be scared.

1285
01:22:57,706 --> 01:22:59,074
We're talking about
two different matches.

1286
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:00,709
You're talking about
a hard-core match,

1287
01:23:00,742 --> 01:23:02,110
which was what
you just sat through,

1288
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:03,978
and then what Zak's
gonna be doing,

1289
01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:05,714
which ain't gonna be
the same match.

1290
01:23:05,746 --> 01:23:06,714
- No.
- He's gonna do a couple moves,

1291
01:23:06,747 --> 01:23:08,015
he's going to lay down,
it's going to be simple,

1292
01:23:09,216 --> 01:23:10,117
and that's gonna be that.
Zak's gonna win and we go home.

1293
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:10,984
Tyler,
They don't care about him.

1294
01:23:11,019 --> 01:23:11,753
- I care about him.
- I know.

1295
01:23:11,786 --> 01:23:14,890
We care about him.
They don't.

1296
01:23:15,822 --> 01:23:17,392
Well, that was going
to be the case,

1297
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:19,127
but then,
at the very last moment,

1298
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,328
an old friend stopped by.

1299
01:23:21,362 --> 01:23:22,497
- Who?
- Who was it?

1300
01:23:22,529 --> 01:23:24,264
The Salt Water Redneck.

1301
01:23:26,867 --> 01:23:28,836
The Salt Water Redneck
stopped by.

1302
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:32,174
He brought with him tonight
a protégé.

1303
01:23:37,077 --> 01:23:38,080
Okay.

1304
01:23:38,545 --> 01:23:39,847
Okay?

1305
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:40,781
Yeah.

1306
01:23:57,230 --> 01:23:59,032
- You want popcorn?
- Tyler... Oh, my God.

1307
01:23:59,065 --> 01:24:00,769
- Tyler, what the...
- I'll get you popcorn.

1308
01:24:00,801 --> 01:24:01,902
Are you kidding me?

1309
01:24:01,935 --> 01:24:03,203
Don't worry. You're good.

1310
01:24:03,237 --> 01:24:04,873
- Oh, my God.
- Nobody's gonna die today.

1311
01:24:04,906 --> 01:24:06,207
I'll be right back.

1312
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:08,542
May I present to you...

1313
01:24:14,881 --> 01:24:19,286
...the Peanut Butter Falcon!

1314
01:24:24,257 --> 01:24:25,326
Let's go, let's go!

1315
01:24:27,528 --> 01:24:30,498
Hey! Woo!

1316
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:33,768
He's wearing a freaking
cardboard box.

1317
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:42,210
Falcon time!

1318
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:47,849
Here we go, here we go.
Fly around, baby!

1319
01:24:47,881 --> 01:24:49,317
Fly around, baby!

1320
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:52,854
Woo!

1321
01:24:54,121 --> 01:24:56,457
The Falcon! Falcon!

1322
01:25:00,327 --> 01:25:01,428
Woo!

1323
01:25:01,461 --> 01:25:02,830
All right, Zak.

1324
01:25:17,577 --> 01:25:22,149
Peanut Butter Falcon!
Peanut Butter Falcon!

1325
01:25:22,183 --> 01:25:25,220
Peanut Butter Falcon!
Peanut Butter Falcon!

1326
01:25:25,252 --> 01:25:27,554
Peanut Butter Falcon!
Peanut Butter Falcon!

1327
01:25:27,587 --> 01:25:30,157
Peanut Butter Falcon!
Peanut Butter Falcon!

1328
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:31,392
Peanut Butter Falcon!

1329
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:37,098
Peanut Butter Falcon!
Peanut Butter Falcon!

1330
01:25:40,434 --> 01:25:42,204
Who's ready for some wrestling?

1331
01:25:45,072 --> 01:25:47,575
Peanut Butter Falcon!
Peanut Butter Falcon!

1332
01:25:47,608 --> 01:25:49,277
Peanut Butter Falcon!

1333
01:25:51,379 --> 01:25:52,513
Woo!

1334
01:25:56,483 --> 01:25:58,053
Come on, Zak!

1335
01:26:01,188 --> 01:26:02,457
Zak, say something.

1336
01:26:02,489 --> 01:26:04,959
What do you think
about that, huh?

1337
01:26:04,992 --> 01:26:07,896
I've been doing this
for 38 years,

1338
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:09,029
and guess what?

1339
01:26:09,229 --> 01:26:11,431
This isn't
Make-A-Wish Foundation

1340
01:26:11,465 --> 01:26:13,535
Kick out, Zak.
Kick out that leg!

1341
01:26:15,303 --> 01:26:17,272
Legs! Kick out!

1342
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:20,408
There you go, there you go.
Get up, get up! Recover.

1343
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:23,245
Oh, son, you messed up.

1344
01:26:23,944 --> 01:26:25,179
You want to play some more?

1345
01:26:27,415 --> 01:26:29,149
Get up, Zak. Get up.

1346
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:30,684
Samson.

1347
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:33,020
The Peanut Butter Falcon?

1348
01:26:33,054 --> 01:26:35,189
Are you ser...
How about Tweety Bird?

1349
01:26:35,221 --> 01:26:36,657
That's more like it.
Tweety Bird.

1350
01:26:36,690 --> 01:26:38,693
Get up. Get up, boy.
Get up, boy. Fight.

1351
01:26:38,725 --> 01:26:39,960
Come on, Zak.

1352
01:26:39,993 --> 01:26:41,395
You wanna play some more?

1353
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:42,197
Come on, Zak.

1354
01:26:42,229 --> 01:26:43,931
You know,
I've had enough of you.

1355
01:26:46,267 --> 01:26:48,670
Samson! We had an agreement!

1356
01:26:48,702 --> 01:26:50,938
Don't come to me
and expect favors.

1357
01:26:50,971 --> 01:26:52,974
- Bullshit.
- Get up. Get up, Zak.

1358
01:26:53,206 --> 01:26:56,277
What else do you want?
You stupid little punk.

1359
01:26:57,278 --> 01:26:58,313
You're going down.

1360
01:27:01,114 --> 01:27:03,017
Retard, get up, man.

1361
01:27:03,050 --> 01:27:05,353
Get your stinking ass
out of the ring, man.

1362
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:25,172
Oh, my God.

1363
01:27:27,174 --> 01:27:29,477
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

1364
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:31,513
Look at me.
Hey, hey, look at me.

1365
01:27:32,013 --> 01:27:33,648
Let me know,
you want to do this anymore?

1366
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:35,683
Then get up now.

1367
01:27:35,715 --> 01:27:37,617
Lighten up, Sam.
You're a piece of shit.

1368
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:41,089
Say something, Zak.

1369
01:27:41,121 --> 01:27:43,290
Come on, Zak!
Come on, Zak! Come on, Zak!

1370
01:27:47,728 --> 01:27:50,165
- Excuse me, Samson.
- What?

1371
01:27:51,364 --> 01:27:54,068
You are not invited
to my birthday party!

1372
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:56,438
Go, Zak. Go, Zak. Run, run!

1373
01:27:57,203 --> 01:27:59,407
- Yeah.
- Go underneath! Up! Up!

1374
01:29:47,214 --> 01:29:49,117
- Let's just start from there.
- Yeah.

1375
01:29:49,149 --> 01:29:52,319
Boom. Boom. Boom.

1376
01:29:53,453 --> 01:29:54,855
- Boom.
- Boom.

1377
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:56,157
There you go.

1378
01:29:56,189 --> 01:29:57,357
You wanna hug?

1379
01:29:57,925 --> 01:30:00,294
A little tap of a hug
or just a straight hug?

1380
01:30:00,327 --> 01:30:02,163
- Straight hug.
- Straight hug.

1381
01:30:29,523 --> 01:30:30,525
Zak.

1382
01:30:30,957 --> 01:30:32,160
Zak.

1383
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:35,163
Look.

1384
01:30:36,729 --> 01:30:38,398
Florida.

1385
01:30:39,567 --> 01:30:41,136
We are in Florida.

1386
01:30:43,703 --> 01:30:46,607
We... We are here in Florida.

1387
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:48,876
We made it.

1388
01:31:15,469 --> 01:31:17,931
