1
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:40,010
These are dark times, there is no denying.

2
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:46,069
Our world has, perhaps,
faced no greater threat than it does today.

3
00:00:46,772 --> 00:00:50,731
But I say this to our citizenry:

4
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:54,643
We, ever your servants...

5
00:00:54,645 --> 00:00:57,307
...will continue to defend your liberty...

6
00:00:57,365 --> 00:01:01,699
...and repel the forces
that seek to take it from you.

7
00:01:02,677 --> 00:01:07,944
Your Ministry remains...

8
00:01:08,244 --> 00:01:10,212
...strong.

9
00:01:26,773 --> 00:01:28,968
Hermione. Tea's ready, darling.

10
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:30,979
Coming, Mom.

11
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,577
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

12
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:39,687
I still don't understand
why we have to leave.

13
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:44,500
Because, unh,
it's not safe for us here anymore.

14
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:03,430
Ron, tell your father
supper's nearly ready.

15
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:09,782
Is this in Australia?

16
00:02:09,877 --> 00:02:11,845
Looks wonderful, doesn't it?

17
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:16,794
Three and a half thousand
kilometers along Australia's east coast.

18
00:02:17,845 --> 00:02:19,369
Obliviate.

19
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,811
Severus.

20
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,277
I was beginning to worry
you had lost your way.

21
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:36,760
Come, we've saved you a seat.

22
00:04:40,886 --> 00:04:42,217
You bring news, I trust?

23
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:45,988
It will happen Saturday next, at nightfall.

24
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:48,372
I've heard differently, my Lord.

25
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:51,565
Dawlish, the Auror,
has let slip that the Potter boy...

26
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:54,700
...will not be moved
until the 30th of this month.

27
00:04:54,998 --> 00:04:56,260
The day before he turns 17.

28
00:04:56,374 --> 00:04:59,605
This is a false trail.

29
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:04,282
The Auror Office no longer plays any part
in the protection of Harry Potter.

30
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:08,647
Those closest to him believe
we have infiltrated the Ministry.

31
00:05:09,046 --> 00:05:10,638
Well, they got that right, haven't they?

32
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:17,338
What say you, Pius?

33
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,224
One hears many things, my Lord.

34
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:25,846
Whether the truth is among them
is not clear.

35
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,277
Heh. Spoken like a true politician.

36
00:05:29,302 --> 00:05:32,362
You will, I think,
prove most useful, Pius.

37
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,933
- Where will he be taken, the boy?
- To a safe house.

38
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,818
Most likely the home of someone
in the Order.

39
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:45,109
I'm told it's been given
every manner of protection possible.

40
00:05:45,142 --> 00:05:48,737
Once there,
it will be impractical to attack him.

41
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,696
Ahem. My Lord.
I'd like to volunteer myself for this task.

42
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:54,644
I want to kill the boy.

43
00:05:55,894 --> 00:05:57,122
Wormtail!

44
00:05:57,238 --> 00:06:00,207
Have I not spoken to you
about keeping our guest quiet?

45
00:06:00,246 --> 00:06:02,146
Yes, my Lord.

46
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,892
Right away, my Lord.

47
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:09,508
As inspiring
as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix...

48
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,049
...I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.

49
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:20,088
But I face an unfortunate complication.

50
00:06:20,054 --> 00:06:25,253
That my wand and Potter's
share the same core.

51
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:32,794
They are, in some ways, twins.

52
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:37,393
We can wound,
but not fatally harm one another.

53
00:06:38,742 --> 00:06:41,540
If I am to kill him...

54
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:45,837
...I must do it with another's wand.

55
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:53,307
Come,
surely one of you would like the honor?

56
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,275
Mm?

57
00:06:57,846 --> 00:07:02,647
What about you, Lucius?

58
00:07:04,855 --> 00:07:06,254
My Lord?

59
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,327
"My Lord?"

60
00:07:09,271 --> 00:07:12,900
I require your wand.

61
00:07:25,526 --> 00:07:27,994
Do I detect elm?

62
00:07:28,054 --> 00:07:30,022
Yes, my Lord.

63
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,574
And the core?

64
00:07:38,614 --> 00:07:40,809
Dragon. Ahem.

65
00:07:40,886 --> 00:07:42,513
Dragon heartstring, my Lord.

66
00:07:42,615 --> 00:07:44,810
- Dragon heartstring.
- Mm.

67
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:01,562
To those of you who do not know...

68
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:04,317
...we are joined tonight
by Miss Charity Burbage...

69
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:09,870
...who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

70
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:13,273
Her specialty was Muggle Studies.

71
00:08:16,215 --> 00:08:22,484
It is Miss Burbage's belief
that Muggles are not so different from us.

72
00:08:22,391 --> 00:08:26,020
She would, given her way...

73
00:08:26,615 --> 00:08:28,549
...have us mate with them.

74
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:38,191
To her, the mixture of magical
and Muggle blood is not an abomination...

75
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:41,129
...but something to be encouraged.

76
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,904
Severus.

77
00:08:43,992 --> 00:08:45,960
Severus, please.

78
00:08:47,479 --> 00:08:49,640
We're friends.

79
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:55,694
Avada Kedavra!

80
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:07,489
Nagini.

81
00:09:10,872 --> 00:09:12,533
Dinner.

82
00:10:53,464 --> 00:10:56,865
- Hello, Harry.
- All right. Wow.

83
00:10:56,888 --> 00:10:57,980
Hello.

84
00:10:58,104 --> 00:11:01,005
- You're looking fit.
- Yeah, he's absolutely gorgeous.

85
00:11:01,048 --> 00:11:03,516
What say we get undercover
before someone murders him?

86
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:04,600
Evening.

87
00:11:09,272 --> 00:11:11,672
I thought you were
looking after the Prime Minister.

88
00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:13,636
You are more important.

89
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,780
- Hello, Harry. Bill Weasley.
- Oh. Pleasure to meet you.

90
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:19,816
- He was never always this handsome.
- Dead ugly.

91
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:21,264
True enough.

92
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:23,893
Owe it all to a werewolf,
name of Greyback.

93
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,327
- Hope to repay the favor one day.
- You're still beautiful to me, William.

94
00:11:27,545 --> 00:11:31,174
Just remember, Fleur,
Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now.

95
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:33,524
My husband, the joker.

96
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:36,857
By the way, wait till you hear the news.
Remus and I--

97
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:39,323
All right. We'll have time
for a cozy catch-up later.

98
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:42,353
We've got to get the hell out of here.
And soon.

99
00:11:42,872 --> 00:11:46,137
Potter, you're underage, which means
you've still got the Trace on you.

100
00:11:46,168 --> 00:11:47,192
What's the Trace?

101
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,982
If you sneeze, the Ministry will know
who wipes your nose.

102
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,203
We have to use those means of transport
the Trace can't detect:

103
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,572
Brooms, Thestrals and the like.
We go in pairs.

104
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,406
That way, if anyone's out there waiting
for us, and I reckon there will be...

105
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,908
...they won't know which Harry Potter
is the real one.

106
00:12:02,232 --> 00:12:03,392
The real one?

107
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:07,727
I believe you're familiar
with this particular brew.

108
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,066
No. Absolutely not.

109
00:12:10,137 --> 00:12:11,468
I told you he'd take it well.

110
00:12:11,576 --> 00:12:14,704
No, if you think I'm gonna let everyone
risk their lives for me, I--

111
00:12:14,744 --> 00:12:17,804
- Never done that before, have we?
- No. No. This is different.

112
00:12:17,848 --> 00:12:19,839
I mean, taking that, becoming me. No.

113
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:21,760
Well, none of us really fancy it, mate.

114
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:26,013
Imagine if something went wrong, and
we ended up a scrawny, specky git forever.

115
00:12:26,008 --> 00:12:27,669
Everyone here is of age, Potter.

116
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,713
They've all agreed to take the risk.

117
00:12:30,968 --> 00:12:33,869
Technically, I've been coerced.

118
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:36,107
Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter.

119
00:12:36,184 --> 00:12:38,744
- Always been a huge admirer.
- Nip it, Mundungus.

120
00:12:39,897 --> 00:12:42,388
All right, Granger, as discussed.

121
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:45,187
- Blimey, Hermione.
- Straight in here, if you please.

122
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,718
For those of you who haven't taken
Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning:

123
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:00,339
It tastes like goblin piss.

124
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:03,410
Have a lot of experiences with that,
do you, Mad-Eye?

125
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:07,088
Just trying to diffuse the tension.

126
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:09,758
Oh.

127
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:14,396
Ugh.

128
00:13:37,593 --> 00:13:39,652
Wow, we're identical.

129
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:40,795
Not yet, you're not.

130
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,841
Haven't got anything
a bit more sporting, have you?

131
00:13:46,905 --> 00:13:48,372
I don't really fancy this color.

132
00:13:48,473 --> 00:13:51,271
Well, fancy this, you're not you.
So shut it and strip.

133
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:52,879
All right, all right.

134
00:13:52,985 --> 00:13:54,543
You'll need to change too, Potter.

135
00:13:54,969 --> 00:13:57,597
Bill, look away. I'm hideous.

136
00:13:57,657 --> 00:13:59,955
I knew she was lying about that tattoo.

137
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:02,459
Harry, your eyesight really is awful.

138
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:06,218
Right, then. We'll be pairing off.
Each Potter will have a protector.

139
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:09,532
Mundungus, stick tight to me.
I wanna keep an eye on you.

140
00:14:09,913 --> 00:14:11,744
- As for Harry--
- Yes?

141
00:14:12,473 --> 00:14:13,872
The real Harry.

142
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:16,343
- Where the devil are you, anyway?
- Here.

143
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:18,377
You'll ride with Hagrid.

144
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:23,485
I brought you here 16 years ago when
you were no bigger than a Bowtruckle.

145
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:26,350
Seems only right that I should be
the one to take you away now.

146
00:14:26,393 --> 00:14:29,328
Yes, it's all very touching. Let's go.

147
00:14:41,977 --> 00:14:45,879
Head for the Burrows.
We'll rendezvous there.

148
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:48,292
On the count of three.

149
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:50,106
Hold tight, Harry.

150
00:14:50,202 --> 00:14:51,999
One...

151
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,558
...two...

152
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,430
...three!

153
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,293
- Which one?
- Where are you?

154
00:15:35,322 --> 00:15:37,051
He's on your right!

155
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:38,773
He's over there!

156
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:40,534
Down!

157
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:47,383
Hagrid, we have to help the others!

158
00:15:47,706 --> 00:15:50,607
I can't do that, Harry. Mad-Eye's orders.

159
00:15:57,146 --> 00:15:58,943
Hang on.

160
00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:04,580
Stupefy!

161
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:18,750
Hang on, Harry.

162
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:30,083
Hagrid.

163
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:48,785
No. No.

164
00:17:09,882 --> 00:17:11,873
Harry.

165
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:31,535
Harry. Hagrid.

166
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:36,221
What happened? Where are the others?

167
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:37,411
Is no one else back?

168
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,091
They were on us right from
the start, Molly. We didn't stand a chance.

169
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:44,278
Well, thank goodness
you two are all right.

170
00:18:44,314 --> 00:18:46,874
The Death Eaters were
waiting for us. It was an ambush.

171
00:18:46,938 --> 00:18:49,338
Ron and Tonks
should've already been back.

172
00:18:49,402 --> 00:18:50,596
Dad and Fred as well.

173
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:55,032
Here!

174
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:59,014
Quick. Into the house.

175
00:19:02,394 --> 00:19:04,453
Oh, my boy.

176
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:08,950
Oh. Oh.

177
00:19:10,395 --> 00:19:11,692
- Lupin!
- What are you doing?

178
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:17,010
What creature sat in the corner...

179
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,349
...the first time Harry Potter
visited my office in Hogwarts?

180
00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:22,005
- Are you mad?
- What creature?!

181
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:23,938
A Grindylow.

182
00:19:29,947 --> 00:19:31,608
We've been betrayed.

183
00:19:31,707 --> 00:19:34,107
Voldemort knew
you were being moved tonight.

184
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,071
I had to make sure
you weren't an impostor.

185
00:19:43,803 --> 00:19:45,236
Wait.

186
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:52,587
The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke
to the pair of us?

187
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:58,508
"Harry is the best hope we have.
Trust him."

188
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:03,775
What gave you away?

189
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:07,096
Hedwig, I think.
She was trying to protect me.

190
00:20:22,843 --> 00:20:24,003
Thanks.

191
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:26,284
Deserves that. Brilliant, he was.

192
00:20:26,363 --> 00:20:29,457
- I wouldn't be standing here without him.
- Really?

193
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,962
Always the tone of surprise.

194
00:20:40,731 --> 00:20:41,925
We the last back?

195
00:20:43,132 --> 00:20:44,156
Where's George?

196
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:06,769
How you feeling, Georgie?

197
00:21:08,603 --> 00:21:10,127
Saint-like.

198
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,456
Come again?

199
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:16,868
Saint-like. I'm holy.

200
00:21:17,211 --> 00:21:20,271
I'm holey, Fred. Get it?

201
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:26,583
The whole wide world of ear-related humor
and you go for "I'm holey."

202
00:21:26,555 --> 00:21:27,715
That's pathetic.

203
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:30,550
Reckon I'm still better-looking than you.

204
00:21:33,852 --> 00:21:36,047
Mad-Eye's dead.

205
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:49,647
Mundungus took one look at Voldemort
and Disapparated.

206
00:22:11,484 --> 00:22:13,509
Head for the Burrows.

207
00:22:14,204 --> 00:22:15,569
This is beyond anything I imagined.

208
00:22:15,676 --> 00:22:18,304
- Seven?
- Seven...? A Horcrux.

209
00:22:18,364 --> 00:22:19,797
They could be hidden anywhere.

210
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:22,094
To rip the soul into seven pieces....

211
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:25,140
- If you did destroy each Horcrux....
- One destroys Voldemort.

212
00:22:28,476 --> 00:22:30,103
Trust me.

213
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,501
You lied to me. Lied to me, Ollivander.

214
00:23:04,988 --> 00:23:06,922
Going somewhere?

215
00:23:10,364 --> 00:23:14,460
Nobody else is going to die. Not for me.

216
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,257
For you?

217
00:23:16,348 --> 00:23:18,578
You think Mad-Eye died for you?

218
00:23:18,652 --> 00:23:21,587
You think George took that curse
for you?

219
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:26,140
You may be the Chosen One, mate,
but this is a whole lot bigger than that.

220
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,665
It's always been bigger than that.

221
00:23:30,684 --> 00:23:33,175
- Come with me.
- What, and leave Hermione?

222
00:23:33,532 --> 00:23:37,764
You mad?
We wouldn't last two days without her.

223
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,464
Don't tell her I said that.

224
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:45,113
Besides,
you've still got the Trace on you.

225
00:23:45,148 --> 00:23:49,244
- We've still got the wedding--
- I don't care about a wedding.

226
00:23:49,244 --> 00:23:54,113
I'm sorry. No matter whose it is.
I have to start finding these Horcruxes.

227
00:23:54,077 --> 00:23:56,045
They're our only chance to beat him...

228
00:23:56,124 --> 00:23:59,093
...and the longer we stay here,
the stronger he gets.

229
00:24:00,348 --> 00:24:02,441
Tonight's not the night, mate.

230
00:24:02,652 --> 00:24:05,120
We'd only be doing him a favor.

231
00:24:31,644 --> 00:24:33,578
Do you think he knows?

232
00:24:34,204 --> 00:24:40,074
I mean, they're bits of his soul,
these Horcruxes. Bits of him.

233
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:44,807
When Dumbledore destroyed the ring,
you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary...

234
00:24:46,076 --> 00:24:48,670
...he must have felt something.

235
00:24:49,308 --> 00:24:53,039
To kill the other Horcruxes,
we have to find them.

236
00:24:53,244 --> 00:24:55,212
Where are they?

237
00:24:55,645 --> 00:24:57,704
Where do we start?

238
00:25:00,924 --> 00:25:02,016
Ready when you are.

239
00:25:03,645 --> 00:25:07,945
Please pay attention!
It's your brother's wedding. Buck up.

240
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:34,215
Zip me up, will you?

241
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,355
It seems silly, doesn't it, a wedding?

242
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:52,123
Given everything that's going on.

243
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:55,368
Maybe that's the best reason to have it...

244
00:25:55,869 --> 00:25:58,394
...because of everything that's going on.

245
00:26:13,693 --> 00:26:15,854
Morning.

246
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:27,694
Come on, keep up.

247
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,914
All together now.

248
00:26:30,013 --> 00:26:35,451
One, two, three.

249
00:26:44,893 --> 00:26:47,327
How's it looking at your end, boys?

250
00:26:47,838 --> 00:26:49,772
Brilliant.

251
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:56,544
Bloody hell.
What's the Minister of Magic doing here?

252
00:27:02,013 --> 00:27:03,878
To what do we owe the pleasure,
Minister?

253
00:27:03,965 --> 00:27:08,527
I think we both know the answer
to that question, Mr. Potter.

254
00:27:15,709 --> 00:27:17,609
And this is...?

255
00:27:25,245 --> 00:27:29,147
"Herein is set forth
the last will and testament...

256
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:33,746
...of Albus Percival Wulfric
Brian Dumbledore.

257
00:27:33,725 --> 00:27:38,185
First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley...

258
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:41,472
...I leave my Deluminator...

259
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:43,765
...a device of my own making...

260
00:27:43,837 --> 00:27:49,070
...in the hope that,
when things seem most dark...

261
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:53,297
...it will show him the light."

262
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:01,939
- Dumbledore left this for me?
- Yeah.

263
00:28:02,718 --> 00:28:04,310
Brilliant.

264
00:28:05,245 --> 00:28:07,076
What is it?

265
00:28:18,654 --> 00:28:20,246
Wicked.

266
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:25,367
"To Hermione Jean Granger...

267
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:30,570
...I leave my copy of
The Tales of Beedle the Bard...

268
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:35,190
...in the hope that she find it
entertaining and instructive."

269
00:28:35,774 --> 00:28:37,105
Mom used to read me those.

270
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:39,409
"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot."

271
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:42,453
"Babbitty Rabbitty
and the Cackling Stump."

272
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:47,397
Come on, Babbitty Rabbitty.

273
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,405
No?

274
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:52,459
"To Harry James Potter...

275
00:28:52,862 --> 00:28:56,593
...I leave the Snitch he caught
in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts...

276
00:28:56,606 --> 00:29:01,634
...as a reminder
of the rewards of perseverance...

277
00:29:03,582 --> 00:29:05,777
...and skill."

278
00:29:24,926 --> 00:29:27,986
- Is that it, then?
- Not quite.

279
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:33,434
Dumbledore left you a second bequest:

280
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,430
The sword of Godric Gryffindor.

281
00:29:37,855 --> 00:29:42,451
Unfortunately, the sword of Gryffindor
was not Dumbledore's to give away.

282
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:45,385
As an important historical artifact,
it belongs--

283
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:46,531
To Harry.

284
00:29:47,294 --> 00:29:49,228
It belongs to Harry.

285
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,006
It came to him when he needed it
in the Chamber of Secrets.

286
00:29:52,062 --> 00:29:54,963
The sword may present itself
to any worthy Gryffindor.

287
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:57,338
That does not make it
that wizard's property.

288
00:29:58,623 --> 00:30:02,252
And, in any event, the current
whereabouts of the sword are unknown.

289
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,864
- Excuse me?
- The sword is missing.

290
00:30:06,078 --> 00:30:09,605
I don't know what you're up to,
Mr. Potter...

291
00:30:09,631 --> 00:30:13,590
...but you can't fight this war
on your own.

292
00:30:13,598 --> 00:30:15,998
He's too strong.

293
00:31:14,591 --> 00:31:15,853
Hello, Harry.

294
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:20,664
I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I?
I can see it growing smaller in your eyes.

295
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,195
Of course not. How are you, Luna?

296
00:31:22,302 --> 00:31:24,930
Very well. Got bitten by a garden gnome
only moments ago.

297
00:31:24,991 --> 00:31:27,323
Gnome saliva is very beneficial.

298
00:31:27,391 --> 00:31:29,757
Xenophilius Lovegood.
We live just over the hill.

299
00:31:29,823 --> 00:31:31,017
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

300
00:31:31,135 --> 00:31:33,899
I trust you know, Mr. Potter,
that we at The Quibbler...

301
00:31:33,951 --> 00:31:36,283
...unlike those toadies
at The Daily Prophet...

302
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,944
...fully supported Dumbledore
in his lifetime...

303
00:31:39,007 --> 00:31:42,670
...and, in his death,
support you just as fully.

304
00:31:42,814 --> 00:31:44,179
Thank you.

305
00:31:44,287 --> 00:31:47,120
Come, Daddy.
Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.

306
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:49,465
He's just too polite to say so.

307
00:31:49,534 --> 00:31:51,593
Harry Potter.

308
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:57,038
Excuse me, sir? May I sit down?

309
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:00,520
Mr. Potter. By all means. Here.

310
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,204
Thanks.

311
00:32:04,735 --> 00:32:08,034
I found what you wrote
in The Daily Prophet really moving.

312
00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:11,245
You obviously knew Dumbledore well.

313
00:32:11,295 --> 00:32:14,230
Well, I certainly knew him the longest.

314
00:32:14,271 --> 00:32:17,001
That is, if you don't count his brother,
Aberforth...

315
00:32:17,055 --> 00:32:20,081
...and somehow, people never do
seem to count Aberforth.

316
00:32:20,287 --> 00:32:22,346
- I didn't even know he had a brother.
- Ah.

317
00:32:22,431 --> 00:32:25,992
Well, Dumbledore was always
very private, even as a boy.

318
00:32:26,015 --> 00:32:27,414
Don't despair, Elphias.

319
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,956
I'm told he's been thoroughly
unriddled by Rita Skeeter...

320
00:32:31,935 --> 00:32:34,768
...in 800 pages, no less.

321
00:32:35,263 --> 00:32:39,666
Word has it that someone talked to her.

322
00:32:39,647 --> 00:32:42,445
Someone who knew
the Dumbledore family well.

323
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:46,314
Both you and I know who that is,
Elphias.

324
00:32:46,335 --> 00:32:47,802
A monstrous betrayal.

325
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,159
Who are we talking about?

326
00:32:52,511 --> 00:32:54,638
Bathilda Bagshot.

327
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,217
- Who?
- My God, boy...

328
00:32:57,343 --> 00:33:02,110
...she's only the most celebrated
magical historian of the last century.

329
00:33:03,552 --> 00:33:07,784
She was as close
to the Dumbledores as anyone.

330
00:33:07,775 --> 00:33:12,803
Oh, I'm sure Rita Skeeter thought
it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow...

331
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:15,964
...to take a peek
into that old bird's rattled cage.

332
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:17,830
Godric's Hollow?

333
00:33:18,175 --> 00:33:20,075
Bathilda Bagshot
lives at Godric's Hollow?

334
00:33:20,383 --> 00:33:22,476
Well, that's where
she first met Dumbledore.

335
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,424
You don't mean to say
he lived there too?

336
00:33:24,512 --> 00:33:28,073
The family moved there
after his father killed those three Muggles.

337
00:33:28,096 --> 00:33:31,725
Oh, it was quite the scandal.

338
00:33:31,744 --> 00:33:36,579
Honestly, my boy,
are you sure you knew him at all?

339
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,854
The Ministry has fallen.

340
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:09,246
The Minister of Magic is dead.

341
00:34:11,456 --> 00:34:13,754
They are coming.

342
00:34:13,824 --> 00:34:15,917
They are coming.

343
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,546
They are coming.

344
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,123
They're coming!

345
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:23,847
Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter.

346
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,766
- Ginny!
- Harry! Go!

347
00:34:36,831 --> 00:34:37,889
Go!

348
00:34:50,623 --> 00:34:53,217
Here you go, sightseeing tour?
Leaves in 15 minutes.

349
00:34:54,496 --> 00:34:57,124
- Where are we?
- Shaftesbury Avenue.

350
00:34:57,184 --> 00:35:00,381
I used to come to the theater here
with Mom and Dad.

351
00:35:00,544 --> 00:35:03,638
I don't know why I thought of it.
It just popped into my head.

352
00:35:03,904 --> 00:35:05,735
This way.

353
00:35:09,312 --> 00:35:11,405
We need to change.

354
00:35:17,024 --> 00:35:18,286
How the ruddy...?

355
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,960
Undetectable Extension Charm.

356
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,544
You're amazing, you are.

357
00:35:23,648 --> 00:35:26,208
Always the tone of surprise.

358
00:35:28,032 --> 00:35:30,159
Ah. That'll be the books.

359
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,225
What about all the people
at the wedding?

360
00:35:37,312 --> 00:35:39,780
- Do you think we should go back?
- They were after you.

361
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,001
We'd put everyone in danger
by going back.

362
00:35:43,712 --> 00:35:45,441
- Ron's right.
- Ahem.

363
00:35:45,537 --> 00:35:47,198
Coffee?

364
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:50,674
- A cappuccino, please.
- You?

365
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,659
- What she said.
- Same.

366
00:35:57,761 --> 00:36:01,595
So where do we go from here?
Leaky Cauldron?

367
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:02,884
It's too dangerous.

368
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:07,239
If Voldemort has taken over the Ministry,
none of the old places are safe.

369
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:10,325
Everyone from the wedding
will have gone underground, into hiding.

370
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,859
My rucksack with all my things,
I've left it at the Burrow.

371
00:36:17,696 --> 00:36:19,596
You're joking.

372
00:36:21,057 --> 00:36:25,016
I've had all the essentials packed
for days, just in case.

373
00:36:25,024 --> 00:36:27,219
By the way, these jeans, not my favorite.

374
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:29,314
Down!

375
00:36:30,368 --> 00:36:31,665
Stupefy!

376
00:36:35,649 --> 00:36:37,378
Expulso!

377
00:36:46,817 --> 00:36:48,648
Petrificus Totalus.

378
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:53,602
Go.

379
00:36:53,985 --> 00:36:55,145
Leave.

380
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,382
Lock the door, get the lights.

381
00:37:11,136 --> 00:37:12,865
This one's name is Rowle.

382
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:16,717
He was on the Astronomy Tower
the night Snape killed Dumbledore.

383
00:37:17,345 --> 00:37:21,839
This is Dolohov. I recognize him
from the wanted posters.

384
00:37:22,689 --> 00:37:24,850
So, what we gonna do with you, hey?

385
00:37:25,601 --> 00:37:27,694
Kill us if it was turned round,
wouldn't you?

386
00:37:27,777 --> 00:37:29,108
If we kill them, they'll know we were here.

387
00:37:29,217 --> 00:37:30,616
Ron.

388
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:34,680
Suppose he did Mad-Eye.
How would you feel then?

389
00:37:36,417 --> 00:37:38,044
It's better we wipe their memories.

390
00:37:38,817 --> 00:37:40,785
You're the boss.

391
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:42,756
Hermione...

392
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:47,525
...you're the best at spells.

393
00:38:04,353 --> 00:38:06,548
Obliviate.

394
00:38:18,305 --> 00:38:19,897
How is it they knew we were there?

395
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:21,593
Maybe you still have the Trace on you?

396
00:38:21,697 --> 00:38:25,133
Can't be. Trace breaks at 17.
It's wizarding law.

397
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:28,280
What?

398
00:38:28,993 --> 00:38:31,962
We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry.

399
00:38:32,193 --> 00:38:35,458
Ginny and I, we prepared a cake.

400
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:38,458
We were going to bring it out
at the end of the wedding.

401
00:38:38,497 --> 00:38:41,933
I appreciate the thought, but given the fact
that we were almost killed...

402
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:44,353
...by a couple of Death Eaters
a few minutes ago....

403
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,552
Right.

404
00:38:48,257 --> 00:38:49,281
Perspective.

405
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:52,401
We need to get off the streets,
get somewhere safe.

406
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:26,058
What was that all about?

407
00:39:26,913 --> 00:39:32,749
Probably Mad-Eye's idea,
in case Snape decided to come snooping.

408
00:39:40,353 --> 00:39:42,321
Homenum Revelio.

409
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,441
We're alone.

410
00:39:56,898 --> 00:39:59,128
I believed another wand--

411
00:39:59,201 --> 00:40:01,669
- You lied to me.
- It makes no sense.

412
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:07,258
I believed a different wand would work,
I swear.

413
00:40:08,578 --> 00:40:10,637
There must be another way.

414
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:21,749
Harry? Hermione, where are you?

415
00:41:21,858 --> 00:41:24,190
I think I've found something.

416
00:41:30,146 --> 00:41:31,204
Lovely.

417
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:40,102
"Regulus Arcturus Black."

418
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,825
R.A.B.

419
00:41:45,218 --> 00:41:48,517
"I know I will be dead
long before you read this.

420
00:41:48,546 --> 00:41:52,573
I have stolen the real Horcrux
and intend to destroy it."

421
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:55,170
R.A.B. is Sirius's brother.

422
00:41:55,491 --> 00:41:57,254
Yes.

423
00:41:59,202 --> 00:42:03,070
Question is,
did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?

424
00:42:23,746 --> 00:42:25,907
You've been spying on us, have you?

425
00:42:25,986 --> 00:42:30,446
Kreacher has been watching.

426
00:42:30,434 --> 00:42:32,368
Maybe he knows where the real locket is.

427
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:37,104
Have you ever seen this before?

428
00:42:37,186 --> 00:42:38,778
Kreacher?

429
00:42:39,522 --> 00:42:41,956
It's Master Regulus' locket.

430
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:44,715
But there were two, weren't there?

431
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,265
Where's the other one?

432
00:42:49,603 --> 00:42:54,165
Kreacher doesn't know
where the other locket is.

433
00:42:54,147 --> 00:42:56,547
Yes, but did you ever see it?
Was it in this house?

434
00:42:56,611 --> 00:42:57,771
Filthy Mudblood.

435
00:42:57,891 --> 00:42:59,586
- Death Eaters are coming--
- Ron.

436
00:42:59,682 --> 00:43:02,515
- Blood traitor, Weasley.
- Answer her.

437
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:06,329
Yes.

438
00:43:07,235 --> 00:43:10,693
It was here in this house.

439
00:43:11,779 --> 00:43:14,111
A most evil object.

440
00:43:14,178 --> 00:43:15,406
How do you mean?

441
00:43:16,098 --> 00:43:20,398
Before Master Regulus died,
he ordered Kreacher to destroy it...

442
00:43:20,386 --> 00:43:25,653
...but no matter how hard Kreacher tried,
he could not do it.

443
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,195
Well, where is it now?

444
00:43:27,747 --> 00:43:32,343
- Did someone take it?
- He came in the night.

445
00:43:32,323 --> 00:43:36,987
He took many things,
including the locket.

446
00:43:36,962 --> 00:43:38,486
Who did?

447
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,667
Who was it, Kreacher?

448
00:43:43,043 --> 00:43:45,705
Mundungus.

449
00:43:45,763 --> 00:43:49,255
Mundungus Fletcher.

450
00:43:50,146 --> 00:43:51,738
Find him.

451
00:44:12,323 --> 00:44:13,790
My father will hear about this.

452
00:44:18,819 --> 00:44:20,684
Hey, losers.

453
00:44:21,315 --> 00:44:23,579
He isn't here.

454
00:44:36,547 --> 00:44:38,947
As your new Minister for Magic...

455
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:44,208
...I promise to restore
this temple of tolerance...

456
00:44:44,163 --> 00:44:45,824
...to its former glory.

457
00:44:47,107 --> 00:44:48,938
Therefore, beginning today...

458
00:44:49,891 --> 00:44:53,657
...each employee
will submit themselves...

459
00:44:54,147 --> 00:44:56,377
...for evaluation.

460
00:44:57,123 --> 00:45:00,115
You have nothing to fear...

461
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,109
...if you have nothing to hide.

462
00:45:07,267 --> 00:45:08,859
- How much?
- Two Galleons.

463
00:45:08,964 --> 00:45:11,455
Come on, time is money. Cheers, pal.

464
00:45:11,523 --> 00:45:13,457
- Snatchers!
- Move out of the way.

465
00:45:19,331 --> 00:45:20,798
- I told you.
- Get out.

466
00:45:20,899 --> 00:45:21,923
Squash him.

467
00:45:30,724 --> 00:45:32,351
Be a bit gentler.

468
00:45:57,316 --> 00:45:59,443
They have flesh memories.

469
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:06,940
When Scrimgeour first gave it to you,
I thought it might open at your touch.

470
00:46:07,524 --> 00:46:10,288
That Dumbledore had hidden
something inside it.

471
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:12,065
Many of you are wondering...

472
00:46:12,164 --> 00:46:15,099
...why Voldemort has yet to show himself
now that he has vanquished...

473
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,200
...the most powerful symbol of opposition
to him and his followers.

474
00:46:20,036 --> 00:46:21,060
Get off.

475
00:46:21,188 --> 00:46:23,952
Harry Potter, so long it's been.

476
00:46:24,292 --> 00:46:25,623
Get off me.

477
00:46:30,948 --> 00:46:34,884
As requested,
Kreacher has returned with the thief...

478
00:46:34,884 --> 00:46:36,875
- Expelliarmus.
- ...Mundungus Fletcher.

479
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:40,161
What you playing at? Setting a pair
of bleeding house-elves after me.

480
00:46:40,196 --> 00:46:41,686
Dobby was only trying to help.

481
00:46:41,796 --> 00:46:46,165
Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley,
which Dobby thought was curious.

482
00:46:46,148 --> 00:46:50,482
And then Dobby heard Kreacher
mention Harry Potter's name.

483
00:46:50,468 --> 00:46:53,301
- I just--
- And then Dobby saw Kreacher...

484
00:46:53,348 --> 00:46:56,146
- ...talking with the thief, Mundungus--
- I'm no thief.

485
00:46:56,196 --> 00:46:59,131
You foul little-- Git.

486
00:46:59,396 --> 00:47:03,799
I'm a purveyor
of rare and wondrous objects.

487
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,645
You're a thief, Dung. Everyone knows it.

488
00:47:05,731 --> 00:47:08,700
Master Weasley,
so good to see you again.

489
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:09,764
Wicked trainers.

490
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:14,160
Listen, I panicked that night, all right?

491
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,850
Could I help it
if Mad-Eye fell off his broom?

492
00:47:19,684 --> 00:47:21,117
- You....
- Tell the truth.

493
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,984
When you turned this place over--
Don't deny it.

494
00:47:24,036 --> 00:47:25,560
--you found a locket, am I right?

495
00:47:25,668 --> 00:47:27,932
Why? Was it valuable?

496
00:47:28,004 --> 00:47:29,130
You still got it?

497
00:47:29,252 --> 00:47:31,686
No, he's worried
he didn't get enough money for it.

498
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,272
Bleeding give it away, didn't I?

499
00:47:34,532 --> 00:47:37,660
There I was,
flogging me wares in Diagon Alley...

500
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:41,659
...when some Ministry hag comes up
and asks to see me license.

501
00:47:41,732 --> 00:47:43,791
Says she's a mind to lock me up.

502
00:47:43,877 --> 00:47:47,540
And would've done it too,
if she hadn't taken a fancy to that locket.

503
00:47:47,556 --> 00:47:51,492
- Who was she? The witch. Do you know?
- No, I--

504
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:59,341
Well, she's there. Look.

505
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,619
Bleeding bow and all.

506
00:48:42,692 --> 00:48:46,458
Right, remember what we said.

507
00:48:46,565 --> 00:48:50,296
Don't speak to anyone
unless absolutely necessary.

508
00:48:50,405 --> 00:48:55,308
Just try and act normal.
Do what everybody else is doing.

509
00:48:55,525 --> 00:48:58,653
If we do that, then with a bit of luck,
we'll get inside.

510
00:48:58,693 --> 00:49:00,285
- And then--
- It gets really tricky.

511
00:49:00,388 --> 00:49:02,253
- Correct.
- Yeah.

512
00:49:02,341 --> 00:49:05,242
- This is completely mental.
- Completely.

513
00:49:05,284 --> 00:49:07,309
The world's mental.

514
00:49:07,397 --> 00:49:08,830
Come on...

515
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:11,783
...we've got a Horcrux to find.

516
00:50:03,365 --> 00:50:05,765
We flush ourselves in.

517
00:50:09,541 --> 00:50:12,305
That's bloody disgusting.

518
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,738
Name?

519
00:50:41,925 --> 00:50:43,449
You. Come.

520
00:50:43,557 --> 00:50:45,718
- What? What?
- Come on.

521
00:50:45,797 --> 00:50:48,231
- What did I do?
- Just keep walking.

522
00:50:55,205 --> 00:50:57,139
- Are those--?
- Muggles.

523
00:50:57,221 --> 00:51:01,817
In their rightful place.

524
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:06,530
Gotta tell you,
I'm starting to freak out a bit.

525
00:51:08,581 --> 00:51:13,075
How long did you say this batch
of Polyjuice would last, Hermione?

526
00:51:13,413 --> 00:51:14,437
I didn't.

527
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,220
Cattermole.

528
00:51:24,133 --> 00:51:27,728
It's still raining inside my office.
That's two days now.

529
00:51:29,445 --> 00:51:31,208
Have you tried an umbrella?

530
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:35,004
You do realize I'm going downstairs,
don't you, Cattermole?

531
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:39,389
- Downstairs?
- To interrogate your wife.

532
00:51:40,101 --> 00:51:44,037
Now, if my wife's blood status
were in doubt...

533
00:51:44,037 --> 00:51:46,938
...and the head of the Department
of Magical Law Enforcement...

534
00:51:46,981 --> 00:51:52,544
...needed a job doing,
I think I might just make that a priority.

535
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:55,065
You have one hour.

536
00:52:06,246 --> 00:52:11,912
Oh, my God. What am I gonna do?
My wife's all alone downstairs.

537
00:52:11,973 --> 00:52:16,239
- Ron, you don't have a wife.
- Oh, right.

538
00:52:16,229 --> 00:52:18,197
Level 2.

539
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:21,013
But how do I stop it raining?

540
00:52:21,094 --> 00:52:23,688
Try "Finite Incantatem."

541
00:52:23,749 --> 00:52:25,614
Department of Magical Law Enforcement...

542
00:52:25,702 --> 00:52:27,135
...and Improper Use of Magic Department.

543
00:52:27,237 --> 00:52:29,205
This is you, Ron.

544
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:38,025
Finite Incantatem. Okay.
And if that doesn't work...?

545
00:52:49,254 --> 00:52:52,189
Level 1,
Minister of Magic and support staff.

546
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:54,357
If we don't locate Umbridge
within the hour...

547
00:52:54,438 --> 00:52:56,429
...we go find Ron
and come back another day.

548
00:52:56,518 --> 00:52:57,542
- Deal?
- Yes.

549
00:53:00,933 --> 00:53:03,265
Ah, Mafalda. Travers sent you, did he?

550
00:53:03,334 --> 00:53:06,394
Good, we'll go straight down.

551
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,043
Albert, aren't you getting out?

552
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:44,975
Runcorn.

553
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:36,637
Accio locket.

554
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:32,193
All right, all right.
Let's calm down, shall we?

555
00:55:32,935 --> 00:55:35,403
Let's get back to work, please.

556
00:55:36,071 --> 00:55:37,902
Calm down.

557
00:55:42,951 --> 00:55:44,646
Runcorn.

558
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:53,833
Morning.

559
00:55:55,399 --> 00:55:57,833
Ron, it's me.

560
00:55:57,895 --> 00:56:01,729
Harry.
Blimey, forgot what you looked like.

561
00:56:01,735 --> 00:56:03,168
Where's Hermione?

562
00:56:03,271 --> 00:56:06,707
She's gone down to the courtrooms,
with Umbridge.

563
00:56:13,127 --> 00:56:15,254
Bloody cold down here.

564
00:56:15,335 --> 00:56:18,930
I'm a half-blood. My father was a wizard.

565
00:56:18,951 --> 00:56:21,283
William Alderton.
He worked here for 30 years.

566
00:56:21,351 --> 00:56:24,787
Perhaps you know him.
Always wore his jacket inside out.

567
00:56:24,807 --> 00:56:27,275
No, there's been a mistake.
I'm half-blood, you see.

568
00:56:27,335 --> 00:56:30,532
We must go back. I'm half-blood.

569
00:56:40,103 --> 00:56:42,196
- Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?
- Yes.

570
00:56:42,279 --> 00:56:47,216
Of 27 Chislehurst Gardens,
Great Tolling, Evesham?

571
00:56:47,175 --> 00:56:48,199
- Yes.
- It's here.

572
00:56:48,327 --> 00:56:53,128
Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred?
Wife to Reginald?

573
00:56:56,967 --> 00:56:58,025
Reg?

574
00:57:09,095 --> 00:57:10,926
Thank you, Albert.

575
00:57:13,352 --> 00:57:16,082
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?

576
00:57:18,087 --> 00:57:19,145
Yes.

577
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:23,630
A wand was taken from you
upon your arrival at the Ministry today.

578
00:57:23,656 --> 00:57:26,420
Is this that wand?

579
00:57:28,071 --> 00:57:32,599
Would you please tell the court from
which witch or wizard you took this wand?

580
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:35,017
I didn't take it.

581
00:57:36,103 --> 00:57:41,905
I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivander's,
when I was 11.

582
00:57:43,047 --> 00:57:45,538
It chose me.

583
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,523
You're lying.

584
00:57:48,872 --> 00:57:53,434
Wands only choose witches,
and you are not a witch.

585
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:55,441
But I am.

586
00:57:55,784 --> 00:57:58,844
Tell them, Reg. Tell them what I am.

587
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,525
Reg, tell them what I am.

588
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:13,802
What on earth are you doing, Albert?

589
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,420
You're lying, Dolores.

590
00:58:20,615 --> 00:58:23,175
And one mustn't tell lies.

591
00:58:23,848 --> 00:58:25,145
Stupefy!

592
00:58:32,488 --> 00:58:33,853
It's Harry Potter.

593
00:58:33,959 --> 00:58:36,427
It is, isn't it?
This'll be one to tell the kids.

594
00:58:51,688 --> 00:58:52,848
Expecto Patronum!

595
00:59:15,688 --> 00:59:18,122
Oh. Oh. Oh.

596
00:59:18,184 --> 00:59:20,209
Mary, go home.

597
00:59:21,512 --> 00:59:22,979
Get the kids.

598
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,447
I'll meet you there. We have to get out
of the country, understand?

599
00:59:26,472 --> 00:59:28,940
Mary, do as I say.

600
00:59:42,664 --> 00:59:43,824
Mary?

601
00:59:45,352 --> 00:59:47,252
Who's that?

602
00:59:48,264 --> 00:59:51,256
Long story. Nice meeting you.

603
00:59:51,305 --> 00:59:52,670
It's Harry Potter.

604
00:59:53,288 --> 00:59:55,256
It's Harry. Harry Potter.

605
00:59:55,336 --> 00:59:57,361
- There he is.
- Get him!

606
00:59:57,448 --> 00:59:59,541
- Get him!
- Stop him!

607
01:00:10,888 --> 01:00:12,048
- Watch out.
- Look out.

608
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,759
This way!

609
01:00:31,912 --> 01:00:33,743
Expelliarmus!

610
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:20,234
Oh, my God.

611
01:01:20,361 --> 01:01:23,990
Shh, shh, shh. It's all right. It's okay.

612
01:01:26,152 --> 01:01:29,417
Harry. Harry, quickly, in my bag.

613
01:01:29,449 --> 01:01:31,974
There's a bottle labeled
"Essence of Dittany."

614
01:01:34,344 --> 01:01:37,142
Shh. Shh.

615
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,889
Okay, okay. Quickly.

616
01:01:40,521 --> 01:01:42,614
- Accio Dittany.
- Shh.

617
01:01:42,889 --> 01:01:45,619
It's all right. Unstopper it.

618
01:01:45,673 --> 01:01:47,163
Hermione, his arm.

619
01:01:47,272 --> 01:01:49,263
I know, just do it.

620
01:01:49,896 --> 01:01:51,625
It's okay.

621
01:01:52,776 --> 01:01:56,735
- Okay, it's gonna sting a little bit.
- What happened? I thought we meant...

622
01:01:56,745 --> 01:01:59,475
- ...to be going back to Grimmauld Place.
- We were. We were. Shh.

623
01:01:59,529 --> 01:02:01,360
It's all right. One more, one more.

624
01:02:01,449 --> 01:02:05,977
We were there, we were there,
but Yaxley had hold of me, and I....

625
01:02:05,961 --> 01:02:08,987
I knew once he'd seen where we were,
we couldn't stay...

626
01:02:09,033 --> 01:02:12,161
...so I brought us here...

627
01:02:12,489 --> 01:02:15,117
...but Ron got splinched.

628
01:02:17,961 --> 01:02:19,758
It's all right.

629
01:02:37,961 --> 01:02:40,327
Protego Totalum.

630
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:43,108
Salvio Hexia.

631
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:44,608
What are you doing?

632
01:02:44,714 --> 01:02:47,012
Protective enchantments.

633
01:02:47,081 --> 01:02:50,676
I don't fancy another visit like the one
we had in Shaftesbury Avenue, do you?

634
01:02:50,697 --> 01:02:52,392
You can get going on the tent.

635
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:54,800
- Tent?
- Protego Totalum.

636
01:02:54,889 --> 01:02:57,016
Where am I supposed to find a tent?

637
01:02:57,097 --> 01:03:01,397
Repello Muggletum. Muffliato.

638
01:03:11,113 --> 01:03:13,013
You first.

639
01:03:15,817 --> 01:03:17,910
Dissendium.

640
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,790
Incendio.

641
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,922
Expulso.

642
01:03:46,762 --> 01:03:48,889
Diffindo.

643
01:03:50,186 --> 01:03:51,210
Reducto.

644
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:13,587
What are you doing?

645
01:04:14,857 --> 01:04:17,621
We have to keep it safe
until we find out how to destroy it.

646
01:04:17,674 --> 01:04:20,370
Seems strange, mate.
Dumbledore sends you off...

647
01:04:20,425 --> 01:04:24,191
...to find all these Horcruxes,
but doesn't tell you how to destroy them.

648
01:04:24,202 --> 01:04:25,829
Doesn't that bother you?

649
01:04:37,642 --> 01:04:41,043
A goblin by the name of Gornuk was killed.

650
01:04:41,066 --> 01:04:44,126
It is believed that Muggle-born
Dean Thomas and a second goblin...

651
01:04:44,169 --> 01:04:47,104
...both believed to have been traveling
with Tonks, Cresswell...

652
01:04:47,145 --> 01:04:48,669
...and Gornuk, may have escaped.

653
01:04:48,778 --> 01:04:52,544
If Dean is listening or anyone has
any knowledge of his whereabouts...

654
01:04:52,553 --> 01:04:55,613
...his parents and sisters
are desperate for news.

655
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:59,025
Meanwhile, a Muggle family of five
has been found dead in their home.

656
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:02,315
You know the spell, Harry.

657
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:07,032
Tell me.

658
01:05:09,514 --> 01:05:11,345
Tell me, Gregorovitch.

659
01:05:11,434 --> 01:05:13,061
It was stolen from me.

660
01:05:13,162 --> 01:05:16,620
Who was he? The thief?

661
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:23,457
It was a boy. It was he who took it.

662
01:05:23,658 --> 01:05:25,956
I never saw it again.

663
01:05:26,026 --> 01:05:27,823
I swear on my life.

664
01:05:28,586 --> 01:05:29,746
I believe you.

665
01:05:35,466 --> 01:05:37,195
Avada Kedavra!

666
01:05:51,178 --> 01:05:52,668
I thought it had stopped.

667
01:05:54,443 --> 01:05:56,877
You can't keep letting him in, Harry.

668
01:05:58,762 --> 01:06:01,697
You-Know-Who has found Gregorovitch.

669
01:06:01,867 --> 01:06:03,425
The wandmaker?

670
01:06:03,531 --> 01:06:08,059
He wants something
that Gregorovitch used to have...

671
01:06:08,042 --> 01:06:09,509
...but I don't know what.

672
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:15,606
But he wants it desperately.
I mean, it's as if his life depends on it.

673
01:06:16,842 --> 01:06:18,366
Don't.

674
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:20,669
- It comforts him.
- It sets my teeth on edge.

675
01:06:20,746 --> 01:06:22,976
What's he expecting to hear,
good news?

676
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:25,917
--who long expected it,
the fall of the Ministry was shocking.

677
01:06:25,963 --> 01:06:28,329
I think he just hopes
he doesn't hear bad news.

678
01:06:28,395 --> 01:06:30,329
We promise
to remain your eyes and ears--

679
01:06:30,411 --> 01:06:31,844
How long before he can travel?

680
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:35,143
--bringing you news when we can,
from wherever we can.

681
01:06:35,178 --> 01:06:36,475
I'm doing everything I can.

682
01:06:36,586 --> 01:06:38,110
You're not doing enough!

683
01:06:40,682 --> 01:06:42,707
Take it off.

684
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:45,930
I said, take it off now.

685
01:06:56,394 --> 01:06:59,124
- Better?
- Loads.

686
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:04,834
We'll take it in turns, okay?

687
01:07:32,618 --> 01:07:35,985
Finch does admit
his invention currently has one short.

688
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,477
And now, other news:

689
01:07:37,578 --> 01:07:40,843
Severus Snape, newly-appointed
headmaster of Hogwarts...

690
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:44,641
...has decreed that all students
must conform to the latest house rules.

691
01:08:10,987 --> 01:08:15,424
Hogwarts bears little resemblance to the
school under Dumbledore's leadership.

692
01:08:15,403 --> 01:08:19,032
Snape's curriculum is severe,
reflecting the wishes of the Dark Lord...

693
01:08:19,691 --> 01:08:24,628
...and infractions are dealt with harshly
by the two Death Eaters on staff.

694
01:08:43,115 --> 01:08:44,446
What's that?

695
01:08:53,291 --> 01:08:56,055
What's that smell?

696
01:09:17,483 --> 01:09:19,508
- What you doing?
- It's heavy.

697
01:09:19,595 --> 01:09:21,187
Oh, sorry. Do you want me to carry it?

698
01:09:21,292 --> 01:09:24,227
- Yeah, thank you.
- Don't be ridiculous. Pick it up.

699
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:26,635
Numpty.

700
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,491
Snatchers.

701
01:09:34,411 --> 01:09:36,845
Good to know your enchantments work.

702
01:09:41,579 --> 01:09:45,208
He could smell it. My perfume.

703
01:09:47,179 --> 01:09:49,238
I've told you...

704
01:09:49,611 --> 01:09:51,442
...Ron isn't strong enough to Apparate.

705
01:09:51,531 --> 01:09:55,262
Well, then, we'll go on foot.

706
01:09:55,883 --> 01:10:00,820
And next time, Hermione, as much as
I like your perfume, just don't wear any.

707
01:10:05,323 --> 01:10:09,191
And now for the names
of missing witches and wizards.

708
01:10:09,867 --> 01:10:12,028
These are confirmed.

709
01:10:12,747 --> 01:10:16,114
Thankfully, the list is short today.

710
01:10:16,683 --> 01:10:18,742
Jason and Alison Denbright.

711
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:20,524
Oh. Thank you.

712
01:10:20,652 --> 01:10:24,383
Bella, Jake, Charlie, and Madge Farley.

713
01:10:24,556 --> 01:10:25,580
Joe Laurie.

714
01:10:26,795 --> 01:10:29,389
Eleanor Sarah Gibbs.

715
01:10:30,412 --> 01:10:33,711
Harry and Bronwyn Trigg.

716
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:38,174
Rob and Ellie Dowson.

717
01:10:39,115 --> 01:10:41,640
Georgia Clark-Day.

718
01:10:42,092 --> 01:10:44,617
Joshua Flexson.

719
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:46,398
George Coutas.

720
01:10:47,436 --> 01:10:50,269
Gabriella and Emily Mather.

721
01:10:51,148 --> 01:10:54,242
Jacob and Mimi Erland.

722
01:10:55,148 --> 01:10:56,638
William and Brian Gallagher.

723
01:10:56,747 --> 01:10:59,181
He doesn't know
what he's doing, does he?

724
01:11:01,803 --> 01:11:03,703
None of us do.

725
01:11:06,092 --> 01:11:08,856
Toby and Olivia Gleaves.

726
01:11:09,579 --> 01:11:12,207
Katie and James Killick.

727
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:14,793
Elsie Valentine Schroeder.

728
01:11:15,692 --> 01:11:17,785
Jennifer Winston.

729
01:11:17,868 --> 01:11:20,962
Tamsin and lola Hillicker.

730
01:11:21,996 --> 01:11:23,020
Scarlet and Kitty Sharp.

731
01:11:41,247 --> 01:11:43,078
Oh, my God.

732
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,987
What?

733
01:11:45,472 --> 01:11:47,497
I'll tell you in a minute.

734
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:50,632
Maybe you could tell me now.

735
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,906
The sword of Gryffindor,
it's goblin-made.

736
01:11:53,952 --> 01:11:55,044
Brilliant.

737
01:11:56,032 --> 01:11:58,432
No, you don't understand.

738
01:11:58,656 --> 01:12:01,022
Dirt and rust have no effect
on the blade.

739
01:12:01,888 --> 01:12:05,255
It only takes in
that which makes it stronger.

740
01:12:05,503 --> 01:12:06,868
Okay.

741
01:12:06,975 --> 01:12:10,467
Harry, you've already destroyed
one Horcrux, right?

742
01:12:10,496 --> 01:12:12,760
Tom Riddle's diary
in the Chamber of Secrets.

743
01:12:12,831 --> 01:12:15,732
With a Basilisk fang.
If you tell me you've got one of those...

744
01:12:15,776 --> 01:12:19,234
- ...in that bloody beaded bag of yours....
- Don't you see?

745
01:12:19,264 --> 01:12:22,995
In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed
the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor.

746
01:12:23,008 --> 01:12:26,535
Its blade is impregnated
with Basilisk venom.

747
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,653
It only takes in
that which makes it stronger.

748
01:12:28,736 --> 01:12:31,899
- Exactly, which is why--
- It can destroy Horcruxes.

749
01:12:31,936 --> 01:12:34,200
That's why Dumbledore left it to you
in his will.

750
01:12:34,272 --> 01:12:38,675
You are brilliant, Hermione. Truly.

751
01:12:38,656 --> 01:12:42,717
Actually, I'm highly logical, which
allows me to look past extraneous detail...

752
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:45,211
...and perceive clearly
that which others overlook.

753
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,976
Yeah, there's only one problem,
of course.

754
01:12:53,024 --> 01:12:55,151
The sword was stolen.

755
01:12:56,416 --> 01:12:58,941
Yeah, I'm still here.

756
01:12:59,328 --> 01:13:03,458
But you two carry on.
Don't let me spoil the fun.

757
01:13:04,608 --> 01:13:08,601
- What's wrong?
- Wrong? Nothing's wrong.

758
01:13:08,608 --> 01:13:10,508
Not according to you, anyway.

759
01:13:10,592 --> 01:13:14,221
Look, if you've got something to say,
don't be shy. Spit it out.

760
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:17,731
All right, I'll spit it out.
But don't expect me to be grateful...

761
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,285
...because there's another damn thing
we've gotta find.

762
01:13:20,352 --> 01:13:22,616
I thought you knew
what you signed up for.

763
01:13:23,008 --> 01:13:24,873
Yeah. I thought I did too.

764
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,986
Well then, I'm sorry,
but I don't quite understand.

765
01:13:28,032 --> 01:13:31,490
What part of this isn't living up
to your expectations?

766
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,784
Did you think we were gonna
be staying in a hotel?

767
01:13:33,856 --> 01:13:37,121
Finding a Horcrux every other day?
Thought you'd be back by Christmas?

768
01:13:37,152 --> 01:13:38,983
I just thought, after all this time...

769
01:13:39,072 --> 01:13:42,508
...we would've achieved something.
I thought you knew what you were doing.

770
01:13:42,528 --> 01:13:44,928
I thought Dumbledore told you
something worthwhile.

771
01:13:44,992 --> 01:13:48,189
- I thought you had a plan.
- I told you everything Dumbledore told me.

772
01:13:48,224 --> 01:13:50,419
In case you haven't noticed,
we found a Horcrux.

773
01:13:50,496 --> 01:13:54,364
Yeah, and we're as close to getting rid of it
as we are to finding the rest of them.

774
01:13:54,369 --> 01:13:56,963
Ron. Please, take--

775
01:13:57,376 --> 01:13:59,776
Take the Horcrux off.
You wouldn't be saying this...

776
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,171
...if you hadn't been wearing it all day.

777
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,680
Want to know why I listen to that radio?

778
01:14:03,744 --> 01:14:08,408
To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name,
or Fred, or George or Mom.

779
01:14:08,384 --> 01:14:11,547
You think I'm not listening?
You think I don't know how this feels?!

780
01:14:11,584 --> 01:14:13,051
No, you don't know how it feels!

781
01:14:13,152 --> 01:14:15,518
Your parents are dead.
You have no family.

782
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,210
- Stop. Stop.
- Fine, then go!

783
01:14:19,904 --> 01:14:21,064
Go, then!

784
01:14:23,808 --> 01:14:24,832
Fine.

785
01:14:27,809 --> 01:14:29,470
Ron.

786
01:14:32,513 --> 01:14:34,310
And you?

787
01:14:35,905 --> 01:14:38,430
Are you coming or you staying?

788
01:14:45,153 --> 01:14:48,213
Fine. I get it.

789
01:14:48,704 --> 01:14:50,672
I saw you two the other night.

790
01:14:50,976 --> 01:14:53,410
Ron, that's-- That's nothing.

791
01:14:55,361 --> 01:14:56,726
Ron--

792
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:02,077
Ron, where are you going?

793
01:15:02,944 --> 01:15:05,174
Please, come back.

794
01:15:06,496 --> 01:15:08,191
Ron.

795
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:13,665
Ron!

796
01:16:13,377 --> 01:16:16,005
Salvio Hexia.

797
01:16:19,233 --> 01:16:21,667
Repellum Muggletum.

798
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:26,947
Salvio Hexia.

799
01:16:47,297 --> 01:16:49,959
Poor old Jim's white as a ghost

800
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:53,822
He's found the answer that we lost

801
01:16:54,081 --> 01:16:57,517
We're all weeping now
Weeping because

802
01:16:57,921 --> 01:17:03,484
There ain't nothing we can do
To protect you

803
01:17:03,617 --> 01:17:07,109
O children

804
01:17:10,753 --> 01:17:14,484
Lift up your voice

805
01:17:14,497 --> 01:17:19,992
Lift up your voice

806
01:17:19,937 --> 01:17:22,167
Children

807
01:17:25,633 --> 01:17:31,367
Rejoice, rejoice

808
01:17:31,297 --> 01:17:34,698
Hey, little train, we're jumping on

809
01:17:34,722 --> 01:17:38,453
The train that goes to the kingdom

810
01:17:38,818 --> 01:17:41,981
We're happy, Ma
We're having fun

811
01:17:42,017 --> 01:17:46,147
And the train ain't even left the station

812
01:17:46,145 --> 01:17:49,512
Hey, little train, wait for me

813
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:53,404
I once was blind but now I see

814
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:56,743
Have you left a seat for me?

815
01:17:56,769 --> 01:18:00,899
Is that such a stretch of the imagination?

816
01:18:00,898 --> 01:18:04,231
Hey, little train, wait for me

817
01:18:04,258 --> 01:18:08,126
I was held in chains but now I'm free

818
01:18:08,258 --> 01:18:11,159
I'm hanging in there
Don't you see?

819
01:18:11,202 --> 01:18:15,662
In this process of elimination

820
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:18,778
Hey, little train, we're jumping on

821
01:18:18,882 --> 01:18:22,340
The train that goes to the kingdom

822
01:18:22,785 --> 01:18:26,084
We're happy, Ma
We're having fun

823
01:18:26,113 --> 01:18:30,015
It's beyond my wildest expectation

824
01:18:30,018 --> 01:18:33,249
Hey, little train, we're jumping on

825
01:18:33,282 --> 01:18:36,911
The train that goes to the kingdom

826
01:18:37,281 --> 01:18:40,478
We're happy, Ma
We're having fun

827
01:18:40,513 --> 01:18:45,382
The train ain't even left the station

828
01:19:29,986 --> 01:19:31,476
Hermione.

829
01:19:31,586 --> 01:19:33,918
Hermione? You were right.

830
01:19:33,986 --> 01:19:35,544
Snitches have flesh memories...

831
01:19:35,650 --> 01:19:40,280
...but I didn't catch the first Snitch
with my hand, I almost swallowed it.

832
01:19:45,154 --> 01:19:47,918
- "I open at the close."
- What do you think that means?

833
01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:49,369
I don't know.

834
01:19:51,618 --> 01:19:54,018
I found something as well.

835
01:20:00,035 --> 01:20:03,493
At first I thought it was an eye,
but now I don't think it is.

836
01:20:03,523 --> 01:20:07,687
It isn't a rune, and it isn't anywhere
in Spellman's Syllabary.

837
01:20:07,971 --> 01:20:11,065
Somebody inked it in.
It isn't part of the book. Somebody drew it.

838
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:14,769
Luna's dad was wearing that
at Bill and Fleur's wedding.

839
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:20,549
Why would someone draw it
in a children's book?

840
01:20:22,915 --> 01:20:25,349
Look, Hermione, I've been thinking.

841
01:20:25,795 --> 01:20:27,888
I want to go to Godric's Hollow.

842
01:20:27,971 --> 01:20:31,031
It's where I was born.
It's where my parents died.

843
01:20:31,074 --> 01:20:34,669
That's exactly where he'll expect you to go
because it means something to you.

844
01:20:34,691 --> 01:20:37,125
Yeah, but it means something to him too,
Hermione.

845
01:20:37,186 --> 01:20:39,177
You-Know-Who almost died there.

846
01:20:39,266 --> 01:20:43,930
I mean, isn't that exactly the type of place
he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux?

847
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:47,234
It's dangerous, Harry.

848
01:20:48,675 --> 01:20:52,668
But even I have to admit, recently
I've been thinking we'll have to go there.

849
01:20:52,675 --> 01:20:55,109
I think it's possible
something else is hidden there.

850
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:56,694
What?

851
01:20:57,315 --> 01:20:59,010
The sword.

852
01:20:59,491 --> 01:21:03,291
If Dumbledore wanted you to find it,
but didn't want it in the Ministry's hands...

853
01:21:03,299 --> 01:21:07,497
...where better to hide it than
the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor?

854
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:10,475
Hermione....

855
01:21:15,426 --> 01:21:18,156
Don't ever let me
give you a haircut again.

856
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:41,097
I still think we should've used
Polyjuice Potion.

857
01:21:41,155 --> 01:21:42,679
No.

858
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:45,461
This is where I was born.

859
01:21:45,699 --> 01:21:48,099
I'm not returning as someone else.

860
01:21:57,411 --> 01:22:00,403
Good night. Ha-ha-ha.

861
01:22:03,203 --> 01:22:05,967
Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve.

862
01:22:07,299 --> 01:22:08,596
Listen.

863
01:22:14,019 --> 01:22:16,852
Do you think they'd be in there,
Hermione?

864
01:22:17,155 --> 01:22:19,146
My mom and dad.

865
01:22:24,771 --> 01:22:27,035
Yeah, I think they would.

866
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:05,079
"Ignotus Peverell."

867
01:23:06,947 --> 01:23:08,574
Hey, Harry?

868
01:23:44,835 --> 01:23:47,030
Merry Christmas, Hermione.

869
01:23:48,196 --> 01:23:50,426
Merry Christmas, Harry.

870
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:14,784
Harry, there's someone
watching us. By the church.

871
01:24:24,836 --> 01:24:26,667
I think I know who that is.

872
01:24:28,387 --> 01:24:29,820
I don't like this, Harry.

873
01:24:29,924 --> 01:24:34,952
Hermione, she knew
Dumbledore. She might have the sword.

874
01:24:52,836 --> 01:24:54,463
This is where they died, Hermione.

875
01:25:01,668 --> 01:25:04,136
This is where he murdered them.

876
01:25:16,036 --> 01:25:17,970
You're Bathilda, aren't you?

877
01:25:23,268 --> 01:25:25,361
Here, let me do that.

878
01:25:48,421 --> 01:25:52,323
Miss Bagshot, who is this man?

879
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:04,961
Harry.

880
01:26:08,773 --> 01:26:10,638
Lumos.

881
01:27:46,821 --> 01:27:47,845
Harry!

882
01:28:36,549 --> 01:28:37,607
Confringo!

883
01:29:18,565 --> 01:29:20,692
Are you feeling better?

884
01:29:23,558 --> 01:29:26,026
You've outdone yourself this time,
Hermione.

885
01:29:26,086 --> 01:29:28,179
The Forest of Dean.

886
01:29:29,029 --> 01:29:33,398
I came here once with Mom and Dad,
years ago.

887
01:29:33,829 --> 01:29:35,956
It's just how I remember it.

888
01:29:36,261 --> 01:29:40,197
The trees, the river, everything.

889
01:29:40,326 --> 01:29:43,159
Like nothing's changed.

890
01:29:44,229 --> 01:29:47,221
Not true, of course.
Everything's changed.

891
01:29:48,037 --> 01:29:51,837
If I brought my parents back here now,
they probably wouldn't recognize any of it.

892
01:29:53,702 --> 01:29:57,832
Not the trees, not the river...

893
01:29:59,366 --> 01:30:01,493
...not even me.

894
01:30:06,342 --> 01:30:09,140
Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.

895
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:13,077
Grow old.

896
01:30:18,758 --> 01:30:22,057
You wanted to know
who the boy in the photograph was.

897
01:30:22,629 --> 01:30:23,721
I know.

898
01:30:24,805 --> 01:30:27,205
Gellert Grindelwald.

899
01:30:33,766 --> 01:30:37,167
He's the thief I saw
in Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.

900
01:30:37,189 --> 01:30:40,454
Speaking of which, where is my wand?

901
01:30:41,606 --> 01:30:44,006
Where's my wand, Hermione?

902
01:30:52,198 --> 01:30:56,692
As we were leaving Godric's Hollow,
I cast a curse and it rebounded.

903
01:30:59,142 --> 01:31:00,370
I'm sorry.

904
01:31:00,966 --> 01:31:03,594
- I tried to mend it, but wands are different.
- It's done.

905
01:31:05,382 --> 01:31:09,341
Leave me yours.
Go inside and get warm.

906
01:31:09,574 --> 01:31:11,906
I'll take the locket as well.

907
01:31:23,846 --> 01:31:25,211
Trust me.

908
01:32:47,398 --> 01:32:49,025
Lumos.

909
01:33:28,359 --> 01:33:29,724
Accio sword.

910
01:33:35,271 --> 01:33:37,171
Diffindo.

911
01:35:13,415 --> 01:35:16,578
- Hermione?
- Are you mental?

912
01:35:17,607 --> 01:35:19,165
It was you?

913
01:35:19,271 --> 01:35:23,037
Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I think.

914
01:35:23,048 --> 01:35:24,845
And you cast the doe as well, did you?

915
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:28,983
- No, I thought that was you.
- No, my Patronus is a stag.

916
01:35:28,999 --> 01:35:31,194
Right. Yeah. Antlers.

917
01:35:34,151 --> 01:35:37,314
Okay, Ron. Do it.

918
01:35:38,119 --> 01:35:41,850
I can't handle it. That thing affects me
more than it affects you and Hermione.

919
01:35:42,215 --> 01:35:44,843
- All the more reason.
- No. I can't.

920
01:35:44,903 --> 01:35:46,131
Then why are you here?

921
01:35:47,431 --> 01:35:49,490
Why did you come back?

922
01:35:56,679 --> 01:36:00,809
Now, I'll have to speak to it in order for it
to open. When it does, don't hesitate.

923
01:36:01,223 --> 01:36:03,748
I don't know what's in there,
but it'll put up a fight.

924
01:36:03,816 --> 01:36:06,512
The bit of Riddle that was in that diary
tried to kill me.

925
01:36:08,776 --> 01:36:10,403
All right.

926
01:36:11,144 --> 01:36:12,702
One...

927
01:36:13,287 --> 01:36:14,345
...two...

928
01:36:14,951 --> 01:36:16,851
...three.

929
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:31,697
I have seen your heart, and it is mine.

930
01:36:33,992 --> 01:36:37,894
I have seen your dreams,
Ronald Weasley...

931
01:36:37,895 --> 01:36:40,295
...and I have seen your fears.

932
01:36:41,831 --> 01:36:45,995
Least loved by your mother,
who craved a daughter.

933
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:51,434
Least loved by the girl
who prefers your friend.

934
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:54,130
Ron, kill it!

935
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,896
We were better without you.

936
01:37:03,272 --> 01:37:05,001
Happier without you.

937
01:37:05,096 --> 01:37:10,466
Who could look at you
compared to Harry Potter?

938
01:37:11,432 --> 01:37:14,765
What are you
compared with the Chosen One?

939
01:37:14,792 --> 01:37:15,952
Ron, it's lying!

940
01:37:16,072 --> 01:37:19,064
Your mother confessed
she would have preferred me as a son.

941
01:37:19,112 --> 01:37:22,104
What woman would take you?

942
01:37:22,184 --> 01:37:25,347
You are nothing.

943
01:37:25,384 --> 01:37:26,510
Nothing.

944
01:37:27,208 --> 01:37:31,235
Nothing compared to him.

945
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,221
Just think...

946
01:38:22,025 --> 01:38:24,118
...only three to go.

947
01:38:26,952 --> 01:38:28,681
Hermione?

948
01:38:30,792 --> 01:38:32,521
Hermione?

949
01:38:36,808 --> 01:38:38,742
Is everything all right?

950
01:38:39,272 --> 01:38:43,936
It's fine.
Actually, you know, it's more than fine.

951
01:38:48,008 --> 01:38:49,600
Hey.

952
01:38:53,608 --> 01:38:59,808
You complete ass, Ronald Weasley!

953
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:03,383
You show up here after weeks,
and you say "hey"?

954
01:39:05,353 --> 01:39:08,083
- Where's my wand? Where's my wand?
- I don't know.

955
01:39:08,137 --> 01:39:10,401
- Harry Potter, give me my wand.
- I don't have it.

956
01:39:10,473 --> 01:39:14,307
- How come he's got your wand?
- Never mind why he's got my wand.

957
01:39:16,329 --> 01:39:17,557
What is that?

958
01:39:20,329 --> 01:39:21,353
You destroyed it.

959
01:39:24,488 --> 01:39:28,447
And how is it that you just happen
to have the sword of Gryffindor?

960
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:30,648
It's a long story.

961
01:39:33,609 --> 01:39:37,705
- Don't think this changes anything.
- Oh, of course not.

962
01:39:37,705 --> 01:39:40,970
I only just destroyed a bloody Horcrux.
Why would that change anything?

963
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:45,061
Look, I wanted to come back
as soon as I left.

964
01:39:45,065 --> 01:39:48,501
- I just didn't know how to find you.
- Yeah, how did you find us?

965
01:39:48,521 --> 01:39:51,581
With this. It doesn't just turn off lights.

966
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:56,528
I don't know how it works, but Christmas
morning I was sleeping in this little pub...

967
01:39:56,489 --> 01:39:58,923
...keeping away from some Snatchers...

968
01:39:59,240 --> 01:40:00,502
...and I heard it.

969
01:40:00,841 --> 01:40:02,274
It?

970
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:05,431
A voice...

971
01:40:06,889 --> 01:40:08,083
...your voice, Hermione...

972
01:40:09,161 --> 01:40:10,788
...coming out of it.

973
01:40:10,889 --> 01:40:14,723
- And what exactly did I say, may I ask?
- My name.

974
01:40:15,145 --> 01:40:17,170
Just my name.

975
01:40:17,833 --> 01:40:19,926
Like a whisper.

976
01:40:21,737 --> 01:40:27,733
So I took it, clicked it,
and this tiny ball of light appeared.

977
01:40:27,945 --> 01:40:29,378
And I knew.

978
01:40:29,865 --> 01:40:34,495
And sure enough, it floated toward me,
the ball of light...

979
01:40:35,945 --> 01:40:40,143
...went right to my chest,
straight through me. Right here.

980
01:40:41,129 --> 01:40:45,122
And I knew it was gonna take me
where I needed to go, so I Disapparated...

981
01:40:45,129 --> 01:40:47,393
...and came to this hillside.

982
01:40:47,817 --> 01:40:50,342
It was dark. I had no idea where I was.

983
01:40:50,761 --> 01:40:53,594
I just hoped
that one of you would show yourself.

984
01:40:54,345 --> 01:40:55,869
And you did.

985
01:41:12,521 --> 01:41:15,422
I've always liked these flames
Hermione makes.

986
01:41:19,177 --> 01:41:21,737
How long do you reckon
she'll stay mad at me?

987
01:41:23,113 --> 01:41:26,446
Well, just keep talking about that
little ball of light touching your heart...

988
01:41:26,473 --> 01:41:27,906
...and she'll come round.

989
01:41:28,010 --> 01:41:30,740
It was true. Every word.

990
01:41:32,361 --> 01:41:34,727
This is gonna sound crazy...

991
01:41:35,082 --> 01:41:39,451
...but I think that's why Dumbledore
left it to me, the Deluminator.

992
01:41:39,753 --> 01:41:44,747
I think he knew that somehow I'd need it
to find my way back, and she'd lead me.

993
01:41:47,306 --> 01:41:50,036
Bloody hell, I just realized,
you need a wand, don't you?

994
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:52,581
- Yeah.
- I've got one here.

995
01:41:52,745 --> 01:41:55,339
It's a blackthorn. Ten inches.

996
01:41:55,401 --> 01:41:58,996
Nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.

997
01:41:59,274 --> 01:42:02,072
Took if off a Snatcher
a couple of weeks ago.

998
01:42:02,441 --> 01:42:06,275
Don't tell Hermione this,
but they're a bit dim, Snatchers.

999
01:42:06,377 --> 01:42:09,312
This one was definitely part troll,
the smell of him.

1000
01:42:09,353 --> 01:42:10,377
Engorgio.

1001
01:42:10,506 --> 01:42:12,667
- Reducio!
- What's going on in there?

1002
01:42:12,745 --> 01:42:14,007
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

1003
01:42:16,233 --> 01:42:17,860
We need to talk.

1004
01:42:18,570 --> 01:42:19,764
Yeah, all right.

1005
01:42:26,410 --> 01:42:29,937
- I want to go see Xenophilius Lovegood.
- Sorry?

1006
01:42:31,498 --> 01:42:33,125
See this?

1007
01:42:33,226 --> 01:42:37,094
It's a letter Dumbledore wrote
to Grindelwald. Look at the signature.

1008
01:42:38,122 --> 01:42:40,317
It's the mark again.

1009
01:42:41,129 --> 01:42:43,256
It keeps cropping up.

1010
01:42:43,338 --> 01:42:47,707
In Beedle the Bard,
in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow.

1011
01:42:48,330 --> 01:42:50,195
It was there too.

1012
01:42:50,282 --> 01:42:53,877
- Where?
- Outside Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.

1013
01:42:54,154 --> 01:42:55,382
But what does it mean?

1014
01:42:55,498 --> 01:43:00,299
Look, you've got no idea where
the next Horcrux is, and neither do I...

1015
01:43:01,738 --> 01:43:04,673
...but this, this means something.

1016
01:43:04,873 --> 01:43:08,274
- I'm sure of it.
- Yeah. Hermione's right.

1017
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:11,223
We ought to see Lovegood.

1018
01:43:11,626 --> 01:43:15,357
Let's vote on it. Those in favor?

1019
01:43:38,058 --> 01:43:40,686
You're not still mad at him, are you?

1020
01:43:40,874 --> 01:43:43,138
I'm always mad at him.

1021
01:43:45,706 --> 01:43:47,196
Luna.

1022
01:43:47,306 --> 01:43:49,001
Luna.

1023
01:43:56,298 --> 01:43:59,131
"Keep off the dirigible plums."

1024
01:44:07,690 --> 01:44:10,386
What is it? Who are you?

1025
01:44:10,570 --> 01:44:11,594
What do you want?

1026
01:44:11,722 --> 01:44:16,318
Hello, Mr. Lovegood. I'm Harry Potter.
We met a few months ago.

1027
01:44:19,978 --> 01:44:21,878
Could we come in?

1028
01:44:25,418 --> 01:44:28,012
- Where is Luna?
- Luna?

1029
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:31,098
She'll be along.

1030
01:44:43,978 --> 01:44:46,037
So how can I help you, Mr. Potter?

1031
01:44:46,763 --> 01:44:49,789
Well, actually....

1032
01:44:50,634 --> 01:44:55,162
It was about something you were wearing
round your neck at the wedding. A symbol.

1033
01:44:56,458 --> 01:44:58,358
You mean this?

1034
01:44:58,666 --> 01:45:00,258
Yes.

1035
01:45:00,490 --> 01:45:02,355
That exactly.

1036
01:45:02,922 --> 01:45:06,881
What we've wondered is, what is it?

1037
01:45:06,891 --> 01:45:08,722
What is it?

1038
01:45:08,811 --> 01:45:11,780
Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows,
of course.

1039
01:45:11,819 --> 01:45:12,911
- The what?
- The what?

1040
01:45:13,035 --> 01:45:15,094
The Deathly Hallows.

1041
01:45:15,179 --> 01:45:18,273
I assume you're all familiar with
"The Tale of the Three Brothers."

1042
01:45:18,314 --> 01:45:19,804
- Yes.
- No.

1043
01:45:24,875 --> 01:45:26,638
I have it in here.

1044
01:45:37,355 --> 01:45:38,982
"There were once three brothers...

1045
01:45:39,082 --> 01:45:43,485
...who were traveling along a lonely,
winding road at twilight."

1046
01:45:43,467 --> 01:45:46,197
Midnight. Mom always said "midnight."

1047
01:45:50,891 --> 01:45:54,759
But "twilight's" fine. Better, actually.

1048
01:45:56,779 --> 01:45:58,644
Do you want to read it?

1049
01:45:58,731 --> 01:46:00,926
No. It's fine.

1050
01:46:02,667 --> 01:46:04,601
"There were once three brothers...

1051
01:46:04,683 --> 01:46:09,882
...who were traveling along a lonely,
winding road at twilight.

1052
01:46:11,467 --> 01:46:16,769
In time, the brothers reached a river
too treacherous to pass.

1053
01:46:16,874 --> 01:46:18,739
But being learned in the magical arts...

1054
01:46:18,827 --> 01:46:23,992
...the three brothers simply
waved their wands and made a bridge.

1055
01:46:25,067 --> 01:46:27,160
Before they could cross, however...

1056
01:46:27,243 --> 01:46:31,339
...they found their path blocked
by a hooded figure.

1057
01:46:31,435 --> 01:46:35,303
It was Death, and he felt cheated.

1058
01:46:35,307 --> 01:46:38,367
Cheated because travelers would
normally drown in the river.

1059
01:46:38,411 --> 01:46:40,470
But Death was cunning.

1060
01:46:41,003 --> 01:46:43,995
He pretended to congratulate
the three brothers on their magic...

1061
01:46:44,043 --> 01:46:49,310
...and said that each had earned a prize for
having been clever enough to evade him.

1062
01:46:49,643 --> 01:46:54,205
The oldest asked for a wand
more powerful than any in existence.

1063
01:46:54,187 --> 01:46:58,783
So Death fashioned him one
from an elder tree that stood nearby.

1064
01:46:59,947 --> 01:47:04,247
The second brother decided he wanted
to humiliate Death even further...

1065
01:47:04,235 --> 01:47:08,672
...and asked for the power
to recall loved ones from the grave.

1066
01:47:08,908 --> 01:47:13,208
So Death plucked a stone from the river
and offered it to him.

1067
01:47:13,739 --> 01:47:17,698
Finally,
Death turned to the third brother.

1068
01:47:18,699 --> 01:47:20,132
A humble man...

1069
01:47:20,235 --> 01:47:24,433
...he asked for something that would
allow him to go forth from that place...

1070
01:47:24,428 --> 01:47:27,591
...without being followed by Death.

1071
01:47:28,523 --> 01:47:34,393
And so it was that Death reluctantly
handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.

1072
01:47:37,387 --> 01:47:40,322
The first brother traveled
to a distant village...

1073
01:47:40,363 --> 01:47:42,456
...where, with the Elder Wand in hand...

1074
01:47:42,539 --> 01:47:46,305
...he killed a wizard
with whom he had once quarreled.

1075
01:47:48,268 --> 01:47:51,795
Drunk with the power
that the Elder Wand had given him...

1076
01:47:51,819 --> 01:47:54,913
...he bragged of his invincibility.

1077
01:47:57,675 --> 01:48:01,133
But that night,
another wizard stole the wand...

1078
01:48:01,163 --> 01:48:04,291
...and slit the brother's throat
for good measure.

1079
01:48:04,363 --> 01:48:07,799
And so Death took the first brother
for his own.

1080
01:48:08,364 --> 01:48:10,332
The second brother journeyed
to his home...

1081
01:48:10,411 --> 01:48:13,380
...where he took the stone
and turned it thrice in hand.

1082
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:17,880
To his delight, the girl he'd once hoped
to marry before her untimely death...

1083
01:48:17,868 --> 01:48:20,234
...appeared before him.

1084
01:48:20,619 --> 01:48:25,921
Yet, soon she turned sad and cold
for she did not belong in the mortal world.

1085
01:48:25,868 --> 01:48:27,495
Driven mad with hopeless longing...

1086
01:48:27,595 --> 01:48:30,894
...the second brother killed himself
so as to join her.

1087
01:48:31,916 --> 01:48:35,010
And so Death took the second brother.

1088
01:48:35,052 --> 01:48:36,679
As for the third brother...

1089
01:48:36,780 --> 01:48:41,012
...Death searched for many years
but was never able to find him.

1090
01:48:41,004 --> 01:48:43,905
Only when he attained a great age
did the youngest brother...

1091
01:48:43,948 --> 01:48:48,214
...shed the Cloak of Invisibility
and give it to his son.

1092
01:48:49,228 --> 01:48:53,358
He then greeted Death as an old friend
and went with him gladly...

1093
01:48:53,355 --> 01:48:56,518
...departing this life as equals."

1094
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:02,874
So there you are.
Those are the Deathly Hallows.

1095
01:49:04,044 --> 01:49:07,104
I'm sorry, sir.
I still don't quite understand.

1096
01:49:12,364 --> 01:49:14,457
Where's that pen I had?

1097
01:49:24,908 --> 01:49:26,170
The Elder Wand.

1098
01:49:27,212 --> 01:49:30,875
The most powerful wand ever made.

1099
01:49:40,684 --> 01:49:42,982
The Resurrection Stone.

1100
01:49:53,325 --> 01:49:57,091
The Cloak of Invisibility.

1101
01:49:58,892 --> 01:50:02,020
Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.

1102
01:50:02,156 --> 01:50:07,617
Together, they make one
master of Death.

1103
01:50:12,396 --> 01:50:16,059
That mark was on a grave
in Godric's Hollow.

1104
01:50:16,973 --> 01:50:19,601
Uh, Mr. Lovegood,
does the Peverell Family...

1105
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:21,491
...have anything to do
with the Deathly Hallows?

1106
01:50:21,580 --> 01:50:24,413
Uh-- Uh--

1107
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:28,226
Ignotus-- Excuse me. --and his brothers,
Cadmus and Antioch...

1108
01:50:28,237 --> 01:50:30,899
...are thought to be the original owners
of the Hallows...

1109
01:50:30,957 --> 01:50:35,826
...and therefore the inspiration
for the story. Uh-- Uh--

1110
01:50:35,788 --> 01:50:38,279
But your tea's gone cold.

1111
01:50:39,341 --> 01:50:41,332
I'll be right back.

1112
01:50:41,421 --> 01:50:43,286
Let's go down here.

1113
01:50:45,005 --> 01:50:46,495
Let's get out of here.

1114
01:50:46,604 --> 01:50:49,471
I'm not drinking any more of that stuff,
hot or cold.

1115
01:50:55,405 --> 01:50:57,373
Thank you, sir.

1116
01:50:58,156 --> 01:51:01,182
- You forgot the water.
- Water?

1117
01:51:01,229 --> 01:51:02,662
For the tea.

1118
01:51:02,764 --> 01:51:05,324
Did--? Did I?

1119
01:51:07,085 --> 01:51:09,246
How silly of me.

1120
01:51:10,700 --> 01:51:12,964
It's no matter.
We really should be going anyway.

1121
01:51:13,037 --> 01:51:15,096
No, you can't!

1122
01:51:19,053 --> 01:51:20,748
Sir?

1123
01:51:27,757 --> 01:51:30,351
You're my only hope.

1124
01:51:33,965 --> 01:51:38,334
They were angry, you see,
about what I'd been writing.

1125
01:51:41,069 --> 01:51:43,196
So they took her.

1126
01:51:44,525 --> 01:51:47,289
They took my Luna.

1127
01:51:48,813 --> 01:51:50,440
My Luna.

1128
01:52:02,349 --> 01:52:05,250
But it's really you they want.

1129
01:52:07,276 --> 01:52:09,335
Who took her, sir?

1130
01:52:14,189 --> 01:52:15,451
Voldemort.

1131
01:52:25,613 --> 01:52:27,911
Stop! I've got him!

1132
01:52:44,397 --> 01:52:48,299
That treacherous little bleeder.
Is there no one we can trust?

1133
01:52:48,302 --> 01:52:50,600
They kidnapped her
because he supported me.

1134
01:52:50,669 --> 01:52:52,796
He was just desperate.

1135
01:52:53,229 --> 01:52:55,424
I'll do the enchantments.

1136
01:53:06,542 --> 01:53:07,975
Hello, beautiful.

1137
01:53:13,165 --> 01:53:16,794
Well, don't hang about, snatch them.

1138
01:54:24,973 --> 01:54:26,463
Harry.

1139
01:54:26,574 --> 01:54:29,543
Tell me, Grindelwald.
Tell me where it is.

1140
01:54:29,998 --> 01:54:34,059
Grindelwald. Grindelwald. Grindelwald.

1141
01:54:34,606 --> 01:54:38,064
Hello, Tom.
I knew you would come one day...

1142
01:54:38,382 --> 01:54:42,341
...but surely you must know
I no longer have what you seek.

1143
01:54:42,797 --> 01:54:45,823
- Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where it is.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1144
01:54:45,870 --> 01:54:47,235
Tell me who possesses it.

1145
01:54:47,374 --> 01:54:52,471
The Elder Wand lies with him,
of course...

1146
01:54:52,430 --> 01:54:54,694
...buried in the earth.

1147
01:54:55,502 --> 01:54:56,833
Dumbledore.

1148
01:55:05,454 --> 01:55:07,319
The Hallows exist...

1149
01:55:07,405 --> 01:55:11,205
...but he's only after one of them,
the last one. He knows where it is.

1150
01:55:11,214 --> 01:55:15,048
He's gonna have it by the end of the night.
You-Know-Who's found the Elder Wand.

1151
01:55:15,054 --> 01:55:17,522
- Don't touch her. Unh!
- Leave him.

1152
01:55:17,582 --> 01:55:18,844
Your boyfriend will get worse than that...

1153
01:55:18,958 --> 01:55:20,084
Get off me.

1154
01:55:20,206 --> 01:55:22,936
...if he doesn't learn to behave himself.

1155
01:55:25,934 --> 01:55:27,424
What happened to you, ugly?

1156
01:55:29,006 --> 01:55:30,871
No, not you.

1157
01:55:32,142 --> 01:55:35,202
- What's your name?
- Dudley. Vernon Dudley.

1158
01:55:35,246 --> 01:55:37,441
Check it.

1159
01:55:38,894 --> 01:55:41,226
And you, my lovely...

1160
01:55:44,302 --> 01:55:46,293
...what do they call you?

1161
01:55:47,598 --> 01:55:51,659
Penelope Clearwater, half-blood.

1162
01:55:54,478 --> 01:55:56,412
There's no Vernon Dudley on here.

1163
01:55:57,358 --> 01:56:00,589
Did you hear that, ugly?
The list says you're lying.

1164
01:56:00,622 --> 01:56:02,852
How come you don't want us
to know who you are?

1165
01:56:02,927 --> 01:56:05,589
The list's wrong. I told you who I am.

1166
01:56:20,782 --> 01:56:22,875
Change of plan.

1167
01:56:23,822 --> 01:56:27,087
We're not taking this lot to the Ministry.

1168
01:57:05,007 --> 01:57:08,636
Get Draco.

1169
01:57:12,783 --> 01:57:14,341
Well?

1170
01:57:17,262 --> 01:57:21,790
- I can't be sure.
- Draco. Look closely, son.

1171
01:57:22,574 --> 01:57:27,637
If we are the ones
to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord...

1172
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:32,832
...everything would be forgiven.
All would be as it was, you understand?

1173
01:57:32,782 --> 01:57:36,912
Now, we won't be forgetting who
actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy.

1174
01:57:36,911 --> 01:57:39,345
You dare to
talk to me like that in my own house?

1175
01:57:39,407 --> 01:57:41,204
Lucius.

1176
01:57:43,919 --> 01:57:47,753
Don't be shy, sweetie. Come over.

1177
01:57:49,038 --> 01:57:53,805
Now, if this isn't who we think it is, Draco,
and we call him, he'll kill us all.

1178
01:57:53,775 --> 01:57:56,573
We need to be absolutely sure.

1179
01:57:56,751 --> 01:57:57,740
What's wrong with his face?

1180
01:57:57,871 --> 01:57:59,600
Yes, what is wrong with his face?

1181
01:57:59,695 --> 01:58:00,889
He came to us like that.

1182
01:58:01,007 --> 01:58:02,975
Something he picked up in the forest,
I reckon.

1183
01:58:03,055 --> 01:58:06,752
Or ran into a Stinging Jinx.
Was it you, dearie?

1184
01:58:11,503 --> 01:58:14,267
Give me her wand.
We'll see what her last spell was.

1185
01:58:15,375 --> 01:58:17,536
Ah. Got you.

1186
01:58:21,103 --> 01:58:22,832
What is that?

1187
01:58:24,623 --> 01:58:26,215
Where'd you get that from?

1188
01:58:26,319 --> 01:58:29,811
It was in her bag when we searched her.
Reckon it's mine now.

1189
01:58:33,263 --> 01:58:34,594
Are you mad?

1190
01:58:42,511 --> 01:58:45,344
Go! Get out!

1191
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:54,803
Cissy, put the boys in the cellar.

1192
01:58:54,799 --> 01:59:00,169
I want to have a little conversation
with this one, girl-to-girl.

1193
01:59:08,623 --> 01:59:11,717
What are we gonna do?
We can't leave Hermione alone with her.

1194
01:59:11,759 --> 01:59:13,124
Ron?

1195
01:59:18,064 --> 01:59:19,622
Harry?

1196
01:59:25,039 --> 01:59:26,597
Luna?

1197
01:59:27,119 --> 01:59:31,283
That sword is meant to be in my vault
at Gringotts. How did you get it?

1198
01:59:31,279 --> 01:59:34,407
What else did you and your friends take
from my vault?!

1199
01:59:34,447 --> 01:59:39,817
I didn't take anything. Please.
I didn't take anything.

1200
01:59:39,759 --> 01:59:41,283
I don't believe it.

1201
01:59:46,575 --> 01:59:47,667
We have to do something.

1202
01:59:47,791 --> 01:59:51,818
There's no way out of here.
We've tried everything. It's enchanted.

1203
01:59:51,823 --> 01:59:54,519
- Please! please!
- Shut up!

1204
01:59:54,576 --> 01:59:56,373
You're bleeding, Harry.

1205
01:59:56,464 --> 01:59:58,489
That's a curious thing
to keep in your sock.

1206
02:00:07,279 --> 02:00:08,405
Help us.

1207
02:00:13,903 --> 02:00:15,803
- Let her go.
- Shut up. Get back.

1208
02:00:17,008 --> 02:00:21,206
You, goblin, come with me.

1209
02:00:39,888 --> 02:00:41,378
- Aah!
- Dobby?

1210
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:43,559
What are you doing here?

1211
02:00:43,663 --> 02:00:45,927
Dobby has come to rescue
Harry Potter, of course.

1212
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,468
Dobby will always be there
for Harry Potter.

1213
02:00:48,528 --> 02:00:52,123
You can Apparate in and out of this room?
Could you take us with you?

1214
02:00:52,144 --> 02:00:53,907
Of course, sir. I'm an elf.

1215
02:00:54,608 --> 02:00:56,473
Works for me.

1216
02:00:56,624 --> 02:00:58,990
Dobby, I want you to take Luna
and Mr. Ollivander--

1217
02:00:59,056 --> 02:01:01,490
Shell Cottage
on the outskirts of Tinworth.

1218
02:01:01,744 --> 02:01:02,768
Trust me.

1219
02:01:03,504 --> 02:01:04,937
Whenever you're ready, sir.

1220
02:01:05,552 --> 02:01:08,248
Sir? I like her very much.

1221
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:16,179
Meet me at the top of the stairs
in 10 seconds.

1222
02:01:24,752 --> 02:01:26,515
Ow.

1223
02:01:31,632 --> 02:01:33,862
Who gets his wand?

1224
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:40,393
I'm only going to
ask you once more, goblin.

1225
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:43,801
Think very, very carefully
before you answer.

1226
02:01:44,016 --> 02:01:45,574
I don't know.

1227
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:48,877
You don't know?
Why weren't you doing your job?

1228
02:01:48,912 --> 02:01:52,143
Who got into my vault?

1229
02:01:53,233 --> 02:01:57,670
Who stole it? Who stole it? Well?

1230
02:01:57,648 --> 02:02:01,675
When I was last in your vault,
the sword was there.

1231
02:02:04,176 --> 02:02:07,373
Oh, well then, perhaps
it just walked out on its own then.

1232
02:02:07,408 --> 02:02:09,842
There is no place safer than Gringotts.

1233
02:02:09,905 --> 02:02:11,338
Liar!

1234
02:02:13,137 --> 02:02:16,538
Consider yourself lucky, goblin.

1235
02:02:18,737 --> 02:02:22,138
The same won't be said for this one.

1236
02:02:22,160 --> 02:02:23,923
Like hell.

1237
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:25,788
Expelliarmus!

1238
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:28,212
Stupefy.

1239
02:02:32,144 --> 02:02:33,509
Stop!

1240
02:02:34,576 --> 02:02:36,134
Drop your wands.

1241
02:02:38,832 --> 02:02:39,856
I said, drop them!

1242
02:02:41,265 --> 02:02:42,698
Pick them up, Draco, now.

1243
02:02:43,472 --> 02:02:47,602
Well, well, well,
look what we have here.

1244
02:02:48,976 --> 02:02:50,466
It's Harry Potter.

1245
02:02:51,152 --> 02:02:57,523
He's all bright and shiny and new again,
just in time for the Dark Lord.

1246
02:02:57,424 --> 02:02:59,449
Call him.

1247
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:04,757
Call him.

1248
02:03:38,449 --> 02:03:40,280
Stupefy!

1249
02:03:40,945 --> 02:03:42,640
Stupid elf.

1250
02:03:42,736 --> 02:03:45,762
- You could've killed me.
- Dobby never meant to kill.

1251
02:03:45,808 --> 02:03:49,835
Dobby only meant to maim
or seriously injure.

1252
02:03:51,889 --> 02:03:55,222
How dare you take a witch's wand?

1253
02:03:55,249 --> 02:03:58,241
How dare you defy your masters?

1254
02:03:58,288 --> 02:04:01,416
Dobby has no master.

1255
02:04:01,457 --> 02:04:03,948
Dobby is a free elf.

1256
02:04:04,017 --> 02:04:08,977
And Dobby has come
to save Harry Potter and his friends.

1257
02:04:37,393 --> 02:04:39,054
Hermione.

1258
02:04:39,153 --> 02:04:41,644
You're all right. We're safe.

1259
02:04:41,713 --> 02:04:43,738
We're all safe.

1260
02:04:44,497 --> 02:04:46,692
Harry Potter.

1261
02:04:50,193 --> 02:04:52,024
Dobby.

1262
02:05:02,033 --> 02:05:05,093
Dobby. No, just-- Hold on.

1263
02:05:05,137 --> 02:05:09,471
Hold on. Look, just hold on, okay?

1264
02:05:09,457 --> 02:05:11,516
We'll fix you.

1265
02:05:11,857 --> 02:05:14,587
Hermione will have something.

1266
02:05:14,641 --> 02:05:16,973
In your bag. Hermione?

1267
02:05:18,449 --> 02:05:19,780
Hermione?

1268
02:05:21,841 --> 02:05:24,969
What is it? Help me.

1269
02:05:27,314 --> 02:05:30,442
Such a beautiful place...

1270
02:05:32,402 --> 02:05:34,666
...to be with friends.

1271
02:05:36,306 --> 02:05:41,710
Dobby is happy to be with his friend...

1272
02:05:43,793 --> 02:05:46,227
...Harry Potter.

1273
02:06:06,066 --> 02:06:08,466
We should close his eyes.

1274
02:06:08,594 --> 02:06:10,619
Don't you think?

1275
02:06:15,442 --> 02:06:16,841
There.

1276
02:06:17,234 --> 02:06:19,668
Now he could be sleeping.

1277
02:06:34,258 --> 02:06:36,317
I want to bury him.

1278
02:06:37,234 --> 02:06:40,795
Properly. Without magic.
