1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,858
He was just

2
00:00:48,078 --> 00:00:49,481
all alone.

3
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,662
He couldn't enjoy a game with anyone else.

4
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,988
Like living inside a dream...

5
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:00,810
That's the kind of man he was.

6
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:07,305
Wake up.

7
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:09,991
Wake up!

8
00:01:16,882 --> 00:01:18,253
Alright?

9
00:01:19,825 --> 00:01:23,947
The world is like a steaming pot of stew.

10
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,241
lnside the mixed-up stew.

11
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,004
no ingredient is any more
important than another.

12
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,623
ln the end, all you see is the combined product,

13
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:36,394
but there is one thing that you can't forget.

14
00:01:37,268 --> 00:01:39,086
Do you know what that one thing is?

15
00:01:40,277 --> 00:01:41,419
Meat?

16
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:43,656
Everyone thinks that,

17
00:01:44,052 --> 00:01:49,067
but if there's no stew base, it's not a stew.

18
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:52,688
With the same ingredients,
it could become a curry,

19
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:55,018
The stew base is on that counter over there...

20
00:01:55,383 --> 00:01:56,656
l'm not talking about that!

21
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,722
Damn that robber bitches a lot.

22
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:02,898
Spike, let's go.

23
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,102
l'm going in from the back

24
00:02:05,657 --> 00:02:06,864
Alright.

25
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,613
lf you're waitin for the police,
it's useless,

26
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:13,301
We know all the security around here.

27
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:14,863
Why do you think we do this?

28
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:16,654
Engine, hurry, up and do it!

29
00:02:17,817 --> 00:02:20,149
This is the mark of a security firm.

30
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,932
l was an employee there.

31
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,348
l see.

32
00:02:23,865 --> 00:02:26,546
l was laid off and became a robber.

33
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,047
lsn't that funny?

34
00:02:28,507 --> 00:02:29,267
l see...

35
00:02:29,563 --> 00:02:30,934
Laugh.

36
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:32,118
Is it funny?

37
00:02:33,243 --> 00:02:35,150
lt is funny huh?

38
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:38,546
l didn't tell you to laugh!

39
00:02:42,686 --> 00:02:44,471
Hey! This place is closed.

40
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:45,776
Go somewhere else.

41
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,410
lf you understand, then hurry up
and put the money in this money card.

42
00:02:58,335 --> 00:02:59,990
Who the fuck are you?

43
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,996
Hey! Can't you hear me?

44
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:05,397
Shit...

45
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,759
Hey! Take those off and listen to me!

46
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:14,614
l'll take this.

47
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:23,517
You bitch!

48
00:03:36,262 --> 00:03:36,957
Spike!

49
00:03:37,445 --> 00:03:38,336
Yeah?

50
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:43,134
Can you put the tab for the donut on them?

51
00:03:53,957 --> 00:03:54,848
Don't move!

52
00:03:56,488 --> 00:03:57,914
Jet...

53
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:58,944
Yeah?

54
00:03:59,368 --> 00:04:00,739
You said three people.

55
00:04:01,256 --> 00:04:02,430
Drop your weapons!

56
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:05,662
To deceive an enemy,
you start with your ally.

57
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:07,071
How does deceiving me help?

58
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,356
Are you listening?

59
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:10,564
Most of all, you took too long taking a shit!

60
00:04:10,986 --> 00:04:13,318
Shut up! Don't you care if she dies?

61
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:22,179
Are you listening?

62
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:23,615
You're ignoring me?

63
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,838
Can't you see her?

64
00:04:25,388 --> 00:04:26,945
l'm sorry, Grandma.

65
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:29,540
We're not police or security guards

66
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:33,185
We don't think about saving civilian lives.

67
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:34,598
What?

68
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,280
Seems it's not your day.

69
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,169
Damn it, he's a cowboy.

70
00:04:39,534 --> 00:04:41,025
Hey! Hey! What are you saying?

71
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,653
You low life!

72
00:04:53,841 --> 00:04:54,732
You're a cowboy?

73
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:56,649
Who...

74
00:04:56,944 --> 00:04:57,923
Who are you?

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,785
Just your average bounty hunter.

76
00:07:10,117 --> 00:07:12,090
Hurry up and go, Jet.

77
00:07:12,676 --> 00:07:13,917
Don't rush me.

78
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,929
Huh?

79
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:26,524
Why don't you think before you go?

80
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,248
Hurry up...

81
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,042
ln the game of Shougi,

82
00:07:31,302 --> 00:07:35,163
you think ahead and predict
the opponent's moves.

83
00:07:35,526 --> 00:07:37,499
Moves!

84
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:42,011
When the timing is right,
be where your opponent wants to be.

85
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:44,446
Being one step ahead is true purpose.

86
00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:47,519
lt doesn't mean that you can just move
wherever you want.

87
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:50,790
l want to move here.

88
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:54,402
With just rules, you can't win at Shougi,

89
00:07:54,665 --> 00:07:56,997
You don't get it, do you?

90
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:00,261
Alright, Spike, ln Shougi,

91
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,144
your personality shows in the game.

92
00:08:02,635 --> 00:08:06,178
lf you just play around when you feel like it and...

93
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:07,749
Hurry up...

94
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:11,780
Spike, if the hostage had been shot,
what were you going to do?

95
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:13,439
lt happens...

96
00:08:13,771 --> 00:08:19,266
As usual, for a 125,000 wulong criminal,
there's too much risk involved

97
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,493
Bounty hunting is harder than just that.

98
00:08:24,109 --> 00:08:27,619
Before l teamed up with you,
l lived a normal life.

99
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:37,060
Yes! Yes! That's the move l was going to make!

100
00:08:37,454 --> 00:08:38,977
How about that, Spike?

101
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:44,684
Found him! Found him! Found him!

102
00:09:26,038 --> 00:09:28,175
Knock knock, chick!

103
00:09:28,632 --> 00:09:33,614
Ship number 12 took route 8 going into the city.

104
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:35,281
Okay.

105
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,066
Send me the car and the criminal's information.

106
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:38,772
Yes, yes.

107
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,287
Underaged, huh?

108
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,687
l hate taking care of kids.

109
00:10:43,552 --> 00:10:44,531
lt's not him?

110
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,298
lt's time for CBC News.

111
00:12:00,076 --> 00:12:01,763
Starting with today's top news...

112
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,732
At 10:00 am, on Albea City Number7 Highway
in the Red Hills Residential Area

113
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:11,457
an exploding gas tanker killed 72 people
and injured 15 more.

114
00:12:11,855 --> 00:12:13,313
The impact was devastating.

115
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,490
Now to Ms, Lai Lee ,who is live at the scene.

116
00:12:17,006 --> 00:12:18,758
l'm on site here, where

117
00:12:19,183 --> 00:12:23,337
rescuers are searching for victims,
and experts are analyzing the disaster area.

118
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,154
After the original accident,
another incident occurred.

119
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:30,633
People up to three kilometers from the scene
started to lose consciousness and collapse.

120
00:12:31,026 --> 00:12:33,195
For a short period, there was extreme panic,

121
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:38,182
Now, three hours later ,
things have started to calm down.

122
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:42,828
There must have been some sort of chemical
inside the tanker.

123
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:47,693
Yes, The police have told us that
the chemicals ignited and caused the explosion.

124
00:12:48,116 --> 00:12:49,519
There is chance that this was a biological attack,

125
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:52,173
so because of that, no one can enter
the area of the accident,

126
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,118
Has the reason for the explosion been confirmed yet?

127
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:58,347
At the moment, we don't know any of the details,

128
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:01,673
However, the gas tanker was reported stolen.

129
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:06,702
The police think that there is a possibility
of biological terrorism.

130
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:10,474
That's all for now. This was live from
the scene of the accident.

131
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:13,293
Every station is talking about this.

132
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,337
Again...

133
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:17,193
Huh?

134
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:21,354
lt seems like last night was also Cup Ramen.

135
00:13:22,103 --> 00:13:23,561
Don't be an idiot,

136
00:13:23,992 --> 00:13:26,957
Yesterday, and the day before,
all 3 meals were Cup Ramen.

137
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:28,531
Did you forget?

138
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:29,716
l see...

139
00:13:30,072 --> 00:13:31,214
l thought it was a dream.

140
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:33,970
lf you prefer something else, l have others.

141
00:13:34,427 --> 00:13:37,523
Cup Udon... Cup Soba...
lf you pull the string it's really hot.

142
00:13:37,755 --> 00:13:43,217
We also have Cup Sushi, but that expired a year ago.

143
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:44,722
lf that's okay...

144
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:46,357
Thank you for the food!

145
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:59,921
Humans can't always eat dried food.

146
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:02,769
We also need protein.

147
00:14:03,262 --> 00:14:04,306
What are you talking about?

148
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:06,676
l'm saying meat tastes good.

149
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,479
Next time, you should catch a bigger one
instead of a smaller one.

150
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,749
Hey, Faye! How was it?

151
00:14:18,336 --> 00:14:20,822
How was it? Listen to what l have to say.

152
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:26,520
So he's a simple-minded hacker?
l'll get him after l go to the derby.

153
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:28,921
There was a weird explosion,

154
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:31,705
Well l'm taking one...

155
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:37,438
Yeah, this.

156
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:38,873
You were there?

157
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:42,529
So there's a big fuss about this, huh?

158
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:50,176
Huh? Virus? Weapon? Oh, l see...

159
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:51,677
Huh?

160
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:54,330
Hey, what's this?

161
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,093
Hey you guys! Even Ein?

162
00:14:56,677 --> 00:15:00,187
You're dirty! Bacteria! Bacteria!

163
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:01,658
What was that?

164
00:15:02,406 --> 00:15:03,199
Ah! Please, no! Stop!

165
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:04,470
Stop it! Stop it already!

166
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,390
Government officials have decided to put
a 300,000,000 wulong bounty

167
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:09,218
on the head of the perpetrator of this crime.

168
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,782
300,000,000?

169
00:15:11,304 --> 00:15:12,064
Huh?

170
00:15:38,924 --> 00:15:39,815
What's the meaning of this?

171
00:15:40,234 --> 00:15:40,994
Even there?

172
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:41,920
Yeah.

173
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:49,863
How was it?

174
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:52,836
lt's strange,
l've never seen anything like this.

175
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,679
On most of the patients,
l can see brain activity.

176
00:15:57,102 --> 00:15:58,659
There's absolutely no clue as to what did it though.

177
00:15:59,054 --> 00:16:00,392
We have no idea whatsoever.

178
00:16:01,423 --> 00:16:03,208
l don't know any more than you do.

179
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:08,033
ln every patient, there was normal bodily activity,

180
00:16:08,816 --> 00:16:10,985
but now they're all like new born babies.

181
00:16:11,664 --> 00:16:13,384
lt just gets worse.

182
00:16:14,032 --> 00:16:16,234
Worse than natural causes, or the Ebola virus?

183
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,658
lf anything, it's more like AlDS.

184
00:16:20,081 --> 00:16:21,866
We can't tell what it is though.

185
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:23,627
What's that supposed to mean?

186
00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:25,445
There's no evidence of anything ever being there.

187
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:29,035
lt's annoying that there aren't any clues.

188
00:16:30,642 --> 00:16:32,527
The only thing that we can think of is

189
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:36,328
a new type of virus, or a biological weapon,

190
00:16:36,852 --> 00:16:38,125
lt is ...

191
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:41,224
tremendously powerful.

192
00:16:41,491 --> 00:16:43,660
Huh?

193
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,013
l'm sorry, it's my allergies.

194
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,921
l thought they were gone.

195
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,096
Maybe it has something to do with the virus.

196
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:10,771
Perhaps someone is spreading it.

197
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:13,941
Ah... this is a smoke-free section.

198
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,025
He's testing us.

199
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:23,954
Are you sure this is safe?

200
00:17:24,282 --> 00:17:26,582
Even if it's not, you're coming with me.

201
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,954
l got it!

202
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:29,905
Bio-terrorism...

203
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:32,207
Spike, look at this.

204
00:17:32,604 --> 00:17:33,615
l have no choice, huh?

205
00:17:33,948 --> 00:17:34,806
Just to let you know,

206
00:17:35,196 --> 00:17:36,207
my information isn't cheap.

207
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:37,517
l know

208
00:17:37,884 --> 00:17:38,928
Hurry up and show me.

209
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,466
lt's very rare information.

210
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:42,288
Can you do it for us, Ed?

211
00:17:42,622 --> 00:17:43,317
Alrighty!

212
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:45,654
This is the hacker, Lee Samsung.

213
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,636
He has a bounty of 5,000,000 wulongs.

214
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:51,510
and l've found his fake money card.

215
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:53,138
How did you do that?

216
00:17:53,503 --> 00:17:55,476
l hacked into the card company.

217
00:17:56,128 --> 00:17:59,442
Someone used it,
and the truck suddenly exploded.

218
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:02,234
The guy that was on it wasn't Lee.

219
00:18:02,686 --> 00:18:03,730
Maybe he was an ally.

220
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,071
l can't really tell.

221
00:18:07,329 --> 00:18:08,918
What wonderful information...

222
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:13,914
You think we can catch him
with that messed up picture?

223
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:15,132
What are you saying?

224
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:17,788
l remember his face perfectly

225
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:19,673
Here you go!

226
00:18:20,162 --> 00:18:23,957
Use this pen.
You can write on the monitor with it.

227
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:27,448
On top of that, how can we be sure that
he's the criminal?

228
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:31,637
By being there without using a gas mask,
he'd already be dead.

229
00:18:32,131 --> 00:18:33,437
That man is not dead.

230
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,001
How can you tell?

231
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:37,212
l just know...

232
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:40,092
You just know?

233
00:18:40,676 --> 00:18:41,600
lt's done.

234
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:42,622
Huh?

235
00:18:42,981 --> 00:18:43,774
What's this?

236
00:18:44,486 --> 00:18:46,905
An Abangld's face or something?

237
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:49,818
This is great!

238
00:18:50,343 --> 00:18:53,636
lf you can catch him with this drawing,
l'll pay the bounty!

239
00:18:53,991 --> 00:18:54,882
ls that so...

240
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,347
lt doesn't matter anymore.

241
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:59,230
l 'll go catch him myself.

242
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,499
Ah, well that was a waste of time.

243
00:19:03,623 --> 00:19:05,825
l'll go look around.

244
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:08,354
You do something?
What's the world coming to?

245
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:11,518
A woman's hunch can't be ignored

246
00:19:11,977 --> 00:19:12,803
But...

247
00:19:13,322 --> 00:19:16,189
Besides, sometimes l like to eat something
that's not inside a cup.

248
00:20:24,212 --> 00:20:26,414
Back in the day,
there were planes flying all over the place.

249
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:27,947
Yeah, there sure were.

250
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:33,166
l used to fly a military transport

251
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,206
What are you talking about?

252
00:20:35,605 --> 00:20:38,668
You flew a crop duster!

253
00:20:39,255 --> 00:20:40,462
Really?

254
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,288
Do you have a moment?

255
00:20:43,126 --> 00:20:44,911
l have some questions.

256
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:48,943
We're too deaf to hear anything
so that's impossible

257
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:50,413
Do you know of a seed shop?

258
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:53,109
They sell seeds everywhere around here.

259
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,147
A store that doesn't sell seeds around here...

260
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:58,126
Police aren't welcome.

261
00:20:58,584 --> 00:21:00,206
Do l look like a cop?

262
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:02,508
More like a Yakuza...

263
00:21:02,906 --> 00:21:04,364
Same thing.

264
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,320
l'm a bounty hunter.

265
00:21:07,452 --> 00:21:09,237
So you're a cowboy, huh?

266
00:21:09,628 --> 00:21:11,601
l loved them a long time ago...

267
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,070
Then you know what l'm here for.

268
00:21:13,627 --> 00:21:14,736
You're welcome even less now.

269
00:21:32,511 --> 00:21:34,363
Are you the one looking for the seed plant?

270
00:21:42,111 --> 00:21:44,018
Do you have one that can't be seen
by the naked eye?

271
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,459
Of course.

272
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,894
You can get anything on a Moroccan street.

273
00:21:49,535 --> 00:21:51,287
lsn't that why you came here?

274
00:22:30,214 --> 00:22:32,154
Do you want bean starch? Almonds?

275
00:22:33,447 --> 00:22:34,753
This one's Carbaru seed,

276
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:39,427
to get back at your wife when she's unfaithful

277
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,531
To see if it's a good or a bad seed, eat it fast.

278
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,376
lf it's poisonous,
you can throw it back up.

279
00:22:44,808 --> 00:22:46,560
lf you eat it slowly,
the poison will go through your body,

280
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:48,924
and kill you before you can throw it back up.

281
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:50,237
l don't have a wife.

282
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,061
You're living in bliss then.

283
00:22:52,489 --> 00:22:53,598
What l want to know is...

284
00:22:54,025 --> 00:22:54,916
That seed is bad.

285
00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:57,344
Pitacras died because of it.

286
00:22:58,059 --> 00:22:59,746
You can't make light of seeds.

287
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:08,703
The one l'm looking for is the virus
used in the tanker incident.

288
00:23:12,717 --> 00:23:14,023
Do you believe in demons?

289
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:15,302
Huh?

290
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,040
ln this world, there are things
that exist an things that don't.

291
00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:21,704
Why do people worry about things they can't see?

292
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,622
Why do people love the air
and want to fly into space?

293
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:31,814
lt's because we all used to be able to fly.

294
00:23:32,622 --> 00:23:35,075
So this place is a path to the heavens?

295
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:38,114
Anything you can see in your mind can exist.

296
00:23:38,705 --> 00:23:40,612
Even if you can't see it.

297
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,720
So there is a virus.

298
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:47,111
That's nothing like a virus.

299
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,733
Reachio! l've got something good.

300
00:24:27,224 --> 00:24:28,781
This one suits you perfectly.

301
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:32,907
No, this pot fits perfectly for his man.

302
00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:33,963
Huh?

303
00:24:34,423 --> 00:24:36,625
Yes, this pot fits you perfectly.

304
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,318
How does it suit me perfectly?

305
00:24:39,224 --> 00:24:41,197
You should always take what suits you.

306
00:24:41,656 --> 00:24:44,523
Hey! l'm not here to shop.

307
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:46,641
You just bought something

308
00:24:47,002 --> 00:24:47,566
Good bye

309
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:48,853
Hey, wait a minute!

310
00:24:49,337 --> 00:24:50,097
En Chara!

311
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:51,219
Hey!

312
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:52,719
Wait! Hey!

313
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:34,682
20th century games are really good,

314
00:25:36,032 --> 00:25:38,899
Games from this century are getting boring.

315
00:25:39,488 --> 00:25:42,333
l'm enjoying old school games like this one.

316
00:25:42,913 --> 00:25:46,227
Back in the day,
games like this were enough for everyone,

317
00:25:46,882 --> 00:25:48,308
Hackers are the same.

318
00:25:48,738 --> 00:25:51,191
lt was better when there weren't many.

319
00:25:51,587 --> 00:25:55,162
Small things like that got you left
in the history books.

320
00:25:55,748 --> 00:25:57,950
Now, protection is tighter everywhere.

321
00:25:58,338 --> 00:26:00,757
lf you don't do something big,
no one will recognize you.

322
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:03,841
That's why l'm grateful to you, seriously.

323
00:26:04,452 --> 00:26:05,878
l always wanted to

324
00:26:07,078 --> 00:26:09,280
try being a terrorist,

325
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:26,944
Aww, l died.

326
00:26:29,992 --> 00:26:31,134
Let me see your license.

327
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:32,514
Where are you going?

328
00:26:33,064 --> 00:26:35,135
From this point on there's only storage space.

329
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:43,780
Aww, he died.

330
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,705
lf they can actually see the enemy,

331
00:27:10,317 --> 00:27:12,420
Sheriffs can take care of things easily,

332
00:27:12,974 --> 00:27:16,135
Well, what was inside the tanker?

333
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,371
Nothing.

334
00:27:19,886 --> 00:27:21,312
What's that suppose to mean?

335
00:27:21,711 --> 00:27:22,984
That's what it means.

336
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,504
lt seems they've never heard of,
or seen it, before.

337
00:27:38,738 --> 00:27:39,629
This is ?

338
00:27:40,018 --> 00:27:43,528
Near the asteroids, we found a space truck.

339
00:27:44,274 --> 00:27:46,214
The driver died instantly.

340
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:47,917
He was a convicted criminal.

341
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:49,417
A run-away?

342
00:27:49,843 --> 00:27:53,965
The truck's owner was from a company
called Cherious Medical,

343
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,734
but they didn't even file a theft report.

344
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:00,494
There was a rumor that they had something critical

345
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:02,637
inside the truck that no one could find out about.

346
00:28:03,094 --> 00:28:04,814
Then the tanker incident happened soon after.

347
00:28:05,238 --> 00:28:06,479
Smells fishy,

348
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:09,870
Even for a medical corporation
they have a heavy guard.

349
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,267
Why don't you forcefully investigate?

350
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,053
You can use any reason to get in.

351
00:28:15,575 --> 00:28:18,704
Things have changed since you left.

352
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:22,741
The lSSP is full of corrupt hyenas
who are just looking for money.

353
00:28:23,545 --> 00:28:26,674
The higher ranks want more power.

354
00:28:27,002 --> 00:28:29,902
The low lifes just get in with the Yakuza.

355
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:32,500
lf we get picked on,
it's not gonna be pretty.

356
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:34,002
Stinks like shit...

357
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,428
lt hasn't changed.

358
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:40,790
That's why l quit.

359
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,579
Do you know about Dengoku?

360
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:19,416
The place between Heaven and Hell.

361
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,655
lt is a place where people are left behind
and cannot ascend into Heaven.

362
00:29:26,657 --> 00:29:29,720
Yes, lt is about this world.

363
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,068
ls this all?

364
00:29:35,331 --> 00:29:38,176
ln this one capsule,
there is 30,000 of them.

365
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,435
lf you open the capsule it will
create copies of itself.

366
00:29:42,597 --> 00:29:44,284
Hey, be careful with it!

367
00:29:45,124 --> 00:29:46,942
What about the money?

368
00:29:52,806 --> 00:29:55,225
lsn't this different from your offer?

369
00:29:55,622 --> 00:29:57,987
You'll get the other half after the party.

370
00:29:58,822 --> 00:30:00,574
You can do with the rest as you please.

371
00:30:01,254 --> 00:30:02,592
uh, yeah...

372
00:30:02,982 --> 00:30:04,800
l'll be saying good bye to this cheap life.

373
00:30:06,344 --> 00:30:08,096
Can l ask you a question?

374
00:30:09,255 --> 00:30:11,806
Why on Halloween?

375
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:13,951
ln the old days,

376
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:20,252
Halloween was a day when people prayed
for souls to go to Heaven.

377
00:30:21,961 --> 00:30:23,452
You should pray.

378
00:30:39,596 --> 00:30:40,575
Amigo!

379
00:30:41,228 --> 00:30:45,382
Everyone in the Milky Way wants
to get that 300,000,000!~

380
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:48,770
Just like every day, it's time for the Big shot!

381
00:30:49,485 --> 00:30:52,646
Like always, we'll be giving out information on bounties!

382
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:56,647
Today, we'll be on air twenty minutes longer then usual!

383
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,070
All because of the main target
of you bounty hunters,

384
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,462
and because he's worth 300,000,000 wulongs!

385
00:31:03,856 --> 00:31:06,919
He's the galaxy's highest bounty ever!

386
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,692
The only problem is that we don't know who he is,
or what he looks like!

387
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,134
Don't we have any information to give out?

388
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:13,323
Nope!

389
00:31:13,712 --> 00:31:15,530
We don't even know what was spread out
from the explosion!

390
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,126
There's no one living who saw the incident!

391
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,880
Then what are we supposed to be doing?

392
00:31:20,305 --> 00:31:22,190
Because of this, we'll be taking calls!

393
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:25,838
We'll be giving this gift to anyone
with information!

394
00:31:26,578 --> 00:31:29,293
You can call us with this number!

395
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:31,077
First come, first served!

396
00:31:37,268 --> 00:31:38,726
Ahem...

397
00:31:39,155 --> 00:31:41,771
Well, for now, commercial break!

398
00:31:42,773 --> 00:31:44,330
Well, that was useless.

399
00:31:44,917 --> 00:31:46,059
Faye! Faye!

400
00:31:46,486 --> 00:31:47,181
Huh?

401
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:48,880
Can you look?

402
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:51,560
The previous shot.

403
00:31:59,032 --> 00:31:59,858
Tattoo?

404
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:03,210
l looked for the same mark,

405
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:06,702
Which one is it?

406
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,386
Which on is it...

407
00:32:10,585 --> 00:32:11,378
lt's this one.

408
00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:13,042
ls that right?

409
00:32:13,624 --> 00:32:16,043
Yeah, it's this one for sure.

410
00:32:17,722 --> 00:32:20,981
Mars Special Force Fleet number 7.

411
00:32:21,532 --> 00:32:23,505
Special Force mark, huh?

412
00:32:23,835 --> 00:32:24,563
A military man...

413
00:32:24,922 --> 00:32:27,091
lt was disbanded three years ago.

414
00:32:27,643 --> 00:32:29,265
Do you have any date on this Force?

415
00:32:29,626 --> 00:32:30,452
Yeah.

416
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:34,709
Huh?

417
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:35,700
What' this?

418
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,398
They're almost all dead.

419
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,729
Go to the next one.

420
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:42,480
What's wrong, Ein?

421
00:32:43,805 --> 00:32:45,078
Really?

422
00:32:45,437 --> 00:32:46,361
What? Hurry up!

423
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:48,338
Ein said it's him.

424
00:32:49,471 --> 00:32:50,929
How does Ein know?

425
00:32:52,607 --> 00:32:55,190
Look, he died in the Titan War.

426
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:58,264
Damn it l quit, Clean it up.

427
00:32:58,687 --> 00:32:59,698
Okay...

428
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:02,484
Finding information this way doesn't suit me.

429
00:33:05,185 --> 00:33:08,728
Living life easily and not doing
much suits me a lot more.

430
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,454
Faye!

431
00:33:10,817 --> 00:33:15,037
Why do l have to be with these people
and lose my beautiful 20's years?

432
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,504
Faye! Faye!

433
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:18,390
l wonder... where did l go wrong?

434
00:33:18,786 --> 00:33:20,671
Lee used the card again!

435
00:33:21,218 --> 00:33:22,807
Oh! l forgot about that!

436
00:33:25,092 --> 00:33:27,229
Hey, What's that, pottery?

437
00:33:27,781 --> 00:33:28,607
Yeah, something like that.

438
00:33:35,108 --> 00:33:36,446
Oh? ls my gift an octopus pot?

439
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:37,436
Well, yeah...

440
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:38,904
Who's this?

441
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:43,735
Ein said it's this person,
but Faye doesn't believe him.

442
00:33:44,134 --> 00:33:44,960
Huh?

443
00:33:45,316 --> 00:33:47,735
She says it's one of these five.

444
00:33:48,072 --> 00:33:50,372
Vincent Boraju...

445
00:33:51,304 --> 00:33:52,097
Spike...

446
00:33:52,456 --> 00:33:53,347
Did you find anything?

447
00:33:56,392 --> 00:33:57,436
What's this thing?

448
00:33:57,832 --> 00:33:59,073
lt's the pot''best suited'' for me.

449
00:33:59,592 --> 00:34:00,385
How about you?

450
00:34:02,728 --> 00:34:03,969
The western was really good.

451
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:05,889
Hey...

452
00:34:06,249 --> 00:34:08,067
Let Ed see too!

453
00:34:13,546 --> 00:34:14,306
Very amusing.

454
00:34:15,115 --> 00:34:16,606
We should sell her to the circus.

455
00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:20,450
l asked the detective,
but l only found out that

456
00:34:20,973 --> 00:34:24,004
there's a weird chemical place

457
00:34:24,844 --> 00:34:26,784
There's something inside.

458
00:34:29,261 --> 00:34:30,664
What's this?

459
00:34:42,638 --> 00:34:43,879
Hey, you're pretty good.

460
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:45,865
Here they come.

461
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,288
Are you alone?

462
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,269
lf you want, l can play with you.

463
00:34:51,727 --> 00:34:52,553
You're right,

464
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,980
but not these virtual games,
l prefer reality.

465
00:34:55,665 --> 00:34:56,742
Reality?

466
00:35:00,657 --> 00:35:02,794
We finally meet, hacker boy.

467
00:35:03,761 --> 00:35:05,646
l was only 500 points away

468
00:35:06,256 --> 00:35:08,425
from meeting Spooky Donkey.

469
00:35:09,203 --> 00:35:10,726
Are you listening?

470
00:35:11,633 --> 00:35:12,775
Damn it.

471
00:35:13,203 --> 00:35:15,176
You almost never get to him.

472
00:35:17,747 --> 00:35:19,238
How are you going to pay for this,

473
00:35:19,603 --> 00:35:21,061
bounty hunting lady?

474
00:35:21,525 --> 00:35:23,212
Do you have any idea what kind of
situation you're in now?

475
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:25,870
Game over, boy.

476
00:35:26,867 --> 00:35:29,483
Revenge for Spooky Donkey is great.

477
00:35:32,021 --> 00:35:32,781
Huh?

478
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:39,696
What? What's going on?

479
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:41,457
Wait!

480
00:35:50,616 --> 00:35:52,042
What? Wait!

481
00:36:14,268 --> 00:36:16,339
lt's a weird shape.

482
00:36:17,468 --> 00:36:19,353
So, what's inside?

483
00:36:19,931 --> 00:36:22,547
lt's a lyn lyn lymphocyte.

484
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,912
Lymphocyte? The ones that are in your blood?

485
00:36:26,302 --> 00:36:29,299
This one has a weird shape though.

486
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,707
How so?

487
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,237
l don't really know anything about these.

488
00:36:33,854 --> 00:36:36,601
This is the real lymphocyte,

489
00:36:36,991 --> 00:36:39,640
but this one's a bit different.

490
00:36:41,184 --> 00:36:42,358
How is it different?

491
00:36:42,848 --> 00:36:44,154
Zoom in.

492
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:49,304
l still don't understand.

493
00:36:49,856 --> 00:36:51,478
Then let's microwave it.

494
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:52,534
What?

495
00:36:53,025 --> 00:36:56,088
lt's a really weird shape.

496
00:37:02,402 --> 00:37:03,326
What?

497
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:14,583
What's that?

498
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:53,854
Hello? Total Clean Corporation?

499
00:38:13,037 --> 00:38:14,408
Please continue with your report.

500
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:19,810
The lSSP is investigating this incident
as a terrorist attack.

501
00:38:20,205 --> 00:38:22,308
They have no idea who's behind it though.

502
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:27,464
The ''object '' they're investigating is a virus.

503
00:38:28,046 --> 00:38:30,183
They won't be able to find out anything for a while.

504
00:38:30,478 --> 00:38:33,410
However, we must be cautious.

505
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:38,380
ln the Moroccan street, there was
some information given about the accident.

506
00:38:38,766 --> 00:38:42,440
We have encountered the spy,
but Mendel went into hiding.

507
00:38:42,992 --> 00:38:47,365
We must solve every problem for this case.

508
00:38:47,665 --> 00:38:50,477
lt's a problem that will affect
the whole nation.

509
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:55,050
Did Vincent really use ''that?''

510
00:38:56,817 --> 00:39:00,491
That is a demon that can't be seen.

511
00:39:01,267 --> 00:39:03,370
lt's something that shouldn't exist,

512
00:39:04,147 --> 00:39:07,690
and is forbidden from living.

513
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:09,898
Vincent and Mendel...

514
00:39:11,509 --> 00:39:12,716
Do you understand?

515
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,089
Yes.

516
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:20,775
Do you know where my car is?

517
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,470
Didn't you just leave?

518
00:40:06,749 --> 00:40:07,990
Put your hands in the air.

519
00:40:12,222 --> 00:40:13,844
l've seen that face before.

520
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,398
You look pretty good.

521
00:40:18,494 --> 00:40:19,920
That doesn't make you look good.

522
00:40:20,255 --> 00:40:20,918
ls that so?

523
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:22,901
Look backwards.

524
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:43,895
What do you know?

525
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:45,400
Do you want to pick?

526
00:40:45,794 --> 00:40:47,514
lf it's heads, l'll speak honestly.

527
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:03,166
For a medical lab office lady,
you're pretty strong.

528
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:06,558
Knowing too much is sure to shorten your life.

529
00:41:06,918 --> 00:41:08,858
Strong girls are my type.

530
00:41:39,722 --> 00:41:40,515
Hurry!

531
00:42:58,419 --> 00:43:02,060
Happy Halloween, trick or treat?

532
00:43:02,709 --> 00:43:05,609
lf you don't give me something good,
l'll do something bad.

533
00:43:06,036 --> 00:43:08,489
l'm smaller then what you know

534
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:10,827
l can't be seen by your eyes.

535
00:43:11,445 --> 00:43:13,352
Flesh and bones are also made from me.

536
00:43:14,295 --> 00:43:16,398
What does he mean?

537
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,430
l don't understand, but in biological terms,
there are a lot of meanings.

538
00:43:21,048 --> 00:43:23,380
Did you guys see an out of fashion hat?

539
00:43:23,928 --> 00:43:25,354
This is more important.

540
00:43:25,752 --> 00:43:27,823
There was a message from the bounty.

541
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,261
Maybe it's a trick.

542
00:43:29,752 --> 00:43:31,570
l would have thought the same way,

543
00:43:31,994 --> 00:43:33,517
if l hadn't seen what was in the pot.

544
00:43:33,882 --> 00:43:34,642
Pot?

545
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:39,445
From its appearance,
it looks like a lymphocyte.

546
00:43:39,899 --> 00:43:42,711
ln reality, it's made up of thousands
of tiny machines.

547
00:43:43,452 --> 00:43:45,970
These are what they call ''nano-machines.''

548
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:46,959
Nano-machines?

549
00:43:47,421 --> 00:43:48,400
l see...

550
00:43:48,764 --> 00:43:49,427
What do you know about it?

551
00:43:49,724 --> 00:43:50,288
Nothing.

552
00:43:51,164 --> 00:43:52,143
What was that?

553
00:43:52,669 --> 00:43:55,983
Well, it's a machine so small that
it can't be seen by human eyes.

554
00:43:56,414 --> 00:43:58,779
On top of that, they are made of proteins.

555
00:44:00,285 --> 00:44:02,519
Your favorite proteins.

556
00:44:03,102 --> 00:44:07,736
They can't be eaten, and are only used
for medical purposes...

557
00:44:08,157 --> 00:44:10,009
Why was that thing inside the pot?

558
00:44:11,424 --> 00:44:16,439
Anyway, lymphocytes aren't suppose
to be made of protein.

559
00:44:16,864 --> 00:44:17,657
And?

560
00:44:18,048 --> 00:44:21,394
Whoever wrote this message
knows exactly what this is.

561
00:44:21,793 --> 00:44:22,651
And?

562
00:44:23,296 --> 00:44:24,340
That's it.

563
00:44:24,865 --> 00:44:27,732
You have no idea what it is.

564
00:44:28,257 --> 00:44:30,109
This was a waste of time.

565
00:44:31,459 --> 00:44:33,277
How was the medical lab?

566
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,482
lt's one great place.

567
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:37,978
They make some powerful medicines there.

568
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:41,661
All of their guards are equipped with G-21s.

569
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:44,917
G-21s? Those are military issue machine guns!

570
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:47,777
The public can't buy them.

571
00:44:48,324 --> 00:44:50,907
There was a girl with
the same tattoo as Vincent.

572
00:44:52,004 --> 00:44:53,342
That girl...

573
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:55,233
What about her?

574
00:44:55,556 --> 00:44:56,730
She's pretty fine.

575
00:44:59,335 --> 00:45:00,444
Anyway...

576
00:45:00,838 --> 00:45:03,421
lf it involves the Army, the story changes a lot.

577
00:45:03,782 --> 00:45:07,609
Solving one mystery has only made
the whole thing more mysterious.

578
00:45:08,263 --> 00:45:11,043
Hey, what are you doing?

579
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,274
At times like this, it's best to sleep.

580
00:45:14,537 --> 00:45:15,516
Hey...

581
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,087
Treasures should sleep and wait.

582
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:19,651
Oh yeah, l forgot.

583
00:45:20,392 --> 00:45:21,795
l came here to look for a hat.

584
00:45:22,154 --> 00:45:22,783
Do you know anything about it?

585
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:23,874
No.

586
00:45:24,778 --> 00:45:26,149
Where did it go?

587
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,362
Smells weird...

588
00:45:32,042 --> 00:45:33,599
Do you know, Ein?

589
00:46:01,038 --> 00:46:02,245
l wonder if it's here.

590
00:46:07,793 --> 00:46:11,107
Trick or treat? Give me something
or l'll do a trick.

591
00:46:11,504 --> 00:46:13,706
Shut up! Halloween's tomorrow!

592
00:46:22,066 --> 00:46:23,273
That's not it.

593
00:46:26,226 --> 00:46:28,493
l'm going to do a trick.

594
00:46:29,715 --> 00:46:31,402
Oh really? Go ahead.

595
00:46:32,564 --> 00:46:33,771
Gimme!

596
00:46:34,194 --> 00:46:36,363
Maybe l should do a trick, little boy.

597
00:46:36,789 --> 00:46:37,680
l'm not a little boy.

598
00:46:40,021 --> 00:46:41,228
l'm a girl.

599
00:46:41,683 --> 00:46:45,063
What? l have no use for girls. Go home!

600
00:46:49,686 --> 00:46:50,927
lt's not this one either.

601
00:47:09,817 --> 00:47:10,762
Found him!

602
00:47:17,818 --> 00:47:19,059
Yes? Yes? Hello?

603
00:47:19,418 --> 00:47:20,625
Found him! l found him!

604
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:21,614
What?

605
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:22,989
Ed, what's going on?

606
00:47:23,354 --> 00:47:25,937
l found Lee! l found him!

607
00:47:26,202 --> 00:47:27,279
Great job.

608
00:47:27,738 --> 00:47:29,523
l always knew you weren't just an average kid.

609
00:47:29,882 --> 00:47:30,446
Where are you now?

610
00:47:30,844 --> 00:47:32,784
l'm sending you my current location.

611
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:37,199
Stay there and don't move. l'm on my way!

612
00:47:37,726 --> 00:47:38,967
Okay, got it.

613
00:47:39,324 --> 00:47:40,433
Bye bye!

614
00:47:48,126 --> 00:47:49,715
l finished level one.

615
00:47:50,109 --> 00:47:50,967
Easy as cake.

616
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:54,036
You're playing the same game?

617
00:47:54,654 --> 00:47:55,578
is it fun?

618
00:47:55,968 --> 00:47:57,012
What kind of game is it?

619
00:47:59,936 --> 00:48:02,651
She's just a little kid, damn it.

620
00:48:04,031 --> 00:48:07,858
Those morons... Which building?
Which room?

621
00:48:10,146 --> 00:48:13,919
ln solitaire,
every ball you jump gets taken away.

622
00:48:14,849 --> 00:48:17,629
Then, if you are left with
only one ball, you win.

623
00:48:18,179 --> 00:48:20,086
Ah, it's over.

624
00:48:20,482 --> 00:48:21,526
So you win?

625
00:48:25,411 --> 00:48:27,066
The game's climax is about to start.

626
00:48:28,259 --> 00:48:29,336
What are you talking about?

627
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,454
Wait a minute, is that ball...

628
00:48:35,877 --> 00:48:37,248
lt is only a game.

629
00:48:41,797 --> 00:48:43,103
lt can't be...

630
00:48:43,781 --> 00:48:47,095
You're kidding, right?

631
00:48:47,975 --> 00:48:50,112
There is only one left.

632
00:49:38,798 --> 00:49:40,485
l can't meet...

633
00:49:40,878 --> 00:49:43,364
Spooky... Donkey...

634
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:45,925
Hey!

635
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:47,782
lt's not good for me if you die!

636
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:48,968
Get up!

637
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:52,199
Please restart...

638
00:51:10,011 --> 00:51:11,600
Emergency call from Alpha One.

639
00:51:12,186 --> 00:51:13,808
We have located Humpty Dumpty.

640
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:17,303
Current location is 24 point one five.

641
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:18,768
He's moving.

642
00:51:19,132 --> 00:51:20,111
l'll come right over.

643
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:22,066
Don't do anything until l get there.

644
00:51:22,654 --> 00:51:23,763
But l will.

645
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,226
He's entered between one seven
and one eight.

646
00:51:37,312 --> 00:51:38,967
He's heading towards the central station.

647
00:51:57,249 --> 00:51:59,101
This way! l'll go with you!

648
00:51:59,682 --> 00:52:00,889
l'll be fine alone.

649
00:52:01,315 --> 00:52:01,781
But...

650
00:52:02,114 --> 00:52:03,005
Take care of my car.

651
00:53:23,087 --> 00:53:23,782
Vincent!

652
00:53:25,677 --> 00:53:26,918
l don't know your face.

653
00:53:27,342 --> 00:53:31,715
but l can tell by your smell,
you reek of blood.

654
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,603
You're a bounty hunter?

655
00:53:35,055 --> 00:53:36,296
Don't think badly of me.

656
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:42,218
lt's your fault for getting
a 300,000,000 bounty put on your head.

657
00:54:25,815 --> 00:54:26,739
Why don't you shoot?

658
00:54:27,224 --> 00:54:27,853
What?

659
00:54:28,469 --> 00:54:29,229
What's wrong?

660
00:54:29,782 --> 00:54:31,371
You only talk at the start?

661
00:54:33,847 --> 00:54:34,891
Do it.

662
00:54:35,353 --> 00:54:36,298
l won't kill you.

663
00:54:36,761 --> 00:54:38,164
l don't want to lose the bounty.

664
00:54:39,255 --> 00:54:40,910
l do not fear death.

665
00:54:41,561 --> 00:54:43,599
You quietly watch a dream.

666
00:54:44,601 --> 00:54:46,966
A dream that continues forever.

667
00:54:49,178 --> 00:54:50,833
What a messed up guy.

668
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,358
ls that all?

669
00:56:42,314 --> 00:56:43,521
What is your name?

670
00:56:44,363 --> 00:56:46,816
Spike...Spiegal.

671
00:56:48,362 --> 00:56:50,499
l'll meet you at the end of this world.

672
00:56:50,732 --> 00:56:51,656
Vincent!

673
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,221
Vincent...

674
00:57:30,736 --> 00:57:33,483
You...about me...

675
00:58:10,455 --> 00:58:11,281
Why?

676
00:58:22,873 --> 00:58:24,334
Vincent...

677
00:58:50,502 --> 00:58:51,840
You know what, Spike?

678
00:58:54,052 --> 00:58:55,870
That was a close call.

679
00:58:58,114 --> 00:58:59,517
He died.

680
00:59:00,131 --> 00:59:02,616
No. He was already dead.

681
00:59:05,023 --> 00:59:06,481
Just like you.

682
00:59:28,918 --> 00:59:32,712
The man who sank his body in the river.

683
00:59:33,204 --> 00:59:35,340
His eyes found you.

684
00:59:41,363 --> 00:59:42,472
Thanks.

685
00:59:45,585 --> 00:59:47,142
What did you see?

686
00:59:47,567 --> 00:59:49,604
Your eyes are half closed.

687
00:59:52,078 --> 00:59:54,246
l was... watching a dream.

688
00:59:57,612 --> 01:00:01,635
l never knew what a dream was,

689
01:00:02,378 --> 01:00:07,260
and for the first time l tasted fear.

690
01:00:09,224 --> 01:00:12,482
Just a little something was off.

691
01:00:13,765 --> 01:00:15,223
l was dead.

692
01:00:17,381 --> 01:00:21,501
lt wasn't a good day for you to die.

693
01:00:26,688 --> 01:00:29,074
A swimming bird.

694
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,113
Those blue dreams see through everything.

695
01:00:33,439 --> 01:00:35,291
The past, the future,

696
01:00:35,805 --> 01:00:37,362
and also now.

697
01:00:38,493 --> 01:00:42,352
Everything flows and everything is connected.

698
01:00:42,843 --> 01:00:45,589
These eyes aren't looking at reality.

699
01:00:46,073 --> 01:00:48,525
lt's feeling the truth.

700
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:52,490
Open the true eyes.

701
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,762
You have nothing to fear.

702
01:00:57,941 --> 01:01:01,648
Yeah, l know...

703
01:01:20,526 --> 01:01:22,148
Seems like you're alive.

704
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,231
What about him?

705
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:29,596
Vincent...

706
01:01:30,856 --> 01:01:32,162
He disappeared,

707
01:01:32,777 --> 01:01:35,294
as though he was never here.

708
01:01:38,086 --> 01:01:41,399
We put ourselves in great danger.

709
01:01:42,724 --> 01:01:43,833
Yeah.

710
01:01:44,228 --> 01:01:46,298
My father use to say this:

711
01:01:46,564 --> 01:01:51,795
A ship that goes out to sea either
goes on sailing or sinks.

712
01:01:53,152 --> 01:01:59,670
We're only bounty hunters.
This is something that we can't handle.

713
01:02:00,446 --> 01:02:02,582
We can still get out now.

714
01:02:02,908 --> 01:02:04,880
Our involvement in this case is over.

715
01:02:05,245 --> 01:02:06,224
Alright, Spike?

716
01:02:07,834 --> 01:02:08,845
Hey...

717
01:02:13,658 --> 01:02:15,158
You sure do sleep a lot.

718
01:02:24,153 --> 01:02:26,028
Don't you want to answer?

719
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:33,316
Because of your selfish act, doesn't it feel
like it's your fault for this incident?

720
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:36,436
l'm sorry, sir.

721
01:02:36,868 --> 01:02:38,866
l'll be asking you not to do anything for a while.

722
01:02:39,835 --> 01:02:41,871
We'll give you further information later.

723
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:43,689
You're excused.

724
01:02:51,779 --> 01:02:53,146
Watch her.

725
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:54,486
Yes, sir.

726
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:59,654
From the victim's body, the monorail incident,
and the tanker accident,

727
01:03:00,088 --> 01:03:03,043
That is the same

728
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:06,977
What does the analysis of the substance tell us?

729
01:03:07,494 --> 01:03:09,013
lt's currently being researched.

730
01:03:09,505 --> 01:03:12,689
The virus itself acts like nothing we've seen before.

731
01:03:13,085 --> 01:03:17,677
A hacker named Lee created it.

732
01:03:18,033 --> 01:03:20,548
We're investigating his hack routes and information.

733
01:03:21,162 --> 01:03:24,528
ls there a possibility that he's already dead?

734
01:03:25,278 --> 01:03:28,845
There's a possibility that this has something
to do with a terrorist group.

735
01:03:29,403 --> 01:03:31,017
What are their motives?

736
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:33,917
A random killing? Or is it for money?

737
01:03:35,757 --> 01:03:37,468
That's being looked into.

738
01:03:37,988 --> 01:03:41,182
So, basically everything
is under analysis or investigation?

739
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:43,442
How long are you going to keep us waiting?

740
01:03:43,865 --> 01:03:46,610
The physical exam results will be ready in 12 hours.

741
01:04:02,163 --> 01:04:07,998
ls it my imagination, or does my leg feel heavy?

742
01:04:09,476 --> 01:04:11,675
He's been found.

743
01:04:14,711 --> 01:04:19,015
A circle is a tadpole.

744
01:04:19,602 --> 01:04:21,216
a circle is very beautiful

745
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:22,748
Even black grapes taste

746
01:04:23,182 --> 01:04:25,726
very, very sweet.

747
01:04:26,081 --> 01:04:26,844
l found it.

748
01:04:27,269 --> 01:04:28,664
Cherious Medical...

749
01:04:29,155 --> 01:04:32,110
Search for a truck delivery made on October 15 th.

750
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:34,185
Alright.

751
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:36,197
Spike, just to let you know...

752
01:04:36,591 --> 01:04:38,522
l know. l'm just researching.

753
01:04:39,269 --> 01:04:40,854
l can't sleep because l'm really curious.

754
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,330
You sleep too much.

755
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,404
Truck...truck, Cargo...cargo.

756
01:04:55,826 --> 01:04:58,471
Macademia nuts inside!

757
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,179
Macademia nuts?

758
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,317
Most likely an undible seed.

759
01:05:02,701 --> 01:05:04,128
Search!

760
01:05:05,013 --> 01:05:06,795
Macadamia Nuts Surveillance Group.

761
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:09,222
Macadamia Nuts Research and Development.

762
01:05:09,969 --> 01:05:12,423
That's an awful lot of power for just a seed.

763
01:05:12,981 --> 01:05:15,368
Ed, go to Macadamia Nuts Research
and Development.

764
01:05:15,723 --> 01:05:16,969
Alright.

765
01:05:18,993 --> 01:05:20,901
Can you find out what they were doing in this area?

766
01:05:25,034 --> 01:05:28,265
Ed's hacking program has been destroyed.

767
01:05:28,553 --> 01:05:29,348
What?

768
01:05:29,742 --> 01:05:30,566
When you've come so far?

769
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:33,864
Use another route to find out
about this guy, Ed.

770
01:05:34,191 --> 01:05:35,465
Alright.

771
01:05:38,382 --> 01:05:40,385
Doctor Mendel Alphedia.

772
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,846
Ex-SlT Professor and the first to research nano-machines.

773
01:05:44,394 --> 01:05:45,534
As we thought,

774
01:05:45,967 --> 01:05:47,241
that's not a normal water plant.

775
01:05:47,692 --> 01:05:49,925
They're making nano-machine weaponry in secret.

776
01:05:50,349 --> 01:05:53,349
Now Vincent, who's dead, brought it out.

777
01:05:54,155 --> 01:05:58,852
ln the military,
using nano-machines was forbidden.

778
01:05:59,592 --> 01:06:03,686
lf he's going to try something with it,
the military won't be sitting around.

779
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:07,166
He's still alive...

780
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:33,143
Steve...

781
01:06:33,508 --> 01:06:34,236
Hey Electra.

782
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:35,607
Need something?

783
01:06:40,613 --> 01:06:41,590
What's this?

784
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:42,722
Someone's blood?

785
01:06:43,873 --> 01:06:45,176
l want you to research this in private.

786
01:06:46,175 --> 01:06:48,830
Then you'll accept my date?

787
01:06:49,349 --> 01:06:49,913
Eh?

788
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:53,404
Alright.

789
01:06:53,855 --> 01:06:56,443
Good, reserve your Halloween dinner.

790
01:07:26,937 --> 01:07:28,049
What's going on?

791
01:07:30,264 --> 01:07:32,056
Why am l still alive?

792
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:35,605
What did you do to me?

793
01:07:37,687 --> 01:07:39,662
l gave you my blood.

794
01:07:41,531 --> 01:07:44,752
Now, you can live even if
the world goes wild.

795
01:07:45,588 --> 01:07:46,929
Just like me...

796
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,985
That time will soon come.

797
01:07:58,772 --> 01:08:00,334
Did you find what you wanted?

798
01:08:06,577 --> 01:08:07,372
Nope.

799
01:08:07,795 --> 01:08:08,974
l didn't want any of them.

800
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:11,314
The world is just like that.

801
01:08:12,724 --> 01:08:15,724
People often make stuff we don't want.

802
01:08:16,723 --> 01:08:18,314
That one that someone made...

803
01:08:18,708 --> 01:08:19,954
The demon...

804
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:25,514
Why did you give something like that to me?

805
01:08:26,157 --> 01:08:27,853
Because, the pot was meant for you.

806
01:08:28,623 --> 01:08:29,457
The present inside...

807
01:08:29,936 --> 01:08:33,608
A nano-machine shaped like a lymphocyte.

808
01:08:34,059 --> 01:08:35,275
Dr. Mendal...

809
01:08:40,819 --> 01:08:44,807
A man came to this town three years ago.

810
01:08:45,901 --> 01:08:50,052
He said to himself,
l've made something horrible.

811
01:08:51,406 --> 01:08:57,034
lt's designed to be transferred physically,
or aerobically.

812
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:02,211
Then, it goes into the blood
and creates more of itself.

813
01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:05,884
lt moves onto a lymphocyte,
and moves wherever it pleases.

814
01:09:06,277 --> 01:09:08,319
lt gets into the brain and destroys it.

815
01:09:08,877 --> 01:09:12,184
Then it destroys itself and becomes protein.

816
01:09:12,616 --> 01:09:14,792
lt doesn't leave any trail behind.

817
01:09:15,368 --> 01:09:17,755
That's what it's programmed to do.

818
01:09:18,599 --> 01:09:21,944
l just want to know one thing.

819
01:09:23,202 --> 01:09:25,473
Why is Vincent alive?

820
01:09:30,594 --> 01:09:32,703
Why did you do this?

821
01:09:34,181 --> 01:09:35,043
For the money?

822
01:09:35,562 --> 01:09:37,047
Some sort of revenge?

823
01:09:37,509 --> 01:09:40,125
Or are you having fun?

824
01:09:40,931 --> 01:09:43,614
l'm just looking...

825
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:45,054
Looking for a door.

826
01:09:45,831 --> 01:09:47,230
A door?

827
01:09:47,653 --> 01:09:51,095
l was dreaming, and l knew it was a dream.

828
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,107
l didn't wake up though.

829
01:09:53,953 --> 01:09:56,023
Have you experienced that before?

830
01:09:57,702 --> 01:10:01,786
From that time, when l was on Titan,

831
01:10:02,181 --> 01:10:03,666
it's been like that always.

832
01:10:05,124 --> 01:10:07,318
Vincent was an experiment.

833
01:10:08,068 --> 01:10:12,401
He put anti-nano-machines in his blood.

834
01:10:13,822 --> 01:10:15,959
Anti-nano-machines?

835
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,778
Just like the other nano-machines,
it spreads and creates more of itself.

836
01:10:19,834 --> 01:10:21,463
lt kills the others, though.

837
01:10:22,528 --> 01:10:24,503
ln other words, he was an experimental vaccine.

838
01:10:25,817 --> 01:10:29,911
The man who was supposed to stop
the unstoppable became unstoppable.

839
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:33,237
l don't know Vincent's true objective.

840
01:10:34,016 --> 01:10:35,991
He may not even have one.

841
01:10:36,413 --> 01:10:40,535
Maybe he'll just wait until the end of
the Earth to receive his judgment.

842
01:10:42,809 --> 01:10:45,522
Doesn't Dr, Mendal have everything?

843
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,695
The nano-machines and the vaccine?

844
01:10:49,588 --> 01:10:54,573
He erased all the data and left the military.

845
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:57,689
He didn't have any use for
a vaccine since there was no virus.

846
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:59,540
So he thought...

847
01:11:00,759 --> 01:11:03,174
That man is no longer here.

848
01:11:03,416 --> 01:11:04,307
He doesn't exist.

849
01:11:05,265 --> 01:11:08,563
No one can stop Vincent now.

850
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,203
l lost two things on Titan.

851
01:11:13,684 --> 01:11:15,543
One was my past.

852
01:11:17,971 --> 01:11:21,902
At that time, l had no friends or enemies.

853
01:11:22,775 --> 01:11:27,472
ln the nano-machine experiments,
everyone was killed.

854
01:11:28,048 --> 01:11:30,502
l was sent as a guinea pig.

855
01:11:31,088 --> 01:11:32,515
Just myself to live on,

856
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:37,541
but l've lost my memories

857
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:41,730
l don't even know who l was

858
01:11:44,082 --> 01:11:46,057
What's the other one?

859
01:11:46,546 --> 01:11:48,108
l saw a butterfly.

860
01:11:50,094 --> 01:11:52,298
l saw many butterflies.

861
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:56,939
Butterflies that were unimaginable.

862
01:12:04,401 --> 01:12:08,111
When the nano-machine reaches the brain,
it seems you can see a light.

863
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:10,661
As though they were...

864
01:12:11,726 --> 01:12:14,851
The world's most beautiful butterflies.

865
01:12:24,488 --> 01:12:26,280
l think l've said too much.

866
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:32,294
Rachido, will you give this to the doctor?

867
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:38,631
lf l see you once more...

868
01:12:39,016 --> 01:12:42,755
Let's leave it at that.

869
01:12:48,394 --> 01:12:50,876
Goodbye.

870
01:13:10,275 --> 01:13:11,415
Can you explain this?

871
01:13:11,877 --> 01:13:12,701
Commander?

872
01:13:13,123 --> 01:13:16,219
The one who should explain is you, Corporal.

873
01:13:16,768 --> 01:13:20,382
About the anti-nano-machines in your blood.

874
01:13:21,888 --> 01:13:24,533
Rumors spread around and fast.

875
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:29,970
Why is something that only Vincent
had in his blood now in yours?

876
01:13:30,691 --> 01:13:32,473
Did you come in contact with Vincent?

877
01:13:34,306 --> 01:13:37,172
For hiding information,
you'll be arrested.

878
01:13:37,594 --> 01:13:39,961
Commander! lf there's a vaccine inside me,

879
01:13:40,289 --> 01:13:42,771
We can produce more and give it
to the civilians!

880
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,207
You don't seem to understand.

881
01:13:46,397 --> 01:13:52,206
Our goal is to destroy everything that
has to do with the nano-machines.

882
01:13:52,926 --> 01:13:56,300
lf it's not there, it shouldn't exist.

883
01:14:08,892 --> 01:14:10,166
Hey.

884
01:14:16,439 --> 01:14:20,216
l wonder what kind of relation
we have with them.

885
01:14:21,972 --> 01:14:24,397
lt's not that l want
to be protective of my friends

886
01:14:24,887 --> 01:14:27,024
l don't have those kind of relationships.

887
01:14:27,639 --> 01:14:31,627
Everyone just does whatever
they want and comes back,

888
01:14:32,116 --> 01:14:34,483
and l'm being swung around all the time.

889
01:14:35,157 --> 01:14:38,982
l've had it with this,
l miss the days when l was alone.

890
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:48,043
One more move and l would have won.

891
01:14:55,216 --> 01:14:56,711
Hey! No! Ein!

892
01:15:05,524 --> 01:15:07,373
l wouldn't care...

893
01:15:07,787 --> 01:15:09,800
l wouldn't care if they come home or not.

894
01:15:10,769 --> 01:15:12,618
Just like the bet.

895
01:15:13,838 --> 01:15:18,094
l told myself that if the coin
toss was tails, l'd date you.

896
01:15:18,833 --> 01:15:21,997
Well, this isn't a great place for a date...

897
01:15:23,627 --> 01:15:24,642
Aren't you afraid?

898
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:26,148
Afraid?

899
01:15:27,243 --> 01:15:31,135
By the time we get out,
we'll lose our memories or be killed.

900
01:15:32,555 --> 01:15:35,306
Either, way, our daily life will be removed.

901
01:15:36,745 --> 01:15:39,237
Even if you're alive, it's like you're dead.

902
01:15:39,622 --> 01:15:40,771
Like Vincent?

903
01:15:42,988 --> 01:15:45,882
lf you're still alive even after
the monorail incident,

904
01:15:46,373 --> 01:15:51,358
it's in your body too, The vaccine...

905
01:15:52,164 --> 01:15:53,380
You seem to know everything.

906
01:15:53,958 --> 01:15:55,482
lt's just like you said:

907
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:00,064
Knowing too much shortens your life span.

908
01:16:01,926 --> 01:16:05,789
You're notjust an average bounty hunter,
Spike Spiegel.

909
01:16:06,471 --> 01:16:09,883
lt's waste of time,
just calling yourself a military unit.

910
01:16:10,153 --> 01:16:13,527
My name is Electra Obilwon,

911
01:16:14,209 --> 01:16:15,263
Figures...

912
01:16:16,002 --> 01:16:17,689
Your name sounds strong.

913
01:16:24,929 --> 01:16:29,023
l never knew that l had something
like this inside me.

914
01:16:35,582 --> 01:16:41,363
Vincent is... That man has been all
alone since he was born.

915
01:16:42,783 --> 01:16:46,167
From his youth, the only thing anyone
gave him was honour and hatred.

916
01:16:47,137 --> 01:16:48,919
No one ever loved him.

917
01:16:51,068 --> 01:16:54,097
That's why l wanted to save him.

918
01:16:55,326 --> 01:16:57,214
l thought l could do it.

919
01:16:57,819 --> 01:17:01,500
lt was all a misunderstanding
on the monorail.

920
01:17:01,856 --> 01:17:06,870
Vincent looked at me as though
he was looking at a stranger.

921
01:17:08,664 --> 01:17:11,252
l was already gone from his memories.

922
01:17:13,784 --> 01:17:15,308
You loved him?

923
01:17:17,112 --> 01:17:18,521
l don't know.

924
01:17:20,123 --> 01:17:24,590
l didn't realize those feelings
were inside me.

925
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:28,397
l didn't know, and l lost myself.

926
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:29,806
My heart was aching, and it hurt.

927
01:17:30,133 --> 01:17:31,148
Have you ever experienced anything similar?

928
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:33,748
Of course,

929
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:40,181
Maybe the one that wanted to be saved was me.

930
01:17:40,882 --> 01:17:42,061
Long ago...

931
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:44,688
l was younger then...

932
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:48,783
l wasn't afraid of anything.

933
01:17:49,752 --> 01:17:52,848
l didn't think about dying for a second.

934
01:17:53,904 --> 01:17:56,396
l thought l was invincible.

935
01:17:57,845 --> 01:18:00,327
Then l met some girl.

936
01:18:00,722 --> 01:18:02,668
l wanted to live.

937
01:18:03,062 --> 01:18:04,241
l started to think like that.

938
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:07,721
For the first time, l was afraid of death.

939
01:18:08,595 --> 01:18:10,598
l'd never felt it before.

940
01:18:13,648 --> 01:18:15,948
Where's that person now?

941
01:18:16,208 --> 01:18:17,703
Gone somewhere...

942
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:21,672
lt's amazing.

943
01:18:22,258 --> 01:18:24,903
You're the first person l've ever told this to.

944
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,121
Why are you after Vincent?

945
01:18:30,448 --> 01:18:32,585
He smells just like me.

946
01:18:34,475 --> 01:18:37,255
So l want to meet him.

947
01:18:56,903 --> 01:19:00,930
That man, he's called Spike or something?

948
01:19:03,884 --> 01:19:06,750
So he is your friend.

949
01:19:07,652 --> 01:19:08,868
What do you know?

950
01:19:09,704 --> 01:19:11,429
What are you going to start?

951
01:19:12,198 --> 01:19:14,719
l came here to end it.

952
01:19:16,426 --> 01:19:18,756
The last party is about to start.

953
01:19:20,166 --> 01:19:23,166
The next trick is a special type
of nano-machine.

954
01:19:24,097 --> 01:19:26,973
lt doesn't destroy itself,
it continues to reproduce,

955
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:29,466
Soon the world...

956
01:19:29,831 --> 01:19:32,189
Taking the world with you?

957
01:19:33,091 --> 01:19:36,024
You're insane.

958
01:19:36,677 --> 01:19:38,201
Do you think so?

959
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:42,650
No one can draw a line
between sane and insane.

960
01:19:43,649 --> 01:19:46,515
You have to change the border
when you think it's right.

961
01:19:46,919 --> 01:19:47,857
No one else can.

962
01:19:48,357 --> 01:19:49,977
You'll understand soon,

963
01:19:51,301 --> 01:19:54,608
the one that's insane is the world.

964
01:19:56,354 --> 01:19:57,494
Do you want to come with me?

965
01:20:00,353 --> 01:20:02,395
The only ones left will be you and me.

966
01:20:03,172 --> 01:20:04,504
You've got to be kidding.

967
01:20:05,022 --> 01:20:09,394
l don't know what the world's going to be,
but l'd rather not live with you.

968
01:20:23,452 --> 01:20:25,398
You should live all by yourself
for an eternity.

969
01:20:38,324 --> 01:20:39,090
Vincent!

970
01:20:39,513 --> 01:20:40,970
l told you not to come here.

971
01:20:42,649 --> 01:20:44,624
l finished installing inside the jacks.

972
01:20:45,277 --> 01:20:46,417
l want to go now.

973
01:20:46,773 --> 01:20:48,182
The police are starting to get suspicious.

974
01:20:48,728 --> 01:20:50,482
So can you give me the rest of the money?

975
01:20:50,838 --> 01:20:51,920
Did you pray?

976
01:21:10,226 --> 01:21:12,497
The bridge that connects
the Earth and the Heavens.

977
01:21:12,758 --> 01:21:14,215
That's where l am.

978
01:21:14,963 --> 01:21:16,938
The only one in the world.

979
01:21:17,303 --> 01:21:19,239
You can watch as l do it.

980
01:21:31,984 --> 01:21:33,325
What's going to happen to me?

981
01:21:34,064 --> 01:21:36,997
lf you're a soldier,
you should be prepared,

982
01:21:41,803 --> 01:21:43,634
Can you give me a cigarette?

983
01:21:44,075 --> 01:21:45,224
You can at least spare one right?

984
01:21:45,647 --> 01:21:46,729
Doesn't matter if you do.

985
01:21:52,235 --> 01:21:53,250
Wait!

986
01:21:53,453 --> 01:21:54,565
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

987
01:21:54,930 --> 01:21:55,821
Throw down your weapon,

988
01:21:56,177 --> 01:21:57,289
Open the door, Harris,

989
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,126
l'll be taking one.

990
01:22:06,666 --> 01:22:08,075
So where is it?

991
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:09,706
lt's a water plant.

992
01:22:10,157 --> 01:22:14,346
We were investigating,
and found Lee's hacking trace.

993
01:22:15,018 --> 01:22:18,843
l understand, they're going to put it in
the water and spread throughout the city.

994
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,674
Send men out to post a guard.

995
01:22:21,127 --> 01:22:21,826
Yes sir!

996
01:22:23,303 --> 01:22:24,730
Just watch

997
01:22:25,451 --> 01:22:30,752
Sir, we should get permission from the department,
in case something happens later.

998
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:33,628
This is a no-smoking facility.

999
01:22:35,337 --> 01:22:39,297
Even if you act well,
nothing will ever get solved!

1000
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:49,441
Lets take a little side trip.

1001
01:22:49,893 --> 01:22:50,650
What?

1002
01:22:51,014 --> 01:22:52,193
Where's your blood?

1003
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:57,755
This way...

1004
01:23:01,026 --> 01:23:01,888
lt's open.

1005
01:23:02,982 --> 01:23:03,901
Put the containment suits on.

1006
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:04,986
There's no use.

1007
01:23:05,475 --> 01:23:06,423
They'll be following us soon.

1008
01:23:10,912 --> 01:23:12,321
Where's Electra's vaccine?

1009
01:23:13,376 --> 01:23:17,153
lt's inside the third case, No, the second.

1010
01:23:18,084 --> 01:23:18,648
This?

1011
01:23:19,043 --> 01:23:19,502
Yes.

1012
01:23:19,935 --> 01:23:21,181
The yellow packs inside.

1013
01:23:23,387 --> 01:23:24,316
lt's true.

1014
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:27,164
Just that the whole production isn't over yet.

1015
01:23:28,028 --> 01:23:31,287
ln 20 hours, every pack will contain
about 10,000 of them.

1016
01:23:35,037 --> 01:23:36,311
Electra, l'm sorry.

1017
01:23:37,694 --> 01:23:39,736
You should take the level 3 disposal path.

1018
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:42,266
Thanks.

1019
01:23:45,144 --> 01:23:46,571
l have to wait until another time for my date?

1020
01:24:35,572 --> 01:24:36,463
Hey you!

1021
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:39,655
We are lSSP, We are going to be borrowing this place.

1022
01:24:40,501 --> 01:24:41,613
We didn't hear anything about that!

1023
01:24:42,543 --> 01:24:44,038
We'd like for you to help us.

1024
01:24:48,661 --> 01:24:51,815
l don't think l can show myself like this to people.

1025
01:24:55,949 --> 01:24:57,358
Please go to Heaven.

1026
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:03,532
Are you waiting for a phone call?

1027
01:25:03,954 --> 01:25:05,190
No, not really.

1028
01:25:06,381 --> 01:25:08,806
So you're not waiting for
Spike or Faye's phone call?

1029
01:25:10,284 --> 01:25:11,396
Come to think of it, l don't see them.

1030
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,351
l didn't really notice.

1031
01:25:16,142 --> 01:25:16,899
Hello?

1032
01:25:17,293 --> 01:25:18,634
Vincent left.

1033
01:25:19,757 --> 01:25:21,444
Where have you been all this time?

1034
01:25:22,058 --> 01:25:23,620
He seems like he's going to go all out.

1035
01:25:24,264 --> 01:25:25,730
Seems like there's going to be a big party.

1036
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:27,591
How do you know about this?

1037
01:25:28,588 --> 01:25:32,442
Spike? You moron,
Where have you been all this time. Huh?

1038
01:25:33,709 --> 01:25:35,903
The lSSP seems to have gone to a water plant.

1039
01:25:36,519 --> 01:25:37,668
Water plant?

1040
01:26:05,956 --> 01:26:08,227
Squad 4: Completed analyzing gate number 2.

1041
01:26:08,833 --> 01:26:11,613
Squad 2: There's nothing like it in tank 3.

1042
01:26:12,132 --> 01:26:15,544
Squad 3: There's something suspicious
at the entrance to plant 4.

1043
01:26:16,897 --> 01:26:17,883
Good, we'll be sending a analysis group.

1044
01:26:18,144 --> 01:26:18,747
What does it look like?

1045
01:26:19,103 --> 01:26:23,964
Well...it's a pumpkin-shaped balloon.

1046
01:26:28,643 --> 01:26:32,698
lsn't it weird to dress like a magician
to go to a water plant?

1047
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:36,611
To hide a leaf in a forest, eh?

1048
01:26:37,053 --> 01:26:41,281
He's going to do it inside the city?

1049
01:26:41,665 --> 01:26:42,556
How?

1050
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:45,941
His ally came and told him something about a jack,

1051
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:47,062
Jack?

1052
01:26:48,225 --> 01:26:49,394
l see...

1053
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:53,497
Jack-o-lantern.

1054
01:26:53,882 --> 01:26:55,703
Jack's Lantern...

1055
01:26:57,726 --> 01:26:58,962
We'll be starting the analysis.

1056
01:27:06,807 --> 01:27:08,234
Hey! What?

1057
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:15,533
What's going on?

1058
01:27:36,082 --> 01:27:37,577
All squads, report in.

1059
01:27:38,010 --> 01:27:38,834
Shit!

1060
01:27:39,189 --> 01:27:40,530
Go tell everyone below about the situation!

1061
01:27:40,982 --> 01:27:42,094
Yes sir.

1062
01:27:42,928 --> 01:27:43,665
Chief!

1063
01:27:43,955 --> 01:27:44,817
What's wrong?

1064
01:27:45,431 --> 01:27:46,638
These are the Marines!

1065
01:27:49,496 --> 01:27:50,415
Chief!

1066
01:27:52,374 --> 01:27:53,447
Who's in command?

1067
01:27:54,032 --> 01:27:56,169
l didn't hear about an Army movement.

1068
01:27:56,823 --> 01:27:58,097
This is an undercover investigation.

1069
01:27:59,824 --> 01:28:01,482
The Army will be taking over this area.

1070
01:28:01,876 --> 01:28:03,400
What? What kind of action is this?

1071
01:28:03,794 --> 01:28:04,771
l have no need to tell you.

1072
01:28:05,136 --> 01:28:05,931
What did you say?

1073
01:28:06,287 --> 01:28:07,053
The analysis is complete.

1074
01:28:11,341 --> 01:28:13,066
The results... tell me the results now!

1075
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:14,945
Didn't you hear me to stay out?

1076
01:28:15,311 --> 01:28:16,259
Shut up!

1077
01:28:16,653 --> 01:28:17,544
The substance is...

1078
01:28:17,899 --> 01:28:22,693
Oxygen, Carbon, Carbon Monoxide,
lron, Neon, and Krypton, Meaning...

1079
01:28:22,991 --> 01:28:25,224
lt's just air.

1080
01:28:31,276 --> 01:28:34,372
The place is all filled with people.

1081
01:28:35,121 --> 01:28:38,179
He said it himself, he's at a place
where Heaven and Earth are connected.

1082
01:28:38,573 --> 01:28:39,502
What did you say?

1083
01:28:39,943 --> 01:28:43,422
Jet, can you get a plane ready?
Like 20 or 30?

1084
01:28:43,655 --> 01:28:44,325
What?

1085
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:45,581
Where are you going?

1086
01:28:46,119 --> 01:28:47,652
l'll be going ahead with the Swordfish.

1087
01:28:48,334 --> 01:28:49,158
Hey wait!

1088
01:28:54,855 --> 01:28:56,925
Faye , can you go to
the Environment Control Center?

1089
01:28:57,414 --> 01:28:58,794
Hey wait!

1090
01:28:59,525 --> 01:29:01,538
He lives even if the world
doesn't exist anymore.

1091
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:03,004
We can't win against him.

1092
01:29:03,523 --> 01:29:05,085
l owe him something.

1093
01:29:05,479 --> 01:29:06,207
lt's impossible!

1094
01:29:07,243 --> 01:29:11,030
lf he just wanted to destroy the world,
he'd already have done it.

1095
01:29:11,463 --> 01:29:12,392
Huh?

1096
01:29:12,748 --> 01:29:13,888
This is an invitation from him.

1097
01:29:14,406 --> 01:29:16,255
lf there's no guests, there's no party.

1098
01:29:17,475 --> 01:29:21,051
Go, if you don't go, this won't work.

1099
01:29:22,758 --> 01:29:23,255
l'm counting on you.

1100
01:29:23,621 --> 01:29:24,378
Ah...

1101
01:29:25,127 --> 01:29:26,018
Damn it.

1102
01:29:26,919 --> 01:29:28,855
Morons never learn until they die.

1103
01:29:34,495 --> 01:29:35,329
Hmm?

1104
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:37,601
Damn Army doesn't have anything better to do.

1105
01:29:58,754 --> 01:30:01,112
l don't have time
to be playing with you guys.

1106
01:30:47,447 --> 01:30:48,587
lt's an emergency!

1107
01:30:49,048 --> 01:30:50,543
Can't you do something about it?

1108
01:30:50,899 --> 01:30:52,240
Even though you say so,

1109
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:57,227
all the fighter planes are rented
by a company and there are none left.

1110
01:30:57,784 --> 01:30:58,963
l don't have time.

1111
01:30:59,577 --> 01:31:01,264
l don't care what it is as long as it flies.

1112
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:05,646
Anything that flies?

1113
01:31:18,611 --> 01:31:20,519
l'm still early for the party.

1114
01:32:55,583 --> 01:32:58,650
Well, even old planes are good.

1115
01:32:59,677 --> 01:33:01,277
Do they actually fly?

1116
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:07,836
Leave it to us. All we have
to do is spread this around, right?

1117
01:33:08,221 --> 01:33:10,521
Talking badly about an old man isn't good.

1118
01:33:11,232 --> 01:33:12,861
Where are we going? Outer space?

1119
01:33:13,408 --> 01:33:14,615
You moron...

1120
01:33:15,106 --> 01:33:16,793
We're spraying pesticides,
why would we go into space?

1121
01:33:17,339 --> 01:33:19,860
To the city! To Aruba City!

1122
01:33:20,706 --> 01:33:21,750
We already know that...

1123
01:33:22,106 --> 01:33:23,255
We were just joking.

1124
01:33:41,053 --> 01:33:43,085
Wow, they actually flew.

1125
01:33:43,738 --> 01:33:44,562
What?

1126
01:33:44,985 --> 01:33:49,213
l don't know about the engines,
l haven't flown them in ages.

1127
01:35:09,741 --> 01:35:11,716
Hey you old piece of shit!

1128
01:35:20,077 --> 01:35:22,281
Huh?

1129
01:35:38,535 --> 01:35:39,809
Hey, taxi.

1130
01:35:42,217 --> 01:35:43,741
Who's in charge?

1131
01:35:45,257 --> 01:35:46,436
Who are you?

1132
01:35:47,626 --> 01:35:51,298
Can't you tell? l'm an average terrorist,

1133
01:35:55,335 --> 01:35:56,993
What are you going
to do at a place like this?

1134
01:35:57,569 --> 01:35:58,815
What do you want?

1135
01:35:59,266 --> 01:36:00,378
l want you to make it rain.

1136
01:36:02,019 --> 01:36:04,022
What? Why?

1137
01:36:04,454 --> 01:36:07,070
Lets see... because it's a party.

1138
01:37:29,364 --> 01:37:31,310
Ah, this isn't good.

1139
01:37:32,567 --> 01:37:35,212
The roads are packed
because of the parade,

1140
01:37:39,864 --> 01:37:42,855
The bridge that connects
the Heavens and Earth...

1141
01:37:46,931 --> 01:37:49,452
Hey, wait, the taxi fee!

1142
01:38:57,542 --> 01:38:58,969
Did the party already start?

1143
01:39:01,925 --> 01:39:03,352
Just now...

1144
01:39:10,276 --> 01:39:14,236
l remember when we shot down
those old planes...

1145
01:39:14,630 --> 01:39:20,094
We're almost there. Get ready.

1146
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:10,551
l knew you'd come, bounty hunter.

1147
01:40:11,194 --> 01:40:14,645
l barely missed killing you.

1148
01:40:15,864 --> 01:40:18,519
lt looks like that eye
isn't just an ornament.

1149
01:41:24,109 --> 01:41:26,409
Did you come to save the world?

1150
01:41:27,503 --> 01:41:29,602
You're too late.

1151
01:41:30,322 --> 01:41:33,965
Too bad, l'm a bounty hunter.

1152
01:41:34,378 --> 01:41:36,803
l don't care what happens
to the world.

1153
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:40,897
l just came here to pay back the debt.

1154
01:41:41,550 --> 01:41:43,007
Do you think l'm joking?

1155
01:41:43,564 --> 01:41:44,838
l'll really do it.

1156
01:41:45,195 --> 01:41:46,277
Do it.

1157
01:43:30,585 --> 01:43:33,681
Before you depart this world,
can you show me something?

1158
01:43:34,814 --> 01:43:37,527
l'm already dead from Titan,

1159
01:43:38,458 --> 01:43:41,305
and this world the butterflies
are showing me...

1160
01:43:41,593 --> 01:43:42,963
ls it a dream?

1161
01:43:44,604 --> 01:43:48,525
Or is their world the real one,

1162
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:51,862
and the world where l was the dream?

1163
01:43:53,915 --> 01:43:55,697
l don't know.

1164
01:43:56,667 --> 01:43:58,354
Vincent!

1165
01:44:01,299 --> 01:44:03,820
l won't let you get away!

1166
01:44:08,433 --> 01:44:11,980
Electra, don't.

1167
01:44:12,854 --> 01:44:15,720
Let's go, together.

1168
01:44:28,752 --> 01:44:30,161
Vincent!

1169
01:44:34,390 --> 01:44:37,352
Why didn't you shoot?

1170
01:44:39,692 --> 01:44:41,638
l remembered

1171
01:44:42,156 --> 01:44:44,293
l wanted to get out of there.

1172
01:44:46,989 --> 01:44:50,949
l wanted to find a door to do it.

1173
01:44:51,342 --> 01:44:56,769
l finally know now.

1174
01:44:57,354 --> 01:45:00,134
There was no door.

1175
01:45:01,354 --> 01:45:03,491
You should have known before.

1176
01:45:03,952 --> 01:45:07,211
You were afraid to open your eyes.

1177
01:45:07,979 --> 01:45:09,704
Yes...

1178
01:45:10,060 --> 01:45:11,517
Electra, from the time l lived,

1179
01:45:11,949 --> 01:45:17,691
Being with you was
the only time that felt real.

1180
01:45:22,315 --> 01:45:27,166
lt's good to meet you before l go.

1181
01:45:46,661 --> 01:45:48,002
What did the rain do?

1182
01:45:48,962 --> 01:45:52,221
Before the nano-machine could spread,
the rain made the vaccine spread faster.

1183
01:45:52,769 --> 01:45:55,261
lt was a blessing.

1184
01:45:56,163 --> 01:45:58,617
After the rain, there's a rainbow.

1185
01:45:59,845 --> 01:46:03,037
Hey! Wanna go see some horses?

1186
01:46:06,050 --> 01:46:08,437
You'll never get tired of that.

1187
01:49:49,307 --> 01:49:50,322
all alone.

1188
01:49:51,138 --> 01:49:55,155
He couldn't enjoy a game with anyone else.

1189
01:49:55,521 --> 01:49:59,710
Like living inside a dream...

1190
01:50:01,504 --> 01:50:03,286
That's the kind of man he was.

1191
01:50:12,186 --> 01:50:18,226
ARE YOU LlVlNG lN THE REAL WORLD
