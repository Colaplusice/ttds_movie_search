1
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,100
THREE COLORS
BLUE

2
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,730
Hurry, Anna.

3
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,500
Get back in.

4
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,150
Are you able to talk?

5
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,270
During the...
were you conscious?

6
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,150
I'm sorry to have to inform you...

7
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,430
Do you know?

8
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,860
Your husband...

9
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,779
died in the accident.

10
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,060
You must have been unconscious.

11
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,699
Anna?

12
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,819
Yes, your daughter too.

13
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,620
Is someone there?
Who did that?

14
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,860
Mr. Leroy,

15
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,110
call the head of the ward.

16
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,779
Someone broke a window
in the corridor on the first floor.

17
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:35,100
Come right away.

18
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:39,300
I'll look in the garden.

19
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,350
I can't... I'm unable to...

20
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,459
I broke the window.

21
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:46,850
Don't worry.

22
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,490
I'm sorry.

23
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:51,860
We'll replace it.

24
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,819
I'm sorry.

25
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,420
Don't worry.

26
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,300
Is it today?

27
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,170
This afternoon. At five o'clock.

28
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,829
Can I do anything for you?

29
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,110
We are gathered here
to pay our last respects

30
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,990
to a man,

31
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:30,789
a composer that the entire world

32
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,110
considered one of the greatest.

33
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,149
No one

34
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,509
can accept that he is gone.

35
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,389
We also mourn
his five year-old daughter

36
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,470
who died by his side.

37
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,230
Patrice,

38
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,190
millions of men

39
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,340
and women

40
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,549
awaited the music you composed

41
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,509
for the Unification of Europe,

42
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,269
which we all hope to celebrate soon.

43
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:06,649
Hello.

44
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,779
Hello.

45
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,110
I know you don't want to see me.

46
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,269
You're right.

47
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,950
- Can I come in?
- No.

48
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,110
Julie...
it's not for an interview.

49
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,019
What then?

50
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,539
I'm writing an article
about your husband.

51
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,879
- I need to know something.
- About what?

52
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,789
The concert
for the Unification of Europe.

53
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,230
It doesn't exist.

54
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,629
You've changed.

55
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,179
You weren't so rude before.

56
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,590
Haven't you heard?

57
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,909
I had an accident.
I lost my daughter and my husband.

58
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:11,470
Is it true you wrote
your husband's music?

59
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,509
Hello!

60
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,230
Bernard?

61
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,740
Hello, ma'am.

62
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,870
Did you do what I asked?

63
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,909
- You cleared out the blue room?
- Everything.

64
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,950
Madam, we' re all deeply sorry.

65
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:30,669
Marie.

66
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,590
Why are you crying?

67
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,950
Because you're not.

68
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,190
I keep thinking of them.

69
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:00,110
I remember everything.

70
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,909
How can I forget?

71
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:04,870
Would you like something to drink?

72
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,429
No thank you.

73
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,299
Let's sit down.
This could take a while.

74
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,419
I'll be right back.

75
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,789
No one must know.

76
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,049
Even

77
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:12,500
You'll pay for my mother's
rest home for the rest of her life.

78
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,700
You'll take care of Marie...

79
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:18,259
and the gardener.

80
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,700
You'll sell all our possessions.

81
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,579
The money will go
to the same account.

82
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,500
The 270641196?

83
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,460
Yes.

84
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:33,940
May I ask you why?

85
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,269
No.

86
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,220
Would you excuse me?

87
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:51,819
But what will you have left?

88
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,170
My own account.

89
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:10,140
I haven't started yet.

90
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,099
I put it aside...

91
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:15,619
The day I left?

92
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:16,819
Yes.

93
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:21,180
Here it is.

94
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:24,380
I was waiting to hear from you.

95
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,339
You were right.

96
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:37,650
Lots of corrections.

97
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,500
No more than usual.

98
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,089
It's beautiful.

99
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,710
I love this chorus.

100
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,460
Yes.

101
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:01,630
Hello?

102
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:03,019
It's Julie.

103
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:05,059
Do you love me?

104
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,099
Yes.

105
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:08,529
Since when?

106
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,980
Since I started working
with Patrice.

107
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,859
Do you think of me?
Do you miss me?

108
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,500
Yes.

109
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,019
Come, if you want to.

110
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:20,740
Now?

111
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,660
Yes, now. Right away.

112
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,769
Are you sure?

113
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:26,579
Yes.

114
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:07,619
Olivier?

115
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,660
I fell.

116
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:22,900
Take it off.

117
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,059
The rest too.

118
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,420
They took everything.

119
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,059
Only the mattress is left.

120
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:26,299
I appreciate what you did for me.

121
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,819
But you see,
I'm like any other woman.

122
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:33,059
I sweat. I cough.

123
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,700
I have cavities.

124
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:38,740
You won't miss me.

125
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:41,099
You understand that now.

126
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:49,500
Shut the door when you leave.

127
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,500
Julie!

128
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:25,490
I don't want any children
in the building.

129
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,589
Let me ask you something.
It may help.

130
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:30,170
What do you do?

131
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,220
Nothing.

132
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,700
I mean, for a living?

133
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:34,819
Nothing.

134
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,420
Nothing at all?

135
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,849
Nothing at all.

136
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,940
I have what you're looking for.

137
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:45,420
You'll like it,
but it's being redone.

138
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,259
It may take a while.

139
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,180
But I can live there now?

140
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,849
Sure. It needs a quick paint job,
the carpets changed...

141
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:56,660
I'd like to see it now.
May I?

142
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:59,059
Of course. What's your name?

143
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,980
Julie de Courcy, with a|

144
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,500
Sorry, Julie Vignon.
I'm going back

145
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,930
to my maiden name.

146
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,069
Coffee and ice cream?

147
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,470
As usual.

148
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,539
Is anyone there?

149
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,230
Is anyone there?

150
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,369
I'm sorry for the noise.
I've almost finished.

151
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,019
I haven't heard anything.

152
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,860
May I?

153
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,659
I heard you got locked out
last week.

154
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:17,500
Your husband lent me a blanket.

155
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,699
I spent the night in the stairwell.

156
00:38:19,909 --> 00:38:22,059
I wanted you to sign this.

157
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:24,050
What is it?

158
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:25,539
Everyone has signed already.

159
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:30,340
We don't want loose women
in our building.

160
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,179
The young woman downstairs...

161
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,619
I don't want to get involved.

162
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,139
She's a whore!

163
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,260
That's not my problem.

164
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,070
You're in perfect health.
Everything is fine.

165
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,230
You're in good spirits.

166
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:11,150
Hello, it's Antoine.

167
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,219
It's for you.

168
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,309
Hello. My name is Antoine.
You don't know me.

169
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,579
No, I don't. Excuse me...

170
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:23,110
Who is this?

171
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,429
He's been looking for you.
I said he could call.

172
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:28,829
That's okay.

173
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,110
I'd like to meet you.
It's important.

174
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,750
Nothing's important.

175
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,019
It's about an object.

176
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:38,269
What object?

177
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,780
A necklace...

178
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,869
with a cross.

179
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:07,659
I'd forgotten about it.

180
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:11,230
I found it near the car.

181
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,789
But...

182
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,949
I couldn't keep it.
That's stealing.

183
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,150
If you want to ask me something,
I got there just after...

184
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:25,980
No.

185
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,750
I'm sorry.

186
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,230
I wanted to return the necklace,

187
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,300
but I wanted
to ask you something, too.

188
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,429
Yes?

189
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,269
When I opened the door,

190
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:00,989
your husband was still alive.

191
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:03,750
He said...

192
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,590
...I don't understand...

193
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,429
he said...

194
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,710
"Now try coughing."

195
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:34,670
My husband was telling us a joke.

196
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,349
It's about a woman who...

197
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,360
who can't stop coughing.
She sees a doctor.

198
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,429
He examines her and gives her
a pill. She swallows it.

199
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,869
She asks what it is.

200
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:53,269
The doctor says: "It's the most
powerful laxative there is."

201
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,030
"A laxative for a cough?"

202
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,710
"Yes," says the doctor.
"Now try coughing!"

203
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:03,710
It made us laugh.

204
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:08,670
Then the car crashed.

205
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,429
My husband always liked

206
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:17,909
to repeat the punch line.

207
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,949
You returned it.

208
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:25,230
It's yours.

209
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:42,789
Are you sick?

210
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,940
Are you okay?

211
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,030
You always gotta hold
onto something.

212
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:05,710
What did you say?

213
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,909
Thanks.

214
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:38,190
For what?

215
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,349
I'm staying.

216
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,829
They needed everyone's signature
to kick me out. So I'm staying.

217
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,789
Your place is cool.

218
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,150
When I was a kid,
I had a lamp just like this.

219
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:08,579
I'd stand under it
and stretch out my hand.

220
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,269
I dreamt of jumping up
and touching it.

221
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,789
I forgot all about it.

222
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:28,550
Where did you find it?

223
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,539
I found it.

224
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,019
Is it a souvenir?

225
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,190
You live alone?

226
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,070
Yes.

227
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,349
I could never spend
a night alone.

228
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,030
Something must have happened.

229
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:53,909
You're not the type
somebody dumps.

230
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,510
Sorry. I talk too much.

231
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,579
Poor guy.

232
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,260
Who?

233
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,150
He was asleep there last night.

234
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:32,469
He's gone now,
but he left his flute.

235
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:52,989
A coffee.

236
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:03,030
I searched everywhere.

237
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:05,230
And?

238
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,630
I found you.

239
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:10,699
No one knows where I live.

240
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:11,739
No one.

241
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:15,699
It took a few months.
Then I got lucky.

242
00:48:15,909 --> 00:48:18,579
My cleaning lady's daughter
saw you in the area.

243
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:22,269
I've come here ever since.

244
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,099
You're spying on me?

245
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:24,940
No.

246
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:27,369
I miss you.

247
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:38,179
You ran away?

248
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:43,659
From me?

249
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:33,300
Do you hear what he's playing?

250
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,090
It sounds like...

251
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:42,179
Yes.

252
00:49:48,909 --> 00:49:50,019
I've seen you.

253
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,780
Maybe that will do for now.

254
00:49:56,269 --> 00:49:57,329
I'll try.

255
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:25,019
How do you know this music?

256
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:28,659
I invent lots of things.
I like to play.

257
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:03,630
Just a second.
A problem with your place?

258
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,659
No, I'd like another one
just like it.

259
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,309
I can manage that.
But it'll take some time.

260
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:12,179
How long?

261
00:52:12,949 --> 00:52:14,010
Two or three months.

262
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:18,340
You cut yourself shaving.

263
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:19,500
 

264
00:52:23,269 --> 00:52:24,539
My cat scratched me.

265
00:53:42,909 --> 00:53:43,460
Mom?

266
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:47,940
Marie-France.

267
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:53,659
It's me.

268
00:53:55,349 --> 00:53:56,409
Julie.

269
00:53:59,389 --> 00:54:00,820
Come closer.

270
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,110
They told me you were dead.

271
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:15,619
You seem fine.

272
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:20,019
Young. So young.

273
00:54:21,909 --> 00:54:25,380
You were always younger,
but now you look 30.

274
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,670
- When we were kids...
- I'm not your sister.

275
00:54:27,869 --> 00:54:30,860
I'm your daughter.
I'm 33.

276
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:32,460
I know, I know.

277
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:34,820
I'm joking.

278
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:36,579
I'm fine.

279
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:39,219
I have everything here.
The TV...

280
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,420
I can see the whole world.

281
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,420
Do you watch too?

282
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:48,460
No.

283
00:55:00,389 --> 00:55:03,619
You want to tell me
about your husband and your home?

284
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:05,940
Or about your children?

285
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:10,380
Or about yourself?

286
00:55:11,590 --> 00:55:12,539
Mom...

287
00:55:16,789 --> 00:55:18,860
my husband and daughter
are dead.

288
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:21,179
I have no home any more.

289
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:24,019
They told me.

290
00:55:33,389 --> 00:55:35,900
Before, I was happy.

291
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,699
I loved them.
They loved me too.

292
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:45,500
Mom, are you listening?

293
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,170
Yes, Marie-France.

294
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,820
Now I have only
one thing left to do:

295
00:55:58,590 --> 00:55:59,619
Nothing.

296
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:05,050
I don't want any belongings,
any memories.

297
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:08,579
No friends, no love.
Those are all traps.

298
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:13,340
Do you have any money, my child?
To get by?

299
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:14,659
I have enough.

300
00:56:14,869 --> 00:56:18,019
That's important.
You can't give up everything.

301
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:24,460
Mom.

302
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:26,099
Yes?

303
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:29,340
Was I scared of mice

304
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:30,500
as a kid?

305
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:33,179
You weren't scared.

306
00:56:34,989 --> 00:56:37,059
It was Julie who was scared.

307
00:56:37,989 --> 00:56:39,500
Now I'm scared.

308
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:27,099
I'm glad to see you.
Come in.

309
00:58:27,309 --> 00:58:29,300
I have a favor to ask.

310
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,500
My wife isn't here.
Come on in.

311
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:34,789
Can you lend me your cat?

312
00:58:35,949 --> 00:58:37,139
Excuse me?

313
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:41,050
Your cat.
I need it for a couple of days.

314
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:44,539
He's not neutered.
He can get violent.

315
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:57,340
I'm not sure he likes you.

316
00:59:39,269 --> 00:59:40,739
Why are you here?

317
00:59:40,949 --> 00:59:43,820
I saw you from the bus.
You were running like crazy.

318
00:59:45,469 --> 00:59:46,380
Are you crying?

319
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:59,019
It's the water.

320
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:02,780
- You don't wear underwear?
- Never.

321
01:00:10,429 --> 01:00:13,340
I borrowed the neighbor's cat
to kill the mouse.

322
01:00:14,469 --> 01:00:16,219
It had babies.

323
01:00:17,389 --> 01:00:20,420
It's only normal, Julie.
You're afraid to go back?

324
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:25,940
I'll go clean up.

325
01:00:36,469 --> 01:00:37,940
I'll see you at my place.

326
01:01:04,429 --> 01:01:07,420
It's Lucille.
I need a favor.

327
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:09,739
Take a taxi here.
I'll pay you back.

328
01:01:10,389 --> 01:01:11,369
Now?

329
01:01:12,389 --> 01:01:13,219
It's late.

330
01:01:13,429 --> 01:01:16,739
It's 11:30. You have 25 minutes.
It's important.

331
01:01:16,949 --> 01:01:17,860
I can't.

332
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:21,849
Please. I've never asked you
anything. I have to now. Come.

333
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:23,420
Where?

334
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:27,539
3 Cite du Midi. It's near Pigalle.
First door on the left.

335
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:31,289
There's a buzzer
Say it's for me. You'll come?

336
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:48,579
Yes?

337
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:50,010
I'm here to see Lucille.

338
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:51,059
I'm coming.

339
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:31,849
You came.

340
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:39,170
I'm sorry.

341
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:42,539
Sorry.

342
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,349
Are you angry?

343
01:02:53,989 --> 01:02:54,739
No.

344
01:02:57,869 --> 01:03:01,059
Lucille, we're on in 5 minutes.
Get me ready.

345
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:08,059
After I changed,
I came here for a drink.

346
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:11,500
I looked around the audience,
for no reason.

347
01:03:13,469 --> 01:03:14,610
In the middle,

348
01:03:15,789 --> 01:03:18,460
in the first row, I saw my father.

349
01:03:22,269 --> 01:03:24,829
He seemed tired.

350
01:03:25,949 --> 01:03:27,619
He was nodding off...

351
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:31,500
but kept staring
at the girl's ass.

352
01:03:31,719 --> 01:03:36,110
The shithead who let you in
wouldn't make him leave.

353
01:03:37,469 --> 01:03:40,900
If you pay, you can peep.
Get it?

354
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:45,139
I didn't know who I could count on.

355
01:03:45,349 --> 01:03:49,130
I was desperate.
I didn't know who to talk to.

356
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:53,179
- So I called you.
- And your father?

357
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:55,940
Ten minutes ago,

358
01:03:57,670 --> 01:03:59,940
he looked at his watch and left.

359
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:06,460
I realized the last train
to Montpellier is at 11:45.

360
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:08,619
Lucille, why do you do this?

361
01:04:10,989 --> 01:04:12,300
Because I like to.

362
01:04:14,869 --> 01:04:16,980
I think everyone likes to.

363
01:04:21,389 --> 01:04:22,780
Julie, you saved my life.

364
01:04:22,989 --> 01:04:23,940
I didn't do a thing.

365
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:26,710
I asked you to come and you came.
Same thing.

366
01:04:26,909 --> 01:04:27,579
No.

367
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:36,769
Isn't that you?

368
01:04:40,269 --> 01:04:41,820
Lucille, we're on.

369
01:04:43,909 --> 01:04:44,739
It's me.

370
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,190
...the European Council asked you

371
01:04:51,389 --> 01:04:54,500
to finish the score
begun by Patrice de Courcy.

372
01:04:54,869 --> 01:04:58,460
I agreed to.
I'm working on it now...

373
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:01,019
trying to understand
what he was aiming for.

374
01:05:01,239 --> 01:05:03,429
It's not easy... I don 't know.

375
01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:04,900
Can you tell us something

376
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:09,139
about this score, shown here
for the very first time?

377
01:05:11,309 --> 01:05:12,699
It's the first part

378
01:05:13,269 --> 01:05:15,570
of a major concerto
Patrice composed,

379
01:05:15,789 --> 01:05:17,659
commissioned
by the European Council.

380
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:22,500
The concerto was
to be played just once

381
01:05:23,309 --> 01:05:25,219
by twelve symphonic orchestras

382
01:05:25,429 --> 01:05:28,340
in the twelve united
European cities.

383
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:32,980
Patrice was someone who...
was secretive.

384
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:36,699
The only one person
who understood him...

385
01:05:36,909 --> 01:05:38,300
was Julie, his wife.

386
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:41,269
I tried asking her to participate

387
01:05:41,469 --> 01:05:43,579
in this program,
but unfortunately,

388
01:05:43,789 --> 01:05:45,139
she refused.

389
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:50,539
I assume that these documents
are from the archives.

390
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:53,539
No, they're not archives.
Who can predict...?

391
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:55,829
They're photos and documents

392
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:59,260
I found in Patrice's desk
at the Conservatory.

393
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:01,179
His wife didn't want them.

394
01:06:02,789 --> 01:06:04,260
I'm not sure
I should show them.

395
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,230
He was a great man.

396
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:09,380
One of the most important
composers of our time.

397
01:06:50,909 --> 01:06:52,050
I'll be five minutes.

398
01:06:58,190 --> 01:06:59,780
Where did I put it?

399
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:02,139
A green calling card.

400
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:05,260
Did you watch TV today?

401
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:08,139
Not at all.

402
01:07:09,429 --> 01:07:10,489
Here it is.

403
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:13,460
Her number at home and at work.

404
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:16,539
Why do you want it?

405
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:22,260
Today, on TV,
she showed the scores

406
01:07:22,469 --> 01:07:23,860
I took from you.

407
01:07:25,269 --> 01:07:26,139
Yes...

408
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:32,699
After the accident, when
nothing was sure, I made a copy.

409
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:36,579
When you picked it up,
I knew you'd destroy it.

410
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:40,150
I kept the copy.
I sent it to Strasbourg.

411
01:07:40,349 --> 01:07:42,019
Why did you do that?

412
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:48,059
This music is so beautiful.
You can't destroy things like that.

413
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:10,179
Olivier!

414
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:31,420
I'm sorry.

415
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:33,489
It's nothing.

416
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:37,819
I heard you're finishing
Patrice's concerto.

417
01:08:38,029 --> 01:08:39,460
I thought I could try...

418
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:42,100
You can't.
You have no right.

419
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:43,770
It'll never be the same.

420
01:08:43,989 --> 01:08:44,659
Understand?

421
01:08:44,869 --> 01:08:47,380
I said I'd try.
I don't know if I'll finish.

422
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:51,699
I'll tell you why. It was a way...
that's what I thought...

423
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:55,020
to make you cry, make you run.

424
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:00,109
The only way of making you say,
"I want" or "I don't want".

425
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:03,739
It's not fair.

426
01:09:04,189 --> 01:09:06,220
You didn't leave me any choice.

427
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:13,819
You don't have the right to.

428
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:16,300
You want to see what I've done?

429
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:20,340
I'm not sure I understood.

430
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:23,550
If I could play for you...

431
01:09:54,909 --> 01:09:57,859
Do you know what the chorus sings?

432
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,430
I thought Patrice had told you.

433
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,310
No.

434
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:04,020
In Greek, the rhythm is different.

435
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,069
Who was that girl?

436
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:28,250
What girl?

437
01:10:31,109 --> 01:10:34,890
In the photos on the program.
She was with Patrice.

438
01:10:35,989 --> 01:10:37,130
Didn't you know?

439
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:40,789
Just tell me.

440
01:10:40,989 --> 01:10:42,050
Were they together?

441
01:10:42,949 --> 01:10:43,699
Yes.

442
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:48,060
Since when?

443
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:50,859
Several years.

444
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,140
Where does she live?

445
01:10:58,510 --> 01:11:00,020
Near Montparnasse.

446
01:11:00,829 --> 01:11:03,859
They often met at the courts.
She's a lawyer.

447
01:11:04,359 --> 01:11:06,989
Or she works for one.

448
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:10,539
What do you want to do?

449
01:11:26,789 --> 01:11:28,140
Meet her.

450
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:00,100
Excuse me.

451
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:39,699
...what about equality?

452
01:12:43,909 --> 01:12:46,939
Is it because I don't speak French

453
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:49,720
that the court won't hear my case?

454
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:47,579
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

455
01:13:55,159 --> 01:13:55,909
Yes?

456
01:13:57,189 --> 01:13:58,619
You were
my husband's mistress?

457
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:01,340
Yes.

458
01:14:04,789 --> 01:14:07,300
I didn't know. I just found out.

459
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:12,090
It's a shame.

460
01:14:12,869 --> 01:14:15,779
Now you'll hate him.
You'll hate me too.

461
01:14:16,189 --> 01:14:16,859
I don't know...

462
01:14:19,949 --> 01:14:20,979
Of course you will.

463
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:30,489
Is that his baby?

464
01:14:34,229 --> 01:14:35,020
Yes.

465
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:38,699
But he didn't know.
I found out...

466
01:14:39,869 --> 01:14:41,899
I found out after the accident.

467
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:49,699
I didn't want a child, but
it happened. Now I want to keep it.

468
01:14:58,189 --> 01:14:59,460
Do you have a cigarette?

469
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,149
You shouldn't.

470
01:15:22,029 --> 01:15:23,939
You want to know
when and where?

471
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:26,140
How many times a month?

472
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:27,340
No.

473
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:32,340
You want to know if he loved me?

474
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:34,659
Yes, that was my question.

475
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:37,829
But why ask?

476
01:15:38,029 --> 01:15:39,380
I know he loved you.

477
01:15:42,229 --> 01:15:43,020
Yes.

478
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:45,649
He loved me.

479
01:15:47,989 --> 01:15:48,739
Julie...

480
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:52,430
Will you hate me now?

481
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:31,979
Come in.

482
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:34,789
Did something happen?

483
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:38,659
You met her?

484
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:56,060
Once you asked me
to take Patrice's papers.

485
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:59,140
- You didn't want to.
- No, but if I had...

486
01:18:01,789 --> 01:18:03,899
The photos were among them?

487
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:05,420
Yes.

488
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:09,090
If I had taken them,
I'd have known.

489
01:18:10,789 --> 01:18:12,460
If I'd burned them,

490
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:14,069
I'd never have known.

491
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:15,340
That's right.

492
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:20,340
Maybe it's better this way.

493
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:23,970
Can you show me
what you've composed?

494
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:26,729
These are the violins?

495
01:18:26,949 --> 01:18:27,979
The altos.

496
01:18:36,869 --> 01:18:37,819
And now...

497
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:52,659
Wait a second. Lighter,
without the percussions.

498
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:00,779
Let's remove the trumpets.

499
01:19:09,029 --> 01:19:11,539
Piano, piano, sul, sul taste.

500
01:19:16,430 --> 01:19:17,899
Instead of a piano...

501
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:19,529
A flute?

502
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,380
A flute. Start back here.

503
01:19:48,869 --> 01:19:50,220
That's as far as I got.

504
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:52,539
And the finale?

505
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:54,460
I don't know.

506
01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:57,979
There was a paper.

507
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:04,220
The counterpoint
was supposed to come back.

508
01:20:11,229 --> 01:20:13,340
He told me: "It's a memento."

509
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,420
Try weaving it back in.

510
01:20:18,189 --> 01:20:19,659
Van den Budenmayer?

511
01:20:20,829 --> 01:20:24,819
He wanted to allude to him at the
end. You know how much he loved him.

512
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:30,260
Are you still in touch
with our lawyer?

513
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:31,529
Sometimes.

514
01:20:32,189 --> 01:20:33,859
Did he sell the house yet?

515
01:20:34,069 --> 01:20:34,859
I don't know.

516
01:20:35,359 --> 01:20:36,989
I doubt it. He'd have called.

517
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:39,189
Tell him not to.

518
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:40,260
Okay.

519
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:43,020
If you can handle all this,

520
01:20:43,789 --> 01:20:45,010
will you show me?

521
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:46,659
I'll show you.

522
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,069
There was a mattress inside.

523
01:20:54,710 --> 01:20:56,340
Mr. Olivier bought it.

524
01:20:57,189 --> 01:20:58,539
I didn't think you'd need it.

525
01:20:58,750 --> 01:20:59,579
That's fine.

526
01:21:11,029 --> 01:21:12,779
Have you been here before?

527
01:21:14,189 --> 01:21:15,539
No, never.

528
01:21:18,909 --> 01:21:23,140
Upstairs are the bedrooms and the
office. I'll show you them later.

529
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:27,260
This is the kitchen.
It's always been like this.

530
01:21:33,149 --> 01:21:34,130
Is it a boy

531
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:35,140
or a girl?

532
01:21:35,789 --> 01:21:36,819
A boy.

533
01:21:38,109 --> 01:21:39,979
Have you chosen a name?

534
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:42,189
Yes.

535
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:46,819
I thought...

536
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:50,220
he should have his name
and his house.

537
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:51,539
Here.

538
01:21:53,359 --> 01:21:54,550
Do you still need me?

539
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:56,859
No, you can go home.
Thank you.

540
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:02,609
I knew it.

541
01:22:02,829 --> 01:22:03,659
What?

542
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,539
Patrice told me a lot about you.

543
01:22:07,399 --> 01:22:08,270
Really?

544
01:22:08,989 --> 01:22:10,020
Like what?

545
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:12,100
That you are good.

546
01:22:13,630 --> 01:22:15,460
That you are good and generous.

547
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:18,420
That's what you want to be.

548
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,989
People can always count on you.

549
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,229
Even me.

550
01:22:31,630 --> 01:22:32,579
I'm sorry.

551
01:23:22,710 --> 01:23:24,060
It's me. I've finished.

552
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:27,859
Come pick it up tomorrow.
Or now, if you're not too tired.

553
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:31,699
I'm not tired. But I won't come
pick up the score.

554
01:23:32,789 --> 01:23:33,500
What?

555
01:23:34,949 --> 01:23:36,140
I won't pick it up.

556
01:23:37,359 --> 01:23:41,710
I've been thinking about it all
week long. This music can be mine.

557
01:23:41,909 --> 01:23:43,420
A little heavy and awkward,

558
01:23:43,989 --> 01:23:48,140
but mine. Or yours,
but everyone would have to know.

559
01:23:50,789 --> 01:23:51,899
Are you there?

560
01:23:53,229 --> 01:23:54,369
I'm here.

561
01:23:57,470 --> 01:23:58,659
You're right.

562
01:24:31,710 --> 01:24:35,380
It's me again.
I wanted to ask you.

563
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:37,739
You really sleep
on the mattress...?

564
01:24:37,949 --> 01:24:38,500
Yes.

565
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:43,470
You never told me.

566
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:45,939
No, I didn't.

567
01:24:54,029 --> 01:24:55,819
Do you still love me?

568
01:24:59,229 --> 01:25:00,340
I love you.

569
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:05,770
Are you alone?

570
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:07,779
Of course I'm alone.

571
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:17,579
I'm coming.

572
01:25:46,789 --> 01:25:51,420
Though I speak
with the tongue of angels,

573
01:25:51,869 --> 01:25:56,420
If I have not love,

574
01:25:58,069 --> 01:26:02,619
I am become as hollow brass.

575
01:26:46,109 --> 01:26:48,619
Though I have the gift of prophecy,

576
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:51,100
And understand all mysteries

577
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:55,659
And all knowledge...

578
01:26:56,270 --> 01:27:00,380
And though l have enough faith

579
01:27:00,829 --> 01:27:04,979
To move the mightiest mountains,

580
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:09,100
If I have not love,

581
01:27:12,909 --> 01:27:16,300
I am nothing.

582
01:27:18,029 --> 01:27:20,590
Love is patient.

583
01:27:22,869 --> 01:27:25,170
Love is kind.

584
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:28,930
It bears all things.

585
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:31,939
It hopes all things.

586
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:58,489
Love never fails.

587
01:27:58,710 --> 01:28:02,699
For prophecies shall fail,

588
01:28:02,909 --> 01:28:06,609
Tongues shall cease,

589
01:28:06,829 --> 01:28:10,500
Knowledge shall wither away.

590
01:28:34,069 --> 01:28:38,140
For prophecies shall fail,

591
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,159
Tongues shall cease,

592
01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:47,100
Knowledge shall wither away.

593
01:29:07,470 --> 01:29:10,140
And now shall abide...

594
01:29:11,949 --> 01:29:15,489
Faith, hope, and love.

595
01:29:39,189 --> 01:29:41,819
But the greatest of these three

596
01:29:42,029 --> 01:29:44,779
Is love.
