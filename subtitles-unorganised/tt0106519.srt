1
00:03:40,194 --> 00:03:42,913
Somebody's pullin' me close to the ground.

2
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:46,470
I can sense, but I can't see.

3
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:50,627
I ain't panicked. I been here before.

4
00:03:50,994 --> 00:03:53,667
Same as when I got popped
on 104th Street.

5
00:03:54,954 --> 00:03:57,422
Don't take me to no hospital, please.

6
00:03:57,554 --> 00:04:00,193
Fuckin' emergency rooms
don't save nobody.

7
00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:02,823
Son of a bitches always pop you
at midnight...

8
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:06,384
...when all they got is a Chinese intern
with a dull spoon.

9
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:12,065
Look at these suckers scramblin' around.
What for?

10
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:16,150
My Puerto Rican ass ain't supposed
to have made it this far.

11
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:19,786
Most of my crew got washed
a long time ago.

12
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:28,832
Don't worry. My heart, it don't ever quit.

13
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:32,065
I ain't ready to check out.

14
00:04:41,794 --> 00:04:44,308
Seems like I just got out of thejoint.

15
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:48,513
Stood up in front of that judge,
and told him what was who.

16
00:04:51,354 --> 00:04:54,551
Now I ain't sayin' that my way
would have been different...

17
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:58,872
...had my mother been alive when I was
a kid, 'cause that's all you hear in the joint.

18
00:04:58,954 --> 00:05:02,708
"I didn't have a chance." No. Bullshit.

19
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:07,903
I was already a mean little bastard
while my mother was alive, and I know it.

20
00:05:07,994 --> 00:05:09,746
But I learned about women from her.

21
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:13,509
Mr. Brigante, there are 56 cases
on the court's docket for this morning.

22
00:05:13,594 --> 00:05:15,027
Why am I listening to this?

23
00:05:15,154 --> 00:05:17,714
Your Honor, Mr. Brigante
is understandably excited...

24
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:20,672
...having been vindicated
after five years of incarceration.

25
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,551
There's no vindication here, counselor.

26
00:05:22,674 --> 00:05:25,234
Or absolution, or benediction,
or anything...

27
00:05:25,474 --> 00:05:27,988
...other than an incredible
convergence of circumstances...

28
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:30,429
...which you've exploited
to your client's benefit.

29
00:05:30,514 --> 00:05:32,903
Your Honor, these circumstances
that you speak of...

30
00:05:32,994 --> 00:05:35,713
...include illegal wiretaps
and tainted evidence.

31
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,752
This is a classic
"fruit of the poisoned tree" situation.

32
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:41,348
I think after five years
of unjust incarceration...

33
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:45,222
...it's reasonable to request Mr. Brigante
be indulged his right to speak.

34
00:05:45,394 --> 00:05:47,464
Okay, Mr. Brigante, I'm all ears.

35
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:49,793
Your Honor...

36
00:05:50,354 --> 00:05:52,026
...with all due respect...

37
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:55,706
...past and present,
and without further to-do.

38
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:01,790
Let me assure this court that
I am through walkin' on the wild side.

39
00:06:02,794 --> 00:06:04,705
That's all I've been tryin' to tell you.

40
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:09,191
I have been sick with the social ills
known in the ghetto...

41
00:06:09,714 --> 00:06:14,230
...but my time in the sterling
correctional facilities...

42
00:06:14,714 --> 00:06:18,912
...of Green Haven and Sing Sing
has not been in vain. I've been cured!

43
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:22,149
Born again, like the Watergaters.

44
00:06:22,394 --> 00:06:25,704
I know you heard this rap before.
Your Honor, I mean it.

45
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:28,110
This is the truth. I changed.

46
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:31,746
I changed and it didn't take no 30 years...

47
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:34,985
...like Your Honor thought, but only five.

48
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:38,148
That's right, sir. Five years.

49
00:06:38,554 --> 00:06:41,591
And look at me. Completely rehabilitated...

50
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:47,352
...reinvigorated, reassimilated,
and finally gonna be relocated.

51
00:06:47,594 --> 00:06:49,789
And I want to thank
a lot of people for that.

52
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:52,513
I look over there and I see
that man there, Mr. Norwalk.

53
00:06:52,794 --> 00:06:56,548
I want to thank you, sir,
for making the tapes in an illegal fashion.

54
00:06:57,354 --> 00:07:02,633
I would like to thank the Court of Appeals
for reversing you, Your Honor.

55
00:07:03,114 --> 00:07:04,786
And I want to thank...

56
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:08,992
...AImighty God, without whom
no case gets tossed.

57
00:07:09,354 --> 00:07:12,903
- I can't believe this.
- I must have forgot. How could I forget...

58
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:16,392
...my dear, close friend and lawyer...

59
00:07:17,114 --> 00:07:21,744
...David Kleinfeld,
who never gave up on me...

60
00:07:22,154 --> 00:07:23,906
...through everything, thick and thin.

61
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:26,747
- Why don't you just stand up?
- I'm sorry.

62
00:07:27,074 --> 00:07:29,542
- Mr. Brigante!
- Davey Kleinfeld.

63
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:32,029
You're not accepting an award.

64
00:07:33,594 --> 00:07:35,152
Court of Appeals' decision...

65
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:40,467
...and the District Attorney's
unfortunate investigative techniques...

66
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,309
...now devolve upon me the painful duty
of unleashing upon society...

67
00:07:45,394 --> 00:07:48,625
...a reputed assassin
and convicted purveyor of narcotics.

68
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,746
No. Never convicted on no dope.

69
00:07:52,794 --> 00:07:56,469
The indictment is dismissed.
Prisoner is discharged. Call the next case.

70
00:07:57,114 --> 00:07:59,230
- I'm indebted to you.
- Okay.

71
00:07:59,794 --> 00:08:01,022
I feel like I won.

72
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,070
Excuse me. Congratulations.

73
00:08:05,994 --> 00:08:09,145
- No hard feelings, right?
- I'll be seeing you, Brigante.

74
00:08:13,434 --> 00:08:15,664
That was some line of crap
you handed him in there.

75
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:19,264
That was no line of crap, man.
I meant every word I said.

76
00:08:20,154 --> 00:08:22,543
You don't understand. You don't get it.

77
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:25,434
I'm a free man,
and I don't mean just out of jail.

78
00:08:25,514 --> 00:08:29,268
"I am free at last, free at last...

79
00:08:29,794 --> 00:08:34,914
- "...thank God Almighty, I am free at last!"
- I gotta work here. Save your energy.

80
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:37,383
Wait till you see what I got
lined up for tonight.

81
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:51,390
So what are you gonna do for money?
Hook up with Rolando again?

82
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:54,392
I told you, I ain't goin' back to the street.

83
00:08:56,114 --> 00:08:58,344
Twenty-five years I worked that sucker.

84
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,870
What do I got to show for it? Squat.

85
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:03,422
You dancing with me
or you dancing with him?

86
00:09:03,714 --> 00:09:06,353
What does that mean,
"I ain't goin' back on the street"?

87
00:09:06,434 --> 00:09:08,584
What else do you know how to do?

88
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:11,868
- I got plans, baby.
- Talk to me.

89
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:16,351
'Cause you can dance
with him if you wanna.

90
00:09:17,194 --> 00:09:20,152
I know Dave since he was
just out of law school.

91
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:23,746
He was workin' as a clerk
for a big mob lawyer.

92
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:28,393
Kept a tire iron under the seat of his car,
tried like hell not to look scared...

93
00:09:28,474 --> 00:09:30,465
...by all his wise guy clients.

94
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:34,226
But Davey Kleinfeld,
he ain't scared no more.

95
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:38,913
So look at you.

96
00:09:40,154 --> 00:09:42,190
You really made something of your life.

97
00:09:42,354 --> 00:09:45,471
You put me in business.
All my first clients came through you.

98
00:09:45,674 --> 00:09:47,824
As I say, you know, top drawer.

99
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:50,025
You're top drawer, Davey.

100
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:51,902
Man.

101
00:09:52,674 --> 00:09:56,349
Listen, I got something for you.
You remember Saso?

102
00:09:56,834 --> 00:09:58,187
Saso. Yeah.

103
00:09:58,274 --> 00:10:00,390
Fat guy, had the Argentine place
on Madison.

104
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:03,467
He bought the lease on this bankrupt disco.
Beautiful place.

105
00:10:03,554 --> 00:10:05,704
I got some investors together
and we backed him.

106
00:10:05,794 --> 00:10:07,591
I got $50,000 in the place.

107
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:11,064
Problem is Saso. He's been shakin' the till,
payin' off gambling debts.

108
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:14,146
He says he doesn't get $25,000,
he's gonna lose his lease.

109
00:10:14,274 --> 00:10:16,629
I like the place. I go there sometimes.

110
00:10:16,714 --> 00:10:19,274
The money's no big deal.
I don't mind puttin' it in...

111
00:10:19,354 --> 00:10:23,313
...as long as I know there's someone there
who's gonna run the place straight, clean.

112
00:10:23,634 --> 00:10:24,623
Me?

113
00:10:25,554 --> 00:10:27,863
I owned clubs. I never ran 'em.

114
00:10:28,434 --> 00:10:30,994
What's the big deal?
You step in, straighten things out...

115
00:10:31,074 --> 00:10:33,827
...you take a salary, a chunk of the profits.
- Please.

116
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,903
You've done enough already for me.

117
00:10:38,114 --> 00:10:40,264
You call it a favor between friends.

118
00:10:40,394 --> 00:10:42,112
No favor. I owe you.

119
00:10:42,714 --> 00:10:45,023
Favor gonna kill you faster than a bullet.

120
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:56,466
You saved my life.

121
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:00,306
You saved my life, Dave.

122
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,110
Thirty years. You know what that is?

123
00:11:03,874 --> 00:11:07,753
I was dead. I was buried.
I was under the ground.

124
00:11:09,234 --> 00:11:10,428
You dug me up.

125
00:11:14,994 --> 00:11:17,189
I don't know what to say to you.

126
00:11:18,434 --> 00:11:20,152
I just don't know what to say.

127
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:21,633
Say you love me.

128
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,463
I love you.

129
00:11:24,514 --> 00:11:27,347
If you was a broad, I'd marry you.

130
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:30,265
- My boy.
- I bet you would.

131
00:11:30,514 --> 00:11:32,823
Who's that? Well, you know...

132
00:11:33,434 --> 00:11:36,585
Look, we're going to the ladies' room.

133
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:38,429
Goodbye, you two.

134
00:11:38,514 --> 00:11:40,744
- Well, somebody's got to.
- Bye-bye.

135
00:11:49,354 --> 00:11:51,310
So, what are these plans?

136
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:54,429
What's the big goddamn secret?

137
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:03,188
You remember a guy named Clyde Bassie?

138
00:12:03,554 --> 00:12:05,670
Got out of the joint a couple of years ago.

139
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:10,023
He went down to the Bahamas,
Paradise Island...

140
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:13,783
...and he got this car rental place.

141
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:16,423
He used to talk about it
all the time in the can.

142
00:12:16,554 --> 00:12:19,352
He got out, he went down there,
put it together.

143
00:12:19,514 --> 00:12:22,426
And it's doin' good. Real good.

144
00:12:23,074 --> 00:12:25,269
I mean, like, it's makin' money.

145
00:12:26,314 --> 00:12:29,863
Couple of months ago
he wrote me and he said...

146
00:12:30,394 --> 00:12:33,830
...I could buy in any time
I got $75,000 together.

147
00:12:39,754 --> 00:12:41,472
You're gonna rent cars.

148
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,426
What are you laughing at?

149
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:58,071
- You're gonna rent cars.
- That's right. I know a lot about cars.

150
00:12:58,354 --> 00:13:00,709
I've been stealing 'em since I was 14.

151
00:13:01,474 --> 00:13:02,987
Look at him laugh.

152
00:13:09,234 --> 00:13:10,826
I'll tell you something.

153
00:13:11,634 --> 00:13:14,432
Car rental guys don't get killed that much.

154
00:13:17,074 --> 00:13:19,508
And where are you gonna get the $75,000?

155
00:13:20,354 --> 00:13:23,664
I don't know. Maybe some rich relative
dies and leaves it to me.

156
00:13:25,394 --> 00:13:28,352
It's a dream, Dave. You gotta dream, baby.

157
00:13:29,634 --> 00:13:32,228
You got it all worked out, Carlito.
Here's to you.

158
00:13:35,074 --> 00:13:36,951
So here's me back on the street.

159
00:13:37,714 --> 00:13:40,433
Third Sunday in August.
Old Timer's Day in the barrio.

160
00:13:40,514 --> 00:13:43,153
- When did you get out, papi?
- A couple of days ago.

161
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:44,742
Nothin' left.

162
00:13:44,914 --> 00:13:48,873
Like them old cowboy movies,
but instead of tumbleweed and cow dung...

163
00:13:49,274 --> 00:13:51,913
...we got stripped car wrecks and dog shit.

164
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:54,066
A lot of new faces?

165
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:57,353
These young guys, I don't recognize 'em.

166
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:01,745
Mi barrio ya no existe.

167
00:14:02,794 --> 00:14:05,433
Carlito, man, Death Valley out here, man.

168
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:09,622
Mira, you know me, I take to the street
with any of these motherfuckers, man.

169
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:13,350
But these new kids nowadays, man,
they got no respect for human life.

170
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:16,107
They shotgun you,
just to see you fly up in the air.

171
00:14:16,194 --> 00:14:18,185
'Chacho, you're better off in jail.

172
00:14:18,314 --> 00:14:20,350
I don't even go
up to black Harlem no more.

173
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:23,107
They're fuckin' crazy up there.
Remember Victor?

174
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:26,666
- Victor, with the beard.
- He got shot right in front of the High.

175
00:14:26,754 --> 00:14:29,188
Right in front of fuckin' Patrick Henry High.

176
00:14:29,474 --> 00:14:32,272
- Y Lalin, you know him.
- Lalin Miasso. What happened to him?

177
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:35,949
Lalin's doin' thirty years in Attica, man.
Thirty years!

178
00:14:39,234 --> 00:14:41,828
Walberto! Check it out. Mira who's here.

179
00:14:41,954 --> 00:14:43,865
- Mira, eso. Oye.
- Hey, Wally.

180
00:14:43,954 --> 00:14:46,707
- Heavy-duty.
- Good to see you.

181
00:14:47,194 --> 00:14:49,628
I've been looking all over for you.

182
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:52,873
Should have figured
I'd find you walking around up here...

183
00:14:52,954 --> 00:14:56,390
...doing a little "memory lane."
- While I still got one.

184
00:14:56,474 --> 00:15:00,308
- Mira, Rolando wants to talk to you.
- Carlito, I gotta get back to the game.

185
00:15:00,394 --> 00:15:03,113
You need anything, bodyguard,
anything, call me, okay?

186
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,788
- You call me. Take care.
- Pachanga. Good to see you.

187
00:15:06,394 --> 00:15:09,272
- Rolando?
- S. He's around the corner.

188
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:12,948
Guajiro, wait here for me.

189
00:15:13,034 --> 00:15:15,628
- In about five minutes, I'll be back.
- Sure, Carlito.

190
00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:18,064
Who is that? New back-up man?

191
00:15:18,194 --> 00:15:20,833
He's my little cousin.
I gotta visit my aunt later.

192
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:24,106
Carlito, mi socio.

193
00:15:24,754 --> 00:15:26,107
Qu chvere!

194
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:31,194
I said a prayer for you
while you were inside...

195
00:15:31,314 --> 00:15:33,828
...that harm will come
to him who harmed you.

196
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:36,389
- Thank you.
- Sintate. Sit down.

197
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:42,189
- You are well?
- Well enough.

198
00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:44,870
You look like you're doing good
for yourself.

199
00:15:45,274 --> 00:15:47,310
Why not? Business is good.

200
00:15:47,994 --> 00:15:50,747
- Smack.
- The coca business.

201
00:15:51,474 --> 00:15:53,908
That's all there is. Heroin is dead.

202
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:57,671
- But you know all of this, right?
- No, I didn't know that.

203
00:16:07,514 --> 00:16:09,789
Let's speak the truth between us.

204
00:16:10,794 --> 00:16:13,592
You did five years
and never once mentioned my name.

205
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:17,146
I know that you could have given me up...

206
00:16:17,554 --> 00:16:20,751
...and made things easier for yourself,
but you didn't.

207
00:16:21,074 --> 00:16:23,110
Muy bien hecho. Good for you.

208
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:27,392
But you see I got rich
while you were inside.

209
00:16:27,714 --> 00:16:30,069
Maybe you think I owe you?

210
00:16:31,354 --> 00:16:33,424
I don't want anything from you.

211
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:37,024
- Who are you working with?
- I ain't working with nobody.

212
00:16:37,394 --> 00:16:39,908
- Nobody?
- I'm retired.

213
00:16:40,514 --> 00:16:42,232
- Retired?
- That's right.

214
00:16:42,514 --> 00:16:43,708
Retired?

215
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:47,983
You're serious?

216
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,747
I'm serious. That's right. I'm out. I quit.

217
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:55,990
So, Carlito Brigante got religion, right?

218
00:16:57,234 --> 00:16:59,748
That's right. I'm studying to be a priest.

219
00:17:04,954 --> 00:17:06,672
So what are you doing these days?

220
00:17:06,754 --> 00:17:09,632
Nothing much. I'm still in school.

221
00:17:10,314 --> 00:17:12,111
I got a job though.

222
00:17:12,194 --> 00:17:13,946
No kidding. Doing what?

223
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,992
Just a little legwork
for Seor Pablo Cabrales.

224
00:17:17,434 --> 00:17:19,026
- Cabrales.
- Yeah.

225
00:17:19,274 --> 00:17:22,152
What do you want to do that shit for?
That's not good.

226
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:25,072
Come on, Carlito.
I'm not making a career out of it.

227
00:17:25,154 --> 00:17:27,304
I'm a delivery boy, that's all.

228
00:17:27,554 --> 00:17:29,033
Check this out.

229
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,192
That's $30,000.

230
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:41,870
Can I ask you for a favor?

231
00:17:42,874 --> 00:17:43,989
What's that?

232
00:17:44,194 --> 00:17:47,504
I gotta go down the block for this pickup.
Can you come with me?

233
00:17:48,674 --> 00:17:52,064
Come on. Don't get me involved
with that stuff.

234
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,748
Come on. I know these guys.
They're friends.

235
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:56,392
I just wanna walk in with you.

236
00:17:56,474 --> 00:17:59,591
They see my back-up
and they'll shit in their pants.

237
00:18:00,034 --> 00:18:02,343
- They ain't gonna know me.
- You?

238
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:04,390
You're a fuckin' legend.

239
00:18:05,314 --> 00:18:06,269
Come on.

240
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,190
All right. 10 minutes. I promised
your mother we'd be there for dinner.

241
00:18:12,274 --> 00:18:14,788
That's no problem.
These guys, they're real pros.

242
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:16,307
Boom, boom, in and out.

243
00:18:38,954 --> 00:18:41,468
So the kid's walkin' in there with $30,000.

244
00:18:41,714 --> 00:18:45,229
And the legend, me,
I'm walkin' right in with him.

245
00:18:45,314 --> 00:18:47,782
Five minutes from now
we'll be on the streets...

246
00:18:47,874 --> 00:18:50,513
...with $30,000 worth of very sweet candy...

247
00:18:50,594 --> 00:18:54,109
...more than enough to put me
right back where I just come from.

248
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:57,744
- Cmo est?
- Oye, Quisqueya. Qu pasa?

249
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:01,792
Coo, Guajiro. Who's this?

250
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:05,071
This is my cousin, man.
Primo mo, Carlito Brigante.

251
00:19:05,514 --> 00:19:07,266
You heard of Carlito, right?

252
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,591
What you need him for?

253
00:19:09,754 --> 00:19:13,429
Tranquilo, tranquilo.
I just come along for the ride, man.

254
00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:16,022
Come on, Quisqueya, man.
You know Carlito, right?

255
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,025
I got nothing here.

256
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:20,944
He just got out of Lewisburg, man.

257
00:19:21,274 --> 00:19:23,788
He used to be partners with Rolando Rivas.

258
00:19:25,194 --> 00:19:28,709
Carlito. I heard of you, man.

259
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:32,151
You used to run smack
with Rolando, right?

260
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,988
Little bit.

261
00:19:35,234 --> 00:19:37,748
Little bit? Little bit, that's a good one.

262
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:40,667
I heard you guys were the fucking kings.

263
00:19:43,074 --> 00:19:44,712
Lo siento, Carlito.

264
00:19:45,154 --> 00:19:47,827
Hermanos, take care of Carlito.

265
00:19:48,874 --> 00:19:50,830
We gotta do some business.

266
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,468
Hermanito.

267
00:19:58,354 --> 00:20:00,788
- Quierejugar?
- No, I'll watch.

268
00:20:01,154 --> 00:20:04,032
- We're playing eight ball.
- Good game.

269
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:11,545
- You don't mind if I count it, right?
- It's all there, man.

270
00:20:11,954 --> 00:20:13,626
I'll count it anyway.

271
00:20:14,154 --> 00:20:16,588
- Maybe you'll lose a game.
- Right.

272
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:20,863
- You like that shot I did, right?
- That shot ain't nothin'.

273
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:22,382
Come on.

274
00:20:22,474 --> 00:20:25,034
What're you in a rush for?
I'll beat you again.

275
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,425
- Damn it!
- What's the matter?

276
00:20:30,434 --> 00:20:33,710
- That's your bathroom there?
- That's the bathroom.

277
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:35,348
Don't work.

278
00:20:37,394 --> 00:20:38,986
The toilet's backed up.

279
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:41,153
Sorry, man.

280
00:20:41,794 --> 00:20:43,989
- Don't work?
- No, don't work.

281
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:46,751
I can wait another week.

282
00:20:47,674 --> 00:20:50,472
Come back then, we'll have it fixed for you.

283
00:20:52,554 --> 00:20:54,829
Turn it up! I love that song!

284
00:21:03,314 --> 00:21:05,350
Mira, you wanna play or what?

285
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:09,184
Be cool. I'm rackin', man. Shit.

286
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:20,349
- You got a light?
- Sure, man.

287
00:21:26,714 --> 00:21:28,625
- You're playin' eight ball, right?
- Yeah.

288
00:21:28,714 --> 00:21:31,672
I can't resist this.
I gotta show you people a shot.

289
00:21:31,794 --> 00:21:35,150
- We're in the middle of a game here!
- You're playin' eight ball.

290
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:38,863
Right before you rack. It's nothin'.
It ain't gonna bother your game.

291
00:21:39,354 --> 00:21:42,107
You ain't gonna believe this.
Gonna line 'em up like this.

292
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:46,147
- You gonna show us a trick shot?
- No trick shot. This is magic time.

293
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:51,308
After you see this shot,
you're gonna give up your religious beliefs.

294
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:54,545
Quisqueya, you gotta check this out.

295
00:21:54,634 --> 00:21:57,626
- Carlito's doin' one of his trick shots.
- Guajiro.

296
00:21:58,114 --> 00:22:00,070
I ain't done counting yet.

297
00:22:03,794 --> 00:22:05,989
You want a cold beer, hermano?

298
00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:09,272
Help yourself, man.

299
00:22:09,474 --> 00:22:11,908
- Took me six months to learn this shot.
- Six months?

300
00:22:11,994 --> 00:22:14,110
- You gotta help me though.
- Sure.

301
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:16,589
See this?

302
00:22:16,674 --> 00:22:18,073
- Over the 12.
- Okay.

303
00:22:18,234 --> 00:22:21,909
- So how's your boss?
- He's good. I saw him this morning.

304
00:22:24,514 --> 00:22:28,792
Put your finger right here,
right on top of the 12, to hold it there, see?

305
00:22:29,034 --> 00:22:31,787
- Like that?
- You gotta get it even with that.

306
00:22:39,194 --> 00:22:41,583
- So you didn't hear the news?
- What news?

307
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:44,024
There's no beer down here, man.

308
00:22:44,234 --> 00:22:46,270
Sure, way down in the bottom.

309
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:50,228
Me and Clyde Bassie were working on this.

310
00:22:50,314 --> 00:22:53,272
You lookin' at that nine?
Let me have your cue.

311
00:22:54,194 --> 00:22:55,263
Line 'em up.

312
00:22:56,714 --> 00:22:58,989
- They even?
- They look even to me.

313
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:02,674
Come on, Quisqueya. What news?

314
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:09,745
Your boss is dead and so are you.

315
00:23:59,594 --> 00:24:01,027
I'm reloaded!

316
00:24:04,594 --> 00:24:06,824
Come on in here, motherfuckers!

317
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:11,150
Come on, I'm waitin' for ya!

318
00:24:18,314 --> 00:24:19,747
You ain't comin' in?

319
00:24:21,514 --> 00:24:23,027
I'm comin' out!

320
00:24:25,114 --> 00:24:27,787
You're up against it now, motherfuckers!

321
00:24:28,514 --> 00:24:31,153
I'm gonna blow your fuckin' brains out!

322
00:24:33,154 --> 00:24:35,190
You think you're big time?

323
00:24:35,994 --> 00:24:38,383
You're gonna fuckin' die big time!

324
00:24:43,594 --> 00:24:44,913
You ready?

325
00:24:48,674 --> 00:24:50,346
Here comes the pain!

326
00:25:19,634 --> 00:25:20,908
Oh, Jesus.

327
00:25:21,714 --> 00:25:23,670
Jesus Christ, look at you.

328
00:25:26,514 --> 00:25:28,948
You said they were friends, Guajiro...

329
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:33,191
...but there ain't no friends
in this shit business.

330
00:25:54,194 --> 00:25:55,627
Adis, primo.

331
00:26:00,554 --> 00:26:02,306
All right, what happened?

332
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:12,750
Ain't no more rackets out here...

333
00:26:12,914 --> 00:26:15,747
...just a bunch of cowboys
ripping each other off.

334
00:26:22,434 --> 00:26:25,904
I don't invite this shit. It just comes to me.

335
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:29,264
I run, it runs after me.

336
00:26:30,874 --> 00:26:32,910
Gotta be somewhere to hide.

337
00:26:34,434 --> 00:26:39,030
So I took a look at this, Saso's place.
It's good. It's a nice location.

338
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,551
Somebody ran it right,
it could do good business.

339
00:26:43,074 --> 00:26:45,349
Great. I'll advance you $25,000.

340
00:26:46,074 --> 00:26:48,383
No, I'm gonna put my own money in.

341
00:26:48,954 --> 00:26:51,422
Your own money? What money is that?

342
00:26:51,514 --> 00:26:55,393
I ran into Rolando.
He owed me from an old thing, $25,000...

343
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:58,672
...so, that's the only way
I'm gonna do it, Dave.

344
00:27:00,794 --> 00:27:02,352
You got it. Terrific.

345
00:27:03,074 --> 00:27:05,542
So you'll call Saso,
tell him I'll see him tonight.

346
00:27:05,634 --> 00:27:10,150
Done. I want to talk to you
about something. I need a little favor.

347
00:27:10,274 --> 00:27:13,584
It's no big deal, but I need a bodyguard.
Somebody good.

348
00:27:14,914 --> 00:27:16,825
Who's bothering you? I know 'em?

349
00:27:17,954 --> 00:27:20,422
It's no big deal.
Just a little misunderstanding.

350
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:23,074
If it's no big deal,
what do you need a bodyguard for?

351
00:27:23,354 --> 00:27:25,743
Will you trust me on this?
It's just temporary.

352
00:27:25,834 --> 00:27:29,383
I'll get someone of my own later,
but I want someone right away.

353
00:27:30,114 --> 00:27:34,505
There's Pachanga,
one of the old barrio crowd. He's good.

354
00:27:35,714 --> 00:27:36,829
Great.

355
00:27:37,874 --> 00:27:39,193
You okay?

356
00:27:43,114 --> 00:27:44,945
I got a good feeling about this club.

357
00:27:45,034 --> 00:27:47,423
I think we're gonna make
some real money.

358
00:27:48,874 --> 00:27:50,944
I got a good feeling about it too...

359
00:27:51,194 --> 00:27:53,150
...but as soon as I make my $75,000...

360
00:27:54,274 --> 00:27:55,627
...I'm splittin'.

361
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:57,553
That's right.

362
00:27:57,954 --> 00:28:01,185
You're gonna rent Ford Pintos
to tourists in Paradise.

363
00:28:01,274 --> 00:28:04,152
That's right,
with a big smile on my face, too.

364
00:29:02,154 --> 00:29:03,792
Times have changed.

365
00:29:04,194 --> 00:29:06,185
What happened to the miniskirts?

366
00:29:06,274 --> 00:29:08,310
Where's all that marijuana?

367
00:29:08,554 --> 00:29:13,184
Now everything is platforms, cocaine,
and dances I don't dance.

368
00:29:13,954 --> 00:29:16,991
What a man gotta come to
when he loses five years.

369
00:29:17,914 --> 00:29:21,111
But some shit never changes, like Saso.

370
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:25,348
Charlie, my friend! Charlie Brigante!
How you doing?

371
00:29:25,554 --> 00:29:26,748
Hey, Saso.

372
00:29:26,994 --> 00:29:30,031
No, no more Saso.
Now everybody calls me Ron.

373
00:29:30,514 --> 00:29:32,948
- Ron?
- Ron from Reinaldo.

374
00:29:34,394 --> 00:29:36,703
Okay, Ron, let's get to the point.

375
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:39,663
I hear you're doing good business
with this place.

376
00:29:39,754 --> 00:29:41,984
- Very good.
- So how come you need money?

377
00:29:42,274 --> 00:29:44,424
- Me?
- You gamblin' again, right?

378
00:29:44,514 --> 00:29:45,913
How much you owe?

379
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:50,708
I don't know, maybe $50,000 or $60,000.

380
00:29:51,194 --> 00:29:53,992
That means about $100,000.
Who you owe the money to?

381
00:29:54,074 --> 00:29:56,190
You know, Charles, some of the boys.

382
00:29:56,354 --> 00:30:01,030
$25,000 will quiet them for now,
and you'll come in for a quarter of my end.

383
00:30:01,554 --> 00:30:05,103
Okay, I'm gonna give you
$25,000 cash tomorrow.

384
00:30:05,434 --> 00:30:07,470
I'm gonna come in for half your end.

385
00:30:09,114 --> 00:30:10,866
What are you trying to do to me?

386
00:30:10,954 --> 00:30:15,311
What I'm trying to do, Saso,
I mean Ron, is save your ass.

387
00:30:16,234 --> 00:30:20,227
Right, because it's either Fat Anthony
or Scooze you owe the money to, right?

388
00:30:20,314 --> 00:30:23,112
Either way, you're gonna end up
in the trunk of a car...

389
00:30:23,194 --> 00:30:25,389
...somewhere on the Belt Parkway
before long.

390
00:30:25,474 --> 00:30:28,546
May be weeks before they find you.
Like DeeDee.

391
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:30,864
Remember? They open her up.

392
00:30:31,314 --> 00:30:33,703
That's some kind of stink
you're gonna make.

393
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:37,471
"What's that smell?" Saso, man.

394
00:30:37,554 --> 00:30:40,273
That's Saso. Used to be Ron.

395
00:30:41,034 --> 00:30:43,229
Okay, okay. What time tomorrow?

396
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:49,588
So here's me in the club
playing Humphrey Bogart.

397
00:30:49,994 --> 00:30:54,272
Things can get very sticky after hours,
so I bring in Pachanga...

398
00:30:54,714 --> 00:30:56,352
...little extra back-up.

399
00:30:56,474 --> 00:30:58,590
He thinks I'm gonna make him rich...

400
00:30:58,714 --> 00:31:01,786
...so he's worried I'm gonna get killed
before he scores.

401
00:31:01,874 --> 00:31:04,547
I heard about that shit with your cousin.

402
00:31:04,634 --> 00:31:07,102
Why didn't you call me
so I could watch your ass?

403
00:31:07,194 --> 00:31:09,754
That happened a month ago.
You just found out?

404
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:13,190
You got me chasin' Kleinberg
in the daytime and then you got me here...

405
00:31:13,274 --> 00:31:17,267
Kleinfeld! I hope you're doin' a better job
with him than you are with me.

406
00:31:17,554 --> 00:31:18,987
The guy got a lot of money.

407
00:31:19,074 --> 00:31:22,305
He got a safe in the office
with stacks of hundreds just waitin'...

408
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:25,272
Kleinfeld is my brother. Look at me.

409
00:31:26,354 --> 00:31:27,912
He is my brother.

410
00:31:28,194 --> 00:31:29,991
Pachanga's only fuckin' around.

411
00:31:30,074 --> 00:31:32,190
Don't fuck around.
Just keep your eyes open.

412
00:31:32,274 --> 00:31:34,026
Watch the bar. They're stealin' money.

413
00:31:34,114 --> 00:31:37,265
I wanna try, but it's so dark in here.
What do you want me to do?

414
00:31:37,954 --> 00:31:40,787
The guy over there says
he don't have to pay.

415
00:31:41,194 --> 00:31:44,152
- What guy is that?
- The guy in the red over there.

416
00:31:48,314 --> 00:31:49,463
What are you doin'?

417
00:31:49,554 --> 00:31:51,909
- Shut up and kiss me.
- Excuse me.

418
00:31:52,514 --> 00:31:56,029
- Something wrong with the check?
- Yeah, there's something wrong with it.

419
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,105
- Baby, come on...
- Mira!

420
00:31:58,994 --> 00:32:00,791
- Benny!
- What, man?

421
00:32:01,194 --> 00:32:05,267
Shit. Fuck. Shit, man.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brigante.

422
00:32:05,354 --> 00:32:07,310
I'm sorry. I got no problem.

423
00:32:07,394 --> 00:32:11,103
See, Fat Man Saso there owes me money
and he's a little slow in paying me.

424
00:32:11,194 --> 00:32:14,584
So I'm just working it off for him.
We haven't been formally introduced.

425
00:32:14,674 --> 00:32:17,905
- My name is Benny Blanco from the Bronx.
- You know me?

426
00:32:17,994 --> 00:32:21,270
I know you. You're Carlito Brigante,
motherfucker-to-the-max.

427
00:32:21,674 --> 00:32:25,508
I don't know you.
So I don't owe you. Saso does.

428
00:32:26,034 --> 00:32:28,104
My place now, new rules.

429
00:32:28,634 --> 00:32:30,784
Everybody pays. Okay?

430
00:32:31,634 --> 00:32:33,352
Okay. That's cool, that's groovy.

431
00:32:33,434 --> 00:32:37,222
What's the matter with you?
Pay the fuckin' goddamn check, bitch.

432
00:32:37,314 --> 00:32:39,748
- To the waiter.
- To the waiter, you dumb fuck!

433
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:42,587
And get us some champagne,
some of that French shit.

434
00:32:43,314 --> 00:32:44,542
Have a glass, man.

435
00:32:44,674 --> 00:32:46,904
- No, thank you...
- I wanna pick your brain.

436
00:32:46,994 --> 00:32:48,746
Get him a chair. The man is standing!

437
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:51,428
Get him a chair.
Get the stupid look off your face.

438
00:32:51,514 --> 00:32:53,584
You know who this man is?

439
00:32:53,874 --> 00:32:57,708
This man here, he's the fuckin' J.P. Morgan
of the smack business.

440
00:32:58,314 --> 00:32:59,872
First time I ever heard that.

441
00:32:59,954 --> 00:33:03,663
Come on, man. You had 90, 100 guys
on the street. Right?

442
00:33:03,754 --> 00:33:06,427
- Something like that.
- I'm starting out small.

443
00:33:06,514 --> 00:33:08,186
I'm just building my organization.

444
00:33:08,274 --> 00:33:10,742
I'm refining it
and maximizing my potentialities.

445
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:13,348
I got my finger on some shit
that's about to explode.

446
00:33:13,434 --> 00:33:15,106
If you can just give me two minutes...

447
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:18,231
- Maybe next time. All the best to ya.
- Two minutes of your time.

448
00:33:18,314 --> 00:33:19,793
I'll talk to you again.

449
00:33:21,514 --> 00:33:24,233
Just two minutes. That's all.

450
00:33:25,114 --> 00:33:26,547
Fucking kids.

451
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:30,184
Move a couple of ounces,
think they're a big shot.

452
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:33,951
Make a few bucks while I'm in the joint,
I gotta respect 'em.

453
00:33:34,194 --> 00:33:36,264
- Fuck that.
- Yeah, fuck that shit.

454
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:40,826
Talk to me about this.

455
00:33:54,474 --> 00:33:58,262
Carlito, I see you was talkin'
to Benny Blanco before.

456
00:34:04,234 --> 00:34:05,872
Benny Blanco from the Bronx.

457
00:34:06,154 --> 00:34:08,622
- They say he's comin' up in the world.
- Do they?

458
00:34:09,074 --> 00:34:10,473
He's got a big future...

459
00:34:10,914 --> 00:34:12,870
...if he can live past next week.

460
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:18,432
How come a good-Iookin' dude like you...

461
00:34:18,914 --> 00:34:20,393
...doesn't have a woman?

462
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:23,466
Well, I guess I'm a workaholic.

463
00:34:25,874 --> 00:34:27,466
What's the matter?

464
00:34:27,554 --> 00:34:29,988
Don't you ever see nobody
you like in here?

465
00:34:32,514 --> 00:34:34,232
Nobody but you, Stef.

466
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:41,385
Jesus, she looks like Gail.

467
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:44,673
Same color hair. The way she dances.

468
00:34:45,954 --> 00:34:48,866
I met Gail a year before
I went into thejoint.

469
00:34:49,394 --> 00:34:52,352
She was this dancer,
this artistic ballet-type...

470
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:54,949
...was gonna be a big Broadway star.

471
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:57,185
I guess she fell in love.

472
00:34:57,514 --> 00:35:02,269
Me too. I swore I'd never break her heart,
but, you know, things happen.

473
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:05,946
I miss you, Gail.

474
00:35:44,154 --> 00:35:47,305
When you're in thejoint
you spend all your time...

475
00:35:47,474 --> 00:35:50,910
...dopin' out who you're gonna see
the first day you're out.

476
00:35:51,154 --> 00:35:53,304
The second day. The third.

477
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:58,506
But then you get out, everybody's got
a different face than you remember.

478
00:35:59,594 --> 00:36:01,186
Maybe you do too.

479
00:36:01,514 --> 00:36:04,233
You pray for one face that didn't change.

480
00:36:06,154 --> 00:36:08,304
One face that still knows you...

481
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:12,273
...looks at you the same way it always did.

482
00:38:00,554 --> 00:38:03,990
I couldn't figure it out.
I couldn't get that thing to save my life.

483
00:38:04,914 --> 00:38:06,666
- Bye, Gail.
- See you next week.

484
00:38:06,754 --> 00:38:08,631
- I know you, lady.
- Buzz off.

485
00:38:09,314 --> 00:38:11,589
Sure, you used to go out with that guy.

486
00:38:11,674 --> 00:38:14,029
What's his name? That good-Iooking guy.

487
00:38:14,714 --> 00:38:18,024
Yeah, Carlito Brigante. That's right.

488
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,553
Hello, Gail.

489
00:38:34,674 --> 00:38:39,225
I was in the road company
of this show called Songbird last year.

490
00:38:39,354 --> 00:38:41,663
I played the Governor's daughter.

491
00:38:41,874 --> 00:38:44,707
It wasn't the lead, but it was a great part.

492
00:38:45,314 --> 00:38:48,989
And I did this musical book show
last year in Vegas.

493
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:53,105
I hated the weather. You ever been there?

494
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:56,746
Vegas? Yeah.
So are you in something now?

495
00:38:56,914 --> 00:38:58,950
I can come downtown and see you.

496
00:38:59,274 --> 00:39:04,064
I'm just, you know, doing club dates
right now, mostly one-nighters though.

497
00:39:05,074 --> 00:39:08,783
But I'm up for this play that goes this fall...

498
00:39:09,154 --> 00:39:10,303
That's great.

499
00:39:10,594 --> 00:39:13,347
You're livin' what
you always dreamed about.

500
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:17,587
I'm getting close.

501
00:39:17,674 --> 00:39:21,110
I am getting close.
I'm not there yet, but it's okay.

502
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:29,711
What was it like inside?

503
00:39:31,794 --> 00:39:33,193
No big thing.

504
00:39:34,714 --> 00:39:37,990
A lot of push-ups. A lot of wasted time.

505
00:39:39,434 --> 00:39:42,904
- You're out now.
- Yeah. Here I am.

506
00:39:47,954 --> 00:39:52,152
Am I outta line? Just poppin' up like this
after all these years?

507
00:39:53,634 --> 00:39:55,511
You still pissed at me?

508
00:39:58,954 --> 00:40:00,592
What do you think?

509
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:05,150
You dumped me hard, Charlie.

510
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:11,314
Now you want to tell me
it was for my own good, right?

511
00:40:11,394 --> 00:40:15,387
No, it was for mine. It was for mine.

512
00:40:15,554 --> 00:40:18,193
It was for my own good.
I was doin' thirty years.

513
00:40:18,274 --> 00:40:21,744
What was I supposed to do? I knew
you were gonna try and wait for me.

514
00:40:21,834 --> 00:40:25,065
You were gonna visit me,
make me think about you all the time.

515
00:40:25,154 --> 00:40:28,783
Now what was I supposed to do?
There I am sittin' in jail...

516
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,233
...wonderin' all the time where you are...

517
00:40:32,314 --> 00:40:34,703
...what you're doin', who you're with.

518
00:40:34,914 --> 00:40:36,905
That'd have drove me crazy.

519
00:40:37,154 --> 00:40:39,384
It'd have killed me. Believe me.

520
00:40:43,114 --> 00:40:46,026
Best to just cut it clean, you know?

521
00:40:47,234 --> 00:40:49,304
Do my time with a clear head.

522
00:40:50,914 --> 00:40:53,189
So, now what?

523
00:40:58,234 --> 00:41:02,466
Now what? I don't know.
I'm here. I'm out.

524
00:41:03,674 --> 00:41:05,585
For whatever that's worth.

525
00:41:07,514 --> 00:41:09,709
What about this club of yours?

526
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:13,822
It's not my club, you know.
I just got a piece of it.

527
00:41:14,354 --> 00:41:16,663
Just trying to make enough money...

528
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:22,464
With my luck,
somebody's gonna get shot...

529
00:41:22,554 --> 00:41:25,751
...the cops are gonna come
and close it down, you know.

530
00:41:28,914 --> 00:41:30,950
That doesn't sound like you.

531
00:41:31,994 --> 00:41:33,905
It doesn't? Really?

532
00:41:34,874 --> 00:41:37,024
You never talked like this before.

533
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:39,150
Never felt like this before.

534
00:41:40,794 --> 00:41:42,466
It's a funny thing.

535
00:41:42,874 --> 00:41:46,184
This guy, this counselor at Lewisburg...

536
00:41:46,274 --> 00:41:48,629
...Mr. Seawald, once said to me:

537
00:41:49,554 --> 00:41:52,591
"Charlie, you run out of steam.

538
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:57,190
"You can't sprint all the way.
You gotta stop sometime.

539
00:41:58,194 --> 00:42:01,231
"You can't buck it forever.
It catches up to you.

540
00:42:02,074 --> 00:42:03,393
"It gets you.

541
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:08,071
"You don't get reformed...

542
00:42:09,674 --> 00:42:11,585
"...you just run out of wind."

543
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:26,227
I'd better go.

544
00:42:29,594 --> 00:42:31,505
Can I call you sometime?

545
00:42:33,474 --> 00:42:35,669
Why don't you let me call you?

546
00:42:39,314 --> 00:42:42,112
- You know where to find me, right?
- Yeah.

547
00:43:00,394 --> 00:43:02,862
You said you wouldn't break my heart.

548
00:43:06,634 --> 00:43:08,864
I know. I'm sorry.

549
00:43:13,634 --> 00:43:14,908
I'm sorry.

550
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:23,153
Good night.

551
00:44:02,834 --> 00:44:05,223
Mr. Taglialucci to see his lawyer,
Mr. Kleinfeld.

552
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,662
Go ahead.

553
00:44:08,634 --> 00:44:10,352
Tony, how are you?

554
00:44:11,354 --> 00:44:14,630
- Okay, Jackson, beat it.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Taglialucci.

555
00:44:17,634 --> 00:44:19,067
You look good.

556
00:44:19,554 --> 00:44:23,388
Don't make me do it, Kleinfeld.
Just write this down, all right?

557
00:44:24,394 --> 00:44:28,023
It's 555-5888.

558
00:44:29,154 --> 00:44:31,270
That's my kid Frankie's
home phone number...

559
00:44:31,354 --> 00:44:33,390
...and I'll tell you why in a minute.

560
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:36,868
Shut up!

561
00:44:44,914 --> 00:44:48,429
I never liked you, Kleinfeld.
Not 'cause you're a Jew.

562
00:44:48,914 --> 00:44:52,065
I know plenty of Jews.
It's 'cause you're a lyin' piece of shit.

563
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:56,512
Now, I give you a million bucks to make
a simple payoff and nothin' happens.

564
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:59,233
Look, I told your son
I gave Nicky the money personally.

565
00:44:59,314 --> 00:45:02,306
If he decides to betray that
and testify against you anyway...

566
00:45:02,394 --> 00:45:05,113
...I can hardly be...
- You look at my hands.

567
00:45:05,394 --> 00:45:09,751
Now, you make me raise my voice
and I'll snap your neck like a bread stick.

568
00:45:10,634 --> 00:45:13,148
You fuckin' phony.
What do you take me for?

569
00:45:13,474 --> 00:45:15,704
Nicky never saw dollar one of my money.

570
00:45:15,874 --> 00:45:18,832
My million bucks went straight
into your pockets.

571
00:45:19,194 --> 00:45:22,869
- I personally...
- Don't fuckin' lie to me, you scumbag.

572
00:45:22,954 --> 00:45:26,469
You lie to me again,
you're gonna end up in that river out there.

573
00:45:26,954 --> 00:45:30,151
You think about this when you go out,
and you'll take a look down...

574
00:45:30,274 --> 00:45:32,185
...and imagine what it'll feel like...

575
00:45:32,274 --> 00:45:36,904
...slidin' around down the bottom with eels
and crabs crawlin' outta your eyeballs.

576
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:44,507
What do you want from me?

577
00:45:45,714 --> 00:45:49,627
- I understand you got a boat.
- Yeah.

578
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:54,190
- You're gonna get me outta here.
- I'm doing every...

579
00:45:54,514 --> 00:45:57,074
My entire office is devoted
to your appeal right now.

580
00:45:57,154 --> 00:46:00,624
- I talked to the judge this morning.
- I ain't talkin' about no appeal.

581
00:46:00,714 --> 00:46:03,148
I'm talkin' about you bustin' me outta here.

582
00:46:08,674 --> 00:46:09,629
I'm a lawyer.

583
00:46:09,754 --> 00:46:13,463
Listen, you lawyer-fuck,
I got a million-dollar credit with you.

584
00:46:14,194 --> 00:46:16,992
My kid Frankie'll go with you
and keep an eye on you...

585
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:18,792
...make sure everything goes right.

586
00:46:18,874 --> 00:46:21,593
You see that guard
that brought me in here?

587
00:46:21,914 --> 00:46:25,873
He's been taken care of, and he's gonna
set it up to get me into the water.

588
00:46:26,194 --> 00:46:30,426
All you gotta do is be there
with the boat to pick me up.

589
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,830
This is not exactly the kind of...

590
00:46:35,914 --> 00:46:37,905
The contract's already down on you, pal.

591
00:46:38,394 --> 00:46:41,545
The guys, the guns,
the lime pit's already dug.

592
00:46:41,634 --> 00:46:45,752
You understand?
And from in here, just one button I push.

593
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:24,265
What?

594
00:47:24,354 --> 00:47:26,663
Mr. Norwalk from
the District Attorney's office.

595
00:47:27,674 --> 00:47:29,266
I said no calls!

596
00:47:29,434 --> 00:47:30,867
No, he's here.

597
00:47:37,874 --> 00:47:39,353
Mr. Kleinfeld?

598
00:47:39,794 --> 00:47:41,512
Give me a second, please.

599
00:47:48,314 --> 00:47:51,272
- Mr. Kleinfeld, are you there?
- Send him in.

600
00:47:59,874 --> 00:48:01,432
How are you?

601
00:48:01,994 --> 00:48:05,543
- Good to see you. Have a seat.
- Hope you don't mind. I was in the area.

602
00:48:05,634 --> 00:48:08,910
Not at all. As a matter of fact,
I was about to call you.

603
00:48:12,794 --> 00:48:15,183
Your problems aren't just
going to go away.

604
00:48:34,474 --> 00:48:37,352
Here's me in the club countin' every dollar.

605
00:48:38,394 --> 00:48:42,626
On top of the $25,000 I put in,
I already pulled out another $14,000.

606
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:48,393
$35,000 or $40,000 more,
and I'm gone, daddy, gone.

607
00:48:48,954 --> 00:48:50,831
Two, maybe three months.

608
00:48:52,354 --> 00:48:54,265
Just gotta mark time now...

609
00:48:54,554 --> 00:48:56,749
...lie low, keep outta trouble...

610
00:48:57,474 --> 00:48:59,305
...and off people's minds.

611
00:49:02,554 --> 00:49:04,545
Lalin is here. In the office.

612
00:49:04,634 --> 00:49:07,068
- Lalin?
- You wanna see him?

613
00:49:07,474 --> 00:49:10,989
- You told me he was doin' thirty years.
- I guess he got out.

614
00:49:12,114 --> 00:49:15,186
- How's he doin'?
- Not as good as you, but, you know...

615
00:49:15,274 --> 00:49:16,992
I don't know what that means.

616
00:49:18,954 --> 00:49:22,947
Lalin was a neighborhood guy,
real good-lookin' son of a bitch.

617
00:49:23,034 --> 00:49:26,629
He used to work in
this private gamblingjoint on West 87th.

618
00:49:26,914 --> 00:49:30,953
He was kind of a greeter for the place,
set guys up with broads.

619
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:34,268
Now anybody ask me about Lalin...

620
00:49:34,994 --> 00:49:37,952
...I have to say, he's a stand-up guy.

621
00:49:47,474 --> 00:49:50,193
- Look at you, man, look at you.
- Hey, hermano.

622
00:49:50,274 --> 00:49:52,549
How you doin', man? What a place.

623
00:49:52,714 --> 00:49:54,432
What happened to you?

624
00:49:55,074 --> 00:49:57,110
What do you mean? You didn't hear?

625
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:59,705
I took a few in the back.

626
00:50:00,474 --> 00:50:03,591
When the street's really mad at you,
she don't put you in a box...

627
00:50:03,674 --> 00:50:05,665
...she puts you in one of these things.

628
00:50:07,314 --> 00:50:10,590
-  Tu quieres?
- No. I'm workin'.

629
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:14,064
- How about a drink? You want one?
- Like you wouldn't believe.

630
00:50:17,834 --> 00:50:20,302
Pachanga, tell me what's goin' on up there.

631
00:50:20,514 --> 00:50:22,027
Come on, man, tell me.

632
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:25,753
Take care, all right?

633
00:50:28,474 --> 00:50:31,272
I seen that chick
you used to go around with.

634
00:50:33,354 --> 00:50:34,753
The one from the Bahamas.

635
00:50:34,834 --> 00:50:37,587
You know, la rubia.
The one that looks like my sister.

636
00:50:37,674 --> 00:50:38,743
That's Gail.

637
00:50:39,554 --> 00:50:42,432
I seen her in this show
on 48th and Broadway.

638
00:50:43,114 --> 00:50:44,547
When was this?

639
00:50:45,394 --> 00:50:48,113
Two weeks ago.
She was in this fantastic show.

640
00:50:48,194 --> 00:50:53,427
I mean, like artistic, you know,
but a lot of talent.

641
00:50:54,194 --> 00:50:56,230
That girl's got a lot of talent.

642
00:50:57,274 --> 00:50:58,627
48th and Broadway?

643
00:51:02,034 --> 00:51:03,945
Let me get another drink.

644
00:51:05,234 --> 00:51:08,829
So, you back in business?

645
00:51:09,434 --> 00:51:13,632
I'm retired, Lalin. Told you that.
No more business for me.

646
00:51:15,314 --> 00:51:19,466
Come on. All them people in Lewisburg
and you're telling me you didn't connect?

647
00:51:19,874 --> 00:51:23,913
I did a lot of reading.
Worked on my appeal, that kind of thing.

648
00:51:25,034 --> 00:51:27,025
What about you? What is this?

649
00:51:27,314 --> 00:51:29,669
Pachanga told me
you was doin' thirty years.

650
00:51:30,874 --> 00:51:32,512
Yeah. Beat it.

651
00:51:33,114 --> 00:51:35,184
You beat it? How'd you do that?

652
00:51:37,234 --> 00:51:39,543
You know, like you, I did a lot of reading...

653
00:51:39,634 --> 00:51:43,149
...and I worked with some guys,
some smart guys in the joint...

654
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:45,590
...and just beat it, that's all.

655
00:51:45,914 --> 00:51:48,064
No shit. That's good.

656
00:51:49,194 --> 00:51:50,309
Here's to you.

657
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,992
To you. "Free at last."

658
00:51:58,114 --> 00:52:02,869
Listen, I'm in with some new people now.
Unos italianos, t sabes.

659
00:52:02,954 --> 00:52:05,514
They trust you.
They think you're a fuckin' guinea.

660
00:52:05,594 --> 00:52:08,586
- Where are they from? Pleasant Avenue?
- Downtown.

661
00:52:08,794 --> 00:52:11,672
Anyway, they got the money.
They got a lot of money.

662
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:15,872
Some heavy paper. They go up to $25,000
for a key, if it's good shit, you know.

663
00:52:15,954 --> 00:52:20,789
They want regular street people,
gente del barrio. Old school all the way.

664
00:52:20,874 --> 00:52:24,549
- Stand-up guys like us, right, Lalin?
- Old school, baby.

665
00:52:24,634 --> 00:52:27,626
So what you say? You and me,
just like old times.

666
00:52:27,714 --> 00:52:29,830
You bring the people you're with now.

667
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:34,624
I ain't with nobody. I told you that.
I ain't connected no more.

668
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:38,630
Come on, man!
You forget who you're talking to?

669
00:52:54,314 --> 00:52:55,872
- Look at this.
- Wait a minute.

670
00:52:55,954 --> 00:52:59,151
This how you beat your thirty years,
you piece of shit?

671
00:52:59,314 --> 00:53:02,465
- Let me explain.
- I'll kill you, you motherfucker.

672
00:53:02,754 --> 00:53:06,633
- Fuckin' push you in the fuckin' river!
- What the fuck is goin' on?

673
00:53:06,754 --> 00:53:09,473
Wait a minute. Wait a fuckin' second!

674
00:53:09,554 --> 00:53:14,548
You a fuckin' chivo, man?
You a fuckin' rat? I'll fuckin' kill him!

675
00:53:14,634 --> 00:53:16,511
Let me kill him for you!

676
00:53:16,674 --> 00:53:19,063
Let him fuckin' kill me! Fuck you!

677
00:53:19,234 --> 00:53:21,702
Kill me, you motherfucker!
Look what I got!

678
00:53:22,234 --> 00:53:25,749
I mean, look at me! You got everything!

679
00:53:26,234 --> 00:53:27,792
I mean, come on!

680
00:53:28,514 --> 00:53:32,302
Look what I gotta fucking go around with:
fucking diapers!

681
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:35,348
I got fucking diapers!
I shit in my pants every day!

682
00:53:35,434 --> 00:53:37,425
I can't walk, I can't hump.

683
00:53:39,314 --> 00:53:41,828
Go ahead and kill me, you cocksucker!

684
00:53:48,514 --> 00:53:51,665
They made me do it, or they send me back.

685
00:53:51,754 --> 00:53:54,666
I'm no good in the joint.
I'm in a fucking wheelchair.

686
00:54:00,234 --> 00:54:03,465
- It wasn't even turned on.
- Who sent you? Listen to me now.

687
00:54:03,954 --> 00:54:05,387
Who sent you?

688
00:54:06,474 --> 00:54:09,068
- Who sent you, motherfucker?
- The D.A.

689
00:54:09,154 --> 00:54:10,348
Norwalk?

690
00:54:12,074 --> 00:54:15,987
- Norwalk?
- He got a hard-on for you, man.

691
00:54:16,114 --> 00:54:18,423
Got a tip you were dealing again, big time.

692
00:54:18,514 --> 00:54:20,982
I was dealing? Who told him that?

693
00:54:21,074 --> 00:54:24,510
I been clean. I haven't made
one fuckin' move. Who told him that?

694
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,425
- I don't know.
- Who told him that?

695
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:28,903
Man, I swear to God, I don't know!

696
00:54:32,794 --> 00:54:36,150
I would never give you up.
I would never do that.

697
00:54:36,234 --> 00:54:37,872
I was gonna give you a signal.

698
00:54:37,954 --> 00:54:41,549
It wasn't even turned on.
It's something else, man!

699
00:54:42,274 --> 00:54:43,707
Look, let me...

700
00:54:46,034 --> 00:54:48,548
Just do it, man! Just fuckin' kill me.

701
00:54:49,634 --> 00:54:51,465
I ain't gonna kill you.

702
00:54:55,234 --> 00:54:57,509
I ain't even gonna hurt you.

703
00:55:01,034 --> 00:55:02,308
I ask you...

704
00:55:03,794 --> 00:55:07,628
...how can you fuck the only people
who ever cared for you?

705
00:55:08,594 --> 00:55:10,710
How do you do that?

706
00:55:12,514 --> 00:55:14,311
You lost, motherfucker.

707
00:55:16,554 --> 00:55:18,704
I'm gonna get somebody to wheel you out.

708
00:55:18,794 --> 00:55:20,352
Djame explicar...

709
00:55:24,714 --> 00:55:27,831
Some fuck told Norwalk
I was dealin' again.

710
00:55:30,874 --> 00:55:32,068
Come in.

711
00:55:35,114 --> 00:55:36,991
Do you know who it was?

712
00:55:39,474 --> 00:55:43,387
All I know is he sent somebody
to talk to me wearin' a wire.

713
00:55:43,514 --> 00:55:45,186
That son of a bitch.

714
00:55:45,714 --> 00:55:47,944
He's been leaning on me too,
about other shit.

715
00:55:48,034 --> 00:55:52,232
I ain't dealin'. I ain't goin'
back to prison no matter what!

716
00:55:52,754 --> 00:55:56,906
Relax. You're not dealing,
so he can't have anything on you.

717
00:55:57,114 --> 00:56:00,743
This is the way this guy is.
He's on a goddamn fishing expedition.

718
00:56:00,834 --> 00:56:03,507
I'll take care of it. All right? Come on.

719
00:56:06,314 --> 00:56:07,952
Fuckin' Lalin, man.

720
00:56:09,634 --> 00:56:10,828
He has nobody.

721
00:56:12,194 --> 00:56:13,673
He has nobody left.

722
00:56:29,994 --> 00:56:32,508
How about you, sir? Check it out, man.

723
00:56:33,114 --> 00:56:35,753
What's up, man? Check it out.
What's happenin', man?

724
00:56:35,834 --> 00:56:38,109
Cool, man. Take that.

725
00:58:31,234 --> 00:58:32,633
This is a surprise.

726
00:58:33,554 --> 00:58:34,782
Big surprise.

727
00:58:35,474 --> 00:58:36,953
Diet Pepsi.

728
00:58:41,234 --> 00:58:44,783
You were really terrific.

729
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:46,990
- I mean, really...
- Thanks.

730
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,834
...very, how do I say...

731
00:58:51,634 --> 00:58:52,749
Sexy?

732
00:58:53,434 --> 00:58:56,426
- Exactly.
- That is the desired effect.

733
00:58:56,514 --> 00:59:01,713
- Miss, that was just wonderful!
- Really, really wonderful!

734
00:59:01,794 --> 00:59:04,592
- Thank you very much.
- Really, really wonderful.

735
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,107
Thanks a lot.

736
00:59:09,794 --> 00:59:10,829
Fans.

737
00:59:18,034 --> 00:59:19,626
What's the matter?

738
00:59:21,394 --> 00:59:23,783
Nothin'. No, I was just...

739
00:59:26,954 --> 00:59:28,990
This situation, I think, maybe is...

740
00:59:29,074 --> 00:59:31,463
Situation?

741
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:36,105
I didn't expect this kind of thing.
That's all.

742
00:59:36,634 --> 00:59:40,309
I mean, you told me you was
in a musical of some sort.

743
00:59:40,954 --> 00:59:43,149
I thought you was doin' a Broadway show.

744
00:59:43,234 --> 00:59:46,192
You told me the Governor's daughter,
whatever you were playing.

745
00:59:46,274 --> 00:59:48,026
And I come here and see this.

746
00:59:48,954 --> 00:59:51,149
Not that there's anything wrong with this.

747
00:59:51,274 --> 00:59:53,504
Wait a second. I work hard here.

748
00:59:54,034 --> 00:59:59,313
I dance. I get well-paid for it.
I don't fuck anybody.

749
00:59:59,714 --> 01:00:02,182
I didn't say that. Now, please.

750
01:00:02,274 --> 01:00:04,629
You're sitting there judging me.

751
01:00:04,714 --> 01:00:07,626
I'm not judgin' you. Please don't say that.

752
01:00:07,914 --> 01:00:12,351
I don't judge you.
What do you do that's so wonderful?

753
01:00:12,634 --> 01:00:14,864
You ever kill anybody, Charlie?

754
01:00:24,234 --> 01:00:26,589
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

755
01:00:27,474 --> 01:00:30,705
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
just busted in like this.

756
01:00:32,434 --> 01:00:35,631
My fault. I apologize.

757
01:00:38,594 --> 01:00:39,709
I better go now.

758
01:00:39,794 --> 01:00:41,910
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna go home.

759
01:00:41,994 --> 01:00:43,905
When am I gonna see you again?

760
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:46,668
Why don't you surprise me another time?

761
01:00:48,234 --> 01:00:51,590
- Like when?
- I can't tell you that.

762
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:55,793
- Why not?
- 'Cause it wouldn't be a surprise, would it?

763
01:01:02,674 --> 01:01:04,949
You know I want to feel your ass.

764
01:01:05,514 --> 01:01:06,947
You already know my ass.

765
01:01:14,194 --> 01:01:15,343
Come with me.

766
01:01:24,834 --> 01:01:27,348
What the fuck are you lookin' at me for?

767
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:28,992
- Benny!
- How ya doin'?

768
01:01:32,514 --> 01:01:35,711
- Benny Blanco from the Bronx!
- Hey, fat man.

769
01:01:35,834 --> 01:01:37,392
The fattest man.

770
01:01:38,154 --> 01:01:40,190
- Where's my money?
- What money?

771
01:01:40,274 --> 01:01:43,186
My money, man! You play pussy,
you gonna get fucked!

772
01:01:43,354 --> 01:01:44,707
Are you kidding?

773
01:01:46,514 --> 01:01:47,993
- Where's Steffie?
- Steffie?

774
01:01:48,074 --> 01:01:50,304
Get me Steffie, man. I'm Ionely.

775
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:52,790
- S. Dgame.
- Dnde est Steffie?

776
01:01:52,994 --> 01:01:55,588
- Yo la vi por ah.
- Vete a buscarla ya.

777
01:01:56,834 --> 01:01:58,028
Muy bien.

778
01:02:23,194 --> 01:02:24,673
Madre de Dios!

779
01:02:25,714 --> 01:02:28,433
After that, she got six fucking kids.

780
01:02:29,074 --> 01:02:32,384
There is a problem with Mr. Kleinfeld.

781
01:02:32,794 --> 01:02:36,389
- What kind of problem?
- He's in the bathroom fucking Steffie.

782
01:02:37,434 --> 01:02:40,426
So, what's the problem? Good for him.

783
01:02:40,634 --> 01:02:43,068
But she belongs to Benny Blanco now.

784
01:02:43,474 --> 01:02:44,145
Who?

785
01:02:44,434 --> 01:02:46,664
You remember Benny Blanco
from the Bronx?

786
01:02:46,754 --> 01:02:50,429
- That little piece of shit from the other day.
- Not that guy. Fuck him.

787
01:02:50,554 --> 01:02:53,751
He's here, and he's gonna make trouble.

788
01:02:53,834 --> 01:02:55,631
- Where is he?
- Over there.

789
01:02:58,874 --> 01:03:02,913
Fuck him! Don't worry
about Benny Blanco. Go ahead, it's okay.

790
01:03:04,154 --> 01:03:06,429
What do I do when they tell me that?

791
01:03:10,714 --> 01:03:12,784
You gotta learn to live with it.

792
01:03:12,874 --> 01:03:16,105
Where've you been hiding this man?
This is one sexy man.

793
01:03:16,194 --> 01:03:20,153
- He's an animal. You know that?
- Faster than a speeding bullet.

794
01:03:23,994 --> 01:03:27,623
Yeah, but he got himself
a Mercedes and a yacht, all of that.

795
01:03:28,954 --> 01:03:31,991
Mr. Benny Blanco says it's gonna be okay.

796
01:03:32,714 --> 01:03:35,148
He wants to send
a bottle of champagne over...

797
01:03:35,234 --> 01:03:38,271
...and he wants you to send Steffie over,
when you're ready.

798
01:03:40,474 --> 01:03:44,467
- Carlito, what should I do?
- No problem. Steffie's with Dave now.

799
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,633
But Benny said...

800
01:03:47,394 --> 01:03:48,543
Fuck Benny!

801
01:03:53,234 --> 01:03:55,031
This is from Benny Blanco.

802
01:03:55,114 --> 01:03:56,183
Send it back!

803
01:03:57,154 --> 01:03:58,269
Vete! Vete!

804
01:04:00,194 --> 01:04:02,150
Please, you can't do this.

805
01:04:02,474 --> 01:04:06,353
- Benny spends a lot of money here.
- He's a nickel-bagger. Come on.

806
01:04:06,594 --> 01:04:10,189
What happened to you?
What are you acting like this for?

807
01:04:10,314 --> 01:04:14,592
It doesn't make sense you should hate
this guy. This guy is you 20 years ago.

808
01:04:14,874 --> 01:04:16,068
Never me.

809
01:04:21,394 --> 01:04:24,306
This is the second time
you turned me down for a drink.

810
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:27,352
- You don't like my champagne?
- It could be.

811
01:04:28,874 --> 01:04:31,024
Maybe there's a mis-fucking-understanding.

812
01:04:31,114 --> 01:04:34,311
- Maybe you don't remember me.
- Maybe I don't give a shit.

813
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:38,105
Maybe I don't remember the last time
I blew my nose either.

814
01:04:38,194 --> 01:04:40,833
Who the fuck are you,
I should remember you?

815
01:04:41,314 --> 01:04:43,544
What, you think you're like me?

816
01:04:43,874 --> 01:04:46,786
You ain't like me, motherfucker.
You're a punk.

817
01:04:47,034 --> 01:04:49,992
I've been with made people,
connected people.

818
01:04:50,354 --> 01:04:51,992
Who you been with?

819
01:04:52,914 --> 01:04:56,907
Chain-snatchin', jive-ass,
maricn motherfuckers.

820
01:04:58,114 --> 01:05:01,823
Why don't you get lost? Go ahead,
snatch a purse. Take a fuckin' walk.

821
01:05:01,914 --> 01:05:05,350
The only problem here is that
Steffie doesn't know where she belongs.

822
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:09,586
- Steffie belongs here.
- I think Steffie's makin' a big mistake!

823
01:05:11,754 --> 01:05:13,984
I'll blow your fucking head off.

824
01:05:17,954 --> 01:05:21,390
- I'll blow this cocksucker's head off.
- Put that fuckin' gun away!

825
01:05:21,474 --> 01:05:23,749
- How does it feel?
- Go! Go!

826
01:05:23,834 --> 01:05:25,426
How does it feel?

827
01:05:28,114 --> 01:05:30,582
Get your fuckin' hands off me!

828
01:05:30,874 --> 01:05:32,671
What the fuck is this?

829
01:05:36,314 --> 01:05:38,953
Watch the floor!

830
01:05:39,954 --> 01:05:42,991
We've got a mis-fuckin'-communication
here, man!

831
01:05:45,434 --> 01:05:48,267
Hold it! Stop him here.

832
01:05:49,914 --> 01:05:52,826
Okay, Benny Blanco from the Bronx.

833
01:05:53,314 --> 01:05:55,828
The chick Steffie belongs to the club.

834
01:05:57,234 --> 01:06:01,352
If I ever see you here again...

835
01:06:01,554 --> 01:06:03,431
...you die, just like that.

836
01:06:08,394 --> 01:06:11,943
You're over, man.
You're fuckin' in the history books.

837
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:16,186
So you might as well kill me now, 'cause if
I ever see you again, I'm gonna kill you.

838
01:06:25,634 --> 01:06:28,023
Get him out. Take him out the back.

839
01:06:32,714 --> 01:06:34,193
Take him in the alley.

840
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,713
Dumb move, man. Dumb move.

841
01:06:38,234 --> 01:06:40,828
But it's like them old reflexes comin' back.

842
01:06:42,314 --> 01:06:44,703
I know what's supposed to happen now.

843
01:06:44,794 --> 01:06:46,307
Benny's gotta go down.

844
01:06:47,354 --> 01:06:49,948
And if I don't do it, they're gonna say:

845
01:06:50,154 --> 01:06:53,942
"Carlito, he's flaky, man. Slacked-out.

846
01:06:54,234 --> 01:06:58,227
"A used-to-be bad guy.
Joint got to Carlito."

847
01:06:59,274 --> 01:07:03,904
The street is watchin'.
She is watchin' all the time.

848
01:07:04,154 --> 01:07:05,826
Hold it, hold it!

849
01:07:09,714 --> 01:07:12,831
Let's put him in the trunk of the car
and drive him off the pier.

850
01:07:12,914 --> 01:07:16,384
- Fuck you, man.
- It ain't that far. Down the block.

851
01:07:17,594 --> 01:07:19,869
It'd be like the old days. Be fun.

852
01:07:23,514 --> 01:07:25,391
- Let him go.
- What?

853
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:27,232
Let him go. Get him outta here.

854
01:07:27,314 --> 01:07:30,909
Any other time, that punk would die,
but I can't do that shit no more.

855
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:34,106
Don't want to burn nobody,
even when I know I should.

856
01:07:34,194 --> 01:07:38,790
That ain't me now. All I want
is to get my $75,000 and get out.

857
01:07:39,314 --> 01:07:40,667
Just do it!

858
01:07:42,794 --> 01:07:45,831
Tell me he's in a fuckin' coffin.
What happened?

859
01:07:46,114 --> 01:07:49,948
Somethin' that shouldn't have happened.
Give me your piece, Dave.

860
01:07:50,474 --> 01:07:51,350
What?

861
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:54,187
Give me the fuckin' gun.
Since when are you a tough guy?

862
01:07:55,234 --> 01:07:56,906
Get yourself killed.

863
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:00,626
I can take care of myself.

864
01:08:00,714 --> 01:08:04,389
You think I'm some law school schmuck,
I never saw a bad guy before?

865
01:08:05,874 --> 01:08:09,344
You are gonna wave that thing
at the wrong guy...

866
01:08:09,434 --> 01:08:12,983
...he's gonna take it from you
and bury it up your ass, guaranteed.

867
01:08:13,314 --> 01:08:15,350
Now give me the gun. Come on.

868
01:08:24,234 --> 01:08:26,987
I know you love me, kid,
but you gotta lighten up.

869
01:08:30,434 --> 01:08:31,549
Listen...

870
01:08:32,674 --> 01:08:35,666
...I'm throwin' a big party
out at my summer house Saturday.

871
01:08:35,754 --> 01:08:38,552
I want you to come.
Something I wanna talk to you about.

872
01:08:40,194 --> 01:08:42,469
Why can't you talk to me about it here?

873
01:08:43,314 --> 01:08:45,987
I'll tell you Saturday. I need visual aids.

874
01:09:26,434 --> 01:09:29,267
What's the matter with you,
pushing this guy in the pool...

875
01:09:29,354 --> 01:09:32,471
...your fucking friends knocking down
my rented tables?

876
01:09:58,914 --> 01:10:01,951
What you doing out here by yourself?

877
01:10:03,914 --> 01:10:04,710
Sittin'.

878
01:10:05,554 --> 01:10:07,306
You sure are weird, baby.

879
01:10:07,674 --> 01:10:09,904
How come you never try to fuck me?

880
01:10:09,994 --> 01:10:13,782
You got into a big beef for me,
and you ain't never laid a glove on me.

881
01:10:13,914 --> 01:10:17,748
- You're Dave's girl now.
- He can't fuck me, all the coke he's doin'.

882
01:10:18,874 --> 01:10:21,946
- What are you two talking about?
- Fucking.

883
01:10:22,314 --> 01:10:25,112
Speaking of fucking,
look at those fucking friends of yours.

884
01:10:25,194 --> 01:10:26,832
They're a fucking embarrassment.

885
01:10:26,914 --> 01:10:29,382
- Do something. Be a hostess.
- Fuck you, asshole!

886
01:10:29,554 --> 01:10:30,987
Yeah, fuck me.

887
01:10:31,514 --> 01:10:35,712
Your fuckin' chick's giving you
a hand-job in front of everybody!

888
01:10:35,834 --> 01:10:38,667
I got guests here, for Christ's sake!
People are eating!

889
01:10:38,994 --> 01:10:42,543
- Take it easy, Dave!
- You take it easy! Got any manners?

890
01:10:42,994 --> 01:10:46,782
You wanna fuck her, fuck like a normal
human being! Take her to the bedroom!

891
01:10:49,434 --> 01:10:50,583
People!

892
01:10:52,234 --> 01:10:54,065
Okay, Dave, what's up?

893
01:10:56,514 --> 01:10:59,904
- I need you to do something for me.
- What is it?

894
01:11:06,954 --> 01:11:11,106
You gotta help me spring Tony Taglialucci
from the prison barge at Rikers.

895
01:11:17,074 --> 01:11:18,507
Are you crazy?

896
01:11:19,554 --> 01:11:22,114
He thinks I stole a million dollars from him.

897
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:27,552
This is a dying man. He's nuts.
He's totally fucking paranoid.

898
01:11:31,994 --> 01:11:34,588
Do you realize what you just said to me?

899
01:11:35,554 --> 01:11:39,069
If I don't do it, he's going
to have me killed. It's that simple.

900
01:11:42,554 --> 01:11:45,387
So that means you're gonna
have to bust into prison?

901
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:48,425
What do you think, I'm crazy?

902
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:51,709
He's gonna swim off the island.

903
01:11:52,794 --> 01:11:54,512
- Gonna swim?
- Yeah.

904
01:11:56,074 --> 01:11:57,348
He's gonna drown.

905
01:11:59,874 --> 01:12:02,183
Not if you and I pick him up...

906
01:12:04,074 --> 01:12:05,029
...in that.

907
01:12:06,194 --> 01:12:09,072
Tony's got a guy on the inside
who'll get him in the water.

908
01:12:09,154 --> 01:12:12,066
I know these channels
like the back of my hand.

909
01:12:12,354 --> 01:12:16,029
We cross Little Neck Bay
into the north corner to pick him up.

910
01:12:16,114 --> 01:12:19,345
There's a buoy about 100 yards offshore.
That's where he's gonna be.

911
01:12:19,434 --> 01:12:21,823
This is in and out, half hour tops.

912
01:12:23,194 --> 01:12:25,469
He's gonna jump off a barge...

913
01:12:26,354 --> 01:12:28,185
...swim 100 yards...

914
01:12:29,154 --> 01:12:31,349
...to a buoy in the East River?

915
01:12:31,834 --> 01:12:34,553
Impossible. It's too rough.
He's going to die.

916
01:12:34,634 --> 01:12:37,990
That's his fucking problem.
There's no point in arguing.

917
01:12:38,074 --> 01:12:42,147
I have to do this. I'm asking for your help.

918
01:12:44,874 --> 01:12:48,787
You're a lawyer, man.
What the fuck is happenin' to you?

919
01:12:53,314 --> 01:12:54,793
I don't know.

920
01:12:57,514 --> 01:13:01,632
I am so fucking shook up,
I cannot see straight.

921
01:13:02,594 --> 01:13:05,392
I'm in an impossible fucking situation here.

922
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:10,630
Once I get Tony on the shore...

923
01:13:11,994 --> 01:13:15,703
...there is a distinct possibility
that he and his goombah son...

924
01:13:15,954 --> 01:13:17,945
...have got some plans for me.

925
01:13:19,354 --> 01:13:22,312
What do you mean, "plans"?
What kind of plans?

926
01:13:24,314 --> 01:13:27,829
How do I know he's not gonna kill me?
This guy hates my guts.

927
01:13:31,034 --> 01:13:34,504
I'm in trouble. I am in fuckin' trouble here.

928
01:13:35,074 --> 01:13:37,872
You are the only fucking person on earth...

929
01:13:39,154 --> 01:13:40,712
...that I can trust.

930
01:13:45,274 --> 01:13:47,868
And I'll give you $50,000 to go along.

931
01:13:50,114 --> 01:13:52,708
If I go along, it ain't for the money.

932
01:13:55,634 --> 01:13:56,953
Are you in?

933
01:13:59,754 --> 01:14:00,789
When is this...

934
01:14:00,874 --> 01:14:03,752
I don't know! His son's gonna call me.
Are you in?

935
01:14:10,074 --> 01:14:11,666
All right, I'm in.

936
01:14:15,274 --> 01:14:16,548
Thank you.

937
01:14:43,474 --> 01:14:44,509
Surprise.

938
01:14:47,834 --> 01:14:49,426
I was asleep.

939
01:14:53,634 --> 01:14:57,832
Can I come in?
I bought you some cheesecake.

940
01:14:59,954 --> 01:15:01,831
I don't like cheesecake.

941
01:15:02,554 --> 01:15:06,263
You wouldn't have buzzed me up,
if you wasn't gonna let me in.

942
01:15:08,914 --> 01:15:10,711
I'm saying no, Charlie.

943
01:15:15,994 --> 01:15:17,473
What can I do?

944
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:21,305
What are you gonna do?

945
01:15:24,474 --> 01:15:25,953
Are you gonna...

946
01:15:27,314 --> 01:15:28,827
...bust the chain?

947
01:15:31,634 --> 01:15:33,829
Chase me around the apartment?

948
01:15:38,394 --> 01:15:39,827
Get me naked?

949
01:15:41,754 --> 01:15:43,551
Take me on the floor?

950
01:15:47,634 --> 01:15:50,865
- I'm too old for that.
- That's too bad.

951
01:15:54,674 --> 01:15:56,392
If you can't get in...

952
01:15:58,514 --> 01:16:00,072
...you don't get in.

953
01:17:12,874 --> 01:17:14,751
Where's my cheesecake?

954
01:17:35,154 --> 01:17:37,543
Can I ask you a personal question?

955
01:17:38,714 --> 01:17:39,942
Anything.

956
01:17:44,474 --> 01:17:46,430
Did you ever kill anybody?

957
01:17:51,394 --> 01:17:52,668
I'm sorry.

958
01:17:58,074 --> 01:18:01,623
Well, it's just not a simple question.

959
01:18:02,754 --> 01:18:05,393
- I just can't answer it like...
- That's all right.

960
01:18:05,474 --> 01:18:07,624
- You don't have to...
...there it is.

961
01:18:07,714 --> 01:18:09,625
You don't have to answer.

962
01:18:14,434 --> 01:18:16,664
When I was a kid in East Harlem...

963
01:18:18,674 --> 01:18:20,232
...the wops said...

964
01:18:21,434 --> 01:18:23,948
...no spics could go east of Park Avenue.

965
01:18:25,394 --> 01:18:28,704
Spooks said: "No 'Ricans
west of Fifth Avenue."

966
01:18:29,834 --> 01:18:32,473
That don't leave you
much room to maneuver.

967
01:18:32,554 --> 01:18:36,513
Say you want to go to Central Park, play
with the ducks. You're shit outta luck.

968
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:39,063
So what do you do? You go anyway.

969
01:18:39,634 --> 01:18:42,706
I'm up on 106th Street,
Central Park, near the lake.

970
01:18:43,674 --> 01:18:47,030
I get caught by these Copiens. Right?
They surround me.

971
01:18:47,514 --> 01:18:49,823
So I get my blood up, pull out my blade.

972
01:18:49,914 --> 01:18:52,587
I said: "Come on!
I'll take any one of you mothers!"

973
01:18:52,674 --> 01:18:57,031
They say: "No, man. We're gonna kill
your ass." Out come the zip guns.

974
01:18:58,394 --> 01:18:59,622
Homemade gun.

975
01:19:00,234 --> 01:19:03,988
You pull the hook back,
catch that bullet square, ping.

976
01:19:04,154 --> 01:19:07,271
Hit you in the head, man,
you got serious problems.

977
01:19:07,674 --> 01:19:10,313
That was the last chase on me like that...

978
01:19:10,554 --> 01:19:13,307
...because from then on
I carried my own piece.

979
01:19:14,994 --> 01:19:18,623
Guys went down, yeah, but it ain't like,
you know, you just...

980
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:21,748
...decide one day, and then that's it. No.

981
01:19:23,034 --> 01:19:26,549
You just do what you gotta do to survive.

982
01:19:27,474 --> 01:19:31,706
Somehow, you know,
you just end up where you are.

983
01:19:35,514 --> 01:19:37,903
That's how everybody ends up
where they are.

984
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:39,548
Everybody.

985
01:19:41,554 --> 01:19:44,512
Only I'm gettin' out. I'm gonna rent cars.

986
01:19:47,554 --> 01:19:49,033
What're you laughing at?

987
01:19:49,394 --> 01:19:52,192
Everybody laughs at that. That's a dream.

988
01:19:52,634 --> 01:19:54,226
I know, I'm sorry.

989
01:19:54,394 --> 01:19:56,510
Didn't you ever have a dream?

990
01:19:56,754 --> 01:19:58,267
Of course I did.

991
01:19:59,954 --> 01:20:03,663
The Diamond Room isn't exactly
the end of my rainbow, you know.

992
01:20:03,874 --> 01:20:05,023
It's just...

993
01:20:07,114 --> 01:20:08,069
I don't know.

994
01:20:14,034 --> 01:20:16,389
Just sometimes I hear myself talk...

995
01:20:19,834 --> 01:20:25,227
...about new agents and auditions,
and I'm trying to be so optimistic.

996
01:20:29,914 --> 01:20:31,313
Then I think...

997
01:20:32,234 --> 01:20:34,429
...why should I be so optimistic?

998
01:20:45,954 --> 01:20:47,626
Yeah, I had a dream...

999
01:20:50,274 --> 01:20:51,866
...but now I'm awake...

1000
01:20:55,154 --> 01:20:56,826
...and I hate my dream.

1001
01:21:07,274 --> 01:21:10,710
Maybe it's time I started thinking
about doing something else.

1002
01:21:14,714 --> 01:21:16,625
Maybe someplace else too.

1003
01:21:24,714 --> 01:21:28,548
Seems like every day I'm finding
something new I like about Gail.

1004
01:21:28,914 --> 01:21:31,906
I keep workin' my points
about us gettin' out of New York...

1005
01:21:31,994 --> 01:21:35,111
...going to live in the Bahamas together,
permanent.

1006
01:21:35,434 --> 01:21:37,231
She ain't sayin' much, but...

1007
01:21:38,274 --> 01:21:40,788
...I can tell the idea is growin' on her.

1008
01:21:42,594 --> 01:21:47,065
Money's comin' in steady now. It won't
be much longer till I got what I need.

1009
01:21:48,274 --> 01:21:51,346
This dream of mine, it's so close...

1010
01:21:52,034 --> 01:21:53,513
...I can touch it.

1011
01:21:56,794 --> 01:21:59,866
- Where you going? Wait, no.
- I'm tired.

1012
01:22:00,274 --> 01:22:03,186
- I'm an old man. I need a rockin' chair.
- Come on! Please!

1013
01:22:03,274 --> 01:22:06,266
Let me watch you.
I love to watch you. Go ahead.

1014
01:22:06,674 --> 01:22:07,948
There it is.

1015
01:22:12,554 --> 01:22:13,748
I'm sorry!

1016
01:22:16,074 --> 01:22:17,507
Look at that!

1017
01:22:21,114 --> 01:22:23,389
Here's a bunch of us at the Copa.

1018
01:22:23,874 --> 01:22:26,513
Everybody dancin', drinkin' Dom Perignon.

1019
01:22:28,034 --> 01:22:30,070
Everything paid for by Kleinfeld.

1020
01:22:31,234 --> 01:22:33,953
Won't even let you
put your hand in your pocket.

1021
01:22:34,034 --> 01:22:36,389
Always sneakin' off, payin' the waiter.

1022
01:22:37,634 --> 01:22:40,785
But he has that bad drinker face.

1023
01:22:42,034 --> 01:22:44,832
His eyes are gettin' beadier
and beadier these days.

1024
01:22:45,634 --> 01:22:47,352
Should have seen it coming.

1025
01:22:47,434 --> 01:22:49,948
Don't stop. Please don't stop.
Look at that move.

1026
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:03,708
You're gonna let this fuckin' goombah
paw your woman like that?

1027
01:23:04,674 --> 01:23:06,312
They're just dancin'.

1028
01:23:07,594 --> 01:23:10,392
Don't you appreciate that,
the movement, the rhythm?

1029
01:23:10,474 --> 01:23:13,750
What I don't appreciate,
he's got his fucking hands all over her ass.

1030
01:23:14,674 --> 01:23:16,869
He don't have his hands over her ass.

1031
01:23:17,074 --> 01:23:19,144
I believe those are her hips.

1032
01:23:21,394 --> 01:23:22,827
Look at the shithead.

1033
01:23:23,634 --> 01:23:25,989
These wise guys think
they're so hard-assed.

1034
01:23:26,194 --> 01:23:29,186
I am so sick of hoods like that...

1035
01:23:29,994 --> 01:23:32,303
...coming into my office, my office...

1036
01:23:33,154 --> 01:23:35,429
...thinkin' they can push me around.

1037
01:23:38,434 --> 01:23:42,313
You should tell him what you think.
Why hold somethin' like that inside?

1038
01:23:43,554 --> 01:23:45,704
Why not get something like that
off your chest?

1039
01:23:45,794 --> 01:23:48,183
- It's a terrible thing to carry around.
- I will.

1040
01:23:48,274 --> 01:23:50,105
- I think you should.
- I will.

1041
01:23:50,714 --> 01:23:53,945
See how interested
he's gonna be in your comments.

1042
01:23:59,074 --> 01:24:00,189
What're you doin'?

1043
01:24:00,274 --> 01:24:02,390
- Are you outta your mind?
- What's that?

1044
01:24:02,474 --> 01:24:05,944
- Yeah, you, wop.
- Me?

1045
01:24:06,154 --> 01:24:08,384
- You, spaghetti-dick.
- Wait. Okay, okay.

1046
01:24:08,554 --> 01:24:11,273
- I'm talking to you. Yeah, you.
- You're talkin' to me?

1047
01:24:11,354 --> 01:24:14,312
- Just ignore him. He's drunk.
- What'd he say?

1048
01:24:15,594 --> 01:24:16,822
Sit down!

1049
01:24:18,754 --> 01:24:20,870
- Who does he think he is?
- No problem.

1050
01:24:20,954 --> 01:24:24,185
Come on. Let's have a drink.
Come on, everybody.

1051
01:24:24,674 --> 01:24:27,871
- Can you believe this loser?
- Let's go back to the table.

1052
01:24:28,114 --> 01:24:30,867
- People have no sense of humor.
- Let's go.

1053
01:24:31,274 --> 01:24:34,664
I was just fooling around.
I'd never let anything happen.

1054
01:24:34,754 --> 01:24:38,064
Carlito and me, we take care of each other.
He knows. Right, kid?

1055
01:24:38,154 --> 01:24:39,303
Come on.

1056
01:24:40,874 --> 01:24:42,785
You're a beautiful woman.

1057
01:24:45,034 --> 01:24:47,912
You don't get seasick on boats, do you?

1058
01:24:51,114 --> 01:24:52,866
- No, I don't.
- Good.

1059
01:24:54,554 --> 01:24:57,387
Just asking 'cause of our little boat trip
tomorrow night.

1060
01:24:57,474 --> 01:24:58,589
Just drop it.

1061
01:24:58,674 --> 01:25:02,508
Just tryin' to cover all the bases.
It's comin' up, you know.

1062
01:25:07,034 --> 01:25:08,945
You two going somewhere?

1063
01:25:10,554 --> 01:25:12,465
No big deal. Just a little boat ride.

1064
01:25:12,554 --> 01:25:15,944
Why don't you just let it go?
It's dull what you're doin'.

1065
01:25:16,034 --> 01:25:18,229
- What's the problem?
- It's just fuckin' dull.

1066
01:25:18,314 --> 01:25:21,545
I'm just askin' a simple question.
What's the matter?

1067
01:25:21,674 --> 01:25:23,312
You're actin' like an asshole.

1068
01:25:23,394 --> 01:25:27,785
If a guy's goin' on a boat, you wanna know
if he gets seasick. It could be important.

1069
01:25:27,874 --> 01:25:29,193
What boat?

1070
01:25:32,394 --> 01:25:34,703
What boat are you talking about?

1071
01:25:41,154 --> 01:25:42,872
What boat, Charlie?

1072
01:25:57,114 --> 01:26:01,505
If you ever talk that shit again
in front of her, I'm gonna kill you.

1073
01:26:07,114 --> 01:26:08,672
What's the matter with him?

1074
01:26:11,714 --> 01:26:13,306
I don't like him.

1075
01:26:13,874 --> 01:26:17,708
- Didn't like him the minute I met him.
- You're just not listenin' to me.

1076
01:26:20,314 --> 01:26:21,588
All right.

1077
01:26:22,794 --> 01:26:25,103
So what is this boat thing then?

1078
01:26:26,194 --> 01:26:29,186
What is that asshole
manipulating you into? Tell me.

1079
01:26:29,274 --> 01:26:32,505
Just helpin' him out with something,
that's all. I owe him.

1080
01:26:32,594 --> 01:26:33,993
You owe him?

1081
01:26:35,154 --> 01:26:37,031
He's a fucking cokehead!

1082
01:26:38,274 --> 01:26:40,913
I can't believe you hang around
with that guy.

1083
01:26:42,154 --> 01:26:43,109
He's sick.

1084
01:26:43,754 --> 01:26:46,427
He's gonna get you killed,
or sent back to prison.

1085
01:26:46,514 --> 01:26:48,186
He saved my life!

1086
01:26:49,834 --> 01:26:52,268
So now you have to pay him with it?

1087
01:26:54,194 --> 01:26:57,425
Jesus Christ, Charlie,
you give me this whole song and dance...

1088
01:26:57,514 --> 01:27:00,586
...about how you're out of that shit,
but you're not.

1089
01:27:00,794 --> 01:27:03,513
Song and dance? What does that mean,
"song and dance"?

1090
01:27:04,154 --> 01:27:05,473
You're not.

1091
01:27:06,234 --> 01:27:08,509
Where'd you get that? From what?

1092
01:27:10,954 --> 01:27:14,230
- Why'd you drag me into this?
- Drag you into what?

1093
01:27:14,434 --> 01:27:17,744
Why'd you make me believe all the crap
about Bahamas and paradise?

1094
01:27:19,914 --> 01:27:21,506
I feel ridiculous!

1095
01:27:22,794 --> 01:27:24,512
'Cause you haven't changed!

1096
01:27:25,154 --> 01:27:26,985
You haven't changed a bit!

1097
01:27:31,994 --> 01:27:34,554
What the fuck are you tryin' to tell me?

1098
01:27:34,674 --> 01:27:38,713
That my gettin' out is just some bullshit
fantasy trip I'm layin' on you?

1099
01:27:38,914 --> 01:27:41,474
Is that what you're sayin'?
How could you say that?

1100
01:27:41,554 --> 01:27:44,671
How can you say that
when you know how close I am?

1101
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:48,108
How could you say those words to me?

1102
01:27:49,274 --> 01:27:52,550
I gotta do this, just this one thing,
and then I'm out.

1103
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:55,148
- I owe Dave.
- You don't owe him shit!

1104
01:27:55,634 --> 01:27:57,704
You think you do. That's the problem.

1105
01:27:57,794 --> 01:28:01,025
- That's why nobody like you gets out.
- You're not listening.

1106
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:04,670
Everything you learned
in the neighborhood...

1107
01:28:04,754 --> 01:28:06,824
...won't do anything but get you killed!

1108
01:28:07,314 --> 01:28:10,226
How do you know what I learned
in my neighborhood?

1109
01:28:10,714 --> 01:28:12,466
This is stupid what you say.

1110
01:28:12,674 --> 01:28:14,710
I know how this dream ends.

1111
01:28:16,314 --> 01:28:18,066
It isn't in paradise.

1112
01:28:19,834 --> 01:28:24,271
It ends with me carrying you
into Sutton Emergency Room...

1113
01:28:25,114 --> 01:28:26,945
...at 3:00 a.m.

1114
01:28:29,474 --> 01:28:31,192
And standing there...

1115
01:28:32,154 --> 01:28:33,872
...crying like an idiot...

1116
01:28:36,354 --> 01:28:39,187
...while your shoes fill with blood
and you die.

1117
01:28:39,274 --> 01:28:43,790
- You won't listen to me...
- 'Cause you're bullshitting me!

1118
01:28:44,194 --> 01:28:46,628
You're not listening to me!

1119
01:28:59,154 --> 01:29:01,190
Dave is my friend.

1120
01:29:03,394 --> 01:29:04,668
I owe him.

1121
01:29:05,994 --> 01:29:06,983
That's...

1122
01:29:08,474 --> 01:29:09,623
...who I am.

1123
01:29:11,034 --> 01:29:13,389
That's what I am, right or wrong.

1124
01:29:15,994 --> 01:29:17,712
I can't change that!

1125
01:29:29,874 --> 01:29:31,910
Whatever he wants you to do...

1126
01:29:34,434 --> 01:29:35,787
...don't do it.

1127
01:29:37,394 --> 01:29:39,430
For me, please, don't do it.

1128
01:29:41,394 --> 01:29:42,543
Please.

1129
01:29:43,274 --> 01:29:45,663
Just don't do it.

1130
01:29:51,394 --> 01:29:54,113
That's the last time I wipe up your blood!

1131
01:29:58,194 --> 01:30:01,391
Came the big night,
and right away I didn't like it.

1132
01:30:01,714 --> 01:30:04,103
Kleinfeld was coked out of his mind...

1133
01:30:04,914 --> 01:30:07,633
...the flaps of his nose, all red and swollen.

1134
01:30:08,434 --> 01:30:09,947
Bad start, Jack.

1135
01:30:13,154 --> 01:30:16,942
- What's with the extra guy?
- This is one of Tony's sons, Frankie.

1136
01:30:17,034 --> 01:30:18,387
- It's Frank.
- Whatever.

1137
01:30:18,474 --> 01:30:21,705
- What is with the extra guy?
- Excuse me, is this your boat?

1138
01:30:21,994 --> 01:30:24,952
Then shut the fuck up.
I thought I needed help, I brought help.

1139
01:30:25,034 --> 01:30:27,389
We'll take the La Guardia side
through the Sound.

1140
01:30:27,474 --> 01:30:31,387
Take the wheel when we pick up Tony.
Carlito, you help me fish him out.

1141
01:30:31,474 --> 01:30:33,988
- It's Frank.
- Whatever. Cast her off.

1142
01:30:35,114 --> 01:30:38,424
- What's that?
- Untie the fuckin' rope, spic! Come on!

1143
01:30:53,594 --> 01:30:55,630
This guy a friend of yours?

1144
01:30:57,314 --> 01:30:59,111
Yeah, he's a friend of mine.

1145
01:30:59,194 --> 01:31:01,105
He's a fucking cockroach.

1146
01:31:19,794 --> 01:31:21,944
All right now, take it easy.

1147
01:31:22,674 --> 01:31:23,868
I see the buoy.

1148
01:31:24,514 --> 01:31:26,391
You see it? Where?

1149
01:31:29,154 --> 01:31:31,543
Slow. I can't see a fuckin' thing.

1150
01:31:31,994 --> 01:31:34,906
- It's right there.
- Did you hear what I just said?

1151
01:31:34,994 --> 01:31:37,462
Would you slow down?
You're gonna run him over.

1152
01:31:40,954 --> 01:31:42,512
Where you goin'?

1153
01:31:43,954 --> 01:31:46,593
Jesus, fuck, you passed him! You idiot!

1154
01:31:47,074 --> 01:31:49,986
Frankie boy, hold on.
You come up on the fly deck with me.

1155
01:31:50,154 --> 01:31:51,951
We can't back it up from down here.

1156
01:31:52,034 --> 01:31:53,308
Up here! Come on!

1157
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:55,710
Come on, follow me. This way.

1158
01:31:59,554 --> 01:32:00,509
Help!

1159
01:32:01,434 --> 01:32:03,948
Come here! Come back!

1160
01:32:06,154 --> 01:32:09,544
Get outta the fuckin' way!
I can't see a goddamn thing.

1161
01:32:15,594 --> 01:32:16,913
Over here!

1162
01:32:19,274 --> 01:32:21,265
You missed me! Over here!

1163
01:32:32,074 --> 01:32:34,269
You see that light right there?

1164
01:32:35,194 --> 01:32:36,513
Yeah, the light.

1165
01:32:36,594 --> 01:32:39,233
Just keep the bow pointed
straight at that light.

1166
01:32:39,314 --> 01:32:41,908
- Can you manage that?
- I got the light.

1167
01:32:45,914 --> 01:32:47,029
Here!

1168
01:32:47,754 --> 01:32:49,551
- Come on.
- Over here.

1169
01:32:51,314 --> 01:32:52,269
Help!

1170
01:32:54,954 --> 01:32:57,070
Okay, got him! Stop it!

1171
01:32:57,394 --> 01:32:59,112
I got him! Stop it!

1172
01:33:00,554 --> 01:33:02,272
- Hurry up!
- Okay, come on.

1173
01:33:04,554 --> 01:33:05,304
Help me!

1174
01:33:05,394 --> 01:33:07,385
- You got him?
- I got him.

1175
01:33:07,834 --> 01:33:11,952
Take the wheel. We're starting to turn.
I got him. Tony, grab a rail!

1176
01:33:14,434 --> 01:33:15,628
Help me!

1177
01:33:17,514 --> 01:33:18,708
Help me.

1178
01:33:21,114 --> 01:33:23,264
You tell me how it feels...

1179
01:33:23,354 --> 01:33:27,108
...with the fuckin' eels
and the fuckin' crabs...

1180
01:33:27,274 --> 01:33:29,788
...comin' outta your fuckin' eyes!

1181
01:33:32,114 --> 01:33:34,025
What the fuck you doin'?

1182
01:33:37,954 --> 01:33:41,310
- Now, drown, you guinea bastard!
- Get the fuck off!

1183
01:33:42,114 --> 01:33:43,513
Help me get Frankie.

1184
01:33:44,034 --> 01:33:46,468
You killed us, Dave. You killed us.

1185
01:33:48,514 --> 01:33:49,663
My God.

1186
01:33:57,954 --> 01:33:59,512
Come on, Frankie.

1187
01:34:01,434 --> 01:34:03,823
Your daddy's waitin' for ya.

1188
01:34:06,354 --> 01:34:07,389
Come on!

1189
01:34:07,834 --> 01:34:10,826
Take an end, for Christ's sake.
We're fallin' out of position.

1190
01:34:11,474 --> 01:34:14,272
We're gonna stand you up
and say good night.

1191
01:34:18,474 --> 01:34:19,907
Get him on the other side.

1192
01:34:20,074 --> 01:34:23,589
One, two, three.

1193
01:34:39,194 --> 01:34:42,584
There's a line you cross
you don't never come back from.

1194
01:34:44,274 --> 01:34:45,912
Point of no return.

1195
01:34:46,994 --> 01:34:50,703
Dave crossed it. I'm here with him.

1196
01:34:51,474 --> 01:34:54,864
That means I'm goin' along for the ride,
the whole ride...

1197
01:34:55,194 --> 01:34:58,470
...all the way to the end of the line,
wherever that is.

1198
01:35:02,474 --> 01:35:05,307
I had to do it.
He never would've let me live.

1199
01:35:06,634 --> 01:35:09,546
I know, you're pissed.
I'm gonna throw in another $10,000.

1200
01:35:09,634 --> 01:35:13,309
I'm gonna send over the whole $60,000
in cash tomorrow. All right?

1201
01:35:13,994 --> 01:35:18,272
It's gonna look like the kid tried to spring
the old man, boat flipped, they drowned.

1202
01:35:18,354 --> 01:35:22,666
Maybe they got their heads split
by a scow or barge just for good measure.

1203
01:35:22,794 --> 01:35:25,388
This is never gonna come back to us.
Trust me.

1204
01:35:25,594 --> 01:35:27,824
- You ripped him off, didn't you?
- Who?

1205
01:35:28,234 --> 01:35:31,510
Tony T. You did take the million dollars,
didn't you?

1206
01:35:37,234 --> 01:35:38,303
Yeah.

1207
01:35:43,514 --> 01:35:46,904
You ain't a lawyer no more, Dave.
You're a gangster now.

1208
01:35:47,754 --> 01:35:50,826
You're on the other side.
Whole new ball game.

1209
01:35:52,514 --> 01:35:57,269
You can't learn about it in school,
and you can't have a late start.

1210
01:35:58,634 --> 01:36:00,352
Don't worry about me.

1211
01:36:00,914 --> 01:36:02,393
One more thing.

1212
01:36:03,994 --> 01:36:05,268
We're even.

1213
01:36:07,154 --> 01:36:08,667
- Let's get a drink.
- Say it!

1214
01:36:11,674 --> 01:36:12,993
We're even.

1215
01:36:15,914 --> 01:36:17,188
We're even.

1216
01:36:24,834 --> 01:36:27,109
We ain't never gonna sell these tickets...

1217
01:36:27,954 --> 01:36:29,990
...whackin' a boss and his kid.

1218
01:36:32,594 --> 01:36:35,427
These Italians, I work with 'em, I know 'em.

1219
01:36:36,074 --> 01:36:38,986
They will read this one
with their eyes closed.

1220
01:36:40,234 --> 01:36:41,906
I gotta keep movin'.

1221
01:37:23,474 --> 01:37:24,907
Most people will.

1222
01:37:31,314 --> 01:37:32,542
You get old enough...

1223
01:37:32,634 --> 01:37:35,785
...you remember a reason
why everybody wants to whack you.

1224
01:37:36,034 --> 01:37:37,706
You believe 'em all...

1225
01:37:39,194 --> 01:37:41,788
...but you know somebody's gotta be lyin'.

1226
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:45,424
Or maybe they're all lyin'.

1227
01:37:47,354 --> 01:37:51,666
When you can't see the angles no more,
you're in trouble, baby.

1228
01:37:52,834 --> 01:37:53,983
You're in trouble.

1229
01:37:59,314 --> 01:38:01,987
There's a Patrolman Williams on the line.

1230
01:38:03,594 --> 01:38:04,913
Put him on.

1231
01:38:06,474 --> 01:38:10,786
Mr. Kleinfeld? This is Patrolman Williams.
We're down here at your garage.

1232
01:38:11,594 --> 01:38:14,108
Your license plate is DK 777?

1233
01:38:14,434 --> 01:38:16,152
Yeah. Is there a problem?

1234
01:38:16,234 --> 01:38:19,863
Somebody tried to steal your Mercedes.
There was an accident.

1235
01:38:20,154 --> 01:38:22,031
- There was an accident?
- Yeah.

1236
01:38:22,114 --> 01:38:24,708
- Is it badly damaged?
- I'm afraid so.

1237
01:38:24,794 --> 01:38:26,546
I'll be right down.

1238
01:38:35,514 --> 01:38:37,550
I'll be ten minutes. Come on.

1239
01:39:50,914 --> 01:39:53,428
Mr. Taglialucci says to hold that for him!

1240
01:40:08,354 --> 01:40:09,503
Wait up.

1241
01:40:10,274 --> 01:40:12,788
I can't talk. I have an appointment.

1242
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:17,633
You were right about Kleinfeld.
He's a bad guy.

1243
01:40:18,234 --> 01:40:21,988
- Me and him are finished.
- I can't talk. I'll call you, okay?

1244
01:40:22,074 --> 01:40:23,905
Slow down. What is it?

1245
01:40:24,794 --> 01:40:27,388
- Am I on the outs with you? Is that it?
- Yeah.

1246
01:40:27,474 --> 01:40:29,669
That's crazy. What's wrong with you?

1247
01:40:29,754 --> 01:40:32,427
I have a lot on my mind.
Can we please talk later?

1248
01:40:32,554 --> 01:40:36,024
I just wanted you to know
you were right about Kleinfeld.

1249
01:40:36,554 --> 01:40:39,193
- I'm sorry if you're upset.
- I gotta go.

1250
01:40:39,314 --> 01:40:40,872
I have a doctor's appointment.

1251
01:40:40,954 --> 01:40:43,832
- What's the matter? You sick?
- No, I'm late.

1252
01:40:44,474 --> 01:40:49,150
- We'll take a cab. What's wrong?
- No, Charlie, I'm late! I'm late!

1253
01:40:51,994 --> 01:40:54,508
- You mean you...
- Not for long, okay?

1254
01:40:56,394 --> 01:40:57,827
What does that mean?

1255
01:40:57,914 --> 01:41:00,667
I'm not gonna have a kid
who's not gonna have a father.

1256
01:41:01,474 --> 01:41:03,385
We gotta talk about this.

1257
01:41:05,354 --> 01:41:07,948
- Mr. Brigante, my name is Duncan.
- Oh, my God.

1258
01:41:08,034 --> 01:41:11,743
I'm here to escort you to Mr. Norwalk
in the District Attorney's office.

1259
01:41:12,154 --> 01:41:15,226
I got nothin' to say to him
unless I'm under arrest.

1260
01:41:15,314 --> 01:41:18,545
Mr. Norwalk has a tape
he'd like to play for you.

1261
01:41:19,514 --> 01:41:23,951
Unless I'm under arrest, I ain't goin'
anywhere, especially without my lawyer.

1262
01:41:24,874 --> 01:41:28,503
Mr. Kleinfeld took a knife in the chest
at 2:00 this afternoon.

1263
01:41:31,514 --> 01:41:33,630
I advise you to come with us.

1264
01:41:34,434 --> 01:41:36,948
We may be the only friends you've got.

1265
01:41:38,874 --> 01:41:40,307
I'm going, too.

1266
01:41:41,474 --> 01:41:43,510
Kleinfeld's lucky to be alive.

1267
01:41:44,354 --> 01:41:46,345
We're holding him at East Side Hospital.

1268
01:41:46,434 --> 01:41:49,232
We want his ass healthy
when we send it upstate.

1269
01:41:49,754 --> 01:41:52,507
You're sendin' him upstate? What for?

1270
01:41:54,314 --> 01:41:57,863
David Kleinfeld became a very big fish
while you were gone.

1271
01:41:59,274 --> 01:42:01,151
Even bigger than you. He's dirty.

1272
01:42:01,234 --> 01:42:05,671
Money laundering, jury tampering, bribery.
We've been after him for some time now.

1273
01:42:06,714 --> 01:42:09,182
I don't know nothin' about that, so...

1274
01:42:10,514 --> 01:42:12,630
There's a lot you don't know.

1275
01:42:14,834 --> 01:42:17,667
Bill, you got no case here.
You know it and I know it.

1276
01:42:17,754 --> 01:42:19,870
Chances are, you won't even
get an indictment.

1277
01:42:19,954 --> 01:42:21,672
Wanna try your luck?

1278
01:42:22,394 --> 01:42:26,626
Look, let's not both waste our time.
You said maybe I could help myself.

1279
01:42:26,994 --> 01:42:30,509
- You're not taping this, are you?
- Gimme a little credit.

1280
01:42:30,594 --> 01:42:33,631
All right. I thought of something
you might want.

1281
01:42:34,554 --> 01:42:37,830
You get off me, I'll help you put
Carlito Brigante back inside.

1282
01:42:37,914 --> 01:42:39,711
Brigante? For what?

1283
01:42:40,954 --> 01:42:45,584
After he got out, he started coming to
my office and making a lot of phone calls.

1284
01:42:45,714 --> 01:42:50,344
I found out he was back with Rolando
Rivas, his old partner, dealin' coke.

1285
01:42:51,394 --> 01:42:53,191
And I'm talkin' serious numbers.

1286
01:42:53,874 --> 01:42:55,705
Would you testify to that?

1287
01:42:56,754 --> 01:42:58,028
Absolutely.

1288
01:43:02,874 --> 01:43:04,307
We don't believe him.

1289
01:43:07,514 --> 01:43:12,144
Word on the street is you've been clean
since you came out of prison.

1290
01:43:13,234 --> 01:43:15,190
Kleinfeld's the one we're after.

1291
01:43:15,834 --> 01:43:19,668
He was right. I'd never get
an indictment with what I had.

1292
01:43:20,274 --> 01:43:22,185
But now, with your help...

1293
01:43:23,154 --> 01:43:25,952
...we can put this filth away
for a long time.

1294
01:43:30,154 --> 01:43:31,109
Hermano...

1295
01:43:32,914 --> 01:43:34,870
...we know about Tony T.

1296
01:43:35,594 --> 01:43:37,027
Who's Tony T.?

1297
01:43:37,554 --> 01:43:38,907
Yeah, right.

1298
01:43:39,714 --> 01:43:43,992
His body popped up in the East River
yesterday, and his kid, Frankie's.

1299
01:43:44,954 --> 01:43:47,832
Somebody was trying
to bust Tony outta prison.

1300
01:43:48,474 --> 01:43:52,023
I don't know these people you mentioned.
I don't know them.

1301
01:43:53,554 --> 01:43:56,751
Tony T. had another son
besides Frankie, Vincent.

1302
01:43:57,674 --> 01:44:00,347
Seems Vincent went crazy
after those bodies popped up.

1303
01:44:00,594 --> 01:44:04,030
Let it out all over the street
that Kleinfeld set up that prison break...

1304
01:44:04,114 --> 01:44:06,309
...then killed his father and his brother.

1305
01:44:07,034 --> 01:44:09,264
We aren't saying you were
on that boat too.

1306
01:44:10,274 --> 01:44:14,153
But knowing your relationship
with Kleinfeld, that's a good possibility.

1307
01:44:14,234 --> 01:44:16,190
Don't you think, hermano?

1308
01:44:17,234 --> 01:44:18,872
I don't like boats.

1309
01:44:21,674 --> 01:44:23,551
All right, here's the deal.

1310
01:44:23,794 --> 01:44:26,786
If you were on that boat,
and I know goddamn well you were...

1311
01:44:27,314 --> 01:44:30,386
...testify against Kleinfeld
for first-degree murder.

1312
01:44:32,354 --> 01:44:36,029
You'll receive complete immunity and
a couple airline tickets to the Bahamas.

1313
01:44:36,114 --> 01:44:39,504
You wanna get even with Kleinfeld?
Here it is on a silver platter.

1314
01:44:40,314 --> 01:44:44,307
I would love to help you, but I can't.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1315
01:44:44,394 --> 01:44:47,431
I don't know these people.
I don't know what you're sayin'...

1316
01:44:47,714 --> 01:44:51,024
Let me tell you somethin',
Mr. Convicted Dope Peddler...

1317
01:44:51,114 --> 01:44:54,868
...if we can guess you were on that boat,
how long before the Italians do, too?

1318
01:44:54,954 --> 01:44:57,627
What if they get to Kleinfeld?
They can twist his arm.

1319
01:44:57,754 --> 01:44:59,949
You think he won't give you up?
Think again!

1320
01:45:00,074 --> 01:45:02,747
You don't owe Kleinfeld nothing.

1321
01:45:03,074 --> 01:45:06,544
The shyster tried to set you up.
Bury you, Jack.

1322
01:45:12,154 --> 01:45:13,348
That it?

1323
01:45:19,074 --> 01:45:21,383
I wanna hear from you by noon tomorrow.

1324
01:45:21,554 --> 01:45:25,024
You think you're gonna sail off
into the sunset, asshole?

1325
01:45:25,714 --> 01:45:27,067
Think again.

1326
01:45:32,354 --> 01:45:36,347
You gotta do it.
They're giving you no choice.

1327
01:45:37,234 --> 01:45:39,031
You want out, go ahead.

1328
01:45:39,194 --> 01:45:41,947
You can turn around,
walk away, never look back.

1329
01:45:42,034 --> 01:45:44,628
I would understand. But I got a plan.

1330
01:45:45,194 --> 01:45:48,106
I got a way outta this.
Pull over here, please.

1331
01:45:48,434 --> 01:45:51,267
- What's going on?
- Just wait five minutes.

1332
01:45:53,514 --> 01:45:56,551
- Where are you going?
- Wait here five minutes.

1333
01:46:48,914 --> 01:46:50,347
What is that?

1334
01:46:50,554 --> 01:46:53,591
Tickets on an overnight train to Miami.

1335
01:46:54,874 --> 01:46:56,944
Nobody's gonna look for us on the train.

1336
01:46:57,034 --> 01:47:00,071
We hit Miami, we catch a plane to Nassau.

1337
01:47:01,674 --> 01:47:04,142
- What about the club? Your money?
- Fuck the club.

1338
01:47:04,234 --> 01:47:08,944
I already got $70,000 in a safe. My friend
in the islands can float us the rest.

1339
01:47:09,594 --> 01:47:12,904
Let's do it. Let's get outta here.

1340
01:47:13,834 --> 01:47:15,347
All three of us.

1341
01:47:18,154 --> 01:47:19,906
We're runnin' out of time, babe.

1342
01:47:20,154 --> 01:47:24,147
The dream don't come no closer by itself.
We gotta run after it now.

1343
01:47:27,834 --> 01:47:31,713
I know, it's not the way I planned it either,
but it is how it is.

1344
01:47:32,514 --> 01:47:36,871
I'm gonna go to the club, get my money,
and I'm goin' straight to Grand Central.

1345
01:47:36,954 --> 01:47:40,867
Train leaves 11:30 for Miami.
You're gonna be there, Gail?

1346
01:47:42,274 --> 01:47:44,105
- You'll be there?
- I'll be there.

1347
01:47:44,194 --> 01:47:46,025
I love you.

1348
01:47:49,354 --> 01:47:52,187
- Just make sure you're there.
- I'll see you later.

1349
01:47:55,794 --> 01:47:59,548
Train leaves in five hours,
and I'm angling like crazy in my head.

1350
01:48:00,034 --> 01:48:05,062
Norwalk'll blow over. He won't come out
of the country if he can't bust me here.

1351
01:48:05,714 --> 01:48:07,830
But he ain't my only problem.

1352
01:48:08,274 --> 01:48:10,993
Five hours left. Can I think of everything?

1353
01:48:11,114 --> 01:48:13,833
Cover everybody. Tie all the shoelaces.

1354
01:48:16,114 --> 01:48:17,911
Gotta listen to my instincts...

1355
01:48:17,994 --> 01:48:21,589
...like the one tellin' me that face
and that uniform don't go together.

1356
01:48:24,714 --> 01:48:28,468
Just one last piece of business.
Gotta look in Kleinfeld's eyes.

1357
01:48:28,954 --> 01:48:30,626
Gotta know for sure.

1358
01:48:38,994 --> 01:48:40,222
Who are you?

1359
01:48:40,354 --> 01:48:43,391
- Kleinfeld is my lawyer.
- Hands on the wall.

1360
01:48:49,594 --> 01:48:50,788
Go ahead.

1361
01:48:57,794 --> 01:48:58,749
Relax.

1362
01:49:00,274 --> 01:49:01,707
It's your pal.

1363
01:49:03,234 --> 01:49:05,190
Scared the hell out of me.

1364
01:49:06,234 --> 01:49:10,022
Cop's not supposed to let anybody in.
It's you, it's okay, but...

1365
01:49:10,354 --> 01:49:12,470
Cops ain't gonna protect you.

1366
01:49:13,634 --> 01:49:15,386
The mob is looking for you.

1367
01:49:16,354 --> 01:49:18,743
I know. Where the fuck have you been?

1368
01:49:18,834 --> 01:49:20,313
What do you got here?

1369
01:49:24,514 --> 01:49:26,505
- Where you been?
- How do you feel?

1370
01:49:26,594 --> 01:49:29,904
I'm not feeling very well.
Where the fuck have you been?

1371
01:49:35,394 --> 01:49:37,305
I've been to Norwalk's office.

1372
01:49:38,514 --> 01:49:39,788
I heard the tape.

1373
01:49:41,994 --> 01:49:43,188
That pig.

1374
01:49:44,514 --> 01:49:47,267
Never give up your friends,
no matter what.

1375
01:49:48,914 --> 01:49:51,872
They doctor these things,
play 'em outta context.

1376
01:49:52,154 --> 01:49:53,826
I can't believe you are such a...

1377
01:49:54,114 --> 01:49:56,105
Don't fuckin' do that! Fuck you!

1378
01:49:57,594 --> 01:49:59,664
What the fuck are you doing?

1379
01:50:00,794 --> 01:50:03,467
Would you fuckin' put that away?
It's loaded!

1380
01:50:07,554 --> 01:50:11,706
Fuck you and your self-righteous code
of the goddamned street.

1381
01:50:13,154 --> 01:50:17,386
Did it pull you out of a thirty-year stint
in five years? Did it? No, I did.

1382
01:50:18,594 --> 01:50:21,870
Did it get you acquitted four fucking times?
No, it didn't. I did.

1383
01:50:21,954 --> 01:50:25,151
So fuck you, fuck the street.
Your whole goddamn world's this big...

1384
01:50:25,234 --> 01:50:28,146
...and there's only one rule:
you save your own ass.

1385
01:50:33,914 --> 01:50:35,472
Save your own ass.

1386
01:50:36,754 --> 01:50:40,872
- Save your own ass.
- See this? It belongs here.

1387
01:50:41,474 --> 01:50:44,864
Not behind a pillow.
This way you can reach for it quick.

1388
01:50:45,674 --> 01:50:47,904
They come in, you ready for 'em.

1389
01:50:49,994 --> 01:50:53,304
So long. You got a beautiful future.

1390
01:51:30,234 --> 01:51:31,667
Quittin' time.

1391
01:51:31,794 --> 01:51:34,752
- You're early.
- A few minutes. Finish your paper?

1392
01:51:34,834 --> 01:51:36,790
- It's all yours.
- Thanks.

1393
01:51:38,114 --> 01:51:39,308
Be good.

1394
01:51:53,834 --> 01:51:56,223
There's a delivery for you, Mr. Kleinfeld.

1395
01:51:56,954 --> 01:51:59,673
- From who?
- From my father...

1396
01:52:00,634 --> 01:52:02,113
...and my brother.

1397
01:52:05,234 --> 01:52:06,792
Adis, counselor.

1398
01:52:23,994 --> 01:52:27,225
Where the hell you been?
You know somebody tried to kill Kleinfeld?

1399
01:52:27,314 --> 01:52:31,466
I heard about it. Listen, me and Gail
are goin' out of town for a couple days.

1400
01:52:31,594 --> 01:52:34,188
- You're gonna get married.
- Listen to me.

1401
01:52:34,394 --> 01:52:38,672
I want you to go to Gail's house,
pick her up, drive her to Grand Central.

1402
01:52:38,754 --> 01:52:41,427
I want you to wait with her there for me.

1403
01:52:41,714 --> 01:52:45,423
Train leaves 11:30 sharp.
We can't miss this train, understand?

1404
01:52:45,754 --> 01:52:47,551
You got me? Go ahead.

1405
01:53:08,074 --> 01:53:09,951
It's me, Pete Amadesso.

1406
01:53:10,034 --> 01:53:13,231
- Remember me?
- How ya doin'?

1407
01:53:13,794 --> 01:53:15,671
- Good.
- What're you doin' here?

1408
01:53:15,834 --> 01:53:19,588
We heard this was your joint.
Nice! Come by to say "hello."

1409
01:53:19,714 --> 01:53:21,944
Good to see you. How you doin'?

1410
01:53:22,114 --> 01:53:24,503
- Good to see you. Yeah, long time.
- Long time.

1411
01:53:24,594 --> 01:53:26,312
Sit down. Have a drink with us.

1412
01:53:26,394 --> 01:53:28,464
Come on. Sit down.

1413
01:53:30,914 --> 01:53:34,543
I said: "Shit, I ain't seen Carlito
in what, fifteen years?"

1414
01:53:35,074 --> 01:53:36,905
Fifteen. Yeah, gotta be. Sure.

1415
01:53:36,994 --> 01:53:38,871
- Long time.
- Long fuckin' time.

1416
01:53:39,114 --> 01:53:42,186
- Sorry. Joe Battaglia.
- My pleasure. Good to see you.

1417
01:53:42,274 --> 01:53:43,787
Sonny Manzanero.

1418
01:53:44,234 --> 01:53:46,111
- How ya doin'?
- Carlito Brigante.

1419
01:53:47,474 --> 01:53:50,910
Me and Carlito used to push
a little skag back in '57, '58.

1420
01:53:51,194 --> 01:53:52,832
Couple of fuckin' kids.

1421
01:53:53,354 --> 01:53:56,266
First time I saw this guy,
I thought he was Italian!

1422
01:53:57,714 --> 01:53:58,669
Look at him!

1423
01:53:58,794 --> 01:54:00,113
Shit!

1424
01:54:00,994 --> 01:54:04,111
Pete Amadesso walks into my club
just like that.

1425
01:54:04,674 --> 01:54:05,743
Bullshit.

1426
01:54:05,834 --> 01:54:08,473
There's an angle here. Pete's a made guy.

1427
01:54:08,554 --> 01:54:11,512
His uncle's a heavy hitter
with the Pleasant Avenue bunch.

1428
01:54:11,594 --> 01:54:15,223
What's he doin' here?
Probably Tony T.'s people sent him.

1429
01:54:16,554 --> 01:54:19,466
Maybe he's watchin' me, seein' if I break.

1430
01:54:20,714 --> 01:54:22,591
Waitin' for me to panic.

1431
01:54:24,234 --> 01:54:27,146
They still don't know for sure
if I was on that boat.

1432
01:54:27,234 --> 01:54:29,464
They think, but they don't know.

1433
01:54:30,354 --> 01:54:33,710
'Cause if they knew, I'd already be dead.

1434
01:54:35,194 --> 01:54:38,391
Right now, they just watchin' me.

1435
01:54:38,914 --> 01:54:42,429
He was always one of us.
That was a guy. That's who he is.

1436
01:54:42,954 --> 01:54:44,546
And we gotta know that.

1437
01:54:44,994 --> 01:54:46,950
So anyway, so I says to the guy:

1438
01:54:47,754 --> 01:54:51,542
"Tommy, Carlito ain't no fuckin' nigger.
Look at the way he dances!"

1439
01:54:53,834 --> 01:54:55,825
He dances like an Italian!

1440
01:54:57,074 --> 01:55:01,386
You should see him do the tarantella!
Waiter, get over here.

1441
01:55:02,514 --> 01:55:05,870
Bring these guys the best champagne
we got on the house.

1442
01:55:06,194 --> 01:55:08,947
- Where you goin'? Stay with us.
- I'm a workin' man.

1443
01:55:09,034 --> 01:55:11,468
Let me do what I gotta do.
I'll be right back.

1444
01:55:11,594 --> 01:55:12,583
Okay, buddy.

1445
01:55:48,834 --> 01:55:49,983
Motherfucker!

1446
01:55:53,794 --> 01:55:54,783
Fuck.

1447
01:56:05,274 --> 01:56:06,548
You seen the guy?

1448
01:56:09,634 --> 01:56:10,703
Saso.

1449
01:56:52,034 --> 01:56:54,184
- Where's my money?
- What're you talking about?

1450
01:56:54,274 --> 01:56:55,707
- Where's my money?
- I don't know.

1451
01:56:55,794 --> 01:56:59,230
You heard Kleinfeld got whacked,
so you figured I was dead, too!

1452
01:56:59,434 --> 01:57:02,665
- You thought you inherited my money?
- I swear...

1453
01:57:02,794 --> 01:57:05,592
Where's my money?
I'll cut your fuckin' liver out!

1454
01:57:05,834 --> 01:57:07,108
Okay. Okay.

1455
01:57:07,714 --> 01:57:11,229
It's in the box, under the register.
I was gonna tell you.

1456
01:57:18,154 --> 01:57:20,349
I want you to meet a good friend of mine.

1457
01:57:25,714 --> 01:57:28,592
You ever hear of Vinnie's father,
Tony Taglialucci?

1458
01:57:30,314 --> 01:57:33,067
Tony T. Yeah, he passed away recently.
Sorry about that.

1459
01:57:33,554 --> 01:57:36,022
I hear your Jew lawyer
met with an accident.

1460
01:57:36,194 --> 01:57:38,754
I haven't seen him lately. What is this?

1461
01:57:40,114 --> 01:57:42,992
I told you bring the best out,
you bring me this cheap shit?

1462
01:57:43,074 --> 01:57:44,223
Come on. Excuse me.

1463
01:57:46,394 --> 01:57:49,511
- Vinnie, slow down.
- "Ain't seen him lately!" The lyin' fuck!

1464
01:57:49,594 --> 01:57:53,143
- Seen him in the hospital!
- We'll take him outside. Sit down.

1465
01:58:00,554 --> 01:58:02,306
Relax, we'll get him.

1466
01:58:37,994 --> 01:58:39,791
Where the hell is he?

1467
01:58:49,994 --> 01:58:53,350
- The little fuckin' spic bastard!
- Where you going, man?

1468
01:58:53,554 --> 01:58:57,342
- Nobody gets back here!
- Damn it, get the fuck out of here!

1469
01:59:03,674 --> 01:59:06,268
Come on, let's go. We'll get him outside.

1470
01:59:16,154 --> 01:59:17,951
There he is! Come on!

1471
02:00:36,394 --> 02:00:37,907
What do you want me to do?

1472
02:00:40,594 --> 02:00:42,232
I can't do nothin'.

1473
02:01:03,074 --> 02:01:04,666

02:09:51,474 --> 02:09:52,623
No, you stay here.

1520
02:09:59,154 --> 02:10:00,633
Don't try to talk.

1521
02:10:01,234 --> 02:10:04,510
We're gonna get you to a hospital.
You're gonna be okay.

1522
02:10:04,594 --> 02:10:07,267
Just hold on, baby. Just hold on.

1523
02:10:08,834 --> 02:10:11,587
Hold on, baby. Please, hold on.

1524
02:10:13,634 --> 02:10:14,783
Take this.

1525
02:10:20,474 --> 02:10:22,988
Take it and get out.

1526
02:10:24,594 --> 02:10:25,913
Both of you.

1527
02:10:36,714 --> 02:10:38,193
You'll be okay.

1528
02:10:43,274 --> 02:10:46,391
Don't leave me, Charlie. Not yet.

1529
02:10:47,194 --> 02:10:49,628
Don't leave me, Charlie.

1530
02:10:51,474 --> 02:10:52,668
Don't go.

1531
02:11:04,794 --> 02:11:06,591
Please don't leave me.

1532
02:11:08,674 --> 02:11:09,868
Don't go.

1533
02:11:13,434 --> 02:11:15,311
You can't do this to me.

1534
02:11:17,394 --> 02:11:19,589
Oh, God. Don't leave me.

1535
02:12:04,674 --> 02:12:05,993
Sorry, boys...

1536
02:12:07,194 --> 02:12:10,664
...all the stitches in the world
can't sew me together again.

1537
02:12:11,994 --> 02:12:15,589
Lay down. Lay down.

1538
02:12:16,074 --> 02:12:19,623
Gonna stretch me out
in Fernandez Funeral Home on 109th St.

1539
02:12:20,994 --> 02:12:23,383
Always knew I'd make a stop there...

1540
02:12:24,234 --> 02:12:27,351
...but a lot later
than a whole gang of people thought.

1541
02:12:28,394 --> 02:12:30,146
Last of the Mo-Ricans.

1542
02:12:31,434 --> 02:12:33,345
Well, maybe not the last.

1543
02:12:35,834 --> 02:12:37,825
Gail's gonna be a good mom.

1544
02:12:38,714 --> 02:12:41,626
New, improved Carlito Brigante.

1545
02:12:43,714 --> 02:12:46,023
Hope she uses the money to get out.

1546
02:12:46,554 --> 02:12:49,432
No room in this city
for big hearts like hers.

1547
02:12:50,234 --> 02:12:51,508
Sorry, baby.

1548
02:12:52,874 --> 02:12:56,753
I tried the best I could. Honest.

1549
02:12:58,154 --> 02:13:00,748
Can't come with me on this trip, though.

1550
02:13:02,514 --> 02:13:04,232
Gettin' the shakes now.

1551
02:13:04,994 --> 02:13:08,589
Last call for drinks. Bar's closin' down.

1552
02:13:09,794 --> 02:13:11,386
Sun's out.

1553
02:13:12,154 --> 02:13:13,951
Where we goin' for breakfast?

1554
02:13:15,354 --> 02:13:17,026
Don't wanna go far.

1555
02:13:18,554 --> 02:13:19,873
Rough night.

1556
02:13:21,074 --> 02:13:22,348
Tired baby...

1557
02:13:23,794 --> 02:13:24,943
...tired.
