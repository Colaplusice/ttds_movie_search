1
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,360
Having reached the end
of my sinner's life...

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,680
my hair now white...

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,760
I prepare to leave
on this parchment my testimony...

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,360
as to the wondrous
and terrible events...

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,640
I witnessed in my youth...

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,920
at the end of the year of 1327.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,440
May God grant me
the wisdom and grace...

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,160
to be the faithful chronicler
of the happenings that took place...

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,400
in a remote abbey
in the dark north of ltaly.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,760
An abbey whose name
it may seem, even now...

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,920
bias andprudent to omit.

12
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,360
THE NAME OF THE ROSE

13
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,760
May my hand not tremble
now that I start...

14
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,440
to relieve the past and
revive the feelings of uneasiness...

15
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,520
that opressed my heart
as we entered the battlements.

16
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,600
Should we tell him?

17
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,080
No. He will look
in the wrong places.

18
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,640
But...

19
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,680
what if he learns it
of his own account?

20
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,000
You're overestimating
his talents.

21
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,560
There's only one authority
capable of investigating such matters.

22
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,800
The holly lnquisition.

23
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,440
What's your opinion,
venerable Jorge?

24
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,080
Dear brothers...

25
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,320
I leave such worldly
matters to younger men.

26
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,520
Adso?

27
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,960
-Yes, master.
-To command nature...

28
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,400
one must learn
to obey it, huh?

29
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,640
So, return to the court,
turn the building on your left...

30
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,560
enter the court on you right.
You'll find the place you're in need of...

31
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,360
behind the third arch.

32
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,040
But you told me you'd never
been to this abbey.

33
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,960
When we arrived, I saw a
brother making this way so hazily.

34
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,600
But he left more slowly,
with an air of content.

35
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,800
Thank you, master.

36
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,040
On behalf of the Benedict Order..

37
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,720
I'm honored to welcome you
and your Franciscan brothers...

38
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,520
to our abbey.

39
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,320
The other delegates
have arrived?

40
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,880
Ubertino de Casale has been
here for some weeks...

41
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,000
the others are due tomorrow.

42
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,160
You must be very tired
after your long journey.

43
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,600
Not particularly.

44
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,800
You're not in need
of anything?

45
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,360
No, thank you.

46
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,680
Well... then l...

47
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,880
I beech you peace.

48
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,680
I'm sorry to see that
one of your brothers...

49
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,640
has recently gone
to God.

50
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,080
Yes, a terrible loss.

51
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,440
Brother Adelmo was one
of our finest illuminates.

52
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,840
-Not, Adelmo of Otranto?
-You knew him?

53
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,840
No, but I knew and
admired his work.

54
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,480
His humor and comic
images were almost infamous.

55
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,040
But he was said to be very young.

56
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,400
Ah, yes! Very young indeed.

57
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,960
An accident, no doubt.

58
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,920
Yes, as you say, an accident.

59
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,840
Well... that is l...

60
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,800
Brother William...

61
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,840
may I speak to you candidly?

62
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,960
You seem anxious to do so.

63
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,880
When I heard you were coming
to our abbey...

64
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,480
I thought it was an answer
to my prayers.

65
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,400
I said: "He's a man who has the
knowledge both of the human spirit...

66
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,680
and of the wilds of the evil one."

67
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,400
Brother Adelmo's death
has caused much...

68
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,480
spiritual
uneasy upon my flock.

69
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,840
This is my novice, Adso.

70
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,640
The youngest son of the
Baron de Melk.

71
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,200
Please, do continue.

72
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,480
We found the body
after a heavy storm...

73
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,240
horribly mutilated...

74
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,080
cast against a rock in
front of the tower...

75
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,800
under a window that was...
How should I say this?

76
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,240
-which was...
-which was found closed.

77
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,880
-Somebody told you?
-lf it was opened...

78
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,480
You'd not have mentioned
spiritual uneasy.

79
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,200
-He'd have fallen.
-Brother William...

80
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,760
the window can't be opened...

81
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,200
nor was the glass shattered.

82
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,200
There's no access
through the roof above.

83
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,040
I see. As you can't
find a natural explanation...

84
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,120
the monks suspect the
presence of supernatural forces.

85
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,880
I need the help of an
acute man such as you.

86
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,920
Acute in uncovering and
prudent, if necessary...

87
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,600
in covering up before
the papal delegates arrive.

88
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,720
You know I no longer deal
in such matters.

89
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,560
I'm reluctant to burden
you with my dilemma, but...

90
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,280
unless I can tranquilize
my flock...

91
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I have no alternative but
turn to the lnquisition.

92
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,560
That is Ubertino de Casale...

93
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,080
one of the greatest spiritual
leaders of our Order.

94
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,520
Come.

95
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,640
Many revere him
as a living saint...

96
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,240
but others would have him
burnt as a heretic.

97
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,080
His book on the poverty
of the clergy...

98
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,600
isn't favorite
reading in the papal palace.

99
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,240
So, now he lives
in hiding.

100
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,080
Dear Franciscans...

101
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,680
you must leave
this place at once.

102
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,840
The devil's roaming this abbey!

103
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,600
Ubertino, it's, William.

104
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,760
Willian of Baskerville.

105
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,080
William is dead.

106
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,960
William... my son...

107
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,120
forgive me.

108
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,960
We lost trace ofyou
for so long!

109
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,040
I tried hard to be forgotten.

110
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,160
When we heard of your
troubles...

111
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,040
I prayed to our Virgin
for a miracle.

112
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,040
Your prayers met with a
favorable response.

113
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,880
This is my young novice,
Adso de Melk.

114
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,080
His father has entrusted
me his education and wealth.

115
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,000
Let him out of here at once!
Haven't you heard the devil...

116
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,800
is hurling beautiful
boys out of windows?

117
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,760
There was something feminine...

118
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:00,640
something diabolical...
about the young one who died.

119
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,280
He had the eyes of a girl...

120
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,200
seeking into course
with the devil.

121
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,720
Beware of this place.

122
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,840
The beast is still
among us.

123
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,880
I can sense him...
now... here...

124
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,840
within these very walls.
I'm afraid, William.

125
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:36,200
For you, for me.
For the outcome of this debate...

126
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:43,280
My son!
The times we're living!

127
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:52,240
Let's not frighten
our young friend.

128
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,920
She's beautiful, isn't she?

129
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:07,640
When a female...
by nature so perverted...

130
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,640
becomes sublime by holiness...

131
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,320
then she can be the
noble vehicle of grace.

132
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:27,680
Beautiful are the breasts...
which feed only one baby.

133
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,840
-I don't like this place.
-Really?

134
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,360
I find it thrillingly.
Come.

135
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,920
We must not allow ourselves
to be influenced...

136
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,080
by irrational rumors
of the antichrist.

137
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,160
Let's instead exercise
our brains...

138
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,720
and try to solve this enigma.

139
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,320
May you receive more in Heaven...

140
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,320
for what you've given in Earth.

141
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,720
My master trusted
Aristotle, the Greek philosopher...

142
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,320
and in his remarkable
logic intelligence.

143
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,760
Unhappily, my fears
were not...

144
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,960
mere phantoms
of my youthful imagination.

145
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,960
A rather dark end for such
a brilliant illuminate.

146
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,040
Another generous donation
by the Church to the poor.

147
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,080
What if it wasn't that tower
he fell from...

148
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,360
but somewhere over there and
the body rolled all the way down here?

149
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,320
No devil needed anymore.

150
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,040
There's more blood here.

151
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
That's where he fell from.

152
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,960
He jumped.

153
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,680
-Are you paying attention?
-Yes, he jumped.

154
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,800
Jumped? You mean that
he committed suicide?

155
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,840
Why else would someone go up
there in the middle of a rainstorm?

156
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,080
Not to admire the landscape.

157
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,280
Perhaps someone murdered him.

158
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,880
And then towed all the
way up there with the body?

159
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,120
Much easier to get rid of it
through that small door.

160
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,480
My dear Adso.
It seems elementary.

161
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,080
Suicide?

162
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,760
Do you think this is a place
abandoned by God?

163
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,360
Have you ever known a place
where God would've felt at home?

164
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,360
We pray, oh, mighty God,
that there are no grounds...

165
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,800
for suspecting the presence
of an evil spirit among us...

166
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,240
either of this world or another.

167
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,280
We praise our Lord
that the debate...

168
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,960
we are so greatly honored to host...

169
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,160
may now proceed
without a shadow of fear.

170
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,720
We also praise oh mighty
for sending us brother William...

171
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,920
whose experience and
previous duties...

172
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,400
although onerous to him...
has been of such service to us here.

173
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,200
May serenity and
spiritual peace...

174
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,920
reign once more
in our hearts.

175
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,280
A monk must be quiet.

176
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,440
He mustn't speak
what he's thinking...

177
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:44,760
until he's asked.

178
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,960
A monk mustn't laugh.

179
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:56,120
That's what fools are for...

180
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,920
who raise their voices in laughter.

181
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,960
Master, if I may ask what...

182
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,120
onerous duties was
the abbot talking about?

183
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,960
Were you not always a monk?

184
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,400
Even monks have past, Adso.

185
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,440
Now, try to sleep.

186
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,240
Just...

187
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,920
Yes, master.

188
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:55,840
There's sadness in wisdom.

189
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,840
The one who increases his knowledge...

190
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:05,240
also increases his suffering.

191
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,840
A calamity!

192
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,880
It was a calamity!

193
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,360
Father! A tragedy in the pigpen!

194
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,480
Come! Come quickly!

195
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,080
This one, I admit, didn't
commit suicide.

196
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,920
Water!

197
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,200
Venancius, the Greek translator!

198
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,160
I'm to blame. Had I not been so eager
to believe your convenient explanation...

199
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,200
this second tragedy
might've been prevented.

200
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,400
I'm convinced brother Adelmo
took his own life.

201
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,120
Whether this death is connected
with it. I intend to find.

202
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,000
"After the heavy storm,
with the second trumpet..."

203
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,600
"the sea became blood."

204
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:27,200
-And hold... there's blood here!
-The prophecy of the Apocalypse.

205
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,720
"With the third trumpet,
a burning star..."

206
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,440
"will fall in fountains of water'

207
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,920
The devil is here!

208
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,080
Grated stem bistort
for treating diarrhea.

209
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,040
As for onions, administered
in small quantities...

210
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,520
warm and moist, they help to
prolong the male erection.

211
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,960
In those who haven't taken
our vows, naturally.

212
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,720
Do you apply arsenic in
many circumstances?

213
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,200
Yes, indeed.

214
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,560
This effective remedy for
nervous disorders.

215
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,240
If taken in small doses.

216
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,600
And what if not in so small doses?

217
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,200
Death.

218
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,200
What was his function here?

219
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,520
He was our finest translator
of Greek.

220
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,480
Entirely devoted to the works
of Aristotle.

221
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,120
Was he in friendly terms with
the handsome Adelmo?

222
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,680
Yes. They worked together in
the escritoire.

223
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,680
But in a brotherly way
understand? Not like...

224
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,680
I mean... flesh can be tempted
according to nature...

225
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,440
or against nature.

226
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,560
And they weren't allowed to
this position... you see!

227
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,440
Penitengiazite!

228
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,200
Watch out for Satan,
who comes to know your soul.

229
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,480
Death is supreme.

230
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,480
Contemplating my sanctuary?

231
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,560
There, we have the devil.

232
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,480
As ugly as Salvatore.

233
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,160
My little brother,
penitenziagite.

234
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,400
"Penitenziagite"?

235
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,200
I didn't say that.

236
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,840
You said "penitenziagite".
I heard.

237
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,760
Noble father, "magnifico"!

238
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:29,120
I don't have a good rhetoric.
I said "penitence".

239
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,760
I'm a monk. Saint Benedict!
Saint Benedict!

240
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,080
Salvatore, come here.

241
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,480
Master, what language was
he speaking?

242
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,520
All languages and none.

243
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,480
And what was the word you
both repeated?

244
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,320
"Penitenziagite"?

245
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,240
-What does it mean?
-That the hunchback, undoubtedly...

246
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,440
was once a herectic.

247
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,360
"Penitenziagite" was the rally
cry of Dolcinites.

248
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,440
Dolcinites? Who were they?

249
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,400
Those who believed
in the poverty of Christ.

250
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,480
So do we, Franciscans.

251
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,120
But they also declared everyone
must be poor.

252
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,280
So, they slaughtered the rich.

253
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,320
You see, Adso...

254
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,440
the step between ecstatic vision
and sinful frenzy...

255
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,680
is all too brief.

256
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,480
So, could he not have killed
the translator?

257
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,760
No. Fat bishops and wealthy priests...

258
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,560
were more to the taste
of the Dolcinites...

259
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,720
not a specialist of Aristotle.

260
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,120
But you're right, we must
keep the mind open.

261
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,720
We're fortunate to have such
a snowy ground here.

262
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,520
It's the parchment on which
the criminal, unwillingly...

263
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,320
writes his autograph.

264
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,920
What do you mean from these
footprints here?

265
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,160
They're twice as deep as the
others, Master.

266
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,840
Good! And thus we may conclude...

267
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,760
That the man was very heavy.

268
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,840
Precisely! And why was
he very heavy?

269
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,480
Because... he was very fat?

270
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,920
Or because he was carrying
another man.

271
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:43,560
Let's commit the autograph
of this sole to our memory.

272
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,440
But the footprints lead away
from the jar, in this direction.

273
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,160
Adso, you're discounting
the possibility...

274
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,600
that the man was walking
backwards, dragging the body...

275
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,920
into the furrows
created by the heels.

276
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,840
Where did the erudite
Greek translator...

277
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,760
meet the anonymous
author of his death?

278
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,480
Brother librarian...

279
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,640
perhaps you'd permit us to examine
the work of the two unfortunates...

280
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,600
who were so distressingly
gone to God.

281
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,240
-Your request's most unusual.
-As are the circumstances of their deaths.

282
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,160
Brother Adelmo sat there.

283
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,240
Eyeglasses in frames.

284
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,960
A donkey teaching the
Scriptures to the bishops.

285
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,640
The pope as a fox.
And the abbot as a monkey.

286
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,960
He had a daring talent
for comic images.

287
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:52,760
A monk must not laugh!
Only fools laugh for nothing!

288
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,840
I trust my words didn't
offend you brother William...

289
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,240
but I heard them laughing
at unlaughable things.

290
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,880
You, Franciscans, however,
belong to an Order...

291
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,680
where merriment is viewed
with indulges.

292
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,760
Yes, it's true. Saint Francis
was much disposed to laughter.

293
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,280
Laughter's a devil's squint
which deforms the face...

294
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,800
and makes men look
like monkeys.

295
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,200
Monkeys do not laugh.
Laughter's particular to man.

296
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,360
As a sin.
Christ never laughed.

297
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,560
Can you be so sure?

298
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,400
There's nothing in the
Scriptures to say that He did.

299
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,880
There's nothing there
to say He didn't.

300
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,640
Even the saints also
employed comedy...

301
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,400
to ridicule the enemies
of the faith.

302
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,520
For example, when the
pagans plunged Saint Maurus...

303
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,960
into the boiling water,
he complained...

304
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,440
that his bath was cold.
The Sultan put his hand in...

305
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,240
-and burnt himself.
-A saint...

306
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,640
immersed in boiling water
doesn't play childish tricks.

307
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:59,360
He restrains his cries
and suffers for the truth.

308
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,960
And yet, Aristotle devoted his second
book of poetics to comedy...

309
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,560
as an instrument of truth.

310
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,040
Have you read this work?

311
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,680
Of course not.
It's been lost for centuries.

312
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,640
No, it's not!
It was never written!

313
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,960
Because Providence doesn't
want futile things glorified.

314
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,560
-That I must contempt.
-Enough!

315
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,960
This abbey is overshadowed by grief.
Yet you would...

316
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,400
intrude on our sorrows
with idle banter!

317
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,840
Forgive me, Venerable Jorge.
My remarks were truly out of place.

318
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,440
Which was the Greek
translator's desk?

319
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,600
This one.

320
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,960
Come, Adso.

321
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,800
-What'd you deduce from that visit?
-That we're not meant to laugh in there.

322
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,560
But you noticed how few books
there were on the escritoire's shelves?

323
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
All those scriveners, copyists,
translators, researchers...

324
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,240
thinkers... Where are the books
needed for their work...

325
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,440
and for which this abbey
is famous?

326
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,680
Where are the books?

327
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,920
-Are you testing me?
-What do you mean?

328
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
With all due respect...

329
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,480
it seems that whenever you ask me a
question, you already have the answer.

330
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,400
Do you know where the books are?

331
00:35:53,600 --> 00:36:01,600
No, but I've faith that that
tower contains something other than air.

332
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:15,400
Did you see the little door
the librarian closed as we came in?

333
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,080
That leads to the library?

334
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,080
Master! Quick! I have him!

335
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,840
-Stop! Enough.
-He tried to kill us.

336
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,640
Salvatore!

337
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:56,320
Please, don't talk to the abbot
about his past.

338
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,800
He's innocent of the deaths
in this abbey. I swear it.

339
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,720
Brother Remigio, my price is
some information.

340
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,720
I couldn't comprehend
why my master so quickly dismissed...

341
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,840
my suspicions for the
heretic hunchback...

342
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,040
and why it was so urgent
that we visited the tower.

343
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,880
I assumed he couldn't
resist the temptation...

344
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,920
to penetrate the library
and look at the books.

345
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,600
No lock. Just as I thought,
it must be bolted from inside.

346
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,400
How do we get in?

347
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,800
Obviously, there must be
another entrance.

348
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,200
Let's see what the moon-faced
assistant librarian...

349
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,520
was trying to conceal this morning.

350
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,040
Tiny Greek letters.

351
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,960
Perhaps written by an ant
with ink feet.

352
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,600
"Have fun with the defects
of vulgar people."

353
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,880
Written with lemon juice.

354
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,000
Sagittarius... Sun... Mercury...

355
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,800
Scorpion.

356
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,680
It's a zodiac code...
giving directions...

357
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,960
but to where?

358
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,480
Who's there?
Who's there?

359
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,560
-My magnifying glasses...
-They were in that book.

360
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,880
You go that way.

361
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,040
Come on out, you little bitch!

362
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,280
I know you're here.
I can smell you.

363
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,720
What's the matter with you?
Are you afraid of me?

364
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I'll find you.

365
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,960
Who was she?

366
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,720
Who was this creature
that rose like the dawn...

367
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,200
bewitched as the moon,
radiant as the sun..

368
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,600
terrible as an army
poised for battle?

369
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,280
Good evening, Salvatore.

370
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,400
This is where you catch them?

371
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,400
Here they're "piu grassi",
bigger.

372
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,000
Do you eat them?

373
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,440
-Do you like?
-Thank you, no.

374
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,240
"lch bin" good catholic.

375
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,120
As you're a good Christian,
you must tell me.

376
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,320
So Adelmo gave the
parchment to Berengar?

377
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:54,160
No. To the trans... tran...

378
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,000
Translator! Venancius,
the black monk.

379
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,840
What happened then?

380
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,280
Master! Here, quick!
I found another one.

381
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,160
Where are your wits, boy?

382
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,080
Have you ever met anyone with a
rib cage large enough to accommodate...

383
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,760
a heart of those dimensions?

384
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,960
This is the heart of an ox.

385
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,360
One of the monks probably
gave it to that peasant girl...

386
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,760
in exchange for her favors.

387
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,160
A girl? What?

388
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,360
The one I saw out of here.

389
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:20,520
-He must've been a very ugly monk.
-Why ugly?

390
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,320
If he'd been young and beautiful,
she'd have blessed him...

391
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,480
with her carnal favors for nothing.

392
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,160
Whatever happened in this
dreadful kitchen...

393
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,960
has no bearing on
our investigations.

394
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,320
The hunchback's convinced
me that brother Berengar...

395
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,400
the assistant librarian,
is the key to the whole enigma.

396
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,840
-What did you say?
-Nothing, master.

397
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,360
Good.

398
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,280
Master?

399
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:14,400
There's something I must tell you.

400
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,520
I know.

401
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,200
Then, you'll hear my confession?

402
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:27,440
I'd rather you told me
first as a friend.

403
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,880
Master...

404
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,520
Have you ever been...

405
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:43,360
in love?

406
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,160
In love?

407
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,000
-Many times.
-You were?

408
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,960
Of course. Aristotle, Ovid,
Virgil...

409
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,800
No. I meant with a...

410
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:01,440
Are you not confusing love
with lust?

411
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,160
Am l?

412
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,040
I don't know.

413
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,400
I want to make her own good.

414
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:18,040
I want her to be happy.
I want to save her from poverty.

415
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,240
Oh, dear!

416
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:25,840
-Why "oh, dear"?
-You are in love.

417
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,200
Is that bad?

418
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,840
For a monk it presents
certain problems.

419
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,440
But doesn't St Thomas Aquinas
praise love above all the virtues?

420
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:41,040
Yes, the love of God, Adso.
Love of God!

421
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,560
And the love of... woman?

422
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,480
Of woman, Thomas Aquinas
knew very little.

423
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:57,920
The Scriptures are very clear.
Proverbs warns us.

424
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,600
Woman takes possession of a
man's precious soul.

425
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,120
Ecclesiastes tells us:

426
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,560
"More bitter than death is woman."

427
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,040
Yes, but what do you think, master?

428
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:17,440
Of course, I don't have the benefit
of your experience...

429
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:23,360
but I find it difficult
to convince myself that...

430
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,560
God'd have introduced such
a being into creation...

431
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,520
without endowing her
with some virtues.

432
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,560
How peaceful life'd be
without love, Adso.

433
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,080
How safe... how tranquil...

434
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,440
and how dull.

435
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,560
God, You've guided us to
this refuge...

436
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,560
of spiritual peace because
you wish for reconciliation...

437
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,160
as much as we, Franciscans.

438
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,360
Let's go, brothers!

439
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,840
Brother Berengar?

440
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,680
He's probably hiding
somewhere...

441
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,480
with the book and
my magnifying glasses.

442
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,520
Brother Berengar?

443
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,560
Master, look! The door!

444
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,960
Brother Malaquias!

445
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:10,000
I was looking for brother Berengar.
Is he here?

446
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,160
No.

447
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:17,120
I see. Do you know where
we might find him?

448
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,880
No.

449
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,360
Or is he perhaps upstairs,
in the library?

450
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,400
No.

451
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,600
I'm curious to see the library
for myself. May I do so?

452
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,680
No.

453
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,880
Why not?

454
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,400
It's strict order of the abbot.

455
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,120
No one's permitted
to enter the library...

456
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,200
other than myself and my assistant.

457
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,520
I see. Thank you again.

458
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:00,400
Maybe something's happened to him.

459
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,160
Maybe we'll find him in the water.

460
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,560
-What?
-The third trumpet...

461
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:09,560
as Ubertino said.
The book of Revelation.

462
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,320
That's not the book we're after.

463
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,600
Is it a chicken for you?
It's more like a sparrow.

464
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,040
Franciscans.

465
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,520
Welcome to our abbey,
brother Michele.

466
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,520
And your fellow Franciscan
delegates.

467
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,440
Get in the line like the others!

468
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,440
Salvatore, let him go!

469
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,160
This is Cuthbert of Winchester...

470
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,080
one of our most esteemed
Franciscan guests.

471
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,720
Come, your grace. We have a
very urgent matter to discuss.

472
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,600
The abbot and his colleagues
believe...

473
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,280
the devil's at work
within these walls.

474
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,640
He is!

475
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,560
The only evidence I see
of the devil...

476
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,520
is everyone's desire to see
him at work.

477
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,000
What if Ubertino's right and
you're wrong?

478
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,560
This debate's
crucial to us all.

479
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,120
we suspect the Pope
wants to crash our Order.

480
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,360
-And declare us heretics.
-Yes, and declare us heretics.

481
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:32,040
I only have one brother to
question and the matter's resolved.

482
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,160
William, we place our trust
in you.

483
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,520
I pray God that you don't
abuse it.

484
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,440
Brother William.

485
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,560
Did you find a book in Greek?

486
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,120
I was right.

487
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,280
So was the book of
Revelation.

488
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,440
-We must talk at once.
-lndeed, we must.

489
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,800
And I have much to tell.

490
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:00,480
Just as he and I've
examined this corpse.

491
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,480
Lime leaves in the bath
are used to alleviate pain.

492
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,680
He was left-handed?

493
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,200
Brother Berengar was
inverted in many ways.

494
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,600
Are there other left-handed
brothers at the abbey?

495
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,440
Not that I know.

496
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,560
Ink stains.

497
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,760
He didn't write with his
tongue, I presume.

498
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:47,440
-A few lines in Greek.
-Yes, written by Venancius.

499
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,600
Notes from the book he
was reading...

500
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:55,440
just before he died.
You see how the calligraphy changes?

501
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:02,280
From this point on, he was dying.
And what can we conclude from that?

502
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:07,360
A spot of blue paint.

503
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:10,520
yes, but a unique spot
of blue...

504
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,400
blended by your finest
illuminate, brother Adelmo...

505
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,240
who had this parchment
before Venancius.

506
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:20,040
How do we know that?
Because those notes overrun...

507
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:24,040
Adelmo's blue spots,
and not vice-versa.

508
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,760
Brother William...

509
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:31,080
this abbey is enshrouded
in a terrifying mystery.

510
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,080
Yet, I detect nothing,
in your obscure citation...

511
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,840
that sheds light upon it.

512
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,840
Adso, the light.

513
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:48,720
Someone was in great pains
to conceal a secret...

514
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,200
of the first magnitude.

515
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,240
The calligraphy's, without
question, left-handed.

516
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:59,320
The only left-handed member
ofyour community is... or rather was...

517
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:03,040
brother Berengar,
the assistant librarian.

518
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:07,680
What kind of secret knowledge
would he not have privilege?

519
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:13,160
-I feel you're about to tell me.
-Books. Restricted books.

520
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:17,080
Spiritually dangerous books.

521
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,640
Everyone here knew of
the assistant's passion...

522
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,360
for handsome boys.
When the beautiful Adelmo...

523
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,400
wanted to read such a
forbidden book...

524
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:28,400
Berengar offered him the
key to its whereabouts...

525
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:31,400
inside that parchment...

526
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:35,400
in exchange for unnatural caresses.

527
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,520
Enough, William!

528
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:40,720
Adelmo submitted to
Berengar's lustful advances.

529
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,400
But afterwards wracked,
by remorse he wandered desperate...

530
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,800
in the graveyard, where
he met the Greek translator.

531
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,120
-How do you know?
-There was a witness.

532
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,280
The hunchback...

533
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,600
he sawAdelmo giving
this parchment to Venancius...

534
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,160
and running towards
the small tower...

535
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,560
and hurling himself
out of the window.

536
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,600
the night of my arrival,
while Berengar punished his sinful flesh...

537
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:10,160
Venancius, following
the instructions on the parchment...

538
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:14,120
entered the forbidden library
and found the book.

539
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:18,600
He took it back to his desk
and began to read it.

540
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,120
After scribbling down
those mysterious quotations...

541
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,680
he died with a blackstain
on his finger.

542
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:28,240
The assistant discovered the body...

543
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:32,760
and dragged it down to the pigpen
to avertsuspicion on him.

544
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,360
But he left his autograph behind.

545
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:38,400
The book remained
on the translator's desk.

546
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,360
Berengar returned there
last night and read it.

547
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:46,440
Soon after, overcome
by some agonizing pain...

548
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:49,600
he tried to take a soothing bath
with lime leaves...

549
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,440
and drawned.

550
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,120
He too had a black finger.

551
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,320
All three died because
ofa book which kills...

552
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,480
or for which men will kill.

553
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:04,280
Therefore, I urge you to grant
me access to the library.

554
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:09,800
Brother William, your pride
blinds you.

555
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,600
By idolizing reason...

556
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:18,120
you failed to see what's obvious
to everyone in this abbey.

557
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:24,320
The papal delegation's arrived.
Bernardo Gui.

558
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,240
Thank you, brother William.

559
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,720
We're grateful
for your efforts...

560
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,280
but I now ask you...

561
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:46,760
to refrain from further
investigations.

562
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:52,600
Happily, there'll be someone
arriving with the papal delegation...

563
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:58,600
who is a well-versed
in the wilds of the evil one.

564
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,680
A man, I believe,
you know too well.

565
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,760
Bernardo Gui...

566
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:15,400
of the lnquisition.

567
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,240
Master, who's Bernardo Gui?

568
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:32,200
I've been searching the
entire abbey for you!

569
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,560
Michele wishes to speak
with you at once.

570
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:38,160
Alone.

571
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:42,080
-You know who's coming?
-I know. Bernardo Gui.

572
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,280
Ubertino must be moved to
a safe place.

573
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:48,280
The arrangements have been made.
It's you that concerns us.

574
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:51,640
You must put aside these
totally irrelevant investigations.

575
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,360
Erroneous conclusions.

576
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,760
It's the truth. I'm right.

577
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,400
William's right,
he's always right!

578
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:01,200
No matter what the
consequences...

579
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:05,400
for himself or anyone else...
William of Baskerville...

580
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:09,360
must always prove
himself right.

581
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,240
Wasn't your vanity,
your intellectual pride...

582
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,120
that brought you into conflict
with Bernardo Gui before?

583
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,280
Do not dare fate
twice, William.

584
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:22,600
Not even the Emperor will be able to
save you if you tangle with Bernardo.

585
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,600
My flesh'd forgotten the
sinful pleasure she'd...

586
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:46,080
given me. But my soul
couldn't forget her.

587
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,720
And now?

588
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:55,920
Now that I saw herin the
midst of her poverty and squatter...

589
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,800
I praised God that
I was a Franciscan.

590
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,760
I wanted her to know
that I didn't belong to...

591
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:05,760
this abbeybut to an
order dedicated to lifting...

592
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:09,640
her people out of
their physical destitution.

593
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,360
And spiritual depravation.

594
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:15,520
Farewell William.
You're mad and arrogant.

595
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:20,800
But I love you and I'll
never cease to pray for you.

596
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:26,400
Goodbye, dear child.

597
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:31,880
Try not to learn too many bad
examples from your master.

598
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:36,320
He thinks too much.
Relying always on the...

599
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,120
deductions of his head.

600
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:44,840
Instead of trusting in the
prophetic capacities...

601
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,000
of his heart.
Learn to mortify your...

602
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:55,560
intelligence. Weep over
the wounds of our Lord...

603
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,000
and do throw away
those books!

604
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:04,760
There's a side of Ubertino
I truly envy.

605
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:08,920
Remember, fear the last trumpet,
my friends.

606
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:14,080
The next'll fall from the sky.
And then will come a thousand...

607
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:18,000
-scorpions.
-Yes, we won't forget.

608
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,560
Which one frightens you most?

609
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,680
They all do.

610
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,640
Look closely.

611
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:03,520
-That one.
-My choice exactly.

612
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,160
After you.

613
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,080
Those are the foundations
of the tower.

614
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:30,480
But how to reach the library?

615
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:34,960
The rats love parchment
even more than scholars do.

616
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,840
Let's follow him.

617
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:46,000
166, bolted door, 167...

618
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:48,600
168, 169, 170...

619
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,960
I knew it.

620
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,280
Adso! I knew it!

621
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,760
You realize...

622
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:41,440
we're in one of the greatest
libraries in the whole Christendom?

623
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,760
-How are we gonna find the book?
-ln time.

624
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:16,240
"The Beatus of Liebana".
That's a masterpiece.

625
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:22,440
And this is the version anoted
by Umberto de Bologna!

626
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:27,800
How many more rooms?
How many more books?

627
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:35,920
No one should be forbidden
to consult these books.

628
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:47,360
Perhaps they're thought to be
too precious, too fragile.

629
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,080
It's not that, Adso.

630
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:53,840
They contain a wisdom that's
different from ours...

631
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,320
and ideas that could
make us doubt...

632
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:01,000
the infallibility
of the word of God.

633
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,840
Master?

634
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,760
And doubt, Adso,
is the enemy offaith.

635
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,240
Master?

636
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:37,800
Master?

637
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:42,960
Master?
Wait for me!

638
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,480
I'm waiting foryou.

639
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,720
But I can hear you walking.

640
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:00,040
I'm not walking.
I'm down here.

641
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:20,280
Is that you up there?

642
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,200
Where are you?

643
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,720
I'm lost!

644
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:52,360
Well, Adso, it'd appear we're
in a labyrinth.

645
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,160
Are you still there?

646
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:10,760
Yes.
How do we get out?

647
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:15,480
With some difficulty.
At least.

648
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:20,520
You see, Adso, that's the charm
of a labyrinth.

649
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:25,040
Adso, staycalm.
Open a book...

650
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:28,360
read it aloud.
Leave the room you're in...

651
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:31,400
keep turning left.

652
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,160
"Love's not originated as a
trouble but it transforms into it..."

653
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,200
when it becomes
obsessive cause."

654
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:40,880
"lt was lb Hazm who said
the love sick person..."

655
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,120
"doesn't want to be healed
and his amorous reverie..."

656
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,440
"cause irregularbreathing
and quick pulse."

657
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:49,560
"He identifies amorous
melancholy with lincantropy..."

658
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,920
"the disease that induces
woof-like behavior in humans."

659
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,240
"The external appearance..."

660
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,160
"begins to change."

661
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:01,560
"Soon the eyes fail,
his lips dry..."

662
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:04,360
"his face becomes postuled."

663
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:08,400
"Marks resembling bites of
the dog appear in his face..."

664
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,800
"he ends his days
by prowling in the graveyards..."

665
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:16,040
"at night, like a wolf."

666
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,280
Master?

667
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,440
I see a lantern.

668
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:23,480
Don't move.
Stay where you are.

669
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,160
I see a man.

670
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,080
He's stopped.

671
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,240
What's he doing?

672
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,560
He's raising his lantern.

673
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,200
How many times?

674
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,960
Three times.

675
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:42,320
It's l.
Raise your lantern.

676
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,840
Look!

677
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,400
You foolish boy!

678
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,520
It's just a mirror.

679
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,840
Master!

680
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:18,440
-Save the books.
-I'm trying to save you!

681
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:29,880
A trap door, a mirror...
We're almost there.

682
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:43,240
If I've deciphered the instructions
of the translator correctly...

683
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,960
You didn't think me
so foolish as to surrender...

684
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,400
the parchment to the abbot
without making a copy, right?

685
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,880
"With the hand above the idol..."

686
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:09,600
"press the 1st. and the 7th.
of four'

687
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,320
Very good.

688
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,200
What idol?

689
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:19,040
That's what we're here
to find out.

690
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:21,400
The 1st and the 7th of four what?

691
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,840
If I knew the answer of everything
I'd teach Theology in Paris.

692
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,440
And... again.

693
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,880
You hear that?

694
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,080
It's my teeth, master.

695
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:39,520
-What?
-My teeth.

696
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:42,280
Don't be afraid.

697
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:46,520
I'm not afraid,
I'm cold.

698
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,920
-Well... we should return.
-Don't leave for my account.

699
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,040
I confess It deludes me
for the moment

700
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,160
Well... Iet me see...

701
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:04,400
to find the way out of a labyrinth...

702
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:08,200
you come to a fork
mark it with an arrow...

703
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,680
-Master.
-Please! I'm thinking.

704
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:18,720
If there are arrows
at the forks, then...

705
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,320
Well done, boy!

706
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:32,320
Your classical education
serves us well!

707
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:54,240
Give it to me.

708
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,120
Give me!

709
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:20,400
Bernardo, sprinkle me
with the sperm.

710
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,680
Then, you have the love.

711
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:34,280
Spit it, please.

712
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,080
Spit it over there.

713
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:42,400
Thank you.

714
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:51,080
Lucifer, be at my service,
for a woman's love.

715
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:11,680
Leave me! Leave me!

716
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,680
It's burning!

717
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,440
Bernardo, look what we found.

718
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,400
Search the creature.

719
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:05,080
Mr. Abbot, you invited me to
investigate...

720
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:09,120
the presence of the evil one
in your abbey...

721
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:12,600
and I already found it.

722
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:18,640
How many times have I seen
these objects of devil worship?

723
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:22,520
The black cock and the black cat!

724
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:25,200
She did it for the food,
not for the devil!

725
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:30,040
William de Baskerville must
recall the trial...

726
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:32,720
in which a woman confessed
to have had intercourse...

727
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,080
with the demon in the form
of a black cat.

728
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:39,040
You don't have draw on
my past experiences...

729
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:42,240
to formulate your conclusions.

730
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:47,160
No indeed. Not in the face of
irrefutable evidences.

731
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:51,560
A witch! A seduced monk!
Satanic rite!

732
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:55,880
Tomorrow we shall learn
if these events...

733
01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:01,680
are connected with the mystery
that afflicts your abbey.

734
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:05,880
Lock them up! So they'll sleep
safely tonight.

735
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:20,600
You said nothing!

736
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:25,560
I said nothing because there was
nothing to be said.

737
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,320
You're ready enough to speak
the truth...

738
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:32,680
when it comes to books
and ideas.

739
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,440
She's already burned flesh, Adso.

740
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:39,240
Bernardo Gui's spoken.
She's a witch.

741
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,920
It's not true and you know it!

742
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:44,400
I know.

743
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:49,320
I also know that anyone
who disputes the verdict...

744
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:53,760
of an inquisitor
is guilty of heresy.

745
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:00,200
You seem to know a lot about it.

746
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:04,200
Oh, yes.

747
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,360
Won't you tell me...

748
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:12,680
as a friend?

749
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:15,880
There's not much to tell.

750
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:22,240
I was an inquisitor, but
in the early days...

751
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:27,360
when the lnquisition struggled
to guide, no to punish.

752
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:33,360
Once, I had to preside the trial
of a man...

753
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:37,680
whose only crime was to
have translated a Greek book...

754
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:41,080
that conflicted with
the Holly Scriptures.

755
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:48,080
Bernardo Gui wanted to
condemn him as heretic.

756
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:52,160
I acquitted the man.

757
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:58,320
Gui accused me of heresy
for having defended him.

758
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,440
I appealed to the Pope.

759
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,200
I was brought to prison...

760
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:09,840
tortured...

761
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:20,200
and I recanted.

762
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:26,720
What happened then?

763
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,600
The man was burnt at stake...

764
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,760
and I'm still alive.

765
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,680
Brother Salvatore...

766
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:05,360
this torment causes me
as much pain as you.

767
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:12,400
You can end it before
we even begin.

768
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:16,680
Open the gates ofyour heart,
search the depths ofyour soul.

769
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:21,640
-Search!
-I'm searching, sir.

770
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,680
Then tell me...

771
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:34,680
who, among your brethren, is the
heretic responsible for these murders?

772
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,760
I don't know.

773
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,560
I don't know!
I know nothing!

774
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,800
Stupid. I don't know anything.

775
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,880
Did I lie awake that night,
suffering for the girl...

776
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:05,480
or for myself?
I did not know.

777
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:08,720
With the dawn, came
the emissaries of the Pope...

778
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:12,280
our adversaries of the debate.

779
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:17,400
But it meant so little
to me now.

780
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:42,240
Your Eminence,
venerable brothers...

781
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:45,960
at last we meet
for this long waiting debate!

782
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:49,080
We've all traveled
great distances...

783
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:51,960
to put an end to the dispute...

784
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:58,440
that has shaken the unity...
of our Holly Mother Church.

785
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,960
Good people throughout Christendom...

786
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,320
are directing their gazes
at these venerable walls...

787
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:09,600
anxiously awaiting our answer
to that question...

788
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:15,400
"Did Christ or did he not owe...

789
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,400
the clothes that He wore?"

790
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:31,840
Beloved brethren of
the Franciscan Order...

791
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,040
our Holly Father, the Pope,
has authorized me...

792
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:41,040
and these servants
to speak on his behalf.

793
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:45,280
The question's not whether
Christ was poor...

794
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:49,800
But whether the Church
should be poor!

795
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:53,080
You, Franciscans, wish to see...

796
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:55,680
the clergy renounce
its possessions...

797
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:57,680
and surrenderits richness.

798
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:01,320
The abbots dissipated
their sacred treasures...

799
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:04,400
and handed their fertile
land to the servs.

800
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,000
I found the book.

801
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:09,960
I found the book at the dispensary.
A book in Greek.

802
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,920
It's behind one of my jars.

803
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,440
Don't touch it.

804
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,520
Return, lock your self inside.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

805
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:24,160
...defying the Church on the resources
needed to combat the eager...

806
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:28,080
great flow of the infident.

807
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:32,400
You forget that even the
greatest monument to OurLord...

808
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:38,480
is a pale reflex of
His infinite Majesty and glory.

809
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:18,760
Brother, quick! Salvatore
confessed his heretic past...

810
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:23,560
and yours. You have little to
escape from the flames.

811
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:31,880
Thank you, brother.

812
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,960
I consider this an absurd!
I can'tstand it!

813
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:11,200
How dare you call the
Pope's brothel God's palace on Earth?

814
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,880
-Answer that, your Eminence!
-These murders are a sign.

815
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:18,600
-I don't believe it!
-Why not?

816
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,920
Gospel speaks categorically...

817
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,280
that Christ possessed
a purse!

818
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:24,880
It's a lie, and you know it!

819
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:28,920
Why did Our Lord tell
his disciples on seven occasions...

820
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,680
not to carry neither gold
nor silver?

821
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:41,920
You, please!

822
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:45,200
A matter's occurred of
utmost gravity.

823
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:48,560
Let me go! I swear
I didn't kill him!

824
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:51,160
I was in the barn
making the inventory.

825
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:53,560
I neverkilled anybody,
I swear it!

826
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:56,680
Then explain us
why you were escaping.

827
01:32:58,200 --> 01:32:59,640
I wasn't.

828
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,560
I've already ordered your arrest
in another choice.

829
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:05,920
I see now that I was correct.

830
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:09,880
If someone hadn't chosen to look
in the wrong direction...

831
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:14,880
many men of God would
still be with us.

832
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:27,000
"Hand above the idol,
1 and 7 of four..."

833
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:34,680
"Use vulgar persons.
Take pleasure from the defects."

834
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:38,840
Please, dear boy,
I'm trying to think.

835
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:41,280
So am l, master.

836
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,120
Then use your head
instead ofyour heart.

837
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:47,080
And we can make some progress.

838
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:50,160
Are the books more important
than people to you?

839
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:52,000
Did I say they were?

840
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:55,280
You never seem to care
about anyone!

841
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:59,040
Can't you show a little pity?

842
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:06,600
Perhaps that's the style
of my pity.

843
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:10,720
But pity won't save her from
the fire.

844
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:24,840
I remind all present that,
they're bound by their vow of obedience...

845
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,160
and on pain of excommunication...

846
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:32,040
to aim the lnquisitor in his
struggle against heresy.

847
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:35,160
To sit with me
on this tribunal...

848
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,920
and to share the burden
of the verdict...

849
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,840
I'd require the counsel...

850
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:44,640
of two fellowjudges.

851
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:56,760
My lord Abbot...

852
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:58,960
and...

853
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,000
Brother William of Baskerville.

854
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:45,400
Salvatore...

855
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:49,360
Salvatore!

856
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:00,120
Would you repeat your confession
of last night...

857
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:03,640
that you and your accomplice,
Remigio de Varagine...

858
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:06,760
were members of the heretical
Dolcinites?

859
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:30,720
Enough!

860
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:39,960
Remigio de Varagine, do you deny
the confession ofyour accomplice?

861
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:45,640
No.
I don't deny it.

862
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:50,120
I'm proud of it!

863
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:58,280
For the twelve years I lived here...
I stuffed my belly...

864
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:00,120
shagged my weak...

865
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:04,400
and squeezed the hungry peasants
for dimes.

866
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:08,320
But now you've given me strength...

867
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:13,160
to remember what I once believed
in with all my heart.

868
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,360
And for that I thank you.

869
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:19,640
To remember that you once looted
and burnt the property of the Church?

870
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:25,280
Yes! To give it back to
the people you stole it from!

871
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:28,840
And did you not kill many
bishops and priests?

872
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:33,720
Yes! I'd burn your people...

873
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:36,720
if I had the chance!

874
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:48,960
Holly Mary, Mother of God,
Hear my humble prayer.

875
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:54,120
I know that my sin was
very great...

876
01:37:55,480 --> 01:38:00,840
but I beg you to not let her
suffer for my wrongdoing.

877
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,120
Blessed Mother...

878
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:07,880
many years ago you granted
a miracle by saving my master.

879
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:12,480
Would you not do the same
for this girl?.

880
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:18,920
My master says that the
simple folk always pay for all.

881
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:26,240
But, please, Holly Mother,
do not let it be so.

882
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,400
Guilty is that witch...

883
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:33,840
who's seduced a monk...

884
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,880
and practiced his diabolical
rituals in this holly place.

885
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:43,080
Guilty is Salvatore...

886
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:46,160
who's confessed his
heretical past...

887
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:49,640
and was caught in flagrant
delito with a witch!

888
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:53,760
Guilty is Remigio de Varagine...

889
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:57,880
who's not regretted
his former heresies and was caught...

890
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:00,720
trying to escape after
murdering the herbalist Severinus.

891
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:03,880
That's a lie! I never killed
the herbalist...

892
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,760
or anyone else in this abbey!

893
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:08,240
I therefore, request you...

894
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:11,760
to confirm my
sentence, My lord abbot.

895
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:20,360
My heart is
full of sorrow...

896
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:24,120
but I can't find no
reason to contest...

897
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:27,400
the just sentence of
the Holly lnquisition.

898
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:32,360
And you, William of Baskerville?

899
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:42,760
Yes, he is guilty.

900
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:45,920
Guilty of having, in his youth...

901
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,280
misinterpreted the message
of the Gospels...

902
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:54,320
and he's guilty of having
confused...

903
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:57,840
the love of poverty with
the blind destruction...

904
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:00,920
of wealthy and property.

905
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:04,080
But, my lord abbot...

906
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:09,920
he's innocent of the crimes
that've bathed your abbey in blood.

907
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:14,800
For brother Remigio
cannot read Greek...

908
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,160
and this entire mystery
hinges on...

909
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:21,000
the theft and possession of a
book written in Greek...

910
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:24,160
and hidden in some secret
part of the library.

911
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:28,120
As the verdict of the
lnquisition was disputed by William...

912
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:31,800
we must extract the
prisoner's confession.

913
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:34,760
Take him to the forge
and show him the instruments.

914
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:41,320
I'll confess anything you
want, but don't torture me.

915
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:44,120
I can't go through a night
like Salvatore!

916
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:48,360
Very well.
Why did you kill them?

917
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:54,520
Why? I don't know why.

918
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,360
-Because you were inspired by the devil?
-Yes... that's it.

919
01:41:00,440 --> 01:41:07,160
I was inspired by the devil.
I'm inspired by the devil!

920
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:11,360
Adralmech, Lucifer,
I call for you...

921
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,000
Lords of Hell.

922
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:21,560
The shepherd has done
his duty...

923
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:26,120
and the infected sheep must
now be consigned to the purifying flames!

924
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:28,600
You may burn brother Remigio...

925
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:33,120
but you won't put a stop for the
crimes being committed in this abbey!

926
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:35,600
Other monks will meet
death here...

927
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:40,280
and they'll also have
black fingers and black tongues!

928
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:43,040
Your Eminence, I beg you...

929
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:46,160
we, Franciscans, are disappointed
with brother William.

930
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:49,680
Once more we've seen that
your theories protect heretics...

931
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:53,080
and lead to murder.
The debate's concluded.

932
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:56,920
Brother William
has relaxed...

933
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:01,280
into the errors of which
he was formerly perjured.

934
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:05,320
Having sought yet again
to shield a heretic...

935
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:08,440
from just punishment by
the lnquisition...

936
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:11,520
He'll come with me
to Avignon for confirmation...

937
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,480
of my sentence by Pope John.

938
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:30,640
I'm right.

939
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:37,200
Ifonlyl could find the book
andprove that Gui was wrong!

940
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:41,240
But the Antichrist
was victorious once more...

941
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:46,200
and nothing seemed to be
able to hinder him.

942
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,400
Come on.

943
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:25,560
When the pyres are light
tonight...

944
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:28,120
Let the flames purify...

945
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:31,280
each of us
in his own heart.

946
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:35,360
Let's return to what was,
and ever should be...

947
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:37,520
the office of this abbey:

948
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:40,080
the preservation of
knowledge.

949
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:45,520
Preservation, I said.
Not search for...

950
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:50,360
because there's no progress
in the history of knowledge...

951
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:55,360
merely a continuous
and sublime recapitulation.

952
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:58,720
Let's now pray oh mighty...

953
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:03,280
that the blood-eyed antichrist...

954
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:07,400
has been removed from our
sacred precincts...

955
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:12,320
and our monastery
has returned to peace.

956
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:24,520
The fifth trumpet had
the power of a thousand scorpions...

957
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:27,000
-He told me.
-Who told you?

958
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:30,000
His tongue's black
and his finger's black...

959
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:32,440
as brother William foretold!

960
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:47,920
It's brother Malachia, father.

961
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,480
-Malachia?
-Yes, father.

962
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:53,040
Dear God! Not Malachia!

963
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:56,040
Will it never end?

964
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:08,600
William of Baskerville
was right. He said...

965
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:11,920
Yes! He knew!

966
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:15,440
Just as I'd have known,
if I'd been the murderer!

967
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:17,680
Find William
of Baskerville!

968
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:19,400
We can't open the mirror!

969
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:23,000
Perhaps pressing the 1a and the
7a letters of the word "four".

970
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:24,520
But "four" only has 4 letters.

971
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:28,640
In Latin, "quatuor". Remember
the inscription of the mirror?

972
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:30,400
We had to press above
the idol.

973
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:34,160
Not "idolum" as in Latin,
but "eidolon" as in Greek.

974
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:39,320
Meaning "image: or
"reflection". Our own reflection!

975
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:44,600
-This way, master!
-No, this way, Adso.

976
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:34,240
Here... Q and R.

977
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:38,200
Pray God we're
not mistaken.

978
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:50,240
Come.

979
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:17,280
Good evening, Venerable Jorge.

980
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:28,560
I've been expecting you
these several days past, William.

981
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:32,240
You must've flown
to this chamber to reach it ahead of us.

982
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,680
You've discovered many things...

983
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:37,360
since your arrival at
this abbey...

984
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:42,440
but the shortcut through
the labyrinth isn't among them.

985
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:46,360
So now, what's it that you want?

986
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:52,360
I want to see the book
in Greek you said was never written.

987
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:56,640
A book entirely devoted to comedy,
which you hate...

988
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:59,640
as much as you hate laughter.

989
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:05,640
I want to see what's probably
the only the surviving copy...

990
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:09,520
of the 2nd book of the
poetics ofAristotle.

991
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:15,600
William, what a magnificent
librarian you'd have been!

992
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:20,800
Here's your well done
reward.

993
01:48:21,880 --> 01:48:26,520
Read it. Leaf its secrets.

994
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:31,680
You've won.

995
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:41,640
It's close now.

996
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:03,080
"We'll now discuss how comedy
stimulates the liking ridicule..."

997
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:06,200
"by using vulgar persons..."

998
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:08,920
"and taking pleasure from
their defects."

999
01:49:10,640 --> 01:49:15,560
-Carry on, William. Read it!
-Master, we must hurry.

1000
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:17,680
If the light is too deem
for you, give it to the boy...

1001
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:20,560
I'm sure he can read it.

1002
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:25,920
I don't want my pupil
to turn your poisoned pages...

1003
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:30,640
not without the protection
of a glove, such as I'm wearing.

1004
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:38,400
The door! Quick,
before it closes!

1005
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:21,800
Venerable brother, there are many
books that speak of comedy.

1006
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,760
Why does this one
fill you with such fear?

1007
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:27,520
Because it's by Aristotle.

1008
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:28,640
This way.

1009
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:57,600
Do you, Salvatore, renounce
the devil and embrace Jesus Christ...

1010
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:00,920
as your Lord and Savior?

1011
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:11,640
Do you, Remigio de Veragine,
renounce the devil...

1012
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,640
-and embrace Jesus...
-What for?

1013
01:51:13,720 --> 01:51:16,480
It's better die fast
than to spend...

1014
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:18,640
the rest of life in prison.

1015
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:23,720
The devil I renounce
is you, Bernardo Gui.

1016
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,560
Do you renounce the devil
and embrace Jesus as your Savior?

1017
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:41,000
But what's so alarming
about laughter?

1018
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:43,360
Laughter kills fear...

1019
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:46,920
and without fear
there can't be faith.

1020
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
And without fear to the devil...

1021
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:52,960
there's no more need to God.

1022
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:58,360
But you won't eliminate laughter
by eliminating that book.

1023
01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:00,640
No, to be sure.

1024
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:04,280
Laughter will remain
the common man's recreation...

1025
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:07,880
but what'll happen if,
because of this book...

1026
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:11,640
Iearned men work
to pronounce permissible...

1027
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:16,080
to laugh of everything?
Can we laugh at God?

1028
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:19,720
The world would
be back to chaos.

1029
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:25,480
Therefore, I seal that
which is not to be said...

1030
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:30,320
in the tomb I become.

1031
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:36,520
He's there, behind the arch!

1032
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:22,840
Save me!

1033
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:27,480
Look!

1034
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:57,400
Courage, brother!
Remember Dolcino!

1035
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:15,520
Go out! I insist!

1036
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:23,360
Go out! I insist!.

1037
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:28,080
God, save him.

1038
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:40,840
Stay back.

1039
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:44,000
Burn the witch!

1040
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:52,920
Do you dare to raise your
hands to the Church?

1041
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:10,840
You won't leave!

1042
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:15,680
It's all your wrong doing!
My master found out the murderer!

1043
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:45,200
Help me!

1044
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:32,760
Master...

1045
02:01:35,640 --> 02:01:38,360
I never regretted
my decision...

1046
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:42,160
for I learned from my master
what's wise...

1047
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:44,840
and good and true.

1048
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:48,920
When at last we parted,
he presented me with his glasses.

1049
02:01:49,080 --> 02:01:50,920
I was too young, he said...

1050
02:01:51,080 --> 02:01:53,240
but one day they'd
serve me well.

1051
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:58,920
In fact, I'm wearing them now
while I write these lines.

1052
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:04,400
He embraced me like a father...
and sent me on my way.

1053
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:08,120
I never saw him again, and knew
nothing of what have become of him...

1054
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:11,040
but I always prayed that God
received his soul...

1055
02:02:11,240 --> 02:02:14,200
and forgave his little
vanities to which was driven...

1056
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:17,240
by his intellectual pride.

1057
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:22,200
And yet, now that I'm
an old, old man...

1058
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:27,000
I must confess that all the
faces that appeared to me out of the past...

1059
02:02:27,160 --> 02:02:30,920
the one I see most clearly
is that of the girl...

1060
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:33,680
whom I never ceased
to dream...

1061
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:36,960
these many long years.

1062
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:41,160
She was the only earthly
love in my life...

1063
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:46,280
yet I never knew
not ever learned...

1064
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:47,920
her name.

1065
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:54,000
Keep the name first of the rose,
without which we won't exist.
