00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,500
It's raining today.

3
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,800
Don't play in the yard.

4
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,300
There will be plenty of mud.

5
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,700
If you slip, you shall hurt yourself.

6
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,100
- Play inside.
- Okay.

7
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,400
And don't walk under the trees.

8
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,000
A tree fell yesterday

9
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,200
a bridge collapsed,
it was on the news.

10
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,400
But it stopped raining.

11
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,400
It can resume.

12
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,400
Here it is.

13
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,800
Wait!

14
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,000
A minute!

15
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,000
Have you put all the spices?

16
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,600
No Auntie, I forgot one.

17
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,700
I knew it from the first whistle.

18
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,800
Take this.

19
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,800
Thank you, Auntie.

20
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,600
Just a pinch, no more.

21
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay.

22
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,000
This new recipe will work for you.

23
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,100
Are you sure?

24
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,800
You doubt it,

25
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,600
but you'll see.

26
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,500
Yum ... perfect!

27
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,200
A mouthful, and he will build you a Taj Mahal.

28
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,400
The Taj Mahal is a tomb.

29
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,400
I know!

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,200
Retrieves them.

31
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,400
Fernandes.

32
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,900
I present you Shaikh.
Shaikh, Mr Fernandes.

33
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,200
He was chief accountant
in a small Saudi company.

34
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,100
He will take your notes to your departure
in one month.

35
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,200
He has very good references.

36
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,300
Delighted.

37
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,100
Mr. Shroff filled you with praise.

38
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,500
I did come early
to meet you.

39
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,600
Good luck.

40
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,600
Mr. Shroff said for 35 years
you're here.

41
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,500
Your colleagues will miss you.

42
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,400
What does it do?

43
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,400
This is the beginning of your golden age,
how do you feel?

44
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,300
Beautifully.

45
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,800
Awesome!

46
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,200
Can we start training?

47
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,800
Of course.

48
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,200
But it's lunchtime.

49
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,200
Return at 4.45.

50
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Well, anytime.

51
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,900
Thank you!

52
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,900
<i> Today
the recipe for one of my favorite dishes: </ i>

53
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,600
<i> "paneer pyaza do." </ i>

54
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,000
Auntie!

55
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,900
- Are you sleeping?
- What happened?

56
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,000
The lunchbox is back.

57
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,900
And?

58
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,800
It is empty.

59
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,400
Really?

60
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Completely!

61
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,500
It all sauced!

62
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,400
What did I tell you?
And this is just the beginning!

63
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,400
Stop the tape,
Rajeev is back.

64
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,500
Okay.

65
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,400
You're home early, all well?

66
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,500
Did you like your lunch?

67
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,600
It was good.

68
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,200
Well ... nothing else?

69
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,900
As everyday.

70
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,200
The lunchbox was empty,
then I thought ...

71
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,600
Cauliflower was very good.

72
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,700
It was very good.

73
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
I just got back.

74
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,400
I was expecting your call.

75
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,400
It was so boring?

76
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,900
I left early too.

77
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,800
Any problem, sir?

78
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,500
I am retiring in a month.

79
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,800
I would like to stop delivery service.

80
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,800
Okay, I will take note.

81
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,800
I will pay you at the end of the month.

82
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,800
No problem.

83
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,600
And.... who cooked today?

84
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,000
We did, why?

85
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,900
It was good!

86
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
- What?
- It was very good.

87
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,800
Continue like this.

88
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
What happened to him?

89
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,700
Cauliflower did the trick.

90
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,500
Let's do it again tomorrow.

91
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,000
Pass this.

92
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,600
What is this?

93
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,400
Mr. Fernandes, our ball fell inside the balcony
Please can we have it?

94
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,700
Please Sir!

95
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,100
- Do I look like your servant?
- No.

96
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,400
We will not play here.
We'll play on the other side.

97
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,200
If you play in front of this door again
I will chase you down the street.

98
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,900
Please!

99
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,900
We'll play on the other side.

100
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,800
I'm here, Auntie.

101
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,800
You called me just now?

102
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes.

103
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,400
I was changing diapers of Tonton.

104
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,800
What did Rajeev say?

105
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,700
Nothing.

106
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,000
What?

107
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,200
The lunchbox was delivered to someone else.

108
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,900
I don't think Rajeev received it.

109
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,100
Someone else liked it and ate the meal.

110
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,600
No no, impossible.
Delivery guys don't make mistakes.

111
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,500
What happened?

112
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,100
Hello, how are you?

113
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,600
Good morning.

114
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,800
When I returned,
you were not there.

115
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
- You were late.
- I came to 16 h 45 accurate.

116
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,900
I was there, you were late.

117
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,700
No problem.

118
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,300
These are the claims?

119
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,500
It is the claims service here.

120
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
When do we start my training?

121
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,900
Let's go.

122
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,500
Now?

123
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,400
After lunch.

124
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,900
- I'll be back after then?
- Yes, come.

125
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,700
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

126
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,400
You will be right there?

127
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,700
Thank you.

128
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,900
<i>Thank you for emptying the lunchbox yesterday.</ i>

129
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,500
<i>I cooked it for my husband.</ i>

130
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,400
<i>Seeing the empty box, </ i>

131
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,500
<i> I thought he would tell me
something about it. </ i>

132
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,000
<i> I thought, for few hours </ i>

133
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,100
<i> that to seduce the heart,
stomach must be satisfied first.</ i>

134
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,800
<i>In return for those hours</ i>

135
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,300
<i> today I'm sending you paneer. </ i>

136
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,300
<i>Favorite dish of my husband.
Ila. </ i>

137
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,800
Auntie, isn't it weird to write this?

138
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,400
Ila, you should thank him.

139
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,900
And what if Rajeev gets it?

140
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,300
That's even better.

141
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,900
He ate someone else's food and
he didn't even notice.

142
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,100
He would know today.

143
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,700
Should I write anything else?

144
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,100
No, keep it short!

145
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,600
Auntie, are you asleep?

146
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,700
What?

147
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,300
The lunchbox is back.

148
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Empty, but With a reply to the letter.

149
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,500
- A reply?
- Yes.

150
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,100
Read it to me.

151
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,400
This is not Rajeev's handwriting.

152
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,100
And what does it say?

153
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,200
"Dear Ila. Food
was very salty today. "

154
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
And what else?

155
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,100
"Dear Ila. Food
was very salty today. "

156
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,400
What? No "thank you", nothing else?

157
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,300
"Dear Ila. Food
was very salty today. "

158
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,400
What kind of moron eats food for free
and then complains about it?

159
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,000
Hold on a minute.

160
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,300
Here, put these in.

161
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,800
No, all this doesn't seem right to me.

162
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,300
I will talk to the driver
about this wrong delivery.

163
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,900
No, he should've thanked you.

164
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,800
No no, I really don't like it.

165
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,900
Why? He's not anyone you know,
why do you care?

166
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,600
Good morning. How are you?

167
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,300
Good.

168
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,600
You were not at your desk,
so I came here.

169
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,700
You were reading in the canteen,
I didn't want to bother you.

170
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,200
Your meal exhales a delicious aroma.

171
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,400
I tasted the food
just by smelling it!

172
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,600
Your wife ...

173
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,600
has magic in her hands.

174
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,900
My wife is dead.

175
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,200
<i> Dear Ila,
the salt was fine today. </ i>

176
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,900
<i> The chilly was a bit on a higher side.</ i>

177
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,400
<i> but I had two bananas after lunch,
they help to extinguish the fire in my mouth. </ i>

178
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,100
<i> And I think it also will be
good for the motions. </ i>

179
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,100
<i> So many people in the city</ i>

180
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,100
<i> eat only a banana or two for lunch. </ i>

181
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,200
<i> It's cheap and it fills you. </ i>

182
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,300
<i> Hello. </ i>

183
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,900
<i> My husband came home late last night. </ i>

184
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,600
<i> He did not say a word. </ i>

185
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,500
<i> This morning, he went to work,
and my daughter to school. </ i>

186
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:05,400
<i> And I cooked with Auntie Deshpande. </ i>

187
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,300
<i> Auntie Deshpande is our upstairs neighbor. </ i>

188
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,800
Her husband is in a  <i>
coma for the past 15 years. </ i>

189
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,100
<i> One day he woke up
and began to stare at the fan. </ i>

190
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,300
<i> From that day he doesn't
see anything else.  </ i>

191
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,300
<i> He only looks up to the fan
and falls asleep at night. </ i>

192
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,900
<i> Upon awakening, he goes back staring at it. </ i>

193
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,500
<i> He says nothing. </ i>

194
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,100
<i> For 15 years. </ i>

195
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,100
<i> Even doctors have lost all hope. </ i>

196
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,300
<i> It's an old model Orient fan. </ i>

197
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,000
<i> It never stops. </ i>

198
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,700
<i> Auntie thinks, it keeps him alive. </ i>

199
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,900
<i> One day, there was
a power outage. </ i>

200
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,400
<i> The fan stopped
and his pulse slowed. </ i>

201
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,700
<i> Fortunately, the electricity came back. </ i>

202
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,900
<i> since Auntie installed a generator. </ i>

203
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,500
Her husband continues <i>
to stare at the fan. </ i>

204
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,300
<i>and mine stuck with his phone. </ i>

205
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,900
<i> as if nothing else exists. </ i>

206
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,500
<i> This might be true,
there is really nothing else. </ i>

207
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,500
What do we live for?

208
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,800
<i> Dear Ila,
Your husband sounds like a busy man. </ I>

209
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,800
<i> Life is very busy these days. </ i>

210
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,200
<i> There are too many people, </ i>

211
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,700
<i> and everyone wants
what the other has. </ i>

212
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,200
<i> Years ago, you could find a place
to sit in the train every now and then, </ i>

213
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,200
<i> but these days, it's difficult. </ i>

214
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,600
<i> If Mr. Deshpande wakes up now, </ i>

215
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,500
<i> he will see the difference and probably
go back to his ceiling fan. </ i>

216
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,000
<i> When my wife died,
she got a horizontal burial cot. </ i>

217
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,500
<i> I tried to buy a burial cot for
myself the other day, </ i>

218
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,100
<i> and what they offered me was a vertical one. </ i>

219
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,300
<i> I've spent my whole life standing in trains and buses, </ i>

220
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,100
<i> now I'll even have to stand when I'm dead! . </ i>

221
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,100
<i> Why don't you
have another child? </ i>

222
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,700
<i> Sometimes having a child
can help a marriage. </ i>

223
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,500
Rajeev?

224
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,600
What do you say?

225
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,300
It's pretty.

226
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,400
You forgot?

227
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,600
Rajeev, I wore it
on our honeymoon.

228
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,500
Today I thought to try it,
if it needed alterations.

229
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,900
But it suits me very well,

230
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,300
- Right?
- Yes.

231
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,000
It is a little wide.

232
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,300
Yes ...

233
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,500
On our honeymoon, we didn't know
Yashvi will born.

234
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,000
We didn't know for a while.

235
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,300
Two months!

236
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,100
We didn't have much
at the time.

237
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,600
When she was born,
luck smiled on us.

238
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,600
Everything is so expensive today,
luck isn't enough.

239
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,700
Why do you send me
cauliflower every day?

240
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,500
Have you bought a stock?

241
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,700
Rajeev.

242
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,900
And what if Yashvi had a
little brother or sister?

243
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,700
You had one.

244
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,300
And ...

245
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,900
Don't send me cauliflower everyday,
it gives me gas.

246
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:32,000
Cars, buses, airplanes:

247
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,600
all trapped in Mumbai we are.

248
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,700
This road is jam
since this morning.

249
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,800
You see that tower?

250
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,800
A woman jumped from there this morning
with her little girl.

251
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,000
She jumped with her daughter?

252
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,200
What was her name?

253
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,700
I don't know.
I don't know.

254
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,200
Surely some domestic problems.

255
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,700
You know someone
who lives there?

256
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,500
Did she survive?

257
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,900
<i> Hello. </ i>

258
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,600
<i> this morning
my husband went to the office ... </ i>

259
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,200
Hello, sir.
How are you?

260
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,600
I'm busy.

261
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,700
And my training?

262
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,000
It's lunchtime.
Check back later.

263
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,000
I was told to expect nothing
from you.

264
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,900
I'm Aslam Shaikh.
I'm an orphan.

265
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,500
I gave myself that name.

266
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,900
All I know
I taught myself.

267
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,700
And I will also learn this myself.
I'm done. Thank you very much.

268
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,800
Listen.

269
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,300
Come here.

270
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,600
Go to my desk.

271
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,700
There are claims files
of Ahmedabad sector.

272
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,100
Calculate the amounts

273
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,600
and send it to accounts department.

274
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,000
Thank you very much.

275
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,200
Thank you very much.

276
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,300
I'll be right back.

277
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,700
No, don't come back, go to work.

278
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,700
Yes sir, thank you very much.

279
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,700
<i> This morning my husband went to the office
and Yashvi school. </ i>

280
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,000
<i> I listened to the news on the radio. </ i>

281
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,600
<i>At the death of my brother,
everyone said: </ i>

282
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,800
<i> he should've been brave. </ i>

283
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,500
<i> He failed his exams, so what? </ i>

284
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,700
<i> He should've been brave. </ i>

285
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,800
<i> What this woman might've thought? </ i>

286
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,700
<i> Maybe she removed her jewelry at night... </ i>

287
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
<i> Bracelets, earrings, </ i>

288
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,000
<i> wedding necklace ... </ i>

289
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,500
<i> What her daughter might've asked? </ i>

290
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,400
Mom?

291
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,600
<i> It must have been difficult
reaching to the roof. </ i>

292
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,200
<i> It takes a lot of courage to jump? </ i>

293
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,500
<i> Dear Ila, please don't
say it like that. </ i>

294
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,500
<i> Things are never as bad as they seem. </ i>

295
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,800
<i> One day I was on the train
on my way to work, </ i>

296
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,200
<i> And then suddenly I felt something. </ i>

297
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,900
<i> Someone touching me ... </ i>

298
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,900
<i> down there... </ i>

299
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,300
Are you laughing?

300
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,900
Yes, Auntie.

301
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,900
I thought of a joke.

302
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,700
Tell!

303
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,000
I forgot.

304
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,700
- You forgot?
- Yes.

305
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,600
Soak five almonds every night.

306
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,800
And eat them in the morning.

307
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,500
It strengthens memory.

308
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,300
Noted.

309
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,300
How are you?

310
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,600
- Are you going to the station?
- Yes.

311
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,800
I get off at Central Station
Bombay.

312
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,300
I live in Dongri.

313
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,400
And you?

314
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,700
At Bandra.

315
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,200
If you don't mind
can I ask you a question?

316
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,000
Yes.

317
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,700
At the office, people said that ...

318
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,700
you kicked a cat while walking.

319
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,400
The cat went under a bus, and you kept
walking. Didn't even look back.

320
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
Is that true?

321
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,900
It wasn't a cat.
It was actualy a blind man.

322
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,300
He was asking me directions,

323
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,300
so I pushed him under a bus.

324
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,100
So... you better be careful.

325
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,600
Thank you.

326
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,400
Give me a cigarette.

327
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,000
I'll pay later.

328
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,600
That was a joke, right?

329
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,100
Have you always lived in Bandra?

330
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,600
Yes, always.

331
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,300
I moved constantly.

332
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,600
At first, I was at Muhammad Ali Road.

333
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,000
Then I went to Dubai,
then in Saudi.

334
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,300
I was traveled between Saudi and
here many times in between.

335
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,200
But after meeting Meherunissa,
I stayed.

336
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,800
I cut vegetables here

337
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
and I cook when I get home.

338
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
Where did you learn to do that?

339
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,200
I used to work in a hotel in saudi.

340
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,100
In a hotel?

341
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,800
Kitchen, room service,
accounting ...

342
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,800
All in one.

343
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
It's boring there.

344
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,500
No entertainment,
work--prayer, prayer--work ...

345
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,000
Here I have free time.

346
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:58,200
I cook for Meherunissa,
we eat when she gets home.

347
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,700
- And then we sometimes go for a walk.
- Very well.

348
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,600
I love her more than anything.

349
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,700
What do you do in evening?

350
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:18,400
I watch TV sometimes.

351
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,900
Why don't you come with me?

352
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,400
- Where?
- My house.

353
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,900
I will make you a "Pasanda".

354
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,200
- A what?
- "Pasanda".

355
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,700
- What is it?
- A dish made with lamb.

356
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,900
You cut it like that.

357
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,000
- From the lamb?
- Yes.

358
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,200
My specialty.

359
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,800
I will come.

360
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,500
- Now.
- Right now?

361
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,800
Yes, please!

362
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:59,800
No, I have work, another time.

363
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,400
Next time, promise?

364
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,000
I will be waiting.

365
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,400
Next time.

366
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
- See you soon.
- Goodbye.

367
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,600
<i> Hello.
My husband came home late yesterday. </ I>

368
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,200
<i> He returned to work
after a call. </ i>

369
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,100
<i> Yashvi went to sleep as well. </ i>

370
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,800
<i> After my marriage, I brought some things
from home without letting mother know. </ i>

371
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,200
<i> I found an old diary. </ i>

372
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,000
<i> It contains recipes
by my grandmother. </ i>

373
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,000
<i> I found one. </ i>

374
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,500
<i> It's the right season. </ i>

375
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,000
<i> I think you'll like it. </ i>

376
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,700
Excellent!

377
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,500
How are you?

378
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,400
Can I sit?

379
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,300
Please.

380
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,600
Thank you.

381
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,200
Want a taste?

382
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,200
Are you sure?

383
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,100
Yes.

384
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:06,900
What happened?

385
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,700
Where do you get this meal?

386
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,600
From a restaurant near my home.

387
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,700
Why?

388
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,000
It is delicious.

389
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,900
Book a meal for me.

390
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,200
They will close down soon.

391
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,000
With food so delicious?

392
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,900
There is no value for talent
in this country.

393
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,400
You are right, sir.

394
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,500
It must be magic
in hands.

395
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,200
Everyone can cook,
but there must be magic.

396
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,300
<i> Dear Ila,
your grandmother's recipe was very good. </ i>

397
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,500
<i> Even better than my favorite dish,
eggplant. </ i>

398
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,700
<i> Yesterday, I also
found something. </ i>

399
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,400
<i> old emissions
my wife recorded. </ i>

400
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,100
You probably were <i>
not yet born at the time. </ i>

401
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,100
<i> My wife loved them. </ i>

402
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,200
<i> I wanted to watch,
who knows why. </ i>

403
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,700
<i> I have watched for hours. </ i>

404
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,200
<i> Episode after episode. </ i>

405
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,600
<i> After spending the night </ i>

406
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,600
<i> I understood what I was looking for. </ i>

407
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,000
<i> Every Sunday
while she watched, </ i>

408
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,500
<i> I stood outside,
fix my bike or smoke. </ i>

409
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,500
<i> I threw him a glance
from time to time. </ i>

410
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,600
<i> And I saw his reflection on the screen, </ i>

411
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,900
<i> still laughing at the jokes ... </ i>

412
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,800
<i> she knew by heart. </ i>

413
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,900
<i> If only I had continued
to look at the time ... </ i>

414
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,500
I forwarded
all payment orders.

415
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,200
An apple and a banana for you.

416
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,600
Go ahead.

417
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,000
No, sir.

418
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:38,900
I insist.

419
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,000
Okay.

420
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,300
What is that?

421
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
A leaf.

422
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,400
Can I have some water,
please?

423
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,600
Then, right?

424
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,200
I love it.

425
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,000
Thank you.

426
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,800
Today, we no longer send
letters. As emails.

427
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,400
More letters?

428
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,600
This is the era of emails.

429
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,900
<i> Hello. </ i>

430
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:37,000
My mother loves <i>
old serials. </ i>

431
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,600
Small <i>, I watched
for hours. </ i>

432
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,400
<i> I wanted to tell you something. </ i>

433
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,800
<i> Each cigarette smoke,
it is 5 min of life and less. </ i>

434
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,900
<i> My father has lung cancer. </ i>

435
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:54,400
<i> When he suffers too,
he said he would have to smoke more </ i>

436
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,900
<i> for not
to deal with this pain. </ i>

437
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,200
<i> don't blame me. </ i>

438
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,100
Yes, Auntie?

439
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,100
You have my carrots?

440
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,500
They are there.

441
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,700
Here!

442
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,200
They cost only 10 rupees.

443
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,200
What have you taken other?

444
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,800
As usual.

445
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,900
<i> What other food can you cook
based eggplant? </ i>

446
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:18,200
<i> can fry them, stuff them,
bake ... </ i>

447
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,900
It follows a new treatment.

448
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,100
It helps,
but he sleeps all day.

449
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,100
Mom? Where's the TV?

450
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,300
There are currently more good emissions
nowadays.

451
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,800
You need money?

452
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,000
It comes out.

453
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,900
This treatment is very expensive.

454
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:53,400
It's OK, I got it.

455
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,000
But how?
Where do you find the money?

456
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:05,800
If my son was there,
I would not have to beg.

457
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,800
I'll talk to Rajeev.

458
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,400
It's no go.

459
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,100
I ask 5000.

460
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,000
It is the family of the bride.

461
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,200
What was the air
to ask all this money?

462
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:31,200
You can pay little by little.

463
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,500
No.

464
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,700
I have money.

465
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,500
I got it.

466
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,100
Well, okay.

467
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,800
But don't tell your father.

468
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,100
The 5000 should be sufficient

469
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,300
for this month.

470
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,500
Next month
else be found.

471
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,700
You wanna see it?

472
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:11,300
I wake up?

473
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,200
It's late, we must go back.

474
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,400
Okay.

475
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,500
<i> Dear Ila, </ i>

476
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,100
You will not believe <i>

<i> the evening, on my way to the station

480

481

<i> But if you look closer, </ i>

482
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,600
<i> we note that each

483
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,200

484
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
<i> Or a dog crossing the street. </ i>

485
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,800
<i> What caught the attention of the painter. </ i>

486
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,900
<i> And on one of them, </ i>

487

<i> I saw. </ i>

488
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,400
<i> At least I think that's me. </ i>

489
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,300
<i> Then I offered

<i> But some things have remained. </ i>

494
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,100
<i> old post, </ i>

495
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,400
<i> and the hospital where I was born </ i>

496
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,700

497
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,800
<i> I think we forget things
if there is nobody to tell them. </ i>

498
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,700
Pardon, sir?

499
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,100
- What?
- You told me?

500
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:27,800
No.

501
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,700
What do you play?

502
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,600
In Blind Man's Bluff.

503
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,300
- You know what I was playing at your age?
- What?

504
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,400
Let's remove it first.

505
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,100
I do?

506
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,400
I got it.

507
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,600
We played at home.

508
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,800
That was the baby.

509
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,900
I was the father.

510
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:22,100
And your uncle was the mother, wife.

511
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,100
<i> Hello. </ i>

512
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,700
<i> I want to tell you something. </ i>

513
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,100
<i> I think my husband is having an affair. </ i>

514
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,100
At first I thought <i> confront. </ i>

515
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,500
<i> But I have not had the courage. </ i>

516
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,500
<i> Where would I go? </ i>

517
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,100
<i> There is one place ... </ i>

518
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,400
<i> My daughter has learned in Bhutan,
everyone is happy. </ i>

519
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:38,700
They don't have <i> GNP
but Gross National Happiness. </ i>

520
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,100
<i> Would not it be wonderful
to have it here? </ i>

521
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,300
Madame.

522
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,700
<i> if I came to Bhutan with you? </ i>

523
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,300
You seem distracted.

524
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,500
- I made a mistake?
- No.

525
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,500
Tell me, Shaikh ...

526
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,100
Yes?

527
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,800
- Have you ever been to Bhutan?
- Bhutan?

528
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:26,800
I thought ... rather than Nasik,
I could move there.

529
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,800
I have been in Saudi Arabia.
Bhutan, that's fine too.

530
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,800
It has advantages:
1 rupee is 5 there.

531
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,500
It's worth going there.

532
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:45,500
My mother said ... she always says:

533
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,300
"The wrong train
can take you to the right station. "

534
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,100
Your mother?

535
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,500
You told me that you were an orphan.

536
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,100
This is true,

537
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,600
but when I say:
"My mother always says ..."

538
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:07,100
people take me seriously.
It feels good.

539
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:15,600
That is correct.

540
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,300
You're listening to Radio <i> Bhutan ... </ i>

541
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,700
<i> How could we go together
Bhutan? </ i>

542
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
<i> I don't even know your name. </ i>

543
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,300
How are you?

544
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:32,600
A banana and an apple.

545
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,400
Try this.

546
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,500
You are radiant today.

547
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,600
Whether he comes?

548
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,700
You lost 10 years.

549
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:05,900
Your mother said that the wrong train
can take you to the right station ...

550
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,700
- My mother is always right.
- So?

551
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,600
I love it.

552
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,600
Variety.

553
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,100
Variety, sir.

554
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,900
Auntie!

555
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,100
What does he?

556
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,400
Would you have the cassette of this film,
"Saajan"?

557
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,100
So, why?

558
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,700
The songs were good, right?

559
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,100
Not bad.

560
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,300
We can hear it?

561
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,300
Now?

562
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:01,900
Yes.

563
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,100
You can put it?

564
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,800
I put it.

565
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,500
<i> Hello, </ i>

566
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:19,100

567
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,800

572
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:43,200

576
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,400
It seems they are <i>
a very good "kheema pao", </ i>

577
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,300
<i> my favorite dish. </ i>

578

579
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,300
Mr. Saajan ...

580
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,000
What?

581
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,800
The boss wants to see you.

582
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:09,700
- Yes, I will go after lunch.
- This is urgent.

583
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,400
I'm coming.

584
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:29,500
Can I enter?

585
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,200
I just had a meeting
with accounting.

586
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:53,600
I've never been
so embarrassed in my life.

587
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,800
Do you know what they said?

588
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:02,300
It is as if our service
claims did not exist.

589
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:07,000
All payment orders are wrong!

590
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,100
Shaikh initials are everywhere.

591
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,200
The idea that I would leave
replace you!

592
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,100
Should you review all of this.

593
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:23,400
Spend the night if necessary,
but correct me that.

594
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,200
In your case, Shaikh,
out of my sight.

595
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,100
It's my fault, sir.

596
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,600
It is I who
payment orders.

597
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,900
He has initialed
because we work together.

598
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:38,200
It's my fault.

599
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,800
Fernandes,
you don't have to defend it.

600
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,800
I am not defending anyone, sir.

601
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,600
35 years of service,

602
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,300
and you have never done
the slightest mistake.

603
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,100
It's not my type
defend anyone.

604
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,100
Anyway,

605
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,000
I take care of the accounting.

606
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,100
Okay, sir.

607
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,800
One last thing.

608
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:13,200
Why these files
they have the smell of vegetables?

609
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,800
Onions, potatoes, even garlic!

610
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:18,900
Really?

611
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,000
Feel!

612
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:24,800
I don't know.

613
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,600
Pardon, sir.

614
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:53,800
Thank you.
You saved me.

615
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:57,600
don't cut ever
those pesky vegetables on folders.

616
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:00,000
Forgiveness.

617
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,600
I put a plastic bag,
next time.

618
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Okay, no vegetables. Nothing. Forgiveness.

619
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,000
This is not the accounts
a shabby little restaurant!

620
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:21,300
These public accounts!

621
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:29,500
If you don't do that, go!

622
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,600
From?

623
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:32,900
No.

624
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,800
You teach me everything.

625
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:39,400
I'm sorry,
but you teach me everything.

626
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:46,500
Your mother told you
to make fake degrees

627
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:48,300
to get a job?

628
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,400
It must have been mistaken ...

629
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,500
What kind of person are you?

630
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,800
And if you come home for lunch?

631
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,300
I prepared a "Pasanda".

632
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,800
Amazing! Mr. Shaikh.

633
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,300
Amazing ...

634
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,200
A "Pasanda" he said.

635
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,300
You come from, is not it?

636
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:41,500
- Take--in.
- No.

637
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:44,400
This is very good.

638
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,200
This is my recipe.

639
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,700
My father warned me:

640
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:50,500
"don't marry this guy,
it will chain you to the stove. "

641
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,900
His father is a very dangerous man.

642
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:57,900
He did not smile
since the World Cup 1984.

643
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,600
Or maybe just a little.

644
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,800
Still grinning.

645
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,400
What does your wife?

646
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,000
Shh.

647
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,300
I'm sorry, she did not know.

648
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,000
Okay.

649
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:21,800
My wife is dead.

650
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:33,800
But I have a girlfriend.

651
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,200
You?

652
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:39,700
Yes.

653
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,400
How is it called?

654
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,600
Ila.

655
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:09,400
I knew it!
Meals, notes ...

656
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,500
When were you married?

657
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:16,200
Marriage ... it sometimes seems
it's been 35 years.

658
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Or 25 or 10, but I sometimes
feel like it was yesterday.

659
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,600
You back for seconds.

660
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:30,100
This is my recipe.

661
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,100
You don't eat anything at all.

662
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:40,200
I wanted to ask you something.

663
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:42,000
Go ahead.

664
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:47,400
About our marriage ...

665
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:53,700
In fact, his father refused.

666
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,700
He said: "He is an orphan, small,
he skinned. "

667
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:07,000
Meherunissa then fled.

668
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:15,000
But she wants the blessing
his father.

669
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,700
I will not tell anyone.

670
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,600
No, that's not it.

671
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:23,000
He agreed.

672
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,000
We're getting married.

673
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:37,600
There will be a whole army on his side:
brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts ...

674
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:42,000
everyone will be there.

675
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:45,600
But there will be no one on my side.

676
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:49,400
I am alone.

677
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,700
I wanted to know if you would ...

678
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:58,900
to be my witness.

679
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:01,400
Me?

680
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:04,500
Yes. And if Ms. Ila could come too.

681
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:10,300
Course.

682
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,000
We will come.

683
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,700
His father wants to offer me a scooter.

684
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,000
A gift for my promotion.

685
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,600
But I'm not leaving.

686
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:31,400
I thought refuse
early departure retirement.

687
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:37,200
I ask the boss
you become my assistant.

688
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,000
So your promotion ...

689
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:46,600
This is very good news,
Sir!

690
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:53,200
But not a word to my father,
otherwise no scooter.

691
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,700
I'll tell Meherunissa.

692
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,200
Sir, you want to sit?

693
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,400
Me?

694
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,600
Yes, take my place.

695
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:35,800
No.

696
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:39,000
Please.
I go down to the next.

697
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:07,700
- Fernandes.
- Yes?

698
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:09,400
You wanted to talk to me?

699
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,400
No.

700
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,100
My secretary told me ...

701
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:17,000
It was about payment orders.

702
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,300
What is it?

703
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,500
This is resolved.

704
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:23,500
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

705
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,800
Okay. See you later.

706
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,700
Want to Buy?

707
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:44,400
<i> Dear Ila, </ i>

708
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:47,600
<i> I got the lunchbox today
but it was empty. </ i>

709
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:50,200
<i> It was deserved. </ i>

710
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,500
<i> Yesterday you me long
waited at the restaurant ... </ i>

711
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:58,800
<i> But before that, in the morning, </ i>

712
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,200
<i> I forgot something
in the bathroom. </ i>

713
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,000
<i> I went back ... </ i>

714
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,200
<i> and the room had the same smell </ i>

715
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,400
<i> that my grandfather left there </ i>

716
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:12,300
<i> after his shower. </ i>

717
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:17,200
<i> It was like he had been there. </ i>

718
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:19,800
<i> But that was not the case. </ i>

719
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:21,500
<i> That was me. </ i>

720
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:25,200
<i> Me and the smell of an old man. </ i>

721
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,300
<i> I don't know
when I became old. </ i>

722
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:34,300
<i> It was perhaps this morning.
Or before. </ I>

723
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,200
<i> And maybe if I'd forgotten
something earlier, </ i>

724
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,300
<i> I would then noticed. </ i>

725
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,200
Sir, you want to sit?

726
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:44,800
No.

727
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:51,000
<i> life rocked me languidly, </ i>

728
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:55,100
<i> forward, back ... </ i>

729
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
<i> And before I knew it ... </ i>

730
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:02,400
<i> Nobody buys
a lottery ticket expired, Ila. </ i>

731
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,100
<i> I came to the restaurant. </ i>

732
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:09,700
<i> And you were there, </ i>

733
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:11,700
<i> fiddling with your purse, </ i>

734
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,000
<i> to drink all that water ... </ i>

735
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:24,700
I wanted to come <i>
tell you all this in the face, </ i>

736
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,000
<i> but I only look at you. </ i>

737
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,100
<i> You were lovely. </ i>

738
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,900
<i> You are young. </ i>

739
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,300
<i> You still have dreams. </ i>

740
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:45,100
<i> You have greeted me some time. </ i>

741
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,000
<i> And I want to thank you. </ i>

742
01:22:30,700 --> 01:22:34,300
The two ladies behind
come forward, please.

743
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,000
Smile, please.

744
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,400
One, two, three.

745
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:43,800
Now a photo
with everyone!

746
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
The family of the bride to the right.
The spouse left.

747
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,500
The spouse left.

748
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,000
You leave, sir?

749
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:21,900
- This is the new scooter?
- I will drop you somewhere?

750
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:27,000
If you stay,
I will go to my father.

751
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:30,900
Taxi!

752
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:36,800
It's weird, it is very dry ...

753
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:49,900
Goodbye, Shaikh.

754
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,800
You know,

755
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,800
when I took the train for the 1st time
with you, 1st class.

756
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:03,400
That day, I had no ticket.

757
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,600
I was anxious throughout the journey.

758
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,100
I prayed that the controller
does not come.

759
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:12,000
What would you think of me?

760
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:19,900
The next day, I got to
a 1st class pass.

761
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,300
You make a good husband, Shaikh.

762
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:39,300
Thank you.

763
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,000
A moment.

764
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,500
Come see me at Nasik, on occasion.

765
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,100
I'm coming, Mom.

766
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,000
80 rupees.

767
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,700
Rajeev comes.

768
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,500
It is in a meeting.

769
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,200
It will go directly to the crematorium.

770
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,900
I have one of these hungers.

771
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,000
A desire to "parathas".

772
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,700
I have not eaten this morning.

773
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,100
I prepared his breakfast it.

774
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:08,400
Mom ...

775
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,900
I always apprehended

776
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,500
what would happen to me after his death.

777
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,500
- don't worry.
- But now ...

778
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,100
I'm hungry, that's all.

779
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:40,800
It was loved at first

780
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:43,800
when you were born.

781
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:52,600
But for years,
it disgusted me.

782
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:59,000
Every morning, I prepared something to eat.

783
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,500
Drugs. Bath.

784
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:04,000
Breakfast. Drugs.

785
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:05,500
Bath.

786
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,800
When your brother is dead,

787
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:23,000
this old ambulance came.

788
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:24,900
Do you remember?

789
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,500
These old Matador models.

790
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,600
Which came today?

791
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,600
What color?

792
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,200
White with blue light.

793
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,000
Yes.

794
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,700
Sir.

795
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,600
The lunchbox comes
to the wrong address.

796
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,600
It is impossible.

797
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:16,600
- We never make mistakes.
- Yes, I understand.

798
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:22,200
But my meals are poorly delivered.

799
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,300
- It is delivered to the right address.
- I tell you no.

800
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:26,100
People came to Harvard.

801
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:27,500
Listen to what I tell you.

802
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,500
Try to understand.

803
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:34,800
This lunchbox is not delivered to my husband.

804
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,500
It comes also
it is someone else who receives it.

805
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,300
People Harvard
came to study our system.

806
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,800
They say that there is no error.

807
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,500
But it's not going to the right place.

808
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,300
You think I'm a liar?

809
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:52,100
The King of England in person
came to observe our system.

810
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,100
But this meal goes somewhere
someone eats it.

811
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:56,600
He goes to the right place.

812
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,600
I want the address!

813
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:25,800
Office Saajan Fernandes?

814
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,800
Two rows away.

815
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:42,300
Is the office Saajan Fernandes?

816
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:45,100
I remember you.

817
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:47,000
Saajan Fernandes?

818
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,700
He is gone.

819
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:52,200
He left the company.

820
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:54,200
Where can I find it?

821
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:58,300
He went to Nasik.

822
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:09,300
Then you go to Nasik?

823
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:10,500
Yes.

824
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:14,400
You move?

825
01:31:16,300 --> 01:31:17,500
Yes.

826
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,800
This is final?

827
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:22,500
Yes.

828
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:29,300
I'm retired there for years.

829
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:32,200
I return to Mumbai from time to time
to see my son.

830
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:12,400
I'm sorry, Mrs. Ila.

831
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:58,700
Good evening, Mr. Fernandes.

832
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:00,300
We thought you were gone.

833
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:03,000
Yes, but I came back.

834
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,200
Why?

835
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:15,500
Well, you can play here.

836
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:18,500
But don't break windows,
understood?

837
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:20,300
Hold.

838
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,300
Thank you, Mr. Fernandes.

839
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,500
I've been calling you all the time.

840
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,000
Where were you?

841
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:56,200
I had to adjust something.

842
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,500
I got worried.

843
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:03,700
I have more layers to Tonton.

844
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,400
I asked the guard to search.

845
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,200
I washed the fan today.

846
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,500
While he was running!

847
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,300
<i> You're probably Nasik. </ i>

848
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:07,800
<i> You had to get up this morning
make a tea. </ i>

849
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,100
<i> And maybe a walk then. </ i>

850
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:18,300
<i> This morning I woke up,
and I sold all my jewelry. </ i>

851
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:22,800
<i> My bracelets, my earrings,
my wedding necklace. </ i>

852
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,800
<i> It is not much. </ i>

853
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,100
<i> But they told me:
1 rupee is worth 5 in Bhutan. </ I>

854
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,800
So we should <i>
get away for some time. </ i>

855
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,400
<i> And more ... </ i>

856
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,300
<i> we'll see. </ i>

857
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:41,900
<i> return Yashvi,
luggage will be ready. </ i>

858
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:44,200
<i> We take the train this afternoon. </ i>

859
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:47,600
<i> I may send you this letter </ i>

860
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:50,300
<i> and your new factor
you bring. </ i>

861
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,500
<i> Or maybe I should keep it, </ i>

862
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,800
<i> and read in a few years ... </ i>

863
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,000
<i> I read somewhere that sometimes, </ i>

864
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:04,200
<i> the wrong train
can lead you to the right station. </ i>

865
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,100
<i> We'll see ... </ i>

866
