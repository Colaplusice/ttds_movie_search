1
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,710
Shit!

2
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,610
If you pair of deuces
lookin for work

3
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,380
I suggest you get your
scrawny asses in here, pronto

4
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,730
Now, up on Brokeback...

5
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,900
the Forest Service has
got designated campsites...

6
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:49,535
on the allotments

7
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,140
Them camps can be 3 or 4 miles
from where we pasture the woollies

8
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,740
Bad predator loss, if there's
nobody lookin after em at night

9
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,740
Now, what I want...

10
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,700
is... a camp tender

11
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,750
to stay at the main camp
where the Forest Service says

12
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:10,210
But the herder... hes gonna pitch
a pup tent on the Q.T. with the sheep

13
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,760
and hes gonna sleep there

14
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,760
You eat your supper
and breakfast at camp...

15
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,760
but you sleep with the sheep

16
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,760
A hundred percent

17
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,770
No fire... Dont leave no sign...

18
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,350
You roll up that tent every morning

19
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,690
in case Forest Service snoops around

20
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,730
Yeah?

21
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,690
No

22
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,740
No!

23
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,600
Not on your fuckin life!

24
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,660
You got your dogs, your
30-30. You sleep there

25
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,300
Last summer I had a goddam near
25% loss. I dont want that again

26
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,960
You...

27
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,800
fridays at noon, be
down at the bridge...

28
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,800
with a grocery list and mules...

29
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,810
and somebody with supplies...

30
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,010
will be there at the pick-up

31
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,630
Tomorrow morning well
truck you up to the jump off

32
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,840
Jack Twist

33
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,850
Ennis

34
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,150
Your folks just stop at Ennis?

35
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,310
Del Mar

36
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,970
Nice to know you, Ennis Del Mar

37
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,280
My second year up here

38
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,880
Last year, one storm, the
lightning killed 42 sheep

39
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,880
Thought Id asphyxiate
from the smell

40
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,190
Aguirre got all over my ass, like I
was supposed to control the weather

41
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,890
But... beats working for my old man

42
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,890
Cant please my old man, no way...

43
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,900
Thats why I took the rodeo

44
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,600
You ever rodeo?

45
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,900
You know... well...
I mean once in a while

46
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,600
When I got the entry
fee in my pocket

47
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,070
Yeah

48
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,910
Are you from ranch people?

49
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,870
Yeah, I was...

50
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,620
Your folks run you off?

51
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,920
No, they run themselves off

52
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,920
There was, uh, one curve
in the road in 43 miles...

53
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,620
and they missed it

54
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,930
So, uh...

55
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,900
the bank took the ranch...

56
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,650
...and my brother and sister,
they raised me mostly

57
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,630
Shit!

58
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,300
Thats hard...

59
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,300
Can I?

60
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,900
Thank you

61
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:42,970
Only thing...

62
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,970
dont ever order soup

63
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,470
Them soup boxes are hard to pack

64
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,790
I dont eat soup

65
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,980
Well, watch it there

66
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,580
That horse has a low startle point

67
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,990
Doubt there's a filly
that could throw me

68
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,710
Let's git, unless you wanna
sit around tyin' knots all day

69
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,660
Oh, shit...

70
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:52,530
Cant wait till I get my own spread

71
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,480
and I wont have to put up
with Joe Aguirres crap no more

72
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,870
Im savin for a place myself

73
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,590
Alma and me, we're gonna get married
when I come down off this mountain

74
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,070
Shit... That stay with the sheep...

75
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,170
no fire bullshit...

76
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,300
Aguirre got no right makin us
do somethin' against the rules

77
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,510
No more beans

78
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,510
Damm... Shit!

79
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,860
I don't know...

80
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,670
Something wrong?

81
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,275
Yeah, so what...

82
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,880
Why didnt we get the
powdered milk and the spuds?

83
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,600
Its all we got

84
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,990
Well, heres next weeks

85
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,780
Thought you didnt eat soup

86
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,990
Yeah, well, Im sick of beans

87
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,010
Too early in the summer
to be sick of beans

88
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,660
Come on

89
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,960
Come on... Come on...

90
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,490
Whoa there, whoa, whoa!

91
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,190
Shit!

92
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,590
Whoa! Come back, here!

93
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,080
Whoa there, whoa

94
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:39,040
All right. Fuck it!

95
00:15:39,075 --> 00:15:40,990
Okay, you bastard...

96
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,890
Where the hell you been?

97
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,165
Been up with the sheep all day

98
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,310
I get down here hungry as
hell... and all I find is beans

99
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,200
What in the hell happened, Ennis?

100
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,510
I come on a bear,
is what happened...

101
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,520
Goddam horse spooked

102
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,410
and the mules took off and
scattered food everywhere

103
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,070
Beans is about all we got left

104
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,380
Got whisky or somethin'?

105
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,170
Dumb-ass mule!

106
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,730
I can't believe that. God-damn!

107
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,390
Let me see

108
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Shit

109
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,740
Well, we gotta do something
about this food situation

110
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,450
Maybe Ill shoot one of the sheep

111
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,450
Yeah, what if Aguirre
finds out, huh?

112
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,850
Supposed to guard
the sheep, not eat em

113
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,370
Whats the matter with you?
There are thousands of em

114
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,420
I'll stick with beans

115
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,420
Well, I wont

116
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,940
Whoo-wee! Yeah!

117
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,480
Was getting tired of
your dumb-ass missin

118
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,480
Let's get a move on

119
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,360
Don't want the Game and
Fish to catch us with no elk

120
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,760
Come on. Shit!

121
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,270
Yeah, Im commutin
four hours a day...

122
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,230
I come in for breakfast...

123
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,900
I go back to the sheep...

124
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,510
Evenin' get em bedded down...

125
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,830
Come in for supper...
go back to the sheep...

126
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,530
Spend half the night
checkin' for damn coyotes

127
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,450
Aguirre got no right
making me do this

128
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,040
You wanna switch? I wouldnt
mind sleepin out there

129
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,905
That aint the point...

130
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,550
Point is, we both
oughta be in this camp

131
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,550
Goddam pup tent smells
like cat piss or worse

132
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,870
I wouldnt mind bein out there

133
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,560
Well, Im happy to
switch with you, but...

134
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,560
I warn you, I cant
cook worth a damn

135
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,670
I am pretty good with
a can opener, though

136
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,690
You cant be no worse than me, then

137
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,990
Here you go

138
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,710
You won't get much
sleep, I tell you that

139
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,440
Yeah. Come on

140
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,160
Shot a coyote up there

141
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,980
A big son of a bitch

142
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,610
Balls on him the size of apples

143
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,120
Looked like he could
eat himself a camel

144
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,480
You want some of this hot water?

145
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,780
Its all yours

146
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,460
I dont rodeo much myself...

147
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,470
Whats the point of ridin' some
piece of stock for 8 seconds?

148
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,070
- Moneys a good point
- Uh-huh

149
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,070
True enough

150
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,380
If you dont get
stomped winnin it, eh?

151
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,680
Yeah

152
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,680
Well, my old man...

153
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,640
...hes a bull rider

154
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,290
Thank you

155
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,210
Pretty well-known in his day...

156
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,290
Though he kept his
secrets to himself

157
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,620
Never taught me a thing...
never once come to see me ride

158
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,510
Your brother and
sister do right by you?

159
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,630
They did the best they
could after my folks was gone

160
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,020
Considerin they didnt
leave us nothin but

161
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,320
$24 and in a coffee can

162
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,730
I got me a year of high school...

163
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,650
That was before the
transmission went on the pickup

164
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,650
Then my sis left... Met a
roughneck, moved to Casper...

165
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,595
And me and my brother, we...

166
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,080
we went and got ourselves some
work on a ranch up near Worland...

167
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,750
Till I was 19

168
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,050
Then he got married, and uh...

169
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,470
no more room for me

170
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,410
Thats how come...

171
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,120
...me end up here

172
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,630
What?

173
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,690
Man, thats more words than
you spoke in the past 2 weeks

174
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,100
Hell, thats the most
I've spoke in a year

175
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,580
But my dad, he was a fine roper...

176
00:22:22,615 --> 00:22:24,100
Didnt rodeo much, though

177
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,230
He thought rodeo
cowboys was all fuck-ups

178
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,000
The hell they are...

179
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,160
Well...

180
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,770
- Yeehaw
- There you go

181
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,100
I'm spurrin' his guts out!

182
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,310
Wavin to the girls in the stands!

183
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:51,420
Hes kickin me to high heaven...
but he don't jackboard me! No!

184
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,550
I think my dad was right...

185
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,830
Tent dont look right

186
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:48,470
It aint goin nowhere... Let it be!

187
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,240
That harmonica dont
sound quite right either

188
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,940
That's 'cause it
got kind of flattened

189
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,640
when that mare threw me

190
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,640
Oh, yeah?

191
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,310
I thought you said that
mare couldnt throw you

192
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,810
Uh... she got lucky

193
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,210
Yeah, well, if I got lucky, that
harmonica would've broke in two

194
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,400
# I know I shall meet you #

195
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,910
# on that final day #

196
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,910
# Water-walking Jesus #

197
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,810
# take me away #

198
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,810
Very good

199
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,510
Oh, yeah...

200
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,270
My mama, she believes
in the Pentecost

201
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,770
Oh, yeah?

202
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,760
What exactly is the
Pentecost? I mean...

203
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,360
...my folks, they was Methodist

204
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,260
Pentecost... I don't know...
I don't know Pentecost is...

205
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:46,960
Mom never explained it to me. I
guess it's when the world ends and...

206
00:24:46,995 --> 00:24:49,960
fellas like you and
me, we march off to hell

207
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,560
Speak for yourself...

208
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,960
You may be a sinner

209
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,360
but I ain't yet had the opportunity

210
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,410
Thank you

211
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,910
Shit...

212
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:09,250
Im gonna go up to the sheep now

213
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,250
Give 'em hell...

214
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,560
No, I'm...

215
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,060
You can hardly stand. Its
too late to go to them sheep

216
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,310
Well, you got an extra blanket?

217
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,810
I'll just roll up out here...

218
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,400
grab 40 winks...

219
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,900
and I'll ride out at first light

220
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:43,290
Youll freeze your ass of
when that fire dies down

221
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,690
Oh, that's good

222
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,690
You're better off
sleepin' in the tent

223
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,190
Yeah...

224
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,090
All right

225
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,580
Ennis!

226
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,960
What?

227
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,660
Just quit your yammerin'
and get in here!

228
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:51,370
Whatre you doin?

229
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:57,200
See you for supper

230
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,370
Come on

231
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,540
This is a one-shot thing
we got goin on here

232
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,000
Its nobodys business but ours

233
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,350
You know I aint queer

234
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,080
Me neither

235
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,780
It's all right

236
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,880
It's all right

237
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,780
Lie back. Come on

238
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,680
Twist...

239
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,790
Your Uncle Harolds in
the hospital with pneumonia

240
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,600
Docs dont expect hell make it

241
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:59,190
Your ma sent me to tell
you, so... here I am

242
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,050
Bad news

243
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:07,810
There aint nothing I can
do about it up here, I guess

244
00:35:07,845 --> 00:35:10,840
Theres not much you can do
about it down there, neither

245
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,610
Unless you can cure pneumonia

246
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,430
Jesus...

247
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,190
Them sheepll drift if I
dont get back up there tonight

248
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,490
You'll get pitched off your
mount in a storm like this

249
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,790
You'll wish you hadn't tried it!

250
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,290
It's too cold! Close it up!

251
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,790
Well, what are we
supposed to do now, huh?

252
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,540
Get on in there and untangle' em
Chilean sheep out of ours, I guess

253
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,340
Oh, where is it? Shit!

254
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,350
God, half the goddamn
paint brands have wore off!

255
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:32,990
Weve gotta try. The least we can do

256
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,810
is get the count right for Aguirre

257
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,260
- Fuck Aguirre!
- Oh yeah, fuck Aguirre...

258
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:41,460
What if we need to work for
him again? You think of that?

259
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,670
We gotta stick this out, Jack

260
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:02,330
Youll run them sheep off
again, if you dont quiet down

261
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,710
What are you doin?

262
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,340
Aguirre came by again

263
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,050
Says my uncle didnt die after all

264
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,870
Says bring em down

265
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,240
Bring em down, why?
Its the middle of August

266
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,830
Says theres a storm comin

267
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,140
movin' in from the
Pacific. Worse than this one

268
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,950
That snow barely stuck an hour. Huh?

269
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,170
Besides, that
son-of-a-bitch,

270
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,690
hes cuttin us out
of a whole months pay

271
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,490
It ain't right

272
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,700
Well, I can spare you a loan,
bud, if you're short on cash

273
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,500
Give it to you when we get to Signal

274
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,700
I don't need your money, huh?

275
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,380
You know, I ain't
in the poorhouse...

276
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,040
Shit!

277
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,420
All right

278
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,750
Time to get goin, cowboy

279
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,790
Come here!

280
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,160
- This aint no rodeo, cowboy
- Oh, shit!

281
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,330
Ennis... Ennis

282
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,800
Come here. You okay?

283
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,500
- You okay?
- Yeah

284
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:48,060
Some of these never
went up there with you...

285
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,650
Count aint what Id
hoped for, neither...

286
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,020
You ranch stiffs...
you aint ever no good

287
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,450
Wanna give it some gas?

288
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:28,130
I cant believe I left
my damn shirt up there

289
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,030
Yeah...

290
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,920
You gonna do this again next summer?

291
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:40,760
Well, maybe not... Like I said, me
and Almas gettin married in November.

292
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:46,170
So... Ill try to get
something on a ranch, I guess

293
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,870
And you?

294
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,920
Might go up to my daddys place...

295
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,380
and give him a hand
through the winter

296
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,180
I might be back... If
the army dont get me

297
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,890
Well, I guess Ill
see you around, huh?

298
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,980
Right

299
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:25,870
What the fuck are
you lookin at? Huh?

300
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,040
<i>...and forgive us our trespasses</i>

301
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,420
<i>as we forgive those
who trespass against us</i>

302
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:41,020
<i>Lead us not into temptation,but
deliver us from evil</i>

303
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:44,030
<i>For Thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory...</i>

304
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,190
<i>for ever and ever. Amen</i>

305
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,160
Under the powers vested in me...

306
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:52,120
I now pronounce you man and wife

307
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,440
You may kiss the bride

308
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,050
And if you dont, I will

309
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,200
You all right?

310
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:24,440
Stop!... No please, stop!

311
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,130
My old ladys tryin to
get me to quit this job

312
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:36,130
She says I'm gettin' too old to be
breakin' my back shovelin' asphalt

313
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,230
I told her strong backs

314
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,430
and weak minds runs in the family

315
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:43,430
She didn't think that was too funny

316
00:44:43,465 --> 00:44:45,590
I told her it keeps me fit

317
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:51,190
<i>Mornin'... Mornin'!</i>

318
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:56,190
<i>Pulled in last night...
Didn't want to wake you up</i>

319
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,890
<i>Oh, no, I was just...</i>

320
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,190
<i>I thought I'd tell you
before the Sergeant showed up</i>

321
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,990
<i>Parking this trailer
on the beach is illegal</i>

322
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,880
Yeah!

323
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:33,200
Well, look what the wind blew in...

324
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,450
Hi, Mr. Aguirre

325
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:38,350
I was wonderin if you was
needin any help this summer

326
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,770
You're wastin your time here

327
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:44,110
What, you aint got nothin?

328
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:47,790
Nothin up on Brokeback?

329
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:51,870
I aint got no work for you

330
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:03,590
Ennis Del Mar aint
been around, has he?

331
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:10,430
You boys sure found a way to
make the time pass up there

332
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:16,110
Twist... you guys wasn't
gettin paid to leave the dogs

333
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,300
to babysit the sheep
while you stemmed the rose

334
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,930
Now get the hell out of my trailer

335
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:14,770
How my girls doin?

336
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,500
All right. Jennys
still got a runny nose

337
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:44,760
Ennis, could you
wipe Alma Jrs nose?

338
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,580
If I had three hands I could!

339
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:50,680
Come here. Come here. Oh!

340
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:21,560
- Girls all right?
- Yeah

341
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,100
Jenny stopped her coughin'

342
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:28,230
I think you should take the
girls into town this weekend

343
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:31,630
and get em an
ice-cream... or somethin...

344
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:38,450
Cant we move to town?

345
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,940
Im tired of these
lonesome old ranches

346
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:45,840
No one for Alma Jr. to play with...

347
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:47,795
Besides, Im scared for Jenny...

348
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:51,490
...scared she has another
one of 'em bad asthma spells

349
00:48:51,525 --> 00:48:54,380
No, rent in towns too high

350
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,580
There's a cheap place in
Riverton, over the Laundromat

351
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,470
I bet I could fix it up real nice

352
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:07,710
Oh, I bet you could fix this
place up real nice if you wanted to

353
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,810
- Ennis...
- Hmm?

354
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,020
I know youd like it, too

355
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:18,520
Real home... Other kids for
the girls to play with...

356
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:24,120
Not so lonely like
you were raised...

357
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:28,330
You dont want it to
be so lonely, do you?

358
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:32,730
Yeah

359
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:37,030
Come here

360
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,960
I aint so lonely now, is it?

361
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,670
You sure the girls are asleep?

362
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,870
Yeah

363
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:06,370
Come here

364
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:20,170
Ennis...

365
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:24,270
<i>Let 'er rip and snort, boys!</i>

366
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:27,170
<i>Jack Twist, hangin'
on for dear life!</i>

367
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:31,170
<i>And down he goes!
Watch out there, fella!</i>

368
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:34,670
<i>He's comin' for you.
Send in the clowns!</i>

369
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,570
<i>Okay, a fine ride by Mr. Twist</i>

370
00:50:36,571 --> 00:50:38,070
Shit!

371
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,770
<i>Four seconds for him</i>

372
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,280
<i>Give 'em a hand, folks,
our very own rodeo clowns!</i>

373
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,280
Give us a beer, Doug

374
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:04,680
I'd like to buy Jimbo here a beer

375
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,480
Best damn rodeo clown
I've ever worked with

376
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,480
No thanks, cowboy

377
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:15,480
If I was to let every rodeo
hand I pulled a bull off of...

378
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:18,780
buy me liquor, I'd have
been a alcoholic long ago

379
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,280
Pullin' bulls off of you
buckaroos is just my job

380
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,775
So save your money

381
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:32,180
for your next entry fee, cowboy

382
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:49,470
You ever try calf ropin?

383
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:57,000
Do I look like I can afford
a fuckin ropin horse?

384
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:14,820
Shouldn't we move a little closer?

385
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:17,500
No. Come on, let's
don't. Jenny'll get scared

386
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:25,860
Woo-wee! Look at this crowd!

387
00:52:25,895 --> 00:52:29,460
Bound to be a lot of pussy on
the hoof in a crowd like this

388
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:31,560
All swelled up with
patriotic feeling...

389
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:33,360
and ready to be humped like a frog

390
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:35,960
So, where do you figure
the most pussy is at?

391
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:37,860
Las Vegas or California?

392
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:38,860
Hell, I don't know...

393
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:41,840
but if you make it between Montana
and Wyoming, I'd take Wyoming

394
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:45,140
Hey! You might want to keep it
down, I got two little girls here

395
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:48,730
Fuck you. Asshole...

396
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:52,330
Probably quit givin' it to his
wife after his kids was born

397
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,730
- You know what that's like
- Yeah

398
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:57,430
Ennis... Ennis... Ennis!...

399
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,530
Ennis, let's move.
Let's just move, okay?

400
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:06,160
Now, I don't want
any trouble from you

401
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:08,440
You need to shut your
slop-bucket mouths, you hear me?

402
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,000
You ought to listen
to your old lady, then

403
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:12,700
- Is that right?
- Yeah. Move somewhere else

404
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,370
What about it? You wanna lose
about half your fuckin teeth, huh?

405
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:20,870
Not tonight, bud.
I'd sure rather not

406
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:30,365
It's ok... It's ok...

407
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,680
<i>Here she comes, ladies and
gentlemen! Oh boy, look at her fly!</i>

408
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:37,385
<i>Its Lureen Milton from
right here in Childress, Texas</i>

409
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,950
<i>Come on folks, shes one of

410
00:53:40,985 --> 00:53:42,987
<i>Shes turnin' on two...</i>

411
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:45,590
<i>Shes around three!</i>

00:53:45,625 --> 00:53:48,570
<i>Come on folks! Help her home!</i>

413
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,630
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

414
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:54,810
<i>And the time is... 16 and 9!</i>

415
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:03,610
<i>Here's Cheyenne Hodson
from Cody, Wyoming!</i>

416
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,510
<i>Come on, girl!</i>

417
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,310
<i>She's headed around two!</i>

418
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:12,760
Maam...

419
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,560
<i>Come on, Cheyenne!</i>

420
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,560
<i>And her time is 17 and 2!</i>

421
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,460
<i>Here comes Scotty Griffiths,

422
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:29,360
<i>Come on, Scotty!</i>

423
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:33,960
<i>Damn it! Let's give Scotty
Griffiths a big hand, folks</i>

424
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:35,460
<i>Better luck next time, cowboy</i>

425
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:38,460
<i>Boy, I tell you, folks, what a
heck of a way to make a living!</i>

426
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:40,950
<i>Next up is a
up-and-comer!</i>

427
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:45,930
<i>Jack Twist, all the way up
from Lightning Flat, Wyoming</i>

428
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,930
<i>He's onboard Sleepy
today! Let's hope he's not</i>

429
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,930
<i>Okay!...</i>

432
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,230
<i>Oh, boy! Good ride, cowboy!</i>

433
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:06,130
<i>Lets see what the judges say...</i>

434
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:09,450
<i>I tell you, folks, that sure

435
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,940
You know that girl?

$100,000 tractors... shit like that

439
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:57,330
What you waitin for
cowboy? A matin' call?

440
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:05,930
<i># No one's gonna love you like me #</i>

441
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:11,430
<i># No one else, can't you see? #</i>

442
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:16,330
<i># No one's gonna love you like me #</i>

<i># you felt so sad and blue #</i>

451
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,430
Wait, hold on...

452
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:38,830
You don't think I'm
too fast, do you?

453
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,830
Maybe we should put the brakes on?

454
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:45,030
Fast or slow, I just like
the direction you're goin'

455
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,540
- You are in a hurry
- My daddy's the hurry...

456
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,040
He expects me home
with the car by midnight

457
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,780
- Hey, Monroe
- Hey, En

458
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:18,080
Is Alma here?

459
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:19,480
Yeah, she's in the condiments aisle

460
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:21,480
- The what?
- Ketchup

461
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:22,480
Thanks

462
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:25,280
<i>Your boy gonna play again this year?</i>

463
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:29,000
Hey honey! Hoeny, what
are yall doin here?

464
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:34,000
Big hurry. My boss called and, well,
he wants me to go up to the ranch

465
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,490
I guess all the heifers must've
decided to calve at the same time

466
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,790
I figured I could drop
the girls off with you

467
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,290
Ennis... well...

468
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,590
I got a million things I gotta
do here before I can leave

469
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:45,740
I dont get off for
another three hours

470
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:48,595
- Mama, I need crayons
- Not now, Alma

471
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:51,890
Ennis, please, you promised
youd take them tonight

472
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,390
Alma, I can't afford not to
be there when the heifers calve

473
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,790
Right, it'd be my job
if I lose any of 'em

474
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,790
What about my job?

475
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:05,020
OK, all right. I'll call my
sister. I'll see if she can take em

476
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:06,520
All right. All right

477
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:08,220
You be a good girl for
your mama, all right?

478
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,520
I'll be half the night

479
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:12,020
Bring home some ground
steaks if you think of it

480
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:15,620
Come here. Oh, Alma, please!

481
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:20,360
Oh boy!

482
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:22,780
- Ok
- Monroe, I am so sorry!

483
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:24,580
It's okay. It's okay, Alma

484
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,680
I'll clean this up just
as soon as I call my sister

485
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:28,880
to come get the girls

486
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:31,180
Really, Alma, it's okay. I'll get it

487
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,480
- Alma, come with me
- Watch your feet

488
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:35,550
Alma!

489
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,850
Honey, got a surprise for you

490
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:41,950
Hey!...

491
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:46,550
I got two whole boxes
of formula for you

492
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:47,850
You did?

493
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,750
- 120 cans
- 120?

494
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:52,650
L.D., where did you put 'em?

495
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,850
Oh, hell, back seat of
the car, where I left 'em

496
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,130
Rodeo can get em

497
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:06,070
L.D... I can already see
who little Bobby looks like

498
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,270
Good job, little girl

499
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:09,471
He's the spittin' image of his grandpa

500
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,180
Isnt he just the spitting
image of his grandpa?

501
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,980
Yeah...

502
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,980
Look at those eyes...

503
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,480
LAUNDROMAT

504
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,180
Hey

505
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:52,980
Hey, honey...

506
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:59,850
Hey Ennis, you
somebody name of Jack?

507
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:04,620
Maybe... why?

508
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:08,200
Cause you got a postcard.
It come general delivery

509
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:12,985
<i>Friend, this letter is long over due</i>

510
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:15,895
<i>Coming through on the 24th. Drop
me a line say if your there. Jack</i>

511
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:23,050
Is it somebody you
cowboyed with, or what?

512
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:26,090
No, Jack, he rodeos, mostly

513
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:30,950
We was fishin buddies

514
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:13,960
I'll color the beach

515
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,810
Maybe we could get a babysitter

516
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:23,810
Huh?

517
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:27,010
Take your friend to
the Knife and Fork...

518
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,620
No... Jack aint the restaurant type

519
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,420
We'll more likely just
go out and get drunk

520
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,570
If he shows...

521
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,920
Ok, we take one more bite and
then we finish with dinner?

522
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:49,280
There, thats a good bite.
All right, youre excused

523
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:14,510
Jack fuckin Twist!

524
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:20,880
You
son-of-a-bitch

525
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:27,380

526
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:30,910

528
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:35,860

529
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,790
- Oh, you got a kid

530
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:42,900

531
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:47,610
- Yeah?

532
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,610
I married the prettiest
little gal in Childress, Texas

533
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,310
- Yeah?
- Lureen

534
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:53,910
Yeah...

535
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:57,550
So me and Jack, were gonna head
out, and get ourselves a drink

536
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:58,750
Yeah?

537
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:02,050
- Sure enough
- Pleased to meet you, maam

538
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:05,840
We might not get back tonight... We
get to drinkin and talkin and all

539
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,240
Ennis?

540
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:09,150
Could you get me a pack of smokes?

541
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:12,450
If you need smokes, Alma, they're
in the top pocket of my blue shirt

542
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,050
There in the bedroom

543
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:29,870
- 4 years, damn!
- Yeah, 4 years

544
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,350
Didnt think Id hear from you again

545
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:38,380
I figured you were
sore from that punch

546
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:42,200
Right next summer I drove
back up to Brokeback...

547
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:44,570
talked to Aguirre about a job and...

548
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,470
he told me you hadn't
been back, so I left

549
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:53,460
Went down to Texas for
rodeoin... Thats how I met Lureen

550
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:58,030
Made $2,000 that year
bullridin. Nearly starved...

551
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:01,750
Lureens old man
makes serious money...

552
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:03,810
farm machine business... of course

553
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:06,730
He hates my guts... though

554
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:12,830
- The army didnt get you?
- Nope, too busted up

555
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:15,330
And rodeoin' ain't what
it was in my daddy's day

556
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:17,730
Got out while I could still walk

557
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:23,230
Swear to God, I didn't know we
was goin' to get into this again

558
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:28,850
Oh yes, I did. I
red-lined it all the way

559
01:06:28,885 --> 01:06:31,140
I couldnt get here fast enough...

560
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:32,780
What about you?

561
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:35,680
Me?

562
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,920
I dont know...

563
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,800
Old Brokeback got us good, dont it?

564
01:06:54,090 --> 01:06:56,010
What are we gonna do now?

565
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:03,160
My God, theres nothin we can do...

566
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:09,530
Cause Im stuck
with what I got here

567
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:16,910
Makin a livins about
all I got time for, now

568
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,085
Hey...

569
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,940
Well, me and Jacks headin out for
the mountains for a day or two...

570
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:47,260
Do ourselves a little fishin

571
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:57,520
You know, your friend could come
inside, have a cup of coffee...

572
01:07:58,030 --> 01:07:59,980
Oh, hes from Texas...

573
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,240
Texans dont drink coffee?

574
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,780
You sure that forman wont
fire you for takin off?

575
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:17,190
You know, that foreman he owes me...

576
01:08:17,225 --> 01:08:20,260
I worked through a blizzard last
Christmas. You remember that?

577
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:22,960
Besides, Ill only
be a couple of days

578
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:29,690
Bring fish, daddy. A big, big one

579
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:45,660
Come here...

580
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:50,900
See you Sunday at the latest

581
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:03,090
<i>Im starvin. Wanna
get something to eat?</i>

582
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:03,890
Yep

583
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,510
<i>Last one in</i>

584
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:55,160
Is there anything interesting
up there in Heaven?

585
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:58,730
Well, I was just sending
up a prayer of thanks

586
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,830
For what?

587
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:05,400
For you forgettin to
bring that harmonica!

588
01:10:05,435 --> 01:10:07,880
Im enjoyin the peace and quiet

589
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,880
You know, it could be like
this, just like this, always

590
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:18,130
Yeah? Howd you figure that?

591
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:25,910
What about if you and me had a
little ranch, somewhere... little...

592
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:29,850
...cow and calf operation?
It'd be a sweet life...

593
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,900
Hell, Lureens old man...

594
01:10:32,935 --> 01:10:35,050
you bet hed give me a
down payment to get lost

595
01:10:35,085 --> 01:10:38,030
I mean, he... more or
less already said it

596
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,150
No, I

597
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,900
I told you... it
aint gonna be that way

598
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,400
You know... you...

599
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:53,820
...you got your wife
and baby in Texas, and...

600
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:57,360
...you know, I got
my life in Riverton

601
01:10:58,170 --> 01:10:59,710
That so?

602
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:02,015
You and Alma, thats a life?

603
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:05,500
Now you shut up about Alma...
This aint her fault...

604
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:09,640
The bottom line is

605
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:16,280
were around each other and...
this thing grabs hold of us again

606
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:18,070
...in the wrong place...

607
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:20,740
...in the wrong time...

608
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:23,320
...were dead

609
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,330
I tell you

610
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:31,720
there were these two old guys
ranched up together, down home...

611
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,960
<i>Earl and Ritch</i>

612
01:11:36,530 --> 01:11:37,920
<i>...and they was the joke of town</i>

613
01:11:37,955 --> 01:11:41,120
<i>even though they were
pretty tough old birds...</i>

614
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:51,730
<i>Anyway, they found Earl
dead... in an irrigation ditch</i>

615
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:55,420
<i>They took a tire iron to him...</i>

616
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:59,240
<i>Spurred him up, drug him around
by his dick till it pulled off</i>

617
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,150
You seen this?

618
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:06,560
Yeah, I was what? Nine years old?

619
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:11,700
<i>My daddy... he made sure
me and my brother seen it</i>

620
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,710
Hell, for all I
know, he done the job

621
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:25,430
Two guys livin together? No way

622
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,050
Now, we can get together
once in a while...

623
01:12:29,051 --> 01:12:31,720
way the hell out in the
middle of nowhere, but...

624
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:34,800
"Once in a while"...

625
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:37,870
Every 4 fuckin years?

626
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:42,760
Well, If you cant fix it,
Jack, you gotta stand it

627
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:46,950
For how long?

628
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:51,920
As long as we can ride it

629
01:12:56,570 --> 01:12:59,250
There aint no reins on this one

630
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,940
<i>Its nearly supper time. Where in
the hell do you think youre goin?</i>

631
01:13:17,975 --> 01:13:18,700
<i>To work!</i>

632
01:13:18,701 --> 01:13:21,601
<i>- I thought you had the day off!
- Well, you thought wrong!</i>

633
01:13:21,636 --> 01:13:22,790
<i>The girls need to be fed</i>

634
01:13:22,791 --> 01:13:23,960
Well, you take care of it!

635
01:13:23,961 --> 01:13:25,561
<i>Alma!...</i>

636
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:26,740
Alma!

637
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:28,325
Supper is on the stove!

640
01:13:32,695 --> 01:13:35,070

641
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:36,930

01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,870

Listen to her purr, gentlemen. Youre

646
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,530
I told you what she could do
it, now Im gonna show you.

647
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:14,550
Say, didnt that pissant

648
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:18,120
He used to try!

649
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:43,190
<i>Ennis, see you in a couple weeks
fish should be jumpin. Jack</i>

650
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:51,520
Honey...

651
01:14:51,521 --> 01:14:53,321
have you seen my blue parka?

652
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:55,780
Um, last time I seen
it you was in it...

653
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:57,790
Day we had that big ice storm...

654
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:01,370
Well, could have
sworn I seen it here

655
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,420
You know...

656
01:15:05,621 --> 01:15:07,620
you've been goin up to
Wyoming all these years

657
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:10,410
Why cant your buddy come
down here to Texas and fish?

658
01:15:10,445 --> 01:15:13,060
Because the Big Horn
Mountains aint in Texas

659
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:16,520
And I dont think that his pick-up
could make it down here anyway

660
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:19,220
New model comin in
this week, remember?

661
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:22,490
You the best combine salesman we got

662
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,450
Youre the only combine
salesman, in fact...

663
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:28,060
Yeah, well, Ill be back in a week.
That is unless I freeze to death...

664
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:29,930
And Ill freeze if I
dont find that Parka!

665
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:31,900
Well, I dont have the goddam Parka!

666
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:34,970
You know, youre worse than Bobby
when it comes to losin stuff

667
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:38,450
Oh, speakin of Bobby, did you call
his school about gettin him a tutor?

668
01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:42,210
- I thought you were gonna call
- I complain too much

669
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:43,865
- The teacher dont like me...
- Right

670
01:15:43,866 --> 01:15:47,120
- Now its your turn
- Okay, fine, so I'll call later

671
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:51,900
All right, fine...

672
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:53,870
Bye

673
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:56,990
I got 14 hours of
drivin ahead of me

674
01:15:56,991 --> 01:15:59,140
See now, it dont seem fair

675
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:01,100
You goin up there two
or three times a year...

676
01:16:01,101 --> 01:16:02,810
him never comin down here

677
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,530
Ennis, they got an openin over at
the power company. Might be good pay

678
01:16:24,031 --> 01:16:27,231
Well, as clumsy as I am,
I'd probably get electrocuted

679
01:16:27,232 --> 01:16:29,732
Daddy, the church
picnic's next weekend

680
01:16:29,733 --> 01:16:32,033
Will you be back from
fishin' by next weekend?

681
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:33,720
Please, daddy, please!

682
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,680
All right, as long as
I dont have to sing

683
01:16:36,781 --> 01:16:39,565
Daddy... Thank you

684
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,460
You forgettin somethin?

685
01:17:18,930 --> 01:17:19,850
Youre late!

686
01:17:19,851 --> 01:17:21,351
<i>Look what I brought...</i>

687
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,190
<i>Here we go. No hands!</i>

688
01:17:44,191 --> 01:17:46,791
<i>It's all yours,
buddy! It's all yours</i>

689
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:53,750
<i>Come on... Come on...</i>

690
01:18:03,151 --> 01:18:04,951
<i>Come on in, Alvin...</i>

691
01:18:05,752 --> 01:18:08,452
<i>I've been trying to
call you for hours</i>

692
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:10,980
Its Saturday night. You

693
01:18:10,981 --> 01:18:13,320
and head on over
to the church social

694
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:17,140
That fire and brimstone crowd?

695
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:22,130
I think itd be nice

696
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:40,365
Ennis... as far behind
as we are in the bills...

697
01:18:40,366 --> 01:18:43,260
it makes me nervous not
to take no precaution

698
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,765
If you dont want
no more of my kids...

699
01:18:49,466 --> 01:18:52,290
Id be happy to leave you alone

700

Id have em, if
youd support em...

701
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:17,690

717

So, here I am

720
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:42,725
I had to ask about 10
different people in Riverton

721
01:20:42,726 --> 01:20:44,490
where you had moved to

722
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:52,610
I guess... I thought
that this means you...

723
01:20:54,011 --> 01:20:57,311
No... Jack...

724
01:20:58,212 --> 01:21:00,611
I don't know what to say...

725
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:04,760
See, I got the girls
this weekend, and...

726
01:21:05,661 --> 01:21:07,475
Jeez, I...

01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:09,240

728
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,440
You know I am

729
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,810
See, I only get em once and

730
01:21:15,811 --> 01:21:19,920

731
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:26,630

Whoa there, Rodeo. Stud duck

738
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:45,400
You bet, LD, I was just

739
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,425
Bobby? I you dont eat your dinner

740
01:23:54,426 --> 01:23:56,450

01:23:56,740 --> 01:24:00,200
Why mama? Im gonna be eating
this food for the next two weeks

742
01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:02,000
Hey, you heard your mama

743
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:07,700
You can finish your meal, and
then you can watch the game

744
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:21,670
Daddy...

745
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:25,470
Daddy!

746

Hell, we dont eat with our eyes!

747
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,900
You want the boy to grow up to
be a man, dont you, daughter?

748
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,110
Boys should watch football

749
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:44,375
Like Hell. Not until he
finishes eating the meal...

750
01:24:44,376 --> 01:24:47,380
that his mama took
three hours fixin

751
01:24:58,130 --> 01:25:00,590
You sit down, you
old son-of-a-bitch!

752
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:07,310
This is my house, this is my
child and you are my guest

753
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:11,900
Now you sit down before I knock
your ignorant ass into next week

754
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:06,490
Daddy... tell about when
you rode broncs in the rodeo

755
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,415
Well... thats a short story honey

756
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:13,250
I t was only about 3
seconds I was on that bronc

757
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:17,630
Next thing I knew, I was
flyin through the air

758
01:26:18,430 --> 01:26:21,120
Only I was no angel
like you and Jenny, here

759
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,600
I didnt have no wings

760
01:26:26,230 --> 01:26:29,650
And thats the story of...
my saddle bronc career

761
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:53,750
There you go

762
01:27:01,510 --> 01:27:03,050
You oughta get married again, Ennis

763
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:06,000
Me and the girls worry
about you bein alone so much

764
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:09,630
Hm Well, once burned

765
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:16,310
You still go fishin
with Jack Twist?

766
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:19,820
Not often

767
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:27,240
You know, I used to wonder how come
you never brought any trouts home

768
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:28,700
You always said you caught plenty

769
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:31,710
and you know how me
and the girls like fish

770
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:36,335
So one night I got
your creell case open...

771
01:27:36,336 --> 01:27:39,420
night before you went on
one of your little trips

772
01:27:41,380 --> 01:27:44,640
Price tag still on
it after five years...

773
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,470
And I tied a note to
the end of the line

774
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:53,260
It said, Hello Ennis. Bring
some fish home. Love Alma. "

775
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,690
And then you come back...
lookin all perky...

776
01:27:56,691 --> 01:27:59,840
and said you caught a bunch of
brown ones and you ate em all up

777
01:27:59,870 --> 01:28:01,530
Dyou remember?

778
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:05,535
I looked in that case
first chance I got

779
01:28:05,536 --> 01:28:06,870
and theres my note still tied there...

780
01:28:06,871 --> 01:28:08,940
That line hadnt touched
water in its life!...

781
01:28:08,975 --> 01:28:10,500
That dont mean nothin, Alma

782
01:28:10,830 --> 01:28:14,960
Dont try and fool me no more,
Ennis. I know what it means...

783
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:18,790
- Jack Twist...
- Alma...

784
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:24,265
Jack "Nasty". You didnt
go up there to fish, you

785
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:27,140
Now you listen to me. You
dont know nothin about it...

786
01:28:27,175 --> 01:28:29,525
Ah! Im gonna yell for Monroe

787
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:32,020
You do it... Ill make
you eat the fuckin floor

788
01:28:32,021 --> 01:28:34,580
Get out! Get out! Get out!

789
01:28:34,615 --> 01:28:36,520
Get out of my house!

790
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:39,780

791
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:43,400

792
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,160
Bye, Daddy!

793
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:49,080
Bye!

794
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:05,720
Hey, asshole, watch
where youre goin!

795
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:15,190
You stupid fucker!

796
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:20,850
Goddam

797
01:30:19,929 --> 01:30:21,529
<i>All I'm sayin' is...</i>

798
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:23,430
...what's the point of making it?

799
01:30:23,465 --> 01:30:26,210
If the tax dont get you, the
inflation will eat it all up

800
01:30:31,470 --> 01:30:35,230
You should see Lureen, punchin
numbers in her addin machine

801
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:38,770
Hunting for extra zeros... her
eyes gettin' smaller and smaller

802
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,975
It's like watchin a rabbit...

803
01:30:41,976 --> 01:30:43,063
tryin to squeeze into a snake hole

804
01:30:43,064 --> 01:30:44,865
with a coyote on its tail

805
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:47,610
Thats some high-class
entertainment if you ask me

806
01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:51,190
For what its worth...

807
01:30:55,410 --> 01:30:58,290
You and Lureen
its... normal an all?

808
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:02,600
Sure

809
01:31:04,550 --> 01:31:06,680
She dont ever suspect?

810
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:19,140
You ever get the feelin...

811
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:21,230
...I dont know...

812
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:26,580
when youre in town and
someone looks at you...

813
01:31:26,615 --> 01:31:29,580
suspicious... like he knows

814
01:31:30,650 --> 01:31:32,560
Then you go out on the pavement
and everyones lookin at you

815
01:31:32,561 --> 01:31:34,270
like they all know, too?

816
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:43,180
Maybe you oughta get
out of there, you know?

817
01:31:45,670 --> 01:31:48,510
Find yourself some place
different, maybe Texas

818
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:51,230
Texas?

819
01:31:52,631 --> 01:31:54,315
Sure, and maybe you
can convince Alma

820
01:31:54,316 --> 01:31:56,000
to let you and Lureen
adopt the girls

821
01:31:56,030 --> 01:31:58,820
Then we could just live
together, herdin' sheep

822
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:00,890
And itll rain money
from LD Newsome...

823
01:32:00,891 --> 01:32:04,080
and whisky will flow in the
stream... Jack, thats real smart...

824
01:32:04,115 --> 01:32:06,295
Go to hell, Ennis Del Mar...

825
01:32:06,296 --> 01:32:08,630
You wanna live your miserable
fuckin life? Then go right ahead

826
01:32:08,631 --> 01:32:10,331
- Fine
- I was just thinkin out loud...

827
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:12,280
Yup, youre a real thinker, there

828
01:32:12,315 --> 01:32:13,681
Goddam...

829
01:32:14,710 --> 01:32:18,230
Jack fuckin Twist.
Got it all figured out, aint ya?

830
01:32:23,231 --> 01:32:24,931
<i>All right, hon...</i>

831
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:41,550
Just finished my shift...
Wanna dance?

832
01:32:41,570 --> 01:32:43,340
Well, I was on my way to

833
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:46,085
- Im Cassie, Cassie Farrah

834
01:32:46,486 --> 01:32:49,020
Ennis... Del Mar

835
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:20,320
No more dancin for me, I hope

836
01:33:20,730 --> 01:33:23,630
Youre safe. My feet hurt...

837
01:33:24,150 --> 01:33:25,400
Its hard work, is it?

838
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:26,190
Yeah!

839
01:33:26,191 --> 01:33:29,891
Drunks like you, demanding
beer after beer...

840
01:33:29,926 --> 01:33:32,870
smokin'... Gets tiresome

841
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:36,720
What do you do, Ennis Del Mar?

842
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:41,170
Well... earlier today
I was castrating calves

843
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:47,930
What are you doin?

844
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:51,090
Tryin to get a foot rub, dummy

845
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:56,320
All right...

846
01:33:58,140 --> 01:33:59,770
- That good?
- Mm-uhm

847
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:23,705
And then I pledged
Tri-Delt at SMU...

848
01:34:23,706 --> 01:34:24,648
And I sure never thought

849
01:34:24,649 --> 01:34:27,244
Id end up in a poky
little place like Childress

850
01:34:27,279 --> 01:34:29,840
Then I met old Randall
here at an Aggie game...

851
01:34:29,841 --> 01:34:32,620
He was an animal husbandry major

852
01:34:32,621 --> 01:34:33,621
So we've been here for a month

853
01:34:33,622 --> 01:34:36,622
and he got the foreman job
over at Roy Taylor's ranch

854
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,690
Like it or not, here I am!...

855
01:34:38,725 --> 01:34:42,330
Was you Tri-Delt?
I was Kappa Phi myself...

856
01:34:43,810 --> 01:34:46,475
Well, even though we aint
quite sorority sisters

857
01:34:46,510 --> 01:34:49,140
we just may have to dance
with ourselves, Lureen!

858
01:34:49,175 --> 01:34:51,930
Our husbands aint the least
bit interested in dancin!

859
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:54,220
They aint got a smidgen
of rhythm between em

860
01:34:54,255 --> 01:34:55,575
Its funny, isnt it!

861
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:59,910
Husbands dont never seem to
want dance with their wives

862
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:02,660
Why do you think that is, Jack?

863
01:35:02,661 --> 01:35:05,120
I don't know, I never
give it any thought

864
01:35:06,330 --> 01:35:07,705
Wanna dance?

865
01:35:08,906 --> 01:35:10,480
Yes! Thank you!

866
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:13,790
- Do you mind?
- No, it's all right. Go ahead...

867
01:35:15,391 --> 01:35:16,305
Pardon us...

868
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:18,320
Thank you for asking
me to dance with you

869
01:35:18,321 --> 01:35:20,600
I really appreciate that.
Randall never does

870
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:26,349
Its a good thing you and Lureen
happened along when you did...

871
01:35:26,350 --> 01:35:27,504
or else wed still be stuck
on the side of the road

872
01:35:27,505 --> 01:35:28,859
in that darn pick-up...

873
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:30,425
I told Randall we
oughta take the car

874
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:31,990
Of course, hed never listen to me!

875
01:35:31,991 --> 01:35:33,991
He wouldn't listen to me if
he was goin' deaf tomorrow

876
01:35:34,792 --> 01:35:37,392
I told him it'd take
more than chewing gum...

877
01:35:37,393 --> 01:35:39,393
and baling wire to fix that pickup

878
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:42,610
Well... hes never been
very mechanical, though

879
01:35:44,511 --> 01:35:46,711
<i>- Come over here and ask...
- All right...</i>

880
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,020
You ever notice how a
woman will powder her nose

881
01:35:55,021 --> 01:35:56,700
before she goes to a party?

882
01:35:57,170 --> 01:36:00,220
And then shell powder it
again once the partys over?

883
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:04,340
Why powder your nose just
to go home and go to bed?

884
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:06,180
I dont know...

885
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:08,850
Even if I wanted to know

886
01:36:08,851 --> 01:36:11,060
I couldnt get a word in with
Lashawn long enough to ask!

887
01:36:11,810 --> 01:36:15,230
- That woman talks a blue streak
- A lively little gal...

888
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:24,990
Youll like workin
for Roy Taylor...

889
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,450
- Hes solid, Roy
- Oh yeah, Roy, hes a good old boy

890
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,800
Hes got a little...
cabin, down on Lake Kemp

891
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:40,255
Got a crop house, a little boat...

892
01:36:40,756 --> 01:36:43,100
Said I could use it whenever I want

893
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,720
We oughta go down
there some weekend

894
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:54,015
Drink a little whisky...
fish some...

895
01:36:54,316 --> 01:36:57,820
Get away... you know?

896
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:01,565
<i>That was right out of SMU</i>

897
01:37:01,566 --> 01:37:03,990
<i>I could've had my pick of pretty
much any job in North Dallas</i>

898
01:37:04,025 --> 01:37:06,480
<i>So my pick was Neiman
Marcus, which was a disaster</i>

899
01:37:06,481 --> 01:37:09,580
<i>cause honey, where clothes is
concerned, I got no resistence</i>

900
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:12,500
I was spendin more than I made.
More than Randall ever will make!

901
01:37:12,710 --> 01:37:14,277
We come out here thinking that ranchin

902
01:37:14,278 --> 01:37:16,045
was still big hats and Marlboros

903
01:37:16,046 --> 01:37:17,880
Boy, were we behind the times!

904
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:37,480
Hey there, Junior? You ready?

905
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,970
What do you think?

906
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:57,415
Your daddy ever gonna see
fit to settle down again?

907
01:37:59,416 --> 01:38:00,790
I dont know...

908
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:03,580
Maybe hes not the marryin kind...

909
01:38:05,690 --> 01:38:11,470
You dont think so? Or you
dont think Im the one for him?

910
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:15,550
Youre good enough

911
01:38:20,510 --> 01:38:23,150
You dont say much but
you get your point across

912
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:28,070
Sorry, didnt mean to be rude

913
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:31,740
Hi

914
01:38:32,660 --> 01:38:35,830
Ah! Youre stayin
on your feet, cowboy

915
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:38,420
Excuse me darlin

916
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:05,020
So Ill pick you and Jenny
up next weekend, after church

917
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,650
Fine

918
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:12,475
You all right?

919
01:39:13,976 --> 01:39:15,380
Yes

920
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:17,740
Are you sure?

921
01:39:20,540 --> 01:39:22,280
Daddy, I was thinkin...

922
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:24,150
what with a new baby and all...

923
01:39:24,151 --> 01:39:26,740
Ma and Monroe have
been awful strict on me

924
01:39:26,775 --> 01:39:28,300
More on me than Jenny, even

925
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:32,470
I was thinkin... maybe I could...

926
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:36,360
maybe I could come
and stay with you

927
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,610
Id be an awful good
help, I know I would...

928
01:39:40,890 --> 01:39:44,810
Well, I... You know
I aint set up for that

929
01:39:45,650 --> 01:39:49,570
With the round-up comin...
I wont ever be home

930
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:52,950
Its all right, daddy

931
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:56,750
- Im not sayin I wouldnt...
- Its all right, I understand

932
01:40:00,210 --> 01:40:02,060
All right, well,
Ill see you on Sunday, then

933
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:04,840
Bye

934
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:08,750
Bye, sweetheart

935
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:40,550
Going to snow tonight for sure

936
01:40:41,450 --> 01:40:42,880
Yep

937
01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:53,380
All this time, you aint
found nobody else to marry?

938
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,030
I've been puttin the blocks

939
01:40:57,031 --> 01:40:59,260
to a good lookin little
gal over in Riverton

940
01:41:01,730 --> 01:41:06,070
She's a waitress... wants to
go to nursin school or somethin...

941
01:41:08,370 --> 01:41:10,540
I dont know...

942
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:14,450
What about you and Lureen?

943
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:20,520
Lureens good at making hard
deals in the machinery business

944
01:41:20,590 --> 01:41:23,030
but as far as our marriage goes

945
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:25,810
...we could do it over the phone

946
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:38,190
I kind of got this thing with...

947
01:41:39,391 --> 01:41:41,700
the ranch foremans
wife over in Childress

948
01:41:43,210 --> 01:41:45,585
Im scared Ill get shot
by Lureen or her husband...

949
01:41:45,586 --> 01:41:47,560
each time I slip off to see her

950
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:50,590
You probably deserve it

951
01:41:57,540 --> 01:41:59,120
Tell you what...

952
01:42:04,460 --> 01:42:06,000
the truth is...

953
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:16,280
sometimes I miss you so
much I can hardly stand it

954
01:42:58,350 --> 01:43:01,140
I guess Ill head up
on to Lightning Flat...

955
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:04,810
see the folks for a day or two

956
01:43:10,850 --> 01:43:13,510
There is somethin I been
meanin to tell you, bud

957
01:43:18,240 --> 01:43:21,310
Well, its likely November
before I can come out here again

958
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:27,140
After we shift stock and...

959
01:43:27,141 --> 01:43:30,330
before winter feedin starts again

960
01:43:32,990 --> 01:43:34,590
November...

961
01:43:38,510 --> 01:43:40,830
Well, what in the hell
ever happened to August?

962
01:43:46,350 --> 01:43:48,010
Christ, Ennis...

963
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:56,970
You know, you had a fuckin week
to say some little word about this

964
01:44:00,150 --> 01:44:02,700
Why is it were always
in the friggin cold?

965
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:05,015
We oughta go south, where its warm

966
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:07,240
You know, we oughta go to Mexico!

967
01:44:08,450 --> 01:44:09,900
Mexico?

968
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:13,195
Hell Jack, you know me. About
the only travellin I ever done

969
01:44:13,196 --> 01:44:16,070
is around a coffee pot
lookin for the handle

970
01:44:18,890 --> 01:44:21,020
Come on Jack, lighten up on me

971
01:44:23,470 --> 01:44:25,210
We can hunt in November...

972
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:28,250
Kill us a nice elk...

973
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:32,505
Ill try if I can get
Don Wroes cabin again

974
01:44:32,506 --> 01:44:35,020
We had a good time
that year, didnt we?

975
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:40,570
There's never enough
time, never enough

976
01:44:44,990 --> 01:44:47,010
You know, friend...

977
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:51,320
this is a Goddam bitch of
an unsatisfactory situation

978
01:44:52,230 --> 01:44:55,620
You used to come away easy.
Now its like seein the Pope

979
01:44:58,620 --> 01:45:00,585
Jack, I got to work...

980
01:45:01,486 --> 01:45:03,150
Huh?

981
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:06,800
I mean, in them earlier
days Id just quit the job

982
01:45:09,430 --> 01:45:10,930
You

983
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:14,230
you forget what its like
bein broke all the time

984
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:20,900
You ever hear of child support?

985
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:28,610
I tell you this, I cant quit this
one... and I cant get the time off

986
01:45:32,750 --> 01:45:36,720
Its hard enough gettin this
time. The trade-off is August

987
01:45:40,540 --> 01:45:42,630
You got a better idea?

988
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:47,050
I did, once

989
01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:50,810
You did, once

990
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:58,110
Have you been in Mexico, Jack Twist?

991
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:03,790
Cause I hear what they got
in Mexico for boys like you

992
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:08,620
Hell yes, Ive been in Mexico.
Is that a fuckin problem?

993
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:20,130
Im gonna tell you this
one time, Jack fuckin Twist

994
01:46:20,831 --> 01:46:22,800
And I aint foolin...

995
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:27,660
What I dont know, all them
things that I dont know...

996
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:30,760
...I could get you killed
if I come to know them

997
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:37,440
I aint jokin

998
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:44,480
Well try this one...
and Ill say it just once...

999
01:46:44,490 --> 01:46:45,400
Go ahead...

1000
01:46:46,150 --> 01:46:46,835
I tell you what...

1001
01:46:46,836 --> 01:46:49,820
we could had a good life
together, fuckin real good life

1002
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:51,810
Had us a place of our own...

1003
01:46:52,811 --> 01:46:54,255
But you didnt want it, Ennis!...

1004
01:46:54,290 --> 01:46:58,110
So what we got now
is Brokeback Mountain!

1005
01:46:59,750 --> 01:47:02,500
Everythings built on that!
Thats all we got, boy...

1006
01:47:02,501 --> 01:47:05,801
Fuckin all! So I hope you know that,
if you don't never know the rest!

1007
01:47:05,802 --> 01:47:08,041
- God damn it...
- You count the damn few times...

1008
01:47:08,251 --> 01:47:10,280
that we have been together
in nearly 20 years

1009
01:47:10,340 --> 01:47:12,530
and you measure the short
fuckin leash you keep me on...

1010
01:47:12,531 --> 01:47:13,720
and then you ask me about Mexico

1011
01:47:13,890 --> 01:47:15,890
And then you tell me you
kill me for needin something

1012
01:47:15,891 --> 01:47:17,890
that I dont hardly never get

1013
01:47:20,690 --> 01:47:24,190
You have no idea how bad it gets...

1014
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,390
And Im not you. I cant...

1015
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:31,780
...make it on a couple
of high-altitude fucks

1016
01:47:31,781 --> 01:47:33,400
once or twice a year...

1017
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:38,460
You are too much for me, Ennis...

1018
01:47:39,290 --> 01:47:41,630
Son of a horsin bitch...

1019
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:46,060
I wish I knew how to quit you...

1020
01:47:48,590 --> 01:47:50,390
Well, why dont you?

1021
01:47:53,090 --> 01:47:55,720
Why dont you just let me be, huh?

1022
01:47:57,530 --> 01:47:59,890
Its because of you,
Jack, that Im like this...

1023
01:48:04,690 --> 01:48:08,650
Im nothin... Im nowhere...

1024
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:15,360
Get the fuck off me!

1025
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:24,840
Its all right, its all right...

1026
01:48:25,441 --> 01:48:27,130
Damn you, Ennis...

1027
01:48:28,770 --> 01:48:31,380
I just cant stand
this any more, Jack

1028
01:48:42,230 --> 01:48:44,800
<i>And now youre sleepin
on your feet like a horse...</i>

1029
01:48:48,030 --> 01:48:50,740
<i>My mom used to say that
to me when I was little</i>

1030
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:54,120
<i>And sing to me...</i>

1031
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:09,000
<i>I gotta go</i>

1032
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:13,770
<i>See you in the mornin...</i>

1033
01:50:08,690 --> 01:50:10,150
Excuse me...

1034
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:18,620
Hey! Ennis Del Mar...

1035
01:50:22,290 --> 01:50:23,900
Where you been?

1036
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:27,670
Here and there...

1037
01:50:30,210 --> 01:50:33,910
I left word for you, with
Steve, at the ranch...

1038
01:50:34,011 --> 01:50:37,310
But you must've got those
notes I left at your place...

1039
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:44,290
Looks like I got the
message in any case

1040
01:50:46,270 --> 01:50:47,610
Carl?

1041
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:53,320
Yeah, Carls nice...
He even talks...

1042
01:50:56,700 --> 01:50:58,680
Good for you...

1043
01:51:00,381 --> 01:51:01,560
Yeah...

1044
01:51:04,490 --> 01:51:06,120
Good for me...

1045
01:51:12,450 --> 01:51:14,950
I dont get you, Ennis Del Mar...

1046
01:51:20,510 --> 01:51:22,010
Im sorry...

1047
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:32,980
I was probably no
fun anyways, was I?

1048
01:51:36,110 --> 01:51:39,720
Ennis, girls dont
fall in love with fun...

1049
01:52:13,230 --> 01:52:14,790
<i>Jack, how about November 7 for
you? I can meet you at pine creek</i>

1050
01:52:14,791 --> 01:52:16,950
<i><b>DECEASED</b></i>

1051
01:52:21,780 --> 01:52:23,030
Hello...

1052
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:26,055
<i>Hello, this is... Ennis Del Mar...</i>

1053
01:52:26,856 --> 01:52:28,790
<i>Eh...</i>

1054
01:52:28,791 --> 01:52:29,791
Who?

1055
01:52:29,870 --> 01:52:32,920
- Who is this?
- Ennis Del Mar

1056
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:34,840
An old buddy of Jacks

1057
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,695
<i>Jack used to mention you...</i>

1058
01:52:37,696 --> 01:52:39,550
Youre the fishin buddy

1059
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:41,880
or the huntin buddy, I know that

1060
01:52:42,590 --> 01:52:44,780
Would have let you know
what happened but...

1061
01:52:44,781 --> 01:52:47,645
I wasnt sure about
your name or address

1062
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:50,510
Jack kept his friends
addresses in his head

1063
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:55,510
Thats what Im callin...
to see what happened

1064
01:52:57,530 --> 01:52:58,890
Oh, yeah...

1065
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:05,195
Jack was pumpin up a flat on
the truck out on the back road

1066
01:53:05,196 --> 01:53:06,950
when the tyre blew up

1067
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:11,790
The rim of the tyre slammed into
his face... broke his nose and jaw..

1068
01:53:11,825 --> 01:53:14,640
...and knocked him
unconscious on his back

1069
01:53:15,010 --> 01:53:18,870
<i>By the time somebody come along
he had drowned in his own blood</i>

1070
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:22,260
<i>He was only 39 years old...</i>

1071
01:53:26,510 --> 01:53:27,720
<i>Hello?</i>

1072
01:53:28,510 --> 01:53:29,750
<i>Hello?</i>

1073
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:31,670
<i>Hello!</i>

1074
01:53:34,850 --> 01:53:36,935
Was he buried down there?

1075
01:53:37,736 --> 01:53:39,520
We put a stone up

1076
01:53:39,530 --> 01:53:41,865
He was cremated, like he wanted.

1077
01:53:41,866 --> 01:53:43,400
Half his ashes was interred here

1078
01:53:43,450 --> 01:53:46,210
...the rest was sent
up with his folks

1079
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:49,035
He used to say he wanted his ashes

1080
01:53:49,036 --> 01:53:51,330
scattered on Brokeback Mountain

1081
01:53:51,410 --> 01:53:54,450
<i>But I wasnt sure where that was</i>

1082
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:57,680
<i>Thought Brokeback Mountain
might be around where he grew up</i>

1083
01:53:58,070 --> 01:53:59,150
<i>Knowin Jack...</i>

1084
01:53:59,451 --> 01:54:01,585
it might be some pretend place

1085
01:54:01,620 --> 01:54:05,770
where bluebirds sing, and
theres a whisky spring

1086
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:13,310
No, maam, we was... herdin
sheep on Brokeback one summer.

1087
01:54:14,270 --> 01:54:16,640
<i>Back in 1963...</i>

1088
01:54:25,150 --> 01:54:27,700
Well... he said it was
his favourite place

1089
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:32,850
I thought he meant to
get drunk. He drank a lot

1090
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:38,660
Is his folks still...
up in Lightning Flat?

1091
01:54:39,460 --> 01:54:41,550
<i>Theyll be there
till the day they die...</i>

1092
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:48,970
Thank you for your time

1093
01:54:49,850 --> 01:54:54,350
<i>I sure am sorry...
We was good friends.</i>

1094
01:55:01,320 --> 01:55:05,440
Get in touch with his folks.
I suppose theyd appreciate it

1095
01:55:05,570 --> 01:55:07,910
if his wishes was carried out...

1096
01:55:09,411 --> 01:55:11,911
About the ashes, I mean...

1097
01:56:12,090 --> 01:56:15,680
Want a cup of coffee, dont
you? Piece of cherry cake?

1098
01:56:15,681 --> 01:56:17,481
Yes, ma'am, I'll have
a cup of coffee but...

1099
01:56:17,482 --> 01:56:19,982
but I can't eat no cake just now

1100
01:56:29,190 --> 01:56:31,740
I feel awful bad about Jack

1101
01:56:34,410 --> 01:56:35,280
Thank you

1102
01:56:37,450 --> 01:56:40,120
I cant begin to tell
you how bad I feel

1103
01:56:43,250 --> 01:56:45,220
I knew him a long time

1104
01:56:48,090 --> 01:56:50,465
I come by to say...

1105
01:56:50,466 --> 01:56:54,040
if you want me to take his
ashes up there on Brokeback...

1106
01:56:55,030 --> 01:56:56,770
...like his wife said he wanted to

1107
01:56:58,310 --> 01:56:59,930
...then Id be happy to

1108
01:57:02,970 --> 01:57:04,840
Tell you what...

1109
01:57:05,900 --> 01:57:08,770
I know where
Brokeback Mountain is...

1110
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:11,425
Thought he was too goddam special

1111
01:57:11,426 --> 01:57:13,790
to be buried in the family plot

1112
01:57:17,240 --> 01:57:18,990
Jack used to say

1113
01:57:19,700 --> 01:57:22,500
"Ennis Del Mar"... he used to say...

1114
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:27,420
"Im gonna bring him up
here one of these days... "

1115
01:57:27,421 --> 01:57:31,460
"... and well lick this
damn ranch into shape"

1116
01:57:32,380 --> 01:57:36,590
He had some half-baked notion the
two of you was gonna move up here

1117
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:39,060
...build a cabin...

1118
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:42,640
...help run the place

1119
01:57:45,180 --> 01:57:47,820
Then this spring...

1120
01:57:48,621 --> 01:57:52,321
he got another fella gonna
come up here with him...

1121
01:57:53,530 --> 01:57:56,900
...build the place...
help run the ranch

1122
01:57:57,700 --> 01:58:02,870
Some ranch neighbour of
his from down in Texas...

1123
01:58:04,290 --> 01:58:08,130
Gonna split up with his
wife and come back here...

1124
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:10,420
so he says...

1125
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:14,420
But, like most of Jacks ideas...

1126
01:58:15,710 --> 01:58:18,350
never come to pass...

1127
01:58:20,570 --> 01:58:24,890
I kept his room... like
it was when he was a boy

1128
01:58:25,940 --> 01:58:28,100
I think he appreciated that

1129
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:36,490
You are welcome to go up
to his room, if you want...

1130
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:43,650
Yeah, Id like that, thank you...

1131
02:01:45,390 --> 02:01:47,040
Tell you what...

1132
02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:53,390

plot. Hes goin in it

1133
02:01:55,230 --> 02:01:57,290
