Arthur Fleck: The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't.
Arthur Fleck: I used to think that my life was a tragedy, but now I realize, it's a fucking comedy.
Arthur Fleck: For my whole life, I didn't know if I even really existed. But I do, and people are starting to notice.
Arthur Fleck: You don't listen, do you? I don't think you ever really hear me. You just ask the same questions every week. "How's your job?" "Are you having any negative thoughts?" All I have are negative thoughts.
Arthur Fleck: Murray, one small thing?
Murray Franklin: Yeah?
Arthur Fleck: When you bring me out, can you introduce me as Joker?
Arthur Fleck: Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?
Arthur Fleck: How 'bout another joke, Murray?
Murray Franklin: No, I think we've had enough of your jokes.
Arthur Fleck: What do you get...
Murray Franklin: I don't think so.
Arthur Fleck: ...when you cross...
Murray Franklin: I think we're done here now, thank you.
Arthur Fleck: ...a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash?
Murray Franklin: Call the police, Gene, call the police.
Arthur Fleck: I'll tell you what you get! You get what you fuckin' deserve!
Arkham Psychiatrist: What's so funny?
Arthur Fleck: I'm just thinking of a joke.
Arkham Psychiatrist: Do you want to tell it to me?
Arthur Fleck: You wouldn't get it.
Arthur Fleck: I killed those guys because they were awful. Everybody is awful these days. It's enough to make anyone crazy.
Murray Franklin: I'm waiting for the punchline.
Arthur Fleck: There is no punchline.
Cop: The whole city's on fire 'cause of what you did.
Arthur Fleck: I know. Isn't it beautiful?
Arthur Fleck: I just hope my death makes more cents than my life.
Arthur Fleck: I've been the man in the house for as long as I can remember. I take good care of my mother.
Murray Franklin: All that sacrifice, she must love you very much.
Arthur Fleck: She does. She always tells me to smile and put on a happy face. She says I was put here to spread joy and laughter.
Arthur Fleck: Ugh, why is everybody so upset about these guys? If it was me dying on the sidewalk you'd walk right over me! I pass you everyday and you don't notice me! But these guys? Well because Thomas Wayne would cry about them on TV?
Arthur Fleck: Have you seen what it's like out there, Murray? Do you ever actually leave the studio? Everybody just yells and screams at each other. Nobody's civil anymore. Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy. You think men like Thomas Wayne ever think what it's like to be someone like me? To be somebody but themselves? They don't. They think that we'll just sit there and take it, like good little boys! That we won't werewolf and go wild!
Social Worker: They don't give a shit about people like you, Arthur. And they really don't give a shit about people like me either.
Arthur Fleck: I know it seems strange, I don't mean to make you uncomfortable. I don't know why everyone is so rude; I don't know why you are. I don't want anything from you. Maybe a little but of warmth, maybe a hug, dad? How about just a little bit of fucking decency!
Arthur Fleck: Comedy is subjective, Murray, isn't that what they say? All of you, the system that knows so much: you decide what's right or wrong the same way you decide what's funny or not.
Arthur Fleck: I haven't been happy one minute of my entire fucking life.
Sophie Dumond: Were you following me today?
Arthur Fleck: Yeah.
Sophie Dumond: I thought that was you. I was hoping you'd come in and rob the place.
Arthur Fleck: I have a gun. I could come by tomorrow?
Sophie Dumond: You're so funny, Arthur.
Arthur Fleck: I had a bad day.
Arthur Fleck: I don't want you worrying about money, mom. Or me. Everybody's telling me that my stand-up's ready for the big clubs.
Arthur Fleck: She always tells me to smile, and put on a happy face.
Sophie Dumond: Your name's Arthur, right? You live down the hall. I really need you to leave, my little girl's sleeping in the other room. Please...
Arthur Fleck: Knock knock.
Murray Franklin: Who's there?
Arthur Fleck: It's the police, ma'am! Your son's been hit by a drunk driver. He's dead!
Thomas Wayne: What kind of coward would do something that cold blooded? Someone who hides behind a mask. Someone who is envious of those more fortunate than themselves, yet they're too scared to show their own face. And until those kinds of people change for the better, those of us who made something of our lives will always look at those who haven't as nothing but clowns.
Arthur Fleck: I just hope my death make more cents than my life.
Arthur Fleck: Do I look like the kind of clown that can start a movement?
Arthur Fleck: I don't want you worrying about money mom, or me.
Arthur Fleck: You're awful, Murray.
Murray Franklin: Me? I'm awful? How am I awful?
Arthur Fleck: Playing my video. Inviting me on the show. You just wanted to make fun of me. You're just like the rest of them!
Murray Franklin: All that sacrifice, she must love you very much.
Penny Fleck: I mean, dont you have to be funny to be a comedian?
Arthur Fleck: I've got nothing left to lose. Nothing can hurt me anymore. My life is nothing but comedy.
Arthur Fleck: I just don't want to feel so bad anymore.
Arthur Fleck: Good night. And always remember... That's li...
Thomas Wayne: Touch my son again and I'll fucking kill you!
Arthur Fleck: You know, I do stand-up comedy. You should maybe come see a show sometime.
Sophie Dumond: I could do that.
Arthur Fleck: Gary?
Gary: Yeah?
Arthur Fleck: You were the only one who was ever nice to me.
Arthur Fleck: Get out.
Murray Franklin: And finally, in a world where everyone thinks they could do my job, we got this video tape from Pogo's Comedy Club right here in Gotham. Here's a guy who thinks if you just keep laughing, it'll somehow make you funny. Check out this joker.
Murray Franklin: Do I understand that you did this to start a movement? To become a symbol?
Arthur Fleck: Oh come on, Murray. Do I look like the kind of clown that could start a movement? I killed those guys because they were awful. Everybody is awful these days. It's enough to make everyone crazy.
Murray Franklin: Okay, so that's it? You're crazy, that's your defence for killing three young men?
Arthur Fleck: No. They couldn't carry a tune to save their lives.
Penny Fleck: I never heard him crying, he's always been such a happy little boy.
Thomas Wayne: You think this is funny?
Arthur Fleck: Dad, it's me! Come on!
Murray Franklin: Look what happened because of what you did, what it led to! There are riots out there! Two policemen are in critical condition...
Murray Franklin: ...You're laughing. You're laughing. Someone was killed today because of what you did.
Arthur Fleck: I know.
Arthur Fleck: ...I had a bad day.
Arthur Fleck: I feel like I know you... I've been watching you forever.
Murray Franklin: What's with the face? I mean, are you part of the protest?
Arthur Fleck: No. No, I don't believe any of that. I don't believe in anything.
Arthur Fleck: You're just like the rest of 'em!
Murray Franklin: You don't know the first thing about me, pal. look at what happened because of you did. what it led to. there are riots out there, two police men are in critical condition- you're laughing, you're laughing. someone was killed today because of what you did.
Arthur Fleck: I Know!
Boy's Mother: Would you please stop bothering my kid?
Thomas Wayne: Gotham's lost its way.
Open Mic Comic: I think most women look at sex like buying a car. You know, like, "Can I see myself in this long term?" "Is it safe?" "Is it reliable?" "Could it kill me?" Most guys look at sex like parking a car. We're like, "There's a spot". "There is another spot, that would work." "Oh, I have to pay? - Never mind." "Handicapped? - Hope no one sees us."
Arthur Fleck: When I was a little boy and told people I was going to be a comedian, everyone laughed at me. Well, no one's laughing now.
Gary: What the fuck, Arthur?
Card: Forgive my Laughter: I have a Condition.
Social Worker: How does it feel to have to come here? Does it help to have someone to talk to?
Social Worker: Arthur, you're on seven different medications. Surely they must be doing something.
Sophie Dumond: This building is awful, isn't it?
Detective Garrity: Mr. Fleck? Sorry to bother you. I'm Detective Garrity. This is my partner, Detective Burke. We had a few questions for you, but you weren't home. So, we spoke with your mother.
Thomas Wayne: What kind of coward would do something that cold-blooded? Someone who hides behind a mask?
