Emma: But I have infinite tenderness for you. I always will. My whole life.
Adèle: I miss you. I miss not touching each other. Not seeing each other, not breathing in each other. I want you. All the time. No one else.
Emma: Why are you lying?
Adèle: I'm not lying.
Emma: Then why are you crying?
Adèle: I'm not crying.
Adèle: I am happy. I'm happy with you, like this. It's my way of being happy.
Emma: Enjoying philosophy?
Adèle: I love it. It's incredibly enriching. Very interesting. Very deep. Orgasm precedes essence.
Emma: Your grade better be good.
Adèle: Give me a grade.
Emma: Fourteen.
Adèle: Fourteen? Just fourteen?
Emma: You still need some practice.
Adèle: I'll give it all I've got.
Emma: Something to say?
Adèle: I don't know.
Emma: What?
Adèle: I wanted to know, when was the first time you tasted...
Emma: Tasted a sausage?
Adèle: Tasted a girl.
Emma: A girl? You mean kiss or taste?
Adèle: Kiss. To start with, then we'll see.
Emma: I was fourteen. Sometime around then. There was a party, all the girls had guys. I went out with Louise - that was her name, Louise. We didn't kiss at the party, but... I invited her to sleep over. That's when we kissed.
Adèle: Have you always preferred girls?
Emma: I tried both. I dated guys, girls, and I realized I preferred girls. For sure.
Emma: "Existence precedes essence."
Adèle: He's not the problem. I'm missing something. I'm all messed up. I'm crazy.
Emma: I was big on Sartre in high school.
Adèle: Really?
Emma: It did me good. Especially in affirming my freedom and my own values. And the rigorousness of his commitments. I agree with it.
Adèle: Sort of like Bob Marley. Almost.
Emma: I'm not so sure of it.
Adèle: I'm almost sure of it. Their ideas are similar. You know "Get Up, Stand Up"?
Emma: Yeah I know it.
Adèle: He's committed.
Emma: It's true.
Adèle: Same as Sartre. A philosopher, a prophet, same thing.
Emma: Nothing happens by chance.
Adèle: You don't love me anymore?
Emma: It's nice here.
Adèle: Emma: A little too nice?
Adèle: I guess so.
Valentin: What the hell?
Adèle: Why tell everyone we went to a gay bar? Why the fuck would you do that?
Valentin: It's not the end of the world...
Adèle: It is! They all think I'm a lesbian, eat pussy, and check out her ass!
Emma: What's your name?
Adèle: Adèle.
Emma: Pretty name, Adèle.

Emma: Sun.
Emma: Hope.
Emma: Love.
Adèle: It means justice.
Emma: You still need some practice.
Adèle: I'll give it all I've got.
Mère Emma: Shall we toast?
