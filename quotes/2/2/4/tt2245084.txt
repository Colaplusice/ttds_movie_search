Baymax: : Balalalala
Go Go: There are no red lights in a car chase!
Baymax: I am not fast.
Baymax: On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your pain?
Hiro: Zero.
Baymax: It is alright to cry.
Hiro: No! No, no, no, no, no!
Baymax: Crying is a natural response to pain.
Hiro: I'm not crying.
Baymax: I will scan you for injuries.
Hiro: DON'T scan me.
Baymax: Scan complete.
Hiro: Unbelievable.
Baymax: You have sustained no injuries. However, your hormone and neurotransmitter levels indicate that you are experiencing mood swings, common in adolescence. Diagnosis: puberty.
Hiro: Whoa, what?
Baymax: Hello. I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.
Hiro: Uh, hey... Bay-Baymax, I didn't know you were still... active.
Baymax: I heard a sound of distress. What seems to be the trouble?
Hiro: Oh, I just stubbed my toe a little. I'm fine.
Baymax: On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your pain?
Hiro: A zero? I'm-I'm okay, really. Thanks. You can shrink now.
Baymax: Does it hurt when I touch it?
Hiro: No, no, no, that's okay. No touching. I'm fine...
Baymax: You have fallen.
Hiro: Ya think?
Hiro: We didn't set out to be superheroes. But sometimes life doesn't go the way you planned. The good thing is, my brother wanted to help a lot of people and that's what we're gonna do. Who are we?
Hiro: I can't lose you too!
Fred: Dad, I just wish I could share my accomplishments with you. You mean so much to me and, honestly I've always felt a distance, what with you being on the family island all the time and I just wish you could see how-
Fred's Dad: Fred.
Fred's Dad: Son.
Fred: Dad.
Fred's Dad: I wear 'em front. I wear 'em back.
Fred,Â Fred's Dad: I go inside out. Then I go front and back.
Fred: Dad!
Fred's Dad: We have a *lot* to talk about!
Baymax: I have some concerns.
Hiro: Honey Lemon? Go Go? Wasabi?
Wasabi: I spilled wasabi on my shirt one time, people. ONE TIME!
Tadashi: Fred's the one who comes up with the nicknames.
Hiro: Uh, who's Fred?
Fred: This guy! Right here!
Fred: Uh-uh! Don't be alarmed.
Fred: It's just a suit. This is not my real face and body.
Fred: The name's Fred. School mascot by day. But by night...
Fred: I am also the school mascot.
Hiro: So what's your major?
Fred: No, no, no. I'm not a student. But I am a MAJOR science enthusiast.
Fred: I've been trying to get Honey to develop a formula that can turn me into a fire-breathing lizard at will. But she says that's, "not science."
Honey Lemon: It's-it's really not.
Fred: Yeah. And I guess the shrink ray I asked Wasabi for isn't "science" either, is it?
Wasabi: Nope.
Fred: Well then, what about, invisible sandwich? Imagine eating a sandwich, but everyone just thinks you're crazy!
Wasabi: Just stop.
Baymax: Tadashi is here.
Tadashi: You better make this up to Aunt Cass before she eats everything in the cafe.
Hiro: For sure.
Tadashi: And I hope you learned your lesson, bonehead.
Hiro: Absolutely.
Tadashi: You're going bot fighting, aren't you?
Hiro: There's a fight across town! If I book, I can still make it!
Tadashi: WHEN are you going to do something with that big brain of yours?
Hiro: What? Go to college like you? So people can tell me stuff I already know?
Tadashi: Unbelievable.
Hiro: Okay. If my aunt asks, we were at school all day. Got it?
Baymax: We jumped out a window!
Hiro: No! Quiet! Shhh!
Baymax: Shhh! We jumped out a window!
Hiro: You can't say things like that around Aunt Cass. Shhh!
Baymax: Shhh!
Baymax: Shhh!
Cass: Hiro? You home, sweetie?
Hiro: Uh, that's right.
Cass: I thought I heard you. Hi.
Hiro: H-Hey, Aunt Cass.
Cass: Oh, look at my little college man. Oh, I can't wait to hear all about it! Oh, and wings are almost ready.
Baymax: Weeee!
Hiro: Will you be quiet!
Cass: Yeah, weeee! Weeooh!
Cass: All right, get ready to have your face melted! You are gonna feel these things tomorrow, you know what I'm saying? Okay, sit down, tell me everything.
Hiro: Um, the thing is, since I registered so late, I've got a lot of school stuff to catch up on.
Cass: What was that?
Hiro: Mochi. Ooh, that darn cat!
Cass: Well, at least take a plate for the road, okay?
Cass: Don't work too hard.
Hiro: Thanks for understanding.
Baymax: Hairy baby! Hairy baaaby!
Hiro: All right, come on.
Baymax: Health care, your pers... personal Baymax companion.
Hiro: One foot in front of the other.
Fred: Ah, welcome to mi casa! It's French for 'front door'.
Honey Lemon: It's really... not.
Baymax: Flying makes me a better care provider.
Fred: Hiro, if I could have any superpower right now, it would be the ability to crawl through this camera and give you a big hug.
Wasabi: Why is he trying to kill us?
Wasabi: Um, why are you trying to kill us?
Fred: It's classic villain. We've seen too much!
Honey Lemon: Let's not jump to conclusions. We don't KNOW he's trying to kill us.
Fred: CAR!
Honey Lemon: HE'S TRYING TO KILL US!
Fred: Six intrepid friends, led by Fred, their leader, Freeeeed! Fred's Angels, mm-mm-mm! Fred's Angels, mm-mm-mm! Harnessing the power of the sun with the ancient amulet they found in the attic! Mmm-m-mm! The amulet is green! Mmm-m-mm! It's prob'ly an emerald...
Wasabi: Fred? I will LASER-HAND you in the face!
Wasabi: My brain hates my eyes for seeing this.
Honey Lemon: WOO! Now THAT'S a chemical reaction!
Tadashi: Wow, a lot of sweet tech here today. How are you feeling?
Hiro: You're talking to an ex-bot fighter. Takes a lot more than this to rattle me.
Go Go: Yep, he's nervous.
Fred: Oh, you have nothing to fear, little fella.
Honey Lemon: He's so tense.
Hiro: No, I'm not!
Honey Lemon: Relax, Hiro. Your tech is amazing. Tell him, Go Go.
Go Go: Stop whining. Woman up.
Hiro: I'm fine!
Wasabi: What do you need, little man? Deodorant, breath mint, fresh pair of underpants?
Go Go: Underpants? You need serious help.
Wasabi: Hey, I come prepared.
Fred: I haven't done laundry in six months. One pair lasts me four days. I go front, I go back, I go inside out, then I go front and back.
Tadashi: Wow, that is both disgusting and awesome.
Go Go: Don't encourage him.
Fred: It's called recycling.
Hiro: People keep saying he's not really gone, as long as we remember him. But it still hurts.
Hiro: I am never taking the bus again.
Hiro: Ow!
Baymax: On a scale of 1 to...
Hiro: Ow!
Baymax: On a scale...
Hiro: Ah!
Baymax: On a sca...
Hiro: Oh!
Baymax: On a scale of 1 to 10...
Hiro: Ohhh!
Baymax: On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain?
Hiro: Ahem, zero.
Baymax: Oh, no.
Hiro: I don't know... We don't know anything about him.
Baymax: His blood type is AB negative, Cholesterol levels are...
Hiro: Baymax, you scanned him?
Baymax: I am programmed to assess everyone's health care needs.
Hiro: YES, I can use the data from your scan to find him!
Fred: Super jump! Gravity crush!
Fred: Falling hard!
Hiro: Actually, if we're going to catch this guy, I need to upgrade all of you.
Wasabi: Upgrade who now?
Baymax: Those that suffer a loss require support from friends and loved ones.
Fred: Oh-ho yeah, I like where this is heading...
Wasabi: We can't go up against that guy! We're nerds!
Honey Lemon: Hiro, we want to help, but we're just... us.
Hiro: No. You can be WAY more!
Go Go: Welcome to the nerd lab.
Hiro: Yeah.
Hiro: I've never seen electro-mag suspension on a bike before.
Go Go: Zero resistance, faster bike.
Go Go: But not fast enough.
Go Go: Yet.
Baymax: On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your pain?
Hiro: Physical?
Hiro: Or emotional?
Hiro: Professor Callaghan, let him go! Is this what Abigail would have wanted?
Robert Callaghan: Abigail is GONE!
Hiro: This won't change anything. Trust me. I know.
Alistair Krei: Listen to the kid, Callaghan. Please, l-let me go. I'll give you anything you want!
Robert Callaghan: I want my daughter back!
Hiro: Vinyl?
Tadashi: Yeah. I'm going for a non-threatening... huggable kinda thing.
Hiro: Looks like a walking marshmallow.
Hiro: No offense.
Baymax: I am a robot. I cannot be offended.
Go Go: Killer view!
Wasabi: Yeah, if I wasn't terrified of heights, I'd probably love this. But I'm terrified of heights, so I don't love it!
Hiro: Megabot, destroy.
Wasabi: Quarantine? Do you guys know what quarantine means?
Baymax: Quarantine: Enforced isolation to prevent contamination that could lead to injury, or in some cases, death.
Wasabi: Oh, and uh, this one has a skull face on it. A SKULL FACE!
Ringleader: Two bots enter; one bot leaves.
Baymax: Hiro?
Hiro: You gave me a heart attack!
Baymax: My hands are equipped with defibrillators.
Baymax: Clear.
Hiro: STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP! It's just an expression!
Hiro: It's over, Krei.
Hiro: P-Professor Callaghan? The explosion... you died.
Robert Callaghan: No. I had your microbots.
Hiro: But... Tadashi... You just let him die...
Robert Callaghan: Give me the mask, Hiro.
Hiro: He went in there to SAVE you!
Robert Callaghan: That was HIS mistake!
Hiro: Baymax... destroy!
Baymax: My programming prevents me from injuring a human being.
Hiro: Not anymore.
Baymax: Hiro, this is not what...
Hiro: Do it, Baymax! Destroy him!
Ringleader: The winner, by total annihilation - Yamaaaa!
Yama: Who's next? Who has the guts to step into the ring, with Little Yama...
Hiro: Can I try? I have a robot. I built it myself.
Yama: Hiro: Wow, that's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.
Honey Lemon: Five hundred POUNDS of it! C'mere c'mere c'mere, you're gonna LOVE this! A dash of perchloric acid, a smidgen of cobalt, a hint of hydrogen peroxide, SUPER HEATED TO FIVE HUNDRED KELVIN, and...
Honey Lemon: TADAAA! Pretty great, huh?
Hiro: So... pink.
Honey Lemon: Here's the best paaart!
Hiro: Whoa!
Honey Lemon: I know, right? Chemical metal embrittlement!
Honey Lemon: No, don't push us away, Hiro. We're here for you.
Honey Lemon: Oh, my gosh! You must be Hiro! I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOU!
Baymax: Excuse me while I let out some air.
Hiro: It's over, Krei.
Hiro: Pro... Professor Callaghan? The explosion... you died.
Robert Callaghan: No. I had your microbots.
Hiro: But... Tadashi... You just let him die...
Robert Callaghan: Give me the mask, Hiro.
Hiro: He went in there and saved you...!
Robert Callaghan: That was his mistake!
Hiro: Baymax... destroy.
Baymax: My programming prevents me from injuring a human being.
Hiro: Not anymore.
Baymax: Hiro, this is not what...
Hiro: Do it, Baymax! Destroy him!
