Bing Bong: You made it! Go! Go save Riley!
Bing Bong: Take her to the moon for me. Okay?
Sadness: Crying helps me slow down and obsess over the weight of life's problems.
Sadness: It's long term memory... you'll get lost in there.
Joy: C'mon! Think positive!
Sadness: Okay...
Sadness: I'm positive that you'll get lost in there!
Anger: Anger: Congratulations San Francisco, you've ruined pizza! First the Hawaiians, and now YOU!
Joy: Oh no! These Facts and Opinions look so similar!
Bing Bong: Don't worry about it. Happens all the time.
Bing Bong: Whoa. Is this Riley?
Bing Bong: She's so big now. She won't fit in my rocket. How're we gonna get to the moon?"
Joy: Oh, it's that time in the twisty tree, remember? The hockey team showed up and Mom and Dad were there cheering. Look at her, having fun and laughing. It's my favorite.
Sadness: I love that one, too.
Joy: Atta girl! Now you're getting it!
Sadness: Yeah, it was the day the Prairie Dogs lost the big playoff game. Riley missed the winning shot. She felt awful. She wanted to quit. Sorry, I went sad again, didn't I?
Riley: School was great, all right?
Fear: What was that? I though you said we were gonna "act casual".
Mom: Riley! Is everything okay?
Father's Fear: Sir, she just rolled her eyes at us!
Father's Anger: All right, make a show of force, I don't want to have to put the foot down.
Father's Fear: No! Not the foot...
Dad: Riley, I do not like this new attitude.
Anger: Oh, I'll show you attitude, old man!
Fear: No! no, no! Stay happy!
Riley: What is your problem? Just leave me alone!
Mother's Sadness: Sir, reporting high levels of sass!
Father's Anger: Take it to DEFCON 2!
Riley: DEFCON 2!
Dad: I don't know where this disrespectful attitude came from.
Anger: You want a piece of this, Pops?
Riley: Yeah, well...
Father's Anger: Prepare the foot!
Father's Fear: Keys to safety position!
Father's Fear: Ready to launch on your command, sir!
Riley: Just shut up!
Father's Anger: Fire!
Dad: That's it! Go to your room!
Father's Fear: The foot is down. The foot is down. Whoo!
Father's Anger: Good job, gentleman. That could have been a disaster.
Mother's Sadness: Well, that was a disaster.
Sadness: I'm too sad to walk. Just give me a few... hours.
Fear: All right! We did not die today, I call that an unqualified success.
Fear: Maybe it was a bear?
Disgust: There are no bears in San Francisco.
Anger: I saw a really hairy guy, he looked like a bear.
Bing Bong: Come on, group hug! You too, Anger.
Anger: Don't touch me.
Clown's Joy: Six years of drama school... for this.
Riley: I... I know you don't want me to, but... I miss home. I miss Minnesota. You need me to be happy, but I want my old friends, and my hockey team. I wanna go home. Please don't be mad.
Mom: Oh, sweetie...
Dad: We're not mad. You know what? I miss Minnesota too. I miss the woods where we took hikes.
Mom: And the backyard where we used to play.
Dad: Spring Lake, where you used to skate.
Dad: Come here.
Disgust: It's Joy!
Anger: Stand back!
Disgust: That worked.
Anger: Well, what would you do if you're so smart?
Disgust: I'd tell you, but you're too dumb to understand.
Anger: WHAT?
Disgust: Of course your tiny brain is confused. Guess I'LL just have to dumb it down to your level!
Disgust: Sorry I don't speak moron as well as you, but lemme try! Duuuuuhhhhhh!
Anger: ARRRRRRRRRRHHHHHHHHHHH!
Dad: Here we go. All right, open.
Joy: Hmm... this looks new.
Fear: Think it's safe?
Sadness: What is it?
Disgust: Okay, caution, there is a dangerous smell, people. Hold on, what is that? That is not brightly colored or shaped like a dinosaur, hold on guys... it's... broccoli!
Riley: Yukee!
Disgust: Well, I just saved our lives. Yeah, you're welcome.
Dad: Riley, if you don't eat your dinner you're not gonna get any dessert.
Anger: Wait, did he just say we couldn't have dessert?
Anger: So that's how you wanna play it, old man? No dessert? Oh sure, we'll eat our dinner, right after you eat THIS!
Riley: Dad: Riley, Riley, here comes an airplane.
Anger: Oh, airplane. We got an airplane, everybody.
Joy, Fear, Sadness, Disgust: Ooooh!
Joy: Hey, look! The Golden Gate Bridge! Isn't that great? It's not made out of solid gold like we thought, which is kind of a disappointment, but still!
Fear: I sure am glad you told me earthquakes are a myth, Joy. Otherwise I'd be terrified right now!
Joy: Uh... yeah...
Joy: Do you ever look at someone and wonder, "What is going on inside their head?" Well, I know. Well, I know Riley's head.
Mind Worker Cop Jake: So, you're saying your husband was blown away by an elephant. Was he with anyone?
Cloud Woman: Yes! And there she is!
Mind Worker Cop Jake: Hey, come back here!
Mind Worker Cop: Forget it, Jake.
Mind Worker Cop: It's Cloudtown.
Anger: Can I say that curse word now?
Anger: We should lock the door and scream that curse word we know. It's a good one!
Disgust: What's "poo-ber-tee"?
Bing Bong: Joy? Joy, what are you doing, would ya stop it, please?
Bing Bong: DON'T YA GET IT JOY? WE'RE STUCK DOWN HERE! We're forgotten...
Riley: We... used to play tag... and stuff...
Riley: But... everything is different now. Since we moved...
Joy: Do you remember how she used to stick her tongue out when she was colouring?
Joy: I could listen to her stories, all day...
Joy: I just wanted Riley to be happy...
Sadness: It was the day the Prairie Dogs lost the big playoff game. Riley missed the winning shot, she felt awful. She wanted to quit.
Joy: Sadness... Mom and Dad... the team. They came to help... because of Sadness.
Joy: It was amazing! Just Riley and me, forever.
Joy: Um, for thirty-three seconds.
Sadness: I'm Sadness.
Joy: Oh, hello! Uh, I'm Joy. So, could I just... If you could... I just wanna fix that. Thanks.
Joy: And that was just the beginning! Headquarters only got more crowded from there.
Fear: Let me guess, we have no pants on.
Girl: Hey look! She came to school with no pants on!
Fear: Called it!
Joy: Do you remember how she used to stick her tongue out when she was colouring?
Joy: I could listen to her stories, all day.
Joy: I just wanted Riley to be happy...
Sadness: Aww, participation award.
Bing Bong: D, A, N, G, E, R, SHORTCUT!
Sadness: Remember the funny movie where the dog died?
Riley: Sorry.
Riley: Uh... Okay. Bye.
Disgust: I'm Joy, this is Sadness, that's Anger, this is Disgust.
Disgust: Ugh...
Joy: And that's Fear.
Fear: Ahhh! Look out!
Anger: Wait a minute. WAIT A MINUTE!
Anger: AH-HA! Ho ho ho!
Fear: What is it?
Anger: Oh nothing. Just the best idea ever!
Disgust: What?
Anger: All the good core memories were made in Minnesota. Ergo, we go back to Minnesota and make more. TA DA!
Fear: Wait wait wait, you're saying we... run away?
Anger: Well, I wouldn't call it that, I'd call it the "Happy Core Memory Development Program"!
Fear: You can't be serious!
Anger: Hey! Our life was perfect until Mom and Dad decided to move to... San Fran-Stinktown!
Fear: But... But I mean, it's just so drastic...
Anger: Need I remind you of how great things were there?
Anger: Our room... Our backyard... Our friends!
Anger: DID I ASK FOR THE GUM COMMERCIAL?
Anger: Anyway, it was better, that's my point.
Joy: Hello! Did I wake you?
Anger: Did you have to play that?
Joy: Well, I have to practice. And I don't think of it as playing so much as hugging.
Joy: Okay, first day of school! Very, very exciting! I was up late last night figuring out a new plan. Here it is.
Joy: Fear! I need a list of all the possible negative outcomes on the first day at a new school.
Fear: Way ahead of you there. Does anyone know how to spell "meteor?"
Joy: Disgust! Make sure Riley stands out today... but also blends in.
Disgust: When I'm through, Riley will look so good the other kids will look at their own outfits and barf.
Joy: Joy!
Joy: Yes, Joy?
Joy: You'll be in charge of the console, keeping Riley happy all day long. And may I add I love your dress, it's adorable.
Joy: Oh, This ol' thing? Thank you so much, I love the way it twirls...
Additional Voices: Eat us! We're organic!
Joy: Hey! Hey, look at me. Did you mean what you said before?
Riley's Imaginary Boyfriend: I would die for Riley. I would die for Riley.
Joy: Yeah, yeah, okay, haircut. Time to prove it!
Fear: Hey, I'm liking this new view.
Anger: Friendship Island has expanded. Glad they finally opened that Friendly Argument section.
Sadness: I like Tragic Vampire Romance Island.
Disgust: Fashion Island? Oh, everyone shut up.
Fear: Boy Band Island? Hope that's just a phase.
Joy: Say what you want, I think it's all beautiful.
Fritz: All right. Here you go. Your new expanded console is up and runnin'.
Disgust: Cool! Upgrade!
Fear: Hey!
Fear: Whoops, wait. Did I just do that?
Disgust: Hey, guys? What's pub-er-ty?
Joy: I don't know. It's probably not important.
Anger: Whoa, I have access to the entire curse word library! This new console is the - -!
Fear: Sorry. I did it again. My bad.
Anger: This is ridiculous! We can't even get a good night's sleep anymore. Time to take action!
Anger: Stupid Mom and Dad. If they hadn't moved us, none of this would have happened. Who's with me?
Fear: Um... mmmmmmmmm... Nnnnnnnn... no.
Disgust: ...Yeah, okay. Let's do it.
Anger: She took it. There is no turning back.
Disgust: So... how are we going to get to Minnesota from here?
Anger: Well, why don't we go down to the elephant lot and rent an elephant?
Fear: Hey! That sounds nice!
Anger: WE'RE TAKING THE BUS, NITWIT!
Anger: There is a bus leaving tomorrow. Perfect!
Disgust: A ticket costs money. How do we get money?
Anger: Mom's purse.
Disgust: You wouldn't!
Anger: Oh, but I would. Where was it we saw it last?
Anger: NO!
Anger: These are my kind of people!
Disgust: Okay, we've got a group of cool girls at 2 o'clock.
Joy: How do you know?
Disgust: Double ears pierced, infinity scarf.
Joy: Whoa, is she wearing eye shadow?
Disgust: Yeah, we wanna be friends with them.
Joy: Let's go talk to them.
Disgust: Are you kidding? We're not talking to them. We want them to like us!
Joy: Oh, yeah. Wait, what?
Joy: We've been through a lot lately, that's for sure. But we still love our girl. She has great new friends, a great new house. Things couldn't be better. After all, Riley's twelve now. What could happen?
Mom: Your dad's under a lot of pressure, but if you and I can keep smiling, it would be a big help. We can do that for him. Right?
Joy: This is a really bad idea! No, Joy. Think positive...
Joy: I'm positive this is crazy!
Joy: Sadness! Sadness? Come on, Sadness, where are you? Okay, if I were Sadness, where would I be?
Joy: Oh, everything is awful, and my legs don't work, and you have to drag me around while I touch all the...
Fear: What was that? Was it a bear? It's a bear!
Disgust: There are no bears in San Francisco!
Anger: I saw a really hairy guy. He looked like a bear.
Fear: Oh, I'm so jumpy, my nerves are shot!
Disgust: Ew, I don't want to hear about your nerves!
Anger: I'll tell you what it is. This move has been a bust.
Fear: That's what I've been telling you guys! There are at least 37 things for Riley to be scared of right now!
Disgust: The smell alone is enough to make her gag.
Anger: I can't believe Mom and Dad moved us here!
Joy: Look, I get it. You guys have concerns. But we've been through worse! Tell you what: let's make a list of all the things Riley should be HAPPY about!
Anger: Fine. Let's see... this house stinks, our room stinks...
Disgust: Pizza is weird here...
Sadness: Our friends are back home...
Fear: And all of our stuff is in the missing van!
Joy: Oh c'mon, it could be worse...
Disgust: Yeah, Joy. We could be lying on the dirty floor. In a bag.
Joy: Okay, I admit it, we had a rough start. But think of all the good things that...
Anger: No, Joy. There's absolutely no reason for Riley to be happy right now. Let us handle this.
Fear: I say we skip school tomorrow and lock ourselves in the bedroom.
Disgust: We have no clean clothes. I mean, no one should see us.
Sadness: Yeah, we could cry until we can't breathe.
Anger: We should lock the door and scream that curse word we know. It's a good one!
Subconscious Guard Frank: My hat feels loose.
Subconscious Guard Dave: L, let me see.
Subconscious Guard Frank: You got my hat? or, or is that your hat?
Subconscious Guard Dave: Yeah, It's my hat.
Subconscious Guard Frank: You sure? I don't know, look in the label.
Subconscious Guard Dave: Yeah it says "My hat".
Subconscious Guard Frank: Wait, it, it says "My hat"?
Subconscious Guard Dave: "My hat" it says.
Subconscious Guard Frank: That's what I wrote in my hat.
Subconscious Guard Dave: What are you talking about?
Subconscious Guard Frank: You've got my hat on.
Subconscious Guard Dave: Okay, but it's my handwriting.
Subconscious Guard Dave: Okay, but, it's my handwriting.
Subconscious Guard Frank: No it isn't. That's my handwrit... I wrote that!
Subconscious Guard Dave: No, but this one's my handwriting.
Mom: The drive out was pretty fun. What was your favourite bit?
Anger: Spitting out the car window!
Disgust: Definitely not when Dad was singing.
Fear: Wearing a seat belt!
Disgust: Whoa, no way! We are not eating that.
Joy: Disgust, it's fine. It passed the five-second rule.
Disgust: The grape touched the ground. It's poison.
Joy: Oh, come on. It barely touched the ground.
Disgust: Wait, what? You know what else 'barely' touches the ground? Stray dogs!
Joy: Hold on!
Disgust: Toenail clippings! Roadkill! Hippies!
Joy: No!
Disgust: Dung beetles!
Joy: Stop it!
Fear: Uh, shouldn't we do something?
Anger: Haha, no.
Joy: It's a *grape*! It's not like we're eating broccoli.
Disgust: Ugh, don't even go there.
Joy: Or boogers.
Disgust: You're evil!
Joy: Or dog food.
Disgust: Shut your mouth!
Cool Girl's Emotions: Being cool is exhausting.
Bing Bong: We're taking the Train of Thought.
Joy: The Train! Of course. That is so much faster, but how do we catch it?
Bing Bong: Well, it kind of goes all over the place.
Sadness: I'm sorry they took your rocket. They took something you loved.
Bing Bong: It's gone. Forever.
Joy: Sadness! Don't make him feel worse!
Sadness: Sorry.
Bing Bong: It's all I had left of Riley.
Sadness: I bet you and Riley had great adventures.
Bing Bong: Oh, they were wonderful. Once we flew back in time. We had breakfast twice that day.
Joy: Sadness!
Sadness: It sounds amazing. I bet Riley liked it.
Bing Bong: She did. We were best friends.
Sadness: Yeah. It's sad.
Bing Bong: I'm okay now. Come on. The train station is this way.
Jangles: Who's the birthday girl?
Bing Bong: I blow a mean nose.
Translated Subtitle: I smell food.
Translated Subtitle: The man has food.
Translated Subtitle: Get the food.
