Kujuro Hirayama: No mercy! There's no samurai code or fair play in battle! No sword? Use a stick. No stick? Use a rock. No rock? Use your fists and feet! Lose your life, but make the enemy pay!
Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira: Ruling is convenient, but only for rulers. The people must live to serve.
Hanbei Kitou: Who are you? You're no samurai.
Koyata: So what? Do only samurai matter in this world? I thought samurai would be fun but you bore me. You're useless, even more useless in great numbers.
Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira: This man speaks the truth. His reward is my short sword.
Saheita Kuranaga: I presume you are the Akashi entourage of Lord Naritsugu. By the order of His Shogun's subject Shinzaemon, we commemorate your passage with arrows!
Shinzaemon Shimada: I shall accomplish your task... with magnificence.
Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira: Hanbei?
Hanbei Kitou: Huh?
Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira: You think the age of war was like this?
Hanbei Kitou: Perhaps
Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira: It's magnificent. With death comes gratitude for life. If a man has lived in vain, then how trivial his life is. Oh, Hanbei. Something wonderful has come to my mind.
Hanbei Kitou: Huh?
Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira: Once I'm on the Shogun's council, let's bring the age of war.
Koyata: Compared to fighting a wild bear these wounds are nothing.
Shinzaemon Shimada: He who values his life dies a dog's death.
Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira: Some call it elegance. Some call it cruel. I like it.
Lord Naritsugu Matsudaira: It hurts.
Koyata: Why are you samurai so arrogant?
