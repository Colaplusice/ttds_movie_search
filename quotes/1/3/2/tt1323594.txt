Young Gru: Mom, someday, I'm going to go to the moon.
Gru's Mom: I'm afraid you're too late, son. NASA isn't sending the monkeys anymore.
Agnes: Oh, my gosh look at that fluffy unicorn!
Agnes: He's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!
Gru: Hello, Fred. FYI. Your dog has been leaving little bombs in my yard, and I do not appreciate it.
Fred McDade: Oh you know dogs... they go where they want to go.
Gru: Unless they're dead.
Gru: I'm joking! Although it is true. Anyway, have a good one.
Agnes: Will you read us a bedtime story?
Gru: No.
Agnes: Pretty please?
Gru: The physical appearance of the please makes no difference. It is still no, so go to sleep.
Agnes: Why are you wearing your pajamas?
Vector: These aren't pajamas! It's a warm-up suit.
Edith: What are you warming up for?
Vector: Stuff.
Margo: What sort of stuff?
Vector: Super-cool stuff you wouldn't understand.
Agnes: Like sleeping?
Vector: THEY ARE NOT PAJAMAS!
Edith: Hey, that one looks like me.
Gru: What are you talking about? These are kittens! Any relation to persons living or dead is completely coincidental.
Gru: Uh, question. What are these?
Dr. Nefario: A dozen boogie robots. Boogie! Look at this! Watch me.
Gru: Cookie robots! I said cookie robots! Ah, why... why are you so... old?
Dr. Nefario: And here, of course, is the new weapon you ordered.
Gru: No, no, no. I said *dart* gun, not...
Gru: Okay.
Dr. Nefario: Oh, yes. 'Cause I was wondering... under what circumstances would we use this?
Gru: We stole the Statue of Liberty...!
Gru: ...the small one, from Las Vegas!
Gru: I won't even mention the Eiffel Tower... also Vegas.
Vector: I'm applying for a villain loan. I go by the name of Vector. It's a mathematical term, represented by an arrow with both direction and magnitude. Vector! That's me, because I commit crimes with both direction and magnitude. Oh yeah!
Agnes: I like him. He's nice.
Edith: He's scary.
Agnes: Like Santa.
Gru: Whoa, whoa, whoa! What was that? She hit that. I saw that with my own eyes.
Carnival Barker: Well, you see that little spaceship there? You see how it's not knocked over? Do you know what that means, Professor? It means you don't get the unicorn! Aw. Uh-oh! Somebody's got a frowny face! Ooh. Better luck next time.
Gru: Okay... my turn.
Gru: Knocked over!
Gru: Kyle. These are not treats. These are guests!
Gru: Girls, this is Kyle, my... dog.
Agnes: Ooh, fluffy doggie!
Margo: What kind of dog is that?
Gru: He's a... I don't know.
Margo: Hello? Cookies for sale!
Gru: Go away, I'm not home!
Margo: Uh, yes, you are. I heard you.
Gru: No, you didn't. This... is a recording.
Margo: No, it isn't.
Gru: Yes, it is. Watch this. Leave a message. Beep!
Agnes: Goodbye, recorded message.
Margo: Agnes, come on!
Young Gru: Look, Mom, I drew a picture of me landing on the moon.
Gru's Mom: Eh.
Young Gru: Look, Mom, I made a prototype of a rocket out of macaroni.
Gru's Mom: Eh.
Young Gru: Look, Mom, I built a real rocket based on the macaroni prototype.
Gru's Mom: ... Eh.
Gru: "Three little kittens love to play. They had fun in the sun all day. Then their mother came out and said, 'Time for kittens to go to bed'."
Gru: Wow, this is garbage. You actually like this?
Edith: It was your cousin's idea!
Dave the Minion: *What*?
Edith: Are these beds made out of bombs?
Gru: Yes, but they are very old and highly unlikely to blow up. But try not to toss and turn.
Edith: Cool!
Agnes: Aw. My caterpillar never turned into a butterfly.
Edith: That's a Cheeto.
Agnes: Oh.
Gru: That book was accidentally destroyed maliciously...
Gru: One big unicorn, strong and free, thought he was happy as he could be. Then three little kittens came around and turned his whole life upside down. They made him laugh, they made him cry. He never should have said goodbye. And now he knows he can never part from those three little kittens that changed his heart.
Dr. Nefario: We have to warn him, and FAST!
Agnes: Pinkie promise?
Gru: Oh yes, my pinkie promises.
Gru: We have located a shrink ray in a secret lab. And once we take this shrink ray, we will have the capability to pull off the TRUE crime of the century!
Gru: We... are going to steal...
Gru: Wait, wait! I haven't told you what it is yet.
Gru: Hey. Dave, listen up, please!
Gru: Next, we are going to steal... pause for effect...
Gru: ...THE MOON!
Gru: And once the moon is mine, the world will give me whatever I want to get it back, and I will be the greatest villain of all time! That's what I'M talking 'bout!
Gru: Assemble the minions!
Margo: Oh, uh, can we get stuffed crust?
Edith, Agnes, Jerry the Minion, Stuart the Minion: OOOOHHHH, stuffed crust.
Gru: I'll stuff you all in the crust!
Agnes: You're funny!
Gru: Just don't come out of that room again!
Gru: I went to kindergarten, I know how the alphabet works.
Gru: Clearly we need to set some rules. Rule number one: You will not touch *anything*.
Margo: Aha. What about the floor?
Gru: Yes, you may touch the floor.
Margo: What about the air?
Gru: Yes, you may touch the air.
Edith: What about this?
Gru: Where did you get that?
Edith: Found it.
Gru: Okay, rule number two: You will not bother me while I'm working. Rule number three: You will not cry, or whine, or laugh, or giggle, or sneeze or barf or fart! So no, no, no annoying sounds. All right?
Agnes: Does this count as annoying?
Gru: Very!
Gru: I'll see you in six hours.
Margo: Okay, don't worry. Everything is going to be fine. We're gonna be really happy here. Right...? Agnes?
Agnes: Mmm?
Edith: When we got adopted by a bald guy, I thought this would be more like Annie.
Agnes: Unicorns, I love them. Unicorns, I love them. Uni uni unicorns, I love them. Uni unicorns, I could pet one if they were really real. And they are! So I bought one so I could pet it. Now it loves me, now I love it. La lala la la...
Gru: Okay, bedtime.
Gru: Not you two.
Gru: No, no! Stay away from there! It's fragile!
Gru: Well, I suppose the plan will work with two.
Edith: Hey! It's dark in here!
Edith: It poked a hole in my juice box.
Gru: You are a beautiful woman. Do you speak Spanish?
Miss Hattie: Do I look like I speak Spanish?
Gru: You have a face... Como un burro.
Miss Hattie: Oh! Well, thank you!
Vector: Look at you, a little tiny toilet, for little tiny people to...
Vector: Ah! Curse you, tiny toilet!
Gru: You got to be pulling on my leg!
Gru: This is literature? A two year old could have written this!
Edith: Yes! Mine's shaped like a dead guy!
Agnes: Cool, lets go destroy some other games!
Gru: Hello, Mom. Sorry, I meant to call, but...
Gru's Mom: I just wanted to congratulate you on stealing the pyramid.
Gru's Mom: That was you, wasn't it? Or was it a villain who's actually successful?
Gru: Just so know, Mom. I'm about to do something. It's very very big. Very important, when you hear about it, you're going to be very proud.
Gru's Mom: Good luck with that. Okay, I'm outta here!
Edith: Can I drink this?
Dr. Nefario: Do you want to explode?
Miss Hattie: I'm here for the girls. I recieved a call that you wanted to return them. And also, I did purchase a Spanish dictionary.
Miss Hattie: I didn't like what you said.
Gru: I fly to the moon, I shrink the moon, I grab the moon, I sit on the toi-let what?
Gru: Sorry. Sorry! Could you, uh, excuse me for just one second?
Gru: Did you brush your teeth? Let me smell. Let me smell.
Gru: You did *not*!
Mr. Perkins: Do you know where the shrink ray is?
Vector: Duh? Back at my place.
Mr. Perkins: Oh, is that right? Back at your place? Oh, that's cool. I guess Gru must just have one that LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE IT!
Vector: Oh. What? Th-those girls sold me cookies.
Gru: It's like my heart is a tooth, and it's got a cavity that can only be filled with children.
Dr. Nefario: We've been working on this for a while now. It's an Anti-gravity serum.
Dr. Nefario: I meant to close that. He'll be alright, I'm sure.
Gru: Do the effects wear off?
Dr. Nefario: Uh... so far, no. No, they don't.
Gru: Now the girls.
Vector: Actually, I'm holding on to them a little longer.
Gru: No!
Vector: Oh yeah! Unpredictable!
Agnes: Just one more! I accidentally closed my eyes.
Margo: You gave us back.
Gru: I know, I know, and it is the worst mistake I ever made.
Gru: Light bulb!
Gru: In terms of money, we have no money.
Mr. Perkins: You don't have it? And yet you have the audacity to ask the bank for money?
Gru: Apparently.
Vector: He punched my shark!
Gru: Listen close, you little punk! When I get in there, you are in for a world of pain!
Vector: Ooh, I'm really scared!
Agnes: He is gonna kick your butt.
Gru: So, good night, sleep tight, and don't let the bed bugs bite. Because there are literally thousands of them.
Gru: Oh, and there's probably something in your closet.
Margo: He's just kidding, Agnes.
Vector: Gru?
Vector: Don't make me laugh! And P.S., he is not getting the moon! And P.P.S., when I'm done with Gru, he's gonna be begging for mercy!
Vector: Boo-ya!
Vector: You got shrunk, tiny mouthwash!
Vector: Yeah! You done been shrunk!
Vector: Y'ello? Oh yeah, I got the shrink ray...! What? No, I'm not... playing with it.
Edith: Somebody broke that.
Vector: Oh, poop!
Tourist Mom: Justin!
Tourist Dad: Look honey, take my picture, I have a pyramid in my hands.
Gru: I hate that guy.
Vector: Oh yeaaaaahhh!
Margo: I bet the mom is beautiful!
Edith: I bet the daddy's eyes sparkle!
Agnes: I bet their house is made of gummy bears!
Agnes: I'm just saying it'd be nice.
Margo: And please watch over us, and bless that we'll have a good night's sleep.
Edith: And bless that while we're sleeping, no bugs will crawl into our ears and lay eggs in our brains!
Agnes: Ugh!
Margo: Great. Thanks for that image, Edith.
Agnes: And please bless that someone will adopt us soon, and that the mommy and daddy will be nice... and have a pet unicorn.
Agnes: Amen.
Margo, Edith: Amen.
Gru: Listen close, you little punk. When I get in there, you are in for a world of pain!
Vector: Ooh, I'm really scared!
Agnes: He is gonna kick your butt.
Mr. Perkins: Do you have any idea how lucrative this moon heist could be? I give you the opportunity of a lifetime and you just blow it!
Vector: No... I didn't.
Mr. Perkins: Oh, really?
Vector: Yeah, just wait until Gru sees my latest weapon! Squid launcher! Oh, yeah!
Man: Ah! There's a squid on my face!
Vector: Don't worry. The moon is as good as ours.
Gru: Oh, come on!
Margo: Just so you know, you're never going to be my dad.
Gru: Hmm, I think I can live with that.
Edith: Whoa! That is cool! Come on!
Agnes: I don't think he's a dentist.
Miss Hattie: Now, go clean something of mine.
Margo, Edith, Agnes: Hi, Penny.
Penny: Hi, guys.
