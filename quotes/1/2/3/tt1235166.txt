Reyeb: The idea is to leave here a little smarter.
Ryad: One day I saw a job ad. For security guard. I didn't have a dog, so I bought one secondhand. I didn't know, so I got a rottweiler. Know what they're like? And his name was Tyson. He came with the name Tyson. He was humongous! See this? This was the size of his poops. He took enormous dumps. Bigger than mine. So I work in a store. A big supermarket. I leave the dog to sniff around. I go outside for a cigarette. Then I try to go back in. I couldn't. He didn't always recognize me.
Malik El Djebena: Your own dog?
Ryad: But he was crazy. Tyson was a psycho. I go inside and he comes charging towards me. I panic, reach out my arm. He grabs me like this. I take out my mace, spray him. He lets go. I run out, scared shitless. What do I do? I leave him inside. Soon the employees start coming. I didn't know they used a back door to go inside. The hound had a field day. He tore every last one to pieces.
Lattrache: What's your thing? How do you do it? What are you? A prophet or something?
Malik El Djebena: I did Reyeb.
Lattrache: Fuck, you've come a long way.
Jordi: I like porn set in castles. The girls are fancier, cleaner.
Chef de détention: Any family on the outside?
Malik El Djebena: No, sir.
Chef de détention: No one to wire you money?
Malik El Djebena: No, sir.
Chef de détention: Friends inside, or outside?
Malik El Djebena: No one, sir.
Ryad: What's your sign?
Malik El Djebena: Cancer! I'm just teasing. I'm Aries.
César Luciani: Thatta boy!
Malik El Djebena: Just another Arab thinking with his balls.
Djamila: Where will you live?
Djamila: Come home. I'll take the kid. Use his bedroom.
Malik El Djebena: I don't want to impose.
Djamila: You're not.
Ryad: "We ate" is the past. Now try the subjunctive. "Would... that we ate."
Malik El Djebena: People say that?
Ryad: It's wild. I never did but they do.
Ryad: It was great getting your letter. First, I hear from you. Second, I see you've made a lot of fucking progress. You write like a pro and I'm glad. At least I served a purpose. I can tell you now, it was no piece of cake.
Malik El Djebena: What do you got?
Ryad: Testicle cancer.
Malik El Djebena: Cancer on your balls?
Ryad: Stop shouting! Why not make an announcement?
César Luciani: If you weren't spying, what were you doing? Making fun?
Malik El Djebena: If I was making fun, I'd never have told you.
César Luciani: Fill out a parole application. I'll have it treated in priority. In the meantime, you can go on leave. You go out for me, you come back, and you get paid. What do you say?
Malik El Djebena: What's the risk?
César Luciani: There is no risk. Staying here is the only risk.
Malik El Djebena: If you want a favor, learn to ask.
Hassan: What do you want?
Malik El Djebena: What can I get out of it?
Hassan: Respect.
Malik El Djebena: Do I look Corsican?
César Luciani: If you can walk around this place, it's because I had you made porter. If you eat, it's thanks to me. If you dream, think, live... it's thanks to me!
Vettori: These fucking Arabs! At least dogs fuck in silence.
César Luciani: You're saying I'm going to die alone here.
Sampierro: Don't talk like that. You're not alone. You carry weight outside.
César Luciani: And here?
Jordi: When you get out, what'll you do?
Malik El Djebena: I don't know. You?
Jordi: Same thing as in here, only bigger.
Malik El Djebena: Hash?
Jordi: Yeah, hash. I'll move big loads. Marbella-Paris, three cars. Six hundred kilos each trip.
Jordi: Don't believe me?
Malik El Djebena: No, I'm just trying to picture six hundred kilos.
Jordi: It's like this.
Jordi: You can't see anything behind it.
Sampierro: César said you ask no questions.
Malik El Djebena: César said I'd be paid.
Ryad: You look like a lawyer.
Lattrache: Let's get sucked before you go.
Malik El Djebena: Want to know how I feel?
César Luciani: I couldn't care less.
César Luciani: I'm going to ask a favor of you, not because you work for me, but because I trust you. Understand the difference?
Malik El Djebena: I'm not sure.
Prisoner: Take these handcuffs off!
Reyeb: Happy birthday, brother.
Santi: From César Luciani. You're now under his protection.
Malik El Djebena: Is this necessary?
Lattrache: Doesn't bother me.
