Rex: Does this mean... Woody's a lost toy?
Buzz Lightyear: He's not lost. Not anymore. To infinity...
Woody: ...and beyond.
Forky: I am not a toy, I was made for soups, salads, maybe chili, and then the trash. Freedom!
Buzz Lightyear: She'll be okay. Bonnie will be okay.
Duke Caboom: Do you really have laser eyes?
Bunny: Uh... yeah.
Duke Caboom: Woah.
Woody: Uhhh... this is Forky...
Forky: I'm trash.
Forky: I'M NOT A TOY! AAAH!
Woody: Hey, hey, somebody get him before he pokes an eye out.
Duke Caboom: Yes I Can-ada!
Woody: I was made to help a child, I don't remember it being this hard.
Woody: I want you to meet... Forky.
Mr. Pricklepants: He's a spork.
Trixie: I have a question. No, wait. I have *all* the questions.
Forky: I don't belong here!
Buzz Lightyear: How do we get that key?
Forky: I am not a toy. I am a spork!
Woody: Wow, this place is amazing.
Bo Peep: Wasn't Buzz gonna meet us here?
Forky: Hi. I'm, uh... I'm Forky.
Knifey: T... Trash?
Forky: No, no, *toy*. I am a... We are all toys. Unique, beautiful toys. I will explain everything.
Knifey: How am I alive?
Forky: ...I don't know.
Woody: Ya know, you've handled this lost toy life better than I could.
Bo Peep: Open your eyes, Woody. There's plenty of kids out there. Sometimes change can be good!
Woody: You can't teach this old toy new tricks.
Bo Peep: You'd be surprised.
Rex: The panic is attacking me!
Mr. Potato Head: Hey, watch it.
Bo Peep: Nobody wants this.
Woody: I do.
Bo Peep: Why?
Woody: Because...
Bo Peep: Why?
Woody: Just because...
Bo Peep: Why?
Woody: Because it's all I have left to do!... I don't have anything else...
Bo Peep: So, the rest of us don't count?
Woody: That's - That's not what I meant. Bonnie needs Forky.
Bo Peep: No! *You* need Bonnie! Open your eyes, Woody. There's plenty of kids out there. It can't be just about the one you're still clinging to.
Woody: It's called loyalty. Something a lost toy wouldn't understand!
Bo Peep: I'm not the one that's lost.
Buzz Lightyear: 'To Infinity & Beyond!'
Woody: Buzz, I... I...
Buzz Lightyear: She'll be okay.
Buzz Lightyear: Bonnie, will be okay.
Buzz Lightyear: 'No Time To Explain, Attack!'
Buzz Lightyear: Woody was right, we all should have been safe guarding the utensil.
Trixie: Why isn't Woody back yet?
Rex: Do you think he's lost?
Buttercup: Buzz, what do we do?
Trixie: What Do We Do Buzz? Buzz What Do We Do? What Do We Do Buzz? What Do We Do Buzz? Buzz? Buzz?
Buzz Lightyear: Uh, Well, Uh... I Uh, Well, I, Uh...
Rex: What Would Woody Do?

Buzz Lightyear: What Would Woody Do?
Buzz Lightyear: 'There's A Secret Mission, In Uncharted Space'. I Think I Uh, Have To Go.
Rex: Where?
Slinky Dog: Where ya going? Why?
Buzz Lightyear: 'No Time To Explain, Attack!' No Time To Explain!
Buzz Lightyear: Want me to take the next watch? I'll keep an eye on Forky.
Woody: No, no, I need to do this, that little voice inside me would never leave me alone if I gave up.
Buzz Lightyear: Huh... Who do you think it is?
Woody: Who?
Buzz Lightyear: The voice inside of you, who do you think it is?
Woody: Uh, me? You know, my conscience. The part of you that tells you things, what you're really thinking.
Buzz Lightyear: Fascinating. So your inner voice advises you!
Bo Peep: So, you're... uh... with a kid? It's not Andy, is it?
Woody: No, No, No He Went Off To College, But He Gave Us To Bonnie, Oh She's...
