Álex Ulloa: Who's that?
Mayka Villaverde: Nobody.
Álex Ulloa: Were you talking about me?
Mayka Villaverde: You won't like it. He's my new lawyer.
Álex Ulloa: What's wrong with Gloria?

Mayka Villaverde: Not everyone. You, yes... Got you! You handed that to me on a platter!
Álex Ulloa: It's not funny. If he's not your lawyer, who is he?
Mayka Villaverde: My psychoanalyst.
Álex Ulloa: I didn't know you saw a psychoanalyst.
Mayka Villaverde: There are lots of things you don't know about me...
