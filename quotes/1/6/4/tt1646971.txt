Hiccup: Welcome aboard, dragon rider.
Eret: Thanks! I think!
Astrid: Where have YOU been?
Hiccup: Oh, you know. Catching up with Mom.
Astrid: THAT'S your MOTHER?
Hiccup: Well, now you know where I get my dramatic flair.
Stoick the Vast: Men who kill without reason cannot be reasoned with.
Hiccup: So, what should we name it?
Hiccup: Itchy Armpit it is.
Gobber: May the valkyries welcome you and lead you through Odin's great battlefield. May they sing your name with love and fury, so that we might hear it rise from the depths of Valhalla and know that you've taken your rightful place at the table of kings. For a great man has fallen: A warrior. A chieftain. A father. A friend.
Hiccup: This is Berk. A bit trampled and busted and covered in ice, but it's home. It's our home. Those who attacked us are relentless and crazy, but those who stopped them - oh-h-h-h-h, even more so! We may be small in numbers, but we stand for something bigger than anything the world can pin against us. We are the voice of peace, and, bit by bit, we will change this world. You see, we have something they don't. Oh, sure, they have armies, and they have armadas, but we... we have...
Hiccup: ...OUR DRAGONS!
Hiccup: I'm sorry, Dad. I'm not the chief that you wanted me to be and I'm not the peacekeeper I thought I was. I... don't know...
Valka: You came early into this world. You were such a wee thing. Oh, so frail, so fragile. I feared you wouldn't make it. But your father, he never doubted. He always said you'd become the strongest of them all. And he was right. You have the heart of a chief and the soul of a dragon. Only you can bring our worlds together. That is who you are, son.
Hiccup: I, uh... I was so afraid of becoming my dad. Mostly because I thought I never could. How-how do you become someone that great, that brave, that selfless? I guess you can only try. A chief protects his own. We're going back.
Tuffnut: Uh... with what?
Ruffnut: Uh, he took all the dragons.
Hiccup: Not all of them.
Hiccup: Yep, Berk is pretty much perfect. All of my hard work has paid off. And it's a good thing, too, because, with Vikings on the backs of dragons, the world just got a whole lot bigger.
Hiccup: He's down! Ah, and it's ugly! Dragons and Vikings, enemies again, locked in combat to the bitter...
Hiccup: Ugh! C'mon!
Hiccup: You KNOW that doesn't wash out!
Hiccup: What do you think, bud? You wanna give this another shot?
Hiccup: Toothless! It'll be fine!
Hiccup: This is Berk, the best kept secret this side of, well, anywhere. Granted, it may not look like much, but this wet heap of rock packs more than a few surprises. Life here is amazing, just not for the faint of heart. You see, where most folks enjoy hobbies like whittling or needlepoint, we Berkians prefer a little something we like to call... DRAGON RACING!
Valka: Oh, he's beautiful!
Valka: Incredible! He might very well be the last of his kind. And look!
Valka: He's your age!
Hiccup: Wow.
Valka: No wonder you get along so well!
Valka: And retractable teeth! How did you manage to...?
Hiccup: Oh, I found him in the woods. He was... shot down and wounded.
Valka: This Snafflefang lost his leg to one of Drago Bludvist's iron traps. This Raincutter had her wing sliced by razor netting. And this poor Hobblegrunt was blinded by a tree snare and then left to die alone and scared.
Valka: And what of this? Did Drago or his trappers do this, too?
Hiccup: Oh, yeah. Well, crazy thing is... I'M actually the one who... shot him down.
Hiccup: Hey, it's okay, though! He got me back!
Hiccup: Right, bud? You couldn't save all of me, could you? You just had to make it even. So, peg leg!
Eret: That was some pretty fine dragon-wrangling back there. You'd make a good trapper.
Eret: Whoa!
Hiccup: You know, Skullcrusher's gonna need somebody to look after him now.
Eret: Me?
Eret: I'd be honored.
Valka: Your father would be every bit as proud as I am.
Hiccup: Thank you. I'm really glad you're here, Mom.
Valka: And here I'll stay.
Astrid: See? I told you it was in here.
Hiccup: You're still doing that one. That's hilarious. Come here, you.
Valka: Hiccup?
Hiccup: Eh...
Valka: Could-could it be? After all these years? How is this possible?
Hiccup: Uh, should I... should I know you?
Valka: No. You were only a babe.
Valka: But a mother never forgets.
Hiccup: This is where you've been for twenty years?
Hiccup: You-you've been rescuing them.
Hiccup: Unbelievable.
Valka: You're not upset?
Hiccup: What? No! I... I don't know. I... Well, it's a bit much to get my head around, to be frank. It's not every day you find out your mother is some kind of... crazy, feral, vigilante dragon lady.
Valka: Oh.
Valka: Well... at least I'm not boring. Right?
Valka: Good dragons under the control of bad people do bad things.
Ruffnut: Hey, watch it! That was close...
Ruffnut: Oh, my... Me likey.
Ruffnut: Take me.
Valka: Some of us were just born different.
Drago Bludvist: The dragons are mine now.
Hiccup: Uh, hold-hold on! Wait just a minute!
Valka: This way!
Hiccup: Come back here!
Valka: Come!
Hiccup: You can't just say something like that and run off! You're my MOTHER? I mean, what the...? Do you... do you grasp how insane it sounds?
Valka: Come! Quickly!
Hiccup: I have questions! Where have you been all this time? What have... what have you been doing? Huh? They-they said you were dead! EVERYONE thinks you were eaten by...
Valka: All this time, you took after me.
Valka: And... where was I? I'm so sorry, Hiccup. Can we start over? Will you give me another chance?
Valka: I... I can teach all that I've learned these past twenty years, like...
Hiccup: Wow.
Valka: Now you can make those tight turns!
Hiccup: Did you know about this?
Valka: Every dragon has its secrets. And I'll show them all to you! We'll unlock every mystery, find every last species together, as mother and son!
Valka: This gift we share, Hiccup, it bonds us. This is who you are, son. Who WE are. And we will change the world for all dragons. We will make it a better, safer place.
Hiccup: Yeah! I mean, that sounds... amazing!
Astrid: What are you doing, Snotlout? They're gonna win now!
Snotlout: She's my princess! Whatever she wants, she gets!
Astrid: Ruffnut? Didn't she try to bury you alive?
Snotlout: Only for a few hours!
Hiccup: Uh, wait! Okay, uh, Dad, there-there's something you need to know!
Stoick the Vast: Yeah, yeah. Tell me on the way.
Hiccup: No, this isn't an on-the-way kind of update, actually.
Stoick the Vast: I've heard enough!
Hiccup: More of the earth-shattering-development variety.
Stoick the Vast: Yeah, just add it to the pile.
Hiccup: Yeah, I, uh, uh... Dad, u-unlike most surprises I spring on you, this is one you'll like. I-I promise. You just have to handle it... delicately. So...
Gobber: Uh, you might want to take this one.
Stoick the Vast: Huh?
Gobber: Oh, boy.
Hiccup: Oh, uh, Dad, could you put the sword away, please?
Valka: I know what you're gonna say, Stoick. How could I have done this? Stayed away all these years? And why didn't I come back to you? To our son? Well, what sign did I have that you could change, Stoick? That anyone on Berk could? I pleaded so many times to stop the fighting, to find another answer, but did any of you listen?
Gobber: This is why I never married. This and one other reason.
Valka: I know that I left you to raise Hiccup alone, but I thought he'd be better off without me. And I was wrong. I see that now! But...
Valka: Oh, stop being so stoic, Stoick! Go on! Shout! Scream! Say something!
Stoick the Vast: You're as beautiful as the day I lost you.
Tuffnut: I'll bloody his fist with my face if he tries to take my dragon!
Ruffnut: Or mine!
Tuffnut: Eh, you're such a moron.
Fishlegs: A beautiful moron.
Snotlout: Yeah.
Hiccup: Now dragons used to be a bit of a problem here, but that was five years ago. Now they've all moved in. And, really, why wouldn't they? We have custom stables, all-you-can-eat feeding stations, a full-service dragon wash, even top-of-the-line fire prevention, if I do say so myself.
Drago: You certainly are hard to get rid of, I'll say that.
Hiccup: Toothless? Hey, it's me, bud. It's me. It's me, I'm right here, bud. Come back to me.
Drago: He's not yours anymore. He belongs to the Alpha!
Drago: But, please, O great Dragon Master, TRY to take him. He will not miss a second time.
Hiccup: It wasn't your fault, bud. They... made you do it. You'd never hurt him. You'd never hurt me.
Drago: How are you doing that?
Hiccup: Please, you... are my best friend, bud. My best friend.
Eret: They wouldn't know where you're hiding. I promise you that.
Astrid: Oh, yes, they will! They know we're missing and they have tracking dragons. If you so much as touch us, Hiccup is gonna kick...
Drago: Hiccup?
Eret: He's no problem. Really. Trust me.
Astrid: He's only the son of Stoick the Vast, his heir to the throne of Berk, and the greatest dragon master this world has ever seen!
Drago: Dragon master? I alone control the dragons!
Tuffnut: Nope, mm-mm.
Fishlegs: SORRY!
Astrid: And unless you let us go, right now, he will blast through here on his Night Fury and blow your entire fleet of ships to splinters.
Ruffnut: Then they'll be crying like babies!
Snotlout: Here you go, babe. Did I tell you that you look amazing today? 'Cause you do.
Astrid: I don't like it. They should have been back with Hiccup by now.
Ruffnut: I don't like it either. Eret, Son of Eret, was the man of my dreams. My everything!
Snotlout: But, baby, I grew facial hair for you.
Fishlegs: Me, too.
Gobber: Some might suggest this is poorly conceived!
Hiccup: Well, it's a good thing that I never listen.
Gobber: Whoa! So...
Gobber: ... what is your...
Gobber: ... plan?
Hiccup: Get Toothless back and kick Drago's...
Snotlout: Could this day get any worse?
Tuffnut: Uh, lemme see: We're jumpin' in freezing cold water, and then die from drowning.
Eret: Looks refreshing.
Hiccup: How did you survive?
Valka: Oh, Cloudjumper never meant to harm me. He... must've thought I belonged here.
Valka: In the home of the great Bewilderbeast. The alpha species. One of the very few that still exist. Every nest has its queen, but this is the KING of all dragons. With his icy breath, this graceful giant built our nest, a safe haven for dragons everywhere.
Hiccup: Wait, that's the ice-spitter? HE'S responsible for all that destruction?
Valka: He protects us. We all live under his care and his command.
Valka: All but the babies, of course...
Valka: ...who listen to no one!
Astrid: Never take a toy from a dragon. Don't you know anything?
Hiccup: Ah, okay! Just...
Hiccup: Just hold still!
Hiccup: Very serious.
Hiccup: "You're all grown up. And since no chief could ask for a better successor, I've decided - "
Astrid: To make you Chief! Oh, my gods! Hiccup, that's AMAZING!
Hiccup: OH! You're going to wear out the spring coil. The calibration is very sensitive.
Hiccup: Yeah, so... This is what I'm dealing with.
Astrid: What'd you tell him?
Hiccup: I-I didn't. By the time he turned around I was gone.
Astrid: Huh, well... that's a lot of responsibility. The map will have to wait, for sure, and I'll need to fly Toothless since you'll be too busy, but...
Hiccup: I-It's not me, Astrid. All those speeches and planning and running the village, that's *his* thing.
Astrid: I think you're missing the point. I mean, Chief. What an honor. I'd be pretty excited.
Hiccup: I... I'm not like you. You... know exactly who you are. You always have. I'm still looking. I know that I'm not my father, and I've never met my mother, so... what does that make me?
Astrid: What you're searching for isn't out there, Hiccup.
Astrid: It's in here.
Stoick the Vast: Boar-headed - just like his mother. Aye, she could never stay put, either.
Gobber: Eh, he's just 20, and a Viking. I mean, could there be a worse combination? Ha! When I think of how stubborn and senseless *you* were back in the day. Oh. Now, not much has changed, actually.
