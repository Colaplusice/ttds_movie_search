Tae-Sik Cha: You live only for tomorrow.
Man-seok: What?
Tae-Sik Cha: The ones that live for tomorrow, get fucked by the ones living for today.
Man-seok: What are you babbling about?
Tae-Sik Cha: I only live for today. I'll show you just how fucked up that can be.
Jeong So-mi: Mister? I embarrass you too, right? That's why you ignored me? It's okay. My teacher and all the kids do that too. Mom said that if I get lost, I should forget our address and phone number. She gets drunk and says we should die. Even though that pig called me a bum... you're meaner. But I don't hate you. Because if I do, I won't have anyone I like. Thinking about it hurts me here. So I won't hate you.
Storekeeper: Kids will learn from their mistakes. Parenting isn't just giving birth. She's always by herself. Bring her around more often, like the other dads. It's on me.
Tae-Sik Cha: I'm sorry for pretending I did not know you.
Tae-Sik Cha: I really wanted to know you, so I pretended I did not knew you.
Jeong So-mi: What does that mean?
Tae-Sik Cha: I don't know either.
Jeong So-mi: Ghost and Trash. Sounds like a rock band, isn't it?
Tae-Sik Cha: How many cavities you have?
Man-seok: What?
Tae-Sik Cha: I have a pawn shop... and I take gold teeth.
Tae-Sik Cha: I take the gold teeth... and chew all the rest.
