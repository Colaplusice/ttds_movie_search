Imran Habib: What's your name?
Laila: Laila.
Imran Habib: My name is Imraan. But friends call me 'Majnu'.
Laila: After achieving so much, are you happy? Do you miss something? Take time out for those things that really make you happy, like cooking...
Arjun: Ya, well that's the plan. I will retire after 40...
Laila: How do you know you will live till 40? Seize the day my friend!
Arjun: One should learn how to live life from you, I spend my entire life inside a box.
Laila: A person should remain in a box only once he is dead.
Arjun: Seriously? Majnu? I mean, Yuck.
Imran Habib: Arjun, it's the duty of man to try, success and failure is all in god's hands.
Natasha: I don't want to give your friend the impression that I'm a witch.
Imran Habib: Witch alert!
Kabir Dewan: How was your flight?
Imran Habib: Well, it flew.
Kabir Dewan: Dude, I heard something about you.
Arjun: What?
Kabir Dewan: You know what it is.
Arjun: Mom told you?
Kabir Dewan: Yes.
Arjun: But did she tell you that I was forced? Okay?
Kabir Dewan: Okay.
Arjun: God man! She can't keep anything to herself. She is driving me crazy, man. Ten days ago, she came to London. She dragged me to some friend's relative's place to see a girl. Neelu aunty and Gogi uncle's daughter, Cookie. I had decided that I would go, have some tea, say thank you uncle, thank you aunty, say no and come back. As soon as I took the first sip of my tea, Cookie said no. So... you know...
Imran Habib: What?
Kabir Dewan: What?
Arjun: I mean, so what! What is there?
Arjun: What? Come on, man!
Kabir Dewan: So you went for an arrange marriage and you got rejected!
Arjun: But I didn't even create an impression! I didn't want to impress her!
Imran Habib: No, no! You are just saying it now. You have ruined the reputation of our 'group'! Fail, fail, fail!
Arjun: Shut up, please stop it! And what was the need of telling you? What's wrong with her?
Imran Habib: Actually, aunty didn't tell anything to him. It's his new trick and you are his latest prey. Cheers!
Kabir Dewan: Cheers! 2000 pounds!
Kabir Dewan: Pappu failed!
Imran Habib: But Cookie passed!
Imran Habib: Thanks a lot yaar!
Arjun: For what?
Imran Habib: For coming on this trip. It means a lot to me.
Arjun: I am sure it does.
