Rani: My condition is like Gupta Uncle. He had cancer but never smoked cigarettes or consumed alcohol. It would be better if he did.
Marcello: Indian cook best, but Italian kiss best. Best, best, best.
Rani: Indians are best at everything. Pick out any Emraan Hashmi film, you'll find the best kissing.
Marcello: Indians best kissing? Show. Prove it!
Rani: Kiss? Lip-to-lip kiss?
Marcello: Yes, lip-to-lip. What did you think? Knee to knee? Your friends can wait outside. India can wait. I am a very gentle man. When I saw you in the restaurant for the first time...
Rani: I thought that robber such a lesson, that he'll think twice before messing with any Delhi girl
Vijayalakshmi: Why fart and waste it when you can burp and taste it!
Rani: My sense of humour is very nice. You'll find out soon.
Rani: I think Vijay is having sex in London!
Rani's Grandma: What have you been up to?
Rani: I'm watching television.
Rani's Grandma: If you wanted to just watch television, why go so far?
Rani: Look at me! I am alone because of him! I'm doing everything alone. Crossing roads alone. Seeing the Eiffel Tower alone. Fighting muggers alone.
Rani: Oh! My life is ruined! So ruined!
Vijayalakshmi: So what if you lost a Vijay, at least you gained a Vijaylakshmi!
Rani: Foreigners find Lajpat Nagar very funny!
Rani: Rain! It rains in India too.
Vijay: Vijay: Rani, please don't leave me. I really love you. I am sorry.
