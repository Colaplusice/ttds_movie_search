Logan: Nature made me a freak. Man made me a weapon. And God made it last too long.
Charles Xavier: You know, Logan... this is what life looks like. A home, people who love each other. Safe place. You should take a moment and feel it.
Laura: You are dying. You want to die.
Logan: How do you know?
Laura: Charles told me.
Logan: What else did he tell you?
Laura: To not let you.
Logan: Take your friends and run... They'll keep coming, and coming... You don't have to fight anymore.
Logan: Go... Don't be what they made you.
Logan: Laura.
Laura: Daddy.
Logan: So... this is what it feels like.
Charles Xavier: You know, Logan. This was, without a doubt, the most perfect night I've had in a very long time... and I don't deserve it, do I?
Charles Xavier: I did something. Something unspeakable. I've remembered what happened in Westchester. This is not the first time I've hurt people. Until today, I didn't know. You wouldn't tell me. So we just kept on running away from it. I think I finally understand you.
Charles Xavier: Two days on the road, only one meal, and hardly any sleep. She's 11, I'm fucking 90...
Charles Xavier: What are these?
Logan: You know what they are. The shots mellow the seizures. The pills keep them from happening. How about you blow on them to make them safe?
Charles Xavier: Fuck off, Logan.
Logan: So you remember who I am now.
Charles Xavier: I always know who you are. It's just sometimes I don't recognize you.
Charles Xavier: Logan, you still have time.
Laura: You had a nightmare.
Logan: Do you have nightmares?
Laura: Si. People hurt me.
Logan: Mine are different.
Laura: Por que?
Logan: I hurt people.
Laura: Que es esto?
Logan: You know what it is. It's made out of adamantium. That's what they put inside of us. That's why it can kill us. Probably what's killing me now. That was a long time ago. I kept it as a reminder of what I am. Now I keep it to, uh... actually I, uh... I was thinking of shooting myself with it. Like Charles said.
Laura: I've hurt people too.
Logan: You're gonna have to learn how to live with that.
Laura: They were bad people.
Logan: All the same...
Charles Xavier: Our boat... the Sunseeker.
Logan: Who is she?
Charles Xavier: She's like you... she's very much like you.
Donald Pierce: Charles Xavier, the world famous mutant octogenarian.
Charles Xavier: Actually, I'm a nonagenarian.
Laura: A man has to be what he is, Joey. Can't break the mold. There's no living with the killing. There's no going back. Right or wrong, it's a brand. A brand that sticks. Now you run on home to your mother... you tell her everything's alright. There are no more guns in the valley.
Rictor: Let's go. We gotta move.
Convenience Store Clerk: Hello. You know you gotta pay for that, right?
Convenience Store Clerk: Hey, c'mon. Where are your parents?
Logan: Not okay!
Logan: I'm sorry. Do you sell phone chargers?
Logan: Bad shit happens to people I care about.
Caliban: Beware the light.
Logan: Your friends, they seem nice. Kinda reminds me of...
Logan: Hey, hey, what's goin' on? Huh?
Logan: You're with your pals. You made it.
Laura: Where will you go?
Logan: Nearest bar, for starters.
Logan: Hey, I got you here. That's all I signed up for. I even gave back the money.
Laura: Such a nice man.
Logan: Hey, I never asked for this! Alright? Charles never asked for this. Caliban never asked for this. And they are six feet under the ground! Now, I don't know what Charles put in your head, but I am *not* whatever it is you think I am, okay?
Logan: I only met you, like, a *week* ago. You got your Rebecca, your Delilah, your blah, blah, blah, whatever. Everything you asked for, you've got it!
Logan: And it is *better* this way. Because I *suck* at this. Bad shit happens to people I care about. You understand me?
Laura: Then I'll be fine.
Logan: Fuck.
Charles Xavier: They need our help.
Logan: Someone will come along!
Charles Xavier: Someone HAS come along.
Charles Xavier: Logan.
Logan: I don't wanna talk about it. I don't wanna hear it anymore.
Charles Xavier: Logan.
Logan: Just stop!
Charles Xavier: I have to pee.
Donald Pierce: As I live and breathe, "the Wolverine".
Logan: Where we're going, "Eden..." It doesn't exist. The nurse got it from a comic book. You understand? It's not real.
Charles Xavier: It is for Laura...
Charles Xavier: It is for Laura.
Logan: Motherfucking auto trucks!
Charles Xavier: Language, Logan. And you're screaming at a machine.
Logan: Oh, what? She can gut a man with her feet, but she can't hear a few naughty words?
Logan: You read these in your spare time? Oh, yeah, Charles, we got ourselves an X-Men fan. You do know they're all bullshit, right? Maybe a quarter of it happened, and not like this. In the real world, people die. And no self-promoting asshole in a fucking leotard can stop it. This is ice cream for bed-wetters.
Gabriela: She is not my daughter, but I love her. You may not love her, but she is your daughter. Please, help her.
Charles Xavier: You leave me alone with that fucking albino. He doesn't listen to me... I know a damn speciation when I see one.
Logan: What?
Charles Xavier: Speciation. New mutant. A young one. There are forces trying to kill them. They want help.
Logan: Forces, forces... It's too bad you're not in that business anymore.
Charles Xavier: They don't want me, they want you.
Charles Xavier: Oh, yes. That's how fucking stupid they are... They're waiting for you at the Statue of Liberty.
Logan: Statue of Liberty was a long time ago, Charles. A long time. There are no new mutants, you understand? Hasn't been a new one born in 25 years. Not anywhere. I always thought we were part of God's plan. Maybe... Maybe we were God's mistake.
Charles Xavier: What a disappointment you are... When I found you, you were pursuing a career as a cage fighter. You were an animal... But we took you in. I gave you a family.
Logan: They're gone now.
Charles Xavier: Logan... What did you do?
Charles Xavier: What did you do? Answer me! Why are we here? No one should live like this, drugged in a fucking tank!
Logan: It's for your own good.
Charles Xavier: No, no! It's not!
Charles Xavier: You're waiting for me to die...
Donald Pierce: No. No! NO!
Donald Pierce: Jesus, Wolverine, seeing you like this just breaks my damn heart.
Logan: As soon as I rip it out of your chest, fuck-stick.
Caliban: A year ago... you asked me to help you, and... God knows, I've tried... But I can't help you, Logan, not really... if you're not gonna talk to me.
Caliban: I hear you at night; you're not sleeping; you don't wanna talk about that... Or the booze you're drinking... Or the pus you're wiping away from your knuckles. Or the blood I wash from your clothes. Or the... fresh wounds in your chest; the ones that aren't healing... And I'm pretty sure you don't wanna talk about the fact that you can't read the label on that bottle...
Caliban: It says 'Ibuprofen'.
Caliban: That was my favourite mug.
Logan: Stay outta my shit.
Logan: You read these in your spare time?
Logan: Oh yeah, Charles, we got ourselves an X-Men fan.
Logan: You do know they're all bullshit, right? Maybe a quarter of it happened, and not like this. In the real world, people die, and no self-promoting asshole in a fucking leotard can stop this.
Charles Xavier: Logan.
Logan: This is ice cream for bed-wetters.
Charles Xavier: Logan.
Logan: Your nurse had been feeding you some grade-A bullshit.
Charles Xavier: I don't think Laura needs reminding of life's impermanence.
Laura: Daddy.
Logan: I don't know how you got me here, but thank you.
Laura: De nada.
Logan: Yeah.
Logan: You can talk?
Logan: You can talk?
Logan: What the fuck? Why in the fuck... What's all this bullshit's been for the last 2,000 fucking miles?
Logan: What? Okay, shut up! Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Laura: Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah, Rictor.
Logan: What? Who's that?
Laura: Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah, Rictor.
Logan: Who is that?
Caliban: Found this in your pocket. Adamantium. If you are planning to blow your brains out, could you wait till you're out on the high seas? I just mopped these floors.
Donald Pierce: I'm a fan, by the way.
Donald Pierce: Showtime, boy!
Logan: Who the fuck are you?
Donald Pierce: You know, you got some buckshot on your door. I hear you was in Phoenix. But then last night some friends of mine in Texas HP called, told me they found three dead cholos on a pullout at fifty-four. Not unusual I know. Except one was missing a hand another one a leg. So they was thinkin' it was either a escaped tiger or Freddy Krueger. But not one of them could drive: one being fictional the other one extinct. And since the wheel lugs they found belonged to a twenty-two Chrysler... Well, this is a twenty-two Chrysler.
Donald Pierce: She found you yet? Gabriela?
Donald Pierce: See... I'm not looking for you Wolvie. Well, I'm really looking for someone who's looking for you. She took somethin' of mine when I wasn't lookin'. Something for which I'm responsible. Mexican lady. Has her sights on you now. Doesn't ring any bells?
Logan: I don't know any Gabriela, so get the fuck out of my car.
Donald Pierce: Ya know...
Donald Pierce: I know whatchu hiding amigo. The old cueball south of the border.
Logan: What do you want?
Donald Pierce: A little co-operation.
Donald Pierce: I'm a fan, by the way.
Logan: Fuck, fuck!
Laura: Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah, Rictor. North Dakota.
Logan: What?
Laura: North Dakota, por favor.
Laura: No, por favor.
Logan: This place, okay? Your nurse, she read too many stories, you understand? Too many stories!
Logan: I've seen it! I've seen it, okay? This all here. None of this... No existo, okay? You understand me? This Eden does not exist. No!
Laura: Si! Eden!
Logan: No! It's a fantasy, kid. See that? Those are the names of the people who just made this...
Logan: They made this whole thing up. Okay? This whole... It happened once and they just turned it into a big fucking lie!
Logan: That's all it is. No! Fuck!
Logan: I know, I understand.
Logan: This is a long way. You understand? I'm not taking you to North Dakota.
Logan: I am fucked up. And I cannot get you there. It is a two-day drive. And I am not taking you...
Logan: Don't fucking hit me! Don't hit me!
Laura: Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah, Rictor.
Logan: Stop saying those names. Right now. Stop saying those names. Stop it! Stop! Fuck it. Fine, fine. You wanna go? I'll take you there. See for yourself. Let's go to fucking fantasyland.
Charles Xavier: I like those. They make you look younger.
Will Munson: He's a friend of mine.
Jackson: A friend with a big mouth.
Logan: I hear that a lot.
Jackson: Then you probably hear this, too.
Logan: More than I'd like.
Jackson: Than you know the drill. I'mma count to three... and you're gonna start walking away.
Will Munson: I got rights to this water.
Jackson: One.
Will Munson: I have a lawyer now.
Jackson: Two.
Logan: Three.
Logan: You know the drill. Get the hell out of here.
Logan: GO!
Logan: This is my father... Chuck.
Logan: Where's Caliban?
Donald Pierce: Why don't you tell me where the girl is first? Or I can ask the old man, he seems quite friendly...
Logan: I told you she's not here. Where's Caliban, motherfucker?
Donald Pierce: Well, I left him in the same ditch you was going to leave me in...
Donald Pierce: Stop shooting! She heals.
Logan: It's got a lot of water...
Charles Xavier: The new Quesalupa from Taco Bell! Get it with chicken! Get it with steak! And with the cheese baked right in the shell, it's the next big thing! Go now while supplies la -
Donald Pierce: See. You're not the only one who's been enhanced.
Charles Xavier: In a pride of lions, the female is both hunter and caregiver.
Newscaster: Emergency personnel are still on scene at Harrah's Casino Hotel in Oklahoma City where at least 400 guests were stricken with temporary paralysis yesterday. Many are noting a similarity to the Westchester incident over a year ago that left over 600 injured and took the lives of seven mutants, including several of the X-Men.
Logan: Hey, keep it out front. Alright?
Caliban: I don't want to fight, but there's things we need to discuss.
Logan: What things?
Caliban: Well, would it be considered nagging if I was to repeat my previous observation that the dose is too low to suppress the seizures?
Logan: It's what the guy gave me. I wasn't in a position to make demands.
Caliban: Well I almost died this morning. That seizure was...
Logan: It was barely a minute!
Caliban: It felt a lot longer than a minute. I couldn't breathe. You're less affected.
Jackson: What in high...
Dr. Rice: Maria, we do not dress them up for Halloween. We do not call them "honey" or kiss boo-boos. Don't think of them as children. Think of them as things with copyrights and patents. Comprende?
Donald Pierce: I want you to breathe. It's just a flesh wound, baby.
Caliban: Looks like ex-military. Bounty hunter, maybe.
Logan: Worse.
Caliban: Is he by himself?
Logan: Not for long.
Logan: Get him back in his ride, take him out to the wash and dump him.
Caliban: What if he wakes up before I get there?
Logan: Text me where you are. We'll pick you up.
