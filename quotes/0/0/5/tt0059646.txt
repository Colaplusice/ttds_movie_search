Carol: We must get this crack mended.
Colin: Are you playing hard to get? I've been waiting over an hour!
Carol: What for?
Colin: Well, not for Christmas. We made a date. Remember? We're having supper tonight.
Carol: Oh, I forgot.
Colin: Well, next time you forget, maybe you'll let me know.
Michael: Go and put your best bib and tucker on. I feel like a spree.
Mrs. Rendlesham: Have you fallen asleep?
Carol: Oh, I'm sorry.
Mrs. Rendlesham: I think you must be in love or something.
Carol: I'm having dinner with my sister.
Colin: Is she a good cook?
Carol: I never even thought about it.
Colin: Well, at least it can't be any worst than fish and chips.
Carol: I think we are having rabbit.
Colin: Rabbit? Oh. I thought they'd all been killed off.
Carol: No. She has a friend.
Colin: A rabbit?
Carol: No, I think the friend has rabbits.
Colin: Poor bunny.
John: Oh, come on. Fill us in with the gripping details.
Colin: The gripping details are that she had dinner with her sister.
John: Well, maybe you should try the sister.
Landlord: There's no need to be alone, you know. Poor little girl. All by herself. All shaking like a little frightened animal.
Carol: Will we be going to see the leaning tower of Pisa?
Michael: I don't think Cinderella likes me.
Carol: Cinderella?
Michael: The little sister.
Carol: Aw, don't be silly. Well, are we going to see the leaning tower of Pisa?
Michael: She's a bit strung up, isn't she?
Carol: She's just sensitive, that's all.
Michael: You'd think they'd have something better to do than clang away like that all the time.
Helen: It's worst when they start doing it at midnight.
Michael: I wonder what they ring it for anyway? Perhaps they have wild parties! Maybe they'll invite me sometime.
Carol: We all have to lead our own lives in the end, you know.
Helen: Just the sound of his voice makes my flesh creep! Money! Money! Money! That's all he ever thinks about.
Carol: What's the matter?
Bridget: Nothing.
Carol: Tell me.
Bridget: Nothing! Just... bloody men! Promise you the earth and then... Oh, I could cut my throat.
Carol: Don't talk like that.
Bridget: I thought this one was different.
Carol: Did he...
Bridget: Oh, he was a pig!
John: You should have seen them. They went for each other like those women wrestlers in Hamburg. One had big legs and with bloody great charlies.
Reggie: Lesbians?
John: No. No. They both fancied the same bloke. I should have his luck.
Bridget: You ought to go out. Go to a movie or something!
Carol: Oh, I'd love to.
Bridget: Well, that's it then! Do it! We saw such a funny Chaplin film at the Classic the other night. What was it called?
Bridget: I thought I'd die laughing. He was so hungry, he wanted to eat his shoes.
Carol: No?
Bridget: He pretended the laces were spaghetti.
Bridget: There was this huge, great big fat man, who wanted to eat him! He wanted to eat Charlie Chaplin! He thought Charlie was a chicken.
Carol: A chicken?
Bridget: Yes. And the chicken walked like Chaplin too. You know.
Bridget: Roger laughed so much, I was quite ashamed of him. You ought to see it, though, to cheer you up.
Michael: Come on. You're not going into the Miss World competition.
Carol: Is Bridget about?
John: How did you get on with little Miss Muffet?
Helen: Mmm... Mmm... Oh... Mmmm... Oh-oh-mmm! Oh! Oh-oh-oh-oh! Ohhhhh! Ohhh... Oh...
Michael: Are you coming or aren't you?
Helen: Yes. Yes. I'm coming.
Michael: Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Miss Balch: There's only one way to deal with men. That's treat them as though you don't give a damn about them! I've told you all this before! Still, I'm glad to see you have listened to me - just this once. There's only one thing that they want and I'll never know why they make such a fuss about it. But, they do! And the more you make them beg for it, the happier they are.
Bridget: He rang *me* up this morning.
Miss Balch: I said he would.
Bridget: He was practically on his knees!
Miss Balch: Well, make sure he stays that way.
Miss Balch: I don't suppose it would do me any harm if I had a little snack.
Bridget: Well what do you fancy?
Miss Balch: They're all the same. Just like children. They want to be spanked, then given sweets. Perhaps, a little Danish pastry and a cup of chocolate.
Bridget: Carole will order it for you. Carole? Stop dreaming! You feeling alright, love?
Madame Denise: I better go and see what that old bitch wants. Now, you go back to work. I'll talk to you later. And, Carole, do something about your hair.
Bridget: I should have your luck, getting off early. Come on! Cheer up! Don't look so miz.
John: Still keeping her legs crossed? She's getting you down, you know. The old, old story: not before we're married, darling. I wouldn't waste your money.
Reggie: She seems a bit lost to me.
John: I mean, don't let her being foreign fool you. They're all the same, these bloody virgins. They're just teasers, that's all.
Reggie: She seems to have ol' Colin nicely steamed up though.
John: She gets a big thrill out of it.
Reggie: You tell her, she'll soon strip off.
Colin: When I want your advice, I'll ask for it.
Reggie: Look, it was only a joke! There's no need to bloody pass off going on like Cassius Clay all over the place! A joke, boy, a joke!
John: Look, relax, take it easy, enjoy life!
Colin: I wish I could find the proper words to say. They just keep going around and around in my head. I just - I want to be - to be with you - all the time.
Carol: Hello.
Woman on the Phone: You filthy bitch!
Carol: I'm sorry, who is this?
Woman on the Phone: Who is this? Who is this? Who do you think, you filthy little tart? You think I don't know he's with you? You think you're clever, but you're not that clever, you filthy bitch.
Landlord: Well, let's have a little light on the subject.
Carol: No!
Landlord: I'm not a bloody owl, you know.
Landlord: I thought I'd seen everything. This is a flaming nut house!
Landlord: Yes, a nice soft cup of tea and an aspirin and you'll be as right as rain.
Landlord: I could be a very good friend to you, you know. You look after me and you can forget about the rent. Come on. Come on. Just a little kiss between us. Huh? Come on.
Neighbour: I'll get her some brandy.
Helen: Why'd you throw Michael's things away? Why'd you do it?
Carol: I don't like them there.
Helen: It's got absolutely nothing to do with you. Silly little fool.
