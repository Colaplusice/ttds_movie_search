Dr. Raymond Stantz: Everything was fine with our system until the power grid was shut off by dickless here.
Walter Peck: They caused an explosion!
Mayor: Is this true?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Yes it's true.
Dr. Peter Venkman: This man has no dick.
Walter Peck: Jeez!
Mayor: Break it up! Hey, break this up! Break it up!
Walter Peck: All right, all right, all right!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Well, that's what I heard!
Dr. Peter Venkman: This city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportions.
Mayor: What do you mean, "biblical"?
Dr. Raymond Stantz: What he means is Old Testament, Mr. Mayor, real wrath of God type stuff.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Exactly.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies! Rivers and seas boiling!
Dr. Egon Spengler: Forty years of darkness! Earthquakes, volcanoes...
Winston Zeddemore: The dead rising from the grave!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria!
Mayor: All right, all right! I get the point!
Gozer: Are you a God?
Dr. Raymond Stantz: No.
Gozer: Then... DIE!
Winston Zeddemore: Ray, when someone asks you if you're a god, you say "YES"!
Dr. Peter Venkman: All right! This chick is TOAST!
Dr. Peter Venkman: We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!
Dr. Egon Spengler: Vinz, you said before you were waiting for a sign. What sign are you waiting for?
Louis: Gozer the Traveler. He will come in one of the pre-chosen forms. During the rectification of the Vuldrini, the traveler came as a large and moving Torg! Then, during the third reconciliation of the last of the McKetrick supplicants, they chose a new form for him: that of a giant Slor! Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you!
Janine Melnitz: Do you believe in UFOs, astral projections, mental telepathy, ESP, clairvoyance, spirit photography, telekinetic movement, full trance mediums, the Loch Ness monster and the theory of Atlantis?
Winston Zeddemore: Ah, if there's a steady paycheck in it, I'll believe anything you say.
Dr. Egon Spengler: There's something very important I forgot to tell you.
Dr. Peter Venkman: What?
Dr. Egon Spengler: Don't cross the streams.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Why?
Dr. Egon Spengler: It would be bad.
Dr. Peter Venkman: I'm fuzzy on the whole good/bad thing. What do you mean, "bad"?
Dr. Egon Spengler: Try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Total protonic reversal.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Right. That's bad. Okay. All right. Important safety tip. Thanks, Egon.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Grab your stick!
Dr. Raymond Stantz, Dr. Egon Spengler, Winston Zeddemore: HOLDIN'!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Heat 'em up!
Dr. Raymond Stantz, Dr. Egon Spengler, Winston Zeddemore: SMOKIN'!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Make 'em hard!
Dr. Raymond Stantz, Dr. Egon Spengler, Winston Zeddemore: READY!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Let's show this prehistoric bitch how we do things downtown... THROW IT!
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Personally, I liked the university. They gave us money and facilities, we didn't have to produce anything! You've never been out of college! You don't know what it's like out there! I've WORKED in the private sector. They expect *results*.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Alice, I'm going to ask you a couple of standard questions, okay? Have you or any of your family been diagnosed schizophrenic? Mentally incompetent?
Librarian Alice: My uncle thought he was Saint Jerome.
Dr. Peter Venkman: I'd call that a big yes. Uh, are you habitually using drugs? Stimulants? Alcohol?
Librarian Alice: No.
Dr. Peter Venkman: No, no. Just asking. Are you, Alice, menstruating right now?
Library Administrator: What has that got to do with it?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Back off, man. I'm a scientist.
Dana Barrett: I want you inside me.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Go ahead! No, I can't. It sounds like you've got at least two or three people in there already.
Dr. Peter Venkman: We've been going about this all wrong. This Mr. Stay Puft's okay! He's a sailor, he's in New York; we get this guy laid, we won't have any trouble!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Ray has gone bye-bye, Egon... what've you got left?
Dr. Egon Spengler: Sorry, Venkman, I'm terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: You know, it just occurred to me that we really haven't had a successful test of this equipment.
Dr. Egon Spengler: I blame myself.
Dr. Peter Venkman: So do I.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Well, no sense in worrying about it now.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Why worry? Each one of us is carrying an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Symmetrical book stacking. Just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947.
Dr. Peter Venkman: You're right, no HUMAN BEING would stack books like this.
Dr. Peter Venkman: What I'd really like to do is talk to Dana. Dana? It's Peter.
Dana Barrett: There is no Dana, there is only Zuul.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Oh, Zuulie, you nut, now c'mon. Just relax, c'mon. I want to talk to Dana. Dana, Dana. Can I talk to Dana?
Dana Barrett: There is no Dana, only Zuul!
Dr. Peter Venkman: What a lovely singing voice you must have.
Gozer: The Choice is made!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Whoa! Ho! Ho! Whoa-oa!
Gozer: The Traveller has come!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Nobody choosed anything!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Did you choose anything?
Dr. Egon Spengler: No.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Did YOU?
Winston Zeddemore: My mind is totally blank.
Dr. Peter Venkman: I didn't choose anything...
Dr. Raymond Stantz: I couldn't help it. It just popped in there.
Dr. Peter Venkman: What? WHAT "just popped in there?"
Dr. Raymond Stantz: I... I... I tried to think...
Dr. Egon Spengler: LOOK!
Dr. Raymond Stantz: No! It CAN'T be!
Dr. Peter Venkman: What is it?
Dr. Raymond Stantz: It CAN'T be!
Dr. Peter Venkman: What did you DO, Ray?
Winston Zeddemore: Oh, shit!
Dr. Raymond Stantz: It's the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.
Man at Elevator: What are you supposed to be, some kind of a cosmonaut?
Dr. Peter Venkman: No, we're exterminators. Someone saw a cockroach up on twelve.
Man at Elevator: That's gotta be some cockroach.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Bite your head off, man.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Going up?
Man at Elevator: I'll take the next one.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night?
Dr. Egon Spengler: Do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Have you or your family ever seen a spook, spectre or ghost?
Dr. Raymond Stantz: If the answer is "yes," then don't wait another minute. Pick up the phone and call the professionals...
Dr. Raymond Stantz, Dr. Egon Spengler, Dr. Peter Venkman: Ghostbusters.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Our courteous and efficient staff is on call 24 hours a day to serve all your supernatural elimination needs.
Dr. Raymond Stantz, Dr. Egon Spengler, Dr. Peter Venkman: We're ready to believe you.
Dr. Egon Spengler: I have a radical idea. The door swings both ways, we could reverse the particle flow through the gate.
Dr. Peter Venkman: How?
Dr. Egon Spengler: We'll cross the streams.
Dr. Peter Venkman: 'Scuse me Egon? You said crossing the streams was bad!
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Cross the streams...
Dr. Peter Venkman: You're gonna endanger us, you're gonna endanger our client - the nice lady, who paid us in advance, before she became a dog...
Dr. Egon Spengler: Not necessarily. There's definitely a VERY SLIM chance we'll survive.
Dr. Peter Venkman: I love this plan! I'm excited to be a part of it! LET'S DO IT!
Winston Zeddemore: This job is definitely not worth $11,500 a year.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Gozer the Gozerian... good evening. As a duly designated representative of the City, County and State of New York, I order you to cease any and all supernatural activity and return forthwith to your place of origin or to the nearest convenient parallel dimension.
Dr. Peter Venkman: That oughta do it. Thanks very much, Ray.
Janine Melnitz: You're very handy, I can tell. I bet you like to read a lot, too.
Dr. Egon Spengler: Print is dead.
Janine Melnitz: Oh, that's very fascinating to me. I read a lot myself. Some people think I'm too intellectual but I think it's a fabulous way to spend your spare time. I also play raquetball. Do you have any hobbies?
Dr. Egon Spengler: I collect spores, molds, and fungus.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Are you okay?
Louis: Who are you guys?
Dr. Raymond Stantz: We're the Ghostbusters.
Louis: Who does your taxes?
Dr. Raymond Stantz: You know, Mr. Tully, you are a most fortunate individual.
Louis: I know!
Dr. Raymond Stantz: You have been a participant in the biggest interdimensional cross rip since the Tunguska blast of 1909!
Louis: Felt great.
Dr. Egon Spengler: We'd like to get a sample of your brain tissue.
Louis: Okay.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: I've gotta get this in the clear...!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Wait, wait, wait! I've always wanted to do this...
Dr. Peter Venkman: And the flowers are still standing!
Winston Zeddemore: Hey Ray. Do you believe in God?
Dr Ray Stantz: Never met him.
Winston Zeddemore: Yeah, well, I do. And I love Jesus's style, you know.
Dr Ray Stantz: The entire roof cap is made out of a magnesium-tungsten alloy...
Winston Zeddemore: What are you so involved with over there?
Dr Ray Stantz: These are the blueprints for structural ironwork of Dana Barret's apartment building, and they are very, very strange.
Winston Zeddemore: Hey Ray. Do you remember something in the bible about the last days when the dead would rise from the grave?
Dr Ray Stantz: I remember Revelations 6:12...?And I looked, and he opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake. And the sun became as black as sack cloth, and the moon became as blood."
Winston Zeddemore: "And the seas boiled and the skies fell."
Dr Ray Stantz: Judgement day.
Winston Zeddemore: Judgement day.
Dr Ray Stantz: Every ancient religion has its own myth about the end of the world.
Winston Zeddemore: Myth? Ray, has it ever occurred to you that maybe the reason we've been so busy lately is 'cause the dead HAVE been rising from the grave?
Dr Ray Stantz: How 'bout a little music?
Winston Zeddemore: Yeah.
Louis: I am the Keymaster! The Destructor is coming. Gozer the Traveler, the Destroyer.
Louis: Gatekeeper.
Louis: I am Vinz, Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer. Volguus Zildrohar, Lord of the Sebouillia. Are you the Gatekeeper?
Coachman: Hey, he pulls the wagon, I made the deals. You want a ride?
Louis: Wait for the sign. Then our prisoners will be released.
Louis: You will perish in flame, you and all your kind! Gatekeeper!
Coachman: What an asshole.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Listen... you smell something?
Winston Zeddemore: Ray, when someone asks you if you're a god, you say, "yes!"
Dr. Raymond Stantz: The whole building is a huge, superconductive antenna that was designed and built expressly for the purpose of pulling in and concentrating spiritual turbulence. Your girlfriend lives in the corner penthouse... of Spook Central.
Dr. Peter Venkman: She's not my girlfriend. I find her interesting because she's a client and because she sleeps above her covers... FOUR FEET above her covers. She barks, she drools, she claws!
Dr. Egon Spengler: It's not the *girl*, Peter, it's the *building*.
Dr. Peter Venkman: If I'm wrong, nothing happens! We go to jail - peacefully, quietly. We'll enjoy it! But if I'm *right*, and we *can* stop this thing... Lenny, you will have saved the lives of millions of registered voters.
Winston Zeddemore: I'm Winston Zeddmore, Your Honor. I've only been with the company for a couple of weeks, but these things are real. Since I joined these men, I've seen shit that'll turn you white.
Dana Barrett: That's the bedroom, but nothing ever happened in there.
Dr. Peter Venkman: What a crime.
Dana Barrett: Do you want this body?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Is this a trick question?
Dr. Raymond Stantz: I tried to think of the most harmless thing. Something I loved from my childhood. Something that could never ever possibly destroy us. Mr. Stay Puft!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Nice thinkin', Ray.
Dr. Egon Spengler: Oh good, you're here!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Yeah, what have you got?
Dr. Egon Spengler: This is big, Peter, this is very big. There is definitely something here.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Egon, this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole through your head. Remember that?
Dr. Egon Spengler: That would have worked if you hadn't stopped me.
Walter Peck: Hold it! I want this man arrested! Captain, these men are in criminal violation of the Environmental Protection Act! And this explosion is a direct result of it!
Dr. Egon Spengler: YOUR MOTHER!
Janine Melnitz: I've quit better jobs than this.
Janine Melnitz: Ghostbusters, what do you want?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Egon, what do you think?
Dr. Egon Spengler: She's telling the truth. At least, she thinks she is.
Dana Barrett: Well, of course I'm telling the truth! Who would make up a story like that?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Some are people who just want attention. Others, just nutballs who come in off the street.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: You know what it could be? Past-life experience intruding on present time.
Dr. Egon Spengler: Could be race memory stored in the collective unconscious. I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
Dana Barrett: I'm sorry, I don't believe in any of those things.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Well, that's all right. I don't either.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Talk about telekinetic activity, look at this mess!
Dr. Egon Spengler: Raymond, look at this.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Ectoplasmic residue.
Dr. Egon Spengler: Venkman, get a sample of this.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: It's the real thing.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Somebody blows their nose and wanna keep it?
Dr. Egon Spengler: I'd like to analyze it.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: There's more over here.
Dr. Egon Spengler: I'm getting stronger readings here.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Whoa, ah.
Dr. Egon Spengler: This way.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: I think we'd better split up.
Dr. Egon Spengler: Good idea.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Yeah... we can do more damage that way.
Dr. Peter Venkman: OK... so... she's a dog...
Dr. Peter Venkman: Mother puss bucket!
Janine Melnitz: Hello, Ghostbusters... Yes, of course they're serious... You do?... You have?... No kidding! Just gimme the address... Oh sure, they will be totally discreet. Thank you!
Janine Melnitz: WE GOT ONE!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Hee hee hee! "Get her!" That was your whole plan, huh, "get her." Very scientific.
Dana Barrett: "Zuul was the minion of Gozer." What's Gozer?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Gozer was very big in Sumeria.
Dana Barrett: Well, what's he doing in my ice box?
Dr. Peter Venkman: I'm working on that.
Janine Melnitz: Dropping off or picking up?
Winston Zeddemore: I love this town!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Generally you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.
Dr. Egon Spengler: I feel like the floor of a taxi cab.
Dr. Peter Venkman: I don't have to take this abuse from you, I've got hundreds of people dying to abuse me.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Janine, someone with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top-flight job in either the food service or housekeeping industries.
Dr. Peter Venkman: You gonna answer that?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Ray, pretend for a moment that I don't know anything about metallurgy, engineering, or physics, and just tell me what the hell is going on.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: You never studied.
Woman at Party: Do you have any Excedrin or extra-strength Tylenol?
Louis: Gee, I think all I got is acetylsalicylic acid, generic. See, I can get six hundred tablets of that for the same price as three hundred of a name brand. That makes good financial sense, good advice...
Louis: Hey, this is real smoked salmon from Nova Scotia, Canada, $24.95 a pound! It only cost me $14.12 after tax, though.
Louis: I'm givin' this whole thing as a promotional expense, that's why I invited clients instead of friends. You havin' a good time, Mark?
Louis: How you doing? Why don't you have some of the brie, it's at room temperature!
Louis: You think it's too warm in here for the brie?
Tall Woman at Party: Louis, I'm going home.
Louis: Aw, don't leave yet. Well, listen, maybe if we start dancing other people will join in!
Tall Woman at Party: Okay!
Louis: Oh, don't move, I just gotta get the door.
Louis: Ted! Annette! I'm glad you could come, how you doin', give me your coats. Everybody, this is Ted and Annette Fleming! Ted has a small carpet cleaning business in receivership; Annette's drawing a salary from a deferred bonus from two years ago! They got fifteen thousand left on the house at eight percent.
Louis: So they're okay! So, does anybody wanna play Parcheesi?
Louis: Okay, who brought the dog?
Dr. Peter Venkman: This happen to you before?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Huh. First time?
Dr. Peter Venkman: I make it a rule never to get involved with possessed people.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Actually, it's more of a guideline than a rule...
Joe Franklin: As they say in T.V., I'm sure there's one big question on everybody's mind, and I imagine you are the man to answer that. How is Elvis, and have you seen him lately?
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Hey... Where these stairs go?
Dr. Peter Venkman: They go up!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Let me tell you something about myself. I come home from work to my place and all I have is my work. There's nothing else in my life!
Dana Barrett: Dr. Venkman...
Dr. Peter Venkman: I meet you, and I say, my God, there's someone with the same problem I have.
Dana Barrett: Yes. We both have the same problem. You!
Dr. Peter Venkman: I'm gonna go for broke. I am madly in love with you.
Dana Barrett: I don't believe this. Will you please leave?
Dr. Peter Venkman: And then she threw me out of her life. She thought I was a creep, she thought I was a geek, and she probably wasn't the first.
Dana Barrett: You are so odd.
Winston Zeddemore: Hey, wait a minute. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Hold it! Now, are we actually gonna go before a federal judge, and tell him that some moldy Babylonian god is going to drop in on Central Park West, and start tearing up the city?
Dr. Egon Spengler: Sumerian, not Babylonian.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Yeah. Big difference.
Winston Zeddemore: No offense, guys, but I've gotta get my own lawyer.
Janine Melnitz: Do you want some coffee, Mr. Tulley?
Louis: Do I?
Dr. Egon Spengler: Yes, have some.
Louis: Yes, have some.
Walter Peck: I'm Walter Peck, from the Environmental Protection?
Walter Peck: Agency, the third district.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Great, how's it going down there?
Walter Peck: Are you Peter Venkman?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Yes, I'm *Doctor* Venkman!
Walter Peck: Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Well, I have a PhD in parapsychology and psychology.
Walter Peck: And now, you catch ghosts?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Yeah, you could say that.
Walter Peck: And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
Dr. Peter Venkman: I'm not at liberty to say.
Walter Peck: And where do you put these ghosts, once you catch them?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Into a storage facility.
Walter Peck: And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Yes.
Walter Peck: And may I see this storage facility?
Dr. Peter Venkman: No.
Walter Peck: And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Because you did not use the magic word.
Walter Peck: What is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Please!
Walter Peck: May I *please* see the storage facility, Mr. Venkman?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Why do you want to see the storage facility?
Walter Peck: Because I'm curious. I wanna know more about what you do here! Frankly, I've heard alot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possibility of dangerous and possibly hazardous waste chemicals in your basement.
Walter Peck: Now you either *show me* what is down there, or I come back with a court order.
Dr. Peter Venkman: You go get a court order, and I'll sue your funny ass for wrongful prosecution.
Walter Peck: You can have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
Dr. Peter Venkman: NOBODY steps on a church in my town.
Dr. Peter Venkman: How's the grid holding up?
Dr. Egon Spengler: Not good.
Winston Zeddemore: Tell him about the Twinkie.
Dr. Peter Venkman: What about the Twinkie?
Dr. Peter Venkman: What happened?
Policeman at Apartment: Some moron brought a cougar to a party and it went berserk.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: It's a girl.
Dr. Egon Spengler: It's Gozer.
Winston Zeddemore: I thought Gozer was a man.
Dr. Egon Spengler: It's whatever it wants to be.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Well, whatever it is, it's gotta get by us.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Right!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Go get her, Ray!
Dr. Raymond Stantz: We got it.
Hotel Manager: What is it? Will there be any more of them?
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Sir, what you had there is what we refer to as a focused, non-terminal, repeating phantasm or a class-five full-roaming vapor. A real nasty one, too.
Dr. Peter Venkman: And now...
Dr. Peter Venkman: ... let's talk seriously. Now, for the entrapment, we're gonna have to ask you...
Dr. Peter Venkman: ... for four big ones, Four thousand dollars for that. But we are having a special this week on proton charging and storage of the beast...
Dr. Peter Venkman: ... and that's only gonna come to one thousand dollars, fortunately.
Hotel Manager: Five thousand dollars? I had no idea it'd be so much. I won't pay it.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Well, that's all right. We can just put it right back in there. Thank you.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: We certainly can, Dr. Venkman.
Hotel Manager: No, no, NO! All right. Anything.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Thanks so much.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Thank you. Hope we can help you again.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Coming through! One class-five full-roaming vapor. Move 'em out.
Dr. Peter Venkman: What do you think, Egon?
Dr. Egon Spengler: I think this building should be condemned. There's serious metal fatigue in all the load-bearing members, the wiring is substandard, it's completely inadequate for our power needs, and the neighborhood is like a demilitarized zone.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Hey. Does this pole still work?
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Wow. This place is great. When can we move in? You gotta try this pole. I'm gonna get my stuff. Hey. We should stay here. Tonight. Sleep here. You know, to try it out.
Dr. Peter Venkman: I think we'll take it.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Come in. Ray
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Venkman! I saw it! I saw it!
Dr. Peter Venkman: It's right here, Ray. It's looking at me.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: He's an ugly little spud isn't he?
Dr. Peter Venkman: I think he can hear you, Ray.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Don't move! It won't hurt you.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Aaaaaahhh! Aaaaaahhh!
Dana Barrett: You know, you don't act like a scientist.
Dr. Peter Venkman: They're usually pretty stiff.
Dana Barrett: You're more like a game show host.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, no job is too big, no fee is too big!
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Well, this is great. If the ionization-rate is constant for all ectoplasmic entities, we can really bust some heads... in a spiritual sense, of course.
Dr. Peter Venkman: He slimed me.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: That's great. Actual physical contact. Can you move?
Dr. Egon Spengler: Ray, Ray, come in please.
Dr. Peter Venkman: I feel so funky.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Well, there's something you don't see every day.
Louis: Boy, the superintendent's gonna be pissed!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Nice shootin', Tex!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Janine, any calls?
Janine Melnitz: No.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Any messages?
Janine Melnitz: No.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Any customers?
Janine Melnitz: No, Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Peter Venkman: It's a good job, huh?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Type something, will you? We're paying for this stuff! And don't stare at me, you got the bug-eyes.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Janine, sorry about the bug-eyes thing. I'll be in my office.
Dr. Peter Venkman: My friend, don't be a jerk!
Walter Peck: If he does that again, you can shoot him.
Police Captain: You do your job, pencil neck, don't tell me how to do mine!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Thank you, Officer.
Walter Peck: SHUT IT OFF!
Dr. Peter Venkman: All right, I'm gonna turn over the next card. Concentrate... I want you to tell me what you think it is.
Male Student: Uh, square.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Good guess, but wrong.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Okay,
Dr. Peter Venkman: what is this?
Female Student: Is it a star?
Dr. Peter Venkman: It "is" a star,. very good.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Concentrate. Tell me what this is.
Male Student: Circle.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Ooohhh, Close. But most definately wrong.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Clear your head.
Dr. Peter Venkman: what is it?
Female Student: A figure 8.
Dr. Peter Venkman: That's 5 for 5, you can't see these can you?
Female Student: No.
Dr. Peter Venkman: You're not cheating me, are you?
Female Student: No. I swear, they're just coming to me.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Nervous?
Male Student: Yes, I don't like this.
Dr. Peter Venkman: We've only got 75 more to go, c'mon what this one.
Male Student: It's, a couple of wavy lines.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Sorry, this isn't your lucky day.
Male Student: Yeah, I...
Male Student: I uh, uh, I uh, I uh.
Male Student: I'm getting a little tired of this.
Dr. Peter Venkman: You volunteered, didn't you? We're paying you, are we?
Male Student: Yeah, but I didn't know you we're gonna be giving me electric shocks. What are trying to prove here, anyway.
Dr. Peter Venkman: I'm studying the effect on negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
Male Student: Effect? I'll tell you the effect is, it's pissing me off!
Janine Melnitz: I've seen TV, I know you can't come in here without a warrant or writ or something!
Walter Peck: Cease and desist all commerce order, seizure of premises and chattels, ban on use of public utilities for unauthorized waste handlers, and a federal entry and inspection order.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Oh, my *God*. Look at all the junk food!
Dana Barrett: No, goddammit. Look, this wasn't...
Dr. Peter Venkman: You actually eat this stuff?
Dana Barrett: Look, this wasn't here! There was *nothing* here! There was a space and there was a building or something with flames coming out of it, and there were creatures writhing around, and they were growling and snarling. And there were flames, and I heard a voice say "Zuul"! It was right here.
Dr. Peter Venkman: I'm sorry, I'm just not getting any readings.
Dana Barrett: Well, are you sure you're using that thing correctly?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Well, I... I think so, but I'm sure there are no animals in there.
Dana Barrett: Well that's great. Either I have a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
Dr. Peter Venkman: I don't think you're crazy.
Dana Barrett: Oh, good, that makes me feel so much better.
Dr. Peter Venkman: I'm gonna take back some of the things I said about you, Egon.
Dr. Peter Venkman: You... You've earned it
Dr. Egon Spengler: I'm worried, Ray. It's getting crowded in there, and all my recent data points to something big on the horizon.
Winston Zeddemore: What do you mean "big"?
Dr. Egon Spengler: Well...
Dr. Egon Spengler: ...let's say this Twinkie represents the normal amount of psychokinetic energy in the New York area. According to this morning's sample, it would be a twinkie... 35 feet long and weighing approximately 600 pounds.
Winston Zeddemore: That's a big Twinkie.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: We could on the verge of a fourfold cross-reap. A P.K.E. surge of incredible, even dangerous proportions!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Nimble little minx, in't she?
Dr. Egon Spengler: We're gonna go full stream.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Aim for the flattop!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Wasn't so hard.
Dana Barrett: Are you the Keymaster?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Not that I know of.
Dana Barrett: Are you the Keymaster?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Yes. Actually I'm a friend of his, he asked me to meet him here.
Dr. Egon Spengler: Art Deco, very nice.
Dr. Egon Spengler: Venkman, shorten your stream! I don't want my face burned off!
Janine Melnitz: You are so kind to take care of that man. You know, you're a real humanitarian.
Dr. Egon Spengler: I don't think he's human.
Louis: I'm going bring this up with the Tenants' Association. You're not supposed to have pets in the building.
Dr. Peter Venkman: So... what do we do?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Would you come over here, please? That's it, c'mere Francine. What do we do?
Dr. Peter Venkman: STOP THAT!
Dr. Peter Venkman: See ya on the other side, Ray.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman.
Winston Zeddemore: This job is definitely *not* worth eleven-five a year!
Dr. Raymond Stantz: My parents left me that house. I was born there.
Dr. Peter Venkman: You're not gonna lose the house, everybody has three mortgages nowadays.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Hey, Dean Yeager! Are you moving us to a better office on campus?
Dean Yeager: No, you're being moved off campus. The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant. You are to vacate these premises immediately.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: What?
Dr. Peter Venkman: This is preposterous. I demand an explanation.
Dean Yeager: Fine. This university will no longer continue any funding of any kind of your group's activities.
Dr. Peter Venkman: But the kids love us!
Dean Yeager: Doctor... Venkman. We believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind. You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of dodge... or hustle. Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy, and your conclusions are highly questionable! You are a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman!
Dr. Peter Venkman: I see.
Dean Yeager: And you have no place in this department, or this university.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Hello! I'm Peter. Where are you from? Originally.
Library Ghost: Ssshh!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Alright, okay. The usual stuff isn't working.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Okay, I have a plan. I know exactly what to do.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Now, stay close. Stay close. I know; do exactly as I say. Get ready! Ready?
Dr. Raymond Stantz: GET HER!
Louis: This is it! This is the sign!
Janine Melnitz: Yeah, it's a sign, all right. "Going out of business."
Dr. Peter Venkman: I guess the roses worked, huh?
Dana Barrett: Take me now, subcreature.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Egon, your mucus.
Dr. Peter Venkman: To our first custumer.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: To our FIRST and ONLY customer.
Dr. Peter Venkman: I'm gonna need to draw some petty cash. I should take her out to dinner. We don't wanna lose her.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Uhhh... this magnificent feast here represents the LAST of the petty cash.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Slow down. Chew your food.
Male Student: What are you trying to prove here, anyway?
Dr. Peter Venkman: I'm studying the effects of negative reinforcement on ESP ability
Male Student: The effect? I'll tell you what the effect is, it's pissing me off!
Dean Yeager: Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy, and your conclusions are highly questionable. You are a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman!
Dr. Peter Venkman: I think we can get her a guest shot on "Wild Kingdom." I just whacked her up with about 300 cc's of Thorazaine... she's gonna take a little nap now.
Dr. Peter Venkman: You don't think it's too subtle, Marty, you don't think people are going to drive down and not see the sign?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Whoa! Whoa! You can't park right here!
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Everybody can relax, I found the car. Needs some suspension work and shocks. Brakes, brake pads, lining, steering box, transmission, rear-end.
Dr. Peter Venkman: How much?
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Only $4,800.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Also new rings, mufflers, a little wiring.
Archbishop: Lenny, offically the church won't take any postion with the religious implications of these phenomenons. Personally Lenny, I think it's a sign from God, but don't quote me on that.
Dr. Peter Venkman: I think that's a smart move, Mike.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: We've neutronized it, you know what that means? A complete particle reversal.
Winston Zeddemore: We have the tools, and we have the talent!
Dr. Peter Venkman: It's Miller time!
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Oh, I got to get some sleep, I'm dying.
Dr. Peter Venkman: You don't look good.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: I don't?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Well, you've looked better. You didn't used to look like this.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Where are we?
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Looks like we're in the teens... somewhere.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Well, when we get to twenty, tell me... I'm gonna throw up.
Dana Barrett: Louis: Oh, Dana, it's you!
Dana Barrett: Oh hi. Yes Louis, it's me.
Louis: I thought it was the drugstore.
Dana Barrett: Oh, are you sick?
Louis: Oh! No, no, I'm fine, I feel great! Just ordered some more vitamins and stuff. I was just exercising. I taped a 20-minute workout and played it back at high speed on my machine so it only took ten minutes. I got a great workout.
Dana Barrett: Good...
Louis: You wanna come in for a mineral water or something?
Dana Barrett: Oh, I'd really like to, Louis, but I have to go rehearsal now. Excuse me.
Louis: No sweat, I'll take a rain check on that. I always have plenty of low sodium mineral water and other nutritious foods in the house. But you already know that.
Dana Barrett: Yeah, I know that...
Louis: Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a big party for all my clients, my fourth anniversary as an accountant, you know, and even though you do your own tax return, which you shouldn't do, I'd like you to stop by, being that you're my neighbor and all.
Dana Barrett: Well thank you, Louis, I'll really try to stop by.
Louis: Listen, that reminds me, you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out. The creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Dana Barrett: That's strange, I didn't realize I'd left it on.
Louis: Well yeah, you know what I did? I climbed on the ledge and tried to disconnect the cable, but I couldn't get in, so you know what I did? I turned my TV up real loud too so everyone would think all our TVs had something wrong with them.
Dana Barrett: Bye, Louis.
Louis: Okay, so I'll see you later, huh? I'll give you a call! I'm going to go have a shower.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: This is a major disgrace. Forget MIT or Stanford, now. They wouldn't touch us with ten meter caliprod.
Dr. Peter Venkman: You're always concerned about your reputation. Einstein did his best stuff when he was working as a patent clerk.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: You know how much a patent clerk earns?
Dr. Peter Venkman: No!
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Personally, I liked the university. They gave us money and facilities. We didn't have to produce anything! You've never been out of college. You don't know what it's like out there. I worked in the private sector. They expect results.
Dr. Peter Venkman: For whatever reasons, Ray. Call it fate. Call it luck. Call it karma. I believe that everything happens for a reason. I believe that we were destined to get thrown out of this dump.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: For what purpose?
Dr. Peter Venkman: To go into business for ourselves.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: This ecto containment system that Spengler and I have in mind is gonna require a load of bread to capitalize. Where are we gonna get the money?
Dr. Peter Venkman: I don't know. I 'don't' know.
Dr. Peter Venkman: All right, this chick is TOAST. Okay; sticks?
Dr. Raymond Stantz, Dr. Egon Spengler, Winston Zeddemore: HOLDIN'!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Heat 'em up!
Dr. Raymond Stantz, Dr. Egon Spengler, Winston Zeddemore: SMOKIN'!
Dr. Peter Venkman: MAKE 'EM HARD!
Dr. Raymond Stantz, Dr. Egon Spengler, Winston Zeddemore: READY!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Let's show this prehistoric bitch how we do things downtown.
Janine Melnitz: Egon, I tried to stop them. They say they have a warrant.
Dr. Egon Spengler: Excuse me, this is private property.
Walter Peck: Shut this off; shut these all off.
Dr. Egon Spengler: I'm warning you. Turning off these machines would be extremely hazardous.
Walter Peck: No, I'll tell *you* what's hazardous. You're facing Federal prosecution for about a half dozen environmental violations. Now either you shut off these machines, or we'll shut them off for you.
Dr. Egon Spengler: Try to understand, this a high voltage laser containment system. Simply turning it off would be like dropping a bomb on the city.
Walter Peck: Don't patronize me, I'm not grotesquely stupid, like the people you've bilked!
Dr. Peter Venkman: At ease officer. I'm Peter Venkman. I'm a partner in this facility and I'm going to cooperate in any way that I can.
Walter Peck: Forget it, Venkman. You had your chance to cooperate, but you though it would be more fun to insult me. Well, now it's my turn, wiseass.
Dr. Egon Spengler: He wants to shut down the protection grid, Peter.
Dr. Peter Venkman: You shut that thing down, and *we* are not going to be held responsible for whatever happens.
Walter Peck: Oh yes you will, I'll make sure you will.
Dr. Peter Venkman: No, we won't be.
Walter Peck: Shut it off.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Don't shut it off. I'm warning ya.
Con Edison Man: I, I never seen anything like this before. I'm not sure...
Walter Peck: I'm not interested in your opinion, just shut it off.
Dr. Peter Venkman: My friend, don't be a jerk.
Police Sergeant: Step aside.
Walter Peck: If he does that again, you can shoot him.
Police Sergeant: You do *your* job, pencilneck. Don't tell me how to do mine.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Thank you, officer.
Walter Peck: Shut it off!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Maybe now you'll never slime a guy with a positron collider, huh?
Dr. Peter Venkman: As a friend, I have to tell ya you've finally gone around the bend on this ghost business. You guys have been running your ass off, meetin' and greetin' every schizo in the five boroughs who says he has a paranormal experience. What have you seen?
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Of course you forget, Peter. I was present at an undersea, unexplained mass sponge migration.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Ray, the sponges migrated about a foot-and-a-half.
Dr. Peter Venkman: So, what are we doing today, Zuul?
Dana Barrett: We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Gozer huh?
Dana Barrett: The Destructor.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Are we still going out?
Dr. Peter Venkman: I'll take Miss Barrett back to her apartment and check her out.
Dr. Peter Venkman: I'll go check out Miss Barrett's apartment. OK?
Dr. Raymond Stantz: This is a major disgrace. Forget MIT or Stanford now. They wouldn't touch us with a 10-meter cattle prod.
Dr. Peter Venkman: You're always so concerned about your reputation. Einstein did his best stuff when he was working as a patent clerk!
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Do you know how much a patent clerk earns?
Dr. Peter Venkman: No!
Dr. Peter Venkman: They hate this. I like to torture them.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Bye! I'm gonna get him a nice fruit basket.
Dr. Peter Venkman: I'm gonna miss him.
Dr. Egon Spengler: I have a radical idea. The door swings both ways, we could reverse the polarity flow through the gate.
Dr. Peter Venkman: How?
Dr. Egon Spengler: We'll cross the streams.
Dr. Peter Venkman: 'Scuse me Egon? You said crossing the streams was bad!
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Cross the streams...
Dr. Peter Venkman: You're gonna endanger us, you're gonna endanger our client - the nice lady, WHO PAID US IN ADVANCE, before she became a dog...
Dr. Egon Spengler: Not necessarily. There's definitely a VERY SLIM chance we'll survive.
Dr. Peter Venkman: I love this plan! I'm excited it could work! LET'S DO IT!
Dr. Raymond Stantz: This is where we put all the vapors and entities and slimers that we trap. Quite simple really. Load a trap here, open, unlock the system. Insert the trap, release, close, lock the system. Set your entry grid, neutralize your field and... the light is green, the trap is clean! The ghost is incarcerated here in our custom-made storage facility.
Dr. Peter Venkman: We came, we saw, we've kick its ass.
Hotel Manager: You've seen it? What was it?
Dr. Raymond Stantz: We've got it.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Sir, what we have here is what we call a non-repeating phantasm, or a class-5 free roaming vapor, real nasty one too.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Okay.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Let's talk serious, for the entrapment, we're gonna ask you for 4 big ones $4,000 for that, but we are having a special this week on proton charging, and storage of the beast, so we are gonna ask for $1,000 fortunate.
Hotel Manager: $5,000 I had no idea it would be so much, I won't pay it.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Oh, that's okay we can just put it right back in there.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: We most certainly can, Dr. Venkman
Hotel Manager: No, no, NO! Anything.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Thank you. We hope that we can help you again.
Dr. Egon Spengler: The structure of this roof cap is exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker that NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in deep space.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Cold-riveted girders with cores of pure selenium.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Everybody getting this so far? So what? I guess they just don't make them like they used to.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: No!
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Nobody ever made them like this! The architect was either a certified genius, or an authentic wacko.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Ray, for a moment, pretend that I don't know anything about metallurgy, engineering or physics, and just tell me what the hell is going on.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: You never studied. The whole building is a huge superconductive antenna that was designed and built for the purpose of pulling in and concentrating spiritual turbulence. Your girlfriend lives in the corner penthouse of spook central.
Dr. Peter Venkman: She's not my girlfriend. I find her interesting because she's a client and sleeps above her covers. Four feet above her covers. She barks, she drools, she claws...
Dr. Egon Spengler: It's not the girl, Peter, it's the building. Something terrible is about to enter our world, and this building is obviously the door!
Dr. Egon Spengler: The architect's name was Ivo Shandor. I found it in Tobin's Spirit Guide. He was also a doctor. Performed a lot of unnecessary surgery. And then, in 1920, he started a secret society.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Let me guess. Gozer worshipers.
Dr. Egon Spengler: Right.
Dr. Peter Venkman: No studying...
Dr. Egon Spengler: After the First World War, Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive. He wasn't alone. He had close to a thousand followers when he died. They conducted rituals up on the roof, bizarre rituals intended to bring about the end of the world. And now it looks like it may actually happen!
Dr. Peter Venkman: So be good, for goodness sake! Whoa... somebody's coming!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Come in, Ray.
Dr Ray Stantz: Venkman? I saw it, I saw it, I saw it.
Dr. Peter Venkman: It's right here, Ray. It's... looking at me.
Dr Ray Stantz: He's an ugly little spud, isn't he?
Dr. Peter Venkman: I think he can hear you, Ray.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Every ancient religion has its own myth about the end of the world.
Winston Zeddemore: Myth? Ray, has it ever occurred to you that maybe the reason we've been so busy lately is because the dead HAVE been rising from the grave?
Dr. Raymond Stantz: How 'bout a little music?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Are you currently menstruating?
Library Administrator: What has that got to do with anything?
Dr. Peter Venkman: Back off man, I'm a scientist.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: This is where we store all the vapors and entities and slimers that we trap. Very simple, really. A loaded trap here... open, unlock the system... insert the trap... release... close, lock the system. Set your entry grid... neutronize your field... and...
Dr. Raymond Stantz: ...when the light is green, the trap is clean. The ghost is incarcerated here in our custom-made storage facility.
Dr. Peter Venkman: oh, wait, wait, i've always wanted to do this! and...
Dr. Peter Venkman: the flowers are still standing!
Dr. Peter Venkman: Janine, any messages?
Janine Melnitz: No.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Any calls?
Janine Melnitz: No.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Any customers?
Janine Melnitz: No, Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Good job, isn't it? Type something will ya, we're paying for this stuff,
Dr. Peter Venkman: and don't stare at me you got the *bug eyes*. Janine, sorry about the bug eyes thing I'll be in my office.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Gozer the Gozerian, good evening. As a duly designated representative of the city, county, and state of New York, I order you to cease any and all supernatural activity and return forthwith to your place of origin or to the nearest convenient parallel dimension.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Come on.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Dr. Peter Venkman: Whoa! Hold it!
Chambermaid: What the HELL are you doing?
Dr. Egon Spengler: Sorry.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Sorry.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: I'm Sorry.
Dr. Peter Venkman: We thought you were someone else. Successful test.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: I guess so. I think we'd better split up.
Dr. Egon Spengler: Good idea.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Yeah, we can do more damage that way.
Larry King: Hi, this is Larry King. The phone-in topic Today: "Ghosts and Ghostbusting." The controversy builds, more sightings are reported, some maintain that these professional paranormal eliminators in New York are the cause of it all.
Casey Kasem: Still making headlines all across the country, the Ghostbusters are at it again. This time, at the fashionable dance club, "The Rose." The boys in gray slugged it out with a pretty pesky poltergeist, then stayed on to dance the night away with some of the lovely ladies who witnessed the disturbance. This is Casey Kasem. Now, on with the countdown.
Louis: I am The Keymaster!
Dana Barrett: I am The Gatekeeper!
Dr. Raymond Stantz: A full torso apparition, and it's real.
Jail Guard: Okay, Ghostbusters. The mayor wants to see you guys. The whole island's going crazy. Let's go.
Dr. Peter Venkman: I gotta split. The mayor wants to rap with me about some things.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Your honor, our system was working just fine until the power grid was turned off by wally wick here.
Walter Peck: They caused an explosion!
Mayor: Is this true?
Dr. Peter Venkman: It's true, your honor. The man is some kind of rodent, I don't know which.
Dr Ray Stantz: I tried to think of the most harmless thing. Something I loved from my childhood. Something that could never, ever possibly destroy us. Mr. Stay Puft.
Dr. Peter Venkman: Nice thinking, Ray.
Roger Grimsby: Good morning, I'm Roger Grimsby. Today, the entire Eastern Seaboard is alive with talk of incidents of paranormal activity. Alleged ghost sightings and related supernatural occurances have been reported across the entire Tri-State area.
Dr. Peter Venkman: All right, I'm gonna turn over the next card. Concentrate... I want you to tell me what you think it is.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Personally, I liked working for the university! They gave us money and facilities. We didn't have to produce anything. You've never been out of college. You don't know what it's like out there! I've worked in the private sector... they expect results!
Janine Melnitz: Is it just a mist, or does it have arms and legs?
Louis: Nice doggy. Cute little pooch. Maybe I've got a Milk-Bone.
Dr. Raymond Stantz: Alright boys... Ready? Throw it!
Dr. Raymond Stantz: I did that, I did that... That's my fault.
Dr. Peter Venkman: It's OK; the table broke the fall.
Dr. Egon Spengler: I blame myself.
TV Reporter: Well, everybody's heard ghost stories around the campfire. Heck, my grandma used to spin yarns about a spectral locomotive that would rocket past the farm where she grew up! But now, as if some unforeseen authority...
Walter Peck: Shut these off. Shut these all off!
Dr. Peter Venkman: You're the best one on your row.
