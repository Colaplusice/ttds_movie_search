Dutch: You're one... *ugly* motherfucker!
Dutch: RUN, GO... GET TO THE CHOPPER!
Poncho: You're bleeding, man. You're hit.
Blain: I ain't got time to bleed.
Poncho: Oh... Okay.
Poncho: You got time to duck?
Dutch: Stick around.
Dutch: What the hell *are* you?
The Predator: What the hell are *you*?
Dutch: If it bleeds, we can kill it.
Dutch: Come on... Come on! Do it! Do it! Come on. Come on! Kill me! I'm here! Kill me! I'm here! Kill me! Come on! Kill me! I'm here! Come on! Do it now! Kill me!
Blain: Bunch of slack-jawed faggots around here. This stuff will make you a god damned sexual Tyrannosaurus, just like me.
Poncho: Yeah, strap this on your "sore ass", Blain.
Dutch: Knock-knock.
Mac: You're ghostin' us, motherfucker. I don't care who you are back in the world, you give away our position one more time, I'll bleed ya, real quiet. Leave ya here. Got that?
Billy: I'm scared Poncho.
Poncho: Bullshit. You ain't afraid of no man.
Billy: There's something out there waiting for us, and it ain't no man. We're all gonna die.
Mac: Here we are again, bro... Just you and me. Same kind of moon, same kind of jungle. Real number 10, remember? Whole platoon, 32 men chopped into meat... We walk out, just you and me, nobody else. Right on top, huh? Not a scratch... Not a fuckin' scratch. You know, who ever got you, they'll come back again. And when he does, I'm gonna cut your name right into him... I'm gonna cut your name into him!
Blain: Son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tick.
Anna: When I was little, we found a man. He looked like - like, butchered. The old women in the village crossed themselves, and whispered crazy things, strange things. "El diablo cazador de hombres". Only in the hottest years this happens. And this year, it grows hot. We begin finding our men. We found them sometimes without their skin... and sometimes much, much worst. "El que hace trofeos de los hombres" means "the demon who makes trophies of men".
Dutch: So why don't you use the regular army? What do you need us for?
Dillon: 'Cause some damn fool accused you of being the best.
Dutch: Dillon! You son of a bitch!
Dutch: What's the matter? The CIA got you pushing too many pencils? Huh? Had enough?
Dillon: Make it easy on yourself, Dutch.
Dillon: OK, OK, OK!
Dutch: You never did know when to quit, huh?
Dillon: Damned good to see ya, Dutch.
Dutch: What is this fucking tie business?
Dillon: Aw, come on, forget about my tie, man.
The Predator: Anytime.
Hawkins: Billy. Billy! The other day, I was going down on my girlfriend. I said to her, "Jeez you got a big pussy. Jeez you got a big pussy." She said, "Why did you say that twice?" I said, "I didn't."
Hawkins: See, 'cause of the echo.
Dutch: He came to get the body. He's killing us one at a time.
Billy: Like a hunter.
Dutch: He's using the trees.
Poncho: Major, you'd better take a look at this.
Dutch: Did you find Hawkins?
Poncho: I... I can't tell.
Dutch: Run! Get to the chopper!
Dutch: What happened to you, Dillon? You used to be someone I could trust.
Dillon: I woke up. Why don't you? You're an asset. An expendable asset. And I used you to get the job done, got it?
Hawkins: Hey Billy. Billy! The other day, I went up to my girlfriend, I said, "Y'know I'd like a little pussy". She said, "Me too, mine's as big as a house!"
Hawkins: See, she, she wanted a little one 'cause hers was...
Hawkins: ... big as a house.
Dutch: What's got Billy so spooked?
Mac: Can't say, Major. Been actin' squirrelly all morning. That damned nose of his... it's weird.
Dutch: What is it? Billy? What the hell is wrong with you?
Billy: There's something in those trees.
Dutch: Do you see anything?
Billy: Up there ahead.
Dutch: Nothing. What do you think?
Billy: I guess it's nothing, Major.
Dutch: We're a rescue team. Not assassins.
Dutch: My men are not expendable. And I don't do this kind of work.
Mac: Long Tall Sally, she built sweet, she got everything, that Uncle John need. Aw baby, I'm gonna have me some fun, I'm gonna have me some fun, I'm gonna have me some fun.
Poncho: She says the jungle... it just came alive and took him.
Dutch: Bleed, bastard.
Dutch: Leave it. He didn't kill you because you weren't armed. No sport.
Dutch: Yesterday, what did you see?
Dillon: You're wasting your time.
Dutch: No more games.
Anna: I don't know what it was. It...
Dutch: Go on.
Anna: It changed colors, like the chameleon, it uses the jungle.
Dillon: You saying that Blain and Hawkins were killed by a fucking lizard? That's a bullshit psyche job. There's two to three men out there at the most. Fucking lizard.
Dutch: What's your name?
Anna: Anna.
Dutch: Anna, this thing is hunting us. *All* of us. You know that?
Dillon: Look, we've been looking for this place for months. My men were in that chopper when it got hit! Hopper's orders were to go in and get my men and he disappeared.
Dutch: He didn't disappear. He was skinned alive!
Dutch: You set us up. It was bullshit, all of it.
Mac: Goddamn! Shew. Buddy buddy-buddy-buddy-buddy. I've seen some bad-ass bush before, man, but nothin' like this.
Blain: I hear ya. This shit's somethin'. Makes Cambodia look like Kansas.
Mac: Hey, que pasa, amigo? Little taste of home.
Blain: You lose it here, you're in a world of hurt.
Dutch: She's your baggage. You fall behind, and you're on your own.
Lyrics: Gonna tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John. Claims he has a-misery but he has a lot of fun. Oh, baby. Ye-e-e-es, baby. Whoo-oo-oo-oo, baby. A-havin' me some fun tonight. Yeah. Well, Long Tall Sally, she's built sweet. She got everything that Uncle John need. Oh, baby. Ye-e-e-es, baby. Whoo-oo-oo-oo, baby. A-havin' me some fun tonight. Yeah. Well, I saw Uncle John with bald-head Sally. He saw Aunt Mary comin' and he ducked back in the alley. Oh, baby. Ye-e-e-es, baby. Whoo-oo-oo-oo, baby. Havin' me some fun tonght. Yeah. A-whoo!
Dillon: Hold it Dutch, I'm going after Mac.
Dutch: That's not your style, Dillon.
Dillon: I guess I picked up some bad habbits from you, now get your people the hell out of here.
Dutch: You can't win this Dillon.
Dillon: Maybe I can get even.
Dutch: Dillon.
Dillon: Just hold on to that goddamn chopper.
Dutch: So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us in a meatgrinder?
Mac: I see you!
Dillon: Goddamn jackpot. This is more than we ever thought we'd get. We finally got those bastards. We got 'em.
Mac: Hey, Dillon.
Dillon: Thanks!
Mac: Anytime...
Blain: Payback time.
Mac: Time to let Ol' Painless' out of the bag.
Dutch: Mac, any sign of the other hostages?
Mac: Found the other hostage. He's dead, too. And the kid in the chopper. If these guys are Central Americans then I'm a goddamn Chinaman. From the looks of things, our Cabinet Minister was CIA. Another thing, Major: those other guys you waxed were Russian Military Advisors. Something very big was going to happen here.
Dutch: Good work, Mac. Clear the area; leave no traces. Go get the other men.
Mac: Right.
Mac: I know one thing, Major. I drew down and fired straight at it. Capped off two hundred rounds in the minigun, full pack. Nothing... nothing on this earth could have lived. Not at that range.
Dutch: He's killing us one at a time.
Major General Phillips: My god.
Blain: You lose it here, you're in a world of hurt.
Dutch: No powder burns. No shrapnel.
Dillon: The wound's all fused, cauterized. What the hell could have done this to a man?
Billy: He's busted up pretty bad, Major.
Poncho: I can make it! I can make it.
Dutch: We move, five meter spread, no sound.
Poncho: Jesus, you killed a pig... Think you could'a found something bigger?
Mac: Fuck you, Poncho! Fuck you!
Dutch: Yesterday, what did you see?
Dillon: You're wasting your time.
Dutch: No more games!
Anna: I don't know what it was. It...
Dutch: Go on.
Anna: It changed colours, like the chameleon, it uses the jungle.
Dillon: You saying that Blain and Hawkins were killed by a fucking lizard? That's a bullshit psyche job. There is two to three men out there at the most. Fucking lizard.
Poncho: Not a thing. Not a fucking trace. No blood, no bodies... We hit nothing!
Dillon: So, what are you gonna try next? Cheese?
Dutch: This cabinet minister: does he always travel on the wrong side of the border?
Major General Phillips: Apparently they strayed off course. And we're fairly certain they're in guerrilla hands.
Dutch: Who's our backup?
Dillon: No such thing, ol' buddy. This is a one-way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
Dutch: This is getting better by the minute.
Dillon: I don't know, Dutch. This is inhuman.
Anna: Déme el arma. Déme el arma! Give me the weapon!
Dutch: My team works alone, you know that.
Poncho: Maybe you better put her on a leash, Agent-man.
Dillon: Never knew how much I missed this, Dutch.
Dutch: You never were that smart.
Blain: Come on in, you fuckers. Come on in. Ol' Painless is waitin'.
Dutch: You still don't understand, Dillon, do you? Whatever it is out there, it killed Hopper, and now it wants us.
Dutch: Hey Billy, give me a way out of this hole. Aerial says we are cut off.
Billy: The only way outta here is that valley that leads to the east. But I wouldn't risk that on a broke-dick dog.
Dutch: Not much choice.
Billy: I don't believe he did; I can't find a single track.
Dutch: What about the rest of Hopper's men?
Billy: There's no sign, sir. They never left here. Hell, it's like they just disappeared.
Dillon: That's a real nasty habit you got there.
Dutch: What's the matter? The CIA got you pushing too many pencils? Huh? Had enough?
Dillon: Make it easy on yourself, Dutch.
Dillon: OK, OK, OK!
Dillon: Dutch, the General's sayin' that a couple of our friends are about to get squeezed, and we can't let that happen. We need the best. That's why you're here.
Dutch: Go on.
Dillon: Simple setup. One-day operation. We pick up their trail at the chopper, run 'em down, grab those hostages and bounce back across the border before anybody knows we were there.
Dutch: Whaddya mean "we"?
Major General Phillips: You're looking good, Dutch.
Dutch: It's been a long time, General.
Major General Phillips: Come on inside.
Blain: Son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tick.
