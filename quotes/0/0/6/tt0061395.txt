Madame Anais: I have an idea. Would you like to be called "Belle de Jour"?
Séverine Serizy: Belle de Jour?
Madame Anais: Since you only come in the afternoons.
Séverine Serizy: If you wish.
Séverine Serizy: Pierre, please, don't let the cats out.
Asian client: I will pump you once for good! I will pump you once for good! I will pump you once for good!
Renee: You look bored. Don't let me keep you.
Henri Husson: One's never bored in a bar, unlike in a church, alone with one's own soul.
Pierre Serizy: You go in. The women are there. You pick one. You spend half an hour alone with her and after you leave, you're depressed all day. But what can you do? Semen retentum venenum est.
Madame Anais: I'm not asking for your real name. You think mine is really Anaïs?
Madame Anais: We'll have a little something to celebrate your arrival.
Séverine Serizy: No, thank you.
Madame Anais: I insist. Cherries in brandy.
Pierre Serizy: Shall I tell you a secret, Séverine?
Pierre Serizy: I'd like everything to be perfect too. If only you weren't so cold.
Séverine Serizy: Please don't mention that again.
Pierre Serizy: I didn't mean to upset you. I feel a great tenderness for you.
Séverine Serizy: What good is your tenderness to me?
Pierre Serizy: You can be very cruel when you wish.
Séverine Serizy: How dare you! Let me go! You brutes! Let go of me! It's not my fault. I can explain everything.
Pierre Serizy: Go on. Don't worry about roughing up the little slut! Hurry!
Séverine Serizy: Forgive me.
Henri Husson: You should see a specialist about your obsessions.
Renee: He's rich and idle. Those are his two main illnesses.
Henri Husson: Don't forget the hunt. I also have a special weakness for the poor. I think of them when it snows, with no fur coats, no hope, no nothing.
Pierre Serizy: I like him. He's amusing.
Séverine Serizy: He's strange.
Renee: Worse than that.
Renee: You remember Henriette?
Séverine Serizy: Yes, very well.
Renee: It seems - she's turning tricks.
Séverine Serizy: What?
Renee: In one of those houses. They say she's there several days a week. Can you believe it? Henriette! Of course, that's all so far from your world. But, can you imagine? A woman like you or me? Can you see her going with just anybody? In those places you don't get to choose. Old or not, lousy looking or not. Even with a man you love it can be unpleasant.
Henri Husson: The mysterious Henriette! The woman with two faces. A double life. How intriguing! Did Renée tell you?
Séverine Serizy: Yes. But why?
Henri Husson: Simple: for the money.
Séverine Serizy: I can't understand women like that.
Henri Husson: It's the oldest profession in the world. It's mostly arranged by phone now, but the women in those houses are a special breed.
Séverine Serizy: I'm sure you know them well.
Henri Husson: Yes, I used to go a lot. I enjoyed it. There's a very special atmosphere. The women are complete slaves. I remember a few around the Opéra. Especially one run by Anaïs. 11 cité Jean de Saumur. I have marvelous memories.
Madame Anais: You're nice and fresh. Just what they like here. I know it's hard at first, but who doesn't need money now and then? We'll split it fifty-fifty. I have my expenses.
Séverine Serizy: Thank you very much, but I must be going.
Madame Anais: Come on. You're just a bit nervous. I bet it's the first time you've worked. It's not really so awful.
Madame Anais: You'll meet the other two girls soon. Mathilde and Charlotte. Both very nice. I only tolerate well-bred people here and they must be cheerful. I want people to enjoy their work. Just last week I had to let a girl go. Very beautiful, too. But she was too vulgar. It's a shame.
Madame Anais: You look a bit nervous. Relax. You'll be out at 5:00. Don't worry. You have someone waiting for you? A boyfriend? A husband? Oh, don't think I'm prying. Kiss me.
Monsieur Adolphe: The other day in Brussels I had a black girl. What a time we had!
Monsieur Adolphe: I like ham and sausage, I like ham when it's good, But I like even more a nice pair of thighs.
Monsieur Adolphe: It wasn't cold enough. Champagne over 46 degrees taste like tea.
Madame Anais: Sorry. If I'd known, I'd have put it in the fridge.
Monsieur Adolphe: You knew I was coming.
Madame Anais: But not that Belle de jour was.
Monsieur Adolphe: To the person I care most about - - me!
Madame Anais: And to Belle de jour.
Madame Anais: You're doing fine. You're a big hit already. Mr. Adolphe is a simple man, so don't get upset. Do what he wants. That's all he asks.
Séverine Serizy: No, I want to go.
Madame Anais: What? You about done putting on airs? Where do you think you are? Go on!
Madame Anais: It seems you need a firm hand, eh?
Monsieur Adolphe: No, you're not running off now! Who do you think you are, you little slut?
Monsieur Adolphe: You get me excited and then pull me up short?
Monsieur Adolphe: You can put on airs for a while, but I've had enough!
Monsieur Adolphe: There. See? That's more like it. So, you need the rough stuff, do you?
Henri Husson: How's your wife?
Pierre Serizy: Very well, thanks.
Henri Husson: Where is she?
Pierre Serizy: Right over there. Want to say hello?
Henri Husson: I'd love to. How are you little slut?
Pierre Serizy: Everything okay, you tramp?
Henri Husson: Old whore!
Pierre Serizy: Maggot!
Henri Husson: Sodomite!
Pierre Serizy: Scum!
Henri Husson: Fellatomane! Tramp! Harlot!
Prof. Henri: I love you. I love you, I tell you. Now walk on me. Spit on me. Stomp on my face.
Charlotte: Dirty old man! Pig! I'll teach you!
Prof. Henri: But I love you! Marquise, hit me harder!
Madame Anais: What's that? Credit card. Geisha Club. No-no. This is no good here. Cash only.
Duke: What's your name?
Séverine Serizy: Belle de jour.
Duke: Charming. I once had a cat named Dark Beauty. Do you come here often?
Séverine Serizy: Everyday in my thoughts.
Duke's Butler: Monsieur Duke, shall I let the cats in?
Duke: To hell with you and your cats!
Séverine Serizy: Who's Hippolyte?
Charlotte: Wait and see. An odd sort of guy.
Mathilde: When he has money he throws it around.
Charlotte: And when he's broke, he wants it for free.
Madame Anais: Come on, girls. All three of you.
Hyppolite: How's the little girl?
Pallas: Fine, sir.
Hyppolite: Big enough to be tickled yet?
Charlotte: Where have you been?
Hyppolite: Traveling in New York. Business. Put three bottles on ice. The good stuff.
Madame Anais: My best.
Hyppolite: From Paris straight to heaven. What I miss most abroad is French champagne and sexy gals like you.
Hyppolite: I'd slit my father's throat for less, but friendship comes first. We're not gonna fight over some slut, eh?
Marcel: How old are you?
Séverine Serizy: Twenty-three.
Marcel: Leave your stockings on. A girl tried to strangle me once. Poor thing.
Séverine Serizy: If you like, I won't charge you.
Marcel: Naturally. Plenty of girls would love to be in your place.
Marcel: Still won't tell me your name? You're not much of a talker. Fine with me. Girls that talk are a pain. Not bad. Too bad you've only got two. Let's have a look. Turn over.
Pierre Serizy: You're always to distant. I've never felt you really close to me.
Hyppolite: The snow. We know you've got it.
Hyppolite: Broads - what a curse!
Marcel: I don't get it. You seem to like being with me.
Séverine Serizy: Very much, but it's not enough.
Marcel: You love the other guy?
Marcel: Then why are you here?
Séverine Serizy: I don't know. They're two different things.
Séverine Serizy: Don't tell Pierre.
Henri Husson: Pierre? I admire him more and more.
Séverine Serizy: Please don't tell him. At least try to understand. I'm lost. I can't help it. I can't fight it. I know I'll have to atone for everything one day. But I couldn't live without it. Fine! Do as you like with me!
Henri Husson: No. Not now, anyway. I guess what attracted me about you was your virtue. You were the wife of a boy scout. That's all changed now. I have principals, unlike you.
