Hiccup: I really did hit one.
Gobber: Sure.
Hiccup: He never listens!
Gobber: Well, it runs in the family.
Hiccup: And when he does, it's always with this... disappointed scowl, like someone skimped on the meat in his sandwich.
Hiccup: "Excuse me, barmaid! I'm afraid you brought me the wrong offspring! I ordered an extra-large boy with beefy arms, extra guts and glory on the side. This here, this is a talking fish-bone!"
Gobber: Now, you're thinkin' about this all wrong. It's not so much what you *look* like, it's what's *inside* that he can't stand.
Hiccup: Thank you for summing that up.
Gobber: Look the point is, stop trying so hard to be something you're not!
Hiccup: I just wanna be one of you guys!
Hiccup: This is Berk. It snows nine months of the year, and hails the other three. Any food that grows here is tough and tasteless. The people that grow here are even more so. The only upsides are the pets. While other places have ponies or parrots... we have... dragons.
Astrid: I bet he's really frightened now... what are you gonna do about it?
Hiccup: Ehhh... probably something stupid.
Astrid: Good, but you've already done that...
Hiccup: Then something crazy...!
Astrid: *That's* more like it!
Astrid: It's a mess. You must feel horrible. You've lost everything. Your father, your tribe, your best friend...
Hiccup: Thank you for summing that up.
Hiccup: Why couldn't I have killed that dragon when I found him in the woods? Would've been better, for everyone...
Astrid: Yep. The rest of us would have done it. So why didn't you?
Astrid: Why didn't you?
Hiccup: I don't know... I couldn't.
Astrid: That's not an answer.
Hiccup: *Why* is this so important to you all of a sudden?
Astrid: Because I want to remember what you say, *right now*.
Hiccup: Oh, for the love of... I was a coward! I was weak! I wouldn't kill a dragon!
Astrid: You said *wouldn't*, that time.
Hiccup: Agh, whatever... I *wouldn't*! Three hundred years, and I'm the first Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon!
Astrid: First to ride one, though. So...?
Hiccup: I wouldn't kill him, because he looked as frightened as *I* was. I looked at him... and I saw myself.
Astrid: That's for kidnapping me.
Astrid: That's for everything else.
Astrid: That's for scaring me!
Hiccup: Oh wha- wait, what is it always going to be this way? 'Cause...
Hiccup: ...I could get used to it.
Hiccup: Everything we know about you guys is wrong.
Astrid: Hiccup! Get me *down* from here!
Hiccup: You have to give me a chance to explain!
Astrid: I am not listening to *anything* you have to say!
Hiccup: Then I won't speak. Just let me *show* you. Please, Astrid.
Astrid: Now get me down.
Hiccup: Toothless, down. *Gently.*
Hiccup: See? Nothing to be afraid of...
Hiccup: Augh! Toothless! What is *wrong* with you? Bad dragon! A-ha, he's uh, he's not usually like this... Oh no...
Hiccup: Toothless, what are you doing, we need her to *like* us!
Hiccup: And now, the spinning. Thank you for *nothing*, you useless reptile!
Astrid: Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Just get me off of this thing!
Hiccup: You got it, bud.
Stoick: Hiccup!... I'm sorry. For-for everything.
Hiccup: Yeah, me too.
Stoick: You don't have to go up there.
Hiccup: We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard.
Stoick: I'm proud to call you my son.
Hiccup: Thanks, Dad.
Stoick: Thank you, for saving my son.
Gobber: Well, you know... *most* of him.
Hiccup: This is Berk. It's twelve days north of Hopeless and a few degrees south of Freezing to Death. It's located solidly on the Meridian of Misery. My village. In a word? Sturdy. It's been here for seven generations, but every single building is new. We have fishing, hunting, and a charming view of the sunsets. The only problems are the pests. You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes... We have...
Hiccup: Dragons!
Hiccup: We're leaving! Let's pack up. Looks like you and me are taking a little vacation. Forever.
Hiccup: Ah man.
Hiccup: Agh! What the... uh, uh, what are you doing here?
Astrid: I want to know what's going on.
Astrid: No one just *gets* as good as you do. *Especially* you. Start talking! Are you training with someone?
Hiccup: Uh, uh, training? I didn't...
Astrid: It better not involve *this*...
Hiccup: I, I know, this... looks really bad, but, you see, this is uh...
Hiccup: Uh, you're right! You're right, you're right. I, I'm through with the lies, I've been making... outfits! So, you got me. It's time everyone knew. Drag me back, go ahead... here we go...
Hiccup: OW! Why would you *do* that?
Astrid: That's for the lies! And *that's*...
Astrid: ... for everything else!
Hiccup: Oh man...
Astrid: Get down!
Astrid: RUN! RUN!
Hiccup: No! No! It's okay, it's okay!
Hiccup: She's a friend.
Hiccup: You scared him.
Astrid: *I* scared *him*? Who is "him"?
Hiccup: Uh... Astrid, Toothless! Toothless, Astrid.
Hiccup: Duh-duh-duh, we're dead!
Fishlegs: I'm okay!
Fishlegs: Less okay!
Snotlout: Watch out babe, I'll take care of this.
Snotlout: The *sun* was in my eyes, Astrid! What do you want me to do, block out the sun? I can do that, but I don't have the time right now!
Stoick: Turns out all we needed was a little more of...
Stoick: This!
Hiccup: You just gestured to all of me!
Tuffnut: Ooooh, love on the battlefield!
Ruffnut: She could do better.
Stoick: Oh, son... I did this.
Stoick: I'm s... I'm so sorry.
Stoick: Hiccup!
Stoick: Ah, he's *alive*! You brought him back alive!
Hiccup: My name's Hiccup. Great name, I know. But, it's not the worst. Parents believe a hideous name will frighten off gnomes and trolls. Like our charming Viking demeanor wouldn't do that.
Viking: RAAAAHHHR!
Viking: Morning!
Hiccup: Most people would leave. Not us. We're Vikings. We... have stubbornness issues.
Fishlegs: If you're planning on getting eaten, I'd definitely go with the Gronkle.
Tuffnut: You were wise to seek help from the world's most deadly weapon...
Hiccup: Um...
Tuffnut: It's me.
Snotlout: I love this plan!
Hiccup: I... didn't...
Ruffnut: You're crazy!
Ruffnut: I like that...
Astrid: So... what is the plan?
Astrid: Stay out of my way! I'm winning this thing!
Hiccup: Uh... please, by all means.
Astrid: This time! This time, for sure!
Astrid: NO! YOU SON OF A HALF-TROLL, RAT-EATING, MUNGE-BUCKET!
Astrid: All right, I admit it. This is pretty cool. It's... *amazing*. He's amazing.
Hiccup: Huh. Toothless. I could've sworn you had...
Hiccup: ...Teeth.
Hiccup: Oh, the gods hate me. Some people lose their knife or their mug... No, not me, I manage to lose an entire *dragon*?
Hiccup: Dragon classifications. Strength Class, Fear Class, Mystery Class. Thunderdrum: This reclusive dragon inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools. When startled, the Thunderdrum produces a concussive sound that can kill a man at close range. Extremely dangerous, kill on sight.
Hiccup: Timberjack: This gigantic creature has razor-sharp wings that can slice through full-grown trees. Extremely dangerous, kill on sight.
Hiccup: Scaldron: Sprays scalding water at its victim, extremely dangerous...
Hiccup: Changeling: Even newly hatched dragons can spray acid, kill on sight.
Hiccup: Gronkles, Zippleback, the Skrill... Boneknapper... Whispering Death... Burns its victims, buries its victims, chokes its victims, turns its victims inside-out... Extremely dangerous, extremely dangerous... kill on sight, kill on sight, kill on sight... Night Fury. Speed unknown. Size unknown. The unholy offspring of lightning and death itself. Never engage this dragon. Your only chance: hide and pray it does not find you.
Hiccup: Aw, come on, let me out, please? I need to make my mark!
Gobber: Oh, you've made plenty of marks! All in the wrong places!
Hiccup: Please, two minutes! I'll kill a dragon, my life will get infinitely better... I might even get a date!
Gobber: You can't lift a hammer, you can't swing an axe, you can't even throw one of these!
Hiccup: Okay fine, but this will throw it for me!
Gobber: See, now this right here is what I'm talkin' about!
Hiccup: It, it... mild calibration issue, I...
Gobber: Don't you... no, Hiccup! If you ever want to get out there to fight dragons, you need to stop all... this.
Hiccup: But you just pointed to all of me!
Gobber: Yes! That's it! Stop being all of you!
Hiccup: Oh...
Gobber: Oh, yeah!
Hiccup: You, sir, are playing a dangerous game! Keeping this much raw... viking-ness... contained! There'll be consequences!
Gobber: I'll take my chances.
Gobber: Sword. Sharpened. Now.
Tuffnut: Get your hands off my shield!
Ruffnut: There's like a million shields!
Tuffnut: Take that one, it has a flower on it. Girls like flowers.
Ruffnut: Oops! Now this one has blood on it.
Gobber: Look for its blind spot! Every dragon has one. Find it, hide in it, and strike!
Ruffnut: Whoa! Do you *ever* bathe?
Tuffnut: You don't like it, then just get your own blind spot!
Ruffnut: How about I give *you* one...!
Gobber: Blind spot, yes. Deaf spot... Not so much.
Hiccup: I... don't wanna fight dragons.
Stoick: Oh, come on, yes you do.
Hiccup: Rephrase: Dad, I *can't* kill dragons.
Stoick: But you *will* kill dragons!
Hiccup: No, I'm really, very extra sure that I *won't*.
Stoick: It's time, Hiccup...
Hiccup: Can you not *hear* me?
Stoick: This is *serious*, son. When you carry this axe, you carry all of us with you. Which means, you walk like us, you talk like us, and you think like us. No more of... this!
Hiccup: You just gestured to *all* of me.
Stoick: Deal?
Hiccup: This conversation is feeling very one-sided...
Stoick: *Deal*?
Hiccup: Deal.
Stoick: Hiccup.
Hiccup: Dad! Uh, I have to talk to you, Dad.
Stoick: I need to speak with you too, son.
Stoick: I think it's time you learned to fight dragons.
Hiccup: I've decided I don't want to fight dragons.
Stoick, Hiccup: What?
Stoick: Uh, you go first.
Hiccup: No no, no, *you* go first.
Stoick: All right. You get your wish. Dragon training. You start in the morning.
Hiccup: Oh, man, I should have gone first... Because, I was thinking, you know, we have a surplus of dragon-fighting Vikings, but do we have enough... *bread-making* Vikings, or small home-repair Vikings...?
Hiccup: Thanks for stopping by and for the, uh, the breast-hat...
Fishlegs: AHHH! I'm *really* beginning to question your teaching methods.
Snotlout: If that dragon shows either of its faces, I'm gonna... there!
Ruffnut, Astrid: AH!
Ruffnut: Hey! It's us, idiots!
Tuffnut: Your butts are getting bigger! We thought you were a dragon!
Snotlout: Not that there's anything wrong with a dragon-esque fig...
Stoick: What am I going to do with him, Gobber?
Gobber: Put 'im in training with the others.
Stoick: No, I'm serious!
Gobber: So am I!
Stoick: He'd be killed before you let the first dragon out of its cage!
Gobber: Ah, you don't know that.
Stoick: I do know that.
Gobber: No you don't.
Stoick: No, actually, I do.
Gobber: No, you don't!
Stoick: Listen, you know what he's like. From the time he could crawl he's been... different. He doesn't listen, he has the attention span of a sparrow... I take him fishing and he goes hunting for, for trolls!
Gobber: Trolls exist! They steal your socks. But only the left ones. What's with that?
Stoick: When I was a boy...
Gobber: Oh here we go.
Stoick: ...my father told me to bang my head against a rock and I did it! I thought I was crazy, but I didn't question him. And you know what happened?
Gobber: You got a headache.
Stoick: That rock split in two! It taught me what a Viking can do, Gobber, he can, he can crush mountains, level forests, tame seas! Even as a boy, I knew what I was, what I had to become... Hiccup is not that boy.
Gobber: You can't stop him, Stoick. You can only prepare him. I know it seems hopeless, but the truth is you won't always be around to protect him! He's going to get out there again. He's probably out there now!
Stoick: Your mother would have wanted you to have it. It's half of her breastplate.
Stoick: Matching set. Keeps her... keeps her close, you know.
Gobber: Oh, nice of you to join the party! I thought you'd been carried off!
Hiccup: Who, me? Nah, come on! I'm way too muscular for their taste! They wouldn't know what to do with... all this!
Gobber: Well, they need toothpicks, don't they?
Gobber: Today is about survival. If you get blasted, you're dead. Quick! What's the first thing you're going to need?
Hiccup: A doctor?
Fishlegs: Plus five speed?
Astrid: A shield!
Gobber: Shield! Go!
Gobber: Your most important piece of equipment is your shield! If you must make a choice between a sword or a shield, take the shield!
Gobber: Remember, a dragon will always, *always*... go for the kill.
Hiccup: So why didn't you?
Stoick: Either we finish them, or they'll finish us! It's the only way we'll be rid of them! If we find the nest and destroy it, the dragons will leave. They'll find another home! One more search, before the ice sets in.
Viking: Those ships never come back!
Stoick: We're Vikings! It's an occupational hazard. So, who's with me?
Stoick: All right. Those who stay will look after Hiccup.
Viking: To the ships!
Viking: I'm with you, Stoick!
Stoick: Aye, that's more like it.
Gobber: Behind these doors are just a few of the many species you will learn to fight. The Deadly Nadder...
Fishlegs: Speed Eight, Armor Sixteen...
Gobber: The Hideous Zippleback...
Fishlegs: Plus Eleven Stealth, times Two...
Gobber: The Monstrous Nightmare...
Fishlegs: Firepower Fifteen...
Gobber: The Terrible Terror...
Fishlegs: Attack Eight, Venom Twelve...
Gobber: Can you stop that?
Gobber: And... the Gronckle!
Fishlegs: Jaw Strength Eight.
Hiccup: Oh, wow... I-I did it! Oh, I did it! This, this fixes everything! *Yes*! I have brought down this mighty beast...!
Hiccup: I'm gonna kill you dragon. I'm gonna... I'm gonna cut out your heart and take it to my father. I'm a Viking. I am a *Viking*!
Hiccup: I did this...
Astrid: Careful with that dragon.
Hiccup: It's... not the dragon I'm worried about.
Astrid: What are you gonna do?
Hiccup: Put an end to this. I have to try. Astrid, if something... goes wrong, just make sure they don't find Toothless.
Astrid: I will. Just... promise me it won't go wrong.
Gobber: Meet the Terrible Terror!
Tuffnut: Ha! It's like the size of my...
Tuffnut: OH, GET IT OFF!
Hiccup: Okay, but I hit a Night Fury.
Hiccup: Ahh, it's not like the last few times, Dad, I mean, I *really* actually hit it! You guys were busy and I had a very clear shot, it went down just off Raven Point. Let's get a search party out there before it...
Stoick: STOP! Just... stop. Everytime you step outside, disaster falls. Can you not see that I have bigger problems? Winter is almost here and I have an entire village to feed!
Hiccup: Eh, between you and me, the village could do with a little *less* feeding, don't you think?
Stoick: This isn't a joke, Hiccup! Agh, why can't you follow the simplest orders?
Hiccup: I - I can't stop myself! I see a dragon and I have to just... kill it, you know? It's who I am, Dad.
Stoick: Oh, you are many things, Hiccup. But a dragon killer is not one of them. Get back to the house.
Stoick: Make sure he gets there! I have his mess to clean up.
Tuffnut: Quite the performance.
Snotlout: I've never seen anyone mess up that badly. That *helped*!
Hiccup: Thank you, thank you, I was trying, so...
Hiccup: I knew it... I'm dead.
Stoick: No, but you gave it your best shot.
Stoick: When we crack this mountain open, all hell is going to break loose.
Gobber: And my undies. Good thing I brought extras.
Snotlout: So anyway, uh, I moved into my parents' basement? You should come by some time to work out. You look like you work out!
Gobber: Snotlout, you're done!
Hiccup: So I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Astrid: Nope, just you.
Hiccup: Oh, it's satisfying to know that all of our food has been dumped down a hole.
Stoick: Well, I can show my face in public again! If someone told me that in a few short weeks, Hiccup would go from, well, being, uh... *Hiccup*, to placing first in dragon training? Well, I would have tied him to a mast and shipped him off, for fear he'd gone mad!
Stoick: And you know it! But, here we are. And no one's more surprised... or more *proud*, than I am. Today, my boy becomes a Viking. Today, he becomes one of us!
Tuffnut: Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!
Fishlegs: Your mom let you get a tattoo?
Tuffnut: It's not a tattoo, it's a birth mark!
Ruffnut: Okay, I've been stuck with you since birth and that was never there before.
Tuffnut: Yes it was! You've just never seen me from the left side until now.
Gobber: Today is about teamwork! The Hideous Zippleback is extra tricky. One head *breathes* gas, the other head *lights* it. Your job, is to know which is which!
Fishlegs: Razor-sharp serrated teeth that inject venom for pre-digestion. Prefers ambush attack, crushing its victims...
Hiccup: Will you *please* stop that?
Stoick: I should have known. I should have seen the signs.
Hiccup: Dad...
Stoick: We had a deal!
Hiccup: I know, we did, but that was before I, I... agh, it's all so messed up...
Stoick: So everything in the ring... A trick? A lie!
Hiccup: I screwed up. I should have told you before now; just... take this out on *me*, be mad at *me*, but please... just don't hurt Toothless!
Stoick: The dragon? *That's* what you're worried about? Not the people you almost killed?
Hiccup: H-he was just protecting me! He's not dangerous!
Stoick: They've killed *hundreds* of us!
Hiccup: And we've killed *thousands* of them! They defend themselves, that's all! They raid us because they have to! If they don't bring enough food back, they'll be eaten themselves! There's, something *else* on their island, Dad, it... It's a dragon like...
Stoick: Their *island*! So you've been to the nest...
Hiccup: Did I say nest?
Stoick: How did you find it?
Hiccup: What, no, I, I didn't! Toothless did, only a dragon can find the island!
Hiccup: Oh no, Dad, no please, it's not what you think, you don't know what you're up against, it's like nothing you've ever seen!
Hiccup: Dad please, I promise you, you can't win this one! Dad, no!
Hiccup: For *once* in your *life*, would you please just *listen* to me?
Stoick: You've thrown your lot in with *them*. You're not a Viking... You're not my son.
Stoick: READY THE SHIPS!
Gobber: Welcome to Dragon Training!
Astrid: No turning back.
Tuffnut: I hope I get some serious burns!
Ruffnut: I'm hoping for some mauling, like, on my shoulder or lower back.
Astrid: Yeah, it's only fun if you get a scar out of it.
Hiccup: Yeah, no kidding, right? Pain. Love it.
Tuffnut: Oh great, who let *him* in?
Hiccup: So, later!
Gobber: Oh-oh, not so fast.
Hiccup: Uh, I'm kind of late for...
Astrid: What? Late for *what*, exactly?
Hiccup: Oh, that's Snotlout, Fishlegs, the twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut, and...
Hiccup: ...Astrid. Oh their job is so much cooler.
Viking: Get to the ships!
Stoick: No, no...!
Gobber: Smart, that one.
Stoick: I was a fool. Lead the men to the far side of the island!
Spitelout: Right!
Stoick: Gobber, go with the men!
Gobber: I think I'll stay, just in case you're thinking of doing something crazy.
Stoick: I can buy them a few minutes if I give that thing something to hunt!
Gobber: Then I can double that time.
Gobber: The Dragon Manual. Everything we know about every dragon we know of.
Gobber: No attacks tonight. Study up.
Tuffnut: Wait, you mean *read*?
Ruffnut: While we're still alive?
Snotlout: Why read words when you can just kill the stuff the words tell you stuff about?
Fishlegs: Oh! I've read it like, seven times. There's this water dragon that sprays boiling water at your face, and, and there's this other one, that buries itself for like a week...
Tuffnut: Yeah, that sounds great. There was a chance I was gonna read that...
Ruffnut: But, now...?
Hiccup: Ruff, Tuff, watch your backs! Move Fishlegs!
Tuffnut: Look at us! We're on a dragon. We're on a dragons! All of us.
Hiccup: Up! Let's move it.
Gobber: Every bit the boar-headed stubborn Viking you ever were!
Viking man: Night Fury! Get down!
Snotlout: I can't miss! What's wrong, buddy? Got somethin' in your eye?
Gobber: And with one twist, he took my hand and swallowed it whole. And I saw the look on his face. I was delicious! He must have passed the word, because it wasn't a month before another one of them took my leg!
Fishlegs: Isn't it weird to think that your hand was inside a dragon? Like if your mind was still in control of it, you could have killed that dragon from the inside, by... crushing its heart, or something.
Snotlout: I swear, I'm so angry right now! I'll avenge your beautiful hand and your beautiful foot. I'll chop off the legs of every dragon I fight... with my face!
Gobber: Uh-uh-uh, no. It's the wings and the tails you really want. If it can't fly, it can't get away. A *downed* dragon... is a dead dragon.
Fishlegs: Chances of survival are dwindling into single-digits now...
Gobber: Beard of Thor! What *is* that?
Stoick: Odin help us...
Gobber: The recruit who does best will win the honor of killing his first dragon in front of the entire village.
Snotlout: Hiccup already killed a Night Fury, so, does that disqualify him, or...?
Tuffnut: Can I transfer to the class with the cool Vikings?
Stoick: Here!
Gobber: Oh-ho-ho, no...
Gobber: Here!
Hiccup: Oh, and there's one more thing you need to know.
Hiccup: Sorry... Dad.
Astrid: Is this some kind of a joke to you? Our parents war is about to become ours.
Astrid: Figure which side your on.
Hiccup: Alright! Get Back! Now you've done it! Back,I say... Get back into your cage!
Hiccup: Think about what you've done.
Gobber: Don't worry. You're small and you're weak. That'll make you less of a target! They'll see you as sick or insane and go after the more viking-like teens instead.
