Ponyo: Ponyo wants ham!
Noriko: I'd let a fish lick me if it'd get me out of this wheelchair.
Lisa: So, Ponyo, what's your Dad like?
Ponyo: He hates humans! He keeps me in a bubble, so I swam away from home.
Ponyo: Ponyo loves Sosuke! I will be a human, too!
Lisa: I say we start with dessert and go backwards. It's been a backwards kind of day!
Sosuke: Mom! Ponyo came back, and she's a little girl now!
Sosuke: Look at her. Isn't she pretty?
Kumiko: That's the most boring goldfish I've ever seen in my entire life!
Fujimoto: Respect your father!
Ponyo: Ponyo loves Sosuke!
Lisa: So what's your Mother like, then?
Ponyo: She's big and beautiful, but she can be very scary!
Sosuke: Just like my Mom.
Kôichi: You can't be busy - you're five!
Sosuke: Ponyo, make the candle bigger!
Sosuke: That was weird.
