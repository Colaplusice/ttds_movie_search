Agrado: Well, as I was saying, it costs a lot to be authentic, ma'am. And one can't be stingy with these things because you are more authentic the more you resemble what you've dreamed of being.
Manuela: I'm not a whore. I've been fucked around a lot, but I'm not a whore.
Agrado: How could I own a real Chanel when there is so much poverty in the world?
Manuela: You are not a human being , , Lola. You are an epidemic.
Manuela: How could anyone act so macho with a pair of tits like that?
Agrado: Just don't disappear again. I like to say good-bye to the people I love, even if it's only to cry my eyes out, bitch.
Huma Rojo: There are people who think that children are made in a day. But it takes a long time, a very long time. That's why it's so awful to see your child's blood on the ground. A stream that flows for a minute yet costs us years. When I found my son, he was lying in the middle of the street. I soaked my hands in his blood and I licked them. Because it was mine. Animals lick their young, don't they? I'm not disgusted by my son. You don't know what it's like. In a monstrance of glass and topaz. I would put the earth soaked by his blood.
Agrado: I look like the Elephant Man!
Huma Rojo: But can you act?
Manuela: I can lie very well, and I'm used to improvising.
Manuela: Women will do anything to avoid being alone.
Sister María Rosa Sanz: Women are more tolerant, but that's good.
Manuela: Do you have any alcohol?
Agrado: No, I drank it all last night.
Manuela: I meant for disinfecting.
