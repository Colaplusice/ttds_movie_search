Bartolomeo: They are looking for someone who speaks German, to translate their instructions.
Guido: Me! I'll do it, I'll translate!
Bartolomeo: Do you speak German?
Guido: No.
Guido: Buon giorno, Principessa!
Guido: What are your political views?
Other Man: Benito, Adolf! Sit down! Sorry Guido, what did you say?
Guido: If you speak my name, I vanish. What am I? Silence.
Guido: The game starts now. You have to score one thousand points. If you do that, you take home a tank with a big gun. Each day we will announce the scores from that loudspeaker. The one who has the fewest points will have to wear a sign that says "Jackass" on his back. There are three ways to lose points. One, turning into a big crybaby. Two, telling us you want to see your mommy. Three, saying you're hungry and want something to eat.
Eliseo Orefice: You're serving. You're not a servant. Serving is a supreme art. God is the first servant. God serves men but he's not a servant to men.
Guido: You are such a good boy. You sleep now. Dream sweet dreams. Maybe we are both dreaming. Maybe this is all a dream, and in the morning, Mommy will wake us up with milk and cookies. Then, after we eat, I will make love to her two or three times. If I can.
Giosué Orefice: We won!
Dora: Yes, we won! It's true.
Giosué Orefice: We got a thousand points and we won the game! Daddy and me came in first and now we won the real tank! We won! We won!
Giosué Orefice: This is my story. This is the sacrifice my father made. This was his gift to me.
Giosué Orefice: I didn't like the train.
Guido: Me, neither. We'll take the bus back, okay?
Guido: Did you hear that? We're taking the bus back!
Giosué Orefice: "No Jews or dogs allowed".
Giosué Orefice: Why aren't Jews or dogs allowed to go in?
Guido: They just don't want Jews or dogs to go in. Everybody does what they want to, Joshua.
Guido: There's a hardware store there. They don't let Spanish people or horses into his store.
Guido: Further ahead, there's a drugstore. Yesterday, I was with a Chinese friend who had a kangaroo. I said, "May we?" "No, we don't want any Chinese or kangaroos here." They don't like them. What can I tell you?
Giosué Orefice: We let everybody into our bookshop.
Guido: No. From now on, we'll write it too. Is there anybody you don't like?
Giosué Orefice: Spiders. What about you?
Guido: I don't like Visigoths. Starting tomorrow we'll write: "No spiders and Visigoths allowed." I'm sick and tired of these Visigoths.
Guido: What kind of place is this? It's beautiful: Pigeons fly, women fall from the sky! I'm moving here!
Eliseo Orefice: Nothing is more necessary than the unnecessary.
Guido: I forgot to tell you.
Dora: Go ahead.
Guido: You can't imagine how much I feel like making love to you. But I'll never tell anyone, especially not you. They'd have to torture me to make me say it.
Dora: Say what?
Guido: That I want to make love to you - not just once, but over and over again! But I'll never tell you that. I'd have to be crazy to tell you. I'd even make love to you now... right here for the rest of my life.
Giosué Orefice: This is a simple story... but not an easy one to tell.
Giosué Orefice: Daddy, I cannot find any of the other kids, and a lady came telling me to take a shower.
Guido: That's a good idea. You go take a shower.
Giosué Orefice: No!
Guido: Go take a shower!
Giosué Orefice: No!
Dora: My husband and son are on that train. I want to get on that train. Did you hear me? I want to get on that train.
Giosué Orefice: When can I see Mama?
Guido: When the game's over.
Giosué Orefice: Where is Uncle going?
Guido: Uh... oh, he's playing on a different team. Goodbye, Uncle!
Giosué Orefice: Goodbye, Uncle.
Giosué Orefice: They make buttons and soap out of us.
Guido: Eh...
Guido: What are you saying?
Giosué Orefice: They burn us all in the oven.
Guido: Who told you that?
Giosué Orefice: A man was crying. He said they make us into buttons and soap.
Guido: You fell for that? Again? I thought you were a sharp boy... cunning, intelligent. Buttons and soap out of people? That'll be the day! You believed that? Hahaha! Just imagine. Tomorrow morning, I wash my hands with Bartolomeo... a good scrub. Then I'll button up with Francesco.
Guido: Darn it all!
Guido: Look, I just lost Giorgio! Does this look like a person? Hahaha, come on! They were teasing you! And you fell for it! What else did they tell you?
Giosué Orefice: That we get cooked in the oven.
Giosué Orefice: They burn us up in the oven.
Guido: You fell for that too! You just eat everything up! I've heard of a wood oven, but I've never seen a man oven before. Ah ha... "I'm made of wood!" "Take this lawyer... poomp!"
Guido: "This lawyer doesn't burn. He's not dry enough.
Guido: Look at that smoke!" Oh Joshua... buttons, soap, we get burned in the oven... Let's be serious now.
Guido: I have a sack race with the bad guys tomorrow...
Giosué Orefice: That's enough. I want to go home.
Giosué Orefice: Look, they stopped the train to let Mom get on.
Guido: Dora...
U.S. Tank Soldier: You have no idea what I'm saying, do you?
Guido: You've never ridden on a train, have you? They're fantastic! Everybody stands up, close together, and there are no seats!
Giosué Orefice: There aren't any seats?
Guido: Seats? On a train? It's obvious you've never ridden one before! No, everybody's packed in, standing up. Look at this line to get on! Hey, we've got tickets, save room for us!
Guido: You can lose all your points for any one of three things. One: If you cry. Two: If you ask to see your mother. Three: If you're hungry and ask for a snack! Forget it!
Guido: The prize is... the prize is...
Eliseo Orefice: A tank.
Guido: Yes! Yes, the prize is a tank.
Giosué Orefice: I already have one.
Guido: No, a real one.
Giosué Orefice: A real tank?
Guido: Dr. Lessing!
Dr. Lessing: Hello!
Dr. Lessing: What are the flowers for?
Guido: Ah... for your departure!
Dr. Lessing: Thank you!
Dora: At least they don't make the children and old people work.
Female Prisoner: They don't make them work because they kill them! One day, you will hear a lady calling, "Kids, come take a shower," then they gas them!
Dr. Lessing: Fat, fat, ugly, ugly, all yellow in reality. If you ask me what I am, I reply "Quark quark quark".
Dr. Lessing: Walking along, I go "Por-por". Who am I? Tell me true.
Guido: Dr. Lessing: Hmphh... a duckling, no?
Guido: Dr. Lessing: Is it not a duckling?
Dr. Lessing: It's not! A veterinarian friend of mine sent it to me from Vienna. I can't send him mine, until I solve this one. I thought: Duck-billed platypus. But it doesn't go "Quark quark quark quark". A duck-billed platypus goes...
Dr. Lessing: "Ffrrr ffrrr-ffrrr ffrrr-ffrrr". Duck-billed platypus...
Dr. Lessing: I translated it into Italian for you last night. Well, what do you say? Everything points to a duckling!
Dr. Lessing: Help me, Guido. For heaven's sake, help me. I can't even sleep.
Dr. Lessing: Fat, fat... ugly, ugly... that's me... quark quark quark... It's the duckling!
Guido: Giosué Orefice: Daddy, you scared me to death!
Dr. Lessing: I have something important to tell you. Wait for my signal.
