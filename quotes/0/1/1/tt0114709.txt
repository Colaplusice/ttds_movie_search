Woody: All right, that's enough! Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy.
Buzz: Toy?
Woody: T-O-Y, Toy!
Buzz: Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is "Space Ranger".
Woody: The word I'm searching for - I can't say, because there's preschool toys present.
Woody: What happened to you?
Buzz: One minute you're defending the whole galaxy, and, suddenly, you find yourself sucking down darjeeling with Marie Antoinette... and her little sister.
Woody: Reach for the sky!
Sid Phillips: Huh?
Woody: This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
Sid Phillips: What?
Woody: Somebody's poisoned the waterhole!
Sid Phillips: It's busted.
Woody: Who are you calling busted, Buster?
Sid Phillips: Huh?
Woody: That's right! I'm talking to you, Sid Philips! We don't like being blown up, Sid. Or smashed, or torn apart.
Sid Phillips: W-we?
Woody: That's right, your toys!
Woody: From now on, you must take good care of your toys, because if you don't, we'll find out, Sid!
Woody: We toys can see EVERYTHING!
Woody: So play nice!
Mr. Potato Head: Hey, Hamm. Look, I'm Picasso!
Hamm: I don't get it.
Mr. Potato Head: You uncultured swine! What're you lookin' at, ya hockey puck?
Buzz: And according to my navi-computer, the...
Woody: SHUT UP! Just shut up, you idiot!
Buzz: Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
Woody: This is a perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're gonna move from their house in two days, and it's all your fault!
Buzz: My-my fault? If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place...
Woody: Oh, yeah? Well, if *you* hadn't shown up with your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me...!
Buzz: Don't talk to me about importance! Because of *you*, the future of this entire universe is in jeopardy!
Woody: WHAT? What are you talkin' about?
Buzz: Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet! I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness. And *you*, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendezvous with Star Command!
Woody: YOU - ARE - A... *TOY*! You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear, you're... you're, you're an action figure!
Woody: *You* are a child's *plaything*!
Buzz: You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity.
Buzz: Farewell.
Woody: Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance, ya loony!
Woody: "Rendezvous with Star Command".
Sergeant: It's... it's bedsheets!
Mr. Potato Head: Who invited that kid?
Woody: Hey, who's got my hat?
Mr. Shark: Look, I'm Woody! Howdy, howdy, howdy!
Woody: Ha-ha, ha-ha...
Woody: Gimme that!
Mr. Potato Head: Hey, a laser! How come *you* don't have a laser, Woody?
Woody: It's not a laser! It's a...
Woody: It's a little light bulb that blinks.
Hamm: What's with him?
Mr. Potato Head: Laser envy.
Woody: Psst! Hey Buzz!
Woody: Hey! Get over here and see if you can get this toolbox off me!
Woody: Oh, come on Buzz. I can't do this without you. I need your help.
Buzz: I can't help. I can't help anyone.
Woody: Why sure you can, Buzz. You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Buzz: Andy's house. Sid's house. What's the difference?
Woody: Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly!
Buzz: No, Woody. For the first time, I *am* thinking clearly. You were right all along. I'm not a Space Ranger. I'm just a toy. A stupid, little, insignificant toy.
Woody: Wait a minute. Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Buzz: Yeah, right.
Woody: Not, it is!
Woody: Look, over there in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a toy. You are his toy!
Buzz: But why would Andy want me?
Woody: Why would Andy want you? Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear! Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you. You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that... that whoosh thing. You're a cool toy. As a matter of fact, you're too cool. I mean - what chance does a toy like me have against a Buzz Lightyear action figure. All I can do is this.
Woody: There's a snake in my boot!
Woody: Why would Andy ever wanna play me me, when he's got you? I'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket.
Woody: Hey, Buzz! You're flying!
Buzz: This isn't flying, this is falling with style!
Woody: To infinity and beyond!
Rex: Mr. Lightyear, now I'm curious... what does a space ranger actually do?
Woody: He's not a space ran-*ger*! He doesn't fight evil or, or... shoot lasers or fly.
Buzz: Excuse me.
Buzz: Hamm: Wow. Impressive wingspan. Very good.
Woody: Oh, what? What? These are plastic; he can't fly.
Buzz: They are a terillium-carbonic alloy, and I *can* fly.
Woody: No, you can't.
Buzz: Yes, I can.
Woody: Can't.
Buzz: Can.
Woody: Can't, can't, ca-an't!
Buzz: I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Woody: Okay, Mr. Light Beer, prove it.
Buzz: All right then, I will. Stand back, everyone.
Buzz: To infinity, and beyond!
Mr. Potato Head: Oh, really? I'm from Playskool.
Rex: And I'm from Mattel. Well, I'm not really from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout.
Buzz: What's going on?
Woody: Nothing that concerns you space man, just us toys.
Buzz: I'd better have a look anyway.
Buzz: Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
Woody: That's why. Sid.
Buzz: Sure is a hairy fella...
Woody: No, no, that's Scud, you idiot. *That* is Sid.
Buzz: You mean that happy child?
Mr. Potato Head: That ain't no happy child!
Rex: He tortures toys - just for fun!
Mr. Potato Head: Son of a building block!It's Woody!
Hamm: He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Bo Peep: Woody?
Woody: Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
Slinky Dog: I knew you'd come back!
Bo Peep: What are you doing over there?
Woody: It's a long story, I'll explain later. Here! Catch this!
Slinky Dog: I got it!
Woody: Good going Slink! Now tie it onto something!
Mr. Potato Head: Wait, I have a better idea! How about we don't?
Slinky Dog: Hey!
Bo Peep: Potato Head!
Mr. Potato Head: Did you all take those Stupid Pills this morning? Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?
Mr. Potato Head: And now you wanna let him back over here?
Woody: No, no. You got it all wrong Potato Head. Buzz is fine. Buzz is right here. He's with me.
Mr. Potato Head: You are a liar!
Woody: No i'm not!
Woody: Buzz, come over here and tell the nice toy's that you're not dead!
Woody: Just a sec.
Woody: Buzz, will you get up here and gimme a hand?
Woody: Ha-ha, ha-ha. That's real funny. THIS IS SERIOUS!
Andy: All right, everyone! This... is a stick-up. Don't anybody move! Now empty that safe!
Andy: Ooh, hoo hoo! Money, money, money!
Andy: Stop it! Stop it, you mean old potato!
Andy: Quiet, Bo Peep! Or your sheep get run over!
Andy: Help! Baaa! Help us!
Andy: Oh no! Not my sheep! Somebody do something!
Woody: Reach for the sky!
Andy: Oh no! Sheriff Woody!
Andy: I'm here to stop you, One-eyed Bart!
Andy: D'oh! How'd you know it was me?
Andy: Are you gonna come quietly?
Andy: Ya can't touch me, Sheriff! I brought my Attack Dog,
Andy: with a built-in force field!
Andy: Well, I brought my dinosaur!
Andy: Who eats force field dogs!
Andy: Arr rawr rawr! Yipe, yipe-yipe-yipe!
Andy: You're going to jail, Bart. Say goodbye to the wife and tater tots.
Andy: You saved the day again, Woody!
Woody: You're my favorite deputy!
Woody: Buzz! Oh, Buzz! Buzz Lightyear! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Buzz: Trouble? Where?
Woody: Down there. Just down there. A helpless toy! It's - It's trapped, Buzz!
Buzz: Then we've no time to lose.
Buzz: I don't see anything!
Woody: Uh, he's there. Just - Just keep looking.
Woody: Hamm, Mr. Potato Head: BUZZ!
Woody: Buzz!
Slinky Dog: I don't see him in the driveway. I think he bounced into Sid's Yard.
Woody: I think you've had enough tea for today. Let's get you out of here, Buzz...
Buzz: Don't ya get it?
Buzz: You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nes-bitt!
Woody: Snap out of it, Buzz!
Buzz: I-I-I'm, I'm sorry, I am just a little depressed, that's all. I can get through this.
Buzz: Oh, I'm a sham!
Buzz: I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Woody: Oh, great. If anyone attacks we can blink em' to death.
Mr. Potato Head: Mrs. Potato Head, Mrs. Potato Head, Mrs. Potato Head... hey, I can dream, can't I?
Buzz: This is an intergalactic emergency. I need to commandeer your vessel to Sector 12. Who's in charge here?
All Aliens: The clawwwwwwwww!
Alien #1: The claw is our master.
Alien #2: The claw chooses who will go and who will stay.
Woody: This is ludicrous.
Woody: Hey, Etch... Draw!
Woody: D'oh! Got me again! Etch, you've been working on that draw. Fastest knobs in the west.
Slinky Dog: Hey guys, RC's trying to tell us something.
Rex: What is it Boy?
R.C. the Race Car: Mr. Potato Head: He's saying that this is *no* accident!
Bo Peep: What do you mean?
Mr. Potato Head: I mean Humpty Dumpty was pushed, by Woody!
Woody: Wait a minute, You don't think I even meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you? Potato Head?
Mr. Potato Head: That's Mr. Potato Head to *you* you backstabbing murderer!
Woody: Now, guys, it was an accident. C'mon, you-you've gotta believe me.
Slinky Dog: We believe ya, Woody. Right, Rex?
Rex: Well, I mean, uh, I don't like confrontations!
Mr. Potato Head: Couldn't handle Buzz cutting on your playtime, could you Woody? Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz might be Andy's *new* favourite toy. So you got rid of him. Well what if Andy starts playing with *me* more Woody, huh? You gonna knock me out the window too?
Hamm: I don't think we should give him the chance.
Alien #1: A stranger.
Alien #2: From the outside.
Aliens: Oooooooooooooooh.
Buzz: Greetings, I am Buzz Lightyear. I come in peace.
Rex: Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
Hamm: Oh, for crying out loud, they're all in *boxes*, you idiot.
Rex: They're getting bigger...
Slinky Dog: Wait, there's a nice little one over there.
Rex, Hamm, Slinky Dog: AAAAAHH!
Woody: Buzz? Buzz Lightyear? You're not worried, are you?
Buzz: Me? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Are you?
Woody: Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?
Andy: Oh, oh, what is it? What is it? Wow, a puppy!
Woody, Buzz: Heh, heh!
Andy: Can I help pump the gas?
Andy's Mom: Suurrre, I'll even let you drive.
Andy: Really?
Andy's Mom: Yeah, when you're 16.
Andy: Yup, yup, yup, very funny, Mom.
Sid Phillips: "Extremely dangerous. Keep out of reach of children." Cool! What am I gonna blow? Hey where's that wimpy cowboy doll?
Sid Phillips: Yes, I've always wanted to send a spaceman into orbit.
Sid Phillips: Oh no!
Sid Phillips: Aww man!
Sid Phillips: Sid Phillips reporting. Launch of shuttle has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions at the Launch Site. Tomorrow's forecast: sunny, Ha, ha, ha! Sweet dreams!
Rex: What if Andy gets another dinosaur? A mean one? I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection!
Woody: How am I gonna convince those guys it was an accident?
Woody: Buzz!
Woody: Buzz! You're alive! This is great! I'm saved! Andy will find you here, he'll take us back to the room, and then you can tell everyone that this was all this all just a Big Mistake. Huh?
Woody: Right? Buddy?
Buzz: I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Woody: Oh. Well, that's good.
Buzz: But we're not on my planet, are we?
Woody: No. Daaaah-oof!
Woody: Okay, come on. You want a piece of me?
Woody: Ow!
Buzz: Buzz, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue.
Andy's Mom: Next stop...
Andy: Pizza Planet! Yeah!
Woody: Andy!
Woody: He doesn't realize I'm not there?
Woody: I'm lost! I'm a lost toy!
Buzz: Terrain seems a bit unstable. No readout yet if the air is breathable. And there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere...
Woody: Hello-o-o!
Buzz: HO-YAH!
Woody: Hey hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to. Sorry. Howdy. My name... is Woody... and this... is Andy's room. That's all I wanted to say. And also, there has been a bit of a mix-up. This is my spot, see... the bed here.
Buzz: Local law enforcement! It's about time you got here. I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit. My ship has crash-landed here by mistake.
Woody: Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed here is my spot.
Buzz: I need to repair my turbo boosters. Are you still using fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystallic fusion?
Woody: Well, let's see, we got double-A's.
Woody: Listen, Lightsnack. You stay away from Andy. He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
Buzz: What are you talking about? Where's that bonding strip?
Woody: And another thing, *stop* with this *spaceman* thing! It's getting on my nerves.
Buzz: Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command?
Woody: Oh-ho! O-okay, ooh, well, so you wanna do it the hard way, huh?
Buzz: Don't even think about it, cowboy.
Woody: Oh yeah, tough guy?
Buzz: The air isn't toxic?
Buzz: How dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet! My eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets!
Woody: You actually think you're THE Buzz Lightyear? Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!
Woody: Hey, guys, look! It's the *real* Buzz Lightyear!
Buzz: You're mocking me, aren't you?
Woody: Oh no, no no no, no...
Woody: BUZZ, LOOK, AN ALIEN!
Buzz: Where?
Woody: Hey! Who moved my doodle pad way over here?
Rex: ROAR!
Woody: Hey, how ya doin', Rex.
Rex: Were you scared? Tell me honestly.
Woody: I was close to being scared that time.
Rex: I'm going for fearsome here, but I just don't feel it! I'm think I'm just coming off as annoying.
Woody: Tuesday night's plastic corrosion awareness meeting, was I think, a big success. We'd like to thank Mr. Spell for putting that on for us. Thank you Mr. Spell.
Mr. Spell: You're. Welcome.
Mr. Potato Head: How did I get stuck with *you* as a moving buddy?
Rex: Everyone else was picked.
Buzz: Sheriff, I can see your indwelling from here. You're almost home.
Alien: Nirvana is coming, the mystic portal awaits.
Woody: Will you be quiet? You guys don't get it, do you? Once we go into Sid's house, we won't be coming out!
Alien: I have been chosen! Farewell, my friends. I go on to a better place.
Sid Phillips: Where are your rebel friends now?
Sid's Mom: Sid! Your Pop-Tarts are ready!
Sid Phillips: All right!
Woody: Al lright, all right! If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Rex: Yes, yes! We promise!
Woody: Okay! Save your batteries.
Sergeant: Molly's first present is... Mrs. Potato Head! Repeat, a Mrs. Potato Head!
Hamm: Way to go, Ida-ho!
Mr. Potato Head: Gee, I'd better shave!
Woody: Wind the frog!
Woody: Listen Buzz, forget about me. You should get outta here while you can.
Woody: Buzz! What are you doing? I thought you were...
Buzz: Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Buzz: Woody! It's the moving van!
Woody: We've gotta get out of here, now!
Woody: Buzz! Hey, I'm out!
Buzz: Almost there!
Buzz: Woody! Are you alright?
Woody: I'm fine... I'm OK.
Sid Phillips: Oh yeah! Time for lift off!
Buzz: I am Buzz Lightyear; I come in peace.
Rex: Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!
Woody: Pull my string! The birthday party's today? Okay everybody, the coast is clear!
Sergeant: There he is, men! Get him!
Mr. Potato Head: Let's string him up by his pull string!
Bo Peep: Would you boys stop it?
Andy: Okay, Mom, I'll be right down; I've gotta get Buzz.
Andy: Mom, do you know where Buzz is?
Andy's Mom: No, I haven't seen him.
Andy's Mom: Andy, I'm heading out the door!
Andy: But Mom, I can't find him!
Andy's Mom: Well honey, just grab some other toy; now, come on!
Andy: Okay.
Woody: AAAAAH! This is the part where we blow up!
Buzz: Not today.
Buzz: Years of Academy training wasted.
Sid Phillips: I wanna ride the pony...
Buzz: I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school!
Slinky Dog: Gaddily bob-howdy!
Woody: Oh, shut up.
Sergeant: It's a...
Rex: It's A WHAT? WHAT IS IIIITTTTT?
Rex: Oh, no!
Mr. Potato Head: Oh, you big lizard! Now we'll never know what it is!
Rex: Way to go, Rex!
Woody: No, no, turn 'em around! Turn 'em around!
Hamm: He's putting them in backward!
Hamm: Hey, you're putting 'em in backwards!
Woody: PLUS IS POSITIVE! MINUS IS NEGATIVE! Oh, let me!
Sergeant: Red alert! Red alert! Andy is coming upstairs!
Sergeant: ... juvenile intrusion, repeat! Assume your positions now!
Woody: ANDY'S COMING! Everybody back to your places! Hurry!
Mr. Potato Head: Where's my ear? Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Rex: Out of my way! Here I come, here I come!
Woody: Buzz! Go away, you disgusting freaks!
Woody: All back! Back, you cannibals!
Woody: He's still alive and you're not getting him, you monsters.
Woody: Hey, they fixed you? But... but they're cannibals, we saw them eat other toys.
Woody: Uh, sorry. We thought you're gonna... you know... eat my friend.
Woody: No, no, no, no, wait. What's wrong?
Sid's Mom: Sid?
Sid Phillips: Not right now, Mom. I'm busy!
Woody: Sid! Buzz, get up! Use our legs! Fine, let Sid trash but don't blame me!
Woody: Hey uh, Slinky?
Slinky Dog: Right here, Woody. I'm red this time.
Woody: No, Slink...
Slinky Dog: All right, you can be red if you want.
Woody: Not now, Slink. I've got some bad news.
Slinky Dog: Bad news?
Woody: Shhh!
Woody: Gather everyone for a staff meeting and be happy.
Slinky Dog: Got it.
Woody: Be happy!
Slinky Dog: Woody: Uh, Buzz, we missed the truck!
Buzz: We're not aiming for the truck!
Rex: Hey, Woody? Where'd you go?
Mr. Potato Head: He's lying, Buzz ain't there.
Woody: Oh, hi Buzz. Why don't you say hello to the guys over there?
Woody: Hiya fellas. To infinity and beyond!
Rex: Hey look, it's Buzz!
Woody: Yeah, hey, Buzz. Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake. Gimme five, man!
Hamm: Something's screwy here.
Woody: So, you see. We're friends now, guys. Aren't we, Buzz?
Woody: You bet, give me a hug.
Woody: Oh. I love you, too.
Slinky Dog: See? It is Buzz!
Slinky Dog: Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
Woody: It's a special spaceship, I just saw it.
Buzz: You mean it has hyperdrive?
Woody: Hyperactive hyperdrive, and astro... uh... turf.
Lenny the Binoculars: Guys! Guys! Woody's riding RC and Buzz is with him!
Bo Peep: It is Buzz! Woody was telling the truth!
Slinky Dog: What have we done?
Rex: Great, now I have guilt!
Announcer on Intercom at Pizza Planet: Before your space journey, re-energize yourself with a slice of pepperoni, now boarding at counter three.
Woody: Will Andy pick me?
Woody: 'Don't count on it'? Awwww! Arrrgh!
Sid Phillips: Hannah! Hey, Hannah!
Hannah: What?
Sid Phillips: Did I get my package in the mail?
Hannah: I don't know.
Sid Phillips: What do you mean, you don't know?
Hannah: I DON'T KNOW.
Minesweeper soldier: Just... just go on without me!
Sergeant: A good soldier never leaves a man behind!
Buzz: Can!
Rex: Whoooa! Oh wow, you flew magnificently!
Bo Peep: I've found my moving buddy!
Buzz: Thank... th-thank you all, thank you!
Woody: That wasn't flying! That was... falling with style!
Woody: Great!
Buzz: Woody! The rocket!
Woody: The match! Yes! Thank you, Sid!
Woody: No! No, no, no, no, noooooo!
Buzz: What are you doing?
Woody: Hold still Buzz!
Buzz: You did it! Next stop, Andy!
Woody: Wait a minute. I just lit a rocket. Rockets explode!
Sid Phillips: Oh no Hannah, look at Janey! She's sick!
Hannah: No she's not!
Sid Phillips: I'll have to perform one of my... operations!
Hannah: Sid, gave her back!
Hannah: Sid!
Sid Phillips: No-one has ever attempted a double bypass brain transplant before.
Sid Phillips: Doctor you've done it!
Sid Phillips: Hannah! Janey's all better now!
Hannah: Mum, Mum!
Sid Phillips: She's lying! Whatever she says is not true!
Mr. Potato Head: Ages three and up! It's on my box! Ages three and up! I'm not supposed to be babysitting Princess Drool!
Bo Peep: What would you say if I get someone else to watch the sheep for me tonight?
Woody: Oh-ho yeah. Thought so.
Buzz: Do you know these life forms?
Woody: Yes, they're Andy's toys.
Woody: Has everybody picked a moving buddy?
Hamm: Moving buddy? You can't be serious!
Rex: I didn't know we were supposed to have one already!
Mr. Potato Head: Do we have to hold hands?
Woody: "Rendezvous with Star Command."
Woody: Pizza Planet?
Woody: Andy! Oh, no! I can't show my face in that room without Buzz.
Woody: Buzz! Buzz, come back!
Buzz: Go away!
Woody: No! Buzz, you gotta come back! I...
Woody: I found a spaceship!
Woody: It's a spaceship, Buzz!
Buzz: Now, you're sure this space freighter will return to its point of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Woody: Uh-huh. And when we get there, we'll find a way to transport you home.
Buzz: Well, then, let's climb aboard.
Woody: No, no, no, wait, Buzz! Buzz! Let's get in the back. No one will see us there.
Buzz: Negative. There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area. We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
Woody: Yeah, bu... Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!
Woody: It's safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay. What an idiot.
Lenny the Binoculars: He's lighting it! He's lighting it!
Lenny the Binoculars: Hit the dirt!
Lenny the Binoculars: Look, look! It's Woody and Buzz, comin' up fast!
Sid Phillips: A Buzz Lightyear? No way.
Sid Phillips: Yes!
Sid Phillips: HEY!
All Aliens: He has been chosen.
Woody: Stop it! What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it, you zealots!
Sid Phillips: All right, Double Prizes!
Sid Phillips: Let's go home and play.
Sid Phillips: The Toys! The Toys are alive!
Sid Phillips: Nice Toy!
Hannah: What's wrong Sid? Don't you wanna play with Sally?
Andy: I couldn't find my Buzz. I know I left him right there.
Andy's Mom: Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Hamm: Yes, sir, we're next month's garage sale fodder for sure.
Woody: Sergeant, establish a recon post downstairs. Code Red. You know what to do.
Sergeant: Yes, sir!
Sergeant: All right, men, you heard him! Code Red, repeat: we're at Code Red! Recon plan Charlie: Execute! Let's move, move, move, move, move!
Slinky Dog: It's Sid!
Rex: I thought he was at summer camp!
Hamm: They must've kicked him out early this year.
Rex: Oh no, not Sid!
Mr. Potato Head: Wait just a minute. What are you trying to pull?
Woody: Nothing!
Hamm: That is disgusting!
Mr. Potato Head: *Murderer*
Woody: No, no no no! It's not what you think. I swear!
Mr. Potato Head: Save it for the jury!
Mr. Potato Head: I hope Sid pulls your voice box out, ya creep!
Woody: Don't leave! You've gotta help us please! You don't know what's it's like over here!
Woody: Slink, please! Please listen to me! Slink, don't...
Woody: SLI-I-I-I-NKYYY!
Buzz: What a spaceport!
Buzz: Good work, Woody.
Mr. Potato Head: Ah, ha. B-3.
Hamm: Miss. G-6.
Mr. Potato Head: Aw, you sunk it!
Mr. Potato Head: Are you peeking?
Hamm: Hey, quit your whining and pay up.
Hamm: No, no, not the ear. Gimme the nose.
Mr. Potato Head: How 'bout 3 out of 5?
Slinky Dog: It's too short. We need more monkeys!
Rex: There aren't any more! That's the whole barrel!
Rex: Buzz, the monkeys aren't working! We're formulating another plan, so stay calm!
Rex: Where could he be?
Hannah: Mom! Mom, have you seen my Sally doll?
Sid's Mom: What, dear? What was that?
Hannah: Never mind.
Andy: Hey, wow!
Andy's Mom: What? What is it?
Andy's Mom: Woody, Buzz!
Andy's Mom: Oh great, you found them; where were they?
Andy: Here in the car.
Andy's Mom: See? What did I tell you? Right where you left them.
Pizza Planet Guard: You are clear to enter. Welcome to Pizza Planet.
Woody: Oh, Bo, there's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Bo Peep: Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
Woody: Say, isn't that a mistletoe?
Bo Peep: Mm-hmm.
Sid Phillips: It's busted.
Woody: Who are you calling busted, buster?
Woody: That's right. I'm talking to you, Sid Phillips. We don't like being blown up, Sid. Or smashed. Or ripped apart.
Sid Phillips: W-we?
Woody: That's right. Your toys!
Woody: From now on, you must take good care of your toys! Because if you don't, we'll find out, Sid.
Woody: We toys can see everything.
Woody: So play nice.
Woody: Ha-ha! We did it, we did it! Yes!
