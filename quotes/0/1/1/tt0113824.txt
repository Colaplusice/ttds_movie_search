Seiji: Shizuku, I just wanted to let you know I really liked your lyrics. You're a really talented writer.
Shizuku: Just the other day you said they were corny.
Seiji: Oh, did I really say that?
Shizuku: Seiji!
Seiji: I'm sorry.
Shizuku: Ha! You're forgetful too. See you later!
Yasunari Tsukishima: Look at her, my little warrior.
Shizuku: Strange, its as if I have known you for a long time.
Shiho: Tidy up quickly and take that lunch box to Dad.
Shizuku: What?
Shiho: What do you mean by that tone? You're going to the library, right? Or shall I go instead? Then you can clean the toilet, the bathroom, and the entryway too, and go to the co-op for me. And take in the futons, do the shopping, and prepare dinner.
Shizuku: Goodbye!
Shizuku: What? You've read this!
Shizuku: Stupid jerk, stupid jerk, stupid jerk!
Shizuku: What? Not that jerk!
