Isadora: If you ever miss me, take a look at our little portrait. I say this because I fear that you'll forget me as well. I miss my father. I miss everything. Dora.
Dora's Client: My darling, My heart belongs to you. No matter what you've done, I still love you. I love you. While you're locked in there all those years, I'll be locked up out here, waiting for you.
Dora's Client: Dear Jesus, You're the worst thing to happen to me. I'm writing because your son Josue asked me to. I told him you're worthless, and yet, he still wants to meet you.
Dora's Client: I want to send a letter to a guy who cheated me. Mr Ze Amaro, Thank you for what you did to me. I trusted you and you cheated me. You even took the keys to my apartment.
