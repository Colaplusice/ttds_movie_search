Shaun: David, kill the Queen!
David: What?
Shaun: The jukebox!
Ed: 'Purple Rain'?
Shaun: No.
Ed: 'Sign o' the Times'?
Shaun: Definitely not.
Ed: The 'Batman' soundtrack?
Shaun: Throw it.
Ed: 'Dire Straits'?
Shaun: Throw it.
Ed: Ooh, 'Stone Roses'.
Shaun: Um, No.
Ed: 'Second Coming'.
Shaun: I like it!
Ed: Ahhh! 'Sade'.
Shaun: Yeah, but that's Liz's!
Ed: Yeah, but she did dump you.
Shaun: Oh!
Shaun: He's not my boyfriend!
Ed: It might be a bit warm, the cooler's off.
Shaun: Thanks, babe.
Shaun: As Mr. Sloan always says, there is no "I" in team, but there is an "I" in pie. And there's an "I" in meat pie. Anagram of meat is team... I don't know what he's talking about.
Shaun: As Bertrand Russell once said, "The only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation." I think we can all appreciate the relevance of that now.
Liz: Was that on a beer mat?
Shaun: Yeah, it was Guinness Extra Cold.
Liz: I won't say anything.
Shaun: Thanks.
Ed: What's the plan then?
Shaun: Right.
Shaun: We take Pete's car, we drive over to Mum's, we go in, take care of Philip - "I'm so sorry, Philip" - then we grab Mum, we go over to Liz's place, hole up, have a cup of tea and wait for this whole thing to blow over.
Ed: Why have we got to go to Liz's?
Shaun: Because we do.
Ed: But she dumped you!
Shaun: I have to know if she's all right!
Ed: Why?
Shaun: Because I love her!
Ed: All right... gayyy... I'm not staying there, though.
Shaun: Why not?
Ed: If we hole up, I wanna be somewhere familiar, I wanna know where the exits are, and I wanna be allowed to smoke.
Shaun: Okay.
Shaun: We take Pete's car, go round Mum's, go in, deal with Philip - "Sorry, Philip!" - grab Mum, go to Liz's, pick her up, bring her back here, have a cup of tea and wait for this whole thing to blow over.
Ed: Perfect!
Shaun: No, no, no, no, no, wait, we can't bring her back here.
Ed: Why not?
Shaun: Well, it's not really safe, is it?
Ed: Yeah, look at the state of it.
Shaun: Where's safe? Where's familiar?
Ed: Where can I smoke?
Shaun: Take car. Go to Mum's. Kill Phil - "Sorry." - grab Liz, go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for all of this to blow over. How's that for a slice of fried gold?
Ed: Yeah, boyyyeee!
Krishnan Guru-Murthy: Though no one official is prepared to comment, religious groups are calling it Judgement Day. There's...
Morrissey: ...Panic on the streets of London...
News Reporter: ...as an increasing number of reports of...
Football Commentator 2: ...serious attacks on...
News Reporter: ...people, who are literally being...
Documentary Narrator: ...eaten alive.
Jeremy Thompson: Witness reports at best are sketchy. One unifying detail seems to be that the attackers in many instances appear to be...
Vernon Kay: ...dead excited to have with us here a sensational chart topping...
Ed: Any zombies out there?
Shaun: Don't say that!
Ed: What?
Shaun: That!
Ed: What?
Shaun: The zed-word. Don't say it!
Ed: Why not?
Shaun: Because it's ridiculous!
Ed: All right... are there any out there, though?
Shaun: I can't see any. Maybe it's not as bad as all that.
Shaun: Oh, no, there they are.
Liz: Shaun?
Shaun: Yeah?
Liz: You see what I'm saying?
Shaun: Yep, totally.
Liz: I know he's your best friend, but you do live with him.
Shaun: I know.
Liz: It's not that I don't like Ed.
Liz: Ed, it's not that I don't like you.
Ed: It's all right.
Liz: It would just be nice if we could...
Ed: Fuck!
Liz: ...spend a bit more time together...
Ed: Bollocks!
Liz: ...just the two of us.
Ed: Cock it!
Liz: It's just with Ed here, it's no wonder I always bring my flat-mates out and then that only exacerbates things.
Shaun: What do you mean?
Liz: Well you guys hardly get on, do you?
Shaun: No, what does "exacerbate" mean?
Liz: It means um, to make things worse.
Shaun: Right. Well I mean, it's not that I don't like David and Di.
Shaun: Guys, it's not that I don't like you.
David, Dianne: It's all right.
Shaun: And it's not that I don't want to spend time with you cause I do. It's just... Ed doesn't have too many friends.
Ed: Can I get... any of you cunts... a drink?
Pete: It's four in the fucking morning!
Shaun: It's Saturday!
Pete: No, it's not. It's fucking Sunday. And I've got to go to fucking work in four fucking hours 'cos every other fucker in my fucking department is fucking ill! Now can you see why I'm SO FUCKING ANGRY?
Ed: Fuck, yeah!
Ed: Hey, Shaun, look who it is!
Shaun: Fuck-a-doodle-do!
Ed: We're coming to get you, Barbara!
Ed: What happened to your hand, man?
Pete: I got mugged on the way home.
Ed: By who?
Pete: I dunno by some crackheads or something, one of them bit me.
Ed: Why'd they bite you?
Pete: I don't know, I didn't stop to ask them! Now, I have a splitting headache, and your stupid hip hop isn't helping. And the front door is open... AGAIN!
Ed: It's not hip hop, it's Electro. Prick... Next time I see him, he's dead.
Shaun: Okay. But dogs CAN look up!
Ed: Do you want your messages?
Shaun: What?
Ed: Well, your mum rang about you going around tomorrow night, and then Liz rang about the two of you eating out tonight, and then your mum rang back to see if I wanted to eat her out tonight.
Shaun: *What*?
Various: You've got red on you.
Ed: What's up, niggas?
Shaun: Do you want anything from the shop?
Ed: Cornetto.
David: I'm not staying here.
Liz: David, don't, that's suicide.
Ed: I think you should go.
Ed: Who died and made you fucking king of the zombies?
Shaun: I've known him since primary school, you know? I like having him around, he's a laugh.
Pete: What, because he can impersonate an orangutan? Fuck-a-doodle-doo!
Shaun: Oh, leave him alone.
Pete: All right, I admit, he can pretty funny on occasion. Like that time we stayed up all night drinking apple Schnappes and playing Tekken 2.
Shaun: Oh yeah.
Shaun: When was that?
Pete: That was five years ago. When's he going home?
Shaun: Look, I don't care what the telly says, all right? We *have* to get out of here. If we don't they'll tear us to pieces, and that is really going to exacerbate things for all of us.
Shaun: Feel free to step in any time!
Ed: You did all right.
David: I didn't want to cramp your style.
Shaun: Are you all right?
Ed: Come on, let's just go.
Shaun: Hello?
Ed: He's going to be dead either way.
Shaun: Ed, that's not the point!
Shaun: Oh, thank God for that.
Dianne: Just look at the face: it's vacant, with a hint of sadness. Like a drunk who's lost a bet.
Liz: You hang out with my friends? Sorry, a failed actress and a twat?
Shaun: Well, that's a bit harsh.
Liz: Your words!
Shaun: I did NOT call Dianne a failed actress!
Barbara: Some men tried to get into the house.
Shaun: Well are they still there?
Barbara: I'm not sure, we've shut the curtains.
Shaun: Did you try the police?
Barbara: Well I thought about it.
Shaun: Are you OK? Did they hurt you?
Barbara: No I'm fine. I'm fine.
Shaun: Mum...
Barbara: Well they were a bit... bitey.
Shaun: Mum, have you been bitten?
Barbara: No... But Philip has.
Shaun: Oh, OK.
Ed: Has she been bitten?
Shaun: No, Philip has.
Ed: Oh, OK.
Shaun: Listen, Mum, what sort of state is he in?
Barbara: Oh, he's fine. Bit under the weather.
Shaun: I see.
Ed: What's the deal?
Shaun: We may have to kill my step-dad.
Ed: Don't forget to kill Philip!
Shaun: Well maybe one should do the other, and then do themselves.
Liz: Oh maybe you should do me, I'll only muck it up if I have to do myself.
Shaun: You know, I don't think I've got it in me to shoot my flatmate, my mum, and my girlfriend all in the same night.
Liz: What makes you think I'd have taken you back?
Shaun: Well... You don't want to die single do you?
Ed: That's it. I would like to be shot.
Shaun: Besides, I've changed. I haven't had a fag since yesterday, I promise!
Ed: He hasn't!
Ed: Why didn't you just shoot him, man?
Shaun: Ed, for the last time...
Ed: I fucking knew it!
Shaun: Pete? Pete?
Ed: Why don't we just go up?
Shaun: No. No. Wait. No. No! Don't go up there!
Ed: Why not?
Shaun: Because A, he might be one of them, and B, he might still be annoyed. Pete? Maybe he went into work.
Ed: Well, how come he didn't drive? His keys are still here.
Shaun: Well, maybe he got a lift; he said he wasn't feeling very well. Pete?
Ed: OI, PRICK!
Shaun, Ed: He's not in.
Yvonne: Shaun! How are you doing?
Shaun: Surviving.
Liz: Goodbye, Ed. Love you.
Ed: Cheers!
Shaun: I love you too, man.
Ed: Gaaayy!
Shaun: Oh, he sells a bit of weed every now and again, you know. You've sold puff.
Pete: Yeah. Once. At college. To you.
Videogame Voice: Player two has entered the game.
Shaun: Ed!
Ed: Ed: See? You don't need Liz to have a good time.
Shaun: Oh, don't, man.
Ed: No! Go ahead, look at me. Can I just say one more thing? I'm not gonna say, you know, there's plenty more fish in the sea. I'm not going to say if you love her, let her go. And I'm not going to bombard you with clichés. But what I will say is this?
Ed: It's not the end of the world.
Shaun: Mum, look, what would you say if I told you that over the years Philip's been quite unkind to me?
Barbara: Well you weren't always the easiest person to live with.
Shaun: Mum, he chased me around the garden with a bit of wood!
Barbara: Well you did call him a you-know-what!
Shaun: Oh what, did he tell you that?
Barbara: Yes he did.
Shaun: Motherfucker!
Barbara: Shaun!
Shaun: Sorry mother... mum!
Shaun: Did you know that on several occasions... he touched me?
Shaun: That wasn't true. Made it up. Shouldn't have done. Sorry.
Shaun: Got you these.
Liz: "To a wonderful mum"?
Shaun: Oooh! Yeah, that's, because... I thought, it would be, funny, because of what you said last night about me y'know, don't wanna be my mum and that. It's just a little joke, just sort of spur of the moment...
Liz: They're for your mum, aren't they?
Shaun: Yeah.
Liz: Smooth.
Jeremy Thompson - Newsreader: To recap, it is *vital* that you stay in your homes. Make no attempt to reach loved ones, and avoid all physical contact with the assailants.
Ed: Do you believe everything you hear on TV?
Shaun: Ohh, for God's sake! He's got an arm off!
Dianne: I don't think he'd leave us, Davs.
David: Wouldn't he? Lizzy, how can you put your faith in a man you spectacularly binned for being unreliable? A man whose idea of a romantic nightspot and an impenetrable fortress are the same thing? It's... This is a pub! We are in a pub! What are we going to do now?
Ed: We could get a round in.
Shaun: Philip, have you still got the child-locks on?
Philip: Safety first, Shaun.
David: You still haven't met his mum?
Shaun: Not yet!
Dianne: Don't you get on with your mum, Shaun?
Shaun: It's not that I don't get on with her...
David: Are you ashamed by your mum, Shaun?
Shaun: No! I love my mum!
Ed: I love his mum too.
Shaun: Ed!
Ed: She's like butter!
Shaun: Ed!
Liz: You left them in my flat.
Shaun: Yeah, in the bin!
Liz: I was desperate.
Shaun: Sneaky monkey...
David: Basically, I'd say your nine lives are up, Shaun
Shaun: Get fucked, four eyes! Why don't you go out with her if you love her so much?
David: What do you mean by that?
David: Well, I don't know what he meant by that.
Shaun: If you get cornered...
Shaun: ...bash 'em in the head, that seems to work. Ow.
Philip: You didn't call the doctor, did you?
Barbara: Well, I thought we ought to be on the safe side.
Philip: I'm quite all right, Barbara, I ran it under a cold tap.
Barbara: I really think...
Philip: We had our jabs when we went to the Isle of Wight.
Barbara: But Philip...
Philip: It's a lot of overblown nonsense, a lot of drug nuts running wild.

Ed: Two seconds!
Shaun: No, Noel, no matter you might think, okay, I do not find it difficult to keep my work and my social life separate.
Worker: Shaun, it's Liz for you.
Philip: You *do* realise this is a 20 mph zone?
Ed: Oh yeah!
Ed: There!

Dianne: Oh! Over there again. Quarter to twelve.
Shaun: What?
David: Eleven forty-five!
Shaun: Keep it simple!
Ed: Top left!
Ed: Who the hell put this on?
Shaun: It's on random.
Shaun: Come and get it! It's a running buffet!
Shaun: All you can eat!
Rabid Monkeys Newsreader: Claims that the virus was caused by rage-infected monkeys have now been dismissed as bull...
Shaun: Excuse me?
Shaun: Excuse me?
Shaun: Hellew?
Ed: Oi!
Shaun: Oh, my God! She's so drunk!
David: For a hero, you're quite a hypocrite!
Ed: Cock it!
Pete: Now, I'm not saying it was you.
Shaun: I know, man...
Pete: I'm saying it was Ed.
Shaun: Right.
Liz: Well... is it clear?
Shaun: No.
Liz: How many?
Shaun: Lots.
Shaun: You're the one that's gone from being a chartered accountant to Charlton Heston!
David: I'm not a chartered accountant!
Shaun: Well, you look like one!
Ed: YEAH!
David: I'm a lecturer.
Shaun: You're a twat!
Ed: YEAH!
Ed: I've got nothing.
Philip: You're not driving that car.
Trisha Goddard: You go to bed with it?
Shaun: Ed, this is serious!
Ed: Shaun, what's going on?
Shaun: Shit, it's engaged!
Ed: How about an ambulance?
Shaun: It's engaged, Ed.
Ed: A fire engine?
Shaun: It's one number, Ed, and it's busy! Okay? What you want a fire engine for, anyway?
Ed: Anything with flashing lights, you know?
Ed: You gonna thank me then?
Shaun: For what?
Ed: Tidying up!
Shaun: Doesn't look that tidy.
Ed: Well, I had a few beers when I finished.
Barbara: My, how you've grown!
Ed: Yeah, you'd better believe it.
Shaun: Would anyone like... a peanut?
Ed: Two seconds!
Ed: Oi! What are you doing?
Shaun: What am I doing? What are you doing, you stupid moron?
Ed: Fuck off!
Shaun: You fuck off! Fuck fucking off! I've spent... look at me! I've spent my entire life sticking my neck out for you and all you ever do is fuck things up! Fuck things up and make me look stupid! Well, I'm not going to let you do it any more. OK? Not today!
Liz: Shaun!
Shaun: What?
Shaun: Oh.
Ed: I'm sorry, Shaun.
Shaun: It's OK.
Ed: No, I'm *sorry*, Shaun.
Shaun: What?
Shaun: Oh, God, that's rotten!
Ed: I'll stop doing it when you stop laughing!
Shaun: I am not laughing!
Shaun: All right, what about her, then?
Ed: Ooooooh... cockacidal maniac. Ex-porn star. She's done it all. They say she starred in the world's first interracial hardcore loop...
Ed: Café au lait...
Ed: ... pour vous!
Shaun: Why is Queen still playing?
David: Ah, we have a situation here.
Shaun: I KNOW!
Shaun: Now, as well as, er, Mr. Sloane being off today, I'm afraid Ash is, er, feeling a little bit, erm, under the weather. So I will be taking charge as the, erm...
Noel: ...oldest...
Shaun: ...senior staff member.
Philip: You got red on you.
Dianne: SHAUN!
Shaun: NO!
Shaun: YES, yes, in the head!
Shaun: AHHHHHHHHH!
Shaun: They still out there?
Ed: Yeah. What you think we should do?
Shaun: Have a sit down?
Ed: Whoa, mama!
Shaun: Christ! What the hell do you think you're doing?
Ed: Chill out. Everyone's all right.
Shaun: Stop telling me to chill out!
Ed: Oh! Hello! Who's a pretty boy, then?
Ed: You didn't tell me Barbara had a Jag. I've always wanted to drive one of those.
Shaun: Yeah, well, it's Philip's, okay? He won't let anybody near it. Honestly, I put half a Mars bar in the glove box once and he chased me around the garden with a bit of wood.
Ed: Fuck. It's gorgeous.
Barbara: It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
David: What are we going to eat?
Dianne: Toasties!
Ed: There's a Breville out back.
David: Great. Saved by nibbles.
Dianne: Daffs is always taking me to see these listed buildings, and I'm always dragging him to the theatre.
Shaun: All right, I've got a car outside, but it's going to be a bit cramped, so has anyone got transport?
Dianne: Yes, yes!
Shaun: Great, where?
Dianne: Oh? No, well I passed my test.
Yvonne: Oh, my God! Shaun!
Shaun: He's not my Dad, he's my stepdad!
Ed: Big Al says so.
Shaun: Yeah, but Big Al says dogs can't look up!
Barbara: Hello Pickle! It's me, mum. Dad said he saw you in town today and mentioned that you might be visiting tomorrow, which would be lovely. Will you be bringing Elizabeth with you this time? Only we can't wait to meet her finally and also um... I was wondering if she wanted anything special for lunch. Cause these days a lot of people don't eat meat.
Shaun: Who the hell put this on?
Ed: It's on random.
Liz: For fuck's sake!
Liz: PLEASE CAN WE... JUST CALM... THE FUCK... DOWN!
Ed: There's a girl in the garden.
Shaun: What?
Ed: In the garden, there is a girl.
Shaun: Well, I mean, it's not that I don't like David and Di, you know.
Shaun: Guys, it's not that I don't like you.
Dianne: It's all right.
Shaun: And I do want to spend time with you.
Shaun: It's just Ed doesn't have too many friends...
Liz: You should do me. I'll muck it up if I have to do myself.
Shaun: I don't think I've got it in me to shoot my flatmate, my mum and my girlfriend all in the same evening!
Shaun: Hey! You're dead!
Shaun: I gotta do a wee first.
Shaun: This one comes with a basic sort of digital package, uh, you got your Lifestyle Channels there, a bit of "Trisha," um, you got "Entertainment" - don't know what that is. News. All the basic, uh, news channels.

Ed: Don't point that gun at Barbara!
