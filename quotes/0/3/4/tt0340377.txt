Finbar McBride: It's funny how people see me and treat me, since I'm really just a simple, boring person.
Joe Oramas: Hey listen, if you guys do something later, can I join you?
Finbar McBride: We're not gonna do something.
Joe Oramas: No, I know, but if you do, can I join you?
Finbar McBride: We're not gonna do something later.
Joe Oramas: Okay, but, if you do?
Finbar McBride: Okay.
Joe Oramas: Cool.
Joe Oramas: You the man.
Joe Oramas: You the man.
Finbar McBride: I'm retired, actually.
Emily: Aren't you a little young to be retired?
Finbar McBride: No, dwarves retire early. Common fact.
Emily: Yeah, *lazy* dwarves.
Joe Oramas: Hey, Olivia, you got a garlic press?
Olivia Harris: No.
Joe Oramas: How can you not have a garlic press?
Olivia Harris: Still no!
Joe Oramas: Alright, you keep talking! I'm gonna go cook without the garlic press!
Olivia Harris: I'm not used to having people in my house... especially loud people.
Finbar McBride: It's a nice house.
Olivia Harris: Yeah. David bought it as a get-away place... so I moved down here and got away.
Finbar McBride: Where did you used to live?
Olivia Harris: Princeton.
Olivia Harris: I know... I didn't get very far. But I just couldn't stay there another minute. Everyone looking at me... the poor woman whose son died.
Olivia Harris: How about you? What made you pick Newfoundland?
Finbar McBride: I wanted to live near Joe!
Joe Oramas: Guys!
Joe Oramas: Would you come up here and talk? Seriously, this sucks!
Joe Oramas: It's the librarian fantasy, man. Glasses off, hair down, books flying.
Finbar McBride: She doesn't wear glasses.
Olivia Harris: Well, buy her some, it's worth it.
Finbar McBride: Well, there are people called train chasers. They follow a train and they film it.
Olivia Harris: Are you a train chaser?
Finbar McBride: No.
Olivia Harris: How come?
Finbar McBride: I don't know how to drive a car. And I don't own a camera.
Olivia Harris: That'd do it.
Finbar McBride: You said you weren't going to talk to me if I sat here, Joe.
Joe Oramas: I haven't said anything in like twenty minutes.
Finbar McBride: Nine.
Joe Oramas: You timed me?
Finbar McBride: Mm-hmm.
Joe Oramas: That's cold, bro.
Joe Oramas: Hey, man, let me ask you a personal question. You've had sex before, right?
Finbar McBride: Yes.
Joe Oramas: With a regular sized chick?
Finbar McBride: With a regular sized chick.
Joe Oramas: Do they have clubs for you people?
Finbar McBride: What?
Joe Oramas: You know, for train watchers.
Joe Oramas: Trains are really cool.
Olivia Harris: They are.
Finbar McBride: So are horses.
Joe Oramas: What?
Finbar McBride: I was just thinking that.
Joe Oramas: Give me the joint, man.
Finbar McBride: Here I am! Take a look. TAKE A LOOK!
Emily: Your First name is Finbar?
Finbar McBride: Yes.
Emily: My name is Emily.
Finbar McBride: Hi.
Emily: Hi.
Emily: You have a nice chin.
Finbar McBride: Thanks.
Joe Oramas: A nice chin?
Finbar McBride: Yeah.
Joe Oramas: Seriously?
Finbar McBride: Yeah.
Joe Oramas: Fuckin' weird.
Olivia Harris: Would you do me a favor and not look at me right now?
Olivia Harris: When I was 19, I actually slept with a guy because he rolled his own cigarettes.
Henry Styles: Morning, professor.
Finbar McBride: Good morning.
