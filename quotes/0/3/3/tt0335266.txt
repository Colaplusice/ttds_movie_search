Charlotte: Let's never come here again because it would never be as much fun.
Charlotte: I just don't know what I'm supposed to be.
Bob: You'll figure that out. The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let things upset you.
Commercial Director: Mr. Bob-san, you are relaxing in your study. On the table is a bottle of Suntory whiskey. Got it? Look slowly, with feeling, at the camera, and say it gently - say it as if you were speaking to an old friend. Just like Bogie in Casablanca, "Here's looking at you, kid" - Suntory time.
Ms. Kawasaki: Umm. He want you to turn, looking at camera. OK?
Bob: That's all he said?
Ms. Kawasaki: Yes. Turn to camera.
Bob: All right. Does he want me to turn from the right, or turn from the left?
Ms. Kawasaki: Uh, umm. He's ready now. He just wants to know if he's supposed to turn from the left or turn from the right when the camera rolls. What should I tell him?
Commercial Director: What difference does it make! Makes no difference! Don't have time for that! Got it, Bob-san? Just psych yourself up, and quick! Look straight at the camera. At the camera. And slowly. With passion. Straight at the camera. And in your eyes there's... passion. Got it?
Ms. Kawasaki: Right side. And with intensity. OK?
Bob: Is that everything? It seemed like he said quite a bit more than that.
Commercial Director: Listen, listen. This isn't just about whiskey. Understand? Imagine you're talking to an old friend. Gently. The emotions bubble up from the bottom of your heart. And don't forget, psych yourself up!
Ms. Kawasaki: Like an old friend. And, into the camera.
Bob: OK.
Commercial Director: Got it? You *love* whiskey. It's *Suntory* time. OK?
Bob: OK.
Commercial Director: OK?
Bob: Commercial Director: OK!
Bob: I don't want to leave.
Charlotte: So don't. Stay here with me. We'll start a jazz band.
Bob: It gets a whole lot more complicated when you have kids.
Charlotte: It's scary.
Bob: The most terrifying day of your life is the day the first one is born.
Charlotte: Nobody ever tells you that.
Bob: Your life, as you know it... is gone. Never to return. But they learn how to walk, and they learn how to talk... and you want to be with them. And they turn out to be the most delightful people you will ever meet in your life.
Charlotte: That's nice.
Bob: For relaxing times, make it Suntory time.
Charlotte: I just feel so alone, even when I'm surrounded by other people.
Charlotte: 25 years. That's uh, well it's impressive.
Bob: Well you figure, you sleep one-third of your life, that knocks out eight years of marriage right there. So you're, y'know, down to 16 in change. You know you're just a teenager, at marriage, you can drive it but there's still the occasional accident.
Bob: Can you keep a secret? I'm trying to organize a prison break. I'm looking for, like, an accomplice. We have to first get out of this bar, then the hotel, then the city, and then the country. Are you in or you out?
Charlotte: I'm in. I'll go pack my stuff.
Bob: I hope that you've had enough to drink. It's going to take courage.
Bob: You want more mysterious? I'll just try and think, "Where the hell's the whiskey?"
Charlotte: I'm stuck. Does it get easier?
Bob: No. - Yes, it gets easier.
Charlotte: Oh yeah? Look at you.
Bob: Thanks.
Stills Photographer: You know double-O-7?
Bob: He drinks martinis, but all right.
Charlotte: I tried taking pictures, but they were so mediocre. I guess every girl goes through a photography phase. You know, horses... taking pictures of your feet.
Charlotte: That was the worst lunch.
Bob: So bad. What kind of restaurant makes you cook your own food?
Ms. Kawasaki: He want you to turn and look in camera. Okay?
Bob: Is that all he said?
Premium Fantasy woman: Mr. Kazu sent me, premium fantasy. My stockings. Rip them.
Premium Fantasy woman: Rip my stockings. Yes, please, rip them.
Bob: What?
Premium Fantasy woman: Rip them. HEY! Rip my stocking!
Bob: Hey? Lip them? Lip them? What?
Lydia Harris: Is this a bad time?
Bob: No, it's always a good time.
Lydia Harris: The burgundy carpet is out of stock: it's going to take twelve weeks. Did you like any of the other colors?
Bob: Whatever you like - I'm just completely lost.
Lydia Harris: It's just carpet.
Bob: That's not what I'm talking about.
Lydia Harris: What are you talking about?
Bob: I don't know. I just want to... get healthy. I would like to start taking better care of myself. I'd like to start eating healthier - I don't want all that pasta. I would like to start eating like Japanese food.
Lydia Harris: Well, why don't you just stay there and you can have it every day?
Bob: How are the kids doing?
Lydia Harris: They're fine. They miss their father.
Lydia Harris: Do I need to worry about you, Bob?
Bob: Only if you want to.
Bob: Enjoy your fright.
Bob: Enjoy my jacket, which you stole from me.
Charlotte: Did I scowl at you?
Bob: No, you smiled.
Charlotte: I did?
Bob: Yes, it was a complete accident. A freak. I haven't seen it since. Just that one time.
Bob: Like that, but bigger... bigger... mm-hmm... well, not that big!
Charlotte: So, what are you doing here?
Bob: Uh, a couple of things. Taking a break from my wife, forgetting my son's birthday. And, uh, getting paid two million dollars to endorse a whiskey when I could be doing a play somewhere.
Charlotte: Oh.
Bob: But the good news is, the whiskey works.
Bob: What are you doing?
Charlotte: My husband's a photographer, so he's here working. I wasn't doing anything so I came along.
Bob: What do you do?
Charlotte: I'm not sure yet, actually.
Bob: Help!
Charlotte: I'm in pain, I got my foot banged up. Wanna see it?
Bob: How do you say no?
Bob: Oh, my gosh! When did you do this?
Charlotte: I did it the other day, it hurts, y'know?
Bob: Didn't you feel any pain?
Charlotte: Yeah, it really hurt.
Bob: That toe is almost dead.
Bob: I think I got to take you to a doctor, you can't just put that back in the shoe. Well, you either go to a doctor or you leave it here.
Bob: He's smiling. You like that idea? See they love black toe in this country.
Charlotte: You're probably just having a mid-life crisis. Did you buy a Porsche yet?
John: Why do you have to point out how stupid everyone is all the time?
Charlotte: Why do they switch the r's and the l's here?
Bob: Uh... for yuks. You know? Just to mix it up.
Bob: They have to amuse themselves, 'cause we're not making them laugh.
Bob: I was feeling tight in the shoulders and neck, so I called down and had a Shiatsu massage in my room...
Charlotte: Mmh, that's nice!
Bob: And the tightness has completely disappeared and been replaced by unbelievable pain.
Kelly: But listen, let's all go out for a drink sometimes. Yeah?
John: Yeah, yeah.
Kelly: You know, call me, okay?
John: Yeah, okay.
Kelly: Alright. Listen, I'm under Evelyn Waugh. Shh, okay?
Charlotte: Evelyn Waugh? Evelyn Waugh was a man.
John: Oh, come on, she's nice. What? You know, not everybody went to Yale. It's just a pseudonym, for Christ's sake.
Kelly: Everybody is always, like, "Kelly, you are anorexic." And, I'm like, "No, I'm not." I eat all kinds... I eat so much junk food, you wouldn't believe it. I'd have a heart attack...
John: I thought you were anorexic...
Kelly: Everybody does...
John: Yeah, because you look so...
Kelly: Thank you. I know.
Premium Fantasy woman: You like massage?
Bob: I don't think I like massage anymore.
Charlotte: I went to this temple and all these monks were chanting and I didn't feel anything. John's been using these hair products and I don't know who I married anymore.
Bob: I don't get that close to the glass until I'm on the floor.
Stills Photographer: Are you drinking, no?
Bob: Am I drinking? As soon as I'm done.
Bob: You're not hopeless.
Bob: What did you study?
Charlotte: Philosophy.
Bob: There's a lot of money in that racket. You just have to work out all the angles.
DJ: I'd like to take that and lay it down with like a hip-hop beat like boom-tish boom-tish know what I mean?
Charlotte: No.
Bob: More than this, you know there's nothing. More than this, just tell me one thing.
Ms. Kawasaki: Welcome to Tokyo.
Bob: Thank you very much.
Ms. Kawasaki: My name is Kawasaki. Nice to meet you.
Bob: I've heard of you. Thank you.
Premium Fantasy woman: Oh Mr. Harris! Don't touch me! Mr. Bob Harris! Just rip my stocking!
Bob: Bye.
Charlotte: Bye.
Bob: Bye.
Bob: All right.
Kelly: John, John. You are my favorite photographer.
John: Ohhh...
Kelly: No. You are. I only want you to shoot me. It's true.
Kelly: Oh my God, I have the worst B.O. right now, I'm sorry.
Kelly: Wife?
Bob: Short and sweet? How very Japanese of you.
John: Do you have to smoke so much? It's just so bad for you.
Charlotte: I'll stop later.
Kelly: Okay, so are you going to join me for this power cleanse?
Charlotte: She's older. At least you'll have lots to talk about...
Bob: I can't believe you couldn't find anyone else to lavish you with attention.
Kelly: What's the religion, here, Christian?
DJ: Buddhism.
Kelly: And we both have two dogs, and we both live in L.A., so we have all these different things in common.
American Businessman #1: He's here with us? What's he doing here?
John: Well, not everyone went to Yale.
Charlotte: I thought it was funny.
Charlotte: Worst fight ever.
