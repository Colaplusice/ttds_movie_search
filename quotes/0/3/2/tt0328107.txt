Creasy: I'm gonna take your family apart piece by piece, you understand me? Piece by piece.
song lyrics: A word does not say anything, and at the same time it hides everything. Just as the wind that hides the water, like the flowers that mud hides. A glance does not say anything, and at the same time it says everything. Like rain on your face, or an old treasure map. A truth does not say anything, and at the same time it hides everything. Like a bonfire that does not go out, like a stone that is born dust. If one day you need me, I will be nothing. And at the same time I will be everything. Because in your eyes are my wings, and the shore where I drown. Because in your eyes are my wings, and the shore where I drown.
Samuel: Your resume is quite impressive. 16 years of miltary experience, extensive counter-terrorism work. I'm surprised anyone could afford you, what's the catch?
Creasy: I drink.
Samuel: How does that affect you?
Creasy: Coordination, reaction time. Top professionals try to kidnap your daughter I'll do the best I can but the service will be on par with the pay.
Samuel: What if amateurs try?
Creasy: I'd probably kill 'em. That likely?

Pita: You're late.
Creasy: I'm sorry.
Pita: Where's my mother?
Creasy: I dropped her at home.
Pita: It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
Pita: Do you think my mom likes you?
Creasy: I think she's afraid of me. But not the same way most people are.
Pita: I'm not afraid of you.
Creasy: I know you're not.
Pita: Are you afraid of me?
Creasy: I used to be. At first. But not any more.
Pita: Good.
Creasy: I got all the time in the world. *You* don't, but I do.
Rayburn: She showed him it was OK to live again.

Creasy: That's what you have in your ass right now. Don't move! Don't move!
Creasy: Did you say good bye to her? Say good bye now.
Rayburn: Georgina!... Obey me, and I will love you.
Creasy: So that's how it works huh?
Rayburn: That's how it works.
Creasy: Does she have a sister?
Creasy: I am going to ask questions. If you don't answer fully and truthfully, you will suffer much more than you have to. I'm going to cut your fingers off. One by one, if I have to.

Samuel: What are you talking about?
Lisa: Creasy, Pita likes him.

Creasy: The gunshot holds no fear, say it.
Pita: The gunshot holds no fear.
Creasy: You welcome the sound. In fact it's the sound that sets you free. You are a prisoner on this block until that sound sets you free.
Rayburn: And they're gonna wish they never touched a hair on her head.

Samuel: I have a policy. A.I.G. My dad gave it to me.
Jordan: Yeah, I know. I got it for your dad. But what are you gonna do in sixty days when you can't renew it? You can't, because you don't have a bodyguard.
