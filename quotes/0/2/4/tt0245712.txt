Susana: You and your plans. You know what my grandmother used to say? If you want to make God laugh... tell Him your plans.

Luis Miranda Solares: I don't know, "LostDog"?
El Chivo: You have a good imagination, you must be in advertisement!
El Chivo: Do you want something to drink? I've got rum, water and milk.
Luis Miranda Solares: What are you gonna do with me?
El Chivo: What does that mean? rum, water or milk?
Luis Miranda Solares: My question means what it means!
Ramiro: Did you find everything you needed?
Octavio: I am just missing some condoms. I didn't find my size.
Octavio: Being tough won't make you smart.
Luis Miranda Solares: Is this kidnapping or robbery?
El Chivo: It could be the last day of your life.
El Chivo: It's not right, asshole!
Ramiro: If you don't fuck off, I'll kick your fucking ass!
Octavio: I'm not scared of you.

Valeria: If you never come back it's okay too, bastard.
Octavio: If not now, then when?
Octavio: Come away with me.
El Chivo: You're hostile, sister-in-law.
