Dory: I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine and he shall be my Squishy. Come on, Squishy. Come on, little Squishy.
Dory: Ow. Bad Squishy, bad Squishy.
Dory: How about we play a game?
Marlin: All right.
Dory: Okay, I'm thinking of something orange, and it's small...
Marlin: It's me.
Dory: Right!
Dory: I'm thinking of something orange and small...
Marlin: Me again.
Dory: All right, Mr. Smartypants...
Dory: ... It's orange and small, and has stripes...
Marlin: Me, and the next one - just a guess - me.
Dory: Okay, that's just scary.
Dory: Just keep swimming.
Marlin: I promised I'd never let anything happen to him.
Dory: Hmm. That's a funny thing to promise.
Marlin: What?
Dory: Well, you can't never let anything happen to him. Then nothing would ever happen to him. Not much fun for little Harpo.
Crush: 'Cause we were like, "woaaaah.", and I was like, "woaaaah." and you were like, "woaaahh..."
Nemo: Has anyone seen my dad?
Peach: Honey, your father's probably back at the pet store.
Nemo: Pet store?
Bloat: Yeah. Like, I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.
Gurgle: Pet Palace.
Bubbles: Fish-O-Rama.
Deb: Mail Order.
Peach: Ebay.
Bruce: I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must first change myself. Fish are friends, not food.
Dory: No. No, you can't... STOP. Please don't go away. Please? No one's ever stuck with me for so long before. And if you leave... if you leave... I just, I remember things better with you. I do, look. P. Sherman, forty-two... forty-two... I remember it, I do. It's there, I know it is, because when I look at you, I can feel it. And-and I look at you, and I... and I'm home. Please... I don't want that to go away. I don't want to forget.
Marlin: I'm sorry, Dory. But I... do.
Bloat: Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Gill: We did it!
Bloat: Now what?
Seagulls: Mine.
Dory: Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills. When life gets you down do you know what you've gotta do?
Marlin: No, I don't know what to do.
Dory: Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming. Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming. What do we do? We swim, swim.
Marlin: Dory, no singing.
Dory: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ho. I love to swim. When you want to swim you want to swim.
Marlin: Now I'm stuck with that song... Now it's in my head.
Dory: Sorry.
Crush: Okay. Squirt here will now give you a rundown of proper exiting technique.
Squirt: Good afternoon. We're gonna have a great jump today. Okay, first crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall. There's a screaming bottom curve, so watch out. Remember: rip it, roll it, and punch it.
Marlin: It's like he's trying to speak to me, I know it.
Marlin: Look, you're really cute, but I can't understand what you're saying. Say the first thing again.
Marlin: Tell me, Dory, do you see anything?
Dory: Yeah, I see a light.
Marlin: A light?
Dory: Yeah. I see a light.
Marlin: Yeah, I see it too.
Dory: Hey, Conscience, am I dead?
Marlin: No, no. I see it, too.
Marlin: What is it?
Dory: It's so... *pretty*.
Marlin: I... I'm feeling... happy, which is a big deal... for me.
Dory: I want to touch it...
Dory: Oh!
Marlin: Hey, come back. Come on back here. I'm gonna get ya.
Dory: Come here.
Marlin: I'm gonna swim with you...
Dory: I'm gonna get ya. I'm gonna get ya.
Marlin: I'm gonna be your best friend...
Marlin: ...Good feeling's gone.
Marlin, Dory: AHH!
Marlin: THAAAANKKK YOUUUUU SIRRRRRRR.
Dory: Wow. I wish I could speak whale...
Crush: Oh, it's awesome, Jellyman. The little dudes are just eggs, we leave 'em on a beach to hatch, and then, coo-coo-cachoo, they find their way back to the big ol' blue.
Dory: Hi. I'm Dory.
Anchor, Chum, Bruce: Hello, Dory.
Dory: And, uh, well... well, I don't think I've ever eaten a fish.
Chum: Wow, that's incredible!
Bruce: Good on ya, mate!
Dory: Whew. Glad I got that off my chest.
Nemo: What's that?
Tad: I know what that is. Sandy Plankton saw one. He called it... uh... he said it was called a "butt".
Pearl: That's a pretty big butt.
Sheldon: Oh, look at me... I'm gonna touch the butt.
Bruce: Here's Brucey!
Sheldon: I'm H2O intolerant.
Crush: Dude? Dude? Focus dude... Dude?
Crush: Oh, he lives. Hey, dude!
Marlin: Oh... What happened?
Crush: Saw the whole thing, dude. First you were all like "whoa", and we were like "whoa", and you were like "whoa..."
Marlin: What are you talking about?
Crush: You, Mini-Man, takin' on the jellies. You've got serious thrill issues, dude. Awesome.
Marlin: Oh, my stomach. Ohh.
Crush: Oh, man. Hey, no hurling on the shell, dude, ok? Just waxed it.
Marlin: So, Mr. Turtle?
Crush: Whoa, Dude. Mister Turtle is my father. The name's Crush.
Marlin: Crush, really? OK, Crush. I need to get to the East Australian Current. EAC?
Crush: Oh, dude. You're ridin' it, dude! Check it out!
Marlin: What did it say? What did the mask say?
Dory: P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Dory: I remembered what it said! I usually forget things, but I remembered it that time! P. Sherman, 4...
Marlin: Wait! What does that mean?
Dory: I don't know. But who cares! Ha ha! I remembered! P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. I remembered it again!
Nemo: Hey dad! Maybe when I'm at school, I'll see a shark.
Marlin: I highly doubt it.
Nemo: Have how ever met a shark?
Marlin: No, and I don't plan to.
Nemo: How old are sea turtles?
Marlin: Sea turtles? I don't know.
Nemo: Sandy Plankton from next door, he says they live to be a hundred years old.
Marlin: Well, if I ever meet a sea turtle I'll ask him, right after I'm done talking to the shark.
Dory: Maybe he only speaks whale.
Dory: Mooo... Weeee neeeed...
Marlin: Dory?
Dory: ...tooo fiiind hiiis sooon.
Marlin: What are you doing? Are you sure you speak whale?
Dory: Caaaan yoooou giive uuuus direeeeectioooons?
Marlin: Dory! Heaven knows what you're saying! See, he's swimming away.
Dory: Cooome baaaaack.
Marlin: He's not coming back. You offended him.
Dory: Maybe a different dialect. Mmmmoooooowaaaaah...
Marlin: Dory! This is not whale. You're speaking like, upset stomach.
Dory: Maybe I should try humpback.
Marlin: No, don't try humpback.
Dory: Woooooo! Woooooo!
Marlin: Okay, now you really do sound sick.
Dory: Maybe louder. Rah! Rah!
Marlin: Don't do that!
Dory: Too much orca. Did it sound a little orca-ish to you?
Marlin: It doesn't sound orca. It sounds like nothing I've ever heard!
Seagulls: Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine.
Nigel: Oh would you just shut up? You're rats with wings!
Nemo: Are you all right?
Dory: I don't know where I am... I don't know what's going on. I think I lost somebody but I, I can't remember... and I can't remember...
Nemo: It's OK, it's OK. I'm looking for somebody too. Hey, we can look together.
Dory: I'm Dory.
Nemo: I'm Nemo.
Dory: Nemo?... that's a nice name...
Marlin: Dory there's no way out!
Dory: Hello?
Marlin: Dory, help me find a way out!
Dory: Sorry, can't help you, trying to escape!
Marlin: Dory, what are we going to do?
Dory: Hey look here, "es-ca-pe!" Its funny, it's spelled just like the word escape...
Anchor: He really doesn't mean it, you know! He never even knew his father!
Marlin: Where is it? Where is it?
Dory: Oh there's the menu, I knew it was around here somewhere.
Marlin: Well.
Marlin: Okay, you've got a lot of choices here. You can watch just the movie *without* the commentary...
Dory: Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! I'm so excited! I've always wanted to see... "The Little Mermaid"!
Marlin: Good. Well this is "Finding Nemo".
Dory: Oh, well that sounds nice, too. Maybe we should watch *that* one.
Marlin: We're watching that one! This is "Finding Nemo"!
Dory: Oh you shouldn't have switched just for me!
Marlin: Unbelievable...
Dory: I've always wanted to be in a film.
Marlin: You were in a film. THIS one. "Finding Nemo"!
Dory: No way! I'd remember that.
Dory: Seriously...
Marlin: No you wouldn't...
Dory: Yes I would.
Dory: Being in a film would be so glamorous!
Marlin: Really?
Dory: Oh my. Fabulous! Where's my trailer? I need water!
Marlin: Dory...
Dory: Fill my trailer with water!
Marlin: Something's wrong with you.
Dory: Just keep watching, just keep watching, just keep watching watching watching. Watching, watching, watching...
Marlin: You got a lot of choices here. Or you don't even have to watch *this* movie. Take the disc out, and I'll stop talking.
Marlin: There are no wrong choices. The only wrong choice is to sit there like you're doing.
Marlin: There are a lot of choices here, just pick one! Pick one so we can start! Please! All of us got nothing to do! Hit a choice, will ya?
Dory: Hoo hoo, hoo hoo! Keep on watching...
Squirt: Whoa! That was so cool! Hey, Dad! Did you see that? Did you see me? Did you see what I did?
Crush: You so totally rock, Squirt! So gimme some fin.
Crush: Noggin'.
Squirt, Crush: Dude!
Marlin: This is bad, Dory. Very bad.
Dory: Hey, watch this. Boing! Boing!...
Marlin: Dory!
Dory: You can't catch me!
Marlin: Dory, don't bounce on the tops! They will... not sting you. The tops don't sting you! That's it!
Dory: Two in a row. Beat that.
Marlin: Dory, listen to me. We're going to play a game.
Dory: A game?
Marlin: Yeah, a game.
Dory: I love games! Pick me!
Marlin: We're gonna race. First one out of the jellyfish wins.
Dory: Out, got it!
Marlin: Rules, rules! You can't touch the tentacles, only the tops...
Dory: Something about tentacles, got it.
Marlin: No, it's not something about them, it's all about them.
Dory: On your mark, get set, go!
Marlin: Wait, Dory!
Chum: Humans - -think they own *everything*.
Anchor: Probably *American*.
Dory: Have you seen a clown fish swim by? It looks just like him.
Nemo: But bigger.
Crab: Yeah, I saw him, Bluey. But I'm not telling you where he went, and there's no way you're gonna make me.
Seagulls: Mine?
Crab: Ahh! All right! I'll talk! I'll talk! He went to the fishing grounds! Aaah!
Seagulls: Mine? Mine. Mine!
Marlin: We did it, we did it oh, yeah, yeah, yeah! No eating here tonight, Woo!
Marlin, Dory: Eating here tonight!
Dory: No, no, no eating here tonight, you're on a diet!
Marlin: Crush, wait. How old are you?
Crush: Hundred and fifty, and still young, dude. Rock on.
Marlin: Wait a minute! You can read?
Dory: I can read? That's right, I can READ!
Marlin: Dory, do you see anything?
Dory: Ahh! Something's got me!
Marlin: That's just me. I'm sorry.
Dory: Who's that?
Marlin: Who's that? Who else would it be? It's me!
Dory: Are... are you my conscience?
Marlin: Yes, I'm your conscience. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you?
Dory: Eh, can't complain.
Marlin: Good. Now, Dory, do you see anything?
Dory: Yes, I see... a light. Hey, conscience, am I dead?
Marlin: No, I see it too.
Gill: My first escape. Landed on dentist tools. I was aiming for the toilet.
Nemo: The toilet?
Gill: All drains lead to the ocean, kid.
Nemo: Wow. How may times have you tried to get out?
Gill: Ah, I lost count.
Dory: I saw a boat.
Marlin: You did?
Dory: Yeah, it went by not too long ago. Follow me.
Dory: Would you quit it? What, the ocean isnt big enough for you or something like that? You got a problem? Huh? Do ya, do ya, do ya? You wanna piece of me? Yeah, yeah! Ooh, I'm scared now! What?
Marlin: What? You said you saw a boat.
Dory: A boat?
Marlin: YES.
Dory: Hey, I've seen a boat. It went by not too long ago. It went... this way. It went this way.
Marlin: Wait a minute, you already told me which way the boat went.
Dory: I did? Oh, no...
School of Fish: Oh and one more thing: when you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it.
Dory: Trench. Through it, not over. I'll remember.
Dory: Hey wait up there's something I gotta tell you.
Dory: Woah. Nice trench.
Nigel: Hi there. From my neck of the woods, eh? Sorry if I took a snap at you at one time. Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat.
Pearl: Hey. You guys made me ink.
Marlin: There was this mollusk, and he walks up to this sea cucumber. Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers, but in a joke everyone talks. So the sea mollusk says to the cucumber...
Marlin: Nemo!
Chum: Nemo! Ha ha! Nemo... I don't get it.
Bruce: For a clown fish, he's not that funny.
Bubbles: So, the Big Blue. What's it like?
Nemo: Umm... big... and blue?
Bubbles: I knew it.
Marlin: The water's going down. It's-it's-it's going down!
Dory: Hmm. Are you sure about that?
Marlin: Look! Already it's half-empty.
Dory: Hmm... I'd say it's half-full.
Marlin: Stop that! It's half-empty!
Gill: All drains lead to the ocean.
Bruce: Now there is a father looking for his little boy.
Bruce: I never knew my father!
Anchor: Come on, group hug.
Chum: We're all mates here, mate.
Bruce: Today's meeting is Step 5: Bring a fish friend. Everyone brought a fish friend?
Anchor: Got mine.
Dory: Hi there!
Bruce: What about you, Chum?
Chum: Oh... um... I seem to have misplaced my, um... friend.
Bruce: That's all right, mate. I had a feeling this would be a hard step. You can help yourself to one of my friends.
Chum: Thanks mate. A little chum for Chum, eh?
Marlin: I can't afford any more delays and you're one of those fish that causes delays. Sometimes it's a good thing. There's a whole group of fish . They're delay fish.
Dory: You mean...
Dory: . You mean you don't like me?
Marlin: No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't want to be with you. It's a complicated emotion.
Bob: Hey, you're doing pretty well for a first-timer.
Marlin: Well, you can't hold on to them forever, can you?
Bill: You know I had a tough time when my oldest went out to the drop off.
Marlin: They've just got to grow up som - THE DROP OFF? THEY'RE GOING TO THE DROP OFF? WHAT ARE YOU, INSANE? WHY DON'T WE JUST FRY THEM UP NOW AND SERVE THEM WITH CHIPS?
Bob: Hey Marty, calm down.
Marlin: Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy.
Bob: Pony boy?
Bill: You know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny.
Ted: Pity.
Gill: From this moment on, you shall now be known as Sharkbait.
Bloat, Gurgle, Bubbles: Sharkbait! Hoo ha ha!
Gill: Welcome, Brother Sharkbait!
Bloat, Gurgle, Bubbles: Sharkbait! Hoo ha ha!
Gill: Enough with the Sharkbait.
Gurgle: Sharkbait! Hoo... bop pa doo.
Marlin: ...and the sea cucumber turns to the mollusk and says, "With fronds like these, who needs anemones?"
Crush: Alright, we're here, dudes! Get ready! Your exit's comin' up, man!
Marlin: Where? I don't see it.
Dory: There! I see it! I see it!
Marlin: You mean the swirling vortex of terror?
Crush: That's it, dude!
Bruce: Hello. My name is Bruce.
Anchor, Chum: Hello, Bruce.
Bruce: It has been three weeks since my last fish, on my honor, or may I be chopped up and made into soup.
Chum: You're an inspiration to us all!
Anchor: Amen!
Dory: I suffer from short-term memory loss. It runs in my family... At least I think it does... hm. Where *are* they?
Deb: Kid, if there's anything you need, just ask your auntie Deb. That's me. Or if I'm not around, you can talk to my sister, Flo.
Deb: Hi, how are ya? Don't listen to anything my sister says, she's nuts!
Nigel: Reckon somebody oughta help the poor guy.
Pelicans: Yeah, yeah right...
Nigel: Well, don't everybody fly off at once.
Nigel: Okay, don't make any sudden moves. Hop inside my mouth... if you want to live.
Marlin: Hop in your mouth, huh? And how does that make me live?
Seagull: Mine?
Nigel: Because - I can take you to your son.
Marlin: Yeah, right.
Nigel: No, I know your son. He's orange and has a gimpy fin on one side.
Marlin: That's Nemo!
Marlin: If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny, and I know funny. I'm a clownfish!
Dory: Come on, let's go.
Marlin: No, no, no! Bad trench, bad trench! Come on, we're swimming over this thing.
Dory: Whoa, partner. Little red flag going up. Something tells me we should go through it, not over it.
Marlin: Are you even looking at this thing? It's got death written all over it!
Dory: I'm sorry, but I really, really, really think we should go through it.
Marlin: And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go.
Dory: Come on, trust me on this one.
Marlin: Trust you?
Dory: Yes, trust. It's what friends do.
Marlin: Look, something shiny!
Dory: Where?
Marlin: Oh, it just swam over the trench! Come on, we'll follow it. Let's go.
Dory: Okay.
Marlin: Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You're gonna get stuck out there and I'll have to go get you before another fish does. Get back here. Get back here now! Stop! You make one more move, mister...
Marlin: Don't you dare. If you put one fin on that boat - are you listening to me? Don't touch the...
Marlin: Nemo!
Tad: He touched the butt.
Crush: Oh. Intro- Jellyman, offspring. Offspring, Jellyman.
Dory: Okay, he either said, "move to the back of the throat," or he "wants a root beer float".
Crush: Okay, first, find an exit buddy.
Crush: Do you have your exit buddy?
Tad: I'm obnoxious!
Dory: Hey, what's wrong?
Marlin: What's wrong? While they're busy doing their little impressions, I'm miles from home with a fish who can't even remember her name.
Dory: Boy, I bet that's frustrating.
Marlin: Meanwhile, my son is missing.
Dory: Your son Chico?
Marlin: Nemo.
Dory: Right. Got it.
Marlin: But it doesn't matter, because no one in this entire ocean is going to help me.
Dory: Well, I'm helping you.
Dory: Si... side... syd... nay... Sydney!
Dory: Aah! Nemo!
Mr. Ray: Let's make a selection, a selection, a selection. Let's make a selection on the D-V-D! Ohhhhh! Pick something.
Nemo: Cool!
Mr. Ray: Welcome explorers! So much to see, so much to learn. Let's go!
Mr. Ray: Okay, optical orbits up front, and let's pick a button.
Dory: Uh! I'd like to see it with the commentary!
Marlin: It's not up to you.
Dory: Well, they might listen to me; I speak mammal. Choose the commentary!
Marlin: Unbelievable...
Mr. Ray: Sooo... Moving along!
Mr. Ray: All scientific exploration is an act of discovery, so pick a button and discover what happens.
Bruce: Hullo. My name is Bruce. I promise to watch all the making-of features, listen to the complete audio-visual commentary, and search diligently for Easter Eggs. On my honor, so help me.
Dory: Uhhh... the sea monkeys have my money... yes, I'm a natural blue...
Marlin: Now it's my turn. I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious. It's a fish we don't know. If we ask it directions, it could ingest us and spit out our bones.
Dory: What is it with men and asking for directions?
Marlin: I don't want to play the gender card right now. You want to play a card, let's play the "let's not die" card.
Marlin: So, we're cheating death now, that's what we're doing, and we're having fun at the same time, I can do this, just be careful...
Dory: Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win!
Marlin: Oh I don't think so!
Dory: Give it up old man, you can't fight evolution, I was built for speed!
Marlin: The question is Dory, are you hungry?
Dory: Hungry? Why?
Marlin: 'Cause you're about to eat my bubbles!
Marlin: What's going on?
Dory: I'll ask. Whaaaa...
Marlin: No, no more whale! You can't speak whale!
Dory: Yes I can!
Marlin: No, you can't! You think you can do these things, but you can't, Nemo!
Dory: I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine and he shall be my Squishy Come on, Squishy Come on, little Squishy...
Dory: Ow! Bad squishy, bad squishy!
Darla: Twinkle twinkle little star!
Peach: Find a happy place! Find a happy place! Find a happy place!
Squirt: Sweeeeet.
Crush: Totally.
Nemo: Are you all right?
Dory: I don't know where I am... I don't know what's going on. I think I lost somebody but I, I can't remember... and I can't remember...
Nemo: It's OK, it's OK. I'm looking for somebody too. Hey, We can look together.
Dory: I'm Dory.
Nemo: I'm Nemo.
Dory: Nemo?... that's a nice name...
Gill: You see that filter?
Nemo: Yeah.
Gill: You're the only one small enough to get in and out of that thing. All you have to do swim inside, jam a pebble in the fan, and swim out. Once you do that, this tank is going to get filthier and filthier, and the dentist will have no choice but to clean the tank himself. He'll put us in individual baggies, then we roll out the window, down to the ground, across the street, and into the ocean. It's foolproof!
Crab #1: Manna from heaven.
Crab #2: Sweet nectar of life.
Marlin: It's just as well. He might be hungry.
Dory: Oh don't worry. Whales don't eat clownfish. They eat krill.
Krill: Swim away.
Dory: Oh look, krill.
Pearl: See this tentacle? It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles, but you can't really tell, especially when I twirl them like this.
Patient: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!
Dentist: Oh... well, that's ONE way to pull a tooth...
Bloat: Uh-oh. Darla.
Nemo: What's wrong with her?
Gurgle: She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.
Bubbles: Poor Chuckles.
Deb: He was her present last year.
Bloat: Took a ride on the porcelain express.
Peach: She's a fish killer!
Peach: That's the shortest red light I've ever seen!
Crab#1: Hey.
Crab#2: Hey.
Crab#1: Hey.
Crab#2: Hey.
Darla: WHY... ARE... YOU... SLEEPING?
Crush: Mr. and Mrs. Jellyman. Ha ha! Awesome.
Crush: Whoa! Big ol' blue's one serious place, dude.
Crush: *That* is one totally tight crew! Awesome!
Crush: Dude! I don't know if I know what they know they are, but when I know, they'll know, you know?
Crush: News does travel swiftly, my man. Righteous!
Crush: Whoa. Jellyman and Little Blue inside the belly of the big one.
Crush: Dude, that is one gnarly little girl.
Crush: Little Blue is like "Whoa!", and Jellyman was like "Whoaaa!", but Little Jellyman was like "Whoa... my head."
Marlin: I have to get out of here! I have to find MY SON! I have to tell him... how!... old!... sea turtles are!
Mr. Ray: Okay, class. Optical orbits up front, and remember, we keep our subesophageal ganglion to ourselves. That means you, Jimmy.
Jimmy: Aw, man!
Gill: To the top of Mount Wanna-hock-a-loogie!
Marlin: I can't read human.
Dory: Then we need to find a fish that can read this. Hey, look! Sharks!
Bruce: Anchor! Chum!
Anchor: There you are, Bruce. Finally!
Bruce: We've got company.
Anchor: Well, it's about time, mate!
Chum: We've already gone through the snacks, and we're still starving!
Anchor: We almost had us a feeding frenzy.
Chum: Come on, let's get this over with.
Dory: Hey, careful with that hammer...
Mr. Ray: Well, hello Nemo. Who's this?
Nemo: Exchange student.
Squirt: I'm from the EAC, dude.
Mr. Ray: Sweet!
Nemo, Squirt: Totally!
Marlin: I have to get out of here! I have to find my son! I have to tell him how old sea turtles are!
Marlin: Hey. Guess what?
Nemo: What?
Marlin: Sea turtles? I met one, and he was a hundred and fifty years old.
Nemo: Hundred and fifty?
Marlin: Yup.
Nemo: Oh. 'Cause Sandy Plankton said that they only live to be a hundred.
Marlin: Sandy Plankton? You think I would travel the whole ocean and not know as much as Sandy Plankton? He was a hundred and fifty, not a hundred!
Dory: Hey, look, balloons. It is a party.
Bruce: Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dodgy. You wouldn't want one of them to pop.
Chum: Dolphins, yeah! They think they're so cute. "Oh, look at me, I'm a flippy little dolphin, let me flip for you. Ain't I something?"
Bruce: All right, anyone else? Hello, how 'bout you, mate? What's your problem?
Marlin: Me? I don't... I don't have a problem.
Bruce: Oh. Okay...
Bruce, Anchor, Chum: Denial.
Dory: Ow!
Marlin: Oh, I'm really sorry. Are you okay?
Dory: Ow, ow, ow!
Marlin: I'm so sorry.
Dory: You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding?
Marlin: Ohh!
Dory: Ow. Ow. Ow.
Bruce: Dory, are you okay...
Bruce: Oh, ooooooh, that's good...
Chum, Anchor: Intervention!
Squirt: Whoa! That was so cool! Hey dad! Did you see that? Did you see me? Did you see what I did?
Crush: You so totally rock, Squirt! So gimme some fin.
Crush: Noggin'.
Crush, Squirt: Dude!
Marlin: Oh, my goodness!
Crush: Whoa. Kill the motor, dude.
Dory: Well, let's just ask someone for directions.
Marlin: Who do you want to ask, the *speck*? There's no one here!
Bloat: Nemo, newcomer of orange and white, you have been called forth to the summit of Mt. Wannahockaloogie to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tankhood!
Nemo: Huh?
Peach: We want you in our club, kid.
Nemo: Really?
Bloat: If you are able to swim through... The Ring of Fire!
Bloat: Turn on the Ring of Fire. The Ring of Fire!
Jacques: Oops!
Bloat: You said you could do it.
Bloat: Ring of Fire!
Crush: RIGHTEOUS. RIGHTEOUS.
Marlin: I didn't come this far to be breakfast.
Gill: Who's with me?
Bloat: I.
Deb: I.
Bubbles: I.
Gurgle: I think you're nuts.
Bruce: Hello.
Dory: Well, hi!
Bruce: Name's Bruce.
Bruce: It's all right. I understand.
Bruce: Why trust a shark, right?
Gurgle: So, which one is it?
Nemo: I'm from the ocean.
Gurgle: Oh, the ocean. THE OCEAN? AAAH! He hasn't been decontaminated yet! Jacques!
Jacques: Oui.
Gurgle: Clean him!
Jacques: Oui.
Gurgle: Ocean!
Jacques: Oo, la mer! Bon!
Jacques: Voilà. He is clean.
Dentist: Good thing I pulled the right one, eh, Prime Minister?
Nemo: ...uh... AH.
Jacques: Suivez-moi.
Jacques: Follow me.
Mr. Ray: All new explorers must answer a science question. You live in what kind of home.
Nemo: An anemonemone. Amnemonemomne.
Mr. Ray: Okay, okay, don't hurt yourself, kid.
Fish in Tank: Sharkbait, HOO HA HA
Darla: I'm a piranha! They live in the Amazon!
Dentist: And a piranha is a fish, just like your present!
Gurgle: Ahh, no, no. Ah!
Bubbles: The bubbles, the bu?
Bubbles: Ugh!
Gurgle: Bloat, that's disgusting!
Bloat: Tastes pretty fine to me.
Gurgle: Doesn't anyone realize that we are swimming in our own...?
Peach: Shhh! Here he comes.
Bruce: Here's Brucieee!
Deb: What have we got?
Peach: Root canal, and by the looks of those X-rays, it's not going to be pretty.
Bloat: Rubber dam and clamp installed?
Peach: Yep.
Gurgle: What did he use to open?
Peach: A Gator-Glidden drill. He seems to be favoring that one lately.
Deb: I can't see, Flo.
Peach: Now he's doing the Schilder technique.
Bloat: Ooh, he's using a Hedstrom file.
Gurgle: That's not a Hedstrom file, it's a K-FLEX.
Bloat: It has a tear-dropped cross section. Clearly, a Hedstrom.
Gurgle: No, no, K-Flex.
Bloat: HEDSTROM.
Gurgle: K-FLEX!
Bloat: HEDSTROM!
Bloat: Oomp. There I go. A little help, over here.
Deb: I'll go deflate him.
Dory: Who is it?
Marlin: Dory, help me find a way out!
Dory: Sorry. Could you come back later? We're trying to escape.
Bruce: Just a bite!
Anchor: Now you hold it together, mate!
Chum: Remember, Bruce! Fish are friends, not food!
Bruce: Food!
Marlin: I'm dead. I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I died, I'm dead.
Marlin: You think you can do these things, but you just can't, Nemo.
Bruce: I'm having fish tonight.
Lobster: ...and it was like wicked dark down there. How's it going Bob?...
Dory: I saw a boat.
Marlin: Where? Which way?
Dory: It went... this way. It went this way. Follow me.
Dory: Would you quit it? What, the ocean isn't big enough for you or something like that? You got a problem? Huh? Do ya, do ya, do ya? You wanna piece of me? Yeah, yeah! Ooh, I'm scared now! What?
Marlin: Wait a minute...
Dory: Stop following me, okay?
Marlin: What are you talking about? You're showing which way the boat went.
Dory: A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went... this way. It went this way. Follow me.
Marlin: Wait a minute, wait a minute. What is going on? You already told me which way the boat was going.
Dory: I did? Oh, no...
Dory: This is the Ocean, silly, we're not the only two in here.
School of Fish: Hey, hey! You like impressions?
Dory: Mmm-hmm.
School of Fish: Okay, just like in rehearsal, gentlemen.
School of Fish: So, what are we? Take a guess.
Dory: Oh, oh, I've seen one of those.
School of Fish: I'm a fish with a nose like a *sword*.
Dory: Wait, wait, umm...
Marlin: It's a swordfish!
School of Fish: Hey, clown boy! Let the lady guess.
School of Fish: Where's the butter?
Dory: Ooh! It's on the tip of my tongue...
Marlin: Lobster!
School of Fish: Saw that.
Marlin: What?
School of Fish: Lots of legs, swims in the ocean.
Dory: Clam!
School of Fish: Close enough.
School of Fish: Oh, it's a whale of a tale, I'll tell you, lad...
Dory: Oh, they're good.
Gurgle: Oh, the human mouth is a disgusting place.
Nemo: I'm sorry I couldn't stop the...
Gill: No, I'm the one who should be sorry. I was so ready to get out, so ready to taste that ocean, I was willing to put you in harm's way to get there. Nothing should be worth that.
Gill: Nobody touch him! Nobody touch him.
Nemo: Can you help me?
Gill: No. You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out.
Deb: Ah, Gil...
Gill: I just want to see him do it, Okay? Keep calm. Alternate wriggling your fins and your tail.
Nemo: I can't. I have a bad fin.
Gill: Never stopped me.
Gill: Just think about what you have to do.
Gill: Perfect.
Gurgle: Whatever you do, don't mention D-A-R...
Nemo: It's all right. I know who you're talking about.
Marlin: Now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean?
Nemo: It's not safe.
Marlin: That's my boy.
Marlin: It's because I like you, I don't want to be with you. It's a complicated emotion.
Gill: All right, gang, we have less than 48 hours before Darla gets here. This tank will get plenty dirty in that time, but we have to help it along any way we can. Jacques.
Jacques: Oui.
Gill: No cleaning.
Jacques: I shall resist.
Gill: Everybody else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We're gonna make this tank so filthy the dentist will HAVE to clean it.
Gill: Good work.
Marlin: How do you know if they're ready?
Crush: Well, you never really know, but when they know, you know, y'know?
Marlin: I was right. You know what? We'll start school in a year or two.
Nemo: No, Dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean...
Marlin: Clearly, you're not ready, and you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do these things, but you just can't, Nemo!
Nemo: I hate you.
Bruce: So, what's a couple of bites like you doing out so late?
Marlin: Nothing, we're not doing anything, we're not even out.
Bruce: Great! Then how would you little morsels like to come to a little - a little get-together I'm having?
Dory: You mean like a party?
Bruce: Yeah, that's it, a party! What do you say?
Dory: Oh, I love parties! That sounds like fun.
Marlin: Parties are fun, and it's tempting, but we really have to...
Bruce: Aw, come on. I insist.
Marlin: Okay, that's all that matters.
Bubbles: Bubbles. Bubbles. My bubbles.
Marlin: The dropoff? They're going to the dropoff? What - what are you insane? Why not just fry them up now and serve them with chips?
Peach: Look, Scum angel.
Pelican 2: Nice.
Peach: Morning. It's morning, everyone! Today's the day! The sun is shining, the tank is clean, and we're about to get out of...
Peach: The tank is clean.
Peach: The tank is clean!
Marlin: What if they don't like me?
Coral: Marlin!
Marlin: No, really.
Coral: There's over 400 eggs, odds are, one of them is bound to like you.
Bloat: You must pass through... The ring of Fire.
Bloat: Turn on The Ring of Fire. The *Ring of Fire*. You said you could do it.
Jacques: Oops, sorry.
Dory: "P.Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney." I remembered it. I bet I could even remember it again..."P.Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney." I did it again.
Gurgle: Curse you, Aqua Scum.
Sheldon: He touched the butt!
Marlin: How do you know that nothing bad won't happen?
Dory: I don't.
Dory: DUCK.
Marlin: That's not a duck, it's a... PELICAN.
Dory: Excuse me? Whoo-hoo! Little fella? Hello! Don't be rude. Say hi.
Marlin: Ha. Hello.
Dory: His son Bingo...
Marlin: Nemo.
Dory: ...Nemo was taken to, um...
Marlin: Sydney
Dory: ...Sydney, yeah. And it's really, really important that we get there as fast as we can, so can you help us out? Come on, little fella. Come on.
Marlin: Dory? I'm a little fella. I don't think that's a little fella.
Gill: Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to them.
Nemo: Uh, Dad, you can let go now.
Marlin: How many stripes do I have?
Nemo: Dad, I'm fine...
Marlin: Answer the stripe question.
Nemo: *Three*.
Marlin: SEE? Something's wrong with you.
Marlin: I have one... two... three? That's all I have?
Marlin: Something's wrong with you, really.
Dory: Hey, look. "Esc-a-pay". I wonder what that means? That's funny, it's spelled just like the word "escape."
Marlin: He's my son, he was taken by these divers...
Dory: Oh my, you poor fish.
Chum: Humans - think they own *everything*.
Anchor: Probably *American*.
Marlin: Of course he wants us to move over there. That's EATING US.
Marlin: How do I taste, Moby, huh? DO I TASTE GOOD?
Coral: We still have to name them...
Marlin: You wanna name all of 'em, right now? All right.
Marlin: We'll name this half Marlin Jr.,
Marlin: And then this half Coral Jr. Okay, we're done.
Coral: I like Nemo.
Marlin: Nemo? Well, we'll name one Nemo, but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.
Nemo: Dad, you're not gonna freak out like you did at the petting zoo, are you?
Marlin: Hey, that snail was about to charge.
Marlin: I can't make out these markings.
Dory: Then we need to find a fish that can read this. Hey, look! Sharks!
Dory: Come on, trust me on this one.
Marlin: Trust you?
Dory: Yes, trust, it's what friends do.
Marlin: Wait, wait...
Marlin: Hold my fin, hold my fin!
Nigel: I can't go in there!
Marlin: Oh yes you can!
Gill: Look at that. Would you look at that? Filthy. Absolutely filthy. And it's all thanks to you, kid. You made it possible. Jacques! I told you not to clean!
Jacques: I am ashamed.
Marlin: Would somebody please just give me directions?
School of Fish: Would somebody please just give me directions?
Marlin: I'm serious!
School of Fish: Blah-blah-blah, me-me-blah! Blah-blah, blah-blah, me-me-me!
Marlin: Wow.
Coral: Mmm.
Marlin: Wow.
Coral: Mm-hmm.
Marlin: Wow.
Coral: Yes, Marlin. I... No, I see it. It's beautiful.
Marlin: So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view, you didn't think you were going to get the whole ocean, did you? Huh?
Marlin: Oh, yeah. A fish can breathe out here. Did your man deliver, or did he deliver?
Coral: My man delivered.
Marlin: And it wasn't so easy.
Coral: Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place.
Dory: P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney! You asked me where I'm going? OK, I'll tell you: P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney! That's where I'm going!
Nemo: Love you, Dad.
Marlin: The water is half empty!
Dory: Hmmm. I'd say it's half full.
Marlin: Where's Nemo? Where is he?
Bloat: Dentist! Dentist!
Marlin: What's a dentist? What is that?
Nigel: Alright Gerald, what is it? Fish got your tongue?
Dory, Marlin: Aaaaahh!
Nigel: Love a duck!
Nemo: First day of school! Wake up! Come on. First day of school.
Nemo: How many times have you tried to escape?
Gill: Eh, I lost count. Fish weren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to ya.
Bubbles: Bubbles, the bubbles, bubbles!
Mr. Ray: Well hello! Who is this?
Nemo: I'm Nemo.
Mr. Ray: Well, Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.
Nemo: Okay.
Mr. Ray: You live in what kind of home?
Nemo: In an an... an-nem-men-nem-mon-ee... A men-nem-men-nem-o-nee...
Mr. Ray: Okay, okay. Don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorer!
Marlin: I promise to never let anything happen to you, Nemo.
Dory: Es... Es-cap-e. Funny it's spelled just like the word escape.
Marlin: I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him.
Dory: Hm. That's a funny thing to promise.
Marlin: What?
Dory: Well, you can't let anything happen to him, then nothing would ever happen to him.
Dory: Just keep swimming, just keep swimming...
Dory: P Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.
Darla: Twinkle twinkle little star!
Peach: Find happy place, find happy place!
Marlin: Ah ah ah! Forgot to brush.
Nemo: Ughhhhhh.
Marlin: Do you want this anemone to sting you?
Nemo: ...yes!
Marlin: Brush.
