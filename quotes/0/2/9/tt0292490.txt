Siddharth Sinha: Take this sand for instance, the tighter you try to hold it, the more it slips out of our hand.
Akash Malhotra: Dad, there is more to life than just signing checks.
Akash's father: Really... What is that?
Akash Malhotra: I don't know, but as soon as I do, you will be the first to know.
Akash Malhotra: So where are you going?
Shalini: ...This flight goes to Sydney
Akash Malhotra: I know, but where are *you* going?
Shalini: To Sydney!
Akash Malhotra: What a coincidence, the three of us are going to Sydney!
Shalini: Three of us?
Akash Malhotra: You, me, and this flight.
Pooja: Are they your friends?
Sameer: Yeah.
Sameer: That's Sid, and this is Akash.
Pooja: Seems to be a very deep friendship!
Sameer: Yeah, either the friendship is deep... or the photo is 3d.
Sameer: Sorry... bad joke.
Tara Jaiswal: The two of you must be like, "where did Siddharth bring us"
Sameer: No, nothing like that. For cake, we'd go anywhere.
