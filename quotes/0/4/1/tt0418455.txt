Dr. Kolberg: Adam, this makes no sense at all. I am a man of science, I believe in numbers and charts. Goddamnit, I wanna go someplace, where people die when they are sick, and don't sit in the yard eating cowboy toast when they have been shot through the head.
Adam Pedersen: What the hell are you doing?
Khalid: I got stressed! You saw him, yourself! He came at me with his knee! His sociopathic knee!
Jørgen: You shot me!
Khalid: Yeah, there's alot of witnesses! It's not the first time he does it!
Jørgen: You shot me!
Khalid: I said I'm sorry, you fat bastard! Now, shut the fuck up! What do you wanna do? Argue about it?
Ivan: So, what do you want to do?
Adam Pedersen: I wanna bake an apple pie.
Ivan: Okay, you'll bake an apple pie! That's your task.
Khalid: God damnit, this is a shitty day!
Khalid: God damnit! It was all fresh!
Esben: What the hell are you doing?
Adam Pedersen: Picking apples.
Esben: With a sand-nigger?
Holger: What happened?
Adam Pedersen: It was a lightning. It knocked down the tree.
Esben: What the hell is wrong with you? Are you trying to make us look bad?
Jørgen: What do you mean?
Esben: You're running around talking about apple pie and climbing trees with a nigger. Are you an idiot?
Adam Pedersen: Listen, Esben. I think you should get out of here.
Esben: What did you say?
Khalid: He said that you should fuck off and take your fat friend with you!
