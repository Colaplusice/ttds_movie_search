Woody: So long... partner.
Andy: Now Woody, he's been my pal for as long as I can remember. He's brave, like a cowboy should be. And kind, and smart. But the thing that makes Woody special, is he'll never give up on you... ever. He'll be there for you, no matter what.
Barbie: Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not from threat of force!
Andy: This is Jessie, the roughest, toughest cowgirl in the whole west. She loves critters, but none more than her best pal, Bullseye!
Andy: Yee-haw!
Andy: Here.
Bonnie: Andy: This is Rex! The meanest, most terrifying dinosaur who ever lived! RAWR! RAWR!
Bonnie: Andy: The Potato Heads: Mr. and Mrs. You gotta keep them together because they're madly in love.
Andy: Now Slinky here, is as loyal as any dog you could want.
Andy: And Hamm, he'll keep your money safe, but he's also one of the most dastardly villains of all time: Evil Dr. Porkchop!
Andy: These little dudes are from a strange alien world: Pizza Planet!
Andy: And this, is Buzz Lightyear, the coolest toy ever! Look! He can fly, oh, and shoot lasers!
Andy: He's sworn to protect the galaxy from the Evil Emperor Zurg!
Bonnie: Buzz Lightyear: To Infinity, and Beyond!
Andy: Now, you gotta promise to take good care of these guys. They, mean, alot to me.
Woody: You'll be okay in the attic?
Jessie: Of course I will... Besides, I know about Buzz's Spanish Mode.
Buzz Lightyear: My what?
Spanish Buzz: Bitácora Espacial - Me he despertado de hiper-sueño en un planeta extraño.
Hamm the Piggy Bank: Now what did you do?
Rex the Green Dinosaur: I just did what you told me!
Spanish Buzz: Estoy rodeado por criaturas extrañas y desconozco sus intenciónes. ¿¡Quién anda ahí? ¿Amigo? O enemigo?
Spanish Buzz: Woody: Uh... Amigos! We're all amigos!
Spanish Buzz: Me debo haber estrellado, y se me borró la memoria.
Spanish Buzz: Spanish Buzz: ¿Han visto a mi nave espacial?
Woody: We gotta switch him back.
Slinky Dog: Well how do we do that?
Hamm the Piggy Bank: I don't know, that part's in Spanish!
Woody: Oh... we don't have time for this. Come on, El Buzzo!
Spanish Buzz: Mi nave espacial? Encontraste? Exelente!
Jessie: Buzz! We're your friends!
Buzz Lightyear: Spare me your lies, temptress! Your emperor's defeated, and I'm immune to your bewitching good looks.
Woody: Hello?
Chatter Telephone: You shouldn't have come back cowboy. They've cracked down hard since you left. More guards, more patrols, you and your friends ain't ever getting out of here now.
Woody: I made it out once.
Chatter Telephone: You got LUCKY once. Want my advice? Keep your heads down, you'll survive.
Woody: Yeah, for how long?
Chatter Telephone: I've been here years, they'll never break me. There's only one way toys leave this place.
Chatter Telephone: Poor fella. Trash truck comes at dawn, then it's off to the dump.
Woody: Look, I appreciate your concern old-timer, but we have a kid waiting for us. Now, we're leaving. If you'd help us, one toy to another, I'd sure be grateful.
Chatter Telephone: Well... if you're gonna get out, first things you're gonna get through is the doors. Locked every night, inside and out, keys are left on a hook in the office.
Woody: Got it. What else?
Chatter Telephone: Lotso has trucks patrolling all night long. Hallway, lobby, playground...
Woody: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but what about the wall?
Chatter Telephone: Eight feet high; cinder block; No way through it. You go over, or under.
Woody: That's it? It doesn't seem so bad.
Chatter Telephone: It's not. Your REAL problem's the monkey. The Monkey's the eye in the sky. He sees everything... classrooms, hallways, even the playground. You can unlock doors, sneak past guards, climb the wall, but if you don't take out that monkey you ain't going nowhere. You want to get out of here... GET RID OF THAT MONKEY!
Woody: Look, I just need to get out of here...
Buttercup: There is no way out!
Buttercup: Just kidding. Door's right over there.
Spanish Buzz: ¡Venga conmigo, señorita! ¡Te mostraré las maravillas de la galaxia, y juntos lucharemos contra el despiadado Zurg!
Jessie: Woody! Thank goodness!
Woody: C'mon! We're almost there!
Spanish Buzz: ¡El Vaquero!
Jessie: No!
Buzz Lightyear: Glad I could catch the train!
Woody: Now let's catch some criminals!
Buzz Lightyear: To infinity and beyond!
Aliens: Ooh!
Woody: Reach for the sky!
Mr. Potato Head: You can't touch me, Sheriff. I brought my attack dog with a built-in force field!
Woody: Well, I brought my dinosaur who eats force field dogs!
Jessie: Yodel-ay-hee-hoo!
Rex the Green Dinosaur: Huh?
Buzz Lightyear: Evil Dr. Porkchop!
Hamm the Piggy Bank: That's *Mr.* Evil Dr. Porkchop to you.
Young Andy: Buzz, shoot your laser at my badge!
Young Andy: Woody, no! It'll kill you!
Young Andy: Just do it!
Chuckles: Yeah, I knew Lotso. He was a good toy. A friend. Me and him, we had the same kid: Daisy. I was there when Lotso got unwrapped. Daisy loved us all. But Lotso... Lotso was special. They did everything together. Never seen a kid and toy more in love. One day we took a drive, hit a rest stop, had a little playtime. After lunch, Daisy fell asleep. She never came back. Lotso wouldn't give up. It took forever, but we finally made it back to Daisy's. But by then, it was too late. Something changed that day inside Lotso. Something snapped.
Lotso: She replaced us. Come on.
Chuckles: No, she only replaced you.
Lotso: She replaced all of us, didn't she?
Lotso: She don't love you no more.
Lotso: Now, come on.
Chuckles: We were lost, cast-off, unloved, unwanted. Then we found Sunnyside. But Lotso wasn't my friend anymore. He wasn't anyone's friend. He took over Sunnyside and rigged the whole system.
Woody: So, how'd you get out?
Chuckles: I got broke. Bonnie found me, took me home. Other toys... they weren't so lucky. It ain't right what Lotso done. New toys... they don't stand a chance.
Mrs. Potato Head: Poor Barbie!
Hamm the Piggy Bank: I get the Corvette.
Lotso: I didn't throw you out. Your kid did. Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really. Chew on that when you're at the dump.
Woody: Wait. What about Daisy?
Lotso: I don't know what you're talking about.
Woody: Daisy? You used to do everything with her?
Lotso: Yeah, then she threw us out.
Woody: No, she lost you.
Lotso: She *replaced* us!
Woody: She replaced *you*, and if you couldn't have her, then no one could! You lied to Big Baby and you've been lying ever since!
Lotso: Where'd you get that?
Woody: She loved you, Lotso.
Lotso: She never *loved* me!
Woody: As much as any kid ever loved a toy.
Big Baby: Mama.
Lotso: What? You want your mommy back? She never loved *you*! Don't be such a BABY!
Lotso: Push 'em in! All of them!
Lotso: This is what happens when you dummies try to think! WE'RE ALL JUST TRASH WAITIN' TO BE THROWN AWAY! THAT'S ALL A TOY IS!
Lotso: Hey, stop it! Put me down, you idiot!
Lotso: AAAAH! No! No, wait a minute, Big Baby! Wait!
Aliens: The Claw!
Mr. Potato Head: Ah, ha ha ha! Money, money, money!
Woody: You've got a date with justice, One-Eyed Bart!
Mr. Potato Head: Too bad, Sheriff! I'm a married man!
Woody: One-Eyed Betty?
Jessie: I think you dropped something, mister!
Mr. Potato Head: Jessie?
Woody: Give it up, Bart! You've reached the end of the line!
Mr. Potato Head: I always wanted to go out with a bang!
Jessie: Oh, no!
Woody: The orphans!
Mr. Potato Head: Hate to leave early, but our ride is here!
Aliens: Ooh!
Mr. Potato Head: It's me or the kiddies, Sheriff! Take your pick!
Woody: Ride like the wind, Bullseye!
Buzz Lightyear: That wasn't me, was it?
Jessie: Buzz, you're back!
Buzz Lightyear: Uh, yes, yes I am. Where did I go?
Woody: Beyond infinity, Space Ranger.
Woody: Oh no.
Hamm the Piggy Bank: Oh yes! Return of the Astro-Nut!
Buzz Lightyear: Hold on, this is no time to be hysterical!
Hamm the Piggy Bank: This is the perfect time to be hysterical.
Rex the Green Dinosaur: Should we be HYSTERICAL?
Slinky Dog: No!
Mr. Potato Head: Yes!
Buzz Lightyear: Maybe! But not right now!
Hamm the Piggy Bank: C'mon. Let's go see how much we're going for on eBay.
Lotso: Ken? New toys!
Ken: Far out! Down in a jiff, Lotso.
Ken: So, who's ready for Ken's dream tour?
Lotso: Let's show our new friends where they'll be staying!
Ken: Uh, folks, if you'll just want to step right this way...
Ken: Hi, I'm Ken.
Barbie: Barbie. Have we ever met?
Ken: I would have remembered.
Ken: Love your leg wamers!
Barbie: Nice ascot!
Lotso: Come on, Ken, recess don't last forever.
Ken: Right on, Lotso. This way everybody.
Lotso: Got a lot to look forward to, folks. The little ones love new toys.
Buzz Lightyear: What a nice bear!
Rex the Green Dinosaur: And he smells like strawberries.
Woody: Ugh.
Lotso: Where's your kid now, Sheriff?
Rex the Green Dinosaur: Mr. Lotso, do toys here get played with every day?
Lotso: All day long! Five days a week.
Jessie: But what happens when the kids grow up?
Lotso: Well now, I'll tell you.
Lotso: When the kids get old, new ones come in. When they get old, new ones replace them. You'll never be outgrown, or neglected. Never abandoned or forgotten. No owners means - no heartbreak!
Jessie: Yee-haw!
Mrs. Potato Head: It's a miracle!
Mr. Potato Head: And you wanted us to stay at Andy's!
Woody: Because we're Andy's toys!
Lotso: So you got donated by this "Andy", huh? Well it's his loss, Sheriff. He can't hurt you no more.
Woody: Whoa! Whoa, whoa whoa...
Lotso: Now let's get you settled in.
Mr. Potato Head: It was cold and dark, nothing but sand and a couple of Lincoln Logs.
Hamm the Piggy Bank: Eh... I don't think those were Lincoln Logs.
Buzz Lightyear: Prisoners sleep in their cells. Any prisoner caught outside their cells spends the night in the box. Roll call at dusk and dawn. Any prisoner misses roll call spends the night in the box. Prisoners do NOT speak unless spoken to. Any prisoner talks back spends the night...
Jessie: In the BOX. We GET it.
Lotso: At ease Soldier!
Hamm the Piggy Bank: Hey, where's that fur-ball Lotso?
Slinky Dog: Yeah, I'd like to loosen his stitching.
Woody: Forget it, guys. He's not worth it.
Chunk: He ain't the sharpest knife in the... place where... they keep the knives...
Sparks: Neither are you, Chunk!
Chuckles: We were lost, cast-off, unloved, unwanted. Then we found Sunnyside. But Lotso wasn't my friend anymore. He wasn't anyone's friend. He took over Sunnyside and rigged the whole system.
Woody: So, how'd you get out?
Chuckles: I got broke. Bonnie found me, took me home. Other toys... they weren't so lucky. It ain't right what Lotso done. New toys... they don't stand a chance.
Sergeant: We've done our duty. Andy's grown up.
Army Man 1: Let's face it. When the trash bags come out, we army guys are the first to go.
Buzz Lightyear: Trash bags?
Woody: Who said anything about trash bags?
Sergeant: It has been an honor serving with you. Good luck, folks.
Army Man 2: You're gonna need it!
Woody: There's a snake in my boot!
Woody: I'd like to join your posse, boys, but first I'm gonna sing a little song.
Bonnie: A sheriff!
Bonnie: Move over, Mr. Pricklepants!
Bonnie: We have a guest!
Bonnie: You want some coffee?
Bonnie: It's good for you, but don't drink too much or you'll have to - Be right back!
Woody: Pssst! Hey! Hello! Hi. Excuse me...
Mr. Pricklepants: Shh!
Woody: Can you tell me where I am?
Mr. Pricklepants: Shhh!
Buttercup: The guy's just asking a question.
Mr. Pricklepants: Well, excuse me! I am trying to stay in character!
Buttercup: My name's Buttercup.
Mr. Pricklepants: Shh!
Trixie: Hello! I'm Trixie!
Mr. Pricklepants: Shhh!
Trixie: Shhh!
Woody: Guys, hey! Guys, look, I don't know where I am...
Trixie: We're either in a café in Paris or a coffee shop in New Jersey. I'm pretty sure I just came back from the doctor with life-changing news.
Buttercup: We do a lot of improv here. Just stay loose, have fun - you'll be fine!
Woody: No, no no no, I...
Molly: Uh!
Andy: You need a hand?
Molly: I got it!
Andy: Here.
Andy: So, you gonna miss me when I'm gone?
Molly: If I say no, do I still get your room?
Andy: Nope.
Molly: Then, yes, I'll miss you.
Ken: And this... well, this is where I live. It's got a disco, it's got a dune buggy, and a whole room just for trying on clothes.
Barbie: You have everything!
Ken: Everything... except someone to share it with...
Barbie: Chunk: Heh, heh heh heh... You think they had a fun playtime?
Twitch: Shh! They might hear you!
Ken: Okay, now you start.
Barbie: I...
Ken: love...
Barbie: you! Oh!
Ken: See? That time I said "love"! Okay, now me first.
Barbie: Ooh! Okay okay okay...
Ken: I...
Barbie: love...
Ken: you! You see what I mean? It changes every time!
Barbie: You are so smart!
Twitch: C'mon, Romeo. We're late.
Mr. Potato Head: I told you kids to stay out of my butt!
Andy: Thanks, guys.
Mr. Potato Head: You would not believe what I have been through tonight!
Woody: We're all still here! I - I mean, yeah, we've lost friends along the way... Wheezy... and Etch...
Rex the Green Dinosaur: And Bo Peep?
Woody: ...Yeah. Even - even Bo.
Jessie: Woody, we were wrong to leave Andy. I - I was wrong...
Mr. Potato Head: Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong.
Mrs. Potato Head: You saved our lives!
Mr. Potato Head: And *we* are eternally grateful!
Mr. Potato Head: My boys!
Aliens: Daaaaaady!
Rex the Green Dinosaur: He held me! He actually held me!
Buttercup: My name's Buttercup. You've met Baron von Shush.
Jessie: Buzz! Mind if I squeeze in next to you?
Buzz Lightyear: Yes. No! I mean, w-w-why-why would I mind squee-squeezing next to you? - Is it hot in here?
Frog: Hey buddy, you might wanna keep your mouth shut.
Jessie: Buzz! What do we do?
Buzz Lightyear: I, uh, I have no idea what came over me.
Jessie: Just go with it, Buzz.
Mr. Potato Head: Remember all that bad stuff I said about Andy's attic? I take it all back.
Slinky Dog: Ya darn-tootin'
Hamm the Piggy Bank: You said it!
Ken: No one appreciates clothes here, Barbie! No one.
Buzz Lightyear: That Barbie has nice handwriting!
Jessie: Uhh, Buzz? Barbie didn't write this.
Rex the Green Dinosaur: At last! I'm gonna get played with!
Woody: Hey, if any of you get to Sunnyside Daycare, you tell 'em Woody made it home.
Dolly: You came from Sunnyside?
Trixie: But how'd you escape?
Woody: Well, it wasn't easy. I... What do you mean "escape"?
Mr. Pricklepants: Sunnyside is a place of ruin and despair, ruled by an evil bear who smells of strawberries.
Woody: Wh...? Lotso?
Buttercup: The guy may seem plush and huggable on the outside, but inside, he's a monster!
Woody: But, how'd you know that?
Mr. Pricklepants: Chuckles... he'll tell you.
Woody: You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in the attic. It'll be safe and warm...
Buzz Lightyear: And we'll all be together.
Woody: Exactly! There's games up there and books and...
Buzz Lightyear: The race car track!
Woody: The race car track. Thank you!
Slinky Dog: And the old TV.
Woody: There you go, the old TV. And those guys from the Christmas decorations box. They're fun, right?
Andy's Mom: Andy's Mom: Andy's going to college. Can you believe it?
Andy: Mom, I'm not leaving 'til Friday.
Andy's Mom: What are you going to do with these old toys?
Woody: Who's "Velocistar237"...?
Trixie: Oh! That's just a dinosaur toy down the street, that's nothing, let just take care of that.
Trixie: It's just a dinosaur!
Woody: All right...
Jessie: I should have seen this coming! It's Emily all over again!
Jessie: Hogtie the mailman! We gotta get you home before Andy leaves tomorrow!
Lotso: F.A.O. my Schwartz!
Bookworm: All right, Ken. Here you go
Bookworm: But I don't know why it couldn't have waited until tomorrow.
Bookworm: Huh?
Bookworm: Sheesh!
Barbie: Let's see... Hawaiian surf trunks!
Ken: Barbie, those were vintage! It's okay! Go ahead, rip 'em! They're a dime a dozen!
Barbie: Ooh! Glitter tux!
Ken: Who cares? Who cares? Sequins are tacky!
Barbie: A Nehru jacket!
Ken: Barbie! Not the Nehru!
Barbie: This is from, what? 1967?
Ken: The Groovy Formal Collection, yes!
Barbie: What a shame.
Ken: Oh, no! No! No, no, no! There's an instruction manual!
Ken: Lotso switched Buzz to Demo Mode!
Barbie: Where's that manual?
Lotso: You've got a playdate with destiny!
Buzz Lightyear: We're going in the attic now, folks. Keep your accessories with you at all times. Spare parts, batteries, anything you need for an orderly transition.
Andy's Mom: Look, it's simple. Skateboard? College! Little League trophy? Probably attic. Apple core? Trash.
Woody: Day care is a sad lonely old place for toys who don't have a home.
Barbie: ...WAAAAGH!
Hamm the Piggy Bank: Quite the charmer, ain'tya?
Buzz Lightyear: Quiet, musical hog!
Mrs. Potato Head: Darling, are you okay?
Mr. Potato Head: I feel fresh, healthy, It's terrible.
Mrs. Potato Head: You've lost weight, and so tall.
Slinky Dog: I thought we were going to the attic?
Mr. Potato Head: But these toddlers... they don't know how to play with us!
Rex the Green Dinosaur: They're too young!
Lotso: Welcome to Sunnyside, folks. I'm Lots-o-Huggin Bear. But please, call me Lotso.
Dolly: Wow, cowboy. You just jump right in, don't you? I'm Dolly.
Woody: Woody.
Dolly: Woody? You're gonna stick with that? Well, now's the time to change it, you know, new room and all. That's coming from a doll named Dolly.
Andy: Molly! Stay out of my room!
Molly: I wasn't in your room!
Andy: Then who was messing with my stuff?
Ken: Barbie, come with me! Live in my Dream House! I know it's crazy! I know we've just met! Aw, heck - you don't know me from GI Joe. But when I look at you I feel like we were...
Ken, Barbie: ...made for each other.
Ken, Barbie: Barbie: Yay!
Jessie: This isn't a family! It's a prison! You're a liar and a bully and I'd rather rot in this dumpster than join any family of yours!
Barbie: Jessie's right! Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not from the threat of force!
Barbie: Don't touch me! We're through!
Ken: Barbie, I...
Barbie: And give me my scarf back!
Ken: Ow.
