Veer Pratap Singh: I, Prisoner No. 786, look through the bars of my cell / I see days, months, years change to eons, / From the soil of this land I can smell my Bauji's fields / The burning sun reminds me of my Maati's cool buttermilk / The rains come with the swings of many seasons / The winter fills me with the warmth of the Lodi fires / They say this isn't your country, then why does it feel like mine? / They say that I do not look like him, then why does he look like me? / I, Prisoner No. 786, look through the bars of my cell / I see an angel who has come down from heaven / She calls herself Saamiya, and she calls me Veer / She's a complete stranger, but she treats me as her family / Hearing her truthful words, I feel alive once again / Hearing her promises and vow, I want to do something more / They say she isn't related, then why does she fight the world for me? / They say I'm not like her, then why does she look like me? / I, Prisoner No. 786, look through the bars of my cell / I see my Zaara wrapped in the colours of my village / In making my dreams come true, she has forgotten her own / In serving my people, she has left behind her own / Now I want to fill her heart with joy / I feel I could live another lifetime for her / They say my country is not hers, then why does she stay in my home? / They say I'm not like her, then why does she look like me? / I, Prisoner No. 786, look through the bars of my cell...
Veer Pratap Singh: After having 8-10 children, you come back to India and I'll carry you around the village on my bicycle.
Zaara Hayaat Khan: I'd be too fat by then to be carried on a cycle.
Veer Pratap Singh: I'll get you a tractor...
Narrator: One early morning / Lifting the dark blanket of the night / From its pillow of mountain peak / The sun lifted its head / And saw... / The valley's heart is filled with the season of love / And the branches of memories have sprouted / Innumerable blossoms of moments past / That begin to scent the air. / Unspoken, unheard yearnings / Half asleep, half awake / Look out sleepily at life / As it flows in wave upon wave / Every moment new, but also the same / Yes, this life! / Which encompasses love and grief / Meetings as well as partings, and a sense / That time is flowing like a river, whispering as it flows... / "The valley's heart is filled with the season of love / And the branches of memories have sprouted / Innumerable blossoms of moments past / That begin to scent the air... "
Zaara Hayaat Khan: Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh, thank you very much!
Veer Pratap Singh: For what?
Zaara Hayaat Khan: In exchange for my one day, you've given me a lifetime of memories and relationships!
Veer Pratap Singh: It was a promise from an Indian to a Pakistani. If I didn't fulfill it my country's honour would have been tarnished, right?
Zaara Hayaat Khan: I think getting Bebe's ashes here was God's way of bringing me here. I was destined to meet all of you.
Veer Pratap Singh: Do you believe in destiny?
Zaara Hayaat Khan: Of course. Don't you?
Veer Pratap Singh: Not until now. Now, I've begun to believe...
Chaudhary Sumer Singh: Be it a Pakistani, a Chinese or a Japanese, what does it matter? I don't see all this, all I see is that if the heart is pure, and if the right woman is sitting behind you with her hand on your shoulder, she will never let you fall.
Veer Pratap Singh: Come on, Zaara, let's go home...
Saamiya Siddiqui: Your Honour, Prosecution Counsel Mr Zaheer Khan was very quick to...
Zakir Ahmed: Zakir Ahmed...
Saamiya Siddiqui: ...say that the case is as transparant as water, but Mr Zaheer Khan forgets that...
Zakir Ahmed: Ms Saamiya Siddiqui, my name is Zakir Ahmed!
Saamiya Siddiqui: Being called by another name once has infuriated you to such an extent? Then just think, if you were called by another name every single day for twenty two years, can you imagine what it would feel like then?
Veer Pratap Singh, Zaara Hayaat Khan: For you, / I lived / with my lips sealed. / For you, / I lived / swallowing all my tears. / But in my heart, still burning / is the lamp of love / for you, / for you...
Veer Pratap Singh: That's an F-16 flying at the speed of 1200mph. When a plane tears through the skies, playing with the clouds, no one but a pilot can understand that feeling.
Zaara Hayaat Khan: How many times are you going to save my life?
Veer Pratap Singh: As many times as you put yourself at risk.
Saamiya Siddiqui: Here, take this and make our Zaara yours forever.
Saamiya Siddiqui: Which era do these two belong to?
Zaara Hayaat Khan: Can my father sacrifice his life for you?
Zaara Hayaat Khan: Relax, Ammi, I'm cool!
