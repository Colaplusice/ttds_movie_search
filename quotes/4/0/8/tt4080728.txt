Mähät: I'll tell Anders.
Ove: Go ahead, tell him. If you can make someone who drives an Audi understand. Four zeros on the grill and a fifth at the wheel!
Ove: One thing is certain though: Whatever we do in this life, no one gets out of it alive.
Ove: Some people say that fate is the result of our own foolishness.
Parvaneh: You're amazingly crap at dying.
Ove: The dog must stop peeing at our place.
Mähät: Don't listen to the mean old man, Prince. Anders! Did you see that? The old man tried to kill Prince.
Anders: What did you do to the dog?
Ove: That's not a dog. It looks like a winter boot with eyes.
Ove: Well done. Switch the engine off. Now you know how to park as well.
Parvaneh: What do you mean, "well done"? I just bumped into a car.
Ove: So what? It was just a Volvo.
Ove: I thought, I should pay back the money.
Sonja: Wouldn't it be nicer if you invite me to dinner?
Parvaneh: Did you think she would disappear just because you close the garage? You're a fool!
Ove: They say the brain works faster as it is dying. As if the outside world is moving in slow motion.
Parvaneh: I have thought of one thing.
Ove: Stop Boasting.
Ove: Hey! What are you doing?
Mähät: It scratched Prince.
Ove: Throw another stone and I'll sew a doormat with your mop!
Mähät: It is a chihuahua. And the cat certainly has both rabies and plague.
Ove: Oh, yes. Clearly, you do too. But we do not throw stones at you.
Mähät: You still think you can do whatever you want? Slimy fucking old man. I'll tell Anders.
Ove: Go ahead, tell him. If you can make someone who drives an Audi understand. Four zeros on the grill and a fifth at the wheel. If that dog pees in our area again, I'll electrify it. Idiot!
Parvaneh: I just thought of something.
Ove: Stop bragging.
Ove: One thing is certain. Whatever we do in this life, we will not live past it.
