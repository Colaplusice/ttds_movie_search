1
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,911
Hello. You have breakfast?

2
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,789
Hello. Yes, thank you.

3
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,500
I picked mushrooms.

4
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,794
I make you fry?

5
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,921
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

6
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,422
Thank you.

7
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,299
OK. Good day.

8
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,759
By the way ...

9
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,554
you have horses in the hotel?

10
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,305
No, not horses.

11
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:02,682
Really?

12
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:06,310
I've seen pictures on your site.

13
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,815
Yes, it's true. There are many
wild horses in the area.

14
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,316
In fact,

15
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,569
it's just to illustrate the site.

16
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:15,528
I see.

17
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:21,367
Hello, Mr. Aydin.

18
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:23,619
- Where have you been?
- I'm here.

19
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:27,623
The customer is there for breakfast,
there is no one to serve him.

20
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,000
Where is Hidayet?

21
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,543
Around.

22
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,840
I bring you your coffee, Mr. Aydin?

23
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,092
Want your coffee?

24
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,802
I found mushrooms.

25
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,846
Oh, where?

26
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,437
Nihal is standing?

27
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,607
Ms. Nihal got up early.
She took his breakfast.

28
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,570
She is in her room?

29
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,156
I do not know. I guess.

30
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,165
And Necla, she lifted?

31
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,417
Ms. Necla has not yet fallen.

32
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,795
Good.

33
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,804
Brings my coffee in my office.

34
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,220
WINTER SLEEP

35
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:15,499
- It does not fear anything with the dogs?
- Do not worry, Mr. Aydin.

36
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,756
Ekrem!

37
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,395
Ekrem!

38
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,405
The horse I'll take for you

39
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,616
is the strongest race
Turkey.

40
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,493
Stop, I saw 600 pounds.

41
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,953
They had what age?

42
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,956
In what state were their legs,
tendons?

43
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,250
And their lungs, their heart?

44
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,002
You do not know anything.

45
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:03,923
You are going to buy one
and then regret it.

46
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,593
You pay 500
and you resell 300.

47
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,513
I caught you a young,
robust.

48
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,516
It will keep you company
all your life.

49
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:14,850
What more?

50
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,685
- You can choose the color?
- Of course.

51
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,187
There is a choice.

52
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:22,775
I just have to check the hooves,
to be sure it is sturdy.

53
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,069
I caught one, there are two years.

54
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,115
I did participate
the endurance race of the Jockey Club.

55
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,659
He won the 80 km.

56
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,203
The guys laughed:
"Looks like a donkey."

57
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,248
"Donkeys guide the camels!"
I told them.

58
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,291
That's Anatolian horses.

59
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,336
He put them 45 minutes.
They were hippies.

60
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,547
- 45 minutes ...
- There were 27 horses.

61
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:49,552
These are the horses of our ancestors.
They are beautiful and durable.

62
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,512
We can do this when?

63
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,266
When I have time
and as the weather allows.

64
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,059
Next week?

65
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,310
When the mud has dried.

66
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,396
I'll let you know.

67
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,162
And the other,
he paid since the relaunch?

68
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,497
No, Mr. Aydin, still nothing.

69
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:04,210
Thanks to the complaint, the lawyer says
we will expel him in two months.

70
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,670
How are we going to do?

71
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,673
The law is the tenant side.

72
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,928
They do not know all that, Mr. Aydin.

73
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,931
They did not even have a lawyer,
I believe.

74
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,978
Sometimes I tell myself
family heritage or not

75
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,189
I should sell off everything.

76
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:30,277
They know you are tender,
that's why they do not pay.

77
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,324
Otherwise, here, it does not exist,
defaulters.

78
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,576
Do not pay the rent ...

79
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:42,873
But, Hidayat,
What can I do?

80
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,668
What I am tender?

81
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:49,630
I stick them a trial.
What to do?

82
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,756
As a matter of fact,

83
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,509
there would be plenty to do.

84
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,177
But nevermind ...

85
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,273
Son of a bitch!

86
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:10,609
Come here!

87
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,557
Arise.

88
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,309
Not move or I'll glue you one.

89
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,646
- What happened?
- I caught it.

90
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,524
Why it is tempered?

91
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:51,734
He fell into the water.

92
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:55,070
He wanted to jump
over the brook, he slipped.

93
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:59,116
- He hurt?
- No, it's just wet.

94
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,161
And why he threw that stone?

95
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,456
Tempered as it is,
it is better to be brought back quickly,

96
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,917
before he catches cold.
I'll tell you, Mr. Aydin.

97
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,127
OK.

98
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,183
Come down.

99
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,904
- I'll tell them two words.
- OK.

100
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,679
Hamdi Hodja!

101
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:26,954
Returns.

102
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,540
Hello.

103
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,376
Hello.

104
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,295
- What happen?
- Nothing.

105
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:39,174
The boy fell into the water,
it was quickly brought back.

106
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,682
- It happened where, how?
- Almost Issiz.

107
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,977
He slipped trying to jump
over the creek.

108
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,814
What is he doing there?

109
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:57,985
He hid
to watch our car.

110
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,737
He threw a stone
who broke the glass.

111
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:05,033
I could hardly hold the steering wheel
and brake to avoid the accident.

112
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,080
- My son Ilyas?
- Yes.

113
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,124
He broke a window with a stone?

114
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,959
You can go see.

115
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,175
How a kid
can break a window with a stone?

116
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,928
To you tell me, Ismail.
He's your son, after all.

117
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,932
Cut the crap.

118
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,726
Say what you seek.

119
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:31,977
What I seek?

120
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,980
The glass is there.
It is for you to explain.

121
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,654
This is not nothing, anyway.

122
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,908
We almost off the road, Ismail.
I should say anything?

123
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,118
I am wrong?

124
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,371
We will pay anyway.

125
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:55,042
It's not a question of money.

126
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,712
Call your son
and ask him what took him.

127
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,799
He refuses to talk to us.

128
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,846
We almost stay
with his shitty little pebble.

129
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,848
This is serious, Ismail.

130
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,519
Ilyas.

131
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,649
Come here.

132
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,915
It was you who threw that stone?

133
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,509
Is that you?

134
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:50,931
Ilyas!

135
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,517
You threw that stone?

136
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,284
Returns.

137
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,282
It was not worth it to do this.

138
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,410
We must not exaggerate either.

139
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:58,707
But it's important.
That's why I'm talking about it.

140
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:08,842
Hidayat.

141
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,534
And like that, okay?

142
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,954
Is that better?
You feel better?

143
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,127
A slap against a broken window?

144
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,254
That enough?

145
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,882
Or I recall and I continue?

146
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,762
What happens Ismail?

147
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,515
Hidayet?

148
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,810
Nothing, Hamdi. The small fell into the water,
they brought him back.

149
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,062
Badly we took.

150
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,567
Ilyas broke their glass.

151
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,528
- Their window?
- Yes.

152
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,571
They came to make us pay.

153
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,198
I said that myself?

154
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:17,160
I have not said that I brought
for he was not cold?

155
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,745
This is good.

156
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,793
The fridge and seized TV for rent
misery. That's not enough?

157
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,920
You will take the small?

158
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,382
- Ismail, none of that with me.
- What?

159
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,427
- Stop it back.
- I back myself?

160
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,303
Ismail, not looking me ...

161
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,847
What you got, you?

162
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,100
- All right, get out!
- How can you talk to me?

163
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,435
Cut the crap.

164
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:45,021
You just piss me home?
Who do you think you are?

165
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,481
I have no time to lose ...

166
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,776
- Let go of me, Hamdi.
- Ismail!

167
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,987
Bring up! You'll see!

168
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,989
Do not add.

169
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,324
Ismail, I speak to you ...

170
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,827
Let me go, I'll stuff it, this con.

171
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,537
Stop!

172
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,832
I'll nab, the bastard!

173
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,042
I'll rot your life!

174
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,503
Get out, motherfucker!

175
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,756
- Jure not son of a bitch!
- Shut up!

176
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,716
Ismail, enough, we go.

177
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:13,842
Come!

178
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,889
Screw you!

179
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,599
Make him go.

180
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,271
- What a moron ...
- Monte.

181
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,107
You answer to a drunk ...

182
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,610
But it does not stop swearing.

183
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,831
I'll see.

184
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,084
Crap.

185
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,602
Hidayat, I'm really sorry.

186
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:09,189
I'm as shocked as you.
I do not know what to say.

187
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,441
What happen?

188
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,694
What is this circus?
Beats me.

189
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,281
Without you
it does not allow everything.

190
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,159
No ... The broken window,

191
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,036
we will pay you.

192
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,789
Rent arrears also
as soon as possible.

193
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:30,377
We have not forgotten.
I will come myself to pay you.

194
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,337
We are in a bad way.

195
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:35,423
We did not come to that.
It's something else.

196
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,342
But we do not forget our debts.

197
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:42,597
M. Aydin's father knew well.
He never had to complain about us.

198
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,141
We got along very well.

199
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,353
You could do without this gesture

200
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:52,190
and we avoid shame.

201
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,485
Do not you think, Hidayet?
We have our dignity.

202
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,905
None of that, please, Hamdi.

203
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:04,160
We said nothing for months.
It is for us to justify ourselves?

204
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,246
All right, Hidayat.

205
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,749
But to send
suddenly a bailiff ...

206
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,126
You could talk to us.

207
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,336
Communication, it exists.

208
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:14,588
Hidayat, here we go.

209
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:18,592
We did not talk?
How many times I told you, Hamdi?

210
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,261
I told you or not?

211
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,762
I told him a thousand times.

212
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,931
Enough is enough. You will pay it later.

213
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,809
We do not tell you
it was going to work out?

214
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,687
So what? It has arranged?

215
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,731
It was arranged, Hamdi?

216
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,941
Come on, it's good.

217
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,985
Excuse me again, Mr. Aydin.

218
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,739
I'll settle this window history.
I will come myself to pay you.

219
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,284
You'll see that later.
No problem.

220
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,869
I'll quickly.

221
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,497
I'll come to see you
when you arrange it.

222
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,125
- OK.
- Do not worry.

223
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,336
You're wasting your time with anyone.

224
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:57,464
Poor guy. Species less than nothing.

225
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,675
- Sorry again.
- Less than nothing.

226
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,427
Come on, goodbye.

227
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,723
Good road.

228
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,693
Son of a bitch, asshole ...

229
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:38,254
Fatma ...

230
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,131
Come here.

231
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,508
What is this?

232
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,718
In your opinion?

233
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,220
Put it down.

234
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:46,888
Take that.

235
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,014
Pose.

236
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:52,394
- I put them where?
- Behind the terrace.

237
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,896
Be careful, do not break them.

238
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,564
Softly.

239
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,485
- Give me that.
- It's okay.

240
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:03,363
I am going to replace the glass.

241
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,824
- OK.
- Anything else?

242
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,244
Not.

243
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,331
I take an original
or a generic?

244
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,334
Where you going to find a home?

245
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:20,130
Nowhere.
That's why I ask.

246
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,297
Huh?

247
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,761
Come on, Hidayat.

248
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,614
- We have guests?
- Levent, the teacher, is there.

249
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:50,368
- They took the tea?
- And then they want coffee.

250
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,208
Hello.

251
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,627
- It was your trip?
- Yes.

252
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:02,047
- You need anything?
- No, thank you.

253
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,716
- Are you hungry?
- No, thank you.

254
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,040
What are you doing?

255
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,458
Not much.

256
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,127
My brother's tea.

257
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,089
How nice.

258
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,716
Thank God you're here, you.

259
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:50,887
- This is sage, not the lime tree.
- It will be fine.

260
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:55,391
Continue your work.
I go through magazines.

261
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,227
Yes, I beg you.

262
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,073
You write your editorial?

263
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,827
I try.

264
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,375
I read it last week.

265
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,174
I liked.

266
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,552
Which one?

267
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:34,430
The loss of the aesthetic sense
in the villages of Anatolia ...

268
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,099
- OK.
- It was good.

269
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:41,813
How you doing to find always
interesting ideas?

270
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,482
That you really enjoyed?

271
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,110
Yes, it was good.

272
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,529
You see,
it's not about money.

273
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,781
There has always been poverty.

274
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:55,827
Even three olives can be
beautifully arranged in a dish

275
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:59,122
or caught
the bottom of a bag.

276
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,249
I see what you mean.

277
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,544
You know, we went
at our tenant, the Hodja ...

278
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:05,628
Yes?

279
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:09,132
You should have seen the filth,
a real mess.

280
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,594
- Are you in?
- No, just the garden.

281
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:14,846
The house is in ruins.

282
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:19,142
Yet there was a woman who lives there.

283
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:22,979
Still, for a religious ...

284
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:26,524
We must lead by example
to the community,

285
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,610
be clean, impeccable.

286
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,987
Who is it? I know him?

287
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,572
Not.

288
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:36,117
An old tenant
time of our father.

289
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,995
I do not recognize him in the street.

290
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,789
One type ladle, a little shabby.

291
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,417
I do not know, me ...

292
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:48,254
religious
must lead by example, right?

293
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,548
Especially in the countryside.

294
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:54,594
Perhaps I should write about that?

295
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,222
Just thinking about it, it gives me the creeps.

296
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,143
Yes, write about what you want.

297
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:03,895
More ...

298
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,608
it would not be better to write
for a major newspaper

299
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,985
instead of that rag?

300
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:15,907
With all the evil that you give yourself ...

301
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:20,245
I do not feel
give me harm.

302
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:25,625
I do not know, I see you pat
all week on your computer,

303
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,835
I think ...

304
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:32,548
if you do not pricked me this journal

305
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:36,261
I do not even know it exists.

306
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,804
That's why.

307
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,182
I do not care of major newspapers.

308
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,937
My kingdom is admittedly small,
but at least I am a king.

309
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,232
But who reads this newspaper?

310
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,901
Who buys it?

311
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,196
Sorry, my dear Necla,
I disagree.

312
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:57,240
Not at all.

313
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,202
I get sometimes
letters from readers

314
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:04,539
that strengthen me
in what I do.

315
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,667
Despite all the evil that I give myself,
as you say,

316
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:10,128
I think it is worth it.

317
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:13,298
- For example, yesterday ...
- Yes, but sometimes on the internet

318
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,551
I see very bad authors
get to extol.

319
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,138
Everyone has his little fan club.

320
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:25,727
It should not take that seriously.

321
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,647
In any case, it can not be
a reference for you.

322
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:35,278
But hey, keep writing,
I will not distract you.

323
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:38,197
I'll get there,

324
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,325
quietly.

325
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,814
Not easy to mount
with the mud.

326
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,108
You do not want to put gravel?

327
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:17,195
I like to tourists,
it's natural.

328
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:22,200
I do not tell you to tar.
The gravel, too, is natural.

329
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,286
I lose half my customers
with gravel.

330
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:29,123
Already we have not
many people winter ...

331
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,418
Obviously with this mud!

332
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,295
good
if it discourages some.

333
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:37,048
A place like this, it must be earned.

334
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,883
A small sprint?

335
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:40,259
- OK.
- Here we go.

336
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:41,386
- Shall we?
- Yes.

337
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,012
Let's go.

338
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,224
You have grown or what?

339
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,850
- What?
- You've grown?

340
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,435
Not at all.

341
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:52,063
My stomach is emancipated
We do listen to me.

342
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,900
- Watch out, not let yourself go.
- And why?

343
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:00,613
I buried my wife.
I'm on my own.

344
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:04,951
It is you who should make you worry,
with a young and beautiful woman.

345
00:29:05,411 --> 00:29:09,705
If this continues, we will ask you
Nihal is if your daughter.

346
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:13,668
You're exaggerating, I'm not so bad.

347
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:17,422
Did not you see the carnage on your head?

348
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:19,799
There is a little thing ...

349
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,553
You know Garip,
the village next door to you?

350
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,471
Yes, but I have not been there.

351
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,306
No matter ...

352
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:31,310
He has a daughter of an association
who wrote to me.

353
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,480
I usually do not care
this kind of approach.

354
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,233
But then I was hit,
will know why.

355
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,819
It may be age.

356
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,530
I wonder
whether to take it seriously.

357
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,449
I would like your opinion.

358
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,325
She asks what, a donation?

359
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:50,371
Not much.
The question is ...

360
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:51,581
Between Fatma.

361
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,918
... That is if it is sincere
or is looking for something else.

362
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,212
As you're psychologist,

363
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,507
you'll know to read between the lines,
I'm sure.

364
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:02,717
That's all.

365
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,135
Mr. Aydin, I put it where your tea?

366
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,345
On the table.

367
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:09,140
- Let me see the letter.
- She's on the computer.

368
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,517
- Go on, read it.
- OK.

369
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,311
Thank you, Fatma.

370
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:25,156
This is the area of Nihal,
good works. It is called?

371
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,867
Yes, if you want.

372
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,620
- It would be nice, right?
- Yes.

373
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,331
If available ...

374
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:43,925
Nihal?

375
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,636
Suavi Here, we discuss.

376
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,097
You can come if you're not busy?

377
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,475
We need your lights.

378
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,311
Yes, in my office.

379
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,230
Okay, for now.

380
00:30:58,232 --> 00:30:59,815
- It happens.
- Okay.

381
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,785
Suavi, how are you?

382
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,120
Very well. And you?

383
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,580
Well, thank you.

384
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,375
It was long.
All is well?

385
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,377
Yes, it will.

386
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,504
I do not go out of my farm.

387
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:24,298
What problems I may have?

388
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,093
And you? Your activities?

389
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,887
As usual, life goes on.

390
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:31,847
This time it will be me

391
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:35,309
the secret of your youth
and your eternal beauty.

392
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,563
That's very nice, thank you.

393
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:41,857
And your daughter,
Sometimes it comes to you?

394
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,693
From time to time.

395
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,153
She came to the end of his studies

396
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,364
and death of his mother.

397
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:49,865
And that's it.

398
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,993
- Always in London?
- Yes.

399
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:55,246
Why do not you go
live with it?

400
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,289
I?

401
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,291
Do not talk about bad luck.

402
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,587
I can not stand her English husband
who responds "Oh, lovely" to everything.

403
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,548
You exaggerate ...

404
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,385
So I summed up for Nihal.
Suavi already knows.

405
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,554
I received a letter the other day.

406
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:16,017
One young woman who teaches
sewing in a village in the area.

407
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,853
Basically, it asks for help.

408
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:22,690
I do not know what to think,
I'd like your opinion.

409
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,151
Help for what?

410
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:29,155
The letter is there, I read you?

411
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,073
Yes, go ahead.

412
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:36,370
Okay, I read it.

413
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:44,211
So ...

414
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,047
Here it is.

415
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,926
"Dear Mr. Aydin,

416
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,346
"First of all, I must tell you

417
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:56,223
"I am your admirer

418
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,226
"and I watch
every week your editorial

00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:14,325
"are proud to count
a person of your stature ... "

423
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:18,204
etc., etc. We spend all this ...

424
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:20,998
And here we again:

425
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,459
"Our group of teachers

426
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,921

a small building in Garip,

427
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,550
"our village so destitute,
to teach sewing and writing

428
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,303
"women of the village.

429
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:38,265
"The mayor has supported us
as he could.

430
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,186
"But despite our best efforts
and lack of resources,

431
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:44,230
"building remained unfinished.

432
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:48,359
"The prefecture rejected

433
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:52,154
"We are abandoned to our fate

434
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,865
"with good intentions
and hopes.

435
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,411
"Trying to find a solution,

436
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,790
"I remembered your article
'Flowers of the steppes'.

437
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,042
"To believe that you had written

00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:09,505
"We've all read back,

"Far be it from me

00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:17,680
"Know that I do not feel

00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,152
"I will not waste your time.

"We know that you have links

"and with the administration.

"You also have relationships

"That's why we are writing.

00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:51,213
"Thank you,

00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,132
"With all due respect."

451
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,848
There you go.

452
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:02,850
That's it.

453
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,561
I do not know ...

454
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:10,733
It looks like a good girl,
intelligent, well-intentioned.

455
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,569
It is idealistic,
persevering, courageous.

456
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,447
It probably deserves to be supported.

457
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,157
Can not find?

458
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:28,834
Nihal?

459
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,839
Frankly ...

460
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:38,093
I can not find.

461
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,846
I receive every day
emails like this.

462
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:42,848
Good.

463
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:46,811
What does not suit you,
exactly?

464
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,187
Well ...

465
00:35:48,522 --> 00:35:52,733
it would be luxury
construct a building for, right?

466
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,653
In a backwater ...

467
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,406
Normally, the village mayor
they find a place,

468
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,118
they decorate it a bit and that's it.

469
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:07,873
I find there,
she asks too much.

470
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:11,043
Even Prefecture
does not help.

471
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:15,756
Now if we go by the logic
Administration ...

472
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,054
I do not know.

473
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,098
And Suavi, what do you say?

474
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:26,308
I do not know what to say.

475
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:31,230
We could not meet you,
I and other notables of the area

476
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,232
to help them?

477
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,651
Aydin, I have a significant head me?

478
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:39,780
Only my belly that is notable.
And again, he emancipated!

479
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:42,241
Anyway ...

480
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,413
I must say that your reaction
surprises me Nihal.

481
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,373
Why?

482
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,542
Because ...

483
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:57,089
thanks to you, this place is more like
an NGO than a hotel.

484
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,884
Where are you getting at?

485
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,135
Say ...

486
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,597
How you, philanthropist patented,

487
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:08,100
who have helped the smallest school
in the region,

488
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,853
rejettes so firmly that request?

489
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,521
I do not understand.

490
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,523
Simple Explanation.

491
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,901
It is a matter of priority.

492
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:21,030
Primary schools
of leaking roofs, broken windows.

493
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,116
Children wear gloves in class.

494
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,620
It seems logical to me
to begin with, right?

495
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:32,583
We are trying for months
to raise funds,

496
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,502
but it never made you interested.

497
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:39,214
And there,
you have a sudden fit of generosity.

498
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:45,429
Well, I expect the world
I'll leave you.

499
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:50,225
Suavi, spend me
before you go?

500
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,810
Of course.

501
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:55,022
So I do not greet you.
At right away.

502
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,999
You know what I think?

503
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:19,421
Misery, poverty,
it is a natural disaster.

504
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,008
God, somehow.

505
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,136
We can not oppose the destiny.

506
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:30,391
But God has endowed us with intelligence
to address those issues.

507
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,309
That is true.

508
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:35,104
That's true, but still,

509
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:40,442
there are people who came
on earth for that.

510
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,404
You have to let them do their job.

511
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,365
You, you're a creative artist.

512
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,076
Why you'll meddle in this?

513
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:52,037
Take care of your work.

514
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,545
Mr. Aydin, Hamdi is there.

515
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,214
- What Hamdi?
- Hamdi Hodja, the imam.

516
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,259
I'm going. You can get it here.

517
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,011
Rest a little.

518
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:09,430
I have plenty of things to do.

519
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,766
The work of the farm.

520
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:15,894
I'll walk Suavi.
You can install the Hodja here.

521
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:16,895
OK.

522
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,812
Welcome, Hamdi Hodja.

523
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,856
Thank you, Mr. Aydin.

524
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,402
You could keep your shoes.
It's not very clean here.

525
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:09,448
They were full of mud.
It's better that way.

526
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,034
- I think you're slippers.
- Do not bother.

527
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:16,246
One minute. The floor is cold.

528
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:26,256
Fatma, you can bring slippers?
With tea and cakes.

529
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:27,508
OK.

530
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:32,012
Sit down, Hamdi Hodja.

531
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,897
So Hamdi Hodja, I'm listening.

532
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:45,651
In fact, Mr. Aydin,
I do not know where to start.

533
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,488
You came home the other day,
it was a little ...

534
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,781
Sorry ...

535
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,034
Air is missing here. I can?

536
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,286
I open a little.

537
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,377
Yes?

538
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:06,755
Really, I do not know
how you say ...

539
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:10,425
It was very embarrassing for us.
We're sorry, really.

540
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,636
But nobody thought wrong.

541
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:14,972
The boy made a mistake.

542
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,141
He took it badly what happened.

543
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,643
But it's a kid.

544
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:21,311
Of course.

545
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:24,523
You asked
why he did that?

546
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:27,234
Because this incident ...

547
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:31,572
could have serious consequences.

548
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,741
Of course, I asked him.

549
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,326
So what?

550
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:40,664
In fact, Mr. Aydin,

551
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:43,292
it was very marked by the seizure.

552
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,170
That's why he made this mistake.

553
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:49,548
Especially because his father
was beaten up.

554
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,341
Beat?

555
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:54,761
When they came for the capture,

556
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,891
of course, Ismail wanted to prevent.

557
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,143
And the police were there.

558
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,395
So it has degenerated.

559
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,023
I see.

560
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:11,361
So, this is our car taking,
is that it?

561
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:14,740
That's about it. I'm sorry.

562
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:18,368
But now,
the little one wants.

563
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:21,997
He regrets.
He wants to come kiss your hand.

564
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:23,874
It's no go.

565
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,752
It takes, really.

566
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,670
As I have said,

567
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,465
we have always paid our debts.

568
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,884
I have a little money on me.

569
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:37,262
I came to pay for the window.

570
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:39,264
How much?

571
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:42,267
No, it is not important.

572
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:45,062
You will see with Hidayat.

573
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,439
I do not know.

574
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:50,234
I think it's in the 70 pounds.

575
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,903
It is better to talk to Hidayat.

576
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,655
70 pounds?

577
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:58,533
70 pounds for a single window?

578
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,411
Yes.

579
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:05,415
And again,
this is not an original part.

580
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,835
Hidayet can show you the invoice.

581
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:11,088
In fact ...

582
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,882
I do not know if I have enough.

583
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:17,177
Wait, I check with Hidayat.

584
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:22,057
But hey, it does not matter,
It can wait.

585
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,810
We will not make a fuss.

586
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,853
This is only a glass.

587
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:29,273
You think?

588
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,943
In this case, I will not stagger.

589
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,779
I will pay all of a sudden.

590
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:37,948
It will be simpler.

591
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:40,284
Hello?

592
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,119
Are you there?

593
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:47,457
Nothing, actually. I wanted to know
the price of the repair of the glass.

594
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:49,960
I had retained 70 pounds.

595
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:53,964
Really?

596
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:57,634
I was wrong then.
Okay, thank you.

597
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,846
No, it's not worth it.

598
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:05,559
I was wrong.
It was not 70 but 170 pounds.

599
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,687
170 pounds?

600
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:11,648
How so?

601
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:13,734
This is the price, that's all.

602
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,863
Hidayet can show you the invoice.

603
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,533
Though. I have not asked
if he had taken.

604
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,493
That's incredible.

605
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,371
Glass, still ...

606
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:27,664
It's weird.

607
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:31,460
There is always a mistake, Mr. Aydin.

608
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,719
What is it?
There were not men?

609
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,513
No, we do not use it at the hotel.

610
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,223
Fatma took them home.

611
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:49,978
Will do. As long as it keeps me
touching the ground ...

612
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,564
Where do I put the tea?

613
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:57,152
There. I take that.

614
00:44:58,071 --> 00:45:00,989
Hamdi Hodja, come here.

615
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:10,457
Thank you.

616
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:29,267
Listen, Hamdi.

617
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:34,314
I own several houses
and shops in town.

618
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:36,108
Not to me only, actually ...

619
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,902
They also belong
my sister Necla.

620
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:42,697
If I had to take care of it
personally

621
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:47,077
I could not work
on my books and articles.

622
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:48,954
Do you understand?

623
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:54,709
That's why Hidayat and lawyers
caring for rent and trial.

624
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,880
I am not aware
what they do.

625
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,508
And if I say, I forget.

626
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,429
The other day your brother
elder or younger ...

627
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,930
My older brother.

628
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,558
He said displaced things.

629
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:12,269
But things are clear ...

630
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,895
not to mention the seizure,

631
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:18,400
I did not even know
you were my tenants.

632
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:23,864
These procedures are automatic
in case of unpaid rent.

633
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:25,866
Do you understand?

634
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,952
But of course, Mr. Aydin,
that goes without saying.

635
00:46:29,162 --> 00:46:31,288
You have to do this.

636
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:34,458
You have been very forgiving
to us.

637
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:38,211
But as Ismail out of prison,

638
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:40,714
it has not been able to recover.

639
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,716
We do not give him a job.

640
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,802
I do not know why,
but it's like that.

641
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:50,390
So we need a little time
to return.

642
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:54,686
And then if you could just
ensure

643
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,856
that we may not be expelled ...

644
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:01,401
We will find a solution
quickly.

645
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:03,570
We are committed to this house.

646
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:07,032
I spent my entire childhood.

647
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:09,826
If you leave us a little time ...

648
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:12,162
What can I say?

649
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,331
I understand you, but ...

650
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,043
you have to talk to Hidayat.

651
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,795
I am not aware of anything.

652
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:23,882
You spoke to Hidayet?

653
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,051
- No.
- Talk to him.

654
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:27,802
Do you understand?

655
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,723
Hidayet and lawyers are there.
It's not me you should come and see.

656
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,226
It is they who know everything.

657
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,355
Do not come back to me.

658
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:42,150
I do not want to mislead.

659
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:50,283
"In a country with 99% Muslims,

660
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:53,411
"the people did not he deserves
religious

661
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,664
"clean, educated, well behaved

662
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:59,960
"that emit a reassuring image?

663
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:04,631
"The weekly sermon
prepared by our imams,

664
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,593
"through their readings,

665
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,763
"would be received by believers
with pleasure and admiration

666
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:13,848
"and raise them.

667
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:18,562
"Islam is a religion
civilization and high culture. "

668
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,695
So what?

669
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,030
That's good.

670
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:31,491
It's not too hard, was it?

671
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:32,701
Not.

672
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,662
Nothing that can be confusing?

673
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:36,580
Not.

674
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,375
You do not talk
directly from religion.

675
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:44,796
You speak of the practice,
of those who apply.

676
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:48,508
And in the end, I say that Islam
is a high cultural religion.

677
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:50,051
That's it.

678
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:53,013
Frankly, I do not care a bit.

679
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,892
But this is a sensitive subject.

680
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:04,024
This type was so pissed
I could not help but write.

681
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:07,986
In fact, it has managed to become
the subject of my article.

682
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:12,782
With this foul air,
sneaky, always to tack ...

683
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:14,534
See?

684
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:21,541
I played an imam once
I had good reviews.

685
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:25,670
And then, when I see this guy,
I tell myself that I had it all wrong.

686
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,882
Full details escaped me.

687
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,052
You had seen this room?

688
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:34,679
Which room?

689
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,890
The one where I was an imam.

690
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,683
"Wounded Bird".

691
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:40,143
I do not feel anything.

692
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:44,230
I went on stage
seeking the toilet.

693
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:49,152
It had to be
when I was abroad.

694
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,322
I came running:
"Where are the restrooms?"

695
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:56,368
- No ... It was a comedy?
- Yes.

696
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,789
- And before ...
- It tells me nothing.

697
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,212
I have a question to ask you.

698
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,633
Do not oppose evil,

699
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:14,594
it inspires you what?

700
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,472
How?

701
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:22,435
What does not oppose evil
for you?

702
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:25,313
Do not oppose evil?

703
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,400
How do you understand that?

704
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:30,235
I do not know ...

705
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:34,155
Make yourself attacked by robbers
and you do not opposing you there?

706
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,074
I guess that's it.

707
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:39,869
I do not want an example.
A logical definition.

708
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:42,622
I see no logic in that.

709
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:45,500
A logical definition ...

710
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:48,044
Do not oppose evil,

711
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,132
it remain indifferent to acts

712
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:55,301
condemned by morality.

713
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:56,678
It suits you?

714
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:00,056
And if we were

715
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,101
make this absence
opposition to evil

716
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,603
the principle of our behavior,

717
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,064
what would our lives?

718
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:10,108
What would they look like?

719
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:12,819
What would they look like?

720
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,238
Thieves, killers,
pulluleraient nerds,

721
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:18,158
the world would be ablaze.

722
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:21,703
- What's left?
- It would ...

723
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:26,750
the crippled and crazy houses.
I know, me.

724
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,502
You may be right.

725
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:33,256
But I could not pass me
as you do.

726
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:35,633
What I scrolled me?

727
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:39,220
You should think about it.

728
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,723
You went fast.

729
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,267
There's nothing to do more.

730
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:47,604
It hurts you, you will not opposing you there.
That's it.

731
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,063
What else?

732
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,316
I feel

733
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:54,861
they hide their faces
in the fight against evil.

734
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,907
As if we did not
touch on all aspects.

735
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,408
Who, for example?

736
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:03,912
Fatma, this honey is frozen.
There else?

737
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:04,746
I'll see.

738
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:07,457
Otherwise, put it in hot water.

739
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:11,753
Instead of striving against evil,
why not do the opposite?

740
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,964
If you do not want
that you steal this table,

741
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:18,051
it may be best
propose to the thief.

742
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,220
That may be a better solution.

743
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,597
So if I want to marry a girl

744
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:24,766
for the money of his father,

745
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,143
it should jump on my neck

746
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:30,438
to counteract my cynical calculation.
Is that it?

747
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,942
It might feel shame,
remorse

748
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,902
and acknowledge his fault.

749
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,695
We must give him the opportunity.

750
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,614
What nonsense!

751
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:44,285
Let the crowds get slaughtered
hoping remorse killers.

752
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,914
Even in a soap opera,
it does not happen!

753
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:51,125
You can say what you want.
My choice is made.

754
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:56,548
I see no reason to oppose
the evil that would seek me personally.

755
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:00,218
Someone intends to kill me?
Welcome!

756
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,556
If I was defending myself,

757
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,934
the murderer
without departing grew up.

758
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,939
But you could stay alive.

759
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,357
It would perhaps be up?

760
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:16,442
Not so sure, believe me.

761
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:20,029
We stop this discussion.
It depresses me.

762
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:21,531
You say what, Nihal?

763
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,450
As a matter of fact,
I do not understand the issue.

764
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,203
Where did you get this need?

765
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:29,289
What makes you feel that way?

766
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:32,584
This is not a need but an idea.

767
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:35,003
She wants to help the trouble making.

768
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:38,631
Do you mind? Is your solution
to eradicate evil?

769
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:41,509
Or to achieve peace?

770
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:45,430
She wants to make life easier
malefactors.

771
00:53:45,598 --> 00:53:49,100
No, I say let
luck to the one who hurt

772
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,019
to feel regret.

773
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,396
A chance bastards, it's good!

774
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,648
Do not pretend
not understanding.

775
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:57,609
That's what I understand, my heart.

776
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,444
How did you do, my heart?

777
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:00,570
That's what she said:

778
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:03,114
Help the bastards,
they may have shame.

779
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:05,408
- That's not it.
- That's what I understood.

780
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:07,660
How can you understand that?

781
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,537
What do you understand?

782
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:13,166
It is very clear what she says.

783
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:18,630
If you hurt me,
a thief or anyone,

784
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,507
I do not show resistance and therefore,

785
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:23,301
I make it conscious ...

786
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,888
But, stop!
What fly has stung you?

787
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,933
What is this story
help the evil?

788
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:31,476
Who said that?

789
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,354
It's supposed to fight?

790
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:36,481
You we provoked, there.

791
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,442
I tell you what I understand,
my darling.

792
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:41,986
It's very simple to understand.

793
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:44,864
She said that if you hurt us,

794
00:54:45,074 --> 00:54:50,536
not to oppose it may encourage
the thief to give up, to regret.

795
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,080
How is this possible?

796
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,915
That's not the issue.

797
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,917
I say we can try.

798
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,753
Jews should have gone
voluntarily in the camps,

799
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:00,880
it would have rested Hitler.

800
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:04,717
He would have said:"They are already there,
longer worth gassing "?

801
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:07,637
- Are you kidding?
- No, that's what I understand.

802
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,557
Helping criminals to do evil
to make them regret it.

803
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:13,601
Never heard of such a thing!

804
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:14,811
Either I do not understand,

805
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:18,564
or you do not you expressed
quite clearly.

806
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,233
Mr. Aydin ...

807
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:22,360
they are still there.

808
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,945
- Who?
- Hamdi.

809
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:27,115
- What Hamdi? Hamdi Hodja?
- Yes.

810
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,826
- Is he here?
- Yes, there.

811
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,744
I saw the other day.
He wants what?

812
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:34,038
He tells me nothing.

813
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,957
He mysteries.

814
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:37,500
Please, not him.

815
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:39,502
You told him that I was there?

816
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:41,629
I said that I would see.

817
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,882
Tell him I'm not there.
He may want to leave something.

818
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,094
It came yesterday too.
He left nothing.

819
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,472
- He came yesterday?
- Yes.

820
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:52,682
You did not tell me?

821
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,684
But if.

822
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,061
You were in bed, I returned.

823
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,148
Really?

824
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,692
- Small is still with him.
- What a?

825
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,569
One who broke our glass.

826
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,529
He was there yesterday too.

827
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:08,906
I feel it's going to be complicated.

828
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:11,993
You can talk to him.
They did all this way.

829
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,703
What do you fear?

830
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,288
Nothing, that's not it.

831
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:18,833
He whines, he did not finish his sentences ...
It annoys me.

832
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:22,295
But they are there.
We will not return.

833
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:26,424
Well, okay, let them in.

834
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,676
We'll see what he wants.

835
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:32,305
I'll apply your lesson,
to see if I understood.

836
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:33,598
Hamdi arrives,

837
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,808
I will accept all of it without flinching.

838
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:39,270
- But it does not hurt you.
- Who knows?

839
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,315
It is not yet known.
But I will leave me.

840
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:44,567
We'll see if I understood.

841
00:56:44,777 --> 00:56:46,486
- You're afraid he has a knife?
- May be!

842
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,366
Between Hamdi Hodja.

843
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,369
Welcome, Mr. Hamdi.

844
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:56,537
Thank you.

845
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:59,540
Sorry to bother you.

846
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:02,001
You do not disturb us.

847
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:04,087
You buffet breakfast with us?

848
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:07,465
Thank you, ma'am. We did not go hungry.

849
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:11,135
Sit down.
Fatma brings tea for our guests.

850
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:13,387
And cakes for breakfast.

851
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:15,181
The valley is muddy.

852
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,558
Sorry,
we are covered in mud.

853
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:19,811
What were you doing in the valley?

854
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:22,563
- You have arrived where?
- By the shortcut.

855
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:25,900
I saw two figures.
That was you?

856
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,443
- Surely.
- Yikes!

857
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:31,114
You have come to the foot of the village?

858
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,991
So, why?

859
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,620
Because it is far away.

860
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:40,623
Yes, it is far away.

861
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:42,458
That is true.

862
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,588
The last time too,
you were on foot?

863
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:49,757
Yesterday, I mean.

864
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,175
Yes.

865
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,302
Say ...

866
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:55,471
Why did not you say anything?

867
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:59,100
Hidayet could take you home.

868
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:01,602
I'm sorry.

869
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:03,646
There's nothing.

870
00:58:03,856 --> 00:58:07,441
It is as sport to us.
There is no harm.

871
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,237
Aydin, they are standing ...

872
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:14,490
Fatma brings tea there.

873
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,826
Sit down.

874
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,495
You do not have a moped?

875
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:23,249
I'm going to buy a
when it will get better.

876
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,668
- It would be nice.
- God willing.

877
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:29,213
Fortunately the house
is next to the mosque.

878
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:33,342
Otherwise, five round trips per day,
I would have struggled.

879
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:35,011
God bless you.

880
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,762
This is your son?

881
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,806
- It suits you.
- No.

882
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:41,350
He is the son of my elder brother.

883
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:44,020
I have no children.

884
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:47,815
By dint of working,
I have not been able to get married.

885
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:49,859
My destiny, I guess.

886
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,445
It will come. You're young.

887
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,198
Ilyas is like my son.

888
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:58,117
Of course.
You're what class, Ilyas?

889
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,704
Say it, my child. Which class?

890
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,748
CM2.

891
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:06,918
Mr. Aydin ...

892
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,587
I go to the industrial area.

893
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:12,757
- What for?
- Servicing the door.

894
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,842
It can not wait?

895
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,303
If, but there is also
the engine whines.

896
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,179
He whines?

897
00:59:18,347 --> 00:59:21,182
Yes, as a vibration noise.

898
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:25,394
This is perhaps the cylinders.
I would not want to damage the engine.

899
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,190
Okay, go ahead.

900
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,498
Mr. Aydin,
as I have already said,

901
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:49,168
since the incident,
little is really sorry.

902
00:59:49,378 --> 00:59:51,921
- What incident?
- The broken glass.

903
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,839
It's ancient history.

904
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:56,884
But the poor little
feels really bad,

905
00:59:57,052 --> 01:00:00,596
he feels guilty for that day.

906
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,976
It is not easy
to apologize.

907
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:08,396
You have to be mature
to learn to repent.

908
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,232
But as resentment
persist,

909
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,567
we can not find peace.

910
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:16,570
Our Prophet said:

911
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,240
"Repentance is the penance."

912
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:24,245
If someone convinces us
she regrets his actions,

913
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:29,000
we have no other choice
to forgive him.

914
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:30,668
So, believe me.

915
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:34,755
Our Ilyas is smart
and he has a heart of gold.

916
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,883
Despite his young age,
he listened to my advice.

917
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:40,428
He thought about it and gave me reason.

918
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,264
And he wanted to come with me
today

919
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,391
to kiss your hand.

920
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,893
I said to him:
"This is what you must do.

921
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:53,607
"Shows you regret
and Mr. Aydin certainly forgive you. "

922
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:54,775
Is not it?

923
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:58,571
This is not necessary.
All that does not matter.

924
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,615
But if it is necessary.

925
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:06,203
Otherwise, it will be his fault.

926
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,873
This would be the worst danger.

927
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,500
Right, Ilyas?

928
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:15,296
It's nothing.
I do not like the hand kissing.

929
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,298
My father also does not like it.

930
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,676
They fought for power
kiss her hand. Right, Necla?

931
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:23,304
No, otherwise it would not be at peace.

932
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,097
Is not it, boy?

933
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:28,351
Come on, come on,
will kiss the hand of Mr. Aydin.

934
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:38,235
Ilyas?

935
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:42,823
We did not say we would
both without telling Dad?

936
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:45,743
You want me to shame
in front of everyone?

937
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:49,663
Come on, my boy,
will kiss the hand of Mr. Aydin.

938
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,582
Well, okay.

939
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:05,221
Come on, Ilyas. Mr. Aydin expected.

940
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:12,997
Do not shoot! Soft.

941
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:30,890
Go ahead, shoot.

942
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,313
Let him breathe.

943
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,287
Stay away.

944
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,008
Wasabi.

945
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:09,470
It goes up the nose, right?

946
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:13,307
In Japan too, we like spicy.

947
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:15,184
You do not eat in Japan?

948
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,811
When I was little,

949
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,647
I did not like that.

950
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:24,527
But now I love wasabi.

951
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:00,497
How cold!

952
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:03,250
I'm frozen to the bone.

953
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:09,882
What are you doing?

954
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:11,925
Nothing.

955
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:17,348
Where is Aydin?

956
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:20,559
I do not know.

957
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,854
Perhaps the village.
It is not in his office?

958
01:06:24,064 --> 01:06:25,230
Not.

959
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:50,964
I'll make some more coffee. Want some?

960
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:55,177
You want a coffee?

961
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,931
I'll take, yes.

962
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:03,560
I do not know what to do
with the new good.

963
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,438
She put the glasses that I love
Dishwasher safe.

964
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:07,898
She broke both.

965
01:07:08,108 --> 01:07:09,608
She told me.

966
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:14,613
They are so thin. It's obvious
they do not go in the dishwasher.

967
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:18,158
I will perhaps make him pay
so that she understands.

968
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:20,577
Do not exaggerate. Forget it.

969
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:21,995
I am not exaggerating.

970
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:25,082
There are objects that we take.

971
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:28,919
I had bought in Istanbul.
We find them anymore.

972
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:30,796
I understand,

973
01:07:30,964 --> 01:07:32,798
but these are just the glasses.

974
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:37,845
You may be right. I do not know.

975
01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:46,812
It may be you who reason.

976
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:52,526
I know I've become
very irritable these days.

977
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,281
I'm worried.

978
01:07:58,241 --> 01:08:00,033
What kind?

979
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:02,995
There are too many things in my head.

980
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:08,000
My ex has become alcoholic.

981
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:10,669
- Who? Necdet?
- Yes.

982
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:13,756
He always had
a good run, right?

983
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:16,049
That is true.

984
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,387
But he drinks more
since our separation.

985
01:08:21,139 --> 01:08:23,474
It seems that it starts in the morning.

986
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:28,854
You can not help it.

987
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:30,731
I know.

988
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,649
But sometimes

989
01:08:33,485 --> 01:08:37,362
I wonder if we are not worse
since the divorce.

990
01:08:37,906 --> 01:08:41,742
Him there, in this state,
me here, unhappy ...

991
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,870
- This is really what you think?
- Say ...

992
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:51,251
I am trying to understand
where I planted me

993
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:53,587
why we got there.

994
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:55,839
If you have not found, from the time,

995
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:58,801
Perhaps that is wrong
is not on your side.

996
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:00,969
Do not you think?

997
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:03,138
You want me to rally the flock

998
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:07,017
those who believe
that evil always comes from the other?

999
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:07,851
Not.

1000
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:11,271
But you're not
necessarily fault either.

1001
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:12,940
That's what I say.

1002
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:15,943
Why deny that?

1003
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:19,238
Because I do not see any interest.

1004
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:24,409
A sensible person should care
as its share of responsibility.

1005
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:28,664
I think a little of blindness
can not hurt.

1006
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:30,874
But hey, if you insist,

1007
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,336
where do you deceived Thee?

1008
01:09:34,546 --> 01:09:36,547
I do not know.

1009
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,424
I think, for example,

1010
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:45,764
if I had missed
all the harm he did to me,

1011
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:51,019
if I was not against me,

1012
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:54,606
divorcing, for example,

1013
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:01,405
I would perhaps put
facing the wrong.

1014
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:03,198
I do not know.

1015
01:10:03,867 --> 01:10:08,120
I wonder what would have changed
if I had acted differently.

1016
01:10:08,329 --> 01:10:14,167
You think that if you were not you
opposed to the evil that was you,

1017
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:17,004
he was full of remorse
of himself?

1018
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:20,549
Yes, you did say,
that's what I think.

1019
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:25,721
It may seem absurd
but it is not.

1020
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:30,017
Sorry, Necla,
but that does not make sense.

1021
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:33,729
I think after a certain age,
People do not change.

1022
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:38,108
On the contrary,
bad habits settle.

1023
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:41,528
So do not protest against evil

1024
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:47,034
only serves to reinforce the other
in what he does.

1025
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:49,286
I think he regrets now.

1026
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:52,497
This is what makes me say that.

1027
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:54,374
I feel it.

1028
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:59,671
I think he would come find me,
if the opportunity arose.

1029
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:04,301
If I lived elsewhere,
he would have already done.

1030
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:08,555
But after all that has happened,

1031
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:12,225
he fears some Aydin.

1032
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:18,357
You know what crosses my mind,
sometimes?

1033
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:23,904
On the go and ask his forgiveness.

1034
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:26,782
At Necdet?

1035
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:28,992
Yes.

1036
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:33,497
But you did nothing wrong.

1037
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:35,123
Exactly.

1038
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:38,168
This is the beauty of it.

1039
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:41,129
Put another embarrassment.

1040
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:45,092
And perhaps the best out of him.

1041
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:54,935
You should not have abused a little
serials, lately?

1042
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:57,854
What relationship?

1043
01:11:58,398 --> 01:12:00,315
Only where you see it.

1044
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,903
But there is nothing to say.

1045
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:06,780
It's your choice.

1046
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:09,282
I find it absurd

1047
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:13,996
but if you want to,
no one will stop you.

1048
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:15,998
Do what you want.

1049
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:20,585
But it will assume
the consequences.

1050
01:12:21,129 --> 01:12:22,754
Do not forget that.

1051
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:24,965
That's what I think.

1052
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:43,316
These small expressions
sarcastic, ambiguous,

1053
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:47,904
these small lip movements
cynical ...

1054
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:52,200
I am really fed up.
I hate them.

1055
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,912
Necla, do not go too far,
please.

1056
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,123
Basically, if I ask for forgiveness Necdet,

1057
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:01,710
it would be just to get rid
you and all that.

1058
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:03,837
I can see it now.

1059
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:08,300
Nobody is going to stop me?
Thank goodness!

1060
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:11,303
I do not need permission.

1061
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:14,222
I am in my father here.

1062
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:16,600
I go and I come as I want.

1063
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:20,187
And

1064
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:25,400
I already morflé
when I told you your truths.

1065
01:13:26,778 --> 01:13:28,987
And I am the only one.

1066
01:13:41,793 --> 01:13:42,959
looks

1067
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:44,044
Omar Sharif.

1068
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,420
How?

1069
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:48,757
The photo. This is Omar Sharif?

1070
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:51,760
Yes, he made a film here.

1071
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:53,053
Here at the hotel?

1072
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:55,055
No, in the corner.

1073
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:57,390
This is a very simple man.

1074
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,726
He took pictures with everyone.

1075
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:01,144
- Really?
- Yes.

1076
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:03,814
We do not believe that a star.

1077
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:05,232
It is not like that.

1078
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,317
What was this movie?

1079
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:10,779
I knew.
I do not want to say stupidity.

1080
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:12,572
Hello.

1081
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:17,994
Mr. Aydin, what movie they filmed here
Omar Sharif?

1082
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,831
- "Monsieur Ibrahim".
- That "Monsieur Ibrahim".

1083
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,584
That tells me something.
They turned where, exactly?

1084
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,712
In the vicinity.
At Ishtar, among others.

1085
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:29,297
- Ishtar?
- Yes.

1086
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:30,841
Interesting.

1087
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,968
I'll see where it is.

1088
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:37,806
Where are the others?

1089
01:14:39,225 --> 01:14:43,270
You mean Nihal and Necla?
They were there earlier.

1090
01:14:44,272 --> 01:14:45,438
What are they doing?

1091
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:46,982
They were talking about.

1092
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:49,609
They were there in the entrance.

1093
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:50,443
Oh ...

1094
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:53,530
I came out a minute
they were gone.

1095
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:55,991
They spoke normally?

1096
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:58,952
How does it normally?

1097
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,539
No matter.

1098
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:05,792
- Make us tea. Want some tea?
- Yes, thank you.

1099
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,752
You can do?

1100
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:15,510
It's right next door, Ishtar.
In front of Akkoy.

1101
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,930
All right, I've found. It is 20 km away.

1102
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:22,100
You know better than us, bravo.

1103
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:24,769
No, that's not it ...

1104
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,023
What do you doing?

1105
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:30,817
Your job, I mean.
You guide?

1106
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:33,320
No, not at all.

1107
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,488
I explore.

1108
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:38,617
It's not hard motorcycle winter?

1109
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:41,286
Preferred when it is difficult.

1110
01:15:41,913 --> 01:15:43,330
Who's "we"?

1111
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:45,248
The motocross riders.

1112
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:46,875
I see.

1113
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,590
I made this stuff
when I was in college.

1114
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:54,758
Really?

1115
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,427
All Europe by hitchhiking with friends.

1116
01:15:57,637 --> 01:16:01,806
When rowing,
we jumped on a train.

1117
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:04,893
It was the big time.

1118
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:09,481
We slept anywhere.

1119
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:13,235
The world belonged to us.

1120
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,363
Life seemed endless.

1121
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:20,951
The energy of youth.

1122
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,161
It's not my thing, the stop.

1123
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,164
I need autonomy.

1124
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:29,542
I want to
support myself.

1125
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:32,545
That's why I prefer the bike.

1126
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:36,174
And you sleep in hotels?

1127
01:16:36,384 --> 01:16:40,387
No, I have a tent,
but then I did not want to mount it.

1128
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:43,848
Here is a bit of a cave,

1129
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,850
as natural a tent.

1130
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:49,229
And then I had stuff to write.

1131
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:50,939
What do you write?

1132
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:52,565
What I saw.

1133
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:55,485
Travel blog?

1134
01:16:55,695 --> 01:16:58,613
There are also notes of trip.

1135
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:00,657
These are the kinds of tests.

1136
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:03,535
They will be published in book form.

1137
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:05,620
That's good.

1138
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:09,666
I also write a book.

1139
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:11,584
Really?

1140
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:14,671
A large keypad, although seriously.

1141
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,926
"History of Turkish theater."

1142
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,930
There has not been a serious study.

1143
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,140
Alas.

1144
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:28,268
I do a lot of research.

1145
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:31,021
Archives, articles,
books ...

1146
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:34,566
I'm almost done,
it remains for me to write.

1147
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:39,654
- The hardest part is getting started.
- That's right.

1148
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:44,993
- You are a former actor, right?
- Yes.

1149
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,786
Hence the subject.

1150
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:48,121
That's right, yes.

1151
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:50,707
I prefer to say "actor".

1152
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:54,210
The actors are in disgrace
these days.

1153
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:57,213
I did 25 years on stage.

1154
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:01,509
I can proudly say
I have turned in any soap opera.

1155
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:04,888
Despite tempting offers.

1156
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,685
I have never forgotten
that said Omar Sharif.

1157
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:13,855
When he knew I was an actor,

1158
01:18:14,065 --> 01:18:16,399
he told me with that look:

1159
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:20,570
"To play, to be honest."

1160
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:23,656
He's right.

1161
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:26,618
Class ...

1162
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,041
- By the way, we bought a horse.
- Really?

1163
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,626
It can be mounted?

1164
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:36,586
He must rest for a few days.

1165
01:18:36,796 --> 01:18:39,214
Later, perhaps.
You stay long?

1166
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:40,715
- Here?
- Yes.

1167
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:42,342
I know.

1168
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,094
I have not decided.

1169
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,429
I live from day to day.

1170
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:49,265
No tomorrow.

1171
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:52,977
Otherwise, it's not a journey.

1172
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:55,814
We lose the sense of adventure.

1173
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:57,816
How to tell?

1174
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:04,030
A life all mapped
is not a real life.

1175
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,657
As the saying goes:

1176
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:09,327
"While we are busy making
projects, life happens. "

1177
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:12,914
This is very true.

1178
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,958
You did not have to go to the market
Fatma?

1179
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:04,007
I told him to go alone.
I did not want.

1180
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:12,182
Have you finished the book I lent you?

1181
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:14,893
Long.

1182
01:20:16,604 --> 01:20:17,687
So what?

1183
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:20,398
What do you think?

1184
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:22,734
It deserves to be translated?

1185
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:27,197
No, I do not find
it worthwhile.

1186
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:42,295
Can I ask you a question?

1187
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:43,505
Of course.

1188
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:47,967
Unless the opposition to evil, in pity.

1189
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:51,846
I have a nice seam.

1190
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:54,933
I would like to write fast
and send the paper.

1191
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:59,938
Given your enthusiasm,
it must be mine.

1192
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:01,648
Not really.

1193
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:06,110
This is a result of the latter,
which aroused much interest.

1194
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:08,530
- Really?
- Yes.

1195
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:10,990
According Vehbi.

1196
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:14,786
He has received calls
full of innuendo.

1197
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:20,875
You know, your Vehbi.

1198
01:21:21,544 --> 01:21:23,628
It adds the reactions

1199
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:26,798
to give importance
to his newspaper.

1200
01:21:27,675 --> 01:21:29,884
Your article was not controversy.

1201
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:33,680
Indeed ...

1202
01:21:34,557 --> 01:21:36,558
but you never know.

1203
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:41,437
And
why you thickets your nose in it?

1204
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:45,525
You're an actor,
write about what you know.

1205
01:21:46,277 --> 01:21:49,571
Imagine that does not always choose
what we write.

1206
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,531
This is the subject that chooses you.

1207
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:56,661
Of course, everyone is free to write
on what he wants.

1208
01:21:57,162 --> 01:22:01,332
But then you reap what you sow.

1209
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:02,542
How so?

1210
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:06,546
Between an expert point of view
who devotes his life to a subject

1211
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:08,464
and that of an amateur,

1212
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:10,133
no picture.

1213
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:14,012
You do not think that outsider
may be relevant?

1214
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:16,097
Not in the field.

1215
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:18,641
What material?

1216
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:21,394
I'll tell you:The other day,

1217
01:22:21,604 --> 01:22:24,105
I have carefully read the article
you gave me.

1218
01:22:24,315 --> 01:22:27,233
I could not stop
and I read the old ones.

1219
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:28,610
So what?

1220
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:32,905
I may have been distracted before.

1221
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:35,283
But there they seemed different.

1222
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:37,577
What?

1223
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:39,579
I do not know ...

1224
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:42,832
Nihal has read them?

1225
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:45,168
I do not think so.

1226
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:47,712
My articles do not interest him.

1227
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:50,548
She has no interest
writes to her husband?

1228
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:53,551
Should she?

1229
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:56,512
She reads them may secretly.

1230
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:57,847
That's a kind.

1231
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:03,436
This is a specialist
the silent criticism.

1232
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:07,065
Anyway,
it would not be objective.

1233
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:08,399
Let ...

1234
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:11,611
- And so?
- As a matter of fact ...

1235
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:14,530
I would not have the courage.

1236
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:16,032
That is to say?

1237
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:18,409
Well ...

1238
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:23,456
lecturing
on topics that I know evil.

1239
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:25,375
Give lessons?

1240
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:29,712
This is more serious than I thought, then.

1241
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:33,299
I'm not saying they are bad.

1242
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:36,094
It's something else.

1243
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:37,512
Anything else?

1244
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,681
Another thing, what is it?

1245
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:42,392
They are ...

1246
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:46,396
Mediocre disembodied?

1247
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:48,398
I can not find the adjective.

1248
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:49,982
Harmless?

1249
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:52,860
Is that what you mean?

1250
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:55,154
I do not know. Maybe.

1251
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:00,952
You are very generous today.

1252
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:03,871
I try to be realistic.

1253
01:24:04,331 --> 01:24:06,290
That's good, bravo.

1254
01:24:07,084 --> 01:24:09,544
But I can stop being realistic.

1255
01:24:12,756 --> 01:24:16,008
Too late,
the genie is out of the bottle.

1256
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:19,512
You should know.

1257
01:24:19,722 --> 01:24:22,181
You ask me,
I give you.

1258
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:24,851
That's right, my faith.

1259
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:34,777
Before, you made our admiration.

1260
01:24:38,157 --> 01:24:39,907
it was believed

1261
01:24:40,117 --> 01:24:43,327
you would do great things,
you percerais.

1262
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:47,248
This did not happen.

1263
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,336
The mountain gave birth to a mouse.

1264
01:24:54,715 --> 01:24:56,966
Sorry to disappoint.

1265
01:24:57,176 --> 01:24:59,552
You have nothing to do.

1266
01:25:01,138 --> 01:25:03,431
We had set the bar too high.

1267
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,559
That's good, I feel reassured.

1268
01:25:08,312 --> 01:25:10,688
And "Flowers of the steppes"

1269
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:12,356
What did you think?

1270
01:25:12,566 --> 01:25:14,317
While there,

1271
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:18,279
it is precisely this article
that opened my eyes.

1272
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:22,825
Tell me more.

1273
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:26,788
How to tell?
This syrupy romanticism,

1274
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:31,125
this naive self-persuasion, low ...

1275
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:33,294
No risk.

1276
01:25:34,505 --> 01:25:36,464
The author just looking ...

1277
01:25:37,216 --> 01:25:40,510
at truism

1278
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:42,637
for the sake of convenience.

1279
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:45,723
And this lyrical dressing

1280
01:25:45,933 --> 01:25:49,310
that stinks sentimentality ...

1281
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:53,731
I see. It's unbearable to you, actually.

1282
01:25:53,941 --> 01:25:56,484
I acknowledge that I do not like this style.

1283
01:25:56,735 --> 01:26:00,196
Listening to you,
I should stop writing.

1284
01:26:01,281 --> 01:26:04,116
But no. This is only my point of view.

1285
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:07,870
Fortunately, other
do not think like you.

1286
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:10,414
Certainly.

1287
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:15,419
Who?

1288
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:18,840
It intrigues you, I see.

1289
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:21,843
No, it's because you mention.

1290
01:26:23,554 --> 01:26:26,639
- I have not offended you?
- Not at all.

1291
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:28,891
Are you sure?

1292
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:34,355
Just a little while.

1293
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:39,151
Sometimes authors
are very likely on their writings.

1294
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:41,863
But I will survive, do not worry.

1295
01:26:42,072 --> 01:26:46,325
The trouble is that you do not do
a clear critique says.

1296
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:49,954
Seems that there is an implied
in what you say.

1297
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:51,747
It's annoying.

1298
01:26:51,957 --> 01:26:57,253
I think that it might be me
you hate, not my articles.

1299
01:26:57,462 --> 01:26:58,379
This is absurd.

1300
01:26:58,589 --> 01:27:00,172
But it's true.

1301
01:27:00,507 --> 01:27:02,800
We must say that we are very different.

1302
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,594
It must be recognized.

1303
01:27:04,803 --> 01:27:07,638
We have differences on everything
on life.

1304
01:27:08,307 --> 01:27:11,309
I guess it is in order
of things.

1305
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:15,187
The older we get,
the more we become fussy, hard.

1306
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:19,692
So, finally,
it is normal that you do not like them.

1307
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:22,653
The opposite would have been amazing.

1308
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:26,949
I might even be rejoicing.

1309
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:27,992
Do you understand?

1310
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:29,619
Finally ...

1311
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:32,622
I do not want to dwell on the subject.

1312
01:27:36,585 --> 01:27:40,838
Amazing how are you always going out
with a pirouette.

1313
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:44,425
A good word to justify yourself, always.

1314
01:27:44,635 --> 01:27:46,969
You can stop, please?

1315
01:27:47,179 --> 01:27:50,264
You had a question to ask
arriving.

1316
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:51,724
It is done.

1317
01:27:51,934 --> 01:27:54,268
What you wanted to know?

1318
01:27:55,479 --> 01:27:59,023
The subject of the article
you just sent.

1319
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,942
No, I do not believe you.

1320
01:28:01,568 --> 01:28:03,069
If that was my question.

1321
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:07,949
Either. Religion, morality ...
nothing that would interest you.

1322
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:09,784
I see.

1323
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:14,163
You found your scapegoat.
You're going to exploit it fully.

1324
01:28:14,373 --> 01:28:16,040
Record peace to this poor guy.

1325
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:17,917
Necla, you start to get irritated.

1326
01:28:18,085 --> 01:28:19,418
Why do you say that?

1327
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:23,297
You what to do with religion,
faith, spirituality?

1328
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:26,467
You have already set foot
in a mosque?

1329
01:28:26,677 --> 01:28:29,053
You have already prayed,
to talk about spirituality?

1330
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:32,223
I have to go to the mosque
to talk about religion?

1331
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:33,474
It's crazy, that!

1332
01:28:33,684 --> 01:28:37,186
You say Mullah stinks feet.
What do you care?

1333
01:28:37,813 --> 01:28:40,982
He made 10 km walk in the cold.

1334
01:28:41,191 --> 01:28:44,193
What it can do
when he gets there?

1335
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:46,862
What do you mean?

1336
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:49,532
You know very well.

1337
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:51,450
No, I do not understand.

1338
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:52,868
Then I'll explain.

1339
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:56,414
I do not think is right
a man talks about spirituality,

1340
01:28:56,581 --> 01:28:59,375
while he never cried
on the grave of his parents,

1341
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:01,669
there has never been the same.

1342
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:04,839
There are ways to cry
you do not know.

1343
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:09,301
OK. So continues.

1344
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:15,016
If only I had
your ability to blindness

1345
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:19,854
I would find a lot of things
newsworthy

1346
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:22,690
who would stand to be
this boredom.

1347
01:29:24,735 --> 01:29:26,277
I do not understand

1348
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:29,739
you do not you tired of rehashing
the same subjects.

1349
01:29:31,283 --> 01:29:34,744
Perseverance

1350
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:39,832
is the only way to deepen a subject,
to create something new.

1351
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:42,918
I do not know
what trouble you speak.

1352
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:47,923
I never had a second
to annoy me.

1353
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:53,345
In this day and age,
the trouble is a sacred luxury.

1354
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:56,599
And before, it was not?

1355
01:29:56,767 --> 01:30:01,604
If agreed. The problem has always
was a luxury. It suits you?

1356
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:07,401
How can we be
at this point the antipodes?

1357
01:30:07,611 --> 01:30:10,112
To believe that we are not brother and sister.

1358
01:30:10,572 --> 01:30:13,699
This is normal. That's how
all siblings.

1359
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:15,284
One is a hard worker, the other lazy.

1360
01:30:15,452 --> 01:30:17,244
One is bright, the other beast.

1361
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:20,122
One is sociable, the other introvert.

1362
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:21,499
It's a fact.

1363
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:23,876
- So what?
- So, this is normal.

1364
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:26,670
I still can not explain

1365
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:30,591
how could I leave Istanbul

1366
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,513
to come and bury me here with you.

1367
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:39,934
I dépéris in this hole.

1368
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:43,771
I feel good,
where I have my room and my books.

1369
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,815
It could be anywhere.

1370
01:30:46,024 --> 01:30:50,653
We know how to create a world in itself,
occupation, or we do not know.

1371
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:55,282
You're bored because you do nothing
of your days.

1372
01:30:55,492 --> 01:30:56,784
You let yourself go.

1373
01:30:56,993 --> 01:30:58,911
It was good when you translating.

1374
01:30:59,121 --> 01:31:00,621
You do not even do it more.

1375
01:31:00,831 --> 01:31:02,164
Obviously, you're bored.

1376
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:04,166
In life, you need a job,
a passion.

1377
01:31:05,043 --> 01:31:09,088
It is said that idleness
is the mother of all vices.

1378
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:14,468
it depends
what is known to work.

1379
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:18,430
I do not think so
it wants to say, stir the air.

1380
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:20,683
What does that mean, then?

1381
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:24,895
When we reflect,
it is very active.

1382
01:31:25,105 --> 01:31:26,397
Even if we do nothing.

1383
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:29,942
So you're busy thinking, right?

1384
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:34,113
Maybe
I do not know what to do.

1385
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:37,283
I have no passions that drive me.

1386
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:39,869
And you, what do you do?

1387
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:45,082
You're wasting your best years
with things that do not concern you.

1388
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:49,336
You did not start to tinker
as an alchemist?

1389
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:56,427
Just to see you, it depresses me.

1390
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:59,388
But what you have, Necla,
damn it?

1391
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:01,891
You've raised the left foot?

1392
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:04,643
The more I take upon myself,
more thou Acharnae.

1393
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:07,104
- Calm down.
- Finally, let's see ...

1394
01:32:07,314 --> 01:32:10,566
I understand why you divorced
after so many years.

1395
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:14,445
No man can bear
such a viper's tongue.

1396
01:32:16,865 --> 01:32:19,033
Birds of a feather flock together.

1397
01:32:19,242 --> 01:32:20,201
How so?

1398
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:24,079
- I understand it.
- You mean that?

1399
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:27,833
Of your half.
You have become the same.

1400
01:32:28,043 --> 01:32:30,669
Now it is the turn of Nihal?

1401
01:32:31,713 --> 01:32:35,174
I know you think that about me.
But I do not care.

1402
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:38,427
This is my opinion.
Nothing like Nihal.

1403
01:32:38,637 --> 01:32:41,889
It lurks in giving tunes
benefactor of angel.

1404
01:32:42,098 --> 01:32:44,266
While she goofs off.

1405
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:47,728
Aside launch contemptuous looks.

1406
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:50,064
It's our fault if you do nothing?

1407
01:32:50,232 --> 01:32:53,442
Go on, do something, too.
Who you back?

1408
01:32:55,445 --> 01:32:59,073
She struts
and call it charity.

1409
01:33:00,450 --> 01:33:04,578
The woman redemption ritual
who has never won his life.

1410
01:33:04,788 --> 01:33:06,205
What redemption is not known.

1411
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:08,582
What do you want her to do?

1412
01:33:08,792 --> 01:33:12,253
Charity, it is not throwing
a bone to a hungry dog,

1413
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:15,673
is to share it with him
when you have so hungry.

1414
01:33:16,258 --> 01:33:20,678
Everyone does what he can in his own way.
Where is the problem?

1415
01:33:20,887 --> 01:33:24,306
Ask yourself what makes you work.

1416
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:27,017
You're not listening to me. What relationship?

1417
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:31,897
You keep digging
where others have already found everything.

1418
01:33:32,107 --> 01:33:35,025
Stop you struggle in vain.

1419
01:33:35,235 --> 01:33:38,195
It is useless.
He shall go out anything new.

1420
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:41,824
Tell me, you,
which would again.

1421
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:44,451
You're the great thinker, not me.

1422
01:33:44,661 --> 01:33:45,828
I will not teach you.

1423
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:49,248
It is the universal interests me.
Even if it's déjà vu.

1424
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:50,332
For once,

1425
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,335
be a little realistic.

1426
01:33:53,837 --> 01:33:55,587
Just this once.

1427
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:57,965
It is you who speak of realism?

1428
01:33:58,174 --> 01:34:01,093
Deal of art and help
spiritual development,

1429
01:34:01,303 --> 01:34:03,220
it's alchemy for you?

1430
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:05,431
Not. That's what I said:

1431
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:09,476
If, you, the thinkers,
you atteliez to more serious problems,

1432
01:34:09,686 --> 01:34:14,273
the little things that haunt you
would resolve themselves.

1433
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:17,526
Taking the height
to observe a city,

1434
01:34:17,736 --> 01:34:20,612
also see the trees
rivers, meadows ...

1435
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:23,991
But no, you hang
a tiny dot,

1436
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,076
laziness and cowardice.

1437
01:34:26,411 --> 01:34:30,122
It turns round again.

1438
01:34:30,332 --> 01:34:33,417
We are not obliged to agree.
Why quarrel?

1439
01:34:33,626 --> 01:34:35,544
You know what your problem is?

1440
01:34:35,712 --> 01:34:37,379
For fear of suffering,

1441
01:34:37,547 --> 01:34:39,882
you like you hide the face.

1442
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:42,051
But, yes, that's it.

1443
01:34:42,552 --> 01:34:46,764
But we must have the courage
to face the truth.

1444
01:34:46,973 --> 01:34:49,641
If you are looking to achieve truth

1445
01:34:49,851 --> 01:34:54,897
sometimes you do not hesitate
to destroy, my dear Aydin.

1446
01:34:55,440 --> 01:35:00,903
But good actor, you forgot the true,
forgot to be yourself.

1447
01:35:02,655 --> 01:35:06,492
You exchange identity like a shirt.

1448
01:35:06,826 --> 01:35:10,037
We must learn to live with you.

1449
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:13,624
You want me to be realistic?
So listen to me.

1450
01:35:13,833 --> 01:35:17,836
You are doomed to loneliness
and boredom for the rest of your life.

1451
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:20,756
Because you're a coward,
because you're lazy.

1452
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:22,383
- Me?
- Yes.

1453
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:26,178
You live like a parasite,
hooks to the other.

1454
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:30,182
The whole world is indebted.
Who knows why.

1455
01:35:30,392 --> 01:35:32,309
- You'll calm down?
- I am calm.

1456
01:35:32,519 --> 01:35:36,146
You think you can say and do
what you want

1457
01:35:36,356 --> 01:35:38,023
and others must accept it.

1458
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:41,693
- How is that possible?
- I do not want that at all.

1459
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,530
Where you come from that?

1460
01:35:44,948 --> 01:35:48,700
Realism? You're totally in
without unknowingly.

1461
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:50,411
- Me?
- Yes.

1462
01:35:50,995 --> 01:35:52,329
It's the best.

1463
01:35:52,956 --> 01:35:56,333
I assure you,
as soon as you walk out that door,

1464
01:35:56,543 --> 01:36:00,754
I pray that you do not spear me
a pike that exasperates me.

1465
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:04,341
When you're sitting behind me,

1466
01:36:04,551 --> 01:36:08,554
I feel your eyes looking
the conflict for boredom.

1467
01:36:09,139 --> 01:36:10,722
My back went numb.

1468
01:36:12,142 --> 01:36:13,600
I have powers that escape me.

1469
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:18,272
As if someone was rubbing my back
his calloused hand.

1470
01:36:18,857 --> 01:36:21,483
It gives me chills,
it prevents me from writing.

1471
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:23,777
What are you talking about?

1472
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:26,655
You are obliged to be always
as brittle?

1473
01:36:28,241 --> 01:36:29,158
You want me, say so.

1474
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:31,577
That's why you're all alone.

1475
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:35,789
Neither husband nor friend, person.
Alone in the world.

1476
01:36:37,167 --> 01:36:38,667
Am I wrong?

1477
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:43,255
Enough realism or I continue?

1478
01:36:43,465 --> 01:36:47,259
This is a very personal realism.
You're right.

1479
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:50,679
Reflection as supreme activity.

1480
01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:54,725
We have heard it all.

1481
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:57,895
The old excuse
cowards and phonies.

1482
01:36:58,104 --> 01:36:59,980
You count thee away with this?

1483
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:04,026
Beautiful tirade.

1484
01:38:14,097 --> 01:38:15,806
Hello.

1485
01:38:16,015 --> 01:38:17,933
- How is it going?
- Good and you?

1486
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:19,768
Well, thank you.

1487
01:38:20,687 --> 01:38:23,021
I would like to pay for the room.

1488
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:24,606
Really?

1489
01:38:24,816 --> 01:38:30,737
Yes, we leave early tomorrow morning.

1490
01:38:31,573 --> 01:38:33,323
Already?

1491
01:38:33,825 --> 01:38:37,119
- OK. Already the start?
- Yes, sorry.

1492
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:40,581
- You will be missed.
- Thank you.

1493
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:43,333
- You have rained here?
- Yes of course.

1494
01:38:43,543 --> 01:38:44,918
Was it good?

1495
01:38:45,128 --> 01:38:48,422
Yes, I was very happy
to stay in this hotel.

1496
01:38:48,631 --> 01:38:50,173
Very nice room.

1497
01:38:50,383 --> 01:38:52,342
The better.

1498
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:58,825
- How are you?
- Hi.

1499
01:39:59,035 --> 01:40:00,661
I did not know you were here.

1500
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:02,704
It was I who invited Suavi.

1501
01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:04,873
I doubt it.

1502
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:07,417
Something we celebrate?

1503
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:10,837
No, it was a meeting.

1504
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:12,673
- A meeting?
- Yes.

1505
01:40:13,675 --> 01:40:16,093
What a mystery!
It is a military council?

1506
01:40:17,387 --> 01:40:19,388
I had not told you? If ...

1507
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:21,056
When it?

1508
01:40:22,809 --> 01:40:25,519
I do not know.
You had answered:"Hmm."

1509
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:28,230
I found strange
it does not interest you.

1510
01:40:28,606 --> 01:40:31,608
I said "Hum"?
I do not remember.

1511
01:40:32,652 --> 01:40:35,821
No matter.
It's not about you anyway.

1512
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:37,572
You knew very well.

1513
01:40:43,329 --> 01:40:44,705
- Nihal?
- Yes?

1514
01:40:44,914 --> 01:40:46,665
You told me where exactly?

1515
01:40:46,874 --> 01:40:48,208
I do not know.

1516
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:53,296
Did you hear?
That does not concern you!

1517
01:40:56,259 --> 01:40:58,260
I take your coat?

1518
01:41:01,097 --> 01:41:02,180
Where is Necla?

1519
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:04,266
In his room.

1520
01:41:05,059 --> 01:41:06,351
Why? She is angry?

1521
01:41:06,561 --> 01:41:09,062
Not. I can go to,
if you want to.

1522
01:41:09,272 --> 01:41:10,772
Not. She came down this morning?

1523
01:41:10,982 --> 01:41:12,816
Surely.

1524
01:41:13,025 --> 01:41:15,068
Why you ask?

1525
01:41:16,112 --> 01:41:17,821
All right, go ahead.

1526
01:41:21,701 --> 01:41:22,784
So what?

1527
01:41:23,286 --> 01:41:25,579
I thought you did not go out.

1528
01:41:25,788 --> 01:41:27,247
But no, I assure you.

1529
01:41:27,457 --> 01:41:30,917
But I could not deny Nihal.

1530
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:37,632
listen

1531
01:41:37,842 --> 01:41:39,968
to watch out not to get fleeced.

1532
01:41:40,178 --> 01:41:42,679
They are insatiable
and you can not say no.

1533
01:41:42,889 --> 01:41:45,599
I look so stupid as that?

1534
01:41:46,058 --> 01:41:48,477
I warn my old friend.

1535
01:41:48,686 --> 01:41:51,396
I would not
have to regret it.

1536
01:41:51,606 --> 01:41:53,648
Can I get a coffee?

1537
01:41:53,858 --> 01:41:55,734
I drink my coffee and I'm off.

1538
01:41:55,943 --> 01:41:57,444
Rest.

1539
01:41:57,612 --> 01:41:59,946
No, not for me.

1540
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:03,575
- Just a little.
- No way.

1541
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,134
- Levent! Between, welcome!
- Hello, friends.

1542
01:42:21,344 --> 01:42:22,969
- How is it going?
- Well, thank you.

1543
01:42:23,179 --> 01:42:24,179
I take your coat.

1544
01:42:24,388 --> 01:42:28,058
Where were you, Mr. instit?
I was leaving.

1545
01:42:28,267 --> 01:42:31,937
I was in the military office.
The wife of the commander was there.

1546
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:32,813
So what?

1547
01:42:33,022 --> 01:42:35,482
In public,
these types pamper their wives.

1548
01:42:35,691 --> 01:42:37,901
But if given the opportunity,

1549
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:42,405
they would put them in bags
and throw them into the water!

1550
01:42:45,034 --> 01:42:47,244
Hello. Aydin, the husband of Nihal.

1551
01:42:47,453 --> 01:42:51,248
Delighted.
I Levent, the teacher.

1552
01:42:51,457 --> 01:42:53,500
- I suspected it.
- Why?

1553
01:42:53,709 --> 01:42:56,378
You often go.
I've heard of you.

1554
01:42:56,587 --> 01:42:59,130
I do not know
what you do ...

1555
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:02,759
Nihal you explain the better,

1556
01:43:02,927 --> 01:43:09,307
but raises funds
to help underprivileged schools.

1557
01:43:09,475 --> 01:43:12,853
Since the arrival of Nihal,
has made enormous progress.

1558
01:43:13,062 --> 01:43:15,772
- Well done, bravo.
- Thank you.

1559
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:18,066
Do not stand, friends.

1560
01:43:18,234 --> 01:43:19,401
I beg you.

1561
01:43:24,657 --> 01:43:27,325
Levent, what you want to drink?

1562
01:43:27,535 --> 01:43:31,997
I will
of your delicious coffee liqueur.

1563
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:34,499
Of course. Someone else will?

1564
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:36,251
Suavi?

1565
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:38,545
Just now, thank you.

1566
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:44,301
And I, a tea, Nihal. Thank you.

1567
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:53,602
So, Bulent,

1568
01:43:53,811 --> 01:43:56,187
there are how many schools
in the area?

1569
01:43:56,397 --> 01:43:58,440
Levent, no Bulent.

1570
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:03,194
Three in the center.

1571
01:44:03,404 --> 01:44:05,030
How many students?

1572
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:08,033
We, we have 75 ...

1573
01:44:08,576 --> 01:44:11,119
150 there ... in total, 250-300.
Why?

1574
01:44:11,329 --> 01:44:14,706
That's it? I would have thought more.

1575
01:44:15,124 --> 01:44:16,917
Look, it's snowing!

1576
01:44:19,462 --> 01:44:22,756
If this continues, it will be hard
mounting the coast.

1577
01:44:22,924 --> 01:44:23,882
Aydin!

1578
01:44:25,426 --> 01:44:29,054
Can you come? There is a lamp
does not work in the kitchen.

1579
01:44:29,972 --> 01:44:31,389
I'm coming.

1580
01:44:41,442 --> 01:44:44,235
Which one? That?

1581
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:48,156
Forgiveness.
I said that to make you come.

1582
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:52,285
Do not get me wrong,

1583
01:44:52,495 --> 01:44:55,747
but it's supposed to be
a private meeting.

1584
01:44:56,999 --> 01:44:58,041
So what?

1585
01:44:58,918 --> 01:45:02,963
It should enable us
to arrive

1586
01:45:03,464 --> 01:45:06,633
the efforts together
for months.

1587
01:45:08,219 --> 01:45:09,260
So what?

1588
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:13,098
You can leave us?

1589
01:45:14,475 --> 01:45:16,184
Talk about what you want.

1590
01:45:16,811 --> 01:45:18,728
You have something to hide?

1591
01:45:18,938 --> 01:45:21,106
That's not the issue.

1592
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:26,152
You do not realize
it is disrespectful?

1593
01:45:26,362 --> 01:45:28,029
Why disrespectful?

1594
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:31,491
I simply say
this is a private meeting.

1595
01:45:31,701 --> 01:45:34,244
You have to see it to believe it.

1596
01:45:34,453 --> 01:45:36,663
You're surrounded by men
and you vires your husband.

1597
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:38,456
Do not be ridiculous.

1598
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:42,335
There are women in the room.
And others are coming.

1599
01:45:42,545 --> 01:45:46,214
But when you're here,
it complicates things, that's all.

1600
01:45:46,424 --> 01:45:48,466
You meddle in everything.

1601
01:45:49,427 --> 01:45:52,679
Let us make our way.

1602
01:45:53,723 --> 01:45:57,809
If I organized a meeting of this kind
and you came to it,

1603
01:45:58,019 --> 01:46:01,104
I would never have
so rude with you.

1604
01:46:02,273 --> 01:46:04,315
I do not understand you.

1605
01:46:04,900 --> 01:46:06,985
I do not understand these things.

1606
01:46:07,194 --> 01:46:09,154
It's been a year since we work.

1607
01:46:09,363 --> 01:46:13,867
You never showed the slightest interest
and in the end you arrive.

1608
01:46:14,076 --> 01:46:16,161
I do not understand what you seek.

1609
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:17,787
I seek nothing.

1610
01:46:29,175 --> 01:46:32,177
I would have soon felt
and I would be out of myself.

1611
01:46:33,429 --> 01:46:36,556
What makes me angry,
it's your aplomb.

1612
01:46:37,141 --> 01:46:38,975
You dare tell me that.

1613
01:46:39,185 --> 01:46:41,561
I did not say in front of people.

1614
01:46:41,771 --> 01:46:45,273
I ask you here nicely.

1615
01:46:46,108 --> 01:46:47,358
What more?

1616
01:46:47,568 --> 01:46:48,985
I do not know.

1617
01:46:49,612 --> 01:46:52,822
But I know that I,
I never would've done that.

1618
01:46:53,532 --> 01:46:55,200
I'm sure.

1619
01:46:56,660 --> 01:46:59,079
The same old scenes
that repeat.

1620
01:46:59,622 --> 01:47:01,873
I do not want it.

1621
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:05,627
OK.

1622
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:07,754
Do what you want.

1623
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:10,632
I go, you can stay.

1624
01:48:14,071 --> 01:48:15,530
So what?

1625
01:48:18,784 --> 01:48:21,202
- I'm leaving.
- Already?

1626
01:48:21,412 --> 01:48:23,580
Go for It.

1627
01:48:23,789 --> 01:48:26,499
There may be black ice,
it's dangerous.

1628
01:48:26,709 --> 01:48:28,459
It's okay.

1629
01:48:28,919 --> 01:48:30,503
You have to live dangerously.

1630
01:48:31,505 --> 01:48:32,714
Class ...

1631
01:48:33,799 --> 01:48:36,676
- Where are you going?
- We'll see.

1632
01:48:37,428 --> 01:48:39,220
Where the road will lead me.

1633
01:48:40,389 --> 01:48:42,015
Hidayat was down?

1634
01:48:42,808 --> 01:48:45,894
- Yes, I have checked out.
- I do not say that for that.

1635
01:48:46,729 --> 01:48:49,314
You need anything?
A snack?

1636
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:50,815
No, thank you.

1637
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:54,360
Well ...

1638
01:48:55,070 --> 01:48:56,196
That's it.

1639
01:48:58,908 --> 01:49:01,910
- Good road.
- Thank you.

1640
01:49:02,119 --> 01:49:03,203
Do not forget us.

1641
01:49:26,352 --> 01:49:28,686
Nihal, I mind?

1642
01:49:30,981 --> 01:49:32,649
No need to hide things,

1643
01:49:32,858 --> 01:49:34,817
I have just one question.

1644
01:49:35,027 --> 01:49:35,985
I'm listening.

1645
01:49:38,948 --> 01:49:41,658
I was told that there had been
a fundraiser yesterday.

1646
01:49:42,743 --> 01:49:44,035
Really?

1647
01:49:44,245 --> 01:49:46,871
Yes. So what?

1648
01:49:47,915 --> 01:49:49,832
Why you did not tell me?

1649
01:49:50,542 --> 01:49:51,834
I should do it?

1650
01:49:55,756 --> 01:49:59,092
You did not have to,
but it would have been nice.

1651
01:49:59,301 --> 01:50:02,345
Maybe I wanted to do
a large donation.

1652
01:50:02,721 --> 01:50:05,181
I do not think so
this is a good idea.

1653
01:50:06,767 --> 01:50:08,768
Everything is going well.

1654
01:50:08,978 --> 01:50:10,353
We do not need you, thank you.

1655
01:50:10,562 --> 01:50:12,230
But let's see ...

1656
01:50:13,315 --> 01:50:15,233
we still need ...

1657
01:50:16,777 --> 01:50:18,569
I am a rich man, after all.

1658
01:50:18,737 --> 01:50:22,240
What more natural than to support
an educational project?

1659
01:50:23,158 --> 01:50:25,326
We asked you to do anything.

1660
01:50:25,494 --> 01:50:28,496
But neither are you, darling.

1661
01:50:28,706 --> 01:50:32,583
And yet, you have created an entire committee
home without telling me.

1662
01:50:32,793 --> 01:50:33,668
Right?

1663
01:50:34,128 --> 01:50:35,920
Listen, Aydin, please.

1664
01:50:36,797 --> 01:50:38,715
We live in peace for two years,

1665
01:50:38,924 --> 01:50:41,134
without regard to each other.

1666
01:50:41,343 --> 01:50:42,969
Why the sudden change?

1667
01:50:44,638 --> 01:50:48,850
Yesterday you wanted to humiliate us,
my guests and me.

1668
01:50:49,351 --> 01:50:51,769
- I saw.
- Who, me?

1669
01:50:51,979 --> 01:50:53,438
Not on your life.

1670
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:55,106
C'mon ...

1671
01:50:55,316 --> 01:50:57,859
I have not slept all night.

1672
01:50:59,278 --> 01:51:03,364
If our disputes of the past
were to resume,

1673
01:51:03,574 --> 01:51:05,867
I could not stay, know it.

1674
01:51:21,717 --> 01:51:24,802
- Is that a threat?
- Why I would threaten you?

1675
01:51:25,554 --> 01:51:27,305
I warn you, that's all.

1676
01:51:30,225 --> 01:51:32,143
Okay, you go.

1677
01:51:32,686 --> 01:51:33,978
Where would you go?

1678
01:51:34,188 --> 01:51:36,606
When I can, I do not know.

1679
01:51:36,815 --> 01:51:37,940
I will go to Istanbul.

1680
01:51:38,150 --> 01:51:40,902
I will find a job, I will work.

1681
01:51:46,283 --> 01:51:47,950
My little Nihal ...

1682
01:51:49,912 --> 01:51:53,790
You did not start rehashing
the same, since the time?

1683
01:51:55,125 --> 01:51:57,460
As if I was holding.

1684
01:51:59,963 --> 01:52:02,590
I have prevented you from leaving?

1685
01:52:03,133 --> 01:52:06,969
Pars anytime. You should try it.

1686
01:52:07,513 --> 01:52:09,597
A job at minimum wage.

1687
01:52:10,307 --> 01:52:12,100
8 am to 18 pm.

1688
01:52:12,935 --> 01:52:16,854
You'll see if you remain time
and energy to save the world.

1689
01:52:17,398 --> 01:52:18,981
I will do it if necessary.

1690
01:52:20,359 --> 01:52:22,568
It's better than wasting my life

1691
01:52:22,778 --> 01:52:25,405
and being the parasite
an arrogant man.

1692
01:52:26,865 --> 01:52:29,575
Thanks to you, my life is completely empty.

1693
01:52:30,244 --> 01:52:33,413
I live in your hooks,
I spend your money.

1694
01:52:33,622 --> 01:52:37,750
But that's the price of my freedom
and my useless fidelity.

1695
01:52:38,419 --> 01:52:42,588
You know what it feels like
can give the money to the other?

1696
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:43,756
No, I do not know.

1697
01:52:44,716 --> 01:52:45,716
You know why?

1698
01:52:45,926 --> 01:52:49,387
Because I have always toiled
not to know it.

1699
01:52:51,265 --> 01:52:53,850
I had no childhood or youth.

1700
01:52:58,272 --> 01:53:01,190
A life too easy,
that's your problem.

1701
01:53:02,651 --> 01:53:05,153
Gratitude, it is unknown to you.

1702
01:53:18,834 --> 01:53:20,835
I ask you ...

1703
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:26,257
to stop these secret meetings
in my house.

1704
01:53:27,551 --> 01:53:30,678
I only get close to my home.

1705
01:53:32,097 --> 01:53:36,476
These scoundrels go to
their charity elsewhere.

1706
01:53:38,187 --> 01:53:42,190
Nobody will grow
at night cheers at home.

1707
01:53:42,399 --> 01:53:44,025
I will not allow it.

1708
01:53:48,363 --> 01:53:51,324
This asshole instit did nothing to make.

1709
01:53:51,783 --> 01:53:54,327
The school needs this, that ...

1710
01:53:55,454 --> 01:54:00,249
It only seeks to trap neurotic
bad business, in your genre.

1711
01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:50,216
Why do not you understand me?

1712
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:55,638
Why are you unfair?

1713
01:54:57,558 --> 01:55:01,519
I swear that my only goal,
coming yesterday

1714
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:04,647
was to help you, to support you.

1715
01:55:04,856 --> 01:55:07,858
Aydin, leave me, I beg you.

1716
01:55:08,402 --> 01:55:12,029
It takes a bit of distance.
Either you go or I go.

1717
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:14,323
Or we part, I do not know.

1718
01:55:16,118 --> 01:55:18,160
OK. No need to shout.

1719
01:55:19,746 --> 01:55:21,497
I'm leaving anyway.

1720
01:55:22,541 --> 01:55:24,625
It is long since decided.

1721
01:55:26,295 --> 01:55:28,087
I'll stay a little in Istanbul.

1722
01:55:29,673 --> 01:55:32,300
I have things to do there
for my book.

1723
01:55:33,051 --> 01:55:36,095
But your fundraising care.

1724
01:55:37,097 --> 01:55:38,681
This is very serious.

1725
01:55:38,890 --> 01:55:40,558
First I have to fix that.

1726
01:55:41,518 --> 01:55:43,811
So please, come sit.

1727
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:47,189
We'll talk
like civilized people.

1728
01:55:47,733 --> 01:55:49,233
Come on.

1729
01:56:02,748 --> 01:56:05,875
Nihal, I ask you kindly
come sit down.

1730
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:09,587
Come on.

1731
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:19,472
Nihal, come here, dammit!

1732
01:57:03,684 --> 01:57:06,268
Nihal, darling ...

1733
01:57:09,106 --> 01:57:12,358
It is obvious that you assembled this group

1734
01:57:12,567 --> 01:57:15,111
because you love people

1735
01:57:15,821 --> 01:57:18,489
and that you are conscientious.

1736
01:57:18,699 --> 01:57:20,783
I see no conspiracy.

1737
01:57:20,992 --> 01:57:23,661
I will support you all the way.

1738
01:57:25,580 --> 01:57:29,875
I respect your intelligence
and your heart.

1739
01:57:30,085 --> 01:57:32,002
Especially your heart.

1740
01:57:33,338 --> 01:57:37,550
But I can not let
a sensitive operation,

1741
01:57:37,759 --> 01:57:41,220
which could cause us
unpredictable disaster,

1742
01:57:41,430 --> 01:57:45,558
be completed by you and these vultures.

1743
01:57:47,269 --> 01:57:49,228
Despite all your good intentions.

1744
01:57:50,063 --> 01:57:54,400
Hell is paved with good intentions.

1745
01:57:56,862 --> 01:57:59,238
First, you lack experience.

1746
01:57:59,990 --> 01:58:01,615
You know nothing of life.

1747
01:58:01,825 --> 01:58:03,576
You packed you.

1748
01:58:03,785 --> 01:58:05,703
You let yourself be fooled.

1749
01:58:06,288 --> 01:58:08,497
You do everything on trust.

1750
01:58:09,875 --> 01:58:13,252
You've surrounded
all these improbable acolytes.

1751
01:58:14,254 --> 01:58:16,547
It's a slippery slope, Nihal.

1752
01:58:17,382 --> 01:58:20,468
You want me to tell you frankly?

1753
01:58:21,178 --> 01:58:25,347
There are two traps
you have no way to avoid.

1754
01:58:25,932 --> 01:58:30,519
First, nothing will happen
in schools.

1755
01:58:30,729 --> 01:58:35,065
And then you will lose lots of money
because you do not know how.

1756
01:58:35,275 --> 01:58:36,984
Your name will be soiled.

1757
01:58:37,194 --> 01:58:39,904
The money, you tell me,
it's nothing, I could pay.

1758
01:58:40,113 --> 01:58:43,032
But if your name, our name was dirty?

1759
01:58:43,617 --> 01:58:45,993
Once that happens,

1760
01:58:46,203 --> 01:58:49,288
nothing we can do against gossip.

1761
01:58:49,498 --> 01:58:53,292
They will accuse us
of pocketing donations.

1762
01:58:53,502 --> 01:58:55,503
And there, you'll find yourself alone.

1763
01:58:55,712 --> 01:58:57,171
Gone, friends.

1764
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:58,672
It will fall on us.

1765
01:58:58,882 --> 01:59:00,883
Where are you getting at?

1766
01:59:02,052 --> 01:59:03,427
So I tell you this:

1767
01:59:03,637 --> 01:59:06,055
This is fine,
your fundraiser.

1768
01:59:06,264 --> 01:59:08,557
But frankly, it worries me a little.

1769
01:59:09,226 --> 01:59:12,812
These things are not made
with the ardor of lovers.

1770
01:59:13,814 --> 01:59:16,607
That's why
I felt obliged to intervene

1771
01:59:16,817 --> 01:59:20,027
to avoid problems in the future.

1772
01:59:20,487 --> 01:59:22,822
- The obligation?
- Yes.

1773
01:59:23,865 --> 01:59:28,619
I was leaving for Istanbul
but first I have to take care of it.

1774
01:59:29,204 --> 01:59:32,498
This is serious, these issues.
This is not child's play.

1775
01:59:33,333 --> 01:59:36,836
There was so much business
scam recently.

1776
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:39,964
You know the new legislation?

1777
01:59:40,173 --> 01:59:42,424
Do not beat around the bush.
What do you want?

1778
01:59:42,968 --> 01:59:46,470
See the list of donations and expenditures.

1779
01:59:47,889 --> 01:59:51,976
And the names of your acolytes.

1780
01:59:52,185 --> 01:59:56,480
I'm sure they are reliable,
but one is never too careful.

1781
01:59:57,107 --> 01:59:59,066
Are you serious here?

1782
01:59:59,276 --> 02:00:03,237
Nihal, let's be reasonable,
please.

1783
02:00:03,446 --> 02:00:06,782
You do not trust my experience
and honesty?

1784
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:11,370
I do not understand what you seek.

1785
02:00:11,746 --> 02:00:14,081
What could I look?

1786
02:00:14,666 --> 02:00:16,750
What interest would I?

1787
02:00:17,919 --> 02:00:21,213
I'm just trying to avoid trouble
to our family.

1788
02:00:21,423 --> 02:00:23,007
It is my right, right?

1789
02:00:27,429 --> 02:00:28,429
Come on,

1790
02:00:31,641 --> 02:00:34,852
show me the list
donations and expenditures,

1791
02:00:35,061 --> 02:00:38,147
I see immediately
if there is a problem.

1792
02:00:38,940 --> 02:00:41,609
I want to see where you are.

1793
02:00:41,818 --> 02:00:44,904
I have nothing to hide from anyone.

1794
02:00:45,113 --> 02:00:46,822
Everything is there, will see.

1795
02:00:51,453 --> 02:00:52,870
That there?

1796
02:01:12,223 --> 02:01:15,559
pardon,
but I can not find my way there.

1797
02:01:16,353 --> 02:01:19,104
You do not have a picture of donations?

1798
02:01:19,481 --> 02:01:21,774
There are all signed documents.

1799
02:01:25,445 --> 02:01:28,197
Nihal, darling ...

1800
02:01:28,990 --> 02:01:31,784
you have no idea what you're doing.

1801
02:01:31,993 --> 02:01:34,453
How is that possible?

1802
02:01:35,580 --> 02:01:40,084
You do not have
a summary table?

1803
02:01:44,506 --> 02:01:48,634
We must keep copies
receipts to donors.

1804
02:01:48,843 --> 02:01:50,010
You have them?

1805
02:01:50,637 --> 02:01:51,595
Not.

1806
02:01:53,264 --> 02:01:57,393
For donations of money or property,

1807
02:01:57,602 --> 02:02:01,146
must systematically invoice
or receipt.

1808
02:02:01,356 --> 02:02:03,107
You have established them?

1809
02:02:03,316 --> 02:02:04,817
Either.

1810
02:02:05,944 --> 02:02:07,611
But it's very important.

1811
02:02:08,196 --> 02:02:09,446
Very important.

1812
02:02:10,991 --> 02:02:15,536
And if they want to deduct the donation
their taxes?

1813
02:02:17,747 --> 02:02:20,207
If one of them the tax fraud?

1814
02:02:20,417 --> 02:02:23,293
It will fall on you
and you'll end up in prison.

1815
02:02:23,503 --> 02:02:29,008
Sorry, but these details
are crucial.

1816
02:02:30,093 --> 02:02:34,263
Receipts must be numbered
and listed separately.

1817
02:02:34,472 --> 02:02:35,931
You did?

1818
02:02:36,391 --> 02:02:37,683
I do not believe.

1819
02:02:38,852 --> 02:02:42,021
I'll take it all supported.

1820
02:02:43,648 --> 02:02:44,815
Go.

1821
02:02:45,358 --> 02:02:46,608
Do what you want.

1822
02:02:49,279 --> 02:02:50,404
OK.

1823
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:54,116
I'll tell you what we'll do.

1824
02:02:55,201 --> 02:03:00,497
I take it all with me
in my office.

1825
02:03:00,707 --> 02:03:04,793
I have the right software
to check everything.

1826
02:03:05,295 --> 02:03:09,339
When I have peeled, I tell you.
OK?

1827
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:14,136
That part of it?

1828
02:03:17,223 --> 02:03:18,265
Good.

1829
02:03:20,685 --> 02:03:24,229
You sure that's it?
If there is anything else, I am too.

1830
02:03:24,981 --> 02:03:25,898
Take.

1831
02:03:28,234 --> 02:03:30,277
Take everything. Let nothing.

1832
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:34,448
That's all I had left in life.
Take it to me.

1833
02:03:35,492 --> 02:03:37,242
Take me everything.

1834
02:03:38,036 --> 02:03:41,163
But what happens to you, Nihal?

1835
02:03:41,372 --> 02:03:42,372
Go ahead, help yourself!

1836
02:03:44,209 --> 02:03:46,543
Everything is for you, take it!

1837
02:03:47,045 --> 02:03:48,629
Do not forget that.

1838
02:03:51,633 --> 02:03:52,382
Look!

1839
02:03:52,592 --> 02:03:54,843
- Take all.
- What are you doing?

1840
02:04:18,243 --> 02:04:20,911
Nihal, darling ...

1841
02:04:23,331 --> 02:04:25,999
You act like a child.

1842
02:04:26,543 --> 02:04:28,043
I do not know what to say.

1843
02:04:29,003 --> 02:04:31,797
When you know the importance of it,

1844
02:04:32,006 --> 02:04:34,216
you come to thank me.

1845
02:04:35,844 --> 02:04:37,344
You'll see.

1846
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:31,273
Nihal, listen ...

1847
02:05:32,275 --> 02:05:34,943
I bring you all that.

1848
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:37,863
I have not really looked.

1849
02:05:38,823 --> 02:05:40,908
A Change of Mind.

1850
02:05:41,910 --> 02:05:45,162
I'm not going to interfere in that.

1851
02:05:48,249 --> 02:05:51,168
To be honest, I'm too lazy.

1852
02:05:51,377 --> 02:05:55,339
I'm pretty busy like that.
So do as you see fit.

1853
02:05:58,843 --> 02:06:02,846
In fact, I'm leaving tomorrow.
It's decided.

1854
02:06:03,932 --> 02:06:06,016
At least until the end of winter.

1855
02:06:06,559 --> 02:06:10,062
The hotel is quiet. Hidayat is there.

1856
02:06:11,231 --> 02:06:13,106
I leave tomorrow in Istanbul.

1857
02:06:20,865 --> 02:06:22,532
Nihal, stop, finally!

1858
02:06:23,576 --> 02:06:25,744
I'm leaving. What do you want more?

1859
02:06:28,414 --> 02:06:31,124
Thank you. Your altruism moves me to tears.

1860
02:06:56,317 --> 02:06:57,818
Remember?

1861
02:06:59,696 --> 02:07:01,530
One day you told me

1862
02:07:02,031 --> 02:07:05,534
that if I changed some things
home,

1863
02:07:07,078 --> 02:07:09,204
you forgive me.

1864
02:07:09,414 --> 02:07:10,622
Remember?

1865
02:07:12,709 --> 02:07:14,209
It means that, for you,

1866
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:18,130
I have a fault to make me forgive.

1867
02:07:22,427 --> 02:07:24,011
So I would like

1868
02:07:25,763 --> 02:07:29,641
in few words and quietly,

1869
02:07:30,435 --> 02:07:33,186
in a way that I can understand,

1870
02:07:33,396 --> 02:07:35,355
Finally, you tell me

1871
02:07:35,565 --> 02:07:37,190
what is my fault.

1872
02:07:46,492 --> 02:07:49,036
I'm too tired to talk.

1873
02:07:49,620 --> 02:07:51,038
Maybe later.

1874
02:07:54,334 --> 02:07:56,335
What kind of mistake?

1875
02:07:58,629 --> 02:08:00,088
What I did to you?

1876
02:08:02,342 --> 02:08:05,886
You tell me, you're young and beautiful,
you want to live your life.

1877
02:08:06,429 --> 02:08:10,098
I'm older
and you hate me for that.

1878
02:08:11,184 --> 02:08:12,225
That's my fault?

1879
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:17,481
I have not forced you to marry me.

1880
02:08:19,776 --> 02:08:21,943
I never restricts your freedom.

1881
02:08:23,196 --> 02:08:27,074
You lead your independent life,
on your side of the house.

1882
02:08:28,576 --> 02:08:31,995
You even built this large committee here.

1883
02:08:34,624 --> 02:08:37,250
If you still want more freedom,
take it.

1884
02:08:37,460 --> 02:08:39,086
I do not hold back.

1885
02:08:39,837 --> 02:08:40,879
Seriously.

1886
02:08:42,507 --> 02:08:45,634
If you want a divorce,
I will not stop you.

1887
02:08:59,315 --> 02:09:01,191
I do not want any of that.

1888
02:09:03,194 --> 02:09:05,612
Of course I wanted to marry you.

1889
02:09:08,116 --> 02:09:10,951
Is not your fault
being older than me.

1890
02:09:11,160 --> 02:09:14,246
I do not want to be free
to love another.

1891
02:09:16,874 --> 02:09:20,210
I have always felt
older than you.

1892
02:09:23,631 --> 02:09:25,924
But you're an insufferable man.

1893
02:09:27,135 --> 02:09:30,178
You're selfish, dismissive, cynical.

1894
02:09:31,806 --> 02:09:33,265
That's your fault.

1895
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:40,814
It's possible.
That may be true, I do not know.

1896
02:09:42,024 --> 02:09:46,528
But at least, I sometimes
to recognize my mistakes.

1897
02:09:47,989 --> 02:09:51,533
But I have never seen you
admit any harm.

1898
02:09:51,742 --> 02:09:52,617
Am I wrong?

1899
02:09:52,827 --> 02:09:55,662
If you intend to overwhelm me
all night

1900
02:09:55,872 --> 02:09:58,748
know that I have no strength
to answer.

1901
02:09:58,958 --> 02:10:01,126
I do not want to overwhelm you.

1902
02:10:01,878 --> 02:10:03,962
But I repeat my question.

1903
02:10:04,172 --> 02:10:06,381
I want to know.

1904
02:10:07,550 --> 02:10:09,301
What is my fault?

1905
02:10:11,637 --> 02:10:13,472
What kind of mistake?

1906
02:10:14,265 --> 02:10:16,016
What I did to you?

1907
02:10:18,436 --> 02:10:19,603
I agree

1908
02:10:22,315 --> 02:10:24,691
you're a grown man,

1909
02:10:25,401 --> 02:10:26,526
honest,

1910
02:10:27,111 --> 02:10:29,529
fair, honest ...

1911
02:10:30,490 --> 02:10:34,326
Overall, it's true.
I can not say anything against that.

1912
02:10:36,412 --> 02:10:39,623
But sometimes you use these qualities
to stifle others

1913
02:10:39,874 --> 02:10:42,834
belittle,
humiliate, crush them.

1914
02:10:44,962 --> 02:10:48,548
Your great moral serves you
to hate the world.

1915
02:10:50,092 --> 02:10:52,052
You hate believers

1916
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:56,681
because for you, believe is a sign
archaic and ignorance.

1917
02:10:57,558 --> 02:11:02,395
You hate unbelievers
because they have neither faith nor ideal.

1918
02:11:04,482 --> 02:11:06,316
The old reactionary seem to you,

1919
02:11:06,859 --> 02:11:10,362
limited, unable to think freely.

1920
02:11:11,447 --> 02:11:14,157
Young people have for you
too free thinking

1921
02:11:14,992 --> 02:11:17,494
and are iconoclasts.

1922
02:11:19,121 --> 02:11:22,874
You sermons constantly the general interest,

1923
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:29,339
but you suspect everyone
being a bandit

1924
02:11:29,632 --> 02:11:31,424
and so you hate the people.

1925
02:11:33,094 --> 02:11:35,095
Which find favor in your eyes?

1926
02:11:37,223 --> 02:11:38,598
If only for once,

1927
02:11:39,725 --> 02:11:43,520
you could defend a position
makes you uncomfortable or

1928
02:11:43,729 --> 02:11:48,149
or a sense
that do not flatter yourself.

1929
02:11:51,612 --> 02:11:53,113
It is not possible.

1930
02:12:02,748 --> 02:12:06,126
You always knew prevent
our separation.

1931
02:12:09,463 --> 02:12:11,715
I guess it suited me.

1932
02:12:13,217 --> 02:12:15,093
I was too young to leave.

1933
02:12:17,054 --> 02:12:19,389
I had neither the courage nor in money.

1934
02:12:20,349 --> 02:12:22,601
Or a better place to go.

1935
02:12:25,563 --> 02:12:28,523
But you,
you've never been remorseful

1936
02:12:28,733 --> 02:12:32,152
proud to see a young woman
in good health,

1937
02:12:32,737 --> 02:12:34,529
dissolve

1938
02:12:34,989 --> 02:12:39,409
in emptiness, boredom and fear?

1939
02:12:42,038 --> 02:12:44,122
The early years, I was afraid.

1940
02:12:45,458 --> 02:12:47,584
Now I am ashamed.

1941
02:12:52,131 --> 02:12:54,382
I wasted my best years.

1942
02:12:55,217 --> 02:12:58,845
I lost all my qualities
in my fight against you.

1943
02:13:01,015 --> 02:13:04,976
I became hard, harsh,
timid, suspicious.

1944
02:13:09,565 --> 02:13:11,483
I do not know what to say.

1945
02:13:14,403 --> 02:13:17,656
I do not know if I can
express anything.

1946
02:13:23,871 --> 02:13:26,748
Our paths have separated,
under one roof.

1947
02:13:28,042 --> 02:13:29,959
Hit the Trail.

1948
02:13:38,969 --> 02:13:42,097
We could have a better life.

1949
02:13:45,059 --> 02:13:46,810
It's too late.

1950
02:13:51,190 --> 02:13:53,191
You can not understand.

1951
02:13:53,401 --> 02:13:57,821
You have to have grown up, like me,
in a village without electricity

1952
02:13:59,573 --> 02:14:02,367
to enjoy the happiness

1953
02:14:02,952 --> 02:14:06,246
to be in a nice cozy
as the latter,

1954
02:14:06,664 --> 02:14:08,164
to listen to the voice of his wife,

1955
02:14:08,374 --> 02:14:12,877
even if it is to agree
scream of horror.

1956
02:14:18,467 --> 02:14:20,802
We had a lackluster youth.

1957
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:25,140
We have not learned to be happy.

1958
02:14:26,100 --> 02:14:28,601
Or to make them happy, apparently.

1959
02:14:31,439 --> 02:14:33,022
But as I said,

1960
02:14:33,607 --> 02:14:35,525
we were not malicious.

1961
02:14:37,194 --> 02:14:41,448
Our intentions were good,
our innocent and pure dreams.

1962
02:14:43,492 --> 02:14:45,493
We just wanted a better world.

1963
02:14:45,703 --> 02:14:47,620
Pardon me, but I do believe you anymore.

1964
02:14:48,247 --> 02:14:50,832
I know this speech.
You're not on stage.

1965
02:14:52,334 --> 02:14:54,627
Everyone has good intentions.

1966
02:14:55,087 --> 02:14:59,674
But as you say,
Hell is paved.

1967
02:15:00,050 --> 02:15:02,302
All this is gibberish.

1968
02:15:02,511 --> 02:15:05,388
I can not hear
your romantic spiel.

1969
02:15:06,807 --> 02:15:09,184
Whenever you come away,

1970
02:15:09,393 --> 02:15:14,397
I know you offal your last card.

1971
02:15:16,192 --> 02:15:20,069
But I do not know
what you want from me, basically.

1972
02:15:20,863 --> 02:15:22,489
Anyway,

1973
02:15:23,073 --> 02:15:25,116
I ask it again:

1974
02:15:26,744 --> 02:15:28,745
Even if you see this activity

1975
02:15:28,954 --> 02:15:32,165
as a lure or a female fad,

1976
02:15:33,125 --> 02:15:34,959
leave me peace.

1977
02:15:36,086 --> 02:15:39,005
Because I do not have
other consolation.

1978
02:15:43,886 --> 02:15:46,429
I spent my youth
to fight against you.

1979
02:15:47,264 --> 02:15:51,851
Through this work,
I have my confidence back.

1980
02:15:52,937 --> 02:15:56,189
I found a meaning
the dreary existence that I have here.

1981
02:15:56,732 --> 02:15:59,484
A goal which I am very proud.

1982
02:16:01,445 --> 02:16:03,530
So let me that.

1983
02:16:06,575 --> 02:16:08,034
Nihal, darling ...

1984
02:16:09,453 --> 02:16:11,871
You are a generous woman,

1985
02:16:12,081 --> 02:16:15,291
fine, rational.

1986
02:16:16,627 --> 02:16:19,796
Everything you say sounds very sensible.

1987
02:16:20,005 --> 02:16:21,548
Really.

1988
02:16:23,676 --> 02:16:24,676
More ...

1989
02:16:25,803 --> 02:16:29,097
idealise a man into a god

1990
02:16:29,598 --> 02:16:32,267
to then blame him

1991
02:16:32,476 --> 02:16:34,811
not to be a god,

1992
02:16:36,647 --> 02:16:38,314
Is not it unfair?

1993
02:16:46,073 --> 02:16:51,286
I wanted to be this great actor
Charismatic you dreamed.

1994
02:16:52,413 --> 02:16:53,872
But I'm not.

1995
02:16:55,541 --> 02:16:57,166
I am a simple man.

1996
02:16:59,503 --> 02:17:02,422
The worst part is that I intend to remain so.

1997
02:17:06,343 --> 02:17:07,969
Let ...

1998
02:17:08,178 --> 02:17:10,054
I am leaving in the morning.

1999
02:17:10,764 --> 02:17:13,391
I will come back in the spring,
do not worry.

2000
02:17:15,394 --> 02:17:16,811
But before leaving,

2001
02:17:18,522 --> 02:17:21,357
I want your list to make a donation.

2002
02:17:22,026 --> 02:17:25,278
Go ahead, I do not care.

2003
02:17:26,113 --> 02:17:28,781
The list is there, write what you want.

2004
02:18:06,862 --> 02:18:09,030
I made an anonymous donation.

2005
02:18:13,994 --> 02:18:15,703
I leave the money there.

2006
02:18:16,705 --> 02:18:17,872
OK?

2007
02:18:23,462 --> 02:18:25,922
Nihal, I hope all will be well.

2008
02:18:27,967 --> 02:18:29,968
Do as you wish.

2009
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:34,931
Do not forget that I'm here,
if necessary.

2010
02:18:38,644 --> 02:18:41,437
But beware of the teacher.

2011
02:18:42,189 --> 02:18:45,400
It seems sneaky and manipulative.

2012
02:18:45,609 --> 02:18:47,986
I feel by far those.

2013
02:18:49,363 --> 02:18:52,156
I advise you to surround yourself with people

2014
02:18:52,366 --> 02:18:55,994
with a conscience, principles,
a moral sense.

2015
02:18:57,371 --> 02:18:59,831
One day you will understand me.

2016
02:19:03,544 --> 02:19:05,211
Conscience, morality,

2017
02:19:06,213 --> 02:19:08,381
ideals, principles ...

2018
02:19:08,590 --> 02:19:10,508
The purpose of life.

2019
02:19:11,093 --> 02:19:13,553
You have those words in his mouth.

2020
02:19:15,222 --> 02:19:18,474
You are abusing and uses in
to hurt and humiliate people,

2021
02:19:18,684 --> 02:19:20,893
to denigrate.

2022
02:19:22,896 --> 02:19:24,313
personally,

2023
02:19:24,732 --> 02:19:28,359
I think someone
pounding these words

2024
02:19:29,486 --> 02:19:31,112
is inevitably suspect.

2025
02:19:50,215 --> 02:19:51,883
I'm tired.

2026
02:19:53,218 --> 02:19:55,803
I want to sleep, if you allow.

2027
02:20:12,446 --> 02:20:13,696
Necla?

2028
02:22:01,722 --> 02:22:02,763
Come on.

2029
02:23:13,543 --> 02:23:16,212
We should call to be safe, right?

2030
02:23:17,547 --> 02:23:18,673
It's already done.

2031
02:23:18,882 --> 02:23:21,509
Flights are canceled,
but the trains.

2032
02:23:22,261 --> 02:23:23,427
Are you sure?

2033
02:23:23,637 --> 02:23:25,554
Yes, I have to have them.

2034
02:23:25,764 --> 02:23:27,807
Trains run smoothly.

2035
02:23:28,016 --> 02:23:29,600
Not to worry.

2036
02:23:31,687 --> 02:23:32,937
OK.

2037
02:23:34,064 --> 02:23:35,690
Let's go.

2038
02:24:37,836 --> 02:24:39,337
Hello.

2039
02:24:41,673 --> 02:24:45,593
The train to Istanbul circulates
Is not it?

2040
02:24:45,802 --> 02:24:47,720
Yes, it happens.

2041
02:24:47,929 --> 02:24:49,221
No delay?

2042
02:24:49,431 --> 02:24:51,557
If, of course,
half an hour to one hour.

2043
02:24:51,767 --> 02:24:54,268
- Half an hour, an hour late?
- That's it.

2044
02:24:54,478 --> 02:24:57,521
- Sure it happens?
- Yes, there is no reason.

2045
02:24:57,731 --> 02:24:59,607
Okay, thank you.

2046
02:25:14,373 --> 02:25:18,084
- The train arrives with a delay ...
- I heard.

2047
02:25:21,296 --> 02:25:23,005
Your luggage is there.

2048
02:25:25,133 --> 02:25:27,676
I may be back to the hotel.

2049
02:25:28,095 --> 02:25:30,262
If they need me ...

2050
02:25:31,098 --> 02:25:33,099
- I stay or should I stay?
- How?

2051
02:25:33,308 --> 02:25:35,851
If they need me at the hotel ...

2052
02:25:36,061 --> 02:25:38,187
I stay or should I stay there with you?

2053
02:25:39,523 --> 02:25:40,815
Rest.

2054
02:26:01,628 --> 02:26:04,130
Will you let me instead?

2055
02:26:06,007 --> 02:26:07,341
There is an air flow there.

2056
02:26:07,551 --> 02:26:10,594
We are together.
You can shift you?

2057
02:26:10,804 --> 02:26:12,805
Simply put you there.

2058
02:27:27,923 --> 02:27:30,049
And the road to go to Suavi?

2059
02:27:30,634 --> 02:27:32,468
- At the farm?
- Yes.

2060
02:27:32,677 --> 02:27:34,637
It's far, Mr. Aydin.

2061
02:27:34,846 --> 02:27:36,180
That's not my question.

2062
02:27:36,389 --> 02:27:37,890
It practicable?

2063
02:27:38,099 --> 02:27:40,184
No, Mr. Aydin.

2064
02:27:40,393 --> 02:27:43,562
It would take the village road,
can not.

2065
02:27:44,272 --> 02:27:46,524
Very well, then, let's go.

2066
02:28:05,794 --> 02:28:08,128
What a blast!

2067
02:28:08,338 --> 02:28:11,549
Exprerience,
I came to visit you.

2068
02:28:11,758 --> 02:28:14,593
You did well.
Come in, it's best.

2069
02:28:16,638 --> 02:28:18,138
Come in, come.

2070
02:28:18,348 --> 02:28:19,932
- Thank you.
- This way.

2071
02:28:20,141 --> 02:28:22,351
- Sit down, warm up.
- Thank you.

2072
02:28:22,561 --> 02:28:24,353
I expect Levent.

2073
02:28:24,563 --> 02:28:26,313
I thought it was him that sounded.

2074
02:28:26,523 --> 02:28:29,608
But with him, you never know.

2075
02:28:29,818 --> 02:28:31,360
It is capable of not coming.

2076
02:28:32,487 --> 02:28:34,989
See you all Saturday afternoon.

2077
02:28:35,198 --> 02:28:36,949
On Sunday morning, we go hunting.

2078
02:28:38,410 --> 02:28:42,830
Two old bachelors, what.
We support each other.

2079
02:28:43,915 --> 02:28:46,375
Suavi, I can extend my leg?

2080
02:28:46,585 --> 02:28:48,460
- I beg you.
- I have a cramp.

2081
02:28:48,670 --> 02:28:50,754
Put the above, go ahead.

2082
02:28:51,881 --> 02:28:53,215
You're good here.

2083
02:28:54,134 --> 02:28:55,759
It's beautiful, warm,

2084
02:28:55,969 --> 02:28:57,469
comfortable sofas ...

2085
02:28:57,637 --> 02:28:59,263
You must be cold.

2086
02:28:59,639 --> 02:29:01,640
I have something for you.

2087
02:29:01,850 --> 02:29:05,394
One gulp, and forget the cold.

2088
02:29:06,062 --> 02:29:08,397
You tell me the news.

2089
02:29:10,275 --> 02:29:12,901
This is what we take for hunting.

2090
02:29:13,111 --> 02:29:15,029
One puts in our flanges.

2091
02:29:16,906 --> 02:29:19,617
There, the cold does not laugh.

2092
02:29:20,160 --> 02:29:21,827
The teacher is young,

2093
02:29:22,412 --> 02:29:23,704
strong as an ox.

2094
02:29:23,913 --> 02:29:26,540
But me, I need fuel.

2095
02:29:26,750 --> 02:29:29,668
I think I'll avoid.
I do not usually.

2096
02:29:29,878 --> 02:29:31,503
You have a lime or sage?

2097
02:29:31,713 --> 02:29:35,758
You will take in your home.
Here is me, the leader.

2098
02:29:35,967 --> 02:29:38,427
Well, okay. Thank you.

2099
02:29:39,679 --> 02:29:43,307
This is my new guilty pleasure.

2100
02:29:43,475 --> 02:29:46,101
We deserve that, at our age.

2101
02:29:47,354 --> 02:29:49,021
I'm warmed up.

2102
02:29:51,608 --> 02:29:52,566
Thank you.

2103
02:29:52,776 --> 02:29:54,485
It heats well, this stove.

2104
02:29:55,612 --> 02:29:57,863
I will not heat everywhere.

2105
02:29:58,073 --> 02:30:00,658
Since the death of my wife,
I closed parts

2106
02:30:00,867 --> 02:30:02,284
I use to store.

2107
02:30:02,494 --> 02:30:04,244
I installed the stove here.

2108
02:30:04,454 --> 02:30:07,247
It became my refuge
I just curl up.

2109
02:30:07,457 --> 02:30:09,333
And I save, suddenly.

2110
02:30:11,044 --> 02:30:13,837
By the way, what did you do
for the letter?

2111
02:30:14,047 --> 02:30:15,214
What letter?

2112
02:30:15,423 --> 02:30:18,425
The one you read Nihal and me.

2113
02:30:19,177 --> 02:30:20,969
Daughter Garip
who wanted to help.

2114
02:30:22,097 --> 02:30:23,722
I did nothing.

2115
02:30:26,601 --> 02:30:28,477
This is our teacher!

2116
02:30:29,604 --> 02:30:31,438
Mr. Aydin, nice to see you!

2117
02:30:31,648 --> 02:30:32,940
Thank you, Levent.

2118
02:30:33,149 --> 02:30:35,651
- Do not get up.
- I am numb leg.

2119
02:30:35,860 --> 02:30:38,904
As long as it's just that ...

2120
02:30:39,114 --> 02:30:39,863
Hello.

2121
02:30:40,031 --> 02:30:41,490
We went in the corner,

2122
02:30:41,700 --> 02:30:42,908
we visited him.

2123
02:30:43,118 --> 02:30:43,992
Very well.

2124
02:30:44,160 --> 02:30:45,536
The roads are difficult?

2125
02:30:45,745 --> 02:30:48,580
Terrible.
I had a lot to come to harm.

2126
02:30:48,790 --> 02:30:51,208
Mr. Aydin, I'll wait outside.

2127
02:30:51,418 --> 02:30:52,459
OK.

2128
02:30:53,962 --> 02:30:56,004
- Hidayet ...
- Yes, Mr. Aydin.

2129
02:30:56,214 --> 02:30:57,339
Come here.

2130
02:30:58,842 --> 02:30:59,842
Forgiveness.

2131
02:31:03,221 --> 02:31:04,304
listen

2132
02:31:04,806 --> 02:31:08,058
do not tell anyone at home
I'm there.

2133
02:31:08,268 --> 02:31:10,185
Of course not.

2134
02:31:10,895 --> 02:31:12,688
What do I tell them?

2135
02:31:12,897 --> 02:31:14,231
Nothing.

2136
02:31:14,441 --> 02:31:17,317
But if asked?

2137
02:31:18,528 --> 02:31:22,990
You invent. No one must know
I did not go.

2138
02:31:23,199 --> 02:31:25,409
- OK.
- I trust you.

2139
02:31:29,581 --> 02:31:33,542
I was very happy
to meet you, the last time,

2140
02:31:33,752 --> 02:31:35,377
but you disappeared.

2141
02:31:35,587 --> 02:31:38,964
Thank you. Yes, I had an unexpected.

2142
02:31:39,966 --> 02:31:41,175
I had to sneak out.

2143
02:31:41,384 --> 02:31:42,968
I have better luck today.

2144
02:31:43,303 --> 02:31:45,053
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

2145
02:31:45,263 --> 02:31:47,723
Wood, it will put you back
the ideas in place.

2146
02:31:57,650 --> 02:32:00,360
Hello? What's new?

2147
02:32:04,616 --> 02:32:06,074
Listen ...

2148
02:32:07,368 --> 02:32:10,412
do not tell Ms. Nihal
or anyone,

2149
02:32:10,622 --> 02:32:14,541
but we are at Suavi, on the farm.

2150
02:32:17,545 --> 02:32:18,796
There is no party.

2151
02:32:19,964 --> 02:32:21,507
He changed his mind.

2152
02:32:23,676 --> 02:32:26,512
I know, me.
You want to ask him?

2153
02:32:28,765 --> 02:32:31,809
But why I lie?
You're crazy?

2154
02:32:32,644 --> 02:32:33,936
How you say?

2155
02:32:34,729 --> 02:32:36,396
Do not start again, Fatma.

2156
02:32:36,606 --> 02:32:39,775
I'm trying to peel me out.
You delusions or what?

2157
02:32:39,984 --> 02:32:41,485
Come on ...

2158
02:32:41,694 --> 02:32:42,903
When I was little,

2159
02:32:43,696 --> 02:32:46,490
I was playing in the garden here

2160
02:32:47,617 --> 02:32:52,663
and I felt that this life
my parents would last indefinitely.

2161
02:32:54,082 --> 02:32:55,582
Where is this?

2162
02:32:56,960 --> 02:33:02,047
When is this house
was emptied?

2163
02:33:03,174 --> 02:33:07,761
When do
the little boy his mother

2164
02:33:08,263 --> 02:33:11,890
became the lonely old drunkard?

2165
02:33:13,935 --> 02:33:15,477
I got married.

2166
02:33:15,687 --> 02:33:17,104
I had a child.

2167
02:33:18,606 --> 02:33:19,898
Where are they?

2168
02:33:21,317 --> 02:33:24,444
My wife underground,
my daughter at the end of the world.

2169
02:33:26,948 --> 02:33:28,657
That's why I say:

2170
02:33:29,242 --> 02:33:32,703
Since there are things
we can not change,

2171
02:33:33,746 --> 02:33:36,748
you have to be a little flexible.

2172
02:33:37,542 --> 02:33:39,334
Do not judge people.

2173
02:33:40,670 --> 02:33:42,754
Accept things as they are.

2174
02:33:46,634 --> 02:33:48,343
It's hot, right?

2175
02:33:49,345 --> 02:33:51,388
You can open a little?

2176
02:33:52,390 --> 02:33:54,224
Of course, opens the window.

2177
02:33:57,145 --> 02:33:59,146
We too will thereby Levent?

2178
02:33:59,355 --> 02:34:00,439
OK.

2179
02:34:00,648 --> 02:34:03,609
- Go ahead, I'll get something.
- OK.

2180
02:34:12,827 --> 02:34:15,162
It's hot, I'm a little drunk ...

2181
02:34:15,371 --> 02:34:16,955
I feel dizzy.

2182
02:34:17,332 --> 02:34:19,416
I would not have had to drink.

2183
02:34:20,043 --> 02:34:21,460
Too late.

2184
02:34:36,184 --> 02:34:38,477
Tell me, Levent, how old are you?

2185
02:34:39,562 --> 02:34:40,604
35.

2186
02:34:40,813 --> 02:34:43,231
- You do not!
- But if.

2187
02:34:44,567 --> 02:34:45,776
You have a family?

2188
02:34:46,611 --> 02:34:48,946
My family is in Yozgat, home.

2189
02:34:49,572 --> 02:34:51,198
My mother and my older sister.

2190
02:34:52,075 --> 02:34:54,076
You did not get married?

2191
02:34:54,285 --> 02:34:55,243
Say ...

2192
02:34:55,453 --> 02:34:57,829
it is fate.
It did not.

2193
02:34:58,039 --> 02:34:59,873
I have not met the right person.

2194
02:35:00,708 --> 02:35:05,003
And I do not really have the means.
I'm in no hurry.

2195
02:35:05,213 --> 02:35:07,047
To live here,

2196
02:35:07,590 --> 02:35:09,216
your salary widely enough.

2197
02:35:09,425 --> 02:35:11,426
That is true.

2198
02:35:11,844 --> 02:35:14,972
But I send half to my mother,

2199
02:35:15,181 --> 02:35:17,349
that sets aside for my sister.

2200
02:35:17,558 --> 02:35:20,477
It is a priority for the wedding.

2201
02:35:20,687 --> 02:35:22,771
For me, we'll see later.

2202
02:35:24,232 --> 02:35:26,149
It's how long you're there?

2203
02:35:27,193 --> 02:35:29,486
This is my fourth year.

2204
02:35:30,613 --> 02:35:31,655
You gonna stay?

2205
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:37,369
I could go, but you get used to.

2206
02:35:38,413 --> 02:35:41,665
And then there is the work
with Nihal.

2207
02:35:41,874 --> 02:35:43,542
I can not leave him.

2208
02:35:43,751 --> 02:35:45,794
This is not a problem, that.

2209
02:35:47,463 --> 02:35:51,008
There will always be someone
to replace you.

2210
02:35:52,844 --> 02:35:54,886
Of course, you're right.

2211
02:35:57,348 --> 02:36:00,475
When I was little, I stuttered.

2212
02:36:00,852 --> 02:36:02,352
- Really?
- Yes.

2213
02:36:03,312 --> 02:36:05,981
I spent my childhood in silent.

2214
02:36:06,399 --> 02:36:09,651
That's why I talk too much,
now.

2215
02:36:12,572 --> 02:36:14,781
So, sorry if I knock you down.

2216
02:36:15,199 --> 02:36:16,199
We must tell me.

2217
02:36:16,409 --> 02:36:18,869
But no, talk all you want.

2218
02:36:19,078 --> 02:36:21,413
You totally deserved it, my friend.

2219
02:36:22,415 --> 02:36:25,709
Anyway, I prefer to listen.

2220
02:36:26,294 --> 02:36:27,753
I have warned you.

2221
02:36:28,379 --> 02:36:29,629
Hot chestnuts!

2222
02:36:30,339 --> 02:36:32,257
Cursed be that do not taste.

2223
02:36:32,467 --> 02:36:34,384
Hot to hot.

2224
02:36:35,386 --> 02:36:37,763
We used split chestnuts!

2225
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:54,798
Yes?

2226
02:37:56,134 --> 02:37:57,384
Good Evening.

2227
02:37:57,593 --> 02:37:59,553
Sorry to bother you.

2228
02:37:59,762 --> 02:38:01,805
I just see Hamdi Hodja.

2229
02:38:02,014 --> 02:38:03,390
Is he here?

2230
02:38:04,475 --> 02:38:05,517
A moment.

2231
02:38:18,781 --> 02:38:19,990
Ms. Nihal?

2232
02:38:21,492 --> 02:38:23,577
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

2233
02:38:23,995 --> 02:38:27,247
Sorry, I was inside,
I could not ...

2234
02:38:27,456 --> 02:38:28,582
What can I do for you?

2235
02:38:28,791 --> 02:38:32,419
It is I who apologize
to come so late.

2236
02:38:32,628 --> 02:38:35,589
No, please.
Come in.

2237
02:38:36,799 --> 02:38:38,675
It's not too late?

2238
02:38:38,885 --> 02:38:40,760
No, of course.

2239
02:38:40,970 --> 02:38:42,262
Come in, please.

2240
02:38:42,471 --> 02:38:44,472
- Thank you.
- Do not stay in the cold.

2241
02:38:44,682 --> 02:38:45,807
Thank you.

2242
02:38:47,268 --> 02:38:49,144
Go sit by the stove.

2243
02:38:49,353 --> 02:38:50,896
This is fine here, thank you.

2244
02:38:51,105 --> 02:38:53,648
It's cold near the door.
Keep your shoes.

2245
02:38:53,858 --> 02:38:56,443
Thank you. I will not stay long.

2246
02:38:57,528 --> 02:38:59,029
As you like.

2247
02:39:12,210 --> 02:39:14,377
All is well, I hope, Ms. Nihal?

2248
02:39:14,837 --> 02:39:18,673
Excuse me, but to see you alone ...

2249
02:39:18,883 --> 02:39:23,136
I wanted to know how was Ilyas.
It worried us the other day.

2250
02:39:23,346 --> 02:39:26,348
We got the news,
but I wanted to visit.

2251
02:39:26,891 --> 02:39:29,267
Ilyas is much better.

2252
02:39:29,477 --> 02:39:32,896
Thank God, he has no fever.
It goes very well.

2253
02:39:33,105 --> 02:39:37,275
We were worried,
but yesterday he opened his eyes.

2254
02:39:38,027 --> 02:39:42,030
It is a little bored at home,
as he missed school.

2255
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:43,949
But it is well, thank you God.

2256
02:39:44,325 --> 02:39:45,784
It is not easy.

2257
02:39:46,661 --> 02:39:50,330
I was concerned to learn
it was pneumonia.

2258
02:39:50,915 --> 02:39:52,916
But his mother had to take care of him.

2259
02:39:53,125 --> 02:39:58,088
He has taken his medication
and it is healed, big boy.

2260
02:39:58,714 --> 02:40:00,215
That's it.

2261
02:40:00,967 --> 02:40:02,050
Thank you.

2262
02:40:05,179 --> 02:40:06,596
Mr. Aydin is not with you?

2263
02:40:08,391 --> 02:40:09,641
No, I came alone.

2264
02:40:10,851 --> 02:40:13,270
Really? Welcome.

2265
02:40:15,356 --> 02:40:17,816
You must be cold. It freezes.

2266
02:40:18,025 --> 02:40:19,693
It was tea ... Sevda!

2267
02:40:20,653 --> 02:40:22,570
I go to the kitchen.

2268
02:40:22,780 --> 02:40:25,573
- Do not bother.
- I beg you.

2269
02:40:41,424 --> 02:40:42,632
You work?

2270
02:40:46,762 --> 02:40:47,846
Is that it?

2271
02:40:48,973 --> 02:40:49,931
Yes.

2272
02:40:53,644 --> 02:40:56,271
- What is it?
- Some math.

2273
02:40:57,565 --> 02:40:58,732
Do you like math?

2274
02:40:59,066 --> 02:40:59,941
Yes.

2275
02:41:00,151 --> 02:41:02,360
You want to do what? Engineer?

2276
02:41:03,195 --> 02:41:04,321
Not.

2277
02:41:05,865 --> 02:41:07,449
What, then?

2278
02:41:07,658 --> 02:41:08,700
Policeman.

2279
02:41:09,660 --> 02:41:10,910
Why?

2280
02:41:22,882 --> 02:41:24,215
Good evening, madam.

2281
02:41:24,425 --> 02:41:26,676
Good Evening. Who are you?

2282
02:41:28,387 --> 02:41:31,473
Mom, Mrs. Nihal,
the wife of our owner.

2283
02:41:33,976 --> 02:41:35,518
She reports on TV?

2284
02:41:35,728 --> 02:41:38,688
No, Mom.
That's another story, that.

2285
02:41:39,231 --> 02:41:40,273
Come on, Mom.

2286
02:41:41,025 --> 02:41:43,443
I watched the imam. I want my TV.

2287
02:41:43,652 --> 02:41:46,196
Ms. Nihal did not come for that.

2288
02:41:46,364 --> 02:41:48,198
She comes to visit Ilyas.

2289
02:41:48,407 --> 02:41:49,616
- You knees hurt?
- Very.

2290
02:41:50,284 --> 02:41:52,702
- Must cover.
- I do not want.

2291
02:41:52,912 --> 02:41:53,661
OK.

2292
02:41:53,871 --> 02:41:56,456
You do not take me to the doctor.

2293
02:41:57,041 --> 02:42:00,377
Do not embarrass us
before Ms. Nihal, Mom.

2294
02:42:00,586 --> 02:42:02,921
- You do not want to go.
- There were too many people.

2295
02:42:03,130 --> 02:42:06,424
I will not go there.
I want a private doctor.

2296
02:42:06,634 --> 02:42:07,967
But anyway ...

2297
02:42:08,761 --> 02:42:11,179
I offered to take you there.

2298
02:42:11,389 --> 02:42:13,515
In our cousin Samet ...

2299
02:42:13,724 --> 02:42:16,101
You forget what his mother did to me?

2300
02:42:16,602 --> 02:42:19,229
His mother is his mother.
Him, he's a doctor.

2301
02:42:19,438 --> 02:42:20,688
I want a doctor
come here.

2302
02:42:20,898 --> 02:42:23,400
Okay, I will bring one.

2303
02:42:23,609 --> 02:42:25,777
He will take care
my mother's home.

2304
02:42:25,986 --> 02:42:28,154
Sevda, bring me my rosary.

2305
02:42:28,322 --> 02:42:29,406
I'm sorry.

2306
02:42:30,116 --> 02:42:31,032
I beg you.

2307
02:42:31,242 --> 02:42:34,285
Young, we are taught respect,
later, compassion.

2308
02:42:34,829 --> 02:42:37,205
God bless our seniors.

2309
02:42:37,415 --> 02:42:39,958
If youth knew,
if old age could ...

2310
02:42:40,167 --> 02:42:43,420
I do not want
bother you long.

2311
02:42:44,505 --> 02:42:46,214
I would like to talk to you.

2312
02:42:47,425 --> 02:42:48,716
I beg you.

2313
02:42:50,845 --> 02:42:55,098
Will you be it in private?

2314
02:42:56,308 --> 02:42:58,977
Sure, why not?

2315
02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:03,606
You can go next door
but it might get cold.

2316
02:43:03,816 --> 02:43:05,984
This is not serious.

2317
02:43:06,193 --> 02:43:07,777
Let's go. Sevda!

2318
02:43:07,945 --> 02:43:09,612
Put wood in the fireplace.

2319
02:43:10,281 --> 02:43:12,073
I take your tea.

2320
02:43:13,284 --> 02:43:14,868
- Thank you.
- I beg you.

2321
02:43:19,790 --> 02:43:21,499
You have how many pieces?

2322
02:43:22,334 --> 02:43:24,169
There were two.

2323
02:43:24,378 --> 02:43:27,088
Thereof was added.

2324
02:43:27,506 --> 02:43:31,468
Courtesy
Your father-in late, Mr. Sami.

2325
02:43:32,344 --> 02:43:34,053
We have three rooms now.

2326
02:43:34,263 --> 02:43:36,181
This is my room.

2327
02:43:36,599 --> 02:43:39,017
It's colder there.

2328
02:43:39,560 --> 02:43:43,438
It was a fireplace.
I turn it on when the winter is harsh.

2329
02:43:44,106 --> 02:43:46,065
Fortunately, not this year.

2330
02:43:46,275 --> 02:43:47,525
That is true.

2331
02:43:48,861 --> 02:43:52,489
Hamdi, I would
ask you something.

2332
02:43:52,698 --> 02:43:53,990
I beg you.

2333
02:43:56,035 --> 02:43:57,911
Your younger brother, Ismail ...

2334
02:43:58,120 --> 02:44:00,872
- My older brother ...
- Oh, sorry.

2335
02:44:01,373 --> 02:44:04,042
What does he do for a living?

2336
02:44:06,128 --> 02:44:10,256
He did more work.
Before, he was in the mine, Tozlu.

2337
02:44:10,466 --> 02:44:13,176
But unfortunately,
He got into trouble.

2338
02:44:13,677 --> 02:44:16,179
It has been six months in prison.

2339
02:44:16,388 --> 02:44:17,805
Since he is unemployed.

2340
02:44:18,265 --> 02:44:21,726
If I may ...

2341
02:44:21,936 --> 02:44:23,645
why he was in prison?

2342
02:44:23,854 --> 02:44:25,021
What has he done?

2343
02:44:25,231 --> 02:44:28,191
It's really embarrassing for me.

2344
02:44:28,526 --> 02:44:31,110
I do not want
you see us like this.

2345
02:44:32,196 --> 02:44:35,782
But I will not hide
God already knows.

2346
02:44:36,534 --> 02:44:38,618
The noise had to run, anyway.

2347
02:44:40,329 --> 02:44:43,206
There were thugs
harassing his wife Sevda.

2348
02:44:43,415 --> 02:44:45,917
We only learned later.

2349
02:44:46,418 --> 02:44:51,005
One night, we heard Ismail
who had risen to great sound.

2350
02:44:51,215 --> 02:44:52,840
He ran after the guy down the street.

2351
02:44:55,761 --> 02:44:56,886
I am ashamed to say ...

2352
02:44:58,013 --> 02:45:01,099
They came to steal underwear
Sevda of the string.

2353
02:45:01,642 --> 02:45:03,643
He could not catch them.

2354
02:45:04,186 --> 02:45:06,312
He lashed out at Sevda that night.

2355
02:45:06,522 --> 02:45:08,815
The poor man was not even
report.

2356
02:45:09,441 --> 02:45:12,193
The next day at the market,
crossing Ismail,

2357
02:45:12,820 --> 02:45:15,446
these thugs mocked him.

2358
02:45:15,656 --> 02:45:18,825
Ismail took out his knife
and injured one.

2359
02:45:22,037 --> 02:45:25,164
It took six months for that.

2360
02:45:27,501 --> 02:45:30,587
It has always been a bit wild.

2361
02:45:31,672 --> 02:45:34,257
Not one to be approached.

2362
02:45:35,301 --> 02:45:39,262
From prison
it is even more wary and shy.

2363
02:45:39,471 --> 02:45:41,806
He does not talk to anybody in the village.

2364
02:45:42,016 --> 02:45:43,725
He got fired.

2365
02:45:44,768 --> 02:45:48,021
He shut and began to drink.

2366
02:45:49,148 --> 02:45:50,898
But not at home.

2367
02:45:52,860 --> 02:45:54,902
He does not work.

2368
02:45:56,030 --> 02:45:59,407
We had to pay for the operation
and allowances for the guy.

2369
02:46:00,117 --> 02:46:02,243
There has been much indebted.

2370
02:46:02,620 --> 02:46:06,456
As we only have my salary,

2371
02:46:07,082 --> 02:46:08,541
it is difficult.

2372
02:46:08,751 --> 02:46:10,460
We could not pay the rent.

2373
02:46:11,170 --> 02:46:14,005
I understand Mr. Aydin.

2374
02:46:14,465 --> 02:46:17,925
Trouble we created him
with these months in arrears.

2375
02:46:19,803 --> 02:46:22,096
But I hope to find
a second job.

2376
02:46:23,098 --> 02:46:24,390
I understand.

2377
02:46:25,142 --> 02:46:26,726
I hope it will work out.

2378
02:46:28,062 --> 02:46:31,439
Exactly, my visit
has to do with that.

2379
02:46:33,400 --> 02:46:36,653
I do not want to keep you,
It's late.

2380
02:46:51,460 --> 02:46:53,836
Take that and accept it.

2381
02:46:58,050 --> 02:46:59,133
What is it?

2382
02:46:59,635 --> 02:47:00,843
Open.

2383
02:47:19,196 --> 02:47:20,780
What is it?

2384
02:47:21,865 --> 02:47:23,741
Do not get me wrong.

2385
02:47:24,451 --> 02:47:26,869
I want to give you this money.

2386
02:47:27,830 --> 02:47:29,372
Take it, please.

2387
02:47:30,708 --> 02:47:33,710
Yes, but I do not understand.

2388
02:47:33,919 --> 02:47:37,380
Why this money?
Why you give us?

2389
02:47:38,257 --> 02:47:39,424
Do not worry.

2390
02:47:39,633 --> 02:47:42,218
I do not want anything in return,

2391
02:47:42,428 --> 02:47:44,804
or that you reimburse me.

2392
02:47:45,013 --> 02:47:49,892
Accept it as a friendly support.

2393
02:47:51,729 --> 02:47:53,563
I'm sorry, Ms. Nihal.

2394
02:47:53,772 --> 02:47:56,357
I do not know what to say.

2395
02:47:57,109 --> 02:47:59,777
This is a large sum.

2396
02:48:01,113 --> 02:48:02,947
How can I accept it?

2397
02:48:03,490 --> 02:48:05,408
There are almost
enough to buy a house.

2398
02:48:06,285 --> 02:48:08,870
- What will people say?
- Mr. Hamdi ...

2399
02:48:09,455 --> 02:48:11,539
No one will know.

2400
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:16,586
It will stay between you and me.

2401
02:48:28,098 --> 02:48:29,640
Welcome.

2402
02:48:29,850 --> 02:48:30,975
Thank you.

2403
02:48:31,852 --> 02:48:35,104
- Sorry to bother you so late.
- I beg you.

2404
02:48:35,314 --> 02:48:38,191
Ismail, Mrs. Nihal,
the wife of Mr. Aydin.

2405
02:48:38,400 --> 02:48:40,193
I know, it warned me.

2406
02:48:55,125 --> 02:48:56,292
What happen?

2407
02:48:57,795 --> 02:49:00,630
Come sit.

2408
02:49:01,715 --> 02:49:03,090
Come on.

2409
02:49:12,684 --> 02:49:16,270
Ms. Nihal was worried
for Ilyas.

2410
02:49:16,730 --> 02:49:19,273
She came to visit him.

2411
02:49:20,526 --> 02:49:21,943
It's there for.

2412
02:49:25,572 --> 02:49:26,572
And that?

2413
02:49:30,327 --> 02:49:33,162
Ms. Nihal brought us the money.

2414
02:49:33,539 --> 02:49:34,705
It's very nice.

2415
02:49:39,628 --> 02:49:41,045
What's the occasion?

2416
02:49:41,630 --> 02:49:44,715
Do not get me wrong.
There is no specific reason.

2417
02:49:45,300 --> 02:49:48,135
I thought you needed it.

2418
02:49:48,345 --> 02:49:50,763
You might get your things.

2419
02:49:57,312 --> 02:49:59,188
Mr. Aydin, what he said?

2420
02:49:59,940 --> 02:50:01,566
It is not know.

2421
02:50:02,234 --> 02:50:04,151
And he did not know.

2422
02:50:07,406 --> 02:50:09,115
Very well.

2423
02:50:20,377 --> 02:50:21,961
But all that money ...

2424
02:50:22,963 --> 02:50:24,797
it's not too much?

2425
02:50:27,259 --> 02:50:28,885
It corresponds to what?

2426
02:50:30,137 --> 02:50:33,598
What you thought
bringing us so much money?

2427
02:50:34,016 --> 02:50:36,225
- I have not thought of.
- Excuse him.

2428
02:50:36,393 --> 02:50:38,644
We are sorry. It is a little surprised.

2429
02:50:38,854 --> 02:50:42,565
Ismail, you do not want
you put water on your face?

2430
02:50:43,901 --> 02:50:45,276
No, it's okay.

2431
02:50:46,153 --> 02:50:48,613
I'll get you some coffee, then.

2432
02:50:49,114 --> 02:50:50,740
It will do you good.

2433
02:50:51,116 --> 02:50:53,743
Ms. Nihal, I bring you another tea.

2434
02:50:54,286 --> 02:50:55,828
It is cool.

2435
02:50:56,288 --> 02:50:59,540
- Do not bother.
- Yes, yes.

2436
02:51:01,752 --> 02:51:03,085
Sevda ...

2437
02:51:13,430 --> 02:51:14,722
So ...

2438
02:51:19,269 --> 02:51:20,603
let's see ...

2439
02:51:22,522 --> 02:51:24,357
if the account is good.

2440
02:51:31,949 --> 02:51:34,533
That it must be for ...

2441
02:51:36,787 --> 02:51:41,874
the small Ilyas who risked his life
to save the wounded pride of his father.

2442
02:51:49,383 --> 02:51:50,883
And this ...

2443
02:51:51,885 --> 02:51:54,053
for selflessness brother Hamdi

2444
02:51:54,262 --> 02:51:58,557
who went to kneel apologetically
to have four mouths to feed.

2445
02:52:02,813 --> 02:52:04,230
This ...

2446
02:52:05,065 --> 02:52:08,317
for Ismail dad drunk

2447
02:52:08,944 --> 02:52:13,906
who was beaten up in front of her son
and the shame of his family.

2448
02:52:26,336 --> 02:52:28,087
But it still remains.

2449
02:52:30,632 --> 02:52:34,301
That's our heroine,
Ms. Nihal

2450
02:52:34,803 --> 02:52:38,556
that relieves his conscience
giving alms

2451
02:52:38,765 --> 02:52:42,435
to those who are less fortunate than her.

2452
02:52:44,062 --> 02:52:45,938
So the account is good.

2453
02:52:47,983 --> 02:52:49,734
You have calculated.

2454
02:52:55,073 --> 02:52:57,616
It's really nice of you.

2455
02:52:59,619 --> 02:53:02,288
But what you remember,

2456
02:53:03,081 --> 02:53:04,498
Ms. Nihal,

2457
02:53:07,586 --> 02:53:09,378
is that you have in front of you

2458
02:53:10,839 --> 02:53:13,758
dirty drunkard unable to appreciate

2459
02:53:14,509 --> 02:53:16,385
your generosity.

2460
02:54:50,939 --> 02:54:53,107
When I see all that,

2461
02:54:53,650 --> 02:54:55,109
I look ...

2462
02:54:55,443 --> 02:54:58,529
I say, it's not a life we have,

2463
02:54:58,738 --> 02:55:01,115
this is a bad room.

2464
02:55:01,324 --> 02:55:03,617
It is a kind of life!

2465
02:55:03,827 --> 02:55:05,786
- That's right.
- I am not mistaken?

2466
02:55:05,996 --> 02:55:07,037
You're right.

2467
02:55:07,205 --> 02:55:09,081
We must stand up.

2468
02:55:09,791 --> 02:55:12,626
Straight, upright.
Stiff as stakes.

2469
02:55:12,836 --> 02:55:16,463
And say, "Go, go, hits!
Hit me if you want. "

2470
02:55:16,673 --> 02:55:19,258
Standing, like real men.

2471
02:55:19,467 --> 02:55:22,428
We will not yield, we will not whine.

2472
02:55:22,637 --> 02:55:23,596
Stand up!

2473
02:55:24,347 --> 02:55:26,473
It's like that, Mr. Aydin.

2474
02:55:27,726 --> 02:55:30,936
Today, our moral values

2475
02:55:31,146 --> 02:55:33,147
come religions,

2476
02:55:33,356 --> 02:55:38,694
many reject and deny,
all around the world.

2477
02:55:38,904 --> 02:55:44,200
If I am against these values, why
I still base my life on it?

2478
02:55:44,409 --> 02:55:47,870
In this case,
it is completely bogus, my life.

2479
02:55:48,079 --> 02:55:51,665
So either we need to strengthen
the basis of these values,

2480
02:55:52,500 --> 02:55:55,836
either have to create new ones.

2481
02:55:56,046 --> 02:55:57,421
Suavi, brother,

2482
02:55:57,589 --> 02:55:59,840
must be created.

2483
02:56:00,175 --> 02:56:03,719
- It's good if you can create them.
- Yes, but listen ...

2484
02:56:05,263 --> 02:56:07,431
We try to live better,

2485
02:56:08,225 --> 02:56:12,311
but there are not that miss you,
you looking mess.

2486
02:56:12,520 --> 02:56:16,607
So when you cross their path,
it's frictions, inevitably.

2487
02:56:16,816 --> 02:56:22,488
But those who are strong, innovative,
they go forward, they do not care.

2488
02:56:22,697 --> 02:56:25,616
Oddly, the conflict, it feeds them.

2489
02:56:25,825 --> 02:56:29,161
They are flexible enough to accept it.

2490
02:56:30,247 --> 02:56:32,790
The conflict, it opens their mind,

2491
02:56:32,999 --> 02:56:35,334
it nourishes creativity.

2492
02:56:35,543 --> 02:56:37,670
When I see them,

2493
02:56:37,879 --> 02:56:41,966
I think they do not care critics
because they are brave.

2494
02:56:42,175 --> 02:56:44,176
We should do the same.

2495
02:56:44,386 --> 02:56:46,762
Of course, one could say:

2496
02:56:46,972 --> 02:56:50,307
"You drink like holes,
you empiffrez you

2497
02:56:50,517 --> 02:56:54,645
"and after, you want to help
poor school. "

2498
02:56:54,854 --> 02:56:57,940
But we must not listen to them,
we must move forward.

2499
02:56:58,149 --> 02:57:00,901
For example, during the earthquake,
there are six,

2500
02:57:01,111 --> 02:57:03,988
when you have not opened
Hotel victims

2501
02:57:04,197 --> 02:57:07,783
but relief,

2502
02:57:07,993 --> 02:57:10,202
to make you money ...

2503
02:57:10,412 --> 02:57:13,706
This is what some have thought.

2504
02:57:13,915 --> 02:57:16,250
It's interesting what he says.

2505
02:57:16,459 --> 02:57:20,254
They even blame you
to be rich.

2506
02:57:20,463 --> 02:57:21,922
- It is possible.
- Wait ...

2507
02:57:22,132 --> 02:57:23,674
One second, please.

2508
02:57:24,050 --> 02:57:26,302
What's the connection?

2509
02:57:26,511 --> 02:57:28,053
How did you come by that?

2510
02:57:28,263 --> 02:57:29,972
I give an example.

2511
02:57:30,181 --> 02:57:33,058
You insinuating something here?

2512
02:57:33,268 --> 02:57:37,896
If we did not welcome the victims
there was reason ...

2513
02:57:38,106 --> 02:57:41,859
What's insinuations,
without knowing anything about the story?

2514
02:57:42,068 --> 02:57:47,781
Hundreds of people landed
from abroad, it was necessary to put where?

2515
02:57:48,575 --> 02:57:50,367
Could accommodate where?

2516
02:57:50,577 --> 02:57:53,746
These people trapped under the rubble,
which would have left?

2517
02:57:53,955 --> 02:57:56,874
- I said nothing.
- Nobody thinks that.

2518
02:57:57,083 --> 02:57:58,625
I gave an example.

2519
02:57:59,586 --> 02:58:04,381
Frankly, I'm surprised you,
this kind of judgment, Bulent.

2520
02:58:04,591 --> 02:58:07,384
- I do not judge.
- That's not good.

2521
02:58:07,594 --> 02:58:11,263
I may have misspoken.
I meant ...

2522
02:58:11,473 --> 02:58:15,142
- You evil words, Levent.
- But no.

2523
02:58:16,895 --> 02:58:19,355
There is truth in what you said,

2524
02:58:19,564 --> 02:58:21,857
but you've misspoken.

2525
02:58:22,067 --> 02:58:25,235
I'm just saying that there are people
like this ...

2526
02:58:25,445 --> 02:58:30,866
What to do with me and my hotel?

2527
02:58:31,076 --> 02:58:34,036
I'm just saying
people can say ...

2528
02:58:34,245 --> 02:58:37,706
More ... wait ...

2529
02:58:37,916 --> 02:58:40,042
This is exactly what I say.

2530
02:58:40,251 --> 02:58:45,464
I can not stop making donations
years.

2531
02:58:45,673 --> 02:58:47,091
Bravo, but I not talking about that.

2532
02:58:47,300 --> 02:58:48,967
Just yesterday,

2533
02:58:49,302 --> 02:58:53,055
I gave a large sum
for fundraising.

2534
02:58:53,264 --> 02:58:58,018
Besides, I have always done
anonymously discretion.

2535
02:58:58,228 --> 02:58:59,937
- That's right.
- Well Done.

2536
02:59:00,146 --> 02:59:02,189
But I did not say otherwise.

2537
02:59:02,399 --> 02:59:04,858
He misspoke.

2538
02:59:05,068 --> 02:59:06,193
I continue to stuff me

2539
02:59:06,986 --> 02:59:10,614
this kind of innuendo
and sarcasm,

2540
02:59:11,199 --> 02:59:13,784
Just because we have a little money?

2541
02:59:13,993 --> 02:59:17,454
I wanted to say:
There are people like that

2542
02:59:17,664 --> 02:59:19,498
and I fuck!

2543
02:59:19,707 --> 02:59:21,500
I too Fuck them.

2544
02:59:21,709 --> 02:59:28,549
But it is not possible to judge
without knowing the situation.

2545
02:59:28,758 --> 02:59:30,759
I misspoke.

2546
02:59:30,969 --> 02:59:34,430
A bit of morality and conscience,
Please!

2547
02:59:35,306 --> 02:59:38,225
Come on, my boy,
Tell him your misspoke.

2548
02:59:39,144 --> 02:59:41,812
It has nothing, is absurd.

2549
02:59:42,021 --> 02:59:43,480
That's not what he meant.

2550
02:59:43,690 --> 02:59:48,819
What is morality and conscience
come to that?

2551
02:59:49,028 --> 02:59:53,282
I can not tolerate
this kind of judgment.

2552
02:59:53,491 --> 02:59:55,242
If you attack him personally ...

2553
02:59:55,452 --> 02:59:58,287
Listen, I closed
for fifteen years.

2554
02:59:58,496 --> 03:00:02,833
My words beyond my thought.
I should have shut up.

2555
03:00:03,042 --> 03:00:07,713
It is normal that I do attack
because I have the money?

2556
03:00:07,922 --> 03:00:11,300
It was I who invented the world?
This is the system!

2557
03:00:11,509 --> 03:00:14,261
God created it that way.

2558
03:00:14,554 --> 03:00:15,804
What can I do about myself?

2559
03:00:16,014 --> 03:00:18,265
In nature either,
there is no justice.

2560
03:00:18,475 --> 03:00:20,726
Here as elsewhere.

2561
03:00:20,977 --> 03:00:23,979
- I mean those who ...
- I have nothing to do.

2562
03:00:24,147 --> 03:00:27,274
I wanted to say the same thing,

2563
03:00:27,484 --> 03:00:31,111
and you leave me
morality and conscience.

2564
03:00:31,321 --> 03:00:34,281
- I had trouble expressing myself.
- He would not ...

2565
03:00:35,158 --> 03:00:38,285
He thought not bad.
You let yourself go, little one.

2566
03:00:39,204 --> 03:00:40,704
But you said things well, too.

2567
03:00:40,914 --> 03:00:43,499
Must first think.

2568
03:00:43,750 --> 03:00:45,709
- That's right.
- We can not ...

2569
03:00:45,919 --> 03:00:47,586
I ... whatever.

2570
03:00:50,048 --> 03:00:51,715
We ate well, drank well.

2571
03:00:52,634 --> 03:00:54,718
I'll go to bed.

2572
03:00:55,220 --> 03:00:57,137
I have not slept in two days.

2573
03:00:57,347 --> 03:01:00,557
Come, my boy,
I'll give you a blanket.

2574
03:01:00,767 --> 03:01:02,935
Thank you, my friend.

2575
03:01:03,811 --> 03:01:09,066
The pochtron will stop
to break your ears.

2576
03:01:09,275 --> 03:01:11,401
I'll shut up,

2577
03:01:12,195 --> 03:01:14,154
but before leaving,

2578
03:01:15,031 --> 03:01:17,533
under your control,
dear Mr. Aydin ...

2579
03:01:17,742 --> 03:01:18,909
I beg you.

2580
03:01:19,118 --> 03:01:22,746
I will quote Shakespeare,
in conclusion.

2581
03:01:29,295 --> 03:01:30,712
"Consciousness ...

2582
03:01:31,381 --> 03:01:34,383
"is just a word to the use of loose

2583
03:01:35,510 --> 03:01:40,305
"invented first
to keep the strong in awe.

2584
03:01:53,027 --> 03:01:56,363
"That our strong arms
be our conscience,

2585
03:01:56,573 --> 03:01:58,991
"our swords our law."

2586
03:02:02,662 --> 03:02:03,829
Good night.

2587
03:02:06,374 --> 03:02:07,958
Minute.

2588
03:02:08,167 --> 03:02:13,880
Allow me then to contribute
this evening with these words,

2589
03:02:14,799 --> 03:02:16,300
in reply:

2590
03:02:21,180 --> 03:02:22,556
"Our relentless fate

2591
03:02:22,765 --> 03:02:25,892
"is the disillusionment
in all our businesses.

2592
03:02:28,271 --> 03:02:32,566
"Every morning
I conceive of brilliant projects

2593
03:02:35,278 --> 03:02:37,195
"I spend my day to wander."

2594
03:02:46,080 --> 03:02:47,456
That's it.

2595
03:02:50,960 --> 03:02:53,378
You shoot at you well again.

2596
03:03:04,265 --> 03:03:05,766
It's okay?

2597
03:03:06,351 --> 03:03:08,226
It's nothing, relax.

2598
03:03:09,479 --> 03:03:11,063
- Let yourself go.
- Sorry.

2599
03:03:11,272 --> 03:03:13,774
- It's nothing.
- I'm sorry.

2600
03:03:13,983 --> 03:03:17,069
Look at this mess.

2601
03:03:17,278 --> 03:03:19,988
It's nothing, leave it, come on.

2602
03:03:20,198 --> 03:03:22,199
- I'm sorry.
- Stepping Out.

2603
03:03:22,408 --> 03:03:27,162
Come take a good breath of fresh air
in the snow, it'll do you good.

2604
03:03:27,372 --> 03:03:30,666
Come, my friend, come.

2605
03:03:31,292 --> 03:03:33,960
Come on, do not force.

2606
03:03:34,212 --> 03:03:35,587
Come on.

2607
03:03:36,339 --> 03:03:39,007
- I'm sorry.
- Stepping Out.

2608
03:03:39,217 --> 03:03:41,635
Follow me.

2609
03:03:48,893 --> 03:03:51,311
So far we advance and that's it.

2610
03:03:57,944 --> 03:04:00,570
It must be light,
it does not sink.

2611
03:07:20,187 --> 03:07:21,938
- Hidayet, stop.
- What up?

2612
03:07:22,148 --> 03:07:23,523
Pull over.

2613
03:07:24,150 --> 03:07:26,276
I'm afraid
we can not leave.

2614
03:07:26,485 --> 03:07:27,944
- Back off a little.
- What?

2615
03:07:28,154 --> 03:07:29,613
Make a reverse.

2616
03:07:48,883 --> 03:07:49,841
Stop.

2617
03:08:13,908 --> 03:08:15,158
Mr. Aydin?

2618
03:08:17,244 --> 03:08:20,080
Nothing, that's good, let's go.

2619
03:09:15,219 --> 03:09:16,344
Fatma!

2620
03:10:03,267 --> 03:10:04,309
Nihal ...

2621
03:10:05,144 --> 03:10:06,561
I do not party.

2622
03:10:07,438 --> 03:10:09,105
I could not.

2623
03:10:11,734 --> 03:10:15,612
I become old or crazy,

2624
03:10:16,363 --> 03:10:19,199
and then another man?

2625
03:10:19,408 --> 03:10:21,284
No matter what you'll think.

2626
03:10:22,453 --> 03:10:23,536
I do not know.

2627
03:10:30,336 --> 03:10:34,547
But this new man in me holding me back.

2628
03:10:36,050 --> 03:10:38,343
You either do not hunt me.

2629
03:10:45,309 --> 03:10:48,770
I know now
nothing'm in Istanbul.

2630
03:10:50,564 --> 03:10:52,816
Everything is foreign to me,

2631
03:10:53,025 --> 03:10:55,235
there as elsewhere.

2632
03:11:00,533 --> 03:11:04,160
Know that I have no one else
than you.

2633
03:11:07,248 --> 03:11:10,917
I miss you every minute,
at every moment.

2634
03:11:13,379 --> 03:11:16,923
I will never confess to you,
my pride stop me.

2635
03:11:19,593 --> 03:11:22,637
I know it would be terrible,

2636
03:11:23,097 --> 03:11:25,890
if not impossible for me,
to separate me from you.

2637
03:11:27,852 --> 03:11:30,937
Just as I know
than you love me.

2638
03:11:38,612 --> 03:11:41,030
I know our past
will not return.

2639
03:11:42,867 --> 03:11:44,742
I do not regret it.

2640
03:11:53,878 --> 03:11:55,879
Take me as a servant,

2641
03:11:58,757 --> 03:12:00,675
as a slave.

2642
03:12:12,730 --> 03:12:14,522
Continue our life together,

2643
03:12:15,983 --> 03:12:19,569
even in your own way.

2644
03:12:29,538 --> 03:12:31,039
Forgive me.
