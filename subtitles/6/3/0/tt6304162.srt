00:22:43,074 --> 00:22:45,074
-My family isn't.

167
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:47,034
-Then who cares.

168
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:48,081
-Well, yeah.

169
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:56,024
Look, and where from do you know about this IT guy?

170
00:23:00,075 --> 00:23:02,056
-Well, first of all,

171
00:23:02,056 --> 00:23:04,056
he's not an IT guy.

172
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,002
I said it on purpose.

173
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:08,050
He's from a different department,

174
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,046
don't ask from which.

175
00:23:11,063 --> 00:23:13,024
Second of all,

176
00:23:15,035 --> 00:23:17,069
I know it from the source.

177
00:23:19,037 --> 00:23:20,080
Well, you got it.

178
00:23:22,008 --> 00:23:24,050
By the way,
I haven't talked to him for a long time,

179
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:25,070
lack of time.

180
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,072
Just

181
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,027
saying hello to each other, sometimes, from afar.

182
00:23:30,027 --> 00:23:32,027
-You won't tell anybody, right?

183
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,090
-Just like during a confession, don't worry.

184
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,090
-What do you think,
will there be the end of the world?

185
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,060
-For sure.

186
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:07,000
Will you hand me some material to work with?

187
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,060
Have anything?

188
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,060
God said we must share.

189
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,090
-Maybe I'll get something in the evening.

190
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,090
-This will a mutual benefit, don't worry.

191
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,076
-Mhm.

192
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,076
-Oh my...

193
00:24:22,063 --> 00:24:23,071
-He's worrying a lot.

194
00:24:23,071 --> 00:24:24,089
-Good, let him worry.

195
00:24:24,091 --> 00:24:25,099
-He's suffering, poor guy.

196
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:29,040
-Good. They all are masters at messing things up,
how about cleaning things?

197
00:24:29,046 --> 00:24:31,096
-You think he's worrying about the kid?

198
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:33,020
Yeah, right.

199
00:24:33,046 --> 00:24:36,046
Ha has loans from the bank, he's afraid of getting fired.

200
00:24:36,092 --> 00:24:40,072
You know, his boss is all so Orthodox, to the bone.

201
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:41,084
-A fundamentalist?

202
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:42,048
-Mhm.

203
00:24:42,072 --> 00:24:45,044
Has a huge beard while wearing a Brioni-costume.

204
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:46,069
-A glamorous guy?

205
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,084
-Indeed.

206
00:24:48,006 --> 00:24:50,066
He started an Orthodox shariah there.

207
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,058
You get a job only if you're married.

208
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:54,010
And baptized, of course.

209
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:56,098
And during our vacations we had a pilgrimage
all around the temples.

210
00:24:57,008 --> 00:24:59,018
-Yeah, I remember. On the other hand,

211
00:24:59,018 --> 00:25:00,074
it's kind of cool. Exoticism.

212
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:02,065
-Oh come on, it's so boring.

213
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:03,080
-Bend your leg, shall we.

214
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:05,050
-But he has a big salary for that.

215
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,032
So, as I see, he's really getting nervous.

216
00:25:08,088 --> 00:25:10,043
-You think he can really get fired?

217
00:25:10,043 --> 00:25:12,002
-The hell I know.

218
00:25:12,014 --> 00:25:13,016
I really hope.

219
00:25:13,034 --> 00:25:14,085
-And what about the alimony?

220
00:25:14,085 --> 00:25:16,002
-Ouch!

221
00:25:16,002 --> 00:25:17,020
Are you kidding me?

222
00:25:17,044 --> 00:25:19,005
-Hey, there's very little left, relax.

223
00:25:19,005 --> 00:25:20,066
My friend told me once

224
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:23,024
that her boss is fond of extreme sports.

225
00:25:23,024 --> 00:25:24,021
-Really?
-Yes.

226
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:27,064
So he's taking them to parachute or to canoe

227
00:25:27,064 --> 00:25:28,087
or to downhill-ski.

228
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,087
-Downhill-skiing is cool.

229
00:25:30,087 --> 00:25:31,090
-Well...

230
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,012
The knee of my friend broke,

231
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,006
so she had to wear a cast for half a year.

232
00:25:36,006 --> 00:25:37,013
Goodbye the ligament.

233
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:38,020
-Hardcore...

234
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:41,056
-So some of them started buying
certificates on the internet

235
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:43,071
about the heart condition
or the blood-pressure.

236
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:45,024
-And?
-Got fired.

237
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:48,032
-If you're ill, go to a hospital.
-Holy crap.

238
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,045
-So, the temples of yours,

239
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:53,010
those prayers - all that is still bearable.
Turn over.

240
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,025
-Well, I don't know. I think...

241
00:25:56,025 --> 00:25:58,097
Vacations mean summer, sunshine, a beach,

242
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,058
an all-inclusive hotel...

243
00:26:02,075 --> 00:26:05,012
-And what does your new boyfriend say about this?

244
00:26:05,012 --> 00:26:07,012
-He's fine with it.

245
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:08,095
He's so, you know, up-to-date.

246
00:26:08,095 --> 00:26:11,023
-Well, he has the money,

247
00:26:11,023 --> 00:26:13,023
he's healthy. Why not be up-to-date?

248
00:26:13,023 --> 00:26:15,002
-Knock on the wood...

249
00:26:15,002 --> 00:26:17,036
-Don't worry, I'm not a hoodoo.

250
00:26:17,036 --> 00:26:19,058
-I'm not superstitious, too, it was just a reflex.

251
00:26:19,058 --> 00:26:20,090
-So, is he divorced? Any kids?

252
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,090
-Yeah. Divorces 3 years ago.

253
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:25,034
The daughter is grown-up, she's studying abroad,

254
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:26,081
in Portugal, I think.

255
00:26:26,081 --> 00:26:27,090
And works there, too.

256
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,095
-And how old is he?

257
00:26:28,095 --> 00:26:30,027
-47.

258
00:26:30,074 --> 00:26:32,027
-He's looking good.

259
00:26:32,027 --> 00:26:34,002
-He does some Chinese exercises.

260
00:26:34,002 --> 00:26:36,002
Doesn't smoke, almost doesn't drink.

261
00:26:36,002 --> 00:26:38,065
-I'm even jealous.

262
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:41,023
So, I even it up?
 -Just a bit.

263
00:26:44,022 --> 00:26:46,022
-And how does he feel about your boy?

264
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:47,079
-Nothing particular.

265
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:50,018
Looks like this boy of mine hates me.

266
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:51,098
He's just like his father.

267
00:26:51,098 --> 00:26:54,028
Even starts to smell like him.

268
00:26:54,028 --> 00:26:56,070
-Secondary sexual characteristics,
he's growing up.

269
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,089
And did you want him to stay an angel
all the time?

270
00:26:58,089 --> 00:27:01,079
-He may look like an angel,
-Oh, hi, will you wait?

271
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,000
-But he's actually all so spiky,

272
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,090
he almost tore me during childbirth -
didn't want to get out.

273
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,097
I was delivering almost 24-hours.

274
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:12,016
-Yeah, the life is hard...

275
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:15,069
Just like my tyke.

276
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:18,019
Everytime I look at her I realize a sad fact

277
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:19,099
that she's just like her father.

278
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:21,099
I hope he died there in his Kapotnya.

279
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,092
-Look.

280
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:26,080
-Yeah...

281
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,085
But you know, she doesn't drink.

282
00:27:28,085 --> 00:27:31,044
I told her that I'll kill her immediately.

283
00:27:31,044 --> 00:27:33,044
She's a girl of a character.

284
00:27:33,044 --> 00:27:35,060
But not like her father, more like his mother.

285
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,075
She's such a bitch.

286
00:27:36,075 --> 00:27:38,038
-I forgot, how old is your daughter?

287
00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:40,072
-19, but she's real stupid.

288
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:42,034
Well no, she's smart,

289
00:27:42,034 --> 00:27:43,092
she finished the school, exams,

290
00:27:43,092 --> 00:27:46,095
but doesn't want to study anymore,
no matter what you do.

291
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:48,090
All she wants is to roam around.

292
00:27:49,018 --> 00:27:51,092
I tell her: "If you get pregnant, your life is ruined.

293
00:27:52,032 --> 00:27:54,060
Don't count on me". 
And she says: "I have safe sex".

294
00:27:54,078 --> 00:27:56,026
-Well, at least that.

295
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:58,066
-I don't know how she'll live further.

296
00:27:58,066 --> 00:28:01,083
No profession, no desire whatsoever.

297
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:04,040
I tell her: "Who do you want to be?" 
"A member of Parliament".

298
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,054
I say: "Study while you still have time".

299
00:28:07,026 --> 00:28:09,044
She says: "You don't need to study to be an MP".

300
00:28:09,044 --> 00:28:10,055
What can I say.

301
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,017
-So your daughter is clever!

302
00:28:12,017 --> 00:28:13,082
-It's because she's just like me.

303
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,082
-Yes?

304
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,082
-Zhenya, come downstairs, please.

305
00:28:31,082 --> 00:28:32,080
-Mhm.

306
00:28:56,008 --> 00:28:58,028
-Why you don't tell me anything?

307
00:28:58,048 --> 00:28:59,082
-What do you mean?

308
00:28:59,082 --> 00:29:03,018
-How did it go with the flat yesterday,
what did the buyers say?

309
00:29:03,044 --> 00:29:05,012
-They said they'll think.

310
00:29:05,092 --> 00:29:07,015
Eh, Masha,

311
00:29:07,015 --> 00:29:10,061
if there was any progress,
I would have certainly told you.

312
00:29:10,061 --> 00:29:12,061
-Why can't you sell it for all this time?

313
00:29:12,061 --> 00:29:14,099
Aren't you working in the Sales Department?

314
00:29:16,094 --> 00:29:19,094
-You realize that those are
different things, don't you?

315
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,071
-No, I don't.

316
00:29:21,071 --> 00:29:24,075
Don't take the pelmeni,
my mom said no pelmeni.

317
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:27,095
-Where's she tonight? At home?

318
00:29:28,052 --> 00:29:29,095
-Oh,

319
00:29:29,095 --> 00:29:31,055
she left for her auntie.

320
00:29:31,088 --> 00:29:33,055
I got tired of her myself.

321
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:35,060
Tonight we're alone.

322
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,010
-Thank God.

323
00:29:37,044 --> 00:29:39,098
-How can you say that? She's my mother!

324
00:29:40,056 --> 00:29:41,098
Hey, go take the broccoli.

325
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:51,055
-1275, please.

326
00:30:52,032 --> 00:30:53,034
-Borya.

327
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:54,075
Wait.

328
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:04,088
Everything is going to be alright with us, right?

329
00:34:07,074 --> 00:34:09,074
You won't leave us, right?

330
00:34:10,061 --> 00:34:11,058
-What?

331
00:34:12,074 --> 00:34:14,074
Masha...

332
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:17,000
Are you crazy?

333
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,032
Where do those thoughts come from?

334
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:22,044
-I just sometimes get so scared...

335
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:28,044
-I'm with you.

336
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:33,074
-You must have been saying the same
to your ex-wife.

337
00:34:37,036 --> 00:34:40,036
-Me and you, we are a completely
different story.

338
00:34:40,066 --> 00:34:43,036
There was no one who made me feel so happy.

339
00:34:47,009 --> 00:34:49,009
-And how many were there?

340
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,009
More than 10?

341
00:34:57,009 --> 00:34:59,009
-I'm quite hungry, what about you?

342
00:35:00,005 --> 00:35:02,061
-I'm always hungry these days.

343
00:35:03,032 --> 00:35:04,068
By the way, I feel offended.

344
00:35:04,094 --> 00:35:06,096
-I'll go cook something.

345
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:10,068
-Bring me an apple.

346
00:35:24,048 --> 00:35:25,078
-Catch it.

347
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:30,097
Boiled chicken and broccoli, huh?

348
00:35:30,097 --> 00:35:32,034
-I don't want.

349
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:35,013
I want a salad with cucumbers and tomatoes.

350
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:37,052
-Wow, a salad with cucumbers and tomatoes...

351
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:55,048
-"Got a tooth pulled in a dream. What does it mean?"

352
00:36:09,052 --> 00:36:11,052
-Hi!
-Hi.

353
00:36:11,052 --> 00:36:13,020
-Why are you so early?

354
00:36:13,052 --> 00:36:16,036
I was expecting you later,
I barely managed to get off work.

355
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,036
My girls didn't want me to leave.

356
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,010
There are still lots of customers.

357
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,077
So, where are we going?

358
00:36:23,032 --> 00:36:24,008
M?

359
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,085
Why are you silent?

360
00:36:25,085 --> 00:36:28,085
Come on and tell me where we are going
this time!

361
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,064
Look, can we first get a watermelon on the way?

362
00:36:45,062 --> 00:36:46,091
-Young lady,

363
00:36:46,091 --> 00:36:48,091
do you have a second to tell me your number?

364
00:36:48,091 --> 00:36:50,091
8-9... ?

365
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:52,091
-25

366
00:36:52,091 --> 00:36:55,036
160 78

367
00:36:55,036 --> 00:36:56,017
88.

368
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:57,056
-And your name?

369
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,004
-Sofia.

370
00:37:45,028 --> 00:37:48,019
-I can't eat when I'm observed like that.

371
00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:49,090
-Sorry.

372
00:37:51,074 --> 00:37:53,074
-Okay, I was kidding.

373
00:37:56,052 --> 00:37:58,052
-You got new hair cut, or is it just me?

374
00:37:59,052 --> 00:38:00,053
-You noticed.

375
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:01,056
-Of course.

376
00:38:02,021 --> 00:38:04,021
I'm looking closely at you.

377
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:06,021
-You still are?

378
00:38:07,005 --> 00:38:09,005
After all we've done?

379
00:38:12,026 --> 00:38:14,016
-Especially after all we've done.

380
00:38:17,002 --> 00:38:19,062
-After what we've done
the day before yesterday?

381
00:38:22,035 --> 00:38:24,075
Or the day before
the day before yesterday?

382
00:38:24,075 --> 00:38:25,029
-Zhenya...

383
00:38:26,081 --> 00:38:27,077
-What?

384
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:30,046
What's the matter?

385
00:38:31,052 --> 00:38:32,085
Something's wrong?

386
00:38:39,085 --> 00:38:42,025
[Voices in the background, suggesting to have a drink]

387
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,030
-Girls, let's drink for love!

388
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,094
For love!

389
00:38:45,094 --> 00:38:47,094
-You my beauties!

390
00:38:47,094 --> 00:38:49,094
Let's make a selfie!

391
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:52,036
-For love and selfie!

392
00:41:54,086 --> 00:41:56,036
You're asleep?

393
00:42:06,011 --> 00:42:08,011
It's not fair.

394
00:42:25,036 --> 00:42:27,000
I love you.

395
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,060
I never loved anyone.

396
00:42:41,036 --> 00:42:43,084
Only my mother when I was a child.

397
00:42:45,008 --> 00:42:47,038
And she was so blunt with me.

398
00:42:48,036 --> 00:42:50,036
Never caressed.

399
00:42:50,036 --> 00:42:52,076
Never said a kind word.

400
00:42:55,053 --> 00:42:58,090
Only the discipline, the order, the studying.

401
00:43:00,017 --> 00:43:02,056
Wicked and lonely wretch.

402
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:05,048
-She is alive and well, I hope?

403
00:43:06,054 --> 00:43:07,092
-Alive.

404
00:43:09,025 --> 00:43:11,094
And actually quite healthy.

405
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,060
We don't talk much.

406
00:43:19,075 --> 00:43:22,010
Every time I call we end up in a scandal.

407
00:43:22,031 --> 00:43:24,086
Even later on, I cannot understand why.

408
00:43:24,086 --> 00:43:26,086
Who started it.

409
00:43:45,096 --> 00:43:48,076
Only with you I realized what love is.

410
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:53,046
I didn't love my husband.

411
00:43:55,046 --> 00:43:57,046
And before him I had no one.

412
00:43:59,056 --> 00:44:02,020
And even with him, I got pregnant by mistake.

413
00:44:05,012 --> 00:44:08,012
He was so happy, suggested to get married.

414
00:44:08,087 --> 00:44:11,010
"Everything is fine, we're together".

415
00:44:12,054 --> 00:44:14,054
But I didn't want that.

416
00:44:17,044 --> 00:44:19,014
I was so scared.

417
00:44:23,044 --> 00:44:26,099
I was afraid to do the abortion,
I was afraid to keep it.

418
00:44:28,097 --> 00:44:31,071
Didn't want it so much.

419
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,076
When I was delivering I thought I was gonna die.

420
00:44:40,082 --> 00:44:42,041
They had me in critical care.

421
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:46,062
And then, when they brought him,

422
00:44:47,058 --> 00:44:49,090
I couldn't even look at him.

423
00:44:51,012 --> 00:44:53,046
Like some kind of disgust.

424
00:44:57,071 --> 00:44:59,071
I even didn't have milk.

425
00:45:12,088 --> 00:45:14,052
Later it somehow got better,

426
00:45:14,052 --> 00:45:16,050
some life started.

427
00:45:17,031 --> 00:45:18,096
Some.

428
00:45:20,065 --> 00:45:22,065
-Un-love.

429
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,095
-You can't live in un-love.

430
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,025
-Even now, when I look at him or think about him,

431
00:45:42,025 --> 00:45:44,025
like right now,

432
00:45:45,073 --> 00:45:49,022
it seems like I have made
some unforgivable mistake.

433
00:45:53,065 --> 00:45:55,065
I blame him and I blame myself.

434
00:46:01,065 --> 00:46:04,002
How much do I want to be happy!

435
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:11,019
I'm a bitch, ain't I?

436
00:46:11,058 --> 00:46:13,019
-Of course.

437
00:46:17,072 --> 00:46:20,086
You're the loveliest bitch in the world.

438
00:46:28,059 --> 00:46:30,059
-You really love me?

439
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:33,080
-Come to me.

440
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,007
-Yeah, hello.

441
00:50:15,007 --> 00:50:17,007
-Did you see Alyosha yesterday evening?

442
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:19,081
-No, I didn't come home last night. Why?

443
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,090
-The school called right now,

444
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:24,024
they said he wasn't there
neither today nor yesterday.

445
00:50:24,052 --> 00:50:25,090
-What do you mean?

446
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:27,044
And who called?

447
00:50:27,044 --> 00:50:28,092
-The head teacher.

448
00:50:31,037 --> 00:50:32,024
And what did she say?

449
00:50:32,047 --> 00:50:33,066
-That he wasn't there!

450
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:36,014
Neither today, nor yesterday! Are you deaf or what?

451
00:50:36,058 --> 00:50:37,044
-Had he been in at home?

452
00:50:37,044 --> 00:50:38,081
-I don't know!

453
00:50:40,081 --> 00:50:43,016
I came yesterday at night,
I thought he's sleeping.

454
00:50:43,016 --> 00:50:45,025
Woke up late today.

455
00:50:45,025 --> 00:50:47,050
I thought he's already left, as usually.

456
00:50:47,052 --> 00:50:49,058
His phone is off, has he called you?

457
00:50:52,084 --> 00:50:53,092
-Dear God...

458
00:50:54,056 --> 00:50:56,073
-Stop panicking, he'll come back,
what else will he do.

459
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,098
We need to call that...

460
00:50:58,098 --> 00:51:00,036
the friend of his.

461
00:51:00,036 --> 00:51:01,092
-I already have, he hadn't seen him either.

462
00:51:01,092 --> 00:51:03,026
Neither today, nor yesterday.

463
00:51:04,056 --> 00:51:05,052
-I see.

464
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,084
And where are you now?

465
00:51:08,084 --> 00:51:10,050
-At home, where else.

466
00:51:10,084 --> 00:51:13,068
-And you fuckin cannot understand if he
had been home or not?

467
00:51:13,068 --> 00:51:15,017
-I damn cannot!

468
00:51:15,017 --> 00:51:16,020
-Why?

469
00:51:16,054 --> 00:51:17,070
It's easy.

470
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,046
-Then come and see yourself!

471
00:51:22,046 --> 00:51:24,046
-I'm at work, in case you didn't know.

472
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:26,092
-We haven't heard of him
for more than 24-hours,

473
00:51:27,008 --> 00:51:28,014
do you get this or not?

474
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:32,034
-Maybe he's in the elevator
right now, for example.

475
00:51:33,055 --> 00:51:35,055
I think you're exaggerating.

476
00:51:36,066 --> 00:51:37,077
He must have done something

477
00:51:37,077 --> 00:51:39,099
and is afraid now that
you'll give him a beating.

478
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:41,099
That's why he's roaming around somewhere...

479
00:51:42,087 --> 00:51:44,087
-So, I'm at fault now, right?

480
00:51:46,035 --> 00:51:47,057
-You even...

481
00:51:47,057 --> 00:51:50,096
You don't even know if he had been at home or not.

482
00:51:53,036 --> 00:51:55,036
He probably had.

483
00:51:57,036 --> 00:51:58,033
Hello?

484
00:52:02,033 --> 00:52:03,007
Hello?

485
00:52:04,001 --> 00:52:05,047
-Listen.

486
00:52:05,098 --> 00:52:07,098
I'm calling the police right now,

487
00:52:07,098 --> 00:52:09,085
and you can keep sitting at your work

488
00:52:09,085 --> 00:52:11,088
and speculate what may had been
and what may not.

489
00:52:11,088 --> 00:52:12,083
Got it?

490
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:14,012
Blockhead!

491
00:52:40,084 --> 00:52:42,000
-Dasha, look,

492
00:52:42,047 --> 00:52:44,047
one office worker

493
00:52:44,047 --> 00:52:46,047
says to another office worker:

494
00:52:46,047 --> 00:52:48,047
"What car do you have?"

495
00:52:48,047 --> 00:52:50,011
"Volkswagen Passat"

496
00:52:50,011 --> 00:52:51,063
"And I have Volkswagen Credit"

497
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,080
-So funny.

498
00:52:55,053 --> 00:52:56,075
-Look,

499
00:52:56,075 --> 00:52:57,087
one office worker...

500
00:52:57,087 --> 00:52:59,087
-Wait wait wait, Seryozha...

501
00:53:02,073 --> 00:53:03,075
-It was funny.

502
00:53:39,035 --> 00:53:40,052
-I've finished.

503
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,089
-Good, thank you.

504
00:53:42,089 --> 00:53:44,089
Take that.

505
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:51,010
Wait for me in the car,
we have one more call.

506
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:52,003
-Okay.

507
00:53:53,007 --> 00:53:54,070
-What can I say.

508
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,040
I see no crime here.

509
00:53:57,022 --> 00:53:58,060
-What crime?

510
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:00,082
-You know, sometimes

511
00:54:00,082 --> 00:54:02,067
the parents finish off their child

512
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:04,067
and then claim that the child got lost.

513
00:54:05,032 --> 00:54:06,098
-You thought that way about me?

514
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,071
-That's the version we check the first.

515
00:54:10,012 --> 00:54:11,077
Here we have a "runner", the usual case.

516
00:54:11,077 --> 00:54:13,032
12 years old, a rebel-heart,

517
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:14,076
full of hormones.

518
00:54:14,076 --> 00:54:17,055
He'll roam around for a couple of days
and will come back.

519
00:54:18,008 --> 00:54:20,008
Well, we can, of course, go to the Department,

520
00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:22,071
spend a couple of hours filling a detailed form -

521
00:54:22,071 --> 00:54:24,071
and probably already not today.

522
00:54:25,038 --> 00:54:28,001
At least because your husband
must be present as well.

523
00:54:29,007 --> 00:54:30,048
And even then,

524
00:54:30,098 --> 00:54:34,013
I think this case won't go further
than the material checking.

525
00:54:37,097 --> 00:54:39,097
-You say there's no crime.

526
00:54:41,029 --> 00:54:43,029
And what if he was kidnapped?

527
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,090
Cause I can't even imagine

528
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:46,012
where he can be now.

529
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,087
-He must be roaming somewhere around the block.

530
00:54:48,087 --> 00:54:50,087
He won't last long.

531
00:54:50,087 --> 00:54:53,063
He's used to the comfort, and it's right here.

532
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:57,040
They come back to such families
that you couldn't even imagine.

533
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,077
Cause the street is not a home,
no matter how shitty the latter is.

534
00:55:00,084 --> 00:55:02,084
And considering the kidnapping,

535
00:55:02,084 --> 00:55:04,056
This is how it goes:

536
00:55:04,056 --> 00:55:06,056
First, there's the material checking. It means:

537
00:55:06,056 --> 00:55:09,021
Examining the parents, relatives,

538
00:55:09,021 --> 00:55:11,085
friends, possible witnesses and so on.

539
00:55:11,085 --> 00:55:13,040
We don't have enough staff for it.

540
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,040
Plus, there are a lot of other cases -

541
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,026
robberies, murders, burglaries, thuggery.

542
00:55:19,044 --> 00:55:22,012
Thus, collecting materials can last
a couple of days.

543
00:55:22,012 --> 00:55:25,000
If by then the "runner" doesn't come back,

544
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,049
the searching operations begin.

545
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:30,011
And if during them we find reasons,

546
00:55:30,011 --> 00:55:33,051
i.e. factual evidence of murder or kidnapping,

547
00:55:33,051 --> 00:55:35,089
then criminal proceedings are initiated.

548
00:55:35,089 --> 00:55:38,041
But it is initiated by
the investigating committee.

549
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:41,014
You know yourself, how long can it take.

550
00:55:41,077 --> 00:55:43,077
The writing itself takes forever.

551
00:55:43,077 --> 00:55:45,039
During this time they usually

552
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:46,089
come back and run away again.

553
00:55:47,012 --> 00:55:48,089
-So, you won't do anything, right?

554
00:55:48,091 --> 00:55:52,001
-Ma'am, I'm explaining the real situation.

555
00:55:52,001 --> 00:55:54,060
We must react and we will.

556
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,011
But in this particular case

557
00:55:56,011 --> 00:55:59,057
we physically don't have time or staff
to keep chasing every teenager.

558
00:55:59,082 --> 00:56:01,010
-I got it.

559
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:03,099
The case will be thrown to a trash-bin, right?

560
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:05,054
And what do I do?

561
00:56:05,054 --> 00:56:07,054
Just sit and wait till he returns?

562
00:56:07,054 --> 00:56:09,026
And what if he doesn't return?

563
00:56:09,048 --> 00:56:11,026
-Facts are stubborn things...

564
00:56:11,026 --> 00:56:12,086
In most cases

565
00:56:12,086 --> 00:56:15,077
the teenage "runners" come back
in a week' s time,

566
00:56:15,077 --> 00:56:17,077
in 10 days at most.

567
00:56:19,012 --> 00:56:20,083
What I can advise is,

568
00:56:20,083 --> 00:56:22,098
If you really want to start looking for him,

569
00:56:22,098 --> 00:56:24,035
go to the internet,

570
00:56:24,035 --> 00:56:27,028
to the web-page of the search-and-rescue squad,

571
00:56:28,016 --> 00:56:29,098
call them, give them all the information,

572
00:56:29,098 --> 00:56:32,031
they'll tell which information they need.

573
00:56:32,031 --> 00:56:35,006
They are volunteers, not a government service.

574
00:56:35,052 --> 00:56:38,042
They work 24-hours, for free,

575
00:56:38,042 --> 00:56:40,082
without any bureaucracy,

576
00:56:40,082 --> 00:56:43,076
A well-developed highly-efficient
algorithm of actions.

577
00:56:44,028 --> 00:56:47,060
Where do I know from?
Have been collaborating, productively.

578
00:56:49,001 --> 00:56:51,068
Look, here's my card.

579
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:54,099
Your phone number

580
00:56:54,099 --> 00:56:57,063
has already been written down,
we'll stay in touch.

581
00:56:58,098 --> 00:57:00,098
-For now, yes.

582
00:57:01,087 --> 00:57:03,002
-Unreal.

583
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,074
-Listen.

584
00:57:04,074 --> 00:57:07,028
If it were any other officer,

585
00:57:07,028 --> 00:57:10,000
it would have been
much harsher and less informative.

586
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And it's not because I'm so kind.

587
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:15,024
It's because I save my time, yours
and volunteers'.

588
00:57:15,024 --> 00:57:17,055
Who will start searching

589
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,075
the sooner you contact them.

590
00:57:18,075 --> 00:57:23,045
And they will find your fool
somewhere in the streets or in a mall.

591
00:57:23,045 --> 00:57:25,066
And most probably, at some place of his friend's,

592
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:28,093
whose parents went away for a day or two
so that he's alone now.

593
00:57:29,062 --> 00:57:31,001
So, take actions.

594
00:57:31,001 --> 00:57:34,024
Or keep waiting, it's up to you.

595
00:58:32,081 --> 00:58:34,081
-When have you spoken to him last time?

596
00:58:34,081 --> 00:58:37,040
-I just saw him leaving for school.

597
00:58:38,033 --> 00:58:40,033
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

598
00:58:40,066 --> 00:58:42,010
-I'm sorry, there are traffic jams.

599
00:58:42,077 --> 00:58:45,052
-Take a seat, engage yourself,
my name's Ivan,

600
00:58:45,052 --> 00:58:48,017
I'm the coordinator
of the search-and-rescue squad.

601
00:58:48,017 --> 00:58:50,044
-Yes, my wife told me on the phone.

602
00:58:50,044 --> 00:58:53,029
-Great. Then, let's start. I mean, continue.

603
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:57,005
So, I say it one more time
so that there are fewer questions.

604
00:58:57,005 --> 00:58:59,080
Now I'm going to carefully ask you
about your son, Alyosha,

605
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:03,046
while other searchers are surveying
the neighbours, possible witnesses,

606
00:59:03,048 --> 00:59:06,074
on the streets, in the shops,
everywhere where he could have been seen.

607
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:07,057
Yes, Lena?

608
00:59:07,057 --> 00:59:09,005
-The neighbours got nothing.

609
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:12,033
-Nobody has seen him, neither yesterday, nor today.

610
00:59:12,038 --> 00:59:13,037
They can't remember.

611
00:59:13,095 --> 00:59:16,035
There are more of us now, in the parking place.

612
00:59:16,035 --> 00:59:18,032
-Good.
-And we have the posters now.

613
00:59:18,032 --> 00:59:20,008
-Oh, got printed? Good job.

614
00:59:20,008 --> 00:59:21,037
-I'll continue with the neighbours.

615
00:59:21,037 --> 00:59:23,010
-Keep surveying.

616
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:25,056
Right.

617
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:28,035
Depending on the results of the survey,

618
00:59:28,035 --> 00:59:30,083
we'll focus on particular objects and tasks.

619
00:59:30,083 --> 00:59:33,026
We finish with you now
and to to the police department.

620
00:59:33,026 --> 00:59:35,003
Your detective officer promised

621
00:59:35,003 --> 00:59:37,093
to help out with the security cam footage.

622
00:59:37,093 --> 00:59:40,069
It's very important and it may help us a lot.

623
00:59:40,069 --> 00:59:42,013
Next.

624
00:59:42,013 --> 00:59:45,013
Since the night is coming,
the guy needs to sleep somewhere.

625
00:59:45,013 --> 00:59:46,092
It's not summer outside.

626
00:59:46,092 --> 00:59:48,049
We'll search the doorways.

627
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:52,097
We'll ask the same officer for the door-codes,
hopefully he won't refuse.

628
00:59:53,043 --> 00:59:56,019
So. From the very beginning.

629
00:59:56,076 --> 00:59:58,027
Alyosha Sleptsov.

630
00:59:58,027 --> 00:59:59,056
12 years old,

631
00:59:59,056 --> 01:00:02,024
around 1 m 50 cm tall.

632
01:00:02,024 --> 01:00:04,069
Healthy, no specific marks.

633
01:00:04,069 --> 01:00:06,011
Blond hair.

634
01:00:06,011 --> 01:00:09,043
was wearing blue jeans,
a red jacket with a hoodie,

635
01:00:09,043 --> 01:00:10,085
blue sneakers.

636
01:00:10,085 --> 01:00:13,059
Had a blue schoolbag.

637
01:00:14,008 --> 01:00:18,081
Left the house yesterday, as usually.
Hasn't come back since, as it seems.

638
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:22,016
The mobile phone is off
but we keep calling nevertheless.

639
01:00:23,076 --> 01:00:25,053
Got it. Next.

640
01:00:25,053 --> 01:00:28,036
Tell me, what kind of hobbies does the boy have?

641
01:00:28,036 --> 01:00:31,097
Any sport clubs, maybe planning to go
building a spaceport,

642
01:00:31,097 --> 01:00:33,080
traveling around the world and so on.

643
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:36,097
-No, nothing like that,
doesn't do sports.

644
01:00:36,097 --> 01:00:39,028
I think, he sits at home usually.

645
01:00:39,028 --> 01:00:41,028
-"You think"? I see.

646
01:00:41,028 --> 01:00:43,028
If so, then he has a computer?

647
01:00:43,084 --> 01:00:45,036
Is his laptop on the table?
-Yes.

648
01:00:45,036 --> 01:00:48,014
-Yeah, we're trying to limit the...
-Especially you do.

649
01:00:48,014 --> 01:00:52,011
-Look, you can discuss your relations later, okay?
-Yes, sorry.

650
01:00:52,011 --> 01:00:54,041
-Have you got the access to the computer?
-Yes.

651
01:00:54,042 --> 01:00:57,053
-Get the access to his e-mail, to the accounts
in the social networks,

652
01:00:57,053 --> 01:01:00,059
addresses of his friends, girlfriends, buddies.

653
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:02,008
-He has only one friend.

654
01:01:02,056 --> 01:01:04,008
Kuznetsov, I think.

655
01:01:04,008 --> 01:01:06,008
-Mhm.

656
01:01:06,008 --> 01:01:08,008
"You think", again? Alright.

657
01:01:08,008 --> 01:01:10,008
-I have all his logins and passwords,

658
01:01:10,008 --> 01:01:12,008
he really has only one friend - Kuznetsov,

659
01:01:12,008 --> 01:01:14,052
in real life, I mean.

660
01:01:15,012 --> 01:01:17,079
In the social networks...
-Yeah, I got it.

661
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:20,094
Okay. The closest relatives where he could go to?

662
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:24,012
Grannies, grandpas, uncles, ants, cousins?

663
01:01:24,012 --> 01:01:26,094
-My husband has none, I have a mother
she lives in the Moscow region.

664
01:01:26,094 --> 01:01:29,052
-We haven't been there for 3 years,
I don't think the brat remembers.

665
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:32,000
-"The brat"? I see.

666
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,016
I hope you called the granny
and she said he's not there?

667
01:01:35,016 --> 01:01:36,064
-No, I can't reach her.

668
01:01:36,064 --> 01:01:38,054
You know, our relations are very...

669
01:01:38,054 --> 01:01:40,054
-What do you mean, you can't reach her?

670
01:01:40,054 --> 01:01:43,055
-She wasn't answering at first
 then became out of reach.

671
01:01:43,055 --> 01:01:44,075
The phone-line is quite bad there.

672
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:46,075
-The phone-line is good, the woman is quite insane.

673
01:01:46,075 --> 01:01:50,005
-Mm. The granny with a spirit?
-Mhm.

674
01:01:50,005 --> 01:01:51,043
-Did you call the neighbours?

675
01:01:51,043 --> 01:01:53,007
-No, I have no phone number.

676
01:01:53,007 --> 01:01:56,051
-It's her house, her area, the neighbours...

677
01:01:57,010 --> 01:01:59,066
It's better to stay away, or else...
-What if she's hiding

678
01:01:59,072 --> 01:02:02,084
that Alyosha is there,
if he asks her to do so, for example.

679
01:02:02,084 --> 01:02:04,026
-No, I don't think so.

680
01:02:04,065 --> 01:02:06,098
-She can do anything,
she's a female Stalin.

681
01:02:06,098 --> 01:02:08,025
-Enough!

682
01:02:08,025 --> 01:02:10,011
We went there only by car,
How is he gonna get there?

683
01:02:10,011 --> 01:02:12,011
-What if she'd been secretly
communicating with him?

684
01:02:12,011 --> 01:02:14,030
Ain't it possible?
-She doesn't love him!

685
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:17,085
-Loves, doesn't love. She used him
as a tool against me.

686
01:02:17,085 --> 01:02:20,071
-Look, we must go to your granny urgently.

687
01:02:20,071 --> 01:02:22,036
Where exactly does she live?

688
01:02:22,036 --> 01:02:23,095
-In a summer house, all the time.

689
01:02:23,095 --> 01:02:25,029
Kiev direction.

690
01:02:25,029 --> 01:02:26,086
It's not easy to explain,

691
01:02:26,086 --> 01:02:28,086
there's a small side-road from the highway.

692
01:02:28,086 --> 01:02:30,059
-But you're with a car?
-Yes.

693
01:02:30,059 --> 01:02:31,099
-How long till there?

694
01:02:31,099 --> 01:02:34,043
-Around 3 hours, maybe 2,5.

695
01:02:34,043 --> 01:02:36,002
-Here's what we do.

696
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:38,037
You give me all the contacts
of his friends and fellows,

697
01:02:38,037 --> 01:02:41,015
including the phone of the head teacher.

698
01:02:41,051 --> 01:02:43,015
I hope you have it?

699
01:02:43,015 --> 01:02:46,011
-We do... 
-Great, also all the logins and passwords.

700
01:02:46,011 --> 01:02:51,000
I take the computer with me to the headquarters.
After that, we act according to the situation.

701
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,020
Meanwhile you... Is it the head teacher's?

702
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,082
Good.

703
01:02:55,082 --> 01:02:58,095
Meanwhile, you two jump into the car

704
01:02:58,095 --> 01:03:01,060
and head to your wonderful granny.

705
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:04,040
Lena joins you, you saw her.
She's our experienced searcher.

706
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,086
She'll be behind you, she has a car.

707
01:03:06,086 --> 01:03:09,056
On the way, try reaching the granny nevertheless.

708
01:03:09,068 --> 01:03:12,047
When you arrive, inspect everything carefully,
don't miss anything.

709
01:03:12,047 --> 01:03:15,061
Report me the results immediately,
no matter what they are.

710
01:03:15,061 --> 01:03:16,072
Understood? 
-Yes.

711
01:03:16,072 --> 01:03:18,005
-Will you manage?

712
01:03:18,005 --> 01:03:20,005
Any questions?

713
01:03:20,038 --> 01:03:24,067
We'll leave someone here at the flat,
in case the boy comes back.

714
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,057
So, shall we start?

715
01:03:27,057 --> 01:03:29,002
Let's go!

716
01:03:44,034 --> 01:03:45,077
-Damn you...

717
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:48,088
Can you switch that off, my head aches!

718
01:03:48,088 --> 01:03:50,064
-There's a pill in the glove compartment.

719
01:03:50,064 --> 01:03:52,084
-Switch off! Please!

720
01:04:05,095 --> 01:04:07,036
You think he's at her place?

721
01:04:07,036 --> 01:04:10,000
-Where else? Think about it.

722
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:19,088
What a mess has he made...

723
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:22,003
Chose a good time, little shit.

724
01:04:22,003 --> 01:04:25,082
-What if something horrible happened to him?
-Let's not even think this way.

725
01:04:26,082 --> 01:04:28,082
He's completely alright.

726
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:32,099
Just wait, he'll get what he deserves.

727
01:04:34,058 --> 01:04:36,036
You can't smoke here.

728
01:04:36,036 --> 01:04:38,036
-How could I forget.

729
01:04:38,036 --> 01:04:40,036
I'll smoke out of the window.
-I said don't!

730
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:44,074
-What will you do? Throw me onto the road?

731
01:04:45,085 --> 01:04:47,085
-So, your head stopped aching, right?

732
01:04:49,036 --> 01:04:50,071
-Raise the windows.

733
01:04:52,099 --> 01:04:55,019
Raise the windows!

734
01:04:58,066 --> 01:05:00,008
Bitch!

735
01:05:02,012 --> 01:05:04,064
Raise the goddamned windows!

736
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:07,000
AAA!!

737
01:05:51,046 --> 01:05:52,058
-Wow.

738
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
They've put the gates.

739
01:05:55,022 --> 01:05:57,050
What are we supposed to do?
To ram into them?

740
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:00,062
She must be constructing barricades there.

741
01:07:00,062 --> 01:07:02,001
-Stop making a monster out of her.

742
01:07:02,001 --> 01:07:03,043
-Is there another way in?

743
01:07:03,043 --> 01:07:05,043
-Except over the fence.

744
01:07:06,029 --> 01:07:08,001
-We don't have the keys.

745
01:07:08,001 --> 01:07:09,021
-Got it.

746
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:13,032
-Where did she...

747
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,034
-Mom!

748
01:07:38,078 --> 01:07:40,093
Mom, open up, it's me!

749
01:07:44,036 --> 01:07:45,054
Mom!

750
01:07:50,094 --> 01:07:51,084
Mom!

751
01:07:56,026 --> 01:07:57,084
-She's inside.

752
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:02,043
-Mom, open up, Alyosha is missing.

753
01:08:04,043 --> 01:08:06,043
-Dear Lord,

754
01:08:07,032 --> 01:08:09,026
Almost had a heart attack.

755
01:08:09,026 --> 01:08:10,087
First they call

756
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:13,050
in the middle of the night,
like during a fire,

757
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:15,050
then I see them climbing over the fence!

758
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:18,055
Oh Lord, God save us all...

759
01:08:18,055 --> 01:08:20,055
That can drive anyone crazy!

760
01:08:20,055 --> 01:08:23,005
And most importantly,
I cannot find my phone.

761
01:08:26,004 --> 01:08:28,004
How can I survive!

762
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:31,060
You could have warned, at least!

763
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:34,016
-I kept calling all day, don't tell me you didn't hear.

764
01:08:34,016 --> 01:08:35,048
-I swear!

765
01:08:35,066 --> 01:08:37,065
-First, you didn't answer, then switched it off.

766
01:08:37,065 --> 01:08:40,095
-I'm telling you, I don't know where it is!
Must have lost it somewhere.

767
01:08:40,095 --> 01:08:43,050
Cannot find it since morning. Well, screw it!

768
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:46,020
You better tell me, my dear,

769
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:48,086
why have you decided
that your kiddo is at my place, huh?

770
01:08:55,096 --> 01:08:58,052
-He's not here. Feels like he has never been.

771
01:08:58,052 --> 01:09:00,008
-We'll check everything.

772
01:09:20,081 --> 01:09:22,044
-Where is he wandering?

773
01:09:22,044 --> 01:09:25,010
Your goddamned dickwad. God bless us all...

774
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:27,010
You said you're divorcing, didn't you?

775
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,096
-You curse and pray in the same package...

776
01:09:29,096 --> 01:09:32,090
-What? In what package?

777
01:09:34,001 --> 01:09:35,091
In what package?

778
01:09:35,091 --> 01:09:37,091
What are you blabbering?!

779
01:09:38,043 --> 01:09:40,064
Are you completely nuts?

780
01:09:40,064 --> 01:09:42,064
Got so clever, huh?

781
01:09:42,064 --> 01:09:44,005
Don't shake your head to me!

782
01:09:44,005 --> 01:09:46,068
You're talking to you mother, by the way!
Have respect!

783
01:09:46,068 --> 01:09:49,000
And if you don't like something -
be off!

784
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,031
I didn't invite you here.

785
01:09:51,071 --> 01:09:53,048
Look at her...

786
01:09:53,048 --> 01:09:55,015
Why did I even give birth?..

787
01:09:55,015 --> 01:09:57,029
Just look at yourself: how do you look right now?

788
01:09:57,029 --> 01:09:59,071
-How?
-Like a wh*re!

789
01:09:59,071 --> 01:10:02,083
-Mom...
-Mom what? Want a breast? Here!

790
01:10:03,014 --> 01:10:04,083
"Mommy, oh mommy"...

791
01:10:09,013 --> 01:10:12,031
Oh? Oh?

792
01:10:12,031 --> 01:10:15,017
What, searched everything? Not here?

793
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:18,018
How could you even think about this.

794
01:10:21,056 --> 01:10:23,056
No battery. Of course.

795
01:10:24,031 --> 01:10:26,092
Of course there's no battery, where was it?

796
01:10:27,018 --> 01:10:29,016
-Was lying under you bed.

797
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:31,016
-Must have fallen, then.

798
01:10:31,016 --> 01:10:33,016
Thank God, it was found.

799
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:35,066
Well, let's have some tea, then.

800
01:10:35,066 --> 01:10:37,077
Although I don't have anything sweet,
just the honey.

801
01:10:37,077 --> 01:10:39,082
Became all hard over time...
-No thanks, mom.

802
01:10:39,082 --> 01:10:42,044
We'll go.
-Oh how polite she is, just look at her.

803
01:10:44,019 --> 01:10:46,095
You two don't even seem very upset.

804
01:10:46,095 --> 01:10:48,095
"Alyosha is missing!"

805
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:51,027
You're lying, aren't you?

806
01:10:51,027 --> 01:10:53,027
To make me sympathize?

807
01:10:53,027 --> 01:10:55,027
You chose the wrong person.

808
01:10:55,027 --> 01:10:57,027
I see right through you.

809
01:10:58,053 --> 01:11:00,043
You said you're divorcing.

810
01:11:00,043 --> 01:11:03,020
Decided to hand you b*stard to me?

811
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:05,020
Seen this?

812
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:08,008
I told you back them and am telling right now:
I won't babysit him!

813
01:11:08,008 --> 01:11:09,053
-Do you even talk to anyone except the TV?

814
01:11:09,053 --> 01:11:12,034
-And when you were big-bellied,
do you remember what I was telling you?

815
01:11:12,053 --> 01:11:14,030
"Change you mind, dear, change your mind!"

816
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:17,011
And what did you tell me to do, remember?
Well, I remember.

817
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:19,031
I told you you will come crawling to me

818
01:11:19,031 --> 01:11:22,004
but it will be too late. And here you go.

819
01:11:22,004 --> 01:11:24,004
Now it's your problem.

820
01:11:24,004 --> 01:11:27,021
A good lesson for you.
-Mom, what are you talking?

821
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:29,029
Have shame, there's a stranger in the room...

822
01:11:29,029 --> 01:11:31,085
-Don't teach me. Why did you start teaching me?

823
01:11:31,085 --> 01:11:34,059
Why should I be ashamed?
I'm in my house, by the way.

824
01:11:34,059 --> 01:11:37,055
Look at them! Trying to make a fool of me!

825
01:11:37,055 --> 01:11:39,055
Brought their asses in the middle of the night,

826
01:11:39,055 --> 01:11:43,010
just like thieves, 
brought some valuator with them -

827
01:11:44,004 --> 01:11:46,025
and I won't leave my house to you!

828
01:11:46,025 --> 01:11:48,025
Do you hear me? Don't even think about it!

829
01:11:48,025 --> 01:11:51,021
I'll give everything to God! That's it!

830
01:11:51,021 --> 01:11:52,072
I have nothing to offer to eat,

831
01:11:52,072 --> 01:11:54,055
all I have is a pension...
-Okay, let's go.

832
01:11:54,055 --> 01:11:56,055
-...you don't even care about me...

833
01:11:56,055 --> 01:11:58,052
-Okay, mom, we'll go.
-...and I don't need your care!

834
01:11:58,052 --> 01:11:59,098
-Let's go...
-Oh dear Lord...

835
01:11:59,098 --> 01:12:02,040
Won't even come to my funerals...
-We'll come, worry not.

836
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,049
F*ck you!

837
01:12:35,049 --> 01:12:37,049
-Where are we? Is there much left?

838
01:12:38,002 --> 01:12:39,093
-Around 40 minutes, I think.

839
01:12:45,093 --> 01:12:47,093
Her paranoia is only progressing with time...

840
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:51,045
So much hate... It's crazy.

841
01:12:51,045 --> 01:12:53,045
-You think you're full of love?

842
01:12:54,017 --> 01:12:56,001
-Why do you defend her?

843
01:12:56,001 --> 01:12:58,044
-Cause she's right.
-In what?

844
01:12:58,075 --> 01:13:01,022
In saying that you can't wait till she dies?

845
01:13:01,022 --> 01:13:03,022
-Watch your tongue.

846
01:13:07,022 --> 01:13:09,061
She's right in saying
that I shouldn't get involved with you,

847
01:13:09,061 --> 01:13:11,088
shouldn't give birth, shouldn't be so foolish.

848
01:13:12,072 --> 01:13:15,063
But I listened to you.

849
01:13:17,012 --> 01:13:19,096
"Everything's fine, we're together"
Explain to me now,

850
01:13:20,051 --> 01:13:23,031
how did it happen that you were promising love

851
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:25,031
and happiness,

852
01:13:25,031 --> 01:13:28,006
and as a result I've had
only pain and disappointment.

853
01:13:29,075 --> 01:13:32,036
Impenetrable ass full of shit.

854
01:13:44,093 --> 01:13:47,061
I never even loved you.

855
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:53,008
I just couldn't live with her any longer.

856
01:13:58,009 --> 01:14:00,030
And couldn't get unstuck from her either.

857
01:14:01,077 --> 01:14:04,032
I could with you.

858
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:08,066
I used you.

859
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,017
As I thought.

860
01:14:11,017 --> 01:14:13,026
In reality, you used me.

861
01:14:13,026 --> 01:14:15,026
You needed a family, not I.

862
01:14:15,026 --> 01:14:17,067
I could have managed without it, really.

863
01:14:22,065 --> 01:14:25,038
I just should have start
to live on my own somewhere.

864
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:30,086
But I got pregnant.

865
01:14:32,086 --> 01:14:34,086
That's when I got depressed.

866
01:14:37,092 --> 01:14:40,052
I shouldn't have listened to you,
should have made an abortion.

867
01:14:40,052 --> 01:14:41,042
-Yeah, you should have.

868
01:14:41,042 --> 01:14:43,046
It would have been better for all of us.

869
01:14:43,046 --> 01:14:46,020
-Oh really? And what would have changed?

870
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:48,020
Would you have changed?

871
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:51,052
Haven't you made big-bellied another young fool,
with pulling her into your hell?

872
01:14:52,049 --> 01:14:54,030
In 10-12 years, if you still get a boner,

873
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:56,070
you'll perform this trick once more, I'm sure.

874
01:14:59,012 --> 01:15:01,060
Poor girl, I even pity her.

875
01:15:06,036 --> 01:15:08,072
You ruined my life, do you get this?

876
01:15:14,029 --> 01:15:16,034
Thank God, I met a decent man,

877
01:15:16,034 --> 01:15:18,021
who doesn't need anything from me,

878
01:15:18,021 --> 01:15:20,021
except for me myself.

879
01:15:22,044 --> 01:15:25,011
What happened? We broke down?
-Yeah, we broke down.

880
01:15:25,011 --> 01:15:26,083
-Get out.
-No, seriously.

881
01:15:26,083 --> 01:15:28,083
-I'm serious. Get the f*ck out!

882
01:15:30,083 --> 01:15:32,083
Get out while I didn't kick you out with my legs.

883
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:35,085
-Go on, what else haven't you done with me, ***!

884
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:39,063
Don't forget that your son got missing, jerk!

885
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,063
-Let's keep the line!

886
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,042
Stay close!

887
01:18:17,046 --> 01:18:19,046
-Fox 1, doing the calling.

888
01:18:21,062 --> 01:18:28,083
Aaa-lyooo-shaaa!

889
01:18:33,086 --> 01:18:40,084
Aaa-lyooo-shaaa!

890
01:18:43,042 --> 01:18:51,022
Aaa-lyooo-shaaa!

891
01:18:59,022 --> 01:19:01,022
Fox 1, the calling finished.

892
01:19:01,022 --> 01:19:03,022
Let's go, guys.

893
01:19:56,076 --> 01:19:58,024
-This is it.

894
01:19:58,076 --> 01:20:00,076
-Can you do it one more time?

895
01:20:03,089 --> 01:20:05,090
-He's not there on the other cameras.

896
01:20:06,053 --> 01:20:08,061
Neither on the way to school, nor to the mall,

897
01:20:08,064 --> 01:20:10,050
to which they all go
as if there's a magnet there.

898
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:12,054
-Well, there's food and it looks nice.

899
01:20:12,054 --> 01:20:15,033
-Nor on the way to the bus or the route-taxi.

900
01:20:15,033 --> 01:20:19,071
If he wanted to go towards the metro
and then to the train station, for example,

901
01:20:19,071 --> 01:20:21,071
the options are:

902
01:20:23,002 --> 01:20:25,056
either he turned
where there are no street cameras -

903
01:20:25,056 --> 01:20:27,056
and there are a lot of such places -

904
01:20:27,056 --> 01:20:30,053
or he chose to walk so that he avoids them,

905
01:20:30,053 --> 01:20:32,053
which is unlikely.

906
01:20:32,053 --> 01:20:34,053
Or he was taken.

907
01:20:34,088 --> 01:20:36,059
-What do you mean, taken?

908
01:20:37,059 --> 01:20:39,024
-Kidnapped.

909
01:20:41,024 --> 01:20:43,024
-Are you serious?..

910
01:20:43,095 --> 01:20:46,002
-You don't joke about such things.

911
01:20:48,002 --> 01:20:50,002
-It is impossible.

912
01:20:50,002 --> 01:20:52,073
-Unfortunately, sometimes it is.
And what do you have?

913
01:20:54,057 --> 01:20:56,057
-Yesterday's survey was useless.

914
01:20:56,057 --> 01:20:59,095
It took a long time, according to us.

915
01:20:59,095 --> 01:21:01,095
You should initiate a investigating case.

916
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,020
Maybe even a criminal one.
-Excuse me.

917
01:21:05,073 --> 01:21:09,038
-We handed out the posters,
to emergencies and shops,

918
01:21:09,050 --> 01:21:11,078
to the kiosks...
-Hello?

919
01:21:11,088 --> 01:21:13,076
-Darling, I missed you.

920
01:21:13,076 --> 01:21:15,076
Will you come tonight? You promised.

921
01:21:15,076 --> 01:21:17,099
-I don't think so, I must take part in the search.

922
01:21:17,099 --> 01:21:19,025
-And what about me?

923
01:21:19,025 --> 01:21:21,062
What about your work? You said it's so strict there...

924
01:21:21,068 --> 01:21:23,025
-I took a day off.

925
01:21:24,051 --> 01:21:26,051
-And a day off of me, too?

926
01:21:26,051 --> 01:21:28,051
-Don't be ridiculous.

927
01:21:29,049 --> 01:21:31,058
You perfectly understand everything.

928
01:21:32,044 --> 01:21:34,033
-I just feel so lonely.

929
01:21:34,033 --> 01:21:36,008
You're there, I'm here...

930
01:21:36,008 --> 01:21:37,071
It won't be always like this, will it?

931
01:21:37,071 --> 01:21:38,092
-Sure it won't.

932
01:21:39,037 --> 01:21:41,030
Okay, goodbye, I really have to go.

933
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:42,083
-No, wait, wait!

934
01:21:42,083 --> 01:21:45,063
Don't hang up, I want to listen
to what you're doing there.

935
01:21:46,032 --> 01:21:48,083
-What are you talking about?

936
01:21:49,076 --> 01:21:51,050
It's not appropriate.

937
01:21:52,011 --> 01:21:53,050
-Why?

938
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:56,021
Are you hiding something?

939
01:21:56,039 --> 01:21:58,051
-Of course, not.

940
01:22:00,051 --> 01:22:02,055
-You're definitely hiding something.

941
01:22:02,055 --> 01:22:04,012
Is your ex also there?

942
01:22:05,032 --> 01:22:06,012
-Masha,

943
01:22:06,012 --> 01:22:08,012
don't be silly.

944
01:22:09,015 --> 01:22:11,004
I love you.

945
01:22:11,074 --> 01:22:13,004
-Really?

946
01:22:13,004 --> 01:22:14,042
-Of course.

947
01:22:15,024 --> 01:22:17,006
-I love you, too.

948
01:22:17,006 --> 01:22:19,053
We love you.
-Okay, bye.

949
01:22:19,063 --> 01:22:22,083
-Bye. Kiss you and I'm waiting for you!

950
01:22:24,006 --> 01:22:28,056
-Oh, oh, how gentle she is, like a kitty!..
-Mom...

951
01:22:28,098 --> 01:22:31,056
Let me do things myself, okay?

952
01:22:31,056 --> 01:22:34,042
-Sure, for God's sake!

953
01:22:35,008 --> 01:22:36,069
Of course, you do it yourself.

954
01:22:37,064 --> 01:22:40,097
It's just that my mother taught me
and I taught you:

955
01:22:41,045 --> 01:22:43,064
Those men, Masha, you know,

956
01:22:43,064 --> 01:22:45,042
are like babies.

957
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:50,071
You're such a beauty, my dear!

958
01:22:52,089 --> 01:22:56,028
Check this one, I showed you as you walked by,
you didn't even notice.

959
01:22:56,028 --> 01:22:57,022
-Mm, no...

960
01:22:57,056 --> 01:22:58,088
-Hi, dad.

961
01:22:59,018 --> 01:23:01,018
-Hello, my dear.

962
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:05,039
-So, how are you?

963
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:06,078
-Fine.

964
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:09,039
Autumn.

965
01:23:09,096 --> 01:23:12,041
-And we're having summer,
by the way, all the year.

966
01:23:13,011 --> 01:23:15,001
-Are you coming to Moscow some time?

967
01:23:15,001 --> 01:23:17,051
-What will I do there?

968
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,078
-Well, to see me.

969
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:23,067
-I see you right now.

970
01:23:25,048 --> 01:23:27,018
Obrigado.

971
01:23:32,013 --> 01:23:33,067
Okay, dad,

972
01:23:34,033 --> 01:23:37,045
I have to go, I have a meeting, I told you.

973
01:23:38,008 --> 01:23:40,091
Don't feel sad without me, please!

974
01:23:41,026 --> 01:23:45,015
I kiss you so so so much!

975
01:23:45,015 --> 01:23:47,071
-Okay, bye, I kiss you.

976
01:23:47,071 --> 01:23:50,052
-Kiss you! Bye bye bye!

977
01:24:45,024 --> 01:24:46,093
-Get up.

978
01:24:47,059 --> 01:24:49,026
It's time to go.

979
01:24:56,045 --> 01:24:58,009
-What's the time?

980
01:25:02,009 --> 01:25:04,067
-Look, I'll go with you, if it's okay.

981
01:25:05,026 --> 01:25:06,067
-Yeah, sure.

982
01:25:06,067 --> 01:25:09,047
Don't you need to go to work?
-The work will wait.

983
01:25:09,093 --> 01:25:10,064
-Right.

984
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:14,064
I need to call that, what's his name,

985
01:25:15,016 --> 01:25:16,080
the coordinator.

986
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:19,032
God, how late it is. I did set the alarm clock...

987
01:25:19,032 --> 01:25:20,087
-I switched it off,

988
01:25:20,087 --> 01:25:22,087
you had to rest.

989
01:25:31,044 --> 01:25:32,073
-Listening.

990
01:25:32,073 --> 01:25:34,073
-Hello, Ivan?
-Yes.

991
01:25:34,073 --> 01:25:36,073
-Hello, this is Alyosha Sleptsov's mother.

992
01:25:36,073 --> 01:25:38,073
-Yeah, do you have some news?

993
01:25:38,073 --> 01:25:42,024
-No, do you?
-Haven't found yet, we keep working.

994
01:25:43,079 --> 01:25:46,001
-Okay.
-Something else?

995
01:25:47,061 --> 01:25:50,004
-You see, I came back very late yesterday,

996
01:25:50,004 --> 01:25:52,084
so I couldn't...
-I'm sorry, I have absolutely no time right now,

997
01:25:52,084 --> 01:25:54,084
I'm sorry.

998
01:25:55,005 --> 01:25:56,075
-Yes, yes, I understand, just tell me

999
01:25:56,075 --> 01:25:58,029
what I can do.

1000
01:25:58,029 --> 01:26:00,029
I cannot just sit here and wait
-Take the phone

1001
01:26:00,029 --> 01:26:03,099
and start calling all the hospitals in the district,
without exceptions.

1002
01:26:03,099 --> 01:26:05,058
Any unidentified boy aged 10-13,

1003
01:26:05,058 --> 01:26:07,058
brought by the police or ambulance,

1004
01:26:07,058 --> 01:26:10,076
no matter if he fits the description,
is our case

1005
01:26:10,076 --> 01:26:12,076
and must be visually checked.

1006
01:26:13,018 --> 01:26:16,009
If you find one, 
inform me immediately,

1007
01:26:16,034 --> 01:26:19,015
preferably by SMS. I'll send a group there.

1008
01:26:19,052 --> 01:26:21,033
-We can go there ourselves, we have a car.

1009
01:26:21,038 --> 01:26:22,088
-Great. But inform me nevertheless.

1010
01:26:22,088 --> 01:26:26,078
In any case, there will be and experienced searcher
who knows how to behave in this situation.

1011
01:26:27,043 --> 01:26:30,041
If there are multiple cases,
it's better is there are

1012
01:26:30,041 --> 01:26:34,024
more that one group. 
That's it, I cannot talk anymore, we'll be in touch.

1013
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:55,024
When did you see him last?

1014
01:26:55,039 --> 01:26:57,066
-Well, two days before yesterday, I think.

1015
01:26:58,026 --> 01:26:59,053
-On the 9th?

1016
01:26:59,053 --> 01:27:01,053
On Tuesday?

1017
01:27:01,053 --> 01:27:03,053
-Yeah.
-Where?

1018
01:27:04,008 --> 01:27:05,062
-Here, at school.

1019
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,053
-And what did you do after school?

1020
01:27:10,032 --> 01:27:12,041
-Nothing, we went home.

1021
01:27:14,066 --> 01:27:16,059
-And where do you hang out usually?

1022
01:27:17,026 --> 01:27:19,011
-In the courtyard, I don't know.

1023
01:27:19,011 --> 01:27:21,011
-Okay, in the courtyard, and where else?

1024
01:27:21,082 --> 01:27:23,062
-Nowhere.

1025
01:27:23,066 --> 01:27:25,048
-Oh come on.

1026
01:27:25,048 --> 01:27:27,048
In the mall, probably?

1027
01:27:27,089 --> 01:27:30,034
-No, our parents don't let us go there.

1028
01:27:30,043 --> 01:27:33,084
-Are you some babies? Do you stay in the courtyard?
Playing in a sand-box, or something?

1029
01:27:34,012 --> 01:27:37,050
-Why babies? We play football
on a hockey playground.

1030
01:27:39,094 --> 01:27:41,084
-And do you have a bike?

1031
01:27:41,084 --> 01:27:43,084
-Yes.

1032
01:27:44,033 --> 01:27:47,007
-So, where do you usually go to with Alyosha?

1033
01:27:47,056 --> 01:27:48,095
-Well, nowhere.

1034
01:27:48,095 --> 01:27:50,095
In the block, around the buildings.

1035
01:27:50,095 --> 01:27:52,064
-Look, young man.

1036
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:55,055
If you know where he is 
but you're not telling because he asked you -

1037
01:27:55,055 --> 01:27:57,055
fine, don't tell.

1038
01:27:57,055 --> 01:27:59,055
I understand it, really.

1039
01:27:59,055 --> 01:28:03,019
The main thing is that you are sure
that you friend is safe, alive and well.

1040
01:28:03,029 --> 01:28:07,010
We are the grown-ups,
we'll run, we'll search, it's not a problem.

1041
01:28:07,042 --> 01:28:09,088
Just like the hide-and-seek, right?

1042
01:28:10,025 --> 01:28:12,012
Do you play a game with us?

1043
01:28:12,012 --> 01:28:14,012
-I really don't know where he is.

1044
01:28:17,071 --> 01:28:19,064
-Okay, I believe you.

1045
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:23,002
And where can he be?

1046
01:28:24,009 --> 01:28:26,070
I know, you have a camp.

1047
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:30,066
To be honest, I don't know where it is,
but I really know that it exists.

1048
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:33,000
You chatted about it on VKontakte.

1049
01:28:33,084 --> 01:28:37,063
If you really don't know where Alyosha is,
but you assume he could be there,

1050
01:28:37,063 --> 01:28:40,081
you have to tell us where this place is.

1051
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:44,088
Because you friend might be in danger now.

1052
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:53,028
Look, bro, we'll find him anyway.

1053
01:28:53,098 --> 01:28:56,039
But it can be too late, and it will be sad.

1054
01:28:57,026 --> 01:28:59,099
What's more important for you,
a friend or some place?

1055
01:29:00,004 --> 01:29:02,049
You'll find plenty of other places like that!

1056
01:29:02,049 --> 01:29:03,055
And if you gave some oath,

1057
01:29:03,055 --> 01:29:05,018
believe me, you aren't breaking it now,

1058
01:29:05,018 --> 01:29:06,099
because you're saving your friend,

1059
01:29:06,099 --> 01:29:08,051
and he really needs your help.

1060
01:29:10,051 --> 01:29:12,051
-It's in the forest,

1061
01:29:12,051 --> 01:29:13,042
the camp.

1062
01:29:13,074 --> 01:29:15,028
-Okay, good.

1063
01:29:15,028 --> 01:29:17,028
What is it? A dugout? A hut?

1064
01:29:17,028 --> 01:29:19,077
-No, it's an abandoned building.

1065
01:29:19,077 --> 01:29:21,077
It's in the basement.

1066
01:29:21,077 --> 01:29:23,077
-Is it better to go there on foot or by bike?

1067
01:29:24,081 --> 01:29:27,055
-It quite far, better by bike.

1068
01:29:27,055 --> 01:29:29,013
-Will you show?

1069
01:29:33,013 --> 01:29:35,032
You helped us a lot, thank you.

1070
01:29:36,005 --> 01:29:38,051
The boy of yours is a fine fellow.

1071
01:29:38,096 --> 01:29:40,099
Tell me, do you have some more time?

1072
01:29:40,099 --> 01:29:42,001
-Yes, I do.

1073
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:44,056
-Good. Will you go with us?
Would you help?

1074
01:29:44,056 --> 01:29:45,089
-Okay.

1075
01:29:45,089 --> 01:29:47,089
-Thank you, good bye!
-Good bye!

1076
01:30:14,036 --> 01:30:15,066
-So? Shall we go?

1077
01:30:15,066 --> 01:30:16,082
-Yeah, let's go.

1078
01:30:18,082 --> 01:30:19,082
One moment.

1079
01:31:56,082 --> 01:31:58,000
-It's there.

1080
01:32:35,087 --> 01:32:37,048
-That's his jacket.

1081
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,066
-Grandpa Pihto to Ivan, over.

1082
01:32:45,066 --> 01:32:48,066
We found a jacket, the father is sure it's his.
How copy?

1083
01:32:49,057 --> 01:32:50,044
-Acknowledged.

1084
01:32:50,044 --> 01:32:53,048
In this case we search
all the complex of buildings and surroundings.

1085
01:32:53,085 --> 01:32:54,067
I remind:

1086
01:32:54,067 --> 01:32:56,099
Mark dangerous, strange places

1087
01:32:56,099 --> 01:33:00,003
inform about them but don't go inside.

1088
01:33:00,003 --> 01:33:02,003
There are professionals for that.

1089
01:33:02,030 --> 01:33:04,045
Don't increase the suffering, don't get hurt.

1090
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:07,058
If something like this happens
we stop the search

1091
01:33:07,058 --> 01:33:11,032
and focus our efforts
on helping the partner.

1092
01:33:11,044 --> 01:33:14,040
First, contact the coordinator,
that is, me.

1093
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:17,093
Medical assistance is provided
by the doctor only. He's there.

1094
01:33:17,093 --> 01:33:19,093
Until he comes,

1095
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:22,044
the "runner", in case he's physically restrained,

1096
01:33:22,044 --> 01:33:24,044
stays untouched, we talk to him,

1097
01:33:24,044 --> 01:33:26,021
we comfort him verbally,

1098
01:33:26,021 --> 01:33:27,056
wait for the doctor.

1099
01:33:27,089 --> 01:33:29,048
Okay, let's race.

1100
01:33:29,048 --> 01:33:32,003
The race is a metaphor, don't take it literally.

1101
01:33:32,003 --> 01:33:34,003
Okay, let's go!

1102
01:34:37,042 --> 01:34:38,092
-Dawn to Ivan.

1103
01:34:38,092 --> 01:34:42,001
First floor and basement checked.

1104
01:34:42,001 --> 01:34:44,061
What are the further actions? How copy?

1105
01:34:45,084 --> 01:34:47,038
-Acknowledged, Dawn. Roger that.

1106
01:34:47,038 --> 01:34:49,063
You can help Fox 1 in the neighbour building.

1107
01:34:49,063 --> 01:34:50,060
Over.

1108
01:34:51,002 --> 01:34:53,002
-Acknowledged. Roger.

1109
01:36:06,058 --> 01:36:08,033
-Granpda Pihto to Ivan.

1110
01:36:08,033 --> 01:36:11,040
Roof and all rooms of the 2nd floor examined.

1111
01:36:11,066 --> 01:36:12,072
No traces.

1112
01:36:13,066 --> 01:36:14,092
How copy? Over.

1113
01:36:15,066 --> 01:36:17,066
-Acknowledged. Message for everybody.

1114
01:36:17,066 --> 01:36:19,039
Object closed, the both buildings.

1115
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:22,002
The boy's not found, we search the forest next.

1116
01:36:52,002 --> 01:36:53,068
-Hello.
-Hello.

1117
01:36:53,068 --> 01:36:55,000
-We need you help.
-Listening.

1118
01:36:55,016 --> 01:36:57,066
-We're from the search-and-rescue squad,
we're looking for a boy,

1119
01:36:57,066 --> 01:37:00,010
Alyosha Sleptsov, 12 years old, this is his mother.

1120
01:37:00,010 --> 01:37:02,099
He ran away and could have called himself
by different name.

1121
01:37:02,099 --> 01:37:05,088
We know that you received a boy
who fits the description.

1122
01:37:05,088 --> 01:37:07,040
Can we see him?

1123
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:10,079
-You two, take a seat here, please.

1124
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:12,021
And you go with me.

1125
01:37:13,017 --> 01:37:14,044
-Is he okay?

1126
01:37:14,044 --> 01:37:17,002
-He's fine, just tired and scared.

1127
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:20,030
-Well, the police picked him up in the street
yesterday at night.

1128
01:37:20,030 --> 01:37:22,080
They kept him till the morning somewhere,
then brought here.

1129
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:26,004
-How could they do that? They know about him,
I filed a report.

1130
01:37:26,004 --> 01:37:27,063
-They know nothing.

1131
01:37:27,063 --> 01:37:29,063
Another shift came, that's it.

1132
01:37:29,063 --> 01:37:31,063
Some strange kid,

1133
01:37:32,001 --> 01:37:34,013
who says nothing. They took him to the hospital.

1134
01:37:34,013 --> 01:37:36,013
A usual procedure.

1135
01:37:38,083 --> 01:37:40,024
Come in.

1136
01:37:41,099 --> 01:37:44,068
Hey... Wake up.

1137
01:38:23,015 --> 01:38:25,008
-Don't rush!

1138
01:38:25,008 --> 01:38:27,008
Keep up!

1139
01:38:27,008 --> 01:38:29,008
Maintain the visual contact.

1140
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:31,076
Keep together.

1141
01:39:02,047 --> 01:39:04,047
-No, we didn't see him here.

1142
01:39:04,075 --> 01:39:08,000
You cannot get to the territory
without a pass or a special permit.

1143
01:39:08,096 --> 01:39:10,086
-May I leave the posters?

1144
01:39:10,086 --> 01:39:12,052
Maybe the other shift saw him?

1145
01:39:12,052 --> 01:39:15,002
-No problem.
-Thanks a lot.

1146
01:39:15,061 --> 01:39:16,073
-Thank you!

1147
01:39:28,083 --> 01:39:31,017
-Fox 1, doing the calling.

1148
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:39,001
Aaa-lyooo-shaaa!

1149
01:39:47,038 --> 01:39:53,031
Aaa-lyooo-shaaa!

1150
01:39:59,071 --> 01:40:06,009
Aaa-lyooo-shaaa!

1151
01:40:13,079 --> 01:40:15,053
-Grandpa Pihto to Ivan.

1152
01:40:15,079 --> 01:40:17,082
Came to the river. No traces.

1153
01:40:17,082 --> 01:40:19,009
How copy?

1154
01:40:19,009 --> 01:40:21,042
-Acknowledged. Come back.

1155
01:40:21,042 --> 01:40:24,036
-Roger.
-What about in the river?

1156
01:40:24,088 --> 01:40:26,036
-We don't look for the dead.

1157
01:40:26,036 --> 01:40:29,028
It's done by the police or the Extreme Measures,
if there are reasons.

1158
01:40:29,028 --> 01:40:31,085
Crew! Go back!

1159
01:40:31,085 --> 01:40:33,085
Return to the base.

1160
01:40:34,056 --> 01:40:36,034
-Fox 1, we're going back.

1161
01:40:42,024 --> 01:40:44,048
-With regard to the absence of a positive result

1162
01:40:44,062 --> 01:40:47,042
in the search of a "runner" and
a sharp worsening of weather conditions

1163
01:40:47,042 --> 01:40:51,020
I make a decision
to change the status of the search.

1164
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:53,056
We start an intense informing of the public

1165
01:40:53,056 --> 01:40:55,056
about a child gone missing.

1166
01:40:55,056 --> 01:40:59,080
We start the total poster put-up:

1167
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:02,041
bus stops, underground crossings,

1168
01:41:02,041 --> 01:41:04,084
doorways, light poles,

1169
01:41:04,084 --> 01:41:07,042
benches, information boards,

1170
01:41:07,042 --> 01:41:11,039
fences, shops if there's permission
of the administrator.

1171
01:41:11,039 --> 01:41:12,082
As usually.

1172
01:41:13,039 --> 01:41:15,081
Now, I need 2 groups of 5 people

1173
01:41:15,081 --> 01:41:17,081
to check the doorways.

1174
01:41:19,024 --> 01:41:21,016
Great, we'll sort it out.

1175
01:41:21,016 --> 01:41:23,000
The others get on the put-up.

1176
01:41:23,018 --> 01:41:24,028
Okay, let's go!

1177

-The descriptions are here.

at the 3rd floor. How copy?

-It's going down.

1181
01:42:29,045 --> 01:42:31,004
-Oh. Good evening.
-Howdy...

1182

-Dawn to Ivan. It's not him.

1183

-Acknowledged. Keep the surveillance.

-Let's go...

-Excuse us, please...

-Young lady, please, go.

1192
01:43:04,054 --> 01:43:06,006
-How polite!

1193
01:50:19,066 --> 01:50:21,024
-Wait here.

1194
01:50:29,084 --> 01:50:31,034

Anton, can you...

1197

It'll be hard.

1198

-I am ready.

No, no, it's not him...

Please, take him away...

Please, take away...

just refuse to believe that...

-It's not him, how many times
must I repeat?

-Listen to me,

this analysis can be done only by you.
