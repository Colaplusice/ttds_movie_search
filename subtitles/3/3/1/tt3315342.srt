00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,930
Ah, Guys.

2
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,210
Those are chrome plated mugs.
You can't strip them.

3
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,530
<i>Look at this guy.</i>

4
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,170
The plate is flaked out.

5
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,570
<i>Yeah?</i>

6
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,850
This isn't at least.
No one is going to pay a buck...

7
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,650
<i>Pendejo,
Cabron.</i>

8
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,890
Shit.

9
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,290
Guys, guys.

10
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,330
Guys, seriously
you don't wanna do this.

11
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,330
<i>Take him out.</i>

12
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,690
No,
not The car..

13
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,930
<i>Kick that fool.</i>

14
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,010
Motherfuck..

15
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,530
Shit.

16
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,610
Fuck.

17

<i>Asleep between the next gen pornographer

<i>It's all related.</i>

20
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,490
<i>Hey, Clyde. It's 2029.</i>

21
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,010
<i>Why are we still talking about mutants?</i>

22
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,730
Hey It's Me.
I'm in the car.

23
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,130
Yes, it was a good trip.

24
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,970
Shit went up and down fast.

27
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,810
I knew it was you.

28
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,450
- Oh, fuck.
- Please!

29
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,130
I am in trouble!

30
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,370
You're the only one that can help!

31
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,410
Get the fuck away from me!

32
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,850
Please!

33
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,970
Logan!

34
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,250
Who was that?

35
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,170
I do not know, some crazy lady.
Don't worry about that.

36
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,090
As I lived in dream,
The Wolverine.

37
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,250
And he is a junkie now.

38
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,970
Who the fuck are you?

39
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,610
You know?
You got some buck shot on your door.

40
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,490
I heard you was in Phoenix.

41
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,730
But then last night some friends of mine
from Texas called

42
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,730
Told me they found 3 dead cholos
in the pool out 54.

43
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,810
Nothing unusual,
I know.

44
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,410
Except one missing a hand
another one leg.

45
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,890
So they was thinking...

46
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,210
It was either an escaped tiger
or Freddy Kruger.

47
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,650
But one man can drive...

48
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,890
One being fictional and
the other one extinct.

49
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,170
And since the wheel marks they found
belong to a 24 Chrysler...

50
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,570
right on...

51
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,970
This is a 24 Chrysler.

52
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,970
She found you yet?

53
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,210
Gabriela?

54
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,450
You see...

55
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,210
I'm not looking for you, Wolvie.

56
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,050
Well, not really, I'm looking for someone
who's looking for you.

57
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,170
She took me something of mine
when I wasn't looking.

58
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,970
Something for which I am responsible.

59
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,810
A Mexican lady

60
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,282
Doesn't ring a bell?

61
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:23,170
I don't know any Gabriella
So get the fuck out of my car.

62
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,450
You know?

63
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,050
I know where she's hiding me though

64
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,330
The old Cuban south of the border

65
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,210
What do you want?

66
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,930
A little cooperation.

67
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,930
I am a fan,
by the way.

00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:14,060
ok. What if I can put together $ 45,000
in cash right now?

00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:15,763

He needed it six hours ago.

86
00:14:29,747 --> 00:14:31,222
This is not enough you know.

87
00:14:32,368 --> 00:14:33,617
will see us through the week

88
00:14:33,902 --> 00:14:34,916
I'm working on it.

89
00:14:37,387 --> 00:14:38,387
Your turn.

90
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,708
I had a rough night.

91
00:14:42,305 --> 00:14:43,305
Poor of you.

92
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:50,962
In other views he told me, last night
he was communicating with someone.

93
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:53,218
He's not talking to anybody.

94
00:14:53,473 --> 00:14:54,546
Don't be so sure.

95
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:56,809
He has got all these details.

96
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,406
I thought that tank was filled
with actual barrier.

97

00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:17,142
I think he's trying to read my mind.

102

Shocks or seizures. Pills can prevent that.

I want you to blow off them
to make you safe.

Fuck off, Logan.

128
00:17:48,447 --> 00:17:49,819
Actually, you remember who I am now.

129
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:52,342
I always know who you are.

130

But sometimes I don't recognize you.

131
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:57,273
Take the pills.

132
00:18:03,268 --> 00:18:05,781
You leave me alone with that fucking albino.

133

He doesn't listen to me.

What?

136
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:15,219
Speciation, a new mutant, a young one.

137
00:18:16,068 --> 00:18:17,948
- There are forces trying to kill them.
- Forces?

138
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:19,085
They want help.

139

Forces, forces.

Oh yeah...
That's how fucking stupid they are.

They're waiting for you on the

Statue of Liberty was a long time ago,

There are no new mutants.
You understand?

146
00:18:43,732 --> 00:18:46,729
There was not anyone born in the 25 years.
Not anywhere.

147
00:18:47,118 --> 00:18:48,442
I've always thought...

148
00:18:49,486 --> 00:18:51,185
we were part of God's plan.

149
00:18:55,269 --> 00:18:56,269
Maybe...

150
00:18:57,332 --> 00:18:59,771
May be we're God's mistake.

151
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:12,379
What a disappoint man you are

152
00:19:15,294 --> 00:19:16,294
When I found you...

153
00:19:16,662 --> 00:19:20,368
you were disfiguring your career
as a cage fighter.

154
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:23,763
A wrong calculated life of assassin

155
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,132
Smoking barbiturates.

156
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,682
You were an animal.

157
00:19:29,946 --> 00:19:31,359
But we took you in.

158
00:19:32,523 --> 00:19:35,007
I gave you a family.

159
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:36,589
They are gone now.

160
00:19:36,793 --> 00:19:37,793
Logan.

161
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,144
Logan...

162
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:43,759
What did you do?

163
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:47,359
What did you do?

164
00:19:47,675 --> 00:19:49,648
Answer me! Why are we here?

165
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:51,569
No one should live like this.

166
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,144
Drugged in a fucking tank!

167
00:19:53,412 --> 00:19:55,490
- It's for your own good.
- No no, it's not!

168
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:01,206
You're waiting for me to die.

169
00:21:42,411 --> 00:21:43,640
I don't want to fight...

170
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,500
but there's things we need to discuss.

171
00:21:47,854 --> 00:21:48,923
What things?

172
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:53,066
Would it be considered negative?

173
00:21:53,461 --> 00:21:55,607
If I was repeat my previous observation...

174
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:58,345
this dose is too much
to suppress the seizures?

175
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,114
It's what the guy gave me.

176
00:22:02,407 --> 00:22:04,582
He was not in a position to make demands.

177
00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:06,107
I thought I was dying this morning.

178
00:22:06,406 --> 00:22:07,873
- That seizure...
- It was only a minute.

179
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:09,977
It felt a lot longer than a minute.
I could not breathe.

180
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:11,376
You are less affected.

181
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:13,393
You know you need to higher dose.

182
00:22:13,717 --> 00:22:16,307
And I know you got
more money squirreled away.

183
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:17,629
Money to get us out of here.

184
00:22:17,902 --> 00:22:19,494
No, not us. You and him.

185
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,358
You're saving to buy a sun seeker.

186
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:22,810
Sun is the key word.

187
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,262
I hardly see myself covering
below deck like Nosferatu

188
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,461
Do you?

189
00:22:27,664 --> 00:22:31,350
Folding your underpants,
And making him spotted dick

190
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,710
Found this in your pocket.

191
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:39,694
Adamantium.

192
00:22:41,523 --> 00:22:42,970
If you're planning to
blow your brains out...

193
00:22:43,235 --> 00:22:44,915
Could you wait till we're at the high seas?

194
00:22:45,104 --> 00:22:47,741
- I just mopped these floors.
- I don't need this shit.

195
00:22:57,963 --> 00:23:00,745
A year ago, you asked me to help you.

196
00:23:02,063 --> 00:23:03,708
God knows I've tried.

197
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:07,377
But I can't help you, Logan, not really...

198
00:23:08,524 --> 00:23:10,025
if you are not gonna talk to me.

199
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:13,784
I hear you at night.
You are not sleeping

200
00:23:14,074 --> 00:23:15,625
You don't wanna talk about that.

201
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:19,441
Or the booze your drinking.

202
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:22,557
Or the pus that you are
waiting to wipe on your knuckles.

203
00:23:23,383 --> 00:23:25,644
Or the blood I wash in your clothes

204
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,211
Or the fresh wounds in your chest.

205
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:30,559
The ones that aren't healing.

206
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,270
And I'm pretty sure..

207
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,390
You don't want to talk about the fact
that you can't read the label on that bottle.

208
00:23:37,069 --> 00:23:38,269
It says Ibruphen.

209
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,557
It was my favorite mug

210
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,829
Stay out of my ship.

211
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,334
Something is happening to you, Logan.

212
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:50,135
On the inside you're sick. I can smell it.

213
00:23:56,616 --> 00:23:58,147
<i>Best night of my life!</i>

214
00:24:00,495 --> 00:24:01,655
<i>Hey, driver.</i>

215
00:24:19,217 --> 00:24:22,143
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

216
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:24,011
<i>You are such a.</i>

217
00:25:21,691 --> 00:25:22,839
Mr. Logan.

218
00:25:23,048 --> 00:25:24,048
Jesus.

219
00:25:24,157 --> 00:25:25,686
Please. We need a ride.

220
00:25:25,964 --> 00:25:27,731
I am not available. Call a cab.

221
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:30,031
- My name is Gabriela Lopez.
- I don't wanna know your name lady.

222
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:31,727
there are Men after us.

223
00:25:31,952 --> 00:25:33,116
We need to get out of here.

224
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,105
Go north, cross to Canada.

225
00:25:35,292 --> 00:25:36,795
Anyone can do that job.

226
00:25:37,065 --> 00:25:38,065
I'll give you $ 50,000.

227
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:41,811
How did you find me huh?
You are fucking up my life lady.

228
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,356
- Laura, go inside.
- What sightings?

229
00:25:49,686 --> 00:25:53,378
People said someone look like a wolverine
was seen at Paso driving.

230
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,187
said he looked old.

231
00:25:58,683 --> 00:25:59,434
Hey!

232
00:25:59,652 --> 00:26:01,455
I told you to stop with that ball.

233
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:02,779
No, no, no please!

234
00:26:03,014 --> 00:26:04,654
- I told you, bad girl!
- No Please.

235
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:06,751
- Now your gonna have to pay for that.
- Stop Please.

236
00:26:09,348 --> 00:26:10,348
Shit!

237
00:26:12,553 --> 00:26:13,876
They gonna have to pay for damages.

238
00:26:15,418 --> 00:26:16,723
And she has cash.

239
00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:18,021
I've seen it.

240
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,678
You get your fat ass back in your office.

241
00:26:19,908 --> 00:26:20,908
You will get your money.

242
00:26:23,814 --> 00:26:25,711
Don't let call anyone. Please.

243
00:26:25,973 --> 00:26:27,887
They'll find us, they'll kill us.

244
00:26:36,155 --> 00:26:37,405
I'm a nurse.

245
00:26:38,845 --> 00:26:41,125
Was. In Mexico City.

246
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:43,719
When did that happen?

247
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,277
This morning. Near the border.

248
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,276
I got away from them, but...

249
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:55,628
Now they know my car.

250
00:26:59,381 --> 00:27:01,664
Look, I gotta go.

251
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:04,013
No wait. Please. Here.

252
00:27:04,491 --> 00:27:05,581
Please wait! Look.
here.

253
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,534
Look. Take this. It's $ 20,000.

254
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,826
Here. Take us to this address.

255
00:27:12,243 --> 00:27:14,451
You are gonna have $ 30,000 more
when we get there.

256
00:27:15,846 --> 00:27:17,735
My friends,
he would give it to you.

257
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,797
They will be waiting.

258
00:27:21,021 --> 00:27:22,170
They will give you anything.

259
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,578
Where did you get this?

260
00:27:24,803 --> 00:27:25,970
My boyfriend.

261
00:27:27,117 --> 00:27:29,549
He wants to kill me and take her.

262
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:34,230
That's his daughter?

263
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:37,274
Yes.

264
00:27:40,988 --> 00:27:43,246
I know that you're still good inside.

265
00:27:43,596 --> 00:27:44,596
I know you that want to help us.

266
00:27:44,785 --> 00:27:46,342
- You don't know anything about me.
- Please!

267
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:50,106
I promise, there will be no problems
if we leave now.

268
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:52,050
I can't just leave to North Dakota!

269
00:27:52,382 --> 00:27:53,942
- We have to be there Friday.
- For what?

270
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,457
Or we miss our chance to cross.

271
00:27:57,137 --> 00:27:58,220
Please.

272
00:27:59,331 --> 00:28:00,359
You have to. Please.

273
00:28:03,966 --> 00:28:04,987
Please.

274
00:28:12,474 --> 00:28:14,057
I like Rose.

275
00:28:14,372 --> 00:28:15,910
They make you look younger.

276
00:28:17,454 --> 00:28:18,758
<i>- Please hurry.
- I'm coming.</i>

277
00:28:20,522 --> 00:28:21,764
Charles, I gotta go uh,

278
00:28:22,749 --> 00:28:24,384
I gotta go away for a few days.

279
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:27,357
It will be alright,
This will get money going.

280
00:28:27,658 --> 00:28:29,459
When I get back, we can get out of here.

281
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:32,624
We're gonna drive to Yelapa.
Get ourselves a boat.

282
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:34,862
And we will go on the ocean.

283
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:37,164
Will we be safe there?

284
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,472
Yeah, we'll be safe.

285
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:50,871
I will be back in a few days.

286
00:29:34,096 --> 00:29:35,160
Shit.

287
00:29:43,062 --> 00:29:45,155
<i>They here, please.</i>

288
00:30:06,567 --> 00:30:07,885
- Logan.
- Ya?

289
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:09,185
What happened?

290
00:30:09,403 --> 00:30:10,737
Something's gone wrong?

291
00:30:11,003 --> 00:30:12,329
It was all just wrong
from the beginning.

292
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:33,897
Logan!

293
00:30:37,238 --> 00:30:38,238
Logan!

294
00:30:38,492 --> 00:30:39,586
What?

295
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,671
Who does this belong to?

296
00:30:49,607 --> 00:30:50,607
Who is that?

297
00:30:54,402 --> 00:30:56,746
Guess we are Supposed to see shit coming.

298
00:30:57,005 --> 00:30:58,109
They can track mutants.

299
00:30:58,369 --> 00:31:00,212
I'm a, not a clairvoyant.

300
00:31:00,556 --> 00:31:03,505
Go inside, Keep Charles alive.
Go inside Now!

301
00:31:12,934 --> 00:31:15,753
In case you aren't around, assholes.
It's private property.

302
00:31:16,023 --> 00:31:17,246
Yes it is.

303
00:31:18,188 --> 00:31:21,259
In fact, I believe it belongs to
Multinational Smelting company...

304
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:22,874
based in Shanghai.

305
00:31:24,524 --> 00:31:26,611
Where are you keeping the old man?

306
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:28,187
Is it over there?

307
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,082
Or over there?

308
00:31:33,306 --> 00:31:34,306
That would be smart.

309
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:38,033
I would like to meet him.

310
00:31:38,281 --> 00:31:42,941
Untold agency classifies his brain is
a weapon of mass destruction.

311
00:31:44,526 --> 00:31:45,871
Damn shame what happened back in east.

312
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:48,243
He's been dead for years.

313
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:51,579
I need the girl.

314
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:52,953
What girl?

315
00:31:53,152 --> 00:31:55,134
One girl along with that ball you own.

316
00:31:55,734 --> 00:31:57,314
There is no girl here.

317
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:59,017
I know you went to the motel.

318
00:31:59,345 --> 00:32:00,511
Yeah, I was called there.

319
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:02,497
There was no girl. Just a woman.

320
00:32:02,738 --> 00:32:05,198
Just a woman. I suspected she was.

321
00:32:08,122 --> 00:32:09,396
So you saw Gabriela.

322
00:32:10,901 --> 00:32:14,021
But you did not call me.
That hurts.

323
00:32:15,777 --> 00:32:17,209
You didn't shoot both of them,
did you?

324
00:32:17,495 --> 00:32:19,642
- No, did you?
- I asked you first.

325
00:32:19,922 --> 00:32:22,252
- I don't like guns.
- Or was.

326
00:32:23,084 --> 00:32:25,756
I wish you would call me Logan.

327
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:27,111
Like I asked you.

328
00:32:30,238 --> 00:32:31,352
See?

329
00:32:31,676 --> 00:32:33,616
You are not the only one
who's been enhanced.

330
00:32:41,892 --> 00:32:43,422
Logan.
Logan!

331
00:32:43,721 --> 00:32:45,619
This is Laura.

332
00:32:46,504 --> 00:32:47,504
Caliban, come!

333
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:50,285
This the Laura I've been telling you about.

334
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:52,126
This is Laura.

335
00:32:53,052 --> 00:32:54,705
We've been waiting for you.

336
00:32:59,827 --> 00:33:00,827
Come, come here.

337
00:33:02,078 --> 00:33:03,244
It's okay.

338
00:33:03,922 --> 00:33:04,922
Come.

339
00:33:06,475 --> 00:33:07,537
Laura.

340
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:12,174
It's ok, it's okay.

341
00:33:14,442 --> 00:33:15,442
come

342
00:33:15,898 --> 00:33:16,898
Come.

343
00:33:18,187 --> 00:33:21,726
Come. It's okay.
You can stay here, Laura.

344
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:23,384
It's safe.

345
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:26,727
Come on.

346
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,675
It's like ex military.
Kaiju hunter maybe?

347
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:31,976
Worse.

348
00:33:33,214 --> 00:33:34,268
Is he 'bout himself?

349
00:33:34,523 --> 00:33:35,623
Yeah, not for long.

350
00:33:36,491 --> 00:33:39,390
take him out to the wash and dump him.

351
00:33:39,722 --> 00:33:41,373
And what if he wakes up before I get there.

352
00:33:46,586 --> 00:33:48,674
Text me where you are. We will get you out.

353
00:34:04,192 --> 00:34:05,456
See, see

354
00:34:07,722 --> 00:34:08,722
Logan.

355
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,881
- Logan.
- Hey. Hey!

356
00:34:11,908 --> 00:34:15,059
You will get back and I'll try to figure out what
you and your mother about to send to me.

357
00:34:15,368 --> 00:34:16,436
- No, Logan.
- What?

358
00:34:16,773 --> 00:34:18,656
I believe that...

359
00:34:27,124 --> 00:34:29,838
Logan, the woman that you met
is not her mother.

360
00:34:30,664 --> 00:34:32,857
- So she talks?
- We are communicating.

361
00:34:33,268 --> 00:34:34,346
Communicate.

362
00:34:36,678 --> 00:34:37,722
Take these now.

363
00:34:38,758 --> 00:34:40,821
We have to get out of here.
It's not safe here anymore.

364
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:43,048
And you can't have any attack under it
you understand?

365
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:47,533
Yes, but this is the mutant
that I told you about.

366
00:34:47,821 --> 00:34:49,531
- She needs our help.
- She's not a mutant.

367
00:34:49,742 --> 00:34:51,975
- Yes she is!
- What's her gift, Charles?

368
00:34:52,226 --> 00:34:53,725
Eating? pipe Throwing?

369
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,761
It's okay.

370
00:35:18,221 --> 00:35:19,221
Oh yeah.

371
00:35:19,502 --> 00:35:21,373
"Take the gun. Dump the body".

372
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:23,496
"Text me where you are
and we'll get you back"

373
00:35:33,462 --> 00:35:34,963
You're fucked now, muty.

374
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,572
It's ok.

375
00:35:54,187 --> 00:35:56,048
It's ok. Sit down.

376
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,535
- We gotta go.
- What?

377
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:59,349
- What's going on?
- Stay here. Where?

378
00:35:59,494 --> 00:36:00,884
- Don't move.
- Where are we going?

379
00:36:01,913 --> 00:36:04,482
Don't worry.
He'll be back for you.

380
00:36:08,645 --> 00:36:11,363
Logan, the girl. Don't go.
Wait for the girl.

381
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:18,660
Logan, what about the girl?

382
00:36:20,766 --> 00:36:21,766
Logan.

383
00:36:28,057 --> 00:36:30,185
Logan, we must not forget about Laura.

384
00:36:30,462 --> 00:36:31,630
It's not our problem.

385
00:36:40,637 --> 00:36:41,637
Shit!

386
00:36:49,887 --> 00:36:50,887
Shit!

387
00:37:19,756 --> 00:37:20,756
Logan.

388
00:37:20,796 --> 00:37:21,796
Yeah, I'm thinking.

389
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:23,034
The child.

390
00:37:23,878 --> 00:37:25,471
Logan, we mustn't forget Laura.

391
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,900
- Please be quite.
- Logan.

392
00:37:32,262 --> 00:37:34,021
- Charles Xavier.
- Where's Caliban?

393
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:36,457
America's most wanted Octogenarian.

394
00:37:36,725 --> 00:37:38,063
I'm Not an Octogenarian, actually.

395
00:37:47,129 --> 00:37:48,129
Where is Caliban?

396
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,498
Why don't you tell me
where the girl is first.

397
00:37:51,768 --> 00:37:53,647
Or I can ask you about.
It seems quite friendly.

398
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,219
I told you she's not here.

399
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,807
Where is Caliban, fucker?

400
00:37:59,061 --> 00:38:01,233
I left him in the same ditch
he was gonna leave me.

401
00:38:17,707 --> 00:38:20,816
See, Mr. Wolverine, seeing you like
this justbreaks my damn heart.

402
00:38:31,246 --> 00:38:32,280
go get her.

403
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,470
Laura!

404
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,308
Bad girl!

405
00:39:53,728 --> 00:39:54,728
Hey baby.

406
00:40:04,062 --> 00:40:05,203
Laura...

407
00:40:08,278 --> 00:40:09,278
Laura!

408
00:40:09,685 --> 00:40:12,422
Honey, you wanna stay where you are.

409
00:40:13,127 --> 00:40:14,403
You want to see your friends, right?

410
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,379
Commander, just stop.

411
00:40:18,328 --> 00:40:19,877
Boss said alive or dead.

412
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,260
Laura!

413
00:40:23,969 --> 00:40:24,969
Laura.

414
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,634
Laura.

415
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:29,475
No no.

416
00:40:31,185 --> 00:40:32,697
Move! Now!

417
00:40:38,556 --> 00:40:39,652
Move! Now!

418
00:40:43,961 --> 00:40:45,486
Stop shooting.

419
00:40:45,852 --> 00:40:48,767
She heals! Move!
Quick!

420
00:42:42,121 --> 00:42:44,571
See I told you Logan,
She is just a mutant like you.

421
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:46,109
Hold on!

422
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,203
Very much like you.

423
00:43:12,553 --> 00:43:14,616
Laura, are you alright?

424
00:43:32,733 --> 00:43:33,733
Move!

425
00:43:42,647 --> 00:43:43,647
Hold on.

426
00:43:49,487 --> 00:43:51,106
Fuck!
Oh Come on!

427
00:43:52,911 --> 00:43:53,911
Come on!

428
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,900
Shit.

429
00:44:54,388 --> 00:44:56,938
In line, let's go.

430
00:45:48,368 --> 00:45:49,368
Sit back.

431
00:45:58,912 --> 00:46:00,153
Bring me the tracker.

432
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:08,768
You.

433
00:46:10,411 --> 00:46:11,901
Who the hell are you?

434
00:46:13,278 --> 00:46:16,214
Hey! I asked you a question.
Who are you?

435
00:46:17,418 --> 00:46:18,992
You know who she is, Logan.

436
00:46:19,836 --> 00:46:20,875
No, I don't

437
00:46:21,134 --> 00:46:23,212
Does she remind you of anybody?

438
00:46:54,856 --> 00:46:57,693
I read about you as a kid.

439
00:46:59,177 --> 00:47:00,791
I believe you think of someone else,

440
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:13,068
If now I'm not mistaken,
you used to work for my team.

441
00:47:13,649 --> 00:47:16,257
You were helping man above those mutants.

442
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:18,484
What changed?

443
00:47:19,976 --> 00:47:20,976
You got religious?

444
00:47:25,017 --> 00:47:29,775
I'm gonna need you to do one more thing
for the good guys...

445
00:47:30,395 --> 00:47:33,857
and track one more special mutant for me.

446
00:47:37,957 --> 00:47:39,030
I'm not helping you.

447
00:47:39,851 --> 00:47:41,333
Of course you would say that.

448
00:47:42,057 --> 00:47:44,830
But I've got a theory that
people don't really change.

449
00:47:49,196 --> 00:47:50,322
Beware of light.

450
00:47:52,224 --> 00:47:55,977
Caliban, I bet that's what your mama told you
day after day when you was a kid.

451
00:48:02,288 --> 00:48:03,461
Beware of the light.

452
00:48:09,462 --> 00:48:12,109
Let's not bring out the worst in it,
shall we?

453
00:48:12,291 --> 00:48:13,561
The girl is not worth it, trust me.

454
00:48:14,061 --> 00:48:16,184
She is not a natural fuck up, like you.

455
00:48:16,489 --> 00:48:19,064
She's a business mistake,
R&D going bad

456
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:20,361
There's a liability.

457
00:48:20,816 --> 00:48:24,054
They can't have things with their patients running around
hurting people, can they?

458
00:48:25,301 --> 00:48:28,689
We need to get her off the board
before she hurts anybody else.

459
00:48:28,999 --> 00:48:31,520
Someone you care about.

460
00:48:39,144 --> 00:48:40,304
So begins the sniffing.

461
00:48:44,926 --> 00:48:46,910
<i>My name is Gabriela Lopez.</i>

462
00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:48,624
<i>I'm a nurse.</i>

463
00:48:48,788 --> 00:48:52,814
<i>And for 10 years I worked for
Transigen research in Mexico City.</i>

464
00:48:54,254 --> 00:48:56,777
<i>Transigen is combined American company.</i>

465
00:49:00,219 --> 00:49:02,549
<i>What I'm about to show you is illegal...</i>

466
00:49:02,998 --> 00:49:05,122
<i>in the US and Canada.</i>

467
00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:14,990
<i>They told us we were part of a
pharmaceutical study.</i>

468
00:49:15,547 --> 00:49:17,170
<i>But Of course, it was a lie.</i>

469
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:20,441
<i>These children were born in Transigen.</i>

470
00:49:21,787 --> 00:49:23,106
<i>They were born here...</i>

471
00:49:23,395 --> 00:49:25,625
<i>and have never left.</i>

472
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:28,238
<i>They have never seen the sun or the ocean...</i>

473
00:49:29,242 --> 00:49:30,599
<i>rain or snow...</i>

474
00:49:32,158 --> 00:49:33,758
<i>or any of God's creatures.</i>

475
00:49:34,756 --> 00:49:36,605
<i>They have no birth certificates...</i>

476
00:49:37,242 --> 00:49:38,563
<i>No names...</i>

477
00:49:39,495 --> 00:49:40,975
<i>Except the ones we have given them.</i>

478
00:49:44,202 --> 00:49:47,915
<i>They were raised in the
bellies of Mexican Girls.</i>

479
00:49:48,231 --> 00:49:50,085
<i>Cause no one can find anyone.</i>

480
00:49:50,897 --> 00:49:53,988
<i>Their fathers were...</i>

481
00:49:54,296 --> 00:49:55,713
<i>Special seeds in bottles.</i>

482
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:11,745
<i>Birthday?</i>

483
00:50:15,251 --> 00:50:17,689
<i>We do not call them baby, or kiss..</i>

484
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,646
<i>Do not think them as children.
Think them as stupids</i>

485
00:50:21,005 --> 00:50:22,781
<i>with patents and copyrights.</i>

486
00:50:22,903 --> 00:50:25,160
<i>- Comprende?
- Si seneor.</i>

487
00:50:25,399 --> 00:50:28,305
<i>They thought we were too poor
and stupid to understand.</i>

488
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,892
<i>We are poor, yes...</i>

489
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,120
<i>but we are not stupid.</i>

490
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:33,239
<i>Use your powers.</i>

491
00:50:40,701 --> 00:50:41,871
<i>This is business.</i>

492
00:50:42,188 --> 00:50:44,501
<i>They are making soldiers.</i>

493
00:50:45,207 --> 00:50:46,321
<i>Killers.</i>

494
00:50:52,106 --> 00:50:54,207
<i>These are babies and mutantes...</i>

495
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:03,441
North Dakota.

496
00:51:04,627 --> 00:51:06,453
You took that woman's money.

497
00:51:06,738 --> 00:51:08,972
You said you would take the child there.

498
00:51:14,443 --> 00:51:15,983
What is she?

499
00:51:17,317 --> 00:51:18,889
She is your daughter, Logan.

500
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,824
Alkali has your genetic code.

501
00:51:23,005 --> 00:51:24,107
Not just mine.

502
00:51:24,368 --> 00:51:25,129
Logan...

503
00:51:25,274 --> 00:51:27,118
I do not want to talk about
I don't wanna hear about it anymore.

504
00:51:27,405 --> 00:51:28,889
- Logan...
- Just stop.

505
00:51:29,573 --> 00:51:30,904
I have to pee.

506
00:51:44,058 --> 00:51:45,058
Last lap.

507
00:51:49,545 --> 00:51:50,571
You're welcome.

508
00:51:57,182 --> 00:51:59,653
Stop it for God's sake,
least do it myself.

509
00:52:00,012 --> 00:52:02,158
yeah. But, you're not doing it.

510
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,921
Not with you standing there.

511
00:52:04,136 --> 00:52:05,723
Trust me, I'm not looking.

512
00:52:39,561 --> 00:52:40,576
Hello!

513
00:52:41,275 --> 00:52:42,275
Hi there!

514
00:52:42,835 --> 00:52:44,235
You know you got to pay for that, right?

515
00:52:46,484 --> 00:52:49,050
Hey! Where's your Mommy and Daddy huh?

516
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:53,299
Come on.

517
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,503
That's enough.. These too.

518
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:57,904
Shit!

519
00:52:58,169 --> 00:52:59,169
Not okay!

520
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:03,483
I am sorry.

521
00:53:05,969 --> 00:53:07,222
Cell phone chargers?

522
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:14,822
Come on. Get in the car.

523
00:53:41,241 --> 00:53:43,013
<i>As the children grew over...</i>

524
00:53:43,284 --> 00:53:45,248
<i>Laura. Laura.</i>

525
00:53:45,895 --> 00:53:47,605
<i>They became more difficult.</i>

526
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,766
<i>They were not to be controlled.</i>

527
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:57,529
<i>The company made their bodies into weapons.</i>

528
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,156
<i>They tried to teach them to kill.</i>

529
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:02,612
<i>But they do not want to fight.</i>

530
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:08,090
<i>A soldier who'll not fight is useless.</i>

531
00:54:10,401 --> 00:54:12,242
<i>Inside this building...</i>

532
00:54:12,475 --> 00:54:13,795
<i>They are working on something new.</i>

533
00:54:14,649 --> 00:54:17,473
<i>Something they think is better
than the children.</i>

534
00:54:19,293 --> 00:54:20,520
<i>Something They say is without a soul.</i>

535
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:29,942
<i>They would have been successful.</i>

536
00:54:30,862 --> 00:54:33,254
<i>A week ago, they told us
to shut the programme down.</i>

537
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,585
<i>Before they killing children to speak.</i>

538
00:54:42,182 --> 00:54:45,037
<i>We want to save as many children as we can.</i>

539
00:54:45,551 --> 00:54:48,680
<i>A heard about a place up North,
 for mutants.</i>

540
00:54:48,927 --> 00:54:50,032
<i>They call it Eden.</i>

541
00:55:04,649 --> 00:55:06,659
<i>If you're watching this...</i>

542
00:55:06,898 --> 00:55:08,634
<i>It means that I'm dead.</i>

543
00:55:09,897 --> 00:55:12,985
<i>I am not sure
if any of the children survived.</i>

544
00:55:13,232 --> 00:55:15,432
<i>We were separated.</i>

545
00:55:15,744 --> 00:55:17,685
<i>There is no more money.</i>

546
00:55:17,964 --> 00:55:19,540
<i>That was a lie.</i>

547
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:22,722
<i>She's not my child</i>

548
00:55:24,184 --> 00:55:25,464
<i>But I love her.</i>

549
00:55:26,795 --> 00:55:29,118
<i>You may not feel to love her.</i>

550
00:55:30,731 --> 00:55:33,151
<i>But she's your child.</i>

551
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:36,815
<i>Please. I beg you...</i>

552
00:55:37,068 --> 00:55:39,203
<i>take her to safety.</i>

553
00:56:26,277 --> 00:56:28,452
So it's where we're hiding now?

554
00:56:29,181 --> 00:56:30,181
We aren't hiding out.

555
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:32,445
We'll get couple of hours sleep...

556
00:56:32,666 --> 00:56:36,301
Clean up, get some new clothes,
get a new ride to get out of here.

557
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:44,709
<i>Harrah's Hotel and Casino
welcomes you to the Oklahoma City.</i>

558
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,476
Hey.

559
00:56:48,709 --> 00:56:50,229
<i>Endless fun at Harrah's Casino.</i>

560
00:56:50,443 --> 00:56:52,887
Hey, leave it out in front, alright?

561
00:57:00,966 --> 00:57:03,141
Come on let's go.

562
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:30,630
Hey, Laura.

563
00:57:30,945 --> 00:57:31,945
Let's go.

564
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:33,070
We need clothes.

565
00:57:45,992 --> 00:57:46,992
Going up.

566
00:57:49,222 --> 00:57:51,083
No, no, stop.
They are not to play.

567
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:54,774
- No, no, sorry. The chair.
- What? okay.

568
00:57:55,361 --> 00:57:56,561
Thank you.

569
00:57:57,942 --> 00:58:00,016
Come here. Stay there. Stand there.

570
00:58:01,049 --> 00:58:03,114
Logan, it is yours.

571
00:58:03,384 --> 00:58:04,129
What?

572
00:58:04,365 --> 00:58:06,429
Not here now.
We just need the room for changing.

573
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:23,847
This is a very famous picture, Laura.

574
00:58:24,162 --> 00:58:25,836
It's almost a 100 years old.

575
00:58:59,454 --> 00:59:04,069
I first saw this picture in the Essoldo
cinema in my own town...

576
00:59:04,389 --> 00:59:06,406
when I was at your age.

577
00:59:06,653 --> 00:59:09,935
<i>You are in Heaven, hallowed be thy name.</i>

578
00:59:10,226 --> 00:59:13,366
<i>Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done...</i>

579
00:59:24,518 --> 00:59:25,518
Shit.

580
01:00:20,635 --> 01:00:22,260
Do you read this in your spare time?

581
01:00:24,058 --> 01:00:25,938
Oh yeah, Charles,
We have ourselves an X man fan.

582
01:00:26,958 --> 01:00:28,709
You do know they are all bullshit right?

583
01:00:28,937 --> 01:00:31,780
Maybe a quarter bit happens,
and not like this.

584
01:00:32,889 --> 01:00:34,209
In the real world, people die.

585
01:00:34,307 --> 01:00:37,615
And no self promoting asshole in a fucking

586
01:00:37,876 --> 01:00:38,962
This is ice cream for.

587
01:00:38,986 --> 01:00:39,719
Logan...

588
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:41,310
Your nurse has been feeding her
some great bullshit.

589
01:00:41,455 --> 01:00:44,292
I thought that Laura needs remaining of
Life's impounds.

590
01:00:45,832 --> 01:00:48,018
Didn't you say something about finding
us a new ride?

591
01:00:49,478 --> 01:00:51,194
Two more pills in one hour.

592
01:00:52,121 --> 01:00:53,241
Give them to him.

593
01:00:54,006 --> 01:00:55,132
<i>Why, Shane?</i>

594
01:00:56,532 --> 01:00:58,483
<i>A man has to be what it is, Joey.</i>

595
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:01,428
<i>Can't break the moulds.</i>

596
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,984
<i>I tried, didn't work for me.</i>

597
01:01:04,276 --> 01:01:06,480
<i>Joey, once you know that you've killed...</i>

598
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:08,450
<i>There is no going back.</i>

599
01:01:08,837 --> 01:01:10,986
<i>Right or wrong is a brand.</i>

600
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,716
<i>A brand sticks.</i>

601
01:01:13,765 --> 01:01:16,978
<i>Now you run home to your mother and
tell her that everything is alright.</i>

602
01:01:18,217 --> 01:01:21,139
<i>There are no more guns in the valley now.</i>

603
01:01:41,963 --> 01:01:43,082
Who are you guys?

604
01:01:43,725 --> 01:01:46,498
More cops?
cause I told the other guys...

605
01:01:48,923 --> 01:01:50,667
<i>CLOSED</i>

606
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:58,660
Get up! In your cage, tracker.

607
01:01:58,979 --> 01:02:00,416
You did your job.

608
01:02:00,889 --> 01:02:02,201
Help yourself out.

609
01:02:04,252 --> 01:02:05,442
Say what. Eight grand...

610
01:02:05,738 --> 01:02:07,813
I'll later paint it for you, new tires,

611
01:02:09,263 --> 01:02:10,071
and complete paperwork.

612
01:02:10,271 --> 01:02:12,390
I'll give you Ten as it is
if you can forget the paperwork.

613
01:02:42,855 --> 01:02:43,855
Jesus.

614
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:59,208
Oh you fuckin' kidding me

615
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:11,591
Sir, you have your keys in it...? Sir!

616
01:03:11,793 --> 01:03:13,778
You have the keys in it?
Sir!

617
01:03:18,483 --> 01:03:19,792
Shit!

618
01:03:43,414 --> 01:03:45,029
Charles. Charles!

619
01:06:29,041 --> 01:06:30,241
You alright?

620
01:06:32,395 --> 01:06:33,481
We gotta get out of here.

621
01:06:36,767 --> 01:06:38,367
I am so sorry.

622
01:06:40,043 --> 01:06:41,461
I am so sorry.

623
01:07:07,168 --> 01:07:08,688
<i>Emergency personnel is still...</i>

624
01:07:08,878 --> 01:07:11,507
<i>At Harrah's Casino and Hotel
in Oklahoma City</i>

625
01:07:11,706 --> 01:07:15,487
<i>where at least 400 guest was striken
with temporary paralysis yesterday.</i>

626
01:07:19,334 --> 01:07:21,076
<i>Which left over 600 injured...</i>

627
01:07:21,277 --> 01:07:24,842
<i>And took the lives f several mutants
including sevaral of the X men.</i>

628
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:25,777
Not at all.

629
01:07:28,663 --> 01:07:30,239
I said not at all!

630
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,939
She's a child, Logan.

631
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,963
And as far as fact, She is your...

632
01:07:36,164 --> 01:07:37,684
How long did you recently take your meds?

633
01:07:40,036 --> 01:07:41,946
- Tell me, how long has it been?
- Don't know!

634
01:07:43,223 --> 01:07:44,519
Two days.

635
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,198
You saw what happened yesterday.

636
01:07:46,399 --> 01:07:48,396
If that shit, can't go on any longer...

637
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:50,901
I did what I had to do to save Laura

638
01:07:51,002 --> 01:07:52,201
You didn't do anything.

639
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:54,873
You'd just freaked out and had
a fucking siezure.

640
01:07:55,475 --> 01:08:00,914
I think you prefer me for assumingly
catch straight grumbling on like a lunatic

641
01:08:01,015 --> 01:08:02,480
So much easier for you.

642
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:03,778
Easier? Jesus!

643
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:06,175
There is nothing easy back here.
Charles, Nothing!

644
01:08:06,276 --> 01:08:08,788
Yes, yes,

645
01:08:08,987 --> 01:08:11,486
Blaming someone else for your boring shit.

646
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,404
I know.
I was a giant disappointed.

647
01:08:13,605 --> 01:08:17,434
You obviously do not know
no sence importance

648
01:08:17,636 --> 01:08:18,636
for what do we do?

649
01:08:18,734 --> 01:08:20,371
Okay, what are we doing?

650
01:08:21,146 --> 01:08:24,665
There is a young mutant
sitting in our car.

651
01:08:24,866 --> 01:08:25,965
Yeah.

652
01:08:26,067 --> 01:08:28,175
And where we are taking her,
there are others.

653
01:08:28,374 --> 01:08:30,113
Does that mean nothing to you?

654
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:32,118
Oh yeah, yeah it means nothing to me.

655
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,925
Especially since that Gabriela...

656
01:08:34,124 --> 01:08:36,439
She made all that new shit off the
fucking comic Books.

657
01:08:36,641 --> 01:08:38,352
What are you talking about?

658
01:08:38,453 --> 01:08:40,758
Give that to him, Take out two pills
and give that to him.

659
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,365
Logan, Logan.

660
01:08:42,566 --> 01:08:43,566
Now!

661
01:08:48,955 --> 01:08:49,955
I wanna see them.

662
01:09:42,924 --> 01:09:45,292
Fucking loading trucks.

663
01:09:46,919 --> 01:09:48,905
And you're screaming at a machine.

664
01:09:49,106 --> 01:09:52,343
Now what? She can go with a man a feet
without hearing million words.

665
01:09:52,543 --> 01:09:55,165
She can learn to be better.

666
01:09:55,364 --> 01:09:56,730
You mean, better than me?

667
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:58,500
Actually yes.

668
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:02,478
And by the way, Laura's foot claws are

669
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:05,265
obvious result of her gender.

670
01:10:05,465 --> 01:10:06,664
Is that expected?

671
01:10:06,665 --> 01:10:08,838
In a pride of lions, the females...

672
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:11,280
is the hunter and carrier.

673
01:10:11,481 --> 01:10:12,680
Good to Know.

674
01:10:13,082 --> 01:10:15,543
She uses her front claws for hunting...

675
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:17,217
And her back claws for defencing.

676
01:10:17,241 --> 01:10:18,041
Oh yeah?

677
01:10:18,242 --> 01:10:19,707
Thus ensuring their survival.

678
01:10:26,099 --> 01:10:27,099
Hey hey!

679
01:10:56,066 --> 01:10:57,664
We should help them.

680
01:10:59,076 --> 01:11:01,409
No we have to keep going.
Someone will come along.

681
01:11:01,511 --> 01:11:03,102
Someone has come along.

682
01:11:14,916 --> 01:11:17,276
<i>Alert, alert.</i>

683
01:11:59,937 --> 01:12:01,850
Hey, you need a hand?

684
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:04,807
Ready? Go!

685
01:12:07,987 --> 01:12:09,314
Good, got it!

686
01:12:10,917 --> 01:12:11,949
Let's get home.

687
01:12:12,050 --> 01:12:12,950
Laura!

688
01:12:13,201 --> 01:12:14,201
Thanks so much for help.

689
01:12:14,742 --> 01:12:16,125
- I'm Kathryn.
- James.

690
01:12:16,326 --> 01:12:17,326
He's my son Nate.

691
01:12:17,626 --> 01:12:18,824
- Hi.
- Hi.

692
01:12:19,024 --> 01:12:20,222
That's your daughter?

693
01:12:20,426 --> 01:12:22,711
Yes, she is Laura, and that's my dad...

694
01:12:23,412 --> 01:12:24,612
Chuck.

695
01:12:24,809 --> 01:12:25,602
Come on, Laura, let's go.

696
01:12:25,703 --> 01:12:29,287
Well, can we sure atleast?

697
01:12:29,488 --> 01:12:30,765
We don't live not far from here.

698
01:12:30,899 --> 01:12:32,881
- No thanks.
- That would be lovely.

699
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:42,562
I'm Dr. Rice.

700
01:12:42,763 --> 01:12:44,598
But you can call me Xander if you like.

701
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:49,494
My colleague tells me that
you got some resistant.

702
01:12:49,896 --> 01:12:53,518
We believe you've been
dispensing delayed information.

703
01:12:53,719 --> 01:12:55,886
To allow your friends take one step ahead.

704
01:12:59,303 --> 01:13:01,742
I'm offering you a possibility of redemption, Caliban.

705
01:13:02,908 --> 01:13:05,953
To protect the world and
save your friends.

706
01:13:06,156 --> 01:13:09,505
The girl is just a small pass
to that.

707
01:13:09,705 --> 01:13:11,422
Unlike you, she isn't pure.

708
01:13:11,624 --> 01:13:13,185
It was not made by nature.

709
01:13:13,485 --> 01:13:14,690
She's my mistake.

710
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:17,190
I did what I could
and they burned me and beat me.

711
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:19,025
Your colleagues are savages.

712
01:13:19,627 --> 01:13:20,955
I agree.

713
01:13:21,155 --> 01:13:22,918
The Reavers were very ineffective

714
01:13:23,218 --> 01:13:26,030
I will only choose to bear.

715
01:13:26,232 --> 01:13:28,251
But I still need someone to part
us in the right direction.

716
01:13:28,452 --> 01:13:29,617
No, I can't help you.

717
01:13:29,918 --> 01:13:31,537
Please, please.

718
01:13:31,738 --> 01:13:33,673
What does he have? the old man?

719
01:13:33,874 --> 01:13:35,683
Alzheimers?

720
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:40,898
A degenerative brain disease in the
world's most dangerous brain.

721
01:13:41,699 --> 01:13:42,878
What a collab.

722
01:13:56,519 --> 01:13:59,257
Thank you God for this food...

723
01:13:59,859 --> 01:14:02,336
And our new friends to have us.

724
01:14:02,885 --> 01:14:04,160
They came to our help.

725
01:14:04,361 --> 01:14:05,744
- Amen.
- Amen.

726
01:14:06,144 --> 01:14:07,335
Here you go.

727
01:14:07,536 --> 01:14:09,335
Thanks.

728
01:14:27,717 --> 01:14:29,271
Well, there is plenty more if she wants.

729
01:14:29,473 --> 01:14:31,348
She doesn't. Thank you.

730
01:14:31,548 --> 01:14:32,133
This is delicious.

731
01:14:32,233 --> 01:14:33,534
- Thank you.
- So good.

732
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:34,964
Where are you all going?

733
01:14:35,165 --> 01:14:36,694
- Oregon.
- Ah. South Dakota.

734
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:41,852
Well, Oregon and then South Dakota.

735
01:14:42,051 --> 01:14:43,384
Vacation?

736
01:14:43,585 --> 01:14:44,586
Yes.

737
01:14:45,646 --> 01:14:46,646
Prolonged.

738
01:14:46,927 --> 01:14:48,155
We are city folks.

739
01:14:48,356 --> 01:14:51,746
Always wanted to do take a road trip,
see the country.

740
01:14:53,014 --> 01:14:54,317
Meet the people in it.

741
01:14:54,518 --> 01:14:55,888
That sounds lovely.

742
01:14:55,989 --> 01:14:58,632
I'm trying to get Will
to take a vaction for years.

743
01:14:58,833 --> 01:15:01,442
If you take trips the whole of country,
Who is gonna take care of this place?

744
01:15:01,742 --> 01:15:03,540
Exactly. I say let it go.

745
01:15:03,742 --> 01:15:04,742
And live up where?

746
01:15:04,893 --> 01:15:06,639
The Lord will provide.

747
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,227
I'm still waiting for the Lord to provide
me a new Thresher.

748
01:15:10,142 --> 01:15:12,408
Honestly, I love to travel someday.

749
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:14,314
I bet you will.

750
01:15:14,911 --> 01:15:16,916
- I can drive by to school.
- Ok, let's not go to that far.

751
01:15:17,116 --> 01:15:18,343
I'll do it.

752
01:15:18,423 --> 01:15:19,672
- No.
- Why not?

753
01:15:19,773 --> 01:15:22,079
- You wanted to tranvel, I wanna travell.
- Son. Son.

754
01:15:22,579 --> 01:15:23,579
That sounds pretty good.

755
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:24,938
It's the perfect.

756
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:26,460
Why do you want to do that, Nate?

757
01:15:27,315 --> 01:15:29,873
Careful, you're speaking to a man
who ran a school...

758
01:15:31,291 --> 01:15:32,632
for a lot of years, Charles?

759
01:15:33,418 --> 01:15:35,189
Well, that's correct
It was a...

760
01:15:35,894 --> 01:15:38,920
It was a kind of special needs school

761
01:15:40,182 --> 01:15:41,671
That's a good description.

762
01:15:42,472 --> 01:15:43,843
He was there too.

763
01:15:44,044 --> 01:15:46,529
Yeah, I was in it too.
I got expelled out 3 times.

764
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:50,425
I wish I could say that you were a good pupil,
but the words will choke me.

765
01:16:13,205 --> 01:16:16,491
Well, I can't thank you enough for this.
It was great.

766
01:16:16,692 --> 01:16:18,386
But we have a long drive out...

767
01:16:18,687 --> 01:16:19,687
You need to rest, don't you?

768
01:16:19,888 --> 01:16:21,445
Yeah, we'll find a motel.

769
01:16:21,645 --> 01:16:23,704
The nearest one is two hours and
it's not even that nice.

770
01:16:24,204 --> 01:16:27,026
We have a perfectly fine room upstairs
for your father and daughter...

771
01:16:27,227 --> 01:16:28,787
and you can sleep in the living room on the.

772
01:16:28,987 --> 01:16:30,987
Kathryn, you're very very nice,
but we must go.

773
01:16:31,685 --> 01:16:33,756
We can leave early in the morning.

774
01:16:33,957 --> 01:16:37,139
Right at dawn, is it good?

775
01:16:39,776 --> 01:16:41,813
Ok, why don't we wash off after?

776
01:16:42,013 --> 01:16:43,013
Okay.

777
01:16:43,363 --> 01:16:44,364
Sit down.

778
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:50,241
Sweetie, you want some dessert?

779
01:16:50,442 --> 01:16:53,746
Two days on the road, only one meal
Hardly any sleep.

780
01:16:53,947 --> 01:16:55,859
She is 11 and I'm fucking 90, dammit.

781
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,032
There is 101 reasons to keep moving.

782
01:16:58,134 --> 01:17:00,195
I'm not a box of avocados, Logan.

783
01:17:00,396 --> 01:17:01,944
We were to sleep, then what?

784
01:17:02,145 --> 01:17:05,574
Then we take her to her friends in Eden.

785
01:17:07,937 --> 01:17:10,214
And then we bought the Sun Seeker.

786
01:17:11,721 --> 01:17:13,002
Take the pills.

787
01:17:17,484 --> 01:17:18,484
Shit!

788
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:21,591
- What's going on?
- Nate!

789
01:17:21,884 --> 01:17:23,743
Fill the tub before we lose pressure.

790
01:17:23,944 --> 01:17:25,357
Honey, check the sink.

791
01:17:27,543 --> 01:17:29,036
They are not going to leave this for you.

792
01:17:29,236 --> 01:17:30,652
We might will handle it now.

793
01:17:30,853 --> 01:17:32,532
Can't wait till morning.
Cause it rained last night

794
01:17:32,733 --> 01:17:35,111
We have three guests
and a sink full of dishes.

795
01:17:35,312 --> 01:17:36,907
Alright. Alright.

796
01:17:37,959 --> 01:17:40,324
The pumping station that supplies us
is Mile and a half.

797
01:17:40,825 --> 01:17:42,421
Sometimes it get itself shut off.

798
01:17:42,622 --> 01:17:44,209
- That asshole.
- Hey!

799
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:44,794
No.

800
01:17:45,094 --> 01:17:47,171
My son is happy to go with you.

801
01:17:47,272 --> 01:17:48,959
No,
that's fine.

802
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:51,000
The men that do this
sometimes they can be...

803
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,950
- I can go.
- No, do your homework.

804
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:54,549
Okay, I'll go.

805
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:56,230
Just I need to get my dad settled.

806
01:18:00,385 --> 01:18:01,385
Nice.

807
01:18:25,024 --> 01:18:26,147
You Want TV?
there is TV here.

808
01:18:26,349 --> 01:18:27,159
No thank you.

809
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:28,459
Get some rest.

810
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:30,613
You know, Logan?

811
01:18:31,278 --> 01:18:33,303
This is what a life will explain.

812
01:18:33,803 --> 01:18:36,251
A home, people love each other.

813
01:18:36,452 --> 01:18:37,749
A safe place.

814
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:40,312
You should take a moment and feel it.

815
01:18:43,369 --> 01:18:45,151
Yeah. It's great.

816
01:18:45,351 --> 01:18:46,990
Logan.
Logan!

817
01:18:48,762 --> 01:18:50,936
You still have time.

818
01:18:54,035 --> 01:18:58,118
Charles, the world
is not the same as it was.

819
01:19:00,566 --> 01:19:03,188
We came to risking around here,
you know that.

820
01:19:03,792 --> 01:19:06,450
And where we're going, Eden...

821
01:19:07,382 --> 01:19:08,713
does not exist.

822
01:19:09,633 --> 01:19:11,817
Her nurse got it from a comic book.

823
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:16,157
You understand?
It's not real.

824
01:19:16,757 --> 01:19:18,674
It is for Laura.

825
01:19:22,658 --> 01:19:24,906
It is for Laura.

826
01:19:27,817 --> 01:19:29,357
Get some rest.

827
01:19:32,828 --> 01:19:36,045
Canewood beverage bought everything up
except for us.

828
01:19:36,245 --> 01:19:38,776
We wouldn't sell, They tried under domain.

829
01:19:38,976 --> 01:19:40,576
They still mess with our water.

830
01:19:41,606 --> 01:19:44,122
A couple of months ago,
somebody poisoned our dogs.

831
01:19:44,721 --> 01:19:47,320
So they were on highways today on
those trucks?

832
01:19:48,358 --> 01:19:49,924
I don't know. Maybe.

833
01:19:51,336 --> 01:19:53,207
Hold that.

834
01:19:53,806 --> 01:19:57,005
They are like dinosaures with 20 tonns body
and tiny little brains.

835
01:19:59,548 --> 01:20:00,698
And all tastes like shit too.

836
01:20:00,899 --> 01:20:02,218
Why do people eat?

837
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:04,577
The don't.
Drink it. Corn syrup.

838
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:10,463
to stay awake, cheer up,
feel strong, sexy, whatever.

839
01:20:10,564 --> 01:20:13,382
Used to be a time,
when a bad day was just a bad day.

840
01:20:13,583 --> 01:20:14,636
Mine are still on.

841
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:39,467
Those are for

842
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:42,381
These are for barrel racing...

843
01:20:42,581 --> 01:20:44,588
and right here this for

844
01:20:44,788 --> 01:20:46,614
They are all second and third place.

845
01:20:46,816 --> 01:20:50,415
I'm not too good, but my dad makes me.

846
01:20:59,147 --> 01:21:01,000
Do you want to listen?

847
01:21:11,357 --> 01:21:12,357
You like it?

848
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:18,685
Take, you can take them for tonight...

849
01:21:18,886 --> 01:21:22,045
and I get it back from you
in the morning.

850
01:21:26,398 --> 01:21:28,408
Seems like we'll be here a while.

851
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:58,797
That'll hold.

852
01:21:58,952 --> 01:22:00,165
Yeah.

853
01:22:00,367 --> 01:22:01,897
Until next time.

854
01:22:02,597 --> 01:22:03,685
Thanks.

855
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:09,011
Hey, how long your daughter's
been like that?

856
01:22:10,157 --> 01:22:11,175
Mute.

857
01:22:14,428 --> 01:22:15,848
Since the beginning.

858
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:19,471
In a lot of ways, I envy you.

859
01:22:20,613 --> 01:22:23,706
When they get to be Nate's age,
the nonsence that comes out of their mouths

860
01:22:29,502 --> 01:22:30,937
Shit.

861
01:22:35,238 --> 01:22:36,238
Don't worry.

862
01:22:38,388 --> 01:22:39,388
Stay here.

863
01:22:46,836 --> 01:22:48,470
Good evening, Mr. Munson.

864
01:22:48,901 --> 01:22:49,970
What brings you out this way?

865
01:22:51,069 --> 01:22:52,604
You should ask your boys.

866
01:22:52,805 --> 01:22:55,468
Mr. Munson, you know that
you're tresspassing right now, right?

867
01:22:55,669 --> 01:22:58,403
I had a lease with the previous owner
of the barn.

868
01:22:58,644 --> 01:22:59,704
Bullshit.

869
01:22:59,905 --> 01:23:01,919
Previous offered it for me

870
01:23:03,162 --> 01:23:04,353
Who is this?

871
01:23:05,632 --> 01:23:08,149
It's the guy who tells you to
get back in your nice truck.

872
01:23:08,349 --> 01:23:10,962
Go to play old somewhere else.

873
01:23:15,384 --> 01:23:16,598
Hey, Carl...

874
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:20,374
Looks like Mr Munson hired some muscle.

875
01:23:20,575 --> 01:23:21,915
So it's that way.

876
01:23:21,916 --> 01:23:23,416
He is a friend of mine.

877
01:23:23,616 --> 01:23:25,218
A friend with a big mouth.

878
01:23:25,719 --> 01:23:26,941
I hear that a lot.

879
01:23:27,142 --> 01:23:28,582
Then you probably hear this too.

880
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:32,729
More than I like it.

881
01:23:32,932 --> 01:23:34,129
Then you know what to do.

882
01:23:35,416 --> 01:23:37,177
I'll count to three...

883
01:23:37,378 --> 01:23:38,547
and you're gonna start walking away.

884
01:23:38,779 --> 01:23:39,779
I have a right to this water.

885
01:23:39,888 --> 01:23:41,088
- One.
- I have a lawyer now.

886
01:23:41,288 --> 01:23:42,288
Two.

887
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:44,820
Three.

888
01:23:45,933 --> 01:23:46,933
You okay, boss?

889
01:23:49,595 --> 01:23:51,195
You know the drill.

890
01:23:51,333 --> 01:23:52,333
Get away.

891
01:23:52,431 --> 01:23:54,193
Okay, boss?

892
01:23:54,395 --> 01:23:55,395
Go.

893
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:13,916
You got training.

894
01:24:14,318 --> 01:24:15,361
Some.

895
01:24:34,914 --> 01:24:37,164
Hey, don't wake her yet.

896
01:24:37,697 --> 01:24:39,942
Let her sleep for one more hour.

897
01:24:44,391 --> 01:24:45,951
You know, Logan?

898
01:24:47,768 --> 01:24:50,715
This was without a doubt...

899
01:24:51,916 --> 01:24:56,885
the most perfect night I've had in a very long time.

900
01:25:04,882 --> 01:25:06,878
But I don't deserve it.

901
01:25:13,544 --> 01:25:15,795
I did something.

902
01:25:18,498 --> 01:25:20,921
Something unspeakable.

903
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:30,415
I have remembered
what happened in Westchster.

904
01:25:35,094 --> 01:25:38,208
This is not the first time I have hurt.

905
01:25:40,366 --> 01:25:43,673
Until today, I did not.

906
01:25:44,684 --> 01:25:46,469
You wouldn't tell me.

907
01:25:48,809 --> 01:25:54,686
So we just, kept from...
running away from.

908
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:02,780
I think I finally understand you.

909
01:26:06,255 --> 01:26:07,473
Logan...

910
01:26:35,226 --> 01:26:36,515
It is fantastic.

911
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:38,120
You said you only needed the girl!

912
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:45,160
Nate?

913
01:26:49,119 --> 01:26:50,371
Leave her.

914
01:26:58,790 --> 01:26:59,790
Honey.

915
01:27:00,435 --> 01:27:01,959
Stay there, Will!

916
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:07,750
Kathryn!

917
01:27:08,276 --> 01:27:09,276
Kathryn!

918
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:10,867
Kathryn!

919
01:27:39,307 --> 01:27:40,347
Charles!

920
01:27:41,407 --> 01:27:42,537
Charles!

921
01:27:55,924 --> 01:27:56,924
Hold this.

922
01:27:57,049 --> 01:27:59,167
Was not me. it Was not me.

923
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:02,860
Here it comes.

924
01:28:03,724 --> 01:28:05,860
Pick it up.
We are halfway.

925
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:07,720
No no no. They will come to us.

926
01:28:07,772 --> 01:28:09,772
We struggled with X-23s.

927
01:28:10,072 --> 01:28:11,072
You see because they are children...

928
01:28:11,251 --> 01:28:12,593
We can raise them without conciousness.

929
01:28:12,794 --> 01:28:14,647
But you can't manage her rage.

930
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:15,967
You simply design it..

931
01:28:24,794 --> 01:28:27,158
Who the fuck is that?

932
01:28:32,101 --> 01:28:33,271
Will Munson!

933
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:37,891
Hold on, Charles.

934
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:40,603
Munson, goddammit, come out here!

935
01:28:44,902 --> 01:28:45,961
Munson!

936
01:28:47,758 --> 01:28:49,189
Come here now!

937
01:28:49,890 --> 01:28:51,436
Come out here now, Munson.

938
01:28:51,642 --> 01:28:52,895
There's that asshole.

939
01:28:54,950 --> 01:28:56,145
Hey, asshole.

940
01:28:56,412 --> 01:28:59,353
Listen, I'm willing to let bygones
be bygones.

941
01:28:59,653 --> 01:29:01,378
I do not know what Munson's paying you..

942
01:29:01,978 --> 01:29:04,774
but Canewood can start you at Five G.

943
01:29:05,075 --> 01:29:06,075
A week that is.

944
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:09,989
You better stay where you are pal.

945
01:29:10,190 --> 01:29:11,912
I'm the law out here.

946
01:29:13,843 --> 01:29:14,843
No no no.

947
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:16,883
What no!

948
01:29:18,801 --> 01:29:20,523
Oh SHit!

949
01:29:20,724 --> 01:29:21,825
Shoot him!

950
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:24,838
We need to intervene.

951
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:27,171
Well all this is you, Doc.

952
01:29:30,291 --> 01:29:31,291
24!

953
01:29:32,655 --> 01:29:33,655
Get back here!

954
01:29:34,653 --> 01:29:35,799
Stop!
stop Now!

955
01:29:36,078 --> 01:29:37,838
Hold yourself.

956
01:29:42,139 --> 01:29:43,844
- Our boat.
- What?

957
01:29:49,331 --> 01:29:51,446
The sun seeker.

958
01:30:01,179 --> 01:30:02,179
No.

959
01:30:11,543 --> 01:30:12,543
Come!

960
01:30:12,599 --> 01:30:13,699
24!

961
01:30:14,698 --> 01:30:15,944
All man here!

962
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:30,903
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

963
01:30:38,249 --> 01:30:38,964
Come!

964
01:30:39,165 --> 01:30:40,466
Now!

965
01:30:41,349 --> 01:30:42,644
Pick it up.

966
01:30:53,491 --> 01:30:54,591
Beware of the light.

967
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:19,116
What the hell are you?

968
01:33:45,881 --> 01:33:47,252
Sit down.

969
01:34:06,452 --> 01:34:07,706
Let us go.

970
01:34:08,108 --> 01:34:09,505
Hands down.

971
01:34:31,490 --> 01:34:32,506
Load it to the truck.

972
01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:33,708
Yes.

973
01:34:42,259 --> 01:34:44,127
It's alright, it's alright.

974
01:34:44,327 --> 01:34:47,151
You did fine 24.

975
01:34:47,351 --> 01:34:49,179
You are healing.
Just breathe.

976
01:34:50,549 --> 01:34:53,134
You're a new born, by new measure.

977
01:34:53,335 --> 01:34:54,611
Just breathe.

978
01:34:54,913 --> 01:34:55,974
Your body has work to do.

979
01:34:56,175 --> 01:34:58,764
Hemostasis, angiogenesis,
epithelialization...

980
01:34:58,965 --> 01:35:00,160
Stem cell proliferization.

981
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:03,912
This will help you heal.

982
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,288
Make you stronger.

983
01:36:01,204 --> 01:36:02,504
Well...

984
01:36:08,342 --> 01:36:10,139
It's near the water and...

985
01:36:33,315 --> 01:36:34,616
It's the water.

986
01:36:52,429 --> 01:36:53,623
Fuck. Fuck.

987
01:36:53,624 --> 01:36:54,624
Dammit!

988
01:37:09,134 --> 01:37:10,134
Dammit!

989
01:37:14,509 --> 01:37:16,607
Fuck! Fuck!

990
01:37:16,608 --> 01:37:17,608
Fuck!

991
01:37:18,308 --> 01:37:19,308
Shit!

992
01:37:31,797 --> 01:37:34,371
Fuck! Fuck!

993
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:36,440
Fuck!

994
01:37:36,598 --> 01:37:38,062
Motherfucker...!

995
01:37:42,431 --> 01:37:43,431
Shit!

996
01:37:44,667 --> 01:37:46,666
Fuck! Fuck!

997
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:16,054
Welcome back.

998
01:38:16,758 --> 01:38:18,614
I just thought that I have to tell..

999
01:38:18,816 --> 01:38:20,573
that nice little girl
out in the waiting room...

1000
01:38:20,773 --> 01:38:22,239
that daddy's gone.

1001
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:29,502
I always hoped...

1002
01:38:30,352 --> 01:38:34,699
that I get the chance to meet someone
like you.

1003
01:38:35,101 --> 01:38:36,737
Since a few left.

1004
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:41,539
Nice to meet you too, doctor.

1005
01:38:41,740 --> 01:38:42,820
But I gotta get on my way.

1006
01:38:43,059 --> 01:38:44,259
No, do not do that.

1007
01:38:44,459 --> 01:38:46,765
What you need is rest and treatment.

1008
01:38:46,964 --> 01:38:48,327
You need to check yourself somewhere.

1009
01:38:48,528 --> 01:38:50,876
- I'll be fine.
- No, you're not!

1010
01:38:51,177 --> 01:38:54,216
I know that you're different...

1011
01:38:54,417 --> 01:38:57,597
but that doesn't change the fact that
inside you is poisoned.

1012
01:38:57,798 --> 01:39:00,038
You have to check youself into a hospital.

1013
01:39:00,238 --> 01:39:01,751
Find out what it is.

1014
01:39:02,253 --> 01:39:03,489
I know what it is.

1015
01:39:04,388 --> 01:39:07,692
Please Mr, if you don't want to go to a hospital,
maybe I can help you.

1016
01:39:07,894 --> 01:39:09,123
Maybe I can run some tests.

1017
01:39:09,324 --> 01:39:11,552
Look, Doc. You seem like a nice guy.

1018
01:39:11,752 --> 01:39:13,434
If you want to save my life
save your own.

1019
01:39:13,732 --> 01:39:14,772
Forget we were here.

1020
01:39:14,852 --> 01:39:15,952
Let's go.

1021
01:39:27,169 --> 01:39:28,249
Hey!

1022
01:39:28,651 --> 01:39:29,651
Hey!

1023
01:39:50,222 --> 01:39:52,150
You can't just take..

1024
01:40:10,570 --> 01:40:12,967
I don't know how you got me here but..

1025
01:40:13,986 --> 01:40:14,986
Thank you.

1026
01:40:15,857 --> 01:40:17,105
Yeah.

1027
01:40:19,065 --> 01:40:20,474
You can talk?

1028
01:40:22,619 --> 01:40:23,887
You can talk?

1029
01:40:24,712 --> 01:40:26,344
What the hell...?

1030
01:40:26,643 --> 01:40:27,643
Why the fuck...?

1031
01:40:27,773 --> 01:40:30,829
What's all this bullshit
during this 3000 fucking miles?

1032
01:40:33,924 --> 01:40:35,490
What? Shut up.

1033
01:40:35,691 --> 01:40:36,882
Shut up, dammit!

1034
01:40:39,847 --> 01:40:41,982
What? Who is that?

1035
01:40:42,283 --> 01:40:43,336
Who is that?

1036
01:40:49,048 --> 01:40:50,048
North Dakota.

1037
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:51,898
What?

1038
01:40:53,656 --> 01:40:54,803
Shit, Look...

1039
01:40:57,754 --> 01:40:59,477
This place. Yeah?

1040
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:02,997
Your nurse, she read too many stories,
you understand?

1041
01:41:03,299 --> 01:41:04,799
Too many stories!

1042
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:11,415
I've seen it! I've seen it, okay?

1043
01:41:11,634 --> 01:41:12,754
This all here...

1044
01:41:12,855 --> 01:41:15,843
None of this..none of this exist
in real, ok?

1045
01:41:16,044 --> 01:41:18,818
I mean this Eden does not exist.
No no.

1046
01:41:19,019 --> 01:41:20,956
It's a fantasy. You can't see that?

1047
01:41:21,057 --> 01:41:23,247
Those are the names of people
who made this...

1048
01:41:23,972 --> 01:41:25,795
They made this whole thing up.

1049
01:41:26,197 --> 01:41:27,441
Okay? this whole..

1050
01:41:27,641 --> 01:41:30,511
It happened once, and they just
turned it into a big fucking lie.

1051
01:41:30,712 --> 01:41:33,108
All this is. No!

1052
01:41:33,826 --> 01:41:34,909
Fuck.

1053
01:41:35,747 --> 01:41:36,767
No.

1054
01:41:37,169 --> 01:41:39,171
I know, I understand.

1055
01:41:39,371 --> 01:41:41,485
This is long away.

1056
01:41:41,686 --> 01:41:45,125
You understand?
I am not taking you to North Dakota.

1057
01:41:48,712 --> 01:41:51,842
I am fucked up. I can not get you there.

1058
01:41:52,044 --> 01:41:55,265
These are two days away.
And no I'm not taking...

1059
01:41:56,467 --> 01:41:57,350
You hit me!

1060
01:41:58,132 --> 01:41:58,892
Don't hit me!

1061
01:42:01,331 --> 01:42:02,453
Stop saying those names.

1062
01:42:02,655 --> 01:42:04,892
And stop saying them.

1063
01:42:05,328 --> 01:42:06,354
Stop!

1064
01:42:06,555 --> 01:42:07,655
Stop!

1065
01:42:07,957 --> 01:42:10,395
Fuck!

1066
01:42:11,395 --> 01:42:14,376
You wanna go?
I'll take you there.

1067
01:42:14,703 --> 01:42:16,194
..See for yourself.

1068
01:42:16,495 --> 01:42:18,820
Fucking damn fantasy land.

1069
01:42:31,798 --> 01:42:34,110
We understand the importance of containment,
Dr. Rice.

1070
01:42:34,411 --> 01:42:36,582
But You can not leave a war zone behind
like you did in Juarez.

1071
01:42:36,783 --> 01:42:39,151
Try to remind yourself these are
killing machines.

1072
01:42:39,352 --> 01:42:41,347
Cute little puppy disembowed their families.

1073
01:42:41,548 --> 01:42:42,548
Not all.

1074
01:42:43,645 --> 01:42:46,676
I was told to have this patients, up hold.

1075
01:42:46,877 --> 01:42:48,075
You changing my direction?

1076
01:42:48,475 --> 01:42:49,475
No.

1077
01:42:49,566 --> 01:42:50,645
Why?

1078
01:42:52,589 --> 01:42:53,644
Dissect tissues from inside.

1079
01:42:53,845 --> 01:42:56,012
It's good tracker,
high IQ.

1080
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:02,741
Here you go.

1081
01:43:24,144 --> 01:43:25,667
North Dakota

1082
01:43:39,306 --> 01:43:40,367
Hey.

1083
01:43:49,346 --> 01:43:50,664
Let me drive.

1084
01:43:53,258 --> 01:43:54,541
Absolutely not.

1085
01:44:00,182 --> 01:44:01,800
Quit looking at me.

1086
01:44:08,994 --> 01:44:10,490
You're dying.

1087
01:44:13,385 --> 01:44:14,769
You want to die.

1088
01:44:17,670 --> 01:44:19,267
Charles told me.

1089
01:44:22,263 --> 01:44:24,543
What else did he tell you?

1090
01:44:24,843 --> 01:44:26,496
Do not let him.

1091
01:44:38,599 --> 01:44:40,513
Hey Hey hey!

1092
01:44:47,658 --> 01:44:48,676
Rest.

1093
01:47:32,953 --> 01:47:34,476
Keep it stable.

1094
01:47:36,775 --> 01:47:38,349
Swing it towards me.

1095
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:13,779
Where am I?

1096
01:48:15,648 --> 01:48:17,348
Hey!

1097
01:48:17,712 --> 01:48:18,882
Where did you get that?

1098
01:48:19,101 --> 01:48:20,464
Where we came from.

1099
01:48:21,064 --> 01:48:23,263
They gave it to us when we were fighting.
It makes you stronger.

1100
01:48:23,463 --> 01:48:25,133
It makes you crazy is what it does.

1101
01:48:25,335 --> 01:48:26,131
It'll kill you.

1102
01:48:26,331 --> 01:48:28,341
Not if you use it in small doses.

1103
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:30,306
It's helping you heal.

1104
01:48:31,704 --> 01:48:33,075
Where is Laura?

1105
01:48:33,274 --> 01:48:35,219
She is sleeping down there.

1106
01:48:35,419 --> 01:48:37,203
You want me to wake her up?

1107
01:48:44,902 --> 01:48:46,101
No.

1108
01:49:07,286 --> 01:49:08,988
You had a nightmare.

1109
01:49:12,771 --> 01:49:14,603
Do you have nightmares?

1110
01:49:19,965 --> 01:49:21,650
People who hurt me.

1111
01:49:23,808 --> 01:49:25,339
Mine are different.

1112
01:49:31,431 --> 01:49:32,815
I hurt people.

1113
01:49:50,669 --> 01:49:52,202
You know what it is?

1114
01:49:53,999 --> 01:49:55,901
It's made of adamantium.

1115
01:49:56,715 --> 01:49:59,017
It's what they put into us.

1116
01:49:59,916 --> 01:50:01,631
So it could kill us.

1117
01:50:03,527 --> 01:50:05,790
Probably what's killing me now.

1118
01:50:07,984 --> 01:50:09,101
Anyway...

1119
01:50:09,801 --> 01:50:11,473
I got this a long time ago...

1120
01:50:12,883 --> 01:50:16,282
and kept as a remember
of what I am.

1121
01:50:18,586 --> 01:50:20,562
Now I keep it to...

1122
01:50:32,142 --> 01:50:34,448
I was thinking of shooting myself.

1123
01:50:35,019 --> 01:50:36,499
Like Carles said.

1124
01:50:42,398 --> 01:50:44,228
I have hurt people too.

1125
01:50:47,189 --> 01:50:50,055
You gonna have to learn
how to live with that.

1126
01:50:59,549 --> 01:51:01,549
They Were bad people.

1127
01:51:05,342 --> 01:51:07,054
All the same.

1128
01:52:20,310 --> 01:52:22,597
It's not funny. That's not funny!

1129
01:52:25,186 --> 01:52:26,586
Hey! Hey pops.

1130
01:52:26,786 --> 01:52:29,023
How long have I been out?

1131
01:52:30,633 --> 01:52:31,913
How long was I in that bed?

1132
01:52:32,036 --> 01:52:33,304
Two days.

1133
01:52:34,831 --> 01:52:36,202
Go and tell them to get packing.

1134
01:52:36,402 --> 01:52:37,946
You can not just stay here.

1135
01:52:38,145 --> 01:52:40,141
We had to wait.
It was the plan.

1136
01:52:40,339 --> 01:52:42,537
And everyone had till today
to find their way here.

1137
01:52:42,737 --> 01:52:45,297
If you keep waiting, Alkali will find
and they kill you all.

1138
01:52:45,456 --> 01:52:46,456
You need to get out!

1139
01:52:46,503 --> 01:52:48,580
We are leaving tomorrow before dawn.

1140
01:52:49,079 --> 01:52:50,630
We gonna cross the border.

1141
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,382
It's a safety.

1142
01:52:53,689 --> 01:52:54,782
See the coordinates?

1143
01:52:55,033 --> 01:52:57,130
Yes, between noon and 5..

1144
01:52:57,331 --> 01:52:59,732
satellites..

1145
01:52:59,931 --> 01:53:02,225
- Your asylum is approved.
- Alright.

1146
01:53:18,233 --> 01:53:19,925
Further to your right, Laura.

1147
01:53:23,331 --> 01:53:25,209
A little more. Yes.

1148
01:53:25,409 --> 01:53:26,804
Do you see the Woods?

1149
01:53:30,522 --> 01:53:31,886
That's a 8 mile hike from here.

1150
01:53:33,043 --> 01:53:34,234
And you see that pass?

1151
01:53:35,690 --> 01:53:36,836
That's the border.

1152
01:53:38,743 --> 01:53:40,602
That's where we'll be safe.

1153
01:53:47,874 --> 01:53:49,434
Come inside.

1154
01:53:56,234 --> 01:53:57,782
Laura told me
what you did for her.

1155
01:53:58,391 --> 01:54:00,328
She was lucky to have you.

1156
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:04,681
Take it. She says it's yours.

1157
01:54:06,552 --> 01:54:09,185
It's why you did, right?

1158
01:54:11,368 --> 01:54:13,268
yeah, Well...

1159
01:54:13,870 --> 01:54:16,724
Look, I do not need it.
You do. okay?

1160
01:54:17,063 --> 01:54:18,721
Suit yourself.

1161
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:42,050
Your friends they seem nice.

1162
01:54:42,149 --> 01:54:43,165
Kind of reminds me of...

1163
01:54:44,934 --> 01:54:46,282
Hey, hey, what's going on?

1164
01:54:49,382 --> 01:54:50,794
You're with your pals. You made it.

1165
01:54:51,794 --> 01:54:53,292
Where will you go?

1166
01:54:54,385 --> 01:54:55,897
The nearest bar to get started.

1167
01:54:57,313 --> 01:54:59,678
Hey, I got you here.
That was all I stand up for.

1168
01:54:59,879 --> 01:55:01,730
I even gave back the money.

1169
01:55:01,930 --> 01:55:02,930
Such a nice man.

1170
01:55:03,072 --> 01:55:05,285
Hey, I never asked for this.

1171
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:07,692
Alright? Charles did not ask for this.

1172
01:55:07,894 --> 01:55:09,796
Caliban never asked for this.

1173
01:55:10,568 --> 01:55:12,592
And they are six feet under the ground.

1174
01:55:13,733 --> 01:55:15,722
I do not know what Charles
put into your head...

1175
01:55:15,923 --> 01:55:18,660
but I'm not whatever it is you think I am.

1176
01:55:20,105 --> 01:55:22,259
I even met you like a week ago.

1177
01:55:23,537 --> 01:55:25,504
You got your Rebecca, Delilah...

1178
01:55:25,641 --> 01:55:27,423
to blah, blah, or whatever

1179
01:55:27,622 --> 01:55:29,161
Everything you've asked for you've got it.

1180
01:55:32,324 --> 01:55:34,141
And it is better this way.

1181
01:55:35,611 --> 01:55:37,544
Because I suck at this.

1182
01:55:39,144 --> 01:55:42,326
Bad shit happens to people I care about.

1183
01:55:42,526 --> 01:55:44,016
You understand me?

1184
01:55:46,417 --> 01:55:47,819
Then I'll be fine.

1185
01:57:45,789 --> 01:57:48,592
Run!
Run!

1186
01:58:58,691 --> 01:58:59,941
Run, Bobby, run!

1187
01:59:24,144 --> 01:59:25,545
Go! Go!

1188
01:59:26,269 --> 01:59:27,269
Go faster.

1189
01:59:27,467 --> 01:59:29,471
We should reach them before
they get to the border.

1190
02:00:46,204 --> 02:00:47,407
Move out!

1191
02:00:47,607 --> 02:00:48,607
Let's go! Let's go!

1192
02:00:50,476 --> 02:00:51,875
Run! Run!

1193
02:00:53,478 --> 02:00:54,711
Run!

1194
02:01:01,242 --> 02:01:02,775
I want you to breath.

1195
02:01:02,975 --> 02:01:04,233
Just a flesh wound.

1196
02:01:20,439 --> 02:01:21,439
There she is!

1197
02:01:21,861 --> 02:01:22,861
We got her!

1198
02:01:25,531 --> 02:01:27,512
Back off!

1199
02:01:54,107 --> 02:01:55,107
Stay behind me!

1200
02:02:16,684 --> 02:02:18,482
You took all the medicine.

1201
02:02:20,116 --> 02:02:21,322
It's going to effect.

1202
02:02:48,048 --> 02:02:49,320
Go with your friends.

1203
02:02:50,684 --> 02:02:51,785
Go.

1204
02:02:53,082 --> 02:02:54,250
Laura?

1205
02:02:56,262 --> 02:02:57,507
You know when.

1206
02:03:09,669 --> 02:03:10,905
9'o clock!

1207
02:03:12,903 --> 02:03:15,244
The green juice made it all pal!

1208
02:03:16,244 --> 02:03:18,763
You old fool though,
need to scale a short high.

1209
02:03:19,163 --> 02:03:20,765
Hard to keep your claws out sometime.

1210
02:03:20,965 --> 02:03:22,539
Waste this dick, Logan!

1211
02:03:24,067 --> 02:03:25,733
Please stop, Mr. Howlett.

1212
02:03:26,243 --> 02:03:28,359
You gonna have to tell this
bunch of file on these children.

1213
02:03:28,558 --> 02:03:29,867
You don't want that.

1214
02:03:30,069 --> 02:03:32,339
conceading the effect of serum.

1215
02:03:32,538 --> 02:03:35,089
It will not survive for the wounded.

1216
02:03:35,374 --> 02:03:36,903
Allow me to introduce myself.

1217
02:03:37,315 --> 02:03:38,318
Zander Rice.

1218
02:03:39,472 --> 02:03:41,512
I believe you knew my father
in the weapon x program.

1219
02:03:41,712 --> 02:03:45,245
Yeah. he's the asshole
who put this poison in me.

1220
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:47,708
Yes, he was one of them.

1221
02:03:49,145 --> 02:03:50,881
I think I might have killed him.

1222
02:03:52,284 --> 02:03:53,286
I think you're right.

1223
02:03:53,484 --> 02:03:54,882
Show some respect, muty.

1224
02:03:55,082 --> 02:03:56,996
Your'e looking at the man
who fucked up your kind.

1225
02:03:57,497 --> 02:03:59,571
My friend Donald exaggerates.

1226
02:04:00,492 --> 02:04:03,291
He makes it sound more Brutal than intended.

1227
02:04:03,491 --> 02:04:06,602
But that was not to end mutant kind...

1228
02:04:06,802 --> 02:04:08,107
but to control it.

1229
02:04:10,196 --> 02:04:12,896
I've realized we can't stop perfecting
what we've even dreamt

1230
02:04:13,125 --> 02:04:15,225
We could use that part to perfect ourselves.

1231
02:04:16,328 --> 02:04:19,096
Gene therapy discreeting through..

1232
02:04:19,295 --> 02:04:21,396
from soft drinks to breakfast cereals.

1233
02:04:21,597 --> 02:04:22,768
And it worked.

1234
02:04:22,966 --> 02:04:25,374
Random mutaantcy went like polio.

1235
02:04:25,575 --> 02:04:26,975
We will launch our next...

1236
02:04:27,103 --> 02:04:28,710
Create mutants on your own.

1237
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:30,990
- precisely.
- These are dangerous times, James. You can't.

1238
02:04:50,003 --> 02:04:51,003
Show time, boy!

1239
02:05:27,626 --> 02:05:29,500
Get up, boy
Get up, boy!

1240
02:05:34,312 --> 02:05:35,611
He did that. Get up!

1241
02:05:48,984 --> 02:05:50,577
Laura!
No!

1242
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:56,700
Laura!

1243
02:07:31,350 --> 02:07:32,350
You.

1244
02:07:32,890 --> 02:07:33,989
Go!

1245
02:07:35,290 --> 02:07:36,792
Go! Go! Go!

1246
02:07:37,491 --> 02:07:39,922
Go! Get out of here! Go!

1247
02:07:43,474 --> 02:07:45,540
Go!
Go!Go!Go!

1248
02:07:50,039 --> 02:07:51,039
Faster Faster!

1249
02:07:51,599 --> 02:07:52,599
Quick!

1250
02:07:53,375 --> 02:07:54,181
Run!

1251
02:07:54,383 --> 02:07:55,383
No!

1252
02:08:35,325 --> 02:08:36,726
No no. Do not.

1253
02:09:01,648 --> 02:09:03,277
Take your friends and hide.

1254
02:09:03,519 --> 02:09:04,711
No.

1255
02:09:05,441 --> 02:09:08,031
They'll keep coming.

1256
02:09:08,232 --> 02:09:10,830
Listen, you don't have to fight anymore.

1257
02:09:15,151 --> 02:09:17,176
Go!

1258
02:09:24,709 --> 02:09:26,729
Don't be what they made you.

1259
02:09:34,740 --> 02:09:37,059
Laura...
Laura...

1260
02:09:41,407 --> 02:09:42,408
daddy.

1261
02:09:51,909 --> 02:09:54,617
Ah, so this is what it feels like.

1262
02:09:56,722 --> 02:09:57,722
No!

1263
02:10:05,586 --> 02:10:06,586
No!

1264
02:10:20,229 --> 02:10:21,229
daddy!

1265
02:10:22,050 --> 02:10:23,052
daddy!

1266
02:10:54,883 --> 02:10:57,795
<i>A man has to be what he is, Joey.</i>

1267
02:10:59,190 --> 02:11:00,726
<i>Can't break the moulds.</i>

1268
02:11:03,709 --> 02:11:06,158
<i>There is no living with a killing...</i>

1269
02:11:07,246 --> 02:11:09,225
<i>There is no going back.</i>

1270
02:11:11,289 --> 02:11:13,213
<i>Right or Wrong,
it is a brand.</i>

1271
02:11:14,166 --> 02:11:16,041
<i>A brand that's...</i>

1272
02:11:19,072 --> 02:11:21,470
<i>Now you run home to your mother</i>

1273
02:11:22,673 --> 02:11:26,075
<i>Tell her everything is alright.</i>

1274
02:11:27,676 --> 02:11:30,975
<i>There are no more guns in the Valley</i>

1275
02:11:47,827 --> 02:11:49,828
Let's go.
We gotta move.
