I Never Do That to my kid!

73
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,966
The worst thing you can do for a sick child,

74
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,095
is to believe or believe invincible.

75
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,806
It's not Because we love someone we can save Him.

76
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,566
Love has nothing to do with it.

77
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,777
Unfortunately.

78
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:53,737

623
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:15,733
Between-Provoking ...

I remember the name.

627
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:31,197
When He Was Little, it was fine. We thought it was just ...

628
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,168
Hyperactivity! Hyperactivity, that's it.

629
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:39,961
Aim Then His Father died 3 years ago and ...

633
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,612
You know, Steve, there ...

634
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,487
This afternoon ...

635
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,242
Steve is violent.

636
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:12,656
It's a good kid, full of charisma, but ...

637
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:16,213
When he fired up His cable, better not be around,

638
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,206
Because everything goes.

639

- I Understand That. - No, no, no, no ...

642
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:34,346
This is Because at the hospital, They Quickly jump to conclusions.

643
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,600
I saw. I know the drill.

644
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,942
The DASS, blue ...

645
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:44,855
They Would Be damned to get me to return to the center, etc etc.

646
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,371
Goal Steve is no place there. Right?

647
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,538
You do not know, you saw goal.

648
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:59,134
I'm glad, for cons ... It Was tough to see my kid.

649
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,085
There, I have all mine.

650
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,470
And it is a real phenomenon ...

651
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:08,125
We get bored with Steve!

652
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:14,021
Not the time to piss off Steve.

653
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:22,145
Well, it starts.

654
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:24,148
Buckle up, it takes off.

655
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:29,993
The cow ...

656
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,010
Bitch!

657
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,858

826
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:33,409
Bingo!

827
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,119
It Was zarb.

828
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:39,873
We Moved.

829
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:42,162
We left Laval.

830
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,539
Worse Then Richard, he HAD debts,

831
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,710
I hurried to sell, c'te home

832
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:50,669
thesis liquidate debts and the then is everything back to zero.

833
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:53,841
And this Is Where Was Steve stuffed

834
01:06:54,052 --> 01:06:57,352
in vandalism, theft, bad temper, shouting,

835
01:06:57,514 --> 01:06:59,434
bullshit ...

836
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:05,938
And the diagnosis and I fell placed.

837
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:07,357
There, I placed.

838
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:14,150
I Abebooks web sites you, you have-nots goal Answered me ...

839
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:18,371
Why you Moved to Quebec?

840
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:29,588
I know the feeling, Quebec.

841
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:33,173
Often We Went, for the job of Richard.

842
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,104
What He Was doing, Richard?

843
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:45,270
Richard, It Was in the field of the invention.

844
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:48,767
He HAD invented ...

845
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,070
I Never Understood What Was c't'affaire,

846
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:51,443
finally, if, but ...

847
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:54,819
It was a trick with microwave.

848
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:59,201
It Was the called Expired Heater-Waver.

849
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,537
You know?

850
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:05,084
The Heater-Waver! Yes I Do!

851
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:08,078
No kidding! Then Ben shit!

852

853

Everyone Had the Heater-Waver! My sister, my sister!

854
01:08:12,881 --> 01:08:14,171
Really? Oh yes ...

855
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,420
Of course!

856
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:19,472
We got the money, With That. Purpose It Was short-lived.

857
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:22,811
Because Richard Has Seen big, too ...

858
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:25,637
Aim it was great, too!

859
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:29,020
Think big is better than small, it's clear.

860
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:32,321
Worse Then the Americans arrived.

861
01:08:32,484 --> 01:08:35,404
- Are never far away, the Americans. - Are strong, the Americans.

862
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:36,820
When There is money to do ...

863
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:40,488
They put hands on it and ...

864
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:42,078
Whores of entubeurs!

865
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,040
That's it ... But the past is the past ...

866
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:06,642
The job? You are looking for?

867
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:12,355
A friend Gave me a small translation job.

868
01:09:12,524 --> 01:09:15,284

Will it help me cover up my frais NIEO, though.

870
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:24,077
NIEO, it happens Quickly, but ...

871
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:29,370
There I have a mess of furniture I know what to do with ...

872
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:31,791
They are in the basement, I have no place here.

873
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:33,497
It is an old life.

874
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,840
I have more to do with it, I think.

875
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,223
I thought I might put it on sale, what.

876
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:44,675
A great garage sale, what.

877
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:47,562
Dunno what it's worth ...

878
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:52,690
Something, something to make a small exit ...

879
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:55,356
Small lot of money left, small lot of money right,

880
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:57,275
in the end, it's a big package!

881
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,910

Beautiful or not ... I always j'dis ...

890
01:10:29,142 --> 01:10:30,482

1021
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:11,027
If not blind, if not defend ...

1022
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:16,662
Tonight we put water in our wine.

1023

American snack obese Sows off at the con?

01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:03,874

1086
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:31,754

Steve and our record is,

1088
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:42,632
It Could Be a dot on it Before It is Too flared?

1089
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:45,093
I never flared myself.

1090
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:47,551
No, gravement goal, my Paul,

1091
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:50,851

our direction

1093
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:58,899
Where one can take c't'affaire?

1094
01:27:59,066 --> 01:28:00,816
You have to Understand

1095
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:03,074
That thesis boxes in there,

1096
01:28:04,363 --> 01:28:08,123
- It's all in the angle. - Oh, yeah ...

1097
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:09,993
The angle you take.

1098
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,080
Is it this one?

1099
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:13,035
Or this one?

1100
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:14,995
I do not know. You're the boss.

01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:16,035
Or this one?

1102

Its just different, That.

1103
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:19,460
No, it's Reviews another way.

1104
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:21,418
It is fragile, it's the goal angle.

1105
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:25,468
Seriously there, why INSTEAD m'voir not you come tomorrow?

01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:28,130
I go there.

1209
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:29,916
You, you touch your ass.

I do not know your mother as much as you, Steve, but ...

1211
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:35,341
I know what is to Be a mother

1212
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:38,430
Then There is no malice in it.

1213
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,770
Y is not. It's just fear.

1214
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:42,557
This is His fear talking.

1215

I won't-have to head it on the way.

1236
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:34,698
The Following Against urn contains balls oven ...

1237
01:45:36,706 --> 01:45:38,996
numbered from 1 to 4.

1238
01:45:39,208 --> 01:45:44,838
Successively drawn without replacement and two balls of the urn.

1239
01:45:45,464 --> 01:45:46,674
Balls ...

1240
01:45:48,676 --> 01:45:52,006
That is to say, It Does not call the first ball drawn in the ballot box

1241
01:45:52,179 --> 01:45:54,179
Before drawing the second ball.

1242
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:55,518
Ball.

1243
01:45:58,686 --> 01:46:00,056
Must move forward.

1244
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:01,099
The result ...

1245
01:46:01,272 --> 01:46:03,902
It Was At That beautiful white car, Before?

1246
01:46:16,287 --> 01:46:17,367
It makes you get wasted?

1247
01:46:18,664 --> 01:46:19,914
Where do we take you, miss?

1248
01:46:20,082 --> 01:46:22,712
She is old, modern goal. There's Even a dead heat.

1249

1251
01:46:45,024 --> 01:46:48,034
That Does not happen in the life of a mother she dislikes her son.

1252
01:46:48,944 --> 01:46:50,204
You Understand that?

1253
01:46:53,449 --> 01:46:54,489

It's like that.

1259
01:47:19,058 --> 01:47:22,768
This is the natural order of things. You learn That, at a time.

1260
01:47:24,563 --> 01:47:26,313
You Understand what I say?

1261
01:47:26,482 --> 01:47:27,942

It's not for me to take care of That.

1269
01:48:08,941 --> 01:48:10,481
The back door is locked?

1270
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:19,778

02:03:21,269 --> 02:03:23,399
As she Grandma Said, When I was little,

02:03:23,563 --> 02:03:24,733
I Was not convenient.

1350

Now I Understand why she Said That.

1351
02:03:28,735 --> 02:03:30,565
So I apologize.

1352
02:03:32,238 --> 02:03:33,408
And ...

1353
02:03:37,827 --> 02:03:39,157
and when ...

1354
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:42,290
When I think of the time ...

1355
02:03:44,626 --> 02:03:47,796
and when to I think of the times I've maybe done wrong ...

1356
02:03:49,297 --> 02:03:53,047
later, when i go back down and I calm ...

1357
02:03:55,720 --> 02:03:57,510
It Gives me the fucking balls

1358
02:03:57,680 --> 02:04:01,060
Because You really deserve better than a calibrated Mongolian like me.

You know I've Lived in Toronto me?

1388
02:06:13,983 --> 02:06:15,823
It's for ages, for cons.

1389
02:06:17,070 --> 02:06:19,360
It was just Before Steve Was Born.

1390
02:06:19,530 --> 02:06:23,530

1391

I Had a nice big book filled That I Could give you.

1392
02:06:28,456 --> 02:06:30,576
Because Toronto, it's no air,

1393
02:06:31,417 --> 02:06:34,917
goal if you do not know well, it Can Be boring to death.

1394
02:06:35,421 --> 02:06:37,131
Goal I Had full address ...

1395
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:41,390
Good restaurants, good shopping, not tourist stuff.

1396
02:06:41,886 --> 02:06:44,966
It is not possible, That I Threw That.

1397
02:06:45,515 --> 02:06:47,425
When are you going?

1398
02:06:47,934 --> 02:06:50,484
Well, that's it ... We had to leave in two months.

1399
02:06:52,355 --> 02:06:53,765

It's been ... suggéré weekend in two weeks.

1401
02:07:01,322 --> 02:07:02,662
But is ...

1402
02:07:02,907 --> 02:07:04,447

02:07:27,390 --> 02:07:29,180
You have to be happy!

1410
02:07:35,398 --> 02:07:37,818
I admit I did not think You Would react like that.

1411
02:07:41,195 --> 02:07:44,905
How do you want me to responds? It's heavy!

02:08:00,173 --> 02:08:02,383
But still, take at least one beer.

1417
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:04,510
Or just eat tonight.

1418
02:08:04,677 --> 02:08:07,467
In fact, all my apples are eaten by bugs,

1419
02:08:07,638 --> 02:08:10,768
They All Fell, Almost. I Could make a good pie.

1420

02:08:23,780 --> 02:08:24,740
Since the time.

1425
02:08:39,504 --> 02:08:41,094
I do not want you to think

1426
02:08:41,255 --> 02:08:44,335
That It Has not-been significant to me in recent months.

1427
02:08:45,510 --> 02:08:46,640
With you.

1428
02:08:47,845 --> 02:08:49,005
Me too.

1429
02:08:49,597 --> 02:08:51,887
Me too. It Was important.

1430
02:08:52,058 --> 02:08:53,268
We had a blast!

1431
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:56,600
It Has cracked the mouth confess!

1432
02:08:57,563 --> 02:09:00,273
It makes us good to us too, you're here.

1433
02:09:00,858 --> 02:09:02,068
In my life.

1434
02:09:02,652 --> 02:09:05,202
You kiffes you more pies or crumbles?

1435
02:09:22,839 --> 02:09:25,259
It's just That I can not give up ...

1436
02:09:29,303 --> 02:09:30,723
... Leave my family.

1437
02:09:43,901 --> 02:09:45,991
This is not what I meant.

1438
02:10:02,545 --> 02:10:03,665
You know, Kyla ...

1439
02:10:07,133 --> 02:10:09,183
Each Was how we manage.

1440
02:10:10,511 --> 02:10:13,721
You manages your life, I manages my own. It's like that.

1441
02:10:20,146 --> 02:10:21,646
If I Placed it there ...

1442
02:10:25,776 --> 02:10:27,816
It Is Because I have hope.

1443
02:10:29,238 --> 02:10:31,988
You dig? I am hopeful, okay?

1444
02:10:37,788 --> 02:10:40,368
The world is a place Where There is not much hope.

1445
02:10:41,542 --> 02:10:43,042
Purpose think ... I love it

1446
02:10:45,254 --> 02:10:49,014
it is full of people, full of hope, That hope.

1447
02:10:52,386 --> 02:10:55,886
And that's damn good to us Because We Can change things.

1448
02:10:56,474 --> 02:10:58,644
A world full of hope with Many People Hoping more

1449
02:10:58,809 --> 02:11:01,769
It Does not give much. You go not far away, like that.

1450
02:11:03,481 --> 02:11:05,151
I did what I did ...

1451
02:11:09,612 --> 02:11:12,492
Because, like this, There is hope. OK?

1452
02:11:19,830 --> 02:11:21,000
So I win.

1453
02:11:24,752 --> 02:11:25,962
Down the line.

1454
02:11:28,339 --> 02:11:31,629
I go out winning this. Everyone wins.

1455
02:11:36,222 --> 02:11:37,352
So ...

1456

Pie or crumble? What you want?

1459
02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:32,710
Micheline not working tonight.

1460
02:13:33,339 --> 02:13:35,379

She tries to save Him, like ...

1470
02:13:57,822 --> 02:13:59,322
Fucking human kind, man.
