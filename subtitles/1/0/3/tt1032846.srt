Made by Dragos

2
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
OK

3
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:22,001
Thanks.

4
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:40,008
Could you help me?

5
00:01:58,015 --> 00:02:00,015
Did Marius gave you this fish bowl, like this?

6
00:01:59,015 --> 00:02:01,015
There are other fish.

7
00:02:03,017 --> 00:02:05,017
What a weird picture.

8
00:02:05,017 --> 00:02:07,017
Listen, can you ask Daniela to feed them while we're away?

9
00:02:06,018 --> 00:02:08,018
They're just fish. Nothing can happen if they are not fed a couple of days.

10
00:02:19,023 --> 00:02:21,023
Did you take the toothpaste?

11
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:24,024
Yes, and some cotton absorbent too. You'll get another.

12
00:02:28,026 --> 00:02:30,026
-Do you have some soap left? -Check in the drawer.

13
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,028
-There is no more.

14
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,028
-I'll get it for you. I'll be out for cigarettes anyway.

15
00:02:36,029 --> 00:02:38,029
-Get some Amo or Lux. No more Palmolive, I got dandruff because of it.

16
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:45,031
-Could you go to Petronela and get my hairdryer?

17
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,033
-You're packing as if you're mountain tripping.

18
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:51,033
-Do you have any money left?

19
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:54,035
-Check the jeans. It's a wallet in the backpocket.

20
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:58,036
-That's where you keep your money, in a wallet?

21
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:59,036
-Better than hanging out of the pockets like you're used to.

22
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,039
-Close the damn door. It's draught.

23
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:14,042
-Did you see Petronela? -She was in the shower earlier.

24
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:25,046
-Hot water? -Yup

25
00:03:25,047 --> 00:03:27,047
-Petronela? -Not in here.

26
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:29,047
-Otilia? -Yea.

27
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:31,048
-What is it?

28
00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:38,051
-The teacher noticed you were not around on Thursday.

29
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,052
-Didn't I ask you to bail me out?

30
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:45,053
-I tried. But she said she heard that one two weeks ago.

31
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:46,053
-She said you'd better bring a waiver. -I will

32
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:53,056
-Does she smoke? - Vikent.

33
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:06,061
-It's open.

34
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:12,063
-Morning. Did you start already?

35
00:04:13,064 --> 00:04:15,064
-It's wednesday. With the lecturer.

36
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:18,065
-'The thorn birds' with Richard Chamberlain. Tonight if you want.

37
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:23,067
-How is Gabi? -She's depilating.

38
00:04:23,068 --> 00:04:25,068
-I want an Assos and a Kent. -Don't have Kent.

39
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:28,069
-Where can I find some? - You can't, I got some Marlboro instead.

40
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,070
- What am I to do with it? Give me an Assos and a Lux.

41
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,075
-Anything else? -A Tictac. An orange one.

42
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:52,077
-That's on me. -Thanks.

43
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,079
-If you change your mind, you're wellcome tonight. Ramona is coming too.

44
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,080
-Not really.

45
00:05:08,084 --> 00:05:10,084
-They're so cute. Are they yours?

46
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:13,085
-No, I found them yesterday near the powerstation. Do you want one?

47
00:05:14,086 --> 00:05:16,086
-I can't. Gabi is allergic to cats.

48
00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:19,087
-What do you feed them? - Some dumplings yesterday night.

49
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:21,088
- I'll get some powder milk for them. - Thanks.

50
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,090
-Hey girls. Tell Gabi her father phoned and said he'll be here tomorrow around 10.

51
00:05:31,092 --> 00:05:33,092
-I'll tell her. -Thanks.

52
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:37,094
-Your father called. He'll be here. -Damn.

53
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:43,096
-Did you tell you parents? -Tell them what?

54
00:05:44,097 --> 00:05:46,097
-He's supposed to be here at 10.

55
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,100
-I can't figure out what to do about this exam.

56
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:56,101
- You'll take it another day.

57
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:58,102
-Should I take some notes to read?

58
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:01,103
-No point to do that.

59
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:10,106
-Didn't you have some powder milk? -It's in the nesscaffee can.

00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:52,121
-And the blister? -25.

66
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:55,122
-Progesterol. Is it good?

67
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,123
-German, made in Hungary under license.

68
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:58,123
-How come you know?

69
00:06:58,124 --> 00:07:00,124
-My cousin told me. She uses them, not me.  I'm too fat anyway

70
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:07,127
-Expensive. Do you find any buyers?

71
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:08,127
-No doubt about it. Instantly.

72
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:13,129
-I'm leaving. I have to dye my hair. Red head

73
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,130
-Really? -Kidding, actually I put on nut concoction cause my hair is thinning

74
00:07:17,131 --> 00:07:19,131
-Hey, can you tell Petronela to bring the hair dryer?

75
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:22,132
-She's taking an exam. I'll bring it later.

76
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,133
-Bye, good luck. -Bye

77
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:35,137
-When are you going to meet Adi? -At 11.

78
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,140
-I think I have fever. -Take an aspirin.

79
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:49,142
-I think it's my bad tooth. I need painkillers. Vial painkillers.

80
00:07:49,143 --> 00:07:51,143
-Check the kit. Maybe there is some left.

81
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,147
-What a bad timing. I have an appointment at the dentist.

82
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:04,147
-No time for that.

83
00:08:05,148 --> 00:08:07,148
-Can I ask you something? -Say it.

84
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,150
-Could you deal with the money part? You know I am not even able to bribe a ticket collector.

85
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:14,151
-I'll deal with it.

86
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:26,155
-Here is the money, count it.-2700, right?

87
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:27,156
-Yes.

88
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,159
-My stomach aches. -Eat something.

89
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
- Eat what?I can't eat anything.

90
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:41,161
-Don't worry. Everything will be allright.

91
00:08:45,163 --> 00:08:47,163
-Come on, enough. Bye

92
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,166
-Don't turn back. It bodes bad. -I forgot the adress.

93
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,167
-Stop being superstitious. You're not from the country side.

94
00:09:00,168 --> 00:09:02,168
-You know something, I'll bring some notes with me after all.

95
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:03,169
-Then bring them.

96
00:09:41,183 --> 00:09:43,183
-Tickets please! Let me see your tickets please.

97
00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:58,189
-Do you have a spare ticket? - No.

98
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:59,189
-Tickets please

99
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:53,209
-Excuse me. Did Ady get in?

100
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:06,214
-What are you doing? Learning?

101
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:08,214
-Perusing those abstracts.

102
00:11:07,215 --> 00:11:09,215
-Did anyone get in?

103
00:11:10,216 --> 00:11:12,216
-It started late. They couldn't find the key to the classroom.

104
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,219
-Stop. Your classmates can see us.

105
00:11:20,219 --> 00:11:22,219
-So what? - I'm embarrassed.

106
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:27,221
-Listen, Diana asked if we wanted to swap the trips.

107
00:11:27,222 --> 00:11:29,222
-So that she goes to Izvor and we go to Costinesti.

108
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:31,223
-The same timetable? -Not really.

109
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:35,224
- 7-14 Izvor, 15-22 Costinesti,

110
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:37,225
-I have the last exam on the sixth.

111
00:11:39,226 --> 00:11:41,226
-Then I'll have to go home for a week and then return.

112
00:11:41,227 --> 00:11:43,227
-I don't know, it's rather complicated.

113
00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:48,229
-You did remember about the money, didn't you? -Yea, sure.

114
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:53,231
- You give it  to me in an envelope or what?

115
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:55,231
- I wanted to keep it separated from the money for the flowers.

116
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:03,234
- 300, right? - I'll give it back when I get my scholarship.

117
00:12:05,236 --> 00:12:07,236
- Are you hungry? Do you want me to get you something?

118
00:12:07,236 --> 00:12:09,236
- My mother packed some cookies for me.

119
00:12:09,237 --> 00:12:11,237
-She woke up in the morning to make cookies for you?

120
00:12:11,238 --> 00:12:13,238
-She woke up to prepare the merengue cake, cause after 8 the gas pressure drops.

121
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:17,239
- Please get the flowers for my mother. I think I'll be stranded here all day.

122
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,240
- I don't think I...  can make it.

123
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:29,244
- Where...?  Are you telling me you won't be able to attend my mother's birthday?

124
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:37,247
- Don't be angry with me. - I am. She's making your favourite cake and you don't come?

125
00:12:40,248 --> 00:12:42,248
- You told her to make it for me? -I did, and she made the cake.

126
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:44,249
- It's just that I can't, not that I don't want to.

127
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,250
- What do you mean you can't? What is it you have to do? Say it.

128
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:52,252
- I can't tell you now. You can't tell me now?

129
00:12:54,254 --> 00:12:56,254
-Don't you trust me? Say it if you don't.

130
00:12:58,255 --> 00:13:00,255
- It's not about that. I just don't understand why you can't come. Do you keep secrets from me?

131
00:13:01,256 --> 00:13:03,256
- I have no secrets. I'll tell you later, that's all.

132
00:13:02,257 --> 00:13:04,257
- Why is it such an issue?

133
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:10,259
- Ok, if you don't find it an issue, I don't know what else to say.

134
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:15,261
- If I had to come to your place for the first time and I had forgotten about it, that would have been an issue.

135
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,261
- Come on, I don't want to argue with you.

136
00:13:20,263 --> 00:13:22,263
- Who started it? I asked to get some flowers for my mother and you say you don't want to come.

137
00:13:24,265 --> 00:13:26,265
- Fine, I'll come. I 'll find a way and I'll make it.

138
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,267
- You're making me a favor now. - Hey, will you stop? do you want me to come or not?

139
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:34,267
- The professor would like you to speak a little lower, ok?

140
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,270
- What kind of flowers do you want? - Don't take  anything.

141
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:47,272
- Tell me. Do you want carnations?

142
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:54,275
- Get some gladioles. - How many?

143
00:13:55,276 --> 00:13:57,276
- 48. - I can't, they're even.

144
00:13:57,277 --> 00:13:59,277
- Then how many? - Don't now. 49 maybe.

145
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,279
- She'll say I don't her age if I get 49.

146
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,280
- Who's counting, anyway? - You don't know my mother.

147
00:14:12,282 --> 00:14:14,282
- Get 47 then. I don't know. Do as you please. I'll just take how many you want.

148
00:14:17,284 --> 00:14:19,284
- Listen, we won't get too formal, are we?

149
00:14:21,285 --> 00:14:23,285
- Don't worry. Some friends of my father will come, but that's all.

150
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:24,286
- We'll have a glass of champaigne and then go to my room.

151
00:14:14,283 --> 00:14:16,283
- Ok, I'll manage one way or another and I'll come.

152
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:29,287
- No, you'll come good and proper. At 5.

153
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:32,289
No delays

154
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,290
- You're starting to annoy me. I'm never late.

155
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,291
- Unless something unforseen pops up, in wich case everybody is late.

156
00:14:41,293 --> 00:14:43,293
- Ady,do you your report card with you? They won't allow us without it. - Yes

157
00:14:43,293 --> 00:14:45,293
- I'm leaving.

158
00:14:46,294 --> 00:14:48,294
-  What's the time? - Past twenty. Do you need mine?

159
00:14:49,295 --> 00:14:51,295
- No, no , keep it.

160
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:52,296
 - See you later.

161
00:14:53,297 --> 00:14:55,297
- Don't you kiss me? - No, cause you've upset me

162
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,300
- Don't upset me anymore. - You too.

163
00:15:04,301 --> 00:15:06,301
- Bye. - Bye.

164
00:15:12,304 --> 00:15:14,304
- How can I get a pack of Kent cigarettes?

165
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:16,305
- Why didn't you tell me. I would have brought it for you.

166
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:20,306
- I need it for Gabi. Go to Unirea, you'll find some black marketers.

167
00:15:22,307 --> 00:15:24,307
- Bye.

168
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,313
- Hello.

169
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,314
- I'm listening.

170
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:44,315
- I have a booking. On the name Dragut.

171
00:15:46,316 --> 00:15:48,316
- You have a booking here. Since when?

172
00:15:47,317 --> 00:15:49,317
- Today. Tonight, I mean.

173
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:51,317
- What I want to know is when did you made it?.

174
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,318
- Since last Tuesday.

175
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:02,321
- There is nothing here.

176
00:16:05,323 --> 00:16:07,323
- A friend of mine made it. I know for sure it was Monday, or Tuesday.

177
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:09,324
- Do you know who did she talked to?

178
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:12,325
- No, but I 've heard she gave her name and adress.

179
00:16:13,326 --> 00:16:15,326
- What was the name again?

180
00:16:14,326 --> 00:16:16,326
- Dragut.

181
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,330
- Nope. There is no Dragut in here.

182
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:32,332
- Listen, go find Nelu for me.

183
00:16:35,334 --> 00:16:37,334
- Maybe my colleague knows you.

184
00:16:37,335 --> 00:16:39,335
- I told you it wasn't me who booked the room.

185
00:16:40,336 --> 00:16:42,336
- My friend called and a man answered.

186
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:44,337
- On the phone. So she didn't come here personally?

187
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,338
- I don't know exactly. I guess she called.

188
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:49,338
- Anyone can call.

189
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:55,341
- Was the reservation confirmed? Yesterday?

190
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:57,341
- What to confirm it for?

191
00:16:58,342 --> 00:17:00,342
- I would really like you to talk in a civilised manner.

192
00:17:01,343 --> 00:17:03,343
- The resevation has to be confirmed at least 24 hours prior.

193
00:17:03,344 --> 00:17:05,344
- The man she talk to didn't mention anything like this.

194
00:17:04,345 --> 00:17:06,345
- I doubt he didn't.

195
00:17:11,347 --> 00:17:13,347
- Nelu....

196
00:17:14,348 --> 00:17:16,348
No... It hurts.

197
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,350
There is someone here who says you've booked a room for her yesterday.

198
00:17:21,351 --> 00:17:23,351
- Not yesterday, tuesday.

199
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:25,351
- Or tuesday.

200
00:17:26,353 --> 00:17:28,353
- Ok, What was the name again?

201
00:17:29,354 --> 00:17:31,354
 - Dragut.

202
00:17:30,354 --> 00:17:32,354
- Dragut(Nice), ha, that's the name allright.

203
00:17:34,355 --> 00:17:36,355
- Yea, thanks.

204
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,356
- Listen, could you call me if they send the pay check?

205
00:17:39,357 --> 00:17:41,357
- Ok, fine.

206
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:47,359
- No, if the reservation had been made I would have find it.

207
00:17:48,361 --> 00:17:50,361
- So, what do we do now?

208
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:51,361
- Do what now?

209
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:55,362
- Is anyone serving in the shop?

210
00:17:54,363 --> 00:17:56,363
- In a minute.

211
00:17:58,364 --> 00:18:00,364
- We really need a room. Please, let's tackle this

212
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:05,366
- Tackle what miss? There is a delegation from Bucharest who arrived yesterday. The whole place is full.

213
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:06,366
- Do you understand?

214
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:08,367
- Anything. I don't mind if it has 3 beds.

215
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:12,369
- Can't you understand Romanian? It seems you don't.

216
00:18:19,372 --> 00:18:21,372
- Do you have Kent?

217
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:22,372
- 80, a pack.

218
00:18:59,386 --> 00:19:01,386
- We have a delegation on the way. See what you can do.

219
00:19:04,388 --> 00:19:06,388
- Ok, I can't talk anymore. I call you back. Bye, bye.

220
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:13,391
- I'm listening.

221
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:16,392
- Hello. I'd like a room starting tonight.

222
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:20,393
- Tonight?

223
00:19:19,394 --> 00:19:21,394
 - Yes, please.

224
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,394
- Everything is taken.

225
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,395
- I don't mind if it has 3 beds.

226
00:19:25,396 --> 00:19:27,396
- Can you call Marcu here, please.

227
00:19:30,398 --> 00:19:32,398
- How many nights?

228
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:35,399
- Two, but it could take longer.

229
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:41,401
- Today... not really.

230
00:19:44,403 --> 00:19:46,403
 We have a room but startig tomorrow

231
00:19:47,404 --> 00:19:49,404
- But we really need it tonight, please.

232
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:50,404
- How many? - Two.

233
00:19:51,405 --> 00:19:53,405
- With double bed. - Doesn't matter.

234
00:19:58,408 --> 00:20:00,408
- Yes? - Go to the bar and get two coffees to that table.

235
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,409
- Is it neckezol or ness?

236
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,410
- Just go. She knows what to give you.

237
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:09,411
 Tell her it's for me.

238
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:16,414
- So, can you help me?

239
00:20:18,415 --> 00:20:20,415
- I don't really know. He hasn't confirmed the resevation until now, but still...

240
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,416
- Please, I'm begging you.

241
00:20:29,419 --> 00:20:31,419
- It's a double bed, did I tell you?

242
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,420
- It's ok.

243
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:35,421
- Do you have an ID?

244
00:20:39,423 --> 00:20:41,423
- You have a temporary adress here. Are you a student?

245
00:20:40,423 --> 00:20:42,423
- Yes

246
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:44,424
- If you stay at the student hostel why do you need a room here?

247
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:48,425
- We're six in the room. During exams it gets kind of crowdy.

248
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:54,428
- Two persons.

249
00:20:53,428 --> 00:20:55,428
- Yes

250
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:58,429
We have another room with 4 beds if you'd like

251
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,430
But if you don't pay the whole room I might have to bring in someone else.

252
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:04,431
- No need to, really. - It's better with 4.

253
00:21:04,432 --> 00:21:06,432
- No, thanks. - As you wish.

254
00:20:09,412 --> 00:20:11,412
- I can't spell the name, Miha...  - Mihatescu with a T.

255
00:21:12,435 --> 00:21:14,435
- You better change this ID. The Police won't be happy with this.

256
00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:17,436
- I forgot it in the jeans when I washed them, that's why it's not clear.

257
00:21:18,437 --> 00:21:20,437
- The other person? Dragut(Nice).

258
00:21:20,438 --> 00:21:22,438
- That's the actual name, Dragut.

259
00:21:22,438 --> 00:21:24,438
- Is she a lady also?

260
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:25,439
- Yes,

261
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
she has that problem at school too... Dragut Gabriela.

262
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:35,442
- 186 lei. -How much?

263
00:21:35,443 --> 00:21:37,443
- 186

264
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
- Excuse me, how much you charge a night?

265
00:21:40,445 --> 00:21:42,445
- It's there for all to see. Double bed, 62 lei.

266
00:21:43,446 --> 00:21:45,446
- Can't we pay for only one night?

267
00:21:47,448 --> 00:21:49,448
- I've already given you someone else's reservation. If you don't like it...

268
00:21:48,448 --> 00:21:50,448
- Fine, fine.

269
00:21:56,451 --> 00:21:58,451
- Your day starts at 12. When your not in the room, you leave the key at the counter.

270
00:21:57,451 --> 00:21:59,451
- Ok.

271
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,452
Thanks.

272
00:20:11,413 --> 00:20:13,413
- P 14. Hello.

273
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:16,457
- I'm not sure she's here anymore.

274
00:22:23,461 --> 00:22:25,461
- Ok , I'll go. Will you wait over the phone?

275
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:36,465
- Gabitza?

276
00:22:36,465 --> 00:22:38,465
- I've got the room

277
00:22:38,466 --> 00:22:40,466
- But not at Unirea, at Tineretului.

278
00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:44,468
- She said it was no reservation, nothing.

279
00:22:45,469 --> 00:22:47,469
- I told them, but...

280
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,470
- That's the way it is.

281
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:53,471
He'll understand.

282
00:22:55,472 --> 00:22:57,472
- Listen, the room costs here 186 lei.

283
00:22:58,473 --> 00:23:00,473
- It's a double bed. I couldn't find anything better.

284
00:23:02,475 --> 00:23:04,475
- Why didn't you look for a room yourself? You're starting to annoy me.

285
00:23:08,477 --> 00:23:10,477
- Listen, find someone to lend you another 200 lei.

286
00:23:11,478 --> 00:23:13,478
You're a big girl,you'll manage.

287
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:16,479
- Just go and ask. Go.

288
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,481
- I'll leave the key at the counter, ok?

289
00:23:23,482 --> 00:23:25,482
- Listen, how can I recognise that man?

290
00:23:26,484 --> 00:23:28,484
- How can he recognise me?

291
00:23:32,486 --> 00:23:34,486
- Are you insane, Gabitza?

292
00:23:35,487 --> 00:23:37,487
How is he going to recognise me, if you described yourself?

293
00:23:38,488 --> 00:23:40,488
- You are something, you know.

294
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:43,489
Ok, I'll see what I can do.

295
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,490
- Be sure you have your ID with you.

296
00:23:47,491 --> 00:23:49,491
- Bye, bye.

297
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,510
- Excuse me. No 24?

298
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,510
- Who are you looking for?

299
00:24:44,512 --> 00:24:46,512
- I'm supposed to meet someone here. He gave me this adress. Decebal, 24.

300
00:24:58,517 --> 00:25:00,517
- Did you see anyone waiting here?

301
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:21,459
- No.

302
00:25:01,518 --> 00:25:03,518
- Is there a man called Bebe working here?

303
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,519
- Bebe who?

304
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,520
- Don't know. All I know is he's mr. Bebe.

305
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:11,521
- Don't know. Ask the boys at the service.

306
00:25:12,522 --> 00:25:14,522
 But I don't know any Bebe here.

307
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,528
- Excuse me. Mr Bebe?

308
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,529
- Miss Gabi?

309
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,530
- She couldn't make it. She's not very well

310
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,530
- My name is Otilia.

311
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,530
- We agreed on the phone she will come.

312
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:41,532
- I know. That's why I was afraid we won't recognise each other.

313
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:43,533
- I tried to ask some people.

314
00:25:42,533 --> 00:25:44,533
- Ask what?

315
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:48,534
-If there was someone waiting for me.

316
00:25:49,536 --> 00:25:51,536
- Cause I was late and I thought I lost you.

317
00:25:51,536 --> 00:25:53,536
- We're going with your car?

318
00:25:54,537 --> 00:25:56,537
- Where is she? - At the hotel, she's waiting for us.

319
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:06,541
- Shut the door properly.

320
00:26:12,544 --> 00:26:14,544
- Do you work here?

321
00:26:14,545 --> 00:26:16,545
- Where do I work?

322
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:18,545
- Just asking.

323
00:26:19,546 --> 00:26:21,546
- May I smoke in here?

324
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:24,548
- Miss, listen here.

325
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:26,548
- I have nothing to hide.

326
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,550
- You've seen, I've come with my car, you can note the license plates if you want.

327
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,552
- But, let me tell you something. I work by trust here.

328
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:41,554
- I look at the person and I can tell if it's going to work or not.

329
00:26:41,554 --> 00:26:43,554
- You can trust me, really.

330
00:26:44,556 --> 00:26:46,556
- She didn't feel allright and she couldn't come.

331
00:26:49,557 --> 00:26:51,557
- We tried to contact you through Ramona, but she went home.

332
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:53,558
- And we had no phone number of yours to contact you.

333
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,560
- It doesn't matter. I just told you.

334
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,560
At what hotel are you lodged?

335
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
- Tineretului.

336
00:27:01,562 --> 00:27:03,562
- Listen, When I talk to your friend, I had a request.

337
00:27:05,563 --> 00:27:07,563
- To book a room at Unirea or Moldova.

338
00:27:09,565 --> 00:27:11,565
- She told me. But if there weren't any room what was I to do?

339
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:13,565
I had a hard time even at Tineretului until  I got the room.

340
00:27:18,568 --> 00:27:20,568
- Has your sister done this previously?

341
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:22,569
- My sister? No.

342
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:23,569
- How old is she?

343
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,570
-22, She'll be 23 this march.

344
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,570
- Many happy returns of the day

345
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:29,571
- Do you live together?

346
00:27:28,572 --> 00:27:30,572
- Yes.

347
00:27:29,572 --> 00:27:31,572
- You're not from here, are you?

348
00:27:31,573 --> 00:27:33,573
- No.

349
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:34,573
- Where are you from?

350
00:27:34,574 --> 00:27:36,574
- Campulung.

351
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,576
- Never been there.

352
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,576
- You didn't miss anything.

353
00:27:43,577 --> 00:27:45,577
- Do you have a rented room?

354
00:27:44,577 --> 00:27:46,577
- No, at the hostel.

355
00:27:45,578 --> 00:27:47,578
- How is it there?

356
00:27:49,579 --> 00:27:51,579
- Lot of noise. You can hardly learn.

357
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,580
- Where do you studying?

358
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,580
- Polytehnics

359
00:27:56,582 --> 00:27:58,582
- Not bad, you don't have to go to the country side.

360
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:00,583
- Yea, right.

361
00:28:02,584 --> 00:28:04,584
- I have to make a detour to drop something.

362
00:28:41,598 --> 00:28:43,598
- Wait here.

363
00:28:57,604 --> 00:28:59,604
- What are you doing outside?

364
00:29:01,605 --> 00:29:03,605
- How many times did I tell you not to go out when I'm missing?

365
00:29:02,606 --> 00:29:04,606
- Why did you have to go out?

366
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:06,607
- Miss Iancu told me they brought sugar at...

367
00:29:07,608 --> 00:29:09,608
- Forget the sugar. What do you need that for?

368
00:29:08,608 --> 00:29:10,608
- It's not for me.

369
00:29:11,609 --> 00:29:13,609
- I don't any sugar, understand?

370
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,610
- I just don't want to see you out, you drive me crazy.

371
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:19,611
- It's the third time this month you lock yourself outside.

372
00:29:19,612 --> 00:29:21,612
- The wind slamed the door.

373
00:29:21,613 --> 00:29:23,613
- The fucking draught, huh?

374
00:29:26,615 --> 00:29:28,615
- Here it is. Lose this one too, cause this is the last I have.

375
00:29:28,615 --> 00:29:30,615
- Don't worry son, I won't lose it.

376
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:33,616
- Why do you have to get in the street, what do you need?

377
00:29:33,617 --> 00:29:35,617
- Do you want to catch a cold or what?

378
00:29:36,618 --> 00:29:38,618
- Miss Iancu had to go to the complex so as not to lose her place in the line.

379
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:39,619
- So why didn't she let you in the house?

380
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,620
She was afraid you'd steal from her?

381
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,620
- No, no.... - I'll have a talk with her too.

382
00:29:45,621 --> 00:29:47,621
Now get in the house.

383
00:29:47,622 --> 00:29:49,622
-But she kept a place in the line for me.

384
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:51,623
- Forget the line. Go inside.

385
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:55,624
- Ok, I'll go. - Right now. So I can see you getting in.

386
00:30:01,627 --> 00:30:03,627
- Don't you need anything to eat?

387
00:30:03,628 --> 00:30:05,628
- Just go in and forget the rest.

388
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:12,631
- Viorel, someone called you on the phone.

389
00:30:12,631 --> 00:30:14,631
- On the phone?

390
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:18,633
How many times do I have to tell you not to answear the phone when I'm away?

391
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:34,639
- Hey, where do you think you're going?

392
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,640
- 206, It has already been paid for.

393
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,640
- Didn't anyone tell you to leave the key at the counter when you leave the hotel?

394
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:41,641
- There is someone in the room waiting for us.

395
00:30:42,642 --> 00:30:44,642
- What's the number? -206

396
00:30:47,644 --> 00:30:49,644
- Dragut Gabriela? -Yes.

397
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:51,645
- She's already in the room.

398
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:57,647
- And him? - He's visting.

399
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,648
- Didn't they tell you visits have to be anounced? Do you think you can come in just like that?

400
00:30:59,648 --> 00:31:01,648
- I thought only after 22.

401
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:02,649
- Your colleague told me

402
00:31:06,651 --> 00:31:08,651
- You didn't understand. If he stays after 22 he has to pay the room.

403
00:31:07,651 --> 00:31:09,651
Visits have to be anounced regardless.

404
00:31:09,652 --> 00:31:11,652
- Do you have an ID?

405
00:31:11,653 --> 00:31:13,653
- May I take these?

406
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:18,655
- You take it when you come down.

407
00:31:25,658 --> 00:31:27,658
- 206.

408
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,662
- Gabitza?

409
00:31:42,664 --> 00:31:44,664
I'm with mr Bebe.

410
00:31:53,668 --> 00:31:55,668
- Hello. Gabriela. - Hello

411
00:31:54,668 --> 00:31:56,668
- Come in.

412
00:32:01,671 --> 00:32:03,671
- Did you get the money?

413
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,671
- When?

414
00:32:05,672 --> 00:32:07,672
- Want a coffee? - No, thanks.

415
00:32:07,673 --> 00:32:09,673
- Some cookies? - No.

416
00:32:09,674 --> 00:32:11,674
- They are good, home made.

417
00:32:12,675 --> 00:32:14,675
- Take a seat, please.

418
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,679
- It's good you've meet.

419
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:26,679
- I thought you wouldn't recognise each other.

420
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,680
- Miss, I think we've started all wrong.

421
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,681
- I've head two requests over the phone.

422
00:32:33,683 --> 00:32:35,683
- Firsly, book a room at Unirea or Moldova.

423
00:32:35,683 --> 00:32:37,683
- Secondly, to show up alone.

424
00:32:38,684 --> 00:32:40,684
- Do you think I told you this, just to....

425
00:32:43,686 --> 00:32:45,686
- No. I understood what you asked, but I couldn't find anywhere else.

426
00:32:47,688 --> 00:32:49,688
- Miss, you couldn't find. Then we should have meet when you found.

427
00:32:49,688 --> 00:32:51,688
- Now, my ID is downstairs.

428
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,690
- I'm sorry.

429
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:58,691
- You can be sorry all you want but my ID is at the counter.

430
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:03,693
- I thought I'd better not postpone it anymore. I already did that too many times.

431
00:33:03,693 --> 00:33:05,693
- What month are you?

432
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:07,694
- The third.

433
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:08,695
- You said the second on the phone.

434
00:33:11,696 --> 00:33:13,696
- When we talked I was in the second. Now I'm in the third.

435
00:33:14,697 --> 00:33:16,697
- What blood type do you have?

436
00:33:15,698 --> 00:33:17,698
- 0 I

437
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:20,699
- Are you hypotensive?

438
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:26,701
- No... I don't...

439
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:27,701
- Are you allergic to anything?

440
00:33:33,704 --> 00:33:35,704
- Just to cat hair. Not to much. Some redness around the neck, that's all.

441
00:33:34,705 --> 00:33:36,705
- Are you going to use anaesthetics?

442
00:33:35,705 --> 00:33:37,705
- Miss...

443
00:33:37,706 --> 00:33:39,706
- I'm asking cause I don't really know how it's done.

444
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:45,708
- A friend of mine who also... interrupted that she has been administered anaesthetics

445
00:33:46,709 --> 00:33:48,709
- Have you ever had an abortion?

446
00:33:54,712 --> 00:33:56,712
Let's get something straight. I'm not going to rake you.

447
00:33:54,712 --> 00:33:56,712
We didn't agree to that and it's no need for that.

448
00:33:58,713 --> 00:34:00,713
I just place a probe in and a spontaneous abortion ensues.

449
00:34:05,716 --> 00:34:07,716
Of course, there is some bleeding, we have to be cautious with the haemorhage

450
00:34:07,717 --> 00:34:09,717
but there is no anaesthesia involved

451
00:34:09,717 --> 00:34:11,717
I mean it doesn't hurt that bad so it doesn't need anaesthetics.

452
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:13,718
And more there are no facilities here.

453
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,720
You make perform anaesthesia in a hospital, not whereever you like.

454
00:34:20,721 --> 00:34:22,721
It's very important to stand still all the time the probe is in.

455
00:34:25,723 --> 00:34:27,723
so as not to break off or fall cause I'm not inserting it again.

456
00:34:27,724 --> 00:34:29,724
I put it once and that's it, understood?

457
00:34:31,725 --> 00:34:33,725
How did you think it's going to be?

458
00:34:35,727 --> 00:34:37,727
I thought you made up your mind since you've called me.

459
00:34:37,728 --> 00:34:39,728
- I did, but...

460
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:40,728
- But what?

461
00:34:41,729 --> 00:34:43,729
Miss, we're not playing here.

462
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,730
We could end up in jail for what we're doing here.

463
00:34:49,732 --> 00:34:51,732
You get in but I do as well.

464
00:34:48,732 --> 00:34:50,732
Just that I' ll be worse.

465
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:53,733
We're not playing, ok?

466
00:34:55,734 --> 00:34:57,734
Once we let it roll there is no turning back.

467
00:35:02,737 --> 00:35:04,737
If everything goes right, after I place the probe, bleeding will occur,

468
00:35:03,737 --> 00:35:05,737
and you will expel the foetus.

469
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:08,738
It's very important how you act afterwards

470
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,740
You need someone to help you, because the haemorhage may be heavy.

471
00:35:14,741 --> 00:35:16,741
And God forbid you spill blood all over the place, cause we're in big trouble then.

472
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:18,742
That's why I asked you to bring some oilcloth.

473
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,743
- I... forgot it at the hostel

474
00:35:24,745 --> 00:35:26,745
-You forgot it at the hostel.

475
00:35:29,747 --> 00:35:31,747
Then...put a plastic bag or something, I don't know.

476
00:35:35,749 --> 00:35:37,749
And again, don't let anyone come in

477
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,750
Room sevice, anyone, keep the door closed at all times

478
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:42,751
- Do you know how much time it takes?

479
00:35:43,752 --> 00:35:45,752
I mean since you place the probe until...

480
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:47,752
cause we've rented the room for 3 days.

481
00:35:50,754 --> 00:35:52,754
- It depends. It can take 2 hours as well as 2 or 3 days.

482
00:35:52,755 --> 00:35:54,755
It dependson how the human body will react.

483
00:35:54,756 --> 00:35:56,756
-What if I need to go to the toilet?

484
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:01,758
- Can't you understand it'very important not to move out of the bed at all?

485
00:36:03,759 --> 00:36:05,759
If the probe fell, we achieved nothing.

486
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,760
I'm not putting it again, I told you.

487
00:36:10,762 --> 00:36:12,762
That's why I told on the phone it's very important to have someone to help you.a friend or..

488
00:36:15,763 --> 00:36:17,763
because when you feel contractions and the bleeding starts it doesn't matter at that point.

489
00:36:18,764 --> 00:36:20,764
But until then, you must not budge.

490
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:24,766
Be ware of infections.

491
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,767
When I insert the probe, I sterilize it.

492
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:32,769
I have alcohol, all I need, but afterwards there is an infection hazard.

493
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,770
You know the blood is kind of favorising it.

494
00:36:35,771 --> 00:36:37,771
I'll give you some ampicilin to prevent it.

495
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:39,771
Have you ever taken ampicilin?

496
00:36:39,772 --> 00:36:41,772
- Yes

497
00:36:42,773 --> 00:36:44,773
- Is there any danger... or can the foetus not be expelled?

498
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:49,775
- Anything can happen, I told you, but usually it  is expelled.

499
00:36:55,778 --> 00:36:57,778
- Forgive me for asking, but what if, God forbids, she faints or gets fever

500
00:36:59,779 --> 00:37:01,779
or she loses blood, what do I do then?

501
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,780
Do I call an ambulance, do I call you?

502
00:37:06,782 --> 00:37:08,782
- If you call the ambulance, we're half way in prison, all of us.

503
00:37:12,784 --> 00:37:14,784
And be careful. If you call the ambulance, don't say you're not pregnant,

504
00:37:13,784 --> 00:37:15,784
cause they'll figure it out anyway

505
00:37:19,787 --> 00:37:21,787
Just say, I don't know, you saw something coming out but you couldn't tell what it was

506
00:37:21,787 --> 00:37:23,787
Nobody will believe you but it doesn't matter.

507
00:37:22,788 --> 00:37:24,788
At least thet'll be covered.

508
00:37:24,788 --> 00:37:26,788
It's best that we don't resort  to the ambulance.

509
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,790
How is your period?

510
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,791
Do you lose a lot of blood?

511
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:35,792
- Kind of yes.

512
00:37:36,793 --> 00:37:38,793
-Lay down so I can palpate you.

513
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,795
Unzip.

514
00:37:49,798 --> 00:37:51,798
Don't leave.

515
00:38:13,806 --> 00:38:15,806
Miss, what month did you say you were?

516
00:38:16,807 --> 00:38:18,807
- 3 month

517
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:23,809
- I'm going to ask you one more time and I want you to pay attention.

518
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,810
When was your last period?

519
00:38:29,812 --> 00:38:31,812
- December. It was due on 20.

520
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:34,813
- It was due on 20 but it didn't come?

521
00:38:34,814 --> 00:38:36,814
- No

522
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,815
- So the last time it came was... november.

523
00:38:41,816 --> 00:38:43,816
- Yea, I guess so.

524
00:38:45,818 --> 00:38:47,818
- Let's calculate. November, december, january, february

525
00:38:47,819 --> 00:38:49,819
How much is that?

526
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,820
But it last came in december.

527
00:38:56,822 --> 00:38:58,822
You have to calculate from november.

528
00:39:01,824 --> 00:39:03,824
It may be a little over 3 months.

529
00:39:04,825 --> 00:39:06,825
- A little? It's way over 3 months.

530
00:39:07,826 --> 00:39:09,826
Miss, I want you to gather yourself.

531
00:39:10,827 --> 00:39:12,827
What month are you?

532
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:18,829
Because there is a different set for 3 and a different set for 4 months

533
00:39:21,831 --> 00:39:23,831
- It could be the fourth.

534
00:39:23,832 --> 00:39:25,832
- The forth?

535
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:28,833
Or the fifth?

536
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:31,834
Miss, you better be careful with this things...

537
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:33,835
- It can't be the fifth.

538
00:39:33,835 --> 00:39:35,835
Most probably the fourth.

539
00:39:36,836 --> 00:39:38,836
I have an irregular period.

540
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:41,838
- You kind of playing with the months.

541
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,838
Could be fourth, could be fifth.

542
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,840
Do you realise that from 4 moths on it's not an abortion anymore,

543
00:39:49,841 --> 00:39:51,841
it's homicide.

544
00:39:51,842 --> 00:39:53,842
5 to 10 years of jail.

545
00:39:54,843 --> 00:39:56,843
Did you know that?

546
00:39:58,844 --> 00:40:00,844
You better not know it onwards.

547
00:40:02,846 --> 00:40:04,846
- I don't have a regular period.

548
00:40:05,847 --> 00:40:07,847
Sometimes it comes in 2 and a half months

549
00:40:06,847 --> 00:40:08,847
That's why I didn't bother.

550
00:40:07,848 --> 00:40:09,848
-Miss, please...

551
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:12,849
- You may not believe me...

552
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:13,849
-Well, I don't.

553
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:17,851
If you have an irregular period go to someone else, not me.

554
00:40:18,852 --> 00:40:20,852
That's how people are.

555
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,852
 They ignore the problem on, and on and on.

556
00:40:25,854 --> 00:40:27,854
And then come to me for help.

557
00:40:29,856 --> 00:40:31,856
You want someone else to pay for what you did?

558
00:40:31,856 --> 00:40:33,856
It's not me who had fun.

559
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:07,869
- Miss, I don't know...

560
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,870
 It's very dangerous.

561
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:15,872
Who do you think will perform an abortion in the fourth month?

562
00:41:15,872 --> 00:41:17,872
Or the fifth or whatever it may be.

563
00:41:18,874 --> 00:41:20,874
- Please, I beg you.

564
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:24,875
- You may beg, but...

565
00:41:26,876 --> 00:41:28,876
everything in this world has a price.

566
00:41:28,877 --> 00:41:30,877
- But we're paying you.

567
00:41:30,878 --> 00:41:32,878
- Really?

568
00:41:32,879 --> 00:41:34,879
- How much do yu have?

569
00:41:41,882 --> 00:41:43,882
- Look. We had to book the room for 3 days cause they wouldn't have given it otherwise

570
00:41:44,883 --> 00:41:46,883
- So?

571
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:50,884
- We manage to get 3000 in the first place,

572
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,886
but the room being so expensive, we ended with 2850.

573
00:38:19,808 --> 00:38:21,808
Is there a problem?

574
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,887
- Miss did I mention anything about the money?

575
00:41:59,888 --> 00:42:01,888
Did I mention about the money on the phone?

576
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,870
- Well, is just that you didn't say, so we asked Ramona

577
00:42:10,892 --> 00:42:12,892
how much it would be and we asked oyher people as well

578
00:42:13,894 --> 00:42:15,894
and that's what everybody told us. It's at most 3000.

579
00:42:17,895 --> 00:42:19,895
-Ramona told you it's 3000?

580
00:42:21,896 --> 00:42:23,896
-She said that what she knew.

581
00:42:27,899 --> 00:42:29,899
-Then let Ramona perform it, if that's what she knows.

582
00:42:34,901 --> 00:42:36,901
- Miss, do you remember what we talked on the phone?

583
00:42:40,903 --> 00:42:42,903
I said I was sympathetic and if you want, I can help.

584
00:42:43,904 --> 00:42:45,904
Ay or nay?

585
00:42:44,905 --> 00:42:46,905
Did I say anything about the money?

586
00:42:48,906 --> 00:42:50,906
- You said we'll get along somehow.

587
00:42:52,908 --> 00:42:54,908
- Of course, that's why I asked you to come personally at the meeting

588
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:56,908
So we can agree on every aspect from the very begining.

589
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,910
Look now. I'm not being judgemental for what happened to you

590
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:03,911
Every one makes mistakes in life.

591
00:43:06,913 --> 00:43:08,913
I didn't ask for your name, nor where is the father of the baby, nothing of that

592
00:43:07,913 --> 00:43:09,913
It's not my bussiness.

593
00:43:10,914 --> 00:43:12,914
I said I can help you and as you can see I have nothing to hide.

594
00:43:13,915 --> 00:43:15,915
I came with my own car, my ID is at the counter

595
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:19,917
If Militia shows up, I'm the first they bust.

596
00:43:20,918 --> 00:43:22,918
So I'm risking my freedom....

597
00:43:23,919 --> 00:43:25,919
You should know I have children too

598
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,920
I'm being nice to you and I help you

599
00:43:30,922 --> 00:43:32,922
So you should be nice to me as well

600
00:43:33,923 --> 00:43:35,923
That's how I see things.

601
00:43:38,925 --> 00:43:40,925
- Hold it a bit cause I don't think I follow you

602
00:43:40,925 --> 00:43:42,925
- I'm not going anywhere.

603
00:43:42,926 --> 00:43:44,926
I think you're the one hurrying.

604
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:48,927
What the part you didn't understand?

605
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:52,929
I was very clear and I don't like to repeat myself.

606
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,930
What did you think?

607
00:43:59,932 --> 00:44:01,932
That I risk 10 years of jail for 3000?

608
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:05,934
That what you thought?

609
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,935
What do you think I am, a street beggar?

610
00:44:11,937 --> 00:44:13,937
Did you see me searching in the dumpster?

611
00:44:16,938 --> 00:44:18,938
Look now,

612
00:44:18,939 --> 00:44:20,939
while I go to the bathroom, you'll do some thinking

613
00:44:19,939 --> 00:44:21,939
and when I come out you'll tell what you decided.

614
00:44:22,941 --> 00:44:24,941
If you want to go along, then you tell me whose the first one

615
00:44:24,941 --> 00:44:26,941
If not I get my things and I leave

616
00:44:27,942 --> 00:44:29,942
- You're the one who asked for my help, not me.

617
00:44:32,944 --> 00:44:34,944
- God, I'm sick

618
00:44:34,945 --> 00:44:36,945
I can't believe what's going on.

619
00:44:38,946 --> 00:44:40,946
- Why did you have to tell him you're in the second month?

620
00:44:41,947 --> 00:44:43,947
- That's what Ramona told me.

621
00:44:42,948 --> 00:44:44,948
Otherwise he might not want to.

622
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:46,949
- So that's how he want to.

623
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:49,950
- Why the hell did you have to wait for so long?

624
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:50,950
- What am I to do now?

625
00:44:51,951 --> 00:44:53,951
And we paid for the room too.

626
00:44:53,952 --> 00:44:55,952
- The room is your major worry, now?

627
00:44:58,954 --> 00:45:00,954
Damn Gabi, you really annoy me sometimes.

628
00:44:59,954 --> 00:45:01,954
I told you many times to be careful. But not you. You know better.

629
00:45:00,954 --> 00:45:02,954
- I don't know what to do.

630
00:45:04,956 --> 00:45:06,956
Don't worry, you don't have to be involved in this.

631
00:45:07,957 --> 00:45:09,957
There is one thing to help me, and come with me and totally different to...

632
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,958
Give me the money.

633
00:45:25,963 --> 00:45:27,963
- You tell us how much. Is 4000 ok?

634
00:45:28,965 --> 00:45:30,965
4500, 5000, how much?

635
00:45:30,965 --> 00:45:32,965
- Do you have that kind of money?

636
00:45:33,966 --> 00:45:35,966
- Why are we talking then, just for fun?

637
00:45:34,967 --> 00:45:36,967
- We can make it.

638
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:37,967
- You can make it.

639
00:45:38,968 --> 00:45:40,968
- You tell me what a burden the room was

640
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:43,969
and then you say you can come up with an aditional 2-3000

641
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,970
Come on lady.

642
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,970
How can you make it?

643
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,970
- We'll borrow.

644
00:45:45,971 --> 00:45:47,971
- Really?

645
00:45:46,971 --> 00:45:48,971
And how do you give it back?

646
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:49,971
- That's our bussiness.

647
00:45:49,972 --> 00:45:51,972
- So, now you're getting tough on me.

648
00:45:50,973 --> 00:45:52,973
- I didn't say that, I was explaining...

649
00:45:51,973 --> 00:45:53,973
- And how much time will it take to get the money?

650
00:45:54,974 --> 00:45:56,974
- At the most next Saturday.

651
00:45:55,974 --> 00:45:57,974
I'll have it all.

652
00:45:58,975 --> 00:46:00,975
- Until next Saturday you'll have all the money?

653
00:46:02,977 --> 00:46:04,977
- Ok then, if you say so.

654
00:46:09,979 --> 00:46:11,979
You call me when you have all the money and we'll see then.

655
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,980
- No, please don't go.

656
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:14,981
I beg you to do it today.

657
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:16,981
The room is paid and all...

658
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:17,982
- How to do it? Is it you that is doing it?

659
00:46:18,983 --> 00:46:20,983
- -No..., please forgive me

660
00:46:19,983 --> 00:46:21,983
I meant you do it.

661
00:46:21,984 --> 00:46:23,984
- So, how do we do it?

662
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,986
- Here's 2800 we got so far and I promise you I'll have another 2000 by Tuesday.

663
00:46:30,987 --> 00:46:32,987
Will this do?

664
00:46:32,988 --> 00:46:34,988
You must trust us, we won't...

665
00:46:35,989 --> 00:46:37,989
- Trust? What trust? Do I know you? Do I know who you are?

666
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,990
You can take the train tomorrow and leave town. How do I know?

667
00:46:42,991 --> 00:46:44,991
- We wouldn't do something like that.

668
00:46:45,993 --> 00:46:47,993
I'll give you my ID

669
00:46:49,994 --> 00:46:51,994
- What am I to do with it? Look for you in the middle of nowhere?

670
00:46:52,995 --> 00:46:54,995
- We're students here, where could we go?

671
00:46:53,995 --> 00:46:55,995
Look, I'm going to phone home and get the money til Monday

672
00:46:55,996 --> 00:46:57,996
- Girl, are you bullshiting me?

673
00:46:56,997 --> 00:46:58,997
I am asking you once more: are you bullshiting me?

674
00:46:59,998 --> 00:47:01,998
- I'm not bullshiting you, but...

675
00:47:00,998 --> 00:47:02,998
- But what?

676
00:47:04,999 --> 00:47:06,999
- I've explained it plain and clear. Don't make me repeat myself cause I don't like it.

677
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
- Believe me, if I had that money I would have gone home and get it for you.

678
00:48:07,022 --> 00:48:09,022
But we don't have it. I gave you my word that next Saturday...

679
00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:12,001
- Girl, what the fuck do you think?

680
00:47:12,002 --> 00:47:14,002
You think you can fool me like a fucking idiot?

681
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:18,003
I have scums like you for breakfast.

682
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:21,005
Smarter assholes tried to fuck me and they couldn't do it.

683
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,005
Do you think you can fool me?

684
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,006
Like you're some smartasses and I'm a stupid fuck?

685
00:47:25,007 --> 00:47:27,007
Fuck you and all this!

686
00:47:29,008 --> 00:47:31,008
- Please, please, you have to help me.

687
00:47:31,009 --> 00:47:33,009
It doesn't concern her. It's about me.

688
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:36,010
And please let's do it today.

689
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:37,010
Like you said.

690
00:47:36,011 --> 00:47:38,011
- What do you mean, I said so?

691
00:47:39,012 --> 00:47:41,012
- If you make mistakes, you pay.

692
00:47:45,014 --> 00:47:47,014
It's my fault. She has nothing to do with it.

693
00:47:46,014 --> 00:47:48,014
- I didn't require that, do you understand?

694
00:47:48,015 --> 00:47:50,015
- I understood very well.

695
00:47:53,017 --> 00:47:55,017
She's not my sister, I'm sorry I lied to on the phone.

696
00:47:56,018 --> 00:47:58,018
She's just my room mate.

697
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:02,019
- So what? Did I ask you whose sister is she? I don't think so.

698
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,020
I've explained it to you very clear

699
00:48:07,022 --> 00:48:09,022
- Yes. That's the best I can do. What I can do?

700
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:12,023
My room mate has no obligation

701
00:48:14,025 --> 00:48:16,025
- That's why I was suggesting...

702
00:48:16,025 --> 00:48:18,025
- You don't suggest anything to me , clear?

703
00:48:18,026 --> 00:48:20,026
You come to me and ask me something.

704
00:48:21,027 --> 00:48:23,027
And I told you I can help and I told you the conditions

705
00:48:23,028 --> 00:48:25,028
If you don't understand, its ok, nobofy is forcing you.

706
00:48:24,028 --> 00:48:26,028
- I'm having my period.

707
00:48:25,029 --> 00:48:27,029
- What did you say?

708
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:31,030
Please repeat. You said it low and I couldn't hear.

709
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,030
- She's having her period.

710
00:48:33,031 --> 00:48:35,031
- I'm out of here. I had enough of this.

711
00:48:36,033 --> 00:48:38,033
-Please, please don't leave.

712
00:48:40,034 --> 00:48:42,034
- Ok, ok. Put the damn probe and...

713
00:48:41,034 --> 00:48:43,034
- And?

714
00:48:45,036 --> 00:48:47,036
So how am I to put the probe?

715
00:48:48,037 --> 00:48:50,037
Do you think I was born yesterday?

716
00:49:40,056 --> 00:49:42,056
- Excuse me...

717
00:49:44,057 --> 00:49:46,057
Do you have a cigarette?

718
00:49:57,062 --> 00:49:59,062
Thank you.

719
00:54:50,169 --> 00:54:52,169
-Lye down.

720
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:47,210
- Are you making a shot?

721
00:56:46,211 --> 00:56:48,211
-No

722
00:56:53,213 --> 00:56:55,213
- What is it?

723
00:56:54,214 --> 00:56:56,214
- Water.

724
00:57:09,219 --> 00:57:11,219
- If nothing happens till tomorrow, you can add some yourself.

725
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,220
- Give me the probe.

726
00:57:31,227 --> 00:57:33,227
- Don"t be tensed.

727
00:57:48,233 --> 00:57:50,233
- When you feel something stinging let me know.

728
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:54,235
- Did it sting?

729
00:57:53,235 --> 00:57:55,235
- Yes.

730
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,240
- When you feel it comes out, you go and sit on the closet.

731
00:58:08,241 --> 00:58:10,241
Cause it comes out easier.

732
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:14,242
Give me the bandage.

733
00:58:21,245 --> 00:58:23,245
Hold this.

734
00:58:41,253 --> 00:58:43,253
Important. Don't cut the cord until the placenta is out.

735
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:45,253
If it remains inside, it's bad.

736
00:58:46,255 --> 00:58:48,255
You just stay still until it comes out, ok?

737
00:58:49,256 --> 00:58:51,256
Sit still!

738
00:58:52,257 --> 00:58:54,257
- Can I cover myself?

739
00:58:53,257 --> 00:58:55,257
- Yes.

740
00:59:06,262 --> 00:59:08,262
- I forgot to tell you something important.

741
00:59:11,264 --> 00:59:13,264
Don't throw the aborted fetus in the closet, cause it will jam. Ok?

742
00:59:14,265 --> 00:59:16,265
Not by pieces not as a whole.Don't get any ideas.

743
00:59:19,267 --> 00:59:21,267
And don't bury it so that the dogs will find it and all

744
00:59:24,268 --> 00:59:26,268
You wrap in a cloth, you go whatever neighborhood you chose

745
00:59:26,269 --> 00:59:28,269
You get in the first apartment building you see

746
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:30,270
and you throw it in the dumpster from the 10th floor. Got it?

747
00:59:31,271 --> 00:59:33,271
- Yes

748
00:59:35,272 --> 00:59:37,272
- Check her temperature in the morning and in the evening.

749
00:59:38,273 --> 00:59:40,273
If it's 37-38, it's ok

750
00:59:44,276 --> 00:59:46,276
If it goes beyond 39 you gave her aspirin and these.

751
00:59:54,279 --> 00:59:56,279
If you want I can come and see you tomorrow at 2, or tonight after 8

752
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,280
- No, you don't have to...

753
00:59:58,281 --> 01:00:00,281
- Come on, don't...

754
01:00:01,282 --> 01:00:03,282
As you wish.

755
01:00:07,284 --> 01:00:09,284
If you're ill or you need me, then call me.

756
01:00:11,285 --> 01:00:13,285
Don't move, ok?

757
01:00:13,286 --> 01:00:15,286
Questions?

758
01:00:17,288 --> 01:00:19,288
Ok, I'll be on my way.

759
01:00:19,288 --> 01:00:21,288
Good luck.

760
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:41,077
- Listen

761
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:23,333
- Thanks.

762
01:02:44,341 --> 01:02:46,341
- I'm  curious to know...

763
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,343
How come Ramona recommended this guy to you?

764
01:02:56,345 --> 01:02:58,345
- Luciana had an interruption with him recently.

765
01:02:59,347 --> 01:03:01,347
- So it's not her that had the interruption?

766
01:01:00,303 --> 01:01:02,303
- No.

767
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:07,349
- Then why did she recommend him?

768
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:11,350
What if it's an asshole?

769
01:03:16,353 --> 01:03:18,353
She thought she was making you a favour, right?

770
01:03:23,355 --> 01:03:25,355
- She said this guy will do it even if the pregnancy is over 3 months.

771
01:03:29,357 --> 01:03:31,357
- Then why did you tell this jerk it's 2 months?

772
01:03:34,359 --> 01:03:36,359
- I thought it was better this way.

773
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,360
- Really? Well, stop thinking.

774
01:03:42,362 --> 01:03:44,362
And if you are going to lie, at least tell me about it.

775
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:58,367
Why the fuck did you tell him I'm your sister?

776
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:02,369
How did it cross your mind?

777
01:04:07,371 --> 01:04:09,371
- He told me I should come and you went instead of me

778
01:04:08,372 --> 01:04:10,372
what could have I said?

779
01:04:11,373 --> 01:04:13,373
- Then why didn't you go?

780
01:04:15,374 --> 01:04:17,374
- I've asked you to go, haven't I?

781
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:20,375
- Gabitza, are you following me?

782
01:04:21,376 --> 01:04:23,376
Why didn't you go?

783
01:04:26,378 --> 01:04:28,378
- Because I was reluctant, that's why.

784
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:33,380
- So you lied your sister would come.

785
01:04:36,382 --> 01:04:38,382
- I didn't lie to you.

786
01:04:39,383 --> 01:04:41,383
- It doesn't matter who you lied to.

787
01:04:42,384 --> 01:04:44,384
- I just forgot to tell you, but I didn't lied to you.

788
01:04:48,386 --> 01:04:50,386
- It doesn't matter anymore.

789
01:04:57,389 --> 01:04:59,389
- I'm just upset that because of some stupid mistakes you've made

790
01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:00,390
things had to happen this way.

791
01:05:07,393 --> 01:05:09,393
We could have gone to Miss Jeni, the one Dorina told you about.

792
01:05:09,394 --> 01:05:11,394
And things would have been allright.

793
01:05:15,396 --> 01:05:17,396
-  Sure, now it's easy to say that.

794
01:05:21,398 --> 01:05:23,398
It was your opinion it doesn't matter it's a man as long as it's cheap.

795
01:05:22,399 --> 01:05:24,399
- Did I say that?

796
01:05:28,401 --> 01:05:30,401
I said to do it where it's cheaper, of course,

797
01:05:31,402 --> 01:05:33,402
but not that it doesn't matter if it's a man or not.

798
01:05:36,404 --> 01:05:38,404
I didn't even think that....

799
01:05:39,405 --> 01:05:41,405
- Do you think I did?

800
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:46,407
- God damn it.

801
01:05:48,408 --> 01:05:50,408
If that that bitch from the hotel had kept my resevation

802
01:05:49,408 --> 01:05:51,408
maybe none of this would have happened.

803
01:06:01,413 --> 01:06:03,413
- What were you thinking, making the reservation over the phone?

804
01:06:07,415 --> 01:06:09,415
- I told her I was from another town.

805
01:06:11,416 --> 01:06:13,416
- Did you?....

806
01:06:18,419 --> 01:06:20,419
 Whatever.

807
01:06:24,421 --> 01:06:26,421
- Are there any cigarettes left?

808
01:06:25,422 --> 01:06:27,422
- No.

809
01:06:38,426 --> 01:06:40,426
- This still nature painting sucks.

810
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:58,433
- Comfortable?

811
01:06:59,434 --> 01:07:01,434
- Yes.

812
01:07:03,435 --> 01:07:05,435
- Does that thing hurt?

813
01:07:06,436 --> 01:07:08,436
- Stings a bit.

814
01:07:07,437 --> 01:07:09,437
It hurt when he put it.

815
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,440
- I have to go to Adi's.

816
01:07:18,441 --> 01:07:20,441
It's his mother's birthday and I promised I would go.

817
01:07:32,446 --> 01:07:34,446
Should I turn on the lamp?

818
01:07:37,448 --> 01:07:39,448
- No, leave it like this.

819
01:07:48,452 --> 01:07:50,452
-I'd like a glass of water here.

820
01:08:09,459 --> 01:08:11,459
- I'll be away for an hour.

821
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:13,460
- Do you want me to bring you something to eat?

822
01:08:13,461 --> 01:08:15,461
- I'm not hungry.

823
01:08:15,462 --> 01:08:17,462
- You'll be later.

824
01:08:17,462 --> 01:08:19,462
- No. I have the cookies.

825
01:08:19,463 --> 01:08:21,463
- I couldbring some beef salad from Adi.

826
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:23,464
- No, I won't eat.

827
01:08:24,465 --> 01:08:26,465
- Ok, I'll see what I'll do.

828
01:08:29,467 --> 01:08:31,467
- Look, I'll leave the number here.

829
01:08:32,468 --> 01:08:34,468
If you need something, call me.

830
01:08:35,469 --> 01:08:37,469
- Don't leave it, I won't call you there.

831
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:40,470
- I'll call you anyway but it's better that you have it too.

832
01:08:43,472 --> 01:08:45,472
- I'm leaving. Be careful, don't let anyone in.

833
01:08:49,474 --> 01:08:51,474
- Are you leaving or what?

834
01:08:58,477 --> 01:09:00,477
- What about the key?

835
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:04,479
I'll lock you in and take the key.

836
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,480
Don't worry, you'll be allright.

837
01:09:08,481 --> 01:09:10,481
- Bye.

838
01:09:17,484 --> 01:09:19,484
-Miss. Miss.

839
01:09:22,486 --> 01:09:24,486
- The person who visited you forgot his ID.

840
01:10:49,518 --> 01:10:51,518
- Don't tell me that you forgot the flowers on top of being late.

841
01:10:52,519 --> 01:10:54,519
- If you talk to me like this, I'm leaving.

842
01:10:54,519 --> 01:10:56,519
- You're late and angry?

843
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,520
- Good evening. I'm Alin's mother.

844
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:01,521
- Otilia. Happy birthday.

845
01:11:01,522 --> 01:11:03,522
- Thank you dear. I'm so glad you came.

846
01:11:06,524 --> 01:11:08,524
- Are those pickles coming?

847
01:11:09,525 --> 01:11:11,525
- Go, go inside. I have to get some pickles.

848
01:11:13,526 --> 01:11:15,526
- I have to make a phone call.

849
01:11:31,533 --> 01:11:33,533
- Good evening. 206, please.

850
01:11:43,537 --> 01:11:45,537
- Otilia, my dad.

851
01:11:45,538 --> 01:11:47,538
- Dad? That's how you introduce me?

852
01:11:46,538 --> 01:11:48,538
- Otilia. - Nice to meet you

853
01:11:47,539 --> 01:11:49,539
- Happy Birthday. -Come in.

854
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,540
- You don't have to.

855
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:55,541
Ady, give her your slipers.

856
01:11:56,542 --> 01:11:58,542
Put them on or you'll catch a cold.

857
01:11:58,543 --> 01:12:00,543
- You take mine and take the shoes.

858
01:11:59,543 --> 01:12:01,543
- But I don't want to.

859
01:12:01,544 --> 01:12:03,544
- Come in, don't be shy.

860
01:12:03,544 --> 01:12:05,544
- Good evening.

861
01:12:05,545 --> 01:12:07,545
- She is Ady's girlfriend,

862
01:12:07,546 --> 01:12:09,546
Otilia.

863
01:12:09,547 --> 01:12:11,547
- They are the Rusu, Ady's godfathers'.

864
01:12:12,548 --> 01:12:14,548
She is doctor Aldea, doctor Racoviceanu, cardiologist, his wife

865
01:12:16,549 --> 01:12:18,549
- Let her sit down, she's dizzy with so many new people.

866
01:12:20,551 --> 01:12:22,551
- He went to cardiology but his problem resided in the upper story. -ha, ha

867
01:12:24,552 --> 01:12:26,552
- We'll see who's the doctor when the prostate gets nasty.

868
01:12:32,555 --> 01:12:34,555
- Where is the toilet?

869
01:12:34,556 --> 01:12:36,556
- Excuse me.

870
01:12:40,558 --> 01:12:42,558
- The toilet? - Down the hall. Turn on the light.

871
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:45,559
- I won't be able to stay much longer.

872
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,560
- What are you saying. You've just arrived.

873
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:42,580
- Did you wash your hands?

874
01:13:44,581 --> 01:13:46,581
- You said it was just passing by and saying Happy birthday

875
01:13:45,582 --> 01:13:47,582
not having dinner with your folks.

876
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:50,583
- We wait till they pop off the champagne and then we go to my room.

877
01:13:57,586 --> 01:13:59,586
-Let me go, I'm all sweaty

878
01:13:59,587 --> 01:14:01,587
- Here comes the soup.

879
01:14:02,588 --> 01:14:04,588
- Please, go ahead.

880
01:14:06,589 --> 01:14:08,589
- Come on, come on.

881
01:14:13,592 --> 01:14:15,592
- Whenever you see eachother you start all over again.

882
01:14:14,592 --> 01:14:16,592
- So, what's the problem?

883
01:14:15,593 --> 01:14:17,593
- What would you like to drink?

884
01:14:16,593 --> 01:14:18,593
- Some juice please.

885
01:14:18,594 --> 01:14:20,594
- Very good, those meat balls.

886
01:14:20,594 --> 01:14:22,594
- They're with frozen meat.

887
01:14:22,595 --> 01:14:24,595
- It's not that I don't drink, but I don't feel like now.

888
01:14:23,595 --> 01:14:25,595
- It's very good that she is not drinking.

889
01:14:25,596 --> 01:14:27,596
- Not even vermouth?

890
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:31,598
- I don't mind, but not now, really.

891
01:14:30,598 --> 01:14:32,598
-Maybe the girl is fasting.

892
01:14:31,598 --> 01:14:33,598
- So what if she's fasting?

893
01:14:32,599 --> 01:14:34,599
- I'm not fasting.

894
01:14:34,599 --> 01:14:36,599
- I've heard you're from Galati county.

895
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,600
- Galati city, actually

896
01:14:37,601 --> 01:14:39,601
- Galati city, you say.

897
01:14:39,601 --> 01:14:41,601
- Do you happen to know Dr Ivanov, the surgeon?

898
01:14:43,603 --> 01:14:45,603
He's very professional.

899
01:14:42,602 --> 01:14:44,602
- Not really. After highschool I left the to go to university.

900
01:14:44,603 --> 01:14:46,603
- He was my student.

901
01:14:46,604 --> 01:14:48,604
- Straight A student.

902
01:14:48,605 --> 01:14:50,605
- Yes, 9,80  9,70

903
01:14:51,606 --> 01:14:53,606
- And it was hard back then. If you grabbed a 7 in Anatomy you were celebrating all day.

904
01:14:54,607 --> 01:14:56,607
Now they churn out '10' on the conveyor belt.

905
01:14:58,608 --> 01:15:00,608
- Even 10,50. I know a student straight '10' till the sixth year.

906
01:15:00,609 --> 01:15:02,609
The Party gave him another 0,50

907
01:15:02,610 --> 01:15:04,610
And now he's 10,50. How about that?

908
01:15:04,610 --> 01:15:06,610
- Don't forget 0,25 if you start a family.

909
01:15:05,611 --> 01:15:07,611
- Yes, that too.

910
01:15:06,611 --> 01:15:08,611
- Maybe your son will take that 0,25 next year

911
01:15:07,611 --> 01:15:09,611
- Look, he blushed, ha ha.

912
01:15:10,613 --> 01:15:12,613
- Oh, leave my boy alone.

913
01:15:11,613 --> 01:15:13,613
- It's time...

914
01:15:13,614 --> 01:15:15,614
- Are your parents teaching, too?

915
01:15:17,615 --> 01:15:19,615
- No, my father is in the military and my mother is retired, she's sick.

916
01:15:19,616 --> 01:15:21,616
She was working when she was younger, but now...

917
01:15:26,618 --> 01:15:28,618
-Sometimes, simple folks are better raised than a lot of people with high education.

918
01:15:28,619 --> 01:15:30,619
- Not really. It depends much on the environment.

919
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,620
Take this Dima for instance. He's from the country side. The Party

920
01:15:34,621 --> 01:15:36,621
promoted him on account of his 'worker origins' and now he's a big shot.

921
01:15:36,622 --> 01:15:38,622
- Forget that. Let's have a toast better.

922
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,623
- Happy birthday, happy birthday.

923
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:47,625
- Turn the volume a little higher, I want to hear what The All-Too-Knowing is up to.

924
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:48,626
- Is this pork?

925
01:15:50,627 --> 01:15:52,627
- It's very hard to cook in this house

926
01:15:52,628 --> 01:15:54,628
Ever since Ady was a little boy, he didn't eat pork

927
01:15:54,629 --> 01:15:56,629
Whenever he saw a bit of fat on his dish, he refused to eat

928
01:15:55,629 --> 01:15:57,629
no matter how insignificant that piece of fat was

929
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:01,630
- Our Valentin would do the same.

930
01:16:01,631 --> 01:16:03,631
- In the soup too. The same refusal.

931
01:16:10,634 --> 01:16:12,634
Even his school lunchbox. If I put chicken in he would give it to his friends.

932
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:16,636
And I couldn't stand that. Because we weren't so well put back then.

933
01:16:17,637 --> 01:16:19,637
I had to stay up to 3 hours in a line for a pound of meat.

934
01:16:20,638 --> 01:16:22,638
And he was picky.

935
01:16:22,639 --> 01:16:24,639
- It's better the children be acustomed to hardships since they are little

936
01:16:24,639 --> 01:16:26,639
cause no one is going to grant them any favours later in life.

937
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:27,640
-That's true

938
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,640
- They sent me to take care of the cattle when I was a little boy

939
01:16:28,641 --> 01:16:30,641
and I did my homeworks at the light of a gaslamp.

940
01:16:31,642 --> 01:16:33,642
And we were 9 brothers

941
01:16:34,643 --> 01:16:36,643
My mother was putting the 'mamaliga' (polenta) on the table

942
01:16:35,643 --> 01:16:37,643
and some were lucky to snatch a piece, and some weren't.

943
01:16:36,644 --> 01:16:38,644
-But you managed to snatch.

944
01:16:41,646 --> 01:16:43,646
- Not here. My husband is very picky.

945
01:16:46,647 --> 01:16:48,647
- If I didn't prepare the mash potatoes the way his mother did, he wouldn't eat.

946
01:16:50,649 --> 01:16:52,649
- And still, it's not as good as my mother's.

947
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:55,650
- But it's good. - Ok,ok it's good allright.

948
01:16:59,652 --> 01:17:01,652
- Nowadays, people are too spoiled.

949
01:17:00,653 --> 01:17:02,653
- My grandmother used to add some milk.

950
01:17:03,654 --> 01:17:05,654
- Me too.

951
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:08,655
- And some water in wich to boil the potatoes.

952
01:17:07,655 --> 01:17:09,655
- It depends on how you're used to.

953
01:17:10,656 --> 01:17:12,656
- We didn't have any butter. But my mother used to put potatoes in the 'mamaliga'

954
01:17:11,657 --> 01:17:13,657
It was awesome.

955
01:17:16,658 --> 01:17:18,658
- We ourselves, we had differences with our parents when we were young.

956
01:17:19,659 --> 01:17:21,659
- Stop taking their side. They take everything for granted.

957
01:17:24,661 --> 01:17:26,661
Look at them. Hostel, scholarship, mom and dad feed them. Man...

958
01:17:26,662 --> 01:17:28,662
- It's not quite like that

959
01:17:28,663 --> 01:17:30,663
Think about the allotment of jobs in medicine

960
01:17:31,664 --> 01:17:33,664
If they end up in some far away hamlet, they're through.

961
01:17:33,665 --> 01:17:35,665
- What's the problem with the allotment?

962
01:17:37,666 --> 01:17:39,666
I myself had to work 8 years in Cotnari

963
01:17:39,667 --> 01:17:41,667
And I was fine.

964
01:17:42,668 --> 01:17:44,668
- Please, have some more

965
01:17:44,669 --> 01:17:46,669
Don't wait for me to serve.

966
01:17:46,669 --> 01:17:48,669
Doctor, what would you like?

967
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:51,670
- If girls aren't smart enough to mary during faculty years

968
01:17:51,671 --> 01:17:53,671
they end up in the countryside and marry eather the teacher or the priest

969
01:17:55,673 --> 01:17:57,673
And the priest is usually the biggest drunk in the village.

970
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,674
- Come on. Thre are serious priests as well.

971
01:18:00,674 --> 01:18:02,674
- Those are exceptions.

972
01:18:04,676 --> 01:18:06,676
- Most of them have colour TV, VCR, and if you're looking for them they are busy.

973
01:18:06,677 --> 01:18:08,677
- What are they busy with?

974
01:18:08,677 --> 01:18:10,677
- Busy with confessions.

975
01:18:14,679 --> 01:18:16,679
- We're going to the church on Easter.

976
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,680
They can arrest me if they like. I don't care.

977
01:18:17,681 --> 01:18:19,681
- Who's going to arrest you?

978
01:18:18,681 --> 01:18:20,681
- The priest, ha ha ha

979
01:18:29,685 --> 01:18:31,685
- Don't laugh. Guess what colleague I bump into on Easter at the church.

980
01:18:34,687 --> 01:18:36,687
He was sneaking behind a column. ...Hutonas

981
01:18:37,688 --> 01:18:39,688
- Aurel went straight to him and ask him 'where is your notebook?'

982
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:44,690
- No, it wasn't like that. I told him 'why don't you take that notebook out and write clearly?'

983
01:18:45,691 --> 01:18:47,691
He played it down,  'come on Aurel, don't say that' and things like that

984
01:18:47,691 --> 01:18:49,691
- You did the right thing.

985
01:18:50,693 --> 01:18:52,693
- You know, my sister in law gave last Easter egg paint from Germany.

986
01:18:55,694 --> 01:18:57,694
And some marzipan. It was a delight.

987
01:18:55,694 --> 01:18:57,694
- Last year all my eggs cracked during boiling. I can't imagine what happened.

988
01:18:58,695 --> 01:19:00,695
- Mine were just fine

989
01:19:00,696 --> 01:19:02,696
- If you use good paint I'm sure they were fine

990
01:19:02,697 --> 01:19:04,697
- I use a bit of oil. Makes them shine.

991
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:05,697
- I use butter.

992
01:19:05,698 --> 01:19:07,698
- I don't have to smear anyting. This german paint does the trick.

993
01:19:08,699 --> 01:19:10,699
I had yellow and green paint. And orange.

994
01:19:09,699 --> 01:19:11,699
And blue.

995
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:13,700
- No, I got blue from yellow and green.

996
01:19:14,701 --> 01:19:16,701
- After we use the paint, we share the rest of the paint with neighbours.

997
01:19:17,702 --> 01:19:19,702
-That's a good did.

998
01:19:20,703 --> 01:19:22,703
- Would you like a cigarette?

999
01:19:22,704 --> 01:19:24,704
Come on, have one.

1000
01:19:24,705 --> 01:19:26,705
- Thank you.

1001
01:19:25,705 --> 01:19:27,705
- Where are you studying?

1002
01:19:26,706 --> 01:19:28,706
- Polytechnics.

1003
01:19:29,707 --> 01:19:31,707
- When I was young, girls went to medicine and boys to polytechnic.

1004
01:19:30,707 --> 01:19:32,707
- The same thing today.

1005
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:34,708
- The main adavantage at polytechnics is you don't get stuck in a village.

1006
01:19:35,709 --> 01:19:37,709
- It's not easy to spend a lifetime in a factory, either.

1007
01:19:36,709 --> 01:19:38,709
- You stay at the hostel?

1008
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:39,710
- Yes.

1009
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:41,710
- How many in the room?

1010
01:19:43,712 --> 01:19:45,712
- Usually 4, But I pulled some strings and I moved together with a friend of mine.

1011
01:19:44,712 --> 01:19:46,712
- Resourceful girl.

1012
01:19:48,714 --> 01:19:50,714
- Miss, excuse me, but I...,

1013
01:19:51,715 --> 01:19:53,715
well, it's not proper for a young lady to smoke in the presence of the boy's parents

1014
01:19:53,715 --> 01:19:55,715
- Emilian! - Don't interrupt me.

1015
01:19:57,717 --> 01:19:59,717
I was 43 when my father passed away but I've never smoked when he was around

1016
01:19:59,718 --> 01:20:01,718
Never.

1017
01:20:00,718 --> 01:20:02,718
- That's very healthy

1018
01:20:01,718 --> 01:20:03,718
- As if yor father didn't know you were smoking.

1019
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:05,719
- Get the champagne from the refrigerator.

1020
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:07,720
- Of course he knew. But it's about respect.

1021
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,721
The children are now openly defiant.

1022
01:20:10,722 --> 01:20:12,722
- Even my Valentin...

1023
01:20:11,722 --> 01:20:13,722
- Who's defying you?

1024
01:20:12,722 --> 01:20:14,722
- Well, it may not be the right word but....

1025
01:20:13,723 --> 01:20:15,723
you know what I mean

1026
01:20:16,724 --> 01:20:18,724
- I, for one, didn't aprove of my son not serving in the army.

1027
01:20:19,725 --> 01:20:21,725
Why shouldn't he ? He has to, he's got to learn what life is all about.

1028
01:20:22,726 --> 01:20:24,726
Not smothered, because sooner or later he's got to find out what a real man is..

1029
01:20:23,726 --> 01:20:25,726
- That's right, our son behaves the same way...

1030
01:20:24,727 --> 01:20:26,727
- I don't agree...

1031
01:20:27,728 --> 01:20:29,728
What? You think that if you spend nine months there and they brutify you

1032
01:20:30,729 --> 01:20:32,729
you'll come out a man?

1033
01:20:31,729 --> 01:20:33,729
-That's right.

1034
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:34,730
- I wouldn't tolerate for my son to suffer like that.

1035
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:36,730
What for?

1036
01:20:36,731 --> 01:20:38,731
-You should see the ones that serve sixteen months! Poor guys...

1037
01:20:39,732 --> 01:20:41,732
-It also depends where you're serving.

1038
01:20:40,733 --> 01:20:42,733
-Boarder police is the worst.

1039
01:20:41,733 --> 01:20:43,733
- But it's satisfactory.

1040
01:20:42,733 --> 01:20:44,733
- No, no...the disciplinary batallion is the hardest.

1041
01:20:44,734 --> 01:20:46,734
- Yes, but that' not what we were talking about!

1042
01:20:45,734 --> 01:20:47,734
- No, listen here...

1043
01:20:46,735 --> 01:20:48,735
- We didnt't exempt Adi because his father didn't want to.

1044
01:20:48,735 --> 01:20:50,735
No, God forbid, his father has principles.

1045
01:20:49,736 --> 01:20:51,736
That's why the boy is studying chemistry now.

1046
01:20:51,737 --> 01:20:53,737
- Chemistry is good, dear. You'll see, I'll take him in as my assistant

1047
01:20:54,738 --> 01:20:56,738
and you'll see he'll grow to like it.

1048
01:20:57,739 --> 01:20:59,739
- We'll keep him at home to learn for an year and he'll have another go.

1049
01:20:59,739 --> 01:21:01,739
-The army, only the army is the real school of life.

1050
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:03,740
- Allright, where's that champagne? Let's pop the cork!

1051
01:21:10,743 --> 01:21:12,743
- Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you

1052
01:21:16,746 --> 01:21:18,746
- Congratulations, dear!

1053
01:21:25,749 --> 01:21:27,749
- Happy birthday! Cheers!

1054
01:21:37,753 --> 01:21:39,753
- Could you please get me the phone?

1055
01:21:38,754 --> 01:21:40,754
- Ya, sure.

1056
01:21:47,757 --> 01:21:49,757
- Adela is on the phone.

1057
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,760
-  Now, are you going to tell me what is going on?

1058
01:21:59,761 --> 01:22:01,761
You've been out of it since you came.

1059
01:22:03,763 --> 01:22:05,763
- I'm not in the mood to talk about it.

1060
01:22:04,763 --> 01:22:06,763
- Are you going to tell me?

1061
01:22:07,764 --> 01:22:09,764
- Are you sure you want to know?

1062
01:22:09,765 --> 01:22:11,765
- What do you mean? Of course I do.

1063
01:22:12,766 --> 01:22:14,766
And please tell me no matter what.

1064
01:22:19,769 --> 01:22:21,769
- I had to go help Gabitza have an abortion.

1065
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:26,770
- And that's what you needed the money for?

1066
01:22:28,772 --> 01:22:30,772
- Do you imagine that an abortion is 300 lei?

1067
01:22:29,772 --> 01:22:31,772
- Then what did you need them for?

1068
01:22:33,774 --> 01:22:35,774
- Don't worry, I'll give them back on Monday and that's the end of it.

1069
01:22:41,777 --> 01:22:43,777
- Look, my father had a colleague, a doctor, that got 3 years detention for an abortion.

1070
01:22:45,778 --> 01:22:47,778
- What if I get pregnant? what are we going to do then? Have you thought?

1071
01:22:46,778 --> 01:22:48,778
- Cut it out!

1072
01:22:47,779 --> 01:22:49,779
- No really, it can happen.

1073
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:52,780
And again, what would you do if I got pregnant?

1074
01:22:54,781 --> 01:22:56,781
- Don't roll your eyes. Have you thought?

1075
01:22:58,783 --> 01:23:00,783
- What exactly am I supposed to think about?

1076
01:23:01,784 --> 01:23:03,784
- What are we going to do if I get pregnant?

1077
01:23:03,785 --> 01:23:05,785
- But you won't .

1078
01:23:06,786 --> 01:23:08,786
- How do you know I'm not already?

1079
01:23:09,787 --> 01:23:11,787
- Are you?

1080
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:16,789
- You have no idea when I'm due for my period.

1081
01:23:15,789 --> 01:23:17,789
- I do know. Sometime these days, right?

1082
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:20,790
- What do you care? It's not your problem.

1083
01:23:20,791 --> 01:23:22,791
- Why are you saying that?

1084
01:23:24,792 --> 01:23:26,792
- Did it ever happen while we were together?

1085
01:23:29,794 --> 01:23:31,794
- Take Thursday, I asked you to take care, and come outside.

1086
01:23:31,795 --> 01:23:33,795
Remember? And you, you couldn't care less.

1087
01:23:32,795 --> 01:23:34,795
- How can you talk about this?

1088
01:23:36,797 --> 01:23:38,797
- You're not ashamed to do it, but you're ashamed to talk about it?

1089
01:23:40,798 --> 01:23:42,798
- I don't see the point of talking as long as you're not pregnant.

1090
01:23:42,799 --> 01:23:44,799
- I want to know what to expect of you.

1091
01:23:47,801 --> 01:23:49,801
- Don't worry, if it happens, I'll take care of it.

1092
01:23:51,802 --> 01:23:53,802
- Yeah, right... - What do you mean?

1093
01:23:55,804 --> 01:23:57,804
- Did you ever need anything and I didn't help?

1094
01:23:58,805 --> 01:24:00,805
- Do you at least know how many times I needed help?

1095
01:23:59,805 --> 01:24:01,805
You have no idea.

1096
01:24:01,806 --> 01:24:03,806
- It's not my fault that you don't talk about it!

1097
01:24:04,807 --> 01:24:06,807
Do you want me to take a guess about your problems?

1098
01:24:06,808 --> 01:24:08,808
- And the thing with Gabi, why didn't you tell me? I would have helped.

1099
01:24:10,809 --> 01:24:12,809
- Helped me? You can't even conceive the idea and you'd have helped?

1100
01:24:14,810 --> 01:24:16,810
- The main thing is for you to take care not to get pregnant.

1101
01:24:17,812 --> 01:24:19,812
- Don't bother, I wouldn't count on you anyway.

1102
01:24:20,813 --> 01:24:22,813
At least Gabitza, as plain as she is, would help me.

1103
01:24:22,813 --> 01:24:24,813
- Oh, and I wouldn't, or what?

1104
01:24:32,817 --> 01:24:34,817
I just said I don't condone abortion because it's very dangerous.

1105
01:24:33,817 --> 01:24:35,817
- So what would, according to you, be the solution?

1106
01:24:37,819 --> 01:24:39,819
- I don't know, I'd marry you.

1107
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:42,820
- So if I get pregnant...

1108
01:24:42,821 --> 01:24:44,821
- Just cut it out!

1109
01:24:45,822 --> 01:24:47,822
- Come on, I'm not spending the rest of my life cooking mashed potatoes for you.

1110
01:24:51,824 --> 01:24:53,824
- Otilia,did my parents' friends annoy you or what?

1111
01:24:54,825 --> 01:24:56,825
- They annoyed me too, but that is not the point.

1112
01:24:58,826 --> 01:25:00,826
I know that you also yhink my parents are simple people, without higher education.

1113
01:25:02,828 --> 01:25:04,828
- Did you ever hear me saying that? Did I ever say that to you?

1114
01:25:04,829 --> 01:25:06,829
- You didn't, but I know your opinion.

1115
01:25:06,829 --> 01:25:08,829
Actually, you did say it once.

1116
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:09,830
- What did I say?

1117
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:14,832
- Can I come in ? I brought you some creme broulee.

1118
01:25:13,832 --> 01:25:15,832
- Thank you.

1119
01:25:16,833 --> 01:25:18,833
- Save some space for the merengue cake.

1120
01:25:18,834 --> 01:25:20,834
- Why are the lights off?

1121
01:25:38,841 --> 01:25:40,841
- Could you please get me the phone?

1122
01:25:42,842 --> 01:25:44,842
- Look now...

1123
01:25:46,844 --> 01:25:48,844
I'm sorry if I made any mistake.

1124
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:53,846
You know I love you and I want for us to be together.

1125
01:25:53,846 --> 01:25:55,846
- Please get me that phone.

1126
01:25:54,847 --> 01:25:56,847
- Look, I appologized.

1127
01:25:55,847 --> 01:25:57,847
- You said you were sorry.

1128
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:04,850
And do you at least know what for?

1129
01:26:10,853 --> 01:26:12,853
Tell me, do you know what you're sorry about?

1130
01:26:12,853 --> 01:26:14,853
- I see that you're upset, and I don't want you to be upset over me.

1131
01:26:16,855 --> 01:26:18,855
If I made any mistake, it wasn't on purpose.

1132
01:26:20,856 --> 01:26:22,856
I want us to get along, ok ?

1133
01:26:23,857 --> 01:26:25,857
- Until what?

1134
01:26:26,858 --> 01:26:28,858
Until I get my allotment and I leave by myself?

1135
01:26:33,861 --> 01:26:35,861
I asked you not to touch me now.

1136
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:45,865
- It's going to work out.

1137
01:26:48,866 --> 01:26:50,866
We're going to leave for camp, it'll be just the two of us and we won't fight anymore.

1138
01:26:55,869 --> 01:26:57,869
- Please get me the phone.

1139
01:27:13,876 --> 01:27:15,876
Could you please give me some privacy while I talk to Gabitza?

1140
01:27:14,876 --> 01:27:16,876
It won't take long.

1141
01:27:28,881 --> 01:27:30,881
Good evening. Room 206, please.

1142
01:27:40,885 --> 01:27:42,885
Could you tell me, did anybody go up to 206?

1143
01:27:45,887 --> 01:27:47,887
I'm Mihartescu, you talked to me in the morning.

1144
01:27:49,889 --> 01:27:51,889
No, no, you don't have to go up.

1145
01:27:51,889 --> 01:27:53,889
Thank you.

1146
01:28:00,893 --> 01:28:02,893
I have to go.

1147
01:28:02,893 --> 01:28:04,893
- What is it, did something go bad with Gabi?

1148
01:28:06,895 --> 01:28:08,895
Stay around for just  5 minutes, they're cutting the merengue cake now.

1149
01:28:09,896 --> 01:28:11,896
- I'd like to, but I really can't.

1150
01:28:11,897 --> 01:28:13,897
Sorry.

1151
01:28:13,897 --> 01:28:15,897
- Then at least go in and say  " bye".

1152
01:28:18,899 --> 01:28:20,899
- You go in and tell them for me. I really can't stay anymore.

1153
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:23,900
- Do you realize how shitty I'll feel in front of them?

1154
01:28:24,901 --> 01:28:26,901
- I'm sorry.

1155
01:28:26,902 --> 01:28:28,902
Bye.

1156
01:28:32,904 --> 01:28:34,904
-Please don't walk me out. You really don't have to.

1157
01:28:47,910 --> 01:28:49,910
- Get inside. It's embarassing to sit here, waiting for the elevator.

1158
01:31:30,969 --> 01:31:32,969
- Good evening. 206 please.

1159
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:34,970
- Your ID.

1160
01:31:34,971 --> 01:31:36,971
- You have my ID. I showed it to the receptionist this morning.

1161
01:31:36,971 --> 01:31:38,971
- I need your ID.

1162
01:31:41,973 --> 01:31:43,973
- I think it's upstairs.

1163
01:31:44,974 --> 01:31:46,974
- Call the room, to bring it to you.

1164
01:31:46,975 --> 01:31:48,975
- I called the room earlier, and my friend was sleeping.

1165
01:31:49,976 --> 01:31:51,976
I'll be right back with it, I don't want to wake her up.

1166
01:31:53,977 --> 01:31:55,977
- Why don't you have your ID anyway?

1167
01:31:56,979 --> 01:31:58,979
- I just went out for some cigarettes and met someone, that's all.

1168
01:31:57,979 --> 01:31:59,979
- You went out...

1169
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:03,980
- I'll be back with it.

1170
01:32:42,995 --> 01:32:44,995
- Gabitza?

1171
01:32:47,997 --> 01:32:49,997
Gabitza?

1172
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
What's wrong?

1173
01:32:59,001 --> 01:33:01,001
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

1174
01:33:03,003 --> 01:33:05,003
- It got out.

1175
01:33:05,003 --> 01:33:07,003
It's gone.

1176
01:33:44,017 --> 01:33:46,017
- Pick it up.

1177
01:33:46,018 --> 01:33:48,018
Tell them I'll be right down.

1178
01:34:09,027 --> 01:34:11,027
Do you have a bag?

1179
01:34:11,027 --> 01:34:13,027
Tell me, do you have a bag or something?

1180
01:34:16,029 --> 01:34:18,029
- Will this do ?

1181
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:20,030
- It's too small.

1182
01:34:44,039 --> 01:34:46,039
- Burry it, ok?

1183
01:34:48,041 --> 01:34:50,041
Do you promise?

1184
01:34:50,041 --> 01:34:52,041
- Don't worry, I won't throw it away.

1185
01:34:53,043 --> 01:34:55,043
- You will be back, right?

1186
01:34:54,043 --> 01:34:56,043
- Cut it out.

1187
01:34:55,043 --> 01:34:57,043
Lock the door.

1188
01:34:58,044 --> 01:35:00,044
- If the receptionist comes, tell him I went down.

1189
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:33,100
- Do you know at what time the last bus comes?

1190
01:37:33,101 --> 01:37:35,101
- In about an hour, I guess.

1191
01:37:34,101 --> 01:37:36,101
I don't know.

1192
01:37:38,103 --> 01:37:40,103
- A cab around here?

1193
01:37:41,104 --> 01:37:43,104
- You won't find a cab in this neighbourhood Miss.

1194
01:37:43,104 --> 01:37:45,104
- Thanks.

1195
01:37:44,105 --> 01:37:46,105
- You're wellcome.

1196
01:42:18,204 --> 01:42:20,204
- Gabitza?

1197
01:42:28,208 --> 01:42:30,208
Gabitza?

1198
01:42:39,212 --> 01:42:41,212
Gabitza!

1199
01:42:49,216 --> 01:42:51,216
- What's going on ?

1200
01:42:51,216 --> 01:42:53,216
- Oh, they had a fight, at the wedding.

1201
01:42:54,218 --> 01:42:56,218
Your friend is waiting for you at the restaurant.

1202
01:42:56,218 --> 01:42:58,218
- My friend is waiting for me at the restaurant?

1203
01:42:57,219 --> 01:42:59,219
- Yes, she came down 5 minutes ago.

1204
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:02,220
Take the other way, because there's the wedding here.

1205
01:43:01,220 --> 01:43:03,220
- Thanks.

1206
01:43:14,225 --> 01:43:16,225
- What are you doing?

1207
01:43:17,226 --> 01:43:19,226
I didn't know where you where.

1208
01:43:21,227 --> 01:43:23,227
- I was very hungry.

1209
01:43:27,230 --> 01:43:29,230
I think I have a bit of a fever.

1210
01:43:28,230 --> 01:43:30,230
- Did you take an aspirin?

1211
01:43:30,231 --> 01:43:32,231
- I took an ampicilin.

1212
01:43:41,235 --> 01:43:43,235
- Did you burry it?

1213
01:43:47,237 --> 01:43:49,237
- You know what?

1214
01:43:53,239 --> 01:43:55,239
We'll never talk about this, ok?

1215
01:44:07,244 --> 01:44:09,244
- Are they serving anything at this hour?

1216
01:44:08,244 --> 01:44:10,244
- Yes, he's coming right away.

1217
01:44:23,250 --> 01:44:25,250
- What's that supposed to be?

1218
01:44:28,252 --> 01:44:30,252
- So, the menu from the wedding that it is : beef, pork, steamed liver, bread-crumbed brain.

1219
01:44:36,255 --> 01:44:38,255
- Could you bring us a bottle of mineral water, while we think about the order?
