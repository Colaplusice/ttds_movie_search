Sir, so is that your car?

27
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,940
You bitch,
you're dead if I catch you.

I'm back!

32
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,460
I'm sorry, sir.

33
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,820
Two of our girls ran away.
Business has been bad lately.

34
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,140
I've already put
such a big advance on those girls.

35
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,860
But sir, I can't get that much money
ready in three days.

36
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,580
Once I collect the money from them,
and pay you back...

37
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:09,860
Turn it off, asshole!

38
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,540
Can't you see
I was on the phone?

39
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,220
You have no fucking manners.

40
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,020
Did you hand them out?

41
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,260
- Yes, sir.
- Go hand out some more, idiot!

42
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,820
Dumb asshole.

43
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,580
Yes.

44
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,860
Where?

45
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,100
Hapjung district.

46
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,740
Provence Motel, room 301.

47
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,860
I'll send her now.

48
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,500
- Hello.
- Hey.

49
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,140
You came fast.

50
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,020
Seong-hee,
you don't look so young.

51
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,500
- How old are you?
- Thirty.

52
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,140
You took good care of yourself.
Nice body.

53
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,900
Why? Need to go pee?

54
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,100
- Yes.
- Later.

55
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,900
- No.
- Go later.

56
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,180
I told you to go later.

57
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,180
- What's wrong?
- Let go.

58
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,940
- Just wanted to take some pictures.
- Let go!

59
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,460
Okay, I'll pay you instead.

60
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,460
Let go, you pervert!

61
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,260
What?

62
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,180
Crazy assholes.

63
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,780
Where is she?

64
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,900
You fucking slut!

65
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,060
You call me a pervert, huh?

66
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,380
Watch your mouth, bitch!

67
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,180
You want to die, huh?

68
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,460
Come here, you bitch!

69
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,140
- Mister.
- You're dead!

70
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,620
She's leaving.
Calm down.

71
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,820
- Get out!
- Come here, bitch!

72
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,180
- Mister.
- Come over here!

73
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,980
- She's leaving.
- Bitch...

74
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,740
Come here, you bitch!
You're dead!

75
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,220
- She's leaving now.
- You bitch!

76
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,620
- Calm down...
- What the fuck...

77
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,460
Who the hell are you?

78
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,260
I'm her guardian, asshole.

79
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,340
Sit down.

80
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,380
Kneel down.

81
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,420
Cover yourself!

82
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,420
So what are you going to do?

83
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,380
Let's settle this.

84
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,580
Satisfied?

85
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,220
There you are.

86
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,460
Let me see.

87
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,300
I'm quitting for real.
Don't call me.

88
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,020
Hey!

89
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,980
Hey!

90
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,140
Did you find the girls?

91
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,100
Where did you find the car?

92
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
In Mangwon district.

93
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,060
Did you call the police?

94
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,420
You crazy?

95
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,140
Report girls who
ran away from me?

96
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,420
I told you they didn't run away.

97
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,220
You used to be a detective.

98
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,020
Then go find them
instead of ripping people off.

99
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,500
You crazy bitch,
who says I'm ripping people off?

100
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,380
I'm the one
who's being ripped off.

101
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,500
Bitches get a big advance from me
and then disappear.

102
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,900
Ask any asshole on the street
what it means.

103
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,580
Whether they've been sold
or ran away.

104
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,540
Rotten bastard.

105
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,020
Hey!

106
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,660
Hey! Seong-hee!

107
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,900
That damn temper of hers.

108
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,380
Meathead

109
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,380
What?

110
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,380
This bastard keeps rejecting the girls
and now there's no one left.

111
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,820
There's Mi-jin, idiot.

112
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,380
She wants to rest
because she's caught a cold.

113
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,420
Cold my ass. I'm hanging up.

114
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,700
What the fuck's wrong
with everyone?

115
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,500
Mom.

116
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,900
Mom!

117
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,220
What?

118
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,460
Take the medicine.

119
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,580
Bring me my cell phone, honey.

120
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,460
Filth

121
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,460
Yes, Jung-ho.

122
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,820
Where are you?

123
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,260
I'm sorry. I'm very sick.

124
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,820
Where are you sick?

125
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,700
I think it's a cold.
I also have a fever.

126
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,700
I'll take a day off.

127
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,940
A cold?

128
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,780
In the middle of summer?

129
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,220
Are you with a guy?

130
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,940
No.

131
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,980
Are you trying to run away
like the others?

132
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,980
What are you saying?

133
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,900
You better get to work
before you regret it.

134
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,020
Okay?

135
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,380
Why aren't you answering me?

136
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,620
Jung-ho, please.

137
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,980
Where do you live?
I'm going over right now.

138
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,820
Where is it?

139
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,540
Okay, I'll go.

140
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,180
Call Meathead.

141
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,580
Yes.

142
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,060
Damn it.

143
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
What's this?

144
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,020
You have to go?

145
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,820
I'll be back soon.

146
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,300
Yes, a Matiz.

147
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,980
I'm wearing a white cardigan
over a dress.

148
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,380
Did it turn on?

149
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,580
Yes.

150
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,780
4885?

151
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,060
4885...

152
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,420
I've heard of it.

153
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,100
4885?

154
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,060
Know this number?

155
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,420
Yes, sir.

156
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,420
He's a complete wacko.

157
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,500
Mi-jin went to serve
that bastard.

158
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,140
Ji-young

159
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,300
Mi-jin

160
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,620
Shit.

161
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,020
Where did she go?

162
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:19,980
To Mangwon district.

163
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,420
Yeah, it's that bastard.
He sold them.

164
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,620
It's me.
Just answer yes or no.

165
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,460
Are you with
that bastard now?

166
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,900
Your customer.

167
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,820
At a motel or his home?

168
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,020
Are you going to his house
in your car?

169
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,380
Okay, listen carefully.

170
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,140
Memorize his address
as you go into his house.

171
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,540
Just do as I say.

172
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,260
Don't get me upset.

173
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,140
Soon as you go in,
tell him you'll take a shower.

174
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,500
Then text me his address.
Simple, right?

175
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,460
Don't let him be suspicious.

176
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,740
You die if you screw up.

177
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,020
I'm finally lucky.

178
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,260
Shouldn't we report it?

179
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,180
Want to see
this business go down?

180
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,100
Look after the office.

181
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,660
Yes, sir.

182
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,420
Who is it?

183
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,220
My manager.

184
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,580
Your boss?

185
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,380
Yes.

186
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,020
Something wrong?

187
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,100
No, he's worried
that I'm sick.

188
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,900
Which way shall I go?

189
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,940
Over there.
Park in front of the guard post.

190
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,660
What a tough life.

191
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,260
The mayor of Seoul.

192
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,660
At the market at this hour.

193
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,220
Jung-ho, what's up?

194
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,460
Gil-woo, are you busy?

195
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,780
I'm busy, why?

196
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,580
Remember what I told you?

197
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,100
- What?
- About my girls running away.

198
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,060
They didn't run away.
They've been sold.

199
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,260
The same guy called for
the girls.

200
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,860
So?
Going to catch that asshole?

201
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,660
- Yes.
- Where are you?

202
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,780
Mangwon district.
Are you busy now?

203
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,660
I told you I'm busy.

204
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,580
I don't know
how many of them there are.

205
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,300
I might be outnumbered.

206
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,620
Could you send
a few ofyour guys at least?

207
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,620
History will be the judge!

208
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,060
Get the hell out!

209
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,020
Gil-woo?

210
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,260
Damn it.

211
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,700
It's here.

212
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,740
Mangwon district, 24-1

213
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,260
Something wrong?

214
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,300
No.

215
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,140
Come in.

216
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,420
Okay.

217
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,660
- Coming?
- Yes.

218
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,660
I'll take a shower.

219
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,820
Sure, it's over there.

220
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,140
Mangwon district

221
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,060
Sending

222
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,660
Message failed

223
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,020
I think I left the condom in my car.
I'll be right back.

224
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,260
Okay.

225
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,220
Mi-jin

226
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,540
Your call cannot be connected.

227
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,980
Damn it.

228
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,380
Mi-jin

229
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,020
- Your call cannot be connected.
- What the...

230
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,260
Hey.

231
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,980
Do you know Ji-young?

232
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,380
Haven't seen her for a while,
have you?

233
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,220
Hush, hush.

234
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,820
She kept screaming,
so I cut off her tongue.

235
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,820
Good.

236
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,100
Mi-jin.

237
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,180
Scared?

238
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,940
Do you want to go home?

239
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,980
Why do you
want to go home?

240
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,780
Tell me why you should live.

241
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,580
No reason?

242
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,380
Spare me.

243
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,940
Please let me live!

244
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,500
No reason, right?

245
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,300
Wait! I have one!

246
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,580
I have a daughter.

247
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,740
She's seven years old.

248
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,780
Nobody would even know
that you're dead.

249
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,060
Nobody will look for you.

250
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,580
Don't move.

251
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,500
Don't move.

252
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,820
It won't hurt at all.
None of them felt any pain.

253
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,060
It hurts if you move around.

254
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,660
Damn it.

255
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,780
9256-4885

256
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,460
Your call cannot be connected.

257
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,100
Damn it.

258
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,660
Damn it.

259
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,380
Who is it?

260
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,180
Sorry to disturb you so late.

261
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
Is Mr. Park home?

262
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,620
Who are you people?

263
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,460
Please leave

264
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,660
There's no one
by that name here.

265
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,260
Mr. Park hasn't come
to church lately.

266
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,020
There's no sign of him.

267
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,860
There's no such person here.

268
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,380
Then did he move?

269
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,700
I don't know.

270
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,460
Oh, goodness, it's Pungsan.

271
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,660
- Honey, isn't that Pungsan?
- You're right.

272
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,500
How'd you get so skinny?

273
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,660
Let's go.

274
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,180
Wait a minute. Look at her.

275
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,900
Why are you being
so stubborn?

276
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,980
- Pungsan!
- I'm sorry to disturb you.

277
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,100
Let's go.

278
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,980
Something's not right.

279
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,300
Wait a minute.

280
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,500
Sorry.

281
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,580
Actually, he's sleeping.

282
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,100
Come inside.

283
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,220
- Do you live around here?
- Yes.

284
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,900
Have you seen a guy and a girl
with long hair and a pale face?

285
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,860
No, I haven't.

286
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,300
- They were just here.
- Sorry.

287
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,340
Why do you keep on
bothering me?

288
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,940
Damn it.

289
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,100
Fuck.

290
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,660
I'm busy so just give me
your number.

291
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,100
The insurance will cover it.

292
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,620
I said
just give me your number.

293
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,260
Forget it. Just go.

294
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,700
What?

295
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,380
It's all right. Just leave.

296
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,980
Don't lay one on me later.
Just give me your number.

297
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,140
Mister!

298
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,100
I'm all right, okay?

299
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,180
Sir.

300
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,340
I made a mistake,
so I should make up for it.

301
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,580
It's okay.

302
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,980
Give me your number.
I'll take care of it, okay?

303
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,380
I said it's all right.

304
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,300
I'm really okay,
so can you move your car?

305
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,420
You don't have to pay me.

306
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,460
No, give me your number.
I'll pay for the damage.

307
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,340
You're hurt.

308
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,340
Isn't that blood?

309
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,340
What are you talking about?

310
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,660
Move your car!

311
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,780
I said move your car!
Are you deaf?

312
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,860
Lady, move your damn car!

313
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,180
Pull out!

314
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,380
- Pull out!
- Hey, 4885.

315
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,020
It's you, huh?

316
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,940
Oh, brother.

317
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,020
Son of a bitch.

318
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,060
Answer it, asshole.

319
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:34,100
You're dead meat.

320
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,460
Get out.

321
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,100
Hey! You!

322
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,580
Hey!

323
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,180
Son of a bitch.

324
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,620
Stop, you son of a bitch!

325
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,980
Wait till I catch you.

326
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,380
Son of a bitch.

327
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,940
Why are you running away?

328
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,620
Think you'd get away?

329
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,940
Asshole,
what did you do with my girls?

330
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,420
You already sold them?

331
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,580
Asshole, who the hell are you?

332
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,540
Ji Young-min
Anyang city

333
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,860
What the hell?

334
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,180
Where's your house?

335
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,500
Answer me.

336
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,940
Answer me now.

337
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,060
Anyang city.

338
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:58,060
That's your address on paper.
Where do you live now?

339
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,820
Not talking? You block me?

340
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,460
You son of a bitch.

341
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,260
You pain in the ass.

342
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,940
- Move, now!
- Move your car back!

343
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,580
Come here.

344
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,460
Bastards.

345
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,140
You caused this mess,
asshole!

346
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,780
Move.

347
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,780
Out of the way.

348
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,820
- Hey, Miss!
- What kind of person did do that...

349
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,860
Move.
Out of the way.

350
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,420
What are you doing?
Get out!

351
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,780
Get in the car.

352
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,740
If there's an accident,
you should go around.

353
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,340
This won't solve anything.

354
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,660
Move your car.

355
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,460
Reverse!
Move back!

356
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,500
Sir!

357
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,220
Hey, you!

358
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,500
You can't park like this.

359
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,940
Is that your car?

360
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,660
Yes.

361
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,300
Are you a cop?

362
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,180
Yes, I am.

363
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,060
Show me your badge.

364
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,500
I left it at the police station.

365
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,260
This is 390.

366
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,980
Come in Mangwon station.

367
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,420
ID check.

368
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,020
What station do you work at?

369
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,620
I was in a task force unit
two years ago.

370
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,140
Let's call them.

371
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,580
Let's go to the station first.

372
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,980
But my girls are being sold
this very moment.

373
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,500
Shut up! Let's go and talk!

374
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,180
You son of a bitch.

375
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,100
I told you to shut up!

376
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,540
Damn it.

377
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,180
No answer?

378
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:44,220
No cell phone, either.
Nothing he says makes sense.

379
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,740
All we need to do
is go to his house.

380
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,780
Please write it all down,
frankly.

381
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,060
Yes, sir.

382
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,500
People like him need to be deported.
How dare you impersonate a cop!

383
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,740
Asshole, tell the truth.
Where did you sell the girls?

384
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,980
Be quiet!

385
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,140
Why are you shouting?

386
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,940
Ask that bastard directly.

387
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,380
You're out of line.

388
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,500
Ask him!
Don't just get on my case!

389
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,620
You really sold them?

390
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,220
Are you crazy?

391
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,500
Sorry.
He just wanted me to ask.

392
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,540
This is fucking insane.

393
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,820
Block them, idiot!

394
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,020
Be quiet!

395
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,820
Which hospital?

396
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,020
St. Mary's Hospital.
I'll call you from there.

397
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,580
Why'd you throw shit on
his face, you crazy bastard?

398
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,580
Yes, Captain.
I'm on my way now.

399
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,900
How can I stop someone
who pops up out of nowhere?

400
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,140
Hey, cover the seat first
before he gets in.

401
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,540
Yes, the rest went to
the hospital.

402
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,300
Yes, I'll bring him in first.

403
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,500
Mr. Ji Young-min,
whose car is that?

404
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,060
- Pardon? Car?
- Yes.

405
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,620
It belongs to someone I know.

406
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,540
Who is that person you know?

407
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,700
What?

408
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,100
What's his name?

409
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,260
I can't remember.

410
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,820
Do you know his number?

411
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,300
It's at home.

412
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,420
Something wrong?

413
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,580
No, it's strange you don't know
the car owner.

414
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,820
I have a very bad memory.

415
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,020
Okay, just keep writing.

416
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,740
Mr. Ji, does your number
start with 01 1 or 01 6?

417
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,980
01 6

418
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,900
I thought
you didn't have a phone.

419
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,820
What?

420
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,660
Where's your cell phone?

421
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,580
At home.

422
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,420
Then why did you lie?

423
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,900
Tell me your number.

424
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,620
It's 4885, right?

425
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,900
No.

426
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,500
Come on, I can find out easily.

427
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,140
Did you sell the girls?

428
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,580
No.

429
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,140
Come on,
did you sell the girls?

430
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,340
I said no.

431
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,940
I didn't sell them.

432
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,540
- I killed them...
- What?

433
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,140
- Nothing.
- You just said something.

434
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,260
- What?
- You said that you killed them.

435
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,100
Yes.

436
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,540
What?

437
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,060
Yes, I killed them.

438
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,700
Whose shit is it?
Is it yours?

439
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,900
History will be the judge of things!
Damn you all!

440
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,700
- Crazy asshole.
- What a crazy...

441
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,460
We're in deep trouble for this.

442
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,020
This is crazy.

443
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,460
I've been suffering.

444
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,060
They've stopped the water supply
and I haven't washed for ages.

445
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,980
Jung-ho
I can't even flush
my own shit.

446
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,980
Shut the hell up!

447
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,700
Be quiet.

448
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,740
What?

449
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,380
I'm busy now.

450
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,940
What are you talking about?

451
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,780
How do you know
whether he killed them or not?

452
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,100
Anyway...

453
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,660
Yes.

454
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,380
Nine of them?

455
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,620
He said he killed nine people?

456
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,420
Hey, Jung-ho.

457
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,820
Bastard.

458
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,540
That Son of...

459
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,860
Detective Oh.

460
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,900
Yes?

461
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,900
Remember
the Mapo murder case?

462
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,940
- Three murdered women?
- Yeah.

463
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,260
How many occurred
in Mangwon district?

464
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,140
All of them happened
in Mangwon.

465
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,580
In the ally at dawn.

466
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Really?

467
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,380
Why?

468
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,980
Never mind.

469
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,260
What shall we do?

470
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,580
Let's take him in first.

471
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,300
His statement makes sense.

472
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,060
It does, doesn't it?

473
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,260
Bunch of idiots wasting time.

474
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,660
What did you say?

475
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,100
You're way out of line.

476
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,060
Watch what you say.

477
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,220
He's pretending to
be crazy now.

478
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,460
Hey!

479
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,180
Shut up, you pimp.

480
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,780
You're worse than
this asshole.

481
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:22,220
You sell out your old police badge
to pimp girls.

482
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,220
Take him to the car.

483
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,820
- Yes?
- Put him in the car!

484
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,780
Yes, sir!

485
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,060
We're not taking the blame
for him beating this guy up.

486
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,660
Let's not be like this, okay?

487
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,220
Let's go.
Hurry up.

488
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,020
Hello.

489
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,260
Gil-woo!

490
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,540
Where are you going?

491
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,580
Those idiots are holding him.

492
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,940
- And just...
- Hold on.

493
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,220
Can I help you?

494
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,500
I'm from the Task Force Unit.

495
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,020
Where?

496
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,860
The Task Force Unit
at the Seoul station.

497
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,580
You must've come
for the Mapo case files.

498
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,260
No, I came for that guy.

499
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,740
What?

500
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,980
I'm taking him in.

501
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,300
Sorry to wake you up, sir.

502
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,300
What is this all about?

503
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,380
It's a bit complicated.

504
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,940
Damn it!

505
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,180
Who is this?

506
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,020
Yes, this man is...

507
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,340
Is he the shit thrower?

508
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,780
Yes, I believe so.

509
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,580
Crazy bastard,
why'd you throw shit at someone?

510
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,580
What is he saying?

511
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,420
Looks like he has to urinate.
Would you like to talk to him?

512
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,780
Forget it.

513
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,980
So are you sure about this?

514
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,140
Yes, Gil-woo is.

515
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,060
Don't use him as an excuse.

516
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,660
- Sorry, sir.
- Okay.

517
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,700
You son of bitch!

518
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,500
Why is it so noisy in here!

519
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,900
Sir!

520
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,900
Crazy bastards.

521
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,900
Who's Ji Young-min?

522
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,100
Are you Ji Young-min?

523
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,100
Yes.

524
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,540
What happened to your face?

525
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,300
Are you all out of your minds?

526
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:14,180
Sir, we didn't do anything.

527
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,620
Shut up!

528
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,060
Come outside.

529
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,260
Come out now!

530
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,380
- Have a good life.
- Let me loose.

531
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,780
Who beat him?

532
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,100
- Well...
- They did it?

533
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,780
- I don't know, sir.
- Find out who beat him

534
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,060
and then bring him in.

535
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,340
Yes, sir!

536
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,340
- You know the situation we're in?
- Yes, sir.

537
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,940
We're all dead if this case fails.

538
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,100
Yes, sir.

539
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,340
Who did this to you?

540
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,780
That guy inside.

541
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,300
- Who?
- Hey!

542
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:58,100
There's more than
one in there!

543
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,500
That man over there.

544
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,540
Come here,
you son of a bitch.

545
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,140
You lie to all of them?

546
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:04,980
You son of a bitch!

547
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,100
- Chill.
- That little...!

548
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,020
Cut it out.
Let's go to the station first.

549
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,220
Jung-ho, you can do it there.

550
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,740
Right, let's go.

551
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,540
Gil-woo, come here.

552
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,860
Let's go and do it, okay?

553
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,460
You're sure about this, right?

554
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,500
Yes, I'm sure.

555
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,140
- Absolutely sure?
- Yes, I am.

556
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,660
Okay, let's go.

557
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,860
- Let's go.
- Okay.

558
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,060
- Wait! Stop!
- Why?

559
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,020
Where'd that bastard go?

560
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,860
- Who?
- Jung-ho.

561
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,220
Damn it.

562
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,620
There's that bastard.

563
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,460
Hey!

564
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,700
Come to the office!

565
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,740
- Okay.
- You better come!

566
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,060
Okay!

567
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,060
Owner:Kwon Hae-gab

568
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:18,940
Damn bastard.

569
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,540
Hey.

570
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,740
Hey!

571
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,740
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

572
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,180
What did you kill the girls with?

573
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,780
With a chisel.

574
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,780
The ones to crack stones?

575
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,020
Yes.

576
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,060
- Is that right?
- Yes,

577
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,580
it was a narrow
blunt instrument.

578
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,660
Okay.

579
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,580
I need to pee really bad.
Let me out.

580
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,620
Shut up.

581
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:23,500
Or else I'll yank your dick out.

582
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,300
Detective.

583
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,740
What?

584
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,300
Kim Mi-jin is probably still alive.

585
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,620
What's he talking about?

586
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,020
Kim Mi-jin.

587
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,620
The girl that guy was looking for.

588
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:37,940
Where is she now?

589
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,380
In Anyang city?

590
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,100
Why?

591
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,500
Why would the victim be there?

592
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,460
Wait, stop the car.

593
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,900
That's just his address on paper.
He lives in Mangwon district.

594
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,500
That's where I caught him.

595
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,980
Bastard hangs up the phone
before I'm finished.

596
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:04,980
Car registration

597
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,460
Who is it?

598
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,820
Do you know this man?

599
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,340
No.

600
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,300
These keys?

601
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:38,940
I don't know.

602
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,580
Look carefully.

603
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,220
It's the first time I've seen it.

604
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,100
Where did they go?

605
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,460
They were going to some meeting,
but I don't remember.

606
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,500
Yanpyung 11a.m.
Yangpyung?

607
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,580
Yes, I think so.

608
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:57,940
Yangpyung is...

609
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:02,380
Anyway, they must've past
the corner store.

610
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,900
What took you so long, idiot?

611
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,420
What happened?

612
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:14,260
What about Mi-jin?

613
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,500
I couldn't find her.

614
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:16,940
What?

615
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,460
See that store
across the street?

616
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,780
- Yes.
- See that alley next to it?

617
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,580
- Yes.
- So,

618
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:26,060
Search every house from there
to this address with this.

619
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,180
- What is this?
- Find houses

620
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:34,220
with basements,
where the cell phone wouldn't work.

621
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,140
Where is this house?

622
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,620
Come here.

623
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,220
- See that top over there?
- Yes.

624
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,780
Where the hell
are you looking, idiot?

625
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,700
That top over the cross.

626
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,260
Yes.

627
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,780
Right there.

628
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,820
Why don't we just report it?

629
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,180
They know already.

630
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,180
Then why
go through the trouble?

631
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,020
Just do what I say, asshole.

632
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,740
We have to find Mi-jin.

633
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,340
I got it.

634
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:07,580
Search every corner!

635
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:08,740
Okay!

636
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,060
Shit.

637
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,980
If you make an arrest
without a warrant,

638
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,380
you need approval by
a prosecutor within 1 2 hours.

639
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,380
1 2 hours?

640
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,940
Yes.

641
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,980
What if it isn't approved?

642
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,180
We have to release him.

643
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:45,340
Shit.

644
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,580
Where are you?

645
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,380
It's already two.
What have you been doing?

646
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:54,100
Why'd you go to Mangwon
after Anyang city?

647
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,940
Then you should've dropped off
the shit thrower.

648
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,180
Sit down.

649
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:28,980
So did you hit them with a chisel
or hammer them with it?

650
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,820
Used the hammer, of course.

651
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,460
Give me your hand.

652
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,340
Relax.

653
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:37,740
Why'd you kill them like that?

654
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,620
I choked them and used knives,
but they were too painful.

655
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,860
I saw how pigs were killed
and did the same.

656
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,220
And then?

657
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,060
- Hang them on the wall.
- What?

658
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,180
Yes?

659
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,140
Hang what?

660
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,780
Their bodies, of course.

661
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,020
Say ah.

662
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,500
And then?

663
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,180
You know that muscle
behind the ankles?

664
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,620
- The Achilles tendon?
- Yes.

665
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,540
I slice it with a knife.

666
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,780
- Of the dead body?
- Yes.

667
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,100
Why?

668
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,900
To drain out the blood.
Otherwise they're too heavy to lift.

669
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,300
That's right.

670
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,700
That's how
the corpses get lighter.

671
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:20,860
So what did you do next?

672
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:25,180
Leave it around for a day,
drain out all the blood and mess.

673
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,700
Then I ax the bodies
and bury them.

674
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:28,940
Where?

675
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:29,980
Yes?

676
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,100
Where'd you bury
the dead bodies?

677
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,540
Here and there.

678
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,780
Here and there is where?
Tell me exactly.

679
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,220
Well...

680
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,980
You wouldn't have buried
nine people in your front yard.

681
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,580
Not nine.

682
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,020
What?

683
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,180
It's twelve.

684
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,940
Why twelve? Wasn't it nine?

685
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,500
Come to think of it,
it was twelve.

686
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:58,940
Are you kidding me?

687
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,020
Gil-woo!

688
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:07,780
Just tell us what you remember.

689
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,700
You're doing well.

690
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,460
I was driving
and the Equus popped out.

691
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,740
It slammed into my car,
and this rat was driving.

692
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,580
That's why you beat him?

693
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,740
No, I held on to him
and called 4885.

694
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,260
- And his phone is...
- Hey.

695
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,420
Just answer what I ask you.

696
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,900
So you beat him, right?

697
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:31,060
It was you
who messed up his face, right?

698
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:34,700
What are you doing?

699
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,580
Yes? Now?

700
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,980
Yes, sir.

701
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,300
The chief wants to see you.

702
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,460
Testimony
First, press your finger.

703
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,460
Go to Mi-jin's house?

704
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,820
Yes, go with him.

705
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,980
- Why?
- To do a DNA test

706
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,900
on the blood
on his shirt and her samples.

707
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,700
So you actually believe
what this bastard's saying?

708
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:16,820
Hey! Just go!

709
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,500
I doubt this bastard killed anyone.
Just search the neighborhood.

710
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:21,740
Hey! Jung-ho!

711
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,620
Give me a break.

712
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,100
Does it taste delicious,
you bastard!

713
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,820
Why do you keep hitting him?

714
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,740
Is this time to eat chocolate?

715
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,380
Hey! Jung-ho!

716
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,780
Bastard.

717
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,340
Is it true that the suspect
threw human feces?

718
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,540
Have you identified
the suspect?

719
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,580
Almost there.

720
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,220
Turn right and go straight?

721
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,500
Straight in?

722
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,460
Steps?

723
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,260
Downstairs?

724
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,180
The first one?

725
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,940
Okay.

726
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,820
Anybody home?
Anybody there?

727
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,820
Of course nobody's here.

728
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,580
What shall we do now?

729
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:28,500
Let's go to
the owner's house.

730
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,420
Move, move.

731
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,780
What is that?

732
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:39,700
You scared me.

733
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,500
You should've answered
if you were inside.

734
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,700
- Is this the police?
- Hey, you!

735
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,060
Strangers are breaking in.

736
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:47,740
Mapo-gu Sangsoo-dong 21-1 5.

737
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,140
They're coming inside!

738
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,500
Give it to me.

739
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:57,060
Who the hell are you?

740
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:59,740
I'm asking you.

741
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,460
Are you Mi-jin's daughter?

742
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,540
This place is a mess.

743
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,260
What are you doing here?

744
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,460
Go stay over there.

745
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,180
Why are you
taking someone's hair?

746
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,780
You little prick, go away.

747
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,380
Why are you taking her hair?

748
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,060
Aren't you going to sleep?

749
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,980
You go to sleep.

750
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:37,980
You're just like your mom.

751
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,420
What about my mom?

752
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,860
You little brat.

753
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,340
All done. So what now?

754
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,540
Leave, of course.

755
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,420
What's your name?

756
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,820
Take it.

757
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,100
Call me
if you get into any trouble.

758
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:05,420
Let's go.

759
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,900
Damn it.

760
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:28,540
According to witnesses,

761
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,620
Bastard made me
lose my appetite.

762
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,100
Where's my mom?

763
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,620
She's working.

764
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,620
Then why'd you take her hair?

765
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:40,980
For a DNA test?

766
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:44,820
You're unbelievable.

767
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,860
My mom isn't working now,
is she?

768
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,300
Something happened to her?

769
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:56,060
Don't you have
somewhere to go?

770
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,860
How much did you search?

771
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:05,660
I'll be there soon,
so search around some more.

772
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:10,660
Also, do you know anyone
who can look after a kid?

773
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:14,660
Okay, bye.

774
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,180
Look behind you!

775
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,100
Is there a cigarette?

776
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,060
Yes.

777
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,380
Get back there.

778
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,260
Throw it out the window.

779
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,540
Is it gone?

780
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,900
Yes.

781
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:40,500
Is there a burned mark?

782
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,100
Yes.

783
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,540
Damn it, nothing's helping me.

784
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,460
What a day.

785
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,940
You called my mom before,
right?

786
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,700
Didn't you ask my mom
to go to work tonight?

787
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,300
I'll send you back home
if you keep bothering me.

788
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:58,500
Filth.

789
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,700
What did you say?

790
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,420
What? Filth?

791
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,300
Get out!

792
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:12,020
The Mapo murders
are also included.

793
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,540
But who's this woman
that's alive?

794
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:17,860
He seems to be lying.
She's probably been murdered.

795
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,980
Except for the Mapo murders,

796
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,460
they were killed at his house
and you can't find the bodies?

797
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:23,420
No, sir.

798
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:24,660
If you don't know the address,

799
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,580
it means
you don't know anything.

800
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:29,300
The suspect can't remember
the address,

801
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:32,460
but we can find it quickly
if we start searching in the morning.

802
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:36,020
Why aren't his motives
written down?

803
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:39,180
He kept on talking gibberish.
No particular motivation.

804
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,340
Then make one up!
What the hell is this?

805
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,980
Yes, sir.

806
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:46,940
You know
the situation we're in?

807
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,060
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

808
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,900
We die if we blow this.

809
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,140
Get this right
if you want to keep your jobs.

810
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:55,540
So that the mayor's incident
shuts up, okay?

811
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:56,620
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

812
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:00,740
Who is it?

813
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,540
The police. Open the door.

814
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:08,900
Sit down.

815
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,060
Sit comfortably.

816
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,380
Yes.

817
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,500
Lady.

818
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:16,580
How can a sister
not know where her brother lives?

819
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,580
We really don't know.

820
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,620
We haven't seen him
for a long time.

821
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,180
How long?

822
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,540
About three years.

823
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:27,980
Where did he live then?

824
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,380
In prison, right?

825
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,780
Yes, in prison.

826
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,900
What a screwed-up family.

827
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,460
Now let's put things
in order, yes?

828
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:39,100
Like I said before,

829
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:44,380
your brother and brother-in-law
sold three of my girls.

830
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,260
But I've paid twenty thousand
for those girls.

831
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,100
What shall we do about that?

832
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:59,060
Let's sign a contract.

833
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,820
Why aren't you answering?

834
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:11,420
Byeong-soo!

835
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,740
Are you all right?

836
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:15,940
Everything's okay.

837
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,260
He was like this
ever since he was a baby.

838
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:27,140
My son was bleeding
when I came back home.

839
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:30,500
My damn brother
was the only one home.

840
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:34,060
Ever since then,
I barely saw my brother.

841
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,660
Where are we going?

842
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:41,740
I said where are we going?

843
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,380
We're not looking for my mom,
are we?

844
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,860
Be quiet!

845
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,740
Let me think.

846
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,460
Is your name Oh Eun-shil?

847
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:02,540
Why?

848
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:05,620
Your eyes are very pretty.

849
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,420
Shut up.

850
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,300
Why'd you cut your hair
so short?

851
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,420
You'd look sexy with long hair.

852
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:27,100
- Hey!
- Yes?

853
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,580
- You want a beating?
- No.

854
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:40,900
Just sit and
don't screw around.

855
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,780
You're not wearing
any perfume.

856
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:54,420
You must be on your period.
Smells fishy.

857
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,980
Is this a call-girl massage parlor?

858
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:20,420
Let me ask you something.

859
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:26,940
What's up?

860
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,460
We're in deep trouble.

861
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:34,420
That asshole has done this
twice before.

862
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:35,860
What are you talking about?

863
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,860
The prosecutor called.

864
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:40,660
Young-min said he killed
someone before.

865
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,940
But he was freed since
there wasn't enough evidence.

866
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:46,020
The prosecutor ordered him
to be freed.

867
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:48,900
The chief is going to
have a fit.

868
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,020
We're screwed.

869
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:54,540
You want to die?

870
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,300
Did you kill them or not?

871
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:01,380
Answer me, you bastard!

872
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,940
Young-min,
you told us everything before.

873
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:05,660
What's wrong with you?

874
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:07,220
Turn the camera.

875
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,220
Let me ask you once more.

876
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,460
Did you kill them or not?

877
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,420
I'm sorry.

878
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,940
Who the hell
do you think you are?

879
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:23,140
You must think
we're some damn clowns.

880
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:29,660
I checked.

881
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:32,460
Noryangjin station's warrant
was rejected by the judge.

882
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:34,060
Eunpyung station was like us.

883
01:02:34,220 --> 01:02:35,540
Both stations
had insufficient evidence.

884
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:38,660
Screw them.
That asshole is the murderer.

885
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:41,540
He can't make that kind of statement
if he hadn't killed them.

886
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:42,980
That's right.

887
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,260
So do you want to let him go?

888
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:50,460
Or search that neighborhood
to find some evidence?

889
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,100
Listen carefully.

890
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:54,100
He said he buried
the victims,

891
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:56,140
- Right?
- Yes, sir.

892
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,540
It means he buried
the victims somewhere else.

893
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:01,220
He couldn't have buried
all 1 2 bodies in his front yard.

894
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,340
- In the mountain!
- Yes,

895
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:04,940
but are there
many mountains there?

896
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:06,420
No, sir.

897
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:09,340
No, there is only one.
Sungmi Mountain.

898
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,260
- Am I right?
- Yes, sir.

899
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:12,900
Go search there.

900
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,380
Find the dead bodies.

901
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,340
Are you really a cop?

902
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,420
Show me your badge.

903
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,620
I can't believe this.

904
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,700
You're not a cop, are you?

905
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:48,780
Fuck.

906
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,220
Fuck?

907
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:54,620
Get lost.

908
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:10,940
Repeat this number,
016-9265-4885.

909
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,580
9265-4885...

910
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,820
Find it.

911
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,300
See if anyone's coming!

912
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:28,660
Here.

913
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:32,060
Hyun-ju

914
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:33,300
Where is she?

915
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:34,540
Not here.

916
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:37,020
She disappeared on this day?

917
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:38,260
Don't know.

918
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:40,580
Not knowing doesn't resolve things,
you bastard.

919
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:41,940
You didn't even look for her?

920
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:55,820
Where's your dad?

921
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:57,820
He's in Brazil

922
01:04:57,980 --> 01:04:58,980
Brazil?

923
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,820
Where in Brazil?

924
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,460
Rio de Janeiro.

925
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:05,780
What?

926
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,220
The old capital of Brazil.

927
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:11,260
What's he doing there?

928
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:12,980
Working.

929
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,220
Have you seen your dad?

930
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:20,740
No.

931
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,820
Did you talk on
the phone with him?

932
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,860
Damn.

933
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:33,900
What a bitch.

934
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:35,820
Better off saying Saudi Arabia.

935
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,020
Eat up.

936
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:46,940
What a damn temper.

937
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,140
Are you okay?

938
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:07,660
Yes.

939
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:10,820
Damn it.

940
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:14,180
Shit!

941
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:40,340
I've found it.

942
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,540
- Where?
- Right here.

943
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:44,860
Hee-jeong

944
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:46,020
Where is she now?

945
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:47,940
- Yes?
- Where's Hee-jeong?

946
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:49,380
She's gone, too?

947
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:52,140
She went to a customer.

948
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,540
He's a complete lunatic.

949
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:56,180
So do you know
where he lives?

950
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:57,620
No.

951
01:06:57,740 --> 01:06:58,580
Then where were you two?

952
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,180
Somewhere around here.

953
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:03,260
Was there anything
strange about him?

954
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:04,820
A lot.

955
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:06,260
Tell me.

956
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:10,100
His dick wouldn't get hard.

957
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:12,980
Watch what
you say around the kid.

958
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:15,100
I mean,

959
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:19,020
his penis didn't get erect.

960
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:21,020
So?

961
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:23,220
No matter how hard I tried,
it wouldn't work.

962
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,500
He said
he wasn't drunk, either.

963
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:27,620
That meant he was impotent.

964
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:29,940
Why'd an impotent bastard
call me then?

965
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:30,900
Then what?

966
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:32,340
What else?

967
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:34,340
I treated him like a king
so that I can keep the money.

968
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:38,100
Then he kept calling me,
asking me to live with him.

969
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,180
I got aggravated
so I didn't answer.

970
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:41,820
Then that crazy bastard

971
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:44,420
started sending me
strange pictures.

972
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:48,460
He was covered with blood
and said he'd kill me.

973
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:52,300
He kept bothering me like that
for several days.

974
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:53,820
Do you still have the pictures?

975
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:56,580
Are you crazy?
I erased all of them.

976
01:07:58,460 --> 01:07:59,660
Okay.

977
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:01,860
Did he do something?

978
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:04,460
He killed someone, didn't he?

979
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,020
Hey, mister!

980
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:10,420
Mister!

981
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:12,900
Hey...

982
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:44,780
Don't go anywhere.

983
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:47,180
- Where is it?
- Over here.

984
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:51,100
Here.

985
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:14,100
Are you sure this is it?

986
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:15,860
Yes, look.

987
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,460
Is this the wrong place?

988
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:28,340
Tell me what's going on.

989
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:29,660
Search some more
with the keys.

990
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:30,620
Why?

991
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:32,540
Mi-jin isn't here, idiot!

992
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,340
Let's go.

993
01:10:54,340 --> 01:10:55,660
Meathead!

994
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,220
- Where did he go?
- I don't know!

995
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:56,740
You go over there.

996
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:16,100
I told you I'd pay you back,
asshole!

997
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:19,460
I have to live, too!

998
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:28,020
Why'd he call me out
in such a hurry?

999
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:29,740
It's a big headache.

1000
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:31,460
Damn it.

1001
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,740
- Eun-shil, go wash up.
- Okay.

1002
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:42,980
Did you laugh? Did you?

1003
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:51,580
Get up, asshole.
We have a guest.

1004
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:56,980
Son of a bitch.

1005
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,460
Wake me up if anyone comes.

1006
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:08,580
Where is Kim Mi-jin?

1007
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,420
I don't know who she is.

1008
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,660
Where is she?

1009
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:16,620
Where is she? Answer me!

1010
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:19,580
Spare me.

1011
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:23,420
Where is she?

1012
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:26,100
I really don't know.
Spare me.

1013
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:46,260
We shared
the same prison cell.

1014
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,740
He visited me four months ago.

1015
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:52,580
He needed a place to stay
for two weeks.

1016
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:56,220
I haven't seen him
since then.

1017
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:59,980
Oh yeah, I saw him once.

1018
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:03,740
He came in and took his bag
while I was asleep.

1019
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:04,780
What sort of bag?

1020
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:16,380
A large black bag.

1021
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:18,620
It had all kinds of tools in it.

1022
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:19,620
What tools?

1023
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:22,020
Just tools.

1024
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:25,100
Like a chisel,
hammer and saw.

1025
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:26,740
Did he say
where he was going?

1026
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:28,180
No.

1027
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,180
Who painted all this?

1028
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:52,820
He did.

1029
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:55,220
No.

1030
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:58,460
Then what about a girlfriend?

1031
01:14:58,620 --> 01:14:59,620
No.

1032
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:05,860
Have you ever had
a girlfriend?

1033
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:06,940
Yes.

1034
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,980
How long was
your relationship?

1035
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:13,260
About a year.

1036
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:18,540
Then you must've had
sex with her.

1037
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:23,980
Why? Are you embarrassed?

1038
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:27,340
Just tell me.

1039
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:32,220
Have you ever had sex
with your girlfriend?

1040
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:35,780
Mr. Ji.

1041
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:40,180
Have you ever had sex
with a woman?

1042
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,420
Why do you want to know?

1043
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,620
Don't answer
if you don't want to.

1044
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:49,700
I'll ask something else.
At your house...

1045
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:51,820
I asked you.
Why you do you want to know?

1046
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:57,180
I thought that
you might be impotent.

1047
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,740
How would you know?
Have you seen it?

1048
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:05,900
Because assholes like you
mostly are.

1049
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:14,140
You're impotent, aren't you?

1050
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:16,940
When you see a woman,

1051
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:20,100
you want to have sex
but you can't.

1052
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:23,740
So you kill them
with a chisel, right?

1053
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:28,020
You think
the chisel is your penis.

1054
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:32,380
The pleasure from hammering
the chisel on a woman's head.

1055
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:33,140
Stop it.

1056
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:35,620
You killed young women
because of that pleasure.

1057
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:38,500
Stop it. That's not it.

1058
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:42,740
That's not why.

1059
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,260
Are you curious?

1060
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:51,860
I'll tell you.

1061
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:53,780
Why'd you kill them?

1062
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:04,020
Come here.
I'll tell you why.

1063
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:06,420
Come over here.

1064
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:13,780
- Just sit down.
- I'll tell you.

1065
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:15,540
Go sit down, you bastard.

1066
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:18,580
Sit.

1067
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:37,100
I'm right, aren't l?

1068
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:40,740
You want to have sex,
but your body can't.

1069
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:42,300
So the women...

1070
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:44,980
- What do you know?
- Let go!

1071
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:46,700
What do you know?

1072
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:48,540
Stop it!

1073
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:54,660
Why do you keep
bothering me? Why?

1074
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:56,980
Bravo.

1075
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:41,180
Hey, where's the kid?

1076
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,980
What?

1077
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:44,340
Where's the kid?

1078
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:46,260
- What?
- You dumb ass.

1079
01:18:57,980 --> 01:18:59,580
Go that way, idiot!

1080
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:43,420
Over here! Hurry!

1081
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:45,340
- Hurry!
- This way!

1082
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:04,220
Are you her father?

1083
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:06,620
You didn't sign here.

1084
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:42,940
From now on,
we're searching

1085
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:45,060
Mangwon to find
Ji Young-min's place.

1086
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:48,140
The residents will be awake,
and we'll have more backup.

1087
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:51,300
We have no warrant and
no approval, so by twelve,

1088
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:54,740
bring back any evidence,
if you need to fake it, got it?

1089
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,020
Yes, sir.

1090
01:20:56,140 --> 01:20:59,380
You call that a response,
you bastards?

1091
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:00,700
Yes, sir!

1092
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:16,900
Tell me where it is!

1093
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:18,460
Where is it?

1094
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:23,140
Answer me, you asshole!

1095
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:27,180
Tell me!

1096
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,180
Where is it? Where is it?

1097
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:32,740
Answer me,
you son of a bitch!

1098
01:21:33,940 --> 01:21:34,940
What's the matter?

1099
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:38,780
What is it?

1100
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:52,500
Go inside.

1101
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:55,380
What happened?

1102
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:56,700
What did he say?

1103
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:00,660
He confessed.
Mangwon, 893-1.

1104
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:25,660
- Move your ass!
- Get in there fast!

1105
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:28,540
Dig deep all around, got it?

1106
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:29,500
Yes, sir.

1107
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:30,940
Run inside!

1108
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:35,100
Hurry up!

1109
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:38,060
Dig inside!

1110
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:39,580
You bastard!

1111
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:41,020
Where were you?

1112
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:43,900
You can't dig
with a walkie-talkie, idiot!

1113
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:48,060
Come over here.
There's something strange here.

1114
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:53,100
Not there, come over here.
There's something strange.

1115
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:54,260
Yeah?

1116
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:57,620
Hey, hang it over there.

1117
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:58,660
Yes, sir.

1118
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:02,780
Is there anything?

1119
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:05,180
Look, isn't this blood?

1120
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:08,260
Not blood.
It looks like hot sauce.

1121
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:11,140
It is hot sauce.

1122
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:12,860
Asshole.

1123
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:16,220
That means he's worked here
up until six months ago.

1124
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:16,900
Yes.

1125
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:18,340
And you didn't know
when he came and went?

1126
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:22,900
How would I know
if he sneaked in here at night?

1127
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:24,660
Do you know
how many people he's killed?

1128
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:26,580
Shit, this is crazy.

1129
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,380
I really don't know anything!

1130
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:30,500
- Don't yell at me.
- It's not here.

1131
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:32,620
Get out.

1132
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:35,500
- If we find...
- Mi-jin isn't here.

1133
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:39,820
We're right here.

1134
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:41,820
Her car is parked here.

1135
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:43,460
This doesn't make sense.

1136
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:45,860
Why doesn't it?

1137
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:48,940
It's more than a 20-minute walk
from her car to here.

1138
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:50,580
It's here.

1139
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:51,900
Five minutes away.

1140
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:53,460
Let's search there.

1141
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:55,340
With the men we have,
we can finish quickly.

1142
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:57,260
He told us
he buried them here!

1143
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:59,540
That asshole is talking bullshit!

1144
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,300
You bastard.

1145
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:06,580
What's with you?
Is it because of the money?

1146
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:09,820
When will you get
your act straight?

1147
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:12,340
I don't believe this.

1148
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:15,500
Ji Young-min is on his way now.
Let's talk when he comes.

1149
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,860
Why do you move so slowly?

1150
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:20,100
I'm sorry, sir.

1151
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:21,460
Hey!

1152
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,380
I told you to cover his face.

1153
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,580
- Sorry, sir.
- Get the mask.

1154
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:27,180
Morons.

1155
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,460
Get moving!
Put him in the car!

1156
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:31,020
Yes, sir.

1157
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,380
Move your asses, will you?

1158
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:37,340
You seem busy.

1159
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:46,860
Ji Young-min, you should say hi
if you had seen me.

1160
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:52,700
Take off your cap.

1161
01:24:57,180 --> 01:24:59,100
Damn it, you ignorant cops.

1162
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:02,580
Have you lost your mind?

1163
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:08,980
Suspect of the Mapo murder case
was arrested.

1164
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:12,820
It's pitiful, isn't it?

1165
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:15,900
I understand.

1166
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:20,500
Shit splashes on the mayor's face.
You must be scared to death.

1167
01:25:20,660 --> 01:25:24,660
Set Young-min free this instant,
and bring your men back.

1168
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:27,820
How about we do this?
The DNA results will be out soon.

1169
01:25:27,940 --> 01:25:31,740
If people find out about this,
how would they react?

1170
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:35,740
A cop who got shit
on the mayor's face

1171
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:39,300
forced an innocent citizen
to be a serial killer to save face.

1172
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:43,820
But that citizen's face
was pulverized.

1173
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:49,860
Stop what you're doing and tell me
who did that to Young-min.

1174
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:51,700
Drag him down here now.

1175
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:53,420
I'll do everything
to get him fired.

1176
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:55,900
What the hell's wrong with you?

1177
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:57,460
- Jung-ho!
- Let go.

1178
01:25:57,580 --> 01:25:59,380
Jung-ho, come here!

1179
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:02,420
He's calling me, idiot!

1180
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:04,500
He's calling me, asshole.
You better watch it!

1181
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:11,340
You have to hurry and go.

1182
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:12,780
Where to?

1183
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:14,420
Stay still, asshole.

1184
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:15,540
Bastard.

1185
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:17,380
Hurry and catch him!

1186
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:20,940
Are you out of your minds?

1187
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:25,660
Why?

1188
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:26,700
What's with this?

1189
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:27,740
What?

1190
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,100
Jung-ho!

1191
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:30,140
What's going on?

1192
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:31,860
The chief said to bring you in!

1193
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,180
So why'd you hit him, idiot?

1194
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:37,420
Go away!
I'll chop you down!

1195
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:38,660
It's all over!

1196
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:40,780
We have to give up the case
and set Young-min free!

1197
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:43,060
Why? Are you crazy?

1198
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:45,580
We don't have any power!
The prosecutor told us to!

1199
01:26:45,820 --> 01:26:48,340
If he goes out,
what about Mi-jin?

1200
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:51,900
She's dead.
She died a long time ago!

1201
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:54,100
So put that down now!

1202
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:56,540
Why would she die,
you asshole?

1203
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:00,820
Grab that bastard!

1204
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:03,140
Catch him! Run faster!

1205
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:06,660
Over there!

1206
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:09,540
That way! Hurry!

1207
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:15,220
- Catch him!
- Run fast!

1208
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:17,980
Bastards!

1209
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:21,260
Catch him!

1210
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:25,460
Stay still, you bastard!

1211
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:26,740
- Make him not move!
- You sons of bitches!

1212
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:28,820
Hey! You sons of bitches!

1213
01:27:29,740 --> 01:27:31,540
Let go!

1214
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:36,620
Open the door!

1215
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:38,140
Get in!

1216
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:41,460
Get in there!

1217
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:10,620
Why didn't you just kill me
with the hoe?

1218
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:12,460
That's enough.

1219
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,300
Give me a cigarette.

1220
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:20,820
Ji-man, give me a cigarette.

1221
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,340
Damn it.

1222
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:24,260
Give it.

1223
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:32,500
Give me a lighter.

1224
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:38,180
Kyung-suk,
still working back door?

1225
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:43,140
Buy your mom some good food
after ripping off businesses?

1226
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:46,580
It's you who's made big money,
you bastard.

1227
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:49,380
Kyung-suk and l
made some money back then.

1228
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,700
Shit, but I was the
only one who got fired.

1229
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,380
Isn't that right?

1230
01:28:57,180 --> 01:29:01,180
Is your wallet full
from sucking that pig's ass?

1231
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:03,380
- Does your mother know that?
- What the...

1232
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:32,540
Give me the key.

1233
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:35,060
Hurry.

1234
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:38,220
Where's Ji Young-min?

1235
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:39,860
He's probably out now.

1236
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:42,140
Shit.

1237
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:25,980
Taxi! Taxi!

1238
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:33,020
Anybody here?

1239
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:35,220
Anybody here?

1240
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:36,500
Yes?

1241
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:39,180
- Oh, my goodness!
- Call the police!

1242
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:40,500
Hurry!

1243
01:33:41,940 --> 01:33:43,340
Ma'am.

1244
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:44,380
Ma'am!

1245
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:45,620
Yes.

1246
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:47,660
Oh, hello.

1247
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:49,100
- Cigarettes?
- Yes.

1248
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:54,260
What happened to your face?

1249
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:55,540
It was some lunatic.

1250
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:58,700
Why are there so many lunatics
in this neighborhood?

1251
01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:01,940
What's wrong?

1252
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:03,380
I'm scared to death.

1253
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:04,700
Stay with us for a while.

1254
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:06,060
- Why?
- Well,

1255
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:09,700
some lunatic locked up a girl
and tried to kill her.

1256
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:11,620
Is that so?

1257
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:15,100
Maybe it's the same guy
who hit you.

1258
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:17,460
Have a nice day.

1259
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:19,300
Just stay here a little longer!

1260
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:22,460
- Why?
- What if that lunatic comes here?

1261
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:24,860
Why would he come here?

1262
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:27,860
That girl is here.

1263
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:36,460
Just wait here
until the police arrive.

1264
01:34:36,580 --> 01:34:38,660
Help yourself to any drinks.

1265
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:45,580
What's taking the police
so long?

1266
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:50,460
When did you report it?

1267
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:52,100
It's been quite a while.

1268
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:03,140
Why aren't they coming?

1269
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:05,980
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

1270
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:09,060
Do you happen to have
a hammer or a club?

1271
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:10,300
Why?

1272
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:13,300
Well, I don't have a club.

1273
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:14,900
Here's a hammer.

1274
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:22,500
Seeing you stand there like that
makes me feel safe.

1275
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:34,900
Just stand there like that,

1276
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:38,780
and when that lunatic comes,
pound his face, okay?

1277
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:54,100
Hey.

1278
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:56,100
Wake up.

1279
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:57,340
Hey.

1280
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:03,500
You're really unbelievable.

1281
01:37:08,700 --> 01:37:10,140
How did you get out?

1282
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:13,580
How did you get out?

1283
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:23,700
Damn it.

1284
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:19,980
What happened?

1285
01:39:27,660 --> 01:39:29,820
Gil-woo! Gil-woo!

1286
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:31,380
Gil-woo! Gil-woo!

1287
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:37,980
Mi-jin!

1288
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:43,180
Mi-jin...

1289
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:50,380
Gil-woo... Gil-woo!

1290
01:39:51,460 --> 01:39:52,860
- You have to leave.
- Stop.

1291
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:54,180
Don't push!

1292
01:39:57,020 --> 01:39:58,100
Hey!

1293
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:02,540
Hey!

1294
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:06,460
Hey!

1295
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:08,580
Hey!

1296
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:10,780
Gil-woo!

1297
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:18,020
Look after the kid.

1298
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:52,740
He sent me
a strange text message.

1299
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:53,900
He covered his body
with blood.

1300
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:55,620
Hurry and tell me.

1301
01:41:55,740 --> 01:41:56,860
Right there.

1302
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:00,500
What about
the telecom company?

1303
01:42:00,940 --> 01:42:02,700
No judge's approval
on Sunday.

1304
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:04,700
Tell him to issue it
before I kill someone!

1305
01:42:04,860 --> 01:42:06,060
What bastard was it?

1306
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:08,260
Who spilled the beans?

1307
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:10,100
I told you to watch
your mouth!

1308
01:42:31,740 --> 01:42:33,300
Jung-ho.

1309
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:35,580
Jung-ho, it's me.

1310
01:42:36,580 --> 01:42:38,580
You're not answering
your phone.

1311
01:42:39,660 --> 01:42:41,740
Don't get mad and
listen to me.

1312
01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:46,060
I want to quit.

1313
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:50,180
I really can't take it.

1314
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:55,260
I'm too scared to do this job.

1315
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:50,900
Mangwon church

1316
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:15,540
Here doggie, doggie.

1317
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:18,580
Here you are.

1318
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:54,180
May I help you?

1319
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:03,980
Do you know him?

1320
01:45:27,700 --> 01:45:29,460
Mr. Park Dong-won.

1321
01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:31,580
He worked in construction.

1322
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:35,340
He helped to expand
the church recently.

1323
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:37,340
I saw him then.

1324
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:40,620
He made that cross.

1325
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:43,500
He's very talented.

1326
01:45:44,580 --> 01:45:47,500
PARK Dong-won
If you ask Mr. Park,
he may know him.

1327
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:06,500
Mangwon district, 24-1

1328
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:13,140
Where are you going?

1329
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:17,580
Let's go inside.

1330
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:08,820
Where is he?

1331
01:52:09,220 --> 01:52:10,340
Here!

1332
01:52:10,460 --> 01:52:11,580
Freeze!

1333
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:22,140
You bastard,
what are you doing?

1334
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:29,340
Jung-ho, put it down.

1335
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:37,500
Jung-ho, that's enough.
