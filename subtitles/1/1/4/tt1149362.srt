00:00:54,607 --> 00:01:10,236
THE WHITE RIBBON
A German children's story

2
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:07,997
<i>I don't know if the story
I want to tell you</i>

3
00:02:08,053 --> 00:02:10,030
<i>is entirely true.</i>

4
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:13,279
<i>Some of it I only know by hearsay.</i>

5
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:17,647
<i>After so many years,
a lot of it is still obscure,</i>

6
00:02:17,777 --> 00:02:20,740
<i>and many questions
remain unanswered.</i>

7
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,821
<i>But I think I must tell
of the strange events</i>

8
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:27,719
<i>that occurred in our village.</i>

9
00:02:27,954 --> 00:02:30,618
<i>They could perhaps</i>

10
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:33,960
<i>clarify some things
that happened in this country.</i>

11
00:02:34,478 --> 00:02:38,562
<i>It all began, I think,
with the doctor's riding accident.</i>

12
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:42,528
<i>After his dressage session
on the Baron's estate,</i>

13
00:02:42,827 --> 00:02:46,018
<i>he was headed home,</i>

14
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:49,296
<i>to see if any patients had arrived.</i>

15
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:51,811
<i>Entering the garden,</i>

16
00:02:52,143 --> 00:02:54,845
<i>his horse tripped on a wire</i>

17
00:02:54,863 --> 00:02:56,809
<i>strung between two trees.</i>

18
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:02,030
<i>His daughter saw the accident
from a window,</i>

19
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,592
<i>informed their neighbor,</i>

20
00:03:04,606 --> 00:03:06,740
<i>who informed the estate's steward,</i>

21
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,281
<i>so that the agonizing doctor</i>

22
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,354
<i>could be transported
to the district hospital</i>

23
00:03:12,355 --> 00:03:14,778
<i>over 30 km away.</i>

24
00:03:15,877 --> 00:03:19,514
<i>The neighbor,
a single woman of around 40,</i>

25
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,015
<i>was the village midwife.</i>

26
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:24,328
<i>Since the death of the doctor's wife
in childbirth,</i>

27
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:29,803
<i>she had become invaluable for him
as housekeeper and receptionist.</i>

28
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:33,145
<i>After tending the doctor's
two children,</i>

29
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:36,582
<i>she went to the school
to fetch her own son, Karl.</i>

30
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:39,147
- Have you seen Anni?
- You don't say hello?

31
00:03:39,741 --> 00:03:41,193
Hello, Mrs Wagner. Forgive him.

32
00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:42,362
Hi, Klara.

33
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:45,458
We're so worried
that Martin forgot his manners.

34
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:46,840
That's all right.

35
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:48,220
How is the Doctor?

36
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,534
Not very well.

37
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:51,703
- Must he stay in the hospital?
- I don't know.

38
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,155
We'll go see Anna, to help her out.

39
00:03:54,228 --> 00:03:55,264
Good!

40
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,863
- You enjoyed the choir?
- Yes.

41
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,920
Show how well you sang.

42
00:04:08,254 --> 00:04:09,801
Good bye, teacher.

43
00:04:14,582 --> 00:04:16,119
Last one is a rotten egg!

44
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,617
<i>If I remember correctly,</i>

45
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,562
<i>it seemed odd to me
that the kids around Klara,</i>

46
00:04:27,638 --> 00:04:31,501
<i>instead of scattering
after school to their homes,</i>

47
00:04:32,056 --> 00:04:36,063
<i>headed together
to the exit of the village.</i>

48
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,391
I could cut out some animals
for you,

49
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:41,553
like last week.

50
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,496
You'd like that?

51
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:56,584
We can color them together.

52
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:03,407
Or cut them
from the lovely colored paper?

53
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:06,969
The golden one
that I got for Easter?

54
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,969
Come on...

55
00:05:32,668 --> 00:05:35,517
Well, I'll make us something to eat.

56
00:05:35,762 --> 00:05:38,686
What if he never comes back?

57
00:05:40,276 --> 00:05:41,325
What?

58
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,141
Come on!

59
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,555
Don't be silly!

60
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:49,313
It'll heal, just like the flu.

61
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,718
Remember last winter?

62
00:05:56,683 --> 00:05:59,364
You were very sick, weren't you?

63
00:05:59,502 --> 00:06:00,624
And then...

64
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:44,414
Hi, Anni!

65
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,782
How are you?

66
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,507
Can we help you?

67
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:51,375
How did the wire get there?
Did the Doctor say?

68
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:53,552
He was in no mood to talk:

69
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:55,878
his collarbone
was stuck in his neck.

70
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:59,240
I asked his daughter.
She has no idea.

71
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:01,067
He rides through there daily.

72
00:07:01,243 --> 00:07:02,833
- Did you look at the wire?
- Sure.

73
00:07:02,903 --> 00:07:05,239
It's thin, but strong.

74
00:07:05,486 --> 00:07:07,186
Almost invisible.

75
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:29,925
Sorry, Madame.
You play too well for me.

76
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:33,692
Don't apologize, concentrate.
It'll help us both.

77
00:07:33,956 --> 00:07:38,055
You play too fast for me, M'am.
I'm not Frederic the Great.

78
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:40,180
How could he have played Schubert?

79
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:42,220
Let's do the Variation again.

80
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:06,157
Darling, if you like the music,
sit beside me and turn the pages.

81
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,721
If you're bored, go to your room.

82
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:10,533
Or stay out of my sight.

83
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:12,511
I get nervous if you saunter around.

84
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:18,648
What time is it?
Where's the nanny?

85
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,260
With the twins, I presume.

86
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:23,659
- It's twenty to nine.
- Twenty to nine?

87
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,494
Way past your bedtime!

88
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:27,329
Has he done his homework?

89
00:08:27,484 --> 00:08:28,720
Of course, M'am.

90
00:08:30,283 --> 00:08:32,783
You want to turn the pages for me or not?

91
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,149
Yes.

92
00:08:34,456 --> 00:08:35,828
Then come here!

93
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,770
Let's go back to the Theme.

94
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:42,085
Practice the Variations.
Or it's no fun.

95
00:08:42,695 --> 00:08:43,833
I'll do my best, Baroness.

96
00:08:44,308 --> 00:08:46,515
So from Bar 9.

97
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:58,537
Please forgive us, Father.

98
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,915
Forgive us.

99
00:09:06,414 --> 00:09:09,681
Tonight, no one here has eaten.

100
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:15,648
When night fell,
and you hadn't returned,

101
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:19,001
your mother searched the village
in tears.

102
00:09:21,454 --> 00:09:25,069
Could we have enjoyed our meal,
fearing for you?

103
00:09:26,892 --> 00:09:29,125
Can we enjoy our meal now,

104
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:31,856
after hearing your lying excuses?

105
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:35,367
I don't know what's worse:

106
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,739
your absence, or your coming back.

107
00:09:40,926 --> 00:09:43,465
Tonight we'll all go to bed hungry.

108
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,544
You surely agree with me

109
00:09:54,616 --> 00:09:57,305
that I can't leave
your offense unpunished

110
00:09:57,647 --> 00:10:00,794
if we want to keep on living
in mutual respect.

111
00:10:02,763 --> 00:10:05,393
So tomorrow evening at this hour,

112
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:08,203
I'll give each of you,
in front of your siblings,

113
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:10,376
ten strokes of the cane.

114
00:10:11,573 --> 00:10:14,742
Until then,
you may ponder over your offense.

115
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:18,252
Do you agree with me?

116
00:10:18,847 --> 00:10:20,081
Yes, Father.

117
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:24,942
All right then.
Go to bed now, all of you.

118
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,754
Don't touch me!

119
00:10:50,237 --> 00:10:53,437
Your mother and I will sleep poorly:

120
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,960
I have to beat you and the strokes
will cause us more pain than you.

121
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,909
Leave us alone, and go to bed!

122
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:08,222
When you were little,

123
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:11,494
your mother sometimes tied a ribbon

124
00:11:11,495 --> 00:11:13,495
in your hair or around your arm.

125
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:17,650
Its white color was to remind you
of innocence and purity.

126
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:24,126
I thought you were now
well-mannered enough

127
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:26,722
to get by without such reminders.

128
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:31,112
I was wrong.

129
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:36,538
Tomorrow, once your punishment
has purified you,

130
00:11:36,784 --> 00:11:38,916
your mother
will re-tie a ribbon on you,

131
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:40,859
and you'll wear it

132
00:11:41,322 --> 00:11:45,033
until we can trust you again.

133
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:48,598
Where is the wire now?

134
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:52,837
Who removed it?

135
00:11:52,906 --> 00:11:53,996
I don't know.

136
00:11:54,031 --> 00:11:55,422
You weren't here?

137
00:11:58,415 --> 00:12:00,192
You were in town with your father?

138
00:12:00,227 --> 00:12:01,306
No.

139
00:12:01,457 --> 00:12:03,661
- Then you were here.
- I was at school.

140
00:12:03,735 --> 00:12:06,188
When you left,
was the wire still here?

141
00:12:06,231 --> 00:12:07,574
I didn't check.

142
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,878
- When did you get back?
- At noon.

143
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:13,884
I make lunch for the Doctor
and the kids.

144
00:12:13,911 --> 00:12:16,521
I've helped him since his wife died.

145
00:12:16,523 --> 00:12:17,722
Since when?

146
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:20,440
Since Rudolf's birth, 5 years ago.

147
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:22,835
I'm the midwife here.
We work together.

148
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:24,863
- But you saw nothing?
- No.

149
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,552
How long was the wire there?

150
00:12:27,553 --> 00:12:28,941
I never saw it.

151
00:12:30,002 --> 00:12:32,817
Nobody saw it before, or afterwards!

152
00:12:33,072 --> 00:12:36,704
It wound itself around two trees,
and vanished by itself!

153
00:12:37,797 --> 00:12:39,047
Right?

154
00:12:39,064 --> 00:12:40,189
Mom!

155
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,594
What is it ?

156
00:12:46,627 --> 00:12:47,728
Excuse me.

157
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,160
<i>The day after the doctor's accident</i>

158
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:53,585
<i>brought no solution to the mystery.</i>

159
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:56,933
<i>Then a second,
far more tragic incident,</i>

160
00:12:57,566 --> 00:13:00,533
<i>almost made people forget
the previous one.</i>

161
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:05,720
<i>The wife of a tenant farmer
died in a work-accident.</i>

162
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:10,284
<i>The woman, who had an injured arm,</i>

163
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:14,410
<i>was dispensed by the steward
from harvesting chores,</i>

164
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:19,504
<i>and assigned to lighter work
in the sawmill.</i>

165
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:29,283
Stay outside! I'm not done.

166
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:31,206
You get out!

167
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:05,216
<i>On the same day,
I had a strange encounter.</i>

168
00:15:05,492 --> 00:15:07,929
<i>The weather was beautiful and hot,</i>

169
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:12,838
<i>so I decided to improve my meager
menu with some brown trout,</i>

170
00:15:12,938 --> 00:15:15,715
<i>which are plentiful in the river.</i>

171
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:20,045
<i>The Baron allowed me to fish there.</i>

172
00:15:23,052 --> 00:15:24,135
Martin!

173
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,428
Martin, be careful!

174
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:43,837
Are you insane?

175
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:45,429
You want to break your neck?

176
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,685
Hello, sir.

177
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:49,405
What's this?
Have you gone mad?

178
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:51,740
You know how high that is?

179
00:15:53,212 --> 00:15:55,054
Didn't you hear me shout to you?

180
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:56,425
Yes, I did.

181
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:57,653
Well?

182
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:01,525
Well?

183
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,992
You saw me and wanted to impress me?

184
00:16:09,495 --> 00:16:10,517
So why...

185
00:16:10,518 --> 00:16:13,211
I gave God a chance to kill me.

186
00:16:14,297 --> 00:16:17,700
He didn't do it.
So he's pleased with me.

187
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:19,208
What are you saying?

188
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,951
He doesn't want me to die.

189
00:16:22,334 --> 00:16:24,525
Who doesn't want you to die?

190
00:16:25,378 --> 00:16:26,384
God.

191
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:31,492
Why would God want you to die?

192
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,342
Promise me you won't do it again!

193
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:44,567
Look at me!

194
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,711
Promise it!

195
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:52,700
You don't trust me, huh?

196
00:16:53,044 --> 00:16:54,310
Yes, I do, sir.

197
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:57,999
All right.

198
00:16:58,592 --> 00:17:02,149
Go home. Tomorrow after your
piano lesson, I'll talk to your dad.

199
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:04,922
No, please, don't tell him!

200
00:17:07,508 --> 00:17:08,640
It's there.

201
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:15,138
Careful, it's all rotten.

202
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,829
Who sent her up here?

203
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,226
No idea.

204
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:32,890
We had to collect loose ends.
She fell through.

205
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:35,741
You saw it?

206
00:17:35,756 --> 00:17:37,060
Not really.

207
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:41,757
You know how it works.

208
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,805
The foremen assign
weaker harvesters up here.

209
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:49,266
Who assigned her?

210
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:54,766
<i>On my way home, after
that strange encounter with Martin,</i>

211
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,182
<i>was when I first met Eva...</i>

212
00:17:58,943 --> 00:18:00,010
Hello!

213
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,839
Excuse me!

214
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:06,885
Sorry for accosting you.

215
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:09,607
Aren't you the new nanny
on the estate?

216
00:18:10,497 --> 00:18:11,667
Why?

217
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,944
They say you're from Treglitz.

218
00:18:15,815 --> 00:18:17,076
Who says that?

219
00:18:17,301 --> 00:18:18,586
The locals.

220
00:18:21,242 --> 00:18:22,393
So?

221
00:18:23,413 --> 00:18:24,465
Nothing...

222
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,217
I don't know...

223
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,243
I'm the schoolteacher here.

224
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:31,071
I just thought...

225
00:18:32,804 --> 00:18:34,991
When I saw you, I thought...

226
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:38,352
I'm the tailor's son from Vasendorf.

227
00:18:38,502 --> 00:18:39,773
- I know.
- What?

228
00:18:40,158 --> 00:18:41,470
The Baroness told me.

229
00:18:41,762 --> 00:18:42,768
What?

230
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,703
That the teacher is
from the village next to mine.

231
00:18:45,785 --> 00:18:46,917
I see, yes...

232
00:18:47,736 --> 00:18:48,942
Well... I thought...

233
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,087
Looks as if you're going there...

234
00:18:52,718 --> 00:18:53,762
Where?

235
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:55,181
Back home. To Treglitz.

236
00:18:55,972 --> 00:18:57,112
Yes?

237
00:18:57,332 --> 00:18:58,641
- Are you going there?
- Yes, I am.

238
00:19:00,341 --> 00:19:01,593
I thought...

239
00:19:02,573 --> 00:19:06,681
since you'll go through our village,
you could...

240
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:10,619
say hello to my dad,
and give him a fish?

241
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,083
What?

242
00:19:13,473 --> 00:19:15,025
He'd love that.

243
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:17,681
Especially over the weekend.

244
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,942
How...?

245
00:19:24,307 --> 00:19:25,486
I don't know.

246
00:19:25,577 --> 00:19:27,655
Unfortunately,
I have nothing to wrap...

247
00:19:31,006 --> 00:19:32,265
Neither do I.

248
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:34,526
Unfortunately...

249
00:19:34,686 --> 00:19:37,577
We could tie them on
with fishing line.

250
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,992
Just like that, on the bike?

251
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,054
That's not a very good idea.

252
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:45,400
Right, it was just an idea.

253
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:46,830
Yes.

254
00:19:54,884 --> 00:19:56,098
Is it your bike?

255
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:58,904
No, the estate's.

256
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:04,543
Is this your first day off?

257
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,856
You must be glad to go home.

258
00:20:10,824 --> 00:20:12,192
I can imagine.

259
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:19,942
Well... I've still a long way to go.

260
00:20:21,992 --> 00:20:23,068
Well...

261
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,426
Good-bye.

262
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,327
Good-bye.

263
00:20:26,803 --> 00:20:28,669
If you see my father in Vasendorf,

264
00:20:28,704 --> 00:20:30,701
say hello to him from me.

265
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:33,682
I don't know your father.

266
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,178
That's true.

267
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:45,150
It's my first time on a bike!

268
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:46,558
You're doing fine!

269
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,232
But be careful!

270
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:08,523
The woman today,
what was wrong with her?

271
00:21:08,572 --> 00:21:09,658
Which woman?

272
00:21:12,118 --> 00:21:13,574
I see. She was dead.

273
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:18,608
What's that?

274
00:21:18,756 --> 00:21:19,771
What?

275
00:21:21,134 --> 00:21:22,161
Dead.

276
00:21:23,425 --> 00:21:24,652
What's "dead"?

277
00:21:25,308 --> 00:21:27,399
Quite a question!

278
00:21:27,972 --> 00:21:30,307
It's when one doesn't live anymore.

279
00:21:30,577 --> 00:21:32,098
When one has stopped living.

280
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,540
When does one stop living?

281
00:21:36,736 --> 00:21:39,558
When one is very old, or very ill.

282
00:21:40,753 --> 00:21:42,043
And the woman?

283
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:44,838
She had an accident.

284
00:21:45,363 --> 00:21:46,568
An "accident"?

285
00:21:46,768 --> 00:21:49,577
Yes. It's when you're badly hurt.

286
00:21:50,153 --> 00:21:51,213
Like Dad?

287
00:21:51,995 --> 00:21:54,246
Yes, but much worse than that.

288
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,299
So bad,
your body can't take it anymore.

289
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,358
And then you're dead ?

290
00:22:02,464 --> 00:22:03,546
Yes.

291
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:07,650
But most people
don't have an accident.

292
00:22:08,383 --> 00:22:11,584
- So they're not dead.
- No, they die much later.

293
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,027
When?

294
00:22:14,154 --> 00:22:17,377
Well... later,
when they're really old.

295
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:22,952
Does everyone die?

296
00:22:23,983 --> 00:22:25,070
Yes.

297
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,291
Everyone, really?

298
00:22:28,602 --> 00:22:30,996
Yes, everyone has to die.

299
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:33,620
But not you, Anni?

300
00:22:34,968 --> 00:22:36,137
Me too.

301
00:22:36,213 --> 00:22:37,373
Everyone.

302
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:40,544
But not Dad?

303
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:42,528
Dad too.

304
00:22:43,468 --> 00:22:44,637
Me too?

305
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,729
You too.
But not for a very long time.

306
00:22:49,182 --> 00:22:50,733
All of us, only in a very long time.

307
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:55,612
One can't fight it?
It has to happen?

308
00:22:56,696 --> 00:22:59,004
Yes, but not for a very long time.

309
00:23:02,462 --> 00:23:03,712
And Mom?

310
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,923
She didn't go on a trip?

311
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,952
Is she dead too?

312
00:23:13,797 --> 00:23:14,811
Yes.

313
00:23:15,453 --> 00:23:16,920
She's dead too.

314
00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:19,887
But that was a long time ago.

315
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:18,381
Klara!

316
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:31,577
Martin, you coming?

317
00:28:00,406 --> 00:28:01,506
Karli?

318
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:38,522
You can come in.

319
00:28:38,893 --> 00:28:40,085
What is it?

320
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,030
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

321
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:43,435
It's a boy.

322
00:28:44,738 --> 00:28:47,232
What? Don't you want a brother?

323
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:50,269
Lucky your father didn't hear you.

324
00:28:56,497 --> 00:28:57,694
I'm sorry.

325
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:01,072
They knew it was dangerous for her.

326
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:02,481
What do you want?

327
00:29:02,822 --> 00:29:04,291
You want to sue the Baron?

328
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:07,043
Or murder the steward?

329
00:29:07,355 --> 00:29:09,435
Go cut off his head
with your scythe!

330
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:12,666
Won't bring your mother
back to life.

331
00:29:19,386 --> 00:29:21,051
Father, you loved our mother.

332
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:22,556
Shut up!

333
00:29:25,193 --> 00:29:27,481
<i>After those two days in July,</i>

334
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:30,792
<i>life in the village
got back to normal.</i>

335
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,941
<i>The daily harvesting chores
exhausted everyone.</i>

336
00:29:35,326 --> 00:29:39,044
<i>Most of the kids pitched in
to help their parents.</i>

337
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:43,032
<i>I took up the steward's offer</i>

338
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:46,886
<i>to be his secretary
during the harvesting,</i>

339
00:29:47,093 --> 00:29:50,072
<i>as I hoped it would enable me</i>

340
00:29:50,107 --> 00:29:52,355
<i>to see the young girl again.</i>

341
00:29:52,455 --> 00:29:56,460
<i>I couldn't get her out of my mind
after our meeting.</i>

342
00:29:57,113 --> 00:30:00,698
<i>But she rarely came out
of the manor house.</i>

343
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:05,751
<i>The doctor was still
in the hospital.</i>

344
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,027
<i>Anna and Rudolf, his two children,</i>

345
00:30:08,215 --> 00:30:11,465
<i>were cared for meanwhile
by the midwife.</i>

346
00:30:11,954 --> 00:30:14,156
<i>After the farmer's wife's funeral,</i>

347
00:30:14,256 --> 00:30:16,471
<i>that the whole village attended,</i>

348
00:30:16,784 --> 00:30:19,732
<i>both accidents were forgotten.</i>

349
00:30:20,144 --> 00:30:22,261
<i>Until the end of the summer</i>

350
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:25,822
<i>when the harvest feast
reunited the whole village,</i>

351
00:30:26,043 --> 00:30:27,856
<i>first in a joyful mood,</i>

352
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:31,168
<i>then in horror and perplexity.</i>

353
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,502
My thanks to all of you.

354
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:42,105
You have worked well.

355
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:45,638
The heavens were kind
and the barns are full.

356
00:30:46,213 --> 00:30:47,883
So the beer can flow,

357
00:30:48,171 --> 00:30:49,936
and you won't starve today!

358
00:30:50,213 --> 00:30:52,464
Long live the Baron!

359
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:53,719
Long may he live!

360
00:30:59,873 --> 00:31:01,373
Most honorable Baron

361
00:31:02,213 --> 00:31:03,372
and Baroness,

362
00:31:04,034 --> 00:31:05,092
dear merrymakers...

363
00:31:06,345 --> 00:31:08,482
Let us hear on this festive occasion

364
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:12,281
Psalm 145, Verse 15:

365
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:15,667
"The eyes of all wait upon thee, Lord;

366
00:31:16,098 --> 00:31:19,747
"and thou givest them their meat
in due season...."

367
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:22,104
In the name of the Father,

368
00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:23,857
the Son,

369
00:31:24,595 --> 00:31:26,369
and the Holy Ghost.

370
00:31:26,755 --> 00:31:27,767
Amen.

371
00:31:29,982 --> 00:31:31,918
Now enjoy your meal.

372
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,254
Eat and drink to your fill!
You earned it!

373
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:24,547
You promised us
a chorale by your pupils.

374
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,834
Ask the pastor, Baroness.

375
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,587
We're still practicing
for the confirmation feast.

376
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,303
That's in spring!
Now it's the fall.

377
00:32:33,546 --> 00:32:37,635
Our little singers aren't all
very musical. Sorry!

378
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,870
Well, you two "mothers"?

379
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:54,525
Not taking part in the festivities?

380
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,902
It's so nice here in the shade.

381
00:32:57,636 --> 00:32:59,952
Our son seems to be enjoying that!

382
00:32:59,953 --> 00:33:00,953
Yes.

383
00:33:01,768 --> 00:33:03,089
I can imagine.

384
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:05,331
Who wouldn't like it.

385
00:33:05,574 --> 00:33:06,811
Georg!

386
00:33:08,938 --> 00:33:10,124
What about yout?

387
00:33:10,691 --> 00:33:13,917
Aren't you bored
caring for other's children,

388
00:33:14,317 --> 00:33:16,600
with all the young lads over there?

389
00:33:17,403 --> 00:33:20,669
No, sir.
I like being with the children.

390
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:25,639
How old are you anyway?

391
00:33:25,858 --> 00:33:27,012
17, sir.

392
00:33:27,112 --> 00:33:28,113
17!

393
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,479
Wouldn't you rather hold a suitor

394
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:34,533
than the Baroness's kids?

395
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:37,754
- Leave her alone, George!
- What did I do?

396
00:33:39,135 --> 00:33:41,912
Won't you get us
something to eat, Emma?

397
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:45,685
If you'll mind
the children a moment, I'll go.

398
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:25,672
He was drunk,
but they couldn't stop him.

399
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:43,413
Leave Frieda alone!

400
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:48,744
Shove it!

401
00:34:51,018 --> 00:34:53,469
...I'm the rooster on the tower...

402
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:56,123
Someone cut off
the Baron's cabbages.

403
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:57,410
What?

404
00:34:57,568 --> 00:34:59,898
Someone cut off
the Baron's cabbages!

405
00:35:07,248 --> 00:35:09,732
- I never learned.
- Neither did I .

406
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,624
You have to count out loud.

407
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:14,239
One, two, three.

408
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,596
Your pupils will laugh
when they see us dancing, sir!

409
00:35:25,597 --> 00:35:27,593
They'd better not!

410
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,542
And stop being so formal with me.
Am I so old?

411
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,359
It's coming along!

412
00:35:36,616 --> 00:35:37,656
Well...

413
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,050
Don't look at your feet.

414
00:35:50,324 --> 00:35:52,373
Quite a job, huh?

415
00:35:54,758 --> 00:35:56,199
It's disgusting!

416
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,145
It was an old custom:
"Harvest's done, pay everyone,

417
00:36:00,474 --> 00:36:03,885
"If we don't get our due,
your cabbage'll be sliced for you."

418
00:36:04,142 --> 00:36:06,694
Well, they sure slurped down enough!

419
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:44,258
Come in.

420
00:36:51,779 --> 00:36:53,038
What do you want?

421
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,156
A favor, Father.

422
00:36:57,894 --> 00:36:59,013
Yes?

423
00:37:08,475 --> 00:37:09,477
Yes?

424
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,817
I found it.
It's wounded.

425
00:37:14,118 --> 00:37:15,274
And?

426
00:37:15,502 --> 00:37:17,335
May I keep it?

427
00:37:20,891 --> 00:37:22,591
How will you go about that?

428
00:37:23,193 --> 00:37:24,977
We'll heal it.

429
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,750
And when it's healed?

430
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:34,338
Won't you be attached to it then?

431
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,362
Will you let it fly away?

432
00:37:39,942 --> 00:37:42,169
Piepsi still lives in a cage.

433
00:37:42,669 --> 00:37:45,906
Yes, but it grew up in captivity.

434
00:37:46,312 --> 00:37:47,941
This one is used to freedom.

435
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:51,069
Will you set it free,
once it's healed?

436
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:55,899
Have you asked Mother?

437
00:37:55,999 --> 00:37:57,061
Yes.

438
00:37:57,616 --> 00:37:58,896
What did she say?

439
00:37:59,226 --> 00:38:01,749
That it was for you to decide,
Father.

440
00:38:02,682 --> 00:38:03,846
Really?

441
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,677
That's what she said.

442
00:38:07,571 --> 00:38:09,769
You'll really take care of it?

443
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,427
Yes.

444
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:16,051
You realize that's
a heavy responsibility?

445
00:38:17,932 --> 00:38:20,279
You'll be its father and mother.

446
00:38:25,338 --> 00:38:29,156
We'll have to find a cage
for your patient.

447
00:38:29,505 --> 00:38:31,902
Did you do it, or didn't you?

448
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:35,217
- Seems somebody saw you.
- So what?

449
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,496
They're lucky
they still have their heads!

450
00:38:38,885 --> 00:38:41,768
I have to tell you, Father:
I'm proud of it!

451
00:38:43,092 --> 00:38:44,390
Sit down!

452
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:52,581
What did you intend to do?

453
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,237
Tell me.

454
00:38:57,855 --> 00:38:59,166
Come on. Tell me.

455
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,316
You know why, Father.

456
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:04,867
Because of your mother?

457
00:39:05,628 --> 00:39:08,192
You think they caused her death?

458
00:39:09,032 --> 00:39:10,182
You think that?

459
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:13,879
That I'm not man enough
to settle it?

460
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:32,849
Know what your act
may do for us all?

461
00:39:33,299 --> 00:39:34,821
If Frieda loses her job,

462
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,447
which keeps us alive
for a whole year?

463
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:40,167
If we can't work here
in the summer?

464
00:39:44,814 --> 00:39:47,854
You want to marry
and run the farm in two years?

465
00:39:48,417 --> 00:39:52,234
You'll feed everyone
without the help of the estate?

466
00:39:56,241 --> 00:39:58,409
How do you know they're responsible?

467
00:39:59,877 --> 00:40:01,418
How do you know they're innocent?

468
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:04,747
I don't know.

469
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:08,342
But I also don't know the opposite!

470
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,473
What do you mean "not there"?

471
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,799
He's disappeared.
I looked all over.

472
00:40:13,114 --> 00:40:16,640
He hasn't disappeared.
When did you last see him?

473
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,090
Around 2 o'clock.

474
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:19,280
Around 2?

475
00:40:20,421 --> 00:40:23,021
- You know what time it is?
- I know, Baron.

476
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:27,236
What does my wife say?

477
00:40:27,449 --> 00:40:29,849
She sent me to you. She's terrified.

478
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:32,828
I can imagine.
You're an idiot, Huber.

479
00:40:33,448 --> 00:40:35,372
Why do you think you're here?

480
00:40:35,927 --> 00:40:39,306
To take care of one child!
Is that so hard?

481
00:40:39,588 --> 00:40:41,250
I'm so sorry, Baron.

482
00:40:41,494 --> 00:40:42,951
You can shove your excuses!

483
00:40:46,555 --> 00:40:48,143
Where did you last see my son?

484
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:51,301
Here. He left to play
with the other kids.

485
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,111
- Where?
- He didn't say.

486
00:40:53,372 --> 00:40:55,563
My wife noticed nothing either?

487
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,747
The cabbage heads affair upset her.

488
00:40:57,748 --> 00:40:59,686
She retired, indisposed.

489
00:41:00,011 --> 00:41:01,511
Indisposed?

490
00:41:01,685 --> 00:41:03,952
Yes, a terrible migraine attack.

491
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:07,160
This is a madhouse!

492
00:41:08,006 --> 00:41:09,299
Have you seen my son?

493
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,462
No.

494
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,199
Ask your sons. Sigi has disappeared
with some other kids.

495
00:41:14,449 --> 00:41:17,345
- What does it mean?
- That he's disappeared, dammit!

496
00:41:17,674 --> 00:41:20,257
<i>The steward's kids said
they'd only seen Sigi</i>

497
00:41:20,542 --> 00:41:21,642
<i>very briefly,</i>

498
00:41:22,057 --> 00:41:23,825
<i>that he'd gone off with other kids.</i>

499
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,066
<i>They didn't pay
much attention to it.</i>

500
00:41:27,309 --> 00:41:29,852
<i>The search began
shortly after midnight.</i>

501
00:41:30,106 --> 00:41:33,925
<i>The searchers, tired,
some still drunk,</i>

502
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:35,703
<i>were divided into two groups:</i>

503
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:40,380
<i>one searched
all the estate's buildings,</i>

504
00:41:41,258 --> 00:41:43,866
<i>the other combed the countryside.</i>

505
00:41:44,561 --> 00:41:47,753
<i>Around 2.30 AM,
the siren sounded again</i>

506
00:41:47,754 --> 00:41:50,439
<i>calling the men back to the estate.</i>

507
00:41:51,049 --> 00:41:52,971
<i>Sigi had been found.</i>

508
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:58,705
<i>He was in the sawmill,
tied upside down.</i>

509
00:41:59,362 --> 00:42:01,237
<i>His trousers were pulled down,</i>

510
00:42:01,238 --> 00:42:04,214
<i>his buttocks
bleeding from cane strokes.</i>

511
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:08,507
<i>He was in a state of shock,
unable to walk.</i>

512
00:42:08,508 --> 00:42:10,301
<i>Lying on his belly,</i>

513
00:42:10,302 --> 00:42:14,195
<i>he was carried home
on a makeshift stretcher.</i>

514
00:42:15,331 --> 00:42:19,542
<i>Next Sunday, after the service,
the Baron asked the pastor</i>

515
00:42:19,543 --> 00:42:21,581
<i>to let him speak.</i>

516
00:42:21,904 --> 00:42:26,157
City policemen questioned
many of you this week.

517
00:42:26,722 --> 00:42:28,122
To no avail.

518
00:42:29,734 --> 00:42:32,735
First I thought
my child was tortured

519
00:42:32,736 --> 00:42:37,989
by those who cut off my cabbages.

520
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:40,111
To get even!

521
00:42:40,789 --> 00:42:41,958
For what?

522
00:42:43,421 --> 00:42:46,791
Supposedly it was my fault
their mother died in the sawmill,

523
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:50,354
which is absurd.

524
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:52,930
At least, young Felder

525
00:42:52,931 --> 00:42:57,553
told the police that was his motive
for his "mowing prowess".

526
00:42:59,269 --> 00:43:01,830
I've always helped
the Felder family.

527
00:43:02,824 --> 00:43:04,895
But people aren't always grateful.

528
00:43:05,378 --> 00:43:07,178
It takes character.

529
00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:10,631
Don't run away, Felder!

530
00:43:10,845 --> 00:43:12,909
It's your honor I want to salvage!

531
00:43:14,623 --> 00:43:18,570
It turns out
the "valiant" Max Felder

532
00:43:19,213 --> 00:43:23,731
boasted of his feat to his fiancée.
Then the coward

533
00:43:23,732 --> 00:43:25,669
hid among his family,

534
00:43:27,043 --> 00:43:30,152
so he didn't have time
to torture my son.

535
00:43:30,353 --> 00:43:33,672
As to his father,
he'd bite off his tongue

536
00:43:33,673 --> 00:43:36,821
rather than cover
for his wayward son.

537
00:43:41,295 --> 00:43:45,672
I'll remind you of a fact
that most of you may have forgotten.

538
00:43:46,952 --> 00:43:50,558
Two months ago, our doctor
had a riding accident,

539
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:53,888
and is still not back from the hospital.

540
00:43:54,581 --> 00:43:56,225
This accident was caused

541
00:43:56,226 --> 00:43:58,819
by a wire strung in his garden,

542
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:02,283
with the explicit intent
of bringing him down.

543
00:44:04,448 --> 00:44:07,039
There, too, nobody knows,

544
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,136
saw or heard anything.

545
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:15,505
We all know it:
those who injured my son,

546
00:44:15,506 --> 00:44:17,894
and the doctor,

547
00:44:17,895 --> 00:44:18,978
are here

548
00:44:18,979 --> 00:44:20,801
among us,

549
00:44:20,802 --> 00:44:22,486
in this room.

550
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,750
I won't let such crimes
go unpunished,

551
00:44:27,594 --> 00:44:28,968
and hope nothing like that

552
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:31,427
happens to any of your children.

553
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:35,498
That's why I call upon you all:

554
00:44:36,322 --> 00:44:39,543
help me find the culprit
or the culprits!

555
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,146
If we fail to find out the truth,

556
00:44:43,632 --> 00:44:46,042
the peace of our community
will be gone.

557
00:44:47,066 --> 00:44:50,318
<i>The landowner's speech
frightened the locals.</i>

558
00:44:50,964 --> 00:44:52,594
<i>The Baron wasn't popular,</i>

559
00:44:52,595 --> 00:44:57,666
<i>but as a powerful figure
and employer of half the village,</i>

560
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:59,305
<i>he was respected.</i>

561
00:44:59,803 --> 00:45:02,262
<i>His statement
on the community's peace</i>

562
00:45:02,263 --> 00:45:04,764
<i>was ominous.</i>

563
00:45:04,765 --> 00:45:09,483
<i>And the mysterious character
of these criminal deeds</i>

564
00:45:09,737 --> 00:45:13,129
<i>awakened the old mistrust
of the farmers.</i>

565
00:45:28,303 --> 00:45:29,303
Come in!

566
00:45:36,229 --> 00:45:37,259
Eva!

567
00:45:39,215 --> 00:45:40,365
May I come in?

568
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:43,791
What a question!
Of course, come in.

569
00:45:45,505 --> 00:45:46,599
What's it about?

570
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,282
What's wrong?

571
00:45:53,403 --> 00:45:55,165
They fired me.

572
00:45:56,558 --> 00:45:57,560
What do you mean?

573
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,149
Nothing. They just fired me.

574
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:04,782
The tutor was also fired.

575
00:46:19,674 --> 00:46:22,012
I don't know where to go.

576
00:46:23,436 --> 00:46:25,241
I'm afraid on the road alone.

577
00:46:25,242 --> 00:46:27,426
Don't worry. Calm down.

578
00:46:27,427 --> 00:46:29,824
Come, sit here.

579
00:46:30,982 --> 00:46:33,264
Calm down, tell me what happened.

580
00:46:37,621 --> 00:46:38,667
Well?

581
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:41,563
What happened?

582
00:46:45,426 --> 00:46:48,206
The Baron's son isn't at all well.

583
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:52,434
His parents are desperate and angry.

584
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:56,314
Now they say
the tutor and I are to blame,

585
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,985
because we didn't pay
enough attention to him.

586
00:47:00,086 --> 00:47:02,372
But I'm only there for the twins.

587
00:47:05,144 --> 00:47:07,824
I've always taken care of them
very well.

588
00:47:08,783 --> 00:47:10,242
When you and I were dancing,

589
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:13,546
the Baroness
had given me permission.

590
00:47:14,735 --> 00:47:16,387
I haven't done anything wrong.

591
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,969
I know, come on. Stop crying!

592
00:47:23,278 --> 00:47:24,894
Where can I go now?

593
00:47:25,779 --> 00:47:27,915
My family needs my earnings.

594
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,081
You'll find something else.

595
00:47:30,082 --> 00:47:32,716
You know,
the Baron is quick-tempered.

596
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,203
But his bark is worse than his bite.

597
00:47:35,238 --> 00:47:38,324
No, it's all over now, I know it.

598
00:47:39,592 --> 00:47:41,662
The Baroness doesn't want
to see anyone.

599
00:47:42,649 --> 00:47:45,329
She wants to take the kids
with her, to town,

600
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:48,112
or to her parents' estate.

601
00:47:49,891 --> 00:47:51,378
I'll try to talk to her.

602
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:55,719
We used to play piano together,
four-handed.

603
00:47:56,243 --> 00:47:57,943
But I wasn't very good.

604
00:47:58,388 --> 00:48:02,006
Now she's the tutor,
who studied the flute in town.

605
00:48:04,653 --> 00:48:06,683
He doesn't play that well.

606
00:48:07,001 --> 00:48:08,158
That's true.

607
00:48:17,831 --> 00:48:19,449
Who does things like that?

608
00:48:20,351 --> 00:48:21,538
What?

609
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,847
Beating a child like that.

610
00:48:25,042 --> 00:48:26,170
I don't know.

611
00:48:33,261 --> 00:48:35,346
Can I stay here tonight?

612
00:48:36,727 --> 00:48:39,272
Don't send me away, sir, please.

613
00:48:39,734 --> 00:48:41,173
How could you think that?

614
00:48:42,407 --> 00:48:46,016
I'll just wait for daybreak,
here in the classroom.

615
00:48:46,338 --> 00:48:48,037
Then I'll leave.

616
00:48:51,744 --> 00:48:54,349
At home, they won't understand this.

617
00:48:56,598 --> 00:48:58,806
They'll think I did something wrong.

618
00:49:00,858 --> 00:49:02,401
Want me to come with you?

619
00:49:02,698 --> 00:49:03,723
What?

620
00:49:03,889 --> 00:49:05,489
Tomorrow, after school?

621
00:49:05,746 --> 00:49:08,409
I'll find a carriage,
I'll be back by evening.

622
00:49:10,386 --> 00:49:12,140
Why would you do that, sir?

623
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:15,096
Stop being so formal.

624
00:49:18,279 --> 00:49:20,460
Why would you do that?

625
00:49:22,173 --> 00:49:24,254
Come here,
I'll play something for you.

626
00:49:25,303 --> 00:49:26,467
If you want.

627
00:50:34,608 --> 00:50:35,929
Good morning, Father.

628
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:49,942
I'm back again.

629
00:50:50,544 --> 00:50:51,582
They set me free.

630
00:50:51,836 --> 00:50:53,461
I can see that. So what?

631
00:51:12,204 --> 00:51:13,997
Can you forgive me, Father?

632
00:51:17,228 --> 00:51:18,806
Forgive you for what?

633
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:21,785
That the estate
won't give me any work?

634
00:51:22,354 --> 00:51:25,264
That Frieda was fired in disgrace?

635
00:51:25,568 --> 00:51:28,066
That your brothers and sisters
have nothing to eat?

636
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,491
Or what?

637
00:51:31,035 --> 00:51:34,431
<i>The next day, after school,
I went to the estate</i>

638
00:51:34,713 --> 00:51:37,344
<i>to inquire about Sigi's health</i>

639
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:41,019
<i>and to intercede
for Eva's reinstatement.</i>

640
00:51:41,263 --> 00:51:42,337
<i>I was told</i>

641
00:51:42,565 --> 00:51:45,827
<i>the Baroness had left that morning
with her children.</i>

642
00:51:47,472 --> 00:51:51,958
<i>Reluctantly, the steward
lent me a carriage to take Eva home.</i>

643
00:51:52,548 --> 00:51:56,194
<i>As we left the village,
we crossed the doctor.</i>

644
00:51:56,714 --> 00:51:58,843
<i>A few days
after the Thanksgiving feast,</i>

645
00:51:58,901 --> 00:52:02,934
<i>Rudolf, his four-year-old son,
had suddenly disappeared.</i>

646
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,486
<i>This upset everyone
in view of the previous events.</i>

647
00:52:08,073 --> 00:52:10,840
<i>The boy was finally found
on the main road,</i>

648
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:13,217
<i>scantily dressed for a trip,</i>

649
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:16,375
<i>walking eagerly toward the town.</i>

650
00:52:16,376 --> 00:52:18,707
<i>When asked where he was going,</i>

651
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:21,477
<i>he said he wanted
to visit his father.</i>

652
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:26,309
<i>He fought tooth and nail
against being taken home.</i>

653
00:52:27,403 --> 00:52:29,864
<i>The doctor was told about this</i>

654
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:33,747
<i>and, due to be released soon anyway,</i>

655
00:52:35,003 --> 00:52:38,267
<i>he decided to cut short his stay
at the hospital.</i>

656
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,416
Rudi?

657
00:52:42,481 --> 00:52:44,418
He was in the living room.

658
00:52:50,354 --> 00:52:51,457
What do I owe?

659
00:52:51,462 --> 00:52:53,005
3.50 marks.

660
00:52:56,788 --> 00:52:57,870
Thanks.

661
00:52:57,871 --> 00:52:59,055
Have a nice day.

662
00:53:04,263 --> 00:53:05,892
Rudi, where are you?

663
00:53:42,634 --> 00:53:43,825
Hello, Rudi.

664
00:53:48,521 --> 00:53:50,807
Won't you say hello to your father?

665
00:53:52,966 --> 00:53:53,991
No?

666
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:57,512
I heard

667
00:53:57,914 --> 00:54:00,656
you wanted to visit me
at the hospital.

668
00:54:02,397 --> 00:54:04,223
And now you lock yourself in?

669
00:54:09,536 --> 00:54:10,651
All right.

670
00:54:12,366 --> 00:54:14,427
Then I don't want to see you.

671
00:54:15,455 --> 00:54:17,059
I'm going away now.

672
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:20,463
Stay in the toilet, if you want.

673
00:54:31,116 --> 00:54:32,343
Keep well, Rudi.

674
00:55:45,867 --> 00:55:49,747
Your office is ready.
Mrs Wagner did it all.

675
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:53,627
- Why do you tell me that?
- I don't know.

676
00:55:54,716 --> 00:55:56,683
I thought you'd like to know.

677
00:55:57,732 --> 00:55:59,674
- She took good care of you?
- Yes.

678
00:56:08,149 --> 00:56:09,520
How old are you now?

679
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:11,491
14.

680
00:56:16,778 --> 00:56:17,946
It's amazing,

681
00:56:19,019 --> 00:56:20,433
you look so like your mother.

682
00:56:37,499 --> 00:56:40,345
... your mother and I
are very worried about you.

683
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:44,300
Think carefully. Do you sleep badly?

684
00:56:44,535 --> 00:56:46,025
Are you overtired?

685
00:56:46,026 --> 00:56:47,246
No.

686
00:56:48,661 --> 00:56:52,123
Do you have problems at school
I don't know?

687
00:56:53,138 --> 00:56:54,274
No, Father.

688
00:56:58,569 --> 00:57:00,795
You don't understand why we worry.

689
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:03,394
I'll explain it to you.

690
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,175
As you know,
I'm also the pastor for Birkenbrunn.

691
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:12,137
One day, a mother came to see me,

692
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,304
as her son,
about the same age as you,

693
00:57:15,906 --> 00:57:17,475
had the same symptoms

694
00:57:19,293 --> 00:57:21,745
you've shown for some time.

695
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:26,244
The boy suddenly seemed
extremely weary.

696
00:57:27,203 --> 00:57:30,839
His eyes were ringed,
he was depressed and joyless.

697
00:57:33,989 --> 00:57:36,984
He avoided looking his parents
in the eye,

698
00:57:38,218 --> 00:57:43,003
and soon was also caught lying.

699
00:57:53,565 --> 00:57:55,494
This lasted about half a year.

700
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:58,456
Then everything went very fast.

701
00:57:59,802 --> 00:58:01,568
He lost his appetite,

702
00:58:03,069 --> 00:58:06,484
couldn't sleep any more,
his hands began to shake,

703
00:58:08,132 --> 00:58:09,772
his memory started to fail,

704
00:58:10,942 --> 00:58:13,196
his face became
covered with pustules,

705
00:58:13,642 --> 00:58:15,119
then his whole body.

706
00:58:16,802 --> 00:58:18,171
Finally, he died.

707
00:58:20,716 --> 00:58:24,633
The body, that I had to bless,
looked like an old man's body.

708
00:58:27,247 --> 00:58:29,637
Do you understand now
why I'm worried?

709
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:34,800
What do you think
caused these changes

710
00:58:35,101 --> 00:58:38,715
that led
to that boy's miserable end?

711
00:58:39,287 --> 00:58:40,675
I don't know.

712
00:58:43,081 --> 00:58:45,300
I think you know very well.

713
00:59:02,587 --> 00:59:04,333
Won't you tell me?

714
00:59:06,568 --> 00:59:07,579
No?

715
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:13,296
Then I'll give you the answer.

716
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,491
The boy had seen someone,

717
00:59:17,758 --> 00:59:20,587
who was harming
the finest nerves of his body,

718
00:59:20,925 --> 00:59:24,207
in the area where God
has erected sacred barriers.

719
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,575
The boy imitated this action.

720
00:59:27,769 --> 00:59:30,223
He couldn't stop doing it.

721
00:59:32,696 --> 00:59:36,909
In the end he destroyed
all his nerves, and died of it.

722
00:59:40,308 --> 00:59:41,890
I just want to help you.

723
00:59:43,196 --> 00:59:44,970
I love you with all my heart.

724
00:59:46,175 --> 00:59:48,174
Be sincere, Martin.

725
00:59:48,955 --> 00:59:52,588
Why did you blush listening
to the story of the poor boy?

726
00:59:53,174 --> 00:59:54,319
Blush?

727
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:57,392
I don't know. I felt sorry for him.

728
00:59:58,466 --> 01:00:00,015
Is that all?

729
01:00:02,491 --> 01:00:05,141
I think there's another reason.

730
01:00:05,441 --> 01:00:07,198
It's written on your face.

731
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,227
Be sincere,

732
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:11,551
Martin!

733
01:00:14,081 --> 01:00:15,694
Why are you crying?

734
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:18,714
Shall I spare you that confession?

735
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:23,934
Have you been doing
what that wretched boy did?

736
01:00:24,851 --> 01:00:25,981
Yes.

737
01:00:40,814 --> 01:00:42,130
My arm!

738
01:01:12,788 --> 01:01:15,583
Glad that you're back. About time.

739
01:01:16,615 --> 01:01:18,269
One can say that. Yes.

740
01:01:25,692 --> 01:01:28,069
It was hard with the children,
without you.

741
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,090
I know.

742
01:01:36,627 --> 01:01:37,892
He doesn't like me.

743
01:01:38,825 --> 01:01:40,555
- Who?
- Rudi.

744
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:44,271
He's at a difficult age.

745
01:01:45,772 --> 01:01:47,336
Actually not.

746
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:51,477
They're always at a difficult age.

747
01:01:54,015 --> 01:01:55,033
Yes.

748
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,304
You didn't miss me.

749
01:02:01,934 --> 01:02:03,253
What does that mean?

750
01:02:04,939 --> 01:02:07,578
Nothing.
I said it because it's true.

751
01:02:12,101 --> 01:02:14,922
Nothing like
a nice dose of self-hate!

752
01:02:15,596 --> 01:02:16,596
What?

753
01:02:17,276 --> 01:02:19,463
Nothing. Forget it.

754
01:02:45,776 --> 01:02:48,327
<i>Winter came early that year.</i>

755
01:02:48,328 --> 01:02:51,984
<i>For Reformation Day,
on the first Sunday of November,</i>

756
01:02:52,266 --> 01:02:54,697
<i>a blanket of snow
covered the village.</i>

757
01:02:55,589 --> 01:03:00,373
<i>Quite unusually, the Baron,
whose family had not yet come back,</i>

758
01:03:00,687 --> 01:03:02,206
<i>didn't attend the service.</i>

759
01:03:03,792 --> 01:03:07,471
<i>The villagers took that
as a sign of his anger.</i>

760
01:03:08,056 --> 01:03:09,927
<i>Indeed, no leads had been found</i>

761
01:03:09,928 --> 01:03:11,798
<i>to a possible culprit,</i>

762
01:03:12,124 --> 01:03:14,318
<i>although the Baron's appeal</i>

763
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:16,513
<i>had led to a flood
of mutual suspicions,</i>

764
01:03:16,702 --> 01:03:20,179
<i>even to some attempts
at denunciation,</i>

765
01:03:21,421 --> 01:03:24,952
<i>that had all turned out
to be untenable.</i>

766
01:03:38,188 --> 01:03:40,106
Well, it's not pneumonia.

767
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,128
But you must be careful.

768
01:03:42,663 --> 01:03:45,089
If his temperature rises,
call me again.

769
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:48,076
Give him these drops
every two hours.

770
01:03:48,648 --> 01:03:50,783
And hang wet sheets over the oven.

771
01:03:50,784 --> 01:03:52,519
That helps breathing.

772
01:03:54,147 --> 01:03:56,009
- Good night to you.
- Good-bye, Doctor.

773
01:04:01,959 --> 01:04:03,789
How long was the window open?

774
01:04:04,663 --> 01:04:08,189
Hard to say.
My wife nursed him around 1 AM.

775
01:04:08,667 --> 01:04:10,354
She came back around 2:30 AM.

776
01:04:10,355 --> 01:04:12,041
By then the room was icy cold.

777
01:04:12,295 --> 01:04:14,066
And the baby didn't cry?

778
01:04:14,971 --> 01:04:16,875
No. The children heard nothing.

779
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,794
He's doing all right.
We have to wait.

780
01:04:23,507 --> 01:04:25,671
But it looks fairly good.

781
01:04:26,119 --> 01:04:28,013
A drink to warm you up?

782
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:30,997
Or stay for supper.

783
01:04:31,176 --> 01:04:34,858
No, thanks. I'm overloaded,
I was away so long.

784
01:04:41,391 --> 01:04:43,477
How's your arm doing?

785
01:04:44,883 --> 01:04:46,136
It's all right.

786
01:04:46,518 --> 01:04:49,549
It'll be fine
in two or three weeks.

787
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:50,868
Thank you.

788
01:04:52,134 --> 01:04:53,853
That must be terrible, I imagine.

789
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:57,048
One must be helpless
with only one arm.

790
01:04:57,304 --> 01:04:59,249
Quod erat demonstrandum.

791
01:05:02,097 --> 01:05:03,793
Well, good night, children.

792
01:05:04,044 --> 01:05:05,300
Good night, Doctor.

793
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:08,990
If your wife thinks
the baby's fever has risen again,

794
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:10,324
let me know.

795
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:21,762
Good...

796
01:05:23,369 --> 01:05:24,711
What do you mean "good"?

797
01:05:28,118 --> 01:05:29,601
I mean, that's fine.

798
01:05:36,877 --> 01:05:38,583
When did you go see Father?

799
01:05:39,317 --> 01:05:40,904
Down in his office.

800
01:05:44,168 --> 01:05:45,246
Why?

801
01:05:46,867 --> 01:05:47,949
Just asking.

802
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:53,610
<i>In mid-December,
I finally got a letter from Eva.</i>

803
01:05:54,697 --> 01:05:58,002
<i>Her father 
had found her a job in town,</i>

804
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:01,269
<i>that she'd start early
in the New Year.</i>

805
01:06:02,435 --> 01:06:05,718
<i>Since the night she came
to shelter in the school,</i>

806
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:07,818
<i>when until dawn,</i>

807
01:06:07,853 --> 01:06:11,466
<i>we told each other the story
of our short lives,</i>

808
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:13,703
<i>her pale face,</i>

809
01:06:13,738 --> 01:06:17,337
<i>her shy but frank personality,</i>

810
01:06:17,926 --> 01:06:19,935
<i>were constantly on my mind.</i>

811
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:25,178
<i>The school holidays
lasted until January 2nd,</i>

812
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,469
<i>but already
on the day after Christmas,</i>

813
01:06:28,504 --> 01:06:30,759
<i>in the cold but sunny weather,</i>

814
01:06:31,471 --> 01:06:33,189
<i>I headed for Treglitz</i>

815
01:06:33,224 --> 01:06:35,926
<i>to visit Eva and her parents.</i>

816
01:06:36,633 --> 01:06:37,771
And Sigi?

817
01:06:39,586 --> 01:06:42,377
I don't know.
The Baroness isn't back yet.

818
01:06:46,462 --> 01:06:47,662
And the Baron?

819
01:06:49,715 --> 01:06:52,684
We hardly see him.
He talks to nobody.

820
01:06:56,904 --> 01:06:59,969
I don't know.
Some say they went to Italy.

821
01:07:00,069 --> 01:07:01,296
To Italy?

822
01:07:13,013 --> 01:07:16,755
The steward says they'll tear down
the sawmill. Because it's...

823
01:07:19,228 --> 01:07:20,368
Good morning.

824
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:21,789
Morning, young man.

825
01:07:22,049 --> 01:07:24,577
Please be seated. 
We're not very formal here.

826
01:07:24,901 --> 01:07:26,210
Scram!

827
01:07:41,237 --> 01:07:42,294
Care for a drink?

828
01:07:42,451 --> 01:07:43,845
No, thanks. Very kind.

829
01:07:44,086 --> 01:07:45,907
- Really?
- No, thanks a lot.

830
01:07:50,988 --> 01:07:52,350
So you're a schoolteacher?

831
01:07:54,086 --> 01:07:56,133
Can you afford to have a wife?

832
01:07:57,238 --> 01:08:00,242
My father's a tailor at Vasendorf.
I've learned the trade.

833
01:08:00,277 --> 01:08:02,129
I earn money on the side.

834
01:08:02,895 --> 01:08:06,497
Taking over his business
would've been smarter.

835
01:08:13,649 --> 01:08:16,419
And why are you so focused on Eva?

836
01:08:16,664 --> 01:08:20,218
She's still a child.
You could be her father.

837
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:22,006
I'm 31.

838
01:08:22,336 --> 01:08:24,244
Well, you're not far off.

839
01:08:24,574 --> 01:08:25,624
Father!

840
01:08:32,053 --> 01:08:34,667
Have you asked her
if she's interested?

841
01:08:34,904 --> 01:08:38,246
She's a child,
knows nothing about life.

842
01:08:39,546 --> 01:08:41,891
Speak up. Do you want him?

843
01:08:43,803 --> 01:08:45,725
Come on. Say something.

844
01:08:47,777 --> 01:08:49,541
He came all this way in the cold.

845
01:08:49,817 --> 01:08:53,570
Leave her alone. Of course,
she wants him. Can't you tell?

846
01:08:53,822 --> 01:08:55,920
How can I, if she clams up!

847
01:09:05,005 --> 01:09:06,682
Sit down again.

848
01:09:09,255 --> 01:09:10,309
Women!

849
01:09:12,057 --> 01:09:13,927
Don't take them too seriously.

850
01:09:16,524 --> 01:09:19,339
Listen, I'm not a big talker.

851
01:09:20,642 --> 01:09:23,274
On one hand, it suits mea
if she leaves the house.

852
01:09:23,527 --> 01:09:25,997
Lots of mouths to feed,
as you can see.

853
01:09:27,825 --> 01:09:29,216
On the other hand,

854
01:09:30,176 --> 01:09:32,701
it's moving too fast for me.

855
01:09:33,293 --> 01:09:34,755
I don't know you.

856
01:09:35,356 --> 01:09:38,597
I don't dislike you,
but I need to know more about you.

857
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:45,717
The town hairdresser has agreed
to take her on as an apprentice.

858
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:48,489
She'll get to meet people,

859
01:09:49,815 --> 01:09:51,888
she can decide
if she really wants this.

860
01:09:53,386 --> 01:09:55,832
If in a year
she's still in favor of it,

861
01:09:55,867 --> 01:09:57,528
we'll talk about it again.

862
01:09:59,485 --> 01:10:01,481
You can make up your mind too.

863
01:10:03,045 --> 01:10:04,157
All right?

864
01:10:04,499 --> 01:10:06,749
- I actually thought I...
- Yes, I know.

865
01:10:07,693 --> 01:10:11,170
But it's either that or nothing.

866
01:10:15,135 --> 01:10:16,374
If you insist...

867
01:10:16,409 --> 01:10:17,948
Yes, I do.

868
01:10:23,939 --> 01:10:25,034
Delighted.

869
01:10:28,618 --> 01:10:31,522
So, my work's waiting.

870
01:10:32,308 --> 01:10:34,541
Even on holidays.

871
01:10:35,217 --> 01:10:36,505
Don't get up.

872
01:10:37,798 --> 01:10:39,086
I'll send the kid back in.

873
01:10:43,329 --> 01:10:45,100
So you can say good bye.

874
01:10:45,406 --> 01:10:47,941
A year goes by fast.
The world won't collapse.

875
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:51,913
You can come and visit her.

876
01:11:31,883 --> 01:11:33,420
Did your father tell you...?

877
01:11:44,153 --> 01:11:45,415
Is that all right with you?

878
01:11:48,573 --> 01:11:50,008
And is it with you, sir?

879
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:53,680
Don't call me "sir".

880
01:12:18,318 --> 01:12:19,719
Adi! Are you awake?

881
01:12:21,147 --> 01:12:22,323
Adi!

882
01:12:23,641 --> 01:12:24,866
What is it?

883
01:12:24,928 --> 01:12:25,929
Look!

884
01:12:26,852 --> 01:12:28,206
What's happening?

885
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:30,705
Look! Go see what's happening!

886
01:12:32,027 --> 01:12:33,848
My God, what do you want?

887
01:12:34,148 --> 01:12:36,114
Over there! Look out the window!

888
01:12:47,102 --> 01:12:49,270
Something's burning! On the estate!

889
01:12:49,568 --> 01:12:50,820
Untie me!

890
01:12:51,285 --> 01:12:52,558
Come on, untie me!

891
01:12:53,343 --> 01:12:54,578
I don't know if...

892
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:55,838
Untie me, I said!

893
01:12:56,101 --> 01:12:57,625
What is it?

894
01:12:57,959 --> 01:12:59,072
Be quiet!

895
01:12:59,405 --> 01:13:01,076
Gustl, come and untie me!

896
01:13:02,165 --> 01:13:03,602
What's going on?

897
01:13:04,488 --> 01:13:06,985
Untie me, dammit!
There's a fire!

898
01:13:07,775 --> 01:13:09,620
What fire?

899
01:13:15,868 --> 01:13:17,154
A fire!

900
01:13:17,213 --> 01:13:19,717
Yes, a fire! Now untie me, dammit!

901
01:13:21,992 --> 01:13:23,431
Father won't allow it.

902
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:26,427
It's an emergency!
Somebody must warn them!

903
01:13:26,713 --> 01:13:27,713
Father!

904
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:30,596
Stop shouting! I'll do it!

905
01:13:34,741 --> 01:13:36,468
Shall I call Mom?

906
01:13:41,297 --> 01:13:43,071
- What is it?
- A fire!

907
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:45,398
I know. Your father already went.

908
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:49,118
What are you doing here?

909
01:13:49,518 --> 01:13:52,121
Go to bed now! It's nothing.

910
01:13:52,851 --> 01:13:55,769
There's a fire on the estate.
Don't be afraid.

911
01:13:56,175 --> 01:13:58,268
Go to bed and sleep.

912
01:14:00,318 --> 01:14:02,566
Go on! You'll catch a cold.

913
01:14:07,021 --> 01:14:09,391
Why all the noise?
You woke them all up!

914
01:14:09,673 --> 01:14:11,789
I thought it was dangerous.

915
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,981
I had to untie him.

916
01:14:14,251 --> 01:14:15,972
Now everything's fine again.

917
01:14:16,301 --> 01:14:18,983
Tomorrow,
Father will tell you about the fire.

918
01:14:19,403 --> 01:14:20,722
You all go back to bed.

919
01:14:21,612 --> 01:14:23,225
I'll wait till you're in bed.

920
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:25,620
It's cold here.

921
01:14:37,727 --> 01:14:38,927
Good night, then.

922
01:14:40,413 --> 01:14:41,626
Sleep tight.

923
01:14:41,907 --> 01:14:43,318
Night, Mom!

924
01:16:41,811 --> 01:16:43,379
Why don't you stop doing that?

925
01:16:48,024 --> 01:16:49,102
Why all the effort?

926
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:52,175
Don't look so dumbfounded.

927
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:54,258
You don't lack talent.

928
01:16:54,534 --> 01:16:56,791
I just can't do it
with you any more.

929
01:16:58,468 --> 01:17:00,758
To be truthful: you disgust me.

930
01:17:02,116 --> 01:17:03,519
Can't you finish your work?

931
01:17:03,773 --> 01:17:05,781
I don't want
to spend the night here.

932
01:17:11,019 --> 01:17:12,154
What did I do to you?

933
01:17:12,379 --> 01:17:14,846
My God, you've done nothing to me!

934
01:17:16,651 --> 01:17:18,642
You're ugly, messy,

935
01:17:18,908 --> 01:17:21,919
flabby and have bad breath.
Will that do?

936
01:17:21,954 --> 01:17:27,368
The cover has to be sterilized.

937
01:17:27,403 --> 01:17:32,327
Don't sit there
looking like death warmed over.

938
01:17:32,739 --> 01:17:35,033
The world won't collapse.
Not on you,

939
01:17:35,068 --> 01:17:37,118
or on me.

940
01:17:41,022 --> 01:17:43,322
I can't go on with this, that's all.

941
01:17:46,289 --> 01:17:48,047
I've really tried...

942
01:17:49,666 --> 01:17:53,111
to think of another woman
while making love to you.

943
01:17:54,134 --> 01:17:55,880
One who smells good,

944
01:17:57,571 --> 01:17:59,843
who's young, less decrepit than you,

945
01:18:00,871 --> 01:18:03,230
but my imagination can't manage it.

946
01:18:05,366 --> 01:18:07,181
In the end, it's you again

947
01:18:07,946 --> 01:18:10,067
and then I feel like puking,

948
01:18:11,086 --> 01:18:12,683
and am embarrassed at myself.

949
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:14,265
So what's the point?

950
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:19,545
Are you through?

951
01:18:20,212 --> 01:18:21,607
I have been for ages.

952
01:18:23,059 --> 01:18:25,367
You must be very unhappy
to be so mean.

953
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:27,391
Please, not that routine!

954
01:18:30,469 --> 01:18:32,639
I know I'm not much to look at.

955
01:18:33,402 --> 01:18:36,992
My bad breath comes from my ulcer,
you know that.

956
01:18:38,141 --> 01:18:41,189
It didn't bother you in the past.

957
01:18:41,685 --> 01:18:43,936
I had it when your wife was alive.

958
01:18:44,168 --> 01:18:46,855
Spare me these sordid details.

959
01:18:47,111 --> 01:18:50,198
Let me reassure you:
it always disgusted me.

960
01:18:51,776 --> 01:18:54,941
After Julie's death,
I wanted to ease my pain

961
01:18:55,178 --> 01:18:58,245
with anyone.
I could have screwed a cow!

962
01:19:00,275 --> 01:19:01,843
Whores are too far from here,

963
01:19:02,121 --> 01:19:04,715
and once every two months
isn't enough for me,

964
01:19:04,957 --> 01:19:07,082
even though I'm getting on.

965
01:19:07,687 --> 01:19:10,970
So skip acting like a martyr,
and scram.

966
01:19:13,133 --> 01:19:14,974
Why are you only noticing this now?

967
01:19:15,613 --> 01:19:18,713
When should I have noticed it?

968
01:19:20,366 --> 01:19:23,624
At the hospital,
I forgot how tiresome you are.

969
01:19:24,698 --> 01:19:27,208
One grows sentimental when in pain.

970
01:19:28,994 --> 01:19:31,507
Get out! Don't you have any pride?

971
01:19:32,757 --> 01:19:35,026
There's no room for any with you.

972
01:19:36,862 --> 01:19:38,052
That's true.

973
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:42,393
What if I do something silly?

974
01:19:44,051 --> 01:19:45,177
Go ahead.

975
01:19:45,619 --> 01:19:47,915
It'd surprise me. But be careful:

976
01:19:48,198 --> 01:19:49,833
it may be painful.

977
01:19:50,941 --> 01:19:52,699
I know, I'm ridiculous.

978
01:19:54,385 --> 01:19:56,480
You wouldn't care anyway.

979
01:19:56,715 --> 01:19:57,734
Well...

980
01:20:00,763 --> 01:20:02,709
Why do you despise me?

981
01:20:03,515 --> 01:20:06,294
For helping to raise the boy?

982
01:20:08,168 --> 01:20:10,611
For watching you
finger your daughter

983
01:20:10,758 --> 01:20:12,135
and saying nothing?

984
01:20:14,524 --> 01:20:16,922
For helping you to deceive yourself?

985
01:20:17,933 --> 01:20:20,703
For listening to you
claim how you loved Julie,

986
01:20:20,738 --> 01:20:24,913
when everyone knew
you treated her as badly as me?

987
01:20:27,667 --> 01:20:30,870
For loving you,
when I know you can't stand

988
01:20:30,873 --> 01:20:32,073
being loved?

989
01:20:32,123 --> 01:20:33,250
That's it.

990
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:35,718
Now get up. I have work to do.

991
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:40,042
You can't afford to get rid of me.

992
01:20:40,734 --> 01:20:42,436
Who'll do the dirty work for you,

993
01:20:42,471 --> 01:20:45,399
who'll help you with the kids,
and your practice?

994
01:20:46,889 --> 01:20:48,555
You don't mean what you're saying.

995
01:20:48,874 --> 01:20:51,315
I want to see how far you can go:

996
01:20:51,538 --> 01:20:54,885
"Will she take it?
Can I drag her even lower?"

997
01:20:57,986 --> 01:20:59,370
I'm tired too.

998
01:21:00,262 --> 01:21:02,848
I've got two retarded kids:
Karli and you.

999
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:04,473
You're the most troublesome one.

1000
01:21:06,713 --> 01:21:08,913
My God, why don't you just die?

1001
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:44,921
<i>The year ended with fine weather.</i>

1002
01:22:45,687 --> 01:22:47,901
<i>The snowy landscape
sparkled so brightly</i>

1003
01:22:48,331 --> 01:22:50,355
<i>that it hurt the eyes.</i>

1004
01:22:50,965 --> 01:22:52,108
<i>None of us suspected</i>

1005
01:22:52,442 --> 01:22:55,092
<i>it'd be our last New Year
in an era of peace,</i>

1006
01:22:55,127 --> 01:22:59,118
<i>and that this year
would bring a radical change,</i>

1007
01:22:59,344 --> 01:23:03,050
<i>of a magnitude we couldn't foresee.</i>

1008
01:23:05,817 --> 01:23:10,156
<i>Despite the strange events
that had unsettled the village,</i>

1009
01:23:10,846 --> 01:23:13,654
<i>we thought of ourselves
as united in the belief</i>

1010
01:23:13,907 --> 01:23:17,834
<i>that life in our community
was God's will, and worth living.</i>

1011
01:23:18,166 --> 01:23:21,452
... Christ's body
as bread and as wine.

1012
01:23:22,879 --> 01:23:27,180
May the period of preparation
for your confirmation

1013
01:23:28,063 --> 01:23:29,526
be one of happiness

1014
01:23:30,233 --> 01:23:31,751
and enrichment.

1015
01:23:35,116 --> 01:23:37,159
You, Martin,

1016
01:23:38,139 --> 01:23:41,412
will now be free
not only of that ribbon,

1017
01:23:41,861 --> 01:23:45,517
but of those nightly ties

1018
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:49,594
that kept you from yielding to
the temptations of your young body.

1019
01:23:54,856 --> 01:23:57,611
I trust you, my beloved children,

1020
01:23:58,213 --> 01:24:01,003
and wish you
a profitable and happy new year.

1021
01:24:04,881 --> 01:24:07,312
<i>Shortly after Easter,
in the last week of April,</i>

1022
01:24:07,347 --> 01:24:09,945
<i>the Baroness came back
with the children.</i>

1023
01:24:10,227 --> 01:24:12,922
<i>She was accompanied by a new nanny.</i>

1024
01:24:13,901 --> 01:24:18,345
<i>My secret hope
that Eva could come back here,</i>

1025
01:24:18,632 --> 01:24:20,262
<i>was definitely dashed.</i>

1026
01:24:21,361 --> 01:24:24,372
<i>The new nanny was an Italian woman</i>

1027
01:24:24,407 --> 01:24:28,226
<i>who came from the area
on the Mediterranean coast</i>

1028
01:24:28,501 --> 01:24:31,386
<i>where the Baroness
had spent the winter.</i>

1029
01:24:31,505 --> 01:24:32,652
Sigi!

1030
01:24:34,725 --> 01:24:36,102
Hi, Ferdinand!

1031
01:24:36,541 --> 01:24:37,749
Wait!

1032
01:24:37,837 --> 01:24:39,384
I'll come down!

1033
01:24:41,351 --> 01:24:44,307
Stay here, Sigi!
You can see the boys later.

1034
01:24:44,308 --> 01:24:45,925
<i>Let him go, Madam.</i>

1035
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:48,242
<i>He's so happy to be back home!</i>

1036
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:50,979
All right, go.
But don't be too long.

1037
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:17,130
Marie-Luise?

1038
01:25:20,911 --> 01:25:22,174
Where are you?

1039
01:25:52,015 --> 01:25:53,103
Sigi!

1040
01:25:53,763 --> 01:25:55,813
<i>Won't you come say hello to your father?</i>

1041
01:26:13,976 --> 01:26:15,187
Watch out, he's coming!

1042
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:18,325
Be quiet!

1043
01:26:18,923 --> 01:26:20,612
For God's sake! Be quiet!

1044
01:26:20,863 --> 01:26:21,902
Quiet!

1045
01:26:44,683 --> 01:26:45,896
What's going on here?

1046
01:26:45,931 --> 01:26:47,467
Why are you still here?

1047
01:26:47,938 --> 01:26:50,233
There's a divinity class now!

1048
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:51,630
Get going!

1049
01:26:53,014 --> 01:26:54,391
How about a good-bye?

1050
01:26:54,570 --> 01:26:56,259
Good bye, sir!

1051
01:27:02,202 --> 01:27:03,236
Good bye, Pastor!

1052
01:27:04,653 --> 01:27:06,562
I'm sorry, Pastor. 
It won't happen again.

1053
01:27:10,309 --> 01:27:11,492
Good bye, Pastor.

1054
01:27:12,293 --> 01:27:13,473
Good bye.

1055
01:27:17,894 --> 01:27:19,419
Let us pray.

1056
01:27:21,341 --> 01:27:23,389
Our Father, who art in heaven

1057
01:27:24,124 --> 01:27:25,930
hallowed by Thy name,

1058
01:27:26,495 --> 01:27:29,308
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done

1059
01:27:29,686 --> 01:27:32,371
on earth as it is in Heaven.

1060
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:35,874
Give us this day our daily bread

1061
01:27:36,169 --> 01:27:38,284
and forgive us our trespasses

1062
01:27:38,543 --> 01:27:41,698
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1063
01:27:41,921 --> 01:27:43,825
And lead us not into temptation

1064
01:27:44,044 --> 01:27:46,664
but deliver us from evil

1065
01:27:46,915 --> 01:27:49,670
for Thine is the kingdom, the power

1066
01:27:50,217 --> 01:27:51,363
and the glory

1067
01:27:51,398 --> 01:27:53,115
for ever and ever.

1068
01:27:53,342 --> 01:27:54,460
Amen.

1069
01:27:56,182 --> 01:27:57,566
Sit down.

1070
01:28:10,542 --> 01:28:12,930
This is a very sad day for me.

1071
01:28:14,802 --> 01:28:18,868
In a few weeks, we all want
to celebrate your confirmation.

1072
01:28:20,342 --> 01:28:23,090
For months I've tried
to bring God's word closer to you,

1073
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:28,423
and make responsible
human beings out of you.

1074
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:32,488
Who do I face today?

1075
01:28:34,124 --> 01:28:35,388
Yelling monkeys,

1076
01:28:36,642 --> 01:28:40,690
undisciplined, as childish
as your 7-year-old classmates!

1077
01:28:43,653 --> 01:28:44,933
But to me,

1078
01:28:45,579 --> 01:28:47,438
what is even sadder

1079
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:50,566
is that my own daughter

1080
01:28:50,601 --> 01:28:53,691
plays the leading role
in this pitiful display.

1081
01:28:56,234 --> 01:28:59,145
Last year

1082
01:28:59,452 --> 01:29:02,038
I tied a white ribbon in her hair.

1083
01:29:03,954 --> 01:29:05,657
White, as you all know,

1084
01:29:05,911 --> 01:29:07,474
is the color of innocence.

1085
01:29:08,444 --> 01:29:11,575
The ribbon was meant
to help Klara avoid sin,

1086
01:29:13,018 --> 01:29:14,420
selfishness,

1087
01:29:14,455 --> 01:29:15,747
envy,

1088
01:29:16,657 --> 01:29:19,746
indecency, lies and sloth.

1089
01:29:21,887 --> 01:29:23,679
At the start of the year,

1090
01:29:24,962 --> 01:29:26,247
I navely believed

1091
01:29:26,527 --> 01:29:29,557
that she was now mature enough

1092
01:29:30,584 --> 01:29:32,392
not to need that ribbon any more.

1093
01:29:33,890 --> 01:29:36,130
That she'd become
responsible enough,

1094
01:29:36,165 --> 01:29:38,611
as the daughter
of the spiritual leader of...

1095
01:29:47,894 --> 01:29:49,181
Anni?

1096
01:30:05,645 --> 01:30:07,900
Anni? Where are you?

1097
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,584
Anni?

1098
01:31:27,252 --> 01:31:29,552
Rudi? What are you doing here?

1099
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:32,151
Why aren't you in bed?

1100
01:31:32,354 --> 01:31:34,799
I can't go to sleep.

1101
01:31:35,327 --> 01:31:37,534
Is that why you're wandering around?

1102
01:31:37,734 --> 01:31:40,398
I woke up and you weren't there.

1103
01:31:43,936 --> 01:31:46,576
Dad has pierced my earlobes.

1104
01:31:47,066 --> 01:31:48,749
Does it hurt?

1105
01:31:50,008 --> 01:31:51,263
Yes, a bit.

1106
01:31:51,298 --> 01:31:53,412
Is that why you're crying?

1107
01:31:53,447 --> 01:31:55,184
I'm not crying any more.

1108
01:31:58,178 --> 01:31:59,875
Beauty has to suffer.

1109
01:32:02,985 --> 01:32:04,635
That's what they say.

1110
01:32:12,574 --> 01:32:13,895
Go back to bed.

1111
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:16,102
Anni's coming.

1112
01:32:22,292 --> 01:32:26,106
I haven't worn earrings in ages,
so the holes closed up.

1113
01:32:30,448 --> 01:32:33,041
For Whitsun,

1114
01:32:33,539 --> 01:32:35,290
I'm getting Mom's.

1115
01:32:36,873 --> 01:32:38,189
The pretty ones,

1116
01:32:39,034 --> 01:32:40,034
you know?

1117
01:33:22,154 --> 01:33:25,156
<i>A few days
after Klara's fainting fit,</i>

1118
01:33:25,191 --> 01:33:26,792
<i>that frightened us all,</i>

1119
01:33:26,827 --> 01:33:30,500
<i>and left her feverish and weakened,</i>

1120
01:33:31,166 --> 01:33:34,146
<i>I went to see the steward,
on the eve of Whitsun</i>

1121
01:33:34,181 --> 01:33:36,679
<i>to borrow the carriage again.</i>

1122
01:33:37,534 --> 01:33:41,447
<i>Since my marriage proposal,
Eva wrote me once a week.</i>

1123
01:33:41,715 --> 01:33:45,913
<i>I felt she was alone
and lost in the city,</i>

1124
01:33:46,176 --> 01:33:50,660
<i>and was hinting for me
to come see her as soon as I could.</i>

1125
01:33:51,442 --> 01:33:53,869
<i>I wanted to spend Saturday with her</i>

1126
01:33:53,904 --> 01:33:55,803
<i>and be back on Sunday</i>

1127
01:33:55,838 --> 01:33:59,597
<i>to prepare the confirmation ceremony
with the pastor.</i>

1128
01:34:00,724 --> 01:34:03,343
<i>The steward had gone to the sawmill,</i>

1129
01:34:03,603 --> 01:34:06,360
<i>but was due back any minute.</i>

1130
01:34:31,083 --> 01:34:32,326
Good morning, sir.

1131
01:34:32,361 --> 01:34:33,699
Hello, Erna.

1132
01:34:43,103 --> 01:34:44,366
He's cute.

1133
01:34:46,263 --> 01:34:47,306
Do you like him?

1134
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:48,658
Yes. Very much.

1135
01:34:52,738 --> 01:34:54,912
He was quite sick last winter,
I was told.

1136
01:34:55,452 --> 01:34:56,788
Yes. Very sick.

1137
01:34:57,364 --> 01:35:00,654
But the doctor cured him, thank God.

1138
01:35:02,126 --> 01:35:03,807
Maybe I'll come back this evening.

1139
01:35:04,157 --> 01:35:06,128
I'm sure Father will come for coffee

1140
01:35:06,163 --> 01:35:07,278
at four.

1141
01:35:08,554 --> 01:35:09,934
Then I'll sit down again.

1142
01:35:10,238 --> 01:35:12,667
Can I get you something? A coffee?

1143
01:35:12,897 --> 01:35:14,356
It must be ready.

1144
01:35:14,657 --> 01:35:17,967
No, thanks.
I'll just sit and wait.

1145
01:35:18,002 --> 01:35:19,199
Sir!

1146
01:35:23,137 --> 01:35:25,731
Can dreams come true?

1147
01:35:27,937 --> 01:35:29,076
That depends.

1148
01:35:29,282 --> 01:35:30,450
On what?

1149
01:35:31,174 --> 01:35:32,570
On what does it depend?

1150
01:35:34,001 --> 01:35:37,639
If you dream of being
first in your class, and study hard,

1151
01:35:38,103 --> 01:35:39,859
your dream may come true.

1152
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:42,433
- I didn't mean that.
- Then what?

1153
01:35:44,049 --> 01:35:46,468
I mean, if you dream of something,

1154
01:35:46,945 --> 01:35:48,898
really dream it in your sleep,

1155
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:51,305
can it come true?

1156
01:35:52,436 --> 01:35:54,114
Why, what did you dream?

1157
01:35:57,967 --> 01:35:59,001
Tell me.

1158
01:35:59,849 --> 01:36:01,554
You have something on your mind.

1159
01:36:03,828 --> 01:36:05,171
So tell me.

1160
01:36:07,153 --> 01:36:09,103
I dreamt that Karli...

1161
01:36:10,118 --> 01:36:12,213
- the odd little boy of the...
- I know.

1162
01:36:12,901 --> 01:36:14,614
Something terrible
will happen to him.

1163
01:36:15,435 --> 01:36:16,770
Something terrible?

1164
01:36:17,776 --> 01:36:19,114
Like what?

1165
01:36:20,252 --> 01:36:21,682
I don't know.

1166
01:36:22,328 --> 01:36:24,254
Like what happened to Sigi.

1167
01:36:25,585 --> 01:36:26,683
But even worse.

1168
01:36:27,413 --> 01:36:30,411
But he's so sweet. He harms no one.

1169
01:36:30,675 --> 01:36:32,007
Come on...

1170
01:36:33,519 --> 01:36:36,685
It was only a dream.
Don't take it so seriously.

1171
01:36:45,653 --> 01:36:48,686
Dreams don't come true.
Let alone that kind.

1172
01:36:52,788 --> 01:36:55,518
But sometimes
my dreams do come true.

1173
01:36:55,989 --> 01:36:57,275
What do you mean?

1174
01:37:01,602 --> 01:37:02,829
Last winter,

1175
01:37:03,007 --> 01:37:05,521
before Gustl got sick,

1176
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:09,109
I dreamt
my brother opened his window,

1177
01:37:09,295 --> 01:37:11,015
so he'd die.

1178
01:37:11,218 --> 01:37:14,947
And his window was opened,
he caught a chill, almost died.

1179
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:19,094
What are you saying?

1180
01:37:19,402 --> 01:37:20,711
That's nonsense!

1181
01:37:41,034 --> 01:37:44,194
<i>We arranged to meet
at the railway station,</i>

1182
01:37:44,505 --> 01:37:47,731
<i>as Eva wanted to avoid
being seen with me.</i>

1183
01:37:48,267 --> 01:37:50,922
<i>She was living with distant cousins,</i>

1184
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:53,022
<i>who gave her parents</i>

1185
01:37:53,299 --> 01:37:56,718
<i>regular reports on her behavior.</i>

1186
01:37:57,068 --> 01:38:00,609
<i>She had become thinner,
which made her even prettier.</i>

1187
01:38:01,293 --> 01:38:03,894
<i>I was ravished again
by her mixture of shyness</i>

1188
01:38:03,929 --> 01:38:06,361
<i>and almost childlike outspokenness.</i>

1189
01:38:07,084 --> 01:38:08,756
So it's not really so awful?

1190
01:38:09,018 --> 01:38:11,712
No. But sweeping up hair all day...

1191
01:38:12,003 --> 01:38:13,412
The twins were more fun.

1192
01:38:13,654 --> 01:38:17,224
But it's all right.
I can't really complain.

1193
01:38:17,283 --> 01:38:18,299
No?

1194
01:38:18,334 --> 01:38:19,410
No.

1195
01:38:19,686 --> 01:38:20,749
Really.

1196
01:38:23,271 --> 01:38:25,332
Aside from the twins,
you miss nothing?

1197
01:38:27,620 --> 01:38:29,074
Come on, you!

1198
01:38:47,645 --> 01:38:49,926
How is the nanny? She only speaks Italian?

1199
01:38:50,235 --> 01:38:51,908
That's what the steward says.

1200
01:38:52,058 --> 01:38:53,204
I see.

1201
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:02,477
Where are you going?

1202
01:39:02,723 --> 01:39:05,370
There's a nice little pond
in the wood.

1203
01:39:05,724 --> 01:39:08,443
We can picnic there.
I brought some food.

1204
01:39:10,906 --> 01:39:13,004
- I'd rather not.
- Why?

1205
01:39:17,616 --> 01:39:18,816
What is it?

1206
01:39:19,637 --> 01:39:20,682
Nothing.

1207
01:39:21,676 --> 01:39:22,944
Please.

1208
01:39:25,403 --> 01:39:27,537
I had no improper intentions.

1209
01:39:27,818 --> 01:39:30,231
I just wanted you
to enjoy the picnic.

1210
01:39:33,014 --> 01:39:34,216
Please.

1211
01:39:35,761 --> 01:39:38,636
How could I disgrace my future wife?

1212
01:39:43,516 --> 01:39:44,843
All right then.

1213
01:39:44,934 --> 01:39:46,315
I'll turn around.

1214
01:39:59,336 --> 01:40:00,591
Thanks.

1215
01:40:29,765 --> 01:40:31,490
Accept and drink!

1216
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:34,881
This is the blood
of the New Testament,

1217
01:40:35,123 --> 01:40:36,836
shed for you

1218
01:40:37,090 --> 01:40:38,987
to forgive your sins.

1219
01:42:05,383 --> 01:42:06,726
Here! He's here!

1220
01:42:15,151 --> 01:42:16,393
Out of the way!

1221
01:42:29,292 --> 01:42:31,136
"For I, the Lord, your God

1222
01:42:31,206 --> 01:42:32,742
"am a jealous God

1223
01:42:33,658 --> 01:42:38,152
"visiting the iniquity of the fathers 
upon the children

1224
01:42:38,362 --> 01:42:41,105
unto the third 
and fourth generation."

1225
01:42:42,036 --> 01:42:45,306
<i>After the atrocities committed
on the retarded boy,</i>

1226
01:42:45,616 --> 01:42:48,602
<i>the Baron was finally convinced
it was smarter</i>

1227
01:42:48,845 --> 01:42:53,500
<i>to enlist the help
of the county's police force.</i>

1228
01:42:54,042 --> 01:42:55,521
<i>So a few days later</i>

1229
01:42:55,743 --> 01:42:58,460
<i>two plainclothes policemen arrived,</i>

1230
01:42:58,783 --> 01:43:01,791
<i>who, after visiting
several of the crime scenes,</i>

1231
01:43:02,057 --> 01:43:05,335
<i>inquired if anyone
had noticed anything suspicious.</i>

1232
01:43:06,369 --> 01:43:09,546
<i>When I learnt of Karli's torture,</i>

1233
01:43:09,731 --> 01:43:13,497
<i>I didn't think
of what Erna had told me.</i>

1234
01:43:13,775 --> 01:43:18,058
<i>When I remembered,
I hesitated to tell the authorities.</i>

1235
01:43:18,302 --> 01:43:22,211
<i>Such an absurd coincidence
might jeopardize</i>

1236
01:43:22,246 --> 01:43:25,800
<i>the reputation and inner peace
of the steward's family.</i>

1237
01:43:26,589 --> 01:43:31,546
<i>But when I heard that Karli
might lose his eyesight,</i>

1238
01:43:31,796 --> 01:43:34,308
<i>I made Erna come to the school</i>

1239
01:43:34,627 --> 01:43:37,130
<i>and tell the policemen
about her dream.</i>

1240
01:43:37,365 --> 01:43:39,431
... we're not as stupid as you think.

1241
01:43:39,731 --> 01:43:41,870
But I really dreamt it!

1242
01:43:46,638 --> 01:43:48,001
Watch out!

1243
01:43:50,115 --> 01:43:51,672
I'll give you one last chance:

1244
01:43:53,322 --> 01:43:56,841
tell us who told you
of a plan to torture the boy,

1245
01:43:57,181 --> 01:43:59,741
and we won't repeat it to anyone.

1246
01:43:59,954 --> 01:44:00,984
All right?

1247
01:44:05,234 --> 01:44:07,124
She's already had dreams
that came true.

1248
01:44:07,938 --> 01:44:09,110
Is that so?

1249
01:44:09,837 --> 01:44:11,064
About what, may I ask?

1250
01:44:12,735 --> 01:44:14,833
It was a family matter.

1251
01:44:15,299 --> 01:44:17,387
I see! A family matter.

1252
01:44:17,647 --> 01:44:19,557
You checked if it was true?

1253
01:44:19,783 --> 01:44:20,808
No.

1254
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:24,034
Well,

1255
01:44:25,274 --> 01:44:26,477
it may be true.

1256
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:30,115
Maybe she's
an authentic clairvoyant,

1257
01:44:30,475 --> 01:44:32,517
and we're luckier than we think.

1258
01:44:33,439 --> 01:44:34,749
Stop crying!

1259
01:44:37,293 --> 01:44:40,347
Your deceitful whining
won't work with me.

1260
01:44:40,629 --> 01:44:43,155
I've got other ways
to make you talk.

1261
01:44:44,124 --> 01:44:46,684
I don't believe in witches
and sorcerers,

1262
01:44:46,951 --> 01:44:50,946
even less in the hallucinations
of a brat like you.

1263
01:44:52,166 --> 01:44:54,352
So make up your mind
to tell me the truth.

1264
01:44:54,594 --> 01:44:57,290
I won't let go till you come clean.
Got that?

1265
01:44:59,109 --> 01:45:01,662
Now let's go see
what your parents think

1266
01:45:01,926 --> 01:45:04,371
of your version of the story.

1267
01:45:05,147 --> 01:45:06,917
Can you come with us?

1268
01:45:07,189 --> 01:45:08,335
Of course.

1269
01:45:10,518 --> 01:45:11,702
Hello, there!

1270
01:45:12,379 --> 01:45:13,607
Who do we have here?

1271
01:45:14,111 --> 01:45:15,329
Good afternoon.

1272
01:45:15,556 --> 01:45:16,745
Good afternoon, sir.

1273
01:45:18,539 --> 01:45:20,202
Why do you eavesdrop?

1274
01:45:20,431 --> 01:45:24,404
We saw the teacher had visitors.
We didn't want to intrude.

1275
01:45:24,697 --> 01:45:27,117
We were waiting to talk to him.

1276
01:45:27,322 --> 01:45:28,524
What do you want?

1277
01:45:29,745 --> 01:45:31,488
To ask you about Karli.

1278
01:45:31,679 --> 01:45:32,777
Like what?

1279
01:45:33,937 --> 01:45:35,747
We heard he isn't well.

1280
01:45:36,434 --> 01:45:38,465
We wondered if we could help.

1281
01:45:41,570 --> 01:45:42,702
You'll be all right...

1282
01:45:50,165 --> 01:45:51,712
I know, it hurts.

1283
01:46:02,008 --> 01:46:03,783
Be patient...

1284
01:46:11,701 --> 01:46:13,298
Everything will be fine again.

1285
01:46:14,055 --> 01:46:15,495
It'll be fine.

1286
01:46:26,051 --> 01:46:27,696
I have to go now, Karli.

1287
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:31,162
Don't worry.

1288
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:33,894
I'll be back tomorrow.

1289
01:46:38,359 --> 01:46:40,489
You'll be all right.
Don't be afraid.

1290
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:42,129
The doctor will be back.

1291
01:48:36,163 --> 01:48:37,344
Come in!

1292
01:48:46,533 --> 01:48:47,639
Yes?

1293
01:49:03,721 --> 01:49:04,810
What is it?

1294
01:49:07,007 --> 01:49:08,634
To replace Piepsi.

1295
01:49:09,310 --> 01:49:12,018
Because you're so sad.

1296
01:49:19,098 --> 01:49:20,216
Thank you.

1297
01:49:22,998 --> 01:49:24,621
You're welcome, Father.

1298
01:50:13,407 --> 01:50:15,445
- Give me the whistle!
- Sorry?

1299
01:50:15,728 --> 01:50:17,641
The whistle!

1300
01:50:17,970 --> 01:50:19,569
What whistle?

1301
01:50:20,374 --> 01:50:21,540
Give it to me!

1302
01:50:22,043 --> 01:50:23,429
What whistle?

1303
01:50:25,870 --> 01:50:27,481
Give it, or I'll kill you.

1304
01:50:27,752 --> 01:50:29,671
I have no whistle.

1305
01:50:31,032 --> 01:50:32,899
Bastard!

1306
01:50:33,222 --> 01:50:34,858
Wretch!

1307
01:50:35,082 --> 01:50:36,422
For God's sake,

1308
01:50:37,056 --> 01:50:38,396
what's got into you?

1309
01:50:38,935 --> 01:50:40,088
What has he done?

1310
01:50:41,055 --> 01:50:44,858
For the last time, give it to me!

1311
01:50:45,095 --> 01:50:46,487
Give you what, Father?

1312
01:50:46,745 --> 01:50:47,867
What is it?

1313
01:50:48,257 --> 01:50:49,762
What are you talking about?

1314
01:50:50,822 --> 01:50:52,419
You know what I mean!

1315
01:50:53,449 --> 01:50:55,715
But if he says so!
What's going on?

1316
01:51:01,714 --> 01:51:03,232
Please wait!

1317
01:51:04,447 --> 01:51:06,066
What did the boy do?

1318
01:51:06,336 --> 01:51:07,880
Calm down.

1319
01:51:08,653 --> 01:51:12,209
Stay out of it!
I have to go back to the Baron.

1320
01:51:29,729 --> 01:51:32,539
Georg! Please, don't!

1321
01:51:32,923 --> 01:51:34,805
You'll kill him!

1322
01:51:35,819 --> 01:51:39,187
... with the birch-trees in Retenow,
it'll be 6,000 cubic meters.

1323
01:51:40,125 --> 01:51:42,995
It'll take them around three weeks.

1324
01:51:45,425 --> 01:51:48,061
And now we have 80 extra Poles.

1325
01:51:48,769 --> 01:51:50,954
They've been put up in the annex.

1326
01:51:51,249 --> 01:51:53,353
We're all out of bedding.

1327
01:51:54,815 --> 01:51:56,356
It takes time.

1328
01:51:57,930 --> 01:51:59,746
There are lots of kids with them.

1329
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:01,946
In spite of it...

1330
01:52:01,981 --> 01:52:03,557
I won't stay here.

1331
01:52:04,131 --> 01:52:05,286
What?

1332
01:52:06,077 --> 01:52:07,555
I won't stay here.

1333
01:52:12,071 --> 01:52:13,273
What does that mean?

1334
01:52:13,809 --> 01:52:15,950
That I'm leaving with the children.

1335
01:52:17,057 --> 01:52:18,373
What do you mean?

1336
01:52:18,651 --> 01:52:20,978
Armin!
That's not so hard to understand.

1337
01:52:24,611 --> 01:52:25,860
How do you plan to do all this?

1338
01:52:27,555 --> 01:52:29,038
I don't know yet.

1339
01:52:29,801 --> 01:52:32,419
But in any case,
we're leaving this place.

1340
01:52:32,510 --> 01:52:33,613
"We"?

1341
01:52:34,814 --> 01:52:35,822
Yes.

1342
01:52:54,193 --> 01:52:55,500
That'll be all, thank you.

1343
01:52:55,763 --> 01:52:57,622
Good night, Baroness and Baron.

1344
01:53:13,447 --> 01:53:16,404
I only came back
out of fairness to you.

1345
01:53:20,059 --> 01:53:21,785
To give us a chance.

1346
01:53:26,096 --> 01:53:28,187
You gave me a chance?

1347
01:53:30,253 --> 01:53:32,835
Wonderful! And I missed my chance?

1348
01:53:33,865 --> 01:53:36,464
Will that help us
to solve the problem?

1349
01:53:36,706 --> 01:53:37,842
What?

1350
01:53:37,843 --> 01:53:39,185
Your sarcasm.

1351
01:53:39,256 --> 01:53:42,096
What is the problem 
we have to solve?

1352
01:53:45,407 --> 01:53:46,691
You stay here!

1353
01:53:50,684 --> 01:53:52,683
You'll only leave when I say so.

1354
01:54:01,572 --> 01:54:02,837
Fine.

1355
01:54:12,966 --> 01:54:15,387
I was hoping to spare you this.

1356
01:54:19,242 --> 01:54:22,480
At Uncle Edoardo's
I fell in love with a man.

1357
01:54:24,274 --> 01:54:25,981
He's from Lombardy

1358
01:54:26,208 --> 01:54:29,928
and is a banker who advised
Uncle Edoardo financially.

1359
01:54:32,078 --> 01:54:33,724
He courted me assiduously

1360
01:54:34,682 --> 01:54:36,953
and was very fond of the children.

1361
01:54:39,183 --> 01:54:42,495
It was thanks to him
that Sigi has blossomed.

1362
01:54:46,493 --> 01:54:48,474
Despite this, we came back.

1363
01:54:49,884 --> 01:54:51,826
Because I felt committed to you.

1364
01:54:54,852 --> 01:54:57,034
But I can't stand this place
any longer.

1365
01:54:58,040 --> 01:54:59,815
Not so much personally,

1366
01:55:00,485 --> 01:55:02,966
though life with you

1367
01:55:02,967 --> 01:55:05,447
isn't thrilling 
for a woman of my age.

1368
01:55:08,342 --> 01:55:12,039
I'm leaving so the children
don't grow up in surroundings

1369
01:55:12,260 --> 01:55:15,081
that are dominated by malice,

1370
01:55:16,210 --> 01:55:17,353
envy,

1371
01:55:17,968 --> 01:55:20,524
apathy and brutality.

1372
01:55:24,259 --> 01:55:27,197
Sigi's whistle was the last straw.

1373
01:55:30,193 --> 01:55:32,100
I'm sick and tired of persecutions,

1374
01:55:32,947 --> 01:55:35,433
threats
and perverse acts of revenge.

1375
01:55:41,697 --> 01:55:43,176
Did you sleep with him?

1376
01:55:45,319 --> 01:55:47,199
You don't understand anything.

1377
01:55:47,806 --> 01:55:49,419
Did you sleep with him?

1378
01:55:55,287 --> 01:55:56,918
No. I didn't sleep with him.

1379
01:55:59,221 --> 01:56:01,339
You're lying, right?

1380
01:56:08,823 --> 01:56:09,823
Come in!

1381
01:56:12,678 --> 01:56:13,950
Good evening.

1382
01:56:15,457 --> 01:56:16,621
Good evening, Baroness.

1383
01:56:17,026 --> 01:56:19,479
- Can I talk to you?
- Can't it wait?

1384
01:56:19,653 --> 01:56:22,790
No, or I wouldn't have
disturbed you so late.

1385
01:57:35,846 --> 01:57:37,001
What is it?

1386
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,998
They've assassinated 
Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo.

1387
01:57:44,372 --> 01:57:47,589
<i>The news spread around the village
like wildfire.</i>

1388
01:57:48,444 --> 01:57:50,322
<i>What would the consequences be?</i>

1389
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:54,530
<i>The first who said "war",
was severely contradicted.</i>

1390
01:57:55,684 --> 01:57:58,009
<i>But once the word had been uttered,</i>

1391
01:57:58,243 --> 01:58:02,474
<i>it remained stubbornly
at the center of all our thoughts.</i>

1392
01:58:04,219 --> 01:58:07,884
<i>I wanted to go to town quickly
to discuss with Eva</i>

1393
01:58:08,094 --> 01:58:11,287
<i>what we should do
if war broke out.</i>

1394
01:58:11,934 --> 01:58:15,655
<i>Maybe her father would now agreed
to an earlier marriage.</i>

1395
01:58:17,503 --> 01:58:19,536
<i>I asked the Baroness for the bicycle</i>

1396
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:22,236
<i>that Eva had borrowed previously.</i>

1397
01:58:23,038 --> 01:58:26,966
<i>I planned to use it
to visit her Sunday.</i>

1398
01:58:28,854 --> 01:58:32,896
<i>Friday when I went to pick up
the bicycle,</i>

1399
01:58:33,345 --> 01:58:36,601
<i>I witnessed a strange confrontation.</i>

1400
01:58:47,907 --> 01:58:49,510
What is it, Mrs Wagner?

1401
01:58:51,407 --> 01:58:52,688
Can I borrow your bicycle?

1402
01:58:52,936 --> 01:58:55,592
- It's not mine.
- Can I borrow it anyway?

1403
01:58:55,886 --> 01:58:59,033
I just borrowed it myself.
To visit my fiance.

1404
01:58:59,287 --> 01:59:00,584
Please!

1405
01:59:00,973 --> 01:59:02,851
Where do you want to go?

1406
01:59:03,157 --> 01:59:04,535
- To town.
- What for?

1407
01:59:04,779 --> 01:59:08,849
The stubborn steward
won't lend me a carriage.

1408
01:59:09,633 --> 01:59:11,391
Please lend it to me.

1409
01:59:11,640 --> 01:59:13,283
Why? What for?

1410
01:59:13,622 --> 01:59:16,901
To go to the police.
I know who committed those crimes.

1411
01:59:17,012 --> 01:59:18,153
Who?

1412
01:59:18,984 --> 01:59:20,322
Can I have the bicycle?

1413
01:59:21,140 --> 01:59:22,558
Why not tell me?

1414
01:59:22,775 --> 01:59:26,174
I'll only talk to the police.
I'm sick of insults.

1415
01:59:27,893 --> 01:59:29,742
What about the doctor's horse?

1416
01:59:29,965 --> 01:59:31,593
I don't know how to ride.

1417
01:59:33,816 --> 01:59:36,590
Please! Believe me!

1418
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:39,538
My son told me who did it to him.

1419
01:59:41,065 --> 01:59:42,707
He may lose his eyesight.

1420
01:59:43,589 --> 01:59:45,163
Lend it to me!

1421
01:59:48,469 --> 01:59:49,583
Thanks!

1422
01:59:53,070 --> 01:59:56,552
<i>I was so sorry that I gave in.</i>

1423
01:59:57,065 --> 01:59:59,312
<i>But the state of that woman,</i>

1424
01:59:59,313 --> 02:00:01,560
<i>usually so level headed, upset me.</i>

1425
02:00:02,289 --> 02:00:06,284
<i>What had she found out
that she didn't dare tell?</i>

1426
02:00:07,524 --> 02:00:10,869
<i>Back in the village,
I decided to investigate.</i>

1427
02:00:22,458 --> 02:00:23,642
Hello, sir.

1428
02:00:24,204 --> 02:00:25,368
Hello, Klara.

1429
02:00:27,736 --> 02:00:28,982
What are you doing here?

1430
02:00:31,305 --> 02:00:33,126
We wanted to see how Karli was.

1431
02:00:33,161 --> 02:00:36,424
Can't you see it's closed up?

1432
02:00:37,018 --> 02:00:38,741
Yes. We were worried.

1433
02:00:39,162 --> 02:00:42,142
We saw Mrs Wagner
bicycling off.

1434
02:00:42,951 --> 02:00:45,027
We wondered
what had happened to Karli.

1435
02:00:48,833 --> 02:00:51,114
Go home.
You don't belong in here.

1436
02:01:05,105 --> 02:01:06,779
Go on home.

1437
02:01:07,954 --> 02:01:09,115
Good bye, teacher.

1438
02:01:15,937 --> 02:01:20,435
<i>I wondered why the midwife
had closed the shutters.</i>

1439
02:01:20,921 --> 02:01:23,450
<i>Nobody in the village
locked their house.</i>

1440
02:01:23,979 --> 02:01:27,081
<i>Why had the midwife
locked in her son?</i>

1441
02:01:27,489 --> 02:01:28,911
<i>Karli, can you hear me?</i>

1442
02:01:33,736 --> 02:01:36,433
<i>I thought of Erna's dream again.</i>

1443
02:01:36,738 --> 02:01:38,437
<i>What if Erna hadn't dreamt it,</i>

1444
02:01:38,472 --> 02:01:41,203
<i>but knew that Karli 
would be tortured,</i>

1445
02:01:41,764 --> 02:01:43,991
<i>who had told her?</i>

1446
02:01:44,316 --> 02:01:46,841
<i>Who wouldn't she denounce?</i>

1447
02:01:48,016 --> 02:01:51,749
<i>The kids' interest in Karli 
seemed strange to me.</i>

1448
02:01:52,099 --> 02:01:55,661
<i>Usually, because of his disability,</i>

1449
02:01:55,696 --> 02:02:01,694
<i>they had no contact with him,
or treated him disdainfully.</i>

1450
02:02:02,878 --> 02:02:05,161
<i>When the midwife
couldn't take care of him,</i>

1451
02:02:05,472 --> 02:02:08,912
<i>she entrusted him to me
or the doctor.</i>

1452
02:02:09,203 --> 02:02:12,657
<i>But since his mishap,
I hadn't seen him again.</i>

1453
02:02:13,625 --> 02:02:16,755
<i>Worried,
I decided to ask the doctor.</i>

1454
02:02:17,077 --> 02:02:19,790
OFFICE CLOSED 
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

1455
02:02:25,227 --> 02:02:27,715
- Wasn't his daughter in school?
- Yes, she was.

1456
02:02:28,723 --> 02:02:30,273
And she said nothing?

1457
02:02:32,086 --> 02:02:33,300
I have a request...

1458
02:02:34,402 --> 02:02:36,359
Could I talk to Klara and Martin?

1459
02:02:36,613 --> 02:02:38,245
Won't you wait for my husband?

1460
02:02:38,567 --> 02:02:41,378
He's at the church.
The service is almost over.

1461
02:02:42,173 --> 02:02:44,070
But if you insist, please come in.

1462
02:02:45,949 --> 02:02:47,268
Be seated.

1463
02:02:48,274 --> 02:02:49,591
I'll fetch them for you.

1464
02:03:24,847 --> 02:03:25,998
Good evening, sir.

1465
02:03:27,644 --> 02:03:29,186
Won't you sit down?

1466
02:03:29,778 --> 02:03:31,359
Yes. Perhaps. With pleasure.

1467
02:03:32,264 --> 02:03:34,002
Can I offer you something?

1468
02:03:36,401 --> 02:03:38,442
A coffee,
like during the piano lessons?

1469
02:03:40,449 --> 02:03:42,679
Yes, with pleasure.
Very kind of you.

1470
02:03:42,904 --> 02:03:44,205
I'll be right back.

1471
02:03:49,579 --> 02:03:52,009
Did you know the doctor
was leaving Eichwald?

1472
02:03:53,749 --> 02:03:55,906
You're not surprised by my question?

1473
02:03:56,102 --> 02:03:59,346
Our mother just told us.

1474
02:04:00,823 --> 02:04:03,005
Anna didn't tell you?

1475
02:04:06,293 --> 02:04:07,658
Not a word?

1476
02:04:09,095 --> 02:04:12,255
It's odd not to say
you're going away on a trip.

1477
02:04:12,290 --> 02:04:14,025
Anna doesn't say much.

1478
02:04:14,026 --> 02:04:15,761
But this was completely different.

1479
02:04:18,619 --> 02:04:20,598
You're hiding something from me.

1480
02:04:20,912 --> 02:04:21,952
What?

1481
02:04:22,578 --> 02:04:24,598
I'm waiting for you to tell me.

1482
02:04:28,472 --> 02:04:30,709
When you looked for Karli,

1483
02:04:30,744 --> 02:04:32,504
what did you want from him?

1484
02:04:32,738 --> 02:04:34,638
We were worried. He's ill.

1485
02:04:34,673 --> 02:04:36,691
I'm asking Martin.

1486
02:04:37,551 --> 02:04:39,803
Yes. He isn't well.

1487
02:04:39,838 --> 02:04:42,083
And since his mother was leaving

1488
02:04:42,661 --> 02:04:45,093
we thought we'd pay him a visit.

1489
02:04:53,196 --> 02:04:56,714
Did you ever wonder
who mistreated Karli?

1490
02:04:58,369 --> 02:04:59,794
And Sigi?

1491
02:05:02,136 --> 02:05:04,405
Who tied the wire
to trip the doctor?

1492
02:05:04,622 --> 02:05:06,386
Who set fire to the barn?

1493
02:05:08,037 --> 02:05:09,099
No?

1494
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:10,574
Of course, we wondered.

1495
02:05:10,833 --> 02:05:11,903
Well?

1496
02:05:12,525 --> 02:05:15,570
Father said
it must be a sick person.

1497
02:05:19,101 --> 02:05:23,394
Sigi was with you at Thanksgiving.
And Karli always went along.

1498
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:25,196
I don't understand.

1499
02:05:25,198 --> 02:05:26,340
No?

1500
02:05:33,054 --> 02:05:34,251
What did they do wrong?

1501
02:05:35,447 --> 02:05:37,500
- Who?
- Sigi and Karli.

1502
02:05:37,633 --> 02:05:38,841
Why?

1503
02:05:38,890 --> 02:05:41,599
They obviously were being punished.
For what?

1504
02:05:41,710 --> 02:05:42,836
I don't know.

1505
02:05:43,139 --> 02:05:45,969
Erna foresaw that Karli
would be punished. What for?

1506
02:05:46,247 --> 02:05:47,399
I don't know!

1507
02:05:49,699 --> 02:05:50,885
Why ask us?

1508
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:54,335
You're a smart girl, Klara. 
Don't play dumb.

1509
02:05:57,144 --> 02:05:58,189
I don't understand.

1510
02:05:58,418 --> 02:06:01,777
Talk about this
with Father or Mother.

1511
02:06:01,982 --> 02:06:03,496
Shall I get them?

1512
02:06:03,637 --> 02:06:05,033
Martin, will you go?

1513
02:06:05,068 --> 02:06:06,790
Stay here, Martin.

1514
02:06:07,081 --> 02:06:09,718
I'll see them later.
Now, I'm talking to you.

1515
02:06:09,921 --> 02:06:12,286
Tell me the truth.

1516
02:06:12,519 --> 02:06:14,749
- Where were you when Karli was...
- Here.

1517
02:06:14,949 --> 02:06:17,306
I mean, after the confirmation?

1518
02:06:18,251 --> 02:06:19,764
Coffee's coming.

1519
02:06:24,174 --> 02:06:25,904
Could the children help you?

1520
02:06:28,048 --> 02:06:30,243
I'm afraid not. They know nothing.

1521
02:06:32,284 --> 02:06:34,557
His daughter said nothing at school?

1522
02:06:35,291 --> 02:06:36,312
No.

1523
02:06:37,529 --> 02:06:38,878
Sorry I disturbed you.

1524
02:06:38,913 --> 02:06:43,331
Stay! My husband is coming,
and the coffee is almost ready.

1525
02:06:43,366 --> 02:06:47,107
Thanks, but I'm worried
about the midwife's son.

1526
02:06:49,013 --> 02:06:52,105
- She didn't say when she'd be back?
- I didn't ask her.

1527
02:06:52,855 --> 02:06:55,240
She caught me off guard.
She was panicked.

1528
02:06:55,549 --> 02:06:57,361
Wait, I hear my husband.

1529
02:06:57,396 --> 02:07:00,810
Good evening.

1530
02:07:02,032 --> 02:07:03,890
The teacher was waiting for you.

1531
02:07:04,698 --> 02:07:06,946
Yes. I'd like a word with you.

1532
02:07:07,210 --> 02:07:10,507
Please. Let's go to my study.
It's quieter.

1533
02:07:15,261 --> 02:07:17,185
What's this about?

1534
02:07:19,907 --> 02:07:21,983
I spoke to the midwife:

1535
02:07:22,165 --> 02:07:24,867
she said she knew
who tortured her son.

1536
02:07:26,124 --> 02:07:29,989
She'll only tell the police,
and went to town.

1537
02:07:32,533 --> 02:07:33,533
Well?

1538
02:07:34,981 --> 02:07:38,517
She left the boy behind alone
and locked the house.

1539
02:07:39,735 --> 02:07:41,082
Locked it?

1540
02:07:43,473 --> 02:07:45,627
I went to ask the doctor

1541
02:07:45,662 --> 02:07:47,914
if he was caring
for the child, but...

1542
02:07:49,763 --> 02:07:52,777
there's a paper saying
that the office is closed.

1543
02:07:53,071 --> 02:07:55,509
He and his kids have disappeared.

1544
02:07:55,903 --> 02:07:56,992
What does it mean?

1545
02:07:57,173 --> 02:07:58,424
I don't know.

1546
02:07:59,173 --> 02:08:02,050
I thought you might know.
That's why I'm here.

1547
02:08:02,556 --> 02:08:03,601
I have no idea.

1548
02:08:05,211 --> 02:08:06,601
Please be seated.

1549
02:08:10,675 --> 02:08:13,153
Wasn't his daughter in school?

1550
02:08:13,374 --> 02:08:15,993
Yes. She mentioned nothing.

1551
02:08:19,078 --> 02:08:22,670
I asked Klara and Martin.
They know nothing either.

1552
02:08:23,215 --> 02:08:24,588
Why should they?

1553
02:08:26,983 --> 02:08:28,231
I don't know...

1554
02:08:29,276 --> 02:08:33,282
I went to Mrs Wagner's place:
they and some others were there.

1555
02:08:33,611 --> 02:08:34,989
To do what?

1556
02:08:35,382 --> 02:08:36,783
They were looking for the boy.

1557
02:08:37,105 --> 02:08:38,143
Why?

1558
02:08:38,778 --> 02:08:40,441
They wanted to help him.

1559
02:08:41,826 --> 02:08:42,880
So what?

1560
02:08:45,580 --> 02:08:47,365
I don't know how to say it...

1561
02:08:47,966 --> 02:08:50,160
I think they're hiding something.

1562
02:08:50,268 --> 02:08:51,398
What?

1563
02:08:53,569 --> 02:08:54,822
I don't know.

1564
02:08:56,344 --> 02:08:58,659
When the doctor had his accident,

1565
02:08:58,925 --> 02:09:00,557
last year,

1566
02:09:01,645 --> 02:09:05,683
they appeared in his garden.
Supposedly, to help Anna.

1567
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:08,672
Yes... and?

1568
02:09:10,537 --> 02:09:12,586
Nothing. I had forgotten it.

1569
02:09:13,370 --> 02:09:15,285
I just remembered today.

1570
02:09:16,554 --> 02:09:17,736
I don't understand.

1571
02:09:19,500 --> 02:09:21,985
When the Baron's son was found...

1572
02:09:22,183 --> 02:09:24,320
He'd been with the children
just before.

1573
02:09:27,619 --> 02:09:28,943
What are you getting at?

1574
02:09:30,450 --> 02:09:32,090
The steward's daughter

1575
02:09:32,403 --> 02:09:37,029
predicted that Karli
would be beaten.

1576
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:39,306
She says she dreamt it.

1577
02:09:39,799 --> 02:09:41,651
The police think she's lying.

1578
02:09:42,462 --> 02:09:45,700
From whom did she find out?
Who told her?

1579
02:10:02,035 --> 02:10:05,189
You're saying that your pupils,
my children included,

1580
02:10:05,224 --> 02:10:08,134
committed these crimes.
Is that right?

1581
02:10:11,944 --> 02:10:13,516
You realize what you're saying?

1582
02:10:14,502 --> 02:10:16,186
Do you really know...

1583
02:10:30,413 --> 02:10:32,307
I assume I'm the first person

1584
02:10:33,328 --> 02:10:35,914
to hear these monstrosities.

1585
02:10:38,249 --> 02:10:40,548
If you ever dare

1586
02:10:41,289 --> 02:10:43,113
to bother others with this,

1587
02:10:44,076 --> 02:10:45,738
if you ever accuse

1588
02:10:46,056 --> 02:10:48,664
respectable families and their children

1589
02:10:48,940 --> 02:10:50,646
and denounce them publicly,

1590
02:10:51,763 --> 02:10:54,864
I'll make sure, take my word for it,

1591
02:10:55,105 --> 02:10:56,651
that you go to prison.

1592
02:10:57,793 --> 02:11:01,713
I've seen a lot
during my work as a pastor,

1593
02:11:01,748 --> 02:11:05,300
but never anything so repulsive!

1594
02:11:07,241 --> 02:11:09,595
One can tell you have no children.

1595
02:11:11,079 --> 02:11:14,198
Or you wouldn't stoop
to such aberrations.

1596
02:11:16,567 --> 02:11:18,187
You have a sick mind.

1597
02:11:19,328 --> 02:11:23,371
How did they let you loose
among those poor creatures!

1598
02:11:25,134 --> 02:11:28,491
I'll speak to the authorities
about this.

1599
02:11:29,304 --> 02:11:31,269
Now get out of my house!

1600
02:11:32,650 --> 02:11:34,443
I don't want to see you here again.

1601
02:11:41,312 --> 02:11:43,491
<i>The midwife didn't come back.</i>

1602
02:11:44,530 --> 02:11:47,574
<i>I waited until morning,
two days later.</i>

1603
02:11:47,903 --> 02:11:49,308
<i>Then I went to the manor house</i>

1604
02:11:49,343 --> 02:11:51,454
<i>to inform the Baron.</i>

1605
02:11:51,728 --> 02:11:54,746
<i>He told the steward
and said to open the house</i>

1606
02:11:54,781 --> 02:11:56,696
<i>and take care of the disabled boy.</i>

1607
02:11:56,996 --> 02:11:58,146
<i>I'll look upstairs.</i>

1608
02:11:59,797 --> 02:12:02,432
<i>I'd never been
in the midwife's house</i>

1609
02:12:02,705 --> 02:12:03,934
<i>and felt uncomfortable</i>

1610
02:12:03,969 --> 02:12:07,832
<i>barging into somebody else's place
without asking.</i>

1611
02:12:09,457 --> 02:12:10,881
<i>It was strange,</i>

1612
02:12:11,645 --> 02:12:15,498
<i>but while we still searched
and called out Karli's name,</i>

1613
02:12:15,533 --> 02:12:18,654
<i>I already knew
our search was in vain.</i>

1614
02:12:19,319 --> 02:12:23,729
<i>Anyone who knew how devoted
the midwife was to her son,</i>

1615
02:12:23,973 --> 02:12:29,389
<i>knew she'd never have abandoned
her wounded Karli.</i>

1616
02:12:31,914 --> 02:12:33,646
<i>During the next few weeks,</i>

1617
02:12:33,681 --> 02:12:36,801
<i>the village gossips worked overtime.</i>

1618
02:12:37,423 --> 02:12:40,694
<i>Some claimed the doctor
was Karli's father.</i>

1619
02:12:41,020 --> 02:12:43,639
<i>He and the midwife
had tried to abort the child</i>

1620
02:12:43,674 --> 02:12:47,160
<i>so their relationship
wouldn't be found out,</i>

1621
02:12:47,393 --> 02:12:50,879
<i>and that's how
the child was disabled.</i>

1622
02:12:51,696 --> 02:12:53,536
<i>Some even claimed</i>

1623
02:12:53,571 --> 02:12:57,868
<i>that the death of the doctor's wife
was suspect,</i>

1624
02:12:57,903 --> 02:13:02,037
<i>and the two might very well
be responsible for it.</i>

1625
02:13:03,191 --> 02:13:05,148
<i>Better still, 
the doctor and the midwife,</i>

1626
02:13:05,149 --> 02:13:07,105
<i>as potential murderers,y</i>

1627
02:13:07,140 --> 02:13:11,485
<i>had also perpetrated
all the other crimes.</i>

1628
02:13:11,820 --> 02:13:14,658
<i>Wanting to spare
his legitimate children and himself</i>

1629
02:13:14,693 --> 02:13:17,670
<i>from public disclosure of his guilt,</i>

1630
02:13:17,705 --> 02:13:20,830
<i>the doctor had fled with them.</i>

1631
02:13:22,201 --> 02:13:26,514
<i>On July 28th,
Austria declared war on Serbia.</i>

1632
02:13:26,739 --> 02:13:30,830
<i>On Saturday, August 1st,
Germany declared war on Russia,</i>

1633
02:13:30,865 --> 02:13:33,789
<i>and on France the following Monday.</i>

1634
02:13:35,393 --> 02:13:39,714
<i>The solemn service next Sunday
was attended by the whole village.</i>

1635
02:13:39,887 --> 02:13:43,524
<i>A feeling of expectation
and departure was in the air.</i>

1636
02:13:43,829 --> 02:13:46,258
<i>Now everything was going to change.</i>

1637
02:13:46,862 --> 02:13:50,293
<i>Eva's father,
in the face of the coming war,</i>

1638
02:13:50,515 --> 02:13:52,618
<i>had taken his daughter back home,</i>

1639
02:13:52,619 --> 02:13:56,128
<i>and, at her pleading,
had come to Eichwald</i>

1640
02:13:56,432 --> 02:14:01,154
<i>where his future son-in-law lived
and worked, to look it over.</i>

1641
02:14:02,070 --> 02:14:06,106
<i>The prospect of soon calling
this beloved creature my wife</i>

1642
02:14:06,141 --> 02:14:09,289
<i>also made this a festive day for me.</i>

1643
02:14:10,143 --> 02:14:13,064
<i>The pastor never mentioned
our conversation again.</i>

1644
02:14:13,307 --> 02:14:17,901
<i>And apparently never went through
with his threat to denounce me.</i>

1645
02:14:18,892 --> 02:14:22,061
<i>I was drafted at the start of 1917.</i>

1646
02:14:22,331 --> 02:14:25,594
<i>After the war,
as my father had died meanwhile,</i>

1647
02:14:25,893 --> 02:14:27,975
<i>I sold his house in Vasendorf,</i>

1648
02:14:28,332 --> 02:14:32,345
<i>and with the money
opened a tailor's shop in town.</i>

1649
02:14:32,628 --> 02:14:35,295
<i>I never saw
any of the villagers again.</i>
