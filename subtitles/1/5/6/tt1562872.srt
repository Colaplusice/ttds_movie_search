00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,709
Will you marry me?

2
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,153
Kabit... please.

3
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,515
Okay.

4
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,158
Will you marry me, please?

5
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,515
Why are you doing this?

6
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,277
Because sooner or later we will.

7
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,834
We love each other.

8
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,829
Our families seem to tolerate each other.

9
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,878
I'm an architect
and you're an interior designer.

10
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,669
We're perfect.

11
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,149
What do you say?

12
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,635
Are you sure?

13
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,630
Natasha, please make it quick...

14
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,357
my knee is hurting.

15
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,430
Yes!

16
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,951
It seems like only yesterday
that Natasha came into this world.

17
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,669
And today she's getting engaged.

18
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,396
Kabir, I'm not losing a daughter.

19
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,919
I'm gaining a son.

20
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,675
You're so filmy, dad.

21
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,509
Excuse me!

22
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,191
Harryji

23
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,551
Two years ago you commissioned me to build your hotel.

24
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,393
Who would've imagined
that one day we'll be a big family.

25
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,837
On behalf of my family, I welcome you all.

26
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,230
Thank you so much.

27
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,270
Did you ever know that you're my hero

28
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,632
You're everything I wish I could be

29
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,191
I can fly like an eagle

30
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,628
Cause you're the wind beneath my wings

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,836
You're the wind beneath my wings

32
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,675
- That was lovely.

33
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,669
Wonderful.

34
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,150
Hello everyone.

35
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,354
I am Imran.Il

36
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,513
Kabir and I have been friends since school.

37
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,034
The three Musketeers!

38
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,238
That's right,
it was the name uncle had given the three of us.

39
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,555
The three Musketeers.

40
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,629
Unfortunately, the third musketeer...

41
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,631
Arjun is not with us anymore.

42
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,512
Don't worry, he's alive.
He just isn't here right now.

43
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,509
Anyway, Natasha...

44
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,633
Kabir is one of the nicest guys ever.

45
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,160
So, if you ever smash his BMW, don't worry.

46
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,595
Good excuse to get a new car.
- Absolutely.

47
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,440
He's also very intelligent.

48
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,836
So leave the kid's homework to him.

49
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,594
You're a true friend, thanks.

50
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,555
You're welcome,bro.

51
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,590
He's very large hearted.

52
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,951
So, don't think twice...

53
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,313
just buy those diamonds.

54
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,435
Okay.

55
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,314
Basically Natasha...

56
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,871
Kabir is a solid guy.

57
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,388
Put your hand in his and walk with him.

58
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,039
Because no matter what...

59
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,554
he will never let you down.

60
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,873
- So sweet.
- Hear, hear!

61
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,515
Thank you.

62
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,715
You can send the cheque now.

63
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,430
Tanya...

64
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,436
thank you.

65
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,674
Let me warn you...

66
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,348
Nikhil is planning a full power bachelor party.

67
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,510
Too late.

68
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,353
His school friends have planned a bachelor holiday.

69
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,509
A road trip...

70
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,550
through Spain.

71
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,951
- A road trip?
- Don't ask.

72
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,875
They had made some pact in college that...

73
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,952
each one would choose an adventure sport...

74
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,996
Are you serious?
Like Fear Factor?

75
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,629
Exactly!

76
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,075
And the other two would have to do it.

77
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,988
So, what have you picked?

78
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,953
That I can't say.

79
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,673
Not in front of me, at least.

80
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,676
You see...

81
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,036
the sport we pick is
a surprise for the other two.

82
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,675
Shut up!

83
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,113
- Seriously. - Are you kidding me?

84
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,589
No.

85
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,598
That ensures none of us back out.

86
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,158
Whose idea was this?

87
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,350
Mine.

88
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,717
Three weeks.

89
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,359
You know how these boys are.

90
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,391
Not Kabir.

91
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,394
Oh please!

92
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,273
All guys go crazy at bachelor parties.

93
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,515
In fact...

94
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,389
Nikhil still hasn't told me what happened at his.

95
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,550
I don't know.

96
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,034
I heard something
about your bachelor party.

97
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,635
Who told you?

98
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,715
So it is true.

99
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,596
Does Natasha know?

100
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,794
No man, why would I tell her?

101
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,553
Please... don't tell her.

102
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,430
She was from Ukraine.

103
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,199
- Bloody hot!
- Nice.

104
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,550
I was sloshed.

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,035
Okay, listen...

106
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,875
If Sameera finds out about this,
she'll kill me.

107
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,828
I know, don't worry.

108
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,117
It was my last night as a bachelor.
You know I'd never do it otherwise.

109
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,156
I understand, don't worry about it.

110
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,149
- Please. - It happens.

111
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,635
Sameera!

112
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,315
Sorry, I couldn't resist.

113
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,991
- Take care, man.
- See you.

114
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,713
Trust me, this trick never fails.

115
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,793
What do you mean?

116
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,430
well, you tell people you know something about them...

117
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,552
and before you know it,
they tell you their secrets.

118
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,959
Shut up!

119
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,190
you didn't know about the Ukrainian?

120
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,914
No, he just told me.

121
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,912
Mind blowing!

122
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,118
- Yeah, well time equals money, Simon.
You want money, stop wasting my time.

123
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,677
Sell 50,000 June contracts!

124
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,035
50,000 and don't screw up my stop losses this time!

125
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,076
How much?

126
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,508
Damn! That's horrendous!

127
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,719
Sell it. Sell everything.

128
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,555
Listen Joe,
if you continue to give me bullshit fills like that...

129
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,710
I'm going to have to trade my Ferrari in for a Ford Fiesta!

130
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,553
He doesn't like pink.

131
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,715
We have white and gold and...

132
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,639
tonnes of champagne.

133
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,796
And...

134
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,148
- the centre piece.
- This is Nice.

135
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,036
Finally!

136
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,316
Kabira!

137
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,358
Sorry man.

138
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,158
You have no idea what's happening here.

139
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,590
And you have no idea
what a nice party you missed.

140
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,555
I'm sure, man.

141
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,155
Listen...

142
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,794
I've a problem.

143
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,119
I can't make it to Spain.

144
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,552
- What?!

145
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,518
Arjun, you promised!

146
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,192
I am Imran.I know but....

147
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,237
i thought this deal I'm working on would come through...

148
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,991
- but I'm stuck.

149
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,512
I can't believe you're ditching me
on my bachelor trip.

150
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,635
It's not that...

151
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,073
- Then what is it?

152
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,755
We had decided to do this together.

153
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,954
If you can't make it, I'm calling it off.

154
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,715
Don't get sentimental.
It's my work!

155
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,358
I'm not.

156
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,193
It's been cancelled once before, so let's do it again.

157
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,599
I am Imran.It's fine..

158
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,349
It's either the three of us going or none at all.

159
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,589
Hey...

160
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,197
Hi.

161
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,077
How are you?

162
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,550
Good.

163
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,756
Looking good, you've been working out?

164
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:31,877
Yes.

165
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,913
I usually come in the morning.

166
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,077
I was going to call you.

167
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,949
Then why didn't you?

168
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,869
I'm getting married.

169
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,549
-That was quick.
- Arjun, please!

170
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,869
All the best, Rohini.

171
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,511
- Arjun, it's me again.

172
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,797
- Don't ditch me.

173
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,360
- I know why you're making excuses.

174
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,951
- But it's been four years for that incident.

175
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,915
- I'm getting married now.

176
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,190
- Even today, I only have two friends.

177
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,550
- We're the three Musketeers.
All for one, one for all.

178
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,232
Have you thought about...

179
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,595
what we spoke?

180
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,877
About what?

181
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,552
Are you moving back to Bombay?

182
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,275
Ammi...

183
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,078
I like Delhi and living on my own.

184
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,598
And this trip to Spain...

185
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,398
is it a coincidence or did you plan it?

186
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,950
Why don't you just say
what you're really thinking?

187
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,555
Fine.

188
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,272
Do you intend to meet Salman?

189
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,993
I don't know.

190
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,036
Imran, why don't you trust me?

191
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,596
It's not about you Ammi.

192
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,795
- He is my father.
- He's your father?

193
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,999
Has he ever called you or tried
to find out how you are?

194
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,071
Maybe he did and you kept it from me.

195
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,915
Until recently I wasn't even aware that he is my father.

196
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,395
Alright.

197
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,073
Do what you want.

198
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,514
But please remember this.

199
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,556
Faisal was your only father.

200
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,750
- Hello there.
- Hello.

201
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,713
I can see you.

202
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,711
I miss you, baby.

203
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,280
now we can see each other everyday.

204
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,949
I'm only going for three weeks, Natasha.

205
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,035
What will I do in London all alone?

206
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,591
You'll shop.

207
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,832
And in three weeks I'll come to London to carry your shopping bags.

208
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,911
- Very funny.
- I know.

209
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,433
Thank you.

210
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,790
So how many miles are we driving?
- We're on road for three weeks.

211
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,950
- I don't see Madrid in this plan.
- Because it's not there.

212
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,791
- We travel to Spain but
we're not going to see the capital?

213
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,950
- We don't have enough time.

214
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,598
- We can't change it now. - I think we should.

215
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,079
Look who's here!

216
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,715
- Welcome! How was your flight?
- Hello.

217
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,794
Well...

218
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,028
I am Imran.it flew..

219
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,555
Funny!

220
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,748
- Good to see you.
- You too.

221
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,829
I'm sorry about Abu.

222
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,432
I got your email.

223
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,192
- How's Ammi?
- She's fine.

224
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,955
It's not easy to get over these things.

225
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,509
How've you been?

226
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,596
I'm good.

227
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,079
Pretty good actually.

228
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,230
I've a new apartment. Three bedrooms, big space.

229
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,909
Nice.

230
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,275
I can't believe we're together again.

231
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,918
- Yeah. - Finally!

232
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,230
Should we sit?

233
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,117
So, here is the plan.

234
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,748
First...

235
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,433
we go to Costa Brava, which is my choice.

236
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,952
Then Arjun wants to go to Seville.

237
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,999
And then we'll head to... Sevia.

238
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,513
Pampalona which you've chosen.

239
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,750
Tomorrow morning we leave for Costa Brava.

240
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,719
What are you doing with the laptop?

241
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,599
I'm looking for an address.

242
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,715
Hola Kabira.

243
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,559
Kabira...
- Yes.

244
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,115
Your treasure.

245
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,992
Brilliant. Thanks a ton.

246
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,872
What have you done to this?

247
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,429
Dude!

248
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,109
First of all, be thankful that
I bought this 1 2,000 Euro bag for you!

249
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,996
What?

250
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,157
Here... show, show...

251
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,716
1 2,000 Euro for this purse?
- Yes.

252
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,513
Way more than your salary.

253
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,431
What?

254
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,033
Natasha loves these bags.

255
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,629
And I love cars, Kabir.

256
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,595
Always remember.

257
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,756
If you ever want to gift me an expensive car...

258
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,711
don't hesitate.

259
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,994
I am Imran.I won't.

260
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,512
Good.

261
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,509
Let's go.

262
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,919
I am Imran.I can't.

263
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,636
I need to make some calls.

264
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,356
I'll see you guys later.

265
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,113
Adios amigos.

266
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,595
- I thought this was a holiday.
- Me too.

267
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,792
Let's go.

268
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,075
We take the next right.

269
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,633
- Looks quite old.
- There it is.

270
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,749
There is the cathedral.

271
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,236
- Do you know where this place is?
- Yes, straight ahead.

272
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,118
How far is this gallery?

273
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,915
Shut up!

274
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,719
It's just here.

275
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,555
This is the street.
Catonia... whatever.

276
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,828
And that's the place.

277
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,114
I guess.

278
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,108
Hey!

279
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,593
Salman Habib.

280
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,914
It's a desi name.

281
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,592
He must be Pakistani or lndian.

282
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,236
Thanks.

283
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,272
I wish you'd come with us.

284
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,510
We walked all over looking for his gallery.

285
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,638
Man, this city is beautiful.

286
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,752
Well, today I made a 2,000 pound commission, so...

287
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,313
excuse me if I don't complain.

288
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,671
Cheers.

289
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,318
- 2,000 pounds?
- Yup!

290
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,117
Cheers.

291
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,635
Dude...

292
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,514
I heard something about you.

293
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,636
What?

294
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,829
You know what it is.

295
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,556
Mom told you?

296
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,550
Yes.

297
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,955
But did she tell you I was forced?

298
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,713
- Okay?
- Okay.

299
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,236
God man!
She can't keep anything to herself.

300
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,388
She's driving me crazy, man.

301
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,717
Yeah.

302
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,551
She came to london a few days ago.

303
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,516
And dragged me to some friend's relative's place.

304
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,555
To see a girl.

305
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,033
Neelu aunty and Gogi uncle's daughter Cookie.

306
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,273
I'd decided that I'd go, have some tea...

307
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,358
exchange pleasantries and decline the match.

308
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,551
As I took the first sip...

309
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,834
Cookie said 'no'!

310
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,555
So... you know...

311
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,717
What?!

312
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,551
I mean, so what! What is there?

313
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,710
What?

314
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,839
Come on, man!

315
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,435
You were set up for an arranged marriage...

316
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,595
and you got rejected?

317
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,989
But I didn't even try to create an impression.

318
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,911
- Now you're just saying it.
- I didn't want to impress her!

319
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,319
You've ruined our reputation.

320
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,194
Shut up, please stop it!

321
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,880
Why did she have to tell you?
What's wrong with her?

322
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,109
Actually, your mom said nothing.

323
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,510
It's his latest trick.
And you're his latest victim.

324
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,509
- Cheers!

325
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,675
2,000 pounds!

326
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,709
He's failed.
- Grow up, man!

327
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,359
How old are you?

328
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:39,837
You know what...

329
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,799
we have to have some shots.

330
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,189
- One for Cookie.
- We'll raise a toast to Cookie.

331
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,349
Okay.

332
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,712
Not for me.

333
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,312
I have a conference call in an hour.

334
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,272
Same old plan?

335
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,918
Mint money and retire at 40?

336
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,395
Yup!

337
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,350
That's the plan.

338
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,797
Listen...

339
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,835
thank you.

340
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,675
For what?

341
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,439
For coming on this trip.
It means a lot to me.

342
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,597
I'm sure it does.

343
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,513
Literacy is the key.

344
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,272
It's not that simple.

345
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,072
Oh - my - God!

346
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,512
Kabira, amazing choice.

347
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,679
She's gorgeous but she isn't ours.

348
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,509
What?

349
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,759
An SUV will be a lot comfortable.

350
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,359
To hell with the comfort.
Just look at her!

351
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,388
Guys?

352
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,393
- Hola, good morning. Your name?

353
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,355
- Kabir Dewan.
- Guys!

354
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,838
Kabir... Arjun...

355
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,714
She's beautiful.

356
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,878
I've booked an SUV
and they've charged me, sorry.

357
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,033
Sell Natasha's purse.

358
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,315
Funny.

359
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,148
Please!

360
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,120
What are you doing?
Behave yourself!

361
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,271
Oh, don't even think about it, dude.

362
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,514
All my life I sat in your car.

363
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,279
Now it's my turn.

364
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,757
What are you doing?

365
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,228
1 2,000 Euro. She rides first class.

366
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,753
Hey Sarah, what's up?
Mr. Yamamoto called?

367
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,670
Well, he'll have the docket in two days.

368
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,196
No, no don't say I'm on a holiday.
Just get Joe to call me back. Bye.

369
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,519
Hey Joe, what's up?

370
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,953
Like... 'now' now?

371
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,639
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'll do it, bye.

372
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,988
Sorry guys.

373
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,273
Guys... ten minutes tops!

374
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,954
Moshi moshi, Arjun-san.

375
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,358
Moshi moshi, Yamamoto-san.

376
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,317
How are you?

377
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,958
I'm fine, thank you.

378
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,553
Moshi, moshi?

379
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,948
It's Japanese for hello.

380
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,550
- I assure you, I will always be here for you.

381
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,639
Kabira...

382
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,312
Iook at this amazing view.

383
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,838
And, now look at our friend.

384
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,591
My team is going to put together all the information.

385
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,033
And you will have the docket with you in three days.

386
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,749
What happened to him, dude?

387
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,398
If you ask me...

388
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,272
he has become mentally sick.

389
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,628
And he needs the psychiatrist.

390
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,554
Isn't this from school?

391
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,034
Not school.

392
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,515
- Eschool!
- Eschool.

393
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,551
Eschool!

394
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,030
Because only the Mr.the Dubey can the talk like this.

395
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,591
The Mr. the Dubey.

396
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,037
Are you mentally challenged my buy?

397
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,555
Not buy.

398
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,876
bwoy.

399
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,075
- bwoy.

400
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,957
Mentally challenged my bwoy...

401
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,949
Mental bwoy.

402
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,956
Thank you, Mr. Yamamoto.

403
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,591
Let's go. I'm done.

404
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,749
Arjun, my bwoy...

405
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,198
you look the mental in this the uniform!

406
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,910
Let's go.

407
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,270
Okay, the very the well the saids.

408
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,352
Guys...

409
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,112
jjust do as I say.

410
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,958
It's been ten years since college.
Please grow up.

411
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,520
- Don't do this, please.
- Trust me.

412
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,636
You'll kiss me later.

413
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,759
When I shout...

414
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,991
point to the urinal and scream loudly.

415
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,148
Bye!

416
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,950
Dude, you're the mentally the sick!

417
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,868
People are the same everywhere.

418
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,598
It's just human nature.

419
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,037
What are you doing?

420
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,158
poor thing's feeling hot.

421
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,669
Poor thing?

422
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,034
Kabira...

423
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,429
meet Bagwati.

424
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,280
What's happened to your jokes?

425
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,715
Are they sick?

426
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,512
Well, they've taken after you.

427
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,194
Hey Joe, yes I spoke to Mr. Yamamoto and...

428
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,956
Somebody please throw his phone out.

429
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,589
What the...

430
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,755
- Are you mad?

431
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,949
Did you just...

432
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,670
You think we'll get it?

433
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,598
Sorry, I didn't think he would do it.

434
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,192
Of course you didn't know, Kabir.

435
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,554
Now go find my phone.

436
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,835
- Where?
- I don't know.

437
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,273
I want my phone, that's all.

438
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,390
It could've broken.

439
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,516
Arjun, don't be silly... we won't find it.

440
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,555
Silly?

441
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,275
You threw my phone out of a moving car, you moron!

442
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,230
He said it, I threw it.

443
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:43,718
Didn't you?

444
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,393
Kabir...

445
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,959
please tell me to slap him.

446
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,956
Don't be silly.

447
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,836
Just tell me to slap him.

448
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,548
Just tell me to slap him.

449
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,070
Slap him.

450
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,870
- What's wrong with you?
- Guys!

451
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,631
I'll get you a new phone.
I was just joking.

452
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,631
Well, it's not funny.

453
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,153
that call was important.

454
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,156
You think being 'cool and funny' gives you
the license to do anything?

455
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,676
It's always like,
'lmran said this. He's so funny.'

456
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,636
'lmran did that, he is so cool'.

457
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,789
Grow up!

458
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,791
throwing my phone out the window is not funny!

459
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,236
Hooking up with my girlfriend was not funny!

460
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,075
Listen...

461
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,158
it's been four years.

462
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,759
And I've apologised for it.

463
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,432
Now let it go.

464
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,513
Or what? Huh, what?

465
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,877
Stop it. Stop it, you two.

466
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,748
You're behaving like kids.

467
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,639
If there's a problem, deal with it.

468
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,516
Like adults.

469
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,914
Who made you the judge?

470
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,389
Do you see anyone else here?

471
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,071
I am Imran.Listen..

472
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,953
Let's get this straight.

473
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,154
I don't have any problem with him.

474
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,950
Why would you have a problem?

475
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,393
Sonali was my girlfriend.

476
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,238
Come on, Sonali and me fell in love.

477
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,999
It happens. Shit happens.

478
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,397
Yeah.

479
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,436
It was shit.

480
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,276
For me.

481
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,630
And I'm sure you didn't give it a second thought.

482
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,074
Imran man...

483
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,270
I would never do that to you.

484
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,436
Arjun...

485
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,150
I screwed up.
Now what do you want me to do?

486
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,510
What do I do?

487
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,919
Should I wear a 'Sorry, Arjun' t-shirt and walk around?

488
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:20,917
What should I do?

489
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,197
Just look at him.

490
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,914
Listen to me, okay.
You two, please!

491
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,515
Sonali was a bitch.

492
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,111
Understand?

493
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,554
I'm sorry, really.

494
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,438
She used you.

495
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,828
Then gave you a BpL and used him.

496
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,554
And she dumped you as well.

497
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,635
She was a waste of time then
and she is a waste of time now.

498
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,791
Four years ago we cancelled this trip because of her.

499
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,872
Today we're here for me.
Don't let her ruin this.

500
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,990
Please!

501
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,352
How many times do I have to apologise?

502
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,711
How many times?
Let's just make it clear.

503
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,909
Till it doesn't come from here.

504
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,909
What's BpL?

505
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,710
Bum Pe Laat.
[Kick in the arse.]

506
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,115
You're crazy.

507
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,554
Speak with him. He slapped me.

508
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,830
Get married.
- What!

509
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,989
I can't believe this.

510
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,033
Hi baby...

511
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,831
Good.

512
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,632
We've left Barcelona.

513
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,113
On the road.

514
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,672
Yes, it's beautiful.

515
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,758
Of course, they're with me.
Where will they go?

516
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,393
Everything is cool.

517
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,595
Yeah.

518
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,597
All ready.

519
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,715
Come on.

520
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,269
Yes!

521
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,793
Now this is a house.

522
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,518
- I like.
- Cool.

523
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,748
It's Lovely.

524
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,637
You haven't seen the half of it yet.

525
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,435
Can we slide?

526
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,676
No, you can't.

527
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,628
- Captain.
-Amazing.

528
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,789
Wow, man!

529
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,198
This is nicer than the pictures.

530
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,590
Amazing.

531
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,555
What a view!

532
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,954
Someday.

533
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,714
How was it?

534
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,516
Refreshing.

535
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,672
Who is she?

536
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,909
How should I know, dude?

537
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,429
She's nice.

538
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,279
Really nice.

539
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,314
What's happening?

540
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,792
She's got me.
She's pulling me towards her.

541
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,276
She's pulling me.

542
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,588
I saw her first.

543
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,229
So true.

544
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,120
But has she seen you?

545
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,637
What?

546
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,949
- Hola.
- Hola.

547
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:15,991
Can I try that?

548
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,317
Yeah.

549
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,597
Thanks.

550
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,913
Where are you from?

551
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,591
I am Imran.Brazill?

552
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,154
Half US, half lndia.

553
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,676
India?

554
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,552
What a coincidence!
Which part?

555
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,509
My dad's from Delhi but I live in London.

556
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,153
Hindi? Not bad!

557
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,711
You too... wow!

558
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,718
If you're free, want to join me for a drink?

559
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,115
I have an early morning.

560
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,190
Sorry.

561
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,035
Thanks.

562
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,197
Bye.

563
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,238
What's your name?

564
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,070
Laila.

565
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,311
Imran.

566
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,639
But my friends call me 'Romeo'.

567
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,994
Romeo?

568
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,355
Seriously man... Romeo?

569
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,999
I mean, chee!

570
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,231
Arjun...

571
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,356
It's a man's duty to try.

572
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,799
Success and failure are in His hands.

573
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,792
Great, professor.

574
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,754
Seriously?

575
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,872
You got me this time!

576
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,551
What the hell is this?

577
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,669
What?

578
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,633
This! What the hell is this?

579
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,110
You said I had to get you a new phone.

580
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,348
You didn't specify which one.

581
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,313
I'm a trader.

582
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,594
Not a Japanese school girl.

583
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,270
Moshi moshi.

584
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,517
Shut up, just shut up!

585
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,320
- Just don't talk to me.
- Guys that's enough!

586
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,271
Look at this. What's wrong with him?

587
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,276
What's wrong with you?

588
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,953
It's funny.

589
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,274
Anyway, now listen.

590
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,838
why we are here in Costa Brava.

591
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,996
Ready for this?

592
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,397
Yeah.

593
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,348
Deep... sea...

594
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,676
diving.

595
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,316
What?

596
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,315
Yes, our training begins first thing tomorrow.

597
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,512
I'm sorry but...

598
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,715
why is this turning into a 'let's-torture-Arjun' holiday?

599
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,153
I jjust don't understand.

600
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,752
Relax, I know.

601
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,637
I spoke with the people at the diving school.

602
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,756
You don't need to know how to swim.

603
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,591
At least you know how to drown.

604
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,148
Listen, just keep quiet. Just...

605
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,309
keep quite.

606
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,031
Kabir...

607
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,595
I don't understand
how you thought I'll do this.

608
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,869
What's wrong with you?

609
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,554
Bathroom... to the left.

610
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,589
Okay, listen.

611
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,713
I know you're scared of water.

612
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,072
Okay.

613
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,552
But then that's the challenge.
And it's completely safe.

614
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,313
Think about it.

615
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,753
Blue waters... okay?

616
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,677
Fish swimming close to you.

617
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,508
Corals...

618
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,115
It'll be amazing.

619
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,592
Look, if you're not comfortable,
no one's going to force you.

620
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,591
No, I'm serious, it's okay.

621
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,553
Okay. Fine.

622
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,118
Kabir Dewan?

623
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,189
Laila?

624
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,552
Hey.

625
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,159
Hi, what are you doing here?

626
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,358
Following you, I guess.

627
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,956
Really?

628
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,635
No.

629
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,037
I'm here to train you.

630
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,150
I'm an instructor here.

631
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,430
Wow!

632
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,595
- Hi, I'm Kabir.
- Laila.

633
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,828
- This is Arjun. - Hi.

634
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,511
Laila.

635
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,357
Romeo?

636
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,031
You remember?

637
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,639
Arjun...

638
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,916
If you don't want to dive, it's totally fine.

639
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,595
He can't swim.

640
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,553
It's okay, doesn't matter.

641
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,035
You'll be fine.

642
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,517
Thank you.

643
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,029
Shall we start?

644
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,510
Let's go.

645
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,236
It's a little difficult to talk under water.

646
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,673
For obvious reasons.

647
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,638
So these signs are very important.

648
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,790
Up.

649
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,673
Down.

650
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,554
Okay.

651
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,510
Not okay.

652
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,109
Air gauge.

653
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,591
Okay?

654
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,316
Okay?

655
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,350
Alright!

656
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,518
You have to wear a wet suit.

657
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,315
The water is pretty cold.

658
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,518
Next is the BCD.
Your buoyancy control device.

659
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,835
All okay?

660
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,680
These weights will help you remain underwater.

661
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,391
Finally, your fins.

662
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,999
Cheers. Salute.

663
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,876
Good job boys.

664
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,199
So, when is the wedding?

665
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,995
In two months.

666
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,274
We only started dating about six months ago.

667
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,794
Well, you know what they say...

668
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,915
when it's right, it's right.

669
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,349
That's what I said.

670
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,676
Actually, she said it.

671
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,670
What does she do?

672
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,997
Interior design.
And she's bloody good.

673
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,510
Okay.

674
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,238
And of course, her father has a hotel business...

675
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,594
that's evaluated at...

676
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,429
Ten billion?

677
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,596
Ten billion.

678
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,593
I'm not marrying her for her money.

679
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,597
Kabir, of course not.

680
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,636
But you've got to admit,
it's a plus point.

681
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,715
Plus point? Are you serious?

682
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,788
Would you marry for money?

683
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,629
Depends.

684
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,836
How much?

685
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,949
Ten billion!

686
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,796
Definitely.

687
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,670
And what if she's a bore?

688
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,517
When you have ten billion in your bank
who needs the wife for entertainment?

689
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,836
- Romantic.
- I agree, it's true.

690
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,679
- Cheers!

691
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,709
Are you seeing someone?

692
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,395
Do you have a girlfriend?

693
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,955
No.

694
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,915
Hey... what about Rohini?
What happened there?

695
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,990
- She was nice.
- Well...

696
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,230
I guess she wanted different things out of life.

697
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,875
Laila...

698
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,637
apart from my body what else do you want out of life?

699
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,710
I don't know.
I haven't really made a list.

700
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:10,835
Still...

701
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,432
there must be something.

702
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,551
I guess, I want that...

703
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,189
Iife should continue to surprise me.

704
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,914
Inspire me.

705
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,559
Make me meet new people.

706
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,390
I am Imran.ola..

707
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,516
Hola.

708
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,516
- Hola.
- Hola?

709
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,149
Sorry.

710
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,233
Give me new experiences.

711
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,835
And...

712
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,109
I want...

713
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,635
you to get me a drink.

714
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,229
Your wish is my command.

715
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,839
- One for me, please.
- Arjun?

716
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,595
I'm okay.

717
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,832
- Keep it down.
- Guys we're gonna get arrested.

718
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,758
Its gonna to be fun.

719
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,832
He's here. Quiet.

720
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,993
Crazy.

721
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,598
I was just telling...

722
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,954
that's the problem you see.

723
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,709
Guys, watch out..

724
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,789
Sorry.

725
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,757
Your life is about to change.

726
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,549
That's if I survive!

727
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,714
We'll see.

728
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,679
Yup, we'll see.

729
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,714
The moment flows by like molten sapphire

730
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,350
Deep blue silences

731
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,078
No earth below, no sky above

732
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,557
The rustling branches and leaves

733
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,915
Are saying only you are here

734
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,509
Only me

735
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,636
My breath and my heartbeat

736
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,958
Such depth, such solitude

737
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,198
And me

738
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,550
Only me

739
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,594
I now believe I exist

740
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,672
Baby, it was amazing.
You should definitely do it.

741
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,718
I have no interest.

742
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,190
Hey!

743
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:58,757
Hey...

744
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,440
Sorry. Can I use your loo?
Imran is taking a shower.

745
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,350
Sure.

746
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:03,910
Who is that?

747
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,628
Wait. First say hi to Natasha.

748
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,075
Okay.

749
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,797
Hey... I'm Laila.

750
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,231
Hi.

751
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,790
Kabir has told me a lot about you.

752
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,313
Congratulations in advance.

753
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,636
Thanks.

754
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,111
Well, it's really nice to meet you.

755
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,836
- Bye.
- Bye.

756
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,669
Who is that?

757
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,714
That's Laila, our instructor.

758
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,312
She's studying fashion in London but...

759
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,198
three months a year she works
at dive sites around the world.

760
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,394
I am Imran.Isn't that cooll?

761
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,196
Very Cool.

762
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,952
what is she doing in your room?

763
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,628
She's using the bathroom.

764
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,794
Imran invited her over for dinner.

765
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,995
Iebrate our fiirst diive..

766
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,629
D'you think I'm stupid?

767
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,677
What? It's the truth.

768
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,795
Arjun is cooking.

769
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,275
Yeah, you must be very busy.
I'll speak to you later.

770
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,598
Natasha, why are you getting upset?

771
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,950
I'm not upset.
I've a flight to catch.

772
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,073
You're being really silly.

773
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,269
Yeah, I know. Bye.

774
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,669
Bye.

775
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,758
- All okay?
- Yeah, fine.

776
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,231
- See you downstairs.
- See you.

777
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,510
Need some help?

778
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,351
Nope. Almost done.

779
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,513
Paella.

780
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,430
- Yup. - Very nice.

781
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:36,910
Thanks.

782
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,155
So...

783
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,598
you didn't tell me how it was.

784
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,555
Thank you.

785
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,958
Don't thank me.
You did it.

786
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,518
So, how was it?

787
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,159
It was magical.

788
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,874
It felt like the most peaceful place on earth.

789
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,709
It was beautiful.

790
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,675
I was 1 6 when I did my first dive.

791
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,158
And then stopping myself was impossible.

792
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,797
Yeah, it could be addictive.

793
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,110
Addictive?

794
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,789
No.

795
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,759
Addiction is such a negative word.

796
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:27,555
Diving is...

797
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,509
something else for me.

798
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,792
It's like meditation.

799
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:37,119
You're conscious of every breath, every moment.

800
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,239
Just imagine...

801
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,515
Iiving your whole life like that.

802
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,635
Be fully alive to each and every moment.

803
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,676
Delicious.

804
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,590
- Seriously.
- Thank you.

805
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,749
You should cook more often.

806
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,235
I know man but...

807
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,550
where's the time!

808
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,670
So, the fear of water still there?

809
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,675
Now there's no fear.

810
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,795
Not even of life.

811
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,560
Wow! In one dunk you've unravelled the mystery of life!

812
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:10,791
Well done, my lad.

813
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,432
Actually, it's quite simple.

814
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:16,515
What is it?

815
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,115
Just...

816
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,355
keep breathing.

817
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,988
Laila!

818
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,228
Finally, our old friend has surfaced.

819
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,236
And to avoid a relapse...

820
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,630
why don't you join us on the trip?

821
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,628
I'd love to.

822
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,119
But I'm off to Bunol tomorrow.

823
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,914
It's the Tomatina festival.

824
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:44,996
- Too bad!
- Is it?

825
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,991
Toma-tina, what's that?

826
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,353
Arjjun!

827
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,637
How can you not know that...

828
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,030
it is the world's largest tomato fight?!

829
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,953
It's like our festival of colours.
But played with tomatoes instead.

830
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,949
Really?

831
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,633
Actually, you guys should come.

832
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,629
I am Imran.It'lil be a blast..

833
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:05,632
I'm in.

834
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,189
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm in.

835
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,872
What? No!

836
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,188
We're leaving for Seville tomorrow.

837
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,872
That's perfect.
Bunol is en-route.

838
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,509
- Come on.

839
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,034
Look, Seville is Arjun's choice.

840
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,909
He made the reservations.

841
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,598
To mess with Arjun's reservations is...

842
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,039
Iike inviting Death!

843
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,156
Come on.

844
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,794
Alright, let me see what I can do.

845
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,828
Is that your phone?

846
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,069
It's a long story.

847
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:52,949
Let's not go there.

848
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,399
No, it's nice.

849
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,799
He's very much in touch with his feminine side.

850
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,835
Eat your food.

851
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,599
Don't worry, even I like pink.

852
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,828
Great, I feel much better. Thank you.

853
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,154
How could you do this?

854
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,630
Rohini, I'm really sorry but...

855
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,232
can't you see that this deal could help me.

856
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,992
Can't you see that maybe I don't care!

857
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,388
You don't care.

858
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,550
- you don't care about my life? - Stop it, Arjun.

859
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,028
Don't confuse your work with your life.

860
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,357
Your work isn't your life.
It's just a part of it.

861
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,592
Just like this relationship is a part of your life.

862
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,716
- What about this?
- What about this?

863
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,634
I bought this apartment
so that we could live together.

864
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,597
What? please!

865
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:40,957
You bought this apartment to impress people
with your up market address.

866
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,552
I can't believe you just said that.

867
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,791
- I'm planning a future with you.
- Our future will come tomorrow, Arjun.

868
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,916
- Don't scream!
- Where is our today?

869
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,114
Don't scream.

870
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,269
Then liisten to me..

871
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:53,589
What do you want?

872
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,639
I want to spend time with you.

873
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:59,349
I want a relationship.
Not a retirement plan.

874
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,759
Please, Rohini.

875
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,995
The chairman of Nakatomi Corporation
wants a meeting with me.

876
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,638
What do I do?
I have to go.

877
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,989
If the presentation does it,
he'll give us the entire account.

878
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,548
That will boost my career.

879
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,993
Can't you see that?

880
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,274
What about our deal?

881
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,960
We can go next month.

882
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,592
It's my birthday, Arjun.

883
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,558
- I know.
- It won't come next month.

884
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:31,713
You had promised that
we would go to ltaly no matter what.

885
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,955
And you cancelled the tickets
without even talking to me.

886
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,597
Rohini, I really am sorry.

887
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,750
please understand.
Just a second.

888
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,117
It's an important call.
Just one second.

889
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,753
Rohini, one second. Hello...

890
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,355
Yes, Alex...

891
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,511
I'll be there in ten minutes.

892
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:22,518
Hey babe, I guess you're on the plane.

893
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:27,594
I called to say that we're going to
Bunol tomorrow, for the Tomatina festival

894
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,591
Laila is taking us.

895
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,599
Please don't be upset.

896
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:37,110
Please call when you get this message.
I love you.

897
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,874
Where the hell is he?

898
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,389
Oh - my - God!

899
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:04,639
- I love it.
- Unbelievable!

900
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,517
- Okay.
- Yes?

901
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,555
- Can I drive?
- No.

902
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,709
Kabira...

903
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,596
if four days of diving can do this to you.

904
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,160
Trust me, you should stay under water.

905
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,358
Who knows if I'll be with you guys again...

906
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,635
I decided, it's all or bust!

907
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,198
- Right?
- Correct.

908
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,396
Dude, you're getting married.

909
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,516
You're not going to prison.

910
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,589
Thanks..

911
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,555
All set?

912
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,915
- Arjun...

913
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,429
can you help me?

914
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,188
- It's to the right.
- It's jammed, what did you do?

915
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:37,871
I am Imran.Dude!.

916
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,358
You have to apply some force.

917
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,198
No, just for the drive.

918
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,714
- Hi.
- Hello.

919
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,675

920
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,548
Relax in the front seat.

921
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,993
Driver... Bunol..

922
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,558
So Lailaji,
hale and hearty both packed in the bag?

923
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,235
No, thanks.

924
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,238
What are you doing?

925
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,270
Laila, meet Bagwati.

926
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,953
Hi Bagwati.

927
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,157
Bagwati thinks you are very beautiful.

928
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,279
Thank you, Bagwati.

929
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,558
The evening was hazy...

930
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,115
The mood was sad...

931
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,713
A thousand memories vanished as they came...

932
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,392
That's really nice.

01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,349
- Really?
- Thanks man.

937
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,594

Laila...

991
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,238
your friend is very cute.

992
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,194
Is that so?

993
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,713
You've already forgotten me?!

994
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,149
You're pathetic!

Laila...

Okay listen guys, there are two rules.

998
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,591
You have to make way for the trucks.

999
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,875
And squash the tomatoes before throwing them.

1000
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,589
Otherwise it hurts.

1001
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,352
Alright? Let's go!

1002
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,669
- Kabira, squash it.
- Did it hurt?

1003
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,628
- Of course.
- Shit man!

1004
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,714
What are you guys doing?
There are rules.

1005
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,599
Have you ever followed a rule in your life?
You bastard, now you want rules!

1006
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,749
Come here!

1007
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:05,591
Come here I'll tell you the rules.

1008
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,039
Come on!

1009
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,269
Ooh aah..
take the world and paint it red

1010
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,591
Ooh aah.. paint it red

1011
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,869
Ooh aah.. paint it red

1012
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:39,111
Ooh aah.. paint it red

1013
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,351
There's a passion, a madness

1014
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:45,434
All around

1015
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:50,150
A carefree gladness

1016
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,988
All around

1017
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:58,315
Somewhere lightly, the colours fall

1018
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,836
Stories of yesterday, you can't recall

1019
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,914
Someone softly tells my heart

1020
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,913
Give yourself away, let the magic start

1021
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,629
Ooh aah.. take the world and paint it red

1022
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,110
Ooh aah.. take the world and paint it red

1023
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,194
Ooh aah.. take the world and paint it red

1024
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,431
Ooh aah.. take the world and paint it red

1025
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:30,510
An obsession. A passion.
Everywhere, everywhere.

1026
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:38,070
A trance. A trance. A trance.
Everywhere, everywhere.

1027
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:58,829
This moment that's so whole
Seems high on its own

1028
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,310
This moment unveils its intoxication on you

1029
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:06,349
Now you're in the mood
You hold hands with the groove

1030
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:09,750
As voices blend in with the hues

1031
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:15,198
And we go on and on and on and on.

1032
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:23,276
And we go on and on and on and on.

1033
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:29,029
The colors of life splash aloud.

1034
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:32,795
Just put the past behind you.

1035
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,634
Someone softly speaks from my heart.

1036
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,759
Let the spell take over you.

1037
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:44,355
Ooh aah.. take the world and paint it red

1038
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,796
Ooh aah.. take the world and paint it red

1039
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,948
Ooh aah.. take the world and paint it red

1040
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:55,191
Ooh aah.. take the world and paint it red

1041
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,629
Ooh aah.. take the world and paint it red

1042
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:18,076
Ooh aah.. take the world and paint it red

1043
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,188
Ooh aah.. take the world and paint it red

1044
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:25,272
Ooh aah.. take the world and paint it red

1045
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,709
Ooh aah.. take the world and paint it red

1046
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:33,076
Ooh aah.. take the world and paint it red

1047
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,229
Ooh aah.. take the world and paint it red

1048
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:40,437
Ooh aah.. take the world and paint it red

1049
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,516
I'm feeling cold now.

1050
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,108
And it's stinking too.

1051
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,515
You're going to get this.

1052
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,394
- She's going to get it.
- put me down!

1053
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,276
Kabir?

1054
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,149
Natasha?

1055
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,356
What are you doing?

1056
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,516
Hi...

1057
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,831
I came here to surprise you.

1058
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,672
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

1059
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:31,630
I am happy.

1060
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:32,709
Yeah, you look it.

1061
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:34,870
Natasha...

1062
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,953
this is my bachelor trip.

1063
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,758
And you know,
I want to spend this time with my friends.

1064
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,671
Really? Laila is your friend?

1065
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:46,198
She's our diving instructor.
I told you on the phone.

1066
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,872
And the other one... Nancy?

1067
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,351
Nuria.

1068
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,793
Whatever!!.

1069
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,320
Oh God, Natasha!
I just met her this morning!

1070
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:58,915
She was kind enough to give us her room.
We'll probably never see each other again!

1071
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,391
That's just perfect!

1072
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,231
No one will ever know what happened.

1073
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,877
Is that why you are here?

1074
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,631
The apology on the phone was
just an excuse to get the address.

1075
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,832
How dare you, Kabir?

1076
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,273
- That's really mature...
- Shut up!

1077
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,716
Who is it?

1078
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:18,751
Imran.

1079
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,109
Come in.

1080
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,394
- Hi.
- Hey.

1081
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,277
I'm sorry, I jjust need my bag.

1082
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,592
Don't apologise, it's totally cool.

1083
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:29,715
Thanks.

1084
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:37,716
Thanks.

1085
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,151
We've made dinner plans,
would you like to join us?

1086
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,638
- Actually...
- Yes.

1087
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,312
Definitely, sounds like fun.

1088
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,838
Okay, I'll call when we're heading out.

1089
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:53,835
We don't have to go.

1090
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,070
I don't want your friends to think I'm a witch!

1091
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,319
Witch alert!

1092
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,193
Our holiday is in danger.

1093
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:03,756
Who is next?

1094
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,718
Even I love you very much.

1095
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,394
Dude, I can't believe Natasha's here.

1096
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:19,589
I'm shocked!

1097
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,635
Why? What's the big deal?

1098
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:23,988
Laila...

1099
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:27,999
your fiancee can't crash your bachelor party.
That's the only rule!

1100
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:29,436
Rule?

1101
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,030
- You guys are so stupid.
- What?

1102
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,833
Stupid?

1103
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:35,716
You're stupid.

1104
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,391
Natasha hates you.

1105
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:39,750
What?

1106
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:41,398
Yes, she said...

1107
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,873
Is Laila your friend?

1108
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:43,950
She asked you that?

1109
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:47,353
No, she asked Kabir.
I was eavesdropping outside the door.

1110
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,839
There that Natasha.

1111
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,069
Of course.
- Here these tomatoes.

1112
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,518
How do you say,
'can I come in', in Spanish?

1113
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,315
Dude, what're you doing?
Don't be stupid!

1114
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,030
Yes?

1115
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,999
See you in the lobby.

1116
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:45,839
I want to learn Flamenco.
It looks like so much fun.

1117
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,593
Laila, you live in Spain?

1118
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,279
No, in London.

1119
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:52,834
So does Arjun.

1120
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:54,437
Yeah.

1121
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,748
Kabir and I will be there after this holiday.

1122
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:58,988
We should definitely get together.

1123
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,919
Yeah, we should.

1124
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:03,832
I'd love to but I'm off to Morocco from here..

1125
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,239
For a month.

1126
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:06,515
Wow!

1127
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,594
I think all of you should come to Seville with us.

1128
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,309
I'm going back to London tomorrow.

1129
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,591
You only came here for a day?

1130
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,191
Yeah..

1131
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,750
Kabir wants to hang with the two of you.

1132
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,999
I don't want to disturb your plans.

1133
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,878
Don't be silly, Natasha.
You're hardly a disturbance.

1134
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,390
- That's really sweet, lmran.
Thank you.

1135
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,876
But, Kabir said it's a miracle to get you two together.

1136
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,637
And you have to attend the wedding.
No excuses.

1137
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:37,749
1 00 percent!

1138
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:39,355
Of course!

1139
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:41,949
Excuses...

1140
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,396
Could we get the more the red the wines?

1141
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,594
Arjun, the translation into the Espanols?

1142
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:53,875
Imran, please!

1143
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:58,158
It's because of such behaviour
that lndians have a bad reputation.

1144
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,274
Will you please tell him?

1145
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,629
Imran, don't do it.

1146
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:05,755
Chee!

1147
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,074
What chee?
He is right!

1148
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,758
I agree with you.
Imran, it's wrong.

1149
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:12,954
I am Imran.No..

1150
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,075
I'm the very the sorry

1151
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:16,750
No, I'm sorry.

1152
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:17,636
Not Funny!

1153
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,956
- Been to Morocco?
- Morocco? No!

1154
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,439
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

1155
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:28,988
Let's go?

1156
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,399
It's amazing.

1157
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:31,669
In a bit.

1158
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,915
Moshi moshi.

1159
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,636
- Will you do me a favour?
- No way!

1160
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:41,876
Why don't you both take a long walk?

1161
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,790
Dude, it's late, we're tired.
You must be tired.

1162
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,791
- You must be tired.
- No, not really.

1163
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,234
That's the spirit.
The night is young.

1164
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,390
You two aren't that old either!

1165
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,511
I'm sure you'll come up with some plan.

1166
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:03,035
- You sure?
- Come on.

1167
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,231
Shit! I forgot my phone.

1168
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,755
Aren't you on a holiday?

1169
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,829
And, you are absolutely right.

1170
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,115
Do you have a boyfriend?

1171
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:56,830
No.

1172
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:57,590
Really?

1173
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,430
Why not?

1174
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,791
You see, the guys I liked...

1175
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,917
wanted diffrent things out of life.

1176
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,993
What kind of guys do you like?

1177
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:14,559
What's your type?

1178
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:15,913
I don't have a type.

1179
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,548
Come on, everyone has a type.

1180
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:19,759
Really?

1181
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:23,835
Like I know, a guy who gets
only three weeks off in a year...

1182
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,068
isn't your type.

1183
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,799
He can't be anyone's type.

1184
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,195
He has no time.

1185
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:31,792
He is a slave.

1186
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:35,634
And one who only thinks of his career,
isn't your type either.

1187
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,791
If he only thinks about his career,
then he is a bore.

1188
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,878
Or someone who thinks money
is the most important thing in life.

1189
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,119
Like you!

1190
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,676
You don't know anything about me.

1191
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:52,915
So?

1192
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,754
So, don't judge me.

1193
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:00,671
I wasn't judging you.

1194
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,597
I'm merely asking...

1195
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,319
does money really make you happy?

1196
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,710
I was eight when my dad passed away.

1197
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,831
Leaving behind a huge debt for my mother.

1198
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,155
Very early I understood that...

1199
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,790
only money makes the world go round.

1200
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,313
Simple as that.

1201
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,799
- I understand, Arjun.

1202
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,229
But you still haven't answered my question.

1203
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:34,794
Yes, money makes me happy.

1204
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,592
Then why did you cry, the other day...

1205
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:39,875
after the dive?

1206
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,839
Has a paycheque ever brought tears to your eyes?

1207
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:47,233
- No,

1208
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,113
Think about it.

1209
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,513
When you've done so well in life...

1210
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,919
are you really happy?

1211
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,755
Even today if you feel something is missing...

1212
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,831
what is it?

1213
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,195
Take time out for things that...

1214
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:07,156
give you genuine joy.

1215
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,554
Like cooking.

1216
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,391
Well, that's the plan, I mean...

1217
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,272
I'll retire at 40 and...

1218
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,235
I am Imran.Dude!!.

1219
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,194
How do you know if you'll be alive till then?

1220
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,711
Seize the day, my friend.

1221
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:23,188
First, live this day to the fullest.

1222
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,792
Then think about 40.

1223
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:34,197
Come on.

1224
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,553
My friends don't know
why I made them come here.

1225
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,435
I want to meet Salman Habib.

1226
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,672
I've never met him.

1227
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,239
I have never met my father.

1228
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,352
What if he doesn't want to meet me?

1229
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:48,831
Why are we lying here?

1230
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:53,228
I mean, it's ridiculous.

1231
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:54,639
No.

1232
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:57,951
It's ridiculous that
you've never done this before.

1233
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:00,835
What to do?

1234
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,830
I'm stuck with a beautiful home in London.

1235
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,912
Only someone who has never slept
under the stars...

1236
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,070
can say something so stupid.

1237
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:15,915
Wow man.

1238
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,153
I should learn from you.

1239
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:26,872
I feel like I've spent my life in a box.

1240
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:30,912
But you...

1241
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,838
you are free.

1242
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:40,832
You're free, Laila.

1243
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,074
Arjun...

1244
01:20:47,240 --> 01:20:51,074
The only time a man should be in a box...

1245
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,036
is when he's dead.

1246
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,559
Natasha, stay for a few more days.

1247
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:19,829
You don't mean that.

1248
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,354
No, I do.

1249
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,238
I don't like it that you're so sad.

1250
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,159
What do you expect?

1251
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,909
How would you feel if
I just left you and took off with my friends?

1252
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,599
You have your own life.

1253
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:34,719
And if you and Sameera
ever decide to go on a trip...

1254
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,674
why would I stop you?

1255
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:39,957
And if I told you that
we've met some guys...

1256
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:42,349
and made dinner plans with them, then?

1257
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:43,829
Then what?

1258
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:44,956
Then what?

1259
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,631
I trust you.

1260
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,791
Of course I'd want you both to be safe...

1261
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,793
but besides that, I won't suspect you.

1262
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,109
I'm sorry, but it's easier said than done.

1263
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:57,917
Babe...

1264
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,637
you're welcome to stay if you want to.

1265
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:04,359
But if you don't,
I'll drive you to the airport tomorrow.

1266
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:08,430
Good night.

1267
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,755
- I'll miss you.
- Take care.

1268
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,677
- Stay in touch.
See you at the wedding.

1269
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,193
- lmran, can you help me?
- Of course.

1270
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,599
For sure. Okay?

1271
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:30,192
- Email me.
- I will.

1272
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:30,950
Good luck.

1273
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,195
Hey...

1274
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,038
Yesterday was...

1275
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,189
I jus..

1276
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,758
I had the best time yesterday.

1277
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,349
Me too.

1278
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,997
And good luck...

1279
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,355
for your upcoming adventures.

1280
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,794
Thanks.

1281
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,515
I'll see you.

1282
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:19,397
Bye.

1283
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:24,115
Bye.

1284
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:25,550
Ciao.

1285
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,398
A thought came alive, but away it hid

1286
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:55,073
It stole a glance, from under the eyelids

1287
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:59,438
Sometimes from you, sometimes from me
it asked for words to set it free

1288
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:05,590
Words to wear, so from the lips it can flee

1289
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,036
A voice it can embrace and sway with glee

1290
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:14,068
But this thought
Is a feeling... just a feeling

1291
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,836
Like a fragrance floating in the breeze

1292
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,836
A fragrance that is unspeaking

1293
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,360
You live with it

1294
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,430
I am Imran.I'm aware of iit.

1295
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,991
Out in the open for the world to see

1296
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,355
What is this unknown mystery?

1297
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:02,989
Who is it?

1298
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,429
Laila?

1299
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,153
You'll forgot something?

1300
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,671
I hate regrets.

1301
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,832
Then you shouldn't have any.

1302
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,909
Bye.

1303
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:38,592
Flying away in the open sky...

1304
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:42,718
Are the birds of my dreams

1305
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:48,393
Flying away...

1306
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:53,710
To the land of my heart
are the birds of my dreams

1307
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:04,392
Don't know where they'll go next

1308
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:12,674
Wings have taken flight and now
says my sight you've finally awoken

1309
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:18,233
What was on your mind is left behind
You've moved far ahead in time

1310
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:24,194
Life is floating on a breeze

1311
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:29,874
Life is telling you and me

1312
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:37,676
Now whatever will be will be

1313
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:51,318
Flying away in the open sky are
the birds of my dreams

1314
01:28:53,320 --> 01:29:02,797
Flying away.. to the land of my heart are
the birds of my dreams

1315
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:13,638
Don't know where they'll go next

1316
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:20,672
A touch from someone and
I've been wandering without a thought

1317
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:26,989
Somewhere new words were spoken
and since then I've been lost

1318
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:32,028
Something made the heart melt

1319
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:37,675
In a blink, I was someone else

1320
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:45,152
Now whatever will be will be

1321
01:29:54,800 --> 01:30:03,037
A light shone down
Now there's a beauty being showered on the streets

1322
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:14,629
Happiness came down
Now there's a zest being showered upon me

1323
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:22,228
Now I finally know who I was meant to be

1324
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:31,432
Do you remember that moment yesterday
The one with the magic force?

1325
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:37,635
It transformed us into something new
I wonder which moment it was?

1326
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:41,508
The heart says just blindy go to

1327
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:47,916
Any place that desire takes you

1328
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:57,670
Now whatever will be will be

1329
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:04,270
Now whatever will be will be..
- Flying..

1330
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:15,795
Now whatever will be will be..
- Flying..

1331
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:25,875
Now whatever will be will be

1332
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:28,833
What do you mean, you've quit your job?

1333
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:30,751
What do you mean, you've quit your job?

1334
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:31,795
Meaning?

1335
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,995
We're getting married in two months.

1336
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,355
So? You can resume after the wedding.

1337
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,355
How?

1338
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:40,392
First, we'll go on the honeymoon...

1339
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:42,988
then I want to redo the house.

1340
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,230
That will take about a year.

1341
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:48,393
And if you're going to Singapore
for your new project...

1342
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,197
I'll be coming with you.

1343
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:53,915
But...

1344
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:56,070
that hotel is your dream projject, Natasha.

1345
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:57,913
Dreams change baby.

1346
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,952
Then, I didn't know I'd be getting married.

1347
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:02,915
I am Imran.Marriedl??

1348
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:05,997
What does marriage have to do with it?

1349
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:07,998
What do you mean?

1350
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,797
Obviously, priorities change.

1351
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:13,990
After the wedding, even you wouldn't want
to go on this kind of boys holiday

1352
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:28,510
- When is her flight?
- At 6 p.m.

1353
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:33,788
Don't worry man, we'll make it.

1354
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:35,795
Yeah.

1355
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:42,669
Very funny!

1356
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:46,636
All okay, babe?

1357
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:47,791
Yeah.

1358
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:49,749
Can I drive?

1359
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,677
Can you drive?

1360
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:05,716
Babe, the speed limit is 1 20.
You can go faster.

1361
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:07,870
Yes, we may just miss that flight.

1362
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:10,717
I'm not going to drive rashly.

1363
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,154
Watch out!

1364
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:16,270
Please keep your eyes on the road, please!

1365
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:18,751
Then tell him not to talk to me.

1366
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:20,159
Don't talk to her.

1367
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,588
I love this song.

1368
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:33,795
Rock chick in a hard rock world...

1369
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:40,879
I'm a rock chick in a hard rock world...

1370
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:47,919
Nothing rocks better than a rock chick girl...

1371
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:55,038
I'm a rock chick in a hard rock world...

1372
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,394
I had fun.

1373
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:04,789
Listen...

1374
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:09,509
I'm sorry.

1375
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:11,716
Me too.

1376
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:13,709
Bye Bagwati.

1377
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:25,636
Tell me...

1378
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:28,077
what do you think about them?

1379
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:33,989
- Kabir is not himself when Natasha is around.
- That's what I thought.

1380
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:35,630
Correct.

1381
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:38,799
I sense some tension.

1382
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:41,596
Did you speak with him?

1383
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:44,117
Why should l?

1384
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:47,673
If a friend doesn't address a personal problem,
then who will?

1385
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,793
Forget it man!

1386
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,950
They'll sort their problem and
we'll get screwed in the middle.

1387
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:53,950
Chee, man!

1388
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:56,558
You are seriously shameless.

1389
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:57,356
What??

1390
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,628
Look... he is our friend.

1391
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,517
When he is back, let's talk to him.

1392
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:06,590
Okay?

1393
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:08,952
Okay.

1394
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:32,197
God!

1395
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:33,949
Now what has he done?

1396
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:38,152
He's buried inside his diary again.
He's too boring.

1397
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:40,233
What do you write in it?

1398
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,789
It's private.

1399
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:43,710
Rascal...

1400
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:45,679
you've always been secretive.

1401
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:48,917
- But there's nothing to tell.
- No, no, no!

1402
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:51,150
You're obviously struggling with an emotional problem.

1403
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,958
What? Me?

1404
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,274
Arjun...

1405
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,111
I truly believe that...

1406
01:35:57,120 --> 01:36:01,113
if a friend doesn't address a personal problem, then who will?

1407
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:04,356
- Continue.
- Yes, absolutely.

1408
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:06,715
To figure out the problem we have to do a test.

1409
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,756
- I'll say a word.
- Okay.

1410
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:12,833
And you have to say the first thing
that comes to your mind.

1411
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:14,399
Without deliberating.

1412
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,719
- Alright?
- Okay.

1413
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:17,551
- Ready, doctor.
- Fine.

1414
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:18,795
Car.

1415
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:19,956
Road.

1416
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:20,915
Arjun.

1417
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:22,110
Brother.

1418
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,156
Diary.

1419
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:24,076
Poetry.

1420
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:24,910
I am Imran.Heart..

1421
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:25,591
I am Imran.Love..

1422
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:26,550
Mumbai.

1423
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:27,356
Traffic..

1424
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,395
I am Imran..

1425
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:31,155
- Father?
- Mother.

1426
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:36,430
According to my test...

1427
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:39,393
your father is the root of your emotional problem.

1428
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:40,879
And you're keeping this from the world.

1429
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:45,792
And, in my opinion, Dr. Sigmund Fraud...

1430
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:49,679
it's time to shred your degree.
Please stop practicing, please!

1431
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,352
You hurt my feelings, man.

1432
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,709
My bwoys!

1433
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:07,074
If you want a view, look that way.

1434
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:17,831
We should talk to him.

1435
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:27,751
Natasha is really sweet.
It was really nice to meet her.

1436
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:31,548
Yeah... even she was glad to have met you.

1437
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,834
Kabir...

1438
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:40,714
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

1439
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:47,757
Why... are you asking like this?

1440
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,791
I don't know man. Listen...

1441
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,716
it's possible I may be wrong.

1442
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:00,839
But, we are friends.
And I just...

1443
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:01,830
I just have to ask you.

1444
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:06,918
Are you happy with Natasha?

1445
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:12,432
Dude, you just met her.
And the poor girl was a bit tense.

1446
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:15,879
She thought there was something
between Laila and me.

1447
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:18,390
Yeah.

1448
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:22,117
But, now there's no problem.
Thanks to you, my bwoys!

1449
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:24,519
Okay?

1450
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:25,828
She's sweet.

1451
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:27,792
Imran, you've met her.
You spent time with her.

1452
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:28,710
Tell him.

1453
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:30,599
Yes, she is very sweet.

1454
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:35,789
Well that's good, man.

1455
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:36,789
I'm happy for you.

1456
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,913
Hey... here's an extra pillow!

1457
01:38:49,160 --> 01:38:50,354
Good night, bwoys.

1458
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:52,834
Good night.

1459
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:10,990
Guys, do you mind if we take a detour?

1460
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:12,796
Why?

1461
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,157
There is an artist, Salman Habib.

1462
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:18,591
He lives around here.
The lady at the gallery told me.

1463
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:20,670
That he sells his paintings from home.

1464
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:22,235
Really?

1465
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:24,236
Sounds good.

1466
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,709
Anyway, I'm a bit bored hanging
with just the two of you.

1467
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:47,595
The map says we should take
the next right for Grazalema.

1468
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,273
- Salman Habib.

1469
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:51,430
- you'll find Indians in every corner of the world.

1470
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:54,156
- Really, man.
We're everywhere!

1471
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:57,278
Grazalema. Turn right over here.

1472
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:08,836
- Dude, I said right.
- Forget it.

1473
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:12,595
Don't feel like it.
Let's go to Seville.

1474
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,830
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1475
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:16,911
We can go on the way back.
It's okay.

1476
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:19,235
Okay!

1477
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:24,234
It's time to see what I've planned for us.

1478
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:31,756
Check it out, bwoys!

1479
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,355
Look at that guys!

1480
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:39,433
- Arjun, my pal. You rock!
- Look at that dude!

1481
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:40,993
- Wow!
- You b******!

1482
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,273
You're purposely doing this.

1483
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,918
you know i'm scared of heights.

1484
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:46,194
Don't be silly.

1485
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:48,358
I want to do this.
It's my dream.

1486
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:49,998
- Yeah right!
- Just imagine...

1487
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:53,877
jumping from 1 5,000 feet
and flying towards the earth.

1488
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:55,999
That's not flying, that's falling.

1489
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:57,915
It will be fun.

1490
01:40:58,400 --> 01:40:59,355
Relax.

1491
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,511
Remember he eventually enjoyed diving.

1492
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:02,157
- Correct. - Big deal.

1493
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:04,628
with a beautiful instructor like laila, who wouldn't!

1494
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:06,991
You never know, you also might get lucky.

1495
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:10,910
You people ready to jump out of a plane?

1496
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:11,955
- Oh Yeah!

1497
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:14,679
Are you ready to enter the air?

1498
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,869
Yeah!

1499
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:21,794
Head up. Eyes to the horizon.

1500
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:26,190
Arch! Arch!

1501
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,513
- Did I say relax?
- No.

1502
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:35,635
I said arch.
I didn't say relax.

1503
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,119
These are total malfunctions.

1504
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:52,718
In case of a total malfunction
what you have to do is this.

1505
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:54,915
Cut away your main and deploy your resee.

1506
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:56,798
What is that?
You have a malfunction.

1507
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,956
Cut away my main and deploy my reserve.

1508
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:03,359
What are you doing?

1509
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:06,799
- It's a broken line.
- Are you sure it's a broken line?

1510
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:10,917
Scissor kick... scissor kick...

1511
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:12,914
Cut! Deploy!

1512
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:14,750
Perfect!

1513
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:20,357
What's this?

1514
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:21,830
Waiver form.

1515
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:22,511
Waiver form?

1516
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:25,751
If something happens to us... Iike death,
these guys aren't responsible.

1517
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,558
We are responsible for it.

1518
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:28,197
What?

1519
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:32,949
I'll see you outside.

1520
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:10,756
- I'm feeling sick.
- What?

1521
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:13,759
I'm going to throw up.

1522
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:18,597
I'm scared too.

1523
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:20,717
But that's why we are here.

1524
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:24,678
Everybody get ready.

1525
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:25,994
Okay!

1526
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:36,790
Alright, guys.
This is it!

1527
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:58,349
Bye!

1528
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:05,389
Dude!

1529
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:06,715
I'm next.

1530
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:09,914
Adios amigo!

1531
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:12,994
See you downstairs!

1532
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:28,109
Let go, lmran.

1533
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:31,998
Just let it all go!

1534
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:03,148
Push me!

1535
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:00,714
Come on, lmran!

1536
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:04,909
Imran!

1537
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:31,795
Who are you?
Where have you been?

1538
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:34,788
I've moved the heaven and the earth
but I couldn't find you

1539
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:39,516
But you arrive today, so suddenly

1540
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,992
And you give meaning to
my whole life with your love

1541
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:45,433
I don't understand

1542
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:47,711
I don't know

1543
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:50,753
What you've said to me, Senorita

1544
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:54,950
Even then, I have no idea why

1545
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:58,912
I like what I heard, Senorita

1546
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:11,710
Don't look away

1547
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:15,790
Stay close to me

1548
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,868
Take me in your arms

1549
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:23,194
Hope you've understood Senorita

1550
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:27,351
Even a few moments of love

1551
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:31,758
Are never too less

1552
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:34,911
Come let's lose ourselves in them

1553
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:38,950
And forget we ever knew sadness

1554
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:42,794
Senorita, listen to us
Senorita, d'you hear what we're saying

1555
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:46,917
I will never understand

1556
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:50,797
The meaning of the words you dedicate to me

1557
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:54,432
But the warmth of your gaze

1558
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:58,797
Makes me feel like
the most beautiful Senorita

1559
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:03,592
Our eyes looked at each other

1560
01:50:03,600 --> 01:50:06,433
And recounted tales of desire Senorita

1561
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:10,834
That for affection and for love

1562
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:15,511
There is only one language
in the world Senorita

1563
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:18,348
Don't look away from me now

1564
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:21,910
Come closer to me

1565
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:26,518
Take me in your arms

1566
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:30,190
Hope you've understood Senorita

1567
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:33,875
Even a few moments of love

1568
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:37,748
Are never too less

1569
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:41,954
Come let's lose ourselves in them

1570
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:45,548
And forget we ever know sadness

1571
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:49,758
Senorita, listen to us Senorita, d'you hear what we're saying

1572
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,914
With every moment that has passed

1573
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:04,950
Oh Senorita

1574
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:09,638
You've managed to win my heart

1575
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,711
And that's all there is to it

1576
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,636
Don't look away

1577
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:18,715
Stay close to me

1578
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:22,588
Take me in your arms

1579
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:26,558
Hope you've understood Senorita

1580
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:29,912
Even a few moments of love

1581
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:33,836
Are never too less

1582
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:38,310
Come let's lose ourselves in them

1583
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:41,950
And forget we ever knew sadness

1584
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:45,835
Even a few moments of love

1585
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:50,231
Are never too less

1586
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:53,636
Come let's lose ourselves in them

1587
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:57,912
And forget we ever knew sadness

1588
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:24,233
Remember before cable TV
we only had one national channel?

1589
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:28,949
And every Sunday they showed a Hindi film.

1590
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:31,999
Get to the point.

1591
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:34,629
The point is...

1592
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,556
before the film there was this animation.

1593
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:40,949
A white circle went round and round
and formed the channel logo.

1594
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:44,749
Do you remember the tune?

1595
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:05,750
Brilliant!

1596
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:19,836
That tune never failed to depress me.

1597
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:21,909
Depressed.

1598
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:25,432
I'm feeling the same right now.

1599
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:30,756
Weekend's over and school begins.

1600
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:33,952
- And you wanted to cancel this trip!
- I know, man!

1601
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:35,234
Can you imagine?

1602
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:40,395
You know what that means?

1603
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:43,028
It means...

1604
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:46,510
that everything is predestined.

1605
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:50,149
Everything!

1606
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:54,875
This holiday was in our destiny.

1607
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:56,835
You know!

1608
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:01,592
You, me and asshole.

1609
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:04,551
- Cheers asshole.
- Where's asshole?

1610
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:07,118
Cheers!

1611
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,592
Laila too.

1612
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:17,836
I was meant to meet her.

1613
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,433
You are in louw, my bwoy.

1614
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:22,349
No, man!

1615
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:24,193
You are in louw...

1616
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:26,199
- you Are in louw...

1617
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:29,033
- you are in louw... - kabir, man!

1618
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:31,588
Everything is written. Listen to me.

1619
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:33,193
It's all predestined.

1620
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:34,270
You know what I'm saying?

1621
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:36,510
This moment... us right now...

1622
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:37,839
it's predestined.

1623
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:39,558
I am Imran.predestined..

1624
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:42,276
Please stop saying, 'predestined...'!

1625
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:44,079
I beg of you!

1626
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:47,109
This too is predestined.
It's all written.

1627
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:49,111
Alright, we get it.

1628
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:50,997
Listen, we get it, zip!

1629
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:52,274
Come on, man!

1630
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:54,875
It's true.

1631
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,194
It's predestined...

1632
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:58,076
Guys...

1633
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:24,672
Guys, watch out!

1634
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:28,515
What the hell, guys?

1635
01:55:35,320 --> 01:55:36,070
Yes?

1636
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:54,633
- Our man is back.
- Their mobiles are switched off.

1637
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:55,595
- What? - Yup.

1638
01:55:55,720 --> 01:55:56,835
Even Nuria's?

1639
01:55:56,840 --> 01:55:58,239
Yes, I'm shocked.

1640
01:55:58,360 --> 01:56:01,432
When she knew we'd land up in jail,
she should've kept the phone switched on

1641
01:56:02,920 --> 01:56:04,911
If our bail isn't posted...

1642
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:07,309
we'll be stuck here for days.

1643
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:12,710
Arjun...

1644
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:16,278
tell them I want to make a call.

1645
01:56:17,320 --> 01:56:18,514
To whom?

1646
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:20,874
Salman Habib.

1647
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:22,275
The artist?

1648
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:24,711
Yeah.

1649
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:27,918
Why will he come to post our bail?

1650
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:30,830
Are you alright?

1651
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:34,188
Just because we can't reach anyone,
he's losing it.

1652
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:35,269
He's my father.

1653
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:36,757
What?

1654
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:40,514
I am his son.

1655
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:51,909
Just let it go lmran.

1656
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:55,829
Just let it go.

1657
01:56:56,280 --> 01:56:56,871
- Hello...

1658
01:56:58,360 --> 01:56:59,839
Hello, may l...

1659
01:56:59,840 --> 01:57:01,751
speak with Mr.Salman Habib, please?

1660
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:03,357
- Yes?

1661
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:06,831
Sir, I am lmran.

1662
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:11,115
I am Rahila's son.

1663
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:16,839
When did you find out?

1664
01:57:20,200 --> 01:57:22,077
A few days after Abu died.

1665
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:28,389
In his stuff,
I found a letter that Ammi had written to him.

1666
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:31,631
The letter stated that...

1667
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:37,357
Ammi was grateful that
Abu had accepted her and her unborn child.

1668
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:42,233
Why didn't you tell us?

1669
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:46,713
I was a bit shaken up.

1670
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:50,794
What would I tell you?
Abu is not my father.

1671
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:55,556
He loved you a lot.

1672
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:58,757
He really loved you.

1673
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:01,829
And us.

1674
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:04,756
I mean, think about it.

1675
01:58:04,760 --> 01:58:07,149
Be it sports day or parent-teacher meetings...

1676
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:10,596
our fathers seldom came,
but Abu was always there.

1677
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:14,350
Well, my father was dead.

1678
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:18,150
So, if he showed up for sports day
it would've been a bit strange.

1679
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:26,593
- You've got bail.

1680
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:31,035
They're here.

1681
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:43,789
Hi.

1682
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:47,590
Imran.

1683
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:50,795
Imran...

1684
01:58:51,880 --> 01:58:52,790
I'm Salman.

1685
01:58:57,560 --> 01:58:59,630
My friends, Arjun and Kabir.

1686
01:58:59,640 --> 01:59:00,709
- Hello.
- Thank you.

1687
01:59:00,720 --> 01:59:02,073
Hi... thank you.

1688
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,991
You three look pretty hungover.

1689
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:11,113
You're welcome to come over
to my place and freshen up.

1690
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:14,638
Our bags and car are at the hotel.

1691
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:16,148
I'll drive you there.

1692
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:18,836
Come.

1693
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:35,836
- Wow, this is beautiful.

1694
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:38,555
It's really nice.

1695
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:41,791
Are you always so polite?

1696
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:46,756
It's absolute rubbish.
Anyone can do that.

1697
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:49,915
This gentleman, my neighbour...

1698
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:53,151
was obsessed with having
his wife immortalised in a portrait.

1699
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:56,835
So I applies my brush and fulfilled his desire.

1700
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:59,070
And with his money, paid my bills.

1701
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:03,710
So, what are you guys doing in Seville?

1702
02:00:04,600 --> 02:00:05,794
Skydiving.

1703
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:06,994
Really? - Yeah.

1704
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:09,230
So, you jumped out of a plane and landed in jail?

1705
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:11,794
You could say that.

1706
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:16,558
That apart, what do you do?

1707
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:19,039
Well, I'm a financial broker.

1708
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:20,515
In London.

1709
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:21,915
Money man.

1710
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:24,157
And you?

1711
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:26,597
My family is in the construction business.

1712
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:29,835
Well, never mind.
Everyone makes mistakes.

1713
02:00:30,800 --> 02:00:31,789
That's funny.

1714
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:34,311
You're a Xerox copy of him.

1715
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:39,837
And, what about you?

1716
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:41,956
I write.

1717
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:44,232
What?

1718
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:46,752
I'm a copywriter in advertising.

1719
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:50,912
Writing copy for ads is like
a buffet for the masses.

1720
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:53,994
For instance, this painting is for someone else.

1721
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:58,319
Do you write anything to feed your own soul?

1722
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:01,359
I do.

1723
02:01:06,120 --> 02:01:06,757
Sir?

1724
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:07,756
Salman.

1725
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:10,278
Right. We'll be outside.

1726
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:30,878
Your hands are very similar to mine.

1727
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:35,315
Sit.

1728
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:39,876
Do you live alone?

1729
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:41,430
No.

1730
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:42,910
I have a wife.

1731
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:45,555
But she is away... in Paris.

1732
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:46,796
Sit.

1733
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:50,875
And any...

1734
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:52,074
children?iil?

1735
02:01:58,840 --> 02:01:59,829
Do you ever come to lndia?

1736
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:01,989
Yes.

1737
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,833
I was there four years ago when my mother passed away.

1738
02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:07,918
- Sorry.
- I have a brother there...

1739
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:08,875
I am Imran.but....

1740
02:02:10,640 --> 02:02:11,755
we don't meet.

1741
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:19,715
I've often thought about you.

1742
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:22,716
I mean...

1743
02:02:24,280 --> 02:02:28,876
that someday, somewhere we might meet.

1744
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:32,795
But I never figured...

1745
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:35,439
what I would say to you.

1746
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:38,274
Just say the truth.

1747
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,230
The truth... what is the truth?

1748
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:46,994
Everyone has their own version.

1749
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:54,630
Look... I was...

1750
02:02:54,640 --> 02:02:56,437
25 then.

1751
02:02:57,680 --> 02:03:00,638
Rahila was a few years younger.

1752
02:03:01,880 --> 02:03:04,838
When you're young the future doesn't matter.

1753
02:03:04,840 --> 02:03:06,319
We were just kids.

1754
02:03:08,920 --> 02:03:10,956
One day...

1755
02:03:11,080 --> 02:03:13,674
Rahila told me that she's...

1756
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:17,033
expecting a baby.

1757
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:19,998
I wasn't ready for the responsibility then.

1758
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:21,957
And nor am I now.

1759
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:31,512
So... you just abandoned her?

1760
02:03:35,320 --> 02:03:38,312
I guess, you could say that.

1761
02:03:43,600 --> 02:03:47,991
Rahila wanted a family,
she wanted to be a mother.

1762
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:51,920
I had other dreams.
I wanted to be an artist.

1763
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:54,911
I wanted to paint...

1764
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:56,512
travel the world.

1765
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:00,388
I loved her but...

1766
02:04:00,400 --> 02:04:03,437
she made her choice and I made mine.

1767
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:05,278
That's all.

1768
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:11,435
I found out about you only last year.

1769
02:04:15,400 --> 02:04:16,355
But...

1770
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,798
you've always known about me.

1771
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:25,160
Did you never want to see me?

1772
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:29,197
I thought it was better this way.

1773
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:39,799
You asked for the truth.

1774
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:42,189
Well, this is it.

1775
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:44,549
Okay.

1776
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:46,319
I... am sorry, lmran.

1777
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:49,269
No, you're not.

1778
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:56,714
Is there something I can do for you?

1779
02:04:58,160 --> 02:05:01,152
Apologise only when it comes from here.

1780
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:27,432
When clouds of pain loom in the sky

1781
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:31,038
When a shadow of sadness flickers by

1782
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:34,758
When a tear finds it's way to the eye

1783
02:05:35,200 --> 02:05:38,158
When fear keeps the loneliness alive

1784
02:05:39,160 --> 02:05:43,711
I try and console my heart
Why is it that you cry? I ask

1785
02:05:43,720 --> 02:05:46,359
This is only what life imparts

1786
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:49,554
These deep silences within

1787
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:52,718
Have been handed out to all by time

1788
02:05:53,800 --> 02:05:56,360
Everyone's story has a little sorrow

1789
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:59,713
Everyone's share has a little Sunshine

1790
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:02,990
No need for water in your eyes

1791
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:06,875
Every moment can be a new life

1792
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:10,350
Why do you let them pass you by

1793
02:06:11,720 --> 02:06:13,915
Oh heart, why is it that you cry?

1794
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:24,154
Morning...

1795
02:06:30,520 --> 02:06:31,509
Did you sleep or not?

1796
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:33,751
No.

1797
02:06:42,960 --> 02:06:45,758
I think, we should get going.

1798
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:48,349
Let's go.

1799
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:50,432
Arjun...

1800
02:06:54,680 --> 02:06:56,432
I'm really sorry.

1801
02:07:21,320 --> 02:07:22,389
I'll see you at the car.

1802
02:07:22,720 --> 02:07:23,516
Yeah.

1803
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:29,557
What do you mean,
'you slept in the car'?

1804
02:07:30,240 --> 02:07:31,639
Long story, babe.

1805
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:33,749
Tell me, what happened?

1806
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:36,836
Well, lmran just...

1807
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:39,954
I'll tell you later, okay.

1808
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:42,711
Why? Tell me now, what happened?

1809
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:45,838
I can't tell you right now.
I'll tell you when I'm back.

1810
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:47,872
Why are you getting irritated?

1811
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:49,791
Why are you going on about it?

1812
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:51,433
Okay, forget it.

1813
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:56,909
See.

1814
02:07:57,120 --> 02:07:58,917
It's our wedding card.
Can you see it?

1815
02:07:59,160 --> 02:08:00,673
Isn't it gorgeous?

1816
02:08:01,080 --> 02:08:02,877
I'm just so happy with it.

1817
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:06,194
Oh... I've emailed a few options for your suit.

1818
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:08,794
please select one.
Okay? Don't forget.

1819
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:10,276
Okay.

1820
02:08:12,600 --> 02:08:14,830
You are so far away.

1821
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:17,552
You love me, right?

1822
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:19,715
Yeah.

1823
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:22,397
Then stop fighting with me.

1824
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:26,351
Everything was fine
before you went on this holiday.

1825
02:08:26,960 --> 02:08:28,712
Kabir, just come home.

1826
02:08:29,320 --> 02:08:32,869
To me, your family, your friends.

1827
02:08:33,120 --> 02:08:34,872
My friends are with me.

1828
02:08:35,240 --> 02:08:37,196
Yeah, I know.
But you know what I mean.

1829
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:55,831
Happy birthday to you...

1830
02:08:56,800 --> 02:09:00,315
Happy birthday dear Anjali...

1831
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:03,593
Happy birthday to you...

1832
02:09:08,760 --> 02:09:10,113
What a beautiful cake.

1833
02:09:10,120 --> 02:09:10,996
Oh my God!

1834
02:09:12,080 --> 02:09:13,274
It's beautiful!

1835
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:14,835
- Nice, right?
- Yes!

1836
02:09:16,760 --> 02:09:17,829
Tanya?

1837
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:28,954
What are you doing, baby?

1838
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:30,948
I'm sorry, I'm so happy.

1839
02:09:31,560 --> 02:09:33,835
Kabir just proposed to Natasha.

1840
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:34,955
- What
- What?

1841
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:36,951
Oh my god!

1842
02:09:36,960 --> 02:09:39,793
you could've waited until your mother had cut the cake.

1843
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:42,792
Kabir, this is the best birthday gift, ever!

1844
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:43,756
I love you, son.

1845
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:44,829
- The shy guy!

1846
02:09:45,720 --> 02:09:47,836
- It's a double celebration.

1847
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:49,159
I'm so happy.

1848
02:09:49,880 --> 02:09:50,835
Now you have to call me 'mummy'.

1849
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:54,317
- Get some champagne!

1850
02:09:56,960 --> 02:09:57,597
Come here.

1851
02:09:59,960 --> 02:10:01,439
Very good decision.

1852
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:05,716
I'm so happy.

1853
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:09,439
Babe, what just happened in there?

1854
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:11,915
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

1855
02:10:12,280 --> 02:10:13,952
This ring...

1856
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:15,439
I got it for my mom.

1857
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:19,192
It's her birthday gift.

1858
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:20,795
This is for your mom?

1859
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:24,438
Look at it sweety...
it's a mummy ring.

1860
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:25,788
What?

1861
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:27,233
why didn't you say something?

1862
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:29,239
I tried.

1863
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:33,199
But you were excited and screaming.
And Tanya made an announcement.

1864
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:35,995
So you don't want to marry me?

1865
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:39,950
It's not about you.
I haven't even thought about marriage.

1866
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:44,552
What do I tell my father?

1867
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:52,398
We'll say that we gave
it some more thought and...

1868
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:54,755
we need more time.
That's all.

1869
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:56,512
This is so embarrassing.

1870
02:10:57,320 --> 02:10:59,356
I'm so sorry, sweety.

1871
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:02,959
You don't ever want to marry me?

1872
02:11:04,280 --> 02:11:06,077
It's not like that.

1873
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:08,753
If it is, you better tell me right now!

1874
02:11:09,880 --> 02:11:12,758
I really love you, Kabir.
And I don't...

1875
02:11:12,760 --> 02:11:15,797
No, no... no sweety.
Don't cry.

1876
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:16,790
Not now.

1877
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:24,917
Kabir...

1878
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:30,714
are you even serious
about this relationship or not?

1879
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:34,716
You know what...

1880
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:46,795
Will you marry me?

1881
02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:12,029
Who is it?

1882
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:27,710
Room service.

1883
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:29,756
Laila?

1884
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:31,710
Hi!

1885
02:12:31,720 --> 02:12:32,709
Oh my god!

1886
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:35,592
You're here... how... I mean...

1887
02:12:35,880 --> 02:12:38,758
Imran called and he begged me to come.

1888
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:40,148
- So I came.
- lmran?

1889
02:12:40,760 --> 02:12:41,795
I knew it.

1890
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:43,839
He is my best friend.

1891
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,195
I am... so glad you're here.

1892
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:52,318
I'm glad you are glad.

1893
02:12:54,920 --> 02:12:57,115
Hello... my the two the love the birds!

1894
02:12:57,720 --> 02:12:58,869
Hello!

1895
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:00,109
Surprised, Arjun?

1896
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:02,589
Thank you.

1897
02:13:02,680 --> 02:13:03,908
It's good to see you.

1898
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:05,148
- And you.
- Hey gorgeous.

1899
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:07,350
- I love you too.
- Nice to have you back.

1900
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:08,839
You got a tan!

1901
02:13:09,560 --> 02:13:10,549
Get dressed, soon!

1902
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:11,709
- We had to leave at seven. - Correct.

1903
02:13:11,720 --> 02:13:12,948
- Two minutes? - You Missed me?

1904
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:14,791
I always miss you, darling.

1905
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:15,835
Where are we going?

1906
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:17,433
It's a surprise.
Can't tell you in front of him.

1907
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:36,714
What's going on?

1908
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:38,029
What do you mean?

1909
02:13:38,360 --> 02:13:39,395
It's San Fermin.

1910
02:13:39,560 --> 02:13:40,595
Running with the bulls.

1911
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:41,828
- Really?
- Didn't you know?

1912
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:43,035
Just follow me...

1913
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:52,515
Holy shit!

1914
02:13:59,560 --> 02:14:01,073
Are these guys mad?
What are they doing?

1915
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:02,110
Suicide.

1916
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:03,994
Isn't that why you are here?

1917
02:14:14,920 --> 02:14:16,717
I felt this should be
the last experience of our trip.

1918
02:14:17,640 --> 02:14:19,949
This could be the last experience of our life!

1919
02:14:20,360 --> 02:14:22,590
Stop it, Arjun.
Let's grab a bite.

1920
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:23,032
Come on..

1921
02:14:24,120 --> 02:14:25,189
- Excuse me.
- Dude are you...

1922
02:14:25,200 --> 02:14:26,519
- i'm starving!

1923
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,638
This is not an adventure sport.

1924
02:14:30,200 --> 02:14:31,599
I object, Judge sahab!

1925
02:14:32,120 --> 02:14:34,315
I agree it's not as safe as regular sports.

1926
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:35,799
And is illegal in some countries.

1927
02:14:35,800 --> 02:14:38,792
But according to the
Spanish tradition and culture...

1928
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:39,790
it is allowed.

1929
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:41,791
And technically, according to our deal...

1930
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:44,110
we can choose any sport, remember?

1931
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:45,959
Imran, it's really dangerous, you know.

1932
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:48,155
Yes, those bulls could kill us, alright?

1933
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:51,080
We'll be dangling on their horns
like tandoori chicken on skewers!

1934
02:14:51,080 --> 02:14:52,798
Precisely the point.

1935
02:14:53,920 --> 02:14:55,990
You want to get rid of the fear within you?

1936
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:58,550
Well then, here's our deepest fear.
Death.

1937
02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:00,635
Let's face it.

1938
02:15:01,120 --> 02:15:02,599
Because beyond this fear...

1939
02:15:02,600 --> 02:15:03,430
Iies victory!

1940
02:15:03,560 --> 02:15:05,596
Please spare us the tag lines!

1941
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:07,791
Dude, think about it!

1942
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:11,588
No training, no instructors. Just us, my amigos!

1943
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:13,992
And some bulls running after us.

1944
02:15:14,280 --> 02:15:16,669
If you want to live... just run!

1945
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:19,115
Laila, do you know
any psychiatrist around here?

1946
02:15:19,880 --> 02:15:22,110
Because our amigo has completely lost it!

1947
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:24,951
I'll be at the starting line
at seven tomorrow morning.

1948
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:27,756
With or without you.

1949
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:33,672
I have something for you, lmran.

1950
02:15:33,680 --> 02:15:34,669
I have something for you, Imran.

1951
02:15:35,520 --> 02:15:36,270
It's from Nuria.

1952
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:37,588
Oh..

1953
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:40,750
It's in Spanish.

1954
02:15:41,720 --> 02:15:43,039
Love has no language.

1955
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:44,391
So true.

1956
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:48,873
I think you should buy her something.

1957
02:15:49,680 --> 02:15:50,430
You're absolutely right.

1958
02:15:50,920 --> 02:15:52,638
Guys... next stop - shopping.

1959
02:15:53,960 --> 02:15:55,632
Count me out, I'm going back to the hotel.

1960
02:15:56,760 --> 02:15:57,875
Are you alright?

1961
02:15:58,760 --> 02:15:59,829
Hey.

1962
02:16:00,120 --> 02:16:00,916
I'm fine.

1963
02:16:01,760 --> 02:16:03,716
That we'll only know after a test.

1964
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:05,550
Test?

1965
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:07,875
What do you say, Dr. Fraud?

1966
02:16:08,760 --> 02:16:09,636
Are you game?

1967
02:16:10,120 --> 02:16:10,791
Bring it on.

1968
02:16:11,640 --> 02:16:12,709
You have to say the first thing --

1969
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:14,915
I know the drill. Ask!

1970
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:16,437
Black.

1971
02:16:16,760 --> 02:16:17,192
Night.

1972
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:18,110
Sea.

1973
02:16:18,320 --> 02:16:18,991
Salty.

1974
02:16:19,080 --> 02:16:19,876
Work.

1975
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:20,869
Money.

1976
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:21,710
Sex.

1977
02:16:21,960 --> 02:16:22,756
I like!

1978
02:16:22,760 --> 02:16:23,397
I am Imran.Friiend..

1979
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:24,551
You.

1980
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:25,789
Marriage.

1981
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:28,109
Family.

1982
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:35,756
What?

1983
02:16:37,760 --> 02:16:39,113
Is that all?

1984
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:40,519
it was enough.

1985
02:16:42,320 --> 02:16:43,912
Smartass...

1986
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:47,799
You're using my trick on me? Just say what you want to.

1987
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:49,076
Okay.

1988
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:52,228
You hesitated on 'marriage'.

1989
02:16:52,800 --> 02:16:54,028
So?

1990
02:16:54,120 --> 02:16:57,715
I'm just saying... you hesitated...
on marriage.

1991
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:02,550
Look...

1992
02:17:03,560 --> 02:17:06,916
I don't have the time for this crap.
See you later.

1993
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:13,434
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, I'm going to...

1994
02:17:21,320 --> 02:17:22,275
Kabir.

1995
02:17:27,440 --> 02:17:28,190
Go!

1996
02:17:31,080 --> 02:17:32,229
Kabir!

1997
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:34,872
Kabir... man, just stop!

1998
02:17:35,520 --> 02:17:36,635
What?

1999
02:17:37,800 --> 02:17:39,631
Talk to us man. What's going on?

2000
02:17:39,880 --> 02:17:41,711
It's nothing, really.

2001
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:44,875
Kabir...

2002
02:17:46,840 --> 02:17:48,956
Look, I'm sorry I lost my cool.

2003
02:17:50,320 --> 02:17:52,754
Because I said you have
a problem with marriage?

2004
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:56,910
I guess, I'm freaking out.
I don't know what's happening.

2005
02:17:57,160 --> 02:17:59,594
It's normal to be nervous.

2006
02:17:59,600 --> 02:18:01,955
It's not like
you're having an arranged marriage.

2007
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:04,793
Yeah, but she isn't the same person I met.

2008
02:18:05,400 --> 02:18:07,595
She's changed, she's become possessive.

2009
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:11,510
The girl I knew was a talented,
independent interior designer.

2010
02:18:11,720 --> 02:18:13,756
She enjoyed her work.

2011
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:14,715
I am Imran.But now....

2012
02:18:15,160 --> 02:18:17,116
she's bid adieu to her passion and...

2013
02:18:17,400 --> 02:18:19,277
taken over my life.

2014
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:22,191
Of course, I want a partner but...

2015
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:23,838
I want my own life too!

2016
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:27,954
The whole two bodies, one soul thing
I won't be able to handle it.

2017
02:18:38,840 --> 02:18:40,796
- May I ask you something?
- Yes.

2018
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:44,235
Don't you think you proposed to her too soon?

2019
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:47,115
Actually, I didn't even propose.

2020
02:18:47,120 --> 02:18:48,838
- What?

2021
02:18:48,840 --> 02:18:50,990
I'd bought a ring
for my mom as a birthday gift.

2022
02:18:51,320 --> 02:18:54,835
Before giving it, I happened to show it
to Natasha and she thought...

2023
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:56,712
it was meant for her.

2024
02:18:58,400 --> 02:19:00,038
- Are you crazy?
- What are you doing?

2025
02:19:00,640 --> 02:19:02,358
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong with him?

2026
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:09,955
No wonder this vacation was
so important for you.

2027
02:19:10,880 --> 02:19:11,437
Meaning?

2028
02:19:12,640 --> 02:19:15,916
Basically, you wanted to hear from someone else
that you shouldn't get married

2029
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:18,798
And besides us,
who would've told you this.

2030
02:19:18,800 --> 02:19:20,631
Have you totally lost it?

2031
02:19:20,640 --> 02:19:23,200
The invites are printed.
This isn't the time to overreact!

2032
02:19:24,160 --> 02:19:25,115
Kabir.

2033
02:19:26,800 --> 02:19:28,358
We know Natasha is a great girl.

2034
02:19:28,720 --> 02:19:30,676
And we know you like her.

2035
02:19:31,080 --> 02:19:32,718
And of course, you don't want to hurt her.

2036
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:36,718
But ask yourself --
Do you really want to marry her?

2037
02:19:37,360 --> 02:19:38,952
And if not, be honest.

2038
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:40,678
To yourself and to her.

2039
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:44,158
Of course, she'll be hurt.
But in the long run its best for both of you.

2040
02:19:44,360 --> 02:19:45,918
He is absolutely right, Kabir.

2041
02:19:46,280 --> 02:19:47,998
But I've made a commitment.

2042
02:19:48,520 --> 02:19:50,158
Okay, you screwed up.

2043
02:19:50,160 --> 02:19:52,151
No one's going to send you to prison.

2044
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:54,748
It's not that simple.
Our parents are involved.

2045
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:55,796
Parents?

2046
02:19:56,320 --> 02:19:57,514
Dude, it's your life.

2047
02:20:00,600 --> 02:20:01,749
You won't get it.

2048
02:20:02,960 --> 02:20:03,756
Just...

2049
02:20:04,600 --> 02:20:06,795
Just let it be, okay?
I'm sorry.

2050
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:08,749
Kabir...

2051
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:13,395
What a guy!

2052
02:20:31,760 --> 02:20:32,795
Laila?

2053
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:37,755
Why're you shouting?

2054
02:20:38,840 --> 02:20:40,353
Why are you so far?

2055
02:20:54,760 --> 02:20:55,636
Better?

2056
02:20:56,800 --> 02:20:57,835
Best.

2057
02:21:00,920 --> 02:21:01,591
Ammi?

2058
02:21:02,760 --> 02:21:04,079
How are you?

2059
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:08,916
I met Salman.

2060
02:21:15,360 --> 02:21:18,397
I now know why you and
Abu kept this from me.

2061
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:22,989
I'm sorry, Ammi.

2062
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:26,995
- I love you.

2063
02:21:28,760 --> 02:21:30,352
I love you too, my boy.

2064
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:53,872
The first rocket indicates that
the pen gates have been opened.

2065
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:56,714
Second rocket indicates that
the bulls are coming towards us.

2066
02:23:56,880 --> 02:23:58,757
We run at the second rocket.

2067
02:23:58,760 --> 02:23:59,590
Second rocket.

2068
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:02,838
Oh San Fermin, please protect us.

2069
02:24:04,760 --> 02:24:05,909
If I die...

2070
02:24:06,360 --> 02:24:08,032
my spirit will come back to haunt you.

2071
02:24:08,600 --> 02:24:09,999
Why are you thinking about death?

2072
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:12,036
Think about what you'll do
if you survive.

2073
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:17,118
Listen...

2074
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:18,875
a new pact.

2075
02:24:19,720 --> 02:24:21,312
An if-l-get out-alive pact.

2076
02:24:21,400 --> 02:24:22,435
Yeah.

2077
02:24:22,560 --> 02:24:24,994
If I get out alive,
I'll let you read my poetry.

2078
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:27,838
Why just you?
I'll just...

2079
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:28,829
get it published.

2080
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:30,909
You write poetry?

2081
02:24:30,920 --> 02:24:31,716
Yes..

2082
02:24:33,720 --> 02:24:34,675
Okay.

2083
02:24:34,800 --> 02:24:36,836
If I get out alive...

2084
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:40,557
Okay!

2085
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:42,916
If I get out alive...

2086
02:24:42,920 --> 02:24:44,717
I'll go to morocco with Laila.

2087
02:24:44,720 --> 02:24:45,755
Yeah!!.

2088
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:46,949
That's what I'll do.

2089
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:49,715
What's the worst that could happen?
I'll get fired.

2090
02:24:49,720 --> 02:24:50,709
- Right? - Yeah.

2091
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:51,709
Who cares man??

2092
02:24:51,720 --> 02:24:52,948
I am Imran.I'lil be with her and I wiilil liive..

2093
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:54,628
Well done, my bro!

2094
02:24:55,640 --> 02:24:56,390
Come on, Kabir.

2095
02:24:58,920 --> 02:24:59,511
Okay.

2096
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:01,112
If I get out alive...

2097
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:06,759
Shit guys!
The gates are open!

2098
02:25:07,160 --> 02:25:08,229
Kabir just say it.

2099
02:25:08,320 --> 02:25:09,958
It's okay, just say it.

2100
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:20,113
If I get out alive, I'll go to London...

2101
02:25:20,120 --> 02:25:21,758
and telil Natasha that....

2102
02:25:31,800 --> 02:25:33,028
Say what? Just say it!

2103
02:25:33,360 --> 02:25:34,679
Come on, Kabir!

2104
02:25:38,640 --> 02:25:40,517
- Come on, Kabir!
- Come on!

2105
02:25:40,600 --> 02:25:43,068
I'm sorry but I can't marry you.

2106
02:25:45,320 --> 02:25:45,911
- Congratulations!
- Look out!

2107
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:47,194
- Congratulations!
- Look out!

2108
02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:32,559
If you're carrying your restlessness
in your heart

2109
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:34,630
You are alive

2110
02:28:34,720 --> 02:28:37,154
If you're carrying the lighting of dreams
in your eyes

2111
02:28:37,240 --> 02:28:38,514
You are alive

2112
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:42,878
Like a gust of wind, learn to live free

2113
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:46,432
Learn to flow like the waves that make a sea

2114
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:50,151
Let your arms be wide open,
to every moment you meet

2115
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:54,395
May every moment gift you a new sight to greet

2116
02:28:54,920 --> 02:28:57,388
If you're carrying your wonder in your eyes

2117
02:28:57,520 --> 02:28:59,317
You are alive

2118
02:28:59,960 --> 02:29:02,952
If you're carrying your restlessness
in your heart

2119
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:05,513
You are alive

2120
02:32:55,160 --> 02:32:57,513
<u>THE END</u>
