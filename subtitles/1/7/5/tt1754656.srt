1
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,538
Once, when I was six years old,
I read a book about the primeval forest.

2
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,709
The book said,

3
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:28,463
"Boa constrictors swallow
their prey whole, without chewing it."

4
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:37,680
I pondered this deeply.
And then, I did my first drawing.

5
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,225
I showed my masterpiece to grown-ups

6
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,770
and asked if the drawing
frightened them.

7
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:44,937
Frightened?

8
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,815
Why should anyone
be frightened of a hat?

9
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,484
Grown-ups.

10
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,986
They never understand
anything by themselves.

11
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:55,490
So, I did another drawing.

12
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,285
Well. My advice is stick to arithmetic.

13
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,662
- History.
- And grammar.

14
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:06,000
I took their advice and I grew up.

15
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,213
I forgot all about being a child.

16
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:14,383
Until something miraculous happened.

17
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,567
The Little Prince

18
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:42,328
I have always wanted to find someone
to share my story with, but...

19
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,330
I don't know...

20
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,750
I guess this world just got too grown-up.

21
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:55,758
Tonight, let's recap today's recap
of today's market activity.

22
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,636
Record-breaking numbers
were written down on pieces of paper,

23
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,889
taken to the bank,
placed in drawers and locked with keys.

24
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,768
Backs straight.

25
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,895
Listening attentively.

26
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,438
Listening.

27
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,441
No excessive blinking.

28
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,694
Listening.

29
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,154
Unexpected praise.

30
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:20,408
Acknowledge and thank you.

31
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,078
A real smile, sweetie. Show your teeth.

32
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,455
Not too much.

33
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,416
Good. Okay.

34
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,293
Now remember,

35
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:33,754
statistics tell us that if the panel
is leaning toward acceptance,

36
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,882
they will ask only one question.

37
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,008
The big question.

38
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,511
Are you Werth Academy material?

39
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,472
One, two, three.

40
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,601
Three things make me Werth...

41
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,443
Zero-one-seven?

42
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,362
Go on.

43
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,637
We've reviewed your application.

44
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,513
Thank you!

45
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,516
We've reviewed your file...

46
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,769
Thank... You.

47
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,025
We've read your essay,

48
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,028
"The transformative power of zero
on the bottom line"

49
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,614
and the follow-up, "Zero, still my hero."

50
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,204
Everything looks to be perfect.

51
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,459
We will ask you just one question today.

52
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,961
The big question!

53
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,171
"Are you Werth Academy material?"

54
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:02,134
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

55
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,222
One, two, three.

56
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,225
Three things make me
Werth Academy material.

57
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,393
No. No.

58
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,728
One, like Werth, I am intelligent.

59
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,730
Two, like Werth, I am serious.

60
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,816
- Stop.
- Three...

61
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,484
Like Werth...

62
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,529
My unwavering...

63
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,489
Abort... Abort.

64
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,158
...will to

65
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,411
learn...

66
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,249
Thank you.

67
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,085
Sweetie!

68
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,757
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE
WHEN YOU GROW UP?

69
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,217
ESSENTIAL.

70
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,892
Apparently,
they changed the big question.

71
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,896
I'm sorry, Mum.

72
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,898
Don't be.

73
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,026
We'll just have to go to Plan B.

74
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,193
"B"?

75
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,195
You said Plan B was impossible!

76
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,520
That's why we went with Plan A.

77
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,116
Plan B is the new Plan A.

78
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,286
We're moving forward!

79
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,539
Neighbourhood identified. Check.

80
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,043
If by some miracle we find
an affordable house here,

81
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,252
they will have to take you.

82
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,088
REDUCED PRICE
HOUSE FOR SALE

83
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,966
Check. Check.

84
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,387
Moving truck, check.

85
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,222
FIRST DAY OF SUMMER HOLIDAYS

86
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,933
Matters of consequence today for
the serious and sensible man...

87
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,393
We did it!

88
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,396
You're going to Werth Academy
whether they like it or not.

89
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,776
Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive,
it comes to the same thing for us.

90
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,573
No one is ever satisfied
where he is, pursuing nothing...

91
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,579
Our new home. Check.

92
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,351
Is it too late for a Plan C?

93
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:21,357
Just keep reminding yourself that
that house made this house available,

94
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,859
and made your future possible.

95
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,504
Mum?

96
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,055
Do you really think
I'm Werth Academy material?

97
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,559
You will be by the end of the summer.
I have a plan.

98
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,228
Right on time.

99
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,899
I present to you your life plan.

100
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,401
My life plan?

101
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,322
Your life plan.

102
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,075
We're not leaving anything to chance.

103
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,203
Everything's here.
From top to bottom. Left to right.

104
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,830
Let's take a look.

105
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,749
The minute of the hour,
hour of the day, day of the week,

106
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:24,086
week of the month, month of the year,
the year of your life.

107
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,172
Everything! Got it?

108
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,595
It's even got a chart
for all your birthday gifts.

109
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,264
Like your ninth birthday,
coming up. Microscope.

110
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,892
Perfect for
the Werth Academy biology curriculum.

111
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,602
It's already wrapped.

112
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,770
- Wow.
- Yes.

113
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,107
But for now, this is your priority.

114
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,568
The first day of your new school.

115
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,947
We've got 53 days to go,
which doesn't sound like much,

116
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:55,117
until you break it into hours, 1,272.

117
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,786
Or minutes, 76,320.

118
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,207
Only then do you realise
how much can be accomplished.

119
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,960
You will use every minute,
hour and day according to this.

120
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,046
Because, let's face it,

121
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,548
you're going to be all alone out there.

122
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,134
All alone.

123
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,804
So...

124
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:18,307
We can't afford any more mistakes,
like the interview.

125
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,433
Right.

126
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,812
You're going to make
a wonderful grown-up.

127
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,314
Thank you, Mum.

128
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,903
I wish I could stay, sweetie,
but it's the Davis audit, again.

129
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,572
Kelly's numbers on
the Miller account are problematic.

130
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:36,492
Fines found out
and now Logan's in a panic.

131
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:37,993
Fisher wants nothing to do with it...

132
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,161
Logan.

133
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,580
- So I've got to go...
- And put it right.

134
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:44,333
Yes, but I'm not even sure
that's possible.

135
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,336
If anyone can do it, it's you. Go on.

136
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,129
I've got my life plan!

137
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,257
You're my senior VP.

138
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,811
Let's do it.

139
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,680
Gas.

140
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,269
Anybody home?

141
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,026
Bolts...

142
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,297
I didn't actually believe
he had a plane back there.

143
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,217
I think the old guy flew away years ago.

144
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,053
I'm just thankful
we don't live next door to him.

145
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:03,889
Roger that.

146
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,608
What a surprise!

147
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,320
A very good afternoon to you, Officer.

148
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,155
Hello, friends!

149
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,832
I was just...
I was immersed in a game of bridge.

150
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,625
Do you play?

151
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:41,135
Sir, did you try to start your plane again?

152
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,682
Yes, I did.

153
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,018
I'm terribly sorry.

154
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:54,189
I fear I have caused extensive damage
to the house next door.

155
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,817
Handcuffs?

156
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:58,861
I'd rather not.

157
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,487
Hold on.

158
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,701
It's here, somewhere.

159
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,036
Sir?

160
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,207
Found it.

161
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,877
Found it!

162
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,296
Sir...

163
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,560
Sweetie, I'm home. I brought Chinese.

164
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,228
Mum?

165
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,354
Hello.

166
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,732
Hi.

167
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,570
Where did you get the pennies?

168
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,822
The old man next door.

169
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,578
Actually, it was the police officer
who "gave" them to me.

170
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,330
What?

171
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:59,087
What kind of a nut keeps an aeroplane,
and actually starts it, in his backyard?

172
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,340
Are you sure you're okay?

173
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,510
- I have to call the insurance.
- Done.

174
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,929
- And file a police report.
- Done. In duplicate.

175
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,348
- Photo documentation?
- Inside and outside.

176
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,433
The lighting could have been better.

177
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,602
It's not so bad.

178
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:24,780
I'll call a contractor in the morning
and we'll forget the old man even exists.

179
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,406
I've already forgotten him.

180
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,784
Matters of consequence,

181
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,371
let's recap today's recap,
of today's market activity,

182
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,374
with a detailed account...
Numbers of the day.

183
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,428
There are also hundreds of others...

184
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,103
"Once upon a time there was
a little prince who lived on a planet

185
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:42,524
"that was scarcely bigger than himself,
and who had need of..."

186
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,650
A friend?

187
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,028
I thought you could use a friend!

188
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,865
No, here I am, up here.

189
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,826
Here! Hi.

190
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:58,206
I'm sorry.
That's just the beginning of the story.

191
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,876
It's okay. Nobody understands it anyway.

192
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,836
All right, bye-bye.

193
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,213
See you later, maybe.

194
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,056
She made the most frightful noise.

195
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,058
It resounded all over the place.

196
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:27,361
- Maybe during lunch...
- I can count the pennies.

197
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,556
Once upon a time
there was a little prince

198
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,893
who lived on a planet
that was scarcely bigger than himself,

199
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,686
and who had need of a friend.

200
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:27,332
"And I lived my life alone
without anyone I could really talk to.

201
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,252
"So I learned to pilot aeroplanes."

202
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,938
I flew more or less all over the world,

203
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:53,567
until I had an accident
in the Sahara desert.

204
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:03,678
If you please, draw me a sheep!

205
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,851
If you please, draw me a sheep.

206
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,277
Draw me a sheep!

207
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:24,032
When a mystery is too over-powering,
one dare not disobey.

208
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,160
Draw? I don't know how to draw.

209
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,496
That doesn't matter.

210
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,542
The first sheep I drew was too sickly.

211
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,672
And the second one,
not to his liking either.

212
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,800
You see yourself
that this is not a sheep.

213
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,219
This is a ram, it has horns.

214
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:47,514
- And this one was...
- Too old!

215
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:53,812
I want a sheep
that will live for a long time.

216
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,858
So, I drew this.

217
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,531
The sheep you ask for is inside.

218
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,410
That is exactly the way I wanted it!

219
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,957
Do you think this sheep
will eat a great deal of grass?

220
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,168
Because where I live,
everything is very small.

221
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,505
I'm sure there will be
enough grass for him.

222
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,048
He's a very small sheep.

223
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,135
Not that small. Look!
He's gone to sleep.

224
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:10,889
Wow.

225
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,420
Hello?

226
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,932
Hello?

227
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:55,892
Hello!

228
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,611
Hold on. Don't move.

229
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,659
Good.

230
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,327
Here we go.

231
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,205
Wow.

232
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:43,398
I... I just wanted to give
your drawing back.

233
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,567
You don't like it?

234
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,443
It's not that.

235
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,028
It's not very good.

236
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,446
I think it's nice.

237
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,991
I read the story, too. Attentively.

238
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,494
And I found it quite odd.

239
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:58,329
Odd?

240
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:01,124
I mean curious... Or interesting...

241
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,668
I have some issues
with some of the facts.

242
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:05,795
You have questions?

243
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,214
I don't mean to be rude. Can I?

244
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:10,842
What? Be rude?
Sure, go ahead. I'm listening.

245
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:15,054
First of all, what was the kid
doing there in the desert?

246
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,181
It's very strange.

247
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:19,434
No one can last very long
in a desert without food and water.

248
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:22,353
Where are his parents?
Does he even go to school?

249
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,231
Does he really live up there?
I took basic astronomy

250
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:29,068
and there was no mention of life,
or children, on any other planets.

251
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:32,071
Unless it's true
that he came from a star.

252
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,239
But that's unlikely.

253
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,159
Not a star. An asteroid.

254
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,828
Asteroid B-612.

255
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:41,748
We didn't cover asteroids.

256
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:46,836
But the fact that he wanted a sheep,
that pretty much proves that he exists.

257
00:25:47,338 --> 00:25:48,922
Don't you think?

258
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,723
Hold on, I'll show you another drawing.

259
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,188
Wow.

260
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,816
This is a pretty serious fire hazard.

261
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:11,402
I never looked at it that way.

262
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,154
Where did you get all this stuff?

263
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:17,992
As time goes by
some things just kind of stick to you.

264
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,662
There's a name for it...

265
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,163
- Collecting?
- Hoarding!

266
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:23,957
That's it, hoarding.

267
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,834
I'm a hoarder. A bit of a hoarder.

268
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,632
What's your name, little fox?

269
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,009
He can't answer you.

270
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,720
I keep meaning to sew him a mouth.

271
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:53,736
Are you okay? You're okay?

272
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:56,322
I'm fine, this happens sometimes.

273
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,032
Give me a minute.

274
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:01,202
The last time this happened,
I was down here for three days.

275
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:02,704
- Three days?
- That's okay.

276
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:06,624
That's why I always keep
a baloney sandwich in my pocket.

277
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,167
Want a bite?

278
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:11,587
I think I'm baloney intolerant.

279
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,881
You don't know what you're missing.

280
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,930
It's going to be a clear night.

281
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,025
The stars will be out soon.

282
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,861
Wow.

283
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:42,118
The Little Prince,
he was very fond of sunsets.

284
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,371
One day he saw 44 of them.

285
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,081
What?

286
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,375
His planet, it was so small,

287
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,379
all he had to do was move his chair
a few steps to see another one.

288
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:58,217
But a small planet also had drawbacks.

289
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,971
He needed
a sheep to eat the baobab sprouts.

290
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:03,765
- Baobab?
- Yeah.

291
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,725
It's a very greedy tree.

292
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:11,439
And every day, he toiled
to stop them from turning up.

293
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,733
For if you intervene too late...

294
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,943
Catastrophe.

295
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:19,572
Now, luckily, there are good seeds, too.

296
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:24,452
And one day, from a seed blown
from no one knew where,

297
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,830
a new kind of sprout came up.

298
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:37,840
I know you'll be miraculous.

299
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,592
I know you will.

300
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,819
How beautiful you are!

301
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,404
I'm only half awake.

302
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,073
Forgive me, I'm still quite dishevelled.

303
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,533
You're perfect.

304
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,284
Am I not?

305
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:08,830
I was born
at the same moment as the sun.

306
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:18,047
It was there they shared
their first sunrise

307
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,301
and their first sunset.

308
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,180
It's very cold where you live.

309
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,356
Could you be kind enough
to think of my needs?

310
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:39,652
So the Rose began very quickly
to torment him with her vanity.

311
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,904
I suppose you wouldn't have a screen?

312
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,740
And at night I want you
to put me under a glass.

313
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,659
A glass globe, now. My needs...

314
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,994
My beauty... My screen...

315
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,873
Now, the shame of it was
that they loved each other.

316
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:56,502
But they were both too young
to know how to love.

317
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:01,632
Full of doubt, he ran away.

318
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,552
Of course I love you.

319
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:07,263
If you're not aware of that, it's my fault.

320
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,681
Please forgive me.

321
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,026
He left her? All alone?

322
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,487
But where did he go?

323
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,406
He didn't know it at the time,

324
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:29,076
but his leaving was just the first step
on a journey back to her.

325
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,870
- Really?
- Yes.

326
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,332
Look at that, the stars are out.

327
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,048
Wow.

328
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,175
They're so bright.

329
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,762
There are so many to look at.

330
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:52,141
And on a good day, if I listen carefully,

331
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:54,560
I can hear him laughing up there.

332
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,077
No! I have to go!

333
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,922
Sweetie? Where are you?

334
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,095
Hi.

335
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:33,140
Your desk is a mess.
Did you finish your study work for today?

336
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,353
No, not exactly.

337
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,272
What have you been doing?

338
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,941
I read a lot...

339
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,443
And I made a friend.

340
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,280
A friend?

341
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,534
No. No, no, no.

342
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,786
No.

343
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,746
Maybe...

344
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:58,624
Yes.

345
00:31:58,709 --> 00:31:59,792
Okay.

346
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,588
FRIEND

347
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:07,216
If you study hard and you stay
completely on track with the plan,

348
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:10,177
you can spend some time
with your new friend.

349
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:13,347
Next summer,
on Thursdays, from 1:00 to 1:30.

350
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,225
Okay? Can't wait to meet her.

351
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,781
"He found himself
in the neighbourhood of asteroids

352
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:35,036
325, 326, 327,

353
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:40,166
"328, 329, 330..."

354
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,463
What?

355
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,506
Here's a subject.

356
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,467
Approach.

357
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,636
Sire, over what do you rule?

358
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,846
Over everything.

359
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,098
And the stars obey you?

360
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:59,852
They certainly do.
I do not tolerate indiscipline.

361
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,981
I would very much like to see a sunset.

362
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,609
It would remind me of my rose.

363
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,653
Order the sun to set.

364
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,992
You shall have your sunset.

365
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:16,744
I shall command it.

366
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,039
But I shall wait
until conditions are favourable.

367
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,415
When will that be?

368
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,960
Well, that will be about...

369
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:30,091
That will be this evening,
about 20 minutes to 9:00.

370
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,682
Good morning.

371
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,809
You're wearing a funny kind of hat.

372
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:44,689
What... It is a hat for salutes, actually.

373
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:47,191
To raise when people acclaim me.

374
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,903
Clap your hands, yeah.

375
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,240
Thank you. Thank you.

376
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:55,616
You see?

377
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:02,832
Do you really admire me very much?

378
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:07,753
Am I not the handsomest,
the best-dressed, the richest...

379
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:11,048
The most intelligent man on this planet?

380
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,885
But you're the only man on this planet.

381
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,389
Do me this kindness and...

382
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,017
Admire me just the same, please.

383
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,481
I own the stars...

384
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,442
I handle them.

385
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,277
I count them, then I recount them.

386
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:33,946
But what good does that do you?

387
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:37,700
Well, it makes me rich. How's that?

388
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,536
And what good does it
do you to be rich?

389
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:43,789
It makes it possible for me
to buy more stars.

390
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,834
Plus anything else you can think of.

391
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:53,299
Grown-ups are certainly very odd.

392
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:59,430
And check. Check. Check.

393
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:01,807
Check.

394
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,392
Check.

395
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,645
And check. And check.

396
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,232
Check...

397
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:19,784
Grown-ups are certainly very, very odd.

398
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,411
I've lived a great deal among grown-ups.

399
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,955
I have seen them up close.

400
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,541
And that hasn't much changed
my opinion of them.

401
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:31,587
Yes. I'm not so sure
I want to grow up any more.

402
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,923
Growing up is not the problem.

403
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,800
Forgetting is.

404
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:39,303
I definitely don't want to forget.

405
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:43,516
I managed to grow up
and I never forgot the Little Prince.

406
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,566
Yeah...

407
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,013
Good evening.

408
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,227
Good evening.

409
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,770
What planet is this?

410
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,981
This is Earth.

411
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,190
This is Africa.

412
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,318
Where are all the men?

413
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,863
It is a little lonely in the desert.

414
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,156
It is also lonely among men.

415
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:44,410
You are a funny animal.
You are no thicker than a finger.

416
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:50,207
But I am more powerful
than the finger of a king.

417
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,334
You haven't any feet.

418
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,628
You cannot even travel.

419
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:58,132
I can carry you further
than any ship could take you.

420
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,180
I can help you someday,
if you miss your own planet.

421
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,975
I think I understand you.

422
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:15,649
There you go,
try that one on the left there.

423
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,278
I'm scared.

424
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,614
That's normal. It is scary.

425
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,366
Why do you think I sent you?

426
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,496
Almost there. You got it now.

427
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:31,957
Just reach! Reach for it!

428
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,794
- I got it!
- There you go! You got it!

429
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,678
Well, that was...

430
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,722
That was double scary, right?

431
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,516
Triple and quadruple.

432
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,977
We're going to have to amputate them.

433
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:53,729
What?

434
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,820
- Feels better, right?
- Yes.

435
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:15,751
But it happened that after
walking a long time through sand,

436
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,836
and rocks, and snow,

437
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,005
the Fox appeared.

438
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,269
Hey! Come play with me.

439
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,981
I cannot play with you.

440
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:38,691
I am not tamed.

441
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,401
What does that mean?

442
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,487
Tame means, "To establish ties."

443
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,323
To me, you are just a little boy

444
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:49,076
who is just like 100,000 other little boys.

445
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,495
And I have no need of you.

446
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,913
And you have no need of me.

447
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:57,418
To you, I am just a fox
like 100,000 foxes.

448
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:01,046
But if you tame me,
then we shall need each other.

449
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,234
Hey, there.

450
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,471
To me,
you will be unique in all the world.

451
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,557
And to you,
I shall be unique in all the world.

452
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,527
Who are you?

453
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,863
We are roses.

454
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:36,326
My rose is just a common rose?

455
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:40,914
But she told me she was the only one of
her kind in the whole universe.

456
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,334
But she is not a common rose.

457
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,586
She is your rose.

458
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:49,923
The time that you have devoted to her
makes your rose so important.

459
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:52,759
She is my rose.

460
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,220
You must return to her.

461
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,980
Are you going to cry?

462
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:09,318
My taming you
has done you no good at all.

463
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,782
Let me make you a present of a secret.

464
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:20,162
It's very simple.

465
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,956
It is only with the heart
that one can see rightly.

466
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:26,668
What is essential is invisible to the eye.

467
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,132
They won't be together any more?

468
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,010
But they will.

469
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:39,723
The Fox, he sees the Little Prince
when he looks with his heart.

470
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:43,435
If you can do that,
you'll never be lonely again.

471
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,648
Right. But I'm not lonely.
I've got you now.

472
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,275
I am so lucky.

473
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,029
I thought I'd never find anyone
who wanted to hear my story.

474
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:57,032
Then you came along. Just in time.

475
00:42:58,826 --> 00:42:59,910
Wait...

476
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,413
What do you mean, "Just in time"?

477
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:11,588
Well, everyone has
to say goodbye sooner or later.

478
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:13,966
You're leaving?

479
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,218
Well...

480
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:19,888
What if I get that old plane running?

481
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,474
What if it's time for me

482
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:25,852
to go be with the Little Prince?

483
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,021
But...

484
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,148
He already has his rose...

485
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,193
And I need you here.

486
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:41,743
Hey. Hey.

487
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:43,996
You hungry?

488
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,831
I know a great place

489
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:49,001
where we can get
free pancakes on your birthday.

490
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:51,878
But my birthday's not for two weeks.

491
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:53,463
They don't know that.

492
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,516
It's like flying a plane.

493
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,313
Like the one you crashed?

494
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,647
Exactly!

495
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:57,277
You're joking?

496
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:08,705
Pull over.

497
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,386
Do you have a driver's licence?

498
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,595
No.

499
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,348
- A learner's permit?
- No.

500
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,557
How old are you?

501
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:31,103
- Hi, Officer.
- Your car is out of the garage, again.

502
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:32,562
Yeah...

503
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:36,358
Good afternoon, Officer.
If I may say something...

504
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,902
It's my birthday today.

505
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,991
- Mum, I can...
- Wait for me inside.

506
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,410
- But...
- Now.

507
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,747
I'm very sorry to call you at work.

508
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,750
Apparently, they were going
to get pancakes...

509
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:58,505
- Would you like to speak to him?
- Yes...

510
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,550
No! No, no!

511
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:12,185
Mr Fox!

512
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:16,481
According to this, you're still in bed.

513
00:46:16,566 --> 00:46:17,941
Asleep. Yesterday.

514
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:22,654
Your "friend" doesn't even
have a driver's licence.

515
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,699
No. They took it away
after the fourth time

516
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,618
he drove away
with the gas pump attached.

517
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:32,080
You could have been killed!

518
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:35,083
- Mum, I can explain...
- No, you mean you can lie.

519
00:46:35,168 --> 00:46:36,751
- But...
- You lied to me,

520
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,336
to the police officer.

521
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,922
And before I forget, happy birthday.

522
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:45,093
You even managed
to lie to your life plan!

523
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:48,096
That? It's just a board full of magnets!

524
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,307
You care more
about that than about me.

525
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:51,892
You're wrong.

526
00:46:52,185 --> 00:46:55,103
I care about it
as much as I care about you.

527
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:56,980
It is you.

528
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:00,817
This is your life and I'm the only one
taking any responsibility for it!

529
00:47:01,194 --> 00:47:04,654
That's your version of my life, not mine!

530
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:07,616
If you were ever around, you'd see that!

531
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,036
You know full well
why I have to work so hard.

532
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,497
You're just like him now.

533
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,916
Too busy, always working.

534
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,376
How long until you
completely disappear?

535
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:27,052
"I believe
that for his escape he took advantage

536
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,846
"of the migration
of a flock of wild birds?"

537
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,765
No, no!

538
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:34,351
Okay, enough of this nonsense.

539
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:36,561
You have two weeks to focus.

540
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:37,979
But, Mum!

541
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:12,073
LOVE,
DAD

542
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:55,075
Let's look for a well.

543
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:35,073
The stars are beautiful because
of a flower that cannot be seen.

544
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:46,543
What makes the desert beautiful
is that somewhere it hides a well.

545
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:54,092
In the moonlight, I looked
at his pale forehead, his closed eyes,

546
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,429
his locks of hair
that trembled in the wind,

547
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,264
and I said to myself,

548
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:02,892
"What I see here is nothing but a shell.

549
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,814
"What is most important
is what is invisible."

550
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:22,871
We found a well at daybreak.

551
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:33,381
The men where you live
grow thousands of roses

552
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:36,676
and they do not find
what they are looking for.

553
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:42,015
What they are looking for
could be found in a single rose,

554
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,767
or a little water.

555
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:16,424
Hold your horses.

556
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:21,304
Let's go look for a well.

557
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,348
No. Listen.

558
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:26,226
I made a big mistake the other day.

559
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,770
You can't come over here any more.

560
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:31,314
- This will be the last time.
- What?

561
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,691
Let's get that plane running!

562
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:41,783
If you managed to find a well
in the middle of the desert,

563
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,244
then we can go
and find the Little Prince.

564
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,622
He'll be able to help us.

565
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:51,543
Wait, little one. We can't just take off.

566
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,461
You're right.

567
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:55,296
We must fix that wing first.

568
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:56,631
No, no.

569
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:02,762
I'm sorry, but when
the moment does come for me to leave,

570
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:05,431
I have to go alone.

571
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:10,353
But I won't be any trouble,

572
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,231
and I won't take up much room
in the plane. I promise.

573
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:14,899
Don't go without me.

574
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:20,780
I think it's time I told you
the end of the story.

575
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:30,290
That evening, I finished fixing my plane
and I went to find the Little Prince.

576
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:32,876
I shall be there tonight. Wait for me.

577
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,670
You're sure I won't suffer too long?

578
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:47,807
Did you shoot it?

579
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:50,560
No, it disappeared among the stones.

580
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,103
What happened?

581
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:56,274
Somehow,
he knew that I had fixed my plane.

582
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,615
I, too, am going back home today.

583
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:05,158
It is much farther.

584
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,951
It is much more difficult.

585
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:09,829
I am afraid.

586
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:17,503
I can't believe
I'll never hear you laugh again.

587
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,256
I'm going to give you a present.

588
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,886
In one of those stars, I shall be living.

589
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:27,722
In one of them, I shall be laughing.

590
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:31,225
And so, when you look up
at the sky at night,

591
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:34,604
it will be as if all the
stars are laughing.

592
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:44,405
Tonight, do not come.

593
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:47,533
You let him go? Not to the Snake!

594
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,161
It wasn't my choice.

595
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:53,039
It was time to say goodbye.

596
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,627
You understand that it is too far?

597
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:01,005
I cannot carry this body with me.

598
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:04,008
It will be like an old abandoned shell.

599
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:07,136
There is nothing sad about old shells.

600
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:22,777
- Here's the place.
- I shall not leave you.

601
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,763
But...

602
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:53,683
You...

603
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,068
You said he's up there, didn't you?

604
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:05,403
Back with his rose?

605
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:06,529
Well...

606
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,198
It is as he said.

607
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:12,118
I look at the stars
and I hear him laughing.

608
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,996
But you don't know for sure?

609
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:20,501
It would comfort me
very much to know for sure,

610
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:24,630
but instead,
I choose to believe he is up there.

611
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:31,304
Is that what you want me to do
when you go?

612
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,306
Just look up to the stars

613
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:36,225
and make-believe that you're not gone?

614
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:37,810
But...

615
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:42,231
If you look with your heart,
I'll always be with you.

616
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:47,070
Yes. Just like I know the Little Prince
will always be with his rose.

617
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:49,864
But you can't know for sure.

618
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,700
What if he's not back with his rose?

619
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:55,244
- What if he's all grown up and alone?
- But...

620
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:58,372
What if he's lost
and he's forgotten everything?

621
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,834
Wait. Hold on, My little girl. Hold on.

622
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:04,212
The Little Prince will never forget.

623
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:07,173
He'll always be up there for us,
to help us.

624
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,843
I don't want his help.
I hate the Little Prince!

625
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:13,513
I wasted my whole summer on
the Little Prince!

626
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:16,891
I wish you had never told me
this stupid story.

627
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,260
LAST DAY OF SUMMER HOLIDAYS

628
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:58,015
The weather caused
32 people to be late for work.

629
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,561
Productivity decreased by 0.4%.

630
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:11,404
What...

631
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:12,738
Dear!

632
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:14,240
No...

633
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:22,623
Sweetie...

634
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,964
No!

635
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:48,524
Sweetie!

636
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:56,115
Hey!

637
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,883
Sweetie, stop!
What are you doing? Stop!

638
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,396
Stop! You can't go!

639
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:29,732
Please, I need you here!

640
00:59:30,651 --> 00:59:31,484
No!

641
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,487
Please! You have to let me see him!

642
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,073
What happened? Will he be okay?

643
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:46,666
So...

644
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:51,712
Let's not forget,
tomorrow's an important day.

645
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:30,209
The Aviator needs you.

646
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,463
I'm going to find you.

647
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:37,318
Wow.

648
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,471
Do you know how to fly a plane?

649
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:11,143
Yeah, I didn't think so.

650
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:13,979
Okay, well...

651
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:22,029
Yes! I can do this.

652
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,156
Here, hold these.

653
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:46,655
I think I've got the hang of it now.

654
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:12,014
I've got you!

655
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:26,946
Where are the stars?

656
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:32,952
What is that?

657
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:37,665
A star?

658
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,794
Wait a minute. That's no star.

659
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,699
The Aviator never mentioned this place.

660
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:19,331
Could it be?

661
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:23,544
It's him! It's him!

662
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,754
What is he doing here?

663
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,674
Buckle up.

664
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,024
We need a gap.

665
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:50,613
I think I see one up ahead.

666
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,288
Prepare for landing.

667
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,211
We did it!

668
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:31,278
That wasn't too bad.

669
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,614
Look! Up there.

670
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,254
Step out of the vehicle.

671
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,925
I said step out of the vehicle.

672
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:55,594
I'm very sorry, Officer.
If I could just explain...

673
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:58,180
Keep your hands where I can see them.

674
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:07,815
Unsafe speeding. Unsafe lane changes.

675
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:10,025
- Unsafe everything.
- What?

676
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,360
Running multiple red lights.

677
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:14,088
- I'm trying to find my friend...
- Destruction of city property.

678
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:16,782
A friend of a friend.
We've never officially met.

679
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,993
No use of turn signals. No signals at all.

680
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,954
I just wanted to grab him
and take him home.

681
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:26,166
Attempted kidnapping!
Add that to the list.

682
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,377
Attempted kidnapping.

683
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,631
Hey, are you...

684
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:37,386
Thank you.

685
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:38,637
The Conceited Man.

686
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:44,143
Disobeying a uniformed officer,
of the law, no less.

687
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:45,644
Me!

688
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:47,146
Wait.

689
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:49,022
Why are you not on your planet?

690
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:56,196
- Why are you so small?
- Because I'm a child.

691
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:01,577
That is absolutely not allowed here.

692
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:05,247
- Let's go!
- Hey! Hey!

693
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,500
Not so fast!

694
01:08:15,884 --> 01:08:17,843
Thank you. Thank you.

695
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,512
That's right. Go on.

696
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,232
We need a disguise.

697
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:55,547
Excuse me. Excuse me.

698
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:58,050
Sorry. Could I... Sir?

699
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,762
Here are my subjects.

700
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:03,138
Approach.

701
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:04,640
Is that the King?

702
01:09:05,934 --> 01:09:07,392
- 67th floor.
- As you wish.

703
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:08,936
- 27th floor.
- Granted.

704
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:10,521
- 14th floor.
- Certainly.

705
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:12,231
- 142nd floor.
- Of course.

706
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:13,774
- 34th floor.
- Happily.

707
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,486
No.

708
01:09:19,906 --> 01:09:22,157
Top floor, please.

709
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,911
What? Top floor?

710
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,748
When conditions are favourable?

711
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:31,124
Your Majesty?

712
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:34,837
Well...

713
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:39,174
Conditions are favourable.

714
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:43,345
It is done.

715
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:07,536
There he is!

716
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:16,503
Little Prince! Little Prince!

717
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:18,130
What?

718
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:23,135
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm okay.

719
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:25,888
My chin.

720
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:28,390
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

721
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:32,311
I was just...
I was just taking a little break, that's all.

722
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:34,354
I thought you were someone else.

723
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:35,564
You did?

724
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:38,817
That's great! That's great.

725
01:10:39,527 --> 01:10:40,819
Please don't report me.

726
01:10:40,904 --> 01:10:43,322
Break's over. See? I'm working.

727
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:46,325
Work, work, work.

728
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,660
No need to report me.

729
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:50,829
I don't think it was him.

730
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:52,664
What are we going to do now?

731
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:57,002
Mr Prince?

732
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,757
Can it be?

733
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:03,508
Excuse me?

734
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:09,348
Darn it!

735
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,769
I think you dropped this.

736
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,854
My badge!

737
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:19,399
- Catastrophe.
- It is him.

738
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:22,319
- Can I...
- What happened to you?

739
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:24,071
Give me that. Please.

740
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:26,114
The Aviator's not going to like this.

741
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:29,326
- Give it!
- You're not supposed to be like this.

742
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,244
Come on, give me that!

743
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:33,038
Thank you.

744
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,792
How does this work?

745
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,878
I'm working. See? I'm being essential.

746
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:42,381
- Wait, stop!
- No, don't talk to me.

747
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:43,799
I know who you are!

748
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:46,043
You're the Little Prince,
and you're afraid of baobabs!

749
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:48,887
No... I'm Mr Prince,
the maintenance man.

750
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:50,597
I'm afraid of the Businessman.

751
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,100
An aviator drew you a sheep!

752
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:54,601
You ask too many questions!

753
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:56,728
You travel
with a flock of migrating birds.

754
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:59,398
Go away. Excuse me! I am very busy.

755
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,901
You tamed a fox. A fox like him!

756
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:04,111
Never had a pet.

757
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:07,155
He wasn't your pet, he was your friend.

758
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:10,325
Does it look like I have time for friends?

759
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:11,576
I'm working!

760
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:14,746
No!

761
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,916
That was my last brush!

762
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:21,086
I'm going to get fired.

763
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:23,088
This was my last chance.

764
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:27,009
This is so unfair!
I was just doing my job.

765
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:30,178
- Actually, there's one more...
- Thank you.

766
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:32,514
- Now I have to get back to work.
- Wait!

767
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,100
You know what?
You're slowing down my productivity!

768
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,519
You had a rose!

769
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,438
A what?

770
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:40,772
A rose.

771
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:44,109
A really beautiful one. Miraculous even.

772
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:46,445
One that was unique in all the world.

773
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,323
You know, I've heard
quite enough of this nonsense.

774
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:52,117
I have to work. Thank you.

775
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:54,619
You've forgotten everything!

776
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:56,955
I'm very busy. I have responsibilities.

777
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,623
You've become just another grown-up!

778
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,000
Give me that.

779
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:05,005
No!

780
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:13,388
Why did you do that?

781
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:15,474
Why did you do...

782
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:19,311
It's all right, I won't cry.

783
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:22,564
I won't cry.
I'm a grown-up. Men don't cry.

784
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:28,320
My brushes got knocked over.
It's not a reason to cry.

785
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:31,656
Crying is useless.

786
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:41,333
Blow.

787
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:48,256
Wait a minute, why are you so short?

788
01:13:49,217 --> 01:13:51,093
- Are you really old?
- What?

789
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:53,762
No! I'm a child.

790
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:55,847
Just like you're supposed to be.

791
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,432
You're a child?

792
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:01,103
Children are certainly very odd.

793
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:03,355
This is not good.

794
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:06,191
I think I know someone who can help.

795
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:11,863
Are you sure about this?

796
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:23,208
Mr Prince,

797
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:25,919
what a pleasant surprise.

798
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:31,424
This child needs your help.

799
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,218
Does she?

800
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,890
Here, we don't
normally allow little dogs.

801
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:42,811
But for you,
we will make an exception, won't we?

802
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:46,273
Delightful.

803
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:48,900
Come in, come in!

804
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,738
So how have you been? Things good?

805
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:55,824
I love my job cleaning the roof.

806
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:58,118
Wonderful, wonderful.

807
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:10,589
- Anything inessential...
- Must be made essential.

808
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:12,632
Well done, Mr Prince.

809
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:21,057
You see, it's really a magnificent thing
the Businessman has created here.

810
01:15:21,142 --> 01:15:24,102
You might even call it a work of art.

811
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,980
But of course, you'd be wrong.

812
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:29,608
Very wrong.

813
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:31,776
Nothing so trivial as that.

814
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:32,944
My plane!

815
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:37,115
It's much more important.
Much more essential.

816
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:40,368
No! Wait!

817
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,370
How could you?
You said you would help.

818
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:43,622
GRADUATES

819
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:45,290
I am. That's how they helped me!

820
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,336
Mr Prince!

821
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:52,464
It seems that
you've finally done something...

822
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:56,635
Let go.

823
01:15:58,346 --> 01:16:01,139
You'll tell the Businessman?
How essential I've been?

824
01:16:01,349 --> 01:16:03,975
Yes, I most certainly will.

825
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:08,021
The Businessman told me about

826
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:11,483
this evidence of childhood
you brought with you.

827
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,152
- Please! Those are important!
- No!

828
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:16,238
There is nothing essential in here at all.

829
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,076
It is time

830
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:23,203
to grow up.

831
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:26,998
THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE
TO EVERYTHING ESSENTIAL

832
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:30,919
How could everything essential
fit into just one book?

833
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:33,171
It is incredibly succinct.

834
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:35,090
And single-spaced.

835
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:40,178
I'm supposed to read this
over and over and over, until I'm old?

836
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:41,513
Not at all.

837
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:46,685
Here, we take a more
accelerated approach to growing up.

838
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:51,940
Isn't that right, Mr Prince?

839
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:53,942
No, never mind.

840
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:57,445
Those blank eyes,
you've forgotten everything, haven't you?

841
01:17:04,287 --> 01:17:08,123
Now, you're going to feel a slight pinch.
Just relax.

842
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:10,375
Yes! Please sign there.

843
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:13,003
A consent form releasing myself,
the Businessman,

844
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:15,338
- and the corporation from all liability...
- Help!

845
01:17:15,423 --> 01:17:16,881
...in case of accidental death

846
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:19,718
or dismemberment during
the centralising process.

847
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:21,928
I'm trying to help you!

848
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:24,723
You're going to make
a wonderful grown-up.

849
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:28,059
Leave them!

850
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:32,981
I said, leave them!

851
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:36,318
Act your age, Mr Prince!

852
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:38,820
Remember, you are
a graduate of my class.

853
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:43,491
Stop! What do you think you're doing?

854
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:51,791
Return to your desk, please.

855
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:02,344
I didn't think that through.

856
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:05,847
The Businessman
is going to be very disappointed in me.

857
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:08,933
Thank you. But why?

858
01:18:09,769 --> 01:18:12,729
I never knew what this was,
or where I even got it,

859
01:18:12,813 --> 01:18:15,190
but I thought maybe it was important...

860
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:17,067
Your sheep!

861
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:18,526
My sheep?

862
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:20,987
I don't get it.

863
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:23,031
The Aviator gave it to you

864
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:25,533
in the desert on Earth,
to eat the baobabs.

865
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:28,036
- Catastrophe.
- Catastrophe.

866
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:29,454
That's right.

867
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,831
The Aviator drew all of these for you.

868
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:36,294
- He really needs you right now.
- Me? He needs me?

869
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:43,551
Growing up is not the problem.
Forgetting is.

870
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:48,890
I have an idea.

871
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:51,976
We just need... My plane!

872
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:56,356
There it is!

873
01:18:57,191 --> 01:18:58,566
It's okay.

874
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:06,991
Hurry!

875
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:35,061
We did it!

876
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:41,526
No!

877
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:48,199
Which button?

878
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:55,540
No, no, no...

879
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:23,735
Yes!

880
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:27,906
We can catch it on top of the next pile!

881
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,241
Wait, where's Mr Prince?

882
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:42,962
I remember these.

883
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:45,757
The stars.

884
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,425
What are they all doing here?

885
01:20:54,141 --> 01:20:56,935
Look at the stars.
The stars are beautiful...

886
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:58,853
The stars are beautiful

887
01:20:58,938 --> 01:21:01,773
because of a flower
that cannot be seen.

888
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:06,277
Because of a flower
that cannot be seen?

889
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:07,654
Your rose!

890
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,532
I have a rose...

891
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:14,035
I see you've found my collection,

892
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:19,332
501,622,731 stars.

893
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:22,502
You? You did this?

894
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:24,671
But you're supposed
to just count the stars.

895
01:21:24,964 --> 01:21:29,551
Own! Say it with me.
Own. I own the stars.

896
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:33,888
Thank you. Thank you.

897
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:38,977
They used to be merely
little golden objects in the sky

898
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:42,564
that set lazy men to idle dreaming.

899
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:47,485
But now, the stars
have finally been made essential.

900
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:49,862
Where did you get that?

901
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:52,740
She's curious.

902
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:54,826
Isn't that just like a child?

903
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,122
No!

904
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:00,248
Thank you.

905
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:01,708
All right! Enough.

906
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:04,002
- Thank you.
- All right!

907
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:06,170
Enough!

908
01:22:08,549 --> 01:22:11,342
What are you going to do
with all the stars?

909
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:14,012
Don't worry, my little girl.

910
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:16,431
I put the stars to good use.

911
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:39,454
There. You see? The inessential has
become perfectly essential.

912
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:42,540
How it should be for all things.

913
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:44,375
Take her back to the classroom.

914
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,210
Make sure no one interferes.

915
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:49,714
- No! Put me down. I can't...
- Stop!

916
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:52,717
- Don't let them do this to me.
- I said stop.

917
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:55,053
- Wait.
- Wait?

918
01:22:55,763 --> 01:22:58,473
I've given you 371 jobs,

919
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:01,601
and you have been fired
from 370 of them.

920
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:05,396
I think it's time you get back to work,
my little failure.

921
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:08,191
No! Leave him!

922
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:09,734
Stop wriggling.

923
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:12,570
Stop!

924
01:23:12,946 --> 01:23:15,573
- Take your hands off her.
- What? Stop?

925
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:18,910
I'm not a failure. I'm...

926
01:23:19,286 --> 01:23:20,411
I'm the Little Prince.

927
01:23:20,663 --> 01:23:21,663
What?

928
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:26,834
He thinks he's little, and a prince!

929
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:32,131
Wonderful.

930
01:23:32,299 --> 01:23:34,717
Look at me! I'm a bumble bee.

931
01:23:34,802 --> 01:23:37,345
What are you? A duck?

932
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:43,935
He's hopeless.

933
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:48,439
I'm not hopeless, I'm hopeful!

934
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:51,609
That's right! I'm full of hope!

935
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:54,028
And I love a rose!

936
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:56,489
And she loves me,
and she is waiting for me!

937
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,366
So...

938
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,284
I don't think I want to work
for you any more.

939
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:02,286
So...

940
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:04,455
I quit!

941
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:10,294
I quit!

942
01:24:17,845 --> 01:24:18,845
That pile!

943
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:26,811
When are you going to forget about
being a child?

944
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:28,521
Never!

945
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:32,483
Sorry, Mr Prince!

946
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:36,320
No, it's my fault.
My face shouldn't have been there.

947
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:37,572
Good.

948
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:46,914
No.

949
01:24:51,670 --> 01:24:52,920
I'm scared.

950
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:10,938
Hang on!

951
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:23,951
- I'll be right back!
- Where are you going?

952
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:26,370
Wait! Where are you going?

953
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:29,040
That's not good.

954
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:40,802
I will grow up, but I'll never
be a grown-up like you!

955
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:55,066
Wow!

956
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:13,459
No!

957
01:26:20,801 --> 01:26:21,926
Got you!

958
01:26:32,145 --> 01:26:33,187
I got you, too.

959
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:03,718
Wonderful.

960
01:27:15,314 --> 01:27:18,858
This is very, very bad for business.

961
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:23,696
That was amazing!

962
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:28,868
The stars are back.

963
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:32,997
I forgot how beautiful they are.

964
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:38,628
- Look! Asteroid 325!
- You remember!

965
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:40,338
And 326!

966
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:43,341
And 327!

967
01:27:43,884 --> 01:27:44,967
And 328!

968
01:27:45,052 --> 01:27:46,677
It's working!

969
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:50,598
Look! B-612!

970
01:27:53,018 --> 01:27:54,101
The baobabs.

971
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,901
Your rose! She's there!

972
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:04,195
Hold on!

973
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:06,530
You're not going to try and land,
are you?

974
01:28:08,367 --> 01:28:11,535
No, stop! Turn around! Stop!

975
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:21,128
What's happening?

976
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:24,048
I think we're falling.

977
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:28,886
- Where are you going now?
- Sit still.

978
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:53,661
Let's go.

979
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:16,934
Over here! I found her!

980
01:29:22,816 --> 01:29:23,899
Look.

981
01:29:25,277 --> 01:29:26,485
My rose.

982
01:29:35,454 --> 01:29:36,787
It's her.

983
01:30:06,276 --> 01:30:07,318
No...

984
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:17,828
No, how can this be?

985
01:30:22,459 --> 01:30:24,668
I'm so sorry.

986
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,672
You're supposed to be with her.

987
01:30:33,136 --> 01:30:35,346
I'm going to lose him, too.

988
01:30:38,183 --> 01:30:39,642
And grow up.

989
01:30:41,228 --> 01:30:42,728
And forget all about him.

990
01:30:45,232 --> 01:30:46,899
Forget everything

991
01:30:47,317 --> 01:30:48,651
forever.

992
01:30:51,071 --> 01:30:53,197
I don't want to lose him.

993
01:30:55,075 --> 01:30:56,158
Don't cry.

994
01:31:00,205 --> 01:31:02,373
How can you not be crying?

995
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:34,864
I can see her.

996
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,373
She was not a common rose.

997
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:48,752
She was the only one of her kind
in the whole universe.

998
01:31:51,381 --> 01:31:52,965
I remember her.

999
01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:55,050
I remember all of it.

1000
01:31:55,594 --> 01:31:56,760
She's not gone.

1001
01:31:57,762 --> 01:31:58,888
She's still here?

1002
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:00,681
It is only with the heart
that one can see rightly.

1003
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:03,601
What is essential is invisible to the eye.

1004
01:32:08,607 --> 01:32:10,274
He'll always be with me.

1005
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:13,611
I understand now.

1006
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:30,127
- Please tell the Aviator I remember him!
- I will!

1007
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:32,171
Don't forget.

1008
01:32:32,505 --> 01:32:33,672
I won't!

1009
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:36,467
I won't forget any of it! I promise.

1010
01:33:12,963 --> 01:33:14,088
Sweetie?

1011
01:33:14,172 --> 01:33:15,214
Yes?

1012
01:33:15,966 --> 01:33:18,175
- We're late.
- What?

1013
01:33:18,635 --> 01:33:19,677
No, we're not.

1014
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:22,179
We need to stop by the hospital
before school.

1015
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:31,855
122, 123, 124...

1016
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:35,734
Okay.

1017
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:40,758
You're here.

1018
01:34:43,595 --> 01:34:44,636
I'm sorry.

1019
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:48,557
I'm so sorry for what I said.

1020
01:34:50,769 --> 01:34:52,936
I don't even remember.

1021
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:55,481
That's sweet.

1022
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:59,234
No, I don't even remember who you are.

1023
01:35:01,446 --> 01:35:04,239
I got you, didn't I?

1024
01:35:08,495 --> 01:35:10,788
I've got something to show you.

1025
01:35:26,262 --> 01:35:27,638
You did this?

1026
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:37,314
All my drawings, all in order?

1027
01:35:41,694 --> 01:35:44,154
This is so wonderful.

1028
01:35:50,036 --> 01:35:51,495
Sweetheart.

1029
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:58,502
"You run the risk of weeping a little,
if you let yourself get tamed."

1030
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:08,053
You're going to make
a wonderful grown-up.

1031
01:36:17,313 --> 01:36:18,814
Thank you.

1032
01:36:20,692 --> 01:36:22,192
Did you see this?

1033
01:36:29,576 --> 01:36:31,160
It's wonderful.

1034
01:36:31,327 --> 01:36:33,662
Look. You see? That's the fox.

1035
01:36:34,539 --> 01:36:35,914
My fox.

1036
01:37:55,245 --> 01:37:58,956
The End

1037
01:38:55,138 --> 01:38:58,390
You probably think
this is a hat, but it's not.
