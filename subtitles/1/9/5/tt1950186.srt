<i>If he keeps this pace up
he could have a chance at the...</i>

8
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,796
He's coming in. He's coming in.

9
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:30,958
Let's go!

10
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,338
I know you're tired.
Come on! Let's make it fast!

11
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:35,273
Go! Go! Go!

12
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,997
She's running a little hot.

13
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,156
Fire!

14
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:43,729
Give him blanket.

15
00:01:45,207 --> 00:01:47,281
Get it off me! Off!

16
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:50,400
You okay?

17
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:54,539
Fill the tank!

18
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,024
- Shelby, you just...
- Am I on fire?

19
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:01,648
- Am I on goddamn fire?
- No, you're not...

20
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:03,892
Fill the tank!

21
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,231
- Where am I, Eddie?
- 2 laps up by Frank.

22
00:02:08,232 --> 00:02:10,423
We're good. Go get them.

23
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:37,168
<i>Aston Martin #5 driven by Carroll Shelby
is maintaining his lead</i>

24
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:39,452
<i>as we are hearing
the final minutes of the race.</i>

25
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:41,134
Shelby.

26
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:45,134
<i>The crown is at their feet.</i>

27
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:47,230
- Shelby.
- <i>Takes the title.</i>

28
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:49,025
<i>An American wins Le Mans!</i>

29
00:02:49,026 --> 00:02:50,489
Shelby!

30
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,376
- Carroll Shelby.
- What?

31
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:55,767
This is something
you can't ignore anymore.

32
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,342
I take the pills. The pills work.

33
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:01,949
An elevated heart rate, say 130 BPM

34
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,095
sustained even for a short period,
you run a critical risk of cardiac arrest.

35
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:08,665
- I'll race shorter format then.
- That's not gonna work.

36
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,435
I can race NASCAR, Formula 1.

37
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:15,312
The valve is shot, Shelby.
This is as serious as it gets.

38
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:18,292
In my opinion you're lucky
to be sitting here today.

39
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,546
I feel real lucky.

40
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:24,804
Luckiest guy on Earth.

41
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:49,248
There's a point at 7000 RPM
where everything fades.

42
00:03:57,256 --> 00:04:02,437
The machine becomes weightless.
Just disappears.

43
00:04:10,288 --> 00:04:15,673
And all that's left is a body
moving through space and time.

44
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:23,873
7000 RPM.

45
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:26,979
That's where you meet it.

46
00:04:29,977 --> 00:04:32,510
It asks you a question.

47
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:35,406
The only question that matters.

48
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,715
"Who are you"?

49
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:49,319
Now it's Von Trips in the Ferrari
coming into the corkscrew.

50
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,566
He is breaking late,

51
00:04:52,724 --> 00:04:55,273
He's set a new lap record!

52
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:57,770
No, you don't!

53
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,079
A month ago this car was fun.

54
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,748
Now, it won't even start.
And when it does it's...

55
00:05:05,883 --> 00:05:10,028
When I pull out of the driveway
the dog has a heart attack.

56
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:13,011
All I'm asking is for you
to make it like it was.

57
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:15,984
You've cocked up the inlet valves
and the cloaks...

58
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:18,451
Nothing wrong with the car.
It's the way it's being driven.

59
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:19,596
The way it's being driven?

60
00:05:19,597 --> 00:05:21,937
Too much fuel and not enough spark.
That's what's making her misfire.

61
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:24,091
You wanna run that
by me in English?

62
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,623
All right, sir.

63
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:33,498
That there... That is a sport car.

64
00:05:33,597 --> 00:05:35,782
You have to drive her like a sport car.

65
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:38,802
If you drive her like a school teacher,
she'll clog up.

66
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:42,567
Try changing up at 5000 RPM, not two.

67
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:48,259
Drive like you mean it.
Hard, tight, she'll run clean.

68
00:05:48,643 --> 00:05:52,349
Are you telling me
I don't know how to drive my own car?

69
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:54,498
No.

70
00:05:54,825 --> 00:06:00,518
But if you ask me, this isn't your car.
Your car is more Plymouth, Studebaker.

71
00:06:02,054 --> 00:06:04,255
You and me have a problem, buddy?

72
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:07,660
I don't have a problem.
I run MG. Mine's just fine.

73
00:06:07,661 --> 00:06:10,975
Screw you you limey prick!
I want my money back!

74
00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:13,281
Behave. I'd give it to ya.

75
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:15,458
But you haven't paid
for last months service yet.

76
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,213
This country,
the customer is always right.

77
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:20,357
- You ever hear of that?
- Yeah.

78
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,056
Utter nonsense.

79
00:06:23,057 --> 00:06:28,039
And remember, I advanced the timing,
so, smidge twitchy in first!

80
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:32,322
Give her revs up. Good lad. Return.

81
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,957
Ciao.

82
00:06:37,126 --> 00:06:39,544
Another satisfied customer?

83
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,688
Can I help you, Miss?

84
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:47,978
Wasn't that an MGA 1500?

85
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:51,847
You know your cars.

86
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,650
I like them.

87
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:57,876
I love the sound they make.
The way it goes right through you.

88
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,774
That vibration.

89
00:07:03,212 --> 00:07:08,758
Mine's the
wood paneled Country Squire.

90
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:11,101
Across the street.

91
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,076
The real huprod.

92
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:15,377
Oh, yeah?

93
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:17,140
- Is it fast?
- Very.

94
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,615
Wait a second.
What type of girl are you?

95
00:07:20,828 --> 00:07:23,525
Type of girl who likes the smell
of wet gasoline.

96
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,047
Burnt rubber.

97
00:07:25,048 --> 00:07:28,012
Are you some kind of a deviant?

98
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,616
Only since I married you.

99
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:40,229
Hey, Garry.
What's going on?

100
00:07:55,627 --> 00:07:57,753
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

101
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,879
Shut it down, Mr. Beebe.

102
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:17,449
John!

103
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:35,961
Hear that?

104
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:42,770
That's the sound
of the Ford Motor Company

105
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:45,156
out of business.

106
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:56,010
In 1899 my grandfather
Henry my God Ford

107
00:08:56,238 --> 00:09:01,584
was walking home from Edison Illumination
after working a double shift.

108
00:09:01,826 --> 00:09:03,907
He was ruminating.

109
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:09,285
That morning he had himself an idea
that changed the world.

110
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,678
65 years and 47 million
automobiles later,

111
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,721
what shall be his legacy?

112
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:23,580
Gettin' it in the tailpipe
from a Chevy Impala.

113
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,601
Here's what I want you to do.
Walk home.

114
00:09:34,401 --> 00:09:38,527
While you're walking
I want you to ruminate.

115
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:45,162
Man comes to my office with an idea.
That man keeps his job.

116
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:50,451
Rest of you second best
losers stay home.

117
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:53,228
You don't belong in Ford.

118
00:10:02,358 --> 00:10:04,118
Shelby.

119
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:09,707
I see you. Open up, buddy.

120
00:10:12,156 --> 00:10:13,612
- Hey.
- Go away.

121
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,231
Come on. You can do it.

122
00:10:17,174 --> 00:10:18,470
Come on, baby.

123
00:10:18,471 --> 00:10:22,299
8:30 AM, time to row.
Let's go!

124
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:24,803
- Let's go! Let's go! Go! Go!
- Go away!

125
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:27,664
It's 8:30 AM, baby. Time to row.

126
00:10:28,512 --> 00:10:29,991
Come on.

127
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:32,983
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, Bob.

128
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,646
Is Shelby here?

129
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:36,655
It's touch and go.

130
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,457
Shelby. You're up bright and early.

131
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:48,213
Early bird gets the worm, Pops.

132
00:10:52,073 --> 00:10:53,734
All right, who are you worried about?

133
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,924
You got Red Faris and Bill Rushton.
They're all in 327's.

134
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,638
Corvettes. What about Bondurant?

135
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,321
Bondurant, he's still driving...

136
00:11:01,322 --> 00:11:03,764
Mr. Shelby, can I get an autograph?

137
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:06,050
number 614.

138
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,407
All right, just relax, all right?

139
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:10,282
We gonna eat
those 'vettes for breakfast.

140
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:13,671
We're lighter, we're faster.
That don't work - we're nastier.

141
00:11:18,527 --> 00:11:21,441
Hey, Bill.
Take it easy on us today, bud.

142
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,761
All right.

143
00:11:26,762 --> 00:11:29,877
Paragraph 15.4 Section 2B
of the SCCA standard

144
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:36,296
dictates all AF class cars must have
minimum trunk space 20″ by 12″ by 6″.

145
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,165
Your trunk doesn't close,

146
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,371
- ergo car fails standard.
- Wait, wait. What?

147
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:42,908
Ergo car is disqualified from
said Class A.

148
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:44,133
No, no, no.

149
00:11:44,134 --> 00:11:45,571
- Can I ask you a question?
- All right.

150
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:46,830
When you were a little boy.

151
00:11:47,349 --> 00:11:49,941
Did you think, when I grow up

152
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,712
I wanna go to the fabled
Willow Springs Raceway

153
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,472
and I wanna enforce
Paragraph 15.4 Section 2B

154
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:58,122
of the SCCA regulations
on luggage capacity.

155
00:11:58,123 --> 00:11:59,734
All right, that's it.

156
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,345
I'm ruling you and your team
disqualified from this race.

157
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:07,122
If it isn't Lance Reventlow.

158
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:08,250
Shelby.

159
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,075
How you're doing Lance?

160
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:10,048
- Pops.
- Hey Lance.

161
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:11,504
Allow me to introduce
Dieter Voss.

162
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:13,006
Runs Brumos Porsche
out of Jacksonville Florida.

163
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:14,591
I know all about Mr. Voss,

164
00:12:14,592 --> 00:12:16,752
you're having a hell of a
season with that Abarth, sir.

165
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:19,631
- Seeing results for your Cobra too.
- Thank you.

166
00:12:19,632 --> 00:12:22,623
- Your guy Miles is impressive.
- You're following Miles?

167
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:27,207
He was a USAC road racing champ in '61.
He won the Pikes Peak Hill Climb.

168
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,824
He was SCCA C-class champion,
3 years in a row

169
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:32,221
in this piece of shit
MG he built himself.

170
00:12:32,222 --> 00:12:33,956
We heard he's difficult.

171
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:34,943
What, Ken?

172
00:12:34,944 --> 00:12:36,394
No, no. Ken is a puppy dog.

173
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:38,764
Lance, tell the man.
You raced against Ken.

174
00:12:38,765 --> 00:12:41,087
I've driven more behind him
than against him.

175
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:46,067
Brumos is looking for a driver
for our number two car at Sebring.

176
00:12:46,068 --> 00:12:47,292
Is that right?

177
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:49,480
You think your guy Miles
could make the grade?

178
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:50,959
Oh, well...

179
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:55,552
Jim, is it impotently
bloody carry on on your trunk?

180
00:12:56,472 --> 00:12:58,271
Gentlemen, excuse me a moment.

181
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:01,899
To be honest, Ken was born for Sebring.

182
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:08,163
Nothing in there about my trunk
and your lovely little portmanteau.

183
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:11,226
You're holding a '62 edition of the SCCA.

184
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:16,742
You can stick this bloody sticker
where the sun never shines.

185
00:13:16,743 --> 00:13:19,145
Hey. Hey, Bill.
What seems to be the problem?

186
00:13:19,146 --> 00:13:21,146
The problem is
that Bill here is an arsehole.

187
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:23,762
- No, he doesn't mean that.
- Yes, he does.

188
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:27,574
He really does think
that Bill is an arsehole.

189
00:13:27,575 --> 00:13:29,044
I'm just doing my job here.

190
00:13:29,182 --> 00:13:31,916
Bill, in my experience, there is...
Listen to me.

191
00:13:31,993 --> 00:13:34,117
Something like this, there's always
the middle ground, all right?

192
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:35,917
- Ken's out of line, all right?
- And I'm just doing my job.

193
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:36,789
I understand you are.

194
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,153
You know how it gets on a race day.
You know that, all right?

195
00:13:39,154 --> 00:13:41,259
But you're not gonna DQ us
over the trunk.

196
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,491
Happy, Bill?

197
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:06,932
I'll talk to him.
You just go and have a great day.

198
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,137
Shit.

199
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:13,616
Bulldog.

200
00:14:15,194 --> 00:14:16,946
Do you know who that was
I was just talking to?

201
00:14:16,947 --> 00:14:18,573
- Bill.
- Before that.

202
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:19,629
No.

203
00:14:19,764 --> 00:14:22,399
- It was Dieter Voss.
- Who's that?

204
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:25,289
He runs Porsche, Ken.

205
00:14:25,434 --> 00:14:27,888
It's a little German car company,
maybe you heard of it.

206
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:31,759
He wanted you to drive at Sebring,
but he heard you were difficult.

207
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:39,807
I thought we felt
the same way about

208
00:14:40,635 --> 00:14:42,460
Germans.

209
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:49,141
Do you like losing, Ken?

210
00:14:50,793 --> 00:14:53,206
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

211
00:14:53,962 --> 00:14:55,502
I don't lose.

212
00:14:55,935 --> 00:14:59,130
Without sponsors, you get no car, Ken.

213
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,839
Last I checked,
the professionals all have a car.

214
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,855
You cannot win the SCCA without one.
If you are not winning you are losing.

215
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:09,351
Don't make me lump this
at your head.

216
00:15:09,352 --> 00:15:12,164
Did you bring your son all the way out here
to watch you get disqualified,

217
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:14,165
or just act like a jackass?

218
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,425
That answers that.

219
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:43,668
Peter.

220
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:54,673
May I help you, gentlemen?

221
00:15:54,957 --> 00:15:56,914
Yes, is Ken Miles here?

222
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:58,071
No.

223
00:15:58,072 --> 00:16:00,566
- We need to speak to Mr. Miles.
- I'm his wife.

224
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:03,640
<i>Welcome to the 1963 World's Greatest.</i>

225
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:07,290
<i>112 cars will be competing
at this 40 lap race.</i>

226
00:16:08,371 --> 00:16:11,535
Hey, Ken.
What happened to your shield?

227
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:14,469
New design.

228
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,142
<i>It looks like we are about to begin.</i>

229
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:21,410
<i>The cars are completing the roll out lap.
The green flag is out.</i>

230
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,535
<i>And they're approaching the starting lap.</i>

231
00:16:24,536 --> 00:16:26,254
Here we go.

232
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:30,436
Bloody hell!

233
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:37,806
Learn to drive, you pillock!

234
00:16:43,408 --> 00:16:45,528
So, Shelby, you miss it?

235
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:48,939
Hey, Sam.

236
00:16:49,681 --> 00:16:54,714
Guy wins the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
Suddenly retires. Starts selling cars.

237
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,633
It just doesn't make sense.

238
00:16:57,634 --> 00:17:00,429
Well, unless the rumors are true,
of course.

239
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,805
What rumors would those be, Sam?

240
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:06,367
That Carroll Shelby quit driving
'cause he lost his nerve.

241
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:14,675
I'll give it up and I'll break you
on the next turn, Bob.

242
00:17:26,823 --> 00:17:28,464
Nice try, Bob

243
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:48,949
<i>Nice move from Ken Miles.
22 laps remaining.</i>

244
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:16,697
<i>It's been an incredible day
here in Willow Springs.</i>

245
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:18,857
<i>We've seen some exciting riding.</i>

246
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:22,342
<i>With only 1 lap remaining
in this 40 lap race.</i>

247
00:18:22,343 --> 00:18:24,376
<i>We are coming to the final scratch.</i>

248
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:28,341
<i>Dan Gurney has been leading
the pack for the most of the...</i>

249
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:31,952
<i>Red Faris is off the track.</i>

250
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:36,339
<i>That leaves Dan Gurney for the lead,
followed by journeyman Ken Miles.</i>

251
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:40,268
Now for you, Dan.

252
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,477
<i>And they're coming
around the last turn.</i>

253
00:18:47,478 --> 00:18:51,132
<i>Gurney is still in the lead
with Ken Miles out of dispute.</i>

254
00:18:58,332 --> 00:18:59,801
<i>Miles is looking for an opening.</i>

255
00:18:59,802 --> 00:19:01,020
Not yet.

256
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:03,029
Come on!

257
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:05,912
<i>Can Gurney hold him off?
The final streak.</i>

258
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:07,217
Not yet.

259
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:11,295
<i>Gurney is blocking him out.</i>

260
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:12,613
Now.

261
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:19,360
Nice move, Ken.

262
00:19:23,577 --> 00:19:24,698
<i>They're wheel to wheel.</i>

263
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:26,303
Come on!

264
00:19:35,856 --> 00:19:40,250
<i>An incredible finish for Ken Miles.
Didn't see that one coming.</i>

265
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:45,085
He's difficult, but good.

266
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:49,710
That goes for a nice coup of tea.

267
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,962
I've got the kettle on.

268
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:53,585
Hop in.

269
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:11,556
Pops, frame this.

270
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,586
Hey.

271
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,528
We did it!

272
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:31,256
What's wrong?

273
00:20:32,777 --> 00:20:36,587
The IRS came.
They've padlocked the garage.

274
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:43,863
All right, Petey.

275
00:20:56,357 --> 00:20:58,278
Couple of years ago

276
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:01,003
you said we'd a nest-egg.

277
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,460
Correct.

278
00:21:03,882 --> 00:21:06,352
- A couple of years ago.
- Correct.

279
00:21:11,532 --> 00:21:13,986
So, just to be clear,
we are buggered.

280
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:15,879
Absolutely.

281
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,390
As in totally?

282
00:21:24,738 --> 00:21:29,697
As in not a bean
or a pot in which to piss.

283
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:35,207
Spares. Stock. All gone.
Tools. My tools are locked up in there.

284
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,658
I'll figure something out.

285
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:44,043
In 1945 our soldiers came home.

286
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,132
What was the first thing
that they did?

287
00:21:48,513 --> 00:21:50,360
They had sex.

288
00:21:51,594 --> 00:21:54,985
17 years later, those babies,
they've grown.

289
00:21:54,986 --> 00:21:58,377
They've got jobs. They've got licenses.

290
00:21:58,498 --> 00:22:00,154
But they do not wanna drive

291
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:03,740
the same dull 50's cars
their parents drove.

292
00:22:04,441 --> 00:22:09,490
You see, kids today, they want glamor.
They wanna sex appeal.

293
00:22:09,498 --> 00:22:11,139
They wanna go fast.

294
00:22:11,618 --> 00:22:12,805
Gentlemen.

295
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:16,982
It's time for the Ford Motor Company
to go racing.

296
00:22:18,073 --> 00:22:20,559
We're already in racing, Iacocca.

297
00:22:20,962 --> 00:22:24,293
NASCAR? It's regional, sir.

298
00:22:25,091 --> 00:22:26,725
If you go to the movies.

299
00:22:26,758 --> 00:22:30,576
You open up a magazine, you don't see
good ol' boys in Winston-Salem.

300
00:22:30,577 --> 00:22:31,916
You see

301
00:22:32,843 --> 00:22:34,809
Sophia Loren,

302
00:22:35,469 --> 00:22:37,500
Monica Vitti.

303
00:22:39,886 --> 00:22:43,204
James Bond does not drive a Ford, sir.

304
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:46,217
That's because he's a degenerate.

305
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:50,806
See?

306
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:53,092
God, I'd like to be a degenerate.

307
00:22:53,826 --> 00:22:54,963
Just give me one second, please.

308
00:22:54,964 --> 00:22:56,661
Is this part of it?

309
00:22:56,764 --> 00:22:59,673
- Is this going anywhere, Iacocca?
- Sorry, sir.

310
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:02,050
- All right. All right. That's enough.
- Sir, if you just bear waiting...

311
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:04,014
Turn it off! Lights!

312
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:13,320
Lee, in the last 3 years
you and your marketing team

313
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:18,432
have presided over
the worst sale slump in US history.

314
00:23:20,175 --> 00:23:23,589
Why exactly should Mr. Ford listen to you?

315
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:28,421
Because we've been thinking wrong.

316
00:23:31,324 --> 00:23:32,784
Ferrari.

317
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:36,677
They won 4 out of the last 5 Le Mans.

318
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,673
We need to think like Ferrari.

319
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:44,512
Ferrari makes fewer cars in a year
than we make in a day.

320
00:23:45,235 --> 00:23:50,313
We spend more on toilet paper
than they do on their entire output.

321
00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:52,762
You want us to think like them?

322
00:23:52,763 --> 00:23:54,927
Enzo Ferrari will go down in history

323
00:23:54,928 --> 00:23:57,294
as the greatest car
manufacturer of all time.

324
00:23:58,689 --> 00:23:59,939
Why?

325
00:24:00,631 --> 00:24:04,418
Is it because he built the most cars?

326
00:24:05,798 --> 00:24:06,798
No.

327
00:24:07,494 --> 00:24:10,249
It's because of what his cars mean.

328
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,372
Victory.

329
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:15,192
Ferrari wins at Le Mans.
People they...

330
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:18,063
They want some of that victory.

331
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:23,356
What if the Ford badge meant victory?

332
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:27,331
And meant it where it counts with the
first group of 17-year-olds in history.

333
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,501
- with money in their pockets.
- This would take years.

334
00:24:30,627 --> 00:24:36,382
Decades to test and develop a race team
capable of taking on Ferrari.

335
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,268
Ferrari's bankrupt.

336
00:24:41,095 --> 00:24:45,124
Enzo spent every lire he's got chasing
perfection, and you know something?

337
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,794
He got there.

338
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,786
But now he's broke.

339
00:25:13,205 --> 00:25:15,717
You don't have to give up racing
to get a bloody day job, Ken.

340
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:16,956
I think I do.

341
00:25:16,957 --> 00:25:21,215
I've had my fun, it's time
to put food on the table and grow up.

342
00:25:21,331 --> 00:25:23,817
The garage didn't pay the pills.
Now it's locked up.

343
00:25:23,903 --> 00:25:26,593
Racing doesn't pay them either
and I keep winning.

344
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:28,314
Yeah, because you're good.

345
00:25:28,315 --> 00:25:30,866
I can't play the game.

346
00:25:31,054 --> 00:25:33,428
I'm not what they call "the people person".

347
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:34,415
You don't say.

348
00:25:34,416 --> 00:25:37,049
And I'm 45 years old.
Do you really think I'm gonna change?

349
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:41,132
I'm never gonna get the good rides.
I started too late.

350
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:43,354
Because you fought in a bloody war!

351
00:25:44,727 --> 00:25:48,368
If you stop
you'd be bloody insufferable.

352
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:52,484
It was a quick all around the region.
It's over.

353
00:25:53,015 --> 00:25:54,706
Let's look on the bright side.

354
00:25:54,818 --> 00:25:58,901
Now I can get fat and old,
trim the roses and eat pork pies.

355
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:24,036
Scuzi, please.
No photos, prego.

356
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,239
Relax.

357
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,411
You gotta understand.

358
00:26:26,442 --> 00:26:29,320
This is like the Mafia showing up
to buy the Statue of Liberty.

359
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,704
Kind of the opposite, actually.

360
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:34,047
if the Press gets wind of this,
the shit will hit the Fangio.

361
00:26:34,517 --> 00:26:38,354
- Lee Iacocca, Ford Motor.
- Franco Gozzi, Ferrari.

362
00:26:38,968 --> 00:26:41,713
Sonno queste...
Your journalist?

363
00:26:41,714 --> 00:26:46,834
No, no, Mr. Iacocca.
It's our cameras, just for history.

364
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,724
Four liters Colombo engine.

365
00:26:53,342 --> 00:26:57,313
One man assembles
the entire engine by himself.

366
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:01,806
Another man assembles the transmission.

367
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,831
Everything hand-built.

368
00:27:06,302 --> 00:27:08,045
Benissimo.

369
00:27:20,691 --> 00:27:22,424
Racing department.

370
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,461
Lee, that's him.

371
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:35,284
This merger between our companies
will form two entities.

372
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,048
Ford-Ferarri: 90% owned by Ford
who controls all production.

373
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:53,453
Secondly, Ferarri-Ford, the race team.
90% owned by Ferrari.

374
00:27:58,373 --> 00:28:02,776
In order to secure this
Ford will pay the sum...

375
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,690
10 million dollars.

376
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,196
Excuse me.

377
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:39,033
He will need some time to read this.

378
00:28:39,205 --> 00:28:40,716
Please.

379
00:28:43,604 --> 00:28:45,179
Understood.

380
00:29:37,782 --> 00:29:39,696
Well done, thank you.

381
00:29:56,017 --> 00:29:59,354
Only one small question.
It concerns my race program.

382
00:30:08,469 --> 00:30:13,470
If I wish to race Le Mans
and you do not wish for me to race Le Mans,

383
00:30:13,471 --> 00:30:15,764
Do we or do we not go?

384
00:30:23,552 --> 00:30:27,137
In that highly unlikely scenario.

385
00:30:28,851 --> 00:30:33,529
If we just can't agree then, yes.
I mean, no.

386
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:36,140
You are correct.

387
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:38,781
You do not go.

388
00:30:55,891 --> 00:30:58,822
My integrity as a constructor,
as a man, as an Italian

389
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,307
is deeply insulted by your proposal.

390
00:31:02,202 --> 00:31:04,116
Go back to Michigan.

391
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:10,684
Back to your big ugly factory.

392
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,954
Back to your big ugly factory
making its ugly little cars.

393
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,855
Tell your pig-headed boss that all his

394
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,816
smug executives are
worthless sons of whores.

395
00:31:32,736 --> 00:31:36,004
Tell him he's not Henry Ford.

396
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:40,525
He is Henry Ford II.

397
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:09,311
He played us.

398
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,641
Old man Enzo had no intention
of selling to us.

399
00:32:13,017 --> 00:32:16,116
He used us to up his price.

400
00:32:16,466 --> 00:32:19,426
Embarrass our company,
insult your leadership.

401
00:32:19,657 --> 00:32:22,313
It was a bad idea from the start.

402
00:32:30,368 --> 00:32:33,179
What exactly did he say?

403
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:46,242
He said Ford makes ugly little cars,
and we make 'em in ugly factory.

404
00:32:47,984 --> 00:32:51,458
He said our executives are sons of whores.

405
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:56,826
About me.

406
00:32:58,325 --> 00:33:00,506
He called you fatster.

407
00:33:02,703 --> 00:33:04,243
Pig-headed.

408
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:06,850
Go on.

409
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:10,369
He said you're not Henry Ford.

410
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:13,509
You're Henry Ford II.

411
00:33:34,897 --> 00:33:38,496
I want the best engineers.

412
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:42,069
The best drivers.

413
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:46,367
I don't care what it costs.

414
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:51,605
We're gonna build a race car.

415
00:33:57,615 --> 00:34:00,290
And we gonna bury
that goddamn greasy wop

416
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:04,750
a 100 feet deep
under the finish line at Le Mans.

417
00:34:05,414 --> 00:34:08,448
And I will be there to watch it.

418
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,123
Here they come.
Go! Go! Go!

419
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:17,103
- Asshole!
- You're really pathetic!

420
00:34:17,104 --> 00:34:18,300
I'm so sorry, girls.

421
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:20,917
Charlie, quit throwing
crackers at the girls

422
00:34:20,918 --> 00:34:22,918
all damn day, goddammit.

423
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:26,122
- Do I gotta deal with this?
- It's already taken care of.

424
00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:28,296
Sorry about that.

425
00:34:28,297 --> 00:34:31,303
So, yeah. 289 cubic inch V8.

426
00:34:31,434 --> 00:34:32,204
All right.

427
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:34,449
Extensive rework of AC Ace's front end

428
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:36,582
and a stronger rear diff
to handle the torque.

429
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:38,495
How does she handle the quarter mile?

430
00:34:39,134 --> 00:34:41,378
I'm not saying
you should go drag racing.

431
00:34:41,462 --> 00:34:43,612
But quarter mile is 13.6.

432
00:34:43,965 --> 00:34:45,650
- Is that good?
- That's real good.

433
00:34:45,742 --> 00:34:48,413
He sold that same car
3 times this week.

434
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,733
- You take cash? Is cash okay?
- Cash is okay.

435
00:34:50,734 --> 00:34:53,990
Yeah, mister, you just bought yourself
one hell of a sport car.

436
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:58,124
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna... Phil.

437
00:34:58,325 --> 00:35:01,061
I'm gonna pass you off to my colleague
here, he gonna take care of you.

438
00:35:01,062 --> 00:35:02,865
Phil, Wyatt.

439
00:35:02,866 --> 00:35:04,885
I'll steal him for one second.

440
00:35:05,559 --> 00:35:06,752
You take the payment.

441
00:35:06,753 --> 00:35:09,989
Whatever you do, do not let him take
that car, that's Jeff Blitzer's car.

442
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,998
And Frank Collins's.
And Steve McQueen's.

443
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:14,375
Shit, I forgot about McQueen.

444
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:20,414
Morning, can I help?

445
00:35:21,516 --> 00:35:23,244
Carroll Shelby.

446
00:35:23,924 --> 00:35:25,283
Maybe.

447
00:35:26,296 --> 00:35:28,130
Lee Iacocca, Ford Motor.

448
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,722
What's with the wrench?

449
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:36,229
That? Long story.

450
00:35:36,914 --> 00:35:39,965
We are just goin'
from strength to strength here, Lee.

451
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:43,187
Terrific sales.
We're killing it on the track.

452
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,668
Now I know we owe Ford
for the last batch of engines...

453
00:35:45,669 --> 00:35:48,772
Mr. Shelby, I can assure you
I'm not here for the money

454
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:50,358
that you might owe
Ford for spare parts.

455
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:53,239
You're not?

456
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:55,595
No, I'm not.

457
00:35:56,377 --> 00:35:57,421
Okay.

458
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:00,416
I'm here on behalf of Mr. Ford,
Henry Ford II.

459
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:03,546
Suppose, hypothetically,

460
00:36:03,987 --> 00:36:07,712
he wanted his company
to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

461
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:11,386
You're one of the only Americans
that's ever done it.

462
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:15,187
I'm wondering, what's it take?

463
00:36:18,537 --> 00:36:20,083
Hypothetically?

464
00:36:20,854 --> 00:36:22,533
Hypothetically.

465
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:25,877
It take something money can't buy.

466
00:36:26,622 --> 00:36:28,590
Money can buy speed.

467
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:31,696
It isn't about speed, Lee.

468
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:35,593
It's not just like those other
tracks where all you do is

469
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:37,672
turn to the left for 4 hours.

470
00:36:39,978 --> 00:36:41,492
To win that race, you need a car

471
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:43,644
that's light enough to do
200 on the straight areas,

472
00:36:43,645 --> 00:36:47,396
but strong enough to keep that up
for 3000 miles without a break.

473
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:51,455
Not just the best car y’all ever made,

474
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:54,890
but better than anything that Enzo Ferrari
shows up with that year.

475
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:58,772
And that just gets you to the green flag,
that's where your problems really start.

476
00:37:00,546 --> 00:37:04,029
- Is everything okay?
- Go away.

477
00:37:11,324 --> 00:37:13,371
So, you're saying it's challenging.

478
00:37:15,913 --> 00:37:18,121
Look, it's not even a track, Lee.

479
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:21,469
Le Mans's 8.5 miles of country road

480
00:37:22,292 --> 00:37:25,324
that's narrow, ungraded. It's rough.

481
00:37:25,622 --> 00:37:28,652
There's no camber on the turns. No rails.

482
00:37:31,325 --> 00:37:33,793
You gotta do that for 24 hours.

483
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,734
24 hours, Lee.

484
00:37:38,379 --> 00:37:40,079
That means night.

485
00:37:40,308 --> 00:37:43,363
Half of that race is in the dark,
you can't see shit.

486
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:47,053
Cars coming up on you out of nowhere.

487
00:37:48,344 --> 00:37:51,874
Drivers stumblin' around the track
pourin' blood.

488
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:56,438
Maybe one of them is your friend.
Maybe he's on fire.

489
00:37:58,244 --> 00:38:00,495
You're exhausted. You're hungry.

490
00:38:00,683 --> 00:38:03,557
Can't remember your name.
What country you're in.

491
00:38:04,447 --> 00:38:08,024
And all of a sudden you realize
you're doing 198 on the straight.

492
00:38:11,571 --> 00:38:13,460
And if anything goes wrong.

493
00:38:14,315 --> 00:38:17,286
You blow a gasket, 5 cent washer.

494
00:38:17,514 --> 00:38:19,769
That's it. Whole thing's over.

495
00:38:20,145 --> 00:38:22,263
Ferrari wins again.

496
00:38:22,595 --> 00:38:23,927
Just like it won last year.

497
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:26,204
The year before that,
and the year before that.

498
00:38:30,552 --> 00:38:34,030
Yeah, it's challenging.

499
00:38:35,049 --> 00:38:38,484
You don't think that
Ford Motor Company can build

500
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:40,476
the greatest race car
the world's ever seen?

501
00:38:40,477 --> 00:38:44,984
You think that we are
incapable of winning event like that?

502
00:38:45,258 --> 00:38:47,926
Even if we had a brilliant partner?

503
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:53,762
Even if we wrote a blank check?

504
00:39:00,386 --> 00:39:04,143
What I'm saying is
you can't buy a win, Lee,

505
00:39:06,486 --> 00:39:11,166
but maybe you could buy the guy
who gets you a shot.

506
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:31,564
The new transmission.
Axles, shocks all around.

507
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,397
Ditch the body and the tires

508
00:39:33,398 --> 00:39:35,553
and you have yourself a contender.

509
00:39:36,326 --> 00:39:38,153
Anything on this beauty
that does work?

510
00:39:38,314 --> 00:39:40,879
The mirrors are outstanding.

511
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,694
I saw that walking up.

512
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:47,800
So, what?
You're just passing or evening stroll?

513
00:39:48,078 --> 00:39:50,643
Actually, bulldog,
I have a proposition for you.

514
00:39:50,803 --> 00:39:55,212
You gonna build a car
to beat old man Ferrari?

515
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:59,356
with Ford. With a Ford?

516
00:39:59,357 --> 00:40:00,522
Correct.

517
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:02,684
And how long did you tell them
that you needed?

518
00:40:02,685 --> 00:40:04,725
Two, three hundred years?

519
00:40:04,878 --> 00:40:06,524
90 days.

520
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:13,295
All right, so, let's just look
at this for a moment.

521
00:40:13,963 --> 00:40:15,498
And for argument's sake,

522
00:40:15,522 --> 00:40:17,964
let's just forget about
the whole 90 day thing.

523
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:21,954
Let's just pretend you got all the money
in the world and all the time in the world.

524
00:40:21,955 --> 00:40:23,871
I like the sound of that.

525
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:28,152
You think that Ford
are gonna let you build

526
00:40:28,854 --> 00:40:33,866
the car that you want
the way you want it?

527
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:36,781
The Ford Motor Company?

528
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:39,792
Those guys?

529
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:44,809
Have you ever been to Detroit?
They have floors and floors of lawyers,

530
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,811
and millions of marketing guys,
and they all gonna wanna meet you,

531
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,631
all of them gonna wanna get their photo
taken with the great Carroll Shelby,

532
00:40:50,632 --> 00:40:53,630
and they gonna kiss your arse, and then
they gonna go back to their lovely offices,

533
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:56,029
and they would work on
new ways to screw you.

534
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:58,783
Why? Because they can't help it.

535
00:40:58,784 --> 00:41:00,668
Because they just wanna
please their boss,

536
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:04,363
who wants to please his boss,
who wants to please his boss.

537
00:41:04,364 --> 00:41:08,239
And they hate themselves for
it, but deep down,

538
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,745
who they hate even
more, the guys like you,

539
00:41:11,746 --> 00:41:14,959
because you're not like them,
because you don't think like them,

540
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,960
because you're different.

541
00:41:18,205 --> 00:41:20,522
It's coming straight from the Deuce.

542
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:24,008
He's serious.

543
00:41:24,009 --> 00:41:26,311
They gonna put real money behind it.

544
00:41:28,762 --> 00:41:30,568
I bet they are.

545
00:41:31,123 --> 00:41:35,367
You know why?
Because someone, and I'm not saying who.

546
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:41,320
Someone has told them
that this is actually possible.

547
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:45,427
Look, this Sunday at Cloverfield,
they're launching a new Mustang.

548
00:41:45,428 --> 00:41:47,396
I'm gonna announce the race program.

549
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:50,060
Just come on by.

550
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:54,659
Come take a look.
Listen to my speech.

551
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:58,286
I'm making a speech.
Bring Peter, he'll love it.

552
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:01,950
I'll watch you.

553
00:42:04,328 --> 00:42:05,626
See you Sunday.

554
00:42:11,438 --> 00:42:14,091
Dad, look at that.

555
00:42:18,046 --> 00:42:20,754
Ford Mustang. What do you think?

556
00:42:23,982 --> 00:42:26,161
I think it's a secretary's car.

557
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,357
I like it.

558
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,820
Excuse me. Excuse me.

559
00:42:35,282 --> 00:42:37,302
Would you mind not to do that?

560
00:42:38,731 --> 00:42:40,223
Sorry.

561
00:42:43,773 --> 00:42:47,279
- Is this your son?
- Yes, it is.

562
00:42:47,447 --> 00:42:50,755
Would you ask him
to keep his hands off the paintwork?

563
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,315
No, no, Petey, you're okay.
Who are you?

564
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:57,176
Leo Beebe, Senior Executive Vice President,
Ford Motor Company.

565
00:42:57,177 --> 00:43:00,173
I am responsible
for the launch of the Mustang.

566
00:43:00,433 --> 00:43:02,857
At least now we know who's responsible.

567
00:43:02,858 --> 00:43:04,694
- Don't get me wrong, Lenny.
- Leo.

568
00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:09,157
It looks fantastic,
but inside it's a lump of lard

569
00:43:09,158 --> 00:43:10,595
dressed up to fool the public.

570
00:43:10,596 --> 00:43:15,582
My advice is: lose the Inline 6
and that idiotic 3 speeds,

571
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:19,222
shorten wheelbase.
Somehow lose half a ton.

572
00:43:19,316 --> 00:43:21,363
- And lower the price.
- Dad.

573
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:25,526
But even then
I'd still choose the Chevy Chevelle.

574
00:43:25,765 --> 00:43:28,361
That's a fucking terrible car.

575
00:43:29,624 --> 00:43:31,515
How are we doing up there, Steve?

576
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:33,889
There's Cloverfield, Mr. Shelby.

577
00:43:34,507 --> 00:43:35,689
Oh, yeah.

578
00:43:36,336 --> 00:43:38,804
You mind if I take a shot
at the landing?

579
00:43:39,461 --> 00:43:42,979
Come on, I mean it. I flew a B-29s
outta San Antonio back in '44.

580
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,601
- Are you kidding me?
- I did.

581
00:43:45,086 --> 00:43:45,959
Okay.

582
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,535
Carroll, what are you doing?

583
00:43:47,536 --> 00:43:48,813
- Does he know how to fly?
- Carroll.

584
00:43:48,814 --> 00:43:51,170
I had an instructor
who'd tell me

585
00:43:51,492 --> 00:43:54,000
Looking down I would say
it's probably a good time to buckle up.

586
00:43:54,001 --> 00:43:56,251
Do everybody a favor
and stay on the ground.

587
00:43:56,712 --> 00:43:58,526
That's a true story.

588
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:05,141
This is the car
you never expected for Detroit.

589
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,470
All right. Let's go.

590
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:13,992
Not staying, Ken?

591
00:44:14,581 --> 00:44:16,781
It's a bloody pig in a poke, isn't it.

592
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,325
There they come now.

593
00:44:22,847 --> 00:44:25,167
Wait, are they crashing?

594
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:26,932
Who is the pilot?

595
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,199
My guess, Peter...

596
00:44:32,267 --> 00:44:33,877
Someone we know.

597
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:36,800
Everything all right up there?

598
00:44:37,022 --> 00:44:38,074
No!

599
00:44:38,751 --> 00:44:39,882
Hang on.

600
00:44:39,883 --> 00:44:42,233
Shit!

601
00:44:45,931 --> 00:44:48,333
I'll tell you what,
that's like riding a bike.

602
00:44:54,552 --> 00:44:57,678
Talking about making an entrance.
Good grief.

603
00:44:58,148 --> 00:44:59,856
- Shelby!
- Over here!

604
00:45:01,662 --> 00:45:03,187
Hey out there.

605
00:45:04,257 --> 00:45:05,617
Can we have an autograph, sir?

606
00:45:05,618 --> 00:45:06,995
Shelby, this is Roy Lunn.

607
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:09,742
Ol' Roy here is developing
the prototype over in England.

608
00:45:09,895 --> 00:45:11,799
Hell, I know Roy.
Good to see you, Roy.

609
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,023
Welcome to madhouse, Shelby.

610
00:45:13,024 --> 00:45:15,615
Ford willed up the entire
executive committee for this one.

611
00:45:15,974 --> 00:45:17,712
Hold that thought.

612
00:45:18,703 --> 00:45:20,703
Hello, Mr. Lindbergh.

613
00:45:20,864 --> 00:45:22,836
Did you like that?
Hey, Peter, how are you doing?

614
00:45:22,837 --> 00:45:24,294
- Mr. Shelby.
- Good to see you.

615
00:45:24,295 --> 00:45:26,874
Are you building a car
so you can beat Ferrari?

616
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:30,425
Well, we're gonna go to Le Mans,
that's for sure.

617
00:45:30,426 --> 00:45:32,514
And if get across that finish line first
we gonna win.

618
00:45:32,515 --> 00:45:36,429
Carroll, allow me to introduce Leo Beebe,
Senior Vice President Ford Motor.

619
00:45:36,774 --> 00:45:37,497
Oh, sure, yeah.

620
00:45:37,498 --> 00:45:38,738
- Please Mr. Beebe.
- Thank you for coming.

621
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:40,810
Say hello to Ken Miles
and his son Peter.

622
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,621
- We...
- Right.

623
00:45:42,622 --> 00:45:44,013
We met.

624
00:45:46,186 --> 00:45:47,673
Didn't we?

625
00:45:49,577 --> 00:45:52,235
I'll take Petey for some pop.

626
00:45:52,527 --> 00:45:54,332
Good luck with these guys, Shel.

627
00:45:54,443 --> 00:45:56,421
- Bye, Mr. Shelby.
- See you, Pete.

628
00:45:56,746 --> 00:45:58,493
Don't worry, he's gonna stay.

629
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:01,932
You two had a chance
to talk on the plane?

630
00:46:03,163 --> 00:46:07,450
Yeah, Carroll, why don't we just...
Step this way for a second...

631
00:46:14,376 --> 00:46:16,410
Look, it's pro forma.
It's window dressing.

632
00:46:16,411 --> 00:46:20,141
But there's gotta be a sense
of getting the tape between you and....

633
00:46:21,103 --> 00:46:23,241
- No, I don't.
- The group.

634
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:24,373
The group?

635
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:28,472
Senior creatives, Carroll.
Just to make sure everybody's comfortable.

636
00:46:28,584 --> 00:46:29,906
I'm confused, Lee.

637
00:46:29,907 --> 00:46:32,991
'Cause up until this moment
right now I was comfortable.

638
00:46:33,744 --> 00:46:35,676
Why don't you take a look
out there, Carroll?

639
00:46:36,021 --> 00:46:37,394
What do you see?

640
00:46:37,821 --> 00:46:40,482
Do you know what I see?
I see a machine.

641
00:46:40,555 --> 00:46:43,927
I see ten thousand moving parts
moving, hopefully, in harmony.

642
00:46:43,928 --> 00:46:46,959
And it's my job to make it so.
It's my job to guide you through it.

643
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,619
I'm here to help you, Carroll.
But you gotta trust me.

644
00:46:51,764 --> 00:46:53,660
- Excuse me, Lee.
- Carroll.

645
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:56,105
Do not step on that stage
if you don't trust me.

646
00:46:56,189 --> 00:46:58,686
Please, welcome Mr. Carroll Shelby.

647
00:46:58,687 --> 00:47:00,287
Gotta go.

648
00:47:06,943 --> 00:47:09,333
- What did he say?
- He gets the drill.

649
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:13,854
Thank you.

650
00:47:14,354 --> 00:47:16,266
If my Daddy was here today

651
00:47:16,606 --> 00:47:21,153
he'd tell me to sit on down
and leave the yackin' to the college boys.

652
00:47:21,502 --> 00:47:24,021
Like my cars, I'll make this fast.

653
00:47:26,165 --> 00:47:28,841
When I was 10 years old,
my Pops said, son

654
00:47:29,422 --> 00:47:33,383
it's a truly lucky man who knows
what he wants to do in this world.

655
00:47:33,578 --> 00:47:36,146
'Cause that man will never work
a day in his life.

656
00:47:36,892 --> 00:47:38,881
But there are a few, a precious few,

657
00:47:38,882 --> 00:47:41,564
and hell I don't know
if they're lucky or not,

658
00:47:42,394 --> 00:47:45,640
but there are a few people
who find something they have to do.

659
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,573
Something obsesses them.

660
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,450
Something if they can't do it,

661
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:53,451
it's gonna drive them
clean outta their mind.

662
00:47:54,463 --> 00:47:56,151
I'm that guy.

663
00:47:56,842 --> 00:47:59,807
And I know one other man
feels exactly the same.

664
00:48:01,095 --> 00:48:02,611
His name...

665
00:48:04,562 --> 00:48:07,088
His name is Mr. Henry Ford.

666
00:48:11,143 --> 00:48:15,516
And together we gonna build
the fastest automobile in the world.

667
00:48:18,338 --> 00:48:21,920
And we gonna make history too at Le Mans.

668
00:48:23,941 --> 00:48:25,683
Let's go.

669
00:48:26,495 --> 00:48:31,041
My name is Carroll Shelby.
I build race cars.

670
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:56,271
No, Whatever it is, no.

671
00:48:57,882 --> 00:48:59,218
No.

672
00:49:00,005 --> 00:49:01,542
30 minutes.

673
00:49:03,429 --> 00:49:05,228
I'm spent, I wanna have a bath.

674
00:49:05,229 --> 00:49:08,713
You gonna wanna see this.
Trust me.

675
00:49:10,259 --> 00:49:12,982
30 minutes.
I'll have you back for meatloaf and gravy.

676
00:49:15,973 --> 00:49:18,412
- 30 minutes.
- Yeah.

677
00:49:36,854 --> 00:49:38,769
Bloody hell.

678
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:46,410
Fresh off the plane from England.

679
00:49:48,604 --> 00:49:52,001
She's still a little
on the rare side of cooked.

680
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:03,327
Come on.

681
00:50:16,123 --> 00:50:17,512
Interesting.

682
00:50:34,194 --> 00:50:35,314
Well?

683
00:50:35,315 --> 00:50:38,036
- It's awful.
- It's worse than awful.

684
00:50:38,037 --> 00:50:41,345
It doesn't track.
The 3rd gear is too high,

685
00:50:42,733 --> 00:50:45,341
torque is not reaching the road.

686
00:50:45,557 --> 00:50:49,247
Steering's loose because
the front end gets light.

687
00:50:49,248 --> 00:50:51,736
At over 140 it thinks it's...

688
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,633
- Airplane.
- Yeah.

689
00:50:54,201 --> 00:50:56,576
It wants to lift off and fly to Hawaii.

690
00:50:59,134 --> 00:51:01,018
Anything else?

691
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:07,270
One second.

692
00:51:37,691 --> 00:51:39,560
You were back late last night.

693
00:51:39,561 --> 00:51:41,140
Yeah.

694
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:45,924
Were you working?

695
00:51:50,129 --> 00:51:52,067
Didn't go anyplace?

696
00:51:52,557 --> 00:51:53,867
What?

697
00:51:55,935 --> 00:51:58,628
I'm asking, did you go
anyplace last night?

698
00:52:00,747 --> 00:52:02,154
Mollie.

699
00:52:02,155 --> 00:52:04,305
It's a simple question.

700
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,001
And I answered, didn't I?

701
00:52:08,107 --> 00:52:09,792
What was the answer?

702
00:52:11,617 --> 00:52:13,425
Is something up, luv?

703
00:52:14,838 --> 00:52:15,889
What are you doing?

704
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:18,150
What are you doing?
You're driving very fast.

705
00:52:18,151 --> 00:52:19,773
Am I? Am I?

706
00:52:19,774 --> 00:52:21,677
Yes, you are!

707
00:52:23,024 --> 00:52:25,245
Bloody hell!
What are you..? What is this?

708
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:27,205
You tell me 'cause I don't know.

709
00:52:27,206 --> 00:52:29,516
What? Slow down!

710
00:52:30,352 --> 00:52:31,929
Mollie!

711
00:52:34,004 --> 00:52:37,656
Please! Slow it down! All right?
You're trying to kill us or something?

712
00:52:37,828 --> 00:52:40,490
- I thought we love this shit.
- What?

713
00:52:41,671 --> 00:52:42,569
Bloody hell!

714
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:45,806
- It's a bit of racing fun, no?
- No, it's not the same!

715
00:52:46,224 --> 00:52:48,173
I think it's thrilling!

716
00:52:48,729 --> 00:52:49,920
All right.

717
00:52:50,398 --> 00:52:52,384
I saw you, all right?

718
00:52:53,032 --> 00:52:55,837
I saw you leaving with Shelby,
and I saw you coming back.

719
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:57,504
Okay. Shit. Okay.
Slow down.

720
00:52:57,505 --> 00:52:59,579
All then all day you got
that stupid look on your face.

721
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:02,312
Mollie, slow down!
You're too close in.

722
00:53:05,066 --> 00:53:07,529
Mollie, pull on the brakes right now!

723
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:09,719
Not until you tell me what's going on!

724
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,189
All right. I went to look at a car.

725
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,949
- With Shelby?
- With Shelby.

726
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,404
- A racing car?
- Sort of.

727
00:53:17,596 --> 00:53:20,068
There's a corner coming,
you better hold on.

728
00:53:21,329 --> 00:53:23,361
Are you gonna lift your foot off
at all through this?

729
00:53:23,362 --> 00:53:25,111
No. 'Cause I like that clean race inline.

730
00:53:25,112 --> 00:53:27,030
Slow down!

731
00:53:30,576 --> 00:53:34,071
Okay. Shel offered me a job.
Ford owns a car

732
00:53:34,171 --> 00:53:36,328
that they wanna put up
against the Ferrari.

733
00:53:36,428 --> 00:53:40,110
- You told me you were done!
- I didn't say yes!

734
00:53:40,437 --> 00:53:42,905
- Slow down!
- You told me you quit!

735
00:53:44,025 --> 00:53:46,364
- I don't understand.
- You fat and old you said!

736
00:53:46,502 --> 00:53:48,533
Fat and old!

737
00:53:52,194 --> 00:53:55,093
- That's what you told me!
- I don't understand.

738
00:53:55,453 --> 00:54:00,371
Are you upset because I said I was done
or because I looked at a race car?

739
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:03,829
Just don't lie to me again!

740
00:54:05,584 --> 00:54:08,403
Don't make it a secret,
what you want or what you feel

741
00:54:08,482 --> 00:54:11,721
just because you think
it's gonna make me happy!

742
00:54:13,344 --> 00:54:15,936
Mol, I don't even know what I feel.

743
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:24,635
If you do this

744
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:29,752
they better be paying you this time.

745
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:34,493
'Cause I can't work any more hours
and look after Peter.

746
00:54:34,494 --> 00:54:38,291
The IRS has the garage.
I'm not losing my home.

747
00:54:38,748 --> 00:54:40,768
It's 200 a day

748
00:54:43,149 --> 00:54:45,035
plus expenses.

749
00:54:47,502 --> 00:54:49,190
Are you shitting me?

750
00:54:49,191 --> 00:54:51,778
But, I haven't decided.

751
00:54:54,244 --> 00:54:56,547
200 dollars a day?

752
00:54:58,663 --> 00:55:00,512
Are you nuts?

753
00:55:23,437 --> 00:55:25,506
This is ridiculous.

754
00:55:27,773 --> 00:55:30,912
Grabbing air. That's the problem.

755
00:55:31,782 --> 00:55:35,470
Over 90 air's getting in, not getting out.

756
00:55:35,471 --> 00:55:37,557
It's the nose.
I can feel it in the wheel.

757
00:55:37,558 --> 00:55:39,964
Mr. Miles, if there's a problem
the computer will find it.

758
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:43,734
Charlie, get some scotch tape
and a ball of wool.

759
00:55:44,681 --> 00:55:45,681
All right.

760
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:50,806
Good, good. Now let's just
get all of this junk out.

761
00:55:51,109 --> 00:55:52,581
All right, Pops?

762
00:55:57,272 --> 00:55:58,608
What are they doing?

763
00:55:58,765 --> 00:56:00,913
Making the car faster.

764
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:10,717
There! Right there!
Airflow's getting stuck.

765
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:19,273
I see it. Yarn blows straight up.
Front's lifting. Damn he's right.

766
00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:33,283
This car wants to go faster. I feel it.

767
00:56:33,405 --> 00:56:35,835
Any lighter we're getting fragile.

768
00:56:35,836 --> 00:56:37,836
We took 70 pounds out
of her in the last week.

769
00:56:37,919 --> 00:56:41,040
She's outputting max horsepower
from this displacement.

770
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:44,923
- So put in a bigger engine.
- Where we gonna put it? On the roof?

771
00:56:46,981 --> 00:56:51,508
Managed to make it 52 pounds lighter
than the NASCAR unit.

772
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:58,468
All new aluminum cylinder heads.

773
00:56:59,263 --> 00:57:02,552
Vibration dampers. Water pump.
Smaller valves.

774
00:57:02,588 --> 00:57:04,689
We call it "The Beast".

775
00:57:04,864 --> 00:57:09,309
I see why, but how is it gonna fit
without the redesigning the engine pit?

776
00:57:09,353 --> 00:57:11,771
It certainly wasn't easy.
Good Morning, gentlemen, Mr. Shelby.

777
00:57:11,772 --> 00:57:16,381
So, you already put that in a GT-40?

778
00:57:17,024 --> 00:57:18,987
I'm afraid we have.

779
00:57:24,457 --> 00:57:26,136
I'll be damned.

780
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:27,623
It's heavy, of course.

781
00:57:27,624 --> 00:57:30,413
Problems with the handling especially
the stopping. I can show you the data.

782
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:31,465
What problems?

783
00:57:31,466 --> 00:57:33,964
Can I borrow that?

784
00:57:34,558 --> 00:57:35,883
Just a second, rhank you.

785
00:57:36,043 --> 00:57:38,074
Ken! Ken!

786
00:57:38,682 --> 00:57:40,751
Perhaps we ought to check with HQ
before you can drive...

787
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:43,242
- What did you say?
- We should ask...

788
00:57:43,698 --> 00:57:45,120
All right.

789
00:57:57,385 --> 00:57:59,826
Mr. Shelby. Welcome to Dearborn.

790
00:57:59,827 --> 00:58:01,003
What are you doing
at a test track?

791
00:58:01,004 --> 00:58:03,270
You're gonna get Castrol
all over that nice suit.

792
00:58:04,012 --> 00:58:07,744
I want to hear your thoughts on a few
planning decisions. Personnel for Le Mans.

793
00:58:07,964 --> 00:58:10,787
It's a hell of a line up.
Ken Miles. Phil Hill.

794
00:58:11,192 --> 00:58:12,913
Chris Amon. Bruce McLaren.

795
00:58:12,914 --> 00:58:15,389
Hill's a lock. Amon. McLaren too.

796
00:58:15,442 --> 00:58:17,210
We're less sure about Miles.

797
00:58:17,211 --> 00:58:21,827
We like Richie Ginter.
Masten Gregory. Bob Bondurant?

798
00:58:22,338 --> 00:58:27,315
You want the best driver for the car,
who understands the machine, that's Ken.

799
00:58:28,753 --> 00:58:30,026
Yes.

800
00:58:30,435 --> 00:58:33,764
More of that, please.
More of that, my girl.

801
00:58:33,765 --> 00:58:37,628
I may not get the finer points of racing
Mr. Shelby, but I do know people.

802
00:58:37,991 --> 00:58:42,260
Miles is... He's a beatnik.
He dresses like one.

803
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:46,798
Ford means reliability.
Ken Miles is not a Ford man.

804
00:58:48,539 --> 00:58:50,675
Get it up! Get it up!

805
00:58:53,916 --> 00:58:56,011
What's the lap record here, Burt?

806
00:58:56,012 --> 00:58:57,392
1.58.

807
00:58:58,332 --> 00:58:59,757
1.50. Dead.

808
00:58:59,758 --> 00:59:03,280
A beatnik? That man landed
a busted tank on the beach at D-Day

809
00:59:03,281 --> 00:59:05,554
and drove it clean
across Europe to Berlin.

810
00:59:06,326 --> 00:59:07,655
A beatnik?

811
00:59:08,146 --> 00:59:11,214
Lee here asked me a while back,
what's the one thing money can't buy.

812
00:59:12,313 --> 00:59:13,518
I'll tell you what it is.

813
00:59:13,818 --> 00:59:16,218
A pure racer behind the wheel of your car.

814
00:59:16,802 --> 00:59:18,527
That's Ken Miles.

815
00:59:20,245 --> 00:59:22,277
Be that as it may,

816
00:59:22,538 --> 00:59:25,002
we think he may be too pure.

817
00:59:32,419 --> 00:59:35,751
Carrol, do not lose sight
of the big picture here.

818
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:38,187
Too pure?

819
00:59:39,104 --> 00:59:40,787
What exactly does that mean?

820
00:59:41,574 --> 00:59:43,663
Means he's all about himself.

821
00:59:44,857 --> 00:59:49,036
ABC puts a microphone under his nose.
Perhaps there's a detail he dislikes.

822
00:59:49,184 --> 00:59:50,427
Millions watching.

823
00:59:50,558 --> 00:59:53,008
Do you trust him not to put out
the wrong message?

824
00:59:53,009 --> 00:59:55,483
He can get it.
Clean cut all American poster boy.

825
00:59:55,484 --> 00:59:57,862
And stick him behind the wheel.
Teach him what to say.

826
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:01,256
Shit, you get Doris Day to drive the car
if all you wanna do is lose.

827
01:00:01,576 --> 01:00:04,577
So, you don't agree with us
on this issue?

828
01:00:06,913 --> 01:00:09,240
I'm saying you're gotta trust me
on this one.

829
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:12,705
Carroll, with marketing concerns,
that's just not possible.

830
01:00:14,339 --> 01:00:18,041
Put a Ford type driver
in a Ford car, Mr. Shelby.

831
01:00:18,267 --> 01:00:20,366
That's the Ford way.

832
01:00:26,419 --> 01:00:29,142
<i>Yet another championship win for Ferrari...</i>

833
01:00:32,034 --> 01:00:33,576
Ferrari wins.

834
01:00:36,893 --> 01:00:38,571
Wedges. We have wedges.

835
01:00:39,032 --> 01:00:40,155
Good. Good.

836
01:00:40,716 --> 01:00:42,040
Perfect.

837
01:00:42,982 --> 01:00:44,597
- 40?
- Yup.

838
01:00:54,201 --> 01:00:55,325
Hey, boss.

839
01:00:56,737 --> 01:00:58,307
You got a passport?

840
01:00:58,308 --> 01:01:00,336
- What's that?
- Sign that. Get a passport.

841
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,663
Get it back to me by Friday.

842
01:01:02,965 --> 01:01:04,848
Boys, I'm going to France.

843
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:07,438
Phil.

844
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:09,730
Ken, can I get a word?

845
01:01:18,224 --> 01:01:19,564
Can I take this?

846
01:01:21,286 --> 01:01:26,392
Do you know why Ford named it the GT-40?
Why they put the 40 on there?

847
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:28,281
- No.
- Regulations.

848
01:01:28,365 --> 01:01:33,973
We gotta be 40″ high
to make the ground clearance requirements.

849
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,685
No more, no less.
They measure it before every race.

850
01:01:36,686 --> 01:01:42,190
Problem is, that with that height
it's too much drag under the car.

851
01:01:43,357 --> 01:01:46,117
We got a solution. Wedges.
We put wedges in...

852
01:01:46,118 --> 01:01:47,803
You're not coming next week.

853
01:01:50,853 --> 01:01:52,992
You're not coming, Ken.

854
01:01:55,422 --> 01:01:58,269
We're taking McLaren.
Chris Amon. Phil Hill

855
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,291
and Bob Bondurant.

856
01:02:01,903 --> 01:02:03,459
This is Ford's call.

857
01:02:04,536 --> 01:02:06,965
It is their opinion that
you're not a good image,

858
01:02:06,966 --> 01:02:08,794
so you cannot drive their race car.

859
01:02:10,688 --> 01:02:13,449
Putting aside the fact that you made
that car whatever the hell it is,

860
01:02:14,525 --> 01:02:17,540
and you're the best man I got
behind the wheel.

861
01:02:37,404 --> 01:02:39,494
I'm gonna re-route the oil line.

862
01:02:39,495 --> 01:02:43,359
If there's spillage it could drip
onto the rear near side disc.

863
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,154
Ken.

864
01:02:44,155 --> 01:02:49,295
Tell the boys to watch
their pace come sunrise.

865
01:02:50,409 --> 01:02:53,238
The gearbox will overheat.

866
01:03:11,207 --> 01:03:13,776
Ken, race is starting soon.
Want it on the radio?

867
01:03:14,036 --> 01:03:15,713
Not unless you do.

868
01:03:38,593 --> 01:03:40,444
<i>but it's still the number
2 car driven by Chris Amon.</i>

869
01:03:40,445 --> 01:03:44,572
<i>In third place is the #1
Ford driven by Bruce McLaren.</i>

870
01:03:44,573 --> 01:03:46,533
<i>A tremendously bad start for the Ford GT.</i>

871
01:03:46,534 --> 01:03:50,728
<i>3:43 for lap for car #2 Ford.</i>

872
01:03:50,729 --> 01:03:53,625
<i>I think it's a little bit quick
for this stage of the game.</i>

873
01:03:54,721 --> 01:03:56,026
Racing too hot?

874
01:04:05,065 --> 01:04:06,640
<i>Another Ford has come in to the pit</i>

875
01:04:06,641 --> 01:04:09,139
<i>to see it pushed into
the pit by the mechanic.</i>

876
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:13,227
Head gasket.
The Car is not a moon rocket.

877
01:04:16,271 --> 01:04:18,691
<i>Leading #20 Ferrari of Michael Fahr.</i>

878
01:04:18,715 --> 01:04:21,659
So, we have Fords running one,
two, three, how about that?

879
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:24,264
Too soon. Surely too soon.

880
01:04:41,383 --> 01:04:44,049
<i>Here's a big story,
the lead Ford driven by</i>

881
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:47,557
<i>a Rickie Getzer with
gearbox trouble and the new leader...</i>

882
01:04:47,558 --> 01:04:52,500
Gearbox. I told them to be gentle with it.

883
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,787
Who's there?

884
01:05:10,165 --> 01:05:12,388
What's that you're listening to?

885
01:05:12,907 --> 01:05:15,033
Some race over in France.

886
01:05:17,971 --> 01:05:19,486
Exciting?

887
01:05:19,658 --> 01:05:22,501
Not really paying much attention.

888
01:05:39,708 --> 01:05:42,145
It's not exactly Champagne.

889
01:05:44,404 --> 01:05:46,628
Just got bubbles.

890
01:06:15,365 --> 01:06:17,274
Thanks, Mollie.

891
01:07:01,889 --> 01:07:03,558
Grace?

892
01:07:10,748 --> 01:07:11,926
Yes, sir?

893
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,794
I will sent him right in. Thank you.

894
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:21,286
Mr. Shelby, Mr. Ford will see you now.

895
01:07:21,594 --> 01:07:23,191
All right.

896
01:07:27,379 --> 01:07:29,335
This way, Mr. Shelby.

897
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:41,690
Mr. Ford, gentlemen.

898
01:07:41,966 --> 01:07:43,526
Shelby.

899
01:07:56,071 --> 01:07:59,036
Give me one reason why
I don't fire everyone

900
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:02,241
associated with this
abomination, starting with you.

901
01:08:09,098 --> 01:08:10,955
Well, sir.

902
01:08:11,556 --> 01:08:14,001
I was thinking about that very question

903
01:08:14,002 --> 01:08:16,267
as I sat out there in
your lovely waiting room.

904
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:21,683
As I was sitting there I
watched that little red folder

905
01:08:21,684 --> 01:08:25,406
right there go
through 4 pairs of hands

906
01:08:26,723 --> 01:08:28,488
before it got to you.

907
01:08:28,727 --> 01:08:33,153
Of course, I don't include the
22 or so other Ford employees

908
01:08:33,154 --> 01:08:36,149
who probably poked at it before it
made its way up to the 19th floor.

909
01:08:38,135 --> 01:08:42,964
With all due respect, sir,
you can’t win a race by committee.

910
01:08:44,392 --> 01:08:46,494
You need one man in charge.

911
01:08:46,674 --> 01:08:51,591
Now, the good news is, as I see it,
is that even with the all extra weight

912
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:57,871
we still managed to put ol' Mr. Ferrari
exactly where we want him.

913
01:08:58,183 --> 01:08:59,643
Did we?

914
01:08:59,825 --> 01:09:01,383
Oh, yes.

915
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:04,818
Expand.

916
01:09:05,495 --> 01:09:06,764
Well.

917
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:10,035
Sure, we haven't...

918
01:09:10,489 --> 01:09:12,951
We haven't worked out
how to corner yet.

919
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:18,269
Or stay cool. Or stay on the ground.

920
01:09:18,467 --> 01:09:20,515
And a lot of stuff broke.

921
01:09:21,026 --> 01:09:24,159
In fact, the only thing that didn't break
was the brakes.

922
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,998
Yeah, right now, we don't even know

923
01:09:25,999 --> 01:09:28,566
if our paint job will
last the whole 24 hours.

924
01:09:35,027 --> 01:09:40,983
But our last lap, we clocked 218 mph
down the Mulsanne straight.

925
01:09:41,266 --> 01:09:44,640
Now, in all his years of racing

926
01:09:45,327 --> 01:09:49,252
ol' Enzo ain't never seen
anything move that fast.

927
01:09:50,048 --> 01:09:53,461
And now he knows without a doubt,

928
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:57,115
we're faster than he is.

929
01:10:00,312 --> 01:10:04,715
Even with the wrong driver.
And all the committees.

930
01:10:06,261 --> 01:10:08,166
And that's what he's thinking about

931
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:11,948
while he's sitting in
Modena, Italy right now.

932
01:10:14,323 --> 01:10:16,517
That man is scared to death

933
01:10:17,358 --> 01:10:22,030
that this year you actually
might be smart enough to start trusting me.

934
01:10:24,562 --> 01:10:26,163
So, yeah.

935
01:10:27,645 --> 01:10:30,915
I'd say you got Ferrari
exactly where you want him.

936
01:10:34,225 --> 01:10:36,359
You're welcome.

937
01:10:53,427 --> 01:10:55,250
Come here.

938
01:11:02,476 --> 01:11:04,906
You see that little building down there?

939
01:11:04,907 --> 01:11:10,972
In World War II, three out of five
US bombers rolled off that line.

940
01:11:13,194 --> 01:11:17,933
You think Roosevelt beat Hitler?
Think again.

941
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:22,025
This isn't the first time
Ford Motor's gone to war in Europe.

942
01:11:23,719 --> 01:11:26,531
We know how to do more
than push paper.

943
01:11:28,606 --> 01:11:32,202
And there is one man
running this company.

944
01:11:33,613 --> 01:11:35,765
You report to him.

945
01:11:36,342 --> 01:11:38,172
You understand me?

946
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:40,076
Yes, sir.

947
01:11:40,734 --> 01:11:43,864
Go ahead, Carroll. Go to war.

948
01:11:46,434 --> 01:11:48,209
Thank you, sir.

949
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:23,225
You were right. It's a gearbox.

950
01:12:23,894 --> 01:12:25,591
We ran too hot.

951
01:12:26,403 --> 01:12:30,317
Three out of four of 'em broke.
Rod blew on other one.

952
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,283
We're goin' back, Ken.

953
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:44,252
They told me I have
a <i>carte blanche</i> this time.

954
01:12:45,619 --> 01:12:48,389
I looked up,
it's French for "horse shit".

955
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:50,327
I know they gonna squeeze
our nuts any way they can

956
01:12:50,328 --> 01:12:51,662
as soon as they work out how.

957
01:12:52,559 --> 01:12:56,559
Well, the ice cream's melting.

958
01:12:59,145 --> 01:13:00,950
All right. Hey, Ken.

959
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:03,758
You want me to apologize?

960
01:13:07,309 --> 01:13:09,146
You want me to beg?

961
01:13:09,147 --> 01:13:12,882
I don't know, let's try it out.
Let's see how that feels.

962
01:13:18,963 --> 01:13:22,401
Ken, I'm sorry. Sincerely.

963
01:13:26,906 --> 01:13:31,287
Do you have any idea the kind of shit that I
had to eat just to get 4 wheels on that grid?

964
01:13:31,288 --> 01:13:33,834
No, you don't, 'cause you don't deal
with any of that stuff.

965
01:13:34,034 --> 01:13:35,401
Now, knock it off, Ken!

966
01:13:35,402 --> 01:13:38,457
We got work to do,
and this car ain't gonna build itself.

967
01:13:46,662 --> 01:13:48,574
Okay. All right.

968
01:14:01,581 --> 01:14:03,080
Come here!

969
01:14:03,498 --> 01:14:05,378
Bloody car salesman.

970
01:14:05,379 --> 01:14:06,890
Shit!

971
01:14:09,005 --> 01:14:11,146
Come on. Now you're gonna get this.

972
01:14:15,295 --> 01:14:16,892
Get off me!

973
01:14:37,453 --> 01:14:38,912
Come here!

974
01:14:48,177 --> 01:14:49,493
Mollie, darling.

975
01:14:50,108 --> 01:14:51,544
Yes, luv?

976
01:14:51,545 --> 01:14:53,664
Could you give me a pop, please?

977
01:14:54,397 --> 01:14:56,018
Yes, luv.

978
01:14:57,486 --> 01:14:59,564
- Do you want one too, Shelby?
- No.

979
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,838
- Yes, please, Mollie.
- No, Mollie. No.

980
01:15:01,839 --> 01:15:05,360
He can get his own. Just for me, please.

981
01:15:11,594 --> 01:15:13,299
How long has that been?

982
01:15:14,056 --> 01:15:16,675
It's gotta be
three or four years at least.

983
01:15:17,301 --> 01:15:18,400
Riverside.

984
01:15:18,401 --> 01:15:22,828
Yeah, the SCCA Divisional Championship.
You broke my finger.

985
01:15:23,447 --> 01:15:25,444
What was that?

986
01:15:26,093 --> 01:15:29,095
Nippy...
Nippy bloody thing?

987
01:15:29,304 --> 01:15:30,903
You did on the arm that thing.

988
01:15:30,904 --> 01:15:32,639
Yeah. I call that "The Llama bite."

989
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,089
You named it.

990
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:37,630
Where'd you learn that?
From the girl scouts?

991
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:39,378
You wanna go again?

992
01:15:39,379 --> 01:15:40,835
Here you go.

993
01:15:41,564 --> 01:15:43,366
- You're an angel.
- Thank you.

994
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:45,158
My pleasure.

995
01:15:45,966 --> 01:15:49,854
I'm about to go to the grocery store.
Anything you think you'll need?

996
01:15:51,399 --> 01:15:57,130
Ice cream. Ice cream would be good.
And... bread.

997
01:15:58,462 --> 01:15:59,462
All right.

998
01:15:59,503 --> 01:16:01,623
No, I'm good. Thank you.

999
01:16:01,913 --> 01:16:03,499
Thanks, Mol.

1000
01:16:04,402 --> 01:16:06,423
You still taking those for you ticker?

1001
01:16:06,623 --> 01:16:09,082
Only because they're so delicious.

1002
01:16:10,370 --> 01:16:12,271
Go to hell.

1003
01:16:19,577 --> 01:16:21,234
Get it up!

1004
01:16:37,405 --> 01:16:38,776
Sam.

1005
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:41,787
Hey, Peter. Come here.

1006
01:17:00,474 --> 01:17:04,555
There's still a lag when I hit the gas.
Let's get rid of the vacuum secondaries.

1007
01:17:04,556 --> 01:17:07,620
Charlie, get a Holley carb
we're gonna rebuild the throttle assembly.

1008
01:17:07,829 --> 01:17:12,514
Three weeks to Daytona
and it still feels like a bag of squirrels.

1009
01:17:12,515 --> 01:17:15,318
Brake heat.
That's a whole different ball game.

1010
01:17:15,921 --> 01:17:18,347
All right, Petey.
Let's go for that ride.

1011
01:17:26,824 --> 01:17:28,424
What are you doing?

1012
01:17:29,681 --> 01:17:33,022
See that crack?
That's my marker for turn 8.

1013
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,642
To slow down?

1014
01:17:38,778 --> 01:17:41,210
Push of brakes and downshift.

1015
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:45,722
But you'll be going a 150 mph.

1016
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,757
Yeah.

1017
01:17:47,758 --> 01:17:49,646
So how do you see it?

1018
01:17:49,647 --> 01:17:55,374
You go fast, but as the car speeds up
everything else slows down.

1019
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:59,818
You don't do that.
You do this. All right?

1020
01:17:59,969 --> 01:18:02,375
And then you see everything.

1021
01:18:04,584 --> 01:18:06,397
Do you set other markers?

1022
01:18:06,398 --> 01:18:11,227
Indeed I do. Lot of them.

1023
01:18:13,714 --> 01:18:17,640
'Cause you can't just push the car hard
the whole way?

1024
01:18:17,641 --> 01:18:18,690
That's right.

1025
01:18:18,691 --> 01:18:24,878
You have to be kind to the car. You feel
the poor thing groaning underneath you.

1026
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:31,427
If you're gonna push a piece of machinery to
the limit and expect it to hold together,

1027
01:18:31,473 --> 01:18:35,786
you have to have some sense
of where that limit is.

1028
01:18:39,013 --> 01:18:44,004
Look out there.
Out there is the perfect line.

1029
01:18:46,147 --> 01:18:47,685
No mistakes.

1030
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:50,755
Every gear change. Every corner.

1031
01:18:52,054 --> 01:18:53,595
Perfect.

1032
01:18:54,799 --> 01:18:56,486
You see it?

1033
01:19:00,123 --> 01:19:01,735
I think so.

1034
01:19:03,415 --> 01:19:05,220
Most people can't.

1035
01:19:06,259 --> 01:19:09,187
Most people don't even know
it's out there. But it is.

1036
01:19:11,333 --> 01:19:13,022
It's there.

1037
01:19:15,553 --> 01:19:17,583
You want some ice cream?

1038
01:19:19,442 --> 01:19:20,803
Yeah.

1039
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:23,311
Come on then.

1040
01:19:23,457 --> 01:19:25,554
- You know what this marker is?
- What?

1041
01:19:25,662 --> 01:19:28,290
That one.
Pull the finger. You'll find out.

1042
01:19:49,894 --> 01:19:51,944
How much longer
before he comes in?

1043
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:55,806
We change drivers every 4 hours,
so about 10 minutes.

1044
01:19:55,807 --> 01:19:58,873
Hang on. You're saying Beebe is
a 100 % in charge now?

1045
01:19:58,874 --> 01:20:01,114
Yes. And he wants Miles gone.

1046
01:20:01,407 --> 01:20:03,203
Look, it is personal with this guy.

1047
01:20:03,593 --> 01:20:05,804
Yes. Yes, the leverage
to stick it to you.

1048
01:20:05,805 --> 01:20:08,632
He and the Deuce are flying there tomorrow.
He's gonna tell you in person.

1049
01:20:08,633 --> 01:20:11,136
All he is hoping for
is that you lose your cool.

1050
01:20:11,785 --> 01:20:13,234
It's time to let this go.

1051
01:20:13,235 --> 01:20:15,967
You cannot destroy the whole thing,
not for one goddamn guy.

1052
01:20:15,968 --> 01:20:17,845
- Sure I can.
- But why?

1053
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:21,094
'Cause while we're here talking,
he's out there getting it done.

1054
01:20:29,382 --> 01:20:31,035
Oh, shit!

1055
01:20:31,755 --> 01:20:33,333
He's got brake fail.

1056
01:20:53,347 --> 01:20:56,017
- Get him out!
- Peter! Go inside.

1057
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:57,937
Just stay there!

1058
01:20:58,232 --> 01:21:00,195
- Ken!
- Get him out!

1059
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:04,542
- Hurry!
- Ken!

1060
01:21:11,797 --> 01:21:13,479
Ken!

1061
01:21:19,934 --> 01:21:21,604
The brakes.

1062
01:21:30,895 --> 01:21:36,847
This is rip out. The damned engine.
We can't use it if we can't stop.

1063
01:21:36,848 --> 01:21:40,002
The brakes would last longer
if you slowed down a bit.

1064
01:21:40,003 --> 01:21:42,677
Wouldn't that defeat the whole purpose
of the extra power?

1065
01:21:43,448 --> 01:21:46,064
I thought the whole point was
to win the damned race.

1066
01:21:46,459 --> 01:21:52,317
Maybe we could design a new assembly.
Instead of swapping out pads in the pits,

1067
01:21:52,638 --> 01:21:56,985
swap out the entire
braking system, rotors included.

1068
01:21:57,715 --> 01:21:59,027
Put in a fresh one.

1069
01:21:59,141 --> 01:22:02,179
Wait, wait. Pops.
We're allowed to do that?

1070
01:22:02,289 --> 01:22:05,079
I don't know. I don't read French.

1071
01:22:08,136 --> 01:22:14,162
Brakes are a part like any other.
We are allowed to change parts.

1072
01:22:14,163 --> 01:22:14,809
Yes.

1073
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:16,090
Will we have time to do that?

1074
01:22:16,091 --> 01:22:18,040
I don't know yet, Charlie.

1075
01:22:18,347 --> 01:22:19,894
I'm gonna take him home.

1076
01:22:20,048 --> 01:22:21,118
All right.

1077
01:22:21,259 --> 01:22:23,609
- Sort this shit out.
- I will.

1078
01:22:33,172 --> 01:22:35,606
Have you ever been on fire?

1079
01:22:39,361 --> 01:22:41,493
No. It's never happened to me.

1080
01:22:46,432 --> 01:22:50,515
The suit's flameproof, see.
Keeps heat out.

1081
01:22:51,792 --> 01:22:52,973
Yeah.

1082
01:22:54,057 --> 01:22:58,072
But Lewis Evans burnt to death
in the Moroccan Grand Prix.

1083
01:22:58,073 --> 01:23:00,185
He had a flameproof suit on.

1084
01:23:02,475 --> 01:23:04,033
Yeah, but...

1085
01:23:06,866 --> 01:23:10,142
See, he got stuck.
He couldn't breathe.

1086
01:23:10,860 --> 01:23:14,844
So as long as you get out
of the car, you're okay.

1087
01:23:18,533 --> 01:23:20,247
Dad got out.

1088
01:23:21,471 --> 01:23:23,774
- He sure did.
- Peter.

1089
01:23:27,585 --> 01:23:30,257
- Bye.
- See ya.

1090
01:23:33,206 --> 01:23:35,281
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1091
01:23:35,876 --> 01:23:37,623
What's wrong with you?

1092
01:23:37,975 --> 01:23:41,837
Don't tell me brakes or...
Me and boys kicking the bucket out there.

1093
01:23:41,838 --> 01:23:44,586
It's something to do
with the suits, isn't it?

1094
01:23:46,606 --> 01:23:48,085
It's under control.

1095
01:23:48,086 --> 01:23:49,650
What is it?

1096
01:23:49,651 --> 01:23:52,019
You know how we talked about
you do your thing, I do my thing.

1097
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:53,105
This is my thing.

1098
01:23:53,106 --> 01:23:55,476
- Shel.
- Just trust me, Ken.

1099
01:23:55,885 --> 01:23:57,455
You got a plan?

1100
01:23:58,043 --> 01:23:59,510
Absolutely.

1101
01:23:59,861 --> 01:24:01,335
A good one?

1102
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:03,015
It's high risk.

1103
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,979
- How high risk?
- Extremely high risk.

1104
01:24:07,782 --> 01:24:09,770
Well, that's something.

1105
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,327
- Glad we had this talk.
- Anytime.

1106
01:24:24,407 --> 01:24:26,802
Mr. Ford. This is a surprise.

1107
01:24:27,529 --> 01:24:30,066
Apologies for the
unannounced intrusion, Mr. Shelby.

1108
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:33,083
A man pays 9 million dollars
for an automobile

1109
01:24:33,084 --> 01:24:35,084
he ought at least be able to see it.

1110
01:24:35,325 --> 01:24:36,917
That sounds reasonable enough.

1111
01:24:36,918 --> 01:24:39,693
- Shelby, can I have a word?
- Sure.

1112
01:24:40,019 --> 01:24:41,185
In private?

1113
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:43,287
Yeah, that would be preferable.

1114
01:24:43,288 --> 01:24:43,917
All right.

1115
01:24:43,918 --> 01:24:48,508
Phil, you wanna take care of Mr. Ford here?
Mr. Ford, that's Phil Remington.

1116
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,335
- Of course.
- Come to my office, Leo.

1117
01:24:50,336 --> 01:24:51,510
Pleasure, sir.

1118
01:24:51,716 --> 01:24:53,997
Let me give a little tour of your car.

1119
01:24:54,736 --> 01:25:00,640
We took out 289 small block
and put in 427 7 liter.

1120
01:25:03,713 --> 01:25:05,766
Firstly, I wanna just clear the air.

1121
01:25:06,057 --> 01:25:10,259
I hope that whatever disagreements
between us can just be chopped up to

1122
01:25:10,748 --> 01:25:13,771
natural red-bloodedness
in the heat of battle.

1123
01:25:13,772 --> 01:25:16,498
I appreciate that Leo. Truly I do.

1124
01:25:18,014 --> 01:25:21,496
It falls on me, Shelby,
to inform you that

1125
01:25:21,553 --> 01:25:25,569
I have been appointed overall
Executive Director of the Racing program.

1126
01:25:27,003 --> 01:25:30,705
Now, I do hope that
this won't be a problem between us.

1127
01:25:31,508 --> 01:25:33,973
I assure you, Leo. It will not.

1128
01:25:43,918 --> 01:25:45,329
Hey, Carroll!

1129
01:25:45,968 --> 01:25:46,522
Carroll!

1130
01:25:46,523 --> 01:25:49,318
And what is the top speed
with the 427th?

1131
01:25:49,319 --> 01:25:51,274
Why don't we take it for a spin?

1132
01:25:51,275 --> 01:25:51,972
What?

1133
01:25:51,973 --> 01:25:54,664
Go on, Mr. Ford.
Hope on in. Go on.

1134
01:25:54,665 --> 01:25:55,683
You want me to...

1135
01:25:55,684 --> 01:25:57,760
To see what 9 million dollars feel like.

1136
01:26:04,846 --> 01:26:05,942
Open the door!

1137
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,743
Hey! Open the door!

1138
01:26:07,908 --> 01:26:09,738
Open the door!

1139
01:26:12,349 --> 01:26:14,915
Just hold me right there.
And you take my hand.

1140
01:26:16,790 --> 01:26:19,493
Oh, God! I sat on my nuts.

1141
01:26:19,494 --> 01:26:21,991
I'm gonna build the next one
for comfort, don't you worry.

1142
01:26:30,488 --> 01:26:31,785
Open the door.

1143
01:26:31,786 --> 01:26:33,156
Sorry sir, if you would just
give me a moment?

1144
01:26:33,157 --> 01:26:34,498
Open the door!

1145
01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:36,327
You ready?

1146
01:26:36,328 --> 01:26:37,702
The name in the middle
of that steering wheel

1147
01:26:37,703 --> 01:26:39,828
should tell you that I was born
ready, Shelby.

1148
01:26:39,958 --> 01:26:41,741
- Hit it.
- Attaboy.

1149
01:26:44,877 --> 01:26:46,029
Oh, that's got a little.

1150
01:26:47,691 --> 01:26:49,655
- Open the door!
- Here we go.

1151
01:26:49,656 --> 01:26:52,321
Here we go, Mr. Beebe.
Are you okay, sir?

1152
01:26:54,702 --> 01:26:56,355
Oh my God!

1153
01:26:57,517 --> 01:27:00,347
Oh my God!

1154
01:27:11,276 --> 01:27:15,498
It's about right now they uninitiated
have a tendency to soil themselves.

1155
01:28:01,712 --> 01:28:03,105
Mr. Ford.

1156
01:28:06,762 --> 01:28:08,320
Are you okay?

1157
01:28:11,573 --> 01:28:14,427
Mr. Ford. You all right?

1158
01:28:14,428 --> 01:28:16,488
I had no idea.

1159
01:28:18,542 --> 01:28:20,278
I had no idea.

1160
01:28:22,864 --> 01:28:26,424
I wish my Daddy
were alive to see this.

1161
01:28:28,098 --> 01:28:29,927
To feel this.

1162
01:28:31,147 --> 01:28:34,354
This is not a machine just anybody
can get in and easily control.

1163
01:28:34,355 --> 01:28:37,700
Absolutely not. I had no idea.

1164
01:28:37,701 --> 01:28:39,270
You wanna win Le Mans.

1165
01:28:39,865 --> 01:28:43,331
You really wanna take 1st place,
Ken Miles is the man to do it.

1166
01:28:51,991 --> 01:28:53,550
Good timing.

1167
01:28:53,786 --> 01:28:56,468
He knows this car
because he helped me build it.

1168
01:28:57,705 --> 01:29:01,898
Shelby, you know I've already appointed
Leo Beebe Director of

1169
01:29:01,899 --> 01:29:04,371
Which is exactly
why I'm talking to you.

1170
01:29:05,156 --> 01:29:07,943
You let Ken Miles race Daytona.

1171
01:29:08,377 --> 01:29:09,771
If he wins,

1172
01:29:10,837 --> 01:29:12,770
he get to drive Le Mans.

1173
01:29:15,043 --> 01:29:16,497
And if he doesn't?

1174
01:29:17,308 --> 01:29:20,795
Ford Motor Company gets full ownership
of Shelby American.

1175
01:29:20,905 --> 01:29:23,626
Lock, stock and brand. Forever.

1176
01:29:26,897 --> 01:29:29,515
<i>We're an hour of 6 at the Daytona 24.</i>

1177
01:29:29,672 --> 01:29:32,281
<i>And Fords are dominating the leaderboard.</i>

1178
01:29:33,131 --> 01:29:36,404
<i>Shelby American's Ken Miles
holds a narrow lead over</i>

1179
01:29:36,405 --> 01:29:39,469
<i>the Holman Moody's Ford,
driven by Walt Hansgen.</i>

1180
01:29:40,256 --> 01:29:42,270
I don't bloody think so, Walt.

1181
01:30:01,353 --> 01:30:05,609
This race is not just a test of our cars,
but also our teams.

1182
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:07,742
As you know we have a second team
out there today.

1183
01:30:07,743 --> 01:30:09,482
- Holman Moody?
- That's right.

1184
01:30:15,171 --> 01:30:16,751
Walt's pushing it too fast.

1185
01:30:16,752 --> 01:30:20,366
He's pushing 7000 RPM!
Get the EZ sign out there.

1186
01:30:20,527 --> 01:30:22,315
Come on. Move! Do it now!

1187
01:30:22,316 --> 01:30:26,256
Every one of these GTs out there today
is under my direct supervision.

1188
01:30:26,386 --> 01:30:29,282
And, of course, the supervision
of Henry Ford II.

1189
01:30:29,283 --> 01:30:32,301
The drivers. The speed. The strategy.

1190
01:30:32,731 --> 01:30:35,640
Even the RPMs are determined by us.

1191
01:30:39,236 --> 01:30:41,971
<i>Ken Miles is on the furious battle
with Hansgen</i>

1192
01:30:41,972 --> 01:30:43,783
<i>as the custom ground stand.</i>

1193
01:30:47,285 --> 01:30:50,666
<i>Hansgen is taking an appointment.
Miles is to return him on.</i>

1194
01:30:53,263 --> 01:30:54,661
<i>Hansgen takes the lead...</i>

1195
01:31:05,822 --> 01:31:08,316
Oh, blimey! Did you see that?

1196
01:31:16,421 --> 01:31:17,663
We are racing.

1197
01:31:17,992 --> 01:31:20,166
- We are still racing!
- Come on, guys! Let's go!

1198
01:31:20,167 --> 01:31:22,150
- Let's go! Move it!
- He's coming in!

1199
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:25,069
Let's go! Let's go, guys!
Come on!

1200
01:31:27,338 --> 01:31:28,855
Let's go! Let's go! Move!

1201
01:31:33,988 --> 01:31:36,152
Hansgen is right up our arse.

1202
01:31:36,311 --> 01:31:38,144
If I can get outta the pit
ahead of him.

1203
01:31:38,145 --> 01:31:40,892
She's running hot.
But I think she'll hold.

1204
01:31:42,306 --> 01:31:43,997
She's hot.

1205
01:31:45,704 --> 01:31:47,730
Hey, Walt. Good to see you.

1206
01:31:47,981 --> 01:31:50,604
After I get out of this pit, Shelby.
It's the last time you will.

1207
01:31:50,605 --> 01:31:53,276
Don't worry. We've got rear view mirrors.

1208
01:31:54,411 --> 01:31:56,332
What happened to that Mustang
he took out?

1209
01:31:56,697 --> 01:31:58,065
Don't know yet.

1210
01:31:58,372 --> 01:32:02,661
I can push her harder than 6, Shel.
I can feel it.

1211
01:32:08,443 --> 01:32:10,880
How come these guys's pit
so much faster than we do?

1212
01:32:11,245 --> 01:32:14,452
We got a goddamn
NASCAR crew, that's why.

1213
01:32:14,913 --> 01:32:16,847
- No shit?
- No shit.

1214
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,045
Goddamn NASCAR crew.

1215
01:32:25,556 --> 01:32:27,091
Guys, they've already left!

1216
01:32:29,846 --> 01:32:30,846
Hello?

1217
01:32:30,955 --> 01:32:33,014
That's my Mollie. Hello.

1218
01:32:33,593 --> 01:32:34,813
Hi, luv.

1219
01:32:35,041 --> 01:32:36,603
What are you doing?

1220
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:37,676
Just having a...

1221
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:39,459
Mom, ask him about the brakes!

1222
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:40,975
Go to bed. It's 1 AM.

1223
01:32:40,976 --> 01:32:43,243
- Ask him.
- Go to bed! Now!

1224
01:32:43,822 --> 01:32:45,361
I take it he's not asleep.

1225
01:32:45,362 --> 01:32:47,336
I'm sure he smuggled in the radio.

1226
01:32:48,658 --> 01:32:50,068
He said to ask how are the brakes.

1227
01:32:50,069 --> 01:32:53,930
The brakes. Yes.
Tell him they're working. For now.

1228
01:32:54,447 --> 01:32:56,684
Shelby's been acting very strange.

1229
01:32:57,007 --> 01:33:00,330
Ford's gonna push up
another team with a GT.

1230
01:33:00,331 --> 01:33:04,509
Some sort of a yampy bloody corporate test
or something, I don't know.

1231
01:33:04,647 --> 01:33:06,296
Take a rest whenever you get a chance.

1232
01:33:06,297 --> 01:33:07,753
Sorry, my luv. What you were saying?

1233
01:33:07,754 --> 01:33:09,256
You've only got a few hours.

1234
01:33:09,257 --> 01:33:13,035
I can't hear you very well.
I'm sorry, I can't hear ya. Wish me luck.

1235
01:33:13,184 --> 01:33:15,194
- Good luck.
- I love you, darling.

1236
01:33:15,620 --> 01:33:20,384
<i>After 23 hours here at Daytona,
Walt Hansgen, driving green and white Ford</i>

over Ken Miles and Shelby America.</i>

1238

We're locked out, ain't nothing
Miles can do this late in the race.

1239
01:33:31,993 --> 01:33:34,758
Engine's hot, we gotta keep it under 6.

1240
01:34:22,311 --> 01:34:24,275
All right.

1241
01:34:48,985 --> 01:34:50,746
She could come apart.

1242
01:34:50,902 --> 01:34:52,476
One way to find out.

1243
01:34:55,415 --> 01:34:58,049
I thought we were keeping him under 6000.

1244
01:34:58,124 --> 01:34:59,681
Shut up, Don.

1245

01:37:02,578 --> 01:37:03,721
Dammit!

1259
01:37:20,582 --> 01:37:22,252
How about that?

1260
01:37:33,596 --> 01:37:34,502
Yes. Leo?

1261
01:37:34,503 --> 01:37:37,015
Mr. Ford, sir. We won.

1262
01:37:38,638 --> 01:37:40,988
We won. Ford won Daytona.

1263
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:44,928
And which team was it, Leo?

1264
01:37:45,798 --> 01:37:48,751
Shelby American. Miles driving.

1265
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,904
Son of a bitch.

1266
01:37:54,041 --> 01:37:57,401
Where the hell is he?
Hang on. Wait a minute.

1267
01:37:57,769 --> 01:38:00,490
Has someone lost a bulldog on the beach?

1268
01:38:01,276 --> 01:38:03,552
No, no. Come on, Come on.

1269
01:38:07,265 --> 01:38:09,219
Someone get this man a drink.

1270
01:38:27,919 --> 01:38:30,321
In bed you!
What are you doing?

1271
01:38:30,702 --> 01:38:32,488
Dirty stop out.

1272
01:38:32,919 --> 01:38:37,823
I was drawing a map,
so I could follow you on Le Mans.

1273
01:38:41,938 --> 01:38:43,489
Oh God.

1274
01:38:44,423 --> 01:38:46,122
All these buttons.

1275
01:38:46,652 --> 01:38:48,754
Dark pen, very accurate.

1276
01:38:50,190 --> 01:38:53,390
- Tell me about the track.
- No, I can't, Petey.

1277
01:38:53,941 --> 01:38:55,582
Please.

1278
01:39:03,772 --> 01:39:05,963
We start at the start line.

1279
01:39:06,677 --> 01:39:10,252
You actually start here, because you
have to run to your car at Le Mans.

1280
01:39:10,253 --> 01:39:11,523
True enough.

1281
01:39:12,430 --> 01:39:16,695
Once your old man
manages to hobble over and pull out.

1282
01:39:17,001 --> 01:39:19,258
- And not hit anyone.
- Yes, right.

1283
01:39:20,934 --> 01:39:24,992
Accelerate, very hard up to Dunlop bridge.

1284
01:39:25,447 --> 01:39:29,896
Road braking away from you.
Then down through the trees to the Esses.

1285
01:39:30,219 --> 01:39:34,808
Accelerate up to Terte Rouge,
critical first gear corner.

1286
01:39:35,227 --> 01:39:41,977
Fast entry, keep your speed up
for your exit onto Mulsanne.

1287
01:39:42,347 --> 01:39:46,312
Long straight-away,
hemmed in by poplars. Top gear.

1288
01:39:46,768 --> 01:39:52,779
210 mph, then down to third,
revs up, ribs are your friend.

1289
01:39:53,338 --> 01:39:58,852
Get a maximum exit. Let the car run free.
Over the brow

1290
01:39:59,141 --> 01:40:05,746
then wham, the Mulsanne Corner.
Accelerate to Arnage.

1291
01:40:06,015 --> 01:40:09,689
Over the rise to the White House.
You get that right and...

1292
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:17,790
Your first 3.5 minutes of the 24 hours.

1293
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:24,668
You can’t make every lap perfect.

1294
01:40:26,226 --> 01:40:28,302
But I can try.

1295
01:40:33,535 --> 01:40:36,860
All right. Off to bed you.

1296
01:40:40,025 --> 01:40:45,307
I will wake you before I leave for France.

1297
01:40:45,721 --> 01:40:47,265
I promise.

1298
01:40:47,438 --> 01:40:49,935
Okay. Goodnight.

1299
01:41:19,890 --> 01:41:22,305
Where is that? Hotel Champier?

1300
01:42:11,639 --> 01:42:13,815
It's gonna rain again tomorrow.

1301
01:42:18,865 --> 01:42:20,686
There's always rain here.

1302
01:42:23,538 --> 01:42:25,535
Start will be dry, though.

1303
01:42:26,691 --> 01:42:28,999
We'll swap back your tires come rain.

1304
01:42:31,338 --> 01:42:32,890
Yeah.

1305
01:42:35,810 --> 01:42:39,592
Might be smart to sleep, bulldog.

1306
01:42:41,421 --> 01:42:42,982
You too.

1307
01:42:43,777 --> 01:42:45,619
I'm not driving.

1308
01:42:48,098 --> 01:42:50,975
That's a bloody shame.

1309
01:42:51,343 --> 01:42:53,754
Hell, I couldn't have made this team.

1310
01:42:58,381 --> 01:43:00,582
I'm gonna walk to first corner.

1311
01:43:02,199 --> 01:43:03,948
I figured.

1312
01:43:14,441 --> 01:43:16,256
Counting on it.

1313
01:43:50,116 --> 01:43:51,398
Hey, Ken.

1314
01:43:51,570 --> 01:43:53,017
Charles.

1315
01:44:07,228 --> 01:44:11,455
If this was a beauty pageant,
we just lost.

1316
01:44:12,612 --> 01:44:14,075
Looks fast. Doesn't it?

1317
01:44:14,524 --> 01:44:16,488
Looks aren't everything.

1318
01:44:20,483 --> 01:44:23,540
Scarfiotti and Bandini
to start for Ferrari.

1319
01:44:29,226 --> 01:44:30,259
You can take him.

1320
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:32,579
4 minutes, Ken.
4 minutes, buddy.

1321
01:44:32,758 --> 01:44:35,726
- <i>Live from Le Mans, France.</i>
- Mom! Come on!

1322
01:44:36,268 --> 01:44:38,215
All right. I'm coming.

1323
01:44:38,527 --> 01:44:40,875
<i>The 24 Hours of Le Mans.</i>

1324
01:44:45,784 --> 01:44:48,188
<i>Drivers, please take your places.</i>

1325
01:45:06,731 --> 01:45:09,874
- There he is.
- <i>And here they are lined up. Ready to go.</i>

1326
01:46:03,232 --> 01:46:04,677
Bloody Joseph!

1327
01:46:13,810 --> 01:46:15,150
It's all right, son.

1328
01:46:17,896 --> 01:46:19,866
You looked great out there, sir.

1329
01:46:20,516 --> 01:46:22,092
What happened to Miles?

1330
01:46:30,706 --> 01:46:32,475
Bloody hell!

1331
01:46:43,034 --> 01:46:44,249
Bastard!

1332
01:47:19,972 --> 01:47:23,629
<i>After Dunlop Bandini,
Ferrari is in first place.</i>

1333
01:47:27,708 --> 01:47:29,352
Where's Miles?

1334
01:47:31,359 --> 01:47:33,580
- Where the hell is Ken?
- I don't know.

1335
01:47:42,665 --> 01:47:45,219
He's coming in.

1336
01:47:45,220 --> 01:47:47,869
Let's go! Faster! Come on!
Let's Go! Move it!

1337
01:47:48,209 --> 01:47:49,912
I think it's his door.

1338
01:47:49,913 --> 01:47:52,082
<i>That's a rough start for the Ford team.</i>

1339
01:47:55,578 --> 01:47:58,647
The bloody door won't close!

1340
01:47:58,648 --> 01:48:00,915
- All right. All right.
- Maybe it's the heat.

1341
01:48:03,914 --> 01:48:04,770
Try that.

1342
01:48:04,771 --> 01:48:06,979
Shelby! What the hell is wrong?

1343
01:48:07,856 --> 01:48:10,896
- Something's hitting the frame.
- Oh, you're joking, aren't you?

1344
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:12,918
Guys, get out of the way!

1345
01:48:13,064 --> 01:48:14,761
Get out of the way! Hold.

1346
01:48:16,041 --> 01:48:17,680
Go! Go! Go!

1347
01:48:25,928 --> 01:48:27,900
He's back out. Go!

1348
01:48:54,917 --> 01:48:57,495
<i>Tremendous games for Ken Miles and Ford...</i>

1349
01:48:57,496 --> 01:49:00,238
Come on dad. Come on.

1350
01:49:08,470 --> 01:49:11,014
<i>Ken Miles, Ford. A new lap record.</i>

1351
01:49:11,173 --> 01:49:13,336
<i>3 minutes and 34 seconds.</i>

1352
01:49:29,281 --> 01:49:33,460
Shelby, he's pushing the car too hard.
That's not the plan.

1353
01:49:34,344 --> 01:49:35,908
Plan's changed.

1354
01:50:03,278 --> 01:50:06,445
Lap is 3.34. Track is 8.36.

1355
01:50:06,591 --> 01:50:08,937
Someone tell me the mph!

1356
01:50:17,876 --> 01:50:19,848
<i>3:31.9 that's a...</i>

1357
01:50:19,849 --> 01:50:21,504
Another lap record.

1358
01:50:27,095 --> 01:50:28,739
Let's go. Let's go, boys!

1359
01:50:29,283 --> 01:50:32,041
- Tea is ready, Ken.
- Thank you, Chase.

1360
01:50:32,444 --> 01:50:35,591
- Happy Birthday, old chap.
- Cheers, mate. Great run.

1361
01:50:44,694 --> 01:50:46,494
You're 3 seconds
faster than Gurney.

1362
01:50:46,610 --> 01:50:49,047
If you hadn't blown the
start you'd be in the lead.

1363
01:50:49,131 --> 01:50:51,841
- Can you keep this up?
- Can the car?

1364
01:50:54,245 --> 01:50:59,205
<i>There has been an incident on turn 6.
♪ 18 and ♪26 have collided.</i>

1365
01:51:24,361 --> 01:51:27,633
<i>It appears, Ferrari, #20,

1366
01:51:27,634 --> 01:51:29,634
<i>has also left the track.</i>

1367
01:51:38,797 --> 01:51:41,625
- All right, watch your head.
- Thank you.

1368
01:51:41,874 --> 01:51:43,880
Have a good dinner, sir.

1369
01:51:44,447 --> 01:51:46,341
McLaren's pitting.

1370
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:52,219
Mr. Ford is probably going
somewhere nice for dinner.

1371
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:54,132
What do you mean "probably"?

1372
01:51:54,133 --> 01:51:55,457
Rain's coming.

1373
01:51:55,627 --> 01:51:56,878
All right.

1374
01:52:12,605 --> 01:52:14,110
Coming in.

1375
01:52:22,543 --> 01:52:24,707
- Engine's running hot, Pops.
- All right.

1376
01:52:24,870 --> 01:52:26,399
She's hot, mate. Break on.

1377
01:52:29,409 --> 01:52:30,716
Tire.

1378
01:52:37,398 --> 01:52:40,247
- We're 220. We're okay.
- All right.

1379
01:52:44,457 --> 01:52:46,362
- Let's go.
- Swap that out.

1380
01:52:57,353 --> 01:52:58,708
Go! Go!

1381
01:53:06,171 --> 01:53:07,753
I need a stopwatch.

1382
01:53:37,648 --> 01:53:42,003
<i>Lorenzo Bandini remains

Easy, Dan. You're getting boxed in.

1384
01:53:58,571 --> 01:54:00,595
He's not backing,
and a full wicked that one.

1385
01:54:06,468 --> 01:54:08,211
Easy, Dan.

1386
01:54:09,630 --> 01:54:11,232

01:54:12,474 --> 01:54:14,515

01:54:44,004 --> 01:54:46,796
Face like a sprat arse, don't ya?

1390

<i>Porsche #58 with an unidentified Ford

01:56:06,455 --> 01:56:08,143
Okay, sir.

01:56:14,935 --> 01:56:16,203
Hey!

1401

Come on, girl. Come on.

1405
01:57:20,123 --> 01:57:22,159

<i>It looks like Ken Miles is bringing

All right. Let's go! Let's Go!

1412

1415
01:58:20,352 --> 01:58:22,352

1416
01:58:25,186 --> 01:58:26,984
Faster! Faster!

1417
01:58:46,077 --> 01:58:48,933
Against the rules.
You can't just change things.

1418
01:58:48,934 --> 01:58:49,938
No, no, no.

1419
01:58:49,939 --> 01:58:51,790
You show me where it says in your book

1420
01:58:51,791 --> 01:58:56,155
that we cannot swap out the system
and then you can disqualify us.

1421
01:58:56,156 --> 01:58:58,067
- This is not legal.
- Calm down. Calm down.

1422
01:58:58,068 --> 01:58:58,901
This is not legal.

1423
01:58:58,902 --> 01:59:01,215
You show me where it
says in that little rule book

1424
01:59:01,216 --> 01:59:03,630
where I can't swap out
my upright assembly.

1425
01:59:03,631 --> 01:59:04,745
A part is a part.

1426
01:59:04,746 --> 01:59:06,690
Be it a brake caliper or a rotor
or an upright assembly

1427
01:59:06,691 --> 01:59:08,696
and I can swap out
any damn thing I want to.

1428
01:59:09,855 --> 01:59:11,615
We read your damn rule book.

1429
01:59:17,430 --> 01:59:19,762
Bandini's pitting! He's pitting!

1430
01:59:27,079 --> 01:59:29,808
What a shame. I think he blew the line.

1431
01:59:30,063 --> 01:59:31,967
He was trying to keep up with you.

1432
01:59:41,466 --> 01:59:43,819
I don't speak Italian, but he ain't happy.

1433
01:59:55,084 --> 01:59:57,664
Get me out of here, Pops.
Come on!

1434
01:59:58,696 --> 02:00:00,229
Almost set, Ken.

1435
02:00:05,876 --> 02:00:08,038
You can still take him,
but you gotta pass him twice.

1436
02:00:08,039 --> 02:00:10,173
I got it. Pass him twice.

1437
02:00:17,113 --> 02:00:22,508
<i>Ford #1, driven by Ken Miles is back on.
Hot on the heels of Bandini in Ferrari 21.</i>

1438
02:01:20,423 --> 02:01:23,528
Not bloody got it off me, are you?
Comes on!

1439
02:01:24,165 --> 02:01:25,961
He's off his pace.

1440
02:01:27,186 --> 02:01:29,223
He doesn't trust the car yet.

1441
02:01:29,625 --> 02:01:32,502
Come on, Ken.
I gave you the new brakes, buddy.

1442
02:01:38,490 --> 02:01:40,039
All right.

1443
02:01:41,333 --> 02:01:43,128
What'd you come here for?

1444
02:01:45,480 --> 02:01:47,307
Let's do it.

1445
02:02:11,240 --> 02:02:13,108
See? Come on!

1446
02:02:24,216 --> 02:02:25,939
He ain't done it yet.

1447
02:02:29,365 --> 02:02:31,435
He needs to take another lap on him.

1448
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:59,069
- He needs to pit soon.
- He needs to catch Bandini first.

1449
02:03:09,527 --> 02:03:11,132
All right, you bastard.

1450
02:03:12,308 --> 02:03:13,904
Let's do this again.

1451
02:03:43,296 --> 02:03:44,459
Come on, girl.

1452
02:03:45,002 --> 02:03:47,563
That's my girl! That's my girl!

1453
02:04:07,204 --> 02:04:09,950
Oh my God!

1454
02:04:10,473 --> 02:04:12,217
Bloody hell!

1455
02:04:25,673 --> 02:04:27,998
He did it. We're in the lead.

1456
02:04:28,323 --> 02:04:29,696
Are we in the lead?

1457
02:04:29,810 --> 02:04:31,543
What about Bandini?

1458
02:04:32,278 --> 02:04:33,891
Where's Bandini?

1459
02:04:34,294 --> 02:04:37,844
He's done. Finished. Ferrari's over.

1460
02:04:37,845 --> 02:04:39,972
McLaren's 4 minutes behind him in a GT.

1461
02:04:39,973 --> 02:04:43,864
Should we line them: Ken first,
and 2 and 3. All Fords.

1462
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:07,404
The Deuce is coming.

1463
02:05:16,079 --> 02:05:19,089
Ken's up in a half an hour.
Do you want me to wake him?

1464
02:05:19,090 --> 02:05:20,854
No, let him sleep.

1465
02:05:22,166 --> 02:05:24,003
- Unbelievable.
- Thank you.

1466
02:05:24,287 --> 02:05:26,242
- Good job.
- Not quite there yet, but...

1467
02:05:27,611 --> 02:05:29,288
There he is.

1468
02:05:31,148 --> 02:05:32,833
Brief me, Leo.

1469
02:05:33,103 --> 02:05:35,454
We're running one, two, three, Mr. Ford.

1470
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:38,750
- Who's in the lead?
- Him. Miles.

1471
02:05:41,595 --> 02:05:43,655
I was thinking, Mr. Ford.

1472
02:05:44,082 --> 02:05:47,176
Wouldn't it be great
if all three fords lined up

1473
02:05:47,177 --> 02:05:50,216
across the finish line
the exact same time?

1474
02:05:50,406 --> 02:05:52,486
They'll line up and came home together.

1475
02:05:52,487 --> 02:05:55,157
Ford. Ford. Ford.

1476
02:05:55,614 --> 02:05:57,700
I don't think we can actually do that, sir.

1477
02:05:58,899 --> 02:06:00,312
Why not?

1478
02:06:00,995 --> 02:06:06,034
Miles is laps ahead, Leo.
What would you have him to, slow down?

1479
02:06:07,533 --> 02:06:09,093
Yeah.

1480
02:06:20,689 --> 02:06:22,610
He thinks it would be
a historic moment for Ford,

1481
02:06:22,611 --> 02:06:24,182
it'll make him a great photograph.

1482
02:06:25,997 --> 02:06:28,500
Shelby, Miles needs to be
a team player here.

1483
02:06:28,831 --> 02:06:30,000
And so do you.

1484
02:06:30,118 --> 02:06:31,994
Are you gonna tell him or
do you need me to?

1485
02:06:33,550 --> 02:06:36,039
Don't go near my driver. Go on.

1486
02:06:37,009 --> 02:06:39,591
- This is what Mr. Ford wants.
- Go on now.

1487
02:06:40,213 --> 02:06:42,253
- He expects loyalty.
- Go on.

1488
02:06:59,130 --> 02:07:02,726
Guys. Stan, come on.
Let's go.

1489
02:07:06,629 --> 02:07:08,007
What'd Beebe want?

1490
02:07:13,962 --> 02:07:15,642
It's off the scale, isn't it?

1491
02:07:21,075 --> 02:07:23,209
They want you to slow down.

1492
02:07:26,977 --> 02:07:28,853
Run that part to me again.

1493
02:07:29,102 --> 02:07:31,087
They want you to slow down.

1494
02:07:33,582 --> 02:07:36,670
You're outshining the car, Ken.
You're 4 minutes up on McLaren.

1495
02:07:36,671 --> 02:07:37,995
The Deuce wants the three fords

1496
02:07:37,996 --> 02:07:40,611
across the finish line:
one, two, three, all together.

1497
02:07:46,316 --> 02:07:49,294
They're asking that you be a team player.

1498
02:07:50,077 --> 02:07:51,949
To make that photograph happen.

1499
02:07:51,950 --> 02:07:55,639
A photograph. That's good.

1500
02:07:55,640 --> 02:07:58,140
That is good!

1501
02:08:00,279 --> 02:08:05,266
Ken, even if you tie for first,
you'll still be first man ever to win

1502
02:08:05,497 --> 02:08:08,426
Sebring, Daytona, Le Mans at the same year.

1503
02:08:08,916 --> 02:08:11,029
You'll have the triple crown.

1504
02:08:20,614 --> 02:08:23,534
I am unable to get you
to follow an order since day one.

1505
02:08:23,892 --> 02:08:26,257
Whatever you wanna do
is fine with me.

1506
02:08:27,590 --> 02:08:29,377
My choice?

1507
02:08:30,465 --> 02:08:32,227
Your choice.

1508
02:08:38,412 --> 02:08:42,067
Engine's running at boiling.
The brakes are shot.

1509
02:08:45,136 --> 02:08:46,625
How was that?

1510
02:08:47,963 --> 02:08:49,032
Taken care of.

1511
02:08:49,217 --> 02:08:52,725
The car is yours, Ken.
Ken, the car is yours.

1512
02:08:54,350 --> 02:08:56,373
Car is yours, Ken.

1513
02:09:29,203 --> 02:09:32,751
<i>It's the Fords that have the cars
to be blaming the top 3 positions.</i>

1514
02:09:32,752 --> 02:09:34,528
What the hell is he doing?

1515
02:09:39,427 --> 02:09:42,115
Don't answer that!
Get away from it!

1516
02:09:42,264 --> 02:09:43,878
Get away from it!

1517
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:13,282
- He's gonna break his own record.
- Shut up!

1518
02:10:22,244 --> 02:10:23,888
Wait for it.

1519
02:10:25,509 --> 02:10:26,946
Wait for it.

1520
02:10:29,944 --> 02:10:31,068
Now.

1521
02:10:36,831 --> 02:10:39,403
Miles!

1522
02:11:14,774 --> 02:11:16,531
Benissimo.

1523
02:11:16,653 --> 02:11:20,167
3:30.6.
That's another record.

1524
02:11:25,834 --> 02:11:28,053
That's a perfect lap.

1525
02:11:28,054 --> 02:11:29,936
<i>And virtually guaranteeing the 1st place</i>

1526
02:11:29,937 --> 02:11:33,413
<i>for Shelby American and
their exciting GT Ford.</i>

1527
02:11:33,546 --> 02:11:40,764
<i>Ken Miles and Shelby American's Ford #1
just beat his own lap record, 3:30.6.</i>

1528
02:11:40,765 --> 02:11:43,757
Bring him in! Right now!
He's outta control!

1529
02:11:44,205 --> 02:11:47,288
Bring him in before he wrecks that car
and we don't finish!

1530
02:11:49,483 --> 02:11:50,839
Bring him in, Shelby!

1531
02:11:50,992 --> 02:11:54,156
Or I will get you banned
from the SCCA and the FIA.

1532
02:11:55,616 --> 02:11:59,830
Ken Miles is behind the wheel, Leo.
That's his car to the finish.

1533
02:13:34,902 --> 02:13:37,143
Come on, lads. Where are you?

1534
02:13:47,840 --> 02:13:49,497
What's he doing?

1535
02:13:50,076 --> 02:13:52,387
Mom, why is he slowing down?

1536
02:14:24,013 --> 02:14:26,453
The three fords are going to
cross the line together.

1537
02:14:26,717 --> 02:14:28,885
Ken Miles slowed down.
He waited for them.

1538
02:14:29,119 --> 02:14:31,645
Dad? No.

1539
02:14:31,780 --> 02:14:32,712
- It's all right.
- Dad.

1540
02:14:32,713 --> 02:14:35,112
It's all right. He's bringing them in.

1541
02:14:35,113 --> 02:14:36,173
<i>Lead by Ken Miles...</i>

1542
02:14:36,174 --> 02:14:39,334
- He's bringing them all in together.
- <i>He's certainly the leader of this group.</i>

1543
02:14:40,093 --> 02:14:41,732
Good for you.

1544
02:14:42,365 --> 02:14:44,100
Good for you, Ken.

1545
02:15:11,371 --> 02:15:13,135
Look at that!

1546
02:15:14,888 --> 02:15:16,485
Well done, Leo.

1547
02:15:36,802 --> 02:15:40,087
Explain to me how he's finished first
if he's not won the race?

1548
02:15:40,133 --> 02:15:44,193
Because McLaren started from further,
so he came into and he won.

1549
02:15:44,252 --> 02:15:45,753
It's not a tie!

1550
02:15:46,079 --> 02:15:48,402
Because McLaren started further
back, they're saying.

1551
02:15:48,403 --> 02:15:51,127
He's traveled a little bit further.
So, he's won and not Ken.

1552
02:15:51,128 --> 02:15:52,906
That's bullshit!

1553
02:15:53,046 --> 02:15:55,024
Shel! Hold on!

1554
02:16:09,067 --> 02:16:11,867
Where is the tie?
Where is the goddamn tie?

1555
02:16:11,991 --> 02:16:12,991
What?

1556
02:16:13,212 --> 02:16:14,212
You son of a bitch!

1557
02:16:14,724 --> 02:16:16,075
- You knew!
- I didn't, I swear.

1558
02:16:16,076 --> 02:16:17,574
Enough!

1559
02:16:20,092 --> 02:16:22,345
Nice race, mate. Cograts.

1560
02:16:44,074 --> 02:16:45,766
Shel!

1561
02:16:49,710 --> 02:16:51,408
They robbed you, Ken.

1562
02:16:51,409 --> 02:16:55,737
<i>Here's the clarification. Both the
drivers finished the race in a heat.</i>

1563
02:16:55,871 --> 02:16:59,342
<i>McLaren has been ruled the winner
as he started from further back.</i>

1564
02:16:59,343 --> 02:17:01,871
Some bullshit technicality.

1565
02:17:15,039 --> 02:17:17,080
I never should've asked you.

1566
02:17:22,699 --> 02:17:24,850
Selling ties, yeah?

1567
02:17:27,130 --> 02:17:28,886
That's what they do.

1568
02:17:30,939 --> 02:17:33,412
You promised me the drive,

1569
02:17:35,551 --> 02:17:37,515
not the win.

1570
02:17:38,015 --> 02:17:40,114
It was a hell of a drive.

1571
02:17:40,640 --> 02:17:42,568
She's a hell of a machine.

1572
02:17:43,026 --> 02:17:44,720
She's fast.

1573
02:17:46,155 --> 02:17:47,927
Could be faster.

1574
02:17:49,472 --> 02:17:52,044
The 7 liters sweet.

1575
02:17:53,805 --> 02:17:59,310
We still need a lighter chassis.
I was thinking bonded aluminum.

1576
02:17:59,406 --> 02:18:05,264
It's a ground up rebuild, but if it works
we can lose a couple of hundred pounds.

1577
02:18:05,412 --> 02:18:07,430
What the hell are we doing here?

1578
02:18:08,754 --> 02:18:11,154
Let me take the shower,
get a cup of tea.

1579
02:18:11,303 --> 02:18:13,061
Have a sandwich or something.

1580
02:18:13,683 --> 02:18:16,081
We gonna get the bastards the next year.

1581
02:18:39,914 --> 02:18:42,474
Got a bit of fuel left in the tank.

1582
02:18:43,427 --> 02:18:47,388
What do you think of those honeycomb
panels. What you were looking for?

1583
02:18:47,389 --> 02:18:49,766
I don't know yet.

1584
02:19:14,140 --> 02:19:16,580
She looks pretty good.

1585
02:19:26,221 --> 02:19:29,977
There's a point at 7000 RPM

1586
02:19:31,098 --> 02:19:33,713
where everything fades.

1587
02:19:35,704 --> 02:19:40,778
The machine becomes weightless.
Just disappears.

1588
02:19:42,196 --> 02:19:47,271
And all that left is a body
moving through space and time.

1589
02:19:50,028 --> 02:19:55,256
7000 RPM, that's where you meet it.

1590
02:19:56,664 --> 02:20:01,432
You feel it coming.
It creeps up on you, close in your ear,

1591
02:20:08,953 --> 02:20:13,772
and asks you a question.
The only question that matters.

1592
02:20:21,830 --> 02:20:23,989
"Who are you"?

1593
02:20:57,123 --> 02:20:58,213
What do you think?

1594
02:20:58,214 --> 02:21:02,850
It's fantastic!
That was really good. Nice and smooth.

1595
02:21:03,818 --> 02:21:06,077
No vibration in the box.
She's really strong.

1596
02:21:06,078 --> 02:21:10,643
You drove her for less than an hour.
You can't tell shit after an hour.

1597
02:21:13,935 --> 02:21:15,868
Hey, Shel.

1598
02:21:25,235 --> 02:21:30,815
Hey, Shell. That guy, the one in the hat.
He's ready to close on those two 427's.

1599
02:21:30,888 --> 02:21:36,909
His and hers. Full freight.
They flew in from Galveston.

1600
02:21:40,691 --> 02:21:43,815
I need you to come outside
for maybe a minute.

1601
02:21:44,271 --> 02:21:46,080
And do what?

1602
02:21:47,374 --> 02:21:49,385
Be Carroll Shelby.

1603
02:21:49,895 --> 02:21:52,755
Tell them a story.
Spin a few magic words.

1604
02:21:53,147 --> 02:21:56,165
What does that mean? Magic words?

1605
02:21:57,141 --> 02:22:00,828
It means, come
outside, and say hello,

1606
02:22:00,829 --> 02:22:02,853
and make them feel good
about their purchase.

1607
02:22:02,862 --> 02:22:06,338
They're getting the damn cars.
That's what they get for their money, Phil.

1608
02:22:06,464 --> 02:22:09,434
Either they want them or they don’t.
Am I some kind of a lounge act?!

1609
02:22:09,550 --> 02:22:12,218
Am I here to talk people into things?!

1610
02:22:23,024 --> 02:22:25,522
It's been 6 months, Shel.

1611
02:22:26,339 --> 02:22:28,421
Six months.

1612
02:22:32,404 --> 02:22:35,251
Sometimes, they don't get
out of the car.

1613
02:23:10,078 --> 02:23:11,925
Peter!

1614
02:23:12,378 --> 02:23:14,960
Peter, come and take the garbage out!

1615
02:23:14,961 --> 02:23:17,125
Mr. Shelby?

1616
02:23:18,125 --> 02:23:19,693
Hello, Pete.

1617
02:23:21,366 --> 02:23:23,422
I remember that wrench.

1618
02:23:24,154 --> 02:23:25,975
My Dad threw it at you.

1619
02:23:27,244 --> 02:23:29,009
I believe he did.

1620
02:23:29,444 --> 02:23:30,735
Why?

1621
02:23:35,578 --> 02:23:38,048
I think I probably
said something to him.

1622
02:23:38,687 --> 02:23:40,470
Called him a few names.

1623
02:23:42,232 --> 02:23:44,046
That's right.

1624
02:23:52,514 --> 02:23:54,689
Do you wanna speak to my Mom?

1625
02:23:54,814 --> 02:24:00,090
I did. I came to say hello
and check in on her.

1626
02:24:04,572 --> 02:24:07,370
Then, I started thinking that sometimes

1627
02:24:09,167 --> 02:24:16,089
the words just are not useful.

1628
02:24:21,798 --> 02:24:24,377
Tools are useful 'cause you
can make stuff with 'em,

1629
02:24:24,378 --> 02:24:26,402
and you can fix stuff with 'em.

1630
02:24:27,423 --> 02:24:28,916
Here.

1631
02:24:29,852 --> 02:24:31,513
Thanks.

1632
02:24:39,646 --> 02:24:42,150
Your Daddy was a...

1633
02:24:44,807 --> 02:24:47,266
He was your friend.

1634
02:24:52,684 --> 02:24:54,608
Yes, he was.

1635
02:24:55,372 --> 02:24:57,114
Yes, sir.

1636
02:25:01,903 --> 02:25:05,338
And he thought
you were just finer than frog fur.

1637
02:25:09,225 --> 02:25:10,941
Peter!

1638
02:25:16,010 --> 02:25:18,478
I think I've gotta go help my Mom.

1639
02:25:20,213 --> 02:25:23,179
What are you doing here then? Go on.

1640
02:25:23,535 --> 02:25:25,619
Bye.
