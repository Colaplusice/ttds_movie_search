<i>MOTHER</i>

2
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,050
At ease!

3
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,550
Salute!

4
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,050
Do-joon!

5
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,750
Hey, Benz! You asshole!

6
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,950
Do-joon, are you okay?

7
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,450
Oh no, blood!

8
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,250
Oh no, blood!
Do-joon, you're bleeding!

9
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,850
Shit, mom, get back in the store!

10
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,850
You're bleeding!

11
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,450
He's bleeding!

12
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,550
I knew it!
This is your own blood!

13
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,750
To the golf course.
Royal Palace Country Club!

14
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,150
Did they go there?

15
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,350
You idiot,

16
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,150
Where else in this town
would a Benz be going?

17
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,150
Is this hit-and-run?

18
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,750
Bastards who slam on the gas
after hitting someone

19
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,550
deserve to have
their faces slammed.

20
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,050
Look!

21
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,850
- I'm bleeding!
- All right, All right.

22
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,350
Plate number 5362...
White Benz...

23
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,450
It's 5293, idiot.
A black Benz, fuck.

24
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,450
Ah, a black Benz, black...

25
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,750
How could you mix up...

26
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,350
It could happen.

27
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,250
For you, it could...
That head of yours is special.

28
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,750
Oh, there it is!

29
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,250
That must've hurt.

30
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,950
Come on, stupid.

31
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,450
Enough, it's not a surgery.

32
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,450
What are you, a doctor?

33
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,350
Wait, don't move your finger.
What are you doing?

34
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,450
This is driving me crazy.

35
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,050
Where the heck has he gone?

36
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,550
It's a golf course.

37
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,050
Right. It's a golf course.

38
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,150
But you don't remember
why we came, do you?

39
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,450
Yay!

40
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,350
Twelve of them!

41
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,750
What does she see in you anyway?

42
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,550
Your mom?

43
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,150
Right, mom...

44
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,850
The car... Vroom.

45
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,150
Crash!

46
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,050
My blood!

47
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,850
This is revenge.

48
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,750
Right, we're here for revenge.

49
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,950
Anyway,

50
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,650
Where the fuck are
these Benz assholes?

51
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,650
They should have passed by now.

52
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,850
Wow, look!

53
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,050
What're you gonna do
with all those golf balls?

54
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,850
I'll give it to a girl.

55
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,650
You got someone to give it to?

56
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,250
Uh... Yeah.

57
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,050
You ever slept with a woman?

58
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,250
Idiot...

59
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,450
You with your pretty face.

60
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,150
I slept with a woman.

61
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,650
What woman?

62
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,950
Mom.

63
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,950
Where the fuck are they...

64
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,550
Come on!

65
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:30,850
They're here!

66
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,950
Revenge! Revenge!

67
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,050
What's that idiot doing?

68
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,750
What's with him?

69
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,250
Fucking assholes!

70
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,450
Stop the car! You!

71
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,650
What are you doing?

72
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,250
Who do you think you are?
What is this?

73
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,950
You shitheads!

74
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:28,750
Who was driving the car?
You hit-and-run bastards!

75
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,550
Who was driving? You?

76
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,050
What is this?

77
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,350
- What's gotten into you?
- Who was it?

78
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,950
Were you the one driving?

79
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,850
Excuse me.

80
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,950
This person is
too important to be here...

81
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,750
As I was saying, settlement
would be better for both of you.

82
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,350
After all, respected professors
such as yourselves

83
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,050
being involved in a hit-and-run...

84
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,750
And these two aren't
some kind of hustlers.

85
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,250
They're just local kids.

86
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,350
So we're going to settle, okay?

87
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,350
The hit-and-run and the assault

88
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,450
cancel each other out.

89
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,350
<i>Do-joon</i>
The verbal threats don't factor in.

90
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,450
Dean Kwon, the car...

91
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,450
They smashed my rearview mirror
in the parking lot.

92
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,550
A Mercedes Benz 280.

93
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,150
Aw fuck, why the hell
did you smash their mirror?

94
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,850
That'll cost a lot.

95
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,550
You bet.

96
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,950
Damn... Why did I do that?

97
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:14,650
You know how much that cost,
you dumb retard?

98
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,550
Retard?

99
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,750
What are you doing?

100
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,450
Let go! Let me go!

101
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,750
That bastard,
who does he think he is?

102
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:30,950
Sit down, Mister.

103
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,550
The mirror on a Benz...
That would cost...

104
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,850
A lot.

105
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,150
$1500? $2000?

106
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,050
Ah, here she comes...

107
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,850
Good afternoon, sir.

108
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,250
Eat up.

109
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,650
Eat.

110
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:13,850
Always eat well after
coming back from the police station.

111
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,750
Fuck...

112
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,350
I can feed myself.

113
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,650
I boiled this
with deodeok root and gugija.

114
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,750
It's good for your virility.

115
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,550
Really? My virility?

116
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,650
Why are you
so concerned about that?

117
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,650
Women.

118
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,750
Are you seeing someone?

119
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,550
Sure. Gonna sleep with her.

120
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,850
Sleep with her?

121
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,350
Who is it?

122
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,950
Gonna sleep with a woman.

123
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,950
How could you do that to
that Benz-whatever?

124
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,350
That expensive mirror?

125
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,550
Smash! With my foot.

126
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,150
It was revenge!

127
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,750
Good boy.

128
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,850
But I've got no money.

129
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,550
Where will I dig that up?

130
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,250
Whose yard will I dig it up in?

131
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,450
Why dig it up?
Just borrow it from Jin-tae.

132
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,950
Jin-tae!

133
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,950
Stay away from him.
Rotten kid.

134
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,050
He's from bad seed.

135
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,950
Okay.

136
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,750
Where are you going?

137
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,150
To meet Jin-tae.

138
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,150
You should finish dinner.

139
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,550
Have some medicine then.
You shouldn't skip medicine.

140
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,750
Do-joon, you didn't finish this.

141
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,850
Come home early!

142
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,350
Don't be late.

143
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,950
It doesn't hurt, right?

144
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,950
No, it's fine.

145
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,250
This won't hurt,
and I won't charge you for it.

146
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,550
So can you lend me some money?

147
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,550
How much?

148
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,850
It's really urgent.

149
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,050
And I'll give you medicine
instead of interest.

150
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,950
- Medicine?
- Yes!

151
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,050
To make you pregnant,

152
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,250
guaranteed effective.

153
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,050
Is there such a thing?

154
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,250
It really works.

155
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:56,350
I took some, and then
I got pregnant with Do-joon.

156
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,750
Your son will be
just as good-looking.

157
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,550
Do-joon...

158
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,650
His eyes are a work of art.

159
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,150
Like a deer's.

160
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,750
- Like mine?
- Yeah.

161
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,150
They're just like yours.

162
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,950
They're beautiful.

163
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,850
Anyway,

164
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:20,750
you're looking sexier these days...

165
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,350
- I mean...
- Yeah, whatever.

166
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,050
Why hasn't Jin-tae shown up?

167
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:28,850
He's not?

168
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,850
He should be here by now.

169
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,750
You've been saying that for hours.

170
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,450
Don't mess with me.

171
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:43,450
I just came back
from the police station.

172
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,650
Have some respect.

173
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,850
Jin-tae, where the hell are you?
Hurry up!

174
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:04,050
Go to bed, mom!

175
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,750
I'm staying up late.
I told you to go to sleep.

176
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,650
Good shot!

177
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,550
Hey, wake up.

178
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,250
Wake up!

179
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,450
Do something about him.

180
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,550
Did you have a nice sleep?

181
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,850
Wipe the spit off your face.

182
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,050
Goddamn freak,
piss off and go to hell.

183
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,550
Call your mom and tell her
to come pay the bill!

184
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,750
This is driving me crazy.

185
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,450
Do-joon!

186
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,450
Hey, I told you
to use the backstairs.

187
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,850
- Mina!
- How have you been?

188
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:21,450
Yeah, you wanna
have a drink with me?

189
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,750
Really?

190
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,550
- Turn around and march!
- Call me.

191
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,550
Okay, I'm going.

192
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,650
Shut up
and go do your homework.

193
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,250
That skirt is pretty.

194
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,850
You! Turn around!

195
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,650
Her legs are prettier.

196
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,750
Get your eyes off her!

197
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,750
Get out of here!

198
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,950
<i>BAR MANHATTAN</i>

199
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,950
Please fuck off, okay?

200
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,250
Wait...

201
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,950
To pay for the drinks...

202
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,850
Expensive ones...

203
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,050
Hey!

204
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,750
Hey!

205
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,450
Where are you going?

206
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,850
How about you and me...

207
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,350
have a drink?

208
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,650
With a guy... Don't want to?

209
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,950
You don't like guys?

210
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:24,750
So late...

211
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,950
What was her name, Ah-jung?

212
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,950
It's Moon Ah-Jung.

213
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,150
Seorin Girls' High School,
second year, fourth class.

214
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,250
You called her house?
She has guardians?

215
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,350
There's a grandmother,

216
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,850
but she's a real loon.

217
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,150
Always walking around with
a rice liquor bottle in her fist,

218
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:29,550
making a scene.

219
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,450
So the kid is the guardian.

220
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,850
She takes care of her grandma.

221
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:43,650
Anyway, how long has it been
since we had a murder case?

222
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,350
It's the first since I came here.

223
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,750
Has it been that long?

224
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:54,850
Yep.

225
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,350
The crime scene seems intact.

226
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,650
It is.

227
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,250
Quite a picture, huh?

228
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,850
Cops these days...

229
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,350
You know, CSI and all that on TV.

230
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,550
They all watch it.

231
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,050
The forensics team
is pretty sharp, too.

232
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,250
Anyway,
a rain shower passed earlier.

233
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,750
So things must be
pretty mucked up.

234
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,650
I suppose.

235
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,050
Anyway, it must have been
a blunt object.

236
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,950
A fractured cranium,
lots of blood...

237
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,150
What's with this?

238
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,050
Didn't this come in last week?

239
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,150
God, that smell...

240
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,150
Yeah, well...

241
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,250
This smells like a rotting corpse.

242
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,650
My god!

243
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,850
Look at this if you're not blind.

244
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,350
And the appearance...

245
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,350
People are going to think
they're from China.

246
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,350
Ma'am, these are from China.

247
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,550
Hey!

248
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,650
Give me a break.
Don't even mention China.

249
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,450
Besides, Chinese imports
aren't that bad.

250
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,850
Don't tell me...

251
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,350
You're still giving acupuncture
without a license?

252
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:26,350
No, no way!

253
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,850
My husband is a public official.

254
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,150
You know how much trouble
we'll be in?

255
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,350
Sure, I know.

256
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,050
He'll be promoted soon,

257
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,650
so let's not cause any trouble.

258
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:41,050
Last year, do you know how hard
it was to cover for you?

259
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,850
You think only you will
get in trouble?

260
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,450
It will ruin my family completely.

261
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,650
Listen when someone's
talking to you.

262
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:49,850
Mom!

263
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:59,450
Do-joon! Do-joon!

264
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,850
Mom!

265
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:06,350
Get down!

266
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,450
Oh geez...

267
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,550
She's a good runner.

268
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:57,450
Yoon Do-joon, you're charged with
the murder of Moon Ah-jung.

269
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,850
You have the right to remain silent

270
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,750
but there's no way
you'll be able to afford a lawyer.

271
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,450
There she is.

272
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,950
Not that she can
afford to do anything.

273
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:13,150
Can't you drive, idiot?

274
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,850
Are you hurt anywhere?

275
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,250
Turn your head.
Your head isn't hurt?

276
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,750
Turn your head around.

277
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,950
Why is he...

278
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,950
- A dog?
- Dog...

279
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,050
- A wolf?
- Dog...

280
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,950
It's usually hot here.

281
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:40,050
We're all guys here,
so take that off.

282
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,850
Your pants too, okay?

283
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,250
- Pants?
- Take off your pants, it's okay.

284
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,850
This isn't police torture.

285
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:53,150
I'm taking my pants off too.
It feels good.

286
00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:00,150
Anyway Do-joon,
Have you heard of Sepaktakraw?

287
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:03,350
- You have, right?
- No.

288
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,350
Only likes mainstream sports,
the fucker.

289
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,050
Bite it!

290
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,650
Come here and bite it.

291
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,950
That's right, turn around.

292
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,150
The sin always turns around.

293
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,950
Stand straight. Close your eyes.

294
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,750
Don't move or you'll get hurt.
Bite it hard!

295
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,650
Did you see it?

296
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,150
I bet not.

297
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,750
This is power of Sepaktakraw.

298
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,450
It's one of the basic moves.

299
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:48,150
From now on, if you don't
answer clearly yes or no,

300
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,350
I'll kill you right here.

301
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,850
I'll be watching you.

302
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,850
Do-joon,

303
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,250
what did you do last night?

304
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,650
Hey, spit out the apple.

305
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,050
What did you do?

306
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,650
I had a drink...

307
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,950
Where?

308
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,750
- Manhattan.
- That's right. And then?

309
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,450
I slept at home.

310
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,050
You slept, of course.

311
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,850
But before that, I mean...

312
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,750
At home, no,
after drinking at Manhattan

313
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:24,150
on your way home,
what did you do?

314
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,650
The lady at Manhattan said

315
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,550
you were like a dog in heat.

316
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,150
Her daughter, what's her name?

317
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:34,150
- Mina.
- Right. Mina.

318
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,750
You were hitting on her?

319
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,950
Well, I...

320
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,850
Answer clearly!

321
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,450
I slept at home. With mom.

322
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:50,950
- That's simple.
- You sleep with your mom?

323
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,950
You don't have to answer.

324
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,950
Anyway,
you say you don't remember

325
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,650
but everyone remembers you.

326
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,750
There was a guy who saw you
while feeding his dog.

327
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:12,450
You were following
after Moon Ah-jung.

328
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,350
Heading towards
the scene of the murder.

329
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,750
Isn't that right?

330
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,450
I don't remember...

331
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,950
You wanna
die here right now, punk?

332
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,950
We've got plenty of apples.

333
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,450
- Open your mouth.
- Never mind that.

334
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,550
You know,

335
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,350
we also found something

336
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:38,050
next to the body.

337
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,650
Why didn't you put up
a marker next to the body?

338
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,550
With your name written right on it.

339
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,650
- Don't laugh.
- Do-joon,

340
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,050
Just between us...

341
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,050
Why did you do it?

342
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,950
On personal level,
I'm really curious.

343
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:05,350
So did you want to do it
with Moon Ah-jung?

344
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,950
We need to know why,
then the judge can be lenient.

345
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,150
Maybe we can
do something for you.

346
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,650
He's asking this
for your own benefit.

347
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,350
Do-joon.

348
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,350
To be honest,

349
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,850
you're not the kind of person
to commit murder.

350
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,350
Not everyone
is able to kill someone.

351
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,650
You've never been a bad kid.

352
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,150
I can be bad.

353
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:45,550
Jesus...

354
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:51,250
Right, anyone can commit murder.

355
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,750
It's not like you need a license.

356
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,550
Anyway,
you don't know the motive,

357
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,550
but you killed her, right?

358
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,550
The fact that you killed her,
that's what's important.

359
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,450
He confessed.

360
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:18,150
Anyway, this document contains
all the details of the case, see?

361
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:21,150
Check it over.

362
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:25,050
But you can read, right?

363
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,750
Want me to read it for you?

364
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:27,650
I can read.

365
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:33,550
Sure, anyway, don't just sign it
without reading it.

366
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,250
Check the contents, and sign.

367
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,950
Read it well.

368
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:41,850
Why did you do it!

369
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,450
How could you do that?

370
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,250
They hit you?

371
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,750
The cops beat you, didn't they?

372
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,250
Where did they hit you?

373
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,750
An apple...

374
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,150
Apple

375
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:03,850
Apple

376
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,350
Do-joon,

377
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:18,950
at times like this,
you need to focus your mind.

378
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:22,650
Focus. Take a deep breath.

379
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,150
Do-joon...

380
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,050
Everyone says I killed her.

381
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,850
Breathe like me.

382
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,850
And so...

383
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,350
the sin turns around
a few times

384
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,150
- and comes back to me.
- What are you mumbling about?

385
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:47,350
Did you really sign
that confession?

386
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:51,950
Why? Why? Why?

387
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,650
Even if you really did it,
you have to deny it.

388
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,250
If I killed her, I should admit it.

389
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,550
Did you kill her?

390
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,950
Are you crazy? Of course not.

391
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,750
Then why did you sign it, idiot!

392
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,950
Don't call your son an idiot!

393
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,650
Je-mun,

394
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,350
How could you
of all people do this to him?

395
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,550
You know him,

396
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,750
he couldn't even hurt a water bug.

397
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:39,850
A water bug...

398
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,750
Wipe off your face first.

399
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,450
Je-mun,

400
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:06,850
here's some of the camphor ginseng
you used to take in high school.

401
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:11,850
You said it helped you think clearly.

402
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,850
- Take it.
- Listen.

403
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,750
From early morning,

404
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,550
I'm going to be up dealing

405
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,650
with the Juhwang county
robbery case.

406
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,650
And... that crazy kid JP ran away

407
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,250
from the sanatorium
on Mt. Dogye.

408
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:29,550
I gotta go there and then...

409
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,650
I know, I know
how busy you are, but...

410
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:36,350
What I mean is...

411
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,150
regarding Do-joon,

412
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:50,150
his case is closed, okay?

413
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,350
Do you understand?

414
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:02,650
It's finished, 100%.

415
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:15,850
Bastard,
you sure were having fun.

416
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,750
I left early, you ass.

417
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:27,650
Excuse me, people. Step aside.

418
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,150
What the hell are you doing?

419
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,050
What's inside this thing anyway?

420
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,850
Put it down there.

421
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,450
Turn it over.

422
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,750
What in god's name
are you doing?

423
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,350
Are you kidding me?

424
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,050
Turn the damn thing over.

425
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:20,150
Mister, don't touch it!

426
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:23,150
Actually I'm not a relative,

427
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,150
but I'm close to them.

428
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,350
Sir!

429
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:31,050
If there's a reason
you believe he's not guilty, tell us.

430
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,950
If you read through this here,
you see this golf ball?

431
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,550
The golf ball has
already been reported.

432
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,150
What's this?
'Apple-biting human rights abuses'?

433
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,850
Mister, please read it
before throwing it away.

434
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:49,350
Read it carefully first,
then throw it away.

435
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,150
It's my only son.

436
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,150
Is she crazy?

437
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,950
Why is that woman here?

438
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,050
Who?

439
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,850
Yoon Do-joon's mother...

440
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,550
No...

441
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,650
How the hell could you?

442
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,350
Are you out of your mind?

443
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,650
I'm just...

444
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:53,750
As a member of this community
I wanted to pay my respects.

445
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,750
You came to apologize?
For your son?

446
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,550
Does that make sense?

447
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:11,350
Actually, my son didn't do it.

448
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:18,750
Listen everyone,
regardless what the world may think,

449
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,450
you of all people
must understand!

450
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,850
It wasn't my son!

451
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,350
She's completely insane!

452
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:30,450
Hey bitch!

453
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,650
How could you
bring your ugly face here?

454
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,050
Throw some salt at her!

455
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,650
I just wanted to tell you
that my son is innocent.

456
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,650
Stop it!

457
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,750
What do you mean he's innocent?

458
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,650
It was your son, Yoon Do-joon!

459
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,750
- The murderer!
- Bring back our Ah-jung!

460
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,950
Bring her back to us!

461
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,850
Let's talk civilly!

462
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,350
Bring Ah-jung back to life!

463
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,350
- It's a misunderstanding!
- Misunderstanding my ass!

464
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,050
Let go!

465
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,350
What's there to discuss?

466
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,950
How could she dare?

467
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,250
Shut up you fuckers!

468
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:10,050
What's this god damn racket?
Fucking bitches.

469
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,250
How could you
raise such a rotten son?

470
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,950
That goddamn son of a bitch!

471
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:21,450
Don't curse my son.
I won't stand for it!

472
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,950
Rip that bitch's tongue out!

473
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,850
Don't hate him!

474
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,150
I won't...

475
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,250
This place has the best seafood.

476
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,750
You know everything, don't you?

477
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,550
It's true.

478
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,550
Shall we sit down here?

479
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,550
When I come to a buffet,
I never sit down.

480
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,750
Don't run!

481
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:43,950
I just keep scooping it up
and eating it.

482
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,850
Yes of course,
because you're so busy.

483
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,650
I save time that way.

484
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:53,950
This is the lawyer, Gong Suk-ho.

485
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,950
Say hello to him.

486
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,650
Do-joon,

487
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:02,450
Tuck your shirt in.

488
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:07,150
That side, too.

489
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,650
It looks better this way.

490
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,150
Does it?

491
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:16,250
Are you getting
along well enough here?

492
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,350
Yes,

493
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:20,050
the food is good.

494
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,750
The rice with beans
is better than I thought.

495
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:26,650
Rice with beans?
That's what prisoners eat.

496
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,050
Do-joon!

497
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:34,150
The most important thing is
what you remember that night.

498
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:39,950
However small a detail,
just tell him what you can think of.

499
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,750
You understand?

500
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,650
What you saw, what you heard,

501
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:47,350
even what you smelled,
tell him everything in detail.

502
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:51,150
Anyway, you need to try
really hard to remember.

503
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,450
That's your only task in here.

504
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,650
Isn't that right?

505
00:41:58,950 --> 00:41:59,850
Right.

506
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,850
Yes, do this.

507
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:08,250
Is this some kind of exercise?

508
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:12,650
No, we call it
the Temples of Doom.

509
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,250
From childhood,
whenever he does this

510
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,950
it helped him remember.

511
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,150
- So for memory?
- Yes, for memory.

512
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,550
Yes, it's some kind of,
what do you call it...

513
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,250
acupressure.

514
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,850
Oh, I remember!

515
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,550
What?

516
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,750
I didn't do it.

517
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:34,750
It wasn't me!

518
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:37,950
That's right!
Of course you didn't kill her.

519
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,450
No,

520
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,450
not that.

521
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:46,550
I didn't kick it off, the mirror!

522
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:52,450
On the Benz... Jin-tae...

523
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:56,950
It was Jin-tae who did it.

524
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:01,750
I went whoosh!
And he went crunch!

525
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:04,850
Sir.

526
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,550
Let me explain.

527
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,950
What he is saying is...
It's a long story.

528
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,150
Wait!

529
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,950
I just got an urgent message
from the office.

530
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,750
I need to go.

531
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,450
Then what about us?

532
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:31,650
For a first meeting,
this is enough.

533
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:34,350
- Should I Call you?
- I'll call you.

534
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,750
Then when will you call?

535
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,250
Sir...

536
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:48,950
What?

537
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:53,650
Did he leave?
He doesn't like us, does he?

538
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:54,950
He's a very busy man.

539
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:58,150
The most expensive lawyer
in our county.

540
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,750
Damn, wasn't there
anything else to tell him?

541
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:02,050
I should have said more.

542
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,250
Right, who cares about
the mirror?

543
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:08,450
But, you mean
it was Jin-tae who did it?

544
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,150
I knew it.

545
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,350
That rotten little scoundrel.

546
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,450
That jerk never came
to visit me even once.

547
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:24,050
But Do-joon,

548
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:29,250
that night, didn't you go out
to meet Jin-tae?

549
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:32,450
Then you never met him.

550
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:36,950
And the golf balls,

551
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:41,150
he knew about those, right?

552
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:59,250
Good afternoon.
I've come to see Attorney Gong.

553
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,950
He's not in now.

554
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,750
His car is outside.

555
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:07,550
He's really not here.

556
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,350
He is, isn't he?

557
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:11,550
Oh, Mr. Gong! Excuse me!

558
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,150
Oh, look who's here!

559
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,950
- Sir, I...
- Yes?

560
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,850
- Miss Kim, some green tea!
- What I'd like to say is...

561
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,550
If he's here, why can't I...

562
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,750
Ma'am,
would you prefer coffee?

563
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:27,650
To be honest,
about your case,

564
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:32,850
we are proceeding
slowly and methodically.

565
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:33,950
Here, have some.

566
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:37,550
I understand you feel impatient.

567
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,750
But what can we do?

568
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:41,950
You just need to wait patiently.

569
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:46,950
But we need to open an investigation
on Do-joon's friend, Jin-tae!

570
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,350
Ma'am!

571
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:52,050
Let me be honest with you.

572
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,050
In monetary terms,

573
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:56,350
if this were Seoul,

574
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,350
the fee we're charging

575
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:01,750
wouldn't cover an assault case
involving two broken teeth.

576
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:07,050
You should understand that.

577
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,350
<i>This is Jin-tae's house.</i>

578
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,650
<i>I'm out right now,</i>
<i>so leave me a message.</i>

579
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,750
<i>If you are interested</i>
<i>in fishing equipment or bait</i>

580
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:35,850
<i>You can call me at</i>
<i>010-3154-1406.</i>

581
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:53,350
Son of a bitch.

582
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:03,950
<i>Files on Scientific Investigation</i>

583
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,250
Blood...

584
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:08,850
Stop.

585
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:16,450
I said stop.

586
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,750
Let me look at this first.

587
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,150
Let me take this off first.

588
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:25,050
- Cooperate a little.
- Just a sec.

589
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,850
Okay, okay.

590
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:30,150
There you go.

591
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:34,150
Shit, this is the climax.

592
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:25,750
Spa-ghet-ti!

593
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:29,250
Ti-ra-mi-su!

594
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:32,550
Tsu-na-mi!

595
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:33,650
Mi-ner-al!

596
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:34,750
Al-arm!

597
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:36,750
Arm-a-dil-lo!

598
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,550
Where's Je-mun?

599
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:51,450
- Detective Nam Je-mun.
- What's the problem?

600
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:52,650
Out of my way.

601
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:03,250
Push this.

602
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,850
<i>It's not yours, right?</i>

603
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:08,450
<i>Yes!</i>

604
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:10,750
<i>Do I look pretty?</i>

605
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:11,850
She put way too much on.

606
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:15,650
Isn't that...
the Manhattan lady's daughter?

607
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,850
Is this what you do together?

608
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:26,850
Lucky bastard.

609
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:33,350
Watch this part, here.

610
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:37,850
That's what it is, lipstick?

611
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:40,550
But do you play golf?

612
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:42,450
Me, golf?

613
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:45,950
Those professors
gave it to me when they left.

614
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,550
Excuse me. Sir?

615
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:52,250
Do we really have to call
the forensics team?

616
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,950
Anyone can tell
this is just lipstick.

617
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:00,350
All right,
tell them not to bother.

618
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:24,250
Wait!

619
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:30,750
Take an umbrella.

620
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:11,850
Wait a minute.

621
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:51,150
I went to pick you up
at the station.

622
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:55,650
Please get in.
Attorney Gong wants to see you.

623
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,550
Welcome, ma'am.

624
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:12,650
We started without you.

625
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:14,650
You, wait outside.

626
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,850
Have a seat.

627
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,750
You've had quite a day today.

628
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:26,150
I heard it from the police chief.

629
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:29,650
I feel so sad for you.

630
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,250
It's the first time I've seen
you sitting down.

631
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:38,650
Ah, you have a fine wit.

632
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:41,850
Pass her a drink.

633
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:48,550
Ma'am, do you remember
the 2002 World Cup?

634
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:51,050
The Red Devils,

635
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:52,650
Gus Hiddink!

636
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:57,950
Four years passed in a flash

637
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:01,650
I could still feel
the excitement of 2002.

638
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:04,150
But then suddenly
it was 2006.

639
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,950
The Germany World Cup!

640
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:11,650
Four years
is no time at all, I mean.

641
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,950
I really don't understand
what you're saying.

642
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,350
Regarding Do-joon,

643
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:20,950
let's send him off
for just four years.

644
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:26,050
It'll be a hospital, not a jail,

645
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:29,550
and he won't
have to serve 15 years.

646
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:34,350
Ma'am!

647
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:37,250
We need to think realistically.

648
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:42,550
Four years in a mental institution
for this case is a legal jackpot!

649
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:50,450
Music!

650
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:58,050
Ma'am.
I forgot to introduce you.

651
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:04,250
To my right,
my high school classmate,

652
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:06,750
the president of
Agape Psychiatric Hospital,

653
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:09,450
Doctor Yoon Jong-gu!

654
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:13,650
Hey, wake him up?

655
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,650
And next to me

656
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:19,950
my bar exam classmate,

657
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,650
Attorney Park Jong-pyo!

658
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:25,550
He's handsome.

659
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:27,850
What? Are you holding a protest?

660
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,850
He's smashed
after just a few drinks.

661
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:32,150
Mr. Gong!

662
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:38,050
Look, my son is...

663
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:56,250
Do-joon!

664
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:05,750
Why are you so late?

665
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:12,150
You've been drinking, haven't you?

666
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:14,750
It's so late...

667
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:16,350
Did you eat?

668
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,250
Eat?

669
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:24,850
I was wondering if you ate.

670
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:27,850
Thanks so much for asking.

671
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:31,150
Anyway,
I feel so fucking betrayed.

672
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:32,850
How could you
do this to me, bitch!

673
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:39,450
Jin-tae, I did a terrible thing.

674
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:42,250
Forget that.

675
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,250
Just pay me $5000
as a settlement.

676
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:47,250
In cash.

677
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:51,450
All I have right now...

678
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:53,950
it's not much...

679
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:55,950
Wait...

680
01:02:56,150 --> 01:03:05,550
I've been saving this
to pay back my debt.

681
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:07,350
Take this for now.

682
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:16,850
Okay.

683
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:21,950
Send the rest to my bank account.

684
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:24,050
I'll text you the account number.

685
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:27,350
You know what texting is?

686
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:42,750
Wait. By the way,

687
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:46,550
that dead girl, Moon Ah-jung.

688
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:49,850
Do you know anything about her?

689
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:56,750
Actually there were
rumors about her from way back.

690
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:02,350
It's not nice to talk
this way about the dead,

691
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:07,850
but rumors are rumors.

692
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:11,050
Look,

693
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:14,250
there are only three motives
for murder.

694
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:18,450
Money, passion,
and vengeance.

695
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:21,950
Try to think this through.

696
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:26,050
That poor kid living on the hill,
what kind of money could she have?

697
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:28,750
So it must be

698
01:04:28,850 --> 01:04:33,350
either passion or vengeance.

699
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:36,150
So we need to start

700
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,350
by investigating
the people around her.

701
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:42,750
But those fuckers
on the police force

702
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:45,050
found that golf ball

703
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:47,450
and just close the case?

704
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,950
Exactly.

705
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:53,750
Do-joon is the
obvious scapegoat for them.

706
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:57,950
If it were me,
I'd never investigate like that.

707
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:01,950
Sorry, I didn't know
you thought that way.

708
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:09,250
Of course. Do-joon has been
totally fucked over.

709
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:11,750
I'm his friend after all.

710
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:15,750
Thank you, Jin-tae.

711
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:20,250
Don't cry!
This is no time to cry.

712
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:22,550
Quit it!

713
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:31,750
Anyway,

714
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:37,050
Do you know
what the strangest thing is?

715
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:43,850
The roof.

716
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:50,150
The body was left on the roof.
That dead girl.

717
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:54,250
Usually you bury a dead body.

718
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:57,150
But in this case,
it was hoisted up.

719
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:02,150
Her body was
practically put out on display.

720
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:04,750
Like hanging out laundry.

721
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:10,050
'Look, everyone,

722
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:14,550
I murdered this fucking bitch.

723
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:17,150
Do you see the corpse? '

724
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:22,250
That sort of thing...

725
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:56,550
Look.

726
01:06:57,350 --> 01:07:01,250
If you put the body there,
the whole town can see it.

727
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:04,950
Anyway this neighborhood
is pretty strange.

728
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:06,850
So my point is...

729
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:09,750
Don't trust anyone.

730
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:12,150
You don't need them.

731
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:14,350
Don't even trust me.

732
01:07:16,850 --> 01:07:19,250
You go out and find the real killer.

733
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:41,350
Do-joon,

734
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:45,650
you're trying hard to remember
that night, right?

735
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:53,850
If you recall
or remember something,

736
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:56,550
be sure to tell just me.

737
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:01,050
Only to me.
Do you understand?

738
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:04,550
What about that lawyer?

739
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,750
I fired him.

740
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:17,750
You printed the memorial photo
for Moon Ah-jung, right?

741
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:27,150
She's a real pretty girl.

742
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:29,850
That's why
'pretty girls have no luck.'

743
01:08:29,950 --> 01:08:31,450
Isn't it 'pretty girls die young? '

744
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:34,150
That's why she left us early.

745
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,750
That girl, her mother died early

746
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:39,250
and her father ran off
with another woman.

747
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:41,550
Her relatives are
a bunch of bitches too.

748
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:44,250
That young thing got
by all on her own.

749
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:46,250
She must have been
lonely as hell.

750
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:47,250
Who're you talking about?

751
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:50,050
Ah-jung.
They say she had a boyfriend.

752
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:51,150
Who?

753
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:52,450
Crazy JP.

754
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:53,950
Crazy JP from the sanatorium?

755
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:56,150
No fucking way.

756
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:58,450
Crazy JP is ugly as hell.

757
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:02,250
It's true.
Ah-jung really liked boys.

758
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:03,650
They say she couldn't
even take a nap by herself.

759
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:05,650
Those are all lies.

760
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,850
Ah-jung's nickname
was Rice Cake Girl.

761
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:10,050
Rice Cake?

762
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:11,850
Did she eat lots of rice cake?

763
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:13,450
I bet she ate fish cake too.

764
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:18,650
Isn't there anything else
you kids remember about her?

765
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:22,350
I remember
seeing her from the back.

766
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:25,350
She wore a backpack.

767
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:27,150
White calves.

768
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:30,750
Are you sure she was alone?

769
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:32,150
There was nobody else?

770
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:42,150
From Manhattan up to that place,

771
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:45,050
you saw no one else?

772
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:46,950
You see him?

773
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:51,150
Go over and call him retard.

774
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:52,250
And then what?

775
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:56,250
It's fucking hilarious.

776
01:09:58,550 --> 01:09:59,950
You gotta try it.

777
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:02,650
You guarantee me
this will be funny?

778
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:04,350
Just try.

779
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:09,450
Retard!

780
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:19,450
Hey retard!

781
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:27,650
What the fuck,
I feel like an idiot.

782
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:30,850
Here he comes!

783
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:33,850
How could you do that?

784
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:35,250
Why would you fight...

785
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:37,750
I told you to meditate.

786
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:39,950
That's what I was doing.
Shoot...

787
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:42,750
Quiet down.

788
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:44,750
You don't know anything, mom.

789
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:47,450
Sure, your mom
doesn't know anything.

790
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:48,850
What would I know?

791
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:52,050
Why don't you just keep quiet?

792
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:57,550
You told me if anyone insults me,
I should kick their ass.

793
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:00,250
Sure, if they insult you...

794
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:01,250
Kick their ass.

795
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:02,350
If they hit you once...

796
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:05,050
Hit back twice.

797
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:08,950
What about your poor body?

798
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:10,750
Did you take your medicine?

799
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,850
Did they give you some?

800
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:15,650
But you know,

801
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:19,350
it's amazing.

802
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:20,650
What?

803
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:25,850
After I got beaten, I remembered.

804
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,750
The memories came back.

805
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:30,550
You remembered something?

806
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:39,850
Something important.

807
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:41,250
Then what is it?

808
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:45,050
That you tried to kill me.

809
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:51,750
When I was five, right?

810
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:58,350
You gave me a Bacchus bottle
with insecticide in it.

811
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:09,250
Do-joon!

812
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:11,350
Are you okay?

813
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:13,750
Shit, this is embarrassing.

814
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:14,850
What?

815
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:16,850
There are lots of people here.

816
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:19,550
How could you remember?

817
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:21,750
It's true.

818
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:24,550
You tried to get rid of me.

819
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:25,950
How could you say that?

820
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:29,550
I was so desperate...
I was going to kill both of us.

821
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:31,750
But you made me drink it first.
The insecticide drink.

822
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:33,550
Will you shut up?

823
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:39,950
You had to be first,
so that I could follow.

824
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:41,650
Let's step outside.

825
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:45,550
I was so desperate then.

826
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:47,250
You and me are one.

827
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:49,650
We've only got each other.

828
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:51,850
Hey, get over here quick!

829
01:12:53,150 --> 01:12:55,850
How could a five-year-old
remember something like that?

830
01:12:57,150 --> 01:12:59,250
Ma'am, please stop this.

831
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:01,150
Let me give you acupuncture.

832
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:05,150
There's a meridian point

833
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,750
that can loosen the knots
in your heart

834
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:10,150
and clear all horrible memories
from your mind.

835
01:13:11,450 --> 01:13:12,750
Let me see your thigh.

836
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:15,350
I'm the only one
who knows this point.

837
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:19,550
Up your thigh to the partition.
5 inches from here and 31/2 again.

838
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:21,250
Ma'am!

839
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:25,450
Jong-do,

840
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:28,450
you can see that he's sick inside.

841
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:31,150
Please let me do it.

842
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:33,150
Why,

843
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:37,950
this time you gonna kill me
with your needles?

844
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:43,150
What are you doing?
Hurry up and get him out!

845
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:49,150
Don't ever come again, mom.

846
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:51,250
I won't see you.

847
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:24,650
Can you enlarge it
and print it out clearly?

848
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:37,650
I should've
used Gramoxon back then.

849
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:42,650
If I had, we'd be frolicking
in heaven's flower garden right now,

850
01:15:42,950 --> 01:15:44,550
instead of suffering.

851
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:47,850
I didn't have the heart,
so I used Lone Star.

852
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:49,350
That's a weaker brand.

853
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:53,950
So instead of dying, we spent
two days vomiting and shitting water.

854
01:15:56,050 --> 01:16:00,950
After that, I fed him
all the good stuff in the world...

855
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:07,050
He was the cutest then.

856
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:09,250
Though he's still cute now.

857
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:14,650
Yeah, in this photo
he's cute as a button.

858
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:17,150
It makes you want to
have a baby, huh?

859
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:18,450
Yeah.

860
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:21,750
You will soon. You're taking
the medicine I gave you?

861
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:23,050
Sure.

862
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:25,550
This thing is amazing.

863
01:16:27,050 --> 01:16:29,850
There's nothing
you can't do these days.

864
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:33,450
This is nothing, just the basics.

865
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:39,350
Just the basics...

866
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:46,550
This works great.
It's completely gone.

867
01:16:46,650 --> 01:16:48,150
This is nothing, just the basics.

868
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:50,250
It came out well.

869
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:51,850
Do you like it?

870
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:54,850
I wish this would work in the mirror.

871
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:57,750
By the way,

872
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:01,050
how much would it cost

873
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:05,350
to print about
twenty cell phone pictures?

874
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:07,250
Not sure.

875
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:10,350
But why would you
want to print those anyway?

876
01:17:10,450 --> 01:17:12,650
The quality won't be very good.

877
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:15,750
Well,

878
01:17:16,450 --> 01:17:18,050
it's just a memento.

879
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:27,150
Shit.

880
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:29,250
Here's a tissue.

881
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:36,050
This happens
to you like every day.

882
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,550
Why don't you go see a doctor?

883
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:41,750
It's too expensive.

884
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:44,050
Right,

885
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:47,750
the one with the nosebleed
was Ah-Jung.

886
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:50,250
But why cell phone photos?

887
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:53,150
The photos...

888
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:57,250
are pretty awesome.

889
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:59,250
Ma'am,

890
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:04,150
You've got plenty of rice,
and the water works.

891
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:08,550
And you have rice liquor, I see.
Do you have a cell phone?

892
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,450
Why? You wanna buy me one?

893
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:15,350
Or even better,
just give me the money.

894
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:17,950
Your land line is dead,
that's why.

895
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:20,750
Who knows, ask Ah-jung.

896
01:18:20,850 --> 01:18:24,150
That bitch left home
and hasn't come back.

897
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:16,750
Wow, the poop is spinning.

898
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:20,850
Where can I get that done?

899
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:23,350
I made it myself.

900
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:25,050
Really?

901
01:19:25,150 --> 01:19:29,550
I like that kind of thing too.
I want one. Like this.

902
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,950
That model is kind of too old.

903
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:38,350
She's really good at that.
She makes pervert phones too.

904
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:40,950
- If you pay her.
- Shut up.

905
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:44,150
Earn lots of cash, bye.

906
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:46,250
What's a pervert phone?

907
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:52,050
When cellphones take pictures,
they always make a sound.

908
01:19:52,150 --> 01:19:54,150
Cheese, ding!

909
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:56,250
I just tweak it
to remove the sound.

910
01:19:56,350 --> 01:19:57,950
For hidden cameras.

911
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:01,750
I'd like that
even more than the poop.

912
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:08,550
You're a master.
Where did you learn all this?

913
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:13,150
It's just a hobby
and part-time job.

914
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:24,950
Did you do this for
that poor girl Ah-jung?

915
01:20:27,850 --> 01:20:30,350
You know where
her cell phone is, don't you?

916
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:31,650
Ma'am.

917
01:20:34,150 --> 01:20:37,350
Do you have it?

918
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:38,650
What?

919
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:41,650
A menstrual pad.

920
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:45,750
I haven't used one in ages.

921
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:50,050
There's a store across the street.

922
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:52,350
Could you go buy me some?

923
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:55,050
I'm so sorry.

924
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:57,950
Why'd this happen all of a sudden?
It's not time yet.

925
01:21:01,450 --> 01:21:04,750
Don't go anywhere, okay?

926
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:33,350
- I know you have it, bitch.
- I don't.

927
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:37,850
Hey! If we find it on you,
you're dead meat.

928
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:39,550
Fuck, I'm gonna search you.

929
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:41,950
Look in her bag.

930
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:44,650
If we find it,
we're gonna rip your head off.

931
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:47,650
I know you have it bitch.
Where did you stash it?

932
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:49,250
I really don't have it.

933
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:53,650
You were the only friend she had.

934
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:54,950
Tell me now.

935
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:58,850
We're busy guys, okay?

936
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:01,950
So answer us
before we get mean.

937
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:04,650
I don't know, assholes!

938
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:08,450
Cute.

939
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:12,850
You know,
your face looks unbalanced.

940
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:16,650
You can use a little symmetry,

941
01:22:17,050 --> 01:22:18,050
couldn't you?

942
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:20,850
Spilling blood over
a stupid cell phone.

943
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:23,850
Where's Ah-jung's phone,
you fucking bitch!

944
01:22:23,950 --> 01:22:24,950
Tell us, you slut!

945
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:35,750
Who's this fooling around
in my workplace?

946
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:38,450
What the fuck are you doing here?

947
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:40,550
I said what are you doing, fuckers!

948
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:43,350
Answer me! Get out of here!

949
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:45,650
Hey, push me.

950
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:48,350
Stop! Stop!

951
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:55,050
If I see you back here,
you're dead!

952
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:01,250
Yeah, so where are you now?

953
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:04,750
I need your help.

954
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:07,350
Can you come over here now?

955
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:10,650
Yeah, now.

956
01:23:56,850 --> 01:23:59,650
Who are these little shits?

957
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:00,950
Let go of me.

958
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:03,050
And who the fuck are you?

959
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:05,750
You in your stupid fucking hat?

960
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:06,950
You shithead.

961
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:10,150
Why are you looking for
Ah-jung's cell phone?

962
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:23,950
Were you one of
her boyfriends, too?

963
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:33,650
Rice Cake Girl, for sure.

964
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:34,750
Rice Cake?

965
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:37,350
Don't you know that?

966
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:39,850
Give her rice and fuck her.

967
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:43,250
Have your cake,
and eat it, too.

968
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:47,150
Ah-jung, you poor thing...

969
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:48,450
I know things are hard, but still...

970
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:51,850
How could you
take rice instead of cash?

971
01:24:51,950 --> 01:24:55,750
Fuck! If the Schoolgirl Pussy
for Money Union finds out,

972
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:57,150
I'll get expelled!

973
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:58,550
If you take rice one more time,
you're dead.

974
01:24:58,650 --> 01:25:02,050
Cut it Out, dude. Fuck it all.

975
01:25:02,150 --> 01:25:04,650
You're the bastard
who paid her in rice!

976
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:07,250
Get out! That was crazy JP
who stole rice

977
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:09,150
- from the sanatorium.
- Fuck off, asshole!

978
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:10,750
It's true!

979
01:25:10,850 --> 01:25:13,850
Pretty Ah-jung had
turned all cold,

980
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:16,150
and you kept insisting.

981
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,950
Ma'am, listen to this.

982
01:25:32,850 --> 01:25:34,450
It's in my blood.

983
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:37,150
I should have been a fuckin' cop.

984
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:40,750
Moon Ah-jung's cell-phone...

985
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:46,750
If those pictures ever get out,
lots of guys will suffer.

986
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:51,950
That phone is an atomic bomb.

987
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:56,650
She photographed them all
with her pervert phone,

988
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:58,750
those guys she fucked.

989
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:01,550
It must be
two soccer teams or more.

990
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:04,650
So,

991
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:06,450
were you on the soccer team too?

992
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:09,350
How could you say that?

993
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:13,650
But I was actually
quite close to her,

994
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:14,950
in a spiritual way.

995
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:19,050
Back then I asked her.

996
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:20,750
Hey Ah-jung,

997
01:26:21,550 --> 01:26:24,550
did you really take pictures
of all those guys?

998
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:28,550
Sure I did.

999
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:30,550
Hey, am I in there too?

1000
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:34,250
Why? Are you scared?

1001
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:37,850
You think I'll blackmail you?

1002
01:26:38,550 --> 01:26:42,150
Give me a break.
Me scared of you?

1003
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:46,750
I'm sick of it...

1004
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:50,150
What?

1005
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:52,150
Sick of cocks?

1006
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:57,550
I hate all this.

1007
01:26:59,950 --> 01:27:02,350
I should throw
this damn phone away.

1008
01:27:04,150 --> 01:27:06,950
A perfectly good phone?

1009
01:27:07,950 --> 01:27:10,450
Just delete the photos!

1010
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:15,150
I don't want to.

1011
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:26,950
I'm sure
he's there among the photos.

1012
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:28,750
The guy who killed her.

1013
01:27:30,450 --> 01:27:32,550
But that idiot Yoon Do-joon

1014
01:27:32,650 --> 01:27:34,350
<i>sure got fucked over.</i>

1015
01:27:38,150 --> 01:27:40,050
Yeah, that retard

1016
01:27:40,150 --> 01:27:43,750
never even saw her panties,
and then he gets blamed.

1017
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:45,750
That's enough.

1018
01:27:45,850 --> 01:27:48,350
Hey, I heard that
Do-joon sleeps with his mom?

1019
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:49,350
I said shut up!

1020
01:27:49,450 --> 01:27:52,550
Does he just sleep?
Or does he fuck her?

1021
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:23,250
What the hell?

1022
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:26,450
Who are you?

1023
01:28:33,050 --> 01:28:35,550
Wait, don't move.

1024
01:28:51,150 --> 01:28:52,250
Tell me.

1025
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:57,050
Is that really all you know
about the cell phone?

1026
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:01,550
Not again...

1027
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:07,450
Why don't you all leave me alone
for Christ's sake!

1028
01:29:12,050 --> 01:29:13,650
Well...

1029
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:19,950
I remember
her saying something...

1030
01:29:20,050 --> 01:29:21,650
Like...

1031
01:29:22,450 --> 01:29:26,150
If I traded this cell phone
for rice liquor,

1032
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:27,950
how many bottles would I get?

1033
01:29:28,950 --> 01:29:30,750
What, are you drinking
rice liquor now too?

1034
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:06,050
Mom!

1035
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:08,250
Mom! Visit!

1036
01:30:09,050 --> 01:30:12,350
Mom! Visit!

1037
01:30:12,650 --> 01:30:14,450
I remember! I remember!

1038
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:17,650
Mom! Call mom!

1039
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:20,350
Mom!

1040
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:22,850
Granny!

1041
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:29,550
Are you home?

1042
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:36,950
Granny!

1043
01:30:58,750 --> 01:30:59,950
Granny!

1044
01:31:05,350 --> 01:31:07,250
Ah-jung sent you!

1045
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:13,950
The money?

1046
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:31,750
Is that it?

1047
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:34,350
Is that all she sent?

1048
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:40,150
By the way,
where's Ah-jung's cell phone?

1049
01:31:41,650 --> 01:31:42,650
The phone?

1050
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:51,350
I already traded it for rice liquor.

1051
01:31:53,350 --> 01:31:55,250
You're lying.

1052
01:31:56,850 --> 01:32:00,450
Ah-jung told me
to be sure to bring it back.

1053
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:05,750
That crazy tramp
keeps taking it back.

1054
01:33:15,650 --> 01:33:17,050
Look closely.

1055
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:23,750
No, no...

1056
01:33:27,050 --> 01:33:28,550
He had white hair,

1057
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:30,950
an old man.

1058
01:33:55,650 --> 01:33:57,950
I've seen this man before.

1059
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:05,950
Hello?

1060
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:49,650
Is anyone home?

1061
01:35:57,350 --> 01:35:58,550
Who are you?

1062
01:35:59,550 --> 01:36:01,150
Do you see me?

1063
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:04,450
Have a seat.

1064
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:08,550
But why have you come
to a place like this?

1065
01:36:08,650 --> 01:36:13,850
I'm from a volunteer organization
called Hyeminwon.

1066
01:36:14,550 --> 01:36:18,350
We provide free medical checks
for elderly people living alone.

1067
01:36:18,450 --> 01:36:20,250
For free?

1068
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:24,350
We also provide
free acupuncture...

1069
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:27,050
All sorts of things.

1070
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:30,650
I've heard of them, Hyeminwon.

1071
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:33,750
Since you're here,
let's have a chat.

1072
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:37,250
It's cold.

1073
01:36:42,850 --> 01:36:44,350
I've seen you before.

1074
01:36:44,850 --> 01:36:46,150
I don't think so.

1075
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:49,750
Maybe not.

1076
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:52,750
Anyway stay awhile
now that you're here.

1077
01:36:53,450 --> 01:36:57,950
- You can sleep over if you want.
- You're quite a joker.

1078
01:36:58,050 --> 01:37:00,850
Are you sick anywhere?

1079
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:03,650
No place in particular.

1080
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:06,750
But my heart's
not so good these days.

1081
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:09,350
Your heart?

1082
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:14,350
Actually not long ago,
I saw something I shouldn't have.

1083
01:37:14,450 --> 01:37:17,350
At my age it was a shock.

1084
01:37:17,650 --> 01:37:20,350
I felt it in my whole body.

1085
01:37:20,450 --> 01:37:21,950
It's good that I came.

1086
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:23,450
There's a meridian point

1087
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:26,550
that can loosen the knots
in your heart

1088
01:37:26,650 --> 01:37:30,350
and clear all horrible memories
from your mind.

1089
01:37:30,450 --> 01:37:31,550
On the thigh...

1090
01:37:31,950 --> 01:37:34,850
Oh, should I take off my pants?

1091
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:38,450
Just a minute.
I need to prepare first.

1092
01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:42,150
Anyway,

1093
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:45,850
what did you see,
a traffic accident?

1094
01:37:47,350 --> 01:37:49,450
You're curious, aren't you?

1095
01:37:50,150 --> 01:37:56,350
I haven't told a soul about this.

1096
01:37:57,150 --> 01:38:00,750
Tell me.
I'll make sure it doesn't hurt.

1097
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:05,350
You remember that incident
in this town a while back?

1098
01:38:05,650 --> 01:38:07,150
The murder case.

1099
01:38:08,450 --> 01:38:11,450
When that young girl was killed.

1100
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:17,350
The house where it took place
had been abandoned for a long time.

1101
01:38:19,150 --> 01:38:23,850
I happened to be there that night.

1102
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:31,150
Careful, it's hot.

1103
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:37,250
Actually, I sometimes go there.

1104
01:38:37,850 --> 01:38:40,350
It's quiet there,
being empty and all.

1105
01:38:42,650 --> 01:38:46,750
But that night, that girl came in.

1106
01:38:48,850 --> 01:38:50,950
And behind her,

1107
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:54,050
some strange guy
was following her...

1108
01:38:54,150 --> 01:38:56,850
You don't like guys?

1109
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:07,750
You don't like guys?

1110
01:39:30,350 --> 01:39:31,350
Hey!

1111
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:36,650
Do you know me?

1112
01:39:37,950 --> 01:39:39,150
No...

1113
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:41,350
I said, do you know me?

1114
01:39:44,150 --> 01:39:45,150
Nope.

1115
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:46,450
Then why...

1116
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:50,850
I hate guys.

1117
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:57,050
So don't talk to me like that,
you stupid retard.

1118
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:05,550
Shit!

1119
01:41:12,350 --> 01:41:13,350
Hey!

1120
01:41:16,150 --> 01:41:17,950
Why are you lying there?

1121
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:35,750
Hey! Are you hurt?

1122
01:41:35,850 --> 01:41:36,850
No!

1123
01:41:36,950 --> 01:41:39,050
You must have seen it wrong!

1124
01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:40,650
What's gotten into you?

1125
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:42,850
You must have seen it wrong.

1126
01:41:42,950 --> 01:41:46,650
They say Yoon Do-joon is innocent,
that he'll be released soon.

1127
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:48,550
They're going to
re-open the investigation.

1128
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:49,750
Really?

1129
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:53,550
That's what the cops said.

1130
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:55,250
That's nonsense!

1131
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:58,150
I saw his face with my own eyes.

1132
01:41:58,650 --> 01:42:00,950
It was him for sure!
Yoon Do-joon.

1133
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:03,250
He threw that rock

1134
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:08,850
and he made
these weird movements.

1135
01:42:10,350 --> 01:42:13,150
How could they let him out now?

1136
01:42:13,450 --> 01:42:17,050
Anyway they caught the right guy.

1137
01:42:17,650 --> 01:42:21,250
I better call and report it myself.
Those idiots...

1138
01:42:25,550 --> 01:42:27,750
Where's the number?

1139
01:42:34,550 --> 01:42:35,750
No!

1140
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:41,750
Never, no! No!

1141
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:45,450
No way, you trash!

1142
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:56,650
You're not even worth
the dirt on my son's toenail.

1143
01:43:33,650 --> 01:43:38,750
What do I do?

1144
01:43:38,850 --> 01:43:41,150
What do I do? Mom...

1145
01:51:35,150 --> 01:51:36,150
Ma'am!

1146
01:51:37,750 --> 01:51:39,150
We caught the killer.

1147
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:44,550
Do you remember?

1148
01:51:45,050 --> 01:51:47,450
I think I mentioned it before.

1149
01:51:48,550 --> 01:51:50,950
JP, who ran away
from the sanatorium.

1150
01:51:51,450 --> 01:51:54,650
He was... Where was it?

1151
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:56,550
- Mt. Dogye.
- That's right.

1152
01:51:56,650 --> 01:51:57,650
They caught him there.

1153
01:51:57,750 --> 01:52:00,350
Anyway, on his shirt,

1154
01:52:00,450 --> 01:52:03,550
they found some bloodstains.

1155
01:52:03,650 --> 01:52:07,350
They analyzed it
and it matched with Moon Ah-jung,

1156
01:52:07,450 --> 01:52:09,350
so it's game over.

1157
01:52:09,450 --> 01:52:13,250
A golf ball can't
compare to evidence like that.

1158
01:52:13,650 --> 01:52:18,050
Why did he do it?

1159
01:52:19,550 --> 01:52:22,450
Well, he's not
what you call normal.

1160
01:52:23,050 --> 01:52:27,550
It could have ended
in attempted rape, don't you think?

1161
01:52:27,650 --> 01:52:31,850
Sure. But according to him,

1162
01:52:32,250 --> 01:52:35,550
it was all because of love.

1163
01:52:35,650 --> 01:52:37,650
He says he's Ah-jung's boyfriend.

1164
01:52:38,450 --> 01:52:40,550
And the bloodstains,

1165
01:52:40,650 --> 01:52:44,050
he says the two of them
were going at it passionately

1166
01:52:44,150 --> 01:52:48,050
and then she got a nosebleed.

1167
01:52:48,150 --> 01:52:54,050
Wow, that kid
can think pretty fast.

1168
01:52:55,650 --> 01:52:56,850
But ma'am,

1169
01:52:57,650 --> 01:52:59,950
Do you really
need to go and see JP?

1170
01:53:33,850 --> 01:53:37,150
Do you have parents?

1171
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:49,350
Have you got a mom?

1172
01:54:11,950 --> 01:54:13,350
Don't cry.

1173
01:54:17,950 --> 01:54:18,950
Ma'am

1174
01:55:13,250 --> 01:55:14,550
Yoon Do-joon!

1175
01:55:20,350 --> 01:55:28,950
<i>Happy release from jail.</i>
<i>Happy release from jail.</i>

1176
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:35,250
<i>Happy being proven innocent,</i>

1177
01:55:36,450 --> 01:55:41,250
<i>happy release from jail.</i>

1178
01:55:41,550 --> 01:55:43,550
Snap the picture.

1179
01:55:43,950 --> 01:55:44,950
Blow!

1180
01:55:46,450 --> 01:55:48,550
Ready, one, two,

1181
01:55:51,650 --> 01:55:53,950
- Congratulations!
- Here too.

1182
01:55:55,850 --> 01:55:57,650
When did you get this car?

1183
01:55:57,750 --> 01:55:59,550
I received some money recently.

1184
01:55:59,650 --> 01:56:01,850
Cool, huh? I ride it every day.

1185
01:56:02,850 --> 01:56:04,250
Does the tofu taste good?

1186
01:56:04,850 --> 01:56:05,950
Yeah.

1187
01:56:08,850 --> 01:56:11,450
What...

1188
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:13,150
You didn't hear?

1189
01:56:13,450 --> 01:56:16,150
The junk collector's place
burned down.

1190
01:56:16,450 --> 01:56:19,150
They said he died.

1191
01:56:41,550 --> 01:56:43,050
Eat up.

1192
01:56:44,750 --> 01:56:46,450
Have some deodeok root, too.

1193
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:52,550
What happened to the chestnuts?
I put in several.

1194
01:56:57,250 --> 01:56:58,350
Mom.

1195
01:57:00,650 --> 01:57:04,250
I've been... thinking.

1196
01:57:05,850 --> 01:57:07,050
About what?

1197
01:57:09,850 --> 01:57:11,750
That crazy JP,

1198
01:57:13,250 --> 01:57:15,850
why'd he put her body up
on the roof,

1199
01:57:16,450 --> 01:57:17,950
way up high?

1200
01:57:19,250 --> 01:57:21,550
Why think about that?

1201
01:57:28,950 --> 01:57:30,450
So I think,

1202
01:57:32,950 --> 01:57:34,850
maybe it was
so people would see her?

1203
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:40,650
She was bleeding

1204
01:57:40,750 --> 01:57:42,750
she needed to go to the hospital.

1205
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:49,750
So he put her in a place
where people could see her fast.

1206
01:57:54,050 --> 01:57:57,350
I bet that's it.

1207
01:58:35,350 --> 01:58:36,850
<i>Attention, y'all.</i>

1208
01:58:36,950 --> 01:58:42,250
<i>Passengers on the</i>
<i>Thank-You-Parents Bus Tour,</i>

1209
01:58:42,350 --> 01:58:46,650
Mom, take this on the bus to eat.

1210
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:49,150
You didn't have to buy so much.

1211
01:58:49,250 --> 01:58:52,650
You can share it
with the other parents.

1212
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:54,850
Don't leave it behind.

1213
01:58:58,550 --> 01:58:59,550
Oh, I forgot,

1214
01:59:01,050 --> 01:59:03,350
Mom. Here.

1215
01:59:03,450 --> 01:59:04,450
What?

1216
01:59:06,250 --> 01:59:07,450
I have something for you.

1217
01:59:07,550 --> 01:59:08,650
What is it?

1218
01:59:25,450 --> 01:59:31,450
Well... I found this at
the junk collector's burnt house.

1219
01:59:36,550 --> 01:59:41,650
How could you
leave this lying around?

1220
01:59:51,750 --> 01:59:53,150
Mom...

1221
02:00:14,050 --> 02:00:17,250
Hurry up!
