1
00:00:14,425 --> 00:00:18,464
Gentlemen, go back.
We'll do the Economics test.

2
00:00:22,345 --> 00:00:24,939
- El Djebena.
- Good morning.

3
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:30,028
- And the batteries?
- Large ones.

4
00:00:47,826 --> 00:00:49,510
- Mali.
- Sophie.

5
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,223
Am I crazy or do they multiply?

6
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,905
Soon the carpets will come out.

7
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:32,831
We used to control the court.
Good thing they're dumb.

8
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:41,629
If they'd stop thinking with
their balls, they'd evolve more.

9
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,752
You should get closer
to see what's going on.

10
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:48,665
I don't understand.

11
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:51,830
What don't you understand?

12
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:58,829
- Want me to get a beating?
- Why would they beat you?

13
00:01:58,992 --> 00:02:04,908
- Are you crazy? To them I'm a Corsican.
- What? Their eyes are blinded by shit.

14
00:02:16,913 --> 00:02:22,477
Sends some guards to mingle with them.
They will eat from your hand.

15
00:02:24,073 --> 00:02:25,837
Good thinking.

16
00:02:27,554 --> 00:02:30,398
Just another Arab
thinking with his balls.

17
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:08,799
YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE

18
00:03:21,677 --> 00:03:25,682
Let me introduce you to some friends.
The man in Marbella.

19
00:03:26,198 --> 00:03:28,235
- This is Khalid!
-Your brother.

20
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:32,196
This is Mishka!

21
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,155
This is Damien. And here is Olivier.
Say hello to Mali.

22
00:03:36,558 --> 00:03:40,722
- What's your name?
- My name's Fernanda. And I love cocks.

23
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,681
Marbella!

24
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,642
There, in Block C. What are the
Muslims doing? Smuggling? Drugs?

25
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:03,479
- They do their own things.
- Really? You get nothing?

26
00:04:05,881 --> 00:04:11,684
Don't you think it would be nice
to send a pair of strong guys?

27
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:15,646
- Press them a little bit.
- Why press them?

28
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:21,998
Why? To show them who's boss,
which hand they have to kiss.

29
00:04:22,482 --> 00:04:24,007
Isn't it obvious?

30
00:04:25,522 --> 00:04:30,005
Before you were 20. Now you're 5.
Can't you see the difference?

31
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:38,839
- What kind of difference?
- I can't do for 5 what I did for 20.

32
00:04:45,884 --> 00:04:47,807
- No, it's all right.
- What's all right?

33
00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:51,082
- I'll manage. I'll see what...
-You'll manage?

34
00:04:51,604 --> 00:04:56,929
Use your head! Tomorrow you tell
me what you can do for me.

35
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:17,330
We have a problem, brother.

36
00:05:31,847 --> 00:05:36,250
- Make a petition. What can I say?
- Maybe Luciani can do something.

37
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:42,691
I don't understand. I was his lapdog
and now you ask me to lick your ass?

38
00:05:42,728 --> 00:05:45,288
Not for myself, for our brothers.

39
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:50,132
To stop being his slave and be yours?

40
00:05:50,488 --> 00:05:52,525
If you want a favor, learn to ask.

41
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:58,251
- What do you want?
- What could I want here?

42
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:00,849
- Respect.
- Do I look Corsican?

43
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:06,009
-You think they trust you?
- I'll see what I can do.

44
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:26,252
Luciani.

45
00:06:35,371 --> 00:06:41,208
- Now the meetings are here?
- It's cozy, warm, with a sea view.

46
00:06:41,532 --> 00:06:43,250
- Sit down.
- I'm fine here.

47
00:06:44,732 --> 00:06:48,373
- So, what do you want?
- I have a problem in Marseille.

48
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:55,489
A cousin of yours, Brahim Lattrache.
I want you to pass a message.

49
00:06:56,493 --> 00:07:01,010
Tell him Luciani wants to talk
to him face to face, okay?

50
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:07,377
- I'll see. What about the guards?
- I'll take care of that.

51
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:10,891
Brahim Lattrache in Marseille.

52
00:07:17,974 --> 00:07:22,298
See the guy in red? He'll go to the end,
turn around and start again.

53
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:30,689
The 2 that are running...
See the little guy with the hat?

54
00:07:31,136 --> 00:07:32,695
He'll do some push-ups.

55
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:41,053
Check the game.
Look at the hoop.

56
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:48,811
- Missed. Fuck him!
- No, the other.

57
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:58,220
For me you see nothing?

58
00:08:02,578 --> 00:08:04,216
Yes, snow.

59
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:25,019
Ok. I'll move aside.

60
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,421
Fuck you...

61
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,454
Quick, quick!

62
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,295
Ok

63
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,456
Latif, the Egyptian. They let a car
pass and then ambushed Riyad.

64
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,619
He was caught with hash.

65
00:08:46,381 --> 00:08:47,621
Now they want money.

66
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:51,346
Who are those guys?
What do you know?

67
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:57,343
Nothing. I know their boss is called
Latif, the Egyptian. From the south.

68
00:08:57,862 --> 00:09:01,105
They use the same road.
They know the secrets.

69
00:09:03,382 --> 00:09:04,747
What do we do?

70
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:09,346
Give them what they ask.

71
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,139
Boss!

72
00:09:12,222 --> 00:09:16,784
- Any news of his friend? - None.
What should I do? It's been 3 days...

73
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:20,259
Calm down! There are many people
here and we have hash.

74
00:09:20,303 --> 00:09:24,058
If anyone knows the Egyptian
we'll know, don't worry.

75
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,460
And he's going to hurt when I find him!

76
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:30,500
- How are you doing with the beards?
- Getting along.

77
00:09:31,064 --> 00:09:33,783
Talk to them... and investigate.

78
00:09:50,785 --> 00:09:53,106
- I need a favor.
- What is it?

79
00:09:53,145 --> 00:09:57,901
- I need information about someone.
- Who? - A black, Latif, the Egyptian.

80
00:09:57,946 --> 00:10:00,745
Latif? What can I do?

81
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:04,905
- Tell me who he knows here.
- His brother-in-law.

82
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:16,144
- What's the deal?
- Nothing. It's my business.

83
00:10:16,187 --> 00:10:17,087
See him?

84
00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:20,353
The one over there.

85
00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:21,867
With the blue cap.

86
00:10:23,948 --> 00:10:26,792
Are the other 2 with him?

87
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:29,622
- Seems that way.
- Will the Muslims help?

88
00:10:29,748 --> 00:10:35,710
- They give us 2 guys. - No problem.
If we plan well, everything'll be fine.

89
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:05,826
Shut up!

90
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:18,673
Boss! His ankle.
He needs a doctor.

91
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:45,474
Lights!

92
00:12:00,395 --> 00:12:03,035
Mohammed Gaziler?
You know the Egyptian?

93
00:12:03,435 --> 00:12:05,312
-You know him?
-Yes

94
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:06,676
Sit down.

95
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:15,400
Ouassila is your mother?
Is her address on the visitors' list?

96
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:16,798
Look.

97
00:12:19,356 --> 00:12:24,556
If you want to see her alive, tell Latif
I want my friend and my stuff, okay?

98
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:26,121
- Okay?
- Agreed.

99
00:12:26,796 --> 00:12:27,752
Call.

100
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,398
- Where were you?
- At the registrar's office.

101
00:12:40,437 --> 00:12:42,439
Everything Ok?

102
00:12:42,438 --> 00:12:44,952
- Have you eaten?
- I have to see a guy.

103
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,955
It can wait.
Come for coffee.

104
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,672
Help yourself.

105
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:09,595
I want to talk to you. I've seen you in
the yard with this tall guy, the Gypsy.

106
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,715
What's the business?
Hash, pills?

107
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,284
- Hashish.
- A lot?

108
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,161
- Want apart?
- No. It's your business, your business.

109
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,435
- How does it come in?
- The visiting rooms, the kitchens.

110
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:29,884
- So you bought off some guards.
- No. A dealer. Frozen food.

111
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:33,365
- So that's how it works?
- For the moment, yes.

112
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:40,759
What if you get caught?

113
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:45,243
The hole.

114
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:48,045
And no furloughs.

115
00:13:50,603 --> 00:13:56,565
What did I say last time? To be careful.
Not to risk your outings.

116
00:13:57,123 --> 00:14:01,845
What do you do? Fight with some guys.
Lay down your law. What's your game?

117
00:14:02,683 --> 00:14:08,122
You're valuable with furloughs, Djebena.
If not, what good are you?

118
00:14:09,324 --> 00:14:10,224
Get out.

119
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:17,325
Get out!

120
00:14:37,846 --> 00:14:39,086
Bastard!

121
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:46,204
I'll kill you...

122
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:58,930
You don't fear me any more?

123
00:15:03,727 --> 00:15:08,324
If you get around,
it's because I made you a porter.

124
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:15,170
If you eat it's thanks to me. If you
dream, think, live... it's thanks to me.

125
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:20,813
You say you have no guards.
Bullshit!

126
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:28,045
You have Luciani etched on your face!
You live for me, Djebena!

127
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:36,010
They look at you and they see me.
Who else would they see? Can you tell me?

128
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:03,892
Are you here?

129
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,200
Come here.

130
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,656
Enough already.
Come here I said.

131
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,103
I have something fun
to tell you.

132
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,538
You're going to Marseille.

133
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:13,575
Your next leave will be to Marseille.

134
00:18:14,622 --> 00:18:16,784
From Brecourt to Marseille in a day?

135
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:21,937
There is a flight at 9 am
and a return flight at 3.

136
00:18:22,782 --> 00:18:25,058
There you will see Brahim Lattrache.

137
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:28,267
Should I take anything?

138
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,141
No. You talk and listen.

139
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:36,059
Find out the cost of cutting
ties to the Italians.

140
00:18:39,223 --> 00:18:44,582
Tell him I'm interested in negotiating
without Jacky Marciaggi and the others.

141
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:51,943
Sampiero will contact your friend
for payment and expenses.

142
00:18:56,464 --> 00:18:57,909
Have you ever flown?

143
00:19:42,588 --> 00:19:44,704
Good morning, Truette.

144
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:47,422
- Morning, El Djebena.
- Good morning, sir.

145
00:19:47,547 --> 00:19:48,742
Open up, please.

146
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:23,073
- Look at the time, I arrived on time!
- Careful! Don't talk to me like that.

147
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:27,832
- How should I talk? I'm at risk here.
- Okay, okay. I understand.

148
00:20:28,911 --> 00:20:33,235
This car is a piece of shit!
A lure for the police.

149
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:37,507
-You're becoming an idiot.
- Enough is enough. - Why enough?

150
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:41,871
Who made you the boss?
If you want to split, say so.

151
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:45,516
Keep that for Latif's trunk.

152
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:15,393
Get Latif out of your head.

153
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:19,229
I'll find him and I'll finish him.

154
00:21:20,515 --> 00:21:23,997
You won't finish anyone. Wake up.
Business has stopped.

155
00:21:24,195 --> 00:21:27,313
It's nothing personal.
That bastard has blocked everything.

156
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,276
We got back the hash,
but we can't move it.

157
00:21:32,955 --> 00:21:38,200
They even fucked us up in the city.
I swear I'll finish him off.

158
00:21:39,316 --> 00:21:40,317
Fuck them!

159
00:21:42,436 --> 00:21:44,200
You look like a lawyer.

160
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:55,635
Boarding at 9:55,
gate 33, Terminal 2.

161
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,313
Bonvoyage.

162
00:22:14,118 --> 00:22:15,153
Come forward.

163
00:22:16,638 --> 00:22:17,719
Raise your arms.

164
00:24:01,086 --> 00:24:02,611
- Hands!
- Why?

165
00:24:02,846 --> 00:24:03,881
Hands!

166
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,590
Move.

167
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,929
Is this necessary?

168
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:12,406
I'm not worried.

169
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:14,486
What does Lucianiwant?

170
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:18,295
He wants to know your price to quit the
deal with the Italians in the casino.

171
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:23,457
If you agree, he'll guarantee your
position with the slot machines.

172
00:25:24,572 --> 00:25:28,133
How will he guarantee our work?
With his ration card?

173
00:25:29,052 --> 00:25:30,133
No, with the Council.

174
00:25:30,172 --> 00:25:34,291
Sampiero will guarantee your place
with Marcaggi and the Corsican Council.

175
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:42,816
- How long have you known Luciani?
- From prison.

176
00:25:44,893 --> 00:25:46,372
Have you worked for him
all this time?

177
00:25:48,494 --> 00:25:51,850
How was it? Did you arrive
and begin to work?

178
00:25:54,294 --> 00:25:57,298
- Does he protect you?
- No. I work. He doesn't protect me.

179
00:25:57,334 --> 00:26:00,213
-You're his Arab. He protects you.
- No. I work for them.

180
00:26:01,054 --> 00:26:02,055
At what price?

181
00:26:03,935 --> 00:26:07,098
Are you the mole?
Do you send messages?

182
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:09,734
- Do you suck him off?
- What the hell is this?

183
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:17,461
Why does an Arab work for the Corsicans?
Do you belly dance for them?

184
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:22,811
Are you his girl? I had a friend there.
He never came out.

185
00:26:24,176 --> 00:26:27,612
His name was Reyeb.
Sound familiar?

186
00:26:29,177 --> 00:26:30,292
Sound familiar?

187
00:26:32,737 --> 00:26:36,617
Was it Luciani who killed him?
What do you know?

188
00:26:37,337 --> 00:26:38,691
What do you know?

189
00:26:49,137 --> 00:26:51,538
Animals coming!
Watch out!

190
00:27:03,658 --> 00:27:05,740
There! 2 more!

191
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:08,399
Kill it!

192
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:26,818
What are you about?
How did you know this?

193
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,305
What are you? What are you?
A prophet or what?

194
00:27:35,261 --> 00:27:36,706
I killed Reyeb.

195
00:27:41,021 --> 00:27:43,217
Fuck. You've come a long way.

196
00:28:10,824 --> 00:28:13,384
- What's your name?
- Mali. - Mali.

197
00:28:13,784 --> 00:28:19,427
- I'll wash your shirt and pants.
- The pants aren't dirty. -You sure?

198
00:28:19,904 --> 00:28:21,463
Then give me the shirt.

199
00:28:44,346 --> 00:28:49,910
Here's your shirt, son. I washed it,
but the blood stains won't come off.

200
00:28:58,067 --> 00:29:04,029
Hey, prophet! Tell me. The Muslims want
to talk about Luciani. Is that it?

201
00:29:07,068 --> 00:29:10,584
You speak with the Muslims,
the Corsicans, you come here...

202
00:29:11,548 --> 00:29:15,394
You deal with everyone. That's
not good for your balls, you know?

203
00:29:16,949 --> 00:29:18,144
Do you also talk to Lingherri?

204
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:25,623
Looks like someone is spying among the
Corsicans. Does your boss know?

205
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:28,830
-Are you sure?
- Sure.

206
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:33,313
- Do you know him well?
- I think so...

207
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,269
Well, tell this to Luciani.

208
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:42,746
I accept his offer with one condition.
Find the spy and clean the house.

209
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,315
His name is Latif, the Egyptian.
You know him?

210
00:29:55,231 --> 00:29:56,471
What can I do for you?

211
00:29:57,911 --> 00:29:59,788
Can you tell him we know each other?

212
00:30:00,752 --> 00:30:01,992
That we work together?

213
00:30:04,912 --> 00:30:05,812
We work together...

214
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:08,076
You think I can say that?

215
00:30:14,152 --> 00:30:16,473
Let's eat before you go.

216
00:30:18,432 --> 00:30:20,708
- Can I go to the beach?
- Whatever.

217
00:30:59,436 --> 00:31:00,437
Hurry!

218
00:31:04,836 --> 00:31:05,917
Has everything gone well?

219
00:31:14,637 --> 00:31:19,711
-You'll see Latif and talk to him.
- Really? With that asshole?

220
00:31:21,157 --> 00:31:27,119
- Lattrache will talk to him.
- What does he have to do with it?

221
00:31:27,478 --> 00:31:31,199
His problem is the Corsicans and ours,
Latif. We'll help each other.

222
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:38,156
I proposed a deal. Let's be partners. We
share everything. Caches, cars, vendors.

223
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:43,715
-We occupy the market and control it.
- Know what you're asking, brother?

224
00:31:44,838 --> 00:31:49,435
We'll settle all accounts when the time
comes. For now we leave it as it is.

225
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:56,274
I'm sick again.

226
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,320
The test results are not
good. I need more chemo.

227
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,281
Will you be okay?

228
00:32:15,681 --> 00:32:17,206
Take care, brother.

229
00:32:22,962 --> 00:32:26,000
You're 30 minutes late.
You know the rules.

230
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:29,716
- All day working with car doors...
- Spread your legs.

231
00:32:30,962 --> 00:32:34,842
I'll let it go this time, but think
about your probation, moron.

232
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:36,118
Use your watch.

233
00:32:53,164 --> 00:32:56,839
I don't care about Marcaggi's gratitude.

234
00:32:58,084 --> 00:33:02,169
What I want is for him to move
his ass and fix this.

235
00:33:03,724 --> 00:33:09,720
As we speak one of us is sleeping
with the Italians. I want to know who.

236
00:33:10,885 --> 00:33:14,765
- Does he know? -Yes
- So?

237
00:33:15,445 --> 00:33:17,004
He's negotiating with him...

238
00:33:18,286 --> 00:33:22,769
- He thinks of himself.
- Same as Lattrache.

239
00:33:23,446 --> 00:33:26,484
- Do you know who he is?
- No.

240
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:33,320
Wait, Cesar. Jacky wants
you out of this.

241
00:33:33,366 --> 00:33:36,688
Neither on one side nor the other.
Out!

242
00:33:38,847 --> 00:33:43,409
- He says if you need anything...
- Okay, okay. Understood.

243
00:33:49,848 --> 00:33:51,293
I have good news.

244
00:33:52,688 --> 00:33:58,650
About creating a hotel company. I've
found someone. A Basque from Pamplona.

245
00:34:00,688 --> 00:34:04,727
- Why do you say "good news"?
-You asked me to look for someone.

246
00:34:04,768 --> 00:34:07,487
Wait. We are talking about
Jacky, Sardinia, casinos,

247
00:34:08,049 --> 00:34:12,247
You tell me not to interfere and
suddenly you speak of good news.

248
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:15,129
- The ones before were not good?
- Yes.

249
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:19,404
- Why then "good news now"?
- I didn't say "now".

250
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:24,134
- I can tell you 2 good things.
-Yeah? Why did it take you so long?

251
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,365
Thanks, boss.

252
00:34:43,012 --> 00:34:43,968
Pass the papers.

253
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:55,693
-You got the results?
- Which match?

254
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:05,098
Why do you make coffee?

255
00:35:07,813 --> 00:35:09,815
Because you're still a servant?

256
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:15,495
You go out for me, you see Sampiero,
you see Lattrache.

257
00:35:15,974 --> 00:35:20,650
You take care of my business...
The casinos, the Lingherris.

258
00:35:21,814 --> 00:35:24,579
And when I ask for coffee, you make it.

259
00:35:35,615 --> 00:35:39,540
- Don't you have anything to say?
- Which is the question?

260
00:35:40,016 --> 00:35:44,453
Why do I do it, or how I feel?
I do it because you ask me to.

261
00:35:45,416 --> 00:35:48,340
- Want to know how I feel?
- No, no. I'm not interested.

262
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:55,331
- Do you still need me?
- It's you who needs me.

263
00:35:58,577 --> 00:35:59,499
Can I go?

264
00:36:09,618 --> 00:36:13,054
You hear me?
When will I see Latif?

265
00:36:13,978 --> 00:36:18,700
Listen. Give my whole part
to Imam Moussab. All of it.

266
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,622
No idea.
Try the mosque.

267
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:27,217
I want him to know the money
is from Mali El Djebena.

268
00:36:27,499 --> 00:36:29,979
He'll know how to find me.

269
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:33,543
Do as I say. Leave me
a message afterwards.

270
00:37:02,781 --> 00:37:04,624
Move that ass, nigger.

271
00:37:14,862 --> 00:37:16,421
- How you doing?
- Okay.

272
00:38:10,186 --> 00:38:14,862
Is the money at the mosque yours?
Is it dirty money?

273
00:38:15,307 --> 00:38:16,866
Of course it's dirty!

274
00:38:18,187 --> 00:38:21,828
But it's better in his hands
than in mine.

275
00:38:22,227 --> 00:38:23,991
Do you think the Imam will accept it?

276
00:38:25,707 --> 00:38:27,186
It depends on you, friends.

277
00:38:30,148 --> 00:38:35,143
I understand what you do here and I
respect that, but you have no power.

278
00:38:35,628 --> 00:38:37,949
The Corsicans control the guards.

279
00:38:38,828 --> 00:38:42,503
You pray in pigsties, you sleep in
shitty places. You rise...

280
00:38:42,549 --> 00:38:46,907
and they crush you again. Perhaps the
Imam knows how to use that money.

281
00:38:48,669 --> 00:38:49,704
What do you want?

282
00:38:50,949 --> 00:38:53,987
Just like you, Hassan.
A better life for me and my brothers.

283
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:58,628
You think I'm stupid or what?
You just want to use us. That's all.

284
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:02,469
So? As long as it's good for everyone.

285
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,789
Listen. If you ever talk to
the Imam again, you're dead.

286
00:39:11,231 --> 00:39:14,633
You talk money to me.
It's between us, okay?

287
00:39:19,311 --> 00:39:22,793
Is that why you gave him the money?
To talk to me?

288
00:39:25,671 --> 00:39:27,992
- From a killer to a killer?
- Leave that shit.

289
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,386
Just kidding.

290
00:40:04,474 --> 00:40:07,114
Christmas

291
00:40:23,196 --> 00:40:26,279
Handmade. No gifts, no Christmas.

292
00:40:30,356 --> 00:40:34,839
- I am the gift. 100% hand made.
- What a gift!

293
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:38,760
Want some?
Help yourself.

294
00:40:43,477 --> 00:40:45,002
Is it made from wild boar?

295
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:47,712
Are you kidding?

296
00:40:49,357 --> 00:40:51,758
Shall we stop?
Can we talk honestly?

297
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:56,319
Why?

298
00:40:58,558 --> 00:41:02,961
I have to ask you a favor,
but not because you work for me,

299
00:41:04,118 --> 00:41:07,679
but because I trust you.
Do you see the difference?

300
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:11,398
I'm not sure.

301
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,040
I saw Vettori. He has some information.

302
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,159
He knows that I'm dealing
with the Lingherris.

303
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,402
Form a team.
How are your guys?

304
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,401
- A team for what?
- To eliminate them.

305
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,036
- Eliminate the Lingherris?
- The Lingherris and Jacky Marcaggi.

306
00:41:35,681 --> 00:41:38,924
Kill Marcaggi? Is that it?
Kill your boss?

307
00:41:39,281 --> 00:41:44,481
Nobody must know. You, me,
Vettori and nobody else.

308
00:41:45,161 --> 00:41:46,606
It will be in Paris.

309
00:41:47,002 --> 00:41:51,724
Vettori will provide the stuff.
He'll help, but we must remain invisible.

310
00:41:52,362 --> 00:41:53,727
Can you do that for me?

311
00:42:13,284 --> 00:42:15,207
Any plans for when you get out?

312
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:22,805
When we have the casinos,
we'll need someone to manage them.

313
00:42:24,565 --> 00:42:25,760
With Lattrache.

314
00:42:44,486 --> 00:42:47,729
We'll do it. We'll do it.
I only have 6 months.

315
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:51,361
- 6 more months and that's it.
- Maybe they're wrong.

316
00:42:51,686 --> 00:42:54,246
Give me time.
What's the problem?

317
00:42:54,726 --> 00:42:57,240
- Kill those guys?
- Speak softly.

318
00:42:57,606 --> 00:42:59,927
We don't know them.
What do we care?

319
00:43:00,366 --> 00:43:02,243
Think about when you get out.

320
00:43:03,927 --> 00:43:04,962
I won't be here.

321
00:43:05,407 --> 00:43:08,047
You can think of your future, I can't.

322
00:43:08,447 --> 00:43:11,929
Mali... there's Djamila.
There's my son.

323
00:43:11,968 --> 00:43:16,565
- What'll I leave them? A fridge? ATV?
- What are you saying?

324
00:43:17,448 --> 00:43:19,212
You'll take care of them.

325
00:43:22,248 --> 00:43:24,125
That's what I ask you, brother.

326
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:28,284
You'll say we agree.
And we'll do it.

327
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:54,571
I talked to my outside friend.
We'll do it.

328
00:43:54,691 --> 00:43:56,887
He's put together a first class team.

329
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:03,216
I'll talk to my people. Give me the
number. Vettori will call your friend.

330
00:45:04,776 --> 00:45:06,255
Have you tried this?

331
00:45:07,976 --> 00:45:09,375
I'll give you some.

332
00:46:51,023 --> 00:46:54,106
Are you listening? It's bad.

333
00:46:54,183 --> 00:46:57,346
Our guys are good for drugs.
Not for other stuff.

334
00:46:57,784 --> 00:47:01,664
-You were the one who wanted to do it.
What now? - I can't force them.

335
00:47:02,184 --> 00:47:06,826
When the Corsicans took out the
guns they ran away. Like devils.

336
00:47:06,864 --> 00:47:10,186
That bastard Vettori
treats us like shit.

337
00:47:10,305 --> 00:47:13,707
There was a fight on the way.
Now Khalid wants to kill him.

338
00:47:15,865 --> 00:47:18,106
- Find some other guys.
- Now?

339
00:47:18,145 --> 00:47:19,670
- For a contract?
- Who cares?

340
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:23,461
You got a minute.

341
00:47:30,466 --> 00:47:32,582
I lost my time and money
with this group of idiots and...

342
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:35,466
just look at him!

343
00:47:35,867 --> 00:47:38,541
- Be careful what you say.
- I will deliver you from your misery!

344
00:47:38,947 --> 00:47:40,312
- Hands off!
- Calm down!

345
00:47:42,547 --> 00:47:45,027
Hush! We will do it our way.

346
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:47,946
- What?
- I'll try to explain. May I?

347
00:47:50,427 --> 00:47:53,829
- Listen. We'll kill them.
- Promise.

348
00:47:53,868 --> 00:47:57,270
We'll kill them,
but they can't know how.

349
00:47:57,788 --> 00:48:01,031
- I'm going to hit you. Lower you head.
- What?

350
00:48:01,068 --> 00:48:02,866
I'll hit you and you lower your head.

351
00:48:07,189 --> 00:48:10,432
I get it. Can I go on?

352
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:28,429
Pick me up without the others.
You and I will deal with this.

353
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:30,745
Will you be able to do it?

354
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:38,752
Guard!

355
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:42,948
Are you ready to complete your
insertion and rehabilitation project?

356
00:48:43,551 --> 00:48:49,035
- It's a support center for detainees.
- I know Imam Moussab's Center.

357
00:48:50,112 --> 00:48:54,356
You requested 2 days.
It seems excessive.

358
00:48:54,672 --> 00:48:57,186
I propose a practice module of one day.
From 7am to 7 pm.

359
00:48:58,872 --> 00:49:00,749
- Is that all right?
- Yes, very good.

360
00:49:15,073 --> 00:49:20,068
Muhammed, peace be upon him, reached
the top of the mountain and fell asleep.

361
00:49:20,514 --> 00:49:26,237
The angel Gabriel appeared.
Do you know what he said?

362
00:49:26,594 --> 00:49:31,077
He said, "Pray, pray, Muhammed.
Pray to God because He created you."

363
00:49:31,114 --> 00:49:36,188
"He created mankind from scratch.
Pray what He taught in his writings."

364
00:49:38,795 --> 00:49:39,796
Wonderful!

365
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:42,832
Wonderful, brother!

366
00:49:46,036 --> 00:49:48,118
Prayer.

367
00:50:04,517 --> 00:50:05,439
The door.

368
00:50:13,357 --> 00:50:14,257
Have a good day, Djebena.

369
00:50:28,838 --> 00:50:30,397
- What about the others?
- In the back.

370
00:50:58,881 --> 00:51:00,326
The car comes out here.

371
00:51:02,641 --> 00:51:06,805
A bodyguard and a driver. The guard
gets out first to open the door.

372
00:51:10,762 --> 00:51:14,278
He wears a bulletproof vest.
We let them get out.

373
00:51:16,442 --> 00:51:17,921
We hit the bodyguard first,
then the others.

374
00:51:21,123 --> 00:51:22,023
Come on.

375
00:52:14,446 --> 00:52:15,447
They're coming out.

376
00:52:15,646 --> 00:52:16,727
Coming.

377
00:52:16,886 --> 00:52:17,967
Black car.

378
00:52:18,646 --> 00:52:19,681
Wait for them to come out.

379
00:52:21,046 --> 00:52:22,002
I'll go for the bodyguard.

380
00:52:47,008 --> 00:52:48,043
What's going on?

381
00:53:33,492 --> 00:53:35,415
Come on, come on!

382
00:53:38,692 --> 00:53:39,648
See them?

383
00:53:42,212 --> 00:53:43,657
Yes, now I see them.

384
00:53:44,733 --> 00:53:46,451
- 3 cars in front.
- Follow them!

385
00:53:53,613 --> 00:53:56,856
It's turning. What do we do?
They stopped!

386
00:53:56,973 --> 00:54:00,887
- Go on. I'll kill them.
- How? It's an armored car.

387
00:54:01,733 --> 00:54:06,136
I tell you it's armored. If they don't
come out, there's nothing we can do.

388
00:54:13,815 --> 00:54:14,715
What's he doing?

389
00:54:15,534 --> 00:54:16,490
Buying tobacco.

390
00:54:31,336 --> 00:54:34,294
- I'll go.
- It won't work.

391
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:24,260
Macarggi here!

392
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:27,095
Down!

393
00:55:58,062 --> 00:56:02,067
I can't hear!
I hear nothing!

394
00:56:28,464 --> 00:56:31,229
This blood is not mine.
It's theirs.

395
00:56:48,746 --> 00:56:50,703
We've fucked you up, pigs!

396
00:57:00,426 --> 00:57:01,621
Are you Jacky Marcaggi?

397
00:57:03,387 --> 00:57:07,426
Don't talk. I can't hear. Just signs.
Do you know this guy?

398
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:12,262
Your friend Luciani sent us to kill you.

399
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:15,190
I won't do it. He's all yours.

400
00:57:15,588 --> 00:57:18,068
- Get revenge!
- I'll take care of him.

401
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:55,707
- Are you sleeping?
- No, no. I'm exhausted.

402
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:00,992
- Have you talked to Djamila?
- I'll sleep in the kids' room.

403
00:58:02,671 --> 00:58:06,187
-You won't go back tonight?
- No, I'll go back tomorrow.

404
00:58:08,471 --> 00:58:13,033
- They'll put you in a punishment cell.
- As the Corsicans kill each other.

405
00:58:15,472 --> 00:58:16,667
Need anything?

406
00:58:21,513 --> 00:58:23,197
I'm not doing chemo.

407
00:58:24,753 --> 00:58:26,027
You're screwed.

408
00:58:38,873 --> 00:58:42,116
Watch your sleeve.
You're rubbing it on the plate.

409
00:58:47,034 --> 00:58:49,719
- Eat a little, Riyad.
- I'm eating.

410
00:58:49,754 --> 00:58:52,394
-Want some more?
- No thanks.

411
00:58:52,914 --> 00:58:55,315
- Any good?
-Yes, delicious.

412
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,594
El Djebena, Mali.
35114T.

413
01:01:25,325 --> 01:01:28,010
40 days - 40 nights

414
01:03:04,133 --> 01:03:05,328
Are you there?

415
01:03:53,096 --> 01:03:54,370
Are you there?

416
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:24,226
Make sure you have everything
and sign here.

417
01:07:50,152 --> 01:07:51,267
Garbage.

418
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:12,640
Your exit papers.
The door.

419
01:08:14,274 --> 01:08:18,313
- Good luck, Djebena.
- Good day, sir.

420
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:29,080
Subtitles: Arigon

421
01:08:44,796 --> 01:08:45,696
How are you?

422
01:08:51,357 --> 01:08:52,257
- It's cold.
-Very.

423
01:08:54,837 --> 01:08:56,362
It's not a good time to come out.

424
01:09:02,598 --> 01:09:04,316
- Have you come by bus?
-Yes

425
01:09:06,598 --> 01:09:09,204
- When's the next one?
- Half an hour.

426
01:09:12,038 --> 01:09:14,359
-Want to walk a little?
- If you like.

427
01:09:15,919 --> 01:09:17,603
Do you know where you're going to live?

428
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:22,676
Come home. I'll sleep with the
child and you use his room.

429
01:09:23,879 --> 01:09:26,041
- I don't want to disturb.
-You won't.

430
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,284
Okay.
