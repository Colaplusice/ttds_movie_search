1
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,323
After twenty days of continuous bombing,

2
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:09,995
Nanking finally fell to the Japanese.

3
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,037
It was December the 13th, 1937.

4
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:14,368
I remember

5
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,073
everyone was running that day,

6
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:18,703
but no one could escape that heavy fog.

7
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,581
Major Li only had a few men left.

8
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:28,454
Nanking was no longer
able to put up a fight,

9
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:30,748
and those left behind, ran for their lives.

10
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,160
Stop counting.

11
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,823
Shu and two others are missing.

12
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:41,782
Let us in!

13
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,414
There's no room!

14
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,494
Find your own place to hide!

15
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,327
I said there's no more room!

16
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:49,281
Let's go.

17
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:03,827
Keep going!

18
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,992
Hey.

19
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:20,913
There are people inside.

20
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:21,913
Who is there?

21
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:22,867
Come out!

22
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:25,618
Come out!

23
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,243
Bastards!

24
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:35,452
Go to hell!

25
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,080
Stop!

26
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,163
Turn around!

27
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:43,989
Turn around!

28
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,114
Don't move!

29
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:52,989
American.

30
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,080
From the refuge.

31
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:54,784
What?

32
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,080
American.

33
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:57,788
Not soldier.

34
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,368
John Miller.

35
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:06,531
Raise your hands!

36
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,913
Working at the church.

37
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:09,281
Raise your hands!

38
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,615
I said raise your hands!

39
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:45,993
Separated...

40
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:49,374
You separated from your families?

41
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,456
You...

42
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,080
families...

43
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:56,406
separated?

44
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,868
I'm...

45
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,072
going to...

46
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,289
Winchester Cathedral.

47
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:05,868
You know where it is?

48
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,081
Where?

49
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,072
Mister.

50
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,322
Did you say...

51
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,538
Did you say "mister?"

52
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:25,739
Who said "mister?"

53
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:27,702
You speak English?

54
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,950
We are from Winchester Cathedral.

55
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:32,993
Say that again.

56
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:36,533
We are from Winchester Cathedral.

57
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,076
You're kidding?

58
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,619
We are students at the convent.

59
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,239
You going there?

60
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:46,782
Why do you want to go there?

61
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,411
I'm helping to bury your father.

62
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:53,408
Well, not your father father...

63
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,242
Father Ingleman.

64
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:55,372
Father Ingleman, yeah.

65
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,080
I'm helping burying him.

66
00:07:57,917 --> 00:07:59,908
Father Ingleman, I'm sending him off...

67
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,118
to heaven or wherever.

68
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,785
You show me the way?

69
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,288
Peng,

70
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,493
move to the flank,

71
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,284
prepare to engage.

72
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,039
Damn it, are you deaf?

73
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:54,951
Major Li,

74
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,289
we are the last ones left.

75
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:59,282
We should leave the city now.

76
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,197
Keep fighting.

77
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,239
Yes sir.

78
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:23,407
Got you!

79
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:16,697
Let's go.

80
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:17,409
Yes sir.

81
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,489
That way!

82
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:05,873
Up there, on the right!

83
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,948
On the left! Fire!

84
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:24,788
Cover them!

85
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,332
The Chinese army didn't
have adequate weapons

86
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,244
to destroy the enemy's tanks,

87
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:52,998
so they employed a tactic
from ancient warfare.

88
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,373
They formed a human shield

89
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,665
to get a bomb close to the tanks.

90
00:12:58,292 --> 00:12:59,498
At the time, the Chinese people

91
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,957
couldn't bear the thought
of their country,

92
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:03,873
and such selfless acts were not uncommon.

93
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,115
Zhen!

94
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,286
Let me go!

95
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:29,997
Zhen!

96
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:35,451
Come on!

97
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:05,827
Father Ingleman...

98
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,038
fly away.

99
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,080
Fly away?

100
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,117
On here, Japanese, bomb.

101
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,115
- He flew away with the bomb, right.
- Yes.

102
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:18,283
Why was the deceased out here?

103
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:20,783
- Gu. All because of Gu.
- Gu?

104
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,823
He said, bad smell.

105
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,331
He moved the body here.

106
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,330
Who's Gu?

107
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:28,453
Gu is our cook.

108
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:29,993
He ran away.

109
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,789
He leaves some students here.

110
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,370
Some students took away by parents.

111
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,994
Some students nowhere to go.

112
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,413
So who's inside?

113
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:41,910
Just you and the girls?

114
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,830
Just you and the girls.

115
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,455
Even without a body,

116
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,239
you gotta pay me.

117
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,329
No.

118
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,866
No... You gotta pay me.

119
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:54,497
No.

120
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:56,077
That's the rule.

121
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,993
There's nothing I can do about it.

122
00:17:58,708 --> 00:17:59,493
With what I came through,

123
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:00,993
I should raise the price.

124
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,413
So is the money inside?

125
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,368
No. No money.

126
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:04,907
Money? Inside?

127
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,163
No.

128
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,197
Come on.

129
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:08,748
There's no money inside?

130
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:09,326
No.

131
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,080
Let's look.

132
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:11,657
It's a Catholic church.

133
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,243
There's gotta be some cash inside.

134
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:13,997
No.

135
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:14,906
No?

136
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,368
You say anything but no?

137
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,535
Can you fix truck?

138
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:22,493
Help us.

139
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,114
Leave Nanking.

140
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,205
Fix this truck?

141
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,239
For free?

142
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:29,288
No.

143
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,203
I can take parts, sell parts.

144
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,205
You got tools?

145
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:34,489
No.

146
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:35,909
Let's get inside.

147
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:41,578
Zhen didn't even make a noise.

148
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:43,532
Even when they stabbed her over and over,

149
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:46,373
yet she didn't make a noise.

150
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:51,782
It's all my fault.

151
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,410
It's not your fault.

152
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,327
It is your fault.

153
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,407
Your father promised to take us

154
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,995
on a boat and leave Nanking.

155
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,035
Where is he?

156
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:04,657
He ran off.

157
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,368
We waited and waited

158
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:08,783
and now the Japanese are here.

159
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:10,782
Now the Japanese are everywhere,

160
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,040
and it's too late to go to the refuge.

161
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,539
Zhen died because of your father!

162
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,080
Shut up!

163
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,789
What are you doing?

164
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,993
Stop!

165
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,955
Stop fighting!

166
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:28,614
Hey.

167
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:29,822
Hey.

168
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:33,532
Hey! Stop!

169
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,367
Stop!

170
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,707
I'm John. Hi.

171
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,455
I'm American.

172
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,619
He's the mortician for Father's funeral.

173
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,573
I know it's hard.

174
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,956
But you've gotta stop fighting everybody.

175
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,366
You know you two... you've seen enough...

176
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,287
seen enough tragedy for a lifetime today.

177
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:08,202
I can't... um...

178
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:09,993
I'm not good with kids.

179
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:10,997
Let's go.

180
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,074
You want some flour?
You like some flour?

181
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,832
- Make some bread for the girls.
- Buns.

182
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,705
Buns.

183
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:19,864
Buns, whatever.

184
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,661
Let's go find the collection box.

185
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:28,447
Where?

186
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:30,031
- Upstairs?
- No.

187
00:20:34,542 --> 00:20:35,497
Oh, nice.

188
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:38,078
Forget going back to the refuge,

189
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,332
I think I'm bunking here tonight.

190
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:47,373
He's grim, who's that?

191
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:50,910
Is that Father Ingleman?

192
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:51,705
Yes.

193
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,081
These North Europeans they're all like,

194
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,491
you know, tuna, playwrights,

195
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,080
not much fun.

196
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,914
Look at that face,

197
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,870
he's ruining the...

198
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,790
What do you call it? Feng... Fengshui?

199
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:09,371
I can't have a priest staring at me

200
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,699
- while I'm sleeping.
- No...

201
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,864
My father.

202
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,205
Me...

203
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,364
orphan...

204
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:20,781
adopted.

205
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:21,705
I'm sorry.

206
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:22,781
But I just...

207
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,949
It's not good for me to have a priest

208
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,911
staring at me while I'm sleeping.

209
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:28,989
I can't.

210
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,788
Please, I gotta just... there, better.

211
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,789
You got any drink around here?

212
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:35,538
No.

213
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,911
You're a church.
You got wine, something?

214
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:38,663
Nothing.

215
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:39,656
Nothing?

216
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,074
- No.
- No, no...

217
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,243
That's a shaving kit.

218
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:55,580
What a jerk!

219
00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:58,202
I said you are a jerk!

220
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:00,907
What did you say your name was?

221
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,580
George Chen.

222
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:03,910
George.

223
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:05,247
Tomorrow,

224
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:07,577
you fix truck,

225
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:09,447
help us.

226
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,489
Fix truck?

227
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,368
No money!

228
00:22:17,042 --> 00:22:17,997
Money, George.

229
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:24,788
Gu.

230
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,744
Open the door, it's Ling.

231
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,035
Can you hear me

232
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:30,956
Gu.

233
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:31,989
Open up.

234
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:33,993
It's Ling.

235
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:35,497
Did you really make a deal with him?

236
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:36,372
Of course.

237
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:37,998
Otherwise I wouldn't
have brought you here.

238
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,619
Gu.

239
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,077
Open the door, it's Ling.

240
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,990
Gu, have you gone deaf?

241
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,331
Someone's here.

242
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,785
Where's Gu? Ask him to come out.

243
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,118
Go to the refuge on the west side.

244
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:51,123
Leave now, go to the refuge.

245
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:53,283
No, we're here for Gu.

246
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,288
Gu's not here.

247
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,618
Bullshit! Get out of my way!

248
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,659
Gu told me,

249
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,448
this church is under Western protection.

250
00:22:58,625 --> 00:22:59,956
The Japanese can't come in.

251
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,332
Bastard! I served Gu all night for free,

252
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,489
he promised to let us stay.

253
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:04,702
Ask that bastard Gu to come out!

254
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:05,614
He's really not here.

255
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:06,281
How come?

256
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,618
He ran off this morning.

257
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:09,323
You should go to the refuge.

258
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:30,785
We're not leaving.

259
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,369
Hey! How dare you!

260
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,205
Hurry.

261
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:50,490
Go to the refuge!

262
00:23:50,917 --> 00:23:51,747
To the refuge!

263
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:54,033
The refuge doesn't even
have space left for maggots.

264
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,870
Please, have some mercy and let us in.

265
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,831
Don't jump.

266
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,535
They're from the red-light district.

267
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:28,827
What's that?

268
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,407
It means brothel.

269
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,241
They were the famous
women of the Qin Huai River.

270
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:40,948
The myths surrounding them

271
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:43,578
were as ancient as the city of Nanking.

272
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:53,414
That's a Westerner!

273
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:54,413
Is he a priest?

274
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:55,698
No way.

275
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,411
What kind of priest would be such a flirt?

276
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:58,572
Who cares,

277
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,206
as long as he can protect us.

278
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,239
True.

279
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,163
Come up here.

280
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:42,031
This was stolen from the bowels of hell.

281
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,574
Long time not make bread.

282
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,991
Long time not make bread? No bread?

283
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:49,328
Not tonight, tonight we're having bread.

284
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:55,290
These women quickly took over the cellar.

285
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:57,783
It was once a filthy, messy place,

286
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,698
but within hours,

287
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,786
they had transformed it
into the Qin Huai River.

288
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,368
The fragrance of rouge and perfume

289
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:05,248
danced up through the air.

290
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,239
I can smell the bread.

291
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,410
We are coming up!

292
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,865
I couldn't stop them.

293
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:48,538
Hello.

294
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:53,493
I remember

295
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:56,082
when I first saw these women,

296
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:59,079
they were tramps,
parading around in their lingerie,

297
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:00,698
not the graceful ladies
that the legends of Qin Huai

298
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:01,739
had portrayed them to be.

299
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,748
Look, this should be good.

300
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:27,288
George,

301
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:28,497
you little shit,

302
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:30,748
you said there was no wine here.

303
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:32,072
Excuse me.

304
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,830
What's he saying?

305
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:38,203
Holy hooch!

306
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:40,947
How dare you drink the wine!

307
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:42,331
Now the Westerner Knows about the wine.

308
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,115
We sell the wine to raise
money for orphans.

309
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:45,281
We're all orphans.

310
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:47,073
We also need help.

311
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:48,828
That's right.

312
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,114
What are they saying?

313
00:27:50,292 --> 00:27:51,532
They said they're orphans!

314
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:52,413
Orphans?

315
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:54,282
Well, I'd like to adopt all of you,

316
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:55,117
right now.

317
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:56,827
Adopt all of us?

318
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,073
You would not be able to cope.

319
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:03,869
You are not the only
ones who speak English!

320
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:04,656
That's right!

321
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:07,913
You speak English?

322
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,573
The Westerner is a playboy.

323
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:25,411
Of course! Haven't you heard?

324
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:28,700
Westerners with beards are the horniest!

325
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,289
No wonder she is
the top girl of the Qin Huai River.

326
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:32,868
Mo, use all of your skills.

327
00:28:33,042 --> 00:28:34,748
Seduce him!

328
00:28:34,917 --> 00:28:36,248
That's right.

329
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:39,329
Make the big nose go crazy for us!

330
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,365
My name is John.

331
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,364
And you are?

332
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:52,493
Yu Mo.

333
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:53,743
Yu Mo.

334
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:55,243
I like that.

335
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,663
So what do you and your companions do?

336
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:02,032
We are kindergarten teachers.

337
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,164
Really? Kindergarten teachers.

338
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,034
Shameless.

339
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:05,822
And you?

340
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,910
What do you do?

341
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,244
I'm also a kindergarten teacher.

342
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,864
So as,

343
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,740
teacher to teacher,

344
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,739
you wanna...

345
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:19,495
get together and have a cup of joe, or...

346
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,830
What're those two yapping about?

347
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,534
Tell me.

348
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:24,450
Nothing. He's asking your price.

349
00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:25,906
I told him.

350
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:27,789
He thinks you are too cheap.

351
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,660
There's no coffee.

352
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,289
Let's get liquored up.

353
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,580
Cheers.

354
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:30,165
The kindergarten fee is enough?

355
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,580
You coming?

356
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:46,866
I want you to take us out of Nanking.

357
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:55,122
Yeah.

358
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:56,367
Right.

359
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:57,492
We do this first?

360
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:58,827
I'm serious.

361
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:02,204
Why else you think we
were flirting with you?

362
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:06,664
Out of Nanking, how?

363
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,285
I don't know how,

364
00:31:09,792 --> 00:31:12,408
but I know your face is
the way out of here.

365
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:14,869
The Japanese won't touch Westerners.

366
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,539
Did you see it out there?

367
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:18,823
That's not happening.

368
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:21,947
No.

369
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:23,955
Cash enough?

370
00:31:24,792 --> 00:31:26,328
Cause... let's...

371
00:31:38,042 --> 00:31:38,997
Are you kidding?

372
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:39,947
Are you kidding?

373
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:41,080
Wait...

374
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,366
Let's work this out. Let's work it out.

375
00:31:44,542 --> 00:31:45,452
Think about it.

376
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:47,118
If you help us,

377
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:48,907
I will thank you in ways

378
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:51,074
you can never imagine.

379
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:53,618
All of us will.

380
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:57,748
Can I get an advance?

381
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,707
The Japanese have posted a notice,

382
00:32:24,917 --> 00:32:26,782
whoever harbors soldiers will be shot.

383
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,581
I'll shoot you first.

384
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,160
Little bastard.

385
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:32,198
Open up. Carry that guy in.

386
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,659
Get up.

387
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:11,781
Get some water.

388
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:21,156
Hurry up!

389
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:24,198
What a temper.

390
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:25,785
He thinks he's so tough.

391
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,243
He thinks he's a hero.

392
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:30,123
Since he's fighting the Japanese,

393
00:33:30,292 --> 00:33:32,499
protecting Nanking and women like us,

394
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:34,453
he feels he is entitled to have a temper.

395
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:36,999
Women like us need to hide here.

396
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:39,783
But if he hides here, he's a coward.

397
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:40,492
True.

398
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:41,998
Yeah, what a sissy!

399
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:46,785
Got scissors?

400
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:54,872
Thanks.

401
00:34:07,917 --> 00:34:09,407
- You ruined my dress!
- Don't touch him!

402
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:12,368
Save your attitude for the Japs.

403
00:34:12,542 --> 00:34:13,702
They are searching for
Chinese soldiers like you.

404
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:14,830
You are endangering us!

405
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,410
There are convent girls here, too.

406
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:17,493
Understand?

407
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:25,242
Towel.

408
00:34:38,417 --> 00:34:39,657
What a handsome face.

409
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:42,782
Dou has good taste in men.

410
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,865
I mean he looks like my brother.

411
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,956
Are you hot for him?

412
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,286
No, he really looks like my brother.

413
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:50,743
You have a crush on him.

414
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:52,202
No, I don't.

415
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:53,364
Dou, cool off.

416
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:55,078
He doesn't even have hair down there!

417
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:06,539
He was homeless, so our troop took him in.

418
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,535
He's called Pu Sheng.

419
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:08,747
He's just a child.

420
00:35:09,042 --> 00:35:10,282
Why are you leaving him with us?

421
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,330
Get some cloth,

422
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,785
tighten the bandage

423
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:14,947
so he won't bleed too much.

424
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:17,202
It's the best I can do.

425
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:19,577
I want him to be in a warm place

426
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,365
before he dies.

427
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:24,622
Thank you.

428
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:06,660
Please wait.

429
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:16,864
What do you want?

430
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:18,581
We have sharp tongues,

431
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:20,740
and we were very rude.

432
00:37:21,542 --> 00:37:23,328
I hope you can forgive us.

433
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,124
Don't point a gun at a man of the cloth.

434
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:39,031
Mo.

435
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,911
Like me as a priest? Do you?

436
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:45,373
I dressed up for you.

437
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:47,039
I got a chance now?

438
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:52,993
Is he the priest?

439
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:56,368
Does he belong to the church?

440
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,239
You can say that.

441
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:01,199
What, the bank's closed
for me, but he gets...

442
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:03,991
He gets a special soldier
discount or something?

443
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:07,618
Please tell him,

444
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:09,618
the students can't end up

445
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:11,032
in the hands of the Japanese.

446
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,831
Otherwise my men would have died

447
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,410
for nothing.

448
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:25,748
What's wrong with you?

449
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,114
I want to help you.

450
00:38:27,292 --> 00:38:28,953
I've joined the priesthood.

451
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:30,706
Stop it. It's not the right time.

452
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:31,990
You don't want cash.

453
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:33,247
You want me to save you.

454
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:34,873
I'm gonna save your soul.

455
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:37,036
I'll absolve you of your sins tonight.

456
00:38:37,292 --> 00:38:39,453
Blessed are thee among women.

457
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:42,825
Blessed are thy lips,
blessed are thy eyes,

458
00:38:43,292 --> 00:38:44,122
blessed are thy hips...

459
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:44,872
Don't.

460
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:47,533
and thy gams, and thy chest...

461
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:48,572
Stop it!

462
00:38:50,417 --> 00:38:51,281
- Stop it!
- I gotta...

463
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:52,914
Stop it!

464
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:54,948
You drunk bastard!

465
00:38:58,458 --> 00:38:59,789
This is a house of love not war,

466
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:00,947
you get out of here.

467
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:02,281
Who's he really?

468
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:04,581
An idiot. Don't mind him.

469
00:39:05,792 --> 00:39:06,747
Fine, I'll leave now.

470
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:19,284
See,

471
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,282
I'm the only man for you.

472
00:39:23,042 --> 00:39:24,248
You're such a fool!

473
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:26,494
If it wasn't for your foreign face...

474
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:27,747
I like it when you're angry.

475
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:28,781
I wouldn't even look at you!

476
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:29,617
Harder.

477
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:31,619
I'll never be into you.

478
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:32,614
Come here.

479
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:33,451
Get off me!

480
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,122
I love that!

481
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,831
I love seeing you walk away.

482
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,115
I love seeing that ass.

483
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:42,742
Mo!

484
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:45,157
Mo!

485
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,660
That night,

486
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:49,248
Major Li didn't go far.

487
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,331
He stayed at the paper
shop across the street.

488
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:52,663
I know,

489
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:54,831
he could have changed into
civilian clothing and fled.

490
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,240
I said you can't go in!

491
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:11,785
Little sister,

492
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:14,165
we won't shit or piss in there.

493
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:16,328
We just want to wash up.

494
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,242
We always wash before bed-time.

495
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,702
Bed-time?

496
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:24,830
Morning for you is night for us.

497
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:25,951
Little sister...

498
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:26,989
Don't call me sister!

499
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:28,498
You want to start a fight?

500
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:29,497
The bathroom is for people.

501
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:30,873
You mean we are not people?

502
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:32,373
You know what you are!

503
00:40:32,542 --> 00:40:33,622
You've got some nerve!

504
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,578
We won't share the bathroom with you!

505
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:38,327
What a temper!

506
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,286
Sorry, go back to your rat hole.

507
00:40:41,417 --> 00:40:42,406
What the hell?

508
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:43,538
She's humiliating us.

509
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,198
She thinks we are filthy.

510
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:46,205
Little bitch!

511
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,455
You're the bitch!

512
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:49,331
Watch your mouth!

513
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,536
Ling, want to see a good fight?

514
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:52,493
Really?

515
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:54,869
I thought you'd only fight for Mo.

516
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:56,868
Let's pull down your pants

517
00:40:57,042 --> 00:40:58,748
and see what you are made of.

518
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,411
Don't touch me, you filthy whore!

519
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:04,245
Let's find out if you really
are cleaner than us.

520
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,161
Stop it! It's not fair!

521
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:08,118
I don't have to hit you,

522
00:41:08,292 --> 00:41:09,702
I can just crush you with my butt!

523
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:12,244
I don't give a damn, I'm going in.

524
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:13,910
I won't let you go in!

525
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:17,913
Stop fighting!

526
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:18,955
What's going on?

527
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:20,114
Stop!

528
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:23,118
What are you doing?

529
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,160
Are you crazy?

530
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:25,872
We are just kids!

531
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:26,747
Hua, that's enough.

532
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:27,906
No, it's not over!

533
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:29,914
I won't let you go in!

534
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,577
Japanese!

535
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,785
Go to the cellar, I'll tell the others!

536
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:57,823
Search the yard!

537
00:42:09,667 --> 00:42:11,077
Split up!

538
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:21,163
Hurry! Go to the cellar!

539
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:02,705
Come in, hurry!

540
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:10,039
Don't shut it, let the girls in.

541
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:11,414
Let the girls in!

542
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,038
Hurry!

543
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,997
Don't move!

544
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:27,406
Lieutenant Asakura!

545
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:28,743
Come over here!

546
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,205
Upstairs!

547
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:24,413
Hurry!

548
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:26,118
Let's move the shelves!

549
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:31,614
There are girls here!

550
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:32,822
Search everywhere!

551
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:34,455
Capture them alive!

552
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,535
Lieutenant Asakura!

553
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:03,198
Come up here!

554
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:04,868
We've got virgins!

555
00:46:05,417 --> 00:46:06,623
Hurry!

556
00:46:07,542 --> 00:46:08,372
Stop!

557
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,614
Girls! Girls!

558
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:03,322
Stop!

559
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,330
Stop!

560
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:07,413
Stop!

561
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,198
This is a house of the Lord!

562
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,115
These are children!

563
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:15,871
You are breaking the laws
of man and of God!

564
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,115
No soldiers here!

565
00:47:18,292 --> 00:47:20,328
You have no business being here!

566
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,285
I am the priest!

567
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:23,873
And I command you,

568
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:26,867
in the name of the Father to leave now!

569
00:47:27,292 --> 00:47:28,953
Girls, you come up here now!

570
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:30,614
Come up these stairs,

571
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:31,743
and stand behind me.

572
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:34,948
You're honorable men,

573
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:36,285
behave honorably!

574
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:15,163
I'll eat you up.

575
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,537
Stop! Stop this! Stop! Run!

576
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:42,536
Stop this! Don't...

577
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:15,205
Chinese soldiers!

578
00:50:15,667 --> 00:50:17,328
Get them!

579
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:19,785
Let's go!

580
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:29,290
Assemble outside! Roll call!

581
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:30,664
Prepare for combat!

582
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:16,990
The sniper is across the street!

583
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:18,823
To your left!

584
00:51:58,292 --> 00:52:00,453
It's a trap! Find the enemy!

585
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:32,409
Damn it!

586
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:34,198
He's in the building there!

587
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:42,781
Use the grenades!

588
00:53:07,625 --> 00:53:09,286
Behind us! Fire!

589
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:11,868
Keep firing!

590
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:00,955
Hold your fire!

591
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:48,242
Wait!

592
00:55:12,958 --> 00:55:13,572
Fire!

593
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,581
First platoon to the back gate!

594
00:56:01,167 --> 00:56:02,998
Second platoon to the front gate!

595
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,785
Colonel,

596
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,241
he used to work for the
traffic department.

597
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,240
Most roads in Nanking are destroyed.

598
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:16,782
Having him can be useful.

599
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:18,656
Speak Japanese?

600
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:19,413
Yes.

601
00:56:49,292 --> 00:56:51,283
Were our soldiers here recently?

602
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:54,664
Are you the resident priest?

603
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:57,659
Yes.

604
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:58,367
Father,

605
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:01,207
I apologize on behalf of our soldiers.

606
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:02,788
Please understand.

607
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:04,368
In the middle of a war,

608
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:07,541
occasional unfortunate
behavior is inevitable.

609
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:10,868
Your church

610
00:57:11,042 --> 00:57:12,407
is very beautiful.

611
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,285
How do you do?

612
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:18,414
Are you students here at the convent?

613
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:20,493
So sorry to have caused you alarm.

614
00:57:20,667 --> 00:57:21,201
Please...

615
00:57:22,417 --> 00:57:24,078
don't hurt the children anymore.

616
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:25,163
Naturally.

617
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:26,873
My name is Hasegawa.

618
00:57:27,292 --> 00:57:29,829
I am responsible for
the safety of this area.

619
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:31,368
Please do not worry...

620
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:33,698
about the security of the church

621
00:57:33,875 --> 00:57:34,705
and the students.

622
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:37,535
I apologize...

623
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:42,406
but I have no confidence...
in that assurance.

624
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,453
My guarantee is effective.

625
00:57:44,958 --> 00:57:45,868
From now on,

626
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:48,744
I shall post armed guards
in front of the church

627
00:57:48,917 --> 00:57:50,202
to protect you all.

628
00:57:58,917 --> 00:58:00,407
There is not a lot of food

629
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:02,039
in Nanking at the moment.

630
00:58:02,708 --> 00:58:05,120
I hope the students will not go hungry.

631
00:58:14,792 --> 00:58:15,406
May I?

632
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:13,784
Thank you.

633
00:59:15,667 --> 00:59:16,531
Did you like it?

634
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:21,207
This is a Japanese folk song,

635
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:22,452
"My Home."

636
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:24,789
It is about hills and rabbits,

637
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:26,619
and streams full of fish.

638
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:29,494
It is the most beautiful song in the world

639
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:31,157
for those who are homesick.

640
00:59:39,667 --> 00:59:41,282
Do the students sing well?

641
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:46,869
Very well, yes.

642
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,118
That's good.

643
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:49,322
I shall come back

644
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,081
in a couple of days to hear them.

645
00:59:52,917 --> 00:59:53,531
Why?

646
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:54,822
No reason.

647
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:57,865
I happen to love music.

648
00:59:58,417 --> 01:00:00,703
Father, we shall meet again soon.

649
01:00:42,083 --> 01:00:45,905
I hope you will not be
lonely buried together.

650
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,080
Father John.

651
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:16,787
You won't leave us, will you?

652
01:01:32,292 --> 01:01:34,032
We shouldn't have taken over your cellar.

653
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,239
Sorry.

654
01:01:39,292 --> 01:01:40,953
If we hadn't fought with that girl,

655
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:42,331
she would still be alive.

656
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:43,914
This is all our fault.

657
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:54,410
Thank you.

658
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:08,199
Why not answer Shu?

659
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,410
She called me Father John.

660
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:16,493
We all need you.

661
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:17,782
I'm a mortician.

662
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:19,697
You are priest.

663
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:20,705
No.

664
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,160
- If we have a priest...
- George.

665
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:25,494
maybe Japanese...

666
01:02:25,792 --> 01:02:27,077
not dare...

667
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:28,572
You are priest!

668
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,115
George, I'm not.

669
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:32,993
I'm not a priest.

670
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:33,622
I'm not!

671
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:35,077
I stayed here,

672
01:02:35,417 --> 01:02:38,124
because I was looking for your cash.

673
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:41,073
And because that's the nicest bed that

674
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,706
I've slept in in years. I didn't get there.

675
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:45,116
But is that like a priest? I'm not a priest!

676
01:02:45,875 --> 01:02:46,455
I'm not.

677
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:49,617
I took catechism lessons as a kid.

678
01:02:49,792 --> 01:02:52,454
Sometimes I remember that when I'm drunk,

679
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:54,490
which I am as often as I can be.

680
01:03:02,875 --> 01:03:04,661
You not be priest.

681
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:08,036
Tell girls yourself.

682
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:29,615
You little shit!

683
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:32,993
You are.

684
01:03:50,917 --> 01:03:52,828
We've heard about what happen today.

685
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:54,455
So you're staying?

686
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:03,489
Yeah.

687
01:04:05,083 --> 01:04:05,697
Even though you were

688
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,490
a drunk bastard last night,

689
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:09,581
what you did today makes you a hero.

690
01:04:15,292 --> 01:04:17,078
I'm sorry about last night.

691
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:20,489
Yeah.

692
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:24,581
I can't leave them by themselves.

693
01:04:25,625 --> 01:04:26,284
And that little shit

694
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:28,824
has a way of just... you know.

695
01:04:31,417 --> 01:04:33,499
What do you think the Japanese are up to?

696
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:36,411
Are they really here to
protect the students?

697
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:44,073
We were counting on having you

698
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,535
help us leave Nanking.

699
01:04:45,708 --> 01:04:47,323
But I guess now you'll have to

700
01:04:47,542 --> 01:04:49,407
stay here and be a priest.

701
01:04:51,042 --> 01:04:52,782
Yeah, right.

702
01:04:54,792 --> 01:04:55,451
Priest.

703
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:00,535
Actually, I came to tell you,

704
01:05:00,667 --> 01:05:02,157
our offer is still good.

705
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:04,244
We still want you to help us escape.

706
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:06,665
As soon as the Japanese guards are gone.

707
01:05:08,167 --> 01:05:10,078
Just now the ladies were having a bet.

708
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:13,165
They said that hero or no hero,

709
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:14,364
you don't stand a chance

710
01:05:14,542 --> 01:05:16,908
when you're up against a beauty like me.

711
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,115
Don't flatter yourself.

712
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,322
We'll see.

713
01:05:50,917 --> 01:05:51,872
Did you like it?

714
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:56,197
I only have one string.

715
01:05:56,375 --> 01:05:58,240
It sound like a beggar's plea. Even worse.
