6
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:24,578
lndian captain Kabir Khan who is in his best 
format leading the team with vigour.

7
00:01:32,757 --> 00:01:34,224
For the suspence of the audience...

8
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:39,894
.. tension is on the faces of lndian and Pakistani official.

9
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:44,558
When these 2 nations frights, the tempo 
becomes high for the audience.

10
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:49,129
Just 2 and 1/2 minutes left... Something has to be done
for lndia.

11
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,676
Ball is with the Pakistani defender.

12
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:03,354
Utham singh has taken the possession of the ball from
Pakistani defender and moving forward.

13
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:47,257
lndia has got a Penalty stroke.

14
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:52,660
This is the last chance to save from losing the match
at the last minute of the game.

15
00:02:54,172 --> 00:02:56,868
<i>Now we will see who's taking the stroke.</i>

16
00:02:58,243 --> 00:03:01,974
With the decision of the team Captain Kabir Kban
takes the stroke.

17
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:07,910
The entire nation is watching Kabhir Khan.

18
00:04:39,577 --> 00:04:41,909
Hello... where is Kabir?

19
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:45,874
Can you explain what happened on the ground?

20
00:04:46,217 --> 00:04:48,651
Do you think that Pakistani team is better than lndia?

21
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:49,148
May be...

22
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:51,551
Why did you take the penalty stroke at the last minute?

23
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:52,519
lts my mistake.

24
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:54,956
We heard that the player on the other side is
your friend.

25
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,491
Because you hugged and shaken hands with him
after the match.

26
00:04:58,797 --> 00:04:59,593
Excuse me.

27
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:04,031
We heard that some one from your team purposely
lost the match.

28
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:05,133
Excuse me.

29
00:05:05,637 --> 00:05:08,333

00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:15,172
Kabir Khan, ls there any money transaction on this

00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,835

00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:45,666
His anger and fright agains us confirms the conclusion..

34
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,144
There is something behind this brihery scandal.
We got our conclusion.

35
00:05:50,615 --> 00:05:55,279
Now it is your turn to decide whether Kabir Kban
is a Traitor or not.

36
00:05:56,154 --> 00:06:00,352
Sathyavritav Yadav, National Stadium, New Delhi.

37
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:09,296
lmportant News: Pakistan beat lndia by 1 Goal at the
Mens World Cup Hockey Championship.

38
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:15,562
Greetings. You are watching AAJ TAK.

39
00:06:15,974 --> 00:06:23,813
Today we are here to say that the lndian Hockey
association
issued notice to decide about Kabir Kban
after losing the match today.

40
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:30,451
Now its you the lndian public to decide on this issue.
We have two people here to discuss the issue.

41
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:43,159
Do you think Kabir Khan lost the match purposely to
Pakistan?

42
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:45,199
l don't know whether he purposely lost or not.. But
they have lost it.

43
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:47,971
What do you think?
We must turn this kind of people upside down.

44
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:52,642
What do you think? This kind of people should have
been
sent to Pakistan during partition.

45
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:03,620
We don't know the whereabouts of Kabir Khan.

46
00:07:03,855 --> 00:07:07,416
We couldn't locate him neither Hockey Stadium nor
lndian Sports
Authority Complex. Where is Kabir Khan?

47
00:07:51,936 --> 00:07:54,496
Don't look backwards.. Lets go..

48
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:56,667
How come l not see? Kabir.

49
00:07:58,076 --> 00:08:04,413
Your Grandpa saved every little
penny to buy this land.

50
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:09,715
He struggled so much from his first savings.

51
00:08:10,888 --> 00:08:12,753
lt hurts a lot son...

52
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:15,559
Let us find some peace.

53
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:19,794
You see they will come to know the truth one day.

54
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:32,940
Traitor

55
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:36,707
Don't look at that son...

56
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:45,613
lf you don't want, don't see anything...
But l want to see everything.

57
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:49,720
Lets go from here...

58
00:08:54,465 --> 00:08:57,957

Whats your decision?

61
00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:17,072
What? Everytime you bring the same thing.

62
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:19,874
What do you want to do for the coach?

63
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:22,252
Now you tell me...

tournament.

65
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:29,090
Let it go.
What is with that?

66
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:34,364
lndian Womens Hockey team can do nothing.

67
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:38,094
lts a govenment tour.

68
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:42,038
You also do something and go with them.

69
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:48,207
As it is, they will be finished within 3 or 4 matches.
Exit.

70
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:54,077
Thats why, you take Mrs. V adera and enjoy the tour
abroad.

71
00:10:56,921 --> 00:11:00,152
l don't understand, why you don't take
the womens hockey team seriously.

72
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:04,283
l don't understand why you take so serious?

73
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:13,102
They are lndian women.
They can't play wearing shorts.

74
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:14,429
l'm sorry.

75
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:17,268
How come you guys talk like this sitting
here at the association office?

76
00:11:17,508 --> 00:11:20,944
We are in association, public is

77
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:28,481
For that players are coming

78
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:29,778
Punjab

79
00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:31,079
Tamil Nadu

80
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:33,356
Jharkand

00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:35,955
Andhra Ailways.

00:11:37,128 --> 00:11:40,256
Even from Mizoram and anipur

83
00:11:41,165 --> 00:11:42,757
Where did you get a coach for them?

84
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:44,861
From the moon! Just kidding.

85
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:47,035
You tell me this is it the girls mistake?

86

Not their.. lts people like you

87
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:57,305
We must have atleast media coverage, tv channels
and sponsors.

88
00:11:57,748 --> 00:12:01,946
Now tell me which coach will forward for womens

99
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:55,096
We must capture the opponent teams strategy for the
goal
using our brain.

100
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,236
Goal will come by itself.

101
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:01,073
Sir, They are calling you inside.

102

00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:30,339

Hockey Team.

107
00:13:37,515 --> 00:13:39,449
Kabir Sir.
You not a kid.

108
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:47,821
You must know that countries like ours keep
womens hockey team for the name sake.

109
00:13:47,822 --> 00:13:49,522
Not for the jOh.

110
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:54,688
As it is, your reputation is already...

.. you want to bring back your
reputation with this team..

112
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:07,842
Team like this will never win even with an european
school team.

113
00:14:12,883 --> 00:14:17,877
l need a team like that.
-What do you mean? l can't understand.

114
00:14:19,357 --> 00:14:20,722
You can't understand.

115
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:29,094
May l take it like l am appinted.

116
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,871
As it is you don't have any
alternative coach.

117
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:55,855
l have done my jOh.

118
00:14:57,228 --> 00:14:59,753
Even now you think it again.
l thought about it.

119
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:04,022
This is not a Team.. lts a Grave yard...

120
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:06,029
Why do you step into it?

121
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:10,803
This team won't get better
coach than you.

122
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:13,766
But think about you..
- l'm thinking...

123
00:15:16,814 --> 00:15:19,282
You have changed a lot.

124
00:15:19,984 --> 00:15:23,852
l haven't changed.
Nothing has changed.

125
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:31,785
You were not responsible for that match.
You played very hard.

126
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:36,262
But they killed me, my team and my nation.

127
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:36,265
But they killed me, my team and my nation.

128
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:38,323
Against my family wishes.

129
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:41,294
0ne mistake can be forgiven by people.

130
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:45,403
Everyone.

131
00:15:49,947 --> 00:15:52,814

Cup with this team.

133
00:15:57,955 --> 00:15:59,115
Which is not possible.

134
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:08,531
When is your girls are coming?

Listen sister. They are not allowing me
to leave from this Hockey association.

Why is she here? She has come.

142
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:09,453
You are asking 10o rupees, do you keep this meter on
your head?

143
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:11,492
Meter is faulty. You have to give 1o0.

144
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:16,131
Whom are you talking? l am talking to you and lf you

Don't get angry, it will damage your brain.

146
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:22,237
You are not telling anything at him?

147
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:24,498
He is my child or you are my child?

148

149

l kept the box first, so bed becomes mine.

257
00:28:34,744 --> 00:28:36,609
Do you think bed belongs to you because
you kept the box?

258
00:28:36,847 --> 00:28:39,111
Then what? Have you ever traveled by bus on roads?

259
00:28:39,516 --> 00:28:41,177
l reserved it first.

260

But my name is on the list for this place.

261
00:28:58,068 --> 00:28:59,763

Until you get a chance.

267
00:29:22,225 --> 00:29:23,283

out of 50 crore women in this country.

270
00:29:51,988 --> 00:29:54,422
This sounds nice and bad too...

271
00:29:55,425 --> 00:29:57,916
Now l'm going to tell my decision on this.

272
00:29:59,496 --> 00:30:03,933
For me only 16 girls has come,
which is a shock to hockey.

273
00:30:04,868 --> 00:30:07,803
Don't keep anything other than this.

274
00:30:15,812 --> 00:30:17,211
10 kilometeres

275

We are playing or running
a marathon?

278
00:31:13,236 --> 00:31:16,262
We have done enough
after getting up at 4am.

279
00:31:18,108 --> 00:31:20,668
He doesn't know how to treat
national level players.

280
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:30,208
Go.

281
00:31:36,092 --> 00:31:37,059

Yours is right side position right. Sir...
l think you better take the right side position.

285
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:58,143
l was centre forward in Haryana.
- Then go and play in the Haryana team.

286
00:31:58,815 --> 00:32:00,112
Everybody is in position.

287
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:13,795
Hi.. Coach told me to play on the forward line.

288
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:17,330
You go home and play.

289
00:32:23,773 --> 00:32:24,899
Do one thing?

290
00:32:25,475 --> 00:32:30,913
You go and play with them. But coach sir...
Can you do whatever he says?

291
00:32:31,214 --> 00:32:32,704
But coach...

292
00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:34,776
Coach will come and go.

293
00:32:35,485 --> 00:32:37,146
But you are living with us, right.

294
00:32:38,588 --> 00:32:40,818
Look.. Everyone goes to drink water. Go..

295
00:32:41,725 --> 00:32:43,920
And listen, don't take my name.

296
00:32:51,835 --> 00:32:52,563
What happened?

297
00:32:55,505 --> 00:32:56,699
Every year l play forward position.

298
00:32:57,307 --> 00:32:59,275
But in this team you play only centre.
This team or that team...

299
00:33:00,076 --> 00:33:01,373
Makes no difference to me.

300
00:33:02,445 --> 00:33:03,275
But its a problem for the team.

301
00:33:04,614 --> 00:33:05,706
You are senior and strong player.

302
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,579
Team requires you at the Center balf.

303
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,287
Go to your new position.

304
00:33:13,456 --> 00:33:13,922

What is it? l've made the goal.

309
00:35:25,388 --> 00:35:28,414
Didnt you see what she did before?

00:35:28,558 --> 00:35:30,253
l know what l'm looking at.

311
00:35:30,493 --> 00:35:32,586
When scored the goal, nobody went near.

312
00:35:34,364 --> 00:35:37,822
When you put the goal she was with
you and in scoring position.

313
00:35:41,504 --> 00:35:42,300
0ut...

314
00:35:48,244 --> 00:35:49,711
Yeah.. Look at her..

315
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:51,711
When she makes mistake, you keep quite.

316
00:35:55,118 --> 00:35:59,145
Come home. l'll let you know who am l.

317
00:36:01,224 --> 00:36:02,953
Sad we got him as coach.

318
00:36:05,295 --> 00:36:08,162
Coach.. God is not with him.

319
00:36:08,798 --> 00:36:10,663
very good.. Hands, closer...

320
00:36:14,404 --> 00:36:17,601
Ah.. Lets relax.

321
00:36:48,938 --> 00:36:49,802
0ut...

322
00:37:01,617 --> 00:37:02,675
Hey look...

323
00:37:03,786 --> 00:37:06,516
lf you angry, will pour chilly sauce so
everything comes out.

324
00:37:23,006 --> 00:37:25,167
Stop. Whats happening?

325
00:37:27,643 --> 00:37:29,372
You knew that she doesn't speak Punjabi.

326
00:37:29,645 --> 00:37:33,479
l was coming on the right side.

327
00:37:34,283 --> 00:37:37,775
Say sorry to her.
l never asked sorry with anyone.

328
00:37:38,254 --> 00:37:41,451
0ut,. Out...

329
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:44,290
You must have given with the ball.

330
00:37:48,064 --> 00:37:50,862
l know before and avoided playing with the Jungle
girls.

331
00:37:54,137 --> 00:37:56,401
You get so much angry?

332
00:37:56,706 --> 00:37:59,800
Looks like you take his head away. Shall l take yours?

333
00:38:14,957 --> 00:38:17,790
Sir, how long are we going to
keep them like this?

334
00:38:19,562 --> 00:38:20,859
l don't know.

335
00:38:22,965 --> 00:38:26,230
l don't think they will all play together.

336
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:31,067
Playing hockey is long way ahead.
Before that we must teach them something else...

337
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:34,274
Good Evening.

338
00:39:13,282 --> 00:39:16,115
Look. New sleeping room.

339
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:18,545
According to the old list.

340
00:39:18,788 --> 00:39:20,187
But the list is no more..

341
00:39:20,323 --> 00:39:22,223
Hey.. Go back to your place.

342
00:39:22,325 --> 00:39:25,817
No girl should stay with a girl from the
same state. Coach has told us.

343
00:39:26,996 --> 00:39:29,055
Let him keep on telling.
l am not changing.

344
00:39:29,165 --> 00:39:32,931
Everyone has changed. lf you have any
problem, talk to the coach.

345
00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:38,668
Whole day sitting on the bench and
at nright also they won't leave us.

346
00:39:39,675 --> 00:39:42,143
They are running a national camp
or a refugee camp.

347
00:39:42,912 --> 00:39:47,042
No. This is also no need.
Let every one sit on the bench.

348
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:53,113
How are you? lt has become big prOhle.
l come here..

349
00:39:53,756 --> 00:39:56,554
But l can't go.
- lts my brother-in-laws sister wedding.

350
00:39:56,959 --> 00:40:00,593
Dad asked me to call you.
- But akesh, you know that this is National Camp.

351
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:04,831
Dear, we come first then playing.

352
00:40:05,034 --> 00:40:08,594
But dad..
- Look we sent you to play there.

353
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:12,500
Now we are asking you to take
the next bus and come back.

354
00:40:14,944 --> 00:40:16,935
akesh, please understand. l can't come.

355
00:40:17,513 --> 00:40:22,712
l have waited my entire life for this camp.
- But vidya, you could wait, I can't.

356
00:40:23,052 --> 00:40:25,521
l can't wait my entire life for you.
Tomorrow is the marriage.

357
00:40:25,522 --> 00:40:28,222
lf you can come, come.
Or else never come back.

358
00:40:28,223 --> 00:40:30,013
Rakesh.

359
00:40:41,337 --> 00:40:45,103
They need wife, children and service.

360
00:40:47,643 --> 00:40:50,271
But l have nothing else apartment
from this Hockey stick.

361
00:40:52,315 --> 00:40:54,010
Are your people also
scared of you?

362
00:40:58,454 --> 00:41:02,220
lf you want to go,
go for one or two days.

363
00:41:03,292 --> 00:41:05,817
But if l go
Ill never come back.

364
00:41:06,596 --> 00:41:08,461
This side or that side.

365
00:41:14,737 --> 00:41:19,674
But before marriage..
- l told everything. They were all happy.

366
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:24,112
l got a flat and government
jOh on sports quota.

367
00:41:26,549 --> 00:41:29,074
Then what happened now?

368
00:41:30,586 --> 00:41:34,022
Now they forget everything
and need me.

369
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:41,991
Sometimes l think this is the
fate for all the players.

370
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:44,224
No.

371
00:41:46,802 --> 00:41:47,598
Every house they play this.

372
00:41:48,604 --> 00:41:52,700
Politics and Cricket can be played.

373
00:41:55,144 --> 00:42:00,138
But Hockey... little bit problem.

374
00:42:03,552 --> 00:42:05,383
Have you ever heard of ohammed Bin Tukluk.

375
00:42:06,422 --> 00:42:07,116
ls he smart?

376
00:42:08,224 --> 00:42:10,283
He was an Emperor long ago.

377
00:42:11,894 --> 00:42:14,556
Everyone tell him mental.
Mentally ill.

378
00:42:16,165 --> 00:42:19,134
He kept all the gold and silver and
showed everyone the bronze.

379
00:42:20,403 --> 00:42:21,631
He was gone within 5 years.

380
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:24,800
very soon the coach
will also go like that.

381
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:26,868
He will do anything.

382
00:42:28,077 --> 00:42:30,637
You have so much brain,
why don't you play the game?

383
00:42:31,113 --> 00:42:32,239
He'll go very soon.

384
00:42:32,815 --> 00:42:34,806
Association people will
throw him out.

385
00:42:35,518 --> 00:42:36,815
Just few days.

386
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:41,950
Tukluk. Nice name. lsn't it?

387
00:42:49,065 --> 00:42:49,656
Mouli,

388
00:42:51,033 --> 00:42:51,624
Balbir

389
00:42:53,336 --> 00:42:53,893
Komal

390
00:42:58,374 --> 00:43:01,537
Brindyalaya. Sit on the bench.

391
00:43:08,584 --> 00:43:11,985
He will keep me on the bench until
l say sorry in front of everyone.

392
00:43:13,122 --> 00:43:15,022
This tukluk is fully becoming mad.

393
00:43:16,158 --> 00:43:18,888
lts ok. We are also mad.

394
00:43:19,695 --> 00:43:21,356
...

395
00:43:22,164 --> 00:43:24,155
Sir... Sir...

396
00:43:30,473 --> 00:43:32,464
Sir, we too want to play.

397
00:43:37,146 --> 00:43:38,408
l am sorry.

398
00:43:43,085 --> 00:43:43,847
Sorry?

399
00:43:47,056 --> 00:43:49,024
l told you sorry.
Lets go.

400
00:44:01,137 --> 00:44:05,267
Sorry. Sorry.. Sorry...

401
00:44:19,889 --> 00:44:24,087
She does a nice stroke.

402
00:44:24,593 --> 00:44:26,390
You are praising your enemy.

403
00:44:38,908 --> 00:44:40,773
Sister, Lets go play...
Sit quitely.

404
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:42,676
We will play only on our position.

405
00:44:50,653 --> 00:44:53,588
l'll go.. lts been 7 days...

406
00:44:56,158 --> 00:44:58,524
Sir, please forgive me.

407
00:45:05,835 --> 00:45:08,429
Hey.. You forgive me or go to the police station.

408
00:45:08,904 --> 00:45:11,202
lf you forgive me our fright will end.

409
00:45:11,474 --> 00:45:14,170
lf there is no fright, then we both will be clear.

410
00:45:14,643 --> 00:45:15,974
No need to go the Police station.

411
00:45:16,145 --> 00:45:18,010
Tell me. Forgive or go the police station?

412
00:45:30,493 --> 00:45:32,586
Lets go...

413
00:45:35,564 --> 00:45:39,660
We are reversing the play.
Defenders will attack and forward will defend.

414
00:45:39,835 --> 00:45:40,893
Sorry sir.

415
00:45:41,637 --> 00:45:42,899
Lets go and back them.

416
00:46:06,028 --> 00:46:08,963
They lost the match with Pakistan
on the world Cup match.

417
00:46:10,032 --> 00:46:11,659
He was the captain for the team, right.

418
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:16,801
Pakistans captain in lndian uniform.

419
00:46:17,573 --> 00:46:21,031
What are you talking?
Not me.. Everyone is talking the same.

420
00:46:21,844 --> 00:46:23,573
Then how come he become coach?

421
00:46:24,113 --> 00:46:25,910
This is lndia.
Anything can happen here.

422
00:46:26,315 --> 00:46:28,180
They were talking about
the world cup.

423
00:46:29,018 --> 00:46:33,352
They are going to send
us to the world cup.

424
00:46:30,686 --> 00:46:33,348
They are going to send
us to the world cup.

425
00:46:38,193 --> 00:46:41,390
What are doing here? Look who has come down.

426
00:46:41,897 --> 00:46:43,057

Abhimanu Singh. What?

429
00:46:47,803 --> 00:46:50,237
You are just kidding. Go.. What?

430
00:46:50,873 --> 00:46:54,172
Lets go see him. He has come to see someone.

432
00:46:56,946 --> 00:46:58,504
Lets go see him.

00:47:22,304 --> 00:47:24,363

435
00:47:35,217 --> 00:47:39,654
Leave until tomorrow morning?
What they will do at nright?

436
00:47:46,395 --> 00:47:50,456

Bullshit.

437
00:47:52,334 --> 00:47:52,925

00:47:53,802 --> 00:47:55,997
Yeah.. l don't believe this.

to
watch and teach all seniors.

441
00:48:04,113 --> 00:48:06,206
Now i can come to know how the team performs.

442
00:48:06,782 --> 00:48:09,615
Get out of the way everyone, its my turn.

443
00:48:12,588 --> 00:48:14,522
Now, you too leave all these things?

What can l do after leaving this?

00:48:31,473 --> 00:48:33,600
Live the life King size with the King.

You are the wife of vice captain
of the lndian Team. - Wife?

451
00:48:38,947 --> 00:48:40,380

452
00:48:42,184 --> 00:48:44,345

453
00:48:45,154 --> 00:48:49,113
l told him l am ready and he
said he will give you to me.

454
00:48:49,324 --> 00:48:51,315

What about my career?

00:48:58,734 --> 00:49:00,998
Yours, which career?

459
00:49:01,336 --> 00:49:03,327
Now l am on the lndian Hockey Team.

460
00:49:03,972 --> 00:49:06,668
Thats not a career Priety.

461
00:49:09,445 --> 00:49:11,106
So as cricket. Priety...

This is result of giving too much
respect to the coach..

How you want to stay

560
00:56:57,646 --> 00:56:59,204
Yes

561
00:57:02,017 --> 00:57:08,013
l have thought about it.. The hockey association has
only the right to decide on how to run the team...

562
00:57:08,223 --> 00:57:15,254
The way the run the team like before or
How Tukluk wants it to be...

563
00:57:22,137 --> 00:57:25,470
Can all girls sign on this petition letter

00:57:34,182 --> 00:57:36,912
Girls please sign here ....

It is a little bit too much, already

569
00:58:09,718 --> 00:58:16,123
They are girls how much can they withstand
The pressure unless they are man .

570
00:58:16,424 --> 00:58:19,325
this is not question of strength
but it is the intention

571
00:58:19,594 --> 00:58:22,757
To play in a team you dont require strengtb
your intention must be good ...

572
00:58:23,365 --> 00:58:27,699
Butsir...
they will treat you like an enemy ..

573
00:58:28,003 --> 00:58:35,967
lf they take me as an enemy, they can be friends
to make a team, it is a very small sacrifice...

574
00:58:51,893 --> 00:58:53,588
Why are you all gathering here?

575
00:58:55,597 --> 00:58:56,655
What's the problem??

576
00:58:58,533 --> 00:59:00,694
The team does not want to practice with you

577
00:59:01,436 --> 00:59:03,028
What nonsense you are telling..

578
00:59:05,774 --> 00:59:07,071
We want to change the coach

579
00:59:07,409 --> 00:59:09,434
l will hit you right and proper

580
00:59:09,544 --> 00:59:13,742
Krishna jee why should we give way
to a person who has sell the country.

581
00:59:14,015 --> 00:59:16,779
Shut up or else I will smack you

582
00:59:24,993 --> 00:59:26,392
7' years

583
00:59:28,363 --> 00:59:30,695
After 7' years i decided to make a come
back to a Hockey team.

584
00:59:31,232 --> 00:59:36,192
The reason why I came back is because l wanted
to win back the glory which I and my team had fail before

585
00:59:38,473 --> 00:59:42,842
But today...
l've lost it again...

586
00:59:44,446 --> 00:59:48,280
l dont have any difficulties

587
00:59:48,983 --> 00:59:56,412
But lts painful that l had to force you
all to play together with one another...

588
00:59:56,725 --> 01:00:04,154
I thaught you all to put the team before
yourself, and also to put lndia before your state..

589
01:00:06,735 --> 01:00:07,827
0k...

590
01:00:10,505 --> 01:00:15,943
You all have won and i've lost...

591
01:00:19,447 --> 01:00:30,221
<i>i have no regrets that i've lost to all of you but
l fell sorry for myself that i have lost to my nation...</i>

592
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:44,767
Even after giving my sweat, blood my heart I can't
believe that l had played with the Team and for life
l will be playing for the team...

593
01:00:48,143 --> 01:00:53,103
l resign as a coach of the state...

594
01:01:45,467 --> 01:01:50,461
Please reconsider your decision..

595
01:01:54,442 --> 01:01:59,402
A good team in the making will be destroyed..

596
01:02:19,234 --> 01:02:23,136
Today in this camp is my last day...

597
01:02:24,572 --> 01:02:28,338
Before I leave
I want to take all staff for lunch..

598
01:02:29,344 --> 01:02:33,747
lf any one of you want's to follow
You may come...

599
01:02:35,116 --> 01:02:38,483
Anyway, it is not important...

608
01:06:16,003 --> 01:06:19,461
Look. ls it a team or an army of evil.

609
01:06:21,476 --> 01:06:26,539
As l said, you don't need the strength
its only the intention to win.

610
01:06:28,683 --> 01:06:31,743
First time, l saw that intention on them.

There is nothing to ask you. You want to marry me.

623
01:11:07,461 --> 01:11:10,760

627
01:11:25,813 --> 01:11:29,613
This is also big for me.
Even bigger than marriage?

628
01:11:30,284 --> 01:11:32,582
l've to go. Good night.

629
01:11:34,455 --> 01:11:42,157
Go and play the Worldcup. lf you lose you'll be my wife.
lf you win also you'll be my wife.

630
01:11:42,696 --> 01:11:48,191
lt'll not like that you come with the world Cup and
you'll be famous all over lndia.

631
01:11:50,137 --> 01:11:56,736
<i>0ne thing l promise you Mr Abhimanu Singb, whatever
will happen or not, this will defenitely happen.</i>

632
01:12:00,114 --> 01:12:04,244
You have made a wonderful team. Yeah...
This team captain will be Vidya.

633
01:12:06,554 --> 01:12:09,148
Congratulations vidya.

634
01:12:20,935 --> 01:12:22,095
He left us.

635
01:12:22,336 --> 01:12:23,735
There is no chance left to talk.

636
01:12:24,004 --> 01:12:27,371
First time something good happens. You must be part
of it. You have become part of it, right?

637
01:12:31,846 --> 01:12:36,783
Bindya is totally upset. lt will be better if we
keep her off the team.

638
01:12:37,184 --> 01:12:38,674
l don't know, Krishna a'am.

639
01:12:39,954 --> 01:12:43,412
And it is not good if we don't
have an experienced player.

640
01:12:43,657 --> 01:12:46,285
We can't strike a deal with her.

641
01:12:48,863 --> 01:12:51,627
Without her we will win the match.

642
01:12:53,434 --> 01:12:55,834
ls this is your world cup silver medal sir?

643
01:12:57,204 --> 01:12:58,865
What are you doing with that?

644
01:13:00,274 --> 01:13:03,038
l'm just trying to find a way to make gold.

645
01:13:04,745 --> 01:13:09,739
lf l sell to the Theif arkt, l'll get the right name.

646
01:13:15,623 --> 01:13:16,817
Kabir sir...

647
01:13:18,592 --> 01:13:21,686
lt'll be better if you forget
about the worldcup.

648
01:13:21,862 --> 01:13:25,229
Tell the girls too that you have
given them false dream.

649
01:13:26,267 --> 01:13:29,600
But our plan is to prepare this
team for the Worldcup.

650
01:13:30,704 --> 01:13:34,663
ls there any paper that we have signed,
so you can hold our neck.

651
01:13:34,842 --> 01:13:37,140
We discussed everything before my presence.

652
01:13:37,645 --> 01:13:39,545
Now also we are talking in your presence.

653
01:13:40,114 --> 01:13:46,349
Look.. At least the Mens team will bring
the Bronze medal.

654
01:13:46,787 --> 01:13:49,415
On the other side he has
got that silly team.

655
01:13:49,623 --> 01:13:52,990
But this team has been is
ready for the Worldcup.

656
01:13:53,394 --> 01:13:58,354
In case this team is ready, do you think we will
send them? This team is not going to worldcup.

657
01:14:02,803 --> 01:14:04,998
Why are you snatching away from them and giving
it to the male counterpart.

658
01:14:06,006 --> 01:14:11,535
You are so talented. Why are you talking about
things which you have no say?

659
01:14:12,813 --> 01:14:13,302
We have to go.

660
01:14:14,815 --> 01:14:15,577
Sir...

661
01:14:17,284 --> 01:14:20,913
Lets arrange for a match.

662
01:14:25,626 --> 01:14:28,459
Match between my team and your team.

663
01:14:29,863 --> 01:14:32,627
l mean, between mens team and womens team?

664
01:14:32,933 --> 01:14:33,558
Yes.

665
01:14:34,401 --> 01:14:36,995
Your team and my team.

666
01:14:39,406 --> 01:14:44,002
lf they lose, they lose... lf they win,
they will go to worldcup.

667
01:14:46,213 --> 01:14:48,408
Think carefully Kabir.

668
01:14:49,116 --> 01:14:53,382
You want to lay a bet?

669
01:14:53,921 --> 01:14:55,548
we have told you before also.

670
01:14:59,293 --> 01:14:59,918
<i>0. K .</i>

671
01:15:00,694 --> 01:15:01,786
Lets have the match on
the day after tomorrow.

672
01:15:03,163 --> 01:15:08,191
At least give them the time to prepare.
Day after tomorrow.  Be there in the morning.

673
01:15:08,402 --> 01:15:11,098
We will meet day after tomorrow
morning on the field.

674
01:15:11,972 --> 01:15:12,961
Lets go...

675
01:15:17,144 --> 01:15:20,910
Sir.. We also need some practice...
Come outside...

676
01:15:33,894 --> 01:15:37,955
First thing we will not win.
Even by fault.. By fault!

677
01:15:39,033 --> 01:15:40,694
By fault also we can't win the match.

678
01:15:42,002 --> 01:15:46,666
Think by how many goals are we going to lose.
Once we lose, they will talk forever.

679
01:15:52,413 --> 01:15:55,405
Why are you putting us into big trouble?

680
01:15:55,582 --> 01:15:55,949
Trouble...

681
01:15:55,949 --> 01:15:56,779
Trouble...

682
01:15:57,851 --> 01:16:03,016
l've all the confidence on the team.
Do you all have the confidence of yourselves?

683
01:16:04,224 --> 01:16:05,987
Come on... Lets go...

684
01:16:09,863 --> 01:16:10,659
Look...

685
01:16:12,132 --> 01:16:17,092
You all are not playing against the Mens wishes.
Come on, Get ready... Lets go...

686
01:16:19,673 --> 01:16:25,737
Don't think that the match is against 1 men.

687
01:16:28,382 --> 01:16:35,345
You must sbow the entire nation that women can
perform better than man.

688
01:16:36,857 --> 01:16:39,291
How good are the men also,
that they don't do work.

689
01:16:40,294 --> 01:16:43,092
They can'teven make simple decision.

690
01:16:44,832 --> 01:16:46,925
Your match is against tbose fools...

691
01:16:47,634 --> 01:16:53,163
They have forgotten, that the women has more power
that they can do anything.

692
01:16:55,442 --> 01:16:57,637
Anything... mmm...

693
01:16:59,546 --> 01:17:02,879
lts such a big match that
it is bigger than you and me.

694
01:17:03,784 --> 01:17:07,743
Thats why l want to tell you all
''Play without fear''

695
01:17:08,255 --> 01:17:10,917
Join bands and play together.

696
01:17:11,592 --> 01:17:16,154
Play with all your strength.. Play like this,
Play like that... But...

697
01:17:18,532 --> 01:17:20,227
l want to say one thing.

698
01:17:25,572 --> 01:17:26,971
Go for it...

699
01:18:22,362 --> 01:18:24,762
Foul... This is foul...

700
01:19:39,273 --> 01:19:42,436
Come on girls.. Well played...

701
01:19:53,854 --> 01:19:59,087
lf it is enough, we can stop the match.
Sir, the match is not yet over.

702
01:19:59,593 --> 01:20:04,656
Your girls can't even reach the mens area.
What they will do? Sir What are you....... Krishna ji...

703
01:20:05,632 --> 01:20:07,429
He is telling the truth.

704
01:20:08,201 --> 01:20:13,161
We already told you, where this indian women wearing
these shorts can play the match.

705
01:20:13,607 --> 01:20:15,472
where? You ask them?

706
01:20:15,642 --> 01:20:17,633
What can you do? What will you do?

707
01:20:23,584 --> 01:20:25,779
Sir, You had a big fall?

708
01:20:25,953 --> 01:20:27,944
Can you get up? or you need the girls for assitance?

709
01:21:31,685 --> 01:21:34,449
Well done sister... Well done..

710
01:23:37,144 --> 01:23:40,409
You all played very well.. Good defence...

711
01:23:41,081 --> 01:23:43,606
Well played girls...

712
01:25:12,472 --> 01:25:18,707
Where should we send them to?
Oh.. Them.. Yeah...

713
01:25:23,850 --> 01:25:25,545
Send them.

714
01:25:25,752 --> 01:25:30,746
Yes.. Yes... Kabir.
World Championship. Yes...

715
01:29:21,921 --> 01:29:25,118
Greetings. l'm Kapil varma welcomes you.

716
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:34,893
We are at the elbourne's Hockey Center and the first
match is between lndia and times world champions Australia.

717
01:29:35,835 --> 01:29:37,666
Both teams are infrontof each other.

718
01:29:38,204 --> 01:29:42,072
Australian team look like true champions.

719
01:29:56,623 --> 01:30:02,687
Coach Kabir Khan with his contingent of players.

720
01:30:07,634 --> 01:30:12,594
For the excitement of Audience,
the match is about to start.

721
01:30:36,062 --> 01:30:39,862
Within the first minute Australia
got their firstgoal.

722
01:31:24,143 --> 01:31:27,476
What are you doing? She will get the Card.

723
01:31:35,355 --> 01:31:41,988
Balbir Kaur got an Yellow Card and the Australia got
a Penalty Corner which is dangerous for lndia.

724
01:31:47,433 --> 01:31:50,664
Did you see, how rude She was?
lts not her... lts you...

725
01:31:51,371 --> 01:31:53,931
No point in that. Give her some water.

726
01:32:29,275 --> 01:32:34,235
Coach Kabir Khans lastchance to save
the match by replacing one player.

727
01:32:47,193 --> 01:32:54,998
Sister.. Sister... Where should l pass?
Why are you asking me? Ask your Captain.

728
01:33:42,215 --> 01:33:47,653
Komal.. Pass it on to me..
What are you doing?

729
01:34:03,536 --> 01:34:05,800
This is the whole lndian Sickness...

730
01:34:32,265 --> 01:34:39,967
Because of the confusion, australia
got another Penalty Corner.

731
01:34:56,055 --> 01:34:59,491
Match is over. Autralia 7, lndia 0.

732
01:34:59,592 --> 01:35:01,992
This is very shameful for lndia.

733
01:36:03,756 --> 01:36:08,386
Bindya.. Bindya...

734
01:36:09,662 --> 01:36:13,928
What were you doing? Me.. Where?
What were you doing on the field?

735
01:36:14,534 --> 01:36:15,432
Nothing.

736
01:36:15,835 --> 01:36:18,702
From now on, you will not play
the World Cup Match.

737
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:22,232
Whats so great about her?

738
01:36:27,713 --> 01:36:29,010
What?

739
01:36:29,782 --> 01:36:32,774
What is great she has
that l don't have?

740
01:36:33,152 --> 01:36:34,016
who?

741
01:36:34,754 --> 01:36:36,847
Your Captain, sir.

742
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:45,357
Since we have come so far on this issue,
lets talk freely.

743
01:36:48,734 --> 01:36:53,000
There are no kids here.
Neither you nor me.

744
01:36:56,075 --> 01:36:58,600
Whatever she can do for becoming captain,
l can also do the same.

745
01:37:02,715 --> 01:37:04,546
Much more than that.

746
01:37:07,153 --> 01:37:08,745
Now tell me sir...

747
01:37:09,522 --> 01:37:11,217
Why can't l be a captain?

748
01:37:22,134 --> 01:37:24,295
You have given the answer by yourself.

749
01:38:49,922 --> 01:38:55,883
After the first match thrashing by Australia, lndias
chance of surviving in the tournament, looks very slim.

750
01:38:56,295 --> 01:39:00,026
The only chance they have is to beat England
in tomorrows match.

751
01:39:00,533 --> 01:39:05,493
Looking at their team form, there is no
hope for them to win the match.

752
01:39:23,622 --> 01:39:37,593
You all must keep on
passing to one another.

753
01:39:42,975 --> 01:39:48,811
You've got 2o more minutes for practice.

754
01:40:09,101 --> 01:40:14,562
Welcome to Melbourne. ln today's England
from Group A playing with 2 points.

755
01:40:14,974 --> 01:40:19,240
But lndia must win to save their hope
to be in the Worldcup Tournment.

756
01:40:24,884 --> 01:40:30,823
The English has challenged, they will score
more goals than Australia.

757
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:35,286
Thats why, there is not enough audience on the
stadium.

758
01:41:15,334 --> 01:41:21,170
lndian players got better coordination than the
previous match. But Englands forward is still attacking.

759
01:41:57,843 --> 01:42:05,079
0nly 2o minutes left in the 1st balf. England has got a
Penalty corner and its a danger for lndia.

760
01:42:20,332 --> 01:42:25,292
This time, lndia make no mistake.

761
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:40,944
Second half begins, against all the odds lndia
has  not conceded any goals.

762
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:16,644
Well done.. Well done...

763
01:44:00,032 --> 01:44:06,961
Oh.. Unbelievable Goal...

764
01:44:12,945 --> 01:44:21,410
Chautala set the ball for Priety. Long live..
Preity Long Live...

765
01:44:34,233 --> 01:44:39,227
Last 20 seconds of the match...

766
01:44:49,114 --> 01:45:01,493
Without anyones expectation, lndia won the match
and kept alive the chance to be in the tournament.

767
01:45:10,469 --> 01:45:15,463
Well done.. Well done...

768
01:45:24,283 --> 01:45:29,721
We don't know what will happen next,
but lndia has survived.

769
01:46:43,962 --> 01:46:48,956
Sister.. Water please?
You want me to give you a glass?

770
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:14,589
Priety going ahead. Komal, don't let her go ahead.
Take your revenge on the next match.

771
01:47:29,341 --> 01:47:37,646
Coach Kabir Khan's lndia team has surprised everyone
by going
top of the table in the tournament.

772
01:47:37,883 --> 01:47:46,621
lf they win the Quarter Finals, they will
advance to the semi final. lf not they are out.

773
01:47:46,992 --> 01:47:54,922
Tomorrows clash is against Argentina, a team
that plays very rough and tough and they
had injured many players in the tournament.

774
01:48:42,514 --> 01:48:46,177
Take water and clean the wounds.

775
01:48:47,252 --> 01:48:49,311
From this second, ball must be in our bands.

776
01:48:49,521 --> 01:48:54,288
Balbir, you play your game.
Sir, l will crush them. Then you break them.

777
01:48:54,593 --> 01:48:58,461
lf they beat two, you beat 4 of them.
lf they beat 4, you beat 8 or 9 of them.

778
01:48:58,563 --> 01:48:59,860
Beat them nicely so that they must be scared of
holding the hockey stick.

779
01:49:00,165 --> 01:49:03,999
lf anyone of them and block the way of Komal and
Preity they should dare to come again.

780
01:49:04,169 --> 01:49:05,295
We will attack.

781
01:49:05,404 --> 01:49:08,737
Keep on attacking until they
are broken or we.

782
01:50:00,125 --> 01:50:05,085
Coach Kabir Khan's lndian team has
entered into the semi finals.

783
01:50:10,902 --> 01:50:16,465
Now lndian team will be meeting Korea.
So far, no team scored against them.

784
01:50:16,775 --> 01:50:18,709
Man to man marking?

785
01:50:19,644 --> 01:50:24,274
Behind every opponent they keep their players.
thats is their style of game.

786
01:50:25,484 --> 01:50:28,351
lf it is like that, we can't even move also. Forget
our playing the game.

787
01:50:29,020 --> 01:50:31,113
lf they play like this, who will be able to break them.

788
01:50:35,894 --> 01:50:37,452
There is one player.

789
01:50:46,805 --> 01:50:48,568
what you say is true?

790
01:50:49,174 --> 01:50:51,540
You have something extra ordinary
thats something She doesn't have.

791
01:50:52,744 --> 01:50:55,508
Even others in the team don't have that.

792
01:51:09,294 --> 01:51:10,522
Take this.

793
01:51:17,803 --> 01:51:19,100
Why?

794
01:51:22,741 --> 01:51:26,939
At this moment, lndia needs such an
experienced player like you.

795
01:51:29,614 --> 01:51:34,108
Only you know how to break the
man to man markings.

796
01:51:35,053 --> 01:51:40,423
The match is about to start.
Go and break them.

797
01:51:45,130 --> 01:51:50,898
As expected, korean team kept their players atevery
indian forward position to lock them up.

798
01:51:51,303 --> 01:51:56,036
Komal, Preity, Haliya Bose three of them can't move
forward.

799
01:52:02,113 --> 01:52:05,640
Substitution. No.5 Bindya Nayak come to the field.

800
01:52:09,054 --> 01:52:14,014
Suddenly the lndian team changed the game totaly.

801
01:52:17,529 --> 01:52:25,800
lndian defenders moving forwad and started attacking
which has confused the Koreans.

802
01:52:30,175 --> 01:52:33,804
lts a Goal...

803
01:52:52,364 --> 01:52:57,358
lndia enters into the worldcup final.

804
01:52:58,169 --> 01:53:03,163
From the condition of the stadium you may guess
the feelings of the lndian National Team.

805
01:53:03,375 --> 01:53:11,180
and also the feeling of the coach

806
01:53:08,179 --> 01:53:11,171
few months ago the indian sports authorities
refused to send them to the world cup.

807
01:53:11,783 --> 01:53:20,191
Who knows the bestcentre forward of india can
make such an impact in this semifinal.

808
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:26,020
You are the one who can get high scorer
of the world championsbip trophy.

809
01:54:27,759 --> 01:54:34,597
How can it be like that? Komal scored 8 Goals and
moving ahead.

810
01:54:36,534 --> 01:54:40,664
You all having your own worldcup championship or
what?

811
01:54:41,139 --> 01:54:45,803
Hello.. Mr. Sukhlal, please speak little bit louder.

812
01:54:45,944 --> 01:54:48,105
Sister, you have done magic.

813
01:54:48,313 --> 01:54:54,149
The team has done wonders. Your
blessings always with the girls.

814
01:54:54,452 --> 01:54:59,617
Sister, that amleela group has come here. l told them
clearly that this is lndian Women Hockey Team's ground.

815
01:55:00,125 --> 01:55:06,257
We are waiting for our team. We won't give to
anyone else. Only Hockey practised in here.

816
01:55:06,931 --> 01:55:09,024
Mr. Sukblal, please talk to them.

817
01:55:09,234 --> 01:55:21,112
r. Sukhlal, we always rememher your curd rice. You
bring the world cup and i'll make curd rice for the rest
of your life

818
01:55:21,713 --> 01:55:31,281
<i>Please don't lose.. Don't lose... No r.Sukhlal, we'll
come back dead but we will not lose the world cup.</i>

819
01:55:51,042 --> 01:55:54,102
Sir, what are you doing here?

820
01:55:56,381 --> 01:55:57,405
Look at that.

821
01:55:59,184 --> 01:56:09,992
First time l'm looking at an Englishman bringing
up the lndian flag. We have come to the final
and its not a dream.

822
01:56:11,463 --> 01:56:14,796
What do you feel? lt must be a dream.

823
01:56:17,202 --> 01:56:19,170
lts also a dream for you, right.

824
01:56:36,154 --> 01:56:40,022
Today is an official reception nright for both the
finalists.

825
01:56:40,225 --> 01:56:46,130
lnternational Hockey Federation is
hosting tonrights reception.

826
01:56:46,865 --> 01:56:53,930
Tonight they will forget of winning or losing in
tomorrows final to show the world the true
spirit of sportsmanship.

827
01:57:48,359 --> 01:57:49,883
ls it necessary to wear this saree?

828
01:57:50,395 --> 01:57:52,761
l'll thrown water to save you from bad luck.

829
01:58:01,172 --> 01:58:03,265
Nethra? What is that?
Sir is calling her.

830
01:58:05,343 --> 01:58:06,207
What is it?

831
01:58:07,912 --> 01:58:08,606
You mean...

832
01:58:09,013 --> 01:58:10,207
Why did you call me here?

833
01:58:10,548 --> 01:58:11,139
Me?

834
01:58:11,549 --> 01:58:12,675
lts you who called me.

835
01:58:12,951 --> 01:58:15,010
Am l crazy to call you here.

836
01:58:15,553 --> 01:58:16,520
l called you all...

837
01:58:19,090 --> 01:58:19,419
ls that you?

838
01:58:20,625 --> 01:58:22,252
Why did you call us?

839
01:58:23,494 --> 01:58:28,727
To inform you that we lose
tomorrow's match.

840
01:58:31,102 --> 01:58:32,467
Why?

841
01:58:33,705 --> 01:58:40,008
Because, two of our players
will make Australia to win.

842
01:58:43,414 --> 01:58:48,317
No sir, Nothing like that. What do you think?
Australian coach or players are stupid?

843
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:53,420
Can't you feel that they knew two of our farward
players do not pass the ball to each other.

844
01:58:54,192 --> 01:58:57,355
What do you think?
Won't they take advantage of it?

845
01:58:58,529 --> 01:59:01,089
l don't know about her, but l'm with
the team. - Komal...

846
01:59:02,333 --> 01:59:06,099
She also can't cheat you. Atleast
you don't cheat yourself.

847
01:59:06,704 --> 01:59:10,834
You left your family and come
to delbi to play Hockey.

848
01:59:11,242 --> 01:59:14,905
But you are playing
something else.

849
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:19,075
She was the one who started first.
- And you finish it on tomorrow's match.

850
01:59:20,285 --> 01:59:22,549
Hey, ls this your plan?

851
01:59:27,492 --> 01:59:28,288
And you...

852
01:59:29,961 --> 01:59:31,053
Preity Sabarwal.

853
01:59:33,765 --> 01:59:36,199
Captain of Chandigarh team

854
01:59:37,368 --> 01:59:39,893
You was fainted when you wanted
to come into the team.

855
01:59:41,639 --> 01:59:45,097
But now you have lost
all your sense? Why?

856
01:59:49,013 --> 01:59:50,275
You are all not a child.

857
01:59:51,049 --> 01:59:56,043
You know very well that, if you both don't play together we will lose the match.

858
01:59:58,823 --> 02:00:02,987
The same thing happened to an lndian team at
the final that they have lost the match.

859
02:00:04,963 --> 02:00:07,830
How heavy is the burdon of the lose?

860
02:00:09,434 --> 02:00:11,368
You will not be able to understand.

861
02:00:11,803 --> 02:00:12,667
But when you understand

862
02:00:14,339 --> 02:00:15,772
You can't take it.

863
02:00:16,674 --> 02:00:18,539
Both of you don't have the strength.

864
02:00:19,944 --> 02:00:21,502
And no one else has that kind of strength.

865
02:00:24,015 --> 02:00:26,279
You both knew whats the problem between you.

866
02:00:26,684 --> 02:00:29,653
l only know that whether you
play together or not...

867
02:00:30,588 --> 02:00:34,183
.. the restof the team will fight
together with australia.

868
02:00:34,325 --> 02:00:36,691
lf necessary they will also
go against you.

869
02:00:38,663 --> 02:00:43,225
Now both of you will play
together with the team.

870
02:00:46,204 --> 02:00:48,069
Or against your team.

871
02:00:55,613 --> 02:00:59,572
Whatever happens,
l'll be the leading scorer.

872
02:00:59,684 --> 02:01:01,618
So, What do you want
to show me?

873
02:01:01,753 --> 02:01:03,653
l am not showing it to you.

874
02:01:04,922 --> 02:01:08,085
l want to show to a man, what a woman can do.

875
02:01:08,493 --> 02:01:10,927
l'll be the leading scorer.

876
02:01:15,299 --> 02:01:17,324
l'll see how it will happen.

877
02:01:37,789 --> 02:01:40,883
The night has come for which
we all have been eagerly waiting for.

878
02:01:41,292 --> 02:01:44,056
Tonright is the Womens Hockey
World Championship final.

879
02:01:44,295 --> 02:01:48,994
0ne month before no one could have predicted
that such a final would happen.

880
02:01:49,434 --> 02:01:57,842
Because current and times world champion team
Australia will clash with a team that has come as a
wonder...

881
02:01:58,309 --> 02:02:02,109
and that team has captured heart of the
people with their performance..

882
02:02:02,413 --> 02:02:05,871
A lot of difference between winning peoples
hearts and winning the world cup championship.

883
02:02:06,284 --> 02:02:09,742
This is coach Kabir Khans team's biggest test.

884
02:02:10,054 --> 02:02:13,217
ln today's final test what would
be Coach Kabir Khan's strategy.

885
02:02:13,858 --> 02:02:16,349
will it be a magic or dream?

886
02:02:16,794 --> 02:02:21,788
How could the lndian team going to win
against 6 times world cup winner

887
02:02:54,632 --> 02:02:59,569
70 minutes. You only have 70 minutes.

888
02:03:00,771 --> 02:03:06,038
May be this 70 minutes is
something special in your life.

889
02:03:07,178 --> 02:03:13,674
Today you play well or lousy, you will rememher
this 70 minutes for the rest of your life

890
02:03:15,319 --> 02:03:19,221
l'm not going to say how you
are going to play today.

891
02:03:21,092 --> 02:03:22,992
l'll only say this.

892
02:03:24,061 --> 02:03:29,021
You make most out of this 70 minutes.

893
02:03:31,002 --> 02:03:46,145
ln outside world you may succeed or you fail, you win
or lose this tournament, nobody can take away that 70 minutes
from you.

894
02:03:47,285 --> 02:03:48,445
Nobody.

895
02:03:54,192 --> 02:04:01,325
l've thought that l'll not tell you how to play this match
but you are going to tell me how are you all going to play.

896
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:03,628
By playing...

897
02:04:04,669 --> 02:04:13,509
Because l know in this 70 minutes, if everyone
plays hockey to the best of their life...

898
02:04:14,278 --> 02:04:18,078
.. then this 70 minutes,
god also not ask you back.

899
02:04:25,690 --> 02:04:29,227
Go by yourselves in this life,

900
02:04:29,228 --> 02:04:34,228
from your god, and also to the person who
 did not trust you take that 70 minutes.

901
02:05:55,012 --> 02:05:58,215
lndian team has showed everyone at 
the first minute of this match...

902
02:05:58,216 --> 02:06:01,316
that they will not play like any 
other underdogs team.

903
02:06:06,824 --> 02:06:10,694
lts very important to score the first 
goal to keep the moral

904
02:06:10,695 --> 02:06:13,695
of the team, which is very clear on 
the face of lndian coach.

905
02:06:21,539 --> 02:06:24,064
Australia counter attacks.

906
02:06:38,422 --> 02:06:44,327
Australia is notan easy team to give up, they will put
pressure which will be uneasy for indian team.

907
02:09:26,790 --> 02:09:32,353
Preity... 
Go and show it to the man...

908
02:11:07,124 --> 02:11:08,352
End of Extra time.

909
02:11:08,592 --> 02:11:13,529
We can see the smile on lndian camp because 
they brought australia in this tie-breaker.

910
02:11:14,064 --> 02:11:21,368
Now there is a genuine chance for lndia 
to win this match by penalties.

911
02:11:21,972 --> 02:11:27,342
l am reminding you that both team will be 
taking 5 penalty strokes.

912
02:11:27,711 --> 02:11:31,169
Whichever team scores the most, they will
 be crowned as World Champion.

913
02:11:32,583 --> 02:11:37,486
Preity, Bindiya, arry, Nethra 
come.. Quick...

914
02:11:37,755 --> 02:11:39,723
When you take the penalty, 
rememher one thing.

915
02:11:40,591 --> 02:11:43,924
lnstead of concentrating on the goal post, 
you have to read the goal keepers mind. 
The Goal will come by itself.

916
02:11:44,695 --> 02:11:46,925
Come on girls... Well done..

917
02:11:47,064 --> 02:11:49,430
Sir, l want Komal to take my stroke.

918
02:11:52,770 --> 02:11:54,931
Komal.. Come on.. Quick.

919
02:11:57,708 --> 02:12:00,233
Preity wish that you take her stroke.

920
02:12:20,164 --> 02:12:24,794
lndian Teams first stroke is taken by
 Nethra eddy from Andhra Pradesh.

921
02:12:48,492 --> 02:12:50,653
lndia missed the first chance.

922
02:12:55,132 --> 02:12:58,101
ln this shootout, every stroke is very crucial.

923
02:13:02,639 --> 02:13:07,838
This is Australias turn to take the first penalty against
the lndian
Goal keeper vidya Sharma.

924
02:13:27,431 --> 02:13:32,391
The short was very fast. No chance for the 
goal keeper to save the goal.

925
02:13:45,282 --> 02:13:46,442
Haliya Bose.

926
02:13:54,091 --> 02:13:56,889
Second penalty miss for lndia.

927
02:13:57,861 --> 02:14:00,853
The gap has become wide and 
their hope looks slim.

928
02:14:14,812 --> 02:14:18,304
0ne more goal... Australia 
lead is getting higher.

929
02:14:22,452 --> 02:14:26,411
lf lndia wants to stay they can't afford 
to lose even single stroke.

930
02:14:26,723 --> 02:14:28,657
And they have to stop the penalties 
by australian side.

931
02:14:31,161 --> 02:14:34,153
Komal Chauttala is coming to take the stroke.

932
02:14:37,367 --> 02:14:42,361
Komal is Haryana teams Center Forward 
and lndian teams right band.

933
02:14:57,254 --> 02:14:59,779
lts Goal...

934
02:15:15,772 --> 02:15:17,865
Vidya Sharma is ready to stop the stroke.

935
02:15:20,244 --> 02:15:21,905
Raechal Taylor is ready.

936
02:15:22,479 --> 02:15:24,606
There no chance for mistakes.

937
02:15:53,710 --> 02:15:59,376
They can't afford to miss any of the two strokes.

938
02:16:00,851 --> 02:16:05,720
lndia's nextstriker Marry alte is a
 penalty shootoutspecialist.

939
02:16:17,334 --> 02:16:19,302
lndia and Australia are now equal.

940
02:16:21,071 --> 02:16:25,804
Now australia has two strokes and
 india has got 1 stroke.

941
02:16:48,632 --> 02:16:50,623
lndias last chance.

942
02:16:50,901 --> 02:16:56,965
lts very important to score thats why lndias well
experienced senior player Bindya Nayak has come
to take the stroke.

943
02:17:15,492 --> 02:17:18,290
This is what you call an experience player.

944
02:17:25,369 --> 02:17:27,997
Not its the last stroke of this penalty sbootout.

945
02:17:28,405 --> 02:17:32,000
lf australia takes this penalty properly, 
this shootout will continue.

946
02:17:32,743 --> 02:17:37,737
lf vidya saves this stroke, 
this team will be on the lndian history.

947
02:18:07,944 --> 02:18:11,311
She will shoot the ball on to the left.

948
02:18:12,049 --> 02:18:15,849
But her foot is on the right side and she can
shoot the ball onto the rightside.

949
02:18:20,323 --> 02:18:23,292
l think she will take the centre shot.

950
02:18:23,860 --> 02:18:27,694
Vidya.. Look at me...

951
02:20:24,514 --> 02:20:34,754
