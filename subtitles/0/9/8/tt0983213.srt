1
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,080
Hey...

2
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,880
They say it's five centimeters per second.

3
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,420
Huh? What is?

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,030
The speed at which cherry blossoms fall.
It's five centimeters per second.

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,330
You sure know a lot of stuff like that, Akari.

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,820
Say... don't you think it kinda looks like snow?

7
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:33,280
I guess...

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,490
Hey! Wait up!

9
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,090
Akari!

10
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:46,970
Takaki-kun!

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,720
It'd be great if we could watch the cherry
blossoms fall again together next year.

12
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,640
"To Thono Takaki-sama. "

13
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,270
"It's been a really long time. "

14
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,860
"Summer's pretty hot around here,
but compared to Tokyo, it's so much milder. "

15
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,910
"But when I think about it,
I liked Tokyo's hot, humid summers, too. "

16
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:30,540
"The melting-hot asphalt,"

17
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,930
"the distant skyscrapers, shimmering in the heat,"

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,460
"and the freezing air-conditioning
in department stores and on subways. "

19
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,350
"The last time we were together was at
our elementary school graduation. "

20
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,350
"It's already been half a year since. "

21
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,160
"So, Takaki-kun... "

22
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,890
"... do you still remember me?."

23
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,210
"Dear Takaki-kun... "

24
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,910
"Thanks for replying. "

25
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,500
"It made me so happy. "

26
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,710
"It's already well into autumn and the
leaves are turning beautiful colors. "

27
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,380
"I had to pull out a sweater the day before
yesterday for the first time this year. "

28
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:10,970
Tohno-kun.

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,010
Senpai.

30
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,010
What's that? A love letter?

31
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,240
That's not it.

32
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,090
Sorry for having asked you to do all that.

33
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,425
No problem, I finished quickly.

34
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,170
Thanks. So, is it true
that you'll be transferring schools?

35
00:02:21,205 --> 00:02:23,360
Ah, yes, at the end of the year.

36
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,290
Where to?

37
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,725
Kagoshima. Because of my parents.

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,725
I see... it'll be lonely around here without you.

39
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,310
"I'm actually writing this letter on the train because
practice has been starting really early lately. "

40
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,590
"I had my hair cut the other day. "

41
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,000
"It's so short you can even see my ears... "

42
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,360
"... so you probably wouldn't even recognize me
if you saw me. "

43
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,160
I'm back.

44
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,170
Welcome home.

45
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,990
"I bet you're changing little
by little too, Takaki-kun. "

46
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,700
"Dear Takaki-kun... "

47
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,390
"Have you been doing well during these cold days?"

48
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,820
"It's already snowed a number of times here. "

49
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,260
"Every time it does, I wrap myself
in layers of clothes when I go to school. "

50
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,870
"It hasn't snowed in Tokyo yet, right?."

51
00:03:33,905 --> 00:03:36,120
"Even though I moved away... "

52
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,510
"... I still look at Tokyo's
weather forecast out of habit. "

53
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,630
Wish it would rain one of these days...

54
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:47,630
It wouldn't be any better indoors.

55
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,090
Say... have you guys ever been to Tochigi?

56
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,220
Huh? Where?

57
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,010
Tochigi.

58
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:53,870
Nope.

59
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,730
I wonder how you get there...

60
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:56,890
No clue.

61
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,810
A bullet train or something?

62
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,200
It's a long way...

63
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,530
Freshmen!

64
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,150
Yes?!

65
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,430
Onto the final three laps! Fight! Fight!

66
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,320
"I was surprised to hear that you were
the one transferring schools this time. "

67
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,340
"We both got used to transferring schools
when we were little.. "

68
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,120
"But still... Kagoshima.
That's kind of far away, isn't it?"

69
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,750
"It's no longer a distance where I can just
jump on a train and see you whenever I want... "

70
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:33,130
"So... I guess... that makes me feel a little lonely. "

71
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,010
"Please be well, Takaki-kun. "

72
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,920
"Dear Takaki-kun... "

73
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,690
"I'm so happy we'll see each other on March 4th. "

74
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,540
"It'll be just about a year
since we last met, won't it?"

75
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,000
"For some reason, I feel kind of nervous. "

76
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,850
"There's a really large cherry tree close to
my house, so I bet that in the spring... "

77
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,580
"... the petals will fall
at five centimeters per second. "

78
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,600
"I'm really hoping the spring
will come with you that day, Takaki-kun. "

79
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,170
Wanna stop somewhere on the way home?

80
00:05:48,205 --> 00:05:49,750
Well... it's raining out.

81
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,040
The forecast said it's supposed
to turn to snow by tonight.

82
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,100
Really? I thought it felt cold.

83
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,010
And we're already in March...

84
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,590
Yeah, it feels like I'm gonna catch a cold.

85
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,800
We can get off at Shimokita.

86
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,010
Yeah.

87
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,110
Tohno, let's get to practice.

88
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:05,880
Right...

89
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,690
About that... I don't think I can make it today.

90
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:11,892
Getting ready to move?

91
00:06:11,927 --> 00:06:13,060
Something like that.

92
00:06:13,095 --> 00:06:13,910
Sorry.

93
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,540
"I'm glad you're coming all the way out
to the station closest to me... "

94
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,520
"... but it's a long trip, so please be careful. "

95
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,160
"I'll be waiting for you in the station's
waiting room at 7:00 that night. "

96
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:50,810
<i>On the day Akari and I were to meet,
the rain turned to snow in the afternoon.</i>

97
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,430
Hey, Takaki-kun.

98
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,480
It's that cat, Chobi.

99
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,860
He's always lying here.

100
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,900
But it looks like he's all by himself today.

101
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,610
What happened to your friend Mimi?
It must be lonely all by yourself, huh?

102
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,880
How's that book so far?

103
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,170
I really like it.

104
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,590
Last night I read four billion years' worth of evolution.

105
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,560
Where are you at now?

106
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,550
Just about when the Anomalocaris start showing up.

107
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,550
The Cambrian era!

108
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,600
I really like the Hallucigenia. They look like this!

109
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,170
Yeah, something like that...

110
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,810
Which one do you like, Takaki-kun?

111
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,525
The Opabinia, maybe?

112
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,615
The five-eyed one, right?

113
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,800
<i>I think Akari and I were a lot alike somehow.</i>

114
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:43,450
<i>Exactly one year after I transferred to Tokyo...</i>

115
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,450
A new friend just transferred to our school.
This is Tohno Takaki-kun.

116
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:46,725
<i>...Akari transferred into my class.</i>

117
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,920
Starting today, Shinohara Akari-san
will be joining our class.

118
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,665
<i>Because our bodies were still small,
frail, and prone to illness...</i>

119
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,580
<i>...the two of us preferred the library
over playing on the sportsfield.</i>

120
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,950
<i>Naturally, we became friends...</i>

121
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,840
<i>...and because of that, there were times when
our classmates would tease us. But...</i>

122
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:01,295
I feel kinda bad for her.

123
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,410
Those two are always together.

124
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,605
Ooh! There he is!

125
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,720
<i>As long as we were both together,
strangely, things like that didn't scare us.</i>

126
00:08:10,755 --> 00:08:12,200
Aw, what a nice guy!

127
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,290
Wow!

128
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,770
<i>And yet, for some reason, I thought we'd
end up going to the same middle school...</i>

129
00:08:18,805 --> 00:08:20,900
<i>...and stay together, just as we were...</i>

130
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,190
<i>...from that point on.</i>

131
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,020
Shinjuku, Shinjuku, last stop. For passengers which...

132
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,490
...JR Line, Heiou Line, subway...

133
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:45,095
<i>It was the first time I'd gone
to Shinjuku Station alone...</i>

134
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,240
<i>...and all the lines I would soon be riding
would also be firsts for me.</i>

135
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,930
<i>My heart was pounding.</i>

136
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,390
<i>I was going to see Akari again.</i>

137
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,700
How did it go with that guy?

138
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,490
Who?

139
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,125
You know, that Nisshou boy.

140
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,105
Are you kidding? His tastes were a little gross...

141
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,110
We will be arriving at Musashi-Urawa shortly.
Again, this is Musashi-Urawa.

142
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,020
At our next stop, Musashi-Urawa,
in order to connect with the express train...

143
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,330
In order to connect with the express train,
this train will be stopping for 4 minutes.

144
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,270
Those passengers who wish to quickly reach Yonohonmachi
and Oomiya please board...

145
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,320
Um... this is Shinohara.

146
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,570
Umm, is Takaki-kun there?

147
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,540
It's Akari-chan.

148
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,080
Huh? You're transferring schools?

149
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,120
What about Nishi Middle School?
You went through all that trouble to get accepted.

150
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,620
They said they'd handle the paperwork of transferring
me to the public school in Tochigi...

151
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,450
I'm sorry...

152
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,510
No... there's no reason to apologize.

153
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,140
I told them I still wanted to go
from my aunt's house in Katsushika, but...

154
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,030
...they said I couldn't until I was older.

155
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,660
I understand... you don't have to say anything else.

156
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,440
That's enough.

157
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,990
I'm sorry...

158
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,700
<i>Through the receiver painfully pressed
against my ear...</i>

159
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,410
<i>...Akari's own pain was palpable.</i>

160
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,340
<i>But... there was nothing I could do.</i>

161
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,220
That was pretty good, huh?

162
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,175
Yeah. See you later!

163
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:01,510
<i>The terminal I transferred at
was crowded with people heading home...</i>

164
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,010
<i>...and everyone's shoes were soaked from the snow.</i>

165
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:10,180
<i>The frigid air was saturated with the classic smell
of a snowy city day.</i>

166
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,340
All passengers, your attention please.

167
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,160
Due to the snowy weather conditions, the Utsunomiya Line
outbound trains traveling to Oomiya and Utsunomiya...

168
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:19,350
...will be experiencing an 8 minute delay in arrival.

169
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,385
We apologize for any inconvenience in your busy day.

170
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:28,410
Until that moment, I hadn't even considered
the possibility of one of my trains being late.

171
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,960
<i>My creeping anxiety suddenly became much greater.</i>

172
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:41,040
This train is currently running 10 minutes late
due to the snowy weather conditions.

173
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,550
We apologize for any inconvenience in your busy day.

174
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,220
<i>After we had passed a little beyond Oomiya Station...</i>

175
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,890
<i>...almost all the passing buildings
suddenly vanished from view.</i>

176
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,580
Next stop is Kuki. Kuki.

177
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,540
We apologize for our terribly late arrival.

178
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,390
Those passengers transferring to the Tobu Isesaki Line,
please make your way around to Exit #5.

179
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:25,910
Due to the next train's delay, this train will be stopping
at this station for the next 10 minutes.

180
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:32,200
We apologize for any inconvenience in your busy day,
and appreciate your understanding.

181
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,480
Sorry about that.

182
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,650
Due to the next train's delay, this train will be stopping
at this station for the next 10 minutes.

183
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,840
We apologize for any inconvenience in your busy day, and...

184
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,560
This is Nogi. Nogi.

185
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,185
To all passengers, we express our deepest apologies.

186
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,610
Due to the continuing delay of the following train, this train will
be stopping at this station for an extended period of time.

187
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:22,130
We apologize for any inconvenience in your busy day,
and appreciate your understanding.

188
00:13:22,165 --> 00:13:22,165
<i>The stations seemed unbelievably far apart...</i>

189
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:27,320
<i>...and the train would stop for an unbelievably
long amount of time at each station.</i>

190
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,835
Kurihashi > Koga > Nogi > Mamada > Oyama

191
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:37,040
Omoigawa > Tochigi > Ohirashita > Iwafune > Sano

192
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:52,580
<i>The wilderness on the other side of the
window seemed like nothing I'd ever experienced before.</i>

193
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,810
<i>The slowly ticking time...</i>

194
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,720
<i>...and my pangs of hunger...</i>

195
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,770
<i>...continued to dampen my spirits.</i>

196
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,130
<i>The time we had planned to meet had passed...</i>

197
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,250
<i>...so I had the feeling that Akari was beginning to worry.</i>

198
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,240
<i>On that day...</i>

199
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,510
<i>...the day she called...</i>

200
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:24,330
<i>...Akari must've been so much more jittery and upset than me,
yet I couldn't find the words to console her.</i>

201
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:26,460
<i>I felt so ashamed of myself.</i>

202
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:37,670
<i>As we look back, we thank our teachers
for all they've done.</i>

203
00:14:37,705 --> 00:14:37,880
Then I guess after today... this is goodbye.

204
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,440
Any summer vacation plans?

205
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,380
<i>I received the first letter from Akari
half a year later...</i>

206
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,060
<i>...during the summer of my first year of middle school.</i>

207
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,290
<i>I remember every last word of it.</i>

208
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,940
<i>Over the two weeks before the day we were to meet...</i>

209
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,790
<i>...I spent my time writing a letter I would give her.</i>

210
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,470
<i>It was filled with all the things I had to tell her.</i>

211
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,770
<i>All the things I wanted her to hear.</i>

212
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,950
<i>There were so many.</i>

213
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,860
We apologize terribly for the wait.

214
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,540
This train will shortly begin
its departure towards Utsunomiya.

215
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,340
This is Oyama. Oyama.

216
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,300
For those passengers changing over to the
Tohoku Bullet Train, please transfer here.

217
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,890
Those passengers transferring to the down-train,
the Tohoku Bullet Train towards Morioka, please transfer to Line 1.

218
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,500
Those passengers transferring to the up-train
towards Tokyo, please transfer to Line 5.

219
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,570
Those passengers transferring to the Mito Line-

220
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:40,605
All passengers, your attention please.

221
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,340
Due to snowy weather conditions, the
Ryomo Line is currently experiencing a serious delay.

222
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,110
We apologize for the terrible inconvenience.

223
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,490
We ask that you please be patient and wait
a little longer until the train arrives.

224
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,750
The next up-train headed for-

225
00:15:57,715 --> 00:15:57,715
<i>Either way...</i>

226
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,340
<i>...I had no choice but to keep going towards
the station where Akari was waiting.</i>

227
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,600
This is the up-train, Line 8, towards Takasaki,
passing Ashikaga and Maebashi on the way.

228
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,800
Please stand behind the white line-

229
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,730
All passengers, your attention please.

230
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,740
Due to the disrupted schedule from the heavy snowfall
this train will be making a temporary stop.

231
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,200
We apologize terribly for this inconvenience in your busy day...

232
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,780
...but presently, we are unable to resume normal service.

233
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,790
I repeat...

234
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,960
"Dear Takaki-kun... "

235
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:05,530
"How are you?"

236
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,740
"I'm actually writing this letter on the train because
practice has been starting really early lately. "

237
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,180
<i>Every time I tried to picture Akari from her letters...</i>

238
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:16,280
<i>...she was always alone for some reason.</i>

239
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:26,310
<i>In the end, the train remained stopped
in the barren wilderness for two hours.</i>

240
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,800
<i>Each minute felt like an eternity.</i>

241
00:18:29,835 --> 00:18:32,780
<i>With clear malice towards me...</i>

242
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,300
<i>...time continued to drift slowly forwards around me.</i>

243
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,500
<i>I clenched my teeth tightly together...</i>

244
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,320
<i>...and could do nothing but endure the pain
and hold back my tears.</i>

245
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,310
<i>Akari...</i>

246
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,500
<i>Please tell me...</i>

247
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,670
<i>...you've already...</i>

248
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,800
<i>...returned home.</i>

249
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:16,070
Line 3 towards Takasaki, passing Ashikaga
and Maebashi on the way has just arrived.

250
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,590
Due to the snowy weather conditions, this train
will be making a temporary stop.

251
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,880
Akari...

252
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,020
It tastes good.

253
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,450
Really?

254
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,270
It's just hot roasted tea.

255
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,520
Roasted tea?

256
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,145
This is my first time having it...

257
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,660
You're kidding. I'm sure you've had it before.

258
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,630
You think?

259
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,730
You must have.

260
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:48,160
And... since I made this, I can't really guarantee
how good it'll taste, but...

261
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,290
If you'd like, please have some.

262
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,840
Thanks!

263
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,880
I was really hungry.

264
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,640
How is it?

265
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,090
It's the most delicious rice ball I've ever had.

266
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,660
You're exaggerating!

267
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,430
It really is!

268
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,550
It's probably just because you're hungry.

269
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,480
You think so?

270
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,550
It must be.

271
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,440
I think I'll have a bite, too.

272
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,640
So... you're moving soon, right?

273
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,320
Yeah. Next week.

274
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,850
Kagoshima, huh?

275
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,890
It's pretty far away.

276
00:21:26,925 --> 00:21:27,550
Yeah...

277
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,010
Though this trip to Tochigi was pretty far, too.

278
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,780
You can't even go home today now, after all.

279
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,310
We'll be closing soon.
There aren't any more trains coming or going.

280
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,380
Yes, sir.

281
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,640
Be careful on your way home in this snow.

282
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,440
Yes, sir.

283
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,340
Can you see the tree way out there?

284
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,040
Is that the tree from your letters?

285
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,160
Yeah. It's a cherry tree.

286
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,360
So...

287
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,060
...don't you think it looks a little like snow?

288
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,910
It sure does.

289
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,860
<i>In that moment...</i>

290
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:52,140
<i>...I felt like I knew where eternity,
our hearts and ours souls all lay.</i>

291
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,980
<i>I felt as though we had shared
all the experiences of my 13 years.</i>

292
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,790
<i>And then... in the next moment...</i>

293
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,960
<i>...I was suddenly filled
with an insufferable sadness.</i>

294
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,230
<i>Akari's warmth... and her soul...</i>

295
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,590
<i>How could I take them in,
and where could I bring them?</i>

296
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,260
<i>I felt that sad because I didn't have those answers.</i>

297
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,600
<i>I clearly knew that from that point on,
we wouldn't be together forever.</i>

298
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,420
<i>The overwhelming weight of our lives to come...</i>

299
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,310
<i>...and the uncertainty of time hung over us.</i>

300
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,630
<i>But... the creeping anxiety that had taken hold of me...</i>

301
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,540
<i>...would soon gradually melt away.</i>

302
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,460
<i>And all that remained would be
the feeling of Akari's soft lips.</i>

303
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,680
<i>We spent that night in a shack
by the side of a field.</i>

304
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,280
<i>Wrapping ourselves in an old blanket,
we talked on and on...</i>

305
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,990
<i>...until finally, we had fallen asleep, side by side.</i>

306
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,300
<i>The next morning, as I boarded the train
that had started its run again...</i>

307
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,580
<i>...I parted with Akari..</i>

308
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,160
Umm... Takaki-kun...

309
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:30,950
Yeah?

310
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,980
Takaki-kun...

311
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,780
...I'm sure you'll be okay from now on.

312
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,520
I just know it!

313
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,980
Thank you.

314
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,820
Akari, you be well, too!

315
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,550
I'll write you!

316
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,330
I'll call, too!

317
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,660
<i>I never told Akari that I'd lost the letter
I wanted to give her.</i>

318
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:12,990
<i>Because I felt that my world
had completely changed after that kiss.</i>

319
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,370
<i>All I wanted was the strength to protect her.</i>

320
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:33,350
<i>With that thought in my mind, I continued to gaze out
over the landscape beyond the window... forever.</i>

321
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,070
Kanae, are you going to go after school, too?

322
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:05,600
Yeah, are you okay with that, Onee-chan?

323
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,310
Fine by me. But be sure to get to your studies, too.

324
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,450
Yeah.

325
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,510
Okay!

326
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,200
Morning.

327
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,240
Good morning, Tohno-kun.

328
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,890
You're really early this morning, huh?

329
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,300
You too, Sumida. You went to the beach again, right?

330
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:02,950
Yeah.

331
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,200
You're practicing hard.

332
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,990
I wouldn't say that...

333
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,670
See you later, Tohno-kun.

334
00:28:10,705 --> 00:28:11,380
Later.

335
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,640
Got it? It's time to begin making your choices.

336
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,780
Be sure to turn it in by Monday, okay?

337
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,960
And remember to talk it over with your parents before.

338
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,300
Looks like Sasaki-san's gonna be going to a college in Tokyo.

339
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,020
No surprise there. I was thinking of maybe
going to a 2-year college in Kumamoto.

340
00:28:30,055 --> 00:28:31,360
What about you, Kanae?

341
00:28:31,395 --> 00:28:33,490
Huh? Umm...

342
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,070
Will you get a job?

343
00:28:35,105 --> 00:28:36,190
Umm...

344
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,590
You really haven't thought about it at all, huh?

345
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,665
The only thing on your mind is Tohno-kun, right?

346
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,080
He definitely left his girlfriend in Tokyo, I'm telling you.

347
00:28:43,115 --> 00:28:44,370
No way!

348
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,630
Still not going well for you?

349
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,930
Yeah... what's gotten into me?

350
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:20,780
It's better if you don't think about it too much.
You'll be able to surf again in no time, I promise.

351
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,030
It must be nice taking things so easy, Onee-chan.

352
00:29:23,065 --> 00:29:24,830
What are you in such a rush for?

353
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:30,590
At this rate, I won't be able to say it before graduation...

354
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,815
Thanks, Onee-chan.

355
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:51,925
I can take you home, too...

356
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,190
Don't worry about it. I'll take my bike home.

357
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,570
Sumida, you're on your way home?

358
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,410
Yeah.

359
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:25,840
You too, Tohno-kun?

360
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:26,640
Yeah.

361
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,470
Wanna go home together?

362
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:32,190
<i>If I had a tail like a dog's...</i>

363
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:37,170
<i>...I'm sure it'd be wagging back and forth right now,
since I'd be unable to hide my happiness.</i>

364
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:42,470
I was sort of relieved and thought to myself,
"Thank goodness I'm not really a dog... "

365
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,350
<i>...and I was surprised at how foolish I was
for thinking what I did earlier.</i>

366
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:50,530
<i>But even still, the trip home with Tohno-kun was bliss.</i>

367
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:59,440
Right from the start, Tohno-kun seemed
a little different from the other boys.

368
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,805
I'm Tohno Takaki.

369
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,900
I'm sorta used to transferring schools
because of my parents' jobs...

370
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,630
...but I'm not too used to this island yet.

371
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,225
It's nice to meet you all.

372
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:12,850
<i>I fell in love at first sight on that day in the second year of middle
school, and wanted to go to the same high school as him...</i>

373
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,390
<i>...so I studied really hard, was somehow accepted...</i>

374
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:21,860
<i>...and every single time I saw him,
fell more and more in love with him.</i>

375
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,995
<i>But it's so scary, and everyday is painful.</i>

376
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,340
<i>Yet every time I see him, I'm filled with such happiness...</i>

377
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,240
<i>...that I'm at a loss for what to do.</i>

378
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,240
Tohno-kun, there you go buying the same one again.

379
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,800
It's really good.

380
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:39,620
Sumida, you always think your decisions
through seriously, don't you?

381
00:31:39,655 --> 00:31:40,500
Yeah.

382
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,050
I'll be outside.

383
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,430
Yeah.

384
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,190
Just this, please.

385
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,920
That'll be 90 yen.

386
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,895
Here you go.

387
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,270
Thanks as always.

388
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,010
Welcome back.

389
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,235
What'd you buy?

390
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,635
Well, it was hard to pick, but I went with this.

391
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:09,210
<i>Sometimes, Tohno-kun would be writing a text message...</i>

392
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,500
<i>...and every time he did, I would always wish...</i>

393
00:32:11,535 --> 00:32:13,760
<i>...that the text message he was writing...</i>

394
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:18,240
<i>...would be addressed to me.</i>

395
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,340
Kabu, I'm home!

396
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,710
Kabu, Kabu!

397
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,400
I'm back.

398
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,115
This is a message from your town hall.

399
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:58,270
The next normal open gasoline stand will be at the
Sakai Agricultural Cooperative Gas Station.

400
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,080
Sumida Kanae-san from Class 3-1...

401
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,825
...Itou-sensei is calling for you.

402
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,680
Please report to the Guidance Counselor's office.

403
00:33:04,715 --> 00:33:05,750
That's your girlfriend, Tohno.

404
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,460
She's not my girlfriend.

405
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,730
You're the only one in the grade who hasn't filled one out.

406
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,090
I'm sorry.

407
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,130
Look, this isn't something someone in my position
should be saying...

408
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,600
...but this isn't really something
you have to wrack your brain over.

409
00:33:20,635 --> 00:33:22,770
Has Sumida-sensei said anything?

410
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,930
No...

411
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:30,560
If you really can't decide, then how about
a 2-year college within the prefecture?

412
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,460
But...

413
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,940
<i>Onee-chan has nothing to do with it...</i>

414
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,710
<i>After all...</i>

415
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:59,370
<i>...surfing, even after I pestered my sister
so much to teach me...</i>

416
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:02,680
...and the most important guy who takes up all of my thoughts...

417
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,930
<i>...are two things I'm still no good at.</i>

418
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,830
Thanks as always.

419
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,770
Not at all. See you next time.

420
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,470
<i>Whenever I go to where Tohno-kun is...</i>

421
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,300
<i>...deep down, my heart... it clenches up... just a little.</i>

422
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,040
Tohno-kun.

423
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,080
Sumida, what's up? I'm surprised you found me way out here.

424
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:19,290
I saw your bike, so I decided to come on by.

425
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,055
That okay?

426
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,550
Ah, I see. I'm glad to see you.

427
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,470
We didn't run into each other at the bike shed today.

428
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,870
I'm glad, too.

429
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,430
<i>He's really kind.</i>

430
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,120
<i>So kind that sometimes it feels like I'm going to cry.</i>

431
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,480
Hey, are you going to test to get into college?

432
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,400
Yeah. I'm going to take a few for some universities in Tokyo.

433
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,155
Tokyo... I see.

434
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,610
I thought that might be the case.

435
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,890
Why do you say that?

436
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,990
You seem like you want to go far away from here, for some reason...

437
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,780
What about you, Sumida?

438
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:56,580
I don't even really know what's going to happen tomorrow.

439
00:35:56,615 --> 00:35:58,550
Everyone's the same.

440
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,380
No way! You too, Tohno-kun?

441
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,460
Of course.

442
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,405
You don't look like you have anything to worry about.

443
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,470
Oh, stop that. I'm filled with nothing but worries.

444
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:12,100
I'm doing all that I can just to keep up.
I have no breathing room.

445
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,790
Really?

446
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,190
I see...

447
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,770
A plane?

448
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,770
Yeah.

449
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,330
Wow...

450
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,500
They say it travels at five kilometers per hour.

451
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,460
It's going to the Minamitane launch facility.

452
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,050
Looks like there'll be a launch this year.
First time in a while.

453
00:37:29,085 --> 00:37:32,390
Yeah. It's supposed to go to the far reaches
of the solar system.

454
00:37:32,425 --> 00:37:34,050
No matter how many years it takes...

455
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,240
Hey... you should really talk to Kanae
about her plans for the future.

456
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,065
You know how absent-minded she can be.

457
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,460
She'll be fine. It's not like she's a child anymore.

458
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,470
I remember when I used to be just like that, a long time ago...

459
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:14,510
Hear that, Kabu? Tohno-kun apparently doesn't
know what tomorrow will bring, either.

460
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,970
We're both the same. Tohno-kun and me.

461
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,250
<i>It must really be...</i>

462
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:24,410
<i>...a lonelier journey than anyone could imagine.</i>

463
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,850
<i>To just press forward through
the true pitch darkness...</i>

464
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,980
<i>Barely encountering even a single hydrogen atom...</i>

465
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,810
<i>Wholeheartedly believing
you'll come closer to discovering...</i>

466
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,040
<i>...the secrets of the universe
within the unfathomable abyss of space.</i>

467
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:47,570
<i>I wonder how far we should go...</i>

468
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,670
<i>How far CAN we go?</i>

469
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:14,500
<i>I wonder when I got in the habit of
writing messages to nobody?</i>

470
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,270
Kanae, have you decided what you'll be doing in the future?

471
00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:56,945
Nope. Like I thought, I'm still not sure...

472
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:01,610
But it's all right! I decided that
I'll just take things on one at a time.

473
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,680
Off I go!

474
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,210
<i>Since that day, a number of typhoons
have passed through...</i>

475
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,130
<i>...and the island's
become a little cooler each time.</i>

476
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:33,570
<i>The wind blowing through the sugarcane
has taken on a slight chill...</i>

477
00:40:33,605 --> 00:40:35,825
<i>...and the sky seems a little higher.</i>

478
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,375
<i>The edges of the clouds have become gentler...</i>

479
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:43,250
<i>...and my classmates have begun wearing light jackets
when riding their bikes with the change in the weather.</i>

480
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:01,775
<i>By the time I managed to ride the waves again,
six long months had passed.</i>

481
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:07,230
<i>Even though it was the middle of October, it felt
like a little bit of summer had been left behind.</i>

482
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:22,490
The weather forecast for tonight shows a clear evening
with winds up to eight meters per second.

483
00:41:22,525 --> 00:41:25,190
So I heard that Yamada confessed to Sasaki-san.

484
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,770
No surprise there.

485
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,575
Huh? Kanae, you seem awfully happy today.

486
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,650
Something good happen between you and Tohno-kun?

487
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,920
No way!

488
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:39,580
<i>Today, I'm finally going to confess to Tohno-kun, too.</i>

489
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:47,140
<i>If I don't tell him today, on the day
I finally rode the waves again...</i>

490
00:41:47,175 --> 00:41:50,020
...I'm sure I won't ever be able to.

491
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,560
Sumida.

492
00:42:01,595 --> 00:42:02,470
To-

493
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,000
Tohno-kun.

494
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,230
On your way home?

495
00:42:06,265 --> 00:42:06,950
Yeah.

496
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,310
I see.

497
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,410
Then, let's go home together.

498
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,750
Huh, Sumida? Decided already today?

499
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,480
Yeah.

500
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:48,620
What's the matter?

501
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,440
...to me...

502
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:03,300
No... I'm sorry. It's nothing.

503
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,885
Is your bike acting up?

504
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,870
Yeah... that's kind of weird.

505
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:17,200
Is it broken?

506
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:20,340
Yeah... I think the spark plug's dead.

507
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,025
Was this a hand-me-down?

508
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,255
Yeah. It was Onee-chan's.

509
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:25,080
Did it stall when you tried accelerating?

510
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,560
It might have, actually...

511
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,310
Let's leave it here for today.

512
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,990
You can have someone from your house pick it up later.

513
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:33,380
Let's walk back today.

514
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,810
Huh? I'll walk by myself!

515
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,570
You go on ahead.

516
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,800
We're this far out, and your place is nearby, so...

517
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:42,450
And... I kind of want to walk today.

518
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,860
<i>Tohno-kun, please...</i>

519
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,950
What's wrong?

520
00:44:32,985 --> 00:44:33,960
I'm sorry...

521
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,030
It's nothing.

522
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:37,170
I'm so sorry...

523
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,710
Sumida...

524
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,320
<i>I'm begging you... please...</i>

525
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:49,220
<i>...don't be so nice to me!</i>

526
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:27,980
<i>As we humans desperately and recklessly
stretched our arms to the top of the sky...</i>

527
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,920
<i>...and launched something
of that mass and size into the air...</i>

528
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,740
<i>...gazing off into the distance towards something
far beyond our wildest dreams...</i>

529
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:45,710
<i>...I felt like I somewhat came to understand why
Tohno-kun was different from the other boys.</i>

530
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,630
<i>And at the same time...</i>

531
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:53,800
<i>...I clearly realized that Tohno-kun
wasn't really looking at me.</i>

532
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:02,520
<i>Which is why, on that day,
I couldn't say a word to Tohno-kun.</i>

533
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,595
<i>Tohno-kun is really kind, but...</i>

534
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,830
<i>He's so truly kind, but...</i>

535
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:26,900
<i>But Tohno-kun was always looking far beyond me.</i>

536
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:30,450
<i>Far beyond me, towards something in the distance.</i>

537
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:44,260
<i>I'm sure I wouldn't be able to give Tohno-kun
what he truly desires.</i>

538
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:48,140
<i>But still... despite that...</i>

539
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:51,800
<i>Tomorrow, the day after, and even beyond that...</i>

540
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,590
<i>...I know I'll still be helplessly in love with him.</i>

541
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:03,120
<i>While thinking solely of Tohno-kun,
I cried myself to sleep.</i>

542
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,700
<i>I strongly felt...</i>

543
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:33,680
<i>...that if I looked back now...</i>

544
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:35,820
<i>...she would look back as well.</i>

545
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:53,640
The last Chuo line train bound for Tokyo is now arriving.

546
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:11,730
You should stay till New Year's.

547
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,720
I know, but I have a million things to take care of.

548
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:16,220
I guess so.

549
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:18,350
Be sure to cook him good meals, you hear?

550
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:19,160
I will.

551
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,180
If there's ever a problem, don't hesitate to call us, Akari.

552
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:23,560
I'll be fine.

553
00:51:23,715 --> 00:51:23,715
The train for platform 2 is now arriving.

554
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:27,100
We'll see each other at the wedding next month,
so don't worry so much.

555
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,900
You'd better head home. It's cold.

556
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:53,460
<i>Last night, I dreamt of something from the distant past.</i>

557
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:58,190
<i>Back when he and I were both still children.</i>

558
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:01,890
<i>I'm sure it's because of that letter I found yesterday.</i>

559
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,380
Mizuno-san.

560
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:57,495
Ah, yes, sir?

561
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:58,530
Have time for that meeting?

562
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,610
Yes, sir.

563
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:13,410
<i>Through the act of living itself,
sadness piles up here and there.</i>

564
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,395
<i>Whether in the sheets hung to dry in the sun...</i>

565
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:18,625
<i>...the single toothbrush in your bathroom...</i>

566
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,820
<i>...or the history logs of your cell phone.</i>

567
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:46,110
<i>"Even now, I still love you... "</i>

568
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:50,690
<i>That's what the girl I'd been with for three years
said in that e-mail.</i>

569
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:55,870
<i>"But I'm sure that even if we had written
1,000 text messages back and forth... "</i>

570
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:00,210
<i>"... our hearts probably wouldn't have moved
even 1 centimeter closer. "</i>

571
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:14,760
<i>Over these past few years, I've only wanted to move
forward and touch that which I couldn't reach...</i>

572
00:54:14,795 --> 00:54:17,060
<i>...though I've never been able to tangibly define what it was.</i>

573
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:24,575
<i>Not knowing where those obsessive thoughts
came from, I simply continued to work.</i>

574
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:29,290
<i>Then one day I realized that my heart was withering,
and in it there was nothing but pain.</i>

575
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,835
<i>And then, one morning...</i>

576
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:38,870
<i>...when I realized that I had completely lost my
earnest and acute feelings from long ago...</i>

577
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:41,590
<i>...I knew I was at my limit...</i>

578
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,420
<i>...and quit my job.</i>

579
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,660
<i>Yesterday, I had a dream.</i>

580
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,000
<i>A dream of long ago.</i>

581
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:18,335
<i>Within the dream, the two of us were still thirteen...</i>

582
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:22,715
<i>...standing upon the vast field blanketed
in snow as far as the eye could see.</i>

583
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:26,960
<i>In the distance, the lights shimmering in
houses were set sparsely, far and wide.</i>

584
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:32,130
<i>All that was left upon the newly fallen snow
were our footprints.</i>

585
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,560
<i>Just like that...</i>

586
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,420
<i>...we wished, without hesitation, that one day...</i>

587
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:39,185
<i>...the two of us would be able...</i>

588
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:42,540
<i>...to see the cherry blossoms together again.</i>

589
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:50,180
I'm always searching for you,
always searching for your figure.

590
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:53,830
On the opposite platform,
or through window in the back alley.

591
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:57,530
Even though I know you can't be there.

592
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:04,840
If my wish were to come true, I would be at your side.

593
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,480
There would be nothing I couldn't do.

594
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:14,860
I would risk everything to embrace you.

595
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:30,930
If only to avoid loneliness, anyone will do.

596
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:38,320
On this night when it seem stars will fall
from the sky, I cannot lie to myself.

597
00:56:38,355 --> 00:56:45,720
One more time, don't fade away, seasons.

598
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:52,990
One more time, I want that time
when we fooled around together.

599
00:56:53,480 --> 00:57:00,520
I'm always searching for you,
always searching for your figure.

600
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:04,260
At the intersection, in my dreams.

601
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:07,980
Even though I know you can't be there.

602
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:15,210
If miracles do happen, I want to show you right now

603
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:18,870
the new dawn, who I'll be from now on,

604
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:24,960
and the words "I love you" that I never said.

605
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:38,480
The memories of summer revolve around me

606
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:47,940
and your throbbing heartbeat that suddenly stopped.

607
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:56,600
I'm always searching for you,
always searching for your figure.

608
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:00,370
In the city at dawn, in Sakuragi-cho.

609
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:03,970
Even though I know you can't be there.

610
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:11,350
If my wish were to come true, I would be at your side.

611
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:15,020
There would be nothing I couldn't do.

612
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,610
I would risk everything to embrace you.

613
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:25,900
I'm always searching for you, always
searching for even a fragment of you.

614
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:29,520
At the shop I'm going to, in the corner of a newspaper.

615
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:33,120
Even though I know you can't be there.

616
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:40,410
If miracles do happen, I want to show you right now

617
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:44,050
the new dawn, who I'll be from now on,

618
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:47,750
and the words "I love you" that I never said.

619
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:55,160
I always end up looking somewhere for your smile.

620
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:58,830
At the railroad crossing, waiting for the express to pass.

621
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:02,380
Even though I know you can't be there.

622
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:09,860
If I could live life over again,
I would be at your side every time.

623
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:13,670
Because I would want nothing

624
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:20,500
more precious than you.

625
01:02:37,770 --> 01:02:43,730
The End
