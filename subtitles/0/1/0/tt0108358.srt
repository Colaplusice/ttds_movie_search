1
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,512
1879. The Civil War is over,

2
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,550
and the resulting economic explosion
spurs the great migration west.

3
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:46,563
Farmers, ranchers, prospectors,
killers and thieves...

4
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:48,792
seek their fortunes.

5
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:51,597
Cattle drovers turn cow towns
into armed camps...

6
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:57,164
with murder rates higher than those
of modern-day New York or Los Angeles.

7
00:00:57,242 --> 00:01:00,678
Out of this chaos comes
legendary lawman Wyatt Earp,

8
00:01:00,745 --> 00:01:04,647
retiring his badge and gun to start
a peaceful life with his family.

9
00:01:04,716 --> 00:01:07,241
Earp's friend
John 'Doc' Holliday...

10
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:10,082
a Southern gentleman
turned gunman and gambler...

11
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:15,354
also travels west, hoping the dry
climate will relieve his tuberculosis.

12
00:01:15,427 --> 00:01:17,691
Silver is discovered
in Arizona.

13
00:01:17,762 --> 00:01:20,595
Tombstone becomes
queen of the boomtowns,

14
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:24,726
where the latest Paris fashions are sold
from the backs of wagons.

15
00:01:24,803 --> 00:01:27,431
Attracted to this
atmosphere of greed,

16
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:30,167
over 100 exiled Texas outlaws
band together...

17
00:01:30,241 --> 00:01:34,974
to form the ruthless gang recognized
by the red sashes they wear.

18
00:01:35,046 --> 00:01:39,710
They emerge as the earliest example
of organized crime in America.

19
00:01:39,784 --> 00:01:43,311
They call themselves
'The Cowboys'

20
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:20,594
Y'all killed
two Cowboys.

21
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:53,160
- Detenganse!
- Shoot.

22
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:56,635
- Looks like we win.

23
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:13,310
Mexican police, huh?

24
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:20,524
Tell him to get on his knees.

25
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:23,462
De rodillas, cabron!

26
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:26,193
De rodillas,
dijo, chingada!

27
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:34,507
He won't no kneel, patron.
He is very proud.

28
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:37,476
- Hey, somebody get
this dick on his knees.

29
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:40,105
Ay, Dios! Ay, Dios!

30
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:42,843
Good shot, Billy.

31
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:47,581
- Gracias!

32
00:04:49,223 --> 00:04:52,750
They call me
Curly Bill Brosius.

33
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:57,287
I'm what you might call
the Founder of the Feast.

34
00:04:57,365 --> 00:05:02,302
So next time we come,
you'd better step aside.

35
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:07,032
I ain't kiddin' neither.

36
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:10,043
Un caballo bajando
por la montana...

37
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:13,308
y el que lo cabalgue
ira a la muerte.

38
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:16,646
Moriremos!

39
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:19,345
Patron,
he say, uh,

40
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,412
someone will come
to revenge for him.

41
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,220
Something like a, a... sick horse
who comes to sit with him.

42
00:05:25,293 --> 00:05:27,887
He talk crazy.
No entiendo un carajo.

43
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:30,829
That's not what he said,
ya ignorant wretch.

44
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:34,163
Your Spanish is worse
than your English.

45
00:05:36,237 --> 00:05:38,728
You go to hell!

46
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:42,037
- You first.

47
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,600
- No!

48
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:51,510
No! No!
- What have we got here?

49
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:09,769
- Hell, let's eat, boys.
Tamales are good, huh?

50
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:12,362
I guess they knew
we were comin'.

51
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:21,077
Temor de Dios. Temor de Dios
es lo que ustedes no tienen.

52
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:24,049
- Muerete, hijo de Satanas!

53
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:37,257
Hey, Johnny, what'd
that Mexican mean...

54
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:41,631
'a sick horse is
gonna get us,' huh?

55
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:44,671
He's quoting the Bible,

56
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:47,833
Revelations.

57
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:50,605
Behold, a pale horse.

58
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:54,637
'The man who sat on him
was Death.

59
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:58,776
And hell followed with him.'

60
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:28,143
Move!

61
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:33,442
- Come on! That's it!
You move!

62
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:36,456
- Stupid mule!

63
00:07:36,524 --> 00:07:38,492
Come on!

64
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,823
Come on!
Come on!

65
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:52,966
Hurts, don't it?

66
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,739
Now let go of that stud and
go on about your business.

67
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,017
Mr. Earp.
My name's Dake.

68
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:14,823
Crawley Dake, U.S. Marshal
for this territory.

69
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:17,728
- Forget it. I'm retired.
- Excuse me?

70
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:21,290
I said forget it.
I don't want the job, and that's final.

71
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:24,827
- I don't think you understand.
- No, you don't understand, Marshal.

72
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:28,932
I did my duty, and now I'd
like to get on with my life.

73
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,638
- I'm going to Tombstone.
Easy on the grain, Butch.
- I see.

74
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:34,647
- Here you go.
- To strike it rich.
Well, all right, that's fine.

75
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:37,548
Tell you one thing, though:
Never saw a rich man...

76
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:40,587
who didn't wind up
with a guilty conscience.

77
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:45,091
I already got a guilty conscience.
Might as well have the money too.

78
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,923
Good day now.

79
00:08:49,497 --> 00:08:54,560
That's him, all right.
Boy, I'd know that sour face anywhere.

80
00:08:57,805 --> 00:09:00,740
Virgil! Morgan!
My god!

81
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:08,804
- Hey, boy! How are you, Morgan?
- Hi, Wyatt.

82
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:11,545
- Well, how do we look?
- Great, both of ya.

83
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:14,520
- Wyatt, you remember Allie.
- Good God. Well, he'd better.

84
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,681
Allie girl.

85
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,850
- And Louisa. Oh!
- Wyatt.

86
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:22,020
You're so lovely, darlin'.
I'm at your feet, just at your feet.

87
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:25,088
I guess it's only right.
Ma always said Morgan's the prettiest.

88
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:29,125
- Yeah, but she doted on the Frowner.
- That's right.

89
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:31,569
- Wyatt.
- Mattie!

90
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,699
Mattie, they're already here.
Folks, this is Celia Andon.

91
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,744
- You can call her Mattie.
- Pleased to meet you, Mattie.

92
00:09:37,812 --> 00:09:40,246
It's nice to meet you.

93
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:43,249
Well, Wyatt, I couldn't
find a single store that
had laudanum anywhere.

94
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:46,980
That's all right, honey.
I sure been dreamin' about this.

95
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:50,421
God, since forever!
Wait! Look here.

96
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:53,426
I wanna...
Look. Huh?

97
00:09:56,497 --> 00:09:58,965
- Hey, Wyatt...
- Don't talk, just...

98
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:02,093
Yeah.

99
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,569
Thank you for this, Wyatt.

100
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:08,506
- It's all your doin'.
- We'll make our fortune, boys.

101
00:10:08,576 --> 00:10:10,806
Well, come on.

102
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:13,447
Gracious.
We could be sisters.

103
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,413
Mighty fine.
I wonder where he found her.

104
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:19,008
Same place we found ours, probably.

105
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:25,458
'Matter, honey?
Did you say you needed some laudanum?

106
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:28,585
- Yes, I did. Yes.
- I have some right here.

107
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:31,597
Oh, you're a lifesaver.

108
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:34,600
Just be careful now.
It's full of hop.

109
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:37,637
Oh, don't worry. I just
get headaches sometimes.

110
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,605
Hey, Virg, see anything of Doc
while you were in Prescott?

111
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:43,609
Yeah. He had a streak
when we left, him and Kate.

112
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:46,441
I miss Doc.
I miss that old rip.

113
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:49,914
- I don't.
- He makes me laugh.

114
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,187
Yeah!

115
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:59,748
- That's $500, Holliday.
Are you in or out?

116
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:13,565
Five hundred.
Must be a peach of a hand.

117
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:20,907
Oh, thank you, darlin'.

118
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:24,576
Kate! You're not
wearing a bustle.

119
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,846
How lewd.

120
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,754
Come on, Holliday,
you in or out, goddammit?

121
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:34,419
Why, Ed Bailey, you look like
you're just about ready to burst.

122
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:38,123
Come on! Come on, show!

123
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:42,931
Well, I suppose
I'm deranged, but I...

124
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:45,563
guess I'll just
have to call.

125
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,369
Cover your ears, darlin'.

126
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,136
Isn't that a daisy?

127
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,239
Why, you son-of-a-bitch!

128
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,284
Damn, Bailey, just settle down!

129
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:02,447
Shut up! Take your
money and get out,

130
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:05,150
'cause I'm tired of
listenin' to your mouth.

131
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:08,194
Why, Ed Bailey,

132
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,752
are we cross?

133
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,425
Them guns don't scare me.

134
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:18,801
'Cause without them guns
you ain't nothin' but a skinny lunger.

135
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:22,273
Ed, what an ugly thing to say.

136
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:27,245
- I abhor ugliness. Does this
mean we're not friends anymore?
-

137
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:30,943
You know, Ed, if I thought
you weren't my friend,

138
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:34,111
I just don't think
I could bear it.

139
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,604
There. Now we can
be friends again.

140
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:09,220
- Touch that gun,
I'll burn you down.

141
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,133
I calculate that's
the end of this town.

142
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:25,695
I had a boy at the hotel pack us up.
The horse is outside.

143
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:28,900
So that's why you're
not wearin' a bustle.

144
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:35,010
My sweet, soft
Hungarian devil.

145
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,588
Well!

146
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,985
Good evenin', then.

147
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:55,601
Let's not bother
about the luggage.

148
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,073
Hyah!

149
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:21,815
Hey, Morg,
pretty big, isn't it?

150
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:30,189
Oh-ho, brother, you can smell
the silver in this town.

151
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,255
- Easy.
- Look at these girls over here.

152
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,427
- Hi!
- Hello, girls!

153
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,937
Hot damn, this burg's jumpin'!

154
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,496
Here we go, ladies.

155
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:45,772
- Isn't that sweet?
- You can say that.

156
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,948
- Sheriff.

157
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,963
Newcomers, eh?

158
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:10,366
The name's John Behan,
Cochise County Sheriff.

159
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,700
- Just in town?
- Just this minute.

160
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:17,141
- I'm Wyatt Earp, and these are
my brothers, Virgil and Morgan.
- Wyatt Earp. Dodge City.

161
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,373
Gave all that up, Sheriff.
Goin' into business.

162
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:24,780
- Don't even carry a gun anymore.
- Going into business, huh?

163
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,547
Well then, I'm the man to see.

164
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,088
Besides sheriff,
I'm also tax collector,

165
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,557
Captain of the Fire Brigade and Chairman
of the Nonpartisan Anti-Chinese League.

166
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,026
- Ma'am.
- How do you do?

167
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,098
Yeah, a man of many parts.

168
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,602
- Say, you folks got
a place to stay yet?
- No.

169
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,333
- Like I said, we just got here.
- Well, I also sit on
the town lot commission.

170
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,705
Really?

171
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:54,679
As a matter of fact, we got three
lovely cottages coming up for rent.

172
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,773
I'll throw in a good cleaning,
no charge.

173
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,944
Believe me, Mr. Earp,

174
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,284
you're not gonna find a better deal
within town limits.

175
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,790
I don't know,
sounds pretty good.

176
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:09,727
- Well, I'll have my man show 'em to ya.
- Thank you.

177
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:19,538
Hey, Wyatt,
get on over here.

178
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:22,439
I want you to meet Fred White.
He's the town marshall.

179
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,703
- My pleasure.
- Lotta law around here.

180
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,769
- I already met the county sheriff.
- Who, Behan?

181
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:31,681
He ain't no law. The only real law
around here is the Cowboys.

182
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:35,915
Cowboys? I had a run-in
with a couple of them up in Prescott.

183
00:17:35,989 --> 00:17:39,083
Nobody does nothin' without 'em.
I mean, they're it.

184
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,718
There are three of 'em
right over there.

185
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:46,163
You can always spot a Cowboy.
They always wear those red sashes.

186
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:50,100
- The main fact is the Cowboys
are good for business.
- 'Bout all these saloons?

187
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:53,229
Oh, that's the real mother lode
here in Tombstone.

188
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,740
All up and down
Allen Street here.

189
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,606
Twenty-four hours a day,
you got liquor, hostesses, gamblin';

190
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:01,078
makin' money
hand-over-fist.

191
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:05,447
All except 'the Oriental.'
That's a regular slaughterhouse.

192
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:08,453
Even the high rollers
won't go near it.

193
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:12,514
That's too bad too.
It's a nice place.

194
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,459
Hell of a waste.

195
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,361
- Wyatt?

196
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,661
- There he goes.
- Yeah.

197
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:26,030
OI' Wyatt.

198
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:32,511
All right, fella,
I'll brace ya now for a little lesson.

199
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:36,106
Put your money on the board.
Five dollars on that six of spades.

200
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:38,743
Like that.

201
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:43,188
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Get that cigar outta my face.

202
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,884
Howdy, stranger.
What can I get ya?

203
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,120
I wouldn't mind
one of those cigars.

204
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:50,857
I'm about ready to go home.
I wish y'all would stop yakkin'...

205
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:53,058
- and just play cards.
- Thank you.

206
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,068
Kinda nice in here.
You run it?

207
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,331
Milt Joyce: Owner, operator.

208
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:01,841
- Wyatt Earp.
- Yeah, sure.

209
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:04,638
I said lay off the queen,
you jackass!

210
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:07,578
I swear I'm gonna
slap somebody now.

211
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:12,812
Excuse me for askin', Milt,
but... kinda dead in here, isn't it?

212
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:15,753
- You don't listen too good, do ya?
- See that bird at the faro table?

213
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,985
You back that queen again,
you son-of-a-bitch,

214
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:22,153
I'll blow you right up
that wildcat's ass!
Do you hear me, huh?

215
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:26,131
He comes bargin' in here one day,
slappin' the customers,
wavin' his gun around.

216
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:28,633
He chased out all
the high-class play.

217
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:32,695
The only trade that comes in
here now is the bummers and
the drovers; just the dregs.

218
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:36,367
Why don't you get rid of him,
get yourself a straight dealer?

219
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:38,741
Sure, stranger,
that's easy for you to say.

220
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:41,713
Shit!

221
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,782
Goddammit, Junior, how many times
am I going to tell you...

222
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:50,949
to keep that damn cigar
outta my face? Huh?

223
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:54,983
Christ almighty, it's like I'm
sittin' here playing cards with
my brother's kids or somethin',

224
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,393
you nerve-wracking
sons-of-bitches.

225
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,924
Is somethin' on your mind?

226
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:04,937
Just want to let you know
you're sittin' in my chair.

227
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:07,405
Is that a fact?

228
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:09,908
Yeah, it's a fact.

229
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:13,935
For a man that don't go heeled, you run
your mouth kinda reckless, don't ya?

230
00:20:14,014 --> 00:20:17,950
No need to go heeled to get
the bulge on a tub like you.

231
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:20,885
- Is that a fact?
- Mm-hmm.

232
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:23,718
That's a fact.

233
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:28,284
Well, I'm real scared.

234
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:33,230
Damn right, you're scared.
I can see that in your eyes.

235
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,791
- All right now!
- Go ahead.

236
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:39,965
Go ahead, skin it! Skin that
smoke wagon and see what happens.

237
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:45,307
Listen, mister,
l-I'm gettin' awful tired of your...

238
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:48,643
I'm gettin' tired of your gas.
Now jerk that pistol and go to work.

239
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:55,420
- I said throw down, boy.

240
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:05,898
You gonna do somethin',
or just stand there and bleed?

241
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:11,133
No?

242
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:15,840
I didn't think so.

243
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:19,743
Here, Milt, a keepsake.

244
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:25,349
Hang it over the bar.
All right, youngster, out you go.

245
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:30,147
Don't come back!

246
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:32,657
Ever!

247
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:38,595
Well, what do you say, Milt?

248
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:42,157
Twenty-five percent
of the house take sound about right?

249
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:44,669
Hyah!

250
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:51,543
Well, we're off and runnin'.

251
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:54,842
Just acquired us a quarter interest
in a game at 'the Oriental.'

252
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:57,109
- Acquired?
- So to speak.

253
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,581
Now all we gotta do is keep our
eyes on that brass ring, fellas.

254
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:06,353
You're the one, Wyatt.

255
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:09,759
Why, Johnny Tyler!

256
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,821
- You madcap!
- Doc?

257
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:16,266
Where you goin'
with that shotgun?

258
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:19,669
I didn't know you
was back in town.

259
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,703
Well, well.

260
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:26,940
How the hell are you?

261
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:30,972
Wyatt, I am rolling.
Morgan.

262
00:22:31,051 --> 00:22:33,815
- Doc.
- Virgil.

263
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:36,651
'Lo, Doc.

264
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:39,248
Wyatt Earp?

265
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:46,129
Going into business
for ourselves, Doc.

266
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:49,532
- Wyatt just got us a faro game.
- Oh.

267
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:52,196
Since when is faro
a business?

268
00:22:52,272 --> 00:22:55,673
- Didn't you always say that
gambling's an honest trade?
- No.

269
00:22:55,742 --> 00:23:00,076
I said poker's an honest trade.
Only suckers buck the tiger's
odds all on the house.

270
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:04,344
Depends on how you look at it.
I mean, it's not like anybody's
puttin' a gun to their head.

271
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:08,820
That's what I love about Wyatt.
He can talk himself into anything.

272
00:23:10,924 --> 00:23:14,985
Oh. Johnny, I apologize.
I forgot you were there.

273
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,325
You may go now.

274
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:20,889
Just leave that shotgun.

275
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:27,335
Leave it.

276
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:31,169
Thank you.

277
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:35,241
Sheriff Behan!

278
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:38,284
- Gentlemen!
- Sheriff,

279
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:42,014
- have you met Doc Holliday?
- Piss on you, Wyatt.

280
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:46,419
Mr. Holliday.

281
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:49,860
Forgive me
if I don't shake hands.

282
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:55,429
- So, how's our little town suit you?
- Fine. Fine.

283
00:23:55,502 --> 00:23:59,199
You know, I was thinking, what this town
could really use is a racetrack.

284
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:03,504
Really? That's not a bad idea.
Send a signal we're growin' up.

285
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:07,637
Way ahead of yourselves,
aren't you, boys? This
is just another mining camp.

286
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:11,275
Have you seen how everyone dresses?
Awful tony for a mining camp.

287
00:24:11,351 --> 00:24:13,785
No sir, the die is cast.
We are growin'.

288
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:17,380
- Be as big as San Francisco in
a few years, and just as sophisticated.

289
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:21,416
- You son-of-a-bitch!

290
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:23,985
Easy, gents!
It's a private affair!

291
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:29,023
- Don't raise that iron.
I'm gonna have to...
- I'll kill you, you cheap son-of-a...

292
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,667
Very cosmopolitan.

293
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:37,369
I know him.
That's Creek Johnson.

294
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:43,113
Wyatt? Doc?

295
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:48,543
- Jack.
- What do you say, old friend?

296
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:52,758
What the hell's that
all about, Creek?

297
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:56,125
- He crawfished a bet
and called me a liar.
- Sheriff,

298
00:24:56,196 --> 00:25:00,565
may I present a pair
of fellow sophisticates:
Turkey Creek Jack Johnson,

299
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:02,658
Texas Jack Vermillion.

300
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:06,296
Watch your ear, Creek.

301
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:09,933
- Afraid I'll have to have those guns.
- It was a fair fight.

302
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,445
- We was legal.
- I'm sorry, boys. I gotta
take 'em before Judge Spicer.

303
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:16,038
Hand 'em over.

304
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:18,413
Law and order every time,
that's us.

305
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:25,153
- Ha!

306
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:31,863
Whoa!

307
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,664
I'm frightfully thirsty.

308
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:38,670
Well, we made it.

309
00:25:43,443 --> 00:25:46,276
Sheriff,
what kinda town is this?

310
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:52,414
Nice scenery.

311
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:59,823
Well,

312
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:02,953
an enchanted moment.

313
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:12,304
Interesting little scene. I wonder
who that tall drink of water is.

314
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:16,103
My dear, you have set your gaze
upon the quintessential frontier type.

315
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:20,236
Note the lean silhouette, eyes closed
by the sun; they're sharp as a hawk.

316
00:26:20,313 --> 00:26:24,682
He's got the look of
both predator... and prey.

317
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:27,083
I want one.

318
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:29,747
Happy hunting.

319
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:00,015
- Hey, sister boy, gimme some!

320
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:03,249
- Gimme, gimme, gimme!
- Leave him alone, Barnes!

321
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:06,224
Billy, sit with me.

322
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:16,934
This is so much fun. We haven't
been to the show in six years.

323
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:19,631
I hope they're good.

324
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:24,603
- Wyatt?
- Oh, sorry.

325
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:31,381
Darlin', you know the Earps.

326
00:27:31,451 --> 00:27:33,646
Kate, how you been?

327
00:27:35,188 --> 00:27:38,055
Mattie, hmm, ravishin'.

328
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:40,649
Doc.

329
00:27:42,362 --> 00:27:45,991
Wyatt, I'd like ya
to meet Mayor Clum and his wife.

330
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:49,000
- Mr. Earp.
Your reputation precedes you.
- Mayor.

331
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:53,164
- I was wondering if you might be...
- Not a prayer. Nice meetin' you.

332
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:10,785
Professor Gillman? Oh, I seen him
in Bisbee. He catches stuff.

333
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:13,348
Hey, Professor,
catch this.

334
00:28:15,428 --> 00:28:18,192
They're shooting at us!
They're actually shooting at us.

335
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:22,200
- I guess we'll have
to wait for our notices.

336
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:27,203
Prettiest man I ever saw.

337
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:29,002
Whoo!

338
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:31,669
- Whoo-hoo!
- Ladies and gentlemen,

339
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:34,406
the St. Crispin's Day
speech from Henry V.

340
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,415
- To set the scene...

341
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:39,644
Goddamn, Barnes!
- Shot his damn ear off.

342
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:42,483
- 'Lf we are marked to die,

343
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,989
'we are now to do
our country loss.

344
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:50,155
But if to live, the fewer men,
the greater share of honor... '

345
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:53,426
He's got some nerve, I'll say that.
What d'ya think there, Billy Nilly?

346
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:57,333
- I think he's wonderful.

347
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,371
'... gentle his condition.

348
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:02,897
'Gentlemen in England now abed
shall think themselves accurs'd
they were not here,

349
00:29:02,976 --> 00:29:06,878
- 'And hold their manhoods cheap...

350
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:11,280
whilst any speaks who fought with us
upon Saint Crispin's day.'

351
00:29:11,351 --> 00:29:14,184
- That's great!
That's our kinda stuff!

352
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:24,595
Play it again!

353
00:29:34,007 --> 00:29:36,874
Now what in the hell is this?

354
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:41,937
Th-That's Faust.
H-He's gonna make a deal with the devil.

355
00:29:42,015 --> 00:29:45,314
Is your soul
for sale, dear?

356
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,732
Know what I'd do?

357
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:05,430
I'd take the deal, then crawfish
and drill that old devil in the ass.

358
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:11,577
How 'bout you, Juanito?
What would you do?

359
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:16,741
I already did it.

360
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:37,960
Very instructive.

361
00:30:39,372 --> 00:30:42,603
- Hmm.

362
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,276
But who is the devil?

363
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:01,416
I'll be damned.

364
00:31:02,729 --> 00:31:05,596
You may indeed,
if you get lucky.

365
00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:12,871
Would you look
at all those stars?

366
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:17,137
I mean, you look up and you think,
'God made all of that?

367
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,771
He still remembered to make
a little speck like me.'

368
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:23,782
Kinda flattering,
really.

369
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:26,580
Wyatt, do you
believe in God?

370
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:29,678
- No, come on, really. Do ya?
- Yeah. Maybe.

371
00:31:29,756 --> 00:31:33,021
- Hell, I don't know.
- Well, what d'you think
happens when you die?

372
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:35,856
Somethin'. Nothin'.
Hell, I don't know.

373
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:38,829
Well, I read this book,
a book on spiritualism.

374
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:41,366
Oh, God, here
he goes again.

375
00:31:41,434 --> 00:31:44,369
Said that a lot of people
when they die, they see this light.

376
00:31:44,437 --> 00:31:46,871
- Like in a tunnel.
- Yeah?

377
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:49,874
- They say it's the light
leadin' you to Heaven.
- Really?

378
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:53,503
- Well, what about Hell?
They got a sign there, or what?
- Hey, Wyatt, goddammit.

379
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:57,015
- I'm serious.
- Hey, Morg. Comin'
to the Oriental, Virg?

380
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,381
- Well...
- Not tonight.

381
00:31:59,452 --> 00:32:02,319
Tonight, me and my old man
are gonna have some fun.

382
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:04,652
Come on, get movin',
old man.

383
00:32:04,724 --> 00:32:07,659
Maiden name was Sullivan.

384
00:32:09,729 --> 00:32:15,133
- Well, you better go with them,
honey. I gotta go to work.
- Please stay with me.

385
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:18,693
Well, honey, l-I
gotta get to work.

386
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:21,968
All right.
All right.

387
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:25,442
Well, wait a minute. I guess
I don't have to go right now. I...

388
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:28,503
- I could stay awhile.
- No, no. I don't wanna keep you.

389
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:31,106
No, really,
I can stay awhile.

390
00:32:31,184 --> 00:32:35,814
That the bottle
Lou gave you?

391
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:38,322
Yes, it is.

392
00:32:38,391 --> 00:32:40,655
Maybe you should
see a doctor.

393
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:45,529
Wyatt, it's
just headaches.

394
00:32:45,598 --> 00:32:48,965
I know what I'm doing. No,
I don't need to see a doctor!

395
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:51,595
- All right, honey. Okay.
- Just go.

396
00:32:51,671 --> 00:32:54,538
Everything's fine, Wyatt.

397
00:32:54,607 --> 00:32:57,701
- Work well.
- All right, good night.

398
00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:02,745
You look beautiful tonight.

399
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:05,443
Thank you.

400
00:33:08,054 --> 00:33:10,989
- Night, Mattie.
- Good night, Morgan.

401
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:15,956
Come on.

402
00:33:19,699 --> 00:33:22,896
- I want to match
seven, seven stinkin' spades.

403
00:33:22,969 --> 00:33:25,403
- Let's go.
- I'm your man.

404
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:28,440
You win again. Well played, sir.
You are on fire.

405
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:31,169
- I told you, I'm burnin' up tonight.
- Loser on the ace.

406
00:33:31,244 --> 00:33:34,179
I'll take the red seven,
and I got some deeds here.

407
00:33:34,247 --> 00:33:37,842
- I'll take seven stinkin' diamonds.
- Awww-ful lot of money.

408
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:41,182
- You can't stand the heat, pal,
get out of the kitchen.
- You're the doctor.

409
00:33:41,254 --> 00:33:43,586
Sad news, friend,
you lose.

410
00:33:43,656 --> 00:33:47,387
- So, now we're in
the mining business.
- You're the one, Wyatt.

411
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,054
We're turnin' into
regular tycoons.

412
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:53,428
Think I'll call this one
the Mattie Blalock. Mattie'd
get a kick outta that one.

413
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:56,127
- That's her maiden name.
- And what a maiden.

414
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:59,137
- Pure as the driven snow, I'm sure.
- Hey, Doc, come on now.

415
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:02,663
It's just his style, Morg.
He doesn't mean anything.

416
00:34:02,742 --> 00:34:05,370
Tell me something,
my friend. I'm curious.

417
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:09,847
Do you actually consider yourself
a married man, forsaking all others?

418
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:12,077
Yeah, pretty much.

419
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:16,019
I mean, I was no angel
when we met, but neither was she.

420
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:20,548
People can change, Doc.
Sooner or later, you gotta grow up.

421
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:22,992
I see.

422
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:26,828
And what would you do,
if she walked in here?

423
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:31,359
- 'She'?
- You know damn well who I mean.

424
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:34,201
That dusky-hued
lady satan, that's who.

425
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:36,537
- Oh, I'd probably ignore her.
- Ignore her?

426
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:39,544
I'd ignore her.
People can change, Doc.

427
00:34:39,612 --> 00:34:41,978
I'll remember
you said that.

428
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:44,380
- What?

429
00:34:47,353 --> 00:34:51,255
- Bravo! Bravo!
- Ma'am? Miss Marcus?

430
00:34:51,324 --> 00:34:54,054
Aw, hell.

431
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,920
Bravo!

432
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,037
Whoo!

433
00:35:17,917 --> 00:35:21,114
Miss Marcus, allow me
the pleasure of a drink.

434
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:24,156
- Thank you, sir.
- Milt, champagne!

435
00:35:24,223 --> 00:35:26,316
Satisfied?

436
00:35:26,392 --> 00:35:29,987
I stand corrected, Wyatt.
You're an oak.

437
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,375
- Thanks, Kate.

438
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:55,217
Mr. Fabian.

439
00:35:55,288 --> 00:35:57,119
- Well done.
- Well done.

440
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,158
Good show, partner,
good show.

441
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:01,785
Mr. Fabian, would you
come sit at my table?

442
00:36:03,396 --> 00:36:06,332
Mr. Earp, would you mind signing
an autograph for me, sir?

443
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:07,663
Mr. Earp, would you mind signing
an autograph for me, sir?

444
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:12,067
My wife's not gonna
believe this.

445
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:19,669
Wyatt Earp, huh?
Heard of you.

446
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:24,378
Listen now,
Mr. Kansas Law Dog.

447
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:27,510
Law don't go around here.
Savvy?

448
00:36:27,587 --> 00:36:30,522
- I'm retired.
- Good.

449
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:33,388
That's real good.

450
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:37,896
Yeah. Yeah, that's real good, law dog,
'cause law just don't go around here.

451
00:36:37,964 --> 00:36:41,730
Yeah, I heard you the first
time. Winner to the king.
Five hundred dollars.

452
00:36:45,972 --> 00:36:50,739
- Shut up, Ike.
- You must be Doc Holliday.

453
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,711
That's the rumor.

454
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:57,613
You retired too?

455
00:36:57,683 --> 00:37:00,846
Not me.
I'm in my prime.

456
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,912
Yeah, you look it.

457
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,484
- Uh, you must be Ringo.

458
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:11,462
Look, darlin',
Johnny Ringo,

459
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:16,524
the deadliest pistoleer
since Wild Bill, they say.

460
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:20,402
What do you think, darlin',
should I hate him?

461
00:37:20,473 --> 00:37:23,704
- You don't even know him.
- No. That's true,

462
00:37:23,776 --> 00:37:27,735
but... I don't know, there's
just somethin' about him.

463
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:31,112
Somethin' 'round the eyes.

464
00:37:31,183 --> 00:37:34,277
I don't know.

465
00:37:34,353 --> 00:37:37,584
Reminds me of...

466
00:37:37,657 --> 00:37:40,057
me.

467
00:37:40,126 --> 00:37:43,527
No. I'm sure of it,
I hate him.

468
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:45,894
He's drunk.

469
00:37:45,965 --> 00:37:48,763
In vino veritas.

470
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:53,203
Age quod agis.

471
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:08,082
In pace requiescat.

472
00:38:08,154 --> 00:38:13,114
Come on, boys, we don't want any
trouble in here, not in any language.

473
00:38:13,192 --> 00:38:15,422
That's Latin, darlin'.

474
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:18,657
Evidently, Mr. Ringo's
an educated man.

475
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:21,256
Now I really hate him.

476
00:38:22,368 --> 00:38:25,826
- Watch it, Johnny.

477
00:38:25,905 --> 00:38:28,965
- I hear he's real fast.

478
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:39,284
- Come on. Go, Johnny.

479
00:38:59,105 --> 00:39:02,199
- Yeah!

480
00:39:42,014 --> 00:39:43,675
- Bravo!

481
00:39:52,992 --> 00:39:55,256
- Drinks are on me!
- Whoo!

482
00:40:02,168 --> 00:40:04,693
Gettin' kinda spooky
around here.

483
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:07,204
- Curly Bill, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

484
00:40:07,273 --> 00:40:11,073
- Who was that other idiot?
- Ike Clanton.

485
00:40:11,143 --> 00:40:14,943
- Table's open!
- The man dealing faro, who is he?

486
00:40:15,014 --> 00:40:20,281
That's Wyatt Earp. Built a name for
himself as a peace officer in Kansas.

487
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:23,617
Hmm, peace officer.

488
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:26,123
Very impressive.

489
00:40:28,294 --> 00:40:31,058
I believe he's married.

490
00:40:33,365 --> 00:40:35,458
More champagne?

491
00:40:52,384 --> 00:40:55,319
Oh, hell.

492
00:41:03,162 --> 00:41:06,359
- Hello.
- Hello.

493
00:41:06,432 --> 00:41:09,094
We've, uh, we've never actually met.
My name is...

494
00:41:09,168 --> 00:41:11,363
Wyatt Earp.
Yes, I know.

495
00:41:11,437 --> 00:41:13,701
- I'm Jos...
- Josephine Marcus.

496
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:16,240
Everybody knows.

497
00:41:17,443 --> 00:41:20,207
I was beginning to think
we'd never meet.

498
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:23,476
This is fortuitous.
That means 'lucky.'

499
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:26,211
Yeah, I...
I know what it means.

500
00:41:26,285 --> 00:41:28,480
- Easy now.

501
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:31,455
- What is it?
- That mare is in season.

502
00:41:31,524 --> 00:41:34,891
Bet she's starting.

503
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,624
- How do they know?
- They know. It's the scent.

504
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:41,563
Ah!

505
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:46,666
- Well, I guess we'd better split
'em up. It's been real n...
- I have a better idea.

506
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:48,969
Let's run it out of them.

507
00:41:51,577 --> 00:41:54,045
Yeah, I'm an oak,
all right.

508
00:42:34,186 --> 00:42:37,121
- Whoa!

509
00:42:37,189 --> 00:42:40,124
Well, end of the road.

510
00:42:40,192 --> 00:42:42,717
- Maybe for you. Hyah!
- Hyah!

511
00:43:03,082 --> 00:43:05,380
That was lovely.

512
00:43:05,451 --> 00:43:08,477
Lovely? You could've been
killed back there, or busted up.

513
00:43:08,554 --> 00:43:10,681
Fun, though,
wasn't it?

514
00:43:10,756 --> 00:43:13,691
- You'd die for fun?
- Wouldn't you?

515
00:43:15,928 --> 00:43:18,692
Oh, he's laughing. I didn't
think you ever laughed.

516
00:43:18,764 --> 00:43:21,130
Yeah, I...
I laugh sometimes.

517
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,002
Yes, but how often?
Are you happy?

518
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:29,072
Am I happy? Well, I don't know.
I'm happy as the next man, I guess.

519
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,132
I don't laugh all day long like
an idiot, if that's what you mean.

520
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:35,441
- Touchy about it, aren't you?
- No, I'm not touchy. I'm just...

521
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:40,143
It's a silly question, is all.
'Am I happy? Are you happy? '
Are you happy?

522
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:43,278
Oh, I'm always happy,
unless I'm bored.

523
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:46,289
That blonde woman,
is that your wife?

524
00:43:47,392 --> 00:43:49,826
What about her?

525
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:53,830
Nothing. What do you
want out of life?

526
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,900
Geez!

527
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,631
- How do you get these questions?
- Just answer.

528
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:03,139
I don't know!
Make some money, I guess.

529
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:06,768
- Maybe... have some children.
- Doesn't suit you.

530
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:10,678
- Well, how would you know?
- It just doesn't, that's all.

531
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:14,514
I oughta know my own mind,
and I'm telling you what
suits me is a family and kids.

532
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:17,554
Suits me right down to the ground.
In fact, that's my idea of heaven.

533
00:44:17,622 --> 00:44:21,422
- All right, what's
your idea of heaven?
- Room service.

534
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:27,725
Oh, he's laughing again.
Well, that's what I want.

535
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:31,701
I wanna move and go places
and never look back.

536
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,203
Just have fun, forever.

537
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:38,402
That's my idea of heaven.
Need someone to share it with, though.

538
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:41,172
You mean Behan.

539
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,215
Well, then...

540
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:50,015
Why are you with him?

541
00:44:50,088 --> 00:44:54,047
Because he's handsome
and he's charming and...

542
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:57,959
He's all right.
For now.

543
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,520
Oh, I know, don't say it,
I'm rotten.

544
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:04,295
I've tried to be good.
It's just so boring.

545
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,836
The way you talk.

546
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:10,203
Never heard a woman
talk like that?

547
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:13,974
Never.

548
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:18,505
I don't have time to be proper.
I wanna live.

549
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:21,279
I'm a woman.
I like men.

550
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:25,721
If that means I'm not ladylike,
then I guess I'm just not a lady.

551
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:29,521
- At least, I'm honest.
- You're different.

552
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:31,687
There's no arguin' that.

553
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:35,391
But you're a lady,
all right.

554
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,833
I'll take my oath on it.

555
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:46,275
- Giddap! Come on!

556
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,657
Is that the opium
Lou gave you?

557
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:12,093
It's a new bottle,
isn't it?

558
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:15,105
You better go easy
on that stuff.

559
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:18,665
Wyatt, leave me alone.

560
00:46:18,743 --> 00:46:22,235
- And where've you been?
- Just out.

561
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:25,248
- Hmm.
- Ridin'.

562
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:32,989
- How're you feelin', Mattie?

563
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:38,526
Uh, uh...
I don't know. Uh...

564
00:46:38,596 --> 00:46:40,791
I'm all right.

565
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:44,933
I'm fine.

566
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,994
- You sure?
- Su... I'm sure.

567
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:53,639
Well, I was
thinkin' today,

568
00:46:53,711 --> 00:46:56,646
we've already made
a pile of money in this place.

569
00:46:56,714 --> 00:46:59,706
If we pulled up stakes
and just moved on, you know,

570
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:02,810
then we could stay on the move,
keep goin', see the world.

571
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:06,618
Just... live on room service
for the rest of our lives.

572
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:09,159
How'd that be?

573
00:47:09,227 --> 00:47:13,323
Room serv...

574
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:17,527
Wyatt, what're you
talkin' about?

575
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:22,599
Nothin'. I just...

576
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,938
Just thinkin' out loud,
and you know I...

577
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:30,313
Nothin'.

578
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:34,684
Forget about it.

579
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:50,700
Ow!

580
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:56,239
What's she doin' with that lunger?

581
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:10,311
Hey!

582
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:14,154
Hey!

583
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:18,127
Is that 'Old Dog Trey'?
That sounds like 'Old Dog Trey' to me.

584
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,324
Pardon?

585
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,732
You know, Stephen Foster.

586
00:48:24,802 --> 00:48:28,067
'Oh! Susanna,'

587
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:30,664
'Camptown Races.'

588
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:34,807
Stephen stinkin' Foster!

589
00:48:34,879 --> 00:48:37,313
Uh, yes, well,

590
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:40,441
this happens to be
a nocturne.

591
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:43,385
- A which?
- You know,

592
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:46,787
- Frederic fucking Chopin.

593
00:48:56,901 --> 00:48:59,335
Oh, yeah.

594
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:16,219
Boy, I feel great.

595
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:21,183
I feel... just...

596
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:24,193
capital.

597
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,815
- Yaahhh!

598
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:55,855
- Do you see what's
going on in the street?

599
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:58,793
- Somebody's gotta do something.
- I believe you're the sheriff.

600
00:49:58,863 --> 00:50:03,027
No, no, no, no. This is
not county business. This is
a town matter. Marshal?

601
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,625
Yaahhh!

602
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:08,729
- Why don't you just leave it alone?

603
00:50:08,806 --> 00:50:13,743
No, I, uh...
I gotta do somethin'.

604
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:17,474
Wah-hoo-wahhh!

605
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:20,073
Here's your down card.

606
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:41,798
- Curly Bill!

607
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:47,008
Come on now.

608
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:49,545
Well, howdy, Fred.

609
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:53,674
Hand those over, Curly.
Hand 'em over.

610
00:50:57,555 --> 00:51:00,080
Why, sure, Dad.

611
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,095
I'm only funnin'.

612
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,253
Here you go.

613
00:51:18,843 --> 00:51:21,676
Fred?

614
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,942
Come on now. Fred?

615
00:51:27,852 --> 00:51:31,219
- Got ol' Fred White!
- Hey, everybody!

616
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:35,418
Better get him
off the street.

617
00:51:35,493 --> 00:51:38,428
Fred White's dead! They killed him.
They killed Fred White!

618
00:51:38,496 --> 00:51:42,660
- All right, back off.
- Get a rope! String him up!

619
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:45,566
- Nobody's hangin' anybody.
- He just killed a man!

620
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:48,799
Then he'll stand trial for it.
Now get back! Move!

621
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:53,901
Turn him loose!

622
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,115
He said to turn
loose of him.

623
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:09,956
- Well, I'm not; so, go home.

624
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:14,964
I swear to God, law dog, you don't
step aside, we'll tear you apart.

625
00:52:15,032 --> 00:52:18,593
All right, you die first.
Get it?

626
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:23,971
Your friends might get me
in a rush, but not before
I make your head into a canoe.

627
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:28,501
- He's bluffin'. Let's rush him.
- No... he ain't bluffin'.

628
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:31,639
You're not as stupid
as you look, Ike.

629
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:35,446
- Now tell them to get back.
- Go on now, get back.

630
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:39,216
Go on!
Billy!

631
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:42,987
He'll kill me.

632
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:49,393
- And you, music lover,

633
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:51,696
you're next.

634
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:55,227
It's the drunk piano player.

635
00:52:55,306 --> 00:52:58,298
You're so drunk,
you can't hit nothin'.

636
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:01,811
In fact, you're
probably seein' double.

637
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:06,339
I have two guns,
one for each of ya.

638
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:09,511
All right, back it up now!

639
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:17,190
Go home now!

640
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:31,669
I'll see you soon.

641
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:35,200
- I'll see you soon.
- We'll meet again.

642
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:42,880
Well, as you can see,

643
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:45,751
never a dull moment.

644
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:13,313
So it takes Judge Spicer
three weeks to get back to town,

645
00:54:13,384 --> 00:54:16,319
and he says, 'Well,
did you actually see it? '

646
00:54:16,387 --> 00:54:19,879
I said, 'No. By the time I got there,
Marshal White had already been shot.'

647
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:22,892
Then Spicer leans forward
and he says,

648
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,952
- 'Well, can't have a murder
without a witness.'

649
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:28,658
- What?
- Case dismissed. Can you beat it?

650
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:32,498
After all that?
Aw, hell, who cares?

651
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:35,037
None of my business anyway.

652
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,733
Ready to go, Milt?

653
00:54:37,808 --> 00:54:41,369
God, I love this game!
You know, boys, when we're finally set,

654
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:44,414
we gotta each have
a billiard room in our houses.

655
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,915
I been thinkin',

656
00:54:46,984 --> 00:54:50,181
maybe we oughta open up
a place of our own. You know?

657
00:54:50,254 --> 00:54:53,690
- There's the real money. Build it up,

658
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:56,351
Milk it for all it's worth,
then sell it off for a bundle...

659
00:54:56,427 --> 00:55:00,227
and breeze outta this burg
with more money than Cresus
and ready to live like kings.

660
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,789
What d'ya think, Virg?

661
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:06,961
Virg?

662
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,972
Why don't you and me
take a walk around town...

663
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:14,204
and see if we can't spot us out
a couple of nice lots?

664
00:55:14,278 --> 00:55:17,441
It's workin' out just
like you said, Wyatt.

665
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:21,780
- Goddamn, boys, we're lootin'
this burg six ways from Sunday.
- Pretty fun too, isn't it?

666
00:55:21,852 --> 00:55:25,948
- Actually, yeah, I gotta admit.
- Excuse me. Wyatt,
do you have a moment?

667
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:30,050
- Will you just hear me out?
- Now hold on, Mayor.
He already told you now.

668
00:55:30,127 --> 00:55:32,220
You tell him, Morg.

669
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:35,823
What about you?
You were a lawman.

670
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:40,199
- I'm busy.

671
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,397
We're all busy.

672
00:55:42,473 --> 00:55:46,637
Sorry, Mayor, but you're
barkin' up the wrong tree.

673
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,577
You know, you men are makin'
a lot of money in this town.

674
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:52,376
That's good. That's good.
Good for you.

675
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:55,680
In the meantime, a lot of
decent people are suffering.

676
00:55:55,753 --> 00:56:00,383
But, please, don't let me take up
any more of your precious time.

677
00:56:04,495 --> 00:56:06,656
Rack 'em.

678
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:10,188
I tell ya, I'm suffering.
From a hangover.

679
00:56:18,075 --> 00:56:20,339
- Stop that!

680
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:22,709
Stop. No.

681
00:57:18,035 --> 00:57:21,198
Hold on a minute!
Wait a minute!

682
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:24,672
- Calm down and listen to me!

683
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:27,676
Nobody's sayin'
you can't own a gun.

684
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:30,838
Nobody's even sayin'
you can't carry a gun.

685
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:34,315
All we're sayin' is you
can't carry a gun in town.

686
00:57:38,222 --> 00:57:42,090
That's not so bad,
is it?

687
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:49,532
Listen, Mayor, I have
to talk to you about this.

688
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,831
No, we don't have to talk.
You can read, can't you?
It's a town matter.

689
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:57,704
What in the hell are you doin'?
I told you we weren't gettin' involved.

690
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:00,368
You got us involved
when you brought us here.

691
00:58:00,444 --> 00:58:03,538
Now you hold on
a minute, Virg.

692
00:58:03,614 --> 00:58:07,209
Hold on nothin'!
I walk around this town and
look these people in the eyes.

693
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:10,151
It's just like someone's
slappin' me in the face.

694
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,654
These people are afraid
to walk down the street,

695
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:15,658
and I'm tryin' to make money off
that like some goddamn vulture!

696
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:19,162
If we're gonna have a future
in this town, it's gotta have
some law and order.

697
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:21,220
Don't do this to me!

698
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:24,961
- It's got nothin' to do
with you! It's got to do wi...
- Nothin' to do with me?

699
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:28,198
I'm your brother, for Christ's sake!
God, I don't believe this!

700
00:58:28,272 --> 00:58:31,730
Talk to him, will you?
Or hit him!

701
00:58:34,645 --> 00:58:36,840
Ah, God, don't tell me!

702
00:58:36,914 --> 00:58:39,348
Like you said, Wyatt,
we're brothers.

703
00:58:39,416 --> 00:58:43,477
Gotta back your brother's play.
Just did like I figured you would.

704
00:58:43,554 --> 00:58:47,354
All right now, you listen
to me, both of ya!

705
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:51,226
For the first time
in our lives,

706
00:58:51,295 --> 00:58:53,729
we got a chance to stop wandering
and finally be a family.

707
00:58:53,797 --> 00:58:56,766
This is trouble we don't need.
You saw what happened to Fred White.

708
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:59,063
We know what
we're doin', Wyatt.

709
00:58:59,136 --> 00:59:03,232
Okay, fine. Say you're right,
say you don't get yourself killed.

710
00:59:03,307 --> 00:59:06,071
There's somethin' else.

711
00:59:06,143 --> 00:59:11,308
All those years I worked those
cow towns, I was only ever mixed
up in one shootin', just one.

712
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,680
But a man lost his life,
and I took it.

713
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:17,117
You don't know how
that feels, Morg.

714
00:59:17,187 --> 00:59:20,953
Believe me, boy,
you don't ever wanna know.

715
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:24,016
Not ever.

716
00:59:30,534 --> 00:59:33,469
Didn't even make a dent, did I?

717
00:59:33,537 --> 00:59:36,870
All right.

718
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:40,171
You're both makin' a big mistake.

719
00:59:45,983 --> 00:59:52,980
# What remained of our day
in the sunshine #

720
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:59,189
- # That brightened
our pathway a while #
- Do you wanna ante?

721
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:06,032
- Yeah, fine.
- # Come and sit by my side
if you love me #

722
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:13,066
# Do not hasten
to bid me adieu #

723
01:00:13,144 --> 01:00:20,209
# But remember
the Red River Valley #

724
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:25,688
# And the girl who has
loved you so true #

725
01:00:25,756 --> 01:00:30,591
- What do you think of the singer?
- # Will you think of the vow... #

726
01:00:30,661 --> 01:00:33,721
Nice voice.

727
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:37,859
Wyatt, Doc won't quit.
He's been at it for 36 hours straight.

728
01:00:37,935 --> 01:00:40,870
Clanton and the McLaury brothers
came in an hour ago.

729
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:46,535
- I tried to get him to go to bed,
but he won't let go.
- I know, and nobody can make him.

730
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:54,315
Wyatt, just in time.
Pull up a chair.

731
01:00:54,385 --> 01:00:58,253
Doc, you been hittin' it
awful hard, haven't ya?

732
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:03,692
Nonsense. I've not yet
begun to defile myself.

733
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:06,252
I was wonderin' if you
wouldn't wanna go on over
to the Crystal Palace...

734
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,924
I will not be pawed at,
thank you very much.

735
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:10,933
- I'm sorry.
- That's right.

736
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:13,970
Doc can go on day and night,
and then some.

737
01:01:15,773 --> 01:01:20,210
That's my loving man.
Have another one, my loving man.

738
01:01:20,277 --> 01:01:23,212
I'm in.

739
01:01:24,281 --> 01:01:26,215
Straight.

740
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:30,049
Loving man,
you been called.

741
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,355
Oops.

742
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,930
What is that now?

743
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:50,133
That 12 hands in a row, Holliday?
Son-of-a-bitch, nobody's that lucky.

744
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:55,008
Why, Ike,
whatever do you mean?

745
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:57,809
Take it easy, boys.

746
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:02,879
Maybe poker's
just not your game, Ike.

747
01:02:04,288 --> 01:02:08,622
I know, let's have
a spelling contest.

748
01:02:08,692 --> 01:02:12,287
- How 'bout if I just
wring your scrawny neck?
- Enough, Ike.

749
01:02:13,631 --> 01:02:16,259
Are you takin'
his part? Huh?

750
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:19,496
I'm the one
who got cheated!

751
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:24,303
You goddamn pimps!
You all in it together.

752
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:27,776
Nobody's in anything.
Ike, you're drunk.
Go on home and sleep it off.

753
01:02:27,845 --> 01:02:30,609
Get your goddamn hands off me!

754
01:02:30,681 --> 01:02:33,206
Don't you ever put
your hands on me, see?

755
01:02:33,284 --> 01:02:36,947
Don't you ever try to manhandle
a Cowboy, 'cause we'll cut
your goddamn pimp's heart out.

756
01:02:37,021 --> 01:02:40,149
- Understand me, pimp?
- Don't you threaten me,
you little son-of-a-bitch!

757
01:02:40,224 --> 01:02:42,784
All right! All right!
Come on, easy, Virg, easy!

758
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:45,829
You just go on home and
forget about it, huh, Ike?

759
01:02:45,896 --> 01:02:48,364
Come on, Virg.

760
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:50,866
I ain't gonna forget nothin'.

761
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:55,565
Well, that certainly was a bust.

762
01:02:55,639 --> 01:03:00,906
Come, darlin'. Let's seek
our entertainment elsewhere.

763
01:03:00,978 --> 01:03:04,141
Forget it, Virg. Go on.
Get some fresh air.

764
01:03:15,593 --> 01:03:17,527
What's wrong, Doc?

765
01:03:17,595 --> 01:03:19,859
Nothin'. Not a thing.

766
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:22,558
I'm right as the mail.

767
01:03:25,736 --> 01:03:28,000
Doc? Doc!

768
01:03:28,072 --> 01:03:31,269
All right, get him up.
Let's get him to the hotel.

769
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:42,877
- What's wrong with him?
- Lunger.

770
01:03:42,953 --> 01:03:45,751
Yeah, well, I hope you die.

771
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:49,349
Give me my guns.

772
01:03:51,395 --> 01:03:53,329
My rifle.

773
01:03:53,397 --> 01:03:56,525
Goddamn bastards.
Think they can cheat me.

774
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,659
Nobody cheated you, Ike.
Just go home.

775
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:03,571
I don't take no mouth
from no bartenders, neither.

776
01:04:03,641 --> 01:04:05,575
There, ya see?

777
01:04:05,643 --> 01:04:09,101
Give somebody a rap on the beezer,
get some respect around here.

778
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:13,548
You tell the Earps, I see 'em
on the street and Doc Holliday,

779
01:04:13,617 --> 01:04:17,314
I'm gonna send them to hell
on a shutter. You tell 'em that...

780
01:04:23,327 --> 01:04:25,761
Pick these guns up.

781
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:27,763
Come on.

782
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:45,104
Come on, Ike.

783
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:47,173
Come on!

784
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:52,119
- Hey, you walkin'?
- Leave me alone.

785
01:04:58,629 --> 01:05:01,427
- You gonna give Ike back his guns.
- Not 'til he sobers up.

786
01:05:01,498 --> 01:05:05,264
Wearin' that badge
don't make you right.

787
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:07,929
Who the hell
you think you are?

788
01:05:11,175 --> 01:05:15,635
- Watch the way you walk,
you stupid bastard.
- Easy, kid, I'm sorry.

789
01:05:15,713 --> 01:05:18,341
I ain't easy
and I ain't your kid.

790
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:21,782
You take your sorry
and shove it up your ass.

791
01:05:24,888 --> 01:05:27,015
I'll fight you right now.

792
01:05:33,564 --> 01:05:35,498
Goddammit!

793
01:05:35,566 --> 01:05:37,534
You're gonna bleed.

794
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:41,037
You got a fight comin'.
Comin' today.

795
01:05:45,042 --> 01:05:47,977
Bastards! We're comin'!

796
01:05:55,085 --> 01:05:57,610
Your condition's
quite advanced.

797
01:05:57,688 --> 01:06:01,852
I'd say you lost some 60%
of your lung tissue, maybe more.

798
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:03,859
What's the verdict?

799
01:06:03,927 --> 01:06:08,830
Two years. Two days.
Hard to say, if you stop now:

800
01:06:08,899 --> 01:06:11,800
Your smokin',
your drinkin',

801
01:06:11,869 --> 01:06:14,133
your gamblin',
your night life.

802
01:06:14,204 --> 01:06:17,002
You need complete rest.

803
01:06:18,408 --> 01:06:22,640
What I mean is,
you must attempt to, uh, deny...

804
01:06:22,713 --> 01:06:27,207
- your, uh, marital impulse.
- Get out of my sight.

805
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:48,503
- How are you feeling, Doc?
- Mmm, better.

806
01:06:48,572 --> 01:06:50,938
That's good.

807
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:53,841
I knew it wasn't nothing.

808
01:06:55,145 --> 01:06:57,670
We must talk, darlin'.

809
01:06:59,082 --> 01:07:01,414
It appears, uh...

810
01:07:01,485 --> 01:07:06,787
we must redefine the nature
of our association.

811
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:14,697
I'm a good woman
to you, Doc.

812
01:07:14,765 --> 01:07:17,325
Don't I always
take care of ya?

813
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:20,302
Nobody cares for you
like me.

814
01:07:21,405 --> 01:07:23,600
I'm a good woman.

815
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:29,101
Yes, it's true,
you are a good woman.

816
01:07:41,658 --> 01:07:44,024
Then again...

817
01:07:44,094 --> 01:07:48,698
you may be the Antichrist.

818
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:12,013
Goddamn.

819
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:16,616
Now there's six of 'em.
Hell, this is like a bad dream.

820
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:19,991
Just stay calm. Use your head.
It'll be all right.

821
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:25,460
Just the same, though...

822
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:29,805
Guess maybe you better
swear me in.

823
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:09,210
Those Cowboys been telling everybody
in town they're gonna clean you out.

824
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:12,736
They're back there in that lot
behind the O.K. Corral.

825
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:16,641
- Thank you, Mayor.
- What're you doin' out of bed, Doc?

826
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:19,119
What in the hell's goin' on?
Five people come up to my room...

827
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:23,215
tellin' me the Clantons and McLaurys
are gunnin' for us.

828
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:27,854
- We goin' down there or not?
What are we gonna do?
- Wait 'til the liquor wears off.

829
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:30,455
Soon as they start gettin' headaches,
they'll lose interest.

830
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:33,730
Lose interest, hell.
They're threatenin' our lives.

831
01:09:33,803 --> 01:09:37,102
- You'll never make that stick.
- They're carryin' guns, Wyatt.

832
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,107
Christ's sake, Virg,
that's a misdemeanor.

833
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,872
You go arrest them, something
goes wrong, maybe somebody
really gets his head broken.

834
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:46,403
You'll have Cowboys
comin' around lookin' for
trouble from here to Christmas.

835
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:49,918
- You want to risk all that
over a misdemeanor?
- Damn right I'll risk it.

836
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:52,385
They're breakin' the law.

837
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:01,528
It's not your problem, Doc.
You don't have to mix up in this.

838
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:07,532
That is a hell of a thing
for you to say to me.

839
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,513
All right, Virg.

840
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:25,985
Your call.
Give Doc the shotgun.

841
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,350
They'll be less apt
to get nerv-i-ous...

842
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:31,655
if he's on
the street howitzer.

843
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:17,338
Hey! Bang bang
bang bang bang!

844
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:20,034
Go on! Get home!

845
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:23,635
Goddamn kid.

846
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:37,685
How the hell did we
get ourselves into this?

847
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:43,792
You don't have to worry about a thing.
I just disarmed them.

848
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:46,460
You did?
Come on, boys.

849
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:49,834
Gentlemen, I'm not
gonna allow any trouble.

850
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:16,654
We're here to disarm you.
Throw up your hands.

851
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:23,167
Hold it!
That's not what I want!

852
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:59,407
Oh, my God.

853
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:10,947
Billy! Billy!

854
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:20,027
Stop! No! No!

855
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:22,825
Don't shoot!
I got no gun!

856
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:26,197
- Please don't shoot me!
I got no gun!
- This fight's commenced!

857
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:28,532
Get to fightin' or get away!

858
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:32,997
- Unh!
- Shut the door!

859
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:39,847
Aah!

860
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:50,757
Give me your goddamned gun!
Damn it!

861
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:53,294
Billy! Billy!

862
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:55,694
Doc, behind us!

863
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:24,749
I got you now,
you son-of-a-bitch.

864
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:26,761
You're a daisy if you do.

865
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:43,468
Morgan, hold quiet now.

866
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:56,950
Here you go.
Easy. Easy, man.

867
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:59,823
- I got you. All right.
- All right!

868
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:04,357
All of you
are under arrest.

869
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:18,912
I don't think I'll let you
arrest us today, Behan.

870
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:49,610
Virg!

871
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:52,238
- Virgil!

872
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:15,336
Well, I guess we did
our good deed for today, Mayor.

873
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:43,583
You were right.
It's nothin' like I thought.

874
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:47,151
- I almost wish that...
- I know, Morgan.

875
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:50,957
I know. Me too.

876
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:05,405
Outta the way!
Yee-haw!

877
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:11,519
Gettin' warmer.

878
01:18:11,587 --> 01:18:14,147
Guess spring's comin'.

879
01:18:14,223 --> 01:18:19,024
- Hello, Billy. I say hello.
- It's deputy! And I don't
want to talk to you!

880
01:18:19,094 --> 01:18:21,358
Those men you killed
were my friends.

881
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:25,526
I'm just a nothin'. But if
I wasn't, I'd fight you right now,

882
01:18:25,601 --> 01:18:28,001
so I don't
want to talk to you.

883
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:32,537
All they ever did
was laugh at him.

884
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:44,781
Sister boy should've
stuck around.

885
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:50,992
- What do you want, Ringo?
- I want your blood.

886
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,961
And I want your souls.

887
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:57,726
And I want 'em both right now.

888
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:01,167
- I don't want any more trouble.
- Well, ya got trouble!

889
01:19:02,805 --> 01:19:05,899
And it starts with you.

890
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:12,038
I'm not gonna
fight you, Ringo.

891
01:19:13,348 --> 01:19:15,509
There's no money in it.

892
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,882
Sober up.
Come on, boys.

893
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:20,387
You wretched slugs.

894
01:19:20,456 --> 01:19:23,857
Don't any of ya have the guts
to play for blood?

895
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:26,417
I'm your huckleberry.

896
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:29,896
That's just my game.

897
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:42,033
All right, lunger.
You go to hell.

898
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:46,445
- I'll put you out of your misery.
- Say when.

899
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:50,144
- Johnny, don't!
- No, Johnny! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

900
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:52,244
- Get off!
- Easy now! It ain't nothin'.

901
01:19:52,321 --> 01:19:54,949
- Get off!
- Don't mind him!

902
01:19:55,023 --> 01:19:58,049
He's just drunk,
that's all.

903
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:01,255
Cool down, Johnny!

904
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:03,924
No! No!

905
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:06,797
I want them spittin' blood!

906
01:20:06,869 --> 01:20:10,168
- Easy, son, easy!
Now ain't the time!
- Slow down, Ringo.

907
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:16,805
I tell ya, boys, even I'm wary
of what's gonna happen
once Ringo runs this outfit.

908
01:20:16,879 --> 01:20:19,575
God have mercy!

909
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:23,607
Juanito, their time will come.
- Gentlemen.

910
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:26,620
- You can pull it, boy!
- Let's go get sauced!

911
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:28,883
- Barber.
- Yes, sir?

912
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:33,127
Proceed, sir.

913
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:53,480
Listen to me.
I need to speak with you.

914
01:20:53,549 --> 01:20:56,074
Not now. I'm busy.

915
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:58,949
I see what's going on
between you and Wyatt.

916
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:02,752
I'm not a fool.
And listen to me.

917
01:21:02,825 --> 01:21:07,524
Lots of so-called hard cases and
tough nuts come and go around this town,

918
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:12,033
but none of them has a clue
about the real play... none of them.

919
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:15,695
Now after tonight, there'll be one man
in charge of Tombstone.

920
01:21:15,771 --> 01:21:19,867
You'll be happy to know him.
Bet on it.

921
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:30,881
Gonna be one of those nights.

922
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:36,820
It's gettin' late, boys.
I'm gonna go to bed.

923
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,827
- Good night, Virg.
- Good night, Morg.

924
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:43,661
Bundle up, Virg.
It's gettin' cold out there.

925
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:45,597
Yeah.

926
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:15,261
Tower of Babel.

927
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:17,821
Death and the Devil.

928
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:22,394
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, Allie. I wish you'd learn
to play a real card game.

929
01:22:27,009 --> 01:22:29,773
- More tea, Mattie?
- Mm-mmm. No, no.

930
01:22:29,845 --> 01:22:31,779
- Are you all right, Mattie?
- Yes.

931
01:22:31,847 --> 01:22:34,475
- Are you expecting someone?
- Only Virg.

932
01:22:39,755 --> 01:22:43,122
Please. I know it's awful
to come here, but listen.

933
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:45,819
I think something's
gonna happen tonight.

934
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:50,421
It's Virg.

935
01:22:50,499 --> 01:22:53,127
- No! Get down!

936
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:13,418
That thunder's
sure gettin' close.

937
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:28,565
Virgil. What'd ya forget?

938
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:42,082
Wyatt.

939
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:57,256
Will you hurry
with that water, please?

940
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:59,493
Come on, Lou.

941
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,597
Wyatt! Wyatt!

942
01:24:06,842 --> 01:24:09,640
They hit Claude's house too,
shot up his wife.

943
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:11,872
His wife!
Whoever heard of that?

944
01:24:11,947 --> 01:24:15,178
They're bugs, Wyatt. All that
smart talk about live and let live.

945
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:17,184
There ain't no live
and let live with bugs.

946
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:19,584
All right, you listen to me now.
We gotta get out of here.

947
01:24:19,654 --> 01:24:22,714
Get out of here?
Listen to yourself, Wyatt.

948
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:25,624
Lie down and crawl or you might
get hurt? What kind of talk is that?

949
01:24:25,694 --> 01:24:27,685
- Do you see what's happening here?
- What?

950
01:24:27,763 --> 01:24:31,028
What do you mean?
What are you saying?

951
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:33,033
No. Please, no.

952
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:36,400
I'm afraid your husband's
going to lose the use of his arm.

953
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:39,031
Oh, God, no.

954
01:24:39,107 --> 01:24:42,167
Don't worry, Allie girl.

955
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:45,577
I still got one good arm
to hold you with.

956
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:49,342
Goddamn...

957
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:53,979
- Goddamn sons-of-bitches!
- Morgan, wait a minute! Virg...

958
01:24:54,055 --> 01:24:56,421
- You had to be so damned smart.
- I'm sorry, Allie.

959
01:24:56,491 --> 01:24:58,755
I told you, Virg.

960
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:01,125
- Not now, Wyatt.
- All right.

961
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:03,357
- All right, what do you want me to do?

962
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:07,424
- Just leave me alone, for God's sakes.
- Virg...

963
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:10,471
He doesn't want
to talk now, Wyatt!

964
01:25:26,554 --> 01:25:30,285
I heard about what they did
to your women. That was wrong.

965
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:34,556
I'm here to let you know that it
wasn't me. I had no part of it.

966
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:38,963
No? Brothers to the bone,
right, McMasters?

967
01:25:39,033 --> 01:25:43,265
No. Not anymore.
Not after this night.

968
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:47,741
He's right, Wyatt. You want us
for anything, we're with you.

969
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:49,777
Come on.

970
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:55,075
Hold him!

971
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:59,079
- No! Get her out of here! Jesus!

972
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:03,379
- Somebody shut that dog up!

973
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,714
- I said hold him, goddammit!

974
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:11,418
- Somebody get that
goddamn dog out of here!

975
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:14,950
The bullet's too deep.
I can't get it out.

976
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:19,826
- The way it's lodged
in there... I'm sorry.

977
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,995
Easy, Morg.
Is that better?

978
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,006
Yeah.

979
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:32,774
You were right, Wyatt.
They got me good.

980
01:27:34,616 --> 01:27:38,882
Don't let 'em get you, brother.
You're the one.

981
01:27:39,954 --> 01:27:42,787
Easy, Morg.

982
01:27:42,857 --> 01:27:45,917
Don't worry about that, now.

983
01:27:49,797 --> 01:27:53,130
Remember what I said
about seein' a light when you're dyin'?

984
01:27:53,201 --> 01:27:56,659
Yeah. Yeah.

985
01:27:56,738 --> 01:27:58,899
That ain't true.

986
01:27:58,973 --> 01:28:01,908
I can't see a damn thing.

987
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:06,880
Morg?

988
01:28:11,252 --> 01:28:13,186
Morg!

989
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:20,794
Morg?

990
01:28:34,842 --> 01:28:36,776
No.

991
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:41,214
Morgan! No!

992
01:28:41,282 --> 01:28:44,979
Morgan, don't die!
I love you!

993
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:47,112
Don't die!

994
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:02,961
Why? Why him?

995
01:29:06,307 --> 01:29:10,573
- No. No, get away from me!
- Wyatt!

996
01:29:11,746 --> 01:29:14,840
Can't you see?
Get away from me!

997
01:29:49,851 --> 01:29:52,649
Morgan!

998
01:30:43,738 --> 01:30:46,730
And so she walked
out of our lives forever.

999
01:31:05,092 --> 01:31:07,026
Giddup!

1000
01:31:21,342 --> 01:31:24,834
Want you to know it's over.

1001
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:29,308
Well.

1002
01:31:29,383 --> 01:31:31,351
Bye.

1003
01:31:33,354 --> 01:31:36,016
You smell that, Bill?

1004
01:31:37,625 --> 01:31:39,786
Smells like someone died.

1005
01:31:41,362 --> 01:31:45,059
Jesus, Johnny.

1006
01:31:55,042 --> 01:31:57,943
- Giddyap!

1007
01:31:58,012 --> 01:32:00,947
Adios, cabrones.

1008
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:09,155
Ike.

1009
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:13,692
Take Stillwell and finish it.

1010
01:32:29,176 --> 01:32:32,634
Now, you take care of yourself...

1011
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:36,376
- That's Virgil with the women.
- He's mine!

1012
01:32:36,450 --> 01:32:39,817
- All aboard!
- Hey, Mattie! Where's Wyatt?

1013
01:32:39,887 --> 01:32:42,515
Right behind you, Stillwell.

1014
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:44,751
- Aah!
- No!

1015
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,574
Sweet Jesus.

1016
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,785
All right, Clanton.

1017
01:33:21,862 --> 01:33:25,992
You called down the thunder.
Well, now you got it.

1018
01:33:27,968 --> 01:33:31,904
You see that? It says,
'United States Marshal.'

1019
01:33:31,972 --> 01:33:34,497
Wyatt.
Please don't kill me. Please.

1020
01:33:34,575 --> 01:33:38,875
Take a good look at him, Ike,
'cause that's how you're gonna end up.

1021
01:33:41,014 --> 01:33:43,574
The Cowboys are finished.
You understand me?

1022
01:33:43,650 --> 01:33:47,177
I see a red sash,
I kill the man wearin' it.

1023
01:33:47,254 --> 01:33:49,279
So run, you cur.

1024
01:33:50,557 --> 01:33:55,221
Run! Tell all the other curs
the law is comin'!

1025
01:33:55,295 --> 01:33:57,627
You tell 'em I'm comin'!

1026
01:33:57,698 --> 01:34:00,633
And hell's comin'
with me, you hear?

1027
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:03,499
Hell's comin' with me!

1028
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:38,571
Nobody move!

1029
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:42,097
- Nonsense. By all means, move.
-

1030
01:35:56,016 --> 01:35:58,780
-
- Get down!

1031
01:36:09,896 --> 01:36:13,024
Hey, Wyatt!

1032
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:15,261
How the hell are ya?

1033
01:36:21,708 --> 01:36:24,370
Ohh!

1034
01:36:27,614 --> 01:36:29,878
I got some boys
over there behind ya!

1035
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:32,919
Got you in a little crossfire.
How do ya like that?

1036
01:36:35,789 --> 01:36:38,758
Come on! Think of
something fast, would ya?

1037
01:36:40,961 --> 01:36:45,227
Wyatt?
Hey, Wyatt.

1038
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:47,267
- No.
- Wyatt!

1039
01:36:49,236 --> 01:36:51,363
- No.
- Wyatt, what are you doin'?

1040
01:36:51,438 --> 01:36:53,770
Look at that.

1041
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,809
Yeah.

1042
01:36:56,877 --> 01:36:59,243
Come and get some, boy.

1043
01:37:04,184 --> 01:37:06,243
No! Let me!

1044
01:37:12,059 --> 01:37:15,222
- No.

1045
01:37:15,295 --> 01:37:19,061
- Son-of-a-bitch.
- No!

1046
01:37:24,104 --> 01:37:26,072
Jesus Christ!

1047
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:32,835
Yaahh!

1048
01:37:36,116 --> 01:37:38,778
No. No!

1049
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:53,656
Did you ever see anything
like that before?

1050
01:37:53,734 --> 01:37:57,295
- Hell, I ain't never even
heard of anything like that.
- Nothin'.

1051
01:37:58,372 --> 01:38:00,306
Where is he?

1052
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:03,810
Down by the creek,

1053
01:38:03,910 --> 01:38:06,208
walkin' on water.

1054
01:38:06,279 --> 01:38:09,544
Well, let's hope he's got
another miracle up his sleeve.

1055
01:38:09,616 --> 01:38:13,609
'Cause if I know Ringo,
he's headed straight for us.

1056
01:38:13,687 --> 01:38:18,021
Well, if they were my brothers,
I'd want revenge too.

1057
01:38:18,091 --> 01:38:20,821
No. Make no mistake.

1058
01:38:20,894 --> 01:38:24,193
It's not revenge he's after.

1059
01:38:26,066 --> 01:38:28,296
It's a reckoning.

1060
01:38:38,512 --> 01:38:43,142
Doc. You ought to be in bed. What
the hell you doin' this for anyway?

1061
01:38:43,216 --> 01:38:45,707
Wyatt Earp is my friend.

1062
01:38:45,786 --> 01:38:48,949
Hell, I got lots of friends.

1063
01:38:50,957 --> 01:38:53,050
I don't.

1064
01:39:03,403 --> 01:39:06,566
Whoa! Whoa!

1065
01:39:11,611 --> 01:39:13,545
My God.

1066
01:39:16,683 --> 01:39:19,584
- Are you all right?
- What do you care?

1067
01:39:19,653 --> 01:39:22,019
It was your friends
that did it.

1068
01:39:24,224 --> 01:39:27,887
Must've been Claiborne and Fuller.
They left here last night.

1069
01:39:27,961 --> 01:39:30,759
Aw, no.

1070
01:39:30,831 --> 01:39:33,664
They tried to take my watch.

1071
01:39:33,733 --> 01:39:37,635
He cursed them for cowards,
and they shot him.

1072
01:39:38,705 --> 01:39:42,505
I don't understand
any of this.

1073
01:39:42,576 --> 01:39:45,044
I just know it's ugly.

1074
01:39:45,111 --> 01:39:47,705
You're all ugly,

1075
01:39:47,781 --> 01:39:51,376
and he was beautiful.

1076
01:39:51,451 --> 01:39:55,751
He tried to bring something
fine into your ugly world,
and you shot him for it.

1077
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:01,985
Not that you care.

1078
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:16,837
- Billy. Where you goin'?
- I'm not goin' with you.

1079
01:40:16,910 --> 01:40:19,208
Billy!
Billy, get back here!

1080
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:21,839
I'm sorry, sir,
but we got to have some law.

1081
01:40:21,915 --> 01:40:25,749
- Billy!
- Let him go. Who cares?

1082
01:40:25,819 --> 01:40:29,152
Yaahh! Get the hell
outta here! Go on!

1083
01:40:29,222 --> 01:40:32,055
Party's over, boys.
Let's go!

1084
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:48,874
Whoa.

1085
01:40:54,379 --> 01:40:57,542
Ringo and Behan
are out front.

1086
01:40:57,616 --> 01:41:01,643
There is about 30 of 'em.

1087
01:41:02,787 --> 01:41:04,721
They're all wearin' badges.

1088
01:41:06,658 --> 01:41:08,853
Christ.

1089
01:41:08,927 --> 01:41:13,057
We gotta find
a place to hole up.

1090
01:41:13,131 --> 01:41:15,258
Doc.

1091
01:41:15,333 --> 01:41:17,267
Grab him.

1092
01:41:19,537 --> 01:41:21,471
I got him.

1093
01:41:22,107 --> 01:41:24,041
I got him!

1094
01:41:29,648 --> 01:41:31,582
Is this Henry Hooker's ranch?

1095
01:41:31,650 --> 01:41:34,312
That's right.
And I'm Hooker.

1096
01:41:34,386 --> 01:41:36,684
We got a sick man.

1097
01:41:36,755 --> 01:41:38,746
And our horses are done in.

1098
01:41:38,823 --> 01:41:41,189
Put him up at my place,

1099
01:41:41,259 --> 01:41:43,386
as long as it's just tonight.

1100
01:41:43,461 --> 01:41:45,429
We're in debt to ya.

1101
01:41:52,704 --> 01:41:58,199
I know you boys have got to keep movin',
but he looks pretty bad to me.

1102
01:42:01,546 --> 01:42:05,505
- Whoa!
- I, uh...

1103
01:42:26,071 --> 01:42:29,336
They got held up,
and their boss actor got killed.

1104
01:42:29,407 --> 01:42:32,706
They came here to water the horses,
then they'll push on.

1105
01:42:49,994 --> 01:42:53,930
I'm sorry about your friend.
And I'm... I'm sorry that I...

1106
01:42:53,998 --> 01:42:57,229
I forgave you
the moment you said it.

1107
01:42:57,302 --> 01:43:00,032
You did? Well...

1108
01:43:01,272 --> 01:43:03,206
Thank you.

1109
01:43:04,542 --> 01:43:06,601
All set.

1110
01:43:08,646 --> 01:43:10,944
I have to go.

1111
01:43:13,585 --> 01:43:15,553
Wait.

1112
01:43:35,273 --> 01:43:37,241
- Hyah!

1113
01:43:37,308 --> 01:43:39,503
Giddup!

1114
01:44:01,533 --> 01:44:03,967
What the hell is that?

1115
01:44:23,721 --> 01:44:26,656
They got McMasters!

1116
01:44:26,724 --> 01:44:29,056
Geez!

1117
01:44:29,127 --> 01:44:31,721
Ringo wanted to make sure
he got your attention, Marshal!

1118
01:44:31,796 --> 01:44:34,788
He wants a straight-up fight,
just you and him,

1119
01:44:34,866 --> 01:44:37,130
to settle this thing
once and for all.

1120
01:44:37,202 --> 01:44:40,831
Oak grove at the mouth
of Silver Springs canyon, 7:00!

1121
01:44:40,905 --> 01:44:43,840
You tell him I'll be there!

1122
01:44:43,908 --> 01:44:47,503
- Are you crazy?
- I'll be there!

1123
01:44:47,579 --> 01:44:50,070
It's not finished.

1124
01:45:05,029 --> 01:45:08,123
After I'm done
with Wyatt Earp,

1125
01:45:08,199 --> 01:45:13,136
take your Cowboys and finish off
Creek Johnson and Texas Jack.

1126
01:45:14,572 --> 01:45:16,563
You burn 'em, Ike.

1127
01:45:18,743 --> 01:45:23,407
- Burn 'em all.
- Hell, Johnny,
he ain't even gonna show.

1128
01:45:23,481 --> 01:45:25,608
Giddap!

1129
01:45:25,683 --> 01:45:28,345
He'll show.

1130
01:45:30,922 --> 01:45:35,188
I spent my whole life not knowin'
what I wanted outta life,

1131
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:37,751
just chasin' my tail.

1132
01:45:37,829 --> 01:45:41,526
Now for the first time
I know exactly what I want,

1133
01:45:41,599 --> 01:45:43,999
and who.

1134
01:45:45,103 --> 01:45:47,970
And that's
the damnable misery of it.

1135
01:45:52,911 --> 01:45:55,573
What makes a man
like Ringo, Doc?

1136
01:45:55,647 --> 01:45:58,639
What makes him
do the things he does?

1137
01:45:58,716 --> 01:46:01,480
A man like Ringo...

1138
01:46:01,553 --> 01:46:05,785
got a great empty hole
right through the middle of him.

1139
01:46:07,225 --> 01:46:12,026
He can never kill enough
or steal enough...

1140
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:14,963
or inflict enough pain
to ever fill it.

1141
01:46:15,033 --> 01:46:17,467
What does he need?

1142
01:46:18,670 --> 01:46:20,604
Revenge.

1143
01:46:23,908 --> 01:46:26,502
For what?

1144
01:46:31,282 --> 01:46:33,216
Bein' born.

1145
01:46:47,065 --> 01:46:49,090
It all happened so fast
with Curly Bill...

1146
01:46:49,167 --> 01:46:51,260
I didn't really have time
to think about it,

1147
01:46:51,336 --> 01:46:53,827
but I've had plenty of time
to think about this.

1148
01:47:01,045 --> 01:47:03,513
I can't beat him, can I?

1149
01:47:05,483 --> 01:47:07,644
No.

1150
01:47:13,691 --> 01:47:17,627
Wait.
I'm goin' with ya.

1151
01:47:23,134 --> 01:47:27,161
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

1152
01:47:27,238 --> 01:47:29,433
I'm sorry, Wyatt.

1153
01:47:29,507 --> 01:47:32,032
It's all right, Doc.

1154
01:47:35,179 --> 01:47:38,114
What's it like to wear
one of those?

1155
01:48:05,576 --> 01:48:07,510
Don't worry.

1156
01:48:07,578 --> 01:48:10,775
They want him,
they gotta come over us first.

1157
01:48:36,908 --> 01:48:41,902
He's waitin' for you by the big oak,
quarter mile up that trail.

1158
01:48:47,452 --> 01:48:50,751
They're not givin' ya
any safe conduct.

1159
01:48:50,822 --> 01:48:55,088
Shootin' starts, you better kick east
to the New Mexico line.

1160
01:48:57,595 --> 01:48:59,859
I ain't got the words.

1161
01:48:59,931 --> 01:49:02,525
I know.

1162
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:04,932
Me neither.

1163
01:49:12,510 --> 01:49:14,444
Well.

1164
01:49:20,518 --> 01:49:23,722
I didn't think
ya had it in you.

1165
01:49:23,855 --> 01:49:26,756
I'm your huckleberry.

1166
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:32,261
Why, Johnny Ringo,

1167
01:49:32,330 --> 01:49:36,391
you look like somebody
just walked over your grave.

1168
01:49:37,469 --> 01:49:40,404
Fight's not with you, Holliday.

1169
01:49:40,472 --> 01:49:45,171
I'll beg to differ, sir. We started
a game we never got to finish.

1170
01:49:46,244 --> 01:49:48,610
Play for blood, remember?

1171
01:49:49,848 --> 01:49:53,079
I was just foolin' about.

1172
01:49:54,686 --> 01:49:56,620
I wasn't.

1173
01:49:58,022 --> 01:50:00,217
And this time...

1174
01:50:01,426 --> 01:50:04,020
it's legal.

1175
01:50:11,269 --> 01:50:15,171
All right, lunger.
Let's do it.

1176
01:50:48,606 --> 01:50:50,540
Say when.

1177
01:51:08,893 --> 01:51:12,886
Come on. Come on!

1178
01:51:12,964 --> 01:51:16,127
Oh, Johnny. Come on!

1179
01:51:20,972 --> 01:51:24,499
You're no daisy.
You're no daisy at all!

1180
01:51:25,643 --> 01:51:28,043
Poor soul.

1181
01:51:28,112 --> 01:51:31,013
You were just
too high-strung.

1182
01:51:40,959 --> 01:51:45,987
I'm afraid the strain
was more than he could bear.

1183
01:51:52,837 --> 01:51:57,365
Oh, I wasn't quite
as sick as I made out.

1184
01:51:59,811 --> 01:52:02,371
Good God.

1185
01:52:08,853 --> 01:52:11,754
My hypocrisy
goes only so far.

1186
01:52:16,761 --> 01:52:18,729
All right.

1187
01:52:18,796 --> 01:52:21,287
Let's finish it.

1188
01:52:21,366 --> 01:52:26,702
Indeed, sir. The last charge
of Wyatt Earp and his immortals.

1189
01:53:18,423 --> 01:53:21,358
Hyah! Hyah, come on!

1190
01:53:22,961 --> 01:53:25,896
No! Here!

1191
01:53:25,964 --> 01:53:27,898
Look at this!

1192
01:54:48,379 --> 01:54:50,313
Hello, Wyatt.

1193
01:54:50,381 --> 01:54:53,873
Father Feeney
and I were just...

1194
01:54:53,951 --> 01:54:59,321
investigating the mysteries
of the church of Rome.

1195
01:55:00,424 --> 01:55:05,828
It appears my hypocrisy
knows no bounds.

1196
01:55:05,896 --> 01:55:09,992
You're no hypocrite, Doc.
You just like to sound like one.

1197
01:55:10,067 --> 01:55:12,695
I brought you somethin'.

1198
01:55:18,309 --> 01:55:22,006
Well, let's see.
Where are we today?

1199
01:55:22,079 --> 01:55:25,640
I'm $17 down to you.

1200
01:55:25,716 --> 01:55:29,379
- Two bits a hand. Stud?
- You keep comin' back here.

1201
01:55:29,453 --> 01:55:32,217
I told you not to,
and I meant it.

1202
01:55:32,290 --> 01:55:35,851
You're the only person
I can afford to lose to anymore.

1203
01:55:38,629 --> 01:55:42,121
How we feelin' today, Doc?

1204
01:55:42,199 --> 01:55:44,963
I'm dying. How are you?

1205
01:55:45,036 --> 01:55:47,596
Pretty much the same.

1206
01:55:47,672 --> 01:55:52,234
- So now we add self-pity
to our list of frailties.
- All right, Doc.

1207
01:55:52,310 --> 01:55:55,643
All right, how many
cards you want?

1208
01:55:55,713 --> 01:55:59,012
I don't want
to play anymore.

1209
01:55:59,083 --> 01:56:01,813
How many?

1210
01:56:01,886 --> 01:56:06,914
Damn you.
You're the most fallible,

1211
01:56:06,991 --> 01:56:09,926
stubborn, self-deluded,

1212
01:56:09,994 --> 01:56:13,589
- bullheaded man I've ever
known in my entire life.
- I call.

1213
01:56:14,665 --> 01:56:16,895
- You win.
- Yet with all,

1214
01:56:16,967 --> 01:56:21,529
you're the only human being
in my entire life who ever gave me hope.

1215
01:56:28,179 --> 01:56:31,615
I was in love once.

1216
01:56:32,683 --> 01:56:34,708
My first cousin.

1217
01:56:34,785 --> 01:56:38,243
She was 15.

1218
01:56:40,624 --> 01:56:42,922
We were both so...

1219
01:56:43,994 --> 01:56:46,394
That's good, Doc.

1220
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:49,160
That's... That's good.
What happened?

1221
01:56:52,303 --> 01:56:55,966
She joined a convent
over the affair.

1222
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:58,975
She was all I ever wanted.

1223
01:57:00,678 --> 01:57:03,146
What did you want?

1224
01:57:03,214 --> 01:57:06,479
Just to live a normal life.

1225
01:57:06,550 --> 01:57:11,351
There's no normal life, Wyatt.
There's just life.

1226
01:57:11,422 --> 01:57:14,323
Now get on with it.

1227
01:57:14,392 --> 01:57:16,485
Don't know how.

1228
01:57:18,396 --> 01:57:22,162
Sure you do.
Say good-bye to me.

1229
01:57:23,401 --> 01:57:26,063
Go grab
that spirited actress...

1230
01:57:26,137 --> 01:57:29,436
and make her your own.

1231
01:57:29,507 --> 01:57:32,670
Take that beauty and run,
and don't look back.

1232
01:57:32,743 --> 01:57:37,043
Live every second.
Live right up to the hilt.

1233
01:57:37,114 --> 01:57:39,082
Live, Wyatt.

1234
01:57:40,217 --> 01:57:42,276
Live for me.

1235
01:57:43,621 --> 01:57:46,351
Wyatt? If you
ever were my friend,

1236
01:57:46,424 --> 01:57:49,689
if you ever had even
the slightest feelin' for me,

1237
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:52,251
leave now.

1238
01:57:52,329 --> 01:57:54,320
Leave now.

1239
01:57:58,669 --> 01:58:01,467
Please?

1240
01:58:12,082 --> 01:58:14,812
Thanks for always
bein' there, Doc.

1241
01:58:42,780 --> 01:58:44,805
I'll be damned.

1242
01:58:47,485 --> 01:58:50,420
This is funny.

1243
01:59:09,974 --> 01:59:15,412
I never thought I would see
Gilbert and Sullivan performed
right here in Denver.

1244
01:59:15,479 --> 01:59:18,676
- Good night, Josie.
- Good night.

1245
01:59:18,749 --> 01:59:20,683
Good show.

1246
01:59:37,101 --> 01:59:40,662
Ya ever see the sun come up
over the Rockies?

1247
01:59:40,738 --> 01:59:45,141
It hits all of a sudden,
and below there's California.

1248
01:59:45,209 --> 01:59:48,303
And you swear
you're lookin' at heaven.

1249
01:59:56,153 --> 01:59:58,883
I have nothing left,

1250
01:59:58,956 --> 02:00:01,618
nothing to give you.

1251
02:00:01,692 --> 02:00:06,288
I have no pride,
no dignity.

1252
02:00:06,363 --> 02:00:11,096
No money. I don't even know
how we'll make a living, but...

1253
02:00:14,972 --> 02:00:17,998
I promise I'll love you
the rest of your life.

1254
02:00:33,390 --> 02:00:37,986
Don't worry, Wyatt.
My family's rich.

1255
02:00:44,501 --> 02:00:47,129
What shall we do first?

1256
02:00:47,204 --> 02:00:50,002
What you wanted to do
the first night we met.

1257
02:00:50,074 --> 02:00:52,941
- Remember?
- Uh-uh.

1258
02:00:54,478 --> 02:00:57,845
May I have this dance?

1259
02:00:57,915 --> 02:01:00,008
Yes.

1260
02:01:00,084 --> 02:01:03,019
And then we'll
have room service.

1261
02:01:09,727 --> 02:01:13,390
The power of the Cowboy Gang
was broken forever.

1262
02:01:13,464 --> 02:01:18,231
Ike Clanton was shot
and killed two years later
during an attempted robbery.

1263
02:01:18,302 --> 02:01:23,137
Mattie died of a drug overdose
shortly after she left Tombstone.

1264
02:01:23,207 --> 02:01:26,438
Virgil and Allie Earp
moved to California, where Virgil,

1265
02:01:26,510 --> 02:01:30,139
despite the use of only one arm,
became a town sheriff.

1266
02:01:30,214 --> 02:01:34,173
Wyatt and Josephine
embarked on a series of adventures.

1267
02:01:34,251 --> 02:01:39,553
Up or down, thin or flush,
in 47 years they never left
each other's side.

1268
02:01:39,623 --> 02:01:43,059
Wyatt Earp died
in Los Angeles in 1929.

1269
02:01:43,127 --> 02:01:44,412
Among the pallbearers
at his funeral...

1270
02:01:44,412 --> 02:01:45,970
Among the pallbearers
at his funeral...

1271
02:01:46,046 --> 02:01:50,176
were early Western movie stars
William S. Hart and Tom Mix.

1272
02:01:50,250 --> 02:01:53,219
Tom Mix wept.

1273
02:01:57,409 --> 02:02:28,410
