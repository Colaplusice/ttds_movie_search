with Sicilian women...

a half-nigger kid.

"None of your fucking business."

883
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,787
[ Clarence ] The truth of the matter is,
I got a friend in the department.

884
01:05:13,856 --> 01:05:15,619
What department?

885
01:05:15,692 --> 01:05:19,321
"What department?"
What do you think, eight ball?

886

- The police department?
- Give the man a prize!

887
01:05:22,665 --> 01:05:26,101
About a year and a half ago, this friend
of mine got access to the evidence room,

888
01:05:26,169 --> 01:05:29,161
and he snagged this coke, but he's
a good cop with a wife and a kid.

889
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:31,173
So he held on to it
for about a year and a half,

890

- until he found a guy he could trust.
- And he trusts you?

Yeah. We were in 4-H together.
We've known each other since
childhood. I'm handling sales.

He's my silent partner. He knows if I
get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him.

- Okay? Now, no further, you understand?

894

He's kind of paranoid. I didn't tell
you nothing. You didn't hear nothing.

He's got a couple of guys.
He's been dealing with them for years.

He can play Santa Claus with it

At the price he's paying, he's gonna be
able to afford to just throw it around.

First of all, Lee,
I'm a really big fan of yours.

That's why I wanna open

1462
01:40:05,079 --> 01:40:08,879
- That's right, Lee.
- I gotta tell you,
I really am a big fan.

1463
01:40:08,949 --> 01:40:11,543
Coming Home in a Body Bag
is my favorite movie of all time.

1464
01:40:11,619 --> 01:40:15,055
After Apocalypse Now, I think that
is the best Vietnam movie ever made.

1465
01:40:15,122 --> 01:40:17,613
- Wow. Thank you very much, Clarence.
- Lee.

1466
01:40:17,692 --> 01:40:20,058
- What?
- This guy's packin'.

1467
01:40:20,127 --> 01:40:22,391
Really?

1468
01:40:22,463 --> 01:40:25,398
Well, I've been pretty scared
about this whole thing.

1469
01:40:25,466 --> 01:40:30,403
But I'm fairly confident
you're just here to do business.
I don't want to be a wise guy.

1470
01:40:30,471 --> 01:40:32,837
If you want, I'll take my gun out,
lay it on the table.

1471
01:40:32,907 --> 01:40:35,307
It's up to you.

1472
01:40:37,211 --> 01:40:40,442
Mm, no, I don't think that's necessary.
Boris, be nice.

1473
01:40:40,514 --> 01:40:42,607
Make everybody
some coffee, okay?

1474
01:40:42,683 --> 01:40:45,311
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

1475
01:40:45,386 --> 01:40:47,946
Honey, sit down.
Relax. Relax.

1476
01:40:48,022 --> 01:40:51,150
- Elliot, you look like shit.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1477
01:40:51,225 --> 01:40:53,523
I mean,
it's completely disgusting.

1478
01:40:53,594 --> 01:40:57,189
Um, I need to get a quick signature.
It would be great--

1479
01:40:57,264 --> 01:41:01,633
- Whatever Bonnie wants.
- Okay.

1480
01:41:01,702 --> 01:41:03,863
- [ Lee ] Like my dailies there, Clar?
- [ Chuckles ]

1481
01:41:03,938 --> 01:41:06,634
- Is that what these are?
Yeah, they're great.
- You like 'em?

1482
01:41:06,707 --> 01:41:08,766
Better fuckin' be great.
They cost me enough.

1483
01:41:08,843 --> 01:41:12,176
- What'd that day cost me?
- $357,000.

1484
01:41:12,246 --> 01:41:15,773
Elliot, I swear to God,
somebody is stealing from me.

1485
01:41:15,850 --> 01:41:18,318
[ Clarence ]
What's this one called anyway?

1486
01:41:18,386 --> 01:41:21,844
- It's a sequel to Body Bag.
- Really?

1487
01:41:21,922 --> 01:41:24,152
We don't have a title yet.
What does Joe like?

1488
01:41:24,225 --> 01:41:27,524
Uh, Body Bags II.

1489
01:41:27,595 --> 01:41:31,554
Ooh, that's imaginative.
I've got more taste in my penis.

1490
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:35,227
This guy's really
fuckin' funny.

1491
01:41:35,302 --> 01:41:38,533
You know, most of these movies that win
a lot of Oscars, I can't stand them.

1492
01:41:38,606 --> 01:41:41,370
They're all safe, geriatric
coffee-table dogshit.

1493

We park our cars in the same garage.
It's all right.

1494
01:41:44,879 --> 01:41:48,178
All those assholes make are unwatchable
movies from unreadable books.

1495
01:41:48,249 --> 01:41:51,980
Mad Max, that's a movie. The Good,
the Bad and the Ugly, that's a movie.

1496
01:41:52,052 --> 01:41:56,421
Rio Bravo, that's a movie.
And Coming Home in a Body Bag,
that was a fuckin' movie.

1497
01:41:56,490 --> 01:41:59,391
It was the only movie up to that time
that won a lot of Oscars with balls.

1498
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:02,861
- I mean, since Deer Hunter.
- I don't believe you.

1499
01:42:05,099 --> 01:42:08,262
Do you like a little coffee
with your sugar, or what?

1500
01:42:08,335 --> 01:42:10,667
Lee, I'm not satisfied till
the spoon stands straight up.

1501
01:42:10,738 --> 01:42:13,764
[ Laughing ]
Give me a coffee, will you?

1502
01:42:13,841 --> 01:42:19,780
My Uncle Roger and Uncle Jerry,
both of whom were in 'Nam,
saw Coming Home in a Body Bag.

1503
01:42:19,847 --> 01:42:24,284
They said to me, Clarence,
that is the most accurate
Vietnam film they'd ever seen.

1504
01:42:24,351 --> 01:42:27,616
When veterans in that bullshit war
say that about my project,

1505
01:42:27,688 --> 01:42:29,883
it makes the whole thing
worthwhile.

1506
01:42:29,957 --> 01:42:31,891
Here's to you.

1507
01:42:31,959 --> 01:42:35,156
My friend-- I'm calling you my friend.
I just met you. You know why?

1508
01:42:35,229 --> 01:42:37,356
I think 'cause we got
the same interests.

1509
01:42:37,431 --> 01:42:41,629
You know what I'd like to do right now?
I'd like to see Dr.Zhivago.

1510
01:42:41,702 --> 01:42:44,603
- [ Chuckles ]
- Where is it?

1511
01:42:44,672 --> 01:42:47,266
Is there a fucking doctor
in the house, or what?

1512
01:42:47,341 --> 01:42:49,901
Hang on a second. Lee, when you
see this, you are gonna shit.

1513
01:42:49,977 --> 01:42:51,911
- [ Lee ] I better.
- Bingo.

1514
01:42:56,250 --> 01:42:58,548
- What's the guy's name?
- Donowitz.

1515
01:43:03,324 --> 01:43:06,088
When somebody loves you

1516
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:10,529
It's no good
unless you love them

1517
01:43:12,633 --> 01:43:15,033
Uh, Lee, that is all
practically uncut.

1518
01:43:15,102 --> 01:43:17,832
If you so desire, you can cut that
a hell of a lot more.

1519
01:43:17,905 --> 01:43:21,170
Don't worry. I'll desire. Boris,
get me another cup of coffee, will you?

1520
01:43:21,242 --> 01:43:25,338
- Me too, Boris.
- I have to hand it to you,
this is not nose garbage.

1521
01:43:25,412 --> 01:43:27,744
It's quality stuff.

1522
01:43:27,815 --> 01:43:30,079
Perfect merchandise.

1523
01:43:30,150 --> 01:43:34,086
The only trouble is,
whenever I'm offered a deal
that's too good to be true,

1524
01:43:34,154 --> 01:43:37,646
it's because it's a lie.

1525

01:43:44,832 --> 01:43:47,596
- Why don't you convince me
you're on the level?
- Convince him.

1528
01:43:47,668 --> 01:43:49,932
If he don't bite,
we ain't got shit except possession.

1529
01:43:50,004 --> 01:43:53,599
Boris, we got all kinds of sandwich shit
back there. Make something for somebody.

1530
01:43:53,674 --> 01:43:55,699
We got lean pastrami, nice rye.
Anybody want anything?

- You got any aspirin?
- Yeah, sure. Get him that.

Well, uh, Lee,
it's like this.

1533
01:44:03,183 --> 01:44:07,119
You're getting the bargain of
a lifetime because I don't know
what the fuck I'm doing.

1534
01:44:07,187 --> 01:44:11,055
You're used to dealing with

I'm a rank amateur.

What the fuck's goin' on?

01:44:14,862 --> 01:44:19,629
I can take that and sell it a little bit
at a time. Make a lot more money.

- What's going on, Joe?
- Elliot's too far away.

- This is the whole ball game.
The game is set!
- He's too far away!

1539

I'm not saying you're a drug dealer.

Uh, Elliot wasn't supposed
to tell you anything.

He's not a dirty cop.
He's a good cop.

and he took it, that's all.
