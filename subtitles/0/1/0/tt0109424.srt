1
00:01:19,655 --> 00:01:22,576
Every day we brush past
so many other people.

2
00:01:23,136 --> 00:01:25,858
People we may never meet...

3
00:01:25,898 --> 00:01:30,018
or people who may become close friends.

4
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:34,941
I'm a cop, No. 223.
My name's He Qiwu.

5
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:45,465
Freeze!

6
00:02:12,196 --> 00:02:14,758
This was the closest we ever got.

7
00:02:14,838 --> 00:02:17,198
Just 0.01 of a centimetre between us.

8
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:20,801
But 57 hours later...

9
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,721
I fell in love with this woman.

10
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:26,882
Mrs. Chen? This is Qiwu.

11
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:30,404
Don't fetch May.
it's you I'm calling!

12
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,925
It's been a while. how are you?

13
00:02:34,605 --> 00:02:39,768
I'm okay.
Yes. Give May time to get over it.

14
00:02:39,847 --> 00:02:42,168
I'm sure she'll call me
when she's ready.

15
00:02:42,248 --> 00:02:46,450
Please don't tell her I called.

16
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:49,692
You're going to a movie?

17
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,892
I won't keep you.
Is Mr. Chen there?

18
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:58,215
Mr. Chen? This is Qiwu.

19
00:02:59,695 --> 00:03:04,778
No. don't call May!
How's your cough?

20
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:08,218
You're going to the movie
with your wife?

21
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:10,660
I won't keep you then.

22
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:12,661
Don't tell May I called!
Is her sister there?

23
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:15,982
No? Pass on my regards.

24
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:19,023
We all have our habits.

25
00:03:19,104 --> 00:03:21,505
Mine is to wait here for May after work.

26
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:25,947
The boss here says May looks like
a Japanese star.

27
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:27,907
She and I just split up.

28
00:03:27,987 --> 00:03:30,908
May wishes I were more like
a Japanese star myself.

29
00:03:30,988 --> 00:03:36,070
Message for account 368?

30
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:41,913
Call Ming? You mean May?

31
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:48,835
Spell it!
"M-I-N-G" or "M-A-Y"?

32
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:51,877
Sure there's no mistake?

33
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:54,838
Don't you know English?

34
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:03,561
Ming? I guess May asked you to call.

35
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:06,723
Tell her not to worry. I'm fine.

36
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:09,243
I'm taking good care of myself.

37
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:13,365
She can call me anytime she wants.

38
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:15,806
You don't need to mediate.

39
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:19,207
She didn't?

40
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:21,448
So why are you paging me?

41
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:22,770
Jogging?

42
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:24,690
Are you heartbroken again?

43
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:27,811
Then why go jogging?

44
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:31,053
A race? You're crazy!

45
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:34,014
Jogging is something private.
not something you do with an audience.

46
00:04:34,094 --> 00:04:35,654
Forget it!

47
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:41,097
We're all unlucky in love sometimes.

48
00:04:41,857 --> 00:04:44,618
When I am, I go jogging.

49
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,580
The body loses water when you jog...

50
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:50,420
so you have none left for tears.

51
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:53,021
Me, shed tears?

52
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:56,063
May always thought of me as "Mr. Cool. "

53
00:05:00,864 --> 00:05:02,786
Still no go with your girlfriend?

54
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:04,906
It's been a month!

55
00:05:04,946 --> 00:05:06,907
Get another!

56
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:09,508
How about May here?
She's not bad.

57
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:19,592
She's off early tonight.
Give it a go.

58
00:05:19,673 --> 00:05:21,514
She fancies you.

59
00:05:21,593 --> 00:05:24,754
Not tonight. I have a date.

60
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,602
A bigger one. but nothing fancy.

61
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:49,933
Give them some beers.

62
00:08:12,262 --> 00:08:13,463
How much?

63
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:17,585
When I spent the night with May...

64
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:20,425
so her parents wouldn't find out...

65
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:23,347
I'd climb down from the balcony.

66
00:08:25,308 --> 00:08:27,989
Will I ever get to do that again?

67
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,279
How much?

68
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,991
The date on the can tells me...

69
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:53,072
that I don't have much time left.

70
00:11:53,152 --> 00:11:55,313
If I don't find those Indians...

71
00:11:55,394 --> 00:11:57,234
I'll be in deep trouble.

72
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:19,123
Some how I've become very cautious.

73
00:12:19,203 --> 00:12:20,403
When I put on a raincoat...

74
00:12:20,483 --> 00:12:22,804
I put on sunglasses too.

75
00:12:22,884 --> 00:12:25,485
Who knows when it will rain...

76
00:12:25,564 --> 00:12:27,326
or when it will turn out sunny?

77
00:12:28,926 --> 00:12:30,767
Any messages for account 368?

78
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:32,047
Password, please.

79
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,408
"Undying Love"

80
00:12:33,488 --> 00:12:35,169
No messages?

81
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:37,050
Sorry, no.

82
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:39,811
Thanks anyway.

83
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:48,054
We split up on April Fool's Day.

84
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:57,898
Every day I buy a can of pineapple
with a sell-by date of May 1.

85
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:01,060
May loves pineapple...

86
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,301
and May 1 is my birthday.

87
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:08,903
If May hasn't changed her mind
by the time I've bought 30 cans...

88
00:13:09,863 --> 00:13:12,063
then our love will also expire.

89
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,987
Sir. this can's life will expire
tomorrow.

90
00:13:18,026 --> 00:13:20,067
I'll get you another one.

91
00:13:20,107 --> 00:13:21,427
No need.

92
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,911
The earliest flight tomorrow morning?

93
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:32,913
I want to make a reservation.

94
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:38,514
Just one.

95
00:13:59,843 --> 00:14:01,324
Have you seen these people?

96
00:14:01,364 --> 00:14:02,284
No.

97
00:14:02,964 --> 00:14:05,166
Look carefully.
they're with their kids.

98
00:14:05,206 --> 00:14:07,087
Can't help you.

99
00:14:49,024 --> 00:14:51,304
- You really don't know?
- I've no idea where he is.

100
00:14:51,383 --> 00:14:53,425
But he's a friend of yours!

101
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:54,746
No...

102
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,230
My daughter!

103
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,594
What do you want?

104
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:17,195
You have one hour to tell me.

105
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:20,716
Otherwise you'll never see
your daughter again.

106
00:15:34,802 --> 00:15:37,203
Please. an ice cream for her.

107
00:16:04,854 --> 00:16:07,856
Some men might sacrifice a kid
to save their own skin...

108
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:09,415
but he wasn't one of them.

109
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:10,976
One hour later, I set out.

110
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:19,820
Police! Freeze!

111
00:16:31,745 --> 00:16:33,466
It's six months since I nabbed anyone.

112
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,868
But I ran into this wanted man today.

113
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:39,788
Whenever I made an arrest...

114
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:42,870
I wanted May to be the first to know.

115
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:49,552
Hello? Hello?

116
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:28,368
Any canned pineapple
that expires on May 1 ?

117
00:17:28,408 --> 00:17:30,328
You know what day it is today?

118
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:31,409
April 30?

119
00:17:31,489 --> 00:17:32,530
Right!

120
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:35,372
You think we sell outdated stock?

121
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:37,691
There's still two hours to go.

122
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:41,533
Nobody would buy it!
Get a fresh one.

123
00:17:41,573 --> 00:17:46,575
People like you are hung up
on freshness.

124
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:49,656
You realize what goes into a can
of pineapple?

125
00:17:49,696 --> 00:17:51,818
The fruit must be grown. harvested.
sliced...

126
00:17:51,898 --> 00:17:53,259
and you just throw it away!

127
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,179
How do you think the can feels
about that?

128
00:17:55,258 --> 00:17:58,220
Buddy. I only work here.

129
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,661
Who cares about how the cans feel?
What about how I feel?

130
00:18:00,701 --> 00:18:04,023
Loading. more loading. unloading...

131
00:18:04,102 --> 00:18:06,103
How I wish cans wouldn't expire!

132
00:18:06,143 --> 00:18:08,104
It'd save me loads of work.

133
00:18:08,185 --> 00:18:11,305
You like expired cans?
Help yourself!.

134
00:18:11,386 --> 00:18:13,306
As many as you like!
On the house!

135
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:20,709
Somehow everything comes
with an expiry date.

136
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:23,231
Swordfish expires.

137
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,111
Meat sauce expires.

138
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:27,432
Even cling-film expires.

139
00:18:28,512 --> 00:18:33,155
Is there anything in the world
which doesn't?

140
00:18:37,236 --> 00:18:39,557
It's expired!
Don't want it!

141
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:44,599
You sure?

142
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:07,617
I finally found my 30th can.

143
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:13,099
As May 1 begins, realization dawns.

144
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,141
In May's eyes...

145
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,581
I'm no different
from a can of pineapple.

146
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,754
Come on. try it!

147
00:21:51,835 --> 00:21:54,356
Everyone says dogs are
a man's best friend.

148
00:21:55,436 --> 00:21:59,637
So how come mine won't share my grief?.

149
00:22:19,486 --> 00:22:22,248
This must be some kind of record.

150
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:25,288
I ate all 30 cans this evening.

151
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:31,090
Just as well May wasn't into garlic.

152
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,851
I'd just love to go out on the town now.

153
00:22:33,932 --> 00:22:36,613
May'll be in bed now.

154
00:22:36,653 --> 00:22:38,894
But what about that other May?

155
00:22:45,977 --> 00:22:47,817
Back again!

156
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,381
I'm thinking of going to a late show.

157
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:59,583
May's gone!

158
00:22:59,663 --> 00:23:01,063
Gone?

159
00:23:01,144 --> 00:23:04,704
You thought she'd wait around?
No way!

160
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:07,626
Waiting makes women nervous.

161
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:10,107
Drives them crazy.

162
00:23:10,187 --> 00:23:12,188
She went out with Richard.

163
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,749
Next time. get in quick.

164
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:17,430
I never dreamed...

165
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,311
two Mays could dump me in one night.

166
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:22,712
To get over it, I promise myself...

167
00:23:22,752 --> 00:23:24,152
never to go out with another girl
named May.

168
00:23:24,232 --> 00:23:28,034
Lulu? This is Qiwu.

169
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:30,075
Want to come out for a drink?

170
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:33,076
You're in bed already?

171
00:23:33,156 --> 00:23:35,037
This early?

172
00:23:36,157 --> 00:23:37,998
You were asleep?

173
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:40,919
Never mind. bye.

174
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,002
Chieko-san? Guess who?
This is Qiwu!

175
00:23:48,642 --> 00:23:50,804
That's right!

176
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:53,804
Want to come out for a drink?

177
00:23:54,885 --> 00:23:59,326
Your husband?
When did you get married?

178
00:23:59,406 --> 00:24:01,207
Five years!

179
00:24:01,247 --> 00:24:04,049
Has it been that long?

180
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:06,410
You have two kids!

181
00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:09,890
You're happy. that's great!

182
00:24:09,971 --> 00:24:14,293
Okay. never mind.

183
00:24:19,215 --> 00:24:21,376
Is Kong Siu-Wai there?

184
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:24,257
This is He Qiwu.

185
00:24:25,617 --> 00:24:30,299
We were classmates in grade four.

186
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,862
You don't remember?

187
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,782
Nothing. good-bye.

188
00:25:09,956 --> 00:25:13,196
All those pineapples gave me
a stomach-ache.

189
00:25:14,036 --> 00:25:16,199
So I went to a bar.

190
00:25:16,238 --> 00:25:18,518
I thought alcohol would settle
my stomach.

191
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:44,929
Are you okay?

192
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:48,171
Yes... another double.

193
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:57,255
There's a song "Love Dies at Dawn. "

194
00:25:58,214 --> 00:26:00,535
That's how I feel now.

195
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:02,856
How can I forget May?

196
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:06,338
I promise myself...

197
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:08,099
I'll fall in love...

198
00:26:08,178 --> 00:26:10,019
with the first woman who walks in here.

199
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:14,062
What can I get you. Miss?

200
00:26:14,102 --> 00:26:15,541
Whiskey. please.

201
00:26:26,906 --> 00:26:29,268
I have a feeling she'll like me.

202
00:26:29,308 --> 00:26:32,189
And I know the perfect icebreaker.

203
00:26:43,193 --> 00:26:45,954
Excuse me. Miss. do you like pineapple?

204
00:26:48,035 --> 00:26:50,036
Maybe she's not Cantonese.

205
00:26:51,516 --> 00:26:54,598
Excuse me. Miss. do you like pineapple?

206
00:27:07,643 --> 00:27:10,124
May I ask you if you like pineapple?

207
00:27:11,164 --> 00:27:13,165
You speak good Mandarin.

208
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:15,086
I grew up in Taiwan. and you?

209
00:27:16,246 --> 00:27:18,208
I'm not in the mood to talk.

210
00:27:18,287 --> 00:27:20,448
Leave me alone.

211
00:27:21,448 --> 00:27:23,329
We don't have to talk.

212
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:25,851
Can I just sit here?

213
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:29,132
Plenty of seats. why sit here?

214
00:27:30,212 --> 00:27:32,933
I can feel that you're lonely.

215
00:27:33,012 --> 00:27:34,134
Really?

216
00:27:34,214 --> 00:27:35,894
Yes.

217
00:27:35,975 --> 00:27:39,896
Why would a woman be wearing shades
this late?

218
00:27:39,976 --> 00:27:43,418
Either she's blind...

219
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:46,779
or she's a poseur...

220
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:51,741
or she doesn't want people to see
she's been crying.

221
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,382
So which reason applies?

222
00:27:55,462 --> 00:27:57,222
The last one!

223
00:27:58,784 --> 00:28:02,545
It's okay. No need to cry.

224
00:28:03,385 --> 00:28:04,986
I've fallen out of love too.

225
00:28:05,065 --> 00:28:10,228
I usually go jogging to get sweaty...

226
00:28:10,308 --> 00:28:12,709
so that I have no more water for tears.

227
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:13,990
Wanna go jogging?

228
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:16,631
I've been racing around all evening.
I'm tired.

229
00:28:18,032 --> 00:28:20,832
If you want to talk...

230
00:28:20,913 --> 00:28:23,194
find someone else.

231
00:28:24,194 --> 00:28:26,634
I don't particularly want to talk.

232
00:28:26,715 --> 00:28:28,915
I just want to keep you company.

233
00:28:30,717 --> 00:28:33,038
I know how it feels
to be broken hearted.

234
00:28:33,118 --> 00:28:37,279
A woman needs a boyfriend to lean on.

235
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:43,802
I don't have a boyfriend.

236
00:28:43,882 --> 00:28:46,124
And I don't have a girlfriend.

237
00:28:47,324 --> 00:28:49,325
How old are you?

238
00:28:50,965 --> 00:28:53,085
Two hours ago. I was still 24.

239
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:54,567
Now I'm 25.

240
00:28:56,408 --> 00:28:58,248
I won't like you.

241
00:28:59,168 --> 00:29:01,328
Don't be so sure.

242
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:05,250
We might hit it off!.

243
00:29:05,331 --> 00:29:07,851
Do you like pineapple?

244
00:29:08,691 --> 00:29:11,094
None of your business.

245
00:29:11,174 --> 00:29:13,614
I'm just trying to learn more about you.

246
00:29:15,095 --> 00:29:18,576
I was in love
with a girl for five years.

247
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:22,498
We've just split up.

248
00:29:22,577 --> 00:29:25,339
She says I don't understand her.

249
00:29:25,378 --> 00:29:27,540
So I want to find out more about you.

250
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:31,701
You'll find out nothing.

251
00:29:32,982 --> 00:29:34,984
Just give me a chance to!

252
00:29:35,063 --> 00:29:37,023
Okay. find out more about me.

253
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:39,225
What kind of man do you like?

254
00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:48,228
Knowing someone doesn't mean
keeping them.

255
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:50,348
People change.

256
00:29:50,428 --> 00:29:52,310
A person may like pineapple today...

257
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,591
and something else tomorrow.

258
00:30:52,494 --> 00:30:55,456
Sir! Sir!

259
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:57,336
We're closing.

260
00:31:01,738 --> 00:31:03,820
Closing?

261
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,860
Wanna jog?

262
00:31:08,781 --> 00:31:11,463
I just want a place to rest.

263
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,843
When she said "rest", she meant it.

264
00:32:03,243 --> 00:32:06,964
I watched two old movies
on TV that night...

265
00:32:07,004 --> 00:32:08,885
and had four chef's salads.

266
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:26,636
When the sun rose, I knew I had to go.

267
00:33:28,237 --> 00:33:31,599
But I took her shoes off before I left.

268
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:36,680
My mother says
a woman's feet swell up...

269
00:33:36,761 --> 00:33:39,362
if she sleeps in high heels.

270
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:53,928
She must have walked a lot that night.

271
00:33:54,008 --> 00:33:58,089
Such a pretty woman should have
clean shoes.

272
00:35:05,956 --> 00:35:09,078
I was actually born at 6:00 a.m.

273
00:35:09,118 --> 00:35:11,799
So I'll really be 25
two minutes from now.

274
00:35:12,999 --> 00:35:17,281
A quarter of a century!

275
00:35:19,163 --> 00:35:22,003
To celebrate this historic moment,
I'm jogging.

276
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:28,045
Getting rid of my body's excess water.

277
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:31,688
It feels pretty good.

278
00:35:31,767 --> 00:35:36,249
Leaving the sports ground,
I decide to ditch my pager.

279
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:40,291
After all, no one's gonna call me.

280
00:36:30,392 --> 00:36:31,792
Account 368.

281
00:36:31,871 --> 00:36:34,353
Password, please.

282
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,273
"Undying Love"

283
00:36:35,313 --> 00:36:38,355
Your friend in room 702 says,
"Happy Birthday".

284
00:36:40,876 --> 00:36:41,956
Thank you.

285
00:36:43,157 --> 00:36:45,998
On May 1, 1994...

286
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:49,119
a woman wishes me a happy birthday.

287
00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:53,720
Now I'll remember her all my life.

288
00:36:55,201 --> 00:36:57,602
If memories could be canned...

289
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,164
would they also have expiry dates?

290
00:37:01,284 --> 00:37:05,285
If so, I hope they last for centuries.

291
00:39:08,455 --> 00:39:10,177
Coke. please.

292
00:39:10,216 --> 00:39:12,497
Jogging again?

293
00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:21,221
Save your energy!

294
00:39:22,221 --> 00:39:25,783
Hey. try Faye!
She's not bad either.

295
00:39:25,862 --> 00:39:27,623
Who's Faye?

296
00:39:27,703 --> 00:39:30,064
She started here today.

297
00:39:30,144 --> 00:39:33,986
Get in quick!
Beat Richard to it!

298
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:42,589
-Thanks. but I don't go for boys.
-Boys?

299
00:39:42,669 --> 00:39:44,230
Excuse me!

300
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,270
This was the closest we ever got.

301
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,593
Just 0.01 of a centimetre between us.

302
00:39:49,672 --> 00:39:52,033
I knew nothing about her.

303
00:39:52,073 --> 00:39:53,193
But six hours later...

304
00:39:53,274 --> 00:39:55,634
she fell in love with another man.

305
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,283
Chef's salad. please.

306
00:40:15,643 --> 00:40:17,404
Take out?

307
00:40:22,446 --> 00:40:24,207
New here?

308
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,929
You like noisy music?

309
00:40:32,569 --> 00:40:35,170
Yes. the louder the better.

310
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,413
Stops me from thinking.

311
00:40:40,493 --> 00:40:42,773
You don't like to think?

312
00:40:45,334 --> 00:40:47,696
What do you like?

313
00:40:48,816 --> 00:40:51,057
Never thought about it.
I'll tell you when I know myself.

314
00:40:51,137 --> 00:40:53,458
How about you?
What do you like?

315
00:40:56,379 --> 00:40:57,700
A chef's salad.

316
00:41:54,403 --> 00:41:55,803
One chef's salad. please.

317
00:41:56,484 --> 00:41:57,923
Chef's salad again?

318
00:41:57,963 --> 00:42:00,005
Aren't you tired of it?

319
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:01,446
It's not for me.

320
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:02,806
Girlfriend?

321
00:42:03,966 --> 00:42:05,967
It's her favourite?

322
00:42:07,209 --> 00:42:09,529
I dunno. she never said it wasn't.

323
00:42:09,609 --> 00:42:12,770
Maybe she'd like something different
for once?

324
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:16,091
Try fish and chips.
That's good.

325
00:42:16,132 --> 00:42:18,372
What if she doesn't like it?

326
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:20,253
Get both and let her choose.

327
00:42:20,293 --> 00:42:23,895
You can't go wrong.

328
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:25,215
Won't that be a waste?

329
00:42:25,255 --> 00:42:27,536
Doesn't cost much.

330
00:42:27,616 --> 00:42:29,537
Come on. give her a choice!

331
00:42:31,138 --> 00:42:33,619
Okay. one chef's salad.
one fish and chips.

332
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,741
Coming up!

333
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:25,039
Fish and chips. please.

334
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,881
See. I told you she'd like it.

335
00:43:28,962 --> 00:43:33,282
She should have said
she didn't like chef's salad.

336
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:42,406
You never gave her any choice!

337
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:45,328
If you had. she might have said.

338
00:43:46,569 --> 00:43:47,768
Speaking of choice...

339
00:43:47,849 --> 00:43:49,690
try pizza tonight.

340
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:53,331
Dunno if she'll like that.

341
00:43:53,372 --> 00:43:58,613
Then do the same trick:
get both.

342
00:43:58,693 --> 00:44:01,134
Won't break the bank.

343
00:44:02,494 --> 00:44:03,775
Okay!

344
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:13,179
Want to try something different again?

345
00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:15,780
The hot dog is good.

346
00:44:15,859 --> 00:44:17,621
No thanks. just a black coffee.

347
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:20,302
Nothing for your girlfriend?

348
00:44:21,342 --> 00:44:22,583
She's gone.

349
00:44:22,623 --> 00:44:23,983
Why?

350
00:44:24,062 --> 00:44:26,025
To try something else. she said.

351
00:44:27,105 --> 00:44:28,665
I guess she's right.

352
00:44:28,745 --> 00:44:31,987
Plenty of choice in men.
just like food.

353
00:44:34,388 --> 00:44:38,069
I guess I should've stuck
with the chef's salad.

354
00:44:39,709 --> 00:44:41,871
Never mind!

355
00:44:41,951 --> 00:44:44,752
She'll try someone else and find out
you're better.

356
00:44:44,831 --> 00:44:48,674
And she'll come running back.

357
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:50,234
Thanks.

358
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:13,564
Onboard every flight...

359
00:45:13,604 --> 00:45:15,484
there's one stewardess
you long to seduce.

360
00:45:16,485 --> 00:45:18,965
This time last year, at 25,000 feet...

361
00:45:19,046 --> 00:45:21,487
I actually seduced one.

362
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:30,139
I thought we'd stay together
for the long haul.

363
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:33,140
Flying like a jumbo jet on a full tank.

364
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,861
But we changed course.

365
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,840
Black coffee. please.

366
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,361
A week and she's not back?

367
00:48:25,441 --> 00:48:26,883
Excuse me!

368
00:48:29,803 --> 00:48:32,404
Maybe she does have plenty of choices.

369
00:48:32,484 --> 00:48:37,647
Then get her out of your mind!

370
00:48:37,727 --> 00:48:39,647
You can't go on drinking black coffee
like that.

371
00:48:40,687 --> 00:48:42,408
Takes time to change.

372
00:48:42,448 --> 00:48:43,729
I'll take things easy.

373
00:48:45,449 --> 00:48:47,450
I'll be okay.

374
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:50,571
If you say so.

375
00:49:25,746 --> 00:49:26,746
Excuse me.

376
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:22,512
The policeman who buys
a chef's salad here every night...

377
00:49:30,188 --> 00:49:35,190
Oh. you mean No. 633.
He's off duty today.

378
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:37,551
Isn't he off on Saturdays?

379
00:49:37,591 --> 00:49:40,392
He changed shifts.
Didn't he tell you?

380
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:55,637
Can you give him this
when he next comes?

381
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,519
No problem.

382
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,759
Thank you.

383
00:51:26,955 --> 00:51:29,476
- I'll be back soon.
- What?

384
00:51:29,516 --> 00:51:31,236
I'll be right back!

385
00:51:31,317 --> 00:51:32,397
Oh.

386
00:51:40,761 --> 00:51:41,761
Where to?

387
00:51:41,842 --> 00:51:43,361
I have to go out too.

388
00:52:15,015 --> 00:52:17,695
Just you here tonight?

389
00:52:19,576 --> 00:52:22,298
Just you here tonight?

390
00:52:23,218 --> 00:52:25,019
They were all here just now.

391
00:52:26,499 --> 00:52:28,900
Rushed off as you came up.

392
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:32,981
What's wrong with me?

393
00:52:33,062 --> 00:52:34,182
Nothing.

394
00:52:35,143 --> 00:52:36,583
Black coffee?

395
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,946
Last night...

396
00:52:46,228 --> 00:52:47,348
a girl...

397
00:52:49,588 --> 00:52:51,909
Last night a girl--

398
00:52:51,989 --> 00:52:54,591
Can you turn it down a bit?

399
00:53:04,755 --> 00:53:09,516
A girl waited for you here
last night.

400
00:53:10,717 --> 00:53:12,918
She left a letter for you.

401
00:53:14,158 --> 00:53:16,118
Really?

402
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:18,601
Yes. an air hostess.

403
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,122
- Don't you want to read it?
- After my coffee.

404
00:53:58,415 --> 00:54:01,058
Hey. your letter!

405
00:54:01,098 --> 00:54:03,459
Keep it for me. Next time.

406
00:54:25,147 --> 00:54:26,507
Boss.

407
00:54:26,588 --> 00:54:28,268
What are you doing here?

408
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:29,348
I'm on duty.

409
00:54:29,428 --> 00:54:30,349
Where's No. 633?

410
00:54:30,389 --> 00:54:33,231
- Annual leave.
- Really?

411
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:37,551
Said he was wounded by a pin.
He's convalescing at home.

412
00:54:37,632 --> 00:54:39,994
Wounded by a pin?

413
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:47,317
Since she left,
everything in the flat is sad.

414
00:54:47,357 --> 00:54:49,557
Everything needed
lulling to sleep.

415
00:54:50,518 --> 00:54:53,278
You've lost a lot of weight.
you know.

416
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:57,280
You used to be so chubby.

417
00:55:01,121 --> 00:55:04,563
Have more confidence
in yourself.

418
00:55:09,925 --> 00:55:14,567
You have to stop crying.
you know.

419
00:55:14,648 --> 00:55:17,248
Where's your strength
and absorbency?

420
00:55:17,328 --> 00:55:20,570
You're so shabby these days.
Look at you.

421
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:24,211
I'll help you.

422
00:55:34,735 --> 00:55:36,016
Isn't that better?

423
00:55:36,817 --> 00:55:39,017
Say something.

424
00:55:40,138 --> 00:55:41,898
Don't blame her.

425
00:55:43,178 --> 00:55:45,740
We all have moments of doubt.

426
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,861
Give her a chance. okay?

427
00:55:52,863 --> 00:55:53,743
Lonely?

428
00:55:55,184 --> 00:55:58,985
You look a real mess.

429
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:02,067
Cold? I'll warm you up.

430
00:56:06,588 --> 00:56:07,990
Boss!

431
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:10,390
- Had your lunch?
- Yup!

432
00:56:10,430 --> 00:56:13,351
It's all ready for you.
Need any help?

433
00:56:13,431 --> 00:56:15,872
It's okay. I'll manage.

434
00:56:18,113 --> 00:56:19,153
Excuse me.

435
00:56:24,596 --> 00:56:28,157
Hey. what are you doing here?

436
00:56:28,198 --> 00:56:30,358
- Are you better?
- Better?

437
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:35,480
They said you were
wounded by a pin.

438
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:38,321
Nonsense.

439
00:56:39,802 --> 00:56:42,684
Haven't seen you around lately.

440
00:56:42,763 --> 00:56:45,724
I changed shifts.
I'm on this beat now.

441
00:56:45,805 --> 00:56:47,044
Really?

442
00:56:47,084 --> 00:56:49,246
- Need some help?
- Yes. please.

443
00:56:52,967 --> 00:56:54,208
I'll be going.

444
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:00,811
This is heavy.

445
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:03,371
It's worse some days.

446
00:57:03,451 --> 00:57:05,893
Must be hard for you.

447
00:57:05,972 --> 00:57:09,093
That's work for you.

448
00:57:09,173 --> 00:57:12,014
Why'd you take this job?

449
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:14,296
The boss is my cousin.

450
00:57:14,376 --> 00:57:17,457
He asked me to help out.

451
00:57:17,537 --> 00:57:19,897
What did you do before?

452
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,459
Lots of things.

453
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,660
I'm saving up.

454
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:26,700
To study?

455
00:57:26,781 --> 00:57:28,781
Never thought of that.

456
00:57:28,861 --> 00:57:30,783
I just want to enjoy life.

457
00:57:31,343 --> 00:57:32,783
How? Where?

458
00:57:32,864 --> 00:57:34,744
Anywhere.

459
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,144
Maybe California.

460
00:57:37,826 --> 00:57:39,987
California? Why?

461
00:57:41,787 --> 00:57:45,709
I said maybe. I can move on
if it's no fun.

462
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,630
You like to travel?

463
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:51,271
Don't you?

464
00:57:51,351 --> 00:57:54,312
I'm happy staying in one place.

465
00:57:57,153 --> 00:58:00,955
You can come with me.
I almost have enough.

466
00:58:02,356 --> 00:58:03,996
We'll see.

467
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:08,677
Are you always like this?

468
00:58:08,757 --> 00:58:11,559
I still have that letter.

469
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,960
Haven't had time to pick it up.

470
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:18,002
Give me your address.
I'll mail it.

471
00:58:18,082 --> 00:58:19,762
Or it'll get lost.

472
00:58:20,843 --> 00:58:21,763
Okay.

473
00:58:47,653 --> 00:58:49,694
You live near here!

474
00:58:49,775 --> 00:58:54,456
Yeah. drop in on me sometime.

475
00:58:54,537 --> 00:58:56,297
Sure.

476
00:58:58,338 --> 00:58:59,579
Well. let's move.

477
00:59:00,259 --> 00:59:03,660
You're sweating. Are you okay?

478
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,502
I'm okay.

479
00:59:58,002 --> 01:00:01,203
Stop daydreaming. will you?

480
01:00:01,243 --> 01:00:03,445
You want to be a star?

481
01:00:03,525 --> 01:00:07,326
And leave the carrots alone!

482
01:00:08,246 --> 01:00:09,606
Who's going to eat that now?

483
01:00:09,687 --> 01:00:11,848
Use a toilet roll or something!

484
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:20,572
And you.

485
01:00:20,651 --> 01:00:22,412
I'm not daydreaming.

486
01:00:22,492 --> 01:00:24,013
Right. you're not daydreaming.

487
01:00:24,092 --> 01:00:25,853
You're sleepwalking!

488
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,935
Sure. sleepwalking.

489
01:00:32,336 --> 01:00:33,696
Whatever you say.

490
01:00:38,258 --> 01:00:40,460
I had a dream that afternoon.

491
01:00:40,539 --> 01:00:42,660
It seemed I was
in his apartment.

492
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:46,062
And I'd wake up
only when I left it.

493
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:49,022
I didn't know you never wake up
from some dreams.

494
01:00:57,066 --> 01:00:59,388
Some days I go home for lunch.

495
01:00:59,468 --> 01:01:01,828
There's always the chance
she'll be back.

496
01:01:04,229 --> 01:01:07,351
I know you're in there.

497
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:09,311
Come on out.

498
01:01:10,272 --> 01:01:12,952
I'll count to three.

499
01:01:13,033 --> 01:01:14,953
One...

500
01:01:15,033 --> 01:01:17,515
two. three!

501
01:01:17,595 --> 01:01:20,916
She used to leap out
of the closet to scare me.

502
01:01:20,956 --> 01:01:23,436
But she's stopped doing it.

503
01:01:23,518 --> 01:01:26,198
I guess the game palled
after a while.

504
01:01:35,242 --> 01:01:37,402
Can she be hiding
in the toilet?

505
01:02:35,225 --> 01:02:36,467
Hello.

506
01:02:39,028 --> 01:02:39,948
Hello!

507
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:00,196
Charsiu with rice.

508
01:03:03,317 --> 01:03:05,838
Excuse me.

509
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,361
- It's you again!
- Yes.

510
01:03:14,562 --> 01:03:16,523
Will you be here
for a while?

511
01:03:17,964 --> 01:03:19,484
Why?

512
01:03:19,564 --> 01:03:21,444
Nothing.

513
01:03:25,567 --> 01:03:27,367
Where are you going?

514
01:03:27,407 --> 01:03:29,648
I forgot something.

515
01:03:30,729 --> 01:03:34,050
Oh. I still haven't
mailed your letter.

516
01:03:34,131 --> 01:03:35,771
No hurry.

517
01:03:35,851 --> 01:03:38,652
I'll get around to it.

518
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:46,895
Why are you back?

519
01:03:46,975 --> 01:03:49,776
I have to pay the electricity bill.
Can I leave this here?

520
01:03:54,898 --> 01:03:59,180
Cousin?
I'm still at the market.

521
01:04:00,981 --> 01:04:03,421
What? Why?
It's pouring with rain.

522
01:04:05,463 --> 01:04:07,544
Can you hear?

523
01:04:07,584 --> 01:04:10,945
What are you talking about?
It's sunny!

524
01:04:11,025 --> 01:04:14,627
Really? Must be a local shower.

525
01:04:14,707 --> 01:04:16,547
I'll be back when it stops.

526
01:04:16,627 --> 01:04:18,147
Don't forget
the electricity bill.

527
01:04:18,228 --> 01:04:19,549
I won't.

528
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:02,790
I'm leaving now.

529
01:06:02,831 --> 01:06:05,991
Okay. I'll see you again soon.

530
01:06:06,031 --> 01:06:07,432
I will.

531
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:32,082
Got this for you.

532
01:06:35,003 --> 01:06:36,884
Why so many lychees?

533
01:06:36,923 --> 01:06:38,604
They're for a friend.

534
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:45,688
Where are you?

535
01:06:45,767 --> 01:06:47,889
Paying the electricity bill.

536
01:06:47,929 --> 01:06:49,769
You've been gone for hours!

537
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:53,051
It's packed here.
I can hardly get in the shop.

538
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:54,731
I'll just have to queue.

539
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:58,533
How come it's always so crowded?

540
01:07:00,773 --> 01:07:03,575
Search me.

541
01:07:03,615 --> 01:07:08,537
Shall I try again tomorrow?

542
01:07:08,577 --> 01:07:11,379
Try another shop.

543
01:07:11,459 --> 01:07:14,580
Another shop?

544
01:07:14,659 --> 01:07:17,620
Okay. I'll try. I'll try.

545
01:07:22,463 --> 01:07:24,583
Been shopping?

546
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:27,184
A friend is
redecorating his place.

547
01:07:27,264 --> 01:07:29,586
- You sure are busy.
- I certainly am.

548
01:07:31,746 --> 01:07:35,589
Black coffee again.
It's bad for you.

549
01:07:35,629 --> 01:07:37,829
If you can't sleep, drink water.

550
01:10:51,628 --> 01:10:53,508
Hi. it's me.

551
01:10:53,588 --> 01:10:55,549
The plane has returned
to Hong Kong.

552
01:10:55,629 --> 01:10:57,429
You want to make a booking?

553
01:10:57,469 --> 01:11:00,031
Call me. Same number.

554
01:11:48,451 --> 01:11:50,611
Wow.

555
01:11:50,692 --> 01:11:53,972
How long did it take
to grow it like this?

556
01:11:54,012 --> 01:11:55,893
None of your business.

557
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:01,095
A bit flirty. isn't she?

558
01:12:01,176 --> 01:12:02,056
Guess so.

559
01:12:06,417 --> 01:12:08,378
Why?

560
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:09,459
Well.

561
01:12:09,498 --> 01:12:10,900
Do you know her well?

562
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:11,860
Nope.

563
01:12:19,904 --> 01:12:24,425
One day I had this
sudden feeling she was back.

564
01:12:55,157 --> 01:12:57,399
Did I leave the tap running...

565
01:12:57,478 --> 01:13:00,240
or is the apartment
getting more tearful?

566
01:13:00,279 --> 01:13:02,600
I always thought
it would cope okay.

567
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,362
Didn't expect it to cry so much.

568
01:13:05,401 --> 01:13:06,442
When people cry...

569
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:08,923
they can dry their eyes
with tissues.

570
01:13:09,004 --> 01:13:10,444
But when an apartment cries...

571
01:13:10,523 --> 01:13:12,804
it takes a lot to mop it up.

572
01:13:32,373 --> 01:13:34,774
What are you doing here?

573
01:13:34,854 --> 01:13:36,134
I live here.

574
01:13:36,214 --> 01:13:37,135
You live here?

575
01:13:37,214 --> 01:13:39,095
Why are you here?

576
01:13:39,135 --> 01:13:42,016
Buying goldfish.

577
01:13:42,097 --> 01:13:44,577
- No one here sells goldfish.
- No?

578
01:13:44,657 --> 01:13:46,338
- You came to buy goldfish?
- Yes.

579
01:13:46,378 --> 01:13:47,860
Buy them or sell them?

580
01:13:47,939 --> 01:13:51,060
What do you mean?

581
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:55,061
Stop it! I forget everything
when I'm scared.

582
01:13:55,141 --> 01:13:56,343
Why are you scared?

583
01:13:56,423 --> 01:13:59,704
I don't know! You scare me.

584
01:13:59,784 --> 01:14:01,144
I'm going now.

585
01:14:05,666 --> 01:14:08,987
Are you stuck?

586
01:14:09,067 --> 01:14:13,110
Don't push me.
I'd go if I could.

587
01:14:13,189 --> 01:14:14,590
You have a cramp?

588
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:17,711
I don't know.
It's never happened before.

589
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:19,151
You'd better come in.

590
01:14:29,556 --> 01:14:33,598
When she'd return from a long
flight I'd massage her legs.

591
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:36,279
Being a stewardess
is tough on the legs.

592
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:39,000
I've always found
women's legs sexy.

593
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:42,521
Haven't touched any
since she left.

594
01:14:49,764 --> 01:14:51,004
Is that better?

595
01:14:51,044 --> 01:14:52,645
Yes. Can I go now?

596
01:14:52,725 --> 01:14:55,206
Stay a bit longer.

597
01:14:55,286 --> 01:14:56,847
I'll put on some music.

598
01:15:18,696 --> 01:15:20,617
You like this song too?

599
01:15:20,697 --> 01:15:22,017
I'm not really into music.

600
01:15:22,057 --> 01:15:24,137
My ex-girlfriend chose this.

601
01:15:27,259 --> 01:15:30,540
She liked this song?

602
01:15:30,621 --> 01:15:31,501
Yes.

603
01:15:39,944 --> 01:15:43,226
Sure, his girlfriend liked it.

604
01:15:43,306 --> 01:15:47,147
That's my CD.
I left it here a few days ago.

605
01:15:47,187 --> 01:15:51,669
Can dreams be catching?

606
01:15:51,749 --> 01:15:53,310
I guess I've been too nervous.

607
01:15:53,389 --> 01:15:55,190
After a while, I fall asleep.

608
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:21,761
The girl fell asleep
in my place that afternoon.

609
01:16:21,842 --> 01:16:24,003
I thought about waking her up...

610
01:16:24,082 --> 01:16:26,083
but for some reason I didn't.

611
01:16:57,775 --> 01:16:58,696
Shit!

612
01:17:02,738 --> 01:17:04,618
Don't set fire to anything.

613
01:17:05,619 --> 01:17:07,540
Watch those candles.

614
01:17:13,063 --> 01:17:15,223
This is your fault.
What's gotten into you lately?

615
01:17:15,303 --> 01:17:18,625
Why didn't you pay
the electricity bill?

616
01:17:18,705 --> 01:17:21,986
Where have you been
getting to every day?

617
01:17:22,066 --> 01:17:24,026
I went to see the doctor.

618
01:17:24,107 --> 01:17:27,269
Really? You haven't been
taking medicine.

619
01:17:27,348 --> 01:17:30,109
Of course I have.
You just didn't notice.

620
01:17:30,189 --> 01:17:34,271
And did the doctor tell you
when you'd get better?

621
01:17:34,352 --> 01:17:37,192
Anytime now.

622
01:17:42,515 --> 01:17:43,395
Crazy!

623
01:17:56,319 --> 01:17:59,081
I don' know
if it's the weather...

624
01:17:59,121 --> 01:18:01,402
but lately I've changed a lot.

625
01:18:01,482 --> 01:18:03,642
I've become more observant.

626
01:18:03,722 --> 01:18:06,003
I notice things
I used to take for granted.

627
01:18:10,005 --> 01:18:12,246
Even the sardines
taste different.

628
01:19:04,667 --> 01:19:07,949
You mustn't let yourself go.

629
01:19:08,028 --> 01:19:12,551
You've gained weight so fast.

630
01:19:14,631 --> 01:19:19,554
She may have gone
but life goes on.

631
01:19:19,594 --> 01:19:22,475
You must stop
indulging yourself.

632
01:19:22,514 --> 01:19:25,435
You're a real
disappointment to me.

633
01:19:25,516 --> 01:19:27,997
You've changed so much.

634
01:19:28,077 --> 01:19:30,798
You can't just
switch personality like this.

635
01:19:30,838 --> 01:19:33,799
Her walking out is no excuse.

636
01:19:36,281 --> 01:19:37,841
Pull yourself together.

637
01:19:44,044 --> 01:19:46,444
It was such a relief
when I saw it crying.

638
01:19:46,485 --> 01:19:49,285
It may look different...

639
01:19:49,365 --> 01:19:52,127
but it's still true to itself.

640
01:19:52,207 --> 01:19:54,448
It's still
an emotionally charged towel.

641
01:19:54,488 --> 01:19:57,369
I'm more optimistic these days.
Haven't you noticed?

642
01:19:57,448 --> 01:20:00,411
Things are starting to look up.

643
01:20:00,491 --> 01:20:03,332
You used to look really dumb...

644
01:20:03,411 --> 01:20:06,453
but you've become quite cute.

645
01:20:06,492 --> 01:20:10,655
But you mustn't
get yourself so dirty.

646
01:20:12,255 --> 01:20:14,656
You used to be cleaner.

647
01:20:14,696 --> 01:20:17,417
Look at these dirty stripes.

648
01:20:20,097 --> 01:20:22,458
Have you been fighting?

649
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:32,143
Oh. that's where
you've been hiding.

650
01:20:34,184 --> 01:20:38,665
Time to stop running away.

651
01:20:41,947 --> 01:20:44,948
You don't smell too good.
either.

652
01:20:45,028 --> 01:20:49,551
Out in the sun tomorrow. okay?

653
01:21:35,168 --> 01:21:36,649
What are you doing
in my apartment?

654
01:21:36,728 --> 01:21:38,930
You asked me to visit.

655
01:21:41,251 --> 01:21:44,812
Come on. open up!

656
01:22:14,705 --> 01:22:17,185
Someone's looking for you.

657
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:19,427
- Me?
- Yes.

658
01:22:24,228 --> 01:22:25,510
What do you want?

659
01:22:25,589 --> 01:22:26,630
I've come for my letter.

660
01:22:27,630 --> 01:22:29,711
What letter? Ask the boss.

661
01:22:30,551 --> 01:22:33,072
You were keeping it.

662
01:22:33,152 --> 01:22:34,953
He says you have it.

663
01:22:35,033 --> 01:22:36,234
Me? Where?

664
01:22:39,874 --> 01:22:40,795
Oh. yes.

665
01:22:45,277 --> 01:22:48,398
I was afraid it would get lost.
I promise I haven't read it.

666
01:22:53,041 --> 01:22:53,920
Thanks.

667
01:22:56,321 --> 01:22:58,002
Are you free tomorrow evening?

668
01:22:58,923 --> 01:23:00,203
Why do you ask?

669
01:23:00,283 --> 01:23:01,524
I want to date you.

670
01:23:01,603 --> 01:23:03,164
A date?

671
01:23:03,204 --> 01:23:04,605
The boss says
you're off tomorrow.

672
01:23:06,766 --> 01:23:09,526
So I have to go on a date?

673
01:23:09,607 --> 01:23:11,448
Think it over.

674
01:23:11,527 --> 01:23:14,369
I'll meet you in
California Restaurant at 8:00.

675
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:21,491
That song's not right for you.
Try this one.

676
01:23:35,137 --> 01:23:39,339
I'm doomed! Doomed!

677
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,542
Hey. No. 633
is good with girls.

678
01:23:46,622 --> 01:23:47,983
Boss. he's No. 633.

679
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,463
Who cares?

680
01:24:09,831 --> 01:24:11,232
Boy. I'm out of cups.

681
01:24:20,235 --> 01:24:23,076
I cleaned up my place
that afternoon.

682
01:24:23,116 --> 01:24:25,997
It was like cleaning
the runway for a new flight.

683
01:25:04,373 --> 01:25:06,854
I got to the restaurant
a little early.

684
01:25:06,934 --> 01:25:08,975
I half expected a flight delay.

685
01:25:09,015 --> 01:25:10,496
So I got some loose change.

686
01:25:24,061 --> 01:25:25,342
Coins. please.

687
01:25:42,309 --> 01:25:46,590
Half an hour later,
Ibrokeanother$10note.

688
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:48,312
Had the flight been cancelled?

689
01:26:12,881 --> 01:26:14,762
She isn't coming.

690
01:26:14,802 --> 01:26:17,203
She asked me to give you this.

691
01:26:19,564 --> 01:26:21,965
Don't let it get you down.
though.

692
01:26:22,045 --> 01:26:24,806
Try another girl.

693
01:26:24,886 --> 01:26:29,408
May's nice.
She's coming back tomorrow.

694
01:26:29,488 --> 01:26:30,609
Where is she?

695
01:26:30,649 --> 01:26:35,410
She quit. Said she was
going to California.

696
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:37,251
Nothing else.

697
01:26:37,331 --> 01:26:38,332
Thanks.

698
01:26:42,173 --> 01:26:43,734
I didn't open the letter.

699
01:26:45,095 --> 01:26:48,055
Some things need time
to sink in.

700
01:26:48,095 --> 01:26:50,656
Once the snack bar manager
had gone...

701
01:26:50,736 --> 01:26:53,538
I started talking
to the beer bottles.

702
01:26:53,578 --> 01:26:55,738
Disappointed?

703
01:26:55,778 --> 01:26:57,859
Not really.

704
01:26:57,939 --> 01:27:01,701
Go home and sleep.
She's not coming.

705
01:27:12,666 --> 01:27:14,546
Actually, she did go
to California that evening.

706
01:27:14,626 --> 01:27:17,188
But it was the other one.

707
01:27:17,228 --> 01:27:19,908
We were in
different Californias...

708
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:21,949
with a 15-hour time difference
between us.

709
01:27:23,710 --> 01:27:26,191
It must be 11:00a.m.
in California, USA.

710
01:27:28,111 --> 01:27:30,312
I wonder if she'll remember
our 8:00p.m. date here.

711
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:50,601
What a coincidence.

712
01:27:52,922 --> 01:27:55,362
Are you off duty tonight?

713
01:27:55,443 --> 01:27:56,323
Yes.

714
01:27:58,365 --> 01:28:00,205
How are you?

715
01:28:00,285 --> 01:28:02,566
No change. And you?

716
01:28:02,645 --> 01:28:05,126
Not bad.

717
01:28:05,207 --> 01:28:06,888
Alone?

718
01:28:06,967 --> 01:28:08,368
No. my friend's waiting.

719
01:28:11,649 --> 01:28:13,009
Your type.

720
01:28:14,131 --> 01:28:16,851
I still have some of your stuff.

721
01:28:16,931 --> 01:28:18,452
Will you pick it up sometime?

722
01:28:18,531 --> 01:28:21,734
Wouldn't want it anymore.
Throw it away.

723
01:28:24,095 --> 01:28:24,975
Okay.

724
01:28:29,256 --> 01:28:31,097
I have to rush.

725
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:35,459
I still think
you look better in uniform.

726
01:28:37,019 --> 01:28:37,940
So do you.

727
01:28:41,661 --> 01:28:43,262
Hey. you haven't paid!

728
01:28:43,342 --> 01:28:44,903
You pay for me!

729
01:29:14,595 --> 01:29:16,795
- How much is it?
- $262. please.

730
01:30:54,435 --> 01:30:56,356
The letter turned out to be
a boarding pass...

731
01:30:56,436 --> 01:30:58,957
post dated one year later.

732
01:30:59,037 --> 01:31:01,958
I couldn't make out
the destination.

733
01:31:14,563 --> 01:31:16,965
I did go to the restaurant
that evening.

734
01:31:17,044 --> 01:31:20,967
I knew it would get crowded
so I was thereat 7::15.

735
01:31:21,006 --> 01:31:23,007
It poured with rain outside.

736
01:31:23,087 --> 01:31:26,728
I watched it fall
through the window.

737
01:31:28,449 --> 01:31:30,610
And I urgently needed to know
if the other California...

738
01:31:30,650 --> 01:31:32,051
was warm and sunny.

739
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:33,851
I decided to give myself
one year.

740
01:31:35,973 --> 01:31:39,493
Tonight it's raining
as hard as it was then.

741
01:31:39,574 --> 01:31:41,334
Looking out this window...

742
01:31:41,415 --> 01:31:43,015
I have only one person
in my thoughts.

743
01:31:45,016 --> 01:31:46,937
I wonder if he ever
opened my letter.

744
01:32:43,119 --> 01:32:44,400
What are you doing here?

745
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:50,763
What are you doing here?

746
01:32:52,443 --> 01:32:53,444
Can that be you?

747
01:32:53,523 --> 01:32:56,365
What are you doing here?

748
01:32:56,445 --> 01:32:57,765
Renovating.

749
01:32:57,845 --> 01:32:58,726
Renovating?

750
01:33:00,726 --> 01:33:02,127
Where's my cousin?

751
01:33:02,167 --> 01:33:04,928
He opened a karaoke bar.

752
01:33:06,729 --> 01:33:08,810
Said he needed a change.

753
01:33:08,890 --> 01:33:11,130
So I took over here.
Didn't he tell you?

754
01:33:12,572 --> 01:33:15,333
I haven't seen him.

755
01:33:15,412 --> 01:33:18,734
He has great business sense.

756
01:33:18,813 --> 01:33:21,135
First he sold me
fish and chips...

757
01:33:21,215 --> 01:33:22,896
then the whole thing.

758
01:33:22,976 --> 01:33:24,376
What?

759
01:33:24,456 --> 01:33:26,456
I said. he has
great business sense!

760
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:34,780
When did you
get into this music?

761
01:33:37,102 --> 01:33:38,982
It takes time
to get used to things.

762
01:33:41,543 --> 01:33:43,743
Did you go to California?
Was it fun?

763
01:33:53,188 --> 01:33:55,589
Nothing special.

764
01:34:07,913 --> 01:34:09,435
You look good in uniform.

765
01:34:11,436 --> 01:34:13,797
You look nice like that too.

766
01:34:13,876 --> 01:34:16,116
Fancy a bite to eat?

767
01:34:16,157 --> 01:34:20,559
No. I fly out
very early tomorrow.

768
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:25,402
When will you get back?

769
01:34:25,441 --> 01:34:27,042
My grand opening
is two days away.

770
01:34:29,762 --> 01:34:33,324
Don't know.
This might be a long trip.

771
01:34:37,685 --> 01:34:40,327
Write to me when you reach
wherever it is.

772
01:34:42,928 --> 01:34:44,889
Would you read it if I did?

773
01:34:47,369 --> 01:34:49,251
One thing I must ask you.

774
01:34:59,695 --> 01:35:01,575
Would you let
a person on board...

775
01:35:01,616 --> 01:35:03,536
with a boarding pass like this?

776
01:35:08,618 --> 01:35:11,940
It's dated today.
but it got blurred in the rain.

777
01:35:11,979 --> 01:35:16,222
I don't know
where it's taking me. Do you?

778
01:35:18,743 --> 01:35:22,985
No idea.
but I'll give you another.

779
01:35:27,666 --> 01:35:28,586
Great.

780
01:35:39,472 --> 01:35:41,152
Where do you want to go?

781
01:35:42,192 --> 01:35:46,093
Wherever you want to take me.
