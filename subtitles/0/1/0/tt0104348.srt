1
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,658
2306, please.

2
00:02:40,414 --> 00:02:42,499
Hello, honey.
How you doing?

3
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:46,463
Good.
What did he say?

4
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:51,094
Uh-huh. Is he still there?
How long ago did he leave?

5
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:55,058
Uh-huh. I'm stopping here,
then I got a little meeting,

6
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:57,771
and then I'll--
I would if I could.

7
00:02:57,854 --> 00:03:00,983
As soon as I can.
Let me get off and I--

8
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:05,281
let me get off and I prom--
I promise you it'll be okay.

9
00:03:07,075 --> 00:03:11,165
A bunch of bullshit.
Waste a good man's time.

10
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:21,430
Hi, could I speak
to Dr. Lowenstein, please?

11
00:03:21,513 --> 00:03:24,141
It's rather important.
Could you get him for me?

12
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:26,895
Bunch of bullshit trying to make
a living on these deadbeat leads.

13
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:29,440
I swear to God, Shel,
I'm on a sit today--

14
00:03:29,482 --> 00:03:32,695
Hello, Mrs. Swoboda,
this is Dave Moss.

15
00:03:32,778 --> 00:03:34,781
Yeah, we spoke yesterday.

16
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:38,621
Now on the Rio Rancho Estates,
we've had a situation just come up.

17
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:41,290
The president of our company
is in town just one day,

18
00:03:41,374 --> 00:03:43,669
- and he has certain parcels--
- Doctor--

19
00:03:43,753 --> 00:03:46,756
well, could you get--
what do you mean?

20
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,553
He's not there?
I have to speak to him.

21
00:03:49,636 --> 00:03:53,600
Yes, it is fairly urgent.
Mr. Levene.

22
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:57,897
No, I can't be reached.
I'll get back to him.

23
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:00,191
He has certain parcels--
certain choice parcels

24
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:02,737
which he's given me
a hold on for the next 48 hours.

25
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:05,784
What would be the best time to get
you and your husband together?

26
00:04:05,826 --> 00:04:10,832
Say, tonight, at 10:00,
or tomorrow at 8:00?

27
00:04:10,874 --> 00:04:13,378
Okay.

28
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,048
Okay, what would be
the best time to do that?

29
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:21,430
Look, you sent in the--
no, no, listen to me now--

30
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:24,226
I've got 48 hours
to make you a lot of money.

31
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:29,943
Well, when will he be home?
Fine, I'll call you back in 10 minutes.

32
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,199
They don't give you the leads,
they don't give you the support,

33
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:36,118
- they don't give you dick.
- Yeah.

34
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,163
Then they're yanking us in
on some sales conference.

35
00:04:38,205 --> 00:04:41,333
When's the last time anybody
learned a goddamn thing?

36
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,795
All it does is some jerk
shoots his mouth off.

37
00:04:45,505 --> 00:04:48,886
I swear to God, Shel, I got half a mind
to go across the street.

38
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:51,473
I got half a mind to go
with you if they'd take me.

39
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:55,686
You never know-- I was talking
to Jerry Graff last week.

40
00:04:57,355 --> 00:04:59,943
I got to call
these deadbeats back.

41
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:03,240
I can't make a goddamn
dollar with these leads,

42
00:05:03,282 --> 00:05:05,158
and you're killing my ass
on the street.

43
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,537
- I'm sorry you aren't happy here.
- That's cute,

44
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,124
but you're running this office
like a bunch of bullshit.

45
00:05:10,207 --> 00:05:12,336
You're on an override--
you make money, we make money.

46
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,423
- I'd like you to make more money.
- Then don't go waste my time.

47
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:18,177
- A sales conference?
- The strategy comes from downtown.

48
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:20,513
Oh, the strategy?
The strategy?

49
00:05:20,597 --> 00:05:22,642
- Well, I think I'll pass.
- I wouldn't.

50
00:05:22,726 --> 00:05:25,563
- Why is that?
- When you come, then you'll see.

51
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:28,692
- Shelly.
- John.

52
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:30,819
Are you ready
to do or die tonight?

53
00:05:30,861 --> 00:05:32,822
Oh yeah,
always ready, John.

54
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:35,201
Always ready, John.
Now, one thing--

55
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:37,246
we were talking about the leads.
We got some new ones?

56
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,582
That's what we're going
to talk about at the meeting.

57
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:42,085
We are? Because I'm running
into a bit of a snag.

58
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:43,921
Yes, I've seen
your sales figures.

59
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:46,051
That's the leads.
You give me a better lead--

60
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:48,178
That's what we're going
to be talking about.

61
00:05:48,262 --> 00:05:50,056
I'm in a bind--
personal problems.

62
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:51,933
- I could use a leg up.
- After the meeting.

63
00:05:51,975 --> 00:05:55,187
- I hear the new Glengarry leads--
- After the meeting, Shel.

64
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,191
- Hey, Ricky.
- Hello, John.

65
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:59,819
- Wet out there tonight.
- Huh?

66
00:05:59,903 --> 00:06:04,367
- Wet out there tonight.
- Uh-huh.

67
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:06,621
- Maybe it'll break the heat.
- Yeah.

68
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:13,464
Al, give me a quick J&B, huh?
Double.

69
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:15,299
Cutty, Al.

70
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:20,891
- They say...
- Huh?

71
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:24,729
they say it was so hot
downtown this afternoon,

72
00:06:24,813 --> 00:06:29,319
grown men on the street corner
were going up to cops

73
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:32,074
begging the cops
to shoot them.

74
00:06:32,657 --> 00:06:36,955
They say you should not drink
alcohol when it's so hot.

75
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,294
- Who says that?
- Something I read.

76
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:44,716
For they say
it dehydrates you.

77
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,637
They say
you should drink water,

78
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:51,851
but I subscribe to the law
of contrary public opinion.

79
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:56,274
If everyone thinks one thing,
then I say bet the other way.

80
00:06:57,526 --> 00:06:59,487
Added to which,
you know they're wrong.

81
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:02,032
That's what I'm saying.

82
00:07:05,662 --> 00:07:08,667
- Slow tonight.
- Oh, yeah.

83
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,836
Well, I guess
everybody's staying home.

84
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,215
If my daughter calls,
anybody calls,

85
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:16,844
I'm over at the office.
Thanks.

86
00:07:49,557 --> 00:07:52,269
I had a woman
in White Plains on the hook--

87
00:07:52,352 --> 00:07:55,315
five units, Mountain View--
what happens?

88
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:57,193
She has to check
with her lawyer.

89
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,821
- You let her check with her lawyer?
- What could I do?

90
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:02,450
- I dunno.
- Shelly.

91
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:04,621
- Huh?
- Who's the guy?

92
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:06,623
Couldn't tell you.

93
00:08:06,707 --> 00:08:10,378
I don't like the whole thing,
because all I need is a lead.

94
00:08:10,462 --> 00:08:12,173
- They won't give out--
- Uh-huh.

95
00:08:12,256 --> 00:08:14,843
The rich get richer,
that's the law of the land.

96
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:17,097
Who belongs
to the BM--?

97
00:08:22,354 --> 00:08:24,231
It is 7:30.

98
00:08:24,273 --> 00:08:26,442
So who is that?

99
00:08:27,527 --> 00:08:29,448
And where is
Mr. Roma?

100
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:31,200
Well, I'm not a leash,
so I don't know, do I?

101
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:36,332
Let me have
your attention for a moment.

102
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:39,629
You're talking about what?
You're talking about--

103
00:08:41,005 --> 00:08:43,050
bitching about
that sale you shot,

104
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:45,344
some son of a bitch
don't want to buy land,

105
00:08:45,428 --> 00:08:46,762
somebody don't want
what you're selling,

106
00:08:46,804 --> 00:08:48,765
some broad you're
trying to screw, so forth.

107
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:50,895
Let's talk
about something important.

108
00:08:50,977 --> 00:08:52,605
- Are they all here?
- All but one.

109
00:08:52,646 --> 00:08:53,648
I'm going anyway.

110
00:08:53,689 --> 00:08:57,236
Let's talk
about something important.

111
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:59,697
Put that coffee down.

112
00:09:04,288 --> 00:09:07,292
Coffee's for closers only.

113
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:12,174
You think
I'm fucking with you?

114
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,432
I am not fucking with you.

115
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,352
I'm here from downtown.

116
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,979
I'm here
from Mitch and Murray.

117
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,191
And I'm here
on a mission of mercy.

118
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:32,578
- Your name's Levene?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:36,457
You call yourself a salesman,
you son of a bitch?

120
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,252
I don't got to listen
to this shit.

121
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:41,590
You certainly don't, 'cause
the good news is, you're fired.

122
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:46,138
The bad news is you've got--
all of you've got--

123
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:48,225
just one week
to regain your jobs,

124
00:09:48,307 --> 00:09:51,771
starting with tonight--
starting with tonight's sit.

125
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:57,655
Oh, have I got
your attention now?

126
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:01,577
Good...

127
00:10:03,163 --> 00:10:04,748
'cause we're adding
a little something

128
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:06,458
to this month's
sales contest.

129
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:09,630
As you all know, first prize
is a Cadillac Eldorado.

130
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:11,716
Anybody want to see
second prize?

131
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:15,221
Second prize is
a set of steak knives.

132
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:20,102
Third prize is you're fired.

133
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:27,531
Do you get the picture?
Are you laughing now?

134
00:10:27,613 --> 00:10:32,036
You got leads. Mitch and Murray
paid good money.

135
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,248
Get their names
to sell them.

136
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:36,334
You can't close
the leads you're given,

137
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:39,088
you can't close shit,
you are shit!

138
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:42,676
Hit the bricks, pal, and beat it,
'cause you are going out!

139
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,223
- The leads are weak.
- The leads are weak?

140
00:10:46,306 --> 00:10:49,019
The fucking leads are weak?
You're weak.

141
00:10:49,102 --> 00:10:51,063
I've been
in this business 15 years.

142
00:10:51,147 --> 00:10:53,441
- What's your name?
- Fuck you--

143
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:56,028
that's my name!
You know why, mister?

144
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:58,240
Because you drove a Hyundai
to get here tonight,

145
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:03,247
I drove an $80,000 BMW.
That's my name.

146
00:11:07,461 --> 00:11:10,549
And your name
is "You're wanting."

147
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:13,804
You can't play in the man's game?
You can't close them?

148
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:17,266
Then go home and tell your wife
your troubles.

149
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,022
Because only one thing
counts in this life--

150
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:24,486
get them to sign
on the line which is dotted!

151
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:27,490
You hear me,
you fucking faggots?

152
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,170
"A-B-C."

153
00:11:37,253 --> 00:11:40,216
A-- Always,
B-- Be, C-- Closing.

154
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,260
Always Be Closing.

155
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:45,975
"Always Be Closing."

156
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:48,728
"A-I-D-A."

157
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,481
"Attention, Interest,
Decision, Action."

158
00:11:51,565 --> 00:11:54,026
Attention--
Do I have your attention?

159
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,238
Interest--
Are you interested?

160
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,575
I know you are,
because it's fuck or walk.

161
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,620
You close
or you hit the bricks.

162
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:04,917
Decision-- Have you made
your decision for Christ?

163
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:09,674
And Action.
"A-I-D-A."

164
00:12:09,758 --> 00:12:12,052
Get out there--
you got the prospects coming in.

165
00:12:12,136 --> 00:12:14,264
You think they came in
to get out of the rain?

166
00:12:14,348 --> 00:12:16,767
A guy don't walk on the lot
lest he wants to buy.

167
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:20,106
They're sitting out there
waiting to give you their money.

168
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:22,234
Are you gonna take it?

169
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:25,447
Are you man enough
to take it?

170
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,875
Crap.

171
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,836
What's the problem, pal?
You-- Moss.

172
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,382
You're such a hero,
you're so rich,

173
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:41,719
how come you're here wasting
your time with a bunch of bums?

174
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:46,351
You see this watch?

175
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:52,776
- You see this watch?
- Yeah.

176
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,031
That watch costs
more than your car.

177
00:12:56,115 --> 00:13:00,162
I made $70,000 last year.
How much you make?

178
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:07,590
You see, pal... that's who I am,
and you're nothing.

179
00:13:07,672 --> 00:13:11,553
Nice guy?
I don't give a shit.

180
00:13:11,595 --> 00:13:15,600
Good father? Fuck you--
go home and play with your kids.

181
00:13:15,683 --> 00:13:20,149
You want to work here--
close!

182
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:23,487
You think this is abuse?

183
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,656
You think this is abuse,
you cocksucker?

184
00:13:25,697 --> 00:13:29,370
You can't take this, how can you
take the abuse you get on a sit?

185
00:13:30,455 --> 00:13:33,960
You don't like it, leave.

186
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,341
I can go out there tonight--
the materials you got--

187
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:43,516
make myself $15,000.
Tonight-- in two hours!

188
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,392
Can you?

189
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:49,189
Can you?

190
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:54,155
Go and do likewise.
"A-I-D-A."

191
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:56,825
Get mad, you son of a bitches.
Get mad!

192
00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:00,830
You know what it takes
to sell real estate?

193
00:14:00,914 --> 00:14:04,587
It takes brass balls
to sell real estate.

194
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:11,929
Go and do likewise,
gents.

195
00:14:12,013 --> 00:14:14,433
The money's out there--
you pick it up, it's yours,

196
00:14:14,474 --> 00:14:16,771
you don't,
I got no sympathy for you.

197
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:18,689
You want to go out
on those sits tonight and close--

198
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:20,483
close-- it's yours.

199
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:22,737
Not, you're gonna be
shining my shoes.

200
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,532
And you know
what you'll be saying.

201
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,245
Bunch of losers
sitting around in a bar,

202
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:32,417
"Oh yeah, I used to be a salesman.
It's a tough racket."

203
00:14:41,138 --> 00:14:43,558
These are the new leads.

204
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:46,687
These are
the Glengarry leads.

205
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:51,444
And to you, they're gold.
And you don't get them.

206
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:54,282
Why?

207
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:58,370
Because to give them to you
is just throwing them away.

208
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:04,838
They're for closers.

209
00:15:10,887 --> 00:15:12,139
I'd wish you good luck,

210
00:15:12,223 --> 00:15:14,435
but you wouldn't know what
to do with it if you got it.

211
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:23,614
And to answer your question, pal--
"Why am I here?"

212
00:15:23,697 --> 00:15:26,661
I came here because
Mitch and Murray asked me to.

213
00:15:26,744 --> 00:15:29,456
They asked me for a favor.
I said, "The real favor--

214
00:15:29,498 --> 00:15:32,502
follow my advice
and fire your fucking ass,

215
00:15:32,585 --> 00:15:35,088
because a loser
is a loser."

216
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:48,692
Bunch of fucking nonsense--

217
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:51,487
treat people like that.

218
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,201
The fuck is he going
to get off?

219
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:59,664
- Mickey Mouse sales conference.
- He didn't mean it.

220
00:15:59,706 --> 00:16:02,586
I'm sure he didn't mean it about
trimming down the sales quota.

221
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,839
Where is Roma?
Where the hell is Mr. Ricky Roma?

222
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:07,300
All the while we got to sit here,
eat this nonsense?

223
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:10,514
Hello? Mr. Levene.
How's she doing?

224
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:12,558
Uh-huh, yeah.
Is she awake?

225
00:16:12,642 --> 00:16:15,187
Oh, the doctor came by.
What did he say?

226
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:18,817
Uh-huh.
I can't come in tonight.

227
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:21,654
I think-- I know she is.
I know that she is.

228
00:16:21,738 --> 00:16:25,577
I've gotta go out. Will you please
tell her when she wakes?

229
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,624
I've got to go out.
Tell her I'll call her from the road.

230
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:31,292
Thank you.

231
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:36,718
Gentlemen,
you heard the man.

232
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,554
What is this in aid of?

233
00:16:38,637 --> 00:16:40,723
- As of tonight--
- What is this? Excuse me.

234
00:16:40,806 --> 00:16:42,976
What it's in aid of
is that Mitch and Murray--

235
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,772
Fuck Mitch and Murray!
I'm doing my job,

236
00:16:45,854 --> 00:16:47,649
I got to put up
with this childishness?

237
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:49,611
I don't make the rules.
I'm paid to run the office.

238
00:16:49,653 --> 00:16:52,030
You don't like the rules, Dave?
There's the door!

239
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:58,541
Two lead cards for tonight,
two lead cards for tomorrow.

240
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,334
As you heard,
end of the month,

241
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:02,504
top salesman on the board
gets the Eldorado.

242
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:04,715
- Next man down the--
- What about the good leads?

243
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:07,135
- The leads I've given you.
- But these leads are shit.

244
00:17:07,218 --> 00:17:09,054
They're old--
I've seen that name 100 times.

245
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:12,226
- The leads are assigned randomly.
- What about the new leads?

246
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,103
The new leads--
the Glengarry leads.

247
00:17:14,187 --> 00:17:16,524
I've got them.
I'm going to hang onto them.

248
00:17:16,606 --> 00:17:18,693
And they'll be
assigned to closers,

249
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:21,114
based on the sales volume,
first to Roma.

250
00:17:21,197 --> 00:17:23,117
- Where is Roma?
- Don't worry about Roma.

251
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,827
He'll get his leads,
you've got yours.

252
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:27,038
He's top name on the board,
so he don't have to be here?

253
00:17:27,122 --> 00:17:29,583
That's correct!
And as the hour is waning,

254
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:32,505
I suggest you-- those of you
who are interested

255
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:35,384
in a continuing job with
this organization, get to work.

256
00:17:35,467 --> 00:17:37,470
That's garbage.
Bullshit.

257
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:39,264
- Thank you for your attention.
- Bullshit!

258
00:17:39,306 --> 00:17:43,436
How am I supposed to close these?
Look at this.

259
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,483
I've had this guy before.
I've been to his house twice.

260
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:50,279
I-- I can't--
I can't close this stuff.

261
00:17:53,117 --> 00:17:56,038
Shelly, how am I
supposed to--

262
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:58,792
They're going
to bounce me out of a job.

263
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:10,392
Hello, Mr. Palermo?
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:10,475 --> 00:18:13,855
Mr. Speice?
Mr. Robert Speice?

265
00:18:13,897 --> 00:18:16,858
Yeah,
this is George Aaronow.

266
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:20,030
I'm with Rio.
I spoke with your wife earlier.

267
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:23,660
I'm the vice president of Rio Rancho
Properties in Furman, Arizona.

268
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:28,959
Yes. I'm calling from the airport,
and consulting my map,

269
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,254
I see that you and your wife
live near the airport.

270
00:18:31,338 --> 00:18:34,342
I have some rather--
rather unusual,

271
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:36,678
rather good information
on the property...

272
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,143
Hello? Hello, this is
Sheldon Levene.

273
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:43,563
Please listen closely--
I only have a moment or so.

274
00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:47,235
I can speak only
to a Mrs. Nyborg.

275
00:18:47,277 --> 00:18:51,240
Oh, this is Mrs. Nyborg.
Please listen closely, Mrs. Nyborg.

276
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:55,037
I'm calling from Consolidated
Properties of Arizona.

277
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:58,835
Our computer has chosen you
from all of the many thousands

278
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:01,755
who write in requesting
information on our properties.

279
00:19:01,797 --> 00:19:04,801
Now by federal law,
as you probably know,

280
00:19:04,884 --> 00:19:08,056
the prize must be awarded to you
even if you are not engaged

281
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:10,142
in our land
development plan.

282
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:13,855
The only stipulation, of course,
is that you and your husband

283
00:19:13,938 --> 00:19:17,069
must sign at the same time
for the receipt of your prize.

284
00:19:17,153 --> 00:19:21,575
Now, I will be in the area
tonight, possibly tomorrow.

285
00:19:21,616 --> 00:19:24,203
What do you think might be
a convenient time to meet

286
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,415
with both you
and your husband?

287
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:29,086
Of course I'll hold.

288
00:19:42,271 --> 00:19:44,941
- Bunch of fucking nonsense, huh?
- I can't close them.

289
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,526
- Nobody can close 'em.
- They're old.

290
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,780
They're ancient--
a bunch of fucking nonsense.

291
00:19:48,864 --> 00:19:51,158
Get some jerk
to come in here--

292
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:54,037
Sometimes I think,
"I wonder if I belong in this business."

293
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:56,500
Send a guy out there--
no support, no confidence.

294
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,211
Then I say,
"Nobody can close 'em."

295
00:19:59,294 --> 00:20:01,797
- Then I look at Roma.
- Roma-- fuck Roma.

296
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:03,969
Had a freak--
a little run of luck.

297
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,472
The leads are garbage.

298
00:20:06,514 --> 00:20:08,641
Then I say,
"Why give him the good leads?

299
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:10,811
- He doesn't need 'em."
- You going out?

300
00:20:10,894 --> 00:20:15,484
Yeah. I have to go out.
I can't make a sit.

301
00:20:15,568 --> 00:20:19,490
- Have you tried?
- Yeah. Something's wrong with me.

302
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:21,534
What is it?
I can't push through.

303
00:20:21,576 --> 00:20:23,829
Get your coat on.
You're coming out with me.

304
00:20:23,871 --> 00:20:25,998
- Something in me.
- Forget it.

305
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,128
- I try, I try.
- I said forget it, come on.

306
00:20:29,212 --> 00:20:31,465
I can't close 'em.

307
00:20:35,054 --> 00:20:36,723
Life.

308
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:39,018
I swear to God,
you work all your life--

309
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:43,190
- Forget it, George.
- Roma, so on...

310
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:45,693
- so gifted.
- Gifted, my ass!

311
00:20:45,735 --> 00:20:49,323
- The guy gets a string of luck.
- No, no, no.

312
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:51,077
The thing of it is,
money's tight.

313
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,038
When times are tight,
it don't do no good

314
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:55,458
to throw around,
"Just go out and sell."

315
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:58,252
Threaten a man all you want,
you can't whip a dead horse.

316
00:20:58,336 --> 00:20:59,880
- Nope.
- All this garbage--

317
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:01,425
"Sell 10,000,
you win a Cadillac;

318
00:21:01,508 --> 00:21:04,762
you lose, we're gonna fire
your ass"? It's medieval.

319
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,014
- Yes.
- It's wrong.

320
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:07,558
- Yes.
- Yes it is,

321
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,185
and you know
who's responsible?

322
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,229
- Who?
- You know who it is.

323
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:13,191
It's Mitch and Murray,
'cause it don't have to be this way.

324
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:15,278
- No.
- Look at Jerry Graff.

325
00:21:15,318 --> 00:21:17,363
He's clean, he's doing
business for himself,

326
00:21:17,405 --> 00:21:19,575
he's got that list--
with the nurses?

327
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:24,080
You see? That's thinking.
Why take a 10% sales commission?

328
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:27,377
Why are we giving the rest away?
What are we giving 90% for?

329
00:21:27,711 --> 00:21:30,340
For nothing.
For some jerk in the office,

330
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:32,760
telling us, "Get out there and close,
go win a Cadillac."

331
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:35,430
Graff goes out and buys.
He pays top dollar.

332
00:21:35,513 --> 00:21:36,933
- You see?
- Yes.

333
00:21:37,016 --> 00:21:39,979
For the leads-- that's thinking.
Now, he's got the leads,

334
00:21:40,062 --> 00:21:44,235
he goes in business for himself.
That's what? That's thinking.

335
00:21:44,318 --> 00:21:46,278
Who-- who's got
a steady job,

336
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,449
a regular job,
a couple of bucks nobody's touched?

337
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:50,035
Nurses.

338
00:21:50,118 --> 00:21:51,745
Graff goes and buys
a fucking list of nurses. One grand--

339
00:21:51,787 --> 00:21:54,165
he paid two, I'll eat my hat.
4,000 or 5,000 nurses.

340
00:21:54,248 --> 00:21:56,626
- He's going wild.
- He is?

341
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,923
- Yeah, he's doing very well.
- I heard they were running cold.

342
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:01,801
- The nurses?
- Yeah.

343
00:22:01,884 --> 00:22:05,055
You hear a lot of things.
He's doing very well.

344
00:22:05,139 --> 00:22:06,975
- With River Oaks?
- River Oaks, Brook Farms.

345
00:22:07,058 --> 00:22:09,770
All that shit. Somebody told me--
you know what he's clearing, himself?

346
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:12,609
- 14, 15 grand a week.
- Himself?

347
00:22:12,691 --> 00:22:16,030
That's what I'm saying.
Why? He's got the leads.

348
00:22:16,112 --> 00:22:19,159
He's got the good leads.
What are we?

349
00:22:19,242 --> 00:22:20,994
We're sitting
in the shit here. Why?

350
00:22:21,078 --> 00:22:22,914
Because we got to go to them
to get them.

351
00:22:22,997 --> 00:22:25,877
90% of our sales we're paying
to the office for the leads.

352
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,381
There's our leads, there's overhead,
phones, a lot of stuff.

353
00:22:29,465 --> 00:22:31,426
What do you need?
A telephone?

354
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:34,639
Some broad to say, "Good morning"?
Nothing. It's the leads.

355
00:22:35,014 --> 00:22:37,310
The whole thing is the leads,
you understand me?

356
00:22:37,393 --> 00:22:40,188
You can't sell to a void--
you got to get a goddamn person.

357
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:42,817
You get a lead, you get
a person-- I'll go sell 'em.

358
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,694
Otherwise, what do they want
from my life?

359
00:22:45,153 --> 00:22:48,784
Hello, Danny?
Dan, it's Shel Levene.

360
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,914
Yeah, we spoke--
last May I called you.

361
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:55,168
I was in town from my estate
in Rio Rancho, and--

362
00:22:55,251 --> 00:22:56,962
Arizona.

363
00:22:57,045 --> 00:22:59,299
I wish we could have
gotten together at that time.

364
00:22:59,341 --> 00:23:03,096
Danny, that piece of property I had
for you has increased in value--

365
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:08,394
Grace, Grace,
what was that figure? $76,000.

366
00:23:08,477 --> 00:23:10,940
Oh, Danny, I wish you could have
been in on it with me.

367
00:23:10,982 --> 00:23:13,610
Look, I'm here overnight--
I have to go home tomorrow,

368
00:23:13,652 --> 00:23:17,533
and I thought, after the interest
you showed on the last trip, that--

369
00:23:17,616 --> 00:23:21,497
Hold it, Grace. Danny,
I know that you're serious,

370
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:24,626
and because of that, I am going
to shove my appointments around

371
00:23:24,709 --> 00:23:28,757
and make sure--
oh, gee, I wish that--

372
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:33,806
All right, Danny.
Yeah, all right.

373
00:23:44,446 --> 00:23:47,658
Going out tonight,
Shelly?

374
00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:53,500
What is this bullshit
with the sales promotion?

375
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:55,044
It isn't bullshit.
It's the way it is.

376
00:23:55,128 --> 00:23:57,214
You're going to fire
the bottom men on the list?

377
00:23:57,297 --> 00:23:59,717
That's the way it is
and I don't make the rules.

378
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:03,096
- The rules come from downtown.
- I got a problem here, John.

379
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,683
- I'm closing up the office.
- Come have a drink with me.

380
00:24:05,725 --> 00:24:09,022
- I've got to get home.
- Do me the courtesy-- five minutes?

381
00:24:09,063 --> 00:24:11,234
I am trying to get home
for two hours.

382
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:14,321
I got to go home, grab one hour
with my kids, come back here,

383
00:24:14,404 --> 00:24:16,866
see if any of you closed
a contract, take the contract--

384
00:24:16,949 --> 00:24:20,497
- How about one minute?
- What is it?

385
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,625
- I can't close these leads.
- Then move on.

386
00:24:22,707 --> 00:24:26,588
Don't jump! Don't jump out
of your manager bag a second.

387
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,887
It's just two guys talking,
am I right? We're just talking.

388
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,557
You got the new leads.
If you would give me-- just hold on.

389
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,393
The Glengarry leads are to be
assigned only to closers.

390
00:24:36,477 --> 00:24:39,231
Hold on a second.
If you give me the good leads--

391
00:24:39,272 --> 00:24:40,900
You blew the last good one
I gave you.

392
00:24:40,983 --> 00:24:42,653
No, no-- hold on,
will you?

393
00:24:42,736 --> 00:24:45,323
I did not blow 'em.
One kicked out. One, I closed.

394
00:24:45,407 --> 00:24:47,284
- You didn't close it.
- Would you listen to me?

395
00:24:47,368 --> 00:24:51,164
I closed that cocksucker!
His ex! John, his ex!

396
00:24:51,248 --> 00:24:53,710
I didn't even know he was married.
The judge invalidated it.

397
00:24:53,794 --> 00:24:54,670
Shelly--

398
00:24:54,753 --> 00:24:57,298
What was that job, huh?
Bad luck. That's all it was.

399
00:24:57,382 --> 00:24:59,551
I pray you never find it--
it runs in streaks.

400
00:24:59,593 --> 00:25:02,514
That's what it's doing,
that's all it does-- streaks.

401
00:25:02,597 --> 00:25:06,187
I pray that it misses you
and that's all I have to say.

402
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,232
Shit, I've got to eat.
Williamson--

403
00:25:09,315 --> 00:25:13,446
look at the sheets.
Look at the sheets.

404
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:17,244
1987, '88, '89--
six months in '89-- who's on top?

405
00:25:17,286 --> 00:25:18,787
- Roma.
- Under him?

406
00:25:18,787 --> 00:25:21,583
- Moss.
- Oh, bullshit, John!

407
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:24,253
April to September it's me--
it's no fucking Moss.

408
00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:26,673
Due respect,
he's an order-taker.

409
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:30,428
Talk-- talks a good game,
but look on the board, it's me.

410
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:32,682
- Not lately it isn't.
- Not late--

411
00:25:33,475 --> 00:25:35,143
Well, lately--
kiss my ass "lately."

412
00:25:35,227 --> 00:25:37,897
You call Murray and you call Mitch--
when we were on Peterson,

413
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,609
who do you think bought the new car?
Call Mitch. The Seville?

414
00:25:40,693 --> 00:25:43,781
He came in here--
"You bought that for me, fella."

415
00:25:43,865 --> 00:25:47,786
And out of what? Hey, look at me!
Out of what? Nothing!

416
00:25:47,828 --> 00:25:50,080
Cold calling.
You want to talk about a sale?

417
00:25:50,164 --> 00:25:52,668
You are really
beginning to burn my ass, kid.

418
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:57,091
I can't get a lead, you--
it was skill, John.

419
00:25:57,174 --> 00:25:59,636
It could be working for you--
you want to throw it away.

420
00:25:59,678 --> 00:26:01,889
- It isn't me.
- It's not you--

421
00:26:01,972 --> 00:26:04,477
I wonder who it is.
Who the fuck am I talking to?

422
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,315
- I need the leads to sell.
- After the contest. After the 30th.

423
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:10,651
Bullshit,
"After the contest."

424
00:26:10,693 --> 00:26:13,405
If I'm not on that board by the 30th,
they're going to can my ass.

425
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:20,207
I need those leads
and I need 'em now or I'm out.

426
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:31,139
You're going to miss me.
I swear to you, you will miss me.

427
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:32,975
Let me tell you
something, Shelly.

428
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:36,063
I do what I'm hired to do--
you might do the same.

429
00:26:36,146 --> 00:26:38,024
- Jesus.
- Now wait a second!

430
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:43,573
I'm hired to watch the leads,
to marshal my sales force.

431
00:26:43,615 --> 00:26:45,742
I'm given a policy.
My job is to do that.

432
00:26:45,826 --> 00:26:47,871
Marshal your sales force?

433
00:26:47,954 --> 00:26:50,626
Anybody falls below
a certain mark, I'm directed.

434
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,669
I'm not permitted
to give them the premium leads.

435
00:26:52,753 --> 00:26:56,675
How do they rise
above that mark? With dreck?

436
00:26:56,716 --> 00:26:59,053
With this toilet paper
you're giving me?

437
00:26:59,137 --> 00:27:00,723
You give me
one premium lead--

438
00:27:00,807 --> 00:27:02,517
Do you know what
the premium leads cost?

439
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,853
Do I know what
the premium leads cost?

440
00:27:04,895 --> 00:27:06,355
Yeah,
I know what they cost.

441
00:27:06,397 --> 00:27:09,651
I generated the sufficient
dollar revenue to buy them.

442
00:27:09,735 --> 00:27:12,698
But I cannot sell shit!

443
00:27:12,782 --> 00:27:15,369
Jesus. And I've seen
these before, you know.

444
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,371
Christ, I saw these back--
Homestead--

445
00:27:17,412 --> 00:27:19,750
1985, we pitched
these cocksuckers Baywater.

446
00:27:19,832 --> 00:27:24,130
They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.
They're broke. They're deadbeats.

447
00:27:24,214 --> 00:27:27,135
Just give me some leads that don't
come out of a phone book.

448
00:27:27,218 --> 00:27:29,889
You give me something hotter
than that and I can close it.

449
00:27:29,972 --> 00:27:32,183
It's just a streak.
I'm gonna turn it around.

450
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:35,522
Hey, I need your help.

451
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,487
I can't do it,
Shelly.

452
00:27:45,827 --> 00:27:48,039
John...

453
00:27:48,123 --> 00:27:50,751
I'll give you 10%.

454
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,421
- Of what?
- My end-- what I close.

455
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,426
You give me the premium leads,
you're in for 10%, what I close.

456
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:58,344
- And what if you don't close?
- I will.

457
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:00,432
- What if you don't close?
- I will close.

458
00:28:00,515 --> 00:28:02,601
What if you don't,
you understand?

459
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:05,605
Then I'm fucked. You think you're
the only guy with a family?

460
00:28:05,647 --> 00:28:07,400
- You see what I'm saying?
- John--

461
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:09,736
I step out and you don't close,
then it's my job.

462
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:11,782
- Then I'm fucked.
- I will close!

463
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,576
Now, 10%John--
I can get hot, you know that.

464
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,205
- Not lately you can't.
- That's defeatist-- fuck it!

465
00:28:17,288 --> 00:28:20,209
Go with me. Get on my side
and let's do something.

466
00:28:20,293 --> 00:28:22,964
You want to run this office?
You heard what the man said--

467
00:28:23,006 --> 00:28:25,467
"Attack."
Let's do something.

468
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:29,932
- Huh?
- 20%.

469
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,980
- All right.
- And 50 bucks a lead.

470
00:28:34,021 --> 00:28:36,023
- No?
- Oh!

471
00:28:42,907 --> 00:28:44,660
Oh, shit.

472
00:28:58,097 --> 00:29:02,394
Listen...
I got to talk to you.

473
00:29:02,477 --> 00:29:07,359
Permit me to do this a second.
I'm older than you.

474
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:10,740
A man acquires a reputation
on the street.

475
00:29:10,823 --> 00:29:13,535
What he does when he's up,
what he does at other times...

476
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:16,831
I said, "10," you said, "No."
You said, "20," I said, "Fine."

477
00:29:16,873 --> 00:29:20,295
Now you want to throw
this 50-buck thing in.

478
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:25,218
John, a good deal-- has got to be
one where both parties--

479
00:29:25,301 --> 00:29:28,514
Okay, okay, okay, fine--
20%, 50 bucks a lead. It's done.

480
00:29:28,597 --> 00:29:30,517
Let's go out.
We make some money.

481
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,188
I got bills to pay.
I want two sits tonight

482
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,941
and I want the good leads--
the Glengarry leads-- two.

483
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:38,195
Two, John, because
I am going to close 'em both.

484
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,073
It's a long road
with no turning, pally.

485
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:44,037
Huh? Okay.
Now, let's go.

486
00:29:44,078 --> 00:29:46,707
I've got to go back
to the office to get 'em.

487
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:50,670
Go on, let's go.
This is what I was saying, John.

488
00:29:50,754 --> 00:29:53,424
All you need, a little boost,
you turn a streak around.

489
00:29:53,507 --> 00:29:56,554
Am I right? Good, huh?
Huh, good?

490
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:59,057
What?

491
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:01,894
- What?
- Two leads, 100 bucks.

492
00:30:01,936 --> 00:30:04,064
- Now?
- Now, yes. When?

493
00:30:04,105 --> 00:30:06,402
- Shit, John.
- I wish I could.

494
00:30:06,443 --> 00:30:09,155
You fucking asshole.

495
00:30:09,238 --> 00:30:12,493
I don't have it--
I don't--

496
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,913
I'll bring it in the office
in the morning.

497
00:30:14,955 --> 00:30:17,374
- I'll be coming with the sales.
- Nope.

498
00:30:19,795 --> 00:30:22,507
I can't fucking
believe this.

499
00:30:22,591 --> 00:30:25,928
All right, here's...

500
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,806
20... 30, and--

501
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,437
Jesus, here's the 30.
I'll bring the rest in tomorrow.

502
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,731
We got to do this, huh, pal?
For Christ's sake!

503
00:30:33,815 --> 00:30:35,609
No.

504
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:41,618
- My daughter...
- I can't do it, Shelly.

505
00:30:41,702 --> 00:30:44,789
I got to tell you something.
It wasn't so long ago,

506
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:48,710
I'd pick up the phone
and call Murray-- I got your job.

507
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:52,173
"Murray, the kid is burning my ass."
"Shelly, he's gone."

508
00:30:52,257 --> 00:30:57,056
You are gone before
I'm back from lunch.

509
00:30:57,139 --> 00:30:58,849
Bought him a trip
to Bermuda once.

510
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:00,769
- I've got to go.
- All right, hey.

511
00:31:00,811 --> 00:31:05,360
Give me-- I'll take two more
of the old leads.

512
00:31:05,443 --> 00:31:08,030
- I gave you two today.
- One is a bust-out, John!

513
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:10,074
- The other ain't home!
- Shelly--

514
00:31:10,157 --> 00:31:11,284
I promise you,
I've been on the phone-- I know.

515
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:13,036
No more leads today--
two per day. You've got yours.

516
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,122
All right.

517
00:31:15,205 --> 00:31:17,627
- All right?
- Sure.

518
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:27,307
We will do that...
other thing.

519
00:31:29,018 --> 00:31:32,189
I guess I left
my wallet in my room.

520
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:41,369
Deadbeats.
Deadbeats, all of 'em.

521
00:31:41,452 --> 00:31:45,165
My mistake.
I shouldn't have took the leads.

522
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:47,502
- You had to.
- Yeah? Why?

523
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:49,838
- To get on the--
- To get on the board, yeah.

524
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,008
How am I gonna get on the board
trying to sell a doctor?

525
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,844
Two regular,
two chocolate donuts.

526
00:31:53,886 --> 00:31:56,974
Give me the same thing to go.
And don't try and sell an Indian.

527
00:31:57,056 --> 00:31:58,725
I will never try to sell
an Indian.

528
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:01,062
These names come up--
you ever get 'em-- "Patel"?

529
00:32:01,146 --> 00:32:04,109
- You ever get 'em?
- I think I had one once.

530
00:32:04,192 --> 00:32:06,487
You had one,
you'd know it-- "Patel."

531
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,197
They keep coming up.
I don't know.

532
00:32:08,281 --> 00:32:10,618
They like to talk to salesmen.
They're lonely.

533
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,413
They like to feel superior--
never bought a fucking thing.

534
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:16,084
I don't know.
Come down the line--

535
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:20,632
doctors, lawyers, Indians--
times are tight. It's tight.

536
00:32:20,715 --> 00:32:25,223
Pressure's just too great.
Man can't work all of 'em.

537
00:32:25,263 --> 00:32:29,019
You go in the door-- I got to close
this fucker or I don't eat lunch,

538
00:32:29,102 --> 00:32:32,816
or I don't win a Cadillac.
We work too hard, George.

539
00:32:35,027 --> 00:32:40,285
Remember when we were-- when we
were selling Glen Ross Farms?

540
00:32:40,368 --> 00:32:42,621
Didn't we sell
a bunch of that?

541
00:32:42,705 --> 00:32:44,875
- They came in--
- They fucked it up.

542
00:32:44,957 --> 00:32:46,877
- They did.
- They killed the goose. And now...

543
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,256
- We're stuck with this--
- Stuck with this fucking shit.

544
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:50,966
- This shit.
- It's too...

545
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,303
- It is.
- You get a bad month--

546
00:32:53,387 --> 00:32:56,808
they put you on this board.
Some contest board.

547
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,353
- It's not right.
- It's not right to the customers.

548
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:01,732
I know, it's-- hey. What did I learn
as a kid on Western?

549
00:33:03,443 --> 00:33:07,782
Don't sell a guy one car.
Sell him five cars over 15 years.

550
00:33:07,865 --> 00:33:09,576
- That's right.
- You're goddamn right, it's right.

551
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,622
Guys come in-- "Oh, the blah,
blah, blah. I know what I'll do.

552
00:33:12,706 --> 00:33:15,125
I'll go out and rob everybody
blind and go to Argentina

553
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:17,045
'cause nobody ever
thought of this before."

554
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,966
So they kill the goose
and the man's worked all his life--

555
00:33:20,048 --> 00:33:21,968
- That's right.
- He's got to cower in his boots--

556
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:23,095
Boots, yes...

557
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:26,517
For some fucking "Sell 10,000,
win the steak knives."

558
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,478
- What do you do?
- What can you do?

559
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,981
What can you do
if you don't have the leads?

560
00:33:31,023 --> 00:33:33,776
If you do not
have the goddamn leads!

561
00:33:33,985 --> 00:33:36,865
Mr. Spannel?
Sheldon Levene.

562
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,950
I was speaking
to your wife earlier?

563
00:33:39,034 --> 00:33:40,912
Come in.

564
00:33:42,206 --> 00:33:44,375
- "Cats and dogs," huh?
- Yeah.

565
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:47,088
Oh, "cats and dogs."

566
00:33:49,382 --> 00:33:52,178
Oh, I see you're
interested in fishing.

567
00:33:52,261 --> 00:33:54,973
- Yeah.
- I've fished myself-- many years.

568
00:33:55,015 --> 00:33:57,852
Muskee, Wisconsin.
Ooh, a beauty.

569
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,609
- Where's the missus?
- Out at the PTA.

570
00:34:02,693 --> 00:34:04,528
- Ahh.
- What was this in reference...?

571
00:34:04,611 --> 00:34:06,656
I spoke to your wife
earlier on the phone.

572
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,659
I called, I'm in town
with Rio Rancho.

573
00:34:08,701 --> 00:34:11,914
Yes, I'm sorry. She said you had
some sort of award?

574
00:34:11,998 --> 00:34:15,252
Yes, I was speaking to the people
in my sales organization--

575
00:34:15,335 --> 00:34:19,090
my representatives in this area--
and Mr. Spannel--

576
00:34:19,173 --> 00:34:22,012
your name is Larry.
Mind if I call you Larry?

577
00:34:22,054 --> 00:34:25,767
All right, Larry.
We had a consultant,

578
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:28,979
and he made me--
he made me an offer.

579
00:34:29,063 --> 00:34:32,610
He offered me $230,000
to promote a sales plan--

580
00:34:32,693 --> 00:34:37,199
to present investment opportunities
in Rio Rancho to the public.

581
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:40,537
Well, I said, "Hell,
let me save you the 230,

582
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,667
and pass the savings
along to the investor."

583
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,922
My people immediately said,
"Whoa, how do you do that?

584
00:34:47,005 --> 00:34:49,967
How can you present
investment opportunities

585
00:34:50,051 --> 00:34:52,221
without television,
without magazine ads?"

586
00:34:52,304 --> 00:34:54,223
I said, "You take
something this good,

587
00:34:54,264 --> 00:34:56,519
you go to a man--
has invested in the past--

588
00:34:56,561 --> 00:35:00,441
you go to him direct and offer
the money to him-- rebate.

589
00:35:00,524 --> 00:35:03,653
And don't give it
to this expert."

590
00:35:05,072 --> 00:35:07,116
So you're here
to sell me some land?

591
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:09,370
No, I wouldn't try
to sell you--

592
00:35:09,454 --> 00:35:12,792
I leave that to the salesmen
and people who want to own land.

593
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:15,628
I think something
has to be fed,

594
00:35:15,712 --> 00:35:18,633
watered and painted,
but don't invest in it.

595
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:21,220
That motto has stood me
in good stead.

596
00:35:21,304 --> 00:35:23,515
- Mister--
- Just call me Shelly.

597
00:35:23,598 --> 00:35:25,809
I have never
been afraid of familiarity.

598
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:27,896
I'm walking out the door.
I've got to pick up my wife at the--

599
00:35:27,979 --> 00:35:30,399
Let's take my car.
We'll pick her up together.

600
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:32,694
Spoke to the little woman
on the phone-- can't wait to meet her.

601
00:35:32,778 --> 00:35:34,572
No, we're going
over to our relatives'.

602
00:35:34,614 --> 00:35:37,284
- She didn't say anything about that.
- I'm sure she forgot.

603
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:39,996
- I'm on a plane to Florida--
- I'm sorry if we put you out.

604
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,584
You didn't put me out.
I'm just trying to think, Larry.

605
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:45,254
You know, that's the only parcel
that I've got.

606
00:35:45,296 --> 00:35:48,049
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go back to the computer,

607
00:35:48,132 --> 00:35:51,262
I'm gonna pull another one, and we're
gonna speak to your relatives, too.

608
00:35:51,346 --> 00:35:53,724
- No, no, no.
- C'mon, you're a busy man, so am I.

609
00:35:53,807 --> 00:35:56,645
My God, I'm in the act
of giving a gift away.

610
00:35:56,728 --> 00:35:59,649
Look, I don't want to buy land.
I don't want to invest in land.

611
00:35:59,733 --> 00:36:04,280
I have nothing. She took the call
without my knowledge.

612
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:06,618
I have no business
that I wish to transact.

613
00:36:06,701 --> 00:36:08,537
I don't want to tell you
how to handle your wife.

614
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,459
My wife filled in a form, and we
have been plagued for the last year--

615
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:15,504
That's the situation
I'm trying to alleviate, Larry.

616
00:36:15,546 --> 00:36:17,341
No, no.
Do you understand?

617
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,429
Thank you. No.

618
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,412
- Roma, man-- he don't care.
- He don't care.

619
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:41,876
He's sitting on top of the world.
He's got good leads, good prospects.

620
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:44,338
- Sales, sales.
- Sales contests.

621
00:36:44,421 --> 00:36:47,216
- That's what I'm saying.
- Times turn hard, they bounce you out.

622
00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:49,302
If they bounce you with no
confidence--

623
00:36:49,386 --> 00:36:51,974
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying to you.

624
00:36:57,355 --> 00:36:59,817
If they get you
on a bad beat--

625
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,362
and you got to go out there,
get a new job--

626
00:37:02,446 --> 00:37:04,198
- With no--
- With no confidence--

627
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,826
Yes.

628
00:37:05,868 --> 00:37:10,124
I'll tell you what the hard part is--
to stop thinking like a goddamn slave.

629
00:37:10,206 --> 00:37:13,669
You say the Nazis
in Europe--
"If they came in my door"--

630
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:16,133
bullshit, the time is now.
What do you do now?

631
00:37:16,215 --> 00:37:18,511
Some guy pissing in your face.
Cocksucker--

632
00:37:18,594 --> 00:37:21,056
wants to break your rice bowl.

633
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:24,686
Mitch and Murray, fuck you.
What I say-- fuck you!

634
00:37:24,768 --> 00:37:27,565
Sitting on the good leads.

635
00:37:27,648 --> 00:37:30,486
George, we're men here.

636
00:37:31,904 --> 00:37:33,073
Yes.

637
00:37:33,156 --> 00:37:37,078
And I'll tell you--
I'll tell you what the hard part is.

638
00:37:37,161 --> 00:37:39,749
- What?
- Starting up.

639
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:42,545
Standing up.
Breaking free of this bullshit,

640
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:46,341
this enslavement to some guy,
'cause he's got the upper hand.

641
00:37:49,095 --> 00:37:52,058
This is the difference--
listen to me, George.

642
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:54,269
Now Jerry Graff went
into business for himself.

643
00:37:54,353 --> 00:37:59,943
He said, "I'm going on my own."
And he was free, you understand me?

644
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:04,158
I'll tell you-- I'll tell you
what somebody should do.

645
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:08,206
What?

646
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:10,917
Somebody should stand up
and strike back.

647
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:13,297
Somebody should do something
to them.

648
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,591
- What?
- Something to pay them back.

649
00:38:15,675 --> 00:38:17,510
Someone should hurt them,
Mitch and Murray.

650
00:38:17,594 --> 00:38:19,263
- Somebody should hurt them?
- Yeah.

651
00:38:19,346 --> 00:38:21,223
- How?
- Someone should do something

652
00:38:21,307 --> 00:38:23,017
- to hurt them where they live.
- What?

653
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:26,273
Someone should rob the office.
That's what I'm saying.

654
00:38:26,356 --> 00:38:29,819
If we were that kind of guy
to hold up the joint and trash it,

655
00:38:29,861 --> 00:38:32,949
it looks like robbery,
we take the leads out of the files

656
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,951
and we go to Jerry Graff.

657
00:38:34,992 --> 00:38:38,832
And we take the fucking
Glengarry leads! Huh?

658
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,924
Yeah, Mr. Nyborg? Ah, Mr. Nyborg,
Sheldon Levene.

659
00:38:45,007 --> 00:38:47,594
I was speaking to your wife earlier.
That's right.

660
00:38:47,678 --> 00:38:51,308
I'd like to speak to you
about awarding you your prize.

661
00:38:51,391 --> 00:38:53,394
We're coming to the end
of our fiscal year,

662
00:38:53,478 --> 00:38:56,148
I'd really like to get it
off the books before--

663
00:38:56,232 --> 00:38:59,235
yes, the prize
for Consolidated Properties.

664
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:01,823
The information you requested
on Rio Rancho.

665
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:05,119
Now, I'm in town only for--
well, let me see.

666
00:39:05,161 --> 00:39:08,165
I suppose I could
swing by tonight. Yes. Uh-huh.

667
00:39:08,207 --> 00:39:10,794
When do you think
it might be more convenient?

668
00:39:10,834 --> 00:39:13,464
As I said,
I could swing by tonight--

669
00:39:13,506 --> 00:39:16,009
well, of course,
you speak to your wife.

670
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:18,012
Grace, I'm gonna need

671
00:39:18,095 --> 00:39:20,640
a first-class seat,
passport, 10,000 in cash,

672
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:22,978
put that with the negotiable
papers, if you would.

673
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:27,275
And put me
on the telex hookup-- yes?

674
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,822
Well, when do you think
Mrs. Nyborg might be back?

675
00:39:31,364 --> 00:39:34,327
All train compartments
smell vaguely of shit.

676
00:39:34,411 --> 00:39:37,623
It gets so you don't
mind it.

677
00:39:37,707 --> 00:39:40,835
That's the worst thing
that I can confess.

678
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:43,506
You know how long it took me
to get there? A long time.

679
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:49,724
When you die you're gonna regret
the things you don't do.

680
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:52,852
You think you're queer?
I'm gonna tell you something.

681
00:39:52,936 --> 00:39:56,399
We're all queer.
You think you're a thief? So what?

682
00:39:56,441 --> 00:39:59,029
You get befuddled
by a middle-class morality?

683
00:39:59,112 --> 00:40:01,073
Get shut of it.
Shut it out.

684
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:05,204
You cheat on your wife,
you did it. Live with it.

685
00:40:05,287 --> 00:40:08,541
You fuck little girls,
so be it.

686
00:40:08,625 --> 00:40:12,381
There's an absolute morality?
Maybe.

687
00:40:12,464 --> 00:40:15,092
And then what?

688
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:18,722
If you think there is,
go ahead, be that thing.

689
00:40:18,931 --> 00:40:21,728
Bad people go to hell?
I don't think so.

690
00:40:21,811 --> 00:40:23,772
You think that,
act that way.

691
00:40:23,813 --> 00:40:30,239
A hell exists on earth?
Yes. I won't live in it.

692
00:40:30,281 --> 00:40:32,284
That's me.

693
00:40:36,957 --> 00:40:40,837
Did you ever take a dump, made you
feel like you slept for 12 hours?

694
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,549
- Did I...?
- Yes.

695
00:40:43,632 --> 00:40:47,138
- I don't know.
- Or a piss?

696
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:54,481
Great meals fade
in reflection.

697
00:40:54,564 --> 00:40:57,236
Everything else gains.
Do you know why?

698
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:00,699
'Cause it's only food.
This shit we put in us,

699
00:41:00,782 --> 00:41:03,202
keeps us going--
it's only food.

700
00:41:04,454 --> 00:41:06,748
The great fucks
you may have had,

701
00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:08,794
what do you remember
about them?

702
00:41:08,836 --> 00:41:12,924
- What do I remember?
- Yeah.

703
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,429
I don't know.
For me,

704
00:41:16,513 --> 00:41:19,977
I'm saying what it is,
it's probably not the orgasm.

705
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:25,442
Some broad's forearm
on your neck,

706
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:29,990
something her eyes did.
There was this sound she made.

707
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:33,954
Or it's me in the--
I'm telling you--

708
00:41:34,037 --> 00:41:38,001
I'm in bed the next day,
she brought me caf au lait,

709
00:41:38,042 --> 00:41:41,505
gives me a cigarette,
my balls feel like concrete.

710
00:41:41,547 --> 00:41:43,093
Eh?

711
00:41:45,178 --> 00:41:47,514
What I'm saying,
what is our life?

712
00:41:49,225 --> 00:41:52,938
Our life is looking forward
or it's looking back.

713
00:41:53,022 --> 00:41:56,819
That's it.
That's our life.

714
00:41:56,903 --> 00:41:59,489
Where's the moment?

715
00:42:04,037 --> 00:42:07,001
And what is it
we're so afraid of?

716
00:42:07,043 --> 00:42:08,961
Loss. What else?

717
00:42:09,045 --> 00:42:14,177
The bank closes, we get sick,
my wife died on a plane?

718
00:42:15,637 --> 00:42:18,851
The stock market collapsed?
What of these things happen?

719
00:42:18,893 --> 00:42:22,022
None of them.
We worry anyway. Why?

720
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,359
What could we get
for them?

721
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:28,198
- For them?
- For the leads.

722
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:30,241
What could we get
for the leads?

723
00:42:30,325 --> 00:42:34,706
I don't know. 10 bucks a throw.
15 maybe. I don't know.

724
00:42:36,249 --> 00:42:38,920
For the leads, you're saying?
Say somebody took them,

725
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:42,134
- went to Jerry Graff?
- Yeah. How many leads do we have?

726
00:42:42,217 --> 00:42:43,511
The Glengarry?
The premium leads?

727
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,806
I've got to think they've got 500.
Say 500 leads.

728
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:50,144
You're saying a fella could take
those leads and sell them to Graff?

729
00:42:50,228 --> 00:42:52,481
The leads to Graff.
Yes. I was saying-- yeah.

730
00:42:52,565 --> 00:42:55,152
A guy could take--
like anything else, it seems to me,

731
00:42:55,235 --> 00:42:57,738
that is negotiable,
a guy could sell them.

732
00:42:57,822 --> 00:43:01,201
- How do you know he'd buy them?
- Because I worked for him.

733
00:43:01,285 --> 00:43:04,999
- You didn't talk to him?
- No. What do you mean?

734
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,168
- Did I talk to him about this?
- Yeah.

735
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:09,546
Are you just talking about this,
or are we just talking about it?

736
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:12,051
- Just speaking about it.
- Speaking about it as an idea?

737
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:14,220
- Yes.
- We're not actually talking about it.

738
00:43:14,262 --> 00:43:17,058
- No.
- Talking about it as a robbery.

739
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,895
As a robbery? No.

740
00:43:22,315 --> 00:43:24,568
- Well...
- Hey.

741
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:27,406
So all this--
you didn't actually call Graff?

742
00:43:27,489 --> 00:43:29,951
- You didn't talk to him?
- Not actually, no.

743
00:43:29,993 --> 00:43:32,246
- You didn't?
- No, not actually.

744
00:43:32,329 --> 00:43:33,915
- Did you?
- What did I say?

745
00:43:33,998 --> 00:43:35,792
- What did you say?
- I said, "Not actually."

746
00:43:35,876 --> 00:43:38,046
Fuck you care, George?
We're just talking.

747
00:43:38,129 --> 00:43:39,423
- We are?
- Yes.

748
00:43:39,464 --> 00:43:42,886
- Because it's a crime.
- Robbery. That's right.

749
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:46,599
It is a crime.

750
00:43:49,187 --> 00:43:52,108
- It's also very safe.
- You're actually talking about this.

751
00:43:52,149 --> 00:43:54,944
- That's right.
- You're going to steal the leads.

752
00:43:54,986 --> 00:43:56,447
- Have I said that?
- Are you?

753
00:43:56,488 --> 00:43:58,283
- Did I say that?
- Did you talk to Graff?

754
00:43:58,365 --> 00:43:59,951
- What did I say?
- What did he say?

755
00:44:00,034 --> 00:44:01,829
What did he say?

756
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,128
He'd buy them.

757
00:44:16,016 --> 00:44:18,143
You're gonna steal--

758
00:44:18,227 --> 00:44:21,398
you're gonna steal the Glengarry
leads and sell them to Graff?

759
00:44:21,481 --> 00:44:24,487
- Yes.
- What's he gonna pay?

760
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:27,782
He figures there's 500 leads,
let's say 10 bucks apiece,

761
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:31,454
- that's $2,500 each.
- Each?

762
00:44:31,538 --> 00:44:33,498
- "Each"?
- That's right, George.

763
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,002
- You're saying me?
- No, you and me.

764
00:44:36,044 --> 00:44:40,300
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm saying. $2,500 apiece.

765
00:44:40,383 --> 00:44:42,679
You and me for one night's work,
and a job with Graff

766
00:44:42,762 --> 00:44:45,515
- working the premium leads.
- A job with Graff?

767
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,977
- Is that what I said?
- He'd give me a job?

768
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:50,148
He could take you on.
Yes.

769
00:45:12,888 --> 00:45:14,349
Hello?

770
00:45:14,432 --> 00:45:16,852
I was dialing the direct line
to my daughter's room.

771
00:45:16,894 --> 00:45:19,646
Sheldon Levene.
She's in--

772
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:24,279
well, yeah, I'm sure she's asleep.
But-- where's the duty nurse?

773
00:45:25,572 --> 00:45:28,869
They canceled her--
well, let me talk--

774
00:45:28,952 --> 00:45:30,954
who am I speaking to?

775
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:37,005
I'll have the money there
tomorrow.

776
00:45:37,589 --> 00:45:39,550
It's a big decision,
George.

777
00:45:39,634 --> 00:45:43,013
At times a guy
has got to make one.

778
00:45:43,097 --> 00:45:45,184
It's a big decision
and it's a big reward.

779
00:45:45,267 --> 00:45:48,563
$2,500 and a job, it's a big reward
for one night's work.

780
00:45:48,647 --> 00:45:50,733
Yes.

781
00:45:50,816 --> 00:45:53,278
Sometimes a guy...

782
00:45:53,361 --> 00:45:55,739
sometimes, a man
if he wants a reward--

783
00:45:55,781 --> 00:45:58,369
That's absolutely right.

784
00:45:58,452 --> 00:46:00,413
He'll do one thing,
one thing on one night.

785
00:46:00,497 --> 00:46:05,086
That's absolutely right.
The thing is, it's got to be tonight.

786
00:46:05,127 --> 00:46:06,212
What?

787
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,257
What, what?
The leads ain't going to leave?

788
00:46:08,341 --> 00:46:10,553
They bring those leads up,
wave them under your nose,

789
00:46:10,636 --> 00:46:12,763
tomorrow they take them downtown,
parcel them out.

790
00:46:12,847 --> 00:46:15,601
A guy wants those leads,
he's gonna have to get them tonight.

791
00:46:15,684 --> 00:46:18,646
Tonight is the thing.
Talk about a chance.

792
00:46:18,688 --> 00:46:20,441
It's when a chance
presents itself.

793
00:46:20,483 --> 00:46:22,110
You got to go
in there tonight.

794
00:46:22,194 --> 00:46:23,529
- You.
- I'm sorry?

795
00:46:23,613 --> 00:46:25,282
- You.
- Me?

796
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,409
You have to go in.
You have to get the leads.

797
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,954
- I do?
- It's not something for nothing.

798
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:33,752
I took you in on this.
You have to go. It's your thing.

799
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:36,005
I've made a deal with Graff.
I can't go in.

800
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:39,342
I've spoken out on this too much.
I've got a big mouth.

801
00:46:39,426 --> 00:46:42,430
"The fucking leads," et cetera,
"the tight-ass company," blah, blah.

802
00:46:42,514 --> 00:46:45,477
- They'll know when you go to Graff.
- What will they know?

803
00:46:45,518 --> 00:46:47,771
That I stole the leads?
I didn't steal the leads.

804
00:46:47,855 --> 00:46:50,608
I'm gonna go to the movies.
Then I'm gonna have a late drink

805
00:46:50,692 --> 00:46:52,861
- at the Como Inn with a friend.
- Dave.

806
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:54,239
Yes?

807
00:46:54,322 --> 00:46:56,409
You want me to break into the office
tonight and steal the leads?

808
00:46:56,492 --> 00:46:57,744
- Yes.
- No.

809
00:46:57,828 --> 00:46:59,413
- Oh, yes, George.
- What does that mean?

810
00:46:59,497 --> 00:47:03,919
Listen to this. I have an alibi.
I'm going to the Como Inn.

811
00:47:04,002 --> 00:47:06,757
Why? Why?
The place gets robbed,

812
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,302
they're going to come looking for me.
Why? Because I probably did it.

813
00:47:09,343 --> 00:47:11,805
Let me ask you this--
are you going to turn me in?

814
00:47:11,847 --> 00:47:13,683
What if you don't get caught?

815
00:47:13,766 --> 00:47:15,268
They come to you,
are you going to turn me in?

816
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:17,354
- Why would they come to me?
- They're going to come to everybody.

817
00:47:17,438 --> 00:47:19,191
- Why would I do it?
- You wouldn't, George.

818
00:47:19,275 --> 00:47:21,277
That's why I'm talking to you now.
They come to you,

819
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,155
- are you going to turn me in?
- No.

820
00:47:23,196 --> 00:47:24,865
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

821
00:47:24,907 --> 00:47:29,956
Uh-huh. George...
when they come to me,

822
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,668
if I have to go in there,
and if I get caught--

823
00:47:32,752 --> 00:47:35,589
- they come to me...
- You don't have to go in.

824
00:47:35,672 --> 00:47:37,508
I have to go in, see?
That's something I have to do.

825
00:47:37,591 --> 00:47:39,678
- Why?
- Why?

826
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,348
Are you going to give me $7,500?

827
00:47:41,389 --> 00:47:43,642
75? I thought we were
splitting five grand.

828
00:47:43,726 --> 00:47:46,688
I lied, all right? Your end is 25,
my end is my own concern.

829
00:47:46,771 --> 00:47:49,734
Now, stick with me here.
If they come to me,

830
00:47:49,817 --> 00:47:52,487
I'm caught, they're going to ask me
who were accomplices.

831
00:47:52,571 --> 00:47:54,199
- Me.
- Absolutely.

832
00:47:54,283 --> 00:47:55,575
That's ridiculous.

833
00:47:55,617 --> 00:47:57,495
To the law, you're
an accessory before the fact.

834
00:47:57,537 --> 00:48:00,457
- I didn't ask to be.
- Tough luck, because you are.

835
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,169
- Because you told me about it?
- That's right.

836
00:48:03,252 --> 00:48:05,756
Why are you doing this
to me, Dave?

837
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,469
Why are you talking this way to me?
I don't understand.

838
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,764
- Why are you doing this at all?
- None of your fucking business.

839
00:48:11,848 --> 00:48:13,726
Just in or out?
You tell me.

840
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:15,353
You're out,
you take the consequences.

841
00:48:15,436 --> 00:48:17,357
- I do?
- That's right.

842
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,400
- And why is that?
- Because you listened.

843
00:48:20,069 --> 00:48:21,487
Well, when will
Mrs. Nyborg be back?

844
00:48:21,571 --> 00:48:24,157
You know, I hate to keep
calling you this late, Bruce,

845
00:48:24,241 --> 00:48:28,372
but I feel a responsibility,
I must say. When you have--

846
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:33,504
You know, they say,
"You don't buy it, you rent it."

847
00:48:33,588 --> 00:48:35,882
- Huh?
- The thing.

848
00:48:35,965 --> 00:48:40,889
You really...
what do you keep?

849
00:48:40,931 --> 00:48:43,727
I mean, you don't keep
anything, really.

850
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:46,564
- No.
- Security.

851
00:48:46,647 --> 00:48:49,233
Things. Things.

852
00:48:49,317 --> 00:48:51,697
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

853
00:48:51,779 --> 00:48:56,369
It's just... you try
to stave off insecurity.

854
00:48:56,453 --> 00:48:57,871
You can't do it.

855
00:48:58,289 --> 00:49:00,374
- No.
- No. That's what I'm telling you.

856
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:05,716
Stocks, bonds, objects of art,
real estate, what are they?

857
00:49:05,799 --> 00:49:09,262
An opportunity.
To what? To make money?

858
00:49:09,304 --> 00:49:13,267
Perhaps. To lose money?
Perhaps.

859
00:49:13,309 --> 00:49:16,815
To indulge and to learn
about ourselves? Perhaps.

860
00:49:16,898 --> 00:49:19,987
So fucking what?
What is it? They're an opportunity.

861
00:49:20,069 --> 00:49:22,990
That's all they are.
They're an event.

862
00:49:23,074 --> 00:49:26,746
A guy comes to you,
you make a call. You send in a card,

863
00:49:26,788 --> 00:49:29,583
I have these properties
I would like for you to see.

864
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:32,671
What does this mean?
What do you want it to mean?

865
00:49:32,754 --> 00:49:34,882
You see what I'm saying?

866
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:39,931
Things happen to you.

867
00:49:41,183 --> 00:49:43,812
Glad I met you.

868
00:49:43,895 --> 00:49:45,606
I'm glad I met you,
James.

869
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:50,363
I want to show you
something.

870
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:52,949
It may mean something to you,
it may not.

871
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:55,870
I don't know.
I don't know anymore.

872
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:01,712
What is that?
Florida.

873
00:50:01,796 --> 00:50:04,632
Glengarry Highlands.
Florida.

874
00:50:04,674 --> 00:50:07,678
Bullshit.
And maybe that's true.

875
00:50:07,762 --> 00:50:10,891
And that's what I said.

876
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:13,479
But look at this.

877
00:50:13,562 --> 00:50:17,985
What is this?
This is a piece of land.

878
00:50:18,027 --> 00:50:20,488
Listen to what I'm going
to tell you now.

879
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:50,656
- What happened?
- Where do you work?

880
00:50:50,739 --> 00:50:53,325
I work, yes.
I work here.

881
00:50:53,409 --> 00:50:55,870
- What is it? What happened?
- Robbery.

882
00:51:02,255 --> 00:51:06,344
Williamson. Williamson,
did they get the contracts?

883
00:51:09,056 --> 00:51:11,435
All right, tell me.
Now. Tell me.

884
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:13,354
- They stole the contracts?
- Excuse me, sir.

885
00:51:13,396 --> 00:51:14,814
- Did they get my contract?
- Excuse me, fella.

886
00:51:14,898 --> 00:51:16,108
- Did they?
- Would you excuse us?

887
00:51:16,192 --> 00:51:18,319
Don't fuck with me, fella.
I'm talking about a Cadillac car

888
00:51:18,403 --> 00:51:21,031
- that you owe me.
- They didn't get your contract.

889
00:51:21,073 --> 00:51:23,452
- I filed it before I left.
- They didn't get my contracts?

890
00:51:23,535 --> 00:51:25,455
They got-- excuse me.

891
00:51:25,538 --> 00:51:27,540
Fuck.

892
00:51:27,624 --> 00:51:30,378
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Williamson!

893
00:51:30,461 --> 00:51:33,383
- Williamson, open the fucking door.
- Who are you?

894
00:51:33,425 --> 00:51:35,552
- They didn't get the contracts.
- Did they?

895
00:51:35,636 --> 00:51:38,181
They got-- listen to me.
They got some of them.

896
00:51:38,265 --> 00:51:40,893
- Some of them?
- Who told you?

897
00:51:40,977 --> 00:51:44,314
Who told me?
Who told me we had a robbery?

898
00:51:44,398 --> 00:51:46,068
We got a fucking board
up on the window.

899
00:51:46,109 --> 00:51:50,574
Who is this? Yes.
Yes, I confess. I did it.

900
00:51:50,656 --> 00:51:52,952
Now, leave me
a second here, please.

901
00:51:53,035 --> 00:51:55,706
- Okay, now, talk to me.
- I'm still trying to sort it out.

902
00:51:55,788 --> 00:51:57,918
- So far--
- Talk to me. Talk to me.

903
00:51:58,001 --> 00:52:01,255
They got some
of the contracts?

904
00:52:01,339 --> 00:52:04,551
Lingk. James Lingk,
which I closed last night.

905
00:52:04,635 --> 00:52:06,262
- You closed it last night?
- Yes.

906
00:52:06,345 --> 00:52:10,018
- I filed it. It went down.
- You filed it?

907
00:52:10,102 --> 00:52:12,438
- James Lingk?
- Yes.

908
00:52:12,521 --> 00:52:14,441
- It was sent downtown?
- Yes, all right?

909
00:52:14,482 --> 00:52:16,443
I filed it last night.
It went to the bank.

910
00:52:16,484 --> 00:52:18,862
- It went downtown, all right?
- You filed it?

911
00:52:18,946 --> 00:52:21,575
Then I'm over the fucking top,
you owe me a Cadillac.

912
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:23,871
- I don't--
- I don't want to hear any shit.

913
00:52:23,953 --> 00:52:26,916
I don't give a shit.
Lingk puts me over the top.

914
00:52:26,958 --> 00:52:29,961
You filed it. It went downtown.
Now you owe me the car.

915
00:52:30,045 --> 00:52:33,009
- The robbery makes difficult--
- Fuck you! You owe me the car!

916
00:52:33,092 --> 00:52:35,721
See, 'cause this is how
we keep score, "bubby."

917
00:52:35,804 --> 00:52:38,933
You told me, "Close thus,
and so you get the car."

918
00:52:39,017 --> 00:52:42,020
- I got it.
- Would you excuse us, please?

919
00:52:42,104 --> 00:52:45,026
You hear what I said?
Do you hear what I said?

920
00:52:45,109 --> 00:52:48,614
Hey, pal!
Your excuses are your own!

921
00:52:59,379 --> 00:53:01,924
"Recontact James Lingk.

922
00:53:02,007 --> 00:53:05,805
6:00 p.m. Morton Grove."
Ah-ha.

923
00:53:05,888 --> 00:53:08,392
When do you expect
her in?

924
00:53:08,475 --> 00:53:11,187
This is Ricky Roma
from last night.

925
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:14,358
She'll remember.
Just, just-- wait a minute!

926
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,781
Just to say-- to thank her
for a wonderful time.

927
00:53:17,863 --> 00:53:20,326
Thank you.
I'll call back later. Thank you.

928
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:22,787
They should check
if we're insured.

929
00:53:25,123 --> 00:53:27,794
Uh-huh.

930
00:53:27,877 --> 00:53:30,798
"10:00 p.m., Octavia."

931
00:53:30,882 --> 00:53:33,886
Please don't leave.
I'm going to talk to you.

932
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:36,848
- What's your name?
- Are you talking to me?

933
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:39,894
- That's right.
- My name is Richard Roma.

934
00:53:51,744 --> 00:53:54,373
I-- you know,
they should be insured.

935
00:53:54,457 --> 00:53:56,918
- What do you care?
- Then they wouldn't be so upset.

936
00:53:57,002 --> 00:53:59,505
- Huh?
- They wouldn't be so upset.

937
00:53:59,589 --> 00:54:02,217
- Mitch and Murray.
- Yeah, you're right.

938
00:54:02,259 --> 00:54:04,095
That's right.
How are you?

939
00:54:04,179 --> 00:54:06,390
I'm fine.

940
00:54:06,474 --> 00:54:08,935
You mean the board?
You mean on the board?

941
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:13,900
Yes. Okay.
The board.

942
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,488
I'm fucked on the board.
I can't--

943
00:54:18,782 --> 00:54:21,369
My mind must be other places,
'cause I can't--

944
00:54:21,453 --> 00:54:23,872
What?
You can't do what?

945
00:54:23,914 --> 00:54:26,710
- I can't close them.
- Well, they're old.

946
00:54:26,794 --> 00:54:30,466
Look, look at this shit
they're giving you. Huh?

947
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:32,760
- Yes, they are old.
- They're ancient.

948
00:54:32,844 --> 00:54:35,306
"Clear Meadows."
This shit's dead.

949
00:54:35,389 --> 00:54:36,724
- It is dead.
- Waste of time.

950
00:54:36,807 --> 00:54:41,273
- Yes. I'm no fucking good.
- Hey, fuck that shit, George.

951
00:54:41,356 --> 00:54:43,609
You had a bad month.
You're a good man.

952
00:54:43,692 --> 00:54:45,445
- I am?
- Yeah, you had a bad streak.

953
00:54:45,528 --> 00:54:49,284
Look at this. 15 units, Mountain View,
the fucking things get stolen.

954
00:54:49,367 --> 00:54:52,997
- He said he filed--
- He filed the big one.

955
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:55,251
He filed the guy from the bar
that I closed last night.

956
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:57,796
All the little ones,
I got to go back.

957
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:02,803
Can you believe this?
I got to go back and close again.

958
00:55:02,887 --> 00:55:05,474
I mean, talk about
a fucking beat

959
00:55:05,557 --> 00:55:09,145
that would sap anyone's-- wait,
wait, wait. Where are the phones?

960
00:55:09,228 --> 00:55:12,065
- They stole--
- They stole...?

961
00:55:12,149 --> 00:55:14,653
- What kind of an outfit is it...
- They stole the phones.

962
00:55:14,737 --> 00:55:17,491
...when criminals come and they take--
they steal the phones?

963
00:55:17,574 --> 00:55:19,785
They stole the leads.
They stole the phones,

964
00:55:19,827 --> 00:55:22,455
they stole-- aw, Christ.

965
00:55:22,539 --> 00:55:26,796
What am I going
to do this month? Shit.

966
00:55:26,837 --> 00:55:28,839
You think they're going to catch--
where are you going?

967
00:55:28,881 --> 00:55:31,051
Down the street.

968
00:55:32,511 --> 00:55:37,060
- Where are you going?
- To the-- what do you fucking care?

969
00:55:37,144 --> 00:55:41,566
- Aren't you going out today?
- With what, John? With what?

970
00:55:41,649 --> 00:55:44,820
Well, answer me.
They stole the Glengarry leads.

971
00:55:44,904 --> 00:55:48,368
- They stole Rio Rancho.
- I have stuff from last year's file.

972
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:51,664
Oh, oh, oh.
Your "nostalgia" file.

973
00:55:51,747 --> 00:55:54,500
Oh, great. That's great,
'cause I don't...

974
00:55:54,542 --> 00:55:56,796
- Do you want to go out today?
- I don't have to eat this month.

975
00:55:56,879 --> 00:55:59,466
Great.
Give them to me.

976
00:55:59,551 --> 00:56:02,972
Bring them.
Come on.

977
00:56:04,348 --> 00:56:07,978
Fucking Mitch and Murray
are going to shit a--

978
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:11,192
What am I going
to do all month?

979
00:56:11,275 --> 00:56:13,569
See, the thing
of it is,

980
00:56:13,653 --> 00:56:16,114
is were the leads insured?
You think?

981
00:56:16,198 --> 00:56:19,119
- What?
- Were the leads insured?

982
00:56:19,203 --> 00:56:21,539
I don't know, why?

983
00:56:21,622 --> 00:56:23,501
'Cause if they weren't,
I know Mitch and Murray...

984
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:25,962
- What?
- They'll be upset.

985
00:56:26,046 --> 00:56:28,507
That's right.

986
00:56:28,591 --> 00:56:30,802
You're right.

987
00:56:32,054 --> 00:56:34,558
He said we're all going
to have to talk to the guy.

988
00:56:34,642 --> 00:56:36,185
- To...
- The cop.

989
00:56:36,269 --> 00:56:38,312
Great. We have to talk
to the cop.

990
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:42,068
- Another waste of time.
- A waste of time? Why?

991
00:56:42,151 --> 00:56:44,070
Why? 'Cause they're not going
to find the guy.

992
00:56:44,153 --> 00:56:48,035
- The cops?
- Yes, the cops. No.

993
00:56:48,077 --> 00:56:49,746
The cops aren't going
to find the guy?

994
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:51,582
- Nope.
- Why do you think so?

995
00:56:51,665 --> 00:56:53,167
Why? Because they are stupid.
Where were you last night?

996
00:56:55,419 --> 00:56:57,757
- Where were you?
- Where was I?

997
00:56:57,798 --> 00:56:58,883
- Yeah.
- I was at home.

998
00:56:58,925 --> 00:57:00,052
- Where were you?
- At home.

999
00:57:00,094 --> 00:57:01,971
See? Were you the guy
who broke in?

1000
00:57:02,054 --> 00:57:03,097
- Was I?
- Yes.

1001
00:57:03,181 --> 00:57:05,393
- No.
- Then don't sweat it. You know why?

1002
00:57:05,434 --> 00:57:07,562
- No.
- You have nothing to hide.

1003
00:57:07,645 --> 00:57:10,358
- When I talk to police, I get nervous.
- Yes, you know who doesn't?

1004
00:57:10,442 --> 00:57:12,987
- No. Who?
- Thieves.

1005
00:57:12,778 --> 00:57:14,739
I don't know
what I'm going to tell them.

1006
00:57:14,781 --> 00:57:17,117
The truth.
Always tell them the truth.

1007
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:19,203
It's the easiest thing
to remember.

1008
00:57:19,788 --> 00:57:22,792
Whoa, whoa!
"Patel"?

1009
00:57:22,876 --> 00:57:25,337
"Ravidam Patel"?

1010
00:57:25,421 --> 00:57:27,215
How am I going to make a living
on these deadbeats?

1011
00:57:27,298 --> 00:57:29,259
- Where did you get this from, a morgue?
- Look, I'm--

1012
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:32,473
Come on. What's the point?
What's the fucking point?

1013
00:57:32,556 --> 00:57:35,434
I got to argue with you,
I got to knock heads with the cops,

1014
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:37,312
I'm busting my balls
to sell your dirt

1015
00:57:37,396 --> 00:57:40,191
to deadbeats--
money in the mattress.

1016
00:57:40,275 --> 00:57:42,778
I come back, you can't even
keep the contracts safe.

1017
00:57:42,862 --> 00:57:45,032
I got to go out--
fuck this shit.

1018
00:57:45,115 --> 00:57:46,909
I'm going to go out
and re-close last week's stuff.

1019
00:57:46,993 --> 00:57:49,038
No, the word from Murray
is leave them alone.

1020
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,332
If he needs a new sig,
he'll go out himself.

1021
00:57:51,374 --> 00:57:54,377
- Murray's gonna go out?
- He'll be "president of the company

1022
00:57:54,419 --> 00:57:56,757
just in from out of town,"
all right?

1023
00:57:58,301 --> 00:58:01,304
Okay, okay, okay.
Give me this shit.

1024
00:58:01,388 --> 00:58:03,849
- I'm giving you three leads.
- Three? I count two.

1025
00:58:03,891 --> 00:58:06,103
- There's three leads there.
- Patel? Fuck you.

1026
00:58:06,187 --> 00:58:09,191
Fucking Shiva handed
this guy a million dollars,

1027
00:58:09,275 --> 00:58:11,485
told him, "Sign the deal,"
he wouldn't sign.

1028
00:58:11,569 --> 00:58:14,323
And the god Vishnu, too,
into the bargain. Fuck you.

1029
00:58:14,406 --> 00:58:17,244
You know your business, I know mine.
Your business is being an asshole.

1030
00:58:17,326 --> 00:58:19,914
If I find out whose fucking cousin
you are, I'm gonna go to him

1031
00:58:19,998 --> 00:58:24,211
and figure out a way
to have your ass-- fuck you!

1032
00:58:24,295 --> 00:58:26,924
I'm waiting
for the new leads.

1033
00:58:30,596 --> 00:58:33,725
Get the chalk!
Hey! Get the chalk!

1034
00:58:33,767 --> 00:58:35,645
Get the--
I did it-- I closed 'em.

1035
00:58:35,728 --> 00:58:37,481
I closed the cocksucker.
Get the chalk.

1036
00:58:37,564 --> 00:58:41,069
Put me on the board, John.
Put me on the Cadillac board!

1037
00:58:41,152 --> 00:58:43,864
Williamson,
pick up the fucking chalk.

1038
00:58:43,948 --> 00:58:47,996
- Rick-- eight units, Mountain View.
- You sold eight Mountain View?

1039
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,415
You bet your ass!
Who wants to go to lunch?

1040
00:58:50,457 --> 00:58:52,584
Who wants to go to lunch--
I'm buying.

1041
00:58:52,668 --> 00:58:56,383
Williamson-- $82,000,
12 grand in my commission.

1042
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:58,719
On deadbeat
magazine subscription leads.

1043
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:01,431
- Who?
- Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.

1044
00:59:01,473 --> 00:59:03,892
Read it.
What the hell happened here?

1045
00:59:03,976 --> 00:59:06,104
Fuck! I had them
on River Glen.

1046
00:59:06,188 --> 00:59:07,940
- What happened?
- Somebody broke in.

1047
00:59:08,024 --> 00:59:10,194
- Eight units!
- Yeah.

1048
00:59:10,277 --> 00:59:13,155
- Shelly!
- Big deal-- I broke a bad streak.

1049
00:59:13,239 --> 00:59:15,451
Shelly "The Machine" Levene.
That's great.

1050
00:59:15,533 --> 00:59:17,454
Thank you, George.
Hey--

1051
00:59:17,537 --> 00:59:19,957
- grab the phone, call Mitch.
- They took the phones.

1052
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:21,626
- Huh?
- Aaronow?

1053
00:59:21,668 --> 00:59:23,963
They took the leads,
the cash, the contracts.

1054
00:59:24,005 --> 00:59:25,840
- We had a robbery.
- When?

1055
00:59:25,923 --> 00:59:28,636
- Last night, this morning.
- They took the leads?

1056
00:59:31,432 --> 00:59:33,435
Fucking asshole.

1057
00:59:33,518 --> 00:59:35,646
What? They beat you
with a rubber bat?

1058
00:59:35,729 --> 00:59:38,066
Cop couldn't find his dick
with two hands and a map.

1059
00:59:38,149 --> 00:59:40,486
Anybody who talks to this asshole
is a fucking asshole.

1060
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:42,656
- You gonna turn state's?
- Fuck you, Ricky.

1061
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:45,618
I ain't going out today.
I'm going home.

1062
00:59:45,702 --> 00:59:47,997
I'm going home because nothing's
accomplished here.

1063
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,124
- Anybody talks to this guy--
- Guess what "The Machine" did.

1064
00:59:50,208 --> 00:59:53,505
- Fuck "The Machine."
- Mountain View, eight units.

1065
00:59:53,588 --> 00:59:56,675
Cop's got no right to talk to me
that way. I did not rob the place.

1066
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:59,889
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah, he closed the deal.

1067
00:59:59,972 --> 01:00:02,308
Eight units,
Mountain View.

1068
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:04,896
- You did that?
- Yeah.

1069
01:00:06,105 --> 01:00:08,234
- Fuck you.
- Guess who?

1070
01:00:08,317 --> 01:00:09,903
- When?
- Just now.

1071
01:00:09,986 --> 01:00:12,280
- Guess who?
- You just-- this morning?

1072
01:00:12,364 --> 01:00:14,826
Harriett
and blah blah Nyborg.

1073
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:18,164
- You did that?
- Yeah-- $82,000.

1074
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:22,796
- Those fucking deadbeats.
- My ass. I told 'em-- listen to this.

1075
01:00:22,879 --> 01:00:26,050
- I don't want to hear your war stories.
- Fuck you, Dave.

1076
01:00:26,133 --> 01:00:28,554
I said, "You have to believe
in yourself."

1077
01:00:28,638 --> 01:00:31,016
Give me a lead.
I'm going out. I'm getting out.

1078
01:00:31,099 --> 01:00:35,938
- Fuck the leads. I'm going home.
- "Fuck me, Bruce.

1079
01:00:36,022 --> 01:00:37,567
- You have to believe in yourself."
- We haven't got a lead.

1080
01:00:37,649 --> 01:00:40,113
- Why not?
- They took 'em.

1081
01:00:40,196 --> 01:00:42,782
They're fucking garbage, any case.
The whole goddamn--

1082
01:00:42,865 --> 01:00:46,203
"You look around, you say,
'This one has so-and-so. I got nothing.

1083
01:00:46,245 --> 01:00:48,749
But why? Why don't I get
the opportunities?"'

1084
01:00:48,832 --> 01:00:51,419
- Did they steal the contracts?
- What the fuck do you care?

1085
01:00:51,503 --> 01:00:53,297
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

1086
01:00:53,381 --> 01:00:55,384
Will you shut up?
I'm telling him something.

1087
01:00:57,344 --> 01:00:59,014
Could we get
some coffee?

1088
01:00:59,096 --> 01:01:01,226
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

1089
01:01:03,229 --> 01:01:04,396
Uh-huh.

1090
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,399
Anybody's going out,
I could use some coffee.

1091
01:01:08,777 --> 01:01:12,240
- "You do get the opportunity."
- Fuck is that supposed to mean?

1092
01:01:12,324 --> 01:01:14,619
"You do get the opportunities.
You get 'em as I get 'em,

1093
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,415
- as everybody gets 'em."
- I don't care they stole the contracts?

1094
01:01:17,498 --> 01:01:19,625
I got 'em in the kitchen,
eating their crumb cake--

1095
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:21,921
- What does that mean?
- It means, Dave,

1096
01:01:22,004 --> 01:01:24,258
You haven't closed
a good one in a month.

1097
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,136
None of my business,
you want to push me to answer you.

1098
01:01:26,219 --> 01:01:29,264
So you haven't got a contract
to get stolen and so forth.

1099
01:01:29,348 --> 01:01:32,185
You got a mean streak in you.
Shut the fuck up!

1100
01:01:32,269 --> 01:01:35,439
Ricky, you got a mean streak in you,
and what are you babbling about?

1101
01:01:35,523 --> 01:01:37,402
You bring that shit up--
on my volume?

1102
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:40,614
If you were on a bad one and I
brought it up to you, you'd harbor it.

1103
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:43,159
You'd harbor it a long while
and you'd be right.

1104
01:01:43,243 --> 01:01:45,620
- Who said "Fuck 'The Machine"'?
- Fuck "The Machine"?

1105
01:01:45,662 --> 01:01:48,208
Fuck "The Machine"?
Fuck "The Machine"!

1106
01:01:48,292 --> 01:01:51,629
What is this, courtesy class?
You're fucked, Rick.

1107
01:01:51,713 --> 01:01:54,467
Are you fucking nuts?
You're hot, so you think

1108
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:56,136
- you're the ruler of this place.
- Wait a minute, Dave.

1109
01:01:56,219 --> 01:01:57,930
- Shut up!
- Okay...

1110
01:01:58,013 --> 01:02:00,518
You want to decide who
should be dealt with how, is that it?

1111
01:02:00,601 --> 01:02:03,479
I come into the office today,
I get humiliated by some jag-off cop.

1112
01:02:03,563 --> 01:02:05,441
I get accused of--

1113
01:02:05,524 --> 01:02:09,195
I get shit thrown in my face because
you're top name on the board?

1114
01:02:09,278 --> 01:02:12,117
Is that what I did, Dave--
I humiliated you?

1115
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,747
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- Sitting on top of the world.

1116
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:18,667
Sitting on top of the world--
everything's fucking peach fuzz.

1117
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:21,964
I don't get a moment to spare
for some bust-out humanitarian

1118
01:02:22,046 --> 01:02:23,841
- down on his luck lately?
- Fuck you!

1119
01:02:23,925 --> 01:02:25,719
Fuck you, Dave--
you know you got a big mouth.

1120
01:02:25,803 --> 01:02:29,015
You make a close, this whole place
stinks with your farts for a week--

1121
01:02:29,099 --> 01:02:33,438
how much you just ingested.
Oh, what a big man you are!

1122
01:02:33,521 --> 01:02:36,193
"Let me buy you a pack of gum--
I'll show you how to chew it."

1123
01:02:36,276 --> 01:02:39,238
Your pal closes, and all that comes
out of your mouth is bile.

1124
01:02:39,321 --> 01:02:42,493
How fucked-up you are!

1125
01:02:42,535 --> 01:02:47,417
Who's my pal, Ricky? Hmm?
And what are you?

1126
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,838
What are you, huh,
Bishop Sheen?

1127
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,007
What the fuck are you,
"Mr. Slick"?

1128
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:55,677
What the fuck are you,
"Friend to the working man"?

1129
01:02:55,761 --> 01:02:58,140
Big deal!
Fuck you!

1130
01:03:00,435 --> 01:03:02,688
You got the memory
of a fucking fly!

1131
01:03:04,774 --> 01:03:07,694
I never liked you,
anyway.

1132
01:03:07,778 --> 01:03:09,907
What is this,
your farewell speech?

1133
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:12,369
- I'm going home.
- Your farewell to the troops?

1134
01:03:12,452 --> 01:03:14,287
I'm not going home.
I'm going to Wisconsin.

1135
01:03:14,371 --> 01:03:16,832
- Have a good trip.
- Aw, fuck you!

1136
01:03:17,584 --> 01:03:20,380
Fuck the lot of you!
Fuck you all!

1137
01:03:24,594 --> 01:03:26,388
You were saying?

1138
01:03:26,471 --> 01:03:29,183
Huh?

1139
01:03:29,267 --> 01:03:31,061
Come on.

1140
01:03:31,145 --> 01:03:33,398
Come on-- you got 'em
in the kitchen,

1141
01:03:33,482 --> 01:03:36,110
you're in
your shirtsleeves,

1142
01:03:36,194 --> 01:03:38,488
you got
the stats spread out,

1143
01:03:38,572 --> 01:03:41,826
you can smell it.
Come on, snap out of it.

1144
01:03:41,909 --> 01:03:45,248
- You're eating her crumb cake.
- Oh yeah, I'm eating her crumb cake.

1145
01:03:45,332 --> 01:03:48,460
- How was it?
- From the store.

1146
01:03:48,544 --> 01:03:51,089
- Fuck her.
- "Bruce, Harriett...

1147
01:03:51,172 --> 01:03:55,012
we have to admit to ourselves
that we see that opportunity

1148
01:03:55,096 --> 01:03:58,517
and take it-- and that's it."
Now, we just sit there.

1149
01:03:58,601 --> 01:04:00,395
- I got my pen out.
- "Always Be Closing."

1150
01:04:00,477 --> 01:04:02,982
God, that's what
I've been saying-- the old ways.

1151
01:04:03,064 --> 01:04:06,570
Convert that motherfucker,
sell him, make him sign the check.

1152
01:04:06,653 --> 01:04:08,531
They got their money
in government bonds--

1153
01:04:08,615 --> 01:04:12,203
I said, "Fuck it-- let's go
all the way, the whole route."

1154
01:04:12,286 --> 01:04:16,584
I take it and plat it out-- eight units,
82 grand, and I say to them,

1155
01:04:16,626 --> 01:04:21,758
"This is now. This is that thing
that you have been dreaming of.

1156
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,303
You are going to find
the suitcase on the train.

1157
01:04:24,386 --> 01:04:27,599
The man walks in the room,
that bag is filled with money.

1158
01:04:27,683 --> 01:04:31,229
Harriett, this is it, and Bruce--
I don't want to fuck around with you.

1159
01:04:31,313 --> 01:04:34,484
No, I don't. I don't want
to pussyfoot around.

1160
01:04:34,568 --> 01:04:37,780
You think you got to look back
on this thing? I do, too.

1161
01:04:37,864 --> 01:04:41,328
Now, I'm here to do good
for you and me-- the both of us.

1162
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:44,665
What is the point
of some interim position?

1163
01:04:44,749 --> 01:04:48,336
The only arrangement
I will accept is full investment.

1164
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:51,466
And I mean it, that's it--
all eight units. Period."

1165
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:54,137
Now I got the pen
in my hand, Rick-- hey.

1166
01:04:54,221 --> 01:04:59,060
I turned that contract around--
that's eight units, 82 grand--

1167
01:04:59,144 --> 01:05:03,191
and I said,
"I want you to sign."

1168
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:06,280
I sat there five minutes.

1169
01:05:06,362 --> 01:05:11,786
Then I sat 22 minutes
by that kitchen clock on the wall.

1170
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:14,666
Ricky-- not a word,
not a motion.

1171
01:05:14,707 --> 01:05:17,379
And what am I thinking?
"Is my arm getting tired?"

1172
01:05:17,461 --> 01:05:20,299
No. I did it.
Just like the old days,

1173
01:05:20,382 --> 01:05:22,009
like I used to,
like I was taught.

1174
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:24,179
- I did it.
- Like you taught me.

1175
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:27,308
Nobody ever--
well, if I did, I'm glad.

1176
01:05:27,392 --> 01:05:29,436
No, what I did--
I locked on 'em.

1177
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,148
I locked all on them--
nothing on me-- on them.

1178
01:05:32,232 --> 01:05:35,320
And, oh God, I am holding
my last thought,

1179
01:05:35,403 --> 01:05:38,031
"Now is the time."

1180
01:05:39,116 --> 01:05:42,705
They signed.
It was great.

1181
01:05:42,789 --> 01:05:45,501
It was so fucking great.

1182
01:05:45,585 --> 01:05:49,464
It was like
they wilted all at once.

1183
01:05:49,548 --> 01:05:52,136
- Mmm.
- No gesture, nothing-- just together.

1184
01:05:52,219 --> 01:05:57,309
Honest to God, they both
imperceptibly slumped.

1185
01:05:57,393 --> 01:06:01,023
And then he reached
and he took the pen and he signed,

1186
01:06:01,064 --> 01:06:03,193
passed it to her
and she signed.

1187
01:06:03,276 --> 01:06:05,529
It was solemn--
fucking solemn.

1188
01:06:05,613 --> 01:06:10,619
I let it sit, and then I nodded.
I said, "Harriett, Bruce,"

1189
01:06:10,703 --> 01:06:13,122
then I pointed into the living room
to the sideboard.

1190
01:06:13,206 --> 01:06:15,419
I didn't know there was
a sideboard in there.

1191
01:06:15,502 --> 01:06:17,504
He went over,
he brought us back a drink--

1192
01:06:17,588 --> 01:06:21,051
little shot glasses
with a pretty design in 'em.

1193
01:06:22,678 --> 01:06:26,309
And we just toasted
in silence.

1194
01:06:26,392 --> 01:06:29,855
Great sale, Shelly.

1195
01:06:29,939 --> 01:06:31,941
Great.

1196
01:06:32,024 --> 01:06:34,945
Fuck! Send me out!
Give me leads!

1197
01:06:35,029 --> 01:06:36,030
- Williamson! Send me out!
- Whoa!

1198
01:06:36,781 --> 01:06:38,742
- The leads are coming.
- Get 'em to me.

1199
01:06:38,826 --> 01:06:41,455
I talked to Mitch and Murray
an hour ago. They're coming in.

1200
01:06:41,538 --> 01:06:44,167
- They're a bit upset over this.
- Did you tell 'em my sale?

1201
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,628
How could I tell 'em your sale?
I didn't have a tele--

1202
01:06:46,921 --> 01:06:49,258
I'll tell 'em your sale
when they bring in the leads.

1203
01:06:49,341 --> 01:06:52,262
We had a little-- you closed the deal,
you made a good sale. Fine.

1204
01:06:52,346 --> 01:06:55,224
- Better than a good sale.
- I have a lot of things on my mind.

1205
01:06:55,307 --> 01:06:58,478
They're coming and they're very upset.
I'm trying to make--

1206
01:06:58,562 --> 01:07:01,316
All I'm telling you is, you can tell
them it was a remarkably good sale.

1207
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:04,154
The only thing remarkable
about it is who you made it to.

1208
01:07:04,196 --> 01:07:07,659
- What the fuck does that mean?
- If the sale sticks it'll be a miracle.

1209
01:07:07,742 --> 01:07:10,037
"If the sale sticks"?
Why shouldn't the sale stick?

1210
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:14,126
Oh, fuck you!
You do not know your job.

1211
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:16,045
Do you know that?
A man is his job!

1212
01:07:16,129 --> 01:07:19,133
You are fucked at yours.
You hear what I'm saying to you?

1213
01:07:19,216 --> 01:07:21,303
Your "End of the Month"
fucking boar--

1214
01:07:21,386 --> 01:07:23,180
you do not know how
to run this office.

1215
01:07:23,221 --> 01:07:25,643
You haven't got the sense.
You haven't got the balls.

1216
01:07:25,726 --> 01:07:28,855
Have you ever been on a sit?
Has this cocksucker been on a sit?

1217
01:07:28,939 --> 01:07:31,693
- Did you ever sit--
- If I were you, I would calm down.

1218
01:07:31,734 --> 01:07:33,694
Would you?
What are you gonna do, fire me?

1219
01:07:33,778 --> 01:07:35,698
Oh, oh, Rick, ooh.

1220
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:39,036
- It's not impossible.
- Really? On an $80,000 day?

1221
01:07:39,078 --> 01:07:41,539
- It's not even noon yet.
- You closed 'em today?

1222
01:07:41,623 --> 01:07:44,293
I got up early this morning,
tracked 'em down, and closed it.

1223
01:07:44,377 --> 01:07:47,674
What I'm saying to you
is that things change.

1224
01:07:47,757 --> 01:07:51,053
That's where you fuck up.
You don't know. You can't look back.

1225
01:07:51,137 --> 01:07:55,183
You don't see who's coming.
Maybe it's someone new, huh?

1226
01:07:55,267 --> 01:07:57,436
Maybe it's someone else,
but you don't know--

1227
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,191
you can't look back, because
you don't know your history!

1228
01:08:00,233 --> 01:08:02,611
When we were on Rio Rancho,
who was the top man, huh?

1229
01:08:02,694 --> 01:08:04,614
For what,
two months, three months?

1230
01:08:04,697 --> 01:08:07,660
How about eight months,
for three years in a row!

1231
01:08:07,742 --> 01:08:11,499
Luck-- was that it, John?
Or purloined fucking leads?

1232
01:08:11,582 --> 01:08:13,376
- It was talent!
- Yes.

1233
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:17,006
Door to door.
It's called "cold calling," John.

1234
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:20,469
Shit, I don't even know their name.
They don't want to buy what I've got.

1235
01:08:20,552 --> 01:08:23,223
Soft sell-- we were doing it
before we had a name for it.

1236
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:25,185
- Am I right?
- You're right, you're right.

1237
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:29,106
You wouldn't know, you cock--
he doesn't even know what a streak is.

1238
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:31,568
What the hell are you?

1239
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:34,364
You're a fucking secretary.
Fuck you!

1240
01:08:34,448 --> 01:08:37,827
That's my message to you--
fuck you, and kiss my ass.

1241
01:08:37,911 --> 01:08:41,666
If you don't like that, I go across
the street and speak to Jerry Graff.

1242
01:08:41,749 --> 01:08:43,585
Period. Fuck you.

1243
01:08:43,668 --> 01:08:46,840
Listen to me-- you put me
on that fucking board,

1244
01:08:46,924 --> 01:08:49,386
and I want three
promising leads for today,

1245
01:08:49,469 --> 01:08:52,473
I don't want any bullshit,
and I want 'em close together,

1246
01:08:52,556 --> 01:08:54,726
because I am
going to close them all.

1247
01:08:54,809 --> 01:08:58,023
And that's all I have
to say to you.

1248
01:08:59,358 --> 01:09:02,404
He's right, Williamson.

1249
01:09:04,991 --> 01:09:08,288
I'm sorry, but it's wrong,
and you know whose fault it is?

1250
01:09:08,329 --> 01:09:09,915
Mitch and Murray.

1251
01:09:12,501 --> 01:09:15,255
To hell with him.
Let's get some lunch, huh, Rick?

1252
01:09:15,338 --> 01:09:17,466
The leads won't be
up here till later anyway.

1253
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:20,930
You're a client. I just sold you
five waterfront Glengarry Farms.

1254
01:09:21,014 --> 01:09:23,809
I do this with my hair,
throw me the cue "Kenilworth."

1255
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:26,313
- Which is it?
- Kenilworth.

1256
01:09:26,354 --> 01:09:29,065
I own the property.
My mother owns the property.

1257
01:09:29,149 --> 01:09:30,901
I put her into it.

1258
01:09:30,985 --> 01:09:34,156
You look on the plats
when you go home. You'll see...

1259
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,994
A-3 through 10,
26 through 30.

1260
01:09:37,036 --> 01:09:40,791
- Take your time. If you still feel--
- I won't need more time, Rick.

1261
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:42,961
- I've bought a lot of property.
- I've got to talk to you.

1262
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:45,423
Jim, what are you
doing here?

1263
01:09:45,506 --> 01:09:48,718
Jim Lingk,
D. Ray Morton.

1264
01:09:48,802 --> 01:09:51,848
- I'm glad to meet you.
- I put Jim into Black Creek.

1265
01:09:51,932 --> 01:09:54,811
- Are you acquainted with--
- Black Creek? No.

1266
01:09:54,894 --> 01:09:56,689
- Ooh, in Florida!
- Yes.

1267
01:09:56,772 --> 01:09:59,943
- I meant to speak to you about that.
- We'll do that this weekend.

1268
01:10:00,026 --> 01:10:01,737
My wife suggested
I look into it.

1269
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:04,574
Beautiful rolling land--
I was telling Jim and Jinny.

1270
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:08,038
Ray, I got to tell you something.
You eat in a lot of restaurants?

1271
01:10:08,122 --> 01:10:11,000
I know you do.
Ray is with American Express.

1272
01:10:11,042 --> 01:10:12,919
- Can I tell Jim what you do?
- Sure.

1273
01:10:13,003 --> 01:10:16,466
Ray is the director of all
European sales and services--

1274
01:10:16,549 --> 01:10:19,596
what I'm saying is, you haven't had
a meal until you've tasted--

1275
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:21,473
I was at the Lingks'--

1276
01:10:21,557 --> 01:10:24,018
what was that service feature
you were talking about?

1277
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,771
- Which--
- "Home cooking."

1278
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:28,692
- You had a tag phrase you used?
- "Cooking"...

1279
01:10:28,733 --> 01:10:30,362
"Home cook--"
the monthly interview.

1280
01:10:30,445 --> 01:10:32,614
- The magazine!
- Yes.

1281
01:10:32,698 --> 01:10:35,034
Is that something
I can talk about?

1282
01:10:35,117 --> 01:10:38,330
It won't be out until
the February issue, but go ahead.

1283
01:10:38,413 --> 01:10:40,040
- Are you sure?
- Go ahead.

1284
01:10:40,124 --> 01:10:43,171
Ray was eating at one of his
company men's homes in France.

1285
01:10:43,255 --> 01:10:45,298
- The man is French?
- No, but his wife is.

1286
01:10:45,382 --> 01:10:47,009
His wife.

1287
01:10:47,093 --> 01:10:49,679
Ray, what time
do you have?

1288
01:10:49,763 --> 01:10:52,560
- 12:15.
- I got to get you on the plane.

1289
01:10:52,601 --> 01:10:54,395
- Didn't I say the 2:00?
- No, the 1:00.

1290
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:57,399
Remember the 1:00-- that's why
we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.

1291
01:10:57,482 --> 01:10:59,611
You're right, the 1:00--
let's scoot.

1292
01:10:59,693 --> 01:11:01,822
- A pleasure.
- I got to talk to you.

1293
01:11:01,905 --> 01:11:04,993
I got to run Ray to the airport.
Let's hustle-- John!

1294
01:11:05,077 --> 01:11:08,581
Get on the phone to Pittsburgh,
American Express there, for Mr. Morton.

1295
01:11:08,665 --> 01:11:11,961
Tell them he's on the 1:00.
I'll see you.

1296
01:11:12,044 --> 01:11:14,422
Christ, I'm sorry
you came all the way in.

1297
01:11:14,506 --> 01:11:17,553
I'm running Ray to the airport.
You wait here and--

1298
01:11:17,636 --> 01:11:20,222
no, I can't. I'm meeting your man
at the bank.

1299
01:11:20,306 --> 01:11:24,145
I wish you'd have phoned!
Are you and Jinny going to be home?

1300
01:11:24,228 --> 01:11:25,647
- I don't know.
- Rick?

1301
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:27,233
- What?
- Kenilworth?

1302
01:11:27,317 --> 01:11:29,027
- I'm sorry?
- Kenilworth.

1303
01:11:29,111 --> 01:11:32,032
Oh, God. Excuse me, Ray--
just a minute.

1304
01:11:32,073 --> 01:11:36,620
Jim, I told you who he is-- the senior
vice-president of American Express.

1305
01:11:36,704 --> 01:11:38,875
His family owns 32 per--

1306
01:11:38,959 --> 01:11:42,838
over the past years, I have sold him--
I can't tell you the dollar amount--

1307
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,550
but quite a lot of land.

1308
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:49,097
I promised him five weeks ago that I
would go to the wife's birthday party

1309
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,685
in Kenilworth tonight.
I have to go, you understand?

1310
01:11:51,768 --> 01:11:54,855
They treat me like a member
of the family. I have to go.

1311
01:11:54,939 --> 01:11:59,153
It's funny-- you get a picture
of the corporation-type company man,

1312
01:11:59,236 --> 01:12:01,698
all business--
this guy, I'll tell you.

1313
01:12:01,739 --> 01:12:03,702
We'll go to his house
someday.

1314
01:12:03,743 --> 01:12:07,915
Let me see. Tomorrow.
I'm in L.A.?

1315
01:12:07,999 --> 01:12:10,335
Ah, Monday.

1316
01:12:10,419 --> 01:12:12,755
I'll take you to lunch.
Where would you like to eat?

1317
01:12:12,838 --> 01:12:14,258
- My wife--
- Rick?

1318
01:12:14,341 --> 01:12:17,637
I can't talk now, Jim--
I'll call you tonight. Coming, Ray.

1319
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:20,016
My wife said I have
to cancel the deal.

1320
01:12:21,726 --> 01:12:24,272
That's a common reaction, Jim,
and let me tell you what it is.

1321
01:12:24,355 --> 01:12:27,234
That's why you married her.
One of the reasons is prudence.

1322
01:12:27,276 --> 01:12:30,072
No, it's a sizable investment.
One thinks twice.

1323
01:12:30,113 --> 01:12:35,078
It's also something women have.
Reaction to the size of the investment.

1324
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:37,415
Monday, you invite me
to dinner again--

1325
01:12:37,457 --> 01:12:39,376
- This woman can cook.
- I'm sure she can.

1326
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:42,130
We are going to talk.
I want to tell you something.

1327
01:12:42,214 --> 01:12:45,259
Something about your acreage
I want you to know.

1328
01:12:45,343 --> 01:12:49,099
I can't talk about it here,
I really shouldn't, and by law--

1329
01:12:49,183 --> 01:12:53,521
the man next to you--
bought his lot at 42--

1330
01:12:53,604 --> 01:12:55,607
phoned to say
he already had an offer.

1331
01:12:55,691 --> 01:12:57,360
- Rick.
- I'm coming.

1332
01:12:57,443 --> 01:12:59,906
Ray, what a day.
I'll call you this evening.

1333
01:12:59,989 --> 01:13:03,285
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way in. Monday lunch.

1334
01:13:03,369 --> 01:13:05,079
- We have to go.
- Monday!

1335
01:13:05,163 --> 01:13:08,835
She called the consumer--
the attorney general?

1336
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:11,296
- They said we have three days.
- Who'd she call?

1337
01:13:11,381 --> 01:13:14,468
The attorney ge--
it was some consumer office.

1338
01:13:15,636 --> 01:13:17,972
Why'd she do that, Jim?

1339
01:13:18,014 --> 01:13:19,850
I don't know.

1340
01:13:19,934 --> 01:13:21,768
But they said
we have three days.

1341
01:13:21,852 --> 01:13:24,941
They said
we got three days, yeah.

1342
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:27,027
Three days?

1343
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:31,157
- To... you know.
- No, I don't know.

1344
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,788
- Tell me.
- To change our minds.

1345
01:13:34,871 --> 01:13:37,792
Of course you have--
three days.

1346
01:13:37,876 --> 01:13:40,296
So we can't talk Monday.

1347
01:13:40,337 --> 01:13:42,966
Monday--
you saw my book.

1348
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:45,636
Jim, Jim-- I can't.

1349
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:47,598
You saw my book.
I can't.

1350
01:13:47,681 --> 01:13:49,726
We have to before Monday
to get our money back.

1351
01:13:49,809 --> 01:13:51,811
Three business days,
they mean.

1352
01:13:51,895 --> 01:13:54,315
- Three business days.
- Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

1353
01:13:54,398 --> 01:13:57,652
- I don't understand.
- That's what they are, three business--

1354
01:13:57,737 --> 01:13:59,823
if we wait till Monday,
my time limit runs out.

1355
01:13:59,907 --> 01:14:01,992
- You don't count Saturday.
- I'm not.

1356
01:14:02,076 --> 01:14:04,746
I'm saying you don't include
Saturday in the three days.

1357
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:08,167
- It's not a business day.
- I am not counting it.

1358
01:14:08,251 --> 01:14:12,925
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday--
so it would have elapsed.

1359
01:14:13,009 --> 01:14:14,927
What would have elapsed?

1360
01:14:15,011 --> 01:14:16,763
If we wait till Monday
it would have elapsed!

1361
01:14:16,847 --> 01:14:19,099
- When did you write the check?
- Yesterday.

1362
01:14:19,183 --> 01:14:20,852
- What was yesterday?
- Tuesday.

1363
01:14:20,936 --> 01:14:24,024
- And when was that check cashed?
- I don't know.

1364
01:14:24,108 --> 01:14:26,486
What was the earliest
it could have been cashed?

1365
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:29,907
- I don't know.
- Today.

1366
01:14:29,991 --> 01:14:33,204
Today. Which, in any case,
it was not--

1367
01:14:33,246 --> 01:14:36,374
there was something on the agreement
I wanted to go over with you.

1368
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:38,461
It wasn't cashed?

1369
01:14:38,545 --> 01:14:40,714
I just phoned downtown--
it's on their desk.

1370
01:14:40,797 --> 01:14:42,967
- Rick.
- One moment.

1371
01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:45,846
One point, in fact, of which
I spoke to you of which,

1372
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:47,933
I can't talk to you
about it here.

1373
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:50,311
- Levene!
- Listen to me.

1374
01:14:50,394 --> 01:14:54,358
The statute is for your protection.
I have no complaint with that.

1375
01:14:54,441 --> 01:14:56,695
In fact, I was a member
of the board when we drafted it.

1376
01:14:56,778 --> 01:14:58,740
So quite the opposite.
It says,

1377
01:14:58,781 --> 01:15:01,535
"You can change your mind
three 'working days'

1378
01:15:01,577 --> 01:15:03,455
from the time
the deal was closed."

1379
01:15:03,537 --> 01:15:05,498
- Levene!
- Wait a second!

1380
01:15:05,582 --> 01:15:07,753
Which is not until
the check is cashed!

1381
01:15:07,794 --> 01:15:11,257
I'm through with this "meshugaas."
Nobody should talk to a man that way.

1382
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:13,594
- How are you talking to me that way?
- Levene!

1383
01:15:13,677 --> 01:15:16,597
- How can you talk to me that way?
- I'm gonna flag a cab.

1384
01:15:16,681 --> 01:15:19,603
- I didn't rob--
- Shelly, get in the office.

1385
01:15:19,645 --> 01:15:22,773
"Where were you last?"
Is anybody listening to me?

1386
01:15:22,857 --> 01:15:26,612
- Where's Moss?
- Is this Levene?

1387
01:15:26,695 --> 01:15:29,616
Perhaps I could assist you.
Excuse us, will you?

1388
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:33,163
I work here! I didn't come in here
to be mistreated!

1389
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:35,917
- Go to lunch, will you?
- That's why I came in to work today.

1390
01:15:36,001 --> 01:15:37,752
The leads come in,
I'll let you know.

1391
01:15:37,794 --> 01:15:39,755
- That's why I came in!
- Just go to lunch.

1392
01:15:39,797 --> 01:15:42,050
- I don't wanna go to lunch!
- Go to lunch, George.

1393
01:15:42,134 --> 01:15:44,053
Where does he get off
talking that way to a working man?

1394
01:15:44,137 --> 01:15:46,265
Take it outside. We have people
trying to do business.

1395
01:15:46,348 --> 01:15:48,476
That's what I came in here for.
That's what I'm trying to do!

1396
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:51,063
- I meet Gestapo tactics.
- Excuse me.

1397
01:15:51,147 --> 01:15:53,190
I meet Gestapo tactics!

1398
01:15:53,274 --> 01:15:55,570
I meet Gestapo tactics.
That's not right.

1399
01:15:55,612 --> 01:16:01,411
No man has the right--
no man has the right--

1400
01:16:01,495 --> 01:16:05,584
"Call an attorney"--
that means you're under--

1401
01:16:05,626 --> 01:16:07,587
he says, "Cooperate
or we'll take you downtown."

1402
01:16:07,629 --> 01:16:09,631
That's not--
as long as I've--

1403
01:16:09,673 --> 01:16:11,133
Will you get out of here?

1404
01:16:11,174 --> 01:16:13,970
Will you get out of here?
Will you?

1405
01:16:14,012 --> 01:16:16,976
I'm trying to run an office here.
Now, will you go to lunch?

1406
01:16:17,059 --> 01:16:21,273
Go to lunch.
Will you go to lunch?

1407
01:16:35,167 --> 01:16:37,337
- Excuse me.
- Where did Moss...?

1408
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:40,550
- Excuse me, please?
- Did he go to the restaurant?

1409
01:16:40,634 --> 01:16:42,928
Will you
excuse me, please?

1410
01:16:46,558 --> 01:16:49,103
I'm sorry, I--

1411
01:16:50,521 --> 01:16:53,861
I apologize to you. It's--

1412
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,488
It's not me,
it's my wife.

1413
01:16:58,575 --> 01:17:00,369
What is it?

1414
01:17:00,411 --> 01:17:02,455
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1415
01:17:02,538 --> 01:17:05,418
- What's going on here?
- Tell me again-- your wife?

1416
01:17:05,502 --> 01:17:07,671
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1417
01:17:08,214 --> 01:17:10,299
She wants her money back.

1418
01:17:10,383 --> 01:17:12,135
We're gonna speak to her.

1419
01:17:12,219 --> 01:17:14,722
No, she told me,
"Right now."

1420
01:17:14,807 --> 01:17:17,185
- We're gonna speak to her, Jim.
- She won't listen.

1421
01:17:17,226 --> 01:17:19,062
- She--
- Roma!

1422
01:17:19,146 --> 01:17:22,692
She said if don't get my money back,
to call the state's attorney.

1423
01:17:22,776 --> 01:17:24,570
No. No.
This is something she said.

1424
01:17:24,612 --> 01:17:27,033
- We don't have to do that.
- She told me I have to.

1425
01:17:27,074 --> 01:17:29,243
- No, Jim.
- I do.

1426
01:17:29,327 --> 01:17:31,038
Listen, I do--
if I don't get my money back--

1427
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:32,957
Roma,
I'm talking to you.

1428
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:36,878
Listen-- will someone
get this guy off my back, please?

1429
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:40,175
- You have a problem?
- Yes, I have a problem!

1430
01:17:40,217 --> 01:17:41,762
Yes, I do, my friend.
It is not me

1431
01:17:41,844 --> 01:17:44,723
that ripped the joint off.
I'm doing business.

1432
01:17:44,765 --> 01:17:48,395
I will be with you
in a while, got it?

1433
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:51,859
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

1434
01:17:54,153 --> 01:17:56,156
This is me!

1435
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:59,994
Jim, this is
Ricky, Jim.

1436
01:18:01,373 --> 01:18:05,336
Jim, anything you want,
you want it, you got it.

1437
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,881
Understand?
This is me.

1438
01:18:07,965 --> 01:18:10,426
Something upset you.

1439
01:18:10,468 --> 01:18:12,763
Yes.
Sit down now.

1440
01:18:12,847 --> 01:18:16,769
Sit down.
You tell me what it is,

1441
01:18:16,811 --> 01:18:20,190
am I gonna
help you fix it?

1442
01:18:20,274 --> 01:18:22,318
You're goddamned
right I am.

1443
01:18:22,401 --> 01:18:24,905
Sit down.

1444
01:18:24,989 --> 01:18:27,576
I'll tell you something,

1445
01:18:27,659 --> 01:18:32,457
sometimes we need
someone from outside.

1446
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:38,007
Sit. Talk to me,
come on.

1447
01:18:42,221 --> 01:18:44,892
I can't negotiate.

1448
01:18:45,684 --> 01:18:48,230
What does that mean?

1449
01:18:49,523 --> 01:18:51,985
What?

1450
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:55,949
What?
Say the words.

1451
01:18:56,032 --> 01:18:58,827
I don't have the power.

1452
01:18:58,869 --> 01:19:00,956
Okay, I said it.

1453
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:04,461
- What power?
- To negotiate.

1454
01:19:04,545 --> 01:19:06,506
To negotiate what?

1455
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:10,721
To negotiate what?

1456
01:19:10,803 --> 01:19:12,639
This.

1457
01:19:12,723 --> 01:19:14,809
- What this?
- The deal.

1458
01:19:14,893 --> 01:19:16,770
The deal?

1459
01:19:16,853 --> 01:19:18,814
Forget the deal, Jim.

1460
01:19:18,898 --> 01:19:21,860
You got something on your mind,
what is it?

1461
01:19:21,943 --> 01:19:24,614
What?

1462
01:19:26,910 --> 01:19:29,246
I can't talk to you.

1463
01:19:29,329 --> 01:19:31,749
You met my wife.

1464
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:34,754
- What?
- Aw...

1465
01:19:36,965 --> 01:19:39,093
I met your wife,
what?

1466
01:19:43,224 --> 01:19:45,519
What, Jim?

1467
01:19:47,522 --> 01:19:49,984
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

1468
01:19:50,067 --> 01:19:51,277
Get a drink,
come on.

1469
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,530
No, no, she told me
not to talk to you.

1470
01:19:53,613 --> 01:19:55,491
Come on, we're gonna
go around the corner.

1471
01:19:55,532 --> 01:19:57,119
We'll have a drink.
Who's gonna know?

1472
01:19:57,202 --> 01:19:59,205
She told me to get
the check back, otherwise--

1473
01:19:59,289 --> 01:20:01,332
Forget the deal, Jimmy.
Forget the deal.

1474
01:20:01,374 --> 01:20:04,879
The deal is dead.
You know me, the deal's dead.

1475
01:20:04,963 --> 01:20:07,340
Am I talking
about the deal?

1476
01:20:07,382 --> 01:20:09,762
That's over.

1477
01:20:09,845 --> 01:20:12,515
Please--
let's talk about you.

1478
01:20:19,108 --> 01:20:21,862
I'm gonna tell you
something.

1479
01:20:21,945 --> 01:20:24,241
Your life is your own.

1480
01:20:26,117 --> 01:20:28,287
You have a contract
with your wife,

1481
01:20:28,371 --> 01:20:31,374
you have certain things
you do jointly,

1482
01:20:31,458 --> 01:20:34,631
you have a bond there.
And there are other things,

1483
01:20:34,713 --> 01:20:40,721
and those things are yours.
You needn't feel ashamed.

1484
01:20:40,805 --> 01:20:43,391
You needn't feel
that you're being untrue

1485
01:20:43,433 --> 01:20:47,648
or that she would
abandon you if she knew.

1486
01:20:47,731 --> 01:20:50,902
This is your life.

1487
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,996
Yes?

1488
01:21:00,625 --> 01:21:04,171
Now, I want to talk to you
because you're obviously upset,

1489
01:21:04,255 --> 01:21:07,259
and that concerns me.

1490
01:21:07,343 --> 01:21:09,762
Let's go,
come on, right now.

1491
01:21:09,846 --> 01:21:11,557
Let's go, come on.

1492
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:13,894
Roma.

1493
01:21:13,977 --> 01:21:16,688
- What?
- The check, it's--

1494
01:21:18,149 --> 01:21:20,319
What did I tell you?

1495
01:21:20,403 --> 01:21:22,281
No, what did I tell you
about the three days?

1496
01:21:22,322 --> 01:21:24,283
Roma, would you?
I'd like to get some lunch.

1497
01:21:24,659 --> 01:21:28,747
I am talking with Mr. Lingk,
if you please.

1498
01:21:28,831 --> 01:21:32,754
I will be with you in a while.
Just check with Mr. Williamson.

1499
01:21:32,837 --> 01:21:36,634
- People downtown said--
- Call them again. Mr. Williamson!

1500
01:21:36,675 --> 01:21:38,762
Yes?

1501
01:21:38,845 --> 01:21:40,889
Mr. Lingk and I
are going to go to the--

1502
01:21:40,973 --> 01:21:43,728
Oh, yes, please.
The police can be--

1503
01:21:43,811 --> 01:21:46,398
- What are the police doing here?
- It's nothing.

1504
01:21:46,482 --> 01:21:50,278
- What are the police doing here?
- We had a slight burglary last night.

1505
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:52,490
It's nothing,
I was just assuring Mr. Lingk.

1506
01:21:52,572 --> 01:21:54,952
Mr. Lingk? James Lingk?
Your contract went out.

1507
01:21:55,036 --> 01:21:56,912
- Nothing to worry about.
- John, John--

1508
01:21:56,996 --> 01:21:58,790
- Your contract went out to the bank.
- You cashed my check?

1509
01:21:58,873 --> 01:22:00,793
- Mr. Williamson--
- The check was cashed.

1510
01:22:00,876 --> 01:22:03,505
The contract was filed
and deposited in the bank,

1511
01:22:03,547 --> 01:22:05,968
and we're completely insured
in any case, as you know.

1512
01:22:06,051 --> 01:22:10,140
- You cashed the check?
- Not to my knowledge, no.

1513
01:22:10,223 --> 01:22:13,019
- Though I'm sure we can--
- Not to my knowledge.

1514
01:22:13,059 --> 01:22:16,357
Christ! I--
Oh, Christ.

1515
01:22:16,441 --> 01:22:18,902
Don't follow me,
just don't follow me, okay?

1516
01:22:21,489 --> 01:22:24,118
I've let you down.
I know I've let you down.

1517
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,455
I'm sorry, forgive me. I-I--

1518
01:22:28,791 --> 01:22:31,545
I don't--
I don't know anymore.

1519
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:37,678
I... forgive me.

1520
01:22:51,907 --> 01:22:54,661
You stupid fucking cunt.

1521
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:58,166
You, Williamson,
I'm talking to you, shithead.

1522
01:22:58,249 --> 01:23:00,878
You just cost me
$6,000.

1523
01:23:00,919 --> 01:23:07,512
$6,000, and one Cadillac.
That's right.

1524
01:23:07,596 --> 01:23:09,932
What are you gonna
do about it?

1525
01:23:10,015 --> 01:23:14,565
What are you
gonna do about it, asshole?

1526
01:23:14,647 --> 01:23:16,566
You're fucking shit.

1527
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:19,028
Where did you
learn your trade,

1528
01:23:19,111 --> 01:23:21,949
you stupid fucking cunt,
you idiot?

1529
01:23:21,991 --> 01:23:24,410
Who ever told you
that you could work with men?

1530
01:23:24,452 --> 01:23:25,871
Could I...?

1531
01:23:25,913 --> 01:23:28,416
Oh, I'm gonna have
your job, shithead.

1532
01:23:28,458 --> 01:23:31,212
I'm going downtown.
I'm gonna talk to Mitch and Murray.

1533
01:23:31,254 --> 01:23:35,301
I'm going to Lemkin!
I don't care whose nephew you are,

1534
01:23:35,384 --> 01:23:38,390
who you know,
whose dick you're sucking on,

1535
01:23:38,473 --> 01:23:40,809
you're going out.
I swear to you--

1536
01:23:40,893 --> 01:23:43,521
Hey, fella,
let's get this done.

1537
01:23:45,523 --> 01:23:49,029
Anyone in this office
lives on his wits--

1538
01:23:49,113 --> 01:23:51,825
I'm gonna be with you
in a second.

1539
01:23:54,537 --> 01:23:58,209
What you're hired for
is to help us.

1540
01:23:58,291 --> 01:24:01,088
Does that seem
clear to you?

1541
01:24:01,130 --> 01:24:06,011
To help us!
Not to fuck us up!

1542
01:24:06,094 --> 01:24:09,266
To help men who are
going out there

1543
01:24:09,308 --> 01:24:12,813
to try to earn a living,
you fairy.

1544
01:24:12,896 --> 01:24:14,648
You company man.

1545
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:17,695
I'll tell you something else,
I hope you ripped the joint off.

1546
01:24:17,778 --> 01:24:21,283
I can tell our friend here something,
might help him to catch you.

1547
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:28,668
You wanna learn
the first rule

1548
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:31,713
you'd know if you ever
spent a day in your life?

1549
01:24:31,797 --> 01:24:37,180
You never open your mouth
till you know what the shot is.

1550
01:24:39,016 --> 01:24:41,728
You fucking child.

1551
01:24:53,995 --> 01:24:57,083
You are a shithead,
Williamson.

1552
01:24:58,962 --> 01:25:02,091
Can't think on your feet,
you ought to keep your mouth closed.

1553
01:25:02,174 --> 01:25:05,345
Can you hear me?
I'm talking to you.

1554
01:25:05,386 --> 01:25:07,222
Yes, I hear you.

1555
01:25:07,306 --> 01:25:10,436
Ricky's right. Can't learn in an office,
gotta learn it in the street.

1556
01:25:10,519 --> 01:25:12,730
And you sure can't buy it,
you gotta live it.

1557
01:25:12,772 --> 01:25:14,775
- Mmmm.
- "Mmmm," yeah!

1558
01:25:14,858 --> 01:25:18,112
Precisely.
Because your partner depends--

1559
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:20,115
I'm talking to you,
trying to tell you something!

1560
01:25:20,199 --> 01:25:21,242
- You are?
- Yeah, I am.

1561
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:23,747
- What are you trying to tell me?
- What Roma was trying to tell you.

1562
01:25:23,829 --> 01:25:27,168
What I told you a long time ago.
You don't belong in this business.

1563
01:25:27,209 --> 01:25:29,504
You might listen to me.
One day you could say,

1564
01:25:29,546 --> 01:25:31,256
"Hey, maybe the guy--"
oh, fuck it.

1565
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:34,344
Listen to me now.
Your partner depends on you.

1566
01:25:34,386 --> 01:25:36,973
The man who is your partner,
depends on you.

1567
01:25:37,056 --> 01:25:40,019
You go with him
and for him or you're shit!

1568
01:25:40,061 --> 01:25:42,313
You are shit--
you can't exist alone.

1569
01:25:42,397 --> 01:25:44,233
- Excuse me.
- "Excuse you," nothing!

1570
01:25:44,275 --> 01:25:47,404
You be as cold as you want.
You just fucked a good man

1571
01:25:47,488 --> 01:25:49,532
out of $6,000
and his goddamned bonus

1572
01:25:49,615 --> 01:25:51,702
because you didn't
know the shot.

1573
01:25:51,785 --> 01:25:54,080
You can do that and you're not
man enough to say it gets you?

1574
01:25:54,122 --> 01:25:57,085
I don't know what--
if you can't take something from that,

1575
01:25:57,169 --> 01:26:00,005
then you're-- scum!
You're fucking white bread.

1576
01:26:00,089 --> 01:26:03,093
A child would know it,
he's right.

1577
01:26:03,177 --> 01:26:06,389
If you're gonna make something up,
be sure that it helps.

1578
01:26:06,431 --> 01:26:09,435
Hmm?
Or keep your mouth shut.

1579
01:26:09,477 --> 01:26:12,273
I'm done with you.

1580
01:26:24,832 --> 01:26:26,417
How do you know
I made it up?

1581
01:26:26,501 --> 01:26:28,838
What?

1582
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,842
How do you know
I made it up?

1583
01:26:31,926 --> 01:26:34,429
What are you
talking about, huh?

1584
01:26:37,099 --> 01:26:40,145
You said, "Don't make something up
unless it's sure to help."

1585
01:26:42,189 --> 01:26:46,822
- How did you know I made it up?
- What are you talking about?

1586
01:26:54,123 --> 01:26:56,878
I told the customer his contract
had gone to the bank.

1587
01:26:56,961 --> 01:26:59,172
Yeah. Well, hadn't it?

1588
01:27:02,886 --> 01:27:04,846
No, it hadn't.

1589
01:27:07,434 --> 01:27:09,102
Don't fuck with me.

1590
01:27:09,186 --> 01:27:11,607
Don't fuck with me!
What are you getting at?

1591
01:27:11,689 --> 01:27:14,443
I'm saying this, Shelly...

1592
01:27:16,946 --> 01:27:19,576
usually I take
the contracts to the bank,

1593
01:27:19,659 --> 01:27:21,912
last night I didn't.

1594
01:27:23,331 --> 01:27:26,460
Last night I stayed home
with my kids.

1595
01:27:28,463 --> 01:27:30,842
How did you know that?

1596
01:27:32,845 --> 01:27:37,684
One night in a year,
I left a contract on my desk.

1597
01:27:37,768 --> 01:27:40,188
No one knew that but you.

1598
01:27:41,483 --> 01:27:43,235
Now, how did you know that?

1599
01:27:43,317 --> 01:27:46,906
You want to talk to me or you
want to talk to someone else?

1600
01:27:46,989 --> 01:27:48,449
Because this is my job!

1601
01:27:48,533 --> 01:27:52,372
This is my job on the line
and you are gonna talk to me!

1602
01:27:52,456 --> 01:27:55,460
Now how did you know
that contract was on my desk?

1603
01:27:55,543 --> 01:27:58,088
You are so full of shit!

1604
01:27:58,172 --> 01:28:00,508
- You robbed the office.
- Oh, sure, I robbed the office.

1605
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:02,678
Oh sure! You asshole.

1606
01:28:02,762 --> 01:28:04,598
What did you do
with the leads?

1607
01:28:04,682 --> 01:28:07,393
You wanna go in there?
I tell him what I know,

1608
01:28:07,435 --> 01:28:10,105
he's gonna dig up something.
You got an alibi last night?

1609
01:28:10,189 --> 01:28:13,568
You better have one!
What did you do with the leads?

1610
01:28:13,652 --> 01:28:16,823
If you tell me what you did
with the leads, we can talk.

1611
01:28:16,907 --> 01:28:19,243
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1612
01:28:19,285 --> 01:28:21,664
If you tell me where the leads are,
I won't turn you in.

1613
01:28:21,747 --> 01:28:24,125
If you don't, I'm gonna tell
the cop you stole them.

1614
01:28:24,209 --> 01:28:27,338
Mitch and Murray will see that you
go to jail, believe me, they will!

1615
01:28:27,422 --> 01:28:28,840
Now, where are the leads?

1616
01:28:28,924 --> 01:28:30,969
I'm walking in that door.
You got five seconds

1617
01:28:31,052 --> 01:28:32,679
- or you are going to jail!
- Go ahead.

1618
01:28:32,763 --> 01:28:35,224
I don't care,
you understand?

1619
01:28:36,433 --> 01:28:38,979
Where are the leads?

1620
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:42,484
All right.

1621
01:28:44,445 --> 01:28:46,407
I sold them.

1622
01:28:55,377 --> 01:28:57,881
To Jerry Graff.

1623
01:28:57,964 --> 01:29:00,260
How much did you
get for them?

1624
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:02,179
How much did
you get for them?

1625
01:29:02,263 --> 01:29:04,599
Five.
Five grand.

1626
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:07,520
- I got half.
- Who got the other half?

1627
01:29:07,603 --> 01:29:09,606
Do I have to tell you?

1628
01:29:09,648 --> 01:29:12,193
Moss.

1629
01:29:15,781 --> 01:29:17,826
Well, that was easy,
wasn't it?

1630
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:20,413
- His idea.
- Was it?

1631
01:29:20,496 --> 01:29:22,749
I think he got
more than five, actually.

1632
01:29:22,791 --> 01:29:26,129
- Uh-huh.
- He told me my cut was 2500.

1633
01:29:26,171 --> 01:29:28,425
Mmm.

1634
01:29:29,968 --> 01:29:31,637
Wait a minute.
Okay-- hey, hey, John!

1635
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:34,891
Wait-- okay, John!
Hey, Johnny.

1636
01:29:34,975 --> 01:29:38,480
Listen.
Come here, come here.

1637
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:42,402
Eh, John?

1638
01:29:42,485 --> 01:29:44,739
Last night...

1639
01:29:44,822 --> 01:29:47,492
I gotta tell you,
I'm ready to "do the Dutch."

1640
01:29:47,534 --> 01:29:50,497
I'm done. Moss gets me,
"Do this, we'll get well."

1641
01:29:50,539 --> 01:29:53,835
Why not? Big fucking deal.
I'm halfway hoping to get caught.

1642
01:29:53,919 --> 01:29:58,049
Hey-- put me out of my misery.
It taught me something, John.

1643
01:29:58,132 --> 01:30:00,595
What it taught me--
you gotta get out there!

1644
01:30:00,678 --> 01:30:04,016
I'm not cut out to be a thief,
I'm cut out to be a salesman.

1645
01:30:04,183 --> 01:30:06,895
And I am back.
I got my balls back.

1646
01:30:06,979 --> 01:30:10,942
Now... you got a slight
advantage on me.

1647
01:30:11,026 --> 01:30:13,613
But whatever it takes, John,

1648
01:30:13,697 --> 01:30:16,200
to make things right,
we're gonna make it right.

1649
01:30:16,284 --> 01:30:18,871
We are going
to make it right.

1650
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:24,087
I want to tell you
something, Shelly.

1651
01:30:24,169 --> 01:30:27,841
- Eh?
- You have a big mouth.

1652
01:30:27,883 --> 01:30:30,428
What?

1653
01:30:30,512 --> 01:30:32,222
You've got a big mouth!

1654
01:30:32,264 --> 01:30:35,019
And now I'm gonna show you
an even bigger one.

1655
01:30:35,061 --> 01:30:36,938
Where are you going?

1656
01:30:37,021 --> 01:30:39,733
You can't do that!
You don't want to do that.

1657
01:30:39,816 --> 01:30:42,070
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1658
01:30:43,822 --> 01:30:47,327
It's $2,500. Go ahead
and take it, take it all.

1659
01:30:47,411 --> 01:30:49,748
No, I don't think so.
I don't think I want your money.

1660
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:52,751
I think you fucked up my office,
and I think you're going away.

1661
01:30:52,793 --> 01:30:56,756
Are you nuts?
I'm gonna close for you! Take--

1662
01:30:56,798 --> 01:31:00,262
I'm gonna make this office and be
number one on that board again.

1663
01:31:00,304 --> 01:31:02,599
Wait, John.

1664
01:31:02,682 --> 01:31:06,186
John-- okay.

1665
01:31:08,982 --> 01:31:13,364
This is what
we're gonna do-- 20%.

1666
01:31:13,406 --> 01:31:16,618
I'm gonna give you 20%
of all my sales.

1667
01:31:16,702 --> 01:31:19,623
20%, as long as I'm
with this firm.

1668
01:31:19,706 --> 01:31:21,709
50.

1669
01:31:21,793 --> 01:31:26,257
- 50%of all my sales.
- What sales?

1670
01:31:26,299 --> 01:31:28,468
What sales? My God,
I just closed 82 grand.

1671
01:31:28,552 --> 01:31:31,681
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I'm back! This is just the beginning!

1672
01:31:31,764 --> 01:31:34,227
Just the beginning?
Where have you been, Shelly?

1673
01:31:34,269 --> 01:31:37,273
Bruce and Harriett Nyborg--
do you want to see the memos?

1674
01:31:37,314 --> 01:31:40,903
They're nuts.
They used to call in every week--

1675
01:31:40,986 --> 01:31:43,531
when I was with Webb--
we were selling Arizona.

1676
01:31:43,615 --> 01:31:45,660
They're nuts.

1677
01:31:45,743 --> 01:31:51,125
Did you see how they were living?
How can you delude yourself?

1678
01:31:51,167 --> 01:31:53,128
- I've got their check.
- Forget it. Frame it.

1679
01:31:53,211 --> 01:31:55,423
- It's worthless.
- The check is no good?

1680
01:31:55,465 --> 01:31:57,844
You want to stick around?
I'll pull the memo. I'm busy.

1681
01:31:57,927 --> 01:31:59,805
The check is no good?
They're nuts?

1682
01:31:59,888 --> 01:32:01,723
You want to call the bank?
I called them.

1683
01:32:01,807 --> 01:32:05,479
I called them four months ago
when we first got the lead.

1684
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,317
The people are insane.

1685
01:32:09,777 --> 01:32:13,198
They just like talking
to salesmen.

1686
01:32:18,205 --> 01:32:22,461
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

1687
01:32:25,048 --> 01:32:29,012
- Why?
- Because I don't like you.

1688
01:32:35,772 --> 01:32:37,774
My daughter.

1689
01:32:37,858 --> 01:32:40,028
Fuck you.

1690
01:32:55,216 --> 01:32:57,594
Asshole.

1691
01:32:57,678 --> 01:33:00,848
Guy couldn't find his fucking couch
in the living room.

1692
01:33:03,018 --> 01:33:05,396
What a day.

1693
01:33:05,481 --> 01:33:07,484
Whoo...

1694
01:33:07,567 --> 01:33:09,987
I haven't even had
a cup of coffee.

1695
01:33:13,534 --> 01:33:17,205
Jag-off John opens his mouth,
blows my Cadillac.

1696
01:33:19,709 --> 01:33:23,297
I swear,
it's not a world of men.

1697
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,512
It is not
a world of men, "Machine."

1698
01:33:28,554 --> 01:33:31,392
- Huh?
- It's a world of clock-watchers...

1699
01:33:31,434 --> 01:33:34,063
bureaucrats...

1700
01:33:34,145 --> 01:33:36,899
officeholders, what it is.

1701
01:33:37,942 --> 01:33:40,238
It's a fucked-up world.

1702
01:33:42,575 --> 01:33:44,577
No adventure to it.

1703
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:48,916
Dying breed.
Yes, it is.

1704
01:33:50,585 --> 01:33:54,341
We're the members of a dying breed.
That's-- that's--

1705
01:33:54,425 --> 01:33:58,179
that's why we got
to stick together. Shel?

1706
01:33:58,263 --> 01:34:00,600
- Huh?
- I want to talk to you.

1707
01:34:00,682 --> 01:34:02,978
I've wanted to talk to you
for some time--

1708
01:34:03,061 --> 01:34:06,942
for a long time, actually.
I said, "The Machine"--

1709
01:34:07,026 --> 01:34:10,447
there's a man
I would work with.

1710
01:34:10,489 --> 01:34:14,244
There's--" you know,
I never said a word.

1711
01:34:14,286 --> 01:34:17,248
I don't know why I didn't.
I should've, I don't know why.

1712
01:34:17,290 --> 01:34:21,129
And that shit you were slinging
on my guy today--

1713
01:34:21,212 --> 01:34:25,385
that was so good.
That-- it--

1714
01:34:25,467 --> 01:34:28,264
excuse me for saying this,
it's not even my place to say it.

1715
01:34:28,306 --> 01:34:30,892
That was admirable.

1716
01:34:30,976 --> 01:34:33,646
It was the old stuff.

1717
01:34:33,688 --> 01:34:37,276
Hey, I've been
on a hot streak.

1718
01:34:37,318 --> 01:34:41,073
So what?
Things I can learn from you.

1719
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:45,329
- You eat today?
- Me?

1720
01:34:45,413 --> 01:34:46,914
Yeah.

1721
01:34:46,998 --> 01:34:50,337
Want to swing around the Chinks'--
watch me eat, we'll talk?

1722
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:52,757
I think
I'll stay around awhile.

1723
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:54,801
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz?

1724
01:34:54,843 --> 01:34:56,971
This is Richard Roma
with Premiere Properties.

1725
01:34:57,013 --> 01:34:59,975
You or your accountant requested
information on a land investment

1726
01:35:00,016 --> 01:35:02,646
which would offer you
depreciation and the chance

1727
01:35:02,688 --> 01:35:04,898
of a substantial return
on a small investment.

1728
01:35:04,982 --> 01:35:07,402
I'm in from Florida
just for one day...

1729
01:35:07,485 --> 01:35:11,324
- Mr. Levene?
- ...so I only have that one lot left.

1730
01:35:11,366 --> 01:35:13,203
Would you come in here,
please?

1731
01:35:13,286 --> 01:35:15,664
I don't have too much time
and I'm on the midnight plane back,

1732
01:35:15,706 --> 01:35:18,168
so if you or your husband
are truly interested--

1733
01:35:18,209 --> 01:35:20,671
because I can't hold
this parcel past--

1734
01:35:20,754 --> 01:35:23,258
Yes?

1735
01:35:23,341 --> 01:35:26,304
Well, what would be better
for you-- say, 6:00 or 8:00?

1736
01:35:27,681 --> 01:35:31,812
Go ask him. Shel-- we're gonna talk?
I'm going to the Chinks'.

1737
01:35:31,895 --> 01:35:33,856
When you're done, come down.
We're gonna smoke a cigarette.

1738
01:35:33,897 --> 01:35:36,025
- I...
- Get in the room.

1739
01:35:36,109 --> 01:35:40,031
Hey. Hey, easy, pal.
That's "The Machine."

1740
01:35:40,073 --> 01:35:43,119
This is Shelly
"The Machine" Levene.

1741
01:35:43,203 --> 01:35:45,539
- Get in the goddamn room.
- Rick, I...

1742
01:35:45,623 --> 01:35:47,793
- I'll meet you at the restaurant.
- Ricky--

1743
01:35:47,876 --> 01:35:49,712
- Ricky can't help you.
- All I want is--

1744
01:35:49,796 --> 01:35:51,841
What do you want?
You want to what?

1745
01:35:51,923 --> 01:35:55,846
- Rick? Rick?
- Hello? Excellent.

1746
01:35:57,264 --> 01:36:02,105
8:00 p.m.
6947 Euclid.

1747
01:36:02,188 --> 01:36:04,900
Not at all--
thank you very much.

1748
01:36:15,582 --> 01:36:18,836
They find the guy
that broke in the office?

1749
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:22,090
No. I don't know.

1750
01:36:26,931 --> 01:36:29,017
Did the leads
come in yet?

1751
01:36:29,101 --> 01:36:31,562
No.

1752
01:36:39,449 --> 01:36:41,743
Oh God,
I hate this job.

1753
01:36:41,785 --> 01:36:43,913
Anybody wants me,
I'm at the restaurant.

1754
01:36:49,463 --> 01:36:52,300
Hello, Mrs. Delgari?

1755
01:36:52,342 --> 01:36:55,596
Yes-- you requested some information
about Rio Rancho Properties?

1756
01:36:55,805 --> 01:37:00,520
# Blue skies smiling at me #

1757
01:37:00,604 --> 01:37:05,861
# Nothing but blue skies
do I see #

1758
01:37:05,944 --> 01:37:08,949
# In the morning
there's bluebirds #

1759
01:37:09,032 --> 01:37:11,953
# Singing a song #

1760
01:37:11,995 --> 01:37:14,957
# Nothing but bluebirds #

1761
01:37:14,998 --> 01:37:17,961
# From now on #

1762
01:37:18,045 --> 01:37:21,133
# I never saw the sun
shining so bright #

1763
01:37:21,216 --> 01:37:23,970
# Never saw things
going so right #

1764
01:37:24,054 --> 01:37:26,974
# Noticing the days
hurrying by #

1765
01:37:27,015 --> 01:37:30,478
# When you're in love,
my, how they fly #

1766
01:37:30,562 --> 01:37:34,902
# Blue days,
all of them gone #

1767
01:37:34,986 --> 01:37:39,992
# Nothing but blue skies
from now on... #

1768
01:38:25,348 --> 01:38:29,938
# Blue skies
smiling at me #

1769
01:38:30,021 --> 01:38:35,696
# Nothing but blue skies
do I see #

1770
01:38:35,738 --> 01:38:38,116
# In the morning
there's bluebirds #

1771
01:38:38,199 --> 01:38:41,245
# Singing a song #

1772
01:38:41,328 --> 01:38:46,169
# Nothing but, nothing but
bluebirds from now on #

1773
01:38:46,253 --> 01:38:48,631
# Let me tell you
I never saw the sun #

1774
01:38:48,714 --> 01:38:50,258
# Shining so bright #

1775
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:53,179
# Never saw things
going so right #

1776
01:38:53,262 --> 01:38:55,974
# Noticing the days
hurrying by #

1777
01:38:56,058 --> 01:38:59,021
# When you're in love,
my, how they fly #

1778
01:38:59,104 --> 01:39:03,735
# Blue skies
smiling at me #

1779
01:39:03,818 --> 01:39:09,035
# Nothing but blue skies
do I see #

1780
01:39:09,077 --> 01:39:11,287
# In the morning
there's bluebirds #

1781
01:39:11,371 --> 01:39:14,750
# Singing a song #

1782
01:39:14,834 --> 01:39:19,592
# Nothing but, nothing but
bluebirds from now on #

1783
01:39:19,675 --> 01:39:22,053
# Let me tell you
I never saw the sun #

1784
01:39:22,095 --> 01:39:23,889
# Shining so bright #

1785
01:39:23,931 --> 01:39:26,476
# Never saw things
going so right #

1786
01:39:26,559 --> 01:39:29,439
# Noticing the days
hurrying by #

1787
01:39:29,522 --> 01:39:32,151
# When you're in love,
my how they fly #

1788
01:39:32,234 --> 01:39:35,279
# Blue days #

1789
01:39:35,363 --> 01:39:37,783
# All of them,
all of them gone #

1790
01:39:37,866 --> 01:39:42,666
# Nothing but blue skies
from now on #

1791
01:39:42,749 --> 01:39:48,214
# Nothing but blue skies
from now on #

1792
01:39:48,298 --> 01:39:54,014
# Nothing but blue skies
from now on #

1793
01:39:54,098 --> 01:39:56,935
# Now on #

1794
01:39:56,977 --> 01:40:05,155
# Nothing but blue skies. #
