1
00:00:43,263 --> 00:00:46,583
People once believed
that when someone dies...

2
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,703
a crow carries their soul
to the land of the dead.

3
00:00:50,523 --> 00:00:53,473
But sometimes,
something so bad happens...

4
00:00:53,903 --> 00:00:57,703
that a terrible sadness is carried
with it and the soul can't rest.

5
00:00:59,223 --> 00:01:01,663
Then sometimes,
just sometimes...

6
00:01:02,223 --> 00:01:06,303
the crow can bring that soul back
to put the wrong things right.

7
00:01:48,383 --> 00:01:50,183
Over here.

8
00:01:54,743 --> 00:01:56,263
Hey, Sarge!

9
00:01:56,823 --> 00:01:58,103
Yeah?

10
00:01:59,023 --> 00:02:02,903
Shelly Webster and Eric Draven.
Wedding was tomorrow night.

11
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:06,383
Who the fuck gets married
on Halloween anyhow?

12
00:02:07,663 --> 00:02:09,023
Nobody.

13
00:02:10,983 --> 00:02:13,653
- Sir, we gotta move her.
- Do it.

14
00:02:13,903 --> 00:02:16,143
All right, guys,
let's do it.

15
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:19,143
Devil's fuckin' Night.
What's the count so far?

16
00:02:19,303 --> 00:02:20,663
143 fires.

17
00:02:20,663 --> 00:02:23,423
- They're slacking off from last year.
- Three hours to go.

18
00:02:23,423 --> 00:02:26,663
- Maybe they're just slow starters.
- Coming through!

19
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:34,223
You guys can't come in here
and take her away like this.

20
00:02:34,223 --> 00:02:37,943
There are procedures. You should have
cleared this with me first

21
00:02:38,903 --> 00:02:41,143
- Is this the victim?
- No, it's Amelia Earhart.

22
00:02:41,143 --> 00:02:43,983
- We found her, and you missed it.
- I don't care what her name is.

23
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:46,833
I didn't give the order to move her.
Jesus, Albrecht.

24
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,733
I can see why they took away
your gold shield.

25
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:52,903
Yeah, I wasn't a big enough asshole.
Come on. Let's go.

26
00:02:52,903 --> 00:02:55,463
- All right, clear out.

27
00:02:56,063 --> 00:02:58,303
- Shelly?
- Stand back, kid.

28
00:03:00,703 --> 00:03:03,623
- Where's Eric?
- Just don't worry about him.

29
00:03:05,123 --> 00:03:07,273
Tell him to take care
of Sarah.

30
00:03:07,523 --> 00:03:11,523
Look, I will.
You just, uh, lie back. Come on.

31
00:03:20,343 --> 00:03:22,263
- You Sarah?
- Yeah.

32
00:03:23,223 --> 00:03:26,143
Yeah, look. Your sister,
she's gonna be okay.

33
00:03:27,143 --> 00:03:30,263
She's not my sister.
Shelly just takes care of me.

34
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,343
She's my friend.

35
00:03:32,663 --> 00:03:34,263
Her and Eric.

36
00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:38,623
You lied to her about Eric.

37
00:03:38,663 --> 00:03:40,103
I had to.

38
00:03:40,623 --> 00:03:43,183
And you're lying
to me about Shelly.

39
00:03:43,903 --> 00:03:46,103
She's gonna die,
isn't she?

40
00:03:48,923 --> 00:03:50,363
Hey, uh--

41
00:03:55,983 --> 00:03:59,023
Now, come on.
Come on. It's okay.

42
00:04:01,863 --> 00:04:03,743
She's gonna be fine.

43
00:04:21,863 --> 00:04:25,493
A building gets torched.
All that is left is ashes.

44
00:04:25,743 --> 00:04:28,623
I used to think that was true
about everything...

45
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:32,023
families, friends, feelings.

46
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:36,493
But now I know that sometimes,
if love proves real...

47
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:40,923
two people who are meant to be together,
nothing can keep them apart.

48
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:08,623
Later.

49
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,223
What are you,
like the night watchman?

50
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:43,813
You know, what this place
needs is a...

51
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,533
good natural catastrophe.

52
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:50,813
- Earthquake, tornado, you know.
- No, no, no, no.

53
00:05:51,063 --> 00:05:53,983
Mickey, come on, man. You got to put
the mustard underneath first.

54
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:56,263
Maybe a flood like in the Bible.

55
00:05:56,263 --> 00:05:58,263
Hey, hey, let me do it.

56
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:02,933
There we go. All right.
How about some onions?

57
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:05,623
Come on, man.
Don't cheap out on me.

58
00:06:05,623 --> 00:06:07,543
- Lots of onions.
- All right, here you go.

59
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:09,223
Hey, all right.

60
00:06:09,863 --> 00:06:11,663
Now we're talkin'.

61
00:06:12,303 --> 00:06:15,353
Hey, it's the Sarah monster.

62
00:06:16,863 --> 00:06:20,343
- How do you steer that on a wet street?
- Pure talent. Hi.

63
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:24,173
Now, Sarah, she's a genuine hot dogger.
You hungry?

64
00:06:24,423 --> 00:06:26,223
- You buyin'?
- I'm buyin'.

65
00:06:26,223 --> 00:06:29,513
- No onions though, okay?
- No onions?

66
00:06:29,863 --> 00:06:32,823
They make you fart big time.

67
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,703
You know, Lake Erie
actually caught on fire once...

68
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:44,423
from all the crap
floating around in it.

69
00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:48,263
I wish I could have seen that.

70
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:49,263
Fire it up! Yeah!

71
00:08:28,623 --> 00:08:32,133
- All right, we busted their machines!
- Shit!

72
00:08:54,343 --> 00:08:57,713
Oh, oh, shit, guys.
T-bird, cop car, cop car.

73
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,183
Bad people out
on the street tonight.

74
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:14,783
- Damn it!
- What was that?

75
00:09:14,783 --> 00:09:17,343
- You wait right here.
- Be careful.

76
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:20,463
Mickey, call it in for me!

77
00:10:38,863 --> 00:10:40,943
Gabriel.

78
00:10:50,623 --> 00:10:53,703
- Eric?
- Department of Housing!

79
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:57,213
Code violations?
Safety hazards?

80
00:10:58,063 --> 00:11:00,063
Place looks fine to me.

81
00:11:00,263 --> 00:11:02,023
Let's redecorate.

82
00:11:05,923 --> 00:11:08,773
"Abash, the devil stood...

83
00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:11,383
and felt how awful goodness is.

84
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:16,673
Saw virtue in her shape, how lovely."
It's pornography.

85
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,543
Virtue?

86
00:11:22,443 --> 00:11:24,443
Shelly?

87
00:11:26,063 --> 00:11:28,783
- No! Eric!
- See ya!

88
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,983
No, no, no, me first.

89
00:11:33,703 --> 00:11:35,063
Please.

90
00:11:37,383 --> 00:11:39,183
- Shelly.
- Eric!

91
00:12:17,543 --> 00:12:20,343
- Hey, that's good.
- That's good.

92
00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:27,063
See if you can top that, man.
Can you top that?

93
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,783
Look at that.
Look at that.

94
00:12:30,743 --> 00:12:34,373
Here's to Devil's Night,
my new favorite holiday.

95
00:12:38,463 --> 00:12:40,503
You go over there
and talk to your pals--

96
00:12:41,403 --> 00:12:43,713
You sick fuck.

97
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:47,083
Are you out of
your motherfuckin' mind, man?

98
00:12:52,543 --> 00:12:54,143
Look at that!

99
00:12:55,903 --> 00:12:57,943
Pussies drink last, man.

100
00:12:59,063 --> 00:13:01,713
- Fuck you, Tin Tin.
- Hey.

101
00:13:03,303 --> 00:13:05,543
Shit ain't even loaded, man.

102
00:13:05,863 --> 00:13:07,423
This one is.

103
00:13:07,943 --> 00:13:10,573
Which of you Motor City
motherfuckers...

104
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,183
wants to bet me this one isn't?

105
00:13:15,063 --> 00:13:18,613
Hey, fire it up!
Fire it up!

106
00:13:18,863 --> 00:13:21,663
- Fire it up!
- Fire it up!
- Fire it up!

107
00:13:21,903 --> 00:13:24,403
Fire it up! Fire it up!

108
00:13:25,663 --> 00:13:27,413
Here's your shooters.

109
00:13:27,663 --> 00:13:29,703
- Put your guns away, huh, guys?
- How ya doin'?

110
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:31,143
Pussycat.

111
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:54,923
Boo.

112
00:14:03,503 --> 00:14:06,693
- I love you.
- Say that again.

113
00:14:06,943 --> 00:14:08,463
I love you.

114
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,343
Oh, boy.

115
00:14:12,303 --> 00:14:14,383
Restaurant.

116
00:14:20,063 --> 00:14:23,263
- Wow, you look great.
- Ta-da!

117
00:14:26,143 --> 00:14:28,143
Yeah!

118
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:32,583
- Come here!
- No, no, no!

119
00:16:06,503 --> 00:16:08,823
Couple more rings.
That's 24k.

120
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:12,613
24k, huh? It's 18k.
It's crap. It's probably fake.

121
00:16:12,863 --> 00:16:14,863
Leather purse. Leather.

122
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:19,333
Geez. Oh, what is this, Tin Tin?

123
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,863
A blood stain that's on here?

124
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,663
I'll give you 50 bucks.
And I hate charities.

125
00:16:26,663 --> 00:16:28,983
Now, you,
take it or leave it.

126
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,563
Right there for ya.

127
00:16:33,443 --> 00:16:35,363
Decisions, decisions.

128
00:16:37,823 --> 00:16:40,943
You cheap ass, chrome dome...

129
00:16:40,943 --> 00:16:43,693
...child molestin',
saprophyte motherfucker.

130
00:16:43,943 --> 00:16:45,513
Close the gate
when you go out!

131
00:16:45,763 --> 00:16:48,653
Oh, I close this up
for you real good, massa.

132
00:16:48,903 --> 00:16:51,063
Fuck you.

133
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,883
Yeah, sit on it and twirl,
you dirty scum.

134
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:01,623
Lucky I didn't stab
your fat ass.

135
00:18:43,743 --> 00:18:46,983
What the fuck you all painted
up for, crackhead, huh?

136
00:18:50,903 --> 00:18:53,453
Halloween ain't till manana.

137
00:18:56,983 --> 00:18:58,383
Come on.

138
00:19:34,023 --> 00:19:36,713
Fuck, you murderer!

139
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,943
I ain't murdered nobody, man!
I don't even fucking know you!

140
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:43,783
- Man, what the fuck you want, man?
- I want you to tell me a story.

141
00:19:43,943 --> 00:19:46,623
A man and a woman
in a loft a year ago.

142
00:19:47,343 --> 00:19:49,823
- You're out of your fucking mind--
- Listen!

143
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:54,333
I'm sure you'll remember.
You killed them... on Halloween.

144
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:58,943
Yeah, yeah, Halloween, yeah.
Some dude, some bitch, whatever, man.

145
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:01,783
Her name was Shelly.

146
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,983
You cut her.
You raped her.

147
00:20:04,783 --> 00:20:09,703
Shelly, yeah, yeah. I shanked
her pink ass and she loved it!

148
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:23,733
Murderer? Murderer? Let me tell you
about murder. It's fun!

149
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:28,403
It's easy.
You gonna learn all about it.

150
00:20:32,903 --> 00:20:35,813
I'd like you to meet
two buddies of mine.

151
00:20:36,663 --> 00:20:38,303
We never miss.

152
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:48,153
Try harder.

153
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:50,323
- Try again!
- Aaah!

154
00:20:56,183 --> 00:20:59,723
Victims.
Aren't we all?

155
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:27,713
- Look at this mess!
What's the world comin' to?
- It's a mess.

156
00:21:34,623 --> 00:21:37,343
I got to go upstairs.
Report from the front.

157
00:21:41,783 --> 00:21:44,063
Get out of my way,
you worms!

158
00:21:46,023 --> 00:21:48,423
Give me some of that
over there!

159
00:21:50,063 --> 00:21:53,163
Why don't you ladies come by later?
Check me out.

160
00:21:53,663 --> 00:21:58,093
Hey, guess what?
Arcade Games fell down, went boom.

161
00:21:58,343 --> 00:22:01,773
- Boom.
- Can you imagine that? It's tragic.

162
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:06,393
Gather your soldiers.
You're on for tomorrow night. No sweat.

163
00:22:06,643 --> 00:22:09,453
- Is the man in?
- He's taking a meeting.

164
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:41,183
You're thinking
about the past.

165
00:22:44,703 --> 00:22:46,463
Dad gave me this.

166
00:22:47,183 --> 00:22:48,863
Fifth birthday.

167
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:55,213
He said childhood's over
the moment you know you're gonna die.

168
00:23:08,663 --> 00:23:10,453
Is she asleep?

169
00:23:17,343 --> 00:23:19,263
I think we broke her.

170
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:26,063
I love her eyes.

171
00:23:26,383 --> 00:23:27,743
Pretty.

172
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:10,173
I told you to stay out of here.

173
00:24:10,423 --> 00:24:14,023
So I guess you're not gonna be home
till a lot later, huh, Darla?

174
00:24:14,023 --> 00:24:17,733
She's busy. Go play with your dolls
or something, okay?

175
00:24:17,983 --> 00:24:19,983
I don't have any dolls.

176
00:24:22,303 --> 00:24:24,143
Get some food, huh?

177
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:26,543
Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police.

178
00:24:31,863 --> 00:24:35,703
"Somebody already bought me dinner.
The police."

179
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:46,983
Thirty, forty dollars.

180
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,903
Who the fuck is this now?

181
00:24:52,263 --> 00:24:56,013
Hey! Piss off!
We're closed!

182
00:24:56,263 --> 00:24:58,383
Cerrado!

183
00:24:58,943 --> 00:25:02,943
Sleep it off somewhere else, dusthead,
unless you want to get mutilated.

184
00:25:09,903 --> 00:25:13,433
Goddamn creatures of the night,
they never learn.

185
00:25:15,663 --> 00:25:17,103
Hey! Hey!

186
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:25,333
"Suddenly I heard
a tapping, as if someone...

187
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:28,853
gently rapping,
rapping at my chamber door."

188
00:25:31,223 --> 00:25:33,383
What are you talking about?

189
00:25:33,543 --> 00:25:35,743
You heard me rapping, right?

190
00:25:36,183 --> 00:25:39,913
You're trespassing,
and you owe me a fuckin' new door!

191
00:25:42,463 --> 00:25:45,383
I'm looking for something
in an engagement ring.

192
00:25:45,383 --> 00:25:46,663
Gold.

193
00:25:46,823 --> 00:25:49,783
You're looking for a coroner,
shit-for-brains.

194
00:25:53,143 --> 00:25:55,263
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit on me!

195
00:25:58,103 --> 00:26:00,143
Shit on me.
Shit on me!

196
00:26:06,463 --> 00:26:08,423
- Aaah!
- Mr. Gideon.

197
00:26:08,663 --> 00:26:10,863
You're not paying attention.

198
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,833
No!

199
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:20,973
I repeat, a gold
engagement ring, yes?

200
00:26:22,463 --> 00:26:26,263
It was pawned here a year ago
by a customer of yours named Tin Tin.

201
00:26:28,683 --> 00:26:31,893
He confided in me
before he ran out of breath.

202
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:38,983
Who's this sack of shit?

203
00:26:38,983 --> 00:26:41,863
That's Tin Tin, one of
T-bird's little helpers.

204
00:26:41,863 --> 00:26:44,663
I think you can rule out
accidental death.

205
00:26:44,863 --> 00:26:47,623
Don't any of your street demons
have real grown-up names?

206
00:26:47,623 --> 00:26:51,623
This could be a turf hit, but it doesn't
look like your usual gang crap.

207
00:26:51,703 --> 00:26:56,013
Come on, Albrecht, spare me.
You're a beat cop now, so be a beat cop.

208
00:26:56,263 --> 00:26:58,183
I'm suppose to thank you
for that, right?

209
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:01,873
Word to the wise:
Watch your fuckin' mouth.

210
00:27:02,983 --> 00:27:05,343
What the hell
do you call that?

211
00:27:07,303 --> 00:27:09,463
I call it blood, detective.

212
00:27:08,863 --> 00:27:12,223
I suppose you'll write it up
as graffiti.

213
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:15,263
You can leave
my crime scene now, okay?

214
00:27:22,663 --> 00:27:23,753
- Warmer?
- What are you doing?

215
00:27:24,003 --> 00:27:26,853
- Don't you know this game?
- What game are you talkin' about?

216
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,983
Okay, the rings!
I'll tell you about the rings!

217
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:33,263
They're in that metal box!
It's under the shelf there!

218
00:27:34,263 --> 00:27:39,803
Take the fucking rings!
Choke on them, you son of a bitch!

219
00:27:43,023 --> 00:27:45,623
- Look, it goes to the attic.
- Okay.

220
00:27:54,263 --> 00:27:55,973
No, no.

221
00:27:56,303 --> 00:27:58,673
No, no, no.

222
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:05,043
Oh, it's beautiful.
I don't believe it.

223
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:10,823
Shelly.

224
00:28:19,543 --> 00:28:21,063
I love you.

225
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:31,463
- You have one chance to live.
- Take anything you want.

226
00:28:31,463 --> 00:28:33,743
- Thank you.
- Take anything!

227
00:28:35,603 --> 00:28:37,693
Now you're going to tell me
where to find...

228
00:28:37,943 --> 00:28:39,393
the rest of Tin Tin's
little party pals.

229
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:41,963
The Pit. They all
hang out at The Pit.

230
00:28:42,263 --> 00:28:46,343
T-birds's little potato-heads hang out
there. Funboy lives there upstairs.

231
00:28:47,223 --> 00:28:50,273
- Funboy.
- Oh, baby, oh.

232
00:28:50,923 --> 00:28:53,363
- A whole jolly club...
- Please!

233
00:28:53,903 --> 00:28:56,583
- with jolly pirate nicknames!
- Stop! Please!

234
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:59,383
- Jesus Christ in a taxicab!
- Hold still!

235
00:29:00,783 --> 00:29:03,413
Each one of these is a life...

236
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:06,223
a life you helped destroy.

237
00:29:06,943 --> 00:29:09,303
I'm begging you.
Don't kill me.

238
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:12,143
I'm not gonna kill you.

239
00:29:12,743 --> 00:29:16,823
Your job will be to tell the rest
of them that death is coming for them...

240
00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:18,223
tonight.

241
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:28,183
Tell them Eric Draven
sends his regards.

242
00:29:30,863 --> 00:29:34,223
You walk outta here,
they're gonna erase your sorry ass.

243
00:29:34,823 --> 00:29:38,133
You're nothing but street grease,
you motherfucker!

244
00:29:38,383 --> 00:29:40,463
Is that gasoline I smell?

245
00:29:40,583 --> 00:29:42,343
No, man, no!
No!

246
00:29:43,463 --> 00:29:44,663
No!

247
00:29:45,503 --> 00:29:46,703
No!

248
00:30:01,823 --> 00:30:04,543
It's on the house, kiddo,
you know that.

249
00:30:05,223 --> 00:30:06,863
One root beer.

250
00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:11,783
I can't do anything.

251
00:30:11,983 --> 00:30:15,653
Your mom... technically,
she's off right now.

252
00:30:16,383 --> 00:30:18,023
Yeah, way off.

253
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:26,663
Police! Don't move!
I said, "Don't move!"

254
00:30:27,623 --> 00:30:30,543
I thought the police
always said, "Freeze!"

255
00:30:30,543 --> 00:30:34,383
I am the police and I say don't move,
Snow White. You move, you're dead.

256
00:30:34,883 --> 00:30:38,713
And I say I'm dead
and I move.

257
00:30:39,723 --> 00:30:42,453
Not one more step.
I'm serious.

258
00:30:42,703 --> 00:30:46,693
Then shoot, if you will,
Officer Albrecht.

259
00:30:46,943 --> 00:30:49,623
What are you, nuts?
Walking into a gun?

260
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:51,493
You high?

261
00:30:51,943 --> 00:30:54,573
- You don't remember me?
- What are you talking about?

262
00:30:54,923 --> 00:30:58,493
How about Shelly?
Do you remember Shelly Webster?

263
00:30:58,743 --> 00:31:01,143
Shelly Webster's dead, my friend.

264
00:31:01,383 --> 00:31:05,453
I want you to move over to the curb,
nice and easy. Come on! Move it!

265
00:31:07,903 --> 00:31:10,593
Okay, we're gonna
wait here for backup.

266
00:31:10,843 --> 00:31:14,693
- It's gettin' too weird for me.
- Oh, it gets better.

267
00:31:14,943 --> 00:31:17,303
Do you know someone named T-bird?

268
00:31:17,303 --> 00:31:21,533
He had a friend who shouldn't have
played with knives. Like the coat?

269
00:31:21,783 --> 00:31:24,383
You're the guy
that murdered Tin Tin.

270
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,463
He was already dead.

271
00:31:27,823 --> 00:31:31,823
He died a year ago.
The moment he touched her.

272
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:36,283
They're all dead.
They just don't know it yet.

273
00:31:36,923 --> 00:31:38,803
Get away from there!

274
00:31:38,983 --> 00:31:40,943
Cops!
Get outta here!

275
00:31:42,063 --> 00:31:45,103
Leave it, leave it!
Run!

276
00:31:50,463 --> 00:31:53,143
Oh, great, great.

277
00:31:54,703 --> 00:31:57,223
Guy shows up looking like
a mime from hell...

278
00:31:57,223 --> 00:31:59,543
and you lose him
right out in the open.

279
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:04,853
Well, at least he didn't do that walking
against the wind shit. I hate that.

280
00:32:05,263 --> 00:32:07,623
Little early for Devil's Night.

281
00:32:10,503 --> 00:32:12,463
You are very restless.

282
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:16,343
Just wish I was a little
hungry again, that's all.

283
00:32:16,383 --> 00:32:20,023
- Be careful of what you ask for.
- Yeah, I may get it, I know.

284
00:32:31,463 --> 00:32:34,183
There are energies
aligning against you.

285
00:32:34,383 --> 00:32:36,703
Seeing is believing, isn't it?

286
00:32:47,143 --> 00:32:48,663
Mmm, yummy.

287
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:58,423
Gideon's pawnshop just burned down
to the foundation.

288
00:32:59,023 --> 00:33:01,433
Nobody cleared this
little event with me.

289
00:33:01,683 --> 00:33:02,933
I didn't have nothing
to do with that.

290
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:05,733
You must be awfully disappointed.

291
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:09,143
I got trouble.
One of my crew got himself perished.

292
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:12,103
- Yeah, who might that be?
- Tin Tin.

293
00:33:12,103 --> 00:33:16,103
Somebody stuck his blades in all his
major organs in alphabetical order.

294
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:19,063
Gentlemen, by all means,
I think we ought to have...

295
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:22,463
an introspective moment of silence
for poor, old Tin Tin.

296
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:27,263
You're working for me
tomorrow night, right?

297
00:33:27,263 --> 00:33:29,863
- Whatever you say, I can do.
- Good.

298
00:33:30,023 --> 00:33:32,023
That's very reassuring.

299
00:33:32,783 --> 00:33:35,703
I still ain't heard
why Gideon's burned down.

300
00:33:36,663 --> 00:33:40,563
Is that a natural catastrophe
or act of God or something?

301
00:33:41,023 --> 00:33:43,263
Call it my need to know.

302
00:34:15,023 --> 00:34:16,823
Let go, you creep!

303
00:34:20,703 --> 00:34:22,463
Nah.

304
00:34:22,463 --> 00:34:25,183
You didn't even slow down,
you dickhead!

305
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:29,063
He couldn't have stopped.

306
00:34:29,343 --> 00:34:32,063
He was a buttface.
I could have made it.

307
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:36,583
What are you supposed to be,
a clown or something?

308
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:38,063
Sometimes.

309
00:34:40,423 --> 00:34:44,543
It's more like surfing than skating.
I wish the rain would stop, just once.

310
00:34:46,143 --> 00:34:48,743
- It can't rain all the time.
- Eric?

311
00:35:05,743 --> 00:35:09,933
Don't thank me.
Are we fighting the good fight?

312
00:35:10,183 --> 00:35:13,673
Double homicide a year ago.
No convictions.

313
00:35:14,423 --> 00:35:16,733
Annie...
Look at that.

314
00:35:17,823 --> 00:35:22,293
"We, the undersigned tenants of
1929 Caulderon Court Apartments--"

315
00:35:22,543 --> 00:35:24,033
What is this, a petition?

316
00:35:23,983 --> 00:35:26,533
Big "kick me" sign for a very nice girl
who found herself a cause.

317
00:35:26,783 --> 00:35:30,743
- The cause got her killed.
- She was fighting tenant eviction
in that neighborhood?

318
00:35:30,743 --> 00:35:35,013
Shelly Webster and her nice
rock-and-roll boyfriend, Eric Draven.

319
00:35:36,503 --> 00:35:39,983
The last time you snooped around a case
is when you got put back on the beat.

320
00:35:39,983 --> 00:35:43,873
- I know. Torres keeps reminding me.
- I bet he does.

321
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:54,103
You're going to wind up
working a school crosswalk.

322
00:35:54,783 --> 00:35:56,223
I'm cool.

323
00:35:56,303 --> 00:36:00,343
You didn't get that file from me, okay?
And don't tell me you owe me one.

324
00:36:01,543 --> 00:36:03,133
Ah, I owe you one!

325
00:36:03,383 --> 00:36:04,943
Yeah, right.

326
00:36:05,423 --> 00:36:06,703
Damn.

327
00:36:31,903 --> 00:36:35,373
Tomorrow night
we can get high...

328
00:36:35,623 --> 00:36:38,983
and watch this whole fucking city
burn from that window.

329
00:37:03,063 --> 00:37:05,663
There's a big fuckin' bird over there.

330
00:37:05,663 --> 00:37:07,543
Huh?

331
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:11,283
It's a squab.

332
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:13,583
Come here, bird.

333
00:37:14,463 --> 00:37:16,423
Hey, bird.
Hey, bird.

334
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:18,343
Bird. B-B-Birdie.

335
00:37:18,823 --> 00:37:20,743
Here, birdie, birdie.

336
00:37:21,023 --> 00:37:23,503
Come here, birdie,
birdie, birdie.

337
00:37:26,383 --> 00:37:28,263
Birdie? Hey, birdie?

338
00:37:29,543 --> 00:37:31,143
Here, Funboy.

339
00:37:34,303 --> 00:37:35,943
What the fuck?

340
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:46,063
No, man! Don't do that! You nearly
gave me a fucking heart attack!

341
00:37:46,703 --> 00:37:48,263
Look at him.

342
00:37:48,863 --> 00:37:50,983
Don't sweat it.

343
00:37:53,263 --> 00:37:56,543
It's time for you to take
your bird and leave, freako.

344
00:38:04,303 --> 00:38:07,973
Take your shot, Funboy.
You got me dead bang.

345
00:38:10,563 --> 00:38:15,513
You are seriously fucked up.
Did you look in the mirror?

346
00:38:15,763 --> 00:38:17,923
You need professional help.

347
00:38:21,183 --> 00:38:22,573
Bingo!

348
00:38:22,743 --> 00:38:24,663
He shoots!
He scores!

349
00:38:34,983 --> 00:38:39,073
- Jesus Christ!
- Jesus Christ?

350
00:38:39,323 --> 00:38:41,553
Stop me if you heard this one.

351
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:44,203
Jesus Christ
walks into a hotel.

352
00:38:46,603 --> 00:38:47,803
Ow.

353
00:38:49,343 --> 00:38:52,313
He hands the innkeeper
three nails and he asks...

354
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:55,423
Don't you ever fuckin' die?

355
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:57,743
"Can you put me up for the night?"

356
00:39:02,943 --> 00:39:06,263
- Does that hurt?
- Fuck. Does it-- Fuck, does it hurt?

357
00:39:07,423 --> 00:39:09,023
Oh, God.

358
00:39:09,503 --> 00:39:13,323
Look what you've done to my sheets.

359
00:39:36,663 --> 00:39:38,903
I've got a gun in my pocket.

360
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:43,983
You're happy to see me,
aren't you?

361
00:40:01,103 --> 00:40:04,133
Stay away!
Stay away from me!

362
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:13,623
Look.

363
00:40:16,063 --> 00:40:19,823
Mother is the name for God
on the lips and hearts of all children.

364
00:40:20,423 --> 00:40:23,263
Do you understand?

365
00:40:22,703 --> 00:40:25,103
Morphine is bad for you.

366
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:39,623
Your daughter is out there
on the streets waiting for you.

367
00:41:10,383 --> 00:41:12,063
If I wanted ice,
I would have asked for ice!

368
00:41:12,043 --> 00:41:13,723
Now fill it up!

369
00:41:15,883 --> 00:41:18,203
Fill it up yourself, macho man.

370
00:41:18,223 --> 00:41:20,063
I really need this.

371
00:41:27,503 --> 00:41:28,983
All right.

372
00:41:30,763 --> 00:41:33,143
You burn yourself
playing with matches?

373
00:41:33,103 --> 00:41:35,663
- Fuck off.
- You have an appointment.

374
00:41:35,463 --> 00:41:37,823
- Well, shit on me.
- Drink up.

375
00:41:37,943 --> 00:41:40,703
This is a first.
Do I bow or do I curtsy?

376
00:41:40,823 --> 00:41:43,383
Get my friend here a glass of blood.

377
00:41:44,143 --> 00:41:45,943
Oh! Hey, hey, hon!

378
00:41:45,463 --> 00:41:48,213
Hey, good night, Darla.

379
00:41:52,023 --> 00:41:54,823
You stay put right there.

380
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:05,983
Get away, steamhead.

381
00:42:25,103 --> 00:42:26,343
Shh.

382
00:42:36,503 --> 00:42:40,663
As you can see, I'm on the corner
of 27th and Washington...

383
00:42:42,103 --> 00:42:44,743
the site of last year's biggest
Devil's Night conflagration.

384
00:42:44,743 --> 00:42:47,703
It was exactly one year ago
that the building you see...

385
00:42:47,703 --> 00:42:50,583
across the street from me
was totally demolished by fire.

386
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:52,583
The fire that was fought
by seven fire companies...

387
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,863
but lost the lives
of two fire fighters.

388
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:58,943
In fact, if it weren't for the constant
surveillance by the local police--

389
00:42:59,503 --> 00:43:00,863
Freeze!

390
00:43:02,383 --> 00:43:04,703
Jesus. Don't ever do that, man.

391
00:43:05,743 --> 00:43:07,623
Fuck.

392
00:43:10,243 --> 00:43:11,883
Good likeness.

393
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:15,043
I saw your body, man.
You died. You got buried.

394
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,953
You still have your hat on.

395
00:43:21,263 --> 00:43:23,023
I gotta sit down.

396
00:43:24,063 --> 00:43:25,343
Shi--

397
00:43:25,983 --> 00:43:27,983
Holy Shit.

398
00:43:30,103 --> 00:43:31,423
Say...

399
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:36,693
are you some kind of... ghost?

400
00:43:36,943 --> 00:43:38,183
Boo!

401
00:43:46,063 --> 00:43:49,823
I don't know what I am. I need you
to tell me what happened to us.

402
00:43:52,343 --> 00:43:55,343
You took a six-story swan dive
out of a window.

403
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:59,093
She, ah, was beaten and raped.

404
00:43:59,343 --> 00:44:03,613
Died at the hospital.
Hey, you asked, man.

405
00:44:03,863 --> 00:44:05,863
Come on. Read the file.

406
00:44:06,463 --> 00:44:10,493
Shelly Webster held on
for 30 hours in intensive care.

407
00:44:10,743 --> 00:44:13,143
Her body finally just gave it up.

408
00:44:13,863 --> 00:44:16,463
I saw it.
I couldn't do jack for her.

409
00:44:27,063 --> 00:44:28,983
- Hey.
- Don't touch me!

410
00:44:32,183 --> 00:44:34,103
Hey.

411
00:44:35,443 --> 00:44:36,883
You okay?

412
00:44:36,943 --> 00:44:38,423
I saw her.

413
00:44:41,063 --> 00:44:43,303
I saw her through your eyes.

414
00:44:44,343 --> 00:44:46,383
You stayed with her the whole time.

415
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:50,353
Yeah, well, you got to
understand something, all right?

416
00:44:51,703 --> 00:44:55,683
I was hoping she'd come
out of it, you know.

417
00:44:56,303 --> 00:44:58,863
Give me something I could work with.

418
00:44:59,183 --> 00:45:00,463
Yeah.

419
00:45:02,383 --> 00:45:03,823
Look, I--

420
00:45:03,823 --> 00:45:06,263
Why didn't you do something about it?

421
00:45:06,263 --> 00:45:09,543
You think any people in that building,
even the ones who signed the petition...

422
00:45:09,543 --> 00:45:12,183
would talk after what happened to you?

423
00:45:12,903 --> 00:45:15,223
I kept asking questions and...

424
00:45:16,063 --> 00:45:19,703
finally got busted for sticking
my nose where it wasn't wanted.

425
00:45:22,463 --> 00:45:24,143
This your wife?

426
00:45:24,423 --> 00:45:28,513
Yeah, we, uh-- Well, not anymore,
we're getting a divorce.

427
00:45:30,543 --> 00:45:32,063
It's funny.

428
00:45:33,423 --> 00:45:36,343
Little things used to mean
so much to Shelly.

429
00:45:37,303 --> 00:45:40,103
I used to think
they were kind of trivial.

430
00:45:40,343 --> 00:45:42,703
Believe me,
nothing is trivial.

431
00:45:52,903 --> 00:45:55,983
You shouldn't smoke these.
They'll kill you.

432
00:46:02,163 --> 00:46:04,883
You going to vanish
into thin air again?

433
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:10,663
I thought I'd use your front door.

434
00:46:13,743 --> 00:46:19,223
Look, man, I'm sorry as hell for what
happened to you and your girlfriend.

435
00:46:20,783 --> 00:46:22,063
Yeah.

436
00:46:27,343 --> 00:46:29,943
Yeah.

437
00:46:29,943 --> 00:46:33,143
I got stabbed!
I shot the son of a bitch!

438
00:46:33,383 --> 00:46:36,183
I watched the bullet hole
close by itself.

439
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:39,423
And then my business
gets blown up real good.

440
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:42,223
- Other than that, my day sucked.
- Yeah.

441
00:46:42,663 --> 00:46:45,023
I saw him too.
He had a guitar.

442
00:46:45,143 --> 00:46:49,343
He winked at me before he jumped out
a fourth-floor window like he had wings.

443
00:46:49,423 --> 00:46:52,823
He winked at ya?
Musicians.

444
00:46:54,383 --> 00:46:56,823
- What else did you see?
- So far I haven't heard...

445
00:46:56,823 --> 00:46:59,263
shit about what you're going to do
about all this crap!

446
00:46:59,263 --> 00:47:03,193
What do I get? My livelihood
got flushed and went swirling.

447
00:47:04,663 --> 00:47:06,783
You ain't lost everything.

448
00:47:07,383 --> 00:47:11,643
Yeah, and maybe you're not
such a big shot either! Ow! Jesus!

449
00:47:12,343 --> 00:47:14,333
Fair enough.

450
00:47:14,583 --> 00:47:16,583
Catch.

451
00:47:16,823 --> 00:47:18,343
Aah! Jesus.

452
00:47:19,183 --> 00:47:21,623
Say hello to the last fellow
who wouldn't cooperate with me.

453
00:47:21,623 --> 00:47:23,583
What're you tellin' me,
this thing is real?

454
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:26,863
All the power in the world
resides in the eyes, fella.

455
00:47:27,183 --> 00:47:30,703
Sometimes they're more useful
than the people who bear them.

456
00:47:31,023 --> 00:47:34,383
You're directly out of
your fucking mind! You know that!

457
00:47:36,303 --> 00:47:37,583
Yeah.

458
00:47:37,703 --> 00:47:42,693
Eyes see. It's one of the most important
things I learned from my sister.

459
00:47:42,843 --> 00:47:46,043
Sister? She's supposed to be
your sister?

460
00:47:45,943 --> 00:47:48,463
My father's daughter.
That's right.

461
00:47:49,223 --> 00:47:52,303
What's the matter,
you don't see the resemblance?

462
00:47:52,343 --> 00:47:54,583
Now, let's take it
from the top, friend.

463
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:57,223
With a lot of detail.
What do you say?

464
00:47:58,023 --> 00:48:01,143
He had a bird with him.
Nearly pecked my face off.

465
00:48:01,423 --> 00:48:04,623
He told me to tell T-bird
that death was on its way.

466
00:48:04,743 --> 00:48:06,983
Whatever the fuck that means.

467
00:48:07,323 --> 00:48:10,583
Draven. He said his name
was Eric Draven.

468
00:48:11,623 --> 00:48:13,743
Want to relax that thing now?

469
00:48:13,743 --> 00:48:16,983
This bird man, he just happened
to let you live, huh?

470
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:22,293
You sure you ain't making all this up
just to save your own ass?

471
00:48:22,543 --> 00:48:24,703
I ain't makin' all this up.

472
00:48:25,183 --> 00:48:27,953
I ain't twisted like you two fucks.

473
00:48:31,183 --> 00:48:32,663
All right.

474
00:48:37,743 --> 00:48:41,963
A boy and his bird.
Awful touching.

475
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:44,383
Yeah.

476
00:48:52,343 --> 00:48:55,463
For fuck's sake, die, will ya?
Give me that thing.

477
00:49:01,903 --> 00:49:03,263
Thanks.

478
00:49:04,143 --> 00:49:06,463
Funboy said he saw
a black bird too.

479
00:49:06,463 --> 00:49:07,943
A big one.

480
00:49:09,023 --> 00:49:11,783
Then he choked to death
on his own blood.

481
00:49:13,003 --> 00:49:16,093
I'll have the janitor come on up.

482
00:50:16,783 --> 00:50:18,263
You again.

483
00:50:19,023 --> 00:50:20,863
You lost or hungry?

484
00:50:21,343 --> 00:50:23,103
Hi.

485
00:50:26,263 --> 00:50:28,183
" It can't rain all the time "

486
00:50:28,183 --> 00:50:30,903
" Can't rain all the time "

487
00:50:41,223 --> 00:50:43,863
I don't know how many times
I gotta tell you. We're in this together!

488
00:50:43,863 --> 00:50:46,103
One part falls, it all falls!

489
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:50,143
- You know how long it took us
to put this together?
- Yeah, a long time.

490
00:50:50,143 --> 00:50:52,663
That piece of ratshit made Tin Tin
into a fuckin' voodoo doll!

491
00:50:52,663 --> 00:50:54,503
Tin Tin was a dick.

492
00:50:54,783 --> 00:50:56,543
Tin Tin.

493
00:50:57,703 --> 00:51:00,703
Fire it up! Fire it up!
Fire it up! Fire it up!

494
00:51:01,823 --> 00:51:03,343
Fire it up!

495
00:51:07,303 --> 00:51:08,983
No Funboy.

496
00:51:09,323 --> 00:51:12,643
Probably still...
bangin' away on Darla.

497
00:51:17,143 --> 00:51:19,543
Smokes and road beers.
Be quick.

498
00:51:20,883 --> 00:51:22,363
I'm on it.

499
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:55,663
What the fuck are
you supposed to be, man?

500
00:51:57,623 --> 00:52:00,103
I'm your passenger.

501
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:08,043
Drive.

502
00:52:12,983 --> 00:52:14,783
What's all this happy horseshit?

503
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:17,243
Hey, T-bird! T-bird!

504
00:52:22,063 --> 00:52:25,183
- Oh, shit!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

505
00:52:25,223 --> 00:52:28,833
Stupid asshair!
You hit my car!

506
00:52:35,743 --> 00:52:40,653
What do you want, man?
Money? Drugs? I got it.

507
00:52:41,543 --> 00:52:44,023
We could use you.
You did Tin Tin.

508
00:52:44,423 --> 00:52:47,543
- This is business, right?
- Faster.

509
00:52:50,183 --> 00:52:52,263
You got that cream stuff?

510
00:52:54,263 --> 00:52:57,423
I hate this.
They can't even call it cream legally.

511
00:52:58,103 --> 00:53:01,023
What in the crap--

512
00:53:04,303 --> 00:53:06,893
Oh, look. Makin' us popular.

513
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:09,783
When they flash us like that,
they ain't friends.

514
00:53:15,023 --> 00:53:18,303
This is Vehicle 48. We got us
a big, old, red hot rod.

515
00:53:20,343 --> 00:53:21,623
Turn.

516
00:53:23,663 --> 00:53:26,383
You got something personal, amigo,
we can work it out.

517
00:53:26,383 --> 00:53:28,993
Right? Huh?

518
00:53:32,103 --> 00:53:34,613
Damn! Dead end!

519
00:53:39,663 --> 00:53:42,343
Look out!

520
00:53:45,183 --> 00:53:47,503
Oh, my God!
Get outta the way!

521
00:53:59,243 --> 00:54:02,603
Holy shit!
Goddamn foreign cars!

522
00:54:06,883 --> 00:54:08,403
Shit! Shit!

523
00:54:16,783 --> 00:54:19,223
Oh, I hate this.
This ain't good.

524
00:54:19,703 --> 00:54:22,743
T-bird!
I got you, man!

525
00:54:23,063 --> 00:54:25,103
Shit!

526
00:54:38,223 --> 00:54:40,463
Remember?
Yeah, I remember everything.

527
00:54:40,463 --> 00:54:43,183
But I don't know what--
What? Huh? What?

528
00:54:43,923 --> 00:54:46,193
What are you talkin' about?
No, no, no, no, no.

529
00:54:46,443 --> 00:54:49,483
You mean that place downtown?
Yeah, I remember her.

530
00:54:49,383 --> 00:54:51,293
We needed to put some fear
into that little lady.

531
00:54:51,543 --> 00:54:54,493
She wasn't going along
with our tenant relocation program.

532
00:54:54,743 --> 00:54:58,013
And her idiot boyfriend shows up
and turns a simple sweep-and-clear...

533
00:54:58,263 --> 00:55:01,413
into a total cluster fuck!
Who gives a shit?

534
00:55:01,663 --> 00:55:04,613
It's ancient history!
Why? What do you want?

535
00:55:04,863 --> 00:55:08,913
What is it? What?
Speak to me. Speak!

536
00:55:11,063 --> 00:55:13,503
Did you send us these complaints?

537
00:55:14,503 --> 00:55:17,493
Come here!
"Abashed the devil stood."

538
00:55:17,743 --> 00:55:19,743
Does it get you sweaty?

539
00:55:20,103 --> 00:55:22,103
I know you. I know you.

540
00:55:23,423 --> 00:55:24,893
I knew I knew you.

541
00:55:25,143 --> 00:55:28,933
I knew I knew you.
But you ain't you.

542
00:55:29,183 --> 00:55:33,103
You can't be you. We put you through
the window. There ain't no coming back.

543
00:55:33,103 --> 00:55:36,423
This is the really real world.
There ain't no coming back.

544
00:55:36,423 --> 00:55:38,743
We killed you dead.
There ain't no coming back.

545
00:55:38,743 --> 00:55:41,143
T-bird--

546
00:55:43,143 --> 00:55:46,463
There ain't no coming back!
There ain't no coming back!

547
00:55:48,463 --> 00:55:50,783
T-bird.

548
00:55:52,543 --> 00:55:55,583
"Abashed the devil stood...

549
00:55:55,783 --> 00:55:58,183
and felt how awful goodness is."

550
00:55:58,663 --> 00:56:01,593
"And felt how awful goodness is."

551
00:56:14,943 --> 00:56:17,143
T-bird. T-bird.

552
00:57:05,703 --> 00:57:08,023
This is the 7:00 a.m. edition
of Action News.

553
00:57:08,023 --> 00:57:10,343
For over a decade,
the night before Halloween...

554
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:14,583
has had a darker and deadlier nickname
in the inner city, "Devil's Night"...

555
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:17,903
the name given to what has become
an annual plague of arson.

556
00:57:17,903 --> 00:57:21,903
Last year over 200 blazes were reported,
and 11 people lost their lives.

557
00:57:23,103 --> 00:57:27,683
Tonight may become the biggest
and deadliest Devil's Night ever.

558
00:57:28,183 --> 00:57:31,623
The mayor has firefighters
from all surrounding counties--

559
00:57:31,743 --> 00:57:35,743
Do you like them up or over?
I can't remember.

560
00:57:37,343 --> 00:57:39,983
What are you doing?
I don't even like eggs.

561
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:42,133
Wait, you loved eggs.

562
00:57:42,383 --> 00:57:44,533
Yeah, when I was five.

563
00:57:44,783 --> 00:57:48,023
So what do you want now?
Black coffee and cigarettes?

564
00:57:48,863 --> 00:57:51,983
So what did you take
to become mother of the year?

565
00:57:52,163 --> 00:57:57,273
Oh, it wasn't drugs.
Someone kind of woke me up.

566
00:57:57,523 --> 00:57:58,843
Who?

567
00:57:59,773 --> 00:58:01,973
Oh, it was nuts.

568
00:58:02,923 --> 00:58:07,393
You're acting weird. Did you win
the lottery or something, Darla?

569
00:58:10,463 --> 00:58:14,463
Oh, forget it. I never was
too good at this mommy shit.

570
00:58:15,063 --> 00:58:16,543
Over easy.

571
00:58:18,383 --> 00:58:22,373
I like 'em
over easy... Mom.

572
00:58:33,663 --> 00:58:35,303
Hey, Albrecht.

573
00:58:37,863 --> 00:58:40,743
This is the third hit
in your hood in 24 hours.

574
00:58:40,743 --> 00:58:43,903
We just fished this out of the river.
He's fused to his own car.

575
00:58:43,903 --> 00:58:47,773
- We're gonna have to I.D. his teeth.
- His name is T-bird.

576
00:58:48,023 --> 00:58:49,943
Arson was his specialty.

577
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:51,903
Looks like he zigged
when he should have zagged.

578
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:55,323
- Case closed.
- Bull-fuckin'-shit.

579
00:58:55,743 --> 00:58:57,223
Come here.

580
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,503
You're holding out on me.

581
00:59:03,503 --> 00:59:06,943
I got a goddamn vigilante killer
knocking off scumbags left and right...

582
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:09,503
and you're covering up for somebody.

583
00:59:10,143 --> 00:59:12,583
Who's the cartoon character
in the painted face?

584
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:16,113
- You're the detective. You tell me.
- Okay.

585
00:59:16,383 --> 00:59:18,463
Gideon's blows all to hell and you're
having a chitchat with some weirdo...

586
00:59:18,463 --> 00:59:21,343
who winds up in T-bird's car
when it zigs instead of zags.

587
00:59:21,343 --> 00:59:24,223
Then you steal one of
my case files from homicide...

588
00:59:24,223 --> 00:59:26,143
and you're saying this is just
a fuckin' automobile accident?

589
00:59:26,143 --> 00:59:28,383
- Come on!
- Yeah. Good speech though.

590
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,423
I didn't want to interrupt you.
It sounded good.

591
00:59:30,423 --> 00:59:32,423
You gotta write that shit down.

592
00:59:32,423 --> 00:59:34,343
All right, smart-ass.

593
00:59:34,343 --> 00:59:37,303
The captain's got a little
love note waiting for you.

594
00:59:37,303 --> 00:59:41,143
- Welcome to the first day of the
rest of your suspension.
- Suspension?

595
00:59:41,143 --> 00:59:44,513
- For what?
- Misconduct.

596
00:59:46,823 --> 00:59:49,463
Yeah, give me the lab.

597
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:39,903
One for sorrow,
two for joy...

598
01:00:39,903 --> 01:00:43,063
- Come here.
- ...three for a girl, four for a boy.

599
01:00:47,463 --> 01:00:48,903
Dancing--

600
01:01:21,643 --> 01:01:22,923
Eric?

601
01:01:25,983 --> 01:01:28,743
Man, Sarah, you're going crazy.

602
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,983
Gabriel.

603
01:01:32,963 --> 01:01:34,933
I thought you were dead.

604
01:01:35,683 --> 01:01:37,683
You're not dead, are you?

605
01:02:02,763 --> 01:02:05,363
I knew it was you.

606
01:02:07,363 --> 01:02:09,613
Even with the makeup.

607
01:02:14,743 --> 01:02:16,743
I remembered your song.

608
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:19,343
You said,
"Can't rain all the time."

609
01:02:20,943 --> 01:02:22,943
That is from your song, right?

610
01:02:33,663 --> 01:02:36,663
Come on, Eric. I know you're here.

611
01:02:38,903 --> 01:02:41,453
I miss you...
and Shelly.

612
01:02:45,783 --> 01:02:48,033
Get so lonely all by myself.

613
01:02:50,863 --> 01:02:54,913
The hell with you.
I thought you cared.

614
01:02:55,883 --> 01:02:58,933
Sarah, I do care.

615
01:03:09,103 --> 01:03:11,103
That's him!
That's him!

616
01:03:11,263 --> 01:03:14,293
But he looked different. He was painted
up white like some kind of dead whore.

617
01:03:14,543 --> 01:03:17,493
I seen him. T-bird sent me in
for some road beers, right?

618
01:03:17,743 --> 01:03:19,973
Then he took him away.
But I chased him down.

619
01:03:20,223 --> 01:03:22,733
And he flash fried T-bird
to his fuckin' car!

620
01:03:22,983 --> 01:03:25,733
Aw, T-bird!
Here's to you, buddy.

621
01:03:26,423 --> 01:03:30,273
Maybe we oughta just videotape this.
Play it back in slow motion.

622
01:03:31,463 --> 01:03:35,733
- Fire it up! Fire it up!
- You see the grave?

623
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:38,083
- Empty.
- Fire it--

624
01:03:38,543 --> 01:03:40,213
Grave?
What grave?

625
01:03:40,463 --> 01:03:42,463
What about my fuckin' grave?

626
01:03:42,663 --> 01:03:43,663
Three out of four.

627
01:03:43,943 --> 01:03:46,943
He's working his way back
to this speed freak right here.

628
01:03:47,183 --> 01:03:49,573
It's not fair.
It's Funboy's fault.

629
01:03:49,823 --> 01:03:52,693
That boy was out of control.
T-bird, he came in, he says...

630
01:03:52,943 --> 01:03:56,643
..."Waste them both." And now
this ghost gonna kill my ass next!

631
01:03:59,983 --> 01:04:02,533
This ghost gonna kill my ass next.

632
01:04:02,983 --> 01:04:04,983
- This ghost gonna kill--
- Hey.

633
01:04:06,703 --> 01:04:07,703
That ain't no ghost.

634
01:04:10,383 --> 01:04:12,983
- They have all arrived.
- Watch him.

635
01:04:13,363 --> 01:04:14,913
We might need him.

636
01:04:16,863 --> 01:04:17,863
Ghost gonna kill my--

637
01:04:31,383 --> 01:04:33,383
He like his plain or with onions?

638
01:04:35,223 --> 01:04:37,473
Fine.
Don't talk to me.

639
01:04:38,623 --> 01:04:41,623
When someone's dead,
they can't come back, can they?

640
01:04:42,623 --> 01:04:44,173
That's what I thought.

641
01:04:45,143 --> 01:04:47,613
Are you referring to anyone
in particular?

642
01:04:47,863 --> 01:04:49,863
You'll just think I'm nuts.

643
01:04:50,143 --> 01:04:53,143
Yeah, well, then maybe
they'll have to lock us both up.

644
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:58,573
- You see him too?
- I saw somebody.

645
01:04:59,123 --> 01:05:01,273
Maybe it was your fairy godfather.

646
01:05:02,563 --> 01:05:04,893
Eric didn't come back for me.

647
01:05:05,143 --> 01:05:08,143
He can't be my friend anymore
because I'm alive.

648
01:05:09,783 --> 01:05:12,483
You want a friend to walk you home?

649
01:06:43,103 --> 01:06:44,103
Boys.

650
01:06:45,983 --> 01:06:48,983
It seems our friend T-bird won't be
joining us this evening...

651
01:06:49,383 --> 01:06:51,383
on account of a slight case of death.

652
01:06:52,023 --> 01:06:53,133
You wanna sit down?

653
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:58,333
Well, well, well.

654
01:06:58,583 --> 01:07:00,583
Devil's Night is upon us again.

655
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:03,253
I thought we'd throw a little party...

656
01:07:03,503 --> 01:07:05,903
start a bunch of fires,
make a little profit.

657
01:07:06,703 --> 01:07:08,703
I like the pretty lights.

658
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:14,893
Problem is, it's all been done before.
You see what I'm saying?

659
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:20,373
- That's no reason to quit.
- Wrong. Best reason to quit.

660
01:07:20,623 --> 01:07:22,773
Only reason to quit.

661
01:07:23,583 --> 01:07:26,333
A man has an idea.

662
01:07:28,343 --> 01:07:30,293
The idea attracts others...

663
01:07:30,543 --> 01:07:31,543
like-minded.

664
01:07:32,623 --> 01:07:34,493
The idea expands.

665
01:07:34,743 --> 01:07:37,993
The idea becomes an institution.

666
01:07:39,243 --> 01:07:40,693
What was the idea?

667
01:07:41,943 --> 01:07:43,943
See, that's what's been
bothering me, boys.

668
01:07:44,623 --> 01:07:47,133
But I'll tell ya, when I used
to think about the idea itself...

669
01:07:47,383 --> 01:07:49,683
it'd put a big old smile on my face.

670
01:07:51,123 --> 01:07:52,123
You see, gentlemen...

671
01:07:52,623 --> 01:07:56,073
greed is for amateurs.

672
01:07:57,423 --> 01:08:01,473
Disorder, chaos, anarchy...

673
01:08:02,503 --> 01:08:04,153
now that's fun!

674
01:08:03,903 --> 01:08:05,903
- What about Devil's Night?
- What about it?

675
01:08:07,303 --> 01:08:10,303
I started the first fires
in this goddamn city.

676
01:08:10,703 --> 01:08:13,703
Before I knew it, every charlatan
and shitheel was imitating me.

677
01:08:13,743 --> 01:08:15,743
Do you know what they got now?

678
01:08:17,063 --> 01:08:19,713
Devil's Night greeting cards.

679
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:22,713
Isn't that precious?

680
01:08:24,143 --> 01:08:25,423
Yeah.

681
01:08:26,223 --> 01:08:29,773
The idea has become
the institution, boys.

682
01:08:30,863 --> 01:08:32,863
Time to move along.

683
01:08:32,823 --> 01:08:35,013
You don't want us to do "Light My Fire"
time for the whole city?

684
01:08:35,263 --> 01:08:36,263
No.

685
01:08:37,743 --> 01:08:40,053
No, I want you to set a fire
so goddamn big...

686
01:08:40,303 --> 01:08:43,303
the gods will notice us again.
That's what I'm saying.

687
01:08:43,343 --> 01:08:45,613
I want all of you boys to be able
to look me straight in the eye...

688
01:08:45,863 --> 01:08:49,973
one more time and say,
"Are we having fun or what?"

689
01:08:50,223 --> 01:08:52,223
- Hey, you! What's your name?
- Huh?

690
01:08:52,263 --> 01:08:53,933
Skank!
You don't feel that?

691
01:08:54,183 --> 01:08:57,183
I feel like a little worm
on a big fuckin' hook.

692
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,573
"I feel like a little worm
on a big fuckin' hook."

693
01:08:59,823 --> 01:09:02,823
Well, boy, your mama must be
damn proud of you!

694
01:09:06,383 --> 01:09:08,383
How the hell did that thing
get in here?

695
01:09:10,223 --> 01:09:12,223
Gentlemen.

696
01:09:12,703 --> 01:09:15,703
Let me go! Let me go!
I gotta go!

697
01:09:21,503 --> 01:09:24,933
You're him, huh?
The avenger.

698
01:09:25,183 --> 01:09:27,183
The killer of killers.

699
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:29,663
Nice outfit.

700
01:09:30,503 --> 01:09:32,503
I'm not sure about the face though.

701
01:09:32,503 --> 01:09:34,293
I just want him.

702
01:09:34,943 --> 01:09:36,943
Well, you can't have him.

703
01:09:37,943 --> 01:09:38,943
Well...

704
01:09:42,463 --> 01:09:44,463
I see you have made your decision.

705
01:09:46,303 --> 01:09:48,303
Now let's see you enforce it.

706
01:09:48,343 --> 01:09:51,343
Aw, this is already boring
the shit out of me. Kill him!

707
01:09:57,463 --> 01:09:59,713
Ooh, that had to hurt.

708
01:10:02,903 --> 01:10:04,903
Well, that's that.

709
01:10:04,103 --> 01:10:06,103
That guy was crazy.

710
01:10:13,463 --> 01:10:14,463
He's gone.

711
01:10:22,943 --> 01:10:23,943
Get him!

712
01:10:41,143 --> 01:10:44,043
Right here! Here, help me!
He's gonna kill me!

713
01:10:48,663 --> 01:10:50,213
Jesus Christ!

714
01:11:05,343 --> 01:11:06,583
Hey!

715
01:11:38,783 --> 01:11:40,783
You're all going to die.

716
01:11:55,063 --> 01:11:57,063
Get the fuck outta here!

717
01:12:32,103 --> 01:12:34,733
Guess it's not a good day
to be a bad guy, huh, Skank?

718
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:37,893
I'm not Skank.
There's Skank right there.

719
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:41,653
- Skank's dead.
- That's right.

720
01:12:42,103 --> 01:12:43,103
No!

721
01:12:50,063 --> 01:12:52,063
What in the crap--

722
01:12:52,863 --> 01:12:54,863
- Don't move!
- Hold it!

723
01:12:55,463 --> 01:12:57,463
That's all she wrote!
Move and we shoot!

724
01:13:07,503 --> 01:13:10,503
You are surrounded by police units.
Do not attempt to escape.

725
01:13:13,543 --> 01:13:16,193
- Stop running immediately.
- Holy shit!

726
01:13:17,103 --> 01:13:18,103
...arms and legs--

727
01:13:24,503 --> 01:13:27,753
Stop immediately.
Lie down, spread your arms and legs--

728
01:14:10,023 --> 01:14:12,023
Come on! Move it!

729
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:19,503
My advice:
Next time duck.

730
01:14:21,703 --> 01:14:23,703
So many cops, you'd think
they were giving away donuts.

731
01:14:27,263 --> 01:14:29,263
Shit!

732
01:14:33,023 --> 01:14:35,913
Oh. I knew you were gonna do that.

733
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:37,913
Look at that out there.

734
01:14:38,163 --> 01:14:40,963
The whole city oughta be
in flames by now.

735
01:14:41,923 --> 01:14:43,693
Sky oughta be red.

736
01:14:44,343 --> 01:14:48,093
So that, I take it,
is the late, great Eric Draven.

737
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:53,033
He has power, but it is power
you can take from him.

738
01:14:54,103 --> 01:14:56,733
- I like him already.
- The crow...

739
01:14:56,983 --> 01:15:00,183
is his link between
the land of the living...

740
01:15:00,483 --> 01:15:03,133
and the realm of the dead.

741
01:15:03,703 --> 01:15:07,503
So, kill the crow
and destroy the man.

742
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:09,343
Hmm.

743
01:15:32,343 --> 01:15:34,343
I'm coming home, Shelly.

744
01:16:21,183 --> 01:16:23,293
You're gonna say
I shouldn't be in the cemetery...

745
01:16:23,543 --> 01:16:25,543
in the middle of the night, right?

746
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:27,133
Safest place in the world to be.

747
01:16:27,383 --> 01:16:31,733
It's 'cause everybody's dead.
I knew you'd come here.

748
01:16:33,123 --> 01:16:35,473
It's really late, Sarah.

749
01:16:35,663 --> 01:16:37,663
You didn't say good-bye.

750
01:16:38,863 --> 01:16:40,913
You're just gonna have to forgive
me for that.

751
01:16:42,743 --> 01:16:44,893
And you're never coming back.

752
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:55,063
I gave this to Shelly once.

753
01:16:59,503 --> 01:17:02,153
I think she'd like you to have it.

754
01:17:06,223 --> 01:17:08,223
This way you'll always
remember her.

755
01:17:08,503 --> 01:17:10,503
I'll never take it off.

756
01:17:28,683 --> 01:17:31,083
I better go sneak back
in the house.

757
01:17:38,663 --> 01:17:39,663
Bye.

758
01:17:58,903 --> 01:18:00,903
Shh! Shh!

759
01:18:03,503 --> 01:18:05,503
Shh. Take it easy, sweetheart.

760
01:18:12,463 --> 01:18:13,913
Come on.
Come on.

761
01:18:27,543 --> 01:18:31,593
What is that? Some sort of souvenir
there from your pal?

762
01:18:33,023 --> 01:18:36,023
I'll just keep it for good luck.
What do you say, hmm?

763
01:18:42,223 --> 01:18:44,973
Her eyes are so innocent.

764
01:18:56,223 --> 01:18:57,223
Eric!

765
01:18:58,143 --> 01:18:59,693
Eric, help! Eric!

766
01:19:40,083 --> 01:19:42,083
Quick impression for ya.

767
01:19:42,943 --> 01:19:45,543
Caw! Caw! Bang!
Fuck, I'm dead!

768
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:49,583
Give me the girl and I'll let you
walk out of here.

769
01:19:51,523 --> 01:19:53,023
Well, well.

770
01:19:52,863 --> 01:19:55,863
Why don't you just give me a minute
to think about that, huh?

771
01:20:05,403 --> 01:20:06,603
Nah. Fuck it.

772
01:20:15,383 --> 01:20:16,533
Aw, fuck.

773
01:20:23,423 --> 01:20:27,573
Well, well, well. It does seem to me
that our little life has undergone...

774
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:31,273
a rather significant change in the past
few minutes now. Wouldn't you agree?

775
01:20:36,263 --> 01:20:39,013
Well, for a ghost, you bleed just fine.

776
01:20:42,343 --> 01:20:44,343
- It's still alive.
- Well, then kill it!

777
01:20:46,363 --> 01:20:48,113
Bye-bye, birdie.

778
01:21:31,463 --> 01:21:33,113
Ah, shit.

779
01:21:33,543 --> 01:21:35,543
Well, just came by
to pay my respects...

780
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:37,583
and here you are getting
all shot up again.

781
01:21:37,623 --> 01:21:39,623
- They've taken Sarah.
- How many?

782
01:21:40,223 --> 01:21:41,223
Two more.

783
01:21:42,183 --> 01:21:44,183
I can handle it.
Don't worry.

784
01:21:44,183 --> 01:21:46,183
I'm not worried.
Look, here's the plan.

785
01:21:46,663 --> 01:21:49,093
You stay in front, and when they
run out of ammo, I'll arrest 'em.

786
01:21:49,343 --> 01:21:52,943
That sounds like a great plan.
There's just one problem.

787
01:21:55,463 --> 01:21:58,013
Oh, shit.
You're bleeding all over the place.

788
01:21:58,903 --> 01:22:00,903
I thought, you know,
you were invincible.

789
01:22:00,983 --> 01:22:03,833
I was.
I'm not anymore.

790
01:22:04,983 --> 01:22:07,983
Well, I guess you really will
need my help, won't you?

791
01:22:08,203 --> 01:22:09,203
Come on.

792
01:22:13,863 --> 01:22:14,863
You take that.

793
01:22:44,703 --> 01:22:47,703
- You were supposed to stay behind me.
- I think I messed up.

794
01:23:11,063 --> 01:23:13,763
This is all the power you ever had.

795
01:23:14,303 --> 01:23:16,003
Now it is mine.

796
01:23:16,783 --> 01:23:18,783
Pity there's not more time...

797
01:23:19,983 --> 01:23:21,983
...for us.

798
01:23:39,863 --> 01:23:41,863
Help, Eric!
I'm scared!

799
01:23:45,063 --> 01:23:46,063
Let me go!

800
01:23:56,383 --> 01:23:57,383
Let her go!

801
01:24:00,223 --> 01:24:03,273
You can have me.
I won't fight you.

802
01:24:04,803 --> 01:24:05,803
All right.

803
01:24:05,743 --> 01:24:07,743
No!

804
01:24:52,183 --> 01:24:53,463
Eric!

805
01:25:11,783 --> 01:25:14,383
- Sarah?
- Look out!

806
01:25:20,063 --> 01:25:21,063
Eric!

807
01:25:29,063 --> 01:25:30,973
You know, my daddy used to say...

808
01:25:31,223 --> 01:25:33,223
"Every man's got a devil...

809
01:25:33,703 --> 01:25:35,703
and you can't rest till you find him."

810
01:25:35,903 --> 01:25:37,903
What happened back there
with you and your girlfriend--

811
01:25:38,343 --> 01:25:40,343
I cleared that building.

812
01:25:41,223 --> 01:25:44,173
Hell, nothing in this town
happens without my say-so.

813
01:25:44,423 --> 01:25:46,873
So I'm sorry if I spoiled
your wedding plans, friend.

814
01:25:47,263 --> 01:25:49,713
But if it's any consolation to you...

815
01:25:50,023 --> 01:25:53,073
you have put a smile on my face.

816
01:25:53,583 --> 01:25:55,583
You got a lot of spirit, son.

817
01:25:56,583 --> 01:25:58,583
I am going to miss you.

818
01:25:58,783 --> 01:26:00,783
I have something to give you.

819
01:26:01,263 --> 01:26:03,263
I don't want it anymore.

820
01:26:07,863 --> 01:26:08,863
Thirty hours of pain!

821
01:26:13,023 --> 01:26:15,023
All at once!

822
01:26:16,763 --> 01:26:18,763
All for you.

823
01:26:43,103 --> 01:26:44,383
Yeah.

824
01:26:52,703 --> 01:26:53,703
Go help him.

825
01:26:58,983 --> 01:27:00,233
Are you alive?

826
01:27:03,603 --> 01:27:06,303
God, I need a cigarette.

827
01:27:12,303 --> 01:27:13,403
Everybody else dead?

828
01:27:14,223 --> 01:27:15,673
You helped me.

829
01:27:16,463 --> 01:27:18,663
What you kept in here saved me.

830
01:27:19,023 --> 01:27:21,373
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

831
01:27:22,063 --> 01:27:24,063
I've been meaning to come
to church anyway.

832
01:27:29,743 --> 01:27:30,743
Oh, yuck.

833
01:27:33,163 --> 01:27:36,263
I'm quitting as of now...
if I live.

834
01:27:46,083 --> 01:27:48,533
Stay with him until help comes.

835
01:27:48,983 --> 01:27:51,533
He'll be okay, right?

836
01:27:52,183 --> 01:27:53,463
Eric?

837
01:27:56,263 --> 01:27:58,263
He does that a lot.

838
01:28:14,743 --> 01:28:16,103
Shelly.

839
01:28:29,223 --> 01:28:33,253
- All right, what's going on in there?
- Multiple homicides.

840
01:28:33,503 --> 01:28:35,503
At least it stopped raining, huh?

841
01:28:36,143 --> 01:28:39,213
- It can't rain all the time.
- No, I don't believe it.

842
01:28:39,463 --> 01:28:42,493
- This nightmare your fault, Albrecht?
- Look, you go on home.

843
01:28:42,743 --> 01:28:44,193
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

844
01:28:44,663 --> 01:28:47,663
- Want to tell me what's going on?
- Your vigilante's up on the roof.

845
01:28:49,143 --> 01:28:50,543
You missed it.

846
01:28:51,483 --> 01:28:52,783
Get him outta here!

847
01:29:55,263 --> 01:29:56,263
Thanks.

848
01:30:02,143 --> 01:30:05,093
If the people we love
are stolen from us...

849
01:30:05,343 --> 01:30:10,053
the way to have them live on
is to never stop loving them.

850
01:30:10,103 --> 01:30:14,853
Buildings burn, people die,
but real love is forever.

851
01:30:17,803 --> 01:30:21,853
