1
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,910
Five...

2
00:00:19,993 --> 00:00:22,288
nine, ten, eleven...

3
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:24,247
twelve, thirteen,
nineteen, seventeen...

4
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:26,250
- Arnie...
- fifteen, seventeen.
- Arnie, eat some chicken.

5
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,878
I don't...
I don't want any chicken, Gilbert.

6
00:00:31,504 --> 00:00:33,922
You want some corn?

7
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:36,133
- I want... I want some corn.
- Have some corn.

8
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:40,720
Yeah, here.

9
00:00:42,806 --> 00:00:46,434
- Good?
- Mm-mmm.

10
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:48,519
Not good corn.

11
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:54,775
- Gilbert?
- Hmm?

12
00:00:54,858 --> 00:00:56,360
Are they gonna come soon?

13
00:00:56,443 --> 00:00:59,655
'Cause I gotta go back home,
you know?

14
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:02,950
- Pretty soon.
- I want them to come.

15
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:07,453
- You wanna go home?
- No.

16
00:01:07,536 --> 00:01:09,789
I wanna see 'em.

17
00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:11,790
Okay.

18
00:01:11,873 --> 00:01:14,876
They're gonna come soon, huh?

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,087
How many more miles
till they come, Gilbert?

20
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,381
- Three million, buddy.
- Three?
- Yep.

21
00:01:19,464 --> 00:01:21,424
Okay.

22
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:32,767
Gilbert! That's them, huh?
Gilbert, look, it's them!

23
00:01:33,977 --> 00:01:36,271
Look! Look over there!

24
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:41,609
Over there!

25
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:48,490
Look at them, Gilbert!
They're coming!

26
00:01:53,035 --> 00:01:55,664
Honk your horn!
Honk your horn!

27
00:01:55,746 --> 00:01:59,249
- Arnie, get back here!
- Honk your horn!

28
00:01:59,374 --> 00:02:01,669
- My brother Arnie's about to turn 18.
- Arnie!

29
00:02:01,752 --> 00:02:04,087
- My family's planning
a big party for him.
- Arnie, come on!

30
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,758
Watching the campers
is our yearly ritual.

31
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,804
They're doing the right thing
just passing through.

32
00:02:17,182 --> 00:02:19,560
God, Arnie. You're gettin' so big.
Pretty soon...

33
00:02:19,643 --> 00:02:22,479
- I ain't gonna be able
to carry you no more.
- No.

34
00:02:22,563 --> 00:02:25,398
- You know,
you're getting littler, Gilbert.
- Yeah.

35
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:28,318
You're getting littler.
You're shrinking.

36
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:32,614
You're shrinking, Gilbert.
You're shrinking.

37
00:02:32,697 --> 00:02:35,157
Shrinking, shrinking, shrinking!

38
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,709
Endora.

39
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,503
Endora's where we are.

40
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:52,005
Describing Endora
is like dancing to no music.

41
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,177
It's a town where
nothing much ever happens...

42
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,679
and nothing much ever will.

43
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,600
Lamson's Grocery is where I work.

44
00:03:04,683 --> 00:03:07,519
And miles out of town on the interstate,
there's Foodland...

45
00:03:09,103 --> 00:03:11,272
where everyone else shops.

46
00:03:12,732 --> 00:03:16,277
This is where I live with my family.
My dad built the house...

47
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,362
and it's my job
to keep up the repairs.

48
00:03:22,032 --> 00:03:25,202
Doctors said we'd be lucky
if Arnie lived to be ten.

49
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:27,955
Well, ten came and went.
Now the doctors are saying...

50
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:30,874
"Any time now.
Arnie can go at any time."

51
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:45,386
Some days you want him to live...

52
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:48,431
some days you don't.

53
00:03:48,515 --> 00:03:51,058
- What is it, buddy?
- I killed him.

54
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:58,607
- I killed him, Gilbert.
- I know.
- I killed him.

55
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:01,442
I know, buddy.
I know.

56
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:08,825
My older sister Amy's
more like a mother.

57
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:14,162
She used to manage the elementary
school cafeteria over in Motley...

58
00:04:14,246 --> 00:04:16,247
until it burned down last year.

59
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,835
My other sister, Ellen,
just turned 15.

60
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,590
She got her braces off,
and for days now she's been
walking around going, "Ooh. Ahh."

61
00:04:25,673 --> 00:04:27,757
Like she can't believe
the feel of teeth.

62
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:38,601
I got another brother, Larry,
but he got away.

63
00:04:38,684 --> 00:04:40,853
And then there's Mama,
who in her day...

64
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:43,355
was the prettiest girl
in these parts.

65
00:04:43,438 --> 00:04:46,442
Ever since our dad
was hung out to dry 17 years ago...

66
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:48,318
Mama's had her hands full.

67
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:50,862
You see, with Mama there's
no nice way to break it to you.

68
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:55,033
She hasn't left the house
in over seven years.

69
00:04:58,744 --> 00:05:01,371
- I'm Gilbert.
- Amy, I need your help.
- What is it?

70
00:05:01,455 --> 00:05:04,165
- Gilbert Grape.
- The garbage.

71
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:10,963
- "This is the stuff of the circus."
- Sunshine? Where's my sunshine?

72
00:05:11,047 --> 00:05:13,007
I don't know, Mama.

73
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,801
- Just the essentials.
- Okay.

74
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:22,140
Gilbert, get him down from there.

75
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:25,935
- Arnie?
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

76
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:30,981
- Amy, have you seen Arnie?
- No.

77
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:35,109
- I thought he was with you.
- No. No.

78
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:38,863
- I wonder where he is.
- Gee, I don't know.

79
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:41,491
Ellen, have you seen your brother?

80
00:05:41,573 --> 00:05:43,785
- He's in the tree.
- Ellen!

81
00:05:43,868 --> 00:05:47,205
He is not in the tree.
Gilbert already looked in the tree.

82
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:50,165
Isn't that right, Gilbert?

83
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,793
Yeah, that's right.

84
00:05:52,876 --> 00:05:56,170
Whoa! Arnie.
Don't do that.

85
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:58,507
Don't do that. You scared me.
Come here.

86
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:03,803
- Wait, wait. I was up there, Gilbert!
- Yeah, you were up in the tree.

87
00:06:03,886 --> 00:06:06,012
I was right up there.

88
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:59,644
Can I help you with anything?

89
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:02,480
- No.
- Thank you, and goodbye.

90
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:09,028
- Gilbert?
- Sir?

91
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:11,864
- Is something goin' on at Foodland?
- Well, I wouldn't know, sir.

92
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:15,074
I don't shop there.
I'd rather die.

93
00:07:15,158 --> 00:07:18,202
I'll tell you, Foodland's
up to something if you ask me.

94
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,462
It's those lobsters, isn't it?

95
00:07:27,545 --> 00:07:30,422
Scads of lobsters all in a tank.

96
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:32,716
Am I right?

97
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:35,384
You know,
you shouldn't worry about it.

98
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:39,055
It's just a phase.
People will come back here, believe me.

99
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:42,432
- You think?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

100
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,812
The way you say that makes me think
I'm talking to your father.

101
00:07:55,152 --> 00:07:57,363
- Can I have these two, Gilbert?
- No, just one.
- Come on.

102
00:07:57,446 --> 00:07:59,365
- Can I have these two?
- Sure, go ahead.

103
00:07:59,448 --> 00:08:01,283
Say "Thank you."

104
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:03,576
- Say hello to Mama for me.
- All righty. See you tomorrow.

105
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:07,080
Gilbert? That was Mrs Carver
needing a delivery.

106
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:09,832
Could you?

107
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:15,837
- Hello, Gilbert.
- Hello.

108
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:20,509
- Boys, go on outside.
- But we don't want to.

109
00:08:20,592 --> 00:08:24,303
- Yeah, we don't want to.
- Go play.

110
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:25,639
Okay.

111
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:30,225
Hey! Hey!

112
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,144
Arnie, get back in the truck.
Keep countin', okay?

113
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:37,148
Okay. I was counting.

114
00:09:02,338 --> 00:09:06,258
Five, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...

115
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:18,936
Hey, kids, let's play!
Come on! Look!

116
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,898
We got the trampoline.
Come on, boys. It's fun!

117
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:29,529
The, uh...
The ice cream's gonna melt...

118
00:09:29,613 --> 00:09:32,156
soon.

119
00:09:34,117 --> 00:09:37,578
You're right.
It is melting.

120
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:16,446
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

121
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:18,573
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my!

122
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:20,699
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my God.

123
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:26,580
- Come on up here. I wanna show you.
- I don't wanna do it.
- I don't either.

124
00:10:26,664 --> 00:10:30,667
- You don't wanna do it?
- I want a pool.

125
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,835
- You want a pool?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we want a pool.

126
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:35,588
Come on. Come on up here.
Up, up, up, up, up, up.

127
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:45,556
Gilbert was just making a delivery.

128
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,683
Oh. Oh.

129
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:53,980
Gilbert, come here for a second.

130
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,739
- Here.
- Oh, no, no, no, no. Really, uh...

131
00:11:04,823 --> 00:11:08,410
Oh, no. No, no, here.
I insist. You deserve it.

132
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:13,622
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

133
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,624
- Bye, Gilbert.
- Bye.

134
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,251
Gilbert?

135
00:11:18,376 --> 00:11:22,463
Come by my office.
We need to talk.

136
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,759
Okay.

137
00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:29,303
Arnie?

138
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:45,443
<i>Okay, son, it's a little dangerous
up there. Come on down.</i>

139
00:11:45,526 --> 00:11:48,528
<i>- Arnie, get down!
- "Come on, son."
We've had enough fun for one day.</i>

140
00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:51,823
- "Come on down."
- Hey!

141
00:11:51,948 --> 00:11:55,659
Hey! Hey!

142
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:57,995
Wanna go up there!

143
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,957
- "Son?"
- Yeah?

144
00:12:01,124 --> 00:12:03,959
- "Come on down."
- No!

145
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:06,212
I'm not coming down!
I'm goin' up there!

146
00:12:07,504 --> 00:12:10,173
<i>Son, come on down.</i>

147
00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:12,258
I'm gonna go up there!

148
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:17,639
- Arnie? Arnie. Come on down, buddy.
- Look up here.

149
00:12:17,722 --> 00:12:19,556
Hi!

150
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,518
<i>Okay, son.
Come on down.</i>

151
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:27,021
I'm gonna go up here!

152
00:12:27,104 --> 00:12:31,817
- "Come on, son."
- I'm goin' higher than before!

153
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:35,196
<i>- I'm goin' high!
- "It's gonna be getting dark soon."
Come on down.</i>

154
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,574
- Hey.
- Hey, Bob. Yeah, look it.
Here we go again.

155
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:42,701
Basically, I don't like
to work on carburettors...

156
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:44,829
and I can tell
without gettin' into it...

157
00:12:44,955 --> 00:12:48,082
that that is a complicated unit.

158
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:52,336
l... Now, I understand. I can do it
myself, but I need the part.

159
00:12:52,419 --> 00:12:54,255
Look, let me show you.

160
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:56,673
See, it's this
little guy right here.

161
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:58,968
See, the needle valve
is worn down.

162
00:12:59,093 --> 00:13:03,345
- And I need a new one. Can we order it?
- Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

163
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:07,182
- I can order it.
- I'm goin' up there!
- About how long

164
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:11,270
- Probably a week.
- A week?
- "Don't make us come get you."

165
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:14,355
l... You don't have to come get me!
I'm goin' up here!

166
00:13:16,816 --> 00:13:18,651
<i>Arnie?</i>

167
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:23,488
Whoa! I'm not gonna fall!
Whoops!

168
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:25,616
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

169
00:13:27,117 --> 00:13:29,619
Hey!

170
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:31,746
My shoe done fell off.

171
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:36,501
My shoe done fell off, Gilbert.

172
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:41,672
<i>I know a boy
whose name is Arnie</i>

173
00:13:41,797 --> 00:13:45,842
<i>He's about to turn 18
and have a big party</i>

174
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,553
<i>I know a boy
whose name is Arnie</i>

175
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:54,058
<i>Come on down, buddy.
Come on.</i>

176
00:14:00,898 --> 00:14:03,650
<i>Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom</i>

177
00:14:04,984 --> 00:14:09,197
<i>Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom</i>

178
00:14:11,448 --> 00:14:15,327
<i>Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom</i>

179
00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:18,371
<i>Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom</i>

180
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:20,665
<i>Boom, boom, boom, boom</i>

181
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:24,169
<i>Match in the gas tank
Boom, boom</i>

182
00:14:24,252 --> 00:14:28,047
- Good boy.
- Easy does it, now.
- Come on down, buddy.

183
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,883
- All right!
- Come on down.

184
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:33,176
Come on!

185
00:14:42,643 --> 00:14:45,604
Here we go. All right.
Thanks a lot, Jerry. Really sorry.

186
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:48,482
Good.
Good boy. Good boy.

187
00:14:48,565 --> 00:14:51,318
I'm gonna take him home.
I promise it won't happen again.

188
00:14:51,401 --> 00:14:55,697
Son, we hear this every time.
Then after a couple of days,
he's right back up there again.

189
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:59,783
Yeah, but this is the last time.
Right, buddy?

190
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:03,203
- It's the last time.
- Yeah.

191
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,873
- Come on. Let's go.
- I wanna go back up there again.

192
00:15:05,957 --> 00:15:07,958
Let's go.

193
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:13,921
- I wanna go up there again.
- Arnie, man, good job.
- Hey.

194
00:15:14,004 --> 00:15:16,423
- Don't touch him.
- Whoa! Nice try!

195
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:20,510
- Way to go, Arnie.
Could you do it again for me?
- Get out of here.

196
00:15:20,677 --> 00:15:23,429
- Hey, could you help me out later...
- Yeah.
- with the fridge?

197
00:15:23,513 --> 00:15:26,308
- With the what?
- Something wrong with the fridge.

198
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,893
- The electricity?
- I don't know. Maybe.

199
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:31,186
- All right. I have to get my tools.
- Hi.

200
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,190
I'll see you... I'll just come by later.
Hi. You be careful, all right, Arnie?

201
00:15:35,274 --> 00:15:37,276
Okay.

202
00:15:41,445 --> 00:15:44,490
Don't disappear like that
again on me, okay?

203
00:15:44,574 --> 00:15:47,994
Okay. I disappeared.

204
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:50,829
I disappeared on Mom like that.

205
00:15:50,912 --> 00:15:53,541
- Please don't disappear.
- Just let him go.

206
00:15:53,624 --> 00:15:56,376
- Gilbert, will you bring the milk?
- I promise, Mama.

207
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:59,004
- Good boy.
- Disappear like that.
- Good boy.

208
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:02,256
The food.

209
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:08,094
- Are we ready to talk about the party?
- Sure.
- I'm ready.

210
00:16:08,178 --> 00:16:12,724
Ellen's in charge of decorations.
Get this... purple, orange and green.

211
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:14,517
- Sounds good.
- Theme colours, okay?

212
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:18,395
- That sounds pretty good.
- I'm doing the food, the cake.

213
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,148
Okay.

214
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:23,317
Arnie, I'm making something
very special for you.

215
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,611
- And Mama,
you can supervise everything.
- Mm-hmm.

216
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,571
- Okay with everybody?
- That's disgusting.
- Sounds good.

217
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,408
What about me?

218
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,659
You are the guest of honour.
How about that?

219
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:36,662
Gilbert, what about me?
My party! It's my party!

220
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,663
- What about me?
- You just show up, buddy.
That's your job.

221
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,751
- All you have to do is show up.
- You don't have to do anything.

222
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,169
All you have to do is turn 18.

223
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:47,005
- You know, that just leaves Gilbert.
- Huh?

224
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,673
You're the only one
without anything to do.

225
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:51,760
- Got any ideas?
- Sure he does.

226
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:54,553
- No, I don't. No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

227
00:16:54,637 --> 00:16:58,307
- I'm almost 16,
and I've got pages of ideas.
- Ellen...

228
00:16:58,432 --> 00:17:00,558
She designed a whole cake,
and you haven't done anything.

229
00:17:00,642 --> 00:17:03,895
- Stop it, Ellen. Can it.
- Can I be excused?
- He never does anything!

230
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:07,232
- No!
- Please, can't we just do
something as a family?

231
00:17:07,315 --> 00:17:09,650
- This is no fair, Mom! l...
- Can I please be excused?
- It's my party!

232
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:13,820
- We're planning this as a family.
- It's my party though!
- Is that too much to ask?

233
00:17:13,904 --> 00:17:18,700
So it's gonna be an exact copy of the
one... the original they built in Boone.

234
00:17:18,826 --> 00:17:21,244
- Really?
- Which is no big deal, Gilbert...

235
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:25,373
'cause they're all...
all Burger Barns are built identical.

236
00:17:25,456 --> 00:17:27,458
They're prefabricated.
They just ship 'em out.

237
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,793
I mean, it's so efficient.
It's amazing.

238
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:31,962
In a matter of a couple days...

239
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:34,130
there can be
a whole new restaurant there.

240
00:17:35,257 --> 00:17:37,926
So I was driving past
the building site today.

241
00:17:38,051 --> 00:17:41,971
- You know, it's goin' up right next to...
right down the road from Foodland.
- Right.

242
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:44,640
The general manager was there.
So I says...

243
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:47,308
"Can I fill out an application?"
He said, "You bet you can."

244
00:17:48,352 --> 00:17:50,436
So I did, you know,
and it looks really good. I mean...

245
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,274
I might be wearin' one of them
uniforms, flippin' some burgers...

246
00:17:54,357 --> 00:17:57,526
saltin' some fries.

247
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,696
You never know. It could be the
best thing that ever happened to me.

248
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,659
- Hey! Get...
- What's the matter?

249
00:18:05,742 --> 00:18:07,994
Get out of here! God!

250
00:18:08,077 --> 00:18:10,622
I saw her!
I saw her, I saw her!

251
00:18:11,914 --> 00:18:14,457
- That wasn't nice.
- What? What did I do?

252
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,335
- You know what you did.
- Oh.

253
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:19,171
That's your mother in there.

254
00:18:19,254 --> 00:18:21,339
- Your mother.
- I know.

255
00:18:23,592 --> 00:18:26,094
I don't get you, man.
I just don't get it.

256
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:28,679
- Let's go, buddy.
- Okay.

257
00:18:28,762 --> 00:18:31,141
Come on.

258
00:18:31,224 --> 00:18:33,767
Run, now! Run!

259
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:40,148
- Hey! Bye-bye, Mama.
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye, you guys.

260
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:43,067
- Move, honey.
- Gilbert, you're shrinking.

261
00:18:43,151 --> 00:18:46,153
Shrinking, shrinking, shrinking!

262
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,503
I'm not tired yet, Gilbert.

263
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:06,505
Well, you gotta go to sleep, okay?

264
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,132
Okay. Goodbye.

265
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:11,968
No, it's not goodbye.
It's good night.

266
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:15,138
- Yeah.
- Goodbye...

267
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:18,517
is for when you're going away,
and we're not going anywhere, are we?

268
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,476
I know that.

269
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,686
- Jeez, I know that, Gilbert.
- See you tomorrow.

270
00:19:22,811 --> 00:19:26,815
We're not going anywhere!

271
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:28,943
- Goodbye!
- Arnie.

272
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,787
- You gotta work later?
- Hi, boys.
- Yeah, I do.

273
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,915
- Hi, Arnie.
- Hi there, ladies.
- I gotta come back.

274
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:48,167
- How's Mama?
- She's fat.

275
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:52,255
- Come on, man.
She's not all that big, Gilbert.
- What?

276
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:56,759
Listen, I saw a guy at the state fair
who was a little bit bigger.

277
00:19:56,843 --> 00:19:58,802
A little bit bigger?

278
00:19:58,885 --> 00:20:02,305
- Look, all I'm saying is she's not
the biggest I've ever seen.
- Tucker, she's a whale.

279
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:04,390
- Well, take her out for walk
once in a while.
- Tucker, she's a whale!

280
00:20:04,473 --> 00:20:08,435
- Take her out for a jog.
- Get her out of the house.
- Tucker, she's a whale!

281
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:10,437
- Hey, Bobby.
- Give her a chance.

282
00:20:10,522 --> 00:20:12,815
- That's all I'm sayin'.
- Hi, guys.
- I know.

283
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,235
- How's business?
- Not good. Hey!

284
00:20:16,318 --> 00:20:18,361
Nobody's dying.

285
00:20:18,444 --> 00:20:22,198
There's a clear ladder.
There's a clear corporate ladder.

286
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:25,033
- I mean, this is not...
- That's good.

287
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:27,328
That's a good thing for you to do...
to have that happen.

288
00:20:27,412 --> 00:20:29,705
- If you guys would give it a chance...
- l-l...

289
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:33,125
I just was saying that
it wasn't something that
I should be doing for myself.

290
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,920
Look, they use canola oil, okay?
You know what canola oil is?
You probably don't.

291
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:38,796
- No.
- They probably don't even sell it
at Lamson's Grocery.

292
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,965
- No.
- It's cutting edge.

293
00:20:41,048 --> 00:20:44,218
- It creates a crispier french fry and...
- Well, that's...

294
00:20:44,302 --> 00:20:46,136
and a more unique product.

295
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:49,681
And Burger Barn... Forget Wendy's,
forget Burger King, forget McDonald's.

296
00:20:49,764 --> 00:20:52,893
That's, like, old hat.
Burger Barn's cutting edge.

297
00:20:52,976 --> 00:20:55,227
I mean, l-I could really
stand behind it. There's...

298
00:20:55,311 --> 00:20:58,273
It's an innovative place. You know,
they created the salad bar...

299
00:20:58,356 --> 00:21:02,233
which is now mimicked by every
single fast-food chain in America.

300
00:21:02,317 --> 00:21:04,528
- Yeah.
- They came up with that.

301
00:21:04,653 --> 00:21:08,532
Fifteen different toppings
for each salad,
and two different kinds of lettuce.

302
00:21:08,616 --> 00:21:11,034
And it's, you know,
it's all that you care to eat.

303
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:13,285
- I mean...
- Yeah.

304
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:17,414
You either go from clerk to fry cook
to cook to assistant manager...

305
00:21:17,498 --> 00:21:20,375
of you can go from clerk
to cashier captain...

306
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:22,002
to assistant manager.

307
00:21:22,127 --> 00:21:26,047
And then from assistant manager,
you could go to, uh, manager...

308
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,258
and then regional manager
and then...

309
00:21:37,849 --> 00:21:40,685
Look at the little fellas.

310
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:42,854
You mean my hoppers.

311
00:21:42,938 --> 00:21:44,855
Let's try this.

312
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:46,941
For my friend.

313
00:21:49,777 --> 00:21:51,946
There you go, my boy.

314
00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:54,739
What do you say, Arnie?

315
00:21:54,823 --> 00:21:57,867
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

316
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,623
Gilbert.

317
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,294
This Thursday.

318
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,382
It's our anniversary.

319
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,552
Okay.

320
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:22,140
Hello.

321
00:22:46,286 --> 00:22:49,330
Gilbert.

322
00:22:49,414 --> 00:22:51,332
I'll need a delivery later.

323
00:22:59,923 --> 00:23:02,175
Have a nice day.

324
00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:06,888
Gilbert?

325
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:09,222
Gilbert?

326
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,726
He's behind the chips.

327
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,688
- Delivery, son.
- Excuse me?

328
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:20,108
Delivery. She's gonna be
needin' some help.

329
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:23,068
Yes, sir.

330
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,114
- Is that your bike?
- Yes.

331
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,157
I'll do it, Gilbert.
I'll do it.

332
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:36,873
- Here. Wait a sec.
- I got it!

333
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:43,170
- I did it, huh?
- Look there.
- I did it by myself.

334
00:23:43,253 --> 00:23:46,799
Yeah. Look at that.

335
00:24:01,394 --> 00:24:05,774
- I could go at any time.
- Shh. Arnie. No.

336
00:24:05,857 --> 00:24:08,985
Any time.

337
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,529
Excuse me. Where to?

338
00:24:11,612 --> 00:24:13,406
Oh, just keep going straight.

339
00:24:15,449 --> 00:24:18,661
All right.

340
00:24:18,744 --> 00:24:21,663
My mom... My mom wants me
to become... become 18.

341
00:24:21,746 --> 00:24:25,125
And I'm having a big...
a big party, huh, Gilbert?

342
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:28,503
- Yep.
- When is that party coming?
- Six days.

343
00:24:28,586 --> 00:24:32,464
Six days and my party,
and I'm gonna become 18.

344
00:24:32,589 --> 00:24:36,009
- I'm 18, and you're not invited.
- Arnie.

345
00:24:36,093 --> 00:24:39,096
- Don't be rude.
- Oh, it's okay.

346
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,305
He's just being honest.
I don't mind.

347
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:53,775
- l-I got the groceries!
- All right. Be careful with them.

348
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,445
I got the groceries.
I got 'em, okay?

349
00:24:57,571 --> 00:25:00,031
- Oh.
- Uh-oh, Gilbert.
- No, Arnie.

350
00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:02,533
- Oh, no!
- I'm sorry.

351
00:25:02,616 --> 00:25:04,660
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

352
00:25:04,743 --> 00:25:07,329
- Don't worry about it.
- No, no, I'm really... I'm really sorry.

353
00:25:07,413 --> 00:25:10,875
- This is...
- It's okay.

354
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:14,377
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

355
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:18,047
Are you sorry? No.

356
00:25:18,173 --> 00:25:20,549
I'm not sorry. He's not sorry.
We're not sorry.

357
00:25:20,632 --> 00:25:22,843
Don't be sorry.

358
00:25:22,926 --> 00:25:25,220
I'm not sorry.

359
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:33,227
So I think if we're gonna have
people come that early,
we should have some appetizers.

360
00:25:33,311 --> 00:25:36,313
Ooh, yeah, that'd be good. You know
those little Vienna sausage things?

361
00:25:36,396 --> 00:25:39,566
And you put 'em in grape jelly
and ketchup and make a sauce.

362
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:42,861
- Well, I was thinking...
- I want hot dogs, Mom.
- How about pretzels?

363
00:25:42,944 --> 00:25:46,322
- You know, like those Hawaiian
appetizers that they make with...
- No.

364
00:25:46,405 --> 00:25:49,242
You get pineapple chunks
out of the can and you wrap them...

365
00:25:49,326 --> 00:25:51,869
with little pieces of bacon
and you put a toothpick through 'em.

366
00:25:51,994 --> 00:25:55,664
- How do you cook the bacon?
- In the oven on a pan.

367
00:25:55,748 --> 00:25:58,834
But the bacon's not gonna be crisp if
you bake it in the oven on a sheet.

368
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:01,169
- Yes, it will.
- And nobody wants greasy...

369
00:26:01,252 --> 00:26:03,963
- I want hot dogs!
- No, you-you soak 'em...
- floppy bacon.

370
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:07,466
- Mama, I want hot dogs!
- We're gonna have hot dogs, honey.

371
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:10,469
- Mama...
- I promise, we're gonna have hot dogs.
- What... I want hot dogs.

372
00:26:10,552 --> 00:26:13,513
- The thing about...
- We're gonna have hot dogs.
- every party that I've been to...

373
00:26:13,596 --> 00:26:15,474
- Ellen.
- is that...
- Ellen?

374
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:19,520
- Could you not talk
with your mouth full?
- Excuse me?

375
00:26:19,603 --> 00:26:22,271
You're making me sick.
I'm gonna throw up.

376
00:26:23,814 --> 00:26:26,901
- Oh. Okay, Dad.
- Ellen.

377
00:26:26,983 --> 00:26:29,111
- Sure thing, Dad.
- Will you two cut it out?

378
00:26:29,194 --> 00:26:31,488
- Okay, Dad. Sure thing, Dad.
- That's nice.

379
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:34,783
- Stop it, you guys.
- Don't start.
- Dad's dead, Ellen.

380
00:26:34,866 --> 00:26:37,409
- Gilbert!
- Gilbert!
- I can't believe you said that!

381
00:26:37,493 --> 00:26:40,455
- Shut up!
- Dad's dead!

382
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:42,289
- Arnie.
- Dad's dead!

383
00:26:42,373 --> 00:26:45,417
- Arnie, shh. Arnie...
- Dad's dead!

384
00:26:45,501 --> 00:26:49,420
- It's okay. Stop it now.
- Oh, God.
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!

385
00:26:49,504 --> 00:26:52,048
- Arnie, stop it!
- Calm down, Mama. Don't get upset.
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!

386
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:54,842
- Make him stop.
- Dad's dead!
- Arnie, shut up!

387
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:57,262
- Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead! Dead!
- You're crazy... You're crazy, Arnie!

388
00:26:57,345 --> 00:26:58,720
- Arnie...
- Stop it.
- Arnie...

389
00:26:58,804 --> 00:27:01,598
- Dad's dead!
- Arnie, listen to me!
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!

390
00:27:01,682 --> 00:27:05,101
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!
- Just calm down!
- Stop it!

391
00:27:05,184 --> 00:27:07,813
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Dad's dead!
- That's enough!

392
00:27:07,896 --> 00:27:10,022
- Arnie, that's enough!
- Stop it!
- Dad's dead!

393
00:27:10,148 --> 00:27:13,109
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

394
00:27:13,192 --> 00:27:15,944
- Arnie, be quiet.
- Right now!
- Dad's dead!

395
00:27:16,027 --> 00:27:18,363
I said, stop it right now!

396
00:27:18,488 --> 00:27:21,324
Amy. Amy.

397
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,452
It should be two-by-tens
or two-by-twelves...

398
00:27:23,577 --> 00:27:26,620
and the space
between 'em here is... should...

399
00:27:26,704 --> 00:27:29,540
They're... Right now, it's at two feet,
and this should be 16 inches.

400
00:27:29,623 --> 00:27:31,959
I mean, that's just standard.
And this right here...

401
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:35,879
See this here? Flat flooring?
I mean, flat flooring's like...

402
00:27:35,962 --> 00:27:39,382
Once the wood gets old, you're
just gonna fall right through it.

403
00:27:39,466 --> 00:27:41,384
Yeah, I guess Daddy wasn't
much of a carpenter.

404
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,472
Hey, Gilbert, why did... why did he use
two-by-sixes instead of two-by...

405
00:27:46,555 --> 00:27:48,933
- Tucker!
- What?

406
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:52,269
- Shh. Keep it down.
- Sorry.

407
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:05,198
She's coming.
Hey, she's coming.

408
00:28:24,881 --> 00:28:26,425
- You all right? You okay?
- Yeah.

409
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:29,928
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Thanks a lot for coming.

410
00:28:30,011 --> 00:28:32,931
- Yeah, I'll come by tomorrow
with the wood.
- Great.

411
00:28:33,014 --> 00:28:35,641
Just... Let's keep it quiet.
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

412
00:28:35,724 --> 00:28:37,684
- What?
- Burger Barn. I'm in.

413
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:40,354
- I got the call.
- Oh, oh. Good.

414
00:28:40,436 --> 00:28:43,732
It's not too late, you know.
Good night.

415
00:28:46,693 --> 00:28:50,904
<i>- I think she's asleep.
- "Let's say that you wanna"
slice down zucchini squash...</i>

416
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:54,199
<i>with the electric food dehydrator.
Look at this.</i>

417
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:57,577
<i>- Wonderful.
- Perfect slices each and every time.</i>

418
00:28:57,661 --> 00:28:59,037
<i>- Is that nice?
- Marvellous.</i>

419
00:28:59,121 --> 00:29:01,664
<i>Of course, if you know someone
that can't chew too well...</i>

420
00:29:01,747 --> 00:29:03,542
<i>- Okay.
- Taking corn off the cob.</i>

421
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:05,960
<i>Look at this. We'll just turn
the dial down a little bit...</i>

422
00:29:11,631 --> 00:29:14,634
<i>... freezed corn, and sit there
for hours with a knife.</i>

423
00:29:14,717 --> 00:29:17,554
<i>- Literally hours cutting your corn up.
- Unbelievable.</i>

424
00:29:17,637 --> 00:29:19,639
<i>Of course, for un...</i>

425
00:29:22,391 --> 00:29:25,811
- "Right now, you get the..."
- Gilbert, what are you doing?

426
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:28,230
- Give me that.
- Sorry, Mama.

427
00:29:28,312 --> 00:29:30,315
Jeez.

428
00:29:33,276 --> 00:29:36,154
- Mama?
- Mm-hmm?

429
00:29:36,237 --> 00:29:38,239
I made up that bed for you.

430
00:29:40,116 --> 00:29:42,743
What for?

431
00:29:42,826 --> 00:29:44,871
Well, just in case
you wanted a change.

432
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:48,831
I'm happy right where I am.

433
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:52,293
- You sure?
- Yeah.

434
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:07,640
Here you go.

435
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:13,479
Here you go, Mama.

436
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:15,105
Thanks, kids.

437
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:17,191
- Good night, Mama.
- You're so helpful.

438
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:28,534
- Another ball!
- I took her delivery,
we talked a little bit.

439
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,535
And that was it.
I dropped her off.

440
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:32,288
What's she doing here?

441
00:30:32,371 --> 00:30:34,331
She... I don't know.
She's just sort of here.

442
00:30:34,414 --> 00:30:36,541
- I think their car broke down
or something.
- Another ball!

443
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,835
Come on. You... I can see it
in your face that you're...

444
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,255
- Can we just not talk about this now?
Can we just change the subject?
- Why not?

445
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:46,592
- Do you understand?
- We want a pool.

446
00:30:49,512 --> 00:30:53,557
- Okay. You're tellin' me later.
- I'll tell you everything later.

447
00:30:53,641 --> 00:30:56,476
- Look at those guys out there.
- Gilbert.

448
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,979
They're laughing, they're all happy...

449
00:31:00,063 --> 00:31:02,397
and waving to their friends.

450
00:31:02,523 --> 00:31:06,068
But the next day... and this is
the thing that they don't know...

451
00:31:06,151 --> 00:31:09,905
they could be lying on the slab.

452
00:31:09,988 --> 00:31:12,365
It's kind of, uh, harsh.

453
00:31:14,034 --> 00:31:16,035
But it's kind of fun too.

454
00:31:20,998 --> 00:31:23,250
- Do you ever, um...
- What?

455
00:31:26,336 --> 00:31:28,838
Well, you know.

456
00:31:28,963 --> 00:31:31,924
- Thank you.
- Are you tempted to, like...

457
00:31:33,426 --> 00:31:35,553
wanna fool around with the bodies?

458
00:31:35,636 --> 00:31:38,888
- Oh, Tucker, come on.
- No, I wanted to ask.
I've always wanted to ask.

459
00:31:38,972 --> 00:31:40,724
- That's all right.
- I'm sorry if
it makes you uncomfortable.

460
00:31:40,808 --> 00:31:44,269
- People are very curious about that.
- Because, I mean
if you don't wanna talk about it...

461
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:47,856
The worst thing that we do is we take
the bodies... the grotesque ones...

462
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,650
the really, really ugly ones...

463
00:31:50,734 --> 00:31:54,278
and we make... make jokes about them,
you know, harmless jokes.

464
00:31:54,403 --> 00:31:57,114
Very harmless jokes,
but we come up with some...

465
00:31:57,197 --> 00:32:02,410
- Come on.
- some very good... good jokes
about them, my father and me.

466
00:32:02,493 --> 00:32:06,414
But-But, you know, they're dead.
And, uh...

467
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:09,207
- You know, nobody can see that.
Nobody hears anything.
- Hi, boys.

468
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:11,878
- Hi, Mrs Carver.
- Hello, Mrs Carver.
- Hi.

469
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:14,713
Those jokes don't hurt anybody.
Nobody knows we even make them.

470
00:32:14,796 --> 00:32:17,632
Gilbert, I'm waiting for your call.

471
00:32:17,758 --> 00:32:20,885
Mr Carver, I haven't seen
your mother in church lately.

472
00:32:20,968 --> 00:32:23,053
- How's she doing?
- Fine. She's fine.

473
00:32:23,137 --> 00:32:26,639
Thanks. Bye.

474
00:32:26,723 --> 00:32:28,934
He wants...
He wants to kill you, right?

475
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,978
Do you prefer a bronze casket?

476
00:32:52,455 --> 00:32:54,707
Hey! Gilbert!

477
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:57,626
Hey, can somebody give me
a hand down here?

478
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:00,254
- What?
- Can somebody give me a hand
with the wood?

479
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:06,176
- Hey, Arnie.
- Huh?

480
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:10,180
- You wanna go help Tucker?
- Uh-uh.

481
00:33:10,263 --> 00:33:12,848
Arnie, go help Tucker in the basement.

482
00:33:16,602 --> 00:33:20,147
Arnie, why don't you
go into the basement?

483
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:23,066
- I don't wanna go down there, Gilbert.
- Please?

484
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:26,903
No way! No way! No way!
You!

485
00:33:26,986 --> 00:33:30,907
- Go down there, Gilbert.
- Is there a problem?

486
00:33:31,032 --> 00:33:33,826
Gilbert? Hey!

487
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:36,453
Dad's in there!

488
00:33:40,164 --> 00:33:43,126
Dad's in there!

489
00:33:43,209 --> 00:33:45,544
Arnie, shut up!
Arnie!

490
00:33:51,216 --> 00:33:53,218
Shut up! Shut up!

491
00:33:59,056 --> 00:34:01,058
Come on! Arnie.

492
00:34:04,437 --> 00:34:07,732
Arnie!

493
00:34:07,857 --> 00:34:09,691
It's not funny!

494
00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:11,776
Get back here!

495
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:18,241
Don't worry.
Those are two-by-sixes.

496
00:34:18,324 --> 00:34:22,202
You know, there's six of'em,
so, you know, those could hold anybody.

497
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,878
- l-I forgot.
- What?

498
00:34:36,298 --> 00:34:38,425
I forgot that
that was where your dad...

499
00:34:41,928 --> 00:34:44,347
Yep.

500
00:34:44,473 --> 00:34:46,475
I'm-I'm sorry.

501
00:34:48,017 --> 00:34:50,561
No, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.

502
00:34:57,942 --> 00:35:00,737
- No, Arnie! No! No climbing!
- I wanna go up there!

503
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,198
Arnie! No, you're not!

504
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:06,076
Arnie! Not again!

505
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:08,702
- Arnie!
- I wanna go up there!
- Get down. Get down.

506
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:10,788
Get down!

507
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,668
You're not going anywhere!
Not too much fun, is it?

508
00:35:16,752 --> 00:35:18,920
I wanna go up there!

509
00:35:21,214 --> 00:35:24,966
No! We're going home!

510
00:35:26,218 --> 00:35:29,262
We're going home.
Come on.

511
00:35:29,346 --> 00:35:31,347
- Stop!
- Ellen, no! Stop it!

512
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,600
- Stop it!
- I told you, don't touch him.

513
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:35,684
- What am I supposed to do?
- Don't ever touch him again.
- He was climbing again!

514
00:35:35,768 --> 00:35:39,271
I don't care. Just get out of here.
Get out of here!

515
00:35:39,355 --> 00:35:41,981
Let me see, buddy.
Come on. Let me see.

516
00:35:42,065 --> 00:35:45,527
Let me see. Oh, great.
You made him bleed!

517
00:35:47,863 --> 00:35:50,281
What does Gilbert say?

518
00:35:50,365 --> 00:35:52,784
If anybody ever hits you...

519
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:55,911
or even just lays a finger on you,
what are you gonna do?

520
00:35:55,994 --> 00:35:58,331
Arnie?

521
00:35:58,414 --> 00:36:00,416
Hmm?

522
00:36:00,499 --> 00:36:04,461
You're gonna tell me, and then I'm
gonna take care of it for you, right?

523
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:07,213
And why will I take care of it?

524
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,173
- Gilbert.
- Hmm?

525
00:36:09,257 --> 00:36:11,801
- Because you're Gilbert.
- Because I'm Gilbert.

526
00:36:11,926 --> 00:36:14,178
Because nobody hurts Arnie,
right?

527
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:19,349
Okay. You wanna pick out some candy?

528
00:36:25,188 --> 00:36:27,815
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- What do you want?

529
00:36:27,898 --> 00:36:30,568
We've got to keep
a closer eye on him.

530
00:36:30,651 --> 00:36:33,528
- What?
- We've gotta do better.

531
00:36:33,611 --> 00:36:35,614
Are you listening to me?

532
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:42,120
- Mine.
- And you.

533
00:36:42,203 --> 00:36:44,121
- Huh?
- You have to stay here.

534
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:48,000
You stay right on this porch.
You don't go anywhere.

535
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:51,545
- Don't go anywhere.
- Don't go anywhere.

536
00:36:51,712 --> 00:36:56,425
We're not going anywhere, Gilbert.
We're not going anywhere, you know?

537
00:36:56,508 --> 00:37:00,761
We're not going anywhere.
We're not going anywhere.

538
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:03,056
We're not going...
We're not going anywhere.

539
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:08,351
We're not going anywhere!
We're not going anywhere!

540
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,394
Gilbert, we're not going anywhere.

541
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:15,399
We're not going anywhere!
We're not going anywhere.

542
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,527
Where are you going?

543
00:38:21,876 --> 00:38:23,669
Hey!

544
00:38:23,752 --> 00:38:27,047
I'm waiting.
Waitin' for that call, Gilbert.

545
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,924
Hey!

546
00:38:31,844 --> 00:38:34,095
Hi, Gilbert.

547
00:38:42,061 --> 00:38:44,271
- Oh, look. Come here.
- What?

548
00:38:44,354 --> 00:38:47,107
- It's a praying mantis.
- Oh.

549
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:51,110
You know how they mate? The male
will sneak up on the female...

550
00:38:51,193 --> 00:38:53,237
and she'll bite off his head...

551
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,740
and the rest of his body
will keep on mating.

552
00:38:55,865 --> 00:38:57,992
And then when they're done...

553
00:38:58,075 --> 00:39:00,118
she'll eat him.

554
00:39:00,201 --> 00:39:02,204
She'll eat the rest of him.

555
00:39:03,371 --> 00:39:07,709
Grandma, we have company.
So, do you want to eat?

556
00:39:10,711 --> 00:39:12,922
- Help yourself.
- Oh, thank you. Wow.

557
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:19,970
Well, we missed the rally
in Des Moines.

558
00:39:21,637 --> 00:39:25,141
If we get on the road by Friday,
we'll be able to make Colorado Springs
in time to catch them.

559
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:28,519
Have you ever been to Colorado?

560
00:39:28,603 --> 00:39:30,438
No, ma'am.

561
00:39:30,562 --> 00:39:32,439
It must be wonderful.

562
00:39:32,522 --> 00:39:34,483
It must be incredibly
frustrating then...

563
00:39:34,566 --> 00:39:37,110
to be stuck here in this place,
in Endora.

564
00:39:37,194 --> 00:39:39,946
This place
is as good a place as any.

565
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,323
Think so?

566
00:39:42,406 --> 00:39:44,617
She should know.

567
00:39:44,742 --> 00:39:47,370
Becky's been just about
everywhere there is to go.

568
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:49,371
Places I didn't even know existed.

569
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:52,665
I'm a worldly kind of girl.

570
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:59,713
Me, I spent most of my whole life
in the same spot.

571
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,382
Why doesn't matter.

572
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:05,009
Anyway, she encouraged me
to get out.

573
00:40:05,093 --> 00:40:07,262
Now she can't stay put anywhere.

574
00:40:10,598 --> 00:40:13,768
She's the smartest,
most beautiful girl in the world.

575
00:40:13,851 --> 00:40:15,811
Isn't she?
Isn't she beautiful?

576
00:40:15,895 --> 00:40:18,480
Isn't she beautiful?

577
00:40:21,401 --> 00:40:24,986
I'm sorry. She has this thing
with beauty that...

578
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,489
Oh, yeah, I noticed that.

579
00:40:27,614 --> 00:40:31,910
I'm not into that... that whole
external beauty thing, you know.

580
00:40:31,993 --> 00:40:35,329
- 'Cause it... it doesn't last.
- Right.

581
00:40:35,413 --> 00:40:38,916
You're, you know... Eventually,
your face is gonna get wrinkly...

582
00:40:38,998 --> 00:40:42,585
- you'll get grey hair...
- Sure.
- your boobs might sag.

583
00:40:42,669 --> 00:40:44,963
You know? So what?

584
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:48,049
It's what you do
that really matters.

585
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:50,676
- Right?
- Yeah, sure.

586
00:40:50,759 --> 00:40:52,803
So what do you wanna do?

587
00:40:54,138 --> 00:40:57,432
Oh, uh, I don't know. I mean,
there's not so much to do here, really.

588
00:40:59,184 --> 00:41:03,980
You can think of one thing.
Think of one thing that people do here.

589
00:41:05,898 --> 00:41:08,191
Um...

590
00:41:08,316 --> 00:41:10,360
Thank you.

591
00:41:10,444 --> 00:41:12,446
It was nice meeting you.

592
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:15,699
Be nice.

593
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:22,747
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi.

594
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:33,964
Can I have yours
and I'll give you mine instead?

595
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,593
No, we want the big one!

596
00:41:37,676 --> 00:41:40,263
You know something?
The one on top of it is fine.

597
00:41:40,347 --> 00:41:44,724
- No, we want the big one!
- Yeah, I like it.

598
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:46,852
- Let's go.
- Come on! Get us the big one!

599
00:41:46,977 --> 00:41:50,063
- Come on, Mom. Please?
- Here you go, guys.
- l...

600
00:41:50,146 --> 00:41:52,523
- We want the big one.
- Yeah, that's fine.

601
00:41:54,649 --> 00:41:58,820
It's changing.
That's what's wild about the sunset.

602
00:41:58,904 --> 00:42:03,617
It'll just change really,
really slowly in front of your eyes.

603
00:42:09,705 --> 00:42:12,541
I love the sky.

604
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:16,169
It's so limitless.

605
00:42:17,338 --> 00:42:20,131
It is big.
It's very big.

606
00:42:20,215 --> 00:42:22,091
Big doesn't even sum it up right.

607
00:42:22,174 --> 00:42:24,594
That-That word "big" is so small.

608
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:27,555
You'd have to get
those really giant words...

609
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:30,057
to describe the sky.

610
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:34,561
Oh. Um...

611
00:42:34,645 --> 00:42:36,813
What?

612
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,776
I have to go do this thing.
It's kind of a family thing.

613
00:42:41,901 --> 00:42:45,029
Do you want me to give you a ride
back into town, or do you wanna...

614
00:42:45,113 --> 00:42:47,948
No, actually,
I'm just gonna sit here.

615
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:55,497
I could come back. I mean, I can...
I can come back and...

616
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,082
- Really?
- Yeah. Will you... You'll be here then?

617
00:42:58,249 --> 00:43:00,292
- Yeah.
- All right.
- I'll just sit here.

618
00:43:00,376 --> 00:43:02,169
All right, I'll be...
I'll be back in a little bit.

619
00:43:02,253 --> 00:43:04,714
- Okay.
- Okay.

620
00:43:07,132 --> 00:43:09,676
- Gilbert.
- Hey, buddy. Come on. We gotta go.

621
00:43:09,759 --> 00:43:11,761
Gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta go.

622
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:16,890
- Gilbert, where's the duck?
- Where's the duck?
- I can't see the duck anywhere.

623
00:43:16,974 --> 00:43:20,269
- Find him. Look. Where'd he go?
- Where's the duck?

624
00:43:20,352 --> 00:43:23,813
- It's hiding. Find the duck.
- Arnie, I don't have time for this.

625
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:26,191
Lift up. Okay, good.

626
00:43:26,275 --> 00:43:29,360
- Ducky.
- Good boy. You know what?

627
00:43:29,444 --> 00:43:31,904
- You're such a big boy.
- Yeah.

628
00:43:31,988 --> 00:43:34,656
- You're such a big boy.
- I'm a big boy.
- Hey, you know what?

629
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,367
I bet you could do this all
by yourself if you really wanted to.

630
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,246
- Could you do this by yourself?
- I'm a big boy.

631
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,206
- Yeah, be a big boy.
- Big boy.

632
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,460
- Okay, take this.
- Take this.
- Wash everything.

633
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:49,420
- Your towels are there...
- Okay.
- and your robe is there.

634
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:50,670
- Okay.
- Okay?

635
00:43:50,754 --> 00:43:54,257
- The big boy's gonna wash himself.
- Right. Okay.

636
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:56,468
- I gotta go.
- Okay.
- Gotta go.

637
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:01,847
- You missed it.
- What did I miss?

638
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,224
- The sunset.
- Really?

639
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,852
- It was beautiful.
- Oh.

640
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,937
Oh, well.

641
00:44:12,398 --> 00:44:15,401
I'd like to see where you live.

642
00:44:15,526 --> 00:44:19,447
- No, you wouldn't.
- Let's go see where you live.

643
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,490
Come on.

644
00:44:28,121 --> 00:44:30,374
My parents split up
when I was a kid.

645
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:34,378
I go back and forth between them...

646
00:44:34,461 --> 00:44:37,380
'cause they're always moving.

647
00:44:37,463 --> 00:44:40,633
But it's good.
It's my life.

648
00:44:41,842 --> 00:44:44,428
Yeah

649
00:44:44,512 --> 00:44:46,596
We don't really move.

650
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,682
I mean, we'd like to, but...

651
00:44:50,517 --> 00:44:53,102
my mom is sort of
attached to the house.

652
00:44:54,395 --> 00:44:56,981
Attached is, I guess,
not the right word.

653
00:44:57,064 --> 00:44:59,440
She's pretty much wedged in.

654
00:44:59,524 --> 00:45:04,153
- What do you mean?
- That's it. That's the house.

655
00:45:07,031 --> 00:45:09,117
It's really amazing.

656
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,286
I mean, how small it looks
from here, considering the...

657
00:45:14,037 --> 00:45:16,248
the girth of what's inside of it.

658
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:23,879
I don't know.

659
00:45:23,963 --> 00:45:27,383
Did you ever see
a beached whale on television?

660
00:45:27,466 --> 00:45:29,427
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

661
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:32,471
That's her.
That's my mom.

662
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:40,561
What about your dad?

663
00:45:40,644 --> 00:45:43,939
Some other day.
Some other day.

664
00:45:57,451 --> 00:45:59,996
I had a nice time tonight.

665
00:46:01,788 --> 00:46:04,041
I know.

666
00:46:07,169 --> 00:46:09,171
- Good night.
- Good night.

667
00:46:54,002 --> 00:46:57,172
Oh, no. Oh, no.

668
00:46:57,255 --> 00:47:00,341
Oh, Arnie. Come on.
I'm sorry, buddy. Come on.

669
00:47:03,344 --> 00:47:06,764
Here, here.
You're okay. You're okay.

670
00:47:06,847 --> 00:47:09,683
You're okay.
You're okay, buddy.

671
00:47:09,808 --> 00:47:11,518
Come on. Get warm.

672
00:47:11,601 --> 00:47:15,063
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, buddy.

673
00:47:15,146 --> 00:47:18,108
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

674
00:47:18,191 --> 00:47:20,734
Would somebody please explain?

675
00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:25,406
- Gilbert's in charge of bathing.
- I could have "drownded."

676
00:47:25,489 --> 00:47:27,783
I could have "drownded."

677
00:47:27,908 --> 00:47:30,284
- No more baths.
- But you didn't, honey.

678
00:47:30,368 --> 00:47:35,665
- You could've, but you didn't.
- No more baths, Mama.

679
00:47:35,748 --> 00:47:39,085
It is too much to ask
to see this boy turn 18?

680
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:42,212
- No.
- It's ready.

681
00:47:42,337 --> 00:47:44,798
Where's your head lately, Gilbert?

682
00:47:44,881 --> 00:47:48,802
Where is your head?
Gilbert?

683
00:47:48,885 --> 00:47:52,346
- Sorry, Mama.
- Sorry isn't good enough.

684
00:47:52,513 --> 00:47:56,684
- You gotta do better.
- Gotta do better.

685
00:47:59,102 --> 00:48:01,604
Hey, boss, is that the right price?

686
00:48:02,939 --> 00:48:04,941
That's right.

687
00:48:05,025 --> 00:48:08,694
- It seems like it ought to be more.
- Maybe at Foodland.

688
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:12,114
We've always had
a reasonable deal on pickles.

689
00:48:12,197 --> 00:48:14,198
Here.

690
00:48:16,285 --> 00:48:18,286
Gilbert, got a delivery
for you, son.

691
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:20,372
It sounds urgent.

692
00:48:30,882 --> 00:48:33,425
Uh, get out.
Go outside and play, right now.

693
00:48:33,508 --> 00:48:36,303
- But...
- Right now. Hurry up.

694
00:48:44,644 --> 00:48:46,937
- Hi, Betty.
- Hi.

695
00:48:49,064 --> 00:48:51,690
Gilbert, could you dial that number
over there for me?

696
00:48:51,775 --> 00:48:55,319
- My hands are all...
- Oh, yeah, sure.

697
00:48:55,402 --> 00:48:57,822
- How have you been?
- Good.

698
00:48:57,906 --> 00:49:00,824
I saw you last night.

699
00:49:00,908 --> 00:49:03,535
Who's the girl?

700
00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:07,080
- It's ringing.
- I got... Sorry. One sec.

701
00:49:08,915 --> 00:49:11,376
This is good. Taste.

702
00:49:11,459 --> 00:49:13,336
That's good. It's, uh, ringing.

703
00:49:13,419 --> 00:49:15,254
One second.

704
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,549
Hello? Ken Carver here,
Carver Insurance.

705
00:49:19,633 --> 00:49:24,638
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

706
00:49:24,721 --> 00:49:27,556
- Mr Carver?
- "Who is this?"

707
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,978
- Uh, it's Gilbert.
- Gilbert!

708
00:49:32,061 --> 00:49:35,064
- "I'd given up on you, Gilbert."
- Did you?

709
00:49:35,147 --> 00:49:37,941
- "Well, yeah. Can you blame me?"
- No, no.

710
00:49:38,024 --> 00:49:41,987
I mean, how many times do I have
to ask, and still no visit?

711
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:44,572
- Well, I'm here now.
- Happy anniversary.

712
00:49:44,656 --> 00:49:46,907
<i>Well, we can't discuss this
over the phone. I think it's best...</i>

713
00:49:46,991 --> 00:49:49,827
that we meet man to man,
don't you agree?

714
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:52,246
- Yes.
- "Today is your lucky day."

715
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:55,582
I've just had a cancellation.
What about right now? Are you free?

716
00:49:59,585 --> 00:50:01,462
Is that a yes, Gilbert?

717
00:50:01,546 --> 00:50:03,964
- "Huh?"
- Okay.
- "All right."

718
00:50:04,047 --> 00:50:05,967
I'm gonna be waiting
here for you, Gilbert.

719
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:08,969
Bye.

720
00:50:09,052 --> 00:50:11,930
Do you want me to be killed?
Do you want him to kill me?

721
00:50:12,055 --> 00:50:15,224
Just playing.
Don't-Don't you wanna play?

722
00:50:15,308 --> 00:50:18,352
This is crazy.
I, uh... I've gotta go.

723
00:50:18,436 --> 00:50:20,895
- You don't have to go.
- Yes, I do.

724
00:50:20,979 --> 00:50:24,357
Hey!

725
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:26,986
It's that new girl, isn't it?

726
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:29,779
No, it's your husband. He wants me
to come to his office right now.

727
00:50:30,946 --> 00:50:33,950
If you walk out that door...

728
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:36,368
Don't you dare walk out that door.

729
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:04,269
You look nervous, Gilbert.

730
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:06,395
I'd be nervous too if I were you.

731
00:51:07,688 --> 00:51:10,816
If I were in your situation,
I'd be downright panicky.

732
00:51:12,525 --> 00:51:15,237
I reviewed your file.

733
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,489
You've got
no major medical insurance.

734
00:51:18,657 --> 00:51:21,368
No catastrophic, no life.

735
00:51:23,035 --> 00:51:25,746
Gilbert...

736
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:29,540
what if something
were to happen to you?

737
00:51:29,624 --> 00:51:32,169
Something unforeseeable?

738
00:51:32,252 --> 00:51:34,837
Something sudden? Random?

739
00:51:36,255 --> 00:51:39,883
An accident, maybe.
What about your family?

740
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:44,221
Do you ever think about your family?

741
00:51:45,807 --> 00:51:48,642
Now, stop thinking about yourself.
Think about them.

742
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:54,021
You don't wanna leave 'em
empty-handed.

743
00:51:54,105 --> 00:51:56,649
Ken Carver here.

744
00:51:56,732 --> 00:51:58,734
Look, can't this wait?
I'm in the middle...

745
00:52:00,151 --> 00:52:05,156
Oh. Betty, please, calm down.
Calm down.

746
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,660
No, no. l-l...
No, go on.

747
00:52:08,743 --> 00:52:10,744
Go on, go on.

748
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:15,040
No. No.

749
00:52:24,215 --> 00:52:26,175
No, no. Calm...

750
00:52:26,301 --> 00:52:28,261
I'll... I'm on my way.

751
00:52:33,766 --> 00:52:36,184
Troubles at home.
I'm sure you understand.

752
00:52:37,311 --> 00:52:39,855
Oh, damn.
Betty's got the car.

753
00:52:39,938 --> 00:52:42,940
Gilbert, would you give me a ride?

754
00:53:03,792 --> 00:53:05,961
Oh, my God! Betty!

755
00:53:06,045 --> 00:53:08,213
What the hell's going on here?

756
00:53:08,296 --> 00:53:11,258
Todd? Doug?
Betty, what is going on here?

757
00:53:11,342 --> 00:53:14,677
I don't believe this!

758
00:53:14,761 --> 00:53:18,972
Oh, great!
Oh, God!

759
00:53:19,056 --> 00:53:20,642
Boys, come on.
Let's...

760
00:53:20,725 --> 00:53:23,644
Let's go show your mom the cookies
that she's baked for us.

761
00:53:24,895 --> 00:53:26,355
This is great.

762
00:53:28,856 --> 00:53:30,859
All right.
Everything's okay.

763
00:53:30,943 --> 00:53:33,778
These aren't burned.

764
00:53:33,861 --> 00:53:37,323
Look, honey, they're fine.
They taste fine.

765
00:53:37,406 --> 00:53:40,158
They're a little burnt on top,
but just fine.

766
00:53:40,241 --> 00:53:43,119
They're wonderful.

767
00:53:43,203 --> 00:53:46,080
Boys, here.
Have some of Mom's cookies.

768
00:53:46,163 --> 00:53:47,958
They're really good. Here.

769
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:50,209
Come on, boys.
Make your mother happy.

770
00:53:50,292 --> 00:53:53,587
Make your mom happy.
Have some cookies. Please. Please.

771
00:53:53,671 --> 00:53:56,464
- Hey.
- Go on!

772
00:53:56,547 --> 00:53:59,884
- What are you doing?
- I could've had any guy. Any guy!
- You want a real pool?

773
00:53:59,968 --> 00:54:03,012
- What do you think this is?
- But...
- Doug, come over here!

774
00:54:03,137 --> 00:54:05,723
- What?
- I chose you.
- It is a pool, son!

775
00:54:05,807 --> 00:54:08,893
- I chose you.
- I got you a real pool, for God's sake!

776
00:54:08,977 --> 00:54:11,270
Look! There's water in here!

777
00:54:11,353 --> 00:54:13,897
Come here! Come here!
Get over here!

778
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:16,941
Come here!
Get inside the pool!

779
00:54:17,024 --> 00:54:19,945
Get inside the pool with your brother!
Come here!

780
00:54:20,028 --> 00:54:22,530
- Why did you?
- Get inside the pool!

781
00:54:22,613 --> 00:54:25,366
Yeah. Look.
Real water, boys.

782
00:54:25,449 --> 00:54:27,993
Okay, so I don't...

783
00:54:28,076 --> 00:54:30,996
- Because...
- I give you all I have,
for Christ's sake!

784
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:33,748
- I knew you'd always be there.
- I've given you everything!
- Because...

785
00:54:33,831 --> 00:54:38,377
- Here's a pool!
- Because I knew you'd never leave.
- A trampoline!

786
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:41,046
What the hell else more do you want?

787
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:43,841
What? For God's sake!

788
00:54:46,385 --> 00:54:49,679
Son, get back in the pool.
Get back in the pool!

789
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:54,308
We're all gonna enjoy it!
It's a lot of fun, isn't it?

790
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:58,312
I'm doin' the best I can here.
I can't do any better!

791
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:01,648
I can't give any more!
I've given enough already!

792
00:55:13,993 --> 00:55:16,162
<i>l- l-I guess maybe
I'd better be getting off.</i>

793
00:55:16,287 --> 00:55:19,331
<i>Not yet.</i>

794
00:55:19,414 --> 00:55:22,292
- "Arthur, in all my life..."
- Move, Amy.

795
00:55:22,417 --> 00:55:25,461
<i>I wondered, where is he?</i>

796
00:55:27,505 --> 00:55:30,674
<i>Just this moment, just now.</i>

797
00:55:32,176 --> 00:55:36,346
<i>What is he looking at?
What is he thinking?</i>

798
00:55:36,429 --> 00:55:38,890
I think it's time for Arnie
to take a bath.

799
00:55:38,973 --> 00:55:41,809
No!

800
00:55:41,893 --> 00:55:45,021
Don't you think it's time
for Arnie to take a bath, Gilbert?

801
00:55:45,104 --> 00:55:47,356
Just let him stink.

802
00:55:47,439 --> 00:55:50,567
- I don't wanna take a bath!
- Please.
- No!

803
00:55:50,651 --> 00:55:53,362
You know Mr Carver?

804
00:55:54,488 --> 00:55:56,489
Well, he's dead.

805
00:55:59,117 --> 00:56:01,244
He's dead.

806
00:56:13,629 --> 00:56:15,548
Okay, kids, hurry up.
Let's go.

807
00:56:18,717 --> 00:56:21,345
- Hi.
- Hey.

808
00:56:23,805 --> 00:56:26,308
- What's going on?
- He drowned.

809
00:56:28,393 --> 00:56:30,645
- You're kidding?
- No. In that.

810
00:56:33,814 --> 00:56:37,484
- A kiddie pool. I don't get it.
- Wow.

811
00:56:37,609 --> 00:56:39,403
It's like one foot deep.
Weird, right?

812
00:56:39,486 --> 00:56:42,781
- Oh, yeah.
- He-He "drownded."
- Shh, shh, shh.

813
00:56:42,864 --> 00:56:45,283
Shh, shh, shh. Come on.

814
00:56:45,366 --> 00:56:48,119
All right?
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

815
00:56:51,706 --> 00:56:54,749
He had the cardiac arrest.

816
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:58,461
His head bent forward,
his knees buckled...

817
00:56:58,545 --> 00:57:00,963
and then he just fell...

818
00:57:02,591 --> 00:57:04,301
face forward into the pool.

819
00:57:04,383 --> 00:57:06,845
When she found him,
he was already dead.

820
00:57:06,928 --> 00:57:09,096
That's what we don't know.
That's what nobody knows.

821
00:57:09,263 --> 00:57:13,058
No, I know it. I would...
I saw the... I saw the... I saw the body.

822
00:57:13,142 --> 00:57:15,935
- I saw the... I prepared it.
I know exactly what...
- You don't know...

823
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:18,146
I would have seen...
I would have seen what...

824
00:57:18,229 --> 00:57:20,815
if there was any kind of struggle
that had gone on.

825
00:57:20,899 --> 00:57:23,693
- It was murder.
- No.

826
00:57:23,776 --> 00:57:25,819
What do you think?
What do you think?

827
00:57:25,903 --> 00:57:29,990
I, uh, I don't know.
I, um... You know, it's-it's possible.

828
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:33,577
Bob, we're talking about
thousands and thousands of dollars.

829
00:57:33,702 --> 00:57:36,537
- If she saw...
- She doesn't have to work...
- Even if she did wanna do it...

830
00:57:36,621 --> 00:57:39,415
- She doesn't have to work
for the rest of her life.
- Even if she did...

831
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,500
If-lf you saw somebody laying...

832
00:57:41,584 --> 00:57:44,629
with their head down
in the pool motionless...

833
00:57:44,712 --> 00:57:47,797
or even if they were kind of
limply doing that...

834
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,425
- which he wasn't doing,
but even if that...
- You don't know that!

835
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:54,304
Well, it-it was an extreme,
uh, "post-cardial" infarction.

836
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:57,431
- Extreme.
- So nothing's fishy?
- N-No.

837
00:57:57,514 --> 00:58:00,476
Hey, Gilbert, look!
It's that girl!

838
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,852
- Gilbert, it's that girl!
- It's perfectly logical.

839
00:58:02,936 --> 00:58:05,564
Even if it's...
Listen. Wait a minute, Tucker.

840
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,107
We're not talkin' about...
We're not talkin' about
takin' a gun and shootin' somebody.

841
00:58:08,233 --> 00:58:13,195
- We're talkin' about pushin' along
something that's rolling that direction.
- Hi!

842
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,782
- Please, play with me over there.
- Okay.
- Please?

843
00:58:15,865 --> 00:58:18,075
Come on. Let's play over there.
Come on. Please play...

844
00:58:18,158 --> 00:58:19,700
- Hi.
- How are you doin'?
- Fine.

845
00:58:19,784 --> 00:58:22,120
- Will you play over there?
Will you play?
- Okay. Okay, we'll play.

846
00:58:22,204 --> 00:58:24,872
- Settle down.
- We're gonna play!
- Okay, okay.

847
00:58:24,956 --> 00:58:27,833
- Will you give us a ride?
- Yeah, yeah.

848
00:58:32,964 --> 00:58:35,507
So, that's it.

849
00:58:35,632 --> 00:58:38,426
Yeah, I guess so.

850
00:58:40,761 --> 00:58:43,265
The magic part.

851
00:58:48,102 --> 00:58:51,312
The magic part?

852
00:58:51,396 --> 00:58:53,732
The magic part, Gilbert?

853
00:58:59,737 --> 00:59:02,114
- Hey, could we go...
- Grandma, here it is.
- Yeah?

854
00:59:02,281 --> 00:59:05,742
- Oh, thanks.
- Can we go play now?

855
00:59:05,826 --> 00:59:07,953
- What are we gonna play?
- Hi.
- Hi.

856
00:59:08,036 --> 00:59:10,664
Can we play hide-and-go-seek?
Hide-and-go-seek?

857
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:12,373
- You like that?
- Gilbert?
- Mm-hmm?

858
00:59:12,456 --> 00:59:14,542
- Would you give me some help?
- Yeah, go ahead.

859
00:59:21,882 --> 00:59:24,427
- Hang on one second.
- Okay.

860
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:28,470
Try it.

861
00:59:37,313 --> 00:59:39,815
- I don't know.
- Yeah, I don't know.

862
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:43,443
I don't...
It's a mystery.

863
00:59:43,526 --> 00:59:46,446
- Gilbert, listen, thanks anyway.
- No problem.

864
00:59:47,488 --> 00:59:50,366
Come play with me in the water.

865
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:53,869
You can't find me.
You can't find me anywhere.

866
00:59:53,952 --> 00:59:56,413
Say-Say "Where's Arnie?"
Say that.

867
00:59:56,496 --> 00:59:58,665
No, I want you to come in with me.

868
00:59:58,749 --> 01:00:00,542
No.

869
01:00:00,626 --> 01:00:02,793
Say "Where's Arnie?"

870
01:00:02,877 --> 01:00:04,420
Say "Where's Arnie?"
Say that.

871
01:00:04,503 --> 01:00:06,797
Where's Arnie?

872
01:00:06,881 --> 01:00:11,344
You can't find me.
Say it again. Hi!

873
01:00:11,427 --> 01:00:14,804
Say it again,
and you gotta look for me around.

874
01:00:14,888 --> 01:00:18,058
I wanted you
to swim with me, Arnie.

875
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:20,726
Don't even try it, 'cause he's...
he's had a scare with water...

876
01:00:20,809 --> 01:00:23,103
and he won't...
he won't come in.

877
01:00:23,187 --> 01:00:25,481
I'm not comin' in the water.

878
01:00:27,066 --> 01:00:30,902
- You wanna come in the water?
- No.

879
01:00:30,985 --> 01:00:32,988
Why not?

880
01:00:35,281 --> 01:00:37,450
Are you scared
to come in the water?

881
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:40,285
- No, no.
- Are you sure?

882
01:00:40,369 --> 01:00:43,872
- I'm sure.
- He's scared.

883
01:00:43,997 --> 01:00:46,749
Are you scared, Gilbert?

884
01:00:46,832 --> 01:00:50,253
All right, what do you want to see?
Do you want to see...

885
01:00:50,336 --> 01:00:53,465
Do you want to see me get wet
a little, like this?

886
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:55,675
- Yeah.
- A little splash?

887
01:00:59,262 --> 01:01:01,763
A little more.

888
01:01:03,014 --> 01:01:05,016
Do you wanna see this?

889
01:01:06,518 --> 01:01:09,354
You want this, right?
Huh? You happy?

890
01:01:16,485 --> 01:01:20,114
Tell me what you want
as fast as it comes to you.

891
01:01:21,948 --> 01:01:23,658
- Okay?
- Okay.

892
01:01:23,741 --> 01:01:25,702
Okay, what do you want?

893
01:01:27,078 --> 01:01:29,371
- Faster!
- Okay.

894
01:01:29,454 --> 01:01:31,456
I want a new thing.

895
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:36,420
House. I want a new house
for the family.

896
01:01:39,672 --> 01:01:42,008
I want a...
I want Mama...

897
01:01:42,133 --> 01:01:44,260
to take aerobics classes.

898
01:01:45,553 --> 01:01:48,055
I want Ellen to grow up.

899
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:51,517
I want a new brain for Arnie.

900
01:01:51,601 --> 01:01:54,185
I want...

901
01:01:54,352 --> 01:01:57,022
What do you want for you?

902
01:01:57,105 --> 01:02:00,149
Just for you.

903
01:02:00,232 --> 01:02:02,401
I want to be a good person.

904
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:09,032
I can't... I can't do this.
I can't...

905
01:02:09,115 --> 01:02:12,285
- Okay.
- Where's Arnie?

906
01:02:15,371 --> 01:02:17,373
Arnie?

907
01:02:22,044 --> 01:02:24,671
Excuse me, ma'am,
have you seen my brother?

908
01:02:24,755 --> 01:02:26,797
No.

909
01:02:41,728 --> 01:02:43,354
Shit.

910
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:59,411
- Hey!
- Come on.

911
01:02:59,537 --> 01:03:01,996
Hey! Over here!

912
01:03:03,705 --> 01:03:05,500
- Hang on, son.
- Come on, now.

913
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:08,544
- I did it again!
- Get this unbuckled.

914
01:03:08,669 --> 01:03:11,255
All right, here we go.
There you go.

915
01:03:11,338 --> 01:03:13,423
It's all right, Jerry. I got him.
I got him. It's all right, Jerry.

916
01:03:13,507 --> 01:03:15,926
We're takin' him in.

917
01:03:16,009 --> 01:03:17,969
It's not gonna happen again,
I promise this time.

918
01:03:18,052 --> 01:03:20,012
We've warned you,
we've warned your sister...

919
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:21,931
that the next time
was gonna be the last time.

920
01:03:22,014 --> 01:03:25,643
- Great. Great.
- Flash the lights!
Play the siren, okay?

921
01:03:25,726 --> 01:03:27,769
- I don't believe this.
- Play the siren for me!

922
01:03:27,894 --> 01:03:29,855
Way to go, Gilbert.

923
01:03:32,274 --> 01:03:34,733
- Jerry, listen. You're gonna... You're
gonna have to take it easy on him.
- We'll take care of him, Gilbert.

924
01:03:34,817 --> 01:03:38,445
- You gotta... Really,
you gotta keep an eye on him.
- All right. All right.

925
01:03:38,529 --> 01:03:40,739
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

926
01:03:40,823 --> 01:03:44,868
Do the siren. Do the siren, okay?
Do the siren, all right?

927
01:03:56,712 --> 01:03:58,630
I know, Sheriff.

928
01:04:01,383 --> 01:04:04,469
I know that, Sheriff.

929
01:04:04,553 --> 01:04:07,513
Okay. Asshole!

930
01:04:10,683 --> 01:04:12,559
They're probably just teaching him
a lesson. They're probably just
proving a point.

931
01:04:12,684 --> 01:04:14,645
Yeah. That's right.

932
01:04:17,856 --> 01:04:20,901
Get my coat.

933
01:04:21,026 --> 01:04:23,737
What?

934
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:26,447
Get my coat.

935
01:04:27,656 --> 01:04:29,992
Get it!

936
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:43,295
Let's go.

937
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:58,476
Well, at least he's in a safe place.
At least someone's watching him.

938
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,520
Ellen, shut up.

939
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:17,117
You guys wait here.
I'll be right back, okay?

940
01:05:17,201 --> 01:05:19,662
Mama. Mama,
let Gilbert handle this.

941
01:05:27,877 --> 01:05:31,338
- Jerry, come on, please.
- Please, have a seat outside.

942
01:05:31,421 --> 01:05:34,341
- Please, you gotta let him out.
- You need to wait your turn, okay?

943
01:05:36,426 --> 01:05:38,846
- I don't think you guys understand.
It's gonna be...
- Look.

944
01:05:38,929 --> 01:05:42,975
No one's going to do a thing
until you go and sit down outside...

945
01:05:43,058 --> 01:05:44,851
Jerry!

946
01:05:47,144 --> 01:05:49,397
Jerry!

947
01:05:53,609 --> 01:05:55,569
Jerry!

948
01:06:02,867 --> 01:06:07,329
Jerry, I've come for my son.

949
01:06:08,496 --> 01:06:11,875
<i>Sheriff?
Sheriff, are you there?</i>

950
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,170
Bonnie, you'll need
to fill out some papers.

951
01:06:14,253 --> 01:06:16,462
No! No!

952
01:06:16,546 --> 01:06:19,089
- Police procedure requires...
- I want my boy, Jerry.

953
01:06:19,173 --> 01:06:23,677
- But Bonnie, you have to calm...
- My son! Give me my son!

954
01:06:34,979 --> 01:06:37,190
Come on. You're goin' home.

955
01:06:39,649 --> 01:06:43,028
Sunshine, you're free!
Oh, baby.

956
01:06:44,237 --> 01:06:47,199
- Don't disappear like that any more.
- Okay.

957
01:06:47,282 --> 01:06:50,743
- Promise me.
- Mom!

958
01:06:50,826 --> 01:06:53,495
You're free, baby. You're free.
Let's go home.

959
01:06:59,959 --> 01:07:02,463
Hi!

960
01:07:02,546 --> 01:07:04,547
Look!

961
01:07:16,517 --> 01:07:19,061
That's why she needs a cane.

962
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,253
Look at her!

963
01:08:06,562 --> 01:08:10,941
Mama, they didn't
flash the lights for me either.

964
01:08:13,484 --> 01:08:15,736
Flash the lights.

965
01:08:21,492 --> 01:08:23,869
Hey!

966
01:08:23,952 --> 01:08:26,288
Look at me!

967
01:08:26,413 --> 01:08:30,249
I'm hiding!
Say-Say "Where's Arnie?"

968
01:08:30,332 --> 01:08:32,626
- Say like that.
- Arnie, get down.

969
01:08:36,964 --> 01:08:38,965
Gilbert, come find me.

970
01:08:40,425 --> 01:08:42,385
Where's Arnie?

971
01:08:44,679 --> 01:08:46,890
Hey.

972
01:08:46,973 --> 01:08:49,183
That's my mom in there.

973
01:08:49,266 --> 01:08:51,602
My mama.

974
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:54,605
Gilbert,
come play with me up here.

975
01:08:54,688 --> 01:08:56,939
Come play with me.

976
01:09:12,997 --> 01:09:15,749
God, that was so brave,
what your mother did.

977
01:09:17,124 --> 01:09:19,836
You know that, right?

978
01:09:21,337 --> 01:09:23,756
I'd like to meet her.

979
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,841
No, you wouldn't.

980
01:09:29,512 --> 01:09:31,513
Hey, where do you go next?

981
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:11,757
I would like to meet your mom.

982
01:10:19,722 --> 01:10:24,519
In sure and certain hope of
the resurrection to eternal life...

983
01:10:24,602 --> 01:10:27,856
we commend to Almighty God
our brother, Kenneth Carver...

984
01:10:28,939 --> 01:10:32,067
and we commit his body
to the ground.

985
01:10:32,151 --> 01:10:35,236
Earth to earth...

986
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:38,865
ashes to ashes
and dust to dust.

987
01:10:40,408 --> 01:10:42,618
The Lord bless him
and keep him.

988
01:10:42,785 --> 01:10:45,454
The Lord make his face
shine on him...

989
01:10:45,537 --> 01:10:47,581
and be gracious to him.

990
01:10:47,706 --> 01:10:50,625
The Lord look upon him
with favour...

991
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:53,795
and give him peace.

992
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:58,633
Lord Jesus, by your death
you took away the sting of death.

993
01:10:58,717 --> 01:11:01,719
Grant to us, your servants,
so to follow in faith...

994
01:11:01,802 --> 01:11:04,346
- for you have led the way...
- Hey! Hey!

995
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:07,098
- that we may at length
fall asleep peacefully in you...
- Lookit here!

996
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:08,976
- Lookit here!
- great in your likeness...

997
01:11:09,059 --> 01:11:14,856
- Look where I'm pointing!
- the God of peace who brought again
from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ.

998
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:18,192
The great shepherd of the sheep,
through the blood of
the everlasting covenant...

999
01:11:18,275 --> 01:11:22,571
- It's a Burger Barn, Gilbert!
- make you perfect in
every good work to do his will...

1000
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:26,782
- Gilbert, it's a Burger Barn!
- working in you that which is
well pleasing in his sight...

1001
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:30,328
- Burger Barn!
- through Jesus Christ, amen.

1002
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:39,878
- Hey.
- Boys, you can have anything you want.

1003
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:44,298
You could get candy if you want.
You can have candy if you want too.

1004
01:11:44,381 --> 01:11:47,010
As for me,
something with menthol, please.

1005
01:11:47,092 --> 01:11:49,720
You like gum?
Do you like gum?

1006
01:11:49,804 --> 01:11:52,306
I like gum.
Here's a good kind.

1007
01:11:52,389 --> 01:11:55,892
- Here, take this.
You can have it. Take it.
- Hey.

1008
01:11:58,436 --> 01:12:02,190
- You want gum too?
- We're going to St Louis.

1009
01:12:02,273 --> 01:12:04,483
I can't stay in that house.

1010
01:12:07,278 --> 01:12:09,655
I really am sorry about your...

1011
01:12:12,366 --> 01:12:15,201
Here, Mommy will take care of it.
You run on outside.

1012
01:12:19,789 --> 01:12:21,706
Everybody thinks I killed him.

1013
01:12:24,627 --> 01:12:27,546
Do you?

1014
01:12:27,587 --> 01:12:29,965
No.

1015
01:12:37,513 --> 01:12:40,141
I miss him...

1016
01:12:43,101 --> 01:12:44,895
and I don't.

1017
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:47,897
I miss him, and I don't.

1018
01:13:02,035 --> 01:13:06,497
So, Gilbert,
what's to become of you?

1019
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:11,002
Oh, I'll probably just...

1020
01:13:11,085 --> 01:13:14,254
You haven't thought about it.

1021
01:13:14,337 --> 01:13:18,258
Poor Gilbert... cooped up...

1022
01:13:18,341 --> 01:13:21,887
taking care of everybody else,
forgettin' all about you.

1023
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:24,513
- Mommy?
- Mommy is coming in a minute, honey.

1024
01:13:24,597 --> 01:13:26,599
Okay.

1025
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,521
Concerning my boys?

1026
01:13:32,646 --> 01:13:37,317
I was thinkin' that if my boys
turn out anything like you...

1027
01:13:40,736 --> 01:13:42,405
Hi.

1028
01:13:52,956 --> 01:13:55,458
I was thinkin'
how that would be nice...

1029
01:13:55,541 --> 01:13:57,877
for my boys to be like you.

1030
01:14:15,476 --> 01:14:17,144
He's all yours.

1031
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:30,323
Are you gonna miss her?

1032
01:14:32,825 --> 01:14:34,785
Yeah.

1033
01:14:38,788 --> 01:14:41,291
Good.

1034
01:15:41,887 --> 01:15:44,014
Damn it!

1035
01:16:09,078 --> 01:16:12,539
So, what do you think?

1036
01:16:14,875 --> 01:16:17,085
- Wow.
- Right?
- Wow.

1037
01:16:17,169 --> 01:16:20,130
Right?
Here, try a milkshake.

1038
01:16:24,801 --> 01:16:26,844
Real milk in there.

1039
01:16:26,969 --> 01:16:29,596
- You're kidding.
- Real milk.

1040
01:16:35,143 --> 01:16:38,896
Bob... Oh, Bob.

1041
01:16:39,021 --> 01:16:42,108
- Hey! Congratulations!
This looks great!
- Thanks, Bob.

1042
01:16:42,233 --> 01:16:44,485
- Yeah, thanks. Thanks a million.
- What?

1043
01:16:44,568 --> 01:16:47,113
What, are you tryin'
to depress everybody?
You're gonna ruin everyone's appetite.

1044
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:51,450
Hey, hey. l... Mike, right?
You wanna come to my party tomorrow?

1045
01:16:51,534 --> 01:16:54,077
I'm gonna be 18 years old.
Wanna come?

1046
01:16:54,202 --> 01:16:57,580
You can come too, if you want to.
I don't know you, but you can come.

1047
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:03,001
<i>How nice to see so many of you here
on this great day.</i>

1048
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:07,089
<i>This day marks the beginning
of a new era for Endora...</i>

1049
01:17:07,172 --> 01:17:11,801
<i>for the Burger Barn family and,
I hope, for all of you.</i>

1050
01:17:11,884 --> 01:17:14,762
<i>We at Burger Barn are committed...</i>

1051
01:17:14,846 --> 01:17:19,891
<i>- "to a very special relationship with"
you, one that will last and last.
- Hi.</i>

1052
01:17:19,975 --> 01:17:23,395
<i>In a time when so many things
are falling apart...</i>

1053
01:17:23,478 --> 01:17:26,730
<i>Endora decides to give
Burger Barn a chance...</i>

1054
01:17:27,899 --> 01:17:30,234
<i>a new breath of life.</i>

1055
01:17:30,317 --> 01:17:35,156
She fixed it.
The camper's fixed...

1056
01:17:35,239 --> 01:17:37,991
and we're gonna
be leaving tomorrow.

1057
01:18:01,763 --> 01:18:03,764
Come on!

1058
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:24,073
Hey, you can come to my party
tomorrow, okay? You can come.

1059
01:18:24,157 --> 01:18:26,160
Okay.

1060
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:35,334
- Hey!
- Hi, Arnie.
- So, I'm invited.

1061
01:18:38,629 --> 01:18:40,923
Okay.

1062
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:51,099
- Do you not want me to go?
- No.

1063
01:18:51,182 --> 01:18:54,143
I mean, go if you want.

1064
01:18:57,772 --> 01:19:01,066
Oh, so this is...
is this how you want it?

1065
01:19:06,946 --> 01:19:09,406
I have to go.

1066
01:19:11,991 --> 01:19:14,370
Take care, okay?

1067
01:19:22,835 --> 01:19:24,838
Goodbye, Arnie.

1068
01:19:27,172 --> 01:19:30,092
- Oh, no.
- Come on, let's get that bath.

1069
01:19:30,134 --> 01:19:33,010
No. No!

1070
01:19:33,136 --> 01:19:35,556
Hey, Arnie?

1071
01:19:35,639 --> 01:19:38,266
- Arnie?
- Guys!

1072
01:19:38,391 --> 01:19:40,184
Arnie.

1073
01:19:40,309 --> 01:19:43,061
You gotta take a bath, Arnie.

1074
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:46,356
Arnie.

1075
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:48,400
Arnie, you gotta do it.
It's your birthday.

1076
01:19:51,027 --> 01:19:53,404
- Arnie!
- Oh, no!
- Damn it!

1077
01:19:53,487 --> 01:19:57,116
Arnie, no!

1078
01:19:57,199 --> 01:20:00,285
Oh, God.

1079
01:20:00,368 --> 01:20:03,413
I can't make another one.
I can't.

1080
01:20:06,125 --> 01:20:08,376
We have to have a cake, Gilbert.

1081
01:20:24,849 --> 01:20:28,019
<i>Attention, Foodland shoppers.
Remember, every day this week...</i>

1082
01:20:28,144 --> 01:20:30,146
<i>is a double coupon day.</i>

1083
01:20:39,738 --> 01:20:42,323
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yes.

1084
01:20:42,406 --> 01:20:45,701
Um, my sister called in
an order for Grape.

1085
01:20:45,785 --> 01:20:47,953
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's all set.

1086
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:54,709
There you go.
That'll be 19.75.

1087
01:21:11,724 --> 01:21:13,976
- Go away, Arnie.
- Gilbert, what's in there?

1088
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:17,188
- It's a surprise. Leave it alone.
- What's-What's in that box?

1089
01:21:17,271 --> 01:21:19,189
Don't touch it.
If you touch it, I'm gonna kill you.

1090
01:21:19,272 --> 01:21:21,192
I can't believe you.

1091
01:21:21,275 --> 01:21:25,445
Look, I'll enjoy the party
from in here. It'll be fine.

1092
01:21:25,529 --> 01:21:27,739
Now, you'll see.
Everything'll be just fine.

1093
01:21:27,823 --> 01:21:29,824
What am I
supposed to say to people?

1094
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:35,162
I mean, it's Arnie's 18th birthday.
Haven't you been waiting
to do this for a long time?

1095
01:21:35,288 --> 01:21:38,416
I mean, wasn't it you that wanted to
have this huge party in the first place?

1096
01:21:38,541 --> 01:21:41,001
I didn't want to.

1097
01:21:42,336 --> 01:21:45,255
- Damn it!
- I can't believe you!

1098
01:21:45,338 --> 01:21:48,758
- Arnie!
- Oh, man.
- Look, he's eating the cake!

1099
01:21:48,842 --> 01:21:51,052
- Shit!
- Arnie!
- That's it. Forget it.

1100
01:21:51,136 --> 01:21:53,178
- Forget it.
- Nice job, Arnie.
- Arnie!

1101
01:21:53,262 --> 01:21:55,222
Now what are we gonna do?

1102
01:21:56,014 --> 01:21:59,184
Arnie! Arnie.

1103
01:21:59,268 --> 01:22:01,394
Come here. Come here! Come here!

1104
01:22:01,477 --> 01:22:05,857
Do you know what that fucking cost?
Do you know what I had to do?

1105
01:22:05,982 --> 01:22:08,526
Come on.
No, no, it's time for your bath.

1106
01:22:16,575 --> 01:22:19,077
Get your clothes off.
Get 'em off!

1107
01:22:25,958 --> 01:22:29,211
- Get in that bath.
- Gilbert, no!
- Get your fucking clothes off.

1108
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:31,296
Come on.

1109
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:36,176
- Gilbert, no!
- Don't move. Don't move!

1110
01:22:36,259 --> 01:22:38,051
Gilbert, stop!

1111
01:23:06,912 --> 01:23:08,871
Gilbert!

1112
01:23:08,996 --> 01:23:10,957
What did you do?

1113
01:23:29,014 --> 01:23:31,309
Mama!

1114
01:23:32,935 --> 01:23:34,937
Arnie?

1115
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:39,524
Arnie!

1116
01:23:44,112 --> 01:23:46,113
What is goin' on?

1117
01:23:47,573 --> 01:23:50,242
Don't worry, Mama.
Ellen, let's go.

1118
01:25:41,425 --> 01:25:44,512
- We should call his mother.
- No, no, no. It's okay. I know...

1119
01:25:44,595 --> 01:25:46,846
I know where he lives.
I can take him.

1120
01:25:46,971 --> 01:25:48,973
It's really okay. Yeah.

1121
01:25:57,564 --> 01:25:59,775
Arnie, you wanna go for a walk?

1122
01:26:02,693 --> 01:26:04,822
You wanna go play, Arnie?

1123
01:26:24,630 --> 01:26:26,632
Come on, Arnie.

1124
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:39,018
Come on, Arnie.
You can do it.

1125
01:26:41,146 --> 01:26:44,565
Come on, Arnie.
You can do it. Come on.

1126
01:26:44,648 --> 01:26:47,735
- "Merrily, merrily." Sing that.
- Okay.

1127
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:50,028
<i>Row, row, row your boat</i>

1128
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:53,157
<i>Gently down the stream</i>

1129
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:56,577
Yea! Yea!
You did it!

1130
01:26:57,785 --> 01:27:00,954
Good job, Arnie!
You did it!

1131
01:27:07,586 --> 01:27:10,338
So I'll see you
in a little bit, okay?

1132
01:27:10,422 --> 01:27:12,632
- Bye!
- Bye, Arnie.

1133
01:27:12,716 --> 01:27:14,341
Take care.

1134
01:27:14,467 --> 01:27:17,596
You know, I "drownded," huh?
I "drownded" over there.

1135
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:20,347
No, you just got clean.

1136
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:25,685
Arnie!

1137
01:27:25,769 --> 01:27:28,188
Hi! How are you?

1138
01:27:32,274 --> 01:27:34,194
- No, I'm fine.
- You sure?

1139
01:27:34,277 --> 01:27:36,570
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- All right.

1140
01:27:36,695 --> 01:27:39,865
- Bye!
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

1141
01:28:08,265 --> 01:28:11,394
I hit him.

1142
01:28:11,519 --> 01:28:13,645
I hit him so hard, l...

1143
01:28:16,856 --> 01:28:19,400
He's gonna be okay.

1144
01:28:21,611 --> 01:28:24,279
You don't hurt Arnie.
You just don't.

1145
01:28:34,205 --> 01:28:38,209
I gotta go. I gotta go.

1146
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:10,821
I got nowhere to go.

1147
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:20,289
I had to work extra hours
just to feed her.

1148
01:29:21,748 --> 01:29:24,625
So it's your fault?

1149
01:29:24,709 --> 01:29:28,628
You don't understand. She was
in shock for years. He disappeared.

1150
01:29:28,712 --> 01:29:31,631
He didn't say goodbye.
He just...

1151
01:29:33,175 --> 01:29:36,887
One day, all of a sudden...

1152
01:29:39,388 --> 01:29:42,516
he was gone.

1153
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,894
He was just hangin' there.

1154
01:29:46,854 --> 01:29:49,356
That's when it all started.

1155
01:29:51,108 --> 01:29:54,194
She used to be so pretty.

1156
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:59,031
She was so pretty
and so fun.

1157
01:30:01,326 --> 01:30:04,036
So you think it's his fault?

1158
01:30:06,622 --> 01:30:09,374
No.

1159
01:30:09,457 --> 01:30:13,503
Nobody knew what he felt.
He didn't give anything.

1160
01:30:13,586 --> 01:30:16,381
He was just sort of there.

1161
01:30:16,464 --> 01:30:19,883
You'd try to play with him,
you know, get him to play around...

1162
01:30:19,966 --> 01:30:23,095
or get him to laugh
or get him to smile or get him to...

1163
01:30:23,178 --> 01:30:25,389
I don't know... get mad.

1164
01:30:27,307 --> 01:30:30,059
But nothin'.

1165
01:30:32,187 --> 01:30:34,855
Just like, uh, he was already dead.

1166
01:30:39,151 --> 01:30:41,403
I used to know a guy like that.

1167
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:11,067
- Hey.
- Hi.

1168
01:32:15,862 --> 01:32:18,616
It's Arnie's birthday.

1169
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:20,658
I need to go home.

1170
01:32:46,306 --> 01:32:47,891
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1171
01:32:47,974 --> 01:32:49,976
Give my regards to your mother.

1172
01:32:51,687 --> 01:32:54,564
- Hey, Amy, look who's here.
- Where you been?

1173
01:32:54,648 --> 01:32:57,108
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- He's alive.

1174
01:33:17,292 --> 01:33:20,254
Amy?

1175
01:33:20,337 --> 01:33:22,339
Where's Arnie?

1176
01:33:26,385 --> 01:33:29,429
Amy. Please, Amy.

1177
01:33:33,808 --> 01:33:35,809
Is he okay?

1178
01:33:38,478 --> 01:33:40,564
I think you better
ask him that yourself.

1179
01:33:46,402 --> 01:33:48,863
Where is he?

1180
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:58,204
I wonder where he could be.

1181
01:34:07,087 --> 01:34:09,298
Amy?

1182
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:15,137
Have you seen Arnie?

1183
01:34:15,219 --> 01:34:17,764
Um, no, I thought he was with you.

1184
01:34:17,889 --> 01:34:20,099
- No.
- No?

1185
01:34:20,183 --> 01:34:21,684
No.

1186
01:34:29,232 --> 01:34:31,193
Arnie?

1187
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:36,906
Arnie? Anybody seen Arnie?

1188
01:34:39,075 --> 01:34:41,077
Where's my brother?

1189
01:34:45,915 --> 01:34:47,916
Boo!

1190
01:34:50,835 --> 01:34:52,671
Boo.

1191
01:35:01,178 --> 01:35:03,054
Come here.

1192
01:35:03,137 --> 01:35:04,972
You scared me, buddy.

1193
01:35:06,766 --> 01:35:10,560
You scared Gilbert.
Don't scare Gilbert, okay?

1194
01:35:11,646 --> 01:35:14,564
- Don't scare Gilbert, okay?
- Okay.

1195
01:35:29,954 --> 01:35:32,707
Come here.

1196
01:35:32,790 --> 01:35:35,041
Who's got you?

1197
01:35:50,764 --> 01:35:53,517
You better talk to Mama.

1198
01:35:57,645 --> 01:35:59,605
Mama?

1199
01:36:08,195 --> 01:36:10,198
Mama?

1200
01:36:15,244 --> 01:36:17,371
What you did was...

1201
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:23,668
He's a helpless boy, Gilbert.

1202
01:36:31,134 --> 01:36:33,761
And then disappearing like that?

1203
01:36:35,347 --> 01:36:38,265
I hate that.

1204
01:36:38,349 --> 01:36:40,433
You know how I hate that.

1205
01:36:44,145 --> 01:36:46,773
You walked out,
and I thought...

1206
01:36:46,856 --> 01:36:49,025
I can't take another.

1207
01:36:52,445 --> 01:36:55,947
But you came back, Gilbert.

1208
01:36:56,030 --> 01:36:58,450
Why?

1209
01:36:58,533 --> 01:37:00,284
Why did you?

1210
01:37:08,417 --> 01:37:10,418
I don't know, Mama.

1211
01:37:11,961 --> 01:37:16,466
I'm here now.
I'm here now.

1212
01:37:19,594 --> 01:37:21,929
Yes, you are.

1213
01:37:23,056 --> 01:37:25,099
You came back for the party.

1214
01:37:30,062 --> 01:37:33,690
Oh, Gilbert.

1215
01:37:33,773 --> 01:37:37,693
I can't imagine
how it's been for you kids.

1216
01:37:40,570 --> 01:37:43,281
I know what a burden I am.

1217
01:37:43,365 --> 01:37:45,367
Don't say that.

1218
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:49,121
I know it.

1219
01:37:49,204 --> 01:37:52,039
And I know that
you're ashamed of me.

1220
01:37:53,416 --> 01:37:56,043
No, I'm not.

1221
01:37:56,127 --> 01:37:58,670
No, I'm not.

1222
01:38:05,385 --> 01:38:09,930
I never, never meant
to be like this.

1223
01:38:11,724 --> 01:38:15,394
I never wanted to be a joke.

1224
01:38:15,477 --> 01:38:18,730
- You're no joke, Mama.
- I never wanted to be.

1225
01:38:18,813 --> 01:38:21,191
You're no joke.

1226
01:38:21,275 --> 01:38:24,152
- You're no joke.
- Oh, Gilbert.

1227
01:38:24,235 --> 01:38:28,239
Please don't disappear.
Please don't disappear.

1228
01:38:34,619 --> 01:38:39,624
- Hurry! Hurry!
- You're really growing up to be
quite a young lady.

1229
01:38:39,749 --> 01:38:43,127
- Thanks.
- Hey. Hi.
- Hey.

1230
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:45,212
You know, I don't want to
rain on the day here...

1231
01:38:45,296 --> 01:38:47,298
but you have a serious
foundation problem.

1232
01:38:47,381 --> 01:38:50,925
You see how this...
the porch is slanted right here?

1233
01:38:51,009 --> 01:38:54,638
I mean, this is
a serious problem, Gilbert.
We need to get up underneath here...

1234
01:38:54,721 --> 01:38:57,807
First of all, we need to fill this in
so that no more water collects here.

1235
01:38:57,891 --> 01:38:59,933
And then we'll probably...
What?

1236
01:39:06,814 --> 01:39:08,359
- Hi.
- Hi.

1237
01:39:08,442 --> 01:39:10,943
- Hello, Gilbert.
- Nana.

1238
01:39:13,237 --> 01:39:15,907
- You ready?
- For what?

1239
01:39:16,948 --> 01:39:19,868
I want you to...
I want you to come meet somebody.

1240
01:39:21,453 --> 01:39:23,329
Okay.

1241
01:39:23,412 --> 01:39:25,832
- Hey!
- Hi, Arnie.
- Hi.

1242
01:39:25,916 --> 01:39:29,211
- Here's your present.
- Arnie, what do you say?

1243
01:39:29,294 --> 01:39:31,295
Thank you!

1244
01:39:38,134 --> 01:39:39,679
Mama?

1245
01:39:42,347 --> 01:39:45,392
Mama, I want you
to meet somebody.

1246
01:39:46,935 --> 01:39:49,728
- No!
- Please?

1247
01:39:52,147 --> 01:39:54,565
- Just this once, for me?
- Gilbert, it's okay.

1248
01:39:54,649 --> 01:39:57,777
- We can do it later.
- No. This is what I want.

1249
01:39:59,153 --> 01:40:01,489
Do it for me, please?

1250
01:40:01,572 --> 01:40:04,574
This is different.
Nobody's gonna laugh.

1251
01:40:04,658 --> 01:40:07,412
I'm not gonna hurt you
any more, Mama.

1252
01:40:07,495 --> 01:40:10,038
I promise.

1253
01:40:11,038 --> 01:40:13,041
Please.

1254
01:40:16,461 --> 01:40:18,504
Okay.

1255
01:40:18,587 --> 01:40:22,049
Okay. Becky?

1256
01:40:30,807 --> 01:40:33,810
Mama, this is Becky.

1257
01:40:33,893 --> 01:40:36,270
- Hello.
- Hi.

1258
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:45,862
I haven't always been like this.

1259
01:40:48,032 --> 01:40:50,867
I haven't always been like this.

1260
01:40:58,040 --> 01:41:00,459
- I'm called a miracle.
- You're a miracle?

1261
01:41:00,542 --> 01:41:02,918
- I'm a miracle.
- A walking miracle. I can believe that.

1262
01:41:03,044 --> 01:41:05,464
I'm just gonna put this up here.

1263
01:41:05,547 --> 01:41:08,966
- Uh, bye.
- Goodbye, Arnie.

1264
01:41:09,051 --> 01:41:10,843
- Bye.
- You take care.

1265
01:41:19,934 --> 01:41:22,187
I had a really nice time.

1266
01:41:24,647 --> 01:41:26,191
I know.

1267
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:39,410
- I don't know what to say.
- Say, "Thank you," Gilbert.

1268
01:41:39,494 --> 01:41:41,663
Say, "Thank you."

1269
01:41:51,045 --> 01:41:53,006
Thank you.

1270
01:42:00,971 --> 01:42:04,891
- Goodbye.
- No, it's not goodbye, Arnie.

1271
01:42:04,975 --> 01:42:09,896
It's goodnight. Goodnight...
Goodnight to you, but not me.

1272
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:12,147
Hey, they're coming!

1273
01:42:12,232 --> 01:42:15,276
Bye! Wait!

1274
01:42:35,919 --> 01:42:38,714
Mama?

1275
01:42:42,508 --> 01:42:44,386
Mama, what are you doing?

1276
01:42:51,517 --> 01:42:53,727
<i>To work in Danny's office.</i>

1277
01:42:56,062 --> 01:42:58,023
<i>I thought you'd be pleased.</i>

1278
01:42:58,148 --> 01:43:00,108
<i>Oh, I am pleased.</i>

1279
01:43:02,526 --> 01:43:04,946
<i>So close your eyes.</i>

1280
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:34,639
Amy? Amy?

1281
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:41,561
You rest, Mama.

1282
01:43:43,271 --> 01:43:45,273
You deserve to rest.

1283
01:43:47,484 --> 01:43:50,653
Amy, get me my birthday boy.

1284
01:43:50,736 --> 01:43:52,739
- I want my birthday boy.
- Okay.

1285
01:43:52,822 --> 01:43:56,367
Here, Mama.
Here's the water.

1286
01:43:56,450 --> 01:43:58,452
Gilbert.

1287
01:44:02,455 --> 01:44:04,874
You're my knight
in shimmering armour.

1288
01:44:04,958 --> 01:44:07,001
Did you know that?

1289
01:44:08,086 --> 01:44:10,129
I think you mean shining.

1290
01:44:11,088 --> 01:44:14,508
No. Shimmering.

1291
01:44:14,675 --> 01:44:16,969
You shimmer and you glow.

1292
01:44:24,183 --> 01:44:28,937
You rest, okay?
Get some sleep.

1293
01:44:44,952 --> 01:44:46,954
Hey!

1294
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:51,041
Mama!

1295
01:44:52,917 --> 01:44:55,670
Mama! Mama!

1296
01:44:55,753 --> 01:44:58,089
Wake up!

1297
01:45:00,090 --> 01:45:02,092
You're hiding, huh?

1298
01:45:04,386 --> 01:45:06,346
I know that.

1299
01:45:09,098 --> 01:45:11,100
Wake up!

1300
01:45:13,311 --> 01:45:17,398
Mama, wake up!

1301
01:45:49,594 --> 01:45:53,096
Mama, stop it now!

1302
01:45:53,179 --> 01:45:55,307
Stop, Mama!

1303
01:45:58,727 --> 01:46:00,311
Stop it.

1304
01:46:06,776 --> 01:46:09,612
Arnie? Arnie?

1305
01:46:12,238 --> 01:46:14,240
What's wrong?

1306
01:46:14,324 --> 01:46:16,326
What's wrong? Stop it!

1307
01:46:17,451 --> 01:46:19,913
Gilbert!

1308
01:46:19,996 --> 01:46:21,997
Gilbert!

1309
01:46:23,415 --> 01:46:25,668
- Arnie!
- Don't... Give me... Stop!

1310
01:47:05,619 --> 01:47:07,581
Mom!

1311
01:47:20,758 --> 01:47:22,927
I'm gonna need
some more men, Amy.

1312
01:47:24,345 --> 01:47:28,057
Hey, flash the lights.
Flash 'em.

1313
01:47:28,182 --> 01:47:31,685
<i>You may need the National Guard
to move her out of there.</i>

1314
01:47:31,768 --> 01:47:33,770
I'm sorry about that.

1315
01:47:44,906 --> 01:47:47,407
l-It's gonna take a crane
to get her out.

1316
01:47:51,870 --> 01:47:54,079
There's gonna be a crowd.

1317
01:47:55,874 --> 01:47:58,334
I just know
there's gonna be a crowd.

1318
01:49:07,604 --> 01:49:09,815
She's so beautiful.

1319
01:49:09,940 --> 01:49:12,608
She's no joke. She's no joke.

1320
01:49:22,534 --> 01:49:24,912
I'm not gonna let her be a joke.

1321
01:49:46,139 --> 01:49:47,807
Arnie.

1322
01:49:49,933 --> 01:49:52,270
We're gonna need your help.

1323
01:53:04,943 --> 01:53:07,445
Gilbert, is that them?

1324
01:53:07,529 --> 01:53:09,988
No. No, not yet.

1325
01:53:10,072 --> 01:53:13,492
- When are they gonna come?
- Pretty soon.

1326
01:53:13,575 --> 01:53:15,786
Pretty soon.

1327
01:53:15,869 --> 01:53:18,538
My brother Arnie's
about to turn 19.

1328
01:53:19,664 --> 01:53:22,833
Nineteen.

1329
01:53:22,917 --> 01:53:25,544
Gilbert, look there!

1330
01:53:25,627 --> 01:53:28,172
Amy got a job offer
to manage a bakery in Des Moines.

1331
01:53:28,255 --> 01:53:29,923
- Is that them?
- Yeah, that's them.

1332
01:53:30,006 --> 01:53:32,759
Ellen can't wait
to switch schools.

1333
01:53:32,842 --> 01:53:34,678
Arnie asked if we were gonna
go, too, and I said...

1334
01:53:34,761 --> 01:53:39,390
"Well, we can go anywhere
if we want.

1335
01:53:39,473 --> 01:53:42,476
- Becky!
- We can go anywhere."

1336
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,562
Becky's comin', huh, Gilbert?

1337
01:53:44,645 --> 01:53:46,938
Yep. She's comin'.

1338
01:53:47,022 --> 01:53:49,357
Becky!

1339
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,734
Come on! Come on, Gilbert.

1340
01:54:08,750 --> 01:54:10,459
Hey!

1341
01:54:15,047 --> 01:54:17,048
Hi! Hi.

1342
01:54:17,132 --> 01:54:19,801
Hi! Hi!

1343
01:54:21,219 --> 01:54:24,139
- I'm fine.
- Hi!
- How are you?
