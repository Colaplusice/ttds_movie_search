They wanna toss my cell, Jimmy.
They're gonna find my manuscript.

74
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:49,300
That book is the only thing
I got left in here.

75
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,890
You understand me? That's the only
chance I got to get out of here.

76
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,100
I lose that, they gonna lose too.

77
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,590
Rubin, who do you think the first man
through this door has gotta be now?

78
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,150
It's me.

79
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,230
- Listen-
- All right. Tell 'em to come on in here.

80

- And line 'em up. - What
if- - Line 'em up, Jimmy.

81
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,480
Rubin, listen to me now.
What if that manuscript...

82
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,570
wasn't in this cell
when we tossed it?

83
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,770
What if it was stuffed
down your pants or something...

84
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,200
stuffed in your crotch,
and we couldn't see it?

85
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,160
I can make sure
you weren't strip-searched, okay?

86
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,360
Don't bullshit me.

87
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,780
No bullshit.
You have my word.

88

Ain't nobody putting
their hands on me, Jimmy.

89
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,580
Ain't nobody gonna touch me.

90
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,710
All right.

91
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,170
Nobody touches you.

92
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,260
You think I killed them people?

93
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,020
I don't know, Rubin.

94
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,900

- It's on the steering post.

101
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,270
What's goin' on?

102
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,120
Aw, shit, Hurricane.
Didn't realize it was you.

103
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,290
Yeah, it's me.
What's goin' on, Theo?

104
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,250
We're lookin' for two negroes
in a white car.

105

- Any two will do?
- No-

106

Come on.

- Check his vitals.
- It's clear.

111
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,830
- Air passage.
- Heart rate has changed.

112
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,420
Keep the chin up.
Keep the passage open.

113
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,800
Can he talk, Doc?

114
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,100
- Just for a moment.
- Would you raise his head?

115
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,650
Can you make out these two men?
Are these the two men who shot you?

116
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:51,190
Look carefully, sir.
Are these the two men who did it?

117
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,740
- He said no.
- Move closer.

118

Take another look, sir.

120
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,560
Son of a bitch.

121
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,560
Sir, look closer.

122
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,860
You sure these aren't the men?

123
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,360
- Dirty son of a bitch.

00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,350
Is all these people out here
freezing their butts off to buy books?

157
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,930
- That's right.
- Lined up like this...

158
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,130
not for a movie
or a ball game or somethin'?

159
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:04,550
- Ain't it great?
- No, "isn't it." "Isn't it great?"

160
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,760
Very good.
I stand corrected, Les.

161
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,680
Used books,
books nobody wants any more.

162
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,690
Aw, that's the great thing
about books, you know.

163
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,570
Once you use 'em, you can pass 'em
along to somebody else like a torch...

164
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,230
or a football,
you know, something you pass.

165
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,530
Okay, bring it on in.

166
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,860
Put it down.
Good, good. Down.

167
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:17,840
Okay, young man,
that'll be 25 cents.

168
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,670
- Jesus.
- Twenty-five cent?

169
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,550
Mustn't be much of a book.

170
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,630
<i>- Ah, listen, everybody
- Everybody</i>

171
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,340
<i>Especially you, girl</i>

172
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,690
So, Lesra, what'd you get?

173
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,060
Uh, this.

174
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,060
- What is it?
- I don't know. It's about a boxer.

175
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,780
It's got like 337 pages,
though, you know.

176
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,770
Well, it probably takes a lot of words
to tell someone's life story, eh?

177
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,820
- Don't you think?
- Yeah, well, this guy must be...

178
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,370
like 150 years old, you know,
if he gon' use all these words.

179
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,540
You know what, Les? Sometimes
we don't pick the books we read.

180
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,170
<i>- They pick us.
- Somebody, somewhere</i>

181
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,590
<i>- I tell you, it's unfair
- Can I get some whisky</i>

182
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,720
<i>Can I get some whisky
Yeah</i>

183
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,720
Mr Broden, we've been home schooling
this young man for eight months.

184
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,930
That's how it applies to us.

185
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,890
No, I'm not married.
Mr Swinton, who you spoke with...

186
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,260
is one of the two men I live with.

187
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,930
No, Sam Chaiton is
the other man I live with.

188
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,060
No, I don't think you do see,
Mr Broden.

189
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,070
They are my business partners
and my roommates.

190
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,820
And you're the Department
of Education...

191
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,070
and you're telling me you're prepared
to stop this young man's education...

192
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,790
because you can't find
some goddam high school records?

193
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,590
Yep, that's exactly
what I'm doing, Mr Broden.

194
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,640
No, no, I'm not asking you
to make an exception.

195
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,010
I'm asking you to do your job,
which is qualitatively different...

196
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,680
but I thank you for it anyway.

197
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,810
- Shit.
- Political Science 101, the art of gentle persuasion.

198
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,030
Never mind 101.
I need a smoke.

199
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,070
- So how was the book sale?
- Great.

200
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,990
<i>- There.
- Did you get The Other America?</i>

201
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,580
<i>Uh, I couldn't find The Other America,
but I got you, uh-</i>

202
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,740
Sam Robertson Davies, R.D. Laing.

203
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,280
- You don't want to piss me off today.
- It's a book sale, Lisa, not a library.

204
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,960
- Whatever.
- Hey, look, Lisa.

205
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,540
<i>Got this one right here for 25 cent.
The Sixteenth Round.</i>

206
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,450
- Oh, your first book, huh?
- Yeah.

207
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,830
"Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter."

208
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,520
Hurricane is the professional name
that I acquired later on in life.

209
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,760
Carter is the slave name
that was given to my forefathers...

210
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,430
who worked in the cotton fields
of Alabama and, and Georgia...

211
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,030
and was passed on to me.

212
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,570
The kindest thing I can say
about my childhood...

213
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,990
is that I survived it.

214
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,860
Paterson was a run-down town,
a poor and violent place.

215
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,610
The only way to survive
was to know how to handle yourself...

216
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,500
and I learned fast.

217
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,870
Come on! Hurry up!

218
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,870
- Let's get out of here!
- Come on! Let's go! Hurry up! Let's get out of here!

219
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,890
Take this out.

220
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,930
Hey, Donnique, go for a swim!

221
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,100
Hello, boys.

222
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,360
Wanna see something?

223
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,750
Huh? Isn't that pretty?

224
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,670
You like that?

225
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,040
- What's your name?
- Donnique.

226
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,710
Donnique?

227
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,510
That's a pretty name, Donnique.

228
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,710
You wanna be good to me, sugar?

229
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:54,090
H- H-Hey, mister!
Leave him alone!

230
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,930
I wouldn't hurt your friend.
Would I?

231
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:02,780
You don't need
to be afraid, Donnique.

232
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,600
You're pretty.
How old are you?

233
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,140
- Ten.
- Ten?

234
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,810
I said, leave him alone!

235
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,540
Run! Run! Come on!

236
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,960
- Get outta here!
- Run!

237
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,450
You little bastard.

238
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,330
Let's get outta here!

239
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,130
You black bastard, you!
Goddam it!

240
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,500
Please, mister! Put me down!

241
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,130
- Shut up, you son of a bitch!
- Put me down!

242
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,510
Hey!

243
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,150
- I didn't- didn't do nothin'!
- Come on! Let's go!

244
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,250
- I didn't- I didn't-
- Shut up.

245
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,330
I didn't do nothin'.

246
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,120
- Come on, you-
- No!

247
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,840
- Get in there.
- I-It wasn't me.

248
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,230
I-I- didn't do nothin'!

249
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,640
Sit down, kid.

250
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,710
What have we got here?

251
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,880
It's a juvenile case.

252
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,700
He's a kid, Sarge.
He's only 11 years old.

253
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,080
It's a nigger with a knife.

254
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,390
I don't care how old he is.

255
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,760
Take care of him.

256
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,560
We know you were at the falls last week,
and we know what happened.

257
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,310
So you're gonna talk,
you little son of a bitch.

258
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,350
You'll be makin' speeches
when I get through with your black ass.

259
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,730
Ralph. Ralph.

260
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:33,370
I'm Sergeant Detective Della Pesca.

261
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,800
You wanna tell me what happened?

262
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,060
What is it, you were trying to rob
this man's gold watch...

263
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,730
and he fought back,
and so you stabbed him?

264
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,810
Is that pretty much it?

265
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,810
I-I- didn't do nothin'.

266
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,440
Let me tell you something, sunshine.

267
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,740
The man you stabbed...

268
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,960
is a very important member
of this community...

269
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,200
and you are goin' down.

270
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,840
Do you see?
And I am going to see to it personally.

271
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,810
As for you, Rubin Carter,
you're a menace to society.

272
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,510
If something isn't done
about you soon...

273
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,470
you'll become a dangerous man
in later life.

274
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,900
I only wish you were old enough
I could send you to state prison.

275
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,180
I therefore sentence you...

276
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,820
to the state home for boys
in Jamesburg...

277
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:40,450
from this day till you're
21 years of age.

278
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,950
- So be it.
- It's okay, son.

279
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,950
Jamesburg was a place of horror
that I would be forever sorry...

280
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,410
to have known existed.

281
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:54,410
It was there that I spent the next
eight years learning how to maim...

282
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:58,380
butcher and fight for my survival.

283
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,900
I don't get what's goin' on here.
I'm the boy's father.

284
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,560
I take care of him.
I don't know what you people-

285
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,860
I mean, what's it to you?

286
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,860
M- Mr Martin, we've gotten to know
Lesra over the past few weeks.

287
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,610
And I gotta tell you, he's got
more natural ability and enthusiasm...

288
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,450
than just about any kid
I've ever worked with.

289
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,490
So, when he told us
he wanted to go to college...

290
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,950
we just figured
that's the way it was gonna be.

291
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:39,210
Well, I know he's smart.

292
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,640
There's no doubt about that,
but, uh...

293
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,040
he can't read, Mrs Martin.

294
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,670
But we think that we could teach him.
I mean, within...

295
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,930
probably two years, with a lot of work,
we could get him ready for college.

296
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,680
- Yeah, well, that school sure not doin' it.
- Now wait just a second.

297
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,640
- I am that boy's father-
- But if they can give him more-

298
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,900
They're talkin' to me, Alma!

299
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,600
Uh, Mr Martin, you know,
we got plenty of room.

300
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,860
And if Lesra wants to learn,
then we can teach him.

301
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,820
If you don't want that, that's fine.
That's up to you.

302
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,570
But no one here is trying
to replace you, sir.

303
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,000
- This what you want, boy?
- I wanna go to college.

304
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,380
And if that's what it's gonna take,
then, yeah.

305
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,890
It don't seem right.

306
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,990
Why you gotta go, Lesra?

307
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,450
- Don't you want me to go, EI?
- You should be here backin' me up.

308
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,660
Leave the boy, Elston.
Lesra goin' to Toronto now.

309
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,460
Got a job to do.
Wants to go to college.

310
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,800
After eight years at Jamesburg,
I escaped.

311
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:09,100
I was angry,
embittered with life.

312
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,800
I ran as if on a cloud...

313
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:15,770
unaware of how high I was stepping
or of anything else around me.

314
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,430
There was room in my head
for only one word...

315
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:22,600
one thought:

316
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,200
Freedom.

317
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,730
I ran straight into the U.S. Army
and a pair of paratrooper wings...

318
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,690
and my whole life changed.

319
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,150
I learned that
knowledge of self and kind...

320
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,370
is the only true means
to the liberation of the black man.

321
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,370
I could do anything.
I overcame my stutter.

322
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,290
I became a prizefighter.
I came back to Paterson...

323
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,460
the all-Army European
welterweight champ.

324
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,720
Let me have a soda, please.

325
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,420
Judy, who's that fine soldier
standing over there at the bar?

326
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,060
Oh, he's a local boy.
Rubin Carter, I think.

327
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,660
Make it two.

328
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,750
- He's comin' over here.
- Uh-oh. Stay cool.

329
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,430
I'm back. I'm back.

330
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:33,710
- Mmm, so you missed me, did you?
- So tell me-

331
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:36,550
- Well, what do you want to know?
- You're in my seat.

332
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:41,520
Uh, you know, I'm from Georgia.

333
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,650
And I was thinkin'
that afterwards you and me-

334
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,940
You're in my seat, country.

335
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:54,520
I don't see your name anywhere.

336
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,330
That's 'cause you're blinded by
the ass-kickin' I'm about to put on you.

337
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,960
Now get up out of my seat.

338
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,320
- Hey, come on now. Take it easy.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

339
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,800
- Calm down. Calm down. - Let that
motherfucker go. - Just stop it. Listen.

340
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,220
- Not here.
- You know what? I wanna dance. You wanna come over here and dance with me?

341
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,210
- Not here. - Hey, I'm
talkin' to you. - Hmm?

342
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,750
Oh, you wanna fight,
or you wanna dance?

343
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,460
- He ain't worth it.
- Yeah, you wanna dance. Come on.

344
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,810
<i>- Brother got a lot of hostility up in him.
- Should I let myself go</i>

345
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,430
<i>In his direction</i>

346
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:31,980
<i>- Come on, sweet thing. Let's dance.
- Is his love strong enough</i>

347
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,370
<i>For my heart's protection</i>

348
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:44,330
<i>- I don't know
- I don't know, I don't know</i>

349
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,670
<i>- I don't know
- I don't know, I don't know</i>

350
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,720
<i>- You dance nice.
- But he loves me so good</i>

351
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,970
<i>- Till I think I should
- Thank you.</i>

352
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,920
<i>If I gave him my heart</i>

353
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:05,300
<i>- These hands were meant for more than just fighting.
- Would he refuse it</i>

354
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,810
<i>Would he tear it apart</i>

355
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:17,560
<i>- Or tenderly use it
- Her name was Mae Thelma.</i>

356
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,440
<i>- I don't know
- And she was the prettiest woman I had ever seen.</i>

357
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,460
<i>- I don't know
- I don't know, I don't know</i>

358
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,830
<i>But he hugs me so tight</i>

359
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,120
<i>Till I think I might</i>

360
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,760
You got a girl around?

361
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:39,390
No. I ain't got no girl.

362
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,510
No?

363
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,730
Well, I had a good time
with you tonight.

364
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:53,070
- Mae Thelma, is that you?
- Yeah. Mama, I'll be right up.

365
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,900
- You gon' call me tomorrow?
- I'm gon' call you tonight.

366
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,490
- No, you can't call me tonight now.
- I'll call you tomorrow then.

367
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,780
You'll call me tomorr-

368
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,380
- Is that your father?
- No. My father's asleep.

369
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,830
- Your name Rubin Carter?
- Yeah.

370
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,210
- You're comin' with us.
- For what?

371
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,420
You heard the man.

372
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,310
What'd you think,
we weren't gonna find you?

373
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,780
You still owe me time.

374
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,910
<i>104, meet Vice officers
at Glory Park.</i>

375
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,150
All right. Get out.

376
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,270
- This way now.
- Okay.

377
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,790
From that moment on...

378
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,200
I decided to take control
of my life.

379
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,380
I made up my mind
to turn my body into a weapon.

380
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:58,020
I would be a warrior-scholar.

381
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,530
I boxed. I went to school.

382
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,980
I began reading
W.E. B DuBois, Richard Wright.

383
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,870
Move, tier one! Move it!

384
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,670
So I gave up
all the worthless luxuries...

385
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,930
that most inmates crave-

386
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:29,210
the girlie books, fags,
cigarettes, the movies.

387
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,170
I hated them.

388
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,470
In fact, I hated everyone.
I didn't even speak English.

389
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,440
I spoke hate,
and its verbs were fists.

390
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,320
I made up my mind
to turn my body...

391
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:50,290
into a weapon that would
eventually set me free...

392
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,910
or kill anyone who sought
to keep me in prison.

393
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,220
On September 21, 1961...

394
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,690
I was released,
and I vowed upon everything holy...

395
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,350
never to come back to prison again.

396
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,030
I had spent almost half my time
on this Earth...

397
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,400
in jail.

398
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:54,100
Hey, come on, Lesra.
Time to get up. Breakfast, buddy.

399
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:59,350
Yeah. Yeah, all right.
Yeah, I'm up. I'm up.

400
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,810
Did you get any sleep?
Your light's been on all night.

401
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,700
I just can't stop reading, man.
This book's about my life.

402
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,520
Jeez, Lisa, you gotta smoke
for breakfast?

403
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:28,500
- Do you know when we met in Brooklyn?
- Yeah.

404
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,930
Why'd you take me home?

405
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,630
Well, you know, you-
you met my folks, man...

406
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:43,320
and you brought me up here,
you did all this stuff for me.

407
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,400
Yeah.

408
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,990
No, I mean, why?

409
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,100
Why'd you do all that?

410
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,910
'Cause you were smart and funny.

411
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:58,030
And short. You know, we figured
it'd be good for you to...

412
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,150
spend a little time
with some tall white people.

413
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:04,200
- Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah. - What,
did you do it 'cause I'm black?

414
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,870
And you thought
I couldn't do it myself?

415
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:12,580
'Cause Rubin- Rubin did it
all himself, you know.

416
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,140
Hey, Les, we didn't feel
sorry for you.

417
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,730
We met you and got to know you and realized you could accomplish some things...

418
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:22,220
and, like a lot of us,
you could use some help.

419
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:28,530
I'm sure that Hurricane Carter
had some help along the way.

420
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,940
- None of us does it alone.
- Hey.

421
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,480
As far as doin' it for yourself goes,
nobody can learn anything for you.

422
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:41,080
Trust me. Everything you're doing now,
you're doing for yourself.

423
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,910
I'll get it.

424
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,640
- You know, I been thinkin'.
- Yeah?

425
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,880
- How're you doing?
- About what?

426
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,480
No, no, no, he's here. He just-

427
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,390
Think I wanna put up a heavy bag.
You know, like a big punching bag.

428
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,680
Uh, those renovations?
Probably the end of the month.

429
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,390
- Oh, any special reason?
- No. No, man.

430
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,570
I just feel like punchin'
something, you know?

431
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,350
That's it. It's set.

432
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,440
- A little low. A little low.
- Keep your hand up. Keep the left down.

433
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:23,250
Straight out of prison,
I was a fighting machine.

434
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:28,250
One thing I could do,
and the only thing, was box.

435
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,300
I had tasted my own blood...

436
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,880
and I loved it.

437
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,710
This is your ringside commentator.

438
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,670
Tonight's fight brings together...

439
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:47,230
Rubin "Hurricane" Carter
from Paterson, New Jersey...

440
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:50,640
and Joey Cooper,
who is currently undefeated.

441
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,740
Yeah! Way to go, Hurricane!

442
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,530
Hit him!

443
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,250
And the champion, Joey Cooper,
seems to be helpless...

444
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,070
against Rubin Carter,
the challenger.

445
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,500
Yeah!

446
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,810
And I'll tell ya, folks,
things are taking a surprising turn...

447
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,180
in this middleweight fight tonight.

448
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,650
Joey Cooper in big trouble.
Rubin Carter pourin' it on.

449
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:34,060
Left hook, right hook, uppercut- Oh!

450
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,040
He's down.
Oh, look at this.

451
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,330
What a disaster for Cooper.

452
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,540
Carter is punishing him.
He's gonna- Oh, he is down, folks.

453
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,680
He is down for the count,
and he is not getting up.

454
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,760
- Four, five, six...
- I'll tell you that right now.

455
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,180
- Get up! - seven...
- Get up now!

456
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,390
Right now!

457
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,980
You're out!

458
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:17,150
Unbelievable! Rubin Carter
comes on like a hurricane...

459
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,230
and defeats
the undefeated Joey Cooper...

460
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,030
in round one of
this middleweight fight.

461
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,650
- I don't believe it! Oh!
- Unbelievable upset tonight.

462
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:28,460
Have you ever seen anything like it?

463
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:32,170
- And the crowd is goin' wild here in Reading, Pennsylvania.
- You all right, Cooper?

464
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:37,450
- And Rubin Carter took this fight right away from him here this evening.
- I'm okay.

465
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:47,100
Mrs Carter, what do you think it's gonna be like being married to such a ferocious fighter?

466
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:52,130
- Well, uh- - Well, it's gonna be a little
scary, but I'll try my best. All right.

467
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:56,350
Can you believe
that black son of a bitch?

468
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,060
He thinks he's champion of the world.
Fighter of the year, my ass.

469
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,070
A low-life criminal.

470
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,320
<i>My mother told me</i>

471
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,450
<i>'Fore she passed away</i>

472
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,410
<i>Said, son, when I'm gone</i>

473
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,430
<i>Don't forget to pray
'cause there'll be hard times</i>

474
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:30,210
<i>- What the hell do they expect? Of course a riot broke out.
- Hard times</i>

475
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,420
Every time we try to stand up
and defend our own neighbourhoods...

476
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,090
they send the cops in
to bust us in our heads.

477
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,860
If you feel so strongly about all this,
Hurricane, why aren't you out there...

478
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,770
instead of sittin' in here drinkin'?

479
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:48,150
I'm drinkin' club soda, first of all, and I'm in here because you asked me to be here.

480
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,370
But you're right.
Maybe I should go down there.

481
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,990
Yeah, maybe I should go grab my gun,
shoot me a half a dozen...

482
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,700
of them nigger-hatin' cops, huh?

483
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:01,130
What you think, Bucky? I know I can get
me about five of'em before they get me.

484
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,380
Ed? Huh?

485
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,920
How about you?
You wanna come?

486
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:20,690
Shit. That's off the record,
by the way.

487
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,390
Oh, he knows that.
Don't you?

488
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,990
Sure, champ. Sure.

489
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,980
You betcha.

490
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,700
- Take that, champ!
- Get down.

491
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,330
- Right here.
- Rubin, what is this?

492
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:52,510
- Get down, get down! Stay down! - Oh,
Lord, what is- - Let's get outta here!

493
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:06,110
- You all right, T.?
- Shh, it's okay.

494
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,160
It's okay. It's okay.

495
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,240
Shh. It's okay.

496
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,370
All right, all right,
all right, all right, all right.

497
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:18,170
- You all right?
- You know why they did this.

498
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,130
Shh. All right. Come on,
come on, come on, come on.

499
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,840
- I told you it was off the record.
- Nothin' with you is off the record!

500
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,540
- Look, I don't want to go into it right now.
- You ain't had no business talkin' to them people.

501
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,420
- You know everything that you say...
- All right, all right, all right, all right.

502
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,880
- They gon' make up something different.
- Mae, what you want me to do, huh?

503
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,470
- What you want me to do?
- Why do you say these things?

504
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,970
- I know what they doin'. I know exactly what they doin'.
- Are you trying to get us killed?

505
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,970
So what you want me to do, huh?

506
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,550
You want me to roll over
and just lay dead?

507
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,690
- Pride. It ain't nothin' but pride!
- You're damn right it's pride.

508
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,390
- I'm guilty.
- Give me my baby.

509
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,520
Shit.

510
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:09,460
<i>You will not be able
to stay home, brother</i>

511
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,210
<i>You will not be able to plug in
turn on and drop out</i>

512
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:19,260
<i>You will not be able to lose yourself on skag and skip out for beer during commercials</i>

513
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,930
<i>Because the revolution
will not be televised</i>

514
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,940
<i>The revolution will not be televised</i>

515
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,070
<i>The revolution will not be brought
to you by Xerox and ball parks</i>

516
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:32,570
<i>Without commercial interruptions</i>

517
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,410
<i>The revolution will not be right back after a message
about a white tornado white lightning or white people</i>

518
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:42,250
<i>You will not have to worry about a dove in your bedroom,
the tiger in your tank or the giant in your toilet bowl</i>

519
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,910
<i>The revolution
will not go better with Coke</i>

520
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,660
<i>The revolution will not fight germs
that may cause bad breath</i>

521
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,580
<i>- The revolution will put you in the driver's seat
- Break it up! Break it up!</i>

522
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,500
<i>The revolution will not be televised
Will not be televised</i>

523
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,960
<i>Will not be televised
Will not be televised</i>

524
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,520
<i>The revolution won't be no rerun, brothers The revolution will be live</i>

525
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:06,730
Champion of the world!
Champion of the world!

526
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,360
Yeah, they're still out.

527
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,090
I've seen a lot of things in my time,
but it's taken 35 minutes...

528
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,550
for these judges to tell us
what this home town crowd already knows.

529
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,190
Joey Giardello
is about to the lose the crown...

530
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,520
to Rubin "Hurricane" Carter.

531
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,600
Ladies and gentlemen...

532
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,150
it's a unanimous decision.

533
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:05,160
The winner
and still champion of the world...

534
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,500
Joey Giardello!

535
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,710
Giardello!

536
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:16,660
No. No, no. No. No.

537
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,250
Hey. What?

538
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,310
- You've stolen it!
- Aw, shit!

539
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:28,590
- This is bullshit!
- What's goin' on here?

540
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:32,940
- Yes, yes!
- Boo!

541
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:44,410
Well, all I can say
is these Philly judges...

542
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,780
must have been watching
a different fight...

543
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:51,240
because in the one we just saw,
Hurricane Carter took the title.

544
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:11,840
<i>Oh, now tell me
where can you party, child</i>

545
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,180
<i>- All night long
- In the basement</i>

546
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,310
<i>Down in the basement, yeah</i>

547
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,350
<i>Oh, where can you go
when your money gets low</i>

548
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:25,080
<i>In the basement
Whoa, down in the basement</i>

549
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,360
<i>And if a storm is takin'place
you can jam and still be safe</i>

550
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,500
<i>- In the basement, down in the basement
- I got somethin' special for you.</i>

551
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:37,790
- Hey, Hurricane, how you doin'?
- Hey, champ.

552
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,590
<i>In the basement
Down in the basement</i>

553
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,420
<i>- Oh, you got the comforts of home
- Anybody call a cab?</i>

554
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,470
<i>- A nightclub too
- In the basement</i>

555
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,470
<i>- Oh, down in the basement
- Anybody call a cab?</i>

556
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,090
I did, unless Rubin's
taking me home.

557
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,800
Yeah, if I take you,
it ain't gonna be home.

558
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:59,680
Mr Carter. M-Mr Carter.

559
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,820
- Headed 'cross town, Mr Carter?
- Yeah. Why? You need a ride?

560
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,190
- Wo- Would you mind?
- No, I wouldn't mind.

561
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,940
- All right! Okay.
- Come on.

562
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,150
- You drive.
- Drive your car?

563
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:13,910
- Come on.
- Oh, shit!

564
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,170
My friends are never gonna believe
I was cruising with The Hurricane.

565
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,750
- You know, what we wanna know is, can we get his autograph?
- No. No, no.

566
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,430
Oh, shit.

567
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,590
Motherfuckers.

568
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,850
- John, you been drinkin'?
- No. - All right.

569
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,970
All right, just relax.
Let me handle this.

570
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,560
All right.

571
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:39,070
Licence and registration.

572
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:01,950
It's okay. I got it.
You guys come with me.

573
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,760
B-E-L-L-O. Bello.

574
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,730
Bradley. B-R-A-D-L-E-Y.

575
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,820
Okay.

576
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:30,030
Are those the guys?

577
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,750
No?

578
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:36,250
Okay, let's go.

579
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,630
So what are you doing
around here at that hour?

580
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,250
Well, we was just out, you know,
takin' a walk, right?

581
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,720
- Yeah. Just gettin' a pack of cigarettes. That's it.
- Yeah.

582
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:57,300
Both of you are in big trouble.

583
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,360
You're in violation
of your parole.

584
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,530
But I don't wanna talk
about the burglary.

585
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:07,850
We'll talk about
your parole problem later, Bello.

586
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,860
As far as I'm concerned...

587
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:15,910
no proof a burglary
really took place.

588
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:19,670
See what I mean?

589
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,920
Yeah, I see what you mean.

590
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:31,510
I'm only interested
in the facts in this case...

591
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,560
and you and Bradley here are the only
two people that can really help me out.

592
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,810
Do you follow?

593
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,850
- Yeah, I follow.
- Good.

594
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:51,810
Now, is there any scenario
that you can imagine...

595
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:55,990
in which you could be sure...

596
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,370
really, positively sure...

597
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,070
that the man you saw that night...

598
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:07,090
was Rubin Carter?

599
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:26,390
Yeah, Rubin Carter. Yeah.

600
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,810
Wanna tell me again what happened? You were there having a drink? What was that?

601
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,070
No, no, it was, uh-

602
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,120
- I was goin' out for a pack of cigarettes.
- Yeah.

603
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,910
I heard a couple of shots, then I saw these two coloured guys, they come out of the bar.

604
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,650
And one of them was?

605
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,750
- One of them was Rubin Carter.
- Rubin Carter?

606
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:46,170
- Right, Rubin Carter, the fighter.
- Yeah, sure.

607
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:56,890
All rise.

608
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:03,230
The court will come to order.
The Honourable Judge Larner presiding.

609
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:05,730
Be seated.

610
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,640
The defendants will rise.

611
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,240
Rubin Carter...

612
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:25,990
although you still contend you are not guilty of the crimes charged against you...

613
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:30,840
you were afforded a full and fair trial
by a jury of your peers.

614
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:36,010
Have you reached a verdict?

615
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:41,210
Yes, we have, Your Honour.

616
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:44,550
We, the jury, find the defendants,
Rubin Carter...

617
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,690
and John Artis,
guilty on all counts.

618
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:50,060
Oh, no!

619
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:53,610
- No!
- That ain't right! He's innocent!

620
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,770
- Order.
- No!

621
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:03,190
- Order in the court.
- No!

622
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:07,280
- Order! Bailiff will see to it that order prevails.
- No! No!

623
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:10,200
This ain't right. Railroaded!

624
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:18,370
- No.
- Rubin Carter...

625
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:20,920
John Artis...

626
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,760
for the murder of James Oliver,
it is the court's sentence...

627
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:27,090
that you be imprisoned
for the remainder of your natural life.

628
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:29,190
No!

629
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:32,100
On the second count,
the murder of Fred Nauyaks...

630
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:35,930
you are sentenced to be imprisoned
for the remainder of your natural life.

631
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,200
No, God, no!

632
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:43,400
As to the third count involving
the murder of Hazel Tanis...

633
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,240
it is the sentence of this court
that you be imprisoned...

634
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:49,120
for the remainder
of your natural life.

635
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,760
Okay, Carter, let's go.

636
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:07,850
Take it easy.

637
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,350
You're a tough guy.

638
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:16,150
He thinks he's gonna stay in a room,
and that's it.

639
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:24,440
Put your clothes, your shoes, your ring, your watch and whatever else you've got in that bag.

640
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:28,700
You are being issued a standard inmate
uniform with your number sewn on it...

641
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:32,200
so that we can identify you
immediately.

642
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:34,910
And you'll go to have your facial hair
shaved. You know the rules.

643
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,370
No, I can't do it, Warden.

644
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,880
I beg your pardon?

645
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:45,010
I cannot do it.

646
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:49,880
Look, you have legal custody
over my body...

647
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,230
but I'm innocent.

648
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:56,760
I've committed no crime.
The crime's been committed against me.

649
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:01,570
And I will not wear the clothes
of a guilty man.

650
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,530
Now, I'll go anywhere you want me to go
in this penitentiary, Warden...

651
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:09,650
but you let it be known
in no uncertain terms...

652
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:15,070
that any man who tries
to put his hands on me-

653
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:18,880
This place is where we
tell you the rules.

654
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,220
You hear that?

655
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:26,210
Do you understand me?

656
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:28,880
Do you?

657
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:33,260
Because if you do,
you had better strip right now...

658
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:36,510
and put on that fucking uniform.

659
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:45,490
I can't do that.

660
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,990
Put this man in the hole.

661
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,700
Give him sufficient time
to reflect...

662
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:56,750
on how he intends to behave
in this institution.

663
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:01,000
Ninety days.

664
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:25,320
Hey, Bobby,
we've got another one for ya.

665
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:46,130
I like your suit.

666
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,740
Three, two...

667
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:56,650
one.

668
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:59,160
Lights-out.

669
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,710
You see?

670
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:08,670
"Though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil."

671
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,960
There's doubt.

672
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:14,540
The shadow is doubt.
The shadow is doubt.

673
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:21,680
But you're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me.

674
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:24,190
Lights-out.

675
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,900
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

676
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:33,030
You can't break me
'cause you didn't make me.

677
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,410
You understand? Huh?

678
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:47,630
You fucked everything up for everybody,
Rubin. It's all fucked-up.

679
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,260
Who's that?

680
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:01,520
Y'all ain't got no speakers in here.
Who is that?

681
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:08,140
I put us into this situation
any goddam way...

682
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:10,650
motherfucker.

683
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:15,190
I done fucked everything up for everybody. You know, that shit that's all fucked up.

684
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:19,900
What the fuck they expect us
to do now, huh? Motherfucker.

685
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,990
I'm s- I'm s- I'm scared.

686
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:35,840
Just shut up. Shut the fuck up,
you little skinny motherfucker.

687
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:38,890
You think your father used to beat
your little stuttering ass?

688
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:42,180
Don't make me
jump over there on ya.

689
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:45,840
No, you shut up.
Just shut the fuck up, talkin' to me.

690
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,600
Fuck you talkin' to? You ain't-
You ain't telling me what to say.

691
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:51,140
I'm running shit around here.
Fuck is wrong?

692
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:53,240
Ain't nobody runnin' shit.
I'm runnin' shit.

693
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,740
Shut the fuck up!

694
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:03,580
What you say?

695
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:07,210
No. No.

696
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:11,410
What are we gonna do now?

697
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:14,910
Huh?

698
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:17,880
I don't know what.

699
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,500
Shit, ain't nobody touchin' me.
No goddam soul touchin' me.

700
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,810
Put your hands on me not twice. You
better not put your fuckin' hands on me.

701
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:26,310
- I got-
- Shut up!

702
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:53,870
Oh, yeah. There's our man.
I can feel the hate. Can you feel it?

703
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,080
You can feel the hate, Rubin.
Don't you wanna just hurt somebody?

704
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,620
I feel like
I wanna kill somebody...

705
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,930
'cept there ain't nobody
in here to kill.

706
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:08,230
'Cept you, boy.

707
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:12,300
How 'bout it, Rube?

708
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,890
Get away from me!

709
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,810
All right, Carter. Time's up.

710
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:36,190
Jesus Christ.

711
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:41,310
You could really use a shower.

712
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:46,060
You smell awful, Mr Carter.
Why don't you take a shower?

713
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,650
Get you a decent cell
with a bed and some food.

714
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:53,400
- You'll feel a lot better.
- At what price do I, uh...

715
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,500
take this shower?

716
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:59,410
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what do I put on...

717
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:02,750
after I take this shower
that's gonna make me feel so good?

718
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:08,210
What everyone else puts on.
That's the rules.

719
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:13,930
Yeah, well, you can just take me
on back down to the hole.

720
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:24,900
You could die down there.

721
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:28,450
I could die up here too.

722
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:34,320
Look, what if I got you a pair
of pyjamas from the prison hospital?

723
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:40,000
As far as I'm concerned,
you'd be wearing prison-issued clothing.

724
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:49,720
They got stripes?

725
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,850
- No stripes.
- What 'bout numbers?

726
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:56,510
- No numbers.
- What colour are they?

727
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,510
They're white.

728
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:08,610
Okay, I can live with those.

729
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:16,080
- Thank you, Mr Carter.
- You're welcome, Mr Williams.

730
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,580
Shower's all yours.

731
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,580
Thank you.

732
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,300
It came to me as kind of a revelation
that my own freedom...

733
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:38,390
lay in not wanting or needing anything
of which they could deprive me.

734
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:42,270
If punishment consisted
of being locked in your cell...

735
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,850
then by simply choosing
to never leave my cell...

736
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:47,940
I deprived them of that weapon.

737
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:51,440
I would not work in their shops.
I would not eat their food.

738
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:56,450
I began to study. I dissected
my entire case piece by piece...

739
01:01:56,580 --> 01:02:00,360
beginning with my initial arrest
through the trial itself...

740
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,780
and finally to the awful verdict.

741
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,420
I didn't get a trial free from constitutional error and racial prejudice.

742
01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:09,920
He knows that. You know it.

743
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:12,370
That's not helpin' me
in here, Myron.

744
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:17,470
Look. Look, I'm innocent,
that's why.

745
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,920
Seven years! You're goddam right
it's seven years!

746
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:23,650
Just get me outta here.
I want a new trial. Okay?

747
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:28,970
The people united
will never be defeated.

748
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:33,100
The people united
will never be defeated.

749
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:36,410
The people united
will never be defeated.

750
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:38,490
The people united-

751
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:42,530
It shows that there's still hope.

752
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:46,090
There is hope for change
in America.

753
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:48,670
I believe in law and order,
and I believe that everybody...

754
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,500
has a right to,
uh, get another trial.

755
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:55,220
<i>Here comes the story
of T he Hurricane</i>

756
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:59,130
<i>The man the authorities
came to blame</i>

757
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:03,020
<i>- For something that he never done
- Give a hand for Miss Ellen Burstyn.</i>

758
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:05,680
<i>Put in a prison cell
but one time</i>

759
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:11,270
<i>He could have been
the champion of the world</i>

760
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:18,690
They ain't givin' up. They said
they're gonna demonstrate again.

761
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:22,080
Muhammad Ali and- and Ellen Burstyn.
Bob Dylan.

762
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,580
- Everybody.
- That's good, Mae.

763
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:27,080
Everybody.

764
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:33,470
Look, Mae, uh...

765
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:38,720
we've already lost two trials, and now they've turned down my request for an appeal.

766
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:47,430
I'm sorry. It, uh- It's over.

767
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,940
It's finished.

768
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,100
I'm gonna die in here,
Mae, so-

769
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,730
- Baby, listen, there is still a chance.
- Listen to me now.

770
01:03:56,860 --> 01:04:01,440
- Now, all we have to do is hang on.
- There's nothin' to hang on to.

771
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:06,570
I want you to divorce me,
understand?

772
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:10,130
And I don't want you
to come back down here.

773
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:14,880
- No. No, now you listen to me.
- Mae, don't make- don't make this-

774
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:17,330
There- There are still things
that we can do.

775
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:21,090
- We just gotta get you out of here.
- I am not gonna be a weight hanging around your neck.

776
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:26,270
- You are no weight around my neck!
- Well, then you're a weight around mine.

777
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:30,220
Now, I can't do all the years
I gotta do in here...

778
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:34,850
knowin' that they can take your beautiful face away from me anytime they want to.

779
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:38,600
- You understand?
- Rubin.

780
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:41,770
I ain't walkin' away from you.

781
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,700
I'm dead.

782
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,380
- Rubin.
- Just bury me, please.

783
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:04,430
Rubin?

784
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:08,590
Rubin.

785
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:12,430
Rubin, we're- we're in this together
now. We just gotta hang on.

786
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:15,180
Guard.

787
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:18,070
Rubin.

788
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:20,860
Rubin?

789
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:24,660
We just gotta hang on.

790
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:27,160
We just gotta hang on.

791
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:38,410
I will bend time to my own clock.

792
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:40,710
When the prisoners awake,
I will sleep.

793
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,840
When they sleep, I will wake.

794
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:47,560
I will live neither in their cell...

795
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:51,050
nor in my own heart...

796
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:54,270
only in my mind...

797
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,010
and my spirit.

798
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:59,900
"Once I reached my hand out for help.

799
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:02,600
It came down and then withered...

800
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:07,120
as dry grass blown away into dust
leaving nothin'.

801
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,830
Now I wait for nothin'.
I need nothin'.

802
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:15,670
Not tomorrow, not freedom,
not justice.

803
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:19,920
In the end,
the prison will vanish...

804
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:23,580
and there'll be no more Rubin...

805
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:26,010
no more Carter...

806
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:29,060
only The Hurricane.

807
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:31,930
And after him...

808
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,440
there is no more."

809
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:42,270
Man, what are we gonna do?

810
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,310
- About what?
- About The Hurricane, that's what.

811
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:49,280
Well, there's not much
we can do, Lesra.

812
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:54,400
B- But the man's innocent, yet he's been
in jail 15, 16 years. That's not right.

813
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:00,200
- I know that's what his book says.
- Uh, two juries found him guilty, Les.

814
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:03,870
- Yeah, two white juries.
- Hey, hey, not all white people are racists.

815
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:06,760
Not all black people are murderers.

816
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,140
Look, I just- I just want
to write him a letter...

817
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:22,780
and tell him how much his book
meant to me, that's all.

818
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:32,910
<i>I know you told me</i>

819
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:35,870
<i>- Such a long time ago
- Dear...</i>

820
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:41,700
<i>- Mr Hurricane.
- That you want me</i>

821
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,210
<i>- You don't love me no more
- No, that's really stupid.</i>

822
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:53,630
<i>- I wanna know
- What's that?</i>

823
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:58,270
<i>- It's ten dollars, U.S.
- Oh, what you mean to me</i>

824
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:01,180
<i>- I thought he might need some money for stamps...
- Believe me, darlin'</i>

825
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:03,310
if you want him
to write you back.

826
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,280
<i>Oh-oh, no</i>

827
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,320
Yeah. Yeah, write me back.

828
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:13,740
<i>- That's cool. Thanks, Lisa.
- I know you told me</i>

829
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:16,250
No problem.

830
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:26,880
<i>- Dear Mr Rubin Carter.
- And I know</i>

831
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,580
I read your book...

832
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:37,050
and I really felt sad
about what happened to you.

833
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:43,300
I want you to know
how much your book meant to me.

834
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:47,390
<i>Little baby, child
move you</i>

835
01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:50,480
<i>Whoa-whoa-whoa</i>

836
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:52,990
<i>Please</i>

837
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,920
It's here! Hey, he wrote us back!
It's here!

838
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:54,830
It's here! He wrote us back!
Home of the brave!

839
01:09:54,970 --> 01:09:57,500
Land of the free!
He wrote us back!

840
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:01,420
- Can you stand it?
- Well, open it already.

841
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:05,060
I don't know.
You think I should?

842
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:16,310
"Dear Lesra...

843
01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:20,070
please forgive
the seemingly tardy reply...

844
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:23,620
but he who bemoans
the lack of opportunity...

845
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:28,830
forgets that small doors
many times open up into large rooms.

846
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:36,220
It was not only thoughtful,
but insightful on your part.

847
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:40,500
Stamps, paper and envelopes...

848
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:44,140
were exactly what was needed
to complete this transmission.

849
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:52,140
Your letter, feelings,
concerns, desires and warmth...

850
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,680
literally
jumped off the page at me...

851
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:57,520
when reading
your heartfelt message.

852
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:00,150
It is as if you heard
my thoughts...

853
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:02,690
and reached out
to share yours with me...

854
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:06,820
at a moment when I can hear you.

855
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,920
So thank you once again.

856
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,880
Forever...

857
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,500
your friend and brother...

858
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:19,010
Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter."

859
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:24,710
Wow.

860
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:26,560
You got your answer.

861
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,230
Yeah.

862
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:34,780
Dear Rubin...

863
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:39,200
I've been thinking about my life
compared to yours.

864
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:42,330
I come from Bushwick in Brooklyn.

865
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:47,330
My parents are alcoholics
and my brother's in prison.

866
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:50,960
I was third in my class,
and I couldn't even read.

867
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:54,920
I couldn't write you this letter
just a year ago...

868
01:11:55,050 --> 01:12:00,470
but then I met these friends from Canada
when I had a summer job at the EPA.

869
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:04,010
They offered to educate me
and they got me out.

870
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:10,880
Sometimes I feel guilty about my family
'cause I left 'em behind.

871
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:15,680
Now that I know you,
I know it isn't right.

872
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:19,020
I shouldn't cry
about my own feelings...

873
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:22,160
not if you can do what you've done.

874
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,330
I've been thinkin' though.

875
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:28,400
I would like to come and visit you,
if that will be all right.

876
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,960
Palm down, right hand.
Keep the line moving.

877
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,380
- Put your right hand out, please. Palm down.
- Keep the line moving.

878
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,500
- Keep the line moving, please.
- Come on. Come on.

879
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:24,090
Okay, now.

880
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:33,810
Y'all listen up now. Visits for Jones,
Taylor, Harris, Ramos...

881
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:37,690
Sykes, Carter, Tucei,
line up right here.

882
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:40,060
Uh, you didn't call my boy's name.

883
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:42,940
Hemmings. Eric Hemmings, 65660.

884
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:45,280
- Hemmings?
- Yeah.

885
01:13:45,410 --> 01:13:49,570
Uh-uh, no visit for Hemmings today.
He's in lockup.

886
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:53,910
- Okay, Mac, open it up.
- Keep out of the way.

887
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:10,720
Extend your arms. Palms.
Turn around.

888
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:13,930
Show me your feet.
Okay, spread 'em.

889
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:16,440
Next.

890
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:24,520
Open your mouth.
Roll your tongue.

891
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:27,570
Extend your arms.

892
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:30,230
Show me your palms.
Turn around.

893
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:34,910
Show me your feet.

894
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,360
Spread 'em.

895
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,880
Ready on the outside!

896
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:44,250
Okay, come on.
Single file, y'all.

897
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:47,830
Let's go. Single file.

898
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:50,540
Hey, sweetheart!

899
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,920
Single file.

900
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:55,430
Let's go. Single file.

901
01:14:58,730 --> 01:15:01,110
You look nice.

902
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:35,680
Mr Carter?

903
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:40,380
- Rubin "Hurricane" Carter. Is that you?
- Mm-hmm.

904
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:44,980
- I'm sorry, you don't look like your pictures. I thought you'd be bigger.
- Hey, I'm bigger than you.

905
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:50,850
- But don't tell anybody, okay?
- All- All right.

906
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,370
Okay. Sit down.

907
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:08,120
- Hey, this is some place, man.
- No.

908
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:12,920
No, it's not. This is no place,
not for a human being.

909
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:16,890
Don't ever get used to
a place like this, Lesra.

910
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:19,340
You got a lot of guts, kid.

911
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:24,400
Takes a lot of courage to come
all the way down here by yourself.

912
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,100
I'm impressed.

913
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:31,980
- I was scared you weren't gonna let me come.
- Me too.

914
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:34,350
But you're Rubin "Hurricane" Carter.
What would you be scared of?

915
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:38,160
Well, doors opening,
of the light outside...

916
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:41,570
of you.

917
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:43,950
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

918
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,540
- Mr Carter, I don't understand.
- Oh, no, no, no, don't call me Mr Carter.

919
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:49,130
- Call me Rube.
- Rube?

920
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:52,540
Yeah. Rube.

921
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:56,580
All right. Rube.

922
01:16:58,510 --> 01:17:01,880
So, tell me about these folks
you're livin' with.

923
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:04,590
- Oh, the Canadians. - Yes.
- Yeah, I got pictures of'em.

924
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:07,850
Here.

925
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:11,600
This is Sam, this is Terry,
and this is Lisa.

926
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:14,110
- They're the greatest, man.
- Huh.

927
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:17,940
Yeah, I met 'em at an EPA in Brooklyn,
and, you know, they was doin' business.

928
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:21,750
They brought me home and stuff,
and the rest is what happened, man.

929
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,870
Yeah, that's when
my life changed, Rube.

930
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,200
Just yanked a brother up and took him
up to Canada, just like that?

931
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:30,910
No, no, they asked my folks.

932
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:33,800
I see. So what do they do?
Are they a religious group...

933
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,540
or, uh, hippies or a commune or-

934
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,290
No, they fix up houses and sell 'em.
You know?

935
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:41,750
- They're just people.
- Just people.

936
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:45,260
Just workin', eatin',
livin' together?

937
01:17:45,390 --> 01:17:48,430
I don't know. This is what they do, man.
That's their thing.

938
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,850
- What'd your folks say?
- Oh, well, my dad, you know, he's happy.

939
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:54,060
- He's glad for me.
- Oh, good.

940
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:56,150
You see 'em much,
your people, your folks?

941
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,320
Yeah, but sometimes
it's hard though.

942
01:17:58,450 --> 01:18:01,070
Yeah, well-

943
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,580
Yeah, it's hard.

944
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:08,360
You give them hope.

945
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:12,660
- Yeah, I guess.
- You do. You give 'em hope.

946
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,630
Because you have transcended, Lesra.

947
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,890
It is very important to transcend
the places that hold us.

948
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:24,800
You know that? You've learned to read.
You've learned to write.

949
01:18:24,930 --> 01:18:27,850
Writing is- it's magic.

950
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:33,350
You feel that sometimes?

951
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:36,020
- Yeah, I guess I do.
- Mm-hmm.

952
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:38,530
When I started writing...

953
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:44,540
I discovered that I was doing more
than just telling a story.

954
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:46,870
See, writing is a weapon...

955
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,250
and it's more powerful
than a fist can ever be.

956
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:54,750
Every time I sat down to write, I could
rise above the walls of this prison.

957
01:18:54,880 --> 01:19:00,720
I could look out over the walls
all across the state of New Jersey.

958
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,880
And I could see Nelson Mandela
in his cell writing his book.

959
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:07,550
I could see Huey.
I could see Dostoyevsky.

960
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:11,520
I could see Victor Hugo, Emile Zola,
and- and they would say to me...

961
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:13,800
"Rubin, what you doin' in there?"

962
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:16,940
And I say,
"Hey, I know all you guys."

963
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:22,240
It's magic, Lesra.

964
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:25,480
Mmm, they sure don't teach it
that way up in Canada.

965
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:28,950
- Maybe you could tell me some books to read.
- I can do that.

966
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:32,080
But these people in Canada or anywhere
else, they can only teach you so much.

967
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:35,410
It's up to you. It's your search. You
gotta find out what's true for you...

968
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:40,420
what is true for Lesra Martin.

969
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:44,170
I never met nobody like you before.

970
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:50,340
You think I killed
those people, son?

971
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:55,520
- No, I know you didn't.
- How you know?

972
01:19:55,650 --> 01:19:57,970
I just know.

973
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:07,070
I'm so glad I met you, Lesra.

974
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:11,370
Me too.

975
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:15,960
Visit's up.

976
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,080
Everybody out.

977
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:22,080
Come on, folks. Let's go.

978
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:24,710
You like a quick picture
of you and your son, Mr Carter?

979
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,630
- Come on, folks. Let's go.
- It's up to my son.

980
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,140
Yeah, all right. All right.

981
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:36,100
That's enough pictures.
Come on. Let's go.

982
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:20,900
Dear Lesra...

983
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:26,360
whoever is responsible for your present
condition obviously cares a great deal.

984
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:31,370
For me, it was a miracle to see
such light in a human being again.

985
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:36,290
When you came, it was like the day
had started off without the sun.

986
01:21:36,410 --> 01:21:38,820
It's dim and it's cool.

987
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,490
Then suddenly,
and without any warning...

988
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:45,760
the sunshine breaks through the dimness
and lights up everything.

989
01:21:55,890 --> 01:22:00,220
<i>What ya gonna do
Do you wanna get down</i>

990
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:03,190
<i>What ya gonna do
Do you wanna get down</i>

991
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,560
You been all around the world,
huh, Mobutu?

992
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:09,600
- Been everywhere.
- Shut your motherfuckin' mouth up!

993
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:13,080
<i>Get down on it
Get down on it</i>

994
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:16,570
<i>- Come on and get down on it
- Where your people from, Africa?</i>

995
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:19,660
Born in the Congo. Mm-hmm.

996
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:22,170
In the blackness of black.

997
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:27,200
My mother was a Pygmy.
She stood four foot, one inch.

998
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:31,120
- Hmm.
- My father was a big Watusi.

999
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,420
He was seven foot, ten.

1000
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:38,430
He'd have to pick her up
like a little child to kiss her.

1001
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,560
<i>- Hmm, cute.
- Get down on it</i>

1002
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:43,680
<i>Come on now
Get down on it</i>

1003
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:46,220
<i>If you really want it
get down on it</i>

1004
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,820
What do you think of white folks?

1005
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:56,200
They're just a little bit too much
of this stuff, you know?

1006
01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:59,250
But, uh, then again...

1007
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:04,250
I once rode the rails
with a hobo by the name of, um...

1008
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:06,670
Alabama.

1009
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,800
Now, he was white folks...

1010
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:13,120
and he was a good man.

1011
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:17,810
Mm-hmm. He saved my life
three times.

1012
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:21,800
- Three times?
- Mm-hmm. Three times.

1013
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:27,560
Three times life, huh?

1014
01:23:27,690 --> 01:23:30,230
Everything I lost...

1015
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:34,770
that really matters
I lost at the hand of white folks.

1016
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:37,830
I know what you mean...

1017
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:40,620
but they ain't all bad.

1018
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:46,200
<i>What ya wanna do
Do you wanna get down</i>

1019
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:51,170
<i>- What ya gonna do
- But they sure can't dance.</i>

1020
01:23:54,550 --> 01:23:57,550
Oh, shit.

1021
01:23:57,680 --> 01:23:59,310
Mm-hmm.

1022
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,970
Hey, y'all,
th-this is where we go in.

1023
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:07,890
Come on.

1024
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:10,400
Come on!

1025
01:24:10,530 --> 01:24:14,030
- Don't look now, but we're being watched.
- Stop it.

1026
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:19,030
Somehow I don't think
you can smoke in there.

1027
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:23,330
Right over there.

1028
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:27,910
Hey, Rube, man, we made it.
How you doin', man?

1029
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,250
All right.

1030
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:33,630
- Sam.
- Hey, Rubin. Good to meet you.

1031
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:36,000
Yeah. Good, good, good.

1032
01:24:36,130 --> 01:24:38,830
- Professor.
- Yeah.

1033
01:24:38,970 --> 01:24:41,180
- This is Terry.
- Terry.

1034
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:44,420
- Nice to meet you.
- It's my pleasure, Terry. Heard a lot about you.

1035
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,180
- Lisa.
- Lisa.

1036
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:51,720
So, you don't look like
I thought you would look.

1037
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:56,310
Lesra said you were so tough.

1038
01:24:56,450 --> 01:25:01,870
- Is that good?
- Don't know. Don't know.

1039
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:04,530
Don't know. Come on.

1040
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,370
Sit down.

1041
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,600
Everybody together!
I can't stand it.

1042
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:24,210
So, uh, Rubin,
how's the appeal goin'?

1043
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:28,680
Uh, we hear it's with the New Jersey
Supreme Court. Have they set a date?

1044
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:33,230
Why don't we talk about Lesra?

1045
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:36,940
I'm sure that Lesra wants to know
what's happening with your case too.

1046
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:40,520
My case is doing what it's doing.

1047
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:44,110
I have to focus on the fact
that I have to do the time.

1048
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:48,360
Well, how do you do that?

1049
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:55,090
How do I do that? I do that by not
allowing myself to want or to need...

1050
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:58,090
anything.

1051
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:03,040
I'm free in here because
there's nothing I want out here.

1052
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:07,420
Not free to want?
Not free to risk human contact?

1053
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,940
This place doesn't allow you
to be human.

1054
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:14,690
The only contact you get in here is gettin' stabbed in the back or gang-raped in the shower.

1055
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:20,060
That's what they've reduced you to. I mean, you've
obviously elevated it to something else with Lesra.

1056
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:23,060
Yeah, because of you, Rube,
I wanna be a lawyer when I grow up...

1057
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,160
and prove you innocent.

1058
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,490
Except we don't have to wait till I'm a lawyer, Rube, because these guys want to help, man.

1059
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:33,110
- We all believe in your innocence.
- I've been innocent for 16 years.

1060
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:38,540
That's how long I've been in here. Innocence is a highly overrated commodity.

1061
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:41,250
None of us can judge what you've been
through, but you might wanna consider-

1062
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:43,710
You're damn right none of you can judge
what I've been through...

1063
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,970
because none of you
have been through it.

1064
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:49,180
What do you know about doing time?
Tell me about it.

1065
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:52,890
What do you know about what it is to be me? What do you
- What do you know about being in this place?

1066
01:26:53,020 --> 01:26:56,690
- Hey, this is too much, you guys.
- Yeah, you're right. This is too much.

1067
01:26:56,820 --> 01:27:00,020
Um, y'all, look,
let's just go, all right?

1068
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:08,980
- Rubin. Rubin. Rubin.
- Right there.

1069
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:12,320
Hey, listen, we left a package
for you in the mail room.

1070
01:27:37,770 --> 01:27:40,150
Yes.

1071
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:58,070
Visitors left this for you
in the mail room.

1072
01:27:58,210 --> 01:28:01,990
We had to open it
'cause of security.

1073
01:28:02,130 --> 01:28:04,510
Nice to have friends.

1074
01:28:21,610 --> 01:28:24,280
"Special gift for The Hurricane."

1075
01:28:31,450 --> 01:28:34,570
Don't trust 'em, Rubin.

1076
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:36,910
Don't trust 'em.

1077
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:48,970
You trust a bunch of little white-ass
do-gooders more than you trust me...

1078
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:51,790
more than you trust us.

1079
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:55,560
Yeah. No more hate.

1080
01:28:57,560 --> 01:28:59,520
Try that on, huh?

1081
01:28:59,650 --> 01:29:02,650
Don't trust 'em, Rubin.
They'll turn on ya. Don't trust 'em, no.

1082
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:06,190
- Think me and you. Me and you.
- See how that fits.

1083
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:12,020
- It's time.
- For what?

1084
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,290
It's time for you to go.

1085
01:29:16,410 --> 01:29:20,660
Don't you turn your back on me,
nigger.

1086
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:23,170
Rubin!

1087
01:29:23,290 --> 01:29:25,120
Rubin!

1088
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:28,040
Ladies and gentlemen...

1089
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:30,550
in this corner-

1090
01:29:32,050 --> 01:29:35,810
<i>In this corner,
from Paterson, New Jersey...</i>

1091
01:29:35,930 --> 01:29:38,720
<i>wearing the white trunks
with black stripes...</i>

1092
01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:41,060
<i>Rubin "Hurricane" Carter!</i>

1093
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:57,030
- Okay, Sam. Are you joining us?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1094
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:59,120
- Lesra, get up back.
- Dear Rubin...

1095
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:02,170
- I can't believe the warmth and beauty of your letter.
- Ready?

1096
01:30:02,290 --> 01:30:05,380
We get a rich, deep feeling
of experiencing your presence.

1097
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:09,370
You've- You've made what we've
been saying the truth-

1098
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:12,000
that you can't keep people back
who refuse to be kept back.

1099
01:30:12,130 --> 01:30:13,790
Here we go. Here we go.

1100
01:30:13,930 --> 01:30:17,880
We work out of our home, so we're
always here if you'd like to call.

1101
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:20,590
We'd really like
to hear your voice.

1102
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:23,730
You are very persuasive...

1103
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:27,390
and I thank you
for all the things you send me...

1104
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,810
but you people
are a bad influence on me.

1105
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:34,700
I'm startin' to like all this stuff
a little too much.

1106
01:30:34,820 --> 01:30:37,320
You're lettin' me get loose.

1107
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:49,840
Hello?

1108
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:54,290
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.
Hey, Rube, what's happening, man?

1109
01:30:54,430 --> 01:30:59,630
Lesra, boy, you, uh- Well,
you sound more like a man every day.

1110
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:03,100
Get outta here.

1111
01:31:03,230 --> 01:31:06,510
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, you know Canadians, man.

1112
01:31:06,650 --> 01:31:10,510
They're not happy unless they're outside,
you know, rakin' leaves or tappin' a tree for maple syrup.

1113
01:31:10,650 --> 01:31:12,640
I don't know how they do it, man.
It's cold out there too.

1114
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:15,450
Hey, what's up, Rube?
Something happen?

1115
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:18,490
Yeah, I, um...

1116
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:21,230
heard from the courts, Lesra.

1117
01:31:21,370 --> 01:31:24,320
Been denied. I lost the appeal.

1118
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:29,170
Oh, no, man. Well-Well,
look, look, look, hold on, Rube.

1119
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:31,830
- Let me tell everyone, okay?
- I gotta go, little brother.

1120
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:34,750
No, well, wait, Rube!
W- Wait! Wait. Wait. But, Rube!

1121
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:37,370
Rubin!

1122
01:31:37,510 --> 01:31:40,460
What's going on?

1123
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:49,190
Lost the appeal.

1124
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:54,610
Oh, no.

1125
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:12,200
Dear Lesra, Terry, Sam...

1126
01:32:13,710 --> 01:32:16,330
Lisa...

1127
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:20,330
this is, in many ways, the saddest
letter I've ever had to write.

1128
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:25,710
I appreciate your many efforts
and kindnesses...

1129
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:28,140
but I am a prisoner.

1130
01:32:28,270 --> 01:32:32,480
My number is 45472, and my job,
the key to my survival-

1131
01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:37,740
"My number is 45472, and my job,
the key to my survival...

1132
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:41,450
lies in my ability to do the time.

1133
01:32:41,570 --> 01:32:45,980
This place is not one in which humanity
can survive. Only steel can.

1134
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:51,710
This will be my last letter to you.

1135
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:55,340
Please do not write.
Please do not visit.

1136
01:32:56,710 --> 01:33:02,080
Please find it in your hearts
to not weaken me with your love.

1137
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:04,210
Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter."

1138
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:11,800
Open up, Ken.

1139
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:14,100
Okay.

1140
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:18,100
Thanks.

1141
01:33:28,950 --> 01:33:31,250
Rubin.

1142
01:33:33,130 --> 01:33:36,330
I got a letter here
for you from Canada.

1143
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:41,380
I'm just gonna slide it
in here for you.

1144
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:48,050
You do what you want with it.

1145
01:33:59,730 --> 01:34:01,980
"Dear Rube...

1146
01:34:02,110 --> 01:34:04,570
I know you asked us not to write...

1147
01:34:04,700 --> 01:34:06,860
so I'm not writing...

1148
01:34:06,990 --> 01:34:09,690
just sending you two things.

1149
01:34:09,830 --> 01:34:14,070
One's a picture of me
and my new girlfriend, Pauline.

1150
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:17,620
The other...

1151
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:21,200
is something that
rightfully belongs to you-

1152
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:24,210
my high school diploma.

1153
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:28,890
Your friend and brother forever,
Lesra Martin."

1154
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:54,870
<i>Don't count the stars</i>

1155
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,240
<i>Or you might stumble</i>

1156
01:35:05,430 --> 01:35:07,670
Hello.

1157
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:13,420
Yes, I accept-
I-I accept the charges.

1158
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:21,140
Rubin? Hey.

1159
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:27,270
R- Rubin, I-I-I can't hear you.

1160
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:38,830
Rube-

1161
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:41,120
Hello?

1162
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:54,300
He said he can't do the time.

1163
01:36:29,010 --> 01:36:31,220
Uh, collect call to anyone...

1164
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:34,630
from Mr Rubin Carter.

1165
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:38,210
- Get it. Get it.
- Take one.

1166
01:36:38,350 --> 01:36:40,430
<i>- Yes.
- Rubin?</i>

1167
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:44,430
<i>- Lesra?
- No, it's Terry. I'm here with Lisa and Sam, and Lesra's here.</i>

1168
01:36:44,570 --> 01:36:46,610
Hey. How y'all doin'?

1169
01:36:46,730 --> 01:36:49,850
<i>Look out the window.</i>

1170
01:36:49,990 --> 01:36:51,950
What?

1171
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:55,910
<i>You see that light?
The one that's blinking?</i>

1172
01:36:56,030 --> 01:36:58,330
<i>You see it?</i>

1173
01:36:58,450 --> 01:37:00,580
Yeah.

1174
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:04,130
<i>Can you see Lesra?</i>

1175
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:13,250
Yeah, I see you.
What are y'all doin' here?

1176
01:37:14,970 --> 01:37:18,000
- Can he see us?
- Yeah, he can see you.

1177
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:22,230
- Rube!
- We're here.

1178
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:24,510
We've moved down here.

1179
01:37:26,570 --> 01:37:30,240
<i>- For what? - We 're in this thing
full-time until you walk out of there.</i>

1180
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:32,820
<i>Hold on.
Lisa wants to say something.</i>

1181
01:37:32,950 --> 01:37:35,240
Hurricane!

1182
01:37:35,370 --> 01:37:37,830
Hey, Rube.

1183
01:37:37,950 --> 01:37:41,070
<i>Looks like you got
some foot soldiers now, huh?</i>

1184
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:48,240
We're all in this together,
and we're not leaving till we all leave.

1185
01:37:52,970 --> 01:37:55,430
You're beautiful.

1186
01:37:55,550 --> 01:37:58,640
We're gonna take you home.

1187
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:01,340
Okay.

1188
01:38:03,810 --> 01:38:06,560
Okay.

1189
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:26,210
Rubin has, uh, asked us to give you
copies of everything that we have...

1190
01:38:26,330 --> 01:38:28,290
and to answer any questions.

1191
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:32,040
And since we've represented him
for over ten years...

1192
01:38:32,170 --> 01:38:34,130
there's an awful lot of material.

1193
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:37,590
I mean, we have rooms
full of files.

1194
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:39,880
Absolutely.
And, uh, please understand...

1195
01:38:40,010 --> 01:38:43,300
that we are not here
to second-guess you or-

1196
01:38:43,430 --> 01:38:47,510
You know, we- we've come down here
to help in any way we can.

1197
01:38:47,650 --> 01:38:50,730
Anything, you know.
Anything at all.

1198
01:38:55,990 --> 01:38:57,950
Well, that's very kind of you.

1199
01:38:58,070 --> 01:39:02,120
And I congratulate you
on your dedication to Rubin's case.

1200
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:04,490
Uh, maybe I should add
that in those ten years...

1201
01:39:04,620 --> 01:39:07,000
we've been working on this,
we've donated our services.

1202
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:09,660
We've never asked for a dime.
We never expect one. Do we?

1203
01:39:09,790 --> 01:39:12,660
- No.
- I wanted to be sure.

1204
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:16,330
And also in that time, uh,
there have been a lot of people...

1205
01:39:16,470 --> 01:39:18,870
great people...

1206
01:39:19,010 --> 01:39:21,300
all well-intentioned.

1207
01:39:21,430 --> 01:39:23,390
- Famous.
- Infamous.

1208
01:39:23,510 --> 01:39:27,730
Or not. Boxers, singers,
writers, actors...

1209
01:39:27,850 --> 01:39:29,900
journalists, et cetera.

1210
01:39:30,020 --> 01:39:33,110
A lot of brave people
who gave their time...

1211
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:37,280
and, to some degree,
risked their reputations.

1212
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:40,570
People like you.

1213
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:43,020
And, uh...

1214
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:48,120
people come and go,
and, frankly, nobody lasts.

1215
01:39:49,670 --> 01:39:52,370
Nobody stays the course.

1216
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:57,460
Nobody goes the distance,
because it's too tough.

1217
01:39:57,590 --> 01:40:00,050
It's too slow...

1218
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:03,350
and it's heartbreaking.

1219
01:40:03,470 --> 01:40:07,520
- It's too heartbreaking.
- Well, with all due respect, Mr Friedman...

1220
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:11,690
what you have to understand
is that we're here.

1221
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:16,810
We've moved here, and we have every intention of staying here until Rubin is free.

1222
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:19,560
Right on.

1223
01:40:21,070 --> 01:40:25,120
So we finally got in to see your lawyers, Beldock and Friedman, the other day.

1224
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:29,150
- How'd they take it?
- Oh, I'd say we handled ourselves pretty well.

1225
01:40:29,290 --> 01:40:33,240
Yeah, well, we hauled about what, ten
tons of documents, into the apartment.

1226
01:40:33,380 --> 01:40:36,800
- In broad daylight? - Yeah. - Oh,
yeah. - Wait a minute. Listen to me.

1227
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:39,790
This is not Canada.

1228
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:42,960
Now, I can protect you in here...

1229
01:40:43,090 --> 01:40:46,540
but there's not much
I can do for you on the outside.

1230
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:48,720
The only way I'm ever leaving
this place is if...

1231
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:51,630
a lot of very important people
are exposed.

1232
01:40:51,770 --> 01:40:54,890
They're not gonna
just let that happen.

1233
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:58,470
- You understand?
- We'll be careful.

1234
01:40:58,610 --> 01:41:02,140
Okay. Well, why don't you walk us
through what happened that night?

1235
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:07,190
Now, three cops have testified
the shooting occurred at 2:45.

1236
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:11,450
- So, uh, what time did you leave the Nite Spot?
- 2:30.

1237
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:16,380
<i>Oh, now tell me where can you party
child, all night long</i>

1238
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:20,410
<i>- In the basement
- Anybody call a cab?</i>

1239
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:23,630
<i>- Oh, where did you go
- Time for me to get outta here.</i>

1240
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:26,710
- How much do I owe you, Big Ed?
- Your money's no good here, champ.

1241
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:30,970
- Anybody call a cab?
- I did, unless Rubin's taking me home.

1242
01:41:32,930 --> 01:41:35,720
If I take you,
it's gonna be more than home.

1243
01:41:35,850 --> 01:41:38,180
Get on outta here, girl.

1244
01:41:38,310 --> 01:41:40,140
Shit.

1245
01:41:40,270 --> 01:41:43,560
What were you doin' out so late
on a Thursday night?

1246
01:41:43,700 --> 01:41:47,060
- What does it matter what night it was?
- Wasn't Thursday night ladies' night?

1247
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:50,070
Didn't it matter to your wife?

1248
01:41:51,490 --> 01:41:55,570
I'm in the penitentiary for murder,
not attempted adultery.

1249
01:42:00,670 --> 01:42:05,050
So there was a cab there.
He must have seen you leave, right?

1250
01:42:05,170 --> 01:42:08,680
No. No, he left before I did.

1251
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:11,420
- Hey.
- Poor daddy goin' home.

1252
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:17,180
- Bye, Rubin.
- Take it easy.

1253
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:20,100
- Hey, champ.
- Huh? Hey!

1254
01:42:22,110 --> 01:42:24,270
Whoa! He's gone!

1255
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:31,230
I wish to God John Artis
had met a girl that night.

1256
01:42:31,370 --> 01:42:36,030
I wish that, uh,
he hadn't been there at all.

1257
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:40,240
He didn't deserve this.
He didn't deserve any of it.

1258
01:42:42,710 --> 01:42:45,290
Artis, let's go. You're done.

1259
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:48,000
He got the same sentence I got,
and all he had to do...

1260
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:51,720
was lie and say I killed
those people and...

1261
01:42:51,850 --> 01:42:56,920
they would have let him out
and his nightmare would have been over.

1262
01:42:57,060 --> 01:43:00,680
Most men couldn't have stood up
to that kind of torture...

1263
01:43:02,270 --> 01:43:04,320
but John Artis did.

1264
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:06,820
The man is my hero.

1265
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:16,610
So the police said it was 2:45
or a little after...

1266
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:18,820
when all hell broke loose
at the Lafayette bar.

1267
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:21,490
That's what they said.

1268
01:43:21,630 --> 01:43:25,160
Apparently, the two gunmen entered the
bar and immediately started shooting.

1269
01:43:35,310 --> 01:43:40,190
According to William Marins,
two guys barged in and just opened fire.

1270
01:43:40,310 --> 01:43:43,230
Oliver goes down first.

1271
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,820
Nauyaks.

1272
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:48,940
Then Marins was the only one
who got a look at 'em.

1273
01:43:49,070 --> 01:43:51,310
Then they shoot Hazel Tanis
and leave.

1274
01:43:58,410 --> 01:44:03,290
- What's Bello doing?
- Bello was a lookout for a burglary up the street.

1275
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:10,880
- And who else saw anything?
- Patty Valentine.

1276
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:14,010
She said she saw the getaway car.

1277
01:44:18,770 --> 01:44:22,380
And there was a man who lived across the
street by the name of Avery Cockersham.

1278
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,680
Cockersham? That name
was in the police report.

1279
01:44:24,810 --> 01:44:27,730
- That's right.
- So how come he didn't testify?

1280
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:31,230
The judge threw
the police report out.

1281
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:34,030
Cockersham left town.
Nobody could find him.

1282
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:38,000
It was two coloured guys. They just
walked in, they started shootin'.

1283
01:45:38,140 --> 01:45:40,600
Call the cops.

1284
01:45:54,150 --> 01:45:58,610
Now, according to the police,
the murders were racially motivated.

1285
01:45:58,740 --> 01:46:02,160
See, the bar didn't serve blacks, so naturally this crazy nigger, Rubin Carter...

1286
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:05,570
had to take out his vengeance
on the entire white race.

1287
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:12,280
Uh, this is, uh, Exhibit 11-F.

1288
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:14,490
- This is 1966. - Wait a minute. What are
you talking about? Where are- Where are you?

1289
01:46:14,630 --> 01:46:16,620
- Trial transcripts, 1966.
- Oh. Stick to the blue cards.

1290
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:19,220
- Valentine- Valentine first said...
- I know the blue cards.

1291
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:21,550
The car's taillights
were similar to the getaway car.

1292
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:26,230
- "Similar." - Right. Then in '76,
Exhibit 89-C, she says, quote...

1293
01:46:26,350 --> 01:46:29,550
"The Carter car was unquestionably
the same car. There was no doubt."

1294
01:46:29,690 --> 01:46:31,650
- Closed quote.
- Exactly.

1295
01:46:31,770 --> 01:46:33,680
Kinda makes you wonder, doesn't it?

1296
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:37,810
Second trial, ten years later,
suddenly she changes her story.

1297
01:46:37,950 --> 01:46:41,230
She drew a picture,
like a bow tie.

1298
01:46:41,370 --> 01:46:45,490
Yeah. Yeah, I've got it here.

1299
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:50,030
"Taillights lit up all across the back like a butterfly, as the killer's car drove away."

1300
01:46:50,170 --> 01:46:52,130
"Like a butterfly."

1301
01:46:52,250 --> 01:46:55,090
So the first thing we have to do is find out exactly what Rubin's car looked like.

1302
01:46:55,210 --> 01:46:58,500
- We need to find a '66 Dodge Polara.
- Mm-hmm.

1303
01:46:58,630 --> 01:47:01,210
There's the bow-tie lights,
like Patty Valentine described.

1304
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:04,010
- I'm not so sure about
that. - You ready? - Yeah!

1305
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:07,010
Yeah.

1306
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:15,510
See that?
They don't light up all the way.

1307
01:47:15,650 --> 01:47:18,520
Oh, no, that's a Dodge Monaco.
You don't want one of those.

1308
01:47:18,650 --> 01:47:22,700
They don't have the power. Look,
I'll make you a good deal on this one.

1309
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:25,400
- Shit.
- Monaco?

1310
01:48:06,910 --> 01:48:10,820
- Mr Carter?
- Yeah.

1311
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:13,570
I was told to get you.

1312
01:48:13,710 --> 01:48:16,990
Get me? By whom?

1313
01:48:17,130 --> 01:48:19,340
The warden wants to see you.

1314
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:26,720
- For what?
- I don't know.

1315
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:43,190
Open up, Al.

1316
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:05,380
Mr Carter.

1317
01:49:10,180 --> 01:49:14,640
I have a difficult job
running this place...

1318
01:49:14,770 --> 01:49:16,340
but I do it.

1319
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:19,760
I do it really well.

1320
01:49:21,230 --> 01:49:24,930
You called me down here
at 3:00 in the morning to tell me that?

1321
01:49:25,070 --> 01:49:28,740
I hear things.
I hear everything.

1322
01:49:30,820 --> 01:49:33,230
What have you heard, Warden?

1323
01:49:33,370 --> 01:49:36,710
I hear something's goin' down.

1324
01:49:36,830 --> 01:49:41,960
I don't want a mess,
something that I can't clean up.

1325
01:49:42,090 --> 01:49:45,040
This doesn't have anything
to do with my case, does it?

1326
01:49:45,170 --> 01:49:48,090
Shit happens every day...

1327
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:52,000
and I wanna warn you, that's all.

1328
01:49:52,140 --> 01:49:56,880
Somebody tries to take you down,
something gets started...

1329
01:49:57,020 --> 01:49:59,060
I can't stop it.

1330
01:49:59,190 --> 01:50:03,680
- You understand me?
- What do you suggest I do?

1331
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:06,820
Stay alive.

1332
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:10,810
And that goes for your friends too.

1333
01:50:10,950 --> 01:50:13,900
Guard.

1334
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:45,070
- Who is it?
- We're looking for an Avery Cockersham.

1335
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:52,240
Do the Cockershams live here?

1336
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:55,700
I'm Mrs Cockersham.
What do you want?

1337
01:50:55,830 --> 01:50:57,790
You're black.

1338
01:50:59,450 --> 01:51:02,070
You're white.

1339
01:51:02,210 --> 01:51:06,250
Baked fresh this morning.
Now, you take the white one.

1340
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:12,330
Yeah, there were plenty coloured folks
in the neighbourhood...

1341
01:51:12,470 --> 01:51:15,800
and in the bar too.

1342
01:51:15,930 --> 01:51:19,270
- Avery and me were regulars.
- They served blacks in the bar?

1343
01:51:19,390 --> 01:51:21,350
We had a running tab.

1344
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:25,060
So much for the racial motive, eh?

1345
01:51:25,190 --> 01:51:28,720
My Avery got a good look
at those men...

1346
01:51:28,860 --> 01:51:31,100
and it wasn't Rubin Carter.

1347
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:34,520
He told the police.
He told 'em and he told 'em.

1348
01:51:34,660 --> 01:51:37,360
He even signed a statement
for that detective.

1349
01:51:37,490 --> 01:51:40,610
You know the one. Heavy set.

1350
01:51:40,750 --> 01:51:43,780
He looked like
a bulldog with glasses.

1351
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:47,000
- Della Pesca.
- That's the one.

1352
01:51:47,130 --> 01:51:51,370
Could we, uh,
talk with your husband?

1353
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:56,090
Avery's dead.

1354
01:51:57,680 --> 01:52:00,770
He died just before the trial.

1355
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:06,970
I'm sorry.

1356
01:52:29,790 --> 01:52:33,080
Here's stuff I wanna check out.

1357
01:52:33,210 --> 01:52:35,710
What is this?

1358
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,790
Who the fuck you think you are?

1359
01:52:40,930 --> 01:52:45,090
- Does this look like Toronto to you?
- Excuse me?

1360
01:52:45,230 --> 01:52:47,380
You know, you people, you got
some nerve comin' down here...

1361
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:51,730
pokin' your nose
where it don't belong.

1362
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:56,400
Let me ask you something,
Mr Canada.

1363
01:52:56,530 --> 01:52:59,310
What the fuck do you know
about this place, huh? Huh?

1364
01:52:59,450 --> 01:53:02,480
You know anything?
You don't know shit.

1365
01:53:02,620 --> 01:53:04,910
Let me enlighten you...

1366
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:09,500
because you don't know
what you're doin'.

1367
01:53:09,630 --> 01:53:14,790
You are making enemies
that you don't know exist.

1368
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:18,920
- Huh?
- We know about you.

1369
01:53:19,050 --> 01:53:22,220
You don't know shit about me.
You understand?

1370
01:53:22,350 --> 01:53:25,350
You don't know shit about this place,
and let me tell ya something else.

1371
01:53:25,470 --> 01:53:27,550
You're not welcome here, okay?

1372
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:30,390
You're not fuckin' welcome here.

1373
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:34,270
You got that?
Go back to where you belong.

1374
01:53:58,970 --> 01:54:01,640
Lesra's gonna have to get on
with school, so...

1375
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:05,210
we might want to send him back
for a while.

1376
01:54:05,350 --> 01:54:08,210
- I understand. It's probably the best.
- Yeah.

1377
01:54:08,350 --> 01:54:11,630
- Yeah.
- What about you?

1378
01:54:11,770 --> 01:54:16,600
Oh, it's- it's gonna take
a little longer than we thought.

1379
01:54:20,030 --> 01:54:22,270
Y'all all right?

1380
01:54:24,410 --> 01:54:27,530
Yeah.

1381
01:54:37,420 --> 01:54:39,550
I have asked myself, Lisa...

1382
01:54:39,670 --> 01:54:43,750
if I could do for anyone...

1383
01:54:43,890 --> 01:54:48,100
what you and Sam and Terry and Lesra
have done for me, and the answer is no.

1384
01:54:48,220 --> 01:54:50,600
- So if you feel like you need
to go home... - Shh. We're not-

1385
01:54:50,730 --> 01:54:54,940
for any reason,
I'll understand. You-

1386
01:54:55,060 --> 01:54:58,150
No, you gotta understand.
We're not-

1387
01:54:58,270 --> 01:55:01,390
We're not leaving without you.

1388
01:55:03,610 --> 01:55:06,370
All right?

1389
01:55:06,490 --> 01:55:09,280
And we're gonna find something.

1390
01:55:15,370 --> 01:55:17,030
Um, well, I found something-

1391
01:55:18,590 --> 01:55:22,040
a fellow by the name of Barbieri.

1392
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:28,000
He's a private investigator. Prosecution
hired him in the second trial.

1393
01:55:28,140 --> 01:55:30,710
- Didn't he resign from the case or something?
- He quit...

1394
01:55:30,850 --> 01:55:34,190
and he turned in his murder book
and crime-scene photos...

1395
01:55:34,310 --> 01:55:37,590
list of evidence, but no notes.

1396
01:55:37,730 --> 01:55:40,510
- Anyone talk to him?
- Myron tracked him down.

1397
01:55:40,650 --> 01:55:43,060
- What'd he say?
- Nothin'. He was scared.

1398
01:55:43,190 --> 01:55:46,730
- Of whom?
- Of the people he was workin' with.

1399
01:55:57,040 --> 01:55:59,500
- Mrs Barbieri?
- Miss.

1400
01:55:59,630 --> 01:56:03,870
- Hello. Uh, is Mr Barbieri in?
- There isn't any mister.

1401
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:09,170
Uh, Dominick, Dominick Barbieri?

1402
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:13,380
That was my father.
He passed away years ago.

1403
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:28,850
Wow. Maybe you oughta have
a yard sale.

1404
01:56:28,990 --> 01:56:31,480
That case always bothered
my father.

1405
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:35,860
He never talked about it. He said
he had to live in this town, you know?

1406
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,570
Yeah. Do you have any idea
where his notes might be?

1407
01:56:38,710 --> 01:56:42,130
Well, if he kept them at all,
they'd be in one of those boxes.

1408
01:56:45,670 --> 01:56:49,720
Guy was a pack rat. He must have saved
every case he ever worked on.

1409
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:55,470
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What?

1410
01:56:57,430 --> 01:57:00,140
- I found it. Look at this. Look.
- What?

1411
01:57:00,270 --> 01:57:03,020
- He kept a damn diary.
- Oh, look.

1412
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:06,820
Who would have thought he'd put it
in a diary? But he did. Look at this.

1413
01:57:06,940 --> 01:57:08,990
There.

1414
01:57:09,110 --> 01:57:12,230
A call was placed to
an emergency operator named Jean Wahl...

1415
01:57:12,370 --> 01:57:15,480
at 2:28 a. M. To report the shooting.

1416
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:18,190
- At 2:28?
- That's right.

1417
01:57:18,330 --> 01:57:21,280
She then calls the cops
to tell them.

1418
01:57:21,420 --> 01:57:23,880
They say they already know about it.
In fact...

1419
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,250
they've got a cruiser on its way
over to the Lafayette at that moment.

1420
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:30,540
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.

1421
01:57:33,090 --> 01:57:35,670
According to Barbieri...

1422
01:57:35,810 --> 01:57:39,510
"time on the record
of customer contact was changed...

1423
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:42,650
from 2:28 to 2:45."

1424
01:57:42,770 --> 01:57:45,810
- Yes.
- Son of a bitch.

1425
01:57:45,940 --> 01:57:48,520
Which, if true,
puts John Artis and myself...

1426
01:57:48,650 --> 01:57:52,350
at the Nite Spot
at the time of the killings.

1427
01:57:52,490 --> 01:57:55,410
Well, if we can prove
she got the call at 2:28.

1428
01:57:55,530 --> 01:57:57,780
We'll prove it.

1429
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:02,860
We can prove it.

1430
01:58:14,840 --> 01:58:17,090
Mrs Wahl?

1431
01:58:17,220 --> 01:58:22,100
Hi. My name is Sam Chaiton. We spoke on the phone about the Rubin Carter case.

1432
01:58:22,230 --> 01:58:24,930
- I told you, I don't want to talk to you.
- Mrs Wahl, please.

1433
01:58:25,060 --> 01:58:27,270
Um, you told an investigator
named Barbieri...

1434
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:32,200
that an emergency call you took the night of the Lafayette bar murders was at 2:28.

1435
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:35,190
I don't know what I told him.
It was a long time ago.

1436
01:58:35,320 --> 01:58:39,320
Uh, but there's a card
that says 2:45 on it...

1437
01:58:39,450 --> 01:58:42,460
and, uh, you didn't sign the card.

1438
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:46,280
According to Barbieri, it was signed
by a Miss Lenore Harkinson.

1439
01:58:46,420 --> 01:58:50,090
- She was my supervisor.
- Why would your supervisor sign the card?

1440
01:58:50,210 --> 01:58:52,450
And wouldn't you normally
do that yourself?

1441
01:58:52,590 --> 01:58:56,580
Look, if there's a card and that's
what it says, then that's what it says.

1442
01:58:56,720 --> 01:59:01,380
I don't remember anything else. And if someone tries to make me testify, that's just what I'll say.

1443
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:04,800
Uh, look, Mrs Wahl-

1444
01:59:04,940 --> 01:59:07,090
Thank you.

1445
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:13,310
So this is a copy of the phone
company's record of customer contact.

1446
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:16,900
It's all there,
just like Barbieri said.

1447
01:59:17,030 --> 01:59:19,330
2:45.

1448
01:59:21,410 --> 01:59:23,370
Look at the signature on the card.

1449
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:27,630
It's signed by Lenora Harkinson,
Jean Wahl's supervisor.

1450
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:31,030
Does that mean anything to you?

1451
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:35,790
It means she didn't have
to write up a phoney ticket.

1452
01:59:35,930 --> 01:59:38,590
What?

1453
01:59:38,720 --> 01:59:41,210
He signed it himself.

1454
01:59:41,350 --> 01:59:44,460
Who?

1455
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:48,980
His handwriting is
on every report that...

1456
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:52,810
put me in prison
since I was 11 years old.

1457
01:59:55,530 --> 01:59:57,820
It's Della Pesca.

1458
02:00:00,990 --> 02:00:03,450
It's his handwriting.

1459
02:00:16,470 --> 02:00:18,960
- Oh, shit! What's happening?
- What the hell is that?

1460
02:00:19,090 --> 02:00:22,100
- Don't know.
- What is that?

1461
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:28,880
- Oh, shit!
- Hold on!

1462
02:00:34,780 --> 02:00:38,200
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1463
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:40,940
- Les, you okay? - I'm
all right. - Are ya?

1464
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:46,400
- Are you all right? Yeah?
- I think so. Damn.

1465
02:00:48,210 --> 02:00:50,530
- Yeah? - Shit.
- Hey, you okay?

1466
02:00:50,670 --> 02:00:53,280
- What the fuck was that?
- Need help?

1467
02:00:53,420 --> 02:00:55,550
We're okay. Thanks.

1468
02:00:55,670 --> 02:00:57,750
- Are they all right?
- Goddam.

1469
02:00:57,880 --> 02:01:00,880
The car just went right over
the centre divider-

1470
02:01:14,270 --> 02:01:17,810
Rubin, the law states we have to take our new evidence back to the original trial judge...

1471
02:01:17,940 --> 02:01:22,190
- and then if he turns us down, we go to the
state appeals court- - No. No, no, no, no!

1472
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:27,200
Listen to me. These people
aren't gonna just let that happen.

1473
02:01:27,330 --> 02:01:29,490
They've made their careers
on my case.

1474
02:01:29,620 --> 02:01:32,870
- What are you talking about, Rubin?
- I'm talking about lawyers, prosecutors, judges...

1475
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,590
who have moved up the ladder
on my black back.

1476
02:01:38,550 --> 02:01:40,920
We don't even know what enemies
we have out there in this state.

1477
02:01:41,050 --> 02:01:44,750
We gotta take it out of New Jersey, and
we gotta take it to the federal court.

1478
02:01:44,890 --> 02:01:47,460
Rubin, if you go
into federal court...

1479
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:50,380
with new evidence that hasn't been
heard in the state court...

1480
02:01:50,520 --> 02:01:53,090
the judge is gonna throw
it out, okay?

1481
02:01:53,230 --> 02:01:55,640
- That is the law.
- Then we transcend the law.

1482
02:01:55,770 --> 02:01:58,890
We, we, we get back to humanity.

1483
02:01:59,030 --> 02:02:01,600
You said it yourself.
You said if we take the new evidence...

1484
02:02:01,740 --> 02:02:05,350
before the federal judge, he's gotta look at it before he throws it out, right?

1485
02:02:05,490 --> 02:02:09,190
- Right.
- I believe that once he looks at it, he will have seen the truth.

1486
02:02:09,330 --> 02:02:13,570
Having seen the truth,
he can't turn his back on me.

1487
02:02:13,710 --> 02:02:17,160
And what if you're wrong
and he does turn away? Then what?

1488
02:02:17,290 --> 02:02:20,630
Then you throw out all this evidence
that everyone's fought so hard to get.

1489
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:25,050
And you know what, Rubin? You will never be able to mention it in a court of law again.

1490
02:02:25,180 --> 02:02:29,640
It is finished. It's erased.
It's as if it never happened.

1491
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:34,060
This evidence is the key to getting you out of here, and you'll be throwing it away, Rubin...

1492
02:02:34,190 --> 02:02:37,550
- when in a few more years-
- I don't have a few more years, Myron!

1493
02:02:39,230 --> 02:02:41,850
- Leon, help me out.
- I can't.

1494
02:02:41,980 --> 02:02:44,360
I agree with Rubin.
It's time to move on.

1495
02:02:44,490 --> 02:02:47,270
- Move on? What do you mean, move on? Move on where?
- The state's biased, Myron.

1496
02:02:47,410 --> 02:02:49,450
We're never gonna get anything there.
We have to go federal.

1497
02:02:49,580 --> 02:02:54,570
- We can't take the risk of going federal with this.
- Listen to me. Listen to me!

1498
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,380
I'm 50 years old.

1499
02:03:06,130 --> 02:03:10,130
I've been locked up
here for 30 years.

1500
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:17,930
I've put a lot of
good people's lives at risk.

1501
02:03:18,060 --> 02:03:21,060
Now, either I get outta here-

1502
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:28,810
Get me outta here.

1503
02:03:53,180 --> 02:03:55,340
Ready?

1504
02:03:57,850 --> 02:04:00,150
Good luck, Rubin.

1505
02:04:07,740 --> 02:04:11,240
This is for you.
You stay strong.

1506
02:04:18,080 --> 02:04:22,740
- Good luck.
- My man. Peace, baby. Be cool now.

1507
02:04:22,880 --> 02:04:25,030
Good luck, Mr Carter.

1508
02:04:48,030 --> 02:04:51,450
- Rubin.
- Rubin Carter, prisoner 45472.

1509
02:04:52,910 --> 02:04:55,610
- See you around.
- Okay, Jimmy.

1510
02:05:03,830 --> 02:05:06,450
Your Honour, we appear before you...

1511
02:05:06,590 --> 02:05:11,250
in our 19th year before the courts.

1512
02:05:11,380 --> 02:05:15,140
Rubin Carter has never enjoyed
a full, fair...

1513
02:05:15,260 --> 02:05:17,800
and unforced disclosure
of the facts...

1514
02:05:17,930 --> 02:05:20,970
to which he is
constitutionally entitled.

1515
02:05:23,230 --> 02:05:27,140
For 19 years,
the truth has been hidden...

1516
02:05:28,690 --> 02:05:31,270
not only from Rubin Carter's eyes...

1517
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:34,820
- but from the eyes of justice
itself and- - Uh, Your Honour.

1518
02:05:34,950 --> 02:05:37,020
The prosecution
objects forcefully here.

1519
02:05:37,160 --> 02:05:39,650
Counsel is attempting
to present new evidence...

1520
02:05:39,790 --> 02:05:42,400
and circumvent
the State Court of New Jersey.

1521
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:45,000
Your Honour must,
according to the law...

1522
02:05:45,120 --> 02:05:48,380
drop this entire petition
where it belongs- into the garbage.

1523
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:51,840
Your Honour, we implore you
to at least hear us...

1524
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:54,090
before making your ruling.

1525
02:05:54,220 --> 02:05:56,380
Mr Beldock, I hope you understand...

1526
02:05:56,510 --> 02:05:59,510
the implications of your action.

1527
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:03,970
That is a very slippery slope...

1528
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:07,860
you're trying to climb.

1529
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:11,680
- We do, Your Honour.
- Proceed.

1530
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:19,860
In 1976, the State of New Jersey's...

1531
02:06:19,990 --> 02:06:23,000
chief investigator of this case,
Dominick Barbieri...

1532
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:26,570
resigned because he
discovered the truth.

1533
02:06:26,710 --> 02:06:28,780
He discovered
that this case was built...

1534
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:33,130
on a foundation
of forgeries and lies.

1535
02:06:33,260 --> 02:06:36,340
Those lies show the guilt
not of Rubin Carter...

1536
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:40,710
but of a corrupt police force
and the prosecutor's office.

1537
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:49,650
And now this wall of lies
has been destroyed...

1538
02:06:49,770 --> 02:06:52,770
so that this court
may finally see the truth...

1539
02:06:52,900 --> 02:06:56,070
and, pray God,
not turn its eyes away.

1540
02:06:56,190 --> 02:07:00,610
This court is
not unmoved by your...

1541
02:07:00,740 --> 02:07:03,410
eloquence and passion...

1542
02:07:03,540 --> 02:07:06,460
but the prosecution is correct.

1543
02:07:06,580 --> 02:07:09,250
This petition
contains new evidence...

1544
02:07:09,370 --> 02:07:14,580
that has not been presented
before the State Court of New Jersey...

1545
02:07:14,710 --> 02:07:18,470
and there is no legal argument
that you could make...

1546
02:07:18,590 --> 02:07:21,460
which would allow me to consider it.

1547
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:25,300
Therefore, you have
two choices before you:

1548
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:28,630
I can send this case
back to the state court...

1549
02:07:28,770 --> 02:07:31,470
and you can present the evidence...

1550
02:07:31,610 --> 02:07:34,890
or, if you insist...

1551
02:07:35,030 --> 02:07:38,640
on, uh, proceeding...

1552
02:07:38,780 --> 02:07:42,530
this evidence will be lost
to you forever.

1553
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:51,040
You understand the choice
before you, Mr Beldock?

1554
02:07:58,010 --> 02:08:02,890
Your Honour, may I request
a moment to confer with my client?

1555
02:08:03,010 --> 02:08:07,060
That's the smartest thing
you've said all morning, Counsellor.

1556
02:08:14,310 --> 02:08:18,180
Rubin, listen to me. This judge is telling us as clearly as he possibly can...

1557
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:20,890
that he's going
to rule against you.

1558
02:08:21,030 --> 02:08:23,810
- This is our last stand, Myron.
- Rubin, I am begging you-

1559
02:08:23,950 --> 02:08:26,190
Let's proceed.

1560
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:42,750
Your Honour, my client wishes
to continue with this proceeding.

1561
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:45,010
Uh, do you do so formally...

1562
02:08:45,140 --> 02:08:48,890
and, uh, are you aware of the, uh...

1563
02:08:49,020 --> 02:08:52,440
significance of such an action?

1564
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:55,900
We do so formally.

1565
02:09:01,150 --> 02:09:04,520
- Proceed.
- But, Your Honour-

1566
02:09:04,660 --> 02:09:06,810
- Yes?
- Uh, the state is not prepared...

1567
02:09:06,950 --> 02:09:09,330
to proceed to argue
the merits of this case.

1568
02:09:09,450 --> 02:09:11,360
Why not?

1569
02:09:13,290 --> 02:09:15,250
Well, we, we assumed...

1570
02:09:15,370 --> 02:09:19,040
that the court would not hear
this petition based on new evidence.

1571
02:09:21,130 --> 02:09:23,090
You assumed wrong.

1572
02:09:26,970 --> 02:09:29,130
Proceed.

1573
02:09:30,890 --> 02:09:34,420
So, Your Honour, this case
was poisoned from the start.

1574
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:36,520
No evidence.

1575
02:09:36,650 --> 02:09:40,480
No witnesses,
except admitted liars.

1576
02:09:40,610 --> 02:09:43,530
Only a racially charged atmosphere...

1577
02:09:43,650 --> 02:09:47,240
which was fanned by the police
and the prosecutors...

1578
02:09:47,360 --> 02:09:51,120
who knew the truth
and distorted it...

1579
02:09:51,240 --> 02:09:55,150
and subverted it and destroyed it...

1580
02:09:55,290 --> 02:09:57,580
to convict an innocent man.

1581
02:10:00,170 --> 02:10:02,550
What more can the State
of New Jersey do, Your Honour...

1582
02:10:02,670 --> 02:10:05,210
than give a man not one...

1583
02:10:05,340 --> 02:10:07,750
but two jury trials?

1584
02:10:07,890 --> 02:10:10,640
And nothing has changed since then.

1585
02:10:10,760 --> 02:10:15,230
Mr Carter is, and always has been,
a menace to society.

1586
02:10:15,350 --> 02:10:17,640
He's been in and out of jail
his whole life.

1587
02:10:17,770 --> 02:10:20,470
A criminal.
He's a violent man.

1588
02:10:20,610 --> 02:10:23,010
His whole life has been violence.

1589
02:10:23,150 --> 02:10:26,430
And it is our duty, Your Honour,
to continue to protect...

1590
02:10:26,570 --> 02:10:29,770
the general public
from such a man.

1591
02:10:29,910 --> 02:10:32,280
Thank you.

1592
02:10:39,330 --> 02:10:44,840
I've heard your statements.
Uh, I'll take them under consideration.

1593
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:48,920
Now, is there anything else
that counsel wishes to add...

1594
02:10:49,050 --> 02:10:52,640
before I make my final ruling?

1595
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:54,920
- What are you doing? - I want to say
something. - What are you gonna say?

1596
02:10:55,060 --> 02:10:57,920
I want to-
I need to say something.

1597
02:10:58,060 --> 02:11:00,840
Uh, Your Honour, m-my-
my client, Mr Carter...

1598
02:11:00,980 --> 02:11:03,270
wishes to address the court.

1599
02:11:05,190 --> 02:11:07,650
Request granted.

1600
02:11:07,780 --> 02:11:09,940
Thank you, Your Honour.

1601
02:11:12,450 --> 02:11:15,320
I was a, um...

1602
02:11:15,450 --> 02:11:17,750
prizefighter.

1603
02:11:19,410 --> 02:11:22,030
My job was to...

1604
02:11:22,170 --> 02:11:24,240
take all the hatred...

1605
02:11:24,380 --> 02:11:27,080
and skill that I could muster...

1606
02:11:27,210 --> 02:11:31,960
and send a man to his destruction,
and I did that.

1607
02:11:34,140 --> 02:11:37,470
But Rubin "Hurricane" Carter
is no murderer.

1608
02:11:40,140 --> 02:11:43,430
Twenty years I've spent
locked up in a cage...

1609
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:45,810
considered a danger to society.

1610
02:11:47,690 --> 02:11:50,070
Not treated like a human being.

1611
02:11:50,190 --> 02:11:52,900
Not treated like a person.

1612
02:11:53,030 --> 02:11:55,950
Counted 15 times a day.

1613
02:11:58,290 --> 02:12:00,750
I serve my time
in a house of justice...

1614
02:12:00,870 --> 02:12:03,280
and yet, there's
no justice for me.

1615
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:10,580
So, I ask you
to consider the evidence.

1616
02:12:10,720 --> 02:12:15,850
Don't turn away from the truth.
Don't turn away from your conscience.

1617
02:12:15,970 --> 02:12:19,670
Please, don't ignore the law.
No, em-embrace that...

1618
02:12:19,810 --> 02:12:23,970
higher principle for which
the law was meant to serve.

1619
02:12:28,270 --> 02:12:31,060
Justice. That's all
I ask for, Your Honour.

1620
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:36,030
Justice.

1621
02:12:39,990 --> 02:12:42,690
This court is in recess.

1622
02:12:57,140 --> 02:12:59,510
Oh, thank you.

1623
02:13:11,820 --> 02:13:13,980
It's good.

1624
02:13:20,950 --> 02:13:24,400
Come a long way,
huh, little brother?

1625
02:13:26,670 --> 02:13:29,240
Yeah.

1626
02:13:29,380 --> 02:13:31,750
Look, Rubin, I just want you to know
if this doesn't work...

1627
02:13:31,880 --> 02:13:34,800
I'm bustin' you outta here.

1628
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:37,080
- You are?
- Yeah. That's right.

1629
02:13:37,220 --> 02:13:39,380
I'm bustin' you outta here.

1630
02:13:42,220 --> 02:13:45,060
What was the first book
you ever bought?

1631
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:48,800
Yours.

1632
02:13:50,190 --> 02:13:53,720
You think that was an accident?

1633
02:13:53,860 --> 02:13:56,950
- No.
- No, me neither.

1634
02:13:57,070 --> 02:14:00,910
Lesra, short for Lazarus.

1635
02:14:01,030 --> 02:14:04,450
"He who has risen from the dead."

1636
02:14:05,950 --> 02:14:08,420
Rubin.

1637
02:14:08,540 --> 02:14:11,660
Genesis, chapter 29, verse 32.

1638
02:14:11,790 --> 02:14:14,410
"Behold a son."

1639
02:14:16,840 --> 02:14:19,080
You put those two together, Lesra,
and you have...

1640
02:14:19,220 --> 02:14:22,500
"Behold a son who is risen...

1641
02:14:22,640 --> 02:14:24,880
from the dead."

1642
02:14:27,730 --> 02:14:29,970
That's no accident.

1643
02:14:34,110 --> 02:14:37,030
Hate put me in prison.

1644
02:14:39,150 --> 02:14:42,270
Love's gonna bust me out.

1645
02:14:46,330 --> 02:14:50,990
Just in case love doesn't,
I'm gonna bust you outta here.

1646
02:15:02,050 --> 02:15:04,210
Yeah.

1647
02:15:04,350 --> 02:15:07,850
You already have, Lesra.

1648
02:15:08,060 --> 02:15:10,130
All rise.

1649
02:15:13,270 --> 02:15:16,640
This Federal District Court
of New Jersey is now in session.

1650
02:15:16,770 --> 02:15:19,020
Judge Sarokin presiding.

1651
02:15:22,820 --> 02:15:25,520
Be seated.

1652
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:48,760
This court does not arrive
at its conclusion lightly.

1653
02:15:48,890 --> 02:15:52,260
On one hand, Rubin Carter
has submitted a document...

1654
02:15:52,390 --> 02:15:55,180
alleging racial prejudice...

1655
02:15:55,310 --> 02:15:58,730
coercion of testimony
and withholding of evidence.

1656
02:15:58,860 --> 02:16:00,990
On the other hand...

1657
02:16:01,110 --> 02:16:04,230
Mr Carter was tried twice...

1658
02:16:04,360 --> 02:16:06,610
by two different juries...

1659
02:16:06,740 --> 02:16:09,320
and those convictions
were subsequently upheld...

1660
02:16:09,450 --> 02:16:13,290
by the New Jersey
State Supreme Court.

1661
02:16:13,410 --> 02:16:17,630
He's gonna rule against us.
Rubin's gonna lose.

1662
02:16:17,750 --> 02:16:20,080
However, the extensive record...

1663
02:16:20,210 --> 02:16:22,700
clearly demonstrates
to this court...

1664
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:25,170
that Rubin Carter's conviction...

1665
02:16:25,300 --> 02:16:28,550
was predicated upon an appeal...

1666
02:16:28,680 --> 02:16:30,970
to racism...

1667
02:16:31,100 --> 02:16:33,260
rather than reason...

1668
02:16:33,390 --> 02:16:35,630
and concealment...

1669
02:16:35,770 --> 02:16:38,970
rather than disclosure.

1670
02:16:39,110 --> 02:16:41,680
To permit convictions to stand...

1671
02:16:41,820 --> 02:16:44,190
which have
as their sole foundation...

1672
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:48,100
appeals to racial prejudice...

1673
02:16:48,240 --> 02:16:50,620
is to commit...

1674
02:16:50,740 --> 02:16:52,980
a violation...

1675
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:55,160
of the Constitution...

1676
02:16:55,290 --> 02:16:59,330
as heinous as the crimes
for which the defendants...

1677
02:16:59,460 --> 02:17:01,530
were tried...

1678
02:17:01,670 --> 02:17:03,660
and convicted.

1679
02:17:03,800 --> 02:17:06,260
I hereby order Rubin Carter...

1680
02:17:06,380 --> 02:17:09,080
- released from prison...
- Yes!

1681
02:17:09,220 --> 02:17:12,220
Henceforth, from this day forward.

1682
02:17:12,350 --> 02:17:15,220
Yes! Yes.

1683
02:17:16,810 --> 02:17:19,650
This court is adjourned.

1684
02:17:19,770 --> 02:17:23,850
Hey, Rube, you made- you made it, man!
You're free! Can you stand it?

1685
02:17:27,650 --> 02:17:30,190
You did it, Rube.
You did it, man.

1686
02:17:32,030 --> 02:17:34,950
- Yeah, huh?
- Yeah!

1687
02:17:54,100 --> 02:17:57,100
<i>Rubin Carter has just been freed.</i>

1688
02:18:10,780 --> 02:18:13,360
All right!
You're free, Rubin!

1689
02:18:39,890 --> 02:18:42,560
Mr Carter.
Hey, Mr Carter.

1690
02:18:42,690 --> 02:18:44,850
Mr Carter.

1691
02:19:00,620 --> 02:19:03,710
Mr Carter? Mr Carter?

1692
02:19:06,670 --> 02:19:10,830
Mr Carter? Now that you're out,
a- are you still gonna be The Hurricane?

1693
02:19:13,430 --> 02:19:16,960
Oh, I'll always be The Hurricane.

1694
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:20,710
And The Hurricane is beautiful.

1695
02:19:23,480 --> 02:19:26,350
This is unbelievable!

1696
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:28,720
The crowd is going wild.

1697
02:19:28,860 --> 02:19:33,270
Everybody wanted this victory,
and Hurricane has delivered.

1698
02:19:37,070 --> 02:19:40,610
<i>Yes, that's the story
of T he Hurricane</i>

1699
02:19:40,740 --> 02:19:43,910
<i>But it won't be over
till they clear his name</i>

1700
02:19:44,040 --> 02:19:47,630
<i>And give him back
the time he's done</i>

1701
02:19:47,750 --> 02:19:50,500
<i>Put in a prison cell
but one time</i>

1702
02:19:50,630 --> 02:19:55,290
<i>He could have been
the champion of the world</i>

1703
02:21:03,990 --> 02:21:07,530
<i>When your life's a wall</i>

1704
02:21:07,660 --> 02:21:11,370
<i>Can't see the light of day</i>

1705
02:21:11,500 --> 02:21:15,170
<i>When your hope is gone</i>

1706
02:21:15,300 --> 02:21:19,170
<i>When you second-guess your faith</i>

1707
02:21:19,300 --> 02:21:22,390
<i>When you turn around</i>

1708
02:21:22,510 --> 02:21:26,640
<i>And realize that no one else</i>

1709
02:21:26,770 --> 02:21:29,230
<i>Will believe in you</i>

1710
02:21:29,350 --> 02:21:33,820
<i>Only yourself</i>

1711
02:21:33,940 --> 02:21:37,610
<i>When you're holding on</i>

1712
02:21:37,740 --> 02:21:41,490
<i>You can't find the will to breathe</i>

1713
02:21:41,610 --> 02:21:45,120
<i>Can you right the wrong</i>

1714
02:21:45,240 --> 02:21:48,910
<i>That has brought you to your knees</i>

1715
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:52,490
<i>Though you barely lived your life</i>

1716
02:21:52,630 --> 02:21:56,540
<i>You keep on believing you'll survive</i>

1717
02:21:56,670 --> 02:22:04,300
<i>And all that's left is what's inside</i>

1718
02:22:04,430 --> 02:22:11,760
<i>Amazing, I have heard my inner voice</i>

1719
02:22:11,890 --> 02:22:18,100
<i>That I need to rejoice</i>

1720
02:22:18,230 --> 02:22:21,770
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1721
02:22:21,900 --> 02:22:26,370
<i>- And way down
- Never thought that I would need</i>

1722
02:22:26,490 --> 02:22:32,580
<i>Amazing but now that I am free</i>

1723
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:34,220
<i>Amazing and now I'm</i>

1724
02:23:34,350 --> 02:23:41,570
<i>Free</i>

1725
02:23:41,690 --> 02:23:46,490
<i>Amazing, now</i>

1726
02:23:46,610 --> 02:23:51,980
<i>I am free</i>

1727
02:23:52,120 --> 02:23:54,900
<i>Yeah, yeah
A hurricane forever</i>

1728
02:23:55,040 --> 02:23:56,920
<i>Imagine you lie down forever</i>

1729
02:23:57,040 --> 02:23:59,710
<i>Could you stand forever
Could you hold it together</i>

1730
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:01,660
<i>I can't even explain the pain</i>

1731
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:04,500
<i>Imagine if your life
was like a hurricane</i>

1732
02:24:04,630 --> 02:24:06,540
<i>A hurricane forever
Imagine you lie down</i>

1733
02:24:06,680 --> 02:24:08,750
<i>Forever, ever, ever</i>

1734
02:24:08,890 --> 02:24:12,420
<i>Could you hold it together
Yo, I can't explain the pain with words</i>

1735
02:24:12,560 --> 02:24:15,310
<i>You know what I'm sayin, 'Just imagine
if your life was like a hurricane</i>

1736
02:24:15,430 --> 02:24:17,930
<i>The clouds cracked
and the heaven's gate was stormed</i>

1737
02:24:18,060 --> 02:24:20,550
<i>God placed it on man
on the day he was born</i>

1738
02:24:20,690 --> 02:24:23,260
<i>Convicted minutes after
a true natural disaster</i>

1739
02:24:23,400 --> 02:24:26,270
<i>Framed for manslaughter
The Hurricane Carter rising</i>

1740
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:28,940
<i>Come up from south water
like torrential rain</i>

1741
02:24:29,070 --> 02:24:31,310
<i>In the ring
no opponent escaped unscathed</i>

1742
02:24:31,450 --> 02:24:33,860
<i>You can't believe
The world we live in is unjust</i>

1743
02:24:33,990 --> 02:24:36,240
<i>All I see is more proof
There's no place for us</i>

1744
02:24:36,370 --> 02:24:39,040
<i>They had my man Carter
locked in a cage like an animal</i>

1745
02:24:39,170 --> 02:24:42,030
<i>Robbed him to a point
where the mind worked mechanical</i>

1746
02:24:42,170 --> 02:24:45,090
<i>Or worse by remote control
It was done to all of us</i>

1747
02:24:45,210 --> 02:24:47,010
<i>They tapped directly into our soul</i>

1748
02:24:47,130 --> 02:24:49,710
<i>Either up at Sing-Sing
or these bars around our mind</i>

1749
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:52,000
<i>There's nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide</i>

1750
02:24:52,140 --> 02:24:54,840
<i>And it's six-by-six
a guilty man cried</i>

1751
02:24:54,970 --> 02:24:57,430
<i>For penitence and losses
where innocence is</i>

1752
02:24:57,560 --> 02:25:00,590
<i>Hurricane
Could you lie down forever</i>

1753
02:25:00,730 --> 02:25:02,890
<i>Could you stand forever
Could you hold it together</i>

1754
02:25:03,020 --> 02:25:05,940
<i>I can't even explain the pain
hear what I'm sayin'</i>

1755
02:25:06,070 --> 02:25:10,900
<i>Your life was like a hurricane A hurricane forever Imagine behind bars forever</i>

1756
02:25:11,030 --> 02:25:13,810
<i>Could you stand it
Could you live for that</i>

1757
02:25:13,950 --> 02:25:16,870
<i>Tough for that
Chunk of that to know the pain</i>

1758
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:18,870
<i>Your life was like a hurricane</i>
