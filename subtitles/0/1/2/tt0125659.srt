1
00:00:32,844 --> 00:00:34,218
Open your eyes.

2
00:00:35,052 --> 00:00:36,394
Open your eyes.

3
00:00:37,228 --> 00:00:38,537
Open your eyes.

4
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,747
Open your eyes.

5
00:00:41,613 --> 00:00:42,955
Open your eyes.

6
00:00:43,787 --> 00:00:45,096
Open your eyes.

7
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:47,306
Open your eyes.

8
00:00:48,108 --> 00:00:49,417
Open your eyes.

9
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:11,788
Open your eyes.

10
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:21,261
Why tell me that dream?

11
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,715
You said I could tell you
whatever I wanted.

12
00:03:23,822 --> 00:03:26,538
All right. Anything else you
should tell me before we start?

13
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:30,467
Nothing you don't know.
I was about to turn 25.

14
00:03:30,574 --> 00:03:33,990
I liked eating, sleeping,
making love, like everyone.

15
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:36,133
And you know what everyone
does when they get up.

16
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,099
OPEN YOUR EYES

17
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:09,221
Where are you going?

18
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:10,668
Out.

19
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:14,406
Stop leaving messages on the alarm.

20
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,819
Why?

21
00:04:17,614 --> 00:04:18,858
Just don't.

22
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,638
Because it pisses me off.

23
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,623
Come on, for fuck's sake.

24
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:05,445
- I'll slaughter you.
- We'll see about that.

25
00:06:05,551 --> 00:06:08,681
You've got three cars.
Why do we always go in this wreck?

26
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:10,506
Come on. I'm in a hurry.

27
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:13,160
Are you backing out?
I missed class for this.

28
00:06:13,263 --> 00:06:16,646
I'm seeing my partners after.
Why do you think I'm dressed up?

29
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,402
So you can shout at them.
You like that.

30
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:21,291
I don't shout.

31
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:24,584
- So tell me, did you screw her?
- Screw who?

32
00:06:24,655 --> 00:06:26,759
Whoever was there
when I rang last night.

33
00:06:26,862 --> 00:06:30,244
I was alone last night.
Anyway, what is it to you?

34
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,968
Nothing. You can do what you want
with your life.

35
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:34,761
Thanks very much.

36
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,651
Let's change the subject.

37
00:06:38,255 --> 00:06:41,550
- Did you screw her?
- Give me a break. I was on my own.

38
00:06:41,616 --> 00:06:44,583
So, you did. Was it the one
you talk so much about?

39
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,509
- Who?
- That Nuria.

40
00:06:48,654 --> 00:06:50,891
My God, I can't believe it!

41
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:52,879
Csar seeing the same woman twice!

42
00:06:52,975 --> 00:06:55,626
- She must be great in bed.
- She isn't bad.

43
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:58,598
Bastard! When are you going
to tell me the secret?

44
00:06:58,703 --> 00:07:00,678
- What secret?
- The recipe for Coca-Cola.

45
00:07:00,783 --> 00:07:03,172
- Look, the kind you like.
- Yeah. Change the--

46
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:10,182
What did you eat today?

47
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:13,452
Nothing. That's my problem.
I'm starved!

48
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:17,452
It's funny when you ask them
what they value most in a man.

49
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:21,097
''I like him to be intelligent,
to be honest, to be kind.''

50
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:24,365
It's all shit! You'd have problems
if you were like me.

51
00:07:24,464 --> 00:07:26,634
Not that again!
You aren't ugly.

52
00:07:26,736 --> 00:07:29,224
Anybody would like to have
your face. You're normal.

53
00:07:29,296 --> 00:07:32,873
- Normal. That doesn't mean handsome.
- You're handsome.

54
00:07:32,975 --> 00:07:35,910
I'm acceptable,
when you're not beside me.

55
00:07:36,015 --> 00:07:39,846
You're like anorexics. They insist
they're fat, and end up crazy.

56
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:43,301
When some girl ties you down,
the rest of us will get a chance.

57
00:07:43,376 --> 00:07:45,131
- Yeah, yeah.
- Why not?

58
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,085
If you meet the right girl--

59
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:49,387
She doesn't exist.

60
00:07:49,456 --> 00:07:51,016
Shit!

61
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:54,795
- How did I miss that?
- God punished you.

62
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:56,935
You're for it.

63
00:07:57,007 --> 00:07:59,691
- Who are you saying that to?
- To God.

64
00:08:01,903 --> 00:08:04,554
Do you believe in God?

65
00:08:04,656 --> 00:08:08,332
- Don't start all that shit.
- I just asked a question.

66
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:11,017
If you don't want to,
don't answer.

67
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:14,660
I don't believe in God.

68
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:17,518
How do you explain
what happened?

69
00:08:17,616 --> 00:08:21,675
- How do you mean?
- Your face.

70
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:25,191
- There is no explanation.
- I believe there is.

71
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,712
- You believe I'm mad.
- I only believe what I see.

72
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:30,954
You haven't let me see
your face yet.

73
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:32,878
And I won't.

74
00:08:33,936 --> 00:08:36,424
Do you really think
you're a monster, Csar?

75
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:39,147
- Come on, let me see.
- Stick your hand up your ass!

76
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:42,893
Take it easy, brat!
I'm sick of all your stories.

77
00:08:42,992 --> 00:08:45,775
- Leave me alone!
- I'll kick the shit out of you!

78
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:47,247
Leave me alone!

79
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:50,126
I can't work with you in here.
Leave us on our own.

80
00:08:50,224 --> 00:08:52,874
On my responsibility.

81
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,543
You're just a spoiled brat who--

82
00:08:57,616 --> 00:08:59,918
My parents are dead, asshole!

83
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:02,798
You made up a story
so as not to admit what you did.

84
00:09:11,504 --> 00:09:13,292
Is that true?

85
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:16,678
What?

86
00:09:16,783 --> 00:09:18,572
That you're a spoiled brat.

87
00:09:20,304 --> 00:09:23,654
My father had a restaurant chain.
That's not my fault.

88
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:26,673
When did your parents die?

89
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:30,863
Fifteen years ago,
in an accident.

90
00:09:32,111 --> 00:09:34,981
- And now you're rich.
- So they say.

91
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:38,187
Then why don't you want
a lawyer?

92
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,447
They say they can get me
the best.

93
00:09:42,545 --> 00:09:45,447
- But they want me stuck here forever.
- Who are they?

94
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:49,261
My partners. They've been sucking
my blood since I was a kid.

95
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,932
Now they've got everything.
They've cut me out.

96
00:09:54,032 --> 00:09:55,920
It wasn't them.
It was me.

97
00:09:57,328 --> 00:09:59,849
I don't care.

98
00:10:01,297 --> 00:10:04,079
Let's see, Csar.
Do you know why you're here?

99
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:08,650
- Because I wear a mask, I guess.
- No.

100
00:10:08,752 --> 00:10:10,574
Because you killed someone.

101
00:10:11,536 --> 00:10:13,391
Or don't you remember?

102
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,612
- Tell me, don't you remember?
- Fuck! Stop it!

103
00:10:17,713 --> 00:10:20,015
We must get things clear
if you want us to get on.

104
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:21,672
I don't want us to get on!

105
00:10:21,777 --> 00:10:24,843
Is your solution to sit
in this hole and not talk?

106
00:10:24,945 --> 00:10:27,432
- Aren't we talking now?
- After two months.

107
00:10:31,472 --> 00:10:33,294
I've been trying
for two months.

108
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:35,531
- Read the reports.
- I've read them.

109
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:38,448
I want you to tell me,
if possible, sitting on a chair.

110
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:40,684
Or are you going to stay there?

111
00:10:40,784 --> 00:10:42,573
I like the floor.

112
00:10:43,634 --> 00:10:46,667
It's the only thing
that seems real.

113
00:10:46,737 --> 00:10:49,071
What does everything else seem?

114
00:10:49,137 --> 00:10:50,992
Everything else is a lie.

115
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:54,701
All this seems a lie,
including you.

116
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:56,973
You don't even wear a white coat.

117
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,943
- Do you think I should?
- Doctors wear them.

118
00:11:00,017 --> 00:11:01,959
I took it off so you'd forget
I was a doctor.

119
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:04,400
So that you'd like me more.

120
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,799
It didn't work.
I hate the sight of you.

121
00:11:11,826 --> 00:11:13,647
Now that we're friends--

122
00:11:13,745 --> 00:11:16,396
- I've got no friends.
- Tell me what happened.

123
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,943
The sooner you talk,
the sooner I'll go.

124
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,155
Hey! Happy birthday and all
the things people usually say.

125
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:44,080
Thank you, thank you.

126
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:48,110
- Where did you find her?
- In the library.

127
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:50,446
- She tried to steal my book.
- It was mine.

128
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:53,414
- Anyway, Csar, Sofia.
- Hello.

129
00:11:54,705 --> 00:11:56,013
Happy birthday.

130
00:11:56,145 --> 00:11:57,770
- Thank you.
- Your present.

131
00:11:57,873 --> 00:12:01,070
- Thanks a lot.
- We bought it between us.

132
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:04,334
Then I have to thank
both of you.

133
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,321
Stop chatting her up
and open it.

134
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,589
- I'd rather open them tomorrow.
- Whatever.

135
00:12:08,658 --> 00:12:10,118
- Like a drink?
- Sure.

136
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:12,298
I'll leave this upstairs.

137
00:12:30,737 --> 00:12:32,745
Hello.

138
00:12:37,938 --> 00:12:40,655
- What are you doing here?
- Happy birthday, darling.

139
00:12:40,754 --> 00:12:42,183
Thank you.

140
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:44,430
But I didn't ask you
to the party.

141
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:46,571
That was nice of you.

142
00:12:53,745 --> 00:12:56,615
I brought you a present, too.
Why not open it?

143
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,321
No, thanks. I already know
what's inside.

144
00:13:01,425 --> 00:13:03,248
- And last night?
- Listen, Nuria.

145
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:06,761
I don't like you just turning up,
much less coming into my room.

146
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:10,477
- Well! Do I have to apologize?
- No.

147
00:13:10,577 --> 00:13:13,065
You have to go.

148
00:13:13,138 --> 00:13:16,007
Right. I know what it is.

149
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:18,480
You don't want to be seen twice
with the same girl.

150
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:20,488
It would ruin your reputation.

151
00:13:22,578 --> 00:13:25,545
- You got it in one.
- And there's someone else.

152
00:13:25,618 --> 00:13:26,829
- Right?
- Who?

153
00:13:26,898 --> 00:13:29,965
The brunette you were talking to
a minute ago?

154
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:31,528
Well, she's not bad.

155
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:35,752
I don't care.

156
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,159
I don't need to be seen
with you.

157
00:13:43,955 --> 00:13:45,264
Hold me.

158
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,096
Come on.

159
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:53,898
A little kiss.

160
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,103
Come on.

161
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:12,401
Until when?
Until next Friday?

162
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:14,832
Can you manage a weekend
without me?

163
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:19,567
Excuse me. I must see
to my guests.

164
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:22,896
Yes, the brunette will take time.
She looks that type.

165
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:26,417
- That type?
- Yes.

166
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:29,068
The kind who can't find
your zipper.

167
00:14:33,137 --> 00:14:36,203
- Hello.
- Hello.

168
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:38,609
- What did you want?
- To open this.

169
00:14:38,707 --> 00:14:40,016
Wait.

170
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:41,903
I'll serve you.

171
00:14:44,627 --> 00:14:46,602
Since when are you the waiter?

172
00:14:46,707 --> 00:14:48,976
Don't you know I'm in catering?

173
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:53,096
Are you all right?

174
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,586
- Can't you tell I'm elbowing in?
- A bit.

175
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:58,546
I've got a slight problem.

176
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,552
- A girl's chasing me.
- You don't say.

177
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:04,401
- I need help to get rid of her.
- And I'm that help.

178
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:05,961
Shit! There she is!

179
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:09,645
- Where?
- Don't look. Look over here.

180
00:15:09,747 --> 00:15:12,168
That's it. Yes.

181
00:15:12,274 --> 00:15:14,642
Yes, yes, yes.

182
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:17,520
- Here we are.
- Here we are.

183
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:23,208
Well, act as if we were talking about
something real interesting.

184
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:26,994
Nod your head, agree,
say yes.

185
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,122
You know.

186
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:32,015
- What a nice conversation.
- Yes.

187
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:35,016
- And she's coming this way.
- Fuck!

188
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:39,213
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry, I'll guide you.

189
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:41,487
- Straight on.
- I don't see her.

190
00:15:41,588 --> 00:15:43,922
Here it is.
Go right in.

191
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,216
- I'm not going in there.
- Well, I am. So long.

192
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:59,122
- He's in here.
- You--

193
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:04,394
Well, we're safe.

194
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,186
But we've got nothing
to drink here.

195
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:10,002
I think all you really want
is to chat with me.

196
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,873
Yes, that too.
First, I want to save my skin.

197
00:16:13,938 --> 00:16:16,208
Can't you say
you aren't interested?

198
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:18,762
She wouldn't care.
She never gets tired.

199
00:16:18,868 --> 00:16:20,657
- She must be feeling bad.
- Yeah.

200
00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:22,064
Of course.

201
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:39,569
So you're studying drama,
like Pelayo?

202
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:42,188
- For now.
- Scenography?

203
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,129
- Acting.
- Really? To be an actress?

204
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:47,472
I am an actress.
Is that a problem?

205
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:50,418
Yes. Aren't you ashamed?

206
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:53,996
Ashamed?
Why should I be ashamed?

207
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,693
Actors aren't honest.

208
00:16:55,795 --> 00:16:58,829
You're able to show emotions
you don't have...

209
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,388
or which, at most,
you invent.

210
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,499
Right now you could be thinking...

211
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:05,960
''This guy is a real drag.
How can I dump him?''

212
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:09,996
- Really?
- ''And in catering. A pain in the ass.''

213
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,099
But you're a good actress.
It doesn't show.

214
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:32,141
- Hey, Pelayo!
- I caught you.

215
00:17:32,212 --> 00:17:34,732
- Come in.
- How's it going?

216
00:17:34,834 --> 00:17:36,875
Great. I'm a bit out of it now.

217
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,409
Drunk, you mean.

218
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,785
Why are you in here?

219
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:44,529
Sofia was protecting me
from a female psychopath out there.

220
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:47,628
- She seemed dangerous.
- Yeah.

221
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,957
- What about you?
- I was drinking. Women don't chase me.

222
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:54,441
- We're out of drink.
- Here.

223
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:56,436
- Shit.
- I'll get some more.

224
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,559
For all of us.

225
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:06,675
Well, I guess I'll be going.

226
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,418
- Why?
- I'm drunk and don't feel well.

227
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:12,687
Don't be stupid.
It's just starting.

228
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:16,749
- For you, it is.
- Pelayo, you can't go.

229
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,730
You're my guest of honor.

230
00:18:19,956 --> 00:18:21,811
You're a son of a bitch, Csar.

231
00:18:21,908 --> 00:18:24,462
- Why'd you say that?
- The party's full of girls.

232
00:18:24,533 --> 00:18:27,795
I go for a piss, you start
talking to her, and--

233
00:18:27,861 --> 00:18:29,617
What?

234
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,714
Nothing. And I look like
an asshole.

235
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,471
Tell me what's wrong.

236
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,875
- Why do you have to chat up Sofia?
- No one's chatting up Sofia.

237
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,802
Yeah, and I'm blind, right?

238
00:18:44,148 --> 00:18:46,090
You're certainly drunk.

239
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,330
I'm drunk,
but I'll tell you this.

240
00:18:53,428 --> 00:18:55,403
I like Sofia a hell of a lot.

241
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:58,705
She may even be
the girl of my dreams.

242
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:02,635
But if she fucks up our friendship,
she can go to hell.

243
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,945
I feel the same.

244
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:06,387
Sure.

245
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:17,073
Pelayo, where are you going?

246
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,996
- Home.
- Already?

247
00:19:19,061 --> 00:19:21,613
- Yeah, I'm wrecked.
- I'll come with you.

248
00:19:21,716 --> 00:19:24,106
Don't bother. You stay.

249
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:26,701
Are you going, too?

250
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:29,331
I have to get up early.

251
00:19:29,428 --> 00:19:31,851
I can run you home later.

252
00:19:33,142 --> 00:19:36,174
Stay on. I'm leaving you
in good hands.

253
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,428
What's wrong with him?

254
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:43,436
He's drunk.

255
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,930
- Is he annoyed with us?
- No.

256
00:19:46,037 --> 00:19:47,346
You sure?

257
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,396
She doesn't look too happy.

258
00:19:54,516 --> 00:19:56,459
Didn't you have to get up early?

259
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:00,947
I'm doing too much
for you tonight.

260
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:03,987
- Maybe it means something.
- Yeah. That you've got a nerve.

261
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:05,907
It's just for a minute.

262
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:08,559
Long enough for my friend Nuria
to admit defeat.

263
00:20:08,661 --> 00:20:11,029
This is my place.

264
00:20:11,094 --> 00:20:14,192
- Don't dare laugh at it.
- Why would I laugh?

265
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:17,043
It's nothing special,
but it's cheap.

266
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:24,588
- Do you like clowns?
- They're not clowns.

267
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:26,930
They're mime artists.

268
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:28,338
Pancho!

269
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,429
- I've got a cat.
- I hate cats.

270
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:35,348
They're almost as false
as actresses.

271
00:20:35,412 --> 00:20:37,420
Says the caterer.

272
00:20:38,261 --> 00:20:40,595
How do you pay for this?

273
00:20:40,662 --> 00:20:44,109
Do your parents help?
Do you work?

274
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:46,767
He's real nosy,
isn't he, Pancho?

275
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,692
I'm an arms dealer.

276
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,946
Fancy that! I always wanted to know
how arms dealers lived.

277
00:20:53,014 --> 00:20:54,867
Now you do.

278
00:21:16,918 --> 00:21:19,056
How can I eplain it to you?

279
00:21:20,022 --> 00:21:23,600
You wouldn't understand.
Even I don't understand.

280
00:21:23,702 --> 00:21:28,077
She was making coffee
and I started snooping around.

281
00:21:28,182 --> 00:21:31,892
Suddenly, I got this stupid feeling
a lot of people get.

282
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,583
Well, I like it.

283
00:21:33,654 --> 00:21:35,955
- What did you feel?
- That I loved her.

284
00:21:36,021 --> 00:21:39,283
- God, I'm even embarrassed to say it.
- I didn't hear you.

285
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:42,324
I said I like your place.

286
00:21:42,422 --> 00:21:45,652
And I like yours.
Let's swap.

287
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,270
You wouldn't like it
tomorrow morning.

288
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:51,211
I said it because of the decor.

289
00:21:51,318 --> 00:21:54,001
Your place is more personal.

290
00:21:54,102 --> 00:21:56,590
- And warmer.
- Warmer?

291
00:21:56,662 --> 00:21:58,995
- Yes.
- You think my house is cold?

292
00:21:59,061 --> 00:22:01,167
- A bit.
- And am I?

293
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,856
- I don't know.
- You said my house seemed cold.

294
00:22:04,853 --> 00:22:07,821
If you're waiting for me
to list your virtues, hard luck.

295
00:22:08,983 --> 00:22:11,087
You think you're real smart.

296
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,980
- Maybe.
- Well, you're wrong.

297
00:22:13,111 --> 00:22:15,379
I don't need you
to list my virtues.

298
00:22:15,478 --> 00:22:17,682
No, I'm sure you know
what they are.

299
00:22:17,782 --> 00:22:21,043
- But you'd like me to see them, too.
- So you say.

300
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:23,030
I'm not going
to argue about it.

301
00:22:23,158 --> 00:22:27,250
-Just as well. You'd lose.
- Oh, yeah?

302
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:31,377
But I don't want to argue either.
I propose we do the opposite.

303
00:22:31,478 --> 00:22:33,900
- We don't argue?
- We show our defects.

304
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,884
Great!

305
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,253
I hope you're being fair.

306
00:22:51,351 --> 00:22:53,423
This is absolutely you.

307
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,708
Well, mine is finished.

308
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:06,251
Fuck!
That's how you see me?

309
00:23:08,663 --> 00:23:11,281
- Did I go too far?
- Sign it.

310
00:23:15,382 --> 00:23:18,317
Let's see mine.

311
00:23:19,382 --> 00:23:20,757
It's lovely!

312
00:23:22,454 --> 00:23:25,171
- It's not a caricature.
- You see.

313
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:26,678
You draw beautifully.

314
00:23:26,743 --> 00:23:29,231
- I'll sell it to you.
- Miser. How much?

315
00:23:29,304 --> 00:23:31,605
As it's you,
I'll sell it for...

316
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:34,005
a kiss.

317
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,227
That smile's going to kill me!

318
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,976
It would be wrong
if we did anything tonight.

319
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:51,984
- Why?
- Pelayo. Remember?

320
00:23:52,823 --> 00:23:54,198
Your best friend.

321
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,992
He doesn't have to find out.
Besides, he'd do the same.

322
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,447
I see friendship
really matters to you.

323
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:05,780
It does. That's why
I wouldn't tell him.

324
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:15,724
Some people...

325
00:24:15,832 --> 00:24:19,857
say that they would be happy
with a normal life span.

326
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,090
But ''normal''means different things,
depending on--

327
00:24:23,191 --> 00:24:25,263
What are you looking at?

328
00:24:25,335 --> 00:24:27,157
I'm watching TV.

329
00:24:27,224 --> 00:24:30,998
The Romans, for instance,
lived only 25 years.

330
00:24:31,064 --> 00:24:32,438
Today...

331
00:24:32,503 --> 00:24:34,838
that figure has tripled,
which means that--

332
00:24:34,904 --> 00:24:39,661
- What the fuck is he on about?
- I saw this before.

333
00:24:39,736 --> 00:24:41,590
It's about cryonization.

334
00:24:41,655 --> 00:24:43,378
Cryo what?

335
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:45,749
When they freeze you
or something.

336
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:48,660
Like Walt Disney.

337
00:24:49,463 --> 00:24:51,317
Wow, that's cold!

338
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,687
Hey, you!

339
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,377
There won't be a landslide.

340
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,603
It isn't dangerous. The ground
is firm here and very solid.

341
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,456
- Are you leaving?
- I'm going home. Here's my number.

342
00:25:06,584 --> 00:25:09,039
But I'll call tomorrow.

343
00:25:09,144 --> 00:25:10,573
What for?

344
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,953
All right, I won't call.

345
00:25:16,023 --> 00:25:19,536
- Csar?
- What is it?

346
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:22,803
Come here.
I want to tell you a secret.

347
00:25:32,663 --> 00:25:34,005
Come here.

348
00:26:08,632 --> 00:26:10,093
Hello, darling.

349
00:26:11,384 --> 00:26:12,911
Did you follow me?

350
00:26:12,984 --> 00:26:15,155
Of course I didn't.

351
00:26:15,224 --> 00:26:18,158
But I had the feeling
we'd meet.

352
00:26:18,264 --> 00:26:20,915
- How was the brunette?
- Good. Why?

353
00:26:20,984 --> 00:26:24,497
From your face, I'd say
you didn't sleep with her.

354
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:28,276
Let me guess. You didn't sleep
with her, but you don't mind.

355
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,982
You have all the time
in the world for that.

356
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,423
And I bet you're
seeing her tomorrow.

357
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,172
- Brilliant.
- Aren't I? There's more.

358
00:26:37,274 --> 00:26:39,476
- Well?
- I scored at the party, too.

359
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:42,740
But he wasn't up for it,
so I'm still hot for it.

360
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:45,687
- And?
- And until you meet up again...

361
00:26:45,783 --> 00:26:48,435
with your Miss Universe,
you could have fun.

362
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,590
No. I think I prefer
to go home and sleep.

363
00:26:52,665 --> 00:26:55,665
Come on, Csar.
It's your birthday.

364
00:26:59,544 --> 00:27:02,032
- Skip it. I'm going home.
- What's up, Csar?

365
00:27:02,104 --> 00:27:03,533
Are you scared?

366
00:27:42,615 --> 00:27:45,714
- Want some of this?
- No, thanks.

367
00:27:45,785 --> 00:27:47,727
Sure, act innocent now.

368
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,254
I don't need that
to enjoy myself.

369
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,954
I see that.

370
00:27:52,793 --> 00:27:54,255
That's not a good idea.

371
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,149
Do what you want.

372
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:05,935
What's happiness for you?

373
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:09,170
- What?
- For me, this is happiness.

374
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:12,535
Being here with you.
What about you?

375
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:16,495
I can't handle heavy conversations
right now.

376
00:28:18,074 --> 00:28:21,782
Your thoughts are
somewhere else, right?

377
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,342
Maybe.

378
00:28:31,385 --> 00:28:33,208
One thing really bothers me.

379
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:37,872
- What?
- You know nothing about me.

380
00:28:37,946 --> 00:28:40,148
Except my name's Nuria
and I'm a good fuck.

381
00:28:40,216 --> 00:28:41,776
Two important things.

382
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,150
You don't know my address
or telephone number.

383
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:49,303
We have to start somewhere.
I'm going to see your house now.

384
00:28:51,032 --> 00:28:52,408
It's not far.

385
00:29:01,944 --> 00:29:03,800
Tell me something.

386
00:29:03,865 --> 00:29:06,353
Do you believe in God?

387
00:30:05,434 --> 00:30:07,343
- Hello.
- Hello.

388
00:30:09,593 --> 00:30:11,895
- How are you?
- You got home all right?

389
00:30:11,994 --> 00:30:15,376
Yeah. Well, I had
a horrible dream.

390
00:30:15,483 --> 00:30:17,719
That you never saw me again.

391
00:30:17,786 --> 00:30:20,851
Yes. I came out of your house,
go to my car...

392
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:23,126
and that crazy bitch
has been following me.

393
00:30:23,227 --> 00:30:25,233
- Who, that Nuria?
- Yes.

394
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:27,161
She comes over and says,
''Want a lift?''

395
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:29,715
She goes on so much
I don't know how to say no.

396
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:33,168
So I get in the car,
she drives faster and faster...

397
00:30:33,274 --> 00:30:35,096
and kills herself.

398
00:30:35,194 --> 00:30:36,984
- With me inside.
- That's horrible.

399
00:30:37,115 --> 00:30:38,522
But the worst part...

400
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,456
is that my face
is completely destroyed...

401
00:30:41,562 --> 00:30:44,245
like ''The Phantom of the Opera.''

402
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:46,932
I couldn't wake up.

403
00:30:47,033 --> 00:30:48,821
I was a monster.

404
00:30:49,786 --> 00:30:52,339
You're a monster anyway.

405
00:30:52,442 --> 00:30:56,119
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. I'm a monster, too.

406
00:30:56,186 --> 00:30:57,942
Look.

407
00:31:01,562 --> 00:31:03,350
How was your house?

408
00:31:04,378 --> 00:31:06,233
Was anyone left?

409
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,440
Left where?

410
00:31:08,507 --> 00:31:11,703
In your house.
There was a party, remember?

411
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,645
A party?

412
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:22,521
Dreaming is shit.

413
00:31:23,802 --> 00:31:26,170
Unless the dream was nice.

414
00:31:26,266 --> 00:31:29,333
In the park, children playing,
a girl who loves you.

415
00:31:29,434 --> 00:31:30,994
That's why.

416
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:33,750
Then you wake up
and you want to die.

417
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:46,290
At first, I didn't even have
the strength to react.

418
00:31:46,395 --> 00:31:48,697
I'd been in a coma
for three weeks.

419
00:31:48,794 --> 00:31:50,355
You were lucky.

420
00:31:50,427 --> 00:31:52,532
You could've died
like Nuria.

421
00:31:52,635 --> 00:31:55,864
And what?
I would've been better off.

422
00:31:55,963 --> 00:31:57,872
Did you see her body?

423
00:31:57,947 --> 00:32:00,598
- I never did.
- You think she didn't die?

424
00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:03,088
I'm like you.

425
00:32:03,194 --> 00:32:06,064
I only believe what I see.

426
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:10,201
Csar, show me your face,
please.

427
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:11,696
- What for?
- Look.

428
00:32:11,803 --> 00:32:14,323
It's true you had an accident.
It's true...

429
00:32:14,427 --> 00:32:16,434
that you were disfigured,
but not anymore.

430
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:18,841
Take that off.
The doctors fixed you.

431
00:32:18,907 --> 00:32:21,078
They didn't have
a fucking clue!

432
00:32:21,146 --> 00:32:24,627
In the accident, you didn't lose
just skin and some muscle.

433
00:32:24,698 --> 00:32:28,660
The blow was so severe it caused
a multiple fracture of the skull.

434
00:32:28,763 --> 00:32:31,578
We secured the osseous structure
with metal wires...

435
00:32:31,675 --> 00:32:34,642
and over that,
we reinserted the muscles...

436
00:32:34,748 --> 00:32:36,570
we could still retrieve.

437
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:39,035
Yes, very nice,
but I know all that.

438
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,586
I've had it explained to me
1 50 times.

439
00:32:41,658 --> 00:32:43,546
But you never say
when you'll operate.

440
00:32:43,643 --> 00:32:47,735
- I've been waiting two months.
- But we've operated three times.

441
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:51,031
I wouldn't call that
an operation. I'd call it--

442
00:32:51,098 --> 00:32:54,896
Well, I don't know
what you'd call it.

443
00:32:55,003 --> 00:32:57,043
The symmetry isn't perfect...

444
00:32:57,147 --> 00:33:00,562
but what we've done with your face is,
if I may say so...

445
00:33:00,668 --> 00:33:02,128
a craftsman's job.

446
00:33:02,235 --> 00:33:04,406
We can't work on skin
which is pure scars.

447
00:33:04,507 --> 00:33:06,678
No, no, there must be some way.

448
00:33:06,746 --> 00:33:08,122
- What?
- ''What?''

449
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:10,259
You're the doctors, aren't you?

450
00:33:11,547 --> 00:33:13,369
A transplant, whatever!

451
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:16,696
There's a problem with fibrosis,
if we operate again...

452
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:18,738
we may just cause
further damage.

453
00:33:18,844 --> 00:33:21,265
We'd need
millimetric precision...

454
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,282
and as of today
it's impossible.

455
00:33:24,442 --> 00:33:27,639
Let's look at this.
I'm not an idiot.

456
00:33:27,707 --> 00:33:29,977
Today, people change
their breasts.

457
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:32,017
They have hair implants.

458
00:33:32,154 --> 00:33:35,002
They even change the color
of their skin.

459
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:37,654
Are you saying that on
the threshold of the year 2000...

460
00:33:37,756 --> 00:33:42,773
you can't do a simple operation
and sort out this fuck-up?

461
00:33:42,874 --> 00:33:46,191
- It isn't so simple, Csar. Remember--
- Don't patronize me!

462
00:33:46,267 --> 00:33:48,089
Stop treating me like a child!

463
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,498
I'm not just any patient.

464
00:33:53,595 --> 00:33:55,865
And this isn't a welfare hospital.

465
00:33:58,044 --> 00:34:00,411
I'm willing to pay any amount.

466
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:05,049
You're in charge.

467
00:34:06,267 --> 00:34:08,471
They say you're the best
in your field.

468
00:34:08,539 --> 00:34:11,408
Well, invent something.
Experiment with me.

469
00:34:11,515 --> 00:34:14,362
I've seen patients
who've lost all their features...

470
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,216
who can't even talk.

471
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:19,163
At least you can look yourself
in the eyes.

472
00:34:19,228 --> 00:34:21,618
What good is that?

473
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:24,210
Every time I look in the mirror,
I want to die.

474
00:34:24,316 --> 00:34:26,356
Your case isn't so serious.

475
00:34:26,428 --> 00:34:28,249
Just learn to accept it.

476
00:34:28,347 --> 00:34:30,617
And who will accept me?

477
00:34:30,716 --> 00:34:33,847
Will you explain to the people
who look at me in the street?

478
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:38,074
Will you tell them
that looks aren't important?

479
00:34:38,141 --> 00:34:40,410
That beauty is on the inside?

480
00:34:46,108 --> 00:34:49,075
We'd like to show you something.

481
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:07,962
What is this?

482
00:35:08,028 --> 00:35:10,581
A facial prosthesis.

483
00:35:10,683 --> 00:35:13,683
We use it in extreme cases
of rejection like yours.

484
00:35:22,557 --> 00:35:23,897
This is shit!

485
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,330
It's not the best solution...

486
00:35:26,427 --> 00:35:28,665
but it's all we can do
for the moment.

487
00:35:28,765 --> 00:35:31,612
I want a face!
Not a mask!

488
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:35,541
I don't work miracles.

489
00:35:35,707 --> 00:35:38,839
That's what the bastard said.

490
00:35:38,908 --> 00:35:41,145
But in the end, they did.

491
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:43,504
Did what?

492
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:44,954
Work a miracle.

493
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:47,258
So it seems.

494
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:50,007
So it seems?
Things are or they aren't?

495
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:53,207
- Did they do it or not?
- I'm tired. Why don't you go?

496
00:35:57,724 --> 00:35:59,928
I'll be back on Tuesday.
Want anything?

497
00:36:00,029 --> 00:36:02,778
- No.
- All right. See you on Tuesday.

498
00:36:02,876 --> 00:36:04,763
A pad and a pencil.

499
00:36:04,828 --> 00:36:07,283
But don't tell them.
I don't want to owe them anything.

500
00:39:36,542 --> 00:39:38,550
Have I changed so much?

501
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:40,478
Because I recognize you.

502
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:47,644
How are you?

503
00:39:47,742 --> 00:39:49,531
''How are you?''

504
00:39:49,631 --> 00:39:54,715
You're playing a part now, but I don't
know what. Your lips are smiling.

505
00:39:54,782 --> 00:39:56,571
- But your eyes are trembling.
- What?

506
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,899
You're really very good
as an actress.

507
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:03,261
I asked you how you were.
You didn't answer.

508
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:06,775
I'm alive.
How should I be?

509
00:40:06,878 --> 00:40:08,569
And I'm tired.

510
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:12,795
Tired of waiting for you to call,
even to say ''Tough luck.''

511
00:40:12,863 --> 00:40:15,350
- I was busy.
- Bullshit!

512
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,664
I was afraid you'd feel uncomfortable
if I rang.

513
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:25,975
You were afraid
you'd feel uncomfortable.

514
00:40:26,077 --> 00:40:29,875
Afraid you couldn't
look me in the face, like now.

515
00:40:40,703 --> 00:40:42,525
That's not true.

516
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,053
I've often dreamed
of this moment.

517
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,492
What moment?

518
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:09,118
The moment we'd meet again.

519
00:41:09,183 --> 00:41:11,965
In my dream,
we were just like this.

520
00:41:12,063 --> 00:41:14,430
Here, in the park.

521
00:41:15,487 --> 00:41:18,334
Although something was different.

522
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,583
What?

523
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,472
It wasn't raining.

524
00:41:31,102 --> 00:41:32,629
I have to go, Csar.

525
00:41:32,703 --> 00:41:36,565
- What are you doing tomorrow night?
- Studying. I'm very busy.

526
00:41:36,671 --> 00:41:39,519
- It's Friday. We could meet.
- I've got a lot to do.

527
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,689
All right, so long.

528
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,366
Csar!

529
00:41:47,742 --> 00:41:49,782
We'll meet if you want.

530
00:41:50,943 --> 00:41:52,317
If you want.

531
00:41:54,335 --> 00:41:57,434
As soon as there is
the slightest possibility of death...

532
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:00,405
the stabilization and transport team
goes into action.

533
00:42:00,511 --> 00:42:02,617
Once the client is declared
legally dead...

534
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,535
he is put into
a maintenance capsule...

535
00:42:05,632 --> 00:42:08,860
and the transport legalities
are sorted out.

536
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:11,414
In the storeroom in Arizona
in the U.S.A...

537
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:15,131
a team of specialists prepare the body
for final freezing.

538
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:17,657
Among other measures...

539
00:42:17,728 --> 00:42:21,885
blood is replaced by a solution
which preserves the organs.

540
00:42:23,712 --> 00:42:24,889
Finally...

541
00:42:24,992 --> 00:42:27,162
the client is put
in the capsule....

542
00:42:27,263 --> 00:42:30,263
where he will remain
until medicine can reenergize him.

543
00:42:35,071 --> 00:42:37,111
To be honest,
I'd have to think it over.

544
00:42:37,184 --> 00:42:39,672
It's hard to accept the idea.

545
00:42:39,744 --> 00:42:42,079
How should we view it?

546
00:42:42,144 --> 00:42:46,486
We are, undoubtedly,
facing a major development...

547
00:42:46,591 --> 00:42:49,405
a new challenge for humanity.

548
00:42:49,503 --> 00:42:52,766
It's understandable that
the first reaction is rejection.

549
00:42:52,864 --> 00:42:55,732
We have now got the means
to do it.

550
00:42:55,808 --> 00:42:58,044
We've got the technology.

551
00:42:58,144 --> 00:43:01,493
But, above all, we have
sufficient moral maturity...

552
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,414
to understand what
this new step means...

553
00:43:04,512 --> 00:43:07,294
for human evolution,
to look at the future...

554
00:43:07,392 --> 00:43:10,359
and put an end to certain
meaningless taboos...

555
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:12,886
inherited from ancient religions...

556
00:43:12,992 --> 00:43:15,609
old and useless memories.

557
00:43:15,712 --> 00:43:18,079
Thank you for speaking to us.

558
00:43:18,144 --> 00:43:19,868
And thank you
to our audience--

559
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,413
- Hi.
- Hi.

560
00:43:47,487 --> 00:43:50,783
- What's that?
- Shit, isn't it?

561
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,596
But they suggested I wear it
in case of infection.

562
00:43:56,704 --> 00:44:00,021
Well, kid, what're you up to?

563
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,200
Arguing with doctors all day.

564
00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:04,246
- You should go out more.
- I'm trying.

565
00:44:04,352 --> 00:44:07,286
- What're you having?
- Rum and Coke. You want one?

566
00:44:07,392 --> 00:44:10,173
- Yes.
- I'll get you one.

567
00:44:10,271 --> 00:44:12,247
I'm going to the bathroom.

568
00:44:14,464 --> 00:44:17,082
- Take that off.
- Why?

569
00:44:17,184 --> 00:44:20,413
Don't you realize you won't
be able to hide your face?

570
00:44:21,344 --> 00:44:23,614
I told you,
it's to stop infections.

571
00:44:23,712 --> 00:44:25,119
Sure.

572
00:44:25,185 --> 00:44:28,632
If you're embarrassed, just go.
Nobody asked you to come.

573
00:44:28,703 --> 00:44:30,711
- Sofia did.
- What?

574
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,838
- She didn't want to be alone with you.
- Why not?

575
00:44:34,944 --> 00:44:38,241
- You're giving her a hard time.
- I'm having a hard time.

576
00:44:38,305 --> 00:44:40,376
Talk to a psychologist,
or to me.

577
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,936
Don't take it out on a girl
you met once.

578
00:44:43,042 --> 00:44:44,732
Did she say that?

579
00:44:45,922 --> 00:44:47,809
Did she say that?

580
00:44:48,864 --> 00:44:51,482
- Bitch!
- Come back!

581
00:44:59,392 --> 00:45:00,952
Whiskey and Coke.

582
00:45:01,025 --> 00:45:04,124
- What whiskey?
- What did you say?

583
00:45:06,305 --> 00:45:09,021
What whiskey?

584
00:45:09,088 --> 00:45:11,509
Why don't you ask me
to my face, son of a bitch?

585
00:45:17,025 --> 00:45:18,366
Ballantine's.

586
00:45:40,033 --> 00:45:42,815
- Same again.
- No, this one's on me.

587
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,667
- Why?
-Just is.

588
00:46:23,746 --> 00:46:26,266
Fix your face, man!

589
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:11,293
- Hello.
- Hello.

590
00:48:11,394 --> 00:48:15,191
- Where were you?
- Around.

591
00:48:15,265 --> 00:48:17,120
Pelayo went to look for you.

592
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,897
And I came to look for you.

593
00:48:20,995 --> 00:48:22,368
Why?

594
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:24,321
To-- No reason.

595
00:48:25,442 --> 00:48:28,192
To buy you a drink.

596
00:48:29,922 --> 00:48:32,671
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.

597
00:48:35,585 --> 00:48:38,205
Can you tell I'm elbowing in?

598
00:48:38,306 --> 00:48:41,536
The thing is,
I've got a problem.

599
00:48:41,634 --> 00:48:46,337
A girl's chasing me, and I need
some help to get rid of her.

600
00:48:46,435 --> 00:48:49,185
Shit, shit, shit!
She's coming this way.

601
00:48:49,283 --> 00:48:52,598
She's coming this way.
Don't look. Don't look.

602
00:48:54,626 --> 00:48:57,527
You carry on talking,
act as if he weren't here.

603
00:48:57,635 --> 00:48:59,457
I mean, as if I were here.

604
00:48:59,555 --> 00:49:01,562
Keep talking.
Tra-la-lee, tra-la-la.

605
00:49:01,667 --> 00:49:04,983
What a lovely conversation
we're having.

606
00:49:08,707 --> 00:49:10,943
So that's it, here we are...

607
00:49:11,042 --> 00:49:13,660
having a bit of a chat
about life.

608
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:15,072
That's enough!

609
00:49:25,284 --> 00:49:27,072
Where the hell were you?

610
00:49:29,251 --> 00:49:30,591
Around.

611
00:49:31,267 --> 00:49:33,338
I'm leaving. I'm tired.

612
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:36,639
You two stay if you want.

613
00:49:42,915 --> 00:49:45,981
Well, this is where
I leave you.

614
00:49:46,082 --> 00:49:48,702
- I'll see you home.
- No, I live very close.

615
00:49:48,803 --> 00:49:50,690
- I've got the motorbike.
- No.

616
00:49:50,786 --> 00:49:53,275
- Don't be silly.
- Lay off, Pelayo.

617
00:49:53,347 --> 00:49:55,256
She wants to go on her own.

618
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:57,502
Shut up. You're drunk.

619
00:49:57,571 --> 00:50:01,183
I might be drunk,
but I'm not an idiot.

620
00:50:01,283 --> 00:50:04,545
- Anyway, I'm not drunk.
- Really, you needn't bother.

621
00:50:04,611 --> 00:50:07,645
- As you wish.
- You're the one who's drunk.

622
00:50:07,747 --> 00:50:10,464
We'll call you to meet
some other day.

623
00:50:10,563 --> 00:50:12,602
All right. We could go
to the movies.

624
00:50:12,706 --> 00:50:14,529
- You hear?
- Great!

625
00:50:14,627 --> 00:50:16,667
Well, that's it, then.

626
00:50:19,075 --> 00:50:23,200
No, don't kiss me. You might
get poisoned by my drunken breath.

627
00:50:23,268 --> 00:50:27,261
Well, we'll meet up soon.

628
00:50:27,363 --> 00:50:28,672
Sure.

629
00:50:29,764 --> 00:50:31,550
We'll meet up soon.

630
00:50:45,571 --> 00:50:47,393
It's not cold.

631
00:50:54,755 --> 00:50:56,097
Well...

632
00:50:58,467 --> 00:51:01,281
I'm gonna have to go.

633
00:51:01,347 --> 00:51:03,257
Where are you going?

634
00:51:03,331 --> 00:51:05,601
I've just remembered
my bike is back there.

635
00:51:05,668 --> 00:51:09,563
- I'll go with you.
- No. Why? You're almost home now.

636
00:51:09,668 --> 00:51:12,449
- See you tomorrow.
- Pelayo, wait a minute.

637
00:51:14,307 --> 00:51:15,517
What?

638
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:23,458
I don't know.

639
00:51:24,388 --> 00:51:27,617
You drank too much.
We'll talk tomorrow if you want.

640
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:30,619
- Tomorrow I'll wish I were dead.
- You won't.

641
00:51:30,725 --> 00:51:32,632
You just need to rest.

642
00:51:33,668 --> 00:51:35,010
Pelayo!

643
00:51:39,876 --> 00:51:41,698
You're my best friend.

644
00:52:02,148 --> 00:52:03,970
Son of a bitch!

645
00:53:24,229 --> 00:53:25,375
Open your eyes.

646
00:53:32,357 --> 00:53:33,698
Csar.

647
00:53:42,437 --> 00:53:43,778
It's me.

648
00:53:47,845 --> 00:53:49,120
Sofia!

649
00:53:50,565 --> 00:53:53,020
- What are you doing here?
- Forgive me.

650
00:53:53,092 --> 00:53:54,336
Why?

651
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:12,485
I love you.

652
00:54:18,852 --> 00:54:20,195
Come on.

653
00:54:23,749 --> 00:54:27,132
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

654
00:54:27,237 --> 00:54:30,107
I still can't believe
this is really happening.

655
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:34,138
Where's Pelayo?

656
00:54:34,245 --> 00:54:37,060
I don't know.
He went with you, didn't he?

657
00:54:37,157 --> 00:54:38,880
Yes.

658
00:54:38,949 --> 00:54:40,324
Of course.

659
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:46,212
Come on.

660
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,357
God, what a sensation!

661
00:55:13,415 --> 00:55:14,941
Of what?

662
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:18,623
Do you ever feel
you've lived something before?

663
00:55:18,693 --> 00:55:20,547
Yes.

664
00:55:20,613 --> 00:55:22,948
Why is that?

665
00:55:23,046 --> 00:55:25,314
They say it's a lapse
in the brain.

666
00:55:26,246 --> 00:55:28,449
I've been here before.

667
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:33,092
It usually goes away
after a few seconds.

668
00:55:34,853 --> 00:55:37,155
I don't want it to go away.

669
00:55:50,086 --> 00:55:51,875
You've made use of your time.

670
00:55:53,414 --> 00:55:55,388
That's all there is here.

671
00:55:58,149 --> 00:56:00,736
Very pretty. Is it Sofia?

672
00:56:10,151 --> 00:56:12,703
How much longer will I be here?

673
00:56:12,807 --> 00:56:14,846
No one ever knows that.

674
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:17,700
Even my worst nightmare
was never like this place.

675
00:56:17,766 --> 00:56:21,410
It's a psychiatric penitentiary.
No more, no less.

676
00:56:24,389 --> 00:56:27,651
- I shouldn't be here.
- You're accused of murder.

677
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,566
- I don't even know what I did.
- Tell me something.

678
00:56:30,662 --> 00:56:35,647
-Does the name Eli mean anything to you?
-Eli?

679
00:56:35,718 --> 00:56:37,889
You know a girl with that name?

680
00:56:37,957 --> 00:56:40,608
No. Why do you ask?

681
00:56:40,678 --> 00:56:43,493
It seems you kept
repeating it last night.

682
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:46,144
I guess I was dreaming.

683
00:56:46,246 --> 00:56:49,409
- What did you dream?
- I can't remember.

684
00:56:49,478 --> 00:56:53,755
- It could be important.
- How could it be important?

685
00:56:53,863 --> 00:56:57,691
Look, I can prove you didn't know
what you were doing...

686
00:56:57,765 --> 00:57:00,613
but first I have to find
some explanation for all this.

687
00:57:00,678 --> 00:57:03,973
There is no explanation.
I told you the other day.

688
00:57:04,038 --> 00:57:05,499
What did you dream, Csar?

689
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:10,053
I don't know.

690
00:57:11,207 --> 00:57:13,442
I only remember bits.

691
00:57:15,878 --> 00:57:18,846
First, I'm in a kind of office.

692
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:21,121
A secretary shows me
into another office.

693
00:57:22,247 --> 00:57:25,247
There's a photo
of a sunset and a man.

694
00:57:26,279 --> 00:57:28,613
Then, I don't know.

695
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:31,679
- They show me lots of papers.
- What papers?

696
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:33,342
I don't know.

697
00:57:33,446 --> 00:57:35,934
But I sign them.

698
00:57:36,006 --> 00:57:38,788
Does the office belong
to your company?

699
00:57:38,886 --> 00:57:41,701
No, I don't recognize it.

700
00:57:41,766 --> 00:57:43,806
You dreamed of a place
you'd never been?

701
00:57:43,879 --> 00:57:47,424
Yes. That happens a lot,
doesn't it?

702
00:57:47,526 --> 00:57:50,561
Are they the papers
you signed with the doctors?

703
00:57:50,662 --> 00:57:54,307
No, what happened with the doctors
was surreal.

704
00:57:54,407 --> 00:57:57,755
- Why?
- They rang me to go to the hospital.

705
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:02,459
When I arrived,
the whole surgical team was waiting.

706
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:08,066
For months, those faces had looked at me
with indifference and impotence.

707
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:10,623
Now they were all smiles.

708
00:58:10,727 --> 00:58:15,484
The same bastard who had said my case
was hopeless talked about an operation.

709
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:19,650
They had a new revolutionary system
in the clinic now.

710
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:24,126
They said that within two weeks my face
would be completely reconstructed.

711
00:58:24,231 --> 00:58:26,053
You didn't believe them?

712
00:58:26,151 --> 00:58:31,748
Not at first. I thought it was just
a way to get more money out of me.

713
00:58:31,847 --> 00:58:35,142
But they showed me
all the gadgets for the operation.

714
00:58:35,208 --> 00:58:38,338
It looked like science fiction.

715
00:58:38,406 --> 00:58:41,952
All I could see were cables,
switches, monitors.

716
00:58:42,087 --> 00:58:46,211
Actually, I never really knew
what they were going to do.

717
00:58:46,311 --> 00:58:48,253
But I thought I'd nothing to lose.

718
00:58:48,327 --> 00:58:51,174
Those people
were used to rhinoplasties...

719
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:55,364
liposuctions, hair transplants,
but my operation was much more.

720
00:58:55,463 --> 00:58:57,601
In less than a week...

721
00:58:57,704 --> 00:59:00,485
my life had turned around.

722
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:05,090
One night, I was lying
on the ground drunk, waiting to die.

723
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:07,363
The net morning,
my dreams were coming true...

724
00:59:07,462 --> 00:59:09,699
like in the movies.

725
00:59:09,767 --> 00:59:13,598
Sofia loved me, and the doctors
found the miracle cure.

726
00:59:13,704 --> 00:59:17,280
I don't know.
Obviously, I was suspicious.

727
00:59:17,382 --> 00:59:19,041
Suspicious?

728
00:59:19,143 --> 00:59:22,372
Of whom? Of what?

729
00:59:22,439 --> 00:59:24,294
I don't know.

730
00:59:25,447 --> 00:59:27,357
In life, you never know.

731
00:59:27,464 --> 00:59:29,886
Happiness comes
when you least expect it.

732
00:59:32,904 --> 00:59:35,206
I once knew a guy
who was alone in the world.

733
00:59:35,303 --> 00:59:38,020
Suddenly, he was married
with two daughters.

734
00:59:38,087 --> 00:59:41,600
Fuck, you've got
a strange idea of happiness.

735
00:59:50,088 --> 00:59:53,863
Well, that depends on the individual.
What's happiness for you?

736
00:59:53,928 --> 00:59:55,816
What's happiness for you?

737
00:59:58,246 --> 01:00:00,254
Don't ask any more stupid questions.

738
01:00:00,328 --> 01:00:03,590
But at that time, you were happy.
Or weren't you?

739
01:00:03,688 --> 01:00:06,885
So what?
My life now is shit.

740
01:00:06,984 --> 01:00:11,261
All I can do is eat, shit, sleep
and dream of my memories.

741
01:00:12,488 --> 01:00:14,692
It's good that you remember.

742
01:00:29,127 --> 01:00:32,390
- Well?
- Well, what?

743
01:00:32,488 --> 01:00:36,547
They were to remove
the plates today.

744
01:00:36,648 --> 01:00:39,495
- And they did.
- And?

745
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:43,138
Well, my ears are where
they should be.

746
01:00:43,207 --> 01:00:45,346
Csar, don't scare me.

747
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:50,723
- Take off the plates.
- You can do it.

748
01:02:06,568 --> 01:02:08,708
How did they do it?

749
01:02:44,648 --> 01:02:49,089
Wait.Just to say
that I love you.

750
01:02:50,248 --> 01:02:53,249
You're going too fast...

751
01:02:53,321 --> 01:02:56,453
considering we met yesterday.

752
01:02:56,553 --> 01:02:57,601
Yesterday?

753
01:02:57,706 --> 01:03:00,520
My birthday, don't you remember?

754
01:03:01,768 --> 01:03:05,730
I met an incredible girl.
Her name was Sofia.

755
01:03:05,801 --> 01:03:09,280
But today I woke up feeling great...

756
01:03:09,384 --> 01:03:11,807
and now I'm with the girl again.

757
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:18,437
What is it?

758
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:22,118
What is it?

759
01:03:23,689 --> 01:03:26,242
If you want me to move,
you have to put in a coin.

760
01:03:30,921 --> 01:03:32,328
Ting!

761
01:03:39,752 --> 01:03:43,582
We never appreciate the good moments
till they're over.

762
01:03:43,688 --> 01:03:45,696
Maybe that's why
they're good moments.

763
01:03:45,769 --> 01:03:48,933
- We don't stop to think about them.
- Perhaps.

764
01:03:49,001 --> 01:03:50,856
What happened to Pelayo?

765
01:03:50,922 --> 01:03:53,409
- What's up?
- Hang on a minute.

766
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:56,104
- That's it.
- About time.

767
01:03:56,169 --> 01:03:59,430
- Want anything else?
- No, thanks.

768
01:04:03,049 --> 01:04:04,871
How's things, Pelayo?

769
01:04:04,969 --> 01:04:06,530
Fine.

770
01:04:06,633 --> 01:04:08,705
How's things, Pelayo?

771
01:04:09,769 --> 01:04:11,199
Fine.

772
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:13,476
Yeah.

773
01:04:15,113 --> 01:04:17,351
I'm actually not as fucked up
as I look.

774
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:20,100
I'm used to you always winning,
you bastard.

775
01:04:20,169 --> 01:04:23,038
- And Sofia isn't that great.
- You said she was ideal.

776
01:04:23,146 --> 01:04:24,771
Really?

777
01:04:26,314 --> 01:04:28,223
I was drunk.

778
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:30,272
Anyway, we're friends.

779
01:04:40,649 --> 01:04:43,366
Bastard!

780
01:04:43,465 --> 01:04:46,465
- What's that on your face?
- What?

781
01:04:49,866 --> 01:04:52,550
- Fuck, there's a seam opening!
- What are you on about?

782
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:00,392
You fucking idiot!

783
01:05:58,027 --> 01:05:59,968
What's the matter?

784
01:06:02,570 --> 01:06:04,393
I hate dreaming.

785
01:06:51,596 --> 01:06:53,504
You're tickling me.

786
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:24,554
What's wrong?

787
01:07:26,347 --> 01:07:27,690
What is it?

788
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,369
- Where's Sofia?
- What?

789
01:07:33,804 --> 01:07:35,875
What have you done with Sofia?

790
01:07:36,972 --> 01:07:38,794
- I am Sofia.
- You bitch!

791
01:07:43,211 --> 01:07:46,528
- You're mad. You're mad.
- Where is she?

792
01:08:08,011 --> 01:08:10,051
In one minute,
I'm going to call the police.

793
01:08:10,123 --> 01:08:13,439
You'll be in trouble
if Sofia doesn't appear.

794
01:08:13,548 --> 01:08:15,970
So you survived the accident.

795
01:08:16,043 --> 01:08:17,832
What accident?

796
01:08:17,932 --> 01:08:21,280
- Whose body was it?
- I didn't have an accident.

797
01:08:21,386 --> 01:08:24,485
No. It wasn't an accident.
It was attempted murder.

798
01:08:24,587 --> 01:08:26,627
A pity you didn't see my face, bitch!

799
01:08:26,731 --> 01:08:30,790
- Why do this? How have I changed?
- You haven't.

800
01:08:30,891 --> 01:08:33,707
You're the same lunatic
who gate-crashed my party.

801
01:08:33,771 --> 01:08:37,666
I'm the girl you made love to just now.
I'm Sofia.

802
01:08:37,771 --> 01:08:41,188
Stop saying you're Sofia,
do you hear?

803
01:08:41,292 --> 01:08:44,291
Don't say her name!

804
01:08:45,323 --> 01:08:47,080
You won't tell me where she is.

805
01:08:49,611 --> 01:08:51,717
You never will.

806
01:08:55,851 --> 01:08:57,161
Csar.

807
01:08:59,725 --> 01:09:01,099
I love you.

808
01:09:05,003 --> 01:09:06,891
- Hello.
- Hello.

809
01:09:11,211 --> 01:09:13,415
You can go. I'll see to this.

810
01:09:15,724 --> 01:09:17,415
Right.

811
01:09:17,484 --> 01:09:19,720
Let me get this clear.

812
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:25,506
- Where were you last night?
- At home. I told that gentleman.

813
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:27,499
At home. With whom?

814
01:09:27,595 --> 01:09:30,825
- With a girl.
- The girl just questioned?

815
01:09:30,892 --> 01:09:33,543
No, that's another girl.
I was with Sofia.

816
01:09:33,612 --> 01:09:35,434
The girl I spoke to was Sofia.

817
01:09:35,532 --> 01:09:37,737
Yes, that's what she says,
but it's a lie.

818
01:09:37,805 --> 01:09:41,416
- Who is she then?
- She's Nuria.

819
01:09:41,516 --> 01:09:42,759
Nuria what?

820
01:09:45,357 --> 01:09:47,625
I don't know.
She never told me her surname.

821
01:09:47,691 --> 01:09:50,026
Let's see.

822
01:09:50,092 --> 01:09:53,736
You were at home with a girl
called Sofia, and suddenly--

823
01:09:53,803 --> 01:09:56,554
I go to the bathroom, come back,
and she's in Sofia's place.

824
01:09:56,653 --> 01:09:57,830
Where's Sofia?

825
01:09:57,933 --> 01:09:59,722
Ask Nuria.
She's pretending to be her.

826
01:10:02,092 --> 01:10:04,295
You don't know her surname?

827
01:10:04,396 --> 01:10:06,305
But who do you believe, her or me?

828
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:10,438
Listen, that girl's papers
are all in order. We've let her go.

829
01:10:11,852 --> 01:10:15,813
- You've what?
- And I assure you she's called Sofia.

830
01:10:15,884 --> 01:10:19,179
Sofia Cueto, and she lives
at number 2, Quirs St.

831
01:10:19,276 --> 01:10:21,513
- No!
- No, what?

832
01:10:21,613 --> 01:10:25,670
Well, yes, but that's another girl.
I know the real Sofia.

833
01:10:25,772 --> 01:10:27,977
Then tell me where she is.

834
01:10:29,164 --> 01:10:32,646
Because, legally the girl
you're talking about...

835
01:10:32,749 --> 01:10:35,564
only exists in your imagination.

836
01:10:38,412 --> 01:10:40,715
- I don't believe this.
- And another thing.

837
01:10:41,773 --> 01:10:44,138
The girl looks as if she'd been hit.

838
01:10:44,204 --> 01:10:46,310
She was in my house
supplanting my girlfriend!

839
01:10:46,412 --> 01:10:50,306
I don't know why,
but she wouldn't press charges.

840
01:10:51,277 --> 01:10:54,092
Fucking great!
So now she's the victim!

841
01:10:54,189 --> 01:10:56,425
Tell me.
Are you on drugs?

842
01:10:56,492 --> 01:10:59,974
- God!
- You were under psychiatric care.

843
01:11:00,045 --> 01:11:02,825
My face was destroyed
in a car crash she caused!

844
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:04,550
Your face looks fine.

845
01:11:04,652 --> 01:11:06,408
Because--

846
01:11:06,508 --> 01:11:09,258
It doesn't matter.
I've got nothing more to say.

847
01:11:09,325 --> 01:11:10,852
Young man.

848
01:11:10,925 --> 01:11:13,925
I'd advise you to see a psychiatrist.

849
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:22,691
Are you an idiot?

850
01:11:22,798 --> 01:11:25,185
- What the fuck is this?
- What do you mean?

851
01:11:25,292 --> 01:11:29,635
If you wanted to fuck her up,
there are other ways to do it!

852
01:11:30,733 --> 01:11:33,516
- Keep away from Sofia!
- It isn't Sofia. It's Nuria!

853
01:11:33,613 --> 01:11:34,856
Nuria's dead!

854
01:11:34,924 --> 01:11:37,892
Calm down, or you'll be sleeping
in a cell tonight!

855
01:11:37,996 --> 01:11:40,136
Don't ever talk to me again!

856
01:11:40,206 --> 01:11:43,522
I don't know what the cops told you,
but Nuria is alive!

857
01:11:43,628 --> 01:11:45,603
The cops didn't tell me,
Sofia did.

858
01:11:45,709 --> 01:11:48,131
Listen, you spoke to her by phone,
didn't you?

859
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:50,539
- Let go!
- It wasn't Sofia.

860
01:11:50,605 --> 01:11:53,704
Nuria can imitate her voice.
She took her ID, her apartment.

861
01:11:53,773 --> 01:11:57,733
It wasn't over the phone.
I've just dropped her home.

862
01:11:57,837 --> 01:11:59,660
She looked like this.

863
01:12:06,093 --> 01:12:08,460
Nice photo, isn't it?

864
01:12:08,556 --> 01:12:10,499
You going to say that isn't Sofia?

865
01:12:10,572 --> 01:12:13,572
But that's--
Is this a joke or what?

866
01:12:13,645 --> 01:12:15,434
You're crazy, man.

867
01:12:16,653 --> 01:12:19,337
I'm crazy? I'm crazy?

868
01:12:20,975 --> 01:12:24,105
You're the ones who are mad!
You're all mad!

869
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,060
Let go of me!

870
01:12:27,213 --> 01:12:29,035
God, what's happening?

871
01:12:30,094 --> 01:12:31,916
It's my partners, right?

872
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:34,151
They've paid you.
This is a plot!

873
01:12:34,253 --> 01:12:37,996
Look at yourself. You haven't
been right since the accident.

874
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:40,717
Fuck you!

875
01:12:42,894 --> 01:12:44,454
Are you saying--

876
01:12:44,557 --> 01:12:48,584
Are you saying this is the girl
you ran after the other night?

877
01:12:48,654 --> 01:12:50,858
- Is this your ideal girl?
- Yes!

878
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:54,122
And you took her.

879
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:04,004
You need a psychiatrist!

880
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,482
Problems?

881
01:13:13,997 --> 01:13:15,820
I'm in no mood, so just--

882
01:13:15,918 --> 01:13:18,373
There's an explanation for all this.

883
01:13:18,445 --> 01:13:19,820
Csar.

884
01:13:22,733 --> 01:13:24,107
Who are you?

885
01:13:24,173 --> 01:13:26,924
- You've seen me on TV.
- What do you want?

886
01:13:28,653 --> 01:13:30,824
I'm here to help you.

887
01:13:30,893 --> 01:13:34,375
First of all, it's very important
that you calm down.

888
01:13:34,478 --> 01:13:35,656
Calm down?

889
01:13:35,759 --> 01:13:39,141
You must overcome your fears
and regain control.

890
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:42,062
What control do you mean?
I'm fine.

891
01:13:42,127 --> 01:13:43,785
Who says you aren't?

892
01:13:43,854 --> 01:13:46,472
They do. All of them.

893
01:13:46,573 --> 01:13:48,548
They think I'm mad.

894
01:13:48,654 --> 01:13:50,541
No, of course you're not mad.

895
01:13:50,605 --> 01:13:55,014
But what if I told you
you were dreaming?

896
01:13:59,534 --> 01:14:00,941
No, no, no.

897
01:14:01,006 --> 01:14:02,795
Why not?

898
01:14:02,894 --> 01:14:06,210
- I know what's real, and this is real.
- How do you know?

899
01:14:06,318 --> 01:14:08,773
You discover your dreams
when you wake.

900
01:14:08,878 --> 01:14:10,536
I just know.

901
01:14:10,637 --> 01:14:14,151
- My dreams are much simpler than this.
- No dream is simple.

902
01:14:14,254 --> 01:14:16,939
Look at those people.

903
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:20,171
They seem to be talking
about their own business.

904
01:14:20,271 --> 01:14:22,572
Completely unaware of you.

905
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:26,500
And yet, they could be there
because you wanted it.

906
01:14:26,574 --> 01:14:31,179
What's more, you could have them
at your complete service...

907
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:33,350
or have them destroy you.

908
01:14:33,454 --> 01:14:35,495
I want them to be quiet.

909
01:14:35,598 --> 01:14:37,421
And you, too.

910
01:14:50,894 --> 01:14:52,716
See?

911
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:05,196
What's going on here?

912
01:15:08,847 --> 01:15:10,853
Someone tell me the fucking truth!

913
01:15:10,958 --> 01:15:14,536
The truth?
Maybe you couldn't take it.

914
01:15:17,935 --> 01:15:21,513
It had to be a setup,
a big joke to drive me crazy.

915
01:15:21,614 --> 01:15:24,168
They all knew. Nuria, Pelayo,
the police, the guy at the bar.

916
01:15:24,272 --> 01:15:26,310
- Who was he?
- I don't know.

917
01:15:26,413 --> 01:15:28,716
You said you saw him on TV.
On what program?

918
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:30,276
I don't know!

919
01:15:31,374 --> 01:15:34,505
I don't know. One that talked
about freezing the dead.

920
01:15:34,574 --> 01:15:37,226
- Freezing the dead?
- Cryonization.

921
01:15:37,294 --> 01:15:39,335
Like they did to Walt Disney.

922
01:15:44,367 --> 01:15:47,116
Maybe I can help you remember.

923
01:15:47,215 --> 01:15:48,840
Is that a threat?

924
01:15:52,334 --> 01:15:53,895
Lie down.

925
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,461
What's that?

926
01:16:00,559 --> 01:16:01,966
A syringe.

927
01:16:05,135 --> 01:16:06,695
Relax.

928
01:16:06,767 --> 01:16:08,328
My arm's stinging.

929
01:16:08,431 --> 01:16:10,820
It's a tranquilizer.

930
01:16:10,894 --> 01:16:12,520
What for?

931
01:16:21,135 --> 01:16:23,501
These things are all bullshit.

932
01:16:23,568 --> 01:16:27,342
If you'd trusted psychiatrists more,
you mightn't be here now.

933
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:33,225
That finger,
it's making me nervous.

934
01:16:33,296 --> 01:16:35,183
You needn't be afraid.

935
01:16:35,247 --> 01:16:37,768
- I'm not afraid.
- Stop talking and concentrate.

936
01:16:37,871 --> 01:16:39,976
Come on.

937
01:16:40,046 --> 01:16:41,422
Fuck.

938
01:16:43,088 --> 01:16:44,615
I feel dizzy.

939
01:16:44,687 --> 01:16:46,116
Good-bye, Csar.

940
01:16:50,351 --> 01:16:53,897
Very good. Now let's see
if you can tell me about that dream.

941
01:16:56,048 --> 01:16:59,179
- In my dream, it isn't raining.
- The office dream.

942
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,296
Eli.

943
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,701
That's it. I want you
to tell me who Eli is.

944
01:17:02,768 --> 01:17:05,288
-A secretary.
- Eli is a secretary?

945
01:17:05,392 --> 01:17:08,010
She tells me to go in.
They're epecting me.

946
01:17:08,112 --> 01:17:09,900
Who's epecting you?

947
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,149
- The Frenchman from the TV.
- Sit down, please.

948
01:17:14,256 --> 01:17:16,295
It's a contract.

949
01:17:16,367 --> 01:17:18,276
- Eli--
- Csar, who is Eli?

950
01:17:20,336 --> 01:17:23,336
You won't regret it.
Sign.

951
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:27,148
- What are you signing?
- Eli will see to everything.

952
01:17:27,215 --> 01:17:29,671
What have you signed?

953
01:17:33,455 --> 01:17:34,797
What's wrong?

954
01:17:34,896 --> 01:17:36,717
What's wrong, Csar?

955
01:17:36,815 --> 01:17:38,638
Why are you crying?

956
01:17:38,736 --> 01:17:41,519
- I'm going to die.
- You're not going to die.

957
01:17:43,472 --> 01:17:45,709
- I don't know how many.
- How many what?

958
01:17:45,776 --> 01:17:48,775
- Pills.
- You took pills?

959
01:17:48,848 --> 01:17:52,230
- How many should I take?
- Pills to feel better?

960
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:53,829
I don't want to.

961
01:17:53,936 --> 01:17:56,872
When I count to three,
you'll wake up. One. Two.

962
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,938
I thought that, up to now,
you'd told me the truth.

963
01:18:06,512 --> 01:18:08,333
What do you mean?

964
01:18:08,431 --> 01:18:10,253
You said you took nothing.

965
01:18:11,215 --> 01:18:13,583
Csar, I'll ask you
for the last time.

966
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:16,462
- Did you take drugs?
- Fuck! Why does everyone--

967
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:19,113
Stop playacting.
Tell me the truth!

968
01:18:19,215 --> 01:18:21,900
- I must know what you took.
- I didn't take anything!

969
01:18:21,969 --> 01:18:26,093
Don't you see? Your brain
could have been affected by the pills.

970
01:18:26,192 --> 01:18:28,296
- I didn't take any!
- You said you did!

971
01:18:28,367 --> 01:18:30,572
It's just a dream!

972
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:32,614
Why make it more important
than it is?

973
01:18:32,688 --> 01:18:35,852
Can't you tell dreams from reality?
I can!

974
01:18:35,952 --> 01:18:39,149
Really? Don't make me laugh!

975
01:18:39,217 --> 01:18:42,032
Bodies that come to life,
people who disappear...

976
01:18:42,097 --> 01:18:44,039
you, the Phantom of the Opera!

977
01:18:48,496 --> 01:18:51,693
Tell me one thing. Do you remember
what you did to Sofia?

978
01:18:54,736 --> 01:18:56,110
It wasn't Sofia.

979
01:18:56,176 --> 01:19:00,170
I don't care who it was.
What did you do to her?

980
01:19:01,297 --> 01:19:03,020
You remember?

981
01:20:35,889 --> 01:20:37,264
My God!

982
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:43,591
What are you doing?
I thought you were a burglar.

983
01:20:46,417 --> 01:20:47,978
Who are you?

984
01:20:48,081 --> 01:20:49,575
I'm Sofia.

985
01:20:50,417 --> 01:20:52,239
Sofia.

986
01:20:54,736 --> 01:20:56,842
You're not Sofia.

987
01:21:01,490 --> 01:21:03,856
Csar, this will all
be over soon.

988
01:21:03,953 --> 01:21:05,775
We'll be together again.

989
01:21:07,058 --> 01:21:09,904
You'll forget Nuria
and I won't be afraid of you.

990
01:21:13,296 --> 01:21:16,296
- I'm thirsty.
- I'll get some water.

991
01:21:55,315 --> 01:21:56,525
Sofia!

992
01:21:58,258 --> 01:22:00,624
Yes, Csar, I'm Sofia.

993
01:22:04,659 --> 01:22:06,252
I'm Sofia.

994
01:23:36,658 --> 01:23:39,114
I want to see you.

995
01:23:39,218 --> 01:23:42,218
I want to see you.
I want to see you!

996
01:23:46,898 --> 01:23:48,687
I want to see you!

997
01:25:27,476 --> 01:25:29,843
At times you dream
you're with someone.

998
01:25:30,036 --> 01:25:32,555
For example, your father.

999
01:25:32,659 --> 01:25:35,342
In seconds,
he becomes your mother...

1000
01:25:35,411 --> 01:25:39,154
and then, the news vendor
on the corner.

1001
01:25:39,219 --> 01:25:43,049
Yet you still feel as if
you're talking to the same person.

1002
01:25:44,276 --> 01:25:48,946
You thought you were at home, but
suddenly you realize you're in a school.

1003
01:25:49,012 --> 01:25:52,327
Or a hospital, or a prison.

1004
01:25:54,035 --> 01:25:56,403
Dreams are like that.

1005
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:59,217
And at times the mind behaves
as if it were in a dream.

1006
01:25:59,315 --> 01:26:01,965
- You know what derangement is?
- For fuck's sake!

1007
01:26:02,099 --> 01:26:05,361
Say I'm stupid if you want,
but this isn't derangement!

1008
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:07,370
Then what is it?

1009
01:26:07,476 --> 01:26:09,964
You tell me,
because I don't know.

1010
01:26:11,059 --> 01:26:13,907
I don't know what's in here,
or why you killed your girlfriend.

1011
01:26:13,971 --> 01:26:16,939
I don't know who Eli is,
or that man from the TV.

1012
01:26:17,044 --> 01:26:20,241
- I don't know anything.
- That makes two of us.

1013
01:26:31,412 --> 01:26:34,193
Will you still come
after the trial?

1014
01:26:34,259 --> 01:26:36,234
Don't you hate the sight of me?

1015
01:26:38,932 --> 01:26:41,932
- What will you plead?
- Why do you ask that?

1016
01:26:42,037 --> 01:26:44,851
The first hearing
is next week.

1017
01:26:48,756 --> 01:26:50,414
Temporary derangement.

1018
01:26:50,516 --> 01:26:53,199
It's your best chance.

1019
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:55,209
Even so, it won't be much use.

1020
01:26:55,315 --> 01:26:57,705
They won't believe me.

1021
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:59,635
Even I don't believe it.

1022
01:26:59,699 --> 01:27:01,042
What do you believe?

1023
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:06,639
I think you're very sick
and should stay here for a long time.

1024
01:27:08,213 --> 01:27:10,863
Don't worry.
I'll get at least 20 years.

1025
01:27:10,933 --> 01:27:13,898
Csar, you may not believe it,
but I care about you.

1026
01:27:13,972 --> 01:27:16,394
I care a lot about you.

1027
01:27:18,324 --> 01:27:19,819
Look, kid.

1028
01:27:19,892 --> 01:27:23,340
Your case interests me.
I'm sorry about what's happened.

1029
01:27:23,444 --> 01:27:26,706
I even thought someone
was playing tricks on you, but...

1030
01:27:26,773 --> 01:27:29,140
I can't and mustn't
exceed my duties.

1031
01:27:29,238 --> 01:27:32,138
- I'm just a psychiatrist.
- You don't look like one.

1032
01:27:32,243 --> 01:27:34,699
- What do I look like?
- My father.

1033
01:27:34,804 --> 01:27:36,746
Preaching at me all day.

1034
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:39,537
Your father's dead.

1035
01:27:39,636 --> 01:27:41,163
There you go.

1036
01:27:48,884 --> 01:27:52,878
By the way, what happened to that man
with the wife and two daughters?

1037
01:27:57,013 --> 01:27:58,867
I don't know.
I never saw him again.

1038
01:27:58,933 --> 01:28:00,787
Take my advice, get a lawyer.

1039
01:28:00,852 --> 01:28:02,893
Good-bye, Csar.

1040
01:28:05,941 --> 01:28:07,501
Good-bye.

1041
01:28:07,573 --> 01:28:11,403
...the main Spanish investment,
but certainly the most novel.

1042
01:28:26,196 --> 01:28:28,585
...its economic presence in Cuba.

1043
01:28:28,661 --> 01:28:31,979
...depending on the era.

1044
01:28:32,054 --> 01:28:35,849
In the Roman Empire, for eample,
the normal thing was to live...

1045
01:28:35,956 --> 01:28:37,843
only 25 years.

1046
01:28:44,118 --> 01:28:46,060
Who's got the remote?

1047
01:28:47,606 --> 01:28:49,580
Give it to me!

1048
01:28:56,212 --> 01:28:58,155
Get it off him!

1049
01:29:13,492 --> 01:29:15,281
What's up?

1050
01:29:15,381 --> 01:29:17,901
There's a computer here
connected to Internet.

1051
01:29:17,973 --> 01:29:20,756
They'll only let me use it
if you come with me.

1052
01:29:20,822 --> 01:29:24,137
- Why do you want Internet?
- I know what Eli is.

1053
01:29:24,213 --> 01:29:25,587
Wait!

1054
01:29:25,653 --> 01:29:28,437
Eli isn't a person,
it's a company.

1055
01:29:28,502 --> 01:29:30,737
- How do you know?
- It isn't Eli.

1056
01:29:30,837 --> 01:29:33,738
It's L.E. They're the initials
of an American company.

1057
01:29:33,845 --> 01:29:37,228
- What are you doing?
- Checking the ''initials program.''

1058
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:39,821
It'll tell us all it knows
about L.E.

1059
01:29:44,533 --> 01:29:45,614
Shit!

1060
01:29:45,718 --> 01:29:48,686
- It'll take ages.
- No, wait.

1061
01:29:54,325 --> 01:29:55,951
Fuck!

1062
01:29:56,022 --> 01:29:58,193
I feel like
I've done this before.

1063
01:29:58,261 --> 01:30:00,814
A cerebral dysfunction.
A lapse in the brain.

1064
01:30:00,918 --> 01:30:03,306
No, not this time.

1065
01:30:03,381 --> 01:30:04,755
My God!

1066
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:07,025
- That's it.
- The photo in your dream?

1067
01:30:07,126 --> 01:30:10,061
I had to see it before
I could dream about it, right?

1068
01:30:10,133 --> 01:30:11,344
''Cyronics.''

1069
01:30:11,414 --> 01:30:13,389
- Cryonization.
- I'll print this.

1070
01:30:13,461 --> 01:30:17,421
Wait a minute. I don't see
what this has to do with your case.

1071
01:30:17,525 --> 01:30:20,787
The key is in here.
Look, there's an office in Madrid.

1072
01:30:20,853 --> 01:30:23,155
I'll go and check it out.

1073
01:30:23,221 --> 01:30:25,588
No! I have to go, too.

1074
01:30:25,653 --> 01:30:29,134
- I can't get you out of here.
- I'd be let out under supervision.

1075
01:30:29,237 --> 01:30:30,863
Make up some excuse.

1076
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:32,625
- It isn't easy.
- You can do it.

1077
01:30:32,695 --> 01:30:35,181
You know something else,
don't you?

1078
01:30:37,941 --> 01:30:39,315
I don't know anything.

1079
01:30:39,381 --> 01:30:42,065
- I've just got a feeling.
- What is it?

1080
01:30:42,166 --> 01:30:44,817
I have to go there,
one way or another.

1081
01:31:27,062 --> 01:31:31,056
Let's get things straight.
We're outside, I'm armed.

1082
01:31:31,158 --> 01:31:33,615
My job is to stop you
doing anything stupid.

1083
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:35,888
Try anything,
and you get a bullet.

1084
01:32:08,535 --> 01:32:10,673
I've been here before.

1085
01:32:10,742 --> 01:32:12,946
- This way.
- Move.

1086
01:32:27,479 --> 01:32:29,420
You've got 20 minutes.

1087
01:32:39,542 --> 01:32:41,811
It's just like in my dream.

1088
01:32:45,815 --> 01:32:47,724
Good morning.
Can I help you?

1089
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:52,242
Well, actually, we wanted
to speak to Mr. Duvernois.

1090
01:32:54,103 --> 01:32:55,890
He's my son.

1091
01:32:58,103 --> 01:32:59,859
He's very shy.

1092
01:33:02,167 --> 01:33:04,306
Mr. Duvernois isn't here
right now.

1093
01:33:04,375 --> 01:33:07,670
But, first of all, do you know
what cryonization is?

1094
01:33:07,767 --> 01:33:09,425
Well, more or less.

1095
01:33:09,495 --> 01:33:13,292
Here are some leaflets.
You can read them while you're waiting.

1096
01:33:13,399 --> 01:33:16,148
One of my colleagues
will be with you soon.

1097
01:33:16,215 --> 01:33:17,262
Thank you.

1098
01:33:17,334 --> 01:33:21,196
''Live without limits.
Tomorrow is for the foresighted.''

1099
01:33:21,303 --> 01:33:23,125
What is this?
Some kind of sect?

1100
01:33:23,223 --> 01:33:27,478
''Cryonization is the biostasis
or preservation of human beings.

1101
01:33:27,542 --> 01:33:30,804
It is the bridge to carry
our patients to a future...

1102
01:33:30,903 --> 01:33:33,805
when technology
will restore them to life.''

1103
01:33:37,399 --> 01:33:39,538
You pay to live eternally.

1104
01:33:42,423 --> 01:33:44,114
They laughed at Jules Verne.

1105
01:33:44,183 --> 01:33:47,695
Csar, all this
is absolutely impossible.

1106
01:33:47,798 --> 01:33:49,687
What do you know
of the future?

1107
01:33:49,783 --> 01:33:53,264
They promise what the Church
has always promised.

1108
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:55,638
Immortality.
Except they're quacks, not priests.

1109
01:33:55,704 --> 01:33:57,678
How are you involved?

1110
01:33:57,783 --> 01:34:00,117
You're not cryonized.
You're alive.

1111
01:34:00,183 --> 01:34:02,965
This is the contract,
if you want to look at it.

1112
01:34:04,439 --> 01:34:07,123
The procedure is very simple.
You could die at any time.

1113
01:34:07,223 --> 01:34:09,940
Today, tomorrow, in 20 years.
It doesn't matter to us.

1114
01:34:10,039 --> 01:34:13,454
At the very moment
you're declared legally dead...

1115
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:17,302
Life Extension transfers your body
to our store in Arizona.

1116
01:34:17,399 --> 01:34:19,788
There, it's frozen
at minus 7 8 degrees.

1117
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:23,541
We call that ''total suspension,''
and it costs $240,000.

1118
01:34:23,639 --> 01:34:26,835
30,000 pays for the freezing process,
and the rest...

1119
01:34:26,903 --> 01:34:28,877
goes into
an investment fund...

1120
01:34:28,983 --> 01:34:31,536
the interests from which
pay for maintenance...

1121
01:34:31,639 --> 01:34:34,639
and resurrection costs,
the day that it's possible.

1122
01:34:34,743 --> 01:34:36,466
If it is possible.

1123
01:34:36,535 --> 01:34:40,594
We believe that the reanimation
of the dead will be possible.

1124
01:34:40,663 --> 01:34:42,572
- What's this?
- What?

1125
01:34:42,678 --> 01:34:44,981
Clause 1 4.
Artificial perception.

1126
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:49,357
It's a concept that we haven't
fully developed yet.

1127
01:34:49,464 --> 01:34:52,017
Look. This is a life.

1128
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:53,942
Birth and death.

1129
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,941
Let's say you've got
a terminal illness.

1130
01:34:57,047 --> 01:35:00,724
Of course you want to go on living,
but not in the future.

1131
01:35:00,823 --> 01:35:04,947
That doesn't interest you.
You want to live your life now.

1132
01:35:05,015 --> 01:35:08,114
Very well.
You die, we freeze you...

1133
01:35:08,183 --> 01:35:12,461
and when we can resuscitate you,
we'll have you live...

1134
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:14,418
a dream.

1135
01:35:15,864 --> 01:35:18,417
- A dream?
- It will all look real.

1136
01:35:18,519 --> 01:35:20,624
Your family and friends,
your city...

1137
01:35:20,695 --> 01:35:22,551
the world, even this office.

1138
01:35:22,648 --> 01:35:24,503
But it'll be a virtual reality.

1139
01:35:24,601 --> 01:35:28,145
What's more, we'll make you forget
that you've died...

1140
01:35:28,215 --> 01:35:30,070
and that you signed
this contract.

1141
01:35:30,136 --> 01:35:31,860
- How?
- Very simple.

1142
01:35:31,961 --> 01:35:33,903
Wiping it from your memory.

1143
01:35:33,977 --> 01:35:36,725
You'll live your life linearly,
as if nothing had happened.

1144
01:35:36,824 --> 01:35:40,436
And best of all, you'll live it
as you like, as you wish.

1145
01:35:40,503 --> 01:35:42,871
You'll decide at all times.

1146
01:35:42,936 --> 01:35:46,711
But what if there were mistakes?

1147
01:35:46,776 --> 01:35:50,224
What if the dream
was transformed into a nightmare?

1148
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:53,230
Well, the subconscious
can always play a dirty trick.

1149
01:35:53,304 --> 01:35:56,719
But we're not cowboys.
This is a serious company.

1150
01:35:56,825 --> 01:36:00,980
And virtual reality technology
is constantly making huge advances.

1151
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:03,022
Look.

1152
01:36:03,128 --> 01:36:04,786
I'll be honest.

1153
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:08,783
Signing Clause 1 4
is like signing for paradise.

1154
01:36:09,848 --> 01:36:15,216
It's hard to believe.
But they laughed at Jules Verne.

1155
01:36:19,864 --> 01:36:20,879
Excuse me.

1156
01:36:25,689 --> 01:36:28,406
- Where are you going so fast?
- To the bathroom.

1157
01:36:28,505 --> 01:36:31,025
- Well, not so fast.
- I'll go with him.

1158
01:36:31,128 --> 01:36:33,463
He just felt ill, don't worry.

1159
01:36:39,256 --> 01:36:41,144
Csar, calm down, please.

1160
01:36:41,241 --> 01:36:43,510
This is a dream.
It's the only explanation.

1161
01:36:43,609 --> 01:36:45,518
What he said is impossible.

1162
01:36:45,625 --> 01:36:47,861
In the 20th century,
but maybe not in the 30th.

1163
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:51,223
- Maybe not, but we're in 1 99 7.
- That's what it seems.

1164
01:36:51,321 --> 01:36:54,169
- I paid for it to seem like that.
- Listen! If this is a dream--

1165
01:36:54,265 --> 01:36:58,258
Look at me! If this is a dream,
it means that I don't exist!

1166
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,597
- I just imagine you.
- No!

1167
01:37:00,664 --> 01:37:03,980
- Csar, I'm real.
- How do I know that?

1168
01:37:04,056 --> 01:37:07,853
Can't you tell a dream from reality?
Is this a dream, eh?

1169
01:37:07,962 --> 01:37:10,230
Tell me, is this a dream?

1170
01:37:12,730 --> 01:37:15,184
Csar, I'm wearing myself out
over this case.

1171
01:37:15,257 --> 01:37:18,705
There is no case. I didn't kill anyone.
It's all a nightmare.

1172
01:37:18,777 --> 01:37:22,225
Fuck it, Csar, trust me!
This isn't a dream.

1173
01:37:22,329 --> 01:37:24,151
- They got it wrong.
- Who?

1174
01:37:24,249 --> 01:37:28,918
I don't know! But they mixed up Sofia
and Nuria! I see a face that isn't mine.

1175
01:37:28,984 --> 01:37:31,703
I'm sick of hearing that!
Your face is fine.

1176
01:37:31,801 --> 01:37:35,117
You're behaving like a child,
hiding behind that mask.

1177
01:37:35,224 --> 01:37:38,039
- Go on, take it off!
- I don't want to see myself!

1178
01:37:38,103 --> 01:37:40,471
I don't care about that.
I want to see you.

1179
01:37:40,569 --> 01:37:44,595
Don't you realize? All that matters
is what I see! It's my dream!

1180
01:37:44,664 --> 01:37:49,104
Say that once more and
I'll have you locked up in an asylum.

1181
01:37:49,209 --> 01:37:52,952
Show me your face.
Now. You owe it to me.

1182
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:17,139
Csar, look in the mirror and tell me
if you think you're disfigured.

1183
01:38:21,625 --> 01:38:22,639
God!

1184
01:38:22,746 --> 01:38:25,047
Why do you keep seeing
what isn't there?

1185
01:38:25,145 --> 01:38:27,217
- You look fine.
- I'm a monster!

1186
01:38:27,321 --> 01:38:30,704
What do you mean?
Anybody'd like to have your face.

1187
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:32,468
You look normal.

1188
01:38:32,538 --> 01:38:35,189
Not just normal.
You're handsome!

1189
01:38:36,345 --> 01:38:40,120
Csar, listen. Maybe you've got
something like anorexia.

1190
01:38:40,185 --> 01:38:43,481
Some girls insist they're fat
and end up crazy.

1191
01:38:43,545 --> 01:38:44,560
Csar!

1192
01:38:46,458 --> 01:38:48,465
I want to wake up!

1193
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:51,123
I want to wake up!

1194
01:38:51,225 --> 01:38:53,975
- Hold it!
- I want to wake up!

1195
01:38:54,106 --> 01:38:55,415
Fuck!

1196
01:38:56,282 --> 01:38:57,427
Shit!

1197
01:38:57,529 --> 01:39:00,049
- Freeze!
- Don't shoot!

1198
01:39:01,178 --> 01:39:04,342
This is a nightmare!
It's a nightmare!

1199
01:39:15,738 --> 01:39:19,632
You! Wait a minute!
You're not to leave!

1200
01:39:19,705 --> 01:39:21,112
Stop!

1201
01:39:29,785 --> 01:39:32,241
Wait a minute!

1202
01:39:47,226 --> 01:39:48,600
It's a dream!

1203
01:39:48,666 --> 01:39:50,869
It's a dream!

1204
01:40:06,843 --> 01:40:11,600
Don't move!
Drop the gun!

1205
01:40:13,882 --> 01:40:16,915
- I want to wake up. I want to wake up.
- Don't move!

1206
01:40:16,986 --> 01:40:20,335
I want to wake up!

1207
01:40:30,618 --> 01:40:32,308
Antonio.

1208
01:40:34,138 --> 01:40:35,512
Antonio!

1209
01:40:36,827 --> 01:40:38,649
What?

1210
01:40:38,747 --> 01:40:40,786
You're crushing me.

1211
01:40:42,010 --> 01:40:45,905
I'd better not move.
I've been shot in the back.

1212
01:40:47,098 --> 01:40:49,138
How do you know?

1213
01:40:50,266 --> 01:40:52,754
Well...

1214
01:40:52,826 --> 01:40:54,169
because--

1215
01:41:07,418 --> 01:41:10,069
What's going on here?

1216
01:41:10,138 --> 01:41:12,146
What the fuck's going on?

1217
01:41:12,251 --> 01:41:13,975
I told you, it's a dream.

1218
01:41:14,107 --> 01:41:16,245
Shut up! Shut up!

1219
01:41:18,171 --> 01:41:22,099
I know what this is.
It's one of those Candid Camera jokes.

1220
01:41:22,939 --> 01:41:25,873
You did a great job, I loved it,
but enough's enough!

1221
01:41:25,947 --> 01:41:28,314
- I see someone.
- Where?

1222
01:41:28,411 --> 01:41:30,384
Up there, on the roof.

1223
01:41:30,490 --> 01:41:32,662
I can't see a thing.

1224
01:41:33,498 --> 01:41:35,671
Where are you going?

1225
01:41:37,883 --> 01:41:42,225
Come on, Antonio. Don't think
about it anymore or you'll go crazy.

1226
01:41:57,787 --> 01:41:59,348
Hello, Csar.

1227
01:42:01,147 --> 01:42:03,056
It's time I introduced myself.

1228
01:42:03,163 --> 01:42:06,675
My name is Serge Duvernois.
I represent Life Extension.

1229
01:42:06,746 --> 01:42:08,088
We met...

1230
01:42:09,243 --> 01:42:10,585
1 50 years ago.

1231
01:42:10,684 --> 01:42:13,270
What? Has the world gone mad?

1232
01:42:13,371 --> 01:42:16,917
There's no world.
It's all in that gentleman's mind.

1233
01:42:16,988 --> 01:42:18,843
Including you and me.

1234
01:42:18,907 --> 01:42:21,590
Sure! Shall I thump you
to see if it hurts?

1235
01:42:21,691 --> 01:42:26,580
Try it. They can make you disappear
right now, like everyone else.

1236
01:42:26,683 --> 01:42:29,433
- And who are ''they,'' may I ask?
- The company.

1237
01:42:29,532 --> 01:42:31,768
Life Extension.

1238
01:42:31,867 --> 01:42:34,169
They know everything
we're saying.

1239
01:42:34,268 --> 01:42:39,702
They know what is going through Csar's
mind an instant after he thinks it.

1240
01:42:39,803 --> 01:42:43,185
If they can make me disappear,
why haven't they done it?

1241
01:42:43,291 --> 01:42:45,200
It would be virtually incorrect.

1242
01:42:45,307 --> 01:42:47,347
You've just saved his life.

1243
01:42:47,451 --> 01:42:50,866
Virtually incorrect?
Do you think I'm an idiot or what?

1244
01:42:50,971 --> 01:42:54,354
No, quite the opposite.
You're a great guy.

1245
01:42:54,427 --> 01:42:57,144
A character who is
very necessary for Csar.

1246
01:42:58,139 --> 01:42:59,830
A character?

1247
01:43:00,987 --> 01:43:02,809
- Where are you going?
- To look for someone.

1248
01:43:02,907 --> 01:43:06,289
There is no one.
People aren't necessary now.

1249
01:43:13,788 --> 01:43:15,729
Why didn't you wake me before?

1250
01:43:16,828 --> 01:43:20,242
You only had to ask.
But that was difficult.

1251
01:43:20,347 --> 01:43:24,144
Because, in theory,
you wouldn't know you were dreaming.

1252
01:43:24,252 --> 01:43:25,910
Since when?

1253
01:43:26,012 --> 01:43:27,986
Remember the day
of the discotheque?

1254
01:43:28,092 --> 01:43:31,769
That night, when you fell asleep
on the sidewalk...

1255
01:43:31,868 --> 01:43:34,235
was the one chosen
for the splice.

1256
01:43:34,332 --> 01:43:35,859
What splice?

1257
01:43:35,964 --> 01:43:39,313
The splice between your real life
and your virtual life.

1258
01:43:39,388 --> 01:43:42,835
A splice of 1 50 years
which you didn't notice...

1259
01:43:42,907 --> 01:43:46,169
because you were dead
and frozen.

1260
01:43:46,267 --> 01:43:48,178
From when you woke up...

1261
01:43:48,284 --> 01:43:50,389
nothing was real.

1262
01:43:50,491 --> 01:43:53,491
We wiped what really happened
from your memory.

1263
01:43:54,748 --> 01:43:57,236
What was it?

1264
01:43:57,308 --> 01:43:59,674
You never saw Sofia again.

1265
01:43:59,772 --> 01:44:02,935
And the doctors were never able
to rebuild your face.

1266
01:44:04,059 --> 01:44:08,152
You woke up on that street
with an awful hangover.

1267
01:44:08,252 --> 01:44:10,488
You shut yourself away
for months.

1268
01:44:10,587 --> 01:44:12,497
One day you learned
that we eisted.

1269
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:16,816
You came to the office,
you signed the contract...

1270
01:44:16,923 --> 01:44:19,063
and then...

1271
01:44:19,165 --> 01:44:21,052
you killed yourself.

1272
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:24,216
I paid for this?

1273
01:44:25,212 --> 01:44:28,594
I paid for Nuria
to come back as Sofia?

1274
01:44:28,668 --> 01:44:30,840
I paid to look like
a monster again?

1275
01:44:30,908 --> 01:44:32,795
I paid to live this nightmare?

1276
01:44:32,892 --> 01:44:35,510
You paid to live
whatever you wanted.

1277
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:37,752
We just provided the setting
and the characters.

1278
01:44:37,852 --> 01:44:40,154
You invented your hell.

1279
01:44:40,252 --> 01:44:42,837
I tried to warn you
in that bar.

1280
01:44:42,909 --> 01:44:44,948
I said it all depended
on your mind.

1281
01:44:45,819 --> 01:44:48,634
Do I just have to want it?

1282
01:44:48,732 --> 01:44:51,253
- Can Antonio come--
- There's no one here.

1283
01:44:52,124 --> 01:44:55,191
They can't have made
4 million people disappear!

1284
01:44:56,413 --> 01:44:58,388
You've overcome your fears.

1285
01:44:58,493 --> 01:45:00,467
If you want,
we can try again...

1286
01:45:00,572 --> 01:45:02,644
have you live
a wonderful dream...

1287
01:45:02,748 --> 01:45:06,326
with money, friends, Sofia,
or whatever girl you want.

1288
01:45:06,428 --> 01:45:08,794
You just have to ask.

1289
01:45:10,589 --> 01:45:12,443
I don't want more dreams.

1290
01:45:12,509 --> 01:45:14,483
It isn't a dream!

1291
01:45:14,588 --> 01:45:16,410
Csar, listen to me.

1292
01:45:16,509 --> 01:45:18,898
This is real.
This man is a sham.

1293
01:45:19,005 --> 01:45:21,426
Let's go down
and look for people.

1294
01:45:21,501 --> 01:45:24,118
Ignore him. It's logical
for him to behave like this...

1295
01:45:24,188 --> 01:45:26,577
but he doesn't
feel anything.

1296
01:45:26,684 --> 01:45:28,823
I don't feel anything?

1297
01:45:28,924 --> 01:45:32,307
I don't feel anything?
What do you know about what I feel?

1298
01:45:32,412 --> 01:45:34,038
Ignore him, he isn't real.

1299
01:45:34,108 --> 01:45:36,661
Yes, I am real!

1300
01:45:36,765 --> 01:45:38,904
I've got a wife
and two daughters.

1301
01:45:39,005 --> 01:45:42,802
His personality is designed
so that he'll say all this now.

1302
01:45:42,908 --> 01:45:45,756
Where are my daughters?
God!

1303
01:45:45,821 --> 01:45:48,756
Csar, we can offer you
another possibility.

1304
01:45:48,829 --> 01:45:51,928
In 1 99 7, it was impossible
to rebuild your face.

1305
01:45:52,029 --> 01:45:55,509
But out there,
it's the year 2 1 45.

1306
01:45:55,613 --> 01:45:58,809
You wouldn't believe
the things surgery can do.

1307
01:45:58,909 --> 01:46:01,146
You could wake up...

1308
01:46:01,245 --> 01:46:03,961
and live in the future
like a normal person.

1309
01:46:04,028 --> 01:46:07,062
- In the future?
- You have to choose.

1310
01:46:09,949 --> 01:46:11,804
How could I wake up?

1311
01:46:11,869 --> 01:46:15,894
How would you wake
from your worst nightmare?

1312
01:46:21,790 --> 01:46:23,643
No, Csar, don't listen to him!

1313
01:46:23,709 --> 01:46:26,873
Your partners set this up!
They want you to kill yourself!

1314
01:46:26,941 --> 01:46:30,290
He's done that.
Now it'll just be a formality.

1315
01:46:31,612 --> 01:46:34,002
- I'm going to do it.
- Very well.

1316
01:46:35,293 --> 01:46:39,287
Do you have any wish
before you die?

1317
01:46:52,989 --> 01:46:55,541
Let them out there read my mind.

1318
01:47:56,991 --> 01:47:58,332
Who are you?

1319
01:47:59,581 --> 01:48:01,108
I don't know.

1320
01:48:01,213 --> 01:48:04,562
Don't keep suffering.
It's all in your head.

1321
01:48:04,670 --> 01:48:07,037
It's all psychological.

1322
01:48:32,126 --> 01:48:33,948
Come on, Csar.

1323
01:48:47,166 --> 01:48:50,331
- What will happen to them?
- Don't prolong this farewell.

1324
01:48:50,430 --> 01:48:53,779
You think they're your friends,
but they're just images.

1325
01:48:53,887 --> 01:48:55,828
That man isn't really crying.

1326
01:49:18,366 --> 01:49:22,229
- I forgot, I get vertigo.
- Then don't look.

1327
01:49:24,351 --> 01:49:25,812
Good-bye, Csar.

1328
01:50:07,647 --> 01:50:08,988
Relax.

1329
01:50:11,166 --> 01:50:12,508
Relax.

1330
01:50:14,975 --> 01:50:16,862
Open your eyes.
