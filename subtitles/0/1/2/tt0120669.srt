[ Woman ][br]~ Raindrops on roses ~

00:00:36.30,00:00:39.24
~ And whiskers on kittens ~

00:00:40.31,00:00:42.40
~ Bright copper kettles ~

00:00:42.48,00:00:45.93
~ And warm woolen mittens ~

00:00:47.01,00:00:48.81
~ Brown paper packages ~

00:00:48.88,00:00:52.18
~ Tied up with string ~

00:00:52.25,00:00:54.88
~ These are a few ~

00:00:54.95,00:01:00.86
~ Of my favorite things ~

00:01:03.33,00:01:06.77
[ Duke Narrating ][br]We were somewhere around[br]Barstow, on the edge of the desert...

00:01:06.83,00:01:09.27
when the drugs[br]began to take hold.

00:01:21.51,00:01:24.45
[ Duke ][br]I remember saying something like:

00:01:24.52,00:01:27.95
I feel a bit lightheaded.[br]Maybe you should drive.

00:01:28.02,00:01:30.61
~ [ Continues ]

00:01:30.69,00:01:34.13
- Hmm ?[br]- Suddenly there was[br]a terrible roar all around us...

00:01:34.19,00:01:37.13
and the sky was full of[br]what looked like huge bats...

00:01:37.20,00:01:40.13
- [ Bats Screeching ][br]- all swooping and screeching[br]and diving around the car.

00:01:40.20,00:01:43.19
- And a voice was screaming:[br]- Holy Jesus, what are[br]these goddamned animals ?

00:01:43.27,00:01:47.23
- [ Grunting ][br]- [ Rock Continues ][br]~ Come on, baby ~

00:01:47.31,00:01:49.74
- Did you say something ?[br]- Hmm ?

00:01:49.81,00:01:51.74
Never mind.

00:01:51.81,00:01:53.74
It's your turn to drive.

00:01:53.81,00:01:56.75
No point in mentioning[br]these bats, I thought.

00:01:56.82,00:01:59.68
The poor bastard'll[br]see them soon enough.

00:01:59.75,00:02:01.69
~ Baby, I'm startin'[br]to feel human ~

00:02:01.75,00:02:04.31
- ~ Ohh, ohh, yeah ~[br]- ~ Hey, hey, Feel with me, baby ~

00:02:04.39,00:02:07.26
- [ Grunting ][br]- ~ 'Cause I feel it comin' on ~

00:02:07.33,00:02:09.76
~ [ Continues ]

00:02:09.83,00:02:12.49
- [ Screeching Continues ][br]- Fucking pigs ! Flying !

00:02:12.57,00:02:15.50
[ Grunting, Murmuring ]

00:02:15.57,00:02:17.56
We had two bags of grass...

00:02:17.64,00:02:19.57
75 pellets of mescaline...

00:02:19.64,00:02:22.66
five sheets of[br]high-powered blotter acid...

00:02:22.74,00:02:25.23
a salt shaker[br]half-full of cocaine...

00:02:25.31,00:02:28.51
a whole galaxy of multicolored[br]uppers, downers, screamers, laughers.

00:02:28.58,00:02:32.52
Also a quart of tequila,[br]a quart of rum, a case of beer...

00:02:32.59,00:02:34.52
- a pint of raw ether...[br]- Shit !

00:02:34.59,00:02:36.52
two dozen amyls.

00:02:36.59,00:02:38.78
Not that we needed all that[br]for the trip...

00:02:38.86,00:02:41.79
but once you get locked into[br]a serious drug collection...

00:02:41.86,00:02:44.35
the tendency is to push it[br]as far as you can.

00:02:45.73,00:02:48.67
The only thing that really[br]worried me was the ether.

00:02:48.73,00:02:52.00
There is nothing in the world[br]more helpless and irresponsible[br]and depraved...

00:02:52.07,00:02:55.01
than a man in the depths[br]of an ether binge...

00:02:55.07,00:02:58.01
and I knew we'd get into[br]that rotten stuff pretty soon.

00:03:00.41,00:03:01.34
[ Radio: Female Newscaster ][br]A House subcommittee report[br]says illegal drugs killed...

00:03:01.41,00:03:04.28
160 American G.I.s[br]last year...

00:03:04.35,00:03:06.55
40 of them in Vietnam.

00:03:07.52,00:03:08.78
- [ Tuning ][br]- ~ One toke over the line[br]Sweet Jesus ~

00:03:08.85,00:03:10.79
One toke, man !

00:03:10.86,00:03:14.02
[ Singing Along With Radio,[br]Slightly Behind ][br]~ One toke over the line ~

00:03:14.09,00:03:17.29
~ Sittin' downtown[br]at a railway station ~

00:03:17.36,00:03:20.13
~ One toke over the line ~

00:03:20.20,00:03:22.76
- One toke, you poor fool ?[br]- ~ Sweet, sweet Mary ~

00:03:22.84,00:03:25.63
Wait'll you see[br]those goddamned bats, man.

00:03:25.70,00:03:27.67
~ Mine ~

00:03:27.74,00:03:30.40
[ Radio Continues ][br]~ One toke over the line ~

00:03:32.14,00:03:35.74
- Let's give that boy a lift.[br]- What ? No !

00:03:35.81,00:03:37.75
- ~ [ Ends ][br]- Wait !

00:03:37.82,00:03:40.55
We can't stop here.[br]This is bat country.

00:03:44.02,00:03:47.96
Hot damn ! I never rode[br]in a convertible before !

00:03:48.03,00:03:51.49
Is that right ? Well, I guess[br]you're about ready then, aren't ya ?

00:03:51.56,00:03:55.00
We're your friends. We're not[br]like the others, man. Really.

00:03:55.07,00:03:58.04
No more of that talk, or I'll[br]put the leeches on you. Understand ?

00:03:58.10,00:03:59.70
[ Gonzo Giggling ]

00:04:00.77,00:04:02.37
Get in.

00:04:05.94,00:04:09.28
How long could we maintain,[br]I wondered.

00:04:09.35,00:04:12.94
How long before one of us starts raving[br]and jabbering at this boy ?

00:04:13.02,00:04:14.95
What will he think then ?

00:04:15.02,00:04:19.18
This same lonely desert was the last[br]known home of the Manson family.

00:04:19.26,00:04:22.66
Would he make that grim connection[br]when my attorney starts screaming...

00:04:22.73,00:04:25.66
about bats and huge manta rays[br]coming down on the car ?

00:04:25.73,00:04:29.53
If so, well, we'll just have to[br]cut his head off and bury him somewhere.

00:04:29.60,00:04:33.04
- 'Cause it goes without saying[br]that we can't turn him loose.[br]- [ Muttering ]

00:04:33.11,00:04:36.54
He'd report us at once to some kind of[br]outback nazi law enforcement agency...

00:04:36.61,00:04:39.04
and they'll run us down[br]like dogs.

00:04:39.11,00:04:43.05
- Jesus, did I say that,[br]or just think it ?[br]- Jesus, did I say that ?

00:04:43.12,00:04:45.55
Was I talking ?[br]Did they hear me ?

00:04:45.62,00:04:48.92
It's okay. Just admiring[br]the shape of your skull.

00:04:48.99,00:04:51.92
- No, thanks ![br]- Maybe I'd better have[br]a chat with this boy.

00:04:51.99,00:04:54.93
- I have asthma ![br]- Perhaps if I explain things,[br]he'll rest easy.

00:04:54.99,00:04:56.93
All right, listen.

00:04:57.00,00:05:00.69
There's one thing you should probably[br]understand-- Can you hear me ?

00:05:00.77,00:05:02.63
Good.

00:05:02.70,00:05:05.64
I want you to have[br]all the background.

00:05:05.70,00:05:08.14
- Aah ![br]- This is a very ominous assignment...

00:05:08.21,00:05:10.14
with overtones of[br]extreme personal danger.

00:05:10.21,00:05:12.94
I'm a Doctor of Journalism.[br]This is important, goddamn it !

00:05:13.01,00:05:15.34
- This is a fucking true story ![br]- [ Gasps ]

00:05:15.41,00:05:17.54
[ Gonzo Shouting ][br]You fucking--

00:05:17.62,00:05:20.21
- Get your hands off my fucking head ![br]- [ Grunting ]

00:05:20.29,00:05:24.24
- Now, now, now.[br]- Our vibrations were[br]getting nasty. But why ?

00:05:24.32,00:05:26.76
Was there no communication[br]in this car ?

00:05:26.83,00:05:29.76
- Had we deteriorated[br]to the level of dumb beasts ?[br]- [ Giggling ]

00:05:29.83,00:05:32.26
This man at the wheel[br]is my attorney.

00:05:32.33,00:05:35.77
He's not just some dingbat I found on[br]the Strip, man. He's a foreigner.

00:05:35.83,00:05:39.46
I think he's probably Samoan.[br]It doesn't matter, though, does it ?

00:05:39.54,00:05:41.97
- Are you prejudiced ?[br]- [ Whimpers ] Hell, no.

00:05:42.04,00:05:43.97
I didn't think so.

00:05:44.04,00:05:47.48
Because, in spite of his race,[br]the man is extremely valuable to me.

00:05:47.55,00:05:50.98
- Oh, shit. I forgot about the beer.[br]You want some ?[br]- No.

00:05:51.05,00:05:53.21
- How 'bout some ether ?[br]- What ?

00:05:55.39,00:05:56.22
Never mind. All right, let's get right[br]to the heart of this thing.

00:05:56.29,00:05:57.48
- Twenty-four hours ago[br]we were sitting...[br]- ...in the Pogo Lounge...

00:05:59.28,00:06:03.38
of the Beverly Heights Hotel,[br]in the patio section, of course...

00:06:03.45,00:06:06.91
drinking Singapore Slings[br]with mescal on the side...

00:06:06.99,00:06:12.90
hiding from the brutish realities[br]of this foul year of our Lord, 1971.

00:06:12.96,00:06:15.90
[ Muttering ][br]Cops were goin' apeshit--

00:06:15.97,00:06:21.00
Perhaps this is the call you've[br]been waiting for all this time, sir.

00:06:21.07,00:06:23.01
Perhaps.

00:06:23.07,00:06:25.70
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

00:06:25.78,00:06:27.71
Mmm ! Really. All right.

00:06:27.78,00:06:30.27
Yeah ? Oh, yeah, yeah.[br]Oh, yeah.

00:06:30.35,00:06:31.78
Okay. Bye.

00:06:31.85,00:06:34.04
- That was headquarters.[br]They want me to--[br]- Ahem.

00:06:36.79,00:06:38.72
[ Coins Clatter On Ground ]

00:06:38.79,00:06:40.72
[ Whispers ][br]Thank you.

00:06:41.96,00:06:44.90
They want me to go[br]to Las Vegas at once...

00:06:44.96,00:06:47.90
make contact with a Portuguese[br]photographer named Lacerda.

00:06:47.97,00:06:49.90
He'll have[br]all the details.

00:06:49.97,00:06:53.40
All I have to do is check into my[br]soundproof suite. He'll seek me out.

00:06:53.47,00:06:56.20
- What do you think ?[br]- Sounds like real trouble.

00:06:56.27,00:06:59.21
You're gonna need plenty of legal[br]advice before this thing is over.

00:06:59.28,00:07:01.21
Oh, yeah.

00:07:01.28,00:07:04.44
As your attorney, I advise you to rent[br]a fast car with no top.

00:07:04.52,00:07:06.45
And you'll need[br]the cocaine.

00:07:06.52,00:07:09.92
Tape recorder[br]for special music.

00:07:09.99,00:07:11.92
Acapulco shirts.

00:07:11.99,00:07:15.65
Get the hell out of L.A.[br]for at least 48 hours.

00:07:15.73,00:07:17.66
- Blows my weekend.[br]- Why ?

00:07:17.73,00:07:21.67
'Cause, naturally, I'm[br]gonna have to go with you.

00:07:21.73,00:07:24.79
We're gonna have to[br]arm ourselves to the teeth.

00:07:24.87,00:07:27.30
Well, why not ?

00:07:27.37,00:07:31.10
I mean, if a thing's worth doing,[br]it's worth doing right.

00:07:32.38,00:07:34.90
This is the American Dream[br]in action.

00:07:35.98,00:07:37.54
Wait !

00:07:39.38,00:07:43.88
Shit, we'd be fools not to[br]ride this strange torpedo[br]all the way out to the end.

00:07:43.96,00:07:45.89
Indeed.[br]We must do it.

00:07:45.96,00:07:47.95
What kind of story[br]is this ?

00:07:48.03,00:07:49.96
It's the Mint 400...

00:07:50.03,00:07:54.02
the richest off-road race for[br]motorcycles and dune buggies in[br]the history of organized sport.

00:07:54.10,00:07:56.03
It's a fantastic[br]spectacle...

00:07:56.10,00:07:58.03
in honor of some[br]fatback grosero...

00:07:58.10,00:08:01.04
who owns the luxurious Mint Hotel[br]in downtown Las Vegas.

00:08:01.11,00:08:03.47
At least that's what[br]the press release says.

00:08:03.54,00:08:05.98
As your attorney,[br]I advise you to buy a motorcycle.

00:08:06.04,00:08:09.48
How else can you cover[br]a thing like this righteously ?

00:08:09.55,00:08:12.98
Well, we're gonna have to[br]drum it up on our own.

00:08:13.05,00:08:14.99
Pure Gonzo journalism.

00:08:15.05,00:08:16.99
[ Tires Screeching ]

00:08:17.06,00:08:19.62
Shit !

00:08:19.69,00:08:21.63
[ Tires Screech ]

00:08:24.93,00:08:28.37
[ Duke ] Getting hold of the drugs[br]and shirts had been no problem...

00:08:28.43,00:08:31.37
but the car and tape recorder were[br]not easy things to round up at 6:30...

00:08:31.44,00:08:33.87
on a Friday afternoon[br]in Hollywood.

00:08:33.94,00:08:36.84
Sounds beautiful.[br]Great. Hang on to it.

00:08:36.91,00:08:39.84
Fuckin' A, the gentleman has[br]a major credit card !

00:08:39.91,00:08:43.14
That's right, man. Don't take any guff[br]from these fucking swine.

00:08:43.21,00:08:45.15
I just got through[br]saying that.

00:08:45.22,00:08:49.48
Do you realize who the fuck[br]you're talking to ? Do you ?

00:08:49.55,00:08:51.49
Be over in 30 minutes.

00:08:54.39,00:08:56.72
[ Duke ][br]We're gonna need a sound store.

00:08:56.79,00:08:59.73
- [ Gonzo ] We won't make the nut[br]unless we have unlimited credit.[br]- We will, man.

00:08:59.80,00:09:02.20
You Samoans[br]are all the same.

00:09:02.27,00:09:07.23
You have no faith in the essential[br]decency of the white man's culture.

00:09:07.31,00:09:09.24
[ Duke Narrating ][br]The store was closed...

00:09:09.31,00:09:12.24
but the salesman said[br]he could wait if we'd hurry.

00:09:12.31,00:09:14.24
- [ Horns Honking ][br]- [ Sirens Wailing ]

00:09:14.31,00:09:17.61
But we were delayed en route[br]when the Stingray in front of us[br]killed a pedestrian.

00:09:18.85,00:09:21.79
We had trouble again[br]with the car rental agency.

00:09:21.85,00:09:25.29
Mr. Duke, we're all settled.[br]If I could get your John[br]Hancock, you're on your way.

00:09:25.36,00:09:29.12
- Yeah.[br]- You're gonna be real careful[br]with this car, right ?

00:09:29.19,00:09:31.13
Oh, yeah, man.[br]Of course.

00:09:35.10,00:09:37.03
[ Tires Screech ]

00:09:37.10,00:09:40.04
[ Panting ][br]Holy smokes !

00:09:40.10,00:09:44.04
You just backed over[br]a 2-foot concrete abutment,[br]you didn't even slow down.

00:09:44.11,00:09:47.20
What, were you going about,[br]uh, oh, I don't know,[br]45 miles an hour backwards ?

00:59:19.33,00:59:23.85
Luckily I had taken the soap[br]and grapefruit and other luggage[br]out to the car earlier.

00:59:23.93,00:59:25.46
Now--

00:59:25.53,00:59:27.47
it was only a matter[br]of slipping the noose.

00:59:27.53,00:59:31.33
Hey ! Here, take this.[br]All right.

00:59:31.41,00:59:35.50
- Mr. Duke ! Mr. Duke ![br]- Oh, shit.

00:59:35.58,00:59:39.88
- We've been looking for you.[br]- The game was up. They had me.

00:59:39.95,00:59:43.25

00:59:43.32,00:59:45.51
- Sir ?[br]- What ?

00:59:45.59,00:59:47.68
Um, this telegram[br]came for you.

00:59:47.76,00:59:50.75
Actually, it's not for you.[br]It's for somebody named, uh, Thompson.

00:59:50.82,00:59:54.19
But it says, "Care of Raoul Duke."[br]Do you-- Do you--

00:59:54.26,00:59:57.25
- Does that mean anything ?[br]- Yes, yes, it means a lot. Thanks.

00:59:57.33,01:00:00.77
- Yeah, I checked the register[br]for this man Thompson.[br]- [ Engine Revs ]

01:00:00.83,01:00:03.39
We don't show him, but I figured[br]he might be part of your team.

01:00:03.47,01:00:05.50
-He is. Don't worry. I'll get it to him.[br]-Yeah.

01:00:05.57,01:00:08.20
Um, what confused us[br]was, uh...

01:00:08.28,01:00:12.71
Dr. Gonzo's signature[br]on the telegram from Los Angeles[br]when we knew he was right here.

01:00:12.78,01:00:14.91
Right.[br]You did the right thing.

01:00:14.98,01:00:18.32
Never try to understand a press message.[br]About half the time, we use codes.

01:00:18.39,01:00:20.68
Especially with Dr. Gonzo.[br]See ya.

- Um, tell me.[br]- [ Tires Screech ]

01:00:24.69,01:00:27.25

01:00:27.33,01:00:31.32
- Awake ? What do you mean ?[br]- Well, um...

01:00:31.40,01:00:35.06
my manager, Mr. Heem,[br]would like to meet him.

01:00:35.14,01:00:37.63
It's nothing unusual, um--

01:00:37.70,01:00:41.73
Mr. Heem likes to meet[br]all of our large accounts...

01:00:41.81,01:00:44.07

01:00:44.14,01:00:46.34
Just a chat and a handshake.[br]You understand.

01:00:46.41,01:00:48.35
Of course,[br]but if I were you...

01:00:48.42,01:00:50.82
I would leave the doctor alone[br]until after he's eaten his breakfast...

01:00:50.88,01:00:52.82
because he's[br]a very crude man.

01:00:52.89,01:00:55.35
Jesus God !

01:00:55.42,01:00:57.91
- No ![br]- [ Tires Screech ]

01:00:57.99,01:01:02.76
But he will be available,[br]huh, maybe later this morning ?

01:01:02.83,01:01:06.86
Look, the telegram[br]is actually all scrambled.

01:01:06.93,01:01:09.90
It's actually from Thompson,[br]not to him.

01:01:09.97,01:01:13.63
All right ? Now, I've got to go.[br]I've gotta get to the race.

01:01:13.71,01:01:16.44
- B-But there's no hurry.[br]The race is over.[br]- Not for me.

Good morning. How are you ?[br]All right, man. Doing very well.

01:02:25.51,01:02:27.57
Few people understand the psychology[br]of dealing with a highway traffic cop.

01:02:27.65,01:02:32.18
Your normal speeder will panic[br]and immediately pull over to the side.

01:02:32.25,01:02:35.24
This is wrong.[br]It arouses contempt in the cop heart.

01:02:36.82,01:02:40.09
Make the bastard chase you.[br]He will follow.

01:02:40.16,01:02:43.89
But he won't know what to make[br]of your blinker signal that says[br]you're about to turn right.

01:02:43.96,01:02:48.73
This is to let him know you're[br]pulling off for a proper place to talk.

01:02:48.80,01:02:51.05
It'll take him a moment[br]to realize he's about to make[br]a 180-degree turn, at speed.

01:02:51.05,01:02:53.41
It'll take him a moment[br]to realize he's about to make[br]a 180-degree turn, at speed.

01:02:53.48,01:02:55.68
But you will be ready.[br]Brace for the "G"s.

01:03:56.95,01:04:00.51
- You realize what you did[br]when you drive like that ?[br]- Yeah, I know. I'm guilty.

01:04:00.58,01:04:04.11
I understand that. I knew it[br]was a crime. I did it anyway.

01:04:04.19,01:04:07.16
Shit, why argue ?[br]I'm a fucking criminal. Look at me.

You know, I have a feeling[br]you need to take a nap.

01:04:16.50,01:04:18.80
There's a rest area[br]just up ahead.

01:04:18.87,01:04:22.10
I'd like you to go up there,[br]pull over and get a few hours' sleep.

01:04:22.17,01:04:24.20
That's not gonna help me.

01:04:24.27,01:04:27.47
I've been awake for too long.[br]Three or four nights, maybe.[br]Can't even remember.

I go to sleep now,[br]I'm dead for 20 hours.

01:05:18.93,01:05:20.86
It's not my jurisdiction.

01:05:20.93,01:05:24.46

that a really massive crime[br]often slips by unrecognized.

01:41:48.21,01:41:51.98
