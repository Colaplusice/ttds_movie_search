Resinkronyze by Budi212121[br]to Bluray 720p

00:03:36.34,00:03:38.47
You're sweating.

00:03:38.47,00:03:41.44
I know. I'm excited though.[br]I can see it all happening.

00:03:45.35,00:03:46.82
A little turn...

00:03:46.82,00:03:49.05
Now side to side.

00:03:50.62,00:03:52.25
Other people can sing.

00:04:06.60,00:04:07.97
Can we talk out here[br]for a minute?

00:04:07.97,00:04:08.97
She's fantastic.

00:04:08.97,00:04:09.91
What are you[br]talking about?

00:04:09.91,00:04:11.71
I think she sings funny.

00:04:11.71,00:04:13.94
And her dancing's not[br]all that great either.

00:04:13.94,00:04:15.77
That's the first time[br]she did it, okay?

00:04:18.58,00:04:20.75
Yeah, but I had[br]all the kits by then.

00:04:20.75,00:04:21.98
Because she didn't[br]take the kettle,

00:04:21.98,00:04:23.59
so I was stuck.

00:04:23.59,00:04:25.22
Do you want me to[br]take the kettle, Samuel?

00:04:25.22,00:04:27.09
No, I don't.[br]I just want Kathy

00:04:27.09,00:04:29.83
to put it over here.[br]This is, you know...

00:04:29.83,00:04:31.63
If you say these words,[br]and then, boom,

00:04:31.63,00:04:32.93
you just put[br]your hands out,

00:04:32.93,00:04:34.36
and there they are.[br]They're there.

00:04:38.17,00:04:40.36
Please don't[br]drop the props, Kathy.

00:04:48.31,00:04:49.51
Wait, wait.

00:04:49.51,00:04:50.91
Why are you putting it[br]on her head, though?

00:04:50.91,00:04:52.68
I'm a little confused.

00:04:52.68,00:04:54.62
I don't know.[br]It was, uh...

00:04:54.62,00:04:56.45
Because she's not[br]going to pick it up.

00:04:56.45,00:04:58.29
It looks like[br]you're trying to...

00:04:58.29,00:05:00.06
put a hat on her head[br]or something.

00:05:00.06,00:05:01.62
You're fantastic.

00:05:01.62,00:05:03.86
You just have to listen[br]to your heart, Cvalda.

00:05:03.86,00:05:05.73
I don't want you[br]to call me Cvalda.

00:05:05.73,00:05:07.16
Okay, Paul, please.

00:05:07.16,00:05:08.63
You're Cvalda[br]to me.

00:05:08.63,00:05:10.56
Let's do some sound effects.

00:05:37.39,00:05:38.63
Wait!

00:05:38.63,00:05:39.93
I told you[br]no tapping

00:05:39.93,00:05:41.26
in "The Sound[br]of Music."

00:05:41.26,00:05:43.17
It really needs rhythm.

00:05:43.17,00:05:44.53
Like drums or something.

00:05:44.53,00:05:48.90
Everybody's[br]doing a great job.

00:05:48.90,00:05:50.39
Really.

00:06:00.12,00:06:03.92
"L-T-U..."

00:06:07.72,00:06:09.32
Oh, hello, Selma.[br]Come here.

00:06:09.32,00:06:11.16
- Are you ready?[br]- Yeah, I'm ready.

00:06:11.16,00:06:13.60
Okay, you know[br]where to stand.

00:06:13.60,00:06:14.66
Yeah.

00:06:14.66,00:06:17.30
So let's try[br]this one.

00:06:17.30,00:06:20.17
"F-E-Z-T."

00:06:20.17,00:06:21.77
Maybe[br]even this one.

00:06:21.77,00:06:25.57
"T-E-F-P-O..."

00:06:25.57,00:06:28.44
I think you can work[br]that machine safely.

00:06:28.44,00:06:30.51
I'll write a note[br]to the plant

00:06:30.51,00:06:31.75
and let them know.

00:06:31.75,00:06:33.65
Thank you.

00:06:33.65,00:06:34.75
Bye.

00:06:34.75,00:06:35.95
Goodbye.

00:06:35.95,00:06:37.02
Bye.

00:06:37.02,00:06:38.08
Goodbye.

00:07:07.22,00:07:09.35
We lost five hours[br]'cause some idiot

00:07:09.35,00:07:10.48
broke the machine.

00:07:12.52,00:07:14.39
Bill's here.

00:07:14.39,00:07:16.39
So?

00:07:16.39,00:07:18.56
Well, he's here[br]with Gene.

00:07:18.56,00:07:21.43
Oh, that sounds[br]like bad news.

00:07:21.43,00:07:23.93
What are you[br]going to do?

00:07:23.93,00:07:26.92
Well, I guess I got[br]to tell her, don't i?

00:07:31.71,00:07:34.24
You can't bring[br]the script to work, Selma.

00:07:34.24,00:07:36.75
Keep your eyes[br]on the machine, okay?

00:07:36.75,00:07:38.34
Yeah.

00:07:39.38,00:07:40.85
Sure.

00:07:44.19,00:07:45.65
Bill's here.

00:07:45.65,00:07:46.99
Bill?

00:07:46.99,00:07:49.12
He's here with Gene.

00:07:52.93,00:07:54.90
Not again!

00:07:54.90,00:07:56.73
You got to come[br]right back, okay?

00:08:03.71,00:08:05.97
Don't be too worried.

00:08:05.97,00:08:07.61
We're gonna work this out.

00:08:07.61,00:08:08.94
Here she comes.

00:08:14.88,00:08:17.65
Why are you[br]not in school?!

00:08:17.65,00:08:19.19
Uhh...

00:08:19.19,00:08:22.39
When I say so,[br]you go to school!

00:08:22.39,00:08:23.63
Do you think I joke?

00:08:23.63,00:08:25.23
You have to study!

00:08:25.23,00:08:28.90
Come on, Selma, stop.

00:08:28.90,00:08:32.07
We talked about this.[br]Didn't we talk about it?

00:08:32.07,00:08:35.24
Hanging out with those[br]automobile thieves.

00:08:35.24,00:08:36.00
So what?

00:08:36.00,00:08:37.74
He's learning.

00:08:37.74,00:08:39.24
Selma,[br]he's learning.

00:08:39.24,00:08:40.41
Aw, come on.

00:08:40.41,00:08:43.45
Gene, this is the most[br]important thing.

00:08:43.45,00:08:45.35
You have to go to school.

00:08:46.72,00:08:48.65
Selma, l--I can...

00:08:48.65,00:08:50.42
drive him back to school[br]if you like.

00:08:50.42,00:08:52.22
Since when was that[br]your business?

00:08:52.22,00:08:53.46
What you doing here?

00:08:53.46,00:08:55.36
If you need[br]a ride home--

00:08:55.36,00:08:56.86
I don't[br]even punch out

00:08:56.86,00:08:58.96
until after[br]another two hours.

00:08:58.96,00:09:01.00
Sometimes you punch out[br]around this time.

00:09:01.00,00:09:02.73
I never punch out early!

00:09:02.73,00:09:04.32
Don't need a dumb...

00:09:05.80,00:09:07.70
Don't need a ride!

00:09:07.70,00:09:09.44
In your little head.

00:09:09.44,00:09:10.61
All right.

00:09:10.61,00:09:12.84
Come on, Mr. G.[br]Let's get you to school.

00:09:33.23,00:09:35.30
Thank you, but l...

00:09:35.30,00:09:38.90
I'll just...[br]I'll just ride my bike.

00:09:38.90,00:09:40.30
Bye, Jeff.

00:09:44.04,00:09:46.14
She likes you.

00:09:46.14,00:09:48.58
I'm sure of it.

00:09:48.58,00:09:49.94
You're sure?

00:09:49.94,00:09:51.84
Yeah, I'm sure of it.

00:09:54.85,00:09:56.58
This is my punishment,

00:09:56.58,00:09:59.42
that you help me with this.

00:09:59.42,00:10:01.89
And you've got...

00:10:03.12,00:10:05.79
You've got to make[br]your bed as well.

00:10:07.33,00:10:10.37
And you forgot[br]to wrap up the bread.

00:10:10.37,00:10:11.86
Two times.

00:10:12.87,00:10:14.90
There's no more of that.

00:10:14.90,00:10:16.63
You keep reading.

00:10:17.64,00:10:19.64
"So long, farewell,

00:10:19.64,00:10:22.44
auf... wiedersehen...

00:10:22.44,00:10:25.65
adieu, adieu, adieu,

00:10:25.65,00:10:27.67
to yieu and yieu and yieu."

00:10:29.62,00:10:30.85
"To yieu...

00:10:30.85,00:10:32.95
and yieu..."

00:10:32.95,00:10:35.56
What does that mean,

00:10:35.56,00:10:36.52
"yieu"?

00:10:38.26,00:10:40.26
It's your dumb musical.

00:10:40.26,00:10:41.63
"And yieu..."

00:10:42.76,00:10:44.32
It's German.

00:10:45.50,00:10:47.90
- You think?[br]- Mm.

00:10:54.81,00:10:56.44
You want[br]some more ketchup?

00:10:56.44,00:10:57.78
No.

00:11:05.29,00:11:07.15
Are you tired?

00:11:11.99,00:11:14.43
Why--why should you...

00:11:14.43,00:11:16.63
always ask me so...

00:11:16.63,00:11:19.07
so stupid questions?

00:11:22.94,00:11:24.43
Shall I show you[br]my step?

00:11:35.95,00:11:39.72
Oh, hi.[br]Hi, Gene.

00:11:39.72,00:11:41.52
How's the dancing?

00:11:41.52,00:11:43.76
Oh... good.

00:11:43.76,00:11:45.49
- Yeah?[br]- Yeah, Yeah.

00:11:45.49,00:11:47.83
You want to come over[br]to me and Bill's place

00:11:47.83,00:11:49.19
and listen[br]to some music?

00:11:50.67,00:11:53.43
That--that[br]would be lovely.

00:11:53.43,00:11:54.74
But... we couldn't.

00:11:54.74,00:11:56.67
Come on.[br]Come on.

00:11:56.67,00:11:59.21
Yeah... uh...

00:11:59.21,00:12:01.04
Let's go.[br]Come on.

00:12:09.78,00:12:12.29
You should ask Bill[br]about his money.

00:12:12.29,00:12:15.48
Linda likes it when[br]we talk about that.

00:12:17.49,00:12:19.86
You're doing[br]a very nice job with these.

00:12:19.86,00:12:22.30
How about that?

00:12:22.30,00:12:23.97
You have to be[br]very careful

00:12:23.97,00:12:25.97
not to bend[br]the card.

00:12:25.97,00:12:27.00
Uh-huh.

00:12:27.00,00:12:30.44
Otherwise I don't[br]get paid for it.

00:12:30.44,00:12:31.97
No.

00:12:31.97,00:12:33.91
That's fair,[br]because...

00:12:33.91,00:12:36.91
the people in the shops[br]would never want to buy it

00:12:36.91,00:12:38.11
if it's bent.

00:12:38.11,00:12:39.81
You wouldn't buy it[br]if it was bent.

00:12:39.81,00:12:40.82
That's true,[br]I wouldn't.

00:12:40.82,00:12:42.61
Wouldn't buy anything[br]if it was bent.

00:12:50.89,00:12:53.29
In Czechoslovakia,

00:12:53.29,00:12:54.53
I saw a film,

00:12:54.53,00:12:58.10
and they were eating candy[br]from a tin

00:12:58.10,00:12:59.10
just like this.

00:12:59.10,00:13:00.97
No.

00:13:00.97,00:13:02.74
I thought to myself...

00:13:02.74,00:13:05.84
how wonderful it must be

00:13:05.84,00:13:08.38
in the United States.

00:13:08.38,00:13:09.94
Yeah?

00:13:09.94,00:13:11.78
You think my house[br]looks like a movie?

00:13:11.78,00:13:13.72
Oh, our house[br]looks like a movie.

00:13:13.72,00:13:15.62
And you look[br]like a movie star.

00:13:18.15,00:13:20.12
Bill gives me[br]a lot of money.

00:13:20.12,00:13:21.46
You know?

00:13:21.46,00:13:22.62
I know.

00:13:22.62,00:13:24.49
Of course, it's all[br]that money you inherited,

00:13:24.49,00:13:26.76
isn't it, Bill?

00:13:26.76,00:13:28.09
That's right.

00:13:31.67,00:13:33.03
Hey, Selma...

00:13:33.03,00:13:34.70
Take the rest[br]with you.

00:13:36.14,00:13:37.41
Are you sure?

00:13:37.41,00:13:39.03
Go on.

00:14:54.52,00:14:56.12
Hello.

00:14:56.12,00:14:58.32
Good morning.

00:14:58.32,00:14:59.75
I've got the rent.

00:14:59.75,00:15:01.22
Oh.

00:15:01.22,00:15:03.26
You always pay[br]right on time.

00:15:03.26,00:15:05.76
Don't worry about Gene.[br]I'll get him off to school,

00:15:05.76,00:15:06.76
okay?

00:15:06.76,00:15:07.76
Thank you.

00:15:07.76,00:15:09.03
Thanks very much.

00:15:09.03,00:15:12.33
Remember your bag.

00:15:12.33,00:15:13.57
Bye-bye.

00:15:13.57,00:15:14.66
Bye.

00:15:16.40,00:15:19.14
I think you're always[br]so serious, Kathy.

00:15:19.14,00:15:21.17
Aw... again we start.

00:15:22.31,00:15:25.18
I don't think inside[br]you're serious at all.

00:15:25.18,00:15:27.01
I don't know.

00:15:27.01,00:15:28.78
Not always.

00:15:28.78,00:15:29.78
Cvalda.

00:15:29.78,00:15:31.82
Why do you[br]call me that?

00:15:31.82,00:15:34.45
It's like...[br]someone who's...

00:15:36.36,00:15:38.96
I don't know,[br]just big and happy.

00:15:38.96,00:15:40.56
I am not that big.

00:15:40.56,00:15:43.10
Happy?[br]I don't know.

00:15:43.10,00:15:45.16
Just need someone[br]to pull it out.

00:15:51.87,00:15:53.17
Beautiful eyes.

00:15:53.17,00:15:54.18
Yeah.

00:15:54.18,00:15:56.30
But he's not[br]real happy, is he?

00:15:57.91,00:15:59.90
How is she doing?

00:16:01.12,00:16:02.75
It's when she[br]cannot keep up,

00:16:02.75,00:16:05.55
and she's going to faint.

00:16:05.55,00:16:06.75
Ah, she fainted.

00:16:06.75,00:16:08.22
Please be quiet.

00:16:08.22,00:16:09.36
Oh, give us a break.

00:16:09.36,00:16:10.73
She doesn't see[br]that well.

00:16:10.73,00:16:12.49
I paid good money[br]to see this film.

00:16:12.49,00:16:13.69
Well, so did she.

00:16:16.96,00:16:18.90
I love it[br]when they dance.

00:16:18.90,00:16:20.74
For Pete's sake,[br]it's a musical.

00:16:20.74,00:16:22.24
Of course they're dancing!

00:16:22.24,00:16:23.17
We know that!

00:16:23.17,00:16:24.44
Oh, you're so smart.

00:16:24.44,00:16:25.80
- Yes.[br]- Oh.

00:16:27.84,00:16:29.97
I think you made[br]friends, Kathy.

00:16:36.05,00:16:37.52
Stop!

00:16:47.46,00:16:49.60
So, what'd she say?

00:16:49.60,00:16:50.60
What?

00:16:50.60,00:16:52.07
What did she say?

00:16:52.07,00:16:54.30
She didn't say[br]anything.

00:16:54.30,00:16:56.17
Are you trying to[br]tell me something?

00:16:57.17,00:16:59.34
It's about the bike.

00:16:59.34,00:17:00.61
The bike?

00:17:00.61,00:17:03.48
Mm, the bike.

00:17:03.48,00:17:04.91
Oh, um, l--I--

00:17:04.91,00:17:07.28
I cannot[br]give Gene a bike.

00:17:07.28,00:17:08.58
Is this his idea?

00:17:08.58,00:17:10.35
No, it's not his idea.

00:17:10.35,00:17:11.35
Gene?

00:17:11.35,00:17:12.72
Yeah?

00:17:12.72,00:17:14.82
Did you ask them[br]to come over?

00:17:14.82,00:17:16.46
No.

00:17:16.46,00:17:18.03
No, he didn't.[br]It doesn't...

00:17:18.03,00:17:20.39
He doesn't know anything,[br]Selma. Frankly.

00:17:20.39,00:17:22.33
Why, have I[br]done something?

00:17:22.33,00:17:23.53
No.

00:17:23.53,00:17:24.93
I haven't got[br]the money.

00:17:24.93,00:17:28.20
But... I'm almost[br]the only kid in class

00:17:28.20,00:17:29.76
who doesn't have[br]a bike.

00:17:30.87,00:17:33.71
I even know a boy[br]who's got a scooter.

00:17:33.71,00:17:35.94
You know I haven't got[br]any money.

00:17:36.98,00:17:38.55
The only extra money I got

00:17:38.55,00:17:40.55
the times I managed[br]to save up,

00:17:40.55,00:17:41.65
I send it...

00:17:41.65,00:17:42.85
to Grandpa.

00:17:42.85,00:17:44.25
- Come have a look.[br]- I'm not gonna get you

00:17:44.25,00:17:45.25
expensive things.

00:17:45.25,00:17:46.55
Your mother[br]is only teasing.

00:17:46.55,00:17:48.82
Look what she's[br]brought for you!

00:17:48.82,00:17:50.79
It's a bike!

00:17:50.79,00:17:51.86
We cannot[br]accept that.

00:17:51.86,00:17:53.59
Selma, it was second-hand.

00:17:53.59,00:17:56.03
I can't give him[br]any expensive things.

00:17:56.03,00:17:57.27
- Yeah, but--[br]- I can't even give it

00:17:57.27,00:17:58.70
for his birthday.

00:17:58.70,00:18:00.77
- Yeah, but, well--[br]- He's just gonna accept that.

00:18:00.77,00:18:02.27
I'm not that sort of mom.

00:18:02.27,00:18:03.74
I'm--I'm--

00:18:03.74,00:18:07.31
I'm just not that kind[br]of mother, Gene. I...

00:18:07.31,00:18:08.84
Can't you be

00:18:08.84,00:18:10.95
that kind[br]of a mother?

00:18:10.95,00:18:12.98
It's not exactly a scooter.

00:18:12.98,00:18:16.12
Hmm... We'll see.

00:18:16.12,00:18:17.45
We'll see.

00:18:17.45,00:18:18.55
Careful!

00:18:18.55,00:18:20.52
Don't ride[br]too fast.

00:18:23.46,00:18:24.98
Hey, gene,[br]bring it over here.

00:18:29.13,00:18:30.77
He looks very happy,[br]doesn't he?

00:18:30.77,00:18:31.70
He does look happy.

00:18:33.07,00:18:34.80
Here he comes again.

00:18:34.80,00:18:35.84
Attention!

00:18:35.84,00:18:37.20
Bring it over here.

00:18:37.20,00:18:38.41
Mom...

00:18:38.41,00:18:41.38
Okay.

00:18:41.38,00:18:43.34
Did you hear[br]what she said?

00:18:43.34,00:18:46.28
- She say okay?[br]- Yeah!

00:18:46.28,00:18:47.72
Did you say okay?

00:18:47.72,00:18:49.31
Yeah.

00:18:50.38,00:18:52.12
Promise to go to school.

00:18:52.12,00:18:55.02
Yes, yes.

00:18:55.02,00:18:56.69
Every day.[br]On time.

00:18:56.69,00:18:59.13
I didn't know you[br]were such a good biker.

00:18:59.93,00:19:02.46
Rust and women[br]are the same.

00:19:02.46,00:19:04.63
"Rust and women[br]are the same"?

00:19:04.63,00:19:06.37
They are the same.

00:19:06.37,00:19:07.60
What is it?

00:19:07.60,00:19:09.27
Your fat Yeah. id that?

00:19:09.27,00:19:10.87
Some joke...

00:19:10.87,00:19:12.86
I don't know[br]what it meant.

00:19:17.38,00:19:19.65
Look at that.[br]Oh, ho...

00:19:19.65,00:19:22.62
You're so kind.[br]Look at me.

00:19:22.62,00:19:24.72
He did all the work,[br]you know that.

00:19:24.72,00:19:26.75
He's really good.

00:19:26.75,00:19:28.92
Thank you, Jeff!

00:19:28.92,00:19:31.45
You're welcome.

00:19:38.73,00:19:40.70
Come in.

00:19:40.70,00:19:43.14
Something up, Bill?

00:19:44.14,00:19:46.80
No, no, I just couldn't[br]sleep, that's all.

00:19:55.18,00:19:56.84
I have no money.

00:19:57.89,00:20:00.35
All the money[br]that I inherited is...

00:20:00.35,00:20:02.05
It's gone.

00:20:06.53,00:20:08.22
And Linda...

00:20:10.06,00:20:12.56
Linda...

00:20:13.60,00:20:16.09
She spends and spends.

00:20:19.24,00:20:21.77
And my salary's[br]nowhere near enough.

00:20:22.78,00:20:25.01
I can't say no to her.

00:20:26.48,00:20:29.04
The bank's gonna[br]repossess the house...

00:20:31.75,00:20:34.41
because I'm so far behind[br]on the payments.

00:20:35.79,00:20:38.53
And I'm gonna lose Linda.

00:20:38.53,00:20:41.40
I know it.

00:20:41.40,00:20:42.89
I know I am.

00:20:47.40,00:20:49.43
She loves you, Bill.

00:20:54.78,00:20:56.77
Oh, don't cry.

00:21:03.55,00:21:05.65
I shouldn't[br]have told you.

00:21:05.65,00:21:06.72
Don't worry.

00:21:06.72,00:21:08.59
- Shouldn't have told you.[br]- It's okay.

00:21:08.59,00:21:09.92
Don't worry.

00:21:09.92,00:21:11.49
No, I think you've[br]got enough... stuff.

00:21:11.49,00:21:12.86
Would it make you[br]feel better

00:21:12.86,00:21:14.96
if I told you[br]a secret?

00:21:14.96,00:21:16.99
What secret[br]could you tell me?

00:21:23.74,00:21:25.83
I'm going blind.

00:21:32.91,00:21:35.12
Not yet, but...

00:21:35.12,00:21:36.52
Soon.

00:21:40.12,00:21:42.11
Maybe sometime[br]this year.

00:21:51.90,00:21:53.59
Blind...

00:21:58.57,00:22:01.56
It's not as bad[br]as it sounds.

00:22:03.11,00:22:04.91
It's, uh...

00:22:04.91,00:22:07.35
It's a family thing.

00:22:11.92,00:22:13.25
But, blind?

00:22:13.25,00:22:15.46
I've always known it.

00:22:15.46,00:22:18.63
From... when I was[br]a little girl,

00:22:18.63,00:22:19.62
I knew.

00:22:24.77,00:22:26.39
And you're okay?

00:22:28.00,00:22:30.47
Well, I came to America

00:22:30.47,00:22:32.44
because in America,

00:22:32.44,00:22:34.98
they can give Gene[br]an operation.

00:22:34.98,00:22:35.96
You know?

00:22:37.24,00:22:38.31
Gene?

00:22:38.31,00:22:40.68
He doesn't know[br]about it.

00:22:41.72,00:22:44.69
You... you[br]mustn't tell him,

00:22:44.69,00:22:47.22
because then[br]it could get worse.

00:22:47.22,00:22:49.36
I just have to save up[br]money, you know,

00:22:49.36,00:22:51.42
enough money to...

00:22:52.43,00:22:55.60
Oh, I almost got it.

00:22:55.60,00:22:57.57
To, uh...

00:22:57.57,00:22:59.83
For the operation.

00:22:59.83,00:23:03.17
They can operate on Gene[br]when he turns 1 3.

00:23:03.17,00:23:05.66
And you made up that story[br]about your father?

00:23:07.04,00:23:09.24
Huh.

00:23:09.24,00:23:11.15
I never had a father.

00:23:11.15,00:23:14.05
I made up[br]his name, too.

00:23:16.25,00:23:18.15
And that's why you[br]put in all these hours

00:23:18.15,00:23:21.38
and do all these pins[br]and do everything you do.

00:23:22.79,00:23:24.23
For him.

00:23:24.23,00:23:26.16
For his operation.

00:23:31.50,00:23:33.57
Well, it is my fault.

00:23:33.57,00:23:35.57
I guess...

00:23:35.57,00:23:37.66
How is it your fault?

00:23:42.91,00:23:46.01
Because l...[br]I knew he would...

00:23:46.01,00:23:48.71
he would have[br]bad eyes like me.

00:23:50.88,00:23:52.39
But I had him...

00:23:52.39,00:23:54.01
all the same.

00:23:57.63,00:23:59.46
You're very strong.

00:24:01.76,00:24:04.50
I'm not strong.

00:24:04.50,00:24:06.20
I've got[br]little games I play

00:24:06.20,00:24:07.86
when it goes really hard.

00:24:10.60,00:24:12.94
When I'm working[br]in the factory...

00:24:14.68,00:24:18.45
and the machines,[br]they make these...

00:24:18.45,00:24:20.28
rhythms...

00:24:23.88,00:24:25.99
And I just start dreaming,

00:24:25.99,00:24:28.26
and it all becomes music.

00:24:28.26,00:24:29.42
But you like movies,[br]don't you?

00:24:29.42,00:24:31.53
- I love the movies.[br]- Yeah?

00:24:31.53,00:24:33.56
I just love[br]the musicals.

00:24:33.56,00:24:36.10
Oh, when they're[br]all tap dancing?

00:24:36.10,00:24:38.10
All of them[br]tap dancing,

00:24:38.10,00:24:40.63
all of them, this[br]huge, long line.

00:24:40.63,00:24:42.17
I... wouldn't you[br]like to be

00:24:42.17,00:24:43.50
in that big,[br]long line?

00:24:45.47,00:24:46.47
Yeah.

00:24:46.47,00:24:47.71
Kicking your feet[br]up there?

00:24:47.71,00:24:48.81
Yeah.

00:24:48.81,00:24:50.88
When they're,[br]like, spiraling up

00:24:50.88,00:24:53.91
the huge,[br]enormous wedding cakes

00:24:53.91,00:24:55.25
to the top?

00:24:55.25,00:24:56.32
Yeah.

00:24:56.32,00:24:57.45
But isn't that annoying

00:24:57.45,00:24:59.69
when they do the last song[br]in the films, though?

00:24:59.69,00:25:00.85
Why?

00:25:00.85,00:25:03.52
Because you just know[br]when it goes really big,

00:25:03.52,00:25:06.96
and the camera goes,[br]like, out of the roof,

00:25:06.96,00:25:09.03
and you just know[br]it's gonna end.

00:25:09.03,00:25:11.03
I hate that.

00:25:11.03,00:25:12.30
I really hate that.

00:25:12.30,00:25:15.24
I used to cheat on that[br]when I was a little girl

00:25:15.24,00:25:17.50
back in Czechoslovakia.

00:25:17.50,00:25:20.31
I would leave the cinema

00:25:20.31,00:25:23.41
just after[br]the next to last song,

00:25:23.41,00:25:26.61
and the film would[br]just go on forever.

00:25:28.85,00:25:30.32
It's lovely, isn't it?

00:25:30.32,00:25:31.78
That is lovely.

00:25:34.02,00:25:35.36
Selma...

00:25:35.36,00:25:37.69
Yeah?

00:25:37.69,00:25:39.66
Thank you for[br]telling me your secret.

00:25:42.50,00:25:44.43
Thanks for[br]telling me yours.

00:25:46.77,00:25:49.04
Mum's the word, right?

00:25:49.04,00:25:51.61
"Mum"?

00:25:51.61,00:25:53.24
We don't tell anybody?

00:25:53.24,00:25:55.38
Oh, yes.

00:25:55.38,00:25:56.97
I won't tell[br]anyone.

00:25:58.45,00:26:00.35
Goodbye.

00:26:00.35,00:26:01.14
Goodbye.

00:26:20.77,00:26:22.24
Oh, thank you.

00:26:22.24,00:26:24.41
So, can I get you[br]another?

00:26:24.41,00:26:26.67
Yeah, sure.

00:26:26.67,00:26:28.34
How about a big one?

00:26:28.34,00:26:30.81
How many is there[br]in a big one?

00:26:30.81,00:26:32.11
1 0,000.

00:26:33.85,00:26:35.41
I'll have a big one.

00:26:39.52,00:26:41.15
What's this[br]guy's name again?

00:26:42.62,00:26:44.23
Who?

00:26:44.23,00:26:45.63
The old man,[br]your old man,

00:26:45.63,00:26:47.99
the guy we're carding[br]these pins for.

00:26:50.00,00:26:51.67
Her father?

00:26:51.67,00:26:54.30
I know.[br]Oldrich.

00:26:54.30,00:26:55.30
Right?

00:26:55.30,00:26:56.64
Yeah.

00:26:56.64,00:26:59.01
Oldrich Novy.

00:26:59.01,00:27:01.48
He used to dance[br]in Prague.

00:27:01.48,00:27:02.88
You commies[br]make a big deal

00:27:02.88,00:27:04.31
out of sharing[br]everything.

00:27:04.31,00:27:06.61
Yeah.

00:27:06.61,00:27:08.75
It's--It's[br]a good thing.

00:27:08.75,00:27:10.72
What are you doing[br]here if, uh...

00:27:10.72,00:27:12.55
Czechoslovakia's[br]so much better

00:27:12.55,00:27:14.08
than the U.S. of A?

00:27:52.29,00:27:54.60
No, Selma, no!

00:27:54.60,00:27:56.46
There are[br]two plates.

00:27:59.97,00:28:01.46
It's all right.

00:28:04.41,00:28:05.71
You know what happens

00:28:05.71,00:28:07.44
when you put two plates[br]in, don't you?

00:28:10.88,00:28:13.41
Well, she didn't do it.[br]I mean, it didn't happen--

00:28:13.41,00:28:14.57
You destroy[br]the tool.

00:28:15.95,00:28:17.48
It takes[br]a whole day

00:28:17.48,00:28:18.55
to mend.

00:28:18.55,00:28:20.65
Never two plates,[br]Selma, never!

00:28:20.65,00:28:22.39
You cheated the doctor.

00:28:22.39,00:28:24.53
You shouldn't be working[br]at the press at all.

00:28:24.53,00:28:27.03
I mean, how dare you![br]Just how much can you see?

00:28:27.03,00:28:28.83
I could do my job[br]with my eyes closed.

00:28:28.83,00:28:30.16
So could you.

00:28:30.16,00:28:31.17
No.

00:28:31.17,00:28:34.17
It's just because[br]I was daydreaming.

00:28:34.17,00:28:35.27
Daydreaming?

00:28:35.27,00:28:37.37
Dreaming about what?

00:28:37.37,00:28:38.74
Oh, I just[br]hear music.

00:28:38.74,00:28:40.97
Come on. I mean,[br]Selma, music?

00:28:40.97,00:28:42.18
You could also[br]cut off your hand

00:28:42.18,00:28:43.74
just like that.[br]You have to watch out

00:28:43.74,00:28:45.01
every second.

00:28:45.01,00:28:46.98
Promise me[br]you'll stay awake.

00:28:48.42,00:28:50.88
I--I promise I will[br]stop daydreaming.

00:28:50.88,00:28:52.45
Aw, you're not--[br]you repeat,

00:28:52.45,00:28:53.75
but you don't[br]even listen to me.

00:28:53.75,00:28:55.55
I don't know why[br]I bother that much.

00:28:58.16,00:29:00.69
Hi, Selma.

00:29:00.69,00:29:02.03
If you're not[br]going with Kathy,

00:29:02.03,00:29:04.06
can I give you[br]a lift?

00:29:04.06,00:29:06.47
I don't want[br]a boyfriend.

00:29:06.47,00:29:08.46
I--I told you.

00:29:09.50,00:29:10.74
Yeah.

00:29:10.74,00:29:12.54
You're a really[br]nice guy, Jeff,

00:29:12.54,00:29:13.57
but...

00:29:13.57,00:29:16.24
I just don't have time[br]for a boyfriend.

00:29:17.71,00:29:20.25
Not right now.

00:29:20.25,00:29:22.75
I know.

00:29:22.75,00:29:26.32
If I wanted a boyfriend,[br]it would be you, Jeff.

00:29:26.32,00:29:27.98
I just don't want one[br]right now.

00:29:34.50,00:29:35.76
All right.

00:29:35.76,00:29:37.10
No problem, you know,

00:29:37.10,00:29:39.12
on the back,[br]to have the bike there.

00:29:40.27,00:29:41.76
Yeah.

00:29:47.57,00:29:48.54
Bye, Jeff.

00:29:48.54,00:29:51.15
I don't think it's[br]very safe, you know,

00:29:51.15,00:29:54.78
to ride a bike[br]wearing glasses and all.

00:29:54.78,00:29:56.22
- Selma?[br]- Bye, jeff.

00:29:56.22,00:29:57.71
Huh?

00:30:05.93,00:30:07.29
Are you okay?

00:30:08.70,00:30:10.25
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:30:11.80,00:30:12.80
Hello, Selm.

00:30:12.80,00:30:14.33
Hi, Bill.

00:30:14.33,00:30:15.97
Headed home?

00:30:15.97,00:30:17.34
Uh, yes.

00:30:17.34,00:30:19.24
Want to put it[br]in the back?

00:30:19.24,00:30:21.78
Oh, that would be[br]lovely. Yes, please.

00:30:21.78,00:30:22.74
Hi, Jeff.

00:30:22.74,00:30:24.68
Hey. Did you[br]see the truck?

00:30:24.68,00:30:26.68
No?

00:30:26.68,00:30:27.68
They're blind,

00:30:27.68,00:30:31.02
driving[br]like crazy.

00:30:31.02,00:30:33.05
He's what?

00:30:33.05,00:30:35.61
He's driving[br]like crazy.

00:30:39.26,00:30:40.83
Getting dirty.

00:30:40.83,00:30:42.52
That's all right.

00:30:44.50,00:30:46.30
Thank you.

00:30:46.30,00:30:47.50
Bye, Jeff.

00:30:47.50,00:30:49.17
Bye.

00:30:49.17,00:30:50.47
Thank you, Bill.

00:30:54.17,00:30:56.51
- Okay?[br]- Okay, yeah.

00:31:01.88,00:31:03.62
If I could just make[br]the next payment,

00:31:03.62,00:31:05.89
I'd have[br]a bit more time.

00:31:05.89,00:31:07.89
Yeah.

00:31:07.89,00:31:10.41
All I need is a loan.

00:31:15.63,00:31:17.12
It'd just be a month.

00:31:19.30,00:31:21.03
This money is Gene's.

00:31:24.24,00:31:25.91
I'm sorry, Bill.

00:31:25.91,00:31:27.74
That's all right.[br]I shouldn't have asked.

00:31:27.74,00:31:29.54
Oh, you had to.[br]Don't worry,

00:31:29.54,00:31:30.48
there's no harm[br]in asking.

00:31:30.48,00:31:31.68
No, no, I[br]shouldn't have asked.

00:31:31.68,00:31:33.91
Linda wants new couches.

00:31:41.22,00:31:43.52
I could always[br]shoot myself.

00:31:45.33,00:31:47.69
You mustn't say[br]things like that.

00:31:49.43,00:31:52.09
It's--[br]Make things easier.

00:31:53.80,00:31:56.87
- You know that, Bill.[br]- Aw, Selma.

00:31:56.87,00:31:58.47
You mustn't say[br]things like that.

00:31:58.47,00:31:59.94
Selma, I'm kidding.

00:32:06.68,00:32:10.05
Hi, Selma.[br]Come on in.

00:32:10.05,00:32:11.18
Hi, Gene.

00:32:11.18,00:32:12.39
Good morning.

00:32:12.39,00:32:13.01
Hi.

00:32:23.56,00:32:26.27
How are you?

00:32:26.27,00:32:27.60
Fine, thank you.

00:32:33.34,00:32:34.34
Can I see the gun?

00:32:34.34,00:32:36.17
Yeah, go on, sure.

00:32:38.75,00:32:41.25
- He's got a gun?[br]- Sure.

00:32:41.25,00:32:42.85
He's a police officer.

00:32:42.85,00:32:45.59
I just didn't know[br]he would keep it here,

00:32:45.59,00:32:46.72
in the house.

00:32:46.72,00:32:48.72
Oh, yeah.[br]Yeah, yeah.

00:32:48.72,00:32:51.25
He keeps it[br]in his desk.

00:32:59.93,00:33:02.20
Maybe I should[br]pay more rent.

00:33:02.20,00:33:03.80
It's been the same

00:33:03.80,00:33:05.74
for the whole period[br]I've been here.

00:33:05.74,00:33:08.34
No, Selma,[br]I won't hear it.

00:33:08.34,00:33:10.24
You keep your money.[br]You need it more

00:33:10.24,00:33:10.94
than we do.

00:34:01.36,00:34:03.30
Two boxes?

00:34:03.30,00:34:05.00
Did you decide[br]you are going to do

00:34:05.00,00:34:06.90
two boxes at[br]the same time now?

00:34:06.90,00:34:07.90
Yeah.

00:34:07.90,00:34:09.84
Selma...[br]1 0:00 then?

00:34:09.84,00:34:12.17
1 0:00.

00:34:13.31,00:34:15.61
What happens[br]at 1 0:00?

00:34:15.61,00:34:18.71
I'm--I'm gonna do[br]the night shift.

00:34:18.71,00:34:20.31
The night shift?

00:34:20.31,00:34:21.55
You can hardly see[br]well enough

00:34:21.55,00:34:23.55
to do your own shift.

00:34:23.55,00:34:25.22
It suits me fine.

00:34:25.22,00:34:27.82
It's just after[br]drama class.

00:34:27.82,00:34:29.38
You are going[br]to do that, too?

00:34:31.93,00:34:33.86
I've had my fill[br]of you, Selma.

00:34:33.86,00:34:35.13
You do[br]what you want.

00:34:35.13,00:34:36.96
Go ahead,[br]break your neck.

00:34:36.96,00:34:38.20
Do your night shift,

00:34:38.20,00:34:39.43
but don't think[br]for one second

00:34:39.43,00:34:41.87
I'm going to come[br]and rescue you.

00:34:48.24,00:34:49.94
Selma?

00:34:52.58,00:34:54.95
Kathy split already.

00:34:54.95,00:34:57.05
I'm not looking[br]for Kathy.

00:34:57.05,00:34:59.08
I was looking[br]for you.

00:35:00.62,00:35:03.19
I just have to go to[br]drama rehearsal.

00:35:03.19,00:35:04.89
So what do you say?

00:35:05.89,00:35:07.53
You can always[br]ride your bike.

00:35:07.53,00:35:10.46
You have it over there.

00:35:10.46,00:35:11.90
I left it at home.

00:35:11.90,00:35:14.47
I thought it'd be[br]quicker if I walked.

00:35:14.47,00:35:16.74
How do you reckon that?

00:35:16.74,00:35:20.14
I just walk along[br]the railroad tracks.

00:35:21.68,00:35:23.81
It's a...

00:35:23.81,00:35:25.14
shortcut.

00:35:44.50,00:35:48.40
Look, I don't understand.[br]In musicals...

00:35:48.40,00:35:51.96
why do they start to sing[br]and dance all of a sudden?

00:35:53.11,00:35:58.45
I mean, I don't suddenly[br]start... to sing and dance.

00:35:58.45,00:35:59.41
No...

00:36:01.38,00:36:04.25
You're right, Jeff.[br]You don't.

00:36:04.25,00:36:08.52
The last thing on the list[br]is the bake sale.

00:36:08.52,00:36:10.39
Two sundays away.

00:36:12.19,00:36:15.13
Hi, Selma.[br]Come on in, come on in.

00:36:15.13,00:36:17.66
I'm gonna introduce you[br]to your understudy.

00:36:17.66,00:36:19.47
My understudy?

00:36:19.47,00:36:20.47
Yeah.

00:36:20.47,00:36:22.90
This girl Suzan,[br]who boris knows,

00:36:22.90,00:36:25.81
is a good singer.[br]She's a good dancer.

00:36:25.81,00:36:27.44
She'll learn[br]your part, too,

00:36:27.44,00:36:30.44
because, say,[br]you get a cold,

00:36:30.44,00:36:32.21
and...

00:36:32.21,00:36:33.28
you can't do it,

00:36:33.28,00:36:36.38
then the show[br]doesn't have to stop.

00:36:36.38,00:36:37.38
Okay?

00:36:37.38,00:36:40.58
Suzan, Selma.[br]Selma, Suzan.

00:36:43.16,00:36:45.39
Could you take off[br]your glasses?

00:36:50.80,00:36:52.40
I think[br]we'll do the part

00:36:52.40,00:36:53.97
without glasses.

00:36:53.97,00:36:56.54
Next sunday,[br]you will see

00:36:56.54,00:36:58.27
both Marias.

00:36:58.27,00:37:00.14
I mean, Selma will[br]do the role, really,

00:37:00.14,00:37:02.54
but... i'll have you[br]read part of it too.

00:37:02.54,00:37:03.57
All right?

00:37:05.45,00:37:06.75
It's your first time[br]on the night shift,

00:37:06.75,00:37:07.75
right?

00:37:07.75,00:37:09.52
While this[br]is being pressed,

00:37:09.52,00:37:10.95
you'll be cutting[br]on the other machine.

00:37:10.95,00:37:13.25
That means[br]you'll be in charge

00:37:13.25,00:37:16.22
of two machines.

00:37:16.22,00:37:20.13
You have to beat Sarah[br]over there, right?

00:37:20.13,00:37:22.06
This pallet must[br]never be empty.

00:37:22.06,00:37:24.16
Is it always[br]so dark in here?

00:37:24.16,00:37:25.17
What?

00:37:25.17,00:37:26.43
Is it always[br]so dark in here?

00:37:26.43,00:37:28.13
It's exactly the same[br]as the daytime.

00:37:28.13,00:37:29.30
Oh.[br]Okay.

00:37:29.30,00:37:31.24
The only thing is you have[br]to work a little faster.

00:37:31.24,00:37:32.44
That's what[br]you're paid for, right?

00:37:32.44,00:37:33.54
- Okay.[br]- Okay?

00:37:33.54,00:37:34.53
Thank you.

00:37:56.96,00:37:59.10
- Excuse me.[br]- Yeah?

00:37:59.10,00:38:00.23
You have to work[br]a little, you know,

00:38:00.23,00:38:01.60
a little faster[br]than this.

00:38:01.60,00:38:02.69
Okay.

00:38:26.83,00:38:29.36
What are you[br]doing here?

00:38:29.36,00:38:30.73
What do you think?

00:38:35.80,00:38:39.37
I didn't put you down for[br]the night shift, Kathy.

00:38:39.37,00:38:40.87
Run along, Norman.

00:38:40.87,00:38:42.98
I'm on my own time now.

00:38:42.98,00:38:45.15
How I spend it[br]is my own business.

00:38:45.15,00:38:46.81
'Night, ladies!

00:38:46.81,00:38:47.84
Good night!

00:38:49.95,00:38:51.65
Faster.

00:38:51.65,00:38:53.02
A little faster.

00:38:53.02,00:38:55.56
I like it better[br]when you dance.

00:38:55.56,00:38:58.09
You should dance[br]more... Cvalda.

00:38:58.09,00:39:00.86
I will dance[br]when there is music.

00:40:11.87,00:40:13.70
It's music.

00:40:13.70,00:40:15.36
Now dance.

00:43:27.43,00:43:28.62
Selma!

00:43:29.63,00:43:30.96
Stop that,[br]you've cut yourself!

00:43:30.96,00:43:32.60
Get away from[br]the machine!

00:43:32.60,00:43:33.90
Henry!

00:43:41.61,00:43:44.08
Oh, Jeff is here.

00:43:45.78,00:43:47.48
Hello, Jeff.

00:43:47.48,00:43:48.65
Hi, Kathy.

00:43:48.65,00:43:50.31
Do you live here?

00:43:52.15,00:43:54.42
Thought she might[br]say yes to a ride

00:43:54.42,00:43:56.29
when it's[br]this late.

00:43:56.29,00:43:58.22
M-maybe Kathy...

00:43:58.22,00:43:59.76
wants a ride.

00:43:59.76,00:44:01.69
No, it's all right.

00:44:02.86,00:44:04.70
What's that,[br]with your hand?

00:44:04.70,00:44:06.53
She cut her...

00:44:06.53,00:44:07.87
Cut my finger.

00:44:07.87,00:44:09.94
Yeah. It's going[br]to be all right.

00:44:09.94,00:44:12.44
The plates are sharp.

00:44:12.44,00:44:13.44
Goodnight.

00:44:13.44,00:44:14.43
Careful.

00:45:13.97,00:45:16.59
I think I found[br]a solution to our problem.

00:45:19.31,00:45:21.91
That makes me[br]really happy.

00:45:21.91,00:45:24.91
It's nothing special...

00:45:24.91,00:45:27.15
But I've made up my mind.[br]I'm gonna tell Linda,

00:45:27.15,00:45:28.70
and, uh...

00:45:33.05,00:45:35.78
I mean, after all,[br]she loves me, and...

00:45:40.29,00:45:42.06
We'll just[br]work it out together.

00:45:43.10,00:45:46.00
That sounds like[br]a really good idea, Bill.

00:45:54.24,00:45:56.48
I'm sorry, I'll[br]let you get to bed.

00:45:56.48,00:45:58.14
I guess I'm kinda tired.

00:45:59.35,00:46:00.85
Thanks, Bill.

00:46:00.85,00:46:02.08
Good night, Selma.

00:46:02.08,00:46:03.41
Good night, Bill.

00:46:14.33,00:46:15.73
Bill?

00:47:39.98,00:47:41.61
What's happening now?

00:48:04.44,00:48:06.37
Here we go.[br]Selma, are you ready?

00:48:15.68,00:48:16.82
And...

00:48:16.82,00:48:17.78
You're on.

00:48:22.56,00:48:24.76
Cut. Cut, stop.

00:48:24.76,00:48:26.89
Stop, please.

00:48:26.89,00:48:29.13
This is Selma's entrance, okay?

00:48:29.13,00:48:30.76
Yeah?

00:48:31.86,00:48:33.70
Okay, Paul, please.

00:48:36.67,00:48:39.04
How far[br]do you think it is?

00:48:39.04,00:48:40.63
I don't know.

00:48:46.31,00:48:47.37
And...

00:48:51.05,00:48:52.95
Kathy, what[br]are you doing?

00:48:52.95,00:48:54.95
This is[br]Maria's entrance.

00:48:54.95,00:48:56.46
Yes.[br]I'm sorry.

00:48:56.46,00:48:57.72
My mistake.

00:48:57.72,00:48:58.86
Please, please!

00:48:58.86,00:48:59.93
I don't have[br]all night!

00:48:59.93,00:49:00.99
Six steps.

00:49:00.99,00:49:02.93
Let's take this[br]a little more seriously.

00:49:13.01,00:49:14.17
Good!

00:49:14.17,00:49:16.64
Okay, I'm thinking[br]maybe, Selma...

00:49:16.64,00:49:19.25
You could take a little[br]sort of circle around Boris

00:49:19.25,00:49:20.81
on this next part,

00:49:20.81,00:49:24.25
unless you have something else[br]you wanna suggest.

00:49:24.25,00:49:26.69
I'm open.

00:49:26.69,00:49:28.59
Okay?

00:49:28.59,00:49:29.96
Samuel.

00:49:29.96,00:49:31.89
Yes?

00:49:31.89,00:49:33.23
I need to[br]talk to you.

00:49:33.23,00:49:35.83
Oh, Selma, please, if[br]it's about the drummer,

00:49:35.83,00:49:37.50
I have been looking[br]everywhere for a drummer--

00:49:37.50,00:49:39.60
It's not[br]about the drummer.

00:49:39.60,00:49:41.09
It's not[br]about the drummer.

00:49:45.71,00:49:48.07
Um... just a quick word.

00:49:48.07,00:49:49.91
Do you wanna[br]go outside?

00:49:49.91,00:49:50.98
Yup.

00:49:50.98,00:49:52.10
Okay.

00:50:01.52,00:50:04.76
I--I'm not[br]gonna play Maria.

00:50:04.76,00:50:06.62
What?

00:50:07.86,00:50:10.16
My heart just[br]isn't in this...

00:50:10.16,00:50:12.57
Like, I shouldn't[br]be wasting my time

00:50:12.57,00:50:14.03
on something...

00:50:14.03,00:50:16.93
that isn't...[br]that important really.

00:50:19.97,00:50:23.01
I've been watching Suzan,[br]and she's...

00:50:23.01,00:50:24.08
She's great.

00:50:24.08,00:50:26.68
She's... She's very--

00:50:26.68,00:50:28.55
She's a much better dancer[br]than I am.

00:50:28.55,00:50:29.55
Terrific.

00:50:29.55,00:50:32.52
Suzan's terrific.[br]I'm not denying that,

00:50:32.52,00:50:35.35
but you--I thought[br]you lived for musicals.

00:50:35.35,00:50:37.79
So you've been pretending[br]the whole time?

00:50:37.79,00:50:39.86
Yes.

00:50:39.86,00:50:42.76
I've just been pretending.

00:50:42.76,00:50:44.76
I don't know what else[br]I could do with you.

00:50:44.76,00:50:46.17
I've got everything[br]cast right now.

00:50:46.17,00:50:48.13
Yeah.

00:50:48.13,00:50:50.64
The only part that's left[br]is the old nun

00:50:50.64,00:50:53.04
who lets maria out[br]of the convent gate.

00:50:53.04,00:50:54.34
I don't think[br]you'd want that part.

00:50:54.34,00:50:57.68
There's no dancing[br]in that.

00:50:57.68,00:50:59.51
She's[br]quite serious then?

00:50:59.51,00:51:00.98
She's serious.

00:51:00.98,00:51:03.05
It's important[br]for the part.

00:51:03.05,00:51:04.95
Okay. I'm not[br]dancing really.

00:51:06.25,00:51:07.89
No.

00:51:07.89,00:51:10.96
I could put a little bit[br]of dancing in there.

00:51:10.96,00:51:12.49
You think so?

00:51:12.49,00:51:16.06
It--I didn't[br]have it in mind.

00:51:16.06,00:51:18.86
You can have[br]your tapping.

00:51:18.86,00:51:21.80
She could be just[br]a little... humorous

00:51:21.80,00:51:23.47
once in a while...

00:51:23.47,00:51:25.10
even though[br]she's a nun.

00:51:28.11,00:51:30.23
You'll always be[br]my perfect Maria.

00:51:33.15,00:51:35.85
Where are all[br]the hairpins today?

00:51:35.85,00:51:37.62
I left them at home.

00:51:37.62,00:51:40.32
And she won't be[br]playing Maria.

00:51:40.32,00:51:42.32
What do you reckon[br]I'm gonna do

00:51:42.32,00:51:43.76
if I can't bawl you out[br]for learning your lines

00:51:43.76,00:51:44.95
on company time?

00:51:46.29,00:51:48.26
One...two...

00:51:48.26,00:51:49.49
Three!

00:51:52.26,00:51:54.40
What kind of a joke[br]is that?

00:51:54.40,00:51:55.30
Well, she's beating me.

00:51:55.30,00:51:57.50
I need a word with you.

00:51:57.50,00:51:59.11
We're talking[br]right now.

00:51:59.11,00:52:00.87
All right...

00:52:00.87,00:52:02.24
Come on.

00:52:10.82,00:52:12.18
Please sit down.

00:52:15.12,00:52:17.92
We were off[br]for the whole day.

00:52:17.92,00:52:19.93
Everything stops when[br]the machine breaks.

00:52:19.93,00:52:21.15
You know that.

00:52:22.66,00:52:25.97
I--I can do my job[br]just fine...

00:52:25.97,00:52:29.34
if I stick[br]to the day shift.

00:52:29.34,00:52:31.54
This won't happen again.

00:52:31.54,00:52:34.94
Look, I daydream[br]too much.

00:52:34.94,00:52:37.74
I--I decided to quit.

00:52:39.91,00:52:41.04
And...

00:52:42.82,00:52:45.68
And I guess,[br]then l--I forgot.

00:52:48.82,00:52:51.29
I've been ordered[br]to let you go, Selma.

00:52:58.56,00:53:00.20
You're not[br]gonna have to pay

00:53:00.20,00:53:01.73
for the machine[br]you broke.

00:53:01.73,00:53:04.07
I got them[br]to agree to that.

00:53:04.07,00:53:05.66
Uh, thanks, Norman.

00:53:10.24,00:53:13.64
This is your salary.

00:53:15.25,00:53:18.58
And you know, um...

00:53:18.58,00:53:20.79
Maybe we can find you[br]something

00:53:20.79,00:53:23.62
away from the machines

00:53:23.62,00:53:25.79
where your eyesight[br]wouldn't matter so much.

00:53:25.79,00:53:26.69
Yeah...

00:53:26.69,00:53:28.49
Not right away.

00:53:28.49,00:53:30.26
That's very kind[br]of you.

00:53:30.26,00:53:31.53
I better go.

00:53:31.53,00:53:34.90
I'll be okay.[br]I really will.

00:53:34.90,00:53:36.77
Thanks, Norman.

00:53:36.77,00:53:38.50
Thank you, Selma.

00:53:38.50,00:53:39.49
Thank you.

00:53:57.66,00:53:59.53
What is she[br]going to do now?

00:53:59.53,00:54:01.36
Did you ever think[br]about that?

00:54:04.86,00:54:06.97
Don't worry, Kathy.[br]Really.

00:54:06.97,00:54:08.52
I'm gonna be fine.

00:54:11.17,00:54:12.91
Has anybody[br]seen Jeff today?

00:54:12.91,00:54:14.97
He's usually here[br]early, Selma,

00:54:14.97,00:54:16.84
but not this early.

00:54:16.84,00:54:18.17
It's a shame.

00:54:27.85,00:54:29.68
Selma!

00:54:31.82,00:54:33.85
Selma...

00:54:37.60,00:54:40.07
I could give you[br]a lift if you want.

00:54:40.07,00:54:42.57
I--I will need a lift...

00:54:42.57,00:54:45.57
Later.

00:54:45.57,00:54:47.24
I need to do[br]something important

00:54:47.24,00:54:49.47
at...at 3:00.

00:54:50.61,00:54:53.91
Well, you need to get[br]your truck then, don't you?

00:54:54.95,00:54:55.91
Yeah.

00:55:04.09,00:55:07.56
Train's coming.[br]Get off the track, Jeff.

00:55:07.56,00:55:10.20
You have to be careful.

00:55:10.20,00:55:11.79
Stay to the side.

00:55:18.60,00:55:20.70
You can't see,[br]can you?

00:55:38.19,00:55:40.92
What is there to see?

01:00:40.53,01:00:43.02
You can't see,[br]can you?

01:00:45.06,01:00:46.96
See you at 3:00.

01:00:53.74,01:00:55.50
I can see.

01:01:50.66,01:01:53.03
Gene hasn't[br]come back yet.

01:01:55.70,01:01:58.60
I need to talk to Bill.

01:01:58.60,01:02:00.14
He decided to[br]take the day off

01:02:00.14,01:02:02.27
to go to the bank[br]for his box.

01:02:04.31,01:02:05.94
Is he--is he upstairs?

01:02:05.94,01:02:06.93
Yeah.

01:02:09.45,01:02:11.68
I know everything, Selma.

01:02:11.68,01:02:13.05
Bill told me.

01:02:13.05,01:02:15.52
I want you to move out!

01:02:20.49,01:02:22.39
I--I don't understand.

01:02:22.39,01:02:24.69
Wh-what would you know?

01:02:27.23,01:02:29.70
That you came on[br]to him.

01:02:29.70,01:02:32.10
That you asked him[br]into the trailer,

01:02:32.10,01:02:33.87
but he[br]turned you down!

01:02:39.71,01:02:41.98
You've got nothing[br]to say for yourself?

01:02:43.85,01:02:45.62
No.

01:02:45.62,01:02:47.45
I want to talk to Bill.

01:03:07.44,01:03:09.10
Hi, Bill.

01:03:12.48,01:03:15.00
Linda saw me go up[br]to the, um...

01:03:17.38,01:03:19.35
Up to the trailer.

01:03:21.75,01:03:24.72
I told her it was you[br]who wanted to, uh...

01:03:24.72,01:03:26.46
That you'd...

01:03:26.46,01:03:29.33
That you'd fallen[br]in love with me.

01:03:30.43,01:03:33.73
I know.[br]She told me.

01:03:33.73,01:03:35.63
And what did[br]you tell her?

01:03:35.63,01:03:37.50
Nothing.

01:03:37.50,01:03:40.67
You didn't tell her[br]I was lying?

01:03:40.67,01:03:43.00
Mum's the word, right?

01:03:50.38,01:03:52.85
Linda told me[br]you went to the bank.

01:03:54.89,01:03:57.05
I went to the bank[br]to ask for more time.

01:04:01.59,01:04:03.03
But I couldn't do it.

01:04:03.03,01:04:06.36
And I brought the box[br]home instead.

01:04:07.37,01:04:08.87
Linda always[br]gets so proud

01:04:08.87,01:04:11.43
when she sees me[br]sitting in here with it.

01:04:13.04,01:04:15.77
But you have put[br]my money in it,

01:04:15.77,01:04:17.14
haven't you?

01:04:19.58,01:04:22.34
To make it look[br]like it's yours.

01:04:33.70,01:04:36.94
I'm gonna have to take it.

01:04:36.94,01:04:38.66
Well, you[br]can have it back.

01:04:41.41,01:04:42.91
No, you can have it.

01:04:42.91,01:04:43.91
Bill...

01:04:43.91,01:04:47.04
You can have it back[br]in a month.

01:04:50.83,01:04:53.00
But--but I can't[br]do that, Bill.

01:04:53.00,01:04:54.00
Selma.

01:04:54.00,01:04:57.07
I--I've decided to...

01:04:57.07,01:04:58.84
to pay the doctor

01:04:58.84,01:05:01.48
this afternoon.

01:05:01.48,01:05:03.98
I can't save up more money.

01:05:03.98,01:05:05.81
That's over now.

01:05:11.62,01:05:13.59
Gene doesn't[br]even turn 1 3

01:05:13.59,01:05:15.96
until after christmas.

01:05:15.96,01:05:19.53
It was $2,026

01:05:19.53,01:05:21.86
and 1 0 cents

01:05:21.86,01:05:23.19
in the tin.

01:05:25.00,01:05:27.73
I can't count it now,[br]but I trust you.

01:05:29.61,01:05:31.81
And it's...

01:05:31.81,01:05:34.30
$30 I got today...

01:05:35.58,01:05:37.25
which makes it

01:05:37.25,01:05:41.31
2,056...

01:05:42.32,01:05:43.89
and 1 0 cents.

01:05:43.89,01:05:46.05
It's not enough.

01:05:47.19,01:05:48.72
But it'll have to do.

01:05:48.72,01:05:50.26
Selma...

01:05:50.26,01:05:52.82
- Bye, Bill.[br]- Selma...

01:05:59.80,01:06:02.07
Selma, stop.

01:06:04.24,01:06:05.83
I'm pointing my gun[br]at you, Selma.

01:06:11.35,01:06:13.58
I don't believe you.

01:06:13.58,01:06:15.88
You're just trying[br]to scare me.

01:06:15.88,01:06:17.91
I can't see a gun.

01:06:18.79,01:06:20.59
Selma...

01:06:20.59,01:06:22.42
Just... feel this.[br]Feel this.

01:06:22.42,01:06:24.52
Just feel it![br]Feel it!

01:06:26.96,01:06:29.06
Do you believe[br]I have the gun?

01:06:29.06,01:06:31.50
I believe you.

01:06:31.50,01:06:32.77
But it's my money.

01:06:32.77,01:06:34.70
No, it's my money.

01:06:34.70,01:06:37.04
It's the money[br]I had in my box.

01:06:37.04,01:06:39.07
And you're trying[br]to steal it from me.

01:06:39.07,01:06:41.08
Selma?

01:06:41.08,01:06:43.18
Selma![br]Selma, stop!

01:06:43.18,01:06:45.11
Selma, stop![br]Linda!

01:06:45.11,01:06:46.65
- No![br]- Linda! Linda!

01:06:46.65,01:06:48.81
What's the matter,[br]Bill?

01:06:51.32,01:06:53.34
She tried to[br]steal the money.

01:06:54.89,01:06:56.76
She knew I had[br]the gun in my...

01:06:56.76,01:06:58.39
in my drawer[br]and she--

01:06:58.39,01:06:59.73
Is that why[br]you wanted him,

01:06:59.73,01:07:01.13
for the money?

01:07:01.13,01:07:03.23
Go out to the car[br]and get my handcuffs.

01:07:03.23,01:07:05.39
Go get the handcuffs.

01:07:07.64,01:07:10.34
Give me the money.

01:07:10.34,01:07:12.37
Give me the money.

01:07:12.37,01:07:15.31
Give me the money[br]and i'll let you go.

01:07:15.31,01:07:16.71
No.

01:07:16.71,01:07:18.11
No.

01:07:18.11,01:07:19.41
Where should I go?

01:07:20.68,01:07:22.28
Just give me[br]the money.

01:07:22.28,01:07:24.35
Selma.

01:07:24.35,01:07:26.49
Just give me[br]the money!

01:07:26.49,01:07:27.56
The money.

01:07:27.56,01:07:28.96
Give me the money!

01:07:28.96,01:07:30.06
No!

01:07:30.06,01:07:30.86
No!

01:07:30.86,01:07:32.38
- Get--[br]- No!

01:07:35.66,01:07:37.00
Bill![br]Oh, Bill!

01:07:41.60,01:07:43.07
You shot me.

01:07:49.51,01:07:51.15
No, no, Selma.

01:07:51.15,01:07:52.78
You did the right thing.

01:07:52.78,01:07:55.38
I should've done it[br]myself.

01:08:01.36,01:08:02.95
Kill me.

01:08:05.46,01:08:07.36
Just kill me.

01:08:08.56,01:08:11.47
Will you just be[br]my friend...

01:08:11.47,01:08:14.00
and show some mercy,[br]please, and just...

01:08:14.00,01:08:15.07
kill me?

01:08:15.07,01:08:17.77
Your handcuffs aren't[br]in the car, Bill.

01:08:17.77,01:08:19.47
Just show[br]some mercy, Selma,

01:08:19.47,01:08:20.84
and just...

01:08:25.38,01:08:26.98
Linda, run.

01:08:26.98,01:08:29.32
Run up to Miller's farm.[br]Just run up to Miller's farm

01:08:29.32,01:08:31.92
and call the station.[br]Tell them to hurry.

01:08:31.92,01:08:34.82
Run! Get up there![br]Go on to Miller's farm!

01:08:37.73,01:08:39.72
If you want[br]the money...

01:08:45.07,01:08:47.64
you're gonna have[br]to kill me.

01:08:47.64,01:08:51.20
Don't do this to me.

01:09:00.42,01:09:02.41
Don't do this[br]to me.

01:09:04.19,01:09:05.88
I'm not letting go.

01:09:07.96,01:09:10.03
No.

01:09:10.03,01:09:11.93
Selma, shoot me!

01:09:11.93,01:09:14.10
Just shoot me![br]Shoot me! Shoot me!

01:09:14.10,01:09:16.79
Shoot me!!

01:09:31.25,01:09:33.01
Cant't you[br]just stand up

01:09:33.01,01:09:35.68
and pull[br]the goddamn trigger!

01:09:56.47,01:09:58.74
I'll have to[br]take the money.

01:15:03.34,01:15:04.97
Forgive me.

01:18:42.46,01:18:43.93
Selma?

01:18:48.57,01:18:51.09
Jeff.

01:18:58.51,01:19:00.45
What are you[br]doing here?

01:19:05.39,01:19:07.08
Is it already 3:00?

01:19:09.52,01:19:11.16
Uh, not really.

01:19:11.16,01:19:12.99
Hell, I'm always early.

01:19:21.67,01:19:24.21
You cut yourself again.

01:19:24.21,01:19:26.97
There's some blood[br]on your blouse.

01:19:26.97,01:19:30.14
Strange.

01:19:30.14,01:19:32.34
I couldn't feel it[br]at all.

01:20:08.85,01:20:10.44
Selma...

01:20:12.32,01:20:13.91
We're here now.

01:20:20.66,01:20:22.39
By the bus stop?

01:20:24.63,01:20:26.57
Yeah, the bus stop.

01:20:27.57,01:20:29.64
It's over there.

01:20:29.64,01:20:32.47
And the lake[br]is here?

01:20:32.47,01:20:35.28
Promise me[br]that you won't follow me.

01:20:35.28,01:20:37.34
Promise.

01:20:41.82,01:20:43.65
Yeah, I promise.

01:22:29.82,01:22:32.49
Dobry Vecer,[br]Pane Doktore.

01:22:32.49,01:22:34.23
Dobry Vecer.

01:22:34.23,01:22:36.92
I would like to pay[br]for the operation now.

01:22:39.10,01:22:41.97
$2,056...

01:22:41.97,01:22:45.37
and 1 0 cents.

01:22:45.37,01:22:47.71
I know it's not quite

01:22:47.71,01:22:50.75
what you told me, but...

01:22:50.75,01:22:52.65
but it's all[br]I could get together.

01:22:52.65,01:22:54.41
Well.

01:22:58.19,01:22:59.99
What last name

01:22:59.99,01:23:01.62
shall I put[br]on the receipt?

01:23:01.62,01:23:04.69
Oh, I don't need[br]a receipt.

01:23:04.69,01:23:07.23
I really don't.

01:23:07.23,01:23:09.13
I have to know[br]the name of your son.

01:23:09.13,01:23:11.33
When he comes in[br]for his operation.

01:23:13.20,01:23:14.76
Novy...

01:23:17.37,01:23:18.77
He will come,

01:23:18.77,01:23:21.74
and he will say[br]that his name is Novy.

01:23:23.41,01:23:26.21
And then[br]you will know...

01:23:26.21,01:23:28.15
that he has[br]been paid for.

01:23:28.15,01:23:30.55
Novy?

01:23:30.55,01:23:33.79
Like Oldrich Novy,

01:23:33.79,01:23:35.56
the tap dancer?

01:23:35.56,01:23:37.49
It is strange,[br]isn't it?

01:23:37.49,01:23:39.19
But he never really[br]made it over here,

01:23:39.19,01:23:40.93
did he?

01:23:40.93,01:23:44.90
I saw his films[br]when I was a kid.

01:23:44.90,01:23:47.20
He was in[br]the first musical

01:23:47.20,01:23:49.37
I ever saw.

01:23:49.37,01:23:51.27
Same here.

01:23:56.88,01:23:58.54
Selma?

01:24:13.46,01:24:15.45
It's Tuesday night.

01:24:18.43,01:24:20.16
What about[br]your rehearsal?

01:24:23.10,01:24:24.70
Yeah, I guess.

01:24:26.34,01:24:28.44
You want to go?

01:24:28.44,01:24:30.24
Yeah.

01:24:30.24,01:24:31.95
Then maybe put[br]your arm around her,

01:24:31.95,01:24:33.81
and... a little bit of...

01:24:35.58,01:24:37.18
Hi, Selma.

01:24:37.18,01:24:39.49
Hi, Samuel.

01:24:39.49,01:24:42.01
We weren't sure you'd[br]show up, actually.

01:24:43.29,01:24:44.66
Sure, I'd show up.

01:24:46.83,01:24:47.83
Hi.

01:24:47.83,01:24:49.53
Nice to see you.

01:24:49.53,01:24:50.23
Be right back.

01:24:50.23,01:24:51.63
Okay.

01:25:06.71,01:25:08.75
She's here.

01:25:08.75,01:25:09.75
Yeah.

01:25:09.75,01:25:11.34
Okay.

01:25:12.52,01:25:13.51
Okay.

01:25:18.16,01:25:20.36
Okay, I think--I[br]think you could...

01:25:20.36,01:25:23.46
try it one more time[br]for me.

01:25:23.46,01:25:26.17
But I should--[br]I should be going now.

01:25:26.17,01:25:28.60
I think Gene may wonder[br]where I am.

01:25:30.60,01:25:32.91
Jeff, he--he hasn't[br]seen me all day.

01:25:32.91,01:25:35.01
I think maybe we[br]could do your scene.

01:25:35.01,01:25:36.91
Let's do[br]the tapping scene.

01:25:36.91,01:25:39.38
Okay? We haven't[br]done it in weeks,

01:25:39.38,01:25:40.82
and we really need[br]to rehearse it,

01:25:40.82,01:25:41.98
and while you're here,[br]we might as well

01:25:41.98,01:25:44.99
take advantage[br]of the time, please?

01:25:44.99,01:25:46.45
Okay, let's do[br]the tapping scene.

01:25:46.45,01:25:47.59
You come offstage--

01:25:47.59,01:25:48.96
Let me have[br]the nuns up there.

01:25:48.96,01:25:50.36
Imagi--[br]you're going to do

01:25:50.36,01:25:51.36
Selma's part[br]for her

01:25:51.36,01:25:52.72
for right now,[br]all right?

01:25:57.30,01:25:58.37
You like it?

01:25:58.37,01:26:00.60
Yes.

01:26:00.60,01:26:02.54
We haven't done it[br]for a while.

01:26:28.20,01:26:29.70
Remember that part[br]we did where--

01:26:29.70,01:26:31.23
where you, uh...

01:26:31.23,01:26:33.37
you come to[br]the convent gate

01:26:33.37,01:26:35.57
to say goodbye[br]to the--to Maria?

01:26:35.57,01:26:37.57
I should leave, Jeff.

01:26:37.57,01:26:38.64
What?

01:26:38.64,01:26:40.61
Gene--Gene is[br]probably worried now.

01:26:40.61,01:26:42.81
I haven't seen him[br]all day.

01:26:42.81,01:26:44.14
All right.

01:26:46.61,01:26:48.78
I'm sorry, Samuel, but...

01:26:48.78,01:26:50.62
Betty, come here[br]for a second, please.

01:26:50.62,01:26:51.72
The drummer[br]that you wanted--

01:26:51.72,01:26:53.29
Remember, you asked[br]me for a drummer?

01:26:53.29,01:26:55.22
I found somebody.[br]She's fantastic.

01:26:55.22,01:26:56.62
Her name's Betty.[br]She's right here

01:26:56.62,01:26:57.76
for the first time[br]tonight.

01:26:57.76,01:27:00.69
Please meet her.[br]Selma, this is Betty.

01:27:00.69,01:27:01.93
Hi, Betty.

01:27:01.93,01:27:04.93
You play the drums?

01:27:04.93,01:27:06.00
Yeah.

01:27:06.00,01:27:07.57
Tell her how long[br]you've been studying.

01:27:07.57,01:27:08.94
Two years.

01:27:08.94,01:27:10.70
She's wonderful.

01:27:10.70,01:27:12.17
You've got to stay[br]and enjoy this.

01:27:12.17,01:27:14.07
You've got to--[br]I have an idea.

01:27:14.07,01:27:16.34
Let's do the finale.

01:27:16.44,01:27:19.38
I just remembered,[br]you hate finales.

01:27:19.38,01:27:20.98
No finale!

01:27:20.98,01:27:23.35
I've a better idea.

01:27:23.35,01:27:25.28
"Climb Every Mountain,"[br]part one.

01:29:26.77,01:29:28.51
The state will show

01:29:28.51,01:29:31.25
that the defendant[br]has not only perpetrated

01:29:31.25,01:29:33.35
the most callous...

01:29:33.35,01:29:36.32
and well-planned homicide[br]in recent memory...

01:29:37.75,01:29:41.09
but is also[br]a fundamentally selfish

01:29:41.09,01:29:43.39
individual...

01:29:43.39,01:29:45.43
who cynically hides

01:29:45.43,01:29:47.33
behind a handicap,

01:29:47.33,01:29:49.60
devoid of sympathy[br]for anybody

01:29:49.60,01:29:51.06
but herself.

01:29:52.67,01:29:55.84
This woman found[br]trust and friendship

01:29:55.84,01:29:59.71
when she sought refuge[br]in our country,

01:29:59.71,01:30:01.41
and the evidence will show

01:30:01.41,01:30:04.55
that she has repaid[br]such kindness with betrayal,

01:30:04.55,01:30:06.35
robbery, and murder,

01:30:06.35,01:30:08.82
inflicted upon[br]the very people

01:30:08.82,01:30:11.84
who opened their homes[br]and hearts to her.

01:30:14.05,01:30:15.78
Ladies and gentlemen[br]of the jury...

01:30:16.86,01:30:19.63
The evidence will prove[br]that she herself...

01:30:19.63,01:30:23.08
did not show that mercy[br]she will ask of us.

01:30:24.40,01:30:27.37
Is this the bag here,[br]detective?

01:30:30.90,01:30:32.11
Yes,[br]the very same.

01:30:32.11,01:30:34.34
Houston's blood[br]was all over it.

01:30:34.34,01:30:37.18
Well, shortly[br]before the homicide,

01:30:37.18,01:30:39.68
I had a checkup[br]on her vision,

01:30:39.68,01:30:43.62
and I found[br]that she was myopic.

01:30:43.62,01:30:44.82
It's nearsighted--

01:30:44.82,01:30:47.38
Nearsighted, but...[br]She could see.

01:30:48.39,01:30:49.38
Yes.

01:30:50.96,01:30:52.69
She said communism was...

01:30:52.69,01:30:54.68
better for human beings.

01:30:56.63,01:30:58.07
She had nothing[br]but contempt

01:30:58.07,01:31:00.20
for our great country[br]and its principles?

01:31:00.20,01:31:02.97
Apart from its musicals.[br]She said the American one...

01:31:02.97,01:31:04.57
the American ones[br]were better.

01:31:04.57,01:31:06.47
So...

01:31:06.47,01:31:08.64
the defendant[br]preferred Hollywood

01:31:08.64,01:31:10.20
to Vladivostok.

01:31:11.35,01:31:14.08
I suppose that's[br]an acknowledgement of sorts.

01:31:14.08,01:31:15.48
She just asked[br]many times

01:31:15.48,01:31:17.48
about the money.

01:31:17.48,01:31:19.59
She wanted to know[br]where it was?

01:31:19.59,01:31:20.89
That's right.

01:31:20.89,01:31:22.96
She asked you[br]about the gun?

01:31:22.96,01:31:24.73
Yes, she did.

01:31:24.73,01:31:27.19
She wanted to know[br]where it was kept?

01:31:27.19,01:31:29.16
That's right.

01:31:29.16,01:31:30.73
Bill was lying on the floor

01:31:30.73,01:31:33.63
and... he was wounded.

01:31:33.63,01:31:36.04
And...

01:31:36.04,01:31:38.14
And...

01:31:38.14,01:31:40.74
He was pleading for his life?

01:31:40.74,01:31:41.71
Yes.

01:31:41.71,01:31:44.14
"I--I beg you,[br]I beg you,

01:31:44.14,01:31:45.28
I beg you."

01:31:45.28,01:31:48.65
You showed him[br]no mercy, Selma!

01:31:54.35,01:31:57.69
You shall have[br]no mercy either!

01:31:59.56,01:32:02.79
Would you state your name[br]for the record, please?

01:32:05.73,01:32:08.06
Selma Jezkova.

01:32:09.30,01:32:13.11
And Bill and[br]Linda Houston...

01:32:13.11,01:32:15.04
were your friends,[br]is that right?

01:32:18.65,01:32:19.65
Yeah.

01:32:19.65,01:32:21.55
In fact, you lived[br]in a trailer

01:32:21.55,01:32:23.52
on their property.

01:32:27.39,01:32:28.86
Yeah.

01:32:28.86,01:32:30.76
And didn't they also

01:32:30.76,01:32:32.43
take care[br]of your young son

01:32:32.43,01:32:34.22
when you were at work?

01:32:39.27,01:32:40.32
Yeah.

01:32:42.50,01:32:43.67
They bought him a...

01:32:43.67,01:32:46.31
birthday present[br]recently.

01:32:46.31,01:32:47.64
Is that right?

01:32:52.11,01:32:54.24
Yeah. They[br]got him a bike.

01:32:56.22,01:32:59.19
Right.

01:32:59.19,01:33:01.79
Your sight[br]was poor,

01:33:01.79,01:33:03.89
you claim,[br]contrary to

01:33:03.89,01:33:06.38
the expert testimony[br]we have received.

01:33:07.79,01:33:10.53
But you saw[br]well enough

01:33:10.53,01:33:14.09
to inflict 34 wounds[br]on Bill Houston.

01:33:15.70,01:33:18.26
So why did you[br]kill him, actually?

01:33:19.71,01:33:21.73
If I may be[br]so bold to ask?

01:33:28.18,01:33:29.91
He asked me to.

01:33:31.39,01:33:33.09
He did?

01:33:33.09,01:33:34.66
How intriguing.

01:33:34.66,01:33:36.42
A man with[br]a fine career

01:33:36.42,01:33:39.26
and some wealth,[br]a happy marriage,

01:33:39.26,01:33:41.23
why would[br]this Bill Houston

01:33:41.23,01:33:42.75
ask you to kill him?

01:33:48.50,01:33:50.54
I promised not to say.

01:33:50.54,01:33:53.74
Well, that clears[br]things up immensely.

01:33:53.74,01:33:56.68
You promised[br]you wouldn't say.

01:33:56.68,01:33:59.45
In that case, we'll just[br]have to take your word for it

01:33:59.45,01:34:02.15
when you say[br]that the money you stole

01:34:03.58,01:34:04.82
that Bill Houston's savings

01:34:04.82,01:34:06.95
also disappeared[br]so mysteriously

01:34:06.95,01:34:08.46
that same day.

01:34:08.46,01:34:10.72
Just, uh...

01:34:10.72,01:34:12.92
Just where did you[br]get your money?

01:34:17.10,01:34:18.36
Well...

01:34:20.03,01:34:22.44
I'd been saving up.

01:34:22.44,01:34:26.21
Well, I suppose[br]you could call it that.

01:34:26.21,01:34:28.61
What were these savings[br]to be used for?

01:34:28.61,01:34:30.38
You never bought your son

01:34:30.38,01:34:32.31
so much as[br]a single birthday present,

01:34:32.31,01:34:34.11
as we've heard.

01:34:38.05,01:34:39.31
Yes?

01:34:41.15,01:34:43.42
My--my father.

01:34:43.42,01:34:46.05
In Czechoslovakia.

01:34:50.13,01:34:51.65
Your father?

01:34:53.80,01:34:55.34
And what,[br]pray tell...

01:34:55.34,01:34:56.77
is his name?

01:35:01.31,01:35:03.37
My--my father is...

01:35:06.11,01:35:08.68
Oldrich Novy.

01:35:08.68,01:35:09.81
So...

01:35:11.02,01:35:12.99
We're meant to believe...

01:35:12.99,01:35:14.89
that you killed[br]Bill Houston

01:35:14.89,01:35:16.82
by inflicting[br]34 wounds on him

01:35:16.82,01:35:19.43
because...

01:35:19.43,01:35:21.40
He asked you to.

01:35:21.40,01:35:24.16
Just as we're meant[br]to believe

01:35:24.16,01:35:26.10
that you were blind[br]when you did it...

01:35:26.10,01:35:30.24
Are meant to believe[br]that it was your own savings

01:35:30.24,01:35:32.07
that you stole from him...

01:35:32.07,01:35:33.54
Just as we're meant[br]to believe

01:35:33.54,01:35:35.68
that you sent all you had

01:35:35.68,01:35:37.54
to your father back home,

01:35:37.54,01:35:40.51
a man by the name[br]of Oldrich Novy.

01:35:41.62,01:35:42.95
Is that right?

01:35:47.42,01:35:49.01
Yes.

01:35:50.52,01:35:53.22
Thank you,[br]Miss Jezkova.

01:36:02.04,01:36:03.64
Ladies and gentlemen[br]of the jury,

01:36:03.64,01:36:06.54
you've now heard from[br]the defendant's own lips.

01:36:06.54,01:36:08.54
You must believe her,

01:36:08.54,01:36:11.08
just as you[br]must believe her

01:36:11.08,01:36:13.35
when she claims[br]her father's name

01:36:13.35,01:36:15.58
is Oldrich Novy.

01:36:16.82,01:36:18.69
Your Honor...

01:36:18.69,01:36:19.99
at this time,[br]the state calls

01:36:19.99,01:36:21.65
to the witness stand...

01:36:23.19,01:36:24.89
Oldrich Novy.

01:36:35.20,01:36:37.07
Please state[br]your full name.

01:36:37.07,01:36:39.57
The name is[br]Oldrich Novy.

01:36:39.57,01:36:43.27
And you used to live[br]in Czechoslovakia?

01:36:44.28,01:36:45.68
That is right.

01:36:45.68,01:36:48.18
I live now in California,[br]as you know.

01:36:48.18,01:36:50.45
That's right, that's[br]where we found you.

01:36:50.45,01:36:53.65
What exactly is[br]your relationship

01:36:53.65,01:36:55.48
with the defendant?

01:36:59.96,01:37:01.76
I do not know her.

01:37:03.20,01:37:05.10
You don't know her?

01:37:05.10,01:37:06.37
So...

01:37:06.37,01:37:08.94
You have not received money

01:37:08.94,01:37:10.44
from her.

01:37:10.44,01:37:11.87
Money that--that...

01:37:11.87,01:37:14.31
she says was so dearly earned?

01:37:15.68,01:37:17.01
No, I have not.

01:37:17.01,01:37:19.04
Perhaps you're[br]not her father then?

01:37:20.31,01:37:21.88
No, I am not.

01:37:21.88,01:37:23.52
Well, if[br]this relationship

01:37:23.52,01:37:26.59
was made up[br]by the defendant,

01:37:26.59,01:37:27.89
then...

01:37:27.89,01:37:28.96
can you think[br]of any way

01:37:28.96,01:37:31.53
she might've come[br]to know your name?

01:37:31.53,01:37:35.16
I was once well known[br]in Czechoslovakia

01:37:35.16,01:37:37.90
uh... because of my profession.

01:37:37.90,01:37:40.87
Yes, Mr. Oldrich Novy,[br]what is your profession?

01:37:40.87,01:37:42.87
Maybe that can give us[br]a clue to why,

01:37:42.87,01:37:45.34
why this somewhat...[br]romantic,

01:37:45.34,01:37:47.51
certainly communistic, woman

01:37:47.51,01:37:50.48
who worships Fred Astaire[br]but not his country,

01:37:50.48,01:37:52.48
why she might've lied...

01:37:52.48,01:37:54.65
and misused your name...

01:37:54.65,01:37:57.88
to make us think[br]all her money was spent

01:37:57.88,01:38:01.29
on a poor father[br]and not on her own vanity.

01:38:01.29,01:38:02.46
What is it that you do?

01:38:02.46,01:38:05.66
I was an actor.[br]I made films.

01:38:05.66,01:38:07.96
They were musicals.

01:39:54.87,01:39:56.50
Say it again!

01:41:18.79,01:41:21.12
Will the court please rise?

01:41:23.19,01:41:26.28
The honorable Judge[br]A.D. Mantle presiding.

01:41:37.50,01:41:39.56
Have you reached a verdict?

01:41:41.34,01:41:42.57
Yes, Your Honor.

01:42:01.86,01:42:04.69
Will the defendant[br]please rise?

01:42:14.87,01:42:17.11
We, the jury,[br]find the defendant

01:42:17.11,01:42:19.15
Selma Jezkova

01:42:19.15,01:42:21.08
guilty of murder[br]in the first degree

01:42:21.08,01:42:24.15
and hereby sentence her[br]to death.

01:42:24.15,01:42:26.89
Is this[br]the verdict of this jury?

01:42:26.89,01:42:30.56
You fully understand[br]that it must be unanimous?

01:42:30.56,01:42:32.96
We do, Your Honor.

01:42:32.96,01:42:35.40
Selma Jezkova...

01:42:35.40,01:42:37.80
You are hereby sentenced

01:42:37.80,01:42:39.90
to be taken from this place

01:42:39.90,01:42:42.40
and confined in[br]the state penitentiary

01:42:42.40,01:42:45.71
until such time[br]as you shall be executed

01:42:45.71,01:42:48.47
by being hanged[br]by the neck

01:42:48.47,01:42:50.14
until you are dead.

01:42:50.14,01:42:51.81
This court is adjourned.

01:42:51.81,01:42:53.34
All rise!

01:43:11.30,01:43:13.67
I've just heard[br]about the...

01:43:13.67,01:43:16.27
Supreme Court decision.

01:43:16.27,01:43:18.00
Yeah, l...

01:43:18.00,01:43:20.84
I just want to talk[br]practical stuff.

01:43:25.14,01:43:27.48
On Gene's birthday...

01:43:29.78,01:43:33.15
he will receive[br]a letter.

01:43:33.15,01:43:35.39
And it's so important,[br]Kathy...

01:43:35.39,01:43:38.32
that he reads it[br]really carefully.

01:43:38.32,01:43:41.56
I need you to take care[br]of that for me...

01:43:41.56,01:43:43.63
because I'm not[br]gonna be there

01:43:43.63,01:43:45.70
when he gets it.

01:43:45.70,01:43:47.23
He should not be afraid,

01:43:47.23,01:43:50.00
because there's nothing[br]to be afraid of, Kathy.

01:43:50.00,01:43:54.01
Listen, Gene wants[br]to see you so badly.

01:43:54.01,01:43:56.53
Won't you let him?[br]Please?

01:44:00.21,01:44:02.11
There's nothing[br]for him to see.

01:44:04.68,01:44:06.58
He's got you now,[br]Kathy.

01:44:09.76,01:44:12.33
And there's[br]one more thing:

01:44:12.33,01:44:15.06
He has to[br]call himself Novy.

01:44:15.06,01:44:16.93
That's[br]very important.

01:44:16.93,01:44:19.60
All right,[br]time's up, Selma.

01:44:19.60,01:44:21.57
I know that sounds[br]a bit foolish.

01:44:21.57,01:44:23.57
Novy?

01:44:23.57,01:44:24.97
I'm sorry I didn't[br]tell you before

01:44:24.97,01:44:27.01
about all this.[br]I just didn't dare to

01:44:27.01,01:44:29.84
because they would[br]ruin everything.

01:44:29.84,01:44:31.21
But what--[br]Why does he

01:44:31.21,01:44:32.95
have to call himself Novy?

01:44:32.95,01:44:35.05
Stop asking questions[br]like that, Cvalda.

01:44:35.05,01:44:37.98
Please... Iet me[br]tell Gene hello...

01:44:37.98,01:44:39.28
from you to him.

01:44:41.05,01:44:42.42
No.

01:45:02.18,01:45:03.94
I know you love[br]your son very much.

01:45:05.88,01:45:07.68
I love him very much.

01:45:11.38,01:45:13.85
Got a boy of my own[br]back home.

01:45:19.33,01:45:21.82
You never told me that.

01:45:27.57,01:45:28.87
Good night, Brenda.

01:45:28.87,01:45:30.07
Good night.

01:45:30.07,01:45:32.00
Say hi to your son[br]from me.

01:45:34.61,01:45:35.84
Thank you, Selma.

01:46:33.43,01:46:34.83
Can I help you?

01:46:35.84,01:46:38.17
Did you once have[br]a patient called...

01:46:38.17,01:46:41.11
Jezkova...

01:46:41.11,01:46:44.58
Selma Jezkova?

01:46:44.58,01:46:46.05
Well, if it wasn't[br]too long ago,

01:46:46.05,01:46:47.95
I can check[br]my records for you.

01:46:50.72,01:46:52.65
Jes... Jez... Jess...

01:46:53.65,01:46:55.75
Sorry, there's no one[br]here by that name.

01:47:02.56,01:47:04.19
What about Novy?

01:47:05.80,01:47:08.13
I have good news for you.

01:47:08.13,01:47:09.30
What's that?

01:47:09.30,01:47:10.50
We found a new lawyer...

01:47:10.50,01:47:13.84
and he's going to get[br]your case re-opened.

01:47:13.84,01:47:16.60
He says your lawyer[br]was incompetent.

01:47:19.01,01:47:20.38
What do you mean?

01:47:22.58,01:47:24.71
Well, the case is[br]going to be re-opened.

01:47:26.25,01:47:28.05
You won't get[br]the death sentence.

01:47:30.29,01:47:31.92
Is that true?

01:47:31.92,01:47:34.62
Yes. New information[br]has turned up.

01:47:35.80,01:47:37.36
Wh-what information?

01:47:37.36,01:47:39.40
Well, we know[br]the whole story, Selma.

01:47:39.40,01:47:42.14
Why didn't you tell us[br]anything?

01:47:42.14,01:47:43.84
You know, about...

01:47:43.84,01:47:46.00
about the money[br]for Gene's operation.

01:47:49.51,01:47:51.78
How did you find out?

01:47:51.78,01:47:53.71
Well, Jeff talked[br]to the doctor.

01:47:55.88,01:47:57.94
Does--does Gene know?

01:48:00.49,01:48:01.95
I mean,[br]have you told Gene?

01:48:03.06,01:48:05.59
No.[br]No, I didn't.

01:48:05.59,01:48:07.79
But you've got[br]a much better case now.

01:48:07.79,01:48:09.89
That's very important,[br]Kathy.

01:48:12.10,01:48:14.73
His eyes might get[br]worse from worrying,

01:48:14.73,01:48:16.73
and then the operation[br]won't work.

01:48:17.84,01:48:19.61
Yes, but, Selma...

01:48:19.61,01:48:21.54
Don't you see[br]that it would help you

01:48:21.54,01:48:23.98
if they knew that you[br]were trying to save your son

01:48:23.98,01:48:25.31
from going blind?

01:48:26.38,01:48:28.21
The lawyer,[br]he'll come and see you

01:48:28.21,01:48:30.35
in two weeks' time.

01:48:30.35,01:48:31.38
Kathy, but, uh...

01:48:31.38,01:48:33.19
You know[br]they're hanging me

01:48:33.19,01:48:34.19
in one week.

01:48:34.19,01:48:35.56
We know that,[br]but he says

01:48:35.56,01:48:37.22
you can apply for a stay.

01:48:37.22,01:48:39.66
You know, most cases[br]get one the first time.

01:48:43.36,01:48:45.02
Well, you can smile.

01:48:46.43,01:48:48.13
Selma...

01:48:48.13,01:48:50.83
Yeah... it's just[br]too much for me.

01:48:54.21,01:48:55.68
I thought[br]I was strong.

01:48:55.68,01:48:57.94
I just can't[br]take it, Kathy.

01:48:57.94,01:49:00.64
Apply for a stay.

01:49:12.76,01:49:14.52
What if they[br]don't phone?

01:49:16.76,01:49:20.70
Uh, well, you'll be[br]transferred to the other...

01:49:20.70,01:49:23.00
cell block[br]at some point tomorrow.

01:49:25.81,01:49:28.74
That's the cell block[br]where they hang people.

01:49:32.55,01:49:35.21
Yeah,[br]that's where they...

01:49:35.21,01:49:38.02
spend the last day.

01:49:38.02,01:49:41.22
And then they do[br]their 1 07 steps.

01:49:41.22,01:49:44.32
It's from that room...

01:49:44.32,01:49:46.19
to the gallows,[br]isn't it?

01:49:48.19,01:49:51.03
That's what they say,[br]Selma, but...

01:49:51.03,01:49:52.40
Look at...

01:49:52.40,01:49:54.27
You're gonna get[br]your stay.

01:49:54.27,01:49:56.77
Why don't you try to[br]think of something nice,

01:49:56.77,01:49:57.86
all right?

01:50:01.41,01:50:03.74
It's just[br]so quiet here.

01:50:06.18,01:50:08.24
What's that got[br]to do with it, Selma?

01:50:13.05,01:50:16.42
You know, when I used[br]to work in the factory...

01:50:18.36,01:50:21.73
I used to dream[br]that I was in a musical,

01:50:21.73,01:50:23.26
because, in a musical,

01:50:23.26,01:50:26.20
nothing dreadful[br]ever happens.

01:50:30.34,01:50:32.46
But it's so quiet here.

01:50:34.97,01:50:37.78
Don't the prisoners[br]march or something?

01:50:37.78,01:50:38.94
March?[br]No.

01:50:38.94,01:50:40.01
Yeah?

01:50:40.01,01:50:40.85
No, they don't.[br]They don't...

01:50:40.85,01:50:43.02
There's not...

01:50:43.02,01:50:44.68
There's not much noise[br]around here, Selma,

01:50:44.68,01:50:45.74
I know.

01:50:48.42,01:50:51.52
But later they[br]turn on the radio.

01:50:51.52,01:50:53.76
No, no, no.[br]There's no...

01:50:53.76,01:50:56.82
They don't allow radio[br]in the isolation block.

01:50:57.93,01:51:01.53
But I've been listening[br]to the ventilation...

01:51:01.53,01:51:03.64
shaft.

01:51:03.64,01:51:05.87
I hear sometimes[br]people singing there,

01:51:05.87,01:51:08.14
Iike...

01:51:08.14,01:51:09.30
hymns or...

01:51:10.61,01:51:12.04
That's not[br]against the rules,

01:51:12.04,01:51:13.94
to listen, is it?

01:51:15.61,01:51:16.98
No.

01:51:16.98,01:51:18.71
I wonder if...

01:51:20.29,01:51:22.02
if maybe you're[br]hearing the singing

01:51:22.02,01:51:23.56
coming from the chapel.

01:51:23.56,01:51:24.72
Yeah?

01:51:27.53,01:51:29.46
Maybe you'll[br]even get a sermon.

01:55:24.40,01:55:26.80
Selma...

01:55:26.80,01:55:28.46
Selma...

01:55:29.67,01:55:31.77
You got your stay.

01:55:31.77,01:55:33.50
You got the stay.

01:55:36.41,01:55:37.93
I'm so happy for you.

01:55:52.89,01:55:54.83
I'm your new legal counsel.

01:55:54.83,01:55:56.53
My name is Luke, okay?

01:55:56.53,01:55:58.50
Oh, hi, Luke.

01:55:58.50,01:56:01.50
I'm, uh, quite sure...

01:56:01.50,01:56:03.33
I can get your sentence[br]commuted.

01:56:04.30,01:56:05.90
All I need is a signature

01:56:05.90,01:56:08.91
stating you want[br]the case re-opened...

01:56:08.91,01:56:10.88
and then I can get[br]all the paperwork ready

01:56:10.88,01:56:12.57
by tomorrow.

01:56:15.35,01:56:16.55
Yeah.

01:56:16.55,01:56:19.35
There's a lot of things[br]your other lawyer didn't do

01:56:19.35,01:56:21.12
that I'm going to do.

01:56:21.12,01:56:23.22
A lot of ground[br]that wasn't covered

01:56:23.22,01:56:25.22
that I am going[br]to cover.

01:56:25.22,01:56:27.43
The fact that you were[br]fighting for your boy

01:56:27.43,01:56:29.40
is something[br]we can really milk.

01:56:29.40,01:56:33.53
I have some experience[br]in cases like this, so...

01:56:34.60,01:56:36.87
That's what[br]the attorney before said.

01:56:36.87,01:56:37.93
Uh... yeah.

01:56:39.17,01:56:43.14
You see, he was[br]appointed by the court,

01:56:43.14,01:56:45.24
and you don't get[br]the best legal counsel

01:56:45.24,01:56:46.35
that way.

01:56:46.35,01:56:48.98
Y-You were not[br]appointed by the court?

01:56:48.98,01:56:51.48
I'm not appointed[br]by the court, no.

01:56:51.48,01:56:53.18
You're gonna have[br]to pay me.

01:56:56.99,01:56:59.66
But... not to worry.

01:56:59.66,01:57:00.66
Yeah?

01:57:00.66,01:57:02.09
That's been[br]taken care of.

01:57:02.09,01:57:05.06
I made a deal with[br]your... Iady friend?

01:57:05.06,01:57:06.27
Deal?

01:57:06.27,01:57:09.33
Yeah, in regard[br]to my fee.

01:57:09.33,01:57:11.64
I've agreed to[br]accept the amount

01:57:11.64,01:57:14.11
that she said[br]she could raise.

01:57:23.58,01:57:25.11
How much...

01:57:26.49,01:57:27.89
How much was it?

01:57:27.89,01:57:29.49
Well, I can tell you[br]precisely,

01:57:29.49,01:57:30.72
because I received[br]an envelope.

01:57:30.72,01:57:33.19
It's, uh,[br]two thousand dollars--

01:57:33.19,01:57:37.43
$2,056.1 0?

01:57:37.43,01:57:39.45
That's it precisely.

01:57:41.50,01:57:44.03
Now...

01:57:46.04,01:57:48.34
There's something here.

01:57:49.88,01:57:54.01
I'd like to just sort of[br]go over our tactics.

01:57:54.01,01:57:56.72
I have a couple of[br]questions to ask you.

01:57:56.72,01:57:58.62
If he doesn't have[br]the operation next month,

01:57:58.62,01:58:00.05
it's gonna be too late!

01:58:00.05,01:58:02.69
And he will never[br]be able to see!

01:58:02.69,01:58:04.92
This is what[br]it's all about,

01:58:04.92,01:58:06.66
so he can see[br]his grandchildren!

01:58:06.66,01:58:08.86
Well, let me[br]tell you something.

01:58:08.86,01:58:10.10
The only thing[br]that's important to me

01:58:10.10,01:58:12.00
in my whole life,

01:58:12.00,01:58:14.20
and you don't[br]understand, Kathy!

01:58:14.20,01:58:15.83
- Listen to me![br]- It's just plain stupidity!

01:58:15.83,01:58:17.47
- Listen to me![br]- Waste that kind of money...

01:58:17.47,01:58:19.34
on a blind woman[br]who's gonna spend

01:58:19.34,01:58:20.91
the rest of her life[br]in jail!

01:58:20.91,01:58:22.31
But he needs his mother,[br]you know,

01:58:22.31,01:58:23.31
alive,[br]no matter where!

01:58:23.31,01:58:24.91
You don't understand!

01:58:24.91,01:58:26.18
He needs his eyes!

01:58:26.18,01:58:27.61
- He needs his mother![br]- No!

01:58:27.61,01:58:29.62
- Yes! Alive![br]- No!

01:58:29.62,01:58:31.45
Listen to reason[br]for once!

01:58:31.45,01:58:32.75
Selma.

01:58:33.85,01:58:34.95
Selma.

01:58:34.95,01:58:36.86
I listen to my heart.

01:58:36.86,01:58:39.19
I will go to the police.[br]I will tell them that...

01:58:39.19,01:58:41.42
you stole the money[br]from... from Bill.

01:58:42.73,01:58:44.10
Oh, yes,[br]I will tell that.

01:58:44.10,01:58:46.10
I will[br]tell them that,

01:58:46.10,01:58:47.47
that you stole it[br]from Bill,

01:58:47.47,01:58:49.47
and you will never see[br]the money again!

01:58:49.47,01:58:51.74
That will be gone[br]for good.

01:58:51.74,01:58:55.07
No operation! Nothing![br]No mother! Nothing!

01:59:04.42,01:59:07.29
You can have[br]your money back.

01:59:07.29,01:59:08.22
I just want[br]to make sure

01:59:08.22,01:59:11.66
that you fully comprehend

01:59:11.66,01:59:14.56
what this means,[br]this decision.

01:59:14.56,01:59:15.56
Yeah.

01:59:15.56,01:59:16.90
You fully realize[br]what will happen?

01:59:16.90,01:59:18.00
Yeah.

01:59:18.00,01:59:21.27
I already asked[br]for no more stays.

01:59:21.27,01:59:23.17
Once this starts,[br]there's no stopping it.

01:59:23.17,01:59:24.50
You understand me?

01:59:25.54,01:59:26.83
Yeah.

01:59:28.74,01:59:30.30
I'm prepared.

01:59:40.42,01:59:42.61
Gene says thank you.

01:59:46.02,01:59:47.82
Thanks for what?

01:59:51.80,01:59:54.86
Oh, some comic books[br]on his birthday.

01:59:58.27,02:00:01.34
You can't buy him...[br]presents

02:00:01.34,02:00:04.51
and say it's from me.

02:00:04.51,02:00:06.84
You have to stop[br]doing that, Jeff.

02:00:07.88,02:00:10.47
Uh, maybe[br]you can just...

02:00:15.19,02:00:16.88
phone him.

02:00:18.69,02:00:21.89
Just say,[br]you know...

02:00:21.89,02:00:23.50
something to him.

02:00:23.50,02:00:25.83
No, that's--that's[br]not a good idea.

02:00:30.17,02:00:33.00
He wants to be the one...

02:00:34.54,02:00:37.60
who's allowed to be there[br]when it happens.

02:00:40.98,02:00:44.38
But l-- And then[br]they told him

02:00:44.38,02:00:45.82
he's too young.

02:00:48.79,02:00:51.76
Who put that crazy idea[br]into his head anyway?

02:00:54.29,02:00:55.82
I don't want him[br]to be there.

02:00:58.80,02:01:00.66
I'll be there[br]if you would.

02:01:02.80,02:01:04.67
And Kathy?

02:01:10.68,02:01:12.77
You know Kathy.[br]She's...

02:01:14.78,02:01:16.54
She's still angry.

02:01:18.75,02:01:21.31
If you think[br]you can take it...

02:01:24.32,02:01:26.26
I would love you[br]to be there.

02:01:33.80,02:01:36.57
Don't cry, Jeff.

02:01:36.57,02:01:39.06
Jeff, don't cry.[br]It's gonna be fine.

02:01:41.34,02:01:42.71
Jeff.

02:01:52.68,02:01:54.52
Why did you have him?

02:01:56.19,02:01:58.95
You knew he would have[br]the same disease as you.

02:02:09.27,02:02:12.13
I just wanted to hold[br]a little baby...

02:02:16.68,02:02:18.37
just in my arms.

02:02:25.45,02:02:26.94
I love you.

02:02:59.05,02:03:00.99
It's time, Selma.

02:03:27.71,02:03:29.27
Okay?

02:03:32.25,02:03:33.68
Okay.

02:04:53.80,02:04:55.53
Your meal, Jezkova.

02:06:01.73,02:06:04.14
Selma Jezkova...

02:06:04.14,02:06:05.36
It's time.

02:06:24.32,02:06:25.85
Please stand.

02:06:27.99,02:06:29.89
She can walk on her own.

02:06:34.23,02:06:36.37
Selma...

02:06:36.37,02:06:40.27
I'm afraid my legs[br]aren't working very well.

02:06:40.27,02:06:42.07
You can do it, Selma.

02:06:42.07,02:06:43.14
Yeah.

02:06:43.14,02:06:44.28
I have a plan, okay?

02:06:44.28,02:06:45.47
Yeah.

02:06:46.95,02:06:48.51
You're gonna[br]stand up with me.

02:06:48.51,02:06:49.54
Yeah.

02:06:51.12,02:06:52.28
I may make some noise.

02:06:54.52,02:06:56.19
It will give you[br]something to listen to.

02:06:56.19,02:06:57.09
Yeah.

02:06:57.09,02:06:58.08
Listen.

02:07:03.73,02:07:06.87
There's 1 07 steps.

02:07:06.87,02:07:08.37
Selma, listen[br]to the mark.

02:07:08.37,02:07:09.83
I couldn't even do one.

02:07:09.83,02:07:11.07
You can do it.

02:07:11.07,02:07:14.27
I can't do it!

02:07:14.27,02:07:15.93
Now listen, Selma.

02:07:17.01,02:07:19.44
I want you to do[br]one--there, one.

02:07:21.78,02:07:23.72
Come on.

02:07:23.72,02:07:24.88
Listen.

02:07:26.85,02:07:28.11
Two.

02:07:29.82,02:07:31.32
Three...

02:07:31.32,02:07:32.32
four...

02:07:32.32,02:07:34.76

02:07:36.66,02:07:38.70
nine... ten...

02:07:38.70,02:07:41.83
1 1 ... 1 2... 1 3...

02:07:41.83,02:07:43.80
1 4... 1 5...

02:07:43.80,02:07:46.57
1 6... 1 7... 1 8...

02:07:46.57,02:07:48.94
1 9... 20...

02:07:48.94,02:07:51.41
21 ... 22... 23...

02:07:51.41,02:07:53.78
24... 25...

02:07:53.78,02:07:56.72
26... 27... 28...

02:07:56.72,02:07:58.41
29... 30...

02:08:06.29,02:08:08.12
39... 40...

02:08:10.76,02:08:13.13
43... 44... 45...

02:08:23.11,02:08:24.51
55... 56...

02:08:28.05,02:08:30.24
60... 61 ... 62...

02:08:38.06,02:08:40.52
70... 71 ... 72...

02:08:42.46,02:08:45.83
75... 76... 77...

02:09:02.91,02:09:05.18
93... 94... 95...

02:09:11.56,02:09:13.86
1 04... 1 05...

02:09:13.86,02:09:15.26
1 06...

02:09:15.26,02:09:17.50
1 07.

02:09:17.50,02:09:19.20
Selma Jezkova,

02:09:19.20,02:09:20.66
do you have[br]any last words?

02:09:25.97,02:09:27.70
Very well.[br]Proceed.

02:09:37.18,02:09:38.71
Selma.

02:09:40.32,02:09:42.08
Selma, you okay?

02:09:45.69,02:09:46.92
It's okay.[br]It's okay.

02:09:50.90,02:09:52.93
Come on now.

02:09:52.93,02:09:54.10
Use the board.

02:09:54.10,02:09:55.63
Oh, no, no. No, wait.[br]Give her a chance.

02:09:55.63,02:09:57.33
She can stand up.[br]She can stand.

02:10:12.42,02:10:13.38
In here.

02:10:13.38,02:10:16.82
It's okay.[br]It's okay.

02:10:16.82,02:10:18.32
It's okay.

02:10:18.32,02:10:20.22
It's okay.

02:10:22.83,02:10:24.86
It's okay.

02:10:24.86,02:10:25.76
The straps[br]on her hands.

02:10:25.76,02:10:27.03
I'm scared.

02:10:27.03,02:10:28.20
It's okay.

02:10:28.20,02:10:29.86
- I'm so scared![br]- I know.

02:10:37.34,02:10:38.71
On the mark.

02:10:47.39,02:10:48.75
No!

02:10:48.75,02:10:50.26
I can't do the hood!

02:10:50.26,02:10:52.22
It's okay.[br]Selma.

02:10:52.22,02:10:54.03
I have to breathe!

02:10:54.03,02:10:55.79
Nobody told me[br]about the hood!

02:10:55.79,02:10:57.83
It's just so[br]you can't see, Selma.

02:10:57.83,02:10:59.26
- I can't breathe![br]- I know.

02:10:59.26,02:11:00.67
I can't breathe!

02:11:00.67,02:11:02.43
- Look, look--[br]- I can't breathe!

02:11:02.43,02:11:03.57
I have to breathe!

02:11:03.57,02:11:04.26
Look,[br]she can't breathe.

02:11:05.34,02:11:07.44
She can't breathe![br]She can't--

02:11:07.44,02:11:09.47
I'm taking it.[br]I'm taking it.

02:11:09.47,02:11:11.48
This is irregular.

02:11:11.48,02:11:13.24
I don't care[br]if it's irregular.

02:11:13.24,02:11:14.31
- We have regulations.[br]- She's blind--

02:11:14.31,02:11:16.01
I don't care about[br]the regulations!

02:11:16.01,02:11:17.05
The girl is blind,[br]for Christ's sake.

02:11:17.05,02:11:18.25
I'm gonna make a call.

02:11:18.25,02:11:20.08
Yeah, make the call--

02:11:22.62,02:11:23.66
Gene...

02:11:23.66,02:11:25.89
Yeah, we[br]have a situation here.

02:11:25.89,02:11:27.32
I'll hold for him.

02:11:28.33,02:11:29.39
Gene...

02:11:29.39,02:11:30.90
The woman's blind...[br]I'll wait.

02:11:30.90,02:11:33.10
Gene...

02:11:33.10,02:11:34.06
Gene...

02:11:36.23,02:11:37.60
Waiting for a call.

02:11:37.60,02:11:39.57
Gene...

02:11:48.21,02:11:49.54
Gene!

02:11:49.75,02:11:51.08
Gene!

02:11:54.22,02:11:55.32
Gene!

02:11:55.32,02:11:57.56
He--he's just outside.

02:11:57.56,02:11:59.42
He gave me these[br]for you.

02:11:59.42,02:12:00.86
Guard.

02:12:00.86,02:12:02.49
So he had the operation?

02:12:02.49,02:12:05.43
He will see[br]his grandchildren!

02:12:05.43,02:12:07.09
He is just outside.

02:12:08.13,02:12:09.39
You were right, Selma!
