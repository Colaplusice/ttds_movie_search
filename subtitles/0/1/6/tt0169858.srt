NEON GENESIS

5
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,670
Sections 1 and 2 of the east complex will be closed at 18:00 today.

6
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,530
Please finish the
replacement by 16:30.

7
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,550
Both Misato and
Ayanami scare me.

8
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,700
Help me...

9
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,920
Help me, Asuka.

10
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,900
Hey, wake up.

11
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,600
Hey.

12
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,340
Open your eyes.

13
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,050
Hey, hey...

14
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,300
Asuka...

15
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,300
...Asuka...

16
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,100
Asuka!

17
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,430
Help me.

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,050
Help me.

19
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,430
Help me.

20
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,600
Help me.

21
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,630
Why don't you make fun
of me like you used to?

22
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,200
Hey!

23
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,700
I'm so disgusting.

24
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,100
Episode 25'

25
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,030
All doorways to our main
facilities are closed?

26
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,430
And we're in the
`ffirst alert" mode?

27
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,500
Why?

28
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,080
He was the last
Angel, wasn't he?

29
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,110
Yes, all the Angels
were supposedly destroyed.

30
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,800
Aren't we finally at peace?

31
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,920
So what's going to happen
to this place and the Evas?

32
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,660
And Ritsuko
isn't around.

33
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,840
I think Nerv
will be disbanded.

34
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,700
I have no idea what
lies ahead for us.

35
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,800
We have to put up with it until the Instrumentality Project begins.

36
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,900
Humans are incomplete...

37
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:34,920
...and they must become independent life forms by means of the Instrumentality Project...

38
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,120
Sounds like
an ideal world.

39
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,780
The Committee will use the Eva instead of Adam and Nerv to realize it.

40
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,150
Just as
Kaji expected.

41
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,610
The promised
time has come.

42
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,500
We've lost the
Longinus Lance...

43
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,510
...so we can't use Lillith
to proceed with the project.

44
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:59,050
We expect you to carry out the project using a duplicate of Lillith, Eva Unit 01.

45
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,190
That's different
from Seele's scenario.

46
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,110
Humans exist to
create Eva.

47
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,500
Humans should evolve
into a new form.

48
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,940
That's what the
Eva series is for.

49
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,950
We don't have to give up being human
to cling to an ark called Eva.

50
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:22,520
This is only a rite of passage for humanity at an impasse to rebirth.

51
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,890
A fated destruction will lead to the pleasure of resurrection.

52
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:31,500
In order for God, humanity and all life forms to unite as one someday...

53
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,860
Death won't
create anything.

54
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,540
You all
deserve death.

55
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,540
The meaning of humanity
is their wish to survive.

56
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,000
That's the hope of the woman who willingly stayed inside the Eva.

57
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,600
I see. That's the true objective of the Second Impact.

58
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,400
Was I noticed?!

59
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,900
No, that's not it.

60
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,900
It's the beginning.

61
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,040
The sixth network
is down!

62
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,980
Switch the left to an
emergency blue connection!

63
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,850
You can open
the satellite.

64
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,090
Yes. ~~What about
the right one?

65
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,600
All outside network links have been disconnected from the other side.

66
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,080
Is their
target Magi...?

67
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,250
Data is coming in from
all external terminals.

68
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,250
They're attempting
to hack into Magi.

69
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,570
As I thought.

70
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,020
Is Magi-2 in Matsushiro
the only invader?

71
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,400
No!~~At least five of the
Magi types are invading!

72
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,430
I can confirm the invasion from Germany, China and America!

73
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,250
Seele is using
its full potential.

74
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,560
The power balance
is 5 to 1.

75
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,250
We are at
a disadvantage.

76
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,250
The fourth defensive
shield has fallen.

77
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,260
I'm closing the
main database.

78
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,400
It didn't work!
I can't stop their advance!

79
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,450
It has entered the outer shell.
The backup system is inoperative.

80
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,310
This is bad. The seizure of Magi means the occupation of headquarters.

81
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,250
I know.

82
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,410
The independent defense
of Magi, right?

83
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,600
Yes, Lt Ibuki will explain at the second command center.

84
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,800
He's such an egoist, trying to use a woman he deserted.

85
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,840
Status?

86
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,250
Good morning.

87
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,270
A-801 was issued from
Tokyo-2 a while ago.

88
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,290
801?

89
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:36,750
Repeal of the privileged protection of Special Taskforce Nerv...

90
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,200
...and the transfer of command
to the Japanese government.

91
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,700
It's their
last notice.

92
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,100
Yes, that's right. ~~They're currently trying to hack into Magi.

93
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,810
We're at
a disadvantage.

94
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,250
This is Ibuki.

95
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,310
Dr. Akagi has started working
on protective measures.

96
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,810
Ritsuko has...?

97
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,900
Am I doing
something silly?

98
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,690
Logic has no meaning in the relationship between a man and a woman.

99
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,600
Don't you think so...

100
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,870
...Mom?

101
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,330
Recovery of ground communication in Goura has been increased by 0.2 percent.

102
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,600
How much longer?

103
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,780
She seems to be finishing up.
It's just like Dr. Akagi.

104
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,850
Only an invasion
of Magi?

105
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,430
I don't think we'll
get off that easy.

106
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,780
The seizure of Magi
is just a prologue.

107
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:43,270
Their object is to seize headquarters and the remaining Eva units.

108
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,600
Yes, and we have both
Lillith and Adam, as well.

109
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,640
No wonder those
old men are so hasty.

110
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,450
The hacking of
Magi has stopped.

111
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,900
B-Danang type-M defense system is employed.

112
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,600
Invasion will be impossible for the next 60 days.

113
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,800
See you later, Mother.

114
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:18,130
Ikari used the 666 protection.
It's so hard to break through.

115
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,720
We'll have to give up
on the seizure of Magi.

116
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:29,300
We wanted this to be peacefully, but we'll have to occupy the headquarters directly.

117
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,320
Let's carry out the
mission as planned.

118
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,130
Radar sites No. 8 through 17
have been disabled!

119
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,980
A special taskforce battalion is advancing from the Goura defensive line.

120
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,640
Two battalions are approaching from Gotenba, as well.

121
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,260
Three aircraft squadrons
are approaching from Mishima.

122
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,410
Our last enemies
are humans, after all.

123
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,180
All personnel,
to first class battle stations.

124
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,840
Battle stations...?

125
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,800
Even though they
aren't Angels...

126
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,610
...but humans?

127
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,600
The other side doesn't
think that way.

128
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,690
What happened?!
Hey?!

129
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,500
What is it?

130
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,250
The south
hub station...

131
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,140
The 7th tunnel
was destroyed.

132
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,200
A fire has broken out
in west cargo bay 5.

133
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,080
The invaders have reached
the first level.

134
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,680
The units in the
west are decoys!

135
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,550
If their target is the Evas,
they'll try to kill the pilots first!

136
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,960
Put Shinji on standby
in Unit 01 immediately!

137
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,610
Okay.

138
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,400
Where's Asuka?

139
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,690
She's in hospital
room 303.

140
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,130
Very well.
Move her to Unit 02.

141
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,750
But she hasn't regained her
synchro rate with Unit 02 yet!

142
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,040
She will definitely be
killed if she stays there.

143
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,490
So hiding her in the Eva is the most certain way to protect her.

144
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,360
Roger.

145
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,000
Stop the treatment
of the pilot...

146
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,060
...and prepare for launch!

147
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,090
As soon as she gets onboard, hide Unit 02 at the bottom of the lake.

148
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,710
She'll be found soon, but it's a little better than the cage.

149
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,390
Where's Rei?

150
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,200
Unknown.
I can't find her.

151
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,350
She'll be killed.
Find her quickly.

152
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,800
Unit 02 has
been launched!

153
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,520
After going through route 8,
it will be positioned at 70 deep.

154
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,400
Launch Unit 01, and position
it inside the Geo Front...

155
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,540
We can't,
the pilot hasn't...

156
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,600
Oh, my god...

157
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,180
All gates of Central Dogma up to level 2 will be closed.

158
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,680
All noncombatants,
stand by at route 87.

159
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,090
The 3rd underground wall was destroyed.
They've advanced to the second level.

160
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,800
They've mobilized
a division.

161
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,360
The occupation of headquarters
is only a matter of time.

162
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,470
Professor Fuyutsuki,
please take care of the rest.

163
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,800
I know.

164
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,340
Say hello
to Yui.

165
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,470
The second group
isn't responding!

166
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,760
Communications with the 77th
computer room has been cut off.

167
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,790
The 52nd linear rail
was destroyed.

168
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:36,300
They're so annoying.
I would've preferred Angels.

169
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,150
It can't be helped.
We're not used to killing humans.

170
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,270
Cut the red
cables first.

171
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,900
Invaders on level 3,
block-M.

172
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,350
We can't stop them!

173
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,140
From block-F, also. The main bypass was broken through by force.

174
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,670
Abandon everything down to level 3!
All combatants, withdraw!

175
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,400
Inject Bakelite into all routes
and pipes up to section 803!

176
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,040
Okay.

177
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,200
30 seconds to complete the injection
of Bakelite into section 703.

178
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,350
20 seconds to complete the injection
of Bakelite into section 737.

179
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,700
We should be able to
hold out a little longer.

180
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,500
Major Katsuragi, route 47 was destroyed,
and group 3 has been pinned down!

181
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,100
At this rate, Shinji...

182
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,180
Prevent the noncombatants from
engaging in hand to hand combat.

183
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,300
These guys
are pros.

184
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,300
If the group can't return to Dogma,
it would be better to surrender.

185
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,600
Sorry, I have to leave
the rest to you.

186
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,460
Okay.

187
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,520
Forget about Mt. Futago.
Hurry to block off the Nagao Pass.

188
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,320
It's taking longer
than expected.

189
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,700
We don't have
an easy job.

190
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,650
It's not fair.

191
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:06,600
We aren't equipped with effective anti-personnel weapons.

192
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,720
We're only equipped to
handle terrorists at most.

193
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,140
If the tactical defense force is fully mobilized, this place won't even last for a second.

194
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,500
Come to think of it...

195
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,190
...foreseeing this, the budget cut on dealing with invaders might have been decided.

196
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,160
Now that you
mention it...

197
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,310
Release the safety.

198
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,390
I... I can't shoot guns.

199
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,670
You've done it in
training many times!

200
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,340
But those
weren't humans!

201
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,450
You fool!

202
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,600
If you don't shoot,
you'll die!

203
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,810
Rei...

204
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,530
You're here,
after all.

205
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,640
The promised time has come.
Let's go.

206
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,250
The second level is
completely secured, over.

207
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,600
The original Magi at the second command center hasn't been seized yet.

208
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,950
Fighting at the left
wing on the lower level...

209
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:39,600
Carry out the heat dissolution
procedure immediately.

210
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,700
As soon as you find
the Eva pilots, kill them.

211
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,110
You're also allowed
to shoot noncombatants.

212
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,450
Yanagihara and Shinjo units,
enter the lower level, quickly.

213
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,300
I found the `TThird. "
Proceeding with termination.

214
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,850
Don't blame me, kid.

215
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,280
Don't blame me.

216
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,050
Let's go...

217
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:20,850
...to Unit 01.

218
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,600
The purple one
has been secured.

219
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,940
There was no problem
injecting the Bakelite.

220
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,600
The red one seems to have been taken out, and we're currently searching...

221
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,300
This isn't good.

222
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,500
They're attempting to physically
separate you from Unit 01.

223
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,800
There's no time
to lose.

224
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,360
Let's go, Shinji.

225
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,600
Choose whether you escape
here or get in Unit 01.

226
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,480
At this rate, you'll
die meaninglessly!

227
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,650
Help me, Asuka...

228
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,800
...help me.

229
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,990
You beg a girl for help at a time like this, and try to look away!

230
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,960
It's terrible to
be so indecisive!

231
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,800
Now, stand up!

232
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,590
Stand up!

233
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,050
No, I want
to die.

234
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,760
I don't want
to do anything.

235
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,730
Don't act like a child!
You're still alive, aren't you?

236
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,040
Then why don't you try
harder before you die?!

237
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,800
It's alright. Not this place, but separate Terminal Dogma first.

238
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:37,240
They've blown up so many places, but, as expected, they aren't doing that in here!

239
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,330
They probably want to finish it in one blow, but the original Magi is underneath us.

240
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,160
They want to try and
seize it intact, I guess.

241
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,590
But we're poorly equipped against biochemical weapons.

242
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,090
If they use them,
we're doomed.

243
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,590
And the N2 weapon, as well.

244
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,340
Speak of the devil...!

245
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,150
They aren't holding
back at all!

246
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,410
They're overdoing it.

247
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,530
Why do they want
the Eva so desperately?!

248
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,670
They're going to cause
the Third Impact...

249
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,780
...by using the Eva series
instead of an Angel.

250
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,560
The Second Impact, that occurred 15 years ago, was deliberately set by humans.

251
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:48,800
It was to reduce Adam to an egg to prevent the other Angels from causing a greater tragedy.

252
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,850
Shinji...

253
00:20:51,850 --> 00:21:00,880
...just like Adam, a lifeform called Lillith created us, the 18th Angels.

254
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,770
The remaining Angels
were other possibilities...

255
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,590
...that look different
from humans.

256
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:13,000
We were destined to hate each other even though we both are `hhuman. "

257
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:18,590
Listen, Shinji, destroy
all of the Eva series.

258
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,970
That will be the only
way for us to survive.

259
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,520
The phone doesn't
work anymore.

260
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,500
Nagano Prefecture New Tokyo-2

261
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,790
Prime Minister's Residence 3rd Office

262
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,350
No. We've confirmed explosions from ballistic missiles three minutes ago.

263
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:34,220
The Human Instrumentality Project that Nerv was secretly advancing...

264
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:40,790
...turned out to involve the Third Impact leading to the extinction of all human life.

265
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:45,250
I guess humans are the only
lifeforms that hate each other.

266
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,990
Now all that's left is to take care of the ruins of Nerv Headquarters.

267
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,970
Are you going to ask Germany or
China to help in reconstruction?

268
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,500
They'll knock
down the price.

269
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,150
So it will be closed for the next 20 years just like old Tokyo.

270
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:06,500
The heat on the surface has dropped. High pressure steam is no longer a problem.

271
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,600
All units are at
their initial positions.

272
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:13,190
Currently, up through level 3 of Dogma and the purple one are under our control.

273
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,730
What about
the red one?

274
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,800
It was found at the bottom of the underground lake, at 70.2 deep.

275
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,470
The condition of
the pilot is unknown.

276
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,690
I'm alive...

277
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,300
I don't want to die...

278
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,300
I don't want to die...

279
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:04,250
I don't want to die...

00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:08,500

00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,600
I don't want to die...

00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,000

284
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,300

I DON'T WANT TO DIE!

304
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,600
Stay alive.

305
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,550
You shouldn't die.

306
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,700
Stay alive.

307
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,230
You shouldn't die.

308
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,700
I won't let you die.

309
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,200

00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,300
You shouldn't die.

I won't let you die.

313
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,200
Please, die with me.

314
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,620
You shouldn't die.

315
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,300
Stay alive.

00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,600
Please, die with me!

317
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,720
Don't kill her!

318
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,000
Stay alive.

319
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,350
Mama, you're here!

320
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,050
Mama!

321
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,510
What the...?

322
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,390
Did we get it?

323
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,750
Mama...

324
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,780
Mama,
I understand...

325
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,970
...what the AT field is!

326
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,030
You're protecting me!

327
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,740
You're watching me!

328
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,090
You've been together with me from the beginning, Mama!

329
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,150
Eva Unit 02 activated!

330
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,120
Asuka's alright!
She's alive!

331
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,260
She is...?!

332
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,340
The cable!

333
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,680
Just concentrate on
its power cable!

334
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,640
Even if I don't have
the umbilical cable...

335
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,360
I've got 12,000 special
armor plates and...

336
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,580
...the AT field!

337
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,580
I won't lose...

338
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,700
...to you guys!

339
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:44,980
Eva, which should have been disabled,
is interfering with us again.

340
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:50,400
It takes poison to
quell poison, after all...

341
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,850
Eva series...?

342
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,910
Is it complete...?

343
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:34,510
They mobilized all nine of the units equipped with the S2 Organ...

344
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,050
It's too showy.

345
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,280
Are they going to
make it happen here?

346
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,300
Listen, Asuka...

347
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,230
...make sure to destroy all of the Eva series, alright?

348
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,820
I'll send Shinji out soon,
so hang in there.

349
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,930
So, emergency route 20 is open to get to Unit 01, right?

350
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,470
Yes, three power
lines are secured.

351
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:16,080
If you get there in 3 minutes,
you can head directly to cage 7.

352
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,480
Make sure to destroy
all of them...?

353
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
How could she be so harsh to someone who just got well?

354
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,550
Nine units in
3 and half minutes...

355
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:43,020
I only have
20 seconds for each.

356
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,840
That's one.

357
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,890
This is it.

358
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,660
I missed.

359
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,080
We failed to kill the target.
Request further instructions.

360
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,900
No need to pursue.
That place will be blown up.

361
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,490
Return immediately.

362
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,250
Roger.

363
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:38,670
I bought us
some time.

364
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,360
Don't worry.
It's not too serious.

365
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,440
The power is on.
You can go.

366
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:06,300
Listen, Shinji, you'll be
alone from this point on...

367
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,170
...so you'll have to decide
everything on your own.

368
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,560
I can't...

369
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,990
I can't.

370
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:20,050
I can't pilot the Eva if I have
to hurt or kill people.

371
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,180
I don't have the
right to do so.

372
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,780
I thought I had no choice
but to pilot the Eva...

373
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,050
...but it was
only an excuse.

374
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:32,370
I don't see anything so
I don't deserve the Eva, either.

375
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:36,600
There's nothing
I can do for anyone!

376
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,300
I did something
terrible to Asuka...

377
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,620
...and I killed
Kaworu, too.

378
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,080
I have no compassion,
I'm just sly and cowardly.

379
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,600
All I can do
is hurt people!

380
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,300
If so, I'd rather
do nothing!

381
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,880
I won't sympathize
with you.

382
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,600
If `yyou" don't want to get hurt,
die without trying anything.

383
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,860
Nothing will happen,
even if you cry!

384
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,100
You hate yourself.

385
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,030
Therefore, you're still
hurting others anyway.

386
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:13,040
You hurt yourself because you know it's more painful to hurt others.

387
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:18,280
But no matter how you feel, the result comes from your own judgement.

388
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,700
It's meaningful, Shinji.

389
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,660
It's about
you yourself.

390
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:28,600
Don't look away, but think about what you can do to atone for your sin.

391
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,330
But you're not me, and you
don't understand anything!

392
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,170
What's the matter with that?!
Are you going to quit now?!

393
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:43,250
If you don't
do anything...

394
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,840
...I won't
forgive you.

395
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,640
I'll never forgive you!

396
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,010
I'm not perfect
myself right now.

397
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:53,310
I realize what I've done wrong,
and regretted it later again and again.

398
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:56,300
That's how
I have been.

399
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,300
It's been a continuous cycle of premature delight and self-disgust...

400
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,900
...but each time,
I felt like I stepped forward.

401
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,900
Listen, Shinji...

402
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:10,630
...pilot the Eva one more time,
and break your cycle as an Eva pilot.

403
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:17,230
Find your own answers as to why you came here and why you're still here.

404
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:23,600
And when you settle the matter,
make sure you come back.

405
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,540
Promise?

406
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,090
Take care.

407
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,660
That's an adult kiss.

408
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,360
Let's do the rest
when you come back.

409
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:22,170
I should have changed the carpet like Asuka suggested...

410
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,910
...right, Pen-Pen?

411
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:31,050
Kaji, I did the
right thing, didn't I?

412
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,700
You're so
damn persistent...

413
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,850
...and I can't rely
on that stupid Shinji!

414
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,740
I've been waiting.

415
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:24,860
Sorry, but I changed Magi's
program before you did.

416
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,850
It's the last request
from your daughter.

417
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,080
Mom, please
die with me.

418
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,600
It didn't work...?

419
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
Why not?

420
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,000
Denied

421
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,420
Casper betrayed me!

422
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,210
You chose your man
instead of your daughter.

423
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,980
Akagi Ritsuko...
I truly...

424
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:02,900
You liar.

425
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,040
How is she
doing out there?

426
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,710
There's less than
1 minute until the limit.

427
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,980
At this rate,
Asuka will...

428
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,860
I can't lose...

429
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,310
...because Mama's
watching me!

430
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,300
Mama...

431
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,250
Mother?

432
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,400
This is the
last one!

433
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,650
The Longinus Lance...?!

434
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,600
The internal power
has run out.

435
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,330
Eva Unit 02 has reached
its activation limit.

436
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,400
What's happening...?

437
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,590
The defeated
Eva series are...

438
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,410
The Eva series
have reactivated.

439
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,750
Are they going
to finish it off?

440
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,200
What's happening?!

441
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,440
I can't keep watching!
I don't want to watch!

442
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,020
Is that Unit 02?!

443
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,700
I'll kill you.

444
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,900
I'll kill you.

445
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,300
I'll kill you.

446
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,300
I'll kill you.

447
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,850
I'll kill you.

448
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,700
I'll kill you.

449
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,800
I'll kill you.

450
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,300
I'll kill you.

451
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,300
I'll kill you.

452
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:12,930
Out of control?!

453
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:14,800
Stop, Asuka.

454
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Don't!

455
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,150
I'll kill you.

456
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,050
I'll kill you.

457
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,350
I'll kill you.

458
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,900
I'll kill you.

459
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,150
I'll kill you.

460
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,150
I'll kill you.

461
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,750
Shinji!

462
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,150
Unit 02...

463
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,860
Asuka is...!
Asuka is...!

464
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,250
But I can't get
onboard the Eva.

465
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,680
There's nothing
I can do.

466
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,050
Mother...

467
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,870
Unit 01 has
activated.

468
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,490
Evangelion Unit 01...?!

469
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,960
It truly
is a demon!

470
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:37,690
Asuka...

471
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:56,590
