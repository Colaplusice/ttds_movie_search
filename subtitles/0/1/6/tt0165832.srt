1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,001
There is this theory.

2
00:00:03,043 --> 00:00:06,130
Given an infinite universe
And infinite time...

3
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,173
all things will happen.

4
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,259
That means that every event is inevitable

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,345
including those that are impossible.

6
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:16,393
that's as good explanation
for all this as anything else.

7
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:19,689
Now, a lot of stories start in bars,
so that's where we are going to stars this one.

8
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:21,775
Not because that I was there.
I wasn't.

9
00:00:21,817 --> 00:00:25,946
But because it is a damn good
introduction to a very unique...

10
00:00:25,988 --> 00:00:28,033
fellow.

11
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:31,162
Legends of every major culture
all contain some sort of character

12
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:33,248
whose purpose is to grand wishes.

13
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,291
except Americas.

14
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:37,420
The Arabs have Jinni's...
The Irish have Leprechauns...

15
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:40,549
The Chinese have dragons and monkeys...
The Europeans have ferries and wood sprits.

16
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:43,303
Who do we have?

17
00:00:44,763 --> 00:00:46,807
Santa Claus?

18
00:00:46,849 --> 00:00:48,893
Santa Claus just brings presents.
He doesn't grand wishes.

19
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:52,022
Satan.  He grants wishes.

20
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:55,150
Zak, Satan predate American culture.
He doesn't grand wishes, he makes deals.

21
00:00:55,193 --> 00:00:56,193
All right, I give up.

22
00:00:56,236 --> 00:00:59,322
- What do we have here?
- No one.

23
00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:00,365
That's my thesis.

24
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:03,495
Our culture is unique in having no such mythology.

25
00:01:03,538 --> 00:01:05,581
Oh, you're wrong my friend.

26
00:01:05,623 --> 00:01:07,666
Excuse me?

27
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:11,838
There is a fella in America,
who grants wishes.

28
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:13,924
And only one to a customer.

29
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:17,054
And who is this fella?

30
00:01:17,097 --> 00:01:19,140
O.W. Grant.

31
00:01:19,182 --> 00:01:21,225
That's his usual name.
He's got many others.

32
00:01:21,268 --> 00:01:23,311
And he's an elusive sun of a bitch.

33
00:01:23,354 --> 00:01:25,397
You'd get easier time
finding a Jinni.

34
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,527
So how come, we've never heard
of this O.W. Grant?

35
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,656
You haven't heard O.W. Grant,
'cause America, is a much younger place than

36
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:35,827
Ireland or Arabia.
Not too many people have had the chance to meet up with him.

37
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,913
Let me guess.
You have.

38
00:01:37,956 --> 00:01:41,043
I met him out at Interstate 60.

39
00:01:41,086 --> 00:01:45,215
Accidental. That's his way.
Folks don't find him, he finds them.

40
00:01:45,257 --> 00:01:49,386
He just kinda happens in to them,
and they don't know who he is or what he does...

41
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:51,472
until he does it.

42
00:01:51,515 --> 00:01:53,559
And mostly messes with them, plays tricks,

43
00:01:53,602 --> 00:01:56,688
'cause that's his way too,
but sometimes...

44
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:59,818
if he takes a shine to you...
he'll play it strait.

45
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:02,946
Now, one story says
that his daddy was a Leprechaun...

46
00:02:02,988 --> 00:02:05,033
came over here with Irish.

47
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:07,119
Now, midgets are notorious skirt chasers

48
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:11,291
This leprechaun goes and knocks up a Cheyenne Indian...

49
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:15,463
Cheyenne get the land taken away
in the end up with the immortal, nomadic

50
00:02:15,504 --> 00:02:19,551
half-breed with magical powers.

51
00:02:19,677 --> 00:02:22,846
- Interstate 60, you said?
- Hmmmn

52
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:27,979
So, what does this O.W. Grant look like?

53
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,023
Red bow tie.

54
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:33,194
He smokes a pipe,
curved in the image of a monkey.

55
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:37,366
Maybe you'd be better of writing your theses
without mentioning O.W.

56
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:39,452
He'd probable rather not have
people knownin' about him.

57
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,495
You got it.

58
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:43,166
Good night.

59
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:47,796
Hey Quincy, check this out

60
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:51,509
There is no Interstate 60.

61
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,098
I 65, 64, 66, and 69.

62
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:57,850
No I 60.

63
00:02:58,268 --> 00:03:01,355
I guess tonight's everybody's fool-of-shit night.

64
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:05,528
Guy with a red bow tie and a monkey pipe,
who grants wishes...

65
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:08,031
Right.

66
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:20,130
No, damn it, look,

67
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:22,216
I need, that bid in before twelve...

68
00:03:22,257 --> 00:03:26,929
Yeah it's critical, just...
Right, call West...

69
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:32,269
Holy shit!

70
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:34,732
Broken jaw.

71
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:38,986
I'm sorry mister,
I didn't see you.

72
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:43,076
Are, are you OK
come on?

73
00:03:43,118 --> 00:03:44,119
Are you all right?

74
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:45,913
Jesus.

75
00:03:45,913 --> 00:03:48,291
Don't!
Stop!

76
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:49,334
Oh man!

77
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:51,420
My bike!

78
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:54,549
Look, I'm sorry.
I'll pay

79
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:56,635
Oh God damn it!

80
00:03:56,677 --> 00:03:58,721
Oh God damn it!
Look at my suit.

81
00:03:58,763 --> 00:04:00,807
Oh shit...

82
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:01,850
Oh fuck.

83
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:06,021
I've got a sails meeting at 11 o'clock.
This is a fuckin' disaster.

84
00:04:06,063 --> 00:04:09,151
My phone is my fuckin life line.

85
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:10,194
God damn it!

86
00:04:10,236 --> 00:04:12,279
Oh I say everything happens
for a reason.

87
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:15,408
May I guess,
I just needed a new bike.

88
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:17,494
I, for one, did not need this shit
in my life.

89
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,623
Not today.
Of all fuckin days!

90
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,752
Oh God damn it!
I wish, this had never happened!

91
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:26,881
I wish, it hadn't happened... I wish, it hadn't happened!

92
00:04:26,924 --> 00:04:27,924
Was that your wish?

93
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,010
If you had a wish,
you wished, this hadn't happened?

94
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:32,890
Fuckin A right!

95
00:04:33,182 --> 00:04:34,182
Granted!

96
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:36,268
Mr. Baker.

97
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:40,149
How did you know my name?

98
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:05,472
Damn it, I need the bid in before 12...

99
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:08,602
yeah it's critical...

100
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:12,774
look, just call West
have him fax the timesheet to the main office...

101
00:05:12,816 --> 00:05:31,082
Get it there by ...
Speak up, I can't hear you.

102
00:05:22,204 --> 00:05:26,292
Some people just don't know what to wish for.

103
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:56,622
As for my part in this story,
well, it began on a Tuesday.

104
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:57,623
September 18th.

105
00:05:57,666 --> 00:06:01,754
My birthday.
My 22nd birthday to be exact.

106
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:03,881
Oh, I'm Neal Oliver.

107
00:06:03,924 --> 00:06:07,010
And this mess, is my apartment
in St. Louis. Missouri.

108
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:12,059
Where at this particular moment
I was at MajorDecision.com.

109
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:16,772
Should I wear a tie to lunch?

110
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:31,542
Damn.

111
00:06:34,171 --> 00:06:37,257
Happy birthday Neal...
Sweet

112
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,300
Truth.

113
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:40,386
You are not mad,
that I'm bailing on you tonight?

114
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:41,429
No, no no no.

115
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:45,601
I mean how cool it you be for you,
to bomb your psyche-test because of some stupid concert

116
00:06:45,644 --> 00:06:48,731
No aah. You have got to wait until lunch.
That's your family rules.

117
00:06:48,773 --> 00:06:53,862
But you can open this.
I intercepted your snail mail.

118
00:06:56,074 --> 00:06:59,161
It's the reality check.
I'm game over on the art scholarship.

119
00:06:59,204 --> 00:07:01,289
We should at least open it.

120
00:07:01,497 --> 00:07:03,791
I can tell a rejection by weight.

121
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:12,720
You are the wrong sex, the wrong colour
and your family has too much money. I'm sorry.

122
00:07:12,763 --> 00:07:16,892
Just don't, don't mention anything
to my old man, please.

123
00:07:16,934 --> 00:07:17,934
You are so weird.

124
00:07:17,977 --> 00:07:18,977
What?

125
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,106
Well, you actually suppose to cut your grapefruit in half
and eat it with a spoon

126
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:25,236
not peel it, and eat it like an orange.

127
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,322
Oh look... it's her.

128
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:28,365
Again.

129
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,451
Should I be like jealous?

130
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:33,579
Oh, maybe if she was real.

131
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:35,666
So, I had another dream about her,
last night.

132
00:07:35,709 --> 00:07:38,795
She was in jail...
it's got to mean something.

133
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:42,967
I'll tell you what it means.
You saw her once somewhere

134
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:45,052
and made a subconscious impression,

135
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:47,598
the impression came back to you in a dream,
so you drew her

136
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,311
which made the impression stronger.
You dream, you draw, you draw, you dream

137
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:56,485
Now it's a vicious cycle.
So quit drawing her, and it'll end.

138
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:58,027
Well, thank you Karl Young.

139
00:07:58,446 --> 00:08:00,698
Fact is, I enjoy drawing her.

140
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:03,827
But, am I...
Am I any good at this Sally?

141
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,913
'cause today is the deadline of the Conrad Competition.

142
00:08:05,956 --> 00:08:07,999
Should I even enter these?

143
00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:09,042
Don't ask me Neal.

144
00:08:09,084 --> 00:08:11,128
I don't want to be judgmental.

145
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:18,472
But I do know, that just because you enjoy doing something,
doesn't necessarily mean that you should make it your career.

146
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,334
Here,
No worries.

147
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,462
As I said it all started on my 22nd birthday.

148
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:44,505
Specifically here.

149
00:08:44,547 --> 00:08:46,591
At my traditional birthday lunch.

150
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:49,721
As always, my father had picked the restaurant.

151
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,807
Attending with the usual suspects.

152
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:55,978
Sally, who my parents actually liked
maybe even more than I did.

153
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,064
My dad. Daniel.
Attorney at law.

154
00:08:58,106 --> 00:09:00,150
My mom Marlene.
The attorneys wife.

155
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:02,237
And my sister
and best friend Nancy.

156
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:07,659
Put on earth by the grace of God,
to keep me from going insane.

157
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:22,053
So what did you wish for?
Please tell me that it was something about us.

158
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,183
I'm guessing...
He wished to go skydiving again.

159
00:09:25,225 --> 00:09:27,937
God forbid.

160
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:30,398
Oh no, no. Neal you didn't.

161
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,484
Why, if I tell her, it won't come true.

162
00:09:32,525 --> 00:09:34,570
Actually that's no wife's tail.

163
00:09:34,611 --> 00:09:36,655
The truth is, you should always tell your wish.

164
00:09:36,697 --> 00:09:39,785
Kinda Carma thing.
Put it out there, project it.

165
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:41,871
Then it just might come true.

166
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:42,914
Never heard that before.

167
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:45,000
Oh, it's true.
Believe me.

168
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,043
I know.

169
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:48,837
I'll cut this for you.

170
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,301
OK, so now you have to tell us.

171
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:55,095
Yeah, come on, tell us Neilo.

172
00:09:57,558 --> 00:10:00,977
I wished for...

173
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,774
an answer.

174
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:06,903
An answer, OK
an answer to what?

175
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:10,032
An answer to my life.

176
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:11,075
Here it is.

177
00:10:11,117 --> 00:10:13,161
Happy birthday son.

178
00:10:13,202 --> 00:10:16,291
Your admission to the Bradford Law Fellowship.

179
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:19,419
Just do the interview next month, on October 15th,

180
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:20,462
and you're in.

181
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:21,505
It's all arranged.
By me.

182
00:10:21,547 --> 00:10:23,591
And you can take that to the bank.

183
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:26,721
Dad, I told you,
I wasn't sure yet.

184
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:28,431
Well, I can be sure for the both of us.

185
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:34,021
Last candle gone.

186
00:10:34,063 --> 00:10:36,107
Take it with you.

187
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:40,280
That is, if you want your wish granted.

188
00:10:40,322 --> 00:10:42,366
Thanks.

189
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:44,869
Oh, cool.

190
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:48,873
That's my colour too. Thank you.

191
00:11:00,138 --> 00:11:01,139
Sable brushes.

192
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:04,770
Nance.
You are the best Nance.

193
00:11:05,354 --> 00:11:06,355
You are welcome.

194
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:08,441
As for last.

195
00:11:08,482 --> 00:11:12,403
Happy birthday son.

196
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,785
Isn't it perfect?

197
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:17,828
Fire engin red.

198
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,000
You have no idea,
how hard it was to find a red convertible in this town.

199
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:26,087
Fule injected. 160 horses.
Csr phone.

200
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:29,301
Yeah, I even got you special plates.

201
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:32,680
Oh boy, I would have killed for a car like this,
when I was your age.

202
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,643
Aw, you know I thought it was high time for an image change,
and what better way to start.

203
00:11:36,934 --> 00:11:41,817
Now, you see, the engine is a 2.5 litre dual overhead cam, inline...

204
00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:43,903
As usual, it was all about him.

205
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:44,946
His idea of cool.

206
00:11:44,988 --> 00:11:47,032
Red was his colour. Not mine.

207
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:49,118
It was his pet phrase on the licence plates.

208
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:52,498
Clearly he was excepting me to become him.

209
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,376
Well? Isn't it the best present,
you could ever get?

210
00:11:55,418 --> 00:11:58,421
It's awesome.  Come on Neal, take me for a ride.

211
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,634
Well, son...

212
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:02,677
Neal!

213
00:12:02,718 --> 00:12:03,720
Oh my God!

214
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:05,807
Son!.

215
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:07,892
Somebody call 911.

216
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:11,021
Neal, Neal,
are you all right?

217
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,107
Talk to me son.

218
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,526
Neal.

219
00:12:45,482 --> 00:12:49,194
Get better soon honey,
Love Mom + Dad, XO

220
00:12:50,697 --> 00:12:54,161
St. Louiss finest thin crust

221
00:12:55,913 --> 00:12:57,957
You're all right Neal?

222
00:12:57,998 --> 00:13:00,043
Yeah, yeah, just...

223
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:02,128
it only hurts when I think.

224
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,757
They want to keep me overnight,
to log some tests in the morning

225
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:09,472
make sure,
my perception is like worked, yeah.

226
00:13:10,515 --> 00:13:11,516
You're goddess, Nance.

227
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,559
I know.

228
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,687
So, what's your perception of a dad

229
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:19,860
who buys you the gift,
he wants for himself?

230
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:21,946
About the same as toxic wastes.

231
00:13:21,988 --> 00:13:24,032
Your perception is fine.

232
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:29,246
That is one hell of a way
getting out of answering dad about the car.

233
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:32,376
Mom and dad are going to be here soon,
what are you gonna tell them?

234
00:13:32,418 --> 00:13:35,045
Lies.

235
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:37,591
The truth is just gonna piss him off.

236
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:39,677
Well maybe that's a good thing.

237
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:40,720
No, no.

238
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:43,849
Because then I' gonna get the hole riff,
about how I'm letting him down

239
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:45,935
It's just easy if I role with it.

240
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:49,439
And maybe someone will steal it.

241
00:13:56,407 --> 00:13:59,494
First a little visual warm up?

242
00:13:59,536 --> 00:14:03,666
I'll hold up a card, you name the suit.
I'm gonna go faster and faster.

243
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,796
So, see if you can keep up.

244
00:14:06,837 --> 00:14:08,882
OK.

245
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:10,967
Diamond.

246
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:12,010
Club.

247
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,053
Spade.

248
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:14,096
Heart.

249
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:15,139
Diamond.

250
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:16,182
Spade.

251
00:14:16,224 --> 00:14:17,225
Diamond.

252
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:18,268
Heart.

253
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,355
Club.
Spade.

254
00:14:20,396 --> 00:14:21,398
Heart.

255
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,441
Diamond.

256
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:23,484
Club.
Heart.

257
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:24,526
Spade.
Diamond.

258
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:25,569
Club.
Spade.

259
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:26,612
Heart.

260
00:14:26,654 --> 00:14:27,655
Club.

261
00:14:27,697 --> 00:14:28,698
Spade.

262
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,201
Heart.

263
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,871
Did I pass?

264
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,249
No.

265
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,128
But a few people do.

266
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,257
Black harts, red spades?.

267
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,344
Come on, that's like cheating.

268
00:14:44,386 --> 00:14:47,473
Aah, experience has conditioned you,
thinking that all hearts are red,

269
00:14:47,515 --> 00:14:49,559
and all spades are black.

270
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,602
Because their shapes are similar.

271
00:14:50,643 --> 00:14:53,730
It's easier for your mind
to interpret them...

272
00:14:53,772 --> 00:14:54,773
based on that passed experience,

273
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:57,903
than open to an idea that they can be different.

274
00:14:57,945 --> 00:14:59,989
We see what we expect to see.

275
00:15:00,031 --> 00:15:03,118
Not necessarily, what's really there.

276
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:08,333
Children who have never played cards
always pass this test.

277
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:14,215
Makes you wonder how many other things
are right in front of you, sight, sound, smell

278
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:17,720
that you can't experience,
because you've been conditioned not to?

279
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:20,849
The good news is ...
If we'll do the test again you will pass.

280
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:25,021
Once you are aware,
that there can be black hearts and red spades,

281
00:15:25,063 --> 00:15:27,107
you'll be able to perceive them.

282
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:30,693
Your brain is wired,
just like the Interstate highways system.

283
00:15:30,736 --> 00:15:33,365
It's easier to go from one well to go
from one well travelled place to another

284
00:15:33,407 --> 00:15:38,580
but the places in between, off the highway ...

285
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:43,585
Even though they're there, most people just zip right pass them.

286
00:15:44,045 --> 00:15:45,882
Well, that's cool trick

287
00:15:45,923 --> 00:15:49,010
But there aren't any card games with red spades and black hearts.

288
00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:51,138
Well, how do you know?

289
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:00,483
Mr. Oliver.  I'm Dr. Craig.

290
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:03,612
You ready to take some tests?

291
00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:05,990
Yeah.

292
00:16:06,991 --> 00:16:09,871
Well, that was some warmer back to you got there, that guy Ray.

293
00:16:09,913 --> 00:16:10,914
Who?

294
00:16:10,955 --> 00:16:13,875
Ray.  You know, that guy, who was ju ...
He just left.

295
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:15,085
You know, the tricked cards.

296
00:16:15,127 --> 00:16:18,214
No, there is no one on staff, named Ray.

297
00:16:18,256 --> 00:16:20,300
No, he was just here.

298
00:16:20,342 --> 00:16:23,430
Wacky guy, with the cards...
with the light-green lab coat.

299
00:16:23,472 --> 00:16:24,514
The staff wears blue here, not green.

300
00:16:24,514 --> 00:16:29,687
But we can test your colour perception.

301
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:33,066
Dropped seven of harts.

302
00:16:35,988 --> 00:16:38,740
Come on in son.

303
00:16:39,116 --> 00:16:41,160
So, how's that new car?

304
00:16:41,202 --> 00:16:45,790
- Awesome?
- Yeah dad... it's very awesome.

305
00:16:46,418 --> 00:16:49,672
What is on your mind, son?

306
00:16:51,632 --> 00:16:55,762
I'm not so sure
about this Bradford thing, dad.

307
00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:58,683
Seams little too easy, you know.

308
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,021
I spent years working very hard,
so it would be easy for you.

309
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:05,150
What? You want to work nights
in that warehouse for the rest of your life?

310
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,236
Come on dad,
that just so I don't have to ask you for cash.

311
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,321
Son, let me give you
some Daniel Olivier philosophy.

312
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:11,408
And you can take it to the bank.

313
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,494
When ever someone offers you an advantage,
take it.

314
00:17:13,536 --> 00:17:15,580
And this program is an advantage.

315
00:17:15,622 --> 00:17:18,709
It will get you
to any law school in the country.

316
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,752
America needs another lawyer.

317
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:23,924
Another good lawyer.
We can always use one of those.

318
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:26,010
- That was costs 30 Gs ?
32,200.

319
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:29,597
I outbid two major collectors
to get it.

320
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,891
It's a lot of money for a drop cloth.

321
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:34,354
That shows you how much you know.
That is Franklin Samuel original.

322
00:17:34,395 --> 00:17:37,483
He's a name artist.
If you ever sell anything,

323
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:42,698
the operative would been if,
maybe... maybe... your opinion will count.

324
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,784
Look dad,
I'm just not sure, OK?

325
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:47,914
I thought about,
maybe taking some time off.

326
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:50,000
Time off for what?

327
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:53,128
Sort of take stock, you know,
try figure some things out.

328
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,630
Waste your time with your art?

329
00:17:54,672 --> 00:17:57,966
It's a hobby son.
Would you live it that?

330
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:00,430
Look, I got you into Bradford,
because Prat's on the board,

331
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:02,516
and he won't be next year.

332
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:05,644
So if you don't take advantage of it now,
there won't be a next time.

333
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:07,730
Why not just go thru the program?

334
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:12,946
If you ultimately decide, law school is not for you,
then, I'll... live with it.

335
00:18:12,988 --> 00:18:18,160
But at least you'll be Bradford fellow
and that's something you can always take to the bank.

336
00:18:18,202 --> 00:18:21,289
Then you can, you know...
figure things out.

337
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:23,375
So you're going Bradford, ha.

338
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:26,505
- I thought you weren't sure.
- I'm not.

339
00:18:26,547 --> 00:18:28,591
I think it would be stupid,
not to at least give it a shot.

340
00:18:28,632 --> 00:18:31,719
Can't let down the old man.

341
00:18:31,761 --> 00:18:33,805
Bought you off with a fancy car?

342
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,891
He's maximizing his options, Frank.
It's very mature.

343
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:39,480
We should be supportive,
not judgemental.

344
00:18:47,406 --> 00:18:51,327
Look for the good in your fellow man.

345
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:55,709
The warm wind of romance
blows around you.

346
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,255
With good health,
prosperity will follow.

347
00:19:05,138 --> 00:19:07,182
October 15th.
That's the day of my Bradford interview.

348
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:09,851
Let me see that.

349
00:19:11,395 --> 00:19:15,568
OK, you got me.
It's blank.

350
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:20,615
What the hell?

351
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,214
I would never get on that shit, never.

352
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:35,343
Just, leave everything behind,
not know where are you going.

353
00:19:35,385 --> 00:19:37,429
I can't believe that you would Neal.

354
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:42,060
Just, leave your friends,  and your family,
and for what?

355
00:19:42,686 --> 00:19:46,606
Hey, earth to Neal.
What's the matter?

356
00:19:46,858 --> 00:19:47,859
Sally my fortune.

357
00:19:47,901 --> 00:19:50,989
Didn't it say:
October 15th, are you sure?

358
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,032
Obviously it didn't.

359
00:19:52,073 --> 00:19:54,784
At the restaurant, when I showed it to you,
isn't that what it said?

360
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,203
Why do you make such a big deal about this?

361
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:59,332
Because it is bugging me.  That's why.

362
00:19:59,374 --> 00:20:03,505
You're just projecting your anxiety, about your decision,
and that is natural.

363
00:20:03,547 --> 00:20:06,634
It's OK. You'll do great.

364
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:09,971
Because that's who you are.

365
00:20:10,847 --> 00:20:13,934
Here.. Just take a nice deep breath, relax.

366
00:20:13,976 --> 00:20:14,978
Sally, listen to me.

367
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,064
What are the chances?

368
00:20:17,106 --> 00:20:19,150
That of all cookies in that kitchen,

369
00:20:19,191 --> 00:20:22,278
that exact one ended up on a plate,
that was taken to our table,

370
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,321
and I picked it?

371
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:24,364
It was blank, Neal.

372
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:28,829
The fortune was blank.
You projected.

373
00:20:31,707 --> 00:20:33,752
I projected?

374
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:34,836
Right.

375
00:20:34,877 --> 00:20:41,053
That was the politically correct way to say I was seeing things...
Well, a lovely thought.

376
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:46,268
I worked graveyard shifts at the grocery warehouse, filling orders
for the trucks to take to the various stores in the morning.

377
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:48,353
I liked it for three reasons.

378
00:20:48,395 --> 00:20:49,396
I'd gotten the job on my own.

379
00:20:49,438 --> 00:20:52,526
It paid enough that I didn't have to ask the old man for cash.

380
00:20:52,568 --> 00:20:57,741
And it annoyed Daniel
that his son was even working at such a low-class job.

381
00:20:57,783 --> 00:21:02,788
I hear you are quittin
to become some big shot lawyer in your new fancy-ass car, hmmm?

382
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,294
Well, lucky do.

383
00:21:06,336 --> 00:21:08,171
Hey, Curby.
Get the kid a brake.

384
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:11,300
You just remember that
no matter how hard shit you think you are,

385
00:21:11,342 --> 00:21:13,386
It's always gonna be more the same.

386
00:21:13,427 --> 00:21:15,473
Just another High School.

387
00:21:15,514 --> 00:21:16,515
- High School?
- Hell yeah.

388
00:21:16,557 --> 00:21:19,644
Everything in life is like high school.
They're just changin names.

389
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:21,730
You take this place.

390
00:21:21,772 --> 00:21:23,816
Instead of principle, we've got boss.

391
00:21:23,858 --> 00:21:25,902
Instead of teachers, supervisors.

392
00:21:25,943 --> 00:21:29,032
Instead of assignments, they give us work orders

393
00:21:29,073 --> 00:21:32,160
and if you fuck up them work orders,
you get fired.

394
00:21:32,202 --> 00:21:35,289
Instead of expelled.

395
00:21:35,331 --> 00:21:39,461
Oh yeah, names are different,
but it is exact same shit.

396
00:21:39,502 --> 00:21:42,048
High school.

397
00:21:44,718 --> 00:21:46,594
Damaged goods.

398
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:53,103
Well, store can't sell them.
Guess I'll just have to take them off their hands.

399
00:21:56,191 --> 00:22:00,321
Is he right, Otis?
Is everything more the same?

400
00:22:00,363 --> 00:22:02,407
Yeah, if you look at it like that.

401
00:22:02,449 --> 00:22:05,537
I mean, look at me,
I show up here, see the same people,

402
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:07,623
take shipment to the stores,

403
00:22:07,664 --> 00:22:10,752
see those same people,
eat at the same places,

404
00:22:10,793 --> 00:22:14,923
see those same people...
but not really.

405
00:22:14,965 --> 00:22:15,966
See.

406
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:20,139
I like seeing those people.
Well most of them any way.

407
00:22:20,181 --> 00:22:23,268
If I want something different,
I can make it different, go a different way.

408
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:27,439
Eat at a different place,
do an Interstate gig.

409
00:22:27,481 --> 00:22:31,194
See I never went to high school...

410
00:22:31,654 --> 00:22:32,655
Look at them.

411
00:22:32,697 --> 00:22:35,784
In the morning they will get up,
and go to the store.

412
00:22:35,825 --> 00:22:37,870
And the paste will be on the shelves where it always is,

413
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:40,998
and not one of them will give
a moment's thought as to how it got there.

414
00:22:42,084 --> 00:22:43,085
Holy shit.

415
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:45,672
That's her.

416
00:22:46,256 --> 00:22:50,386
I must have seen her on the billboard,
and that's how she got in my dreams.

417
00:22:50,427 --> 00:22:51,429
You dream about her?

418
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,515
Yeah, yeah, Yes.

419
00:22:53,557 --> 00:22:54,558
Pretty silly, huh.

420
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,644
Maybe it means something.

421
00:22:56,686 --> 00:22:58,730
Like what?

422
00:22:58,772 --> 00:23:00,816
Like the thunderbolt, you know,
love at the first sight.

423
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:03,945
Come on Otis, that's just fairytale stuff.

424
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:06,031
That's how I met my wife.

425
00:23:06,073 --> 00:23:10,203
Spotted her in a crowd at the river front,
4th of July fireworks.

426
00:23:10,245 --> 00:23:13,332
Couldn't take my eyes of her.
Fireworks were up there,

427
00:23:13,374 --> 00:23:15,418
but I was staring at her.

428
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:18,548
And I just knew.

429
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:22,719
Well. See, all my girlfriends,
are always a reaction to the one I had last.

430
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:26,891
Janet was so opinionated about my art,
it drove me crazy.

431
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:30,020
So I found Sally, who refuses to be judgemental about it.

432
00:23:30,061 --> 00:23:33,150
Meanwhile she's trying to psychoanalyse me.

433
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:36,278
So she is not the one either.

434
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,364
Maybe you should go after her?

435
00:23:38,406 --> 00:23:42,579
Girl like that. She's a model,
she's probably got guys fallen all over her

436
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:45,289
Guys with big portfolios.

437
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:47,751
Yeah, I think it's kinda childish idea.

438
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:50,880
Chasing a dream.

439
00:23:58,223 --> 00:24:02,353
Hi, your billboard on Delmar & Wicker's,
the one on the side of the building?

440
00:24:02,395 --> 00:24:05,482
Yeah, whose ad agency is that?

441
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:07,569
No, no, no... Next to the Casino Queen billboard.

442
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:12,200
The girl with the phone,
says: "There is another choice."

443
00:24:12,825 --> 00:24:14,869
Blank?! No, no It can't be blank.

444
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,371
I was just there.
I just saw it.

445
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:20,127
No, I just saw it!

446
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:32,601
Hey, what is the sign on the right said?

447
00:24:32,643 --> 00:24:36,855
What, are you nuts?
It's blank, man.

448
00:25:04,976 --> 00:25:09,107
<i>Neal Oliver.
Your appointment has been scheduled on tomorrow.</i>

449
00:25:09,148 --> 00:25:12,235
<i>September 25th. 10 AM. 555 Olive Street.</i>

450
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,278
<i>Suite 1300.</i>

451
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,196
<i>No rescheduling.</i>

452
00:25:15,238 --> 00:25:17,450
<i>Neal Oliver, your appointment...
- Who is this?</i>

453
00:25:17,492 --> 00:25:19,536
Hello?

454
00:25:19,577 --> 00:25:19,995
Hello?

455
00:25:20,036 --> 00:25:26,065
<i>10 AM. 555 Olive Street.
Suite 1300, no rescheduling.</i>

456
00:26:27,374 --> 00:26:28,375
Morning, Mr. Oliver.

457
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:31,504
Wasn't sure that you'd actually show up.

458
00:26:31,545 --> 00:26:34,633
Not everyone does.

459
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:35,676
Ray?

460
00:26:35,718 --> 00:26:37,762
I've got a job for you.
If you want it.

461
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:41,934
Drive cross country.
Deliver a package.

462
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:45,063
Right, what the hell is going on here Ray?
Because I'm seeing things on signs...

463
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,105
In fortune cookies...

464
00:26:46,148 --> 00:26:48,192
I mean, in weird messages...

465
00:26:48,234 --> 00:26:52,364
Black Hearts, or red Spades.
I told you, you can see them now.

466
00:26:52,406 --> 00:26:54,450
What's it all about?

467
00:26:54,492 --> 00:26:55,493
It's all about you, Neal.

468
00:26:55,534 --> 00:26:58,581
It's all about you.

469
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:01,459
Here's the job.

470
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:04,880
Misspelled Denver.

471
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:07,632
Did I now?

472
00:27:08,051 --> 00:27:10,095
OK, so why me?

473
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,180
Why not FedEx?

474
00:27:11,221 --> 00:27:12,182
What's in here, any way?

475
00:27:12,223 --> 00:27:13,641
Can't really say.

476
00:27:13,683 --> 00:27:17,396
You can't really say, because you don't know,
or you do know, and don't want me to know?

477
00:27:17,438 --> 00:27:20,525
Either way, the result is the same.

478
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:22,611
So what's this job pay?

479
00:27:22,652 --> 00:27:24,698
Can't really say.

480
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:25,741
What's the catch?

481
00:27:25,782 --> 00:27:27,826
Or you can't say that either?

482
00:27:27,868 --> 00:27:29,912
Alwayes wanted the answers,
aren't you?

483
00:27:29,954 --> 00:27:35,128
Consider it, an interesting way to break in the new century.

484
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,257
Or simply,
a way to break in that new car.

485
00:27:38,298 --> 00:27:41,385
Before the Bradford interview.

486
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:44,514
How do you know about that?

487
00:27:44,556 --> 00:27:47,101
Open it.

488
00:27:57,072 --> 00:27:59,618
Sit down.

489
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:03,289
Here'e the deal.

490
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:07,461
If you walk out of here with that package,
you agree to deliver it.

491
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:12,676
You don't loose it, you don't open it,
and you don't try to find out what's inside it.

492
00:28:12,718 --> 00:28:15,805
You'll be compensated on the other end.

493
00:28:15,847 --> 00:28:19,685
Go by way of Interstate 60.

494
00:28:20,018 --> 00:28:22,062
Delivery date is October 2nd.

495
00:28:22,104 --> 00:28:26,902
So you'll have time to visit some towns,
meet some people.

496
00:28:26,944 --> 00:28:28,321
See what's out there.

497
00:28:28,363 --> 00:28:31,450
Pick up some travellers' tales.

498
00:28:31,491 --> 00:28:34,579
High way experiences.

499
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,582
Episodes of the Road.

500
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,794
This is too surreal.

501
00:28:39,836 --> 00:28:45,675
I mean, you, this office,
the 13th floor of a building that has no 13th floor

502
00:28:46,093 --> 00:28:49,848
My alarm clock's gonna go off any second.

503
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:53,144
Rise and shine.

504
00:28:54,438 --> 00:29:00,778
You're awake Neal.
Could be you're awake for the first time in your life.

505
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:10,165
It's our standard form.

506
00:29:17,384 --> 00:29:20,471
And I'll need you to seal it with the drop of your blood.

507
00:29:20,513 --> 00:29:21,514
Blood?

508
00:29:21,556 --> 00:29:25,309
Of course.
I'm the DEVIL.

509
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:27,773
Just kidding.

510
00:29:27,814 --> 00:29:32,778
Tradicionally, a man means what he says,
he'll put his blood where his mouth is.

511
00:29:36,158 --> 00:29:38,954
All right.

512
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,375
Oh, one more thing.

513
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:46,879
There's a killer out there.
So be careful

514
00:29:48,674 --> 00:29:49,675
Now you tell me?

515
00:29:49,717 --> 00:29:50,719
After I sign?

516
00:29:50,761 --> 00:29:53,848
The journey of life
always includes a possibility of death.

517
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,934
This killer,
what does he look like?

518
00:29:55,975 --> 00:30:00,105
-Who said it's a man?
- It's a woman?

519
00:30:00,147 --> 00:30:03,235
It's not this Robin Fields, is it?

520
00:30:03,277 --> 00:30:07,239
I know... you can't really say.

521
00:30:09,534 --> 00:30:12,621
I didn't mispell the name of that town.

522
00:30:12,663 --> 00:30:14,708
You'll find it.

523
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,837
Just go west on Interstate 60.

524
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:22,009
Look, we've been over this.
There is no Intestate 60.

525
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,095
There's US 60.
But there is no Interstate 60.

526
00:30:24,136 --> 00:30:26,180
Look... there's got to be.

527
00:30:26,222 --> 00:30:28,267
Well look at here. Here is 70.

528
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:31,396
The next major route south is 40.

529
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:36,611
So if there was an I 60,
it would have to be some where between 70 and 40.

530
00:30:36,652 --> 00:30:38,696
But, as you can see, it's not there.

531
00:30:38,738 --> 00:30:40,199
It simply doesn't exist.

532
00:30:41,034 --> 00:30:43,912
Where do you find a highway, that doesn't exist?

533
00:30:43,954 --> 00:30:47,041
Well, I decided to look where it'd be if it did exist.

534
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:51,214
Ray said that you don't find hidden places,
by sticking to the well travelled routs

535
00:30:51,255 --> 00:30:56,929
So, I skipped well travelled Interstate 55,
and went south on Boob Dylan's highway 61.

536
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,944
And there she was again.

537
00:31:08,986 --> 00:31:11,030
Telling me, I was right.

538
00:31:11,072 --> 00:31:14,117
I was fast becoming a believer in signs.

539
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:23,546
It's you I'm delivering this package, isn't it?

540
00:31:23,588 --> 00:31:27,134
You're Robin Fields.

541
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,848
Now it makes all sense.

542
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,934
Cool. Very cool.

543
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:36,313
Very, very cool.

544
00:32:07,395 --> 00:32:09,439
You are the waiter, from my birthday party

545
00:32:09,481 --> 00:32:11,525
O.W. Grant.

546
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:12,568
Neal Oliver.

547
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:15,696
It's a strange coincidence,
seeing you here again.

548
00:32:15,738 --> 00:32:17,783
Only if you believe in coincidence.

549
00:32:17,825 --> 00:32:19,869
I prefer inevitability.

550
00:32:19,911 --> 00:32:20,954
Every event is inevitable.

551
00:32:20,994 --> 00:32:24,041
If it wasn't, it wouldn't happen.

552
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:26,543
Right.

553
00:32:26,586 --> 00:32:31,717
Oh, I forgot to give you, your birthday present.

554
00:32:41,814 --> 00:32:43,858
Remember your wish?

555
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,901
An answer.

556
00:32:44,943 --> 00:32:45,944
- Yeah
- That's great.

557
00:32:45,986 --> 00:32:48,030
Yeah, gets greater.

558
00:32:48,072 --> 00:32:50,116
Go on, go ahead. Try it.

559
00:32:50,158 --> 00:32:53,286
Yes or No questions.

560
00:32:53,327 --> 00:32:58,460
OK, hmmm...
Eight ball, is there an Interstate 60?

561
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:11,851
I told you, it'd get greater.

562
00:33:12,061 --> 00:33:13,062
Who are you mister?

563
00:33:13,104 --> 00:33:16,483
The O.W stands for One Wish.

564
00:33:17,276 --> 00:33:18,278
That's what I do.

565
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,321
I grant wishes.

566
00:33:19,363 --> 00:33:21,407
One to a customer.

567
00:33:21,448 --> 00:33:23,493
Your was more interesting,
then most.

568
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:24,535
Open ended.

569
00:33:24,577 --> 00:33:26,621
Signifies thought instead of greed.

570
00:33:26,663 --> 00:33:28,707
That's what I get most of the time.

571
00:33:28,749 --> 00:33:29,750
gimme, gimme, gimme,

572
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:31,837
gimme this, gimme that...

573
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:34,966
Usually money, or sex,
or easy living.

574
00:33:35,007 --> 00:33:39,096
How I deliver.
Yeah, that depends on what mood i'm in.

575
00:33:40,222 --> 00:33:44,311
Eight Ball, is this guy bull-shitting me?

576
00:33:52,738 --> 00:33:55,284
Come on.

577
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:59,079
Let's find that road.

578
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:08,342
Now, one young couple wished to be married.
Live happily ever after.

579
00:34:08,384 --> 00:34:13,557
So I blew up their car.
At the church, on the way to the honeymoon.

580
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,686
Another guy. He wanted great perfect sex every day,

581
00:34:16,727 --> 00:34:18,771
with his choice of gorgeous women. No pregnancies.

582
00:34:18,813 --> 00:34:19,815
So...

583
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:23,987
Everyday there is a FedEx delivery...
of a skin magazine...

584
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,030
box of tissues.

585
00:34:25,072 --> 00:34:28,784
There's the Stop sign.
Turn right.

586
00:34:45,932 --> 00:34:49,311
There is a sign post,
up ahead.

587
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,527
Son of a bitch.
I found it.

588
00:34:58,448 --> 00:35:01,827
It was inevitable.

589
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:29,696
So, I thought all Interstates were divided highways,
with limited access.

590
00:35:29,738 --> 00:35:35,788
No, when highway doesn't officially exist.
The rules don't apply.

591
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:42,212
OK, so how is it, we're on a highway,
that is on any map,

592
00:35:42,254 --> 00:35:44,298
going to a towns, that presumably don't exist?

593
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:50,180
Well, there are unlisted phone numbers, right?
So, why can't there be unlisted highways and towns?

594
00:35:50,222 --> 00:35:52,643
I don't buy it.
There's got to be a better explanation, than that.

595
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:55,771
Better explanation.

596
00:35:55,813 --> 00:35:59,861
OK. How about it's a...
parallel dimension.

597
00:35:59,986 --> 00:36:00,987
Or you're in a dream.

598
00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:03,115
Or it has something to do
with your wish.

599
00:36:03,155 --> 00:36:05,159
Or... you're in a coma
from when that bucket hit you.

600
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,746
Or maybe...
just maybe...

601
00:36:09,372 --> 00:36:12,125
You're dead.

602
00:36:12,502 --> 00:36:14,546
Well?

603
00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:16,632
Well, what do you want kid?

604
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,718
I just gave you not one explanation,
but six.

605
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,804
All reasonable.

606
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,306
You want an answer,
pick one.

607
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:23,933
It want change anything.

608
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:27,062
You, you took a job,
and now you got to do it.

609
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:29,148
Yeah, but it could change something.

610
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,234
So, what if I'm dead?

611
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:33,361
What if I'm dead, right now.

612
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:35,407
There is no reason,
why shouldn't drive on oncoming traffic, right?

613
00:36:35,448 --> 00:36:38,659
OK, go ahead.
Try it.

614
00:36:41,706 --> 00:36:44,793
But that's way you accelerated in way of the big semi,
coming at us,

615
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,880
which should be in about 25 seconds, I figure.

616
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:50,008
Come to this.
Now, if you are dead...

617
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,634
Then, this is the after life,

618
00:36:51,634 --> 00:36:54,722
and you made a deal with a guy, sealed in blood,

619
00:36:55,265 --> 00:36:57,309
who knew everything about you,
even what you are going to say, before you said it.

620
00:36:57,351 --> 00:37:00,439
Now who do you think,
that guy might be?

621
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,652
And...
do you think it is a good idea to piss him of?

622
00:37:11,328 --> 00:37:13,998
Maybe you got a point.

623
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:16,750
Maybe I do.

624
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:21,632
Oh, I love this highway.

625
00:37:26,556 --> 00:37:29,643
Me?
I consider myself an artist, too.

626
00:37:29,684 --> 00:37:32,771
I see life, as..
art appreciation.

627
00:37:32,813 --> 00:37:35,901
You know,
some artist can't stand the sight of their work once it's finished.

628
00:37:35,943 --> 00:37:39,030
Me, I'm one of my own biggest fans.

629
00:37:39,072 --> 00:37:44,245
And one of my favourites,
will be coming through that door... any moment..

630
00:37:44,286 --> 00:37:46,748
Now.

631
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:04,062
Yeah, can I take your order?

632
00:38:04,104 --> 00:38:06,148
15 double-cheeseburgers, please.

633
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,234
15 double-cheese to go.

634
00:38:08,275 --> 00:38:10,320
Oh, not to go.
I'll eat them here.

635
00:38:10,361 --> 00:38:11,363
Hold the order.

636
00:38:11,404 --> 00:38:14,492
You're going to eat 15 double-cheeseburgers,
all by your self?

637
00:38:14,534 --> 00:38:15,535
Yeah.

638
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:17,621
Why, they are real big?
You think 15 to many?

639
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:20,750
Way to many.

640
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:24,923
All right. Twelve then.
Even dozen.

641
00:38:24,964 --> 00:38:27,008
Look,
are you drunk or something, mister?

642
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:31,180
Well I don't know.
Can you get drunk on six beer?

643
00:38:31,222 --> 00:38:34,558
Hay fella.
I've got a hundred says that you can't eat six double-cheese,

644
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,395
as much less twelve.

645
00:38:36,436 --> 00:38:39,525
So, what you're saying is,
they're really big cheeseburgers?

646
00:38:39,566 --> 00:38:42,653
My hundred says you can't eat six double-cheese.

647
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:46,742
Well, I'm kinda hungry.
maybe you're right.

648
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:48,912
Twelve is to many burgers.
I'll tell you what?

649
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:57,255
Make it two double-cheese, three orders of fried chicken,
one BLT, two ham & Swiss on rie, chicken fried steak,

650
00:38:57,297 --> 00:39:01,428
Turkey club, and two bolls chilli extra onions.

651
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,557
And one piece of each of those pies.

652
00:39:04,598 --> 00:39:06,643
One piece of each of these pies?

653
00:39:06,684 --> 00:39:08,728
Anything else?

654
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,814
Three order onion rings.

655
00:39:10,856 --> 00:39:14,987
That's much more sensible lunch,
than twelve double-cheeseburgers.

656
00:39:15,029 --> 00:39:17,864
Oh, and hold the pickles.

657
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,244
100 bucks.

658
00:39:21,286 --> 00:39:25,625
If you can finish all that food,
in one hour.

659
00:39:26,502 --> 00:39:30,674
Without getting up from that counter,
and without losing your lunch.

660
00:39:31,716 --> 00:39:33,761
I'm not much of a betting man.

661
00:39:33,802 --> 00:39:37,681
Two to One odds then...
No, no, I'll give you Three to One.

662
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:42,105
That's 300 to mine...
against 100 to yours.

663
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:45,067
Well, what the Hell.

664
00:39:45,275 --> 00:39:48,528
It's only money.

665
00:39:52,577 --> 00:39:53,827
Hal...

666
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:55,664
You better hold onto this money.

667
00:39:55,706 --> 00:39:58,167
Sure.

668
00:39:59,877 --> 00:40:01,921
Yeah, I'll take some of that.

669
00:40:01,963 --> 00:40:05,051
Eight Ball, is this guy gonna really eat all that food?

670
00:40:12,393 --> 00:40:14,438
Can I hmm...
Can I get on this action?

671
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:15,482
Ask him.

672
00:40:15,523 --> 00:40:17,567
No I like long shots.

673
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:19,653
You're crazy your knees.

674
00:40:19,695 --> 00:40:21,739
My money just ass good, right.

675
00:40:21,781 --> 00:40:23,867
Hell about me.

676
00:40:23,907 --> 00:40:28,039
Sir,
you want to drink anything with that?

677
00:40:36,383 --> 00:40:38,427
There's your order.

678
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:42,516
All right. It's 13:10.
On your mark... Get set...

679
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:45,186
Wait.

680
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,899
Ketchup, please.

681
00:41:26,447 --> 00:41:28,534
Thanks.

682
00:41:28,575 --> 00:41:30,578
All right... What's the trick?

683
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,621
Trick?

684
00:41:31,663 --> 00:41:32,664
Where is the food?

685
00:41:32,706 --> 00:41:34,750
Can't all be in your stomach.

686
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:36,836
Actually, I don't know.

687
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:39,964
The fact is, I always loved eating.
More than anything.

688
00:41:40,006 --> 00:41:43,094
Go into a restaurant,
want to order everything on the menu.

689
00:41:43,136 --> 00:41:48,309
But, I was always frustrated,
by the small capacity of my stomach.

690
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:52,480
Well, 17 years ago,
I made a wish...

691
00:41:52,523 --> 00:41:55,610
And amazingly enough it came true.

692
00:41:55,652 --> 00:41:58,739
Now I have, what you might call,
a black hole in my belly.

693
00:41:58,781 --> 00:42:01,868
Onely I have to keep eating like this,
six or seven times a day.

694
00:42:01,909 --> 00:42:03,954
Gets expensive.

695
00:42:03,995 --> 00:42:09,877
So, I travel a lot,
and take advantage of guys like you to pay for it.

696
00:42:10,254 --> 00:42:13,174
That's a good one.

697
00:42:13,383 --> 00:42:14,801
Excuse me, mister.

698
00:42:16,093 --> 00:42:17,973
I've got to know one thing.

699
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,642
Do you still love eating?

700
00:42:20,684 --> 00:42:24,896
No...
now it's a drag.

701
00:42:26,942 --> 00:42:28,986
Listen kid...

702
00:42:29,027 --> 00:42:33,158
Nobody minds money taken by that guy,
he gave us good show for our money.

703
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,244
But I draw a line over what you did.

704
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:36,287
What did I do?

705
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:37,789
I just bet the right horse, that's all.

706
00:42:37,831 --> 00:42:40,459
You run on it. I know a hustle when I see one.

707
00:42:40,501 --> 00:42:43,589
I played a hunch, I swear to God.
I've never seen that guy before in my life

708
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,632
But your friend, there has.

709
00:42:44,673 --> 00:42:46,718
Haven't you fella?

710
00:42:46,759 --> 00:42:48,803
Oh, I wont deny it.

711
00:42:48,845 --> 00:42:51,932
Now,
get back the money you stole, son.

712
00:42:51,974 --> 00:42:55,062
Look sir, I won a couple of bets.
If that's such a crime why dont we call the police.

713
00:42:55,104 --> 00:42:58,315
I am the police.

714
00:42:59,275 --> 00:43:02,111
Sorry about that.

715
00:43:05,533 --> 00:43:06,535
That's all my money.

716
00:43:06,577 --> 00:43:08,244
Hit the rode, fellas.

717
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:15,545
OK, so what's your game Mr Grant.
'cause it seems like you know exactly what's gonna happen,

718
00:43:15,587 --> 00:43:16,588
just before it happens,

719
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,007
and it's just like
fucking with me!

720
00:43:18,049 --> 00:43:20,094
Oh, don't take it personal kid.

721
00:43:20,136 --> 00:43:22,180
I fuck with everybody.

722
00:43:22,222 --> 00:43:23,223
That's what I do.

723
00:43:23,265 --> 00:43:27,395
If I tie highly recommend it as
an unending source of amusement.

724
00:43:27,436 --> 00:43:31,567
And as far as knowing what's gonna happen.
Well... on this highway,

725
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,653
the past, the present, the future,

726
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:37,532
the "What if some maybe's, the roads not taken",

727
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:40,954
could all converge, get jumble up.

728
00:43:40,995 --> 00:43:45,126
I just happen to be tuned into it.
That's all.

729
00:43:45,168 --> 00:43:48,297
So what are you?
Like an Angel or God, or something?

730
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:51,550
Just, picking up certain people to give him a wish?

731
00:43:51,591 --> 00:43:54,513
No... no,
just a guy who likes to mess with peoples heads.

732
00:43:54,554 --> 00:43:59,019
I'm a Joker...
in life's deck.

733
00:43:59,977 --> 00:44:01,814
But, why do it?

734
00:44:01,856 --> 00:44:02,857
I enjoy it.

735
00:44:02,899 --> 00:44:05,986
You should always find something to do,
that you enjoy.

736
00:44:06,027 --> 00:44:10,158
Although I will admit I have been
considering a career change.

737
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,244
Job in a convenience store...

738
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:13,329
Or maybe becoming...

739
00:44:14,454 --> 00:44:16,416
a male prostitute.

740
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:19,378
You're gay?

741
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:23,759
- You're fucking with me, aren't you?
- Yeah.

742
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,846
Fact is I'm a virgin.

743
00:44:26,888 --> 00:44:28,932
I always will be.

744
00:44:28,974 --> 00:44:32,104
My penis...
was cut off in a very weird accident,

745
00:44:32,104 --> 00:44:33,105
when I was nine.

746
00:44:33,146 --> 00:44:35,899
Yeah, right.

747
00:44:36,275 --> 00:44:39,362
You want to see it?

748
00:44:40,447 --> 00:44:43,367
Yeah... show me.

749
00:44:50,877 --> 00:44:53,839
Holy shit.

750
00:44:55,049 --> 00:44:57,094
Oh, God...

751
00:44:57,136 --> 00:45:02,309
Oh, let me tell you, the world is very different pace,
when you're not constantly thinking about sex.

752
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,394
or responding sexually to everything...

753
00:45:04,436 --> 00:45:06,771
Yeah.

754
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:09,610
I go to guess that'd would be.

755
00:45:09,652 --> 00:45:11,696
Wait, how would you know?

756
00:45:11,738 --> 00:45:14,825
How would you know,
what it's like to not have something, you never had?

757
00:45:14,866 --> 00:45:16,911
Now you're thinking.

758
00:45:16,952 --> 00:45:20,039
You'd be surprised,
how many people take that statement on faith.

759
00:45:20,081 --> 00:45:23,169
Sounds right,
so they just except it.

760
00:45:23,211 --> 00:45:24,212
As I say.

761
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:28,384
Messing with peoples heads,
can be a lot of fun.

762
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:30,470
You should try it.

763
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:34,266
Some nice scenery coming up ahead.

764
00:45:48,243 --> 00:45:51,330
Hello then...
you're going my way?

765
00:45:51,372 --> 00:45:53,416
If you're going west.

766
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:54,459
Then, that's my way.

767
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:58,632
Hey, why don't you hop in the back,
because huggy here is gonna wanna take a good luck at me,

768
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,760
and if I'm in the front,
he'll have a better view.

769
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:06,557
And if you're in the back...
so will you.

770
00:46:11,189 --> 00:46:12,191
I'm Laura.

771
00:46:12,232 --> 00:46:13,233
Neal.

772
00:46:13,275 --> 00:46:16,321
Oh, and that's Mr. Grant.

773
00:46:16,404 --> 00:46:18,448
So, where you going Laura?

774
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:19,491
Me?

775
00:46:19,533 --> 00:46:22,244
Oh, I'm going to a...

776
00:46:22,663 --> 00:46:26,333
find a perfect fuck.

777
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:28,878
Wow, that's an interesting destination.

778
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,921
Yeah, ever been there?

779
00:46:29,963 --> 00:46:32,007
- Can't say that I have.
- Me either.

780
00:46:32,049 --> 00:46:36,013
But so far the trip's been pretty exciting.

781
00:46:36,055 --> 00:46:39,309
Only, how will you know,
when you've gotten there?

782
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:42,437
That is the problem.
It's actually become my obsession,

783
00:46:42,479 --> 00:46:46,358
but you don't need to here about it.

784
00:46:46,652 --> 00:46:47,653
Sure, sure I do.

785
00:46:47,695 --> 00:46:50,198
The first time, wasn't that great.

786
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:51,448
I'm thinking:
This is it?

787
00:46:51,866 --> 00:46:55,996
This is what all these songs are written about?
I mean, talk about hype.

788
00:46:56,038 --> 00:46:58,082
Second time was a little bit better.

789
00:46:58,124 --> 00:47:02,088
Third time, now that was a hot time.

790
00:47:02,297 --> 00:47:05,384
Forth time, not as good as the third time.

791
00:47:05,425 --> 00:47:10,598
But once I've done it enough to have all these
expiriences to compare, just drove me nuts.

792
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,728
I mean,
what if the best one was right around the corner?

793
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:17,733
You know, how much better,
would the perfect one be?

794
00:47:17,941 --> 00:47:19,986
So this became my quest.

795
00:47:20,027 --> 00:47:23,114
No, there is times,
when wish I've gone to the convent.

796
00:47:23,156 --> 00:47:27,287
But my obsession,
becomes your opportunities.

797
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:32,919
You little stun muffin.
You want to take advantage of a girl that can't say no?

798
00:47:33,586 --> 00:47:35,631
Any guy turned you down before?

799
00:47:35,673 --> 00:47:39,261
Not unless he was gay.

800
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:45,393
OK...
What number would I be?

801
00:47:49,232 --> 00:47:51,652
2461.

802
00:47:54,447 --> 00:47:58,577
But I have got a very,
very good hearing about you,

803
00:47:58,618 --> 00:48:02,666
and there's something very, very special.

804
00:48:04,042 --> 00:48:06,921
- I think I'm gonna pass, Laura.
- What do you mean, you will pass?

805
00:48:06,963 --> 00:48:10,425
Guys don't pass.

806
00:48:10,467 --> 00:48:14,223
Oh, I'm clean, there is no disease,
if that's what you're worried about.

807
00:48:14,264 --> 00:48:18,728
I've got condoms...
all best kinds.

808
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:23,067
Come on Neal...
stick it to me.

809
00:48:30,952 --> 00:48:32,996
I'm not doing it. Period.

810
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:35,082
So, you just.
You are not man enough?

811
00:48:35,124 --> 00:48:39,255
You meet a real woman
and you turn in to a wuss?

812
00:48:39,297 --> 00:48:41,341
Think you want measure up, hmmm?

813
00:48:41,382 --> 00:48:43,427
Well, you'll never know,
will you?

814
00:48:43,468 --> 00:48:45,512
Because if I don't do it...

815
00:48:45,554 --> 00:48:48,641
I want be number 2000 and whatever.

816
00:48:48,683 --> 00:48:49,685
I'll be number One.

817
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:52,814
That one guy.
Guy you will remember for the rest of your life.

818
00:48:52,856 --> 00:48:55,943
You stay up at night,
thinking about me, wondering,

819
00:48:55,984 --> 00:48:58,028
Was he the One?

820
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:01,157
The answer is yes.
I am the perfect fuck.

821
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,201
The one you never had...

822
00:49:02,243 --> 00:49:03,244
Perfect on every way...

823
00:49:03,286 --> 00:49:06,373
Look, stop it, stop it...

824
00:49:06,415 --> 00:49:09,502
This is Zen thing, it's amazing...
I've never been perfect in anything before.

825
00:49:09,543 --> 00:49:12,630
Well, you can fuck me.

826
00:49:12,672 --> 00:49:15,760
A mind fuck, and it was terrible.

827
00:49:15,802 --> 00:49:17,846
It was good for me.

828
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:19,138
What about you Mr.?

829
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,975
I'll bet,
you're a real man.

830
00:49:21,017 --> 00:49:23,061
You're man enough to be in my book?

831
00:49:23,102 --> 00:49:25,146
Oh, Hell yes.
Put me down in there.

832
00:49:25,188 --> 00:49:30,279
But I sometimes got little troubles...
getting excited.

833
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:35,452
Let me take care of that baby.

834
00:49:58,565 --> 00:50:03,155
Now, that's a museum you'd really appreciate.

835
00:50:05,866 --> 00:50:07,910
What is it? A bunch of bogus paintings

836
00:50:07,952 --> 00:50:09,996
Stop in Renburg.  Have a look.

837
00:50:10,038 --> 00:50:14,711
You'll find it very...
thought provoking.

838
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:19,384
450 mile to  Danver.

839
00:50:19,425 --> 00:50:22,512
Quarter tank of gas, and no money.

840
00:50:22,554 --> 00:50:28,311
Well, when Columbus set sail,
he didn't know if it had any wind.

841
00:50:30,898 --> 00:50:31,900
Stop!

842
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:34,862
Help. Stop!

843
00:50:36,113 --> 00:50:37,114
Jesus lady...

844
00:50:37,156 --> 00:50:41,287
Help my, please, my son...
took my car and run off.  I think he's in Banton.

845
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,373
Will you take me there?
I've got to find him.

846
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,459
Look I'm sorry,
but I'm not going that way.

847
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,587
I'll pay you... $53.
It's all I have just take me to Banton.

848
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:50,089
Help my find my son, please.

849
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:52,760
You need money.
She shows up.

850
00:50:52,802 --> 00:50:56,055
Coincidence?

851
00:50:56,974 --> 00:51:00,061
All right lady, hop in. I'll take you.
- Thank you

852
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:02,146
Well, I'll hop out.

853
00:51:02,188 --> 00:51:05,109
You're gettin' in tune with the highway.

854
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:07,237
Say,

855
00:51:07,279 --> 00:51:10,031
that's important.

856
00:51:15,747 --> 00:51:17,792
Good luck Neal.

857
00:51:17,834 --> 00:51:19,878
Hey, wait a minute. Am I gonna see you again?

858
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,964
Always wanting an answer.

859
00:51:22,006 --> 00:51:25,843
Well, maybe you'll find it in Banton.

860
00:51:32,436 --> 00:51:36,566
I'll pay you the rest,
when we'll find Philip.

861
00:51:36,608 --> 00:51:38,652
Oh, I'm Susan Ross.

862
00:51:38,693 --> 00:51:41,530
Neal Oliver.

863
00:51:41,823 --> 00:51:45,118
- So, how old is Philip, Susan?
- 16.

864
00:51:45,995 --> 00:51:48,039
He's my baby.

865
00:51:48,081 --> 00:51:50,125
He's all I have.

866
00:51:50,167 --> 00:51:54,339
He's run away before,
but he's always come back.

867
00:51:54,339 --> 00:51:55,341
God I am so scared...

868
00:51:55,382 --> 00:51:57,426
What if I never find him?

869
00:51:57,468 --> 00:52:01,598
- Well, did you call the Police?
- They say I should look in Banton

870
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,727
It's not like I've been a bad mother.

871
00:52:04,769 --> 00:52:08,900
it's just...
so hard when you're all alone.

872
00:52:08,941 --> 00:52:10,985
We're gonna find him Susan.

873
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:13,779
We'll find him.

874
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:26,630
<i>It is illegal to sell,
consume, or transport Euphoria,</i>

875
00:52:26,672 --> 00:52:29,760
<i>beyond the city limits, under penalty of law.</i>

876
00:52:29,802 --> 00:52:31,846
<i>Be warned, it is highly addictive.</i>

877
00:52:31,888 --> 00:52:33,932
<i>Even in small doses.</i>

878

<i>Withdraw from Euphoria, has known to cause injury and death.</i>

879

<i>All responsible citizens, are urged to avoid this drug at all costs,

880
00:52:47,532 --> 00:52:52,392
<i>Euphoria is legal in Banton,

881
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:53,019
<i>- However ...</i>

882
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,628
What kind of town is this?

883
00:52:55,733 --> 00:52:58,966
<i> it is illegal to sell, consume ..</i>

884
00:53:01,091 --> 00:53:03,136
Maybe we should talk to the Police?

885
00:53:03,177 --> 00:53:04,179
Come on.

886
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:09,394
16-year-old,
in town with legal drugs, and a rave.

887
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:13,399
Sorry,
but I don't think he'll be at the library.

888
00:53:36,554 --> 00:53:44,063
The next bus to the rave is leaving in five minutes...
The next bus to the rave is leaving in five minutes.

889
00:54:20,361 --> 00:54:23,281
First timers?

890
00:54:23,489 --> 00:54:26,577
Are you aware,
that Euphoria is being distributed inside,

891
00:54:26,618 --> 00:54:31,791
that it is dangerous, and addictive substance,
and it is strongly advised not to partake of it?

892
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:33,878
Well, how can we not be?

893
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,630
Go on.

894
00:55:16,683 --> 00:55:17,684
You'll need this.

895
00:55:17,726 --> 00:55:19,770
No, thanks.

896
00:55:19,811 --> 00:55:22,858
Don't be stupid.

897
00:55:22,941 --> 00:55:23,942
This is the answer.

898
00:55:23,984 --> 00:55:26,028
This is to everything.

899
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:29,157
And you really need it.

900
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:31,243
Susan!

901
00:55:31,285 --> 00:55:34,038
He's over here.

902
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,458
Philip.

903
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,544
Oh, thank God,
we've found you.

904
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:39,587
Please, let's go home.

905
00:55:39,629 --> 00:55:41,673
Chill ma, I am home.

906
00:55:41,715 --> 00:55:44,802
See this? This is the place.
The happiest place on earth.

907
00:55:44,844 --> 00:55:46,889
You can't stay here.
You have to come home.

908
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:47,932
But Mom!

909
00:55:47,973 --> 00:55:48,975
Who's this?

910
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:51,060
New stud boyfriend?

911
00:55:51,102 --> 00:55:52,562
Sure can pick 'em.

912
00:55:52,604 --> 00:55:54,189
- You've got school.
- Fuck school.

913
00:55:54,231 --> 00:55:56,275
I've got Euphoria.

914
00:55:56,317 --> 00:55:58,362
Here, try some mom, the best.

915
00:55:58,404 --> 00:56:00,448
Philip.
You can't stay here.

916
00:56:00,489 --> 00:56:02,867
Yo, I'm in legal age here.

917
00:56:02,909 --> 00:56:05,662
I can do anything I want.
I want... Euphoria.

918
00:56:05,704 --> 00:56:07,372
You stole my car.

919
00:56:07,413 --> 00:56:08,791
It's in the impound yard. Take it.

920
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,878
I don't want it.  Eat it.

921
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,964
No, you take me there.

922
00:56:13,006 --> 00:56:15,050
Go away. Leave me alone

923
00:56:15,091 --> 00:56:16,717
Hey, what's a matter with you?

924
00:56:16,759 --> 00:56:19,263
What's going on her?
Hey, now break it up.

925
00:56:19,304 --> 00:56:20,264
Philip come home.

926
00:56:20,306 --> 00:56:23,227
- That's it.
- Philip! Philip! Please come home.

927
00:56:23,436 --> 00:56:27,566
The fact is ma'am, here your son's legal age.

928
00:56:27,607 --> 00:56:31,737
He wants to stay...
He can't be forced to leave.

929
00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:33,823
And...

930
00:56:33,865 --> 00:56:36,911
He wants to stay.

931
00:56:36,995 --> 00:56:39,039
No, they all do.  They're addicts.

932
00:56:39,081 --> 00:56:42,168
But he's just a boy.
He didn't know what he was doing.

933
00:56:42,209 --> 00:56:43,211
Oh, no no.

934
00:56:43,252 --> 00:56:44,254
He knew.

935
00:56:44,295 --> 00:56:47,800
They all knew,
that's why there are all those warnings posted all over town.

936
00:56:47,842 --> 00:56:50,512
Yeah, but if this drug is so addictive,
why is it legal?

937
00:56:50,554 --> 00:56:52,598
Son...

938
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,684
This town had serious drug problem.

939
00:56:54,725 --> 00:56:56,770
And all the problems that go along with it.

940
00:56:56,811 --> 00:56:57,813
We tried everything.

941
00:56:57,854 --> 00:57:01,985
Punishment for dealing, punishment for using.
More enforcement,

942
00:57:02,027 --> 00:57:06,157
tougher enforcement, jail,
hell, public humiliation.

943
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:09,286
But, it all came down to one thing.

944
00:57:09,327 --> 00:57:12,415
Some folks...  just wanna get high.

945
00:57:12,457 --> 00:57:13,458
So...

946
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,587
We came up with a radical solution...

947
00:57:16,629 --> 00:57:18,673
Euphoria.

948
00:57:18,715 --> 00:57:22,845
Synthetic drug.  Potent, legal,
and totally addictive,

949
00:57:22,886 --> 00:57:24,932
and we warn everyone, not to use it.

950
00:57:24,973 --> 00:57:29,103
But like I said,
some folks just wanna get high.

951
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:31,189
One hit of this, and you are hooked.

952
00:57:31,231 --> 00:57:33,275
And we own them.

953
00:57:33,317 --> 00:57:38,491
Camp controls the supplies
so of course we can set the prize, and we made it very affordable.

954
00:57:38,532 --> 00:57:41,619
Live in our camps, eat our food, and ...
you know, just do a couple of off jobs,

955
00:57:41,661 --> 00:57:45,791
pick up spome trash, mow the lawn,
clean some toilets, and you get your Euphoria.

956
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:49,712
And at night, man... party till you drop.

957
00:57:50,005 --> 00:57:54,970
The thrall is so intense,
that everybody pays the price.

958
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,264
It's an incredible achievement, really.

959
00:57:57,306 --> 00:58:00,394
Drug so powerful that it sublimates the sex drive.

960
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:02,480
You know, how many rapes we had here last year?

961
00:58:02,522 --> 00:58:04,566
None.

962
00:58:04,607 --> 00:58:09,780
Are you saying Philip's going to be cleaning
toilettes for the rest of his life?

963
00:58:09,822 --> 00:58:11,866
With no sex drive?

964
00:58:11,908 --> 00:58:13,953
He'll never marry.

965
00:58:13,995 --> 00:58:16,039
I'll never have grandchildren?

966
00:58:16,081 --> 00:58:18,125
It's ironic, isn't it?

967
00:58:18,166 --> 00:58:20,211
Americans fought a war for freedom...

968
00:58:20,252 --> 00:58:22,296
another one to end slavery.

969
00:58:22,338 --> 00:58:24,382
What someone would choose to do with their freedom?

970
00:58:24,424 --> 00:58:27,512
Become slaves.

971
00:58:27,554 --> 00:58:30,641
But they're human beings.
They have rights.

972
00:58:30,682 --> 00:58:32,727
They didn't know what they be given up.

973
00:58:32,768 --> 00:58:35,855
They made a choice.

974
00:58:35,897 --> 00:58:37,942
But look at them.

975
00:58:37,984 --> 00:58:40,028
They seem miserable to you?

976
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:42,114
They live a simple, happy life.

977
00:58:42,156 --> 00:58:45,243
No decisions... no responsibilities...

978
00:58:45,284 --> 00:58:47,329
No problems...

979
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:50,458
They found their answer.

980
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,587
You so sure,
that your life is better than theirs?

981
00:58:53,629 --> 00:58:55,673
It's like theyre animals.

982
00:58:55,715 --> 00:58:57,759
Oh yeah, we're all animals.

983
00:58:57,801 --> 00:59:02,474
Just that, some of us have different priorities.
That's all.

984
00:59:12,402 --> 00:59:18,494
Whatever your priorities are,
Banton is a really nice place to live.

985
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:23,834
No, it's a nightmare.
Please, I want my son back.

986
00:59:23,876 --> 00:59:24,877
I'll do anything.

987
00:59:24,919 --> 00:59:26,964
All right than.
It comes down to three choices.

988
00:59:27,005 --> 00:59:29,050
One.
You move here to the Euphoria free zone,

989
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:31,135
and that way,
you at least have the chance to see him.

990
00:59:31,177 --> 00:59:34,264
Hell, some parents
end up having their children work for them.

991
00:59:34,306 --> 00:59:36,350
Kind of perverse pay back.

992
00:59:36,392 --> 00:59:38,437
Two. You go home.

993
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:42,609
Try to find something else
to make your life worth a while.

994
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:45,696
Or three...

995
00:59:45,779 --> 00:59:49,491
Join the party.

996
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,125
What should I do?

997
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:59,338
You're smart... tell me what to do.

998
01:00:00,381 --> 01:00:01,382
I don't know.

999
01:00:01,424 --> 01:00:04,512
I guess, if it was me...

1000
01:00:04,554 --> 01:00:06,598
I'd want to see my boy.

1001
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,725
But he doesn't want to see me.

1002
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:27,458
Oh, my God...

1003
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,742
It's wonderful...

1004
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:38,354
I... feel so... beautiful...

1005
01:00:40,066 --> 01:00:44,170
I never knew, I can be so...

1006
01:00:44,172 --> 01:00:45,817
happy.

1007
01:00:52,554 --> 01:00:54,226
Well, how about you son?

1008
01:00:57,462 --> 01:01:00,422
You want some?

1009
01:01:11,014 --> 01:01:12,015
No thanks.

1010
01:01:12,057 --> 01:01:14,643
I'll pass.

1011
01:01:16,226 --> 01:01:18,604
It's Ives here.
We've got a rookie in my office,

1012
01:01:18,645 --> 01:01:20,856
and I've short shifted the
cleaning gall again.

1013
01:01:20,898 --> 01:01:23,483
Send in the zoo keeper.
- Roger that

1014
01:01:23,525 --> 01:01:25,568
Well, guess you'll need a hotel room for the night.

1015
01:01:25,609 --> 01:01:29,738
Plus, you get...
a 300 dollars finders fee.

1016
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:30,781
Finders fee?

1017
01:01:30,823 --> 01:01:33,783
Yeah, for her.

1018
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:35,993
You've just increased our labour-pool.

1019
01:01:36,035 --> 01:01:39,121
We pay for that, around here.

1020
01:01:39,163 --> 01:01:41,206
What's the matter son?

1021
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:45,543
Somebody offers you an advantage... take it.

1022
01:01:49,588 --> 01:01:51,631
I took the room, but not the money.

1023
01:01:51,673 --> 01:01:52,674
I couldn't.

1024
01:01:52,716 --> 01:01:54,759
And even then I didn't sleep very well.

1025
01:01:54,801 --> 01:01:56,844
I never got the rest of the 53 bucks, but,

1026
01:01:56,885 --> 01:01:58,929
given the dynamics of Interstate 60,

1027
01:01:58,971 --> 01:01:59,972
I wasn't concerned.

1028
01:02:00,013 --> 01:02:02,057
I knew something would be just down the road.

1029
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:03,100
It was inevitable.

1030
01:02:03,141 --> 01:02:08,729
What did concern me,
was whether something else was inevitable.

1031
01:02:09,396 --> 01:02:14,483
Eight Ball, should I be worried about this.. killer?

1032
01:02:17,737 --> 01:02:19,780
Can you be more specific?

1033
01:02:22,949 --> 01:02:25,409
Figures.

1034
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:30,205
The inevitable something down the road,
was 20 miles ahead,

1035
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:33,291
and he was quite the character.

1036
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:36,210
What's the deal there, mister?

1037
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:39,171
Hey, Bob Cody.

1038
01:02:39,629 --> 01:02:40,630
I don't drive.

1039
01:02:40,672 --> 01:02:42,132
And I don't like to hitch-hike.

1040
01:02:42,174 --> 01:02:46,885
When hitch-hike, I'm at the mercy of the driver.
But when I pay for the ride, I'm the employer, and I call the shots.

1041
01:02:46,927 --> 01:02:48,971
That's how I like it.

1042
01:02:49,012 --> 01:02:51,056
So.. you wonna work for me?

1043
01:02:51,098 --> 01:02:54,183
Well, I'm going to Danver.
I wouldn't mind making some money.

1044
01:02:54,225 --> 01:02:56,268
Good. I'm going to Renburg.
It's on your way.

1045
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,354
Here's mine proposition.

1046
01:02:58,395 --> 01:03:02,523
You pay for gas, pay for your meals.
No alcohol while you're on payroll.

1047
01:03:02,565 --> 01:03:06,694
I pick radio stations.  I initiate all conversations.

1048
01:03:06,736 --> 01:03:08,779
I'll pay you ten dollars cash every hour.

1049
01:03:08,821 --> 01:03:10,864
And the mileage money,
when we get to Renburg.

1050
01:03:10,905 --> 01:03:16,369
In all other matters...
You play straight with me, I'll play straight with you.

1051
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:18,161
So, we have a contract?

1052
01:03:18,203 --> 01:03:21,164
We have a contract.

1053
01:03:26,543 --> 01:03:28,587
So, who is my new employee?

1054
01:03:28,629 --> 01:03:29,629
Neal Oliver.

1055
01:03:29,671 --> 01:03:32,757
Mr. Oliver, you may call me Mr. Cody.

1056
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:35,426
Or Sir.

1057
01:03:35,926 --> 01:03:38,971
You got it, Sir.

1058
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:43,182
He was going to Renburg.
The museum of art fraud was in Renburg.

1059
01:03:43,224 --> 01:03:44,225
Coincidence?

1060
01:03:44,266 --> 01:03:47,353
I knew then that I'd had to check out that museum.

1061
01:03:47,394 --> 01:03:48,395
It was inevitable.

1062
01:03:48,437 --> 01:03:53,691
Mr. Cody had rather unique tastes in audio stimulation.

1063
01:03:53,691 --> 01:03:59,863
<i>The choice is clear. The Orient 620.
The American made car, for American made drivers...</i>

1064
01:03:59,904 --> 01:04:05,034
See, that's a lie.
Orient engines are made in Japan.

1065
01:04:08,453 --> 01:04:13,416
<i>Guilt Signal.
The movie everyone's talking about...</i>

1066
01:04:14,542 --> 01:04:19,338
That's another lie.
We're not talking about it.

1067
01:04:19,713 --> 01:04:22,632
<i>We're the United State's Post Office.
We care...</i>

1068
01:04:22,965 --> 01:04:28,012
Oh, that's the biggest whopper of all.

1069
01:04:28,053 --> 01:04:32,181
You know, sometimes only that chairman will do.

1070
01:04:32,223 --> 01:04:38,437
<i>I get no kick from champagne...
(Frank Sinatra's - Kick out of you)</i>

1071
01:04:38,479 --> 01:04:40,521
There's an advert I can't figure.

1072
01:04:40,563 --> 01:04:43,649
What's warmer, the weather, the water... girl?

1073
01:04:43,691 --> 01:04:44,692
She's pretty, though.

1074
01:04:44,734 --> 01:04:46,777
She's Robin Fields.

1075
01:04:46,819 --> 01:04:47,819
She's gorgeous.

1076
01:04:47,861 --> 01:04:48,862
Sir.

1077
01:04:48,903 --> 01:04:50,947
Well, you know her?

1078
01:04:50,989 --> 01:04:53,032
Not yet.
I'm meeting her in Danver.

1079
01:04:53,074 --> 01:04:56,034
You're a lucky man.

1080
01:04:56,201 --> 01:04:58,704
Yeah, to be honest, I'm a little nervous about it...

1081
01:04:58,745 --> 01:05:00,330
Cos', you know,
what am I gonna say?

1082
01:05:00,372 --> 01:05:04,500
How do you start a conversation with the girl of
your dreams, without coming off like a total dork?

1083
01:05:04,541 --> 01:05:07,377
Don't say anything.

1084
01:05:07,669 --> 01:05:10,881
Let her start.

1085
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,883
That's, a good idea.

1086
01:05:13,924 --> 01:05:17,887
Sit back.
Listen to sweet musical tones of her voice.

1087
01:05:17,928 --> 01:05:19,096
Son, you got a bag.

1088
01:05:19,138 --> 01:05:22,473
Yes sir, I do.

1089
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:31,022
<i> I get a kick out of youuuuuuuuuu....
</i>

1090
01:05:33,733 --> 01:05:37,861
Now there's a sign that's
telling the truth, for a change.

1091
01:05:37,903 --> 01:05:39,946
Yeah, looks like a motel to me.

1092
01:05:39,988 --> 01:05:43,074
No, Frontier... ever hear of
Frederick Turner Mr Oliver?

1093
01:05:43,116 --> 01:05:44,117
No sir.

1094
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:47,244
Well, he was an historian.

1095
01:05:47,286 --> 01:05:50,372
About a hundred years ago,
he came up with the theory about the Frontier.

1096
01:05:50,414 --> 01:05:54,541
Said, the Frontier was a...
safety valve for civilization.

1097
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:57,669
Place for people to go,
to keep them from going mad.

1098
01:05:57,711 --> 01:05:58,712
So...

1099
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:01,839
wherever were folks, who
couldn't fit in with ways things were...

1100
01:06:01,881 --> 01:06:06,010
Nuts, malcontents, extremists...

1101
01:06:06,051 --> 01:06:09,137
They'd packed up and head for the frontier.
So America got started.

1102
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:12,265
All the crackpots and
trouble makers in Europe,

1103
01:06:12,306 --> 01:06:14,350
packed up, and went to a frontier,

1104
01:06:14,392 --> 01:06:17,477
which became, The Thirteen Colonies...

1105
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:20,605
When some people couldn't fit in with that,
they moved further west.

1106
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:25,651
Which is why all the nuts
eventually ended up in California.

1107
01:06:26,902 --> 01:06:29,988
Turner died in 1932, so ...

1108
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:33,116
He was around long enough
to see what would happen to the World,

1109
01:06:33,158 --> 01:06:36,243
when we ran out of frontier.

1110
01:06:36,285 --> 01:06:39,371
Some people say,
we had a frontier in the mind.

1111
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:45,084
And they go off and explore the wonderful
world of alcohol, and drugs, but,

1112
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:46,669
that's no frontier.

1113
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:50,838
It's just another way for us
to fool ourselves...

1114
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,966
And we've created this phoney frontier
with computers.

1115
01:06:54,008 --> 01:06:58,136
Which allows people to think theyve escaped...

1116
01:06:58,178 --> 01:07:01,264
Frontier with access fees...

1117
01:07:01,306 --> 01:07:04,392
What about Space?
The final frontier?

1118
01:07:04,434 --> 01:07:07,519
Ah, Star Trek isn't Space.
That's television.

1119
01:07:07,561 --> 01:07:10,647
Find fuckin' frontier, that is.

1120
01:07:10,689 --> 01:07:16,902
Besides, how many folks can just pack up,
and go to space?

1121
01:07:16,943 --> 01:07:20,030
Naah, the frontier is right here.

1122
01:07:20,071 --> 01:07:23,157
Interstate 60.

1123
01:07:23,198 --> 01:07:25,242
That's why it was put here.

1124
01:07:25,284 --> 01:07:28,370
Give people, who wanted a little different,

1125
01:07:28,412 --> 01:07:30,454
place to go.

1126
01:07:30,496 --> 01:07:32,540
Is that really true Mr Cody?

1127
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:36,502
If it isn't... it should be.

1128
01:07:48,219 --> 01:07:51,306
Excuse me... Excuse me...

1129
01:07:51,347 --> 01:07:53,391
Excuse my...

1130
01:07:53,433 --> 01:07:56,518
Can you help me out mister?

1131
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,436
Will work for food, eh?

1132
01:07:58,436 --> 01:08:03,774
OK...
Here's an apple, food.

1133
01:08:04,483 --> 01:08:07,986
Now, I'd like you washed
that man's windshield.

1134
01:08:08,028 --> 01:08:09,029
Work.

1135
01:08:09,071 --> 01:08:12,156
Hey man.  I ain't gonna
wash his windshield for no apple.

1136
01:08:12,198 --> 01:08:16,327
Oh, excuse me.
It doesn't say "might work for food",

1137
01:08:16,368 --> 01:08:19,453
It doesn't say "restricted menus", it says
"will work for food".  This is food,

1138
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:20,496
That's work.

1139
01:08:20,538 --> 01:08:22,581
What's the problem?

1140
01:08:22,623 --> 01:08:24,667
I ain't doin' it,
that's all.

1141
01:08:24,709 --> 01:08:28,836
Now, let's be honest.
You don't want to work.

1142
01:08:28,878 --> 01:08:31,964
You just want a hand out,
so you can buy booze.

1143
01:08:32,006 --> 01:08:35,092
And nothing wrong with that.  Drinking...
that's a great human tradition.

1144
01:08:35,134 --> 01:08:38,219
And if you'd been straight about it,
I'd bought you some Chevas.

1145
01:08:38,261 --> 01:08:42,390
But by holding up that sign.
You made an employment agreement.

1146
01:08:42,432 --> 01:08:44,474
Which I intend to hold you to.

1147
01:08:44,516 --> 01:08:48,603
Now...
There's the apple, you wash that car.

1148
01:08:49,729 --> 01:08:52,815
Fuck you man.
I don't want your fuckin apple,

1149
01:08:52,856 --> 01:08:54,900
so I don't gotta wash that fuckin car.

1150
01:08:54,942 --> 01:08:59,529
Here's what I think of your fuckin apple.

1151
01:09:02,448 --> 01:09:08,619
Well, now since you've took my food.
You gotta wash that car.

1152
01:09:09,537 --> 01:09:10,538
Wash it.

1153
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:13,666
- Mr. Cody, this is really unimportant.
-Yes it is.

1154
01:09:13,708 --> 01:09:17,836
This jerk out here lying in writing?!
I don't tolerate lying from any one!

1155
01:09:17,877 --> 01:09:19,921
Especially not in writing.

1156
01:09:19,963 --> 01:09:22,006
You!
Watch the damn car.

1157
01:09:22,048 --> 01:09:24,092
You, shot the fuck up!

1158
01:09:24,133 --> 01:09:25,383
Or I'm gonna cut you.

1159
01:09:25,425 --> 01:09:27,219
You all get out of here, now!

1160
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:28,261
I'm gonna call the sheriff.

1161
01:09:28,303 --> 01:09:30,347
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

1162
01:09:30,388 --> 01:09:34,474
You see, I've got lung cancer.
I'm terminal, six months to live.

1163
01:09:34,558 --> 01:09:38,603
Only...
I'm not going out in a hospital.

1164
01:09:38,729 --> 01:09:39,730
It's dynamite.

1165
01:09:39,771 --> 01:09:43,899
Enough to take out everything
in radius of 150 yards.

1166
01:09:43,941 --> 01:09:47,027
I don't take two farts in a martini,
if I go now or later.

1167
01:09:47,069 --> 01:09:52,239
But if you do,
you'd better wash that car.

1168
01:09:52,281 --> 01:09:54,325
OK, OK mister... I'll clean it for you.

1169
01:09:54,366 --> 01:09:56,410
No!

1170
01:09:56,452 --> 01:09:57,452
He's got to do it.

1171
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:59,537
What are you nuts?
Wash the windshield.

1172
01:09:59,579 --> 01:10:00,580
Clean it!

1173
01:10:00,621 --> 01:10:02,665
Wash the car.

1174
01:10:02,707 --> 01:10:05,792
OK, OK! I'll wash it, all right!

1175
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:08,545
Turn it of.

1176
01:10:13,131 --> 01:10:17,260
You'd rather call the sheriff,
and have that guy shot through the head. He's crazy.

1177
01:10:17,302 --> 01:10:21,513
I've got much simpler solution.

1178
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:30,479
<i>Grab your cote, and snatch your hat.
Leave your worries on the door step.</i>

1179
01:10:30,521 --> 01:10:38,152
<i>Just direct your feet, to the sunny side of the street.</i>

1180
01:10:38,152 --> 01:10:42,323
Say what you mean, mean what you say.

1181
01:10:42,323 --> 01:10:48,536
You know, if everybody followed that rule,
there would be a lot less trouble.

1182
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:51,664
Now, we still have a contract Mr. Oliver.

1183
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:55,834
Sure hope,
you're not thinking of breaking that contract.

1184
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:58,712
Thinking about it?
Yes.

1185
01:10:59,004 --> 01:11:02,130
Doing it?
No, sir.

1186
01:11:04,216 --> 01:11:06,259
That's a very honest response.

1187
01:11:06,301 --> 01:11:10,262
That's a breath of fresh air.

1188
01:11:10,471 --> 01:11:11,472
Cigarette?

1189
01:11:11,513 --> 01:11:14,600
No, Thank you sir. I don't smoke.

1190
01:11:14,641 --> 01:11:17,728
I like cigarettes.

1191
01:11:17,769 --> 01:11:20,855
Package says they cause cancer,
and they do.

1192
01:11:20,896 --> 01:11:25,067
Say what you mean, mean what you say.

1193
01:11:25,067 --> 01:11:28,152
Nor, for one, for cigarettes,
I don't know where I'd be today.

1194
01:11:28,194 --> 01:11:30,238
I used to be in advertising.

1195
01:11:30,279 --> 01:11:33,366
I got paid for lying.

1196
01:11:33,407 --> 01:11:37,535
And one day, a little boy died
because of one of those lies.

1197
01:11:37,577 --> 01:11:40,663
Well, that fried me.

1198
01:11:40,705 --> 01:11:46,918
So, when I got my nicotine death sentence,
I decided to make the rest of my time count.

1199
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,046
Put and end on some of those lies.

1200
01:11:50,088 --> 01:11:55,801
Now, for the first time on my life,
I'm fulfilled, I'm content.

1201
01:11:57,386 --> 01:11:59,428
Lung cancer.

1202
01:11:59,470 --> 01:12:02,681
Is now without its benefits.

1203
01:12:03,641 --> 01:12:06,727
I couldn't decide if he was for real,
or bluffing.

1204
01:12:06,769 --> 01:12:08,811
Totally sane or completely nuts.

1205
01:12:08,853 --> 01:12:10,896
Maybe the dynamite was fake,
or the detonator was.

1206
01:12:10,938 --> 01:12:12,982
Or... maybe not.

1207
01:12:13,024 --> 01:12:16,109
As Grant would say,
lots of answers, all of them reasonable.

1208
01:12:16,150 --> 01:12:18,861
I did know that I liked it.
That was for sure.

1209
01:12:18,903 --> 01:12:29,287
<i>Sunny side of the streeeeeeeeeeeeeeet......
</i>

1210
01:12:30,747 --> 01:12:32,789
Mister Oliver.

1211
01:12:32,831 --> 01:12:35,917
You're one of the best employees I've ever had.

1212
01:12:35,959 --> 01:12:38,003
I'm giving you a tip.

1213
01:12:38,044 --> 01:12:41,130
And my card.

1214
01:12:41,171 --> 01:12:43,215
You ever want to work for me again.

1215
01:12:43,257 --> 01:12:45,300
You call that number.

1216
01:12:45,342 --> 01:12:48,427
It's mine direct line.

1217
01:12:48,469 --> 01:12:52,473
- Good luck with that girl.
- Thank you sir.

1218
01:12:55,768 --> 01:12:58,853
The Museum of Art Fraud
was only three blocks away.

1219
01:12:58,895 --> 01:13:01,981
That Interstate 60 dynamic was clearly at work again.

1220
01:13:02,023 --> 01:13:05,108
And my own curiosity was definitely piqued.

1221
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:07,193
Oh, you must be Douglas.

1222
01:13:07,235 --> 01:13:10,321
Oh, thank goodness,
I'm so glad to see you.

1223
01:13:10,363 --> 01:13:14,491
I didn't think you were coming.
I mean, the agency called to cancel.

1224
01:13:14,533 --> 01:13:15,534
I'm Mrs. James. The owner.

1225
01:13:15,575 --> 01:13:16,785
Hi Mrs. James...

1226
01:13:16,826 --> 01:13:20,746
And today we're viewing the originals, and right now...
I know you're confused...

1227
01:13:20,788 --> 01:13:24,916
But if you do as I say,
I'll give you a hundred dollars.

1228
01:13:24,958 --> 01:13:29,086
Late Mr. James was most proud of five original
masterpieces in this room.

1229
01:13:29,128 --> 01:13:33,257
Rarely seen,
and per his wishes never photographed.

1230
01:13:33,298 --> 01:13:37,885
Monet...Cezanne...
Van Gogh... Renoir...

1231
01:13:38,511 --> 01:13:39,512
Degas...

1232
01:13:39,553 --> 01:13:41,597
Each is valued in the millions.

1233
01:13:41,639 --> 01:13:44,724
No less then Bill Gates and
Warren Buffet have attempted to buy them.

1234
01:13:44,766 --> 01:13:48,728
Of course they're not for sale.

1235
01:13:48,936 --> 01:13:50,605
Now if we can proceed this way...

1236
01:13:58,528 --> 01:14:03,490
Now, take the paintings down very carefully,
remove them from the frames.

1237
01:14:03,532 --> 01:14:07,869
And then, after that...
put them on the easels out here.

1238
01:14:08,745 --> 01:14:10,788
Today you're going to be my nephew Edward.

1239
01:14:10,829 --> 01:14:15,000
Now, just follow my lead,
and go with the flow.

1240
01:14:18,127 --> 01:14:20,171
This way please.

1241
01:14:20,212 --> 01:14:23,299
Welcome ladies and gentlemen...

1242
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:27,468
Welcome to our gallery of affordable reproductions...

1243
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:33,723
It was my late husband's request,
That none of his five original masterpieces,

1244
01:14:33,765 --> 01:14:38,936
ever be photographed
or reproduced in any book or catalogue.

1245
01:14:38,978 --> 01:14:42,063
So, we offer these copies...

1246
01:14:42,105 --> 01:14:46,234
Rendered by my nephew Edward.

1247
01:14:46,276 --> 01:14:50,320
At the modest cost of $350 a piece.

1248
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:53,532
And if you have any questions,
please, don't hesitate...

1249
01:14:53,573 --> 01:14:57,244
to ask either one of us.

1250
01:14:57,744 --> 01:14:59,787
How long did it take you to do them?

1251
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:02,331
How long?

1252
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:05,000
I knocked them out all in a week.

1253
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:06,500
I can tell.

1254
01:15:06,542 --> 01:15:09,170
Some of your brush work is rather uneven...

1255
01:15:09,211 --> 01:15:12,298
Well, you get what you pay for.

1256
01:15:12,339 --> 01:15:18,553
It's decent craftsmanship, perhaps a little slick.
Lacks the artist's sole.

1257
01:15:18,594 --> 01:15:22,056
Yeah, but I'm just an amateur.

1258
01:15:24,849 --> 01:15:25,850
It's shameful.

1259
01:15:25,892 --> 01:15:30,021
Cezanne would roll over in his grave,
to see such a mockery of his work.

1260
01:15:30,063 --> 01:15:34,191
Well, let's be glad for both our sakes,
that he won't see it.

1261
01:15:34,232 --> 01:15:37,319
Well, you've heard it from the experts.
You have no talent whatsoever.

1262
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:41,488
Well, I've never been more flattered.

1263
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:43,574
My late husbands desire.

1264
01:15:43,615 --> 01:15:49,745
Was that his masterpieces be owned
by people who will enjoy them.

1265
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:52,956
Not trophy collectors.

1266
01:15:52,998 --> 01:15:55,041
Thus our charade.

1267
01:15:55,082 --> 01:15:59,545
But do you know, in eight years
I have yet to sell a painting.

1268
01:16:00,296 --> 01:16:03,381
Why don't you donate them to an art museum?

1269
01:16:03,423 --> 01:16:06,509
Oh, upon my death, clones of them will be donated.

1270
01:16:06,551 --> 01:16:07,552
Clones?

1271
01:16:07,593 --> 01:16:10,680
Oscar was an art collector, dealer.

1272
01:16:10,721 --> 01:16:18,478
Technical genius... and a practical joker, and
wealthy enough to indulge in his most outrageous whims.

1273
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:25,275
He developed a process where by, he could duplicate
a painting almost on a molecular level.

1274
01:16:25,317 --> 01:16:31,989
He would borrow a grate master from a museum,
and duplicate it, and often send back the copy.

1275
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:34,658
And he was never found out.

1276
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:36,742
A Stary Night... the original.

1277
01:16:36,784 --> 01:16:39,870
The one in New York is a clone.

1278
01:16:39,912 --> 01:16:45,666
This Monet...
the art world thinks that the original is in Paris.

1279
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:48,211
Unbelievable.

1280
01:16:48,252 --> 01:16:50,296
So there're all originals?

1281
01:16:50,338 --> 01:16:53,423
So what one do, with a collection like this?

1282
01:16:53,465 --> 01:16:54,924
You tell everyone they're fakes.

1283
01:16:55,758 --> 01:16:59,679
And so, just before he died, Oscar created this.

1284
01:16:59,721 --> 01:17:01,763
The Museum of Art Fraud.

1285
01:17:01,805 --> 01:17:04,891
The worlds grates art museum.

1286
01:17:04,933 --> 01:17:08,019
Masquerading as a cheap tourist attraction.

1287
01:17:08,061 --> 01:17:10,103
Oh, my God... that's...

1288
01:17:10,145 --> 01:17:14,107
My husband... Oscar Warren James.

1289
01:17:14,316 --> 01:17:17,067
Of course.

1290
01:17:20,571 --> 01:17:22,614
I must say, I was feeling pretty damn good.

1291
01:17:22,656 --> 01:17:24,699
Hell I was feeling inspired.

1292
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:27,827
I wanted to deliver the package,
and then I wanted to go out and paint.

1293
01:17:27,868 --> 01:17:31,997
And I wished I could go back in time,
and enter a piece in Conrad Competition.

1294
01:17:32,039 --> 01:17:35,124
But... I'd had my one wish.

1295
01:17:35,166 --> 01:17:38,669
And I couldn't look back.

1296
01:17:44,132 --> 01:17:47,635
Hot and Cool.
I'm getting warmer, I'm getting colder.

1297
01:17:47,677 --> 01:17:50,429
Of course.

1298
01:17:50,804 --> 01:17:52,848
Eight Ball,

1299
01:17:52,889 --> 01:17:55,976
that girl is not in Danver
and her name is not Robin, isn't it?

1300
01:18:00,187 --> 01:18:03,273
Is she in Morlaw?

1301
01:18:08,527 --> 01:18:11,614
So, if I go there, will I find her?

1302
01:18:16,868 --> 01:18:20,997
So there it was...
The proverbial fork in the road.

1303
01:18:21,038 --> 01:18:25,166
My job. The word I'd given.
The contract I'd signed.

1304
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:28,294
Versus the lovely Lynn.
The girl of my dreams.

1305
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:30,378
Her musical voice in my head, leading me ...

1306
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:32,464
Where?

1307
01:18:32,505 --> 01:18:33,506
So what did I do?

1308
01:18:33,548 --> 01:18:37,677
I did what any self respecting
hopeless romantic would do.

1309
01:18:37,718 --> 01:18:42,014
I rationalized.
Five days to go 158 miles.

1310
01:18:42,931 --> 01:18:46,016
I got time to chase a dream, right Eight Ball?

1311
01:18:50,229 --> 01:18:53,315
Good answer.

1312
01:19:26,717 --> 01:19:29,553
Drivers Licence.

1313
01:19:32,973 --> 01:19:36,058
What did I do, officer?

1314
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:37,101
Nothing.

1315
01:19:37,143 --> 01:19:38,143
You're served.

1316
01:19:38,185 --> 01:19:41,271
You're being sued by Mr. J.J. Madison,
for your responsibility ...

1317
01:19:41,313 --> 01:19:45,441
in a hit and run kill of his pat cat Snickers,
three weeks ago in front of the Courthouse.

1318
01:19:45,483 --> 01:19:48,569
But I've never been here before.
I was in St. Louis three weeks ago.

1319
01:19:48,611 --> 01:19:49,612
Tell it to the judge.

1320
01:19:49,653 --> 01:19:50,905
I'm just process serving.

1321
01:19:50,946 --> 01:19:53,781
Meanwhile I suggest you head to the town
and hire yourself a lawyer...

1322
01:19:53,823 --> 01:19:54,824
You're gonna need one.

1323
01:19:55,408 --> 01:19:57,994
But first...
park your car in that lane over there, by the lake,

1324
01:19:57,994 --> 01:20:00,036
you can get sued for polluting the air.

1325
01:20:24,056 --> 01:20:28,185
Hey Mr., I'm really good, check it out
Stanford, class of 88.

1326
01:20:28,227 --> 01:20:32,230
Suma cum laude, but more important I know the angles.

1327
01:20:35,525 --> 01:20:38,236
You don't need a lawyer.
You need a good lawyer, and that's me.

1328
01:20:38,277 --> 01:20:41,738
Parkinson, and that's the only name you need to remember.
These other guys...

1329
01:20:43,031 --> 01:20:45,909
- I'm uninterested.
- Valerie McCabe. Year of 91.

1330
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:49,703
I've got special rates for visitors.
And I know I can win your case.

1331
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:51,121
You don't even know my case.

1332
01:20:51,163 --> 01:20:54,249
The Madison case?

1333
01:20:54,291 --> 01:20:56,333
Happens to visitors all the time.

1334
01:20:56,375 --> 01:20:58,418
Fact is, J.J Madison doesn't even have a cat.

1335
01:20:58,460 --> 01:20:59,461
He's allergic.

1336
01:20:59,503 --> 01:21:01,546
I can have it thrown out in no time.

1337
01:21:01,588 --> 01:21:03,632
Wait. He never had a cat?

1338
01:21:03,673 --> 01:21:05,716
So why he's gonna sue somebody for it?

1339
01:21:05,758 --> 01:21:07,801
Because he can.

1340
01:21:07,843 --> 01:21:08,844
What?

1341
01:21:08,886 --> 01:21:11,972
Every adult citizen of Morlaw,
is a lawyer.

1342
01:21:12,014 --> 01:21:15,099
So everybody sues everybody else.
It doesn't matter if there is a cause.

1343
01:21:15,141 --> 01:21:17,184
It's how we make sure that
everybody makes a living off the profession.

1344
01:21:17,226 --> 01:21:18,227
Yeah, but that's insane.

1345
01:21:18,269 --> 01:21:19,270
I can sue you for that.

1346
01:21:19,311 --> 01:21:23,439
You just made a defamatory remark
about this town.

1347
01:21:23,481 --> 01:21:25,525
Hey, are you looking at my legs.
I can sue you for that too.

1348
01:21:25,566 --> 01:21:27,610
Sexual harassment.

1349
01:21:27,652 --> 01:21:29,694
Is there anything you can't sue me for?

1350
01:21:29,736 --> 01:21:33,865
Hire me. That way everything between us is
subject to attorney-client privilege.

1351
01:21:33,907 --> 01:21:36,992
I'm $75 an hour. First hour is free.

1352
01:21:37,034 --> 01:21:39,077
Well, at least you know my case.

1353
01:21:39,119 --> 01:21:42,205
All right. You're hired.

1354
01:21:42,247 --> 01:21:44,291
Im suing you Valerie...

1355
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:48,460
For the sexual enticement or the appearance thereof
of the potential client on the public thoroughfare.

1356
01:21:48,502 --> 01:21:51,588
He only hired you,
because he found you sexually attractive.

1357
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:52,631
Hurry. My office.

1358
01:21:52,673 --> 01:21:55,758
We can get lots a dozen more law suits,
just walking down the street.

1359
01:21:57,885 --> 01:22:00,971
This will be essential.
Shouldn't make more then a couple of weeks.

1360
01:22:01,013 --> 01:22:02,013
Weeks?

1361
01:22:02,055 --> 01:22:05,141
No, no, no.
I have to be in Danver on October 2nd.

1362
01:22:05,183 --> 01:22:06,183
It can't take that long.

1363
01:22:06,225 --> 01:22:07,226
That's not long.

1364
01:22:07,268 --> 01:22:09,311
Long is our City limit sign.

1365
01:22:09,353 --> 01:22:12,438
We've been trying to get knew one
put up for five years now.

1366
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:16,609
But we forgot a file an environmental impact report,
and as metal in signpost ...

1367
01:22:16,651 --> 01:22:19,736
is a potentially hazardous substance.
We're in court over that.

1368
01:22:19,778 --> 01:22:22,864
And another lawyer is challenging
the census figure on the sign.

1369
01:22:22,906 --> 01:22:27,034
And another lawyer said we had to do another
land survey to determine the exact city limits,

1370
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:30,162
so we know precisely where to put the sign.
So we brought an Surveyor.

1371
01:22:30,203 --> 01:22:32,247
But he got sued for smoking,

1372
01:22:32,289 --> 01:22:34,331
and wasn't enjoined from finishing the survey.

1373
01:22:34,373 --> 01:22:36,417
I say we're at least two years,
from a new sign.

1374
01:22:36,458 --> 01:22:38,502
And you chose to live here?

1375
01:22:38,544 --> 01:22:40,587
I wouldn't live anywhere else.

1376
01:22:40,629 --> 01:22:42,672
Every day is a new challenge.

1377
01:22:42,713 --> 01:22:43,714
A new precedent.

1378
01:22:43,756 --> 01:22:46,842
A new interpreting of the law.

1379
01:22:46,884 --> 01:22:50,220
It's an intellectual feast.

1380
01:23:01,479 --> 01:23:04,566
So if everyone who lives here is a lawyer,

1381
01:23:04,607 --> 01:23:05,608
How do you live?

1382
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:09,778
I mean, who runs the grocery store...
Who does your dry cleaning...

1383
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:11,863
Who fixes the shitter, when it breaks?

1384
01:23:11,905 --> 01:23:16,033
Well, we all moonlight on a law related jobs.
Police, bailiffs, court reporters...

1385
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:19,161
But those other trivial things,
you mentioned?

1386
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:22,289
They're done by people like you.
Awaiting trial.

1387
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:24,373
It's the only way they can
afford their legal fees.

1388
01:23:24,415 --> 01:23:27,501
Now, I can get you a hearing
on Monday October 1st.

1389
01:23:27,543 --> 01:23:28,544
Meanwhile...

1390
01:23:28,585 --> 01:23:31,671
We'll have to call witnesses,
to testify as your character.

1391
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,713
You know, Family.
Friends.

1392
01:23:32,755 --> 01:23:35,841
So, that you can qualify for your employment
program.  It'll help keep cost down.

1393
01:23:35,883 --> 01:23:41,054
So tomorrow morning, why don't you get me
their names and numbers,and I'll subpena them.

1394
01:23:41,095 --> 01:23:44,182
Well, even if they could get here...
Wouldn't they get sued too?

1395
01:23:44,223 --> 01:23:46,267
Of course.

1396
01:23:46,309 --> 01:23:52,063
But you'll identify them, and their problems
will fall on your shoulders,
which means more work for me.

1397
01:23:53,189 --> 01:23:55,274
I have those phone numbers
They're in my car.

1398
01:23:55,315 --> 01:24:00,153
I'm gonna go get them.
And I'm gonna make few calls, and be right back.

1399
01:24:02,989 --> 01:24:05,032
No you wont.

1400
01:24:05,074 --> 01:24:08,160
Fred... Mr. Oliver is a potential fugitive.

1401
01:24:08,202 --> 01:24:10,245
- Lock him up.
- Lock me up?

1402
01:24:10,287 --> 01:24:11,288
Of course.

1403
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:14,415
We lawyers have to protect out livelihood.

1404
01:24:14,457 --> 01:24:16,500
Hey, you can't do this to me.
I have rights.

1405
01:24:16,542 --> 01:24:21,295
I know you do, sweetie.
I'm here to protect them.

1406
01:24:28,009 --> 01:24:30,053
I couldn't even blame the Eight Ball.

1407
01:24:30,095 --> 01:24:32,138
It said a meeting was possible.

1408
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:33,181
Yeah, right...

1409
01:24:33,223 --> 01:24:36,308
A meteor wiping out Morlaw
was possible too.

1410
01:24:36,349 --> 01:24:41,187
Probably more possible than ever meeting Lynn.

1411
01:24:51,988 --> 01:24:52,988
Lynn!

1412
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:55,491
Over here!

1413
01:25:01,370 --> 01:25:04,332
I'm gonna get you out!

1414
01:25:09,711 --> 01:25:12,672
I'm gonna get you out!

1415
01:25:19,094 --> 01:25:21,137
In order to get her out,
I had to get me out.

1416
01:25:21,179 --> 01:25:25,307
But jailbreak, was clearly not happening.
Ditto for a tunnel job.

1417
01:25:25,349 --> 01:25:27,392
I needed an answer,
and my Eight ball was in the car.

1418
01:25:27,434 --> 01:25:28,435
Damn it.

1419
01:25:28,477 --> 01:25:30,520
There had to be a way,
to blow this thing wide open.

1420
01:25:30,562 --> 01:25:32,606
And then I knew.

1421
01:25:32,647 --> 01:25:34,690
My lawyer needed a character witness.

1422
01:25:34,732 --> 01:25:36,775
I needed a witness

1423
01:25:36,817 --> 01:25:40,195
who was a character.

1424
01:25:43,072 --> 01:25:45,116
Please, state your name and occupation.

1425
01:25:45,157 --> 01:25:48,452
Robert Wilson Cody.

1426
01:25:49,327 --> 01:25:51,370
I'm...
what you might call it an axe grinder.

1427
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:55,541
Mr. Cody...
please, tell the court how you know the defendant.

1428
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:57,625
He was my employee.

1429
01:25:57,667 --> 01:25:59,711
And how would you characterize him?

1430
01:25:59,752 --> 01:26:03,298
Honest. Trustworthy. Intelligent.

1431
01:26:03,339 --> 01:26:05,966
Ask him if he's aware that
the charge against me is a lie,

1432
01:26:06,007 --> 01:26:08,051
and that everyone here knows it.

1433
01:26:08,093 --> 01:26:11,179
It's immaterial.
He can only testify as the character.

1434
01:26:11,221 --> 01:26:12,222
Just ask him.

1435
01:26:12,263 --> 01:26:14,306
The judge will pull it immaterial.

1436
01:26:14,348 --> 01:26:18,185
You ask him... or I'll fire you.

1437
01:26:18,518 --> 01:26:19,978
Mr. Cody...

1438
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:23,314
Are you aware that the charge against Mr. Oliver

1439
01:26:23,355 --> 01:26:28,902
is not only a complete lie, but that the judge,
the plaintiff and every citizen here know it?

1440
01:26:28,944 --> 01:26:33,072
Objection! Immaterial.  It has nothing
to do with the character of the accused.

1441
01:26:33,114 --> 01:26:34,115
Sustained.

1442
01:26:34,156 --> 01:26:37,243
Wait a minute miss...  You'rer saying
that this is a trumped-up charge...

1443
01:26:37,284 --> 01:26:38,284
And you're all in on it?

1444
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:39,327
Immaterial.

1445
01:26:39,369 --> 01:26:41,412
The witness is ordered
to ignore the question.

1446
01:26:41,454 --> 01:26:43,498
Well, I'm not going to ignore it, your honour.

1447
01:26:43,539 --> 01:26:47,667
If, what she says is true,
that's a very serious matter.

1448
01:26:47,709 --> 01:26:50,795
Well, serious or not,
it's immaterial to this hearing.

1449
01:26:50,837 --> 01:26:51,838
Next question.

1450
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:56,008
Oh, judge, I asked her a question...
and I want an answer.

1451
01:26:56,049 --> 01:26:58,760
You don't ask here questions Mr. Cody.
You answer them.

1452
01:26:58,802 --> 01:27:04,223
And if you wont do what I told you to do,
I will hold you in contempt.

1453
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:09,561
Hey, I'm not answering any more questions,
until somebody answers mine.

1454
01:27:09,603 --> 01:27:13,731
Why don't you tell me judge...
are you in on a lie here?

1455
01:27:13,772 --> 01:27:16,859
I fine you 500 dollars for contempt.

1456
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:18,943
Answer my God dam question, judge.

1457
01:27:18,985 --> 01:27:22,071
1000 dollars and 90 days in jail.

1458
01:27:22,113 --> 01:27:23,114
Bailiff, sergeant,

1459
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:26,283
Put Mr. Cody in a cell.

1460
01:27:27,325 --> 01:27:30,411
Hold the go, boys.

1461
01:27:30,453 --> 01:27:31,454
This is dynamite.

1462
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:35,624
We'll all go with a bang,
if anyone takes another step towards me...

1463
01:27:35,665 --> 01:27:37,125
Gentlemen, just drop your guns.

1464
01:27:37,167 --> 01:27:38,752
Everyone else, stay seeted.

1465
01:27:38,793 --> 01:27:41,880
Judge...
stick your finger up your nose.

1466
01:27:41,921 --> 01:27:43,964
I'm not kidding.

1467
01:27:44,006 --> 01:27:50,220
I'm terminally ill and I'll gladly take you
all with me to hell right now.

1468
01:27:50,262 --> 01:27:53,347
Judge! I said, stick your finger up your nose.

1469
01:27:53,389 --> 01:27:55,432
You'd better do it judge.
I know this buy...

1470
01:27:55,474 --> 01:27:59,394
He says what he means;
he means that he says.

1471
01:28:03,814 --> 01:28:06,901
I'm glad we understand,
who's in charge now.

1472
01:28:06,942 --> 01:28:08,985
So judge..

1473
01:28:09,027 --> 01:28:11,070
This whole deal was a lie.

1474
01:28:11,112 --> 01:28:12,113
Is that right?

1475
01:28:12,155 --> 01:28:15,116
Keep that finger in your nose.

1476
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:18,368
Yes.

1477
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:20,453
Yes, sir.

1478
01:28:20,495 --> 01:28:23,122
Yes... sir.

1479
01:28:25,707 --> 01:28:27,751
All right.

1480
01:28:27,792 --> 01:28:28,793
Show our hands...

1481
01:28:28,835 --> 01:28:34,548
How many here knew that it was a
railroad job against Mr. Oliver?

1482
01:28:41,345 --> 01:28:44,431
Liers... Lawyers.

1483
01:28:44,473 --> 01:28:45,474
Mr. Oliver...

1484
01:28:45,516 --> 01:28:49,685
How do we teach these...
liars a lesson?

1485
01:28:53,856 --> 01:28:55,900
Now, read it judge.

1486
01:28:55,941 --> 01:28:57,400
By this order,

1487
01:28:57,442 --> 01:29:00,611
all legal actions, charges, fines and fees,

1488
01:29:00,653 --> 01:29:03,197
against any non citizen of Morlaw,

1489
01:29:03,239 --> 01:29:05,282
in any matter pending before any Morlaw court,

1490
01:29:05,323 --> 01:29:09,911
I here by dismissed,
and I declare an unconditional amnesty.

1491
01:29:09,953 --> 01:29:11,538
Thank you.
Bailiff.

1492
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:14,665
Make a few hundred copies of that,
and post it all over town.

1493
01:29:14,706 --> 01:29:20,128
You know this is an interesting town...
I think I might just stay here.

1494
01:29:20,961 --> 01:29:24,798
Any problem with that judge?

1495
01:29:25,132 --> 01:29:28,343
No... no problem.
Sir.

1496
01:30:23,514 --> 01:30:25,558
Lynn?

1497
01:30:25,599 --> 01:30:28,977
Hi... I'm Neal.

1498
01:30:29,769 --> 01:30:31,813
I'm the guy who got you out.

1499
01:30:31,854 --> 01:30:34,940
Yo, please to fuckin meet you, Neal.

1500
01:30:34,981 --> 01:30:37,692
Man, I've been so fucked up in here,
for so long,

1501
01:30:37,734 --> 01:30:41,196
I thought,
I was never getting the fuck out.

1502
01:30:41,237 --> 01:30:46,241
Yo bitch!  I want back my fuckin cloths,
you cocksucker's confiscated.

1503
01:30:46,450 --> 01:30:51,662
I shouldnt be fuckin wearin this,
I'm on leash no more.

1504
01:30:52,704 --> 01:30:53,705
Hey, handsome...

1505
01:30:53,747 --> 01:30:56,833
What you looking at me like that for?

1506
01:30:56,875 --> 01:30:59,960
I just didn't expect you to talk that way.

1507
01:31:00,002 --> 01:31:02,046
What, something wrong
with the way I fuckin talk?

1508
01:31:02,087 --> 01:31:05,174
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1509
01:31:08,342 --> 01:31:10,386
I mean, YES.

1510
01:31:10,428 --> 01:31:11,429
Yes.

1511
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:14,557
You make Mike Tyson sound
like an Oxford graduate.

1512
01:31:14,598 --> 01:31:16,641
What do you like fuckin dissin' me?

1513
01:31:16,683 --> 01:31:19,769
You like saying that I never went
to fuckin school, something?

1514
01:31:19,811 --> 01:31:22,897
Yes... that's exactly what I'm saying...

1515
01:31:22,938 --> 01:31:23,939
Don't worry.

1516
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:26,816
It's just an act.

1517
01:31:31,278 --> 01:31:34,239
Well, it sort of a test, see.

1518
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:37,492
Guys are always so eager to score points on me
they would be like: Oh, no...

1519
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:40,035
Lynn, no, the way you talk is charming.

1520
01:31:40,077 --> 01:31:43,747
Unique, refreshing, a breath of fresh air, yeah.

1521
01:31:43,789 --> 01:31:46,083
Air from the sewer, is more like it.

1522
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:51,045
Me, I would...
never go out with somebody who talked like that.

1523
01:31:51,087 --> 01:31:54,173
I'm glad you wouldn't either.

1524
01:31:54,215 --> 01:31:58,342
I hope you have a car.
I had to sell mine to pay my legal fees.

1525
01:31:58,384 --> 01:32:01,262
I have a car.

1526
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:07,725
So, how many guys did told you
that you sound cheap?

1527
01:32:07,767 --> 01:32:08,768
You're the first.

1528
01:32:08,810 --> 01:32:10,853
You know,
you're better looking than I've expected.

1529
01:32:10,895 --> 01:32:13,438
Ditto.

1530
01:32:14,022 --> 01:32:15,690
Wait a minute... you've been expecting me?

1531
01:32:15,732 --> 01:32:17,108
Of course...

1532
01:32:17,150 --> 01:32:22,321
That's how the stories always go...
the handsome prince rescues princess from the dungeon.

1533
01:32:22,362 --> 01:32:25,449
That was the point of the messages.

1534
01:32:25,490 --> 01:32:26,491
The messages?

1535
01:32:26,533 --> 01:32:27,534
Billboards.

1536
01:32:27,576 --> 01:32:30,661
My last name is Linden, by the way.

1537
01:32:30,703 --> 01:32:33,789
See, I knew somebody would figure out eventually.

1538
01:32:33,831 --> 01:32:35,874
At least that's what he told me.

1539
01:32:35,916 --> 01:32:36,916
Who?

1540
01:32:36,958 --> 01:32:39,001
O.W. Grant.

1541
01:32:39,043 --> 01:32:41,087
See, I made a wish to meet the right guy.

1542
01:32:41,128 --> 01:32:46,090
Although if I'd have known that I'd spend
a year in jail waiting. Maybe I wouldn't have.

1543
01:32:47,383 --> 01:32:53,597
The prince has to undergo tests and challenges,
so that the princes will be convinced that he's worthy.

1544
01:32:53,638 --> 01:32:56,725
And you passed mine.
So what's yours?

1545
01:32:56,766 --> 01:32:58,226
What? My test?

1546
01:32:58,268 --> 01:33:00,520
Come on. Everybody has the sympatica test.

1547
01:33:00,603 --> 01:33:03,647
Do you cut your grapefruit in half
or peal it?

1548
01:33:03,689 --> 01:33:05,065
My? I peal it.

1549
01:33:05,107 --> 01:33:08,527
Favourite cartoon character?
Spider-man.

1550
01:33:08,568 --> 01:33:11,320
Thin or thick cross pizza?
I go for thin every time.

1551
01:33:11,362 --> 01:33:13,405
We're three to three.

1552
01:33:13,447 --> 01:33:16,533
I can't bel...
OK, Close encounters?

1553
01:33:16,575 --> 01:33:20,536
I would get on ship, no question.

1554
01:33:20,745 --> 01:33:23,581
What's wrong?

1555
01:33:23,873 --> 01:33:25,915
This is just... it's all to perfect.

1556
01:33:25,957 --> 01:33:28,000
I mean, you know...
You are.

1557
01:33:28,042 --> 01:33:31,128
You know, when something seems
too good to be true?

1558
01:33:31,170 --> 01:33:34,130
Hold that thought.

1559
01:33:37,425 --> 01:33:39,469
You see?
I'm not that perfect.

1560
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:42,596
Right. Right.
I feel much better now.

1561
01:33:42,637 --> 01:33:45,265
Ditto.

1562
01:34:04,948 --> 01:34:07,617
So, you actually wished for mister-right?

1563
01:34:07,658 --> 01:34:10,745
What can I say? I'm human.
Humans have certain needs.

1564
01:34:10,786 --> 01:34:12,830
Like companionship.

1565
01:34:12,872 --> 01:34:15,957
And you.
Did you wish for me?

1566
01:34:15,999 --> 01:34:19,085
Well, actually I wished for this.

1567
01:34:19,127 --> 01:34:20,128
Gives my answers.

1568
01:34:20,169 --> 01:34:22,212
But are they the right answers?

1569
01:34:22,254 --> 01:34:25,131
So far.

1570
01:34:47,274 --> 01:34:50,361
This were your billboards.

1571
01:34:50,402 --> 01:34:54,739
Obviously, I don't need them any more.

1572
01:34:56,657 --> 01:34:59,744
Maybe it's time for the... you know...

1573
01:34:59,785 --> 01:35:01,829
Happily ever after part.

1574
01:35:01,871 --> 01:35:03,705
Not quite.

1575
01:35:03,746 --> 01:35:07,041
I still have a job to finish.
Tomorrow October 2nd Danver.

1576
01:35:07,083 --> 01:35:08,084
Danver.

1577
01:35:08,126 --> 01:35:10,169
What's wrong?

1578
01:35:10,211 --> 01:35:18,676
Grant gave me an envelope.
He said if anyone was ever went to Danver I should open it.

1579
01:35:24,806 --> 01:35:28,934
I don't know
if these message if for me or you.

1580
01:35:28,976 --> 01:35:32,062
Neal... don't go.

1581
01:35:32,104 --> 01:35:36,565
I gave my word, to this guy
that I deliver this package. I have to.

1582
01:35:39,402 --> 01:35:43,988
Eight Ball, should I go to Danver?

1583
01:36:21,103 --> 01:36:23,147
Are you serious?

1584
01:36:23,188 --> 01:36:25,231
I'm serious.

1585
01:36:25,273 --> 01:36:27,316
You mean, you didn't sleep at all?

1586
01:36:27,358 --> 01:36:29,402
No, I couldn't.

1587
01:36:29,443 --> 01:36:32,529
I was possessed,
by the views.

1588
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:34,614
I love it.

1589
01:36:34,656 --> 01:36:36,699
- You're not just saying that?
- No.

1590
01:36:36,741 --> 01:36:40,077
It's got soul... passion...

1591
01:36:44,039 --> 01:36:47,459
Take me with you.

1592
01:36:48,209 --> 01:36:53,338
- What about the letter?
- Screw it. I want to go with you.

1593
01:36:57,591 --> 01:37:02,763
Eight Ball,
should I take Lynn with me to Danver?

1594
01:37:02,805 --> 01:37:05,556
Bad idea.

1595
01:37:06,974 --> 01:37:09,018
Is that, because it's dangerous?

1596
01:37:12,187 --> 01:37:15,273
The killer, does it have to do with the killer?

1597
01:37:16,774 --> 01:37:20,486
I don't care if it's dangerous, or what this thing says.
I still want to go with you.

1598
01:37:20,528 --> 01:37:22,570
No, Lynn.

1599
01:37:22,612 --> 01:37:24,656
It would get me crazy...

1600
01:37:24,697 --> 01:37:27,784
I'm not  gonna risk losing you,
not after I just found you.

1601
01:37:27,825 --> 01:37:30,911
What if I lose you?

1602
01:37:30,952 --> 01:37:31,953
Lynn you can't go.

1603
01:37:31,995 --> 01:37:36,124
The Ball is never wrong.
I'll come back, I promise.

1604
01:37:37,208 --> 01:37:40,294
Eight Ball, I will come back for her, won't I?

1605
01:37:40,335 --> 01:37:41,336
Yes.

1606
01:37:41,378 --> 01:37:44,464
You will come back for me.

1607
01:38:05,356 --> 01:38:07,400
Am I nuts?

1608
01:38:07,442 --> 01:38:12,654
The girl of my dreams,
and I leave her behind, because of this stupid toy.

1609
01:38:33,505 --> 01:38:36,590
- What's up, officer?
- Just got word, there's a killer in the area.

1610
01:38:36,632 --> 01:38:39,718
Orders are to close the road.

1611
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:41,220
What's this killer look like?

1612
01:38:41,262 --> 01:38:42,845
It's coming over the radio now.

1613
01:38:42,887 --> 01:38:48,059
<i>The murder suspect is white, male,
last seen driving a red BMW convertible,</i>

1614
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:50,144
<i>along Interstate 60.</i>

1615
01:38:50,186 --> 01:38:55,231
<i>This vehicle has a white pains, splattered on the trunk lid.</i>

1616
01:39:03,738 --> 01:39:08,825
You best turn around son.
It's not safe for you here.

1617
01:39:18,959 --> 01:39:21,462
It was ten miles before my
heart rate was back in a double digits,

1618
01:39:21,503 --> 01:39:24,547
and I can think straight.
Then I realised...

1619
01:39:24,589 --> 01:39:27,675
Eigtht Ball, is Lynn in danger from this killer?

1620
01:39:46,482 --> 01:39:51,695
<i>Cellular service,
is not available in this area.</i>

1621
01:40:01,078 --> 01:40:05,122
Beamers suck. Jeep rule!

1622
01:40:12,545 --> 01:40:16,090
Oh, shit...
Oh shit...

1623
01:40:21,928 --> 01:40:23,972
Damn punks, and their paint again!

1624
01:40:24,013 --> 01:40:26,516
Calling the sheriff.
Here watch where they go.

1625
01:40:26,557 --> 01:40:32,771
- No, no, no. Please don't call the sheriff
- The hell I wont.
I'm sick of those punks making trouble around here.

1626
01:40:43,822 --> 01:40:46,782
Hey, come back with my binoculars!

1627
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:53,162
Eight Ball, am I the killer?

1628
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:05,298
<i>Latest reports, indicate the suspect is carrying a
murder weapon in a square box, wrapped in brown paper.</i>

1629
01:41:05,339 --> 01:41:08,801
<i>Once again, suspect is carrying a
murder weapon in a square package in a ...</i>

1630
01:41:08,843 --> 01:41:09,843
Oh no.

1631
01:41:09,884 --> 01:41:12,470
Shit!

1632
01:41:13,012 --> 01:41:16,099
Eight Ball, is the murder weapon in this box?

1633
01:41:20,310 --> 01:41:22,354
Should I open it?

1634
01:41:30,736 --> 01:41:31,987
Shit.

1635
01:41:32,029 --> 01:41:35,322
If it is a murder weapon,
I'm gonna get my finger prints all over it.

1636
01:41:35,364 --> 01:41:38,242
Eight Ball, I really need an answer right now.
What should I do?

1637
01:41:40,119 --> 01:41:42,161
Damn you!

1638
01:41:42,203 --> 01:41:43,204
Yes or No questions.

1639
01:41:43,246 --> 01:41:46,332
Come on Neal. Think. Be logical...

1640
01:41:46,374 --> 01:41:47,833
He called the cops...

1641
01:41:47,875 --> 01:41:53,796
So, which ever way they're going,
I've got to go the opposite way.

1642
01:42:03,054 --> 01:42:06,139
Well, it's got to be one way or the other.

1643
01:42:06,181 --> 01:42:10,769
Right Eight Ball? I mean, I got two choices here,
so it's got to be one or the other. Right?

1644
01:42:12,437 --> 01:42:13,563
Take it to the Bank.

1645
01:42:16,607 --> 01:42:18,650
Sorry dad.

1646
01:42:18,692 --> 01:42:21,778
No, there is another choice.

1647
01:42:28,075 --> 01:42:33,162
<i>Sheriffs and police in two counties
have closed up Interstate 60 in both directions</i>

1648
01:42:33,204 --> 01:42:39,042
<i> with the attend of boxing in the suspect,
who was last seen driving red BMW convertible,</i>

1649
01:42:39,084 --> 01:42:43,296
<i>with white paint splattered on the trunks lid.</i>

1650
01:42:51,011 --> 01:42:54,597
I knew this wasn't my kind of car.

1651
01:44:15,873 --> 01:44:17,499
What were the chances?

1652
01:44:17,541 --> 01:44:21,670
What were the chances,
that the killer would be in a car, just like mine,

1653
01:44:21,711 --> 01:44:24,796
and I get white paint on mine,
just like his?

1654
01:44:24,838 --> 01:44:26,882
Now Grant would say, it was inevitable.

1655
01:44:26,924 --> 01:44:30,677
That at least once in a infinite universe,
events would happen that way,

1656
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:33,137
and this was that time.

1657
01:44:33,178 --> 01:44:36,265
But Grant also said, on this highway,
the past and the future,

1658
01:44:36,306 --> 01:44:39,393
and what ifs and maybes
can all get jumbled up.

1659
01:44:39,434 --> 01:44:43,187
So, I had to see for myself.

1660
01:44:54,030 --> 01:44:56,073
Hey! Get away from there!

1661
01:44:56,115 --> 01:44:58,158
Who was he?

1662
01:44:58,199 --> 01:45:01,286
They say he was some law student
from St. Louis.

1663
01:45:01,327 --> 01:45:05,539
Went nuts, and killed his old man.

1664
01:45:10,710 --> 01:45:14,129
I love this highway.

1665
01:45:21,552 --> 01:45:23,846
Eight Ball, I've got a lot of questions.

1666
01:45:23,888 --> 01:45:26,932
Was that guy in the car...

1667
01:45:27,391 --> 01:45:30,101
What the hell I'm asking you for?

1668
01:46:18,474 --> 01:46:21,394
Robin Fields?

1669
01:46:22,645 --> 01:46:25,564
Is anybody here?

1670
01:46:25,773 --> 01:46:28,691
I'm here.

1671
01:46:30,985 --> 01:46:33,321
Ray?

1672
01:46:36,198 --> 01:46:38,241
- Delivery is for you.
- No, no, no.

1673
01:46:38,283 --> 01:46:41,369
I wouldn't hire you,
to deliver package to myself.

1674
01:46:41,411 --> 01:46:44,496
It's for my cousin.

1675
01:46:44,538 --> 01:46:47,165
Here he is now.

1676
01:46:52,878 --> 01:46:53,879
Robin Fields.

1677
01:46:53,921 --> 01:46:57,007
One of my many synonyms.

1678
01:46:57,049 --> 01:46:59,675
Cousins?

1679
01:47:00,176 --> 01:47:03,262
You set in my car, with your own package.

1680
01:47:03,304 --> 01:47:06,432
- Why didn't you take it?
- Well, you made a deal.

1681
01:47:06,432 --> 01:47:10,560
What kind of guy would I be if I caused you to...
violate your blood oath?

1682
01:47:10,601 --> 01:47:13,688
And, besides,
it's the fact that you lost all your money...

1683
01:47:13,729 --> 01:47:15,772
and you went to jail...
you left to girl...

1684
01:47:15,814 --> 01:47:16,815
ditched your car...

1685
01:47:16,856 --> 01:47:17,857
All, to bring this to me?

1686
01:47:17,899 --> 01:47:19,943
Makes it far more valuable.

1687
01:47:19,984 --> 01:47:23,946
Now it has... stories to go with it.

1688
01:47:27,074 --> 01:47:31,411
Well ...
Don't you want to know what's inside?

1689
01:47:31,453 --> 01:47:33,495
I did before, but...

1690
01:47:33,537 --> 01:47:36,623
doesn't really matter now... 'cause,

1691
01:47:36,665 --> 01:47:40,793
whatever it is...
won't be as good as the stories.

1692
01:47:40,835 --> 01:47:43,921
Well seing as you understand that.

1693
01:47:43,963 --> 01:47:46,715
I'll open it.

1694
01:48:07,941 --> 01:48:09,984
You're not gonna light it?

1695
01:48:10,026 --> 01:48:13,153
I don't need to.

1696
01:49:06,323 --> 01:49:08,367
So, how's that new car?

1697
01:49:08,408 --> 01:49:09,408
Awesome?

1698
01:49:09,450 --> 01:49:11,494
Dad...

1699
01:49:11,535 --> 01:49:14,622
What's my favourite color?

1700
01:49:14,663 --> 01:49:15,664
Blue.

1701
01:49:15,706 --> 01:49:19,876
Why would you buy me a red Beamer?

1702
01:49:20,710 --> 01:49:23,212
Red's a great colour.
Specially for a convertible.

1703
01:49:23,254 --> 01:49:27,131
You know, my BMW's suppose been a great source
of joy to me, so I just thought...

1704
01:49:27,173 --> 01:49:28,174
Happy birthday dad.

1705
01:49:28,216 --> 01:49:30,259
In the future,
if you want to buy me a gift...

1706
01:49:30,301 --> 01:49:34,429
Buy me something I want.
Not something you want.

1707
01:49:34,471 --> 01:49:37,557
Son... it's a gift...

1708
01:49:37,599 --> 01:49:42,769
And if you don't accept it...
I will take it as a personal insult.

1709
01:49:42,811 --> 01:49:44,855
Well, in that case we're even.

1710
01:49:44,896 --> 01:49:49,025
Because I consider the gift itself,
to me and to who I am.

1711
01:49:49,067 --> 01:49:54,655
How would you like it, if I bought you
an easel and a paint box for your birthday?

1712
01:49:56,365 --> 01:49:59,450
I never thought of it that way.

1713
01:49:59,492 --> 01:50:02,578
Perhaps I could've given it a little more thought.

1714
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:03,621
Thank you dad.

1715
01:50:03,662 --> 01:50:05,706
Apology accepted.

1716
01:50:05,748 --> 01:50:07,790
Now the Bradford thing.
I'm not going there.

1717
01:50:07,832 --> 01:50:09,876
- 'Cause I'm not going to law school...
- But son?

1718
01:50:09,917 --> 01:50:10,918
No buts, Dad.

1719
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:13,004
This is your life, you made it, it works for you.

1720
01:50:13,045 --> 01:50:16,172
I've got to find something that works for me.
I'm sorry if you don't approve,

1721
01:50:16,214 --> 01:50:18,216
but you can take that to the bank.

1722
01:50:18,258 --> 01:50:19,259
Well, I don't approve.

1723
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:21,344
And it's time you face the truth
about your art.

1724
01:50:21,386 --> 01:50:23,428
It's mediocre, look...

1725
01:50:23,470 --> 01:50:25,514
Neal... great news.

1726
01:50:25,555 --> 01:50:27,599
That piece,
you entered in the Conrad Competition...

1727
01:50:27,641 --> 01:50:30,727
There's a very interested buyer,
who wants to talk to you about it right now.

1728
01:50:30,768 --> 01:50:34,021
Come on. I'll take you.

1729
01:50:34,938 --> 01:50:36,982
No dad... that thing...

1730
01:50:37,024 --> 01:50:38,025
It's crap.

1731
01:50:38,066 --> 01:50:40,985
You got ripped off.

1732
01:50:42,236 --> 01:50:45,697
And it's upside down.

1733
01:50:48,491 --> 01:50:54,205
I must be feeling Alzheimers.  I don't remember
entering anything into Conrad Competition.

1734
01:51:12,469 --> 01:51:14,513
You left it in motel.

1735
01:51:14,554 --> 01:51:19,600
I took the liberty of entering it for you.

1736
01:51:19,767 --> 01:51:20,768
Thank you, Mr...

1737
01:51:20,809 --> 01:51:24,938
Conrad...
Oh, you're welcome mister Oliver...

1738
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:27,024
You're Neal Oliver...

1739
01:51:27,065 --> 01:51:30,276
I just love your painting.

1740
01:51:35,406 --> 01:51:38,991
Excuse my, I'm sorry...
I've just got this...

1741
01:51:39,575 --> 01:51:42,662
Major dj vu about you.

1742
01:51:42,703 --> 01:51:44,746
No, no, no.
It's OK, I did too.

1743
01:51:44,788 --> 01:51:47,707
Big time.

1744
01:51:48,958 --> 01:51:49,959
I just love this...

1745
01:51:50,001 --> 01:51:53,336
It's got soul... passion...

1746
01:51:55,213 --> 01:51:58,049
- I'm...
- Lynn Linden.

1747
01:51:58,341 --> 01:52:01,051
Yeah, I know.

1748
01:52:04,596 --> 01:52:10,351
I'm with Danver publishing, we do..
prints, posters, and art books.

1749
01:52:10,851 --> 01:52:16,023
Well, it's maybe a little presumptuous of me, but
would you consider doing a serious of motels, cafes,

1750
01:52:16,064 --> 01:52:20,192
gas stations... all in this style?

1751
01:52:20,234 --> 01:52:23,904
It's exactly what I was thinking.

1752
01:52:25,446 --> 01:52:28,533
- My brother is really talented.
- Oh, he's gonna be fine.

1753
01:52:28,574 --> 01:52:29,575
Just fine.

1754
01:52:29,617 --> 01:52:31,661
He's got a great future ahead of him.

1755
01:52:31,702 --> 01:52:33,787
They both do.

1756
01:52:33,828 --> 01:52:36,873
Say...
you have a birthday coming up, don't you?

1757
01:52:36,915 --> 01:52:38,958
Well, how do you know that?

1758
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:43,128
Don't forget to make the wish.
