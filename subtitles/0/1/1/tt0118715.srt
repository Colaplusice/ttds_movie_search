See them tumbling down

2
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:39,873
Pledging their love
to the ground

3
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:42,576
NARRATOR: Way out West
there was this fella.

4
00:00:42,577 --> 00:00:45,012
Fella I wanna tell you about.

5
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:48,548
Fella by the name
of Jeff Lebowski.

6
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:52,252
east that was the handle
that his loving parents
gave him.

7
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:55,389
But he never had
much use for it himself.

8
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,526
This Lebowski,
he called himself the Dude.

9
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:01,662
Now Dude,

10
00:01:01,663 --> 00:01:05,432
that's a name no one would
self-apply where I come from.

11
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:10,904
But then there was a lot about
the Dude that didn't make
a whole lot of sense to me,

12
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:13,640
and a lot about
where he lived likewise.

13
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:15,909
Drifting along with
the tumbling tumbleweeds

14
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,578
NARRATOR: But then again,

15
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:20,747
maybe that's why
I found the place
so darned interesting.

16
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,783
I know when night has gone

17
00:01:22,784 --> 00:01:25,752
That a new world's
born at dawn

18
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:29,856
NARRATOR:
They call Los Angeles
the City of Angels.

19
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:32,993
I didn't find it to be that,
exactly.

20
00:01:32,994 --> 00:01:36,797
But I'll allow there are
some nice folks there.

21
00:01:36,798 --> 00:01:39,566
Course, I can't say
I seen London,

22
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,902
and I never been to France,

23
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:47,007
and I ain't never seen no
queen in her damned undies,
as the fella says.

24
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,009
But I'll tell you what,

25
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:54,381
after seeing Los Angeles
and this here story
I'm about to unfold,

26
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:57,317
well, I guess
I've seen something

27
00:01:57,318 --> 00:02:01,588
every bit as stupefying
as you can see in any of
those other places,

28
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:03,824
and in English, too.

29
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:06,827
So I can die with
a smile on my face

30
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:09,627
without feeling like
the good Lord gypped me.

31
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,733
Now, this here story
I'm about to unfold

32
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:15,836
took place back
in the early '9s,

33
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:20,774
just about the time
of our conflict with
Saddam and the lraqis.

34
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:24,444
I only mention it 'cause
sometimes there's a man...

35
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,546
I won't say a hero.

36
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:28,682
'Cause what's a hero?

37
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:31,084
But sometimes there's a man...

38
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:34,187
And I'm talking about
the Dude here.

39
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:36,957
Sometimes there's a man...

40
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:41,628
Well, he's the man
for his time and place.

41
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:44,431
He fits right in there.

42
00:02:44,432 --> 00:02:47,834
And that's the Dude
in Los Angeles.

43
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,638
And even if he is a lazy man,

44
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:54,341
and the Dude was
most certainly that,

45
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:58,178
quite possibly the laziest
in Los Angeles county,

46
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:02,047
which would place him
high in the running
for laziest worldwide.

47
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:06,186
But sometimes there's a man...

48
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,986
Sometimes there's a man...

49
00:03:10,425 --> 00:03:13,927
Well, I lost my train
of thought here.

50
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,191
But...

51
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,598
Hell, I done introduced him
enough.

is not the preferred
nomenclature.

161
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,231
Asian-American,
please.

162
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:54,734
Walter, this isn't a guy
who built the railroads
here. This is a guy...

163
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,503
What the fuck
are you...

164
00:08:56,504 --> 00:08:59,572
Walter, he peed
on my rug!
He peed on
the Dude's rug.

165
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:01,207
Donny, you're out
of your element.

166
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:04,577
Dude, the Chinaman
is not the issue here.

167
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:07,080
So, who...
Jeff Lebowski.

168
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:10,283
The other Jeffrey Lebowski.
The millionaire.

169
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:13,119
That's fucking
interesting, man.
That's fucking interesting.

170
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,190
Plus, he has the
wealth, obviously,
and the resources,

171
00:09:17,191 --> 00:09:19,793
so that there's no reason,
there's no fucking reason

172
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:22,595
why his wife should
go out and owe money
all over town,

173
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:25,131
and then they come
and they pee on your
fucking rug!

174
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:26,466
Am I wrong?
No.

175
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:28,101
Am I wrong?
Yeah, but...

176
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:29,235
WALTER: Okay then.

177
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,727
(WALTER CLEARS THROAT)

178
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:34,074
That rug really tied
the room together,
did it not?

179
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,075
Fucking A.
And this guy peed on it.

180
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,477
Donny, please.

181
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:38,745
You know, this is
the fucking guy...

182
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:41,114
I could find this
fucking Lebowski guy.

183
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:43,550
His name is Lebowski?
That's your name, Dude.

184
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:47,921
This is the guy who
should compensate me
for the fucking rug.

185
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:51,624
His wife goes out and
owes money all over town,
and they pee on my rug?

186
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,760
They pee on
your fucking rug?

187
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:56,457
Peed on my fucking rug.
That's right, Dude.

188
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,231
They peed on
your fucking rug.

189
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:03,603
This is the study.

190
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:06,306
As you can see, the various
commendations, awards...

191
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:10,276
"Jeffrey Lebowski."
...citations, honorary
degrees, et cetera.

192
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:14,013
Very impressive.
Oh, please feel free
to inspect them.

193
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:16,716
Oh. No, I'm not really...
Oh, please. Please.

194
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,751
That is the key to
the city of Pasadena,

195
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:24,190
which Mr. Lebowski received
two years ago in recognition
of his various civic...

196
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:28,962
Oh! That's the Los Angeles
Chamber of Commerce
Business Achiever Award,

197
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:31,197
which is given...
Oh, not necessarily
given every year.

198
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:32,398
Hey, is this...

199
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,700
Given only when there's
a worthy somebody...

200
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:35,068
Is this him with Nancy?

201
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:38,404
Yes, indeed,
that is Mr. Lebowski
with the first lady, yes.

202
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:39,706
It was taken
when Mrs. Reagan...

203
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:42,442
That's Lebowski
on the left there?

204
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:45,245
Of course. Mr. Lebowski,
on the left...
So he's a...

205
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:47,914
You know, a handicapped
kind of guy?

206
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:50,077
Mr. Lebowski is
disabled, yes.

207
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:54,020
This picture was taken
when Mrs. Reagan was
first lady of the nation.

208
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,188
Yes, yes.

209
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:57,223
Not of California.
Good shot.

210
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:59,526
In fact, he met privately
with the President,

211
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:02,362
though, unfortunately,
there wasn't enough time
for a photo opportunity.

212
00:11:02,363 --> 00:11:04,397
Oh, Nancy's pretty good.
Oh, wonderful woman.

213
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:06,766
We were very happy to...
These are...

214
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,536
Oh, those are
Mr. Lebowski's
children, so to speak.

215
00:11:09,537 --> 00:11:10,904
Different mothers, huh?

216
00:11:10,905 --> 00:11:13,306
No, they're not...
Racially, he's
pretty cool?

217
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:14,706
(LAUGHING)

218
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:16,843
They're not literally
his children.

219
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,179
They're the Little Lebowski
Urban Achievers,

220
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,282
inner city children
of promise, but without
the necessary means for...

221
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:24,384
Necessary means for
a higher education,

222
00:11:24,385 --> 00:11:27,887
so Mr. Lebowski is
committed to sending
all of them to college.

223
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,289
Excuse me.
Oh, geez.

224
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,191
Thank you. Thank you.

225
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:35,652
Far out. Think he's got
room for one more?
One... Oh.

226
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:38,631
You never went to college.

227
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:40,767
Please, don't touch that.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, I did,

228
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:43,136
but, you know,
I spent most of my time

229
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:46,372
occupying various
administration buildings,

230
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,241
smoking a lot
of Thai stick,

231
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:51,511
(LAUGHING)
breaking into the ROTC
and bowling.

232
00:11:51,512 --> 00:11:53,742
Tell you the truth, Brandt,
I don't remember most of it.

233
00:11:56,584 --> 00:11:57,750
(SCOFFS)

234
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:58,912
(DOOR OPENS)

235
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,789
Okay, sir.
You're a Lebowski,
I'm a Lebowski.

236
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,624
That's terrific.

237
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,492
But I am very busy,
as I imagine you are.

238
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:10,363
What can I do for you, sir?

239
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:13,967
Well, sir,
it's this rug I have.

240
00:12:13,968 --> 00:12:16,069
It really tied
the room together.

241
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,838
You told Brandt
on the phone.
He told me.

242
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,364
Where do I fit in?

243
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:24,344
Well, they were looking
for you, these two guys.

244
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:26,412
You know, they...
I'll say it again.

245
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:29,616
You told Brandt on the phone.
He told me.

246
00:12:29,617 --> 00:12:31,751
I know what happened.
Yes, yes.

247
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:35,054
Oh, so you know that
they were trying to
piss on your rug.

248
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,323
Did I urinate on your rug?

249
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,659
You mean, did you personally
come and pee on my rug?

250
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,728
Hello! Do you speak
English, sir?

%Parla usted ingls?

252
00:12:43,664 --> 00:12:46,531
I'll ask you again.
Did I urinate on your rug?

253
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:50,036
No. Like I said,
Woo peed on my rug.

254
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,804
I just want to
understand this, sir.

255
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:55,808
Every time a rug
is micturated upon
in this fair city,

256
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,644
I have to compensate
the person?

257
00:12:57,645 --> 00:13:00,947
Come on, man.
I'm not trying to
scam anybody here.

258
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,849
You know, I'm just...

259
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,377
You're just looking for
a handout like every other...

260
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:10,020
Are you employed,
Mr. Lebowski?

261
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:13,526
Wait. Let me explain
something to you.

262
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,461
I am not Mr. Lebowski.

263
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,498
You're Mr. Lebowski.
I'm the Dude.

264
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:21,100
So that's what you call me.
You know?

265
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:23,236
That or His Dudeness,

266
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:25,805
or Duder or, you know,

El Duderino, if you're not
into the whole brevity thing.

268
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,900
Are you employed, sir?

269
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,680
Employed?

270
00:13:33,681 --> 00:13:34,781
(CHUCKLES)

271
00:13:34,782 --> 00:13:39,585
You don't go out looking for
a job dressed like that,
do you? On a weekday?

272
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,054
Is this a...

273
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:44,290
What day is this?
Well, I do work, sir.

274
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:48,528
So, if you don't mind...
No, I do mind.
The Dude minds.

275
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:50,363
This will not stand, you know.

276
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:52,965
This aggression
will not stand, man.

277
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,801
I mean,
your wife owes money...

278
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:57,837
My wife is not
the issue here!

279
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,307
I hope that someday
my wife will learn to
live on her allowance,

280
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,775
which is ample.

281
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:05,712
But if she does not,
that is her problem,
not mine,

282
00:14:05,713 --> 00:14:07,413
just as the rug
is your problem.

283
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:11,451
Just as every bum's
lot in life is his
own responsibility,

284
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:14,253
regardless of who
he chooses to blame.

285
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:17,423
I didn't blame anyone
for the loss of my legs.

286
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,959
Some Chinaman took them
from me in Korea.

287
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,462
But I went out
and achieved anyway.

288
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,696
(CHUCKLES)

289
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,860
I cannot solve
your problems, sir.
Only you can.

290
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,504
Well, fuck it.
Oh, fuck it.

291
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:34,640
Yes, that's your answer.
That's your answer
to everything.

292
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,476
Tattoo it on your forehead!

293
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:39,045
Your revolution is over,
Mr. Lebowski!

294
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:42,382
Condolences! The bums lost!

295
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:45,651
My advice to you is to do
what your parents did!

296
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,587
Get a job, sir!

297
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:50,189
The bums will
always lose!

298
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,058
Do you hear me,
Lebowski?

299
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,460
The bums will
always lose.

300
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:58,097
How was your meeting,
Mr. Lebowski?

301
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,665
Okay.

302
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,158
The old man told me to take
any rug in the house.

303
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,604
Well, enjoy.

304
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:07,240
And perhaps we'll see you
again sometime, Dude.

305
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,441
Yeah, sure.

306
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:11,377
If I'm in the neighborhood,
you know,

309
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:27,787
Blow on them.
Huh?

310
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,128
Go ahead. Blow.

311
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:35,267
You want me to blow
on your toes?

312

You're right, Dude.

974
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:38,101

975
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:43,941
Well, sure, man.
Look at it. You know?

976

in the parlance of
our times, you know.

all over town, including
to known pornographers.

needs money, man.

of course they're gonna
say they didn't get it

981
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:09,967
because she wants more, man.

982

She's gotta feed the monkey.
I mean...

983

occurred to you, man?

985
00:51:21,146 --> 00:51:24,615
No, Mr. Lebowski,
it had not occurred
to me.

986
00:51:24,616 --> 00:51:26,917
That had not
occurred to us, Dude.

987
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:28,452
Well, okay, you know?

988
00:51:28,453 --> 00:51:33,057

to all the new shit,
so, you know...

give me my $20,000 in cash?

993
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:47,538
My concern is, and
I've gotta check it
with my accountant,

994
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:50,341
that this might bump me up
into a higher tax...

this morning.

failed to achieve,

999

even in the modest task
which was your charge,

1000
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:12,563
since you have
stolen my money,

1001
00:52:12,564 --> 00:52:16,333
since you have
unrepentantly
betrayed my trust,

1002
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:20,371
I have no choice
but to tell these bums

1003
00:52:20,372 --> 00:52:22,673
to do whatever is necessary

1004
00:52:22,674 --> 00:52:26,804
to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

1005
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,216
And with Brandt as my witness,
I will tell you this,

any further harm
visited upon Bunny

1007

about it indicates...

Fine, Dude.

1015

some nail polish, apply it
to someone else's toe...

I can get you a toe.

there are ways, Dude.

about it, believe me.
Yeah, but, Walter...

1021

by 3:00 this afternoon

Hello, Dude.
Thanks for coming.

A White Russian. Thanks.

How's the smut business,

I wouldn't know, Dude.

1391

Which one's Logjammin'?
Yes, regrettably, it's true.

1393

Standards have fallen
in adult entertainment.

It's video, Dude.

1395
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:22,311
Now that we're competing
with those amateurs,

1396
01:16:22,312 --> 01:16:25,839
we can't afford to invest
in little extras like story,

1397
01:16:26,716 --> 01:16:29,618

is the biggest erogenous zone.

Well, I thought you
might know that, man.
Why would l?

She only ran off
to get away from that
rather sizable debt to me.

1411
01:17:12,929 --> 01:17:15,397
No, she didn't run off.

I know you're mixed up
in all this, Dude.

1414
01:17:21,204 --> 01:17:24,406
And I don't care
what you're trying
to get from the husband.

All I'm saying is I want mine.

Yeah, right, man.

1418

Forgive me.
No problemo, man.

1428

So, if I can find your money,

1429
01:18:44,788 --> 01:18:46,755
what's in it for the Dude?

1430
01:18:46,756 --> 01:18:49,992
Well, of course,
there's that to discuss.

you do business, man.

held by a kid named

I tripped on a cloud
and fell-a eight miles high

in a deep, dark hole

And then I followed it in

1469
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:46,468
I watched myself crawlin' out

As I was a-crawlin' in

1471

(MEN SPEAKING GERMAN)

1684
01:35:12,808 --> 01:35:16,210
I mean, we totally
fucked it up, man.
We fucked up his payoff.

1685
01:35:16,211 --> 01:35:18,479
We got the kidnappers
all pissed off.

1686
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,815
And Lebowski, you know,
he yelled at me a lot,

1687
01:35:20,816 --> 01:35:23,084
but he didn't do
anything, huh?

1688
01:35:23,085 --> 01:35:25,353
Well, sometimes
it's a cathartic...
No, no.

1689
01:35:25,354 --> 01:35:27,755
I'm saying that
if he knows I'm a fuckup,

1690
01:35:27,756 --> 01:35:30,191
why does he leave me
in charge of getting
his wife back?

1691
01:35:30,192 --> 01:35:33,628
DUDE: Because he doesn't
fucking want her back, man.

1692
01:35:33,629 --> 01:35:36,898
He's had enough.
He no longer digs her.
It's all a show.

1693
01:35:36,899 --> 01:35:41,369
Okay, but then
why doesn't he give a shit
about his million bucks?

1694
01:35:41,370 --> 01:35:44,238
I mean, he knows we never
handed off his briefcase,

1695
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:46,307
(THUNDER CRASHING)
but he never asked
for it back.

1696
01:35:46,308 --> 01:35:49,403
The million bucks
was never in the briefcase.

1697
01:35:50,079 --> 01:35:53,181
The briefcase was
fucking empty, man.

1698
01:35:53,182 --> 01:35:55,950
The asshole was hoping
that they would kill her.

1699
01:35:55,951 --> 01:35:58,586
You threw out a ringer
for a ringer.

1700
01:35:58,587 --> 01:36:02,390
Okay, but how does
all this add up to
an emergency?

1701
01:36:02,391 --> 01:36:06,694
I'm saying, I see what
you're getting at, Dude.
He kept the money.

1702
01:36:06,695 --> 01:36:08,630
My point is...

1703
01:36:08,631 --> 01:36:11,933
Here we are, it's shabbos,
the Sabbath,

1704

life or death.

Will you come off it,
Walter? You're not even
fucking Jewish, man.

1706
01:36:19,475 --> 01:36:21,209

you talking about?

are you talking about?

1709
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:26,581

I married Cynthia.
Come on, Dude.

1710
01:36:26,582 --> 01:36:28,683
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know this.

1711
01:36:28,684 --> 01:36:31,019
And five fucking years ago,
you were divorced.

1712
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:32,587
So what are you saying?
When you get divorced,

1713
01:36:32,588 --> 01:36:34,822
you turn in your library card?
You get a new license?

1714
01:36:34,823 --> 01:36:37,992
You stop being Jewish?
This is the driveway.

1715

Man.

Visiting friends of hers
in Palm Springs.

1730

She just picked up and left,

that we were fighting

hear, Dude.

some tank battles,

Hey, look, pal.

1831
01:42:20,002 --> 01:42:21,802
DUDE: There never
was any money.

1832
01:42:21,803 --> 01:42:24,005
The big Lebowski gave me
an empty briefcase,

1833
01:42:24,006 --> 01:42:26,140
so take it up with him, man.

1834
01:42:26,141 --> 01:42:28,743
And I would like
my undies back.

1835
01:42:28,744 --> 01:42:30,044
Are these guys gonna
hurt us, Walter?

1836
01:42:30,045 --> 01:42:32,613
No, Donny.
These men are cowards.

1837
01:42:32,614 --> 01:42:33,981
Okay!

1838
01:42:33,982 --> 01:42:37,509
So we takes the money
you have on you, and
we calls it even.

1839
01:42:38,954 --> 01:42:41,055
Fuck you.
Hey, no. Come on, Walter.

1840
01:42:41,056 --> 01:42:43,157
Come on, we're ending
this thing cheap, man.

1841
01:42:43,158 --> 01:42:45,826
No. What's mine is mine.
No, come on, Walter.

1842
01:42:45,827 --> 01:42:48,129
No funny stuff.
All right. All right.

1843
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:52,967
No funny stuff.
I got 4 bucks, almost 5.

1844
01:42:52,968 --> 01:42:55,603
I got $1.
WALTER: What's mine is mine.

Oh, God. They shot him, man.

He's not shot. No, Dude.
Are you shot, Donny?

1868
01:44:03,572 --> 01:44:05,940
There weren't
any shots fired.
Huh?

1869
01:44:05,941 --> 01:44:09,172
It's a heart attack.
Call the medics, Dude.

1870
01:44:09,744 --> 01:44:12,646
I'd go myself,
but I'm pumping blood,
might pass out.

1871
01:44:12,647 --> 01:44:16,050
Rest easy, good buddy.
You're doing fine.

Excuse me?
Oh, nothing.

Yes. I understand
you're taking away
the remains?

1881
01:45:07,569 --> 01:45:08,764
Yeah.

1882
01:45:09,504 --> 01:45:11,302
We have the urn.

1883
01:45:12,674 --> 01:45:14,870
I assume this is credit card?

Now, that's for the urn.

1888
01:45:35,797 --> 01:45:37,822
Don't need it.
We're scattering the ashes.

1889
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:41,335
Yes. So we were informed.

1890
01:45:41,336 --> 01:45:45,139
However, we must, of course,
transmit the remains to you

1891
01:45:45,140 --> 01:45:46,733
in a receptacle.

1892
01:45:47,976 --> 01:45:49,774
That's $10.

1893
01:45:50,111 --> 01:45:54,048
It is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

1894
01:45:54,382 --> 01:45:56,617
Well, can't we just...
$10?

1895
01:45:56,618 --> 01:45:58,609
They range up to $3,000.

1896
01:45:59,421 --> 01:46:02,623
We're...
Can't we just rent it
from you, you know?

1897
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:05,559
Sir, this is a mortuary
not a rental house.

We're scattering
the fucking ashes!
Walter, Walter.

doesn't make us saps.

your voices.

you know, something else
we can put him in?

01:46:18,306 --> 01:46:21,367

(SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)

1907
01:46:54,042 --> 01:46:56,704
Donny was a good bowler
and a good man.

1908
01:46:57,979 --> 01:47:00,180
He was one of us.

1909
01:47:00,181 --> 01:47:04,118
He was a man who loved
the outdoors and bowling.

1910
01:47:04,252 --> 01:47:08,055
And as a surfer
he explored the beaches
of Southern California

1911
01:47:08,056 --> 01:47:10,958
from La Jolla to Leo Carrillo

1912
01:47:10,959 --> 01:47:13,519
and up to Pismo.

1913
01:47:14,329 --> 01:47:15,592
He died...

1914
01:47:16,564 --> 01:47:20,768
He died as so many young men
of his generation,
before his time.

1915
01:47:20,769 --> 01:47:24,038
In your wisdom, Lord,
you took him,

1916
01:47:24,039 --> 01:47:27,441
as you took so many bright,
flowering young men

1917
01:47:27,442 --> 01:47:30,344
at Khe Sanh, at Lan Doc,

1918
01:47:30,345 --> 01:47:32,074
at Hill 364.

1919
01:47:33,381 --> 01:47:35,748
These young men
gave their lives,

1920

and so did Donny.

I wondered if
I'd see you again.

I wouldn't miss
the semis.

Well, you know,

ups and downs.

1960
01:50:37,532 --> 01:50:40,228

I know that you will.

Yeah. Well,

1966

1967
01:51:00,889 --> 01:51:02,857
The Dude abides.

1968
01:51:06,761 --> 01:51:10,095
I don't know about you,
but I take comfort in that.

1969
01:51:11,399 --> 01:51:13,700
It's good knowing
he's out there,

1970
01:51:13,701 --> 01:51:17,763
the Dude, taking her easy
for all us sinners.

1971
01:51:20,508 --> 01:51:22,670
I sure hope
he makes the finals.

1972
01:51:24,279 --> 01:51:26,480
Well, that about does her.

1973
01:51:26,481 --> 01:51:27,971
Wraps her all up.

1974
01:51:29,584 --> 01:51:33,043
Things seem to have
worked out pretty good
for the Dude and Walter.

1975
01:51:33,721 --> 01:51:36,987
And it was
a pretty good story,
don't you think?

1976
01:51:37,859 --> 01:51:40,191
Made me laugh
to beat the band.

1977
01:51:40,828 --> 01:51:42,296
Parts anyway.

1978
01:51:43,865 --> 01:51:46,027
I didn't like seeing Donny go.

1979
01:51:47,135 --> 01:51:52,164
But then I happen to know
that there's a little
Lebowski on the way.

1980
01:51:53,841 --> 01:51:57,175
I guess that's the way
the whole darned
human comedy keeps

1981
01:51:57,745 --> 01:52:00,147
perpetuating itself

1982
01:52:00,148 --> 01:52:02,310
down through the generations.

1983
01:52:02,817 --> 01:52:07,084
Westward the wagons,
across the sands of time
until we...

Oh, look at me.
I'm rambling again.

1985
01:52:12,894 --> 01:52:15,386
Well, I hope you folks
enjoyed yourselves.

1986
01:52:15,863 --> 01:52:18,196
Catch you later on
down the trail.

1987
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:22,495
Say, friend, you got any more
of that good sarsaparilla?

1988
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:49,529
Take me down, little Susie

1989
01:52:49,530 --> 01:52:51,362
Take me down

1990
01:52:54,669 --> 01:52:57,270
I know you think
you're the queen

1991
01:52:57,271 --> 01:52:59,365
Of the underground

1992
01:53:03,077 --> 01:53:08,038
Send me dead flowers
every morning

1993
01:53:11,419 --> 01:53:15,947
Send me dead flowers
by the mail

1994
01:53:19,727 --> 01:53:24,187
Send me dead flowers
to my wedding

1995
01:53:26,734 --> 01:53:33,902
And I won't forget to put
roses on your grave

1996
01:53:35,009 --> 01:53:39,413
No, I won't forget
to put roses

1997
01:53:39,414 --> 01:53:43,714
On your grave

1998
01:53:48,189 --> 01:53:50,487
(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

1999
01:54:08,843 --> 01:54:13,371
Bright light city
gonna set my soul

2000
01:54:13,848 --> 01:54:17,546
Gonna set my soul on fire

2001
01:54:18,886 --> 01:54:24,091
Got a whole lot of money
that's ready to burn

2002
01:54:24,092 --> 01:54:27,721
So get those stakes up higher

2003
01:54:29,297 --> 01:54:34,064
There's a thousand pretty
women livin' out there

2004
01:54:34,802 --> 01:54:39,973
They're all livin'
devil may care

2005
01:54:39,974 --> 01:54:44,544
And I'm just a devil
with love to spare

2006
01:54:44,545 --> 01:54:48,778
So viva Las Vegas

2007
01:54:50,318 --> 01:54:54,380
Viva Las Vegas

2008
01:54:58,092 --> 01:55:02,829
Viva Las Vegas
with your neon flashing

2009
01:55:02,830 --> 01:55:05,866
And your one-arm
bandits crashing

2010
01:55:05,867 --> 01:55:09,462
All those hopes down the drain

2011
01:55:11,038 --> 01:55:16,309
Viva Las Vegas turnin'
day into nighttime

2012
01:55:16,310 --> 01:55:18,879
Night into daytime

2013
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:21,148
If you see it once

2014
01:55:21,149 --> 01:55:27,554
You'll never be the same again

2015
01:55:29,624 --> 01:55:34,161
I'm gonna keep on
keep on runnin'

2016
01:55:34,162 --> 01:55:37,893
If it costs me
my very last dime

2017
01:55:39,433 --> 01:55:41,835
If I wind up broke

2018
01:55:41,836 --> 01:55:44,137
Well, I'll always remember

2019
01:55:44,138 --> 01:55:48,166
That I had a swingin' time

2020
01:55:50,011 --> 01:55:54,107
I'm gonna give it
everything I've got

2021
01:55:55,216 --> 01:55:59,448
Lady Luck, please
let the dice stay hot

2022
01:56:00,388 --> 01:56:04,991
et me shoot a seven
on every shot

2023
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:09,191
So viva Las Vegas

2024
01:56:10,731 --> 01:56:14,497
Viva Las Vegas

2025
01:56:15,870 --> 01:56:20,068
Viva Las Vegas

2026
01:56:20,942 --> 01:56:22,808
Viva

2027

Viva

2028
01:56:26,280 --> 01:56:27,771
Viva

2029
01:56:28,883 --> 01:56:32,114
Viva

2030
01:56:33,387 --> 01:56:40,191

2031
01:56:44,532 --> 01:56:47,831
Viva
