Shiho? You' r e back alr eady?

166
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:56,508
I' m beat!

167
00:13:57,216 --> 00:14:00,708
I got a ride with someone
who was coming this way.

168
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:03,414
Where' s Mom?

169
00:14:03,556 --> 00:14:06,491
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Oad' s at work.

170
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:09,723
You could clean up a little...

171
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:11,586
What about dinner?

172
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:13,163
I' m going to wash the rice.

173
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:16,292
Shizuku! The br eakf ast things
ar e still out!

174
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:18,894
I' m getting to it!

175
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,442
Mom' s busy! We' ve got to help!

176
00:14:30,216 --> 00:14:34,243
Do the rice and put away the washing.
I' II take a shower and make dinner.

177
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:39,550
Aunt says come see her
when you get into high school.

178
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:42,460
Ar e you studying?

179
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:47,221
Don' t think you can take it easy
just because Mom and Dad don' t bug you.

180
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,498
I know!

181
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:53,728
She even wanted me
to bring home soy sauce!

182
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,864
That' s your aunt, all right.

183
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:59,239
It was the same thing last year.

184
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:02,872
Yes! It was <i>miso</i>! Boy, was it heavy!

185
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:05,109
Two kilos of it!

186
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:23,597
Shizuku! Get up and vacuum
by your desk!

187
00:15:24,136 --> 00:15:25,865
I' m washing the sheets.

188
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:27,968
And airing the bedding.

189
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:30,568
Where' s Mom?

190
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:31,870
Long gone.

191
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:39,414
Put that stuf f away
and take Dad his lunch.

192
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:40,507
Me?!

193
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,087
Why not? You' r e going to the library.

194
00:15:45,524 --> 00:15:47,515
Shall I go instead?

195
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,024
And you' II clean the toilet, the bath
and the balcony and go to the Co-op?

196
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:56,899
Don' t f orget to turn the bedding
and f ix dinner.

197
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,139
I' m going!

198
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:09,942
Shizuku!

199
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,641
Mail these. will you?

200
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:13,980
What?

201
00:16:14,153 --> 00:16:16,280
M-A-l-L!

202
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:23,757
You don' t have to read them!

203
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:26,260
Take the paper-clip off.

204
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:27,824
Your boyf riend?

205
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:29,059
Idiot!

206
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:27,620
Hey cat...ar e you alone?

207
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:33,630
Where are you going?

208
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:38,893
What' s out there?

209
00:17:41,006 --> 00:17:43,133
Hey! Answer me!

210
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:57,923
I get off here. What about you?

211
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:03,861
See you.

212
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:18,700
Hey! A cat!

213
00:18:38,964 --> 00:18:40,522
The library' s that way!

214
00:19:04,557 --> 00:19:08,584
And it f elt just like
the start of a story...

215
00:19:44,663 --> 00:19:45,857
There he is!

216
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:14,054
<i>No Entrance</i>

217
00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:43,586
What a hill! How f ar up is he going?

218
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,107
Cat?

219
00:21:05,511 --> 00:21:06,910
Cat?

220
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:13,717
Does he live around here?

221
00:21:45,818 --> 00:21:49,413
<i>H</i>ey, cat! Wher e ar e you going?
Do you live around her e?

222
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:13,210
I never knew ther e was a place
like this way up her e...

223
00:22:32,464 --> 00:22:35,922
That' s not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!

224
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:51,446
Maybe you' r e teasing me, too.

225
00:23:43,902 --> 00:23:47,338
I never guessed ther e was a stor e
like this up here either...

226
00:24:16,268 --> 00:24:18,168
Cool!

227
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:28,212
Ar e you that cat?

228
00:24:40,592 --> 00:24:41,684
Oh, hello...

229
00:24:41,794 --> 00:24:42,818
Um...

230
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:46,830
That' s all right. Look ar ound
all you want.

231
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:49,225
The Bar on gets bor ed.

232
00:24:50,502 --> 00:24:53,300
Is this doll 'the Bar on'?

233
00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:58,240
Yep. Bar on <i>H</i>umbert von Jechingen.
Quite the name...

234
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:09,179
Sorry.

235
00:25:09,788 --> 00:25:11,551
Thanks. I' m f ine now.

236
00:25:11,657 --> 00:25:13,215
That' s a great clock.

237
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:16,988
It was sitting in some castle,
all rusted out.

238
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:18,187
Look...

239
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,936
It' s beautiful. What is it?

240
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,440
Wait and see.

241
00:26:10,716 --> 00:26:12,877
What great dwarf s!

242
00:26:12,985 --> 00:26:18,423
So you' r e a young lady
who knows about dwarf s, are you?

243
00:26:20,492 --> 00:26:24,394
Watch the f ace...if it works.

244
00:26:42,648 --> 00:26:43,512
A f airy!

245
00:26:43,615 --> 00:26:46,413
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.

246
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,918
A princess?

247
00:26:53,091 --> 00:26:54,115
That' s right.

248
00:27:04,202 --> 00:27:06,227
Are they in love?

249
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:11,141
But they live in diff er ent worlds.
He' s king of the dwarf s.

250
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:16,770
Only while the clock is striking 12
is she changed back fr om a sheep.

251
00:27:16,982 --> 00:27:20,679
But he appears every hour...

252
00:27:20,786 --> 00:27:22,447
... and waits f or her.

253
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:28,590
The artisan who made this
must have been disappointed in love.

254
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:33,020
That' s why they both look so sad...

255
00:27:36,702 --> 00:27:38,465
This clock' s f ast, isn' t it...

256
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,164
Only about f ive minutes. though.

257
00:27:41,273 --> 00:27:42,501
Oh. no!

258
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:46,143
I' ve got to be at the library!

259
00:27:46,845 --> 00:27:48,745
Can I come back sometime?

260
00:27:49,481 --> 00:27:52,882
Sur e...but go lef t
to get to the library!

261
00:28:04,796 --> 00:28:06,593
I' m right above it!

262
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,298
What a f ind! A place
where stories start!

263
00:28:17,476 --> 00:28:18,909
Fantastic!

264
00:28:20,512 --> 00:28:21,809
Tsukishima!

265
00:28:22,014 --> 00:28:23,641
Tsukishima Shizuku!

266
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:27,913
Isn' t this yours?

267
00:28:33,692 --> 00:28:35,557
Forgetful, ar en' t you.

268
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:37,524
Thanks...but how...?

269
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:39,426
Guess!

270
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:44,734
The cat! Is that your cat?

271
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,231
You sure eat a big lunch!

272
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:50,498
No!

273
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:54,167
'Concr ete r oads, everywher e' ...

274
00:28:55,514 --> 00:28:57,744
It' s not mine! Hey!

275
00:29:00,252 --> 00:29:01,446
Oh, her e you ar e...

276
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:07,153
What' s wrong with you?

277
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:09,559
It' s har d to explain.

278
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:14,328
I f elt like I' d f ound
a treasur e hidden in a cave.

279
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:17,163
Then what someone said
buried me alive.

280
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:19,303
Sounds complicated.

281
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,207
Getting mor e books?

282
00:29:23,308 --> 00:29:25,776
Seven more to go.

283
00:29:25,877 --> 00:29:28,368
Still at it? What about lunch?

284
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,469
I' II buy something.

285
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:32,106
You will? Thanks. then.

286
00:29:54,139 --> 00:29:55,834
June 16 th...

287
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:59,908
Wow! Amasawa' s r ead this one, too!

288
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:03,138
What' s he like?

289
00:30:06,451 --> 00:30:08,351
No! He' s not you!

290
00:31:01,907 --> 00:31:04,307
Shizuku! Hurry!

291
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:07,104
I' m late!

292
00:31:08,446 --> 00:31:09,538
Pass my umbr ella.

293
00:31:13,084 --> 00:31:15,575
Rain every day this term!

294
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:19,956
At least you' r e studying
because you want to.

295
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:21,214
Sorry.

296
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:23,120
Study har d!

297
00:31:23,228 --> 00:31:24,695
Don' t you worry!

298
00:31:32,571 --> 00:31:33,469
Shizuku!

299
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:34,504
Hi!

300
00:31:34,606 --> 00:31:36,198
Hurry! We' II be late!

301
00:31:37,742 --> 00:31:39,801
I hate all these tests!

302
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:41,879
One every day!

303
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:48,447
Did you answer?

304
00:31:48,553 --> 00:31:49,577
No.

305
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:51,121
Did he say anything?

306
00:31:52,057 --> 00:31:53,615
I' m going to say no.

307
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:57,219
Yeah? Maybe that' s best.

308
00:31:57,329 --> 00:31:58,819
Sugimura!

309
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:01,565
Better hurry!

310
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,100
I know!

311
00:32:13,445 --> 00:32:15,845
Time' s up. Gather the papers.

312
00:32:22,087 --> 00:32:23,816
See you this af ternoon.

313
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,750
Let' s go see Miss Kosaka.

314
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:31,658
Let me go to the teachers' room first.

315
00:32:31,763 --> 00:32:32,752
Sure.

316
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:35,156
- Tsukishima!
- What?

317
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:37,428
I lucked out on the test!

318
00:32:37,535 --> 00:32:38,695
Isn' t that nice.

319
00:32:39,037 --> 00:32:41,699
Everything I studied was on it!

320
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,506
So you' re not just a baseball goof...

321
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:48,705
Yuko' s good at guessing, too.
Why not study with her?

322
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:50,145
With Harada?

323
00:32:50,248 --> 00:32:52,216
- <i>H</i>ey, Sugimura!
- What?

324
00:32:53,518 --> 00:32:54,849
Come on!

325
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:02,358
Stop fixing me up!

326
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,484
Was it obvious?

327
00:33:03,595 --> 00:33:05,620
I never just guess!

328
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,754
Sorry!

329
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:09,799
Excuse me...

330
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:16,403
A library-book donor?
Gee, I don' t know...

331
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:20,508
Sorry to bother you at lunch-time.
There' s this stamp in it.

332
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:23,275
Oh...

333
00:33:25,984 --> 00:33:28,350
That' s Dr Amasawa.

334
00:33:28,453 --> 00:33:30,478
I' ve r ead it. It' s a good book!

335
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:32,117
Yes, very.

336
00:33:32,223 --> 00:33:34,987
What kind of person is he?

337
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:39,395
<i>H</i>e was chairman of the PTA
a f ew years ago.

338
00:33:39,497 --> 00:33:43,297
The PTA? Would you know
his given name?

339
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:45,096
His given name?

340
00:33:45,203 --> 00:33:49,663
Mr Kimura, do you r emember
that Dr Amasawa' s given name?

341
00:33:49,774 --> 00:33:53,005
Dr Amasawa? It was 'Koichi' .

342
00:33:53,611 --> 00:33:55,010
Amasawa Koichi...

343
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,679
<i>H</i>is youngest son' s in your year,
Tsukishima. You don' t know him?

344
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:02,919
He is?!

345
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:04,913
Thank you very much!

346
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:07,622
Goodbye!

347
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,986
Sorry!

348
00:34:12,163 --> 00:34:14,688
Shizuku, wher e ar e you going?

349
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:18,259
What a surprise!

350
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,928
Tell me about it!

351
00:34:20,772 --> 00:34:23,172
What' s with you?!

352
00:34:24,142 --> 00:34:25,370
Sorry!

353
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:36,946
Hey, where are you going?

354
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:55,899
He ignored me! Of all the nerve!

355
00:34:56,007 --> 00:34:58,874
Who is he? Wher e ar e you going?

356
00:34:58,977 --> 00:35:01,673
<i>H</i>e' s a jerk! <i>H</i>e won' t make me
avoid him!

357
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:08,213
I' ve been carrying her lunch
all over!

358
00:35:09,721 --> 00:35:12,019
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?!

359
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:16,526
Looks like springtime has come
f or Shizuku at last!

360
00:35:16,628 --> 00:35:18,357
It isn' t true!

361
00:35:18,496 --> 00:35:21,624
You met a prince
fr om one of your books?

362
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:22,791
Is he handsome?

363
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:25,461
I just want to f ind out what he' s like!

364
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:29,631
Come on, Yuko, you hear d his name.
Tell us!

365
00:35:30,408 --> 00:35:31,375
Yuko!

366
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:33,540
It happened too f ast.

367
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:37,581
'Ma', something, 'Masaki', maybe...

368
00:35:37,682 --> 00:35:38,649
Hmm?

369
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,182
Hmm...

370
00:35:40,285 --> 00:35:45,154
But it' s like Tsukishima to run out
without hearing the end of something.

371
00:35:45,323 --> 00:35:48,121
You want to know, but you don' t...

372
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:52,158
Your heart beats
in misery and ecstasy!

373
00:35:52,263 --> 00:35:55,426
How terribly romantic!

374
00:35:56,334 --> 00:36:01,397
Should you r eally tease a girl
who has just written your lyric?

375
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:03,700
- You f inished?!
- Let' s see!

376
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:09,907
O Shizuku! O gr eat poet!
We will not transgr ess again!

377
00:36:11,182 --> 00:36:12,479
All right, then.

378
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:14,913
I' m not sur e...

379
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:21,954
I don' t know about old home towns,
so I wr ote about what I f eel.

380
00:36:22,126 --> 00:36:24,287
This is gr eat!

381
00:36:24,562 --> 00:36:29,659
'Country r oad. this old r oad...

382
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:34,871
'lf I go right to the end...

383
00:36:35,106 --> 00:36:40,043
'Got a f eeling it' II take me...

384
00:36:40,144 --> 00:36:44,945
'...to that town, country road.'

385
00:36:45,483 --> 00:36:47,713
This is good, Shizuku. I like it.

386
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:49,716
It' s not har d to sing?

387
00:36:49,888 --> 00:36:51,082
We' II manage.

388
00:36:51,189 --> 00:36:55,455
We can give this to the juniors
and sing it at the teachers' thank-you!

389
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,857
There, too?!

390
00:36:56,961 --> 00:36:57,791
Slow down!

391
00:36:57,896 --> 00:36:59,363
I like this part.

392
00:36:59,464 --> 00:37:03,730
'I left because I was alone
and I had nothing...

393
00:37:03,935 --> 00:37:07,871
'Pushed away my sadness
and pr etended I was strong... '

394
00:37:07,972 --> 00:37:10,236
Ladies, the bell.

395
00:37:17,882 --> 00:37:20,112
The sun' s come out!

396
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:21,450
Shizuku!

397
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:25,750
Come to the choir r oom!
We' II show them your lyrics.

398
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,222
No. I' m going to the library.

399
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:30,453
There' s another test tomorr ow...

400
00:37:30,929 --> 00:37:32,226
I' II study ther e.

401
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,490
Bookworm!

402
00:37:34,165 --> 00:37:35,189
'Bye

403
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,037
Harada...

404
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,540
Can I talk to you f or a minute?

405
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,747
It' s closed.

406
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:34,523
Have these flowers been watered?

407
00:38:46,304 --> 00:38:50,240
Bar on' s gone... maybe someone bought him.

408
00:38:56,347 --> 00:38:59,646
<i>World Emporium;Nishi Shiro</i>, <i>Prop</i>.

409
00:39:00,184 --> 00:39:04,211
'Nishi Shiro'...maybe that jerk' s name
is 'Nishi', too.

410
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:20,636
Shizuku! Shizuku!

411
00:39:25,877 --> 00:39:27,504
Yuko' s on the phone!

412
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:30,244
You' II go deaf, Shizuku.

413
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:32,175
Yuko?

414
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,218
What? I can' t hear you.

415
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,688
I' II be ther e in a minute.

416
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,849
'Bye.

417
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:43,719
- Wher e ar e you going?
- Not f ar.

418
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:52,327
What' s wrong?

419
00:39:53,237 --> 00:39:54,568
Shizuku!

420
00:39:54,672 --> 00:39:57,197
What' s the matter?

421
00:39:57,475 --> 00:39:59,568
What am I going to do?!

422
00:39:59,677 --> 00:40:05,411
The guy who wrote the letter got
Sugimura to ask me to answer it!

423
00:40:07,151 --> 00:40:09,711
Uh-oh...

424
00:40:11,022 --> 00:40:13,422
Why you, of all people?!

425
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,254
Hey!

426
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:22,161
That guy is so dense!

427
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,696
But he doesn' t know
how you f eel about him...

428
00:40:28,706 --> 00:40:35,771
I' II apologize to him. But I can' t go
to school tomorrow looking like this.

429
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,277
And miss the test?

430
00:40:37,782 --> 00:40:38,749
Yeah.

431
00:40:39,584 --> 00:40:40,778
Oh.

432
00:41:00,338 --> 00:41:01,362
Idiot!

433
00:41:04,008 --> 00:41:05,305
What?

434
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:08,709
It was easy.

435
00:41:08,813 --> 00:41:10,781
The library again, Shizuku?

436
00:41:10,882 --> 00:41:11,940
I' m going to Yuko' s.

437
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:14,108
Say hello.

438
00:41:22,627 --> 00:41:24,527
Tsukishima!

439
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:27,025
Wait up!

440
00:41:33,871 --> 00:41:35,634
About Harada...

441
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:48,150
...then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?

442
00:41:49,887 --> 00:41:54,483
She said, 'Why you, of all people,'
didn' t she?

443
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:57,985
Yeah. A guy on the baseball team
asked me.

444
00:41:58,462 --> 00:41:59,952
No!

445
00:42:00,064 --> 00:42:03,192
She didn' t want to hear something
like that f rom you!

446
00:42:03,301 --> 00:42:04,734
Don' t you under stand?!

447
00:42:05,136 --> 00:42:06,694
No, I don' t!

448
00:42:07,171 --> 00:42:08,160
Tell me!

449
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:13,570
You r eally ar e dense, you know!
She likes you!

450
00:42:14,111 --> 00:42:17,569
What?! No way! I don' t need this!

451
00:42:18,115 --> 00:42:23,075
<i>You</i> don' t? <i>Ho</i>w do you think Yuko f eels?!
She stayed home sick today!

452
00:42:23,654 --> 00:42:27,090
But...I like you!

453
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:28,550
What?!

454
00:42:29,627 --> 00:42:31,993
Don' t make jokes
at a time like this!

455
00:42:32,096 --> 00:42:33,324
It' s not a joke!

456
00:42:33,431 --> 00:42:35,365
I' ve liked you f or a long time!

457
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:39,365
Not me! You can' t!

458
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,705
You don' t like me? Or do you have
a boyf riend?

459
00:42:43,307 --> 00:42:45,468
I don' t have a boyfriend...

460
00:42:46,577 --> 00:42:47,737
But...

461
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:48,973
I' m sorry!

462
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:49,874
Wait!

463
00:42:50,514 --> 00:42:52,379
Tell me the truth!

464
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:58,856
But we' ve always been f riends...
I like you. but not...

465
00:43:01,993 --> 00:43:04,257
I' m sorry. I can' t say what I mean.

466
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:12,260
Just friends?

467
00:43:15,106 --> 00:43:16,573
For ever?

468
00:43:21,946 --> 00:43:23,208
I see...

469
00:44:10,761 --> 00:44:13,457
I m the one who' s dense!

470
00:44:24,275 --> 00:44:27,142
The par cel delivery lef t this with me.

471
00:44:27,244 --> 00:44:29,644
Thank you...again!

472
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:46,186
You don' t have to do this!

473
00:44:46,297 --> 00:44:48,822
We couldn' t eat all these ourselves.

474
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,931
Oh, you' re home...

475
00:44:52,103 --> 00:44:52,933
Shizuku?

476
00:46:14,051 --> 00:46:15,712
Hi.

477
00:46:17,788 --> 00:46:19,278
Have you been shut out, too?

478
00:46:23,027 --> 00:46:26,485
Do you live here? Ar e you hungry?

479
00:46:30,234 --> 00:46:33,499
You' r e not very nice. Just like me.

480
00:46:36,373 --> 00:46:41,504
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet...

481
00:46:42,146 --> 00:46:46,082
Books don' t even excite me
like they used to.

482
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:51,483
There' s always someone inside me
saying, 'Things aren' t that easy!'

483
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:53,450
I' m not very nice.

484
00:47:18,816 --> 00:47:20,306
Hey! Tsukishima!

485
00:47:22,386 --> 00:47:24,377
Moon lets you pet him?

486
00:47:24,755 --> 00:47:26,746
Moon, you' r e not coming in?

487
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:28,586
Is that his name?

488
00:47:28,692 --> 00:47:30,785
He' s like a full moon.

489
00:47:31,095 --> 00:47:33,461
That' s why I call him that.

490
00:47:37,768 --> 00:47:39,827
Isn' t he yours?

491
00:47:39,937 --> 00:47:41,734
He won' t stay in one house.

492
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,104
I hear d him called 'Ball' at one place.

493
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:47,502

494
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,373
So he does the r ounds...

495
00:47:51,749 --> 00:47:54,343
Yes! He commutes, on the train!

496
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:56,081
The train?

497
00:47:56,587 --> 00:48:01,081
Yes, by himself! That' s how
I came her e. I f ollowed him.

498
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:06,085
And he br ought me to a neat stor e,
just like out of a story.

499
00:48:06,964 --> 00:48:08,090
I insulted him.

500
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:13,593
I said he wasn' t very nice.
Just like me.

501
00:48:14,305 --> 00:48:17,365
You' r e not like Moon at all!

502
00:48:17,942 --> 00:48:21,105
He' s half-devil, he is.

503
00:48:29,086 --> 00:48:30,280
- Um...
- Would you...

504
00:48:32,723 --> 00:48:36,784
Is your gr andf ather sick?
The store' s been closed and I thought...

505
00:48:36,894 --> 00:48:40,921
<i>H</i>e' s f ine. It' s a weir d stor e.
He doesn' t open very often.

506
00:48:41,031 --> 00:48:42,896
I' m glad he' s all right.

507
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,902
I can' t see Bar on thr ough the window.
Did he sell him?

508
00:48:47,004 --> 00:48:50,269
That cat doll? You want to see it?
Come on.

509
00:49:00,985 --> 00:49:02,009
Close the door.

510
00:49:22,373 --> 00:49:24,637
It' s like we' r e in the sky!

511
00:49:33,317 --> 00:49:34,341
Afraid of heights?

512
00:49:34,451 --> 00:49:37,352
No, I like high places. This is gr eat.

513
00:49:44,161 --> 00:49:46,459
This is the time it looks best.

514
00:49:46,563 --> 00:49:47,495
In her e.

Perf ect timing.

516
00:50:12,956 --> 00:50:14,321
Sit there.

517
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:15,717
The clock' s gone!

518
00:50:16,293 --> 00:50:18,261
The one that was there?

519
00:50:19,196 --> 00:50:21,858
Grandpa' s delivering it today.

520
00:50:22,099 --> 00:50:23,361
Did he sell it?

521
00:50:24,101 --> 00:50:26,001
It was her e being f ixed.

522
00:50:26,103 --> 00:50:29,095
I wanted to see it again.

523
00:50:29,206 --> 00:50:33,040
It took thr ee years. <i>H</i>e f inished it
the day you f orgot your lunch.

524
00:50:33,143 --> 00:50:34,371
That lunch!

525
00:50:34,812 --> 00:50:37,508
I know it wasn' t yours.

526
00:50:37,614 --> 00:50:39,445
Look into the cat' s eyes.

527
00:50:42,286 --> 00:50:44,618
Quick. bef or e the light goes.

528
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,163
<i>Engelzimmer</i>... 'angel' s room' .

529
00:51:00,304 --> 00:51:03,705
The artisan accidentally
scratched it with a cloth.

530
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,468
It' s beautiful.

531
00:51:05,676 --> 00:51:08,770
The Bar on won' t go. He' s a tr easure.

532
00:51:09,513 --> 00:51:10,411
A treasur e?

533
00:51:11,749 --> 00:51:15,617
It means something to him.
He won' t say what, though.

534
00:51:15,986 --> 00:51:19,080
Look as long as you like.
I' II be downstairs.

535
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,160
Turn on the light if you want.

536
00:51:38,308 --> 00:51:43,507
It' s weir d. I f eel as if
I' ve known you f or years.

537
00:51:43,647 --> 00:51:46,013
Sometimes I really want to see you...

538
00:51:50,387 --> 00:51:53,379
You look sad today, somehow...

539
00:52:56,188 --> 00:52:57,849
Had enough?

540
00:52:57,957 --> 00:52:59,925
Yeah. Thanks.

541
00:53:00,092 --> 00:53:02,788
Ar e you making a violin?

542
00:53:03,228 --> 00:53:04,695
Uh. yeah.

543
00:53:06,365 --> 00:53:07,627
Can I see?

544
00:53:12,438 --> 00:53:13,666
It f its like this.

545
00:53:15,341 --> 00:53:17,935
You made all that? By hand?

546
00:53:18,377 --> 00:53:19,674
Sure!

547
00:53:19,778 --> 00:53:21,370
Amazing!

548
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:24,845
The shape hasn' t changed in <i>3</i>00 years.

549
00:53:24,984 --> 00:53:28,249
The sound comes fr om
the craftsman' s skill.

550
00:53:29,788 --> 00:53:31,483
You made all those?

551
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:35,592
No way! There' s a violin-making
class her e.

552
00:53:36,261 --> 00:53:38,195
But one of them is yours?

553
00:53:38,364 --> 00:53:39,296
Yeah.

554
00:53:39,898 --> 00:53:41,388
Which one?

555
00:53:41,567 --> 00:53:42,625
That one.

00:53:44,803 --> 00:53:49,763
Wow! You made this?
It' s like magic!

01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,352
Shizuku!

655
01:02:30,695 --> 01:02:32,185
You look awful!

656
01:02:32,297 --> 01:02:34,993
You sure got better f ast!

657
01:02:35,166 --> 01:02:37,930
I hear you wer e out with
a boy last night.

658
01:02:38,036 --> 01:02:40,061
Who told you that?!

659
01:02:40,171 --> 01:02:42,935
A little bir d... who said
you were like lovers.

660
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:44,303
We are not!

661
01:02:52,684 --> 01:02:56,677
<i>H</i>arada...l' II tell my f riend
the answer' s no. Sorry.

662
01:02:57,222 --> 01:02:59,690
I' m sorry, too.

663
01:03:00,191 --> 01:03:01,283
That' s OK.

664
01:03:06,064 --> 01:03:09,625
Did you see Sasuke on TV
last night? It was great!

665
01:03:17,142 --> 01:03:21,044
This f ormula will be on the mid-term,
so r emember it!

666
01:03:23,148 --> 01:03:24,046
That' s all!

667
01:03:44,836 --> 01:03:46,929
Is Tsukishima here?

668
01:03:48,006 --> 01:03:49,371
Amasawa? What do you want?

669
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:51,835
Is Tsukishima in this class?

670
01:03:52,577 --> 01:03:55,273
Tsukishima? Yeah, she' s her e.

671
01:03:55,747 --> 01:03:58,079
Tsukishima! You' ve got a visitor!

672
01:03:58,183 --> 01:03:59,047
A male!

673
01:04:03,989 --> 01:04:05,513
Ther e she is.

674
01:04:07,993 --> 01:04:09,153
Seiji?

675
01:04:09,894 --> 01:04:11,759
Can I talk to you?

676
01:04:12,631 --> 01:04:13,928
Yes!

677
01:04:14,065 --> 01:04:17,262
Tsukishima' s got a boyfriend!

678
01:04:20,505 --> 01:04:23,372
No, I don' t!

679
01:04:30,248 --> 01:04:31,840
What is it?

680
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:34,384
I' m going to Italy.

681
01:04:34,486 --> 01:04:35,384
What?

682
01:04:36,121 --> 01:04:37,315
Come with me.

683
01:04:41,626 --> 01:04:43,856
- Wher e ar e we going?
- The r oof!

684
01:04:51,503 --> 01:04:53,027
Wow!

685
01:04:53,805 --> 01:04:58,071
We can' t talk with all those
people ar ound.

686
01:04:58,410 --> 01:05:01,675
Sorry. I wanted to tell you f irst.

687
01:05:04,516 --> 01:05:07,679
<i>L</i>et them think what they want.

688
01:05:08,353 --> 01:05:11,948
My dad f inally gave in. On one condition.

689
01:05:12,624 --> 01:05:13,955
What' s that?

690
01:05:14,726 --> 01:05:19,254
I appr entice in a workshop ther e
f or two months.

691
01:05:20,165 --> 01:05:21,223
Apprentice?

692
01:05:21,399 --> 01:05:25,836
The guy who runs it' s very strict.
He' II see if I have talent or not.

693
01:05:26,438 --> 01:05:29,965
Also if I have the patience
to stick it out.

694
01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:33,208
Otherwise I go to high school.

695
01:05:33,678 --> 01:05:36,977
I hate that they' r e leaving
an escape r oute...

696
01:05:37,515 --> 01:05:38,982
...but it' s a good chance.

697
01:05:39,084 --> 01:05:40,608
When do you go?

698
01:05:41,219 --> 01:05:45,485
As soon as I get my passport.
Dad' s talking to the school today.

699
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:47,448
Soon, then...

700
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,255
Gr eat! Your dream' s coming true.

701
01:05:51,362 --> 01:05:54,388
Well, I' II do the best I can.

702
01:05:56,935 --> 01:05:58,027
- Um...
- Well...

703
01:06:00,972 --> 01:06:02,371
The rain' s stopping.

704
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:03,504
Yeah...

705
01:06:04,409 --> 01:06:06,206
Look over ther e.

706
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:13,711
Ther e might be a rainbow...

707
01:06:25,096 --> 01:06:29,692
What' s Cr emona like? I hope it' s nice.

708
01:06:30,235 --> 01:06:35,502
It' s an old town,
with lots of violin makers.

709
01:06:35,807 --> 01:06:39,641
It' s great. You' r e on your way.

710
01:06:40,245 --> 01:06:41,974
I f eel like a f ool.

711
01:06:42,313 --> 01:06:45,771
I was hoping we' d go
to the same high school...

712
01:06:46,918 --> 01:06:49,409
What a stupid thing to think...

713
01:07:07,238 --> 01:07:11,834
I saw your name on the libr ary car ds
a long time ago.

714
01:07:12,744 --> 01:07:15,770
We passed each other in the library.

715
01:07:17,081 --> 01:07:19,845
I even sat beside you ther e.

716
01:07:21,252 --> 01:07:26,690
I r ead all kinds of books so my name
would be on the car ds bef or e yours.

717
01:07:28,326 --> 01:07:29,452
I...

718
01:07:30,929 --> 01:07:34,490
I' II sing your song to myself
in Italy.

719
01:07:39,437 --> 01:07:40,734
Me, too.

720
01:07:42,941 --> 01:07:44,499
Don' t push!

721
01:07:50,915 --> 01:07:52,405
Hey!

722
01:07:54,752 --> 01:07:57,016
Look out, she' s mad!

723
01:07:59,090 --> 01:08:00,079
Run!

724
01:08:34,259 --> 01:08:35,453
- <i>H</i>er e.
- Thanks.

725
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,549
Excuse me.

726
01:08:36,661 --> 01:08:39,255
Finished alr eady?

727
01:08:40,098 --> 01:08:41,861
I' m meeting Yuko.

728
01:08:44,702 --> 01:08:47,136
If you' r e by the station, get some milk.

729
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:51,506
You' r e the one who drinks it all!

730
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:54,972
She' s slacking off these days.

731
01:09:15,133 --> 01:09:17,966
- Did I make you skip cram school?
- lt' s OK.

732
01:09:18,136 --> 01:09:19,967
My head' s in a whirl.

733
01:09:20,838 --> 01:09:22,465
Hello, Shizuku.

734
01:09:22,573 --> 01:09:23,699
Hello.

735
01:09:26,644 --> 01:09:27,906
Hi.

736
01:09:28,112 --> 01:09:29,511
Hello.

737
01:09:31,249 --> 01:09:33,649
I' II make some tea.

738
01:09:34,953 --> 01:09:38,252
Dad and I ar en' t speaking.

739
01:09:44,729 --> 01:09:47,129
Boys ar e so lucky!

740
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:54,332
When he comes back to gr aduate,
he goes again f or ten years!

741
01:09:54,439 --> 01:09:56,669
That' s like f or ever!

742
01:09:57,608 --> 01:10:01,305
But it' s like f ate
br ought you together! Cool!

743
01:10:01,512 --> 01:10:06,540
It' s too good to last.
Two people read the same books...

744
01:10:06,651 --> 01:10:10,314
...except one' s going f orwar d
while the other stays behind.

745
01:10:10,989 --> 01:10:12,388
Yeah...

746
01:10:13,057 --> 01:10:16,652
Kinuyo was in his class f or a year.

747
01:10:16,761 --> 01:10:21,323
She said he was har d to get to know,
but good-Iooking and smart.

748
01:10:21,799 --> 01:10:25,633
Don' t tell me that, will you!

749
01:10:25,803 --> 01:10:27,327
I just f eel worse!

750
01:10:27,739 --> 01:10:31,197
Why? <i>H</i>e likes you, doesn' t he?
He told you!

751
01:10:31,309 --> 01:10:33,368
Now I' m not so sur e...

752
01:10:36,547 --> 01:10:42,349
I don' t get it. I' d write every day...
we' d encour age each other...

753
01:10:43,554 --> 01:10:46,819
You can' t say 'go f or it'
to someone mor e ambitious than you.

754
01:10:47,358 --> 01:10:48,985
Maybe...

755
01:10:50,328 --> 01:10:53,820
But I don' t understand
what you want.

756
01:10:54,098 --> 01:10:57,226
Can' t you be in love without
your f utur e planned out?

757
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:01,729
You have talent.

758
01:11:01,839 --> 01:11:05,434
All the juniors liked
your translation of 'Country Roads' .

759
01:11:06,144 --> 01:11:09,341
You can expr ess yourself, too...
unlike me.

760
01:11:11,716 --> 01:11:14,048
'There' s lots as good as me' .

761
01:11:14,552 --> 01:11:16,520
That' s what he said.

762
01:11:16,621 --> 01:11:20,557
<i>H</i>e' s going to f ind out if he has talent.
Well, so will I!

763
01:11:23,194 --> 01:11:25,719
I' II write a story!

764
01:11:25,963 --> 01:11:29,490
There' s one I want to write.
If he can do it, so can I.

765
01:11:30,768 --> 01:11:32,201
But it' s exam time...

766
01:11:32,303 --> 01:11:36,364
I don' t car e. Thanks, Yuko.
I f eel empower ed.

767
01:11:36,841 --> 01:11:38,274
- You going?
- Yeah.

768
01:11:42,213 --> 01:11:43,441
Good night.

769
01:11:44,015 --> 01:11:45,846
Tell your mother hello.

770
01:11:49,654 --> 01:11:51,087
You go f or it, too.

771
01:11:52,723 --> 01:11:56,591
Sugimura will realize.

772
01:11:57,428 --> 01:11:58,417
'Bye.

773
01:12:00,431 --> 01:12:04,390
It' s so easy! I just have to
do something. too!

774
01:12:08,473 --> 01:12:09,633
Moon?

775
01:12:12,877 --> 01:12:15,175
Muta?

776
01:12:15,813 --> 01:12:19,044
Mom! Muta' s gone again!

777
01:12:19,417 --> 01:12:20,679
Muta!

778
01:12:21,619 --> 01:12:22,916
'Muta' ...

779
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:31,460
<i>'Whi</i>s<i>per o</i>f <i>the Heart':</i>
<i>Listen to the voice of the woods</i>...

780
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:58,916
The Baron as the hero?

781
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:01,387
Would you mind?

782
01:13:01,859 --> 01:13:06,728
I ask because Seiji says
the doll is a treasur e of yours...

783
01:13:08,299 --> 01:13:09,926
You didn' t have to ask!

784
01:13:10,635 --> 01:13:14,162
Of course you can.
But on one condition.

785
01:13:15,706 --> 01:13:16,434
Yes?

786
01:13:16,908 --> 01:13:21,675
That you let me be the f irst person
to r ead your story.

787
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,972
Um...

788
01:13:24,582 --> 01:13:26,049
All right?

789
01:13:26,284 --> 01:13:31,187
Do I have to? I don' t know
if I can write it or not...

790
01:13:34,158 --> 01:13:36,991
It' s the same f or a craftsman.

791
01:13:37,094 --> 01:13:40,393
Don' t expect perf ection at f irst.

792
01:13:40,798 --> 01:13:43,266
Here, let me show you something.

793
01:13:49,974 --> 01:13:51,305
This.

794
01:13:55,513 --> 01:13:56,605
Look at it.

795
01:14:05,122 --> 01:14:07,590
It' s called <i>'</i>mica slate' .

796
01:14:07,758 --> 01:14:10,022
Look at the seam.

797
01:14:10,528 --> 01:14:12,257
Like that...

798
01:14:23,207 --> 01:14:24,572
It' s beautif ul!

799
01:14:25,009 --> 01:14:29,810
It' s called <i>'</i>beryl' .
You f ind it in emerald ore.

800
01:14:30,281 --> 01:14:32,181
Emerald? The jewel?

801
01:14:32,283 --> 01:14:33,045
Yes.

802
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:36,709
You and Seiji are like this stone.

803
01:14:37,088 --> 01:14:40,080
Rough, unpolished, still natural.

804
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:43,526
I like stones that way.

805
01:14:43,794 --> 01:14:48,527
But making violins, or writing stories,
is dif f er ent.

806
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:54,062
The r ough stone is inside you.
You have to f ind it and then polish it.

807
01:14:54,672 --> 01:14:56,071
It takes time and ef f ort.

808
01:14:57,308 --> 01:15:00,744
You see the or e that makes up
most of that stone?

809
01:15:01,345 --> 01:15:02,073
Yes.

810
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:07,540
You could polish that,
but what you' d get would be worthless.

811
01:15:08,019 --> 01:15:11,284
The smaller part inside is pur er.

812
01:15:11,856 --> 01:15:16,725
Ther e might even be a better stone
deep inside wher e we can' t see.

813
01:15:17,194 --> 01:15:21,290
I' m sorry. Old people
like to preach.

814
01:15:23,367 --> 01:15:27,599
I' m scar ed. What if ther e isn' t
a beautiful crystal in me?

815
01:15:28,372 --> 01:15:32,308
But I want to write. And you' II be
the first one to see it.

816
01:15:32,576 --> 01:15:35,443
Thank you. I' II look f orward to it.

817
01:15:43,988 --> 01:15:47,651
A rough stone...lapis lazuli...

818
01:15:51,929 --> 01:15:54,227
Let us go f orth together...

819
01:15:54,765 --> 01:15:57,495
...in sear ch of the tr easur e
of lapis lazuli!

820
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:03,372
<i>H</i>ave no f ear. Space is def ormed
on the night of the new moon.

821
01:16:06,977 --> 01:16:10,743
Far away things loom large,
nearby things look small.

822
01:16:14,185 --> 01:16:16,847
Fly! We will rise on the updraf t.

823
01:16:22,927 --> 01:16:26,294
Make haste! The planetoids converge!

824
01:16:38,809 --> 01:16:40,868
Good! We' r e riding the wind!

825
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:44,348
Straight up to that castle!

826
01:16:45,082 --> 01:16:46,606
It' s so high!

827
01:16:46,717 --> 01:16:49,447
It' s not so high once you' r e there!

828
01:17:08,439 --> 01:17:13,342
When the air curr ents mingle
in the afternoon, you can touch the stars!

829
01:17:15,379 --> 01:17:16,141
Huh?

830
01:17:20,518 --> 01:17:25,319
That' s r ar e! Shizuku looking at
non-f iction...

831
01:18:04,528 --> 01:18:07,622
He' s making a violin in his cell...

832
01:18:40,664 --> 01:18:41,995
Seiji!

833
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,098
I thought you' d gone!

834
01:18:45,269 --> 01:18:48,102
Grandpa said I might f ind you her e.

835
01:18:49,373 --> 01:18:51,933
I leave tomorrow.

836
01:18:52,576 --> 01:18:53,770
Tomorrow...

837
01:18:55,813 --> 01:18:59,977
Don' t worry. I' II wait her e
till you' r e done.

838
01:19:26,610 --> 01:19:28,510
Sorry I can' t walk you home.

839
01:19:28,846 --> 01:19:31,713
That' s OK. I' m glad you came.

840
01:19:32,449 --> 01:19:35,418
I can' t come to the airport,
but I' II wait f or you.

841
01:19:35,519 --> 01:19:37,612
Yeah. It' s only two months.

842
01:19:44,495 --> 01:19:50,092
I' m sorry I' m always so depr essing.
I' II do my best while you' r e gone.

843
01:19:57,841 --> 01:19:59,468
I' II see you, then.

844
01:20:02,313 --> 01:20:04,508
Have a good trip!

845
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:27,797
I and Luisa, my betr othed,
wer e born in a distant land.

846
01:20:32,576 --> 01:20:35,409
In that town, magic still lived...

847
01:20:36,013 --> 01:20:40,712
...and in the veins of its artisans
flowed the blood of sor cer ers.

848
01:20:47,124 --> 01:20:51,754
It was a poor doll-maker' s appr entice
who f ashioned us...

849
01:20:53,931 --> 01:20:58,027
...but Luisa and I were happy...

850
01:20:59,203 --> 01:21:02,070
...because he had made us
so we could love others.

851
01:21:03,641 --> 01:21:04,767
But then...

852
01:21:11,715 --> 01:21:12,807
Shizuku!

853
01:21:13,384 --> 01:21:14,476
Shizuku!

854
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,446
Shizuku!

855
01:21:20,057 --> 01:21:23,026
What' s going on? Tsukishima!

856
01:21:24,428 --> 01:21:26,794
I' m sorry. I wasn' t listening.

857
01:21:26,897 --> 01:21:29,491
Pay attention! This is important!

858
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,624
Sorry, sir.

859
01:21:30,734 --> 01:21:32,599
Harada, you read.

860
01:21:35,606 --> 01:21:38,302
You wer e up until 4 again?!

861
01:21:38,409 --> 01:21:41,003
It' s OK. I' m not sleepy at all.

862
01:21:41,145 --> 01:21:46,139
But you' r e spaced out all the time!
Like just now...

863
01:21:46,316 --> 01:21:50,616
I was thinking. I' ve got to organize
what I want to write.

864
01:21:52,923 --> 01:21:54,823
I' m not hungry.

865
01:22:23,253 --> 01:22:26,017
Shizuku? So you are home...

866
01:22:26,724 --> 01:22:28,783
Turn on the lights!

867
01:22:29,293 --> 01:22:32,785
At least you could bring in
the laundry!

868
01:22:33,363 --> 01:22:36,264
Shizuku! Come here!

869
01:22:39,136 --> 01:22:41,604
Shizuku' s her e, isn' t she?

870
01:22:42,072 --> 01:22:43,630
She' s not hungry.

871
01:23:08,298 --> 01:23:11,529
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Sorry to trouble you.

872
01:23:11,635 --> 01:23:15,162
This way...is anyone in
the guidance off ice?

873
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:17,704
Please.

874
01:23:24,047 --> 01:23:25,344
I' m back!

875
01:23:28,685 --> 01:23:29,947
Hello.

876
01:23:30,687 --> 01:23:32,552
You' r e home early, Shiho.

877
01:23:34,124 --> 01:23:36,456
I' m beat!

878
01:23:36,693 --> 01:23:37,751
Want some coff ee?

879
01:23:37,861 --> 01:23:39,021
Yes, please.

880
01:23:41,832 --> 01:23:44,801
Mom, can I talk to you?

881
01:23:45,068 --> 01:23:46,057
What?

882
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:53,741
I' m thinking of moving out.

883
01:23:54,645 --> 01:23:56,112
I' ve f ound a place.

884
01:23:56,213 --> 01:23:58,204
But can you aff or d it?

885
01:23:58,715 --> 01:24:00,842
I' ve saved from my job.

886
01:24:01,218 --> 01:24:04,483
I f ound another one
at a cram school. I' II get by.

887
01:24:05,489 --> 01:24:09,323
I guess I' ve made you help me out
too much around her e.

888
01:24:09,893 --> 01:24:12,191
I' II talk to your f ather.

889
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:15,091
You will? Great!

890
01:24:17,334 --> 01:24:21,361
Money' s tight till I graduate
in the spring and get working...

891
01:24:21,538 --> 01:24:23,199
...but I' II help you out then.

892
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:25,207
Sounds good.

893
01:24:25,709 --> 01:24:28,439
Sorry to go during
your master' s thesis...

894
01:24:28,545 --> 01:24:29,739
Thanks.

895
01:24:30,347 --> 01:24:33,839
You helped enough just with
sorting out data.

896
01:24:34,284 --> 01:24:39,620
And Shizuku can concentrate
in her own r oom. She' s acting weird.

897
01:24:39,790 --> 01:24:41,451
You think so too?

898
01:24:42,492 --> 01:24:45,484
The school called me. Look at this.

899
01:24:46,296 --> 01:24:47,661
What is it?

900
01:24:48,832 --> 01:24:51,733
She' s gone down a hundr ed places!

901
01:24:53,136 --> 01:24:57,163
She' s at her desk all the time...
what' s she doing?

902
01:25:05,515 --> 01:25:06,413
Good evening.

903
01:25:06,516 --> 01:25:08,108
Hello.

904
01:25:10,487 --> 01:25:11,818
Excuse me.

905
01:25:17,427 --> 01:25:20,885
What high school will take you
with marks like this?!

906
01:25:20,998 --> 01:25:23,159
I' m not going to high school!

907
01:25:23,467 --> 01:25:29,064
Use your head! What can you do
with a middle-school education?

908
01:25:29,539 --> 01:25:31,666
I can decide my own future!

909
01:25:32,142 --> 01:25:33,404
Watch your mouth!

910
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:38,140
Face the f acts! The school makes
its r eport on you after the second term!

911
01:25:38,248 --> 01:25:40,182
You' re a f ine one to talk!

912
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:43,542
You don' t study!
You just work part-time!

913
01:25:43,654 --> 01:25:45,986
I do what I have to!

914
01:25:46,556 --> 01:25:50,822
You' r e the one who isn' t doing that!
Don' t you understand?

915
01:25:51,395 --> 01:25:54,694
I' ve got something mor e important to do!

916
01:25:55,132 --> 01:25:58,101
Like what? Tell me.

917
01:25:59,503 --> 01:26:02,404
Shiho, Shizuku...that' s enough.

918
01:26:02,506 --> 01:26:05,703
But Oad...listen to this girl!

919
01:26:06,043 --> 01:26:09,501
Both of you come out her e
and tell me about it.

920
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:12,342
Shizuku, change out of your unif orm.

921
01:26:14,718 --> 01:26:15,946
Come on.

922
01:26:29,967 --> 01:26:33,903
I see. Is it true what Shiho says?

923
01:26:34,004 --> 01:26:36,234
I do so car e about my marks!

924
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:38,774
You just said you wer en' t going
to high school.

925
01:26:38,875 --> 01:26:41,605
You said I wouldn' t get into one!

926
01:26:41,712 --> 01:26:46,206
Shiho...can Shizuku and I talk
alone f or a bit?

927
01:26:46,316 --> 01:26:47,180
Yes.

928
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:51,116
Where' s your mother?

929
01:26:51,221 --> 01:26:52,620
At the Tanakas.

930
01:26:53,323 --> 01:26:54,153
I' m back.

931
01:26:54,257 --> 01:26:56,225
Hi, Mom.

932
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:57,725
Is your dad back?

933
01:26:58,695 --> 01:27:02,961
Could you come her e, Asako?
I' ve been hearing about Shizuku.

934
01:27:03,066 --> 01:27:04,226
Coming.

935
01:27:10,207 --> 01:27:12,107
All right, Shizuku...

936
01:27:14,044 --> 01:27:18,105
Is what you' r e doing now
more important than studying?

937
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:22,775
Can you tell me what it is?

938
01:27:23,754 --> 01:27:25,619
When it' s time.

939
01:27:26,123 --> 01:27:29,957
Is this something you have to do
right away?

940
01:27:30,394 --> 01:27:33,761
I' ve only got thr ee weeks lef t
to do it!

941
01:27:34,331 --> 01:27:37,664
I' m testing myself.

942
01:27:38,001 --> 01:27:38,968
I have to.

943
01:27:39,436 --> 01:27:42,428
Testing yourself? How?

944
01:27:44,641 --> 01:27:46,700
How will we know if you don' t say?

945
01:27:48,812 --> 01:27:51,576
Is it something you can' t even
tell us?

946
01:27:53,116 --> 01:27:54,048
Seiya!

947
01:27:54,151 --> 01:27:56,142
Oh...sorry.

948
01:28:05,896 --> 01:28:12,392
Whatever you' r e doing at the library,
I admire how har d you' r e working.

949
01:28:13,503 --> 01:28:16,597
Let' s let her do what she wants.

950
01:28:17,607 --> 01:28:20,337
Not everyone has to be the same.

951
01:28:21,978 --> 01:28:26,506
I should know that
if anyone does...

952
01:28:27,918 --> 01:28:31,410
OK, Shizuku, do what you believe in.

953
01:28:32,422 --> 01:28:36,324
But it' s not easy
when you walk your own road.

954
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:39,720
You' ve only got yourself to blame.

955
01:28:41,698 --> 01:28:44,758
And join us at mealtimes, all right?

956
01:28:44,868 --> 01:28:46,768
Yeah. We' re a f amily.

957
01:28:46,870 --> 01:28:47,837
Yes.

958
01:28:48,305 --> 01:28:49,897
Call Shiho.

959
01:28:53,076 --> 01:28:54,304
I' II make some tea.

960
01:28:57,547 --> 01:28:58,639
Shizuku...

961
01:29:00,484 --> 01:29:04,887
I know what Dad said, but what
he r eally wants is f or you to study.

962
01:29:05,255 --> 01:29:07,849
I know. It' s written on his f ace.

963
01:29:08,325 --> 01:29:11,624
I' m moving out next Sunday.

964
01:29:12,429 --> 01:29:13,896
You' II have your own r oom.

965
01:29:14,331 --> 01:29:16,026
You' r e leaving home?

966
01:29:16,133 --> 01:29:18,260
Yep. So smarten up!

967
01:29:29,412 --> 01:29:30,276
Hurry!

968
01:29:31,014 --> 01:29:32,777
Hurry!

969
01:29:34,284 --> 01:29:36,616
Only the one is real.

970
01:29:37,053 --> 01:29:39,351
Which is the real one?!

971
01:29:39,456 --> 01:29:40,320
Hurry!

972
01:29:40,957 --> 01:29:41,855
Hurry!

973
01:29:43,193 --> 01:29:44,160
Hurry!

974
01:31:23,126 --> 01:31:28,257
Luisa... you' ve f inally come...
but I' ve gr own so old...

975
01:31:55,091 --> 01:31:56,422
Shizuku...

976
01:31:56,526 --> 01:32:00,690
Come in...I was f ast asleep.

977
01:32:02,032 --> 01:32:06,765
I' m sorry to bother you.
I' ve brought my story.

978
01:32:10,407 --> 01:32:13,205
It' s f inished?

979
01:32:15,211 --> 01:32:18,703
You pr omised you' d be
the f irst to r ead it.

980
01:32:18,848 --> 01:32:20,782
It' s a novel!

981
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:24,477
'<i>Whisper of the Heart'</i>

982
01:32:24,921 --> 01:32:29,415
Can you r ead it now?
I' II wait as long as it takes.

983
01:32:29,859 --> 01:32:34,990
But you' ve worked so har d on it...
shouldn' t I take my time?

984
01:32:35,365 --> 01:32:40,530
You can stop if you don' t like it.
I hate to ask, but...

985
01:32:41,638 --> 01:32:43,868
My heart' s pounding...

986
01:32:44,474 --> 01:32:47,170
I see. I' II r ead it right now.

987
01:32:47,277 --> 01:32:50,371
Come sit by the f ire. It' s cold.

988
01:32:55,585 --> 01:32:57,985
Now we won' t be bother ed.

989
01:33:02,425 --> 01:33:05,485
Can I wait downstairs?

990
01:33:06,663 --> 01:33:08,824
It' s OK. I' m not cold at all.

991
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:14,331
Of course...but...

992
01:34:27,444 --> 01:34:29,207
You' re asleep her e?

993
01:34:29,446 --> 01:34:31,641
Shizuku...l' m f inished.

994
01:34:34,117 --> 01:34:36,449
Thank you. It' s very good.

995
01:34:36,553 --> 01:34:38,180
It' s not!

996
01:34:38,588 --> 01:34:42,080
Say what you r eally think!
I couldn' t write what I wanted!

997
01:34:42,559 --> 01:34:45,687
The last half doesn' t make sense.
I know that!

998
01:34:45,995 --> 01:34:49,988
Yes...it' s rough. blunt, unf inished...

999
01:34:50,166 --> 01:34:52,327
...just like Seiji' s violin.

1000
01:34:54,971 --> 01:35:00,204
You' ve shown me the rough stone
you' ve just cut out of the rock.

1001
01:35:01,144 --> 01:35:04,580
You' ve worked har d.
You' re wonderful.

1002
01:35:06,182 --> 01:35:10,482
There' s no need to rush now.
Take your time and polish it.

1003
01:35:35,411 --> 01:35:38,574
It' s cold out here. Come inside.

1004
01:35:38,715 --> 01:35:39,773
Now...

1005
01:35:40,383 --> 01:35:43,284
...now I' ve written it I know.

1006
01:35:44,053 --> 01:35:46,214
Wanting isn' t enough.

1007
01:35:46,756 --> 01:35:49,316
I have to learn mor e...

1008
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:54,496
... but Seiji' s getting
further and further ahead.

1009
01:35:55,064 --> 01:35:59,797
I f elt that I had to f or ce myself
to write, and I was so scared...

1010
01:36:02,272 --> 01:36:04,763
You like Seiji, do you?

1011
01:36:25,828 --> 01:36:27,455
How is it?

1012
01:36:28,665 --> 01:36:29,825
It' s very good.

1013
01:36:31,601 --> 01:36:36,732
When Seiji f inished his f irst violin,
we had <i>ramen</i> noodles.

1014
01:36:36,906 --> 01:36:39,136
Jumbo size.

1015
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:45,604
Thank you.

1016
01:36:47,517 --> 01:36:50,247
Now, where was I?

1017
01:36:50,453 --> 01:36:53,684
You f ound the Bar on
in a cof f ee-shop...

1018
01:36:54,624 --> 01:36:55,591
Yes, in Germany...

1019
01:36:57,427 --> 01:37:01,659
I was a student.
He looked so melancholic...

1020
01:37:01,831 --> 01:37:04,766
I asked the owner
to sell him to me.

1021
01:37:06,135 --> 01:37:07,727
But he wouldn' t.

1022
01:37:07,904 --> 01:37:12,864
The Bar on had a lover, and
he wouldn' t separate them.

1023
01:37:14,344 --> 01:37:19,714
<i>H</i>e was waiting f or her to come back
from being repaired...

1024
01:37:19,882 --> 01:37:21,850
...at the doll-maker' s shop.

1025
01:37:22,685 --> 01:37:26,018
Just like in my story!

1026
01:37:26,522 --> 01:37:29,491
Yes... quite the coincidence!

1027
01:37:29,759 --> 01:37:33,820
I had to come home,
so I' d just about given up.

1028
01:37:34,397 --> 01:37:38,060
Then a lady friend of mine...

1029
01:37:38,968 --> 01:37:42,369
...said when the other doll came back
she would take it...

1030
01:37:42,472 --> 01:37:45,339
...and bring the two dolls together.

1031
01:37:45,441 --> 01:37:47,966
So the owner gave in.

1032
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:52,378
So I ended up leaving Germany
with just the Baron.

1033
01:37:52,482 --> 01:37:58,910
I pr omised her I' d come back,
and asked her to keep the other doll.

1034
01:38:00,289 --> 01:38:03,417
The day the dolls met again...

1035
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:07,291
...would be the day we did.

1036
01:38:08,998 --> 01:38:14,129
But then the war started,
and I couldn' t keep my promise.

1037
01:38:16,039 --> 01:38:20,999
When I was f inally able to go back,
I looked all over f or her.

1038
01:38:22,111 --> 01:38:27,242
But ther e was no tr ace of her,
or the Baron' s lover.

1039
01:38:28,618 --> 01:38:32,019
She must have been
very important to you...

1040
01:38:32,355 --> 01:38:39,227
Your story brought the Baron out of
my memory and back to lif e.

1041
01:38:39,328 --> 01:38:41,125
Oh. yes...

1042
01:38:49,439 --> 01:38:51,464
Hold out your hand.

1043
01:38:57,914 --> 01:38:58,812
But...

1044
01:38:58,948 --> 01:39:03,317
That stone suits you perf ectly.
I' II give it to you.

1045
01:39:04,087 --> 01:39:07,853
Now. finish up your story.

1046
01:39:07,957 --> 01:39:08,821
Yes.

1047
01:39:24,574 --> 01:39:26,132
Thank you!

1048
01:39:30,246 --> 01:39:31,679
Goodbye!

1049
01:39:42,058 --> 01:39:43,116
I' m home.

1050
01:39:43,726 --> 01:39:44,920
Hi.

1051
01:39:47,663 --> 01:39:48,891
Where' s Oad?

1052
01:39:49,398 --> 01:39:52,993
In the bath. Wher e have you been
till this hour?

1053
01:39:53,136 --> 01:39:58,768
I' m sorry I worried you. Today I r eturn
to studying f or my entrance exams.

1054
01:39:59,242 --> 01:40:01,767
So your trials ar e over?

1055
01:40:02,178 --> 01:40:03,577
For now.

1056
01:40:05,681 --> 01:40:07,979
Oid you eat? There' s curry...

1057
01:40:08,084 --> 01:40:09,016
I' m f ine!

1058
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:12,544
'For now' ...

1059
01:40:22,732 --> 01:40:25,132
Shizuku, the bath' s open.

1060
01:40:44,987 --> 01:40:46,921
Ah, a soldier at ease.

1061
01:41:53,656 --> 01:41:54,850
No!

1062
01:42:02,865 --> 01:42:04,457
Wait ther e!

1063
01:42:19,815 --> 01:42:21,942
It' s a miracle! You' r e her e!

1064
01:42:22,084 --> 01:42:23,608
We' re not dr eaming?

1065
01:42:23,819 --> 01:42:26,845
I got an earlier plane. Hop on.

1066
01:42:27,556 --> 01:42:30,684
Wait...you' II be cold.

1067
01:42:33,429 --> 01:42:34,487
Climb on.

1068
01:42:35,831 --> 01:42:37,093
I' II get a coat.

1069
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:39,326
No time! Get on.

1070
01:42:41,737 --> 01:42:43,261
Hang on tight.

1071
01:42:48,878 --> 01:42:52,746
I was out ther e calling you
in my head.

1072
01:42:52,848 --> 01:42:54,281
'Shizuku!'

1073
01:42:54,517 --> 01:42:57,645
And then you appeared!

1074
01:42:58,187 --> 01:42:59,279
What a team!

1075
01:43:00,823 --> 01:43:04,350
Me, too... it' s like I' m still dr eaming!

1076
01:43:10,333 --> 01:43:11,994
How was Cr emona?

1077
01:43:12,301 --> 01:43:15,793
A lot diff er ent than I thought.
But I' m going to do it.

1078
01:43:16,806 --> 01:43:17,898
It' s getting light!

1079
01:43:27,183 --> 01:43:28,275
Shall I get of f?

1080
01:43:28,384 --> 01:43:29,442
It' s OK.

1081
01:43:30,519 --> 01:43:35,684
I made up my mind I was going to
ride you up this hill!

1082
01:43:35,791 --> 01:43:37,452
That' s not f air!

1083
01:43:40,262 --> 01:43:42,628
I' m no man' s bur den!

1084
01:43:45,835 --> 01:43:49,134
I want to be of use!

1085
01:43:50,306 --> 01:43:52,365
OK! Push!

1086
01:43:53,142 --> 01:43:54,200
Almost ther e!

1087
01:44:08,758 --> 01:44:11,659
Shizuku! Jump on!

1088
01:44:30,012 --> 01:44:31,138
We made it!

1089
01:44:36,152 --> 01:44:38,177
- I' II hold the coat.
- It' s OK.

1090
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:42,622
Here...

1091
01:44:59,809 --> 01:45:03,472
Wow! In the mist it looks
just like the sea!

1092
01:45:03,646 --> 01:45:07,446
This is my secr et place.
It' s almost time.

1093
01:45:52,461 --> 01:45:54,725
I wanted you to see this.

1094
01:45:58,134 --> 01:46:00,864
Grandpa told me everything.

1095
01:46:01,070 --> 01:46:05,666
I didn' t do anything to help...
I was just thinking of myself.

1096
01:46:05,808 --> 01:46:08,936
No...you were the reason I did it.

1097
01:46:09,812 --> 01:46:14,579
I' m glad I pushed myself.
I understand myself better now.

1098
01:46:15,217 --> 01:46:20,280
I' m going to study har d
and go on to high school.

1099
01:46:20,389 --> 01:46:22,914
Listen, Shizuku...

1100
01:46:24,193 --> 01:46:27,754
... I can' t say how soon it' II be, but...

1101
01:46:28,564 --> 01:46:30,498
...would you marry me?

1102
01:46:31,867 --> 01:46:36,304
I' m going to be a violin maker...
and then...

1103
01:46:41,610 --> 01:46:42,634
You mean it?

1104
01:46:42,745 --> 01:46:45,908
That' s exactly what I wanted.

1105
01:46:46,215 --> 01:46:48,206
Yeah? Gr eat!

1106
01:46:48,684 --> 01:46:51,744
Wait...it' s cold...

1107
01:46:52,588 --> 01:46:55,113
Shizuku...I love you!
