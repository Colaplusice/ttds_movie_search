{689}{765}Who's dealing, you or me?
{779}{813}Me.

{1184}{1234}Rotten hand.
{1238}{1274}You're playing funny.
{1278}{1364}You don't want...? Don't get mad.
{1369}{1418}I was only asking.
{1422}{1486}How many cards do you want?|Three?
{2285}{2333}Are you going to give me a break?
{2337}{2377}I have a bad hand.
{2381}{2463}Wait till you see what I'm going to do.|Moron.
{2468}{2509}This will be my victory.
{2657}{2699}Daddy.
{2736}{2794}Did you see how brilliant...?
{2798}{2870}Show your hand...|Don't get mad.
{3028}{3083}You, don't interrupt me...
{3087}{3130}...or you'll be sorry.
{3134}{3212}When I get married,|buy me a truck like that.
{3216}{3301}I take two.|And you? None? Great.
{3351}{3405}Two for me.
{3422}{3519}Lovely hand. Three Aces.|-Swanker.
{3524}{3578}Promise, when I get married.
{3582}{3634}Four Sevens.
{3640}{3677}Look, how lovely.
{3681}{3742}Screw your "lovely".
{3752}{3806}Daddy, look.
{3832}{3946}I told you, don't interrupt|when I'm playing cards.
{4110}{4184}Daddy likes you,|but you're troubling him.
{4666}{4777}Cards are like whores.
{4781}{4821}Fickle.
{4874}{4929}Who do you think I am?
{4935}{4982}I can bluff.
{5788}{5872}Maxim Gorki is here. The Russians.
{6011}{6121}Look at this. Poker.
{6129}{6180}Maradona.
{6405}{6536}Hurry up, Zare.|-Give my eggs back.
{8061}{8138}How much for the horns, comrade?
{8206}{8240}Ten marks.
{8365}{8424}Come on, five marks.
{8432}{8467}No way. Ten.
{8472}{8557}What do you want with it?|-Silence. Simpleton.
{8562}{8611}It is secondhand raw material.|One for five marks.
{8619}{8678}One million horns, five million marks.
{8684}{8718}Sure.
{8722}{8814}How much for the washing machine?|-300 marks.
{8870}{8945}Fine machine. Very good.
{8951}{9014}I'll make you an excellent offer.
{9018}{9129}220 marks for the horns,|the washing machine and the computer.
{9135}{9199}No way. 280.|-250.
{9226}{9280}Sold.|-Shake hands.
{9395}{9456}Can I help?|-It's all right.
{9809}{9843}On that side.
{10376}{10412}Daddy.
{10416}{10461}We've been swindled.
{10837}{10874}Have a look.
{10915}{10968}The Russians trade water for Diesel.
{11050}{11085}What?
{11090}{11162}Water. Have a look.
{11623}{11659}100 percent Diesel.
{11790}{11856}Water.|-The barrel is full of water.
{11860}{11915}The whole barrel?
{12008}{12181}The cold rain falls at dawn.
{12256}{12299}I don't understand.
{12303}{12383}Why is she wearing spy-glasses|and a grater?
{12388}{12465}Some small change|for the baby she's expecting.
{12474}{12527}For the surgery.
{12579}{12644}Grandma expresses her gratitude.
{12649}{12747}-What?|It will be two, according to the echo.
{12751}{12822}Piss off, bloody gipsy.
{13388}{13429}The gate, the gate.
{13809}{13844}Halt, who goes there?
{13887}{13959}Hello.|-Who are you?
{13963}{14020}Matko Destanov.|-Hands up.
{14089}{14124}Hands up.
{14128}{14164}Goose, over.
{14298}{14388}I was planning to|go to Hungary tonight.
{14392}{14458}To the fair in Pecs.
{14487}{14601}Go to the fair wherever you like,|but don't return without a fiance.
{14605}{14651}Understood?
{14655}{14722}Hello, mister Grga, boss.
{14752}{14809}Little bird, why have you returned?
{14815}{14869}I've never been here.
{14994}{15078}Yes you have, five years ago.|-Me? No.
{15083}{15187}Don't contradict me.|-We saw each other, but not here.
{15192}{15256}Someone important relocates often.
{15261}{15344}Eight years ago then.|-Eight? That's impossible.
{15415}{15452}O yes, yes.
{15458}{15557}My compliments, uncle Grga.
{15694}{15756}Look at me.|-I am looking at you.
{15761}{15837}Why are you here? And don't tell lies.
{15843}{15918}I would do anything for your father.
{15923}{15985}He saved my life twice.
{15990}{16089}In Genova, and in Marseille.|-I know.
{16094}{16190}He beat up half the city...
{16195}{16246}...to get me out of jail.
{16251}{16310}He is a gentlemen.
{16340}{16414}Was. May the Lord have mercy on his soul.
{16445}{16549}On whose soul?|-My father's. Last year.
{16604}{16684}One day I was doing all right, the|next day I was an orphan.
{16689}{16729}Without any help.
{16734}{16771}Lost and lonely.
{16777}{16851}No one can help me.
{16856}{17005}You were his downfall.|A swindler, a rotter, gambler, vagabond.
{17010}{17064}That was temporary.
{17069}{17137}Making mistakes is human. I have changed.
{17143}{17209}I've learned my lesson.
{17215}{17294}Uncle Grga, I've got a brilliant plan.
{17299}{17357}What kinda plan?|-A train.
{17363}{17424}A train with 20 wagon-loads of gasoline.
{17429}{17487}Gasoline?|What use is that going to be to me?
{17513}{17591}Since the death of my father...
{17596}{17660}...I don't get anybodies help.
{17665}{17742}That's business for the pros.
{17746}{17831}They'll screw you.|You're a freshman.
{17836}{17951}No, Uncle Grga. I've got it all|covered this time. It'll be all right.
{18047}{18118}I've got it on paper.
{18165}{18206}I'll show you the fax.
{18280}{18332}Don't come back without a wife.
{18338}{18387}Are you up to something again?
{18392}{18441}Laugh, dammit.
{18523}{18617}I received an urgent fax.|Everything's in there.
{18669}{18714}All the details.
{18963}{18999}Birdy.
{19046}{19084}Come here.
{19222}{19340}Goose, over... Reply.
{19379}{19426}Look, uncle Grga.
{19432}{19516}Everything's in the fax.
{19561}{19626}We invest 70.000 marks...
{19673}{19709}What, boss?
{19714}{19817}Goose, the laborers can go.|And you too.
{19823}{19866}All right, boss.
{19871}{19908}Let's have a break.
{19952}{20053}I want to loan 70.000 and within a|week I'll return you 100.000.
{20219}{20269}Did you see that?
{20274}{20334}I see it, uncle Grga.
{20400}{20474}You sure have a lot of money.
{20626}{20705}I'm only doing this for your father.
{20710}{20784}You won't have to pay me back...
{20789}{20887}...but I do want a full report|of your lucrative deal.
{20891}{21045}If not I'll send my grandsons|to skin you alive.
{21050}{21129}Am I making myself clear?|-Very clear.
{21366}{21471}Weirdo.|-Millions. Maradona.
{21504}{21543}You said your granddad died.
{21547}{21619}He's in a hospital,|that's practically the same.
{21624}{21751}He has a large cement factory|and never gave me a penny.
{21796}{21882}Zare, my son. With this money|your daddy will buy you a future...
{21887}{21941}...and your children's future.
{21950}{22019}Leave me be.|I'll never forgive you.
{22533}{22577}Zare.
{22773}{22843}Take a look at this miracle.
{23118}{23166}Now that's what I call an invention.
{23172}{23249}Only the Germans can|invent something like that.
{23380}{23419}Daddy makes a promise to you...
{23423}{23524}Boy, when I'm rich,|I'll make a ship-owner out of you.
{24323}{24359}Dadi.
{24526}{24587}There's our benefactor.
{25226}{25297}Pitbull.|Terrier.
{25553}{25618}Fortune favors the bold.
{25625}{25724}Ungrateful bastard. I give you something to|eat and that's your way of saying thank you?
{25757}{25795}It's all in the game.
{25973}{26034}Welcome, Dadi, my dear brother.|-Who is he?
{26039}{26129}What the fuck do you care?|-I was only asking.
{26319}{26362}So there's a God after all.
{26398}{26451}Is there anything to see?
{26456}{26517}Unlucky person. Read this.
{26527}{26573}You wanted to see me.
{26591}{26661}I don't wanna work with thieves anymore.
{26665}{26773}What are you waiting for?|Give the man something to drink.
{26903}{26975}I've got a cunning plan.|-You?
{26981}{27037}Honderd percent failsafe.
{27070}{27120}It's the plan of the century.
{27147}{27207}I've got a connection in Jordan.
{27212}{27266}He sells me a train full of gasoline.
{27272}{27374}Brilliant. A stroke of luck.|-Well just buy it.
{27521}{27559}I don't have the money.
{27646}{27746}That's why I need you.|You know the custom-house officers.
{27751}{27803}You don't need to know the|custom-house officers.
{27808}{27919}The Bulgarians always say: "Brother, if you|can't solve a problem with money...
{27924}{27992}...solve it with a lot of money."
{28075}{28109}Have a drink.
{28189}{28223}What is it?
{28294}{28341}Whisky in a gin-glass?
{28347}{28420}You don't like gypsies?|Get lost, bitch.
{28425}{28460}Get lost all of you.
{28465}{28546}Fuck you all. You too, out.|You choose her side.
{28558}{28601}No.|-He's lying.
{28606}{28700}Forget it.|-Piss off.
{28742}{28780}Suckers.
{28826}{28877}I'm not a racist.
{28929}{29018}Huh, Matko?|-You have always been tolerant.
{29023}{29094}I've known you since you were little.|-Sorry.
{29100}{29148}I'll drink from the bottle.
{29154}{29213}No way. Cheers.
{29218}{29271}On our deal.
{29432}{29485}Ain't he cute?
{29601}{29644}He's old enough to get married.
{29648}{29735}Zare? He's not of age, but he is mature.
{29741}{29838}Is he honest?|-One hunderd percent. That's what counts.
{29878}{29950}Lucky you. You live like a man.
{29955}{30047}Not like me, with that scum.
{30052}{30157}Motherfucking junkies.|Don't you dare that again.
{30250}{30366}Stop whining.|Apparently you're not short on anything.
{30373}{30442}What's that to me? Tell me.
{30448}{30501}I've got it made.
{30506}{30586}I have a big house, a castle.
{30592}{30643}2500 square meters.
{30691}{30838}Daddy's mausoleum.|No-one in this land has one like it.
{30843}{30912}Ain't it beautiful?|-Very much so.
{31068}{31135}Why are you crying, Dadi?
{31140}{31184}Don't cry.|-Why not?
{31189}{31309}Why shouldn't I cry?|-It's a wonderful house.
{31314}{31393}It's a shame. A shame.|-How come?
{31398}{31459}I've fulfilled all of daddy's wishes.|Except one:
{31465}{31527}Nobody wants to marry my sister.
{31532}{31581}It's a disgrace.
{31586}{31682}Don't you worry, my brother.|All will be well.
{31687}{31790}We'll make this deal|and drink on it.
{31830}{31869}Cheers.
{32482}{32524}Hello, Aksim?
{32528}{32675}I'm in trouble, help me.|I've heard you've got a singer.
{32680}{32826}She can work miracles.
{33189}{33240}Go serve the customer.
{33244}{33345}Wait till he comes in.|-Go water the pole.
{33467}{33553}What's her name? Medusa?
{33574}{33706}Damn, disconnected again.|The devil's playing with that phone.
{33768}{33842}The line got disconnected again.
{33847}{33906}I told you: it's the devil.
{33913}{34053}Damn it. Go water the telephone pole.|I can't do business this way.
{34059}{34131}She's getting on my nerves.
{34513}{34558}Hey you. Come here.
{34644}{34693}Who? Me?
{34698}{34811}Stop acting funny, you're not waiting for|anyone. You're following me all the time.
{34817}{34869}I only want a lemonade.
{34920}{34955}Of course.
{35051}{35142}Go water the pole.|Hurry up. Grab a bucket.
{35177}{35245}Go water the pole.
{35373}{35418}What a jerk.
{35445}{35491}Pour.
{35496}{35589}I don't hear you... I don't hear anything.
{35619}{35669}Pour.
{35692}{35822}Now I can hear you.|Loud and clear.
{35826}{35940}Send that singer with the fast train.
{35945}{36012}She begins tomorrow.
{36018}{36062}And my lemonade?
{36082}{36192}You'll get that when|when the goose grow a beard.
{37276}{37316}Music.
{37454}{37509}My dear grandson.
{37514}{37563}I brought you some clothes.
{37625}{37671}What does the doc say?
{37676}{37784}That I'll live to become 100,|if they leave me alone.
{37789}{37874}And your liver?|-Completely gone to pot.
{37898}{37937}You shouldn't drink anymore.
{37943}{38045}What? I will drink.
{38050}{38099}I will drink if I feel like it.
{38178}{38300}This is a hospital.|Music isn't allowed here.
{38323}{38393}Doctor, you've got to make|an end to this.
{38432}{38528}Imagine what it would be like if|all patients brought an orchestra.
{38532}{38659}You don't have the right to be so cross.
{38663}{38708}It's a matter of respect.
{39315}{39400}What a wonderful life.
{39832}{39888}Excellent booze. I'm on fire.
{39920}{40009}Grandson, I've got to tell you something.
{40134}{40217}You don't have a mother,|your father is no good.
{40222}{40280}I sold the cement factory.
{40287}{40402}Up in smoke. I sold it to|that crook, Dadan.
{40456}{40619}I took the money.|For your future.
{40625}{40696}If you need money,|go to my friend...
{40702}{40755}...whom I haven't seen in 25 years.|His name is...
{40760}{40823}I know. Grga Pitic.|-You know him?
{40828}{40936}You've told me about your friendship|a thousand times.
{40959}{41060}A seven feet giant with|hands like shovels.
{41066}{41108}He's got two rows of teeth.
{41114}{41204}One gold, the other normal.
{41226}{41310}Elegant as a vampire.
{41342}{41423}Music... aggression.
{42113}{42183}Shoot me.
{42190}{42319}Here's a flowerpot.|Leave me alone, Apin.
{43200}{43289}I'll tell you something, old man.|I despise death.
{44290}{44422}"Louis, I think this is the beginning|of a beautiful friendship."
{44678}{44768}Boss, try to taste the difference.
{45116}{45165}Our whisky is better than the real thing.
{45174}{45248}Logical. Our technology is better.
{45426}{45526}Where are you, children?|-We're here, grandpa.
{45580}{45617}Sit down.
{45927}{45980}That's enough, children.
{46087}{46207}You, what have you've been up to?|-You know, I was looking for a wife.
{46211}{46329}He's been to 28 fairs.|-And did he find a wife?
{46378}{46430}Answer him, jackass.
{46436}{46577}There are enough women for fun and|making out, but not to marry.
{46581}{46702}Why? All your friends are married|and have children.
{46708}{46791}When I was your age I had|been married four times.
{46807}{46844}The sister?
{46880}{46952}Find a girl and get it over with.
{46957}{47066}Don't get excited. What was number five|like? The one that stole your heart?
{47072}{47136}Tell me.
{47274}{47341}My darling.
{47395}{47504}Only the memory of her was|enough to lighten my heart.
{47528}{47580}My darling...
{47651}{47697}That's family.
{47703}{47799}As soon as you saw her, you knew|she was the one. That's what I want too.
{47805}{47898}When will that be?|When I'm dead?
{47903}{47991}Why don't you be a good boy and|marry for him.
{47997}{48106}Yesterday I had another attack.|I can barely see.
{48111}{48150}Again?|-Again.
{48167}{48300}I beg you for the last time:|find yourself a wife.
{48305}{48386}Take me to the hospital|to recover.
{48392}{48453}I'll get out for your marriage.
{48459}{48513}Bring me a daughter in law.
{48518}{48569}Ok, grandad.
{48574}{48607}Kssss, cat.
{48674}{48746}Black cats are bad luck.
{49248}{49282}Mincha, brother.
{49287}{49416}Take care of the passenger train,|I'll take the goods train.
{49858}{49909}There's the train.
{49914}{49948}One...
{49980}{50069}...two, three...
{50168}{50221}...five...
{50238}{50293}...six...
{51087}{51129}...nineteen...
{51144}{51184}...and twenty.
{51189}{51223}All's well.
{51228}{51304}This calls for a celebration.
{51417}{51491}I was scared shitless to be screwed.
{51547}{51627}The train is here, as promised.
{51632}{51683}The money is here too, as promised.|You got what you asked for.
{51689}{51764}I was anxious when the train|crossed the border.
{51769}{51832}Is all going ahead of schedule?|-You made a promise.
{51837}{51883}Cheers.
{52352}{52402}Why are you hiding?
{52407}{52509}Dammit, I call the shots around here.
{52518}{52565}Stop, young man.
{52678}{52726}That suitcase is mine.
{52743}{52805}But I gave everybody their share.
{53943}{53990}Where's the rest?
{53998}{54075}It's all, I swear on the Bible.
{54421}{54471}There must be a misunderstanding.
{54548}{54596}You black soul!
{54617}{54671}I should finish you.|-No.
{54828}{54898}Shame on you.
{55184}{55252}Here's the little birdy.|He's sleeping.
{57362}{57406}My suitcase.
{57648}{57712}Give back my suitcase, thief.
{57774}{57820}I spit on your dead.
{58140}{58213}Get down, you pig.
{58345}{58410}I want my suitcase back.
{58634}{58688}I'll climb up there.
{58853}{58962}The moment has arrived|for you and me...
{58967}{59020}...to look each other in the eye.
{59025}{59110}Just you and me.
{59115}{59187}Bloody son of a bitch.
{59437}{59476}I'm here.
{59649}{59726}Man, this is way too high.
{60138}{60194}Dadan, brother.
{60359}{60432}Dadan, It's me. Matko.
{60448}{60506}The train is not here.|-What?
{60511}{60574}Did he cross the border?
{60634}{60755}Answer me. Where are my 17 tankers|I paid for?
{60760}{60880}It crossed the border 30 minutes ago.|It's here somewhere.
{60885}{60979}Here? Where?|You don't lose track of a train.
{60984}{61094}Somebody drugged me.|I was asleep for only 10 minutes.
{61099}{61141}-Who done it?
{61146}{61179}He did.
{61211}{61294}It was him.|-That pig?
{61342}{61446}My Bulgarian custom officers|didn't see no train.
{61477}{61580}They're lying. They're double crossing,|but they will have to pay.
{61585}{61666}A train rides on track,|not just through the woods.
{61671}{61736}It can't just have gone up in smoke,|or can it? Boss?
{61805}{61864}No way, dammit.
{62217}{62253}My dear public...
{62259}{62375}After a triumphant tour in|North-Africa, Asia and Australia...
{62381}{62539}...I'm proud to present to you:|Medusa.
{62544}{62612}An act, never seen before:
{62617}{62759}...to pull a nail from a beam|in the most spectacular fashion.
{62764}{62885}It wasn't an ordinary fight,|but more one man against King Kong.
{62891}{62928}Who was the man?|-Me.
{62933}{62972}It wasn't an ordinary Bulgarian.
{62977}{63116}That jerk could only pass the|doorway sideways.
{63121}{63182}Name?|-Rambo.
{63188}{63298}A warm welcome for this|young man named Rambo.
{63303}{63412}Please hold your breaths,|my honored guests...
{63417}{63534}The great, unforgettable,|breathtaking moment is near.
{63538}{63675}It will be burned into your memory.
{63680}{63778}I proposed an honest fight.
{63783}{63876}But he kicked me in the balls.
{63881}{63999}I grabbed him by the hair and whirled|his head around. He gets angry.
{64004}{64119}I had to save my skin after all,|didn't I?
{65404}{65567}You'll return my money tonight at|11 o'clock.
{65571}{65623}Otherwise I'll hang you by the balls|on the windmill.
{65746}{65804}So you can learn to be an astronaut.
{65830}{65863}Jerk.
{66051}{66103}Don't you have the money?
{66135}{66169}I'm in trouble.
{66174}{66271}Three tankers were mine.|I invested all I got.
{66701}{66844}I've got a cunning plan.|There's a different solution.
{66889}{66970}Yesterday I bought your father's factory|in the hospital.
{66975}{67057}The cement factory?|-I paid it.
{67062}{67115}You can always ask.
{67120}{67240}But it's not enough to cover your debt.|It's only two thirds.
{67481}{67554}I've got a better idea.
{67763}{67868}You have a marriageable son.|And I've got a marriageable sister.
{67945}{68059}We arrange a marriage|and forget your debt.
{68065}{68153}I'll give you anything you want, Dadi.|But that's impossible. -Why?
{68217}{68259}I'll bet the nail.
{68265}{68302}Name?
{68340}{68465}Don't lose your soul.|How can you propose something like that?
{68470}{68551}Your sister is 25, my son 17.
{68558}{68641}Younger men like ripe women.
{68646}{68695}And that's not all, Dadi.
{68704}{68770}What else?|-You know, you know.
{68776}{68880}She looks like a little Smurf.|Everyone calls her little Lady-bird.
{68885}{68967}So what? A diamond is small,|but valuable.
{69036}{69106}Wanna bet? Doesn't matter what.
{69257}{69291}Hands off.
{69355}{69398}Let's toast on the deal.
{69403}{69473}No. I've got it figured now.
{69479}{69557}I know who stole my train|and drugged me.
{69562}{69684}And who messed with my father|and stole my heritage.
{69689}{69760}Safet. Kazatchok.
{69765}{69842}I know who cheated my father.
{70174}{70211}Last chance.
{70323}{70381}The moment of truth.
{70683}{70752}Kiss my ass.
{71265}{71305}Attention.
{71344}{71432}One, two, three... freedom.
{72681}{72722}What are you doing?
{73445}{73483}ls this seat taken?
{73570}{73656}What do you want?|-Lemonade.
{74315}{74383}Hey you.|-Me?
{74388}{74429}Get an ice-cream.
{74754}{74819}I'm not an errand-boy.
{74824}{74942}You're always following me around,|might as well make yourself useful.
{75015}{75076}Don't you think so?|-Exactly.
{75553}{75594}Out of the way.
{75617}{75665}Strawberry or vanilla?
{75670}{75761}Strawberry and vanilla. Four servings.
{77345}{77398}Where are you going?
{77426}{77469}Are you in a hurry?
{77506}{77556}I've got to tell you something.
{77915}{78025}Where did you go to?|-Finish my lemonade.
{78162}{78230}Shame you're getting married.
{78235}{78314}I just thought: he's young, but handsome.
{78319}{78360}I'm falling in love.
{78365}{78429}And now you're getting married.
{78434}{78511}Married? Who's getting married?
{78517}{78558}I'm only thinking about you.
{78563}{78625}I'm always here for you.
{78630}{78696}It's over. Don't make a fuss.
{78743}{78836}That's a lie.|Someone's setting me up.
{78847}{78928}Don't lie to me. I'm too young,|I don't want to marry.
{78934}{78999}Prepare yourself to get engaged.
{79005}{79126}I overheard your father and Dadan|in my grandma's inn.
{79131}{79211}They agreed last night.
{79379}{79429}It's a shame. Here.
{80595}{80685}Dadan stole the factory.|That son of a bitch.
{80717}{80858}And now he wants me too.|You know how many people he cheated.
{80880}{80988}He got the train, the factory...|What else does he want?
{80993}{81034}What else?
{81039}{81089}His mother's pussy.
{81123}{81169}The Russians are here.
{81200}{81248}The water is nice.
{81297}{81355}He wants something else...
{81404}{81440}...that Dadan.
{81446}{81557}He wants to arrange a marriage|to pay of my debt.
{81578}{81636}A marriage? For whom?
{81666}{81758}For our child Zare and his sister.
{81764}{81814}The Lady-bird.
{81819}{81908}That bawler, the midget?
{81914}{81988}She's barely three feet tall.
{81993}{82111}Now I have to ask the help|of my friend Grga Pitic.
{82116}{82181}You're coming with me.|-It's too late.
{82276}{82370}Grga Pitic... is dead.
{82376}{82425}Dead?
{82779}{82854}God have mercy on his soul.|I haven't had a drink yet...
{82860}{82933}...but I'll have one now|for his salvation.
{83513}{83552}Grandfather.
{83689}{83743}There's my grandson.
{83748}{83800}Ain't he handsome?
{84023}{84060}I'll introduce you.
{84065}{84110}Hello, nurse.
{84129}{84177}Have you seen her?|-Who?
{84183}{84221}The girl.
{84312}{84345}No.
{84351}{84392}The nurse.
{84398}{84459}They call her Candy.
{84465}{84551}Those boobies, that body.
{84556}{84622}And that tiny butt. All so delicate.
{84627}{84725}I want love at first sight,|or nothing at all.
{84730}{84821}Love at first sight? Ridiculous.
{84847}{84927}The son of your deceased friend Zarija|dropped by.
{84932}{84973}He came for help.
{85000}{85056}All his money is being stolen.
{85061}{85145}I've got a score to settle with|those villains, with Little Grga.
{85150}{85246}We'll skin them like cats|and eat them alive.
{85251}{85343}I'm coming with you.|I want to see the grave of Zarija.
{85347}{85394}As you will, grandad.
{85425}{85491}It was only a proposition.
{85500}{85596}Nobody listens to me.|I'm talking to you.
{85601}{85678}I'm not getting married this way.|-Shame on you.
{85706}{85741}Miss, please.
{85747}{85804}You're my greatest enemy.
{85809}{85869}You're no brother to me.
{85874}{85918}You're a butcher.
{85944}{86040}Must our parents|curse me from their grave?
{86044}{86086}I don't want to marry.
{86097}{86160}I'm not getting married. Do you hear me?
{86177}{86284}If my true love appears,|I'll marry him.
{86338}{86411}Waist, 68.|-Who is it?
{86416}{86486}Tell me. Who is it?
{86491}{86549}I'll know when I see him.
{86554}{86644}I saw him a hundred times in my dreams.|I know what he looks like.
{86650}{86725}I know his eyes,|his face, his lips.
{86730}{86766}He's tall, very tall...
{86772}{86869}Which tall man would want you,|stupid goose?
{86874}{86926}You're barely over three feet.
{86931}{86978}One day he'll come.
{86984}{87065}Breast, 88.|-Silence. Leave me alone.
{87070}{87103}Safet.
{87108}{87147}Cool down.
{87261}{87323}When will you let me find peace|in my own home?
{87741}{87826}Let me go.|I'll marry the man I love.
{87961}{87997}Pull.
{88089}{88158}Little sister... what can I do?
{88167}{88261}Daddy's looking at you, little sister.
{88478}{88527}Are you convinced?
{88576}{88640}I'll turn you into a fountain.
{88655}{88735}Fuck you... Go on.
{88740}{88801}I'll marry the man I love.
{88806}{88899}What about your soul?|-Our parents are watching from above.
{88904}{88966}They can't see anything, it's clouded.
{89877}{89924}Hands up in the air.
{90025}{90090}Dadan. You're doing fine.
{90111}{90187}Move over, let the lady sit.
{90465}{90498}Congratulations.
{90503}{90546}Do you want something to drink?|-Coffee.
{90550}{90604}Only coffee?|-Only coffee.
{90609}{90659}Can I help you?
{90664}{90726}Ask Matko, that dumb ass.
{90731}{90802}Take care of the kitchen,|I fear the worst.
{90865}{90997}The one who looks like a vampire|and the fat one are married.
{91043}{91100}So only the little one is left.
{91106}{91181}They call her Little Lady-bird|or Smurf.
{91187}{91224}That midget?
{91229}{91280}Yes, in her bridal gown.
{91286}{91326}Good luck.
{91356}{91394}Never.
{91412}{91484}I'm here for business.
{91488}{91521}What business, Sujka?
{91527}{91587}You marry my Ida.
{91592}{91645}I see she pleases you.
{91664}{91709}My Ida.
{91714}{91814}You'll won't find a prettier girl|in the whole region.
{91819}{91958}I fed her from her birth.
{91963}{92009}We've been everywhere.
{92014}{92098}In spas|to make her beautiful.
{92135}{92203}To buy her Italian clothes...
{92208}{92326}...we went to Rome and Napels.|-Liar.
{92331}{92396}I showed her all countries.
{92401}{92479}In the end we went to Sweden.
{92485}{92544}I know. To beg.
{92600}{92742}At least we didn't scavenge the trash|like you did.
{92753}{92803}How much do you ask?
{92865}{92948}Give me 35.000 marks.
{93011}{93079}Grandma.
{93107}{93161}15.000 up front and 15.000 after.
{93167}{93211}For such a tip even I won't marry.
{93220}{93305}17.000 in three parts?|-At once.
{93311}{93376}And I don't want see you ever again.
{93382}{93436}Your Grandma's selling you like a cow.
{93462}{93503}Never.
{94686}{94730}Carry me.
{94779}{94832}Come on, carry me.
{95287}{95344}You're a weirdo.
{95354}{95403}And now...kiss me.
{97612}{97651}Damn tie.
{97715}{97785}Save me, grandpa. Don't let me be married.
{98077}{98126}I'll drink his blood.
{98146}{98190}Take it easy.
{98241}{98301}Give me that gun. Calm down.
{98307}{98351}The gun.|-I'll finish him.
{98450}{98495}You should be ashamed of yourself.
{98501}{98536}Give me that gun.
{98551}{98616}Relax. Keep cool.
{98814}{98862}I'll teach him.
{98985}{99069}I know what I have to do.
{99078}{99150}I don't want to.|-Listen.
{99156}{99216}I was nearly dead. Listen.
{99222}{99288}Her brother Dadan|is a war criminal.
{99294}{99340}He'll exterminate our family.
{99346}{99433}He'll drink our blood.|-But she's a midget.
{99438}{99523}O mirror, the dead with the dead...
{99529}{99598}....the living with the living,|the children with their father.
{99605}{99670}For two months.|Then you get a divorce.
{99725}{99783}...the dead with the dead...
{99819}{99859}I don't want to marry.
{100022}{100065}I won't.
{100232}{100368}I'll prevent the marriage in an|elegant manner.
{100497}{100531}Zare.
{100651}{100700}You'll get punished.
{100706}{100782}You'll fulfill your draft|in the zoo.
{100980}{101067}I'll fuck your ratface.
{101308}{101343}Where is he?
{101348}{101392}Who?|-Your grandson.
{101454}{101514}Go ahead, play. Great.
{101528}{101637}Where is he?|Should Dadan slaughter us all?
{101721}{101796}Where is my son?|-I don't know. Couldn't care less.
{101802}{101859}Where is he?|-I don't know.
{102134}{102174}Get out of there.
{102187}{102255}You shouldn't hide your shoe.
{102374}{102417}You should be ashamed of yourself.
{102423}{102473}It's a disgrace.
{102614}{102763}the dead with the dead,|the living with the living...
{103425}{103462}Granddad.
{103763}{103813}He doesn't breathe anymore.
{103896}{103943}Grandpa is dead.
{103949}{103982}Come.
{103995}{104042}He is dead.
{104068}{104126}Come, grandpa is dead.
{104540}{104605}His heart stopped beating.
{104785}{104830}Dead?
{104916}{105008}Do you die on the day your|grandson marries?
{105014}{105055}The day he marries...
{105067}{105168}Grandpa saved me. He saved me.
{105190}{105276}We'll flee together after the|period of mourning.
{105299}{105401}You'll need a costume, shoes,|a butterfly-tie...
{105406}{105473}Wreaths of flowers, candles...
{105613}{105668}Definitively dead.
{106018}{106109}Ah it's you, Matko, you womanizer.
{106154}{106223}You're early. Eight o'clock, you said.
{106229}{106280}Where's the son in law?
{106293}{106369}I've got something to tell you.
{106375}{106452}It's urgent.|I've got to talk to you in private.
{106458}{106558}Today I only want to hear good news.
{106846}{106879}I'm listening.
{106994}{107037}My father is dead.
{107166}{107247}Really?|-Yes.
{107251}{107317}My condolences.|-What can I do?
{107323}{107424}A marriage and a funeral don't|get along well.
{107487}{107537}He can die in three days.
{107543}{107612}But he died this morning.
{107618}{107695}Who says so? Who knows?
{107701}{107767}I know. Zare...
{107772}{107877}I told you straight away.|We'll have to mourn for forty days.
{107882}{107958}I'll mourn with you... in three days.
{108091}{108139}You're a wise man.
{108145}{108205}You didn't stop the preparations?
{108211}{108257}Sure I did.
{108262}{108350}Should my father turn in his grave?
{108355}{108395}Of course not.
{108400}{108473}Don't tell anyone about the old man.
{108478}{108570}It doesn't matter to him if he dies on|Wednesday or Friday.
{108576}{108633}Death's forever.
{108677}{108744}It doesn't matter when it begins.
{108750}{108824}You didn't hear anything.|-Nope.
{108830}{108897}We didn't hear anything.|-No.
{108918}{108958}Me neither.
{108964}{109050}Wait for the guests|and get the bride.
{109055}{109126}As you like, Dadi.|-Cheers.
{109298}{109362}He doesn't want to hear it.|-What?
{109415}{109530}Even if he kills us and places us dead at|the dinner table, the wedding will continue!
{109536}{109569}I don't want to.
{109580}{109655}Does he have to rip my head off?
{109711}{109756}Take this.
{109786}{109832}For your soul, daddy.
{109871}{109953}Take his legs. We are going to the attic.
{110061}{110119}Turn him aside.
{110312}{110363}Get ice downstairs.
{110369}{110418}Hurry up!
{110442}{110476}Quick!
{110755}{110857}Don't do this to me.|You don't need money anymore.
{111536}{111604}Put his legs on the chair.
{111698}{111754}Get the grandchildren of Grga Pitic here!
{111760}{111867}I left six messages.|They don't answer.
{111873}{111928}Who knows where they are?
{111957}{112009}Daddy, forgive me.
{112772}{112827}Hold it above the bride.
{112833}{112897}Hold it above her head.|-I don't want to.
{113730}{113770}Get away you.
{114186}{114294}Take the child, it will bring you luck.
{114378}{114439}This is the most beautiful day...
{114445}{114532}....of your whole life.

{143198}{143248}She is not here.
{143293}{143347}Maybe she is in the woods.
{143424}{143517}What a shame the bride runs|away from her own wedding.
{143523}{143612}Everybody will talk about it for years.
{143618}{143652}Nonsense.
{143659}{143742}I will find her. The wedding will continue.

{146421}{146494}Little Grga, do you hear me?
{146517}{146573}Where did you find that atlas?
{146623}{146656}Are you asleep?
{147050}{147115}I am in trouble.
{147619}{147656}That's destiny.

{147963}{148045}Nobody ever revolted against Dadan...
{148051}{148099}...except her.
{148158}{148229}I am afraid.
{148235}{148381}Why? We will manage fine.
{148547}{148646}Congratulations, son. brilliant idea.
{150897}{150974}I thought it was my imagination.
{151026}{151108}But it's destiny.

{151550}{151658}We will find it.|But this is one hundred percent destiny!
{151664}{151678}Exactly.

{152396}{152452}My sister...|-Quiet.
{152577}{152687}It's a misunderstanding.
{152858}{152903}Why do you shoot like that?
{152930}{153003}And you, girl, you are in trouble.
{153009}{153051}You will pay.
{153056}{153141}If the girl has any debts|I will pay them.
{153392}{153462}What are you looking at? Do something.
{153631}{153672}Grga.
{153731}{153765}Give me back my sister.
{153771}{153816}Stop or I will shoot you.
{153822}{153895}Fuck off. Come here, sis.

{154355}{154389}Sister in law...
{154421}{154464}Who are they?|-Put your guns down.
{154470}{154503}Stop.
{154509}{154559}She is my sister. Understand?

{154634}{154724}But I do know her.|-And I know him.
{154730}{154801}Continue your path.|My path leads to her
{154806}{154969}If you are really her brother,|we can come to an agreement.
{154974}{155047}I want to marry her immediately.
{155098}{155170}She just ran away from her wedding.
{155176}{155295}You can run away from a fake marriage,|but you can't hide from destiny.
{155468}{155522}What a sniper.
{155549}{155611}Where did that asshole come from?
{155642}{155686}Put down your guns.
{155742}{155815}You call this driving, idiot?
{155821}{155866}You took the wrong road.
{155875}{155948}Ok, but look what I found.
{156077}{156110}Very good.
{156116}{156161}Take it easy.
{156167}{156214}This isn't necessary.
{156466}{156533}How's it going, Consignor Grga?
{156539}{156586}Is it you, worthless piece of shit?
{156592}{156641}What are you doing here?
{156647}{156702}We were just talking.
{156709}{156756}Talking about what?
{156810}{156874}Are you here to pay off your debt?
{156905}{156949}Do you know each other?
{156955}{157051}My last resort in ltaly, in 1982.
{157056}{157127}He was a student in my brigade.
{157133}{157180}The worst kind.
{157186}{157297}Because of him I lost ground.
{157940}{157997}I live nearby.
{158298}{158369}Don't you want to marry her?|-No.
{158375}{158420}I want her.
{158447}{158484}We shall see.

{158861}{158981}And you do not object to your|sister marrying my grandson?
{158987}{159064}Of course not, if they love each other.
{159116}{159167}Why do you look so sad?
{159173}{159216}What's wrong?
{159242}{159288}Ah yes, he needs to go to the factory...
{159330}{159429}...and pay back the three|tankers of gasoline.
{159435}{159486}Do you know how much that is?
{159492}{159565}He will pay at once.|-Of course.
{159571}{159649}And the wedding must|start immediately.
{159655}{159775}The wedding can begin.|Music. It's my treat.
{159967}{160024}What counts, is that love conquers all.
{160031}{160077}Cheers.
{160116}{160172}Has he drank yet?|-Not yet.
{160224}{160320}My beautiful sisters.|-I hope there won't be any complications.

{161167}{161254}Once we are there,|it's already day again.
{161260}{161297}Whatever.
{161303}{161399}My servants will bring|you to the graveyard.
{161516}{161584}But to which graveyard?
{161831}{161878}Give me the money.
{161895}{161932}Traitor.
{161938}{161997}It was only ethical.
{162066}{162154}You must have fun. Eat and drink.
{162160}{162235}Your sister is happy, so is my son.

{163477}{163533}Am I right?|-Completely.
{163539}{163603}Shall we put him in the attic?
{163806}{163902}We told his grandchildren,|we brought him to the graveyard.
{163908}{164005}What about the official?|-Which official?
{164011}{164115}He must cancel the first wedding|and perform the second wedding.
{164121}{164205}Don'worry,|I will get him.
