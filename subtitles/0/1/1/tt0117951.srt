{233}{348} Choose life. Choose|a job. Choose a career. Choose a family.
{349}{430}Choose a fucking big television.|Choose washing machines, cars...
{432}{480}compact disc players|and electrical tin openers.
{522}{613}- Gangway! Run!
{711}{774}- Choose good health...
{775}{835}Iow cholesterol|and dental insurance.
{837}{893}Choose fixed-interest|mortgage payments.
{894}{964}Choose a starter home.|Choose your friends.
{964}{1064}Choose leisure wear|and matching luggage.
{1065}{1127}Choose a three-piece suite on hire|purchase in a range of fucking fabrics.
{1129}{1218}Chose D.I.Y. and wondering who the fuck|you are on a Sunday morning.
{1220}{1298}Choose sitting on that couch|watching mind-numbing,|spirit-crushing game shows...
{1300}{1363}stuffing fucking junk food|into your mouth.
{1505}{1584}- Jammy goal!
{1584}{1640} Choose rotting away|at the end of it all.
{1640}{1708}Pissing your last in a miserable home;|nothing more than an embarrassment...
{1711}{1786}to the selfish, fucked-up brats|that you've spawned to replace yourself.
{1788}{1860}Choose your future.|Choose life.
{1862}{1973} Here comes Johnny|Yeah, yeah
{1975}{2086}- But why would I want|to do a thing like that?
{2088}{2183} He's gonna do|another striptease
{2185}{2279}- I chose not to choose life.|I chose something else.
{2281}{2392}And the reasons?|There are no reasons.
{2393}{2476}Who needs reasons|when you've got heroin?
{2478}{2533} Yeah, a song called love
{2535}{2652} Well, dance like you're|hypnotized chickens
{2722}{2782}"Goldfinger's" better than "Dr. No."
{2784}{2890}Both of them are a lot better than|"Diamonds Are Forever."
{2892}{3008}A judgment reflected in its relatively|poor showing at the box office.
{3009}{3074}And in which field,|of course...
{3075}{3189}"Thunderball" was a notable success.
{3190}{3249} People think|it's all about misery and desperation...
{3251}{3317}and death and all that shite,|which is not to be ignored.
{3320}{3416}Fuck off!|Jealous cunt.
{3418}{3517} But what they|forget is the pleasure of it.
{3519}{3585}- They're all dead, right, mate?
{3587}{3643}You prick!
{3645}{3722}Otherwise we wouldn't do it.
{3724}{3818}- Do you want me to?|- Yeah.
{3820}{3924}Pure as the driven snow,|that shit you done.
{3991}{4081}After all, we're not fucking stupid.|At least we're not that fucking stupid.
{4390}{4449}Take the best orgasm you've ever had...
{4451}{4545}multiply it by a thousand,|and you're still nowhere near it.
{4547}{4628}It beats any meat injection.
{4698}{4793}That beats any fucking cock|in the world.
{4795}{4888} When you're on|junk, you have only one worry: scoring.
{4889}{4970}And when you're off it,|you're suddenly obliged to worry|about all sorts of other shite.
{4972}{5051}Got no money, can't get drunk.|Got money, drinkin' too much.
{5053}{5141}Can't get a girl, no chance of a ride.|Got a girl, too much hassle.
{5143}{5203}You have to worry|about bills, about food...
{5205}{5260}about some football team|that never fucking wins.
{5261}{5336}About human relationships and all|the things that really don't matter...
{5338}{5432}when you've got a sincere|and truthful junk habit.
{5463}{5530}I'd say, in those days,|he was a muscular actor.
{5576}{5657}With all the presence of someone|like Cooper or Lancaster...
{5659}{5726}but combined|with a sly wit...
{5728}{5833}-to make him a formidable romantic lead.
{5834}{5933}And closer, in that respect,|to Cary Grant.
{5935}{6008}Ahh.
{6010}{6112} Hey, man, where'd you|get that illusion
{6412}{6506} The only drawback,|or at least the principal drawback...
{6508}{6562}is that you have to endure all manner|of cunts telling you that -
{6564}{6648}No way would I poison my body|with that shite.
{6677}{6742}All them fucking chemicals.
{6768}{6834}No fucking way.
{6836}{6901}It's a waste of your life, man...
{6903}{6961}poisoning your body|with that shite.
{6961}{7054}Every chance you've had, son,|you've blown it.
{7057}{7113}Stuffing your veins|with that filth.
{7114}{7187} From time to time,|even I have uttered the magic words.
{7321}{7376}Never again, Swanney.|I'm off the skag.
{7379}{7425}- Are you serious?|- Yeah, no more.
{7426}{7497}- I'm finished with that shite.|- Well, that's up to you, man.
{7499}{7562}Gonna do it right this time. Gonna get|it sorted out, get off it for good.
{7564}{7645}- I'm sure I've heard that one before.|- The Sick Boy method.
{7647}{7710}Oh, well, it really worked|for him, eh?
{7712}{7767}Well, he's always been|lacking in moral fiber.
{7769}{7846}- He knows a lot about Sean Connery.|- That's hardly a substitute.
{7848}{7920}- You need one more hit?|- No, I don't think so.
{7921}{7993}- For the long night that lies ahead?
{7995}{8053}We called him Mother Superior...
{8055}{8108}on account of the length|of his habit.
{8111}{8194}Of course, I'd have another shot.|After all, I had work to do.
{8595}{8687} Relinquishing junk.|Stage one: preparation.
{8776}{8863}For this, you will need one room|which you will not leave.
{8865}{8974}Soothing music.|Tomato soup, ten tins of.
{8976}{9072}Mushroom soup, eight tins of,|for consumption cold.
{9073}{9145}Ice cream, vanilla,|one large tub of.
{9146}{9195}Magnesia, milk of,|one bottle.
{9197}{9255}Paracetamol, mouthwash, vitamins.
{9257}{9349}Mineral water,|Lucozade, pornography.
{9391}{9445}One mattress.|One bucket for urine...
{9447}{9548}one for feces|and one for vomitus.
{9549}{9636}One television and one bottle|of Valium, which I've already|procured from my mother...
{9638}{9766}who is, in her own domestic and socially|acceptable way, also a drug addict.
{9854}{9958}Now I'm ready. All I need is|one final hit to soothe the pain...
{9960}{10023}while the Valium takes effect.
{10076}{10150}Mikey? Aye, yeah,|it's Mark Renton.
{10152}{10211}Look, I wondered,|could you help me out?
{10213}{10277}This was typical of Mikey Forrester.
{10279}{10328}What the fuck are these?
{10330}{10377}Under the normal run of things...
{10378}{10457}I would have nothing to do|with the cunt, but this was not|the normal run of things.
{10459}{10571}Opium suppositories.|Ideal for your purposes.
{10573}{10682}Slow release,|bring you down gradually.
{10684}{10778}-Custom-fucking-designed for your needs.|-I want a fucking hit.
{10780}{10859}That's all I've got, man.|Take it or leave it.
{11121}{11193}- Are you feeling better now then, eh?|- Oh, aye.
{11194}{11275}For all the good they've done, I might|as well have stuck them up my arse.
{11329}{11377}Heroin makes you constipated.
{11378}{11425}The heroin from my last hit|is fading away...
{11426}{11488}and the suppositories|have yet to melt.
{11490}{11599}I'm no longer constipated.
{11794}{11879} I fantasize|about a massive pristine convenience.
{11881}{12017}Brilliant gold taps, virginal white|marble, a seat carved from ebony...
{12019}{12079}a cistern full of Chanel No. 5|and a flunky...
{12081}{12146}handing me pieces|of raw silk toilet roll.
{12148}{12219}But under the circumstances,|I'll settle for anywhere.
{12724}{12813}Oh, fuck.
{12865}{12955}Oh, my -
{14963}{15069}Yes, a fucking dancer!
{15947}{16054}And now, now I'm ready.
{16056}{16108}The downside of coming off junk|was I knew...
{16109}{16157}I would need to mix|with my friends again...
{16159}{16208}in a state|of full consciousness.
{16209}{16253}It was awful.
{16254}{16322}They reminded me so much of myself|I could hardly bear to look at them.
{16324}{16405}Take Sick Boy, for instance.|He came off junk at the same time as me.
{16406}{16483}Not because he wanted to,|you understand, but just to annoy me.
{16485}{16536}Just to show me how easily|he could do it.
{16538}{16589}Thereby, downgrading my own struggle.
{16591}{16640}Sneaky fucker,|don't you think?
{16642}{16726}And when all I wanted to do was|lie there and feel sorry for myself...
{16728}{16811}he insisted on telling me once again|about his unifying theory of life.
{16813}{16888}It's certainly a phenomenon|in all walks of life.
{16890}{16938}What do you mean?
{16940}{17041}Well, at one point, you've got it,|then you lose it.
{17043}{17123}And it's gone forever.|All walks of life.
{17125}{17208}Georgie Best, for example,|had it, lost it.
{17210}{17270}Or David Bowie or Lou Reed.
{17272}{17322}Lou Reed.|Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
{17324}{17392}No, it's not bad,|but it's not great either, is it?
{17393}{17461}And in your heart you kind of know|that although it sounds all right...
{17463}{17548}it's actually just shite.
{17585}{17655}So, who else?
{17657}{17761}- Charlie Nicholas, David Niven,|Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley -|- Okay, okay, okay.
{17763}{17824}So what is the point|you're trying to make?
{17826}{17905} All I am trying|to do, Mark...
{17907}{18011}is to help you understand that "The|Name of the Rose" is merely a blip...
{18013}{18089}on an otherwise uninterrupted|downward trajectory.
{18091}{18165}What about|"The Untouchables"?
{18167}{18275}- I don't rate that at all.|- Despite the Academy Award?
{18277}{18375}That means fuck-all.|It's a sympathy vote.
{18415}{18517}So, we all get old.|We can't hack it anymore and that's it?
{18518}{18621}- Yeah.|- That's your theory?
{18622}{18682}Yeah.
{18684}{18739}Beautifully fucking illustrated.
{18741}{18800}Give me the gun.
{18837}{18896}Give me the gun.
{19002}{19073}Do you see the beast?
{19074}{19141}Have you got it in your sights?
{19142}{19204}Clear enough, Miss Moneypenny.
{19205}{19317}- This should present|no significant problems.
{19447}{19517}- Fucking hell! Get away -
{19519}{19648}- For a vegetarian, Rents,|you're a fuckin' evil shot.
{19649}{19715}No! Get off!|- Without heroin...
{19717}{19800}I attempted to lead a useful|and fulfilling life as a good citizen.
{19907}{19984}- Good luck, Spud.|- Cheers, cowboy.
{19985}{20060}Now remember, if they think you're|not trying, you're in trouble, right?
{20062}{20143}First hint of that, and they'll be onto|the D.H.S.S., "This cunt is not trying."
{20145}{20193}And your giro's|fuckin' finished, right?
{20195}{20244}- Right.|- But, then again, try too hard -
{20245}{20311}- You might get the fuckin' job.|- Exactly.
{20313}{20396}- Nightmare.|- It's a tightrope, Spud.|It's a fuckin' tightrope.
{20398}{20489}See, I just get pure shy with|the interviewer cats. I get all nervous.
{20490}{20559}I can't answer any of their questions,|like I'm a footballer...
{20561}{20616}and I get nerves|on the big occasion, man.
{20617}{20713}- Try some of this, Spud.|- Yeah, a little dab of speed|is just the ticket, mate.
{20760}{20873}No, I went to Craignewton.|I just put down Royal Edinburgh College|to help get the job.
{20874}{20924}There's too much discrimination|in this town, man.
{20925}{20992}They're both schools, right?|We're all in this together.
{20993}{21060}And I wanted to put across the|general idea, rather than the details.
{21061}{21111}Like people get all|hung up on details.
{21113}{21169}Like which school did I go to?|How many grades did I get?
{21171}{21233}Could be like six. Could be none.|It's not important.
{21235}{21331}What is important|is that I am, yes?
{21333}{21459}- Mr. Murphy, do you mean that|you lied on your application?|- No - Well, yes.
{21461}{21514}Only to get my foot|in the door.
{21516}{21575}Showing initiative|and that like.
{21577}{21623}But you were referred here|by the Department of Employment.
{21625}{21693}There was no need for you to get your|"foot in the door," as you put it.
{21695}{21826}Yeah, cool. Whatever you say. Sorry.|You're the man, the dude in the chair.
{21828}{21921}I am merely here - Like, well,|obviously, I'm here like, but -
{21923}{22020}Mr. Murphy, what exactly attracts you|to the leisure industry?
{22049}{22102}In a word, pleasure.
{22104}{22170}Like, my pleasure|in other people's leisure.
{22172}{22224}Do you see yourself|as having any weaknesses?
{22296}{22362}Oh, yes, 'cause, like, I'm a bit|of a perfectionist, actually!
{22364}{22464}Yes, I am. See, for me, it's got to be|the best, or it's nothing at all.
{22465}{22530}Like things get a bit dodgy,|I just cannot be bothered.
{22532}{22615}But, hey, I'm getting good vibes about|this interview thing today, though, man.
{22617}{22712}Seems to me like it's going|pretty well, eh?
{22713}{22760}Thank you, Mr. Murphy.
{22761}{22857}- We'll let you know.|- The pleasure was mine, man.
{22859}{22921}Spud had done well. I was proud of him.
{22923}{23018}- Thanks. Ooh, sorry.|- He fucked up good and proper.|You had to hand it to Spud.
{23073}{23144} Picture the scene.|The other fuckin' week there...
{23145}{23205}doin' the fuckin' Volley|with Tommy playing pool.
{23207}{23260}I'm playin' like|Paul-fuckin'-Newman by the way...
{23261}{23345}givin' the boy here|the tannin' of a lifetime.
{23347}{23444}So it comes to the last shot, the|deciding ball of the whole tournament.
{23445}{23513}I'm in the black, and he's sittin'|in the corner looking all|fucking biscuit-arsed.
{23514}{23579}When this hard cunt comes in.
{23581}{23696}Obviously fucking fancied himself like.|Starts staring at me.
{23697}{23784}Looking at me, right fucking at me,|as if to say, "Come ahead, square go."
{23786}{23873}You know me. I'm not the type of cunt|that goes looking for fucking bother...
{23875}{23950}but at the end of the day,|I'm the cunt with the pool cue...
{23952}{24036}and he can get the fat end in his puss|any time he fucking wanted, like.
{24037}{24111}So I squares up, casual like.
{24113}{24241}What does the hard cunt do?|Or the so-called hard cunt? Shites it.
{24243}{24333}Puts down his drink,|turns and gets the fuck out of there.
{24335}{24440}And after that, well,|the game was mine.
{24541}{24617} And that was it.|That was Begbie's story...
{24619}{24676}or, at least, that was|Begbie's version of the story.
{24678}{24751}But a couple of days later,|I got the truth from Tommy.
{24752}{24843}You always got the truth from Tommy.|That was one of his major weaknesses.
{24845}{24941}He never told lies, he never took drugs,|and he never cheated on anyone.
{24944}{25073}It was Wednesday morning. We were in the|Volley playing pool. That much is true.
{25074}{25196}But Begbie is playing|absolutely fucking gash.
{25198}{25284}He's got a hangover so bad,|he can hardly hold the fucking cue,|never mind pot a ball.
{25285}{25346}I'm doing my best to lose,|you know.
{25347}{25423}Trying to humor him, like,|but it's not doing any good.
{25426}{25473}Every time I touch a ball,|I seemed to pot something.
{25474}{25525}Every time Begbie goes near the table,|he fucks it up.
{25527}{25578}Oh, fuck's sake.
{25636}{25696}So, he's got the hump, right.
{25697}{25756}But, finally,|I managed to set it up...
{25757}{25804}so all he has to do|is to pot the black...
{25805}{25871}to win one game,|to salvage a little bit of pride...
{25873}{25921}and maybe not|kick my head in, right.
{25923}{25984}So, he's on the black.
{25985}{26057}- Pressure shot.
{26059}{26149}- And it all goes wrong big time.
{26189}{26269}- Fuck!
{26271}{26338} He picks on|this specky, wee gadge at the bar...
{26339}{26409}- and accuses him of putting|him off by looking at him.
{26410}{26469}Could you believe it? The poor wee cunt|hasn't even glanced in our direction.
{26471}{26536}- Fuck off!|- He was gonna chib him, I tell you.
{26539}{26597}Then I thought|he was gonna do me.
{26682}{26730}The beggar's fucking psycho, man.
{26732}{26808}But... he's a mate.
{26809}{26856}You know?|So what can you do?
{26857}{26904}Can I borrow this?
{26905}{26959}What, indeed, could one do?
{26961}{27024}Just stand back and watch|and try not to get involved?
{27073}{27131} Begbie didn't|do drugs either. He just did people.
{27133}{27216}- That's what he got off on.|His own sensory addiction.
{27217}{27283}- Hey!
{27285}{27334}Nobody move!
{27336}{27385}- That lassie got glassed...
{27387}{27486}and no cunt leaves here|'til we find out what cunt did it!
{27488}{27569}- Who the fuck are you?
{28168}{28272}- Oh, Lizzy, you've been so good to me.|- Oh, Tommy, come here.
{28274}{28320}And as I sat watching...
{28322}{28379}the intimate|and highly personal video...
{28381}{28463}stolen only hours earlier|from one of my best friends...
{28464}{28581}I realized that something important|was missing from my life.
{28583}{28671} Leave no track
{28701}{28748} Don't look back
{28750}{28840}- Only desire|- Temptation
{28841}{28940}- We're climbing higher and higher|- Temptation
{28942}{29036}- Adorable creature|- Temptation
{29038}{29115}- You've got acceptable features|- Temptation
{29117}{29194}- Trouble is coming|- Temptation
{29197}{29287}- It's just the high cost of loving|- Temptation
{29289}{29374}- You can take it or leave it|- Temptation
{29377}{29487} But you'd better believe it
{29663}{29739}- I read it in Cosmopolitan.|- It's an interesting theory.
{29741}{29787}Actually, it's a nightmare.
{29789}{29881}I've been desperate for a shag,|but watching him suffer|is just too much fun.
{29883}{29937}You should try it with Tommy.
{29938}{30021}What? And deny myself|the only pleasure I get from him?
{30023}{30081}- Did I tell you about my birthday?|- No, what happened?
{30083}{30144}He forgot.|Useless motherfucker.
{30247}{30337} Leave no trace
{30338}{30389} Find your place
{30391}{30465}- All I desire|- Temptation
{30467}{30565}- We're climbing higher and higher|- Temptation
{30567}{30648}- You can take it or leave it|- Temptation
{30651}{30757} But you'd better believe it
{30792}{30901}- What are you two talking about?|- Football.
{30903}{30972}- What are you talking about?|- Shopping.
{30974}{31053}The situation was becoming serious.
{31054}{31094}Young Renton noticed...
{31096}{31156}the haste with which the successful|in the sexual sphere...
{31157}{31277}as in all others,|segregated themselves from the failures.
{31279}{31409}- I can't break away|- Keep us from temptation
{31409}{31484} Keep us from temptation
{31485}{31547} Heroin had robbed|Renton of his sex drive...
{31549}{31612}- but now it returned with a vengeance.|- Lead us not into temptation
{31612}{31702}And as the impotence|of those days faded into memory...
{31705}{31780}grim desperation took ahold|in his sex-crazed mind.
{31781}{31863}His post-junk libido,|fueled by alcohol and amphetamine...
{31866}{31961}taunted him remorselessly|with his own unsatisfied desire.
{31963}{32025}Dot, dot, dot.
{32027}{32100}- You think that you're right now|- Temptation
{32101}{32200}- You've got to face up to fact now|- Temptation
{32201}{32272}- Ooh, give me a breakdown|- Temptation
{32273}{32396}- Because it's time for a showdown|- Temptation
{32397}{32483} Temptation, Temptation|Temptation
{33209}{33256} Oh, oh-oh-oh
{33257}{33351} Make me tonight
{33353}{33401} Tonight
{33404}{33502} And with that,|Mark Renton had fallen in love.
{33716}{33804}Excuse me, excuse me. I don't mean to|harass you, but I was very impressed...
{33806}{33858}with the capable and stylish manner|in which you dealt with that situation.
{33860}{33918}I was thinking to myself,|now this girl's special.
{33920}{33952}Thanks.
{33953}{34000}- What's your name?|- Diane.
{34001}{34052}- Where are you going, Diane?|- I'm going home.
{34054}{34096}- Where's that?|- It's where I live.
{34099}{34149}- Great.|- What?
{34151}{34237}I'll come back with you if you like,|but I'm not promising anything.
{34239}{34293}Do you find that|this approach usually works?
{34295}{34353}Or, let me guess,|you've never tried it before.
{34355}{34433}In fact, you don't normally|approach girls. Am I right?
{34435}{34501}The truth is that you're|a quiet, sensitive type...
{34503}{34549}but, if I'm prepared|to take a chance...
{34551}{34601}I might just get to know|the inner you:
{34603}{34709}witty, adventurous,|passionate, loving, loyal -
{34711}{34762}Taxi!
{34764}{34821}A little bit crazy,|a little bit bad.
{34823}{34905}But, hey, don't us girls|just love that?
{34907}{34956}Eh?
{34957}{35060}Well... what's wrong, boy?|Cat got your tongue?
{35061}{35166}- I left something -|- You getting in or not, pal?
{35649}{35728}- Do you understand?
{35729}{35821}I expect you to be a considerate|and thoughtful lover.
{35822}{35869}Generous but firm.
{35870}{35920}- What?|- Failure on your part...
{35921}{35972}to live up to these|very reasonable expectations...
{35973}{36070}will result in swift resumption|of a non-sex situation.
{36072}{36120}Right?
{36409}{36455}- Diane.
{36457}{36503}- Shh.|- What?
{36505}{36552} Shut up!
{37512}{37566}Wake up, Spud.
{37568}{37614}- Wake up.
{37616}{37686}- Sex.
{37688}{37737}Casual sex.
{37911}{37997}- Tommy, let's put the tape on.|- Now?
{37999}{38069}I want to watch ourselves|while we're screwing.
{38070}{38141}So let's see|what I'm missing.
{38452}{38498}Not much.
{38609}{38660}And there's the captain,|Archie Gemmill...
{38662}{38709}picking it up|from the outside.
{38711}{38772}I think he wants to go himself.|How far is he gonna go?
{38773}{38856}He's going all the way,|and he scores!
{38857}{38904}- Oh, what a magnificent goal!
{38905}{38974}- Gemmill at his very best!
{38976}{39032}What a penetrating goal that was!
{39033}{39080} I haven't felt that good...
{39081}{39142}since Archie Gemmill scored|against Holland in 1978.
{39200}{39248}- Renton...
{39250}{39297}- you can't sleep here.|- What?
{39298}{39346}Out.
{39348}{39394}- Come on.|- No argument.
{39396}{39494}You can sleep on the sofa in the hall|or go home. It's up to you.
{39496}{39576}And don't make any noise.
{39577}{39628}Jesus.
{39798}{39852} What do you mean, it's gone?|Where has it gone, Tommy?
{39853}{39905}It'll be here somewhere!
{39948}{39997}I might have returned it|by mistake.
{39999}{40136}"Returned it"? Where?|The video shop, Tommy?
{40137}{40184}The fucking video shop?
{40185}{40308}So every punter in Edinburgh|is jerking off to our video?
{40309}{40398}Oh, God, Tommy,|I feel sick!
{41200}{41266}- Hi.|- Hello.
{42010}{42057}Eh?
{42306}{42356}Come in and sit down.
{42357}{42445}- Like some coffee?|- Aye.
{42490}{42580}- You must be Mark.|- Aye, that's me.
{42698}{42772}- You're a friend of Diane's?|- More a friend of a friend, no?
{42774}{42821}Right.
{42870}{42917}Are you her flatmates?
{42918}{43001} "Flatmates"?
{43002}{43076}- I must remember that one.
{43078}{43128} 'Morning.
{43474}{43552}- Good morning, Spud.|- 'Morning, Gail. Mr. Houston.
{43553}{43614}- Mrs. Houston.|- 'Morning, Spud.
{43616}{43673}Sit down and have some breakfast.
{43710}{43783}Sorry about last night,|by the way.
{43785}{43840}That's all right.|I slept fine on the sofa.
{43889}{43996}I had a bit much to drink.|I had a bit of an accident.
{43998}{44046}Don't worry, son.|These things happen.
{44048}{44096}Does a man good|to cut loose once in awhile.
{44098}{44169}Only this one could do|with being tied up once in a while.
{44170}{44231}I'll put the sheets|in the machine.
{44233}{44304}- No, no, no. I'll-l'll wash them.|- There's no need.
{44306}{44360}- No, it's no problem.|- It's no problem for me either.
{44361}{44433}- I'd rather take care of it myself.|- Honestly, it's no problem.
{44435}{44500}- Really, no!|- Spud, they're my sheets!
{44802}{44873}- I don't see why not.|- Because it's illegal, that's why not.
{44874}{44931}- What, holding hands?|- No, not holding hands.
{44933}{45029}In that case, you can do it. You were|quite happy to do a lot more last night.
{45031}{45093}Yeah, that's what's illegal. Do you know|what they do to people like me inside?
{45095}{45166}They cut your balls off|and flush 'em down the fucking toilet.
{45168}{45216}Calm down.|You're not going to jail.
{45217}{45277}Oh, well, that's very easy|for you to say, Diane.
{45279}{45365}- Can I see you again?|- Certainly not.
{45367}{45452}If you don't see me again,|I'll tell the police.
{45455}{45525}I'll see you around then.
{45859}{45936}- Now what?|- We go for a walk.
{45938}{46012}- What?|- A walk.
{46013}{46060}- Where?|- There.
{46125}{46188}Are you serious?
{46967}{47013}Well, what are you|waiting for?
{47015}{47109}Hey, Tommy...
{47110}{47164}this is not natural, man.
{47166}{47242}It's the great outdoors!
{47244}{47294}It's fresh air!
{47296}{47353}Look, Tommy, we know you're getting|a hard time off Lizzy...
{47355}{47428}but there's really no need|to take it out on us.
{47430}{47478}Doesn't it make you proud|to be Scottish?
{47480}{47554}It's shite being Scottish!
{47556}{47602}We're the lowest|of the low!
{47604}{47662}The scum of the fucking Earth!
{47664}{47748}The most wretched, miserable,|servile, pathetic trash...
{47750}{47810}that was ever shat|into civilization!
{47812}{47905}Some people hate English.|I don't! They're just wankers!
{47906}{47989}We, on the other hand,|are colonized by wankers!
{47991}{48088}Can't even find a decent culture|to be colonized by!
{48090}{48160}We're ruled by effete arseholes!
{48161}{48211}It's a shite state of affairs|to be in, Tommy!
{48213}{48307}And all the fresh air in the world|won't make any fucking difference!
{48512}{48576}Sorry, man. Sorry.
{48578}{48650}No, I'm sorry.|Look, I appreciate it, Tommy -
{48652}{48709} At or around|this time, Spud, Sick Boy and l...
{48711}{48781}made a healthy, informed,|democratic decision...
{48782}{48828}to get back on heroin|as soon as possible.
{48830}{48932}It took about 12 hours.
{49003}{49068}It looks easy this, but it's not.
{49070}{49137}It looks like a doss,|like a soft option.
{49138}{49250}But living like this|is a full-time business.
{49696}{49818} Ursula Andress,|the quintessential Bond girl.
{49820}{49865}That's what everyone says.
{49868}{49969}The embodiment, right,|of his superiority to us.
{49971}{50055}Beautiful, exotic,|highly sexual.
{50057}{50172}Yet totally unavailable|to anyone apart from him.
{50173}{50259}Shite. I mean,|let's face it, mate.
{50260}{50348}She'd shag one punter from Edinburgh,|she'd shag the whole fucking lot of us.
{50622}{50733}- Well done.|- Yep, I knew he was gonna do that.
{50871}{50959} Nightclubbing|We're nightclubbing
{50961}{51069}- Lizzy's gone, Mark.|She's gone and fucking dumped me.
{51071}{51145}It was that videotape...
{51147}{51233}and that lggy Pop business|and all other sorts of shite.
{51235}{51339}She told me where to go|and no fucking mistake.
{51341}{51428}I said to her, I said, "Look, is there|any chance of getting back together?"
{51430}{51491}No way. No fucking way.
{51493}{51534}Honor Blackman...
{51536}{51635}a.k.a. Pussy Galore, right?
{51637}{51703}What a total fucking misnomer.
{51742}{51814}I mean I would not touch her|with yours.
{51815}{51886}I want to try it, Mark.
{51888}{51959}You're always going on about how|it's the ultimate hit and that.
{51961}{52011}Better than sex.
{52086}{52142}Come on, man,|I'm a fucking adult.
{52145}{52207}I can find out for myself.
{52309}{52355}I've got the money.
{52429}{52520}Personality.|I mean, that's what counts, right?
{52520}{52633}Personality. I mean that's what keeps|a relationship going through the years.
{52674}{52723}Like heroin.
{52726}{52824}I mean, heroin's got|great fucking personality.
{52873}{52970} Nightclubbing|We're nightclubbing
{53002}{53063} We're walking through town
{53117}{53189} Nightclubbing|We're nightclubbing
{53191}{53270}Swanney taught us to adore and respect|the National Health Service...
{53273}{53324}for it was the source|of much of our gear.
{53325}{53396}We stole drugs.|We stole prescriptions or bought them...
{53397}{53480}sold them, swapped them,|forged them, photocopied them.
{53482}{53533}Or traded drugs|with cancer victims...
{53535}{53661}alcoholics, pensioners, AIDS patients,|epileptics and bored housewives.
{53663}{53773}We took morphine, diamorphine,|cyclozine, codeine, temazepam...
{53775}{53833}nitrazepam, phenobarbitone,|and sodium amytal...
{53835}{53934}dextropropoxyphene, methadone,|nalbuphine, pethidine, pentazocine...
{53935}{54007}buprenorphine, dextromoramide,|chlormethiazole.
{54008}{54076}The streets are awash|with drugs you can have...
{54078}{54149}for unhappiness and pain,|and we took them all.
{54152}{54245}Fuck it, we would've injected vitamin C|if only they'd made it illegal.
{54479}{54547}Pardon me, may I use your bathroom?|Thank you.
{54839}{54909}You're a psycho!
{55103}{55150}Hey, Rent boy...
{55152}{55222}no fucking smack.
{55325}{55383} But the good times|couldn't last forever.
{55440}{55557}No! My God, no!
{55558}{55631} I think Allison had|been screaming all day...
{55634}{55705}-but it hadn't really registered before.
{55705}{55771}- She might have been screaming|for a week for all I knew.
{55772}{55819}- It had been days|since I'd heard anyone speak.|- Help me!
{55821}{55905}- Though surely someone must have|said something in all that time.
{55907}{55961}- Surely to fuck someone must have.|- Allison. Allison!
{55963}{56035}- Help me, please!|- Hey, calm down!
{56037}{56121}- Everything'll be just fine.
{56122}{56171} Nothing could have|been further from the truth.
{56172}{56260}- In point of fact,|nothing was gonna be just fine.
{56262}{56322}- On the contrary,|everything was gonna be bad.
{56324}{56420}Bad. I mean, everything was gonna be|even worse than it already was.
{56423}{56473}No! My God!|No! No!
{56475}{56561}No! My God! No! No!
{56869}{56948}- Fuck.
{57083}{57178} It wasn't my baby.|She wasn't my baby.
{57180}{57232}Baby Dawn, she wasn't mine.
{57234}{57344}- Spud's, Swanney's, Sick Boy's?|I don't know.
{57345}{57407}Maybe Allison knew, maybe not.
{57410}{57484}I wished I could think|of something to say.
{57486}{57553}Something sympathetic,|something human.
{57556}{57638}Say something, Mark.
{57641}{57767}- Fucking say something, huh?
{57865}{57920}I'm cooking up.
{58345}{58467}Cook us up a shot, Rent.|I really need a hit.
{58469}{58520}And so she did.
{58521}{58636}I could understand that.|To take the pain away.
{58639}{58711}So I cooked up,|and she got a hit.
{58713}{58818}But only after me.|That went without saying.
{58850}{58897}Well, at least we knew|who the father was now.
{58898}{58990}- It wasn't just the baby|that died that day.
{58991}{59085}Something inside Sick Boy|was lost and never returned.
{59087}{59220}It seemed he had no theory with which to|explain a moment like this, nor did l.
{59221}{59290}Our only response was to keep|on going and fuck everything.
{59292}{59340}Pile misery upon misery.
{59343}{59407}Heap it up on a spoon|and dissolve it with a drop of bile.
{59408}{59504}Then squirt it into a stinking,|purulent vein and do it all over again.
{59507}{59601}Keep on going, getting up, going out,|robbing, stealing, fucking people over.
{59603}{59701}Propelling ourselves with longing|towards the day it would all go wrong.
{59703}{59759}Because no matter|how much you stash...
{59761}{59833}or how much you steal,|you never have enough.
{59835}{59900}No matter how often you go out|and rob and fuck people over...
{59901}{59960}you always need to get up|and do it all over again.
{59962}{60049}- Gangway!
{60050}{60124} Sooner or later,|this kind of thing was bound to happen.
{60279}{60343} Because shoplifting is theft,|which is a crime...
{60344}{60451}and, despite what you may believe, there|is no such entity as victimless crime.
{60453}{60537}Heroin addiction may explain your|actions, but it does not excuse them.
{60539}{60592}Mr. Murphy, you are a habitual thief...
{60594}{60644}devoid of regret and remorse.
{60645}{60724}In sentencing you to six months|imprisonment, my only worry is...
{60726}{60805}that it will not be long|before we meet again.
{60806}{60890}Mr. Renton, I understand that|you have entered into a program...
{60892}{60980}of rehabilitation in an attempt|to wean yourself away from heroin.
{60982}{61031}The suspension|of your sentence...
{61033}{61113}is conditional on your continued|cooperation with this program.
{61115}{61193}Should you stand guilty before me again,|I shall not hesitate...
{61195}{61243}to impose a custodial sentence.
{61245}{61304}Thank you, Your Honor.
{61305}{61378}With God's help,|I'll conquer this terrible affliction.
{61736}{61784}What can you say?
{61786}{61845}Well, Begbie had a phrase for it.
{61846}{61898}It was fucking obvious that|that cunt was going to fuck some cunt.
{61899}{61976}Well, I hope you learned|your lesson, son.
{61977}{62071}Oh, my son. I thought I was|gonna lose you there.
{62073}{62186}You're nothin' but trouble to me,|but I still love you.
{62187}{62257}You'd better clean up your fucking act,|sunshine. Cut that shite out forever.
{62259}{62330}You listen to Francis, Mark.|He's talking sense, kid.
{62332}{62433}You're fucking right I am. See, inside,|you wouldn't last two fucking days.
{62435}{62502}There's better things|than the needle, Rents. Choose life.
{62504}{62553}I remember|when you were a wee baby.
{62555}{62642} Oh, mama's little baby|loves shortening, shortening
{62643}{62713} Mama's little baby|loves shortening bread
{63025}{63093}I'm sorry,|Mrs. Murphy.
{63094}{63144}It wasn't fair,|Spud going down and not me.
{63218}{63295}Well, it's not our fault!
{63297}{63367}Your boy went down because|he was a fucking smack-head!
{63369}{63420}If that's not your fault,|then I don't know what is!
{63486}{63558}I was the fucking cunt|that tried to get him off it.
{63643}{63707}- I'll get the fucking drinks then, eh?|- Aye.
{63748}{63812}I wished I'd gone down instead of Spud.
{63813}{63900}Here I was surrounded|by my family and my so-called mates...
{63903}{63951}and I've never felt so alone.
{63953}{64034}Never in all my puff.
{64077}{64140}Since I was on remand,|they've had me on this program.
{64142}{64193}The state-sponsored addiction.
{64196}{64295}Three sickly sweet doses of methadone|a day instead of smack.
{64297}{64349}But it's never enough.
{64351}{64440}And, at the moment,|it's nowhere near enough.
{64441}{64490}I took all three this morning...
{64492}{64546}and now I've got 18 hours to go|'til my next shot...
{64548}{64632}and the sweat on my back|like a layer of frost.
{64633}{64708}I need to visit the Mother Superior,|for one hit.
{64710}{64772}One fucking hit...
{64774}{64852}to get us over|this long, hard day.
{64930}{64982}What's on the menu|this evening, sir?
{64984}{65058}- Your favorite dish.|- Excellent.
{65060}{65115}- Usual table, sir?|- Why, thank you.
{65117}{65225}- Would sir care to pay|for his bill in advance?|- No, stick it on my tab.
{65227}{65340}Ah, regret to inform, sir, credit limit|was reached and breached some time ago.
{65341}{65411}Oh, well, in that case -
{65413}{65500}Ah, hard currency. That'll do nicely.|Can't be too careful...
{65501}{65572}when we're dealing|with your type, can we, sir?
{65573}{65668}Would sir care for a starter?|Some garlic bread, perhaps?
{65670}{65729}No, thank you. I'll proceed directly|to the intravenous injection...
{65730}{65869}- of hard drugs, please.|- As you wish, sir. As you wish.
{66985}{67082} Just a perfect day
{67084}{67179} Drink sangria in the park
{67181}{67244} And then later
{67246}{67333} Perhaps sir would|like me to call for a taxi?
{67468}{67543} Just a perfect day
{67545}{67686}- Feed animals in the zoo
{67688}{67784} Then later, a movie too
{67786}{67894}- And then home
{67896}{68025} Oh, it's such a perfect day
{68026}{68136} I'm glad|I spent it with you
{68137}{68235}- Oh, such a perfect day
{68237}{68352}- You just keep me hanging on
{68353}{68486} You just keep me hanging on
{68586}{68700} Just a perfect day
{68701}{68820} Problems are left alone
{68821}{68896} Weekenders on our own
{68897}{68998} It's such fun
{69080}{69177} Just a perfect day
{69179}{69292} You made me forget myself
{69293}{69420} I thought I was someone else|Someone good
{69505}{69633} Oh, it's such a perfect day
{69635}{69767} I'm glad I spent it with you
{69769}{69841} Oh, such a perfect day
{69843}{69956}- You just keep me hanging on
{69957}{70087}- You just keep me hanging on
{70437}{70531}- Open your eyes! Come on, wake up!
{70533}{70588} You're going to reap|just what you sow
{70700}{70841} You're going to reap|just what you sow
{70916}{70983}- You're going to reap
{70985}{71121}- Just what you sow
{71180}{71237} You're going to reap
{71238}{71351} Just what you sow
{72719}{72835}I don't feel the sickness yet,|but it's in the mail, that's for sure.
{72837}{72896}I'm in the junkie limbo|at the moment.
{72897}{72997}Too ill to sleep,|too tired to stay awake.
{72999}{73072}But the sickness is on its way.
{73073}{73171}Sweat, chills, nausea,|pain and craving.
{73173}{73270}Need, like nothing else I've ever known,|will soon take hold of me.
{73272}{73338}It's on its way.
{73457}{73532} You've got green eyes|Ooh, you've got blue eyes
{73534}{73617} Ooh, you've got gray eyes
{73619}{73717} And I've never seen anyone|quite like you
{73719}{73772} Before
{73774}{73900} No, I never met anyone|quite like you before
{74293}{74361}We'll help you, son.
{74363}{74435}You'll stay here with us|'til you get better.
{74437}{74521}- Gonna beat this together.|- Maybe l -
{74523}{74584}- Maybe I should go back to the clinic.|- No.
{74586}{74652}No clinics. No methadone.
{74654}{74742}That only made you worse.|You said so yourself.
{74780}{74862}You lied to us, son.|Your own mother...
{74864}{74916}- and father.|- You could bring us some jellies.
{74918}{75008}No! You're worse coming off that|than you are with the heroin.
{75010}{75090}- Nothing at all!|- It's a clean break this time.
{75092}{75138}You're staying here|where we can keep an eye on you.
{75140}{75229}I appreciate what you're trying|to do, I really do,|but I just need one more score.
{75231}{75306}Just bring me one more hit, please.
{75308}{75410}- I need one more fucking hit!
{75412}{75489}- You fuck!
{75537}{75594}Bitch! Bitch!
{75909}{76031}Well, this is|a good fucking laugh, isn't it?
{76033}{76094}You sweat that shite|out of your system.
{76096}{76156}'Cause if I come back|and it's still here...
{76157}{76229}I'll fucking kick it out.
{76231}{76289}- Okay?
{76497}{76543}God.
{76890}{76940}Question number one:
{76942}{77017}The human immunodeficiency|virus is a -
{77019}{77119}- Retrovirus.|- Retrovirus is the right answer!
{77350}{77433}It's a mug's game, Mrs. Renton.
{77435}{77526}I mean, I'm not saying I was|blameless myself. Far from it.
{77528}{77607}But there comes a time when you have to|turn your back on all that nonsense...
{77609}{77664}and just say no.
{77774}{77916}- Just say no.|- Oh, my God, she's dead!
{78089}{78140}No!
{78543}{78610}- Question number two:
{78612}{78731}H.I.V. binds to which receptor|on the host lymphocyte?
{78733}{78801}Which receptor is that?
{78931}{79037}- CD-4.|- CD-4 is the right answer!
{79123}{79187}Better than sex, Rents.
{79189}{79249}Better than sex.
{79251}{79321}The ultimate hit.
{79323}{79430}I'm a fucking adult.|I can find out for myself.
{79432}{79496}Well, I'm finding out, all right.
{79620}{79668}Tommy.
{79670}{79765}- No.
{79767}{79825}Stop it. Dawn, stop it.
{79826}{79915}Is he guilty or not guilty?
{79965}{80028}- He's our son.
{80197}{80316}No! Dawn! Dawn!
{80317}{80388}Stop! No! Dawn!
{80389}{80478}Oh, no! Dawn!|No, not me!
{80480}{80537}- Stop!
{80628}{80684}- Mark.
{80685}{80764}- Mark.
{80765}{80844}Mark.
{80889}{80959}There's something|you need to do.
{81437}{81476}Ow.
{81668}{81714}Come alive, 35.
{81716}{81803}Box of tricks, 66.
{81805}{81881}Mark. Mark, you get the house!
{81883}{81943}- House! House!
{81945}{81987}For goodness sake, Mark.
{81989}{82087} It seems, however,|I am the luckiest guy in the world.
{82089}{82147}Several years of addiction|right in the middle of an epidemic...
{82149}{82204}surrounded by the living dead.
{82206}{82330}But not me. I'm negative.|It's official.
{82332}{82406}And once the pain goes away,|that's when the real battle starts:
{82408}{82455}depression, boredom.
{82457}{82553}You feel so fucking low,|you want to fucking top yourself.
{82585}{82656} Tommy!
{82657}{82741}Tommy!
{82743}{82847}Tommy, it's Mark, man.
{83052}{83100}All right, mate?
{83631}{83703}- Gettin' out much, Tommy?|- No.
{83776}{83823}Following the game at all?
{83825}{83910}- No.
{83912}{83982}Nah, me neither, really.
{84220}{84272}You take the test?
{84308}{84355}Aye.
{84398}{84460}Clear?
{84462}{84512}Aye.
{84546}{84596}That's nice.
{84646}{84695}I'm sorry, Tommy.
{84770}{84890}- Got any gear on you?|- No, I'm clean, man.
{84892}{85021}Well...|sub us then, mate.
{85022}{85079}I'm expecting a rent check.
{85380}{85463}- Thanks, Mark.
{85465}{85524}No bother.
{85619}{85720} No bother.|None at all. Not for me, anyway.
{85722}{85772}-Still, it's easy to be philosophical...
{85774}{85847}when it's some other poor cunt|with shite for blood.
{86033}{86113}- What do you want?|- Are you clean?
{86115}{86161}- Yes.|- Is that a promise then?
{86163}{86203}Yes, it is,|as a matter of fact.
{86205}{86297}Calm down.|I'm only asking.
{86357}{86445}- Is that hash I can smell?|- No.
{86447}{86495}- I wouldn't mind a bit if it is.|- Well, it isn't.
{86497}{86581}- It smells like it.|- You're too young.
{86583}{86652}I'm too young for what?
{86785}{86879} You're not getting|any younger, Mark.
{86881}{86981}The world's changing. Music's changing.|Even drugs are changing.
{86983}{87045}You can't stay in here all day|dreaming about heroin...
{87047}{87124}- and Ziggy Pop.|- It's lggy Pop.
{87125}{87195}Whatever.|I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
{87197}{87288}Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured|last year. Tommy went to see him.
{87289}{87361}The point is, you've got to find|something new.
{87404}{87497} She was right.|I had to find something new.
{87499}{87548}There was only|one thing for it.
{87671}{87763} So find the feelin'
{87831}{87936} So find the feelin'
{88009}{88104} So find the feelin'
{88199}{88265} Bom Digi Digi Digi|Bom Digi Bom
{88589}{88646}Lifestyle Letting Agency.
{88648}{88700}Oh, yes, it's a beautifully converted|Victorian town house.
{88701}{88804}Ideally located on a quiet road|near to the local shops and transport.
{88805}{88877}Um, this one's two bedrooms|and a kitchen/diner.
{88878}{88944}Fully fitted,|in excellent decorative order.
{88946}{89000}Lots of storage space|and all mod cons.
{89001}{89080}It's going at 320 a week.
{89254}{89337} I settled in|not too badly and kept myself to myself.
{89338}{89428}Sometimes, of course,|I thought about the guys,|but mainly I didn't miss them at all.
{89430}{89525}After all, this was boomtown,|where any fool could make cash|from chaos, and plenty did.
{89526}{89575} Tell you what I've got.
{89577}{89652}I've got a beautifully converted|Victorian town house.
{89654}{89701}I quite enjoyed the sound of it all:
{89702}{89749}profit, loss, margins...
{89750}{89809}takeovers, lending,|letting, subletting...
{89810}{89888}subdividing, cheating, scamming,|fragmenting, breaking away.
{89890}{89937}Who's got the keys|to Telegraph Road?
{89938}{89995}There was no such thing as society,|and even if there was...
{89997}{90064}I most certainly|had nothing to do with it.
{90066}{90158}For the first time in my adult life,|I was almost content.
{90160}{90286} Dear Mark, I'm glad|you found a job and somewhere to live.
{90288}{90335}School is fine at the moment.
{90337}{90398}I'm not pregnant,|but thanks for asking.
{90400}{90479}Your friend, Sick Boy, asked me last|week if I would like to work for him...
{90481}{90538}but I told him where to go.
{90540}{90647}I met Spud, who sends his regards.|Or at least I think that's what he said.
{90721}{90776}No one has seen Tommy for ages.
{90778}{90863}And, finally, Francis Begbie has been|on television a lot this week...
{90865}{90915}as he is wanted|by the police in connection...
{90917}{90983}with an armed robbery|in a jeweler's in Corstorphine.
{90985}{91055}Take care.|Yours with love, Diane.
{91217}{91264}Francis Begbie.
{91385}{91440}Oh, no.
{91442}{91503}Armed robbery?|What, with a replica?
{91505}{91596}- How the fuck can it be armed|robbery with a fucking replica?
{91597}{91685}Fucking scandal.|The gear. Look.
{91725}{91841}Supposed to be fucking solid silver.|It's fucking garbage.
{91843}{91913}Those young couples investin' all their|fucking hopes in that stuff and all.
{91915}{91985}- It's a scandal, Franco.|- Too fucking right it is.
{91987}{92073}How about the wee pot noodles|by the way? I'm fucking Lee Marvin.
{92247}{92317}Hey, Rents.
{92319}{92393}Begbie settled in in no time at all.
{92395}{92470}Fucking find cigarettes.
{92581}{92634}- We didn't have nowhere to live
{92636}{92713}- Aye.|- We didn't have nowhere to go
{92715}{92821} 'Til someone said I know|this place I've been before
{92823}{92889} It was on the 15th floor
{92891}{92953}- It had a bar across the door
{92955}{93060} It took an hour to cross it off|and get inside
{93061}{93124} It smelled as if|someone had died
{93125}{93180} The living room|was full of flies
{93181}{93280}- The kitchen sink was -|- Begs?
{93281}{93380}- Ooh, it's a mess all right|- Begs!
{93381}{93492}- Yes, it's my house
{93494}{93560}Yeah, the guy's a psycho. But it's true.
{93561}{93612}He's a mate also.|What can I do?
{93613}{93660} I was living in the sky
{93661}{93732} I never thought|I'd live so high
{93733}{93832} Just like heaven|if it didn't look like hell
{93833}{93892} The lift is always|full of piss
{93893}{93968} The fifth floor landing|smells of fish
{93969}{94067} Not just on Friday|Every single other day
{94069}{94175}- Hey, pop down to bookie's|and put a line on for us.
{94177}{94252}- Can you not go yourself?|- I'm serious here.
{94253}{94308}I'm a fugitive from the law, and I can't|even walk the fuckin' streets.
{94309}{94364}You go.
{94365}{94420}Here.
{94421}{94494}Doncaster.|Four-forty.
{94496}{94558}Five pound to win.|Bad Boy.
{94772}{94858}Fucking buy|some fucking beer and all.
{94980}{95028} Come on, Bad Boy.
{95030}{95102}Come on, son. Come on, son.|Come on! Come on!
{95104}{95187}Yeah!
{95189}{95310}Yeah!
{95312}{95398}Bad Boy!
{95400}{95455}Came in at 16 to 1.
{95457}{95556}And with the winnings,|we went out to celebrate.
{96197}{96292} Diane was right.|The world is changing.
{96294}{96352}Music is changing.|Drugs are changing.
{96353}{96401}Even men and women|are changing.
{96402}{96497}One thousand years from now, there'll be|no guys and no girls, just wankers.
{96498}{96566}- Sounds great to me.
{96649}{96700}It's just a pity no one told Begbie.
{97117}{97190}Fuck! Fuck!
{97192}{97264}lf you ask me, we're heterosexual|by default not by decision.
{97266}{97335}It's just a question|of who you fancy.
{97337}{97400}It's all about aesthetics.|And it's fuck-all to do with morality.
{97402}{97456}Fuck!
{97502}{97561}But you try telling Begbie that.
{97562}{97620}Look, I'm not a fucking buftie,|and that's the end of it.
{97621}{97686}Let's face it,|it could have been wonderful.
{97765}{97840}Fucking listen to me,|you piece of junkie shit.
{97841}{97947}A joke's a fucking joke. You mention|that again, and I'll cut you up.
{97948}{98008}You understand?
{98133}{98179}Since I last saw him...
{98181}{98244}Sick Boy had reinvented himself|as a pimp and a pusher...
{98246}{98305}and was here, he said,|to mix business and pleasure...
{98306}{98388}setting up contacts,|as he constantly informed me...
{98390}{98485}for the great smack deal|that was one day going to make him rich.
{98626}{98680}Good chips.
{98682}{98776}I can't believe|you did that.
{98777}{98899}I got a good price for it.|Rents, I need the money.
{98901}{98955}It was my fucking telly!
{98957}{99027}Christ, if I'd known you were|gonna get so humpty about it...
{99029}{99079}I wouldn't have bothered.
{99141}{99215}Fucking rented anyway.
{99217}{99273}Are you gonna eat that?
{99392}{99439}Have you got a passport?
{99441}{99487}Why?
{99489}{99535}I met this bloke.
{99537}{99591}Runs a hotel, brothel.
{99593}{99639}Loads of contacts.
{99640}{99723}Does a nice sideline in punting|British passports to foreigners.
{99725}{99775}Get you a good price.
{99776}{99847}And why would I want|to sell my passport?
{99941}{99987}It was just an idea.
{100016}{100071}I had to get rid of them.
{100073}{100143}Sick Boy didn't do his drug deal,|and he didn't get rich.
{100145}{100241}Instead, he and Begbie just hung around|my bedsit looking for things to steal.
{100243}{100332}I decided to offer them one of London's|most desirable properties.
{100953}{101013}- But, of course,|they weren't paying any rent.
{101015}{101077}So when my boss found|two desperate suckers who would...
{101079}{101157}Sick Boy and Begbie were bound|to feel threatened.
{101159}{101217}Yep, lots of storage.
{101218}{101281}All mod cons, 320 quid a week.
{101334}{101408}- And that was that.
{101409}{101481}But by then we had|another reason to go back:
{101482}{101529}Tommy.
{101529}{101624} Tommy knew he'd got the virus,|but he never knew he's gone full blown.
{101627}{101691}What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
{101692}{101755}No, toxoplasmosis.
{101757}{101807}It's like a stroke.
{101809}{101855}How's that?
{101857}{101908}He wanted to see Lizzy again.
{101909}{101983}She wouldn't even|let him near the house.
{101984}{102060}So he bought her a present.|He brought her this kitten.
{102061}{102154}- But Lizzy told him|where to fucking stick it.|- Exactly.
{102157}{102237}"l'm not wantin' that cat," she says.|"Get the fuck, right."
{102239}{102315}So there's Tommy stuck|with this kitten.
{102317}{102422}- You can imagine what happened.|- To those of us gathered here today...
{102424}{102541}Thomas McKenzie filled a number|of different roles in our lives.
{102543}{102594}- Thomas was a son,|a brother and a friend.|- The thing was neglected...
{102597}{102650}pissing and shitting|all over the place.
{102653}{102706}- Tommy's lying about fucked out|of his eyeballs...
{102709}{102755}on smack or downers.
{102757}{102847}He never knew you could get|toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
{102849}{102965} A loving man|who had a great lust for life.
{102966}{103022}- A keen musician -|- Neither did l. What is it?
{103025}{103077}- Fucking horrible.
{103078}{103149}- It's like an abscess on your brain.|- Fucking hell.
{103151}{103201}- Then what happened?
{103202}{103261} He starts getting|these headaches...
{103263}{103345}- so he just uses more smack,|you know, for the pain.|- Right.
{103347}{103472}And then he has a stroke.|A fucking stroke, just like that.
{103475}{103565}Gets home from the hospital|and dies three weeks later.
{103567}{103641} He'd been dead|for ages before the neighbors...
{103642}{103729}complained about the smell and|got the police to break down the door.
{103731}{103809}- Tommy was lying facedown|in a pool of vomit.
{103811}{103937} He has gone from us, but we|have many things to remember him by.
{103939}{104043}- The kitten was fine.|- Would you all please rise now|for the committal?
{104148}{104240} Do you think|I would leave you crying
{104243}{104354} When there's room|on my horse for two
{104356}{104485} Climb up here, Tommy|Don't be dying
{104487}{104600} I can go just as fast|with two
{104600}{104719} When we grow up|we'll both be soldiers
{104721}{104824} And our horses|will not be toys
{104825}{104952} And I wonder|if we'll remember
{104953}{105084} When we were|two little boys
{105135}{105185}- Tommy.|- Tommy.
{105297}{105356}Did you tell him yet?
{105356}{105412}- On you go.|- What?
{105412}{105463}There's this mate of Swanney's.
{105465}{105569}- You know the guy. Mikey Forrester.|- Aye.
{105570}{105667}Well... he's come|into some gear.
{105669}{105750}- A lot of gear.|- How much gear?
{105793}{105856}About two kilos.
{105857}{105912}So he tells me.
{105913}{105993}He got drunk in a pub|down by the docks last week...
{105996}{106058}where he met|two Russian sailors.
{106060}{106150}They're fucking carrying the stuff.|For sale there and then, like.
{106151}{106234}So he wakes up next morning...
{106236}{106318}realizes what he's done,|gets very fucking nervous.
{106319}{106375}He wants rid of this, right?
{106377}{106451}- So?|- So he met me.
{106453}{106538}And I offered to take it off his hands|at a very reasonable price...
{106540}{106626}with the intention of punting it|on myself to a guy I know in London.
{106628}{106694} We've just come back|from Tommy's funeral...
{106696}{106779}and you're talking|about a skag deal?
{106781}{106830}Aye.
{106904}{106966}What was your price?
{106968}{107015}- Four grand.|- You haven't got four grand.
{107017}{107109}- We're 2,000 short.|- Well, that's tough.
{107112}{107209}Look, Mark, every cunt knows|you've been saving up in London.
{107212}{107282}- I'm sorry, boys.|I do not have two grand.
{107284}{107335} Aye, you fucking do.
{107337}{107413}I've seen|your bank statement.
{107415}{107486}- For fuck's sake.|- Two thousand...
{107489}{107578}one hundred|and thirty-three pound.
{107580}{107656}Two kilos.|What is that, ten years?
{107658}{107744}Mikey Forrester. Russian sailors.|What the fuck are you boys on?
{107745}{107800}Eh? Spud, you've already|been to jail.
{107802}{107849}What's the deal?|You like it so much you want to go back?
{107850}{107909}I just want the money, Mark.
{107909}{108014}If everybody keeps their fucking mouth|shut, there'll be no cunt going to jail.
{108134}{108194}I hadn't told anyone everything|that was running through my mind...
{108196}{108244}about what might happen|in London.
{108246}{108320}There were a lot of possibilities|I didn't want to talk to anyone about.
{108322}{108396}Ideas best kept to myself.
{108398}{108456}What no one told me was that|when we bought the smack...
{108458}{108529}some lucky punter|would have to try it out.
{108611}{108664}Begbie didn't trust Spud.
{108665}{108720}Sick Boy was too careful|these days.
{108721}{108796}So I rolled up my sleeve,|I spiked my vein...
{108798}{108847}and I did what had to be done.
{108929}{108983}It's good.
{108985}{109042}Oh, it's really|fucking good.
{109159}{109210}Yeah, that hit was good.
{109213}{109287}I promised myself another one|before we got to London.
{109289}{109355}Just the one hit.|Just for old time's sake.
{109357}{109431}Just to piss Begbie off.
{109433}{109504}This was his nightmare.
{109504}{109559}The dodgiest scam|in a lifetime of dodgy scams.
{109560}{109683}Being perpetrated with three of the most|useless and unreliable fuckups in town.
{109684}{109730}I knew what was going on|in his mind.
{109733}{109795}Any trouble in London,|and he would dump us immediately.
{109797}{109851}One way or another,|he had to.
{109853}{109910}If he got caught|with a bag full of smack...
{109913}{110007}on top of that armed robbery shit,|he was going down for 15 to 20.
{110009}{110143}Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he|didn't shite it off 20 years in prison.
{110304}{110377}This was to be my final hit.
{110379}{110425}But let's be clear about this.
{110427}{110496}There's final hits|and final hits.
{110499}{110549}What kind was this to be?
{110671}{110754}- Did you bring the cards?|- What?
{110756}{110806}The cards. The last thing I|told you was to mind the cards.
{110808}{110854}Well, I've not brought them.
{110914}{111002}- Fucking boring after|a while without the cards.|- I'm sorry.
{111004}{111097}- But fucking late, like.|- Why didn't you bring them?
{111099}{111159}'Cause I fucking told you|to bring them, you doss cunt!
{111161}{111223}Christ.
{112355}{112401}These are your friends, right?
{112402}{112468}These are the guys I told you about.|- Okay.
{112471}{112536}- Well, is he here?|- Yeah, he's here.
{112539}{112585}You didn't get followed|or nothing, did you?
{112587}{112665}- Didn't get followed.|- Okay.
{113078}{113148}- All right.|- Hi.
{113197}{113260} Straight away|he clocked us for what we were:
{113261}{113338}small-time wasters|with an accidental big deal.
{113537}{113624}- Excuse me, gentlemen.
{114884}{114962} So...
{114964}{115013}how much would you|like for this?
{115064}{115111}Twenty thousand.
{115168}{115237}Well, I don't think|it's worth much more than 15.
{115240}{115326}This was a real drag to him.|He didn't need to negotiate.
{115327}{115390}I mean, what the fuck were we going|to do with it if he didn't buy it?
{115392}{115461}Sell it on the streets?|Fuck that.
{115463}{115492}Well, 19.
{115493}{115596}Terribly sorry.|I can't go to 19.
{115628}{115677}Well, fucking 16 then.
{115680}{115767}Okay.
{115769}{115834}"Well, fucking 16"|it is then.
{115916}{116015} These, gentlemen,|are 2,000 bundles.
{116017}{116071}That's two.
{116074}{116141}That's four.
{116143}{116192}We settled on 16,000.|- Now you have six.
{116194}{116272}He had a lot more in the suitcase,|like, but it was better than nothing.
{116273}{116324}And two more make eight.
{116433}{116499}Thank you very much,|gentlemen.
{116502}{116616}- I'd just like to say,|it's been a pleasure haggling with you.|- Fucking better be.
{116669}{116716}Okay?
{116774}{116820}Yes!
{116822}{116869}- Fucking -
{116870}{116944} And just|for a moment, it felt really great.
{116946}{117034}Like we were all in it together,|like friends. Like it meant something.
{117037}{117112}- A moment like that|can touch you deep inside.
{117113}{117161}But it doesn't last long.|Not like 16,000.
{117162}{117235}So what about you, Spud? Any major|investments on the horizon at all?
{117237}{117331}- Gonna buy yourself|a wee island in the sun?|- For four grand?
{117333}{117408}One palm tree, a couple of rocks|and a fucking sewage outflow.
{117481}{117570}I don't know, man. I'm gonna|get something for my ma, I think.
{117572}{117626}Get some good speed.
{117627}{117675}No bicarb.
{117677}{117751}- Then get a girl,|take her out, treat her right.|- And shag her senseless.
{117753}{117835}No, man!|True love. True love.
{117837}{117895}Eh, but I could really handle|some hot sex...
{117897}{117970}- with a Jewish princess!|- You daft cunt!
{117972}{118037}- Or a Catholic!|- If you're gonna waste it on a bird...
{118038}{118087}you might as well fucking|leave it all to me.
{118089}{118123}- Get our drinks.|- I got a round already.
{118125}{118195}- I got the last ones.|- It's your round, Franco.
{118225}{118279}Okay. Same again?
{118281}{118342}Right. I'm off for a piss.
{118344}{118410}See when I get back|the money's still here, okay?
{118413}{118468}The moment your back's turned,|we're out the door.
{118469}{118509}Yeah, I'll be right|fucking after you.
{118511}{118559}You'll never catch us,|you flabby bastard.
{118561}{118607}By the way,|see you when I get back.
{118609}{118679}Be halfway down the street|with the money.
{118680}{118767}- I'd fucking kill you.|- Aye, I thought you might, Franco.
{118769}{118828}Thought you might.
{118875}{118935}Are you game for it?
{118937}{118996}What?
{118999}{119071}Well?
{119073}{119136}Are you serious?
{119331}{119417}Don't know. Don't know.|What do you think?
{119419}{119494}Still here, I see.
{119496}{119569}- Aye. Well, we wouldn't|run out on a mate, eh?|- Why not? I know I would.
{119571}{119653}Where's Franco?
{119679}{119752}For fuck's sake!
{119755}{119805}Sorry, mate.|I'll buy you another one.
{119807}{119881}You've ruined my fucking suit,|you fucking idiot!
{119884}{119931} Look, I'm sorry.|I didn't mean it.
{119932}{119996}Sorry's not going to dry me off,|you cunt.
{119997}{120044}Cool down, Franco.|The man says he's sorry.
{120047}{120112}He's sorry enough|for being a fat cunt.
{120115}{120205}Fuck you. If you can't hold a pint, you|shouldn't be in the pub, mate. Fuck off.
{120380}{120452}Oh, no!
{120576}{120629}No, Franco, don't do it, man.
{120630}{120703}- For fuck's sake!
{120705}{120771}- Fucking nice one, Franco!|- Shut it.
{120773}{120855}- You cut me, man!|- You were in my fucking way.
{120951}{121060}Anybody else want to get|in my fucking way? You?
{121097}{121154}You?
{121240}{121293}Hey, Rent boy...
{121295}{121408}you bring me down|a fucking smoke.
{121408}{121488}- I think|we'd better go, Franco!|- I've got to go to the hospital!
{121488}{121561}You're not going to any fucking|hospital, and you're staying there!
{121621}{121689}You bring me down|a fucking cigarette.
{121836}{121890}And the bag.
{126890}{127003} Now I've justified|this to myself in all sorts of ways.
{127005}{127071}It wasn't a big deal,|just a minor betrayal.
{127073}{127158}Or we'd outgrown each other.|You know, that sort of thing.
{127161}{127214}But let's face it.|I ripped them off.
{127217}{127270}My so-called mates.
{127273}{127331}But Begbie -|I couldn't give a shit about him.
{127333}{127447}And Sick Boy. He'd have done the same|to me, if he'd only thought of it first.
{127449}{127569}And Spud - Well, okay, I felt sorry|for Spud. He never hurt anybody.
{127725}{127771} Bastard!
{127901}{127977} Bastard!
{128179}{128285}- Open up. Open up now!
{128286}{128381}Bastard!|Bastard!
{128384}{128449}So why did I do it?
{128451}{128521}I could offer|a million answers, all false.
{128522}{128581}The truth is|that I'm a bad person.
{128583}{128661}But that's gonna change.|I'm going to change.
{128663}{128709}This is the last|of that sort of thing.
{128711}{128757}Now I'm cleaning up,|and I'm moving on.
{128758}{128809}Going straight|and choosing life.
{128811}{128869}I'm looking forward|to it already.
{128871}{128916}I'm gonna be just like you.
{128919}{128988}The job, the family,|the fucking big television...
{128989}{129076}the washing machine,|the car, the compact disc|and electrical tin opener...
{129077}{129136}good health, low cholesterol,|dental insurance...
{129137}{129204}mortgage, starter home,|leisure wear, luggage...
{129205}{129292}three-piece suite, D.I.Y.,|game shows, junk food, children...
{129293}{129356}walks in the park,|nine-to-five, good at golf...
{129356}{129424}washing the car, choice of sweaters,|family Christmas...
{129424}{129488}indexed pension, tax exemption,|clearing gutters...
{129489}{129560}getting by, looking ahead,|the day you die.
